30,THOMAS MOORE,
31,THOMAS MOORE,Thomas Moore was born in Dublin on the 28th of May 1780. Both his parents
32,THOMAS MOORE,"were Roman-Catholics; and he was, as a matter of course, brought up in the"
33,THOMAS MOORE,"same religion, and adhered to it--not perhaps with any extreme"
34,THOMAS MOORE,"zeal--throughout his life. His father was a decent tradesman, a grocer and"
35,THOMAS MOORE,"spirit-retailer--or ""spirit-grocer,"" as the business is termed in Ireland."
36,THOMAS MOORE,"Thomas received his schooling from Mr. Samuel Whyte, who had been"
37,THOMAS MOORE,"Sheridan's first preceptor, a man of more than average literary culture."
38,THOMAS MOORE,"He encouraged a taste for acting among the boys: and Moore, naturally"
39,THOMAS MOORE,"intelligent and lively, became a favorite with his master, and a leader in"
40,THOMAS MOORE,the dramatic recreations.
41,THOMAS MOORE,
42,THOMAS MOORE,His aptitude for verse appeared at an early age. In 1790 he composed an
43,THOMAS MOORE,"epilogue to a piece acted at the house of Lady Borrows, in Dublin; and in"
44,THOMAS MOORE,"his fourteenth year he wrote a sonnet to Mr. Whyte, which was published in"
45,THOMAS MOORE,a Dublin magazine.
46,THOMAS MOORE,
47,THOMAS MOORE,"Like other Irish Roman-Catholics, galled by the hard and stiff collar of"
48,THOMAS MOORE,"Protestant ascendancy, the parents of Thomas Moore hailed the French"
49,THOMAS MOORE,"Revolution, and the prospects which it seemed to offer of some reflex"
50,THOMAS MOORE,ameliorations. In 1792 the lad was taken by his father to a dinner in
51,THOMAS MOORE,honor of the Revolution; and he was soon launched upon a current of ideas
52,THOMAS MOORE,and associations which might have conducted a person of more
53,THOMAS MOORE,self-oblivious patriotism to the scaffold on which perished the friend of
54,THOMAS MOORE,"his opening manhood, Robert Emmet. Trinity College, Dublin, having been"
55,THOMAS MOORE,"opened to Catholics by the Irish Parliament in 1793, Moore was entered"
56,THOMAS MOORE,there as a student in the succeeding year. He became more proficient in
57,THOMAS MOORE,"French and Italian than in the classic languages, and showed no turn for"
58,THOMAS MOORE,"Latin verses. Eventually, his political proclivities, and intimacy with"
59,THOMAS MOORE,"many of the chiefs of opposition, drew down upon him (after various"
60,THOMAS MOORE,"interrogations, in which he honorably refused to implicate his friends) a"
61,THOMAS MOORE,severe admonition from the University authorities; but he had not joined
62,THOMAS MOORE,in any distinctly rebellious act and no more formidable results ensued to
63,THOMAS MOORE,him.
64,THOMAS MOORE,
65,THOMAS MOORE,In 1793 Moore published in the _Anthologia Hibernica_ two pieces of verse;
66,THOMAS MOORE,and his budding talents became so far known as to earn him the proud
67,THOMAS MOORE,"eminence of Laureate to the Gastronomic Club of Dalkey, near Dublin, in"
68,THOMAS MOORE,"1794. Through his acquaintance with Emmet, he joined the Oratorical"
69,THOMAS MOORE,"Society, and afterwards the more important Historical Society; and he"
70,THOMAS MOORE,"published _An Ode on Nothing, with Notes, by Trismegistus Rustifucius, D."
71,THOMAS MOORE,"D._, which won a party success. About the same time he wrote articles for"
72,THOMAS MOORE,"_The Press_, a paper founded towards the end of 1797 by O'Connor, Addis,"
73,THOMAS MOORE,"Emmet, and others. He graduated at Trinity College in November, 1799."
74,THOMAS MOORE,
75,THOMAS MOORE,"The bar was the career which his parents, and especially his mother,"
76,THOMAS MOORE,wished Thomas to pursue; neither of them had much faith in poetry or
77,THOMAS MOORE,"literature as a resource for his subsistence. Accordingly, in 1799, he"
78,THOMAS MOORE,"crossed over into England, and studied in the Middle Temple; and he was"
79,THOMAS MOORE,"afterwards called to the bar, but literary pursuits withheld him from"
80,THOMAS MOORE,practicing. He had brought with him from Ireland his translations from
81,THOMAS MOORE,"Anacreon; and published these by subscription in 1800, dedicated to the"
82,THOMAS MOORE,"Prince Regent (then the illusory hope of political reformers), with no"
83,THOMAS MOORE,"inconsiderable success. Lord Moira, Lady Donegal, and other leaders of"
84,THOMAS MOORE,"fashionable society, took him up with friendly warmth, and he soon found"
85,THOMAS MOORE,himself a well-accepted guest in the highest circles in London. No clever
86,THOMAS MOORE,"young fellow--without any advantage of birth or of person, and with"
87,THOMAS MOORE,intellectual attractions which seem to posterity to be of a rather
88,THOMAS MOORE,middling kind--ever won his way more easily or more cheaply into that
89,THOMAS MOORE,"paradise of mean ambitions, the _beau monde_. Moore has not escaped"
90,THOMAS MOORE,the stigma which attaches to almost all men who thus succeeded under the
91,THOMAS MOORE,like conditions--that of tuft-hunting and lowering compliances. He would
92,THOMAS MOORE,be a bold man who should affirm that there was absolutely no sort of
93,THOMAS MOORE,"ground for the charge; or that Moore--fêted at Holland House, and"
94,THOMAS MOORE,"hovered-round by the fashionable of both sexes, the men picking up his"
95,THOMAS MOORE,"witticisms, and the women languishing over his songs--was capable of the"
96,THOMAS MOORE,same sturdy self-reliance and simple adhesion to principle which might
97,THOMAS MOORE,"possibly have been in him, and forthcoming from him, under different"
98,THOMAS MOORE,"conditions. Who shall touch pitch and not be defiled,--who treacle, and"
99,THOMAS MOORE,"not be sweetened? At the same time, it is easy to carry charges of this"
100,THOMAS MOORE,"kind too far, and not always through motives the purest and most exalted."
101,THOMAS MOORE,It may be said without unfairness on either side that the sort of talents
102,THOMAS MOORE,which Moore possessed brought him naturally into the society which he
103,THOMAS MOORE,frequented; that very possibly the world has got quite as much out of him
104,THOMAS MOORE,by that development of his faculties as by any other which they could have
105,THOMAS MOORE,been likely to receive; and that he repaid patronage in the coin of
106,THOMAS MOORE,"amusement and of bland lenitives, rather than in that of obsequious"
107,THOMAS MOORE,adulation. For we are not required nor permitted to suppose that there was
108,THOMAS MOORE,"the stuff of a hero in ""little Tom Moore;"" or that the lapdog of the"
109,THOMAS MOORE,drawing-room would under any circumstances have been the wolf-hound of the
110,THOMAS MOORE,"public sheepfold. In the drawing-room he is a sleeker lapdog, and lies"
111,THOMAS MOORE,"upon more and choicelier-clothed laps than he would in ""the two-pair"
112,THOMAS MOORE,"back;"" and that is about all that needs to be said or speculated in such a"
113,THOMAS MOORE,"case. As a matter of fact, the demeanor of Moore among the socially great"
114,THOMAS MOORE,"seems to have been that of a man who respected his company, without"
115,THOMAS MOORE,failing to respect himself also--any ill-natured caviling or ready-made
116,THOMAS MOORE,imputations to the contrary notwithstanding.
117,THOMAS MOORE,
118,THOMAS MOORE,"In 1802 Moore produced his first volume of original verse, the _Poetical"
119,THOMAS MOORE,Works of the late Thomas Little_ (an allusion to the author's remarkably
120,THOMAS MOORE,"small stature), for which he received £60. There are in this volume some"
121,THOMAS MOORE,"erotic improprieties, not of a very serious kind either in intention or in"
122,THOMAS MOORE,"harmfulness, which Moore regretted in later years. Next year Lord Moira"
123,THOMAS MOORE,procured him the post of Registrar to the Admiralty Court of Bermuda; he
124,THOMAS MOORE,"embarked on the 25th of September, and reached his destination in January"
125,THOMAS MOORE,1804. This work did not suit him much better than the business of the bar;
126,THOMAS MOORE,"in March he withdrew from personal discharge of the duties: and, leaving a"
127,THOMAS MOORE,"substitute in his place, he made a tour in the United States and Canada."
128,THOMAS MOORE,"He was presented to Jefferson, and felt impressed by his republican"
129,THOMAS MOORE,"simplicity. Such a quality, however, was not in Moore's line; and nothing"
130,THOMAS MOORE,perhaps shows the essential smallness of his nature more clearly than the
131,THOMAS MOORE,"fact that his visit to the United States, in their giant infancy, produced"
132,THOMAS MOORE,"in him no glow of admiration or aspiration, but only a recrudescence of"
133,THOMAS MOORE,"the commonest prejudices--the itch for picking little holes, the petty joy"
134,THOMAS MOORE,"of reporting them, and the puny self-pluming upon fancied or factitious"
135,THOMAS MOORE,superiorities. If the washy liberal patriotism of Moore's very early years
136,THOMAS MOORE,"had any vitality at all, such as would have qualified it for a harder"
137,THOMAS MOORE,"struggle than jeering at the Holy Alliance, and singing after-dinner songs"
138,THOMAS MOORE,"of national sentimentalism to the applause of Whig lords and ladies, this"
139,THOMAS MOORE,American experience may beheld to have been its death-blow. He now saw
140,THOMAS MOORE,"republicans face to face; and found that they were not for him, nor he for"
141,THOMAS MOORE,them. He returned to England in 1806; and soon afterwards published his
142,THOMAS MOORE,"_Odes and Epistles_, comprising many remarks, faithfully expressive of his"
143,THOMAS MOORE,"perceptions, on American society and manners."
144,THOMAS MOORE,
145,THOMAS MOORE,"The volume was tartly criticised in the _Edinburgh Review_ by Jeffrey, who"
146,THOMAS MOORE,made some rather severe comments upon the improprieties chargeable to
147,THOMAS MOORE,"Moore's early writings. The consequence was a challenge, and what would"
148,THOMAS MOORE,"have been a duel at Chalk Farm, but for unloaded pistols and police"
149,THOMAS MOORE,interference. This _fiasco_ soon led to an amicable understanding between
150,THOMAS MOORE,"Moore and Jeffrey; and a few years later, about the end of 1811, to a"
151,THOMAS MOORE,friendship of closer intimacy between the Irish songster and his great
152,THOMAS MOORE,"poetic contemporary Lord Byron. His lordship, in his youthful satire of"
153,THOMAS MOORE,"_English Bards and Scotch Reviewers_, had made fun of the unbloody duel."
154,THOMAS MOORE,"This Moore resented, not so much as a mere matter of ridicule as because"
155,THOMAS MOORE,it involved an ignoring or a denial of a counter-statement of the matter
156,THOMAS MOORE,put into print by himself. He accordingly wrote a letter to Byron on the
157,THOMAS MOORE,"1st of January 1810, calculated to lead to further hostilities. But, as"
158,THOMAS MOORE,the noble poet had then already for some months left England for his
159,THOMAS MOORE,"prolonged tour on the Continent, the missive did not reach him; and a"
160,THOMAS MOORE,"little epistolary skirmishing, after his return in the following year,"
161,THOMAS MOORE,"terminated in a hearty reconciliation, and a very intimate cordiality,"
162,THOMAS MOORE,"almost deserving of the lofty name of friendship, on both sides."
163,THOMAS MOORE,
164,THOMAS MOORE,"Re-settled in London, and re-quartered upon the pleasant places of"
165,THOMAS MOORE,"fashion, Moore was once more a favorite at Holland House, Lansdowne House,"
166,THOMAS MOORE,"and Donington House, the residence of Lord Moira. His lordship obtained a"
167,THOMAS MOORE,"comfortable post to soothe the declining years of Moore's father, and held"
168,THOMAS MOORE,out to the poet himself the prospect--which was not however realized--of
169,THOMAS MOORE,another snug berth for his own occupancy. The United Kingdom of Great
170,THOMAS MOORE,Britain and Ireland never received the benefit of the Irish patriot's
171,THOMAS MOORE,services in any public capacity at home--only through the hands of a
172,THOMAS MOORE,"defaulting deputy in Bermuda: it did, however, at length give him the"
173,THOMAS MOORE,"money without the official money's-worth, for in 1835, under Lord"
174,THOMAS MOORE,"Melbourne's ministry, an annual literary pension of £300 was bestowed upon"
175,THOMAS MOORE,"the then elderly poet. Nor can it be said that Moore's worth to his party,"
176,THOMAS MOORE,"whether we regard him as political sharpshooter or as national lyrist,"
177,THOMAS MOORE,"deserved a less recognition from the Whigs: he had at one time, with"
178,THOMAS MOORE,"creditable independence, refused to be indebted to the Tories for an"
179,THOMAS MOORE,appointment. Some obloquy has at times been cast upon him on account of
180,THOMAS MOORE,"his sarcasms against the Prince Regent, which, however well merited on"
181,THOMAS MOORE,"public grounds, have been held to come with an ill grace from the man"
182,THOMAS MOORE,"whose first literary effort, the _Anacreon_, had been published under the"
183,THOMAS MOORE,"auspices of his Royal Highness as dedicatee, no doubt a practical"
184,THOMAS MOORE,"obligation of some moment to the writer. It does not appear, however, that"
185,THOMAS MOORE,the obligation went much beyond this simple acceptance of the dedication:
186,THOMAS MOORE,Moore himself declared that the Regent's further civilities had consisted
187,THOMAS MOORE,"simply in asking him twice to dinner, and admitting him, in 1811, to a"
188,THOMAS MOORE,fête in honor of the regency.
189,THOMAS MOORE,
190,THOMAS MOORE,The life of Moore for several years ensuing is one of literary success and
191,THOMAS MOORE,"social brilliancy, varied by his marrying in 1811, Miss Bessy Dyke, a lady"
192,THOMAS MOORE,"who made an excellent and devoted wife, and to whom he was very"
193,THOMAS MOORE,"affectionately attached, although the attractions and amenities of the"
194,THOMAS MOORE,fashionable world caused from time to time considerable inroads upon his
195,THOMAS MOORE,"domesticity. After a while, he removed from London, with his wife and"
196,THOMAS MOORE,"young family, to Mayfield Cottage, near Ashbourne, Derbyshire--a somewhat"
197,THOMAS MOORE,"lonely site. His _Irish Melodies_, the work by which he will continue best"
198,THOMAS MOORE,"known, had their origin in 1797, when his attention was drawn to a"
199,THOMAS MOORE,"publication named _Bunting's Irish Melodies_, for which he occasionally"
200,THOMAS MOORE,wrote the words. In 1807 he entered into a definite agreement with Mr.
201,THOMAS MOORE,"Power on this subject, in combination with Sir J. Stevenson, who undertook"
202,THOMAS MOORE,to compose the accompaniments. The work was prolonged up to the year 1834;
203,THOMAS MOORE,and contributed very materially to Moore's comfort in money matters and
204,THOMAS MOORE,his general prominence--as his own singing of the Melodies in good society
205,THOMAS MOORE,"kept up his sentimental and patriotic prestige, and his personal"
206,THOMAS MOORE,"lionizing, in a remarkable degree. He played on the piano, and sang with"
207,THOMAS MOORE,"taste, though in a style resembling recitative, and not with any great"
208,THOMAS MOORE,"power of voice: in speaking, his voice had a certain tendency to"
209,THOMAS MOORE,"hoarseness, but its quality became flute-like in singing. In 1811 he made"
210,THOMAS MOORE,"another essay in the musical province; writing, at the request of the"
211,THOMAS MOORE,"manager of the Lyceum Theatre, an operetta named _M.P., or the"
212,THOMAS MOORE,"Bluestocking_. It was the reverse of a stage-success; and Moore, in"
213,THOMAS MOORE,"collecting his poems, excluded this work, save as regards some of the"
214,THOMAS MOORE,"songs comprised in it. In 1808 had appeared anonymously, the poems of"
215,THOMAS MOORE,"_Intolerance and Corruption_, followed in 1809 by _The Sceptic_."
216,THOMAS MOORE,"_Intercepted Letters, or The Twopenny Postbag, by Thomas Brown the"
217,THOMAS MOORE,"Younger_, came out in 1812: it was a huge success, and very intelligibly"
218,THOMAS MOORE,"such, going through fourteen editions in one year. In the same year the"
219,THOMAS MOORE,project of writing an oriental poem--a class of work greatly in vogue now
220,THOMAS MOORE,that Byron was inventing Giaours and Corsairs--was seriously entertained
221,THOMAS MOORE,"by Moore. This project took shape in _Lalla Rookh_, written chiefly at"
222,THOMAS MOORE,Mayfield Cottage--a performance for which Mr. Longman the publisher paid
223,THOMAS MOORE,the extremely large sum of £3150 in advance: its publication hung over
224,THOMAS MOORE,"till 1817. The poem has been translated into all sorts of languages,"
225,THOMAS MOORE,"including Persian, and is said to have found many admirers among its"
226,THOMAS MOORE,oriental readers. Whatever may be thought of its poetic merits--and I for
227,THOMAS MOORE,one disclaim any scintilla of enthusiasm--or of its power in vitalizing
228,THOMAS MOORE,"the _disjecta membra_ of orientalism, the stock-in-trade of the Asiatic"
229,THOMAS MOORE,"curiosity-shop, there is no doubt that Moore worked very conscientiously"
230,THOMAS MOORE,"upon this undertaking: he read up to any extent,--wrote, talked, and"
231,THOMAS MOORE,"perhaps thought, Islamically--and he trips up his reader with some"
232,THOMAS MOORE,"allusion verse after verse, tumbling him to the bottom of the page, with"
233,THOMAS MOORE,its quagmire of explanatory footnotes. In 1815 appeared the _National
234,THOMAS MOORE,"Airs_; in 1816, _Sacred Songs, Duets, and Trios_, the music composed and"
235,THOMAS MOORE,"selected by Stevenson and Moore; in 1818, _The Fudge Family in Paris_,"
236,THOMAS MOORE,"again a great hit. This work was composed in Paris, which capital Moore"
237,THOMAS MOORE,had been visiting in company with his friend Samuel Rogers the poet.
238,THOMAS MOORE,
239,THOMAS MOORE,The easily earned money and easily discharged duties of the appointment in
240,THOMAS MOORE,"Bermuda began now to weigh heavy on Moore. Defalcations of his deputy, to"
241,THOMAS MOORE,"the extent of £6000, were discovered, for which the nominal holder of the"
242,THOMAS MOORE,"post was liable. Moore declined offers of assistance; and, pending a legal"
243,THOMAS MOORE,"decision on the matter, he had found it apposite to revisit the Continent."
244,THOMAS MOORE,"In France, Lord John (the late Earl) Russell was his travelling companion:"
245,THOMAS MOORE,"they went on together through Switzerland, and parted at Milan. Moore"
246,THOMAS MOORE,"then, on the 8th of October 1819, joined in Venice his friend Byron, who"
247,THOMAS MOORE,had been absent from England since 1816. The poets met in the best of
248,THOMAS MOORE,"humor, and on terms of hearty good-fellowship--Moore staying with Byron"
249,THOMAS MOORE,"for five or six days. On taking leave of him, Byron presented the Irish"
250,THOMAS MOORE,lyrist with the MS. of his autobiographical memoirs stipulating that they
251,THOMAS MOORE,should not be published till after the donor's death: at a later date he
252,THOMAS MOORE,became anxious that they should remain wholly unpublished. Moore sold the
253,THOMAS MOORE,"MS. in 1831 to Murray for £2100, after some negotiations with Longman, and"
254,THOMAS MOORE,consigned it to the publisher's hands. In 1824 the news arrived of Byron's
255,THOMAS MOORE,"death. Mr. (afterwards Sir Wilmot) Horton on the part of Lady Byron, Mr."
256,THOMAS MOORE,"Luttrell on that of Moore, Colonel Doyle on that of Mrs. Leigh, Lord"
257,THOMAS MOORE,"Byron's half-sister, and Mr. Hobhouse (afterwards Lord Broughton) as a"
258,THOMAS MOORE,"friend and executor of the deceased poet, consulted on the subject."
259,THOMAS MOORE,Hobhouse was strong in urging the suppression of the Memoirs. The result
260,THOMAS MOORE,"was that Murray, setting aside considerations of profit, burned the MS."
261,THOMAS MOORE,"(some principal portions of which nevertheless exist in print, in other"
262,THOMAS MOORE,"forms of publication); and Moore immediately afterwards, also in a"
263,THOMAS MOORE,"disinterested spirit, repaid him the purchase-money of £2100. It was quite"
264,THOMAS MOORE,fair that Moore should be reimbursed this large sum by some of the persons
265,THOMAS MOORE,"in whose behoof he had made the sacrifice, this was not neglected."
266,THOMAS MOORE,
267,THOMAS MOORE,"To resume. Bidding adieu to Byron at Venice, Moore went on to Rome with"
268,THOMAS MOORE,the sculptor Chantrey and the portrait-painter Jackson. His tour supplied
269,THOMAS MOORE,"the materials for the _Rhymes on the Road_, published, as being extracted"
270,THOMAS MOORE,"from the journal of a travelling member of the Pococurante Society, in"
271,THOMAS MOORE,"1820, along with the _Fables for the Holy Alliance_. Lawrence, Turner, and"
272,THOMAS MOORE,"Eastlake, were also much with Moore in Rome: and here he made acquaintance"
273,THOMAS MOORE,"with Canova. Hence he returned to Paris, and made that city his home up to"
274,THOMAS MOORE,"1822, expecting the outcome of the Bermuda affair. He also resided partly"
275,THOMAS MOORE,"at Butte Goaslin, near Sèvres, with a rich and hospitable Spanish family"
276,THOMAS MOORE,named Villamil. The debt of £6000 was eventually reduced to £750: both the
277,THOMAS MOORE,Marquis of Lansdowne and Lord John Russell pressed Moore with their
278,THOMAS MOORE,"friendly offers, and the advance which he at last accepted was soon repaid"
279,THOMAS MOORE,"out of the profits of the _Loves of the Angels_--which poem, chiefly"
280,THOMAS MOORE,"written in Paris, was published in 1823. The prose tale of _The Epicurean_"
281,THOMAS MOORE,"was composed about the same time, but did not issue from the press till"
282,THOMAS MOORE,1827: the _Memoirs of Captain Rock_ in 1824. He had been under an
283,THOMAS MOORE,engagement to a bookseller to write a _Life of Sheridan_. During his stay
284,THOMAS MOORE,in France the want of documents withheld him from proceeding with this
285,THOMAS MOORE,"work: but he ultimately took it up, and brought it out in 1825. It was not"
286,THOMAS MOORE,"availed to give Moore any reputation as a biographer, though the reader in"
287,THOMAS MOORE,search of amusement will pick out of it something to suit him. George the
288,THOMAS MOORE,Fourth is credited with having made a neat _bon mot_ upon this book. Some
289,THOMAS MOORE,"one having remarked to him that ""Moore had been murdering Sheridan,""--"
290,THOMAS MOORE,"""No,"" replied his sacred majesty, ""but he has certainly attempted his"
291,THOMAS MOORE,"life."" A later biographical performance, published in 1830, and one of"
292,THOMAS MOORE,"more enduring interest to posterity, was the _Life of Byron_. This is a"
293,THOMAS MOORE,very fascinating book; but more--which is indeed a matter of course--in
294,THOMAS MOORE,"virtue of the lavish amount of Byron's own writing which it embodies than,"
295,THOMAS MOORE,"on account of the Memoir-compiler's doings. However, there is a"
296,THOMAS MOORE,"considerable share of good feeling in the book, as well as matter of"
297,THOMAS MOORE,permanent value from the personal knowledge that Moore had of Byron; and
298,THOMAS MOORE,"the avoidance of ""posing"" and of dealing with the subject for purposes of"
299,THOMAS MOORE,"effect, in the case of a man whose career and genius lent themselves so"
300,THOMAS MOORE,"insidiously to such a treatment, is highly creditable to the biographer's"
301,THOMAS MOORE,"good sense and taste. The _Life of Byron_ succeeded, in the list of"
302,THOMAS MOORE,"Moore's writings, a _History of Ireland_, contributed in 1827 to"
303,THOMAS MOORE,"_Lardner's Cyclopaedia_, and the _Travels of an Irishman in Search of a"
304,THOMAS MOORE,"Religion_, published in the same year: and was followed by a _Life of Lord"
305,THOMAS MOORE,"Edward Fitzgerald_, issued in 1881. This, supplemented by some minor"
306,THOMAS MOORE,"productions, closes the sufficiently long list of writings of an"
307,THOMAS MOORE,industrious literary life.
308,THOMAS MOORE,
309,THOMAS MOORE,"In his latter years Moore resided at Sloperton Cottage, near Devizes in"
310,THOMAS MOORE,"Wiltshire, Where he was near the refined social circle of Lord Lansdowne"
311,THOMAS MOORE,"at Bowood, as well as the lettered home of the Rev. Mr. Bowles at"
312,THOMAS MOORE,Bremhill. Domestic sorrows clouded his otherwise cheerful and comfortable
313,THOMAS MOORE,retirement. One of his sons died in the French military service in
314,THOMAS MOORE,Algeria; another of consumption in 1842. For some years before his own
315,THOMAS MOORE,"death, which occurred on the 25th of February 1853, his mental powers had"
316,THOMAS MOORE,"collapsed. He sleeps in Bromham Cemetery, in the neighborhood of"
317,THOMAS MOORE,Sloperton.
318,THOMAS MOORE,
319,THOMAS MOORE,"Moore had a very fair share of learning, as well as steady application,"
320,THOMAS MOORE,"greatly as he sacrificed to the graces of life, and especially of ""good"
321,THOMAS MOORE,"society."" His face was not perhaps much more impressive in its contour"
322,THOMAS MOORE,"than his diminutive figure. His eyes, however, were dark and fine; his"
323,THOMAS MOORE,"forehead bony, and with what a phrenologist would recognize as large bumps"
324,THOMAS MOORE,"of wit; the mouth pleasingly dimpled. His manner and talk were bright,"
325,THOMAS MOORE,"abounding rather in lively anecdote and point than in wit and humor,"
326,THOMAS MOORE,"strictly so called. To term him amiable according to any standard, and"
327,THOMAS MOORE,"estimable too as men of an unheroic fibre go, is no more than his due."
328,THOMAS MOORE,
329,THOMAS MOORE,No doubt the world has already seen the most brilliant days of Moore's
330,THOMAS MOORE,poetry. Its fascinations are manifestly of the more temporary sort: partly
331,THOMAS MOORE,through fleetingness of subject-matter and evanescence of allusion (as in
332,THOMAS MOORE,the clever and still readable satirical poems); partly through the aroma
333,THOMAS MOORE,"of sentimental patriotism, hardly strong enough in stamina to make the"
334,THOMAS MOORE,"compositions national, or to maintain their high level of popularity after"
335,THOMAS MOORE,the lyrist himself has long been at rest; partly through the essentially
336,THOMAS MOORE,commonplace sources and forms of inspiration which belong to his more
337,THOMAS MOORE,elaborate and ambitious works. No poetical reader of the present day is
338,THOMAS MOORE,the poorer for knowing absolutely nothing of _Lalla Rookh_ or the _Loves
339,THOMAS MOORE,of the Angels_. What then will be the hold or the claim of these writings
340,THOMAS MOORE,upon a reader of the twenty-first century? If we expect the satirical
341,THOMAS MOORE,"compositions, choice in a different way, the best things of Moore are to"
342,THOMAS MOORE,"be sought in the _Irish Melodies_, to which a considerable share of merit,"
343,THOMAS MOORE,"and of apposite merit, is not to be denied: yet even here what deserts"
344,THOMAS MOORE,"around the oases, and the oases themselves how soon exhaustible and"
345,THOMAS MOORE,forgettable! There are but few thoroughly beautiful and touching lines in
346,THOMAS MOORE,the whole of Moore's poetry. Here is one--
347,THOMAS MOORE,
348,THOMAS MOORE,"""Come rest in this bosom, mine own stricken deer."""
349,THOMAS MOORE,
350,THOMAS MOORE,"A great deal has been said upon the overpowering ""lusciousness"" of his"
351,THOMAS MOORE,"poetry, and the magical ""melody"" of his verse: most of this is futile."
352,THOMAS MOORE,There is in the former as much of _fadeur_ as of lusciousness; and a
353,THOMAS MOORE,"certain tripping or trotting exactitude, not less fully reducible to the"
354,THOMAS MOORE,"test of scansion than of a well-attuned ear, is but a rudimentary form of"
355,THOMAS MOORE,melody--while of harmony or rhythmic volume of sound Moore is as
356,THOMAS MOORE,decisively destitute as any correct versifier can well be. No clearer
357,THOMAS MOORE,proof of the incapacity of the mass of critics and readers to appreciate
358,THOMAS MOORE,the calibre of poetical work in point of musical and general execution
359,THOMAS MOORE,"could be given than the fact that Moore has always with them passed, and"
360,THOMAS MOORE,"still passes, for an eminently melodious poet. What then remains? Chiefly"
361,THOMAS MOORE,"this. In one class of writing, liveliness of witty banter, along with"
362,THOMAS MOORE,"neatness; and, in the other and ostensibly more permanent class, elegance,"
363,THOMAS MOORE,"also along with neatness. Reduce these qualities to one denomination, and"
364,THOMAS MOORE,"we come to something that may be called ""Propriety"": a sufficiently"
365,THOMAS MOORE,"disastrous ""raw material"" for the purposes of a poet, and by no means"
366,THOMAS MOORE,loftily to be praised or admired even when regarded as the outer
367,THOMAS MOORE,investiture of a nobler poetic something within. But let desert of every
368,THOMAS MOORE,"kind have its place, and welcome. In the cosmical diapason and august"
369,THOMAS MOORE,"orchestra of poetry, Tom Moore's little Pan's-pipe can at odd moments be"
370,THOMAS MOORE,"heard, and interjects an appreciable and rightly-combined twiddle or two."
371,THOMAS MOORE,To be gratified with these at the instant is no more than the instrument
372,THOMAS MOORE,"justifies, and the executant claims: to think much about them when the"
373,THOMAS MOORE,organ is pealing or the violin plaining (with a Shelley performing on the
374,THOMAS MOORE,"first, or a Mrs. Browning on the second), or to be on the watch for their"
375,THOMAS MOORE,"recurrences, would be equally superfluous and weak-minded."

1358,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"There is but little known, with certainty of the life of Anacreon."
1359,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Chamaeleon Heracleotes, who wrote upon the subject, has been lost in the"
1360,REMARKS ON ANACREON,general wreck of ancient literature. The editors of the poet have
1361,REMARKS ON ANACREON,collected the few trifling anecdotes which are scattered through the
1362,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"extant authors of antiquity, and, supplying the deficiency of materials by"
1363,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"fictions of their own imagination, have arranged what they call a life of"
1364,REMARKS ON ANACREON,Anacreon. These specious fabrications are intended to indulge that
1365,REMARKS ON ANACREON,interest which we naturally feel in the biography of illustrious men; but
1366,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"it is rather a dangerous kind of illusion, as it confounds the limits of"
1367,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"history and romance, and is too often supported by unfaithful citation."
1368,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1369,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Our poet was born in the city of Teos, in the delicious region of Ionia,"
1370,REMARKS ON ANACREON,and the time of his birth appears to have been in the sixth century before
1371,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Christ. He flourished at that remarkable period when, under the polished"
1372,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"tyrants Hipparchus and Polycrates, Athens and Samos were become the rival"
1373,REMARKS ON ANACREON,asylums of genius. There is nothing certain known about his family; and
1374,REMARKS ON ANACREON,those who pretend to discover in Plato that he was a descendant of the
1375,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"monarch Codrus, show much more of zeal than of either accuracy or"
1376,REMARKS ON ANACREON,judgment.
1377,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1378,REMARKS ON ANACREON,The disposition and talents of Anacreon recommended him to the monarch of
1379,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Samos, and he was formed to be the friend of such a prince as Polycrates."
1380,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Susceptible only to the pleasures, he felt not the corruptions, of the"
1381,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"court; and while Pythagoras fled from the tyrant, Anacreon was celebrating"
1382,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"his praises oh the lyre. We are told, too, by Maximus Tyrius, that, by the"
1383,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"influence of his amatory songs, he softened the mind of Polycrates into a"
1384,REMARKS ON ANACREON,spirit of benevolence towards his subjects.
1385,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1386,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"The amours of the poet, and the rivalship of the tyrant, I shall pass"
1387,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"over in silence; and there are few, I presume, who will regret the"
1388,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"omission of most of those anecdotes, which the industry of some editors"
1389,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"has not only promulged, but discussed. Whatever is repugnant to modesty"
1390,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"and virtue is considered, in ethical science, by a supposition very"
1391,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"favorable to humanity, as impossible; and this amiable persuasion should"
1392,REMARKS ON ANACREON,be much more strongly entertained where the transgression wars with nature
1393,REMARKS ON ANACREON,as well as virtue. But why are we not allowed to indulge in the
1394,REMARKS ON ANACREON,presumption? Why are we officiously reminded that there have been really
1395,REMARKS ON ANACREON,such instances of depravity?
1396,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1397,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Hipparchus, who now maintained at Athens the power which his father"
1398,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Pisistratus had usurped, was one of those princes who may be said to have"
1399,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"polished the fetters of their subjects. He was the first, according to"
1400,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Plato, who edited the poems of Homer, and commanded them to be sung by the"
1401,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"rhapsodists at the celebration of the Panathenaea. From his court, which"
1402,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"was a sort of galaxy of genius, Anacreon could not long be absent."
1403,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Hipparchus sent a barge for him; the poet readily embraced the invitation,"
1404,REMARKS ON ANACREON,and the Muses and the Loves were wafted with him to Athens.
1405,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1406,REMARKS ON ANACREON,The manner of Anacreon's death was singular. We are told that in the
1407,REMARKS ON ANACREON,eighty-fifth year of his age he was choked by a grape-stone; and however
1408,REMARKS ON ANACREON,we may smile at their enthusiastic partiality who see in this easy and
1409,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"characteristic death a peculiar indulgence of Heaven, we cannot help"
1410,REMARKS ON ANACREON,admiring that his fate should have been so emblematic of his disposition.
1411,REMARKS ON ANACREON,Caelius Calcagninus alludes to this catastrophe in the following epitaph
1412,REMARKS ON ANACREON,on our poet:--
1413,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1414,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Those lips, then, hallowed sage, which poured along"
1415,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"A music sweet as any cygnet's song,"
1416,REMARKS ON ANACREON,The grape hath closed for ever!
1417,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Here let the ivy kiss the poet's tomb,"
1418,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Here let the rose he loved with laurels bloom,"
1419,REMARKS ON ANACREON,In bands that ne'er shall sever.
1420,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"But far be thou, oh! far, unholy vine,"
1421,REMARKS ON ANACREON,By whom the favorite minstrel of the Nine
1422,REMARKS ON ANACREON,Lost his sweet vital breath;
1423,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Thy God himself now blushes to confess,"
1424,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Once hallowed vine! he feels he loves thee less,"
1425,REMARKS ON ANACREON,Since poor Anacreon's death.
1426,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1427,REMARKS ON ANACREON,It has been supposed by some writers that Anacreon and Sappho were
1428,REMARKS ON ANACREON,contemporaries; and the very thought of an intercourse between persons so
1429,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"congenial, both in warmth of passion and delicacy of genius, gives such"
1430,REMARKS ON ANACREON,play to the imagination that the mind loves to indulge in it. But the
1431,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"vision dissolves before historical truth; and Chamaeleon, and Hermesianax,"
1432,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"who are the source of the supposition, are considered as having merely"
1433,REMARKS ON ANACREON,indulged in a poetical anachronism.
1434,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1435,REMARKS ON ANACREON,To infer the moral dispositions of a poet from the tone of sentiment
1436,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"which pervades his works, is sometimes a very fallacious analogy; but the"
1437,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"soul of Anacreon speaks so unequivocally through his odes, that we may"
1438,REMARKS ON ANACREON,safely consult them as the faithful mirrors of his heart. We find him
1439,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"there the elegant voluptuary, diffusing the seductive charm of sentiment"
1440,REMARKS ON ANACREON,over passions and propensities at which rigid morality must frown. His
1441,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"heart, devoted to indolence, seems to have thought that there is wealth"
1442,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"enough in happiness, but seldom happiness in mere wealth. The"
1443,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"cheerfulness, indeed, with which he brightens his old age is interesting"
1444,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"and endearing; like his own rose, he is fragrant even in decay. But the"
1445,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"most peculiar feature of his mind is that love of simplicity, which be"
1446,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"attributes to himself so feelingly, and which breathes characteristically"
1447,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"throughout all that he has sung. In truth, if we omit those few vices in"
1448,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"our estimate which religion, at that time, not only connived at, but"
1449,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"consecrated, we shall be inclined to say that the disposition of our poet"
1450,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"was amiable; that his morality was relaxed, but not abandoned; and that"
1451,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Virtue, with her zone loosened, may be an apt emblem of the character of"
1452,REMARKS ON ANACREON,Anacreon.
1453,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1454,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Of his person and physiognomy, time has preserved such uncertain"
1455,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"memorials, that it were better, perhaps, to leave the pencil to fancy; and"
1456,REMARKS ON ANACREON,few can read the Odes of Anacreon without imaging to themselves the form
1457,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"of the animated old bard, crowned with roses, and singing cheerfully to"
1458,REMARKS ON ANACREON,his lyre.
1459,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1460,REMARKS ON ANACREON,After the very enthusiastic eulogiums bestowed both by ancients and
1461,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"moderns upon the poems of Anacreon, we need not be diffident in expressing"
1462,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"our raptures at their beauty, nor hesitate to pronounce them the most"
1463,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"polished remains of antiquity. They are indeed, all beauty, all"
1464,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"enchantment. He steals us so insensibly along with him, that we sympathize"
1465,REMARKS ON ANACREON,even in his excesses. In his amatory odes there is a delicacy of
1466,REMARKS ON ANACREON,compliment not to be found in any other ancient poet. Love at that period
1467,REMARKS ON ANACREON,was rather an unrefined emotion; and the intercourse of the sexes was
1468,REMARKS ON ANACREON,animated more by passion than by sentiment. They knew not those little
1469,REMARKS ON ANACREON,tendernesses which form the spiritual part of affection; their expression
1470,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"of feeling was therefore rude and unvaried, and the poetry of love"
1471,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"deprived it of its most captivating graces. Anacreon, however, attained"
1472,REMARKS ON ANACREON,some ideas of this purer gallantry; and the same delicacy of mind which
1473,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"led him to this refinement, prevented him also from yielding to the"
1474,REMARKS ON ANACREON,freedom of language which has sullied the pages of all the other poets.
1475,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"His descriptions are warm; but the warmth is in the ideas, not the words."
1476,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"He is sportive without being wanton, and ardent without being licentious."
1477,REMARKS ON ANACREON,His poetic invention is always most brilliantly displayed in those
1478,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"allegorical fictions which so many have endeavored to imitate, though all"
1479,REMARKS ON ANACREON,have confessed them to be inimitable. Simplicity is the distinguishing
1480,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"feature of these odes, and they interest by their innocence, as much as"
1481,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"they fascinate by their beauty. They may be said, indeed, to be the very"
1482,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"infants of the Muses, and to lisp in numbers."
1483,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1484,REMARKS ON ANACREON,I shall not be accused of enthusiastic partiality by those who have read
1485,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"and felt the original; but to others, I am conscious, this should not be"
1486,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"the language of a translator, whose faint reflection of such beauties can"
1487,REMARKS ON ANACREON,but ill justify his admiration of them.
1488,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1489,REMARKS ON ANACREON,In the age of Anacreon music and poetry were inseparable. These kindred
1490,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"talents were for a long time associated, and the poet always sung his own"
1491,REMARKS ON ANACREON,compositions to the lyre. It is probable that they were not set to any
1492,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"regular air, but rather a kind of musical recitation, which was varied"
1493,REMARKS ON ANACREON,according to the fancy and feelings of the moment. The poems of Anacreon
1494,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"were sung at banquets as late as the time of Aulus Gellius, who tells us"
1495,REMARKS ON ANACREON,that he heard one of the odes performed at a birthday entertainment.
1496,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1497,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"The singular beauty of our poet's style and the apparent facility,"
1498,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"perhaps, of his metre have attracted, as I have already remarked, a crowd"
1499,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"of imitators. Some of these have succeeded with wonderful felicity, as may"
1500,REMARKS ON ANACREON,be discerned in the few odes which are attributed to writers of a later
1501,REMARKS ON ANACREON,period. But none of his emulators have been half so dangerous to his fame
1502,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"as those Greek ecclesiastics of the early ages, who, being conscious of"
1503,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"their own inferiority to their great prototypes, determined on removing"
1504,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"all possibility of comparison, and, under a semblance of moral zeal,"
1505,REMARKS ON ANACREON,deprived the world of some of the most exquisite treasures of ancient
1506,REMARKS ON ANACREON,times. The works of Sappho and Alcaeus were among those flowers of Grecian
1507,REMARKS ON ANACREON,literature which thus fell beneath the rude hand of ecclesiastical
1508,REMARKS ON ANACREON,presumption. It is true they pretended that this sacrifice of genius was
1509,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"hallowed by the interests of religion, but I have already assigned the"
1510,REMARKS ON ANACREON,most probable motive; and if Gregorius Nazianzenus had not written
1511,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Anacreontics, we might now perhaps have the works of the Teian"
1512,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"unmutilated, and be empowered to say exultingly with Horace,"
1513,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1514,REMARKS ON ANACREON,_Nec si quid olim lusit Anacreon
1515,REMARKS ON ANACREON,delevit aetas_.
1516,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1517,REMARKS ON ANACREON,The zeal by which these bishops professed to be actuated gave birth more
1518,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"innocently, indeed, to an absurd species of parody, as repugnant to piety"
1519,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"as it is to taste, where the poet of voluptuousness was made a preacher of"
1520,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"the gospel, and his muse, like the Venus in armor at Lacedaemon, was"
1521,REMARKS ON ANACREON,arrayed in all the severities of priestly instruction. Such was the
1522,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"""Anacreon Recantatus,"" by Carolus de Aquino, a Jesuit, published 1701,"
1523,REMARKS ON ANACREON,which consisted of a series of palinodes to the several songs of our poet.
1524,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Such, too, was the Christian Anacreon of Patrignanus, another Jesuit, who"
1525,REMARKS ON ANACREON,preposterously transferred to a most sacred subject all that the Graecian
1526,REMARKS ON ANACREON,poet had dedicated to festivity and love.
1527,REMARKS ON ANACREON,
1528,REMARKS ON ANACREON,His metre has frequently been adopted by the modern Latin poets; and
1529,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"Scaliger, Taubman, Barthius, and others, have shown that it is by no means"
1530,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"uncongenial with that language. The Anacreontics of Scaliger, however,"
1531,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"scarcely deserve the name; as they glitter all over with conceits, and,"
1532,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"though often elegant, are always labored. The beautiful fictions of"
1533,REMARKS ON ANACREON,Angerianus preserve more happily than any others the delicate turn of
1534,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"those allegorical fables, which, passing so frequently through the mediums"
1535,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"of version and imitation, have generally lost their finest rays in the"
1536,REMARKS ON ANACREON,transmission. Many of the Italian poets have indulged their fancies upon
1537,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"the subjects; and in the manner of Anacreon, Bernardo Tasso first"
1538,REMARKS ON ANACREON,"introduced the metre, which was afterwards polished and enriched by"
1539,REMARKS ON ANACREON,Chabriera and others.

3241,ODE XLIII.,"quarter-tones, which we are told was the nature of the enharmonic scale,"
3242,ODE XLIII.,simplicity was by no means the characteristic of their melody; for this is

3787,ODE LVI.,"charm, infused by Helen into the wine of her guests, which had the power"
3788,ODE LVI.,"of dispelling every anxiety. A French writer, De Mere, conjectures that"
3789,ODE LVI.,"this spell, which made the bowl so beguiling, was the charm of Helen's"

3840,ODE LVII[1],[1] This ode is a very animated description of a picture of Venus on a
3841,ODE LVII[1],"discus, which represented the goddess in her first emergence from the"
3842,ODE LVII[1],"waves. About two centuries after our poet wrote, the pencil of the artist"
3843,ODE LVII[1],"Apelles embellished this subject, in his famous painting of the Venus"
3844,ODE LVII[1],"Anadyomene, the model of which, as Pliny informs us, was the beautiful"
3845,ODE LVII[1],"Campaspe, given to him by Alexander; though, according to Natalis Comes,"
3846,ODE LVII[1],"lib. vii. cap. 16., it was Phryne who sat to Apelles for the face and"
3847,ODE LVII[1],breast of this Venus.
3848,ODE LVII[1],
3849,ODE LVII[1],[2] The picture here has all the delicate character of the semi-reducta
3850,ODE LVII[1],"Venus, and affords a happy specimen of what the poetry of passion"
3851,ODE LVII[1],"_ought_ to be--glowing but through a veil, and stealing upon the heart"
3852,ODE LVII[1],from concealment. Few of the ancients have attained this modesty of
3853,ODE LVII[1],"description, which, like the golden cloud that hung over Jupiter and Juno,"
3854,ODE LVII[1],is impervious to every beam but that of fancy.

3868,ODE LVIII.,"No, let the false deserter go,"

3893,ODE LVIII.,"Thy wings can waft, thy mines can hold."

3895,ODE LVIII.,They withered Love's young wreathèd smiles;
3896,ODE LVIII.,"And o'er his lyre such darkness shed,"
3897,ODE LVIII.,I thought its soul of song was fled!
3898,ODE LVIII.,"They dashed the wine-cup, that, by him,"
3899,ODE LVIII.,Was filled with kisses to the brim.[3]
3900,ODE LVIII.,"Go--fly to haunts of sordid men,"
3901,ODE LVIII.,But come not near the bard again.
3902,ODE LVIII.,"Thy glitter in the Muse's shade,"
3903,ODE LVIII.,Scares from her bower the tuneful maid;
3904,ODE LVIII.,And not for worlds would I forego
3905,ODE LVIII.,"That moment of poetic glow,"
3906,ODE LVIII.,"When my full soul, in Fancy's stream,"
3907,ODE LVIII.,"Pours o'er the lyre, its swelling theme."

3909,ODE LVIII.,Who feel not this diviner sense;
3910,ODE LVIII.,"Give gold to those who love that pest,--"
3911,ODE LVIII.,But leave the poet poor and blest.

3913,ODE LVIII.,
3914,ODE LVIII.,"[1] There is a kind of pun in these words, as Madame Dacier has already"
3915,ODE LVIII.,"remarked; for Chrysos, which signifies gold, was also a frequent name for"
3916,ODE LVIII.,"a slave. In one of Lucian's dialogues, there is, I think, a similar play"
3917,ODE LVIII.,"upon the word, where the followers of Chrysippus are called golden fishes."
3918,ODE LVIII.,"The puns of the ancients are, in general, even more vapid than our own;"
3919,ODE LVIII.,some of the best are those recorded of Diogenes.
3920,ODE LVIII.,
3921,ODE LVIII.,[2] This grace of iteration has already been taken notice of. Though
3922,ODE LVIII.,"sometimes merely a playful beauty, it is peculiarly expressive of"
3923,ODE LVIII.,"impassioned sentiment, and we may easily believe that it was one of the"
3924,ODE LVIII.,many sources of that energetic sensibility which breathed through the
3925,ODE LVIII.,style of Sappho.

3929,ODE LVIII.,"kisses"" our poet may allude to a favorite gallantry among the ancients, of"
3930,ODE LVIII.,drinking when the lips of their mistresses had touched the brim;--
3931,ODE LVIII.,
3932,ODE LVIII.,"""Or leave a kiss within the cup And I'll not ask for wine."""

4174,ODE LXIV.[1],"our poet, which has led some to doubt whether he ever wrote any odes of"
4175,ODE LXIV.[1],this kind. It is related by the Scholiast upon Pindar (Isthmionic. od. ii.
4176,ODE LXIV.[1],v. 1. as cited by Barnes) that Anaecreon being asked why he addressed all
4177,ODE LXIV.[1],"his hymns to women, and none to the deities? answered, ""Because women are"
4178,ODE LXIV.[1],"my deities."""
4179,ODE LXIV.[1],
4180,ODE LXIV.[1],"I have assumed, it will be seen, in reporting this anecdote, the same"
4181,ODE LXIV.[1],liberty which I have thought it right to take in translating some of the

4183,ODE LXIV.[1],allowable in interpreting the writings of the ancients.

5270,A TALE OF ROMANCE.,

5274,A TALE OF ROMANCE.,And saw but the foam of the white billow there.
5275,A TALE OF ROMANCE.,
5276,A TALE OF ROMANCE.,"And often as midnight its veil would undraw,"
5277,A TALE OF ROMANCE.,"As she looked at the light of the moon in the stream,"

5279,A TALE OF ROMANCE.,As the curl of the surge glittered high in the beam.
5280,A TALE OF ROMANCE.,
5281,A TALE OF ROMANCE.,And now the third night was begemming the sky;
5282,A TALE OF ROMANCE.,"Poor Rose, on the cold dewy margent reclined,"

7495,A TALE,
7496,A TALE,The happy day at length arrived
7497,A TALE,When Rupert was to wed
7498,A TALE,"The fairest maid in Saxony,"
7499,A TALE,And take her to his bed.
7500,A TALE,
7501,A TALE,"As soon as morn was in the sky,"
7502,A TALE,The feast and sports began;
7503,A TALE,"The men admired the happy maid,"
7504,A TALE,The maids the happy man.
7505,A TALE,
7506,A TALE,In many a sweet device of mirth
7507,A TALE,The day was past along;
7508,A TALE,"And some the featly dance amused,"
7509,A TALE,And some the dulcet song.
7510,A TALE,
7511,A TALE,The younger maids with Isabel
7512,A TALE,"Disported through the bowers,"
7513,A TALE,"And decked her robe, and crowned her head"
7514,A TALE,With motley bridal flowers.
7515,A TALE,
7516,A TALE,"The matrons all in rich attire,"
7517,A TALE,"Within the castle walls,"
7518,A TALE,Sat listening to the choral strains
7519,A TALE,"That echoed, through the halls."
7520,A TALE,
7521,A TALE,Young Rupert and his friends repaired
7522,A TALE,"Unto a spacious court,"
7523,A TALE,To strike the bounding tennis-ball
7524,A TALE,In feat and manly sport.
7525,A TALE,
7526,A TALE,The bridegroom on his finger wore
7527,A TALE,"The wedding-ring so bright,"
7528,A TALE,Which was to grace the lily hand
7529,A TALE,Of Isabel that night.
7530,A TALE,
7531,A TALE,"And fearing he might break the gem,"
7532,A TALE,"Or lose it in the play,"
7533,A TALE,"Hie looked around the court, to see"
7534,A TALE,Where he the ring might lay.
7535,A TALE,
7536,A TALE,"Now, in the court a statue stood,"
7537,A TALE,Which there full long had been;
7538,A TALE,"It might a Heathen goddess be,"
7539,A TALE,"Or else, a Heathen queen."
7540,A TALE,
7541,A TALE,Upon its marble finger then
7542,A TALE,He tried the ring to fit;
7543,A TALE,"And, thinking it was safest there,"
7544,A TALE,Thereon he fastened it.
7545,A TALE,
7546,A TALE,"And now the tennis sports went on,"
7547,A TALE,"Till they were wearied all,"
7548,A TALE,And messengers announced to them
7549,A TALE,"Their dinner in the hall,"
7550,A TALE,
7551,A TALE,Young Rupert for his wedding-ring
7552,A TALE,Unto the statue went;
7553,A TALE,"But, oh, how shocked was he to find"
7554,A TALE,The marble finger bent!
7555,A TALE,
7556,A TALE,The hand was closed upon the ring
7557,A TALE,With firm and mighty clasp;
7558,A TALE,"In vain he tried and tried and tried,"
7559,A TALE,He could not loose the grasp!
7560,A TALE,
7561,A TALE,Then sore surprised was Rupert's mind--
7562,A TALE,As well his mind might be;
7563,A TALE,"""I'll come,"" quoth he, ""at night again,"
7564,A TALE,"""When none are here to see."""
7565,A TALE,
7566,A TALE,"He went unto the feast, and much"
7567,A TALE,He thought upon his ring;
7568,A TALE,And marvelled sorely what could mean
7569,A TALE,So very strange a thing!
7570,A TALE,
7571,A TALE,"The feast was o'er, and to the court"
7572,A TALE,"He hied without delay,"
7573,A TALE,Resolved to break the marble hand
7574,A TALE,And force the ring away.
7575,A TALE,
7576,A TALE,"But, mark a stranger wonder still--"
7577,A TALE,The ring was there no more
7578,A TALE,"And yet the marble hand ungrasped,"
7579,A TALE,And open as before!
7580,A TALE,
7581,A TALE,"He searched the base, and all the court,"
7582,A TALE,But nothing could he find;
7583,A TALE,Then to the castle hied he back
7584,A TALE,With sore bewildered mind.
7585,A TALE,
7586,A TALE,"Within he found them all in mirth,"
7587,A TALE,The night in dancing flew:
7588,A TALE,"The youth another ring procured,"
7589,A TALE,And none the adventure knew.
7590,A TALE,
7591,A TALE,"And now the priest has joined their hands,"
7592,A TALE,The hours of love advance:
7593,A TALE,Rupert almost forgets to think
7594,A TALE,Upon the morn's mischance.
7595,A TALE,
7596,A TALE,Within the bed fair Isabel
7597,A TALE,"In blushing sweetness lay,"
7598,A TALE,"Like flowers, half-opened by the"
7599,A TALE,"dawn,"
7600,A TALE,And waiting for the day.
7601,A TALE,
7602,A TALE,"And Rupert, by her lovely side,"
7603,A TALE,"In youthful beauty glows,"
7604,A TALE,"Like Phoebus, when he bends to cast"
7605,A TALE,His beams upon a rose.
7606,A TALE,
7607,A TALE,"And here my song would leave them both,"
7608,A TALE,"Nor let the rest be told,"
7609,A TALE,If 'twere not for the horrid tale
7610,A TALE,It yet has to unfold.
7611,A TALE,
7612,A TALE,"Soon Rupert, 'twixt his bride and him"
7613,A TALE,A death cold carcass found;
7614,A TALE,"He saw it not, but thought he felt"
7615,A TALE,Its arms embrace him round.
7616,A TALE,
7617,A TALE,"He started up, and then returned,"
7618,A TALE,But found the phantom still;
7619,A TALE,"In vain he shrunk, it clipt him"
7620,A TALE,"round,"
7621,A TALE,With damp and deadly chill!
7622,A TALE,
7623,A TALE,"And when he bent, the earthy lips"
7624,A TALE,A kiss of horror gave;
7625,A TALE,"'Twas like the smell from charnel vaults,"
7626,A TALE,Or from the mouldering grave!
7627,A TALE,
7628,A TALE,Ill-fated Rupert!--wild and loud
7629,A TALE,"Then cried he to his wife,"
7630,A TALE,"""Oh! save me from this horrid fiend,"
7631,A TALE,"""My Isabel! my life!"""
7632,A TALE,
7633,A TALE,"But Isabel had nothing seen,"
7634,A TALE,She looked around in vain;
7635,A TALE,And much she mourned the mad conceit
7636,A TALE,That racked her Rupert's brain.
7637,A TALE,
7638,A TALE,At length from this invisible
7639,A TALE,These words to Rupert came:
7640,A TALE,(Oh God! while he did hear the words
7641,A TALE,What terrors shook his frame!)
7642,A TALE,
7643,A TALE,"""Husband, husband, I've the ring"
7644,A TALE,"""Thou gavest to-day to me;"
7645,A TALE,"""And thou'rt to me for ever wed,"
7646,A TALE,"""As I am wed to thee!"""
7647,A TALE,
7648,A TALE,And all the night the demon lay
7649,A TALE,"Cold-chilling by his side,"
7650,A TALE,"And strained him with such deadly grasp,"
7651,A TALE,He thought he should have died.
7652,A TALE,
7653,A TALE,"But when the dawn of day was near,"
7654,A TALE,"The horrid phantom fled,"
7655,A TALE,And left the affrighted youth to weep
7656,A TALE,By Isabel in bed.
7657,A TALE,
7658,A TALE,And all that day a gloomy cloud
7659,A TALE,Was seen on Rupert's brows;
7660,A TALE,"Fair Isabel was likewise sad,"
7661,A TALE,But strove to cheer her spouse.
7662,A TALE,
7663,A TALE,"And, as the day advanced, he thought"
7664,A TALE,Of coming night with fear:
7665,A TALE,"Alas, that he should dread to view"
7666,A TALE,The bed that should be dear!
7667,A TALE,
7668,A TALE,"At length the second night arrived,"
7669,A TALE,Again their couch they prest;
7670,A TALE,"Poor Rupert hoped that all was o'er,"
7671,A TALE,And looked for love and rest.
7672,A TALE,
7673,A TALE,"But oh! when midnight came, again"
7674,A TALE,"The fiend was at his side,"
7675,A TALE,"And, as it strained him in its grasp,"
7676,A TALE,With howl exulting cried:--
7677,A TALE,
7678,A TALE,"""Husband, husband, I've the ring,"
7679,A TALE,"""The ring thou gavest to me;"
7680,A TALE,"""And thou'rt to me for ever wed,"
7681,A TALE,"""As I am wed to thee!"","
7682,A TALE,
7683,A TALE,"In agony of wild despair,"
7684,A TALE,He started from the bed;
7685,A TALE,And thus to his bewildered wife
7686,A TALE,The trembling Rupert said;
7687,A TALE,
7688,A TALE,"""Oh Isabel! dost thou not see"
7689,A TALE,"""A shape of horrors here,"
7690,A TALE,"""That strains me to its deadly kiss,"
7691,A TALE,"""And keeps me from my dear?"""
7692,A TALE,
7693,A TALE,"""No, no, my love! my Rupert, I"
7694,A TALE,"""No shape of horrors see;"
7695,A TALE,"""And much I mourn the fantasy"
7696,A TALE,"""That keeps my dear from me."""
7697,A TALE,
7698,A TALE,"This night, just like the night before,"
7699,A TALE,In terrors past away.
7700,A TALE,Nor did the demon vanish thence
7701,A TALE,Before the dawn of day.
7702,A TALE,
7703,A TALE,"Said Rupert then, ""My Isabel,"
7704,A TALE,"""Dear partner of my woe."
7705,A TALE,"""To Father Austin's holy cave"
7706,A TALE,"""This instant will I go."""
7707,A TALE,
7708,A TALE,"Now Austin was a reverend man,"
7709,A TALE,Who acted wonders maint--
7710,A TALE,Whom all the country round believed
7711,A TALE,A devil or a saint!
7712,A TALE,
7713,A TALE,To Father Austin's holy cave
7714,A TALE,Then Rupert straightway went;
7715,A TALE,"And told him all, and asked him how"
7716,A TALE,These horrors to prevent.
7717,A TALE,
7718,A TALE,"The father heard the youth, and then"
7719,A TALE,Retired awhile to pray:
7720,A TALE,"And, having prayed for half an hour"
7721,A TALE,Thus to the youth did say:
7722,A TALE,
7723,A TALE,"""There is a place where four roads meet,"
7724,A TALE,"""Which I will tell to thee;"
7725,A TALE,"""Be there this eve, at fall of night,"
7726,A TALE,"""And list what thou shalt see."
7727,A TALE,
7728,A TALE,"""Thou'lt see a group of figures pass"
7729,A TALE,"""In strange disordered crowd,"
7730,A TALE,"""Travelling by torchlight through the roads,"
7731,A TALE,"""With noises strange and loud."
7732,A TALE,
7733,A TALE,"""And one that's high above the rest,"
7734,A TALE,"""Terrific towering o'er,"
7735,A TALE,"""Will make thee know him at a glance,"
7736,A TALE,"""So I need say no more."
7737,A TALE,
7738,A TALE,"""To him from me these tablets give,"
7739,A TALE,"""They'll quick be understood;"
7740,A TALE,"""Thou need'st not fear, but give them straight,"
7741,A TALE,"""I've scrawled them with my blood!"""
7742,A TALE,
7743,A TALE,"The night-fall came, and Rupert all"
7744,A TALE,In pale amazement went
7745,A TALE,"To where the cross-roads met, as he"
7746,A TALE,Was by the Father sent.
7747,A TALE,
7748,A TALE,And lo! a group of figures came
7749,A TALE,In strange disordered crowd.
7750,A TALE,"Travelling by torchlight through the roads,"
7751,A TALE,With noises strange and loud.
7752,A TALE,
7753,A TALE,"And, as the gloomy train advanced,"
7754,A TALE,Rupert beheld from far
7755,A TALE,A female form of wanton mien
7756,A TALE,High seated on a car.
7757,A TALE,
7758,A TALE,"And Rupert, as he gazed upon"
7759,A TALE,"The loosely-vested dame,"
7760,A TALE,"Thought of the marble statue's look,"
7761,A TALE,For hers was just the same.
7762,A TALE,
7763,A TALE,"Behind her walked a hideous form,"
7764,A TALE,With eyeballs flashing death;
7765,A TALE,"Whene'er he breathed, a sulphured smoke"
7766,A TALE,Came burning in his breath.
7767,A TALE,
7768,A TALE,"He seemed the first of all the crowd,"
7769,A TALE,Terrific towering o'er;
7770,A TALE,"""Yes, yes,"" said Rupert, ""this is he,"
7771,A TALE,"""And I need ask no more."""
7772,A TALE,
7773,A TALE,"Then slow he went, and to this fiend"
7774,A TALE,"The tablets trembling gave,"
7775,A TALE,Who looked and read them with a yell
7776,A TALE,That would disturb the grave.
7777,A TALE,
7778,A TALE,"And when he saw the blood-scrawled name,"
7779,A TALE,His eyes with fury shine;
7780,A TALE,"""I thought,"" cries he, ""his time was out,"
7781,A TALE,"""But he must soon be mine!"""
7782,A TALE,
7783,A TALE,Then darting at the youth a look
7784,A TALE,"Which rent his soul with fear,"
7785,A TALE,"He went unto the female fiend,"
7786,A TALE,And whispered in her ear.
7787,A TALE,
7788,A TALE,The female fiend no sooner heard
7789,A TALE,"Than, with reluctant look,"
7790,A TALE,"The very ring that Rupert lost,"
7791,A TALE,She from her finger took.
7792,A TALE,
7793,A TALE,"And, giving it unto the youth,"
7794,A TALE,"With eyes that breathed of hell,"
7795,A TALE,"She said, in that tremendous voice,"
7796,A TALE,Which he remembered well:
7797,A TALE,
7798,A TALE,"""In Austin's name take back the ring,"
7799,A TALE,"""The ring thou gavest to me;"
7800,A TALE,"""And thou'rt to me no longer wed,"
7801,A TALE,"""Nor longer I to thee."""
7802,A TALE,
7803,A TALE,"He took the ring, the rabble past."
7804,A TALE,He home returned again;
7805,A TALE,"His wife was then the happiest fair,"
7806,A TALE,The happiest he of men.
7807,A TALE,
7808,A TALE,
7809,A TALE,[1] I should be sorry to think that my friend had any serious intentions
7810,A TALE,of frightening the nursery by this story; I rather hope--though the manner
7811,A TALE,of it leads me to doubt--that his design was to ridicule that distempered
7812,A TALE,"taste which prefers those monsters of the fancy to the _""speciosa"
7813,A TALE,"miracula""_ of true poetic imagination."

9015,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,
9016,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"'Twas played on by the gentlest sighs,"
9017,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,And to their breath it breathed again

9019,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,As ear had never drunk till then!
9020,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,
9021,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,Not harmony's serenest touch
9022,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,So stilly could the notes prolong;
9023,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,They were not heavenly song so much
9024,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,As they were dreams of heavenly song!
9025,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,
9026,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"If sad the heart, whose murmuring air"
9027,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"Along the chords in languor stole,"
9028,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,The numbers it awakened there
9029,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,Were eloquence from pity's soul.
9030,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,
9031,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"Or if the sigh, serene and light,"
9032,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"Was but the breath of fancied woes,"
9033,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"The string, that felt its airy flight,"
9034,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,Soon whispered it to kind repose.
9035,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,

9045,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,
9046,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"'Twas there, at twilight time, she stole,"
9047,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"When the first star announced the night,--"
9048,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"With him who claimed her inmost soul,"
9049,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,To wander by that soothing light.
9050,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,
9051,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"It chanced that, in the fairy bower"
9052,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"Where blest they wooed each other's smile,"
9053,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"This Lyre, of strange and magic power,"
9054,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,Hung whispering o'er their head the while.
9055,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,
9056,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"And as, with eyes commingling fire,"
9057,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"They listened to each other's vow,"
9058,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,The youth full oft would make the Lyre
9059,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,A pillow for the maiden's brow!
9060,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,
9061,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"And, while the melting words she breathed"
9062,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"Were by its echoes wafted round,"
9063,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"Her locks had with the chords so wreathed,"
9064,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,One knew not which gave forth the sound.
9065,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,
9066,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"Alas, their hearts but little thought,"
9067,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"While thus they talked the hours away,"
9068,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,That every sound the Lyre was taught
9069,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"Would linger long, and long betray."
9070,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,
9071,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,So mingled with its tuneful soul
9072,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"Were all the tender murmurs grown,"
9073,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"That other sighs unanswered stole,"
9074,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,Nor words it breathed but theirs alone.
9075,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,
9076,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,Unhappy nymph! thy name was sung
9077,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,To every breeze that wandered by;
9078,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,The secrets of thy gentle tongue
9079,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,Were breathed in song to earth and sky.

9084,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,Proclaimed the mystery of your loves.
9085,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,
9086,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,Nor long thus rudely was thy name
9087,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,To earth's derisive echoes given;
9088,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,Some pitying spirit downward came.
9089,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,And took the Lyre and thee to heaven.
9090,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,
9091,THE TELL-TALE LYRE.,"There, freed from earth's unholy wrongs,"

10680,PREFACE.[1],
10681,PREFACE.[1],
10682,PREFACE.[1],The principal poems in the following collection were written during an
10683,PREFACE.[1],absence of fourteen months from Europe. Though curiosity was certainly not
10684,PREFACE.[1],"the motive of my voyage to America, yet it happened that the gratification"
10685,PREFACE.[1],of curiosity was the only advantage which I derived from it. Finding
10686,PREFACE.[1],"myself in the country of a new people, whose infancy had promised so much,"
10687,PREFACE.[1],and whose progress to maturity has been an object of such interesting
10688,PREFACE.[1],"speculation, I determined to employ the short period of time, which my"
10689,PREFACE.[1],"plan of return to Europe afforded me, in travelling through a few of the"
10690,PREFACE.[1],"States, and acquiring some knowledge of the inhabitants."
10691,PREFACE.[1],
10692,PREFACE.[1],The impression which my mind received from the character and manners of
10693,PREFACE.[1],"these republicans, suggested the Epistles which are written from the city"
10694,PREFACE.[1],of Washington and Lake Erie.[2] How far I was right in thus assuming the
10695,PREFACE.[1],tone of a satirist against a people whom I viewed but as a stranger and a
10696,PREFACE.[1],"visitor, is a doubt which my feelings did not allow me time to"
10697,PREFACE.[1],investigate. All I presume to answer for is the fidelity of the picture
10698,PREFACE.[1],which I have given; and though prudence might have dictated gentler
10699,PREFACE.[1],"language, truth, I think, would have justified severer."
10700,PREFACE.[1],
10701,PREFACE.[1],"I went to America with prepossessions by no means unfavorable, and indeed"
10702,PREFACE.[1],"rather indulged in many of those illusive ideas, with respect to the"
10703,PREFACE.[1],"purity of the government and the primitive happiness of the people, which"
10704,PREFACE.[1],"I had early imbibed In my native country, where, unfortunately, discontent"
10705,PREFACE.[1],"at home enhances every distant temptation, and the western world has long"
10706,PREFACE.[1],"been looked to as a retreat from real or imaginary oppression; as, in"
10707,PREFACE.[1],"short, the elysian Atlantis, where persecuted patriots might find their"
10708,PREFACE.[1],"visions realized, and be welcomed by kindred spirits to liberty and"
10709,PREFACE.[1],repose. In all these flattering expectations I found myself completely
10710,PREFACE.[1],"disappointed, and felt inclined to say to America, as Horace says to his"
10711,PREFACE.[1],"mistress, ""_intentata nites_."" Brissot, in the preface to his travels,"
10712,PREFACE.[1],"observes, that ""freedom in that country is carried to so high a degree as"
10713,PREFACE.[1],"to border upon a state of nature;"" and there certainly is a close"
10714,PREFACE.[1],"approximation to savage life not only in the liberty which they enjoy, but"
10715,PREFACE.[1],in the violence of party spirit and of private animosity which results
10716,PREFACE.[1],"from it. This illiberal zeal imbitters all social intercourse; and, though"
10717,PREFACE.[1],"I scarcely could hesitate in selecting the party, whose views appeared to"
10718,PREFACE.[1],"me the more pure and rational, yet I was sorry to observe that, in"
10719,PREFACE.[1],"asserting their opinions, they both assume an equal share of intolerance;"
10720,PREFACE.[1],"the Democrats consistently with their principles, exhibiting a vulgarity"
10721,PREFACE.[1],"of rancor, which the Federalists too often are so forgetful of their cause"
10722,PREFACE.[1],as to imitate.
10723,PREFACE.[1],
10724,PREFACE.[1],"The rude familiarity of the lower orders, and indeed the unpolished state"
10725,PREFACE.[1],"of society in general, would neither surprise nor disgust if they seemed"
10726,PREFACE.[1],"to flow from that simplicity of character, that honest ignorance of the"
10727,PREFACE.[1],gloss of refinement which may be looked for in a new and inexperienced
10728,PREFACE.[1],"people. But, when we find them arrived at maturity in most of the vices,"
10729,PREFACE.[1],"and all the pride of civilization, while they are still so far removed"
10730,PREFACE.[1],"from its higher and better characteristics, it is impossible not to feel"
10731,PREFACE.[1],"that this youthful decay, this crude anticipation of the natural period of"
10732,PREFACE.[1],"corruption, must repress every sanguine hope of the future energy and"
10733,PREFACE.[1],greatness of America.
10734,PREFACE.[1],
10735,PREFACE.[1],"I am conscious that, in venturing these few remarks, I have said just"
10736,PREFACE.[1],"enough to offend, and by no means sufficient to convince; for the limits"
10737,PREFACE.[1],"of a preface prevent me from entering into a justification of my opinions,"
10738,PREFACE.[1],and I am committed on the subject as effectually as if I had written
10739,PREFACE.[1],"volumes in their defence. My reader, however, is apprised of the very"
10740,PREFACE.[1],"cursory observation upon which these opinions are founded, and can easily"
10741,PREFACE.[1],decide for himself upon the degree of attention or confidence which they
10742,PREFACE.[1],merit.
10743,PREFACE.[1],
10744,PREFACE.[1],"With respect to the poems in general, which occupy the following pages, I"
10745,PREFACE.[1],know not in what manner to apologize to the public for intruding upon
10746,PREFACE.[1],"their notice such a mass of unconnected trifles, such a world of epicurean"
10747,PREFACE.[1],atoms as I have here brought in conflict together. To say that I have been
10748,PREFACE.[1],"tempted by the liberal offers of my bookseller, is an excuse which can"
10749,PREFACE.[1],"hope for but little indulgence from the critic; yet I own that, without"
10750,PREFACE.[1],"this seasonable inducement, these poems very possibly would never have"
10751,PREFACE.[1],been submitted to the world. The glare of publication is too strong for
10752,PREFACE.[1],such imperfect productions: they should be shown but to the eye of
10753,PREFACE.[1],"friendship, in that dim light of privacy which is as favorable to poetical"
10754,PREFACE.[1],"as to female beauty, and serves as a veil for faults, while it enhances"
10755,PREFACE.[1],"every charm which it displays. Besides, this is not a period for the idle"
10756,PREFACE.[1],"occupations of poetry, and times like the present require talents more"
10757,PREFACE.[1],"active and more useful. Few have now the leisure to read such trifles, and"
10758,PREFACE.[1],I most sincerely regret that I have had the leisure to write them.

15564,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"Yet I trembled, and something hung o'er me,"
15565,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],That saddened the joy of my mind.
15566,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"I looked for the lamp which, she told me,"
15567,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"Should shine, when her Pilgrim returned;"

15574,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"But no, the young false one had fled."
15575,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],And there hung the lute that could soften

15583,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],Who dared but to wrong thee _in thought_!

15585,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"Of Erin, how fallen is thy fame!"
15586,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"And thro' ages of bondage and slaughter,"
15587,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],Our country shall bleed for thy shame.
15588,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],
15589,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"Already, the curse is upon her,"

15601,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],the first opportunity of profiting by our divisions and subduing us. The
15602,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"following are the circumstances, as related by O'Halloran:--""The king of"
15603,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"Leinster had long conceived a violent affection for Dearbhorgil, daughter"
15604,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"to the king of Meath, and though she had been for some time married to"
15605,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"O'Ruark, prince of Breffni, yet it could not restrain his passion. They"
15606,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"carried on a private correspondence, and she informed him that O'Ruark,"
15607,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],intended soon to go on a pilgrimage (an act of piety frequent in those
15608,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"days), and conjured him to embrace that opportunity of conveying her from"
15609,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],a husband she detested to a lover she adored. MacMurchad too punctually
15610,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"obeyed the summons, and had the lady conveyed to his capital of Ferns.""--"
15611,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"The monarch Roderick espoused the cause of O'Ruark, while MacMurchad fled"

15614,PRINCE OF BREFFNI.[1],"""Such,"" adds Giraldus Cambrensis (as I find him in an old translation)"

22924,THE STRANGER.,
22925,THE STRANGER.,"'Twas one summer night, when the village lay sleeping,"

22939,THE STRANGER.,
22940,THE STRANGER.,"Then her eyes, when she sung--oh, but once to have seen them--"

22943,THE STRANGER.,That spoke more than holiest words to the heart.
22944,THE STRANGER.,
22945,THE STRANGER.,"But she past like a day-dream, no skill could restore her--"
22946,THE STRANGER.,"Whate'er was her sorrow, its ruin came fast;"
22947,THE STRANGER.,She died with the same spell of mystery o'er her.
22948,THE STRANGER.,That song of past days on her lips to the last.
22949,THE STRANGER.,
22950,THE STRANGER.,Not even in the grave is her sad heart reposing--
22951,THE STRANGER.,Still hovers the spirit of grief round her tomb;

28027,THE DAY-DREAM.[1],
28028,THE DAY-DREAM.[1],In vain with hints from other strains
28029,THE DAY-DREAM.[1],I wooed this truant air to come--

28688,THE SUMMER FÊTE,"Tones of a harp, too, gently played,"
28689,THE SUMMER FÊTE,Came with this youthful voice communing;
28690,THE SUMMER FÊTE,"Tones true, for once, without the aid"
28691,THE SUMMER FÊTE,"Of that inflictive process, tuning--"
28692,THE SUMMER FÊTE,A process which must oft have given
28693,THE SUMMER FÊTE,Poor Milton's ears a deadly wound;
28694,THE SUMMER FÊTE,"So pleased, among the joys of Heaven,"
28695,THE SUMMER FÊTE,"He specifies ""harps _ever_ tuned."""
28696,THE SUMMER FÊTE,She who now sung this gentle strain

28717,THE SUMMER FÊTE,
28718,THE SUMMER FÊTE,"Speaking of one of these new Lays,"
28719,THE SUMMER FÊTE,The Morning Post thus sweetly says:--

28756,SONG.,Victorious eyes advancing.
28757,SONG.,Bring forth the robe whose hue of heaven

28783,SONG.,"The gaudy clouds, like courtiers, crept--"
28784,SONG.,"Struggling each other's light to dim,"
28785,SONG.,And catch his last smile e'er he slept.
28786,SONG.,"How gay, as o'er the gliding Thames"
28787,SONG.,"The golden eve its lustre poured,"
28788,SONG.,Shone out the high-born knights and dames
28789,SONG.,Now grouped around that festal board;
28790,SONG.,A living mass of plumes and flowers.
28791,SONG.,As tho' they'd robbed both birds and bowers--

28807,SONG.,It yet was hoped-and well that hope
28808,SONG.,Was answered by the young and gay--
28809,SONG.,That in the toilet's task to-day
28810,SONG.,Fancy should take her wildest scope;--
28811,SONG.,That the rapt milliner should be

28839,SONG.,
28840,SONG.,But where is she--the nymph whom late
28841,SONG.,We left before her glass delaying
28842,SONG.,"Like Eve, when by the lake she sate,"
28843,SONG.,"In the clear wave her charms surveying,"
28844,SONG.,And saw in that first glassy mirror
28845,SONG.,The first fair face that lured to error.

28854,SONG.,"Tho' hid herself, some sidelong ray"
28855,SONG.,"At every step, detects her way."
28856,SONG.,
28857,SONG.,But not in dark disguise to-night
28858,SONG.,Hath our young heroine veiled her light;--
28859,SONG.,"For see, she walks the earth, Love's own."
28860,SONG.,"His wedded bride, by _holiest_ vow"
28861,SONG.,"Pledged in Olympus, and made known"

28863,SONG.,"Hangs glittering on her snowy brow,"
28864,SONG.,"That butterfly, mysterious trinket,"
28865,SONG.,"Which means the Soul (tho' few would think it),"
28866,SONG.,"And sparkling thus on brow so white,"
28867,SONG.,Tells us we've Psyche here tonight!
28868,SONG.,But hark! some song hath caught her ears--
28869,SONG.,"And, lo, how pleased, as tho' she'd ne'er"
28870,SONG.,"Heard the Grand Opera of the Spheres,"
28871,SONG.,Her goddess-ship approves the air;
28872,SONG.,"And to a mere terrestrial strain,"
28873,SONG.,"Inspired by naught but pink champagne,"
28874,SONG.,Her butterfly as gayly nods
28875,SONG.,As tho' she sate with all her train
28876,SONG.,"At some great Concert of the Gods,"
28877,SONG.,"With Phoebus, leader--Jove, director,"
28878,SONG.,And half the audience drunk with nectar.
28879,SONG.,
28880,SONG.,From the male group the carol came--
28881,SONG.,A few gay youths whom round the board
28882,SONG.,The last-tried flask's superior fame
28883,SONG.,Had lured to taste the tide it poured;
28884,SONG.,And one who from his youth and lyre
28885,SONG.,"Seemed grandson to the Teian-sire,"
28886,SONG.,"Thus gayly sung, while, to his song,"
28887,SONG.,Replied in chorus the gay throng:--

28891,SONG.,
28892,SONG.,
28893,SONG.,"Some mortals there may be, so wise, or so fine,"
28894,SONG.,As in evenings like this no enjoyment to see;
28895,SONG.,"But, as I'm not particular--wit, love, and wine,"
28896,SONG.,Are for one night's amusement sufficient for me.
28897,SONG.,Nay--humble and strange as my tastes may appear--
28898,SONG.,"If driven to the worst, I could manage, thank Heaven,"
28899,SONG.,"To put up with eyes such as beam round me here,"
28900,SONG.,"And such wine as we're sipping, six days out of seven."
28901,SONG.,So pledge me a bumper--your sages profound
28902,SONG.,"May be blest, if they will, on their own patent plan:"
28903,SONG.,"But as we are _not_ sages, why--send the cup round--"
28904,SONG.,We must only be happy the best way we can.
28905,SONG.,
28906,SONG.,"A reward by some king was once offered, we're told,"

28912,SONG.,"Let the rich rosy sea I embark on be this,"
28913,SONG.,And such eyes as we've here be the stars of my way!
28914,SONG.,"In the mean time, a bumper--your Angels, on high,"
28915,SONG.,May have pleasures unknown to life's limited span;
28916,SONG.,"But, as we are _not_ Angels, why--let the flask fly--"

28922,SONG.,Leaving but so much of its beam
28923,SONG.,"As gave to objects, late so blight,"
28924,SONG.,The coloring of a shadowy dream;
28925,SONG.,And there was still where Day had set
28926,SONG.,A flush that spoke him loath to die--
28927,SONG.,"A last link of his glory yet,"
28928,SONG.,Binding together earth and sky.
28929,SONG.,"Say, why is it that twilight best"
28930,SONG.,Becomes even brows the loveliest?
28931,SONG.,That dimness with its softening Touch
28932,SONG.,"Can bring out grace unfelt before,"
28933,SONG.,"And charms we ne'er can see too much,"
28934,SONG.,When seen but half enchant the more?
28935,SONG.,"Alas, it is that every joy"
28936,SONG.,"In fulness finds its worst alloy,"
28937,SONG.,"And half a bliss, but hoped or guessed,"
28938,SONG.,Is sweeter than the whole possest;--
28939,SONG.,"That Beauty, when least shone upon,"
28940,SONG.,A creature most ideal grows;
28941,SONG.,And there's no light from moon or sun
28942,SONG.,Like that Imagination throws;--
28943,SONG.,"It is, alas, that Fancy shrinks"
28944,SONG.,"Even from a bright reality,"
28945,SONG.,"And turning inly, feels and thinks"
28946,SONG.,For heavenlier things than e'er will be.
28947,SONG.,
28948,SONG.,Such was the effect of twilight's hour
28949,SONG.,"On the fair groups that, round and round,"
28950,SONG.,"From glade to grot, from bank to bower,"
28951,SONG.,Now wandered thro' this fairy ground;
28952,SONG.,And thus did Fancy--and champagne--
28953,SONG.,"Work on the sight their dazzling spells,"
28954,SONG.,"Till nymphs that looked at noonday plain,"
28955,SONG.,Now brightened in the gloom to belles;
28956,SONG.,"And the brief interval of time,"
28957,SONG.,"'Twixt after dinner and before,"
28958,SONG.,"To dowagers brought back their prime,"
28959,SONG.,And shed a halo round two-score.
28960,SONG.,
28961,SONG.,"Meanwhile, new pastimes for the eye,"
28962,SONG.,"The ear, the fancy, quick succeed;"
28963,SONG.,And now along the waters fly
28964,SONG.,"Light gondoles, of Venetian breed,"
28965,SONG.,"With knights and dames who, calm reclined,"
28966,SONG.,Lisp out love-sonnets as they glide--
28967,SONG.,Astonishing old Thames to find
28968,SONG.,Such doings on his moral tide.
28969,SONG.,
28970,SONG.,"So bright was still that tranquil river,"
28971,SONG.,"With the last shaft from Daylight's quiver,"
28972,SONG.,That many a group in turn were seen
28973,SONG.,Embarking on its wave serene;
28974,SONG.,"And 'mong the rest, in chorus gay,"
28975,SONG.,"A band of mariners, from the isles"

29742,FIRST EVENING.,And thought how many a time with those
29743,FIRST EVENING.,Who now were gone to the rude wars
29744,FIRST EVENING.,"They there had met at evening's close,"
29745,FIRST EVENING.,And danced till morn outshone the stars!
29746,FIRST EVENING.,
29747,FIRST EVENING.,But seldom long doth hang the eclipse

29767,FIRST EVENING.,"That many a nymph tho' pleased the while,"
29768,FIRST EVENING.,"Reproached her own forgetful smile,"

29771,FIRST EVENING.,Among these maidens there was one
29772,FIRST EVENING.,Who to Leucadia[5] late had been--

29781,FIRST EVENING.,
29782,FIRST EVENING.,Mutely they listened all--and well
29783,FIRST EVENING.,Did the young travelled maiden tell
29784,FIRST EVENING.,Of the dread height to which that steep
29785,FIRST EVENING.,Beetles above the eddying deep--[6]
29786,FIRST EVENING.,"Of the lone sea-birds, wheeling round"
29787,FIRST EVENING.,The dizzy edge with mournful sound--
29788,FIRST EVENING.,And of those scented lilies found
29789,FIRST EVENING.,Still blooming on that fearful place--
29790,FIRST EVENING.,As if called up by Love to grace
29791,FIRST EVENING.,The immortal spot o'er which the last
29792,FIRST EVENING.,Bright footsteps of his martyr past!

29800,FIRST EVENING.,"Thus sketched the languishment of soul,"
29801,FIRST EVENING.,That o'er the tender Lesbian stole;
29802,FIRST EVENING.,And in a voice whose thrilling tone
29803,FIRST EVENING.,"Fancy might deem the Lesbian's own,"
29804,FIRST EVENING.,"One of those fervid fragments gave,"

29850,SONG.,Slowly the half-forgotten theme
29851,SONG.,(Tho' born in feelings ne'er forgot)
29852,SONG.,Came to her memory--as a beam

30001,SONG.,"Hat, turban, shawl, as chance might be;"
30002,SONG.,"The grove, their verdant armory,"
30003,SONG.,Falchion and lance[10] alike supplied;

30031,SONG.,Danced in those happy days when Greece was free;

30033,SONG.,Thus trained their steps to war and victory.
30034,SONG.,"""Raise the buckler--poise the lance--"

30052,SONG.,"The combatants, in broken ranks."
30053,SONG.,All breathless from the war-field fly;
30054,SONG.,And down upon the velvet banks

30086,SONG.,"And, there, the last unfinished word"
30087,SONG.,"He dying wrote was ""Liberty!"""
30088,SONG.,
30089,SONG.,At night a Sea-bird shrieked the knell
30090,SONG.,Of him who thus for Freedom fell;

30101,SONG.,"From hearts that feel but fear to praise,"
30102,SONG.,"Followed this song, and left a pause"
30103,SONG.,"Of silence after it, that hung"
30104,SONG.,Like a fixt spell on every tongue.
30105,SONG.,
30106,SONG.,At length a low and tremulous sound
30107,SONG.,Was heard from midst a group that round
30108,SONG.,A bashful maiden stood to hide
30109,SONG.,Her blushes while the lute she tried--
30110,SONG.,Like roses gathering round to veil
30111,SONG.,"The song of some young nightingale,"
30112,SONG.,Whose trembling notes steal out between
30113,SONG.,"The clustered leaves, herself unseen."
30114,SONG.,And while that voice in tones that more
30115,SONG.,"Thro' feeling than thro' weakness erred,"
30116,SONG.,Came with a stronger sweetness o'er
30117,SONG.,"The attentive ear, this strain was heard:--"

30120,SONG.,SONG.
30121,SONG.,
30122,SONG.,
30123,SONG.,"I saw from yonder silent cave,[12]"
30124,SONG.,Two Fountains running side by side;
30125,SONG.,"The one was Memory's limpid wave,"
30126,SONG.,The other cold Oblivion's tide.
30127,SONG.,"""Oh Love!"" said I, in thoughtless mood,"
30128,SONG.,"As deep I drank of Lethe's stream,"
30129,SONG.,"""Be all my sorrows in this flood"
30130,SONG.,"""Forgotten like a vanisht dream!"""
30131,SONG.,
30132,SONG.,But who could bear that gloomy blank
30133,SONG.,Where joy was lost as well as pain?
30134,SONG.,Quickly of Memory's fount I drank.
30135,SONG.,And brought the past all back again;
30136,SONG.,"And said, ""Oh Love! whate'er my lot,"
30137,SONG.,"""Still let this soul to thee be true--"
30138,SONG.,"""Rather than have one bliss forgot,"

30142,SONG.,
30143,SONG.,The group that stood around to shade
30144,SONG.,"The blushes of that bashful maid,"
30145,SONG.,Had by degrees as came the lay
30146,SONG.,"More strongly forth retired away,"
30147,SONG.,Like a fair shell whose valves divide
30148,SONG.,To show the fairer pearl inside:
30149,SONG.,"For such she was--a creature, bright"
30150,SONG.,"And delicate as those day-flowers,"
30151,SONG.,Which while they last make up in light
30152,SONG.,And sweetness what they want in hours.
30153,SONG.,
30154,SONG.,So rich upon the ear had grown
30155,SONG.,Her voice's melody--its tone
30156,SONG.,Gathering new courage as it found
30157,SONG.,An echo in each bosom round--
30158,SONG.,"That, ere the nymph with downcast eye"
30159,SONG.,"Still on the chords, her lute laid by,"
30160,SONG.,"""Another song,"" all lips exclaimed,"
30161,SONG.,And each some matchless favorite named;
30162,SONG.,while blushing as her fingers ran
30163,SONG.,O'er the sweet chords she thus began:--
30164,SONG.,
30165,SONG.,
30166,SONG.,SONG.
30167,SONG.,
30168,SONG.,
30169,SONG.,"Oh, Memory, how coldly"
30170,SONG.,Thou paintest joy gone by:
30171,SONG.,"Like rainbows, thy pictures"
30172,SONG.,But mournfully shine and die.
30173,SONG.,Or if some tints thou keepest
30174,SONG.,"That former days recall,"
30175,SONG.,"As o'er each line thou weepest,"
30176,SONG.,Thy tears efface them all.
30177,SONG.,
30178,SONG.,"But, Memory, too truly"
30179,SONG.,Thou paintest grief that's past;
30180,SONG.,"Joy's colors are fleeting,"
30181,SONG.,But those of Sorrow last.
30182,SONG.,"And, while thou bringst before us"
30183,SONG.,"Dark pictures of past ill,"
30184,SONG.,Life's evening closing o'er us
30185,SONG.,But makes them darker still.

30189,SONG.,"So went the moonlight hours along,"
30190,SONG.,In this sweet glade; and so with song
30191,SONG.,"And witching sounds--not such as they,"
30192,SONG.,"The cymbalists of Ossa, played,"
30193,SONG.,"To chase the moon's eclipse away,[13]"
30194,SONG.,But soft and holy--did each maid
30195,SONG.,"Lighten her heart's eclipse awhile,"
30196,SONG.,And win back Sorrow to a smile.
30197,SONG.,
30198,SONG.,"Not far from this secluded place,"
30199,SONG.,On the sea-shore a ruin stood;--
30200,SONG.,"A relic of the extinguisht race,"
30201,SONG.,"Who once o'er that foamy flood,"
30202,SONG.,When fair Ioulis[14] by the light
30203,SONG.,Of golden sunset on the sight
30204,SONG.,"Of mariners who sailed that sea,"
30205,SONG.,Rose like a city of chrysolite
30206,SONG.,Called from the wave by witchery.
30207,SONG.,This ruin--now by barbarous hands
30208,SONG.,"Debased into a motley shed,"
30209,SONG.,Where the once splendid column stands
30210,SONG.,Inverted on its leafy head--
30211,SONG.,"Formed, as they tell in times of old"
30212,SONG.,The dwelling of that bard whose lay
30213,SONG.,"Could melt to tears the stern and cold,"
30214,SONG.,And sadden mid their mirth the gay--
30215,SONG.,"Simonides,[15] whose fame thro' years"
30216,SONG.,And ages past still bright appears--
30217,SONG.,"Like Hesperus, a star of tears!"
30218,SONG.,
30219,SONG.,'Twas hither now--to catch a view
30220,SONG.,Of the white waters as they played
30221,SONG.,Silently in the light--a few
30222,SONG.,Of the more restless damsels strayed;
30223,SONG.,And some would linger mid the scent
30224,SONG.,Of hanging foliage that perfumed
30225,SONG.,The ruined walls; while others went
30226,SONG.,Culling whatever floweret bloomed
30227,SONG.,
30228,SONG.,"In the lone leafy space between,"
30229,SONG.,Where gilded chambers once had been;
30230,SONG.,"Or, turning sadly to the sea,"
30231,SONG.,Sent o'er the wave a sigh unblest
30232,SONG.,To some brave champion of the Free--
30233,SONG.,"Thinking, alas, how cold might be"
30234,SONG.,At that still hour his place of rest!
30235,SONG.,
30236,SONG.,Meanwhile there came a sound of song
30237,SONG.,"From the dark ruins--a faint strain,"
30238,SONG.,As if some echo that among
30239,SONG.,Those minstrel halls had slumbered long
30240,SONG.,Were murmuring into life again.
30241,SONG.,
30242,SONG.,"But, no--the nymphs knew well the tone--"
30243,SONG.,"A maiden of their train, who loved"
30244,SONG.,Like the night-bird to sing alone.
30245,SONG.,"Had deep into those ruins roved,"
30246,SONG.,"And there, all other thoughts forgot,"
30247,SONG.,"Was warbling o'er, in lone delight,"
30248,SONG.,"A lay that, on that very spot,"
30249,SONG.,Her lover sung one moonlight night:--
30250,SONG.,
30251,SONG.,
30252,SONG.,SONG.
30253,SONG.,
30254,SONG.,
30255,SONG.,"Ah! where are they, who heard, in former hours,"
30256,SONG.,The voice of Song in these neglected bowers?
30257,SONG.,They are gone--all gone!
30258,SONG.,
30259,SONG.,The youth who told his pain in such sweet tone
30260,SONG.,That all who heard him wisht his pain their own--
30261,SONG.,He is gone--he is gone!
30262,SONG.,
30263,SONG.,And she who while he sung sat listening by
30264,SONG.,And thought to strains like these 'twere sweet to die--
30265,SONG.,She is gone--she too is gone!
30266,SONG.,
30267,SONG.,'Tis thus in future hours some bard will say
30268,SONG.,Of her who hears and him who sings this lay--

30274,SONG.,Bending to dip her silvery urn
30275,SONG.,Into the bright and silent deep--
30276,SONG.,"And the young nymphs, on their return"
30277,SONG.,"From those romantic ruins, found"
30278,SONG.,Their other playmates ranged around
30279,SONG.,"The sacred Spring, prepared to tune"
30280,SONG.,"Their parting hymn,[16] ere sunk the moon,"
30281,SONG.,To that fair Fountain by whose stream
30282,SONG.,Their hearts had formed so many a dream.
30283,SONG.,
30284,SONG.,Who has not read the tales that tell
30285,SONG.,"Of old Eleusis' sacred Well,"
30286,SONG.,Or heard what legend-songs recount
30287,SONG.,"Of Syra and its holy Fount,[17]"
30288,SONG.,Gushing at once from the hard rock
30289,SONG.,Into the laps of living flowers--
30290,SONG.,"Where village maidens loved to flock,"
30291,SONG.,On summer-nights and like the Hours
30292,SONG.,"Linked in harmonious dance and song,"
30293,SONG.,Charmed the unconscious night along;
30294,SONG.,While holy pilgrims on their way
30295,SONG.,"To Delos' isle stood looking on,"
30296,SONG.,"Enchanted with a scene so gay,"
30297,SONG.,Nor sought their boats till morning shone.
30298,SONG.,
30299,SONG.,Such was the scene this lovely glade
30300,SONG.,And its fair inmates now displayed.
30301,SONG.,As round the Fount in linked ring
30302,SONG.,They went in cadence slow and light
30303,SONG.,And thus to that enchanted Spring
30304,SONG.,Warbled their Farewell for the night:--

30314,SONG.,"Nothing but Music's strain,"
30315,SONG.,"When Lovers part in pain,"
30316,SONG.,"Soothes till they meet again,"
30317,SONG.,"Oh, Maids of Zea!"
30318,SONG.,
30319,SONG.,Bright Fount so clear and cold
30320,SONG.,Round which the nymphs of old
30321,SONG.,"Stood with their locks of gold,"
30322,SONG.,Fountain of Zea!
30323,SONG.,"Not even Castaly,"
30324,SONG.,"Famed tho' its streamlet be,"

30339,SONG.,"Weave we our mirthful dance,"
30340,SONG.,Daughters of Zea!
30341,SONG.,Such as in former days
30342,SONG.,Danced they by Dian's rays
30343,SONG.,"Where the Eurotas strays,"
30344,SONG.,"Oh, Maids of Zea!"
30345,SONG.,
30346,SONG.,But when to merry feet
30347,SONG.,"Hearts with no echo beat,"

30362,SONG.,
30363,SONG.,
30364,SONG.,When evening shades are falling
30365,SONG.,"O'er Ocean's sunny sleep,"
30366,SONG.,To pilgrims' hearts recalling
30367,SONG.,Their home beyond the deep;
30368,SONG.,When rest o'er all descending
30369,SONG.,"The shores with gladness smile,"
30370,SONG.,And lutes their echoes blending
30371,SONG.,"Are heard from isle to isle,"
30372,SONG.,"Then, Mary, Star of the Sea,"
30373,SONG.,"We pray, we pray, to thee!"
30374,SONG.,
30375,SONG.,"The noon-day tempest over,"
30376,SONG.,"Now Ocean toils no more,"
30377,SONG.,And wings of halcyons hover
30378,SONG.,Where all was strife before.
30379,SONG.,Oh thus may life in closing

30385,SONG.,
30386,SONG.,On Helle's sea the light grew dim
30387,SONG.,As the last sounds of that sweet hymn
30388,SONG.,Floated along its azure tide--
30389,SONG.,Floated in light as if the lay
30390,SONG.,Had mixt with sunset's fading ray
30391,SONG.,And light and song together died.
30392,SONG.,So soft thro' evening's air had breathed
30393,SONG.,That choir of youthful voices wreathed
30394,SONG.,"In many-linked harmony,"
30395,SONG.,That boats then hurrying o'er the sea
30396,SONG.,"Paused when they reached this fairy shore,"
30397,SONG.,And lingered till the strain was o'er.
30398,SONG.,
30399,SONG.,Of those young maids who've met to fleet
30400,SONG.,"In song and dance this evening's hours,"
30401,SONG.,Far happier now the bosoms beat
30402,SONG.,Than when they last adorned these bowers;
30403,SONG.,"For tidings of glad sound had come,"
30404,SONG.,At break of day from the far isles--
30405,SONG.,Tidings like breath of life to some--
30406,SONG.,"That Zea's sons would soon wing home,"
30407,SONG.,Crowded with the light of Victory's smiles
30408,SONG.,To meet that brightest of all meeds
30409,SONG.,"That wait on high, heroic deeds."
30410,SONG.,When gentle eyes that scarce for tears
30411,SONG.,"Could trace the warrior's parting track,"
30412,SONG.,Shall like a misty morn that clears
30413,SONG.,When the long-absent sun appears
30414,SONG.,Shine out all bliss to hail him back.
30415,SONG.,
30416,SONG.,How fickle still the youthful breast!--
30417,SONG.,"More fond of change than a young moon,"
30418,SONG.,No joy so new was e'er possest
30419,SONG.,But Youth would leave for newer soon.
30420,SONG.,These Zean nymphs tho' bright the spot
30421,SONG.,Where first they held their evening play
30422,SONG.,As ever fell to fairy's lot
30423,SONG.,"To wanton o'er by midnight's ray,"
30424,SONG.,Had now exchanged that sheltered scene
30425,SONG.,For a wide glade beside the sea--
30426,SONG.,A lawn whose soft expanse of green
30427,SONG.,Turned to the west sun smilingly
30428,SONG.,As tho' in conscious beauty bright
30429,SONG.,It joyed to give him light for light.
30430,SONG.,
30431,SONG.,And ne'er did evening more serene
30432,SONG.,Look down from heaven on lovelier scene.
30433,SONG.,Calm lay the flood around while fleet
30434,SONG.,O'er the blue shining element
30435,SONG.,Light barks as if with fairy feet
30436,SONG.,That stirred not the husht waters went;
30437,SONG.,"Some, that ere rosy eve fell o'er"
30438,SONG.,"The blushing wave, with mainsail free,"
30439,SONG.,"Had put forth from the Attic shore,"
30440,SONG.,Or the near Isle of Ebony;--
30441,SONG.,"Some, Hydriot barks that deep in caves"
30442,SONG.,"Beneath Colonna's pillared cliffs,"
30443,SONG.,Had all day lurked and o'er the waves
30444,SONG.,Now shot their long and dart-like skiffs.
30445,SONG.,Woe to the craft however fleet
30446,SONG.,"These sea-hawks in their course shall meet,"
30447,SONG.,"Laden with juice of Lesbian vines,"
30448,SONG.,Or rich from Naxos' emery mines;
30449,SONG.,"For not more sure, when owlets flee"
30450,SONG.,"O'er the dark crags of Pendelee,"
30451,SONG.,"Doth the night-falcon mark his prey,"
30452,SONG.,Or pounce on it more fleet than they.
30453,SONG.,
30454,SONG.,And what a moon now lights the glade
30455,SONG.,Where these young island nymphs are met!
30456,SONG.,Full-orbed yet pure as if no shade
30457,SONG.,Had touched its virgin lustre yet;
30458,SONG.,And freshly bright as if just made
30459,SONG.,By Love's own hands of new-born light
30460,SONG.,Stolen from his mother's star tonight.
30461,SONG.,
30462,SONG.,On a bold rock that o'er the flood
30463,SONG.,Jutted from that soft glade there stood
30464,SONG.,"A Chapel, fronting towards the sea,--"
30465,SONG.,"Built in some by-gone century,--"
30466,SONG.,Where nightly as the seaman's mark
30467,SONG.,"When waves rose high or clouds were dark,"
30468,SONG.,A lamp bequeathed by some kind Saint
30469,SONG.,Shed o'er the wave its glimmer faint.
30470,SONG.,Waking in way-worn men a sigh
30471,SONG.,And prayer to heaven as they went by.
30472,SONG.,"'Twas there, around that rock-built shrine"
30473,SONG.,A group of maidens and their sires
30474,SONG.,"Had stood to watch the day's decline,"
30475,SONG.,And as the light fell o'er their lyres
30476,SONG.,Sung to the Queen-Star of the Sea
30477,SONG.,That soft and holy melody.
30478,SONG.,
30479,SONG.,But lighter thoughts and lighter song
30480,SONG.,Now woo the coming hours along.
30481,SONG.,"For mark, where smooth the herbage lies,"
30482,SONG.,Yon gay pavilion curtained deep
30483,SONG.,With silken folds thro' which bright eyes
30484,SONG.,From time to time are seen to peep;
30485,SONG.,While twinkling lights that to and fro
30486,SONG.,"Beneath those veils like meteors go,"
30487,SONG.,Tell of some spells at work and keep
30488,SONG.,"Young fancies chained in mute suspense,"
30489,SONG.,"Watching what next may shine from thence,"
30490,SONG.,Nor long the pause ere hands unseen
30491,SONG.,"That mystic curtain backward drew,"
30492,SONG.,And all that late but shone between
30493,SONG.,In half-caught gleams now burst to view.
30494,SONG.,
30495,SONG.,A picture 'twas of the early days
30496,SONG.,Of glorious Greece ere yet those rays
30497,SONG.,"Of rich, immortal Mind were hers"
30498,SONG.,That made mankind her worshippers;
30499,SONG.,While yet unsung her landscapes shone
30500,SONG.,With glory lent by heaven alone;
30501,SONG.,"Nor temples crowned her nameless hills,"
30502,SONG.,Nor Muse immortalized her rills;
30503,SONG.,Nor aught but the mute poesy
30504,SONG.,Of sun and stars and shining sea
30505,SONG.,Illumed that land of bards to be.
30506,SONG.,While prescient of the gifted race
30507,SONG.,"That yet would realm so blest adorn,"
30508,SONG.,Nature took pains to deck the place
30509,SONG.,Where glorious Art was to be born.
30510,SONG.,
30511,SONG.,Such was the scene that mimic stage
30512,SONG.,Of Athens and her hills portrayed
30513,SONG.,"Athens in her first, youthful age,"
30514,SONG.,"Ere yet the simple violet braid,[18]"
30515,SONG.,Which then adorned her had shone down
30516,SONG.,The glory of earth's loftiest crown.
30517,SONG.,"While yet undreamed, her seeds of Art"
30518,SONG.,Lay sleeping in the marble mine--
30519,SONG.,Sleeping till Genius bade them start
30520,SONG.,To all but life in shapes divine;
30521,SONG.,Till deified the quarry shone
30522,SONG.,And all Olympus stood in stone!
30523,SONG.,
30524,SONG.,"There in the foreground of that scene,"
30525,SONG.,On a soft bank of living green
30526,SONG.,Sate a young nymph with her lap full
30527,SONG.,"Of the newly gathered flowers, o'er which"
30528,SONG.,She graceful leaned intent to cull
30529,SONG.,"All that was there of hue most rich,"
30530,SONG.,To form a wreath such as the eye
30531,SONG.,"Of her young lover who stood by,"
30532,SONG.,With pallet mingled fresh might choose
30533,SONG.,To fix by Painting's rainbow hues.
30534,SONG.,
30535,SONG.,The wreath was formed; the maiden raised
30536,SONG.,"Her speaking eyes to his, while he--"
30537,SONG.,"Oh _not_ upon the flowers now gazed,"
30538,SONG.,But on that bright look's witchery.
30539,SONG.,"While, quick as if but then the thought"
30540,SONG.,"Like light had reached his soul, he caught"
30541,SONG.,His pencil up and warm and true
30542,SONG.,As life itself that love-look drew:
30543,SONG.,"And, as his raptured task went on,"
30544,SONG.,"And forth each kindling feature shone,"
30545,SONG.,Sweet voices thro' the moonlight air
30546,SONG.,From lips as moonlight fresh and pure
30547,SONG.,"Thus hailed the bright dream passing there,"
30548,SONG.,And sung the Birth of Portraiture.[19]
30549,SONG.,
30550,SONG.,
30551,SONG.,SONG.
30552,SONG.,
30553,SONG.,
30554,SONG.,As once a Grecian maiden wove
30555,SONG.,"Her garland mid the summer bowers,"
30556,SONG.,There stood a youth with eyes of love
30557,SONG.,To watch her while she wreathed the flowers.
30558,SONG.,"The youth was skilled in Painting's art,"
30559,SONG.,"But ne'er had studied woman's brow,"
30560,SONG.,Nor knew what magic hues the heart
30561,SONG.,Can shed o'er Nature's charms till now.
30562,SONG.,
30563,SONG.,
30564,CHORUS.,CHORUS.
30565,CHORUS.,
30566,CHORUS.,
30567,CHORUS.,Blest be Love to whom we owe
30568,CHORUS.,All that's fair and bright below.
30569,CHORUS.,
30570,CHORUS.,His hand had pictured many a rose
30571,CHORUS.,And sketched the rays that light the brook;
30572,CHORUS.,But what were these or what were those
30573,CHORUS.,"To woman's blush, to woman's look?"
30574,CHORUS.,"""Oh, if such magic power there be,"
30575,CHORUS.,"""This, this,"" he cried, ""is all my prayer,"
30576,CHORUS.,"""To paint that living light I see"
30577,CHORUS.,"""And fix the soul that sparkles there."""
30578,CHORUS.,
30579,CHORUS.,His prayer as soon as breathed was heard;
30580,CHORUS.,"His pallet touched by Love grew warm,"
30581,CHORUS.,And Painting saw her hues transferred
30582,CHORUS.,From lifeless flowers to woman's form.
30583,CHORUS.,"Still as from tint to tint he stole,"
30584,CHORUS.,"The fair design shone out the more,"
30585,CHORUS.,"And there was now a life, a soul,"
30586,CHORUS.,Where only colors glowed before.
30587,CHORUS.,
30588,CHORUS.,Then first carnations learned to speak
30589,CHORUS.,And lilies into life were brought;
30590,CHORUS.,While mantling on the maiden's cheek
30591,CHORUS.,Young roses kindled into thought.
30592,CHORUS.,Then hyacinths their darkest dyes
30593,CHORUS.,Upon the locks of Beauty threw;
30594,CHORUS.,And violets transformed to eyes
30595,CHORUS.,Inshrined a soul within their blue.
30596,CHORUS.,
30597,CHORUS.,
30598,CHORUS.,CHORUS.
30599,CHORUS.,
30600,CHORUS.,
30601,CHORUS.,"Blest be Love to whom we owe,"
30602,CHORUS.,All that's fair and bright below.
30603,CHORUS.,Song was cold and Painting dim
30604,CHORUS.,Till Song and Painting learned from him.
30605,CHORUS.,
30606,CHORUS.,*       *       *       *       *
30607,CHORUS.,
30608,CHORUS.,"Soon as the scene had closed, a cheer"
30609,CHORUS.,Of gentle voices old and young
30610,CHORUS.,Rose from the groups that stood to hear
30611,CHORUS.,This tale of yore so aptly sung;
30612,CHORUS.,And while some nymphs in haste to tell
30613,CHORUS.,The workers of that fairy spell
30614,CHORUS.,How crowned with praise their task had been
30615,CHORUS.,"Stole in behind the curtained scene,"
30616,CHORUS.,The rest in happy converse strayed--
30617,CHORUS.,Talking that ancient love-tale o'er--
30618,CHORUS.,"Some to the groves that skirt the glade,"
30619,CHORUS.,"Some to the chapel by the shore,"
30620,CHORUS.,To look what lights were on the sea.
30621,CHORUS.,And think of the absent silently.
30622,CHORUS.,
30623,CHORUS.,But soon that summons known so well
30624,CHORUS.,"Thro' bower and hall in Eastern lands,"
30625,CHORUS.,Whose sound more sure than gong or bell
30626,CHORUS.,"Lovers and slaves alike commands,--"
30627,CHORUS.,"The clapping of young female hands,"
30628,CHORUS.,Calls back the groups from rock and field
30629,CHORUS.,To see some new-formed scene revealed;--
30630,CHORUS.,And fleet and eager down the slopes
30631,CHORUS.,Of the green glades like antelopes
30632,CHORUS.,When in their thirst they hear the sound
30633,CHORUS.,"Of distant rills, the light nymphs bound."
30634,CHORUS.,
30635,CHORUS.,Far different now the scene--a waste
30636,CHORUS.,"Of Libyan sands, by moonlight's ray;"
30637,CHORUS.,"An ancient well, whereon were traced"
30638,CHORUS.,"The warning words, for such as stray"
30639,CHORUS.,"Unarmed there, ""Drink and away!""[20]"
30640,CHORUS.,"While near it from the night-ray screened,"
30641,CHORUS.,"And like his bells in husht repose,"
30642,CHORUS.,A camel slept--young as if weaned
30643,CHORUS.,When last the star Canopus rose.[21]
30644,CHORUS.,
30645,CHORUS.,Such was the back-ground's silent scene;--
30646,CHORUS.,While nearer lay fast slumbering too
30647,CHORUS.,In a rude tent with brow serene
30648,CHORUS.,A youth whose cheeks of wayworn hue
30649,CHORUS.,And pilgrim-bonnet told the tale
30650,CHORUS.,That he had been to Mecca's Vale:
30651,CHORUS.,"Haply in pleasant dreams, even now"
30652,CHORUS.,Thinking the long wished hour is come
30653,CHORUS.,When o'er the well-known porch at home
30654,CHORUS.,His hand shall hang the aloe bough--
30655,CHORUS.,Trophy of his accomplished vow.[22]
30656,CHORUS.,
30657,CHORUS.,But brief his dream--for now the call
30658,CHORUS.,"Of the camp-chiefs from rear to van,"
30659,CHORUS.,"""Bind on your burdens,""[23] wakes up all"
30660,CHORUS.,The widely slumbering caravan;
30661,CHORUS.,And thus meanwhile to greet the ear
30662,CHORUS.,"Of the young pilgrim as he wakes,"
30663,CHORUS.,The song of one who lingering near
30664,CHORUS.,"Had watched his slumber, cheerly breaks."
30665,CHORUS.,
30666,CHORUS.,
30667,SONG.,SONG.
30668,SONG.,
30669,SONG.,
30670,SONG.,Up and march! the timbrel's sound
30671,SONG.,Wakes the slumbering camp around;
30672,SONG.,"Fleet thy hour of rest hath gone,"
30673,SONG.,"Armed sleeper, up, and on!"
30674,SONG.,Long and weary is our way
30675,SONG.,O'er the burning sands to-day;
30676,SONG.,But to pilgrim's homeward feet
30677,SONG.,Even the desert's path is sweet.
30678,SONG.,
30679,SONG.,"When we lie at dead of night,"
30680,SONG.,"Looking up to heaven's light,"
30681,SONG.,Hearing but the watchmans tone
30682,SONG.,"Faintly chanting ""God is one,""[24]"
30683,SONG.,Oh what thoughts then o'er us come
30684,SONG.,"Of our distant village home,"
30685,SONG.,Where that chant when evening sets
30686,SONG.,Sounds from all the minarets.
30687,SONG.,
30688,SONG.,"Cheer thee!--soon shall signal lights,"
30689,SONG.,"Kindling o'er the Red Sea heights,"
30690,SONG.,"Kindling quick from man to man,"
30691,SONG.,Hail our coming caravan:[25]
30692,SONG.,Think what bliss that hour will be!
30693,SONG.,"Looks of home again to see,"
30694,SONG.,And our names again to hear
30695,SONG.,Murmured out by voices dear.
30696,SONG.,
30697,SONG.,*        *        *        *        *
30698,SONG.,
30699,SONG.,"So past the desert dream away,"
30700,SONG.,"Fleeting as his who heard this lay,"
30701,SONG.,"Nor long the pause between, nor moved"
30702,SONG.,The spell-bound audience from that spot;
30703,SONG.,While still as usual Fancy roved
30704,SONG.,On to the joy that yet was not;--
30705,SONG.,"Fancy who hath no present home,"
30706,SONG.,"But builds her bower in scenes to come,"
30707,SONG.,Walking for ever in a light
30708,SONG.,That flows from regions out of sight.
30709,SONG.,
30710,SONG.,But see by gradual dawn descried
30711,SONG.,A mountain realm-rugged as e'er
30712,SONG.,"Upraised to heaven its summits bare,"
30713,SONG.,Or told to earth with frown of pride
30714,SONG.,"That Freedom's falcon nest was there,"
30715,SONG.,Too high for hand of lord or king
30716,SONG.,"To hood her brow, or chain her wing."
30717,SONG.,
30718,SONG.,"'Tis Maina's land--her ancient hills,"
30719,SONG.,The abode of nymphs--her countless rills
30720,SONG.,And torrents in their downward dash
30721,SONG.,Shining like silver thro' the shade
30722,SONG.,Of the sea-pine and flowering ash--
30723,SONG.,All with a truth so fresh portrayed
30724,SONG.,As wants but touch of life to be
30725,SONG.,A world of warm reality.
30726,SONG.,
30727,SONG.,And now light bounding forth a band
30728,SONG.,"Of mountaineers, all smiles, advance--"
30729,SONG.,Nymphs with their lovers hand in hand
30730,SONG.,Linked in the Ariadne dance;
30731,SONG.,"And while, apart from that gay throng,"
30732,SONG.,A minstrel youth in varied song
30733,SONG.,"Tells of the loves, the joys, the ills"
30734,SONG.,"Of these wild children of the hills,"
30735,SONG.,The rest by turns or fierce or gay
30736,SONG.,As war or sport inspires the lay
30737,SONG.,Follow each change that wakes the strings
30738,SONG.,And act what thus the lyrist sings:--
30739,SONG.,
30740,SONG.,
30741,SONG.,SONG.
30742,SONG.,
30743,SONG.,
30744,SONG.,"No life is like the mountaineer's,"
30745,SONG.,"His home is near the sky,"
30746,SONG.,Where throned above this world he hears
30747,SONG.,"Its strife at distance die,"
30748,SONG.,Or should the sound of hostile drum
30749,SONG.,"Proclaim below, ""We come--we come,"""
30750,SONG.,Each crag that towers in air
30751,SONG.,"Gives answer, ""Come who dare!"""
30752,SONG.,"While like bees from dell and dingle,"
30753,SONG.,"Swift the swarming warriors mingle,"
30754,SONG.,"And their cry ""Hurra!"" will be,"
30755,SONG.,"""Hurra, to victory!"""
30756,SONG.,
30757,SONG.,Then when battle's hour is over
30758,SONG.,See the happy mountain lover
30759,SONG.,With the nymph who'll soon be bride
30760,SONG.,"Seated blushing by his side,--"
30761,SONG.,Every shadow of his lot
30762,SONG.,In her sunny smile forgot.
30763,SONG.,"Oh, no life is like the mountaineer's."
30764,SONG.,"His home is near the sky,"
30765,SONG.,Where throned above this world he hears
30766,SONG.,Its strife at distance die.
30767,SONG.,Nor only thus thro' summer suns
30768,SONG.,His blithe existence cheerly runs--
30769,SONG.,Even winter bleak and dim
30770,SONG.,Brings joyous hours to him;
30771,SONG.,When his rifle behind him flinging
30772,SONG.,"He watches the roe-buck springing,"
30773,SONG.,"And away, o'er the hills away"
30774,SONG.,"Re-echoes his glad ""hurra."""
30775,SONG.,
30776,SONG.,"Then how blest when night is closing,"
30777,SONG.,"By the kindled hearth reposing,"
30778,SONG.,"To his rebeck's drowsy song,"
30779,SONG.,He beguiles the hour along;
30780,SONG.,Or provoked by merry glances
30781,SONG.,"To a brisker movement dances,"
30782,SONG.,"Till, weary at last, in slumber's chain,"
30783,SONG.,"He dreams o'er chase and dance again,"
30784,SONG.,"Dreams, dreams them o'er again."
30785,SONG.,
30786,SONG.,*        *        *        *        *
30787,SONG.,
30788,SONG.,As slow that minstrel at the close
30789,SONG.,"Sunk while he sung to feigned repose,"
30790,SONG.,Aptly did they whose mimic art
30791,SONG.,Followed the changes of his lay
30792,SONG.,"Portray the lull, the nod, the start,"
30793,SONG.,Thro' which as faintly died away
30794,SONG.,"His lute and voice, the minstrel past,"
30795,SONG.,Till voice and lute lay husht at last.
30796,SONG.,
30797,SONG.,But now far other song came o'er
30798,SONG.,Their startled ears--song that at first
30799,SONG.,As solemnly the night-wind bore
30800,SONG.,"Across the wave its mournful burst,"
30801,SONG.,Seemed to the fancy like a dirge
30802,SONG.,"Of some lone Spirit of the Sea,"
30803,SONG.,Singing o'er Helle's ancient surge
30804,SONG.,The requiem of her Brave and Free.
30805,SONG.,
30806,SONG.,Sudden amid their pastime pause
30807,SONG.,The wondering nymphs; and as the sound
30808,SONG.,"Of that strange music nearer draws,"
30809,SONG.,"With mute inquiring eye look round,"
30810,SONG.,Asking each other what can be
30811,SONG.,The source of this sad minstrelsy?
30812,SONG.,"Nor longer can they doubt, the song"
30813,SONG.,Comes from some island-bark which now
30814,SONG.,Courses the bright waves swift along
30815,SONG.,And soon perhaps beneath the brow
30816,SONG.,Of the Saint's Bock will shoot its prow.
30817,SONG.,
30818,SONG.,Instantly all with hearts that sighed
30819,SONG.,"'Twixt fear's and fancy's influence,"
30820,SONG.,Flew to the rock and saw from thence
30821,SONG.,"A red-sailed pinnace towards them glide,"
30822,SONG.,Whose shadow as it swept the spray
30823,SONG.,Scattered the moonlight's smiles away.
30824,SONG.,Soon as the mariners saw that throng
30825,SONG.,"From the cliff gazing, young and old,"
30826,SONG.,"Sudden they slacked their sail and song,"
30827,SONG.,And while their pinnace idly rolled
30828,SONG.,"On the light surge, these tidings told:--"
30829,SONG.,
30830,SONG.,"'Twas from an isle of mournful name,"
30831,SONG.,"From Missolonghi, last they came--"
30832,SONG.,Sad Missolonghi sorrowing yet
30833,SONG.,"O'er him, the noblest Star of Fame"
30834,SONG.,That e'er in life's young glory set!--
30835,SONG.,"And now were on their mournful way,"
30836,SONG.,Wafting the news thro' Helle's isles;--
30837,SONG.,News that would cloud even Freedom's ray
30838,SONG.,And sadden Victory mid her smiles.
30839,SONG.,
30840,SONG.,"Their tale thus told and heard with pain,"
30841,SONG.,Out spread the galliot's wings again;
30842,SONG.,And as she sped her swift career
30843,SONG.,Again that Hymn rose on the ear--
30844,SONG.,"""Thou art not dead--thou art not dead!"""
30845,SONG.,As oft 'twas sung in ages flown
30846,SONG.,"Of him, the Athenian, who to shed"
30847,SONG.,A tyrant's blood poured out his own.
30848,SONG.,
30849,SONG.,
30850,SONG.,SONG.
30851,SONG.,
30852,SONG.,
30853,SONG.,Thou art not dead--thou art not dead!
30854,SONG.,"No, dearest Harmodius, no."
30855,SONG.,Thy soul to realms above us fled
30856,SONG.,Tho' like a star it dwells o'er head
30857,SONG.,Still lights this world below.
30858,SONG.,Thou art _not_ dead--thou art not dead!
30859,SONG.,"No, dearest Harmodius, no."
30860,SONG.,
30861,SONG.,Thro' isles of light where heroes tread
30862,SONG.,"And flowers ethereal blow,"
30863,SONG.,"Thy god-like Spirit now is led,"
30864,SONG.,Thy lip with life ambrosial fed
30865,SONG.,Forgets all taste of woe.
30866,SONG.,Thou art not dead--thou art not dead!
30867,SONG.,"No, dearest Harmodius, no."
30868,SONG.,
30869,SONG.,The myrtle round that falchion spread
30870,SONG.,"Which struck the immortal blow,"
30871,SONG.,Throughout all time with leaves unshed--
30872,SONG.,"The patriot's hope, the tyrant's dread--"
30873,SONG.,Round Freedom's shrine shall grow.
30874,SONG.,Thou art not dead--thou art not dead!
30875,SONG.,"No, dearest Harmodius, no."
30876,SONG.,
30877,SONG.,"Where hearts like thine have broke or bled,"
30878,SONG.,"Tho' quenched the vital glow,"
30879,SONG.,"Their memory lights a flame instead,"
30880,SONG.,Which even from out the narrow bed
30881,SONG.,Of death its beams shall throw.
30882,SONG.,Thou art not dead--thou art not dead!
30883,SONG.,"No, dearest Harmodius, no."
30884,SONG.,
30885,SONG.,"Thy name, by myriads sung and said,"
30886,SONG.,"From age to age shall go,"
30887,SONG.,"Long as the oak and ivy wed,"
30888,SONG.,"As bees shall haunt Hymettus' head,"
30889,SONG.,Or Helle's waters flow.
30890,SONG.,Thou art not dead--thou art not dead!
30891,SONG.,"No, dearest Harmodius, no."
30892,SONG.,
30893,SONG.,*       *       *       *       *
30894,SONG.,
30895,SONG.,"'Mong those who lingered listening there,--"
30896,SONG.,Listening with ear and eye as long
30897,SONG.,As breath of night could towards them bear
30898,SONG.,"A murmur of that mournful song,--"
30899,SONG.,A few there were in whom the lay
30900,SONG.,Had called up feelings far too sad
30901,SONG.,"To pass with the brief strain away,"
30902,SONG.,Or turn at once to theme more glad;
30903,SONG.,And who in mood untuned to meet
30904,SONG.,"The light laugh of the happie train,"
30905,SONG.,Wandered to seek some moonlight seat
30906,SONG.,"Where they might rest, in converse sweet,"
30907,SONG.,Till vanisht smiles should come again.
30908,SONG.,
30909,SONG.,And seldom e'er hath noon of night
30910,SONG.,To sadness lent more soothing light.
30911,SONG.,On one side in the dark blue sky
30912,SONG.,Lonely and radiant was the eye
30913,SONG.,"Of Jove himself, while on the other"
30914,SONG.,"'Mong tiny stars that round her gleamed,"
30915,SONG.,The young moon like the Roman mother
30916,SONG.,"Among her living ""jewels"" beamed."
30917,SONG.,
30918,SONG.,"Touched by the lovely scenes around,"
30919,SONG.,"A pensive maid--one who, tho' young,"
30920,SONG.,Had known what 'twas to see unwound
30921,SONG.,The ties by which her heart had clung--
30922,SONG.,"Wakened her soft tamboura's sound,"
30923,SONG.,And to its faint accords thus sung:--
30924,SONG.,
30925,SONG.,
30926,SONG.,SONG.
30927,SONG.,
30928,SONG.,
30929,SONG.,Calm as beneath its mother's eyes
30930,SONG.,"In sleep the smiling infant lies,"
30931,SONG.,So watched by all the stars of night
30932,SONG.,Yon landscape sleeps in light.
30933,SONG.,"And while the night-breeze dies away,"
30934,SONG.,"Like relics of some faded strain,"
30935,SONG.,"Loved voices, lost for many a day,"
30936,SONG.,Seem whispering round again.
30937,SONG.,Oh youth! oh love! ye dreams that shed
30938,SONG.,Such glory once--where are ye fled?
30939,SONG.,
30940,SONG.,Pure ray of light that down the sky
30941,SONG.,"Art pointing like an angel's wand,"
30942,SONG.,As if to guide to realms that lie
30943,SONG.,In that bright sea beyond:
30944,SONG.,Who knows but in some brighter deep
30945,SONG.,"Than even that tranquil, moonlit main,"
30946,SONG.,Some land may lie where those who weep
30947,SONG.,Shall wake to smile again!
30948,SONG.,With cheeks that had regained their power
30949,SONG.,"And play of smiles,--and each bright eye"
30950,SONG.,Like violets after morning's shower
30951,SONG.,"The brighter for the tears gone by,"
30952,SONG.,Back to the scene such smiles should grace
30953,SONG.,"These wandering nymphs their path retrace,"
30954,SONG.,And reach the spot with rapture new
30955,SONG.,Just as the veils asunder flew
30956,SONG.,And a fresh vision burst to view.
30957,SONG.,
30958,SONG.,"There by her own bright Attic flood,"
30959,SONG.,The blue-eyed Queen of Wisdom stood;--
30960,SONG.,"Not as she haunts the sage's dreams,"
30961,SONG.,"With brow unveiled, divine, severe;"
30962,SONG.,But softened as on bards she beams
30963,SONG.,When fresh from Poesy's high sphere
30964,SONG.,"A music not her own she brings,"
30965,SONG.,And thro' the veil which Fancy flings
30966,SONG.,O'er her stern features gently sings.
30967,SONG.,
30968,SONG.,"But who is he--that urchin nigh,"
30969,SONG.,"With quiver on the rose-trees hung,"
30970,SONG.,"Who seems just dropt from yonder sky,"
30971,SONG.,And stands to watch that maid with eye
30972,SONG.,So full of thought for one so young?--
30973,SONG.,"That child--but, silence! lend thine ear,"
30974,SONG.,And thus in song the tale thou'lt hear:--
30975,SONG.,
30976,SONG.,
30977,SONG.,SONG.
30978,SONG.,
30979,SONG.,
30980,SONG.,"As Love one summer eve was straying,"
30981,SONG.,Who should he see at that soft hour
30982,SONG.,But young Minerva gravely playing
30983,SONG.,Her flute within an olive bower.
30984,SONG.,"I need not say, 'tis Love's opinion"
30985,SONG.,"That grave or merry, good or ill,"
30986,SONG.,"The sex all bow to his dominion,"
30987,SONG.,As woman will be woman still.
30988,SONG.,
30989,SONG.,Tho' seldom yet the boy hath given
30990,SONG.,"To learned dames his smiles or sighs,"
30991,SONG.,So handsome Pallas looked that even
30992,SONG.,Love quite forgot the maid was wise.
30993,SONG.,"Besides, a youth of his discerning"
30994,SONG.,Knew well that by a shady rill
30995,SONG.,At sunset hour whate'er her learning
30996,SONG.,A woman will be woman still.
30997,SONG.,
30998,SONG.,"Her flute he praised in terms extatic,--"
30999,SONG.,"Wishing it dumb, nor cared how soon.--"
31000,SONG.,"For Wisdom's notes, howe'er chromatic,"
31001,SONG.,To Love seem always out of tune.
31002,SONG.,"But long as he found face to flatter,"
31003,SONG.,The nymph found breath to shake and thrill;
31004,SONG.,"As, weak or wise--it doesn't matter--"
31005,SONG.,Woman at heart is woman still.
31006,SONG.,
31007,SONG.,"Love changed his plan, with warmth exclaiming,"
31008,SONG.,"""How rosy was her lips' soft dye!"""
31009,SONG.,"And much that flute the flatterer blaming,"
31010,SONG.,For twisting lips so sweet awry.
31011,SONG.,"The nymph looked down, beheld her features"
31012,SONG.,"Reflected in the passing rill,"
31013,SONG.,"And started, shocked--for, ah, ye creatures!"
31014,SONG.,Even when divine you're women still.
31015,SONG.,
31016,SONG.,Quick from the lips it made so odious.
31017,SONG.,That graceless flute the Goddess took
31018,SONG.,"And while yet filled with breath melodious,"
31019,SONG.,Flung it into the glassy brook;
31020,SONG.,Where as its vocal life was fleeting
31021,SONG.,"Adown the current, faint and shrill,"
31022,SONG.,"'Twas heard in plaintive tone repeating,"
31023,SONG.,"""Woman, alas, vain woman still!"""
31024,SONG.,
31025,SONG.,*       *       *       *       *
31026,SONG.,
31027,SONG.,An interval of dark repose--
31028,SONG.,"Such as the summer lightning knows,"
31029,SONG.,"Twixt flash and flash, as still more bright"
31030,SONG.,"The quick revealment comes and goes,"
31031,SONG.,"Opening each time the veils of night,"
31032,SONG.,To show within a world of light--
31033,SONG.,"Such pause, so brief, now past between"
31034,SONG.,This last gay vision and the scene
31035,SONG.,Which now its depth of light disclosed.
31036,SONG.,"A bower it seemed, an Indian bower,"
31037,SONG.,"Within whose shade a nymph reposed,"
31038,SONG.,Sleeping away noon's sunny hour--
31039,SONG.,"Lovely as she, the Sprite, who weaves"
31040,SONG.,"Her mansion of sweet Durva leaves,"
31041,SONG.,"And there, as Indian legends say,"
31042,SONG.,Dreams the long summer hours away.
31043,SONG.,And mark how charmed this sleeper seems
31044,SONG.,"With some hid fancy--she, too, dreams!"
31045,SONG.,Oh for a wizard's art to tell
31046,SONG.,The wonders that now bless her sight!
31047,SONG.,"'Tis done--a truer, holier spell"
31048,SONG.,Than e'er from wizard's lip yet fell.
31049,SONG.,Thus brings her vision all to light:--
31050,SONG.,
31051,SONG.,
31052,SONG.,SONG.
31053,SONG.,
31054,SONG.,
31055,SONG.,"""Who comes so gracefully"
31056,SONG.,"""Gliding along"
31057,SONG.,"""While the blue rivulet"
31058,SONG.,"""Sleeps to her song;"
31059,SONG.,"""Song richly vying"
31060,SONG.,"""With the faint sighing"
31061,SONG.,"""Which swans in dying"
31062,SONG.,"""Sweetly prolong?"""
31063,SONG.,
31064,SONG.,So sung the shepherd-boy
31065,SONG.,"By the stream's side,"
31066,SONG.,Watching that fairy-boat
31067,SONG.,"Down the flood glide,"
31068,SONG.,"Like a bird winging,"
31069,SONG.,Thro' the waves bringing
31070,SONG.,"That Syren, singing"
31071,SONG.,To the husht tide.
31072,SONG.,
31073,SONG.,"""Stay,"" said the shepherd-boy,"
31074,SONG.,"""Fairy-boat, stay,"
31075,SONG.,"""Linger, sweet minstrelsy,"
31076,SONG.,"""Linger a day."""
31077,SONG.,"But vain his pleading,"
31078,SONG.,"Past him, unheeding,"
31079,SONG.,"Song and boat, speeding,"
31080,SONG.,Glided away.
31081,SONG.,
31082,SONG.,So to our youthful eyes
31083,SONG.,Joy and hope shone;
31084,SONG.,So while we gazed on them
31085,SONG.,Fast they flew on;--
31086,SONG.,Like flowers declining
31087,SONG.,"Even in the twining,"
31088,SONG.,One moment shining.
31089,SONG.,And the next gone!
31090,SONG.,
31091,SONG.,*       *       *       *       *
31092,SONG.,
31093,SONG.,"Soon as the imagined dream went by,"
31094,SONG.,"Uprose the nymph, with anxious eye"
31095,SONG.,Turned to the clouds as tho' some boon
31096,SONG.,"She waited from that sun-bright dome,"
31097,SONG.,And marvelled that it came not soon
31098,SONG.,As her young thoughts would have it come.
31099,SONG.,
31100,SONG.,But joy is in her glance!--the wing
31101,SONG.,Of a white bird is seen above;
31102,SONG.,"And oh, if round his neck he bring"
31103,SONG.,"The long-wished tidings from her love,"
31104,SONG.,Not half so precious in her eyes
31105,SONG.,Even that high-omened bird[26] would be.
31106,SONG.,Who dooms the brow o'er which he flies
31107,SONG.,To wear a crown of royalty.
31108,SONG.,
31109,SONG.,She had herself last evening sent
31110,SONG.,A winged messenger whose flight
31111,SONG.,"Thro' the clear, roseate element,"
31112,SONG.,She watched till lessening out of sight
31113,SONG.,"Far to the golden West it went,"
31114,SONG.,"Wafting to him, her distant love,"
31115,SONG.,A missive in that language wrought
31116,SONG.,"Which flowers can speak when aptly wove,"
31117,SONG.,"Each hue a word, each leaf a thought."
31118,SONG.,
31119,SONG.,"And now--oh speed of pinion, known"
31120,SONG.,To Love's light messengers alone I--
31121,SONG.,Ere yet another evening takes
31122,SONG.,"Its farewell of the golden lakes,"
31123,SONG.,"She sees another envoy fly,"
31124,SONG.,"With the wished answer, thro' the sky."
31125,SONG.,
31126,SONG.,
31127,SONG.,SONG.
31128,SONG.,
31129,SONG.,
31130,SONG.,"Welcome sweet bird, thro' the sunny air winging,"
31131,SONG.,"Swift hast thou come o'er the far-shining sea,"
31132,SONG.,Like Seba's dove on thy snowy neck bringing
31133,SONG.,Love's written vows from my lover to me.
31134,SONG.,"Oh, in thy absence what hours did I number!--"
31135,SONG.,"Saying oft, ""Idle bird, how could he rest?"""
31136,SONG.,"But thou art come at last, take now thy slumber,"
31137,SONG.,And lull thee in dreams of all thou lov'st best.
31138,SONG.,
31139,SONG.,Yet dost thou droop--even now while I utter
31140,SONG.,"Love's happy welcome, thy pulse dies away;"
31141,SONG.,"Cheer thee, my bird--were it life's ebbing flutter."
31142,SONG.,"This fondling bosom should woo it to stay,"
31143,SONG.,But no--thou'rt dying--thy last task is over--
31144,SONG.,"Farewell, sweet martyr to Love and to me!"
31145,SONG.,"The smiles thou hast wakened by news from my lover,"
31146,SONG.,Will now all be turned into weeping for thee.
31147,SONG.,
31148,SONG.,*       *       *       *       *
31149,SONG.,
31150,SONG.,While thus this scene of song (their last
31151,SONG.,"For the sweet summer season) past,"
31152,SONG.,A few presiding nymphs whose care
31153,SONG.,"Watched over all invisibly,"
31154,SONG.,As do those guardian sprites of air
31155,SONG.,"Whose watch we feel but cannot see,"
31156,SONG.,"Had from the circle--scarcely missed,"
31157,SONG.,Ere they were sparkling there again--
31158,SONG.,Glided like fairies to assist
31159,SONG.,"Their handmaids on the moonlight plain,"
31160,SONG.,"Where, hid by intercepting shade"
31161,SONG.,"From the stray glance of curious eyes,"
31162,SONG.,A feast of fruits and wines was laid--
31163,SONG.,"Soon to shine out, a glad surprise!"
31164,SONG.,
31165,SONG.,"And now the moon, her ark of light"
31166,SONG.,"Steering thro' Heaven, as tho' she bore"
31167,SONG.,In safety thro' that deep of night
31168,SONG.,"Spirits of earth, the good, the bright,"
31169,SONG.,"To some remote immortal shore,"
31170,SONG.,"Had half-way sped her glorious way,"
31171,SONG.,When round reclined on hillocks green
31172,SONG.,"In groups beneath that tranquil ray,"
31173,SONG.,The Zeans at their feast were seen.
31174,SONG.,Gay was the picture--every maid
31175,SONG.,"Whom late the lighted scene displayed,"
31176,SONG.,Still in her fancy garb arrayed;--
31177,SONG.,"The Arabian pilgrim, smiling here"
31178,SONG.,Beside the nymph of India's sky;
31179,SONG.,While there the Mainiote mountaineer
31180,SONG.,"Whispered in young Minerva's ear,"
31181,SONG.,And urchin Love stood laughing by.
31182,SONG.,
31183,SONG.,"Meantime the elders round the board,"
31184,SONG.,"By mirth and wit themselves made young,"
31185,SONG.,"High cups of juice Zacynthian poured,"
31186,SONG.,And while the flask went round thus sung:--
31187,SONG.,
31188,SONG.,
31189,SONG.,SONG.
31190,SONG.,
31191,SONG.,
31192,SONG.,"Up with the sparkling brimmer,"
31193,SONG.,Up to the crystal rim;
31194,SONG.,Let not a moonbeam glimmer
31195,SONG.,'Twixt the flood and brim.
31196,SONG.,When hath the world set eyes on
31197,SONG.,"Aught to match this light,"
31198,SONG.,Which o'er our cup's horizon
31199,SONG.,Dawns in bumpers bright?
31200,SONG.,
31201,SONG.,Truth in a deep well lieth--
31202,SONG.,So the wise aver;
31203,SONG.,But Truth the fact denieth--
31204,SONG.,Water suits not her.
31205,SONG.,"No, her abode's in brimmers,"
31206,SONG.,Like this mighty cup--
31207,SONG.,"Waiting till we, good swimmers,"
31208,SONG.,Dive to bring her up.
31209,SONG.,
31210,SONG.,*       *       *       *       *
31211,SONG.,
31212,SONG.,"Thus circled round the song of glee,"
31213,SONG.,"And all was tuneful mirth the while,"
31214,SONG.,Save on the cheeks of some whose smile
31215,SONG.,"As fixt they gaze upon the sea,"
31216,SONG.,Turns into paleness suddenly!
31217,SONG.,What see they there? a bright blue light
31218,SONG.,That like a meteor gliding o'er
31219,SONG.,"The distant wave grows on the sight,"
31220,SONG.,As tho' 'twere winged to Zea's shore.
31221,SONG.,"To some, 'mong those who came to gaze,"
31222,SONG.,It seemed the night-light far away
31223,SONG.,Of some lone fisher by the blaze
31224,SONG.,Of pine torch luring on his prey;
31225,SONG.,"While others, as 'twixt awe and mirth"
31226,SONG.,"They breathed the blest Panaya's[27] name,"
31227,SONG.,Vowed that such light was not of earth
31228,SONG.,"But of that drear, ill-omen'd flame"
31229,SONG.,Which mariners see on sail or mast
31230,SONG.,When Death is coming in the blast.
31231,SONG.,"While marvelling thus they stood, a maid"
31232,SONG.,"Who sate apart with downcast eye,"
31233,SONG.,Not yet had like the rest surveyed
31234,SONG.,"That coming light which now was nigh,"
31235,SONG.,"Soon as it met her sight, with cry"
31236,SONG.,"Of pain-like joy, ""'Tis he! 'tis he!"""
31237,SONG.,"Loud she exclaimed, and hurrying by"
31238,SONG.,"The assembled throng, rushed towards the sea."
31239,SONG.,"At burst so wild, alarmed, amazed,"
31240,SONG.,All stood like statues mute and gazed
31241,SONG.,Into each other's eyes to seek
31242,SONG.,What meant such mood in maid so meek?
31243,SONG.,
31244,SONG.,"Till now, the tale was known to few,"
31245,SONG.,But now from lip to lip it flew:--
31246,SONG.,"A youth, the flower of all the band,"
31247,SONG.,"Who late had left this sunny shore,"
31248,SONG.,"When last he kist that maiden's hand,"
31249,SONG.,Lingering to kiss it o'er and o'er.
31250,SONG.,By his sad brow too plainly told
31251,SONG.,"The ill-omened thought which crost him then,"
31252,SONG.,"That once those hands should lose their hold,"
31253,SONG.,They ne'er would meet on earth again!
31254,SONG.,"In vain his mistress sad as he,"
31255,SONG.,But with a heart from Self as free
31256,SONG.,"As generous woman's only is,"
31257,SONG.,Veiled her own fears to banish his:--
31258,SONG.,"With frank rebuke but still more vain,"
31259,SONG.,Did a rough warrior who stood by
31260,SONG.,"Call to his mind this martial strain,"
31261,SONG.,"His favorite once, ere Beauty's eye"
31262,SONG.,Had taught his soldier-heart to sigh:--
31263,SONG.,
31264,SONG.,
31265,SONG.,SONG.
31266,SONG.,
31267,SONG.,
31268,SONG.,"March! nor heed those arms that hold thee,"
31269,SONG.,Tho' so fondly close they come;
31270,SONG.,Closer still will they enfold thee
31271,SONG.,When thou bring'st fresh laurels home.
31272,SONG.,Dost thou dote on woman's brow?
31273,SONG.,Dost thou live but in her breath?
31274,SONG.,March!--one hour of victory now
31275,SONG.,Wins thee woman's smile till death.

32859,LALLA ROOKH,
32860,LALLA ROOKH,
32861,LALLA ROOKH,"In the eleventh year of the reign of Aurungzebe, Abdalla, King of the"
32862,LALLA ROOKH,"Lesser Bucharia, a lineal descendant from the Great Zingis, having"
32863,LALLA ROOKH,"abdicated the throne in favor of his son, set out on a pilgrimage to the"
32864,LALLA ROOKH,"Shrine of the Prophet; and, passing into India through the delightful"
32865,LALLA ROOKH,"valley of Cashmere, rested for a short time at Delhi on his way. He was"
32866,LALLA ROOKH,"entertained by Aurungzebe in a style of magnificent hospitality, worthy"
32867,LALLA ROOKH,"alike of the visitor and the host, and was afterwards escorted with the"
32868,LALLA ROOKH,"same splendor to Surat, where he embarked for Arabia.[1] During the stay"
32869,LALLA ROOKH,"of the Royal Pilgrim at Delhi, a marriage was agreed upon between the"
32870,LALLA ROOKH,"Prince, his son, and the youngest daughter of the Emperor, LALLA ROOKH;"
32871,LALLA ROOKH,[2]--a Princess described by the poets of her time as more beautiful than
32872,LALLA ROOKH,"Leila,[3] Shirine,[4] Dewildé,[5] or any of those heroines whose names"
32873,LALLA ROOKH,and loves embellish the songs of Persia and Hindostan. It was intended
32874,LALLA ROOKH,"that the nuptials should be celebrated at Cashmere; where the young King,"
32875,LALLA ROOKH,"as soon as the cares of the empire would permit, was to meet, for the"
32876,LALLA ROOKH,"first time, his lovely bride, and, after a few months' repose in that"
32877,LALLA ROOKH,"enchanting valley, conduct her over the snowy hills into Bucharia."
32878,LALLA ROOKH,
32879,LALLA ROOKH,The day of LALLA ROOKH'S departure from Delhi was as splendid as sunshine
32880,LALLA ROOKH,and pageantry could make it. The bazaars and baths were all covered with
32881,LALLA ROOKH,the richest tapestry; hundreds of gilded barges upon the Jumna floated
32882,LALLA ROOKH,with their banners shining in the water; while through the streets groups
32883,LALLA ROOKH,"of beautiful children went strewing the most delicious flowers around, as"
32884,LALLA ROOKH,in that Persian festival called the Scattering of the Roses;[6] till
32885,LALLA ROOKH,every part of the city was as fragrant as if a caravan of musk from Khoten
32886,LALLA ROOKH,"had passed through it. The Princess, having taken leave of her kind"
32887,LALLA ROOKH,"father, who at parting hung a cornelian of Yemen round her neck, on which"
32888,LALLA ROOKH,"was inscribed a verse from the Koran, and having sent a considerable"
32889,LALLA ROOKH,"present to the Fakirs, who kept up the Perpetual Lamp in her sister's"
32890,LALLA ROOKH,"tomb, meekly ascended the palankeen prepared for her; and while Aurungzebe"
32891,LALLA ROOKH,"stood to take a last look from his balcony, the procession moved slowly on"
32892,LALLA ROOKH,the road to Lahore.
32893,LALLA ROOKH,
32894,LALLA ROOKH,Seldom had the Eastern world seen a cavalcade so superb. From the gardens
32895,LALLA ROOKH,"in the suburbs to the Imperial palace, it was one unbroken line of"
32896,LALLA ROOKH,"splendor. The gallant appearance of the Rajahs and Mogul lords,"
32897,LALLA ROOKH,"distinguished by those insignia of the Emperor's favor,[7] the feathers"
32898,LALLA ROOKH,"of the egret of Cashmere in their turbans, and the small silver-rimm'd"
32899,LALLA ROOKH,kettle-drums at the bows of their saddles;--the costly armor of their
32900,LALLA ROOKH,"cavaliers, who vied, on this occasion, with the guards of the great Keder"
32901,LALLA ROOKH,"Khan,[8] in the brightness of their silver battle-axes and the massiness"
32902,LALLA ROOKH,of their maces of gold;--the glittering of the gilt pine-apple[9] on the
32903,LALLA ROOKH,"tops of the palankeens;--the embroidered trappings of the elephants,"
32904,LALLA ROOKH,"bearing on their backs small turrets, in the shape of little antique"
32905,LALLA ROOKH,"temples, within which the Ladies of LALLA ROOKH lay as it were enshrined;"
32906,LALLA ROOKH,"--the rose-colored veils of the Princess's own sumptuous litter,[10] at"
32907,LALLA ROOKH,the front of which a fair young female slave sat fanning her through the
32908,LALLA ROOKH,"curtains, with feathers of the Argus pheasant's wing;[11]--and the lovely"
32909,LALLA ROOKH,"troop of Tartarian and Cashmerian maids of honor, whom the young King had"
32910,LALLA ROOKH,"sent to accompany his bride, and who rode on each side of the litter, upon"
32911,LALLA ROOKH,"small Arabian horses;--all was brilliant, tasteful, and magnificent, and"
32912,LALLA ROOKH,"pleased even the critical and fastidious FADLADEEN, Great Nazir or"
32913,LALLA ROOKH,"Chamberlain of the Haram, who was borne in his palankeen immediately after"
32914,LALLA ROOKH,"the Princess, and considered himself not the least important personage of"
32915,LALLA ROOKH,the pageant.
32916,LALLA ROOKH,
32917,LALLA ROOKH,"FADLADEEN was a judge of everything,--from the pencilling of a"
32918,LALLA ROOKH,Circassian's eyelids to the deepest questions of science and literature;
32919,LALLA ROOKH,from the mixture of a conserve of rose-leaves to the composition of an
32920,LALLA ROOKH,epic poem: and such influence had his opinion upon the various tastes of
32921,LALLA ROOKH,"the day, that all the cooks and poets of Delhi stood in awe of him. His"
32922,LALLA ROOKH,"political conduct and opinions were founded upon that line of Sadi,--"
32923,LALLA ROOKH,"""Should the Prince at noon-day say, It is night, declare that you behold"
32924,LALLA ROOKH,"the moon and stars.""--And his zeal for religion, of which Aurungzebe was a"
32925,LALLA ROOKH,"munificent protector,[12] was about as disinterested as that of the"
32926,LALLA ROOKH,goldsmith who fell in love with the diamond eyes of the idol of
32927,LALLA ROOKH,Jaghernaut.[13]
32928,LALLA ROOKH,
32929,LALLA ROOKH,"During the first days of their journey, LALLA ROOKH, who had passed all"
32930,LALLA ROOKH,"her life within the shadow of the Royal Gardens of Delhi,[14] found"
32931,LALLA ROOKH,enough in the beauty of the scenery through which they passed to interest
32932,LALLA ROOKH,"her mind, and delight her imagination; and when at evening or in the heat"
32933,LALLA ROOKH,of the day they turned off from the high road to those retired and
32934,LALLA ROOKH,"romantic places which had been selected for her encampments,--sometimes,"
32935,LALLA ROOKH,"on the banks of a small rivulet, as clear as the waters of the Lake of"
32936,LALLA ROOKH,"Pearl;[15] sometimes under the sacred shade of a Banyan tree, from which"
32937,LALLA ROOKH,the view opened upon a glade covered with antelopes; and often in those
32938,LALLA ROOKH,"hidden, embowered spots, described by one from the Isles of the West,"
32939,LALLA ROOKH,"[16]as ""places of melancholy, delight, and safety, where all the company"
32940,LALLA ROOKH,"around was wild peacocks and turtle-doves;""--she felt a charm in these"
32941,LALLA ROOKH,"scenes, so lovely and so new to her, which, for a time, made her"
32942,LALLA ROOKH,"indifferent to every other amusement. But LALLA ROOKH was young, and the"
32943,LALLA ROOKH,young love variety; nor could the conversation of her Ladies and the Great
32944,LALLA ROOKH,"Chamberlain, FADLADEEN,(the only persons, of course, admitted to her"
32945,LALLA ROOKH,"pavilion.) sufficiently enliven those many vacant hours, which were"
32946,LALLA ROOKH,devoted neither to the pillow nor the palankeen. There was a little
32947,LALLA ROOKH,"Persian slave who sung sweetly to the Vina, and who, now and then, lulled"
32948,LALLA ROOKH,"the Princess to sleep with the ancient ditties of her country, about the"
32949,LALLA ROOKH,"loves of Wavnak and Ezra,[17] the fair-haired Zal and his mistress"
32950,LALLA ROOKH,"Rodahver,[18] not forgetting the combat of Rustam with the terrible White"
32951,LALLA ROOKH,Demon.[19] At other times she was amused by those graceful dancing-girls
32952,LALLA ROOKH,"of Delhi, who had been permitted by the Bramins of the Great Pagoda to"
32953,LALLA ROOKH,"attend her, much to the horror of the good Mussulman FADLADEEN, who could"
32954,LALLA ROOKH,"see nothing graceful or agreeable in idolaters, and to whom the very"
32955,LALLA ROOKH,tinkling of their golden anklets[20] was an abomination.
32956,LALLA ROOKH,
32957,LALLA ROOKH,But these and many other diversions were repeated till they lost all their
32958,LALLA ROOKH,"charm, and the nights and noon-days were beginning to move heavily, when,"
32959,LALLA ROOKH,"at length, it was recollected that, among the attendants sent by the"
32960,LALLA ROOKH,"bridegroom, was a young poet of Cashmere, much celebrated throughout the"
32961,LALLA ROOKH,"Valley for his manner of reciting the Stories of the East, on whom his"
32962,LALLA ROOKH,Royal Master had conferred the privilege of being admitted to the pavilion
32963,LALLA ROOKH,"of the Princess, that he might help to beguile the tediousness of the"
32964,LALLA ROOKH,"journey by some of his most agreeable recitals. At the mention of a poet,"
32965,LALLA ROOKH,"FADLADEEN elevated his critical eyebrows, and, having refreshed his"
32966,LALLA ROOKH,faculties with a dose of that delicious opium which is distilled from the
32967,LALLA ROOKH,"black poppy of the Thebais, gave orders for the minstrel to be forthwith"
32968,LALLA ROOKH,introduced into the presence.
32969,LALLA ROOKH,
32970,LALLA ROOKH,"The Princess, who had once in her life seen a poet from behind the screens"
32971,LALLA ROOKH,"of gauze in her father's hall, and had conceived from that specimen no"
32972,LALLA ROOKH,"very favorable ideas of the Caste, expected but little in this new"
32973,LALLA ROOKH,"exhibition to interest her;--she felt inclined, however, to alter her"
32974,LALLA ROOKH,opinion on the very first appearance of FERAMORZ. He was a youth about
32975,LALLA ROOKH,"LALLA ROOKH'S own age, and graceful as that idol of women,"
32976,LALLA ROOKH,"Crishna,[21]--such as he appears to their young imaginations, heroic,"
32977,LALLA ROOKH,"beautiful, breathing music from his very eyes, and exalting the religion"
32978,LALLA ROOKH,"of his worshippers into love. His dress was simple, yet not without some"
32979,LALLA ROOKH,marks of costliness; and the Ladies of the Princess were not long in
32980,LALLA ROOKH,"discovering that the cloth, which encircled his high Tartarian cap, was of"
32981,LALLA ROOKH,the most delicate kind that the shawl-goats of Tibet supply.[22] Here and
32982,LALLA ROOKH,"there, too, over his vest, which was confined by a flowered girdle of"
32983,LALLA ROOKH,"Kashan, hung strings of fine pearl, disposed with an air of studied"
32984,LALLA ROOKH,negligence;--nor did the exquisite embroidery of his sandals escape the
32985,LALLA ROOKH,"observation of these fair critics; who, however they might give way to"
32986,LALLA ROOKH,"FADLADEEN upon the unimportant topics of religion and government, had the"
32987,LALLA ROOKH,spirit of martyrs in everything relating to such momentous matters as
32988,LALLA ROOKH,jewels and embroidery.
32989,LALLA ROOKH,
32990,LALLA ROOKH,"For the purpose of relieving the pauses of recitation by music, the young"
32991,LALLA ROOKH,"Cashmerian held in his hand a kitar;--such as, in old times, the Arab"
32992,LALLA ROOKH,maids of the West used to listen to by moonlight in the gardens of the
32993,LALLA ROOKH,"Alhambra--and, having premised, with much humility, that the story he was"
32994,LALLA ROOKH,about to relate was founded on the adventures of that Veiled Prophet of
32995,LALLA ROOKH,"Khorassan,[23] who, in the year of the Hegira 163, created such alarm"
32996,LALLA ROOKH,"throughout the Eastern Empire, made an obeisance to the Princess, and thus"
32997,LALLA ROOKH,began:--

33003,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In that delightful Province of the Sun,"
33004,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The first of Persian lands he shines upon.
33005,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Where all the loveliest children of his beam,"
33006,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Flowerets and fruits, blush over every stream,[25]"
33007,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And, fairest of all streams, the MURGA roves"
33008,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Among MEROU'S[26] bright palaces and groves;--
33009,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"There on that throne, to which the blind belief"
33010,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of millions raised him, sat the Prophet-Chief,"
33011,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The Great MOKANNA. O'er his features hung
33012,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The Veil, the Silver Veil, which he had flung"
33013,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In mercy there, to hide from mortal sight"
33014,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"His dazzling brow, till man could bear its light."
33015,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"For, far less luminous, his votaries said,"
33016,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Were even the gleams, miraculously shed"
33017,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"O'er MOUSSA'S[27] cheek, when down the Mount he trod"
33018,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],All glowing from the presence of his God!
33019,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33020,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"On either side, with ready hearts and hands,"
33021,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],His chosen guard of bold Believers stands;
33022,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Young fire-eyed disputants, who deem their swords,"
33023,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"On points of faith, more eloquent than words;"
33024,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33025,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And such their zeal, there's not a youth with brand"
33026,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Uplifted there, but at the Chief's command,"
33027,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Would make his own devoted heart its sheath,"
33028,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And bless the lips that doomed so dear a death!
33029,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In hatred to the Caliph's hue of night,[28]"
33030,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Their vesture, helms and all, is snowy white;"
33031,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Their weapons various--some equipt for speed,"
33032,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],With javelins of the light Kathaian reed;[29]
33033,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Or bows of buffalo horn and shining quivers
33034,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Filled with the stems[30]
33035,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],that bloom on IRAN'S rivers;[31]
33036,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"While some, for war's more terrible attacks,"
33037,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Wield the huge mace and ponderous battle-axe;
33038,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And as they wave aloft in morning's beam
33039,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The milk-white plumage of their helms, they seem"
33040,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Like a chenar-tree grove[32] when winter throws
33041,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],O'er all its tufted heads his feathery snows.
33042,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33043,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Between the porphyry pillars that uphold
33044,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The rich moresque-work of the roof of gold,"
33045,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Aloft the Haram's curtained galleries rise,"
33046,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Where thro' the silken net-work, glancing eyes,"
33047,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"From time to time, like sudden gleams that glow"
33048,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Thro' autumn clouds, shine o'er the pomp below.--"
33049,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"What impious tongue, ye blushing saints, would dare"
33050,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],To hint that aught but Heaven hath placed you there?
33051,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Or that the loves of this light world could bind,"
33052,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In their gross chain, your Prophet's soaring mind?"
33053,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],No--wrongful thought!--commissioned from above
33054,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To people Eden's bowers with shapes of love,"
33055,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"(Creatures so bright, that the same lips and eyes"
33056,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"They wear on earth will serve in Paradise,)"
33057,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"There to recline among Heaven's native maids,"
33058,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And crown the Elect with bliss that never fades--
33059,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Well hath the Prophet-Chief his bidding done;
33060,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And every beauteous race beneath the sun,"
33061,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"From those who kneel at BRAHMA'S burning fount,[33]"
33062,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],To the fresh nymphs bounding o'er YEMEN'S mounts;
33063,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"From PERSIA'S eyes of full and fawnlike ray,"
33064,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To the small, half-shut glances of KATHAY;[34]"
33065,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And GEORGIA'S bloom, and AZAB'S darker smiles,"
33066,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And the gold ringlets of the Western Isles;
33067,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"All, all are there;--each Land its flower hath given,"
33068,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],To form that fair young Nursery for Heaven!
33069,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33070,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But why this pageant now? this armed array?
33071,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],What triumph crowds the rich Divan to-day
33072,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With turbaned heads of every hue and race,"
33073,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Bowing before that veiled and awful face,"
33074,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Like tulip-beds,[35] of different shape and dyes,"
33075,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Bending beneath the invisible West-wind's sighs!
33076,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],What new-made mystery now for Faith to sign
33077,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And blood to seal, as genuine and divine,"
33078,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],What dazzling mimicry of God's own power
33079,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Hath the bold Prophet planned to grace this hour?
33080,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33081,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Not such the pageant now, tho' not less proud;"
33082,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Yon warrior youth advancing from the crowd
33083,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With silver bow, with belt of broidered crape"
33084,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And fur-bound bonnet of Bucharian shape.[36]
33085,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"So fiercely beautiful in form and eye,"
33086,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Like war's wild planet in a summer sky;
33087,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That youth to-day,--a proselyte, worth hordes"
33088,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of cooler spirits and less practised swords,--"
33089,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Is come to join, all bravery and belief,"
33090,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The creed and standard of the heaven-sent Chief.
33091,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33092,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Tho' few his years, the West already knows"
33093,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Young AZIM'S fame;--beyond the Olympian snows
33094,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Ere manhood darkened o'er his downy cheek,"
33095,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"O'erwhelmed in fight and captive to the Greek,[37]"
33096,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"He lingered there, till peace dissolved his chains;--"
33097,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Oh! who could even in bondage tread the plains
33098,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of glorious GREECE nor feel his spirit rise
33099,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Kindling within him? who with heart and eyes
33100,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Could walk where Liberty had been nor see
33101,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The shining foot-prints of her Deity,"
33102,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Nor feel those god-like breathings in the air
33103,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Which mutely told her spirit had been there?
33104,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Not he, that youthful warrior,--no, too well"
33105,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],For his soul's quiet worked the awakening spell;
33106,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And now, returning to his own dear land,"
33107,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Full of those dreams of good that, vainly grand,"
33108,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Haunt the young heart,--proud views of human-kind,"
33109,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of men to Gods exalted and refined,--"

33356,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of poesy and music breathed around,"
33357,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Together picturing to her mind and ear
33358,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The glories of that heaven, her destined sphere,"
33359,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Where all was pure, where every stain that lay"
33360,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Upon the spirit's light should pass away,"
33361,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And realizing more than youthful love
33362,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"E'er wisht or dreamed, she should for ever rove"
33363,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Thro' fields of fragrance by her AZIM'S side,"
33364,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"His own blest, purified, eternal bride!--"
33365,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"T was from a scene, a witching trance like this,"
33366,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"He hurried her away, yet breathing bliss,"
33367,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],To the dim charnel-house;--thro' all its steams
33368,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of damp and death led only by those gleams
33369,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Which foul Corruption lights, as with design"
33370,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],To show the gay and proud _she_ too can shine--
33371,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And passing on thro' upright ranks of Dead
33372,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Which to the maiden, doubly crazed by dread,"
33373,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Seemed, thro' the bluish death-light round them cast,"
33374,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],To move their lips in mutterings as she past--
33375,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"There in that awful place, when each had quaft"
33376,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And pledged in silence such a fearful draught,"
33377,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Such--oh! the look and taste of that red bowl
33378,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Will haunt her till she dies--he bound her soul
33379,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"By a dark oath, in hell's own language framed,"
33380,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Never, while earth his mystic presence claimed,"
33381,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"While the blue arch of day hung o'er them both,"
33382,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Never, by that all-imprecating oath,"
33383,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],In joy or sorrow from his side to sever.--
33384,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"She swore and the wide charnel echoed ""Never, never!"""
33385,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33386,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"From that dread hour, entirely, wildly given"
33387,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To him and--she believed, lost maid!--to heaven;"
33388,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Her brain, her heart, her passions all inflamed,"
33389,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"How proud she stood, when in full Haram named"
33390,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The Priestess of the Faith!--how flasht her eyes
33391,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With light, alas, that was not of the skies,"
33392,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],When round in trances only less than hers
33393,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"She saw the Haram kneel, her prostrate worshippers."
33394,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Well might MOKANNA think that form alone
33395,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Had spells enough to make the world his own:--
33396,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Light, lovely limbs to which the spirit's play"
33397,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Gave motion, airy as the dancing spray,"
33398,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],When from its stem the small bird wings away;
33399,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Lips in whose rosy labyrinth when she smiled
33400,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The soul was lost, and blushes, swift and wild"
33401,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As are the momentary meteors sent
33402,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Across the uncalm but beauteous firmament.
33403,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And then her look--oh! where's the heart so wise
33404,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Could unbewildered meet those matchless eyes?
33405,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Quick, restless, strange, but exquisite withal,"
33406,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Like those of angels just before their fall;
33407,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Now shadowed with the shames of earth--now crost
33408,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],By glimpses of the Heaven her heart had lost;
33409,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In every glance there broke without control,"
33410,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The flashes of a bright but troubled soul,"
33411,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Where sensibility still wildly played
33412,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Like lightning round the ruins it had made!
33413,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33414,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And such was now young ZELICA--so changed
33415,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],From her who some years since delighted ranged
33416,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The almond groves that shade BOKHARA'S tide
33417,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],All life and bliss with AZIM by her side!
33418,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"So altered was she now, this festal day,"
33419,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"When, mid the proud Divan's dazzling array,"
33420,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The vision of that Youth whom she had loved,"
33421,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Had wept as dead, before her breathed and moved;--"
33422,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"When--bright, she thought, as if from Eden's track"
33423,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But half-way trodden, he had wandered back"
33424,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Again to earth, glistening with Eden's light--"
33425,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Her beauteous AZIM shone before her sight.
33426,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33427,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"O Reason! who shall say what spells renew,"
33428,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"When least we look for it, thy broken clew!"
33429,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Thro' what small vistas o'er the darkened brain
33430,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Thy intellectual day-beam bursts again;
33431,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And how like forts to which beleaguerers win
33432,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Unhoped-for entrance thro' some friend within,"
33433,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"One clear idea, wakened in the breast"
33434,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"By memory's magic, lets in all the rest."
33435,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Would it were thus, unhappy girl, with thee!"
33436,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But tho' light came, it came but partially;"
33437,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Enough to show the maze, in which thy sense"
33438,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Wandered about,--but not to guide it thence;"
33439,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Enough to glimmer o'er the yawning wave,"
33440,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But not to point the harbor which might save.
33441,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Hours of delight and peace, long left behind,"
33442,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],With that dear form came rushing o'er her mind;
33443,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But, oh! to think how deep her soul had gone"
33444,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],In shame and falsehood since those moments shone;
33445,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And then her oath--_there_ madness lay again,"
33446,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And shuddering, back she sunk into her chain"
33447,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of mental darkness, as if blest to flee"
33448,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],From light whose every glimpse was agony!
33449,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Yet _one_ relief this glance of former years
33450,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Brought mingled with its pain,--tears, floods of tears,"
33451,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Long frozen at her heart, but now like rills"
33452,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Let loose in spring-time from the snowy hills,"
33453,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And gushing warm after a sleep of frost,"
33454,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Thro' valleys where their flow had long been lost.
33455,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33456,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Sad and subdued, for the first time her frame"
33457,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Trembled with horror when the summons came
33458,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"(A summons proud and rare, which all but she,"
33459,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And she, till now, had heard with ecstasy,)"
33460,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To meet MOKANNA at his place of prayer,"
33461,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],A garden oratory cool and fair
33462,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"By the stream's side, where still at close of day"
33463,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The Prophet of the Veil retired to pray,"
33464,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Sometimes alone--but oftener far with one,"
33465,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],One chosen nymph to share his orison.
33466,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33467,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of late none found such favor in his sight
33468,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"As the young Priestess; and tho', since that night"
33469,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],When the death-cavorns echoed every tone
33470,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of the dire oath that made her all his own,"
33471,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The Impostor sure of his infatuate prize
33472,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Had more than once thrown off his soul's disguise,"
33473,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And uttered such unheavenly, monstrous things,"
33474,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As even across the desperate wanderings
33475,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of a weak intellect, whose lamp was out,"
33476,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Threw startling shadows of dismay and doubt;--
33477,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Yet zeal, ambition, her tremendous vow,"
33478,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The thought, still haunting her, of that bright brow,"
33479,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Whose blaze, as yet from mortal eye concealed,"
33480,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Would soon, proud triumph! be to her revealed,"
33481,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To her alone;--and then the hope, most dear,"
33482,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Most wild of all, that her transgression here"
33483,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Was but a passage thro' earth's grosser fire,"
33484,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"From which the spirit would at last aspire,"
33485,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Even purer than before,--as perfumes rise"
33486,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Thro' flame and smoke, most welcome to the skies--"
33487,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And that when AZIM's fond, divine embrace"
33488,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Should circle her in heaven, no darkening trace"
33489,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Would on that bosom he once loved remain.
33490,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But all be bright, be pure, be _his_ again!--"
33491,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"These were the wildering dreams, whose curst deceit"
33492,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Had chained her soul beneath the tempter's feet,"
33493,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And made her think even damning falsehood sweet.
33494,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But now that Shape, which had appalled her view,"
33495,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That Semblance--oh how terrible, if true!"
33496,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Which came across her frenzy's full career
33497,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With shock of consciousness, cold, deep, severe."
33498,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As when in northern seas at midnight dark
33499,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"An isle of ice encounters some swift bark,"
33500,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And startling all its wretches from their sleep
33501,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],By one cold impulse hurls them to the deep;--
33502,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"So came that shock not frenzy's self could bear,"
33503,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And waking up each long-lulled image there,"
33504,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But checkt her headlong soul to sink it in despair!
33505,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33506,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Wan and dejected, thro' the evening dusk,"
33507,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"She now went slowly to that small kiosk,"
33508,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Where, pondering alone his impious schemes,"
33509,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],MOKANNA waited her--too wrapt in dreams
33510,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of the fair-ripening future's rich success,"
33511,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To heed the sorrow, pale and spiritless,"
33512,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That sat upon his victim's downcast brow,"
33513,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Or mark how slow her step, how altered now"
33514,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"From the quick, ardent Priestess, whose light bound"
33515,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Came like a spirit's o'er the unechoing ground,--"
33516,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],From that wild ZELICA whose every glance
33517,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Was thrilling fire, whose every thought a trance!"
33518,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33519,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Upon his couch the Veiled MOKANNA lay,"
33520,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"While lamps around--not such as lend their ray,"
33521,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Glimmering and cold, to those who nightly pray"
33522,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In holy KOOM,[45] or MECCA'S dim arcades,--"
33523,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But brilliant, soft, such lights as lovely maids."
33524,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Look loveliest in, shed their luxurious glow"
33525,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Upon his mystic Veil's white glittering flow.
33526,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Beside him, 'stead of beads and books of prayer,"
33527,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Which the world fondly thought he mused on there,"
33528,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Stood Vases, filled with KISIIMEE'S[46] golden wine,"
33529,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And the red weepings of the SHIRAZ vine;
33530,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of which his curtained lips full many a draught
33531,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Took zealously, as if each drop they quaft"
33532,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Like ZEMZEM'S Spring of Holiness[47] had power
33533,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],To freshen the soul's virtues into flower!
33534,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And still he drank and pondered--nor could see
33535,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The approaching maid, so deep his revery;"
33536,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],At length with fiendish laugh like that which broke
33537,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],From EBLIS at the Fall of Man he spoke:--
33538,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Yes, ye vile race, for hell's amusement given,"
33539,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Too mean for earth, yet claiming kin with heaven;"
33540,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""God's images, forsooth!--such gods as he"
33541,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Whom INDIA serves, the monkey deity;[48]"
33542,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Ye creatures of a breath, proud things of clay,"
33543,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""To whom if LUCIFER, as gran-dams say,"
33544,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Refused tho' at the forfeit of heaven's light"
33545,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""To bend in worship, LUCIFER was right!"
33546,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Soon shall I plant this foot upon the neck"
33547,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Of your foul race and without fear or check,"
33548,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Luxuriating in hate, avenge my shame,"
33549,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""My deep-felt, long-nurst loathing of man's name!--"
33550,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Soon at the head of myriads, blind and fierce"
33551,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""As hooded falcons, thro' the universe"
33552,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""I'll sweep my darkening, desolating way,"
33553,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Weak man my instrument, curst man my prey!"
33554,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33555,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Ye wise, ye learned, who grope your dull way on"
33556,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""By the dim twinkling gleams of ages gone,"
33557,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Like superstitious thieves who think the light"
33558,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""From dead men's marrow guides them best at night[49]--"
33559,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Ye shall have honors--wealth--yes, Sages, yes--"
33560,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""I know, grave fools, your wisdom's nothingness;"
33561,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Undazzled it can track yon starry sphere,"
33562,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""But a gilt stick, a bauble blinds it here."
33563,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""How I shall laugh, when trumpeted along"
33564,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""In lying speech and still more lying song,"
33565,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""By these learned slaves, the meanest of the throng;"
33566,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Their wits brought up, their wisdom shrunk so small,"
33567,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""A sceptre's puny point can wield it all!"
33568,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
33569,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Ye too, believers of incredible creeds,"
33570,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Whose faith enshrines the monsters which it breeds;"
33571,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Who, bolder even than NEMROD, think to rise"
33572,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""By nonsense heapt on nonsense to the skies;"
33573,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Ye shall have miracles, ay, sound ones too,"
33574,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Seen, heard, attested, everything--but true."
33575,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Your preaching zealots too inspired to seek"
33576,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""One grace of meaning for the things they speak:"
33577,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Your martyrs ready to shed out their blood,"
33578,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""For truths too heavenly to be understood;"
33579,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""And your State Priests, sole venders of the lore,"
33580,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""That works salvation;--as, on AVA'S shore,"
33581,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Where none _but_ priests are privileged to trade"
33582,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""In that best marble of which Gods are made[50];"
33583,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""They shall have mysteries--ay precious stuff"
33584,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""For knaves to thrive by--mysteries enough;"
33585,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Dark, tangled doctrines, dark as fraud can weave,"
33586,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Which simple votaries shall on trust receive,"
33587,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""While craftier feign belief till they believe."
33588,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""A Heaven too ye must have, ye lords of dust,--"
33589,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""A splendid Paradise,--pure souls, ye must:"
33590,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""That Prophet ill sustains his holy call,"
33591,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Who finds not heavens to suit the tastes of all;"
33592,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Houris for boys, omniscience for sages,"
33593,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""And wings and glories for all ranks and ages."

33828,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Yamtcheou[53] having been sent on previously for the purpose. On each
33829,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"side of the green alley, which led to the Royal Pavilion, artificial"
33830,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"sceneries of bamboo-work were erected, representing arches, minarets,"
33831,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"towers, from which hung thousands of silken lanterns painted by the most"
33832,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],delicate pencils of Canton.--Nothing could be more beautiful than the
33833,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],leaves of the mango-trees and acacias shining in the light of the
33834,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],bamboo-scenery which shed a lustre round as soft as that of the nights of

33932,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],In broken rainbows a fresh fountain plays
33933,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],High as the enamelled cupola which towers
33934,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],All rich with Arabesques of gold and flowers:
33935,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And the mosaic floor beneath shines thro'

34066,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As they were captives to the King of Flowers;[71]
34067,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And some disporting round, unlinkt and free,"
34068,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Who seemed to mock their sisters' slavery;
34069,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And round and round them still in wheeling flight
34070,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Went like gay moths about a lamp at night;
34071,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"While others waked, as gracefully along"
34072,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Their feet kept time, the very soul of song"
34073,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"From psaltery, pipe, and lutes of heavenly thrill,"
34074,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Or their own youthful voices heavenlier still.
34075,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And now they come, now pass before his eye,"
34076,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Forms such as Nature moulds when she would vie
34077,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],With Fancy's pencil and give birth to things
34078,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Lovely beyond its fairest picturings.
34079,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Awhile they dance before him, then divide,"
34080,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Breaking like rosy clouds at eventide
34081,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Around the rich pavilion of the sun,--"
34082,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Till silently dispersing, one by one,"
34083,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Thro' many a path that from the chamber leads
34084,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To gardens, terraces and moonlight meads,"
34085,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Their distant laughter comes upon the wind,"
34086,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And but one trembling nymph remains behind,--"
34087,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Beckoning them back in vain--for they are gone
34088,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And she is left in all that light alone;
34089,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"No veil to curtain o'er her beauteous brow,"
34090,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],In its young bashfulness more beauteous now;
34091,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But a light golden chain-work round her hair,[72]"
34092,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Such as the maids of YEZD and SHIRAS wear,[73]"
34093,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],From which on either side gracefully hung
34094,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"A golden amulet in the Arab tongue,"
34095,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Engraven o'er with some immortal line
34096,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],From Holy Writ or bard scarce less divine;
34097,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"While her left hand, as shrinkingly she stood,"
34098,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Held a small lute of gold and sandal-wood,"
34099,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Which once or twice she touched with hurried strain,"
34100,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Then took her trembling fingers off again.
34101,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But when at length a timid glance she stole
34102,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"At AZIM, the sweet gravity of soul"
34103,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"She saw thro' all his features calmed her fear,"
34104,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And like a half-tamed antelope more near,"
34105,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Tho' shrinking still, she came;--then sat her down"
34106,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Upon a musnud's[74] edge, and, bolder grown."
34107,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],In the pathetic mode of ISFAHAN[75]
34108,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Touched a preluding strain and thus began:--
34109,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34110,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"There's a bower of roses by BENDEMEER's[76] stream,"
34111,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And the nightingale sings round it all the day long;
34112,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In the time of my childhood 'twas like a sweet dream,"
34113,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],To sit in the roses and hear the bird's song.
34114,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34115,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That bower and its music, I never forget,"
34116,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But oft when alone in the bloom of the year
34117,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],I think--is the nightingale singing there yet?
34118,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Are the roses still bright by the calm BENDEMEER?
34119,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34120,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"No, the roses soon withered that hung o'er the wave,"
34121,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But some blossoms were gathered while freshly they shone.
34122,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And a dew was distilled from their flowers that gave
34123,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],All the fragrance of summer when summer was gone.
34124,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34125,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Thus memory draws from delight ere it dies
34126,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],An essence that breathes of it many a year;
34127,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Thus bright to my soul, as 'twas then to my eyes,"
34128,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Is that bower on the banks of the calm BENDEMEER!
34129,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34130,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Poor maiden!"" thought the youth, ""if thou wert sent"
34131,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""With thy soft lute and beauty's blandishment"
34132,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""To wake unholy wishes in this heart,"
34133,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Or tempt its truth, thou little know'st the art."
34134,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""For tho' thy lips should sweetly counsel wrong,"
34135,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Those vestal eyes would disavow its song."
34136,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""But thou hast breathed such purity, thy lay"
34137,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Returns so fondly to youth's virtuous day,"
34138,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""And leads thy soul--if e'er it wandered thence--"
34139,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""So gently back to its first innocence,"
34140,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""That I would sooner stop the unchained dove,"
34141,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""When swift returning to its home of love,"
34142,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""And round its snowy wing new fetters twine."
34143,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Than turn from virtue one pure wish of thine!"""
34144,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34145,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Scarce had this feeling past, when sparkling thro'"
34146,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The gently open'd curtains of light blue
34147,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That veiled the breezy casement, countless eyes"
34148,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Peeping like stars thro' the blue evening skies,"
34149,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Looked laughing in as if to mock the pair
34150,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],That sat so still and melancholy there:--
34151,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And now the curtains fly apart and in
34152,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],From the cool air mid showers of jessamine
34153,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Which those without fling after them in play,"
34154,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Two lightsome maidens spring,--lightsome as they"
34155,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Who live in the air on odors,--and around"
34156,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The bright saloon, scarce conscious of the ground,"
34157,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Chase one another in a varying dance
34158,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of mirth and languor, coyness and advance,"
34159,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Too eloquently like love's warm pursuit:--
34160,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],While she who sung so gently to the lute
34161,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Her dream of home steals timidly away,"
34162,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Shrinking as violets do in summer's ray,--"
34163,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But takes with her from AZIM'S heart that sigh
34164,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],We sometimes give to forms that pass us by
34165,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In the world's crowd, too lovely to remain,"
34166,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Creatures of light we never see again!
34167,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34168,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Around the white necks of the nymphs who danced
34169,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Hung carcanets of orient gems that glanced
34170,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],More brilliant than the sea-glass glittering o'er
34171,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The hills of crystal on the Caspian shore;[77]
34172,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"While from their long, dark tresses, in a fall"
34173,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of curls descending, bells as musical"
34174,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As those that on the golden-shafted trees
34175,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of EDEN shake in the eternal breeze,[78]"
34176,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Rung round their steps, at every bound more sweet."
34177,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As 'twere the ecstatic language of their feet.
34178,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"At length the chase was o'er, and they stood wreathed"
34179,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Within each other's arms; while soft there breathed
34180,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Thro' the cool casement, mingled with the sighs"
34181,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of moonlight flowers, music that seemed to rise"
34182,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"From some still lake, so liquidly it rose;"
34183,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And as it swelled again at each faint close
34184,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The ear could track thro' all that maze of chords
34185,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And young sweet voices these impassioned words:--
34186,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34187,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],A SPIRIT there is whose fragrant sigh
34188,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Is burning now thro' earth and air;
34189,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Where cheeks are blushing the Spirit is nigh,"
34190,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Where lips are meeting the Spirit is there!
34191,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34192,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"His breath is the soul of flowers like these,"
34193,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And his floating eyes--oh! they resemble[79]
34194,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Blue water-lilies,[80] when the breeze"
34195,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Is making the stream around them tremble.
34196,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34197,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Hail to thee, hail to thee, kindling power!"
34198,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Spirit of Love, Spirit of Bliss!"
34199,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Thy holiest time is the moonlight hour,"
34200,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And there never was moonlight so sweet as this.
34201,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34202,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],By the fair and brave
34203,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Who blushing unite,"
34204,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Like the sun and wave,"
34205,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],When they meet at night;
34206,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34207,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],By the tear that shows
34208,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"When passion is nigh,"
34209,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As the rain-drop flows
34210,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],From the heat of the sky;
34211,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34212,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],By the first love-beat
34213,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of the youthful heart,"
34214,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"By the bliss to meet,"
34215,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And the pain to part;
34216,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34217,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],By all that thou hast
34218,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To mortals given,"
34219,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Which--oh, could it last,"
34220,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],This earth were heaven!
34221,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34222,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"We call thee thither, entrancing Power!"
34223,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Spirit of Love! Spirit of Bliss!
34224,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Thy holiest time is the moonlight hour,"
34225,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And there never was moonlight so sweet as this.
34226,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34227,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Impatient of a scene whose luxuries stole,"
34228,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Spite of himself, too deep into his soul,"
34229,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And where, midst all that the young heart loves most,"
34230,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Flowers, music, smiles, to yield was to be lost,"
34231,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The youth had started up and turned away
34232,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],From the light nymphs and their luxurious lay
34233,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To muse upon the pictures that hung round,--[81]"
34234,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Bright images, that spoke without a sound,"
34235,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And views like vistas into fairy ground.
34236,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But here again new spells came o'er his sense:--
34237,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],All that the pencil's mute omnipotence
34238,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Could call up into life, of soft and fair,"
34239,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of fond and passionate, was glowing there;"
34240,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Nor yet too warm, but touched with that fine art"
34241,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Which paints of pleasure but the purer part;
34242,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Which knows even Beauty when half-veiled is best,--"
34243,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Like her own radiant planet of the west,"
34244,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Whose orb when half retired looks loveliest.[82]
34245,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"_There_ hung the history of the Genii-King,"
34246,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Traced thro' each gay, voluptuous wandering"
34247,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With her from SABA'S bowers, in whose bright eyes"
34248,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],He read that to be blest is to be wise;--
34249,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],_Here_ fond ZULEIKA woos with open arms[83]
34250,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The Hebrew boy who flies from her young charms,"
34251,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Yet flying turns to gaze and half undone
34252,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Wishes that Heaven and she could _both_ be won;
34253,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And here MOHAMMED born for love and guile
34254,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Forgets the Koran in his MARY'S smile;--
34255,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Then beckons some kind angel from above
34256,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],With a new text to consecrate their love.[84]
34257,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34258,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With rapid step, yet pleased and lingering eye,"
34259,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Did the youth pass these pictured stories by,"
34260,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And hastened to a casement where the light
34261,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of the calm moon came in and freshly bright
34262,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The fields without were seen sleeping as still
34263,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As if no life remained in breeze or rill.
34264,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Here paused he while the music now less near
34265,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Breathed with a holier language on his ear,"
34266,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As tho' the distance and that heavenly ray
34267,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Thro' which the sounds came floating took away
34268,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],All that had been too earthly in the lay.
34269,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34270,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Oh! could he listen to such sounds unmoved,"
34271,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And by that light--nor dream of her he loved?
34272,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Dream on, unconscious boy! while yet thou may'st;"
34273,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],'Tis the last bliss thy soul shall ever taste.
34274,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Clasp yet awhile her image to thy heart,"
34275,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Ere all the light that made it dear depart.
34276,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Think of her smiles as when thou saw'st them last,"
34277,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Clear, beautiful, by naught of earth o'ercast;"
34278,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Recall her tears to thee at parting given,"
34279,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Pure as they weep, _if_ angels weep in Heaven."
34280,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Think in her own still bower she waits thee now
34281,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With the same glow of heart and bloom of brow,"
34282,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Yet shrined in solitude--thine all, thine only,"
34283,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Like the one star above thee, bright and lonely."
34284,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Oh! that a dream so sweet, so long enjoyed,"
34285,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Should be so sadly, cruelly destroyed!"
34286,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34287,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The song is husht, the laughing nymphs are flown,"
34288,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And he is left musing of bliss alone;--
34289,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Alone?--no, not alone--that heavy sigh,"
34290,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],That sob of grief which broke from some one nigh--
34291,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Whose could it be?--alas! is misery found
34292,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Here, even here, on this enchanted ground?"
34293,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"He turns and sees a female form close veiled,"
34294,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Leaning, as if both heart and strength had failed,"
34295,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Against a pillar near;--not glittering o'er
34296,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With gems and wreaths such as the others wore,"
34297,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But in that deep-blue, melancholy dress.[85]"
34298,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],BOKHARA'S maidens wear in mindfulness
34299,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of friends or kindred, dead or far away;--"
34300,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And such as ZELICA had on that day
34301,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],He left her--when with heart too full to speak
34302,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],He took away her last warm tears upon his cheek.
34303,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34304,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"A strange emotion stirs within him,--more"
34305,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Than mere compassion ever waked before;
34306,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Unconsciously he opes his arms while she
34307,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Springs forward as with life's last energy,"
34308,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But, swooning in that one convulsive bound,"
34309,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Sinks ere she reach his arms upon the ground;--
34310,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Her veil falls off--her faint hands clasp his knees--
34311,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],'Tis she herself!--it is ZELICA he sees!
34312,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But, ah, so pale, so changed--none but a lover"
34313,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Could in that wreck of beauty's shrine discover
34314,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The once adorned divinity--even he
34315,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Stood for some moments mute, and doubtingly"
34316,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Put back the ringlets from her brow, and gazed"
34317,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Upon those lids where once such lustre blazed,"
34318,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Ere he could think she was _indeed_ his own,"
34319,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Own darling maid whom he so long had known
34320,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In joy and sorrow, beautiful in both;"
34321,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Who, even when grief was heaviest--when loath"
34322,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],He left her for the wars--in that worst hour
34323,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Sat in her sorrow like the sweet night-flower,[86]"
34324,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"When darkness brings its weeping glories out,"
34325,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And spreads its sighs like frankincense about.
34326,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34327,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Look up, my ZELICA--one moment show"
34328,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Those gentle eyes to me that I may know"
34329,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Thy life, thy loveliness is not all gone,"
34330,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""But _there_ at least shines as it ever shone."
34331,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Come, look upon thy AZIM--one dear glance,"
34332,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Like those of old, were heaven! whatever chance"
34333,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Hath brought thee here, oh, 'twas a blessed one!"
34334,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""There--my loved lips--they move--that kiss hath run"
34335,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Like the first shoot of life thro' every vein,"
34336,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""And now I clasp her, mine, all mine again."
34337,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Oh the delight--now, in this very hour,"
34338,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""When had the whole rich world been in my power,"
34339,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""I should have singled out thee only thee,"
34340,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""From the whole world's collected treasury--"
34341,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""To have thee here--to hang thus fondly o'er"
34342,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""My own, best, purest ZELICA once more!"""
34343,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34344,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],It was indeed the touch of those fond lips
34345,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Upon her eyes that chased their short eclipse.
34346,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And gradual as the snow at Heaven's breath
34347,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Melts off and shows the azure flowers beneath,"
34348,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Her lids unclosed and the bright eyes were seen
34349,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Gazing on his--not, as they late had been,"
34350,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Quick, restless, wild, but mournfully serene;"
34351,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As if to lie even for that tranced minute
34352,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],So near his heart had consolation in it;
34353,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And thus to wake in his beloved caress
34354,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Took from her soul one half its wretchedness.
34355,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But, when she heard him call her good and pure,"
34356,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Oh! 'twas too much--too dreadful to endure!
34357,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Shuddering she broke away from his embrace.
34358,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And hiding with both hands her guilty face
34359,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Said in a tone whose anguish would have riven
34360,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"A heart of very marble, ""Pure!--oh Heaven!""--"
34361,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34362,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That tone--those looks so changed--the withering blight,"
34363,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],That sin and sorrow leave where'er they light:
34364,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The dead despondency of those sunk eyes,"
34365,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Where once, had he thus met her by surprise,"
34366,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"He would have seen himself, too happy boy,"
34367,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Reflected in a thousand lights of joy:
34368,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And then the place,--that bright, unholy place,"
34369,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Where vice lay hid beneath each winning grace
34370,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And charm of luxury as the viper weaves
34371,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Its wily covering of sweet balsam leaves,[87]--"
34372,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"All struck upon his heart, sudden and cold"
34373,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As death itself;--it needs not to be told--
34374,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"No, no--he sees it all plain as the brand"
34375,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of burning shame can mark--whate'er the hand,"
34376,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That could from Heaven and him such brightness sever,"
34377,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],'Tis done--to Heaven and him she's lost for ever!
34378,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"It was a dreadful moment; not the tears,"
34379,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The lingering, lasting misery of years"
34380,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Could match that minute's anguish--all the worst
34381,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of sorrow's elements in that dark burst
34382,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Broke o'er his soul and with one crash of fate
34383,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Laid the whole hopes of his life desolate.
34384,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34385,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Oh! curse me not,"" she cried, as wild he tost"
34386,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"His desperate hand towards Heav'n--""tho' I am lost,"
34387,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Think not that guilt, that falsehood made me fall,"
34388,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""No, no--'twas grief, 'twas madness did it all!"
34389,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Nay, doubt me not--tho' all thy love hath ceased--"
34390,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""I know it hath--yet, yet believe, at least,"
34391,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""That every spark of reason's light must be"
34392,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Quenched in this brain ere I could stray from thee."
34393,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""They told me thou wert dead--why, AZIM, why"
34394,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Did we not, both of us, that instant die"
34395,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""When we were parted? oh! couldst thou but know"
34396,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""With what a deep devotedness of woe"
34397,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""I wept thy absence--o'er and o'er again"
34398,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Thinking of thee, still thee, till thought grew pain,"
34399,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""And memory like a drop that night and day"
34400,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Falls cold and ceaseless wore my heart away."
34401,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Didst thou but know how pale I sat at home,"
34402,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""My eyes still turned the way thou wert to come,"
34403,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""And, all the long, long night of hope and fear,"
34404,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Thy voice and step still sounding in my ear--"
34405,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Oh God! thou wouldst not wonder that at last,"
34406,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""When every hope was all at once o'ercast,"
34407,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""When I heard frightful voices round me say"
34408,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""_Azim is dead_!--this wretched brain gave way,"
34409,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""And I became a wreck, at random driven,"
34410,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Without one glimpse of reason or of Heaven--"
34411,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""All wild--and even this quenchless love within"

34413,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Thou pitiest me--I knew thou wouldst--that sky"

34516,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Fleetly as some dark, ominous bird of night,"
34517,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Across the sun; and soon was out of sight!
34518,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34519,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34520,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],LALLA ROOKH could think of nothing all day but the misery of those two
34521,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"young lovers. Her gayety was gone, and she looked pensively even upon"
34522,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"FADLAPEEN. She felt, too, without knowing why, a sort of uneasy pleasure"
34523,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],in imagining that AZIM must have been just such a youth as FERAMORZ; just
34524,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"as worthy to enjoy all the blessings, without any of the pangs, of that"
34525,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"illusive passion, which too often like the sunny apples of Istkahar[88]"
34526,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],is all sweetness on one side and all bitterness on the other.
34527,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34528,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As they passed along a sequestered river after sunset they saw a young
34529,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Hindoo girl upon the bank, whose employment seemed to them so strange that"
34530,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],they stopped their palankeens to observe her. She had lighted a small lamp
34531,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"filled with oil of cocoa, and placing it in an earthen dish adorned with a"
34532,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"wreath of flowers, had committed it with a trembling hand to the stream;"
34533,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"and was now anxiously watching its progress down the current, heedless of"
34534,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],the gay cavalcade which had drawn up beside her. LALLA ROOKH was all
34535,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"curiosity;--when one of her attendants, who had lived upon the banks of"
34536,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"the Ganges, (where this ceremony is so frequent that often in the dusk of"
34537,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"the evening the river is seen glittering all over with lights, like the"
34538,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Oton-tala or Sea of Stars,)[89] informed the princess that it was the"
34539,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],usual way in which the friends of those who had gone on dangerous voyages
34540,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],offered up vows for their safe return. If the lamp sunk immediately the
34541,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],omen was disastrous; but if it went shining down the stream and continued
34542,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"to burn till entirely out of sight, the return of the beloved object was"
34543,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],considered as certain.
34544,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34545,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],LALLA ROOKH as they moved on more than once looked back to observe how the
34546,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],young Hindoo's lamp proceeded; and while she saw with pleasure that it was
34547,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],still unextinguished she could not help fearing that all the hopes of this
34548,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],life were no better than that feeble light upon the river. The remainder
34549,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],of the journey was passed in silence. She now for the first time felt that
34550,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],shade of melancholy which comes over the youthful maiden's heart as sweet
34551,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],and transient as her own breath upon a mirror; nor was it till she heard
34552,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"the lute of FERAMOKZ, touched lightly at the door of her pavilion that she"
34553,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],waked from the revery in which she had been wandering. Instantly her eyes
34554,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],were lighted up with pleasure; and after a few unheard remarks from
34555,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],FADLADEEN upon the indecorum of a poet seating himself in presence of a
34556,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Princess everything was arranged as on the preceding evening and all
34557,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],listened with eagerness while the story was thus continued:--
34558,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34559,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34560,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Whose are the gilded tents that crowd the way,"
34561,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Where all was waste and silent yesterday?
34562,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"This City of War which, in a few short hours,"
34563,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Hath sprung up here, as if the magic powers[90]"
34564,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of Him who, in the twinkling of a star,"
34565,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Built the high pillared halls of CHILMINAR,[91]"
34566,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Had conjur'd up, far as the eye can see,"
34567,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],This world of tents and domes and sunbright armory:--
34568,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Princely pavilions screened by many a fold
34569,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of crimson cloth and topt with balls of gold:--
34570,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Steeds with their housings of rich silver spun,"
34571,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Their chains and poitrels glittering in the sun;
34572,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And camels tufted o'er with Yemen's shells[92]
34573,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Shaking in every breeze their light-toned bells!
34574,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34575,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But yester-eve, so motionless around,"
34576,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],So mute was this wide plain that not a sound
34577,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But the far torrent or the locust bird[93]
34578,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Hunting among thickets could be heard;--
34579,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Yet hark! what discords now of every kind,"
34580,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Shouts, laughs, and screams are revelling in the wind;"
34581,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The neigh of cavalry;--the tinkling throngs
34582,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of laden camels and their drivers' songs;--
34583,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Ringing of arms, and flapping in the breeze"
34584,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of streamers from ten thousand canopies;--[94]
34585,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],War-music bursting out from time to time
34586,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],With gong and tymbalon's tremendous chime;--
34587,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Or in the pause when harsher sounds are mute,"
34588,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The mellow breathings of some horn or flute,"
34589,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That far off, broken by the eagle note"
34590,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of the Abyssinian trumpet, swell and float.[95]"
34591,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34592,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Who leads this mighty army?--ask ye ""who?"""
34593,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And mark ye not those banners of dark hue,"
34594,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The Night and Shadow, over yonder tent?--[96]"
34595,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],It is the CALIPH'S glorious armament.
34596,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Roused in his Palace by the dread alarms,"
34597,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That hourly came, of the false Prophet's arms,"
34598,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And of his host of infidels who hurled
34599,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Defiance fierce at Islam and the world,[97]"
34600,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Tho' worn with Grecian warfare, and behind"
34601,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The veils of his bright Palace calm reclined,"
34602,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Yet brooked he not such blasphemy should stain,"
34603,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Thus unrevenged, the evening of his reign;"
34604,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But having sworn upon the Holy Grave[98]
34605,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To conquer or to perish, once more gave"
34606,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"His shadowy banners proudly to the breeze,"
34607,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And with an army nurst in victories,"
34608,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Here stands to crush the rebels that o'errun
34609,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],His blest and beauteous Province of the Sun.
34610,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34611,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Ne'er did the march of MAHADI display
34612,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Such pomp before;--not even when on his way
34613,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To MECCA'S Temple, when both land and sea"
34614,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Were spoiled to feed the Pilgrim's luxury;[99]
34615,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],When round him mid the burning sands he saw
34616,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Fruits of the North in icy freshness thaw,"
34617,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And cooled his thirsty lip beneath the glow
34618,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of MECCA'S sun with urns of Persian snow:--
34619,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Nor e'er did armament more grand than that
34620,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Pour from the kingdoms of the Caliphat.
34621,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"First, in the van, the People of the Rock[100]"
34622,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],On their light mountain steeds of royal stock:[101]
34623,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Then chieftains of DAMASCUS proud to see
34624,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The flashing of their swords' rich marquetry;--[102]
34625,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Men from the regions near the VOLGA'S mouth
34626,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Mixt with the rude, black archers of the South;"
34627,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And Indian lancers in white-turbaned ranks
34628,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"From the far SINDE or ATTOCK'S sacred banks,"
34629,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With dusky legions from the Land of Myrrh,[103]"
34630,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And many a mace-armed Moor and Midsea islander.
34631,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34632,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Nor less in number tho' more new and rude
34633,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],In warfare's school was the vast multitude
34634,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That, fired by zeal or by oppression wronged,"
34635,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Round the white standard of the impostor thronged.
34636,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Beside his thousands of Believers--blind,"
34637,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Burning and headlong as the Samiel wind--
34638,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Many who felt and more who feared to feel
34639,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The bloody Islamite's converting steel,"
34640,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Flockt to his banner;--Chiefs of the UZBEK race,"
34641,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Waving their heron crests with martial grace;[104]
34642,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"TURKOMANS, countless as their flocks, led forth"
34643,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],From the aromatic pastures of the North;
34644,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Wild warriors of the turquoise hills,--and those[105]"
34645,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Who dwell beyond the everlasting snows
34646,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of HINDOO KOSH, in stormy freedom bred,"
34647,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Their fort the rock, their camp the torrent's bed."
34648,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But none of all who owned the Chief's command
34649,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Rushed to that battle-field with bolder hand
34650,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Or sterner hate than IRAN'S outlawed men,"
34651,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Her Worshippers of Fire--all panting then[106]
34652,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],For vengeance on the accursed Saracen;
34653,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Vengeance at last for their dear country spurned,"
34654,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Her throne usurpt, and her bright shrines o'erturned."
34655,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34656,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],From YEZD'S eternal Mansion of the Fire[107]
34657,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Where aged saints in dreams of Heaven expire:
34658,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],From BADKU and those fountains of blue flame
34659,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That burn into the CASPIAN, fierce they came,[108]"
34660,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Careless for what or whom the blow was sped,"
34661,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],So vengeance triumpht and their tyrants bled.
34662,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34663,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Such was the wild and miscellaneous host
34664,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],That high in air their motley banners tost
34665,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Around the Prophet-Chief--all eyes still bent
34666,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Upon that glittering Veil, where'er it went,"
34667,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That beacon thro' the battle's stormy flood,"
34668,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],That rainbow of the field whose showers were blood!
34669,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34670,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Twice hath the sun upon their conflict set
34671,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And risen again and found them grappling yet;
34672,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"While streams of carnage in his noontide blaze,"
34673,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Smoke up to Heaven--hot as that crimson haze
34674,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],By which the prostrate Caravan is awed[109]
34675,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],In the red Desert when the wind's abroad.
34676,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Oh, Swords of God!"" the panting CALIPH calls,--"
34677,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Thrones for the living--Heaven for him who falls!""--"
34678,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""On, brave avengers, on,"" MOKANNA cries,"
34679,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""And EBLIS blast the recreant slave that flies!"""
34680,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Now comes the brunt, the crisis of the day--"
34681,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],They clash--they strive--the CALIPH'S troops give way!
34682,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"MOKANNA'S self plucks the black Banner down,"
34683,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And now the Orient World's Imperial crown
34684,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Is just within his grasp--when, hark, that shout!"
34685,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Some hand hath checkt the flying Moslem's rout;
34686,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And now they turn, they rally--at their head"
34687,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"A warrior, (like those angel youths who led,"
34688,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In glorious panoply of Heaven's own mail,"
34689,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The Champions of the Faith thro BEDER'S vale,)[110]"
34690,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Bold as if gifted with ten thousand lives,"
34691,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Turns on the fierce pursuers' blades, and drives"
34692,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],At once the multitudinous torrent back--
34693,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],While hope and courage kindle in his track;
34694,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And at each step his bloody falchion makes
34695,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Terrible vistas thro' which victory breaks!
34696,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In vain MOKANNA, midst the general flight,"
34697,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Stands like the red moon on some stormy night
34698,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Among the fugitive clouds that hurrying by
34699,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Leave only her unshaken in the sky--
34700,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In vain he yells his desperate curses out,"
34701,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Deals death promiscuously to all about,"
34702,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To foes that charge and coward friends that fly,"
34703,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And seems of _all_ the Great Archenemy.
34704,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The panic spreads--""A miracle!"" throughout"
34705,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The Moslem ranks, ""a miracle!"" they shout,"
34706,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],All gazing on that youth whose coming seems
34707,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"A light, a glory, such as breaks in dreams;"
34708,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And every sword, true as o'er billows dim"
34709,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The needle tracks the lode-star, following him!"
34710,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34711,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Right towards MOKANNA now he cleaves his path,"
34712,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Impatient cleaves as tho' the bolt of wrath
34713,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],He bears from Heaven withheld its awful burst
34714,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"From weaker heads and souls but half way curst,"
34715,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To break o'er Him, the mightiest and the worst!"
34716,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But vain his speed--tho', in that hour of blood,"
34717,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Had all God's seraphs round MOKANNA stood
34718,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With swords o'fire ready like fate to fall,"
34719,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],MOKANNA'S soul would have defied them all;
34720,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Yet now, the rush of fugitives, too strong"
34721,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"For human force, hurries even _him_ along;"
34722,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],In vain he struggles mid the wedged array
34723,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of flying thousands--he is borne away;
34724,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And the sole joy his baffled spirit knows,"
34725,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In this forced flight, is--murdering as he goes!"
34726,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As a grim tiger whom the torrent's might
34727,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Surprises in some parched ravine at night,"
34728,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Turns even in drowning on the wretched flocks
34729,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Swept with him in that snow-flood from the rocks,"
34730,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And, to the last, devouring on his way,"
34731,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Bloodies the stream lie hath not power to stay.
34732,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34733,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Alla illa Alla!""--the glad shout renew--"

34736,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And light your shrines and chant your ziraleets.[112]
34737,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The swords of God have triumpht--on his throne
34738,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Your Caliph sits and the veiled Chief hath flown.
34739,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Who does not envy that young warrior now
34740,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To whom the Lord of Islam bends his brow,"
34741,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In all the graceful gratitude of power,"
34742,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],For his throne's safety in that perilous hour?
34743,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Who doth not wonder, when, amidst the acclaim"
34744,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of thousands heralding to heaven his name--

34746,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Which sound along the path of virtuous souls,"
34747,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Like music round a planet as it rolls,--"
34748,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"He turns away--coldly, as if some gloom"
34749,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Hung o'er his heart no triumphs can illume;--
34750,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Some sightless grief upon whose blasted gaze
34751,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Tho' glory's light may play, in vain it plays."
34752,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Yes, wretched AZIM! thine is such a grief,"
34753,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Beyond all hope, all terror, all relief!"
34754,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"A dark, cold calm, which nothing now can break."
34755,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Or warm or brighten,--Like that Syrian Lake[113]"
34756,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Upon whose surface morn and summer shed
34757,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Their smiles in vain, for all beneath is dead!--"
34758,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Hearts there have been o'er which this weight of woe
34759,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Came by long use of suffering, tame and slow;"
34760,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But thine, lost youth! was sudden--over thee"
34761,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"It broke at once, when all seemed ecstasy;"
34762,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],When Hope lookt up and saw the gloomy Past
34763,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Melt into splendor and Bliss dawn at last--
34764,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"'Twas then, even then, o'er joys so freshly blown"
34765,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],This mortal blight of misery came down;
34766,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Even then, the full, warm gushings of thy heart"
34767,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Were checkt--like fount-drops, frozen as they start--"
34768,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And there like them cold, sunless relics hang,"
34769,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Each fixt and chilled into a lasting pang.
34770,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34771,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"One sole desire, one passion now remains"
34772,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To keep life's fever still within his veins,"
34773,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Vengeance!--dire vengeance on the wretch who cast
34774,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],O'er him and all he loved that ruinous blast.
34775,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"For this, when rumors reached him in his flight"

34780,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And when all hope seemed desperate, wildly hurled"
34781,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Himself into the scale and saved a world.
34782,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"For this he still lives on, careless of all"
34783,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The wreaths that Glory on his path lets fall;
34784,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"For this alone exists--like lightning-fire,"
34785,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],To speed one bolt of vengeance and expire!
34786,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34787,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But safe as yet that Spirit of Evil lives;

34789,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The last sole stubborn fragment left unriven
34790,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of the proud host that late stood fronting Heaven,"
34791,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],He gained MEROU--breathed a short curse of blood
34792,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"O'er his lost throne--then past the JIHON'S flood,[114]"
34793,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And gathering all whose madness of belief
34794,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Still saw a Saviour in their down-fallen Chief,"
34795,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Raised the white banner within NEKSHEB'S gates,[115]"
34796,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And there, untamed, the approaching conqueror waits."
34797,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34798,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of all his Haram, all that busy hive,"
34799,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With music and with sweets sparkling alive,"
34800,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"He took but one, the partner of his flight,"
34801,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],One--not for love--not for her beauty's light--
34802,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"No, ZELICA stood withering midst the gay."
34803,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Wan as the blossom that fell yesterday
34804,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"From the Alma tree and dies, while overhead"
34805,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],To-day's young flower is springing in its stead.[116]
34806,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Oh, not for love--the deepest Damned must be"
34807,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Touched with Heaven's glory ere such fiends as he
34808,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Can feel one glimpse of Love's divinity.
34809,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But no, she is his victim; _there_ lie all"
34810,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Her charms for him-charms that can never pall,"
34811,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"As long as hell within his heart can stir,"
34812,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Or one faint trace of Heaven is left in her.
34813,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To work an angel's ruin,--to behold"
34814,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As white a page as Virtue e'er unrolled
34815,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Blacken beneath his touch into a scroll
34816,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of damning sins, sealed with a burning soul--"
34817,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"This is his triumph; this the joy accurst,"
34818,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],That ranks him among demons all but first:
34819,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],This gives the victim that before him lies
34820,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Blighted and lost, a glory in his eyes,"
34821,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],A light like that with which hellfire illumes
34822,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The ghastly, writhing wretch whom it consumes!"
34823,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34824,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But other tasks now wait him--tasks that need
34825,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],All the deep daringness of thought and deed
34826,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With which the Divs have gifted him--for mark,[117]"
34827,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Over yon plains which night had else made dark,"
34828,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Those lanterns countless as the winged lights
34829,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That spangle INDIA'S field on showery nights,--[118]"
34830,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Far as their formidable gleams they shed,"
34831,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The mighty tents of the beleaguerer spread,"
34832,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Glimmering along the horizon's dusky line
34833,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And thence in nearer circles till they shine
34834,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Among the founts and groves o'er which the town
34835,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],In all its armed magnificence looks down.
34836,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Yet, fearless, from his lofty battlements"
34837,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],MOKANNA views that multitude of tents;
34838,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Nay, smiles to think that, tho' entoiled, beset,"
34839,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Not less than myriads dare to front him yet;--
34840,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That friendless, throneless, he thus stands at bay,"
34841,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Even thus a match for myriads such as they.
34842,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Oh, for a sweep of that dark Angel's wing,"
34843,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Who brushed the thousands of the Assyrian King[119]"
34844,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""To darkness in a moment that I might"

34874,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Round the rich city and the plain for miles,--"
34875,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Flinging such radiance o'er the gilded tiles
34876,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of many a dome and fair-roofed imaret
34877,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As autumn suns shed round them when they set.
34878,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Instant from all who saw the illusive sign
34879,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"A murmur broke--""Miraculous! divine!"""

34891,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And forth like a diminutive mountain-tide
34892,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Into the boundless sea they speed their course
34893,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Right on into the MOSLEM'S mighty force.
34894,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The watchmen of the camp,--who in their rounds"

34912,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And back to NEKSHEB'S gates covering the plain
34913,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],With random slaughter drives the adventurous train;
34914,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Among the last of whom the Silver Veil
34915,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Is seen glittering at times, like the white sail"
34916,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of some tost vessel on a stormy night

34918,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34919,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And hath not this brought the proud spirit low!
34920,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Nor dashed his brow nor checkt his daring? No.
34921,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Tho' half the wretches whom at night he led
34922,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To thrones and victory lie disgraced and dead,"
34923,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Yet morning hears him with unshrinking crest.
34924,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Still vaunt of thrones and victory to the rest;--
34925,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And they believe him!--oh, the lover may"

34928,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],With Heaven's rainbow;--alchymists may doubt

34931,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],To some dear falsehood hugs it to the last.
34932,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34933,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And well the Impostor knew all lures and arts,"
34934,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],That LUCIFER e'er taught to tangle hearts;
34935,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Nor, mid these last bold workings of his plot"
34936,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Against men's souls, is ZELICA forgot."
34937,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Ill-fated ZELICA! had reason been
34938,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Awake, thro' half the horrors thou hast seen,"
34939,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Thou never couldst have borne it--Death had come
34940,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],At once and taken thy wrung spirit home.
34941,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But 'twas not so--a torpor, a suspense"
34942,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of thought, almost of life, came o'er the intense"
34943,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And passionate struggles of that fearful night,"
34944,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],When her last hope of peace and heaven took flight:
34945,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And tho' at times a gleam of frenzy broke,--"
34946,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As thro' some dull volcano's veil of smoke
34947,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Ominous flashings now and then will start,"
34948,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Which show the fire's still busy at its heart;
34949,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Yet was she mostly wrapt in solemn gloom,--"
34950,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Not such as AZIM'S, brooding o'er its doom"
34951,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And calm without as is the brow of death
34952,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],While busy worms are gnawing underneath--
34953,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But in a blank and pulseless torpor free
34954,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"From thought or pain, a sealed-up apathy"
34955,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Which left her oft with scarce one living thrill
34956,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The cold, pale victim of her torturer's will."
34957,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34958,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Again, as in MEROU, he had her deckt"
34959,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Gorgeously out, the Priestess of the sect;"
34960,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And led her glittering forth before the eyes
34961,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of his rude train as to a sacrifice,--"
34962,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Pallid as she, the young, devoted Bride"
34963,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of the fierce NILE, when, deckt in all the pride"
34964,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of nuptial pomp, she sinks into his tide.[128]"
34965,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And while the wretched maid hung down her head,"
34966,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And stood as one just risen from the dead
34967,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Amid that gazing crowd, the fiend would tell"
34968,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],His credulous slaves it was some charm or spell
34969,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Possest her now,--and from that darkened trance"
34970,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Should dawn ere long their Faith's deliverance.
34971,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Or if at times goaded by guilty shame,"
34972,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Her soul was roused and words of wildness came,"
34973,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Instant the bold blasphemer would translate
34974,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Her ravings into oracles of fate,"
34975,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Would hail Heaven's signals in her flashing eyes
34976,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And call her shrieks the language of the skies!
34977,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
34978,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But vain at length his arts--despair is seen
34979,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Gathering around; and famine comes to glean
34980,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],All that the sword had left unreaped;--in vain
34981,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],At morn and eve across the northern plain
34982,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],He looks impatient for the promised spears
34983,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of the wild Hordes and TARTAR mountaineers;
34984,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],They come not--while his fierce beleaguerers pour
34985,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Engines of havoc in, unknown before,[129]"
34986,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And horrible as new;--javelins, that fly[130]"
34987,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Enwreathed with smoky flames thro' the dark sky,"

34989,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Discharge as from a kindled Naphtha fount[131]
34990,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Showers of consuming fire o'er all below;
34991,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Looking as thro' the illumined night they go
34992,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Like those wild birds that by the Magians oft[132]
34993,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],At festivals of fire were sent aloft
34994,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Into the air with blazing fagots tied
34995,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To their huge wings, scattering combustion wide."
34996,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],All night the groans of wretches who expire
34997,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],In agony beneath these darts of fire
34998,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Ring thro' the city--while descending o'er
34999,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Its shrines and domes and streets of sycamore,--"
35000,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Its lone bazars, with their bright cloths of gold,"
35001,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Since the last peaceful pageant left unrolled,--"
35002,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Its beauteous marble baths whose idle jets.
35003,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Now gush with blood,--and its tall minarets"
35004,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],That late have stood up in the evening glare
35005,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of the red sun, unhallowed by a prayer;--"
35006,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"O'er each in turn the dreadful flame-bolts fall,"
35007,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And death and conflagration throughout all

35009,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
35010,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],MOKANNA sees the world is his no more;--

35031,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""All earth shall feel the unveiling of this brow!"
35032,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""To-night--yes, sainted men! this very night,"
35033,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""I bid you all to a fair festal rite,"
35034,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Where--having deep refreshed each weary limb"
35035,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""With viands such as feast Heaven's cherubim"
35036,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""And kindled up your souls now sunk and dim"
35037,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""With that pure wine the Dark-eyed Maids above"
35038,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Keep, sealed with precious musk, for those they love,--[133]"
35039,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""I will myself uncurtain in your sight"
35040,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""The wonders of this brow's ineffable light;"
35041,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Then lead you forth and with a wink disperse"
35042,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Yon myriads howling thro' the universe!"""
35043,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
35044,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Eager they listen--while each accent darts
35045,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],New life into their chilled and hope-sick hearts;
35046,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Such treacherous life as the cool draught supplies
35047,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],To him upon the stake who drinks and dies!
35048,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Wildly they point their lances to the light
35049,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of the fast sinking sun, and shout ""To-night!""--"
35050,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""To-night,"" their Chief re-echoes in a voice"
35051,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of fiend-like mockery that bids hell rejoice.
35052,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Deluded victims!--never hath this earth
35053,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Seen mourning half so mournful as their mirth.
35054,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"_Here_, to the few whose iron frames had stood"
35055,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"This racking waste of famine and of blood,"
35056,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Faint, dying wretches clung, from whom the shout"
35057,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of triumph like a maniac's laugh broke out:--
35058,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"_There_, others, lighted by the smouldering fire,"
35059,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Danced like wan ghosts about a funeral pyre
35060,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Among the dead and dying strewed around;--
35061,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],While some pale wretch lookt on and from his wound
35062,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Plucking the fiery dart by which he bled,"
35063,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],In ghastly transport waved it o'er his head!
35064,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
35065,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],'Twas more than midnight now--a fearful pause
35066,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Had followed the long shouts, the wild applause,"
35067,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That lately from those Royal Gardens burst,"
35068,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Where the veiled demon held his feast accurst,"
35069,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"When ZELICA, alas, poor ruined heart,"
35070,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],In every horror doomed to bear its part!--
35071,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Was bidden to the banquet by a slave,"
35072,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Who, while his quivering lip the summons gave,"
35073,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Grew black, as tho' the shadows of the grave"
35074,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Compast him round and ere he could repeat
35075,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"His message thro', fell lifeless at her feet!"
35076,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Shuddering she went--a soul-felt pang of fear
35077,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"A presage that her own dark doom was near,"
35078,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Roused every feeling and brought Reason back
35079,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Once more to writhe her last upon the rack.
35080,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],All round seemed tranquil even the foe had ceased
35081,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As if aware of that demoniac feast
35082,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"His fiery bolts; and tho' the heavens looked red,"
35083,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],'Twas but some distant conflagration's spread.
35084,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But hark--she stops--she listens--dreadful tone!
35085,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"'Tis her Tormentor's laugh--and now, a groan,"
35086,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],A long death-groan comes with it--can this be
35087,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The place of mirth, the bower of revelry?"
35088,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
35089,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"She enters--Holy ALLA, what a sight"
35090,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Was there before her! By the glimmering light
35091,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of the pale dawn, mixt with the flare of brands"
35092,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"That round lay burning dropt from lifeless hands,"
35093,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"She saw the board in splendid mockery spread,"
35094,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Rich censers breathing--garlands overhead--
35095,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The urns, the cups, from which they late had quaft"
35096,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"All gold and gems, but--what had been the draught?"
35097,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Oh! who need ask that saw those livid guests,"
35098,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With their swollen heads sunk blackening on their breasts,"
35099,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Or looking pale to Heaven with glassy glare,"
35100,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],As if they sought but saw no mercy there;
35101,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"As if they felt, tho' poison racked them thro',"
35102,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Remorse the deadlier torment of the two!
35103,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"While some, the bravest, hardiest in the train"
35104,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of their false Chief, who on the battle-plain"
35105,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Would have met death with transport by his side,"
35106,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Here mute and helpless gasped;--but as they died
35107,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Lookt horrible vengeance with their eyes' last strain,"
35108,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And clenched the slackening hand at him in vain.
35109,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
35110,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Dreadful it was to see the ghastly stare,"
35111,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The stony look of horror and despair,"
35112,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Which some of these expiring victims cast
35113,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Upon their souls' tormentor to the last;
35114,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Upon that mocking Fiend whose Veil now raised,"
35115,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Showed them as in death's agony they gazed,"
35116,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Not the long promised light, the brow whose beaming"
35117,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Was to come forth, all conquering, all redeeming,"
35118,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But features horribler than Hell e'er traced
35119,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"On its own brood;--no Demon of the Waste,[134]"
35120,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],No church-yard Ghoul caught lingering in the light
35121,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of the blest sun, e'er blasted human sight"
35122,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With lineaments so foul, so fierce as those"
35123,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The Impostor now in grinning mockery shows:--
35124,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""There, ye wise Saints, behold your Light, your Star--"
35125,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Ye _would_ be dupes and victims and ye _are_."
35126,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Is it enough? or must I, while a thrill"
35127,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Lives in your sapient bosoms, cheat you still?"
35128,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Swear that the burning death ye feel within"
35129,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Is but the trance with which Heaven's joys begin:"
35130,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""That this foul visage, foul as e'er disgraced"
35131,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Even monstrous men, is--after God's own taste;"
35132,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""And that--but see!--ere I have half-way said"
35133,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""My greetings thro', the uncourteous souls are fled."
35134,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Farewell, sweet spirits! not in vain ye die,"
35135,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""If EBLIS loves you half so well as I.--"
35136,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Ha, my young bride!--'tis well--take thou thy seat;"
35137,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Nay come--no shuddering--didst thou never meet"
35138,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""The Dead before?--they graced our wedding, sweet;"
35139,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""And these, my guests to-night, have brimmed so true"
35140,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Their parting cups, that _thou_ shalt pledge one too."
35141,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""But--how is this?--all empty? all drunk up?"
35142,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Hot lips have been before thee in the cup,"
35143,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Young bride,--yet stay--one precious drop remains,"
35144,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Enough to warm a gentle Priestess' veins;--"
35145,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Here, drink--and should thy lover's conquering arms"

35149,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
35150,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""For, _me_--I too must die--but not like these"
35151,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Vile rankling things to fester in the breeze;"
35152,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""To have this brow in ruffian triumph shown,"

35185,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
35186,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],He sprung and sunk as the last words were said--
35187,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Quick closed the burning waters o'er his head,"
35188,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And ZELICA was left--within the ring
35189,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Of those wide walls the only living thing;
35190,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The only wretched one still curst with breath
35191,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],In all that frightful wilderness of death!
35192,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"More like some bloodless ghost--such as they tell,"
35193,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In the Lone Cities of the Silent dwell,[135]"
35194,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And there unseen of all but ALLA sit
35195,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Each by its own pale carcass watching it.
35196,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But morn is up and a fresh warfare stirs
35197,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Throughout the camp of the beleaguerers.
35198,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Their globes of fire (the dread artillery lent
35199,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],By GREECE to conquering MAHADI) are spent;
35200,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And now the scorpion's shaft, the quarry sent"
35201,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],From high balistas and the shielded throng
35202,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Of soldiers swinging the huge ram along,"
35203,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],All speak the impatient Islamite's intent
35204,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"To try, at length, if tower and battlement"
35205,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And bastioned wall be not less hard to win,"
35206,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Less tough to break down than the hearts within.
35207,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"First he, in impatience and in toil is"
35208,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],The burning AZIM--oh! could he but see
35209,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The impostor once alive within his grasp,"
35210,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Not the gaunt lion's hug nor boa's clasp
35211,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Could match thy gripe of vengeance or keep pace
35212,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],With the fell heartiness of Hate's embrace!
35213,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
35214,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Loud rings the ponderous ram against the walls;
35215,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Now shake the ramparts, now a buttress falls,"
35216,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But, still no breach--""Once more one mighty swing"
35217,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Of all your beams, together thundering!"""
35218,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"There--the wall shakes--the shouting troops exult,"
35219,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Quick, quick discharge your weightiest catapult"
35220,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Right on that spot and NEKSHEB is our own!"""
35221,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"'Tis done--the battlements come crashing down,"
35222,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And the huge wall by that stroke riven in two
35223,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Yawning like some old crater rent anew,"
35224,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Shows the dim, desolate city smoking thro'."
35225,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But strange! no sign of life--naught living seen
35226,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Above, below--what can this stillness mean?"
35227,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],A minute's pause suspends all hearts and eyes--
35228,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""In thro' the breach,"" impetuous AZIM cries;"
35229,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],But the cool CALIPH fearful of some wile
35230,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],In this blank stillness checks the troops awhile.--
35231,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Just then a figure with slow step advanced
35232,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Forth from the ruined walls and as there glanced
35233,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],A sunbeam over it all eyes could see
35234,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The well-known Silver Veil!--""'Tis He, 'tis He,"
35235,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""MOKANNA and alone!"" they shout around;"
35236,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Young AZIM from his steed springs to the ground--
35237,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Mine, Holy Caliph! mine,"" he cries, ""the task"
35238,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""To crush yon daring wretch--'tis all I ask."""
35239,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Eager he darts to meet the demon foe
35240,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Who still across wide heaps of ruin slow
35241,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"And falteringly comes, till they are near;"
35242,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Then with a bound rushes on AZIM'S spear,"
35243,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And casting off the Veil in falling shows--
35244,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Oh!--'tis his ZELICA'S life-blood that flows!
35245,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
35246,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""I meant not, AZIM,"" soothingly she said,"
35247,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"As on his trembling arm she leaned her head,"
35248,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],And looking in his face saw anguish there
35249,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Beyond all wounds the quivering flesh can bear--
35250,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""I meant not _thou_ shouldst have the pain of this:--"
35251,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Tho' death with thee thus tasted is a bliss"
35252,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Thou wouldst not rob me of, didst thou but know"
35253,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""How oft I've prayed to God I might die so!"
35254,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""But the Fiend's venom was too scant and slow;--"
35255,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""To linger on were maddening--and I thought"
35256,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""If once that Veil--nay, look not on it--caught"
35257,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""The eyes of your fierce soldiery, I should be"
35258,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Struck by a thousand death-darts instantly."
35259,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""But this is sweeter--oh! believe me, yes--"
35260,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""I would not change this sad, but dear caress."

35300,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The maiden's death and the youth's agony,"
35301,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Were living still--when, by a rustic grave,"
35302,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Beside the swift Amoo's transparent wave,"
35303,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],An aged man who had grown aged there
35304,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"By that lone grave, morning and night in prayer,"
35305,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],For the last time knelt down--and tho' the shade

35307,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"A gleam of rapture on his eye and cheek,"
35308,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],That brightened even Death--like the last streak

35319,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
35320,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"The story of the Veiled Prophet of Khorassan being ended, they were now"
35321,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],doomed to hear FADLADEEN'S criticisms upon it. A series of disappointments
35322,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],and accidents had occurred to this learned Chamberlain during the journey.
35323,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"In the first place, those couriers stationed, as in the reign of Shah"

35325,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"supply of mangoes for the Royal Table, had by some cruel irregularity"
35326,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],failed in their duty; and to eat any mangoes but those of Mazagong was of

35334,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Koran-bearer three whole days; not without much spiritual alarm to
35335,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],FADLADEEN who though professing to hold with other loyal and orthodox
35336,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Mussulmans that salvation could only be found in the Koran was strongly
35337,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],suspected of believing in his heart that it could only be found in his own
35338,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],particular copy of it. When to all these grievances is added the obstinacy
35339,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],of the cooks in putting the pepper of Canara into his dishes instead of
35340,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"the cinnamon of Serendib, we may easily suppose that he came to the task"
35341,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],of criticism with at least a sufficient degree of irritability for the
35342,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],purpose.

35353,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"that be all that is required the matter is easily despatched."" He then"
35354,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"proceeded to analyze the poem, in that strain (so well known to the"
35355,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"unfortunate bards of Delhi), whose censures were an infliction from which"
35356,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],few recovered and whose very praises were like the honey extracted from
35357,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"the bitter flowers of the aloe. The chief personages of the story were, if"
35358,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"he rightly understood them, an ill-favored gentleman with a veil over his"
35359,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],face;--a young lady whose reason went and came according as it suited the
35360,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],poet's convenience to be sensible or otherwise;--and a youth in one of
35361,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"those hideous Bokharian bonnets, who took the aforesaid gentleman in a"
35362,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"veil for a Divinity. ""From such materials,"" said he, ""what can be"
35363,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],expected?--after rivalling each other in long speeches and absurdities
35364,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"through some thousands of lines as indigestible as the filberts of Berdaa,"
35365,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],our friend in the veil jumps into a tub of aquafortis; the young lady dies
35366,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],in a set speech whose only recommendation is that it is her last; and the
35367,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],lover lives on to a good old age for the laudable purpose of seeing her

35371,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"need to be jealous of his abilities for story-telling."""
35372,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
35373,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"With respect to the style, it was worthy of the matter;--it had not even"
35374,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],those politic contrivances of structure which make up for the commonness
35375,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],of the thoughts by the peculiarity of the manner nor that stately poetical
35376,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"phraseology by which sentiments mean in themselves, like the blacksmith's"
35377,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"[138] apron converted into a banner, are so easily gilt and embroidered"
35378,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"into consequence. Then as to the versification it was, to say no worse of"
35379,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"it, execrable: it had neither the copious flow of Ferdosi, the sweetness"
35380,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"of Hafez, nor the sententious march of Sadi; but appeared to him in the"
35381,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],uneasy heaviness of its movements to have been modelled upon the gait of a
35382,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],very tired dromedary. The licenses too in which it indulged were
35383,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"unpardonable;--for instance this line, and the poem abounded with such;--"
35384,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
35385,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Like the faint, exquisite music of a dream."

35390,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],audience were asleep; while the glimmering lamps seemed inclined to follow
35391,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"their example. It became necessary therefore, however painful to himself,"
35392,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],to put an end to his valuable animadversions for the present and he
35393,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"accordingly concluded with an air of dignified candor, thus:--"

35395,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"""Notwithstanding the observations which I have thought it my duty to make,"
35396,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],it is by no means my wish to discourage the young man:--so far from it
35397,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],indeed that if he will but totally alter his style of writing and thinking
35398,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"I have very little doubt that I shall be vastly pleased with him."""
35399,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
35400,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Some days elapsed after this harangue of the Great Chamberlain before
35401,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],LALLA ROOKH could venture to ask for another story. The youth was still a
35402,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],welcome guest in the pavilion--to _one_ heart perhaps too dangerously
35403,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],welcome;--but all mention of poetry was as if by common consent avoided.
35404,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Though none of the party had much respect for FADLADEEN, yet his censures"
35405,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],thus magisterially delivered evidently made an impression on them all. The
35406,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Poet himself to whom criticism was quite a new operation, (being wholly"
35407,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"unknown in that Paradise of the Indies, Cashmere,) felt the shock as it is"
35408,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"generally felt at first, till use has made it more tolerable to the"
35409,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],patient;--the Ladies began to suspect that they ought not to be pleased
35410,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],and seemed to conclude that there must have been much good sense in what
35411,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],FADLADEEN said from its having set them all so soundly to sleep;--while
35412,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],the self-complacent Chamberlain was left to triumph in the idea of having
35413,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],for the hundred and fiftieth time in his life extinguished a Poet. LALLA
35414,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],ROOKH alone--and Love knew why--persisted in being delighted with all she
35415,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],had heard and in resolving to hear more as speedily as possible. Her
35416,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],manner however of first returning to the subject was unlucky. It was while
35417,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],they rested during the heat of noon near a fountain on which some hand had
35418,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"rudely traced those well-known words from the Garden of Sadi.--""Many like"
35419,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"me have viewed this fountain, but they are gone and their eyes are closed"
35420,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"for ever!""--that she took occasion from the melancholy beauty of this"
35421,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"passage to dwell upon the charms of poetry in general. ""It is true,"" she"
35422,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"said, ""few poets can imitate that sublime bird which flies always in the"
35423,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],air and never touches the earth:[139]--it is only once in many ages a
35424,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Genius appears whose words, like those on the Written Mountain last for"
35425,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"ever:[140]--but still there are some as delightful perhaps, though not so"
35426,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"wonderful, who if not stars over our head are at least flowers along our"
35427,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],path and whose sweetness of the moment we ought gratefully to inhale
35428,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],without calling upon them for a brightness and a durability beyond their
35429,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"nature. In short,"" continued she, blushing as if conscious of being caught"
35430,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"in an oration, ""it is quite cruel that a poet cannot wander through his"
35431,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"regions of enchantment without having a critic for ever, like the old Man"
35432,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"of the Sea, upon his back!""[141]--FADLADEEN, it was plain took this last"
35433,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],luckless allusion to himself and would treasure it up in his mind as a
35434,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],whetstone for his next criticism. A sudden silence ensued; and the
35435,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"Princess, glancing a look at FERAMORZ, saw plainly she must wait for a"
35436,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],more courageous moment.
35437,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],
35438,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"But the glories of Nature and her wild, fragrant airs playing freshly over"
35439,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],the current of youthful spirits will soon heal even deeper wounds than the
35440,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"dull Fadladeens of this world can inflict. In an evening or two after,"
35441,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],they came to the small Valley of Gardens which had been planted by order
35442,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],of the Emperor for his favorite sister Rochinara during their progress to
35443,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Cashmere some years before; and never was there a more sparkling
35444,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],assemblage of sweets since the Gulzar-e-Irem or Rose-bower of Irem. Every
35445,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],precious flower was there to be found that poetry or love or religion has
35446,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],ever consecrated; from the dark hyacinth to which Hafez compares his
35447,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],mistress's hair to be _Cámalatá_ by whose rosy blossoms the heaven of
35448,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],Indra is scented.[142] As they sat in the cool fragrance of this
35449,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],delicious spot and LALLA ROOKH remarked that she could fancy it the abode
35450,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"of that flower-loving Nymph whom they worship in the temples of Kathay,"
35451,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"[143] or of one of those Peris, those beautiful creatures of the air who"
35452,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],live upon perfumes and to whom a place like this might make some amends
35453,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"for the Paradise they have lost,--the young Poet in whose eyes she"
35454,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],appeared while she spoke to be one of the bright spiritual creatures she
35455,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"was describing said hesitatingly that he remembered a Story of a Peri,"
35456,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"which if the Princess had no objection he would venture to relate. ""It"
35457,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"is,"" said he, with an appealing look to FADLADEEN, ""in a lighter and"
35458,THE VEILED PROPHET OF KHORASSAN.[24],"humbler strain than the other:"" then, striking a few careless but"

35503,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Blooms nowhere but in Paradise.[146]
35504,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35505,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Nymph of a fair but erring line!"""
35506,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Gently he said--""One hope is thine."

35512,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"'Tis sweet to let the Pardoned in."""
35513,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35514,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Rapidly as comets run

35516,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Fleeter than the starry brands
35517,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Flung at night from angel hands[147]
35518,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,At those dark and daring sprites
35519,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Who would climb the empyreal heights,"
35520,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Down the blue vault the PERI flies,"
35521,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And lighted earthward by a glance

35523,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Hung hovering o'er our world's expanse.
35524,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35525,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,But whither shall the Spirit go

35531,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Many a fathom down in the sea,"
35532,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,To the south of sun-bright ARABY;[150]
35533,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,I know too where the Genii hid

35535,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""With Life's elixir sparkling high--"
35536,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""But gifts like these are not for the sky."

35541,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35542,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,While thus she mused her pinions fanned
35543,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The air of that sweet Indian land
35544,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Whose air is balm, whose ocean spreads"
35545,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"O'er coral rocks and amber beds,[152]"
35546,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Whose mountains pregnant by the beam

35548,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Whose rivulets are like rich brides,"
35549,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Lovely, with gold beneath their tides,"
35550,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Whose sandal groves and bowers of spice
35551,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Might be a Peri's Paradise!
35552,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,But crimson now her rivers ran
35553,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,With human blood--the smell of death
35554,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Came reeking from those spicy bowers,"
35555,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And man the sacrifice of man
35556,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Mingled his taint with every breath
35557,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Upwafted from the innocent flowers.
35558,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Land of the Sun! what foot invades
35559,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Thy Pagods and thy pillared shades--
35560,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Thy cavern shrines and Idol stones,"
35561,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Thy Monarch and their thousand Thrones?[153]

35566,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"His bloodhounds he adorns with gems,"
35567,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Torn from the violated necks
35568,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Of many a young and loved Sultana;[155]
35569,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Maidens within their pure Zenana,"
35570,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Priests in the very fane he slaughters,"
35571,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And chokes up with the glittering wrecks
35572,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Of golden shrines the sacred waters!
35573,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Downward the PERI turns her gaze,"
35574,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And thro' the war-field's bloody haze
35575,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Beholds a youthful warrior stand
35576,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Alone beside his native river,--"
35577,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The red blade broken in his hand
35578,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And the last arrow in his quiver.
35579,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Live,"" said the Conqueror, ""live to share"
35580,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""The trophies and the crowns I bear!"""
35581,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Silent that youthful warrior stood--
35582,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Silent he pointed to the flood
35583,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"All crimson with his country's blood,"
35584,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Then sent his last remaining dart,"
35585,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"For answer, to the Invader's heart."
35586,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35587,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,False flew the shaft tho' pointed well;

35589,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Yet marked the PERI where he lay,"
35590,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And when the rush of war was past
35591,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Swiftly descending on a ray
35592,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Of morning light she caught the last--
35593,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Last glorious drop his heart had shed
35594,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Before its free-born spirit fled!
35595,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35596,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Be this,"" she cried, as she winged her flight,"

35616,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Her first fond hope of Eden blighted,"
35617,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Now among AFRIC'S lunar Mountains[156]
35618,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Far to the South the PERI lighted
35619,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And sleeked her plumage at the fountains
35620,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Of that Egyptian tide whose birth
35621,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Is hidden from the sons of earth
35622,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Deep in those solitary woods
35623,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Where oft the Genii of the Floods
35624,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Dance round the cradle of their Nile
35625,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And hail the new-born Giant's smile.[157]
35626,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Thence over EGYPT'S palmy groves
35627,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Her grots, and sepulchres of Kings,[158]"
35628,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The exiled Spirit sighing roves
35629,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And now hangs listening to the doves
35630,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,In warm ROSETTA'S vale;[159] now loves
35631,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,To watch the moonlight on the wings
35632,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Of the white pelicans that break
35633,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The azure calm of MOERIS' Lake.[160]
35634,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,'Twas a fair scene: a Land more bright
35635,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Never did mortal eye behold!
35636,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Who could have thought that saw this night

35638,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Basking in Heaven's serenest light,"
35639,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Those groups of lovely date-trees bending
35640,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Languidly their leaf-crowned heads,"

35642,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Warns them to their silken beds,[161]"
35643,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Those virgin lilies all the night
35644,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Bathing their beauties in the lake
35645,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"That they may rise more fresh and bright,"
35646,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"When their beloved Sun's awake,"
35647,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Those ruined shrines and towers that seem
35648,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"The relics of a splendid dream,"
35649,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Amid whose fairy loneliness
35650,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Naught but the lapwing's cry is heard,--"
35651,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Naught seen but (when the shadows flitting,"
35652,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Fast from the moon unsheath its gleam,)"
35653,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Some purple-winged Sultana sitting[162]
35654,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Upon a column motionless

35656,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Who could have thought that there, even there,"

35658,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The Demon of the Plague hath cast

35663,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Of human shape touched by his wing,"
35664,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Like plants, where the Simoom hath past"
35665,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,At once falls black and withering!
35666,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The sun went down on many a brow
35667,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Which, full of bloom and freshness then,"
35668,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Is rankling in the pest-house now
35669,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"And ne'er will feel that sun again,"
35670,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"And, oh! to see the unburied heaps"
35671,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,On which the lonely moonlight sleeps--
35672,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"The very vultures turn away,"
35673,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And sicken at so foul a prey!
35674,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Only the fierce hyaena stalks[163]
35675,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Throughout the city's desolate walks[164]
35676,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,At midnight and his carnage plies:--
35677,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Woe to the half-dead wretch who meets
35678,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The glaring of those large blue eyes
35679,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Amid the darkness of the streets!
35680,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35681,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Poor race of men!"" said the pitying Spirit,"
35682,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Dearly ye pay for your primal Fall--"

35684,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""But the trail of the Serpent is over them all!"""
35685,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,She wept--the air grew pure and clear
35686,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Around her as the bright drops ran,"
35687,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,For there's a magic in each tear
35688,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Such kindly Spirits weep for man!
35689,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35690,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Just then beneath some orange trees
35691,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Whose fruit and blossoms in the breeze
35692,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Were wantoning together, free,"
35693,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Like age at play with infancy--
35694,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Beneath that fresh and springing bower
35695,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Close by the Lake she heard the moan
35696,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Of one who at this silent hour,"
35697,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Had thither stolen to die alone.
35698,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"One who in life where'er he moved,"
35699,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Drew after him the hearts of many;
35700,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Yet now, as tho' he ne'er were loved,"
35701,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Dies here unseen, unwept by any!"
35702,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,None to watch near him--none to slake
35703,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"The fire that in his bosom lies,"
35704,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,With even a sprinkle from that lake
35705,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Which shines so cool before his eyes.
35706,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,No voice well known thro' many a day
35707,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"To speak the last, the parting word"
35708,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Which when all other sounds decay
35709,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Is still like distant music heard;--
35710,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,That tender farewell on the shore
35711,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Of this rude world when all is o'er,"
35712,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Which cheers the spirit ere its bark
35713,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Puts off into the unknown Dark.
35714,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35715,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Deserted youth! one thought alone
35716,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Shed joy around his soul in death
35717,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"That she whom he for years had known,"
35718,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And loved and might have called his own
35719,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Was safe from this foul midnight's breath,--"
35720,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Safe in her father's princely halls
35721,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Where the cool airs from fountain falls,"
35722,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Freshly perfumed by many a brand
35723,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Of the sweet wood from India's land,"
35724,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Were pure as she whose brow they fanned.
35725,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35726,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"But see--who yonder comes by stealth,"
35727,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"This melancholy bower to seek,"
35728,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Like a young envoy sent by Health
35729,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,With rosy gifts upon her cheek?
35730,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"'Tis she--far off, thro' moonlight dim"
35731,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"He knew his own betrothed bride,"
35732,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,She who would rather die with him
35733,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Than live to gain the world beside!--
35734,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Her arms are round her lover now,"
35735,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,His livid cheek to hers she presses
35736,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And dips to bind his burning brow
35737,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,In the cool lake her loosened tresses.
35738,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Ah! once, how little did he think"
35739,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,An hour would come when he should shrink
35740,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"With horror from that dear embrace,"
35741,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Those gentle arms that were to him
35742,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Holy as is the cradling place
35743,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Of Eden's infant cherubim!
35744,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"And now he yields--now turns away,"
35745,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Shuddering as if the venom lay
35746,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,All in those proffered lips alone--
35747,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Those lips that then so fearless grown
35748,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Never until that instant came
35749,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Near his unasked or without shame.
35750,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Oh! let me only breathe the air."
35751,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""The blessed air, that's breathed by thee,"
35752,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""And whether on its wings it bear"
35753,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Healing or death 'tis sweet to me!"
35754,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""There--drink my tears while yet they fall--"
35755,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Would that my bosom's blood were balm,"
35756,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""And, well thou knowst, I'd shed it all"
35757,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""To give thy brow one minute's calm."
35758,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Nay, turn not from me that dear face--"

35760,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""The one, the chosen one, whose place"
35761,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""In life or death is by thy side?"
35762,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Thinkst thou that she whose only light,"
35763,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""In this dim world from thee hath shone"
35764,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Could bear the long, the cheerless night"
35765,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""That must be hers when thou art gone?"
35766,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""That I can live and let thee go,"

35769,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Out of its heart must perish too!"
35770,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Then turn to me, my own love, turn,"
35771,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Before, like thee, I fade and burn;"
35772,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Cling to these yet cool lips and share"
35773,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""The last pure life that lingers there!"""
35774,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,She fails--she sinks--as dies the lamp
35775,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"In charnel airs or cavern-damp,"
35776,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,So quickly do his baleful sighs
35777,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Quench all the sweet light of her eyes,"
35778,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,One struggle--and his pain is past--
35779,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Her lover is no longer living!
35780,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"One kiss the maiden gives, one last,"
35781,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Long kiss, which she expires in giving!"
35782,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35783,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Sleep,"" said the PERI, as softly she stole"
35784,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"The farewell sigh of that vanishing soul,"

35786,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Sleep on, in visions of odor rest"
35787,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""In balmier airs than ever yet stirred"

35789,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Who sings at the last his own death-lay[165]"
35790,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""And in music and perfume dies away!"""
35791,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Thus saying, from her lips she spread"
35792,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Unearthly breathings thro' the place
35793,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And shook her sparkling wreath and shed
35794,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Such lustre o'er each paly face
35795,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"That like two lovely saints they seemed,"
35796,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Upon the eve of doomsday taken
35797,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,From their dim graves in ordor sleeping;
35798,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,While that benevolent PERI beamed
35799,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Like their good angel calmly keeping
35800,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Watch o'er them till their souls would waken.
35801,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35802,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,But morn is blushing in the sky;
35803,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Again the PERI soars above,"
35804,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Bearing to Heaven that precious sigh
35805,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Of pure, self-sacrificing love."
35806,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,High throbbed her heart with hope elate
35807,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The Elysian palm she soon shall win.
35808,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,For the bright Spirit at the gate
35809,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Smiled as she gave that offering in;
35810,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And she already hears the trees
35811,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Of Eden with their crystal bells
35812,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Ringing in that ambrosial breeze
35813,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,That from the throne of ALLA swells;
35814,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And she can see the starry bowls
35815,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,That lie around that lucid lake
35816,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Upon whose banks admitted Souls
35817,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Their first sweet draught of glory take![166]

35819,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"But, ah! even PERIS' hopes are vain--"
35820,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Again the Fates forbade, again"
35821,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"The immortal barrier closed--""Not yet,"""
35822,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The Angel said as with regret
35823,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,He shut from her that glimpse of glory--
35824,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""True was the maiden, and her story"
35825,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Written in light o'er ALLA'S head"
35826,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""By seraph eyes shall long be read."
35827,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""But, PERI, see--the crystal bar"
35828,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Of Eden moves not--holier far"
35829,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Than even this sigh the boon must be"
35830,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""That opes the Gates of Heaven for thee."""
35831,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35832,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Now upon SYRIA'S land of roses[167]
35833,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Softly the light of Eve reposes,"
35834,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And like a glory the broad sun
35835,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Hangs over sainted LEBANON,"
35836,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Whose head in wintry grandeur towers
35837,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"And whitens with eternal sleet,"
35838,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,While summer in a vale of flowers
35839,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Is sleeping rosy at his feet.
35840,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35841,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,To one who looked from upper air
35842,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"O'er all the enchanted regions there,"
35843,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"How beauteous must have been the glow,"
35844,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"The life, the sparkling from below!"
35845,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Fair gardens, shining streams, with ranks"
35846,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Of golden melons on their banks,"
35847,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,More golden where the sunlight falls;--
35848,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Gay lizards, glittering on the walls[168]"
35849,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Of ruined shrines, busy and bright"
35850,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,As they were all alive with light;
35851,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And yet more splendid numerous flocks
35852,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Of pigeons settling on the rocks
35853,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,With their rich restless wings that gleam
35854,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Variously in the crimson beam
35855,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Of the warm West,--as if inlaid"
35856,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,With brilliants from the mine or made
35857,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Of tearless rainbows such as span
35858,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The unclouded skies of PERISTAN.
35859,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"And then the mingling sounds that come,"
35860,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Of shepherd's ancient reed,[169] with hum"
35861,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Of the wild bees of PALESTINE,[170]"
35862,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Banqueting thro' the flowery vales;
35863,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"And, JORDAN, those sweet banks of thine"
35864,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And woods so full of nightingales.[171]
35865,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,But naught can charm the luckless PERI;
35866,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Her soul is sad--her wings are weary--
35867,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Joyless she sees the Sun look down
35868,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"On that great Temple once his own,[172]"
35869,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Whose lonely columns stand sublime,"
35870,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Flinging their shadows from on high
35871,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Like dials which the Wizard Time
35872,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Had raised to count his ages by!
35873,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35874,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Yet haply there may lie concealed
35875,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Beneath those Chambers of the Sun
35876,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Some amulet of gems, annealed"
35877,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"In upper fires, some tablet sealed"
35878,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"With the great name of SOLOMON,"
35879,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Which spelled by her illumined eyes,"
35880,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"May teach her where beneath the moon,"
35881,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"In earth or ocean, lies the boon,"
35882,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"The charm, that can restore so soon"
35883,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,An erring Spirit to the skies.
35884,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35885,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Cheered by this hope she bends her thither;--
35886,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Still laughs the radiant eye of Heaven,"
35887,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Nor have the golden bowers of Even
35888,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,In the rich West begun to wither;--
35889,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,When o'er the vale of BALBEC winging
35890,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Slowly she sees a child at play,"
35891,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Among the rosy wild flowers singing,"
35892,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,As rosy and as wild as they;
35893,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Chasing with eager hands and eyes
35894,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"The beautiful blue damsel-flies,[173]"
35895,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,That fluttered round the jasmine stems
35896,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Like winged flowers or flying gems:--
35897,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"And near the boy, who tired with play"
35898,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Now nestling mid the roses lay.
35899,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,She saw a wearied man dismount
35900,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,From his hot steed and on the brink
35901,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Of a small imaret's rustic fount
35902,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Impatient fling him down to drink.
35903,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Then swift his haggard brow he turned
35904,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"To the fair child who fearless sat,"
35905,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Tho' never yet hath day-beam burned
35906,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Upon a brow more fierce than that,--"
35907,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Sullenly fierce--a mixture dire
35908,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Like thunder-clouds of gloom and fire;
35909,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,In which the PERI'S eye could read
35910,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Dark tales of many a ruthless deed;
35911,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The ruined maid--the shrine profaned--
35912,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Oaths broken--and the threshold stained
35913,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"With blood of guests!--_there_ written, all,"
35914,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Black as the damning drops that fall
35915,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"From the denouncing Angel's pen,"
35916,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Ere Mercy weeps them out again.
35917,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Yet tranquil now that man of crime
35918,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,(As if the balmy evening time
35919,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Softened his spirit) looked and lay,"
35920,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Watching the rosy infant's play:--
35921,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Tho' still whene'er his eye by chance
35922,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Fell on the boy's, its lucid glance"
35923,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Met that unclouded, joyous gaze,"
35924,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,As torches that have burnt all night
35925,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Tho' some impure and godless rite,"
35926,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Encounter morning's glorious rays.
35927,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35928,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"But, hark! the vesper call to prayer,"
35929,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"As slow the orb of daylight sets,"
35930,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Is rising sweetly on the air.
35931,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,From SYRIA'S thousand minarets!
35932,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The boy has started from the bed
35933,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Of flowers where he had laid his head.
35934,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And down upon the fragrant sod
35935,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Kneels[174] with his forehead to the south
35936,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Lisping the eternal name of God
35937,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"From Purity's own cherub mouth,"
35938,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And looking while his hands and eyes
35939,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Are lifted to the glowing skies
35940,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Like a stray babe of Paradise
35941,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Just lighted on that flowery plain
35942,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And seeking for its home again.
35943,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Oh! 'twas a sight--that Heaven--that child--
35944,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"A scene, which might have well beguiled"
35945,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Even haughty EBLIS of a sigh
35946,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,For glories lost and peace gone by!
35947,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"And how felt _he_, the wretched Man"
35948,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Reclining there--while memory ran
35949,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"O'er many a year of guilt and strife,"
35950,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Flew o'er the dark flood of his life,"
35951,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Nor found one sunny resting-place.
35952,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Nor brought him back one branch of grace.
35953,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""There _was_ a time,"" he said, in mild,"
35954,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Heart-humbled tones--""thou blessed child!"
35955,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""When young and haply pure as thou"
35956,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""I looked and prayed like thee--but now""--"
35957,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,He hung his head--each nobler aim
35958,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And hope and feeling which had slept
35959,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,From boyhood's hour that instant came
35960,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Fresh o'er him and he wept--he wept!
35961,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35962,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Blest tears of soul-felt penitence!
35963,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"In whose benign, redeeming flow"
35964,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Is felt the first, the only sense"
35965,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Of guiltless joy that guilt can know.
35966,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""There's a drop,"" said the PERI, ""that down from the moon"
35967,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Falls thro' the withering airs of June"
35968,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Upon EGYPT'S land,[175] of so healing a power,"
35969,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""So balmy a virtue, that even in the hour"
35970,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""That drop descends contagion dies"
35971,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""And health reanimates earth and skies!--"
35972,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Oh, is it not thus, thou man of sin,"
35973,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""The precious tears of repentance fall?"
35974,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Tho' foul thy fiery plagues within"
35975,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""One heavenly drop hath dispelled them all!"""
35976,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And now--behold him kneeling there
35977,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"By the child's side, in humble prayer,"
35978,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,While the same sunbeam shines upon
35979,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The guilty and the guiltless one.
35980,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,And hymns of joy proclaim thro' Heaven
35981,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The triumph of a Soul Forgiven!
35982,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35983,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"'Twas when the golden orb had set,"
35984,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"While on their knees they lingered yet,"
35985,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,There fell a light more lovely far
35986,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Than ever came from sun or star,"
35987,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Upon the tear that, warm and meek,"
35988,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Dewed that repentant sinner's cheek.
35989,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,To mortal eye this light might seem
35990,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,A northern flash or meteor beam--
35991,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,But well the enraptured PERI knew
35992,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,'Twas a bright smile the Angel threw
35993,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,From Heaven's gate to hail that tear
35994,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Her harbinger of glory near!
35995,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
35996,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Joy, joy for ever! my task is done--"
35997,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""The Gates are past and Heaven is won!"
35998,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Oh! am I not happy? I am, I am--"
35999,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""To thee, sweet Eden! how dark and sad"
36000,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Are the diamond turrets of SHADUKIAM,[176]"
36001,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""And the fragrant bowers of AMBERABAD!"
36002,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36003,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Farewell ye odors of Earth that die"
36004,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Passing away like a lover's sigh;--"
36005,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""My feast is now of the Tooba Tree[177]"
36006,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Whose scent is the breath of Eternity!"
36007,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36008,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Farewell, ye vanishing flowers that shone"
36009,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""In my fairy wreath so bright an' brief;--"
36010,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Oh! what are the brightest that e'er have blown"
36011,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""To the lote-tree springing by ALLA'S throne[178]"
36012,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Whose flowers have a soul in every leaf."
36013,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""Joy, joy for ever.--my task is done--"
36014,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""The Gates are past and Heaven is won!"""
36015,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36016,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36017,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""And this,"" said the Great Chamberlain, ""is poetry! this flimsy"
36018,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"manufacture of the brain, which in comparison with the lofty and durable"
36019,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,monuments of genius is as the gold filigree-work of Zamara beside the
36020,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"eternal architecture of Egypt!"" After this gorgeous sentence, which, with"
36021,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"a few more of the same kind, FADLADEEN kept by him for rare and important"
36022,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"occasions, he proceeded to the anatomy of the short poem just recited. The"
36023,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"lax and easy kind of metre in which it was written ought to be denounced,"
36024,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"he said, as one of the leading causes of the alarming growth of poetry in"
36025,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,our times. If some check were not given to this lawless facility we should
36026,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,soon be overrun by a race of bards as numerous and as shallow as the
36027,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,hundred and twenty thousand Streams of Basra.[179] They who succeeded in
36028,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,this style deserved chastisement for their very success;--as warriors have
36029,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,been punished even after gaining a victory because they had taken the
36030,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,liberty of gaining it in an irregular or unestablished manner. What then
36031,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,was to be said to those who failed? to those who presumed as in the
36032,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,present lamentable instance to imitate the licence and ease of the bolder
36033,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,sons of song without any of that grace or vigor which gave a dignity even
36034,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"to negligence;--who like them flung the jereed[180] carelessly, but not,"
36035,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"like them, to the mark;--""and who,"" said he, raising his voice to excite a"
36036,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"proper degree of wakefulness in his hearers, ""contrive to appear heavy and"
36037,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"constrained in the midst of all the latitude they allow themselves, like"
36038,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"one of those young pagans that dance before the Princess, who is ingenious"
36039,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"enough to move as if her limbs were fettered, in a pair of the lightest"
36040,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"and loosest drawers of Masulipatam!"""
36041,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36042,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"It was but little suitable, he continued, to the grave march of criticism"
36043,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"to follow this fantastical Peri of whom they had just heard, through all"
36044,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"her flights and adventures between earth and heaven, but he could not help"
36045,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,adverting to the puerile conceitedness of the Three Gifts which she is
36046,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"supposed to carry to the skies,--a drop of blood, forsooth, a sigh, and a"
36047,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,tear! How the first of these articles was delivered into the Angel's
36048,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"""radiant hand"" he professed himself at a loss to discover; and as to the"
36049,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"safe carriage of the sigh and the tear, such Peris and such poets were"
36050,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,beings by far too incomprehensible for him even to guess how they managed
36051,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"such matters. ""But, in short,"" said he, ""it is a waste of time and"
36052,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"patience to dwell longer upon a thing so incurably frivolous,--puny even"
36053,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"among its own puny race, and such as only the Banyan Hospital[181] for"
36054,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Sick Insects should undertake."""
36055,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36056,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,In vain did LALLA ROOKH try to soften this inexorable critic; in vain did
36057,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"she resort to her most eloquent commonplaces, reminding him that poets"
36058,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,were a timid and sensitive race whose sweetness was not to be drawn forth
36059,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,like that of the fragrant grass near the Ganges by crushing and trampling
36060,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"upon them,[182] that severity often extinguished every chance of the"
36061,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"perfection which it demanded, and that after all perfection was like the"
36062,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Mountain of the Talisman,--no one had ever yet reached its summit.[183]"
36063,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Neither these gentle axioms nor the still gentler looks with which they
36064,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,were inculcated could lower for one instant the elevation of FADLADEEN'S
36065,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,eyebrows or charm him into anything like encouragement or even toleration
36066,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"of her poet. Toleration, indeed, was not among the weaknesses of"
36067,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,FADLADEEN:--he carried the same spirit into matters of poetry and of
36068,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"religion, and though little versed in the beauties or sublimities of"
36069,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,either was a perfect master of the art of persecution in both. His zeal
36070,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"was the same too in either pursuit, whether the game before him was pagans"
36071,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"or poetasters, worshippers of cows, or writers of epics."
36072,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36073,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,They had now arrived at the splendid city of Lahore whose mausoleums and
36074,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"shrines, magnificent and numberless where Death appeared to share equal"
36075,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,honors with Heaven would have powerfully affected the heart and
36076,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"imagination of LALLA ROOKH, if feelings more of this earth had not taken"
36077,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,entire possession of her already. She was here met by messengers
36078,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,despatched from Cashmere who informed her that the King had arrived in the
36079,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Valley and was himself superintending the sumptuous preparations that were
36080,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,then making in the Saloons of the Shalimar for her reception. The chill
36081,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"she felt on receiving this intelligence,--which to a bride whose heart was"
36082,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,free and light would have brought only images of affection and
36083,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"pleasure,--convinced her that her peace was gone for ever and that she was"
36084,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"in love, irretrievably in love, with young FERAMORZ. The veil had fallen"
36085,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"off in which this passion at first disguises itself, and to know that she"
36086,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,loved was now as painful as to love without knowing it had been delicious.
36087,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"FERAMORZ, too,--what misery would be his, if the sweet hours of"
36088,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,intercourse so imprudently allowed them should have stolen into his heart
36089,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"the same fatal fascination as into hers;--if, notwithstanding her rank and"
36090,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"the modest homage he always paid to it, even _he_ should have yielded to"
36091,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"the influence of those long and happy interviews where music, poetry, the"
36092,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"delightful scenes of nature,--all had tended to bring their hearts close"
36093,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,together and to waken by every means that too ready passion which often
36094,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,like the young of the desert-bird is warmed into life by the eyes alone!
36095,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,[184] She saw but one way to preserve herself from being culpable as well
36096,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"as unhappy, and this however painful she was resolved to adopt. FERAMORZ"
36097,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,must no more be admitted to her presence. To have strayed so far into the
36098,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"dangerous labyrinth was wrong, but to linger in it while the clew was yet"
36099,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,in her hand would be criminal. Though the heart she had to offer to the
36100,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"King of Bucharia might be cold and broken, it should at least be pure, and"
36101,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,she must only endeavor to forget the short dream of happiness she had
36102,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"enjoyed,--like that Arabian shepherd who in wandering into the wilderness"
36103,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,caught a glimpse of the Gardens of Irim and then lost them again for ever!
36104,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36105,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The arrival of the young Bride at Lahore was celebrated in the most
36106,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"enthusiastic manner. The Rajas and Omras in her train, who had kept at a"
36107,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,certain distance during the journey and never encamped nearer to the
36108,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Princess than was strictly necessary for her safeguard here rode in
36109,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,splendid cavalcade through the city and distributed the most costly
36110,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,presents to the crowd. Engines were erected in all the squares which cast
36111,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"forth showers of confectionery among the people, while the artisans in"
36112,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,chariots[185] adorned with tinsel and flying streamers exhibited the
36113,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,badges of their respective trades through the streets. Such brilliant
36114,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,displays of life and pageantry among the palaces and domes and gilded
36115,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,minarets of Lahore made the city altogether like a place of
36116,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,enchantment;--particularly on the day when LALLA ROOKH set out again upon
36117,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"her journey, when she was accompanied to the gate by all the fairest and"
36118,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,richest of the nobility and rode along between ranks of beautiful boys and
36119,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,girls who kept waving over their heads plates of gold and silver
36120,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"flowers,[186] and then threw them around to be gathered by the populace."
36121,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36122,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,For many days after their departure from Lahore a considerable degree of
36123,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"gloom hung over the whole party. LALLA ROOKH, who had intended to make"
36124,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"illness her excuse for not admitting the young minstrel, as usual, to the"
36125,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"pavilion, soon found that to feign indisposition was unnecessary;--"
36126,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,FADLADEEN felt the loss of the good road they had hitherto travelled and
36127,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,was very near cursing Jehan-Guire (of blessed memory!) for not having
36128,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,continued his delectable alley of trees[187] a least as far as the
36129,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,mountains of Cashmere;--while the Ladies who had nothing now to do all day
36130,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,but to be fanned by peacocks' feathers and listen to FADLADEEN seemed
36131,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,heartily weary of the life they led and in spite of all the Great
36132,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Chamberlain's criticisms were so tasteless as to wish for the poet again.
36133,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,One evening as they were proceeding to their place of rest for the night
36134,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,the Princess who for the freer enjoyment of the air had mounted her
36135,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"favorite Arabian palfrey, in passing by a small grove heard the notes of a"
36136,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,lute from within its leaves and a voice which she but too well knew
36137,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,singing the following words:--
36138,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36139,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Tell me not of joys above,"
36140,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"If that world can give no bliss,"
36141,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Truer, happier than the Love"
36142,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Which enslaves our souls in this.
36143,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36144,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Tell me not of Houris' eyes;--
36145,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Far from me their dangerous glow.
36146,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,If those looks that light the skies
36147,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Wound like some that burn below.
36148,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36149,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Who that feels what Love is here,"
36150,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,All its falsehood--all its pain--
36151,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Would, for even Elysium's sphere,"
36152,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Risk the fatal dream again?
36153,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36154,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Who that midst a desert's heat
36155,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Sees the waters fade away
36156,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Would not rather die than meet
36157,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Streams again as false as they?
36158,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36159,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The tone of melancholy defiance in which these words were uttered went to
36160,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,LALLA ROOKH'S heart;--and as she reluctantly rode on she could not help
36161,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,feeling it to be a sad but still sweet certainty that FERAMORZ was to the
36162,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,full as enamored and miserable as herself.
36163,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36164,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,The place where they encamped that evening was the first delightful spot
36165,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,they had come to since they left Lahore. On one side of them was a grove
36166,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,full of small Hindoo temples and planted with the most graceful trees of
36167,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"the East, where the tamarind, the cassia, and the silken plantains of"
36168,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Ceylon were mingled in rich contrast with the high fan-like foliage of the
36169,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Palmyra,--that favorite tree of the luxurious bird that lights up the"
36170,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,chambers of its nest with fire-flies.[188]. In the middle of the lawn
36171,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,where the pavilion stood there was a tank surrounded by small mango-trees
36172,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,on the clear cold waters of which floated multitudes of the beautiful red
36173,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"lotus,[189] while at a distance stood the ruins of a strange and awful-"
36174,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,looking tower which seemed old enough to have been the temple of some
36175,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,religion no longer known and which spoke the voice of desolation in the
36176,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,midst of all that bloom and loveliness. This singular ruin excited the
36177,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"wonder and conjectures of all. LALLA ROOKH guessed in vain, and the all-"
36178,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,pretending FADLADEEN who had never till this journey been beyond the
36179,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,precincts of Delhi was proceeding most learnedly to show that he knew
36180,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"nothing whatever about the matter, when one of the Ladies suggested that"
36181,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,perhaps FERAMORZ could satisfy their curiosity. They were now approaching
36182,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,his native mountains and this tower might perhaps be a relic of some of
36183,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,those dark superstitions which had prevailed in that country before the
36184,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,light of Islam dawned upon it. The Chamberlain who usually preferred his
36185,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,own ignorance to the best knowledge that any one else could give him was
36186,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"by no means pleased with this officious reference, and the Princess too"
36187,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"was about to interpose a faint word of objection, but before either of"
36188,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"them could speak a slave was despatched for FERAMORZ, who in a very few"
36189,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,minutes made his appearance before them--looking so pale and unhappy in
36190,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,LALLA ROOKH'S eyes that she repented already of her cruelty in having so
36191,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,long excluded him.
36192,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36193,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,That venerable tower he told them was the remains of an ancient Fire-
36194,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"Temple, built by those Ghebers or Persians of the old religion, who many"
36195,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"hundred years since had fled hither from the Arab conquerors, preferring"
36196,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,liberty and their altars in a foreign land to the alternative of apostasy
36197,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"or persecution in their own. It was impossible, he added, not to feel"
36198,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,interested in the many glorious but unsuccessful struggles which had been
36199,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,made by these original natives of Persia to cast off the yoke of their
36200,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,bigoted conquerors. Like their own Fire in the Burning Field at Bakou when
36201,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,suppressed in one place they had but broken out with fresh flame in
36202,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"another; and as a native of Cashmere, of that fair and Holy Valley which"
36203,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,had in the same manner become the prey of strangers[190] and seen her
36204,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,ancient shrines and native princes swept away before the march of her
36205,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"intolerant invaders he felt a sympathy, he owned, with the sufferings of"
36206,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,the persecuted Ghebers which every monument like this before them but
36207,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,tended more powerfully to awaken.
36208,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36209,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,It was the first time that FERAMORZ had ever ventured upon so much
36210,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,_prose_ before FADLADEEN and it may easily be conceived what effect such
36211,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,prose as this must have produced upon that most orthodox and most pagan-
36212,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"hating personage. He sat for some minutes aghast, ejaculating only at"
36213,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"intervals, ""Bigoted conquerors!--sympathy with Fire-worshippers!""[191]--"
36214,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,while FERAMORZ happy to take advantage of this almost speechless horror of
36215,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,the Chamberlain proceeded to say that he knew a melancholy story connected
36216,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,with the events of one of those struggles of the brave Fire-worshippers
36217,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"against their Arab masters, which if the evening was not too far advanced"
36218,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,he should have much pleasure in being allowed to relate to the Princess.
36219,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,It was impossible for LALLA ROOKH to refuse;--he had never before looked
36220,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"half so animated, and when he spoke of the Holy Valley his eyes had"
36221,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,sparkled she thought like the talismanic characters on the scimitar of
36222,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,Solomon. Her consent was therefore most readily granted; and while
36223,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"FADLADEEN sat in unspeakable dismay, expecting treason and abomination in"
36224,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,"every line, the poet thus began his story of the Fire-worshippers:"
36225,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36226,PARADISE AND THE PERI.,
36227,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.
36228,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36229,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36230,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,'Tis moonlight over OMAN'S SEA;[192]
36231,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Her banks of pearl and palmy isles
36232,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Bask in the night-beam beauteously
36233,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And her blue waters sleep in smiles.
36234,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"'Tis moonlight in HARMOZIA'S[193] walls,"
36235,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And through her EMIR'S porphyry halls
36236,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Where some hours since was heard the swell
36237,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of trumpets and the clash of zel[194]
36238,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Bidding the bright-eyed sun farewell;--
36239,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The peaceful sun whom better suits
36240,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The music of the bulbul's nest
36241,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Or the light touch of lovers' lutes
36242,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To sing him to his golden rest.
36243,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,All husht--there's not a breeze in motion;
36244,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The shore is silent as the ocean.
36245,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"If zephyrs come, so light they come."
36246,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Nor leaf is stirred nor wave is driven;--
36247,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The wind-tower on the EMIR'S dome[195]
36248,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Can hardly win a breath from heaven.
36249,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36250,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Even he, that tyrant Arab, sleeps"
36251,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Calm, while a nation round him weeps,"
36252,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,While curses load the air he breathes
36253,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And falchions from unnumbered sheaths
36254,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Are starting to avenge the shame
36255,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,His race hath brought on IRAN'S[196]name.
36256,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Hard, heartless Chief, unmoved alike"
36257,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Mid eyes that weep and swords that strike;
36258,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"One of that saintly, murderous brood,"
36259,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"To carnage and the Koran given,"
36260,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Who think thro' unbelievers' blood
36261,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Lies their directest path to heaven,--"
36262,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,One who will pause and kneel unshod
36263,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"In the warm blood his hand hath poured,"
36264,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To mutter o'er some text of God
36265,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Engraven on his reeking sword;[197]
36266,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Nay, who can coolly note the line,"
36267,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The letter of those words divine,"
36268,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To which his blade with searching art
36269,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Had sunk into its victim's heart!
36270,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36271,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Just ALLA! what must be thy look
36272,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When such a wretch before thee stands
36273,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Unblushing, with thy Sacred Book,--"
36274,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Turning the leaves with bloodstained hands,"
36275,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And wresting from its page sublime
36276,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,His creed of lust and hate and crime;--
36277,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Even as those bees of TREBIZOND,"
36278,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Which from the sunniest flowers that glad
36279,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"With their pure smile the gardens round,"
36280,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Draw venom forth that drives men mad.[198]
36281,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Never did fierce Arabia send
36282,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A satrap forth more direly great;
36283,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Never was IRAN doomed to bend
36284,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Beneath a yoke of deadlier weight.
36285,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Her throne had fallen--her pride was crusht--
36286,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Her sons were willing slaves, nor blusht,"
36287,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"In their own land,--no more their own,--"
36288,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To crouch beneath a stranger's throne.
36289,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Her towers where MITHRA once had burned.
36290,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"To Moslem shrines--oh shame!--were turned,"
36291,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Where slaves converted by the sword,"
36292,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Their mean, apostate worship poured,"
36293,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And curst the faith their sires adored.
36294,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Yet has she hearts, mid all this ill,"
36295,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,O'er all this wreck high buoyant still
36296,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With hope and vengeance;--hearts that yet--
36297,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Like gems, in darkness, issuing rays"
36298,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"They've treasured from the sun that's set,--"
36299,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Beam all the light of long-lost days!
36300,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And swords she hath, nor weak nor slow"
36301,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To second all such hearts can dare:
36302,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"As he shall know, well, dearly know."
36303,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Who sleeps in moonlight luxury there,"
36304,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Tranquil as if his spirit lay
36305,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Becalmed in Heaven's approving ray.
36306,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Sleep on--for purer eyes than thine
36307,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Those waves are husht, those planets shine;"
36308,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Sleep on and be thy rest unmoved
36309,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,By the white moonbeam's dazzling power;--
36310,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,None but the loving and the loved
36311,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Should be awake at this sweet hour.
36312,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36313,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And see--where high above those rocks
36314,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That o'er the deep their shadows fling.
36315,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Yon turret stands;--where ebon locks,"
36316,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As glossy as the heron's wing
36317,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Upon the turban of a king,[199]"
36318,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Hang from the lattice, long and wild,--"
36319,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"'Tis she, that EMIR'S blooming child,"
36320,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"All truth and tenderness and grace,"
36321,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Tho' born of such ungentle race;--
36322,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,An image of Youth's radiant Fountain
36323,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Springing in a desolate mountain![200]
36324,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36325,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Oh what a pure and sacred thing
36326,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Is Beauty curtained from the sight
36327,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of the gross world, illumining"
36328,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,One only mansion with her light!
36329,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Unseen by man's disturbing eye,--"
36330,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The flower that blooms beneath the sea,"
36331,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Too deep for sunbeams, doth not lie"
36332,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Hid in more chaste obscurity.
36333,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"So, HINDA. have thy face and mind,"
36334,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Like holy mysteries, lain enshrined."
36335,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And oh! what transport for a lover
36336,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To lift the veil that shades them o'er!--
36337,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Like those who all at once discover
36338,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In the lone deep some fairy shore
36339,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Where mortal never trod before,"
36340,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And sleep and wake in scented airs
36341,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,No lip had ever breathed but theirs.
36342,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36343,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Beautiful are the maids that glide
36344,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"On summer-eves thro' YEMEN'S[201] dales,"
36345,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And bright the glancing looks they hide
36346,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Behind their litters' roseate veils;--
36347,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And brides as delicate and fair
36348,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"As the white jasmine flowers they wear,"
36349,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Hath YEMEN in her blissful clime,"
36350,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Who lulled in cool kiosk or bower,[202]"
36351,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Before their mirrors count the time[203]
36352,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And grow still lovelier every hour.
36353,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But never yet hath bride or maid
36354,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In ARABY'S gay Haram smiled.
36355,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Whose boasted brightness would not fade
36356,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Before AL HASSAN'S blooming child.
36357,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36358,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Light as the angel shapes that bless
36359,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"An infant's dream, yet not the less"
36360,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Rich in all woman's loveliness;--
36361,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With eyes so pure that from their ray
36362,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Dark Vice would turn abasht away,"
36363,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Blinded like serpents when they gaze
36364,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Upon the emerald's virgin blaze;[204]--
36365,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Yet filled with all youth's sweet desires,"
36366,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Mingling the meek and vestal fires
36367,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of other worlds with all the bliss,"
36368,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The fond, weak tenderness of this:"
36369,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"A soul too more than half divine,"
36370,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Where, thro' some shades of earthly feeling,"
36371,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Religion's softened glories shine,"
36372,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Like light thro' summer foliage stealing,"
36373,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Shedding a glow of such mild hue,"
36374,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"So warm and yet so shadowy too,"
36375,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As makes the very darkness there
36376,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,More beautiful than light elsewhere.
36377,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36378,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Such is the maid who at this hour
36379,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Hath risen from her restless sleep
36380,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And sits alone in that high bower,"
36381,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Watching the still and shining deep.
36382,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Ah! 'twas not thus,--with tearful eyes"
36383,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And beating heart,--she used to gaze"
36384,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"On the magnificent earth and skies,"
36385,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"In her own land, in happier days."
36386,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Why looks she now so anxious down
36387,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Among those rocks whose rugged frown
36388,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Blackens the mirror of the deep?
36389,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Whom waits she all this lonely night?
36390,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Too rough the rocks, too bold the steep,"
36391,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,For man to scale that turret's height!--
36392,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36393,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"So deemed at least her thoughtful sire,"
36394,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"When high, to catch the cool night-air"
36395,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"After the day-beam's withering fire,[205]"
36396,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"He built her bower of freshness there,"
36397,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And had it deckt with costliest skill
36398,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And fondly thought it safe as fair:--
36399,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Think, reverend dreamer! think so still,"
36400,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Nor wake to learn what Love can dare;--
36401,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Love, all defying Love, who sees"
36402,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,No charm in trophies won with ease;--
36403,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Whose rarest, dearest fruits of bliss"
36404,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Are plucked on Danger's precipice!
36405,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Bolder than they who dare not dive
36406,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"For pearls but when the sea's at rest,"
36407,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Love, in the tempest most alive,"
36408,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Hath ever held that pearl the best
36409,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,He finds beneath the stormiest water.
36410,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Yes, ARABY'S unrivalled daughter,"
36411,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Tho' high that tower, that rock-way rude,"
36412,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,There's one who but to kiss thy cheek

36719,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,beautiful porcelain[214] which now supplied the use of mirrors to the
36720,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,young maidens as they adjusted their hair in descending from the
36721,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,palankeens. Here while as usual the Princess sat listening anxiously with
36722,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,FADLADEEN in one of his loftiest moods of criticism by her side the young
36723,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Poet leaning against a branch of the tree thus continued his story:--
36724,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36725,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36726,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The morn hath risen clear and calm
36727,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And o'er the Green Sea[215] palely shines,"
36728,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Revealing BAHREIN'S groves of palm
36729,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And lighting KISHMA'S amber vines.
36730,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Fresh smell the shores of ARABY,"
36731,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,While breezes from the Indian sea
36732,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Blow round SELAMA'S[216] sainted cape
36733,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And curl the shining flood beneath,--"
36734,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Whose waves are rich with many a grape
36735,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And cocoa-nut and flowery wreath
36736,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Which pious seamen as they past
36737,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Had toward that holy headland cast--
36738,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Oblations to the Genii there
36739,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,For gentle skies and breezes fair!
36740,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The nightingale now bends her flight[217]
36741,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,From the high trees where all the night
36742,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,She sung so sweet with none to listen;
36743,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And hides her from the morning star
36744,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Where thickets of pomegranate glisten
36745,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"In the clear dawn,--bespangled o'er"
36746,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With dew whose night-drops would not stain
36747,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The best and brightest scimitar[218]
36748,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That ever youthful Sultan wore
36749,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,On the first morning of his reign.
36750,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36751,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And see--the Sun himself!--on wings
36752,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of glory up the East he springs.
36753,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Angel of Light! who from the time
36754,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Those heavens began their march sublime,"
36755,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Hath first of all the starry choir
36756,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Trod in his Maker's steps of fire!
36757,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Where are the days, thou wondrous sphere,"
36758,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"When IRAN, like a sun-flower, turned"
36759,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To meet that eye where'er it burned?--
36760,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When from the banks of BENDEMEER
36761,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To the nut-groves of SAMARCAND
36762,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Thy temples flamed o'er all the land?
36763,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Where are they? ask the shades of them
36764,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Who, on CADESSIA'S[219] bloody plains,"
36765,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Saw fierce invaders pluck the gem
36766,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"From IRAN'S broken diadem,"
36767,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And bind her ancient faith in chains:--
36768,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Ask the poor exile cast alone
36769,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"On foreign shores, unloved, unknown,"
36770,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Beyond the Caspian's Iron Gates,"
36771,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Or on the snowy Mossian mountains,"
36772,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Far from his beauteous land of dates,"
36773,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Her jasmine bowers and sunny fountains:
36774,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Yet happier so than if he trod
36775,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,His own beloved but blighted sod
36776,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Beneath a despot stranger's nod!--
36777,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Oh, he would rather houseless roam"
36778,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Where Freedom and his God may lead,"
36779,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Than be the sleekest slave at home
36780,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That crouches to the conqueror's creed!
36781,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36782,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Is IRAN'S pride then gone for ever,"
36783,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Quenched with the flame in MITHRA'S caves?
36784,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,No--she has sons that never--never--
36785,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Will stoop to be the Moslem's slaves
36786,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,While heaven has light or earth has graves;--
36787,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Spirits of fire that brood not long
36788,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But flash resentment back for wrong;
36789,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And hearts where, slow but deep, the seeds"
36790,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of vengeance ripen into deeds,"
36791,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Till in some treacherous hour of calm
36792,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,They burst like ZEILAN'S giant palm[220]
36793,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Whose buds fly open with a sound
36794,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That shakes the pigmy forests round!
36795,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Yes, EMIR! he, who scaled that tower,"
36796,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And had he reached thy slumbering breast
36797,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Had taught thee in a Gheber's power
36798,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,How safe even tyrant heads may rest--
36799,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Is one of many, brave as he,"
36800,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Who loathe thy haughty race and thee;
36801,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Who tho' they knew the strife is vain,"
36802,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Who tho' they know the riven chain
36803,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Snaps but to enter in the heart
36804,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of him who rends its links apart,"
36805,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Yet dare the issue,--blest to be"
36806,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Even for one bleeding moment free
36807,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And die in pangs of liberty!
36808,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Thou knowest them well--'tis some moons since
36809,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Thy turbaned troops and blood-red flags,"
36810,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Thou satrap of a bigot Prince,"
36811,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Have swarmed among these Green Sea crags;
36812,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Yet here, even here, a sacred band"
36813,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Ay, in the portal of that land"
36814,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Thou, Arab, darest to call thy own,"
36815,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Their spears across thy path have thrown;
36816,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Here--ere the winds half winged thee o'er--
36817,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Rebellion braved thee from the shore.
36818,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36819,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Rebellion! foul, dishonoring word,"
36820,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Whose wrongful blight so oft has stained
36821,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The holiest cause that tongue or sword
36822,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of mortal ever lost or gained.
36823,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,How many a spirit born to bless
36824,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Hath sunk beneath that withering name,"
36825,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Whom but a day's, an hour's success"
36826,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Had wafted to eternal fame!
36827,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As exhalations when they burst
36828,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"From the warm earth if chilled at first,"
36829,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,If checkt in soaring from the plain
36830,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Darken to fogs and sink again;--
36831,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But if they once triumphant spread
36832,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Their wings above the mountain-head,"
36833,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Become enthroned in upper air,"
36834,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And turn to sun-bright glories there!
36835,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36836,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And who is he that wields the might
36837,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of Freedom on the Green Sea brink,"
36838,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Before whose sabre's dazzling light[221]
36839,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The eyes of YEMEN'S warriors wink?
36840,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Who comes embowered in the spears
36841,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of KERMAN'S hardy mountaineers?
36842,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Those mountaineers that truest, last,"
36843,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Cling to their country's ancient rites,"
36844,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As if that God whose eyelids cast
36845,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Their closing gleam on IRAN'S heights,"
36846,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Among her snowy mountains threw
36847,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The last light of his worship too!
36848,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"'Tis HAFED--name of fear, whose sound"
36849,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Chills like the muttering of a charm!--
36850,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Shout but that awful name around,"
36851,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And palsy shakes the manliest arm.
36852,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36853,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"'Tis HAFED, most accurst and dire"
36854,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,(So rankt by Moslem hate and ire)
36855,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of all the rebel Sons of Fire;
36856,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of whose malign, tremendous power"
36857,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The Arabs at their mid-watch hour
36858,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Such tales of fearful wonder tell
36859,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That each affrighted sentinel
36860,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Pulls down his cowl upon his eyes,"
36861,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Lest HAFED in the midst should rise!
36862,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"A man, they say, of monstrous birth,"
36863,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"A mingled race of flame and earth,"
36864,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Sprung from those old, enchanted kings[222]"
36865,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Who in their fairy helms of yore
36866,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A feather from the mystic wings
36867,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of the Simoorgh resistless wore;
36868,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And gifted by the Fiends of Fire,"
36869,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Who groaned to see their shrines expire
36870,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With charms that all in vain withstood
36871,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Would drown the Koran's light in blood!
36872,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36873,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Such were the tales that won belief,"
36874,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And such the coloring Fancy gave
36875,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"To a young, warm, and dauntless Chief,--"
36876,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"One who, no more than mortal brave,"
36877,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Fought for the land his soul adored,"
36878,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"For happy homes and altars free,--"
36879,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"His only talisman, the sword,"
36880,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"His only spell-word, Liberty!"
36881,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"One of that ancient hero line,"
36882,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Along whose glorious current shine
36883,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Names that have sanctified their blood:
36884,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As LEBANON'S small mountain-flood
36885,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Is rendered holy by the ranks
36886,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of sainted cedars on its banks.[223]
36887,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,'Twas not for him to crouch the knee
36888,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Tamely to Moslem tyranny;
36889,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,'Twas not for him whose soul was cast
36890,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"In the bright mould of ages past,"
36891,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Whose melancholy spirit fed
36892,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With all the glories of the dead
36893,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Tho' framed for IRAN'S happiest years.
36894,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Was born among her chains and tears!--
36895,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,'Twas not for him to swell the crowd
36896,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of slavish heads, that shrinking bowed"
36897,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Before the Moslem as he past
36898,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Like shrubs beneath the poison-blast--
36899,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,No--far he fled--indignant fled
36900,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The pageant of his country's shame;
36901,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,While every tear her children shed
36902,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Fell on his soul like drops of flame;
36903,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And as a lover hails the dawn
36904,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of a first smile, so welcomed he"
36905,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The sparkle of the first sword drawn
36906,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,For vengeance and for liberty!
36907,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But vain was valor--vain the flower
36908,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of KERMAN, in that deathful hour,"
36909,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Against AL HASSAN'S whelming power.--
36910,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In vain they met him helm to helm
36911,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Upon the threshold of that realm
36912,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"He came in bigot pomp to sway,"
36913,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And with their corpses blockt his way--
36914,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In vain--for every lance they raised
36915,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Thousands around the conqueror blazed;
36916,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,For every arm that lined their shore
36917,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Myriads of slaves were wafted o'er,--"
36918,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"A bloody, bold, and countless crowd,"
36919,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Before whose swarm as fast they bowed
36920,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As dates beneath the locust cloud.
36921,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36922,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,There stood--but one short league away
36923,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,From old HARMOZIA'S sultry bay--
36924,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A rocky mountain o'er the Sea--
36925,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of OMAN beetling awfully;[224]
36926,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A last and solitary link
36927,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of those stupendous chains that reach
36928,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,From the broad Caspian's reedy brink
36929,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Down winding to the Green Sea beach.
36930,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Around its base the bare rocks stood
36931,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Like naked giants, in the flood"
36932,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As if to guard the Gulf across;
36933,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,While on its peak that braved the sky
36934,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A ruined Temple towered so high
36935,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That oft the sleeping albatross[225]
36936,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Struck the wild ruins with her wing,"
36937,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And from her cloud-rockt slumbering
36938,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Started--to find man's dwelling there
36939,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In her own silent fields of air!
36940,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Beneath, terrific caverns gave"
36941,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Dark welcome to each stormy wave
36942,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That dasht like midnight revellers in;--
36943,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And such the strange, mysterious din"
36944,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"At times throughout those caverns rolled,--"
36945,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And such the fearful wonders told
36946,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of restless sprites imprisoned there,"
36947,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That bold were Moslem who would dare
36948,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,At twilight hour to steer his skiff
36949,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Beneath the Gheber's lonely cliff.[226]
36950,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"On the land side those towers sublime,"
36951,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That seemed above the grasp of Time,"
36952,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Were severed from the haunts of men
36953,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"By a wide, deep, and wizard glen,"
36954,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"So fathomless, so full of gloom,"
36955,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,No eye could pierce the void between:
36956,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,It seemed a place where Ghouls might come
36957,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With their foul banquets from the tomb
36958,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And in its caverns feed unseen.
36959,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Like distant thunder, from below"
36960,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The sound of many torrents came,"
36961,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Too deep for eye or ear to know
36962,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"If 'twere the sea's imprisoned flow,"
36963,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Or floods of ever-restless flame.
36964,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"For each ravine, each rocky spire"
36965,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of that vast mountain stood on fire;[227]
36966,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And tho' for ever past the days
36967,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When God was worshipt in the blaze--
36968,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That from its lofty altar shone,--"
36969,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Tho' fled the priests, the votaries gone,"
36970,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Still did the mighty flame burn on,[228]"
36971,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Thro' chance and change, thro' good and ill,"
36972,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Like its own God's eternal will,"
36973,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Deep, constant, bright, unquenchable!"
36974,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
36975,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Thither the vanquisht HAFED led

36994,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And gloomily the fitful flame
36995,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That from the ruined altar broke
36996,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Glared on his features as he spoke:--
36997,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""'Tis o'er--what men could do, we've done--"

37036,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,His Chiefs stood round--each shining blade
37037,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Upon the broken altar laid--
37038,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And tho' so wild and desolate
37039,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Those courts where once the Mighty sate:
37040,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Nor longer on those mouldering towers
37041,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Was seen the feast of fruits and flowers
37042,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With which of old the Magi fed
37043,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The wandering Spirits of their Dead;[231]
37044,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Tho' neither priest nor rites were there,"

37050,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"They swore the latest, holiest deed"
37051,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of the few hearts, still left to bleed,"
37052,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Should be in IRAN'S injured name
37053,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To die upon that Mount of Flame--
37054,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The last of all her patriot line,"

37057,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Brave, suffering souls! they little knew"
37058,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,How many a tear their injuries drew
37059,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"From one meek maid, one gentle foe,"

37061,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Whose life, as free from thought as sin,"
37062,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Slept like a lake till Love threw in
37063,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,His talisman and woke the tide
37064,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And spread its trembling circles wide.
37065,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Once, EMIR! thy unheeding child"

37071,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Light-hearted maid, unawed, unmoved,"
37072,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"While Heaven but spared the sire she loved,"
37073,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Once at thy evening tales of blood
37074,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Unlistening and aloof she stood--
37075,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And oft when thou hast paced along
37076,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Thy Haram halls with furious heat,"
37077,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Hast thou not curst her cheerful song,"
37078,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That came across thee, calm and sweet,"

37081,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37082,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Far other feelings Love hath brought--

37092,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,There's not a sabre meets her eye
37093,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But with his life-blood seems to swim;
37094,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,There's not an arrow wings the sky
37095,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But fancy turns its point to him.
37096,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,No more she brings with footsteps light
37097,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,AL HASSAN's falchion for the fight;
37098,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And--had he lookt with clearer sight,"
37099,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Had not the mists that ever rise
37100,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,From a foul spirit dimmed his eyes--
37101,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"He would have markt her shuddering frame,"
37102,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"When from the field of blood he came,"
37103,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The faltering speech--the look estranged--

37106,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Such change is wrought by Love alone!
37107,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Ah! not the Love that should have blest
37108,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"So young, so innocent a breast;"
37109,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Not the pure, open, prosperous Love,"
37110,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That, pledged on earth and sealed above,"
37111,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Grows in the world's approving eyes,"
37112,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"In friendship's smile and home's caress,"
37113,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Collecting all the heart's sweet ties
37114,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Into one knot of happiness!
37115,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"No, HINDA, no,--thy fatal flame"
37116,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Is nurst in silence, sorrow, shame;--"
37117,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"A passion without hope or pleasure,"
37118,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"In thy soul's darkness buried deep,"
37119,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"It lies like some ill-gotten treasure,--"
37120,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Some idol without shrine or name,"
37121,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,O'er which its pale-eyed votaries keep
37122,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Unholy watch while others sleep.

37124,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Seven nights have darkened OMAN'S sea,"
37125,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Since last beneath the moonlight ray

37127,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Hurry her Gheber's bark away,--"
37128,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And still she goes at midnight hour
37129,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To weep alone in that high bower
37130,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And watch and look along the deep
37131,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,For him whose smiles first made her weep;--
37132,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"But watching, weeping, all was vain,"
37133,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,She never saw his bark again.
37134,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The owlet's solitary cry,"

37240,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37241,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37242,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,LALLA ROOKH had the night before been visited by a dream which in spite of
37243,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,the impending fate of poor HAFED made her heart more than usually cheerful
37244,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,during the morning and gave her cheeks all the freshened animation of a
37245,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,flower that the Bidmusk had just passed over.[240] She fancied that she
37246,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,was sailing on that Eastern Ocean where the sea-gypsies who live for ever
37247,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,on the water[241] enjoy a perpetual summer in wandering from isle to isle
37248,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,when she saw a small gilded bark approaching her. It was like one of those
37249,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"boats which the Maldivian islanders send adrift, at the mercy of winds and"
37250,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"waves, loaded with perfumes, flowers, and odoriferous wood, as an offering"
37251,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"to the Spirit whom they call King of the Sea. At first, this little bark"
37252,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,appeared to be empty but on coming nearer--
37253,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37254,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"She had proceeded thus far in relating the dream to her Ladies, when"
37255,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,FERAMORZ appeared at the door of the pavilion. In his presence of course
37256,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,everything else was forgotten and the continuance of the story was
37257,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,instantly requested by all. Fresh wood of aloes was set to burn in the
37258,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"cassolets;--the violet sherbets[242] were hastily handed round, and after"
37259,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"a short prelude on his lute in the pathetic measure of Nava,[243] which is"
37260,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"always used to express the lamentations of absent lovers, the Poet thus"
37261,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,continued:--
37262,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37263,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37264,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The day is lowering--stilly black
37265,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Sleeps the grim wave, while heaven's rack,"
37266,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Disperst and wild, 'twixt earth and sky"
37267,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Hangs like a shattered canopy.
37268,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,There's not a cloud in that blue plain
37269,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But tells of storm to come or past;--
37270,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Here flying loosely as the mane
37271,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of a young war-horse in the blast;--
37272,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"There rolled in masses dark and swelling,"
37273,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As proud to be the thunder's dwelling!
37274,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,While some already burst and riven
37275,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Seen melting down the verge of heaven;
37276,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As tho' the infant storm had rent
37277,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The mighty womb that gave him birth,"
37278,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And having swept the firmament
37279,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Was now in fierce career for earth.
37280,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37281,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"On earth 'twas yet all calm around,"
37282,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"A pulseless silence, dread, profound,"
37283,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,More awful than the tempest's sound.
37284,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The diver steered for ORMUS' bowers,"
37285,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And moored his skiff till calmer hours;
37286,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The sea-birds with portentous screech
37287,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Flew fast to land;--upon the beach
37288,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The pilot oft had paused, with glance"
37289,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Turned upward to that wild expanse;--
37290,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And all was boding, drear and dark"
37291,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As her own soul when HINDA'S bark
37292,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Went slowly from the Persian shore.--
37293,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"No music timed her parting oar,[244]"
37294,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Nor friends upon the lessening strand
37295,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Lingering to wave the unseen hand
37296,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Or speak the farewell, heard no more;--"
37297,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"But lone, unheeded, from the bay"
37298,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The vessel takes its mournful way,"
37299,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Like some ill-destined bark that steers
37300,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In silence thro' the Gate of Tears.[245]
37301,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And where was stern AL HASSAN then?
37302,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Could not that saintly scourge of men
37303,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,From bloodshed and devotion spare
37304,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,One minute for a farewell there?
37305,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,No--close within in changeful fits
37306,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of cursing and of prayer he sits
37307,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In savage loneliness to brood
37308,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Upon the coming night of blood,--"
37309,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"With that keen, second-scent of death,"
37310,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,By which the vulture snuffs his food
37311,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In the still warm and living breath![246]
37312,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,While o'er the wave his weeping daughter
37313,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Is wafted from these scenes of slaughter,--"
37314,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"As a young bird of BABYLON,[247]"
37315,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Let loose to tell of victory won,"
37316,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Flies home, with wing, ah! not unstained"
37317,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,By the red hands that held her chained.
37318,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37319,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And does the long-left home she seeks
37320,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Light up no gladness on her cheeks?
37321,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The flowers she nurst--the well-known groves,"
37322,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Where oft in dreams her spirit roves--
37323,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Once more to see her dear gazelles
37324,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Come bounding with their silver bells;
37325,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Her birds' new plumage to behold
37326,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And the gay, gleaming fishes count,"
37327,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,She left all filleted with gold
37328,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Shooting around their jasper fount;[248]
37329,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Her little garden mosque to see,"
37330,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And once again, at evening hour,"
37331,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To tell her ruby rosary
37332,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In her own sweet acacia bower.--
37333,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Can these delights that wait her now
37334,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Call up no sunshine on her brow?
37335,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"No,--silent, from her train apart,--"
37336,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As if even now she felt at heart
37337,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The chill of her approaching doom,--"
37338,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"She sits, all lovely in her gloom"
37339,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As a pale Angel of the Grave;
37340,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And o'er the wide, tempestuous wave"
37341,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Looks with a shudder to those towers
37342,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Where in a few short awful hours
37343,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Blood, blood, in streaming tides shall run,"
37344,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Foul incense for to-morrow's sun!
37345,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Where art thou, glorious stranger! thou,"
37346,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""So loved, so lost, where art thou now?"
37347,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Foe--Gheber--infidel--whate'er"
37348,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""The unhallowed name thou'rt doomed to bear,"
37349,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Still glorious--still to this fond heart"
37350,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Dear as its blood, whate'er thou art!"

37355,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Forgetting faith--home--father--all"
37356,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Before its earthly idol fall,"

37359,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Thy Paradise itself were dim"
37360,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""And joyless, if not shared with him!"""
37361,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Her hands were claspt--her eyes upturned,"
37362,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Dropping their tears like moonlight rain;
37363,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And, tho' her lip, fond raver! burned"
37364,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"With words of passion, bold, profane."
37365,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Yet was there light around her brow,"
37366,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"A holiness in those dark eyes,"
37367,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Which showed,--tho' wandering earthward now,--"
37368,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Her spirit's home was in the skies.
37369,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Yes--for a spirit pure as hers
37370,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Is always pure, even while it errs;"
37371,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As sunshine broken in the rill
37372,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Tho' turned astray is sunshine still!
37373,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37374,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,So wholly had her mind forgot
37375,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,All thoughts but one she heeded not
37376,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The rising storm--the wave that cast
37377,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A moment's midnight as it past--
37378,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Nor heard the frequent shout, the tread"
37379,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of gathering tumult o'er her head--
37380,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Clasht swords and tongues that seemed to vie
37381,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With the rude riot of the sky.--
37382,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"But, hark!--that war-whoop on the deck--"
37383,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That crash as if each engine there,"
37384,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Mast, sails and all, were gone to wreck,"
37385,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Mid yells and stampings of despair!
37386,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Merciful Heaven! what _can_ it be?
37387,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"'Tis not the storm, tho' fearfully"
37388,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The ship has shuddered as she rode
37389,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"O'er mountain-waves--""Forgive me, God!"
37390,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Forgive me""--shrieked the maid and knelt,"
37391,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Trembling all over--for she felt
37392,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As if her judgment hour was near;
37393,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"While crouching round half dead with fear,"
37394,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Her handmaids clung, nor breathed nor stirred--"
37395,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"When, hark!--a second crash--a third--"
37396,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And now as if a bolt of thunder
37397,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Had riven the laboring planks asunder,"
37398,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The deck falls in--what horrors then!
37399,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Blood, waves and tackle, swords and men"
37400,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Come mixt together thro' the chasm,--"
37401,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Some wretches in their dying spasm
37402,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Still fighting on--and some that call
37403,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""For GOD and IRAN!"" as they fall!"
37404,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Whose was the hand that turned away
37405,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The perils of the infuriate fray,"
37406,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And snatcht her breathless from beneath
37407,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,This wilderment of wreck and death?
37408,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,She knew not--for a faintness came
37409,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Chill o'er her and her sinking frame
37410,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Amid the ruins of that hour
37411,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Lay like a pale and scorched flower
37412,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Beneath the red volcano's shower.
37413,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"But, oh! the sights and sounds of dread"
37414,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That shockt her ere her senses fled!
37415,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The yawning deck--the crowd that strove
37416,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Upon the tottering planks above--
37417,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The sail whose fragments, shivering o'er"
37418,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The stragglers' heads all dasht with gore
37419,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Fluttered like bloody flags--the clash
37420,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of sabres and the lightning's flash
37421,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Upon their blades, high tost about"
37422,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Like meteor brands[249]--as if throughout
37423,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The elements one fury ran,"
37424,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,One general rage that left a doubt
37425,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Which was the fiercer, Heaven or Man!"
37426,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Once too--but no--it could not be--
37427,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"'Twas fancy all--yet once she thought,"
37428,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,While yet her fading eyes could see
37429,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,High on the ruined deck she caught
37430,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"A glimpse of that unearthly form,"
37431,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That glory of her soul,--even then,"
37432,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Amid the whirl of wreck and storm,"
37433,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Shining above his fellow-men,"
37434,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As on some black and troublous night
37435,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The Star of EGYPT,[250] whose proud light"
37436,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Never hath beamed on those who rest
37437,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"In the White Islands of the West,"
37438,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Burns thro' the storm with looks of flame
37439,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That put Heaven's cloudier eyes to shame.
37440,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But no--'twas but the minute's dream--
37441,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A fantasy--and ere the scream
37442,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Had half-way past her pallid lips,"
37443,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"A death-like swoon, a chill eclipse"
37444,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of soul and sense its darkness spread
37445,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Around her and she sunk as dead.
37446,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"How calm, how beautiful comes on"
37447,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The stilly hour when storms are gone,"
37448,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"When warring winds have died away,"
37449,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And clouds beneath the glancing ray
37450,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Melt off and leave the land and sea
37451,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Sleeping in bright tranquillity,--"
37452,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Fresh as if Day again were born,"
37453,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Again upon the lap of Morn!--
37454,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When the light blossoms rudely torn
37455,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And scattered at the whirlwind's will,"
37456,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Hang floating in the pure air still,"
37457,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Filling it all with precious balm,"
37458,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In gratitude for this sweet calm;--
37459,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And every drop the thundershowers
37460,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Have left upon the grass and flowers
37461,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Sparkles, as 'twere that lightning-gem[251]"
37462,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Whose liquid flame is born of them!
37463,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"When, 'stead of one unchanging breeze,"
37464,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,There blow a thousand gentle airs
37465,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And each a different perfume bears,--"
37466,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As if the loveliest plants and trees
37467,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Had vassal breezes of their own
37468,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"To watch and wait on them alone,"
37469,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And waft no other breath than theirs:
37470,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"When the blue waters rise and fall,"
37471,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In sleepy sunshine mantling all;
37472,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And even that swell the tempest leaves
37473,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Is like the full and silent heaves
37474,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of lovers' hearts when newly blest,"
37475,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Too newly to be quite at rest.
37476,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37477,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Such was the golden hour that broke
37478,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Upon the world when HINDA woke
37479,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,From her long trance and heard around
37480,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,No motion but the water's sound
37481,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Rippling against the vessel's side,"
37482,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As slow it mounted o'er the tide.--
37483,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"But where is she?--her eyes are dark,"
37484,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Are wilder still--is this the bark,"
37485,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The same, that from HARMOZIA'S bay"
37486,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Bore her at morn--whose bloody way
37487,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The sea-dog trackt?--no--strange and new
37488,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Is all that meets her wondering view.
37489,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Upon a galliot's deck she lies,"
37490,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Beneath no rich pavilion's shade,--"
37491,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"No plumes to fan her sleeping eyes,"
37492,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Nor jasmine on her pillow laid.
37493,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But the rude litter roughly spread
37494,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"With war-cloaks is her homely bed,"
37495,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And shawl and sash on javelins hung
37496,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,For awning o'er her head are flung.
37497,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Shuddering she lookt around--there lay
37498,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"A group of warriors in the sun,"
37499,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Resting their limbs, as for that day"
37500,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Their ministry of death were done.
37501,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Some gazing on the drowsy sea
37502,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Lost in unconscious revery;
37503,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And some who seemed but ill to brook
37504,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That sluggish calm with many a look
37505,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"To the slack sail impatient cast,"
37506,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As loose it bagged around the mast.
37507,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37508,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Blest ALLA! who shall save her now?
37509,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,There's not in all that warrior band
37510,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"One Arab sword, one turbaned brow"
37511,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,From her own Faithful Moslem land.
37512,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Their garb--the leathern belt that wraps
37513,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Each yellow vest[252]--that rebel hue--
37514,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The Tartar fleece upon their caps[253]--
37515,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Yes--yes--her fears are all too true,"
37516,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And Heaven hath in this dreadful hour
37517,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Abandoned her to HAFED'S power;--
37518,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"HAFED, the Gheber!--at the thought"
37519,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Her very heart's blood chills within;
37520,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,He whom her soul was hourly taught
37521,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"To loathe as some foul fiend of sin,"
37522,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Some minister whom Hell had sent
37523,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To spread its blast where'er he went
37524,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And fling as o'er our earth he trod
37525,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,His shadow betwixt man and God!
37526,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And she is now his captive,--thrown"
37527,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"In his fierce hands, alive, alone;"
37528,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"His the infuriate band she sees,"
37529,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,All infidels--all enemies!
37530,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,What was the daring hope that then
37531,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Crost her like lightning, as again"
37532,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With boldness that despair had lent
37533,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,She darted tho' that armed crowd
37534,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"A look so searching, so intent,"
37535,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That even the sternest warrior bowed
37536,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Abasht, when he her glances caught,"
37537,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As if he guessed whose form they sought.
37538,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"But no--she sees him not--'tis gone,"
37539,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The vision that before her shone
37540,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Thro' all the maze of blood and storm,"
37541,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Is fled--'twas but a phantom form--
37542,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"One of those passing, rainbow dreams,"
37543,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Half light, half shade, which Fancy's beams"
37544,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Paint on the fleeting mists that roll
37545,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In trance or slumber round the soul.
37546,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37547,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But now the bark with livelier bound
37548,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Scales the blue wave--the crew's in motion.
37549,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The oars are out and with light sound
37550,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Break the bright mirror of the ocean,"
37551,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Scattering its brilliant fragments round.
37552,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And now she sees--with horror sees,"
37553,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Their course is toward that mountain-hold,--"
37554,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Those towers that make her life-blood freeze,"
37555,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Where MECCA'S godless enemies
37556,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Lie like beleaguered scorpions rolled
37557,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"In their last deadly, venomous fold!"
37558,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Amid the illumined land and flood
37559,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Sunless that mighty mountain stood;
37560,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Save where above its awful head,"
37561,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"There shone a flaming cloud, blood-red,"
37562,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As 'twere the flag of destiny
37563,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Hung out to mark where death would be!
37564,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37565,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Had her bewildered mind the power
37566,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of thought in this terrific hour,"
37567,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,She well might marvel where or how
37568,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Man's foot could scale that mountain's brow,"
37569,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Since ne'er had Arab heard or known
37570,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of path but thro' the glen alone.--
37571,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"But every thought was lost in fear,"
37572,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"When, as their bounding bark drew near"
37573,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The craggy base, she felt the waves"
37574,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Hurry them toward those dismal caves
37575,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That from the Deep in windings pass
37576,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Beneath that Mount's volcanic mass;--
37577,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And loud a voice on deck commands
37578,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To lower the mast and light the brands!--
37579,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Instantly o'er the dashing tide
37580,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Within a cavern's mouth they glide,"
37581,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Gloomy as that eternal Porch
37582,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Thro' which departed spirits go:--
37583,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Not even the flare of brand and torch
37584,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Its flickering light could further throw
37585,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Than the thick flood that boiled below.
37586,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Silent they floated--as if each
37587,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Sat breathless, and too awed for speech"
37588,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In that dark chasm where even sound
37589,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Seemed dark,--so sullenly around"
37590,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The goblin echoes of the cave
37591,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Muttered it o'er the long black wave
37592,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As 'twere some secret of the grave!
37593,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37594,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But soft--they pause--the current turns
37595,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Beneath them from its onward track;--
37596,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Some mighty, unseen barrier spurns"
37597,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The vexed tide all foaming back,"
37598,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And scarce the oar's redoubled force
37599,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Can stem the eddy's whirling course;
37600,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"When, hark!--some desperate foot has sprung"
37601,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Among the rocks--the chain is flung--
37602,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The oars are up--the grapple clings,"
37603,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And the tost bark in moorings swings.
37604,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Just then, a day-beam thro' the shade"
37605,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Broke tremulous--but ere the maid
37606,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Can see from whence the brightness steals,"
37607,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Upon her brow she shuddering feels
37608,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A viewless hand that promptly ties
37609,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A bandage round her burning eyes;
37610,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"While the rude litter where she lies,"
37611,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Uplifted by the warrior throng,"
37612,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,O'er the steep rocks is borne along.
37613,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37614,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Blest power of sunshine!--genial Day,"
37615,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"What balm, what life is in thy ray!"
37616,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"To feel thee is such real bliss,"
37617,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That had the world no joy but this
37618,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To sit in sunshine calm and sweet.--
37619,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,It were a world too exquisite
37620,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"For man to leave it for the gloom,"
37621,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The deep, cold shadow of the tomb."
37622,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Even HINDA, tho' she saw not where"
37623,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Or whither wound the perilous road,"
37624,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Yet knew by that awakening air,"
37625,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Which suddenly around her glowed,"
37626,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That they had risen from the darkness there,"
37627,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And breathed the sunny world again!
37628,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37629,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But soon this balmy freshness fled--
37630,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,For now the steepy labyrinth led
37631,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Thro' damp and gloom--mid crash of boughs,"
37632,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And fall of loosened crags that rouse
37633,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The leopard from his hungry sleep,"
37634,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Who starting thinks each crag a prey,"
37635,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And long is heard from steep to steep
37636,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Chasing them down their thundering way!
37637,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The jackal's cry--the distant moan
37638,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of the hyena, fierce and lone--"
37639,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And that eternal saddening sound
37640,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of torrents in the glen beneath,"
37641,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As 'twere the ever-dark Profound
37642,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That rolls beneath the Bridge of Death!
37643,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"All, all is fearful--even to see,"
37644,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To gaze on those terrific things
37645,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"She now but blindly hears, would be"
37646,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Relief to her imaginings;
37647,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Since never yet was shape so dread,"
37648,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But Fancy thus in darkness thrown
37649,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And by such sounds of horror fed
37650,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Could frame more dreadful of her own.
37651,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37652,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But does she dream? has Fear again
37653,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Perplext the workings of her brain,"
37654,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Or did a voice, all music, then"
37655,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Come from the gloom, low whispering near--"
37656,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Tremble not, love, thy Gheber's here?"""
37657,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"She _does_ not dream--all sense, all ear,"
37658,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"She drinks the words, ""Thy Gheber's here."""
37659,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,'Twas his own voice--she could not err--
37660,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Throughout the breathing world's extent
37661,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"There was but _one_ such voice for her,"

37724,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The next evening LALLA ROOKH was entreated by her Ladies to continue the
37725,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,relation of her wonderful dream; but the fearful interest that hung round
37726,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,the fate of HINDA and her lover had completely removed every trace of it
37727,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,from her mind;--much to the disappointment of a fair seer or two in her
37728,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"train, who prided themselves on their skill in interpreting visions, and"
37729,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"who had already remarked, as an unlucky omen, that the Princess, on the"
37730,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"very morning after the dream, had worn a silk dyed with the blossoms of"
37731,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"the sorrowful tree, Nilica.[255]"
37732,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37733,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"FADLADEEN, whose indignation had more than once broken out during the"
37734,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"recital of some parts of this heterodox poem, seemed at length to have"
37735,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,made up his mind to the infliction; and took his seat this evening with
37736,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,all the patience of a martyr while the Poet resumed his profane and
37737,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,seditious story as follows:--
37738,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37739,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37740,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To tearless eyes and hearts at ease
37741,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The leafy shores and sun-bright seas
37742,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That lay beneath that mountain's height
37743,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Had been a fair enchanting sight.
37744,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,'Twas one of those ambrosial eyes
37745,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A day of storm so often leaves
37746,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,At its calm setting--when the West
37747,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Opens her golden bowers of rest,"
37748,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And a moist radiance from the skies
37749,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Shoots trembling down, as from the eyes"
37750,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of some meek penitent whose last
37751,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Bright hours atone for dark ones past,"
37752,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And whose sweet tears o'er wrong forgiven
37753,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Shine as they fall with light from heaven!
37754,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37755,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,'Twas stillness all--the winds that late
37756,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Had rushed through KERMAN'S almond groves,"
37757,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And shaken from her bowers of date
37758,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That cooling feast the traveller loves.[256]
37759,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Now lulled to languor scarcely curl
37760,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The Green Sea wave whose waters gleam
37761,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Limpid as if her mines of pearl
37762,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Were melted all to form the stream:
37763,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And her fair islets small and bright
37764,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With their green shores reflected there
37765,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Look like those PERI isles of light
37766,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That hang by spell-work in the air
37767,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37768,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But vainly did those glories burst
37769,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"On HINDA'S dazzled eyes, when first"
37770,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The bandage from her brow was taken,"
37771,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And, pale and awed as those who waken"
37772,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"In their dark tombs--when, scowling near,"
37773,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The Searchers of the Grave[257] appear.--
37774,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,She shuddering turned to read her fate
37775,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In the fierce eyes that flasht around;
37776,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And saw those towers all desolate,"
37777,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That o'er her head terrific frowned,"
37778,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As if defying even the smile
37779,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of that soft heaven to gild their pile.
37780,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"In vain with mingled hope and fear,"
37781,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,She looks for him whose voice so dear
37782,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Had come, like music, to her ear,--"
37783,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Strange, mocking dream! again 'tis fled."
37784,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And oh, the shoots, the pangs of dread"
37785,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That thro' her inmost bosom run,"
37786,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When voices from without proclaim
37787,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""HAFED, the Chief""--and, one by one,"
37788,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The warriors shout that fearful name!
37789,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,He comes--the rock resounds his tread--
37790,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,How shall she dare to lift her head
37791,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Or meet those eyes whose scorching glare
37792,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Not YEMEN'S boldest sons can bear?
37793,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"In whose red beam, the Moslem tells,"
37794,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Such rank and deadly lustre dwells
37795,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As in those hellish fires that light
37796,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The mandrake's charnel leaves at night.[258]
37797,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"How shall she bear that voice's tone,"
37798,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,At whose loud battle-cry alone
37799,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Whole squadrons oft in panic ran,"
37800,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Scattered like some vast caravan,"
37801,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When stretched at evening round the well
37802,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,They hear the thirsting tiger's yell.
37803,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37804,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Breathless she stands with eyes cast down
37805,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Shrinking beneath the fiery frown
37806,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Which, fancy tells her, from that brow"
37807,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Is flashing o'er her fiercely now:
37808,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And shuddering as she hears the tread
37809,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of his retiring warrior band.--
37810,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Never was pause full of dread;
37811,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Till HAFED with a trembling hand
37812,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Took hers and leaning o'er her said,"
37813,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""HINDA;""--that word was all he spoke."
37814,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And 'twas enough--the shriek that broke
37815,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,From her full bosom told the rest.--
37816,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Panting with terror, joy, surprise,"
37817,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The maid but lifts her wandering eyes,"
37818,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To hide them on her Gheber's breast!
37819,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"'Tis he, 'tis he--the man of blood,"
37820,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The fellest of the Fire-fiend's brood,"
37821,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"HAFED, the demon of the fight,"
37822,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Whose voice unnerves, whose glances blight,--"
37823,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Is her own loved Gheber, mild"
37824,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And glorious as when first he smiled
37825,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In her lone tower and left such beams
37826,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of his pure eye to light her dreams,"
37827,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That she believed her bower had given
37828,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Rest to some wanderer from heaven!
37829,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37830,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Moments there are, and this was one,"
37831,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Snatched like a minute's gleam of sun
37832,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Amid the black Simoom's eclipse--
37833,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Or like those verdant spots that bloom
37834,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Around the crater's burning lips.
37835,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Sweetening the very edge of doom!
37836,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The past, the future--all that Fate"
37837,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Can bring of dark or desperate
37838,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Around such hours but makes them cast
37839,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Intenser radiance while they last!
37840,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Even he, this youth--tho' dimmed and gone"
37841,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Each Star of Hope that cheered him on--
37842,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,His glories lost--his cause betrayed--
37843,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"IRAN, his dear-loved country, made"
37844,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"A land of carcasses and slaves,"
37845,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,One dreary waste of chains and graves!
37846,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Himself but lingering, dead at heart,"
37847,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"To see the last, long struggling breath"
37848,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of Liberty's great soul depart,"
37849,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Then lay him down and share her death--
37850,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Even he so sunk in wretchedness
37851,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"With doom still darker gathering o'er him,"
37852,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Yet, in this moment's pure caress,"
37853,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"In the mild eyes that shone before him,"
37854,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Beaming that blest assurance worth
37855,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,All other transports known on earth.
37856,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That he was loved-well, warmly loved--"
37857,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Oh! in this precious hour he proved
37858,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"How deep, how thorough-felt the glow"
37859,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of rapture kindling out of woe;--
37860,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,How exquisite one single drop
37861,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of bliss thus sparkling to the top
37862,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of misery's cup--how keenly quaft,"
37863,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Tho' death must follow on the draught!
37864,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37865,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,She too while gazing on those eyes
37866,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That sink into her soul so deep,"
37867,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Forgets all fears, all miseries,"
37868,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Or feels them like the wretch in sleep,"
37869,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Whom fancy cheats into a smile.
37870,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Who dreams of joy and sobs the while!
37871,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The mighty Ruins where they stood
37872,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Upon the mount's high, rocky verge"
37873,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Lay open towards the ocean flood,"
37874,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Where lightly o'er the illumined surge
37875,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Many a fair bark that, all the day,"
37876,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Had lurkt in sheltering creek or bay
37877,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Now bounded on and gave their sails,"
37878,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Yet dripping to the evening gales;
37879,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Like eagles when the storm is done,"
37880,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Spreading their wet wings in the sun.
37881,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The beauteous clouds, tho' daylight's Star"
37882,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Had sunk behind the hills of LAR,"
37883,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Were still with lingering glories bright.--
37884,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As if to grace the gorgeous West
37885,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The Spirit of departing Light
37886,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That eve had left his sunny vest
37887,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Behind him ere he winged his flight.
37888,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Never was scene so formed for love!
37889,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Beneath them waves of crystal move
37890,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In silent swell--Heaven glows above
37891,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And their pure hearts, to transport given,"
37892,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Swell like the wave and glow like heaven.
37893,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37894,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But ah! too soon that dream is past--
37895,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Again, again her fear returns;--"
37896,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Night, dreadful night, is gathering fast,"
37897,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"More faintly the horizon burns,"
37898,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And every rosy tint that lay
37899,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,On the smooth sea hath died away
37900,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Hastily to the darkening skies
37901,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A glance she casts--then wildly cries

37907,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Sounding from yonder fearful glen?--"
37908,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Perhaps, even now they climb the wood--"
37909,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Fly, fly--tho' still the West is bright,"
37910,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""He'll come--oh! yes--he wants thy blood--"

37912,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
37913,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In terrors even to agony
37914,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,She clings around the wondering Chief;--
37915,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Alas, poor wildered maid! to me"
37916,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Thou owest this raving trance of grief."
37917,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Lost as I am, naught ever grew"

37925,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""When casting but a single glance"
37926,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Upon thy pale and prostrate charms,"
37927,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""I vowed (tho' watching viewless o'er"

37977,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of her best, happiest, grandest days."
37978,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Never in moment most elate
37979,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Did that high spirit loftier rise:--
37980,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"While bright, serene, determinate,"
37981,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"His looks are lifted to the skies,"
37982,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As if the signal lights of Fate
37983,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Were shining in those awful eyes!
37984,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,'Tis come--his hour of martyrdom
37985,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In IRAN'S sacred cause is come;
37986,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And tho' his life hath past away
37987,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Like lightning on a stormy day,"
37988,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Yet shall his death-hour leave a track
37989,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of glory permanent and bright
37990,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"To which the brave of after-times,"
37991,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The suffering brave, shall long look back"
37992,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"With proud regret,--and by its light"
37993,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Watch thro' the hours of slavery's night
37994,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,For vengeance on the oppressor's crimes.
37995,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"This rock, his monument aloft,"
37996,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Shall speak the tale to many an age;
37997,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And hither bards and heroes oft
37998,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Shall come in secret pilgrimage,"
37999,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And bring their warrior sons and tell
38000,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The wondering boys where HAFED fell;
38001,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And swear them on those lone remains
38002,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of their lost country's ancient fanes,"
38003,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Never--while breath of life shall live
38004,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Within them--never to forgive
38005,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The accursed race whose ruthless chain
38006,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Hath left on IRAN'S neck a stain
38007,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Blood, blood alone can cleanse again!"
38008,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38009,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Such are the swelling thoughts that now
38010,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Enthrone themselves on HAFED'S brow;
38011,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And ne'er did Saint of ISSA [260] gaze
38012,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,On the red wreath for martyrs twined.
38013,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,More proudly than the youth surveys
38014,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That pile which thro' the gloom behind,"
38015,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Half lighted by the altar's fire,"
38016,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Glimmers--his destined funeral pyre!
38017,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Heaped by his own, his comrades hands,"
38018,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of every wood of odorous breath.
38019,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"There, by the Fire-God's shrine it stands,"
38020,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Ready to fold in radiant death
38021,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The few still left of those who swore
38022,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To perish there when hope was o'er--
38023,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The few to whom that couch of flame,"
38024,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Which rescues them from bonds and shame,"
38025,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Is sweet and welcome as the bed
38026,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"For their own infant Prophet spread,"
38027,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When pitying Heaven to roses turned
38028,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The death-flames that beneath him burned![261]
38029,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38030,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With watchfulness the maid attends
38031,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,His rapid glance where'er it bends--
38032,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Why shoot his eyes such awful beams?
38033,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,What plans he now? what thinks or dreams?
38034,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Alas! why stands he musing here,"
38035,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When every moment teems with fear?
38036,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""HAFED, my own beloved Lord,"""
38037,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"She kneeling cries--""first, last adored!"
38038,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""If in that soul thou'st ever felt"
38039,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Half what thy lips impassioned swore,"
38040,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Here on my knees that never knelt"
38041,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""To any but their God before,"
38042,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""I pray thee, as thou lovest me, fly--"
38043,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Now, now--ere yet their blades are nigh."
38044,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Oh haste--the bark that bore me hither"
38045,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Can waft us o'er yon darkening sea"
38046,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""East--west--alas, I care not whither,"
38047,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""So thou art safe, and I with thee!"
38048,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Go where we will, this hand in thine,"
38049,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Those eyes before me smiling thus,"
38050,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Thro' good and ill, thro' storm and shine,"
38051,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""The world's a world of love for us!"
38052,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""On some calm, blessed shore we'll dwell,"
38053,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Where 'tis no crime to love too well;"
38054,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Where thus to worship tenderly"
38055,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""An erring child of light like thee"
38056,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Will not be sin--or if it be"
38057,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Where we may weep our faults away,"
38058,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Together kneeling, night and day,"
38059,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Thou, for _my_ sake, at ALLA'S shrine,"
38060,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""And I--at _any_ God's, for thine!"""
38061,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38062,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Wildly these passionate words she spoke--
38063,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Then hung her head and wept for shame;
38064,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Sobbing as if a heart-string broke
38065,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"With every deep-heaved sob that came,"
38066,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"While he, young, warm--oh! wonder not"
38067,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"If, for a moment, pride and fame;"
38068,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"His oath--his cause--that shrine of flame,"
38069,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And IRAN'S self are all forgot
38070,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"For her, whom at his feet he sees"
38071,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Kneeling in speechless agonies.
38072,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"No, blame him not if Hope awhile"
38073,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Dawned in his soul and threw her smile
38074,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"O'er hours to come--o'er days and nights,"
38075,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Winged with those precious, pure delights"
38076,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Which she who bends all beauteous there
38077,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Was born to kindle and to share.
38078,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A tear or two which as he bowed
38079,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"To raise the suppliant, trembling stole,"
38080,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,First warned him of this dangerous cloud
38081,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of softness passing o'er his soul.
38082,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Starting he brusht the drops away
38083,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Unworthy o'er that cheek to stray;--
38084,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Like one who on the morn of fight
38085,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Shakes from his sword the dews of night,"
38086,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That had but dimmed not stained its light.
38087,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38088,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Yet tho' subdued the unnerving thrill,"
38089,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Its warmth, its weakness lingered still"
38090,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"So touching in each look and tone,"
38091,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That the fond, fearing, hoping maid"
38092,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Half counted on the flight she prayed,"
38093,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Half thought the hero's soul was grown
38094,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"As soft, as yielding as her own,"
38095,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And smiled and blest him while he said,--"
38096,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Yes--if there be some happier sphere"
38097,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Where fadeless truth like ours is dear.--"
38098,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""If there be any land of rest"
38099,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""For those who love and ne'er forget,"
38100,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Oh! comfort thee--for safe and blest"
38101,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""We'll meet in that calm region yet!"""
38102,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38103,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Scarce had she time to ask her heart
38104,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"If good or ill these words impart,"
38105,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When the roused youth impatient flew
38106,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"To the tower-wall, where high in view"
38107,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"A ponderous sea-horn[262] hung, and blew"
38108,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A signal deep and dread as those
38109,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The storm-fiend at his rising blows.--
38110,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Full well his Chieftains, sworn and true"
38111,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Thro' life and death, that signal knew;"
38112,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"For 'twas the appointed warning-blast,"
38113,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The alarm to tell when hope was past
38114,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And the tremendous death-die cast!
38115,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And there upon the mouldering tower
38116,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Hath hung this sea-horn many an hour,"
38117,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Ready to sound o'er land and sea
38118,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That dirge-note of the brave and free.
38119,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38120,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,They came--his Chieftains at the call
38121,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Came slowly round and with them all--
38122,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Alas, how few!--the worn remains"
38123,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of those who late o'er KERMAN'S plains
38124,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When gayly prancing to the clash
38125,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of Moorish zel and tymbalon
38126,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Catching new hope from every flash
38127,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of their long lances in the sun,"
38128,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And as their coursers charged the wind
38129,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And the white ox-tails streamed behind,[263]"
38130,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Looking as if the steeds they rode
38131,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Were winged and every Chief a God!
38132,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"How fallen, how altered now! how wan"
38133,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Each scarred and faded visage shone,"
38134,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As round the burning shrine they came;--
38135,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"How deadly was the glare it cast,"
38136,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As mute they paused before the flame
38137,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To light their torches as they past!
38138,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,'Twas silence all--the youth hath planned
38139,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The duties of his soldier-band;
38140,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And each determined brow declares
38141,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,His faithful Chieftains well know theirs.
38142,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But minutes speed--night gems the skies--
38143,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And oh, how soon, ye blessed eyes"
38144,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That look from heaven ye may behold
38145,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Sights that will turn your star-fires cold!
38146,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Breathless with awe, impatience, hope,"
38147,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The maiden sees the veteran group
38148,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Her litter silently prepare,"
38149,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And lay it at her trembling feet;--
38150,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And now the youth with gentle care,"
38151,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Hath placed her in the sheltered seat
38152,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And prest her hand--that lingering press
38153,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of hands that for the last time sever;
38154,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of hearts whose pulse of happiness
38155,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When that hold breaks is dead for ever.
38156,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And yet to _her_ this sad caress
38157,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Gives hope--so fondly hope can err!
38158,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"'Twas joy, she thought, joy's mute excess--"
38159,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Their happy flight's dear harbinger;
38160,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,'Twas warmth--assurance--tenderness--
38161,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,'Twas any thing but leaving her.
38162,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38163,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Haste, haste!"" she cried, ""the clouds grow dark,"
38164,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""But still, ere night, we'll reach the bark;"
38165,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""And by to-morrow's dawn--oh bliss!"
38166,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""With thee upon the sun-bright deep,"
38167,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Far off, I'll but remember this,"
38168,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""As some dark vanisht dream of sleep;"
38169,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""And thou""--but ah!--he answers not--"
38170,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Good Heaven!--and does she go alone?
38171,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"She now has reached that dismal spot,"
38172,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Where some hours since his voice's tone
38173,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Had come to soothe her fears and ills,"
38174,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Sweet as the angel ISRAFIL'S,[264]"
38175,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When every leaf on Eden's tree
38176,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Is trembling to his minstrelsy--
38177,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Yet now--oh, now, he is not nigh.--"
38178,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""HAFED! my HAFED!--if it be"
38179,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Thy will, thy doom this night to die"
38180,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Let me but stay to die with thee"
38181,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""And I will bless thy loved name,"
38182,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Till the last life-breath leave this frame."
38183,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Oh! let our lips, our cheeks be laid"
38184,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""But near each other while they fade;"
38185,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Let us but mix our parting breaths,"
38186,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""And I can die ten thousand deaths!"
38187,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""You too, who hurry me away"
38188,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""So cruelly, one moment stay--"
38189,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Oh! stay--one moment is not much--"
38190,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""He yet may come--for _him_ I pray--"
38191,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""HAFED! dear HAFED!""--all the way"
38192,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In wild lamentings that would touch
38193,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A heart of stone she shrieked his name
38194,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To the dark woods--no HAFED came:--
38195,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,No--hapless pair--you've lookt your last:--
38196,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Your hearts should both have broken then:--
38197,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The dream is o'er--your doom is cast--
38198,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,You'll never meet on earth again!
38199,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38200,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Alas for him who hears her cries!
38201,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Still half-way down the steep he stands,"
38202,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Watching with fixt and feverish eyes
38203,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The glimmer of those burning brands
38204,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That down the rocks with mournful ray,"
38205,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Light all he loves on earth away!
38206,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Hopeless as they who far at sea
38207,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,By the cold moon have just consigned
38208,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The corse of one loved tenderly
38209,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"To the bleak flood they leave behind,"
38210,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And on the deck still lingering stay,"
38211,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And long look back with sad delay
38212,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To watch the moonlight on the wave
38213,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That ripples o'er that cheerless grave.
38214,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38215,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But see--he starts--what heard he then?
38216,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That dreadful shout!--across the glen
38217,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,From the land-side it comes and loud
38218,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Rings thro' the chasm, as if the crowd"
38219,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of fearful things that haunt that dell
38220,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Its Ghouls and Divs and shapes of hell,"
38221,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And all in one dread howl broke out,"
38222,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"So loud, so terrible that shout!"
38223,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""They come--the Moslems come!""--he cries,"
38224,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"His proud soul mounting to his eyes,--"
38225,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Now, Spirits of the Brave, who roam"
38226,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Enfranchised thro' yon starry dome,"
38227,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Rejoice--for souls of kindred fire"
38228,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Are on the wing to join your choir!"""
38229,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"He said--and, light as bridegrooms bound"
38230,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"To their young loves, reclined the steep"
38231,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And gained the Shrine--his Chiefs stood round--
38232,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Their swords, as with instinctive leap,"
38233,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Together at that cry accurst
38234,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Had from their sheaths like sunbeams burst.
38235,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And hark!--again--again it rings;
38236,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Near and more near its echoings
38237,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Peal thro' the chasm--oh! who that then
38238,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Had seen those listening warrior-men,"
38239,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"With their swords graspt, their eyes of flame"
38240,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Turned on their Chief--could doubt the shame,"
38241,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The indignant shame with which they thrill
38242,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To hear those shouts and yet stand still?
38243,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38244,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,He read their thoughts--they were his own--
38245,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""What! while our arms can wield these blades,"
38246,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Shall we die tamely? die alone?"
38247,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Without one victim to our shades,"
38248,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""One Moslem heart, where buried deep"
38249,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""The sabre from its toil may sleep?"
38250,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""No--God of IRAN'S burning skies!"
38251,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Thou scornest the inglorious sacrifice."
38252,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""No--tho' of all earth's hope bereft,"
38253,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Life, swords, and vengeance still are left."
38254,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""We'll make yon valley's reeking caves"
38255,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Live in the awe-struck minds of men"
38256,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Till tyrants shudder, when their slaves"
38257,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Tell of the Gheber's bloody glen,"
38258,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Follow, brave hearts!--this pile remains"
38259,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Our refuge still from life and chains;"
38260,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""But his the best, the holiest bed,"
38261,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Who sinks entombed in Moslem dead!"""
38262,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38263,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Down the precipitous rocks they sprung,"
38264,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,While vigor more than human strung
38265,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Each arm and heart.--The exulting foe
38266,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Still thro' the dark defiles below,"
38267,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Trackt by his torches' lurid fire,"
38268,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Wound slow, as thro' GOLCONDA'S vale"
38269,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The mighty serpent in his ire
38270,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Glides on with glittering, deadly trail."
38271,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,No torch the Ghebers need--so well
38272,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"They know each mystery of the dell,"
38273,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,So oft have in their wanderings
38274,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Crost the wild race that round them dwell,"
38275,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The very tigers from their delves
38276,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Look out and let them pass as things
38277,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Untamed and fearless like themselves!
38278,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38279,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,There was a deep ravine that lay
38280,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Yet darkling in the Moslem's way;
38281,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Fit spot to make invaders rue
38282,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The many fallen before the few.
38283,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The torrents from that morning's sky
38284,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Had filled the narrow chasm breast-high,"
38285,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And on each side aloft and wild
38286,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Huge cliffs and toppling crags were piled,--"
38287,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The guards with which young Freedom lines
38288,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The pathways to her mountain-shrines,"
38289,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Here at this pass the scanty band;
38290,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of IRAN'S last avengers stand;
38291,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Here wait in silence like the dead
38292,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And listen for the Moslem's tread
38293,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,So anxiously the carrion-bird
38294,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Above them flaps his wing unheard!
38295,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38296,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,They come--that plunge into the water
38297,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Gives signal for the work of slaughter.
38298,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Now, Ghebers, now--if e'er your blades"
38299,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Had point or prowess prove them now--
38300,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Woe to the file that foremost wades!
38301,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"They come--a falchion greets each brow,"
38302,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And as they tumble trunk on trunk
38303,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Beneath the gory waters sunk,"
38304,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Still o'er their drowning bodies press
38305,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,New victims quick and numberless;
38306,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Till scarce an arm in HAFED'S band,"
38307,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"So fierce their toil, hath power to stir,"
38308,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But listless from each crimson hand
38309,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The sword hangs clogged with massacre.
38310,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Never was horde of tyrants met
38311,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With bloodier welcome--never yet
38312,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To patriot vengeance hath the sword
38313,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,More terrible libations poured!
38314,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38315,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"All up the dreary, long ravine,"
38316,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"By the red, murky glimmer seen"
38317,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of half-quenched brands, that o'er the flood"
38318,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Lie scattered round and burn in blood,"
38319,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,What ruin glares! what carnage swims!
38320,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Heads, blazing turbans, quivering limbs,"
38321,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Lost swords that dropt from many a hand,"
38322,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In that thick pool of slaughter stand;--
38323,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Wretches who wading, half on fire"
38324,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"From the tost brands that round them fly,"
38325,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,'Twixt flood and flame in shrieks expire;--
38326,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And some who grasp by those that die
38327,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Sink woundless with them, smothered o'er"
38328,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In their dead brethren's gushing gore!
38329,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38330,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"But vainly hundreds, thousands bleed,"
38331,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Still hundreds, thousands more succeed;"
38332,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Countless as toward some flame at night
38333,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The North's dark insects wing their flight
38334,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And quench or perish in its light,"
38335,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To this terrific spot they pour--
38336,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Till, bridged with Moslem bodies o'er,"
38337,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"It bears aloft their slippery tread,"
38338,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And o'er the dying and the dead,"
38339,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Tremendous causeway! on they pass.
38340,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Then, hapless Ghebers, then, alas,"
38341,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"What hope was left for you? for you,"
38342,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Whose yet warm pile of sacrifice
38343,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Is smoking in their vengeful eyes;--
38344,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Whose swords how keen, how fierce they knew."
38345,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And burned with shame to find how few.
38346,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38347,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Crusht down by that vast multitude
38348,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Some found their graves where first they stood;
38349,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"While some with hardier struggle died,"
38350,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And still fought on by HAFED'S side,"
38351,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Who fronting to the foe trod back
38352,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Towards the high towers his gory track;
38353,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And as a lion swept away
38354,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,By sudden swell of JORDAN'S pride
38355,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"From the wild covert where he lay,[265]"
38356,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Long battles with the o'erwhelming tide,"
38357,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,So fought he back with fierce delay
38358,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And kept both foes and fate at bay.
38359,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38360,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"But whither now? their track is lost,"
38361,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Their prey escaped--guide, torches gone--"
38362,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"By torrent-beds and labyrinths crost,"
38363,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The scattered crowd rush blindly on--
38364,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Curse on those tardy lights that wind,"""
38365,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"They panting cry, ""so far behind;"
38366,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Oh, for a bloodhound's precious scent,"
38367,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""To track the way the Ghebers went!"""
38368,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Vain wish--confusedly along
38369,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,They rush more desperate as more wrong:
38370,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Till wildered by the far-off lights,"
38371,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Yet glittering up those gloomy heights,"
38372,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Their footing mazed and lost they miss,"
38373,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And down the darkling precipice
38374,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Are dasht into the deep abyss;
38375,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Or midway hang impaled on rocks,"
38376,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A banquet yet alive for flocks
38377,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of ravening vultures,--while the dell"
38378,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Re-echoes with each horrible yell.
38379,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Those sounds--the last, to vengeance dear."
38380,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That e'er shall ring in HAFED'S ear,--"
38381,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Now reached him as aloft alone
38382,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Upon the steep way breathless thrown,"
38383,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"He lay beside his reeking blade,"
38384,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Resigned, as if life's task were o'er,"
38385,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Its last blood-offering amply paid,"
38386,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And IRAN'S self could claim no more.
38387,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"One only thought, one lingering beam"
38388,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Now broke across his dizzy dream
38389,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of pain and weariness--'twas she,"
38390,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,His heart's pure planet shining yet
38391,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Above the waste of memory
38392,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When all life's other lights were set.
38393,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And never to his mind before
38394,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Her image such enchantment wore.
38395,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"It seemed as if each thought that stained,"
38396,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Each fear that chilled their loves was past,"
38397,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And not one cloud of earth remained
38398,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Between him and her radiance cast;--
38399,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"As if to charms, before so bright,"
38400,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,New grace from other worlds was given.
38401,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And his soul saw her by the light
38402,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Now breaking o'er itself from heaven!
38403,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38404,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,A voice spoke near him--'twas the tone
38405,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of a loved friend, the only one"
38406,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of all his warriors left with life
38407,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,From that short night's tremendous strife.--
38408,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""And must we then, my chief, die here?"
38409,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Foes round us and the Shrine so near!"""
38410,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,These words have roused the last remains
38411,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of life within him:--""What! not yet"
38412,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Beyond the reach of Moslem chains!"""
38413,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38414,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The thought could make even Death forget
38415,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,His icy bondage:--with a bound
38416,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,He springs all bleeding from the ground
38417,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And grasps his comrade's arm now grown
38418,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Even feebler, heavier than his own."
38419,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And up the painful pathway leads,"
38420,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Death gaining on each step he treads.
38421,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Speed them, thou God, who heardest their vow!"
38422,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,They mount--they bleed--oh save them now--
38423,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The crags are red they've clambered o'er,"
38424,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The rock-weed's dripping with their gore;--
38425,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Thy blade too, HAFED, false at length,"
38426,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,How breaks beneath thy tottering strength!
38427,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Haste, haste--the voices of the Foe"
38428,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Come near and nearer from below--
38429,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"One effort more--thank Heaven! 'tis past,"
38430,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,They've gained the topmost steep at last.
38431,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And now they touch the temple's walls.
38432,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Now HAFED sees the Fire divine--
38433,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"When, lo!--his weak, worn comrade falls"
38434,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Dead on the threshold of the shrine.
38435,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Alas, brave soul, too quickly fled!"
38436,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""And must I leave thee withering here,"
38437,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""The sport of every ruffian's tread,"
38438,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""The mark for every coward's spear?"
38439,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""No, by yon altar's sacred beams!"""
38440,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,He cries and with a strength that seems
38441,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Not of this world uplifts the frame
38442,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of the fallen Chief and toward the flame
38443,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Bears him along; with death-damp hand
38444,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The corpse upon the pyre he lays,"
38445,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Then lights the consecrated brand
38446,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And fires the pile whose sudden blaze
38447,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Like lightning bursts o'er OMAN'S Sea.--
38448,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""Now, Freedom's God! I come to Thee,"""
38449,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The youth exclaims and with a smile
38450,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of triumph vaulting on the pile,"
38451,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In that last effort ere the fires
38452,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Have harmed one glorious limb expires!
38453,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38454,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,What shriek was that on OMAN'S tide?
38455,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"It came from yonder drifting bark,"
38456,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That just hath caught upon her side
38457,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The death-light--and again is dark.
38458,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,It is the boat--ah! why delayed?--
38459,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That bears the wretched Moslem maid;
38460,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Confided to the watchful care
38461,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of a small veteran band with whom
38462,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Their generous Chieftain would not share
38463,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"The secret of his final doom,"
38464,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But hoped when HINDA safe and free
38465,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Was rendered to her father's eyes,"
38466,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Their pardon full and prompt would be
38467,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The ransom of so dear a prize.--
38468,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Unconscious thus of HAFED'S fate,"
38469,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And proud to guard their beauteous freight,"
38470,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Scarce had they cleared the surfy waves
38471,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That foam around those frightful caves
38472,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When the curst war-whoops known so well
38473,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Came echoing from the distant dell--
38474,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Sudden each oar, upheld and still,"
38475,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Hung dripping o'er the vessel's side,"
38476,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And driving at the current's will,"
38477,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,They rockt along the whispering tide;
38478,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,While every eye in mute dismay
38479,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Was toward that fatal mountain turned.
38480,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Where the dim altar's quivering ray
38481,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,As yet all lone and tranquil burned.
38482,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38483,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Oh! 'tis not, HINDA, in the power"
38484,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of Fancy's most terrific touch
38485,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,To paint thy pangs in that dread hour--
38486,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Thy silent agony--'twas such
38487,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"As those who feel could paint too well,"
38488,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But none e'er felt and lived to tell!
38489,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,'Twas not alone the dreary state
38490,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Of a lorn spirit crusht by fate,"
38491,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,When tho' no more remains to dread
38492,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The panic chill will not depart;--
38493,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"When tho' the inmate Hope be dead,"
38494,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Her ghost still haunts the mouldering heart;
38495,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"No--pleasures, hopes, affections gone,"
38496,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The wretch may bear and yet live on
38497,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Like things within the cold rock found
38498,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Alive when all's congealed around.
38499,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"But there's a blank repose in this,"
38500,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"A calm stagnation, that were bliss"
38501,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"To the keen, burning, harrowing pain,"
38502,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Now felt thro' all thy breast and brain;--
38503,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That spasm of terror, mute, intense,"
38504,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"That breathless, agonized suspense"
38505,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"From whose hot throb whose deadly aching,"
38506,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The heart hath no relief but breaking!
38507,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38508,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Calm is the wave--heaven's brilliant lights
38509,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Reflected dance beneath the prow;--
38510,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Time was when on such lovely nights
38511,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,She who is there so desolate now
38512,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Could sit all cheerful tho' alone
38513,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And ask no happier joy than seeing
38514,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That starlight o'er the waters thrown--
38515,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"No joy but that to make her blest,"
38516,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And the fresh, buoyant sense of Being"
38517,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Which bounds in youth's yet careless breast,--"
38518,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Itself a star not borrowing light
38519,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But in its own glad essence bright.
38520,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"How different now!--but, hark! again"
38521,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The yell of havoc rings--brave men!
38522,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In vain with beating hearts ye stand
38523,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,On the bark's edge--in vain each hand
38524,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Half draws the falchion from its sheath;
38525,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,All's o'er--in rust your blades may lie:--
38526,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,He at whose word they've scattered death
38527,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Even now this night himself must die!
38528,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Well may ye look to yon dim tower,"
38529,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And ask and wondering guess what means
38530,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The battle-cry at this dead hour--
38531,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Ah! she could tell you--she who leans
38532,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Unheeded there, pale, sunk, aghast,"
38533,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With brow against the dew-cold mast;--
38534,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Too well she knows--her more than life,"
38535,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Her soul's first idol and its last
38536,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Lies bleeding in that murderous strife.
38537,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But see--what moves upon the height?
38538,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Some signal!--'tis a torch's light
38539,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,What bodes its solitary glare?
38540,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,In gasping silence toward the Shrine
38541,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"All eyes are turned--thine, HINDA, thine"
38542,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Fix their last fading life-beams there.
38543,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,'Twas but a moment--fierce and high
38544,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The death-pile blazed into the sky
38545,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And far-away o'er rock and flood
38546,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Its melancholy radiance sent:
38547,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,While HAFED like a vision stood
38548,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Revealed before the burning pyre.
38549,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Tall, shadowy, like a Spirit of fire"
38550,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Shrined in its own grand element!
38551,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"""'Tis he!""--the shuddering maid exclaims,--"
38552,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But while she speaks he's seen no more;
38553,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"High burst in air the funeral flames,"
38554,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And IRAN'S hopes and hers are o'er!
38555,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38556,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"One wild, heart-broken shriek she gave;"
38557,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Then sprung as if to reach that blaze
38558,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Where still she fixt her dying gaze,"
38559,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And gazing sunk into the wave.--
38560,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Deep, deep,--where never care or pain"
38561,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Shall reach her innocent heart again!
38562,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38563,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,*       *       *       *       *
38564,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38565,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Farewell--farewell to thee. ARABY'S daughter!
38566,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"(Thus warbled a PERI beneath the dark sea,)"
38567,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,No pearl ever lay under OMAN'S green water
38568,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,More pure in its shell than thy Spirit in thee.
38569,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38570,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Oh! fair as the sea-flower close to thee growing,"
38571,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"How light was thy heart till Love's witchery came,"
38572,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Like the wind of the south[266] o'er a summer lute blowing,"
38573,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And husht all its music and withered its frame!
38574,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38575,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,But long upon ARABY'S green sunny highlands
38576,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Shall maids and their lovers remember the doom
38577,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Of her who lies sleeping among the Pearl Islands
38578,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With naught but the sea-star[267] to light up her tomb.
38579,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38580,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And still when the merry date-season is burning
38581,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"And calls to the palm-groves the young and the old,"
38582,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The happiest there from their pastime returning
38583,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,At sunset will weep when thy story is told.
38584,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38585,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The young village-maid when with flowers she dresses
38586,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Her dark flowing hair for some festival day
38587,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Will think of thy fate till neglecting her tresses
38588,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,She mournfully turns from the mirror away.
38589,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38590,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Nor shall IRAN, beloved of her Hero! forget thee--"
38591,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Tho' tyrants watch over her tears as they start,"
38592,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Close, close by the side of that Hero she'll set thee,"
38593,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Embalmed in the innermost shrine of her heart.
38594,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38595,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Farewell--be it ours to embellish thy pillow
38596,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With everything beauteous that grows in the deep;
38597,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Each flower of the rock and each gem of the billow
38598,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Shall sweeten thy bed and illumine thy sleep.
38599,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38600,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Around thee shall glisten the loveliest amber
38601,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,That ever the sorrowing sea-bird has wept;[268]
38602,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,With many a shell in whose hollow-wreathed chamber
38603,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,We Peris of Ocean by moonlight have slept.
38604,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38605,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,We'll dive where the gardens of coral lie darkling
38606,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And plant all the rosiest stems at thy head;
38607,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,We'll seek where the sands of the Caspian[269] are sparkling
38608,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,And gather their gold to strew over thy bed.
38609,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38610,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Farewell--farewell!--Until Pity's sweet fountain
38611,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Is lost in the hearts of the fair and the brave,"
38612,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"They'll weep for the Chieftain who died on that mountain,"
38613,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,They'll weep for the Maiden who sleeps in this wave.
38614,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38615,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38616,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The singular placidity with which FADLADEEN had listened during the latter
38617,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,part of this obnoxious story surprised the Princess and FERAMORZ
38618,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,exceedingly; and even inclined towards him the hearts of these
38619,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,unsuspicious young persons who little knew the source of a complacency so
38620,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,marvellous. The truth was he had been organizing for the last few days a
38621,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,most notable plan of persecution against the poet in consequence of some
38622,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"passages that had fallen from him on the second evening of recital,--which"
38623,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,appeared to this worthy Chamberlain to contain language and principles for
38624,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,which nothing short of the summary criticism of the Chabuk[270] would be
38625,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,advisable. It was his intention therefore immediately on their arrival at
38626,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Cashmere to give information to the King of Bucharia of the very dangerous
38627,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,sentiments of his minstrel; and if unfortunately that monarch did not act
38628,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"with suitable vigor on the occasion, (that is, if he did not give the"
38629,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Chabuk to FERAMORZ and a place to FADLADEEN.) there would be an end, he"
38630,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"feared, of all legitimate government in Bucharia. He could not help"
38631,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,however auguring better both for himself and the cause of potentates in
38632,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,general; and it was the pleasure arising from these mingled anticipations
38633,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,that diffused such unusual satisfaction through his features and made his
38634,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,eyes shine out like poppies of the desert over the wide and lifeless
38635,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,wilderness of that countenance.
38636,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38637,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Having decided upon the Poet's chastisement in this manner he thought it
38638,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,but humanity to spare him the minor tortures of criticism. Accordingly
38639,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,when they assembled the following evening in the pavilion and LALLA ROOKH
38640,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,was expecting to see all the beauties of her bard melt away one by one in
38641,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"the acidity of criticism, like pearls in the cup of the Egyptian queen.--"
38642,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,he agreeably disappointed her by merely saying with an ironical smile that
38643,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,the merits of such a poem deserved to be tried at a much higher tribunal;
38644,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,and then suddenly passed off into a panegyric upon all Mussulman
38645,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"sovereigns, more particularly his august and Imperial master, Aurungzebe,"
38646,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"--the wisest and best of the descendants of Timur,--who among other great"
38647,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"things he had done for mankind had given to him, FADLADEEN, the very"
38648,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"profitable posts of Betel-carrier and Taster of Sherbets to the Emperor,"
38649,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Chief Holder of the Girdle of Beautiful Forms,[271] and Grand Nazir or"
38650,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Chamberlain of the Haram.
38651,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38652,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,They were now not far from that Forbidden River[272] beyond which no pure
38653,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Hindoo can pass, and were reposing for a time in the rich valley of Hussun"
38654,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Abdaul, which had always been a favorite resting-place of the Emperors in"
38655,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,their annual migrations to Cashmere. Here often had the Light of the
38656,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Faith, Jehan-Guire, been known to wander with his beloved and beautiful"
38657,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"Nourmahal, and here would LALLA ROOKH have been happy to remain for ever,"
38658,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,giving up the throne of Bucharia and the world for FERAMORZ and love in
38659,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"this sweet, lonely valley. But the time was now fast approaching when she"
38660,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"must see him no longer,--or, what was still worse, behold him with eyes"
38661,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"whose every look belonged to another, and there was a melancholy"
38662,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"preciousness in these last moments, which made her heart cling to them as"
38663,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"it would to life. During the latter part of the journey, indeed, she had"
38664,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,sunk into a deep sadness from which nothing but the presence of the young
38665,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,minstrel could awake her. Like those lamps in tombs which only light up
38666,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"when the air is admitted, it was only at his approach that her eyes became"
38667,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,smiling and animated. But here in this dear valley every moment appeared
38668,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"an age of pleasure; she saw him all day and was therefore all day happy,--"
38669,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"resembling, she often thought, that people of Zinge[273] who attribute"
38670,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,the unfading cheerfulness they enjoy to one genial star that rises nightly
38671,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,over their heads.[274]
38672,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38673,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,The whole party indeed seemed in their liveliest mood during the few days
38674,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,they passed in this delightful solitude. The young attendants of the
38675,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Princess who were here allowed a much freer range than they could safely
38676,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,be indulged with in a less sequestered place ran wild among the gardens
38677,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,and bounded through the meadows lightly as young roes over the aromatic
38678,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"plains of Tibet. While FADLADEEN, in addition to the spiritual comfort"
38679,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,derived by him from a pilgrimage to the tomb of the Saint from whom the
38680,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"valley is named, had also opportunities of indulging in a small way his"
38681,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,taste for victims by putting to death some hundreds of those unfortunate
38682,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"little lizards,[275] which all pious Mussulmans make it a point to kill;--"
38683,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,taking for granted that the manner in which the creature hangs its head
38684,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,is meant as a mimicry of the attitude in which the Faithful say their
38685,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,prayers.
38686,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38687,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,About two miles from Hussun Abdaul were those Royal Gardens which had
38688,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"grown beautiful under the care of so many lovely eyes, and were beautiful"
38689,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"still though those eyes could see them no longer. This place, with its"
38690,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,flowers and its holy silence interrupted only by the dipping of the wings
38691,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"of birds in its marble basins filled with the pure water of those hills,"
38692,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"was to LALLA ROOKH all that her heart could fancy of fragrance, coolness,"
38693,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"and almost heavenly tranquillity. As the Prophet said of Damascus, ""it was"
38694,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"too delicious;""[276]--and here in listening to the sweet voice of"
38695,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"FERAMORZ or reading in his eyes what yet he never dared to tell her, the"
38696,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,most exquisite moments of her whole life were passed. One evening when
38697,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"they had been talking of the Sultana Nourmahal, the Light of the Haram,"
38698,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"[277] who had so often wandered among these flowers, and fed with her own"
38699,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,hands in those marble basins the small shining fishes of which she was so
38700,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"fond,--the youth in order to delay the moment of separation proposed to"
38701,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,recite a short story or rather rhapsody of which this adored Sultana was
38702,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"the heroine. It related, he said, to the reconcilement of a sort of"
38703,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,lovers' quarrel which took place between her and the Emperor during a
38704,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,Feast of Roses at Cashmere; and would remind the Princess of that
38705,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"difference between Haroun-al-Raschid and his fair mistress Marida, which"
38706,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,was so happily made up by the soft strains of the musician Moussali. As
38707,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,the story was chiefly to be told in song and FERAMORZ had unluckily
38708,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"forgotten his own lute in the valley, he borrowed the vina of LALLA"
38709,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,"ROOKH'S little Persian slave, and thus began:--"
38710,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38711,THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS.,
38712,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.
38713,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38714,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38715,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Who has not heard of the Vale of CASHMERE,"
38716,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"With its roses the brightest that earth ever gave,[278]"
38717,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Its temples and grottos and fountains as clear
38718,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As the love-lighted eyes that hang over their wave?
38719,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38720,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Oh! to see it at sunset,--when warm o'er the Lake"
38721,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Its splendor at parting a summer eve throws,"
38722,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Like a bride full of blushes when lingering to take
38723,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,A last look of her mirror at night ere she goes!--
38724,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"When the shrines thro' the foliage are gleaming half shown,"
38725,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And each hallows the hour by some rites of its own.
38726,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Here the music of prayer from a minaret swells,"
38727,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Here the Magian his urn full of perfume is swinging,"
38728,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And here at the altar a zone of sweet bells
38729,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Round the waist of some fair Indian dancer is ringing.[279]
38730,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Or to see it by moonlight when mellowly shines
38731,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The light o'er its palaces, gardens, and shrines,"
38732,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,When the water-falls gleam like a quick fall of stars
38733,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And the nightingale's hymn from the Isle of Chenars
38734,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Is broken by laughs and light echoes of feet
38735,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"From the cool, shining walks where the young people meet.--"
38736,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Or at morn when the magic of daylight awakes
38737,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"A new wonder each minute as slowly it breaks,"
38738,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Hills, cupolas, fountains, called forth every one"
38739,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Out of darkness as if but just born of the Sun.
38740,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,When the Spirit of Fragrance is up with the day
38741,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,From his Haram of night-flowers stealing away;
38742,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And the wind full of wantonness wooes like a lover
38743,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The young aspen-trees,[280]"
38744,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,till they tremble all over.
38745,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"When the East is as warm as the light of first hopes,"
38746,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And day with his banner of radiance unfurled
38747,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Shines in thro' the mountainous portal[281] that opes,"
38748,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Sublime, from that Valley of bliss to the world!"
38749,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38750,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"But never yet by night or day,"
38751,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"In dew of spring or summer's ray,"
38752,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Did the sweet Valley shine so gay
38753,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"As now it shines--all love and light,"
38754,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Visions by day and feasts by night!
38755,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,A happier smile illumes each brow;
38756,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"With quicker spread each heart uncloses,"
38757,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And all is ecstasy--for now
38758,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The Valley holds its Feast of Roses;[282]
38759,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The joyous Time when pleasures pour
38760,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Profusely round and in their shower
38761,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Hearts open like the Season's Rose,--"
38762,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The Floweret of a hundred leaves[283]
38763,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Expanding while the dew-fall flows
38764,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And every leaf its balm receives.
38765,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38766,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,'Twas when the hour of evening came
38767,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Upon the Lake, serene and cool,"
38768,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,When day had hid his sultry flame
38769,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Behind the palms of BARAMOULE,"
38770,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,When maids began to lift their heads.
38771,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Refresht from their embroidered beds
38772,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Where they had slept the sun away,"
38773,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And waked to moonlight and to play.
38774,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,All were abroad:--the busiest hive
38775,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,On BELA'S[284] hills is less alive
38776,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"When saffron-beds are full in flower,"
38777,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Than lookt the Valley in that hour.
38778,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,A thousand restless torches played
38779,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Thro' every grove and island shade;
38780,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,A thousand sparkling lamps were set
38781,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,On every dome and minaret;
38782,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And fields and pathways far and near
38783,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Were lighted by a blaze so clear
38784,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,That you could see in wandering round
38785,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The smallest rose-leaf on the ground,"
38786,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Yet did the maids and matrons leave
38787,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Their veils at home, that brilliant eve;"
38788,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And there were glancing eyes about
38789,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And cheeks that would not dare shine out
38790,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,In open day but thought they might
38791,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Look lovely then, because 'twas night."
38792,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And all were free and wandering
38793,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And all exclaimed to all they met,"
38794,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,That never did the summer bring
38795,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,So gay a Feast of Roses yet;--
38796,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The moon had never shed a light
38797,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,So clear as that which blest them there;
38798,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The roses ne'er shone half so bright,"
38799,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Nor they themselves lookt half so fair.
38800,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38801,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And what a wilderness of flowers!
38802,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,It seemed as tho' from all the bowers
38803,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And fairest fields of all the year,"
38804,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The mingled spoil were scattered here.
38805,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The lake too like a garden breathes
38806,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"With the rich buds that o'er it lie,--"
38807,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As if a shower of fairy wreaths
38808,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Had fallen upon it from the sky!
38809,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And then the sounds of joy,--the beat"
38810,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Of tabors and of dancing feet;--
38811,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The minaret-crier's chant of glee
38812,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Sung from his lighted gallery,[285]"
38813,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And answered by a ziraleet
38814,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"From neighboring Haram, wild and sweet;--"
38815,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The merry laughter echoing
38816,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,From gardens where the silken swing[286]
38817,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Wafts some delighted girl above
38818,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The top leaves of the orange-grove;
38819,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Or from those infant groups at play
38820,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Among the tents[287] that line the way,"
38821,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Flinging, unawed by slave or mother,"
38822,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Handfuls of roses at each other.--
38823,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Then the sounds from the Lake,--the low whispering in boats,"
38824,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"As they shoot thro' the moonlight,--the dipping of oars"
38825,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And the wild, airy warbling that everywhere floats"
38826,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Thro' the groves, round the islands, as if all the shores"
38827,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Like those of KATHAY uttered music and gave
38828,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,An answer in song to the kiss on each wave.[288]
38829,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,But the gentlest of all are those sounds full of feeling
38830,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"That soft from the lute of some lover are stealing,--"
38831,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Some lover who knows all the heart-touching power
38832,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Of a lute and a sigh in this magical hour.
38833,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Oh! best of delights as it everywhere is
38834,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"To be near the loved _One_,--what a rapture is his"
38835,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Who in moonlight and music thus sweetly may glide
38836,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,O'er the Lake of CASHMERE with that _One_ by his side!
38837,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38838,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"If woman can make the worst wilderness dear,"
38839,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Think, think what a Heaven she must make of CASHMERE!"
38840,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38841,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"So felt the magnificent Son of ACBAR,"
38842,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,When from power and pomp and the trophies of war
38843,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,He flew to that Valley forgetting them all
38844,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"With the Light of the HARAM, his young NOURMAHAL."
38845,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,When free and uncrowned as the Conqueror roved
38846,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,By the banks of that Lake with his only beloved
38847,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,He saw in the wreaths she would playfully snatch
38848,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"From the hedges a glory his crown could not match,"
38849,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And preferred in his heart the least ringlet that curled
38850,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Down her exquisite neck to the throne of the world.
38851,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38852,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"There's a beauty for ever unchangingly bright,"
38853,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Like the long, sunny lapse of a summer-day's light,"
38854,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Shining on, shining on, by no shadow made tender"
38855,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Till Love falls asleep in its sameness of splendor.
38856,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"This _was_ not the beauty--oh, nothing like this"
38857,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,That to young NOURMAHAL gave such magic of bliss!
38858,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,But that loveliness ever in motion which plays
38859,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Like the light upon autumn's soft shadowy days,"
38860,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Now here and now there, giving warmth as it flies"
38861,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"From the lip to the cheek, from the cheek to the eyes;"
38862,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Now melting in mist and now breaking in gleams,"
38863,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Like the glimpses a saint hath of Heaven in his dreams.
38864,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"When pensive it seemed as if that very grace,"
38865,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"That charm of all others, was born with her face!"
38866,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And when angry,--for even in the tranquillest climes"
38867,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Light breezes will ruffle the blossoms sometimes--
38868,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The short, passing anger but seemed to awaken"
38869,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,New beauty like flowers that are sweetest when shaken.
38870,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"If tenderness touched her, the dark of her eye"
38871,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"At once took a darker, a heavenlier dye,"
38872,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,From the depth of whose shadow like holy revealings
38873,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,From innermost shrines came the light of her feelings.
38874,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Then her mirth--oh! 'twas sportive as ever took wing
38875,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,From the heart with a burst like the wild-bird in spring;
38876,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Illumed by a wit that would fascinate sages,"
38877,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Yet playful as Peris just loosed from their cages.[289]
38878,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"While her laugh full of life, without any control"
38879,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"But the sweet one of gracefulness, rung from her soul;"
38880,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And where it most sparkled no glance could discover,"
38881,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"In lip, cheek, or eyes, for she brightened all over,--"
38882,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Like any fair lake that the breeze is upon
38883,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"When it breaks into dimples and, laughs in the sun."
38884,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Such, such were the peerless enchantments that gave"
38885,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,NOURMAHAL the proud Lord of the East for her slave:
38886,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And tho' bright was his Haram,--a living parterre"
38887,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Of the flowers[290] of this planet--tho' treasures were there,"
38888,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,For which SOLIMAN'S self might have given all the store
38889,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"That the navy from OPHIR e'er winged to his shore,"
38890,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Yet dim before _her_ were the smiles of them all
38891,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And the Light of his Haram was young NOURMAHAL!
38892,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38893,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"But where is she now, this night of joy,"
38894,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,When bliss is every heart's employ?--
38895,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"When all around her is so bright,"
38896,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"So like the visions of a trance,"
38897,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"That one might think, who came by chance"
38898,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Into the vale this happy night,"
38899,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,He saw that City of Delight[291]
38900,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"In Fairy-land, whose streets and towers"
38901,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Are made of gems and light and flowers!
38902,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Where is the loved Sultana? where,"
38903,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"When mirth brings out the young and fair,"
38904,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Does she, the fairest, hide her brow"
38905,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,In melancholy stillness now?
38906,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38907,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Alas!--how light a cause may move
38908,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Dissension between hearts that love!
38909,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Hearts that the world in vain had tried
38910,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And sorrow but more closely tied;
38911,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,That stood the storm when waves were rough
38912,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Yet in a sunny hour fall off,"
38913,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Like ships that have gone down at sea
38914,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,When heaven was all tranquillity!
38915,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"A something light as air--a look,"
38916,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,A word unkind or wrongly taken--
38917,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Oh! love that tempests never shook,"
38918,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"A breath, a touch like this hath shaken."
38919,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38920,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And ruder words will soon rush in
38921,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To spread the breach that words begin;
38922,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And eyes forget the gentle ray
38923,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,They wore in courtship's smiling day;
38924,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And voices lose the tone that shed
38925,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,A tenderness round all they said;
38926,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Till fast declining one by one
38927,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The sweetnesses of love are gone,"
38928,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And hearts so lately mingled seem
38929,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Like broken clouds,--or like the stream"
38930,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,That smiling left the mountain's brow
38931,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"As tho' its waters ne'er could sever,"
38932,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Yet ere it reach the plain below,"
38933,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Breaks into floods that part for ever.
38934,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38935,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Oh, you that have the charge of Love,"
38936,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Keep him in rosy bondage bound,"
38937,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As in the Fields of Bliss above
38938,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,He sits with flowerets fettered round;--
38939,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Loose not a tie that round him clings.
38940,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Nor ever let him use his wings;
38941,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"For even an hour, a minute's flight"
38942,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Will rob the plumes of half their light.
38943,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Like that celestial bird whose nest
38944,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Is found beneath far Eastern skies,"
38945,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Whose wings tho' radiant when at rest
38946,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Lose all their glory when he flies![292]
38947,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38948,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Some difference of this dangerous kind,--"
38949,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"By which, tho' light, the links that bind"
38950,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The fondest hearts may soon be riven;
38951,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Some shadow in Love's summer heaven,"
38952,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Which, tho' a fleecy speck at first"
38953,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,May yet in awful thunder burst;--
38954,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Such cloud it is that now hangs over
38955,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The heart of the Imperial Lover,"
38956,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And far hath banisht from his sight
38957,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"His NOURMAHAL, his Haram's Light!"
38958,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Hence is it on this happy night
38959,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,When Pleasure thro' the fields and groves
38960,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Has let loose all her world of loves
38961,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And every heart has found its own
38962,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,He wanders joyless and alone
38963,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And weary as that bird of Thrace
38964,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Whose pinion knows no resting place.[293]
38965,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38966,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,In vain the loveliest cheeks and eyes
38967,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,This Eden of the Earth supplies
38968,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Come crowding round--the cheeks are pale,"
38969,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The eyes are dim:--tho' rich the spot
38970,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,With every flower this earth has got
38971,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,What is it to the nightingale
38972,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,If there his darling rose is not?[294]
38973,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,In vain the Valley's smiling throng
38974,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Worship him as he moves along;
38975,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,He heeds them not--one smile of hers
38976,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Is worth a world of worshippers.
38977,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"They but the Star's adorers are,"
38978,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,She is the Heaven that lights the Star!
38979,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
38980,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Hence is it too that NOURMAHAL,"
38981,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Amid the luxuries of this hour,"
38982,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Far from the joyous festival
38983,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Sits in her own sequestered bower,"
38984,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"With no one near to soothe or aid,"
38985,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"But that inspired and wondrous maid,"
38986,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"NAMOUNA, the Enchantress;--one"
38987,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,O'er whom his race the golden sun
38988,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"For unremembered years has run,"
38989,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Yet never saw her blooming brow
38990,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Younger or fairer than 'tis now.
38991,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Nay, rather,--as the west wind's sigh"
38992,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Freshens the flower it passes by,--"
38993,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Time's wing but seemed in stealing o'er
38994,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To leave her lovelier than before.
38995,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Yet on her smiles a sadness hung,"
38996,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And when as oft she spoke or sung
38997,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Of other worlds there came a light
38998,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,From her dark eyes so strangely bright
38999,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,That all believed nor man nor earth
39000,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Were conscious of NAMOUNA'S birth!
39001,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"All spells and talismans she knew,"
39002,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"From the great Mantra,[295] which around"
39003,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The Air's sublimer Spirits drew,"
39004,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"To the gold gems[296] of AFRIC, bound"
39005,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Upon the wandering Arab's arm
39006,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To keep him from the Siltim's[297] harm.
39007,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And she had pledged her powerful art,--"
39008,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Pledged it with all the zeal and heart
39009,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Of one who knew tho' high her sphere,"
39010,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"What 'twas to lose a love so dear,--"
39011,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To find some spell that should recall
39012,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Her Selim's[298] smile to NOURMAHAL!
39013,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39014,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,'Twas midnight--thro' the lattice wreathed
39015,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,With woodbine many a perfume breathed
39016,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,From plants that wake when others sleep.
39017,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,From timid jasmine buds that keep
39018,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Their odor to themselves all day
39019,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,But when the sunlight dies away
39020,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Let the delicious secret out
39021,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To every breeze that roams about;--
39022,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"When thus NAMOUNA:--""'Tis the hour"
39023,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""That scatters spells on herb and flower,"
39024,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""And garlands might be gathered now,"
39025,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""That twined around the sleeper's brow"
39026,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Would make him dream of such delights,"
39027,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Such miracles and dazzling sights"
39028,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""As Genii of the Sun behold"
39029,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""At evening from their tents of gold"
39030,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Upon the horizon--where they play"
39031,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Till twilight comes and ray by ray"
39032,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Their sunny mansions melt away."
39033,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Now too a chaplet might be wreathed"
39034,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Of buds o'er which the moon has breathed,"
39035,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Which worn by her whose love has strayed"
39036,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Might bring some Peri from the skies,"
39037,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Some sprite, whose very soul is made"
39038,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Of flowerets' breaths and lovers' sighs,"
39039,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""And who might tell""--"
39040,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""For me, for me,"""
39041,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Cried NOURMAHAL impatiently,--"
39042,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Oh! twine that wreath for me to-night."""
39043,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Then rapidly with foot as light
39044,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As the young musk-roe's out she flew
39045,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To cull each shining leaf that grew
39046,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Beneath the moonlight's hallowing beams
39047,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,For this enchanted Wreath of Dreams.
39048,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Anemones and Seas of Gold,[299]"
39049,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And new-blown lilies of the river,"
39050,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And those sweet flowerets that unfold
39051,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Their buds on CAMADEVA'S quiver;[300]--
39052,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The tuberose, with her silvery light,"
39053,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,That in the Gardens of Malay
39054,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Is called the Mistress of the Night,[301]"
39055,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"So like a bride, scented and bright,"
39056,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,She comes out when the sun's away:--
39057,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Amaranths such as crown the maids
39058,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,That wander thro' ZAMARA'S shades;[302]--
39059,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And the white moon-flower as it shows,"
39060,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,On SERENDIB'S high crags to those
39061,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Who near the isle at evening sail,"
39062,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Scenting her clove-trees in the gale;
39063,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"In short all flowerets and all plants,"
39064,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,From the divine Amrita tree[303]
39065,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,That blesses heaven's habitants
39066,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"With fruits of immortality,"
39067,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Down to the basil tuft[304] that waves
39068,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Its fragrant blossom over graves,"
39069,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And to the humble rosemary
39070,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Whose sweets so thanklessly are shed
39071,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To scent the desert[305]and the dead:--
39072,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,All in that garden bloom and all
39073,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Are gathered by young NOURMAHAL,"
39074,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Who heaps her baskets with the flowers
39075,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And leaves till they can hold no more;
39076,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Then to NAMOUNA flies and showers
39077,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Upon her lap the shining store.
39078,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,With what delight the Enchantress views
39079,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,So many buds bathed with the dews
39080,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And beams of that blest hour!--her glance
39081,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Spoke something past all mortal pleasures,"
39082,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As in a kind of holy trance
39083,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"She hung above those fragrant treasures,"
39084,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Bending to drink their balmy airs,"
39085,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As if she mixt her soul with theirs.
39086,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And 'twas indeed the perfume shed
39087,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,From flowers and scented flame that fed
39088,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Her charmed life--for none had e'er
39089,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Beheld her taste of mortal fare,"
39090,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Nor ever in aught earthly dip,"
39091,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"But the morn's dew, her roseate lip."
39092,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Filled with the cool, inspiring smell,"
39093,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The Enchantress now begins her spell,"
39094,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Thus singing as she winds and weaves
39095,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,In mystic form the glittering leaves:--
39096,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39097,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,I know where the winged visions dwell
39098,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,That around the night-bed play;
39099,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"I know each herb and floweret's bell,"
39100,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Where they hide their wings by day.
39101,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Then hasten we, maid,"
39102,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"To twine our braid,"
39103,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To-morrow the dreams and flowers will fade.
39104,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39105,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The image of love that nightly flies
39106,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"To visit the bashful maid,"
39107,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Steals from the jasmine flower that sighs
39108,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Its soul like her in the shade.
39109,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The dream of a future, happier hour"
39110,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"That alights on misery's brow,"
39111,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Springs out of the silvery almond-flower
39112,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,That blooms on a leafless bough.[306]
39113,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Then hasten we, maid,"
39114,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"To twine our braid,"
39115,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To-morrow the dreams and flowers will fade.
39116,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39117,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The visions that oft to worldly eyes
39118,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The glitter of mines unfold
39119,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Inhabit the mountain-herb[307] that dyes
39120,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The tooth of the fawn like gold.
39121,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The phantom shapes--oh touch not them--
39122,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"That appal the murderer's sight,"
39123,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Lurk in the fleshly mandrake's stem,"
39124,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,That shrieks when pluckt at night!
39125,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Then hasten we, maid,"
39126,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"To twine our braid,"
39127,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To-morrow the dreams and flowers will fade.
39128,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39129,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The dream of the injured, patient mind"
39130,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,That smiles at the wrongs of men
39131,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Is found in the bruised and wounded rind
39132,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Of the cinnamon, sweetest then."
39133,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Then hasten we, maid,"
39134,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"To twine our braid,"
39135,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To-morrow the dreams and flowers will fade.
39136,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39137,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,No sooner was the flowery crown
39138,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Placed on her head than sleep came down,"
39139,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Gently as nights of summer fall,"
39140,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Upon the lids of NOURMAHAL;--
39141,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And suddenly a tuneful breeze
39142,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"As full of small, rich harmonies"
39143,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As ever wind that o'er the tents
39144,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Of AZAB[308] blew was full of scents,"
39145,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Steals on her ear and floats and swells
39146,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Like the first air of morning creeping
39147,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Into those wreathy, Red-Sea shells"
39148,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Where Love himself of old lay sleeping;[309]
39149,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And now a Spirit formed, 'twould seem,"
39150,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Of music and of light,--so fair,"
39151,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"So brilliantly his features beam,"
39152,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And such a sound is in the air
39153,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Of sweetness when he waves his wings,--"
39154,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Hovers around her and thus sings:
39155,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39156,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"From CHINDARA'S[310] warbling fount I come,"
39157,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Called by that moonlight garland's spell;
39158,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"From CHINDARA'S fount, my fairy home,"
39159,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Wherein music, morn and night, I dwell."
39160,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Where lutes in the air are heard about
39161,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And voices are singing the whole day long,"
39162,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And every sigh the heart breathes out
39163,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Is turned, as it leaves the lips, to song!"
39164,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Hither I come
39165,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"From my fairy home,"
39166,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And if there's a magic in Music's strain
39167,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,I swear by the breath
39168,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Of that moonlight wreath
39169,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Thy Lover shall sigh at thy feet again.
39170,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39171,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,For mine is the lay that lightly floats
39172,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And mine are the murmuring, dying notes"
39173,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,That fall as soft as snow on the sea
39174,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And melt in the heart as instantly:--
39175,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And the passionate strain that, deeply going,"
39176,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Refines the bosom it trembles thro'
39177,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As the musk-wind over the water blowing
39178,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Ruffles the wave but sweetens it too.
39179,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39180,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Mine is the charm whose mystic sway
39181,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The Spirits of past Delight obey;--
39182,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Let but the tuneful talisman sound,"
39183,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And they come like Genii hovering round.
39184,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And mine is the gentle song that bears
39185,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"From soul to soul the wishes of love,"
39186,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As a bird that wafts thro' genial airs
39187,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The cinnamon-seed from grove to grove.[311]
39188,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39189,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,'Tis I that mingle in one sweet measure
39190,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The past, the present and future of pleasure;"
39191,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,When Memory links the tone that is gone
39192,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,With the blissful tone that's still in the ear;
39193,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And Hope from a heavenly note flies on
39194,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To a note more heavenly still that is near.
39195,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39196,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The warrior's heart when touched by me,"
39197,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Can as downy soft and as yielding be
39198,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As his own white plume that high amid death
39199,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Thro' the field has shone--yet moves with a breath!
39200,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And oh, how the eyes of Beauty glisten."
39201,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"When Music has reached her inward soul,"
39202,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Like the silent stars that wink and listen
39203,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,While Heaven's eternal melodies roll.
39204,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,So hither I come
39205,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"From my fairy home,"
39206,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And if there's a magic in Music's strain,"
39207,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,I swear by the breath
39208,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Of that moonlight wreath
39209,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Thy Lover shall sigh at thy feet again.
39210,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39211,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,'Tis dawn--at least that earlier dawn
39212,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Whose glimpses are again withdrawn,[312]"
39213,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"As if the morn had waked, and then"
39214,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Shut close her lids of light again.
39215,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And NOURMAHAL is up and trying
39216,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The wonders of her lute whose strings--
39217,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Oh, bliss!--now murmur like the sighing"
39218,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,From that ambrosial Spirit's wings.
39219,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And then her voice--'tis more than human--
39220,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Never till now had it been given
39221,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To lips of any mortal woman
39222,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To utter notes so fresh from heaven;
39223,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Sweet as the breath of angel sighs
39224,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,When angel sighs are most divine.--
39225,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Oh! let it last till night,"" she cries,"
39226,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""And he is more than ever mine."""
39227,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39228,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And hourly she renews the lay,"
39229,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,So fearful lest its heavenly sweetness
39230,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Should ere the evening fade away,--"
39231,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,For things so heavenly have such fleetness!
39232,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,But far from fading it but grows
39233,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Richer, diviner as it flows;"
39234,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Till rapt she dwells on every string
39235,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And pours again each sound along,"
39236,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Like echo, lost and languishing,"
39237,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,In love with her own wondrous song.
39238,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,

39370,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Which turns into pearls as it falls in the sea.
39371,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Oh! think what the kiss and the smile must be worth

39375,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39376,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Here sparkles the nectar that hallowed by love
39377,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Could draw down those angels of old from their sphere,"
39378,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Who for wine of this earth[338] left the fountains above,"
39379,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And forgot heaven's stars for the eyes we have here.
39380,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And, blest with the odor our goblet gives forth,"
39381,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,What Spirit the sweets of his Eden would miss?
39382,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"For, oh! if there be an Elysium on earth,"
39383,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"It is this, it is this."
39384,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39385,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The Georgian's song was scarcely mute,"
39386,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"When the same measure, sound for sound,"
39387,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Was caught up by another lute
39388,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And so divinely breathed around
39389,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"That all stood husht and wondering,"
39390,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And turned and lookt into the air,"
39391,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As if they thought to see the wing
39392,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Of ISRAFIL[339] the Angel there;--
39393,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,So powerfully on every soul
39394,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"That new, enchanted measure stole."
39395,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,While now a voice sweet as the note
39396,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Of the charmed lute was heard to float
39397,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Along its chords and so entwine
39398,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Its sounds with theirs that none knew whether
39399,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The voice or lute was most divine,"
39400,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,So wondrously they went together:--
39401,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39402,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"There's a bliss beyond all that the minstrel has told,"
39403,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"When two that are linkt in one heavenly tie,"
39404,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"With heart never changing and brow never cold,"
39405,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Love on thro' all ills and love on till they die!
39406,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,One hour of a passion so sacred is worth
39407,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Whole ages of heartless and wandering bliss;
39408,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And, oh! if there be an Elysium on earth,"
39409,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"It is this, it is this."
39410,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39411,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"'Twas not the air, 'twas not the words,"
39412,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,But that deep magic in the chords
39413,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And in the lips that gave such power
39414,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As music knew not till that hour.
39415,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"At once a hundred voices said,"
39416,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""It is the maskt Arabian maid!"""
39417,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,While SELIM who had felt the strain
39418,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Deepest of any and had lain
39419,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Some minutes rapt as in a trance
39420,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,After the fairy sounds were o'er.
39421,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Too inly touched for utterance,"
39422,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Now motioned with his hand for more:--
39423,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39424,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Fly to the desert, fly with me,"
39425,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Our Arab's tents are rude for thee;
39426,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"But oh! the choice what heart can doubt,"
39427,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Of tents with love or thrones without?
39428,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Our rocks are rough, but smiling there"
39429,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The acacia waves her yellow hair,"
39430,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Lonely and sweet nor loved the less
39431,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,For flowering in a wilderness.
39432,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39433,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Our sands are bare, but down their slope"
39434,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The silvery-footed antelope
39435,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As gracefully and gayly springs
39436,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As o'er the marble courts of kings.
39437,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39438,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Then come--thy Arab maid will be
39439,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The loved and lone acacia-tree.
39440,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The antelope whose feet shall bless
39441,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,With their light sound thy loneliness.
39442,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39443,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Oh! there are looks and tones that dart
39444,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"An instant sunshine thro' the heart,--"
39445,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As if the soul that minute caught
39446,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Some treasure it thro' life had sought;
39447,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39448,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"As if the very lips and eyes,"
39449,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Predestined to have all our sighs
39450,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And never be forgot again,"
39451,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Sparkled and spoke before us then!
39452,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39453,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"So came thy every glance and tone,"
39454,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"When first on me they breathed and shone,"
39455,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,New as if brought from other spheres
39456,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Yet welcome as if loved for years.
39457,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39458,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Then fly with me,--if thou hast known"
39459,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,No other flame nor falsely thrown
39460,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"A gem away, that thou hadst sworn"
39461,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Should ever in thy heart be worn.
39462,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39463,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Come if the love thou hast for me
39464,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Is pure and fresh as mine for thee,--"
39465,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Fresh as the fountain under ground,"
39466,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,When first 'tis by the lapwing found.[340]
39467,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39468,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,But if for me thou dost forsake
39469,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Some other maid and rudely break
39470,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Her worshipt image from its base,"
39471,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To give to me the ruined place;--
39472,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39473,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Then fare thee well--I'd rather make
39474,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,My bower upon some icy lake
39475,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,When thawing suns begin to shine
39476,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Than trust to love so false as thine.
39477,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39478,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"There was a pathos in this lay,"
39479,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"That, even without enchantment's art,"
39480,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Would instantly have found its way
39481,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Deep in to SELIM'S burning heart;
39482,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,But breathing as it did a tone
39483,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,To earthly lutes and lips unknown;
39484,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,With every chord fresh from the touch
39485,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Of Music's Spirit,--'twas too much!"
39486,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Starting he dasht away the cup,--"
39487,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,Which all the time of this sweet air
39488,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"His hand had held, untasted, up,"
39489,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As if 'twere fixt by magic there--
39490,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And naming her, so long unnamed,"
39491,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"So long unseen, wildly exclaimed,"
39492,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Oh NOURMAHAL! oh NOURMAHAL!"
39493,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Hadst thou but sung this witching strain,"
39494,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""I could forget--forgive thee all"
39495,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""And never leave those eyes again."""
39496,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39497,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The mask is off--the charm is wrought--
39498,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"And SELIM to his heart has caught,"
39499,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"In blushes, more than ever bright,"
39500,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"His NOURMAHAL, his Haram's Light!"
39501,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And well do vanisht frowns enhance
39502,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The charm of every brightened glance;
39503,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And dearer seems each dawning smile
39504,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,For having lost its light awhile:
39505,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,And happier now for all her sighs
39506,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,As on his arm her head reposes
39507,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"She whispers him, with laughing eyes,"
39508,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""Remember, love, the Feast of Roses!"""
39509,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39510,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39511,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"FADLADEEN, at the conclusion of this light rhapsody, took occasion to sum"
39512,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"up his opinion of the young Cashmerian's poetry,--of which, he trusted,"
39513,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"they had that evening heard the last.  Having recapitulated the epithets,"
39514,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"""frivolous""--""inharmonious""--""nonsensical,"" he proceeded to say that,"
39515,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,viewed in the most favorable light it resembled one of those Maldivian
39516,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"boats, to which the Princess had alluded in the relation of her dream,--"
39517,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"a slight, gilded thing, sent adrift without rudder or ballast, and with"
39518,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"nothing but vapid sweets and faded flowers on board.  The profusion,"
39519,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"indeed, of flowers and birds, which this poet had ready on all occasions,"
39520,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"--not to mention dews, gems, etc.--was a most oppressive kind of opulence"
39521,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,to his hearers; and had the unlucky effect of giving to his style all the
39522,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"glitter of the flower garden without its method, and all the flutter of"
39523,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"the aviary without its song. In addition to this, he chose his subjects"
39524,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"badly, and was always most inspired by the worst parts of them.  The"
39525,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"charms of paganism, the merits of rebellion,--these were the themes"
39526,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"honored with his particular enthusiasm; and, in the poem just recited, one"
39527,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,of his most palatable passages was in praise of that beverage of the
39528,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Unfaithful, wine;--""being, perhaps,"" said he, relaxing into a smile, as"
39529,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"conscious of his own character in the Haram on this point, ""one of those"
39530,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"bards, whose fancy owes all its illumination to the grape, like that"
39531,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"painted porcelain,[341] so curious and so rare, whose images are only"
39532,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"visible when liquor is poured into it."" Upon the whole, it was his"
39533,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"opinion, from the specimens which they had heard, and which, he begged to"
39534,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"say, were the most tiresome part of the journey, that--whatever other"
39535,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,merits this well-dressed young gentleman might possess--poetry was by no
39536,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"means his proper avocation; ""and indeed,"" concluded the critic, ""from his"
39537,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"fondness for flowers and for birds, I would venture to suggest that a"
39538,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,florist or a bird-catcher is a much more suitable calling for him than a
39539,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"poet."""
39540,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39541,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"They had now begun to ascend those barren mountains, which separate"
39542,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Cashmere from the rest of India; and, as the heats were intolerable, and"
39543,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,the time of their encampments limited to the few hours necessary for
39544,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"refreshment and repose, there was an end to all their delightful evenings,"
39545,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,and LALLA ROOKH saw no more of FERAMORZ. She now felt that her short dream
39546,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"of happiness was over, and that she had nothing but the recollection of"
39547,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"its few blissful hours, like the one draught of sweet water that serves"
39548,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"the camel across the wilderness, to be her heart's refreshment during the"
39549,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,dreary waste of life that was before her. The blight that had fallen upon
39550,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"her spirits soon found its way to her cheek, and her ladies saw with"
39551,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,regret--though not without some suspicion of the cause--that the beauty of
39552,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"their mistress, of which they were almost as proud as of their own, was"
39553,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,fast vanishing away at the very moment of all when she had most need of
39554,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"it. What must the King of Bucharia feel, when, instead of the lively and"
39555,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"beautiful LALLA ROOKH, whom the poets of Delhi had described as more"
39556,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"perfect than the divinest images in the house of AZOR,[342] he should"
39557,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"receive a pale and inanimate victim, upon whose cheek neither health nor"
39558,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"pleasure bloomed, and from whose eyes Love had fled,--to hide himself in"
39559,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,her heart?
39560,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39561,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"If any thing could have charmed away the melancholy of her spirits, it"
39562,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"would have been the fresh airs and enchanting scenery of that Valley,"
39563,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,which the Persians so justly called the Unequalled.[343] But neither the
39564,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"coolness of its atmosphere, so luxurious after toiling up those bare and"
39565,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"burning mountains,--neither the splendor of the minarets and pagodas, that"
39566,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"shone put from the depth of its woods, nor the grottoes, hermitages, and"
39567,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"miraculous fountains,[344] which make every spot of that region holy"
39568,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"ground,--neither the countless waterfalls, that rush into the Valley from"
39569,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"all those high and romantic mountains that encircle it, nor the fair city"
39570,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"on the Lake, whose houses, roofed with flowers,[345] appeared at a"
39571,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,distance like one vast and variegated parterre;--not all these wonders and
39572,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,glories of the most lovely country under the sun could steal her heart for
39573,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,a minute from those sad thoughts which but darkened and grew bitterer
39574,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,every step she advanced.
39575,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39576,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,The gay pomps and processions that met her upon her entrance into the
39577,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Valley, and the magnificence with which the roads all along were"
39578,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"decorated, did honor to the taste and gallantry of the young King. It was"
39579,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"night when they approached the city, and, for the last two miles, they had"
39580,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"passed under arches, thrown from hedge to hedge, festooned with only those"
39581,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"rarest roses from which the Attar Gul, more precious than gold, is"
39582,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"distilled, and illuminated in rich and fanciful forms with lanterns of the"
39583,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"triple-colored tortoise-shell of Pegu.[346] Sometimes, from a dark wood"
39584,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"by the side of the road, a display of fireworks would break out, so sudden"
39585,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"and so brilliant, that a Brahmin might fancy he beheld that grove, in"
39586,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"whose purple shade the God of Battles was born, bursting into a flame at"
39587,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"the moment of his birth;--while, at other times, a quick and playful"
39588,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,irradiation continued to brighten all the fields and gardens by which they
39589,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"passed, forming a line of dancing lights along the horizon; like the"
39590,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,meteors of the north as they are seen by those hunters who pursue the
39591,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,white and blue foxes on the confines of the Icy Sea.
39592,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39593,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,These arches and fireworks delighted the Ladies of the Princess
39594,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"exceedingly; and, with their usual good logic, they deduced from his taste"
39595,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"for illuminations, that the King of Bucharia would make the most exemplary"
39596,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"husband imaginable. Nor, indeed, could LALLA ROOKH herself help feeling"
39597,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,the kindness and splendor with which the young bridegroom welcomed
39598,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,her;--but she also felt how painful is the gratitude which kindness from
39599,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,those we cannot love excites; and that their best blandishments come over
39600,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,the heart with all that chilling and deadly sweetness which we can fancy
39601,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"in the cold, odoriferous wind[347] that is to blow over this earth in the"
39602,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,last days.
39603,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39604,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The marriage was fixed for the morning after her arrival, when she was,"
39605,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"for the first time, to be presented to the monarch in that Imperial Palace"
39606,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"beyond the lake, called the Shalimar.  Though never before had a night of"
39607,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"more wakeful and anxious thought been passed in the Happy Valley, yet,"
39608,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"when she rose in the morning, and her Ladies came around her, to assist in"
39609,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"the adjustment of the bridal ornaments, they thought they had never seen"
39610,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,her look half so beautiful.  What she had lost of the bloom and radiancy
39611,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"of her charms was more than made up by that intellectual expression, that"
39612,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"soul beaming forth from the eyes, which is worth all the rest of"
39613,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"loveliness. When they had tinged her fingers with the Henna leaf, and"
39614,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"placed upon her brow a small coronet of jewels, of the shape worn by the"
39615,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"ancient Queens of Bucharia, they flung over her head the rose-colored"
39616,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"bridal veil, and she proceeded to the barge that was to convey her across"
39617,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"the lake;--first kissing, with a mournful look, the little amulet of"
39618,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"cornelian, which her father at parting had hung about her neck."
39619,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39620,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The morning was as fresh and fair as the maid on whose nuptials it rose,"
39621,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"and the shining lake, all covered with boats, the minstrels playing upon"
39622,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"the shores of the islands, and the crowded summer-houses on the green"
39623,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"hills around, with shawls and banners waving from their roofs, presented"
39624,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"such a picture of animated rejoicing, as only she, who was the object of"
39625,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"it all, did not feel with transport. To LALLA ROOKH alone it was a"
39626,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"melancholy pageant; nor could she have even borne to look upon the scene,"
39627,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"were it not for a hope that among the crowds around, she might once more"
39628,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,perhaps catch a glimpse of FERAMORZ. So much was her imagination haunted
39629,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,by this thought that there was scarcely an islet or boat she passed on the
39630,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,way at which her heart did not flutter with the momentary fancy that he
39631,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"was there. Happy, in her eyes, the humblest slave upon whom the light of"
39632,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,his dear looks fell!--In the barge immediately after the Princess sat
39633,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"FADLADEEN, with his silken curtains thrown widely apart, that all might"
39634,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"have the benefit of his august presence, and with his head full of the"
39635,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"speech he was to deliver to the King, ""concerning FERAMORZ and literature"
39636,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"and the Chabuk as connected therewith."""
39637,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39638,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,They now had entered the canal which leads from the Lake to the splendid
39639,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,domes and saloons of the Shalimar and went gliding on through the gardens
39640,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"that ascended from each bank, full of flowering shrubs that made the air"
39641,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"all perfume; while from the middle of the canal rose jets of water, smooth"
39642,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"and unbroken, to such a dazzling height that they stood like tall pillars"
39643,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,of diamond in the sunshine. After sailing under the arches of various
39644,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"saloons they at length arrived at the last and most magnificent, where the"
39645,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,monarch awaited the coming of his bride; and such was the agitation of her
39646,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,heart and frame that it was with difficulty she could walk up the marble
39647,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,steps which were covered with cloth of gold for her ascent from the barge.
39648,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"At the end of the hall stood two thrones, as precious as the Cerulean"
39649,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Throne of Koolburga,[348] on one of which sat ALIRIS, the youthful King"
39650,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"of Bucharia, and on the other was in a few minutes to be placed the most"
39651,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,beautiful Princess in the world. Immediately upon the entrance of LALLA
39652,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,ROOKH into the saloon the monarch descended from his throne to meet her;
39653,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,but scarcely had he time to take her hand in his when she screamed with
39654,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"surprise and fainted at his feet. It was FERAMORZ, himself, who stood"
39655,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"before her! FERAMORZ, was, himself, the Sovereign of Bucharia, who in this"
39656,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"disguise had accompanied his young bride from Delhi, and having won her"
39657,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,love as an humble minstrel now amply deserved to enjoy it as a King.
39658,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39659,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"The consternation of FADLADEEN at this discovery was, for the moment,"
39660,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,almost pitiable. But change of opinion is a resource too convenient in
39661,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,courts for this experienced courtier not to have learned to avail himself
39662,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"of it. His criticisms were all, of course, recanted instantly: he was"
39663,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"seized with an admiration of the King's verses, as unbounded as, he begged"
39664,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"him to believe, it was disinterested; and the following week saw him in"
39665,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"possession of an additional place, swearing by all the Saints of Islam"
39666,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"that never had there existed so great a poet as the Monarch ALIRIS, and"
39667,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,moreover ready to prescribe his favorite regimen of the Chabuk for every
39668,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"man, woman and child that dared to think otherwise."
39669,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,
39670,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"Of the happiness of the King and Queen of Bucharia, after such a"
39671,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,"beginning, there can be but little doubt; and among the lesser symptoms it"
39672,THE LIGHT OF THE HARAM.,is recorded of LALLA ROOKH that to the day of her death in memory of their

41237,PREFACE.,pleasures--and the punishments both from conscience and Divine justice
41238,PREFACE.,"with which impurity, pride, and presumptuous inquiry into the awful"
41239,PREFACE.,secrets of Heaven are sure to be visited--The beautiful story of Cupid and
41240,PREFACE.,"Psyche owes its chief charm to this sort of ""veiled meaning,"" and it has"
41241,PREFACE.,been my wish (however I may have failed in the attempt) to communicate to
41242,PREFACE.,the following pages the same _moral_ interest.
41243,PREFACE.,
41244,PREFACE.,"Among the doctrines or notions derived by Plato from the East, one of the"
41245,PREFACE.,most natural and sublime is that which inculcates the pre-existence of the
41246,PREFACE.,soul and its gradual descent into this dark material world from that
41247,PREFACE.,region of spirit and light which it is supposed to have once inhabited and
41248,PREFACE.,to which after a long lapse of purification and trial it will return. This
41249,PREFACE.,belief under various symbolical forms may be traced through almost all the
41250,PREFACE.,Oriental theologies. The Chaldeans represent the Soul as originally
41251,PREFACE.,endowed with wings which fall away when it sinks from its native element
41252,PREFACE.,and must be re-produced before it can hope to return. Some disciples of
41253,PREFACE.,"Zoroaster once inquired of him, ""How the wings of the Soul might be made"
41254,PREFACE.,"to grow again?"""
41255,PREFACE.,
41256,PREFACE.,"""By sprinkling them,"" he replied, ""with the Waters of Life."""
41257,PREFACE.,
41258,PREFACE.,"""But where are those Waters to be found?"" they asked."
41259,PREFACE.,
41260,PREFACE.,"""In the Garden of God,"" replied Zoroaster."
41261,PREFACE.,
41262,PREFACE.,"The mythology of the Persians has allegorized the same doctrine, in the"
41263,PREFACE.,history of those genii of light who strayed from their dwellings in the
41264,PREFACE.,stars and obscured their original nature by mixture with this material
41265,PREFACE.,sphere; while the Egyptians connecting it with the descent and ascent of
41266,PREFACE.,the sun in the zodiac considered Autumn as emblematic of the Soul's
41267,PREFACE.,decline toward darkness and the re-appearance of Spring as its return to
41268,PREFACE.,life and light.
41269,PREFACE.,
41270,PREFACE.,"Besides the chief spirits of the Mahometan heaven, such as Gabriel the"
41271,PREFACE.,"angel of Revelation, Israfil by whom the last trumpet is to be sounded,"
41272,PREFACE.,"and Azrael the angel of death, there were also a number of subaltern"
41273,PREFACE.,"intelligences of which tradition has preserved the names, appointed to"
41274,PREFACE.,preside over the different stages of ascents into which the celestial
41275,PREFACE.,world was supposed to be divided.[2] Thus Kelail governs the fifth heaven;
41276,PREFACE.,"while Sadiel, the presiding spirit of the third, is also employed in"
41277,PREFACE.,steadying the motions of the earth which would be in a constant state of
41278,PREFACE.,agitation if this angel did not keep his foot planted upon its orb.
41279,PREFACE.,
41280,PREFACE.,Among other miraculous interpositions in favor of Mahomet we find
41281,PREFACE.,commemorated in the pages of the Koran the appearance of five thousand
41282,PREFACE.,angels on his side at the battle of Bedr.
41283,PREFACE.,
41284,PREFACE.,The ancient Persians supposed that Ormuzd appointed thirty angels to
41285,PREFACE.,preside successively over the days of the month and twelve greater ones to
41286,PREFACE.,assume the government of the months themselves; among whom Bahman (to whom
41287,PREFACE.,"Ormuzd committed the custody of all animals, except man) was the greatest."
41288,PREFACE.,"Mihr, the angel of the 7th month, was also the spirit that watched over"
41289,PREFACE.,the affairs of friendship and love;--Chûr had the care of the disk of the
41290,PREFACE.,sun;--Mah was agent for the concerns of the moon;--Isphandârmaz (whom
41291,PREFACE.,Cazvin calls the Spirit of the Earth) was the tutelar genius of good and
41292,PREFACE.,"virtuous women, etc. For all this the reader may consult the 19th and 20th"
41293,PREFACE.,"chapters of Hyde, ""_de Religione Veterum Persarum_,"" where the names and"
41294,PREFACE.,attributes of these daily and monthly angels are with much minuteness and
41295,PREFACE.,erudition explained. It appears from the Zend-avesta that the Persians had
41296,PREFACE.,a certain office or prayer for every day of the month (addressed to the
41297,PREFACE.,"particular angel who presided over it), which they called the Sirouzé."
41298,PREFACE.,
41299,PREFACE.,"The Celestial Hierarchy of the Syrians, as described by Kircher, appears"
41300,PREFACE.,to be the most regularly graduated of any of these systems. In the sphere
41301,PREFACE.,"of the Moon they placed the angels, in that of Mercury the archangels,"
41302,PREFACE.,Venus and the Sun contained the Principalities and the Powers;--and so on
41303,PREFACE.,"to the summit of the planetary system, where, in the sphere of Saturn, the"
41304,PREFACE.,Thrones had their station. Above this was the habitation of the Cherubim
41305,PREFACE.,"in the sphere of the fixed stars; and still higher, in the region of those"
41306,PREFACE.,"stars which are so distant as to be imperceptible, the Seraphim, we are"
41307,PREFACE.,"told, the most perfect of all celestial creatures, dwelt."
41308,PREFACE.,
41309,PREFACE.,"The Sabeans also (as D'Herbelot tells us) had their classes of angels, to"
41310,PREFACE.,"whom they prayed as mediators, or intercessors; and the Arabians"
41311,PREFACE.,"worshipped _female_ angels, whom they called Benab Hasche, or, Daughters"

41465,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,The despotism that from that hour
41466,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Passion held o'er me. Day and night
41467,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,I sought around each neighboring spot;
41468,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And in the chase of this sweet light,"
41469,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,My task and heaven and all forgot;--
41470,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"All but the one, sole, haunting dream"
41471,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Of her I saw in that bright stream.
41472,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41473,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Nor was it long ere by her side
41474,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,I found myself whole happy days
41475,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Listening to words whose music vied
41476,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"With our own Eden's seraph lays,"
41477,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"When seraph lays are warmed by love,"
41478,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"But wanting _that_ far, far above!--"
41479,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And looking into eyes where, blue"
41480,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And beautiful, like skies seen thro'"
41481,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"The sleeping wave, for me there shone"
41482,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"A heaven, more worshipt than my own."
41483,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Oh what, while I could hear and see"
41484,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Such words and looks, was heaven to me?"
41485,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41486,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Tho' gross the air on earth I drew,"
41487,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"'Twas blessed, while she breathed it too;"
41488,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Tho' dark the flowers, tho' dim the sky,"
41489,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Love lent them light while she was nigh.
41490,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Throughout creation I but knew
41491,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Two separate worlds--the _one_, that small,"
41492,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Beloved and consecrated spot
41493,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Where LEA was--the other, all"
41494,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"The dull, wide waste where she was _not_!"
41495,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41496,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"But vain my suit, my madness vain;"
41497,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Tho' gladly, from her eyes to gain"
41498,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"One earthly look, one stray desire,"
41499,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,I would have torn the wings that hung
41500,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Furled at my back and o'er the Fire
41501,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,In GEHIM'S[4] pit their fragments flung;--
41502,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,'Twas hopeless all--pure and unmoved
41503,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,She stood as lilies in the light
41504,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Of the hot noon but look more white;--
41505,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And tho' she loved me, deeply loved,"
41506,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"'Twas not as man, as mortal--no,"
41507,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Nothing of earth was in that glow--
41508,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"She loved me but as one, of race"
41509,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Angelic, from that radiant place"
41510,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,She saw so oft in dreams--that Heaven
41511,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,To which her prayers at morn were sent
41512,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And on whose light she gazed at even,"
41513,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Wishing for wings that she might go
41514,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Out of this shadowy world below
41515,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"To that free, glorious element!"
41516,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41517,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Well I remember by her side
41518,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Sitting at rosy even-tide,"
41519,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"When,--turning to the star whose head"
41520,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Lookt out as from a bridal bed,"
41521,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"At that mute, blushing hour,--she said,"
41522,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Oh! that it were my doom to be"
41523,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""The Spirit of yon beauteous star,"
41524,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Dwelling up there in purity,"
41525,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Alone as all such bright things are;--"
41526,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""My sole employ to pray and shine,"
41527,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""To light my censer at the sun,"
41528,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And cast its fire towards the shrine"
41529,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Of Him in heaven, the Eternal One!"""
41530,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41531,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"So innocent the maid, so free"
41532,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"From mortal taint in soul and frame,"
41533,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Whom 'twas my crime--my destiny--
41534,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"To love, ay, burn for, with a flame"
41535,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,To which earth's wildest fires are tame.
41536,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Had you but seen her look when first
41537,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,From my mad lips the avowal burst;
41538,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Not angered--no!--the feeling came
41539,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,From depths beyond mere anger's flame--
41540,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"It was a _sorrow_ calm as deep,"
41541,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"A mournfulness that could not weep,"
41542,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"So filled her heart was to the brink,"
41543,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,So fixt and frozen with grief to think
41544,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,That angel natures--that even I
41545,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Whose love she clung to, as the tie"
41546,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Between her spirit and the sky--
41547,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Should fall thus headlong from the height
41548,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Of all that heaven hath pure and bright!
41549,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41550,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,That very night--my heart had grown
41551,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Impatient of its inward burning;
41552,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"The term, too, of my stay was flown,"
41553,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And the bright Watchers near the throne.
41554,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Already, if a meteor shone"
41555,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Between them and this nether zone,"
41556,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Thought 'twas their herald's wing returning.
41557,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Oft did the potent spell-word, given"
41558,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"To Envoys hither from the skies,"
41559,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,To be pronounced when back to heaven
41560,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"It is their time or wish to rise,"
41561,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Come to my lips that fatal day;
41562,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And once too was so nearly spoken,"
41563,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,That my spread plumage in the ray
41564,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And breeze of heaven began to play;--
41565,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,When my heart failed--the spell was broken--
41566,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"The word unfinisht died away,"
41567,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And my checkt plumes ready to soar,"
41568,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Fell slack and lifeless as before.
41569,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"How could I leave a world which she,"
41570,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Or lost or won, made all to me?"
41571,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"No matter where my wanderings were,"
41572,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"So there she lookt, breathed, moved about--"
41573,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Woe, ruin, death, more sweet with her,"
41574,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Than Paradise itself, without!"
41575,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41576,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,But to return--that very day
41577,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"A feast was held, where, full of mirth,"
41578,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Came--crowding thick as flowers that play
41579,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,In summer winds--the young and gay
41580,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And beautiful of this bright earth.
41581,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And she was there and mid the young
41582,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And beautiful stood first, alone;"
41583,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Tho' on her gentle brow still hung
41584,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,The shadow I that morn had thrown--
41585,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,The first that ever shame or woe
41586,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Had cast upon its vernal snow.
41587,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,My heart was maddened;--in the flush
41588,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Of the wild revel I gave way
41589,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,To all that frantic mirth--that rush
41590,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of desperate gayety which they,"
41591,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Who never felt how pain's excess
41592,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Can break out thus, think happiness!"
41593,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Sad mimicry of mirth and life
41594,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Whose flashes come but from the strife
41595,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Of inward passions--like the light
41596,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Struck out by clashing swords in fight.
41597,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41598,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Then too that juice of earth, the bane"
41599,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And blessing of man's heart and brain--
41600,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,That draught of sorcery which brings
41601,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Phantoms of fair, forbidden things--"
41602,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Whose drops like those of rainbows smile
41603,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Upon the mists that circle man,"
41604,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Brightening not only Earth the while,"
41605,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,But grasping Heaven too in their span!--
41606,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Then first the fatal wine-cup rained
41607,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Its dews of darkness thro' my lips,"
41608,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Casting whate'er of light remained
41609,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,To my lost soul into eclipse;
41610,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And filling it with such wild dreams,"
41611,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Such fantasies and wrong desires,"
41612,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,As in the absence of heaven's beams
41613,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Haunt us for ever--like wildfires
41614,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,That walk this earth when day retires.
41615,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41616,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Now hear the rest;--our banquet done,"
41617,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"I sought her in the accustomed bower,"
41618,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Where late we oft, when day was gone"
41619,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And the world husht, had met alone,"
41620,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"At the same silent, moonlight hour."
41621,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Her eyes as usual were upturned
41622,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,To her loved star whose lustre burned
41623,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Purer than ever on that night;
41624,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,While she in looking grew more bright
41625,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,As tho' she borrowed of its light.
41626,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41627,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"There was a virtue in that scene,"
41628,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"A spell of holiness around,"
41629,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Which had my burning brain not been
41630,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thus maddened would have held me bound,"
41631,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,As tho' I trod celestial ground.
41632,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Even as it was, with soul all flame"
41633,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And lips that burned in their own sighs,"
41634,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,I stood to gaze with awe and shame--
41635,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,The memory of Eden came
41636,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Full o'er me when I saw those eyes;
41637,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And tho' too well each glance of mine
41638,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"To the pale, shrinking maiden proved"
41639,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"How far, alas! from aught divine,"
41640,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Aught worthy of so pure a shrine,"
41641,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Was the wild love with which I loved,"
41642,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Yet must she, too, have seen--oh yes,"
41643,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,'Tis soothing but to _think_ she saw
41644,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"The deep, true, soul-felt tenderness,"
41645,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,The homage of an Angel's awe
41646,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"To her, a mortal, whom pure love"
41647,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Then placed above him--far above--
41648,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And all that struggle to repress
41649,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"A sinful spirit's mad excess,"
41650,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which workt within me at that hour,"
41651,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,When with a voice where Passion shed
41652,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"All the deep sadness of her power,"
41653,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Her melancholy power--I said,"
41654,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Then be it so; if back to heaven"
41655,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""I must unloved, unpitied fly."
41656,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Without one blest memorial given"
41657,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""To soothe me in that lonely sky;"
41658,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""One look like those the young and fond"
41659,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Give when they're parting--which would be,"
41660,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Even in remembrance far beyond"
41661,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""All heaven hath left of bliss for me!"
41662,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41663,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Oh, but to see that head recline"
41664,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""A minute on this trembling arm,"
41665,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And those mild eyes look up to mine,"
41666,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Without a dread, a thought of harm!"
41667,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""To meet but once the thrilling touch"
41668,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Of lips too purely fond to fear me--"
41669,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Or if that boon be all too much,"
41670,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Even thus to bring their fragrance near me!"
41671,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Nay, shrink not so--a look--a word--"
41672,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Give them but kindly and I fly;"
41673,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Already, see, my plumes have stirred"
41674,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And tremble for their home on high."
41675,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Thus be our parting--cheek to cheek--"
41676,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""One minute's lapse will be forgiven,"
41677,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And thou, the next, shalt hear me speak"
41678,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""The spell that plumes my wing for heaven!"""
41679,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41680,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"While thus I spoke, the fearful maid,"
41681,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of me and of herself afraid,"
41682,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Had shrinking stood like flowers beneath
41683,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,The scorching of the south-wind's breath:
41684,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"But when I named--alas, too well,"
41685,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"I now recall, tho' wildered then,--"
41686,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Instantly, when I named the spell"
41687,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Her brow, her eyes uprose again;"
41688,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And with an eagerness that spoke
41689,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"The sudden light that o'er her broke,"
41690,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""The spell, the spell!--oh, speak it now."
41691,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And I will bless thee!"" she exclaimed--"
41692,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Unknowing what I did, inflamed,"
41693,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And lost already, on her brow"
41694,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"I stampt one burning kiss, and named"
41695,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,The mystic word till then ne'er told
41696,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,To living creature of earth's mould!
41697,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Scarce was it said when quick a thought,"
41698,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Her lips from mine like echo caught
41699,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,The holy sound--her hands and eyes
41700,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Were instant lifted to the skies,"
41701,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And thrice to heaven she spoke it out
41702,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"With that triumphant look Faith wears,"
41703,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"When not a cloud of fear or doubt,"
41704,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,A vapor from this vale of tears.
41705,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Between her and her God appears!
41706,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,That very moment her whole frame
41707,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"All bright and glorified became,"
41708,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And at her back I saw unclose
41709,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Two wings magnificent as those
41710,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"That sparkle around ALLA'S Throne,"
41711,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Whose plumes, as buoyantly she rose"
41712,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Above me, in the moon-beam shone"
41713,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"With a pure light; which--from its hue,"
41714,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Unknown upon this earth--I knew
41715,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Was light from Eden, glistening thro'!"
41716,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Most holy vision! ne'er before
41717,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Did aught so radiant--since the day
41718,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"When EBLIS in his downfall, bore"
41719,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,The third of the bright stars away--
41720,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Rise in earth's beauty to repair
41721,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,That loss of light and glory there!
41722,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41723,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,But did I tamely view her flight?
41724,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Did not I too proclaim out thrice
41725,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"The powerful words that were that night,--"
41726,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Oh even for heaven too much delight!--
41727,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Again to bring us, eyes to eyes"
41728,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And soul to soul, in Paradise?"
41729,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,I did--I spoke it o'er and o'er--
41730,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"I prayed, I wept, but all in vain;"
41731,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,For me the spell had power no more.
41732,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,There seemed around me some dark chain
41733,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Which still as I essayed to soar
41734,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Baffled, alas, each wild endeavor;"
41735,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Dead lay my wings as they have lain
41736,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Since that sad hour and will remain--
41737,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,So wills the offended God--for ever!
41738,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41739,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,It was to yonder star I traced
41740,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Her journey up the illumined waste--
41741,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,That isle in the blue firmament
41742,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,To which so oft her fancy went
41743,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"In wishes and in dreams before,"
41744,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And which was now--such, Purity,"
41745,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Thy blest reward--ordained to be
41746,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Her home of light for evermore!
41747,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Once--or did I but fancy so?--
41748,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Even in her flight to that fair sphere,"
41749,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Mid all her spirit's new-felt glow,"
41750,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,A pitying look she turned below
41751,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,On him who stood in darkness here;
41752,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Him whom perhaps if vain regret
41753,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Can dwell in heaven she pities yet;
41754,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And oft when looking to this dim
41755,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And distant world remembers him.
41756,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41757,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,But soon that passing dream was gone;
41758,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Farther and farther off she shone,"
41759,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Till lessened to a point as small
41760,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"As are those specks that yonder burn,--"
41761,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Those vivid drops of light that fall
41762,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,The last from Day's exhausted urn.
41763,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And when at length she merged, afar,"
41764,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Into her own immortal star,"
41765,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And when at length my straining sight
41766,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Had caught her wing's last fading ray,"
41767,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,That minute from my soul the light
41768,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Of heaven and love both past away;
41769,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And I forgot my home, my birth,"
41770,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Profaned my spirit, sunk my brow,"
41771,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And revelled in gross joys of earth
41772,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Till I became--what I am now!
41773,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41774,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,The Spirit bowed his head in shame;
41775,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,A shame that of itself would tell--
41776,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Were there not even those breaks of flame,"
41777,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Celestial, thro' his clouded frame--"
41778,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,How grand the height from which he fell!
41779,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,That holy Shame which ne'er forgets
41780,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,The unblenched renown it used to wear;
41781,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Whose blush remains when Virtue sets
41782,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,To show her sunshine _has_ been there.
41783,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41784,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Once only while the tale he told
41785,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Were his eyes lifted to behold
41786,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"That happy stainless, star where she"
41787,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Dwelt in her bower of purity!
41788,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,One minute did he look and then--
41789,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,As tho' he felt some deadly pain
41790,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,From its sweet light thro' heart and brain--
41791,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Shrunk back and never lookt again.
41792,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41793,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Who was the Second Spirit? he
41794,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,With the proud front and piercing glance--
41795,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Who seemed when viewing heaven's expanse
41796,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,As tho' his far-sent eye could see
41797,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"On, on into the Immensity"
41798,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Behind the veils of that blue sky
41799,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Where ALLA'S grandest secrets lie?--
41800,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"His wings, the while, tho' day was gone,"
41801,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Flashing with many a various hue
41802,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of light they from themselves alone,"
41803,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Instinct with Eden's brightness drew.
41804,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,'Twas RUBI--once among the prime
41805,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And flower of those bright creatures, named"
41806,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Spirits of Knowledge,[5] who o'er Time"
41807,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And Space and Thought an empire claimed,"
41808,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Second alone to Him whose light
41809,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Was even to theirs as day to night;
41810,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,'Twixt whom and them was distance far
41811,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And wide as would the journey be
41812,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,To reach from any island star
41813,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,To vague shores of Infinity
41814,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41815,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,'Twas RUBI in whose mournful eye
41816,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Slept the dim light of days gone by;
41817,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Whose voice tho' sweet fell on the ear
41818,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Like echoes in some silent place
41819,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,When first awaked for many a year;
41820,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"And when he smiled, if o'er his face"
41821,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Smile ever shone, 'twas like the grace"
41822,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of moonlight rainbows, fair, but wan,"
41823,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"The sunny life, the glory gone."
41824,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Even o'er his pride tho' still the same,"
41825,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,A softening shade from sorrow came;
41826,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And tho' at times his spirit knew
41827,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"The kindlings of disdain and ire,"
41828,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Short was the fitful glare they threw--
41829,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"Like the last flashes, fierce but few,"
41830,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Seen thro' some noble pile on fire!
41831,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Such was the Angel who now broke
41832,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,"The silence that had come o'er all,"
41833,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,When he the Spirit that last spoke
41834,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Closed the sad history of his fall;
41835,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And while a sacred lustre flown
41836,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,For many a day relumed his cheek--
41837,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Beautiful as in days of old;
41838,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,And not those eloquent lips alone
41839,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,But every feature seemed to speak--
41840,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,Thus his eventful story told:--
41841,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41842,FIRST ANGEL'S STORY.,
41843,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.
41844,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
41845,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
41846,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,You both remember well the day
41847,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,When unto Eden's new-made bowers
41848,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,ALLA convoked the bright array
41849,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of his supreme angelic powers
41850,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To witness the one wonder yet,"
41851,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Beyond man, angel, star, or sun,"
41852,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"He must achieve, ere he could set"
41853,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,His seal upon the world as done--
41854,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To see the last perfection rise,"
41855,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That crowning of creation's birth,"
41856,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,When mid the worship and surprise
41857,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of circling angels Woman's eyes
41858,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,First open upon heaven and earth;
41859,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And from their lids a thrill was sent,"
41860,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That thro' each living spirit went
41861,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Like first light thro' the firmament!
41862,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
41863,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Can you forget how gradual stole
41864,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The fresh-awakened breath of soul
41865,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Throughout her perfect form--which seemed
41866,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To grow transparent as there beamed
41867,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That dawn of Mind within and caught
41868,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,New loveliness from each new thought?
41869,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Slow as o'er summer seas we trace
41870,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The progress of the noontide air,"
41871,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Dimpling its bright and silent face
41872,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Each minute into some new grace,"
41873,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And varying heaven's reflections there--
41874,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Or like the light of evening stealing
41875,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,O'er some fair temple which all day
41876,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Hath slept in shadow, slow revealing"
41877,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Its several beauties ray by ray,"
41878,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Till it shines out, a thing to bless,"
41879,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,All full of light and loveliness.
41880,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
41881,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Can you forget her blush when round
41882,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thro' Eden's lone, enchanted ground"
41883,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"She lookt, and saw the sea--the skies--"
41884,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And heard the rush of many a wing,"
41885,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,On high behests then vanishing;
41886,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And saw the last few angel eyes,"
41887,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Still lingering--mine among the rest,--"
41888,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Reluctant leaving scenes so blest?
41889,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,From that miraculous hour the fate
41890,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of this new, glorious Being dwelt"
41891,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,For ever with a spell-like weight
41892,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Upon my spirit--early, late,"
41893,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Whate'er I did or dreamed or felt,"
41894,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The thought of what might yet befall
41895,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That matchless creature mixt with all.--
41896,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Nor she alone but her whole race
41897,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Thro' ages yet to come--whate'er
41898,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of feminine and fond and fair
41899,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Should spring from that pure mind and face,"
41900,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,All waked my soul's intensest care;
41901,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Their forms, souls, feelings, still to me"
41902,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Creation's strangest mystery!
41903,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
41904,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"It was my doom--even from the first,"
41905,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,When witnessing the primal burst
41906,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of Nature's wonders, I saw rise"
41907,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Those bright creations in the skies,--"
41908,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Those worlds instinct with life and light,"
41909,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which Man, remote, but sees by night,--"
41910,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,It was my doom still to be haunted
41911,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"By some new wonder, some sublime"
41912,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And matchless work, that for the time"
41913,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Held all my soul enchained, enchanted,"
41914,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And left me not a thought, a dream,"
41915,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,A word but on that only theme!
41916,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
41917,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The wish to know--that endless thirst,"
41918,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which even by quenching is awaked,"
41919,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And which becomes or blest or curst
41920,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,As is the fount whereat 'tis slaked--
41921,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Still urged me onward with desire
41922,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Insatiate, to explore, inquire--"
41923,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Whate'er the wondrous things might be
41924,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That waked each new idolatry--
41925,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Their cause, aim, source, whenever sprung--"
41926,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Their inmost powers, as tho' for me"
41927,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Existence on that knowledge hung.
41928,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
41929,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Oh what a vision were the stars
41930,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"When first I saw them born on high,"
41931,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Rolling along like living cars
41932,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of light for gods to journey by![6]
41933,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,They were like my heart's first passion--days
41934,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And nights unwearied, in their rays"
41935,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Have I hung floating till each sense
41936,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Seemed full of their bright influence.
41937,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Innocent joy! alas, how much"
41938,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of misery had I shunned below,"
41939,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Could I have still lived blest with such;
41940,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Nor, proud and restless, burned to know"
41941,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The knowledge that brings guilt and woe.
41942,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
41943,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Often--so much I loved to trace
41944,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The secrets of this starry race--
41945,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Have I at morn and evening run
41946,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Along the lines of radiance spun
41947,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Like webs between them and the sun,"
41948,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Untwisting all the tangled ties
41949,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of light into their different dyes--
41950,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The fleetly winged I off in quest
41951,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of those, the farthest, loneliest,"
41952,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That watch like winking sentinels,[7]"
41953,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The void, beyond which Chaos dwells;"
41954,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And there with noiseless plume pursued
41955,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Their track thro' that grand solitude,"
41956,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Asking intently all and each
41957,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"What soul within their radiance dwelt,"
41958,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And wishing their sweet light were speech,"
41959,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That they might tell me all they felt.
41960,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
41961,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Nay, oft, so passionate my chase,"
41962,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of these resplendent heirs of space,"
41963,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Oft did I follow--lest a ray
41964,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Should 'scape me in the farthest night--
41965,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Some pilgrim Comet on his way
41966,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To visit distant shrines of light,"
41967,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And well remember how I sung
41968,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Exultingly when on my sight
41969,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,New worlds of stars all fresh and young
41970,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,As if just born of darkness sprung!
41971,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
41972,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Such was my pure ambition then,"
41973,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,My sinless transport night and morn
41974,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Ere yet this newer world of men,"
41975,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And that most fair of stars was born
41976,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Which I in fatal hour saw rise
41977,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Among the flowers of Paradise!
41978,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
41979,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thenceforth my nature all was changed,"
41980,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"My heart, soul, senses turned below;"
41981,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And he who but so lately ranged
41982,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Yon wonderful expanse where glow
41983,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Worlds upon worlds,--yet found his mind"
41984,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Even in that luminous range confined,--"
41985,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Now blest the humblest, meanest sod"
41986,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of the dark earth where Woman trod!
41987,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,In vain my former idols glistened
41988,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,From their far thrones; in vain these ears
41989,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To the once-thrilling music listened,"
41990,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That hymned around my favorite spheres--
41991,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To earth, to earth each thought was given,"
41992,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That in this half-lost soul had birth;
41993,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Like some high mount, whose head's in heaven"
41994,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,While its whole shadow rests on earth!
41995,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
41996,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Nor was it Love, even yet, that thralled"
41997,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,My spirit in his burning ties;
41998,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And less, still less could it be called"
41999,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That grosser flame, round which Love flies"
42000,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Nearer and near till he dies--
42001,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"No, it was wonder, such as thrilled"
42002,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,At all God's works my dazzled sense;
42003,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The same rapt wonder, only filled"
42004,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"With passion, more profound, intense,--"
42005,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"A vehement, but wandering fire,"
42006,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which, tho' nor love, nor yet desire,--"
42007,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Tho' thro' all womankind it took
42008,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Its range, its lawless lightnings run,"
42009,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Yet wanted but a touch, a look,"
42010,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To fix it burning upon _One_.
42011,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42012,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Then too the ever-restless zeal,"
42013,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The insatiate curiosity,"
42014,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To know how shapes so fair must feel--
42015,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To look but once beneath the seal
42016,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of so much loveliness and see
42017,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,What souls belonged to such bright eyes--
42018,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Whether as sunbeams find their way
42019,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Into the gem that hidden lies,"
42020,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Those looks could inward turn their ray,"
42021,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And make the soul as bright as they:
42022,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,All this impelled my anxious chase.
42023,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And still the more I saw and knew
42024,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of Woman's fond, weak, conquering race,"
42025,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The intenser still my wonder grew.
42026,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"I had beheld their First, their EVE,"
42027,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Born in that splendid Paradise,"
42028,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Which sprung there solely to receive
42029,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The first light of her waking eyes.
42030,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,I had seen purest angels lean
42031,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,In worship o'er her from above;
42032,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And man--oh yes, had envying seen"
42033,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Proud man possest of all her love.
42034,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42035,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"I saw their happiness, so brief,"
42036,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"So exquisite,--her error, too,"
42037,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That easy trust, that prompt belief"
42038,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,In what the warm heart wishes true;
42039,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That faith in words, when kindly said."
42040,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,By which the whole fond sex is led
42041,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Mingled with--what I durst not blame,"
42042,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"For 'tis my own--that zeal to _know_,"
42043,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Sad, fatal zeal, so sure of woe;"
42044,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which, tho' from heaven all pure it came,"
42045,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Yet stained, misused, brought sin and shame"
42046,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"On her, on me, on all below!"
42047,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42048,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"I had seen this; had seen Man, armed"
42049,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"As his soul is with strength and sense,"
42050,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,By her first words to ruin charmed;
42051,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"His vaunted reason's cold defence,"
42052,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Like an ice-barrier in the ray
42053,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of melting summer, smiled away."
42054,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Nay, stranger yet, spite of all this--"
42055,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Tho' by her counsels taught to err,"
42056,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Tho' driven from Paradise for her,"
42057,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"(And _with_ her--_that_ at least was bliss,)"
42058,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Had I not heard him ere he crost
42059,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The threshold of that earthly heaven,"
42060,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Which by her bewildering smile he lost--
42061,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,So quickly was the wrong forgiven--
42062,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Had I not heard him, as he prest"
42063,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The frail, fond trembler to a breast"
42064,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which she had doomed to sin and strife,"
42065,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Call her--even then--his Life! his Life![8]
42066,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Yes, such a love-taught name, the first,"
42067,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That ruined Man to Woman gave,"
42068,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Even in his outcast hour, when curst"
42069,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"By her fond witchery, with that worst"
42070,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And earliest boon of love, the grave!"
42071,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,She who brought death into the world
42072,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"There stood before him, with the light"
42073,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of their lost Paradise still bright
42074,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Upon those sunny locks that curled
42075,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Down her white shoulders to her feet--
42076,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"So beautiful in form, so sweet"
42077,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"In heart and voice, as to redeem"
42078,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The loss, the death of all things dear,"
42079,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Except herself--and make it seem
42080,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Life, endless Life, while she was near!"
42081,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Could I help wondering at a creature,"
42082,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Thus circled round with spells so strong--
42083,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"One to whose every thought, word, feature."
42084,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"In joy and woe, thro' right and wrong,"
42085,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Such sweet omnipotence heaven gave,"
42086,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To bless or ruin, curse or save?"
42087,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42088,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Nor did the marvel cease with her--
42089,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"New Eves in all her daughters came,"
42090,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"As strong to charm, as weak to err,"
42091,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"As sure of man thro' praise and blame,"
42092,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Whate'er they brought him, pride or shame,"
42093,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"He still the unreasoning worshipper,"
42094,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And they, throughout all time, the same"
42095,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Enchantresses of soul and frame,"
42096,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Into whose hands, from first to last,"
42097,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"This world with all its destinies,"
42098,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Devotedly by heaven seems cast,"
42099,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To save or ruin as they please!
42100,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Oh! 'tis not to be told how long,"
42101,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,How restlessly I sighed to find
42102,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Some _one_ from out that witching throng,"
42103,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Some abstract of the form and mind
42104,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of the whole matchless sex, from which,"
42105,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"In my own arms beheld, possest,"
42106,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"I might learn all the powers to witch,"
42107,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To warm, and (if my fate unblest"
42108,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"_Would_ have it) ruin, of the rest!"
42109,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Into whose inward soul and sense,"
42110,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"I might descend, as doth the bee"
42111,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Into the flower's deep heart, and thence"
42112,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Rifle in all its purity
42113,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The prime, the quintessence, the whole"
42114,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of wondrous Woman's frame and soul!
42115,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"At length my burning wish, my prayer--"
42116,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"(For such--oh! what will tongues not dare,"
42117,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,When hearts go wrong?--this lip preferred)--
42118,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,At length my ominous prayer was heard--
42119,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"But whether heard in heaven or hell,"
42120,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Listen--and thou wilt know _too_ well.
42121,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42122,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"There was a maid, of all who move"
42123,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Like visions o'er this orb most fit.
42124,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To be a bright young angel's love--
42125,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Herself so bright, so exquisite!"
42126,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The pride too of her step, as light"
42127,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Along the unconscious earth she went,"
42128,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Seemed that of one born with a right
42129,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To walk some heavenlier element,"
42130,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And tread in places where her feet
42131,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,A star at every step should meet.
42132,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,'Twas not alone that loveliness
42133,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,By which the wildered sense is caught--
42134,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of lips whose very breath could bless;
42135,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of playful blushes that seemed naught
42136,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,But luminous escapes of thought;
42137,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of eyes that, when by anger stirred,"
42138,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Were fire itself, but at a word"
42139,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of tenderness, all soft became"
42140,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"As tho' they could, like the sun's bird,"
42141,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Dissolve away in their own flame--
42142,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of form, as pliant as the shoots"
42143,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of a young tree, in vernal flower;"
42144,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Yet round and glowing as the fruits,"
42145,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That drop from it in summer's hour;--
42146,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,'Twas not alone this loveliness
42147,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That falls to loveliest women's share,"
42148,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Tho' even here her form could spare
42149,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,From its own beauty's rich excess
42150,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Enough to make even _them_ more fair--
42151,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,But 'twas the Mind outshining clear
42152,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thro' her whole frame--the soul, still near,"
42153,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To light each charm, yet independent"
42154,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of what it lighted, as the sun"
42155,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That shines on flowers would be resplendent
42156,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Were there no flowers to shine upon--
42157,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"'Twas this, all this, in one combined--"
42158,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The unnumbered looks and arts that form
42159,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The glory of young womankind,"
42160,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Taken, in their perfection, warm,"
42161,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Ere time had chilled a single charm,"
42162,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And stampt with such a seal of Mind,"
42163,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,As gave to beauties that might be
42164,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Too sensual else, too unrefined,"
42165,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The impress of Divinity!
42166,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42167,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"'Twas this--a union, which the hand"
42168,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of Nature kept for her alone,"
42169,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of every thing most playful, bland,"
42170,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Voluptuous, spiritual, grand,"
42171,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,In angel-natures and her own--
42172,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Oh! this it was that drew me nigh
42173,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"One, who seemed kin to heaven as I,"
42174,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,A bright twin-sister from on high--
42175,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"One in whose love, I felt, were given"
42176,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The mixt delights of either sphere,"
42177,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"All that the spirit seeks in heaven,"
42178,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And all the senses burn for here.
42179,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42180,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Had we--but hold!--hear every part
42181,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of our sad tale--spite of the pain
42182,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Remembrance gives, when the fixt dart"
42183,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Is stirred thus in the wound again--
42184,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Hear every step, so full of bliss,"
42185,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And yet so ruinous, that led"
42186,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Down to the last, dark precipice,"
42187,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Where perisht both--the fallen, the dead!"
42188,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42189,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"From the first hour she caught my sight,"
42190,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,I never left her--day and night
42191,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Hovering unseen around her way,"
42192,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And mid her loneliest musings near,"
42193,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"I soon could track each thought that lay,"
42194,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Gleaming within her heart, as clear"
42195,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,As pebbles within brooks appear;
42196,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And there among the countless things
42197,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That keep young hearts for ever glowing--
42198,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Vague wishes, fond imaginings,"
42199,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Love-dreams, as yet no object knowing--"
42200,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Light, winged hopes that come when bid,"
42201,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And rainbow joys that end in weeping;
42202,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And passions among pure thoughts hid,"
42203,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Like serpents under flowerets sleeping:--
42204,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,'Mong all these feelings--felt where'er
42205,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Young hearts are beating--I saw there
42206,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Proud thoughts, aspirings high--beyond"
42207,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Whate'er yet dwelt in soul so fond--
42208,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Glimpses of glory, far away"
42209,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Into the bright, vague future given;"
42210,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And fancies, free and grand, whose play,"
42211,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Like that of eaglets, is near heaven!"
42212,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"With this, too--what a soul and heart"
42213,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To fall beneath the tempter's art!--
42214,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"A zeal for knowledge, such as ne'er"
42215,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Enshrined itself in form so fair,"
42216,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Since that first, fatal hour, when Eve,"
42217,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,With every fruit of Eden blest
42218,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Save one alone--rather than leave
42219,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That _one_ unreached, lost all the rest."
42220,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42221,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,It was in dreams that first I stole
42222,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,With gentle mastery o'er her mind--
42223,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"In that rich twilight of the soul,"
42224,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"When reason's beam, half hid behind"
42225,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The clouds of sleep, obscurely gilds"
42226,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Each shadowy shape that Fancy builds--
42227,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,'Twas then by that soft light I brought
42228,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Vague, glimmering visions to her view,--"
42229,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Catches of radiance lost when caught,"
42230,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Bright labyrinths that led to naught,"
42231,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And vistas with no pathway thro';--
42232,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Dwellings of bliss that opening shone,"
42233,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Then closed, dissolved, and left no trace--"
42234,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"All that, in short, could tempt Hope on,"
42235,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,But give her wing no resting-place;
42236,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Myself the while with brow as yet
42237,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Pure as the young moon's coronet,"
42238,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Thro' every dream _still_ in her sight.
42239,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The enchanter of each mocking scene,"
42240,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Who gave the hope, then brought the blight,"
42241,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Who said, ""Behold yon world of light,"""
42242,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Then sudden dropt a veil between!
42243,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42244,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"At length when I perceived each thought,"
42245,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Waking or sleeping, fixt on naught"
42246,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,But these illusive scenes and me--
42247,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The phantom who thus came and went,"
42248,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"In half revealments, only meant"
42249,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To madden curiosity--
42250,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,When by such various arts I found
42251,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Her fancy to its utmost wound.
42252,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,One night--'twas in a holy spot
42253,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Which she for prayer had chosen--a grot
42254,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of purest marble built below
42255,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Her garden beds, thro' which a glow"
42256,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"From lamps invisible then stole,"
42257,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Brightly pervading all the place--
42258,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Like that mysterious light the soul,"
42259,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Itself unseen, sheds thro' the face."
42260,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"There at her altar while she knelt,"
42261,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And all that woman ever felt,"
42262,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,When God and man both claimed her sighs--
42263,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Every warm thought, that ever dwelt,"
42264,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Like summer clouds, 'twixt earth and skies,"
42265,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Too pure to fall, too gross to rise,"
42266,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Spoke in her gestures, tones, and eyes--"
42267,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Then, as the mystic light's soft ray"
42268,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Grew softer still, as tho' its ray"
42269,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Was breathed from her, I heard her say:--"
42270,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42271,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""O idol of my dreams! whate'er"
42272,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Thy nature be--human, divine,"
42273,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Or but half heavenly--still too fair,"
42274,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Too heavenly to be ever mine!"
42275,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42276,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Wonderful Spirit who dost make"
42277,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Slumber so lovely that it seems"
42278,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""No longer life to live awake,"
42279,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Since heaven itself descends in dreams,"
42280,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42281,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Why do I ever lose thee? why"
42282,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""When on thy realms and thee I gaze"
42283,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Still drops that veil, which I could die,"
42284,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Oh! gladly, but one hour to raise?"
42285,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42286,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Long ere such miracles as thou"
42287,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And thine came o'er my thoughts, a thirst"
42288,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""For light was in this soul which now"
42289,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Thy looks have into passion burst."
42290,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42291,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""There's nothing bright above, below,"
42292,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""In sky--earth--ocean, that this breast"
42293,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Doth not intensely burn to know,"
42294,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And thee, thee, thee, o'er all the rest!"
42295,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42296,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Then come, oh Spirit, from behind"
42297,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""The curtains of thy radiant home,"
42298,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""If thou wouldst be as angel shrined,"
42299,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Or loved and claspt as mortal, come!"
42300,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42301,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Bring all thy dazzling wonders here,"
42302,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""That I may, waking, know and see;"
42303,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Or waft me hence to thy own sphere,"
42304,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Thy heaven or--ay, even _that_ with thee!"
42305,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42306,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Demon or God, who hold'st the book"
42307,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Of knowledge spread beneath thine eye,"
42308,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Give me, with thee, but one bright look"
42309,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Into its leaves and let me die!"
42310,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42311,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""By those ethereal wings whose way"
42312,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Lies thro' an element so fraught"
42313,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""With living Mind that as they play"
42314,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Their every movement is a thought!"
42315,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42316,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""By that bright, wreathed hair, between"
42317,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Whose sunny clusters the sweet wind"
42318,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Of Paradise so late hath been"
42319,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And left its fragrant soul behind!"
42320,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42321,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""By those impassioned eyes that melt"
42322,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Their light into the inmost heart,"
42323,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Like sunset in the waters, felt"
42324,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""As molten fire thro' every part--"
42325,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42326,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""I do implore thee, oh most bright"
42327,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And worshipt Spirit, shine but o'er"
42328,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""My waking, wondering eyes this night"
42329,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""This one blest night--I ask no more!"""
42330,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42331,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Exhausted, breathless, as she said"
42332,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"These burning words, her languid head"
42333,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Upon the altar's steps she cast,"
42334,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,As if that brain-throb were its last---
42335,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42336,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Till, startled by the breathing, nigh,"
42337,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of lips that echoed back her sigh,"
42338,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Sudden her brow again she raised;
42339,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And there, just lighted on the shrine,"
42340,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Beheld me--not as I had blazed
42341,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Around her, full of light divine,"
42342,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"In her late dreams, but softened down"
42343,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Into more mortal grace;--my crown
42344,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of flowers, too radiant for this world,"
42345,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Left hanging on yon starry steep;
42346,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"My wings shut up, like banners furled,"
42347,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,When Peace hath put their pomp to sleep;
42348,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Or like autumnal clouds that keep
42349,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Their lightnings sheathed rather than mar
42350,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The dawning hour of some young star;
42351,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And nothing left but what beseemed
42352,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The accessible, tho' glorious mate"
42353,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of mortal woman--whose eyes beamed
42354,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Back upon hers, as passionate;"
42355,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Whose ready heart brought flame for flame,"
42356,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Whose sin, whose madness was the same;"
42357,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And whose soul lost in that one hour
42358,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,For her and for her love--oh more
42359,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of heaven's light than even the power
42360,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of heaven itself could now restore!
42361,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And yet, that hour!--"
42362,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42363,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The Spirit here
42364,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Stopt in his utterance as if words
42365,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Gave way beneath the wild career
42366,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of his then rushing thoughts--like chords,"
42367,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Midway in some enthusiast's song,"
42368,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Breaking beneath a touch too strong;
42369,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,While the clenched hand upon the brow
42370,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Told how remembrance throbbed there now!
42371,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,But soon 'twas o'er--that casual blaze
42372,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,From the sunk fire of other days--
42373,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That relic of a flame whose burning
42374,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Had been too fierce to be relumed,"
42375,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Soon passt away, and the youth turning"
42376,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To his bright listeners thus resumed:--
42377,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42378,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Days, months elapsed, and, tho' what most"
42379,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"On earth I sighed for was mine, all--"
42380,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Yet--was I happy? God, thou know'st,"
42381,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Howe'er they smile and feign and boast,"
42382,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"What happiness is theirs, who fall!"
42383,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,'Twas bitterest anguish--made more keen
42384,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Even by the love, the bliss, between"
42385,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Whose throbs it came, like gleams of hell"
42386,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,In agonizing cross-light given
42387,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Athwart the glimpses, they who dwell"
42388,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,In purgatory[9] catch of heaven!
42389,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The only feeling that to me
42390,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Seemed joy--or rather my sole rest
42391,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,From aching misery--was to see
42392,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"My young, proud, blooming LILIS blest."
42393,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"She, the fair fountain of all ill"
42394,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To my lost soul--whom yet its thirst
42395,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Fervidly panted after still,"
42396,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And found the charm fresh as at first--
42397,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To see _her_ happy--to reflect
42398,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Whatever beams still round me played
42399,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of former pride, of glory wreckt,"
42400,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"On her, my Moon, whose light I made,"
42401,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And whose soul worshipt even my shade--
42402,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"This was, I own, enjoyment--this"
42403,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"My sole, last lingering glimpse of bliss."
42404,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And proud she was, fair creature!--proud,"
42405,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Beyond what even most queenly stirs
42406,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"In woman's heart, nor would have bowed"
42407,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That beautiful young brow of hers
42408,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To aught beneath the First above,"
42409,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,So high she deemed her Cherub's love!
42410,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42411,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Then too that passion hourly growing
42412,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Stronger and stronger--to which even
42413,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Her love at times gave way--of knowing
42414,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Everything strange in earth and heaven;
42415,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Not only all that, full revealed,"
42416,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The eternal ALLA loves to show,"
42417,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,But all that He hath wisely sealed
42418,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,In darkness for man _not_ to know--
42419,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Even this desire, alas! ill-starred"
42420,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And fatal as it was, I sought"
42421,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To feed each minute, and unbarred"
42422,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Such realms of wonder on her thought
42423,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,As ne'er till then had let their light
42424,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Escape on any mortal's sight!
42425,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42426,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,In the deep earth--beneath the sea--
42427,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Thro' caves of fire--thro' wilds of air--
42428,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Wherever sleeping Mystery
42429,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Had spread her curtain, we were there--"
42430,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Love still beside us as we went,"
42431,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,At home in each new element
42432,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And sure of worship everywhere!
42433,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42434,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Then first was Nature taught to lay
42435,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The wealth of all her kingdoms down
42436,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,At woman's worshipt feet and say
42437,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Bright creature, this is all thine own!"""
42438,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Then first were diamonds from the night,"
42439,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of earth's deep centre brought to light
42440,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And made to grace the conquering way
42441,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of proud young beauty with their ray.
42442,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42443,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Then too the pearl from out its shell
42444,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Unsightly, in the sunless sea,"
42445,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"(As 'twere a spirit, forced to dwell"
42446,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"In form unlovely) was set free,"
42447,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And round the neck of woman threw
42448,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,A light it lent and borrowed too.
42449,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,For never did this maid--whate'er
42450,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The ambition of the hour--forget
42451,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Her sex's pride in being fair;
42452,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Nor that adornment, tasteful, rare,"
42453,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which makes the mighty magnet, set"
42454,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"In Woman's form, more mighty yet."
42455,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Nor was there aught within the range
42456,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of my swift wing in sea or air,"
42457,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of beautiful or grand or strange,"
42458,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That, quickly as her wish could change,"
42459,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"I did not seek, with such fond care,"
42460,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That when I've seen her look above
42461,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"At some bright star admiringly,"
42462,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"I've said, ""Nay, look not there, my love,[10]"
42463,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Alas, I _can not_ give it thee!"""
42464,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42465,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,But not alone the wonders found
42466,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thro' Nature's realm--the unveiled, material,"
42467,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Visible glories, that abound"
42468,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thro' all her vast, enchanted ground--"
42469,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"But whatsoe'er unseen, ethereal,"
42470,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Dwells far away from human sense,"
42471,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Wrapt in its own intelligence--
42472,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The mystery of that Fountainhead,"
42473,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"From which all vital spirit runs,"
42474,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"All breath of Life, where'er 'tis spread"
42475,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thro' men or angels, flowers or suns--"
42476,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The workings of the Almighty Mind,"
42477,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,When first o'er Chaos he designed
42478,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The outlines of this world, and thro'"
42479,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That depth of darkness--like the bow,"
42480,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Called out of rain-clouds hue by hue[11]
42481,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Saw the grand, gradual picture grow;--"
42482,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The covenant with human kind
42483,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,By ALLA made--the chains of Fate
42484,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"He round himself and them hath twined,"
42485,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Till his high task he consummate;--
42486,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Till good from evil, love from hate,"
42487,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Shall be workt out thro' sin and pain,"
42488,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And Fate shall loose her iron chain
42489,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And all be free, be bright again!"
42490,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42491,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42492,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Such were the deep-drawn mysteries,"
42493,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And some, even more obscure, profound,"
42494,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And wildering to the mind than these,"
42495,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which--far as woman's thought could sound,"
42496,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Or a fallen, outlawed spirit reach--"
42497,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,She dared to learn and I to teach.
42498,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Till--filled with such unearthly lore,"
42499,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And mingling the pure light it brings
42500,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,With much that fancy had before
42501,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Shed in false, tinted glimmerings--"
42502,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The enthusiast girl spoke out, as one"
42503,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Inspired, among her own dark race,"
42504,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Who from their ancient shrines would run,"
42505,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Leaving their holy rites undone,"
42506,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To gaze upon her holier face.
42507,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And tho' but wild the things she spoke,"
42508,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Yet mid that play of error's smoke
42509,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Into fair shapes by fancy curled,"
42510,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Some gleams of pure religion broke--
42511,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Glimpses that have not yet awoke,"
42512,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,But startled the still dreaming world!
42513,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Oh! many a truth, remote, sublime,"
42514,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Which Heaven would from the minds of men
42515,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Have kept concealed till its own time,"
42516,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Stole out in these revealments then--
42517,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Revealments dim that have forerun,"
42518,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"By ages, the great, Sealing One![12]"
42519,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Like that imperfect dawn or light[13]
42520,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Escaping from the Zodiac's signs,"
42521,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which makes the doubtful east half bright,"
42522,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Before the real morning shines!
42523,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42524,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Thus did some moons of bliss go by--
42525,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of bliss to her who saw but love
42526,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And knowledge throughout earth and sky;
42527,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To whose enamored soul and eye
42528,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,I seemed--as is the sun on high--
42529,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The light of all below, above,"
42530,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The spirit of sea and land and air,"
42531,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Whose influence, felt everywhere,"
42532,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Spread from its centre, her own heart,"
42533,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Even to the world's extremest part;
42534,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,While thro' that world her rainless mind
42535,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Had now careered so fast and far,"
42536,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That earth itself seemed left behind
42537,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And her proud fancy unconfined
42538,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Already saw Heaven's gates ajar!
42539,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42540,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Happy enthusiast! still, oh! still"
42541,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Spite of my own heart's mortal chill,"
42542,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Spite of that double-fronted sorrow
42543,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which looks at once before and back,"
42544,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Beholds the yesterday, the morrow,"
42545,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And sees both comfortless, both black--"
42546,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Spite of all this, I could have still"
42547,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,In her delight forgot all ill;
42548,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Or if pain _would_ not be forgot,"
42549,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,At least have borne and murmured not.
42550,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"When thoughts of an offended heaven,"
42551,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of sinfulness, which I--even I,"
42552,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,While down its steep most headlong driven--
42553,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Well knew could never be forgiven,"
42554,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Came o'er me with an agony
42555,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Beyond all reach of mortal woe--
42556,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,A torture kept for those who know.
42557,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42558,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Know _every_ thing, and--worst of all--"
42559,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Know and love Virtue while they fall!
42560,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Even then her presence had the power
42561,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To soothe, to warm--nay, even to bless--"
42562,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,If ever bliss could graft its flower
42563,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,On stem so full of bitterness--
42564,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Even then her glorious smile to me
42565,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Brought warmth and radiance if not balm;
42566,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Like moonlight o'er a troubled sea.
42567,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Brightening the storm it cannot calm.
42568,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42569,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Oft too when that disheartening fear,"
42570,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which all who love, beneath yon sky,"
42571,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Feel when they gaze on what is dear--
42572,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The dreadful thought that it must die!
42573,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That desolating thought which comes
42574,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Into men's happiest hours and homes;
42575,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Whose melancholy boding flings
42576,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Death's shadow o'er the brightest things,"
42577,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Sicklies the infant's bloom and spreads
42578,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The grave beneath young lovers' heads!
42579,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"This fear, so sad to all--to me"
42580,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Most full of sadness from the thought
42581,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That I most still live on,[14] when she"
42582,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Would, like the snow that on the sea"
42583,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Fell yesterday, in vain be sought;"
42584,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That heaven to me this final seal
42585,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of all earth's sorrow would deny,"
42586,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And I eternally must feel
42587,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The death-pang without power to die!
42588,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42589,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Even this, her fond endearments--fond"
42590,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,As ever cherisht the sweet bond
42591,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,'Twixt heart and heart--could charm away;
42592,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Before her looks no clouds would stay,"
42593,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Or if they did their gloom was gone,"
42594,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Their darkness put a glory on!
42595,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"But 'tis not, 'tis not for the wrong,"
42596,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The guilty, to be happy long;"
42597,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And she too now had sunk within
42598,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The shadow of her tempter's sin,"
42599,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Too deep for even Omnipotence
42600,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To snatch the fated victim thence!
42601,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Listen and if a tear there be
42602,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Left in your hearts weep it for me.
42603,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42604,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"'Twas on the evening of a day,"
42605,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Which we in love had dreamt away;
42606,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"In that same garden, where--the pride"
42607,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of seraph splendor laid aside,"
42608,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And those wings furled, whose open light"
42609,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,For mortal gaze were else too bright--
42610,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"I first had stood before her sight,"
42611,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And found myself--oh, ecstasy,"
42612,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Which even in pain I ne'er forget--
42613,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Worshipt as only God should be,"
42614,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And loved as never man was yet!
42615,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"In that same garden where we now,"
42616,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thoughtfully side by side reclining,"
42617,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Her eyes turned upward and her brow
42618,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,With its own silent fancies shining.
42619,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42620,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,It was an evening bright and still
42621,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"As ever blusht on wave or bower,"
42622,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Smiling from heaven as if naught ill
42623,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Could happen in so sweet an hour.
42624,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Yet I remember both grew sad
42625,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"In looking at that light--even she,"
42626,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of heart so fresh and brow so glad,"
42627,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Felt the still hour's solemnity,"
42628,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And thought she saw in that repose
42629,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The death-hour not alone of light,"
42630,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,But of this whole fair world--the close
42631,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of all things beautiful and bright--
42632,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The last, grand sunset, in whose ray"
42633,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Nature herself died calm away!
42634,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42635,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"At length, as tho' some livelier thought"
42636,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Had suddenly her fancy caught,"
42637,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"She turned upon me her dark eyes,"
42638,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Dilated into that full shape
42639,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"They took in joy, reproach, surprise,"
42640,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"As 'twere to let more soul escape,"
42641,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And, playfully as on my head"
42642,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Her white hand rested, smiled and said:--"
42643,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42644,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""I had last night a dream of thee,"
42645,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Resembling those divine ones, given,"
42646,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Like preludes to sweet minstrelsy,"
42647,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Before thou camest thyself from heaven."
42648,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42649,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""The same rich wreath was on thy brow,"
42650,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Dazzling as if of starlight made;"
42651,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And these wings, lying darkly now,"
42652,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Like meteors round thee flasht and played."
42653,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42654,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Thou stoodest, all bright, as in those dreams,"
42655,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""As if just wafted from above,"
42656,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Mingling earth's warmth with heaven's beams,"
42657,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And creature to adore and love."
42658,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42659,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Sudden I felt thee draw me near"
42660,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""To thy pure heart, where, fondly placed,"
42661,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""I seemed within the atmosphere"
42662,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Of that exhaling light embraced;"
42663,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42664,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And felt methought the ethereal flame"
42665,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Pass from thy purer soul to mine;"
42666,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Till--oh, too blissful--I became,"
42667,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Like thee, all spirit, all divine!"
42668,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42669,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Say, why did dream so blest come o'er me,"
42670,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""If, now I wake, 'tis faded, gone?"
42671,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""When will my Cherub shine before me"
42672,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Thus radiant, as in heaven he shone?"
42673,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42674,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""When shall I, waking, be allowed"
42675,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""To gaze upon those perfect charms,"
42676,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And clasp thee once without a cloud,"
42677,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""A chill of earth, within these arms?"
42678,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42679,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Oh what a pride to say, this, this"
42680,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Is my own Angel--all divine,"
42681,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And pure and dazzling as he is"
42682,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And fresh from heaven--he's mine, he's mine!"
42683,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42684,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Thinkest thou, were LILIS in thy place,"
42685,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""A creature of yon lofty skies,"
42686,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""She would have hid one single grace,"
42687,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""One glory from her lover's eyes?"
42688,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42689,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""No, no--then, if thou lovest like me,"
42690,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Shine out, young Spirit in the blaze"
42691,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Of thy most proud divinity,"
42692,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Nor think thou'lt wound this mortal gaze."
42693,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42694,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Too long and oft I've looked upon"
42695,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Those ardent eyes, intense even thus--"
42696,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Too near the stars themselves have gone,"
42697,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""To fear aught grand or luminous."
42698,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42699,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Then doubt me not--oh! who can say"
42700,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""But that this dream may yet come true"
42701,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""And my blest spirit drink thy ray,"
42702,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Till it becomes all heavenly too?"

42706,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Will change my nature, and this frame"
42707,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""By the mere touch be deified!"""
42708,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42709,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thus spoke the maid, as one not used"
42710,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To be by earth or heaven refused--
42711,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,As one who knew her influence o'er
42712,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"All creatures, whatsoe'er they were,"
42713,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And tho' to heaven she could not soar,"
42714,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,At least would bring down heaven to her.
42715,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42716,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Little did she, alas! or I--"
42717,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Even I, whose soul, but halfway yet"
42718,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Immerged in sin's obscurity
42719,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Was as the earth whereon we lie,"
42720,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,O'er half whose disk the sun is set--
42721,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Little did we foresee the fate,"
42722,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The dreadful--how can it be told?
42723,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Such pain, such anguish to relate"
42724,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Is o'er again to feel, behold!"
42725,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"But, charged as 'tis, my heart must speak"
42726,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Its sorrow out or it will break!
42727,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Some dark misgivings _had_, I own,"
42728,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Past for a moment thro' my breast--
42729,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Fears of some danger, vague, unknown,"
42730,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To one, or both--something unblest"
42731,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To happen from this proud request.
42732,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42733,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,But soon these boding fancies fled;
42734,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Nor saw I aught that could forbid
42735,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,My full revealment save the dread
42736,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of that first dazzle, when, unhid,"
42737,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Such light should burst upon a lid
42738,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Ne'er tried in heaven;--and even this glare
42739,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"She might, by love's own nursing care,"
42740,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Be, like young eagles, taught to bear."
42741,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"For well I knew, the lustre shed"
42742,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"From cherub wings, when proudliest spread,"
42743,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Was in its nature lambent, pure,"
42744,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And innocent as is the light
42745,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The glow-worm hangs out to allure
42746,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Her mate to her green bower at night.
42747,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Oft had I in the mid-air swept
42748,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thro' clouds in which the lightning slept,"
42749,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"As in its lair, ready to spring,"
42750,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Yet waked it not--tho' from my wing
42751,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,A thousand sparks fell glittering!
42752,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Oft too when round me from above
42753,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The feathered snow in all its whiteness,"
42754,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Fell like the moultings of heaven's Dove,[15]--"
42755,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"So harmless, tho' so full of brightness,"
42756,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Was my brow's wreath that it would shake
42757,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,From off its flowers each downy flake
42758,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"As delicate, unmelted, fair,"
42759,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And cool as they had lighted there.
42760,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42761,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Nay even with LILIS--had I not
42762,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Around her sleep all radiant beamed,"
42763,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Hung o'er her slumbers nor forgot
42764,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To kiss her eyelids as she dreamed?
42765,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And yet at morn from that repose,"
42766,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Had she not waked, unscathed and bright,"
42767,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"As doth the pure, unconscious rose"
42768,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Tho' by the fire-fly kist all night?
42769,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42770,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thus having--as, alas! deceived"
42771,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"By my sin's blindness, I believed--"
42772,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,No cause for dread and those dark eyes
42773,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Now fixt upon me eagerly
42774,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,As tho' the unlocking of the skies
42775,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Then waited but a sign from me--
42776,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,How could I pause? how even let fall
42777,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,A word; a whisper that could stir
42778,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,In her proud heart a doubt that all
42779,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,I brought from heaven belonged to her?
42780,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Slow from her side I rose, while she"
42781,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Arose too, mutely, tremblingly,"
42782,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"But not with fear--all hope, and pride,"
42783,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"She waited for the awful boon,"
42784,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Like priestesses at eventide
42785,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Watching the rise of the full moon
42786,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Whose light, when once its orb hath shone,"
42787,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,'Twill madden them to look upon!
42788,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42789,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of all my glories, the bright crown"
42790,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Which when I last from heaven came down
42791,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Was left behind me in yon star
42792,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That shines from out those clouds afar--
42793,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Where, relic sad, 'tis treasured yet,"
42794,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The downfallen angel's coronet!--
42795,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of all my glories, this alone"
42796,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Was wanting:--but the illumined brow,"
42797,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The sun-bright locks, the eyes that now"
42798,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Had love's spell added to their own,"
42799,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And poured a light till then unknown;--
42800,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The unfolded wings that in their play
42801,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Shed sparkles bright as ALLA'S throne;
42802,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"All I could bring of heaven's array,"
42803,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of that rich panoply of charms
42804,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"A Cherub moves in, on the day"
42805,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of his best pomp, I now put on;"
42806,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And, proud that in her eyes I shone"
42807,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thus glorious, glided to her arms;"
42808,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which still (tho', at a sight so splendid,"
42809,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Her dazzled brow had instantly
42810,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Sunk on her breast), were wide extended"
42811,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To clasp the form she durst not see![16]
42812,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Great Heaven! how _could_ thy vengeance light
42813,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,So bitterly on one so bright?
42814,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"How could the hand that gave such charms,"
42815,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Blast them again in love's own arms?
42816,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Scarce had I touched her shrinking frame,"
42817,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,When--oh most horrible!--I felt
42818,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That every spark of that pure flame--
42819,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Pure, while among the stars I dwelt--"
42820,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Was now by my transgression turned
42821,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Into gross, earthly fire, which burned,"
42822,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Burned all it touched as fast as eye
42823,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Could follow the fierce, ravening flashes;"
42824,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Till there--oh God, I still ask why"
42825,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Such doom was hers?--I saw her lie
42826,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Blackening within my arms to ashes!
42827,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That brow, a glory but to see--"
42828,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Those lips whose touch was what the first
42829,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Fresh cup of immortality
42830,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Is to a new-made angel's thirst!
42831,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42832,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Those clasping arms, within whose round--"
42833,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,My heart's horizon--the whole bound
42834,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of its hope, prospect, heaven was found!"
42835,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which, even in this dread moment, fond"
42836,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"As when they first were round me cast,"
42837,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Loosed not in death the fatal bond,"
42838,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"But, burning, held me to the last!"
42839,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"All, all, that, but that morn, had seemed"
42840,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"As if Love's self there breathed and beamed,"
42841,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Now parched and black before me lay,"
42842,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Withering in agony away;
42843,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And mine, oh misery! mine the flame"
42844,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,From which this desolation came;--
42845,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"I, the curst spirit whose caress"
42846,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Had blasted all that loveliness!
42847,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42848,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,'Twas maddening!--but now hear even worse--
42849,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Had death, death only, been the curse"
42850,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,I brought upon her--had the doom
42851,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"But ended here, when her young bloom"
42852,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Lay in the dust--and did the spirit
42853,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"No part of that fell curse inherit,"
42854,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"'Twere not so dreadful--but, come near--"
42855,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Too shocking 'tis for earth to hear--
42856,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Just when her eyes in fading took
42857,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Their last, keen, agonized farewell,"
42858,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And looked in mine with--oh, that look!"
42859,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Great vengeful Power, whate'er the hell"
42860,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thou mayst to human souls assign,"
42861,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The memory of that look is mine!--
42862,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42863,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"In her last struggle, on my brow"
42864,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Her ashy lips a kiss imprest,"
42865,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,So withering!--I feel it now--
42866,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"'Twas fire--but fire, even more unblest"
42867,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Than was my own, and like that flame,"
42868,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The angels shudder but to name,"
42869,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Hell's everlasting element!
42870,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Deep, deep it pierced into my brain,"
42871,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Maddening and torturing as it went;
42872,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And here, mark here, the brand, the stain"
42873,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,It left upon my front--burnt in
42874,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,By that last kiss of love and sin--
42875,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,A brand which all the pomp and pride
42876,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of a fallen Spirit cannot hide!
42877,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42878,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"But is it thus, dread Providence--"
42879,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"_Can_ it indeed be thus, that she"
42880,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Who, (but for _one_ proud, fond offence,)"
42881,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Had honored heaven itself, should be"
42882,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Now doomed--I cannot speak it--no,"
42883,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Merciful ALLA! _'tis_ not so--
42884,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Never could lips divine have said
42885,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The fiat of a fate so dread.
42886,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And yet, that look--so deeply fraught"
42887,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"With more than anguish, with despair--"
42888,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That new, fierce fire, resembling naught"
42889,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,In heaven or earth--this scorch I bear!--
42890,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Oh--for the first time that these knees
42891,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Have bent before thee since my fall,"
42892,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Great Power, if ever thy decrees"
42893,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thou couldst for prayer like mine recall,"
42894,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Pardon that spirit, and on me,"
42895,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"On me, who taught her pride to err,"
42896,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Shed out each drop of agony
42897,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Thy burning phial keeps for her!
42898,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,See too where low beside me kneel
42899,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Two other outcasts who, tho' gone"
42900,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And lost themselves, yet dare to feel"
42901,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And pray for that poor mortal one.
42902,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Alas, too well, too well they know"
42903,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The pain, the penitence, the woe"
42904,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That Passion brings upon the best,"
42905,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The wisest, and the loveliest.--"
42906,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Oh! who is to be saved, if such"
42907,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Bright, erring souls are not forgiven;"
42908,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"So loath they wander, and so much"
42909,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Their very wanderings lean towards heaven!
42910,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Again I cry. Just Power, transfer"
42911,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,That creature's sufferings all to me--
42912,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Mine, mine the guilt, the torment be,"
42913,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To save one minute's pain to her,"
42914,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Let mine last all eternity!
42915,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42916,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,He paused and to the earth bent down
42917,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,His throbbing head; while they who felt
42918,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That agony as 'twere their own,"
42919,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Those angel youths, beside him knelt,"
42920,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And in the night's still silence there,"
42921,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,While mournfully each wandering air
42922,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Played in those plumes that never more
42923,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To their lost home in heaven must soar,"
42924,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Breathed inwardly the voiceless prayer,"
42925,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Unheard by all but Mercy's ear--
42926,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And which if Mercy _did not_ hear,"
42927,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Oh, God would _not_ be what this bright"
42928,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"And glorious universe of His,"
42929,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"This world of beauty, goodness, light"
42930,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And endless love proclaims He _is_!
42931,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42932,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Not long they knelt, when from a wood"
42933,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That crowned that airy solitude,"
42934,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"They heard a low, uncertain sound,"
42935,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"As from a lute, that just had found"
42936,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Some happy theme and murmured round
42937,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The new-born fancy, with fond tone,"
42938,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Scarce thinking aught so sweet its own!
42939,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Till soon a voice, that matched as well"
42940,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That gentle instrument, as suits"
42941,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The sea-air to an ocean-shell,"
42942,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"(So kin its spirit to the lute's),"
42943,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Tremblingly followed the soft strain,"
42944,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Interpreting its joy, its pain,"
42945,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And lending the light wings of words
42946,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,To many a thought that else had lain
42947,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Unfledged and mute among the chords.
42948,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42949,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,All started at the sound--but chief
42950,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The third young Angel in whose face,"
42951,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Tho' faded like the others, grief"
42952,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Had left a gentler, holier trace;"
42953,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"As if, even yet, thro' pain and ill,"
42954,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Hope had not fled him--as if still
42955,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Her precious pearl in sorrow's cup
42956,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Unmelted at the bottom lay,"
42957,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To shine again, when, all drunk up,"
42958,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The bitterness should pass away.
42959,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Chiefly did he, tho' in his eyes"
42960,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"There shone more pleasure than surprise,"
42961,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Turn to the wood from whence that sound
42962,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Of solitary sweetness broke;
42963,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Then, listening, look delighted round"
42964,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"To his bright peers, while thus it spoke:--"
42965,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Come, pray with me, my seraph love,"
42966,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""My angel-lord, come pray with me:"
42967,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""In vain to-night my lips hath strove"
42968,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""To send one holy prayer above--"
42969,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""The knee may bend, the lip may move,"
42970,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""But pray I cannot, without thee!"
42971,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""I've fed the altar in my bower"
42972,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""With droppings from the incense tree;"
42973,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""I've sheltered it from wind and shower,"
42974,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""But dim it burns the livelong hour,"
42975,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""As if, like me, it had no power"
42976,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Of life or lustre without thee!"
42977,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42978,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""A boat at midnight sent alone"
42979,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""To drift upon the moonless sea,"
42980,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""A lute, whose leading chord is gone,"
42981,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""A wounded bird that hath but one"

42985,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Then ne'er, my spirit-love, divide,"
42986,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""In life or death, thyself from me;"
42987,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""But when again in sunny pride"
42988,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Thou walk'st thro' Eden, let me glide,"
42989,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""A prostrate shadow, by thy side--"
42990,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Oh happier thus than without thee!"""
42991,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
42992,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,The song had ceased when from the wood
42993,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which sweeping down that airy height,"
42994,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Reached the lone spot whereon they stood--
42995,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,There suddenly shone out a light
42996,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"From a clear lamp, which, as it blazed"
42997,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Across the brow of one, who raised"
42998,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Its flame aloft (as if to throw
42999,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The light upon that group below),"
43000,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Displayed two eyes sparkling between
43001,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The dusky leaves, such as are seen"
43002,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"By fancy only, in those faces,"
43003,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"That haunt a poet's walk at even,"
43004,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Looking from out their leafy places
43005,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Upon his dreams of love and heaven.
43006,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,'Twas but a moment--the blush brought
43007,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,O'er all her features at the thought
43008,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of being seen thus, late, alone,"
43009,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"By any but the eyes she sought,"
43010,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Had scarcely for an instant shore
43011,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Thro' the dark leaves when she was gone--
43012,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Gone, like a meteor that o'erhead"
43013,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Suddenly shines, and, ere we've said,"
43014,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""Behold, how beautiful!""--'tis fled,"
43015,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Yet ere she went the words, ""I come,"
43016,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"""I come, my NAMA,"" reached her ear,"
43017,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"In that kind voice, familiar, dear,"
43018,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Which tells of confidence, of home,--"
43019,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of habit, that hath drawn hearts near,"
43020,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Till they grow _one_,--of faith sincere,"
43021,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And all that Love most loves to hear;
43022,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"A music breathing of the past,"
43023,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The present and the time to be,"
43024,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Where Hope and Memory to the last
43025,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Lengthen out life's true harmony!
43026,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
43027,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Nor long did he whom call so kind
43028,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Summoned away remain behind:
43029,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Nor did there need much time to tell
43030,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,What they--alas! more fallen than he
43031,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"From happiness and heaven--knew well,"
43032,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,His gentler love's short history!
43033,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,
43034,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,Thus did it run--_not_ as he told
43035,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"The tale himself, but as 'tis graved"
43036,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"Upon the tablets that, of old,"
43037,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,"By SETH[17] were from the deluge saved,"
43038,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,All written over with sublime
43039,SECOND ANGEL'S STORY.,And saddening legends of the unblest

43050,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Unclouded centre sweeping wide,"
43051,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Carry its beams on every side--
43052,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Like spheres of air that waft around
43053,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,The undulations of rich sound--
43054,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,
43055,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Till the far-circling radiance be
43056,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Diffused into infinity!
43057,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,First and immediate near the Throne
43058,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of ALLA, as if most his own,"

43065,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,
43066,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,'Mong these was ZARAPH once--and none

43069,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"With half such longing, deep desire."
43070,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Love was to his impassioned soul
43071,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Not as with others a mere part

43074,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,
43075,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Oft, when from ALLA'S lifted brow"
43076,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"A lustre came, too bright to bear,"

43078,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,To shade their dazzled sight nor dare
43079,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,To look upon the effulgence there--
43080,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,This Spirit's eyes would court the blaze
43081,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"(Such pride he in adoring took),"
43082,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,
43083,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,And rather lose in that one gaze
43084,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,The power of looking than _not_ look!
43085,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Then too when angel voices sung
43086,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,The mercy of their God and strung
43087,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Their harps to hail with welcome sweet
43088,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"That moment, watched for by all eyes,"
43089,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,When some repentant sinner's feet
43090,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"First touched the threshold of the skies,"
43091,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Oh! then how clearly did the voice
43092,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Of ZARAPH above all rejoice!
43093,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Love was in every buoyant tone--
43094,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Such love as only could belong
43095,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,To the blest angels and alone
43096,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Could, even from angels, bring such song!"
43097,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Alas! that it should e'er have been
43098,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"In heaven as 'tis too often here,"
43099,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Where nothing fond or bright is seen,"
43100,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,But it hath pain and peril near;--
43101,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Where right and wrong so close resemble,"
43102,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,That what we take for virtue's thrill
43103,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Is often the first downward tremble
43104,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Of the heart's balance unto ill;
43105,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Where Love hath not a shrine so pure,"

43107,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"In moments, even the most secure,"
43108,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Beneath his altar may glide in!
43109,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,
43110,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,So was it with that Angel--such
43111,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"The charm, that sloped his fall along,"
43112,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"From good to ill, from loving much,"
43113,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Too easy lapse, to loving wrong.--"
43114,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Even so that amorous Spirit, bound"
43115,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"By beauty's spell where'er 'twas found,"
43116,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,From the bright things above the moon
43117,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Down to earth's beaming eyes descended,"
43118,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Till love for the Creator soon
43119,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,In passion for the creature ended.
43120,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,
43121,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"'Twas first at twilight, on the shore"

43125,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"As loath, by even a breath, to stay"
43126,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,The pilgrimage of that sweet lay;
43127,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Whose echoes still went on and on,"
43128,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Till lost among the light that shone
43129,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Far off beyond the ocean's brim--
43130,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,There where the rich cascade of day
43131,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Had o'er the horizon's golden rim,"
43132,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Into Elysium rolled away!
43133,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Of God she sung and of the mild
43134,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Attendant Mercy that beside
43135,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"His awful throne for ever smiled,"
43136,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Ready with her white hand to guide
43137,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,His bolts of vengeance to their prey--
43138,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,That she might quench them on the way!
43139,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of Peace--of that Atoning Love,"
43140,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Upon whose star, shining above"
43141,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"This twilight world of hope and fear,"
43142,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,The weeping eyes of Faith are fixt
43143,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,So fond that with her every tear
43144,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,The light of that love-star is mixt!--
43145,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"All this she sung, and such a soul"
43146,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Of piety was in that song
43147,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,That the charmed Angel as it stole
43148,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Tenderly to his ear, along"
43149,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Those lulling waters where he lay,"
43150,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Watching the daylight's dying ray,"
43151,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Thought 'twas a voice from out the wave,"
43152,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"An echo, that some sea-nymph gave"
43153,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"To Eden's distant harmony,"
43154,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Heard faint and sweet beneath the sea!
43155,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,
43156,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Quickly, however, to its source,"
43157,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Tracking that music's melting course,"
43158,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,He saw upon the golden sands
43159,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of the sea-shore a maiden stand,"
43160,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Before whose feet the expiring waves
43161,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Flung their last offering with a sigh--
43162,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"As, in the East, exhausted slaves"
43163,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Lay down the far-brought gift and die--
43164,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,And while her lute hung by her hushed
43165,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,As if unequal to the tide
43166,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of song that from her lips still gushed,"
43167,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"She raised, like one beatified,"
43168,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Those eyes whose light seemed rather given
43169,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,To be adored than to adore--
43170,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Such eyes as may have lookt _from_ heaven

43175,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"The only blessings, since the fall"
43176,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Of our weak souls, that still recall"
43177,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"A trace of their high, glorious birth--"

43179,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"How Love tho' unto earth so prone,"
43180,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Delights to take Religion's wing,"
43181,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,When time or grief hath stained his own!
43182,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,How near to Love's beguiling brink

43184,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"While Music, Music is the link"
43185,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"They _both_ still hold by to the skies,"

43187,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Which they had else forgotten here.
43188,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,
43189,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,How then could ZARAPH fail to feel
43190,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"That moment's witcheries?--one, so fair,"
43191,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Breathing out music, that might steal"
43192,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Heaven from itself, and rapt in prayer"

43194,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Oh, he _did_ feel it, all too well--"
43195,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"With warmth, that far too dearly cost--"

43198,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Love, Music, or Devotion, most"
43199,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,His soul in that sweet hour was lost.
43200,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,
43201,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Sweet was the hour, tho' dearly won,"
43202,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"And pure, as aught of earth could be,"
43203,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,For then first did the glorious sun
43204,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Before religion's altar see
43205,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Two hearts in wedlock's golden tie
43206,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Self-pledged, in love to live and die."
43207,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Blest union! by that Angel wove,"
43208,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,And worthy from such hands to come;
43209,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Safe, sole, asylum, in which Love,"
43210,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"When fallen or exiled from above,"
43211,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,In this dark world can find a home.
43212,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,
43213,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"And, tho' the Spirit had transgrest,"

43215,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Won down by woman's smile, allow'd"
43216,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Terrestrial passion to breathe o'er
43217,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"The mirror of his heart, and cloud"
43218,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,God's image there so bright before--
43219,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Yet never did that Power look down
43220,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,On error with a brow so mild;
43221,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"Never did Justice wear a frown,"
43222,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,Thro' which so gently Mercy smiled.

43384,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"[6] A belief that the stars are either spirits or the vehicles of spirits,"
43385,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,was common to all the religions and heresies of the East. Kircher has
43386,THIRD ANGEL'S STORY.,"given the names and stations of the seven archangels, who were by the"

44786,EXTRACT XIV.,Proclaimed the first enchantments nigh;[1]

44827,EXTRACT XIV.,Strange learned figures with his wand;

44829,EXTRACT XIV.,"His little page behind him bore,"

44832,EXTRACT XIV.,
44833,EXTRACT XIV.,"Meanwhile his potent spells went on,"
44834,EXTRACT XIV.,And forms and faces that from out
44835,EXTRACT XIV.,A depth of shadow mildly shone

44837,EXTRACT XIV.,"Tho' thick as midnight stars they beamed,"

44843,EXTRACT XIV.,"To the long, fawn-like mouth, and chin,"
44844,EXTRACT XIV.,"Lovelily tapering, less and less,"
44845,EXTRACT XIV.,"Till by this very charm's excess,"
44846,EXTRACT XIV.,"Like virtue on the verge of sin,"
44847,EXTRACT XIV.,It touched the bounds of ugliness.
44848,EXTRACT XIV.,Here lookt as when they lived the shades

44854,EXTRACT XIV.,Nor find in all his pallet's dyes

44856,EXTRACT XIV.,"Here float two spirit shapes,[8] the one,"
44857,EXTRACT XIV.,With her white fingers to the sun
44858,EXTRACT XIV.,Outspread as if to ask his ray
44859,EXTRACT XIV.,Whether it e'er had chanced to play
44860,EXTRACT XIV.,On lilies half so fair as they!
44861,EXTRACT XIV.,This self-pleased nymph was Vanity--
44862,EXTRACT XIV.,"And by her side another smiled,"
44863,EXTRACT XIV.,"In form as beautiful as she,"
44864,EXTRACT XIV.,"But with that air subdued and mild,"
44865,EXTRACT XIV.,"That still reserve of purity,"
44866,EXTRACT XIV.,Which is to beauty like the haze
44867,EXTRACT XIV.,"Of evening to some sunny view,"
44868,EXTRACT XIV.,Softening such charms as it displays
44869,EXTRACT XIV.,"And veiling others in that hue,"

44871,EXTRACT XIV.,"This phantom nymph, who could she be,"
44872,EXTRACT XIV.,"But the bright Spirit, Modesty?"
44873,EXTRACT XIV.,
44874,EXTRACT XIV.,Long did the learned enchanter stay

44877,EXTRACT XIV.,"Group after group in close array,"
44878,EXTRACT XIV.,"Each fairer, grander, than the last."

44918,EXTRACT XIV.,Scattered its gentlest glories all--
44919,EXTRACT XIV.,As when the baffling winds blow off

45255,PREFACE.,
45256,PREFACE.,"The practice which has been lately introduced into literature, of writing"
45257,PREFACE.,"very long notes upon very indifferent verses, appears to me a rather happy"
45258,PREFACE.,"invention, as it supplies us with a mode of turning dull poetry to"
45259,PREFACE.,account; and as horses too heavy for the saddle may yet serve well enough
45260,PREFACE.,"to draw lumber, so Poems of this kind make excellent beasts of burden and"
45261,PREFACE.,"will bear notes though they may not bear reading. Besides, the comments in"
45262,PREFACE.,such cases are so little under the necessity of paying any servile
45263,PREFACE.,"deference to the text, that they may even adopt that Socratic, ""_quod"
45264,PREFACE.,"supra nos nihil ad nos.""_"
45265,PREFACE.,
45266,PREFACE.,"In the first of the two following Poems, I have ventured to speak of the"
45267,PREFACE.,"Revolution of 1688, in language which has sometimes been employed by Tory"
45268,PREFACE.,writers and which is therefore neither very new nor popular. But however
45269,PREFACE.,an Englishman might be reproached with ingratitude for depreciating the
45270,PREFACE.,merits and results of a measure which he is taught to regard as the source
45271,PREFACE.,of his liberties--however ungrateful it might appear in Alderman Birch to
45272,PREFACE.,question for a moment the purity of that glorious era to which he is
45273,PREFACE.,indebted for the seasoning of so many orations--yet an Irishman who has
45274,PREFACE.,"none of these obligations to acknowledge, to whose country the Revolution"
45275,PREFACE.,"brought nothing but injury and insult, and who recollects that the book of"
45276,PREFACE.,Molyneux was burned by order of William's Whig Parliament for daring to
45277,PREFACE.,extend to unfortunate Ireland those principles on which the Revolution was
45278,PREFACE.,professedly founded--an Irishman _may_ be allowed to criticise freely the
45279,PREFACE.,measures of that period without exposing himself either to the imputation
45280,PREFACE.,of ingratitude or to the suspicion of being influenced by any Popish
45281,PREFACE.,"remains of Jacobitism. No nation, it is true, was ever blessed with a more"
45282,PREFACE.,golden opportunity of establishing and securing its liberties for ever
45283,PREFACE.,than the conjuncture of Eighty-eight presented to the people of Great
45284,PREFACE.,Britain. But the disgraceful reigns of Charles and James had weakened and
45285,PREFACE.,degraded the national character. The bold notions of popular right which
45286,PREFACE.,had arisen out of the struggles between Charles the First and his
45287,PREFACE.,Parliament were gradually supplanted by those slavish doctrines for which
45288,PREFACE.,"Lord Hawkesbury eulogizes the churchmen of that period, and as the"
45289,PREFACE.,"Reformation had happened too soon for the purity of religion, so the"
45290,PREFACE.,Revolution came too late for the spirit of liberty. Its advantages
45291,PREFACE.,"accordingly were for the most part specious and transitory, while the"
45292,PREFACE.,evils which it entailed are still felt and still increasing. By rendering
45293,PREFACE.,"unnecessary the frequent exercise of Prerogative,--that unwieldy power"
45294,PREFACE.,"which cannot move a step without alarm,--it diminished the only"
45295,PREFACE.,"interference of the Crown, which is singly and independently exposed"
45296,PREFACE.,"before the people, and whose abuses therefore are obvious to their senses"
45297,PREFACE.,and capabilities.  Like the myrtle over a celebrated statue in Minerva's
45298,PREFACE.,"temple at Athens, it skilfully veiled from the public eye the only"
45299,PREFACE.,"obtrusive feature of royalty. At the same time, however, that the"
45300,PREFACE.,"Revolution abridged this unpopular attribute, it amply compensated by the"
45301,PREFACE.,"substitution of a new power, as much more potent in its effect as it is"
45302,PREFACE.,more secret in its operations. In the disposal of an immense revenue and
45303,PREFACE.,"the extensive patronage annexed to it, the first foundations of this power"
45304,PREFACE.,of the Crown were laid; the innovation of a standing army at once
45305,PREFACE.,"increased and strengthened it, and the few slight barriers which the Act"
45306,PREFACE.,of Settlement opposed to its progress have all been gradually removed
45307,PREFACE.,during the Whiggish reigns that succeeded; till at length this spirit of
45308,PREFACE.,"influence has become the vital principle of the state,--an agency, subtle"
45309,PREFACE.,"and unseen, which pervades every part of the Constitution, lurks under all"
45310,PREFACE.,"its forms and regulates all its movements, and, like the invisible sylph"
45311,PREFACE.,"or grace which presides over the motions of beauty,"
45312,PREFACE.,
45313,PREFACE.,"""_illam, quicquid agit, quoquo westigia flectit,"
45314,PREFACE.,"componit furlim subsequiturque.""_"
45315,PREFACE.,
45316,PREFACE.,The cause of Liberty and the Revolution are so habitually associated in
45317,PREFACE.,the minds of Englishmen that probably in objecting to the latter I may be
45318,PREFACE.,thought hostile or indifferent to the former. But assuredly nothing could
45319,PREFACE.,be more unjust than such a suspicion. The very object indeed which my
45320,PREFACE.,humble animadversions would attain is that in the crisis to which I think
45321,PREFACE.,"England is now hastening, and between which and foreign subjugation she"
45322,PREFACE.,"may soon be compelled to choose, the errors and omissions of 1688 should"
45323,PREFACE.,"be remedied; and, as it was then her fate to experience a Revolution"
45324,PREFACE.,"without Reform, so she may now endeavor to accomplish a Reform without"
45325,PREFACE.,Revolution.
45326,PREFACE.,
45327,PREFACE.,"In speaking of the parties which have so long agitated England, it will be"
45328,PREFACE.,observed that I lean as little to the Whigs as to their adversaries. Both
45329,PREFACE.,factions have been equally cruel to Ireland and perhaps equally insincere
45330,PREFACE.,in their efforts for the liberties of England. There is one name indeed
45331,PREFACE.,"connected with Whiggism, of which I can never think but with veneration"
45332,PREFACE.,"and tenderness. As justly, however, might the light of the sun be claimed"
45333,PREFACE.,by any particular nation as the sanction of that name be monopolized by
45334,PREFACE.,any party whatsoever. Mr. Fox belonged to mankind and they have lost in
45335,PREFACE.,him their ablest friend.
45336,PREFACE.,
45337,PREFACE.,"With respect to the few lines upon Intolerance, which I have subjoined,"
45338,PREFACE.,they are but the imperfect beginning of a long series of Essays with which
45339,PREFACE.,I here menace my readers upon the same important subject. I shall look to
45340,PREFACE.,no higher merit in the task than that of giving a new form to claims and
45341,PREFACE.,remonstrances which have often been much more eloquently urged and which
45342,PREFACE.,"would long ere now have produced their effect, but that the minds of some"
45343,PREFACE.,"of our statesmen, like the pupil of the human eye, contract themselves the"
45344,PREFACE.,"more, the stronger light is shed upon them."

45599,AN EPISTLE.,"[4] Tacitus has expressed his opinion, in a passage very frequently"
45600,AN EPISTLE.,"quoted, that such a distribution of power as the theory of the British"
45601,AN EPISTLE.,"constitution exhibits is merely a subject of bright speculation, ""a system"
45602,AN EPISTLE.,"more easily praised than practised, and which, even could it happen to"
45603,AN EPISTLE.,"exist, would certainly not prove permanent;"" and, in truth, a review of"
45604,AN EPISTLE.,England's annals would dispose us to agree with the great historian's
45605,AN EPISTLE.,remark. For we find that at no period whatever has this balance of the
45606,AN EPISTLE.,three estates existed; that the nobles predominated till the policy of
45607,AN EPISTLE.,"Henry VII, and his successor reduced their weight by breaking up the"
45608,AN EPISTLE.,feudal system of property; that the power of the Crown became then supreme
45609,AN EPISTLE.,"and absolute, till the bold encroachments of the Commons subverted the"
45610,AN EPISTLE.,fabric altogether; that the alternate ascendency of prerogative and
45611,AN EPISTLE.,privilege distracted the period which followed the Restoration; and that
45612,AN EPISTLE.,"lastly, the Acts of 1688, by laying the foundation of an unbounded court-"
45613,AN EPISTLE.,"influence, have secured a preponderance to the Throne, which every"
45614,AN EPISTLE.,succeeding year increases. So that the vaunted British constitution has
45615,AN EPISTLE.,never perhaps existed but in mere theory.
45616,AN EPISTLE.,
45617,AN EPISTLE.,[5] The last great wound given to the feudal system was the Act of the
45618,AN EPISTLE.,"12th of Charles II, which abolished the tenure of knight's service _in"
45619,AN EPISTLE.,"capite_, and which Blackstone compares, for its salutary influence upon"
45620,AN EPISTLE.,"property, to the boasted provisions of Magna Charta itself. Yet even in"
45621,AN EPISTLE.,this act we see the effects of that counteracting spirit which has
45622,AN EPISTLE.,contrived to weaken every effort of the English nation towards liberty.

45631,AN EPISTLE.,instead of profiting by that useful subserviency which has always
45632,AN EPISTLE.,"distinguished the ministers of our religious establishment, were so"
45633,AN EPISTLE.,infatuated as to plan the ruin of this best bulwark of their power and
45634,AN EPISTLE.,moreover connected their designs upon the Church so undisguisedly with
45635,AN EPISTLE.,their attacks upon the Constitution that they identified in the minds of
45636,AN EPISTLE.,the people the interests of their religion and their liberties. During

45855,PREFACE.,
45856,PREFACE.,The Sceptical Philosophy of the Ancients has been no less misrepresented
45857,PREFACE.,than the Epicurean. Pyrrho may perhaps have carried it to rather an
45858,PREFACE.,irrational excess;--but we must not believe with Beattie all the
45859,PREFACE.,absurdities imputed to this philosopher; and it appears to me that the
45860,PREFACE.,"doctrines of the school, as explained by Sextus Empiricus, are far more"
45861,PREFACE.,suited to the wants and infirmities of human reason as well as more
45862,PREFACE.,"conducive to the mild virtues of humility and patience, than any of those"
45863,PREFACE.,systems of philosophy which preceded the introduction of Christianity. The
45864,PREFACE.,Sceptics may be said to have held a middle path between the Dogmatists and
45865,PREFACE.,Academicians; the former of whom boasted that they had attained the truth
45866,PREFACE.,while the latter denied that any attainable truth existed. The Sceptics
45867,PREFACE.,"however, without either asserting or denying its existence, professed to"
45868,PREFACE.,"be modestly and anxiously in search of it; or, as St. Augustine expresses"
45869,PREFACE.,"it, in his liberal tract against the Manichaeans, ""_nemo nostrum dicat jam"
45870,PREFACE.,"se invenisse veritatem; sic eam quoeramus quasi ab utrisque nesciatur_."""
45871,PREFACE.,From this habit of impartial investigation and the necessity which it
45872,PREFACE.,imposed upon them of studying not only every system of philosophy but
45873,PREFACE.,"every art and science which professed to lay its basis in truth, they"
45874,PREFACE.,necessarily took a wider range of erudition and were far more travelled in
45875,PREFACE.,the regions of philosophy than those whom conviction or bigotry had
45876,PREFACE.,domesticated in any particular system. It required all the learning of
45877,PREFACE.,dogmatism to overthrow the dogmatism of learning; and the Sceptics may be
45878,PREFACE.,said to resemble in this respect that ancient incendiary who stole from
45879,PREFACE.,the altar the fire with which he destroyed the temple. This advantage over
45880,PREFACE.,"all the other sects is allowed to them even by Lipsius, whose treatise on"
45881,PREFACE.,the miracles of the Virgo Hallensis will sufficiently save him from all
45882,PREFACE.,"suspicion of scepticism. ""_labore, ingenio, memoria_,"" he says, ""_supra"

45888,PREFACE.,
45889,PREFACE.,Between the scepticism of the ancients and the moderns the great
45890,PREFACE.,"difference is that the former doubted for the purpose of investigating, as"
45891,PREFACE.,"may be exemplified by the third book of Aristotle's Metaphysics, while the"
45892,PREFACE.,"latter investigate for the purpose of doubting, as may be seen through"
45893,PREFACE.,most of the philosophical works of Hume. Indeed the Pyrrhonism of latter
45894,PREFACE.,"days is not only more subtle than that of antiquity, but, it must be"
45895,PREFACE.,"confessed, more dangerous in its tendency. The happiness of a Christian"
45896,PREFACE.,"depends so essentially upon his belief, that it is but natural he should"
45897,PREFACE.,"feel alarm at the progress of doubt, lest it should steal by degrees into"
45898,PREFACE.,"that region from which he is most interested in excluding it, and poison"
45899,PREFACE.,at last the very spring of his consolation and hope. Still however the
45900,PREFACE.,abuses of doubting ought not to deter a philosophical mind from indulging
45901,PREFACE.,mildly and rationally in its use; and there is nothing surely more
45902,PREFACE.,consistent with the meek spirit of Christianity than that humble
45903,PREFACE.,scepticism which professes not to extend its distrust beyond the circle of
45904,PREFACE.,human pursuits and the pretensions of human knowledge. A follower of this
45905,PREFACE.,school may be among the readiest to admit the claims of a superintending
45906,PREFACE.,Intelligence upon his faith and adoration: it is only to the wisdom of
45907,PREFACE.,this weak world that he refuses or at least delays his assent;--it is only
45908,PREFACE.,in passing through the shadow of earth that his mind undergoes the eclipse
45909,PREFACE.,of scepticism. No follower of Pyrrho has ever spoken more strongly against
45910,PREFACE.,"the dogmatists than St. Paul himself, in the First Epistle to the"
45911,PREFACE.,Corinthians; and there are passages in Ecclesiastes and other parts of
45912,PREFACE.,"Scripture, which justify our utmost diffidence in all that human reason"
45913,PREFACE.,originates. Even the Sceptics of antiquity refrained carefully from the
45914,PREFACE.,"mysteries of theology, and in entering the temples of religion laid aside"
45915,PREFACE.,their philosophy at the porch. Sextus Empiricus declares the acquiescence
45916,PREFACE.,of his sect in the general belief of a divine and foreknowing Power:--In
45917,PREFACE.,short it appears to me that this rational and well-regulated scepticism is
45918,PREFACE.,the only daughter of the Schools that can safely be selected as a handmaid
45919,PREFACE.,for Piety. He who distrusts the light of reason will be the first to
45920,PREFACE.,follow a more luminous guide; and if with an ardent love for truth he has
45921,PREFACE.,"sought her in vain through the ways of this life, he will but turn with"
45922,PREFACE.,"the more hope to that better world where all is simple, true and"
45923,PREFACE.,everlasting: for there is no parallax at the zenith;--it is only near our
45924,PREFACE.,troubled horizon that objects deceive us into vague and erroneous
45925,PREFACE.,calculations.

46223,PREFACE.,"The Bag, from which the following Letters are selected, was dropped by a"
46224,PREFACE.,"Twopenny Postman about two months since, and picked up by an emissary of"
46225,PREFACE.,"the Society for the Suppression of Vice, who supposing it might materially"
46226,PREFACE.,"assist the private researches of that Institution, immediately took it to"
46227,PREFACE.,his employers and was rewarded handsomely for his trouble. Such a treasury
46228,PREFACE.,"of secrets was worth a whole host of informers; and, accordingly, like the"
46229,PREFACE.,"Cupids of the poet (if I may use so profane a simile) who ""fell at odds"
46230,PREFACE.,"about the sweet-bag of a bee,""[1] those venerable Suppressors almost"
46231,PREFACE.,fought with each other for the honor and delight of first ransacking the
46232,PREFACE.,"Post-Bag. Unluckily, however, it turned out upon examination that the"
46233,PREFACE.,"discoveries of profligacy which it enabled them to make, lay chiefly in"
46234,PREFACE.,those upper regions of society which their well-bred regulations forbid
46235,PREFACE.,them to molest or meddle with.--In consequence they gained but very few
46236,PREFACE.,"victims by their prize, and after lying for a week or two under Mr."
46237,PREFACE.,Hatchard's counter the Bag with its violated contents was sold for a
46238,PREFACE.,trifle to a friend of mine.
46239,PREFACE.,
46240,PREFACE.,It happened that I had been just then seized with an ambition (having
46241,PREFACE.,never tried the strength of my wing but in a Newspaper) to publish
46242,PREFACE.,"something or other in the shape of a Book; and it occurred to me that, the"
46243,PREFACE.,"present being such a letter-writing era, a few of these Twopenny-Post"
46244,PREFACE.,Epistles turned into easy verse would be as light and popular a task as I
46245,PREFACE.,"could possibly select for a commencement. I did not, however, think it"
46246,PREFACE.,prudent to give too many Letters at first and accordingly have been
46247,PREFACE.,obliged (in order to eke out a sufficient number of pages) to reprint some
46248,PREFACE.,"of those trifles, which had already appeared in the public journals. As in"
46249,PREFACE.,"the battles of ancient times, the shades of the departed were sometimes"
46250,PREFACE.,"seen among the combatants, so I thought I might manage to remedy the"
46251,PREFACE.,"thinness of my ranks, by conjuring up a few dead and forgotten ephemerons"
46252,PREFACE.,to fill them.
46253,PREFACE.,
46254,PREFACE.,Such are the motives and accidents that led to the present publication;
46255,PREFACE.,and as this is the first time my Muse has ever ventured out of the go-cart
46256,PREFACE.,"of a Newspaper, though I feel all a parent's delight at seeing little Miss"
46257,PREFACE.,"go alone, I am also not without a parent's anxiety lest an unlucky fall"
46258,PREFACE.,should be the consequence of the experiment; and I need not point out how
46259,PREFACE.,many living instances might be found of Muses that have suffered very
46260,PREFACE.,severely in their heads from taking rather too early and rashly to their
46261,PREFACE.,"feet. Besides, a Book is so very different a thing from a Newspaper!--in"
46262,PREFACE.,"the former, your doggerel without either company or shelter must stand"
46263,PREFACE.,shivering in the middle of a bleak page by itself; whereas in the latter
46264,PREFACE.,it is comfortably backed by advertisements and has sometimes even a Speech
46265,PREFACE.,"of Mr. Stephen's, or something equally warm, for a _chauffe-pieds_--so"
46266,PREFACE.,"that, in general, the very reverse of ""_laudatur et alget_"" is its"
46267,PREFACE.,destiny.
46268,PREFACE.,
46269,PREFACE.,"Ambition, however, must run some risks and I shall be very well satisfied"
46270,PREFACE.,if the reception of these few Letters should have the effect of sending me
46271,PREFACE.,to the Post-Bag for more.

47136,LETTER IV. PAGE 584.,such effect that upon her arrival at Rome she was thought worthy of being

58928,FABLE.,But so it was--a settled case--
58929,FABLE.,"Some Act of Parliament, past snugly,"
58930,FABLE.,"Had voted _them_ a beauteous race,"

58932,FABLE.,
58933,FABLE.,"As rank indeed stood high or low,"
