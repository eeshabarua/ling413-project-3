99,I.,I.
100,I.,
101,I.,"A dull little station, a man with the eye"
102,I.,Of a dreamer; a bevy of girls moving by;
103,I.,"A swift moving train and a hot Summer sun,"
104,I.,"The curtain goes up, and our play is begun."
105,I.,"The drama of passion, of sorrow, of strife,"
106,I.,Which always is billed for the theatre Life.
107,I.,"It runs on forever, from year unto year,"
108,I.,With scarcely a change when new actors appear.
109,I.,"It is old as the world is--far older in truth,"
110,I.,For the world is a crude little planet of youth.
111,I.,"And back in the eras before it was formed,"
112,I.,The passions of hearts through the Universe stormed.
113,I.,
114,I.,Maurice Somerville passed the cluster of girls
115,I.,Who twisted their ribbons and fluttered their curls
116,I.,In vain to attract him; his mind it was plain
117,I.,Was wholly intent on the incoming train.
118,I.,"That great one eyed monster puffed out its black breath,"
119,I.,"Shrieked, snorted and hissed, like a thing bent on death,"
120,I.,"Paused scarcely a moment, and then sped away,"
121,I.,And two actors more now enliven our play.
122,I.,
123,I.,"A graceful young woman with eyes like the morn,"
124,I.,"With hair like the tassels which hang from the corn,"
125,I.,"And a face that might serve as a model for Peace,"
126,I.,"Moved lightly along, smiled and bowed to Maurice,"
127,I.,Then was lost in the circle of friends waiting near.
128,I.,"A discord of shrill nasal tones smote the ear,"
129,I.,As they greeted their comrade and bore her from sight.
130,I.,(The ear oft is pained while the eye feels delight
131,I.,In the presence of women throughout our fair land:
132,I.,"God gave them the graces which win and command,"
133,I.,"But the devil, who always in mischief rejoices,"
134,I.,Slipped into their teachers and ruined their voices.)
135,I.,
136,I.,There had stepped from the train just behind Mabel Lee
137,I.,A man whose deportment bespoke him to be
138,I.,A child of good fortune.  His mien and his air
139,I.,Were those of one all unaccustomed to care.
140,I.,"His brow was not vexed with the gold seeker's worry,"
141,I.,His manner was free from the national hurry.
142,I.,"Repose marked his movements.  Yet gaze in his eye,"
143,I.,And you saw that this calm outer man was a lie;
144,I.,And you knew that deep down in the depths of his breast
145,I.,There dwelt the unmerciful imp of unrest.
146,I.,
147,I.,He held out his hand; it was clasped with a will
148,I.,In both the firm palms of Maurice Somerville.
149,I.,"""Well, Reese, my old Comrade;"" ""Ha, Roger, my boy,"""
150,I.,"They cried in a breath, and their eyes gemmed with joy"
151,I.,"(Which but for their sex had been set in a tear),"
152,I.,"As they walked arm in arm to the trap waiting near,"
153,I.,And drove down the shining shell roadway which wound
154,I.,"Through forest and meadow, in search of the Sound."
155,I.,
156,I.,_Roger:_
157,I.,
158,I.,I smell the salt water--that perfume which starts
159,I.,The blood from hot brains back to world withered hearts;
160,I.,"You may talk of the fragrance of flower filled fields,"
161,I.,"You may sing of the odors the Orient yields,"
162,I.,"You may tell of the health laden scent of the pine,"
163,I.,But give me the subtle salt breath of the brine.
164,I.,Already I feel lost emotions of youth
165,I.,Steal back to my soul in their sweetness and truth;
166,I.,"Small wonder the years leave no marks on your face,"
167,I.,Time's scythe gathers rust in this idyllic place.
168,I.,"You must feel like a child on the Great Mother's breast,"
169,I.,With the Sound like a nurse watching over your rest?
170,I.,
171,I.,_Maurice:_
172,I.,
173,I.,"There is beauty and truth in your quaint simile,"
174,I.,I love the Sound more than the broad open sea.
175,I.,"The ocean seems always stern, masculine, bold,"
176,I.,"The Sound is a woman, now warm, and now cold."
177,I.,"It rises in fury and threatens to smite,"
178,I.,Then falls at your feet with a coo of delight;
179,I.,"Capricious, seductive, first frowning, then smiling,"
180,I.,"And always, whatever its mood is, beguiling."
181,I.,"Look, now you can see it, bright beautiful blue,"
182,I.,And far in the distance there loom into view
183,I.,"The banks of Long Island, full thirty miles off;"
184,I.,A sign of wet weather to-morrow.  Don't scoff!
185,I.,We people who chum with the waves and the wind
186,I.,Know more than all wise signal bureaus combined.
187,I.,
188,I.,"But come, let us talk of yourself--for of me"
189,I.,There is little to tell which your eyes may not see.
190,I.,"Since we finished at College (eight years, is it not?)"
191,I.,I simply have dreamed away life in this spot.
192,I.,"With my dogs and my horses, a book and a pen,"
193,I.,And a week spent in town as a change now and then.
194,I.,"Fatigue for the body, disease for the mind,"
195,I.,"Are all that the city can give me, I find."
196,I.,Yet once in a while there is wisdom I hold
197,I.,"In leaving the things that are dearer than gold,--"
198,I.,Loved people and places--if only to learn
199,I.,The exquisite rapture it is to return.
200,I.,"But you, I remember, craved motion and change;"
201,I.,"You hated the usual, worshiped the strange."
202,I.,Adventure and travel I know were your theme:
203,I.,"Well, how did the real compare with the dream?"
204,I.,"You have compassed the earth since we parted at Yale,"
205,I.,"Has life grown the richer, or only grown stale?"
206,I.,
207,I.,_Roger:_
208,I.,
209,I.,"Stale, stale, my dear boy! that's the story in short,"
210,I.,"I am weary of travel, adventure and sport;"
211,I.,"At home and abroad, in all climates and lands,"
212,I.,"I have had what life gives when a full purse commands,"
213,I.,"I have chased after Pleasure, that phantom faced elf,"
214,I.,And lost the best part of my youth and myself.
215,I.,"And now, barely thirty, I'm heart sick and blue;"
216,I.,Life seems like a farce scarcely worth sitting through.
217,I.,I dread its long stretch of dissatisfied years;
218,I.,Ah! wealth is not always the boon it appears.
219,I.,And poverty lights not such ruinous fires
220,I.,"As gratified appetites, tastes and desires."
221,I.,"Fate curses, when letting us do as we please--"
222,I.,It stunts a man's soul to be cradled in ease.
223,I.,
224,I.,_Maurice:_
225,I.,
226,I.,You are right in a measure; the devil I hold
227,I.,Is oftener found in full coffers of gold
228,I.,"Than in bare, empty larders.  The soul, it is plain,"
229,I.,"Needs the conflicts of earth, needs the stress and the strain"
230,I.,"Of misfortune, to bring out its strength in this life--"
231,I.,The Soul's calisthenics are sorrow and strife.
232,I.,"But, Roger, what folly to stand in youth's prime"
233,I.,And talk like a man who could father old Time.
234,I.,"You have life all before you; the past,--let it sleep;"
235,I.,Its lessons alone are the things you should keep.
236,I.,There is virtue sometimes in our follies and sinnings;
237,I.,Right lives very often have faulty beginnings.
238,I.,"Results, and not causes, are what we should measure."
239,I.,You have learned precious truths in your search after pleasure.
240,I.,
241,I.,"You have learned that a glow worm is never a star,"
242,I.,You have learned that Peace builds not her temples afar.
243,I.,"And now, dispossessed of the spirit to roam,"
244,I.,You are finely equipped to establish a home.
245,I.,"That's the one thing you need to lend savor to life,"
246,I.,"A home, and the love of a sweet hearted wife,"
247,I.,And children to gladden the path to old age.
248,I.,
249,I.,_Roger:_
250,I.,
251,I.,Alas! from life's book I have torn out that page;
252,I.,"I have loved many times and in many a fashion,"
253,I.,Which means I know nothing at all of the passion.
254,I.,"I have scattered my heart, here and there, bit by bit,"
255,I.,'Til now there is nothing worth while left of it;
256,I.,"And, worse than all else, I have ceased to believe"
257,I.,In the virtue and truth of the daughters of Eve.
258,I.,There's tragedy for you--when man's early trust
259,I.,"In woman, experience hurls to the dust!"
260,I.,
261,I.,_Maurice:_
262,I.,
263,I.,Then you doubt your own mother?
264,I.,
265,I.,_Roger:_
266,I.,
267,I.,She passed heavenward
268,I.,"Before I remember; a saint, I have heard,"
269,I.,"While she lived; there are scores of good women to-day,"
270,I.,_Temptation has chanced not to wander their way._
271,I.,"The devil has more than his lordship can do,"
272,I.,"He can't make the rounds, so some women keep true."
273,I.,
274,I.,_Maurice:_
275,I.,
276,I.,"You think then each woman, if tempted, must fall?"
277,I.,
278,I.,_Roger:_
279,I.,
280,I.,"Yes, if tempted her way--not one way suits them all--"
281,I.,"They have tastes in their sins as they have in their clothes,"
282,I.,"The tempter, of course, has to first study those."
283,I.,"One needs to be flattered, another is bought;"
284,I.,"One yields to caresses, by frowns one is caught."
285,I.,"One wants a bold master, another a slave,"
286,I.,"With one you must jest, with another be grave."
287,I.,But swear you're a sinner whom she has reformed
288,I.,And the average feminine fortress is stormed.
289,I.,In rescuing men from abysses of sin
290,I.,She loses her head--and herself tumbles in.
291,I.,"The mind of a woman was shaped for a saint,"
292,I.,But deep in her heart lies the devil's own taint.
293,I.,"With plans for salvation her busy brain teems,"
294,I.,While her heart longs in secret to know how sin seems.
295,I.,"And if with this question unanswered she dies,"
296,I.,Temptation came not in the right sort of guise.
297,I.,"There's my estimate, Reese, of the beautiful sex;"
298,I.,"I see by your face that my words wound and vex,"
299,I.,"But remember, my boy, I'm a man of the world."
300,I.,
301,I.,_Maurice:_
302,I.,
303,I.,"Thank God, in the vortex I have not been hurled."
304,I.,"If experience breeds such a mental disease,"
305,I.,"I am glad I have lived with the birds and the bees,"
306,I.,"And the winds and the waves, and let people alone"
307,I.,So far in my life but good women I've known.
308,I.,"My mother, my sister, a few valued friends--"
309,I.,"A teacher, a schoolmate, and there the list ends."
310,I.,"But to know one true woman in sunshine and gloom,"
311,I.,"From the zenith of life to the door of the tomb,"
312,I.,"To know her, as I knew that mother of mine,"
313,I.,Is to know the whole sex and to kneel at the shrine.
314,I.,
315,I.,_Roger:_
316,I.,
317,I.,Then you think saint and woman synonymous terms?
318,I.,
319,I.,_Maurice:_
320,I.,
321,I.,"Oh, no! we are all, men and women, poor worms"
322,I.,Crawling up from the dampness and darkness of clay
323,I.,To bask in the sunlight and warmth of the day.
324,I.,"Some climb to a leaf and reflect its bright sheen,"
325,I.,"Some toil through the grass, and are crushed there unseen."
326,I.,"Some sting if you touch them, and some evolve wings;"
327,I.,"Yet God dwells in each of the poor, groping things."
328,I.,They came from the Source--to the Source they go back;
329,I.,The sinners are those who have missed the true track.
330,I.,"We can not judge women or men as a class,"
331,I.,Each soul has its own distinct place in the mass.
332,I.,
333,I.,There is no sex in sin; it were folly to swear
334,I.,"All women are angels, but worse to declare"
335,I.,"All are devils as you do.  You're morbid, my boy,"
336,I.,In what you thought gold you have found much alloy
337,I.,And now you are doubting there is the true ore.
338,I.,But wait till you study my sweet simple store
339,I.,Of pure sterling treasures; just wait till you've been
340,I.,"A few restful weeks, or a season, within"
341,I.,"The charmed circle of home life; then, Roger, you'll find"
342,I.,These malarial mists clearing out of your mind.
343,I.,"As a ship cuts the fog and is caught by the breeze,"
344,I.,"And swept through the sunlight to fair, open seas,"
345,I.,So your heart will be caught and swept out to the ocean
346,I.,Of youth and youth's birthright of happy emotion.
347,I.,I'll wager my hat (it was new yesterday)
348,I.,"That you'll fall in love, too, in a serious way."
349,I.,"Our girls at Bay Bend are bewitching and fair,"
350,I.,And Cupid lurks ever in salt Summer air.
351,I.,
352,I.,_Roger:_
353,I.,
354,I.,"I question your gifts as a prophet, and yet,"
355,I.,I confess in my travels I never have met
356,I.,"A woman whose face so impressed me at sight,"
357,I.,"As one seen to-day; a mere girl, sweet and bright,"
358,I.,Who entered the train quite alone and sat down
359,I.,Surrounded by parcels she'd purchased in town.
360,I.,"A trim country lass, but endowed with the beauty"
361,I.,Which makes a man think of his conscience and duty.
362,I.,"Some women, you know, move us that way--God bless them,"
363,I.,While others rouse only a thirst to possess them
364,I.,"The face of the girl made me wish to be good,"
365,I.,I went out and smoked to escape from the mood.
366,I.,When conscience through half a man's life has been sleeping
367,I.,What folly to wake it to worry and weeping!
368,I.,
369,I.,_Maurice:_
370,I.,
371,I.,"The pessimist role is a modern day fad,"
372,I.,"But, Roger, you make a poor cynic, my lad."
373,I.,"Your heart at the core is as sound as a nut,"
374,I.,Though the wheels of your mind have dropped into the rut
375,I.,Of wrong thinking.  You need a strong hand on the lever
376,I.,"Of good common sense, and an earnest endeavor"
377,I.,To pull yourself out of the slough of despond
378,I.,Back into the highway of peace just beyond.
379,I.,"And now, here we are at Peace Castle in truth,"
380,I.,"And there stands its Chatelaine, sweet Sister Ruth,"
381,I.,"To welcome you, Roger; you'll find a new type"
382,I.,"In this old-fashioned girl, who in years scarcely ripe,"
383,I.,"And as childish in heart as she is in her looks,"
384,I.,"And without worldly learning or knowledge of books,"
385,I.,Yet in housewifely wisdom is wise as a sage.
386,I.,"She is quite out of step with the girls of her age,"
387,I.,For she has no ambition beyond the home sphere.
388,I.,"Ruth, here's Roger Montrose, my comrade of dear"
389,I.,College days.
390,I.,
391,I.,The gray eyes of the girl of nineteen
392,I.,Looked into the face oft in fancy she'd seen
393,I.,When her brother had talked of his comrade at Yale.
394,I.,"His stature was lower, his cheek was more pale"
395,I.,Than her thought had portrayed him; a look in his eye
396,I.,"Made her sorry, she knew not for what nor knew why,"
397,I.,"But she longed to befriend him, as one needing aid"
398,I.,"While he, gazing down on the face of the maid,"
399,I.,"Spoke some light words of greeting, the while his mind ran"
400,I.,"On her ""points"" good and bad; for the average man"
401,I.,When he looks at a woman proceeds first to scan her
402,I.,"As if she were horse flesh, and in the same manner"
403,I.,"Notes all that is pleasing, or otherwise.  So"
404,I.,Roger gazed at Ruth Somerville.
405,I.,
406,I.,"""Mouth like a bow"
407,I.,"And eyes full of motherhood; color too warm,"
408,I.,And too round in the cheek and too full in the form
409,I.,For the highest ideal of beauty and art.
410,I.,Domestic--that word is the cue to her part
411,I.,"She would warm a man's slippers, but never his veins;"
412,I.,"She would feed well his stomach, but never his brains."
413,I.,"And after she looks on her first baby's face,"
414,I.,Her husband will hold but a second-class place
415,I.,"In her thoughts or emotions, unless he falls ill,"
416,I.,When a dozen trained nurses her place can not fill.
417,I.,She is sweet of her kind; and her kind since the birth
418,I.,"Of this sin ridden, Circe-cursed planet, the Earth,"
419,I.,"Has kept it, I own, with its medleys of evil"
420,I.,From going straight into the hands of the devil.
421,I.,"It is not through its heroes the world lives and thrives,"
422,I.,But through its sweet commonplace mothers and wives.
423,I.,"We love them, and leave them; deceive, and respect them,"
424,I.,We laud loud their virtues and straightway neglect them.
425,I.,They are daisy and buttercup women of earth
426,I.,Who grace common ways with their sweetness and worth.
427,I.,"We praise, but we pass them, to reach for some flower"
428,I.,"That stings when we pluck it, or wilts in an hour."
429,I.,
430,I.,"""You are thornless, fair Ruth! you are useful and sweet!"
431,I.,But lovers shall pass you to sigh at the feet
432,I.,"Of the selfish and idle, for such is man's way;"
433,I.,"Your lot is to work, and to weep, and to pray."
434,I.,To give much and get little; to toil and to wait
435,I.,For the meager rewards of indifferent fate.
436,I.,"Yet so wholesome your heart, you will never complain;"
437,I.,"You will feast on life's sorrow and drink of its pain,"
438,I.,And thank God for the banquet; 'tis women like you
439,I.,Who make the romancing of preachers seem true.
440,I.,The earth is your debtor to such large amounts
441,I.,"There must be a heaven to square up accounts,"
442,I.,Or else the whole scheme of existence at best
443,I.,"Is a demon's poor effort at making a jest."""
444,I.,
445,I.,That night as Ruth brushed out her bright hazel hair
446,I.,"Her thoughts were of Roger, ""His bold laughing air"
447,I.,"Is a cloak to some sorrow concealed in his breast,"
448,I.,"His mind is the home of some secret unrest."""
449,I.,
450,I.,She sighed; and there woke in her bosom once more
451,I.,The impulse to comfort and help him; to pour
452,I.,Soothing oil from the urn of her heart on his wounds.
453,I.,Where motherhood nature in woman abounds
454,I.,"It is thus Cupid comes; unannounced and unbidden,"
455,I.,"In sweet pity's guise, with his arrows well hidden."
456,I.,"But once given welcome and housed as a guest,"
457,I.,"He hurls the whole quiver full into her breast,"
458,I.,While he pulls off his mask and laughs up in her eyes
459,I.,With an impish delight at her start of surprise.
460,I.,So intent is this archer on bagging his game
461,I.,He scruples at nothing which gives him good aim.
462,I.,
463,I.,"Ruth's heart was a virgin's, in love menaced danger"
464,I.,While she sat by her mirror and pitied the stranger.
465,I.,But just as she blew out her candle and stood
466,I.,"Robed for sleep in the moonlight, a change in her mood"
467,I.,"Quickly banished the dreamer, and brought in its stead"
468,I.,The practical housekeeper.  Sentiment fled;
469,I.,"And she puzzled her brain to decide which were best,"
470,I.,"Corn muffins or hot graham gems, for the guest!"
471,I.,
472,I.,
473,II.,II.
474,II.,
475,II.,The short-sighted minister preached at Bay Bend
476,II.,"His long-winded sermon quite through to the end,"
477,II.,Unmindful there sat in the Somerville pew
478,II.,A stranger whose pale handsome countenance drew
479,II.,All eyes from his own reverend self; nor suspected
480,II.,What Ruth and her brother too plainly detected
481,II.,That the stranger was bored.
482,II.,
483,II.,"""Though his gaze never stirred"
484,II.,"From the face of the preacher, his heart has not heard,"""
485,II.,Ruth said to herself; and her soft mother-eye
486,II.,Was fixed on his face with a look like a sigh
487,II.,"In its tremulous depths, as they rose to depart."
488,II.,"Then suddenly Roger, alert, seemed to start"
489,II.,"And his dull, listless glance changed to one of surprise"
490,II.,And of pleasure.  Ruth saw that the goal of his eyes
491,II.,Was her friend Mabel Lee in the vestibule; fair
492,II.,As a saint that is pictured with sun tangled hair
493,II.,"And orbs like the skies in October.  She smiled,"
494,II.,And the saint disappeared in the innocent child
495,II.,With an unconscious dower of beauty and youth
496,II.,She paused in the vestibule waiting for Ruth
497,II.,And seemed not to notice the warm eager gaze
498,II.,Of two men fixed upon her in different ways.
499,II.,"One, the look which souls lift to a being above,"
500,II.,The other a look of unreasoning love
501,II.,Born of fancy and destined to grow in an hour
502,II.,To a full fledged emotion of mastering power.
503,II.,
504,II.,"She spoke, and her voice disappointed the ear;"
505,II.,It lacked some deep chords that the heart hoped to hear.
506,II.,"It was sweet, but not vibrant; it came from the throat,"
507,II.,And one listened in vain for a full chested note.
508,II.,While something at times like a petulant sound
509,II.,Seemed in strange disaccord with the peace so profound
510,II.,Of the eyes and the brow.
511,II.,
512,II.,Though our sight is deceived
513,II.,The ear is an organ that may be believed.
514,II.,"The faces of people are trained to conceal,"
515,II.,But their unruly voices are prone to reveal
516,II.,"What lies deep in their natures; a voice rarely lies,"
517,II.,"But Mabel Lee's voice told one tale, while her eyes"
518,II.,"Told another.  Large, liquid, and peaceful as lakes"
519,II.,"Where the azure dawn rests, ere the loud world awakes,"
520,II.,"Were the beautiful eyes of the maiden.  ""A saint,"
521,II.,"Without mortal blemish or weak human taint,"""
522,II.,Said Maurice to himself.  To himself Roger said:
523,II.,"""The touch of her soft little hands on my head"
524,II.,Would convert me.  What peace for a world weary breast
525,II.,"To just sit by her side and be soothed into rest."""
526,II.,
527,II.,"Daring thoughts for a stranger.  Maurice, who had known"
528,II.,"Mabel Lee as a child, to himself would not own"
529,II.,Such bold longings as those were.  He held her to be
530,II.,Too sacred for even a thought that made free.
531,II.,And the voice in his bosom was silenced and hushed
532,II.,Lest the bloom from her soul by his words should be brushed.
533,II.,
534,II.,There are men to whom love is religion; but woman
535,II.,Is far better pleased with a homage more human.
536,II.,"Though she may not be able to love in like fashion,"
537,II.,She wants to be wooed with both ardor and passion.
538,II.,"Had Mabel Lee read Roger's thoughts of her, bold"
539,II.,"Though they were, they had flattered and pleased her, I hold."
540,II.,
541,II.,The stranger was duly presented.
542,II.,
543,II.,_Roger:_
544,II.,
545,II.,"Miss Lee,"
546,II.,"I am sure, has no least recollection of me,"
547,II.,But the pleasure is mine to have looked on her face
548,II.,Once before this.
549,II.,
550,II.,_Mabel:_
551,II.,
552,II.,Indeed?  May I ask where?
553,II.,
554,II.,_Roger:_
555,II.,
556,II.,The place
557,II.,"Was the train, and the time yesterday."
558,II.,
559,II.,_Mabel:_
560,II.,
561,II.,"""Then I came"
562,II.,From my shopping excursion in town by the same
563,II.,Fast express which brought you?  Had I known that the friend
564,II.,"Of my friends, was so near me en route for Bay Bend,"
565,II.,I had waived all conventions and asked him to take
566,II.,One-half of my parcels for sweet pity's sake.
567,II.,
568,II.,_Roger:_
569,II.,
570,II.,You sadden me sorely.  As long as I live
571,II.,I shall mourn the great pleasure chance chose not to give.
572,II.,
573,II.,_Maurice:_
574,II.,
575,II.,"Take courage, mon ami.  Our fair friend, Miss Lee,"
576,II.,Fills her time quite as full of sweet works as the bee;
577,II.,"Like the bee, too, she drives out the drones from her hive."
578,II.,"You must toil in her cause, in her favor to thrive."
579,II.,
580,II.,_Roger:_
581,II.,
582,II.,She need but command me.  To wait upon beauty
583,II.,And goodness combined makes a pleasure of duty.
584,II.,
585,II.,_Maurice:_
586,II.,
587,II.,Who serves Mabel Lee serves all Righteousness too.
588,II.,"Pray, then, that she gives you some labor to do."
589,II.,The cure for the pessimist lies in good deeds.
590,II.,"Who toils for another forgets his own needs,"
591,II.,And mischief and misery never attend
592,II.,On the man who is occupied fully.
593,II.,
594,II.,_Ruth:_
595,II.,
596,II.,Our friend
597,II.,Has the town on her shoulders.  Whatever may be
598,II.,"The cause that is needy, we look to Miss Lee."
599,II.,Have you gold?  She will make you disgorge it ere long;
600,II.,"Are you poor?  Well, perchance you can dance--sing a song--"
601,II.,"Make a speech--tell a story, or plan a charade."
602,II.,"Whatever you have, gold or wits, sir, must aid"
603,II.,In her numerous charities.
604,II.,
605,II.,_Mabel:_
606,II.,
607,II.,Riches and brain
608,II.,"Are but loans from the Master.  He meant them, 'tis plain,"
609,II.,"To be used in His service; and people are kind,"
610,II.,When once you can set them to thinking.  I find
611,II.,"It is lack of perception, not lack of good heart"
612,II.,Which makes the world selfish in seeming.  My part
613,II.,"Is to call the attention of Plenty to need,"
614,II.,And to bid Pleasure pause for a moment and heed
615,II.,The woes and the burdens of Labor.
616,II.,
617,II.,_Roger:_
618,II.,
619,II.,One plea
620,II.,From the rosy and eloquent lips of Miss Lee
621,II.,Would make Avarice pour out his coffers of gold
622,II.,"At her feet, I should fancy; would soften the cold,"
623,II.,"Selfish heart of the world to compassionate sighs,"
624,II.,And bring tears of pity to vain Pleasure's eyes.
625,II.,
626,II.,"As the sunset a color on lily leaves throws,"
627,II.,The words and the glances of Roger Montrose
628,II.,O'er the listener's cheeks sent a pink tinted wave;
629,II.,"While Maurice seemed disturbed, and his sister grew grave."
630,II.,The false chink of flattery's coin smites the ear
631,II.,With an unpleasant ring when the heart is sincere.
632,II.,"Yet the man whose mind pockets are filled with this ore,"
633,II.,"Though empty his brain cells, is never a bore"
634,II.,To the opposite sex.
635,II.,
636,II.,While Maurice knew of old
637,II.,Roger's wealth in that coin that does duty for gold
638,II.,"In Society dealings, it hurt him to see"
639,II.,The cheap metal offered to sweet Mabel Lee.
640,II.,
641,II.,"(Yet, perchance, the hurt came, not so much that 'twas offered,"
642,II.,"As in seeing her take, with a smile, what was proffered.)"
643,II.,"They had walked, two by two, down the elm shaded street,"
644,II.,"Which led to a cottage, vine hidden, and sweet"
645,II.,"With the breath of the roses that covered it, where"
646,II.,Mabel paused in the gateway; a picture most fair.
647,II.,"""I would ask you to enter,"" she said, ""ere you pass,"
648,II.,But in just twenty minutes my Sunday-school class
649,II.,Claims my time and attention; and later I meet
650,II.,A Committee on Plans for the boys of the street.
651,II.,We seek to devise for these pupils in crime
652,II.,Right methods of thought and wise uses of time.
653,II.,
654,II.,_Roger:_
655,II.,
656,II.,"I am but a vagrant, untutored and wild,"
657,II.,"May I join your street class, and be taught like a child?"
658,II.,
659,II.,_Mabel:_
660,II.,
661,II.,If you come I will carefully study your case.
662,II.,
663,II.,_Maurice:_
664,II.,
665,II.,"I must go along, too, just to keep him in place."
666,II.,
667,II.,_Mabel:_
668,II.,
669,II.,Then you think him unruly?
670,II.,
671,II.,_Maurice:_
672,II.,
673,II.,Decidedly so.
674,II.,
675,II.,_Roger:_
676,II.,
677,II.,"I was, but am changed since one-half hour ago."
678,II.,
679,II.,Mabel:__
680,II.,
681,II.,The change is too sudden to be of much worth;
682,II.,The deepest convictions are slowest of birth.
683,II.,"Conversion, I hold, to be earnest and lasting,"
684,II.,"Begins with repentance and praying and fasting,"
685,II.,"And (begging your pardon for such a bold speech),"
686,II.,"You seem, sir, a stranger to all and to each"
687,II.,Of these ways of salvation.
688,II.,
689,II.,_Roger:_
690,II.,
691,II.,"Since yesterday, miss,"
692,II.,"When, unseen, I first saw you (believe me in this),"
693,II.,I have deeply repented my sins of the past.
694,II.,"To-night I will pray, and to-morrow will fast--"
695,II.,"Or, make it next week, when my shore appetite"
696,II.,May be somewhat subdued in its ravenous might.
697,II.,
698,II.,_Maurice:_
699,II.,
700,II.,That's the way of the orthodox sinner!  He waits
701,II.,Until time or indulgence or misery sates
702,II.,"All his appetites, then his repentance begins,"
703,II.,"When his sins cease to please, then he gives up his sins"
704,II.,And grows pious.  Now prove you are morally brave
705,II.,By actually giving up something you crave!
706,II.,We have fricasseed chicken and strawberry cake
707,II.,For our dinner to-day.
708,II.,
709,II.,_Roger:_
710,II.,
711,II.,For dear principle's sake
712,II.,"I could easily do what you ask, were it not"
713,II.,"Most unkind to Miss Ruth, who gave labor and thought"
714,II.,"To that menu, preparing it quite to my taste."
715,II.,
716,II.,_Ruth:_
717,II.,
718,II.,"But the thought and the dinner will both go to waste,"
719,II.,"If we linger here longer; and Mabel, I see,"
720,II.,Is impatient to go to her duties.
721,II.,
722,II.,_Roger:_
723,II.,
724,II.,The bee
725,II.,Is reluctant to turn from the lily although
726,II.,The lily may obviously wish he would go
727,II.,And leave her to muse in the sunlight alone.
728,II.,"Yet when the rose calls him, his sorrow, I own,"
729,II.,Has its recompense.  So from delight to delight
730,II.,I fly with my wings honeyladen.
731,II.,Good night.
732,II.,
733,II.,
734,II.,
735,II.,
736,II.,"_Oh, love is like the dawnlight"
737,II.,"That turns the dark to day,"
738,II.,And love is like the deep night
739,II.,With secrets hid away._
740,II.,
741,II.,_And love is like the moonlight
742,II.,"Where tropic Summers glow,"
743,II.,And love is like the twilight
744,II.,When dreams begin to grow._
745,II.,
746,II.,"_Oh, love is like the sunlight"
747,II.,That sets the world ablaze.
748,II.,And love is like the moonlight
749,II.,With soft illusive rays._
750,II.,
751,II.,_And love is like the starlight
752,II.,That glimmers o'er the skies.
753,II.,And love is like the far light
754,II.,That shines from God's great eyes._

756,II.,
757,II.,
758,II.,
759,III.,III.
760,III.,
761,III.,Maurice Somerville from his turreted den
762,III.,Looked out of the window and laid down his pen.
763,III.,"A soft salty wind from the water was blowing,"
764,III.,Below in the garden sat Ruth with her sewing.
765,III.,And stretched on the grass at her feet Roger lay
766,III.,With a book in his hand.
767,III.,
768,III.,"Through the ripe August day,"
769,III.,"Piped the Katydids' voices, Jack Frost's tally-ho"
770,III.,Commanding Queen Summer to pack up and go.
771,III.,"Maurice leaned his head on the casement and sighed,"
772,III.,Strong and full in his heart surged love's turbulent tide.
773,III.,And thoughts of the woman he worshiped with longing
774,III.,Took shape and like angels about him came thronging.
775,III.,The world was all Mabel! her exquisite face
776,III.,Seemed etched on the sunlight and gave it its grace;
777,III.,"Her eyes made the blue of the heavens, the sun"
778,III.,Was her wonderful hair caught and coiled into one
779,III.,"Shining mass.  With a reverent, worshipful awe,"
780,III.,"It was Mabel, fair Mabel, dear Mabel he saw,"
781,III.,When he looked up to God.
782,III.,
783,III.,They had been much together
784,III.,"Through all the bright stretches of midsummer weather,"
785,III.,"Ruth, Roger, and Mabel and he.  Scarce a day"
786,III.,But the four were united in work or in play.
787,III.,And much of the play to a man or a maid
788,III.,"Not in love had seemed labor.  Recital, charade,"
789,III.,"Garden party, church festival, musical, hop,"
790,III.,Were all planned by Miss Lee without respite or stop.
791,III.,"The poor were the richer; school, hospital, church,"
792,III.,"The heathen, the laborer left in the lurch"
793,III.,"By misfortune, the orphan, the indigent old,"
794,III.,Our kind Lady Bountiful aided with gold
795,III.,"Which she filched from the pockets of pleasure--God's spoil,"
796,III.,And God's blessing will follow such lives when they toil
797,III.,Through an infinite sympathy.
798,III.,
799,III.,Fair Mabel Lee
800,III.,Loved to rule and to lead.  She was eager to be
801,III.,In the eyes of the public.  That modern day craze
802,III.,"Possessed her in secret, and this was its phase."
803,III.,"An innocent, even commendable, fad"
804,III.,Which filled empty larders and cheered up the sad.
805,III.,"She loved to do good.  But, alas! in her heart,"
806,III.,She loved better still the authoritative part
807,III.,Which she played in her town.
808,III.,
809,III.,'Neath the saint's aureole
810,III.,"Lurked the feminine tyrant who longed to control,"
811,III.,"And who never would serve; but her sway was so sweet,"
812,III.,That her world was contented to bow at her feet.
813,III.,
814,III.,Who toils in the great public vineyard must needs
815,III.,Let other hands keep his own garden from weeds.
816,III.,So busy was Mabel with charity fairs
817,III.,She gave little thought to her home or its cares.
818,III.,"Mrs. Lee, like the typical modern day mother,"
819,III.,Was maid to her daughter; the father and brother
820,III.,Were slaves at her bidding; an excellent plan
821,III.,To make a tyrannical wife for some man.
822,III.,
823,III.,"Yet where was the man who, beholding the grace"
824,III.,"Of that slight girlish creature, and watching her face"
825,III.,"With its infantile beauty and sweetness, would dare"
826,III.,Think aught but the rarest of virtues dwelt there?
827,III.,"Rare virtues she had, but in commonplace ones"
828,III.,Which make happy husbands and home loving sons
829,III.,She was utterly lacking.  Ruth Somerville saw
830,III.,In sorrow and silence this blemishing flaw
831,III.,In the friend whom she loved with devotion!  Maurice
832,III.,Saw only the angel with eyes full of peace.
833,III.,The faults of plain women are easily seen.
834,III.,But who cares to peer back of beauty's fair screen
835,III.,For things which are ugly to look on?
836,III.,
837,III.,The lover
838,III.,Is not quite in love when his sharp eyes discover
839,III.,The flaws in his jewel.
840,III.,
841,III.,Maurice from his room
842,III.,"Looked dreamily down on the garden of bloom,"
843,III.,Where Ruth sat with Roger; he smiled as he thought
844,III.,How quickly the world sated cynic was brought
845,III.,"Into harness by Cupid.  The man mad with drink,"
846,III.,"And the man mad with love, is quite certain to think"
847,III.,All other men drunkards or lovers.  In truth
848,III.,Maurice had expected his friend to love Ruth.
849,III.,"""She was young, she was fair; with her bright sunny art"
850,III.,She could scatter the mists from his world befogged heart.
851,III.,"She could give him the one heaven under God's dome,"
852,III.,"A peaceful, well ordered, and love-guarded home."
853,III.,And he? why of course he would worship her!  When
854,III.,Cupid finds the soft spot in the hearts of such men
855,III.,"They are ideal husbands.""  Maurice Somerville"
856,III.,Felt the whole world was shaping itself to his will.
857,III.,"And his heart stirred with joy as, by thought necromancy,"
858,III.,"He made the near future unfold to his fancy,"
859,III.,"And saw Ruth the bride of his friend, and the place"
860,III.,She left vacant supplied with the beauty and grace
861,III.,"Of this woman he longed for, the love of his life,"
862,III.,"Fair Mabel, his angel, his sweet spirit wife."
863,III.,
864,III.,Maurice to his desk turned again and once more
865,III.,Began to unburden his bosom and pour
866,III.,"His heart out on paper--the poet's relief,"
867,III.,When drunk with life's rapture or sick with its grief.
868,III.,
869,III.,
870,III.,_Song._
871,III.,
872,III.,When shall I tell my lady that I love her?
873,III.,"Will it be while the sunshine woos the world,"
874,III.,"Or when the mystic twilight bends above her,"
875,III.,Or when the day's bright banners all are furled?
876,III.,"Will wild winds shriek, or will the calm stars glow,"
877,III.,"When I shall tell her that I love her so,"
878,III.,I love her so?
879,III.,
880,III.,I think the sun should shine in all his glory;
881,III.,"Again, the twilight seems the fitting time."
882,III.,"Yet sweet dark night would understand the story,"
883,III.,"So old, so new, so tender, so sublime."
884,III.,"Wild storms should rage to chord with my desire,"
885,III.,"Yet faithful stars should shine and never tire,"
886,III.,And never tire.
887,III.,
888,III.,"Ah, if my lady will consent to listen,"
889,III.,"All hours, all times, shall hear my story told."
890,III.,"In amorous dawns, on nights when pale stars glisten"
891,III.,"In dim hushed gloamings and in noon hours bold,"
892,III.,"While thunders crash, and while the winds breathe low,"
893,III.,Will I re-tell her that I love her so.
894,III.,I love her so.
895,III.,
896,III.,
897,III.,
898,III.,
899,IV.,IV.
900,IV.,
901,IV.,The October day had been luscious and fair
902,IV.,Like a woman of thirty.  A chill in the air
903,IV.,As the sun faced the west spoke of frost lurking near.
904,IV.,"All day the Sound lay without motion, and clear"
905,IV.,"As a mirror, and blue as a blond baby's eyes."
906,IV.,A change in the tide brought a change to the skies.
907,IV.,The bay stirred and murmured and parted its lips
908,IV.,"And breathed a long sigh for the lost lovely ships,"
909,IV.,That had gone with the Summer.
910,IV.,
911,IV.,Its calm placid breast
912,IV.,Was stirred into passionate pain and unrest.
913,IV.,"Not a sail, not a sail anywhere to be seen!"
914,IV.,The soft azure eyes of the sea turned to green.
915,IV.,A sudden wind rose; like a runaway horse
916,IV.,Unchecked and unguided it sped on its course.
917,IV.,"The waves bared their teeth, and spat spray in the face"
918,IV.,Of the furious gale as they fled in the chase.
919,IV.,The sun hurried into a cloud; and the trees
920,IV.,"Bowed low and yet lower, as if to appease"
921,IV.,The wrath of the storm king that threatened them.  Close
922,IV.,To the waves at their wildest stood Roger Montrose.
923,IV.,The day had oppressed him; and now the unrest
924,IV.,"Of the wind beaten sea brought relief to his breast,"
925,IV.,Or at least brought the sense of companionship.  Lashed
926,IV.,"By his higher emotions, the man's passions dashed"
927,IV.,"On the shore of his mind in a frenzy of pain,"
928,IV.,"Like the waves on the rocks, and a frenzy as vain."
929,IV.,
930,IV.,"Since the day he first looked on her face, Mabel Lee"
931,IV.,"Had seemed to his self sated nature to be,"
932,IV.,"On life's troubled ocean, a beacon of light,"
933,IV.,To guide him safe out from the rocks and the night.
934,IV.,Her calm soothed his passion; her peace gave him poise;
935,IV.,She seemed like a silence in life's vulgar noise.
936,IV.,"He bathed in the light which her purity cast,"
937,IV.,And felt half absolved from the sins of the past.
938,IV.,He longed in her mantle of goodness to hide
939,IV.,And forget the whole world.  By the incoming tide
940,IV.,He talked with his heart as one talks with a friend
941,IV.,"Who is dying.  ""The summer has come to an end"
942,IV.,"And I wake from my dreaming,"" he mused.  ""Wake to know"
943,IV.,That my place is not here--I must go--I must go.
944,IV.,"Who dares laugh at Love shall hear Love laughing last,"
945,IV.,As forth from his bowstring barbed arrows are cast.
946,IV.,"I scoffed at the god with a sneer on my lip,"
947,IV.,And he forces me now from his chalice to sip
948,IV.,"A bitter sweet potion.  Ah, lightly the part"
949,IV.,"Of a lover I've played many times, but my heart"
950,IV.,Has been proud in its record of friendship.  And now
951,IV.,"The mad, eager lover born in me must bow"
952,IV.,To the strong claims of friendship.  I love Mabel Lee;
953,IV.,"Dared I woo as I would, I could make her love me."
954,IV.,The soul of a maid who knows not passion's fire
955,IV.,Is moth to the flame of a man's strong desire.
956,IV.,With one kiss on her lips I could banish the nun
957,IV.,And wake in her virginal bosom the one
958,IV.,"Mighty love of her life.  If I leave her, I know"
959,IV.,She will be my friend's wife in a season or so.
960,IV.,"He loves her, he always has loved her; 'tis he"
961,IV.,Who ever will do all the loving; and she
962,IV.,"Will accept it, and still be the saint to the end,"
963,IV.,And she never will know what she missed; but my friend
964,IV.,Has the right to speak first.  God! how can he delay?
965,IV.,I marvel at men who are fashioned that way.
966,IV.,"He has worshiped her since first she put up her tresses,"
967,IV.,And let down the hem of her school-girlish dresses
968,IV.,And now she is full twenty-two; were I he
969,IV.,A brood of her children should climb on my knee
970,IV.,By this time!  What a sin against love to postpone
971,IV.,The day that might make her forever his own.
972,IV.,The man who can wait has no blood in his veins.
973,IV.,"Maurice is a dreamer, he loves with his brains"
974,IV.,Not with soul and with senses.  And yet his whole life
975,IV.,Will be blank if he makes not this woman his wife.
976,IV.,"She is woof of his dreams, she is warp of his mind;"
977,IV.,Who tears her away shall leave nothing behind.
978,IV.,"No, no, I am going: farewell to Bay Bend"
979,IV.,I am no woman's lover--I _am_ one man's friend.
980,IV.,Still-born in the arms of the matron eyed year
981,IV.,Lies the beautiful dream that my life buries here.
982,IV.,"Its tomb was its cradle; it came but to taunt me,"
983,IV.,"It died, but its phantom shall ever more haunt me."""
984,IV.,
985,IV.,He turned from the waves that leaped at him in wrath
986,IV.,"To find Mabel Lee, like a wraith, in his path."
987,IV.,The rose from her cheek had departed in fear;
988,IV.,The tip of her eyelash was gemmed with a tear.
989,IV.,"The rude winds had disarranged mantle and dress,"
990,IV.,And she clung with both hands to her hat in distress.
991,IV.,"""I am frightened,"" she cried, in a tremulous tone;"
992,IV.,"""I dare not proceed any farther alone."
993,IV.,"As I came by the church yard the wind felled a tree,"
994,IV.,And invisible hands seemed to hurl it at me;
995,IV.,"I hurried on, shrieking; the wind, in disgust,"
996,IV.,"Tore the hat from my head, filled my eyes full of dust,"
997,IV.,And otherwise made me the butt of its sport.
998,IV.,"Just then I spied you, like a light in the port,"
999,IV.,And I steered for you.  Please do not laugh at my fright!
1000,IV.,"I am really quite bold in the calm and the light,"
1001,IV.,"But when a storm gathers, or darkness prevails,"
1002,IV.,"My courage deserts me, my bravery fails,"
1003,IV.,"And I want to hide somewhere and cover my ears,"
1004,IV.,"And give myself up to weak womanish tears."""
1005,IV.,
1006,IV.,Her ripple of talk allowed Roger Montrose
1007,IV.,A few needed moments to calm and compose
1008,IV.,His excited emotions; to curb and control
1009,IV.,The turbulent feelings that surged through his soul
1010,IV.,At the sudden encounter.
1011,IV.,
1012,IV.,"""I quite understand,"""
1013,IV.,He said in a voice that was under command
1014,IV.,"Of his will, ""All your fears in a storm of this kind."
1015,IV.,There is something uncanny and weird in the wind;
1016,IV.,"Intangible, viewless, it speeds on its course,"
1017,IV.,And forests and oceans must yield to its force.
1018,IV.,"What art has constructed with patience and toil,"
1019,IV.,The wind in one second of time can despoil.
1020,IV.,"It carries destruction and death and despair,"
1021,IV.,Yet no man can follow it into its lair
1022,IV.,And bind it or stay it--this thing without form.
1023,IV.,Ah! there comes the rain! we are caught in the storm.
1024,IV.,Put my coat on your shoulders and come with me where
1025,IV.,Yon rock makes a shelter--I often sit there
1026,IV.,To watch the great conflicts 'twixt tempest and sea.
1027,IV.,"Let me lie at your feet!  'Tis the last time, Miss Lee,"
1028,IV.,"I shall see you, perchance, in this life, who can say?"
1029,IV.,"I leave on the morrow at break o' the day."""
1030,IV.,
1031,IV.,_Mabel:_
1032,IV.,
1033,IV.,"Indeed?  Why, how sudden! and may I inquire"
1034,IV.,The reason you leave us without one desire
1035,IV.,To return? for your words seem a final adieu.
1036,IV.,
1037,IV.,_Roger:_
1038,IV.,
1039,IV.,"I never expect to return, that is true,"
1040,IV.,Yet my wish is to stay.
1041,IV.,
1042,IV.,_Mabel:_
1043,IV.,
1044,IV.,Are you not your own master?
1045,IV.,
1046,IV.,_Roger:_
1047,IV.,
1048,IV.,"Alas, yes! and therein lies the cause of disaster."
1049,IV.,"Myself bids me go, my calm, reasoning part,"
1050,IV.,"The will is the man, not the poor, foolish heart,"
1051,IV.,Which is ever at war with the intellect.  So
1052,IV.,I silence its clamoring voices and go.
1053,IV.,"Were I less my own master, I then might remain."
1054,IV.,
1055,IV.,_Mabel:_
1056,IV.,
1057,IV.,"Your words are but riddles, I beg you explain."
1058,IV.,
1059,IV.,_Roger:_
1060,IV.,
1061,IV.,"No, no, rather bid me keep silent!  To say"
1062,IV.,Why I go were as weak on my part as to stay.
1063,IV.,
1064,IV.,_Mabel:_
1065,IV.,
1066,IV.,"I think you most cruel!  You know, sir, my sex"
1067,IV.,Loves dearly a secret.  Then why should you vex
1068,IV.,And torment me in this way by hinting at one?
1069,IV.,
1070,IV.,_Roger:_
1071,IV.,
1072,IV.,"Let us talk of the weather, I think the storm done."
1073,IV.,
1074,IV.,_Mabel:_
1075,IV.,
1076,IV.,"Very well!  I will go!  No, you need not come too,"
1077,IV.,"And I will not shake hands, I am angry with you."
1078,IV.,
1079,IV.,_Roger:_
1080,IV.,
1081,IV.,And you will not shake hands when we part for all time?
1082,IV.,
1083,IV.,_Mabel:_
1084,IV.,
1085,IV.,Then read me your riddle!
1086,IV.,
1087,IV.,_Roger:_
1088,IV.,
1089,IV.,"No, that were a crime"
1090,IV.,"Against honor and friendship; girl, girl, have a care--"
1091,IV.,"You are goading my poor, tortured heart to despair."
1092,IV.,
1093,IV.,His last words were lost in the loud thunder's crash;
1094,IV.,The sea seemed ablaze with a sulphurous flash.
1095,IV.,From the rocks just above them an evergreen tree
1096,IV.,Was torn up by the roots and flung into the sea.
1097,IV.,The waves with rude arms hurled it back on the shore;
1098,IV.,The wind gained in fury.  The glare and the roar
1099,IV.,"Of the lightning and tempest paled Mabel Lee's cheek,"
1100,IV.,Her pupils dilated; she sprang with a shriek
1101,IV.,"Of a terrified child lost to all save alarm,"
1102,IV.,"And clasped Roger Montrose with both hands by the arm,"
1103,IV.,"While her cheek pressed his shoulder.  An agony, sweet"
1104,IV.,"And unbearable, thrilled from his head to his feet,"
1105,IV.,"His veins were like rivers, with billows of fire:"
1106,IV.,His will lost control; and long fettered desire
1107,IV.,"Slipped its leash.  He caught Mabel Lee to his breast,"
1108,IV.,"Drew her face up to his, on her frightened lips pressed"
1109,IV.,Wild caresses of passion that startled and shocked.
1110,IV.,"Like a madman he looked, like a madman he talked,"
1111,IV.,"Waiting not for reply, with no pause but a kiss,"
1112,IV.,While his iron arms welded her bosom to his.
1113,IV.,"""Girl, girl, you demanded my secret,"" he cried;"
1114,IV.,"""Well, that bruise on your lips tells the story!  I tried,"
1115,IV.,"Good God, how I tried! to be silent and go"
1116,IV.,"Without speaking one word, without letting you know"
1117,IV.,That I loved you; yet how could you look in my eyes
1118,IV.,And not see love was there like the sun in the skies?
1119,IV.,"Ah, those hands on my arm--that dear head lightly pressed"
1120,IV.,"On my shoulder!  God, woman, the heart in my breast"
1121,IV.,"Was dry powder, your touch was the spark; and the blame"
1122,IV.,Must be yours if both lives are scorched black with the flame.
1123,IV.,"Do you hate me, despise me, for being so weak?"
1124,IV.,"No, no! let me kiss you again ere you speak!"
1125,IV.,You are mine for the moment; and mine--mine alone
1126,IV.,Is the first taste of passion your soft mouth has known.
1127,IV.,"Whoever forestalls me in winning your hand,"
1128,IV.,Between you and him shall this mad moment stand--
1129,IV.,"You shall think of me, though you think only to hate."
1130,IV.,There--speak to me--speak to me--tell me my fate;
1131,IV.,"On your words, Mabel Lee, hangs my whole future life."
1132,IV.,"I covet you, covet you, sweet, for my wife;"
1133,IV.,I want to stay here at your side.  Since I first
1134,IV.,Saw your face I have felt an unquenchable thirst
1135,IV.,"To be good--to look deep in your eyes and find God,"
1136,IV.,And to leave in the past the dark paths I have trod
1137,IV.,"In my search after pleasure.  Ah, must I go back"
1138,IV.,"Into folly again, to retread the old track"
1139,IV.,"Which leads out into nothingness?  Girl, answer me,"
1140,IV.,"As souls answer at Judgment."""
1141,IV.,
1142,IV.,The face of the sea
1143,IV.,Shone with sudden pink splendor.  The riotous wind
1144,IV.,Swooned away with exhaustion.  Each dark cloud seemed lined
1145,IV.,With vermilion.  The tempest was over.  A word
1146,IV.,Floated up like a feather; the silence was stirred
1147,IV.,By the soul of a sigh.  The last remnant of gray
1148,IV.,"In the skies turned to gold, as a voice whispered, ""Stay."""
1149,IV.,
1150,IV.,
1151,IV.,
1152,IV.,
1153,IV.,_God grinds His poor people to powder
1154,IV.,"All day and all night I can hear,"
1155,IV.,Their cries growing louder and louder.
1156,IV.,"Oh, God, have You deadened Your ear?_"
1157,IV.,
1158,IV.,_The chimes in old Trinity steeple
1159,IV.,"Ring in the sweet season of prayer,"
1160,IV.,"And still God is grinding His people,"
1161,IV.,He is grinding them down to despair._
1162,IV.,
1163,IV.,"_Mind, body and muscle and marrow,"
1164,IV.,He grinds them again and again.
1165,IV.,Can He who takes heed of the sparrow
1166,IV.,Be blind to the tortures of men?_
1167,IV.,
1168,IV.,
1169,IV.,
1170,IV.,
1171,V.,V.
1172,V.,
1173,V.,In a bare little room of a tenement row
1174,V.,"Of the city, Maurice sat alone.  It was so"
1175,V.,(In this nearness to life's darkest phases of grief
1176,V.,And despair) that his own bitter woe found relief.
1177,V.,Joy needs no companion; but sorrow and pain
1178,V.,Long to comrade with sorrow.  The flowery chain
1179,V.,Flung by Pleasure about her gay votaries breaks
1180,V.,With the least strain upon it.  The chain sorrow makes
1181,V.,Links heart unto heart.  As a bullock will fly
1182,V.,"To far fields when an arrow has pierced him, to die,"
1183,V.,So Maurice had flown over far oceans to find
1184,V.,"No balm for his wounds, and no peace for his mind."
1185,V.,"Cosmopolitan, always, is sorrow; at home"
1186,V.,"In all countries and lands, thriving well while we roam"
1187,V.,"In vain efforts to slay it.  Toil only, brings peace"
1188,V.,To the tempest tossed heart.  What in travel Maurice
1189,V.,Failed to find--self-forgetfulness--came with his work
1190,V.,For the suffering poor in the slums of New York.
1191,V.,
1192,V.,He had wandered in strange heathen countries--had been
1193,V.,Among barbarous hordes; but the greed and the sin
1194,V.,Of his own native land seemed the shame of the hour.
1195,V.,"In his gold there was balm, in his pen there was power"
1196,V.,"To comfort the needy, to aid and defend"
1197,V.,"The unfortunate.  Close in their midst, as a friend"
1198,V.,"And companion, for more than twelve months he had dwelt."
1199,V.,Like a ray of pure light in a cellar was felt
1200,V.,"This strong, wholesome presence.  His little room bare"
1201,V.,"Of all luxuries, taught the poor souls who flocked there"
1202,V.,"For his counsel and aid, how by mere cleanliness"
1203,V.,The grim features of want lose some lines of distress.
1204,V.,"The slips from the plants on his window ledge, given"
1205,V.,"To beauty starved souls, spoke more clearly of heaven"
1206,V.,And God than did sermons or dry creedy tracts.
1207,V.,Maurice was no preacher; and yet his kind acts
1208,V.,Of mercy and self-immolation sufficed
1209,V.,To wake in dark minds a bright image of Christ--
1210,V.,"The Christ often heard of, but doubted before."
1211,V.,Maurice spoke no word of religion.  Of yore
1212,V.,His heart had accepted the creeds of his youth
1213,V.,"Without pausing to cavil, or question their truth."
1214,V.,"Faith seemed his inheritance.  But, with the blow"
1215,V.,"Which slew love and killed friendship, faith, too, seemed to go."
1216,V.,
1217,V.,"It is easy to be optimistic in pleasure,"
1218,V.,But when Pain stands us up by her portal to measure
1219,V.,"The actual height of our trust and belief,"
1220,V.,Ah! then is the time when our faith comes to grief.
1221,V.,"The woes of our fellows, God sends them, 'tis plain;"
1222,V.,But the devil himself is the cause of _our_ pain.
1223,V.,"We question the wisdom that rules o'er the world,"
1224,V.,And our minds into chaos and darkness are hurled.
1225,V.,
1226,V.,The average scoffer at faith goes about
1227,V.,Pouring into the ears of his fellows each doubt
1228,V.,Which assails him.  One truth he fails wholly to heed;
1229,V.,That a doubt oft repeated may bore like a creed.
1230,V.,
1231,V.,"Maurice kept his thoughts to himself, but his pen"
1232,V.,"Was dipped in the gall of his heart now and then,"
1233,V.,And his muse was the mouthpiece.  The sin unforgiven
1234,V.,I hold by the Cherubim chanting in heaven
1235,V.,Is the sin of the poet who dares sing a strain
1236,V.,Which adds to the world's awful chorus of pain
1237,V.,And repinings.  The souls whom the gods bless at birth
1238,V.,"With the great gift of song, have been sent to the earth"
1239,V.,To better and brighten it.  Woe to the heart
1240,V.,Which lets its own sorrow embitter its art.
1241,V.,Unto him shall more sorrow be given; and life
1242,V.,"After life filled with sorrow, till, spent with the strife,"
1243,V.,"He shall cease from rebellion, and bow to the rod"
1244,V.,"In submission, and own and acknowledge his God."
1245,V.,
1246,V.,"Maurice, with his unwilling muse in the gloom"
1247,V.,"Of a mood pessimistic, was shut in his room."
1248,V.,"A whistle, a step on the stairway, a knock,"
1249,V.,Then over the transom there fluttered a flock
1250,V.,"Of white letters.  The Muse, with a sigh of content,"
1251,V.,"Left the poet to read them, and hurriedly went"
1252,V.,Back to pleasanter regions.  Maurice glanced them through:
1253,V.,There were brief business epistles from two
1254,V.,"Daily papers, soliciting work from his pen;"
1255,V.,A woman begged money for Christ's sake; three men
1256,V.,Asked employment; a mother wrote only to say
1257,V.,How she blessed him and prayed God to bless him each day
1258,V.,For his kindness to her and to hers; and the last
1259,V.,Was a letter from Ruth.  The pale ghost of the past
1260,V.,"Rose out of its poor shallow grave, with the scent"
1261,V.,"And the mold of the clay clinging to it, and leant"
1262,V.,"O'er Maurice as he read, while its breath fanned his cheek."
1263,V.,
1264,V.,"""Forgive me,"" wrote Ruth; ""for at last I must speak"
1265,V.,Of the two whom you wish to forget.  Well I know
1266,V.,"How you suffered, still suffer, from fate's sudden blow,"
1267,V.,"Though I am a woman, and women must stay"
1268,V.,And fight out pain's battles where men run away.
1269,V.,"But my strength has its limit, my courage its end,"
1270,V.,"The time has now come when I, too, leave Bay Bend."
1271,V.,"Maurice, let the bitterness housed in your heart"
1272,V.,"For the man you long loved as a comrade, depart,"
1273,V.,"And let pity replace it.  Oh, weep for his sorrow--"
1274,V.,"From your fountain of grief, held in check, let me borrow;"
1275,V.,I have so overdrawn on the bank of my tears
1276,V.,That my anguish is now refused payment.  For years
1277,V.,"You loved Mabel Lee.  Well, to some hearts love speaks"
1278,V.,His whole tale of passion in brief little weeks.
1279,V.,"As Minerva, full grown, from the great brow of Jove"
1280,V.,"Sprang to life, so full blown from our breasts may spring Love."
1281,V.,Love hid like a bee in my heart's lily cup;
1282,V.,I knew not he was there till his sting woke me up.
1283,V.,
1284,V.,"Maurice, oh Maurice!  Can you fancy the woe"
1285,V.,Of seeing the prize which you coveted so
1286,V.,"Misused, or abused, by another?  The wife"
1287,V.,Of the man whom I worshiped is spoiling the life
1288,V.,"That was wax in her hands, wax to shape as she chose."
1289,V.,"You were blind to her faults, so was Roger Montrose."
1290,V.,"Both saw but the saint; well, let saints keep their places,"
1291,V.,And not crowd the women in life's hurried races.
1292,V.,"As saint, Mabel Lee might succeed; but, oh brother,"
1293,V.,She never was meant for a wife or a mother.
1294,V.,Her beautiful home has the desolate air
1295,V.,Of a house that is ruled by its servants.  The care--
1296,V.,"The thought of the _woman_ (that sweet, subtle power"
1297,V.,"Pervading some rooms like the scent of a flower),"
1298,V.,Which turns house into home--_that_ is lacking.  She goes
1299,V.,"On her merciful rounds, does our Lady Montrose,"
1300,V.,"Looking after the souls of the heathen, and leaving"
1301,V.,The poor hungry soul of her lord to its grieving.
1302,V.,
1303,V.,He craves her companionship; wants her to be
1304,V.,"At his side, more his own, than the public's.  But she"
1305,V.,Holds such love is but selfish; and thinks he should make
1306,V.,Some sacrifice gladly for charity's sake.
1307,V.,"Her schools, and her clubs, and her fairs fill her time;"
1308,V.,"He wants her to travel; no, that were a crime"
1309,V.,"To go seeking for pleasure, and leave duty here."
1310,V.,God had given her work and her labor lay near.
1311,V.,A month of the theater season in town?
1312,V.,"No, the stage is an evil that needs putting down"
1313,V.,"By good people.  So, scheme as he will, the poor man"
1314,V.,Has to finally yield every project and plan
1315,V.,"To this sweet stubborn saint; for the husband, you see,"
1316,V.,"Stands last in Her thoughts.  He has come, after three"
1317,V.,"Patient years, to that knowledge; his wishes, his needs"
1318,V.,"Must always give way to her whims, or her creeds."
1319,V.,
1320,V.,She knows not the primer of loving; her soul
1321,V.,Is engrossed with the poor petty wish to _control_.
1322,V.,"And she chafes at restriction.  Love loves to be bound,"
1323,V.,And its sweetest of freedom in bondage is found.
1324,V.,She pulls at her fetters.  One worshiping heart
1325,V.,And its faithful devotion play but a small part
1326,V.,In her life.  She would rather be lauded and praised
1327,V.,"By a crowd of inferior followers, raised"
1328,V.,"To the pitiful height of their leader, than be"
1329,V.,"One man's goddess.  There, now, is the true Mabel Lee!"
1330,V.,"Grieve not that you lost her, but grieve for the one"
1331,V.,"Who with me stood last night by the corpse of his son,"
1332,V.,And with me stood alone.  Ah! how wisely and well
1333,V.,Could Mabel descant on Maternity! tell
1334,V.,Other women the way to train children to be
1335,V.,"An honor and pride to their parents!  Yet she,"
1336,V.,"From the first, left her child to the nurses.  She found"
1337,V.,'Twas a tax on her nerves to have baby around
1338,V.,"When it worried and cried.  The nurse knew what to do,"
1339,V.,And a block down the street lived Mama! 'twixt the two
1340,V.,Little Roger would surely be cared for.  She must
1341,V.,Keep her strength and be worthy the love and the trust
1342,V.,"Of the poor, who were yearly increasing, and not"
1343,V.,Bestow on her own all the care and the thought--
1344,V.,"That were selfishness, surely."
1345,V.,
1346,V.,"Well, the babe grew apace,"
1347,V.,But yesterday morning a flush on its face
1348,V.,And a look in its eye worried Roger.  The mother
1349,V.,Was due at some sort of convention or other
1350,V.,In Boston--I think 'twas a grand federation
1351,V.,Of clubs formed by women to rescue the Nation
1352,V.,From man's awful clutches; and Mabel was made
1353,V.,The head delegate of the Bay Bend Brigade.
1354,V.,"Once drop in a small, selfish nature the seed"
1355,V.,"Of ambition for place, and it grows like a weed."
1356,V.,"The fair village angel we called Mabel Lee,"
1357,V.,"As Mrs. Montrose, has developed, you see,"
1358,V.,To a full fledged Reformer.  It quite turned her head
1359,V.,To be sent to the city of beans and brown bread
1360,V.,As a delegate!  (Delegate! magical word!
1361,V.,The heart of the queer modern woman is stirred
1362,V.,Far more by its sound than by aught she may hear
1363,V.,In the phrases poor Cupid pours into her ear.)
1364,V.,"Mabel chirped to the baby a dozen good-byes,"
1365,V.,"And laughed at the trouble in Roger's grave eyes,"
1366,V.,As she leaned o'er the lace ruffled crib of her son
1367,V.,"And talked baby-talk: ""Now be good, 'ittle one,"
1368,V.,"While Mama is away, and don't draw a long breath,"
1369,V.,Unless 'oo would worry Papa half to death.
1370,V.,"And don't cough, and, of all things, don't _sneeze_, 'ittle dear,"
1371,V.,Or Papa will be thrown into spasms of fear.
1372,V.,"Now, good-bye, once again, 'ittle man; mother knows"
1373,V.,There is no other baby like Roger Montrose
1374,V.,"In the whole world to-day."""
1375,V.,
1376,V.,So she left him.  That night
1377,V.,The nurse sent a messenger speeding in fright
1378,V.,For the Doctor; a second for Grandmama Lee
1379,V.,And Roger despatched still another for me.
1380,V.,All in vain! through the gray chilly paths of the dawn
1381,V.,The soul of the beautiful baby passed on
1382,V.,Into Mother-filled lands.
1383,V.,
1384,V.,"Ah! my God, the despair"
1385,V.,Of seeing that agonized sufferer there;
1386,V.,"To stand by his side, yet denied the relief"
1387,V.,"Of sharing, as wife, and as mother, his grief."
1388,V.,Enough!  I have borne all I can bear.  The role
1389,V.,Of friend to a lover pulls hard on the soul
1390,V.,Of a sensitive woman.  The three words in life
1391,V.,"Which have meaning to me are home, mother and wife--"
1392,V.,"Or, rather, wife, mother and home.  Once I thought"
1393,V.,Men cared for the women who found home the spot
1394,V.,Next to heaven for happiness; women who knew
1395,V.,"No ambition beyond being loyal and true,"
1396,V.,"And who loved all the tasks of the housewife.  I learn,"
1397,V.,"Instead, that from women of that kind men turn,"
1398,V.,"With a yawn, unto those who are useless; who live"
1399,V.,"For the poor hollow world and for what it can give,"
1400,V.,"And who make home the spot where, when other joys cease,"
1401,V.,One sleeps late when one wishes.
1402,V.,
1403,V.,You left me Maurice
1404,V.,"Left the home I have kept since our dear Mother died,"
1405,V.,"With such sisterly love and such housewifely pride,"
1406,V.,"And you wandered afar, and for what cause, forsooth?"
1407,V.,"Oh! because a vain, self-loving woman, in truth,"
1408,V.,"Had been faithless.  The man whom I worshiped, ignored"
1409,V.,The love and the _comfort_ my woman's heart stored
1410,V.,"In its depths for his taking, and sought Mabel Lee."
1411,V.,"Well, I'm done with the role of the housewife.  I see"
1412,V.,There is nothing in being domestic.  The part
1413,V.,"Is unpicturesque, and at war with all art."
1414,V.,The senile old Century leers with dim eyes
1415,V.,At our sex and demands that we shock or surprise
1416,V.,His thin blood into motion.  The home's not the place
1417,V.,To bring a pleased smile to his wicked old face.
1418,V.,"To the mandate I bow; since all strive for that end,"
1419,V.,I must join the great throng!  I am leaving Bay Bend
1420,V.,This day week.  I will see you in town as I pass
1421,V.,"To the college at C----, where I enter the class"
1422,V.,Of medical students--I fancy you will
1423,V.,"Like to see my name thus--Dr. Ruth Somerville."""
1424,V.,
1425,V.,"Maurice dropped the long, closely written epistle,"
1426,V.,"Stared hard at the wall, and gave vent to a whistle."
1427,V.,"A Doctor! his sweet, little home-loving sister."
1428,V.,A Doctor! one might as well prefix a Mister
1429,V.,"To Ruth Somerville, that most feminine name."
1430,V.,And then in the wake of astonishment came
1431,V.,"Keen pity for all she had suffered.  ""Poor Ruth,"
1432,V.,"She writes like an agonized woman, in truth,"
1433,V.,"And like one torn with jealousy.  Ah, I can see,"""
1434,V.,"He mused, ""how the pure soul of sweet Mabel Lee"
1435,V.,Revolts at the bondage and shrinks from the ban
1436,V.,That lies in the love of that sensual man.
1437,V.,"He is of the earth, earthy.  He loves but her beauty,"
1438,V.,"He cares not for conscience, or honor or duty."
1439,V.,Like a moth she was dazzled and lured by the flame
1440,V.,"Of a light she thought love, till she learned its true name;"
1441,V.,"When she found it mere passion, it lost all its charms."
1442,V.,No wonder she flies from his fettering arms!
1443,V.,"God pity you, Mabel! poor ill mated wife;"
1444,V.,"But my love, like a planet, shall watch o'er your life,"
1445,V.,"Though all other light from your skies disappear,"
1446,V.,Like a sun in the darkness my love shall appear.
1447,V.,"Unselfish and silent, it asks no return,"
1448,V.,"But while the great firmament lasts it shall burn."""

1497,VI.,
1498,VI.,"Wooed, wedded and widowed ere twenty.  The life"
1499,VI.,Of Zoe Travers is told in that sentence.  A wife
1500,VI.,"For one year, loved and loving; so full of life's joy"
1501,VI.,"That death, growing jealous, resolved to destroy"
1502,VI.,The Eden she dwelt in.  Five desolate years
1503,VI.,"She walked robed in weeds, and bathed ever in tears,"
1504,VI.,Through the valley of memory.  Locked in love's tomb
1505,VI.,Lay youth in its glory and hope in its bloom.
1506,VI.,"At times she was filled with religious devotion,"
1507,VI.,Again crushed to earth with rebellious emotion
1508,VI.,And unresigned sorrow.
1509,VI.,
1510,VI.,"Ah, wild was her grief!"
1511,VI.,And the years seemed to bring her no balm of relief.
1512,VI.,"When a heart from its sorrow time cannot estrange,"
1513,VI.,God sends it another to alter and change
1514,VI.,"The current of feeling.  Zoe's mother, her one"
1515,VI.,"Tie to earth, became ill.  When the doctors had done"
1516,VI.,"All the harm which they dared do with powder and pill,"
1517,VI.,They ordered a trial of Dame Nature's skill.
1518,VI.,Dear Nature! what grief in her bosom must stir
1519,VI.,When she sees us turn everywhere save unto her
1520,VI.,For the health she holds always in keeping; and sees
1521,VI.,"Us at last, when too late, creeping back to her knees,"
1522,VI.,Begging that she at first could have given!
1523,VI.,
1524,VI.,'Twas so
1525,VI.,"Mother Nature's heart grieved o'er the mother of Zoe,"
1526,VI.,Who came but to die on her bosom.  She died
1527,VI.,Where the mocking bird poured out its passionate tide
1528,VI.,Of lush music; and all through the dark days of pain
1529,VI.,"That succeeded, and over and through the refrain"
1530,VI.,"Of her sorrow, Zoe heard that wild song evermore."
1531,VI.,It seemed like a blow which pushed open a door
1532,VI.,"In her heart.  Something strange, sweet and terrible stirred"
1533,VI.,"In her nature, aroused by the song of that bird."
1534,VI.,It rang like a voice from the future; a call
1535,VI.,That came not from the past; yet the past held her all.
1536,VI.,To the past she had plighted her vows; in the past
1537,VI.,"Lay her one dream of happiness, first, only, last."
1538,VI.,
1539,VI.,"Alone in the world now, she felt the unrest"
1540,VI.,Of an unanchored boat on the wild billow's breast.
1541,VI.,Two homes had been shattered; the West held but tombs.
1542,VI.,She drifted again where the magnolia blooms
1543,VI.,"And the mocking bird sings.  Oh! that song, that wild strain,"
1544,VI.,Whose echoes still haunted her heart and her brain!
1545,VI.,How she listened to hear it repeated!  It came
1546,VI.,"Through the dawn to her heart, and the sound was like flame."
1547,VI.,"It chased all the shadows of night from her room,"
1548,VI.,And burst the closed bud of the day into bloom.
1549,VI.,"It leaped to the heavens, it sank to the earth"
1550,VI.,It gave life new rapture and love a new birth.
1551,VI.,"It ran through her veins like a fiery stream,"
1552,VI.,And the past and its sorrow--was only a dream.
1553,VI.,
1554,VI.,The call of a bird in the spring for its lover
1555,VI.,Is the voice of all Nature when winter is over.
1556,VI.,"The heart of the woman re-echoed the strain,"
1557,VI.,"And its meaning, at last, to her senses was plain."
1558,VI.,
1559,VI.,"Grief's winter was over, the snows from her heart"
1560,VI.,Were melted; hope's blossoms were ready to start.
1561,VI.,"The spring had returned with its siren delights,"
1562,VI.,And her youth and emotions asserted their rights.
1563,VI.,Then memory struggled with passion.  The dead
1564,VI.,Seemed to rise from the grave and accuse her.  She fled
1565,VI.,"From her thoughts as from lepers; returned to old ways,"
1566,VI.,"And strove to keep occupied, filling her days"
1567,VI.,With devotional duties.  But when the night came
1568,VI.,"She heard through her slumber that song like a flame,"
1569,VI.,And her dreams were sweet torture.  She sought all too soon
1570,VI.,To chill the warm sun of her youth's ardent noon
1571,VI.,With the shadows of premature evening.  Her mind
1572,VI.,"Lacked direction and purpose.  She tried in a blind,"
1573,VI.,Groping fashion to follow an early ideal
1574,VI.,"Of love and of constancy, starving the real"
1575,VI.,Affectional nature God gave her.  She prayed
1576,VI.,"For God's help in unmaking the woman He made,"
1577,VI.,As if He repented the thing He had done.
1578,VI.,"With the soul of a Sappho, she lived like a nun,"
1579,VI.,"Hid her thoughts from all women, from men kept apart,"
1580,VI.,And carefully guarded the book of her heart
1581,VI.,"From the world's prying eyes.  Yet men read through the cover,"
1582,VI.,And knew that the story was food for a lover.
1583,VI.,(The dullest of men seemed possessed of the art
1584,VI.,To read what the passions inscribe on the heart.
1585,VI.,"Though written in cipher and sealed from the sight,"
1586,VI.,Yet masculine eyes will interpret aright.)
1587,VI.,"Worn out with the unceasing conflict at last,"
1588,VI.,"Zoe fled from herself and her sorrowful past,"
1589,VI.,And turned to new scenes for diversion from thought.
1590,VI.,
1591,VI.,"New York! oh, what magic encircles that spot"
1592,VI.,"In the feminine mind of the West!  There, it seems,"
1593,VI.,Waits the realization of beautiful dreams.
1594,VI.,"There the waters of Lethe unceasingly roll,"
1595,VI.,"With blessed forgetfulness free to each soul,"
1596,VI.,"While the doorways that lead to success open wide,"
1597,VI.,With Fame in the distance to beckon and guide.
1598,VI.,"Mirth lurks in each byway, and Folly herself"
1599,VI.,"Wears the look of a semi-respectable elf,"
1600,VI.,"And is to be courted and trusted when met,"
1601,VI.,"For she teaches one how to be gay and forget,"
1602,VI.,And to start new account books with life.
1603,VI.,
1604,VI.,"It was so,"
1605,VI.,"Since she first heard the name of the city, that Zoe"
1606,VI.,Dreamed of life in New York.  It was thither she turned
1607,VI.,"To smother the heart that with restlessness burned,"
1608,VI.,And to quiet and calm an unsatisfied mind.
1609,VI.,"Her plans were but outlines, crude, vague, undefined,"
1610,VI.,"Of distraction and pleasure.  A snug little home,"
1611,VI.,With seclusion and comfort; full freedom to roam
1612,VI.,"Where her fancy and income permitted; new faces,"
1613,VI.,"New scenes, new environments, far from the places"
1614,VI.,Where brief joy and long sorrow had dwelt with her; free
1615,VI.,From the curious eyes that seemed ever to be
1616,VI.,"Bent upon her.  She passed like a ship from the port,"
1617,VI.,Without chart or compass; the plaything and sport
1618,VI.,Of the billows of Fate.
1619,VI.,
1620,VI.,The parks were all gay
1621,VI.,And busy with costuming duties of May
1622,VI.,When Zoe reached New York.  The rain and the breeze
1623,VI.,Had freshened the gowns of the Northern pine trees
1624,VI.,Till they looked bright as new; all the willows were seen
1625,VI.,In soft dainty garments of exquisite green.
1626,VI.,"Young buds swelled with life, and reached out to invite"
1627,VI.,And to hold the warm gaze of the wandering light.
1628,VI.,The turf exhaled fragrance; among the green boughs
1629,VI.,"The unabashed city birds plighted their vows,"
1630,VI.,Or happy young house hunters chirped of the best
1631,VI.,And most suitable nook to establish a nest.
1632,VI.,
1633,VI.,"There was love in the sunshine, and love in the air;"
1634,VI.,"Youth, hope, home, companionship, spring, everywhere."
1635,VI.,"There was youth, there was spring in her blood; yet she only,"
1636,VI.,"In all the great city, seemed loveless and lonely."
1637,VI.,
1638,VI.,"The trim little flat, facing north on the park,"
1639,VI.,Was not homelike; the rooms seemed too sombre and dark
1640,VI.,"To her eyes, sun-accustomed; the neighbors too near"
1641,VI.,And too noisy.  The medley of sounds hurt her ear.
1642,VI.,Sudden laughter; the cry of an infant; the splash
1643,VI.,Of a tenant below in his bath-tub; the crash
1644,VI.,"Of strong hands on a keyboard above, and the light,"
1645,VI.,"Merry voice of the lady who lived opposite,"
1646,VI.,"The air intertwined in a tangled sound ball,"
1647,VI.,And flung straight at her ear through the court and the hall.
1648,VI.,
1649,VI.,"Ah, what loneliness dwelt in the rush and the stir"
1650,VI.,"Of the great pushing throngs that were nothing to her,"
1651,VI.,"And to whom she was nothing!  Her heart, on its quest"
1652,VI.,"For distraction, seemed eating itself in her breast."
1653,VI.,"She longed for a comrade, a friend.  In the church"
1654,VI.,"Which she frequented no one abetted her search,"
1655,VI.,For the faces of people she met in its aisle
1656,VI.,"Gazed calmly beyond her, without glance or smile."
1657,VI.,"The look in their eyes, when translated, read thus,"
1658,VI.,"""We worship God here, what are people to us?"""
1659,VI.,"In some masculine eyes she read more, it is true."
1660,VI.,What she read made her gaze at the floor of her pew.
1661,VI.,
1662,VI.,"The blithe little blonde who lived over the hall,"
1663,VI.,"In the opposite rooms, was the first one to call"
1664,VI.,"Or to show friendly feeling.  She seemed sweet and kind,"
1665,VI.,But her infantile face hid a mercantile mind.
1666,VI.,Her voice had the timbre of metal.  Each word
1667,VI.,"Clinked each word like small change in a purse; and you heard,"
1668,VI.,"In the rustling silk of her skirts, just a hint"
1669,VI.,Of new bills freshly printed and right from the mint.
1670,VI.,
1671,VI.,There was that in her airs and her chatter which made
1672,VI.,"Zoe question and ponder, and turn half afraid"
1673,VI.,From her proffers of friendship.  When one July day
1674,VI.,"The fair neighbor called for a moment to say,"
1675,VI.,"""I am off to Long Branch for the summer, good-bye,"""
1676,VI.,"Zoe seemed to breathe freer--she scarcely knew why,"
1677,VI.,But she reasoned it out as alone in the gloom
1678,VI.,Of the soft summer evening she sat in her room.
1679,VI.,"""The woman is happy,"" she said; ""at the least,"
1680,VI.,Her heart is not starving in life's ample feast.
1681,VI.,"She lives while she lives, but I only exist,"
1682,VI.,"And Fate laughs in my face for the things I resist."""
1683,VI.,
1684,VI.,New York in the midsummer seems like the gay
1685,VI.,Upper servant who rules with the mistress away.
1686,VI.,She entertains friends from all parts of the earth;
1687,VI.,Her streets are alive with a fictitious mirth.
1688,VI.,She flaunts her best clothes with a devil-may-care
1689,VI.,"Sort of look, and her parks wear a riotous air."
1690,VI.,There is something unwholesome about her at dusk;
1691,VI.,"Her trees, and her gardens, seem scented with musk;"
1692,VI.,And you feel she has locked up the door of the house
1693,VI.,"And, half drunk with the heat, wanders forth to carouse,"
1694,VI.,"With virtue, ambition and industry all"
1695,VI.,Packed off (moth-protected) with garments for Fall.
1696,VI.,
1697,VI.,Zoe felt out of step with the town.  In the song
1698,VI.,"Which it sang, where each note was a soul of the throng,"
1699,VI.,She seemed the one discord.  Books gave no distraction.
1700,VI.,"She cared not for study, her heart longed for action,"
1701,VI.,"For pleasure, excitement.  Wild impulses, new"
1702,VI.,"To her mind, came like demons and urged her to do"
1703,VI.,All sorts of mad things.  Mischief breathed through the air.
1704,VI.,One could do as one liked in New York--who would care--
1705,VI.,Who would know save the God who had left her alone
1706,VI.,"In his world, unprotected, unloved?  From her own"
1707,VI.,Restless mind and sick heart she attempted once more
1708,VI.,To escape.  One reads much of gay life at the shore--
1709,VI.,"Narragansett, she fancied, would suit her.  The sea"
1710,VI.,"Would at least prove a friend; and, perchance, there might be"
1711,VI.,"Some heart, like her own, seeking comradeship there."
1712,VI.,"The days brought no friend.  But the moist, salty air"
1713,VI.,"Was a stimulant, giving existence new charms."
1714,VI.,The sea was a lover who opened his arms
1715,VI.,Every day to embrace her.  And life in this place
1716,VI.,"Held something of pleasure, and sweetness and grace,"
1717,VI.,"Though the eyes of the men were too ardent and bold,"
1718,VI.,"And the eyes of the women suspicious and cold,"
1719,VI.,"She yet had the sea--the sea, strong and mighty,"
1720,VI.,Both father and mother of fair Aphrodite.
1721,VI.,
1722,VI.,
1723,VI.,
1724,VI.,
1725,VII.,VII.
1726,VII.,
1727,VII.,"Mabel grieved for her child with a sorrow sincere,"
1728,VII.,But she bowed to the will of her Maker.  No tear
1729,VII.,"Came to soften the hard, stony look in the eye"
1730,VII.,Of her husband; she heard no complaint and no sigh
1731,VII.,"From his lips, but he turned with impatience whenever"
1732,VII.,"She spoke of religion, or made one endeavor"
1733,VII.,To lead his thoughts up from the newly turned sod
1734,VII.,"Where the little form slept, to its spirit with God."
1735,VII.,
1736,VII.,"Long hours by that grave, Roger passed, and alone."
1737,VII.,"The woes of her neighbors his wife made her own,"
1738,VII.,But her husband she pointed to Christ; and in grief
1739,VII.,Prayed for light to be cast on his dark unbelief.
1740,VII.,
1741,VII.,"She flung herself into good works more and more,"
1742,VII.,And saw not that the look which her husband's face wore
1743,VII.,Was the look of a man starved for love.  In the mold
1744,VII.,"Of a nun she was fashioned, chaste, passionless, cold."
1745,VII.,(Such women sin more when they take marriage ties
1746,VII.,Than the love-maddened creature who lawlessly lies
1747,VII.,In the arms of the man whom she worships.  The child
1748,VII.,Not conceived in true love leaves the mother defiled.
1749,VII.,"Though an army of clergymen sanction her vows,"
1750,VII.,"God sees ""illegitimate"" stamped on the brows"
1751,VII.,Of her offspring.  Love only can legalize birth
1752,VII.,In His eyes--all the rest is but spawn of the earth.)
1753,VII.,
1754,VII.,"Mabel Lee, as the maid, had been flattered and pleased"
1755,VII.,By the passion of Roger; his wild wooing teased
1756,VII.,"That inquisitive sense, half a fault, half a merit,"
1757,VII.,"Which the daughters of Eve, to a woman, inherit."
1758,VII.,His love fanned her love for herself to a glow;
1759,VII.,She was stirred by the thought she could stir a man so.
1760,VII.,That was all.  She had nothing to give in return.
1761,VII.,One can't light a fire with no fuel to burn;
1762,VII.,And the love Roger dreamed he could rouse in her soul
1763,VII.,Was not there to be wakened.  He stood at his goal
1764,VII.,"As the Arctic explorer may finally stand,"
1765,VII.,"To see all about him an ice prisoned land,"
1766,VII.,"White, beautiful, useless."
1767,VII.,
1768,VII.,"Some women are chaste,"
1769,VII.,Like the snows which envelop the bleak arid waste
1770,VII.,"Of the desert; once melted, alas! what remains"
1771,VII.,"But the poor, unproductive, dry soil of the plains?"
1772,VII.,"The flora of Cupid will never be found,"
1773,VII.,"However he toil there, to thrive in such ground."
1774,VII.,
1775,VII.,Mabel Montrose was held in the highest esteem
1776,VII.,By her neighbors; I think neighbors everywhere deem
1777,VII.,Such women to be all that's noble.  They sighed
1778,VII.,When they spoke of her husband; they told how she tried
1779,VII.,"To convert him, and how they had thought for a season"
1780,VII.,"His mind was bent Christ-ward; and then, with no reason,"
1781,VII.,"He seemed to drift back to the world, and grew jealous"
1782,VII.,"Of Mabel, and thought her too faithful and zealous"
1783,VII.,In duty to others.
1784,VII.,
1785,VII.,The death of his child
1786,VII.,"Only hardened his heart against God.  He grew wild,"
1787,VII.,"Took to drink; spent a week at a time in the city,"
1788,VII.,Neglecting his saint of a wife--such a pity.
1789,VII.,It was true.  Our friends keep a sharp eye on our deeds
1790,VII.,But the fine interlining of causes--who heeds?
1791,VII.,The long list of heartaches which lead to rash acts
1792,VII.,"Would bring pity, not blame, if the world knew the facts."
1793,VII.,
1794,VII.,"There are women so terribly free from all evil,"
1795,VII.,"They discourage a man, and he goes to the devil."
1796,VII.,"There are people whose virtues result in appalling,"
1797,VII.,And they prove a great aid to his majesty's calling.
1798,VII.,
1799,VII.,"Roger's wife rendered goodness so dreary and cold,"
1800,VII.,His tendril-like will lost its poor little hold
1801,VII.,"On the new better life he was longing to reach,"
1802,VII.,"And slipped back to the dust.  Oh! to love, not to preach."
1803,VII.,Is a woman's true method of helping mankind.
1804,VII.,"The sinner is won through his heart, not his mind."
1805,VII.,"As the sun loves the seed up to life through the sod,"
1806,VII.,So the patience of love brings a soul to its God.
1807,VII.,"But when love is lacking, the devil is sure"
1808,VII.,To stand in the pathway with some sort of lure.
1809,VII.,Roger turned to the world for distraction.  The world
1810,VII.,"Smiled a welcome, and then like an octopus curled"
1811,VII.,"All its tentacles 'round him, and dragged him away"
1812,VII.,"Into deep, troubled waters."
1813,VII.,
1814,VII.,One late summer day
1815,VII.,"He awoke with a headache, which will not surprise,"
1816,VII.,"When you know that his bedtime had been at sunrise,"
1817,VII.,"And that gay Narraganset, the world renowned ""Pier,"""
1818,VII.,Was the scene.  Through the lace curtained window the clear
1819,VII.,Yellow rays of the hot August sun touched his bed
1820,VII.,"And proclaimed it was mid-day.  He rose, and his head"
1821,VII.,Seemed as large and as light as an air filled balloon
1822,VII.,While his limbs were like lead.
1823,VII.,
1824,VII.,"In the glare of the noon,"
1825,VII.,"The follies of night show their makeup, and seem"
1826,VII.,Like hideous monsters evoked by some dream.
1827,VII.,
1828,VII.,"The sea called to Roger: ""Come, lie on my breast"
1829,VII.,And forget the dull world.  My unrest shall give rest
1830,VII.,To your turbulent feelings; the dregs of the wine
1831,VII.,On your lips shall be lost in the salt touch of mine.
1832,VII.,"Come away, come away.  Ah! the jubilant mirth"
1833,VII.,"Of the sea is not known by the stupid old earth."""
1834,VII.,
1835,VII.,"The beach swarmed with bathers--to be more exact,"
1836,VII.,"Swarmed with people in costumes of bathers.  In fact,"
1837,VII.,Many beautiful women bathed but in the light
1838,VII.,"Of men's eyes; and their costumes were made for the sight,"
1839,VII.,Not the sea.  From the sea's lusty outreaching arms
1840,VII.,"They escaped with shrill shrieks, while the men viewed their charms"
1841,VII.,"And made mental notes of them.  Yet, at this hour,"
1842,VII.,"The waves, too, were swelling sea meadows, a-flower"
1843,VII.,"With faces of swimmers.  All dressed for his bath,"
1844,VII.,"Roger paused in confusion, because in his path"
1845,VII.,Surged a crowd of the curious; all eyes were bent
1846,VII.,On the form of a woman who leisurely went
1847,VII.,"From her bathing house down to the beach.  ""There she goes,"""
1848,VII.,"Roger heard a dame cry, as she stepped on his toes"
1849,VII.,"With her whole ample weight.  ""What, the one with red hair?"
1850,VII.,"Why, she isn't as pretty as Maude, I declare."""
1851,VII.,"A man passing by with his comrade, cried: ""Ned,"
1852,VII.,"Look! there is La Travers, the one with the red"
1853,VII.,"Braid of hair to her knees.  She's a mystery here,"
1854,VII.,"And at present the topic of talk at the Pier."""
1855,VII.,Roger followed their glances in time to behold
1856,VII.,"For a second a head crowned with braids of bright gold,"
1857,VII.,"And a form like a Venus, all costumed in white."
1858,VII.,Then she plunged through a billow and vanished from sight.
1859,VII.,
1860,VII.,"It was half an hour afterward, possibly more,"
1861,VII.,"As Roger swam farther and farther from shore,"
1862,VII.,"With new life in his limbs and new force in his brain,"
1863,VII.,"That he heard, just behind him, a sharp cry of pain."
1864,VII.,Ten strokes in the rear on the crest of a wave
1865,VII.,"Shone a woman's white face.  ""Keep your courage; be brave;"
1866,VII.,"I am coming,"" he shouted.  ""Turn over and float."""
1867,VII.,His strong shoulder plunged like the prow of a boat
1868,VII.,Through the billows.  Six overhand strokes brought him close
1869,VII.,"To the woman, who lay like a wilted white rose"
1870,VII.,"On the waves.  ""Now, be careful,"" he cried; ""lay your hand"
1871,VII.,"Well up on my shoulder; my arms, understand,"
1872,VII.,"Must be free; do not touch them---please follow my wishes,"
1873,VII.,"Unless you are anxious to fatten the fishes."""
1874,VII.,"The woman obeyed him.  ""You need not fear me,"""
1875,VII.,"She replied, ""I am wholly at home in the sea."
1876,VII.,"I knew all the arts of the swimmer, I thought,"
1877,VII.,But confess I was frightened when suddenly caught
1878,VII.,"With a cramp in my knee at this distance from shore."""
1879,VII.,With slow even breast strokes the strong swimmer bore
1880,VII.,His fair burden landward.  She lay on the billows
1881,VII.,As lightly as if she were resting on pillows
1882,VII.,Of down.  She relinquished herself to the sea
1883,VII.,"And the man, and was saved; though God knows both can be"
1884,VII.,"False and fickle enough; yet resistance or strife,"
1885,VII.,"On occasions like this, means the forfeit of life."
1886,VII.,The throng of the bathers had scattered before
1887,VII.,Roger carried his burden safe into the shore
1888,VII.,"And saw her emerge from the water, a place"
1889,VII.,Where most women lose every vestige of grace
1890,VII.,Or of charm.  But this mermaid seemed fairer than when
1891,VII.,She had challenged the glances of women and men
1892,VII.,As she went to her bath.  Now her clinging silk suit
1893,VII.,"Revealed every line, from the throat to the foot,"
1894,VII.,"Of her beautiful form.  Her arms, in their splendor,"
1895,VII.,"Gleamed white like wet marble.  The round waist was slender,"
1896,VII.,And yet not too small.  From the twin perfect crests
1897,VII.,And the virginlike grace of her beautiful breasts
1898,VII.,"To the exquisite limbs and the curve of her thigh,"
1899,VII.,"And the arch of her proud little instep, the eye"
1900,VII.,Drank in beauty.  Her face was not beautiful; yet
1901,VII.,"The gaze lingered on it, for Eros had set"
1902,VII.,"His seal on her features.  The mouth full and weak,"
1903,VII.,The blue shadow drooping from eyelid to cheek
1904,VII.,"Like a stain of crushed grapes, and the pale, ardent skin,"
1905,VII.,All spoke of volcanic emotions within.
1906,VII.,
1907,VII.,"By her tip tilted nose and low brow, it was plain"
1908,VII.,To read how her impulses ruled o'er her brain.
1909,VII.,"She had given the chief role of life to her heart,"
1910,VII.,And her intellect played but a small minor part.
1911,VII.,Her eyes were the color the sunlight reveals
1912,VII.,"When it pierces the soft, furry coat of young seals."
1913,VII.,"The thickly fringed lids seemed unwilling to rise,"
1914,VII.,"But drooped, half concealing them; wonderful eyes,"
1915,VII.,Full of secrets and bodings of sorrow.  As coarse
1916,VII.,And as thick as the mane of a finely groomed horse
1917,VII.,"Was her bright mass of hair.  The sea, with rough hands,"
1918,VII.,"Had made free with the braids, and unloosened the strands"
1919,VII.,Till they hung in great clusters of curls to her knees.
1920,VII.,"Her voice, when she spoke, held the breadth and the breeze"
1921,VII.,Of the West in its tones; and the use of the _R_
1922,VII.,Made the listener certain her home had been far
1923,VII.,From New England.  Long after she vanished from view
1924,VII.,The eye and the ear seemed to sense her anew.
1925,VII.,There was that in her voice and her presence which hung
1926,VII.,In the air like a strain of a song which is sung
1927,VII.,"By a singer, and then sings itself the whole day,"
1928,VII.,And will hot be silenced.
1929,VII.,
1930,VII.,As birds flock away
1931,VII.,"From meadow to tree branch, now there and now here,"
1932,VII.,"So, from beach to Casino, each day at the Pier"
1933,VII.,Flock the gay pleasure seekers.  The balconies glow
1934,VII.,With beauty and color.  The belle and the beau
1935,VII.,"Promenade in the sunlight, or sit tete-a-tete,"
1936,VII.,"While the chaperons gossip together.  Bands play,"
1937,VII.,Glasses clink; and 'neath sheltering lace parasols
1938,VII.,There are plans made for meeting at drives or at balls.
1939,VII.,
1940,VII.,"Roger gat at a table alone, with his glass"
1941,VII.,"Of mint julep before him, and watched the crowd pass."
1942,VII.,There were all sorts of people from all sorts of places.
1943,VII.,He thought he liked best the fair Baltimore faces.
1944,VII.,"The South was the land of fair women, he mused,"
1945,VII.,Because they were indolent.  Women who used
1946,VII.,"Mind or body too freely.  Changed curves into angles,"
1947,VII.,For beauty forever with intellect wrangles.
1948,VII.,The trend of the fair sex to-day must alarm
1949,VII.,Every lover of feminine beauty and charm.
1950,VII.,
1951,VII.,As he mused Roger watched with a keen interest
1952,VII.,"For a sight of his Undine.  ""All coiffured and drest,"
1953,VII.,"With her wonderful body concealed, and her hair"
1954,VII.,"Knotted up, well, I doubt if she seem even fair,"""
1955,VII.,"He soliloquized.  ""Ah!"" the word burst from his lips,"
1956,VII.,For he saw her approaching.  She walked from the hips
1957,VII.,With an undulous motion.  As graceful and free
1958,VII.,From all effort as waves swinging in from the sea
1959,VII.,Were her movements.  Her full molded figure seemed slight
1960,VII.,In its close fitting gown of black cloth; and the white
1961,VII.,Of her cheek seemed still whiter by contrast.  Her clothes
1962,VII.,Were tasteful and quiet; yet Roger Montrose
1963,VII.,Knew in some subtle manner he could not express
1964,VII.,('Tis an instinct men have in the matters of dress)
1965,VII.,That they never were made in New York.  By her hat
1966,VII.,One can oft read a woman's whole character.  That
1967,VII.,"Which our fair Undine wore was a thing of rich lace,"
1968,VII.,Flowers and ribbons like others one saw in the place.
1969,VII.,"Yet the width of the brim, or the twist of its bows,"
1970,VII.,Or the way it was worn made it different from those.
1971,VII.,"As it drooped o'er the eyes full of mystery there,"
1972,VII.,"It seemed, all at once, both a menace and dare;"
1973,VII.,"A menace to women, a dare to the men."
1974,VII.,She bowed as she passed Roger's table; and then
1975,VII.,"Took a chair opposite, spread her shade of red silk,"
1976,VII.,"Called a waiter and ordered a cup of hot milk,"
1977,VII.,Which she leisurely sipped.  She seemed unaware
1978,VII.,Of the curious eyes she attracted.  Her air
1979,VII.,"Was of one quite at home, and entirely at ease"
1980,VII.,"With herself, the sole person she studied to please."
1981,VII.,"She had been for three weeks at the Pier, and alone,"
1982,VII.,"Without maid or escort, and nothing was known"
1983,VII.,"Of her there, save the name which the register bore,"
1984,VII.,"""Mrs. Travers, New York.""  Men were mad to learn more"
1985,VII.,"But the women were distant.  One can't, at such places,"
1986,VII.,Accept as credentials good figures or faces.
1987,VII.,There was an unnameable _something_ about
1988,VII.,Mrs. Travers which filled other women with doubt
1989,VII.,"And all men with interest.  Roger, blasé,"
1990,VII.,"Disillusioned with life as he was, felt the sway"
1991,VII.,"Of her strong personality, there as she sat"
1992,VII.,Looking out 'neath the rim of her coquettish hat
1993,VII.,With dark eyes on the sea.  Few people had power
1994,VII.,To draw his gray thoughts from himself for an hour
1995,VII.,"As this woman had done; she was food for his mind,"
1996,VII.,And he sought by his inner perceptions to find
1997,VII.,"in what class she belonged.  ""An adventuress?  No,"
1998,VII.,Though I fancy three-fourths of the women think so
1999,VII.,"And one-half of the men; but that role leaves a trace,"
2000,VII.,"An expression, I fail to detect in her face."
2001,VII.,Her past is not shadowed; my judgment would say
2002,VII.,"That her sins lie before her, and not far away."
2003,VII.,"She's a puzzle, I think, to herself; and grim Fate"
2004,VII.,Will aid her in solving the riddle too late.
2005,VII.,Her soul dreams of happiness; but in her eyes
2006,VII.,The sensuous foe to all happiness lies.
2007,VII.,"As the rain is drawn up by some moods of the sun,"
2008,VII.,"Some natures draw trouble from life; her's is one."""
2009,VII.,
2010,VII.,"She rose and passed by him again, and her gown"
2011,VII.,Brushed his knee.  A light tremor went shivering down
2012,VII.,His whole body.  She left on the air as she went
2013,VII.,A subtle suggestion of perfume; the scent
2014,VII.,"Which steals out of some fans, or old laces, and seems"
2015,VII.,Full of soft fragrant fancies and languorous dreams.
2016,VII.,"She haunted the mind, though she passed from the sight."
2017,VII.,"When Roger Montrose sought his pillow that night,"
2018,VII.,'Twas to dream of La Travers.  He thought she became
2019,VII.,"A burning red rose, with each leaf like a flame."
2020,VII.,"He stooped down and plucked it, and woke with a start,"
2021,VII.,As it turned to an adder and struck at his heart.
2022,VII.,
2023,VII.,"The dream left its impress, as certain dreams should,"
2024,VII.,"For, as warnings of evil, precursors of good,"
2025,VII.,"They are sent to our souls o'er a mystical line,"
2026,VII.,"Night messages, couched in a cipher divine."
2027,VII.,
2028,VII.,"Roger knew much of life, much of women, and knew"
2029,VII.,Even more of himself and his weaknesses.  Few
2030,VII.,Of us mortals look inward; our gaze is turned out
2031,VII.,"To watch what the rest of the world is about,"
2032,VII.,While the rest of the world watches us.
2033,VII.,
2034,VII.,Roger's reason
2035,VII.,And logic were clear.  But his will played him treason.
2036,VII.,"If you looked at his hand, you would see it.  Hands speak"
2037,VII.,"More than faces.  His thumb (the first phalanx) was weak,"
2038,VII.,"Undeveloped; the second, firm jointed and long,"
2039,VII.,"Which showed that the reasoning powers were strong,"
2040,VII.,"But the will, from disuse, had grown feeble."
2041,VII.,
2042,VII.,That morning
2043,VII.,He looked on his dream in the light of a warning
2044,VII.,"And made sudden plans for departure.  ""To go"
2045,VII.,"Is to fly from some folly,"" he said, ""for I know"
2046,VII.,"What salt air and dry wine, and the soft siren eyes"
2047,VII.,"Of a woman, can do under midsummer skies"
2048,VII.,With a man who is wretched as I am.  Unrest
2049,VII.,"Is a tramp, who goes picking the locks on one's breast"
2050,VII.,That a whole gang of vices may enter.  A thirst
2051,VII.,"For strong drink and chance games, those twin comrades accursed,"
2052,VII.,"Are already admitted.  Oh Mabel, my wife,"
2053,VII.,"Reach, reach out your arms, draw me into the life"
2054,VII.,"That alone is worth living.  I need you to-day,"
2055,VII.,"Have pity, and love me, oh love me, I pray."
2056,VII.,I will turn once again from the bad world to you.
2057,VII.,"Though false to myself, to my vows I am true."""
2058,VII.,
2059,VII.,When a soul strives to pull itself up out of sin
2060,VII.,The devil tries harder to push it back in.
2061,VII.,And the man who attempts to retrace the wrong track
2062,VII.,Needs his God and his will to stand close at his back.
2063,VII.,
2064,VII.,"Through what are called accidents, Roger was late"
2065,VII.,At the train.  Are not accidents servants of Fate?
2066,VII.,The first coach was filled; he passed on to the second.
2067,VII.,"That, too, seemed complete, but a gentleman beckoned"
2068,VII.,"And said, ""There's a seat, sir; the third from the last"
2069,VII.,"On your left.""  Roger thanked him and leisurely passed"
2070,VII.,"Down the aisle, with his coat on his arm, to the place"
2071,VII.,"Indicated.  The seat held a lady, whose face"
2072,VII.,"Was turned to the window.  ""Pray pardon me, miss"""
2073,VII.,"(For he judged by her back she was youthful), ""is this"
2074,VII.,"Seat engaged?""  As he spoke, the face turned in surprise,"
2075,VII.,"And Roger looked into the long, languid eyes"
2076,VII.,"Of La Travers.  She smiled, moved her wraps from the seat,"
2077,VII.,"And he sat down beside her.  The same subtle, sweet"
2078,VII.,"Breath of perfume exhaled from her presence, and made"
2079,VII.,The place seem a boudoir.  The deep winey shade
2080,VII.,"'Neath her eyes had grown larger, as if she had wept"
2081,VII.,"Or a late, lonely vigil with memory kept."
2082,VII.,
2083,VII.,A man who has rescued a woman from danger
2084,VII.,"Or death, does not seem to her wholly a stranger"
2085,VII.,When next she encounters him; yet both essayed
2086,VII.,To be formal and proper; and each of them made
2087,VII.,The effort a failure.  The jar of a train
2088,VII.,At times holds a mesmeric spell for the brain
2089,VII.,And a tense excitation for nerves; and the shriek
2090,VII.,Of the engine compels one to lean near to speak
2091,VII.,Or to list to his neighbor.  Formality flies
2092,VII.,With the smoke of the train and floats off to the skies.
2093,VII.,Roger led his companion to talk; and the theme
2094,VII.,"Which he chose, was herself, her life story.  The dream"
2095,VII.,Of the previous night was forgotten.  The charm
2096,VII.,Of the woman outweighed superstitious alarm.
2097,VII.,
2098,VII.,When the sunlight began to play peek-a-boo
2099,VII.,"Through the tunnels, which told them the journey was through,"
2100,VII.,Roger looked at his time-piece; the train for Bay Bend
2101,VII.,Left in just twenty minutes; but what a rude end
2102,VII.,To the day's pleasant comradeship--rushing away
2103,VII.,With a hurried good-bye!  He decided to stay
2104,VII.,Over night in the city.  He was not expected
2105,VII.,"At home.  Mrs. Travers was quite unprotected,"
2106,VII.,And almost a stranger in Gotham.  He ought
2107,VII.,"To see her safe into her doorway, he thought."
2108,VII.,"At the doorway she gave him her hand, with a smile;"
2109,VII.,"""I have known you,"" she said, ""such a brief little while,"
2110,VII.,Yet you seem like a friend of long standing; I say
2111,VII.,"Good-bye with reluctance."""
2112,VII.,
2113,VII.,"""Perhaps, then, I may"
2114,VII.,"Call and see you to-morrow?"" the words seemed to fall"
2115,VII.,Of themselves from his lips; words he longed to recall
2116,VII.,"When once uttered, for deep in his conscience he knew"
2117,VII.,"That the one word for him to speak now, was adieu."
2118,VII.,"The lady's soft, cushion-like hand rested still"
2119,VII.,"In his own, and the contact was pleasant.  A thrill"
2120,VII.,From the finger tips quickened his pulses.
2121,VII.,
2122,VII.,"""You may"
2123,VII.,"Call to-morrow at four."" The soft hand slipped away"
2124,VII.,And left his palm lonely.
2125,VII.,
2126,VII.,"""The call must be brief,"""
2127,VII.,"He said to himself, with a sense of relief,"
2128,VII.,"As he ran down the steps, ""for at five my train goes."""
2129,VII.,Yet the five o'clock train bore no Roger Montrose
2130,VII.,From New York.  Mrs. Travers had asked him to dine.
2131,VII.,"A tete-a-tete dinner with beauty and wine,"
2132,VII.,To stir the man's senses and deaden his brain.
2133,VII.,(The devil keeps always good chefs in his train.)
2134,VII.,It was ten when he rose for departure.  The room
2135,VII.,Seemed a garden of midsummer fragrance and bloom.
2136,VII.,The lights with their soft rosy coverings made
2137,VII.,"A glow like late sunsets, in some tropic glade."
2138,VII.,"The world seemed afar, with its dullness and duty,"
2139,VII.,And life was a rapture of love and of beauty.
2140,VII.,
2141,VII.,God knows how it happened; they never knew how.
2142,VII.,"He turned with a formal conventional bow,"
2143,VII.,"And some well chosen words of politeness, to go."
2144,VII.,Her mouth was a rose Love had dropped in the snow
2145,VII.,"Of her face.  It smiled up to him, luscious and sweet."
2146,VII.,"In the tip of each finger he felt his heart beat,"
2147,VII.,"Like five hearts all in one, as her hand touched his own."
2148,VII.,"She murmured ""good-night,"" in a tremulous tone."
2149,VII.,"White, intense, through the soft golden mist which the wine"
2150,VII.,"Had cast over his vision, he saw her face shine."
2151,VII.,Her low lidded eyes held a lion-like glow.
2152,VII.,You have seen sudden storms lash the ocean?  You know
2153,VII.,"How the cyclone, unheralded, rises in wrath,"
2154,VII.,And leaves devastation and death in its path?
2155,VII.,"So swift, sudden passion may rise in its power,"

2247,VIII.,What I must say.  The man has insulted your trust;
2248,VIII.,"He has dragged the most sacred of ties in the dust,"
2249,VIII.,"And ruined the fame of a woman who wore,"
2250,VIII.,"Until now, a good name.  He has gone.  Close the door"

2252,VIII.,"The sleuth hounds of justice were put on his track,"

2294,VIII.,A dead hope in their hearts.  The strange fancy clings

2304,VIII.,"The part of the patient, neglected young wife"

2306,VIII.,She was one of the women who live but to pose

2308,VIII.,That she really believed she was living the part.
2309,VIII.,The suffering martyr who makes no complaint

2314,VIII.,The ardent and love-selfish husband had not
2315,VIII.,"Been so dear to her heart, or so close to her thought,"

2318,VIII.,
2319,VIII.,"(How often, alas, the reformers of earth,"
2320,VIII.,"If they studied their purpose, would find it had birth"

2335,VIII.,"And the bald, ugly facts, unsuspected, unguessed,"
2336,VIII.,"Lay before her, the _woman_ awoke in her breast,"
2337,VIII.,"And the patient reformer gave way to the wife,"
2338,VIII.,Who was torn with resentment and jealousy's strife.
2339,VIII.,"Ah, jealousy! vain is the effort to prove"
2340,VIII.,Your right in the world as the offspring of love;

2346,VIII.,
2347,VIII.,No thought
2348,VIII.,Came to Mabel Montrose that her own life was not
2349,VIII.,"Free from blame.  (How few women, indeed, think of this"
2350,VIII.,When they grieve o'er the ruin of marital bliss!)
2351,VIII.,She was shocked and indignant.  Pain gave her a new
2352,VIII.,Role to play without study; she missed in her cue
2353,VIII.,"And played badly at first, was resentful and cried"
2354,VIII.,Against Fate for the blow it had dealt to her pride
2355,VIII.,"(Though she called it her love), and declared her life blighted."
2356,VIII.,"It is one thing, of course, for a wife to be slighted"
2357,VIII.,"For the average folly the world calls a sin,"
2358,VIII.,"Such as races, clubs, games; when a woman steps in"
2359,VIII.,"The matter assumes a new color, and Mabel,"
2360,VIII.,"Who dearly loved sinners, at first seemed unable"
2361,VIII.,"To pardon, or ask God to pardon, the crime"
2362,VIII.,Of her husband; an angry disgust for a time
2363,VIII.,"Drove all charity out of her heart.  For a thief,"
2364,VIII.,"For a forger, a murderer, even, her grief"
2365,VIII.,Had been mingled with pity and pardon; the one
2366,VIII.,Thing she could not forgive was the thing he had done.
2367,VIII.,"It was wicked, indecent, and so unrefined."
2368,VIII.,"To the lure of the senses her nature was blind,"
2369,VIII.,And her mantle of charity never had been

2381,VIII.,"Stealing back, masked demurely as friendly regard,"
2382,VIII.,The hope of a lover--that hope long debarred.
2383,VIII.,"His letters grew frequent; their tone, dignified,"
2384,VIII.,"Unselfish, and manly, appealed to her pride."
2385,VIII.,Sweet sympathy mingled with praise in each line
2386,VIII.,"(As a gentle narcotic is stirred into wine),"
2387,VIII.,"Soothed pain, stimulated self love, and restored her"
2388,VIII.,The pleasure of knowing the man still adored her.
2389,VIII.,
2390,VIII.,"Understand, Mabel Montrose was not a coquette,"
2391,VIII.,She lacked all the arts of the temptress; and yet
2392,VIII.,"She was young, she was feminine; love to her mind"
2393,VIII.,Was extreme admiration; it pleased her to find
2394,VIII.,"She was still, to Maurice, an ideal.  A woman"
2395,VIII.,"Must be quite unselfish, almost superhuman,"
2396,VIII.,"And full of strong sympathy, who, in her soul,"
2397,VIII.,Feels no wrench when she knows she has lost all control
2398,VIII.,O'er the heart of a man who once loved her.
2399,VIII.,
2400,VIII.,"Months passed,"
2401,VIII.,And Mabel accepted her burden at last
2402,VIII.,"And went back to her world and its duties.  Her eyes,"
2403,VIII.,"Seemed to say when she looked at you, ""please sympathize,"
2404,VIII.,On the slight graceful form or the beautiful face.
2405,VIII.,"Twas a sorrow of mind, not a sorrow of heart,"

2413,VIII.,"Of her ties, she might listen to all he would say."
2414,VIII.,"There was anguish, and doubt, and suspense in delay,"

2551,VIII.,"That dream, like full many another, must go."
2552,VIII.,The love that is based on attraction of sex
2553,VIII.,Is a love that has brought me but sorrow.  Why vex
2554,VIII.,My poor soul with the same thing again?  If you love
2555,VIII.,"With a higher emotion, you know how to prove"
2556,VIII.,"And sustain the assertion by conduct.  Maurice,"

2565,VIII.,"If not, I must say with this letter--adieu."
2566,VIII.,
2567,VIII.,As he finished the letter there seemed but one phrase
2568,VIII.,To the heart of the reader.  It shone on his gaze
2569,VIII.,"Bright with promise and hope.  ""_Too fresh is the taste"
2570,VIII.,Of its gall on my lip for my heart in such haste
2571,VIII.,"To reach out for the cup that is offered anew._"""
2572,VIII.,"""_In such haste._""  Ah, how hope into certainty grew"
2573,VIII.,"As he read and re-read that one sentence.  ""Let fate"
2574,VIII.,"Take the whole thing in charge, I can wait--I can wait."
2575,VIII.,I have lived through the night; though the dawn may be gray
2576,VIII.,"And belated, it heralds the coming of day."""
2577,VIII.,"So he talked with himself, and grew happy at last."
2578,VIII.,The five hopeless years of his sorrow were cast
2579,VIII.,Like a nightmare behind him.  He walked once again
2580,VIII.,"With a joy in his personal life, among men."
2581,VIII.,"There seemed to be always a smile on his lip,"
2582,VIII.,For he felt like a man on the deck of a ship
2583,VIII.,"Who has sailed through strange seas with a mutinous crew,"
2584,VIII.,And now in the distance sights land just in view.
2585,VIII.,
2586,VIII.,"The house at Bay Bend was re-opened.  Once more,"
2587,VIII.,"Where the waves of the Sound wash the New England shore,"
2588,VIII.,"Walked Maurice; and beside him, young hope, with the tip"
2589,VIII.,"Of his fair rosy fingers pressed hard on his lip,"
2590,VIII.,Urging silence.  If Mabel Montrose saw the boy
2591,VIII.,With the pursed prudent mouth and the eyes full of joy
2592,VIII.,"She said nothing.  Grave, dignified (Ah, but so fair!),"
2593,VIII.,There was naught in her modest and womanly air
2594,VIII.,To feed or encourage such hope.  Yet love grew
2595,VIII.,"Like an air plant, with only the night and the dew"
2596,VIII.,"To sustain it; while Mabel rejoiced in the friend,"
2597,VIII.,"Who, in spite of himself, had come back to Bay Bend,"
2598,VIII.,"Yielding all to her wishes.  Such people, alone,"
2599,VIII.,"Who gracefully gave up their plans for her own,"
2600,VIII.,"Were congenial to Mabel.  Though looking the sweet,"
2601,VIII.,"Fragile creature, with feminine virtues replete,"
2602,VIII.,Her nature was stubborn.  Beneath that fair brow
2603,VIII.,Lurked an obstinate purpose to make others bow
2604,VIII.,To herself in small matters.  She fully believed
2605,VIII.,"She was right, always right; and her friends were deceived,"
2606,VIII.,"As a rule, into thinking the same; for her eyes"
2607,VIII.,Held a look of such innocent grief and surprise
2608,VIII.,"When her will was opposed, that one felt her misused,"
2609,VIII.,"And retired from the field of dispute, self-accused."
2610,VIII.,
2611,VIII.,"The days, like glad children, went hurrying out"
2612,VIII.,From the schoolhouse of time; months pursued the same route
2613,VIII.,"More sedately; a year, then two years, passed away,"
2614,VIII.,"Yet hope, unimpaired, in the lover's heart lay,"
2615,VIII.,"As a gem in the bed of a river might lie,"
2616,VIII.,Unharmed and unmoved while its waters ran by.
2617,VIII.,"His toil for the poor still continued, but not"
2618,VIII.,With that fervor of zeal which a dominant thought
2619,VIII.,"Lends to labor.  Fair love gilded dreams filled his mind,"
2620,VIII.,While the corners were left for his suffering kind.
2621,VIII.,"He was sorry for sorrow; but love made him glad,"
2622,VIII.,And nothing in life now seemed hopeless or sad.
2623,VIII.,His tete-a-tete visits with Mabel were rare;
2624,VIII.,She ordered her life with such prudence and care
2625,VIII.,"Lest her white name be soiled by the gossips.  And yet,"
2626,VIII.,"Though his heart, like a steed checked too closely, would fret"
2627,VIII.,"Sometimes at these creed-imposed fetters, he felt"
2628,VIII.,Keen delight in her nearness; in knowing she dwelt
2629,VIII.,Within view of his high turret window.  Each day
2630,VIII.,"Which gave him a glimpse of her, love laid away"
2631,VIII.,As a poem in life's precious folio.  Night
2632,VIII.,"Held her face like a picture, dream-framed for his sight."
2633,VIII.,"So he fed on the crumbs from love's table, the while"
2634,VIII.,Fate sat looking on with a cynical smile.

3031,X.,"Whose modesty hung out red flags on each cheek,"
3032,X.,Danger signals--if some luckless boor chanced to speak
3033,X.,"The words ""leg"" or ""liver"" before you, I think"
3034,X.,"Your gray ashes, even, would deepen to pink"
3035,X.,Should your ghost happen into a clinic or college
3036,X.,Where your granddaughters congregate seeking for knowledge.
3037,X.,"Forced to listen to what they are eager to hear,"
3038,X.,"No doubt you would fancy the world out of gear,"
3039,X.,"And deem modesty dead, with last century belles."
3040,X.,
3041,X.,"Honored ghosts, you, would err! for true modesty dwells"
3042,X.,"In the same breast with knowledge, and takes no offense."
3043,X.,Truth never harmed anything yet but pretense.
3044,X.,
3045,X.,There are fashions in modesty; what in your time
3046,X.,Had been deemed little less than an absolute crime
3047,X.,"In matters of dress, or behavior, to-day"
3048,X.,Is the custom.  And however daring you may
3049,X.,"Deem our manners and modes, yet, were facts fully known,"
3050,X.,_Our morals compare very well with your own._
3051,X.,
3052,X.,The women composing the class at Bellevue
3053,X.,"Were young--under thirty; some pleasing to view,"
3054,X.,"Some plain.  Roman features prevailed, with brown hair,"
3055,X.,"But one was so feminine, soft eyed and fair"
3056,X.,"That she seemed out of place in a clinic, as though"
3057,X.,A rose in a vegetable garden should grow.
3058,X.,"While her face was intelligent, none would avow"
3059,X.,"That cold intellect dwelt on that fair oval brow,"
3060,X.,"Or looked out of the depths of those golden gray eyes,"
3061,X.,"The color of smoke against clear, sunny skies."
3062,X.,"'Twas a warm woman face, made for fireside nooks,"
3063,X.,Not a face to be bent over medical books.
3064,X.,There was nothing aggressive in features or form;
3065,X.,"She was meant for still harbors, and not for the storm"
3066,X.,And the strife of rude waters.  The swell of her breast
3067,X.,Suggested love's sweet downy cushion of rest
3068,X.,"For the cheeks of fair children.  Her plump little hands,"
3069,X.,Seemed fashioned for sewing small gussets and bands
3070,X.,"And fussing with laces and ribbons, instead"
3071,X.,Of cutting cold flesh and dissecting the dead.
3072,X.,"And yet, as a student she ranked with the first."
3073,X.,"But conscience, in labor once chosen, not thirst"
3074,X.,"For such knowledge, had spurred her to action.  This day"
3075,X.,"She seemed inattentive, her air was distrait,"
3076,X.,As if thought had slipped free of the bridle and rein
3077,X.,And galloped away over memory's plain.
3078,X.,
3079,X.,"It was true; it was strange, too, but there in the class,"
3080,X.,"While the learned man was talking, her mind seemed to pass"
3081,X.,"Out, away from the clinic, away from the town,"
3082,X.,To a New England midsummer garden close down
3083,X.,By the salt water's edge; and she felt the wind blowing
3084,X.,"Among her loose locks as she leaned o'er her sewing,"
3085,X.,While the voice of a man stirred her heart into song.
3086,X.,She was called from her dream by the clang of the gong
3087,X.,Which foretells an arrival at Bellevue.  The class
3088,X.,"Was dismissed for the day.  In the hall, forced to pass"
3089,X.,"By the stretcher (low brougham of misery), she"
3090,X.,"Whom we know was Ruth Somerville, looked down to see"
3091,X.,"The white, haggard face of the man whom her mind"
3092,X.,Had strayed off in a waking day vision to find
3093,X.,But a moment before.
3094,X.,
3095,X.,"The wild, passionate cry"
3096,X.,"Which arose in her heart, was held back, nor passed by"
3097,X.,"The white sentinels set on her lip.  The serene,"
3098,X.,Lofty look which deep feeling controlled gives the mien
3099,X.,Marked her air as she turned to the surgeon and said:
3100,X.,"""This man lying here, either dying or dead,"
3101,X.,"Was a classmate, at Yale, of my brother's; my friend"
3102,X.,"Is his wife.  Let me stay by his side to the end,"
3103,X.,"If the end has not come."""
3104,X.,
3105,X.,"It was Roger Montrose,"
3106,X.,"Grown old with his sins and grown gaunt with his woes,"
3107,X.,Lying low in his manhood before her.
3108,X.,
3109,X.,His eyes
3110,X.,Opened slowly; a wondering look of surprise
3111,X.,"Met the soft orbs above him.  ""Ruth--Ruth Somerville,"""
3112,X.,"He said feebly.  ""Tell Mabel""--then sighed, and was still."
3113,X.,
3114,X.,But it was not the stillness of death.  There was life
3115,X.,"In that turbulent heart yet; that heart torn with strife,"
3116,X.,"Scarred with passion, and wracked by the pangs of remorse."
3117,X.,"""Death's swift leaden messenger missed in its course"
3118,X.,"By the breadth of a hair,"" said the surgeon.  ""The ball"
3119,X.,Lies in there by the shoulder.  His chances are small
3120,X.,For a new start on earth.  While a sober man might
3121,X.,"Hope to conquer grim Death in this hand-to-hand fight,"
3122,X.,"Here old Alcohol stands as Death's second, fierce, cruel,"
3123,X.,"And stronger than Life's one aid, skill, in the duel."
3124,X.,You tell me the wife of this man is your friend?
3125,X.,"He was shot by a woman, who then made an end"
3126,X.,"Of her own life.  I hope it was not----"" ""Oh, no--no,"
3127,X.,"Not his wife,"" Ruth replied, ""for he left her to go"
3128,X.,"With this other, his victim--poor creature--they say"
3129,X.,She was good till she met him.  Ah! what a black way
3130,X.,"For love's rose scented path to lead down to, and end."
3131,X.,"God pity her, pity her.""  ""Her, not your friend?"
3132,X.,"Not his wife?"""
3133,X.,
3134,X.,There was gentle reproof in the tone
3135,X.,Of the staid old physician.  Ruth's eyes met his own
3136,X.,"In brave, silent warfare; the blue and the gray"
3137,X.,Again faced each other in battle array.
3138,X.,
3139,X.,_Ruth:_
3140,X.,
3141,X.,I pity the woman who suffered.  His wife
3142,X.,Goes her way well contented.  Love was in her life
3143,X.,"But an incident; while to this other, dear God,"
3144,X.,"It was all; on what sharp, burning ploughshares she trod,"
3145,X.,"Down what chasms she leaped, how she tossed the whole world,"
3146,X.,"Like a dead rose, behind her, to lie and be whirled"
3147,X.,"In the maelstrom of love for one moment.  Ah, brief"
3148,X.,"Is the rapture such souls find, and long is their grief,"
3149,X.,"Black their sin, blurred their record, and scarlet their shame."
3150,X.,"And yet when I think of them, sorrow, not blame,"
3151,X.,Stirs my being.  Blind passion is only the weed
3152,X.,"Of fair, beautiful love.  Both are sprung from one seed;"
3153,X.,"One grows wild, one is trained and directed.  Condemn"
3154,X.,The hand that neglected--but ah! pity _them_.
3155,X.,
3156,X.,_Surgeon:_
3157,X.,
3158,X.,"You speak with much feeling.  But now, if the friends"
3159,X.,Of this man are to see him before his life ends
3160,X.,I recommend action on your part.  His stay
3161,X.,"On this planet, I fear, will be finished to-day."
3162,X.,"A man who neglects and abuses his wife,"
3163,X.,"Who gives her at best but the dregs of his life,"
3164,X.,"In the hey day of health, when he's drained his last cup"
3165,X.,Has a fashion of wanting to settle things up.
3166,X.,"Craves forgiveness, and hopes with a few final tears"
3167,X.,To wash out the sins and the insults of years.
3168,X.,"Call your friend; bid her hasten, lest lips that are dumb,"
3169,X.,"Having wasted life's feast, shall refuse her death's crumb."
3170,X.,
3171,X.,_Ruth:_
3172,X.,
3173,X.,"There are souls to whom crumbs are sufficient, at least"
3174,X.,They seem not to value love's opulent feast.
3175,X.,"They neglect, they ignore, they abuse, or destroy"
3176,X.,What to some poor starved life had been earth's rarest joy.
3177,X.,'Tis a curious fact that love's banqueting table
3178,X.,Full often is spread for the guest the least able
3179,X.,To do the feast justice.  The gods take delight
3180,X.,In offering crusts to the starved appetite
3181,X.,"And rich fruits, to the sated or sickly."
3182,X.,
3183,X.,The eyes
3184,X.,Of the surgeon were fixed on Ruth's face with a wise
3185,X.,"Knowing look in their depths, and he said to himself,"
3186,X.,"""There's a mystery here which young Cupid, sly elf,"
3187,X.,Could account for.  I judge by her voice and her face
3188,X.,That the wife of this man holds no very warm place
3189,X.,"In Miss Somerville's heart, though she names her as friend."
3190,X.,"Ah, full many a drama has come to an end"
3191,X.,"'Neath the walls of Bellevue, and the curtain will fall"
3192,X.,"On one actor to-night; though the audience call,"
3193,X.,"He will make no response, once he passes from view,"
3194,X.,"For Death is the prompter who gives him the cue."""
3195,X.,
3196,X.,The wisest minds err.  When a clergyman tries
3197,X.,"To tell a man where he will go when he dies,"
3198,X.,Or when a physician makes bold to aver
3199,X.,"Just the length of a life here, both usually err."
3200,X.,"So it is not surprising that Roger, at dawn,"
3201,X.,"Sat propped up by pillows, still haggard and wan,"
3202,X.,"But seemingly stronger, and eager to tell"
3203,X.,His story to Ruth ere the death shadows fell.
3204,X.,
3205,X.,"""If I go before Mabel can reach me,"" he sighed,"
3206,X.,"""Tell her this: that my heart was all hers when I died,"
3207,X.,"Was all hers while I lived.  Ah!  I see how you start,"
3208,X.,"But that other--God pity her--not with my heart,"
3209,X.,But my sensual senses I loved her.  The fire
3210,X.,Of her glance blinded men to all things save desire.
3211,X.,It called to the beast chained within us.  Her lips
3212,X.,Held the nectar that makes a man mad when he sips.
3213,X.,Her touch was delirium.  In the fierce joys
3214,X.,Of her kisses there lurked the fell curse which destroys
3215,X.,"All such rapture--satiety.  When passion dies,"
3216,X.,"And the mind finds no pleasure, the spirit no ties"
3217,X.,"To replace it, disgust digs its grave.  Ay! disgust"
3218,X.,Is ever the sexton who buries dead lust.
3219,X.,
3220,X.,"When two people wander from virtue's straight track,"
3221,X.,One always grows weary and longs to go back.
3222,X.,"Well, I wearied.  God knows how I struggled to hide"
3223,X.,"The truth from the poor, erring soul at my side."
3224,X.,And God knows how I hated my life when I first
3225,X.,Found that passion's mad potion had palled on my thirst.
3226,X.,"Once false to my virtues, now false to my sin,"
3227,X.,I seemed less to myself than I ever had been.
3228,X.,We parted.  This bullet hole here in my breast
3229,X.,Proceeds with the story and tells you the rest.
3230,X.,"She smiled, I remember, in saying adieu:"
3231,X.,"Then two swift, sharp reports--and I woke in Bellevue"
3232,X.,With one ball in my breast.
3233,X.,
3234,X.,_Ruth:_
3235,X.,
3236,X.,And the other in hers.
3237,X.,No more with wild sorrow that sad bosom stirs.
3238,X.,"She is dead, sir, the woman you led to her ruin."
3239,X.,
3240,X.,_Roger:_
3241,X.,
3242,X.,The woman led me.  Ah! not all the undoing
3243,X.,In these matters lies at man's door.  In the mind
3244,X.,Of full many a so-called chaste woman we find
3245,X.,Unchaste longings.  The world heaps on man its abuse
3246,X.,When he woos without wedding; yet women seduce
3247,X.,And betray us; they lure us and lead us to shame;
3248,X.,"As they share in the sin, let them share in the blame."
3249,X.,
3250,X.,_Ruth:_
3251,X.,
3252,X.,Hush! the woman is dead.
3253,X.,
3254,X.,_Roger:_
3255,X.,
3256,X.,And I dying.  But truth
3257,X.,"Is not changed by the death of two people!  Oh, Ruth,"
3258,X.,Be just ere you judge me! the death of my child
3259,X.,"Half unbalanced my reason; weak, wretched and wild"
3260,X.,"With drink and with sorrows, the devil's own chance"
3261,X.,Flung me down by the side of a woman whose glance
3262,X.,"Was an opiate, lulling the conscience.  I fell,"
3263,X.,"With the woman who tempted me, down to dark hell."
3264,X.,In the honey of sin hides the sting of the bee.
3265,X.,The honey soon sated--the sting stayed with me.
3266,X.,"Like a damned soul I looked from my Hades, above"
3267,X.,"To the world I had left, and I craved the pure love"
3268,X.,"That but late had seemed cold, unresponsive.  Her eyes,"
3269,X.,"Mabel's eyes, shone in dreams from the far distant skies"
3270,X.,Of the lost world of goodness and virtue.  Like one
3271,X.,"Who is burning with thirst 'neath a hot desert sun,"
3272,X.,"I longed for her kiss, cool, reluctant, but pure."
3273,X.,"Ah! man's love for good women alone can endure,"
3274,X.,"For virtue is God, the Eternal.  The rest"
3275,X.,Is but chaos.  The worst must give way to the best.
3276,X.,"Tell Mabel--Ruth, Ruth, she is here, oh thank God."
3277,X.,
3278,X.,"She stood, like a violet sprung from the sod,"
3279,X.,"By his bedside; pale, beautiful, dewy with tears."
3280,X.,The spectre of death bridged the chasm of years:
3281,X.,"He sighed on her bosom.  ""Forgive, oh forgive!"""
3282,X.,"She kissed his pale forehead and answered him: ""Live,"
3283,X.,"Live, my husband! oh plead with the angels to stay"
3284,X.,"Until God, too, has pardoned your sins.  Let us pray."""
3285,X.,
3286,X.,Ruth slipped from the room all unnoticed.  She seemed
3287,X.,Like a sleeper who wakens and knows he has dreamed
3288,X.,"And is dazed with reality.  On, as if led"
3289,X.,"By some presence unseen, to the inn of the dead"
3290,X.,She passed swiftly; the pale silent guest whom she sought
3291,X.,Lay alone on her narrow and unadorned cot.
3292,X.,No hand had placed blossoms about her; no tear
3293,X.,Of love or of sorrow had hallowed that bier.
3294,X.,The desperate smile life had left on her face
3295,X.,"Death retained; but he touched, too, her brow with a grace"
3296,X.,"And a radiance, subtle, mysterious.  Under"
3297,X.,"The half drooping lids lay a look of strange wonder,"
3298,X.,As if on the sight of those sorrowing eyes
3299,X.,The unexplored country had dawned with surprise.
3300,X.,
3301,X.,"The pure, living woman leaned over the dead,"
3302,X.,"Lovely sinner, and kissed her.  ""God rest you,"" she said."
3303,X.,"""Poor suffering soul, you were forged in that Source"
3304,X.,"Where the lightnings are fashioned.  Love guided, your force"
3305,X.,"Would have been like a current of life giving joys,"
3306,X.,And not like the death dealing bolt which destroys.
3307,X.,"Oh, shame to the parents who dared give you birth,"
3308,X.,"To live and to love and to suffer on earth,"
3309,X.,"With the serious lessons of life unexplained,"
3310,X.,And your passionate nature untaught and untrained.
3311,X.,You would not lie here in your youth and your beauty
3312,X.,If your mother had known what was motherhood's duty.
3313,X.,"The age calls to woman, ""Go, broaden your lives,"""
3314,X.,While for lack of good mothers the Potter's Field thrives.
3315,X.,"But you, poor unfortunate, you shall not lie"
3316,X.,In that dust heap of death; while the summers roll by
3317,X.,"You shall sleep where green hillsides are kissed by the wave,"
3318,X.,And the soft hand of pity shall care for your grave.

3326,XI.,
3327,XI.,"The springtime is here in our old home again,"
3328,XI.,"Which again you have left.  Oh, most worthy of men,"
3329,XI.,Why grieve for unworthiness?  Why waste your life
3330,XI.,For a woman who never was meant for a wife?
3331,XI.,Mabel Lee has no love in her nature.  Your heart
3332,XI.,"Would have starved in her keeping.  She plays her new part,"
3333,XI.,"As the faithful, forgiving, sweet spouse, with content."
3334,XI.,I think she is secretly glad Roger went
3335,XI.,Astray for a season.  She stands up still higher
3336,XI.,"On her pedestal, now, for Bay Bend to admire."
3337,XI.,"She is pleased with herself.  As for Roger, he trots"
3338,XI.,"Like a lamb in her wake, with the blemishing spots"
3339,XI.,Of his sins washed away by the Church.  Oh I seem
3340,XI.,"To myself, in these days, like one waked from a dream"
3341,XI.,To blessed reality.  Off in the Bay
3342,XI.,I saw a fair snowy sailed ship yesterday.
3343,XI.,"The masts shone like gold, and the furrowed waves laughed,"
3344,XI.,To be beat into foam by the beautiful craft.
3345,XI.,But close in the harbor I saw the ship lying;
3346,XI.,"What seemed like the wings of a sea gull when flying,"
3347,XI.,"Were weather stained sheets; there were no masts of gold,"
3348,XI.,"And the craft was uncleanly, unseaworthy, old."
3349,XI.,"Well, the man whom I loved, and loved vainly, and whom"
3350,XI.,"I fancied had shadowed my whole life with gloom,"
3351,XI.,"Has been shown to my sight like that ship in the Bay,"
3352,XI.,And all my illusions have vanished away.
3353,XI.,"The man is by nature weak, selfish, unstable."
3354,XI.,"I think if some woman more loving than Mabel,"
3355,XI.,"More tender, more tactful, less painfully good,"
3356,XI.,"Had directed his home-life, perchance Roger would"
3357,XI.,"Have evolved his best self, that pure atom of God,"
3358,XI.,Which lies deep in each heart like a seed in the sod.
3359,XI.,"'Tis the world's over-virtuous women, ofttimes,"
3360,XI.,Who drive men of weak will into sexual crimes.
3361,XI.,"I pity him.  (God knows I pity, each, all"
3362,XI.,Of the poor striving souls who grope blindly and fall
3363,XI.,By the wayside of life.)  But the love which unbidden
3364,XI.,"Crept into my heart, and was guarded and hidden"
3365,XI.,"For years, that has vanished.  It passed like a breath,"
3366,XI.,"In the gray Autumn morning when Roger faced death,"
3367,XI.,"As he thought, and uncovered his heart to my sight."
3368,XI.,"Like a corpse, resurrected and brought to the light,"
3369,XI.,"Which crumbles to ashes, the love of my youth"
3370,XI.,"Crumbled off into nothingness.  Ah, it is truth;"
3371,XI.,"Love can die!  You may hold it is not the true thing,"
3372,XI.,"Not the genuine passion, which dies or takes wing;"
3373,XI.,"But the soil of the heart, like the soil of the earth,"
3374,XI.,"May, at varying times of the seasons, give birth"
3375,XI.,"To bluebells, and roses, and bright goldenrod."
3376,XI.,"Each one is a gift from the garden of God,"
3377,XI.,Though it dies when its season is over.  Why cling
3378,XI.,To the withered dead stalk of the blossoms of spring
3379,XI.,"Through a lifetime, Maurice?  It is stubbornness only,"
3380,XI.,"Not constancy, which makes full many lives lonely."
3381,XI.,"They want their own way, and, like cross children, fling"
3382,XI.,"Back the gifts which, in place of the lost flowers of spring,"
3383,XI.,Fate offers them.  Life holds in store for you yet
3384,XI.,"Better things, dear Maurice, than a dead violet,"
3385,XI.,As it holds better things than dead daisies for me.
3386,XI.,"To Roger Montrose, let us leave Mabel Lee,"
3387,XI.,With our blessing.  They seem to be happy; or she

3389,XI.,"Has the look of one who, overfed with emotion,"
3390,XI.,"Tries a diet of spiritual health-food, devotion."

3393,XI.,He has time now to worship his God and his wife.
3394,XI.,She seems better pleased with the dregs of his life
3395,XI.,Than she was with the bead of it.
3396,XI.,
3397,XI.,"Well, let them make"
3398,XI.,"What they will of their future.  Maurice, for my sake"
3399,XI.,"And your own, put them out of your thoughts.  All too brief"
3400,XI.,And too broad is this life to be ruined by grief
3401,XI.,"Over one human atom.  Like mellowing rain,"
3402,XI.,"Which enriches the soil of the soul and the brain,"
3403,XI.,Should the sorrow of youth be; and not like the breath
3404,XI.,"Of the cyclone, which carries destruction and death."
3405,XI.,"Come, Maurice, let philosophy lift you above"
3406,XI.,The gloom and despair of unfortunate love.
3407,XI.,"Sometimes, if we look a woe straight in the face,"
3408,XI.,It loses its terrors and seems commonplace;
3409,XI.,While sorrow will follow and find if we roam.
3410,XI.,"Come, help me to turn the old house into home."
3411,XI.,"We have youth, health, and competence.  Why should we go"
3412,XI.,Out into God's world with long faces of woe?
3413,XI.,"Let our pleasures have speech, let our sorrows be dumb,"
3414,XI.,Let us laugh at despair and contentment will come.

3416,XI.,For the world needs the happy far more than the wise.
3417,XI.,I am one of the women whose talent and taste
3418,XI.,Lie in home-making.  All else I do seems mere waste

3425,XI.,"You will write, and your great heart athrob through your pen"
3426,XI.,Shall strengthen earth's weak ones with courage again.
3427,XI.,"Where your epigrams fail, I will offer a pill,"
3428,XI.,"And doctor their bodies with ""new woman"" skill."
3429,XI.,"(Once a wife, I will drop from my name the M. D."
3430,XI.,I hold it the truth that no woman can be
3431,XI.,"An excellent wife and an excellent mother,"
3432,XI.,And leave enough purpose and time for another
3433,XI.,Profession outside.  And our sex was not made
3434,XI.,To jostle with men in the great marts of trade.
3435,XI.,"The wage-earning women, who talk of their sphere,"
3436,XI.,Have thrown the domestic machine out of gear.
3437,XI.,They point to their fast swelling ranks overjoyed;
3438,XI.,Forgetting the army of men unemployed.
3439,XI.,
3440,XI.,"The banner of Feminine ""Rights,"" when unfurled,"
3441,XI.,Means a flag of distress to the rest of the world.
3442,XI.,"And poor Cupid, depressed by such follies and crimes,"
3443,XI.,"Sits weeping, alone, in the Land of Hard Times."
3444,XI.,"The world needs wise mothers, the world needs good wives,"
3445,XI.,"The world needs good homes, and yet woman strives"
3446,XI.,To be everything else but domestic.  God's plan
3447,XI.,"Was for woman to rule the whole world, _through a man_."
3448,XI.,There is nothing a woman of sweetness and tact
3449,XI.,Can not do without personal effort or act.
3450,XI.,"She needs but infuse lover, husband or son"
3451,XI.,"With her own subtle spirit, and lo! it is done."
3452,XI.,"Though the man is unconscious, full oft, of the cause,"
3453,XI.,And fancies himself the sole maker of laws.
3454,XI.,"Well, let him.  The cannon, no doubt, is the prouder"
3455,XI.,For not knowing its noise is produced by the powder.
3456,XI.,"Yet this is the law: _Who can love, can command_.)"
3457,XI.,"But I wander too far from the subject in hand,"
3458,XI.,"Which is, your home coming.  Make haste, dear; I find"
3459,XI.,More need every day of your counseling mind.
3460,XI.,"I work well in harness, but poorly alone."
3461,XI.,"Until that bright day when Fate brings us our own,"
3462,XI.,"Let us labor together.  I see many ways,"
3463,XI.,"Many tasks, for the use of our talents and days."
3464,XI.,"Your wisdom shall better the workingmen's lives,"
3465,XI.,"While I will look after their daughters and wives,"
3466,XI.,"And teach them to cook without waste; for, indeed,"
3467,XI.,"It is knowledge like this which the poor people need,"
3468,XI.,"Not the stuff taught in schools.  You shall help them to think,"
3469,XI.,While I show them what they can eat and can drink
3470,XI.,"With least cost, and most pleasure and benefit.  Please"
3471,XI.,"Write me and say you will come, dear Maurice."
3472,XI.,"Home, sister, and duty are all waiting here;"
3473,XI.,Who keeps close to duty finds pleasure dwells near.

3480,XII.,_Maurice's Letter to Ruth:_
3481,XII.,
3482,XII.,"No, no.  I have gambled with destiny twice,"
3483,XII.,And have staked my whole hopes on a home; but the dice
3484,XII.,"Thrown by Fate made me loser.  Henceforward, I know"
3485,XII.,My lot must be homeless.  The gods will it so.
3486,XII.,
3487,XII.,"I fought, I rebelled; I was bitter.  I strove"
3488,XII.,"To outwit the great Cosmic Forces, above,"
3489,XII.,"Or beyond, or about us, who guide and control"
3490,XII.,The course of all things from the moat to the soul.
3491,XII.,
3492,XII.,"The river may envy the peace of the pond,"
3493,XII.,But law drives it out to the ocean beyond.
3494,XII.,"If it roars down abysses, or laughs through the land,"
3495,XII.,It follows the way which the Forces have planned.
3496,XII.,
3497,XII.,So man is directed.  His only the choice
3498,XII.,To help or to hinder--to weep or rejoice.
3499,XII.,"But vain is refusal--and vain discontent,"
3500,XII.,For at last he must walk in the way that was meant.
3501,XII.,
3502,XII.,"My way leads through shadow, alone to the end"
3503,XII.,"I must work out my karma, and follow its trend."
3504,XII.,"I must fulfill the purpose, whatever it be,"
3505,XII.,And look not for peace till I merge in God's sea.
3506,XII.,
3507,XII.,"Though bankrupt in joy, still my life has its gain;"
3508,XII.,I have climbed the last round in the ladder of pain.
3509,XII.,There is nothing to dread.  I have drained sorrow's cup
3510,XII.,And can laugh as I fling it at Fate bottom up.
3511,XII.,
3512,XII.,I have missed what I sought; yet I missed not the whole.
3513,XII.,The best part of love is in loving.  My soul
3514,XII.,"Is enriched by its prodigal gifts.  Still, to give"
3515,XII.,"And to ask no return, is my lot while I live."
3516,XII.,
3517,XII.,"Such love may be blindness, but where are love's eyes?"
3518,XII.,"Such love may be folly, love seldom is wise."
3519,XII.,"Such love may be madness, was love ever sane?"
3520,XII.,"Such love must be sorrow, for all love is pain."
3521,XII.,
3522,XII.,"Love goes where it must go, and in its own season."
3523,XII.,Love cannot be banished by will or by reason.
3524,XII.,"Love gave back your freedom, it keeps me its slave."
3525,XII.,"I shall walk in its fetters, unloved, to my grave."
3526,XII.,
3527,XII.,"So be it.  What right has the ant, in the dust,"
3528,XII.,"To cry that the world is all wrong, and unjust,"
3529,XII.,Because the swift foot of a messenger trod
3530,XII.,"Down the home, and the hopes, that were built in the sod?"
3531,XII.,
3532,XII.,"What is man but an ant, in this universe scheme?"
3533,XII.,"Though dear his ambition, and precious his dream,"
3534,XII.,"God's messengers speed all unseen on their way,"
3535,XII.,And the plans of a lifetime go down in a day.
3536,XII.,
3537,XII.,"No matter.  The aim of the Infinite mind,"
3538,XII.,"Which lies back of it all, must be great, must be kind."
3539,XII.,"Can the ant or the man, though ingenious and wise,"
3540,XII.,Swing the tides of the sea--set a star in the skies?
3541,XII.,
3542,XII.,"Can man fling a million of worlds into space,"
3543,XII.,To whirl on their orbits with system and grace?
3544,XII.,"Can he color a sunset, or create a seed,"
3545,XII.,Or fashion one leaf of the commonest weed?
3546,XII.,
3547,XII.,"Can man summon daylight, or bid the night fall?"
3548,XII.,Then how dare he question the Force which does all?
3549,XII.,"Where so much is flawless, where so much is grand,"
3550,XII.,"All, all must be right, could our souls understand."
3551,XII.,
3552,XII.,"Ah, man, the poor egotist!  Think with what pride"
3553,XII.,He boasts his small knowledge of star and of tide.
3554,XII.,"But when fortune fails him, or when a hope dies,"
3555,XII.,The Maker of stars and of seas he denies!
3556,XII.,
3557,XII.,"I questioned, I doubted.  But that is all past;"
3558,XII.,I have learned the true secret of living at last.
3559,XII.,"It is, to accept what Fate sends, and to know"
3560,XII.,That the one thing God wishes of man--is to grow.
3561,XII.,
3562,XII.,"Growth, growth out of self, back to him--the First Cause:"
3563,XII.,"Therein lies the purpose, the law of all laws."
3564,XII.,"Tears, grief, disappointment, well, what are all these"
3565,XII.,To the Builder of stars and the Maker of seas?
3566,XII.,
3567,XII.,"Does the star long to shine, when He tells it to set,"
3568,XII.,As the heart would remember when told to forget?
3569,XII.,"Does the sea moan for flood tide, when bid to be low,"
3570,XII.,As a soul cries for pleasure when given life's woe?
3571,XII.,
3572,XII.,"In the Antarctic regions a volcano glows,"
3573,XII.,While low at its base lie the up-reaching snows.
3574,XII.,"With patient persistence they steadily climb,"
3575,XII.,And the flame will be quenched in the passage of time.
3576,XII.,
3577,XII.,"My heart is the crater, my will is the snow,"
3578,XII.,Which yet may extinguish its volcanic glow.
3579,XII.,"When self is once conquered, the end comes to pain,"
3580,XII.,And that is the goal which I seek to attain.
3581,XII.,
3582,XII.,"I seek it in work, heaven planned, heaven sent;"
3583,XII.,In the kingdom of toil waits the crown of content.
3584,XII.,"Work, work! ah, how high and divine was its birth,"
3585,XII.,"When God, the first laborer, fashioned the earth."
3586,XII.,
3587,XII.,"The world cries for workers; not toilers for pelf,"
3588,XII.,But souls who have sought to eliminate self.
3589,XII.,Can the lame lead the race?  Can the blind guide the blind?
3590,XII.,We must better ourselves ere we better our kind.
3591,XII.,
3592,XII.,"There are wrongs to be righted; and first of them all,"
3593,XII.,Is to lift up the leaners from Charity's thrall.
3594,XII.,"Sweet, wisdomless Charity, sowing the seed"
3595,XII.,"Which it seeks to uproot, of dependence and need."
3596,XII.,
3597,XII.,For vain is the effort to give man content
3598,XII.,"By clothing his body, by paying his rent."
3599,XII.,"The garment re-tatters, the rent day recurs;"
3600,XII.,Who seeks to serve God by such charity errs.
3601,XII.,
3602,XII.,"Give light to the spirit, give strength to the mind,"
3603,XII.,"And the body soon cares for itself, you will find."
3604,XII.,"First, faith in God's wisdom, then purpose and will,"
3605,XII.,"And, like mist before sunlight, shall vanish each ill."
3606,XII.,
3607,XII.,To the far realm of Wisdom there lies a short way.
3608,XII.,To find it we need but the password--Obey.
3609,XII.,"Obey like the acorn that falls to the sod,"
3610,XII.,"To rise, through the heart of the oak tree, to God."
3611,XII.,
3612,XII.,"Though slow be the rising, and distant the goal,"
3613,XII.,Serenity waits at the end for each soul.
3614,XII.,"I seek it.  Not backward, but onward I go,"
3615,XII.,"And since sorrow means growth, I will welcome my woe."
3616,XII.,
3617,XII.,"In the ladder of lives we are given to climb,"
3618,XII.,Each life counts for only a second of time.
3619,XII.,"The one thing to do in the brief little space,"
3620,XII.,Is to make the world glad that we ran in the race.
3621,XII.,
3622,XII.,No soul should be sad whom the Maker deemed worth
3623,XII.,The great gift of song as its dower at birth.
3624,XII.,"While I pass on my way, an invisible throng"
3625,XII.,Breathes low in my ear the new note of a song.
3626,XII.,
3627,XII.,So I am not alone; for by night and by day
3628,XII.,These mystical messengers people my way.
3629,XII.,"They bid me to hearken, they bid me be dumb"
3630,XII.,And to wait for the true inspiration to come.
