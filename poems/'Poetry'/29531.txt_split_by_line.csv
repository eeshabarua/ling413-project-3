132,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.
133,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,
134,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,AN ingenuous reviewer once described some verses of mine as
135,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"“unwholesome,” because, he said, they had “a faint smell of Patchouli"
136,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"about them.” I am a little sorry he chose Patchouli, for that is not a"
137,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,particularly favourite scent with me. If he had only chosen Peau
138,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"d’Espagne, which has a subtle meaning, or Lily of the Valley, with"
139,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"which I have associations! But Patchouli will serve. Let me ask, then,"
140,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"in republishing, with additions, a collection of little pieces, many of"
141,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"which have been objected to, at one time or another, as being somewhat"
142,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"deliberately frivolous, why art should not, if it please, concern"
143,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"itself with the artificially charming, which, I suppose, is what my"
144,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"critic means by Patchouli? All art, surely, is a form of artifice, and"
145,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"thus, to the truly devout mind, condemned already, if not as actively"
146,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"noxious, at all events as needless. That is a point of view which I"
147,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"quite understand, and its conclusion I hold to be absolutely logical. I"
148,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"have the utmost respect for the people who refuse to read a novel, to"
149,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"go to the theatre, or to learn dancing. That is to have convictions and"
150,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,to live up to them. I understand also the point of view from which a
151,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,work of art is tolerated in so far as it is actually militant on behalf
152,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,of a religious or a moral idea. But what I fail to understand are those
153,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"delicate, invisible degrees by which a distinction is drawn between"
154,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"this form of art and that; the hesitations, and compromises, and"
155,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"timorous advances, and shocked retreats, of the Puritan conscience once"
156,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"emancipated, and yet afraid of liberty. However you may try to convince"
157,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"yourself to the contrary, a work of art can be judged only from two"
158,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,standpoints: the standpoint from which its art is measured entirely by
159,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"its morality, and the standpoint from which its morality is measured"
160,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,entirely by its art.
161,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,
162,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"Here, for once, in connection with these “Silhouettes,” I have not, if"
163,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"my recollection serves me, been accused of actual immorality. I am but"
164,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"a fair way along the “primrose path,” not yet within singeing distance"
165,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"of the “everlasting bonfire.” In other words, I have not yet written"
166,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"“London Nights,” which, it appears (I can scarcely realize it, in my"
167,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"innocent abstraction in aesthetical matters), has no very salutary"
168,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"reputation among the blameless moralists of the press. I need not,"
169,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"therefore, on this occasion, concern myself with more than the curious"
170,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,fallacy by which there is supposed to be something inherently wrong in
171,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,artistic work which deals frankly and lightly with the very real charm
172,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,of the lighter emotions and the more fleeting sensations.
173,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,
174,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,I do not wish to assert that the kind of verse which happened to
175,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"reflect certain moods of mine at a certain period of my life, is the"
176,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"best kind of verse in itself, or is likely to seem to me, in other"
177,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"years, when other moods may have made me their own, the best kind of"
178,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,verse for my own expression of myself. Nor do I affect to doubt that
179,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,the creation of the supreme emotion is a higher form of art than the
180,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"reflection of the most exquisite sensation, the evocation of the most"
181,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,magical impression. I claim only an equal liberty for the rendering of
182,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,every mood of that variable and inexplicable and contradictory creature
183,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"which we call ourselves, of every aspect under which we are gifted or"
184,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,condemned to apprehend the beauty and strangeness and curiosity of the
185,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,visible world.
186,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,
187,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"Patchouli! Well, why not Patchouli? Is there any “reason in nature” why"
188,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"we should write exclusively about the natural blush, if the delicately"
189,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"acquired blush of rouge has any attraction for us? Both exist; both, I"
190,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"think, are charming in their way; and the latter, as a subject, has, at"
191,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"all events, more novelty. If you prefer your “new-mown hay” in the"
192,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"hayfield, and I, it may be, in a scent-bottle, why may not my"
193,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,individual caprice be allowed to find expression as well as yours?
194,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,Probably I enjoy the hayfield as much as you do; but I enjoy quite
195,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"other scents and sensations as well, and I take the former for granted,"
196,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"and write my poem, for a change, about the latter. There is no"
197,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,necessary difference in artistic value between a good poem about a
198,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,flower in the hedge and a good poem about the scent in a sachet. I am
199,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,always charmed to read beautiful poems about nature in the country.
200,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"Only, personally, I prefer town to country; and in the town we have to"
201,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"find for ourselves, as best we may, the _décor_ which is the town"
202,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,equivalent of the great natural _décor_ of fields and hills. Here it is
203,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,that artificiality comes in; and if any one sees no beauty in the
204,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"effects of artificial light, in all the variable, most human, and yet"
205,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"most factitious town landscape, I can only pity him, and go on my own"
206,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,way.
207,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,
208,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"That is, if he will let me. But he tells me that one thing is right and"
209,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,the other is wrong; that one is good art and the other is bad; and I
210,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"listen in amazement, sometimes not without impatience, wondering why an"
211,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"estimable personal prejudice should be thus exalted into a dogma, and"
212,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"uttered in the name of art. For in art there can be no prejudices, only"
213,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"results. If we arc to save people’s souls by the writing of verses,"
214,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"well and good. But if not, there is no choice but to admit an absolute"
215,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"freedom of choice. And if Patchouli pleases one, why not Patchouli?"
