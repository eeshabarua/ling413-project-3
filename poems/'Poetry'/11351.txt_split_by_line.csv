43,,
44,,
45,,A friend has objected to the title of this book
46,,"on the ground that, as many of the characters"
47,,and scenes described are to be found in almost
48,,"any coast village of the United States, the title might,"
49,,"with equal fitness, be ""New Jersey Ballads,"" or ""Long"
50,,"Island Ballads,"" or something similar."
51,,
52,,"The answer to this is, simply, that while ""School-committee"
53,,"Men"" and ""Village Oracles"" are, doubtless,"
54,,"pretty much alike throughout Yankeedom, the"
55,,particular specimens here dealt with were individuals
56,,"whom the author knew in his boyhood ""down on the"
57,,"Cape."" So, ""Cape Cod Ballads"" it is."
58,,
59,,The verses in this collection originally appeared in
60,,"_Harper's Weekly, The Youth's Companion, The Saturday"
61,,"Evening Post, Puck, Types, The League of American"
62,,"Wheelmen Bulletin_, and the publications of the American"
63,,Press Association. Thanks are due to the editors
64,,of these periodicals for their courteous permission

459,THE WIND'S SONG,"Light and low, that mother's song;"
460,THE WIND'S SONG,"And the master, staunch and strong,"
461,THE WIND'S SONG,Heard the sweet strain drift along--
462,THE WIND'S SONG,"Softened, thinned,--"
463,THE WIND'S SONG,Heard the tightened cordage ringing
464,THE WIND'S SONG,Till it seemed a loved voice singing

473,THE LIFE-SAVER,
474,THE LIFE-SAVER,"When the Lord breathes his wrath above the bosom of the waters,"
475,THE LIFE-SAVER,"When the rollers are a-poundin' on the shore,"
476,THE LIFE-SAVER,"When the mariner's a-thinkin' of his wife and sons and daughters,"
477,THE LIFE-SAVER,"And the little home he'll, maybe, see no more;"
478,THE LIFE-SAVER,"When the bars are white and yeasty and the shoals are all a-frothin',"
479,THE LIFE-SAVER,When the wild no'theaster's cuttin' like a knife;
480,THE LIFE-SAVER,"Through the seethin' roar and screech he's patrollin' on the beach,--"
481,THE LIFE-SAVER,The Gov'ment's hired man fer savin' life.
482,THE LIFE-SAVER,
483,THE LIFE-SAVER,"He's strugglin' with the gusts that strike and bruise him like a hammer,"
484,THE LIFE-SAVER,"He's fightin' sand that stings like swarmin' bees,"
485,THE LIFE-SAVER,He's list'nin' through the whirlwind and the thunder and the clamor--
486,THE LIFE-SAVER,A-list'nin' fer the signal from the seas;
487,THE LIFE-SAVER,"He's breakin' ribs and muscles launchin' life-boats in the surges,"
488,THE LIFE-SAVER,"He's drippin' wet and chilled in every bone,"
489,THE LIFE-SAVER,"He's bringin' men from death back ter flesh and blood and breath,"
490,THE LIFE-SAVER,And he never stops ter think about his own;
491,THE LIFE-SAVER,
492,THE LIFE-SAVER,"He's a-pullin' at an oar that is freezin' to his fingers,"
493,THE LIFE-SAVER,"He's a-clingin' in the riggin' of a wreck,"
494,THE LIFE-SAVER,"He knows destruction's nearer every minute that he lingers,"
495,THE LIFE-SAVER,But it do'n't appear ter worry him a speck:
496,THE LIFE-SAVER,He's draggin' draggled corpses from the clutches of the combers--
497,THE LIFE-SAVER,The kind of job a common chap would shirk--
498,THE LIFE-SAVER,"But he takes 'em from the wave and he fits 'em fer the grave,"
499,THE LIFE-SAVER,And he thinks it's all included in his work.
500,THE LIFE-SAVER,
501,THE LIFE-SAVER,"He is rigger, rower, swimmer, sailor, doctor, undertaker,"
502,THE LIFE-SAVER,And he's good at every one of 'em the same:
503,THE LIFE-SAVER,"And he risks his life fer others in the quicksand and the breaker,"
504,THE LIFE-SAVER,And a thousand wives and mothers bless his name.
505,THE LIFE-SAVER,"He's an angel dressed in oilskins, he's a saint in a ""sou'wester"","
506,THE LIFE-SAVER,"He's as plucky as they make, or ever can;"
507,THE LIFE-SAVER,"He's a hero born and bred, but it hasn't swelled his head,"
508,THE LIFE-SAVER,And he's jest the U.S. Gov'ment's hired man.

591,THE BULLFROG SERENADE,"And the dew is on the clover,"

593,THE BULLFROG SERENADE,When the cow-bells melt and mingle
594,THE BULLFROG SERENADE,"In a softened, silver jingle,"
595,THE BULLFROG SERENADE,And the old hen calls the chickens in to bed;
596,THE BULLFROG SERENADE,When the marshy meadows glimmer
597,THE BULLFROG SERENADE,"With a misty, purple shimmer,"

599,THE BULLFROG SERENADE,When the firefly lamps are burning

610,THE BULLFROG SERENADE,Till the echoes soon are ringing
611,THE BULLFROG SERENADE,With the big green-coated leader's double-bass.

714,THE BEST SPARE ROOM,"And it touched the mantel's splendor, where the wax fruit used to be,"
