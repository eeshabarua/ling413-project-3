80,VAGABONDIA.,
81,VAGABONDIA.,
82,VAGABONDIA.,Off with the fetters
83,VAGABONDIA.,That chafe and restrain!
84,VAGABONDIA.,Off with the chain!
85,VAGABONDIA.,"Here Art and Letters,"
86,VAGABONDIA.,"Music and wine,"
87,VAGABONDIA.,"And Myrtle and Wanda,"
88,VAGABONDIA.,"The winsome witches,"
89,VAGABONDIA.,Blithely combine.
90,VAGABONDIA.,"Here are true riches,"
91,VAGABONDIA.,"Here is Golconda,"
92,VAGABONDIA.,"Here are the Indies,"
93,VAGABONDIA.,Here we are free--
94,VAGABONDIA.,"Free as the wind is,"
95,VAGABONDIA.,"Free, as the sea."
96,VAGABONDIA.,Free!
97,VAGABONDIA.,
98,VAGABONDIA.,Houp-la!
99,VAGABONDIA.,
100,VAGABONDIA.,What have we
101,VAGABONDIA.,To do with the way
102,VAGABONDIA.,Of the Pharisee?
103,VAGABONDIA.,We go or we stay
104,VAGABONDIA.,At our own sweet will;
105,VAGABONDIA.,"We think as we say,"
106,VAGABONDIA.,And we say or keep still
107,VAGABONDIA.,"At our own sweet will,"
108,VAGABONDIA.,At our own sweet will.
109,VAGABONDIA.,
110,VAGABONDIA.,Here we are free
111,VAGABONDIA.,"To be good or bad,"
112,VAGABONDIA.,"Sane or mad,"
113,VAGABONDIA.,Merry or grim
114,VAGABONDIA.,"As the mood may be,--"
115,VAGABONDIA.,Free as the whim
116,VAGABONDIA.,"Of a spook on a spree,--"
117,VAGABONDIA.,"Free to be oddities,"
118,VAGABONDIA.,"Not mere commodities,"
119,VAGABONDIA.,"Stupid and salable,"
120,VAGABONDIA.,"Wholly available,"
121,VAGABONDIA.,Ranged upon shelves;
122,VAGABONDIA.,Each with his puny form
123,VAGABONDIA.,"In the same uniform,"
124,VAGABONDIA.,Cramped and disabled;
125,VAGABONDIA.,"We are not labelled,"
126,VAGABONDIA.,We are ourselves.
127,VAGABONDIA.,
128,VAGABONDIA.,"Here is the real,"
129,VAGABONDIA.,Here the ideal;
130,VAGABONDIA.,Laughable hardship
131,VAGABONDIA.,"Met and forgot,"
132,VAGABONDIA.,Glory of bardship--
133,VAGABONDIA.,World's bloom and world's blot;
134,VAGABONDIA.,"The shock and the jostle,"
135,VAGABONDIA.,"The mock and the push,"
136,VAGABONDIA.,But hearts like the throstle
137,VAGABONDIA.,A-joy in the bush;
138,VAGABONDIA.,Wits that would merrily
139,VAGABONDIA.,"Laugh away wrong,"
140,VAGABONDIA.,Throats that would verily
141,VAGABONDIA.,Melt Hell in Song.
142,VAGABONDIA.,
143,VAGABONDIA.,What though the dimes be
144,VAGABONDIA.,"Elusive as rhymes be,"
145,VAGABONDIA.,"And Bessie, with finger"
146,VAGABONDIA.,"Uplifted, is warning"
147,VAGABONDIA.,That breakfast next morning
148,VAGABONDIA.,(A subject she's scorning)
149,VAGABONDIA.,Is mighty uncertain!
150,VAGABONDIA.,
151,VAGABONDIA.,What care we? Linger
152,VAGABONDIA.,A moment to kiss--
153,VAGABONDIA.,No time's amiss
154,VAGABONDIA.,To a vagabond's ardor--
155,VAGABONDIA.,Thee finish the larder
156,VAGABONDIA.,And pull down the curtain.
157,VAGABONDIA.,
158,VAGABONDIA.,"Unless ere the kiss come,"
159,VAGABONDIA.,"Black Richard or Bliss come,"
160,VAGABONDIA.,"Or Tom with a flagon,"
161,VAGABONDIA.,Or Karl with a jag on--
162,VAGABONDIA.,Then up and after
163,VAGABONDIA.,The joy of the night
164,VAGABONDIA.,With the hounds of laughter
165,VAGABONDIA.,To follow the flight
166,VAGABONDIA.,Of the fox-foot hours
167,VAGABONDIA.,That double and run
168,VAGABONDIA.,Through brakes and bowers
169,VAGABONDIA.,Of folly and fun.
170,VAGABONDIA.,
171,VAGABONDIA.,With the comrade heart
172,VAGABONDIA.,"For a moment's play,"
173,VAGABONDIA.,And the comrade heart
174,VAGABONDIA.,"For a heavier day,"
175,VAGABONDIA.,And the comrade heart
176,VAGABONDIA.,Forever and aye.
177,VAGABONDIA.,
178,VAGABONDIA.,For the joy of wine
179,VAGABONDIA.,Is not for long;
180,VAGABONDIA.,And the joy of song
181,VAGABONDIA.,Is a dream of shine;
182,VAGABONDIA.,But the comrade heart
183,VAGABONDIA.,Shall outlast art
184,VAGABONDIA.,And a woman's love
185,VAGABONDIA.,The fame thereof.
186,VAGABONDIA.,
187,VAGABONDIA.,But wine for a sign
188,VAGABONDIA.,Of the love we bring!
189,VAGABONDIA.,And song for an oath
190,VAGABONDIA.,That Love is king!
191,VAGABONDIA.,"And both, and both"
192,VAGABONDIA.,For his worshipping!
193,VAGABONDIA.,
194,VAGABONDIA.,Then up and away
195,VAGABONDIA.,"Till the break of day,"
196,VAGABONDIA.,"With a heart that's merry,"
197,VAGABONDIA.,"And a Tom-and-Jerry,"
198,VAGABONDIA.,And a derry-down-derry--
199,VAGABONDIA.,What's that you say.
200,VAGABONDIA.,You highly respectable
201,VAGABONDIA.,Buyers and sellers?
202,VAGABONDIA.,We should be decenter?
203,VAGABONDIA.,Not as we please inter
204,VAGABONDIA.,"Custom, frugality,"
205,VAGABONDIA.,Use and morality
206,VAGABONDIA.,In the delectable
207,VAGABONDIA.,Depths of wine-cellars?
208,VAGABONDIA.,
209,VAGABONDIA.,"Midnights of revel,"
210,VAGABONDIA.,And noondays of song!
211,VAGABONDIA.,Is it so wrong?
212,VAGABONDIA.,Go to the Devil!
213,VAGABONDIA.,
214,VAGABONDIA.,"I tell you that we,"
215,VAGABONDIA.,While you are smirking
216,VAGABONDIA.,And lying and shirking
217,VAGABONDIA.,"life's duty of duties,"
218,VAGABONDIA.,"Honest sincerity,"
219,VAGABONDIA.,We are in verity
220,VAGABONDIA.,Free!
221,VAGABONDIA.,Free to rejoice
222,VAGABONDIA.,In blisses and beauties!
223,VAGABONDIA.,Free as the voice
224,VAGABONDIA.,Of the wind as it passes!
225,VAGABONDIA.,Free as the bird
226,VAGABONDIA.,In the weft of the grasses!
227,VAGABONDIA.,Free as the word
228,VAGABONDIA.,Of the sun to the sea--
229,VAGABONDIA.,Free!
230,VAGABONDIA.,
231,VAGABONDIA.,

234,A WAIF.,A WAIF.
235,A WAIF.,
236,A WAIF.,
237,A WAIF.,Do you know what it is to be vagrant born?
238,A WAIF.,"A waif is only a waif. And so,"
239,A WAIF.,"For another idle hour I sit,"
240,A WAIF.,In large content while the fire burns low.
241,A WAIF.,
242,A WAIF.,I gossip here to my crony heart
243,A WAIF.,"Of the day just over, and count it one"
244,A WAIF.,"Of the royal elemental days,"
245,A WAIF.,Though its dreams were few and its deeds were none.
246,A WAIF.,
247,A WAIF.,"Outside, the winter; inside, the warmth"
248,A WAIF.,And a sweet oblivion of turmoil. Why?
249,A WAIF.,All for a gentle girlish hand
250,A WAIF.,With its warm and lingering good-bye.

369,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,The fervid breath of our flushed Southern May
370,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,"Is sweet upon the city's throat and lips,"
371,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,As a lover's whose tired arm slips
372,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,Listlessly over the shoulder of a queen.
373,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,
374,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,Far away
375,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,The river melts in the unseen.
376,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,"Oh, beautiful Girl-City, how she dips"
377,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,Her feet in the stream
378,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,With a touch that is half a kiss and half a dream!

385,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,Left at some shrine his offering.
386,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,
387,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,Soft winds kiss
388,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,My cheek with a slow lingering.
389,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,A luring whisper where the laurels stir
390,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,Wiles my heart back to woodland-ward again.
391,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,
392,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,"But lo,"
393,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,"Across the sky the sunset couriers run,"

398,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,
399,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,O Eldorado of the templed clouds!
400,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,O golden city of the western sky!
401,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,Not like the Spaniard would I storm thy gates;
402,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,Not like the babe stretch chubby hands and cry
403,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,
404,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,"To have thee for a toy; but far from crowds,"
405,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,"Like my Faun brother in the ferny glen,"
406,EVENING ON THE POTOMAC.,"Peer from the wood's edge while thy glory waits,"
