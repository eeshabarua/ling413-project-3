_Canon Residentiary and Precentor of Truro
December_ 1903

          Many had builded, and, the building done,
            Through our adorn√®d gates with din
          Came Prince and Priest, with pipe and clarion
            Leading the right God in.

          Yet, had the perfect temple quickened then
            And whispered us between our song,
          _"Give God the praise. To whom of living men
            Shall next our thanks belong?"_

          Then had the few, the very few, that wist
            His Atlantean labour, swerved
          Their eyes to seek, and in the triumph missed,
            The man that most deserved.

He only of us was incorporate
            In all that fabric; stone by stone
          Had built his life in her, had made his fate
            And her perfection one;

          Given all he had; and now--when all was given--
            Far spent, within a private shade,
          Heard the loud organ pealing praise to Heaven,
            And learned why man is made.--

         To break his strength, yet always to be brave;
           To preach, and act, the Crucified ...
         Sweep by, O Prince and Prelate, up the nave,
           And fill it with your pride!

         Better than ye what made th' old temples great,
           Because he loved, he understood;
         Indignant that his darling, less in state,
           Should lack a martyr's blood.

She hath it now. O mason, strip away
            Her scaffolding, the flower disclose!
          Lay by the tools with his o'er-wearied clay--
          But She shall bloom unto its Judgment Day,
            His ever-living Rose!
