47,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.
48,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,
49,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,
50,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,"I love it, I love it; and who shall dare"
51,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,To chide me for loving that old arm-chair?
52,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,I've cherished it long as a sainted prize;
53,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,I've bedewed it with tears and embalmed it with sighs
54,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,'Tis bound by a thousand bands to my heart;
55,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,"Not a tie will break, not a link will start."
56,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,Would ye learn the spell?--a mother sat there:
57,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,And a sacred thing is that old arm-chair.
58,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,
59,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,In childhood's hour I lingered near
60,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,The hallowed seat with listening ear;
61,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,"And gentle words that mother would give,"
62,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,To fit me to die and teach me to live.
63,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,"She told me that shame would never betide,"
64,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,With truth for my creed and God for my guide
65,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,"She taught me to lisp my earliest prayer,"
66,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,As I knelt beside that old arm-chair.
67,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,
68,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,"I sat and watched her many a day,"
69,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,When her eye grew dim and her locks were gray;
70,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,"And I almost worshipped her when she smiled,"
71,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,And turned from her Bible to bless her child.
72,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,"Years rolled on, but the last one sped--"
73,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,"My idol was shattered, my earth-star fled;"
74,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,"I learned how much the heart could bear,"
75,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,When I saw her die in that old arm-chair.
76,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,
77,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,"'Tis past, 'tis past, but I gaze on it now"
78,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,With quivering breath and throbbing brow:
79,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,"'Twas there she nursed me, 'twas there she died;"
80,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,And memory flows with lava tide.
81,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,"Say it is folly, and deem me weak"
82,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,While the scalding tears drop down my cheek:
83,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,"But I love it, I love it, and cannot tear"
84,THE OLD ARM-CHAIR.,My soul from a mother's old arm-chair.
