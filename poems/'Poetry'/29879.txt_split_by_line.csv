94,HAYLEY.,
95,HAYLEY.,No one can have reflected on the history of genius without being
96,HAYLEY.,impressed with a melancholy feeling at the obscurity in which the lives
97,HAYLEY.,"of the poets of our country are, with few exceptions, involved. That"
98,HAYLEY.,"they lived, and wrote, and died, comprises nearly all that is known of"
99,HAYLEY.,"many, and, of others, the few facts which are preserved are often"
100,HAYLEY.,"records of privations, or sufferings, or errors. The cause of the"
101,HAYLEY.,"lamentable deficiency of materials for literary biography may, without"
102,HAYLEY.,"difficulty, be explained. The lives of authors are seldom marked by"
103,HAYLEY.,events of an unusual character; and they rarely leave behind them the
104,HAYLEY.,"most interesting work a writer could compose, and which would embrace"
105,HAYLEY.,"nearly all the important facts in his career, a ""History of his Books,"""
106,HAYLEY.,"containing the motives which produced them, the various incidents"
107,HAYLEY.,"respecting their progress, and a faithful account of the bitter"
108,HAYLEY.,"disappointment, whether the object was fame or profit, or both, which,"
109,HAYLEY.,"in most instances, is the result of his labours. Various motives deter"
110,HAYLEY.,"men from writing such a volume; for, though quacks and charlatans"
111,HAYLEY.,"readily become auto-biographers, and fill their prefaces with their"
112,HAYLEY.,"personal concerns, real merit shrinks from such disgusting egotism, and,"
113,HAYLEY.,"flying to the opposite extreme, leaves no authentic notice of their"
114,HAYLEY.,"struggles, its hopes, or its disappointments. Nor is the history of"
115,HAYLEY.,writers to be expected from their contemporaries; because few will
116,HAYLEY.,"venture to anticipate the judgment of posterity, and mankind are usually"
117,HAYLEY.,"so isolated in self, and so jealous of others, that neither time nor"
118,HAYLEY.,inclination admits of their becoming the Boswells of all those whose
119,HAYLEY.,productions excite admiration.
120,HAYLEY.,
121,HAYLEY.,"If these remarks be true, surprise cannot be felt, though there is"
122,HAYLEY.,"abundance of cause for regret, that little is known of a poet whose"
123,HAYLEY.,merits were not appreciated until after his decease: whose powers were
124,HAYLEY.,destroyed by a distressing malady at a period of life when literary
125,HAYLEY.,exertions begin to be rewarded and stimulated by popular applause.
126,HAYLEY.,
127,HAYLEY.,"For the facts contained in the following Memoir of Collins, the author"
128,HAYLEY.,"is indebted to the researches of others, as his own, which were very"
129,HAYLEY.,"extensive, were rewarded by trifling discoveries. Dr. Johnson's Life is"
130,HAYLEY.,well known; but the praise of collecting every particular which industry
131,HAYLEY.,"and zeal could glean belongs to the Rev. Alexander Dyce, the result of"
132,HAYLEY.,"whose inquiries may be found in his notes to Johnson's Memoir, prefixed"
133,HAYLEY.,to an edition of Collins's works which he lately edited. Those notices
134,HAYLEY.,"are now, for the first time, wove into a Memoir of Collins; and in"
135,HAYLEY.,leaving it to another to erect a fabric out of the materials which he
136,HAYLEY.,"has collected instead of being himself the architect, Mr. Dyce has"
137,HAYLEY.,evinced a degree of modesty which those who know him must greatly
138,HAYLEY.,lament.

141,HAYLEY.,
142,HAYLEY.,"WILLIAM COLLINS was born at Chichester, on the 25th of December, 1721,"
143,HAYLEY.,"and was baptized in the parish church of St. Peter the Great, alias"
144,HAYLEY.,"Subdeanery in that city, on the first of the following January. He was"
145,HAYLEY.,"the son of William Collins, who was then the Mayor of Chichester, where"
146,HAYLEY.,"he exercised the trade of a hatter, and lived in a respectable manner."
147,HAYLEY.,"His mother was Elizabeth, the sister of a Colonel Martyn, to whose"
148,HAYLEY.,bounty the poet was deeply indebted.
149,HAYLEY.,
150,HAYLEY.,"Being destined for the church, young Collins was admitted a scholar of"
151,HAYLEY.,"Winchester College on the 19th of January, 1733, where he was educated"
152,HAYLEY.,by Dr. Burton; and in 1740 he stood first on the list of scholars who
153,HAYLEY.,"were to be received at New College. No vacancy, however, occurred, and"
154,HAYLEY.,the circumstance is said by Johnson to have been the original misfortune
155,HAYLEY.,"of his life. He became a commoner of Queen's,[1] whence, on the 29th of"
156,HAYLEY.,"July, 1741, he was elected a demy of Magdalen College. During his stay"
157,HAYLEY.,"at Queen's he was distinguished for genius and indolence, and the few"
158,HAYLEY.,exercises which he could be induced to write bear evident marks of both
159,HAYLEY.,"qualities. He continued at Oxford until he took his bachelor's degree,"
160,HAYLEY.,"and then suddenly left the University, his motive, as he alleged, being"
161,HAYLEY.,"that he missed a fellowship, for which he offered himself; but it has"
162,HAYLEY.,"been assigned to his disgust at the dulness of a college life, and to"
163,HAYLEY.,his being involved in debt.
164,HAYLEY.,
165,HAYLEY.,"On arriving in London, which was either in 1743 or 1744, he became, says"
166,HAYLEY.,"Johnson, ""a literary adventurer, with many projects in his head and very"
167,HAYLEY.,"little money in his pocket."" Collins was not without some reputation as"
168,HAYLEY.,an author when he proposed to adopt the most uncertain and deplorable of
169,HAYLEY.,"all professions, that of literature, for a subsistence. Whilst at"
170,HAYLEY.,"Winchester school he wrote his Eclogues, and had appeared before the"
171,HAYLEY.,public in some verses addressed to a lady weeping at her sister's
172,HAYLEY.,"marriage, which were printed in the Gentleman's Magazine, Oct. 1739,"
173,HAYLEY.,"when Collins was in his eighteenth year. In January, 1742, he published"
174,HAYLEY.,"his Eclogues, under the title of ""Persian Eclogues;""[2] and, in"
175,HAYLEY.,"December, 1743, his ""Verses to Sir Thomas Hanmer on his Edition of"
176,HAYLEY.,"Shakespeare,"" appeared. To neither did he affix his name, but the latter"
177,HAYLEY.,"was said to be by ""a Gentleman of Oxford."""
178,HAYLEY.,
179,HAYLEY.,"From the time he settled in London, his mind was more occupied with"
180,HAYLEY.,"literary projects than with steady application; nor had poesy, for which"
181,HAYLEY.,"Nature peculiarly designed him, sufficient attractions to chain his"
182,HAYLEY.,wavering disposition. It is not certain whether his irresolution arose
183,HAYLEY.,"from the annoyance of importunate debtors, or from an original infirmity"
184,HAYLEY.,"of mind, or from these causes united. A popular writer[3] has defended"
185,HAYLEY.,"Collins from the charge of irresolution, on the ground that it was but"
186,HAYLEY.,"""the vacillations of a mind broken and confounded;"" and he urges, that"
187,HAYLEY.,"""he had exercised too constantly the highest faculties of fiction, and"
188,HAYLEY.,"precipitated himself into the dreariness of real life."" But this"
189,HAYLEY.,explanation does not account for the want of steadiness which prevented
190,HAYLEY.,Collins from accomplishing the objects he meditated. His mind was
191,HAYLEY.,"neither ""broken nor confounded,"" nor had he experienced the bitter pangs"
192,HAYLEY.,"of neglect, when with the buoyancy of hope, and a full confidence in his"
193,HAYLEY.,"extraordinary powers, he threw himself on the town, at the age of"
194,HAYLEY.,"twenty-three, intending to live by the exercise of his talents; but his"
195,HAYLEY.,"indecision was then as apparent as at any subsequent period, so that, in"
196,HAYLEY.,"truth, the effect preceded the cause to which it has been assigned."
197,HAYLEY.,
198,HAYLEY.,Mankind are becoming too much accustomed to witness splendid talents and
199,HAYLEY.,great firmness of mind united in the same person to partake the mistaken
200,HAYLEY.,sympathy which so many writers evince for the follies or vices of
201,HAYLEY.,"genius; nor will it much longer tolerate the opinion, that the"
202,HAYLEY.,"possession of the finest imagination, or the highest poetic capacity,"
203,HAYLEY.,"must necessarily be accompanied by eccentricity. It may, indeed, be"
204,HAYLEY.,"difficult to convert a poetical temperament into a merchant, or to make"
205,HAYLEY.,the man who is destined to delight or astonish mankind by his
206,HAYLEY.,"conceptions, sit quietly over a ledger; but the transition from poetry"
207,HAYLEY.,to the composition of such works as Collins planned is by no means
208,HAYLEY.,"unnatural, and the abandonment of his views respecting them must, in"
209,HAYLEY.,"justice to his memory, be attributed to a different cause."
210,HAYLEY.,
211,HAYLEY.,"The most probable reason is, that these works were mere speculations to"
212,HAYLEY.,"raise money, and that the idea was not encouraged by the booksellers;"
213,HAYLEY.,"but if, as Johnson, who knew Collins well, asserts, his character wanted"
214,HAYLEY.,"decision and perseverance, these defects may have been constitutional,"
215,HAYLEY.,"and were, perhaps, the germs of the disease which too soon ripened into"
216,HAYLEY.,the most frightful of human calamities. Endued with a morbid
217,HAYLEY.,"sensibility, which was as ill calculated to court popularity as to bear"
218,HAYLEY.,neglect; and wanting that stoical indifference to the opinions of the
219,HAYLEY.,"many, which ought to render those who are conscious of the value of"
220,HAYLEY.,their productions satisfied with the approbation of the few; Collins was
221,HAYLEY.,"too impatient of applause, and too anxious to attain perfection, to be a"
222,HAYLEY.,voluminous writer. To plan much rather than to execute any thing; to
223,HAYLEY.,"commence to-day an ode, to-morrow a tragedy, and to turn on the"
224,HAYLEY.,"following morning to a different subject, was the chief occupation of"
225,HAYLEY.,"his life for several years, during which time he destroyed the principal"
226,HAYLEY.,"part of the little that he wrote. To a man nearly pennyless, such a life"
227,HAYLEY.,must be attended by privations and danger; and he was in the hands of
228,HAYLEY.,"bailiffs, possibly not for the first time, very shortly before he became"
229,HAYLEY.,"independent by the death of his maternal uncle, Colonel Martyn. The"
230,HAYLEY.,"result proved that his want of firmness and perseverance was natural,"
231,HAYLEY.,and did not arise from the uncertainty or narrowness of his fortune; for
232,HAYLEY.,"being rescued from imprisonment, on the credit of a translation of"
233,HAYLEY.,"Aristotle's Poetics, which he engaged to furnish a publisher, a work, it"
234,HAYLEY.,"may be presumed, peculiarly suited to his genius, he no sooner found"
235,HAYLEY.,"himself in the possession of money by the death of his relative, than he"
236,HAYLEY.,"repaid the bookseller, and abandoned the translation for ever."
237,HAYLEY.,
238,HAYLEY.,"From the commencement of his career, Collins was, however, an object"
239,HAYLEY.,for sympathy instead of censure; and though few refuse their compassion
240,HAYLEY.,"to the confirmed lunatic, it is rare that the dreadful state of"
241,HAYLEY.,"irresolution and misery, which sometimes exist for years before the"
242,HAYLEY.,"fatal catastrophe, receives either pity or indulgence."
243,HAYLEY.,
244,HAYLEY.,"In 1747, Collins published his Odes, to the unrivaled splendour of a few"
245,HAYLEY.,of which he is alone indebted for his fame; but neither fame nor profit
246,HAYLEY.,was the immediate result; and the author of the Ode on the Passions had
247,HAYLEY.,"little reason to expect, from its reception by the public, that it was"
248,HAYLEY.,destined to live as long as the passions themselves animate or distract
249,HAYLEY.,the world.
250,HAYLEY.,
251,HAYLEY.,It is uncertain at what time he undertook to publish a volume of Odes in
252,HAYLEY.,"conjunction with Joseph Warton, but the intention is placed beyond"
253,HAYLEY.,dispute by the following letter from Warton to his brother. It is
254,HAYLEY.,"without a date, but it must have been written before the publication of"
255,HAYLEY.,"Collins's Odes in 1747, and before the appearance of Dodsley's"
256,HAYLEY.,"Museum,[4] as it is evident the Ode to a Lady on the Death of Colonel"
257,HAYLEY.,"Ross, which was inserted in that work, was not then in print."

264,"""DEAR TOM,","odes, and he likewise communicated some of his to me; and being"
265,"""DEAR TOM,","both in very high spirits, we took courage, resolved to join our"

267,"""DEAR TOM,","shall lose no honor by this publication, because I believe these"
268,"""DEAR TOM,","odes, as they now stand, are infinitely the best things I ever"
269,"""DEAR TOM,","wrote. You will see a very pretty one of Collins's, on the Death"

271,"""DEAR TOM,","Ross's intimate acquaintance, and who, by the way, is Miss Bett"

291,"""J. WARTON.""",
292,"""J. WARTON.""","The Poet's pecuniary difficulties were removed in 1749, by the death of"

295,"""J. WARTON.""",real and personal estate to be divided between his nephew William
296,"""J. WARTON.""","Collins, and his nieces Elizabeth and Anne Collins, and appointed the"
297,"""J. WARTON.""","said Elizabeth his executrix, who proved her uncle's will on the 30th of"
298,"""J. WARTON.""","May, 1749. Collins's share was, it is said, about two thousand pounds;"
299,"""J. WARTON.""","and, as has been already observed, the money came most opportunely: a"
300,"""J. WARTON.""","greater calamity even than poverty, however, shortly afterwards"

505,"""SIR,","bookseller, his tailor, and other tradesmen. But, I believe, a"
506,"""SIR,",desire to partake of the dissipation and gaiety of London was his
507,"""SIR,",principal motive. Colonel Martyn was at this time with his
508,"""SIR,","regiment; and Mr. Payne, a near relation, who had the management"

515,"""SIR,","on his cousin Payne, gaily dressed, and with a feather in his hat;"
516,"""SIR,","at which his relation expressed surprise, and told him his"
517,"""SIR,",appearance was by no means that of a young man who had not a
518,"""SIR,",single guinea he could call his own. This gave him great offence;
519,"""SIR,",but remembering his sole dependence for subsistence was in the
520,"""SIR,","power of Mr. Payne, he concealed his resentment; yet could not"

522,"""SIR,","thought him a d----d dull fellow;' though, indeed, this was an"
523,"""SIR,",epithet he was pleased to bestow on every one who did not think as
524,"""SIR,",he would have them. His frequent demands for a supply obliged Mr.
525,"""SIR,","Payne to tell him he must pursue some other line of life, for he"
526,"""SIR,",was sure Colonel Martyn would be displeased with him for having
527,"""SIR,","done so much. This resource being stopped, forced him to set about"
528,"""SIR,","some work, of which his 'History of the Revival of Learning' was"
529,"""SIR,",the first; and for which he printed proposals (one of which I
530,"""SIR,","have), and took the first subscription money from many of his"
531,"""SIR,","particular friends: the work was begun, but soon stood still. Both"
532,"""SIR,","Dr. Johnson and Mr. Langhorne are mistaken when they say, the"
533,"""SIR,","'Translation of Aristotle' was never begun: I know the contrary,"
534,"""SIR,","for some progress was made in both, but most in the latter. From"
535,"""SIR,","the freedom subsisting between us, we took the liberty of saying"
536,"""SIR,",any thing to each other. I one day reproached him with idleness;
537,"""SIR,","when, to convince me my censure was unjust, he showed me many"
538,"""SIR,","sheets of his 'Translation of Aristotle,' which he said he had so"
539,"""SIR,","fully employed himself about, as to prevent him calling on many of"
540,"""SIR,",his friends so frequently as he used to do. Soon after this he
541,"""SIR,","engaged with Mr. Manby, a bookseller on Ludgate Hill, to furnish"
542,"""SIR,","him with some Lives for the Biographia Britannica, which Manby was"
543,"""SIR,",then publishing. He showed me some of the lives in embryo; but I
544,"""SIR,",do not recollect that any of them came to perfection. To raise a
545,"""SIR,","present subsistence he set about writing his odes; and, having a"
546,"""SIR,","general invitation to my house, he frequently passed whole days"
547,"""SIR,","there, which he employed in writing them, and as frequently"
548,"""SIR,","burning what he had written, after reading them to me: many of"
549,"""SIR,","them, which pleased me, I struggled to preserve, but without"
550,"""SIR,","effect; for, pretending he would alter them, he got them from me,"
551,"""SIR,",and thrust them into the fire. He was an acceptable companion

555,"""SIR,",pieces before they were seen by the public. He was particularly
556,"""SIR,",noticed by the geniuses who frequented the Bedford and Slaughter's

558,"""SIR,","the scenes and green-room, where he made diverting observations on"
559,"""SIR,",the vanity and false consequence of that class of people; and his
560,"""SIR,",manner of relating them to his particular friends was extremely

566,"""SIR,",was in London that year; but I will not be so certain of the time
567,"""SIR,","he died, which I did not hear of till long after it happened. When"
568,"""SIR,","his health and faculties began to decline, he went to France, and"

761,"""T. W.""","drives the best disposed persons, adding, that he ""preserved the"
762,"""T. W.""","sources of action unpolluted, that his principles were never shaken,"

775,"""T. W.""",On this mainly depend the annoyances and dangers of him who seeks a

782,"""T. W.""","_popular_ taste of the present, as well as of former times, is"

792,"""T. W.""","abstracted from mundane feelings, too rich in imagery, and too strongly"
793,"""T. W.""","marked by the fervour of inspiration to be generally appreciated, his"
794,"""T. W.""","chance of being so, by the public generally, is at this moment less; and"
795,"""T. W.""",the only hope of his obtaining that popularity to which he is
796,"""T. W.""","unquestionably entitled, is by placing his works within the reach of"
797,"""T. W.""","all, and, more especially, by acquainting the multitude with the opinion"
798,"""T. W.""","entertained of him, by those whose judgments they have the sense to"
799,"""T. W.""","venerate, since they are sometimes willing to receive, on the credit of"
800,"""T. W.""","another, that which they have not themselves the discrimination or"

802,"""T. W.""",
803,"""T. W.""","An anecdote is related of Collins which, if true, proves that he felt"
804,"""T. W.""",the neglect with which his Odes were treated with the indignation

806,"""T. W.""","the first edition from the booksellers, he set fire to them with his own"

810,"""T. W.""",It is unnecessary to append to the Memoir of Collins many observations

813,"""T. W.""","force and eloquence by Sir Egerton Brydges, in the Essay prefixed to"
814,"""T. W.""",this edition. Campbell's remarks on the same subject cannot be
815,"""T. W.""",forgotten; and other critics of the highest reputation have concurred in
816,"""T. W.""",ascribing to Collins a conception and genius scarcely exceeded by any
817,"""T. W.""",English poet. To say that Sir Egerton Brydges's Essay exaggerates the
818,"""T. W.""",merit of some of his productions may produce the retort which has been
819,"""T. W.""","made to Johnson's criticism, that he was too deficient in feeling to be"

821,"""T. W.""","It is not, however, inconsistent with a high respect for Collins, to"
822,"""T. W.""","ascribe every possible praise to that unrivaled production, the Ode to"

1015,AN ESSAY ON THE GENIUS AND POEMS OF COLLINS.,
1016,"BY SIR EGERTON BRYDGES,","BY SIR EGERTON BRYDGES,"
1017,BART.,BART.
1018,BART.,
1019,BART.,
1020,BART.,"Collins is the founder of a new school of poetry, of a high class. It is"
1021,BART.,"true that, unless Buckhurst and Spenser had gone before him, he could"
1022,BART.,not have written as he has done; yet he is an inventor very distinct
1023,BART.,from both. He calls his odes descriptive and allegorical; and this
1024,BART.,"characterises them truly, but too generally. The personification of"
1025,BART.,abstract qualities had never been so happily executed before; the pure
1026,BART.,"spirituality of the conception, the elegance and force of the language,"
1027,BART.,"the harmony and variety of the numbers, were all executed with a"
1028,BART.,felicity which none before or since have reached. That these poems did
1029,BART.,not at once captivate the public attention cannot be accounted for by
1030,BART.,any cause hitherto assigned. We may not wonder that the multitude did
1031,BART.,"not at once perceive their full beauties; but that, among readers of"
1032,BART.,"taste and learning, there should not have been found a sufficient number"
1033,BART.,"to set the example of admiration, is very extraordinary. In addition to"
1034,BART.,"all their other high merits, the mere novelty of thought and manner were"
1035,BART.,sufficient to excite immediate notice. Nor was there any thing in
1036,BART.,Collins's station or character to create prejudices against the
1037,BART.,probability that beautiful effusions of genius might be struck out by
1038,BART.,"his hand. His education at the college of Winchester, his fame at"
1039,BART.,"Oxford, his associates in London, all were fair preludes to the"
1040,BART.,"production of beautiful poetry. Indeed, he had already produced"
1041,BART.,"beautiful poetry in his Oriental Eclogues, four years before his Odes"
1042,BART.,"appeared. These were, it is admitted, of a different cast from his Odes,"
1043,BART.,"and of a gentleness and chastity of thought and diction, which he"
1044,BART.,"himself was conscious, some years afterwards, did not very well"
1045,BART.,represent the gorgeousness of eastern composition.
1046,BART.,
1047,BART.,It was a crisis when there was a fair opening for new candidates for the
1048,BART.,laurel. The uniformity of Pope's style began already to pall upon the
1049,BART.,"public ear. Thomson was indolent, and Young eccentric; Gray had not yet"
1050,BART.,appeared on the stage; and Akenside's metaphysical subject and diffuse
1051,BART.,style were not calculated to engross the general taste. Johnson had
1052,BART.,"taken possession of the field of satire, but there are too many readers"
1053,BART.,of enthusiastic mind to be satisfied with satire. The pedantry and
1054,BART.,uncouthness of Walter Harte had precluded him from ever being a
1055,BART.,favourite with the public; Shenstone had not yet risen into fame; and
1056,BART.,"Lyttelton was engrossed by politics. When, therefore, Collins's Odes"
1057,BART.,"appeared, all speculation would have anticipated that they must have"
1058,BART.,been successful. But we must recollect that they did not excite the
1059,BART.,admiration of Johnson; and that Gray did not read them with that
1060,BART.,unqualified approval which his native taste would have inspired. This
1061,BART.,singularity must be accounted for by other causes than their want of
1062,BART.,merit.
1063,BART.,
1064,BART.,"The disappointment of Collins was so keen and deep, that he not only"
1065,BART.,"burned the unsold copies with his own hand, but soon fell into a"
1066,BART.,melancholy which ended in insanity. Many persons have affected to
1067,BART.,"comment on this result with an unfeeling ignorance of human nature, and,"
1068,BART.,"more especially, of fervid genius. It is, undoubtedly, highly dangerous"
1069,BART.,to give the entire reins to imagination; the discipline of a constant
1070,BART.,"exercise of reason is not only salutary, but necessary. But one can"
1071,BART.,easily conceive how the indulgence of that state of mind which produced
1072,BART.,"Collins's Odes could end in an entire overthrow of the intellect, when"
1073,BART.,embittered by a defect of the principal objects of his worldly ambition.
1074,BART.,He is said to have been puffed up by a vanity which prompted him to
1075,BART.,"expect that all eyes would be upon him, and all voices lifted in his"
1076,BART.,praise. Such was the conception of a vulgar observer of the human
1077,BART.,character. Why should it have been vanity that prompted this hope? It
1078,BART.,"was a consciousness of merit, of those brilliant powers which produced"
1079,BART.,the Ode to the Passions! was ever a voice content which sung to those
1080,BART.,"who would not hear, which was condemned"
1081,BART.,
1082,BART.,"""To waste its sweetness on the desert air?"""
1083,BART.,
1084,BART.,Spenser's power of personification is copious beyond example; but it is
1085,BART.,"seldom sufficiently select; rich as it is in imagination, it too"
1086,BART.,"commonly wants taste and delicacy; it has the fault of coarseness, which"
1087,BART.,"Burke's images in prose two centuries afterwards, sometimes fell into."
1088,BART.,"But Collins's images are as pure, and of as exquisite delicacy, as they"
1089,BART.,are spiritual. They are not human beings invested with some of the
1090,BART.,"attributes of angels, but the whole figure is purely angelic, and of a"
1091,BART.,higher order of creation; in this they are distinct even from the
1092,BART.,"admirable personifications of Gray, because they are less earthly. The"
1093,BART.,"Ode to the Passions is, by universal consent, the noblest of Collins's"
1094,BART.,"productions, because it exhibits a much more extended invention, not of"
1095,BART.,"one passion only, but of all the passions combined, acting, according to"
1096,BART.,"the powers of each, to one end. The execution, also, is the happiest,"
1097,BART.,each particular passion is drawn with inimitable force and compression.
1098,BART.,"Let us take only FEAR and DESPAIR, each dashed out in four lines, of"
1099,BART.,"which every word is like inspiration. Beautiful as Spenser is, and"
1100,BART.,"sometimes sublime, yet he redoubles his touches too much, and often"
1101,BART.,"introduces some coarse feature or expression, which destroys the spell."
1102,BART.,"Spenser, indeed, has other merits of splendid and inexhaustible"
1103,BART.,"invention, which render it impossible to put Collins on a par with him:"
1104,BART.,but we must not estimate merit by mere quantity: if a poet produces but
1105,BART.,"one short piece, which is perfect, he must be placed according to its"
1106,BART.,quality. And surely there is not a single figure in Collins's Ode to the
1107,BART.,"Passions which is not perfect, both in conception and language. He has"
1108,BART.,"had many imitators, but no one has ever approached him in his own"
1109,BART.,department.
1110,BART.,
1111,BART.,"The Ode to Evening is, perhaps, the next in point of merit. It is quite"
1112,BART.,of a different cast; it is descriptive of natural scenery; and such a
1113,BART.,"scene of enchanting repose was never exhibited by Claude, or any other"
1114,BART.,among the happiest of painters. Though a mere verbal description can
1115,BART.,never rival a fine picture in a mere address to the material part of our
1116,BART.,"nature, yet it far eclipses it with those who have the endowment of a"
1117,BART.,"brilliant fancy, because it gratifies their taste, selection, and"
1118,BART.,"sentiment. Delightful, therefore, as it is to look upon a Claude, it is"
1119,BART.,more delightful to look upon this description. It is vain to attempt to
1120,BART.,"analyse the charm of this Ode; it is so subtle, that it escapes"
1121,BART.,"analysis. Its harmony is so perfect, that it requires no rhyme: the"
1122,BART.,"objects are so happily chosen, and the simple epithets convey ideas and"
1123,BART.,"feelings so congenial to each other, as to throw the reader into the"
1124,BART.,very mood over which the personified being so beautifully designed
1125,BART.,presides. No other poem on the same subject has the same magic. It
1126,BART.,assuredly suggested some images and a tone of expression to Gray in his
1127,BART.,Elegy.
1128,BART.,
1129,BART.,The Ode on the Poetical Character is here and there a little involved
1130,BART.,"and obscure; but its general conception is magnificent, and beaming that"
1131,BART.,"spirit of inventive enthusiasm, which alone can cherish the poet's"
1132,BART.,"powers, and bring forth the due fruits. Collins never touched the lyre"
1133,BART.,but he was borne away by the inspiration under which he laboured. The
1134,BART.,"Dirge in Cymbeline, the lines on Thomson, and the Ode on Colonel Ross"
1135,BART.,"breathe such a beautiful simplicity of pathos, and yet are so highly"
1136,BART.,"poetical and graceful in every thought and tone, that, exquisitely"
1137,BART.,"polished as they are, and without one superfluous or one prosaic word,"
1138,BART.,they never once betray the artifices of composition. The extreme
1139,BART.,transparency of the words and thoughts would induce a vulgar reader to
1140,BART.,"consider them trite, while they are the expression of a genius so"
1141,BART.,"refined as to be all essence of spirit. In Gray, excellent as he is, we"
1142,BART.,"continually encounter the marks of labour and effort, and occasional"
1143,BART.,"crudeness, which shows that effort had not always succeeded, such as"
1144,BART.,"""iron hand and torturing hour;"" but nothing of this kind occurs in the"
1145,BART.,principal poems of Collins. There is a fire of mind which supersedes
1146,BART.,"labour, and produces what labour cannot. It has been said that Collins"
1147,BART.,is neither sublime nor pathetic; but only ingenious and fanciful. The
1148,BART.,"truth is, that he was cast in the very mould of sublimity and pathos. He"
1149,BART.,"lived in an atmosphere above the earth, and breathed only in a visionary"
1150,BART.,"world. He was conversant with nothing else, and this must have been the"
1151,BART.,secret by which he produced compositions so entirely spiritual. He who
1152,BART.,"has daily intercourse with the world, and feels the vulgar human"
1153,BART.,"passions, cannot be in a humour to write poems which do not partake of"
1154,BART.,earthly coarseness.
1155,BART.,
1156,BART.,"It may be asked, _cui bono?_ what is the moral use of such poems as"
1157,BART.,these? Whatever refines the intellect improves the heart; whatever
1158,BART.,augments and fortifies the spiritual part of our nature raises us in the
1159,BART.,rank of created beings. And what poems are more calculated to refine our
1160,BART.,"intellect, and increase our spirituality, than the poems of Collins? To"
1161,BART.,"embody, in a brilliant manner, the most beautiful abstractions, to put"
1162,BART.,"them into action, and to add to them splendour, harmony, strength, and"
1163,BART.,"purity of language, is to complete a task as admirable for its use and"
1164,BART.,"its delight, as it is difficult to be executed. No one can receive the"
1165,BART.,intellectual gratification which such works are capable of producing
1166,BART.,without being the better for it. The understanding was never yet roused
1167,BART.,to the conception of such pure and abstract thinking without an
1168,BART.,elevation of the whole nature of the being so roused. The expression of
1169,BART.,"subtle and evanescent ideas, carried to its perfection, is among the"
1170,BART.,very noblest and most exalted studies with which the human mind can be
1171,BART.,conversant.
1172,BART.,
1173,BART.,It has been the fashion of our own age to beat out works into twentyfold
1174,BART.,and fiftyfold the size of those of Collins. I do not quarrel with that
1175,BART.,fashion; each fashion has its use: and my own taste induces me to
1176,BART.,"perceive the value and many attractions of long narrative poems, full of"
1177,BART.,human passions and practical wisdom. The matter is more desirable than
1178,BART.,the workmanship; and much of occasional carelessness in the language may
1179,BART.,"be forgiven, for fertility of natural and just thought and interest of"
1180,BART.,"story. But this in no degree diminishes the value of those gems, which,"
1181,BART.,"though of the smallest size, comprehend perfections of every kind. It is"
1182,BART.,"easier to work upon a large field than a small one,--one where is"
1183,BART.,
1184,BART.,"""Ample room and verge enough"
1185,BART.,"The characters of hell to trace."""
1186,BART.,
1187,BART.,But these diffuse productions are not calculated to give the same sort
1188,BART.,of pleasure as the gems. How difficult was the path chosen by Collins
1189,BART.,is sufficiently proved by the want of success of all who have entered
1190,BART.,"the same walk: Gray's was not the same, as I shall endeavour presently"
1191,BART.,to show. In the miscellany of Dodsley and other collectors will be found
1192,BART.,numerous attempts at Allegorical Odes: they are almost all nauseous
1193,BART.,failures--without originality or distinctness of conception; bald in
1194,BART.,"their language, lame in their numbers, and repulsive from their"
1195,BART.,insipidity of ideas.
1196,BART.,
1197,BART.,"Gray's personifications can scarcely be called allegorical, they have so"
1198,BART.,much of humanity about them. He dealt in all the noble and melancholy
1199,BART.,feelings of the human heart: he never for one moment forgot to be a
1200,BART.,moralist: he was constantly under the influence of powerful sympathy for
1201,BART.,the miseries of man's life; and wrote from the overflow of his bosom
1202,BART.,rather than of his imagination. It is true that his imagination
1203,BART.,presented the pictures to him; but it was his heart which impelled him
1204,BART.,to speak. Take the Ode on the Prospect of Eton College; there is not one
1205,BART.,word which did not break from the bottom of his heart. The multitude
1206,BART.,cannot enter into the visionary world of Collins: all who have a spark
1207,BART.,of virtuous human feelings can sympathize with Gray. It is impossible to
1208,BART.,deny that of these two beautiful poets Gray is the most instructive as a
1209,BART.,"moralist; but Gray is not so original as Collins, not so inventive, not"
1210,BART.,"so perfect in his language, and has not so much the fire and flow of"
1211,BART.,inspiration.
1212,BART.,
1213,BART.,"When Collins is spoken of as one of the _minor_ poets, it is a sad"
1214,BART.,misapplication of the term. Unless he be minor because the number and
1215,BART.,"size of his poems is small, no one is less a minor poet. In him every"
1216,BART.,"word is poetry, and poetry either sublime or pathetic. He does not rise"
1217,BART.,"to the sublimity of Milton or Dante, or reach the graceful tenderness of"
1218,BART.,"Petrarch; but he has a visionary invention of his own, to which there is"
1219,BART.,"no rival. As long as the language lasts, every richly gifted and richly"
1220,BART.,cultivated mind will read him with intense and wondering rapture; and
1221,BART.,"will not cease to entertain the conviction, from his example, if from no"
1222,BART.,"other, that true poetry of the higher orders is real inspiration."
1223,BART.,
1224,BART.,"It will occur to many readers, on perusing these passages of exalted"
1225,BART.,"praise, that Johnson has spoken of Collins in a very different manner."
1226,BART.,Almost fifty years have elapsed since Johnson's final criticism on him
1227,BART.,"appeared in his Lives of the Poets. It disgusted me so much at the time,"
1228,BART.,"and the disgust continued so violent, that for a long period it blinded"
1229,BART.,"me to all his stupendous merits, because it evinced not only bad taste"
1230,BART.,"but unamiable feelings. I cannot yet either justify it, or account for"
1231,BART.,it. He speaks of Collins having sought for splendour without attaining
1232,BART.,"it--of clogging his lines with consonants, and of mistaking inversion of"
1233,BART.,language for poetry. Not one of these faults belongs to Collins. In
1234,BART.,"almost all his poems the words follow their natural order, and are"
1235,BART.,mellifluous beyond those of almost any other verse writer. If the
1236,BART.,"Passions are not described with splendour, there is no such thing as"
1237,BART.,splendour. If the beauties which he sought and attained are unnatural
1238,BART.,"and extravagant, then the tests of correctness and good taste which have"
1239,BART.,been hitherto set up must be abandoned.
1240,BART.,
1241,BART.,This severe criticism is the more extraordinary because Johnson
1242,BART.,professed a warm personal friendship for Collins; he professes
1243,BART.,"admiration of his talents, learning, and taste, as well as of his"
1244,BART.,"disposition and heart, and speaks of his afflicting ill health with a"
1245,BART.,"passionate tenderness which has seldom been equalled in beauty, pathos,"
1246,BART.,and force of language. That he could love him personally with such
1247,BART.,"fondness, but be blind to his splendid and unrivaled genius, is utterly"
1248,BART.,beyond my power to account for. Who can say that Johnson wanted taste
1249,BART.,"when we read his sublime and acute criticisms on Milton, Dryden, and"
1250,BART.,Pope? Was it that he roused all the faculties of his judgment when he
1251,BART.,"spoke of these great men of past times; yet, that when he descended to"
1252,BART.,"his contemporaries, he indulged his feelings rather than his intellect,"
1253,BART.,and suffered himself to be overcome by the evil passions of envy and
1254,BART.,"contempt? His natural taste was, probably, not the best; when his"
1255,BART.,criticisms were perfect he had tasked his intellect rather than his
1256,BART.,"feelings. He was a man of general wisdom and undoubted genius, but not a"
1257,BART.,"very nice scholar, and he prided himself upon his every-day sense, his"
1258,BART.,"practical knowledge, rather than those visionary musings which he"
1259,BART.,thought a dangerous indulgence of imagination. He could not put the
1260,BART.,"compositions of Collins among the mere curiosities of literature, but he"
1261,BART.,permitted himself to depreciate habits of mental excursion which he had
1262,BART.,not himself cultivated.
1263,BART.,
1264,BART.,It was not till more than twenty years after Collins's death that his
1265,BART.,Ode on the Superstitions of the Highlands was recovered. The two Wartons
1266,BART.,"had seen it, and spoke highly of it to Johnson and others. About 1781,"
1267,BART.,"or 1782, a copy was found among the papers of Dr. Carlysle, with a chasm"
1268,BART.,of two or three stanzas. The public deemed it equal to the expectations
1269,BART.,which had been raised of it; for my part I will confess that I was
1270,BART.,always deeply disappointed at it. There are in it occasional traces of
1271,BART.,Collins's genius and several good lines--but none grand--none of that
1272,BART.,felicitous flow and inspired vigour which mark the Ode to the Passions
1273,BART.,and other of his lyrics--none of that happy personification of abstract
1274,BART.,conceptions which is the characteristic of his genius. The majority of
1275,BART.,"the lines lag and move heavily, and do not seem to me to rise much"
1276,BART.,"above mediocrity in the expression. The subject was attractive, and"
1277,BART.,might have afforded space for the wild excursions of Collins's creative
1278,BART.,"powers. As to the edition of Bell, in which it is pretended that the"
1279,BART.,"lost stanzas have been recovered, I have no more doubt that they are"
1280,BART.,_spurious_ than that I did not write them myself: I will not dwell upon
1281,BART.,"this subject, but only mention that it is quite impossible Collins could"
1282,BART.,"write ""_Fate_ gave the _fatal_ blow,"" and ""bowing to Freedom's _yoke_;"""
1283,BART.,and such a line as
1284,BART.,
1285,BART.,"""In the first year of the first George's reign,"" &c."
1286,BART.,
1287,BART.,There is not one line among these interpolated stanzas which it is
1288,BART.,possible that Collins could have written.
1289,BART.,
1290,BART.,Mr. Ragdale relates that Collins was in the habit of writing numerous
1291,BART.,"fragments, and then throwing them into the flames. Jackson, of Exeter,"
1292,BART.,says the same of John Bampfylde. A sensitive mind is scarce ever
1293,BART.,"satisfied with the reception it meets, when, in first heat of"
1294,BART.,"composition, it hopes to delight some listener, to which it first"
1295,BART.,communicates its new effusions. It almost always considers itself to be
1296,BART.,"""damn'd by faint praise."" I have known fervid authors who, if they read"
1297,BART.,"or communicated a piece before it was finished, never went on with it."
1298,BART.,"They thought it became blown upon, and turned from it with coldness,"
1299,BART.,"disgust, and despair. Yet the hearer is commonly not in fault: who can"
1300,BART.,satisfy the warm hopes of aspiring and restless genius?
1301,BART.,
1302,BART.,The Wartons have expressed themselves with praise and affection of
1303,BART.,"Collins, but not, I think, with the entire admiration which was due to"
1304,BART.,"him. Joseph Warton was a good-natured and generous-minded man, but"
1305,BART.,something of rivalry lurked in his bosom; and the fraternal partiality
1306,BART.,of Thomas Warton had the same effect. The younger brother seems to have
1307,BART.,thought that Joseph's genius was equal to that of Collins. Gray had the
1308,BART.,critical acumen to discern the difference; but still he in no degree
1309,BART.,"does justice to Collins. He accuses him of want of taste and selection,"
1310,BART.,"which is a surprising charge; and the more so, because Gray did not"
1311,BART.,"disdain to borrow from him. Gray's fault was an affected fastidiousness,"
1312,BART.,as appears by the slighting manner in which he speaks of Thomson's
1313,BART.,"Castle of Indolence on its first appearance, as well as of Akenside's"
1314,BART.,"Pleasures of Imagination, and Shenstone's Elegies. That Gray had"
1315,BART.,"exquisite taste, and was a perfect scholar, no one can doubt."
1316,BART.,
1317,BART.,Collins lived thirteen years after the publication of his Odes. It does
1318,BART.,not appear that he produced any thing after this publication. How soon
1319,BART.,"his grand mental malady extinguished his literary powers, I do not"
1320,BART.,"exactly know, nor is it recorded, whether any part of it arose from"
1321,BART.,bodily disorders. Medical men have never agreed regarding this most
1322,BART.,deplorable of human afflictions. In Collins's case it probably arose
1323,BART.,from the mind. On such an intellectual temperament the extinction of the
1324,BART.,visions which Hope had painted to him seems to have been sufficient to
1325,BART.,"produce that derangement, which first enfeebled, and then perverted and"
1326,BART.,annihilated his faculties. The account given by Johnson is different
1327,BART.,from that supplied by Mr. Ragdale and another anonymous communication.
1328,BART.,
1329,BART.,"He had, perhaps, lucid intervals in which he discovered nothing but"
1330,BART.,weakness and exhaustion. But he appears to have sometimes had fits of
1331,BART.,violence and despair. It seems that he was an enthusiastic admirer of
1332,BART.,"Shakespeare, and a great reader of black letter books. It may be"
1333,BART.,inferred that his studies were not entirely given up during his malady;
1334,BART.,"but it is a subject of great wonder and regret that the Wartons, the"
1335,BART.,"intimate friends both of his better and darker days, have left no"
1336,BART.,"particular memorials of him. He had a sister, lately, if not still,"
1337,BART.,"living, from whom, though of a very uncongenial nature, something might"
1338,BART.,"surely have been gathered. But there is a familiarity which, by"
1339,BART.,"destroying admiration, destroys the perception of what will interest"
1340,BART.,"others. There are few of our poets of rare genius, of whose private life"
1341,BART.,"and character much is known. Little is known of Spenser, Shakespeare,"
1342,BART.,and Milton: not much even of Thomson. More is known of Gray by the
1343,BART.,"medium of his beautiful letters; but when Southey, Wordsworth, and Scott"
1344,BART.,"are gone, posterity will know every particular of them; and, even now,"
1345,BART.,know much which fills them with delight and admiration. But let us know
1346,BART.,"something in good time, also of the new candidates for poetical fame!"
1347,BART.,
1348,BART.,"If the life of a poet is not in accordance with his song, it may be"
1349,BART.,"suspected that the song itself is not genuine. Who can be a poet, and"
1350,BART.,yet be a worldling in his passions and habits? An artificial poet is a
1351,BART.,disgusting dealer in trifles: nothing but the predominance of strong and
1352,BART.,unstimulated feeling will give that inspiration without which it is
1353,BART.,"worse than an empty sound. When the passion is factitious, the"
1354,BART.,excitement has always an immoral tendency; but the delineation of real
1355,BART.,and amiable sentiments calls up a sympathy in other bosoms which thus
1356,BART.,confirms and fixes them where they would otherwise die away. The memory
1357,BART.,"may preserve what is artificial, but, when it becomes stale, it turns to"
1358,BART.,"offensiveness, and thus breeds an alienation from literature itself."
1359,BART.,
1360,BART.,That Collins has continued to increase in fame as years have passed
1361,BART.,"away, is the most decisive of all proofs that his poems have the pure"
1362,BART.,and sterling merit which began to be ascribed to them soon after his
1363,BART.,death. M. Bonstetten tells me that Gray died without a suspicion of the
1364,BART.,high rank he was thereafter to hold in the annals of British genius?
1365,BART.,What did poor Collins think when he submitted his sublime odes to the
1366,BART.,"flames? He must have had fits of confidence, even then, in himself; but"
1367,BART.,"intermixed with gloom and despair, and curses of the wretched doom of"
1368,BART.,his birth! Is it sufficient that a man should wrap himself up in
1369,BART.,"himself, and be content if the poetry creates itself and expires in his"
1370,BART.,"own heart? We strike the lyre to excite sympathy, and, if no one will"
1371,BART.,"hear, will any one not feel that he strikes in vain; and that the talent"
1372,BART.,"given us is useless, and even painful? But who can be assured that he"
1373,BART.,"has the talent if no one acknowledges it? To have it, and not to be"
1374,BART.,"assured that we have it, is a restless fire that burns to consume us."
1375,BART.,
1376,BART.,"Let no one envy the endowments, if he looks at the fate, of poets. Let"
1377,BART.,"him contemplate Spenser, Denham, Rochester, Otway, Collins, Chatterton,"
1378,BART.,"Burns, Kirke White, Bloomfield, Shelley, Keats, and Byron, besides those"
1379,BART.,of foreign countries! Perhaps Collins was the most unhappy of all; as he
1380,BART.,was assuredly one of the most inspired and most amiable.
1381,BART.,
1382,BART.,"""In woful measures wan Despair--"
1383,BART.,"Low sullen sounds his grief beguiled,"
1384,BART.,"A solemn, strange, and mingled air;"
1385,BART.,"'Twas sad by fits, by starts 'twas wild."""
1386,BART.,
1387,BART.,"Langhorne's edition of Collins first appeared in 1765, accompanied by"
1388,BART.,observations which have been generally appended to subsequent editions.
1389,BART.,These observations have commonly borne the character of feebleness and
1390,BART.,"affectation; they have a sort of pedantic prettiness, which is somewhat"
1391,BART.,"repulsive, but they do not want ingenuity, or justness of criticism."
1392,BART.,"Part of them, at least, had previously appeared in the Monthly Review,"
1393,BART.,probably written by Langhorne. Langhorne was not deficient himself in
1394,BART.,"poetical genius, but is principally remembered by a single beautiful"
1395,BART.,"stanza, ""Cold on Canadian hills,"" &c. From the time of Langhorne's first"
1396,BART.,"edition, Collins became a popular poet; a miniature edition appeared"
1397,BART.,"soon after that of Langhorne; and as long as I can remember books, which"
1398,BART.,"goes back at least to the year 1770, Collins's poems were almost"
1399,BART.,"universally on the lips of readers of English poetry. That Cowper, in"
1400,BART.,"1784, should speak of him as ""a poet of no great fame,"" proves nothing,"
1401,BART.,since Cowper's long seclusion from the world had made him utterly
1402,BART.,"ignorant of contemporary literature. The negative inference, from the"
1403,BART.,"omission of Beattie, is not of much weight. I cannot recollect the date"
1404,BART.,"of the article in the Monthly Review; but, as it appears that Collins"
1405,BART.,"survived till 1759, I suspect it was before Collins's death. It was in"
1406,BART.,"September, 1754, that the Wartons visited him at Chichester: in that"
1407,BART.,"year he paid a visit to Oxford, when it appears that he was suffering"
1408,BART.,"under exhausture, not alienation, of mind."
1409,BART.,
1410,BART.,"The critics, and, among the rest, Mrs. Barbauld and Campbell, have"
1411,BART.,"ascribed to him ""frequent obscurity;"" this is unjust,--his general"
1412,BART.,"characteristic is lucidness and transparency: he is never obscure,"
1413,BART.,"unless in the Ode to Liberty, and, perhaps, in a few passages of the Ode"
1414,BART.,"on the Manners. Campbell's criticism is, otherwise, worthy of this"
1415,BART.,"beautiful poet, whom he praises with congenial spirit. When Hazlitt"
1416,BART.,"speaks of the ""tinsel and splendid patchwork"" of Collins, ""mixed with"
1417,BART.,"the solid, sterling ore of his genius,"" he speaks of a base material not"
1418,BART.,"to be found there. In Collins there is no tinsel or patchwork, one of"
1419,BART.,"his excellencies is, that the whole of every piece is of one web; there"
1420,BART.,are no joinings or meaner threads. There is no height to which Collins
1421,BART.,"might not have risen, had he lived long, had his mind continued sound,"
1422,BART.,"and had he persevered in exercising his genius. Campbell remarks that,"
1423,BART.,"at the same age, Milton had written nothing which could eclipse his"
1424,BART.,productions.
1425,BART.,
1426,BART.,"Of the two communications regarding Collins, to which I have already"
1427,BART.,"alluded, one anonymous, the other by a Mr. John Ragsdale, I must say"
1428,BART.,"something more. The first, signed V., appeared in the Gentleman's"
1429,BART.,"Magazine, with the date of the 20th Jan. 1781. I well remember its"
1430,BART.,"publication, and with what eagerness I read it. I suspect it was at the"
1431,BART.,"very crisis of the appearance of the last portion of Johnson's Lives,"
1432,BART.,"but possibly a year earlier. I perused it with a mixture of delight,"
1433,BART.,"melancholy, and disgust; the first passage which struck me was this: ""As"
1434,BART.,"he brought with him [to Oxford], for so the whole tone of his"
1435,BART.,"conversation discovered, too high an opinion of his school acquisitions"
1436,BART.,"and a sovereign contempt for all academic studies and discipline, he"
1437,BART.,"never looked with any complacency on his situation in the University,"
1438,BART.,"but was always complaining of the dulness of a college life. In short,"
1439,BART.,"he threw up his demyship, and going to London, commenced a man of the"
1440,BART.,"town, spending his time in all the dissipation of Ranelagh, Vauxhall,"
1441,BART.,and the playhouses; and was romantic enough to suppose that his superior
1442,BART.,"abilities would draw the attention of the great world, by means of whom"
1443,BART.,"he was to make his fortune,"" &c., &c.--""Thus was lost to the world this"
1444,BART.,"unfortunate person, in the prime of life, without availing himself of"
1445,BART.,"fine abilities, which, if properly improved, must have raised him to the"
1446,BART.,"top of any profession, and have rendered him a blessing to his friends,"
1447,BART.,"and an ornament to his country."""
1448,BART.,
1449,BART.,The vulgarity and narrow-mindedness of this last paragraph filled me
1450,BART.,with indignation and contempt. In a selfish point of view Collins
1451,BART.,"might, unquestionably, have done better by binding himself to the"
1452,BART.,trammels of a profession; but would he have been more an honor to his
1453,BART.,friends and an ornament to his country? Are the fruits of genius he has
1454,BART.,"left behind no ornament or use to his country? Professional men, for the"
1455,BART.,"most part, live for themselves, and not for the world. Who now remembers"
1456,BART.,"Lord Camden, Lord Thurlow, Lord Rosslyn, Lord Kenyon, Lord Ellenborough,"
1457,BART.,"or a hundred episcopal or medical characters, all rich and famous in"
1458,BART.,their day?
1459,BART.,
1460,BART.,"The character of his person and habits we read with deep interest. ""He"
1461,BART.,"was passionately fond of music, good-natured, and affable, warm in his"
1462,BART.,"friendships, and visionary in his pursuits; and, as long as I knew him,"
1463,BART.,"very temperate in his eating and drinking. He was of a moderate stature,"
1464,BART.,"of a light and clear complexion, with gray eyes, so very weak at times"
1465,BART.,"as hardly to bear a candle in the room, and often raising within him"
1466,BART.,"apprehensions of blindness."""
1467,BART.,
1468,BART.,"The letter from Mr. John Ragsdale is addressed to Mr. William Hymers,"
1469,BART.,"Queen's College, Oxford, dated ""Hill Street, Richmond, in Surrey, July,"
1470,BART.,"1783."" He appears to have been a tradesman in Bond Street; and he"
1471,BART.,surveyed the character of Collins (with whom he was familiar) with a
1472,BART.,"tradesman's eye. He reproached the poet with idleness, not because he"
1473,BART.,"was lingering and losing his time on the road to fame, but because he"
1474,BART.,"omitted to get money by his pen. ""To raise a present subsistence,"" says"
1475,BART.,"Ragsdale, ""he set about writing his Odes; and having a general"
1476,BART.,"invitation to my house, he frequently passed whole days there, which he"
1477,BART.,"employed in writing them, and as frequently burning what he had written"
1478,BART.,"after he had read them to me: many of them, which pleased me, I"
1479,BART.,"struggled to preserve, but without effect; for, pretending he would"
1480,BART.,"alter them, he got them from me, and thrust them into the fire."" That he"
1481,BART.,wrote the Odes to gain a present subsistence is but the tradesman's
1482,BART.,mistaken comment.
1483,BART.,
1484,BART.,"Gray was about four years older than Collins, and he survived him twelve"
1485,BART.,years; he appears to have spent these years in gloominess and spleen;
1486,BART.,but we know not what intense pleasures he received from his solitary
1487,BART.,"studies, from the improvement of his mind, from that exquisite taste and"
1488,BART.,increasing erudition of which every day added to the stores. The
1489,BART.,"enthusiasm of Collins was more active and adventurous, and his erudition"
1490,BART.,probably more acute. Timidity and fastidiousness were great defects in
1491,BART.,"Gray; they kept down his invention, and made him resort to the wealth of"
1492,BART.,"others, when he could better have relied upon himself. But as to"
1493,BART.,"borrowing expressions and simple materials, no genius ever did"
1494,BART.,otherwise; it is the new and happy combination in which lies the
1495,BART.,"invention. It may be doubted which are now most popular, the Odes of"
1496,BART.,"Collins or of Gray. On the one hand, what is most abstract is least"
1497,BART.,"calculated for the general reader; on the other hand, the variety of"
1498,BART.,learned allusions in Gray renders the style and thoughts of his most
1499,BART.,"celebrated Odes less simple, less direct, and less easily comprehended"
1500,BART.,"at once; but then his deep morality, the touching strokes which go"
1501,BART.,"immediately to the heart, his sensibility to the common sorrows of human"
1502,BART.,"life, his powerful reflection of the sentiments which ""come home to"
1503,BART.,"every one's business and bosom,"" form an attraction which perhaps turns"
1504,BART.,the scale in his favour. Of both these sublime poets the correctness of
1505,BART.,composition renders the writings a national good.
1506,BART.,
1507,BART.,"The French Revolution, which affected and partly reversed the minds of"
1508,BART.,"all Europe, produced a new era in our literature. There was good as well"
1509,BART.,as evil in the new force thus infused into the human intellect. Our
1510,BART.,poetry had generally become tame and trite; a sort of languid mechanism
1511,BART.,"had brought it into contempt; it was very little read, and still less"
1512,BART.,"esteemed. This might be not merely the effect, but also the cause of a"
1513,BART.,deficiency of striking genius in the candidates for the laurel. Collins
1514,BART.,and Gray were dead; Mason had hung up the lyre; and Thomas Warton was
1515,BART.,then thought too laboured and quaint; Hayley had succeeded beyond
1516,BART.,expectation by a return to moral and didactic poetry at a moment when
1517,BART.,the public was satiated by vile imitations of lyrical and descriptive
1518,BART.,composition; but Cowper gave a new impulse to the curiosity of poetical
1519,BART.,"readers, by a natural train of thought and the unlaboured effusions of"
1520,BART.,genuine feeling. There is no doubt that a fearful regard to models
1521,BART.,stifles all force and preeminent merit. The burst of the French
1522,BART.,Revolution set the faculties of all young persons free. It was dangerous
1523,BART.,"to secondary talents, and only led them into extravagances and"
1524,BART.,"absurdities. To Wordsworth, Southey, Scott, it was the removal of a"
1525,BART.,"weight, which would have hid the fire of their genius. But the"
1526,BART.,exuberance of their inexhaustible minds in no degree lessens the value
1527,BART.,of the more reserved models of excellence of a tamer age. The contrast
1528,BART.,of their varied attractions supplies the reader with opposite kinds of
1529,BART.,"merit, which delight and improve the more by this very opposition."
1530,BART.,
1531,BART.,Authors seldom estimate each other rightly in their lifetimes. The race
1532,BART.,"of poets, of whom the last died with the century, had little friendship,"
1533,BART.,"or even acquaintance among themselves; or rather, they broke into little"
1534,BART.,"sets of two and three, which narrowed their opinions and their hearts;"
1535,BART.,"Gray and Mason, Johnson and the two Wartons, Cowper and Hayley, Darwin"
1536,BART.,"and Miss Seward; but Shenstone, Beattie, Akenside, Burns, Mrs. Carter,"
1537,BART.,"Mrs. Smith, &c. stood alone. This is not desirable. Innumerable"
1538,BART.,advantages spring from frank and generous communication. Collins and
1539,BART.,Gray had not the most remote personal knowledge of each other. Gray
1540,BART.,"never mentions Dr. Sneyd Davies, a poet and an Etonian, nearly"
1541,BART.,"contemporary; nor Nicholas Hardinge, a scholar and a poet also. Mundy,"
1542,BART.,"the author of Needwood Forest, passed a long life in the country,"
1543,BART.,"totally removed from poets and literati, except the small coterie of"
1544,BART.,"Miss Seward, at Litchfield. The lives of poets would be the most amusing"
1545,BART.,"of all biography, if the materials were less scanty: it is strange that"
1546,BART.,so few of them have left any ample records of themselves; of many not
1547,BART.,even a letter or fragment of memorials is preserved. None of Cowley's
1548,BART.,"letters, a mode of composition in which he is said to have eminently"
1549,BART.,"excelled, have come down to us. Of Prior, Tickell, Thomson, Young, Dyer,"
1550,BART.,"Akenside, the Wartons, there are few of any importance known to be in"
1551,BART.,"existence. Those of Hayley, which Dr. J. Johnson has brought forward,"
1552,BART.,are not of the interest which might have been expected. Mrs. Carter's
1553,BART.,"are excellent, and many of Beattie's amusing and amiable: it had been"
1554,BART.,well for Miss Seward if most of hers had been consigned to the flames.
1555,BART.,Those of Charlotte Smith it has not been thought prudent to give to the
1556,BART.,"public. The greater part of those of Lord Byron, which Moore has"
1557,BART.,"hitherto put forth, had better have been spared: they are written in"
1558,BART.,"false taste, and are under a factitious character: in general, the prose"
1559,BART.,style of poets is admirable;--it was not Lord Byron's excellence. We
1560,BART.,have no specimens of the prose of Collins: it is grievous that he did
1561,BART.,"not execute his project of The History of the Revival of Literature, or"
1562,BART.,"of the Lives for the Biographia Britannica, which he undertook. Poets of"
1563,BART.,"research are, of all authors, best qualified to write biography with"
1564,BART.,"sagacity and eloquence; they see into the human heart, and detect its"
1565,BART.,most secret movements; and if there be a class of literature more
1566,BART.,"amusing and more instructive than another, it is well written"
1567,BART.,biography.
1568,BART.,
1569,BART.,We have a few poets who have not possessed erudition; for genius will
1570,BART.,"overcome all deficiencies of art and labour, such as Shakespeare,"
1571,BART.,"Chatterton, Burns, and Bloomfield: but it cannot be questioned that"
1572,BART.,erudition is a mighty aid. Milton could never have been what he was
1573,BART.,without profound and laborious erudition. Another necessary knowledge is
1574,BART.,"the knowledge of the human heart, which no industry and learning will"
1575,BART.,"give. It is an intuitive gift, which mainly depends on an acute and"
1576,BART.,"correct imagination, and a sympathetic sensibility of the human"
1577,BART.,passions. Among the innumerable rich endowments of Shakespeare this was
1578,BART.,the first; it was the predominant brilliance of his knowledge which
1579,BART.,"gave him correctness of description, sentiment, and observation, and"
1580,BART.,"clearness, force, and eloquence of language."
1581,BART.,
1582,BART.,Collins had only reached the age of twenty-six when his Odes were
1583,BART.,published: what inconceivable power would the maturity of age have given
1584,BART.,him? It is lamentable that he had no familiar friend and companion from
1585,BART.,that period capable of apprehending and remembering his conversations.
1586,BART.,"In his lucid intervals he must have said many wise, many learned, and"
1587,BART.,"many brilliant things; perhaps his very disease, in its vacillation"
1588,BART.,"between light and darkness, may have struck out many unexpected and"
1589,BART.,"surprising beauties, which common attendants were utterly incapable of"
1590,BART.,appreciating. The flushes of the mind under the unnatural impulses of
1591,BART.,"malady are sometimes inimitably splendid. His reason, at times, was"
1592,BART.,"sound, for his reason was fervid to the last. But it is said that his"
1593,BART.,shrieks sometimes resounded through the cathedral cloisters of
1594,BART.,Chichester till the horror of those who heard him was insupportable.
1595,BART.,
1596,BART.,All these speculations may appear tedious to those whose curiosity is
1597,BART.,confined to facts: but new facts regarding Collins are not to be had:
1598,BART.,"and what are facts unless they are accompanied by reflections,"
1599,BART.,"conclusions, and sentiments? The use of facts is to teach us to think,"
1600,BART.,"to judge, and to feel: and facts, regarding men of genius, are valuable"
1601,BART.,in enabling us to contemplate how far the gifts of high intellect
1602,BART.,"contribute to our happiness, or afford guides for the rest of mankind;"
1603,BART.,in what respects they have the possessors upon an equality with the herd
1604,BART.,of the people; and where they expose them to temptations from which
1605,BART.,others are free. For these purposes the ill fated Collins is a
1606,BART.,"melancholy illustration: the Muse had touched the lips of his infancy,"
1607,BART.,and infused her spirit into him; she had given him a piercing
1608,BART.,"understanding, and an amiable disposition and temper; she enabled him to"
1609,BART.,"come forth with poetry of the first class, in the earliest bloom of"
1610,BART.,"youth; and to deserve, if not to win, the envied laurel, which millions"
1611,BART.,have reached at in vain! What seeming glories and blessings were these!
1612,BART.,Yet to how few was so much misery dispensed as to this once envied
1613,BART.,being! May we not hope that his spirit now has its mighty reward?
1614,BART.,
1615,BART.,Let it not be denied that there is high virtue in the culture of the
1616,BART.,"mind, when directed to pure and elevated objects, and accustoming itself"
1617,BART.,to travel in lofty paths! The mind cannot attain the necessary
1618,BART.,"refinement, nor have its sight cleared of the film of earthly grossness,"
1619,BART.,"unless the heart throws off the dregs of coarser feeling, and keeps its"
1620,BART.,"wings afloat on a lighter and airier atmosphere. It may be said, that"
1621,BART.,there have been bad men who have been great poets: but this position
1622,BART.,remains to be proved. The dissolute men who have written verses have not
1623,BART.,"been great poets. Were Dante, Petrarch, Tasso, Spenser, Shakespeare,"
1624,BART.,"Dryden, Pope, Thomson, Burns, bad men? We know that Milton's character"
1625,BART.,"was great and holy, whatever were his politics: and who could be more"
1626,BART.,"virtuous than Gray, Beattie, Cowper, and Kirke White? And have we not"
1627,BART.,"virtuous poets among the living,--men whose native splendour and"
1628,BART.,intellectual culture have almost purified them into spirits? Let us
1629,BART.,"never cease to meditate on the dejected inspiration, which could pour"
1630,BART.,forth such strains as these:
1631,BART.,
1632,BART.,"""With eyes upraised, as one inspired,"
1633,BART.,Pale Melancholy sat retired;
1634,BART.,"And from her wild sequester'd seat,"
1635,BART.,"In notes by distance made more sweet,"
1636,BART.,Pour'd through the mellow horn her pensive soul:
1637,BART.,"And, dashing soft from rocks around,"
1638,BART.,Bubbling runnels join'd the sound;
1639,BART.,"Through glades and glooms the mingled measures stole,"
1640,BART.,Or o'er some haunted stream with fond delay
1641,BART.,"Round a holy calm diffusing,"
1642,BART.,"Love of peace and lonely musing,"
1643,BART.,"In hollow murmurs died away."""
1644,BART.,
1645,BART.,There are those who will think the praises thus bestowed upon Collins
1646,BART.,extravagant. It is now sixty years since I became familiar with him;
1647,BART.,and I still think of him with unabated admiration. When the calm
1648,BART.,"judgment of age confirms the passion of youth and boyhood, we cannot be"
1649,BART.,much mistaken in the merit we ascribe to him who is the object of it.

1685,PREFACE.,"complexions or their dress; each nation hath a peculiarity in all these,"
1686,PREFACE.,to distinguish it from the rest of the world.
1687,PREFACE.,
1688,PREFACE.,"The gravity of the Spaniard, and the levity of the Frenchman, are as"
1689,PREFACE.,evident in all their productions as in their persons themselves; and the
1690,PREFACE.,"style of my countrymen is as naturally strong and nervous, as that of an"
1691,PREFACE.,Arabian or Persian is rich and figurative.
1692,PREFACE.,
1693,PREFACE.,There is an elegancy and wildness of thought which recommends all
1694,PREFACE.,their compositions; and our geniuses are as much too cold for the
1695,PREFACE.,"entertainment of such sentiments, as our climate is for their fruits"
1696,PREFACE.,and spices. If any of these beauties are to be found in the following
1697,PREFACE.,"Eclogues, I hope my reader will consider them as an argument of their"
1698,PREFACE.,"being original. I received them at the hands of a merchant, who had"
1699,PREFACE.,"made it his business to enrich himself with the learning, as well as the"
1700,PREFACE.,silks and carpets of the Persians. The little information I could
1701,PREFACE.,"gather concerning their author, was, that his name was Abdallah, and"
1702,PREFACE.,that he was a native of Tauris.
1703,PREFACE.,
1704,PREFACE.,"It was in that city that he died of a distemper fatal in those parts,"
1705,PREFACE.,whilst he was engaged in celebrating the victories of his favourite
1706,PREFACE.,"monarch, the great Abbas.[10] As to the Eclogues themselves, they give a"
1707,PREFACE.,"very just view of the miseries and inconveniences, as well as the"
1708,PREFACE.,"felicities, that attend one of the finest countries in the East."
1709,PREFACE.,
1710,PREFACE.,The time of writing them was probably in the beginning of Sha Sultan
1711,PREFACE.,"Hosseyn's reign, the successor of Sefi or Solyman the Second."
1712,PREFACE.,
1713,PREFACE.,"Whatever defects, as, I doubt not, there will be many, fall under the"
1714,PREFACE.,"reader's observation, I hope his candour will incline him to make the"
1715,PREFACE.,following reflection:
1716,PREFACE.,
1717,PREFACE.,"That the works of Orientals contain many peculiarities, and that,"
1718,PREFACE.,"through defect of language, few European translators can do them"
1719,PREFACE.,justice.

4390,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"The genius of the pastoral, as well as of every other respectable"
4391,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"species of poetry, had its origin in the east, and from thence was"
4392,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,transplanted by the muses of Greece; but whether from the continent of
4393,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"the Lesser Asia, or from Egypt, which, about the era of the Grecian"
4394,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"pastoral, was the hospitable nurse of letters, it is not easy to"
4395,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"determine. From the subjects, and the manner of Theocritus, one would"
4396,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"incline to the latter opinion, while the history of Bion is in favour of"
4397,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,the former.

4399,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"However, though it should still remain a doubt through what channel the"
4400,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"pastoral traveled westward, there is not the least shadow of uncertainty"
4401,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,concerning its oriental origin.
4402,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4403,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"In those ages which, guided by sacred chronology, from a comparative"
4404,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"view of time, we call the early ages, it appears, from the most"
4405,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"authentic historians, that the chiefs of the people employed themselves"
4406,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"in rural exercises, and that astronomers and legislators were at the"
4407,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"same time shepherds. Thus Strabo informs us, that the history of the"
4408,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,creation was communicated to the Egyptians by a Chaldean shepherd.
4409,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4410,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"From these circumstances it is evident, not only that such shepherds"
4411,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"were capable of all the dignity and elegance peculiar to poetry, but"
4412,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,that whatever poetry they attempted would be of the pastoral kind; would
4413,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,take its subjects from those scenes of rural simplicity in which they
4414,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"were conversant, and, as it was the offspring of harmony and nature,"
4415,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"would employ the powers it derived from the former, to celebrate the"
4416,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,beauty and benevolence of the latter.
4417,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4418,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"Accordingly we find that the most ancient poems treat of agriculture,"
4419,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"astronomy, and other objects within the rural and natural systems."
4420,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4421,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"What constitutes the difference between the georgic and the pastoral,"
4422,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,is love and the colloquial or dramatic form of composition peculiar to
4423,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"the latter; this form of composition is sometimes dispensed with, and"
4424,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,love and rural imagery alone are thought sufficient to distinguish
4425,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"the pastoral. The tender passion, however, seems to be essential to"
4426,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"this species of poetry, and is hardly ever excluded from those"
4427,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,pieces that were intended to come under this denomination: even in
4428,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"those eclogues of the Amoebean kind, whose only purport is a trial of"
4429,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"skill between contending shepherds, love has its usual share, and"
4430,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,the praises of their respective mistresses are the general subjects of
4431,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,the competitors.
4432,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4433,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"It is to be lamented, that scarce any oriental compositions of this kind"
4434,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"have survived the ravages of ignorance, tyranny, and time; we cannot"
4435,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"doubt that many such have been extant, possibly as far down as that"
4436,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"fatal period, never to be mentioned in the world of letters without"
4437,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"horror, when the glorious monuments of human ingenuity perished in the"
4438,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,ashes of the Alexandrian library.
4439,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4440,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"Those ingenious Greeks, whom we call the parents of pastoral poetry,"
4441,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"were, probably, no more than imitators, of imitators that derived their"
4442,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"harmony from higher and remoter sources, and kindled their poetical"
4443,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,fires at those then unextinguished lamps which burned within the tombs
4444,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,of oriental genius.
4445,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4446,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,It is evident that Homer has availed himself of those magnificent images
4447,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,and descriptions so frequently to be met with in the books of the Old
4448,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"Testament; and why may not Theocritus, Moschus, and Bion have found"
4449,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"their archetypes in other eastern writers, whose names have perished"
4450,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"with their works? yet, though it may not be illiberal to admit such a"
4451,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"supposition, it would certainly be invidious to conclude, what the"
4452,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"malignity of cavillers alone could suggest with regard to Homer, that"
4453,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"they destroyed the sources from which they borrowed, and, as it is"
4454,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"fabled of the young of the pelican, drained their supporters to death."
4455,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4456,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,As the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament was performed at the
4457,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"request, and under the patronage, of Ptolemy Philadelphus, it were not"
4458,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"to be wondered if Theocritus, who was entertained at that prince's"
4459,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"court, had borrowed some part of his pastoral imagery from the poetical"
4460,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,passages of those books. I think it can hardly be doubted that the
4461,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"Sicilian poet had in his eye certain expressions of the prophet Isaiah,"
4462,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,when he wrote the following lines:
4463,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4464,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"~Nyn ia men phoreoite batoi, phoreoite d' akanthai."
4465,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,Ha de kala Narkissos ep' arkeuthoisi komasai;

4471,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"All, all reversed--The pine with pears be crown'd,"
4472,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,And the bold deer shall drag the trembling hound.
4473,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4474,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"The cause, indeed, of these phenomena is very different in the Greek"
4475,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,from what it is in the Hebrew poet; the former employing them on the
4476,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"death, the latter on the birth, of an important person: but the marks of"
4477,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,imitation are nevertheless obvious.
4478,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4479,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"It might, however, be expected, that if Theocritus had borrowed at all"
4480,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"from the sacred writers, the celebrated pastoral epithalamium of"
4481,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"Solomon, so much within his own walk of poetry, would not certainly"
4482,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"have escaped his notice. His epithalamium on the marriage of Helena,"
4483,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"moreover, gave him an open field for imitation; therefore, if he has any"
4484,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"obligations to the royal bard, we may expect to find them there. The"
4485,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,very opening of the poem is in the spirit of the Hebrew song:
4486,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4487,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"~HoutÃ´ dÃª prÃ´iza katedrathes, Ã´ phile gambre;~"
4488,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4489,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,The colour of imitation is still stronger in the following passage:
4490,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4491,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"~AÃ´s antelloisa kalon diephaine prosÃ´pon,"
4492,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"Potnia nyx hate, leukon ear cheimÃ´nos anentos?"
4493,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"HÃ´de kai ha chrysea Helena diephainet' en amin,"
4494,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,Pieira megala hat' anedrame kosmos aroura.
4495,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"HÃª kapÃ´ kyparissos, Ãª harmati Thessalos hippos.~"
4496,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4497,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,This description of Helen is infinitely above the style and figure of
4498,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"the Sicilian pastoral: ""She is like the rising of the golden morning,"
4499,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"when the night departeth, and when the winter is over and gone. She"
4500,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"resembleth the cypress in the garden, the horse in the chariots of"
4501,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"Thessaly."" These figures plainly declare their origin; and others,"
4502,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"equally imitative, might be pointed out in the same idyllium."
4503,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4504,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,This beautiful and luxuriant marriage pastoral of Solomon is the only
4505,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,perfect form of the oriental eclogue that has survived the ruins of
4506,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"time; a happiness for which it is, probably, more indebted to its"
4507,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,sacred character than to its intrinsic merit. Not that it is by any
4508,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"means destitute of poetical excellence: like all the eastern poetry, it"
4509,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"is bold, wild, and unconnected in its figures, allusions, and parts, and"
4510,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,has all that graceful and magnificent daring which characterizes its
4511,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,metaphorical and comparative imagery.
4512,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4513,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"In consequence of these peculiarities, so ill adapted to the frigid"
4514,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"genius of the north, Mr. Collins could make but little use of it as a"
4515,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"precedent for his Oriental Eclogues; and even in his third eclogue,"
4516,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"where the subject is of a similar nature, he has chosen rather to follow"
4517,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,the mode of the Doric and the Latian pastoral.
4518,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,
4519,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,The scenery and subjects then of the foregoing eclogues alone are
4520,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"oriental; the style and colouring are purely European; and, for this"
4521,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"reason, the author's preface, in which he intimates that he had the"
4522,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"originals from a merchant who traded to the east, is omitted, as being"

4525,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIENTAL ECLOGUES.,"With regard to the merit of these eclogues, it may justly be asserted,"

4563,ECLOGUE I.,The two similes borrowed from rural objects are not only much in

4565,ECLOGUE I.,"notwithstanding, this defect in the former, that it wants a peculiar"
4566,ECLOGUE I.,propriety; for purity of thought may as well be applied to chastity as
4567,ECLOGUE I.,"to modesty; and from this instance, as well as from a thousand more, we"

4571,ECLOGUE I.,"It cannot be objected to this eclogue, that it wants both those"

4597,ECLOGUE II.,as it were by enchantment; and in this single couplet we feel all the
4598,ECLOGUE II.,effect that arises from the terrible wildness of a region unenlivened by
4599,ECLOGUE II.,the habitations of men. The verses that describe so minutely the
4600,ECLOGUE II.,camel-driver's little provisions have a touching influence on the
4601,ECLOGUE II.,"imagination, and prepare the reader to enter more feelingly into his"
4602,ECLOGUE II.,future apprehensions of distress:
4603,ECLOGUE II.,
4604,ECLOGUE II.,"""Bethink thee, Hassan, where shall thirst assuage,"
4605,ECLOGUE II.,"When fails this cruise, his unrelenting rage!"""
4606,ECLOGUE II.,
4607,ECLOGUE II.,"It is difficult to say whether his apostrophe to the ""mute companions of"
4608,ECLOGUE II.,"his toils"" is more to be admired for the elegance and beauty of the"
4609,ECLOGUE II.,"poetical imagery, or for the tenderness and humanity of the sentiment."
4610,ECLOGUE II.,"He who can read it without being affected, will do his heart no"
4611,ECLOGUE II.,injustice if he concludes it to be destitute of sensibility:
4612,ECLOGUE II.,
4613,ECLOGUE II.,"""Ye mute companions of my toils, that bear"
4614,ECLOGUE II.,In all my griefs a more than equal share!
4615,ECLOGUE II.,"Here, where no springs in murmurs break away,"
4616,ECLOGUE II.,"Or moss-crown'd fountains mitigate the day,"
4617,ECLOGUE II.,"In vain ye hope the green delights to know,"
4618,ECLOGUE II.,"Which plains more blest, or verdant vales, bestow:"
4619,ECLOGUE II.,"Here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found,"
4620,ECLOGUE II.,"And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around."""
4621,ECLOGUE II.,
4622,ECLOGUE II.,"Yet in these beautiful lines there is a slight error, which writers of"
4623,ECLOGUE II.,the greatest genius very frequently fall into.--It will be needless to
4624,ECLOGUE II.,"observe to the accurate reader, that in the fifth and sixth verses there"
4625,ECLOGUE II.,is a verbal pleonasm where the poet speaks of the _green_ delights of
4626,ECLOGUE II.,"_verdant_ vales. There is an oversight of the same kind in the Manners,"
4627,ECLOGUE II.,"an Ode, where the poet says,"
4628,ECLOGUE II.,
4629,ECLOGUE II.,"""----Seine's blue nymphs deplore"
4630,ECLOGUE II.,"In watchet weeds----."""
4631,ECLOGUE II.,
4632,ECLOGUE II.,"This fault is indeed a common one, but to a reader of taste it is"
4633,ECLOGUE II.,"nevertheless disgustful; and it is mentioned here, as the error of a man"
4634,ECLOGUE II.,"of genius and judgment, that men of genius and judgment may guard"
4635,ECLOGUE II.,against it.
4636,ECLOGUE II.,
4637,ECLOGUE II.,"Mr. Collins speaks like a true poet, as well in sentiment as expression,"
4638,ECLOGUE II.,"when, with regard to the thirst of wealth, he says,"
4639,ECLOGUE II.,
4640,ECLOGUE II.,"""Why heed we not, while mad we haste along,"
4641,ECLOGUE II.,"The gentle voice of Peace, or Pleasure's song?"
4642,ECLOGUE II.,"Or wherefore think the flowery mountain's side,"
4643,ECLOGUE II.,"The fountain's murmurs, and the valley's pride,"
4644,ECLOGUE II.,"Why think we these less pleasing to behold,"
4645,ECLOGUE II.,"Than dreary deserts, if they lead to gold?"""
4646,ECLOGUE II.,
4647,ECLOGUE II.,But however just these sentiments may appear to those who have not
4648,ECLOGUE II.,"revolted from nature and simplicity, had the author proclaimed them in"
4649,ECLOGUE II.,"Lombard Street, or Cheapside, he would not have been complimented with"
4650,ECLOGUE II.,"the understanding of the bellman.--A striking proof, that our own"
4651,ECLOGUE II.,particular ideas of happiness regulate our opinions concerning the sense
4652,ECLOGUE II.,and wisdom of others!
4653,ECLOGUE II.,
4654,ECLOGUE II.,"It is impossible to take leave of this most beautiful eclogue, without"
4655,ECLOGUE II.,paying the tribute of admiration so justly due to the following nervous
4656,ECLOGUE II.,lines:
4657,ECLOGUE II.,
4658,ECLOGUE II.,"""What if the lion in his rage I meet!----"
4659,ECLOGUE II.,Oft in the dust I view his printed feet:
4660,ECLOGUE II.,"And, fearful! oft, when day's declining light"
4661,ECLOGUE II.,"Yields her pale empire to the mourner night,"
4662,ECLOGUE II.,"By hunger roused, he scours the groaning plain,"
4663,ECLOGUE II.,Gaunt wolves and sullen tigers in his train:
4664,ECLOGUE II.,"Before them death with shrieks directs their way,"
4665,ECLOGUE II.,"Fills the wild yell, and leads them to their prey."""
4666,ECLOGUE II.,
4667,ECLOGUE II.,"This, amongst many other passages to be met with in the writings of"
4668,ECLOGUE II.,"Collins, shows that his genius was perfectly capable of the grand and"
4669,ECLOGUE II.,"magnificent in description, notwithstanding what a learned writer has"
4670,ECLOGUE II.,"advanced to the contrary. Nothing, certainly, could be more greatly"
4671,ECLOGUE II.,"conceived, or more adequately expressed, than the image in the last"
4672,ECLOGUE II.,couplet.
4673,ECLOGUE II.,
4674,ECLOGUE II.,"The deception, sometimes used in rhetoric and poetry, which presents us"
4675,ECLOGUE II.,"with an object or sentiment contrary to what we expected, is here"
4676,ECLOGUE II.,introduced to the greatest advantage:
4677,ECLOGUE II.,
4678,ECLOGUE II.,"""Farewell the youth, whom sighs could not detain,"
4679,ECLOGUE II.,Whom Zara's breaking heart implored in vain!
4680,ECLOGUE II.,"Yet, as thou go'st, may every blast arise----"
4681,ECLOGUE II.,"Weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs!"""
4682,ECLOGUE II.,
4683,ECLOGUE II.,"But this, perhaps, is rather an artificial prettiness, than a real or"
4684,ECLOGUE II.,natural beauty.

4692,ECLOGUE III.,"That innocence, and native simplicity of manners, which, in the first"
4693,ECLOGUE III.,"eclogue, was allowed to constitute the happiness of love, is here"
4694,ECLOGUE III.,beautifully described in its effects. The sultan of Persia marries a
4695,ECLOGUE III.,"Georgian shepherdess, and finds in her embraces that genuine felicity"
4696,ECLOGUE III.,which unperverted nature alone can bestow. The most natural and
4697,ECLOGUE III.,beautiful parts of this eclogue are those where the fair sultana refers
4698,ECLOGUE III.,"with so much pleasure to her pastoral amusements, and those scenes of"
4699,ECLOGUE III.,happy innocence in which she had passed her early years; particularly
4700,ECLOGUE III.,"when, upon her first departure,"
4701,ECLOGUE III.,
4702,ECLOGUE III.,"""Oft as she went, she backward turned her view,"
4703,ECLOGUE III.,"And bade that crook and bleating flock adieu."""
4704,ECLOGUE III.,
4705,ECLOGUE III.,This picture of amiable simplicity reminds one of that passage where
4706,ECLOGUE III.,"Proserpine, when carried off by Pluto, regrets the loss of the flowers"
4707,ECLOGUE III.,she has been gathering:
4708,ECLOGUE III.,
4709,ECLOGUE III.,"""Collecti flores tunicis cecidere remissis:"

4719,ECLOGUE IV.,The beautiful but unfortunate country where the scene of this pathetic
4720,ECLOGUE IV.,"eclogue is laid, had been recently torn in pieces by the depredations of"
4721,ECLOGUE IV.,"its savage neighbours, when Mr. Collins so affectingly described its"
4722,ECLOGUE IV.,"misfortunes. This ingenious man had not only a pencil to portray, but a"
4723,ECLOGUE IV.,heart to feel for the miseries of mankind; and it is with the utmost
4724,ECLOGUE IV.,tenderness and humanity he enters into the narrative of Circassia's
4725,ECLOGUE IV.,"ruin, while he realizes the scene, and brings the present drama before"
4726,ECLOGUE IV.,us. Of every circumstance that could possibly contribute to the tender
4727,ECLOGUE IV.,"effect this pastoral was designed to produce, the poet has availed"
4728,ECLOGUE IV.,himself with the utmost art and address. Thus he prepares the heart to
4729,ECLOGUE IV.,"pity the distresses of Circassia, by representing it as the scene of the"
4730,ECLOGUE IV.,happiest love:
4731,ECLOGUE IV.,
4732,ECLOGUE IV.,"""In fair Circassia, where, to love inclined,"
4733,ECLOGUE IV.,"Each swain was blest, for every maid was kind."""
4734,ECLOGUE IV.,
4735,ECLOGUE IV.,"To give the circumstance of the dialogue a more affecting solemnity, he"
4736,ECLOGUE IV.,"makes the time midnight, and describes the two shepherds in the very"
4737,ECLOGUE IV.,act of flight from the destruction that swept over their country:
4738,ECLOGUE IV.,
4739,ECLOGUE IV.,"""Sad o'er the dews, two brother shepherds fled,"
4740,ECLOGUE IV.,"Where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led."""
4741,ECLOGUE IV.,
4742,ECLOGUE IV.,"There is a beauty and propriety in the epithet wildering, which strikes"
4743,ECLOGUE IV.,"us more forcibly, the more we consider it."
4744,ECLOGUE IV.,
4745,ECLOGUE IV.,"The opening of the dialogue is equally happy, natural, and unaffected;"
4746,ECLOGUE IV.,"when one of the shepherds, weary and overcome with the fatigue of"
4747,ECLOGUE IV.,"flight, calls upon his companion to review the length of way they had"
4748,ECLOGUE IV.,"passed. This is certainly painting from nature, and the thoughts,"
4749,ECLOGUE IV.,"however obvious, or destitute of refinement, are perfectly in character."
4750,ECLOGUE IV.,But as the closest pursuit of nature is the surest way to excellence in
4751,ECLOGUE IV.,"general, and to sublimity in particular, in poetical description, so we"
4752,ECLOGUE IV.,find that this simple suggestion of the shepherd is not unattended with
4753,ECLOGUE IV.,magnificence. There is a grandeur and variety in the landscape he
4754,ECLOGUE IV.,describes:
4755,ECLOGUE IV.,
4756,ECLOGUE IV.,"""And first review that long extended plain,"
4757,ECLOGUE IV.,"And yon wide groves, already past with pain!"
4758,ECLOGUE IV.,"Yon ragged cliff, whose dangerous path we tried!"
4759,ECLOGUE IV.,"And, last, this lofty mountain's weary side!"""
4760,ECLOGUE IV.,
4761,ECLOGUE IV.,"There is, in imitative harmony, an act of expressing a slow and"
4762,ECLOGUE IV.,difficult movement by adding to the usual number of pauses in a verse.
4763,ECLOGUE IV.,This is observable in the line that describes the ascent of the
4764,ECLOGUE IV.,mountain:
4765,ECLOGUE IV.,
4766,ECLOGUE IV.,And last || this lofty mountain's || weary side ||.
4767,ECLOGUE IV.,
4768,ECLOGUE IV.,"Here we find the number of pauses, or musical bars, which, in an heroic"
4769,ECLOGUE IV.,"verse, is commonly two, increased to three."
4770,ECLOGUE IV.,
4771,ECLOGUE IV.,"The liquid melody, and the numerous sweetness of expression, in the"
4772,ECLOGUE IV.,"following descriptive lines, is almost inimitably beautiful:"
4773,ECLOGUE IV.,
4774,ECLOGUE IV.,"""Sweet to the sight is Zabran's flowery plain,"
4775,ECLOGUE IV.,And once by nymphs and shepherds loved in vain!
4776,ECLOGUE IV.,No more the virgins shall delight to rove
4777,ECLOGUE IV.,"By Sargis' banks, or Irwan's shady grove;"
4778,ECLOGUE IV.,"On Tarkie's mountain catch the cooling gale,"
4779,ECLOGUE IV.,"Or breathe the sweets of Aly's flowery vale."""
4780,ECLOGUE IV.,
4781,ECLOGUE IV.,"Nevertheless, in this delightful landscape there is an obvious fault;"
4782,ECLOGUE IV.,there is no distinction between the plain of Zabran and the vale of Aly;
4783,ECLOGUE IV.,"they are both flowery, and consequently undiversified. This could not"
4784,ECLOGUE IV.,"proceed from the poet's want of judgment, but from inattention: it had"
4785,ECLOGUE IV.,not occurred to him that he had employed the epithet flowery twice
4786,ECLOGUE IV.,within so short a compass; an oversight which those who are accustomed
4787,ECLOGUE IV.,"to poetical, or, indeed, to any other species of composition, know to be"
4788,ECLOGUE IV.,very possible.
4789,ECLOGUE IV.,
4790,ECLOGUE IV.,"Nothing can be more beautifully conceived, or more pathetically"
4791,ECLOGUE IV.,"expressed, than the shepherd's apprehensions for his fair countrywomen,"
4792,ECLOGUE IV.,exposed to the ravages of the invaders:
4793,ECLOGUE IV.,
4794,ECLOGUE IV.,"""In vain Circassia boasts her spicy groves,"
4795,ECLOGUE IV.,For ever famed for pure and happy loves:
4796,ECLOGUE IV.,"In vain she boasts her fairest of the fair,"
4797,ECLOGUE IV.,"Their eyes' blue languish, and their golden hair!"
4798,ECLOGUE IV.,Those eyes in tears their fruitless grief shall send;
4799,ECLOGUE IV.,"Those hairs the Tartar's cruel hand shall rend."""
4800,ECLOGUE IV.,
4801,ECLOGUE IV.,There is certainly some very powerful charm in the liquid melody of
4802,ECLOGUE IV.,sounds. The editor of these poems could never read or hear the following
4803,ECLOGUE IV.,"verse repeated, without a degree of pleasure otherwise entirely"
4804,ECLOGUE IV.,unaccountable:
4805,ECLOGUE IV.,
4806,ECLOGUE IV.,"""Their eyes' blue languish, and their golden hair."""
4807,ECLOGUE IV.,
4808,ECLOGUE IV.,"Such are the Oriental Eclogues, which we leave with the same kind of"
4809,ECLOGUE IV.,anxious pleasure we feel upon a temporary parting with a beloved
4810,ECLOGUE IV.,friend.

5313,ODE TO EVENING.,
5314,ODE TO EVENING.,The blank ode has for some time solicited admission into the English
5315,ODE TO EVENING.,"poetry; but its efforts, hitherto, seem to have been in vain, at least"
5316,ODE TO EVENING.,"its reception has been no more than partial. It remains a question,"
5317,ODE TO EVENING.,"then, whether there is not something in the nature of blank verse less"
5318,ODE TO EVENING.,"adapted to the lyric than to the heroic measure, since, though it has"
5319,ODE TO EVENING.,"been generally received in the latter, it is yet unadopted in the"
5320,ODE TO EVENING.,"former. In order to discover this, we are to consider the different"
5321,ODE TO EVENING.,modes of these different species of poetry. That of the heroic is
5322,ODE TO EVENING.,uniform; that of the lyric is various; and in these circumstances of
5323,ODE TO EVENING.,uniformity and variety probably lies the cause why blank verse has been
5324,ODE TO EVENING.,"successful in the one, and unacceptable in the other. While it presented"
5325,ODE TO EVENING.,"itself only in one form, it was familiarized to the ear by custom; but"
5326,ODE TO EVENING.,"where it was obliged to assume the different shapes of the lyric muse,"
5327,ODE TO EVENING.,"it seemed still a stranger of uncouth figure, was received rather with"
5328,ODE TO EVENING.,"curiosity than pleasure, and entertained without that ease or"
5329,ODE TO EVENING.,"satisfaction which acquaintance and familiarity produce.--Moreover, the"
5330,ODE TO EVENING.,heroic blank verse obtained a sanction of infinite importance to its
5331,ODE TO EVENING.,"general reception, when it was adopted by one of the greatest poets the"
5332,ODE TO EVENING.,"world ever produced, and was made the vehicle of the noblest poem that"
5333,ODE TO EVENING.,ever was written. When this poem at length extorted that applause which
5334,ODE TO EVENING.,"ignorance and prejudice had united to withhold, the versification soon"
5335,ODE TO EVENING.,"found its imitators, and became more generally successful than even in"
5336,ODE TO EVENING.,those countries from whence it was imported. But lyric blank verse had
5337,ODE TO EVENING.,"met with no such advantages; for Mr. Collins, whose genius and judgment"
5338,ODE TO EVENING.,"in harmony might have given it so powerful an effect, has left us but"
5339,ODE TO EVENING.,one specimen of it in the Ode to Evening.
5340,ODE TO EVENING.,
5341,ODE TO EVENING.,In the choice of his measure he seems to have had in his eye Horace's
5342,ODE TO EVENING.,Ode to Pyrrha; for this ode bears the nearest resemblance to that mixed
5343,ODE TO EVENING.,kind of the asclepiad and pherecratic verse; and that resemblance in
5344,ODE TO EVENING.,"some degree reconciles us to the want of rhyme, while it reminds us of"
5345,ODE TO EVENING.,"those great masters of antiquity, whose works had no need of this"
5346,ODE TO EVENING.,whimsical jingle of sounds.
5347,ODE TO EVENING.,
5348,ODE TO EVENING.,From the following passage one might be induced to think that the poet
5349,ODE TO EVENING.,had it in view to render his subject and his versification suitable to
5350,ODE TO EVENING.,"each other on this occasion, and that, when he addressed himself to the"
5351,ODE TO EVENING.,"sober power of Evening, he had thought proper to lay aside the foppery"
5352,ODE TO EVENING.,of rhyme:
5353,ODE TO EVENING.,
5354,ODE TO EVENING.,"""Now teach me, maid composed,"
5355,ODE TO EVENING.,"To breathe some soften'd strain,"
5356,ODE TO EVENING.,"Whose numbers, stealing through thy darkening vale,"
5357,ODE TO EVENING.,"May not unseemly with its stillness suit,"
5358,ODE TO EVENING.,"As, musing slow, I hail"
5359,ODE TO EVENING.,"Thy genial loved return!"""
5360,ODE TO EVENING.,
5361,ODE TO EVENING.,"But whatever were the numbers or the versification of this ode,"
5362,ODE TO EVENING.,the imagery and enthusiasm it contains could not fail of rendering
5363,ODE TO EVENING.,it delightful. No other of Mr. Collins's odes is more generally
5364,ODE TO EVENING.,characteristic of his genius. In one place we discover his passion
5365,ODE TO EVENING.,for visionary beings:
5366,ODE TO EVENING.,
5367,ODE TO EVENING.,"""For when thy folding-star arising shows"
5368,ODE TO EVENING.,"His paly circlet, at his warning lamp"
5369,ODE TO EVENING.,"The fragrant Hours, and Elves"
5370,ODE TO EVENING.,"Who slept in buds the day,"
5371,ODE TO EVENING.,
5372,ODE TO EVENING.,"And many a Nymph who wreathes her brows with sedge,"
5373,ODE TO EVENING.,"And sheds the freshening dew, and, lovelier still,"
5374,ODE TO EVENING.,"The pensive Pleasures sweet,"
5375,ODE TO EVENING.,"Prepare thy shadowy car."""
5376,ODE TO EVENING.,
5377,ODE TO EVENING.,In another we behold his strong bias to melancholy:
5378,ODE TO EVENING.,
5379,ODE TO EVENING.,"""Then let me rove some wild and heathy scene,"
5380,ODE TO EVENING.,"Or find some ruin 'midst its dreary dells,"
5381,ODE TO EVENING.,Whose walls more awful nod
5382,ODE TO EVENING.,"By thy religious gleams."""
5383,ODE TO EVENING.,
5384,ODE TO EVENING.,Then appears his taste for what is wildly grand and magnificent in
5385,ODE TO EVENING.,"nature; when, prevented by storms from enjoying his evening walk, he"
5386,ODE TO EVENING.,"wishes for a situation,"
5387,ODE TO EVENING.,
5388,ODE TO EVENING.,"""That from the mountain's side"
5389,ODE TO EVENING.,"Views wilds and swelling floods;"""
5390,ODE TO EVENING.,
5391,ODE TO EVENING.,"And through the whole, his invariable attachment to the expression of"
5392,ODE TO EVENING.,painting:
5393,ODE TO EVENING.,
5394,ODE TO EVENING.,"""----and marks o'er all"

5401,ODE TO EVENING.,want of rhyme in it; a circumstance by no means unfavourable to the

5436,AN ODE.,"and bewildered in, uncertainty.--From an enthusiastic warmth of"
5437,AN ODE.,"temper, indeed, we may for a while be encouraged to persist in some"
5438,AN ODE.,"favourite doctrine, or to adhere to some adopted system; but when that"
5439,AN ODE.,"enthusiasm, which is founded on the vivacity of the passions,"
