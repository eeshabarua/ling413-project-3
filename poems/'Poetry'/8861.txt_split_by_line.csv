47,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.
48,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
49,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
50,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,The text of the present issue of Lord Byron's Poetical Works is based on
51,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"that of 'The Works of Lord Byron', in six volumes, 12mo, which was"
52,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,published by John Murray in 1831. That edition followed the text of the
53,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,successive issues of plays and poems which appeared in the author's
54,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"lifetime, and were subject to his own revision, or that of Gifford and"
55,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,other accredited readers. A more or less thorough collation of the
56,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"printed volumes with the MSS. which were at Moore's disposal, yielded a"
57,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,number of variorum readings which have appeared in subsequent editions
58,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,published by John Murray. Fresh collations of the text of individual
59,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"poems with the original MSS. have been made from time to time, with the"
60,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"result that the text of the latest edition (one-vol. 8vo, 1891) includes"
61,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"some emendations, and has been supplemented by additional variants."
62,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"Textual errors of more or less importance, which had crept into the"
63,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"numerous editions which succeeded the seventeen-volume edition of 1832,"
64,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"were in some instances corrected, but in others passed over. For the"
65,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,purposes of the present edition the printed text has been collated with
66,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"all the MSS. which passed through Moore's hands, and, also, for the"
67,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"first time, with MSS. of the following plays and poems, viz. 'English"
68,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"Bards, and Scotch Reviewers'; 'Childe Harold', Canto IV.; 'Don Juan',"
69,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,Cantos VI.-XVI.; 'Werner'; 'The Deformed Transformed'; 'Lara';
70,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,'Parisina'; 'The Prophecy of Dante'; 'The Vision of Judgment'; 'The Age
71,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,of Bronze'; 'The Island'. The only works of any importance which have
72,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"been printed directly from the text of the first edition, without"
73,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"reference to the MSS., are the following, which appeared in 'The"
74,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"Liberal' (1822-23), viz.: 'Heaven and Earth', 'The Blues', and 'Morgante"
75,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,Maggiore'.
76,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
77,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"A new and, it is believed, an improved punctuation has been adopted. In"
78,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"this respect Byron did not profess to prepare his MSS. for the press,"
79,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"and the punctuation, for which Gifford is mainly responsible, has been"
80,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,reconsidered with reference solely to the meaning and interpretation of
81,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,the sentences as they occur.
82,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
83,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"In the 'Hours of Idleness and Other Early Poems', the typography of the"
84,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"first four editions, as a rule, has been preserved. A uniform typography"
85,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,in accordance with modern use has been adopted for all poems of later
86,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"date. Variants, being the readings of one or more MSS. or of successive"
87,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"editions, are printed in italics [as footnotes. text Ed] immediately"
88,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,below the text. They are marked by Roman numerals. Words and lines
89,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,through which the author has drawn his pen in the MSS. or Revises are
90,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,marked 'MS. erased'.
91,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
92,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"Poems and plays are given, so far as possible, in chronological order."
93,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"'Childe Harold' and 'Don Juan', which were written and published in"
94,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"parts, are printed continuously; and minor poems, including the first"
95,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"four satires, have been arranged in groups according to the date of"
96,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"composition. Epigrams and 'jeux d'esprit' have been placed together, in"
97,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"chronological order, towards the end of the sixth volume. A Bibliography"
98,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,of the poems will immediately precede the Index at the close of the
99,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,sixth volume.
100,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
101,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"The edition contains at least thirty hitherto unpublished poems,"
102,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,including fifteen stanzas of the unfinished seventeenth canto of 'Don
103,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"Juan', and a considerable fragment of the third part of 'The Deformed"
104,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,Transformed'. The eleven unpublished poems from MSS. preserved at
105,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"Newstead, which appear in the first volume, are of slight if any"
106,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"literary value, but they reflect with singular clearness and sincerity"
107,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,the temper and aspirations of the tumultuous and moody stripling to whom
108,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"""the numbers came,"" but who wisely abstained from printing them himself."
109,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
110,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"Byron's notes, of which many are published for the first time, and"
111,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"editorial notes, enclosed in brackets, are printed immediately below the"
112,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,variorum readings. The editorial notes are designed solely to supply the
113,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,reader with references to passages in other works illustrative of the
114,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"text, or to interpret expressions and allusions which lapse of time may"
115,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,have rendered obscure.
116,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
117,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,Much of the knowledge requisite for this purpose is to be found in the
118,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"articles of the 'Dictionary of National Biography', to which the fullest"
119,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,acknowledgments are due; and much has been arrived at after long
120,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"research, involving a minute examination of the literature, the"
121,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"magazines, and often the newspapers of the period."
122,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
123,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,Inasmuch as the poems and plays have been before the public for more
124,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"than three quarters of a century, it has not been thought necessary to"
125,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,burden the notes with the eulogies and apologies of the great poets and
126,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"critics who were Byron's contemporaries, and regarded his writings, both"
127,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"for good and evil, for praise and blame, from a different standpoint"
128,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"from ours. Perhaps, even yet, the time has not come for a definite and"
129,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,positive appreciation of his genius. The tide of feeling and opinion
130,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,must ebb and flow many times before his rank and station among the poets
131,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"of all time will be finally adjudged. The splendour of his reputation,"
132,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"which dazzled his own countrymen, and, for the first time, attracted the"
133,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"attention of a contemporary European audience to an English writer, has"
134,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"faded, and belongs to history; but the poet's work remains, inviting a"
135,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,more intimate and a more extended scrutiny than it has hitherto received
136,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,in this country. The reader who cares to make himself acquainted with
137,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"the method of Byron's workmanship, to unravel his allusions, and to"
138,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"follow the tenour of his verse, will, it is hoped, find some assistance"
139,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,in these volumes.
140,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
141,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,I beg to record my especial thanks to the Earl of Lovelace for the use
142,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"of MSS. of his grandfather's poems, including unpublished fragments; for"
143,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,permission to reproduce portraits in his possession; and for valuable
144,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,information and direction in the construction of some of the notes.
145,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
146,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"My grateful acknowledgments are due to Dr. Garnett, C.B., Dr. A. H."
147,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"Murray, Mr. R. E. Graves, and other officials of the British Museum, for"
148,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"invaluable assistance in preparing the notes, and in compiling a"
149,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,bibliography of the poems.
150,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
151,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,I have also to thank Mr. Leslie Stephen and others for important hints
152,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,and suggestions with regard to the interpretation of some obscure
153,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,passages in 'Hints from Horace'.
154,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
155,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"In correcting the proofs for the press, I have had the advantage of the"
156,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"skill and knowledge of my friend Mr. Frank E. Taylor, of Chertsey, to"
157,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,whom my thanks are due.
158,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
159,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"On behalf of the Publisher, I beg to acknowledge with gratitude the"
160,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"kindness of the Lady Dorchester, the Earl Stanhope, Lord Glenesk and Sir"
161,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"Theodore Martin, K.C.B., for permission to examine MSS. in their"
162,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"possession; and of Mrs. Chaworth Musters, for permission to reproduce"
163,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"her miniature of Miss Chaworth, and for other favours. He desires also"
164,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"to acknowledge the generous assistance of Mr. and Miss Webb, of Newstead"
165,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"Abbey, in permitting the publication of MS. poems, and in making"
166,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,transcripts for the press.
167,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,
168,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,"I need hardly add that, throughout the progress of the work, the advice"
169,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,and direct assistance of Mr. John Murray and Mr. R. E. Prothero have
170,PREFACE TO THE POEMS.,been always within my reach. They have my cordial thanks.

4528,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"What grisly forms, the spectre-train of woe,"
4529,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Bid shuddering Nature shrink beneath the blow,"
4530,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"With Resignation wage relentless strife,"
4531,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"While Hope retires appall'd, and clings to life.               10"
4532,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Yet less the pang when, through the tedious hour,"
4533,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Remembrance sheds around her genial power,"
4534,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Calls back the vanish'd days to rapture given,"
4535,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"When Love was bliss, and Beauty form'd our heaven;"
4536,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Or, dear to youth, pourtrays each childish scene,"
4537,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Those fairy bowers, where all in turn have been."
4538,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"As when, through clouds that pour the summer storm,"
4539,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"The orb of day unveils his distant form,"
4540,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Gilds with faint beams the crystal dews of rain
4541,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],And dimly twinkles o'er the watery plain;                      20
4542,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Thus, while the future dark and cheerless gleams,"
4543,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"The Sun of Memory, glowing through my dreams,"
4544,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Though sunk the radiance of his former blaze,"
4545,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"To scenes far distant points his paler rays,"
4546,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Still rules my senses with unbounded sway,"
4547,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],The past confounding with the present day.
4548,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],
4549,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Oft does my heart indulge the rising thought,"
4550,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Which still recurs, unlook'd for and unsought;"
4551,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"My soul to Fancy's fond suggestion yields,"
4552,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],And roams romantic o'er her airy fields.                       30
4553,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Scenes of my youth, develop'd, crowd to view,"
4554,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],To which I long have bade a last adieu!
4555,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Seats of delight, inspiring youthful themes;"
4556,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Friends lost to me, for aye, except in dreams;"
4557,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Some, who in marble prematurely sleep,"
4558,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Whose forms I now remember, but to weep;"
4559,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Some, who yet urge the same scholastic course"

4563,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"These, with a thousand visions, now unite,"
4564,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"To dazzle, though they please, my aching sight. [3]"
4565,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],
4566,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"IDA! blest spot, where Science holds her reign,"
4567,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"How joyous, once, I join'd thy youthful train!"
4568,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Bright, in idea, gleams thy lofty spire,"
4569,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Again, I mingle with thy playful quire;"
4570,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Our tricks of mischief, [4] every childish game,"
4571,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Unchang'd by time or distance, seem the same;"
4572,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Through winding paths, along the glade I trace"
4573,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],The social smile of every welcome face;                        50
4574,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"My wonted haunts, my scenes of joy or woe,"
4575,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Each early boyish friend, or youthful foe,"
4576,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Our feuds dissolv'd, but not my friendship past,--"
4577,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"I bless the former, and forgive the last."
4578,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Hours of my youth! when, nurtur'd in my breast,"
4579,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"To Love a stranger, Friendship made me blest,--"
4580,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Friendship, the dear peculiar bond of youth,"
4581,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],When every artless bosom throbs with truth;
4582,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Untaught by worldly wisdom how to feign,"
4583,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],And check each impulse with prudential rein;                   60
4584,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"When, all we feel, our honest souls disclose,"
4585,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"In love to friends, in open hate to foes;"
4586,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"No varnish'd tales the lips of youth repeat,"
4587,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],No dear-bought knowledge purchased by deceit;
4588,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Hypocrisy, the gift of lengthen'd years,"
4589,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Matured by age, the garb of Prudence wears: [ii]"
4590,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"When, now, the Boy is ripen'd into Man,"
4591,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],His careful Sire chalks forth some wary plan;

4593,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Smoothly to speak, and cautiously to think;                    70"
4594,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Still to assent, and never to deny--"
4595,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],A patron's praise can well reward the lie:
4596,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"And who, when Fortune's warning voice is heard,"
4597,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Would lose his opening prospects for a word?
4598,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Although, against that word, his heart rebel,"
4599,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"And Truth, indignant, all his bosom swell."
4600,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],
4601,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Away with themes like this! not mine the task,"
4602,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],From flattering friends to tear the hateful mask;
4603,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Let keener bards delight in Satire's sting,"
4604,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],My Fancy soars not on Detraction's wing:                       80
4605,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Once, and but once, she aim'd a deadly blow,"
4606,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],To hurl Defiance on a secret Foe;
4607,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"But when that foe, from feeling or from shame,"
4608,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"The cause unknown, yet still to me the same,"
4609,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Warn'd by some friendly hint, perchance, retir'd,"
4610,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],With this submission all her rage expired.
4611,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"From dreaded pangs that feeble Foe to save,"
4612,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"She hush'd her young resentment, and forgave."
4613,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Or, if my Muse a Pedant's portrait drew,"
4614,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],POMPOSUS' [5] virtues are but known to few:                    90
4615,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"I never fear'd the young usurper's nod,"
4616,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"And he who wields must, sometimes, feel the rod."
4617,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"If since on Granta's failings, known to all"

4625,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Who hail'd me chief, [6] obedient to command;                   100"
4626,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Who join'd with me, in every boyish sport,"
4627,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Their first adviser, and their last resort;"
4628,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Nor shrunk beneath the upstart pedant's frown, [iii]"
4629,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Or all the sable glories of his gown; [iv]
4630,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Who, thus, transplanted from his father's school,"
4631,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Unfit to govern, ignorant of rule--"
4632,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Succeeded him, whom all unite to praise,"
4633,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"The dear preceptor of my early days,"
4634,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"PROBUS, [7] the pride of science, and the boast--"

4639,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],From learning's labour is the blest retreat.
4640,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],POMPOSUS fills his magisterial chair;
4641,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"POMPOSUS governs,--but, my Muse, forbear:"
4642,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Contempt, in silence, be the pedant's lot, [vi]"
4643,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],His name and precepts be alike forgot;
4644,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"No more his mention shall my verse degrade,--"
4645,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],To him my tribute is already paid. [8]                         120
4646,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],
4647,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"High, through those elms with hoary branches crown'd [9]"
4648,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Fair IDA'S bower adorns the landscape round;
4649,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"There Science, from her favour'd seat, surveys"
4650,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],The vale where rural Nature claims her praise;
4651,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"To her awhile resigns her youthful train,"
4652,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Who move in joy, and dance along the plain;"

4661,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"While yonder few search out some green retreat,"
4662,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],And arbours shade them from the summer heat:
4663,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Others, again, a pert and lively crew,"
4664,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Some rough and thoughtless stranger plac'd in view,"
4665,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"With frolic quaint their antic jests expose,"
4666,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],And tease the grumbling rustic as he goes;                     140
4667,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Nor rest with this, but many a passing fray"
4668,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Tradition treasures for a future day:
4669,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"""'Twas here the gather'd swains for vengeance fought,"
4670,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],And here we earn'd the conquest dearly bought:
4671,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Here have we fled before superior might,"
4672,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"And here renew'd the wild tumultuous fight."""
4673,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"While thus our souls with early passions swell,"
4674,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],In lingering tones resounds the distant bell;
4675,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Th' allotted hour of daily sport is o'er,"
4676,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],And Learning beckons from her temple's door.                    150
4677,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"No splendid tablets grace her simple hall,"
4678,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],But ruder records fill the dusky wall:

4680,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Secures its owner's academic fame;

4683,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"These shall survive alike when Son and Sire,"
4684,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Beneath one common stroke of fate expire; [10]
4685,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Perhaps, their last memorial these alone,"
4686,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Denied, in death, a monumental stone,                           160"
4687,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Whilst to the gale in mournful cadence wave
4688,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"The sighing weeds, that hide their nameless grave."
4689,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"And, here, my name, and many an early friend's,"
4690,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Along the wall in lengthen'd line extends.
4691,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Though, still, our deeds amuse the youthful race,"
4692,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Who tread our steps, and fill our former place,"

4710,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],The faint remembrance of our fairy realm.
4711,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],
4712,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Dear honest race! though now we meet no more,"
4713,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],One last long look on what we were before--
4714,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Our first kind greetings, and our last adieu--"
4715,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Drew tears from eyes unus'd to weep with you.
4716,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Through splendid circles, Fashion's gaudy world,"
4717,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Where Folly's glaring standard waves unfurl'd,                  190"
4718,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"I plung'd to drown in noise my fond regret,"
4719,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],And all I sought or hop'd was to forget:
4720,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Vain wish! if, chance, some well-remember'd face,"
4721,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Some old companion of my early race,"
4722,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Advanc'd to claim his friend with honest joy,"
4723,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"My eyes, my heart, proclaim'd me still a boy;"
4724,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"The glittering scene, the fluttering groups around,"
4725,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Were quite forgotten when my friend was found;
4726,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"The smiles of Beauty, (for, alas! I've known"
4727,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],What 'tis to bend before Love's mighty throne;)                 200
4728,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"The smiles of Beauty, though those smiles were dear,"
4729,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Could hardly charm me, when that friend was near:"
4730,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"My thoughts bewilder'd in the fond surprise,"
4731,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],The woods of IDA danc'd before my eyes;
4732,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"I saw the sprightly wand'rers pour along,"
4733,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"I saw, and join'd again the joyous throng;"
4734,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Panting, again I trac'd her lofty grove,"
4735,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],And Friendship's feelings triumph'd over Love.
4736,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],
4737,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Yet, why should I alone with such delight"
4738,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Retrace the circuit of my former flight?                        210
4739,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Is there no cause beyond the common claim,"
4740,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Endear'd to all in childhood's very name?
4741,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Ah! sure some stronger impulse vibrates here,"
4742,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Which whispers friendship will be doubly dear
4743,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"To one, who thus for kindred hearts must roam,"
4744,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"And seek abroad, the love denied at home."
4745,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Those hearts, dear IDA, have I found in thee,"
4746,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"A home, a world, a paradise to me."
4747,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],Stern Death forbade my orphan youth to share
4748,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],The tender guidance of a Father's care;                         220
4749,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Can Rank, or e'en a Guardian's name supply"
4750,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"The love, which glistens in a Father's eye?"
4751,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"For this, can Wealth, or Title's sound atone,"
4752,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Made, by a Parent's early loss, my own?"
4753,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],What Brother springs a Brother's love to seek?
4754,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],What Sister's gentle kiss has prest my cheek?
4755,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"For me, how dull the vacant moments rise,"
4756,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],To no fond bosom link'd by kindred ties!
4757,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Oft, in the progress of some fleeting dream,"
4758,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Fraternal smiles, collected round me seem;                      230"
4759,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"While still the visions to my heart are prest,"
4760,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],The voice of Love will murmur in my rest:
4761,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],I hear--I wake--and in the sound rejoice!
4762,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"I hear again,--but, ah! no Brother's voice."
4763,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"A Hermit, 'midst of crowds, I fain must stray"
4764,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Alone, though thousand pilgrims fill the way;"
4765,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"While these a thousand kindred wreaths entwine,"
4766,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],I cannot call one single blossom mine:
4767,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"What then remains? in solitude to groan,"
4768,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"To mix in friendship, or to sigh alone?                         240"
4769,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Thus, must I cling to some endearing hand,"
4770,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"And none more dear, than IDA'S social band."
4771,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],
4772,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Alonzo! [11] best and dearest of my friends, [vii]"
4773,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Thy name ennobles him, who thus commends:"
4774,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],From this fond tribute thou canst gain no praise;
4775,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"The praise is his, who now that tribute pays."
4776,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],"Oh! in the promise of thy early youth,"
4777,CHILDISH RECOLLECTIONS. [1],If Hope anticipate the words of Truth!

6421,DAMÆTAS. [1],"In law an infant, [2] and in years a boy,"
6422,DAMÆTAS. [1],In mind a slave to every vicious joy;
6423,DAMÆTAS. [1],"From every sense of shame and virtue wean'd,"

6433,DAMÆTAS. [1],"But, pall'd with vice, he breaks his former chain,"

6460,TO MARION. [1],MARION! why that pensive brow? [i]
6461,TO MARION. [1],What disgust to life hast thou?
6462,TO MARION. [1],Change that discontented air;
6463,TO MARION. [1],Frowns become not one so fair.
6464,TO MARION. [1],"'Tis not Love disturbs thy rest,"
6465,TO MARION. [1],Love's a stranger to thy breast:
6466,TO MARION. [1],"_He_, in dimpling smiles, appears,"
6467,TO MARION. [1],Or mourns in sweetly timid tears;
6468,TO MARION. [1],"Or bends the languid eyelid down,"
6469,TO MARION. [1],But _shuns_ the cold forbidding 'frown'.
6470,TO MARION. [1],"Then resume thy former fire,"
6471,TO MARION. [1],"Some will _love_, and all admire!"
6472,TO MARION. [1],"While that icy aspect chills us,"
6473,TO MARION. [1],Nought but cool Indiff'rence thrills us.
6474,TO MARION. [1],"Would'st thou wand'ring hearts beguile,"
6475,TO MARION. [1],"Smile, at least, or _seem_ to _smile_;"
6476,TO MARION. [1],Eyes like _thine_ were never meant
6477,TO MARION. [1],To hide their orbs in dark restraint;
6478,TO MARION. [1],"Spite of all thou fain wouldst say,"
6479,TO MARION. [1],Still in _truant_ beams they play.
6480,TO MARION. [1],Thy lips--but here my _modest_ Muse
6481,TO MARION. [1],Her impulse _chaste_ must needs refuse:
6482,TO MARION. [1],"She _blushes, curtsies, frowns,_--in short She"
6483,TO MARION. [1],Dreads lest the _Subject_ should transport me;
6484,TO MARION. [1],"And flying off, in search of _Reason_,"
6485,TO MARION. [1],Brings Prudence back in proper season.
6486,TO MARION. [1],"_All_ I shall, therefore, say (whate'er [ii]"
6487,TO MARION. [1],"I think, is neither here nor there,)"
6488,TO MARION. [1],"Is, that such _lips_, of looks endearing,"
6489,TO MARION. [1],Were form'd for _better things_ than _sneering_.
6490,TO MARION. [1],"Of soothing compliments divested,"
6491,TO MARION. [1],Advice at least's disinterested;
6492,TO MARION. [1],"Such is my artless song to thee,"
6493,TO MARION. [1],From all the flow of Flatt'ry free;
6494,TO MARION. [1],"Counsel like _mine_ is as a brother's,"
6495,TO MARION. [1],_My_ heart is given to some others;
6496,TO MARION. [1],"That is to say, unskill'd to cozen,"
6497,TO MARION. [1],It shares itself among a dozen.

6502,TO MARION. [1],"To those who think remonstrance teazing,"
6503,TO MARION. [1],"At once I'll tell thee our opinion,"
6504,TO MARION. [1],Concerning Woman's soft Dominion:
6505,TO MARION. [1],"Howe'er we gaze, with admiration,"
6506,TO MARION. [1],On eyes of blue or lips carnation;
6507,TO MARION. [1],"Howe'er the flowing locks attract us,"
6508,TO MARION. [1],Howe'er those beauties may distract us;
6509,TO MARION. [1],"Still fickle, we are prone to rove,"
6510,TO MARION. [1],_These_ cannot fix our souls to love;
6511,TO MARION. [1],"It is not too _severe_ a stricture,"
6512,TO MARION. [1],To say they form a _pretty picture_;
6513,TO MARION. [1],"But would'st thou see the secret chain,"
6514,TO MARION. [1],"Which binds us in your humble train,"

6724,OSCAR OF ALVA. [1],It soothed the father's feudal pride

8567,"AN IMITATION OF MACPHERSON'S ""OSSIAN"". [2]",glitters on the head of Orla: but a spear pierced his eye. His brain
8568,"AN IMITATION OF MACPHERSON'S ""OSSIAN"". [2]","gushes through the wound, and foams on the spear of Calmar. As roll the"

8574,"AN IMITATION OF MACPHERSON'S ""OSSIAN"". [2]",bounds in joy. Ossian stalks in his arms. Oscar shakes the spear. The
8575,"AN IMITATION OF MACPHERSON'S ""OSSIAN"". [2]",eagle wing of Fillan floats on the wind. Dreadful is the clang of death!
8576,"AN IMITATION OF MACPHERSON'S ""OSSIAN"". [2]",many are the Widows of Lochlin. Morven prevails in its strength.
8577,"AN IMITATION OF MACPHERSON'S ""OSSIAN"". [2]",
8578,"AN IMITATION OF MACPHERSON'S ""OSSIAN"". [2]",Morn glimmers on the hills: no living foe is seen; but the sleepers are

13590,PREFACE [1],publish his opinion if he pleases; and the Authors I have endeavoured to
13591,PREFACE [1],commemorate may do by me as I have done by them. I dare say they will

13601,PREFACE [1],"In the First Edition of this Satire, published anonymously, fourteen"
13602,PREFACE [1],"lines on the subject of Bowles's Pope were written by, and inserted at"
13603,PREFACE [1],"the request of, an ingenious friend of mine, [2] who has now in the"
13604,PREFACE [1],"press a volume of Poetry. In the present Edition they are erased, and"
13605,PREFACE [1],some of my own substituted in their stead; my only reason for this being
13606,PREFACE [1],that which I conceive would operate with any other person in the same
13607,PREFACE [1],"manner,--a determination not to publish with my name any production,"
13608,PREFACE [1],which was not entirely and exclusively my own composition.
13609,PREFACE [1],
13610,PREFACE [1],With [3] regard to the real talents of many of the poetical persons
13611,PREFACE [1],"whose performances are mentioned or alluded to in the following pages,"
13612,PREFACE [1],it is presumed by the Author that there can be little difference of
13613,PREFACE [1],"opinion in the Public at large; though, like other sectaries, each has"
13614,PREFACE [1],"his separate tabernacle of proselytes, by whom his abilities are"
13615,PREFACE [1],"over-rated, his faults overlooked, and his metrical canons received"
13616,PREFACE [1],without scruple and without consideration. But the unquestionable
13617,PREFACE [1],possession of considerable genius by several of the writers here
13618,PREFACE [1],censured renders their mental prostitution more to be regretted.
13619,PREFACE [1],"Imbecility may be pitied, or, at worst, laughed at and forgotten;"
13620,PREFACE [1],perverted powers demand the most decided reprehension. No one can wish
13621,PREFACE [1],more than the Author that some known and able writer had undertaken
13622,PREFACE [1],"their exposure; but Mr. Gifford has devoted himself to Massinger, and,"
13623,PREFACE [1],"in the absence of the regular physician, a country practitioner may, in"
13624,PREFACE [1],"cases of absolute necessity, be allowed to prescribe his nostrum to"
13625,PREFACE [1],"prevent the extension of so deplorable an epidemic, provided there be no"
13626,PREFACE [1],quackery in his treatment of the malady. A caustic is here offered; as
13627,PREFACE [1],it is to be feared nothing short of actual cautery can recover the
13628,PREFACE [1],numerous patients afflicted with the present prevalent and distressing
13629,PREFACE [1],"rabies for rhyming.--As to the' Edinburgh Reviewers', it would indeed"
13630,PREFACE [1],require an Hercules to crush the Hydra; but if the Author succeeds in
13631,PREFACE [1],"merely ""bruising one of the heads of the serpent"" though his own hand"
13632,PREFACE [1],"should suffer in the encounter, he will be amply satisfied."

17763,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"Dallas, January 12, 1867, and are, doubtless, fragments of the proofs"
17764,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"set up in type for Cawthorn in 1811. They are in ""book-form,"" and show"
17765,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,that the volume was intended to be uniform with the Fifth Edition of
17766,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"'English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers', of 1811. The text corresponds"
17767,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"closely but not exactly with that adopted by Murray in 1831, and does"
17768,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,not embody the variants of the several MSS. It is probable that complete
17769,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,proofs were in Moore's possession at the time when he included the
17770,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"selections from the 'Hints' in his 'Letters and Journals', pp. 263-269,"
17771,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,and that the text of the entire poem as published in 1831 was derived
17772,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"from this source. Selections, numbering in all 156 lines, had already"
17773,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"appeared in 'Recollections of the Life of Lord Byron', by R. C. Dallas,"
17774,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"1824, pp. 104-113. Byron, estimating the merit by the difficulty of the"
17775,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"performance, rated the 'Hints from Horace' extravagantly high. He only"
17776,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"forbore to publish them after the success of 'Childe Harold', because he"
17777,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"felt, as he states, that he should be ""heaping coals of fire upon his"
17778,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"head"" if he were in his hour of triumph to put forth a sequel to a"
17779,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"lampoon provoked by failure. Nine years afterwards, when he resolved to"
17780,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"print the work with some omissions, he gravely maintained that it"
17781,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"excelled the productions of his mature genius. ""As far,"" he said, ""as"
17782,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"versification goes, it is good; and on looking back at what I wrote"
17783,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"about that period, I am astonished to see how little I have trained on."
17784,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,I wrote better then than now; but that comes of my having fallen into
17785,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"the atrocious bad taste of the times"" [September 23, 1820]. The opinion"
17786,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"of J. C. Hobhouse that the 'Hints' would require ""a good deal of"
17787,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"slashing"" to adapt them to the passing hour, and other considerations,"
17788,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,again led Byron to suspend the publication. Authors are frequently bad
17789,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"judges of their own works, but of all the literary hallucinations upon"
17790,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,record there are none which exceed the mistaken preferences of Lord
17791,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,Byron. Shortly after the appearance of 'The Corsair' he fancied that
17792,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,'English Bards' was still his masterpiece; when all his greatest works
17793,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"had been produced, he contended that his translation from Pulci was his"
17794,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,"""grand performance,--the best thing he ever did in his life;"" and"
17795,INTRODUCTION TO HINTS FROM HORACE,throughout the whole of his literary career he regarded these 'Hints

21904,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',
21905,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"Byron spent the autumn of 1812 ""by the waters of Cheltenham,"" and,"
21906,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',besides writing to order his 'Song of Drury Lane' (the address spoken at
21907,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"the opening of the theatre, Oct. 10, 1812), he put in hand a 'Satire on"
21908,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"Waltzing'. It was published anonymously in the following spring; but,"
21909,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"possibly, because it was somewhat coolly received, he told Murray (April"
21910,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"21, 1813) ""to contradict the report that he was the author of a certain"
21911,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"malicious publication on waltzing."" In his memoranda ""chiefly with"
21912,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"reference to my Byron,"" Moore notes ""Byron's hatred of waltzing,"" and"
21913,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"records a passage of arms between ""the lame boy"" and Mary Chaworth,"
21914,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"which arose from her ""dancing with some person who was unknown to her."""
21915,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"Then, and always, he must have experienced the bitter sense of exclusion"
21916,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',from active amusements; but it is a hasty assumption that Byron only
21917,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',denounced waltzing because he was unable to waltz himself. To modern
21918,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"sentiment, on the moral side, waltzing is unassailable; but the first"
21919,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"impressions of spectators, to whom it was a novelty, were distinctly"
21920,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',unfavourable.
21921,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',
21922,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"In a letter from Germany (May 17, 1799) Coleridge describes a dance"
21923,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',round the maypole at Rübeland.
21924,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',
21925,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"""The dances were reels and the waltzes, but chiefly the latter; this"
21926,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"dance is in the higher circles sufficiently voluptuous, but here the"
21927,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"motions of it were 'far' more faithful interpreters of the passions."""
21928,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',
21929,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"A year later, H.C. Robinson, writing from Frankfort in 1800 ('Diary and"
21930,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"Letters', i. 76), says, ""The dancing is unlike anything you ever saw."
21931,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"You must have heard of it under the name of waltzing, that is rolling"
21932,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"and turning, though the rolling is not horizontal but perpendicular. Yet"
21933,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"Werther, after describing his first waltz with Charlotte, says, and I"
21934,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"say so too, 'I felt that if I were married my wife should waltz (or"
21935,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"roll) with no one but myself.'"" Ten years later, Gillray publishes a"
21936,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"caricature of the waltz, as a French dance, which he styles, ""Le bon"
21937,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"Genre."" It is not a pretty picture. By degrees, however, and with some"
21938,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"reluctance, society yielded to the fascinations of the stranger."

21941,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"of Viscount Melbourne', by W.T. McCullagh Torrens, i. 105), ""wanted to"
21942,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',have waltzes and quadrilles; and at Devonshire House it could not be
21943,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"allowed, so we had them in the great drawing-room at Whitehall. All"

21947,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"""No event,"" says Thomas Raikes ('Personal Reminiscences', p. 284), ever"
21948,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',produced so great a sensation in English society as the introduction of
21949,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"the German waltz.... Old and young returned to school, and the mornings"
21950,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',were now absorbed at home in practising the figures of a French
21951,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',quadrille or whirling a chair round the room to learn the step and
21952,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"measure of the German waltz. The anti-waltzing party took the alarm,"
21953,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"cried it down; mothers forbad it, and every ballroom became a scene of"
21954,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',feud and contention. The foreigners were not idle in forming their
21955,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"'élèves'; Baron Tripp, Neumann, St. Aldegonde, etc., persevered in spite"

21957,INTRODUCTION TO 'THE WALTZ',"however, till Byron's ""malicious publication"" had been issued and"
