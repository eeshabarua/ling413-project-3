166,INTRODUCTION,
167,INTRODUCTION,
168,INTRODUCTION,"THIRTY years have passed, like a watch in the night, since the earlier of"
169,INTRODUCTION,"the two sets of verses here reprinted, _Ballades in Blue China_, was"
170,INTRODUCTION,published.  At first there were but twenty-two _Ballades_; ten more were
171,INTRODUCTION,"added later.  They appeared in a little white vellum wrapper, with a"
172,INTRODUCTION,little blue Chinese singer copied from a porcelain jar; and the
173,INTRODUCTION,frontispiece was a little design by an etcher now famous.
174,INTRODUCTION,
175,INTRODUCTION,"Thirty years ago blue china was a kind of fetish in some circles,"
176,INTRODUCTION,"æsthetic circles, of which the balladist was not a member."
177,INTRODUCTION,
178,INTRODUCTION,"The _ballade_ was an old French form of verse, in France revived by"
179,INTRODUCTION,"Théodore de Banville, and restored to an England which had long forgotten"
180,INTRODUCTION,"the Middle Ages, by my friends Mr. Austin Dobson and Mr. Edmund Gosse."
181,INTRODUCTION,"They, so far as I can trust my memory, were the first to reintroduce"
182,INTRODUCTION,"these pleasant old French _nugae_, while an anonymous author let loose"
183,INTRODUCTION,upon the town a whole winged flock of _ballades_ of amazing dexterity.
184,INTRODUCTION,This unknown balladist was Mr. Henley; perhaps he was the first
185,INTRODUCTION,"Englishman who ever burst into a _double ballade_, and his translations"
186,INTRODUCTION,of two of Villon’s ballades into modern thieves’ slang were marvels of
187,INTRODUCTION,"dexterity.  Mr. Swinburne wrote a serious _ballade_, but the form, I"
188,INTRODUCTION,"venture to think, is not ‘wholly serious,’ of its nature, in modern days;"
189,INTRODUCTION,and he did not persevere.  Nor did the taste for these trifles long
190,INTRODUCTION,"endure.  A good _ballade_ is almost as rare as a good sonnet, but a"
191,INTRODUCTION,middling _ballade_ is almost as easily written as the majority of
192,INTRODUCTION,"sonnets.  Either form readily becomes mechanical, cheap and facile.  I"
193,INTRODUCTION,"have heard Mr. George Meredith improvise a sonnet, a Petrarchian sonnet,"
194,INTRODUCTION,"obedient to the rules, without pen and paper.  He spoke ‘and the numbers"
195,INTRODUCTION,"came’; he sonneted as easily as a living poet, in his Eton days,"
196,INTRODUCTION,improvised Latin elegiacs and Greek hexameters.
197,INTRODUCTION,
198,INTRODUCTION,The sonnet endures.  Mr. Horace Hutchinson wrote somewhere: “When you
199,INTRODUCTION,"have read a sonnet, you feel that though there does not seem to be much"
200,INTRODUCTION,"of it, you have done a good deal, as when you have eaten a cold"
201,INTRODUCTION,"hard-boiled egg.”  Still people keep on writing sonnets, because the"
202,INTRODUCTION,sonnet is wholly serious.  In an English sonnet you cannot easily be
203,INTRODUCTION,flippant of pen.  A few great poets have written immortal sonnets—among
204,INTRODUCTION,"them are Milton, Wordsworth, and Keats.  Thus the sonnet is a thing which"
205,INTRODUCTION,"every poet thinks it worth while to try at; like Felix Arvers, he may be"
206,INTRODUCTION,made immortal by a single sonnet.  Even I have written one too many!
207,INTRODUCTION,Every anthologist wants to anthologise it (_The Odyssey_); it never was a
208,INTRODUCTION,"favourite of my own, though it had the honour to be kindly spoken of by"
209,INTRODUCTION,Mr. Matthew Arnold.
210,INTRODUCTION,
211,INTRODUCTION,"On the other hand, no man since François Villon has been immortalised by"
212,INTRODUCTION,a single ballade—_Mais où sont les neiges d’antan_?
213,INTRODUCTION,
214,INTRODUCTION,To speak in any detail about these poor ballades would be to indite a
215,INTRODUCTION,"part of an autobiography.  Looking back at the little book, ‘what"
216,INTRODUCTION,memories it stirs’ in one to whom
217,INTRODUCTION,
218,INTRODUCTION,"‘Fate has done this wrong,"
219,INTRODUCTION,That I should write too much and live too long.’
220,INTRODUCTION,
221,INTRODUCTION,"_The Ballade of the Tweed_, and the _Rhymes à la Mode_, were dedicated to"
222,INTRODUCTION,"the dearest of kinsmen, a cricketer and angler.  The _Ballade of"
223,INTRODUCTION,"Roulette_ was inscribed to R. R., a gallant veteran of the Indian Mutiny,"
224,INTRODUCTION,"a leader of Light Horse, whose father was a friend of Sir Walter Scott."
225,INTRODUCTION,"He was himself a Borderer, in whose defeats on the green field of"
226,INTRODUCTION,"Roulette I often shared, long, long ago."
227,INTRODUCTION,
228,INTRODUCTION,So many have gone ‘into the world of light’ that it is a happiness to
229,INTRODUCTION,"think of him to whom _The Ballade of Golf_ was dedicated, and to remember"
230,INTRODUCTION,"that he is still capable of scoring his double century at cricket, and of"
231,INTRODUCTION,lifting the ball high over the trees beyond the boundaries of a great
232,INTRODUCTION,cricket-field.  Perhaps Mr. Leslie Balfour-Melville will pardon me for
233,INTRODUCTION,"mentioning his name, linked as it is with so many common memories.  ‘One"
234,INTRODUCTION,is taken and another left.’
235,INTRODUCTION,
236,INTRODUCTION,A different sort of memory attaches itself to _A Ballade of Dead Cities_.
237,INTRODUCTION,"It was written in a Theocritean amoebean way, in competition with Mr."
238,INTRODUCTION,"Edmund Gosse; he need not be ashamed of the circumstance, for another"
239,INTRODUCTION,"shepherd, who was umpire, awarded the prize (two kids just severed from"
240,INTRODUCTION,their dams) to his victorious muse.
241,INTRODUCTION,
242,INTRODUCTION,"The _Ballade of the Midnight Forest_, the Ballade of the Huntress"
243,INTRODUCTION,"Artemis, was translated from Théodore de Banville, whose beautiful poem"
244,INTRODUCTION,"came so near the Greek, that when the late Provost of Oriel translated a"
245,INTRODUCTION,"part of its English shadow into Greek hexameters, you might suppose, as"
246,INTRODUCTION,"you read, that they were part of a lost Homeric Hymn."
247,INTRODUCTION,
248,INTRODUCTION,"I never wrote a _double ballade_, and stanzas four and five of the"
249,INTRODUCTION,_Double Ballade of Primitive Man_ were contributed by the learned _doyen_
250,INTRODUCTION,"of Anthropology, Mr. E. B. Tylor, author of Primitive Culture."
251,INTRODUCTION,
252,INTRODUCTION,_À tout seigneur tout honneur_!
253,INTRODUCTION,
254,INTRODUCTION,"In _Ballade of his Choice of a Sepulchre_, the Windburg is a hill in"
255,INTRODUCTION,Teviotdale.  _A Portrait of 1783_ was written on a French engraving after
256,INTRODUCTION,"Morland, and _Benedetta Ramus_ was addressed to a mezzotint (an artist’s"
257,INTRODUCTION,"proof, ‘very rare’).  It is after Romney and is ‘My Beauty,’ as Charles"
258,INTRODUCTION,"Lamb said (once, unluckily, to a Scot) of an engraving, after Lionardo,"
259,INTRODUCTION,of some fair dead lady.
260,INTRODUCTION,
261,INTRODUCTION,"The sonnet, _Natural Theology_, is the germ of what the author has since"
262,INTRODUCTION,"written, in _The Making of Religion_, on the long neglected fact that"
263,INTRODUCTION,many of the lowest savages known share the belief in a benevolent All
264,INTRODUCTION,Father and Judge of men.
265,INTRODUCTION,
266,INTRODUCTION,"Concerning verses in _Rhymes à la Mode_, visitors to St. Andrews may be"
267,INTRODUCTION,"warned not to visit St. Leonard’s Chapel, described in the second stanza"
268,INTRODUCTION,"of _Almae Matres_.  In the writer’s youth, and even in middle age,"

273,INTRODUCTION,
274,INTRODUCTION,The once beautiful ruins carpeted with grass and wild flowers have been
275,INTRODUCTION,"doubly desecrated by persons, academic persons, having authority and a"
276,INTRODUCTION,"plentiful lack of taste.  The slim mountain-ashes, fair as the young"
277,INTRODUCTION,"palm-tree that Odysseus saw beside the shrine of Apollo in Delos, have"
278,INTRODUCTION,been cut down by the academic persons to whom power is given.  The grass
279,INTRODUCTION,and flowers have been rooted up.  Hideous little wooden fences enclose
280,INTRODUCTION,the grave slabs: a roof of a massive kind has been dumped down on the old
281,INTRODUCTION,"walls, and the windows, once so graceful in their airy lines, have been"
282,INTRODUCTION,"glazed in a horrible manner, while the ugly iron gate precludes entrance"
283,INTRODUCTION,to a shrine which is now a black and dismal dungeon.
284,INTRODUCTION,

2355,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Amid the soft dusk suddenly

2423,A DREAM IN JUNE.,The rosy bonds fell down from me
2424,A DREAM IN JUNE.,"Who, being innocent, was free;"
2425,A DREAM IN JUNE.,And I might wander at my will

2429,A DREAM IN JUNE.,Hued like the webs that Twilight weaves
2430,A DREAM IN JUNE.,At shut of languid summer eves
2431,A DREAM IN JUNE.,So light their raiment seemed; and glad
