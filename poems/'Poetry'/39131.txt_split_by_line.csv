282,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,They came as softly up the stairs
283,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,As you could creep.
284,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,
285,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"They whispered in the doorway there,"
286,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,And looked at us awhile.
287,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,I had my eyes shut up; but I
288,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Could feel him smile.
289,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,
290,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I shut my eyes up close, and lay"
291,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,As still as I could keep;
292,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Because I knew he wanted us
293,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,To be asleep.

307,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,
308,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"He took me to some Music once,"

331,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,
332,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"The land was running from the train,"

335,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And then it all looked flat and still,"

337,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,
338,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I saw the windows and the spires,"

340,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,
341,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And fences, running up and down;"

352,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"We crossed the bridges with a roar,"
353,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Then hummed, the way we went before."
354,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,
355,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,And tunnels made it dark and light
356,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Like open-work of day and night.
357,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,
358,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Until I saw the chimneys rise,"

377,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"They dip, and coo, and move as slow,"
378,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,All so soft and proud!
379,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,You can see the wavy specks
380,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Of bubble-color on their necks;
381,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"--Little, little Cloud."

386,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Gold and rosy, too."
387,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,And they talk as Bubbles could
388,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,If they only ever would

391,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"--Till you try to catch one so,"
392,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Just to make it stay
393,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"While the colors turn. But Oh,"
394,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Then they fly away!--
395,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"All at once, two, three, four, five--"
396,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Like a snowstorm all alive,--"

424,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Yes, some have hair that waves and clings,"

435,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,The way I hum around a song
436,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,More things than really do belong.

539,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,And I can't remember thinking;
540,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,And I should think I ought.
541,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I wasn't sleeping, either:"

543,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,I saw things out of both my eyes.
544,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,I wonder where I was.

546,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Now I'm back, I see them"

548,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And the noise, together,"
549,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Makes a purring sound.
550,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,But I know Something More
551,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Than just awhile ago.
552,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,I know Something More!--
553,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,I wonder what I know.

567,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Of everything you'd like to see;
568,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,But nothing live is there:

570,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And Rabbits, by their little feet!--"
571,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,And no one seemed to care.

573,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And there were Fishes out in rows,"

582,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Only its eyes were blurred;
583,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And hanging by it, very near,"
584,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,A beautiful great Bird.
585,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"So I could smooth his feathers through,"

632,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,With all so much of what you want
633,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,In both your pockets and your hand.

641,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"It must be fun to count them out,"
642,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,With One for You and One for Me;
643,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And yet it stays so doleful there,"
644,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"--For all the People going by,--"
645,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And breathing frosty on the air,"
646,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Like something trying not to cry.
647,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,
648,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,--It Isn't something I was Told!--

650,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"It's like when both your hands are cold,"
651,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,And Pockets you can't put them in!
652,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,--Like something happened long ago;
653,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"--Like feeling Homesick,--yes, and Shy;"
654,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Like being Sorry,--when you know"

665,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,I never dared to look away
666,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"While they were tuning so,"
667,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"For fear the Curtain might go up,"
668,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,--And I not see it go!--
669,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Then all at once, it all went Dark;--"
670,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"To make you hold your breath and hark,"
671,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"--Oh, hold your breath and hark!"

673,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Excepting where the Curtain was,"
674,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,It stayed as black as night;
675,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And that kept still one minute more,"
676,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,All edged across with light:--
677,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Then Up--and Up--
678,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And Oh, so soon,"
679,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"It was like all Inside the Moon,"
680,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"--Yes, sitting in the Moon!"
681,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,
682,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And Oh, how Beautiful they were!--"
683,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,And could we see them near?--
684,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And Oh, how brave at everything!"
685,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,But it was somehow queer
686,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,
687,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,To see that smiling way they had:
688,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"They smiled so much, but not all glad;"
689,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"--No, not so always glad."
690,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,
691,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,I wish we couldn't go away;
692,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,I wish it would begin
693,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"All over, now, and never end;"
694,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,I wish we were Locked In!
695,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Oh, can't we see it all again?"
696,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,To-morrow!--Sunday! Monday? When?

709,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Till the Houses seemed to watch People going by;
710,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And they kept me looking, too,--wondering where and why."

742,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,And let me take it to begin.
743,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,I made it. But I did not know
744,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,How very long it takes to sew.
745,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,I took a long time for that stitch;

747,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Is better. But not one is small,"
748,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,And they are not alike at all.
749,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,That side was very hard to fix.
750,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And then, the needle always pricks:"
751,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"But you must hold it, and take care,--"
752,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Because the point is always there;
753,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,And knots keep coming by and by;
754,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And then, no matter how you try,"

794,II,"With curly coats, like wool;"
795,II,And floppy ears to pull;
796,II,"Yes, and a wide pink mouth, with such a Smile!"
797,II,"Yes, and a Tail that beats time all the while;"
798,II,"Beautiful, Beautiful!--"
799,II,"And golden stars, for eyes,"
800,II,Behind the darkest trees
801,II,(Till your hair's parted)!

806,II,As You?--
807,II,"My Wonderful (even if you Won't say _Mew_),"
808,II,My True Prince in Disguise!
809,II,Why can't they be
810,II,"As funny, when they try to sing a song?"
811,II,"And when, for everything that I can do,"
812,II,"They Won't Agree,--"

887,IV,I knew long ago.--
888,IV,"And the more I never tell you it,"
889,IV,The more it gets to be.
890,IV,
891,IV,It makes me feel as purry
892,IV,As the Kitten on your knee.
893,IV,It makes me feel as round and warm
894,IV,As the Sparrow on that tree;
895,IV,It makes me puff my feathers out

918,IV,I promised not to look
919,IV,"(The way I did before),"
920,IV,But I can hear you purring--
921,IV,"Purring, through the door:"
922,IV,"A green, soft, purring;"
923,IV,Just as if you knew:
924,IV,_Everybody here

963,IV,Beautiful to see.

1093,IV,They want you to believe

1122,IV,
1123,IV,"He might have been an Angel, too!"
