70,_PREFACE_,_PREFACE_
71,_PREFACE_,
72,_PREFACE_,Oh that my words were now written!
73,_PREFACE_,"Oh that they were inscribed in a book!--JOB xix, 23."
74,_PREFACE_,
75,_PREFACE_,
76,_PREFACE_,"Books have, from time immemorial, been the conservators of human"
77,_PREFACE_,"wisdom, the repositories of information, the mentors of youth and"
78,_PREFACE_,"adolescence, the counsellors of manhood, the comfort and companionship"
79,_PREFACE_,of age.
80,_PREFACE_,
81,_PREFACE_,"The experience of an individual, school or era, when committed to book"
82,_PREFACE_,"form, becomes the common property of all succeeding time, and the"
83,_PREFACE_,"accumulated knowledge of the past, transmitted from generation to"
84,_PREFACE_,"generation, through the medium of books, may with justice be regarded"
85,_PREFACE_,as the most valuable of human heritages.
86,_PREFACE_,
87,_PREFACE_,But they have not always been unmixed blessings; they have both led
88,_PREFACE_,"and misled; they have elucidated, yet have mystified."
89,_PREFACE_,
90,_PREFACE_,"They have dissipated the shadows of ignorance and superstition, but in"
91,_PREFACE_,some instances have confused and obscured the searchlight of truth. In
92,_PREFACE_,"the economy of human affairs, books have been factors of no small"
93,_PREFACE_,importance. They have proved the most potent expositors of iniquitous
94,_PREFACE_,"systems, and when properly directed against crying evils have"
95,_PREFACE_,"accomplished speedy reforms. They have precipitated wars, incited"
96,_PREFACE_,"revolts and seditions in the cause of progress, yet have intensified"
97,_PREFACE_,"prejudice, political, religious and racial. With silent eloquence,"
98,_PREFACE_,they have cried out against the wrongs of those who had none to plead
99,_PREFACE_,"their cause, while in other cases, their influence has tended to"
100,_PREFACE_,perpetuate existing abuses. In some instances they have taught men to
101,_PREFACE_,"be content with servitude, in others have ignited the beacon fires of"
102,_PREFACE_,liberty. Though they are usually found enlisted under the banners of
103,_PREFACE_,"justice, yet no cause has ever been so unworthy, and no institution so"
104,_PREFACE_,"unholy, that books have not been written in their defence. In verity,"
105,_PREFACE_,they have sown both wheat and tares.
106,_PREFACE_,
107,_PREFACE_,"Books have been written on every conceivable subject, under all"
108,_PREFACE_,"conditions, by all sorts of writers, and from an endless variety of"
109,_PREFACE_,motives. The recompense of those who have written them has been
110,_PREFACE_,"equally various. Some have been apotheosized and worshipped, others"
111,_PREFACE_,have been the recipients of orders and decorations of honor at the
112,_PREFACE_,"hands of kings and potentates, while others have received the ovations"
113,_PREFACE_,of admiring multitudes. Some have anonymously contributed their mite
114,_PREFACE_,"toward the enrichment of literature, others have appeared, from whence"
115,_PREFACE_,"we know not, and after placing their offerings upon the altars of"
116,_PREFACE_,"poesy and art have departed unrewarded into the shadows of obscurity,"
117,_PREFACE_,leaving as footprints innumerable quotations which have become
118,_PREFACE_,"proverbial. Some, as the bards and minnesingers of old who in"
119,_PREFACE_,medi√¶val castles ate their bread by the sufferance of the feudal lords
120,_PREFACE_,"and barons, have in more recent years been dependent upon the bounty"
121,_PREFACE_,"of some munificent, and usually titled patron, to whom they, as a"
122,_PREFACE_,"matter of policy, dedicated their strains and panegyrics, consequently"
123,_PREFACE_,wielding mercenary pens. Some who have presumed to write in a manner
124,_PREFACE_,displeasing to those who sat in high places have met with
125,_PREFACE_,"vilification, exile, imprisonment, decapitation, and have not been"
126,_PREFACE_,strangers to the pillory. Criticism and ridicule are the patent
127,_PREFACE_,"rewards of incipient authorship, while want, neglect and starvation"
128,_PREFACE_,have terminated the career of more than one name afterwards great in
129,_PREFACE_,the world of letters.
130,_PREFACE_,
131,_PREFACE_,Aside from motives common to all who with reverent steps humbly strive
132,_PREFACE_,"to follow where the great lights of poesy have led, the author of"
133,_PREFACE_,"these unpretentious pages has been actuated by a desire to portray, in"
134,_PREFACE_,"his correct light, a very frequently misrepresented character, viz.:"
135,_PREFACE_,the pioneer prospector. It has long been customary for writers of
136,_PREFACE_,western fiction to picture this character as a large-hearted but rough
137,_PREFACE_,"and untutored individual, expressing himself in a vernacular"
138,_PREFACE_,"consisting of equal parts of slang, profanity and questionable"
139,_PREFACE_,"grammar, possessing no ambitions above the card table or the strong"
140,_PREFACE_,waters which cause all men to err who drink them. An intimate
141,_PREFACE_,"acquaintance with this class, extending from the years of infancy to"
142,_PREFACE_,"middle age, convinces the writer that the common description is"
143,_PREFACE_,manifestly unjust and misleading.
144,_PREFACE_,
145,_PREFACE_,"The men who flocked to the early gold excitements, and who"
146,_PREFACE_,subsequently prospected the western mountain ranges for their hidden
147,_PREFACE_,"wealth, were the cream of American and European manhood; men possessed"
148,_PREFACE_,"of more than ordinary endowments of intellect, education and physique,"
149,_PREFACE_,"while their industry, bravery and hardihood have never been"
150,_PREFACE_,questioned.
151,_PREFACE_,
152,_PREFACE_,Proof of this exists in the names which have lingered behind them as a
153,_PREFACE_,"matter of record, for it was the prospector who christened the"
154,_PREFACE_,"mountains, gulches and mining locations of the west. A cursory perusal"
155,_PREFACE_,"of the maps of mineral surveys in any western mining district, will"
156,_PREFACE_,"reveal in abundance such names as Hector, Ajax, Golden Fleece, Atlas,"
157,_PREFACE_,"Pegasus, etc.; indicating that those who applied them were, if not"
158,_PREFACE_,"college graduates, men not unfamiliar with the classics. The use of"
159,_PREFACE_,"such names as Cleopatra, Crusader or Magna Charta, by a prospector"
160,_PREFACE_,"unversed in history, would naturally be unexpected. One without"
161,_PREFACE_,knowledge of literature would hardly grace his location stakes with
162,_PREFACE_,"such names as Dante, Hamlet or Mephistopheles, while one entirely"
163,_PREFACE_,"unlettered could not by chance hit upon such names as Pandora, Medusa"
164,_PREFACE_,or Sesostris.
165,_PREFACE_,
166,_PREFACE_,"Of the pioneer prospectors but few remain; many have fallen asleep,"
167,_PREFACE_,others tiring of the privation and uncertainty incident to a miner's
168,_PREFACE_,"life, are pursuing other vocations, while many have become prosperous"
169,_PREFACE_,ranch and cattle-men and may now be found in almost any western
170,_PREFACE_,"valley. A few, a very few in comparison with the less fortunate"
171,_PREFACE_,"majority, acquiring a competence, removed to other localities, and in"
172,_PREFACE_,"not a few instances, have become conspicuous figures in the world of"
173,_PREFACE_,"business, politics and finance."
174,_PREFACE_,
175,_PREFACE_,"In the mountainous districts of the west, you may still occasionally"
176,_PREFACE_,"see a veteran prospector of the old school, living the life of a"
177,_PREFACE_,"hermit in his log cabin, situated in some picturesque park or gulch,"
178,_PREFACE_,"near his, sometimes valuable but more frequently worthless, mining"
179,_PREFACE_,"locations. There he lives winter and summer, his only companion a cat"
180,_PREFACE_,"or dog; the ambitions of his youth still unrealized, but at three"
181,_PREFACE_,"score and ten, hopeful and expectant. His bent form, white hair, and"
182,_PREFACE_,"venerable bearing impress you strangely at first, but it is only when"
183,_PREFACE_,you overcome the reticence peculiar to those who have long dwelt in
184,_PREFACE_,"solitude, and engage him in conversation, that his mental status"
185,_PREFACE_,becomes apparent. To your surprise you discover that he can converse
186,_PREFACE_,"entertainingly on any subject, from the Mosaic dispensation, to the"
187,_PREFACE_,"latest inventions in the world of mechanism. You may find him to be,"
188,_PREFACE_,"not only a Shakspearean scholar, but a deep student of that volume"
189,_PREFACE_,"which, whether considered from a sacred or secular point of view,"
190,_PREFACE_,stands preeminently forth as the Book of Books. You may find him able
191,_PREFACE_,"to translate Homer, or Virgil, and that the masterpieces of literature"
192,_PREFACE_,are as familiar to him as his own cabin walls. A glimpse at the
193,_PREFACE_,interior of his cabin discloses an ample stock of newspapers and
194,_PREFACE_,"magazines, while books are not strangers. There is something pathetic"
195,_PREFACE_,about his loneliness; you leave him with the feeling that society has
196,_PREFACE_,"been the loser by his voluntary banishment, and are reminded of Gray's"
197,_PREFACE_,immortal lines:
198,_PREFACE_,
199,_PREFACE_,"""Full many a gem of purest ray serene."
200,_PREFACE_,The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear;
201,_PREFACE_,"Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,"
202,_PREFACE_,"And waste its sweetness on the desert air."""
203,_PREFACE_,
204,_PREFACE_,"You speculate upon the story of his life, for you feel that it has a"
205,_PREFACE_,"secret, if not a tragedy, connected with it, into which you may not"
206,_PREFACE_,"probe. You ask yourself the question, ""Has not his life been wasted?"""
207,_PREFACE_,"and if he alone is to be considered, there is none but an affirmative"
208,_PREFACE_,answer. But his life has not been barren of results. He has been a
209,_PREFACE_,"contributory factor in the upbuilding of an empire, for he is one of"
210,_PREFACE_,the class who laid the foundations of western prosperity.
211,_PREFACE_,
212,_PREFACE_,"These men came west for various reasons, some actuated by the spirit"
213,_PREFACE_,"of adventure, some to acquire fortunes or to retrieve vanished ones,"
214,_PREFACE_,others possibly to outlive the stigma of youthful mistakes. In the
215,_PREFACE_,lives of many of them are sealed chapters. It is with such that these
216,_PREFACE_,pages have to do.

412,I. THE STORM,"Of brother peaks, on left and right,"

414,I. THE STORM,The giant of the rocky waste
415,I. THE STORM,"With awe-inspiring aspect stood,"
416,I. THE STORM,"The sentry of the solitude,"
417,I. THE STORM,Guarding the mountainous expanse
418,I. THE STORM,With his imposing battlements.
419,I. THE STORM,"In rock-ribbed armor panoplied,"
420,I. THE STORM,"With rugged walls on every side,"
421,I. THE STORM,"Beseamed with countless scars and rents,"
422,I. THE STORM,"From combat with the elements,"
423,I. THE STORM,"He towered with mute and massive form,"
424,I. THE STORM,A challenge to the gathering storm.
425,I. THE STORM,
426,I. THE STORM,This overshadowing mountain peak
427,I. THE STORM,In solemn silence seemed to speak
428,I. THE STORM,A prophecy of arctic doom;
429,I. THE STORM,"As in his frigid splendor dressed,"
430,I. THE STORM,"He reared aloft his frozen crest,"
431,I. THE STORM,Surmounted by a snowy plume.
432,I. THE STORM,His wrinkled and forbidding brow
433,I. THE STORM,A sombre shadow seemed to throw
434,I. THE STORM,"O'er other crags as wild and stern,"
435,I. THE STORM,Which frowned defiance in return.
436,I. THE STORM,
437,I. THE STORM,"The wind, lugubrious and sad,"
438,I. THE STORM,"In doleful accents, soft and low,"
439,I. THE STORM,"Mourned through the dismal forests, clad"
440,I. THE STORM,"In weird habiliments of snow,"

444,I. THE STORM,The spectres of departed woods.
445,I. THE STORM,And with uninterrupted flow
446,I. THE STORM,"The streamlet, underneath the snow,"
447,I. THE STORM,Answered the wind's despondent moan
448,I. THE STORM,With plaint of gurgling monotone;
449,I. THE STORM,"Or, locked in winter's stern embrace,"
450,I. THE STORM,"No longer trickled in its bed,"
451,I. THE STORM,But found a frigid resting place
452,I. THE STORM,"In stationary ice, instead."
453,I. THE STORM,"The crystal snowflakes gently fell,"
454,I. THE STORM,"Enrobing mountain, plain and dell,"
455,I. THE STORM,"In mantle spotless and complete,"
456,I. THE STORM,As nature in her winding sheet.
457,I. THE STORM,Layer upon layer fell fast and deep
458,I. THE STORM,"Till every cliff, abrupt and steep,"
459,I. THE STORM,Was crowned with coronal of white.
460,I. THE STORM,"Capricious gusts, which whirl and sift,"
461,I. THE STORM,"Built comb and overhanging drift,"
462,I. THE STORM,From feathery flakes so soft and light.
463,I. THE STORM,
464,I. THE STORM,More thickly flew the snow and fast;
465,I. THE STORM,The wind developed and the blast
466,I. THE STORM,"Soon churned the tempest, till the air"
467,I. THE STORM,"Seemed but a white and whirling glare,"
468,I. THE STORM,Through which the penetrating eye
469,I. THE STORM,No shape nor contour might descry.
470,I. THE STORM,
471,I. THE STORM,"The poor belated traveller,"
472,I. THE STORM,"Who braved the rigor of that day,"
473,I. THE STORM,"Might thank his bright protecting star,--"
474,I. THE STORM,"If orbs of pure celestial ray,"
475,I. THE STORM,"Far in the scintillating skies,"
476,I. THE STORM,"Preside o'er human destinies,--"
477,I. THE STORM,"That he, bewildered and distressed,"
478,I. THE STORM,"Had warded off exhaustion's rest,"
479,I. THE STORM,And in that maze of pine and fir
480,I. THE STORM,Escaped an icy sepulchre.
481,I. THE STORM,
482,I. THE STORM,"When driving snows accumulate,"
483,I. THE STORM,They yield to the tremendous weight.
484,I. THE STORM,And down the mountain's rugged sides
485,I. THE STORM,"The mass with great momentum slides,"
486,I. THE STORM,"Cleaving the fragile spruce and pine,"
487,I. THE STORM,"Which stand in its ill-fated line,"
488,I. THE STORM,"As bearded grain, mature and lithe,"
489,I. THE STORM,Goes down before the reaper's scythe.
490,I. THE STORM,"Or, when the cyclone's baleful force,"
491,I. THE STORM,"In flood of atmospheric wrath,"
492,I. THE STORM,"Pursues its devastating course,"
493,I. THE STORM,Leaving but ruin in its path;
494,I. THE STORM,Despoiling in a moment's span
495,I. THE STORM,The most exalted works of man;
496,I. THE STORM,"Or waters, suddenly set free,"
497,I. THE STORM,"When some black thunder cloud is rent,"
498,I. THE STORM,Rush down a wild declivity
499,I. THE STORM,"With irresistible descent,"
500,I. THE STORM,Depositing on every hand
501,I. THE STORM,A layer of sediment and sand;
502,I. THE STORM,"With swift and spoliating flow,"
503,I. THE STORM,"Uprooting many a noble tree,"
504,I. THE STORM,To strew the desert wastes below
505,I. THE STORM,With scattered drift-wood and debris;
506,I. THE STORM,"Such is the dreadful avalanche,"
507,I. THE STORM,"Which rends the forest, root and branch."
508,I. THE STORM,
509,I. THE STORM,"From dangers in such varied form,"
510,I. THE STORM,"And the discomforts of the storm,"
511,I. THE STORM,Small wonder 'twas the mountaineer
512,I. THE STORM,Left not his fireside's ruddy cheer;
513,I. THE STORM,But from behind the bolted door
514,I. THE STORM,"Discerned the tempest's strident roar,"
515,I. THE STORM,"Or heard the pendent icicle,"
516,I. THE STORM,"Which, from the eaves, in fragments fell,"
517,I. THE STORM,As some more formidable blast
518,I. THE STORM,In paroxysmal fury passed.
519,I. THE STORM,"It shook with intermittent throes,"
520,I. THE STORM,"Of boisterous, spasmodic power,"
521,I. THE STORM,"A most substantial hut, which rose,"
522,I. THE STORM,As summer breeze sways grass or flower
523,I. THE STORM,And e'en the dull immobile ground
524,I. THE STORM,Trembled in sympathy profound.
525,I. THE STORM,
526,I. THE STORM,"Such was the fury of the storm,"
527,I. THE STORM,As if the crystal flakes had met
528,I. THE STORM,"With militating hosts, to swarm"
529,I. THE STORM,In siege about its parapet.
530,I. THE STORM,
531,I. THE STORM,"When every rampant onslaught failed,"
532,I. THE STORM,The blast in wanton frenzy wailed.
533,I. THE STORM,As if with unspent rage the wind
534,I. THE STORM,"Felt much disgruntled and chagrined,"
535,I. THE STORM,"And though of nugatory force,"
536,I. THE STORM,Could vent its spleen with accents hoarse.
537,I. THE STORM,As some beleaguered tower of old
538,I. THE STORM,"Besieged by warriors stern and bold,"
539,I. THE STORM,"Who dashed against its walls of stone,"
540,I. THE STORM,Which were not swayed nor overthrown;
541,I. THE STORM,"As vicious strokes delivered well,"
542,I. THE STORM,Innocuous and futile fell.
543,I. THE STORM,"Then watched the walls withstand the strain,"
544,I. THE STORM,And cursed and gnashed their teeth in vain.
545,I. THE STORM,
546,I. THE STORM,"Beneath a massive pinnacle,"
547,I. THE STORM,"Whose weird, forbidding shadows fell,"
548,I. THE STORM,And gulch and forest overcast
549,I. THE STORM,"With mantle ominous and vast,"
550,I. THE STORM,"Nestling amid the spruce and pine,"
551,I. THE STORM,"Which fringe the edge of timberline,"
552,I. THE STORM,"This miner's cabin, quaint and rude,"
553,I. THE STORM,"From the surrounding forest hewed,"
554,I. THE STORM,"With primitive, yet stable form,"
555,I. THE STORM,"Withstood the onslaught of the storm,"
556,I. THE STORM,And at the entrance of a dell
557,I. THE STORM,Stood as a rustic sentinel.
558,I. THE STORM,
559,I. THE STORM,"Beneath a pine's protecting skirt,"
560,I. THE STORM,"It reared its modest roof of poles,"
561,I. THE STORM,"Laid close, then overlaid with dirt,"
562,I. THE STORM,To cover up the cracks and holes;
563,I. THE STORM,The intervals between the logs
564,I. THE STORM,Were daubed with mud from mountain bogs.
565,I. THE STORM,The ground did service as a floor
566,I. THE STORM,"In this, as many huts before;"
567,I. THE STORM,"So beaten down beneath the tread,"
568,I. THE STORM,It more resembled tile instead.
569,I. THE STORM,
570,I. THE STORM,"The plastic clay, compressed and sleek,"
571,I. THE STORM,Was level and as hard as brick.
572,I. THE STORM,"Protruding boulders, smooth and bare,"
573,I. THE STORM,Exposed their faces here and there;
574,I. THE STORM,"And with their surfaces displayed,"
575,I. THE STORM,A primitive mosaic made.
576,I. THE STORM,"And, terminating in a stack,"
577,I. THE STORM,"Some feet above the cabin's roof,"
578,I. THE STORM,"The fireplace, comfortless and black,"
579,I. THE STORM,Arose the dingy form uncouth.
580,I. THE STORM,"This object of depressing gloom,"
581,I. THE STORM,"Built in the corner of the room,"
582,I. THE STORM,"When filled with lurid tongues of flame,"
583,I. THE STORM,A cheerful cynosure became.
584,I. THE STORM,
585,I. THE STORM,The furnishings within were crude;
586,I. THE STORM,A table fastened to the wall
587,I. THE STORM,Had been with some exertion hewed
588,I. THE STORM,"From aspen timbers straight and tall,"
589,I. THE STORM,"And was, in lieu of table legs,"
590,I. THE STORM,Supported by protruding pegs.
591,I. THE STORM,"A cracker box, with shelves inside,"
592,I. THE STORM,"The leading corner occupied,"
593,I. THE STORM,"And made an ample cupboard there,"
594,I. THE STORM,Where tin supplanted chinaware.
595,I. THE STORM,"A frying pan, which from a nail"
596,I. THE STORM,"Suspended, dripped a greasy trail."
597,I. THE STORM,"Framed from the hemlock's poles and boughs,"
598,I. THE STORM,The rustic bunks within the house
599,I. THE STORM,Were not elaborate affairs;
600,I. THE STORM,While boxes filled the place of chairs.
601,I. THE STORM,
602,I. THE STORM,Tacked on the unpretentious wall
603,I. THE STORM,"Were advertisements, great and small,"
604,I. THE STORM,"While lithograph and crayon scenes,"
605,I. THE STORM,"Clipped from the standard magazines,"
606,I. THE STORM,"Comprised a mimic gallery,"
607,I. THE STORM,Which broke the wall's monotony.
608,I. THE STORM,"No carpets were upon that floor,"
609,I. THE STORM,But at the bottom of the door
610,I. THE STORM,"The rug, against its yawning crack,"
611,I. THE STORM,Consisted of a gunny-sack.
612,I. THE STORM,"Nor was there lock upon that door,"
613,I. THE STORM,The guardian of sordid pelf;
614,I. THE STORM,"The traveller, distressed and sore,"
615,I. THE STORM,Might enter there and help himself.
616,I. THE STORM,
617,I. THE STORM,Within this weather-beaten hut
618,I. THE STORM,"Of logs, by many a tempest tried,"
619,I. THE STORM,"With doors and windows closely shut,"
620,I. THE STORM,To keep the genial warmth inside;
621,I. THE STORM,"A group of hardy mountaineers,"
622,I. THE STORM,"Blockaded by the winter's snow,"
623,I. THE STORM,Sat by the fireside's ruddy glow.
624,I. THE STORM,"Some old, and old beyond their years,"
625,I. THE STORM,"As disappointments, toil and strife,"
626,I. THE STORM,"Which constitute the miner's life,"
627,I. THE STORM,"Must operate with process sure,"

1230,III. THE PRISONER,As ever and anon a dying squeak
1231,III. THE PRISONER,Told of the strong prevailing o'er the weak;

1271,III. THE PRISONER,Within its gracious scope included me.
1272,III. THE PRISONER,"Released at last by ukase absolute,"
1273,III. THE PRISONER,"But famished, homeless, sick and destitute."

2153,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"To slay them with the bayonet and ball,"
2154,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Or by, perhaps, your brother's hand to fall.'"
2155,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2156,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,I heard the clarion accents of the fife
2157,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Fan into flames the dormant coals of strife.
2158,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"With blast prophetic and reverberant swell,"
2159,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,I heard the bugle's echoing voice foretell
2160,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The coming conflict, while the brazen notes"
2161,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Were answered by the cheers from many throats.
2162,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I heard the measured rattle of the drum,"
2163,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Proclaiming that the day of wrath had come.
2164,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I heard harangues, incendiary and loud,"
2165,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Meet with the approbation of the crowd.
2166,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I saw the faltering and irresolute,"
2167,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Greeted with jeer and deprecating hoot.
2168,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I saw the threatening clouds of war increase,"
2169,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Yet prayed for peace, where there could be no peace."
2170,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The winds of slavery their seed had sown;
2171,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,That seed to rank maturity had grown;
2172,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The cup was full, and now from branch and root,"
2173,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The whirlwind came to strip its lawful fruit.
2174,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2175,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,I saw my friends and neighbors march away
2176,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"With martial tread, in uniforms of gray."
2177,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,I saw them raise their caps in passing by
2178,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,And fair hands wave their kerchiefs in reply.
2179,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Then I, who had in military schools"
2180,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Received some insight into army rules,"
2181,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And, being of a martial turn of mind,"
2182,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Was offered a commission, and,--declined."
2183,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"My declination was a shock to all,"
2184,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"'Coward!' said they, 'to shun your country's call,--"
2185,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Then stay at home, from wounds and scars exempt,"
2186,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"But pay the price,--your former friends' contempt.'"
2187,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2188,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"That action was, for me, the Rubicon,"
2189,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Which crossed, I had no choice but follow on."
2190,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"But what a change! The penalty was high,"
2191,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,My childhood's friends now passed me coldly by.
2192,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I, who had been a social favorite,"
2193,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Received no salutation when we met.
2194,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Fair ones, who used to smile, now looked askance,"
2195,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Or eyed me with a cold indifference.
2196,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"My action seemed base cowardice in their eyes,"
2197,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,They knowing not my secret sympathies.
2198,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Though of a family rich and widely known,"
2199,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I stood in the community, alone,"
2200,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Like a pariah none would recognize,"
2201,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Inaction was enough to ostracize.
2202,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I seemed to see, like Hagar's fated son,"
2203,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Against me raised the hand of every one.
2204,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2205,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The time had come when I must make my choice,"
2206,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Defend one side with musket and with voice;
2207,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Then I, to conscience and convictions true,"
2208,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Seemed an apostate,--for I chose the blue."
2209,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2210,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,There are inscriptions on the scrolls of fate
2211,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Which seem too bitter even to relate.
2212,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I waive the details,--better to conceal"
2213,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The secret skeletons, than to reveal."
2214,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I shall not tell you how my brother stormed,"
2215,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,When he of my intentions was informed.
2216,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I pass the story, how my ringing ears"
2217,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Were filled with threats, entreaties and with sneers."
2218,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And how with tear-stained face the maiden came,"
2219,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Who was to be my bride and bear my name;
2220,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"How she appealed to sentiment and pride,"
2221,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Plead, supplicated,--then forsook my side;"
2222,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And how one evening, in an angry burst,"
2223,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,My sire pronounced his favorite son accurst;
2224,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And how a mother, clinging to her child,"
2225,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Saw son and father still unreconciled;
2226,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And how that father, pointing to the door,"
2227,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Forbade that son to cross the threshold more;
2228,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"'Go, go!' said he, 'but never more return!"
2229,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Go, slay your neighbors, pillage, sack and burn!"
2230,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"But never while the golden sun doth shine,"
2231,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Be welcomed home as son and heir of mine.'
2232,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I state not what in anger I replied,"
2233,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,For anger in my breast has long since died.
2234,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Renounced, despised and disinherited,"
2235,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I trod the path of duty where it led,"
2236,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And ten days later, in the rain and damp,"
2237,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Stood as a sentry near a Union camp.
2238,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,

2240,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2241,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Fain from my recollections would I blot
2242,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"These images, which time erases not,"
2243,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And leave to history's undying page,"
2244,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The recitation of those acts of rage.
2245,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Incarnadined with human blood appears
2246,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The record of the four succeeding years.
2247,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Black with the ruins of the vandal flame,"
2248,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,A carnival of misery and shame.
2249,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I must abridge, and if my hearers please,"
2250,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Confine myself to generalities.
2251,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2252,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"From first Manassas to the Wilderness,"
2253,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"A period of some four years,--more or less,"
2254,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"But anyway, till long in sixty-four,"
2255,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,A musket or a shoulder-strap I bore.
2256,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Though years have passed, I have remembrance yet"
2257,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Of musketry and glistening bayonet.
2258,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,As retrospective moods attune the ear
2259,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"To memory's voice, again I seem to hear"
2260,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The cannon's deep and minatory roar,"
2261,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Like breakers dashing on a rock-bound shore.
2262,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The bursting bomb and fulminating shell,"
2263,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Again their stories of destruction tell.
2264,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2265,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Again to-night, with memory's eye I view"
2266,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The sanguinary scenes of sixty-two,"
2267,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The march of infantry, the reckless dash"
2268,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Of cavalry, with onslaught fierce and rash;"
2269,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I see their sabres, glittering and bare,"
2270,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Flash from their scabbards in the smoky air;
2271,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I hear the clatter of the horses' hoofs,"
2272,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,And see the smoke expand in greyish puffs;
2273,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"As rifles flash and speed the deadly ball,"
2274,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,I see the riders from their horses fall;
2275,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Yet forward moves the furious attack,"
2276,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The opposing column wavers and falls back;
2277,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I see the impact, combat hand to hand,"
2278,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Horses and riders writhing on the sand;
2279,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I see the steeds with perspiration wet,"
2280,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Sink on the well-directed bayonet;
2281,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I see them, wounded by the fatal lunge,"
2282,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Become unmanageable and madly plunge;
2283,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Foaming and snorting with the sudden pain,"
2284,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,They trample on the wounded and the slain;
2285,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,I see their riders in the stirrups stand
2286,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,And grasp their pistols with the bridle hand;
2287,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I see the pistols flash and sabres thrust,"
2288,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"A scene of wild confusion, smoke and dust;"
2289,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I hear the bugle sounding a retreat,"
2290,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"They now retire, their victory complete;"
2291,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,But mark the price paid for their brief success;
2292,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Horses with blood-stained saddles,--riderless."
2293,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2294,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I see an army bivouac on the field,"
2295,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"To nature's obdurate demands they yield,"
2296,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And on the ground, from sheer exhaustion spent,"
2297,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,They lie without protecting roof or tent.
2298,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"So silently their prostrate forms are spread,"
2299,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,One may not tell the sleeping from the dead.
2300,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I see, before the campfire's fitful gleam,"
2301,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The sentry pace, as in a waking dream,"
2302,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Yet manfully subduing the fatigue
2303,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Of battle, and the march of many a league,"
2304,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,For no excitement or emotion serves
2305,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,To buoy his spirits or sustain his nerves.
2306,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Weak from the loss of their accustomed rest,"
2307,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"With heavy eyes and aching bones distressed,"
2308,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The while their weary comrades soundly sleep,"
2309,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The sentinels their lonely vigils keep,"
2310,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"As from the glittering expanse of skies,"
2311,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The stars look down with cold, impassive eyes."
2312,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2313,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I see brigades, magnificent and large,"
2314,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,With bristling bayonets prepare to charge;
2315,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I see their banners in the distance gleam,"
2316,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Reflecting back the sun's resplendent beam;
2317,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Within the shelter of the rifle pits,"
2318,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Another army with composure sits,"
2319,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,While ever and anon a rifle's crack
2320,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Seems to invite the spirited attack.
2321,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"From a commanding, wooded eminence,"
2322,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"By nature calculated for defence,"
2323,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Upon the advancing regiments I see
2324,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The murderous belching of artillery;
2325,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I see their proud and militant array,"
2326,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Before the deadly grapeshot melt away;
2327,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Before the rifle's supplementing breath,"
2328,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Whole columns sink in ghastly heaps of death;
2329,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I see them close their gaps and press ahead,"
2330,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,But only to augment the list of dead;
2331,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I see them, stretched upon the burning sands,"
2332,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Clutching the air with lacerated hands;
2333,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"From underneath the mutilated heap,"
2334,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The wounded, with great difficulty, creep;"
2335,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Dragging a helpless arm, or shattered limb,"
2336,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"With reeling brain and sight confused and dim,"
2337,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"They grope, they crawl, or limp with painful tread;"
2338,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Their uniforms no longer blue, but red;"
2339,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And pinioned underneath the ghastly pile,"
2340,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,I hear them struggle for release the while;
2341,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"But fainter, ever fainter grow their cries,"
2342,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Fainter, and fainter still, their groans arise;"
2343,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Weaker and weaker are their throes, until"
2344,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"With one last quivering throb, they too, are still."
2345,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2346,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I see the vultures, as they scent afar"
2347,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Their portion in the reeking spoils of war;
2348,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Far in the distance scattering specks appear,"
2349,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Which multiply in size as they draw near,"
2350,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Until they balance with their pinions spread,"
2351,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Or circle 'round the dying and the dead.
2352,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2353,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"This is the realistic side of war,"
2354,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Which most men overlook and all abhor,"
2355,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Which differs from the sentiments conveyed
2356,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,By spotless uniforms on dress parade.

2364,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Though opposite to every humane thought,"
2365,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"With murder, pillage and destruction fraught,"
2366,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"In literature, in history and art,"

2368,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Though at the best, deplorable and bad,"
2369,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,'Tis yet with sentiment and romance clad;
2370,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Thus are the gory deeds of sword and fire,"
2371,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Commemorated by the bardic lyre.

2377,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"'Tis said that heroes are the fruits of war,"
2378,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"No matter what the struggle may be for,"
2379,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"As men will fight to make, or unmake laws,"
2380,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Will fight for, or against the worthiest cause."
2381,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"They must have heroes, though to make them drains"
2382,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The life-blood from the nation's noblest veins.
2383,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And though no vocal adulations rise,"
2384,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Their heroes many men apotheosize.
2385,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Man is so strangely constituted, he"

2387,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"So give him heroes, let the armies bleed,"
2388,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,And he will worship them with word and deed;

2481,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The weakened corps, including my brigade,"
2482,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"With sadly thinned and decimated ranks,"
2483,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Was hurled once more against the rebel flanks.
2484,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"There in a hurricane of shot and shell,"
2485,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,One-half of its surviving numbers fell;
2486,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,'Twas thus Cold Harbor's quarry made complete
2487,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The trio of victorious defeat.
2488,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2489,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Three Southern victories, yet like a knell"
2490,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Upon the Southern ear these triumphs fell;
2491,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"For those who perished in that dismal waste,"
2492,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Had fallen and could never be replaced.
2493,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Though stubbornly contested inch by inch,"
2494,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The lines were tightened like a horse's cinch.
2495,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"We watched the Southern forces day by day,"
2496,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"From natural abrasion, wear away."

2502,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"With much diminished numbers, my brigade"
2503,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Its camp beside the Rappahannock made,"
2504,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Some five miles distant from the spot of earth
2505,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Associated with my humble birth.
2506,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2507,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Next morning, ere the twinkling stars had set,"
2508,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"While officers and men were sleeping yet,"
2509,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"A courier rode up to my command,"
2510,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,And placed a cipher message in my hand;
2511,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Then spurring well his horse of dapple grey,"
2512,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,With parting salutation rode away.
2513,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,This was the import of that message stern:
2514,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,'Lay waste the district. All the fences burn.
2515,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Leave not a house or stable unconsumed.'
2516,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,My father's house among the rest was--doomed.
2517,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I read that message and my anger blazed,"
2518,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"My home to be, by my own orders, razed!"
2519,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2520,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"A vision rose before my swimming brain,"
2521,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I saw the old parental roof again,"
2522,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I saw my father, as in days of yore,"
2523,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Smoking his pipe beside the open door;
2524,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I saw his gaze, with penetrating look,"
2525,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Fixed on the pages of some wholesome book;
2526,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I saw my mother sit beside him, there,"
2527,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Recumbent in her old reclining chair.
2528,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The vision changed,--I saw her parting tears,"
2529,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,My father's parting curse rang in my ears;
2530,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"'Go! Go!' said he, 'but nevermore return,"
2531,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Go, slay your neighbors, pillage, sack and burn,"
2532,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,But never while the golden sun doth shine
2533,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Be welcomed home as son and heir of mine.'
2534,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2535,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I felt but little longing to return,"
2536,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And less desire to pillage, sack and burn."
2537,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And yet,--those cruel orders I must give,"
2538,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,No power had I to voice the negative.
2539,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"In commonplace affairs of life, 'tis true,"
2540,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Men may elect to do, or not to do."
2541,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"In military operations, they"
2542,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Have no alternative, but to obey."
2543,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2544,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Ah! Fain, from that impending holocaust"
2545,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Would I have snatched them! Rather had I lost
2546,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The tinselled honors and the epaulettes,"
2547,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And doffed my uniform without regrets,"
2548,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Than harm by word or deed that ag√®d sire;
2549,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Yet I must start, who fain would quench the fire."
2550,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I read and read that cipher message there,"
2551,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"How many times, I have not to declare,"
2552,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"But over and again I scanned the lines,"
2553,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,And pondered well its symbols and its signs;
2554,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Ironclad were they, from every standpoint viewed,"
2555,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Admitting not of choice or latitude;
2556,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"So, to the officers of my command,"
2557,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I gave their orders, with a trembling hand,"
2558,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And swift as horseflesh ever travelled, went"
2559,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"To seek the corps commander in his tent,"
2560,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"To crave this boon, or favor, at his hand,--"
2561,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,My father's house be still allowed to stand.
2562,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2563,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,'Twas long before I gained an audience;
2564,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I felt, but cannot picture the suspense"
2565,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Of that long hour's involuntary wait;
2566,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Too late, my heart would beat, too late, too late!"
2567,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,I took a seat and pulled my watch out once;
2568,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"'Too late, too late,' the timepiece ticked response!"
2569,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I paced the ground with quick, impatient tread;"
2570,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"'Too late, too late, too late,' my footsteps said!"
2571,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"'Too late, too late, too late!' With fluttering beat"
2572,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,My heart responded to my echoing feet.
2573,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2574,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The General, who a kindly heart possessed,"
2575,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"No sooner heard, than granted my request;"
2576,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"'Twas but a moment's work to mount my steed,"
2577,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,And spur him to his maximum of speed;
2578,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The faithful creature seemed to understand
2579,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And needed little urging from my hand,"
2580,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"As down the turnpike, toward my childhood's home,"
2581,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"He fairly flew, his bridle white with foam;"
2582,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"His hoofbeats, as we clattered o'er the ground,"
2583,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Returned a dull, premonitory sound,"
2584,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Which seemed to echo and accentuate
2585,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The burden of my heart, 'Too late! Too late!'"
2586,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2587,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The fences, near the turnpike, as we passed,"
2588,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Were by my orders disappearing fast;
2589,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The rails were piled in heaps and soon became
2590,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"A prey to war's red ally,--vandal flame."
2591,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Houses, familiar to my childish sight,"
2592,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Glowed strangely with an unaccustomed light,"
2593,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,While from adjacent barns and hay-ricks broke
2594,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Incipient tongues of flame and clouds of smoke.
2595,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"The orders, ruthless and inflexible,"
2596,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Were by the soldiers executed well.
2597,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2598,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Still down the turnpike dashed my sweating horse,"
2599,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I plied the cruel spurs with double force,"
2600,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,When in the distance there appeared to view
2601,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The old stone manor-house my childhood knew.
2602,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"My spirit sank,--though I was not surprised,"
2603,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"My worst misgivings had been realized,"
2604,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,For from the roof and upper windows came
2605,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Dense clouds of smoke and lurid sheets of flame.
2606,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"It had its portion in the common fate,"
2607,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"'Too late!' the mocking hoof-beats rang, 'Too late!'"
2608,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2609,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"We passed a company, on their return"
2610,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,From executing those instructions stern;
2611,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,It was the company of my brigade
2612,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Wherein I first was a lieutenant made;
2613,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Its officers and men I knew by name;
2614,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,They cheered me when their captain I became;
2615,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"They cheered me when I left a major's tent,"
2616,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,To be the colonel of their regiment.
2617,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2618,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,They did my bidding. How could I condemn!
2619,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,They honored me and I respected them;
2620,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And yet, these favorites of my command"
2621,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Had not one hour before applied the brand
2622,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Which was transforming with its wand of fire
2623,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,My father's house into--his funeral pyre.
2624,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2625,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"That they had met resistance, I could see,"
2626,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"For wounded men, in number two or three,"
2627,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Were by their comrades carted in advance,"
2628,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,While one more limped behind the ambulance.
2629,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Upon a stretcher carried in their van,"
2630,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The soldiers bore the body of a man;
2631,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"He was their captain, and my bosom friend;"
2632,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"He plied that torch,--and met a bloody end."
2633,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2634,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I plunged the spurs, but not without remorse,"
2635,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Into his steaming flanks and urged my horse,"
2636,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Which I disliked to tax beyond his strength;
2637,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Such speed had he maintained, that now, at length,"
2638,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,He was compelled to pant and hesitate;
2639,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"With labored effort we dashed through the gate,"
2640,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Or where the gate had been an hour before,"
2641,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"For gate and fence alike, were seen no more,"
2642,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Save in the scattered bonfires, while at most"
2643,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,All that remained was here and there a post.
2644,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2645,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,There was a fascination in that sight
2646,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Which seemed to conquer and unnerve me, quite;"
2647,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"A sense of horror, not akin to fear,"
2648,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Possessed my being as we galloped near;
2649,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"All sorts of evil pictures filled my mind,"
2650,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"As one who seeks, yet dreads what he may find;"
2651,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"As we drew nearer, I remember well,"
2652,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,With hissing crash the roof collapsed and fell;
2653,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Dismounting, I the premises surveyed,"
2654,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,And viewed the havoc and destruction made;
2655,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Crushed by the disappointment, the suspense,"
2656,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And failure of my planned deliverance,"
2657,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I moved about with apprehensive tread,"
2658,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"To seek my relatives, alive or dead;"
2659,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"And, near a haystack's smouldering ruins found"
2660,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"My father's body, weltering on the ground;"
2661,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"A musket tightly clenched within his hand,"
2662,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Slain by the troopers of my own command;
2663,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"His whitened locks were streaked with crimson stains,"
2664,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The same red blood then coursing through my veins.
2665,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,
2666,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Close by his side, a form with silvered hair,"
2667,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Caressed his brow, with dazed, abstracted air;"
2668,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"'Twas she who nursed my being into life,"
2669,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,The highest type of mother and of wife;
2670,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Our glances met, yet e'er I framed to speak,"
2671,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"She started up, then with a piercing shriek"
2672,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Fell back, expiring on the speechless clay"
2673,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Of him whose life so lately ebbed away.

2684,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"Which seemed a measured requiem for the dead,"
2685,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"As, side by side, in death's eternal sleep,"

2687,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,For feelings which in tears find no relief
2688,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,Had dried the very fountainheads of grief.
2689,VII. THE BLIGHT OF WAR,"I shaped a double mound above their clay,"

3525,DOLORES,"Had never a thought to be sad,"
3526,DOLORES,"But meandered in joy through the meadows,"
3527,DOLORES,With bluebell and columbine clad.
3528,DOLORES,"Her ripples were ripples of laughter,"
3529,DOLORES,"And the soft, dulcet voice of her flow"
3530,DOLORES,"Was suggestive of peace and affection,"
3531,DOLORES,Not accents of anguish and woe.
3532,DOLORES,
3533,DOLORES,"Long ago, ere the foot of the white man"
3534,DOLORES,"Had left its first print on the sod,"
3535,DOLORES,"A people, both free and contented,"
3536,DOLORES,Her mesas and ca√±on-ways trod.
3537,DOLORES,"Then Dolores, the river of sorrow,"
3538,DOLORES,"Was a river of laughter and glee,"
3539,DOLORES,As she playfully dashed through the ca√±ons
3540,DOLORES,In her turbulent rush to the sea.
3541,DOLORES,
3542,DOLORES,"High up on the cliffs in their dwellings,"
3543,DOLORES,"Which were apertures walled up with rocks,"
3544,DOLORES,"Lived this people, sequestered and happy;"
3545,DOLORES,Their dwellings now serve the wild fox.
3546,DOLORES,"They planted the maize and potato,"
3547,DOLORES,"The kind river caused them to grow,"
3548,DOLORES,So they worshipped the river with singing
3549,DOLORES,Which blent with its musical flow.
3550,DOLORES,
3551,DOLORES,"This people, so artless and peaceful,"
3552,DOLORES,"Knew nothing of carnage and war,"
3553,DOLORES,But dwelt in such quiet and plenty
3554,DOLORES,They knew not what weapons were for.
3555,DOLORES,"They gathered the maize in its season,"
3556,DOLORES,Unmindful of famine or foe
3557,DOLORES,And chanted their thanks to the spirits
3558,DOLORES,That dwelt in the ca√±ons below.
3559,DOLORES,
3560,DOLORES,But one evil day from the Northland
3561,DOLORES,"Swept an army in battle array,"
3562,DOLORES,Which fell on this innocent people
3563,DOLORES,And massacred all in a day.
3564,DOLORES,"Their bodies were cast in the river,"
3565,DOLORES,"A feast for the vultures, when lo!"
3566,DOLORES,The laughter and song of the river
3567,DOLORES,Were changed to the wailing of woe.
3568,DOLORES,
3569,DOLORES,"Gone, gone are this people forever,"
3570,DOLORES,Not a vestige nor remnant remains
3571,DOLORES,To gather the maize in its season
3572,DOLORES,And join in the harvest refrains;
3573,DOLORES,But the river still mourns for her people
3574,DOLORES,"With weird and disconsolate flow,"
3575,DOLORES,"Dolores, the river of sorrow,"
3576,DOLORES,Dolores--the river of woe.

3927,MORTALITY,We call and list with ears attuned to hear;
3928,MORTALITY,"No sound is wafted, and no glimmering ray"
3929,MORTALITY,"Breaks from that night, unlit by moon or star;"
3930,MORTALITY,"Nor gleam, nor spark, nor modicum of light"
3931,MORTALITY,Is flashed from out the precincts of the tomb.
3932,MORTALITY,
3933,MORTALITY,"Death is the final principle of life,"
3934,MORTALITY,"The culmination of vicissitude,"
3935,MORTALITY,"The silent archer, whose unerring shaft"
3936,MORTALITY,Doth pierce at last the most unyielding breast;
3937,MORTALITY,"The reaper after whose fell harvesting,"
3938,MORTALITY,No gleaner bends nor follows in his wake.
3939,MORTALITY,"The gold of Ophir, and the pearls of Ind,"
3940,MORTALITY,"The sapphires and the rubies of the East,"
3941,MORTALITY,"Or all the treasures, which the fabled Gnomes,"
3942,MORTALITY,In subterranean vaults and passages
3943,MORTALITY,"Have guarded, multiplied by countless sums,"
3944,MORTALITY,With Euclid's most exalted numeral
3945,MORTALITY,"In computation, as the multiple"
3946,MORTALITY,"Of least proportion, for the passing breath"
3947,MORTALITY,"Can purchase neither respite nor reprieve,"
3948,MORTALITY,"Nor can prolong it, by one feeble gasp."
3949,MORTALITY,
3950,MORTALITY,"Nor fragrant balm, nor sweet preservative,"
3951,MORTALITY,"Nor caustic alkaloid, nor bitter herb"
3952,MORTALITY,"From Nature's various dispensary,"
3953,MORTALITY,"Elixir, lotion, nor restorative,"
3954,MORTALITY,Nor prophylactic nor catholicon
3955,MORTALITY,Nor pharmacy's most potent stimulant
3956,MORTALITY,"Can long retard the swift but viewless flight,"
3957,MORTALITY,Of that mysterious thing we call the Soul.
3958,MORTALITY,"Nor exorcism, nor the mystic power"
3959,MORTALITY,"Of incantation, nor of talisman,"
3960,MORTALITY,"Nor words of solemn theurgy pronounced,"
3961,MORTALITY,Can break or dissipate that pallid spell;
3962,MORTALITY,"Nor necromancy, nor phylactery,"
3963,MORTALITY,"Nor touch of magic wand, nor subtle force"
3964,MORTALITY,"Of conjuration, nor of sorcery, prevails"
3965,MORTALITY,Against the shadows of the tomb;
3966,MORTALITY,"Nor all the baleful arts of witchery,"
3967,MORTALITY,Nor amulet withstand the charm of death.
3968,MORTALITY,
3969,MORTALITY,"Yea, man who rules the passive elements,"
3970,MORTALITY,"Enchaining them to service at his will,"
3971,MORTALITY,Himself to death must yield obedience.
3972,MORTALITY,"Yea, man who, through all disadvantages"
3973,MORTALITY,"And obstacles, has hewed his way aloft,"
3974,MORTALITY,"From out the labyrinth of ignorance,"
3975,MORTALITY,"Who sways the sceptre over conquered realms,"
3976,MORTALITY,"Of latent energy and unseen force,"
3977,MORTALITY,"Without condition or conceding term,"
3978,MORTALITY,Surrenders to that sombre potentate.
3979,MORTALITY,
3980,MORTALITY,"Nor can in earth's remotest solitude,"
3981,MORTALITY,"In forest depths or undiscovered isle,"
3982,MORTALITY,In dismal cavern or secretive cave
3983,MORTALITY,Escape the mandate of that grizzly King.
3984,MORTALITY,"Nor wing of eagle, nor the fabled wings"
3985,MORTALITY,"Of hippogrif, of such velocity"
3986,MORTALITY,"As clothes the lightning and the thunderbolt,"
3987,MORTALITY,Outstrip in speed the shadowy wings of death.
3988,MORTALITY,
3989,MORTALITY,"We pass along an ever-travelled road,"
3990,MORTALITY,Worn by the silent and continuous tread
3991,MORTALITY,"Of throngs innumerable, of every clime;"
3992,MORTALITY,"The countless generations of the past,"
3993,MORTALITY,The uncomputed hosts and multitudes
3994,MORTALITY,"Who trod the earth in ages most remote,"
3995,MORTALITY,And those whose pale emaciated forms
3996,MORTALITY,"The generous earth hath recently received,"
3997,MORTALITY,The myriads of every race and tongue
3998,MORTALITY,"Who have preceded us, have sent no word"
3999,MORTALITY,[Blank Page]
4000,MORTALITY,"Of cheer or comfort from that silent strand,"
4001,MORTALITY,And no directions for our timorous steps.

4008,MORTALITY,"Grim Dissolution knows no favorites,"
4009,MORTALITY,But in his multiplicity of shapes
4010,MORTALITY,"Invades alike, with stern resistless step,"
4011,MORTALITY,"The squalid hovel with its noisome air,"
4012,MORTALITY,And palace most replete with opulence;
4013,MORTALITY,"Those of exalted station, and the hordes"
4014,MORTALITY,"To whom existence means but servitude,"
4015,MORTALITY,Who see the golden sun arise and bring
4016,MORTALITY,"No intermission from their ceaseless toil,"
4017,MORTALITY,Who hope for respite only with the night;
4018,MORTALITY,"Those who in dread reluctance shrank from death,"
4019,MORTALITY,"And those who neither knew nor cared the hour,"
4020,MORTALITY,"To life and death alike indifferent,"
4021,MORTALITY,Or fain themselves would snap the fragile thread;
4022,MORTALITY,Mankind in all conditions and degrees

4027,MORTALITY,"With pathways various and diversified,"
4028,MORTALITY,Have found their paths converging at the grave.
4029,MORTALITY,
4030,MORTALITY,"Each, as the gathering shadows of the night,"
4031,MORTALITY,"In solemn chaos of unfathomed gloom,"
4032,MORTALITY,"Descend in sombre, melancholy pall,"
4033,MORTALITY,"And mark apace life's transitory eve,"
4034,MORTALITY,"Must quaff, alike, the bitter draught of death,"
4035,MORTALITY,The one libation in which all who breathe
4036,MORTALITY,May in all equity participate.
4037,MORTALITY,"Each, at the expiration of his span,"
4038,MORTALITY,"Has found the same relentless terminal,"
4039,MORTALITY,"And faltering on dissolution's brink,"
4040,MORTALITY,"With what of strength, or guilt or innocence"
4041,MORTALITY,"Did mark the tenor of his brief career,"
4042,MORTALITY,"Has passed up to the margin of the grave,"
4043,MORTALITY,Then disappeared forever.
4044,MORTALITY,
4045,MORTALITY,What is Death?
4046,MORTALITY,"We know not, yet in verity we feel"
4047,MORTALITY,"That, though of most immediate concern,"
4048,MORTALITY,"And shrouded deep in sable mystery,"
4049,MORTALITY,"Though most abstruse, intangible and strange,"
4050,MORTALITY,'Tis not of our volition and control!
4051,MORTALITY,"It therefore proves, as life doth ever prove,"
4052,MORTALITY,"With all abundant plenitude of proof,"
4053,MORTALITY,"A Force superior to human strength,"
4054,MORTALITY,And should afford no premises for fear.
