179,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL
180,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
181,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
182,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Hannibal._ Could a Numidian horseman ride no faster? Marcellus! oh!
183,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,Marcellus! He moves not--he is dead. Did he not stir his fingers?
184,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"Stand wide, soldiers--wide, forty paces; give him air; bring water;"
185,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"halt! Gather those broad leaves, and all the rest, growing under the"
186,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,brushwood; unbrace his armour. Loose the helmet first--his breast
187,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,rises. I fancied his eyes were fixed on me--they have rolled back
188,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,again. Who presumed to touch my shoulder? This horse? It was surely
189,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"the horse of Marcellus! Let no man mount him. Ha! ha! the Romans, too,"
190,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,sink into luxury: here is gold about the charger.
191,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
192,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Gaulish Chieftain._ Execrable thief! The golden chain of our king
193,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,under a beast's grinders! The vengeance of the gods hath overtaken the
194,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,impure----
195,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
196,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"_Hannibal._ We will talk about vengeance when we have entered Rome,"
197,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"and about purity among the priests, if they will hear us. Sound for"
198,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"the surgeon. That arrow may be extracted from the side, deep as it is."
199,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,The conqueror of Syracuse lies before me. Send a vessel off to
200,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"Carthage. Say Hannibal is at the gates of Rome. Marcellus, who stood"
201,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"alone between us, fallen. Brave man! I would rejoice and cannot. How"
202,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,awfully serene a countenance! Such as we hear are in the islands of
203,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,the Blessed. And how glorious a form and stature! Such too was theirs!
204,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,They also once lay thus upon the earth wet with their blood--few other
205,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,enter there. And what plain armour!
206,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
207,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"_Gaulish Chieftain._ My party slew him; indeed, I think I slew him"
208,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,myself. I claim the chain: it belongs to my king; the glory of Gaul
209,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,requires it. Never will she endure to see another take it.
210,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
211,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"_Hannibal._ My friend, the glory of Marcellus did not require him to"
212,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"wear it. When he suspended the arms of your brave king in the temple,"
213,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,he thought such a trinket unworthy of himself and of Jupiter. The
214,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"shield he battered down, the breast-plate he pierced with his"
215,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,sword--these he showed to the people and to the gods; hardly his wife
216,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"and little children saw this, ere his horse wore it."
217,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
218,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Gaulish Chieftain._ Hear me; O Hannibal!
219,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
220,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Hannibal._ What! when Marcellus lies before me? when his life may
221,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,perhaps be recalled? when I may lead him in triumph to Carthage? when
222,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"Italy, Sicily, Greece, Asia, wait to obey me? Content thee! I will"
223,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"give thee mine own bridle, worth ten such."
224,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
225,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Gaulish Chieftain._ For myself?
226,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
227,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Hannibal._ For thyself.
228,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
229,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"_Gaulish Chieftain._ And these rubies and emeralds, and that"
230,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,scarlet----?
231,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
232,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"_Hannibal._ Yes, yes."
233,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
234,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Gaulish Chieftain._ O glorious Hannibal! unconquerable hero! O my
235,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,happy country! to have such an ally and defender. I swear eternal
236,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"gratitude--yes, gratitude, love, devotion, beyond eternity."
237,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
238,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Hannibal._ In all treaties we fix the time: I could hardly ask a
239,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"longer. Go back to thy station. I would see what the surgeon is about,"
240,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,and hear what he thinks. The life of Marcellus! the triumph of
241,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,Hannibal! what else has the world in it? Only Rome and Carthage: these
242,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,follow.
243,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
244,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Marcellus._ I must die then? The gods be praised! The commander of a
245,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,Roman army is no captive.
246,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
247,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Hannibal._ [_To the Surgeon._] Could not he bear a sea voyage?
248,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,Extract the arrow.
249,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
250,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Surgeon._ He expires that moment.
251,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
252,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Marcellus._ It pains me: extract it.
253,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
254,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"_Hannibal._ Marcellus, I see no expression of pain on your"
255,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"countenance, and never will I consent to hasten the death of an enemy"
256,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"in my power. Since your recovery is hopeless, you say truly you are no"
257,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,captive.
258,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
259,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"[_To the Surgeon._] Is there nothing, man, that can assuage the mortal"
260,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"pain? for, suppress the signs of it as he may, he must feel it. Is"
261,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,there nothing to alleviate and allay it?
262,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
263,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"_Marcellus._ Hannibal, give me thy hand--thou hast found it and"
264,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"brought it me, compassion."
265,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
266,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"[_To the Surgeon._] Go, friend; others want thy aid; several fell"
267,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,around me.
268,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
269,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"_Hannibal._ Recommend to your country, O Marcellus, while time permits"
270,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"it, reconciliation and peace with me, informing the Senate of my"
271,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"superiority in force, and the impossibility of resistance. The tablet"
272,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"is ready: let me take off this ring--try to write, to sign it, at"
273,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"least. Oh, what satisfaction I feel at seeing you able to rest upon"
274,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"the elbow, and even to smile!"
275,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
276,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"_Marcellus._ Within an hour or less, with how severe a brow would"
277,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"Minos say to me, 'Marcellus, is this thy writing?'"
278,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
279,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"Rome loses one man: she hath lost many such, and she still hath many"
280,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,left.
281,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
282,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"_Hannibal._ Afraid as you are of falsehood, say you this? I confess in"
283,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"shame the ferocity of my countrymen. Unfortunately, too, the nearer"
284,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"posts are occupied by Gauls, infinitely more cruel. The Numidians are"
285,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,so in revenge: the Gauls both in revenge and in sport. My presence is
286,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"required at a distance, and I apprehend the barbarity of one or other,"
287,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"learning, as they must do, your refusal to execute my wishes for the"
288,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"common good, and feeling that by this refusal you deprive them of"
289,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"their country, after so long an absence."
290,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
291,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"_Marcellus._ Hannibal, thou art not dying."
292,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
293,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Hannibal._ What then? What mean you?
294,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
295,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"_Marcellus._ That thou mayest, and very justly, have many things yet"
296,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,to apprehend: I can have none. The barbarity of thy soldiers is
297,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,nothing to me: mine would not dare be cruel. Hannibal is forced to be
298,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,absent; and his authority goes away with his horse. On this turf lies
299,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,defaced the semblance of a general; but Marcellus is yet the regulator
300,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,of his army. Dost thou abdicate a power conferred on thee by thy
301,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"nation? Or wouldst thou acknowledge it to have become, by thy own sole"
302,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"fault, less plenary than thy adversary's?"
303,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
304,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,I have spoken too much: let me rest; this mantle oppresses me.
305,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
306,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Hannibal._ I placed my mantle on your head when the helmet was first
307,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"removed, and while you were lying in the sun. Let me fold it under,"
308,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,and then replace the ring.
309,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
310,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"_Marcellus._ Take it, Hannibal. It was given me by a poor woman who"
311,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"flew to me at Syracuse, and who covered it with her hair, torn off in"
312,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,desperation that she had no other gift to offer. Little thought I that
313,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,her gift and her words should be mine. How suddenly may the most
314,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,powerful be in the situation of the most helpless! Let that ring and
315,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,the mantle under my head be the exchange of guests at parting. The
316,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"time may come, Hannibal, when thou (and the gods alone know whether as"
317,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"conqueror or conquered) mayest sit under the roof of my children, and"
318,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"in either case it shall serve thee. In thy adverse fortune, they will"
319,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,remember on whose pillow their father breathed his last; in thy
320,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,prosperity (Heaven grant it may shine upon thee in some other
321,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,country!) it will rejoice thee to protect them. We feel ourselves the
322,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"most exempt from affliction when we relieve it, although we are then"
323,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,the most conscious that it may befall us.
324,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
325,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,There is one thing here which is not at the disposal of either.
326,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
327,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Hannibal._ What?
328,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
329,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Marcellus._ This body.
330,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
331,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Hannibal._ Whither would you be lifted? Men are ready.
332,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
333,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Marcellus._ I meant not so. My strength is failing. I seem to hear
334,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,rather what is within than what is without. My sight and my other
335,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"senses are in confusion. I would have said--this body, when a few"
336,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"bubbles of air shall have left it, is no more worthy of thy notice"
337,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,than of mine; but thy glory will not let thee refuse it to the piety
338,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,of my family.
339,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
340,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Hannibal._ You would ask something else. I perceive an inquietude not
341,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,visible till now.
342,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
343,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Marcellus._ Duty and Death make us think of home sometimes.
344,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
345,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Hannibal._ Thitherward the thoughts of the conqueror and of the
346,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,conquered fly together.
347,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
348,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Marcellus._ Hast thou any prisoners from my escort?
349,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
350,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Hannibal._ A few dying lie about--and let them lie--they are Tuscans.
351,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"The remainder I saw at a distance, flying, and but one brave man among"
352,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"them--he appeared a Roman--a youth who turned back, though wounded."
353,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"They surrounded and dragged him away, spurring his horse with their"
354,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"swords. These Etrurians measure their courage carefully, and tack it"
355,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"well together before they put it on, but throw it off again with"
356,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,lordly ease.
357,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
358,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"Marcellus, why think about them? or does aught else disquiet your"
359,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,thoughts?
360,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
361,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Marcellus._ I have suppressed it long enough. My son--my beloved son!
362,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
363,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Hannibal._ Where is he? Can it be? Was he with you?
364,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
365,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,_Marcellus._ He would have shared my fate--and has not. Gods of my
366,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"country! beneficent throughout life to me, in death surpassingly"
367,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,"beneficent: I render you, for the last time, thanks."
368,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
369,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
370,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
371,MARCELLUS AND HANNIBAL,
372,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL
373,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
374,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
375,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"_Elizabeth._ I advise thee again, churlish Cecil, how that our Edmund"
376,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"Spenser, whom thou callest most uncourteously a whining whelp, hath"
377,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,good and solid reason for his complaint. God's blood! shall the lady
378,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"that tieth my garter and shuffles the smock over my head, or the lord"
379,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"that steadieth my chair's back while I eat, or the other that looketh"
380,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"to my buck-hounds lest they be mangy, be holden by me in higher esteem"
381,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"and estate than he who hath placed me among the bravest of past times,"
382,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,and will as safely and surely set me down among the loveliest in the
383,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,future?
384,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
385,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,_Cecil._ Your Highness must remember he carouseth fully for such
386,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"deserts: fifty pounds a year of unclipped moneys, and a butt of canary"
387,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"wine; not to mention three thousand acres in Ireland, worth fairly"
388,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"another fifty and another butt, in seasonable and quiet years."
389,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
390,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,_Elizabeth._ The moneys are not enough to sustain a pair of grooms and
391,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"a pair of palfreys, and more wine hath been drunken in my presence at"
392,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"a feast. The moneys are given to such men, that they may not incline"
393,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"nor be obligated to any vile or lowly occupation; and the canary, that"
394,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,they may entertain such promising wits as court their company and
395,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,converse; and that in such manner there may be alway in our land a
396,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"succession of these heirs unto fame. He hath written, not indeed with"
397,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"his wonted fancifulness, nor in learned and majestical language, but"
398,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"in homely and rustic wise, some verses which have moved me, and haply"
399,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,the more inasmuch as they demonstrate to me that his genius hath been
400,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,dampened by his adversities. Read them.
401,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
402,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,_Cecil._
403,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
404,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,How much is lost when neither heart nor eye
405,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,Rosewinged Desire or fabling Hope deceives;
406,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,When boyhood with quick throb hath ceased to spy
407,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,The dubious apple in the yellow leaves;
408,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
409,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"When, rising from the turf where youth reposed,"
410,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,We find but deserts in the far-sought shore;
411,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"When the huge book of Faery-land lies closed,"
412,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,And those strong brazen clasps will yield no more.
413,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
414,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,_Elizabeth._ The said Edmund hath also furnished unto the weaver at
415,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"Arras, John Blanquieres, on my account, a description for some of his"
416,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"cunningest wenches to work at, supplied by mine own self, indeed, as"
417,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"far as the subject-matter goes, but set forth by him with figures and"
418,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"fancies, and daintily enough bedecked. I could have wished he had"
419,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,thereunto joined a fair comparison between Dian--no matter--he might
420,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,perhaps have fared the better for it; but poets' wits--God help
421,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"them!--when did they ever sit close about them? Read the poesy, not"
422,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"over-rich, and concluding very awkwardly and meanly."
423,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
424,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,_Cecil._
425,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
426,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"Where forms the lotus, with its level leaves"
427,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"And solid blossoms, many floating isles,"
428,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,What heavenly radiance swift descending cleaves
429,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,The darksome wave! Unwonted beauty smiles
430,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
431,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"On its pure bosom, on each bright-eyed flower,"
432,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"On every nymph, and twenty sate around,"
433,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,Lo! 'twas Diana--from the sultry hour
434,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"Hither she fled, nor fear'd she sight or sound."
435,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
436,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"Unhappy youth, whom thirst and quiver-reeds"
437,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"Drew to these haunts, whom awe forbade to fly!"
438,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"Three faithful dogs before him rais'd their heads,"
439,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,And watched and wonder'd at that fix√®d eye.
440,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
441,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,Forth sprang his favourite--with her arrow-hand
442,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"Too late the goddess hid what hand may hide,"
443,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"Of every nymph and every reed complain'd,"
444,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,And dashed upon the bank the waters wide.
445,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
446,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,On the prone head and sandal'd feet they flew--
447,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,Lo! slender hoofs and branching horns appear!
448,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"The last marr'd voice not e'en the favourite knew,"
449,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,But bay'd and fasten'd on the upbraiding deer.
450,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
451,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"Far be, chaste goddess, far from me and mine"
452,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,The stream that tempts thee in the summer noon!
453,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"Alas, that vengeance dwells with charms divine----"
454,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
455,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,_Elizabeth._ Pshaw! give me the paper: I forewarned thee how it
456,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"ended--pitifully, pitifully."
457,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
458,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,_Cecil._ I cannot think otherwise than that the undertaker of the
459,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,aforecited poesy hath chosen your Highness; for I have seen painted--I
460,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"know not where, but I think no farther off than Putney--the"
461,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"identically same Dian, with full as many nymphs, as he calls them, and"
462,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,more dogs. So small a matter as a page of poesy shall never stir my
463,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,choler nor twitch my purse-string.
464,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
465,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"_Elizabeth._ I have read in Plinius and Mela of a runlet near Dodona,"
466,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"which kindled by approximation an unlighted torch, and extinguished a"
467,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"lighted one. Now, Cecil, I desire no such a jetty to be celebrated as"
468,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"the decoration of my court: in simpler words, which your gravity may"
469,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"more easily understand, I would not from the fountain of honour give"
470,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"lustre to the dull and ignorant, deadening and leaving in its tomb the"
471,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,lamp of literature and genius. I ardently wish my reign to be
472,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"remembered: if my actions were different from what they are, I should"
473,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"as ardently wish it to be forgotten. Those are the worst of suicides,"
474,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"who voluntarily and propensely stab or suffocate their fame, when God"
475,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,hath commanded them to stand on high for an example. We call him
476,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"parricide who destroys the author of his existence: tell me, what"
477,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,shall we call him who casts forth to the dogs and birds of prey its
478,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"most faithful propagator and most firm support? Mark me, I do not"
479,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,speak of that existence which the proudest must close in a ditch--the
480,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"narrowest, too, of ditches and the soonest filled and fouled, and"
481,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,whereunto a pinch of ratsbane or a poppy-head may bend him; but of
482,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"that which reposes on our own good deeds, carefully picked up,"
483,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"skilfully put together, and decorously laid out for us by another's"
484,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,kind understanding: I speak of an existence such as no father is
485,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"author of, or provides for. The parent gives us few days and"
486,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"sorrowful; the poet, many and glorious: the one (supposing him"
487,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,discreet and kindly) best reproves our faults; the other best
488,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,remunerates our virtues.
489,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
490,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,A page of poesy is a little matter: be it so; but of a truth I do tell
491,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"thee, Cecil, it shall master full many a bold heart that the Spaniard"
492,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,cannot trouble; it shall win to it full many a proud and flighty one
493,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,that even chivalry and manly comeliness cannot touch. I may shake
494,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,titles and dignities by the dozen from my breakfast-board; but I may
495,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,not save those upon whose heads I shake them from rottenness and
496,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,oblivion. This year they and their sovereign dwell together; next
497,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"year, they and their beagle. Both have names, but names perishable."
498,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,The keeper of my privy seal is an earl: what then? the keeper of my
499,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"poultry-yard is a Caesar. In honest truth, a name given to a man is no"
500,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,better than a skin given to him: what is not natively his own falls
501,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,off and comes to nothing.
502,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
503,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"I desire in future to hear no contempt of penmen, unless a depraved"
504,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,use of the pen shall have so cramped them as to incapacitate them for
505,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"the sword and for the council chamber. If Alexander was the Great,"
506,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"what was Aristoteles who made him so, and taught him every art and"
507,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"science he knew, except three--those of drinking, of blaspheming, and"
508,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,of murdering his bosom friends? Come along: I will bring thee back
509,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,again nearer home. Thou mightest toss and tumble in thy bed many
510,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"nights, and never eke out the substance of a stanza; but Edmund, if"
511,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"perchance I should call upon him for his counsel, would give me as"
512,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,wholesome and prudent as any of you. We should indemnify such men for
513,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"the injustice we do unto them in not calling them about us, and for"
514,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,the mortification they must suffer at seeing their inferiors set
515,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"before them. Edmund is grave and gentle: he complains of fortune, not"
516,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"of Elizabeth; of courts, not of Cecil. I am resolved--so help me,"
517,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"God!--he shall have no further cause for his repining. Go, convey unto"
518,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"him those twelve silver spoons, with the apostles on them, gloriously"
519,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"gilded; and deliver into his hand these twelve large golden pieces,"
520,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,sufficing for the yearly maintenance of another horse and groom.
521,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"Beside which, set open before him with due reverence this Bible,"
522,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,wherein he may read the mercies of God toward those who waited in
523,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"patience for His blessing; and this pair of crimson silk hose, which"
524,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"thou knowest I have worn only thirteen months, taking heed that the"
525,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"heel-piece be put into good and sufficient restoration, at my sole"
526,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,"charges, by the Italian woman nigh the pollard elm at Charing Cross."
527,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
528,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
529,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
530,QUEEN ELIZABETH AND CECIL,
531,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,EPICTETUS AND SENECA
532,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
533,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
534,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Seneca._ Epictetus, I desired your master, Epaphroditus, to send you"
535,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"hither, having been much pleased with his report of your conduct, and"
536,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,much surprised at the ingenuity of your writings.
537,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
538,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ Then I am afraid, my friend----"
539,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
540,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Seneca._ _My friend!_ are these the expressions--Well, let it pass."
541,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,Philosophers must bear bravely. The people expect it.
542,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
543,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ Are philosophers, then, only philosophers for the people;"
544,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"and, instead of instructing them, must they play tricks before them?"
545,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,Give me rather the gravity of dancing dogs. Their motions are for the
546,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,rabble; their reverential eyes and pendant paws are under the
547,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"pressure of awe at a master; but they are dogs, and not below their"
548,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,destinies.
549,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
550,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ Epictetus! I will give you three talents to let me take that
551,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,sentiment for my own.
552,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
553,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ I would give thee twenty, if I had them, to make it"
554,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,thine.
555,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
556,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Seneca._ You mean, by lending it the graces of my language?"
557,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
558,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ I mean, by lending it to thy conduct. And now let me"
559,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"console and comfort thee, under the calamity I brought on thee by"
560,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"calling thee _my friend_. If thou art not my friend, why send for me?"
561,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"Enemy I can have none: being a slave, Fortune has now done with me."
562,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
563,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Seneca._ Continue, then, your former observations. What were you"
564,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,saying?
565,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
566,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Epictetus._ That which thou interruptedst.
567,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
568,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ What was it?
569,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
570,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ I should have remarked that, if thou foundest ingenuity"
571,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"in my writings, thou must have discovered in them some deviation from"
572,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"the plain, homely truths of Zeno and Cleanthes."
573,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
574,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ We all swerve a little from them.
575,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
576,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Epictetus._ In practice too?
577,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
578,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Seneca._ Yes, even in practice, I am afraid."
579,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
580,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Epictetus._ Often?
581,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
582,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ Too often.
583,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
584,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ Strange! I have been attentive, and yet have remarked but"
585,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,one difference among you great personages at Rome.
586,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
587,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ What difference fell under your observation?
588,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
589,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Epictetus._ Crates and Zeno and Cleanthes taught us that our desires
590,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"were to be subdued by philosophy alone. In this city, their acute and"
591,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"inventive scholars take us aside, and show us that there is not only"
592,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"one way, but two."
593,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
594,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ Two ways?
595,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
596,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ They whisper in our ear, 'These two ways are philosophy"
597,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"and enjoyment: the wiser man will take the readier, or, not finding"
598,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"it, the alternative.' Thou reddenest."
599,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
600,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ Monstrous degeneracy.
601,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
602,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Epictetus._ What magnificent rings! I did not notice them until thou
603,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"liftedst up thy hands to heaven, in detestation of such effeminacy and"
604,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,impudence.
605,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
606,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ The rings are not amiss; my rank rivets them upon my
607,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"fingers: I am forced to wear them. Our emperor gave me one,"
608,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"Epaphroditus another, Tigellinus the third. I cannot lay them aside a"
609,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"single day, for fear of offending the gods, and those whom they love"
610,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,the most worthily.
611,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
612,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ Although they make thee stretch out thy fingers, like the"
613,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,arms and legs of one of us slaves upon a cross.
614,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
615,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Seneca._ Oh, horrible! Find some other resemblance."
616,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
617,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Epictetus._ The extremities of a fig-leaf.
618,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
619,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ Ignoble!
620,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
621,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ The claws of a toad, trodden on or stoned."
622,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
623,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Seneca._ You have great need, Epictetus, of an instructor in"
624,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"eloquence and rhetoric: you want topics, and tropes, and figures."
625,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
626,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Epictetus._ I have no room for them. They make such a buzz in the
627,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"house, a man's own wife cannot understand what he says to her."
628,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
629,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Seneca._ Let us reason a little upon style. I would set you right,"
630,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,and remove from before you the prejudices of a somewhat rustic
631,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,education. We may adorn the simplicity of the wisest.
632,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
633,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Epictetus._ Thou canst not adorn simplicity. What is naked or
634,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,defective is susceptible of decoration: what is decorated is
635,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,simplicity no longer. Thou mayest give another thing in exchange for
636,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"it; but if thou wert master of it, thou wouldst preserve it inviolate."
637,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"It is no wonder that we mortals, little able as we are to see truth,"
638,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,should be less able to express it.
639,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
640,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ You have formed at present no idea of style.
641,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
642,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ I never think about it. First, I consider whether what I"
643,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"am about to say is true; then, whether I can say it with brevity, in"
644,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,such a manner as that others shall see it as clearly as I do in the
645,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"light of truth; for, if they survey it as an ingenuity, my desire is"
646,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"ungratified, my duty unfulfilled. I go not with those who dance round"
647,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"the image of Truth, less out of honour to her than to display their"
648,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,agility and address.
649,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
650,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Seneca._ We must attract the attention of readers by novelty, and"
651,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"force, and grandeur of expression."
652,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
653,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ We must. Nothing is so grand as truth, nothing so"
654,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"forcible, nothing so novel."
655,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
656,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ Sonorous sentences are wanted to awaken the lethargy of
657,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,indolence.
658,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
659,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Epictetus._ Awaken it to what? Here lies the question; and a weighty
660,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,one it is. If thou awakenest men where they can see nothing and do no
661,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"work, it is better to let them rest: but will not they, thinkest thou,"
662,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"look up at a rainbow, unless they are called to it by a clap of"
663,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,thunder?
664,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
665,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Seneca._ Your early youth, Epictetus, has been, I will not say"
666,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"neglected, but cultivated with rude instruments and unskilful hands."
667,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
668,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Epictetus._ I thank God for it. Those rude instruments have left the
669,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,turf lying yet toward the sun; and those unskilful hands have plucked
670,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,out the docks.
671,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
672,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ We hope and believe that we have attained a vein of
673,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"eloquence, brighter and more varied than has been hitherto laid open"
674,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,to the world.
675,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
676,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Epictetus._ Than any in the Greek?
677,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
678,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ We trust so.
679,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
680,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Epictetus._ Than your Cicero's?
681,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
682,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ If the declaration may be made without an offence to
683,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"modesty. Surely, you cannot estimate or value the eloquence of that"
684,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,noble pleader?
685,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
686,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ Imperfectly, not being born in Italy; and the noble"
687,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,pleader is a much less man with me than the noble philosopher. I
688,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"regret that, having farms and villas, he would not keep his distance"
689,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"from the pumping up of foul words against thieves, cut-throats, and"
690,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"other rogues; and that he lied, sweated, and thumped his head and"
691,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"thighs, in behalf of those who were no better."
692,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
693,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Seneca._ Senators must have clients, and must protect them."
694,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
695,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Epictetus._ Innocent or guilty?
696,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
697,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ Doubtless.
698,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
699,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ If I regret what is and might not be, I may regret more"
700,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"what both is and must be. However, it is an amiable thing, and no"
701,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"small merit in the wealthy, even to trifle and play at their leisure"
702,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,hours with philosophy. It cannot be expected that such a personage
703,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"should espouse her, or should recommend her as an inseparable mate to"
704,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,his heir.
705,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
706,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ I would.
707,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
708,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ Yes, Seneca, but thou hast no son to make the match for;"
709,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"and thy recommendation, I suspect, would be given him before he could"
710,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,consummate the marriage. Every man wishes his sons to be philosophers
711,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"while they are young; but takes especial care, as they grow older, to"
712,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,teach them its insufficiency and unfitness for their intercourse with
713,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,mankind. The paternal voice says: 'You must not be particular; you are
714,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,about to have a profession to live by; follow those who have thriven
715,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"the best in it.' Now, among these, whatever be the profession, canst"
716,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,thou point out to me one single philosopher?
717,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
718,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Seneca._ Not just now; nor, upon reflection, do I think it feasible."
719,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
720,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ Thou, indeed, mayest live much to thy ease and"
721,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"satisfaction with philosophy, having (they say) two thousand talents."
722,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
723,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ And a trifle to spare--pressed upon me by that godlike
724,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"youth, my pupil Nero."
725,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
726,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"_Epictetus._ Seneca! where God hath placed a mine, He hath placed the"
727,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,materials of an earthquake.
728,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
729,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Seneca._ A true philosopher is beyond the reach of Fortune.
730,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,
731,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,_Epictetus._ The false one thinks himself so. Fortune cares little
732,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,"about philosophers; but she remembers where she hath set a rich man,"
733,EPICTETUS AND SENECA,and she laughs to see the Destinies at his door.

739,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
740,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
741,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ And so, after flying from thy father's house, thou hast"
742,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"returned again from Vienna. After this affront in the face of Europe,"
743,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,thou darest to appear before me?
744,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
745,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Alexis._ My emperor and father! I am brought before your Majesty, not"
746,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,at my own desire.
747,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
748,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ I believe it well.
749,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
750,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ I would not anger you.
751,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
752,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ What hope hadst thou, rebel, in thy flight to Vienna?"
753,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
754,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Alexis._ The hope of peace and privacy; the hope of security; and,"
755,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"above all things, of never more offending you."
756,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
757,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ That hope thou hast accomplished. Thou imaginedst, then, that"
758,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,my brother of Austria would maintain thee at his court--speak!
759,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
760,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Alexis._ No, sir! I imagined that he would have afforded me a place"
761,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,of refuge.
762,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
763,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ Didst thou, then, take money with thee?"
764,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
765,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ A few gold pieces.
766,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
767,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ How many?
768,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
769,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ About sixty.
770,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
771,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ He would have given thee promises for half the money; but the
772,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"double of it does not purchase a house, ignorant wretch!"
773,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
774,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ I knew as much as that: although my birth did not appear to
775,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"destine me to purchase a house anywhere; and hitherto your liberality,"
776,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"my father, hath supplied my wants of every kind."
777,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
778,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ Not of wisdom, not of duty, not of spirit, not of courage,"
779,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"not of ambition. I have educated thee among my guards and horses,"
780,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"among my drums and trumpets, among my flags and masts. When thou wert"
781,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"a child, and couldst hardly walk, I have taken thee into the arsenal,"
782,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,though children should not enter according to regulations: I have
783,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,there rolled cannon-balls before thee over iron plates; and I have
784,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"shown thee bright new arms, bayonets and sabres; and I have pricked"
785,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,the back of my hands until the blood came out in many places; and I
786,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,have made thee lick it; and I have then done the same to thine.
787,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"Afterward, from thy tenth year, I have mixed gunpowder in thy grog; I"
788,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,have peppered thy peaches; I have poured bilge-water (with a little
789,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,good wholesome tar in it) upon thy melons; I have brought out girls to
790,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"mock thee and cocker thee, and talk like mariners, to make thee"
791,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"braver. Nothing would do. Nay, recollect thee! I have myself led thee"
792,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,forth to the window when fellows were hanged and shot; and I have
793,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,shown thee every day the halves and quarters of bodies; and I have
794,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,sent an orderly or chamberlain for the heads; and I have pulled the
795,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"cap up from over the eyes; and I have made thee, in spite of thee,"
796,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"look steadfastly upon them, incorrigible coward!"
797,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
798,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,And now another word with thee about thy scandalous flight from the
799,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"palace, in time of quiet, too! To the point! Did my brother of Austria"
800,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"invite thee? Did he, or did he not?"
801,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
802,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ May I answer without doing an injury or disservice to his
803,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,Imperial Majesty?
804,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
805,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ Thou mayest. What injury canst thou or any one do, by the"
806,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"tongue, to such as he is?"
807,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
808,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Alexis._ At the moment, no; he did not. Nor indeed can I assert that"
809,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,he at any time invited me; but he said he pitied me.
810,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
811,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ About what? hold thy tongue; let that pass. Princes never
812,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,pity but when they would make traitors: then their hearts grow
813,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"tenderer than tripe. He pitied thee, kind soul, when he would throw"
814,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"thee at thy father's head; but finding thy father too strong for him,"
815,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"he now commiserates the parent, laments the son's rashness and"
816,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"disobedience, and would not make God angry for the world. At first,"
817,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"however, there must have been some overture on his part; otherwise"
818,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,thou are too shamefaced for intrusion. Come--thou hast never had wit
819,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"enough to lie--tell me the truth, the whole truth."
820,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
821,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Alexis._ He said that if ever I wanted an asylum, his court was open"
822,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,to me.
823,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
824,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ Open! so is the tavern; but folks pay for what they get
825,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"there. Open, truly! and didst thou find it so?"
826,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
827,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ He received me kindly.
828,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
829,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ I see he did.
830,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
831,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Alexis._ Derision, O my father! is not the fate I merit."
832,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
833,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ True, true! it was not intended."
834,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
835,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ Kind father! punish me then as you will.
836,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
837,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ Villain! wouldst thou kiss my hand, too? Art thou ignorant"
838,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"that the Austrian threw thee away from him, with the same indifference"
839,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,as he would the outermost leaf of a sandy sunburnt lettuce?
840,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
841,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ Alas! I am not ignorant of this.
842,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
843,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ He dismissed thee at my order. If I had demanded from him his
844,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"daughter, to be the bedfellow of a Kalmuc, he would have given her,"
845,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,and praised God.
846,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
847,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ O father! is his baseness my crime?
848,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
849,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ No; thine is greater. Thy intention, I know, is to subvert"
850,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,the institutions it has been the labour of my lifetime to establish.
851,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,Thou hast never rejoiced at my victories.
852,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
853,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ I have rejoiced at your happiness and your safety.
854,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
855,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ Liar! coward! traitor! when the Polanders and Swedes fell
856,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"before me, didst thou from thy soul congratulate me? Didst thou get"
857,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"drunk at home or abroad, or praise the Lord of Hosts and Saint"
858,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,Nicholas? Wert thou not silent and civil and low-spirited?
859,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
860,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ I lamented the irretrievable loss of human life; I lamented
861,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,that the bravest and noblest were swept away the first; that the
862,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,gentlest and most domestic were the earliest mourners; that frugality
863,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,was supplanted by intemperance; that order was succeeded by confusion;
864,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,and that your Majesty was destroying the glorious plans you alone were
865,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,capable of devising.
866,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
867,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ I destroy them! how? Of what plans art thou speaking?
868,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
869,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ Of civilizing the Muscovites. The Polanders in part were
870,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"civilized: the Swedes, more than any other nation on the Continent;"
871,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"and so excellently versed were they in military science, and so"
872,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"courageous, that every man you killed cost you seven or eight."
873,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
874,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ Thou liest; nor six. And civilized, forsooth? Why, the robes"
875,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"of the metropolitan, him at Upsal, are not worth three ducats, between"
876,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,Jew and Livornese. I have no notion that Poland and Sweden shall be
877,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,the only countries that produce great princes. What right have they to
878,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,such as Gustavus and Sobieski? Europe ought to look to this before
879,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"discontents become general, and the people do to us what we have the"
880,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,privilege of doing to the people. I am wasting my words: there is no
881,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,arguing with positive fools like thee. So thou wouldst have desired me
882,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,to let the Polanders and Swedes lie still and quiet! Two such powerful
883,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,nations!
884,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
885,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ For that reason and others I would have gladly seen them
886,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"rest, until our own people had increased in numbers and prosperity."
887,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
888,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ And thus thou disputest my right, before my face, to the"
889,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,exercise of the supreme power.
890,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
891,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ Sir! God forbid!
892,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
893,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ God forbid, indeed! What care such villains as thou art what"
894,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,God forbids! He forbids the son to be disobedient to the father; He
895,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"forbids--He forbids--twenty things. I do not wish, and will not have,"
896,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,a successor who dreams of dead people.
897,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
898,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Alexis._ My father! I have dreamed of none such.
899,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
900,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ Thou hast, and hast talked about them--Scythians, I think,"
901,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"they call 'em. Now, who told thee, Mr. Professor, that the Scythians"
902,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,were a happier people than we are; that they were inoffensive; that
903,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,they were free; that they wandered with their carts from pasture to
904,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"pasture, from river to river; that they traded with good faith; that"
905,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"they fought with good courage; that they injured none, invaded none,"
906,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,and feared none? At this rate I have effected nothing. The great
907,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"founder of Rome, I heard in Holland, slew his brother for despiting"
908,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,the weakness of his walls; and shall the founder of this better place
909,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"spare a degenerate son, who prefers a vagabond life to a civilized"
910,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"one, a cart to a city, a Scythian to a Muscovite? Have I not shaved my"
911,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"people, and breeched them? Have I not formed them into regular armies,"
912,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,with bands of music and haversacks? Are bows better than cannon?
913,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"shepherds than dragoons, mare's milk than brandy, raw steaks than"
914,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,broiled? Thine are tenets that strike at the root of politeness and
915,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,sound government. Every prince in Europe is interested in rooting them
916,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,out by fire and sword. There is no other way with false doctrines:
917,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,breath against breath does little.
918,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
919,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Alexis._ Sire, I never have attempted to disseminate my opinions."
920,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
921,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ How couldst thou? the seed would fall only on granite. Those,"
922,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"however, who caught it brought it to me."
923,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
924,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Alexis._ Never have I undervalued civilization: on the contrary, I"
925,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"regretted whatever impeded it. In my opinion, the evils that have been"
926,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,attributed to it sprang from its imperfections and voids; and no
927,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,nation has yet acquired it more than very scantily.
928,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
929,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ How so? give me thy reasons--thy fancies, rather; for reason"
930,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,thou hast none.
931,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
932,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Alexis._ When I find the first of men, in rank and genius, hating one"
933,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"another, and becoming slanderers and liars in order to lower and"
934,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"vilify an opponent; when I hear the God of mercy invoked to massacres,"
935,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,and thanked for furthering what He reprobates and condemns--I look
936,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,back in vain on any barbarous people for worse barbarism. I have
937,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"expressed my admiration of our forefathers, who, not being Christians,"
938,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"were yet more virtuous than those who are; more temperate, more just,"
939,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"more sincere, more chaste, more peaceable."
940,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
941,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ Malignant atheist!
942,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
943,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Alexis._ Indeed, my father, were I malignant I must be an atheist;"
944,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"for malignity is contrary to the command, and inconsistent with the"
945,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"belief, of God."
946,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
947,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ Am I Czar of Muscovy, and hear discourses on reason and"
948,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"religion? from my own son, too! No, by the Holy Trinity! thou art no"
949,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"son of mine. If thou touchest my knee again, I crack thy knuckles with"
950,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,this tobacco-stopper: I wish it were a sledge-hammer for thy sake.
951,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"Off, sycophant! Off, runaway slave!"
952,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
953,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Alexis._ Father! father! my heart is broken! If I have offended,"
954,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,forgive me!
955,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
956,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ The State requires thy signal punishment.
957,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
958,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Alexis._ If the State requires it, be it so; but let my father's"
959,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,anger cease!
960,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
961,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ The world shall judge between us. I will brand thee with
962,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,infamy.
963,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
964,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Alexis._ Until now, O father! I never had a proper sense of glory."
965,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"Hear me, O Czar! let not a thing so vile as I am stand between you and"
966,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,the world! Let none accuse you!
967,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
968,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ Accuse me, rebel! Accuse me, traitor!"
969,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
970,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Alexis._ Let none speak ill of you, O my father! The public voice"
971,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,shakes the palace; the public voice penetrates the grave; it precedes
972,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"the chariot of Almighty God, and is heard at the judgment-seat."
973,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
974,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ Let it go to the devil! I will have none of it here in
975,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,Petersburg. Our church says nothing about it; our laws forbid it. As
976,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"for thee, unnatural brute, I have no more to do with thee neither!"
977,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
978,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"Ho, there! chancellor! What! come at last! Wert napping, or counting"
979,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,thy ducats?
980,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
981,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Chancellor._ Your Majesty's will and pleasure!
982,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
983,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ Is the Senate assembled in that room?
984,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
985,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Chancellor._ Every member, sire."
986,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
987,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ Conduct this youth with thee, and let them judge him; thou"
988,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,understandest me.
989,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
990,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Chancellor._ Your Majesty's commands are the breath of our nostrils.
991,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
992,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ If these rascals are amiss, I will try my new cargo of"
993,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,Livonian hemp upon 'em.
994,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
995,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Chancellor._ [_Returning._] Sire, sire!"
996,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
997,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ Speak, fellow! Surely they have not condemned him to death,"
998,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"without giving themselves time to read the accusation, that thou"
999,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,comest back so quickly.
1000,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1001,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Chancellor._ No, sire! Nor has either been done."
1002,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1003,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ Then thy head quits thy shoulders.
1004,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1005,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Chancellor._ O sire!
1006,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1007,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ Curse thy silly _sires_! what art thou about?
1008,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1009,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Chancellor._ Alas! he fell.
1010,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1011,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ Tie him up to thy chair, then. Cowardly beast! what made him"
1012,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,fall?
1013,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1014,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Chancellor._ The hand of Death; the name of father.
1015,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1016,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ Thou puzzlest me; prithee speak plainlier.
1017,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1018,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Chancellor._ We told him that his crime was proven and manifest; that
1019,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,his life was forfeited.
1020,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1021,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ So far, well enough."
1022,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1023,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Chancellor._ He smiled.
1024,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1025,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ He did! did he? Impudence shall do him little good. Who could
1026,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,have expected it from that smock-face! Go on--what then?
1027,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1028,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Chancellor._ He said calmly, but not without sighing twice or thrice,"
1029,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,'Lead me to the scaffold: I am weary of life; nobody loves me.' I
1030,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"condoled with him, and wept upon his hand, holding the paper against"
1031,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"my bosom. He took the corner of it between his fingers, and said,"
1032,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,'Read me this paper; read my death-warrant. Your silence and tears
1033,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,have signified it; yet the law has its forms. Do not keep me in
1034,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"suspense. My father says, too truly, I am not courageous; but the"
1035,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,death that leads me to my God shall never terrify me.'
1036,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1037,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ I have seen these white-livered knaves die resolutely; I have
1038,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,seen them quietly fierce like white ferrets with their watery eyes and
1039,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,tiny teeth. You read it?
1040,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1041,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Chancellor._ In part, sire! When he heard your Majesty's name"
1042,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"accusing him of treason and attempts at rebellion and parricide, he"
1043,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,fell speechless. We raised him up: he was motionless; he was dead!
1044,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1045,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Peter._ Inconsiderate and barbarous varlet as thou art, dost thou"
1046,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,recite this ill accident to a father! and to one who has not dined!
1047,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,Bring me a glass of brandy.
1048,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1049,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"_Chancellor._ And it please your Majesty, might I call a--a----"
1050,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1051,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,_Peter._ Away and bring it: scamper! All equally and alike shall obey
1052,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,and serve me.
1053,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1054,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,Hark ye! bring the bottle with it: I must cool myself--and--hark ye! a
1055,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"rasher of bacon on thy life! and some pickled sturgeon, and some krout"
1056,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,"and caviare, and good strong cheese."
1057,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1058,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,
1059,PETER THE GREAT AND ALEXIS,

1061,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN
1062,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1063,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1064,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ Dost thou know me, Nanny, in this yeoman's dress? 'Sblood!"
1065,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,does it require so long and vacant a stare to recollect a husband
1066,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"after a week or two? No tragedy-tricks with me! a scream, a sob, or"
1067,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"thy kerchief a trifle the wetter, were enough. Why, verily the little"
1068,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"fool faints in earnest. These whey faces, like their kinsfolk the"
1069,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"ghosts, give us no warning. Hast had water enough upon thee? Take"
1070,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"that, then: art thyself again?"
1071,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1072,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ Father of mercies! do I meet again my husband, as was my last"
1073,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"prayer on earth? Do I behold my beloved lord--in peace--and pardoned,"
1074,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,my partner in eternal bliss? it was his voice. I cannot see him: why
1075,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"cannot I? Oh, why do these pangs interrupt the transports of the"
1076,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,blessed?
1077,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1078,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ Thou openest thy arms: faith! I came for that. Nanny, thou"
1079,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"art a sweet slut. Thou groanest, wench: art in labour? Faith! among"
1080,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"the mistakes of the night, I am ready to think almost that thou hast"
1081,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"been drinking, and that I have not."
1082,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1083,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ God preserve your Highness: grant me your forgiveness for one
1084,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,slight offence. My eyes were heavy; I fell asleep while I was reading.
1085,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"I did not know of your presence at first; and, when I did, I could"
1086,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,not speak. I strove for utterance: I wanted no respect for my liege
1087,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,and husband.
1088,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1089,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ My pretty warm nestling, thou wilt then lie! Thou wert"
1090,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"reading, and aloud too, with thy saintly cup of water by thee,"
1091,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,and--what! thou art still girlishly fond of those dried cherries!
1092,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1093,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ I had no other fruit to offer your Highness the first time I
1094,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"saw you, and you were then pleased to invent for me some reason why"
1095,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"they should be acceptable. I did not dry these: may I present them,"
1096,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,such as they are? We shall have fresh next month.
1097,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1098,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ Thou art always driving away from the discourse. One moment
1099,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"it suits thee to know me, another not."
1100,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1101,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ Remember, it is hardly three months since I miscarried. I am"
1102,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"weak, and liable to swoons."
1103,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1104,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ Thou hast, however, thy bridal cheeks, with lustre upon them"
1105,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"when there is none elsewhere, and obstinate lips resisting all"
1106,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"impression; but, now thou talkest about miscarrying, who is the father"
1107,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,of that boy?
1108,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1109,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ Yours and mine--He who hath taken him to his own home, before"
1110,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,(like me) he could struggle or cry for it.
1111,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1112,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ Pagan, or worse, to talk so! He did not come into the world"
1113,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,alive: there was no baptism.
1114,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1115,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ I thought only of our loss: my senses are confounded. I did
1116,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"not give him my milk, and yet I loved him tenderly; for I often"
1117,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"fancied, had he lived, how contented and joyful he would have made you"
1118,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,and England.
1119,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1120,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ No subterfuges and escapes. I warrant, thou canst not say"
1121,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,whether at my entrance thou wert waking or wandering.
1122,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1123,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ Faintness and drowsiness came upon me suddenly.
1124,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1125,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ Well, since thou really and truly sleepedst, what didst dream"
1126,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,of?
1127,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1128,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ I begin to doubt whether I did indeed sleep.
1129,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1130,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ Ha! false one--never two sentences of truth together! But
1131,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"come, what didst think about, asleep or awake?"
1132,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1133,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ I thought that God had pardoned me my offences, and had"
1134,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,received me unto Him.
1135,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1136,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ And nothing more?
1137,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1138,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ That my prayers had been heard and my wishes were
1139,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,accomplishing: the angels alone can enjoy more beatitude than this.
1140,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1141,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ Vexatious little devil! She says nothing now about me, merely"
1142,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"from perverseness. Hast thou never thought about me, nor about thy"
1143,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,falsehood and adultery?
1144,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1145,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ If I had committed any kind of falsehood, in regard to you or"
1146,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"not, I should never have rested until I had thrown myself at your feet"
1147,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"and obtained your pardon; but, if ever I had been guilty of that other"
1148,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"crime, I know not whether I should have dared to implore it, even of"
1149,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,God's mercy.
1150,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1151,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ Thou hast heretofore cast some soft glances upon Smeaton;
1152,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,hast thou not?
1153,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1154,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ He taught me to play on the virginals, as you know, when I was"
1155,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"little, and thereby to please your Highness."
1156,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1157,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ And Brereton and Norris--what have they taught thee?
1158,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1159,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ They are your servants, and trusty ones."
1160,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1161,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ Has not Weston told thee plainly that he loved thee?
1162,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1163,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ Yes; and----
1164,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1165,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ What didst thou?
1166,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1167,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ I defied him.
1168,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1169,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ Is that all?
1170,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1171,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ I could have done no more if he had told me that he hated me.
1172,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"Then, indeed, I should have incurred more justly the reproaches of"
1173,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,your Highness: I should have smiled.
1174,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1175,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ We have proofs abundant: the fellows shall one and all
1176,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"confront thee. Aye, clap thy hands and kiss thy sleeve, harlot!"
1177,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1178,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ Oh that so great a favour is vouchsafed me! My honour is
1179,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,secure; my husband will be happy again; he will see my innocence.
1180,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1181,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ Give me now an account of the moneys thou hast received from
1182,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,me within these nine months. I want them not back: they are letters of
1183,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,gold in record of thy guilt. Thou hast had no fewer than fifteen
1184,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"thousand pounds in that period, without even thy asking; what hast"
1185,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"done with it, wanton?"
1186,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1187,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ I have regularly placed it out to interest.
1188,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1189,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ Where? I demand of thee.
1190,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1191,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ Among the needy and ailing. My Lord Archbishop has the account
1192,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"of it, sealed by him weekly. I also had a copy myself; those who took"
1193,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"away my papers may easily find it; for there are few others, and they"
1194,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,lie open.
1195,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1196,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ Think on my munificence to thee; recollect who made thee.
1197,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,Dost sigh for what thou hast lost?
1198,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1199,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ I do, indeed."
1200,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1201,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ I never thought thee ambitious; but thy vices creep out one
1202,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,by one.
1203,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1204,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ I do not regret that I have been a queen and am no longer
1205,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,one; nor that my innocence is called in question by those who never
1206,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"knew me; but I lament that the good people who loved me so cordially,"
1207,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,hate and curse me; that those who pointed me out to their daughters
1208,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,for imitation check them when they speak about me; and that he whom
1209,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,next to God I have served with most devotion is my accuser.
1210,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1211,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ Wast thou conning over something in that dingy book for thy
1212,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"defence? Come, tell me, what wast thou reading?"
1213,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1214,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ This ancient chronicle. I was looking for someone in my own
1215,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"condition, and must have missed the page. Surely in so many hundred"
1216,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"years there shall have been other young maidens, first too happy for"
1217,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"exaltation, and after too exalted for happiness--not, perchance,"
1218,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"doomed to die upon a scaffold, by those they ever honoured and served"
1219,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"faithfully; that, indeed, I did not look for nor think of; but my"
1220,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,heart was bounding for any one I could love and pity. She would be
1221,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"unto me as a sister dead and gone; but hearing me, seeing me,"
1222,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"consoling me, and being consoled. O my husband! it is so heavenly a"
1223,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,thing----
1224,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1225,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ To whine and whimper, no doubt, is vastly heavenly."
1226,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1227,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ I said not so; but those, if there be any such, who never"
1228,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"weep, have nothing in them of heavenly or of earthly. The plants, the"
1229,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"trees, the very rocks and unsunned clouds, show us at least the"
1230,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,semblances of weeping; and there is not an aspect of the globe we live
1231,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"on, nor of the waters and skies around it, without a reference and a"
1232,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,similitude to our joys or sorrows.
1233,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1234,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ I do not remember that notion anywhere. Take care no enemy
1235,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,rake out of it something of materialism. Guard well thy empty hot
1236,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"brain; it may hatch more evil. As for those odd words, I myself would"
1237,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"fain see no great harm in them, knowing that grief and frenzy strike"
1238,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"out many things which would else lie still, and neither spurt nor"
1239,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,sparkle. I also know that thou hast never read anything but Bible and
1240,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"history--the two worst books in the world for young people, and the"
1241,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,most certain to lead astray both prince and subject. For which reason
1242,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"I have interdicted and entirely put down the one, and will (by the"
1243,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,blessing of the Virgin and of holy Paul) commit the other to a rigid
1244,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,censor. If it behoves us kings to enact what our people shall eat and
1245,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,drink--of which the most unruly and rebellious spirit can entertain no
1246,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,doubt--greatly more doth it behove us to examine what they read and
1247,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,think. The body is moved according to the mind and will; we must take
1248,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"care that the movement be a right one, on pain of God's anger in this"
1249,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,life and the next.
1250,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1251,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ O my dear husband! it must be a naughty thing, indeed, that"
1252,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,makes Him angry beyond remission. Did you ever try how pleasant it is
1253,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,to forgive any one? There is nothing else wherein we can resemble God
1254,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,perfectly and easily.
1255,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1256,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ Resemble God perfectly and easily! Do vile creatures talk
1257,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,thus of the Creator?
1258,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1259,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ No, Henry, when His creatures talk thus of Him, they are no"
1260,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"longer vile creatures! When they know that He is good, they love Him;"
1261,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"and, when they love Him, they are good themselves. O Henry! my husband"
1262,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"and king! the judgments of our Heavenly Father are righteous; on this,"
1263,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"surely, we must think alike."
1264,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1265,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ And what, then? Speak out; again I command thee, speak"
1266,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,plainly! thy tongue was not so torpid but this moment. Art ready? Must
1267,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,I wait?
1268,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1269,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ If any doubt remains upon your royal mind of your equity in
1270,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,this business: should it haply seem possible to you that passion or
1271,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"prejudice, in yourself or another, may have warped so strong an"
1272,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,understanding--do but supplicate the Almighty to strengthen and
1273,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"enlighten it, and He will hear you."
1274,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1275,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ What! thou wouldst fain change thy quarters, ay?"
1276,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1277,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ My spirit is detached and ready, and I shall change them"
1278,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"shortly, whatever your Highness may determine."
1279,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1280,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ Yet thou appearest hale and resolute, and (they tell me)"
1281,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,smirkest and smilest to everybody.
1282,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1283,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ The withered leaf catches the sun sometimes, little as it can"
1284,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,profit by it; and I have heard stories of the breeze in other climates
1285,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"that sets in when daylight is about to close, and how constant it is,"
1286,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"and how refreshing. My heart, indeed, is now sustained strangely; it"
1287,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"became the more sensibly so from that time forward, when power and"
1288,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,grandeur and all things terrestrial were sunk from sight. Every act of
1289,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"kindness in those about me gives me satisfaction and pleasure, such as"
1290,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,I did not feel formerly. I was worse before God chastened me; yet I
1291,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,was never an ingrate. What pains have I taken to find out the
1292,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,village-girls who placed their posies in my chamber ere I arose in the
1293,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,morning! How gladly would I have recompensed the forester who lit up a
1294,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"brake on my birthnight, which else had warmed him half the winter! But"
1295,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,these are times past: I was not Queen of England.
1296,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1297,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ Nor adulterous, nor heretical."
1298,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1299,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ God be praised!
1300,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1301,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ Learned saint! thou knowest nothing of the lighter, but"
1302,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"perhaps canst inform me about the graver, of them."
1303,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1304,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ Which may it be, my liege?"
1305,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1306,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ Which may it be? Pestilence! I marvel that the walls of this
1307,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,tower do not crack around thee at such impiety.
1308,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1309,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Anne._ I would be instructed by the wisest of theologians: such is
1310,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,your Highness.
1311,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1312,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ Are the sins of the body, foul as they are, comparable to"
1313,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,those of the soul?
1314,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1315,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ When they are united, they must be worse."
1316,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1317,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Henry._ Go on, go on: thou pushest thy own breast against the sword."
1318,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,God hath deprived thee of thy reason for thy punishment. I must hear
1319,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"more: proceed, I charge thee."
1320,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1321,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ An aptitude to believe one thing rather than another, from"
1322,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"ignorance or weakness, or from the more persuasive manner of the"
1323,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"teacher, or from his purity of life, or from the strong impression of"
1324,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"a particular text at a particular time, and various things beside, may"
1325,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"influence and decide our opinion; and the hand of the Almighty, let us"
1326,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"hope, will fall gently on human fallibility."
1327,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1328,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,_Henry._ Opinion in matters of faith! rare wisdom! rare religion!
1329,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"Troth, Anne! thou hast well sobered me. I came rather warmly and"
1330,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"lovingly; but these light ringlets, by the holy rood, shall not shade"
1331,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"this shoulder much longer. Nay, do not start; I tap it for the last"
1332,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"time, my sweetest. If the Church permitted it, thou shouldst set forth"
1333,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"on thy long journey with the Eucharist between thy teeth, however"
1334,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,loath.
1335,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1336,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"_Anne._ Love your Elizabeth, my honoured lord, and God bless you! She"
1337,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,will soon forget to call me. Do not chide her: think how young she is.
1338,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1339,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,"Could I, could I kiss her, but once again! it would comfort my"
1340,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,heart--or break it.
1341,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1342,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1343,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1344,HENRY VIII AND ANNE BOLEYN,
1345,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE
1346,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1347,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1348,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Montaigne._ What could have brought you, M. de l'Escale, to visit the"
1349,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"old man of the mountain, other than a good heart? Oh, how delighted"
1350,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,and charmed I am to hear you speak such excellent Gascon. You rise
1351,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"early, I see: you must have risen with the sun, to be here at this"
1352,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,hour; it is a stout half-hour's walk from the brook. I have capital
1353,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"white wine, and the best cheese in Auvergne. You saw the goats and"
1354,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,the two cows before the castle.
1355,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1356,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"Pierre, thou hast done well: set it upon the table, and tell Master"
1357,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"Matthew to split a couple of chickens and broil them, and to pepper"
1358,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"but one. Do you like pepper, M. de l'Escale?"
1359,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1360,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Scaliger._ Not much.
1361,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1362,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Montaigne._ Hold hard! let the pepper alone: I hate it. Tell him to
1363,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"broil plenty of ham; only two slices at a time, upon his salvation."
1364,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1365,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ This, I perceive, is the antechamber to your library: here"
1366,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,are your everyday books.
1367,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1368,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Montaigne._ Faith! I have no other. These are plenty, methinks; is"
1369,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,not that your opinion?
1370,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1371,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ You have great resources within yourself, and therefore"
1372,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,can do with fewer.
1373,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1374,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Montaigne._ Why, how many now do you think here may be?"
1375,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1376,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Scaliger._ I did not believe at first that there could be above
1377,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,fourscore.
1378,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1379,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Montaigne._ Well! are fourscore few?--are we talking of peas and
1380,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,beans?
1381,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1382,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Scaliger._ I and my father (put together) have written well-nigh as
1383,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,many.
1384,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1385,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Montaigne._ Ah! to write them is quite another thing: but one reads
1386,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"books without a spur, or even a pat from our Lady Vanity. How do you"
1387,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,like my wine?--it comes from the little knoll yonder: you cannot see
1388,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"the vines, those chestnut-trees are between."
1389,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1390,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ The wine is excellent; light, odoriferous, with a"
1391,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,smartness like a sharp child's prattle.
1392,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1393,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Montaigne._ It never goes to the head, nor pulls the nerves, which"
1394,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,many do as if they were guitar-strings. I drink a couple of bottles a
1395,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"day, winter and summer, and never am the worse for it. You gentlemen"
1396,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"of the Agennois have better in your province, and indeed the very best"
1397,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,under the sun. I do not wonder that the Parliament of Bordeaux should
1398,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"be jealous of their privileges, and call it Bordeaux. Now, if you"
1399,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"prefer your own country wine, only say it: I have several bottles in"
1400,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"my cellar, with corks as long as rapiers, and as polished. I do not"
1401,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"know, M. de l'Escale, whether you are particular in these matters: not"
1402,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"quite, I should imagine, so great a judge in them as in others?"
1403,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1404,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ I know three things: wine, poetry, and the world."
1405,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1406,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Montaigne._ You know one too many, then. I hardly know whether I know"
1407,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,anything about poetry; for I like Clem Marot better than Ronsard.
1408,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"Ronsard is so plaguily stiff and stately, where there is no occasion"
1409,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,for it; I verily do think the man must have slept with his wife in a
1410,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,cuirass.
1411,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1412,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Scaliger._ It pleases me greatly that you like Marot. His versions of
1413,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"the Psalms is lately set to music, and added to the New Testament of"
1414,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,Geneva.
1415,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1416,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Montaigne._ It is putting a slice of honeycomb into a barrel of
1417,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"vinegar, which will never grow the sweeter for it."
1418,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1419,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ Surely, you do not think in this fashion of the New"
1420,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,Testament!
1421,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1422,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Montaigne._ Who supposes it? Whatever is mild and kindly is there.
1423,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"But Jack Calvin has thrown bird-lime and vitriol upon it, and whoever"
1424,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,but touches the cover dirties his fingers or burns them.
1425,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1426,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ Calvin is a very great man, I do assure you, M. de"
1427,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,Montaigne.
1428,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1429,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Montaigne._ I do not like your great men who beckon me to them, call"
1430,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"me their begotten, their dear child, and their entrails; and, if I"
1431,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"happen to say on any occasion, 'I beg leave, sir, to dissent a little"
1432,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"from you,' stamp and cry, 'The devil you do!' and whistle to the"
1433,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,executioner.
1434,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1435,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ You exaggerate, my worthy friend!"
1436,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1437,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Montaigne._ Exaggerate do I, M. de l'Escale? What was it he did the"
1438,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"other day to the poor devil there with an odd name?--Melancthon, I"
1439,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,think it is.
1440,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1441,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Scaliger._ I do not know: I have received no intelligence of late
1442,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,from Geneva.
1443,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1444,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Montaigne._ It was but last night that our curate rode over from
1445,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"Lyons (he made two days of it, as you may suppose) and supped with me."
1446,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,He told me that Jack had got his old friend hanged and burned. I could
1447,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"not join him in the joke, for I find none such in the New Testament,"
1448,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"on which he would have founded it; and, if it is one, it is not in my"
1449,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,manner or to my taste.
1450,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1451,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ I cannot well believe the report, my dear sir. He was"
1452,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"rather urgent, indeed, on the combustion of the heretic Michael"
1453,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,Servetus some years past.
1454,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1455,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Montaigne._ A thousand to one, my spiritual guide mistook the name."
1456,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"He has heard of both, I warrant him, and thinks in his conscience that"
1457,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,either is as good a roast as the other.
1458,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1459,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ Theologians are proud and intolerant, and truly the"
1460,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"farthest of all men from theology, if theology means the rational"
1461,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"sense of religion, or indeed has anything to do with it in any way."
1462,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"Melancthon was the very best of the reformers; quiet, sedate,"
1463,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"charitable, intrepid, firm in friendship, ardent in faith, acute in"
1464,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"argument, and profound in learning."
1465,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1466,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Montaigne._ Who cares about his argumentation or his learning, if he"
1467,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,was the rest?
1468,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1469,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Scaliger._ I hope you will suspend your judgment on this affair until
1470,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,you receive some more certain and positive information.
1471,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1472,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Montaigne._ I can believe it of the Sieur Calvin.
1473,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1474,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ I cannot. John Calvin is a grave man, orderly and"
1475,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,reasonable.
1476,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1477,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Montaigne._ In my opinion he has not the order nor the reason of my
1478,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"cook. Mat never took a man for a sucking-pig, cleaning and scraping"
1479,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,and buttering and roasting him; nor ever twitched God by the sleeve
1480,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,and swore He should not have His own way.
1481,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1482,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ M. de Montaigne, have you ever studied the doctrine of"
1483,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,predestination?
1484,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1485,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Montaigne._ I should not understand it, if I had; and I would not"
1486,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,break through an old fence merely to get into a cavern. I would not
1487,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"give a fig or a fig-leaf to know the truth of it, as far as any man"
1488,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"can teach it me. Would it make me honester or happier, or, in other"
1489,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"things, wiser?"
1490,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1491,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Scaliger._ I do not know whether it would materially.
1492,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1493,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Montaigne._ I should be an egregious fool then to care about it. Our
1494,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,disputes on controverted points have filled the country with
1495,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,missionaries and cut-throats. Both parties have shown a disposition to
1496,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,turn this comfortable old house of mine into a fortress. If I had
1497,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"inclined to either, the other would have done it. Come walk about it"
1498,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"with me; after a ride, you can do nothing better to take off fatigue."
1499,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1500,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Scaliger._ A most spacious kitchen!
1501,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1502,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Montaigne._ Look up!
1503,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1504,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Scaliger._ You have twenty or more flitches of bacon hanging there.
1505,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1506,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Montaigne._ And if I had been a doctor or a captain, I should have"
1507,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,had a cobweb and predestination in the place of them. Your soldiers of
1508,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"the _religion_ on the one side, and of the _good old faith_ on the"
1509,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"other, would not have left unto me safe and sound even that good old"
1510,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,woman there.
1511,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1512,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ Oh, yes! they would, I hope."
1513,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1514,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Old Woman._ Why dost giggle, Mat? What should he know about the"
1515,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"business? He speaks mighty bad French, and is as spiteful as the"
1516,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"devil. Praised be God, we have a kind master, who thinks about us, and"
1517,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,feels for us.
1518,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1519,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ Upon my word, M. de Montaigne, this gallery is an"
1520,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,interesting one.
1521,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1522,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Montaigne._ I can show you nothing but my house and my dairy. We have
1523,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"no chase in the month of May, you know--unless you would like to bait"
1524,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,the badger in the stable. This is rare sport in rainy days.
1525,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1526,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ Are you in earnest, M. de Montaigne?"
1527,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1528,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Montaigne._ No, no, no, I cannot afford to worry him outright: only a"
1529,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,little for pastime--a morning's merriment for the dogs and wenches.
1530,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1531,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ You really are then of so happy a temperament that, at"
1532,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"your time of life, you can be amused by baiting a badger!"
1533,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1534,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Montaigne._ Why not? Your father, a wiser and graver and older man"
1535,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"than I am, was amused by baiting a professor or critic. I have not a"
1536,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,dog in the kennel that would treat the badger worse than brave Julius
1537,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"treated Cardan and Erasmus, and some dozens more. We are all childish,"
1538,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"old as well as young; and our very last tooth would fain stick, M. de"
1539,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"l'Escale, in some tender place of a neighbour. Boys laugh at a person"
1540,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"who falls in the dirt; men laugh rather when they make him fall, and"
1541,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,most when the dirt is of their own laying.
1542,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1543,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"Is not the gallery rather cold, after the kitchen? We must go through"
1544,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,it to get into the court where I keep my tame rabbits; the stable is
1545,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"hard by: come along, come along."
1546,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1547,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Scaliger._ Permit me to look a little at those banners. Some of them
1548,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,are old indeed.
1549,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1550,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Montaigne._ Upon my word, I blush to think I never took notice how"
1551,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"they are tattered. I have no fewer than three women in the house, and"
1552,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"in a summer's evening, only two hours long, the worst of these rags"
1553,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,might have been darned across.
1554,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1555,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Scaliger._ You would not have done it surely!
1556,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1557,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Montaigne._ I am not over-thrifty; the women might have been better
1558,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,employed. It is as well as it is then; ay?
1559,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1560,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Scaliger._ I think so.
1561,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1562,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Montaigne._ So be it.
1563,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1564,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"_Scaliger._ They remind me of my own family, we being descended from"
1565,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"the great Cane della Scala, Prince of Verona, and from the House of"
1566,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"Hapsburg, as you must have heard from my father."
1567,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1568,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,_Montaigne._ What signifies it to the world whether the great Cane was
1569,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"tied to his grandmother or not? As for the House of Hapsburg, if you"
1570,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,could put together as many such houses as would make up a city larger
1571,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,"than Cairo, they would not be worth his study, or a sheet of paper on"
1572,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,the table of it.
1573,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1574,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1575,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1576,JOSEPH SCALIGER AND MONTAIGNE,
1577,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA
1578,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1579,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1580,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Boccaccio._ Remaining among us, I doubt not that you would soon"
1581,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,receive the same distinctions in your native country as others have
1582,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"conferred upon you: indeed, in confidence I may promise it. For"
1583,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,greatly are the Florentines ashamed that the most elegant of their
1584,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"writers and the most independent of their citizens lives in exile, by"
1585,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"the injustice he had suffered in the detriment done to his property,"
1586,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,through the intemperate administration of their laws.
1587,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1588,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Petrarca._ Let them recall me soon and honourably: then perhaps I may
1589,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"assist them to remove their ignominy, which I carry about with me"
1590,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"wherever I go, and which is pointed out by my exotic laurel."
1591,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1592,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Boccaccio._ There is, and ever will be, in all countries and under"
1593,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"all governments, an ostracism for their greatest men."
1594,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1595,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Petrarca._ At present we will talk no more about it. To-morrow I
1596,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"pursue my journey towards Padua, where I am expected; where some few"
1597,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"value and esteem me, honest and learned and ingenious men; although"
1598,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"neither those Transpadane regions, nor whatever extends beyond them,"
1599,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,have yet produced an equal to Boccaccio.
1600,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1601,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Boccaccio._ Then, in the name of friendship, do not go thither!--form"
1602,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,such rather from your fellow-citizens. I love my equals heartily; and
1603,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"shall love them the better when I see them raised up here, from our"
1604,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"own mother earth, by you."
1605,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1606,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Petrarca._ Let us continue our walk.
1607,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1608,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Boccaccio._ If you have been delighted (and you say you have been) at
1609,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"seeing again, after so long an absence, the house and garden wherein I"
1610,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"have placed the relaters of my stories, as reported in the _Decameron_,"
1611,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"come a little way farther up the ascent, and we will pass through the"
1612,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,vineyard on the west of the villa. You will see presently another on
1613,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"the right, lying in its warm little garden close to the roadside, the"
1614,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"scene lately of somewhat that would have looked well, as illustration,"
1615,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,in the midst of your Latin reflections. It shows us that people the
1616,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,most serious and determined may act at last contrariwise to the line
1617,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,of conduct they have laid down.
1618,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1619,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Petrarca._ Relate it to me, Messer Giovanni; for you are able to give"
1620,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"reality the merits and charms of fiction, just as easily as you give"
1621,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"fiction the semblance, the stature, and the movement of reality."
1622,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1623,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Boccaccio._ I must here forgo such powers, if in good truth I possess"
1624,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,them.
1625,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1626,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Petrarca._ This long green alley, defended by box and cypresses, is"
1627,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"very pleasant. The smell of box, although not sweet, is more agreeable"
1628,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,to me than many that are: I cannot say from what resuscitation of
1629,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"early and tender feeling. The cypress, too, seems to strengthen the"
1630,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"nerves of the brain. Indeed, I delight in the odour of most trees and"
1631,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,plants.
1632,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1633,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,Will not that dog hurt us?--he comes closer.
1634,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1635,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Boccaccio._ Dog! thou hast the colours of a magpie and the tongue of
1636,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,one; prithee be quiet: art thou not ashamed?
1637,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1638,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Petrarca._ Verily he trots off, comforting his angry belly with his"
1639,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"plenteous tail, flattened and bestrewn under it. He looks back, going"
1640,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"on, and puffs out his upper lip without a bark."
1641,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1642,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Boccaccio._ These creatures are more accessible to temperate and just
1643,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"rebuke than the creatures of our species, usually angry with less"
1644,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"reason, and from no sense, as dogs are, of duty. Look into that white"
1645,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,arcade! Surely it was white the other day; and now I perceive it is
1646,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,still so: the setting sun tinges it with yellow.
1647,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1648,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Petrarca._ The house has nothing of either the rustic or the
1649,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"magnificent about it; nothing quite regular, nothing much varied. If"
1650,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"there is anything at all affecting, as I fear there is, in the story"
1651,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"you are about to tell me, I could wish the edifice itself bore"
1652,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,externally some little of the interesting that I might hereafter turn
1653,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"my mind toward it, looking out of the catastrophe, though not away"
1654,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,from it. But I do not even find the peculiar and uncostly decoration
1655,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"of our Tuscan villas: the central turret, round which the kite"
1656,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"perpetually circles in search of pigeons or smaller prey, borne"
1657,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"onward, like the Flemish skater, by effortless will in motionless"
1658,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,progression. The view of Fiesole must be lovely from that window; but
1659,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,I fancy to myself it loses the cascade under the single high arch of
1660,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,the Mugnone.
1661,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1662,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Boccaccio._ I think so. In this villa--come rather farther off: the
1663,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"inhabitants of it may hear us, if they should happen to be in the"
1664,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"arbour, as most people are at the present hour of day--in this villa,"
1665,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"Messer Francesco, lives Monna Tita Monalda, who tenderly loved Amadeo"
1666,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"degli Oricellari. She, however, was reserved and coy; and Father"
1667,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"Pietro de' Pucci, an enemy to the family of Amadeo, told her nevermore"
1668,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"to think of him, for that, just before he knew her, he had thrown his"
1669,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"arm round the neck of Nunciata Righi, his mother's maid, calling her"
1670,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"most immodestly a sweet creature, and of a whiteness that marble would"
1671,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,split with envy at.
1672,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1673,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"Monna Tita trembled and turned pale. 'Father, is the girl really so"
1674,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,very fair?' said she anxiously.
1675,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1676,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"'Madonna,' replied the father, 'after confession she is not much"
1677,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"amiss: white she is, with a certain tint of pink not belonging to her,"
1678,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,but coming over her as through the wing of an angel pleased at the
1679,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"holy function; and her breath is such, the very ear smells it: poor,"
1680,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"innocent, sinful soul! Hei! The wretch, Amadeo, would have endangered"
1681,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,her salvation.'
1682,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1683,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"'She must be a wicked girl to let him,' said Monna Tita. 'A young man"
1684,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,of good parentage and education would not dare to do such a thing of
1685,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"his own accord. I will see him no more, however. But it was before he"
1686,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,knew me: and it may not be true. I cannot think any young woman would
1687,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"let a young man do so, even in the last hour before Lent. Now in what"
1688,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,month was it supposed to be?'
1689,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1690,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,'Supposed to be!' cried the father indignantly: 'in June; I say in
1691,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,June.'
1692,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1693,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"'Oh! that now is quite impossible: for on the second of July,"
1694,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"forty-one days from this, and at this very hour of it, he swore to me"
1695,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,eternal love and constancy. I will inquire of him whether it is true:
1696,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,I will charge him with it.'
1697,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1698,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"She did. Amadeo confessed his fault, and, thinking it a venial one,"
1699,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,would have taken and kissed her hand as he asked forgiveness.
1700,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1701,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Petrarca._ Children! children! I will go into the house, and if their"
1702,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"relatives, as I suppose, have approved of the marriage, I will"
1703,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"endeavour to persuade the young lady that a fault like this, on the"
1704,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"repentance of her lover, is not unpardonable. But first, is Amadeo a"
1705,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,young man of loose habits?
1706,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1707,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Boccaccio._ Less than our others: in fact, I never heard of any"
1708,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"deviation, excepting this."
1709,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1710,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Petrarca._ Come, then, with me."
1711,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1712,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Boccaccio._ Wait a little.
1713,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1714,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Petrarca._ I hope the modest Tita, after a trial, will not be too"
1715,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,severe with him.
1716,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1717,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Boccaccio._ Severity is far from her nature; but, such is her purity"
1718,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"and innocence, she shed many and bitter tears at his confession, and"
1719,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,declared her unalterable determination of taking the veil among the
1720,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"nuns of Fiesole. Amadeo fell at her feet, and wept upon them. She"
1721,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"pushed him from her gently, and told him she would still love him if"
1722,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"he would follow her example, leave the world, and become a friar of"
1723,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"San Marco. Amadeo was speechless; and, if he had not been so, he never"
1724,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,would have made a promise he intended to violate. She retired from
1725,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"him. After a time he arose, less wounded than benumbed by the sharp"
1726,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"uncovered stones in the garden-walk; and, as a man who fears to fall"
1727,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"from a precipice goes farther from it than is necessary, so did Amadeo"
1728,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"shun the quarter where the gate is, and, oppressed by his agony and"
1729,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"despair, throw his arms across the sundial and rest his brow upon it,"
1730,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,hot as it must have been on a cloudless day in August. When the
1731,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"evening was about to close, he was aroused by the cries of rooks"
1732,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"overhead; they flew towards Florence, and beyond; he, too, went back"
1733,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,into the city.
1734,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1735,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,Tita fell sick from her inquietude. Every morning ere sunrise did
1736,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,Amadeo return; but could hear only from the labourers in the field
1737,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"that Monna Tita was ill, because she had promised to take the veil and"
1738,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"had not taken it, knowing, as she must do, that the heavenly"
1739,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"bridegroom is a bridegroom never to be trifled with, let the spouse be"
1740,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,young and beautiful as she may be. Amadeo had often conversed with the
1741,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"peasant of the farm, who much pitied so worthy and loving a gentleman;"
1742,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"and, finding him one evening fixing some thick and high stakes in the"
1743,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"ground, offered to help him. After due thanks, 'It is time,' said the"
1744,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"peasant, 'to rebuild the hovel and watch the grapes.'"
1745,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1746,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"'This is my house,' cried he. 'Could I never, in my stupidity, think"
1747,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,about rebuilding it before? Bring me another mat or two: I will sleep
1748,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"here to-night, to-morrow night, every night, all autumn, all winter.'"
1749,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1750,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"He slept there, and was consoled at last by hearing that Monna Tita"
1751,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"was out of danger, and recovering from her illness by spiritual means."
1752,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,His heart grew lighter day after day. Every evening did he observe the
1753,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"rooks, in the same order, pass along the same track in the heavens,"
1754,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"just over San Marco; and it now occurred to him, after three weeks,"
1755,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"indeed, that Monna Tita had perhaps some strange idea, in choosing his"
1756,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"monastery, not unconnected with the passage of these birds. He grew"
1757,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"calmer upon it, until he asked himself whether he might hope. In the"
1758,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"midst of this half-meditation, half-dream, his whole frame was shaken"
1759,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"by the voices, however low and gentle, of two monks, coming from the"
1760,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,villa and approaching him. He would have concealed himself under this
1761,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"bank whereon we are standing; but they saw him, and called him by"
1762,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"name. He now perceived that the younger of them was Guiberto Oddi,"
1763,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"with whom he had been at school about six or seven years ago, and who"
1764,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,admired him for his courage and frankness when he was almost a child.
1765,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1766,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"'Do not let us mortify poor Amadeo,' said Guiberto to his companion."
1767,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"'Return to the road: I will speak a few words to him, and engage him"
1768,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,(I trust) to comply with reason and yield to necessity.' The elder
1769,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"monk, who saw he should have to climb the hill again, assented to the"
1770,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"proposal, and went into the road. After the first embraces and few"
1771,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"words, 'Amadeo! Amadeo!' said Guiberto, 'it was love that made me a"
1772,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,friar; let anything else make you one.'
1773,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1774,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"'Kind heart!' replied Amadeo. 'If death or religion, or hatred of me,"
1775,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"deprives me of Tita Monalda, I will die, where she commanded me, in"
1776,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"the cowl. It is you who prepare her, then, to throw away her life and"
1777,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,mine!'
1778,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1779,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"'Hold! Amadeo!' said Guiberto, 'I officiate together with good Father"
1780,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"Fontesecco, who invariably falls asleep amid our holy function.'"
1781,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1782,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"Now, Messer Francesco, I must inform you that Father Fontesecco has"
1783,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"the heart of a flower. It feels nothing, it wants nothing; it is pure"
1784,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"and simple, and full of its own little light. Innocent as a child, as"
1785,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"an angel, nothing ever troubled him but how to devise what he should"
1786,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,confess. A confession costs him more trouble to invent than any
1787,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,Giornata in my _Decameron_ cost me. He was once overheard to say on
1788,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"this occasion, 'God forgive me in His infinite mercy, for making it"
1789,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,appear that I am a little worse than He has chosen I should be!' He is
1790,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,temperate; for he never drinks more than exactly half the wine and
1791,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"water set before him. In fact, he drinks the wine and leaves the"
1792,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"water, saying: 'We have the same water up at San Domenico; we send it"
1793,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"hither: it would be uncivil to take back our own gift, and still more"
1794,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,to leave a suspicion that we thought other people's wine poor
1795,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"beverage.' Being afflicted by the gravel, the physician of his convent"
1796,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"advised him, as he never was fond of wine, to leave it off entirely;"
1797,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"on which he said, 'I know few things; but this I know well--in water"
1798,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"there is often gravel, in wine never. It hath pleased God to afflict"
1799,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"me, and even to go a little out of His way in order to do it, for the"
1800,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"greater warning to other sinners. I will drink wine, brother"
1801,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"Anselmini, and help His work.'"
1802,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1803,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,I have led you away from the younger monk.
1804,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1805,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"'While Father Fontesecco is in the first stage of beatitude, chanting"
1806,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"through his nose the _Benedicite_, I will attempt,' said Guiberto, 'to"
1807,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,comfort Monna Tita.'
1808,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1809,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"'Good, blessed Guiberto!' exclaimed Amadeo in a transport of"
1810,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"gratitude, at which Guiberto smiled with his usual grace and suavity."
1811,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,'O Guiberto! Guiberto! my heart is breaking. Why should she want you
1812,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,to comfort her?--but--comfort her then!' and he covered his face
1813,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,within his hands.
1814,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1815,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"'Remember,' said Guiberto placidly, 'her uncle is bedridden; her aunt"
1816,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"never leaves him; the servants are old and sullen, and will stir for"
1817,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"nobody. Finding her resolved, as they believe, to become a nun, they"
1818,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"are little assiduous in their services. Humour her, if none else does,"
1819,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"Amadeo; let her fancy that you intend to be a friar; and, for the"
1820,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"present, walk not on these grounds.'"
1821,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1822,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"'Are you true, or are you traitorous?' cried Amadeo, grasping his"
1823,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,friend's hand most fiercely.
1824,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1825,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"'Follow your own counsel, if you think mine insincere,' said the young"
1826,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"friar, not withdrawing his hand, but placing the other on Amadeo's."
1827,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"'Let me, however, advise you to conceal yourself; and I will direct"
1828,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,Silvestrina to bring you such accounts of her mistress as may at least
1829,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,make you easy in regard to her health. Adieu.'
1830,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1831,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"Amadeo was now rather tranquil; more than he had ever been, not only"
1832,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"since the displeasure of Monna Tita, but since the first sight of her."
1833,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"Profuse at all times in his gratitude to Silvestrina, whenever she"
1834,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"brought him good news, news better than usual, he pressed her to his"
1835,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"bosom. Silvestrina Pioppi is about fifteen, slender, fresh,"
1836,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"intelligent, lively, good-humoured, sensitive; and any one but Amadeo"
1837,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,might call her very pretty.
1838,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1839,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Petrarca._ Ah, Giovanni! here I find your heart obtaining the mastery"
1840,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"over your vivid and volatile imagination. Well have you said, the"
1841,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"maiden being really pretty, any one but Amadeo might think her so. On"
1842,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,the banks of the Sorga there are beautiful maids; the woods and the
1843,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,rocks have a thousand times repeated it. I heard but one echo; I heard
1844,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,but one name: I would have fled from them for ever at another.
1845,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1846,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Boccaccio._ Francesco, do not beat your breast just now: wait a"
1847,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,little. Monna Tita would take the veil. The fatal certainty was
1848,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"announced to Amadeo by his true Guiberto, who had earnestly and"
1849,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,repeatedly prayed her to consider the thing a few months longer.
1850,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1851,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,'I will see her first! By all the saints of heaven I will see her!'
1852,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"cried the desperate Amadeo, and ran into the house, toward the still"
1853,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,apartment of his beloved. Fortunately Guiberto was neither less active
1854,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"nor less strong than he, and overtaking him at the moment, drew him"
1855,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"into the room opposite. 'If you will be quiet and reasonable, there is"
1856,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"yet a possibility left you,' said Guiberto in his ear, although"
1857,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,perhaps he did not think it. 'But if you utter a voice or are seen by
1858,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"any one, you ruin the fame of her you love, and obstruct your own"
1859,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,prospects for ever. It being known that you have not slept in Florence
1860,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"these several nights, it will be suspected by the malicious that you"
1861,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,have slept in the villa with the connivance of Monna Tita. Compose
1862,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,yourself; answer nothing; rest where you are: do not add a worse
1863,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"imprudence to a very bad one. I promise you my assistance, my speedy"
1864,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"return, and best counsel: you shall be released at daybreak.' He"
1865,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,ordered Silvestrina to supply the unfortunate youth with the cordials
1866,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"usually administered to the uncle, or with the rich old wine they were"
1867,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,made of; and she performed the order with such promptitude and
1868,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"attention, that he was soon in some sort refreshed."
1869,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1870,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Petrarca._ I pity him from my innermost heart, poor young man! Alas,"
1871,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"we are none of us, by original sin, free from infirmities or from"
1872,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,vices.
1873,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1874,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Boccaccio._ If we could find a man exempt by nature from vices and
1875,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"infirmities, we should find one not worth knowing: he would also be"
1876,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,void of tenderness and compassion. What allowances then could his best
1877,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"friends expect from him in their frailties? What help, consolation,"
1878,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,and assistance in their misfortunes? We are in the midst of a workshop
1879,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"well stored with sharp instruments: we may do ill with many, unless we"
1880,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"take heed; and good with all, if we will but learn how to employ them."
1881,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1882,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Petrarca._ There is somewhat of reason in this. You strengthen me to
1883,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,proceed with you: I can bear the rest.
1884,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1885,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Boccaccio._ Guiberto had taken leave of his friend, and had advanced"
1886,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"a quarter of a mile, which (as you perceive) is nearly the whole way,"
1887,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"on his return to the monastery, when he was overtaken by some peasants"
1888,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,who were hastening homeward from Florence. The information he
1889,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,collected from them made him determine to retrace his steps. He
1890,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"entered the room again, and, from the intelligence he had just"
1891,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"acquired, gave Amadeo the assurance that Monna Tita must delay her"
1892,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,entrance into the convent; for that the abbess had that moment gone
1893,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"down the hill on her way toward Siena to venerate some holy relics,"
1894,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"carrying with her three candles, each five feet long, to burn before"
1895,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,them; which candles contained many particles of the myrrh presented at
1896,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,the Nativity of our Saviour by the Wise Men of the East. Amadeo
1897,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"breathed freely, and was persuaded by Guiberto to take another cup of"
1898,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"old wine, and to eat with him some cold roast kid, which had been"
1899,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,offered him for _merenda_. After the agitation of his mind a heavy
1900,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"sleep fell upon the lover, coming almost before Guiberto departed: so"
1901,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,heavy indeed that Silvestrina was alarmed. It was her apartment; and
1902,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,she performed the honours of it as well as any lady in Florence could
1903,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,have done.
1904,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1905,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Petrarca._ I easily believe it: the poor are more attentive than the
1906,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"rich, and the young are more compassionate than the old."
1907,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1908,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Boccaccio._ O Francesco! what inconsistent creatures are we!
1909,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1910,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Petrarca._ True, indeed! I now foresee the end. He might have done"
1911,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,worse.
1912,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1913,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Boccaccio._ I think so.
1914,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1915,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Petrarca._ He almost deserved it.
1916,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1917,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Boccaccio._ I think that too.
1918,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1919,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Petrarca._ Wretched mortals! our passions for ever lead us into this,"
1920,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,or worse.
1921,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1922,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Boccaccio._ Ay, truly; much worse generally."
1923,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1924,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Petrarca._ The very twig on which the flowers grew lately scourges us
1925,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,to the bone in its maturity.
1926,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1927,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Boccaccio._ Incredible will it be to you, and, by my faith, to me it"
1928,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"was hardly credible. Certain, however, is it that Guiberto on his"
1929,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,return by sunrise found Amadeo in the arms of sleep.
1930,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1931,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Petrarca._ Not at all, not at all: the truest lover might suffer and"
1932,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,act as he did.
1933,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1934,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Boccaccio._ But, Francesco, there was another pair of arms about him,"
1935,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"worth twenty such, divinity as he is. A loud burst of laughter from"
1936,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,Guiberto did not arouse either of the parties; but Monna Tita heard
1937,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"it, and rushed into the room, tearing her hair, and invoking the"
1938,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,saints of heaven against the perfidy of man. She seized Silvestrina by
1939,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"that arm which appeared the most offending: the girl opened her eyes,"
1940,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"turned on her face, rolled out of bed, and threw herself at the feet"
1941,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"of her mistress, shedding tears, and wiping them away with the only"
1942,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,piece of linen about her. Monna Tita too shed tears. Amadeo still
1943,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"slept profoundly; a flush, almost of crimson, overspreading his"
1944,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"cheeks. Monna Tita led away, after some pause, poor Silvestrina, and"
1945,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"made her confess the whole. She then wept more and more, and made the"
1946,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"girl confess it again, and explain her confession. 'I cannot believe"
1947,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"such wickedness,' she cried: 'he could not be so hardened. O sinful"
1948,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"Silvestrina! how will you ever tell Father Doni one half, one quarter?"
1949,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,He never can absolve you.'
1950,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1951,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Petrarca._ Giovanni, I am glad I did not enter the house; you were"
1952,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,prudent in restraining me. I have no pity for the youth at all: never
1953,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,did one so deserve to lose a mistress.
1954,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1955,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Boccaccio._ Say, rather, to gain a wife."
1956,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1957,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Petrarca._ Absurdity! impossibility!
1958,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1959,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"_Boccaccio._ He won her fairly; strangely, and on a strange table, as"
1960,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,he played his game. Listen! that guitar is Monna Tita's. Listen! what
1961,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,a fine voice (do not you think it?) is Amadeo's.
1962,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1963,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Amadeo._ [_Singing._]
1964,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1965,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"Oh, I have err'd!"
1966,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,I laid my hand upon the nest
1967,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,"(Tita, I sigh to sing the rest)"
1968,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,Of the wrong bird.
1969,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1970,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,_Petrarca._ She laughs too at it! Ah! Monna Tita was made by nature to
1971,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,live on this side of Fiesole.
1972,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1973,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1974,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1975,BOCCACCIO AND PETRARCA,
1976,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES
1977,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
1978,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
1979,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ Mademoiselle, it is the king's desire that I compliment you"
1980,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,on the elevation you have attained.
1981,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
1982,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ O monseigneur, I know very well what you mean. His"
1983,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,Majesty is kind and polite to everybody. The last thing he said to me
1984,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"was, 'Ang√©lique! do not forget to compliment Monseigneur the bishop on"
1985,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"the dignity I have conferred upon him, of almoner to the dauphiness. I"
1986,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,desired the appointment for him only that he might be of rank
1987,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"sufficient to confess, now you are duchess. Let him be your confessor,"
1988,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,my little girl.'
1989,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
1990,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ I dare not presume to ask you, mademoiselle, what was your"
1991,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,gracious reply to the condescension of our royal master.
1992,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
1993,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ Oh, yes! you may. I told him I was almost sure I should"
1994,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"be ashamed of confessing such naughty things to a person of high rank,"
1995,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,who writes like an angel.
1996,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
1997,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ The observation was inspired, mademoiselle, by your"
1998,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,goodness and modesty.
1999,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2000,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ You are so agreeable a man, monseigneur, I will confess"
2001,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"to you, directly, if you like."
2002,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2003,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ Have you brought yourself to a proper frame of mind, young"
2004,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,lady?
2005,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2006,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Fontanges._ What is that?
2007,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2008,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Bossuet._ Do you hate sin?
2009,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2010,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Fontanges._ Very much.
2011,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2012,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Bossuet._ Are you resolved to leave it off?
2013,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2014,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Fontanges._ I have left it off entirely since the king began to love
2015,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,me. I have never said a spiteful word of anybody since.
2016,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2017,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ In your opinion, mademoiselle, are there no other sins than"
2018,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,malice?
2019,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2020,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Fontanges._ I never stole anything; I never committed adultery; I
2021,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"never coveted my neighbour's wife; I never killed any person, though"
2022,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,several have told me they should die for me.
2023,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2024,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ Vain, idle talk! Did you listen to it?"
2025,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2026,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ Indeed I did, with both ears; it seemed so funny."
2027,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2028,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ You have something to answer for, then."
2029,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2030,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ No, indeed, I have not, monseigneur. I have asked many"
2031,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"times after them, and found they were all alive, which mortified me."
2032,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2033,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ So, then! you would really have them die for you?"
2034,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2035,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ Oh, no, no! but I wanted to see whether they were in"
2036,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"earnest, or told me fibs; for, if they told me fibs, I would never"
2037,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,trust them again.
2038,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2039,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ Do you hate the world, mademoiselle?"
2040,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2041,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ A good deal of it: all Picardy, for example, and all"
2042,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"Sologne; nothing is uglier--and, oh my life! what frightful men and"
2043,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,women!
2044,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2045,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ I would say, in plain language, do you hate the flesh and"
2046,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,the devil?
2047,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2048,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Fontanges._ Who does not hate the devil? If you will hold my hand the
2049,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"while, I will tell him so. I hate you, beast! There now. As for flesh,"
2050,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"I never could bear a fat man. Such people can neither dance nor hunt,"
2051,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,nor do anything that I know of.
2052,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2053,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ Mademoiselle Marie-Ang√©lique de Scoraille de Rousille,"
2054,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,Duchess de Fontanges! do you hate titles and dignities and yourself?
2055,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2056,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Fontanges._ Myself! does any one hate me? Why should I be the first?
2057,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,Hatred is the worst thing in the world: it makes one so very ugly.
2058,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2059,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ To love God, we must hate ourselves. We must detest our"
2060,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"bodies, if we would save our souls."
2061,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2062,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Fontanges._ That is hard: how can I do it? I see nothing so
2063,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,detestable in mine. Do you? To love is easier. I love God whenever I
2064,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"think of Him, He has been so very good to me; but I cannot hate"
2065,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"myself, if I would. As God hath not hated me, why should I? Beside, it"
2066,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,was He who made the king to love me; for I heard you say in a sermon
2067,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,that the hearts of kings are in His rule and governance. As for titles
2068,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"and dignities, I do not care much about them while his Majesty loves"
2069,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"me, and calls me his Ang√©lique. They make people more civil about us;"
2070,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"and therefore it must be a simpleton who hates or disregards them, and"
2071,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,a hypocrite who pretends it. I am glad to be a duchess. Manon and
2072,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"Lisette have never tied my garter so as to hurt me since, nor has the"
2073,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,mischievous old La Grange said anything cross or bold: on the
2074,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"contrary, she told me what a fine colour and what a plumpness it gave"
2075,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"me. Would not you rather be a duchess than a waiting-maid or a nun, if"
2076,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,the king gave you your choice?
2077,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2078,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ Pardon me, mademoiselle, I am confounded at the levity of"
2079,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,your question.
2080,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2081,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ I am in earnest, as you see."
2082,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2083,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Bossuet._ Flattery will come before you in other and more dangerous
2084,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,forms: you will be commended for excellences which do not belong to
2085,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,you; and this you will find as injurious to your repose as to your
2086,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,virtue. An ingenuous mind feels in unmerited praise the bitterest
2087,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"reproof. If you reject it, you are unhappy; if you accept it, you are"
2088,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,undone. The compliments of a king are of themselves sufficient to
2089,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,pervert your intellect.
2090,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2091,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Fontanges._ There you are mistaken twice over. It is not my person
2092,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"that pleases him so greatly: it is my spirit, my wit, my talents, my"
2093,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"genius, and that very thing which you have mentioned--what was it? my"
2094,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,intellect. He never complimented me the least upon my beauty. Others
2095,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,have said that I am the most beautiful young creature under heaven; a
2096,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"blossom of Paradise, a nymph, an angel; worth (let me whisper it in"
2097,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,your ear--do I lean too hard?) a thousand Montespans. But his Majesty
2098,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,never said more on the occasion than that I was _imparagonable!_ (what
2099,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,is that?) and that he adored me; holding my hand and sitting quite
2100,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"still, when he might have romped with me and kissed me."
2101,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2102,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Bossuet._ I would aspire to the glory of converting you.
2103,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2104,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Fontanges._ You may do anything with me but convert me: you must not
2105,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,do that; I am a Catholic born. M. de Turenne and Mademoiselle de Duras
2106,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,were heretics: you did right there. The king told the chancellor that
2107,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"he prepared them, that the business was arranged for you, and that you"
2108,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"had nothing to do but get ready the arguments and responses, which you"
2109,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,did gallantly--did not you? And yet Mademoiselle de Duras was very
2110,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"awkward for a long while afterwards in crossing herself, and was once"
2111,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,remarked to beat her breast in the litany with the points of two
2112,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"fingers at a time, when every one is taught to use only the second,"
2113,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,whether it has a ring upon it or not. I am sorry she did so; for
2114,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"people might think her insincere in her conversion, and pretend that"
2115,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,she kept a finger for each religion.
2116,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2117,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Bossuet._ It would be as uncharitable to doubt the conviction of
2118,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,Mademoiselle de Duras as that of M. le Mar√©chal.
2119,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2120,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ I have heard some fine verses, I can assure you,"
2121,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"monseigneur, in which you are called the conqueror of Turenne. I"
2122,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"should like to have been his conqueror myself, he was so great a man."
2123,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,I understand that you have lately done a much more difficult thing.
2124,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2125,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ To what do you refer, mademoiselle?"
2126,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2127,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ That you have overcome quietism. Now, in the name of"
2128,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"wonder, how could you manage that?"
2129,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2130,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Bossuet._ By the grace of God.
2131,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2132,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ Yes, indeed; but never until now did God give any"
2133,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,preacher so much of His grace as to subdue this pest.
2134,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2135,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Bossuet._ It has appeared among us but lately.
2136,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2137,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ Oh, dear me! I have always been subject to it dreadfully,"
2138,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,from a child.
2139,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2140,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Bossuet._ Really! I never heard so.
2141,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2142,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ I checked myself as well as I could, although they"
2143,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,constantly told me I looked well in it.
2144,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2145,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ In what, mademoiselle?"
2146,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2147,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ In quietism; that is, when I fell asleep at sermon time."
2148,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,I am ashamed that such a learned and pious man as M. de F√©nelon should
2149,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"incline to it,[1] as they say he does."
2150,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2151,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ Mademoiselle, you quite mistake the matter."
2152,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2153,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Fontanges._ Is not then M. de F√©nelon thought a very pious and
2154,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,learned person?
2155,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2156,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Bossuet._ And justly.
2157,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2158,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ I have read a great way in a romance he has begun, about"
2159,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,a knight-errant in search of a father. The king says there are many
2160,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,such about his court; but I never saw them nor heard of them before.
2161,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"The Marchioness de la Motte, his relative, brought it to me, written"
2162,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"out in a charming hand, as much as the copy-book would hold; and I got"
2163,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"through, I know not how far. If he had gone on with the nymphs in the"
2164,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"grotto, I never should have been tired of him; but he quite forgot his"
2165,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"own story, and left them at once; in a hurry (I suppose) to set out"
2166,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"upon his mission to Saintonge in the _pays de d'Aunis_, where the king"
2167,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"has promised him a famous _heretic hunt_. He is, I do assure you, a"
2168,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"wonderful creature: he understands so much Latin and Greek, and knows"
2169,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,all the tricks of the sorceresses. Yet you keep him under.
2170,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2171,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ Mademoiselle, if you really have anything to confess, and"
2172,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"if you desire that I should have the honour of absolving you, it would"
2173,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"be better to proceed in it, than to oppress me with unmerited eulogies"
2174,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,on my humble labours.
2175,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2176,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ You must first direct me, monseigneur: I have nothing"
2177,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,particular. The king assures me there is no harm whatever in his love
2178,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,toward me.
2179,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2180,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Bossuet._ That depends on your thoughts at the moment. If you
2181,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"abstract the mind from the body, and turn your heart toward Heaven----"
2182,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2183,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ O monseigneur, I always did so--every time but once--you"
2184,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"quite make me blush. Let us converse about something else, or I shall"
2185,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"grow too serious, just as you made me the other day at the funeral"
2186,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"sermon. And now let me tell you, my lord, you compose such pretty"
2187,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"funeral sermons, I hope I shall have the pleasure of hearing you"
2188,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,preach mine.
2189,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2190,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ Rather let us hope, mademoiselle, that the hour is yet far"
2191,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,distant when so melancholy a service will be performed for you. May he
2192,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,who is unborn be the sad announcer of your departure hence![2] May he
2193,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,indicate to those around him many virtues not perhaps yet full-blown
2194,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"in you, and point triumphantly to many faults and foibles checked by"
2195,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"you in their early growth, and lying dead on the open road, you shall"
2196,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"have left behind you! To me the painful duty will, I trust, be"
2197,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,spared: I am advanced in age; you are a child.
2198,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2199,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ Oh, no! I am seventeen."
2200,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2201,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Bossuet._ I should have supposed you younger by two years at least.
2202,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"But do you collect nothing from your own reflection, which raises so"
2203,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"many in my breast? You think it possible that I, aged as I am, may"
2204,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,preach a sermon at your funeral. We say that our days are few; and
2205,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"saying it, we say too much. Marie-Ang√©lique, we have but one: the past"
2206,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"are not ours, and who can promise us the future? This in which we live"
2207,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,is ours only while we live in it; the next moment may strike it off
2208,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,from us; the next sentence I would utter may be broken and fall
2209,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,between us.[3] The beauty that has made a thousand hearts to beat at
2210,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"one instant, at the succeeding has been without pulse and colour,"
2211,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"without admirer, friend, companion, follower. She by whose eyes the"
2212,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"march of victory shall have been directed, whose name shall have"
2213,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"animated armies at the extremities of the earth, drops into one of its"
2214,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,crevices and mingles with its dust. Duchess de Fontanges! think on
2215,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,this! Lady! so live as to think on it undisturbed!
2216,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2217,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Fontanges._ O God! I am quite alarmed. Do not talk thus gravely. It
2218,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,is in vain that you speak to me in so sweet a voice. I am frightened
2219,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"even at the rattle of the beads about my neck: take them off, and let"
2220,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,us talk on other things. What was it that dropped on the floor as you
2221,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"were speaking? It seemed to shake the room, though it sounded like a"
2222,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,pin or button.
2223,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2224,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Bossuet._ Leave it there!
2225,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2226,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ Your ring fell from your hand, my lord bishop! How quick"
2227,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,you are! Could not you have trusted me to pick it up?
2228,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2229,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ Madame is too condescending: had this happened, I should"
2230,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,have been overwhelmed with confusion. My hand is shrivelled: the ring
2231,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,has ceased to fit it. A mere accident may draw us into perdition; a
2232,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,mere accident may bestow on us the means of grace. A pebble has moved
2233,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,you more than my words.
2234,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2235,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,_Fontanges._ It pleases me vastly: I admire rubies. I will ask the
2236,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,king for one exactly like it. This is the time he usually comes from
2237,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,the chase. I am sorry you cannot be present to hear how prettily I
2238,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"shall ask him: but that is impossible, you know; for I shall do it"
2239,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,just when I am certain he would give me anything. He said so himself:
2240,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,he said but yesterday--
2241,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2242,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,'Such a sweet creature is worth a world':
2243,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2244,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,and no actor on the stage was more like a king than his Majesty was
2245,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"when he spoke it, if he had but kept his wig and robe on. And yet you"
2246,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,know he is rather stiff and wrinkled for so great a monarch; and his
2247,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"eyes, I am afraid, are beginning to fail him, he looks so close at"
2248,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,things.
2249,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2250,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Bossuet._ Mademoiselle, such is the duty of a prince who desires to"
2251,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,conciliate our regard and love.
2252,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,
2253,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"_Fontanges._ Well, I think so, too, though I did not like it in him at"
2254,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,"first. I am sure he will order the ring for me, and I will confess to"
2255,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,you with it upon my finger. But first I must be cautious and
2256,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,particular to know of him how much it is his royal will that I should
2257,BOSSUET AND THE DUCHESS DE FONTANGES,say.

2289,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,suspected of aiming at the crown in the beginning of

2294,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2295,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Joanna._ How is this, my cousin, that you are besieged in your own"

2297,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2298,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Gaunt._ If their idol, madam, I am one which they may tread on as"

2304,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,Let me conduct you some paces hence.
2305,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2306,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,_Joanna._ I will speak to those below in the street. Quit my hand:
2307,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,they shall obey me.
2308,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2309,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Gaunt._ If you intend to order my death, madam, your guards who have"
2310,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"entered my court, and whose spurs and halberts I hear upon the"
2311,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"staircase, may overpower my domestics; and, seeing no such escape as"

2313,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"your feet! Some formalities, I trust, will be used in the proceedings"
2314,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"against me. Entitle me, in my attainder, not John of Gaunt, not Duke"
2315,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"of Lancaster, not King of Castile; nor commemorate my father, the most"
2316,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"glorious of princes, the vanquisher and pardoner of the most powerful;"
2317,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"nor style me, what those who loved or who flattered me did when I was"

2321,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"Crecy, of Poitiers, and Najera. Edward was my brother when he was but"
2322,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,your cousin; and the edge of my shield has clinked on his in many a

2324,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2325,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Joanna._ Attainder! God avert it! Duke of Lancaster, what dark"
2326,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"thought--alas! that the Regency should have known it! I came hither,"
2327,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"sir, for no such purpose as to ensnare or incriminate or alarm you."
2328,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2329,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,These weeds might surely have protected me from the fresh tears you
2330,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,have drawn forth.
2331,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2332,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Gaunt._ Sister, be comforted! this visor, too, has felt them."
2333,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2334,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,_Joanna._ O my Edward! my own so lately! Thy memory--thy beloved
2335,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"image--which never hath abandoned me, makes me bold: I dare not say"
2336,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,'generous'; for in saying it I should cease to be so--and who could be
2337,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,called generous by the side of thee? I will rescue from perdition the
2338,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,enemy of my son.
2339,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2340,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"Cousin, you loved your brother. Love, then, what was dearer to him"

2342,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"The father, who foiled so many, hath left no enemies; the innocent"
2343,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"child, who can injure no one, finds them!"
2344,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2345,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,Why have you unlaced and laid aside your visor? Do not expose your
2346,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"body to those missiles. Hold your shield before yourself, and step"
2347,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,aside. I need it not. I am resolved----
2348,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2349,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Gaunt._ On what, my cousin? Speak, and, by the saints! it shall be"

2351,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2352,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,_Joanna._ Heavens! who could have hurled those masses of stone from
2353,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,below? they stunned me. Did they descend all of them together; or did
2354,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,they split into fragments on hitting the pavement?
2355,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2356,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Gaunt._ Truly, I was not looking that way: they came, I must believe,"
2357,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,while you were speaking.
2358,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2359,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Joanna._ Aside, aside! further back! disregard _me_! Look! that last"
2360,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,arrow sticks half its head deep in the wainscot. It shook so violently
2361,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,I did not see the feather at first.
2362,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2363,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"No, no, Lancaster! I will not permit it. Take your shield up again;"
2364,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,and keep it all before you. Now step aside: I am resolved to prove
2365,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,whether the people will hear me.
2366,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2367,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Gaunt._ Then, madam, by your leave----"
2368,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2369,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,_Joanna._ Hold!
2370,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2371,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,_Gaunt._ Villains! take back to your kitchens those spits and skewers
2372,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"that you, forsooth, would fain call swords and arrows; and keep your"
2373,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,bricks and stones for your graves!
2374,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2375,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,_Joanna._ Imprudent man! who can save you? I shall be frightened: I
2376,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,must speak at once.
2377,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2378,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"O good kind people! ye who so greatly loved me, when I am sure I had"
2379,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"done nothing to deserve it, have I (unhappy me!) no merit with you"
2380,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"now, when I would assuage your anger, protect your fair fame, and send"
2381,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"you home contented with yourselves and me? Who is he, worthy citizens,"
2382,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,whom ye would drag to slaughter?
2383,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2384,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"True, indeed, he did revile someone. Neither I nor you can say"
2385,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"whom--some feaster and rioter, it seems, who had little right (he"
2386,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"thought) to carry sword or bow, and who, to show it, hath slunk away."
2387,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"And then another raised his anger: he was indignant that, under his"
2388,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"roof, a woman should be exposed to stoning. Which of you would not be"
2389,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,as choleric in a like affront? In the house of which among you should
2390,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,I not be protected as resolutely?
2391,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2392,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"No, no: I never can believe those angry cries. Let none ever tell me"
2393,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"again he is the enemy of my son, of his king, your darling child,"
2394,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,Richard. Are your fears more lively than a poor weak female's? than a
2395,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"mother's? yours, whom he hath so often led to victory, and praised to"
2396,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"his father, naming each--he, John of Gaunt, the defender of the"
2397,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"helpless, the comforter of the desolate, the rallying signal of the"
2398,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,desperately brave!
2399,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2400,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"Retire, Duke of Lancaster! This is no time----"
2401,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2402,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Gaunt._ Madam, I obey; but not through terror of that puddle at the"
2403,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"house door, which my handful of dust would dry up. Deign to command"
2404,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,me!
2405,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2406,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Joanna._ In the name of my son, then, retire!"
2407,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2408,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,_Gaunt._ Angelic goodness! I must fairly win it.
2409,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2410,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,_Joanna._ I think I know his voice that crieth out: 'Who will answer
2411,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"for him?' An honest and loyal man's, one who would counsel and save me"
2412,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"in any difficulty and danger. With what pleasure and satisfaction,"
2413,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"with what perfect joy and confidence, do I answer our right-trusty and"
2414,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,well-judging friend!
2415,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2416,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"'Let Lancaster bring his sureties,' say you, 'and we separate.' A"
2417,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"moment yet before we separate; if I might delay you so long, to"
2418,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"receive your sanction of those securities: for, in such grave matters,"
2419,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"it would ill become us to be over-hasty. I could bring fifty, I could"
2420,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"bring a hundred, not from among soldiers, not from among courtiers;"
2421,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"but selected from yourselves, were it equitable and fair to show such"
2422,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"partialities, or decorous in the parent and guardian of a king to"
2423,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,offer any other than herself.
2424,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2425,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"Raised by the hand of the Almighty from amidst you, but still one of"
2426,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"you, if the mother of a family is a part of it, here I stand surety"
2427,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"for John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, for his loyalty and allegiance."
2428,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2429,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Gaunt._ [_Running back toward Joanna._] Are the rioters, then,"
2430,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,bursting into the chamber through the windows?
2431,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2432,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,_Joanna._ The windows and doors of this solid edifice rattled and
2433,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,shook at the people's acclamation. My word is given for you: this was
2434,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,theirs in return. Lancaster! what a voice have the people when they
2435,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"speak out! It shakes me with astonishment, almost with consternation,"
2436,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,while it establishes the throne: what must it be when it is lifted up
2437,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,in vengeance!
2438,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2439,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,_Gaunt._ Wind; vapour----
2440,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2441,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,_Joanna._ Which none can wield nor hold. Need I say this to my cousin
2442,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,of Lancaster?
2443,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2444,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Gaunt._ Rather say, madam, that there is always one star above which"
2445,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,can tranquillize and control them.
2446,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2447,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Joanna._ Go, cousin! another time more sincerity!"
2448,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2449,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,_Gaunt._ You have this day saved my life from the people; for I now
2450,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"see my danger better, when it is no longer close before me. My Christ!"
2451,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,if ever I forget----
2452,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2453,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,_Joanna._ Swear not: every man in England hath sworn what you would
2454,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"swear. But if you abandon my Richard, my brave and beautiful child,"
2455,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"may--Oh! I could never curse, nor wish an evil; but, if you desert him"
2456,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"in the hour of need, you will think of those who have not deserted"
2457,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"you, and your own great heart will lie heavy on you, Lancaster!"
2458,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2459,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"Am I graver than I ought to be, that you look dejected? Come, then,"
2460,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"gentle cousin, lead me to my horse, and accompany me home. Richard"
2461,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,will embrace us tenderly. Every one is dear to every other upon rising
2462,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"out fresh from peril; affectionately then will he look, sweet boy,"
2463,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,upon his mother and his uncle! Never mind how many questions he may
2464,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"ask you, nor how strange ones. His only displeasure, if he has any,"
2465,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,will be that he stood not against the rioters or among them.
2466,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2467,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"_Gaunt._ Older than he have been as fond of mischief, and as fickle in"
2468,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,the choice of a party.
2469,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2470,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,"I shall tell him that, coming to blows, the assailant is often in the"
2471,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,right; that the assailed is always.
2472,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2473,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,

2475,JOHN OF GAUNT AND JOANNA OF KENT,
2476,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA
2477,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2478,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2479,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ There is a dearth in the land, my sweet Leofric! Remember"
2480,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"how many weeks of drought we have had, even in the deep pastures of"
2481,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,Leicestershire; and how many Sundays we have heard the same prayers
2482,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"for rain, and supplications that it would please the Lord in His mercy"
2483,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"to turn aside His anger from the poor, pining cattle. You, my dear"
2484,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"husband, have imprisoned more than one malefactor for leaving his dead"
2485,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,ox in the public way; and other hinds have fled before you out of the
2486,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"traces, in which they, and their sons and their daughters, and haply"
2487,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"their old fathers and mothers, were dragging the abandoned wain"
2488,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,homeward. Although we were accompanied by many brave spearmen and
2489,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"skilful archers, it was perilous to pass the creatures which the"
2490,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"farmyard dogs, driven from the hearth by the poverty of their masters,"
2491,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"were tearing and devouring; while others, bitten and lamed, filled the"
2492,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"air either with long and deep howls or sharp and quick barkings, as"
2493,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"they struggled with hunger and feebleness, or were exasperated by heat"
2494,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"and pain. Nor could the thyme from the heath, nor the bruised branches"
2495,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"of the fir-tree, extinguish or abate the foul odour."
2496,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2497,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Leofric._ And now, Godiva, my darling, thou art afraid we should be"
2498,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,eaten up before we enter the gates of Coventry; or perchance that in
2499,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"the gardens there are no roses to greet thee, no sweet herbs for thy"
2500,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,mat and pillow.
2501,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2502,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ Leofric, I have no such fears. This is the month of roses: I"
2503,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"find them everywhere since my blessed marriage. They, and all other"
2504,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"sweet herbs, I know not why, seem to greet me wherever I look at them,"
2505,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,as though they knew and expected me. Surely they cannot feel that I am
2506,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,fond of them.
2507,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2508,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Leofric._ O light, laughing simpleton! But what wouldst thou? I came"
2509,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"not hither to pray; and yet if praying would satisfy thee, or remove"
2510,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"the drought, I would ride up straightway to Saint Michael's and pray"
2511,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,until morning.
2512,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2513,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ I would do the same, O Leofric! but God hath turned away His"
2514,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"ear from holier lips than mine. Would my own dear husband hear me, if"
2515,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,I implored him for what is easier to accomplish--what he can do like
2516,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,God?
2517,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2518,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Leofric._ How! what is it?
2519,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2520,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ I would not, in the first hurry of your wrath, appeal to"
2521,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"you, my loving lord, on behalf of these unhappy men who have offended"
2522,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,you.
2523,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2524,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Leofric._ Unhappy! is that all?
2525,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2526,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ Unhappy they must surely be, to have offended you so"
2527,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,grievously. What a soft air breathes over us! how quiet and serene and
2528,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,still an evening! how calm are the heavens and the earth! Shall none
2529,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"enjoy them; not even we, my Leofric? The sun is ready to set: let it"
2530,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"never set, O Leofric, on your anger. These are not my words: they are"
2531,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,better than mine. Should they lose their virtue from my unworthiness
2532,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,in uttering them?
2533,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2534,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Leofric._ Godiva, wouldst thou plead to me for rebels?"
2535,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2536,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ They have, then, drawn the sword against you? Indeed, I knew"
2537,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,it not.
2538,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2539,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Leofric._ They have omitted to send me my dues, established by my"
2540,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"ancestors, well knowing of our nuptials, and of the charges and"
2541,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"festivities they require, and that in a season of such scarcity my own"
2542,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,lands are insufficient.
2543,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2544,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ If they were starving, as they said they were----"
2545,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2546,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Leofric._ Must I starve too? Is it not enough to lose my vassals?
2547,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2548,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Godiva._ Enough! O God! too much! too much! May you never lose them!
2549,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"Give them life, peace, comfort, contentment. There are those among"
2550,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"them who kissed me in my infancy, and who blessed me at the baptismal"
2551,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"font. Leofric, Leofric! the first old man I meet I shall think is one"
2552,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"of those; and I shall think on the blessing he gave, and (ah me!) on"
2553,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"the blessing I bring back to him. My heart will bleed, will burst; and"
2554,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"he will weep at it! he will weep, poor soul, for the wife of a cruel"
2555,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"lord who denounces vengeance on him, who carries death into his"
2556,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,family!
2557,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2558,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Leofric._ We must hold solemn festivals.
2559,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2560,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ We must, indeed."
2561,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2562,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Leofric._ Well, then?"
2563,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2564,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Godiva._ Is the clamorousness that succeeds the death of God's dumb
2565,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"creatures, are crowded halls, are slaughtered cattle festivals?--are"
2566,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"maddening songs, and giddy dances, and hireling praises from"
2567,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,parti-coloured coats? Can the voice of a minstrel tell us better
2568,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,things of ourselves than our own internal one might tell us; or can
2569,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,his breath make our breath softer in sleep? O my beloved! let
2570,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"everything be a joyance to us: it will, if we will. Sad is the day,"
2571,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"and worse must follow, when we hear the blackbird in the garden, and"
2572,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"do not throb with joy. But, Leofric, the high festival is strown by"
2573,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"the servant of God upon the heart of man. It is gladness, it is"
2574,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"thanksgiving; it is the orphan, the starveling, pressed to the bosom,"
2575,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,and bidden as its first commandment to remember its benefactor. We
2576,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,will hold this festival; the guests are ready: we may keep it up for
2577,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"weeks, and months, and years together, and always be the happier and"
2578,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"the richer for it. The beverage of this feast, O Leofric, is sweeter"
2579,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,than bee or flower or vine can give us: it flows from heaven; and in
2580,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,heaven will it abundantly be poured out again to him who pours it out
2581,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,here abundantly.
2582,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2583,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Leofric._ Thou art wild.
2584,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2585,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ I have, indeed, lost myself. Some Power, some good kind"
2586,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"Power, melts me (body and soul and voice) into tenderness and love. O"
2587,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"my husband, we must obey it. Look upon me! look upon me! lift your"
2588,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,sweet eyes from the ground! I will not cease to supplicate; I dare
2589,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,not.
2590,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2591,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Leofric._ We may think upon it.
2592,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2593,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ Oh, never say that! What! think upon goodness when you can"
2594,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,be good? Let not the infants cry for sustenance! The Mother of Our
2595,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"Blessed Lord will hear them; us never, never afterward."
2596,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2597,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Leofric._ Here comes the bishop: we are but one mile from the walls.
2598,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,Why dismountest thou? no bishop can expect this. Godiva! my honour and
2599,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,rank among men are humbled by this. Earl Godwin will hear of it. Up!
2600,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,up! the bishop hath seen it: he urgeth his horse onward. Dost thou not
2601,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,hear him now upon the solid turf behind thee?
2602,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2603,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ Never, no, never will I rise, O Leofric, until you remit"
2604,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"this most impious task--this tax on hard labour, on hard life."
2605,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2606,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Leofric._ Turn round: look how the fat nag canters, as to the tune of"
2607,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"a sinner's psalm, slow and hard-breathing. What reason or right can"
2608,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"the people have to complain, while their bishop's steed is so sleek"
2609,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"and well caparisoned? Inclination to change, desire to abolish old"
2610,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"usages. Up! up! for shame! They shall smart for it, idlers! Sir"
2611,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"Bishop, I must blush for my young bride."
2612,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2613,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ My husband, my husband! will you pardon the city?"
2614,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2615,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Leofric._ Sir Bishop! I could think you would have seen her in this
2616,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"plight. Will I pardon? Yea, Godiva, by the holy rood, will I pardon"
2617,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"the city, when thou ridest naked at noontide through the streets!"
2618,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2619,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ O my dear, cruel Leofric, where is the heart you gave me? It"
2620,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,was not so: can mine have hardened it?
2621,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2622,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Bishop._ Earl, thou abashest thy spouse; she turneth pale, and"
2623,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"weepeth. Lady Godiva, peace be with thee."
2624,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2625,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ Thanks, holy man! peace will be with me when peace is with"
2626,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,your city. Did you hear my lord's cruel word?
2627,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2628,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Bishop._ I did, lady."
2629,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2630,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ Will you remember it, and pray against it?"
2631,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2632,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Bishop._ Wilt _thou_ forget it, daughter?"
2633,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2634,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Godiva._ I am not offended.
2635,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2636,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Bishop._ Angel of peace and purity!
2637,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2638,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ But treasure it up in your heart: deem it an incense, good"
2639,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"only when it is consumed and spent, ascending with prayer and"
2640,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"sacrifice. And, now, what was it?"
2641,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2642,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Bishop._ Christ save us! that He will pardon the city when thou
2643,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,ridest naked through the streets at noon.
2644,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2645,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Godiva._ Did he swear an oath?
2646,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2647,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Bishop._ He sware by the holy rood.
2648,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2649,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ My Redeemer, Thou hast heard it! save the city!"
2650,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2651,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Leofric._ We are now upon the beginning of the pavement: these are
2652,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,the suburbs. Let us think of feasting: we may pray afterward;
2653,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,to-morrow we shall rest.
2654,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2655,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ No judgments, then, to-morrow, Leofric?"
2656,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2657,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Leofric._ None: we will carouse.
2658,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2659,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Godiva._ The saints of heaven have given me strength and confidence;
2660,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,my prayers are heard; the heart of my beloved is now softened.
2661,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2662,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Leofric._ Ay, ay."
2663,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2664,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ Say, dearest Leofric, is there indeed no other hope, no"
2665,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,other mediation?
2666,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2667,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Leofric._ I have sworn. Beside, thou hast made me redden and turn my"
2668,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"face away from thee, and all the knaves have seen it: this adds to the"
2669,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,city's crime.
2670,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2671,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ I have blushed, too, Leofric, and was not rash nor obdurate."
2672,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2673,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Leofric._ But thou, my sweetest, art given to blushing: there is no"
2674,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,conquering it in thee. I wish thou hadst not alighted so hastily and
2675,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,roughly: it hath shaken down a sheaf of thy hair. Take heed thou sit
2676,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"not upon it, lest it anguish thee. Well done! it mingleth now sweetly"
2677,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"with the cloth of gold upon the saddle, running here and there, as if"
2678,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"it had life and faculties and business, and were working thereupon"
2679,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,some newer and cunninger device. O my beauteous Eve! there is a
2680,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,Paradise about thee! the world is refreshed as thou movest and
2681,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,breathest on it. I cannot see or think of evil where thou art. I could
2682,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,throw my arms even here about thee. No signs for me! no shaking of
2683,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"sunbeams! no reproof or frown of wonderment.--I _will_ say it--now,"
2684,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"then, for worse--I could close with my kisses thy half-open lips, ay,"
2685,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"and those lovely and loving eyes, before the people."
2686,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2687,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"_Godiva._ To-morrow you shall kiss me, and they shall bless you for"
2688,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"it. I shall be very pale, for to-night I must fast and pray."
2689,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2690,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Leofric._ I do not hear thee; the voices of the folk are so loud
2691,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,under this archway.
2692,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2693,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,_Godiva._ [_To herself._] God help them! good kind souls! I hope they
2694,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,will not crowd about me so to-morrow. O Leofric! could my name be
2695,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"forgotten, and yours alone remembered! But perhaps my innocence may"
2696,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,save me from reproach; and how many as innocent are in fear and
2697,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,famine! No eye will open on me but fresh from tears. What a young
2698,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,mother for so large a family! Shall my youth harm me? Under God's hand
2699,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,it gives me courage. Ah! when will the morning come? Ah! when will the
2700,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,noon be over?
2701,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2702,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"The story of Godiva, at one of whose festivals or"
2703,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"fairs I was present in my boyhood, has always much"
2704,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"interested me; and I wrote a poem on it, sitting, I"
2705,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"remember, by the _square pool_ at Rugby. When I showed"
2706,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"it to the friend in whom I had most confidence, he"
2707,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"began to scoff at the subject; and, on his reaching"
2708,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"the last line, his laughter was loud and immoderate."
2709,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,This conversation has brought both laughter and stanza
2710,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"back to me, and the earnestness with which I entreated"
2711,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"and implored my friend _not to tell the lads_, so"
2712,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,heart-strickenly and desperately was I ashamed. The
2713,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"verses are these, if any one else should wish another"
2714,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,laugh at me:
2715,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2716,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"'In every hour, in every mood,"
2717,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"O lady, it is sweet and good"
2718,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,To bathe the soul in prayer;
2719,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"And, at the close of such a day,"
2720,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,"When we have ceased to bless and pray,"
2721,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,To dream on thy long hair.'
2722,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2723,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,May the peppermint be still growing on the bank in
2724,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,that place!
2725,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2726,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2727,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2728,LEOFRIC AND GODIVA,
2729,ESSEX AND SPENSER,ESSEX AND SPENSER
2730,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2731,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2732,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Essex._ Instantly on hearing of thy arrival from Ireland, I sent a"
2733,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"message to thee, good Edmund, that I might learn, from one so"
2734,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"judicious and dispassionate as thou art, the real state of things in"
2735,ESSEX AND SPENSER,that distracted country; it having pleased the queen's Majesty to
2736,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"think of appointing me her deputy, in order to bring the rebellious to"
2737,ESSEX AND SPENSER,submission.
2738,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2739,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Spenser._ Wisely and well considered; but more worthily of her
2740,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"judgment than her affection. May your lordship overcome, as you have"
2741,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"ever done, the difficulties and dangers you foresee."
2742,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2743,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Essex._ We grow weak by striking at random; and knowing that I must
2744,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"strike, and strike heavily, I would fain see exactly where the stroke"
2745,ESSEX AND SPENSER,shall fall.
2746,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2747,ESSEX AND SPENSER,Now what tale have you for us?
2748,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2749,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Spenser._ Interrogate me, my lord, that I may answer each question"
2750,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"distinctly, my mind being in sad confusion at what I have seen and"
2751,ESSEX AND SPENSER,undergone.
2752,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2753,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Essex._ Give me thy account and opinion of these very affairs as thou
2754,ESSEX AND SPENSER,leftest them; for I would rather know one part well than all
2755,ESSEX AND SPENSER,imperfectly; and the violences of which I have heard within the day
2756,ESSEX AND SPENSER,surpass belief.
2757,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2758,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"Why weepest thou, my gentle Spenser? Have the rebels sacked thy house?"
2759,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2760,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Spenser._ They have plundered and utterly destroyed it.
2761,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2762,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Essex._ I grieve for thee, and will see thee righted."
2763,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2764,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Spenser._ In this they have little harmed me.
2765,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2766,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Essex._ How! I have heard it reported that thy grounds are fertile,"
2767,ESSEX AND SPENSER,and thy mansion large and pleasant.
2768,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2769,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Spenser._ If river and lake and meadow-ground and mountain could
2770,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"render any place the abode of pleasantness, pleasant was mine, indeed!"
2771,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2772,ESSEX AND SPENSER,On the lovely banks of Mulla I found deep contentment. Under the dark
2773,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"alders did I muse and meditate. Innocent hopes were my gravest cares,"
2774,ESSEX AND SPENSER,and my playfullest fancy was with kindly wishes. Ah! surely of all
2775,ESSEX AND SPENSER,cruelties the worst is to extinguish our kindness. Mine is gone: I
2776,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"love the people and the land no longer. My lord, ask me not about"
2777,ESSEX AND SPENSER,them: I may speak injuriously.
2778,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2779,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Essex._ Think rather, then, of thy happier hours and busier"
2780,ESSEX AND SPENSER,occupations; these likewise may instruct me.
2781,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2782,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Spenser._ The first seeds I sowed in the garden, ere the old castle"
2783,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"was made habitable for my lovely bride, were acorns from Penshurst. I"
2784,ESSEX AND SPENSER,planted a little oak before my mansion at the birth of each child. My
2785,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"sons, I said to myself, shall often play in the shade of them when I"
2786,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"am gone; and every year shall they take the measure of their growth,"
2787,ESSEX AND SPENSER,as fondly as I take theirs.
2788,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2789,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Essex._ Well, well; but let not this thought make thee weep so"
2790,ESSEX AND SPENSER,bitterly.
2791,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2792,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Spenser._ Poison may ooze from beautiful plants; deadly grief from
2793,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"dearest reminiscences. I _must_ grieve, I _must_ weep: it seems the"
2794,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"law of God, and the only one that men are not disposed to contravene."
2795,ESSEX AND SPENSER,In the performance of this alone do they effectually aid one another.
2796,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2797,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Essex._ Spenser! I wish I had at hand any arguments or persuasions of
2798,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"force sufficient to remove thy sorrow; but, really, I am not in the"
2799,ESSEX AND SPENSER,habit of seeing men grieve at anything except the loss of favour at
2800,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"court, or of a hawk, or of a buck-hound. And were I to swear out"
2801,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"condolences to a man of thy discernment, in the same round, roll-call"
2802,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"phrases we employ with one another upon these occasions, I should be"
2803,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"guilty, not of insincerity, but of insolence. True grief hath ever"
2804,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"something sacred in it; and, when it visiteth a wise man and a brave"
2805,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"one, is most holy."
2806,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2807,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"Nay, kiss not my hand: he whom God smiteth hath God with him. In His"
2808,ESSEX AND SPENSER,presence what am I?
2809,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2810,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Spenser._ Never so great, my lord, as at this hour, when you see"
2811,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"aright who is greater. May He guide your counsels, and preserve your"
2812,ESSEX AND SPENSER,life and glory!
2813,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2814,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Essex._ Where are thy friends? Are they with thee?
2815,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2816,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Spenser._ Ah, where, indeed! Generous, true-hearted Philip! where art"
2817,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"thou, whose presence was unto me peace and safety; whose smile was"
2818,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"contentment, and whose praise renown? My lord! I cannot but think of"
2819,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"him among still heavier losses: he was my earliest friend, and would"
2820,ESSEX AND SPENSER,have taught me wisdom.
2821,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2822,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Essex._ Pastoral poetry, my dear Spenser, doth not require tears and"
2823,ESSEX AND SPENSER,lamentations. Dry thine eyes; rebuild thine house: the queen and
2824,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"council, I venture to promise thee, will make ample amends for every"
2825,ESSEX AND SPENSER,evil thou hast sustained. What! does that enforce thee to wail still
2826,ESSEX AND SPENSER,louder?
2827,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2828,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Spenser._ Pardon me, bear with me, most noble heart! I have lost what"
2829,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"no council, no queen, no Essex, can restore."
2830,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2831,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Essex._ We will see that. There are other swords, and other arms to"
2832,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"yield them, beside a Leicester's and a Raleigh's. Others can crush"
2833,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"their enemies, and serve their friends."
2834,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2835,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Spenser._ O my sweet child! And of many so powerful, many so wise and"
2836,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"so beneficent, was there none to save thee? None, none!"
2837,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2838,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Essex._ I now perceive that thou lamentest what almost every father
2839,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"is destined to lament. Happiness must be bought, although the payment"
2840,ESSEX AND SPENSER,may be delayed. Consider: the same calamity might have befallen thee
2841,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"here in London. Neither the houses of ambassadors, nor the palaces of"
2842,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"kings, nor the altars of God Himself, are asylums against death. How"
2843,ESSEX AND SPENSER,do I know but under this very roof there may sleep some latent
2844,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"calamity, that in an instant shall cover with gloom every inmate of"
2845,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"the house, and every far dependent?"
2846,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2847,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Spenser._ God avert it!
2848,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2849,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Essex._ Every day, every hour of the year, do hundreds mourn what"
2850,ESSEX AND SPENSER,thou mournest.
2851,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2852,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Spenser._ Oh, no, no, no! Calamities there are around us; calamities"
2853,ESSEX AND SPENSER,there are all over the earth; calamities there are in all seasons: but
2854,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"none in any season, none in any place, like mine."
2855,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2856,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Essex._ So say all fathers, so say all husbands. Look at any old"
2857,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"mansion-house, and let the sun shine as gloriously as it may on the"
2858,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"golden vanes, or the arms recently quartered over the gateway or the"
2859,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"embayed window, and on the happy pair that haply is toying at it:"
2860,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"nevertheless, thou mayest say that of a certainty the same fabric hath"
2861,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"seen much sorrow within its chambers, and heard many wailings; and"
2862,ESSEX AND SPENSER,each time this was the heaviest stroke of all. Funerals have passed
2863,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"along through the stout-hearted knights upon the wainscot, and amid"
2864,ESSEX AND SPENSER,the laughing nymphs upon the arras. Old servants have shaken their
2865,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"heads, as if somebody had deceived them, when they found that beauty"
2866,ESSEX AND SPENSER,and nobility could perish.
2867,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2868,ESSEX AND SPENSER,Edmund! the things that are too true pass by us as if they were not
2869,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"true at all; and when they have singled us out, then only do they"
2870,ESSEX AND SPENSER,strike us. Thou and I must go too. Perhaps the next year may blow us
2871,ESSEX AND SPENSER,away with its fallen leaves.
2872,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2873,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Spenser._ For you, my lord, many years (I trust) are waiting: I never"
2874,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"shall see those fallen leaves. No leaf, no bud, will spring upon the"
2875,ESSEX AND SPENSER,earth before I sink into her breast for ever.
2876,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2877,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Essex._ Thou, who art wiser than most men, shouldst bear with"
2878,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"patience, equanimity, and courage what is common to all."
2879,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2880,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Spenser._ Enough, enough, enough! Have all men seen their infant"
2881,ESSEX AND SPENSER,burnt to ashes before their eyes?
2882,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2883,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Essex._ Gracious God! Merciful Father! what is this?
2884,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2885,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Spenser._ Burnt alive! burnt to ashes! burnt to ashes! The flames
2886,ESSEX AND SPENSER,dart their serpent tongues through the nursery window. I cannot quit
2887,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"thee, my Elizabeth! I cannot lay down our Edmund! Oh, these flames!"
2888,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"They persecute, they enthral me; they curl round my temples; they hiss"
2889,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"upon my brain; they taunt me with their fierce, foul voices; they carp"
2890,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"at me, they wither me, they consume me, throwing back to me a little"
2891,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"of life to roll and suffer in, with their fangs upon me. Ask me, my"
2892,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"lord, the things you wish to know from me: I may answer them; I am now"
2893,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"composed again. Command me, my gracious lord! I would yet serve you:"
2894,ESSEX AND SPENSER,soon I shall be unable. You have stooped to raise me up; you have
2895,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"borne with me; you have pitied me, even like one not powerful. You"
2896,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"have brought comfort, and will leave it with me, for gratitude is"
2897,ESSEX AND SPENSER,comfort.
2898,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2899,ESSEX AND SPENSER,Oh! my memory stands all a-tiptoe on one burning point: when it drops
2900,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"from it, then it perishes. Spare me: ask me nothing; let me weep"
2901,ESSEX AND SPENSER,before you in peace--the kindest act of greatness.
2902,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2903,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Essex._ I should rather have dared to mount into the midst of the
2904,ESSEX AND SPENSER,conflagration than I now dare entreat thee not to weep. The tears that
2905,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"overflow thy heart, my Spenser, will staunch and heal it in their"
2906,ESSEX AND SPENSER,sacred stream; but not without hope in God.
2907,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2908,ESSEX AND SPENSER,_Spenser._ My hope in God is that I may soon see again what He has
2909,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"taken from me. Amid the myriads of angels, there is not one so"
2910,ESSEX AND SPENSER,beautiful; and even he (if there be any) who is appointed my guardian
2911,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"could never love me so. Ah! these are idle thoughts, vain wanderings,"
2912,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"distempered dreams. If there ever were guardian angels, he who so"
2913,ESSEX AND SPENSER,wanted one--my helpless boy--would not have left these arms upon my
2914,ESSEX AND SPENSER,knees.
2915,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2916,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"_Essex._ God help and sustain thee, too gentle Spenser! I never will"
2917,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"desert thee. But what am I? Great they have called me! Alas, how"
2918,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"powerless, then, and infantile is greatness in the presence of"
2919,ESSEX AND SPENSER,calamity!
2920,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2921,ESSEX AND SPENSER,"Come, give me thy hand: let us walk up and down the gallery. Bravely"
2922,ESSEX AND SPENSER,done! I will envy no more a Sidney or a Raleigh.
2923,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2924,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2925,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2926,ESSEX AND SPENSER,
2927,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER
2928,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
2929,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
2930,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"_Bacon._ Hearing much of your worthiness and wisdom, Master Richard"
2931,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"Hooker, I have besought your comfort and consolation in this my too"
2932,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,heavy affliction: for we often do stand in need of hearing what we
2933,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"know full well, and our own balsams must be poured into our breasts by"
2934,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,another's hand. As the air at our doors is sometimes more expeditious
2935,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,in removing pain and heaviness from the body than the most far-fetched
2936,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"remedies would be, so the voice alone of a neighbourly and friendly"
2937,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"visitant may be more effectual in assuaging our sorrows, than whatever"
2938,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,is most forcible in rhetoric and most recondite in wisdom. On these
2939,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"occasions we cannot put ourselves in a posture to receive the latter,"
2940,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,and still less are we at leisure to look into the corners of our
2941,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"store-room, and to uncurl the leaves of our references. As for Memory,"
2942,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"who, you may tell me, would save us the trouble, she is footsore"
2943,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"enough in all conscience with me, without going farther back."
2944,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"Withdrawn as you live from court and courtly men, and having ears"
2945,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"occupied by better reports than such as are flying about me, yet haply"
2946,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"so hard a case as mine, befalling a man heretofore not averse from the"
2947,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"studies in which you take delight, may have touched you with some"
2948,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,concern.
2949,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
2950,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"_Hooker._ I do think, my Lord of Verulam, that, unhappy as you appear,"
2951,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"God in sooth has forgone to chasten you, and that the day which in His"
2952,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"wisdom He appointed for your trial, was the very day on which the"
2953,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,king's Majesty gave unto your ward and custody the great seal of his
2954,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,English realm. And yet perhaps it may be--let me utter it without
2955,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,offence--that your features and stature were from that day forward no
2956,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,longer what they were before. Such an effect do power and rank and
2957,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,office produce even on prudent and religious men.
2958,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
2959,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"A hound's whelp howleth, if you pluck him up above where he stood:"
2960,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"man, in much greater peril from falling, doth rejoice. You, my lord,"
2961,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"as befitted you, are smitten and contrite, and do appear in deep"
2962,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,wretchedness and tribulation to your servants and those about you; but
2963,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,I know that there is always a balm which lies uppermost in these
2964,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"afflictions, and that no heart rightly softened can be very sore."
2965,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
2966,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"_Bacon._ And yet, Master Richard, it is surely no small matter to"
2967,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,lose the respect of those who looked up to us for countenance; and the
2968,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"favour of a right learned king; and, O Master Hooker, such a power of"
2969,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"money! But money is mere dross. I should always hold it so, if it"
2970,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"possessed not two qualities: that of making men treat us reverently,"
2971,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,and that of enabling us to help the needy.
2972,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
2973,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"_Hooker._ The respect, I think, of those who respect us for what a"
2974,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"fool can give and a rogue can take away, may easily be dispensed with;"
2975,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,but it is indeed a high prerogative to help the needy; and when it
2976,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"pleases the Almighty to deprive us of it, let us believe that He"
2977,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,foreknoweth our inclination to negligence in the charge entrusted to
2978,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"us, and that in His mercy He hath removed from us a most fearful"
2979,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,responsibility.
2980,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
2981,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,_Bacon._ I know a number of poor gentlemen to whom I could have
2982,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,rendered aid.
2983,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
2984,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,_Hooker._ Have you examined and sifted their worthiness?
2985,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
2986,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,_Bacon._ Well and deeply.
2987,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
2988,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"_Hooker._ Then must you have known them long before your adversity,"
2989,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,and while the means of succouring them were in your hands.
2990,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
2991,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"_Bacon._ You have circumvented and entrapped me, Master Hooker. Faith!"
2992,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"I am mortified: you the schoolman, I the schoolboy!"
2993,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
2994,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"_Hooker._ Say not so, my lord. Your years, indeed, are fewer than"
2995,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"mine, by seven or thereabout; but your knowledge is far higher, your"
2996,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,experience richer. Our wits are not always in blossom upon us. When
2997,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"the roses are overcharged and languid, up springs a spike of rue."
2998,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,Mortified on such an occasion? God forfend it! But again to the
2999,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,business. I should never be over-penitent for my neglect of needy
3000,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,gentlemen who have neglected themselves much worse. They have chosen
3001,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,their profession with its chances and contingencies. If they had
3002,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,protected their country by their courage or adorned it by their
3003,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"studies, they would have merited, and under a king of such learning"
3004,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"and such equity would have received in some sort, their reward. I look"
3005,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"upon them as so many old cabinets of ivory and tortoise-shell,"
3006,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"scratched, flawed, splintered, rotten, defective both within and"
3007,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"without, hard to unlock, insecure to lock up again, unfit to use."
3008,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
3009,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"_Bacon._ Methinks it beginneth to rain, Master Richard. What if we"
3010,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"comfort our bodies with a small cup of wine, against the ill-temper of"
3011,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"the air. Wherefore, in God's name, are you affrightened?"
3012,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
3013,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"_Hooker._ Not so, my lord; not so."
3014,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
3015,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,_Bacon._ What then affects you?
3016,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
3017,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"_Hooker._ Why, indeed, since your lordship interrogates me--I looked,"
3018,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"idly and imprudently, into that rich buffet; and I saw, unless the"
3019,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"haze of the weather has come into the parlour, or my sight is the"
3020,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"worse for last night's reading, no fewer than six silver pints."
3021,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"Surely, six tables for company are laid only at coronations."
3022,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
3023,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,_Bacon._ There are many men so squeamish that forsooth they would keep
3024,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"a cup to themselves, and never communicate it to their nearest and"
3025,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"best friend; a fashion which seems to me offensive in an honest house,"
3026,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"where no disease of ill repute ought to be feared. We have lately,"
3027,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"Master Richard, adopted strange fashions; we have run into the wildest"
3028,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"luxuries. The Lord Leicester, I heard it from my father--God forfend"
3029,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,it should ever be recorded in our history!--when he entertained Queen
3030,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"Elizabeth at Kenilworth Castle, laid before her Majesty a fork of pure"
3031,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"silver. I the more easily credit it, as Master Thomas Coriatt doth"
3032,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,vouch for having seen the same monstrous sign of voluptuousness at
3033,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"Venice. We are surely the especial favourites of Providence, when such"
3034,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"wantonness hath not melted us quite away. After this portent, it would"
3035,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,otherwise have appeared incredible that we should have broken the
3036,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,Spanish Armada.
3037,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
3038,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,Pledge me: hither comes our wine.
3039,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
3040,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,[_To the Servant._] Dolt! villain! is not this the beverage I reserve
3041,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,for myself?
3042,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
3043,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,The blockhead must imagine that Malmsey runs in a stream under the
3044,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"ocean, like the Alpheus. Bear with me, good Master Hooker, but verily"
3045,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"I have little of this wine, and I keep it as a medicine for my many"
3046,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,and growing infirmities. You are healthy at present: God in His
3047,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,infinite mercy long maintain you so! Weaker drink is more wholesome
3048,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,for you. The lighter ones of France are best accommodated by Nature to
3049,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"our constitutions, and therefore she has placed them so within our"
3050,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"reach that we have only to stretch out our necks, in a manner, and"
3051,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"drink them from the vat. But this Malmsey, this Malmsey, flies from"
3052,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"centre to circumference, and makes youthful blood boil."
3053,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
3054,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"_Hooker._ Of a truth, my knowledge in such matters is but spare. My"
3055,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"Lord of Canterbury once ordered part of a goblet, containing some"
3056,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"strong Spanish wine, to be taken to me from his table when I dined by"
3057,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"sufferance with his chaplains, and, although a most discreet, prudent"
3058,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"man as befitteth his high station, was not so chary of my health as"
3059,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"your lordship. Wine is little to be trifled with, physic less. The"
3060,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"Cretans, the brewers of this Malmsey, have many aromatic and powerful"
3061,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"herbs among them. On their mountains, and notably on Ida, grows that"
3062,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"dittany which works such marvels, and which perhaps may give activity"
3063,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"to this hot medicinal drink of theirs. I would not touch it,"
3064,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"knowingly: an unregarded leaf, dropped into it above the ordinary,"
3065,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,might add such puissance to the concoction as almost to break the
3066,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,buckles in my shoes; since we have good and valid authority that the
3067,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"wounded hart, on eating thereof, casts the arrow out of his haunch or"
3068,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"entrails, although it stuck a palm deep.[4]"
3069,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
3070,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,_Bacon._ When I read of such things I doubt them. Religion and
3071,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"politics belong to God, and to God's vicegerent the king; we must not"
3072,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,touch upon them unadvisedly: but if I could procure a plant of dittany
3073,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"on easy terms, I would persuade my apothecary and my gamekeeper to"
3074,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,make some experiments.
3075,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
3076,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,_Hooker._ I dare not distrust what grave writers have declared in
3077,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,matters beyond my knowledge.
3078,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
3079,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"_Bacon._ Good Master Hooker, I have read many of your reasonings, and"
3080,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"they are admirably well sustained: added to which, your genius has"
3081,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,given such a strong current to your language as can come only from a
3082,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"mighty elevation and a most abundant plenteousness. Yet forgive me, in"
3083,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"God's name, my worthy master, if you descried in me some expression of"
3084,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,wonder at your simplicity. We are all weak and vulnerable somewhere:
3085,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"common men in the higher parts; heroes, as was feigned of Achilles, in"
3086,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"the lower. You would define to a hair's-breadth the qualities, states,"
3087,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"and dependencies of principalities, dominations, and powers; you would"
3088,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,be unerring about the apostles and the churches; and 'tis marvellous
3089,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,how you wander about a pot-herb!
3090,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
3091,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"_Hooker._ I know my poor weak intellects, most noble lord, and how"
3092,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,scantily they have profited by my hard painstaking. Comprehending few
3093,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"things, and those imperfectly, I say only what others have said"
3094,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"before, wise men and holy; and if, by passing through my heart into"
3095,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"the wide world around me, it pleaseth God that this little treasure"
3096,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"shall have lost nothing of its weight and pureness, my exultation is"
3097,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,then the exultation of humility. Wisdom consisteth not in knowing many
3098,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"things, nor even in knowing them thoroughly; but in choosing and in"
3099,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,following what conduces the most certainly to our lasting happiness
3100,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"and true glory. And this wisdom, my Lord of Verulam, cometh from"
3101,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,above.
3102,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,
3103,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,_Bacon._ I have observed among the well-informed and the ill-informed

3105,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"rather the wiser keep them separate, and those who are wisest of all"
3106,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"keep them better out of sight. Now, examine the sayings and writings"
3107,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"of the prime philosophers, and you will often find them, Master"
3108,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"Richard, to be untruths made to resemble truths. The business with"
3109,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"them is to approximate as nearly as possible, and not to touch it: the"
3110,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"goal of the charioteer is _evitata fervidis rotis_, as some poet"
3111,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"saith. But we who care nothing for chants and cadences, and have no"
3112,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"time to catch at applauses, push forward over stones and sands"
3113,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"straightway to our object. I have persuaded men, and shall persuade"
3114,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"them for ages, that I possess a wide range of thought unexplored by"
3115,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"others, and first thrown open by me, with many fair enclosures of"
3116,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,choice and abstruse knowledge. I have incited and instructed them to
3117,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,examine all subjects of useful and rational inquiry; few that occurred
3118,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"to me have I myself left untouched or untried: one, however, hath"
3119,LORD BACON AND RICHARD HOOKER,"almost escaped me, and surely one worth the trouble."

3142,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3143,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_Noble._ I hope, General Cromwell, to persuade you that the death of"
3144,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,Charles will be considered by all Europe as a most atrocious action.
3145,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3146,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,_Cromwell._ Thou hast already persuaded me: what then?
3147,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3148,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_Noble._ Surely, then, you will prevent it, for your authority is"
3149,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,great. Even those who upon their consciences found him guilty would
3150,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"remit the penalty of blood, some from policy, some from mercy. I have"
3151,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"conversed with Hutchinson, with Ludlow,[5] your friend and mine, with"
3152,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"Henry Nevile, and Walter Long: you will oblige these worthy friends,"
3153,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,and unite in your favour the suffrages of the truest and trustiest men
3154,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"living. There are many others, with whom I am in no habits of"
3155,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"intercourse, who are known to entertain the same sentiments; and these"
3156,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"also are among the country gentlemen, to whom our parliament owes the"
3157,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,better part of its reputation.
3158,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3159,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,_Cromwell._ You country gentlemen bring with you into the People's
3160,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,House a freshness and sweet savour which our citizens lack mightily. I
3161,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"would fain merit your esteem, heedless of those pursy fellows from"
3162,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"hulks and warehouses, with one ear lappeted by the pen behind it, and"
3163,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"the other an heirloom, as Charles would have had it, in Laud's"
3164,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"Star-chamber. Oh, they are proud and bloody men! My heart melts; but,"
3165,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,alas! my authority is null: I am the servant of the Commonwealth. I
3166,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"will not, dare not, betray it. If Charles Stuart had threatened my"
3167,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"death only, in the letter we ripped out of the saddle, I would have"
3168,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,reproved him manfully and turned him adrift: but others are concerned;
3169,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"lives more precious than mine, worn as it is with fastings, prayers,"
3170,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"long services, and preyed upon by a pouncing disease. The Lord hath"
3171,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,led him into the toils laid for the innocent. Foolish man! he never
3172,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,could eschew evil counsel.
3173,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3174,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_Noble._ In comparison with you, he is but as a pinnacle to a"
3175,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"buttress. I acknowledge his weaknesses, and cannot wink upon his"
3176,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,crimes: but that which you visit as the heaviest of them perhaps was
3177,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"not so, although the most disastrous to both parties--the bearing of"
3178,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,arms against his people. He fought for what he considered his
3179,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,hereditary property; we do the same: should we be hanged for losing a
3180,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,lawsuit?
3181,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3182,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_Cromwell._ No, unless it is the second. Thou talkest finely and"
3183,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"foolishly, Wat, for a man of thy calm discernment. If a rogue holds a"
3184,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"pistol to my breast, do I ask him who he is? Do I care whether his"
3185,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,doublet be of cat-skin or of dog-skin? Fie upon such wicked sophisms!
3186,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"Marvellous, how the devil works upon good men's minds!"
3187,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3188,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,_Noble._ Charles was always more to be dreaded by his friends than by
3189,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"his enemies, and now by neither."
3190,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3191,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,_Cromwell._ God forbid that Englishmen should be feared by Englishmen!
3192,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"but to be daunted by the weakest, to bend before the worst--I tell"
3193,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"thee, Walter Noble, if Moses and the prophets commanded me to this"
3194,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"villainy, I would draw back and mount my horse."
3195,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3196,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_Noble._ I wish that our history, already too dark with blood, should"
3197,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"contain, as far as we are concerned in it, some unpolluted pages."
3198,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3199,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_Cromwell._ 'Twere better, much better. Never shall I be called, I"
3200,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"promise thee, an unnecessary shedder of blood. Remember, my good,"
3201,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"prudent friend, of what materials our sectaries are composed: what"
3202,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"hostility against all eminence, what rancour against all glory. Not"
3203,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"only kingly power offends them, but every other; and they talk of"
3204,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_putting to the sword_, as if it were the quietest, gentlest, and most"
3205,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,ordinary thing in the world. The knaves even dictate from their stools
3206,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"and benches to men in armour, bruised and bleeding for them; and with"
3207,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,school-dames' scourges in their fists do they give counsel to those
3208,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"who protect them from the cart and halter. In the name of the Lord, I"
3209,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,must spit outright (or worse) upon these crackling bouncing
3210,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"firebrands, before I can make them tractable."
3211,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3212,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,_Noble._ I lament their blindness; but follies wear out the faster by
3213,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,being hard run upon. This fermenting sourness will presently turn
3214,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"vapid, and people will cast it out. I am not surprised that you are"
3215,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"discontented and angry at what thwarts your better nature. But come,"
3216,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"Cromwell, overlook them, despise them, and erect to yourself a"
3217,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,glorious name by sparing a mortal enemy.
3218,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3219,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_Cromwell._ A glorious name, by God's blessing, I will erect; and all"
3220,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,our fellow-labourers shall rejoice at it: but I see better than they
3221,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"do the blow descending on them, and my arm better than theirs can ward"
3222,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"it off. Noble, thy heart overflows with kindness for Charles Stuart:"
3223,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"if he were at liberty to-morrow by thy intercession, he would sign thy"
3224,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"death-warrant the day after, for serving the Commonwealth. A"
3225,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,generation of vipers! there is nothing upright nor grateful in them:
3226,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"never was there a drop of even Scotch blood in their veins. Indeed, we"
3227,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"have a clue to their bedchamber still hanging on the door, and I"
3228,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,suspect that an Italian fiddler or French valet has more than once
3229,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,crossed the current.
3230,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3231,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,_Noble._ That may be: nor indeed is it credible that any royal or
3232,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,courtly family has gone on for three generations without a spur from
3233,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,interloper. Look at France! some stout Parisian saint performed the
3234,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,last miracle there.
3235,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3236,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,_Cromwell._ Now thou talkest gravely and sensibly: I could hear thee
3237,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,discourse thus for hours together.
3238,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3239,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_Noble._ Hear me, Cromwell, with equal patience on matters more"
3240,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,important. We all have our sufferings: why increase one another's
3241,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"wantonly? Be the blood Scotch or English, French or Italian, a"
3242,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"drummer's or a buffoon's, it carries a soul upon its stream; and every"
3243,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"soul has many places to touch at, and much business to perform, before"
3244,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,it reaches its ultimate destination. Abolish the power of Charles;
3245,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,extinguish not his virtues. Whatever is worthy to be loved for
3246,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,anything is worthy to be preserved. A wise and dispassionate
3247,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"legislator, if any such should arise among men, will not condemn to"
3248,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"death him who has done, or is likely to do, more service than injury"
3249,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"to society. Blocks and gibbets are the nearest objects to ours, and"
3250,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,their business is never with virtues or with hopes.
3251,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3252,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,_Cromwell._ Walter! Walter! we laugh at speculators.
3253,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3254,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_Noble._ Many indeed are ready enough to laugh at speculators, because"
3255,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"many profit, or expect to profit, by established and widening abuses."
3256,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,Speculations toward evil lose their name by adoption; speculations
3257,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"towards good are for ever speculations, and he who hath proposed them"
3258,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,is a chimerical and silly creature. Among the matters under this
3259,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"denomination I never find a cruel project, I never find an oppressive"
3260,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,or unjust one: how happens it?
3261,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3262,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,_Cromwell._ Proportions should exist in all things. Sovereigns are
3263,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,paid higher than others for their office; they should therefore be
3264,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"punished more severely for abusing it, even if the consequences of"
3265,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,this abuse were in nothing more grievous or extensive. We cannot clap
3266,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"them in the stocks conveniently, nor whip them at the market-place."
3267,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,Where there is a crown there must be an axe: I would keep it there
3268,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,only.
3269,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3270,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_Noble._ Lop off the rotten, press out the poisonous, preserve the"
3271,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,rest; let it suffice to have given this memorable example of national
3272,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,power and justice.
3273,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3274,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,_Cromwell._ Justice is perfect; an attribute of God: we must not
3275,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,trifle with it.
3276,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3277,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,_Noble._ Should we be less merciful to our fellow-creatures than to
3278,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"our domestic animals? Before we deliver them to be killed, we weigh"
3279,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,their services against their inconveniences. On the foundation of
3280,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"policy, when we have no better, let us erect the trophies of humanity:"
3281,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"let us consider that, educated in the same manner and situated in the"
3282,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"same position, we ourselves might have acted as reprovably. Abolish"
3283,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,that for ever which must else for ever generate abuses; and attribute
3284,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"the faults of the man to the office, not the faults of the office to"
3285,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,the man.
3286,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3287,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_Cromwell._ I have no bowels for hypocrisy, and I abominate and detest"
3288,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,kingship.
3289,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3290,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,_Noble._ I abominate and detest hangmanship; but in certain stages of
3291,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,society both are necessary. Let them go together; we want neither now.
3292,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3293,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_Cromwell._ Men, like nails, lose their usefulness when they lose"
3294,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,their direction and begin to bend: such nails are then thrown into the
3295,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,dust or into the furnace. I must do my duty; I must accomplish what is
3296,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,commanded me; I must not be turned aside. I am loath to be cast into
3297,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"the furnace or the dust; but God's will be done! Prithee, Wat, since"
3298,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"thou readest, as I see, the books of philosophers, didst thou ever"
3299,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,hear of Digby's remedies by sympathy?
3300,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3301,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_Noble._ Yes, formerly."
3302,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,
3303,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"_Cromwell._ Well, now, I protest, I do believe there is something in"
3304,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,"them. To cure my headache, I must breathe a vein in the neck of"
3305,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,Charles.
3306,OLIVER CROMWELL AND WALTER NOBLE,

3329,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,Lord Brooke is less known than the personage with whom
3330,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"he converses, and upon whose friendship he had the"

3332,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"On his monument at Warwick, written by himself, we"

3334,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,counsellor of King James and friend of Sir Philip

3336,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,sound and manly.
3337,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,
3338,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"_Brooke._ I come again unto the woods and unto the wilds of Penshurst,"
3339,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,whither my heart and the friend of my heart have long invited me.
3340,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,
3341,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"_Sidney._ Welcome, welcome! And now, Greville, seat yourself under"
3342,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"this oak; since if you had hungered or thirsted from your journey, you"
3343,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,would have renewed the alacrity of your old servants in the hall.
3344,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,
3345,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,_Brooke._ In truth I did; for no otherwise the good household would
3346,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"have it. The birds met me first, affrightened by the tossing up of"
3347,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,caps; and by these harbingers I knew who were coming. When my palfrey
3348,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"eyed them askance for their clamorousness, and shrank somewhat back,"
3349,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"they quarrelled with him almost before they saluted me, and asked him"
3350,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"many pert questions. What a pleasant spot, Sidney, have you chosen"
3351,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,here for meditation! A solitude is the audience-chamber of God. Few
3352,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,days in our year are like this; there is a fresh pleasure in every
3353,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"fresh posture of the limbs, in every turn the eye takes."
3354,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,
3355,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"Youth! credulous of happiness, throw down"
3356,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,Upon this turf thy wallet--stored and swoln

3362,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"It sometimes requires a stout push, and sometimes a sudden resistance,"
3363,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"in the wisest men, not to become for a moment the most foolish. What"
3364,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"have I done? I have fairly challenged you, so much my master."
3365,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,
3366,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,_Sidney._ You have warmed me: I must cool a little and watch my
3367,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"opportunity. So now, Greville, return you to your invitations, and I"
3368,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"will clear the ground for the company; for Youth, for Age, and"
3369,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"whatever comes between, with kindred and dependencies. Verily we need"
3370,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"no taunts like those in your verses: here we have few vices, and"
3371,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,consequently few repinings. I take especial care that my young
3372,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"labourers and farmers shall never be idle, and I supply them with bows"
3373,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"and arrows, with bowls and ninepins, for their Sunday evening,[6]"
3374,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,lest they drink and quarrel. In church they are taught to love God;

3378,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,Goodness does not more certainly make men happy than happiness makes

3385,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,and passive as the ether round the throne of Grace--is made callous
3386,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,and inactive by kneeling too much: her vitality faints under rigorous

3392,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"however, but the tartar that encrusts economy."
3393,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,
3394,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,_Brooke._ Oh that anything so monstrous should exist in this profusion
3395,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"and prodigality of blessings! The herbs, elastic with health, seem to"
3396,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"partake of sensitive and animated life, and to feel under my hand the"
3397,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,benediction I would bestow on them. What a hum of satisfaction in
3398,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"God's creatures! How is it, Sidney, the smallest do seem the happiest?"
3399,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,
3400,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,_Sidney._ Compensation for their weaknesses and their fears;
3401,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,compensation for the shortness of their existence. Their spirits mount
3402,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,upon the sunbeam above the eagle; and they have more enjoyment in
3403,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,their one summer than the elephant in his century.
3404,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,
3405,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,_Brooke._ Are not also the little and lowly in our species the most
3406,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,happy?
3407,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,
3408,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"_Sidney._ I would not willingly try nor over-curiously examine it. We,"
3409,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"Greville, are happy in these parks and forests: we were happy in my"
3410,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,close winter-walk of box and laurustine. In our earlier days did we
3411,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"not emboss our bosoms with the daffodils, and shake them almost unto"
3412,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"shedding with our transport? Ay, my friend, there is a greater"
3413,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"difference, both in the stages of life and in the seasons of the year,"
3414,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,than in the conditions of men: yet the healthy pass through the
3415,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"seasons, from the clement to the inclement, not only unreluctantly"
3416,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"but rejoicingly, knowing that the worst will soon finish, and the best"
3417,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,begin anew; and we are desirous of pushing forward into every stage of
3418,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"life, excepting that alone which ought reasonably to allure us most,"
3419,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"as opening to us the _Via Sacra_, along which we move in triumph to"
3420,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,our eternal country. We may in some measure frame our minds for the
3421,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"reception of happiness, for more or for less; we should, however, well"
3422,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"consider to what port we are steering in search of it, and that even"
3423,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,in the richest its quantity is but too exhaustible. There is a
3424,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"sickliness in the firmest of us, which induceth us to change our side,"
3425,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"though reposing ever so softly: yet, wittingly or unwittingly, we turn"
3426,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,again soon into our old position.
3427,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,
3428,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"God hath granted unto both of us hearts easily contented, hearts"
3429,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"fitted for every station, because fitted for every duty. What appears"
3430,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,the dullest may contribute most to our genius; what is most gloomy may
3431,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,soften the seeds and relax the fibres of gaiety. We enjoy the
3432,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,solemnity of the spreading oak above us: perhaps we owe to it in part
3433,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,the mood of our minds at this instant; perhaps an inanimate thing
3434,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"supplies me, while I am speaking, with whatever I possess of"
3435,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,animation. Do you imagine that any contest of shepherds can afford
3436,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,them the same pleasure as I receive from the description of it; or
3437,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"that even in their loves, however innocent and faithful, they are so"
3438,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,free from anxiety as I am while I celebrate them? The exertion of
3439,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"intellectual power, of fancy and imagination, keeps from us greatly"
3440,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"more than their wretchedness, and affords us greatly more than their"
3441,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,enjoyment. We are motes in the midst of generations: we have our
3442,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,sunbeams to circuit and climb. Look at the summits of the trees around
3443,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"us, how they move, and the loftiest the most: nothing is at rest"
3444,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"within the compass of our view, except the grey moss on the"
3445,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"park-pales. Let it eat away the dead oak, but let it not be compared"
3446,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,with the living one.
3447,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,
3448,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,Poets are in general prone to melancholy; yet the most plaintive ditty
3449,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"hath imparted a fuller joy, and of longer duration, to its composer,"
3450,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,than the conquest of Persia to the Macedonian. A bottle of wine
3451,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"bringeth as much pleasure as the acquisition of a kingdom, and not"
3452,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,unlike it in kind: the senses in both cases are confused and
3453,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,perverted.
3454,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,
3455,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,_Brooke._ Merciful Heaven! and for the fruition of an hour's
3456,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"drunkenness, from which they must awaken with heaviness, pain, and"
3457,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"terror, men consume a whole crop of their kind at one harvest home."
3458,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,Shame upon those light ones who carol at the feast of blood! and worse
3459,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,upon those graver ones who nail upon their escutcheon the name of
3460,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,great! Ambition is but Avarice on stilts and masked. God sometimes
3461,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"sends a famine, sometimes a pestilence, and sometimes a hero, for the"
3462,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,chastisement of mankind; none of them surely for our admiration. Only
3463,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,some cause like unto that which is now scattering the mental fog of
3464,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"the Netherlands, and is preparing them for the fruits of freedom, can"
3465,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,justify us in drawing the sword abroad.
3466,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,
3467,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,_Sidney._ And only the accomplishment of our purpose can permit us
3468,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,again to sheathe it; for the aggrandizement of our neighbour is nought
3469,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"of detriment to us: on the contrary, if we are honest and industrious,"
3470,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,his wealth is ours. We have nothing to dread while our laws are
3471,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,equitable and our impositions light: but children fly from mothers who
3472,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,strip and scourge them.
3473,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,
3474,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,_Brooke._ We are come to an age when we ought to read and speak
3475,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,plainly what our discretion tells us is fit: we are not to be set in a
3476,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,"corner for mockery and derision, with our hands hanging down"
3477,LORD BROOKE AND SIR PHILIP SIDNEY,motionless and our pockets turned inside out.

3499,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,freedom with which I have spoken of your poetry and Wordsworth's.
3500,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3501,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"_Southey._ What could have induced you to imagine it, Mr. Professor?"
3502,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"You have indeed bent your eyes upon me, since we have been together,"
3503,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,with somewhat of fierceness and defiance: I presume you fancied me to
3504,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,be a commentator. You wrong me in your belief that any opinion on my
3505,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,poetical works hath molested me; but you afford me more than
3506,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,compensation in supposing me acutely sensible of injustice done to
3507,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"Wordsworth. If we must converse on these topics, we will converse on"
3508,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"him. What man ever existed who spent a more inoffensive life, or"
3509,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,adorned it with nobler studies?
3510,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3511,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,_Porson._ I believe so; and they who attack him with virulence are men
3512,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,of as little morality as reflection. I have demonstrated that one of
3513,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"them, he who wrote the _Pursuits of Literature_, could not construe a"
3514,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,Greek sentence or scan a verse; and I have fallen on the very _Index_
3515,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,from which he drew out his forlorn hope on the parade. This is
3516,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,incomparably the most impudent fellow I have met with in the course of
3517,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"my reading, which has lain, you know, in a province where impudence is"

3522,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,I had visited a friend in _King's Road_ when he entered.
3523,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3524,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,'Have you seen the _Review_?' cried he. 'Worse than ever! I am
3525,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"resolved to insert a paragraph in the papers, declaring that I had no"
3526,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,concern in the last number.'
3527,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3528,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"'Is it so very bad?' said I, quietly."
3529,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3530,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,'Infamous! detestable!' exclaimed he.
3531,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3532,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"'Sit down, then: nobody will believe you,' was my answer."
3533,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3534,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"Since that morning he has discovered that I drink harder than usual,"
3535,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"that my faculties are wearing fast away, that once, indeed, I had some"
3536,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"Greek in my head, but--he then claps the forefinger to the side of his"
3537,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"nose, turns his eye slowly upward, and looks compassionately and"
3538,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,calmly.
3539,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3540,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"_Southey._ Come, Mr. Porson, grant him his merits: no critic is better"
3541,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"contrived to make any work a monthly one, no writer more dexterous in"
3542,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,giving a finishing touch.
3543,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3544,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,_Porson._ The plagiary has a greater latitude of choice than we; and
3545,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"if he brings home a parsnip or turnip-top, when he could as easily"
3546,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"have pocketed a nectarine or a pineapple, he must be a blockhead. I"
3547,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"never heard the name of the _Pursuer of Literature_, who has little"
3548,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,more merit in having stolen than he would have had if he had never
3549,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"stolen at all; and I have forgotten that other man's, who evinced his"
3550,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"fitness to be the censor of our age, by a translation of the most"
3551,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"naked and impure satires of antiquity--those of Juvenal, which owe"
3552,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,their preservation to the partiality of the friars. I shall entertain
3553,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"an unfavourable opinion of him if he has translated them well: pray,"
3554,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,has he?
3555,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3556,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"_Southey._ Indeed, I do not know. I read poets for their poetry, and"
3557,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,to extract that nutriment of the intellect and of the heart which
3558,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"poetry should contain. I never listen to the swans of the cesspool,"
3559,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,and must declare that nothing is heavier to me than rottenness and
3560,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,corruption.
3561,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3562,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"_Porson._ You are right, sir, perfectly right. A translator of Juvenal"
3563,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"would open a public drain to look for a needle, and may miss it. My"
3564,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,nose is not easily offended; but I must have something to fill my
3565,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"belly. Come, we will lay aside the scrip of the transpositor and the"
3566,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"pouch of the pursuer, in reserve for the days of unleavened bread;"
3567,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"and again, if you please, to the lakes and mountains. Now we are both"
3568,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"in better humour, I must bring you to a confession that in your friend"
3569,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,Wordsworth there is occasionally a little trash.
3570,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3571,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"_Southey._ A haunch of venison would be trash to a Brahmin, a bottle"
3572,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"of Burgundy to the xerif of Mecca. We are guided by precept, by habit,"
3573,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"by taste, by constitution. Hitherto our sentiments on poetry have been"
3574,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"delivered down to us from authority; and if it can be demonstrated, as"
3575,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"I think it may be, that the authority is inadequate, and that the"
3576,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"dictates are often inapplicable and often misinterpreted, you will"
3577,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,allow me to remove the cause out of court. Every man can see what is
3578,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,very bad in a poem; almost every one can see what is very good: but
3579,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"you, Mr. Porson, who have turned over all the volumes of all the"
3580,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"commentators, will inform me whether I am right or wrong in asserting"
3581,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,that no critic hath yet appeared who hath been able to fix or to
3582,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,discern the exact degrees of excellence above a certain point.
3583,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3584,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,_Porson._ None.
3585,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3586,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"_Southey._ The reason is, because the eyes of no one have been upon a"
3587,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"level with it. Supposing, for the sake of argument, the contest of"
3588,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,Hesiod and Homer to have taken place: the judges who decided in favour
3589,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"of the worse, and he, indeed, in poetry has little merit, may have"
3590,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"been elegant, wise, and conscientious men. Their decision was in"
3591,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,favour of that to the species of which they had been the most
3592,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"accustomed. Corinna was preferred to Pindar no fewer than five times,"
3593,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,and the best judges in Greece gave her the preference; yet whatever
3594,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"were her powers, and beyond a question they were extraordinary, we may"
3595,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,assure ourselves that she stood many degrees below Pindar. Nothing is
3596,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,more absurd than the report that the judges were prepossessed by her
3597,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"beauty. Plutarch tells us that she was much older than her competitor,"
3598,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"who consulted her judgment in his earlier odes. Now, granting their"
3599,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"first competition to have been when Pindar was twenty years old, and"
3600,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"that the others were in the years succeeding, her beauty must have"
3601,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,been somewhat on the decline; for in Greece there are few women who
3602,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"retain the graces, none who retain the bloom of youth, beyond the"
3603,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"twenty-third year. Her countenance, I doubt not, was expressive: but"
3604,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"expression, although it gives beauty to men, makes women pay dearly"
3605,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"for its stamp, and pay soon. Nature seems, in protection to their"
3606,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"loveliness, to have ordered that they who are our superiors in"
3607,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,quickness and sensibility should be little disposed to laborious
3608,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"thought, or to long excursions in the labyrinths of fancy. We may be"
3609,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,convinced that the verdict of the judges was biased by nothing else
3610,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"than the habitudes of thinking; we may be convinced, too, that living"
3611,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"in an age when poetry was cultivated highly, and selected from the"
3612,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"most acute and the most dispassionate, they were subject to no greater"
3613,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,errors of opinion than are the learned messmates of our English
3614,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,colleges.
3615,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3616,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,_Porson._ You are more liberal in your largesses to the fair Greeks
3617,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"than a friend of mine was, who resided in Athens to acquire the"
3618,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"language. He assured me that beauty there was in bud at thirteen, in"
3619,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"full blossom at fifteen, losing a leaf or two every day at seventeen,"
3620,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"trembling on the thorn at nineteen, and under the tree at twenty."
3621,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3622,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"_Southey._ Mr. Porson, it does not appear to me that anything more is"
3623,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"necessary, in the first instance, than to interrogate our hearts in"
3624,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,what manner they have been affected. If the ear is satisfied; if at
3625,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"one moment a tumult is aroused in the breast, and tranquillized at"
3626,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"another, with a perfect consciousness of equal power exerted in both"
3627,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,cases; if we rise up from the perusal of the work with a strong
3628,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"excitement to thought, to imagination, to sensibility; above all, if"
3629,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"we sat down with some propensities toward evil, and walk away with"
3630,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"much stronger toward good, in the midst of a world which we never had"
3631,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,entered and of which we never had dreamed before--shall we perversely
3632,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"put on again the _old man_ of criticism, and dissemble that we have"
3633,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,been conducted by a most beneficent and most potent genius? Nothing
3634,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,proves to me so manifestly in what a pestiferous condition are its
3635,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"lazarettos, as when I observe how little hath been objected against"
3636,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"those who have substituted words for things, and how much against"
3637,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,those who have reinstated things for words.
3638,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3639,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,Let Wordsworth prove to the world that there may be animation without
3640,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"blood and broken bones, and tenderness remote from the stews. Some"
3641,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,will doubt it; for even things the most evident are often but little
3642,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,perceived and strangely estimated. Swift ridiculed the music of Handel
3643,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,and the generalship of Marlborough; Pope the perspicacity and the
3644,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,scholarship of Bentley; Gray the abilities of Shaftesbury and the
3645,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,eloquence of Rousseau. Shakespeare hardly found those who would
3646,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,collect his tragedies; Milton was read from godliness; Virgil was
3647,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"antiquated and rustic; Cicero, Asiatic. What a rabble has persecuted"
3648,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,my friend! An elephant is born to be consumed by ants in the midst of
3649,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,his unapproachable solitudes: Wordsworth is the prey of Jeffrey. Why
3650,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"repine? Let us rather amuse ourselves with allegories, and recollect"
3651,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,that God in the creation left His noblest creature at the mercy of a
3652,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,serpent.

3655,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3656,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,_Porson._ Wordsworth goes out of his way to be attacked; he picks up a
3657,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"piece of dirt, throws it on the carpet in the midst of the company,"
3658,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"and cries, _This is a better man than any of you!_ He does indeed"
3659,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,mould the base material into what form he chooses; but why not rather
3660,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,invite us to contemplate it than challenge us to condemn it? Here
3661,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,surely is false taste.
3662,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3663,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,_Southey._ The principal and the most general accusation against him
3664,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"is, that the vehicle of his thoughts is unequal to them. Now did ever"
3665,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,the judges at the Olympic games say: 'We would have awarded to you the
3666,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"meed of victory, if your chariot had been equal to your horses: it is"
3667,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,true they have won; but the people are displeased at a car neither new
3668,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"nor richly gilt, and without a gryphon or sphinx engraved on the"
3669,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,axle'? You admire simplicity in Euripides; you censure it in
3670,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"Wordsworth: believe me, sir, it arises in neither from penury of"
3671,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,thought--which seldom has produced it--but from the strength of
3672,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"temperance, and at the suggestion of principle."
3673,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3674,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"Take up a poem of Wordsworth's and read it--I would rather say, read"
3675,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"them all; and, knowing that a mind like yours must grasp closely what"
3676,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"comes within it, I will then appeal to you whether any poet of our"
3677,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"country, since Milton, hath exerted greater powers with less of strain"
3678,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,"and less of ostentation. I would, however, by his permission, lay"

3684,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,
3685,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,_Southey._ Whom did they imitate? If his genius is equal to theirs he
3686,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,has no need of a guide. He also will be an ancient; and the very
3687,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,counterparts of those who now decry him will extol him a thousand
3688,SOUTHEY AND PORSON,years hence in malignity to the moderns.

3696,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"The Abb√© Delille was the happiest of creatures, when he could weep"
3697,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,over the charms of innocence and the country in some crowded and
3698,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,fashionable circle at Paris. We embraced most pathetically on our
3699,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"first meeting there, as if the one were condemned to quit the earth,"
3700,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,the other to live upon it.
3701,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,
3702,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,_Delille._ You are reported to have said that descriptive poetry has
3703,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,all the merits of a handkerchief that smells of roses?
3704,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,
3705,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"_Landor._ This, if I said it, is among the things which are neither"
3706,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,false enough nor true enough to be displeasing. But the Abb√© Delille
3707,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,has merits of his own. To translate Milton well is more laudable than
3708,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,originality in trifling matters; just as to transport an obelisk from
3709,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"Egypt, and to erect it in one of the squares, must be considered a"
3710,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,greater labour than to build a new chandler's shop.
3711,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,
3712,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"_Delille._ Milton is indeed extremely difficult to translate; for,"
3713,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"however noble and majestic, he is sometimes heavy, and often rough and"
3714,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,unequal.
3715,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,
3716,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"_Landor._ Dear Abb√©, porphyry is heavy, gold is heavier; Ossa and"
3717,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"Olympus are rough and unequal; the steppes of Tartary, though high,"
3718,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"are of uniform elevation: there is not a rock, nor a birch, nor a"
3719,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"cytisus, nor an arbutus upon them great enough to shelter a"
3720,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"new-dropped lamb. Level the Alps one with another, and where is their"
3721,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"sublimity? Raise up the vale of Tempe to the downs above, and where"
3722,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,are those sylvan creeks and harbours in which the imagination watches
3723,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,while the soul reposes; those recesses in which the gods partook the
3724,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"weaknesses of mortals, and mortals the enjoyments of the gods?"
3725,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,
3726,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,You have treated our poet with courtesy and distinction; in your
3727,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"trimmed and measured dress, he might be taken for a Frenchman. Do not"
3728,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"think me flattering. You have conducted Eve from Paradise to Paris,"
3729,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,and she really looks prettier and smarter than before she tripped.
3730,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,With what elegance she rises from a most awful dream! You represent
3731,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"her (I repeat your expression) as springing up _en sursaut_, as if"
3732,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,you had caught her asleep and tickled the young creature on that sofa.
3733,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,
3734,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,Homer and Virgil have been excelled in sublimity by Shakespeare and
3735,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"Milton, as the Caucasus and Atlas of the old world by the Andes and"
3736,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,Teneriffe of the new; but you would embellish them all.
3737,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,
3738,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,_Delille._ I owe to Voltaire my first sentiment of admiration for
3739,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,Milton and Shakespeare.
3740,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,
3741,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"_Landor._ He stuck to them as a woodpecker to an old forest-tree, only"
3742,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,for the purpose of picking out what was rotten: he has made the holes
3743,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"deeper than he found them, and, after all his cries and chatter, has"
3744,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,brought home but scanty sustenance to his starveling nest.
3745,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,
3746,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,_Delille._ You must acknowledge that there are fine verses in his
3747,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,tragedies.
3748,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,
3749,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"_Landor._ Whenever such is the first observation, be assured, M."
3750,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"l'Abb√©, that the poem, if heroic or dramatic, is bad. Should a work of"
3751,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"this kind be excellent, we say, 'How admirably the characters are"
3752,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,sustained! What delicacy of discrimination! There is nothing to be
3753,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,taken away or altered without an injury to the part or to the whole.'
3754,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"We may afterward descend on the versification. In poetry, there is a"
3755,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,greater difference between the good and the excellent than there is
3756,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,between the bad and the good. Poetry has no golden mean; mediocrity
3757,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"here is of another metal, which Voltaire, however, had skill enough to"
3758,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"encrust and polish. In the least wretched of his tragedies, whatever"
3759,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"is tolerable is Shakespeare's; but, gracious Heaven! how deteriorated!"
3760,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"When he pretends to extol a poet he chooses some defective part, and"
3761,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,renders it more so whenever he translates it. I will repeat a few
3762,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,verses from Metastasio in support of my assertion. Metastasio was both
3763,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"a better critic and a better poet, although of the second order in"
3764,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"each quality; his tyrants are less philosophical, and his chambermaids"
3765,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"less dogmatic. Voltaire was, however, a man of abilities, and author"
3766,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"of many passable epigrams, beside those which are contained in his"
3767,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"tragedies and heroics; yet it must be confessed that, like your"
3768,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"Parisian lackeys, they are usually the smartest when out of place."
3769,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,
3770,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,"_Delille._ What you call epigram gives life and spirit to grave works,"
3771,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,and seems principally wanted to relieve a long poem. I do not see why
3772,THE ABB√â DELILLE AND WALTER LANDOR,what pleases us in a star should not please us in a constellation.

3778,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3779,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3780,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ Stop! stop! come hither! Why lookest thou so scornfully
3781,DIOGENES AND PLATO,and askance upon me?
3782,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3783,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ Let me go! loose me! I am resolved to pass.
3784,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3785,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Nay, then, by Jupiter and this tub! thou leavest three"
3786,DIOGENES AND PLATO,good ells of Milesian cloth behind thee. Whither wouldst thou amble?
3787,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3788,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ I am not obliged in courtesy to tell you.
3789,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3790,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ Upon whose errand? Answer me directly.
3791,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3792,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ Upon my own.
3793,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3794,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Oh, then, I will hold thee yet awhile. If it were upon"
3795,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"another's, it might be a hardship to a good citizen, though not to a"
3796,DIOGENES AND PLATO,good philosopher.
3797,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3798,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ That can be no impediment to my release: you do not think me
3799,DIOGENES AND PLATO,one.
3800,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3801,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ No, by my Father Jove!"
3802,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3803,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ Your father!
3804,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3805,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ Why not? Thou shouldst be the last man to doubt it. Hast
3806,DIOGENES AND PLATO,not thou declared it irrational to refuse our belief to those who
3807,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"assert that they are begotten by the gods, though the assertion (these"
3808,DIOGENES AND PLATO,are thy words) be unfounded on reason or probability? In me there is a
3809,DIOGENES AND PLATO,chance of it: whereas in the generation of such people as thou art
3810,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"fondest of frequenting, who claim it loudly, there are always too many"
3811,DIOGENES AND PLATO,competitors to leave it probable.
3812,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3813,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ Those who speak against the great do not usually speak from
3814,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"morality, but from envy."
3815,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3816,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Thou hast a glimpse of the truth in this place, but as"
3817,DIOGENES AND PLATO,thou hast already shown thy ignorance in attempting to prove to me
3818,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"what a _man_ is, ill can I expect to learn from thee what is a _great"
3819,DIOGENES AND PLATO,man_.
3820,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3821,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ No doubt your experience and intercourse will afford me the
3822,DIOGENES AND PLATO,information.
3823,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3824,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Attend, and take it. The great man is he who hath nothing"
3825,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"to fear and nothing to hope from another. It is he who, while he"
3826,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"demonstrates the iniquity of the laws, and is able to correct them,"
3827,DIOGENES AND PLATO,obeys them peaceably. It is he who looks on the ambitious both as weak
3828,DIOGENES AND PLATO,and fraudulent. It is he who hath no disposition or occasion for any
3829,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"kind of deceit, no reason for being or for appearing different from"
3830,DIOGENES AND PLATO,what he is. It is he who can call together the most select company
3831,DIOGENES AND PLATO,when it pleases him.
3832,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3833,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ Excuse my interruption. In the beginning of your definition I
3834,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"fancied that you were designating your own person, as most people do"
3835,DIOGENES AND PLATO,in describing what is admirable; now I find that you have some other
3836,DIOGENES AND PLATO,in contemplation.
3837,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3838,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ I thank thee for allowing me what perhaps I _do_ possess,"
3839,DIOGENES AND PLATO,but what I was not then thinking of; as is often the case with rich
3840,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"possessors: in fact, the latter part of the description suits me as"
3841,DIOGENES AND PLATO,well as any portion of the former.
3842,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3843,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ You may call together the best company, by using your hands"
3844,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"in the call, as you did with me; otherwise I am not sure that you"
3845,DIOGENES AND PLATO,would succeed in it.
3846,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3847,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ My thoughts are my company; I can bring them together,"
3848,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"select them, detain them, dismiss them. Imbecile and vicious men"
3849,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"cannot do any of these things. Their thoughts are scattered, vague,"
3850,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"uncertain, cumbersome: and the worst stick to them the longest; many"
3851,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"indeed by choice, the greater part by necessity, and accompanied, some"
3852,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"by weak wishes, others by vain remorse."
3853,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3854,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ Is there nothing of greatness, O Diogenes! in exhibiting how"
3855,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"cities and communities may be governed best, how morals may be kept"
3856,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"the purest, and power become the most stable?"
3857,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3858,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ _Something_ of greatness does not constitute the great
3859,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"man. Let me, however, see him who hath done what thou sayest: he must"
3860,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"be the most universal and the most indefatigable traveller, he must"
3861,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"also be the oldest creature, upon earth."
3862,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3863,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ How so?
3864,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3865,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Because he must know perfectly the climate, the soil, the"
3866,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"situation, the peculiarities, of the races, of their allies, of their"
3867,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"enemies; he must have sounded their harbours, he must have measured"
3868,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"the quantity of their arable land and pasture, of their woods and"
3869,DIOGENES AND PLATO,mountains; he must have ascertained whether there are fisheries on
3870,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"their coasts, and even what winds are prevalent. On these causes, with"
3871,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"some others, depend the bodily strength, the numbers, the wealth, the"
3872,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"wants, the capacities of the people."
3873,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3874,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ Such are low thoughts.
3875,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3876,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ The bird of wisdom flies low, and seeks her food under"
3877,DIOGENES AND PLATO,hedges: the eagle himself would be starved if he always soared aloft
3878,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"and against the sun. The sweetest fruit grows near the ground, and the"
3879,DIOGENES AND PLATO,plants that bear it require ventilation and lopping. Were this not to
3880,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"be done in thy garden, every walk and alley, every plot and border,"
3881,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"would be covered with runners and roots, with boughs and suckers. We"
3882,DIOGENES AND PLATO,want no poets or logicians or metaphysicians to govern us: we want
3883,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"practical men, honest men, continent men, unambitious men, fearful to"
3884,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"solicit a trust, slow to accept, and resolute never to betray one."
3885,DIOGENES AND PLATO,Experimentalists may be the best philosophers: they are always the
3886,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"worst politicians. Teach people their duties, and they will know their"
3887,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"interests. Change as little as possible, and correct as much."
3888,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3889,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"Philosophers are absurd from many causes, but principally from laying"
3890,DIOGENES AND PLATO,out unthriftily their distinctions. They set up four virtues:
3891,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"fortitude, prudence, temperance, and justice. Now a man may be a very"
3892,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"bad one, and yet possess three out of the four. Every cut-throat must,"
3893,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"if he has been a cut-throat on many occasions, have more fortitude and"
3894,DIOGENES AND PLATO,more prudence than the greater part of those whom we consider as the
3895,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"best men. And what cruel wretches, both executioners and judges, have"
3896,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"been strictly just! how little have they cared what gentleness, what"
3897,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"generosity, what genius, their sentence hath removed from the earth!"
3898,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"Temperance and beneficence contain all other virtues. Take them home,"
3899,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"Plato; split them, expound them; do what thou wilt with them, if thou"
3900,DIOGENES AND PLATO,but use them.
3901,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3902,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"Before I gave thee this lesson, which is a better than thou ever"
3903,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"gavest any one, and easier to remember, thou wert accusing me of"
3904,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"invidiousness and malice against those whom thou callest the great,"
3905,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"meaning to say the powerful. Thy imagination, I am well aware, had"
3906,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"taken its flight toward Sicily, where thou seekest thy great man, as"
3907,DIOGENES AND PLATO,earnestly and undoubtingly as Ceres sought her Persephone. Faith!
3908,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"honest Plato, I have no reason to envy thy worthy friend Dionysius."
3909,DIOGENES AND PLATO,Look at my nose! A lad seven or eight years old threw an apple at me
3910,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"yesterday, while I was gazing at the clouds, and gave me nose enough"
3911,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"for two moderate men. Instead of such a godsend, what should I have"
3912,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"thought of my fortune, if, after living all my lifetime among golden"
3913,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"vases, rougher than my hand with their emeralds and rubies, their"
3914,DIOGENES AND PLATO,engravings and embossments; among Parian caryatides and porphyry
3915,DIOGENES AND PLATO,sphinxes; among philosophers with rings upon their fingers and linen
3916,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"next their skin; and among singing-boys and dancing-girls, to whom"
3917,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"alone thou speakest intelligibly--I ask thee again, what should I in"
3918,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"reason have thought of my fortune, if, after these facilities and"
3919,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"superfluities, I had at last been pelted out of my house, not by one"
3920,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"young rogue, but by thousands of all ages, and not with an apple (I"
3921,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"wish I could say a rotten one), but with pebbles and broken pots; and,"
3922,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"to crown my deserts, had been compelled to become the teacher of so"
3923,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"promising a generation? Great men, forsooth! thou knowest at last who"
3924,DIOGENES AND PLATO,they are.
3925,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3926,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ There are great men of various kinds.
3927,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3928,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ No, by my beard, are there not!"
3929,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3930,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ What! are there not great captains, great geometricians,"
3931,DIOGENES AND PLATO,great dialectitians?
3932,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3933,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ Who denied it? A great man was the postulate. Try thy hand
3934,DIOGENES AND PLATO,now at the powerful one.
3935,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3936,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ On seeing the exercise of power, a child cannot doubt who is"
3937,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"powerful, more or less; for power is relative. All men are weak, not"
3938,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"only if compared to the Demiurgos, but if compared to the sea or the"
3939,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"earth, or certain things upon each of them, such as elephants and"
3940,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"whales. So placid and tranquil is the scene around us, we can hardly"
3941,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"bring to mind the images of strength and force, the precipices, the"
3942,DIOGENES AND PLATO,abysses----
3943,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3944,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Prithee hold thy loose tongue, twinkling and glittering"
3945,DIOGENES AND PLATO,like a serpent's in the midst of luxuriance and rankness! Did never
3946,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"this reflection of thine warn thee that, in human life, the precipices"
3947,DIOGENES AND PLATO,and abysses would be much farther from our admiration if we were less
3948,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"inconsiderate, selfish, and vile? I will not however stop thee long,"
3949,DIOGENES AND PLATO,for thou wert going on quite consistently. As thy great men are
3950,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"fighters and wranglers, so thy mighty things upon the earth and sea"
3951,DIOGENES AND PLATO,are troublesome and intractable encumbrances. Thou perceivedst not
3952,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"what was greater in the former case, neither art thou aware what is"
3953,DIOGENES AND PLATO,greater in this. Didst thou feel the gentle air that passed us?
3954,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3955,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ I did not, just then."
3956,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3957,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ That air, so gentle, so imperceptible to thee, is more"
3958,DIOGENES AND PLATO,powerful not only than all the creatures that breathe and live by it;
3959,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"not only than all the oaks of the forest, which it rears in an age and"
3960,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"shatters in a moment; not only than all the monsters of the sea, but"
3961,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"than the sea itself, which it tosses up into foam, and breaks against"
3962,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"every rock in its vast circumference; for it carries in its bosom,"
3963,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"with perfect calm and composure, the incontrollable ocean and the"
3964,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"peopled earth, like an atom of a feather."
3965,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3966,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"To the world's turmoils and pageantries is attracted, not only the"
3967,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"admiration of the populace, but the zeal of the orator, the enthusiasm"
3968,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"of the poet, the investigation of the historian, and the contemplation"
3969,DIOGENES AND PLATO,of the philosopher: yet how silent and invisible are they in the
3970,DIOGENES AND PLATO,depths of air! Do I say in those depths and deserts? No; I say in the
3971,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"distance of a swallow's flight--at the distance she rises above us,"
3972,DIOGENES AND PLATO,ere a sentence brief as this could be uttered.
3973,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3974,DIOGENES AND PLATO,What are its mines and mountains? Fragments welded up and dislocated
3975,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"by the expansion of water from below; the most part reduced to mud,"
3976,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"the rest to splinters. Afterwards sprang up fire in many places, and"
3977,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"again tore and mangled the mutilated carcass, and still growls over"
3978,DIOGENES AND PLATO,it.
3979,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3980,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"What are its cities and ramparts, and moles and monuments? Segments of"
3981,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"a fragment, which one man puts together and another throws down. Here"
3982,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"we stumble upon thy great ones at their work. Show me now, if thou"
3983,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"canst, in history, three great warriors, or three great statesmen, who"
3984,DIOGENES AND PLATO,have acted otherwise than spiteful children.
3985,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3986,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ I will begin to look for them in history when I have
3987,DIOGENES AND PLATO,discovered the same number in the philosophers or the poets. A prudent
3988,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"man searches in his own garden after the plant he wants, before he"
3989,DIOGENES AND PLATO,casts his eyes over the stalls in Kenkrea or Keramicos.
3990,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
3991,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"Returning to your observation on the potency of the air, I am not"
3992,DIOGENES AND PLATO,ignorant or unmindful of it. May I venture to express my opinion to
3993,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"you, Diogenes, that the earlier discoverers and distributors of wisdom"
3994,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"(which wisdom lies among us in ruins and remnants, partly distorted"
3995,DIOGENES AND PLATO,and partly concealed by theological allegory) meant by Jupiter the air
3996,DIOGENES AND PLATO,in its agitated state; by Juno the air in its quiescent. These are the
3997,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"great agents, and therefore called the king and queen of the gods."
3998,DIOGENES AND PLATO,Jupiter is denominated by Homer the _compeller of clouds_: Juno
3999,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"receives them, and remits them in showers to plants and animals."
4000,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4001,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"I may trust you, I hope, O Diogenes?"
4002,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4003,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Thou mayest lower the gods in my presence, as safely as"
4004,DIOGENES AND PLATO,men in the presence of Timon.
4005,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4006,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ I would not lower them: I would exalt them.
4007,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4008,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ More foolish and presumptuous still!
4009,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4010,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ Fair words, O Sinopean! I protest to you my aim is truth."
4011,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4012,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ I cannot lead thee where of a certainty thou mayest always
4013,DIOGENES AND PLATO,find it; but I will tell thee what it is. Truth is a point; the
4014,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"subtilest and finest; harder than adamant; never to be broken, worn"
4015,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"away, or blunted. Its only bad quality is, that it is sure to hurt"
4016,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"those who touch it; and likely to draw blood, perhaps the life-blood,"
4017,DIOGENES AND PLATO,of those who press earnestly upon it. Let us away from this narrow
4018,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"lane skirted with hemlock, and pursue our road again through the wind"
4019,DIOGENES AND PLATO,and dust toward the _great_ man and the _powerful_. Him I would call
4020,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"the powerful one who controls the storms of his mind, and turns to"
4021,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"good account the worst accidents of his fortune. The great man, I was"
4022,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"going on to demonstrate, is somewhat more. He must be able to do this,"
4023,DIOGENES AND PLATO,and he must have an intellect which puts into motion the intellect of
4024,DIOGENES AND PLATO,others.
4025,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4026,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ Socrates, then, was your great man."
4027,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4028,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ He was indeed; nor can all thou hast attributed to him
4029,DIOGENES AND PLATO,ever make me think the contrary. I wish he could have kept a little
4030,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"more at home, and have thought it as well worth his while to converse"
4031,DIOGENES AND PLATO,with his own children as with others.
4032,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4033,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ He knew himself born for the benefit of the human race.
4034,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4035,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ Those who are born for the benefit of the human race go
4036,DIOGENES AND PLATO,but little into it: those who are born for its curse are crowded.
4037,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4038,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ It was requisite to dispel the mists of ignorance and error.
4039,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4040,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Has he done it? What doubt has he elucidated, or what fact"
4041,DIOGENES AND PLATO,has he established? Although I was but twelve years old and resident
4042,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"in another city when he died, I have taken some pains in my inquiries"
4043,DIOGENES AND PLATO,about him from persons of less vanity and less perverseness than his
4044,DIOGENES AND PLATO,disciples. He did not leave behind him any true philosopher among
4045,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"them; any who followed his mode of argumentation, his subjects of"
4046,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"disquisition, or his course of life; any who would subdue the"
4047,DIOGENES AND PLATO,malignant passions or coerce the looser; any who would abstain from
4048,DIOGENES AND PLATO,calumny or from cavil; any who would devote his days to the glory of
4049,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"his country, or, what is easier and perhaps wiser, to his own"
4050,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"well-founded contentment and well-merited repose. Xenophon, the best"
4051,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"of them, offered up sacrifices, believed in oracles, consulted"
4052,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"soothsayers, turned pale at a jay, and was dysenteric at a magpie."
4053,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4054,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ He had courage at least.
4055,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4056,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ His courage was of so strange a quality, that he was"
4057,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"ready, if jay or magpie did not cross him, to fight for Spartan or"
4058,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"Persian. Plato, whom thou esteemest much, and knowest somewhat less,"
4059,DIOGENES AND PLATO,careth as little for portent and omen as doth Diogenes. What he would
4060,DIOGENES AND PLATO,have done for a Persian I cannot say; certain I am that he would have
4061,DIOGENES AND PLATO,no more fought for a Spartan than he would for his own father: yet he
4062,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"mortally hates the man who hath a kinder muse or a better milliner, or"
4063,DIOGENES AND PLATO,a seat nearer the minion of a king. So much for the two disciples of
4064,DIOGENES AND PLATO,Socrates who have acquired the greatest celebrity!
4065,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4066,DIOGENES AND PLATO,*       *       *       *       *
4067,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4068,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ Diogenes! if you must argue or discourse with me, I will"
4069,DIOGENES AND PLATO,endure your asperity for the sake of your acuteness; but it appears to
4070,DIOGENES AND PLATO,me a more philosophical thing to avoid what is insulting and
4071,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"vexatious, than to breast and brave it."
4072,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4073,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ Thou hast spoken well.
4074,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4075,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ It belongs to the vulgar, not to us, to fly from a man's"
4076,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"opinions to his actions, and to stab him in his own house for having"
4077,DIOGENES AND PLATO,received no wound in the school. One merit you will allow me: I always
4078,DIOGENES AND PLATO,keep my temper; which you seldom do.
4079,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4080,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ Is mine a good or a bad one?
4081,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4082,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ Now, must I speak sincerely?"
4083,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4084,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Dost thou, a philosopher, ask such a question of me, a"
4085,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"philosopher? Ay, sincerely or not at all."
4086,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4087,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ Sincerely as you could wish, I must declare, then, your"
4088,DIOGENES AND PLATO,temper is the worst in the world.
4089,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4090,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ I am much in the right, therefore, not to keep it. Embrace"
4091,DIOGENES AND PLATO,me: I have spoken now in thy own manner. Because thou sayest the most
4092,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"malicious things the most placidly, thou thinkest or pretendest thou"
4093,DIOGENES AND PLATO,art sincere.
4094,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4095,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ Certainly those who are most the masters of their resentments
4096,DIOGENES AND PLATO,are likely to speak less erroneously than the passionate and morose.
4097,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4098,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ If they would, they might; but the moderate are not"
4099,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"usually the most sincere, for the same circumspection which makes them"
4100,DIOGENES AND PLATO,moderate makes them likewise retentive of what could give offence:
4101,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"they are also timid in regard to fortune and favour, and hazard"
4102,DIOGENES AND PLATO,little. There is no mass of sincerity in any place. What there is must
4103,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"be picked up patiently, a grain or two at a time; and the season for"
4104,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"it is after a storm, after the overflowing of banks, and bursting of"
4105,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"mounds, and sweeping away of landmarks. Men will always hold something"
4106,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"back; they must be shaken and loosened a little, to make them let go"
4107,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"what is deepest in them, and weightiest and purest."
4108,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4109,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ Shaking and loosening as much about you as was requisite for
4110,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"the occasion, it became you to demonstrate where and in what manner I"
4111,DIOGENES AND PLATO,had made Socrates appear less sagacious and less eloquent than he was;
4112,DIOGENES AND PLATO,it became you likewise to consider the great difficulty of finding new
4113,DIOGENES AND PLATO,thoughts and new expressions for those who had more of them than any
4114,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"other men, and to represent them in all the brilliancy of their wit"
4115,DIOGENES AND PLATO,and in all the majesty of their genius. I do not assert that I have
4116,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"done it; but if I have not, what man has? what man has come so nigh to"
4117,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"it? He who could bring Socrates, or Solon, or Diogenes through a"
4118,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"dialogue, without disparagement, is much nearer in his intellectual"
4119,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"powers to them, than any other is near to him."
4120,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4121,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Let Diogenes alone, and Socrates, and Solon. None of the"
4122,DIOGENES AND PLATO,three ever occupied his hours in tingeing and curling the tarnished
4123,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"plumes of prostitute Philosophy, or deemed anything worth his"
4124,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"attention, care, or notice, that did not make men brave and"
4125,DIOGENES AND PLATO,independent. As thou callest on me to show thee where and in what
4126,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"manner thou hast misrepresented thy teacher, and as thou seemest to"
4127,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"set an equal value on eloquence and on reasoning, I shall attend to"
4128,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"thee awhile on each of these matters, first inquiring of thee whether"
4129,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"the axiom is Socratic, that it is never becoming to get drunk,"
4130,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_unless_ in the solemnities of Bacchus?
4131,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4132,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ This god was the discoverer of the vine and of its uses.
4133,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4134,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Is drunkenness one of its uses, or the discovery of a god?"
4135,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"If Pallas or Jupiter hath given us reason, we should sacrifice our"
4136,DIOGENES AND PLATO,reason with more propriety to Jupiter or Pallas. To Bacchus is due a
4137,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"libation of wine; the same being his gift, as thou preachest."
4138,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4139,DIOGENES AND PLATO,Another and a graver question.
4140,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4141,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"Did Socrates teach thee that 'slaves are to be scourged, and by no"
4142,DIOGENES AND PLATO,means admonished as though they were the children of the master'?
4143,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4144,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ He did not argue upon government.
4145,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4146,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ He argued upon humanity, whereon all government is"
4147,DIOGENES AND PLATO,founded: whatever is beside it is usurpation.
4148,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4149,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ Are slaves then never to be scourged, whatever be their"
4150,DIOGENES AND PLATO,transgressions and enormities?
4151,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4152,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Whatever they be, they are less than his who reduced them"
4153,DIOGENES AND PLATO,to this condition.
4154,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4155,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ What! though they murder his whole family?
4156,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4157,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Ay, and poison the public fountain of the city."
4158,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4159,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"What am I saying? and to whom? Horrible as is this crime, and next in"
4160,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"atrocity to parricide, thou deemest it a lighter one than stealing a"
4161,DIOGENES AND PLATO,fig or grape. The stealer of these is scourged by thee; the sentence
4162,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"on the poisoner is to cleanse out the receptacle. There is, however, a"
4163,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"kind of poisoning which, to do thee justice, comes before thee with"
4164,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"all its horrors, and which thou wouldst punish capitally, even in such"
4165,DIOGENES AND PLATO,a sacred personage as an aruspex or diviner: I mean the poisoning by
4166,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"incantation. I, and my whole family, my whole race, my whole city, may"
4167,DIOGENES AND PLATO,bite the dust in agony from a truss of henbane in the well; and little
4168,DIOGENES AND PLATO,harm done forsooth! Let an idle fool set an image of me in wax before
4169,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"the fire, and whistle and caper to it, and purr and pray, and chant a"
4170,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"hymn to Hecate while it melts, entreating and imploring her that I may"
4171,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"melt as easily--and thou wouldst, in thy equity and holiness, strangle"
4172,DIOGENES AND PLATO,him at the first stave of his psalmody.
4173,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4174,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ If this is an absurdity, can you find another?"
4175,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4176,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Truly, in reading thy book, I doubted at first, and for a"
4177,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"long continuance, whether thou couldst have been serious; and whether"
4178,DIOGENES AND PLATO,it were not rather a satire on those busy-bodies who are incessantly
4179,DIOGENES AND PLATO,intermeddling in other people's affairs. It was only on the
4180,DIOGENES AND PLATO,protestation of thy intimate friends that I believed thee to have
4181,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"written it in earnest. As for thy question, it is idle to stoop and"
4182,DIOGENES AND PLATO,pick out absurdities from a mass of inconsistency and injustice; but
4183,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"another and another I could throw in, and another and another"
4184,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"afterward, from any page in the volume. Two bare, staring falsehoods"
4185,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"lift their beaks one upon the other, like spring frogs. Thou sayest"
4186,DIOGENES AND PLATO,that no punishment decreed by the laws tendeth to evil. What! not if
4187,DIOGENES AND PLATO,immoderate? not if partial? Why then repeal any penal statute while
4188,DIOGENES AND PLATO,the subject of its animadversion exists? In prisons the less criminal
4189,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"are placed among the more criminal, the inexperienced in vice together"
4190,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"with the hardened in it. This is part of the punishment, though it"
4191,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"precedes the sentence; nay, it is often inflicted on those whom the"
4192,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"judges acquit: the law, by allowing it, does it."
4193,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4194,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"The next is, that he who is punished by the laws is the better for it,"
4195,DIOGENES AND PLATO,however the less depraved. What! if anteriorly to the sentence he
4196,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"lives and converses with worse men, some of whom console him by"
4197,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"deadening the sense of shame, others by removing the apprehension of"
4198,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"punishment? Many laws as certainly make men bad, as bad men make many"
4199,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"laws; yet under thy regimen they take us from the bosom of the nurse,"
4200,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"turn the meat about upon the platter, pull the bed-clothes off, make"
4201,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"us sleep when we would wake, and wake when we would sleep, and never"
4202,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"cease to rummage and twitch us, until they see us safe landed at the"
4203,DIOGENES AND PLATO,grave. We can do nothing (but be poisoned) with impunity. What is
4204,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"worst of all, we must marry certain relatives and connexions, be they"
4205,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"distorted, blear-eyed, toothless, carbuncled, with hair (if any)"
4206,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"eclipsing the reddest torch of Hymen, and with a hide outrivalling in"
4207,DIOGENES AND PLATO,colour and plaits his trimmest saffron robe. At the mention of this
4208,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"indeed, friend Plato, even thou, although resolved to stand out of"
4209,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"harm's way, beginnest to make a wry mouth, and findest it difficult to"
4210,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"pucker and purse it up again, without an astringent store of moral"
4211,DIOGENES AND PLATO,sentences. Hymen is truly no acquaintance of thine. We know the
4212,DIOGENES AND PLATO,delicacies of love which thou wouldst reserve for the gluttony of
4213,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"heroes and the fastidiousness of philosophers. Heroes, like gods, must"
4214,DIOGENES AND PLATO,have their own way; but against thee and thy confraternity of elders I
4215,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"would turn the closet-key, and your mouths might water over, but your"
4216,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"tongues should never enter those little pots of comfiture. Seriously,"
4217,DIOGENES AND PLATO,you who wear embroidered slippers ought to be very cautious of
4218,DIOGENES AND PLATO,treading in the mire. Philosophers should not only live the simplest
4219,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"lives, but should also use the plainest language. Poets, in employing"
4220,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"magnificent and sonorous words, teach philosophy the better by thus"
4221,DIOGENES AND PLATO,disarming suspicion that the finest poetry contains and conveys the
4222,DIOGENES AND PLATO,finest philosophy. You will never let any man hold his right station:
4223,DIOGENES AND PLATO,you would rank Solon with Homer for poetry. This is absurd. The only
4224,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"resemblance is in both being eminently wise. Pindar, too, makes even"
4225,DIOGENES AND PLATO,the cadences of his dithyrambics keep time to the flute of Reason. My
4226,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"tub, which holds fifty-fold thy wisdom, would crack at the"
4227,DIOGENES AND PLATO,reverberation of thy voice.
4228,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4229,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ Farewell.
4230,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4231,DIOGENES AND PLATO,*       *       *       *       *
4232,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4233,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ I mean that every one of thy whimsies hath been picked up
4234,DIOGENES AND PLATO,somewhere by thee in thy travels; and each of them hath been rendered
4235,DIOGENES AND PLATO,more weak and puny by its place of concealment in thy closet. What
4236,DIOGENES AND PLATO,thou hast written on the immortality of the soul goes rather to prove
4237,DIOGENES AND PLATO,the immortality of the body; and applies as well to the body of a
4238,DIOGENES AND PLATO,weasel or an eel as to the fairer one of Agathon or of Aster. Why not
4239,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"at once introduce a new religion, since religions keep and are"
4240,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"relished in proportion as they are salted with absurdity, inside and"
4241,DIOGENES AND PLATO,out? and all of them must have one great crystal of it for the centre;
4242,DIOGENES AND PLATO,but Philosophy pines and dies unless she drinks limpid water. When
4243,DIOGENES AND PLATO,Pherecydes and Pythagoras felt in themselves the majesty of
4244,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"contemplation, they spurned the idea that flesh and bones and arteries"
4245,DIOGENES AND PLATO,should confer it: and that what comprehends the past and the future
4246,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"should sink in a moment and be annihilated for ever. 'No,' cried they,"
4247,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"'the power of thinking is no more in the brain than in the hair,"
4248,DIOGENES AND PLATO,although the brain may be the instrument on which it plays. It is not
4249,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"corporeal, it is not of this world; its existence is eternity, its"
4250,DIOGENES AND PLATO,residence is infinity.' I forbear to discuss the rationality of their
4251,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"belief, and pass on straightway to thine; if, indeed, I am to consider"
4252,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"as one, belief and doctrine."
4253,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4254,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ As you will.
4255,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4256,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ I should rather, then, regard these things as mere"
4257,DIOGENES AND PLATO,ornaments; just as many decorate their apartments with lyres and
4258,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"harps, which they themselves look at from the couch, supinely"
4259,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"complacent, and leave for visitors to admire and play on."
4260,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4261,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ I foresee not how you can disprove my argument on the
4262,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"immortality of the soul, which, being contained in the best of my"
4263,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"dialogues, and being often asked for among my friends, I carry with"
4264,DIOGENES AND PLATO,me.
4265,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4266,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ At this time?
4267,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4268,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ Even so.
4269,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4270,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ Give me then a certain part of it for my perusal.
4271,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4272,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ Willingly.
4273,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4274,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Hermes and Pallas! I wanted but a cubit of it, or at most"
4275,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"a fathom, and thou art pulling it out by the plethron."
4276,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4277,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ This is the place in question.
4278,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4279,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ Read it.
4280,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4281,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ [_Reads._] 'Sayest thou not that death is the opposite of
4282,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"life, and that they spring the one from the other?' '_Yes._' 'What"
4283,DIOGENES AND PLATO,springs then from the living?' '_The dead._' 'And what from the dead?'
4284,DIOGENES AND PLATO,'_The living._' 'Then all things alive spring from the dead.'
4285,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4286,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ Why the repetition? but go on.
4287,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4288,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ [_Reads._] 'Souls therefore exist after death in the infernal
4289,DIOGENES AND PLATO,regions.'
4290,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4291,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ Where is the _therefore_? where is it even as to
4292,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_existence_? As to the _infernal regions_, there is nothing that"
4293,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"points toward a proof, or promises an indication. Death neither"
4294,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"springs from life, nor life from death. Although death is the"
4295,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"inevitable consequence of life, if the observation and experience of"
4296,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"ages go for anything, yet nothing shows us, or ever hath signified,"
4297,DIOGENES AND PLATO,that life comes from death. Thou mightest as well say that a
4298,DIOGENES AND PLATO,barley-corn dies before the germ of another barley-corn grows up from
4299,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"it, than which nothing is more untrue; for it is only the protecting"
4300,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"part of the germ that perishes, when its protection is no longer"
4301,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"necessary. The consequence, that souls exist after death, cannot be"
4302,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"drawn from the corruption of the body, even if it were demonstrable"
4303,DIOGENES AND PLATO,that out of this corruption a live one could rise up. Thou hast not
4304,DIOGENES AND PLATO,said that the soul is among those dead things which living things must
4305,DIOGENES AND PLATO,spring from; thou hast not said that a living soul produces a dead
4306,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"soul, or that a dead soul produces a living one."
4307,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4308,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ No, indeed."
4309,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4310,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ On my faith, thou hast said, however, things no less"
4311,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"inconsiderate, no less inconsequent, no less unwise; and this very"
4312,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"thing must be said and proved, to make thy argument of any value. Do"
4313,DIOGENES AND PLATO,dead men beget children?
4314,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4315,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ I have not said it.
4316,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4317,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ Thy argument implies it.

4320,DIOGENES AND PLATO,reverence.
4321,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4322,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Diogenes._ Whatever we cannot account for is in the same predicament.
4323,DIOGENES AND PLATO,We may be gainers by being ignorant if we can be thought mysterious.
4324,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"It is better to shake our heads and to let nothing out of them, than"
4325,DIOGENES AND PLATO,to be plain and explicit in matters of difficulty. I do not mean in
4326,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"confessing our ignorance or our imperfect knowledge of them, but in"
4327,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"clearing them up perspicuously: for, if we answer with ease, we may"
4328,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"haply be thought good-natured, quick, communicative; never deep,"
4329,DIOGENES AND PLATO,never sagacious; not very defective possibly in our intellectual
4330,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"faculties, yet unequal and chinky, and liable to the probation of"
4331,DIOGENES AND PLATO,every clown's knuckle.
4332,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4333,DIOGENES AND PLATO,_Plato._ The brightest of stars appear the most unsteady and tremulous
4334,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"in their light; not from any quality inherent in themselves, but from"
4335,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"the vapours that float below, and from the imperfection of vision in"
4336,DIOGENES AND PLATO,the surveyor.
4337,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4338,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Diogenes._ Draw thy robe round thee; let the folds fall gracefully,"
4339,DIOGENES AND PLATO,and look majestic. That sentence is an admirable one; but not for me.
4340,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"I want sense, not stars. What then? Do no vapours float below the"
4341,DIOGENES AND PLATO,others? and is there no imperfection in the vision of those who look
4342,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"at _them_, if they are the same men, and look the next moment? We must"
4343,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"move on: I shall follow the dead bodies, and the benighted driver of"
4344,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"their fantastic bier, close and keen as any hyena."
4345,DIOGENES AND PLATO,
4346,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"_Plato._ Certainly, O Diogenes, you excel me in elucidations and"
4347,DIOGENES AND PLATO,similes: mine was less obvious.

4352,DIOGENES AND PLATO,and can attribute to nothing else the complacency with which thou hast
4353,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"listened to me since I released thy cloak. If ever the Athenians, in"
4354,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"their inconstancy, should issue a decree to deprive me of the"
4355,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"appellation they have conferred on me, rise up, I pray thee, in my"

4357,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"Something I do deserve at thy hands; having supplied thee, first with"
4358,DIOGENES AND PLATO,"a store of patience, when thou wert going without any about thee,"
4359,DIOGENES AND PLATO,although it is the readiest viaticum and the heartiest sustenance of

4370,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"of the silly, simpering compliments repeated at introductions, let me"
4371,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,assure you that you are the only man in Florence with whom I would
4372,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,willingly exchange a salutation.
4373,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,
4374,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"_Salomon._ I must think myself highly flattered, Signor Conte, having"
4375,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"always heard that you are not only the greatest democrat, but also the"
4376,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"greatest aristocrat, in Europe."
4377,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,
4378,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"_Alfieri._ These two things, however opposite, which your smile would"
4379,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"indicate, are not so irreconcilable as you imagine. Let us first"
4380,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"understand the words, and then talk about them. The democrat is he who"
4381,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"wishes the people to have a due share in the government, and this"
4382,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,share if you please shall be the principal one. The aristocrat of our
4383,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,days is contented with no actual share in it; but if a man of family
4384,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"is conscious of his dignity, and resentful that another has invaded"
4385,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"it, he may be, and is universally, called an aristocrat. The principal"
4386,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"difference is, that one carries outward what the other carries inward."
4387,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,I am thought an aristocrat by the Florentines for conversing with few
4388,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"people, and for changing my shirt and shaving my beard on other days"
4389,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"than festivals; which the most aristocratical of them never do,"
4390,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"considering it, no doubt, as an excess. I am, however, from my soul a"
4391,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"republican, if prudence and modesty will authorize any man to call"
4392,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"himself so; and this, I trust, I have demonstrated in the most"
4393,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"valuable of my works, the _Treatise on Tyranny_ and the _Dialogue_"
4394,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"with my friends at Siena. The aristocratical part of me, if part of me"
4395,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"it must be called, hangs loose and keeps off insects. I see no"
4396,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"aristocracy in the children of sharpers from behind the counter, nor,"
4397,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"placing the matter in the most favourable point of view, in the"
4398,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,descendants of free citizens who accepted from any vile
4399,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"enslaver--French, Spanish, German, or priest, or monk (represented"
4400,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"with a piece of buffoonery, like a beehive on his head and a picklock"
4401,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,key at his girdle)--the titles of counts and marquises. In Piedmont
4402,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,the matter is different: we must either have been the rabble or the
4403,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"lords; we were military, and we retain over the populace the same rank"
4404,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,and spirit as our ancestors held over the soldiery.
4405,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,
4406,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"_Salomon._ Signor Conte, I have heard of levellers, but I have never"
4407,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"seen one: all are disposed to level down, but nobody to level up. As"
4408,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"for nobility, there is none in Europe beside the Venetian. Nobility"
4409,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,must be self-constituted and independent: the free alone are noble;
4410,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"slavery, like death, levels all. The English come nearest to the"
4411,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"Venetian: they are independent, but want the main characteristic, the"
4412,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"_self-constituted_. You have been in England, Signor Conte, and can"
4413,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,judge of them better than I can.

4417,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,_Alfieri._ It is among those who stand between the peerage and the
4418,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,people that there exists a greater mass of virtue and of wisdom than
4419,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,in the rest of Europe. Much of their dignified simplicity may be
4420,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"attributed to the plainness of their religion, and, what will always"
4421,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"be imitated, to the decorous life of their king: for whatever may be"
4422,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"the defects of either, if we compare them with others round us, they"
4423,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,are excellent.
4424,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,
4425,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"_Salomon._ A young religion jumps upon the shoulders of an older one,"
4426,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"and soon becomes like her, by mockery of her tricks, her cant, and her"
4427,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"decrepitude. Meanwhile the old one shakes with indignation, and swears"
4428,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,there is neither relationship nor likeness. Was there ever a religion
4429,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"in the world that was not the true religion, or was there ever a king"
4430,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,that was not the best of kings?
4431,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,
4432,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,_Alfieri._ In the latter case we must have arrived nigh perfection;
4433,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"since it is evident from the authority of the gravest men--theologians,"
4434,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"presidents, judges, corporations, universities, senates--that every"
4435,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"prince is better than his father, 'of blessed memory, now with God'. If"
4436,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"they continue to rise thus transcendently, earth in a little time will"
4437,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"be incapable of holding them, and higher heavens must be raised upon"
4438,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,the highest heavens for their reception. The lumber of our Italian
4439,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"courts, the most crazy part of which is that which rests upon a red"
4440,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"cushion in a gilt chair, with stars and sheep and crosses dangling from"
4441,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"it, must be approached as Artaxerxes and Domitian. These automatons, we"
4442,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"are told nevertheless, are very condescending. Poor fools who tell us"
4443,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"it! ignorant that where on one side is condescension, on the other side"
4444,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,must be baseness. The rascals have ruined my physiognomy. I wear an
4445,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"habitual sneer upon my face, God confound them for it! even when I"
4446,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,whisper a word of love in the prone ear of my donna.
4447,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,
4448,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,_Salomon._ This temper or constitution of mind I am afraid may do
4449,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,injury to your works.
4450,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,
4451,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,_Alfieri._ Surely not to all: my satire at least must be the better
4452,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,for it.
4453,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,
4454,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,_Salomon._ I think differently. No satire can be excellent where
4455,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,displeasure is expressed with acrimony and vehemence. When satire
4456,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"ceases to smile, it should be momentarily, and for the purpose of"
4457,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,inculcating a moral. Juvenal is hardly more a satirist than Lucan: he
4458,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"is indeed a vigorous and bold declaimer, but he stamps too often, and"
4459,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,splashes up too much filth. We Italians have no delicacy in wit: we
4460,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,have indeed no conception of it; we fancy we must be weak if we are
4461,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,not offensive. The scream of Pulcinello is imitated more easily than
4462,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"the masterly strokes of Plautus, or the sly insinuations of Catullus"
4463,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,and of Flaccus.
4464,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,
4465,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,_Alfieri._ We are the least witty of men because we are the most
4466,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,trifling.
4467,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,
4468,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,_Salomon._ You would persuade me then that to be witty one must be
4469,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,grave: this is surely a contradiction.
4470,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,
4471,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"_Alfieri._ I would persuade you only that banter, pun, and quibble are"
4472,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,the properties of light men and shallow capacities; that genuine
4473,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"humour and true wit require a sound and capacious mind, which is"
4474,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,always a grave one. Contemptuousness is not incompatible with them:
4475,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"worthless is that man who feels no contempt for the worthless, and"
4476,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,weak who treats their emptiness as a thing of weight. At first it may
4477,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"seem a paradox, but it is perfectly true, that the gravest nations"
4478,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,have been the wittiest; and in those nations some of the gravest men.

4490,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"amused in his workshop: such was society. But when he left it, he"
4491,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,meditated intensely upon those limbs and muscles on which he was about

4501,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,vivifying desire of approximation where no danger or loss accompanied
4502,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,it; and Genius was no less confident of his security than of his
4503,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,power. Look from the window. That cottage on the declivity was
4504,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"Dante's: that square and large mansion, with a circular garden before"
4505,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"it elevated artificially, was the first scene of Boccaccio's"
4506,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"_Decameron_. A boy might stand at an equal distance between them, and"
4507,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,break the windows of each with his sling. What idle fabricators of
4508,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,crazy systems will tell me that climate is the creator of genius? The
4509,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"climate of Austria is more regular and more temperate than ours, which"
4510,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"I am inclined to believe is the most variable in the whole universe,"
4511,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"subject, as you have perceived, to heavy fogs for two months in"
4512,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"winter, and to a stifling heat, concentrated within the hills, for"

4514,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"extent of Austria, an extent of several thousand times greater than"
4515,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,our city; and this very street has given birth to fifty.

4542,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,for their genius than all the remainder of the Continent (excepting
4543,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,her sister Athens) in six thousand years. My ignorance of the Greek
4544,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,forbids me to compare our Dante with Homer. The propriety and force of
4545,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,language and the harmony of verse in the glorious Grecian are quite
4546,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"lost to me. Dante had not only to compose a poem, but in great part a"
4547,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"language. Fantastical as the plan of his poem is, and, I will add,"
4548,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"uninteresting and uninviting; unimportant, mean, contemptible, as are"
4549,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"nine-tenths of his characters and his details, and wearisome as is the"
4550,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"scheme of his versification--there are more thoughts highly poetical,"
4551,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"there is more reflection, and the nobler properties of mind and"
4552,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"intellect are brought into more intense action, not only than in the"
4553,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"whole course of French poetry, but also in the whole of continental;"
4554,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,nor do I think (I must here also speak with hesitation) that any one
4555,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"drama of Shakespeare contains so many. Smile as you will, Signor"
4556,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"Conte, what must I think of a city where Michel Angelo, Frate"
4557,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"Bartolomeo, Ghiberti (who formed them), Guicciardini, and Machiavelli"
4558,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"were secondary men? And certainly such were they, if we compare them"
4559,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,with Galileo and Boccaccio and Dante.
4560,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,
4561,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"_Alfieri._ I smiled from pure delight, which I rarely do; for I take"
4562,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"an interest deep and vital in such men, and in those who appreciate"
4563,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,them rightly and praise them unreservedly. These are my
4564,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"fellow-citizens: I acknowledge no other; we are of the same tribe, of"
4565,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"the same household; I bow to them as being older than myself, and I"
4566,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,love them as being better.

4571,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,_Alfieri._ If it were possible that I could ever see his statue in a
4572,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"square at Constantinople, though I should be scourged for an idolater,"
4573,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"I would kiss the pedestal. As this, however, is less likely than that"
4574,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"I should suffer for writing satirically, and as criticism is less"
4575,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"likely to mislead me than speculation, I will revert to our former"

4578,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,Indignation and contempt may be expressed in other poems than such as

4588,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"why by an apparently slight variation, what in one author is"
4589,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"mediocrity, in another is excellence. I have never seen a critic of"

4608,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"preference to other thoughts or pursuits, the noble career you have"
4609,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"entered. Be contented, Signor Conte, with the glory of our first great"
4610,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"dramatist, and neglect altogether any inferior one. Why vex and"
4611,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,torment yourself about the French? They buzz and are troublesome while
4612,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,they are swarming; but the master will soon hive them. Is the whole
4613,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,nation worth the worst of your tragedies? All the present race of
4614,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"them, all the creatures in the world which excite your indignation,"
4615,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"will lie in the grave, while young and old are clapping their hands or"
4616,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,beating their bosoms at your _Bruto Primo_. Consider also that kings
4617,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,and emperors should in your estimation be but as grasshoppers and
4618,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,beetles: let them consume a few blades of your clover without
4619,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"molesting them, without bringing them to crawl on you and claw you."
4620,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,The difference between them and men of genius is almost as great as
4621,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,between men of genius and those higher intelligences who act in

4623,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"flattery and without fear, the angels are not higher above mortals"
4624,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,than you are above the proudest that trample on them.

4629,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,_Salomon._ He who first praises a good book becomingly is next in
4630,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,merit to the author.
4631,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,
4632,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,_Alfieri._ As a writer and as a man I know my station: if I found in
4633,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,"the world five equal to myself, I would walk out of it, not to be"
4634,ALFIERI AND SALOMON THE FLORENTINE JEW,jostled.

4643,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4644,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4645,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ I am ashamed, sir, of my countrymen: let my humiliation"
4646,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,expiate their offence. I wish it had not been a minister of the Gospel
4647,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,who received you with such inhospitality.
4648,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4649,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ Nothing can be more ardent and more cordial than the
4650,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"expressions with which you greet me, M. Rousseau, on my return from"
4651,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,your lakes and mountains.
4652,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4653,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ If the pastor took you for a courtier, I reverence him for"
4654,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,his contemptuousness.
4655,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4656,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ Why so? Indeed you are in the wrong, my friend. No"
4657,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,person has a right to treat another with contemptuousness unless he
4658,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,knows him to deserve it. When a courtier enters the house of a pastor
4659,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"in preference to the next, the pastor should partake in the sentiment"
4660,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"that induced him, or at least not to be offended to be preferred. A"
4661,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,courtier is such at court: in the house of a clergyman he is not a
4662,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"courtier, but a guest. If to be a courtier is offensive, remember that"
4663,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"we punish offences where they are committed, where they can be"
4664,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"examined, where pleadings can be heard for and against the accused,"
4665,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"and where nothing is admitted extraneous from the indictment,"
4666,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,excepting what may be adduced in his behalf by witnesses to the
4667,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,general tenor of his character.
4668,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4669,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ Is it really true that the man told you to mount the
4670,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,hayloft if you wished a night's lodging?
4671,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4672,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ He did: a certain proof that he no more took me to be a
4673,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"courtier than I took him to be. I accepted his offer, and never slept"
4674,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"so soundly. Moderate fatigue, the Alpine air, the blaze of a good fire"
4675,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"(for I was admitted to it some moments), and a profusion of"
4676,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"odoriferous hay, below which a cow was sleeping, subdued my senses,"
4677,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,and protracted my slumbers beyond the usual hour.
4678,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4679,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ You have no right, sir, to be the patron and remunerator"
4680,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,of inhospitality. Three or four such men as you would corrupt all
4681,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"Switzerland, and prepare it for the fangs of France and Austria."
4682,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"Kings, like hyenas, will always fall upon dead carcasses, although"
4683,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"their bellies are full, and although they are conscious that in the"
4684,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,end they will tear one another to pieces over them. Why should you
4685,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,prepare their prey? Were your fire and effulgence given you for this?
4686,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"Why, in short, did you thank this churl? Why did you recommend him to"
4687,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,his superiors for preferment on the next vacancy?
4688,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4689,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ I must adopt your opinion of his behaviour in order to
4690,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,answer you satisfactorily. You suppose him inhospitable: what milder
4691,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"or more effectual mode of reproving him, than to make every dish at"
4692,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"his table admonish him? If he did evil, have I no authority before me"
4693,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"which commands me to render him good for it? Believe me, M. Rousseau,"
4694,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,the execution of this command is always accompanied by the heart's
4695,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"applause, and opportunities of obedience are more frequent here than"
4696,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"anywhere. Would not you exchange resentment for the contrary feeling,"
4697,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,even if religion or duty said nothing about the matter? I am afraid
4698,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"the most philosophical of us are sometimes a little perverse, and will"
4699,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"not be so happy as they might be, because the path is pointed out to"
4700,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"them, and because he who points it out is wise and powerful. Obstinacy"
4701,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"and jealousy, the worst parts of childhood and of manhood, have range"
4702,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,enough for their ill humours without the heavens.
4703,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4704,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ Sir, I perceive you are among my enemies. I did not think"
4705,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"it; for, whatever may be my faults, I am totally free from suspicion."
4706,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4707,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ And do not think it now, I entreat you, my good friend."
4708,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4709,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ Courts and society have corrupted the best heart in
4710,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"France, and have perverted the best intellect."
4711,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4712,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ They have done much evil then.
4713,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4714,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ Answer me, and your own conscience: how could you choose"
4715,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,to live among the perfidies of Paris and Versailles?
4716,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4717,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ Lawyers, and advocates in particular, must live there;"
4718,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,philosophers need not. If every honest man thought it requisite to
4719,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"leave those cities, would the inhabitants be the better?"
4720,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4721,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ You have entered into intimacies with the members of
4722,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"various administrations, opposite in plans and sentiments, but alike"
4723,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"hostile to you, and all of whom, if they could have kept your talents"
4724,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"down, would have done it. Finding the thing impossible, they ceased to"
4725,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"persecute, and would gladly tempt you under the semblance of"
4726,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"friendship and esteem to supplicate for some office, that they might"
4727,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"indicate to the world your unworthiness by refusing you: a proof, as"
4728,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"you know, quite sufficient and self-evident."
4729,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4730,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ They will never tempt me to supplicate for anything but
4731,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"justice, and that in behalf of others. I know nothing of parties. If I"
4732,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"am acquainted with two persons of opposite sides in politics, I"
4733,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,consider them as you consider a watchmaker and a cabinet-maker: one
4734,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"desires to rise by one way, the other by another. Administrations and"
4735,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,systems of government would be quite indifferent to those very
4736,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"functionaries and their opponents, who appear the most zealous"
4737,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"partisans, if their fortunes and consequence were not affixed to them."
4738,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"Several of these men seem consistent, and indeed are; the reason is,"
4739,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,versatility would loosen and detach from them the public esteem and
4740,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,confidence----
4741,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4742,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ By which their girandoles are lighted, their dinners"
4743,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"served, their lackeys liveried, and their opera-girls vie in"
4744,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,benefit-nights. There is no State in Europe where the least wise have
4745,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,not governed the most wise. We find the light and foolish keeping up
4746,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"with the machinery of government easily and leisurely, just as we see"
4747,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,butterflies keep up with carriages at full speed. This is owing in
4748,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,both cases to their levity and their position: the stronger and the
4749,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,more active are left behind. I am resolved to prove that
4750,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,farmers-general are the main causes of the defects in our music.
4751,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4752,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ Prove it, or anything else, provided that the"
4753,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,discussion does not irritate and torment you.
4754,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4755,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ Truth is the object of philosophy.
4756,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4757,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ Not of philosophers: the display of ingenuity, for the"
4758,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"most part, is and always has been it. I must here offer you an opinion"
4759,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"of my own, which, if you think well of me, you will pardon, though you"
4760,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"should disbelieve its solidity. My opinion then is, that truth is not"
4761,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,reasonably the main and ultimate object of philosophy; but that
4762,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,philosophy should seek truth merely as the means of acquiring and of
4763,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"propagating happiness. Truths are simple; wisdom, which is formed by"
4764,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"their apposition and application, is concrete: out of this, in its"
4765,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"vast varieties, open to our wants and wishes, comes happiness. But the"
4766,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,knowledge of all the truths ever yet discovered does not lead
4767,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"immediately to it, nor indeed will ever reach it, unless you make the"
4768,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"more important of them bear upon your heart and intellect, and form,"
4769,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"as it were, the blood that moves and nurtures them."
4770,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4771,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ I never until now entertained a doubt that truth is the
4772,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"ultimate aim and object of philosophy: no writer has denied it, I"
4773,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,think.
4774,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4775,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ Designedly none may: but when it is agreed that
4776,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"happiness is the chief good, it must also be agreed that the chief"
4777,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"wisdom will pursue it; and I have already said, what your own"
4778,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"experience cannot but have pointed out to you, that no truth, or"
4779,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"series of truths, hypothetically, can communicate or attain it. Come,"
4780,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"M. Rousseau, tell me candidly, do you derive no pleasure from a sense"
4781,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,of superiority in genius and independence?
4782,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4783,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ The highest, sir, from a consciousness of independence."
4784,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4785,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ _Ingenuous_ is the epithet we affix to modesty, but"
4786,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"modesty often makes men act otherwise than ingenuously: you, for"
4787,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"example, now. You are angry at the servility of people, and disgusted"
4788,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"at their obtuseness and indifference, on matters of most import to"
4789,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"their welfare. If they were equal to you, this anger would cease; but"
4790,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"the fire would break out somewhere else, on ground which appears at"
4791,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"present sound and level. Voltaire, for instance, is less eloquent than"
4792,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,you: but Voltaire is wittier than any man living. This quality----
4793,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4794,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ Is the quality of a buffoon and a courtier. But the
4795,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"buffoon should have most of it, to support his higher dignity."
4796,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4797,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ Voltaire's is Attic.
4798,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4799,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau_. If malignity is Attic. Petulance is not wit, although a"
4800,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"few grains of wit may be found in petulance: quartz is not gold,"
4801,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,although a few grains of gold may be found in quartz. Voltaire is a
4802,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"monkey in mischief, and a spaniel in obsequiousness. He declaims"
4803,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,against the cruel and tyrannical; and he kisses the hands of
4804,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"adulteresses who murder their husbands, and of robbers who decimate"
4805,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,their gang.
4806,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4807,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ I will not discuss with you the character of the man,"
4808,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,and only that part of the author's on which I spoke. There may be
4809,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"malignity in wit, there cannot be violence. You may irritate and"
4810,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,disquiet with it; but it must be by means of a flower or a feather.
4811,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"Wit and humour stand on one side, irony and sarcasm on the other."
4812,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4813,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ They are in near neighbourhood.
4814,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4815,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ So are the Elysian fields and Tartarus.
4816,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4817,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ Pray, go on: teach me to stand quiet in my stall, while my"
4818,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,masters and managers pass by.
4819,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4820,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ Well then--Pascal argues as closely and methodically;
4821,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,Bossuet is as scientific in the structure of his sentences;
4822,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"Demosthenes, many think, has equal fire, vigour, dexterity: equal"
4823,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"selection of topics and equal temperance in treating them,"
4824,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"immeasurably as he falls short of you in appeals to the sensibility,"
4825,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,and in everything which by way of excellence we usually call genius.
4826,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4827,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ Sir, I see no resemblance between a pleader at the bar, or"
4828,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"a haranguer of the populace, and me."
4829,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4830,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ Certainly his questions are occasional: but one great
4831,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"question hangs in the centre, and high above the rest; and this is,"
4832,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"whether the Mother of liberty and civilization shall exist, or whether"
4833,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,she shall be extinguished in the bosom of her family. As we often
4834,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,apply to Eloquence and her parts the terms we apply to Architecture
4835,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"and hers, let me do it also, and remark that nothing can be more"
4836,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"simple, solid, and symmetrical, nothing more frugal in decoration or"
4837,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"more appropriate in distribution, than the apartments of Demosthenes."
4838,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,Yours excel them in space and altitude; your ornaments are equally
4839,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"chaste and beautiful, with more variety and invention, more airiness"
4840,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"and light. But why, among the Loves and Graces, does Apollo flay"
4841,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,Marsyas?--and why may not the tiara still cover the ears of Midas?
4842,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"Cannot you, who detest kings and courtiers, keep away from them? If I"
4843,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"must be with them, let me be in good humour and good spirits. If I"
4844,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"will tread upon a Persian carpet, let it at least be in clean shoes."
4845,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4846,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"As the raciest wine makes the sharpest vinegar, so the richest fancies"
4847,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"turn the most readily to acrimony. Keep yours, my dear M. Rousseau,"
4848,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,from the exposure and heats that generate it. Be contented; enjoy your
4849,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"fine imagination; and do not throw your salad out of window, nor shove"
4850,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"your cat off your knee, on hearing it said that Shakespeare has a"
4851,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"finer, or that a minister is of opinion that you know more of music"
4852,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,than of state. My friend! the quarrels of ingenious men are generally
4853,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"far less reasonable and just, less placable and moderate, than those"
4854,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,of the stupid and ignorant. We ought to blush at this: and we should
4855,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,blush yet more deeply if we bring them in as parties to our
4856,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,differences. Let us conquer by kindness; which we cannot do easily or
4857,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,well without communication.
4858,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4859,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ The minister would expel me from his antechamber, and"
4860,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"order his valets to buffet me, if I offered him any proposal for the"
4861,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,advantage of mankind.
4862,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4863,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ Call to him, then, from this room, where the valets are"
4864,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"civiler. Nature has given you a speaking-trumpet, which neither storm"
4865,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"can drown nor enemy can silence. If you esteem him, instruct him; if"
4866,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"you despise him, do the same. Surely, you who have much benevolence"
4867,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,would not despise any one willingly or unnecessarily. Contempt is for
4868,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"the incorrigible: now, where upon earth is he whom your genius, if"
4869,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"rightly and temperately exerted, would not influence and correct?"
4870,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4871,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,I never was more flattered or honoured than by your patience in
4872,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,listening to me. Consider me as an old woman who sits by the bedside
4873,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"in your infirmity, who brings you no savoury viand, no exotic fruit,"
4874,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,but a basin of whey or a basket of strawberries from your native
4875,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"hills; assures you that what oppressed you was a dream, occasioned by"
4876,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"the wrong position in which you lay; opens the window, gives you fresh"
4877,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"air, and entreats you to recollect the features of Nature, and to"
4878,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,observe (which no man ever did so accurately) their beauty. In your
4879,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"politics you cut down a forest to make a toothpick, and cannot make"
4880,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,even that out of it! Do not let us in jurisprudence be like critics in
4881,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"the classics, and change whatever can be changed, right or wrong. No"
4882,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,statesman will take your advice. Supposing that any one is liberal in
4883,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"his sentiments and clear-sighted in his views, nevertheless love of"
4884,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"power is jealous, and he would rejoice to see you fleeing from"
4885,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,persecution or turning to meet it. The very men whom you would benefit
4886,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,will treat you worse. As the ministers of kings wish their masters to
4887,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,possess absolute power that the exercise of it may be delegated to
4888,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"them, which it naturally is from the violence and sloth alternate with"
4889,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"despots as with wild beasts, and that they may apprehend no check or"
4890,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"control from those who discover their misdemeanours, in like manner"
4891,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"the people places more trust in favour than in fortune, and hopes to"
4892,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,obtain by subserviency what it never might by election or by chance.
4893,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"Else in free governments, so some are called (for names once given are"
4894,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"the last things lost), all minor offices and employments would be"
4895,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,assigned by ballot. Each province or canton would present a list
4896,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,annually of such persons in it as are worthy to occupy the local
4897,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,administrations.
4898,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4899,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"To avoid any allusion to the country in which we live, let us take"
4900,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"England for example. Is it not absurd, iniquitous, and revolting, that"
4901,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,the minister of a church in Yorkshire should be appointed by a lawyer
4902,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"in London, who never knew him, never saw him, never heard from a"
4903,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,single one of the parishioners a recommendation of any kind? Is it not
4904,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,more reasonable that a justice of the peace should be chosen by those
4905,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,who have always been witnesses of his integrity?
4906,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4907,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ The king should appoint his ministers, and should invest"
4908,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,them with power and splendour; but those ministers should not appoint
4909,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,to any civil or religious place of trust or profit which the community
4910,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,could manifestly fill better. The greater part of offices and
4911,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"dignities should be conferred for a short and stated time, that all"
4912,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,might hope to attain and strive to deserve them. Embassies in
4913,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"particular should never exceed one year in Europe, nor consulates two."
4914,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,To the latter office I assign this duration as the more difficult to
4915,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"fulfil properly, from requiring a knowledge of trade, although a"
4916,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"slight one, and because those who possess any such knowledge are"
4917,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"inclined for the greater part to turn it to their own account, which a"
4918,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,consul ought by no means to do. Frequent election of representatives
4919,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,and of civil officers in the subordinate employments would remove most
4920,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"causes of discontent in the people, and of instability in kingly"
4921,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"power. Here is a lottery in which every one is sure of a prize, if not"
4922,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"for himself, at least for somebody in his family or among his friends;"
4923,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,and the ticket would be fairly paid for out of the taxes.
4924,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4925,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ So it appears to me. What other system can present so
4926,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,obviously to the great mass of the people the two principal piers and
4927,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"buttresses of government, tangible interest and reasonable hope? No"
4928,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"danger of any kind can arise from it, no antipathies, no divisions, no"
4929,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"imposture of demagogues, no caprice of despots. On the contrary, many"
4930,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,and great advantages in places which at the first survey do not appear
4931,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"to border on it. At present, the best of the English juridical"
4932,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"institutions, that of justices of the peace, is viewed with diffidence"
4933,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"and distrust. Elected as they would be, and increased in number, the"
4934,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"whole judicature, civil and criminal, might be confided to them, and"
4935,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,their labours be not only not aggravated but diminished. Suppose them
4936,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,in four divisions to meet at four places in every county once in
4937,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"twenty days, and to possess the power of imposing a fine not exceeding"
4938,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"two hundred francs on every cause implying oppression, and one not"
4939,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,exceeding fifty on such as they should unanimously declare frivolous.
4940,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4941,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ Few would become attorneys, and those from among the"
4942,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,indigent.
4943,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4944,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ Almost the greatest evil that exists in the world,"
4945,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"moral or physical, would be removed. A second appeal might be made in"
4946,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"the following session; a third could only come before Parliament, and"
4947,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"this alone by means of attorneys, the number of whom altogether would"
4948,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,not exceed the number of coroners; for in England there are as many
4949,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,who cut their own throats as who would cut their own purses.
4950,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4951,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ The famous _trial by jury_ would cease: this would disgust
4952,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,the English.
4953,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4954,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ The number of justices would be much augmented: nearly
4955,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"all those who now are jurymen would enjoy this rank and dignity, and"
4956,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,would be flattered by sitting on the same bench with the first
4957,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,gentlemen of the land.
4958,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4959,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ What number would sit?
4960,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4961,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ Three or five in the first instance; five or seven in
4962,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,the second--as the number of causes should permit.
4963,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4964,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ The laws of England are extremely intricate and perplexed:
4965,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,such men would be puzzled.
4966,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4967,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ Such men having no interest in the perplexity, but on"
4968,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"the contrary an interest in unravelling it, would see such laws"
4969,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"corrected. Intricate as they are, questions on those which are the"
4970,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,most so are usually referred by the judges themselves to private
4971,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"arbitration; of which my plan, I conceive, has all the advantages,"
4972,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,united to those of open and free discussion among men of unperverted
4973,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"sense, and unbiased by professional hopes and interests. The different"
4974,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,courts of law in England cost about seventy millions of francs
4975,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"annually. On my system, the justices or judges would receive"
4976,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"five-and-twenty francs daily; as the _special jurymen_ do now, without"
4977,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"any sense of shame or impropriety, however rich they may be: such"
4978,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,being the established practice.
4979,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4980,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ Seventy millions! seventy millions!
4981,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4982,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ There are attorneys and conveyancers in London who gain
4983,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"one hundred thousand francs a year, and advocates more. The"
4984,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,chancellor----
4985,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4986,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ The Celeno of these harpies----
4987,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4988,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ Nets above one million, and is greatly more than an"
4989,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"archbishop in the Church, scattering preferment in Cumberland and"
4990,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,Cornwall from his bench at Westminster.
4991,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4992,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ Absurdities and enormities are great in proportion to
4993,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,custom or insuetude. If we had lived from childhood with a boa
4994,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"constrictor, we should think it no more a monster than a canary-bird."
4995,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"The sum you mentioned, of seventy millions, is incredible."
4996,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
4997,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ In this estimate the expense of letters by the post,"
4998,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"and of journeys made by the parties, is not and cannot be included."
4999,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5000,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ The whole machine of government, civil and religious,"
5001,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,ought never to bear upon the people with a weight so oppressive. I do
5002,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"not add the national defence, which being principally naval is more"
5003,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"costly, nor institutions for the promotion of the arts, which in a"
5004,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,country like England ought to be liberal. But such an expenditure
5005,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"should nearly suffice for these also, in time of peace. Religion and"
5006,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"law indeed should cost nothing: at present the one hangs property, the"
5007,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,other quarters it. I am confounded at the profusion. I doubt whether
5008,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,the Romans expended so much in that year's war which dissolved the
5009,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"Carthaginian empire, and left them masters of the universe. What is"
5010,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"certain, and what is better, it did not cost a tenth of it to colonize"
5011,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"Pennsylvania, in whose forests the cradle of freedom is suspended, and"
5012,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"where the eye of philanthropy, tired with tears and vigils, may wander"
5013,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"and may rest. Your system, or rather your arrangement of one already"
5014,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"established, pleases me. Ministers would only lose thereby that"
5015,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"portion of their possessions which they give away to needy relatives,"
5016,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"unworthy dependants, or the requisite supporters of their authority"
5017,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,and power.
5018,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5019,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ On this plan, no such supporters would be necessary, no"
5020,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"such dependants could exist, and no such relatives could be"
5021,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"disappointed. Beside, the conflicts of their opponents must be"
5022,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"periodical, weak, and irregular."
5023,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5024,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ The craving for the rich carrion would be less keen; the
5025,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"zeal of opposition, as usual, would be measured by the stomach,"
5026,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,whereon hope and overlooking have always a strong influence.
5027,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5028,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ My excellent friend, do not be offended with me for an"
5029,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,ingenuous and frank confession: promise me your pardon.
5030,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5031,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ You need none.
5032,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5033,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ Promise it, nevertheless."
5034,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5035,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ You have said nothing, done nothing, which could in any"
5036,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,way displease me.
5037,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5038,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ You grant me, then, a bill of indemnity for what I may"
5039,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,have undertaken with a good intention since we have been together?
5040,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5041,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ Willingly.
5042,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5043,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ I fell into your views, I walked along with you side by"
5044,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"side, merely to occupy your mind, which I perceived was agitated."
5045,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5046,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"In compliance with your humour, to engage your fancy, to divert it"
5047,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"awhile from Switzerland, by which you appear and partly on my account"
5048,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"to be offended, I began with reflections upon England: I raised up"
5049,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"another cloud in the region of them, light enough to be fantastic and"
5050,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"diaphanous, and to catch some little irradiation from its western"
5051,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,sun. Do not run after it farther; it has vanished already. Consider:
5052,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,the three great nations----
5053,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5054,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ Pray, which are those?"
5055,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5056,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ I cannot in conscience give the palm to the Hottentots,"
5057,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"the Greenlanders, or the Hurons: I meant to designate those who united"
5058,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"to empire the most social virtue and civil freedom. Athens, Rome, and"
5059,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,England have received on the subject of government elaborate treatises
5060,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,from their greatest men. You have reasoned more dispassionately and
5061,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"profoundly on it than Plato has done, or probably than Cicero, led"
5062,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,away as he often is by the authority of those who are inferior to
5063,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,himself: but do you excel Aristoteles in calm and patient
5064,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"investigation? Or, think you, are your reading and range of thought"
5065,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,more extensive than Harrington's and Milton's? Yet what effect have
5066,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,the political works of these marvellous men produced upon the
5067,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"world?--what effect upon any one state, any one city, any one hamlet?"
5068,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"A clerk in office, an accountant, a gauger of small beer, a songwriter"
5069,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"for a tavern dinner, produces more. He thrusts his rags into the hole"
5070,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"whence the wind comes, and sleeps soundly. While you and I are talking"
5071,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"about elevations and proportions, pillars and pilasters, architraves"
5072,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"and friezes, the buildings we should repair are falling to the earth,"
5073,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,and the materials for their restoration are in the quarry.
5074,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5075,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Rousseau._ I could answer you: but my mind has certain moments of
5076,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"repose, or rather of oscillation, which I would not for the world"
5077,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"disturb. Music, eloquence, friendship, bring and prolong them."
5078,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5079,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Malesherbes._ Enjoy them, my dear friend, and convert them if"
5080,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,possible to months and years. It is as much at your arbitration on
5081,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"what theme you shall meditate, as in what meadow you shall botanize;"
5082,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"and you have as much at your option the choice of your thoughts, as of"
5083,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,the keys in your harpsichord.
5084,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5085,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"_Rousseau._ If this were true, who could be unhappy?"
5086,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5087,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,_Malesherbes._ Those of whom it is not true. Those who from want of
5088,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"practice cannot manage their thoughts, who have few to select from,"
5089,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,"and who, because of their sloth or of their weakness, do not roll away"
5090,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,the heaviest from before them.
5091,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5092,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5093,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5094,ROUSSEAU AND MALESHERBES,
5095,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR
5096,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5097,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5098,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ Lucius Lucullus, I come to you privately and unattended for"
5099,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"reasons which you will know; confiding, I dare not say in your"
5100,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"friendship, since no service of mine toward you hath deserved it, but"
5101,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,in your generous and disinterested love of peace. Hear me on. Cneius
5102,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Pompeius, according to the report of my connexions in the city, had,"
5103,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"on the instant of my leaving it for the province, begun to solicit his"
5104,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,dependants to strip me ignominiously of authority. Neither vows nor
5105,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,affinity can bind him. He would degrade the father of his wife; he
5106,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"would humiliate his own children, the unoffending, the unborn; he"
5107,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,would poison his own nascent love--at the suggestion of Ambition.
5108,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Matters are now brought so far, that either he or I must submit to a"
5109,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"reverse of fortune; since no concession can assuage his malice, divert"
5110,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"his envy, or gratify his cupidity. No sooner could I raise myself up,"
5111,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,from the consternation and stupefaction into which the certainty of
5112,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"these reports had thrown me, than I began to consider in what manner"
5113,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,my own private afflictions might become the least noxious to the
5114,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"republic. Into whose arms, then, could I throw myself more naturally"
5115,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"and more securely, to whose bosom could I commit and consign more"
5116,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"sacredly the hopes and destinies of our beloved country, than his who"
5117,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"laid down power in the midst of its enjoyments, in the vigour of"
5118,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"youth, in the pride of triumph, when Dignity solicited, when"
5119,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Friendship urged, entreated, supplicated, and when Liberty herself"
5120,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,invited and beckoned to him from the senatorial order and from the
5121,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"curule chair? Betrayed and abandoned by those we had confided in, our"
5122,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"next friendship, if ever our hearts receive any, or if any will"
5123,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"venture in those places of desolation, flies forward instinctively to"
5124,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,what is most contrary and dissimilar. Caesar is hence the visitant of
5125,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,Lucullus.
5126,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5127,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ I had always thought Pompeius more moderate and more
5128,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"reserved than you represent him, Caius Julius; and yet I am considered"
5129,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"in general, and surely you also will consider me, but little liable to"
5130,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,be prepossessed by him.
5131,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5132,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ Unless he may have ingratiated himself with you recently,"
5133,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,by the administration of that worthy whom last winter his partisans
5134,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"dragged before the Senate, and forced to assert publicly that you and"
5135,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,Cato had instigated a party to circumvent and murder him; and whose
5136,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"carcass, a few days afterward, when it had been announced that he had"
5137,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"died by a natural death, was found covered with bruises, stabs, and"
5138,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,dislocations.
5139,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5140,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ You bring much to my memory which had quite slipped out of
5141,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"it, and I wonder that it could make such an impression on yours. A"
5142,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,proof to me that the interest you take in my behalf began earlier than
5143,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"your delicacy will permit you to acknowledge. You are fatigued, which"
5144,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,I ought to have perceived before.
5145,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5146,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ Not at all; the fresh air has given me life and alertness: I
5147,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,feel it upon my cheek even in the room.
5148,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5149,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ After our dinner and sleep, we will spend the remainder of"
5150,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,the day on the subject of your visit.
5151,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5152,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ Those Ethiopian slaves of yours shiver with cold upon the
5153,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,mountain here; and truly I myself was not insensible to the change of
5154,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"climate, in the way from Mutina."
5155,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5156,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,What white bread! I never found such even at Naples or Capua. This
5157,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Formian wine (which I prefer to the Chian), how exquisite!"
5158,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5159,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ Such is the urbanity of Caesar, even while he bites his"
5160,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,lip with displeasure. How! surely it bleeds! Permit me to examine the
5161,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,cup.
5162,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5163,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ I believe a jewel has fallen out of the rim in the carriage:
5164,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,the gold is rough there.
5165,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5166,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ Marcipor, let me never see that cup again! No answer, I"
5167,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,desire. My guest pardons heavier faults. Mind that dinner be prepared
5168,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,for us shortly.
5169,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5170,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ In the meantime, Lucullus, if your health permits it, shall"
5171,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,we walk a few paces round the villa? for I have not seen anything of
5172,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,the kind before.
5173,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5174,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ The walls are double; the space between them two feet: the
5175,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"materials for the most part earth and straw. Two hundred slaves, and"
5176,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"about as many mules and oxen, brought the beams and rafters up the"
5177,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,mountain; my architects fixed them at once in their places: every part
5178,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"was ready, even the wooden nails. The roof is thatched, you see."
5179,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5180,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ Is there no danger that so light a material should be
5181,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"carried off by the winds, on such an eminence?"
5182,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5183,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ None resists them equally well.
5184,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5185,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ On this immensely high mountain, I should be apprehensive of"
5186,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"the lightning, which the poets, and I think the philosophers too, have"
5187,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,told us strikes the highest.
5188,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5189,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ The poets are right; for whatever is received as truth is
5190,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,truth in poetry; and a fable may illustrate like a fact. But the
5191,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"philosophers are wrong, as they generally are, even in the commonest"
5192,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"things; because they seldom look beyond their own tenets, unless"
5193,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"through captiousness, and because they argue more than they meditate,"
5194,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"and display more than they examine. Archimedes and Euclid are, in my"
5195,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"opinion, after our Epicurus, the worthiest of the name, having kept"
5196,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"apart to the demonstrable, the practical, and the useful. Many of the"
5197,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,rest are good writers and good disputants; but unfaithful suitors of
5198,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"simple science, boasters of their acquaintance with gods and"
5199,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"goddesses, plagiarists and impostors. I had forgotten my roof,"
5200,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,although it is composed of much the same materials as the
5201,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"philosophers'. Let the lightning fall: one handful of silver, or less,"
5202,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,repairs the damage.
5203,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5204,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ Impossible! nor indeed one thousand, nor twenty, if those"
5205,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,tapestries and pictures are consumed.
5206,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5207,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ True; but only the thatch would burn. For, before the"
5208,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"baths were tessellated, I filled the area with alum and water, and"
5209,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"soaked the timbers and laths for many months, and covered them"
5210,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"afterward with alum in powder, by means of liquid glue. Mithridates"
5211,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,taught me this. Having in vain attacked with combustibles a wooden
5212,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"tower, I took it by stratagem, and found within it a mass of alum,"
5213,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"which, if a great hurry had not been observed by us among the enemy in"
5214,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"the attempt to conceal it, would have escaped our notice. I never"
5215,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,scrupled to extort the truth from my prisoners; but my instruments
5216,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"were purple robes and plate, and the only wheel in my armoury destined"
5217,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,to such purposes was the wheel of Fortune.
5218,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5219,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ I wish, in my campaigns, I could have equalled your clemency"
5220,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"and humanity; but the Gauls are more uncertain, fierce, and perfidious"
5221,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,than the wildest tribes of Caucasus; and our policy cannot be carried
5222,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"with us, it must be formed upon the spot. They love you, not for"
5223,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"abstaining from hurting them, but for ceasing; and they embrace you"
5224,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"only at two seasons--when stripes are fresh, or when stripes are"
5225,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"imminent. Elsewhere, I hope to become the rival of Lucullus in this"
5226,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,admirable part of virtue.
5227,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5228,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"I shall never build villas, because--but what are your proportions?"
5229,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,Surely the edifice is extremely low.
5230,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5231,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ There is only one floor; the height of the apartments is
5232,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"twenty feet to the cornice, five above it; the breadth is twenty-five,"
5233,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"the length forty. The building, as you perceive, is quadrangular:"
5234,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,three sides contain four rooms each; the other has many partitions and
5235,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"two stories, for domestics and offices. Here is my salt-bath."
5236,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5237,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ A bath, indeed, for all the Nereids named by Hesiod, with"
5238,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,room enough for the Tritons and their herds and horses.
5239,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5240,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ Here stand my two cows. Their milk is brought to me with
5241,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,its warmth and froth; for it loses its salubrity both by repose and by
5242,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"motion. Pardon me, Caesar: I shall appear to you to have forgotten"
5243,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,that I am not conducting Marcus Varro.
5244,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5245,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ You would convert him into Cacus: he would drive them off.
5246,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,What beautiful beasts! how sleek and white and cleanly! I never saw
5247,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"any like them, excepting when we sacrifice to Jupiter the stately"
5248,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,leader from the pastures of the Clitumnus.
5249,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5250,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ Often do I make a visit to these quiet creatures, and with"
5251,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,no less pleasure than in former days to my horses. Nor indeed can I
5252,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,much wonder that whole nations have been consentaneous in treating
5253,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,them as objects of devotion: the only thing wonderful is that
5254,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,gratitude seems to have acted as powerfully and extensively as fear;
5255,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"indeed, more extensively, for no object of worship whatever has"
5256,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"attracted so many worshippers. Where Jupiter has one, the cow has ten:"
5257,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"she was venerated before he was born, and will be when even the"
5258,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,carvers have forgotten him.
5259,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5260,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ Unwillingly should I see it; for the character of our gods
5261,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,hath formed the character of our nation. Serapis and Isis have stolen
5262,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"in among them within our memory, and others will follow, until at last"
5263,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,Saturn will not be the only one emasculated by his successor. What can
5264,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,be more august than our rites? The first dignitaries of the republic
5265,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,are emulous to administer them: nothing of low or venal has any place
5266,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"in them; nothing pusillanimous, nothing unsocial and austere. I speak"
5267,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,of them as they were; before Superstition woke up again from her
5268,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"slumber, and caught to her bosom with maternal love the alluvial"
5269,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"monsters of the Nile. Philosophy, never fit for the people, had"
5270,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"entered the best houses, and the image of Epicurus had taken the place"
5271,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,of the Lemures. But men cannot bear to be deprived long together of
5272,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"anything they are used to, not even of their fears; and, by a reaction"
5273,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"of the mind appertaining to our nature, new stimulants were looked"
5274,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"for, not on the side of pleasure, where nothing new could be expected"
5275,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"or imagined, but on the opposite. Irreligion is followed by"
5276,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"fanaticism, and fanaticism by irreligion, alternately and perpetually."
5277,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5278,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ The religion of our country, as you observe, is well"
5279,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"adapted to its inhabitants. Our progenitor, Mars, hath Venus recumbent"
5280,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"on his breast and looking up to him, teaching us that pleasure is to"
5281,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,be sought in the bosom of valour and by the means of war. No great
5282,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"alteration, I think, will ever be made in our rites and"
5283,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,ceremonies--the best and most imposing that could be collected from
5284,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"all nations, and uniting them to us by our complacence in adopting"
5285,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"them. The gods themselves may change names, to flatter new power: and,"
5286,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"indeed, as we degenerate, Religion will accommodate herself to our"
5287,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,propensities and desires. Our heaven is now popular: it will become
5288,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"monarchal; not without a crowded court, as befits it, of apparitors"
5289,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"and satellites and minions of both sexes, paid and caressed for"
5290,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"carrying to their stern, dark-bearded master prayers and"
5291,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"supplications. Altars must be strown with broken minds, and incense"
5292,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,rise amid abject aspirations. Gods will be found unfit for their
5293,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"places; and it is not impossible that, in the ruin imminent from our"
5294,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"contentions for power, and in the necessary extinction both of ancient"
5295,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"families and of generous sentiments, our consular fasces may become"
5296,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"the water-sprinklers of some upstart priesthood, and that my son may"
5297,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,apply for lustration to the son of my groom. The interest of such men
5298,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,requires that the spirit of arms and of arts be extinguished. They
5299,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"will predicate peace, that the people may be tractable to them; but a"
5300,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,religion altogether pacific is the fomenter of wars and the nurse of
5301,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"crimes, alluring Sloth from within and Violence from afar. If ever it"
5302,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"should prevail among the Romans, it must prevail alone: for nations"
5303,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"more vigorous and energetic will invade them, close upon them, trample"
5304,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"them under foot; and the name of Roman, which is now the most"
5305,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"glorious, will become the most opprobrious upon earth."
5306,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5307,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ The time, I hope, may be distant; for next to my own name I"
5308,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,hold my country's.
5309,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5310,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ Mine, not coming from Troy or Ida, is lower in my"
5311,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,estimation: I place my country's first.
5312,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5313,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"You are surveying the little lake beside us. It contains no fish,"
5314,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"birds never alight on it, the water is extremely pure and cold; the"
5315,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"walk round is pleasant, not only because there is always a gentle"
5316,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"breeze from it, but because the turf is fine and the surface of the"
5317,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,mountain on this summit is perfectly on a level to a great extent in
5318,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"length--not a trifling advantage to me, who walk often and am weak. I"
5319,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"have no alley, no garden, no enclosure; the park is in the vale below,"
5320,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"where a brook supplies the ponds, and where my servants are lodged;"
5321,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,for here I have only twelve in attendance.
5322,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5323,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ What is that so white, towards the Adriatic?"
5324,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5325,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ The Adriatic itself. Turn round and you may descry the
5326,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,Tuscan Sea. Our situation is reported to be among the highest of the
5327,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,Apennines. Marcipor has made the sign to me that dinner is ready. Pass
5328,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,this way.
5329,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5330,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ What a library is here! Ah, Marcus Tullius! I salute thy"
5331,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,image. Why frownest thou upon me--collecting the consular robe and
5332,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"uplifting the right arm, as when Rome stood firm again, and Catiline"
5333,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,fled before thee?
5334,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5335,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ Just so; such was the action the statuary chose, as adding"
5336,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,a new endearment to the memory of my absent friend.
5337,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5338,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ Sylla, who honoured you above all men, is not here."
5339,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5340,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ I have his _Commentaries_: he inscribed them, as you know,"
5341,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"to me. Something even of our benefactors may be forgotten, and"
5342,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,gratitude be unreproved.
5343,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5344,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ The impression on that couch, and the two fresh honeysuckles"
5345,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"in the leaves of those two books, would show, even to a stranger, that"
5346,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,this room is peculiarly the master's. Are they sacred?
5347,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5348,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ To me and Caesar.
5349,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5350,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ I would have asked permission----
5351,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5352,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ Caius Julius, you have nothing to ask of Polybius and"
5353,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Thucydides; nor of Xenophon, the next to them on the table."
5354,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5355,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ Thucydides! the most generous, the most unprejudiced, the"
5356,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"most sagacious, of historians. Now, Lucullus, you whose judgment in"
5357,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"style is more accurate than any other Roman's, do tell me whether a"
5358,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"commander, desirous of writing his _Commentaries_, could take to"
5359,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,himself a more perfect model than Thucydides?
5360,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5361,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ Nothing is more perfect, nor ever will be: the scholar of"
5362,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Pericles, the master of Demosthenes, the equal of the one in military"
5363,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"science, and of the other not the inferior in civil and forensic; the"
5364,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"calm dispassionate judge of the general by whom he was defeated, his"
5365,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"defender, his encomiast. To talk of such men is conducive not only to"
5366,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,virtue but to health.
5367,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5368,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,*       *       *       *       *
5369,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5370,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,This other is my dining-room. You expect the dishes.
5371,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5372,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ I misunderstood--I fancied----
5373,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5374,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ Repose yourself, and touch with the ebony wand, beside"
5375,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"you, the sphinx on either of those obelisks, right or left."
5376,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5377,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ Let me look at them first.
5378,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5379,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ The contrivance was intended for one person, or two at"
5380,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"most, desirous of privacy and quiet. The blocks of jasper in my pair,"
5381,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"and of porphyry in yours, easily yield in their grooves, each forming"
5382,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"one partition. There are four, containing four platforms. The lower"
5383,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"holds four dishes, such as sucking forest-boars, venison, hares,"
5384,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"tunnies, sturgeons, which you will find within; the upper three, eight"
5385,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"each, but diminutive. The confectionery is brought separately, for the"
5386,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"steam would spoil it, if any should escape. The melons are in the"
5387,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"snow, thirty feet under us: they came early this morning from a place"
5388,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"in the vicinity of Luni, travelling by night."
5389,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5390,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ I wonder not at anything of refined elegance in Lucullus;
5391,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"but really here Antiochia and Alexandria seem to have cooked for us,"
5392,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,and magicians to be our attendants.
5393,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5394,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ The absence of slaves from our repast is the luxury, for"
5395,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Marcipor alone enters, and he only when I press a spring with my foot"
5396,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"or wand. When you desire his appearance, touch that chalcedony just"
5397,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,before you.
5398,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5399,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ I eat quick and rather plentifully; yet the valetudinarian
5400,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"(excuse my rusticity, for I rejoice at seeing it) appears to equal the"
5401,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"traveller in appetite, and to be contented with one dish."
5402,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5403,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ It is milk: such, with strawberries, which ripen on the"
5404,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Apennines many months in continuance, and some other berries of sharp"
5405,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"and grateful flavour, has been my only diet since my first residence"
5406,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,here. The state of my health requires it; and the habitude of nearly
5407,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,three months renders this food not only more commodious to my studies
5408,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"and more conducive to my sleep, but also more agreeable to my palate"
5409,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,than any other.
5410,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5411,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ Returning to Rome or Baiae, you must domesticate and tame"
5412,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,them. The cherries you introduced from Pontus are now growing in
5413,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul; and the largest and best in the
5414,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"world, perhaps, are upon the more sterile side of Lake Larius."
5415,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5416,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ There are some fruits, and some virtues, which require a"
5417,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,harsh soil and bleak exposure for their perfection.
5418,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5419,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ In such a profusion of viands, and so savoury, I perceive no"
5420,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,odour.
5421,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5422,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ A flue conducts heat through the compartments of the
5423,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"obelisks; and, if you look up, you may observe that those gilt roses,"
5424,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"between the astragals in the cornice, are prominent from it half a"
5425,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"span. Here is an aperture in the wall, between which and the outer is"
5426,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,a perpetual current of air. We are now in the dog-days; and I have
5427,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,never felt in the whole summer more heat than at Rome in many days of
5428,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,March.
5429,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5430,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ Usually you are attended by troops of domestics and of
5431,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"dinner-friends, not to mention the learned and scientific, nor your"
5432,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"own family, your attachment to which, from youth upward, is one of the"
5433,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,higher graces in your character. Your brother was seldom absent from
5434,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,you.
5435,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5436,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ Marcus was coming; but the vehement heats along the Arno,"
5437,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"in which valley he has a property he never saw before, inflamed his"
5438,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"blood, and he now is resting for a few days at Faesulae, a little town"
5439,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"destroyed by Sylla within our memory, who left it only air and water,"
5440,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"the best in Tuscany. The health of Marcus, like mine, has been"
5441,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,declining for several months: we are running our last race against
5442,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"each other, and never was I, in youth along the Tiber, so anxious of"
5443,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,first reaching the goal. I would not outlive him: I should reflect too
5444,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"painfully on earlier days, and look forward too despondently on"
5445,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"future. As for friends, lampreys and turbots beget them, and they"
5446,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,spawn not amid the solitude of the Apennines. To dine in company with
5447,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,more than two is a Gaulish and German thing. I can hardly bring myself
5448,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,to believe that I have eaten in concert with twenty; so barbarous and
5449,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,herdlike a practice does not now appeal to me--such an incentive to
5450,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"drink much and talk loosely; not to add, such a necessity to speak"
5451,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"loud, which is clownish and odious in the extreme. On this mountain"
5452,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"summit I hear no noises, no voices, not even of salutation; we have no"
5453,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"flies about us, and scarcely an insect or reptile."
5454,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5455,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ Your amiable son is probably with his uncle: is he well?
5456,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5457,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ Perfectly. He was indeed with my brother in his intended
5458,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"visit to me; but Marcus, unable to accompany him hither, or"
5459,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"superintend his studies in the present state of his health, sent him"
5460,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,directly to his Uncle Cato at Tusculum--a man fitter than either of us
5461,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"to direct his education, and preferable to any, excepting yourself and"
5462,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Marcus Tullius, in eloquence and urbanity."
5463,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5464,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ Cato is so great, that whoever is greater must be the"
5465,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,happiest and first of men.
5466,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5467,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ That any such be still existing, O Julius, ought to excite"
5468,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,no groan from the breast of a Roman citizen. But perhaps I wrong you;
5469,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"perhaps your mind was forced reluctantly back again, on your past"
5470,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,animosities and contests in the Senate.
5471,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5472,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ I revere him, but cannot love him."
5473,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5474,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ Then, Caius Julius, you groaned with reason; and I would"
5475,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,pity rather than reprove you.
5476,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5477,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"On the ceiling at which you are looking, there is no gilding, and"
5478,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"little painting--a mere trellis of vines bearing grapes, and the"
5479,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"heads, shoulders, and arms rising from the cornice only, of boys and"
5480,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"girls climbing up to steal them, and scrambling for them: nothing"
5481,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"overhead; no giants tumbling down, no Jupiter thundering, no Mars and"
5482,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Venus caught at mid-day, no river-gods pouring out their urns upon us;"
5483,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"for, as I think nothing so insipid as a flat ceiling, I think nothing"
5484,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"so absurd as a storied one. Before I was aware, and without my"
5485,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"participation, the painter had adorned that of my bedchamber with a"
5486,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"golden shower, bursting from varied and irradiated clouds. On my"
5487,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"expostulation, his excuse was that he knew the Dana√´ of Scopas, in a"
5488,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"recumbent posture, was to occupy the centre of the room. The walls,"
5489,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"behind the tapestry and pictures, are quite rough. In forty-three days"
5490,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,the whole fabric was put together and habitable.
5491,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5492,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,The wine has probably lost its freshness: will you try some other?
5493,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5494,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ Its temperature is exact; its flavour exquisite. Latterly I
5495,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"have never sat long after dinner, and am curious to pass through the"
5496,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"other apartments, if you will trust me."
5497,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5498,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ I attend you.
5499,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5500,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ Lucullus, who is here? What figure is that on the poop of"
5501,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,the vessel? Can it be----
5502,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5503,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ The subject was dictated by myself; you gave it.
5504,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5505,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ Oh, how beautifully is the water painted! How vividly the"
5506,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,sun strikes against the snows on Taurus! The grey temples and pierhead
5507,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"of Tarsus catch it differently, and the monumental mound on the left"
5508,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,is half in shade. In the countenance of those pirates I did not
5509,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"observe such diversity, nor that any boy pulled his father back: I did"
5510,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,not indeed mark them or notice them at all.
5511,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5512,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ The painter in this fresco, the last work finished, had"
5513,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"dissatisfied me in one particular. 'That beautiful young face,' said"
5514,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"I, 'appears not to threaten death.'"
5515,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5516,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"'Lucius,' he replied, 'if one muscle were moved it were not Caesar's:"
5517,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"beside, he said it jokingly, though resolved.'"
5518,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5519,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"'I am contented with your apology, Antipho; but what are you doing"
5520,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"now? for you never lay down or suspend your pencil, let who will talk"
5521,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,and argue. The lines of that smaller face in the distance are the
5522,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,same.'
5523,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5524,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"'Not the same,' replied he, 'nor very different: it smiles, as surely"
5525,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,the goddess must have done at the first heroic act of her descendant.'
5526,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5527,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ In her exultation and impatience to press forward she seems
5528,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"to forget that she is standing at the extremity of the shell, which"
5529,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,rises up behind out of the water; and she takes no notice of the
5530,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"terror on the countenance of this Cupid who would detain her, nor of"
5531,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,this who is flying off and looking back. The reflection of the shell
5532,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,has given a warmer hue below the knee; a long streak of yellow light
5533,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"in the horizon is on the level of her bosom, some of her hair is"
5534,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,almost lost in it; above her head on every side is the pure azure of
5535,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,the heavens.
5536,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5537,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Oh! and you would not have shown me this? You, among whose primary"
5538,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,studies is the most perfect satisfaction of your guests!
5539,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5540,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ In the next apartment are seven or eight other pictures
5541,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,from our history.
5542,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5543,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,There are no more: what do you look for?
5544,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5545,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ I find not among the rest any descriptive of your own
5546,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"exploits. Ah, Lucullus! there is no surer way of making them"
5547,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,remembered.
5548,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5549,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"This, I presume by the harps in the two corners, is the music-room."
5550,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5551,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ No, indeed; nor can I be said to have one here; for I love"
5552,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"best the music of a single instrument, and listen to it willingly at"
5553,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"all times, but most willingly while I am reading. At such seasons a"
5554,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,voice or even a whisper disturbs me; but music refreshes my brain when
5555,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"I have read long, and strengthen it from the beginning. I find also"
5556,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,that if I write anything in poetry (a youthful propensity still
5557,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"remaining), it gives rapidity and variety and brightness to my ideas."
5558,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"On ceasing, I command a fresh measure and instrument, or another"
5559,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"voice; which is to the mind like a change of posture, or of air to the"
5560,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,body. My heal this benefited by the gentle play thus opened to the
5561,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,most delicate of the fibres.
5562,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5563,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ Let me augur that a disorder so tractable may be soon
5564,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,removed. What is it thought to be?
5565,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5566,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ I am inclined to think, and my physician did not long"
5567,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"attempt to persuade me of the contrary, that the ancient realms of"
5568,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Aeaetes have supplied me with some other plants than the cherry, and"
5569,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,such as I should be sorry to see domesticated here in Italy.
5570,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5571,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ The gods forbid! Anticipate better things! The reason of
5572,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,Lucullus is stronger than the medicaments of Mithridates; but why not
5573,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,use them too? Let nothing be neglected. You may reasonably hope for
5574,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,many years of life: your mother still enjoys it.
5575,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5576,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ To stand upon one's guard against Death exasperates her
5577,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,malice and protracts our sufferings.
5578,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5579,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ Rightly and gravely said: but your country at this time
5580,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,cannot do well without you.
5581,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5582,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ The bowl of milk, which to-day is presented to me, will"
5583,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,shortly be presented to my Manes.
5584,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5585,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ Do you suspect the hand?
5586,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5587,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ I will not suspect a Roman: let us converse no more about
5588,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,it.
5589,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5590,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ It is the only subject on which I am resolved never to
5591,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"think, as relates to myself. Life may concern us, death not; for in"
5592,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"death we neither can act nor reason, we neither can persuade nor"
5593,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"command; and our statues are worth more than we are, let them be but"
5594,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,wax.
5595,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5596,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,*       *       *       *       *
5597,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5598,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ From being for ever in action, for ever in contention, and"
5599,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"from excelling in them all other mortals, what advantage derive we? I"
5600,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"would not ask what satisfaction, what glory? The insects have more"
5601,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"activity than ourselves, the beasts more strength, even inert matter"
5602,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,more firmness and stability; the gods alone more goodness. To the
5603,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,exercise of this every country lies open; and neither I eastward nor
5604,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,you westward have found any exhausted by contests for it.
5605,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5606,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,Must we give men blows because they will not look at us? or chain them
5607,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,to make them hold the balance evener?
5608,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5609,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Do not expect to be acknowledged for what you are, much less for what"
5610,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,you would be; since no one can well measure a great man but upon the
5611,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,bier. There was a time when the most ardent friend to Alexander of
5612,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Macedon would have embraced the partisan for his enthusiasm, who"
5613,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,should have compared him with Alexander of Pherae. It must have been
5614,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"at a splendid feast, and late at it, when Scipio should have been"
5615,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"raised to an equality with Romulus, or Cato with Curius. It has been"
5616,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"whispered in my ear, after a speech of Cicero, 'If he goes on so, he"
5617,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"will tread down the sandal of Marcus Antonius in the long run, and"
5618,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"perhaps leave Hortensius behind.' Officers of mine, speaking about"
5619,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"you, have exclaimed with admiration: 'He fights like Cinna.' Think,"
5620,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,Caius Julius (for you have been instructed to think both as a poet and
5621,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"as a philosopher), that among the hundred hands of Ambition, to whom"
5622,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"we may attribute them more properly than to Briareus, there is not one"
5623,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"which holds anything firmly. In the precipitancy of her course, what"
5624,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"appears great is small, and what appears small is great. Our estimate"
5625,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"of men is apt to be as inaccurate and inexact as that of things, or"
5626,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"more. Wishing to have all on our side, we often leave those we should"
5627,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"keep by us, run after those we should avoid, and call importunately on"
5628,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,others who sit quiet and will not come. We cannot at once catch the
5629,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,applause of the vulgar and expect the approbation of the wise. What
5630,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,are parties? Do men really great ever enter into them? Are they not
5631,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"ball-courts, where ragged adventurers strip and strive, and where"
5632,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"dissolute youths abuse one another, and challenge and game and wager?"
5633,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,If you and I cannot quite divest ourselves of infirmities and
5634,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"passions, let us think, however, that there is enough in us to be"
5635,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"divided into two portions, and let us keep the upper undisturbed and"
5636,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"pure. A part of Olympus itself lies in dreariness and in clouds,"
5637,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,variable and stormy; but it is not the highest: there the gods govern.
5638,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,Your soul is large enough to embrace your country: all other affection
5639,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"is for less objects, and less men are capable of it. Abandon, O"
5640,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,Caesar! such thoughts and wishes as now agitate and propel you: leave
5641,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"them to mere men of the marsh, to fat hearts and miry intellects."
5642,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,Fortunate may we call ourselves to have been born in an age so
5643,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"productive of eloquence, so rich in erudition. Neither of us would be"
5644,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"excluded, or hooted at, on canvassing for these honours. He who can"
5645,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"think dispassionately and deeply as I do, is great as I am; none"
5646,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"other. But his opinions are at freedom to diverge from mine, as mine"
5647,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"are from his; and indeed, on recollection, I never loved those most"
5648,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"who thought with me, but those rather who deemed my sentiments worth"
5649,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"discussion, and who corrected me with frankness and affability."
5650,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5651,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ Lucullus, you perhaps have taken the wiser and better part,"
5652,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,certainly the pleasanter. I cannot argue with you: I would gladly hear
5653,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"one who could, but you again more gladly. I should think unworthily of"
5654,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,you if I thought you capable of yielding or receding. I do not even
5655,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"ask you to keep our conversation long a secret, so greatly does it"
5656,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"preponderate in your favour; so much more of gentleness, of eloquence,"
5657,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"and of argument. I came hither with one soldier, avoiding the cities,"
5658,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,and sleeping at the villa of a confidential friend. To-night I sleep
5659,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"in yours, and, if your dinner does not disturb me, shall sleep"
5660,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,soundly. You go early to rest I know.
5661,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5662,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Lucullus._ Not, however, by daylight. Be assured, Caius Julius, that"
5663,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"greatly as your discourse afflicts me, no part of it shall escape my"
5664,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"lips. If you approach the city with arms, with arms I meet you; then"
5665,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"your denouncer and enemy, at present your host and confidant."
5666,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5667,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Caesar._ I shall conquer you.
5668,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5669,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,_Lucullus._ That smile would cease upon it: you sigh already.
5670,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,
5671,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"_Caesar._ Yes, Lucullus, if I am oppressed I shall overcome my"
5672,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"oppressor: I know my army and myself. A sigh escaped me, and many more"
5673,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"will follow; but one transport will rise amid them, when, vanquisher"
5674,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"of my enemies and avenger of my dignity, I press again the hand of"
5675,LUCULLUS AND CAESAR,"Lucullus, mindful of this day."

5685,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ The broad and billowy summits of yon monstrous trees, one"
5686,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","would imagine, were made for the storms to rest upon when they are"
5687,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","tired of raving. And what bark! It occurs to me, Epicurus, that I have"
5688,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","rarely seen climbing plants attach themselves to these trees, as they"
5689,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","do to the oak, the maple, the beech, and others."
5690,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5691,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ If your remark be true, perhaps the resinous are not"
5692,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",embraced by them so frequently because they dislike the odour of the
5693,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","resin, or some other property of the juices; for they, too, have their"
5694,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",affections and antipathies no less than countries and their climes.
5695,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5696,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ For shame! what would you with me?
5697,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5698,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ I would not interrupt you while you were speaking, nor"
5699,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",while Leontion was replying; this is against my rules and practice.
5700,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Having now ended, kiss me, Ternissa!"
5701,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5702,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ Impudent man! in the name of Pallas, why should I kiss"
5703,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",you?
5704,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5705,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Because you expressed hatred.
5706,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5707,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Do we kiss when we hate?
5708,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5709,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ There is no better end of hating. The sentiment should not
5710,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",exist one moment; and if the hater gives a kiss on being ordered to do
5711,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","it, even to a tree or a stone, that tree or stone becomes the monument"
5712,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",of a fault extinct.
5713,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5714,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ I promise you I never will hate a tree again.
5715,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5716,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ I told you so.
5717,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5718,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ Nevertheless, I suspect, my Ternissa, you will often be"
5719,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","surprised into it. I was very near saying, 'I hate these rude square"
5720,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","stones!' Why did you leave them here, Epicurus?"
5721,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5722,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ It is true, they are the greater part square, and seem to"
5723,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",have been cut out in ancient times for plinths and columns; they are
5724,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","also rude. Removing the smaller, that I might plant violets and"
5725,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","cyclamens and convolvuluses and strawberries, and such other herbs as"
5726,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","grow willingly in dry places, I left a few of these for seats, a few"
5727,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",for tables and for couches.
5728,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5729,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Delectable couches!
5730,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5731,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Laugh as you may, they will become so when they are"
5732,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","covered with moss and ivy, and those other two sweet plants whose"
5733,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","names I do not remember to have found in any ancient treatise, but"
5734,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",which I fancy I have heard Theophrastus call 'Leontion' and
5735,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",'Ternissa'.
5736,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5737,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ The bold, insidious, false creature!"
5738,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5739,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ What is that volume, may I venture to ask, Leontion? Why"
5740,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",do you blush?
5741,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5742,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ I do not blush about it.
5743,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5744,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ You are offended, then, my dear girl."
5745,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5746,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ No, nor offended. I will tell you presently what it"
5747,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",contains. Account to me first for your choice of so strange a place to
5748,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","walk in: a broad ridge, the summit and one side barren, the other a"
5749,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","wood of rose-laurels impossible to penetrate. The worst of all is, we"
5750,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","can see nothing of the city or the Parthenon, unless from the very"
5751,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",top.
5752,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5753,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ The place commands, in my opinion, a most perfect view."
5754,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5755,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ Of what, pray?"
5756,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5757,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Of itself; seeming to indicate that we, Leontion, who"
5758,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","philosophize, should do the same."
5759,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5760,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ Go on, go on! say what you please: I will not hate"
5761,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",anything yet. Why have you torn up by the root all these little
5762,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","mountain ash-trees? This is the season of their beauty: come,"
5763,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Ternissa, let us make ourselves necklaces and armlets, such as may"
5764,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",captivate old Sylvanus and Pan; you shall have your choice. But why
5765,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",have you torn them up?
5766,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5767,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ On the contrary, they were brought hither this morning."
5768,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Sosimenes is spending large sums of money on an olive-ground, and has"
5769,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","uprooted some hundreds of them, of all ages and sizes. I shall cover"
5770,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the rougher part of the hill with them, setting the clematis and vine"
5771,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","and honeysuckle against them, to unite them."
5772,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5773,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ Oh, what a pleasant thing it is to walk in the green light"
5774,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","of the vine trees, and to breathe the sweet odour of their invisible"
5775,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",flowers!
5776,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5777,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ The scent of them is so delicate that it requires a sigh
5778,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","to inhale it; and this, being accompanied and followed by enjoyment,"
5779,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","renders the fragrance so exquisite. Ternissa, it is this, my sweet"
5780,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","friend, that made you remember the green light of the foliage, and"
5781,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",think of the invisible flowers as you would of some blessing from
5782,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",heaven.
5783,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5784,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ I see feathers flying at certain distances just above the
5785,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",middle of the promontory: what can they mean?
5786,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5787,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Cannot you imagine them to be the feathers from the wings
5788,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","of Zethes and Cal√§is, who came hither out of Thrace to behold the"
5789,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",favourite haunts of their mother Oreithyia? From the precipice that
5790,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",hangs over the sea a few paces from the pinasters she is reported to
5791,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",have been carried off by Boreas; and these remains of the primeval
5792,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",forest have always been held sacred on that belief.
5793,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5794,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ The story is an idle one.
5795,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5796,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ Oh no, Leontion! the story is very true."
5797,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5798,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Indeed!
5799,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5800,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ I have heard not only odes, but sacred and most ancient"
5801,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","hymns upon it; and the voice of Boreas is often audible here, and the"
5802,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",screams of Oreithyia.
5803,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5804,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ The feathers, then, really may belong to Cal√§is and"
5805,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Zethes.
5806,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5807,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ I don't believe it; the winds would have carried them
5808,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",away.
5809,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5810,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ The gods, to manifest their power, as they often do by"
5811,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","miracles, could as easily fix a feather eternally on the most"
5812,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","tempestuous promontory, as the mark of their feet upon the flint."
5813,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5814,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ They could indeed; but we know the one to a certainty, and"
5815,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",have no such authority for the other. I have seen these pinasters from
5816,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the extremity of the Piraeus, and have heard mention of the altar"
5817,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",raised to Boreas: where is it?
5818,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5819,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ As it stands in the centre of the platform, we cannot see"
5820,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",it from hence; there is the only piece of level ground in the place.
5821,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5822,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Ternissa intends the altar to prove the truth of the
5823,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",story.
5824,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5825,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Ternissa is slow to admit that even the young can deceive,"
5826,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","much less the old; the gay, much less the serious."
5827,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5828,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ It is as wise to moderate our belief as our desires.
5829,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5830,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Some minds require much belief, some thrive on little."
5831,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Rather an exuberance of it is feminine and beautiful. It acts
5832,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","differently on different hearts; it troubles some, it consoles others;"
5833,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","in the generous it is the nurse of tenderness and kindness, of heroism"
5834,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","and self-devotion; in the ungenerous it fosters pride, impatience of"
5835,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","contradiction and appeal, and, like some waters, what it finds a dry"
5836,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","stick or hollow straw, it leaves a stone."
5837,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5838,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ We want it chiefly to make the way of death an easy one.
5839,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5840,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ There is no easy path leading out of life, and few are the"
5841,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",easy ones that lie within it. I would adorn and smoothen the
5842,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","declivity, and make my residence as commodious as its situation and"
5843,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",dimensions may allow; but principally I would cast under-foot the
5844,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",empty fear of death.
5845,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5846,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ Oh, how can you?"
5847,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5848,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ By many arguments already laid down: then by thinking that
5849,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","some perhaps, in almost every age, have been timid and delicate as"
5850,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Ternissa; and yet have slept soundly, have felt no parent's or"
5851,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","friend's tear upon their faces, no throb against their breasts: in"
5852,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","short, have been in the calmest of all possible conditions, while"
5853,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",those around were in the most deplorable and desperate.
5854,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5855,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ It would pain me to die, if it were only at the idea that"
5856,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",any one I love would grieve too much for me.
5857,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5858,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Let the loss of our friends be our only grief, and the"
5859,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",apprehension of displeasing them our only fear.
5860,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5861,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ No apostrophes! no interjections! Your argument was
5862,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",unsound; your means futile.
5863,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5864,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Tell me, then, whether the horse of a rider on the road"
5865,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",should not be spurred forward if he started at a shadow.
5866,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5867,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Yes.
5868,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5869,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ I thought so: it would, however, be better to guide him"
5870,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","quietly up to it, and to show him that it was one. Death is less than"
5871,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","a shadow: it represents nothing, even imperfectly."
5872,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5873,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ Then at the best what is it? why care about it, think"
5874,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","about it, or remind us that it must befall us? Would you take the same"
5875,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","trouble, when you see my hair entwined with ivy, to make me remember"
5876,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","that, although the leaves are green and pliable, the stem is fragile"
5877,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","and rough, and that before I go to bed I shall have many knots and"
5878,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",entanglements to extricate? Let me have them; but let me not hear of
5879,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",them until the time is come.
5880,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5881,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ I would never think of death as an embarrassment, but as a"
5882,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",blessing.
5883,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5884,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ How? a blessing?
5885,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5886,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ What, if it makes our enemies cease to hate us? what, if"
5887,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",it makes our friends love us the more?
5888,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5889,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Us? According to your doctrine we shall not exist at all.
5890,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5891,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ I spoke of that which is consolatory while we are here,"
5892,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",and of that which in plain reason ought to render us contented to stay
5893,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","no longer. You, Leontion, would make others better; and better they"
5894,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","certainly will be, when their hostilities languish in an empty field,"
5895,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",and their rancour is tired with treading upon dust. The generous
5896,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","affections stir about us at the dreary hour of death, as the blossoms"
5897,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",of the Median apple swell and diffuse their fragrance in the cold.
5898,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5899,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ I cannot bear to think of passing the Styx, lest Charon"
5900,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","should touch me; he is so old and wilful, so cross and ugly."
5901,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5902,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Ternissa! Ternissa! I would accompany you thither, and"
5903,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","stand between. Would you not too, Leontion?"
5904,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5905,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ I don't know.
5906,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5907,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ Oh, that we could go together!"
5908,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5909,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Indeed!
5910,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5911,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ All three, I mean--I said--or was going to say it. How"
5912,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","ill-natured you are, Leontion, to misinterpret me; I could almost cry."
5913,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5914,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ Do not, do not, Ternissa! Should that tear drop from your"
5915,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",eyelash you would look less beautiful.
5916,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5917,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ If it is well to conquer a world, it is better to conquer"
5918,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",two.
5919,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5920,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ That is what Alexander of Macedon wept because he could
5921,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",not accomplish.
5922,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5923,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Ternissa! we three can accomplish it; or any one of us.
5924,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5925,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ How? pray!
5926,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5927,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ We can conquer this world and the next; for you will have
5928,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","another, and nothing should be refused you."
5929,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5930,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ The next by piety: but this, in what manner?"
5931,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5932,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ By indifference to all who are indifferent to us; by
5933,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",taking joyfully the benefit that comes spontaneously; by wishing no
5934,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",more intensely for what is a hair's-breadth beyond our reach than for
5935,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",a draught of water from the Ganges; and by fearing nothing in another
5936,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",life.
5937,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5938,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ This, O Epicurus! is the grand impossibility."
5939,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5940,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Do you believe the gods to be as benevolent and good as
5941,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",you are? or do you not?
5942,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5943,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ Much kinder, much better in every way."
5944,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5945,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Would you kill or hurt the sparrow that you keep in your
5946,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","little dressing-room with a string around the leg, because he hath"
5947,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",flown where you did not wish him to fly?
5948,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5949,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ No! it would be cruel; the string about the leg of so
5950,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",little and weak a creature is enough.
5951,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5952,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ You think so; I think so; God thinks so. This I may say
5953,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",confidently; for whenever there is a sentiment in which strict justice
5954,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","and pure benevolence unite, it must be His."
5955,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5956,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ O Epicurus! when you speak thus--
5957,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5958,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ Well, Ternissa, what then?"
5959,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5960,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ When Epicurus teaches us such sentiments as these, I am"
5961,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",grieved that he has not so great an authority with the Athenians as
5962,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",some others have.
5963,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5964,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ You will grieve more, I suspect, my Ternissa, when he"
5965,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",possesses that authority.
5966,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5967,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ What will he do?
5968,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5969,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Why turn pale? I am not about to answer that he will
5970,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",forget or leave you. No; but the voice comes deepest from the
5971,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","sepulchre, and a great name hath its root in the dead body. If you"
5972,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","invited a company to a feast, you might as well place round the table"
5973,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","live sheep and oxen and vases of fish and cages of quails, as you"
5974,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",would invite a company of friendly hearers to the philosopher who is
5975,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",yet living. One would imagine that the iris of our intellectual eye
5976,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","were lessened by the glory of his presence, and that, like eastern"
5977,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","kings, he could be looked at near only when his limbs are stiff, by"
5978,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","waxlight, in close curtains."
5979,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5980,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ One of whom we know little leaves us a ring or other token
5981,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","of remembrance, and we express a sense of pleasure and of gratitude;"
5982,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","one of whom we know nothing writes a book, the contents of which might"
5983,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",(if we would let them) have done us more good and might have given us
5984,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","more pleasure, and we revile him for it. The book may do what the"
5985,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",legacy cannot; it may be pleasurable and serviceable to others as well
5986,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","as ourselves: we would hinder this too. In fact, all other love is"
5987,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","extinguished by self-love: beneficence, humanity, justice, philosophy,"
5988,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","sink under it. While we insist that we are looking for Truth, we"
5989,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","commit a falsehood. It never was the first object with any one, and"
5990,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",with few the second.
5991,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5992,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Feed unto replenishment your quieter fancies, my sweetest little"
5993,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Ternissa! and let the gods, both youthful and aged, both gentle and"
5994,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","boisterous, administer to them hourly on these sunny downs: what can"
5995,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",they do better?
5996,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
5997,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ But those feathers, Ternissa, what god's may they be?"
5998,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","since you will not pick them up, nor restore them to Cal√§is nor to"
5999,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Zethes.
6000,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6001,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ I do not think they belong to any god whatever; and shall
6002,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",never be persuaded of it unless Epicurus says it is so.
6003,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6004,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ O unbelieving creature! do you reason against the
6005,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",immortals?
6006,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6007,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ It was yourself who doubted, or appeared to doubt, the"
6008,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",flight of Oreithyia. By admitting too much we endanger our religion.
6009,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Beside, I think I discern some upright stakes at equal distances, and"
6010,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",am pretty sure the feathers are tied to them by long strings.
6011,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6012,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ You have guessed the truth.
6013,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6014,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Of what use are they there?
6015,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6016,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ If you have ever seen the foot of a statue broken off just
6017,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","below the ankle, you have then, Leontion and Ternissa, seen the form"
6018,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",of the ground about us. The lower extremities of it are divided into
6019,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","small ridges, as you will perceive if you look around; and these are"
6020,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","covered with corn, olives, and vines. At the upper part, where"
6021,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","cultivation ceases, and where those sheep and goats are grazing,"
6022,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","begins my purchase. The ground rises gradually unto near the summit,"
6023,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","where it grows somewhat steep, and terminates in a precipice. Across"
6024,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the middle I have traced a line, denoted by those feathers, from one"
6025,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",dingle to the other; the two terminations of my intended garden. The
6026,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","distance is nearly a thousand paces, and the path, perfectly on a"
6027,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","level, will be two paces broad, so that I may walk between you; but"
6028,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",another could not join us conveniently. From this there will be
6029,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","several circuitous and spiral, leading by the easiest ascent to the"
6030,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","summit; and several more, to the road along the cultivation"
6031,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","underneath: here will, however, be but one entrance. Among the"
6032,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",projecting fragments and the massive stones yet standing of the
6033,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","boundary-wall, which old pomegranates imperfectly defend, and which my"
6034,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","neighbour has guarded more effectively against invasion, there are"
6035,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","hillocks of crumbling mould, covered in some places with a variety of"
6036,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","moss; in others are elevated tufts, or dim labyrinths of eglantine."
6037,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6038,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Where will you place the statues? for undoubtedly you must
6039,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",have some.
6040,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6041,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ I will have some models for statues. Pygmalion prayed the
6042,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",gods to give life to the image he adored: I will not pray them to give
6043,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",marble to mine. Never may I lay my wet cheek upon the foot under which
6044,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",is inscribed the name of Leontion or Ternissa!
6045,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6046,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Do not make us melancholy; never let us think that the
6047,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","time can come when we shall lose our friends. Glory, literature,"
6048,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",philosophy have this advantage over friendship: remove one object from
6049,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","them, and others fill the void; remove one from friendship, one only,"
6050,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","and not the earth nor the universality of worlds, no, nor the"
6051,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","intellect that soars above and comprehends them, can replace it!"
6052,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6053,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Dear Leontion! always amiable, always graceful! How lovely"
6054,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",do you now appear to me! what beauteous action accompanied your words!
6055,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6056,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ I used none whatever.
6057,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6058,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ That white arm was then, as it is now, over the shoulder"
6059,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","of Ternissa; and her breath imparted a fresh bloom to your cheek, a"
6060,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",new music to your voice. No friendship is so cordial or so delicious
6061,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",as that of girl for girl; no hatred so intense and immovable as that
6062,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",of woman for woman. In youth you love one above the others of your
6063,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","sex; in riper age you hate all, more or less, in proportion to"
6064,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",similarity of accomplishments and pursuits--which sometimes (I wish it
6065,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",were oftener) are bonds of union to man. In us you more easily pardon
6066,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","faults than excellences in each other. _Your_ tempers are such, my"
6067,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","beloved scholars, that even this truth does not ruffle them; and such"
6068,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","is your affection, that I look with confidence to its unabated ardour"
6069,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",at twenty.
6070,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6071,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ Oh, then I am to love Ternissa almost fifteen months!"
6072,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6073,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ And I am destined to survive the loss of it three months
6074,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",above four years!
6075,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6076,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Incomparable creatures! may it be eternal! In loving ye
6077,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",shall follow no example; ye shall step securely over the iron rule
6078,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","laid down for others by the Destinies, and _you_ for ever be Leontion,"
6079,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",and _you_ Ternissa.
6080,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6081,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Then indeed we should not want statues.
6082,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6083,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ But men, who are vainer creatures, would be good for"
6084,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",nothing without them: they must be flattered even by the stones.
6085,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6086,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Very true. Neither the higher arts nor the civic virtues
6087,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",can flourish extensively without the statues of illustrious men. But
6088,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","gardens are not the places for them. Sparrows, wooing on the general's"
6089,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",truncheon (unless he be such a general as one of ours in the last
6090,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","war), and snails besliming the emblems of the poet, do not remind us"
6091,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","worthily of their characters. Porticos are their proper situations,"
6092,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",and those the most frequented. Even there they may lose all honour and
6093,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","distinction, whether from the thoughtlessness of magistrates or from"
6094,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the malignity of rivals. Our own city, the least exposed of any to the"
6095,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","effects of either, presents us a disheartening example. When the"
6096,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Thebans in their jealousy condemned Pindar to the payment of a fine
6097,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","for having praised the Athenians too highly, our citizens erected a"
6098,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",statue of bronze to him.
6099,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6100,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Jealousy of Athens made the Thebans fine him; and jealousy
6101,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",of Thebes made the Athenians thus record it.
6102,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6103,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ And jealousy of Pindar, I suspect, made some poet persuade"
6104,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the archons to render the distinction a vile and worthless one, by"
6105,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",placing his effigy near a king's--one Evagoras of Cyprus.
6106,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6107,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ Evagoras, I think I remember to have read in the"
6108,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","inscription, was rewarded in this manner for his reception of Conon,"
6109,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",defeated by the Lacedemonians.
6110,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6111,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Gratitude was due to him, and some such memorial to record"
6112,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",it. External reverence should be paid unsparingly to the higher
6113,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",magistrates of every country who perform their offices exemplarily;
6114,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",yet they are not on this account to be placed in the same degree with
6115,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","men of primary genius. They never exalt the human race, and rarely"
6116,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","benefit it; and their benefits are local and transitory, while those"
6117,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",of a great writer are universal and eternal.
6118,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6119,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","If the gods did indeed bestow on us a portion of their fire, they seem"
6120,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",to have lighted it in sport and left it; the harder task and the
6121,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",nobler is performed by that genius who raises it clear and glowing
6122,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","from its embers, and makes it applicable to the purposes that dignify"
6123,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","or delight our nature. I have ever said, 'Reverence the rulers.' Let,"
6124,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","then, his image stand; but stand apart from Pindar's. Pallas and Jove!"
6125,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",defend me from being carried down the stream of time among a shoal of
6126,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","royalets, and the rootless weeds they are hatched on!"
6127,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6128,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ So much piety would deserve the exemption, even though"
6129,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",your writings did not hold out the decree.
6130,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6131,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ Child, the compliment is ill turned: if you are ironical,"
6132,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","as you must be on the piety of Epicurus, Atticism requires that you"
6133,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","should continue to be so, at least to the end of the sentence."
6134,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6135,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Irony is my abhorrence. Epicurus may appear less pious
6136,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","than some others, but I am certain he is more; otherwise the gods"
6137,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",would never have given him----
6138,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6139,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ What? what? let us hear!
6140,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6141,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Leontion!
6142,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6143,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Silly girl! Were there any hibiscus or broom growing near
6144,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","at hand, I would send him away and whip you."
6145,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6146,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ There is fern, which is better."
6147,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6148,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ I was not speaking to you: but now you shall have
6149,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",something to answer for yourself. Although you admit no statues in the
6150,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","country, you might at least, methinks, have discovered a retirement"
6151,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",with a fountain in it: here I see not even a spring.
6152,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6153,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Fountain I can hardly say there is; but on the left there
6154,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","is a long crevice or chasm, which we have never yet visited, and which"
6155,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","we cannot discern until we reach it. This is full of soft mould, very"
6156,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","moist, and many high reeds and canes are growing there; and the rock"
6157,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","itself too drips with humidity along it, and is covered with more"
6158,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","tufted moss and more variegated lichens. This crevice, with its"
6159,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","windings and sinuosities, is about four hundred paces long, and in"
6160,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","many parts eleven, twelve, thirteen feet wide, but generally six or"
6161,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","seven. I shall plant it wholly with lilies of the valley, leaving the"
6162,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","irises which occupy the sides as well as the clefts, and also those"
6163,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","other flowers of paler purple, from the autumnal cups of which we"
6164,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",collect the saffron; and forming a narrow path of such turf as I can
6165,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","find there, or rather following it as it creeps among the bays and"
6166,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","hazels and sweet-brier, which had fallen at different times from the"
6167,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","summit and are now grown old, with an infinity of primroses at the"
6168,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","roots. There are nowhere twenty steps without a projection and a turn,"
6169,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",nor in any ten together is the chasm of the same width or figure.
6170,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Hence the ascent in its windings is easy and imperceptible quite to
6171,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the termination, where the rocks are somewhat high and precipitous; at"
6172,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the entrance they lose themselves in privet and elder, and you must"
6173,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",make your way between them through the canes. Do not you remember
6174,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",where I carried you both across the muddy hollow in the footpath?
6175,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6176,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Leontion does.
6177,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6178,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ That place is always wet; not only in this month of
6179,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Puanepsion,[7] which we are beginning to-day, but in midsummer. The"
6180,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","water that causes it comes out a little way above it, but originates"
6181,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","from the crevice, which I will cover at top with rose-laurel and"
6182,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","mountain-ash, with clematis and vine; and I will intercept the little"
6183,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","rill in its wandering, draw it from its concealment, and place it like"
6184,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Bacchus under the protection of the nymphs, who will smile upon it in"
6185,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","its marble cradle, which at present I keep at home."
6186,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6187,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ Leontion, why do you turn away your face? have the nymphs"
6188,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",smiled upon you in it?
6189,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6190,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ I bathed in it once, if you must know, Ternissa! Why now,"
6191,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Ternissa, why do you turn away yours? have the nymphs frowned upon you"
6192,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",for invading their secrets?
6193,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6194,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ Epicurus, you are in the right to bring it away from"
6195,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Athens, from under the eye of Pallas: she might be angry."
6196,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6197,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ You approve of its removal then, my lovely friend?"
6198,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6199,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Mightily. [_Aside._] I wish it may break in pieces on the
6200,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",road.
6201,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6202,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ What did you say?
6203,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6204,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ I wish it were now on the road, that I might try whether"
6205,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",it would hold me--I mean with my clothes on.
6206,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6207,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ It would hold you, and one a span longer. I have another"
6208,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",in the house; but it is not decorated with fauns and satyrs and
6209,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","foliage, like this."
6210,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6211,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ I remember putting my hand upon the frightful satyr's
6212,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","head, to leap in: it seems made for the purpose. But the sculptor"
6213,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",needed not to place the naiad quite so near--he must have been a very
6214,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",impudent man; it is impossible to look for a moment at such a piece of
6215,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",workmanship.
6216,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6217,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ For shame! Leontion!--why, what was it? I do not desire to"
6218,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",know.
6219,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6220,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ I don't remember it.
6221,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6222,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Nor I neither; only the head.
6223,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6224,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ I shall place the satyr toward the rock, that you may"
6225,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","never see him, Ternissa."
6226,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6227,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Very right; he cannot turn round.
6228,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6229,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ The poor naiad had done it, in vain."
6230,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6231,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ All these labourers will soon finish the plantation, if"
6232,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","you superintend them, and are not appointed to some magistrature."
6233,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6234,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Those who govern us are pleased at seeing a philosopher
6235,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","out of the city, and more still at finding in a season of scarcity"
6236,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","forty poor citizens, who might become seditious, made happy and quiet"
6237,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",by such employment.
6238,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6239,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Two evils, of almost equal weight, may befall the man of erudition:"
6240,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","never to be listened to, and to be listened to always. Aware of"
6241,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","these, I devote a large portion of my time and labours to the"
6242,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","cultivation of such minds as flourish best in cities, where my garden"
6243,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","at the gate, although smaller than this, we find sufficiently"
6244,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",capacious. There I secure my listeners; here my thoughts and
6245,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","imaginations have their free natural current, and tarry or wander as"
6246,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",the will invites: may it ever be among those dearest to me!--those
6247,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","whose hearts possess the rarest and divinest faculty, of retaining or"
6248,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",forgetting at option what ought to be forgotten or retained.
6249,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6250,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ The whole ground then will be covered with trees and
6251,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",shrubs?
6252,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6253,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ There are some protuberances in various parts of the
6254,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","eminence, which you do not perceive till you are upon them or above"
6255,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","them. They are almost level at the top, and overgrown with fine grass;"
6256,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",for they catch the better soil brought down in small quantities by the
6257,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",rains. These are to be left unplanted: so is the platform under the
6258,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","pinasters, whence there is a prospect of the city, the harbour, the"
6259,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","isle of Salamis, and the territory of Megara. 'What then!' cried"
6260,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Sosimenes, 'you would hide from your view my young olives, and the"
6261,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",whole length of the new wall I have been building at my own expense
6262,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","between us! and, when you might see at once the whole of Attica, you"
6263,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",will hardly see more of it than I could buy.'
6264,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6265,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ I do not perceive the new wall, for which Sosimenes, no"
6266,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","doubt, thinks himself another Pericles."
6267,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6268,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Those old junipers quite conceal it.
6269,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6270,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ They look warm and sheltering; but I like the rose-laurels
6271,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",much better: and what a thicket of them here is!
6272,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6273,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Leaving all the larger, I shall remove many thousands of"
6274,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","them; enough to border the greater part of the walk, intermixed with"
6275,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",roses.
6276,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6277,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","There is an infinity of other plants and flowers, or weeds as"
6278,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Sosimenes calls them, of which he has cleared his oliveyard, and which"
6279,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","I shall adopt. Twenty of his slaves came in yesterday, laden with"
6280,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","hyacinths and narcissi, anemones and jonquils. 'The curses of our"
6281,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","vineyards,' cried he, 'and good neither for man nor beast. I have"
6282,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",another estate infested with lilies of the valley: I should not wonder
6283,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",if you accepted these too.'
6284,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6285,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","'And with thanks,' answered I."
6286,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6287,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","The whole of his remark I could not collect: he turned aside, and (I"
6288,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",believe) prayed. I only heard 'Pallas'--'Father'--'sound
6289,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",mind'--'inoffensive man'--'good neighbour'. As we walked together I
6290,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","perceived him looking grave, and I could not resist my inclination to"
6291,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","smile as I turned my eyes toward him. He observed it, at first with"
6292,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","unconcern, but by degrees some doubts arose within him, and he said,"
6293,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","'Epicurus, you have been throwing away no less than half a talent on"
6294,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","this sorry piece of mountain, and I fear you are about to waste as"
6295,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",much in labour: for nothing was ever so terrible as the price we are
6296,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","obliged to pay the workman, since the conquest of Persia and the"
6297,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",increase of luxury in our city. Under three obols none will do his
6298,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","day's work. But what, in the name of all the deities, could induce you"
6299,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","to plant those roots, which other people dig up and throw away?'"
6300,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6301,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","'I have been doing,' said I, 'the same thing my whole life through,"
6302,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Sosimenes!'
6303,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6304,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",'How!' cried he; 'I never knew that.'
6305,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6306,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","'Those very doctrines,' added I, 'which others hate and extirpate, I"
6307,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","inculcate and cherish. They bring no riches, and therefore are thought"
6308,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","to bring no advantage; to me, they appear the more advantageous for"
6309,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",that reason. They give us immediately what we solicit through the
6310,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",means of wealth. We toil for the wealth first; and then it remains to
6311,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","be proved whether we can purchase with it what we look for. Now, to"
6312,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","carry our money to the market, and not to find in the market our"
6313,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","money's worth, is great vexation; yet much greater has already"
6314,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","preceded, in running up and down for it among so many competitors, and"
6315,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",through so many thieves.'
6316,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6317,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","After a while he rejoined, 'You really, then, have not overreached"
6318,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",me?'
6319,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6320,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","'In what, my friend?' said I."
6321,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6322,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","'These roots,' he answered, 'may perhaps be good and saleable for some"
6323,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",purpose. Shall you send them into Persia? or whither?'
6324,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6325,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","'Sosimenes, I shall make love-potions of the flowers.'"
6326,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6327,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ O Epicurus! should it ever be known in Athens that they
6328,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","are good for this, you will not have, with all your fences of prunes"
6329,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","and pomegranates, and precipices with brier upon them, a single root"
6330,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",left under ground after the month of Elaphebolion.[8]
6331,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6332,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ It is not every one that knows the preparation.
6333,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6334,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Everybody will try it.
6335,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6336,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ And you, too, Ternissa?"
6337,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6338,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Will you teach me?
6339,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6340,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ This, and anything else I know. We must walk together when"
6341,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",they are in flower.
6342,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6343,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ And can you teach me, then?"
6344,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6345,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ I teach by degrees.
6346,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6347,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ By very slow ones, Epicurus! I have no patience with you;"
6348,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",tell us directly.
6349,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6350,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ It is very material what kind of recipient you bring with
6351,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",you. Enchantresses use a brazen one; silver and gold are employed in
6352,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",other arts.
6353,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6354,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ I will bring any.
6355,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6356,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ My mother has a fine golden one. She will lend it me; she
6357,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",allows me everything.
6358,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6359,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Leontion and Ternissa, those eyes of yours brighten at"
6360,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","inquiry, as if they carried a light within them for a guidance."
6361,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6362,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ No flattery!
6363,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6364,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ No flattery! Come, teach us!"
6365,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6366,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Will you hear me through in silence?
6367,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6368,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ We promise.
6369,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6370,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Sweet girls! the calm pleasures, such as I hope you will"
6371,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","ever find in your walks among these gardens, will improve your beauty,"
6372,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","animate your discourse, and correct the little that may hereafter rise"
6373,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",up for correction in your dispositions. The smiling ideas left in our
6374,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","bosoms from our infancy, that many plants are the favourites of the"
6375,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","gods, and that others were even the objects of their love--having once"
6376,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","been invested with the human form, beautiful and lively and happy as"
6377,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","yourselves--give them an interest beyond the vision; yes, and a"
6378,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",station--let me say it--on the vestibule of our affections. Resign
6379,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","your ingenuous hearts to simple pleasures; and there is none in man,"
6380,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","where men are Attic, that will not follow and outstrip their"
6381,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",movements.
6382,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6383,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ O Epicurus!
6384,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6385,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ What said Ternissa?
6386,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6387,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ Some of those anemones, I do think, must be still in"
6388,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",blossom. Ternissa's golden cup is at home; but she has brought with
6389,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",her a little vase for the filter--and has filled it to the brim. Do
6390,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","not hide your head behind my shoulder, Ternissa; no, nor in my lap."
6391,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6392,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Yes, there let it lie--the lovelier for that tendril of"
6393,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",sunny brown hair upon it. How it falls and rises! Which is the hair?
6394,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",which the shadow?
6395,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6396,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Let the hair rest.
6397,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6398,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ I must not, perhaps, clasp the shadow!"
6399,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6400,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ You philosophers are fond of such unsubstantial things.
6401,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Oh, you have taken my volume! This is deceit."
6402,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6403,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","You live so little in public, and entertain such a contempt for"
6404,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","opinion, as to be both indifferent and ignorant what it is that people"
6405,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",blame you for.
6406,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6407,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ I know what it is I should blame myself for, if I attended"
6408,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",to them. Prove them to be wiser and more disinterested in their wisdom
6409,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","than I am, and I will then go down to them and listen to them. When I"
6410,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","have well considered a thing, I deliver it--regardless of what those"
6411,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",think who neither take the time nor possess the faculty of considering
6412,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","anything well, and who have always lived far remote from the scope of"
6413,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",our speculations.
6414,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6415,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ In the volume you snatched away from me so slyly, I have"
6416,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",defended a position of yours which many philosophers turn into
6417,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","ridicule--namely, that politeness is among the virtues. I wish you"
6418,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",yourself had spoken more at large upon the subject.
6419,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6420,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ It is one upon which a lady is likely to display more
6421,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",ingenuity and discernment. If philosophers have ridiculed my
6422,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","sentiment, the reason is, it is among those virtues which in general"
6423,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",they find most difficult to assume or counterfeit.
6424,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6425,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Surely life runs on the smoother for this equability and
6426,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",polish; and the gratification it affords is more extensive than is
6427,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","afforded even by the highest virtue. Courage, on nearly all occasions,"
6428,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",inflicts as much of evil as it imparts of good. It may be exerted in
6429,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","defence of our country, in defence of those who love us, in defence of"
6430,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",the harmless and the helpless; but those against whom it is thus
6431,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","exerted may possess an equal share of it. If they succeed, then"
6432,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",manifestly the ill it produces is greater than the benefit; if they
6433,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","succumb, it is nearly as great. For many of their adversaries are"
6434,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","first killed and maimed, and many of their own kindred are left to"
6435,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",lament the consequences of the aggression.
6436,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6437,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ You have spoken first of courage, as that virtue which"
6438,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",attracts your sex principally.
6439,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6440,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Not me; I am always afraid of it. I love those best who
6441,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","can tell me the most things I never knew before, and who have patience"
6442,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","with me, and look kindly while they teach me, and almost as if they"
6443,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",were waiting for fresh questions. Now let me hear directly what you
6444,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",were about to say to Leontion.
6445,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6446,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ I was proceeding to remark that temperance comes next; and
6447,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",temperance has then its highest merit when it is the support of
6448,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",civility and politeness. So that I think I am right and equitable in
6449,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","attributing to politeness a distinguished rank, not among the"
6450,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","ornaments of life, but among the virtues. And you, Leontion and"
6451,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Ternissa, will have leaned the more propensely toward this opinion, if"
6452,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","you considered, as I am sure you did, that the peace and concord of"
6453,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","families, friends, and cities are preserved by it; in other terms, the"
6454,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",harmony of the world.
6455,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6456,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ Leontion spoke of courage, you of temperance; the next"
6457,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","great virtue, in the division made by the philosophers, is justice."
6458,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6459,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Temperance includes it; for temperance is imperfect if it
6460,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","is only an abstinence from too much food, too much wine, too much"
6461,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",conviviality or other luxury. It indicates every kind of forbearance.
6462,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Justice is forbearance from what belongs to another. Giving to this
6463,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",one rightly what that one would hold wrongfully in magistrature not in
6464,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the abstract, and is only a part of its office. The perfectly"
6465,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",temperate man is also the perfectly just man; but the perfectly just
6466,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",man (as philosophers now define him) may not be the perfectly
6467,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",temperate one. I include the less in the greater.
6468,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6469,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ We hear of judges, and upright ones too, being immoderate"
6470,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",eaters and drinkers.
6471,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6472,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ The Lacedemonians are temperate in food and courageous in
6473,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","battle; but men like these, if they existed in sufficient numbers,"
6474,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","would devastate the universe. We alone, we Athenians, with less"
6475,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","military skill perhaps, and certainly less rigid abstinence from"
6476,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","voluptuousness and luxury, have set before it the only grand example"
6477,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",of social government and of polished life. From us the seed is
6478,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",scattered; from us flow the streams that irrigate it; and ours are the
6479,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","hands, O Leontion, that collect it, cleanse it, deposit it, and convey"
6480,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",and distribute it sound and weighty through every race and age.
6481,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Exhausted as we are by war, we can do nothing better than lie down and"
6482,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","doze while the weather is fine overhead, and dream (if we can) that we"
6483,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",are affluent and free.
6484,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6485,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",O sweet sea air! how bland art thou and refreshing! Breathe upon
6486,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Leontion! breathe upon Ternissa! bring them health and spirits and
6487,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","serenity, many springs and many summers, and when the vine-leaves have"
6488,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",reddened and rustle under their feet!
6489,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6490,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","These, my beloved girls, are the children of Eternity: they played"
6491,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",around Theseus and the beauteous Amazon; they gave to Pallas the bloom
6492,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","of Venus, and to Venus the animation of Pallas. Is it not better to"
6493,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","enjoy by the hour their soft, salubrious influence, than to catch by"
6494,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",fits the rancid breath of demagogues; than to swell and move under it
6495,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",without or against our will; than to acquire the semblance of
6496,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","eloquence by the bitterness of passion, the tone of philosophy by"
6497,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","disappointment, or the credit of prudence by distrust? Can fortune,"
6498,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","can industry, can desert itself, bestow on us anything we have not"
6499,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",here?
6500,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6501,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ And when shall those three meet? The gods have never
6502,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","united them, knowing that men would put them asunder at the first"
6503,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",appearance.
6504,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6505,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ I am glad to leave the city as often as possible, full as"
6506,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","it is of high and glorious reminiscences, and am inclined much rather"
6507,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","to indulge in quieter scenes, whither the Graces and Friendship lead"
6508,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","me. I would not contend even with men able to contend with me. You,"
6509,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Leontion, I see, think differently, and have composed at last your"
6510,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",long-meditated work against the philosophy of Theophrastus.
6511,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6512,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Why not? he has been praised above his merits.
6513,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6514,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ My Leontion! you have inadvertently given me the reason
6515,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",and origin of all controversial writings. They flow not from a love of
6516,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","truth or a regard for science, but from envy and ill-will. Setting"
6517,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","aside the evil of malignity--always hurtful to ourselves, not always"
6518,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",to others--there is weakness in the argument you have adduced. When a
6519,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","writer is praised above his merits in his own times, he is certain of"
6520,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",being estimated below them in the times succeeding. Paradox is dear to
6521,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","most people: it bears the appearance of originality, but is usually"
6522,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the talent of the superficial, the perverse, and the obstinate."
6523,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6524,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Nothing is more gratifying than the attention you are bestowing on me,"
6525,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",which you always apportion to the seriousness of my observations.
6526,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6527,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ I dislike Theophrastus for his affected contempt of your
6528,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",doctrines.
6529,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6530,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Unreasonably, for the contempt of them; reasonably, if"
6531,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","affected. Good men may differ widely from me, and wiser ones"
6532,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","misunderstand me; for, their wisdom having raised up to them schools"
6533,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","of their own, they have not found leisure to converse with me; and"
6534,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",from others they have received a partial and inexact report. My
6535,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","opinion is, that certain things are indifferent and unworthy of"
6536,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","pursuit or attention, as lying beyond our research and almost our"
6537,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",conjecture; which things the generality of philosophers (for the
6538,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",generality are speculative) deem of the first importance. Questions
6539,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","relating to them I answer evasively, or altogether decline. Again,"
6540,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",there are modes of living which are suitable to some and unsuitable to
6541,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","others. What I myself follow and embrace, what I recommend to the"
6542,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","studious, to the irritable, to the weak in health, would ill agree"
6543,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",with the commonality of citizens. Yet my adversaries cry out: 'Such is
6544,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the opinion and practice of Epicurus!' For instance, I have never"
6545,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","taken a wife, and never will take one; but he from among the mass, who"
6546,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","should avow his imitation of my example, would act as wisely and more"
6547,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",religiously in saying that he chose celibacy because Pallas had done
6548,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",the same.
6549,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6550,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ If Pallas had many such votaries she would soon have few
6551,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",citizens to supply them.
6552,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6553,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ And extremely bad ones, if all followed me in retiring"
6554,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",from the offices of magistracy and of war. Having seen that the most
6555,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","sensible men are the most unhappy, I could not but examine the causes"
6556,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","of it; and, finding that the same sensibility to which they are"
6557,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",indebted for the activity of their intellect is also the restless
6558,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","mover of their jealousy and ambition, I would lead them aside from"
6559,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","whatever operates upon these, and throw under their feet the terrors"
6560,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",their imagination has created. My philosophy is not for the populace
6561,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",nor for the proud: the ferocious will never attain it; the gentle will
6562,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","embrace it, but will not call it mine. I do not desire that they"
6563,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",should: let them rest their heads upon that part of the pillow which
6564,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","they find the softest, and enjoy their own dreams unbroken."
6565,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6566,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ The old are all against you, Epicurus, the name of"
6567,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",pleasure is an affront to them: they know no other kind of it than
6568,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","that which has flowered and seeded, and of which the withered stems"
6569,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",have indeed a rueful look.
6570,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6571,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Unhappily the aged are retentive of long-acquired maxims,"
6572,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","and insensible to new impressions, whether from fancy or from truth:"
6573,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","in fact, their eyes blend the two together. Well might the poet tell"
6574,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",us:
6575,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6576,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Fewer the gifts that gnarled Age presents
6577,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","To elegantly-handed Infancy,"
6578,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Than elegantly-handed Infancy
6579,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Presents to gnarled Age. From both they drop;
6580,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","The middle course of life receives them all,"
6581,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Save the light few that laughing Youth runs off with,"
6582,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Unvalued as a mistress or a flower.
6583,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6584,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ Since, in obedience to your institutions, O Epicurus, I"
6585,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","must not say I am angry, I am offended at least with Theophrastus for"
6586,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","having so misrepresented your opinions, on the necessity of keeping"
6587,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the mind composed and tranquil, and remote from every object and every"
6588,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",sentiment by which a painful sympathy may be excited. In order to
6589,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","display his elegance of language, he runs wherever he can lay a"
6590,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","censure on you, whether he believes in its equity or not."
6591,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6592,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ This is the case with all eloquent men, and all"
6593,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","disputants. Truth neither warms nor elevates them, neither obtains for"
6594,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",them profit nor applause.
6595,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6596,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ I have heard wise remarks very often and very warmly
6597,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",praised.
6598,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6599,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Not for the truth in them, but for the grace, or because"
6600,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",they touched the spring of some preconception or some passion. Man is
6601,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","a hater of truth, a lover of fiction."
6602,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6603,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Theophrastus is a writer of many acquirements and some shrewdness,"
6604,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","usually judicious, often somewhat witty, always elegant; his thoughts"
6605,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","are never confused, his sentences are never incomprehensible. If"
6606,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Aristoteles thought more highly of him than his due, surely you ought"
6607,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",not to censure Theophrastus with severity on the supposition of his
6608,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",rating me below mine; unless you argue that a slight error in a short
6609,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","sum is less pardonable than in a longer. Had Aristoteles been living,"
6610,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","and had he given the same opinion of me, your friendship and perhaps"
6611,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","my self-love might have been wounded; for, if on one occasion he spoke"
6612,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","too favourably, he never spoke unfavourably but with justice. This is"
6613,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",among the indications of orderly and elevated minds; and here stands
6614,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",the barrier that separates them from the common and the waste. Is a
6615,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",man to be angry because an infant is fretful? Is a philosopher to
6616,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","unpack and throw away his philosophy, because an idiot has tried to"
6617,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","overturn it on the road, and has pursued it with gibes and ribaldry?"
6618,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6619,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ Theophrastus would persuade us that, according to your"
6620,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","system, we not only should decline the succour of the wretched, but"
6621,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",avoid the sympathies that poets and historians would awaken in us.
6622,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Probably for the sake of introducing some idle verses, written by a"
6623,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","friend of his, he says that, following the guidance of Epicurus, we"
6624,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",should altogether shun the theatre; and not only when Prometheus and
6625,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Oedipus and Philoctetes are introduced, but even when generous and"
6626,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","kindly sentiments are predominant, if they partake of that tenderness"
6627,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",which belongs to pity. I know not what Thracian lord recovers his
6628,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",daughter from her ravisher; such are among the words they exchange:
6629,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6630,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Father._
6631,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6632,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Insects that dwell in rotten reeds, inert"
6633,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Upon the surface of a stream or pool,"
6634,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Then rush into the air on meshy vans,"
6635,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Are not so different in their varying lives
6636,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","As we are.--Oh! what father on this earth,"
6637,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Holding his child's cool cheek within his palms
6638,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","And kissing his fair front, would wish him man?--"
6639,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Inheritor of wants and jealousies,"
6640,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Of labour, of ambition, of distress,"
6641,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","And, cruellest of all the passions, lust."
6642,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Who that behold me, persecuted, scorned,"
6643,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","A wanderer, e'er could think what friends were mine,"
6644,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","How numerous, how devoted? with what glee"
6645,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Smiled my old house, with what acclaim my courts"
6646,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Rang from without whene'er my war-horse neighed?
6647,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6648,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Daughter._
6649,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6650,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Thy fortieth birthday is not shouted yet
6651,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","By the young peasantry, with rural gifts"
6652,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","And nightly fires along the pointed hills,"
6653,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Yet do thy temples glitter with grey hair
6654,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Scattered not thinly: ah, what sudden change!"
6655,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Only thy voice and heart remain the same:
6656,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","No! that voice trembles, and that heart (I feel),"
6657,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","While it would comfort and console me, breaks."
6658,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6659,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ I would never close my bosom against the feelings of
6660,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",humanity; but I would calmly and well consider by what conduct of life
6661,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",they may enter it with the least importunity and violence. A
6662,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","consciousness that we have promoted the happiness of others, to the"
6663,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","uttermost of our power, is certain not only to meet them at the"
6664,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","threshold, but to bring them along with us, and to render them"
6665,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","accurate and faithful prompters, when we bend perplexedly over the"
6666,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",problem of evil figured by the tragedians. If there were more of pain
6667,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","than of pleasure in the exhibitions of the dramatist, no man in his"
6668,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",senses would attend them twice. All the imitative arts have delight
6669,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",for the principal object: the first of these is poetry; the highest of
6670,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",poetry is tragic.
6671,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6672,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ The epic has been called so.
6673,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6674,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Improperly; for the epic has much more in it of what is
6675,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",prosaic. Its magnitude is no argument. An Egyptian pyramid contains
6676,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","more materials than an Ionic temple, but requires less contrivance,"
6677,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",and exhibits less beauty of design. My simile is yet a defective one;
6678,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","for a tragedy must be carried on with an unbroken interest, and,"
6679,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","undecorated by loose foliage or fantastic branches, it must rise,"
6680,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","like the palm-tree, with a lofty unity. On these matters I am unable"
6681,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","to argue at large, or perhaps correctly; on those, however, which I"
6682,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","have studied and treated, my terms are so explicit and clear, that"
6683,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Theophrastus can never have misunderstood them. Let me recall to your
6684,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",attention but two axioms.
6685,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6686,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Abstinence from low pleasures is the only means of meriting or of
6687,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",obtaining the higher.
6688,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6689,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Kindness in ourselves is the honey that blunts the sting of unkindness
6690,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",in another.
6691,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6692,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ Explain to me, then, O Epicurus, why we suffer so much"
6693,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",from ingratitude.
6694,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6695,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ We fancy we suffer from ingratitude, while in reality we"
6696,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","suffer from self-love. Passion weeps while she says, 'I did not"
6697,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","deserve this from him'; Reason, while she says it, smoothens her brow"
6698,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","at the clear fountain of the heart. Permit me also, like Theophrastus,"
6699,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",to borrow a few words from a poet.
6700,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6701,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ Borrow as many such as any one will entrust to you, and"
6702,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",may Hermes prosper your commerce! Leontion may go to the theatre then;
6703,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",for she loves it.
6704,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6705,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Girls! be the bosom friends of Antigone and Ismene; and
6706,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","you shall enter the wood of the Eumenides without shuddering, and"
6707,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",leave it without the trace of a tear. Never did you appear so graceful
6708,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","to me, O Ternissa--no, not even after this walk do you--as when I saw"
6709,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",you blow a fly from the forehead of Philoctetes in the propyl√´a. The
6710,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","wing, with which Sophocles and the statuary represent him, to drive"
6711,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","away the summer insects in his agony, had wearied his flaccid arm,"
6712,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",hanging down beside him.
6713,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6714,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ Do you imagine, then, I thought him a living man?"
6715,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6716,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ The sentiment was both more delicate and more august from
6717,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","being indistinct. You would have done it, even if he _had_ been a"
6718,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","living man; even if he could have clasped you in his arms, imploring"
6719,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the deities to resemble you in gentleness, you would have done it."
6720,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6721,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ He looked so abandoned by all, and so heroic, yet so"
6722,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",feeble and so helpless! I did not think of turning around to see if
6723,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","any one was near me; or else, perhaps----"
6724,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6725,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ If you could have thought of looking around, you would no"
6726,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",longer have been Ternissa. The gods would have transformed you for it
6727,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",into some tree.
6728,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6729,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ And Epicurus had been walking under it this day, perhaps."
6730,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6731,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ With Leontion, the partner of his sentiments. But the walk"
6732,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",would have been earlier or later than the present hour; since the
6733,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","middle of the day, like the middle of certain fruits, is good for"
6734,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",nothing.
6735,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6736,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ For dinner, surely?"
6737,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6738,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Dinner is a less gratification to me than to many: I dine
6739,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",alone.
6740,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6741,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Why?
6742,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6743,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ To avoid the noise, the heat, and the intermixture both of"
6744,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",odours and of occupations. I cannot bear the indecency of speaking
6745,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",with a mouth in which there is food. I careen my body (since it is
6746,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","always in want of repair) in as unobstructed a space as I can, and I"
6747,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",lie down and sleep awhile when the work is over.
6748,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6749,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ Epicurus! although it would be very interesting, no doubt,"
6750,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",to hear more of what you do after dinner--[_Aside to him._] now don't
6751,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",smile: I shall never forgive you if you say a single word--yet I would
6752,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","rather hear a little about the theatre, and whether you think at last"
6753,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",that women should frequent it; for you have often said the contrary.
6754,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6755,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ I think they should visit it rarely; not because it
6756,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","excites their affections, but because it deadens them. To me nothing"
6757,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","is so odious as to be at once among the rabble and among the heroes,"
6758,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","and, while I am receiving into my heart the most exquisite of human"
6759,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","sensations, to feel upon my shoulder the hand of some inattentive and"
6760,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",insensible young officer.
6761,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6762,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ Oh, very bad indeed! horrible!"
6763,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6764,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ You quite fire at the idea.
6765,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6766,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Not I: I don't care about it.
6767,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6768,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Not about what is very bad indeed? quite horrible?
6769,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6770,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ I seldom go thither.
6771,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6772,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ The theatre is delightful when we erect it in our own
6773,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","house or arbour, and when there is but one spectator."
6774,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6775,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ You must lose the illusion in great part, if you only read"
6776,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the tragedy, which I fancy to be your meaning."
6777,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6778,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ I lose the less of it. Do not imagine that the illusion
6779,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","is, or can be, or ought to be, complete. If it were possible, no"
6780,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Phalaris or Perillus could devise a crueller torture. Here are two
6781,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","imitations: first, the poet's of the sufferer; secondly, the actor's"
6782,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",of both: poetry is superinduced. No man in pain ever uttered the
6783,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","better part of the language used by Sophocles. We admit it, and"
6784,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","willingly, and are at least as much illuded by it as by anything else"
6785,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",we hear or see upon the stage. Poets and statuaries and painters give
6786,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","us an adorned imitation of the object, so skilfully treated that we"
6787,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",receive it for a correct one. This is the only illusion they aim at:
6788,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",this is the perfection of their arts.
6789,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6790,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Do you derive no pleasure from the representation of a
6791,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",consummate actor?
6792,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6793,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ High pleasure; but liable to be overturned in an instant:
6794,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",pleasure at the mercy of any one who sits beside me.
6795,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6796,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",*       *       *       *       *
6797,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6798,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ In my treatise I have only defended your tenets against
6799,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",Theophrastus.
6800,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6801,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ I am certain you have done it with spirit and eloquence,"
6802,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",dear Leontion; and there are but two words in it I would wish you to
6803,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",erase.
6804,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6805,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Which are they?
6806,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6807,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Theophrastus and Epicurus. If you love me, you will do"
6808,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",nothing that may make you uneasy when you grow older; nothing that may
6809,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","allow my adversary to say, 'Leontion soon forgot her Epicurus.' My"
6810,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","maxim is, never to defend my systems or paradoxes; if you undertake"
6811,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","it, the Athenians will insist that I impelled you secretly, or that my"
6812,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",philosophy and my friendship were ineffectual on you.
6813,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6814,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ They shall never say that.
6815,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6816,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ I am not unmoved by the kindness of your intentions. Most
6817,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","people, and philosophers, too, among the rest, when their own conduct"
6818,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","or opinions are questioned, are admirably prompt and dexterous in the"
6819,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","science of defence; but when another's are assailed, they parry with"
6820,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",as ill a grace and faltering a hand as if they never had taken a
6821,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",lesson in it at home. Seldom will they see what they profess to look
6822,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","for; and, finding it, they pick up with it a thorn under the nail."
6823,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","They canter over the solid turf, and complain that there is no corn"
6824,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","upon it; they canter over the corn, and curse the ridges and furrows."
6825,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","All schools of philosophy, and almost all authors, are rather to be"
6826,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",frequented for exercise than for freight; but this exercise ought to
6827,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","acquire us health and strength, spirits and good-humour. There is none"
6828,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","of them that does not supply some truth useful to every man, and some"
6829,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",untruth equally so to the few that are able to wrestle with it. If
6830,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","there were no falsehood in the world, there would be no doubt; if"
6831,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","there were no doubt, there would be no inquiry; if no inquiry, no"
6832,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","wisdom, no knowledge, no genius: and Fancy herself would lie muffled"
6833,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","up in her robe, inactive, pale, and bloated. I wish we could"
6834,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",demonstrate the existence of utility in some other evils as easily as
6835,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",in this.
6836,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6837,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ My remarks on the conduct and on the style of Theophrastus
6838,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",are not confined to him solely. I have taken at last a general view of
6839,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","our literature, and traced as far as I am able its deviation and"
6840,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",decline. In ancient works we sometimes see the mark of the chisel; in
6841,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","modern we might almost suppose that no chisel was employed at all, and"
6842,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",that everything was done by grinding and rubbing. There is an
6843,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","ordinariness, an indistinctness, a generalization, not even to be"
6844,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","found in a flock of sheep. As most reduce what is sand into dust, the"
6845,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","few that avoid it run to a contrary extreme, and would force us to"
6846,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",believe that what is original must be unpolished and uncouth.
6847,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6848,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ There have been in all ages, and in all there will be,"
6849,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",sharp and slender heads made purposely and peculiarly for creeping
6850,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",into the crevices of our nature. While we contemplate the magnificence
6851,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","of the universe, and mensurate the fitness and adaptation of one part"
6852,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","to another, the small philosopher hangs upon a hair or creeps within a"
6853,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","wrinkle, and cries out shrilly from his elevation that we are blind"
6854,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","and superficial. He discovers a wart, he pries into a pore; and he"
6855,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","calls it knowledge of man. Poetry and criticism, and all the fine"
6856,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","arts, have generated such living things, which not only will be"
6857,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",co-existent with them but will (I fear) survive them. Hence history
6858,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",takes alternately the form of reproval and of panegyric; and science
6859,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","in its pulverized state, in its shapeless and colourless atoms,"
6860,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",assumes the name of metaphysics. We find no longer the rich succulence
6861,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","of Herodotus, no longer the strong filament of Thucydides, but"
6862,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","thoughts fit only for the slave, and language for the rustic and the"
6863,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","robber. These writings can never reach posterity, nor serve better"
6864,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",authors near us; for who would receive as documents the perversions of
6865,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","venality and party? Alexander we know was intemperate, and Philip both"
6866,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",intemperate and perfidious: we require not a volume of dissertation on
6867,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the thread of history, to demonstrate that one or other left a"
6868,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","tailor's bill unpaid, and the immorality of doing so; nor a supplement"
6869,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",to ascertain on the best authorities which of the two it was. History
6870,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","should explain to us how nations rose and fell, what nurtured them in"
6871,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","their growth, what sustained them in their maturity; not which orator"
6872,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","ran swiftest through the crowd from the right hand to the left, which"
6873,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","assassin was too strong for manacles, or which felon too opulent for"
6874,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",crucifixion.
6875,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6876,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ It is better, I own it, that such writers should amuse our"
6877,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",idleness than excite our spleen.
6878,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6879,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ What is spleen?
6880,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6881,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Do not ask her; she cannot tell you. The spleen, Ternissa,"
6882,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",is to the heart what Arimanes is to Oromazes.
6883,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6884,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ I am little the wiser yet. Does he ever use such hard
6885,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",words with you?
6886,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6887,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ He means the evil Genius and the good Genius, in the"
6888,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","theogony of the Persians: and would perhaps tell you, as he hath told"
6889,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","me, that the heart in itself is free from evil, but very capable of"
6890,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",receiving and too tenacious of holding it.
6891,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6892,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ In our moral system, the spleen hangs about the heart and"
6893,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","renders it sad and sorrowful, unless we continually keep it in"
6894,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","exercise by kind offices, or in its proper place by serious"
6895,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","investigation and solitary questionings. Otherwise, it is apt to"
6896,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","adhere and to accumulate, until it deadens the principles of sound"
6897,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","action, and obscures the sight."
6898,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6899,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ It must make us very ugly when we grow old.
6900,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6901,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ In youth it makes us uglier, as not appertaining to it: a"
6902,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",little more or less ugliness in decrepitude is hardly worth
6903,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","considering, there being quite enough of it from other quarters: I"
6904,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","would stop it here, however."
6905,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6906,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ Oh, what a thing is age!"
6907,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6908,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Death without death's quiet.
6909,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6910,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Leontion said that even bad writers may amuse our idle
6911,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","hours: alas! even good ones do not much amuse mine, unless they record"
6912,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","an action of love or generosity. As for the graver, why cannot they"
6913,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","come among us and teach us, just as you do?"
6914,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6915,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Would you wish it?
6916,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6917,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ No, no! I do not want them: only I was imagining how"
6918,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","pleasant it is to converse as we are doing, and how sorry I should be"
6919,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","to pore over a book instead of it. Books always make me sigh, and"
6920,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","think about other things. Why do you laugh, Leontion?"
6921,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6922,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ She was mistaken in saying bad authors may amuse our
6923,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",idleness. Leontion knows not then how sweet and sacred idleness is.
6924,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6925,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion._ To render it sweet and sacred, the heart must have a"
6926,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","little garden of its own, with its umbrage and fountains and"
6927,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",perennial flowers--a careless company! Sleep is called sacred as well
6928,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",as sweet by Homer; and idleness is but a step from it. The idleness of
6929,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the wise and virtuous should be both, it being the repose and"
6930,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",refreshment necessary for past exertions and for future; it punishes
6931,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the bad man, it rewards the good; the deities enjoy it, and Epicurus"
6932,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",praises it. I was indeed wrong in my remark; for we should never seek
6933,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","amusement in the foibles of another, never in coarse language, never"
6934,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","in low thoughts. When the mind loses its feeling for elegance, it"
6935,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","grows corrupt and grovelling, and seeks in the crowd what ought to be"
6936,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",found at home.
6937,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6938,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Aspasia believed so, and bequeathed to Leontion, with"
6939,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","every other gift that Nature had bestowed upon her, the power of"
6940,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",delivering her oracles from diviner lips.
6941,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6942,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ Fie! Epicurus! It is well you hide my face for me with
6943,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",your hand. Now take it away; we cannot walk in this manner.
6944,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6945,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ No word could ever fall from you without its weight; no
6946,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",breath from you ought to lose itself in the common air.
6947,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6948,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Leontion._ For shame! What would you have?
6949,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6950,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ He knows not what he would have nor what he would say. I
6951,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",must sit down again. I declare I scarcely understand a single
6952,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","syllable. Well, he is very good, to tease you no longer. Epicurus has"
6953,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",an excellent heart; he would give pain to no one; least of all to you.
6954,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6955,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Leontion,_ I have pained him by this foolish book, and he would only"
6956,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",assure me that he does not for a moment bear me malice. Take the
6957,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","volume; take it, Epicurus! tear it in pieces."
6958,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6959,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ No, Leontion! I shall often look with pleasure on this"
6960,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",trophy of brave humanity; let me kiss the hand that raises it!
6961,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6962,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ I am tired of sitting: I am quite stiff: when shall we
6963,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",walk homeward?
6964,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6965,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Epicurus._ Take my arm, Ternissa!"
6966,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6967,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Oh! I had forgotten that I proposed to myself a trip as
6968,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","far up as the pinasters, to look at the precipice of Oreithyia. Come"
6969,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",along! come along! how alert does the sea air make us! I seem to feel
6970,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",growing at my feet and shoulders the wings of Zethes or Cal√§is.
6971,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6972,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Leontion walks the nimblest to-day.
6973,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6974,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ To display her activity and strength, she runs before us."
6975,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","Sweet Leontion, how good she is! but she should have stayed for us: it"
6976,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",would be in vain to try to overtake her.
6977,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6978,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","No, Epicurus! Mind! take care! you are crushing these little"
6979,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","oleanders--and now the strawberry plants--the whole heap. Not I,"
6980,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","indeed. What would my mother say, if she knew it? And Leontion! she"
6981,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",will certainly look back.
6982,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6983,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ The fairest of the Eudaimones never look back: such are
6984,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","the Hours and Love, Opportunity and Leontion."
6985,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6986,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ How could you dare to treat me in this manner? I did not
6987,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",say again I hated anything.
6988,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6989,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Forgive me!
6990,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6991,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ Violent creature!
6992,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6993,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ If tenderness is violence. Forgive me; and say you love
6994,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",me.
6995,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6996,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Ternissa._ All at once? could you endure such boldness?
6997,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
6998,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Pronounce it! whisper it.
6999,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
7000,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ Go, go. Would it be proper?"
7001,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",
7002,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA",_Epicurus._ Is that sweet voice asking its heart or me? let the

7005,"EPICURUS, LEONTION, AND TERNISSA","_Ternissa._ O Epicurus! you are very, very dear to me; and are the"

7051,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ Tell me the truth.
7052,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7053,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ The report is general.
7054,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7055,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ The truth! the truth! Tell me, Bice."
7056,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7057,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Beatrice._ Marriages, it is said, are made in heaven."
7058,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7059,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ Is heaven then under the paternal roof?
7060,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7061,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ It has been to me hitherto.
7062,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7063,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ And now you seek it elsewhere.
7064,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7065,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Beatrice._ I seek it not. The wiser choose for the weaker. Nay, do"
7066,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"not sigh so. What would you have, my grave pensive Dante? What can I"
7067,DANTE AND BEATRICE,do?
7068,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7069,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ Love me.
7070,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7071,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ I always did.
7072,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7073,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ Love me? O bliss of heaven!
7074,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7075,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Beatrice._ No, no, no! Forbear! Men's kisses are always mischievous"
7076,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"and hurtful; everybody says it. If you truly loved me, you would never"
7077,DANTE AND BEATRICE,think of doing so.
7078,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7079,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ Nor even this!
7080,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7081,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ You forget that you are no longer a boy; and that it is
7082,DANTE AND BEATRICE,not thought proper at your time of life to continue the arm at all
7083,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"about the waist. Beside, I think you would better not put your head"
7084,DANTE AND BEATRICE,against my bosom; it beats too much to be pleasant to you. Why do you
7085,DANTE AND BEATRICE,wish it? why fancy it can do you any good? It grows no cooler; it
7086,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"seems to grow even hotter. Oh, how it burns! Go, go; it hurts me too:"
7087,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"it struggles, it aches, it sobs. Thank you, my gentle friend, for"
7088,DANTE AND BEATRICE,removing your brow away; your hair is very thick and long; and it
7089,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"began to heat me more than you can imagine. While it was there, I"
7090,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"could not see your face so well, nor talk with you so quietly."
7091,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7092,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ Oh, when shall we talk quietly in future?"
7093,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7094,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ When I am married. I shall often come to visit my father.
7095,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"He has always been solitary since my mother's death, which happened in"
7096,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"my infancy, long before you knew me."
7097,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7098,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ How can he endure the solitude of his house when you have
7099,DANTE AND BEATRICE,left it?
7100,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7101,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ The very question I asked him.
7102,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7103,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ You did not then wish to ... to ... go away?
7104,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7105,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ Ah no! It is sad to be an outcast at fifteen.
7106,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7107,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ An outcast?
7108,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7109,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ Forced to leave a home.
7110,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7111,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ For another?
7112,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7113,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ Childhood can never have a second.
7114,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7115,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ But childhood is now over.
7116,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7117,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ I wonder who was so malicious as to tell my father that?
7118,DANTE AND BEATRICE,He wanted me to be married a whole year ago.
7119,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7120,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ And, Bice, you hesitated?"
7121,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7122,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ No; I only wept. He is a dear good father. I never
7123,DANTE AND BEATRICE,disobeyed him but in those wicked tears; and they ran the faster the
7124,DANTE AND BEATRICE,more he reprehended them.
7125,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7126,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ Say, who is the happy youth?"
7127,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7128,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ I know not who ought to be happy if you are not.
7129,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7130,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ I?
7131,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7132,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ Surely you deserve all happiness.
7133,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7134,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ Happiness! any happiness is denied me. Ah, hours of"
7135,DANTE AND BEATRICE,childhood! bright hours! what fragrant blossoms ye unfold! what bitter
7136,DANTE AND BEATRICE,fruits to ripen!
7137,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7138,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ Now cannot you continue to sit under that old fig-tree at
7139,DANTE AND BEATRICE,the corner of the garden? It is always delightful to me to think of
7140,DANTE AND BEATRICE,it.
7141,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7142,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ Again you smile: I wish I could smile too.
7143,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7144,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Beatrice._ You were usually more grave than I, although very often,"
7145,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"two years ago, you told me I was the graver. Perhaps I _was_ then"
7146,DANTE AND BEATRICE,indeed; and perhaps I ought to be now: but really I must smile at the
7147,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"recollection, and make you smile with me."
7148,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7149,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ Recollection of what in particular?
7150,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7151,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ Of your ignorance that a fig-tree is the brittlest of
7152,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"trees, especially when it is in leaf; and moreover of your tumble,"
7153,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"when your head was just above the wall, and your hand (with the verses"
7154,DANTE AND BEATRICE,in it) on the very coping-stone. Nobody suspected that I went every
7155,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"day to the bottom of our garden, to hear you repeat your poetry on the"
7156,DANTE AND BEATRICE,other side; nobody but yourself; you soon found me out. But on that
7157,DANTE AND BEATRICE,occasion I thought you might have been hurt; and I clambered up our
7158,DANTE AND BEATRICE,high peach-tree in the grass plot nearest the place; and thence I saw
7159,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"Messer Dante, with his white sleeve reddened by the fig-juice, and the"
7160,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"seeds sticking to it pertinaciously, and Messer blushing, and trying"
7161,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"to conceal his calamity, and still holding the verses. They were all"
7162,DANTE AND BEATRICE,about me.
7163,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7164,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ Never shall any verse of mine be uttered from my lips, or"
7165,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"from the lips of others, without the memorial of Bice."
7166,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7167,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ Sweet Dante! in the purity of your soul shall Bice live;
7168,DANTE AND BEATRICE,as (we are told by the goatherds and foresters) poor creatures have
7169,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"been found preserved in the serene and lofty regions of the Alps, many"
7170,DANTE AND BEATRICE,years after the breath of life had left them. Already you rival Guido
7171,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"Cavalcante and Cino da Pistoja: you must attempt, nor perhaps shall it"
7172,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"be vainly, to surpass them in celebrity."
7173,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7174,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ If ever I am above them ... and I must be ... I know already
7175,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"what angel's hand will have helped me up the ladder. Beatrice, I vow"
7176,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"to heaven, shall stand higher than Selvaggia, high and glorious and"
7177,DANTE AND BEATRICE,immortal as that name will be. You have given me joy and sorrow; for
7178,DANTE AND BEATRICE,the worst of these (I will not say the least) I will confer on you all
7179,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"the generations of our Italy, all the ages of our world. But first"
7180,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"(alas, from me you must not have it!) may happiness, long happiness,"
7181,DANTE AND BEATRICE,attend you!
7182,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7183,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Beatrice._ Ah, those words rend your bosom! why should they?"
7184,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7185,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ I could go away contented, or almost contented, were I sure"
7186,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"of it. Hope is nearly as strong as despair, and greatly more"
7187,DANTE AND BEATRICE,pertinacious and enduring. You have made me see clearly that you never
7188,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"can be mine in this world: but at the same time, O Beatrice, you have"
7189,DANTE AND BEATRICE,made me see quite as clearly that you may and must be mine in another!
7190,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"I am older than you: precedency is given to age, and not to"
7191,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"worthiness; I will pray for you when I am nearer to God, and purified"
7192,DANTE AND BEATRICE,from the stains of earth and mortality. He will permit me to behold
7193,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"you, lovely as when I left you. Angels in vain should call me onward."
7194,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7195,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Beatrice._ Hush, sweetest Dante! hush!"
7196,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7197,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ It is there where I shall have caught the first glimpse of
7198,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"you again, that I wish all my portion of Paradise to be assigned me;"
7199,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"and there, if far below you, yet within the sight of you, to establish"
7200,DANTE AND BEATRICE,my perdurable abode.
7201,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7202,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ Is this piety? Is this wisdom? O Dante! And may not I be
7203,DANTE AND BEATRICE,called away first?
7204,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7205,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ Alas, alas, how many small feet have swept off the early dew"
7206,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"of life, leaving the path black behind them! But to think that you"
7207,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"should go before me! It almost sends me forward on my way, to receive"
7208,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"and welcome you. If indeed, O Beatrice, such should be God's immutable"
7209,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"will, sometimes look down on me when the song to Him is suspended."
7210,DANTE AND BEATRICE,Oh! look often on me with prayer and pity; for there all prayers are
7211,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"accepted, and all pity is devoid of pain! Why are you silent?"
7212,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7213,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ It is very sinful not to love all creatures in the world.
7214,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"But it is true, O Dante! that we always love those the most who make"
7215,DANTE AND BEATRICE,us the most unhappy?
7216,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7217,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ The remark, I fear, is just."
7218,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7219,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Beatrice._ Then, unless the Virgin be pleased to change my"
7220,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"inclinations, I shall begin at last to love my betrothed; for already"
7221,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"the very idea of him renders me sad, wearisome, and comfortless."
7222,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"Yesterday he sent me a bunch of violets. When I took them up,"
7223,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"delighted as I felt at that sweetest of odours, which you and I once"
7224,DANTE AND BEATRICE,inhaled together....
7225,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7226,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ And only once.
7227,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7228,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Beatrice._ You know why. Be quiet now, and hear me. I dropped the"
7229,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"posy; for around it, hidden by various kinds of foliage, was twined"
7230,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"the bridal necklace of pearls. O Dante, how worthless are the finest"
7231,DANTE AND BEATRICE,of them (and there are many fine ones) in comparison with those little
7232,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"pebbles, some of which (for perhaps I may not have gathered up all)"
7233,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"may be still lying under the peach-tree, and some (do I blush to say"
7234,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"it?) under the fig! Tell me not who threw these, nor for what. But you"
7235,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"know you were always thoughtful, and sometimes reading, sometimes"
7236,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"writing, and sometimes forgetting me, while I waited to see the"
7237,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"crimson cap, and the two bay-leaves I fastened in it, rise above the"
7238,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"garden-wall. How silently you are listening, if you do listen!"
7239,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7240,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ Oh, could my thoughts incessantly and eternally dwell among"
7241,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"these recollections, undisturbed by any other voice ... undistracted"
7242,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"by any other presence! Soon must they abide with me alone, and be"
7243,DANTE AND BEATRICE,repeated by none but me ... repeated in the accents of anguish and
7244,DANTE AND BEATRICE,despair! Why could you not have held in the sad home of your heart
7245,DANTE AND BEATRICE,that necklace and those violets?
7246,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7247,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Beatrice._ My Dante! we must all obey ... I my father, you your God."
7248,DANTE AND BEATRICE,He will never abandon you.
7249,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7250,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ I have ever sung, and will for ever sing, the most glorious"
7251,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"of His works: and yet, O Bice! He abandons me, He casts me off; and He"
7252,DANTE AND BEATRICE,uses your hand for this infliction.
7253,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7254,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Beatrice._ Men travel far and wide, and see many on whom to fix or"
7255,DANTE AND BEATRICE,transfer their affections; but we maidens have neither the power nor
7256,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"the will. Casting our eyes on the ground, we walk along the straight"
7257,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"and narrow road prescribed for us; and, doing this, we avoid in great"
7258,DANTE AND BEATRICE,measure the thorns and entanglements of life. We know we are
7259,DANTE AND BEATRICE,performing our duty; and the fruit of this knowledge is contentment.
7260,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"Season after season, day after day, you have made me serious, pensive,"
7261,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"meditative, and almost wise. Being so little a girl, I was proud that"
7262,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"you, so much taller, should lean on my shoulder to overlook my work."
7263,DANTE AND BEATRICE,And greatly more proud was I when in time you taught me several Latin
7264,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"words, and then whole sentences, both in prose and verse, pasting a"
7265,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"strip of paper over, or obscuring with impenetrable ink, those"
7266,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"passages in the poets which were beyond my comprehension, and might"
7267,DANTE AND BEATRICE,perplex me. But proudest of all was I when you began to reason with
7268,DANTE AND BEATRICE,me. What will now be my pride if you are convinced by the first
7269,DANTE AND BEATRICE,arguments I ever have opposed to you; or if you only take them up and
7270,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"try if they are applicable. Certainly do I know (indeed, indeed I do)"
7271,DANTE AND BEATRICE,that even the patience to consider them will make you happier. Will it
7272,DANTE AND BEATRICE,not then make me so? I entertain no other wish. Is not this true love?
7273,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7274,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ Ah, yes! the truest, the purest, the least perishable, but"
7275,DANTE AND BEATRICE,not the sweetest. Here are the rue and hyssop; but where the rose?
7276,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7277,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ Wicked must be whatever torments you: and will you let
7278,DANTE AND BEATRICE,love do it? Love is the gentlest and kindest breath of God. Are you
7279,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"willing that the tempter should intercept it, and respire it polluted"
7280,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"into your ear? Do not make me hesitate to pray to the Virgin for you,"
7281,DANTE AND BEATRICE,nor tremble lest she look down on you with a reproachful pity. To her
7282,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"alone, O Dante, dare I confide all my thoughts! Lessen not my"
7283,DANTE AND BEATRICE,confidence in my only refuge.
7284,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7285,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ God annihilate a power so criminal! Oh, could my love flow"
7286,DANTE AND BEATRICE,into your breast with hers! It should flow with equal purity.
7287,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7288,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ You have stored my little mind with many thoughts; dear
7289,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"because they are yours, and because they are virtuous. May I not, O my"
7290,DANTE AND BEATRICE,Dante! bring some of them back again to your bosom; as the _contadina_
7291,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"lets down the string from the cottage-beam in winter, and culls a few"
7292,DANTE AND BEATRICE,bunches of the soundest for the master of the vineyard? You have not
7293,DANTE AND BEATRICE,given me glory that the world should shudder at its eclipse. To prove
7294,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"that I am worthy of the smallest part of it, I must obey God; and,"
7295,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"under God, my father. Surely the voice of Heaven comes to us audibly"
7296,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"from a parent's lips. You will be great, and, what is above, all"
7297,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"greatness, good."
7298,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7299,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ Rightly and wisely, my sweet Beatrice, have you spoken in"
7300,DANTE AND BEATRICE,this estimate. Greatness is to goodness what gravel is to porphyry:
7301,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"the one is a movable accumulation, swept along the surface of the"
7302,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"earth; the other stands fixed and solid and alone, above the violence"
7303,DANTE AND BEATRICE,of war and of the tempest; above all that is residuous of a wasted
7304,DANTE AND BEATRICE,world. Little men build up great ones; but the snow colossus soon
7305,DANTE AND BEATRICE,melts: the good stand under the eye of God; and therefore stand.
7306,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7307,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Beatrice._ Now you are calm and reasonable, listen to me, Bice. You"
7308,DANTE AND BEATRICE,must marry.
7309,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7310,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._ Marry?
7311,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7312,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Beatrice._ Unless you do, how can we meet again unreservedly? Worse,"
7313,DANTE AND BEATRICE,worse than ever! I cannot bear to see those large heavy tears
7314,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"following one another, heavy and slow as nuns at the funeral of a"
7315,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"sister. Come, I will kiss off one, if you will promise me faithfully"
7316,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"to shed no more. Be tranquil, be tranquil; only hear reason. There are"
7317,DANTE AND BEATRICE,many who know you; and all who know you must love you. Don't you hear
7318,DANTE AND BEATRICE,me? Why turn aside? and why go farther off? I will have that hand. It
7319,DANTE AND BEATRICE,twists about as if it hated its confinement. Perverse and peevish
7320,DANTE AND BEATRICE,creature! you have no more reason to be sorry than I have; and you
7321,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"have many to the contrary which I have not. Being a man, you are at"
7322,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"liberty to admire a variety, and to make a choice. Is that no comfort"
7323,DANTE AND BEATRICE,to you?
7324,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7325,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Dante._
7326,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7327,DANTE AND BEATRICE,Bid this bosom cease to grieve?
7328,DANTE AND BEATRICE,Bid these eyes fresh objects see?
7329,DANTE AND BEATRICE,Where's the comfort to believe
7330,DANTE AND BEATRICE,None might once have rivall'd me?
7331,DANTE AND BEATRICE,What! my freedom to receive?
7332,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"Broken hearts, are they the free?"
7333,DANTE AND BEATRICE,For another can I live
7334,DANTE AND BEATRICE,When I may not live for thee?
7335,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7336,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ I will never be fond of you again if you are so violent.
7337,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"We have been together too long, and we may be noticed."
7338,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7339,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"_Dante._ Is this our last meeting? If it is ... and that it is, my"
7340,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"heart has told me ... you will not, surely you will not refuse...."
7341,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7342,DANTE AND BEATRICE,_Beatrice._ Dante! Dante! they make the heart sad after: do not wish
7343,DANTE AND BEATRICE,"it. But prayers ... oh, how much better are they, how much quieter and"
7344,DANTE AND BEATRICE,lighter they render it! They carry it up to heaven with them; and
7345,DANTE AND BEATRICE,those we love are left behind no longer.
7346,DANTE AND BEATRICE,
7347,DANTE AND BEATRICE,

7352,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7353,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Filippo! I am informed by my son Cosimo de' Medici of many
7354,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"things relating to thy life and actions, and among the rest, of thy"
7355,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,throwing off the habit of a friar. Speak to me as to a friend. Was

7357,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7358,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Holy Father! it was done most unadvisedly.
7359,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7360,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Continue to treat me with the same confidence and

7365,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,contentment.
7366,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7367,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ Infinite thanks, Holy Father! from the innermost heart of"
7368,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"your unworthy servant, whose duty and wishes bind him alike and"
7369,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,equally to a strict compliance with your paternal commands.
7370,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7371,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Was it a love of the world and its vanities that induced
7372,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,thee to throw aside the frock?
7373,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7374,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ It was indeed, Holy Father! I never had the courage to"
7375,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,mention it in confession among my manifold offences.
7376,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7377,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Bad! bad! Repentance is of little use to the sinner,"
7378,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,unless he pour it from a full and overflowing heart into the capacious
7379,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,ear of the confessor. Ye must not go straightforward and bluntly up to
7380,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"your Maker, startling Him with the horrors of your guilty conscience."
7381,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"Order, decency, time, place, opportunity, must be observed."
7382,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7383,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ I have observed the greater part of them: time, place, and"
7384,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,opportunity.
7385,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7386,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ That is much. In consideration of it, I hereby absolve"
7387,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,thee.
7388,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7389,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ I feel quite easy, quite new-born."
7390,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7391,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ I am desirous of hearing what sort of feelings thou
7392,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"experiencest, when thou givest loose to thy intractable and unruly"
7393,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"wishes. Now, this love of the world, what can it mean? A love of"
7394,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"music, of dancing, of riding? What in short is it in thee?"
7395,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7396,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Holy Father! I was ever of a hot and amorous constitution.
7397,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7398,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Well, well! I can guess, within a trifle, what that leads"
7399,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"unto. I very much disapprove of it, whatever it may be. And then? and"
7400,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,then? Prithee go on: I am inflamed with a miraculous zeal to cleanse
7401,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,thee.
7402,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7403,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ I have committed many follies, and some sins."
7404,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7405,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Let me hear the sins; I do not trouble my head about the
7406,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,follies; the Church has no business with them. The State is founded on
7407,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"follies, the Church on sins. Come then, unsack them."
7408,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7409,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Concupiscence is both a folly and a sin. I felt more and
7410,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"more of it when I ceased to be a monk, not having (for a time) so"
7411,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,ready means of allaying it.
7412,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7413,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ No doubt. Thou shouldst have thought again and again
7414,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,before thou strippedst off the cowl.
7415,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7416,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Ah! Holy Father! I am sore at heart. I thought indeed how
7417,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"often it had held two heads together under it, and that stripping it"
7418,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"off was double decapitation. But compensation and contentment came,"
7419,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,and we were warm enough without it.
7420,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7421,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ I am minded to reprove thee gravely. No wonder it pleased
7422,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"the Virgin, and the saints about her, to permit that the enemy of our"
7423,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,faith should lead thee captive into Barbary.
7424,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7425,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ The pleasure was all on their side.
7426,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7427,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ I have heard a great many stories both of males and
7428,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,females who were taken by Tunisians and Algerines: and although there
7429,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"is a sameness in certain parts of them, my especial benevolence toward"
7430,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"thee, worthy Filippo, would induce me to lend a vacant ear to thy"
7431,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"report. And now, good Filippo, I could sip a small glass of Muscatel"
7432,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"or Orvieto, and turn over a few bleached almonds, or essay a smart"
7433,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"dried apricot at intervals, and listen while thou relatest to me the"
7434,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"manners and customs of that country, and particularly as touching thy"
7435,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"own adversities. First, how wast thou taken?"
7436,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7437,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ I was visiting at Pesaro my worshipful friend the canonico
7438,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"Andrea Paccone, who delighted in the guitar, played it skilfully, and"
7439,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,was always fond of hearing it well accompanied by the voice. My own
7440,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"instrument I had brought with me, together with many gay Florentine"
7441,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"songs, some of which were of such a turn and tendency, that the"
7442,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"canonico thought they would sound better on water, and rather far from"
7443,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"shore, than within the walls of the canonicate. He proposed then, one"
7444,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"evening when there was little wind stirring, to exercise three young"
7445,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"abbates[9] on their several parts, a little way out of hearing from"
7446,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,the water's edge.
7447,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7448,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ I disapprove of exercising young abbates in that manner.
7449,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7450,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ Inadvertently, O Holy Father! I have made the affair seem"
7451,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"worse than it really was. In fact, there were only two genuine"
7452,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"abbates; the third was Donna Lisetta, the good canonico's pretty"
7453,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"niece, who looks so archly at your Holiness when you bend your knees"
7454,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,before her at bedtime.
7455,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7456,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ How? Where?
7457,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7458,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ She is the angel on the right-hand side of the Holy Family,"
7459,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,with a tip of amethyst-coloured wing over a basket of figs and
7460,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"pomegranates. I painted her from memory: she was then only fifteen,"
7461,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,and worthy to be the niece of an archbishop. Alas! she never will be:
7462,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"she plays and sings among the infidels, and perhaps would eat a"
7463,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,landrail on a Friday as unreluctantly as she would a roach.
7464,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7465,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Poor soul! So this is the angel with the amethyst-coloured
7466,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,wing? I thought she looked wanton: we must pray for her release ...
7467,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,from the bondage of sin. What followed in your excursion?
7468,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7469,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ Singing, playing, fresh air, and plashing water, stimulated"
7470,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,our appetites. We had brought no eatable with us but fruit and thin
7471,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_marzopane_, of which the sugar and rose-water were inadequate to ward"
7472,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"off hunger; and the sight of a fishing-vessel between us and Ancona,"
7473,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"raised our host immoderately. 'Yonder smack,' said he, 'is sailing at"
7474,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,this moment just over the best sole-bank in the Adriatic. If she
7475,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"continues her course and we run toward her, we may be supplied, I"
7476,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"trust in God, with the finest fish in Christendom. Methinks I see"
7477,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"already the bellies of those magnificent sole bestar the deck, and"
7478,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,emulate the glories of the orient sky.' He gave his orders with such a
7479,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"majestic air, that he looked rather like an admiral than a priest."
7480,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7481,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ How now, rogue! Why should not the churchman look"
7482,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"majestically and courageously? I myself have found occasion for it,"
7483,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,and exerted it.
7484,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7485,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ The world knows the prowess of your Holiness.
7486,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7487,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Not mine, not mine, Filippo! but His who gave me the sword"
7488,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"and the keys, and the will and the discretion to use them. I trust the"
7489,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"canonico did not misapply his station and power, by taking the fish at"
7490,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,any unreasonably low price; and that he gave his blessing to the
7491,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"remainder, and to the poor fishermen and to their nets."
7492,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7493,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ He was angry at observing that the vessel, while he thought"
7494,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"it was within hail, stood out again to sea."
7495,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7496,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ He ought to have borne more manfully so slight a vexation.
7497,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7498,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ On the contrary, he swore bitterly he would have the"
7499,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"master's ear between his thumb and forefinger in another half-hour,"
7500,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,and regretted that he had cut his nails in the morning lest they
7501,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"should grate on his guitar. 'They may fish well,' cried he, 'but they"
7502,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"can neither sail nor row; and, when I am in the middle of that tub of"
7503,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"theirs, I will teach them more than they look for.' Sure enough he was"
7504,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,in the middle of it at the time he fixed: but it was by aid of a rope
7505,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,about his arms and the end of another laid lustily on his back and
7506,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"shoulders. 'Mount, lazy long-chined turnspit, as thou valuest thy"
7507,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"life,' cried Abdul the corsair, 'and away for Tunis.' If silence is"
7508,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"consent, he had it. The captain, in the Sicilian dialect, told us we"
7509,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"might talk freely, for he had taken his siesta. 'Whose guitars are"
7510,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,those?' said he. As the canonico raised his eyes to heaven and
7511,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"answered nothing, I replied, 'Sir, one is mine: the other is my worthy"
7512,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,friend's there.' Next he asked the canonico to what market he was
7513,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"taking those young slaves, pointing to the abbates. The canonico"
7514,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,sobbed and could not utter one word. I related the whole story; at
7515,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"which he laughed. He then took up the music, and commanded my reverend"
7516,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"guest to sing an air peculiarly tender, invoking the compassion of a"
7517,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"nymph, and calling her cold as ice. Never did so many or such profound"
7518,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"sighs accompany it. When it ended, he sang one himself in his own"
7519,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"language, on a lady whose eyes were exactly like the scimitars of"
7520,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"Damascus, and whose eyebrows met in the middle like the cudgels of"
7521,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"prize-fighters. On the whole she resembled both sun and moon, with the"
7522,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"simple difference that she never allowed herself to be seen, lest all"
7523,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"the nations of the earth should go to war for her, and not a man to be"
7524,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,left to breathe out his soul before her. This poem had obtained the
7525,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"prize at the University of Fez, had been translated into the Arabic,"
7526,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"the Persian, and the Turkish languages, and was the favourite lay of"
7527,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,the corsair. He invited me lastly to try my talent. I played the same
7528,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"air on the guitar, and apologized for omitting the words, from my"
7529,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"utter ignorance of the Moorish. Abdul was much pleased, and took the"
7530,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"trouble to convince me that the poetry they conveyed, which he"
7531,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"translated literally, was incomparably better than ours. 'Cold as"
7532,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"ice!' he repeated, scoffing: 'anybody might say that who had seen"
7533,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"Atlas: but a genuine poet would rather say, ""Cold as a lizard or a"
7534,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"lobster.""' There is no controverting a critic who has twenty stout"
7535,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"rowers, and twenty well-knotted rope-ends. Added to which, he seemed"
7536,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,to know as much of the matter as the generality of those who talked
7537,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"about it. He was gratified by my attention and edification, and thus"
7538,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"continued: 'I have remarked in the songs I have heard, that these wild"
7539,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"woodland creatures of the west, these nymphs, are a strange"
7540,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,fantastical race. But are your poets not ashamed to complain of their
7541,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,inconstancy? whose fault is that? If ever it should be my fortune to
7542,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"take one, I would try whether I could not bring her down to the level"
7543,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"of her sex; and if her inconstancy caused any complaints, by Allah!"
7544,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,they should be louder and shriller than ever rose from the throat of
7545,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,Abdul.' I still thought it better to be a disciple than a commentator.
7546,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7547,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ If we could convert this barbarian and detain him awhile
7548,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"at Rome, he would learn that women and nymphs (and inconstancy also)"
7549,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"are one and the same. These cruel men have no lenity, no suavity. They"
7550,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"who do not as they would be done by, are done by very much as they do."
7551,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,Women will glide away from them like water; they can better bear two
7552,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,masters than half one; and a new metal must be discovered before any
7553,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,bars are strong enough to confine them. But proceed with your
7554,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,narrative.
7555,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7556,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Night had now closed upon us. Abdul placed the younger of
7557,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"the company apart, and after giving them some boiled rice, sent them"
7558,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"down into his own cabin. The sailors, observing the consideration and"
7559,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"distinction with which their master had treated me, were civil and"
7560,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"obliging. Permission was granted me, at my request, to sleep on deck."
7561,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7562,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ What became of your canonico?
7563,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7564,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ The crew called him a conger, a priest, and a porpoise."
7565,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7566,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Foul-mouthed knaves! could not one of these terms content
7567,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,them? On thy leaving Barbary was he left behind?
7568,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7569,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ Your Holiness consecrated him, the other day, Bishop of"
7570,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,Macerata.
7571,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7572,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ True, true; I remember the name, Saccone. How did he"
7573,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,contrive to get off?
7574,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7575,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ He was worth little at any work; and such men are the
7576,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,quickest both to get off and to get on. Abdul told me he had received
7577,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,three thousand crowns for his ransom.
7578,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7579,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ He was worth more to him than to me. I received but two
7580,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"first-fruits, and such other things as of right belong to me by"
7581,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,inheritance. The bishopric is passably rich: he may serve thee.
7582,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7583,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ While he was a canonico he was a jolly fellow; not very
7584,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,generous; for jolly fellows are seldom that; but he would give a
7585,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"friend a dinner, a flask of wine or two in preference, and a piece of"
7586,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"advice as readily as either. I waited on monsignor at Macerata, soon"
7587,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,after his elevation.
7588,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7589,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ He must have been heartily glad to embrace his companion
7590,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"in captivity, and the more especially as he himself was the cause of"
7591,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,so grievous a misfortune.
7592,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7593,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ He sent me word he was so unwell he could not see me.
7594,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"'What!' said I to his valet, 'is monsignor's complaint in his eyes?'"
7595,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,The fellow shrugged up his shoulders and walked away. Not believing
7596,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"that the message was a refusal to admit me, I went straight upstairs,"
7597,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"and finding the door of an antechamber half open, and a chaplain"
7598,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"milling an egg-posset over the fire, I accosted him. The air of"
7599,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,familiarity and satisfaction he observed in me left no doubt in his
7600,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,mind that I had been invited by his patron. 'Will the man never come?'
7601,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"cried his lordship. 'Yes, monsignor!' exclaimed I, running in and"
7602,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"embracing him; 'behold him here!' He started back, and then I first"
7603,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,discovered the wide difference between an old friend and an
7604,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,egg-posset.
7605,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7606,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Son Filippo! thou hast seen but little of the world, and"
7607,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,art but just come from Barbary. Go on.
7608,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7609,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ 'Fra Filippo!' said he gravely, 'I am glad to see you. I"
7610,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,did not expect you just at present: I am not very well: I had ordered
7611,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,a medicine and was impatient to take it. If you will favour me with
7612,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"the name of your inn, I will send for you when I am in a condition to"
7613,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"receive you; perhaps within a day or two.' 'Monsignor!' said I, 'a"
7614,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"change of residence often gives a man a cold, and oftener a change of"
7615,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,fortune. Whether you caught yours upon deck (where we last saw each
7616,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"other), from being more exposed than usual, or whether the mitre holds"
7617,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"wind, is no question for me, and no concern of mine.'"
7618,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7619,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ A just reproof, if an archbishop had made it. On uttering"
7620,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"it, I hope thou kneeledst and kissedst his hand."
7621,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7622,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ I did not indeed.
7623,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7624,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Oh, there wert thou greatly in the wrong! Having, it is"
7625,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"reported, a good thousand crowns yearly of patrimony, and a canonicate"
7626,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"worth six hundred more, he might have attempted to relieve thee from"
7627,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"slavery, by assisting thy relatives in thy redemption."
7628,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7629,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ The three thousand crowns were the uttermost he could
7630,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"raise, he declared to Abdul, and he asserted that a part of the money"
7631,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,was contributed by the inhabitants of Pesaro. 'Do they act out of pure
7632,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"mercy?' said he. 'Ay, they must, for what else could move them in"
7633,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"behalf of such a lazy, unserviceable street-fed cur?' In the morning,"
7634,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"at sunrise, he was sent aboard. And now, the vessel being under weigh,"
7635,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"'I have a letter from my lord Abdul,' said the master, 'which, being"
7636,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"in thy language, two fellow slaves shall read unto thee publicly.'"
7637,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,They came forward and began the reading. 'Yesterday I purchased these
7638,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"two slaves from a cruel, unrelenting master, under whose lash they"
7639,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,have laboured for nearly thirty years. I hereby give orders that five
7640,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,ounces of my own gold be weighed out to them.' Here one of the slaves
7641,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"fell on his face; the other lifted up his hands, praised God, and"
7642,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,blessed his benefactor.
7643,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7644,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ The pirate? the unconverted pirate?
7645,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7646,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Even so. 'Here is another slip of paper for thyself to read
7647,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"immediately in my presence,' said the master. The words it contained"
7648,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"were, 'Do thou the same, or there enters thy lips neither food nor"
7649,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,water until thou landest in Italy. I permit thee to carry away more
7650,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,than double the sum: I am no sutler: I do not contract for thy
7651,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,sustenance.' The canonico asked of the master whether he knew the
7652,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"contents of the letter; he replied no. 'Tell your master, lord Abdul,"
7653,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,that I shall take them into consideration.' 'My lord expected a much
7654,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"plainer answer, and commanded me, in case of any such as thou hast"
7655,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"delivered, to break this seal.' He pressed it to his forehead and then"
7656,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"broke it. Having perused the characters reverentially, 'Christian!"
7657,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"dost thou consent?' The canonico fell on his knees, and overthrew the"
7658,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"two poor wretches who, saying their prayers, had remained in the same"
7659,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,posture before him quite unnoticed. 'Open thy trunk and take out thy
7660,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"money-bag, or I will make room for it in thy bladder.' The canonico"
7661,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,was prompt in the execution of the command. The master drew out his
7662,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"scales, and desired the canonico to weigh with his own hand five"
7663,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,ounces. He groaned and trembled: the balance was unsteady. 'Throw in
7664,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"another piece: it will not vitiate the agreement,' cried the master."
7665,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"It was done. Fear and grief are among the thirsty passions, but add"
7666,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"little to the appetite. It seemed, however, as if every sigh had left"
7667,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,a vacancy in the stomach of the canonico. At dinner the cook brought
7668,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"him a salted bonito, half an ell in length; and in five minutes his"
7669,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"reverence was drawing his middle finger along the white backbone, out"
7670,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"of sheer idleness, until were placed before him some as fine dried"
7671,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"locusts as ever provisioned the tents of Africa, together with olives"
7672,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"the size of eggs and colour of bruises, shining in oil and brine. He"
7673,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"found them savoury and pulpy, and, as the last love supersedes the"
7674,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"foregoing, he gave them the preference, even over the delicate"
7675,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"locusts. When he had finished them, he modestly requested a can of"
7676,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"water. A sailor brought a large flask, and poured forth a plentiful"
7677,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"supply. The canonico engulfed the whole, and instantly threw himself"
7678,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,back in convulsive agony. 'How is this?' cried the sailor. The master
7679,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"ran up and, smelling the water, began to buffet him, exclaiming, as he"
7680,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"turned round to all the crew, 'How came this flask here?' All were"
7681,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"innocent. It appeared, however, that it was a flask of mineral water,"
7682,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"strongly sulphureous, taken out of a Neapolitan vessel, laden with a"
7683,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,great abundance of it for some hospital in the Levant. It had taken
7684,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,the captor by surprise in the same manner as the canonico. He himself
7685,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"brought out instantly a capacious stone jar covered with dew, and"
7686,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,invited the sufferer into the cabin. Here he drew forth two richly-cut
7687,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"wineglasses, and, on filling one of them, the outside of it turned"
7688,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"suddenly pale, with a myriad of indivisible drops, and the senses were"
7689,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,refreshed with the most delicious fragrance. He held up the glass
7690,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"between himself and his guest, and looking at it attentively, said,"
7691,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,'Here is no appearance of wine; all I can see is water. Nothing is
7692,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"wickeder than too much curiosity: we must take what Allah sends us,"
7693,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"and render thanks for it, although it fall far short of our"
7694,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"expectations. Besides, our Prophet would rather we should even drink"
7695,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,wine than poison.' The canonico had not tasted wine for two months: a
7696,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,longer abstinence than ever canonico endured before. He drooped: but
7697,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,the master looked still more disconsolate. 'I would give whatever I
7698,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"possess on earth rather than die of thirst,' cried the canonico. 'Who"
7699,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"would not?' rejoined the captain, sighing and clasping his fingers."
7700,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"'If it were not contrary to my commands, I could touch at some cove or"
7701,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"inlet.' 'Do, for the love of Christ!' exclaimed the canonico. 'Or even"
7702,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"sail back,' continued the captain. 'O Santa Vergine!' cried in anguish"
7703,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"the canonico. 'Despondency,' said the captain, with calm solemnity,"
7704,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,'has left many a man to be thrown overboard: it even renders the
7705,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"plague, and many other disorders, more fatal. Thirst too has a"
7706,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"powerful effect in exasperating them. Overcome such weaknesses, or I"
7707,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,must do my duty. The health of the ship's company is placed under my
7708,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"care; and our lord Abdul, if he suspected the pest, would throw a Jew,"
7709,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"or a Christian, or even a bale of silk, into the sea: such is the"
7710,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,disinterestedness and magnanimity of my lord Abdul.' 'He believes in
7711,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,fate; does he not?' said the canonico. 'Doubtless: but he says it is
7712,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,as much fated that he should throw into the sea a fellow who is
7713,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"infected, as that the fellow should have ever been so.' 'Save me, oh,"
7714,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"save me!' cried the canonico, moist as if the spray had pelted him."
7715,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"'Willingly, if possible,' answered calmly the master. 'At present I"
7716,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"can discover no certain symptoms; for sweat, unless followed by"
7717,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"general prostration, both of muscular strength and animal spirits, may"
7718,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,be cured without a hook at the heel.' 'Giesu-Maria!' ejaculated the
7719,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,canonico.
7720,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7721,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ And the monster could withstand that appeal?
7722,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7723,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ It seems so. The renegade who related to me, on my return,"
7724,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"these events as they happened, was very circumstantial. He is a"
7725,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"Corsican, and had killed many men in battle, and more out; but is (he"
7726,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,gave me his word for it) on the whole an honest man.
7727,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7728,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ How so? honest? and a renegade?
7729,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7730,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ He declared to me that, although the Mahomedan is the best"
7731,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"religion to live in, the Christian is the best to die in; and that,"
7732,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"when he has made his fortune, he will make his confession, and lie"
7733,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,snugly in the bosom of the Church.
7734,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7735,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ See here the triumphs of our holy faith! The lost sheep
7736,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,will be found again.
7737,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7738,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Having played the butcher first.
7739,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7740,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Return we to that bad man, the master or captain, who"
7741,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,evinced no such dispositions.
7742,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7743,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ He added, 'The other captives, though older men, have"
7744,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"stouter hearts than mine.' 'Alas! they are longer used to hardships,'"
7745,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"answered he. 'Dost thou believe, in thy conscience,' said the captain,"
7746,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,'that the water we have aboard would be harmless to them? for we have
7747,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,no other; and wine is costly; and our quantity might be insufficient
7748,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,for those who can afford to pay for it.' 'I will answer for their
7749,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"lives,' replied the canonico. 'With thy own?' interrogated sharply the"
7750,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"Tunisian. 'I must not tempt God,' said, in tears, the religious man."
7751,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"'Let us be plain,' said the master. 'Thou knowest thy money is safe; I"
7752,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,myself counted it before thee when I brought it from the scrivener's;
7753,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"thou hast sixty broad gold pieces; wilt thou be answerable, to the"
7754,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"whole amount of them, for the lives of thy two countrymen if they"
7755,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"drink this water?' 'O sir!' said the canonico, 'I will give it, if,"
7756,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"only for these few days of voyage, you vouchsafe me one bottle daily"
7757,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,of that restorative wine of Bordeaux. The other two are less liable to
7758,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,the plague: they do not sorrow and sweat as I do. They are spare men.
7759,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,There is enough of me to infect a fleet with it; and I cannot bear to
7760,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,think of being in any wise the cause of evil to my fellow-creatures.'
7761,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"'The wine is my patron's,' cried the Tunisian; 'he leaves everything"
7762,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,at my discretion: should I deceive him?' 'If he leaves everything at
7763,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"your discretion,' observed the logician of Pesaro, 'there is no deceit"
7764,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,in disposing of it.' The master appeared to be satisfied with the
7765,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"argument. 'Thou shalt not find me exacting,' said he; 'give me the"
7766,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"sixty pieces, and the wine shall be thine.' At a signal, when the"
7767,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"contract was agreed to, the two slaves entered, bringing a hamper of"
7768,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"jars. 'Read the contract before thou signest,' cried the master. He"
7769,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,read. 'How is this? how is this? _Sixty golden ducats to the brothers
7770,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"Antonio and Bernabo Panini, for wine received from them?_' The aged"
7771,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"men tottered under the stroke of joy; and Bernabo, who would have"
7772,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"embraced his brother, fainted."
7773,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7774,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"On the morrow there was a calm, and the weather was extremely sultry."
7775,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"The canonico sat in his shirt on deck, and was surprised to see, I"
7776,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"forget which of the brothers, drink from a goblet a prodigious draught"
7777,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,of water. 'Hold!' cried he angrily; 'you may eat instead; but putrid
7778,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"or sulphureous water, you have heard, may produce the plague, and"
7779,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,honest men be the sufferers by your folly and intemperance.' They
7780,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"assured him the water was tasteless, and very excellent, and had been"
7781,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"kept cool in the same kind of earthern jars as the wine. He tasted it,"
7782,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"and lost his patience. It was better, he protested, than any wine in"
7783,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,the world. They begged his acceptance of the jar containing it. But
7784,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"the master, who had witnessed at a distance the whole proceeding, now"
7785,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"advanced, and, placing his hand against it, said sternly, 'Let him"
7786,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"have his own.' Usually, when he had emptied the second bottle, a"
7787,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,desire of converting the Mohammedans came over him: and they showed
7788,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,themselves much less obstinate and refractory than they are generally
7789,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,thought. He selected those for edification who swore the oftenest and
7790,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,the loudest by the Prophet; and he boasted in his heart of having
7791,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"overcome, by precept and example, the stiffest tenet of their"
7792,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"abominable creed. Certainly they drank wine, and somewhat freely. The"
7793,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"canonico clapped his hands, and declared that even some of the"
7794,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,apostles had been more pertinacious recusants of the faith.
7795,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7796,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Did he so? Cappari! I would not have made him a bishop for
7797,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,twice the money if I had known it earlier. Could not he have left them
7798,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"alone? Suppose one or other of them did doubt and persecute, was he"
7799,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,the man to blab it out among the heathen?
7800,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7801,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ A judgment, it appears, fell on him for so doing. A very"
7802,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"quiet sailor, who had always declined his invitations, and had always"
7803,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"heard his arguments at a distance and in silence, being pressed and"
7804,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"urged by him, and reproved somewhat arrogantly and loudly, as less"
7805,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"docile than his messmates, at last lifted up his leg behind him,"
7806,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"pulled off his right slipper, and counted deliberately and distinctly"
7807,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"thirty-nine sound strokes of the same, on the canonico's broadest"
7808,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"tablet, which (please your Holiness) might be called, not inaptly,"
7809,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,from that day the tablet of memory. In vain he cried out. Some of the
7810,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,mariners made their moves at chess and waved their left hands as if
7811,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,desirous of no interruption; others went backward and forward about
7812,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"their business, and took no more notice than if their messmate was"
7813,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"occupied in caulking a seam or notching a flint. The master himself,"
7814,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"who saw the operation, heard the complaint in the evening, and lifted"
7815,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"up his shoulders and eyebrows, as if the whole were quite unknown to"
7816,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"him. Then, acting as judge-advocate, he called the young man before"
7817,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,him and repeated the accusation. To this the defence was purely
7818,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,interrogative. 'Why would he convert me? I never converted him.'
7819,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"Turning to his spiritual guide, he said, 'I quite forgive thee: nay, I"
7820,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"am ready to appear in thy favour, and to declare that, in general,"
7821,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,thou hast been more decorous than people of thy faith and profession
7822,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"usually are, and hast not scattered on deck that inflammatory language"
7823,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"which I, habited in the dress of a Greek, heard last Easter. I went"
7824,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,into three churches; and the preachers in all three denounced the
7825,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,curse of Allah on every soul that differed from them a tittle. They
7826,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"were children of perdition, children of darkness, children of the"
7827,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"devil, one and all. It seemed a matter of wonder to me, that, in such"
7828,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"numerous families and of such indifferent parentage, so many slippers"
7829,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"were kept under the heel. Mine, in an evil hour, escaped me: but I"
7830,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,quite forgive thee. After this free pardon I will indulge thee with a
7831,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,short specimen of my preaching. I will call none of you a generation
7832,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"of vipers, as ye call one another; for vipers neither bite nor eat"
7833,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,during many months of the year: I will call none of you wolves in
7834,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"sheep's clothing; for if ye are, it must be acknowledged that the"
7835,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"clothing is very clumsily put on. You priests, however, take people's"
7836,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"souls aboard whether they will or not, just as we do your bodies: and"
7837,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,you make them pay much more for keeping these in slavery than we make
7838,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,you pay for setting you free body and soul together. You declare that
7839,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"the precious souls, to the especial care of which Allah has called and"
7840,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"appointed you, frequently grow corrupt, and stink in His nostrils."
7841,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"Now, I invoke thy own testimony to the fact that thy soul, gross as I"
7842,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"imagine it to be from the greasy wallet that holds it, had no carnal"
7843,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"thoughts whatsoever, and that thy carcass did not even receive a"
7844,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"fly-blow, while it was under my custody. Thy guardian angel (I speak"
7845,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"it in humility) could not ventilate thee better. Nevertheless, I"
7846,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"should scorn to demand a single maravedi for my labour and skill, or"
7847,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"for the wear and tear of my pantoufle. My reward will be in Paradise,"
7848,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"where a houri is standing in the shade, above a vase of gold and"
7849,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"silver fish, with a kiss on her lip, and an unbroken pair of green"
7850,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"slippers in her hand for me.' Saying which, he took off his foot"
7851,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"again, the one he had been using, and showed the sole of it, first to"
7852,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"the master, then to all the crew, and declared it had become (as they"
7853,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"might see) so smooth and oily by the application, that it was"
7854,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,dangerous to walk on deck in it.
7855,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7856,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ See! what notions these creatures have, both of their"
7857,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"fool's paradise and of our holy faith! The seven Sacraments, I warrant"
7858,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"you, go for nothing! Purgatory, purgatory itself, goes for nothing!"
7859,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7860,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Holy Father! we must stop thee. _That_ does not go for
7861,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"nothing, however."
7862,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7863,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Filippo! God forbid I should suspect thee of any heretical
7864,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"taint; but this smells very like it. If thou hast it now, tell me"
7865,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"honestly. I mean, hold thy tongue. Florentines are rather lax. Even"
7866,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,Son Cosimo might be stricter: so they say: perhaps his enemies. The
7867,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"great always have them abundantly, beside those by whom they are"
7868,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"served, and those also whom they serve. Now would I give a silver"
7869,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"rose with my benediction on it, to know of a certainty what became of"
7870,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,those poor creatures the abbates. The initiatory rite of Mohammedanism
7871,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,is most diabolically malicious. According to the canons of our
7872,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"Catholic Church, it disqualifies the neophyte for holy orders, without"
7873,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,going so far as adapting him to the choir of the pontifical chapel.
7874,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,They limp; they halt.
7875,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7876,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Beatitude! which of them?
7877,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7878,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ The unbelievers: they surely are found wanting.
7879,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7880,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ The unbelievers too?
7881,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7882,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Ay, ay, thou half renegade! Couldst not thou go over with"
7883,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"a purse of silver, and try whether the souls of these captives be"
7884,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"recoverable? Even if they should have submitted to such unholy rites,"
7885,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,I venture to say they have repented.
7886,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7887,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ The devil is in them if they have not.
7888,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7889,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ They may become again as good Christians as before.
7890,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7891,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ Easily, methinks."
7892,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7893,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Not so easily; but by aid of Holy Church in the
7894,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,administration of indulgences.
7895,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7896,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ They never wanted those, whatever they want."
7897,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7898,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ The corsair then is not one of those ferocious creatures
7899,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,which appear to connect our species with the lion and panther.
7900,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7901,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ By no means, Holy Father! He is an honest man; so are many"
7902,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"of his countrymen, bating the Sacrament."
7903,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7904,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Bating! poor beguiled Filippo! Being unbaptized, they are"
7905,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,only as the beasts that perish: nay worse: for the soul being
7906,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"imperishable, it must stick to their bodies at the last day, whether"
7907,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"they will or no, and must sink with it into the fire and brimstone."
7908,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7909,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ Unbaptized! why, they baptize every morning."
7910,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7911,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Worse and worse! I thought they only missed the stirrup;
7912,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,I find they overleap the saddle. Obstinate blind reprobates! of whom
7913,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"it is written ... of whom it is written ... of whom, I say, it is"
7914,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,written ... as shall be manifest before men and angels in the day of
7915,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,wrath.
7916,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7917,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ More is the pity! for they are hospitable, frank, and"
7918,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"courteous. It is delightful to see their gardens, when one has not the"
7919,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,weeding and irrigation of them. What fruit! what foliage! what
7920,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,trellises! what alcoves! what a contest of rose and jessamine for
7921,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,supremacy in odour! of lute and nightingale for victory in song! And
7922,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"how the little bright ripples of the docile brooks, the fresher for"
7923,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"their races, leap up against one another, to look on! and how they"
7924,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"chirrup and applaud, as if they too had a voice of some importance in"
7925,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,these parties of pleasure that are loath to separate.
7926,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7927,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Parties of pleasure! birds, fruits, shallow-running"
7928,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"waters, lute-players, and wantons! Parties of pleasure! and composed"
7929,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"of these! Tell me now, Filippo, tell me truly, what complexion in"
7930,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,general have the discreeter females of that hapless country.
7931,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7932,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ The colour of an orange-flower, on which an overladen bee"
7933,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,has left a slight suffusion of her purest honey.
7934,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7935,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ We must open their eyes.
7936,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7937,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Knowing what excellent hides the slippers of this people
7938,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"are made of, I never once ventured on their less perfect theology,"
7939,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,fearing to find it written that I should be abed on my face the next
7940,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,fortnight. My master had expressed his astonishment that a religion so
7941,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,admirable as ours was represented should be the only one in the world
7942,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,the precepts of which are disregarded by all conditions of men. 'Our
7943,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"Prophet,' said he, 'our Prophet ordered us to go forth and conquer; we"
7944,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"did it: yours ordered you to sit quiet and forbear; and, after"
7945,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"spitting in His face, you threw the order back into it, and fought"
7946,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,like devils.'
7947,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7948,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ The barbarians talk of our Holy Scriptures as if they
7949,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,understood them perfectly. The impostor they follow has nothing but
7950,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,fustian and rodomontade in his impudent lying book from beginning to
7951,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"end. I know it, Filippo, from those who have contrasted it, page by"
7952,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"page, paragraph by paragraph, and have given the knave his due."
7953,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7954,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Abdul is by no means deficient in a good opinion of his own
7955,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"capacity and his Prophet's all-sufficiency, but he never took me to"
7956,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,task about my faith or his own.
7957,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7958,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ How wert thou mainly occupied?
7959,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7960,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ I will give your Holiness a sample both of my employments
7961,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"and of his character. He was going one evening to a country-house,"
7962,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,about fifteen miles from Tunis; and he ordered me to accompany him. I
7963,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"found there a spacious garden, overrun with wild flowers and most"
7964,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"luxuriant grass, in irregular tufts, according to the dryness or the"
7965,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,humidity of the spot. The clematis overtopped the lemon and
7966,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"orange-trees; and the perennial pea sent forth here a pink blossom,"
7967,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"here a purple, here a white one, and after holding (as it were) a"
7968,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"short conversation with the humbler plants, sprang up about an old"
7969,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"cypress, played among its branches, and mitigated its gloom. White"
7970,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"pigeons, and others in colour like the dawn of day, looked down on us"
7971,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"and ceased to coo, until some of their companions, in whom they had"
7972,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"more confidence, encouraged them loudly from remoter boughs, or"
7973,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"alighted on the shoulders of Abdul, at whose side I was standing. A"
7974,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,few of them examined me in every position their inquisitive eyes could
7975,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"take; displaying all the advantages of their versatile necks, and"
7976,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,pretending querulous fear in the midst of petulant approaches.
7977,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7978,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Is it of pigeons thou art talking, O Filippo? I hope it"
7979,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,may be.
7980,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7981,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Of Abdul's pigeons. He was fond of taming all creatures;
7982,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"men, horses, pigeons, equally: but he tamed them all by kindness. In"
7983,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,this wilderness is an edifice not unlike our Italian chapter-houses
7984,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"built by the Lombards, with long narrow windows, high above the"
7985,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"ground. The centre is now a bath, the waters of which, in another part"
7986,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"of the enclosure, had supplied a fountain, at present in ruins, and"
7987,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"covered by tufted canes, and by every variety of aquatic plants. The"
7988,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"structure has no remains of roof: and, of six windows, one alone is"
7989,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"unconcealed by ivy. This had been walled up long ago, and the cement"
7990,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"in the inside of it was hard and polished. 'Lippi!' said Abdul to me,"
7991,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"after I had long admired the place in silence, 'I leave to thy"
7992,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,superintendence this bath and garden. Be sparing of the leaves and
7993,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,branches: make paths only wide enough for me. Let me see no mark of
7994,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"hatchet or pruning-hook, and tell the labourers that whoever takes a"
7995,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,nest or an egg shall be impaled.'
7996,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
7997,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Monster! so then he would really have impaled a poor
7998,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,wretch for eating a bird's egg? How disproportionate is the punishment
7999,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,to the offence!
8000,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8001,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ He efficiently checked in his slaves the desire of
8002,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"transgressing his command. To spare them as much as possible, I"
8003,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"ordered them merely to open a few spaces, and to remove the weaker"
8004,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,trees from the stronger. Meanwhile I drew on the smooth blank window
8005,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,the figure of Abdul and of a beautiful girl.
8006,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8007,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Rather say handmaiden: choicer expression; more decorous.
8008,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8009,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ Holy Father! I have been lately so much out of practice, I"
8010,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,take the first that comes in my way. Handmaiden I will use in
8011,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,preference for the future.
8012,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8013,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ On then! and God speed thee!
8014,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8015,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ I drew Abdul with a blooming handmaiden. One of his feet
8016,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"is resting on her lap, and she is drying the ankle with a saffron"
8017,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"robe, of which the greater part is fallen in doing it. That she is a"
8018,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"bondmaid is discernible, not only by her occupation, but by her"
8019,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"humility and patience, by her loose and flowing brown hair, and by her"
8020,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,eyes expressing the timidity at once of servitude and of fondness. The
8021,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"countenance was taken from fancy, and was the loveliest I could"
8022,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"imagine: of the figure I had some idea, having seen it to advantage in"
8023,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,Tunis. After seven days Abdul returned. He was delighted with the
8024,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,improvement made in the garden. I requested him to visit the bath. 'We
8025,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"can do nothing to that,' answered he impatiently. 'There is no"
8026,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"sudatory, no dormitory, no dressing-room, no couch. Sometimes I sit an"
8027,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"hour there in the summer, because I never found a fly in it--the"
8028,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"principal curse of hot countries, and against which plague there is"
8029,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"neither prayer nor amulet, nor indeed any human defence.' He went away"
8030,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,into the house. At dinner he sent me from his table some quails and
8031,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"ortolans, and tomatoes and honey and rice, beside a basket of fruit"
8032,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"covered with moss and bay-leaves, under which I found a verdino fig,"
8033,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"deliciously ripe, and bearing the impression of several small teeth,"
8034,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,but certainly no reptile's.
8035,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8036,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ There might have been poison in them, for all that."
8037,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8038,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ About two hours had passed, when I heard a whir and a crash"
8039,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"in the windows of the bath (where I had dined and was about to sleep),"
8040,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,occasioned by the settling and again the flight of some pheasants.
8041,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,Abdul entered. 'Beard of the Prophet! what hast thou been doing? That
8042,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"is myself! No, no, Lippi! thou never canst have seen her: the face"
8043,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,proves it: but those limbs! thou hast divined them aright: thou hast
8044,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,had sweet dreams then! Dreams are large possessions: in them the
8045,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"possessor may cease to possess his own. To the slave, O Allah! to the"
8046,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,slave is permitted what is not his!... I burn with anguish to think
8047,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"how much ... yea, at that very hour. I would not another should, even"
8048,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"in a dream.... But, Lippi! thou never canst have seen above the"
8049,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"sandal?' To which I answered, 'I never have allowed my eyes to look"
8050,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"even on that. But if any one of my lord Abdul's fair slaves resembles,"
8051,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"as they surely must all do, in duty and docility, the figure I have"
8052,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"represented, let it express to him my congratulation on his"
8053,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"happiness.' 'I believe,' said he, 'such representations are forbidden"
8054,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"by the Koran; but as I do not remember it, I do not sin. There it"
8055,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"shall stay, unless the angel Gabriel comes to forbid it.' He smiled in"
8056,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,saying so.
8057,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8058,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ There is hope of this Abdul. His faith hangs about him
8059,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,more like oil than pitch.
8060,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8061,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ He inquired of me whether I often thought of those I loved
8062,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"in Italy, and whether I could bring them before my eyes at will. To"
8063,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"remove all suspicion from him, I declared I always could, and that one"
8064,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,beautiful object occupied all the cells of my brain by night and day.
8065,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"He paused and pondered, and then said, 'Thou dost not love deeply.' I"
8066,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"thought I had given the true signs. 'No, Lippi! we who love ardently,"
8067,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"we, with all our wishes, all the efforts of our souls, cannot bring"
8068,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"before us the features which, while they were present, we thought it"
8069,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"impossible we ever could forget. Alas! when we most love the absent,"
8070,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"when we most desire to see her, we try in vain to bring her image back"
8071,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"to us. The troubled heart shakes and confounds it, even as ruffled"
8072,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,waters do with shadows. Hateful things are more hateful when they
8073,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"haunt our sleep: the lovely flee away, or are changed into less"
8074,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,lovely.'
8075,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8076,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ What figures now have these unbelievers?
8077,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8078,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Various in their combinations as the letters or the
8079,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"numerals; but they all, like these, signify something. Almeida (did I"
8080,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,not inform your Holiness?) has large hazel eyes....
8081,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8082,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Has she? thou never toldest me that. Well, well! and what"
8083,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,else has she? Mind! be cautious! use decent terms.
8084,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8085,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Somewhat pouting lips.
8086,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8087,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Ha! ha! What did they pout at?
8088,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8089,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ And she is rather plump than otherwise.
8090,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8091,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ No harm in that.
8092,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8093,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ And moreover is cool, smooth, and firm as a nectarine"
8094,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,gathered before sunrise.
8095,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8096,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Ha! ha! do not remind me of nectarines. I am very fond of
8097,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,them; and this is not the season! Such females as thou describest are
8098,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,said to be among the likeliest to give reasonable cause for suspicion.
8099,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"I would not judge harshly, I would not think uncharitably; but,"
8100,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"unhappily, being at so great a distance from spiritual aid,"
8101,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"peradventure a desire, a suggestion, an inkling ... ay? If she, the"
8102,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"lost Almeida, came before thee when her master was absent ... which I"
8103,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,trust she never did.... But those flowers and shrubs and odours and
8104,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"alleys and long grass and alcoves, might strangely hold, perplex, and"
8105,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"entangle, two incautious young persons ... ay?"
8106,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8107,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ I confessed all I had to confess in this matter the evening
8108,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,I landed.
8109,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8110,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Ho! I am no candidate for a seat at the rehearsal of
8111,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,confessions: but perhaps my absolution might be somewhat more pleasing
8112,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"and unconditional. Well! well! since I am unworthy of such confidence,"
8113,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,go about thy business ... paint! paint!
8114,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8115,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Am I so unfortunate as to have offended your Beatitude?
8116,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8117,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Offend _me_, man! who offends _me_? I took an interest in"
8118,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"thy adventures, and was concerned lest thou mightest have sinned; for"
8119,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,by my soul! Filippo! those are the women that the devil hath set his
8120,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,mark on.
8121,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8122,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ It would do your Holiness's heart good to rub it out again,"
8123,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,wherever he may have had the cunning to make it.
8124,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8125,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Deep! deep!
8126,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8127,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ Yet it may be got at; she being a Biscayan by birth, as she"
8128,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"told me, and not only baptized, but going by sea along the coast for"
8129,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"confirmation, when she was captured."
8130,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8131,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Alas! to what an imposition of hands was this tender young
8132,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,thing devoted! Poor soul!
8133,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8134,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ I sigh for her myself when I think of her.
8135,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8136,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Beware lest the sigh be mundane, and lest the thought"
8137,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,recur too often. I wish it were presently in my power to examine her
8138,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,myself on her condition. What thinkest thou? Speak.
8139,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8140,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Holy Father! she would laugh in your face.
8141,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8142,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ So lost!
8143,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8144,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ She declared to me she thought she should have died, from"
8145,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,the instant she was captured until she was comforted by Abdul: but
8146,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,that she was quite sure she should if she were ransomed.
8147,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8148,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Has the wretch then shaken her faith?
8149,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8150,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ The very last thing he would think of doing. Never did I
8151,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,see the virtue of resignation in higher perfection than in the
8152,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"laughing, light-hearted Almeida."
8153,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8154,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Lamentable! Poor lost creature! lost in this world and in
8155,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,the next.
8156,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8157,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ What could she do? how could she help herself?
8158,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8159,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ She might have torn his eyes out, and have died a martyr."
8160,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8161,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ Or have been bastinadoed, whipped, and given up to the"
8162,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,cooks and scullions for it.
8163,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8164,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Martyrdom is the more glorious the greater the indignities
8165,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,it endures.
8166,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8167,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Almeida seems unambitious. There are many in our Tuscany
8168,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"who would jump at the crown over those sloughs and briers, rather than"
8169,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,perish without them: she never sighs after the like.
8170,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8171,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Nevertheless, what must she witness! what abominations!"
8172,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,what superstitions!
8173,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8174,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Abdul neither practises nor exacts any other superstition
8175,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,than ablutions.
8176,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8177,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Detestable rites! without our authority. I venture to
8178,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"affirm that, in the whole of Italy and Spain, no convent of monks or"
8179,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,nuns contains a bath; and that the worst inmate of either would
8180,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,shudder at the idea of observing such a practice in common with the
8181,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,unbeliever. For the washing of the feet indeed we have the authority
8182,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,of the earlier Christians; and it may be done; but solemnly and
8183,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"sparingly. Thy residence among the Mahomedans, I am afraid, hath"
8184,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"rendered thee more favourable to them than beseems a Catholic, and thy"
8185,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"mind, I do suspect, sometimes goes back into Barbary unreluctantly."
8186,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8187,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ While I continued in that country, although I was well"
8188,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"treated, I often wished myself away, thinking of my friends in"
8189,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"Florence, of music, of painting, of our villeggiatura at the"
8190,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"vintage-time; whether in the green and narrow glades of Pratolino,"
8191,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"with lofty trees above us, and little rills unseen, and little bells"
8192,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"about the necks of sheep and goats, tinkling together ambiguously; or"
8193,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"amid the grey quarries, or under the majestic walls of modern Fiesole;"
8194,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"or down in the woods of the Doccia, where the cypresses are of such a"
8195,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"girth that, when a youth stands against one of them, and a maiden"
8196,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"stands opposite, and they clasp it, their hands at the time do little"
8197,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"more than meet. Beautiful scenes, on which heaven smiles eternally,"
8198,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,how often has my heart ached for you! He who hath lived in this
8199,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,country can enjoy no distant one. He breathes here another air; he
8200,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"lives more life; a brighter sun invigorates his studies, and serener"
8201,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,stars influence his repose. Barbary hath also the blessing of climate;
8202,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"and although I do not desire to be there again, I feel sometimes a"
8203,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,kind of regret at leaving it. A bell warbles the more mellifluously in
8204,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"the air when the sound of the stroke is over, and when another swims"
8205,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"out from underneath it, and pants upon the element that gave it birth."
8206,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,In like manner the recollection of a thing is frequently more pleasing
8207,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,than the actuality; what is harsh is dropped in the space between.
8208,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,There is in Abdul a nobility of soul on which I often have reflected
8209,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,with admiration. I have seen many of the highest rank and
8210,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"distinction, in whom I could find nothing of the great man, excepting"
8211,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"a fondness for low company, and an aptitude to shy and start at every"
8212,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,spark of genius or virtue that sprang up above or before them. Abdul
8213,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"was solitary, but affable: he was proud, but patient and complacent. I"
8214,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,ventured once to ask him how the master of so rich a house in the
8215,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"city, of so many slaves, of so many horses and mules, of such"
8216,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"cornfields, of such pastures, of such gardens, woods, and fountains,"
8217,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,should experience any delight or satisfaction in infesting the open
8218,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"sea, the high-road of nations. Instead of answering my question, he"
8219,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,asked me in return whether I would not respect any relative of mine
8220,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"who avenged his country, enriched himself by his bravery, and endeared"
8221,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,to him his friends and relatives by his bounty. On my reply in the
8222,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"affirmative, he said that his family had been deprived of possessions"
8223,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,in Spain much more valuable than all the ships and cargoes he could
8224,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"ever hope to capture, and that the remains of his nation were"
8225,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"threatened with ruin and expulsion. 'I do not fight,' said he,"
8226,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"'whenever it suits the convenience, or gratifies the malignity, or the"
8227,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"caprice of two silly, quarrelsome princes, drawing my sword in"
8228,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"perfectly good humour, and sheathing it again at word of command, just"
8229,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,when I begin to get into a passion. No; I fight on my own account; not
8230,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"as a hired assassin, or still baser journeyman.'"
8231,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8232,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ It appears then really that the Infidels have some
8233,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,semblances of magnanimity and generosity?
8234,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8235,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ I thought so when I turned over the many changes of fine
8236,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,linen; and I was little short of conviction when I found at the bottom
8237,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,of my chest two hundred Venetian zecchins.
8238,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8239,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Corpo di Bacco! Better things, far better things, I would"
8240,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"fain do for thee, not exactly of this description; it would excite"
8241,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"many heart-burnings. Information has been laid before me, Filippo,"
8242,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"that thou art attached to a certain young person, by name Lucrezia,"
8243,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"daughter of Francesco Buti, a citizen of Prato."
8244,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8245,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ I acknowledge my attachment: it continues.
8246,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8247,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ Furthermore, that thou hast offspring by her."
8248,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8249,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Alas! 'tis undeniable.
8250,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8251,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ I will not only legitimatize the said offspring by _motu
8252,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,proprio_ and rescript to consistory and chancery....
8253,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8254,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ Holy Father! Holy Father! For the love of the Virgin, not a"
8255,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,word to consistory or chancery of the two hundred zecchins. As I hope
8256,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"for salvation, I have but forty left, and thirty-nine would not serve"
8257,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,them.
8258,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8259,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Fear nothing. Not only will I perform what I have
8260,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"promised, not only will I give the strictest order that no money be"
8261,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"demanded by any officer of my courts, but, under the seal of Saint"
8262,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"Peter, I will declare thee and Lucrezia Buti man and wife."
8263,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8264,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ Man and wife!
8265,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8266,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Moderate thy transport.
8267,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8268,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ O Holy Father! may I speak?
8269,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8270,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Surely she is not the wife of another?
8271,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8272,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ No, indeed."
8273,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8274,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Nor within the degrees of consanguinity and affinity?
8275,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8276,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ No, no, no. But ... man and wife! Consistory and chancery"
8277,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,are nothing to this fulmination.
8278,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8279,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ How so?
8280,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8281,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ It is man and wife the first fortnight, but wife and man"
8282,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,ever after. The two figures change places: the unit is the decimal and
8283,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,the decimal is the unit.

8285,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ What, then, can I do for thee?"
8286,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8287,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ I love Lucrezia; let me love her; let her love me. I can
8288,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,make her at any time what she is not; I could never make her again
8289,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,what she is.
8290,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8291,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ The only thing I can do then is to promise I will forget
8292,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"that I have heard anything about the matter. But, to forget it, I must"
8293,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,hear it first.
8294,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8295,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Filippo._ In the beautiful little town of Prato, reposing in its"
8296,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"idleness against the hill that protects it from the north, and looking"
8297,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"over fertile meadows, southward to Poggio Cajano, westward to Pistoja,"
8298,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,there is the convent of Santa Margarita. I was invited by the sisters
8299,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"to paint an altar-piece for the chapel. A novice of fifteen, my own"
8300,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"sweet Lucrezia, came one day alone to see me work at my Madonna. Her"
8301,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,blessed countenance had already looked down on every beholder lower by
8302,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,the knees. I myself who made her could almost have worshipped her.
8303,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8304,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ Not while incomplete; no half-virgin will do.
8305,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8306,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ But there knelt Lucrezia! there she knelt! first looking
8307,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"with devotion at the Madonna, then with admiring wonder and grateful"
8308,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,delight at the artist. Could so little a heart be divided? 'Twere a

8310,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,Resolving on a sudden that the object of my love should be the object
8311,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"of adoration to thousands, born and unborn, I swept my brush across"
8312,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"the maternal face, and left a blank in heaven. The little girl"
8313,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,screamed; I pressed her to my bosom.
8314,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8315,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Eugenius._ In the chapel?
8316,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8317,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,_Filippo._ I knew not where I was; I thought I was in Paradise.
8318,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,
8319,FRA FILIPPO LIPPI AND POPE EUGENIUS THE FOURTH,"_Eugenius._ If it was not in the chapel, the sin is venial. But a"

8344,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8345,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ She is dead!

8350,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ Sister! sister! sister! I could not save her.
8351,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8352,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ Certainly it was a sad event; and they who are out of
8353,TASSO AND CORNELIA,spirits may be ready to take it for an evil omen. At this season of

8358,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ The little girl was crushed, they say, by a wheel of the"
8359,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"car laden with grapes, as she held out a handful of vine-leaves to one"

8361,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8362,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ So then the little too can suffer! the ignorant, the"

8369,TASSO AND CORNELIA,The little girl died for her kindness! Natural death!

8383,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ You do think they are sufferings? ay?
8384,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8385,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ Too surely.
8386,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8387,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ No, not too surely: I will not have that answer. They would"
8388,TASSO AND CORNELIA,have been; but Leonora was then living. Unmanly as I am! did I
8389,TASSO AND CORNELIA,complain of them? and while she was left me?
8390,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8391,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ My own Torquato! is there no comfort in a sister's love?
8392,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"Is there no happiness but under the passions? Think, O my brother, how"
8393,TASSO AND CORNELIA,many courts there are in Italy: are the princes more fortunate than

8400,TASSO AND CORNELIA,forefinger with your spittle; stick a broken gold-leaf on the
8401,TASSO AND CORNELIA,sinciput; clip off a beggar's beard to make it tresses; kiss it; fall
8402,TASSO AND CORNELIA,down before it; worship it. Are you not irradiated by the light of its

8404,TASSO AND CORNELIA,that costly carrion? Who thinks about it? [_After a pause._] She is
8405,TASSO AND CORNELIA,dead! She is dead!
8406,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8407,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ We have not heard it here.
8408,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8409,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ At Sorrento you hear nothing but the light surges of the sea,"
8410,TASSO AND CORNELIA,and the sweet sprinkles of the guitar.

8412,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ Suppose the worst to be true.
8413,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8414,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ Always, always."
8415,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8416,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ If she ceases, as then perhaps she must, to love and to"
8417,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"lament you, think gratefully, contentedly, devoutly, that her arms had"
8418,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"clasped your neck before they were crossed upon her bosom, in that"
8419,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"long sleep which you have rendered placid, and from which your"
8420,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"harmonious voice shall once more awaken her. Yes, Torquato! her bosom"
8421,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"had throbbed to yours, often and often, before the organ peal shook"
8422,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"the fringes round the catafalque. Is not this much, from one so high,"
8423,TASSO AND CORNELIA,so beautiful?
8424,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8425,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ Much? yes; for abject me. But I did so love her! so love her!
8426,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8427,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ Ah! let the tears flow: she sends you that balm from
8428,TASSO AND CORNELIA,heaven.
8429,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8430,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ So love her did poor Tasso! Else, O Cornelia, it had indeed"
8431,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"been much. I thought, in the simplicity of my heart, that God was as"
8432,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"great as an emperor, and could bestow and had bestowed on me as much"
8433,TASSO AND CORNELIA,as the German had conferred or could confer on his vassal. No part of
8434,TASSO AND CORNELIA,my insanity was ever held in such ridicule as this. And yet the idea
8435,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"cleaves to me strangely, and is liable to stick to my shroud."
8436,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8437,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ Woe betide the woman who bids you to forget that woman who
8438,TASSO AND CORNELIA,has loved you: she sins against her sex. Leonora was unblameable.
8439,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Never think ill of her for what you have suffered.
8440,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8441,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ Think ill of her? I? I? I? No; those we love, we love for"
8442,TASSO AND CORNELIA,everything; even for the pain they have given us. But she gave me
8443,TASSO AND CORNELIA,none; it was where she was not that pain was.
8444,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8445,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ Surely, if love and sorrow are destined for companionship,"
8446,TASSO AND CORNELIA,there is no reason why the last comer of the two should supersede the
8447,TASSO AND CORNELIA,first.
8448,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8449,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ Argue with me, and you drive me into darkness. I am easily"
8450,TASSO AND CORNELIA,persuaded and led on while no reasons are thrown before me. With these
8451,TASSO AND CORNELIA,you have made my temples throb again. Just heaven! dost thou grant us
8452,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"fairer fields, and wider, for the whirlwind to lay waste? Dost thou"
8453,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"build us up habitations above the street, above the palace, above the"
8454,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"citadel, for the plague to enter and carouse in? Has not my youth paid"
8455,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"its dues, paid its penalties? Cannot our griefs come first, while we"
8456,TASSO AND CORNELIA,have strength to bear them? The fool! the fool! who thinks it a
8457,TASSO AND CORNELIA,misfortune that his love is unrequited. Happier young man! look at the
8458,TASSO AND CORNELIA,violets until thou drop asleep on them. Ah! but thou must awake!
8459,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8460,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ O heavens! what must you have suffered! for a man's heart
8461,TASSO AND CORNELIA,is sensitive in proportion to its greatness.
8462,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8463,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ And a woman's?
8464,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8465,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ Alas! I know not; but I think it can be no other. Comfort
8466,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"thee, comfort thee, dear Torquato!"
8467,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8468,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ Then do not rest thy face upon my arm; it so reminds me of
8469,TASSO AND CORNELIA,her. And thy tears too! they melt me into her grave.
8470,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8471,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ Hear you not her voice as it appeals to you, saying to"
8472,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"you, as the priests around have been saying to _her_, Blessed soul!"
8473,TASSO AND CORNELIA,rest in peace?
8474,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8475,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ I heard it not; and yet I am sure she said it. A thousand
8476,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"times has she repeated it, laying her head on my heart to quiet it,"
8477,TASSO AND CORNELIA,simple girl! She told it to rest in peace ... and she went from me!
8478,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"Insatiable love! ever self-torturer, never self-destroyer! the world,"
8479,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"with all its weight of miseries, cannot crush thee, cannot keep thee"
8480,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"down. Generally men's tears, like the droppings of certain springs,"
8481,TASSO AND CORNELIA,only harden and petrify what they fall on; but mine sank deep into a
8482,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"tender heart, and were its very blood. Never will I believe she has"
8483,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"left me utterly. Oftentimes, and long before her departure, I fancied"
8484,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"we were in heaven together. I fancied it in the fields, in the"
8485,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"gardens, in the palace, in the prison. I fancied it in the broad"
8486,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"daylight, when my eyes were open, when blessed spirits drew around me"
8487,TASSO AND CORNELIA,that golden circle which one only of earth's inhabitants could enter.
8488,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Oftentimes in my sleep also I fancied it; and sometimes in the
8489,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"intermediate state, in that serenity which breathes about the"
8490,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"transported soul, enjoying its pure and perfect rest, a span below the"
8491,TASSO AND CORNELIA,feet of the Immortal.
8492,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8493,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ She has not left you; do not disturb her peace by these
8494,TASSO AND CORNELIA,repinings.
8495,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8496,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ She will bear with them. Thou knowest not what she was,"
8497,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Cornelia; for I wrote to thee about her while she seemed but human. In
8498,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"my hours of sadness, not only her beautiful form, but her very voice"
8499,TASSO AND CORNELIA,bent over me. How girlish in the gracefulness of her lofty form! how
8500,TASSO AND CORNELIA,pliable in her majesty! what composure at my petulance and reproaches!
8501,TASSO AND CORNELIA,what pity in her reproofs! Like the air that angels breathe in the
8502,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"metropolitan temple of the Christian world, her soul at every season"
8503,TASSO AND CORNELIA,preserved one temperature. But it was when she could and did love me!
8504,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Unchanged must ever be the blessed one who has leaned in fond security
8505,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"on the unchangeable. The purifying flame shoots upward, and is the"
8506,TASSO AND CORNELIA,glory that encircles their brows when they meet above.
8507,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8508,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ Indulge in these delightful thoughts, my Torquato! and"
8509,TASSO AND CORNELIA,believe that your love is and ought to be imperishable as your glory.
8510,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Generations of men move forward in endless procession to consecrate
8511,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"and commemorate both. Colour-grinders and gilders, year after year,"
8512,TASSO AND CORNELIA,are bargained with to refresh the crumbling monuments and tarnished
8513,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"decorations of rude, unregarded royalty, and to fasten the nails that"
8514,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"cramp the crown upon its head. Meanwhile, in the laurels of my"
8515,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"Torquato there will always be one leaf above man's reach, above time's"
8516,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"wrath and injury, inscribed with the name of Leonora."
8517,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8518,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ O Jerusalem! I have not then sung in vain the Holy Sepulchre.
8519,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8520,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ After such devotion of your genius, you have undergone too"
8521,TASSO AND CORNELIA,many misfortunes.
8522,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8523,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ Congratulate the man who has had many, and may have more. I"
8524,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"have had, I have, I can have, one only."
8525,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8526,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ Life runs not smoothly at all seasons, even with the"
8527,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"happiest; but after a long course, the rocks subside, the views widen,"
8528,TASSO AND CORNELIA,and it flows on more equably at the end.
8529,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8530,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ Have the stars smooth surfaces? No, no; but how they shine!"
8531,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8532,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ Capable of thoughts so exalted, so far above the earth we"
8533,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"dwell on, why suffer any to depress and anguish you?"
8534,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8535,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ Cornelia, Cornelia! the mind has within its temples and"
8536,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"porticoes and palaces and towers: the mind has under it, ready for the"
8537,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"course, steeds brighter than the sun and stronger than the storm; and"
8538,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"beside them stand winged chariots, more in number than the Psalmist"
8539,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"hath attributed to the Almighty. The mind, I tell thee again, hath its"
8540,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"hundred gates, compared whereto the Theban are but willow wickets; and"
8541,TASSO AND CORNELIA,all those hundred gates can genius throw open. But there are some that
8542,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"groan heavily on their hinges, and the hand of God alone can close"
8543,TASSO AND CORNELIA,them.
8544,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8545,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ Torquato has thrown open those of His holy temple;
8546,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"Torquato hath stood, another angel, at His tomb; and am I the sister"
8547,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"of Torquato? Kiss me, my brother, and let my tears run only from my"
8548,TASSO AND CORNELIA,pride and joy! Princes have bestowed knighthood on the worthy and
8549,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"unworthy; thou hast called forth those princes from their ranks,"
8550,TASSO AND CORNELIA,pushing back the arrogant and presumptuous of them like intrusive
8551,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"varlets, and conferring on the bettermost crowns and robes,"
8552,TASSO AND CORNELIA,imperishable and unfading.
8553,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8554,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ I seem to live back into those days. I feel the helmet on my
8555,TASSO AND CORNELIA,head; I wave the standard over it: brave men smile upon me; beautiful
8556,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"maidens pull them gently back by the scarf, and will not let them"
8557,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"break my slumber, nor undraw the curtain. Corneliolina!..."
8558,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8559,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ Well, my dear brother! why do you stop so suddenly in the"
8560,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"midst of them? They are the pleasantest and best company, and they"
8561,TASSO AND CORNELIA,make you look quite happy and joyous.
8562,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8563,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ Corneliolina, dost thou remember Bergamo? What city was ever"
8564,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"so celebrated for honest and valiant men, in all classes, or for"
8565,TASSO AND CORNELIA,beautiful girls! There is but one class of those: Beauty is above all
8566,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"ranks; the true Madonna, the patroness and bestower of felicity, the"
8567,TASSO AND CORNELIA,queen of heaven.
8568,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8569,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ Hush, Torquato, hush! talk not so."
8570,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8571,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ What rivers, how sunshiny and revelling, are the Brembo and"
8572,TASSO AND CORNELIA,the Serio! What a country the Valtellina! I went back to our father's
8573,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"house, thinking to find thee again, my little sister; thinking to kick"
8574,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"away thy ball of yellow silk as thou wast stooping for it, to make"
8575,TASSO AND CORNELIA,thee run after me and beat me. I woke early in the morning; thou wert
8576,TASSO AND CORNELIA,grown up and gone. Away to Sorrento: I knew the road: a few strides
8577,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"brought me back: here I am. To-morrow, my Cornelia, we will walk"
8578,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"together, as we used to do, into the cool and quiet caves on the"
8579,TASSO AND CORNELIA,shore; and we will catch the little breezes as they come in and go out
8580,TASSO AND CORNELIA,again on the backs of the jocund waves.
8581,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8582,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ We will indeed to-morrow; but before we set out we must
8583,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"take a few hours' rest, that we may enjoy our ramble the better."
8584,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8585,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ Our Sorrentines, I see, are grown rich and avaricious. They"
8586,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"have uprooted the old pomegranate hedges, and have built high walls to"
8587,TASSO AND CORNELIA,prohibit the wayfarer from their vineyards.
8588,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8589,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ I have a basket of grapes for you in the book-room that
8590,TASSO AND CORNELIA,overlooks our garden.
8591,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8592,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ Does the old twisted sage-tree grow still against the window?
8593,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8594,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ It harboured too many insects at last, and there was"
8595,TASSO AND CORNELIA,always a nest of scorpions in the crevice.
8596,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8597,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ Oh! what a prince of a sage-tree! And the well, too, with its"
8598,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"bucket of shining metal, large enough for the largest cocomero to cool"
8599,TASSO AND CORNELIA,in it for dinner.
8600,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8601,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ The well, I assure you, is as cool as ever."
8602,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8603,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ Delicious! delicious! And the stone-work round it, bearing no"
8604,TASSO AND CORNELIA,other marks of waste than my pruning-hook and dagger left behind?
8605,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8606,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ None whatever.
8607,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8608,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ White in that place no longer; there has been time enough for
8609,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"it to become all of one colour: grey, mossy, half-decayed."
8610,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8611,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ No, no; not even the rope has wanted repair."
8612,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8613,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ Who sings yonder?
8614,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8615,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ Enchanter! No sooner did you say the word cocomero than
8616,TASSO AND CORNELIA,here comes a boy carrying one upon his head.
8617,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8618,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ Listen! listen! I have read in some book or other those
8619,TASSO AND CORNELIA,verses long ago. They are not unlike my _Aminta_. The very words!
8620,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8621,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ Purifier of love, and humanizer of ferocity, how many, my"
8622,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"Torquato, will your gentle thoughts make happy!"
8623,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8624,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ At this moment I almost think I am one among them.[10]
8625,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8626,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ Be quite persuaded of it. Come, brother, come with me. You"
8627,TASSO AND CORNELIA,shall bathe your heated brow and weary limbs in the chamber of your
8628,TASSO AND CORNELIA,childhood. It is there we are always the most certain of repose. The
8629,TASSO AND CORNELIA,boy shall sing to you those sweet verses; and we will reward him with
8630,TASSO AND CORNELIA,a slice of his own fruit.
8631,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8632,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ He deserves it; cut it thick.
8633,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8634,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ Come then, my truant! Come along, my sweet smiling"
8635,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Torquato!
8636,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8637,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ The passage is darker than ever. Is this the way to the
8638,TASSO AND CORNELIA,little court? Surely those are not the steps that lead down toward the
8639,TASSO AND CORNELIA,bath? Oh yes! we are right; I smell the lemon-blossoms. Beware of the
8640,TASSO AND CORNELIA,old wilding that bears them; it may catch your veil; it may scratch
8641,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"your fingers! Pray, take care: it has many thorns about it. And now,"
8642,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Leonora! you shall hear my last verses! Lean your ear a little toward
8643,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"me; for I must repeat them softly under this low archway, else others"
8644,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"may hear them too. Ah! you press my hand once more. Drop it, drop it!"
8645,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"or the verses will sink into my breast again, and lie there silent!"
8646,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Good girl!
8647,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8648,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"Many, well I know, there are"
8649,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"Ready in your joys to share,"
8650,TASSO AND CORNELIA,And (I never blame it) you
8651,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Are almost as ready too.
8652,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"But when comes the darker day,"
8653,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"And those friends have dropt away,"
8654,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Which is there among them all
8655,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"You should, if you could, recall?"
8656,TASSO AND CORNELIA,One who wisely loves and well
8657,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Hears and shares the griefs you tell;
8658,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Him you ever call apart
8659,TASSO AND CORNELIA,When the springs o'erflow the heart;
8660,TASSO AND CORNELIA,For you know that he alone
8661,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Wishes they were _but_ his own.
8662,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"Give, while these he may divide,"
8663,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Smiles to all the world beside.
8664,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8665,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ We are now in the full light of the chamber; cannot you
8666,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"remember it, having looked so intently all around?"
8667,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8668,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ O sister! I could have slept another hour. You thought I
8669,TASSO AND CORNELIA,wanted rest: why did you waken me so early? I could have slept another
8670,TASSO AND CORNELIA,hour or longer. What a dream! But I am calm and happy.
8671,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8672,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Cornelia._ May you never more be otherwise! Indeed, he cannot be"
8673,TASSO AND CORNELIA,whose last verses are such as those.
8674,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8675,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ Have you written any since that morning?
8676,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8677,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ What morning?
8678,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8679,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"_Tasso._ When you caught the swallow in my curtains, and trod upon my"
8680,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"knees in catching it, luckily with naked feet. The little girl of"
8681,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"thirteen laughed at the outcry of her brother Torquatino, and sang"
8682,TASSO AND CORNELIA,without a blush her earliest lay.
8683,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8684,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ I do not recollect it.
8685,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8686,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ I do.
8687,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8688,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Rondinello! rondinello!
8689,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"Tu sei nero, ma sei bello."
8690,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Cosa f√† se tu sei nero?
8691,TASSO AND CORNELIA,Rondinello! sei il primiero
8692,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"De' volanti, palpitanti,"
8693,TASSO AND CORNELIA,(E vi sono quanti quanti!)
8694,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"Mai tenuto a questo petto,"
8695,TASSO AND CORNELIA,E perci√≤ sei il mio diletto.[11]
8696,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8697,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Cornelia._ Here is the cocomero; it cannot be more insipid. Try it.
8698,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8699,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Tasso._ Where is the boy who brought it? where is the boy who sang my
8700,TASSO AND CORNELIA,_Aminta_? Serve him first; give him largely. Cut deeper; the knife is
8701,TASSO AND CORNELIA,"too short: deeper; mia brava Corneliolina! quite through all the red,"
8702,TASSO AND CORNELIA,and into the middle of the seeds. Well done!
8703,TASSO AND CORNELIA,
8704,FOOTNOTES:,FOOTNOTES:
8705,FOOTNOTES:,
8706,FOOTNOTES:,[10] The miseries of Tasso arose not only from the imagination and the
8707,FOOTNOTES:,"heart. In the metropolis of the Christian world, with many admirers"
8708,FOOTNOTES:,"and many patrons, bishops, cardinals, princes, he was left destitute,"
8709,FOOTNOTES:,and almost famished. These are his own words: '_Appena_ in questo
8710,FOOTNOTES:,stato ho comprato _due meloni_: e bench√® io sia stato _quasi sempre
8711,FOOTNOTES:,"infermo_, molte volte mi sono contentato del manzo: e la ministra di"
8712,FOOTNOTES:,"latte o di zucca, _quando ho potuto averne_, mi √® stata in vece di"
8713,FOOTNOTES:,delizie.' In another part he says that he was unable to pay the
8714,FOOTNOTES:,carriage of a parcel. No wonder; if he had not wherewithal to buy
8715,FOOTNOTES:,"enough of zucca for a meal. Even had he been in health and appetite,"
8716,FOOTNOTES:,"he might have satisfied his hunger with it for about five farthings,"
8717,FOOTNOTES:,and have left half for supper. And now a word on his insanity. Having
8718,FOOTNOTES:,been so imprudent not only as to make it too evident in his poetry
8719,FOOTNOTES:,"that he was the lover of Leonora, but also to signify (not very"
8720,FOOTNOTES:,"obscurely) that his love was returned, he much perplexed the Duke of"
8721,FOOTNOTES:,"Ferrara, who, with great discretion, suggested to him the necessity of"
8722,FOOTNOTES:,feigning madness. The lady's honour required it from a brother; and a
8723,FOOTNOTES:,"true lover, to convince the world, would embrace the project with"
8724,FOOTNOTES:,alacrity. But there was no reason why the seclusion should be in a
8725,FOOTNOTES:,"dungeon, or why exercise and air should be interdicted. This cruelty,"
8726,FOOTNOTES:,"and perhaps his uncertainty of Leonora's compassion, may well be"
8727,FOOTNOTES:,imagined to have produced at last the malady he had feigned. But did
8728,FOOTNOTES:,Leonora love Tasso as a man would be loved? If we wish to do her
8729,FOOTNOTES:,"honour, let us hope it: for what greater glory can there be, than to"
8730,FOOTNOTES:,"have estimated at the full value so exalted a genius, so affectionate"
8731,FOOTNOTES:,and so generous a heart!
8732,FOOTNOTES:,
8733,FOOTNOTES:,"[11] The author wrote the verses first in English, but he found it"

8753,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8754,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ I am truly sensible of the honour I receive, M. de la"
8755,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Rochefoucault, in a visit from a personage so distinguished by his"
8756,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"birth and by his genius. Pardon my ambition, if I confess to you that"
8757,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"I have long and ardently wished for the good fortune, which I never"
8758,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"could promise myself, of knowing you personally."
8759,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8760,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ My dear M. de la Fontaine!
8761,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8762,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ Not '_de_ la', not '_de_ la'. I am _La_ Fontaine,"
8763,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,purely and simply.
8764,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8765,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ The whole; not derivative. You appear, in the midst"
8766,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"of your purity, to have been educated at court, in the lap of the"
8767,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,ladies. What was the last day (pardon!) I had the misfortune to miss
8768,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,you there?
8769,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8770,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ I never go to court. They say one cannot go without
8771,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"silk stockings; and I have only thread: plenty of them indeed, thank"
8772,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"God! Yet, would you believe it? Nanon, in putting a _solette_ to the"
8773,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"bottom of one, last week, sewed it so carelessly, she made a kind of"
8774,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,cord across: and I verily believe it will lame me for life; for I
8775,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,walked the whole morning upon it.
8776,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8777,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ She ought to be whipped.
8778,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8779,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ I thought so too, and grew the warmer at being unable"
8780,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,to find a wisp of osier or a roll of packthread in the house. Barely
8781,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"had I begun with my garter, when in came the Bishop of Grasse, my old"
8782,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"friend Godeau, and another lord, whose name he mentioned, and they"
8783,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"both interceded for her so long and so touchingly, that at last I was"
8784,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,fain to let her rise up and go. I never saw men look down on the
8785,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,erring and afflicted more compassionately. The bishop was quite
8786,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"concerned for me also. But the other, although he professed to feel"
8787,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"even more, and said that it must surely be the pain of purgatory to"
8788,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"me, took a pinch of snuff, opened his waistcoat, drew down his"
8789,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"ruffles, and seemed rather more indifferent."
8790,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8791,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ Providentially, in such moving scenes, the worst is"
8792,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,soon over. But Godeau's friend was not too sensitive.
8793,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8794,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Sensitive! no more than if he had been educated at the
8795,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,butcher's or the Sorbonne.
8796,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8797,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ I am afraid there are as many hard hearts under satin
8798,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,waistcoats as there are ugly visages under the same material in
8799,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,miniature cases.
8800,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8801,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ My lord, I could show you a miniature case which"
8802,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"contains your humble servant, in which the painter has done what no"
8803,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,tailor in his senses would do; he has given me credit for a coat of
8804,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"violet silk, with silver frogs as large as tortoises. But I am loath"
8805,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,to get up for it while the generous heart of this dog (if I mentioned
8806,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,his name he would jump up) places such confidence on my knee.
8807,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8808,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ Pray do not move on any account; above all, lest you"
8809,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"should disturb that amiable grey cat, fast asleep in his innocence on"
8810,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,your shoulder.
8811,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8812,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ Ah, rogue! art thou there? Why! thou hast not licked my"
8813,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,face this half-hour.
8814,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8815,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ And more, too, I should imagine. I do not judge from"
8816,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"his somnolency, which, if he were President of the Parliament, could"
8817,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"not be graver, but from his natural sagacity. Cats weigh"
8818,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,practicabilities. What sort of tongue has he?
8819,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8820,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ He has the roughest tongue and the tenderest heart of
8821,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"any cat in Paris. If you observe the colour of his coat, it is rather"
8822,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,blue than grey; a certain indication of goodness in these
8823,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,contemplative creatures.
8824,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8825,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ We were talking of his tongue alone; by which cats,"
8826,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"like men, are flatterers."
8827,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8828,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Ah! you gentlemen of the court are much mistaken in
8829,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,thinking that vices have so extensive a range. There are some of our
8830,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"vices, like some of our diseases, from which the quadrupeds are"
8831,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"exempt; and those, both diseases and vices, are the most"
8832,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,discreditable.
8833,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8834,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ I do not bear patiently any evil spoken of the court:
8835,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"for it must be acknowledged, by the most malicious, that the court is"
8836,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,the purifier of the whole nation.
8837,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8838,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ I know little of the court, and less of the whole"
8839,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,nation; but how can this be?
8840,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8841,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ It collects all ramblers and gamblers; all the
8842,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,market-men and market-women who deal in articles which God has thrown
8843,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"into their baskets, without any trouble on their part; all the"
8844,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,seducers and all who wish to be seduced; all the duellists who erase
8845,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"their crimes with their swords, and sweat out their cowardice with"
8846,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,daily practice; all the nobles whose patents of nobility lie in gold
8847,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"snuff-boxes, or have worn Mechlin ruffles, or are deposited within the"
8848,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,archives of knee-deep waistcoats; all stock-jobbers and
8849,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"church-jobbers, the black-legged and the red-legged game, the flower"
8850,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"of the _justaucorps_, the _robe_, and the _soutane_. If these were"
8851,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"spread over the surface of France, instead of close compressure in the"
8852,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"court or cabinet, they would corrupt the whole country in two years."
8853,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"As matters now stand, it will require a quarter of a century to effect"
8854,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,it.
8855,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8856,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Am I not right then in preferring my beasts to yours?
8857,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"But if yours were loose, mine (as you prove to me) would be the last"
8858,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"to suffer by it, poor dear creatures! Speaking of cats, I would have"
8859,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,avoided all personality that might be offensive to them: I would not
8860,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"exactly have said, in so many words, that, by their tongues, they are"
8861,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"flatterers, like men. Language may take a turn advantageously in"
8862,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"favour of our friends. True, we resemble all animals in something. I"
8863,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"am quite ashamed and mortified that your lordship, or anybody, should"
8864,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,have had the start of me in this reflection. When a cat flatters with
8865,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,his tongue he is not insincere: you may safely take it for a real
8866,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"kindness. He is loyal, M. de la Rochefoucault! my word for him, he is"
8867,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"loyal. Observe too, if you please, no cat ever licks you when he wants"
8868,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,anything from you; so that there is nothing of baseness in such an act
8869,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"of adulation, if we must call it so. For my part, I am slow to"
8870,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"designate by so foul a name, that (be it what it may) which is"
8871,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,subsequent to a kindness. Cats ask plainly for what they want.
8872,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8873,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ And, if they cannot get it by protocols they get it"
8874,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,by invasion and assault.
8875,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8876,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ No! no! usually they go elsewhere, and fondle those"
8877,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,from whom they obtain it. In this I see no resemblance to invaders and
8878,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,conquerors. I draw no parallels: I would excite no heart-burnings
8879,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,between us and them. Let all have their due.
8880,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8881,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"I do not like to lift this creature off, for it would waken him, else"
8882,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"I could find out, by some subsequent action, the reason why he has not"
8883,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,been on the alert to lick my cheek for so long a time.
8884,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8885,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Cats are wary and provident. He would not enter into
8886,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"any contest with you, however friendly. He only licks your face, I"
8887,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"presume, while your beard is but a match for his tongue."
8888,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8889,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Ha! you remind me. Indeed I did begin to think my beard
8890,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,was rather of the roughest; for yesterday Madame de Rambouillet sent
8891,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"me a plate of strawberries, the first of the season, and raised (would"
8892,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,you believe it?) under glass. One of these strawberries was dropping
8893,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"from my lips, and I attempted to stop it. When I thought it had fallen"
8894,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"to the ground, 'Look for it, Nanon; pick it up and eat it,' said I."
8895,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8896,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"'Master!' cried the wench, 'your beard has skewered and spitted it.'"
8897,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"'Honest girl,' I answered, 'come, cull it from the bed of its"
8898,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,adoption.'
8899,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8900,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,I had resolved to shave myself this morning: but our wisest and best
8901,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"resolutions too often come to nothing, poor mortals!"
8902,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8903,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ We often do very well everything but the only thing
8904,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,we hope to do best of all; and our projects often drop from us by
8905,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,their weight. A little while ago your friend Moli√®re exhibited a
8906,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,remarkable proof of it.
8907,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8908,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ Ah, poor Moli√®re! the best man in the world; but"
8909,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"flighty, negligent, thoughtless. He throws himself into other men, and"
8910,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"does not remember where. The sight of an eagle, M. de la"
8911,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Rochefoucault, but the memory of a fly."
8912,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8913,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault_. I will give you an example: but perhaps it is already
8914,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,known to you.
8915,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8916,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ Likely enough. We have each so many friends, neither of"
8917,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,us can trip but the other is invited to the laugh. Well; I am sure he
8918,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"has no malice, and I hope I have none: but who can see his own faults?"
8919,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8920,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ He had brought out a new edition of his comedies.
8921,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8922,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ There will be fifty; there will be a hundred: nothing
8923,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"in our language, or in any, is so delightful, so graceful; I will add,"
8924,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,so clear at once and so profound.
8925,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8926,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ You are among the few who, seeing well his other"
8927,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"qualities, see that Moli√®re is also profound. In order to present the"
8928,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"new edition to the dauphin, he had put on a sky-blue velvet coat,"
8929,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,powdered with fleurs-de-lis. He laid the volume on his library table;
8930,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"and, resolving that none of the courtiers should have an opportunity"
8931,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"of ridiculing him for anything like absence of mind, he returned to"
8932,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"his bedroom, which, as may often be the case in the economy of poets,"
8933,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"is also his dressing-room. Here he surveyed himself in his mirror, as"
8934,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,well as the creeks and lagoons in it would permit.
8935,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8936,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ I do assure you, from my own observation, M. de la"
8937,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Rochefoucault, that his mirror is a splendid one. I should take it to"
8938,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"be nearly three feet high, reckoning the frame, with the Cupid above"
8939,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,and the elephant under. I suspected it was the present of some great
8940,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,lady; and indeed I have since heard as much.
8941,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8942,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Perhaps then the whole story may be quite as fabulous
8943,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,as the part of it which I have been relating.
8944,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8945,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ In that case, I may be able to set you right again."
8946,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8947,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ He found his peruke a model of perfection; tight, yet"
8948,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,easy; not an inch more on one side than on the other. The black patch
8949,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,on the forehead....
8950,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8951,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Black patch too! I would have given a fifteen-sous
8952,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,piece to have caught him with that black patch.
8953,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8954,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ He found it lovely, marvellous, irresistible. Those"
8955,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,on each cheek....
8956,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8957,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Do you tell me he had one on each cheek?
8958,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8959,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ Symmetrically. The cravat was of its proper descent,"
8960,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,and with its appropriate charge of the best Strasburg snuff upon it.
8961,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"The waistcoat, for a moment, puzzled and perplexed him. He was not"
8962,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,quite sure whether the right number of buttons were in their holes;
8963,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"nor how many above, nor how many below, it was the fashion of the week"
8964,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,to leave without occupation. Such a piece of ignorance is enough to
8965,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,disgrace any courtier on earth. He was in the act of striking his
8966,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"forehead with desperation; but he thought of the patch, fell on his"
8967,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"knees, and thanked Heaven for the intervention."
8968,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8969,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Just like him! just like him! good soul!
8970,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8971,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ The breeches ... ah! those require attention: all
8972,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"proper: everything in its place. Magnificent. The stockings rolled up,"
8973,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,neither too loosely nor too negligently. A picture! The buckles in the
8974,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,shoes ... all but one ... soon set to rights ... well thought of! And
8975,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"now the sword ... ah, that cursed sword! it will bring at least one"
8976,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,man to the ground if it has its own way much longer ... up with it! up
8977,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,with it higher.... _Allons!_ we are out of danger.
8978,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8979,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Delightful! I have him before my eyes. What simplicity!
8980,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"aye, what simplicity!"
8981,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8982,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Now for hat. Feather in? Five at least. Bravo!
8983,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8984,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"He took up hat and plumage, extended his arm to the full length,"
8985,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"raised it a foot above his head, lowered it thereon, opened his"
8986,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"fingers, and let them fall again at his side."
8987,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8988,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ Something of the comedian in that; aye, M. de la"
8989,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Rochefoucault? But, on the stage or off, all is natural in Moli√®re."
8990,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8991,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ Away he went: he reached the palace, stood before the"
8992,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"dauphin.... O consternation! O despair! 'Morbleu! b√™te que je suis,'"
8993,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"exclaimed the hapless man, 'le livre, o√π donc est-il?' You are"
8994,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"forcibly struck, I perceive, by this adventure of your friend."
8995,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
8996,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Strange coincidence! quite unaccountable! There are
8997,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"agents at work in our dreams, M. de la Rochefoucault, which we shall"
8998,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"never see out of them, on this side the grave. [_To himself._]"
8999,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,Sky-blue? no. Fleurs-de-lis? bah! bah! Patches? I never wore one in my
9000,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,life.
9001,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9002,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ It well becomes your character for generosity, M. La"
9003,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Fontaine, to look grave, and ponder, and ejaculate, on a friend's"
9004,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"untoward accident, instead of laughing, as those who little know you,"
9005,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,might expect. I beg your pardon for relating the occurrence.
9006,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9007,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ Right or wrong, I cannot help laughing any longer."
9008,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Comical, by my faith! above the tiptop of comedy. Excuse my flashes"
9009,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,and dashes and rushes of merriment. Incontrollable! incontrollable!
9010,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,Indeed the laughter is immoderate. And you all the while are sitting
9011,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,as grave as a judge; I mean a criminal one; who has nothing to do but
9012,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,to keep up his popularity by sending his rogues to the gallows. The
9013,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,civil indeed have much weighty matter on their minds: they must
9014,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,displease one party: and sometimes a doubt arises whether the fairer
9015,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,hand or the fuller shall turn the balance.
9016,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9017,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ I congratulate you on the return of your gravity and
9018,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,composure.
9019,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9020,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Seriously now: all my lifetime I have been the
9021,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"plaything of dreams. Sometimes they have taken such possession of me,"
9022,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,that nobody could persuade me afterward they were other than real
9023,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"events. Some are very oppressive, very painful, M. de la"
9024,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Rochefoucault! I have never been able, altogether, to disembarrass my"
9025,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,head of the most wonderful vision that ever took possession of any
9026,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"man's. There are some truly important differences, but in many"
9027,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"respects this laughable adventure of my innocent, honest friend"
9028,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,Moli√®re seemed to have befallen myself. I can only account for it by
9029,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,having heard the tale when I was half asleep.
9030,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9031,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Nothing more probable.
9032,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9033,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ You absolutely have relieved me from an incubus.
9034,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9035,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ I do not yet see how.
9036,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9037,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ No longer ago than when you entered this chamber, I"
9038,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"would have sworn that I myself had gone to the Louvre, that I myself"
9039,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"had been commanded to attend the dauphin, that I myself had come into"
9040,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"his presence, had fallen on my knee, and cried, 'Peste! o√π est donc le"
9041,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"livre?' Ah, M. de la Rochefoucault, permit me to embrace you: this is"
9042,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,really to find a friend at court.
9043,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9044,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ My visit is even more auspicious than I could have
9045,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,ventured to expect: it was chiefly for the purpose of asking your
9046,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,permission to make another at my return to Paris.... I am forced to go
9047,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,into the country on some family affairs: but hearing that you have
9048,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"spoken favourably of my _Maxims_, I presume to express my satisfaction"
9049,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,and delight at your good opinion.
9050,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9051,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ Pray, M. de la Rochefoucault, do me the favour to"
9052,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,continue here a few minutes. I would gladly reason with you on some of
9053,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,your doctrines.
9054,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9055,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ For the pleasure of hearing your sentiments on the
9056,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"topics I have treated, I will, although it is late, steal a few"
9057,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"minutes from the court, of which I must take my leave on parting for"
9058,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,the province.
9059,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9060,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ Are you quite certain that all your _Maxims_ are true,"
9061,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"or, what is of greater consequence, that they are all original? I have"
9062,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"lately read a treatise written by an Englishman, Mr. Hobbes; so loyal"
9063,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"a man that, while others tell you kings are appointed by God, he tells"
9064,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,you God is appointed by kings.
9065,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9066,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Ah! such are precisely the men we want. If he
9067,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"establishes this verity, the rest will follow."
9068,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9069,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ He does not seem to care so much about the rest. In his
9070,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,treatise I find the ground-plan of your chief positions.
9071,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9072,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ I have indeed looked over his publication; and we
9073,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,agree on the natural depravity of man.
9074,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9075,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Reconsider your expression. It appears to me that what
9076,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,is natural is not depraved: that depravity is deflection from nature.
9077,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Let it pass: I cannot, however, concede to you that the generality of"
9078,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"men are bad. Badness is accidental, like disease. We find more"
9079,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"tempers good than bad, where proper care is taken in proper time."
9080,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9081,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Care is not nature.
9082,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9083,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Nature is soon inoperative without it; so soon indeed
9084,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,as to allow no opportunity for experiment or hypothesis. Life itself
9085,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"requires care, and more continually than tempers and morals do. The"
9086,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,strongest body ceases to be a body in a few days without a supply of
9087,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"food. When we speak of men being naturally bad or good, we mean"
9088,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,susceptible and retentive and communicative of them. In this case (and
9089,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,there can be no other true or ostensible one) I believe that the more
9090,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,are good; and nearly in the same proportion as there are animals and
9091,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,plants produced healthy and vigorous than wayward and weakly. Strange
9092,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"is the opinion of Mr. Hobbes, that, when God hath poured so abundantly"
9093,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"His benefits on other creatures, the only one capable of great good"
9094,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,should be uniformly disposed to greater evil.
9095,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9096,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ Yet Holy Writ, to which Hobbes would reluctantly"
9097,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"appeal, countenances the supposition."
9098,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9099,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ The Jews, above all nations, were morose and splenetic."
9100,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,Nothing is holy to me that lessens in my view the beneficence of my
9101,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,Creator. If you could show Him ungentle and unkind in a single
9102,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"instance, you would render myriads of men so, throughout the whole"
9103,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"course of their lives, and those too among the most religious. The"
9104,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,less that people talk about God the better. He has left us a design to
9105,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"fill up: He has placed the canvas, the colours, and the pencils,"
9106,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,within reach; His directing hand is over ours incessantly; it is our
9107,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"business to follow it, and neither to turn round and argue with our"
9108,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Master, nor to kiss and fondle Him. We must mind our lesson, and not"
9109,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"neglect our time: for the room is closed early, and the lights are"
9110,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"suspended in another, where no one works. If every man would do all"
9111,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"the good he might within an hour's walk from his house, he would live"
9112,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,the happier and the longer: for nothing is so conducive to longevity
9113,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"as the union of activity and content. But, like children, we deviate"
9114,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"from the road, however well we know it, and run into mire and puddles"
9115,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,in despite of frown and ferule.
9116,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9117,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ Go on, M. La Fontaine! pray go on. We are walking in"
9118,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"the same labyrinth, always within call, always within sight of each"
9119,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"other. We set out at its two extremities, and shall meet at last."
9120,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9121,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ I doubt it. From deficiency of care proceed many
9122,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"vices, both in men and children, and more still from care taken"
9123,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,improperly. Mr. Hobbes attributes not only the order and peace of
9124,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"society, but equity and moderation and every other virtue, to the"
9125,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"coercion and restriction of the laws. The laws, as now constituted, do"
9126,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,a great deal of good; they also do a great deal of mischief. They
9127,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,transfer more property from the right owner in six months than all the
9128,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,thieves of the kingdom do in twelve. What the thieves take they soon
9129,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,disseminate abroad again; what the laws take they hoard. The thief
9130,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,takes a part of your property: he who prosecutes the thief for you
9131,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,takes another part: he who condemns the thief goes to the tax-gatherer
9132,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,and takes the third. Power has been hitherto occupied in no employment
9133,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,but in keeping down Wisdom. Perhaps the time may come when Wisdom
9134,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,shall exert her energy in repressing the sallies of Power.
9135,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9136,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ I think it more probable that they will agree; that
9137,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"they will call together their servants of all liveries, to collect"
9138,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,what they can lay their hands upon; and that meanwhile they will sit
9139,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"together like good housewives, making nets from our purses to cover"
9140,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"the coop for us. If you would be plump and in feather, pick up your"
9141,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"millet and be quiet in your darkness. Speculate on nothing here below,"
9142,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,and I promise you a nosegay in Paradise.
9143,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9144,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ Believe me, I shall be most happy to receive it there"
9145,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"at your hands, my lord duke."
9146,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9147,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"The greater number of men, I am inclined to think, with all the"
9148,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"defects of education, all the frauds committed on their credulity, all"
9149,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"the advantages taken of their ignorance and supineness, are disposed,"
9150,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"on most occasions, rather to virtue than to vice, rather to the kindly"
9151,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"affections than the unkindly, rather to the social than the selfish."
9152,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9153,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Here we differ: and were my opinion the same as
9154,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"yours, my book would be little read and less commended."
9155,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9156,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Why think so?
9157,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9158,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ For this reason. Every man likes to hear evil of all
9159,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"men: every man is delighted to take the air of the common, though not"
9160,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,a soul will consent to stand within his own allotment. No enclosure
9161,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,act! no finger-posts! You may call every creature under heaven fool
9162,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"and rogue, and your auditor will join with you heartily: hint to him"
9163,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"the slightest of his own defects or foibles, and he draws the rapier."
9164,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"You and he are the judges of the world, but not its denizens."
9165,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9166,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Mr. Hobbes has taken advantage of these weaknesses. In
9167,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,his dissertation he betrays the timidity and malice of his character.
9168,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"It must be granted he reasons well, according to the view he has taken"
9169,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,of things; but he has given no proof whatever that his view is a
9170,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"correct one. I will believe that it is, when I am persuaded that"
9171,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"sickness is the natural state of the body, and health the unnatural."
9172,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"If you call him a sound philosopher, you may call a mummy a sound man."
9173,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Its darkness, its hardness, its forced uprightness, and the place in"
9174,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"which you find it, may commend it to you; give me rather some weakness"
9175,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"and peccability, with vital warmth and human sympathies. A shrewd"
9176,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"reasoner in one thing, a sound philosopher is another. I admire your"
9177,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,power and precision. Monks will admonish us how little the author of
9178,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,the _Maxims_ knows of the world; and heads of colleges will cry out 'a
9179,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"libel on human nature!' but when they hear your titles, and, above"
9180,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"all, your credit at court, they will cast back cowl, and peruke, and"
9181,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,lick your boots. You start with great advantages. Throwing off from a
9182,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"dukedom, you are sure of enjoying, if not the tongue of these"
9183,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"puzzlers, the full cry of the more animating, and will certainly be as"
9184,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,long-lived as the imperfection of our language will allow. I consider
9185,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"your _Maxims_ as a broken ridge of hills, on the shady side of which"
9186,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,you are fondest of taking your exercise: but the same ridge hath also
9187,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,a sunny one. You attribute (let me say it again) all actions to
9188,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"self-interest. Now, a sentiment of interest must be preceded by"
9189,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"calculation, long or brief, right or erroneous. Tell me then in what"
9190,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,region lies the origin of that pleasure which a family in the country
9191,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,feels on the arrival of an unexpected friend. I say a family in the
9192,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"country; because the sweetest souls, like the sweetest flowers, soon"
9193,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"canker in cities, and no purity is rarer there than the purity of"
9194,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,delight. If I may judge from the few examples I have been in a
9195,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"position to see, no earthly one can be greater. There are pleasures"
9196,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"which lie near the surface, and which are blocked up by artificial"
9197,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"ones, or are diverted by some mechanical scheme, or are confined by"
9198,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,some stiff evergreen vista of low advantage. But these pleasures do
9199,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"occasionally burst forth in all their brightness; and, if ever you"
9200,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"shall by chance find one of them, you will sit by it, I hope,"
9201,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"complacently and cheerfully, and turn toward it the kindliest aspect"
9202,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,of your meditations.
9203,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9204,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ Many, indeed most people, will differ from me."
9205,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Nothing is quite the same to the intellect of any two men, much less"
9206,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"of all. When one says to another, 'I am entirely of your opinion,' he"
9207,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"uses in general an easy and indifferent phrase, believing in its"
9208,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"accuracy, without examination, without thought. The nearest"
9209,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"resemblance in opinions, if we could trace every line of it, would be"
9210,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,found greatly more divergent than the nearest in the human form or
9211,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"countenance, and in the same proportion as the varieties of mental"
9212,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,qualities are more numerous and fine than of the bodily. Hence I do
9213,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,not expect nor wish that my opinions should in all cases be similar to
9214,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"those of others: but in many I shall be gratified if, by just degrees"
9215,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"and after a long survey, those of others approximate to mine. Nor does"
9216,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"this my sentiment spring from a love of power, as in many good men"
9217,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"quite unconsciously, when they would make proselytes, since I shall"
9218,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"see few and converse with fewer of them, and profit in no way by their"
9219,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,adherence and favour; but it springs from a natural and a cultivated
9220,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"love of all truths whatever, and from a certainty that these delivered"
9221,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,by me are conducive to the happiness and dignity of man. You shake
9222,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,your head.
9223,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9224,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Make it out.
9225,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9226,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ I have pointed out to him at what passes he hath
9227,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"deviated from his true interest, and where he hath mistaken"
9228,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"selfishness for generosity, coldness for judgment, contraction of"
9229,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"heart for policy, rank for merit, pomp for dignity; of all mistakes,"
9230,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,the commonest and the greatest. I am accused of paradox and
9231,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"distortion. On paradox I shall only say, that every new moral truth"
9232,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,has been called so. Inexperienced and negligent observers see no
9233,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,difference in the operations of ravelling and unravelling: they never
9234,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,come close enough: they despise plain work.
9235,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9236,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ The more we simplify things, the better we descry their"
9237,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,substances and qualities. A good writer will not coil them up and
9238,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"press them into the narrowest possible space, nor macerate them into"
9239,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,such particles that nothing shall be remaining of their natural
9240,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"contexture. You are accused of this too, by such as have forgotten"
9241,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"your title-page, and who look for treatises where maxims only have"
9242,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,been promised. Some of them perhaps are spinning out sermons and
9243,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,dissertations from the poorest paragraph in the volume.
9244,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9245,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Let them copy and write as they please; against or
9246,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"for, modestly or impudently. I have hitherto had no assailant who is"
9247,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,not of too slender a make to be detained an hour in the stocks he had
9248,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"unwarily put his foot into. If you hear of any, do not tell of them."
9249,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"On the subjects of my remarks, had others thought as I do, my labour"
9250,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,would have been spared me. I am ready to point out the road where I
9251,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"know it, to whosoever wants it; but I walk side by side with few or"
9252,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,none.
9253,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9254,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ We usually like those roads which show us the fronts of
9255,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"our friends' houses and the pleasure-grounds about them, and the"
9256,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"smooth garden-walks, and the trim espaliers, and look at them with"
9257,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,more satisfaction than at the docks and nettles that are thrown in
9258,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,heaps behind. The _Offices_ of Cicero are imperfect; yet who would not
9259,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,rather guide his children by them than by the line and compass of
9260,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,harder-handed guides; such as Hobbes for instance?
9261,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9262,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Imperfect as some gentlemen in hoods may call the
9263,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Offices_, no founder of a philosophical or of a religious sect has"
9264,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,been able to add to them anything important.
9265,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9266,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Pity! that Cicero carried with him no better
9267,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"authorities than reason and humanity. He neither could work miracles,"
9268,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,nor damn you for disbelieving them. Had he lived fourscore years
9269,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"later, who knows but he might have been another Simon Peter, and have"
9270,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"talked Hebrew as fluently as Latin, all at once! Who knows but we"
9271,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,might have heard of his patrimony! who knows but our venerable popes
9272,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"might have claimed dominion from him, as descendant from the kings of"
9273,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,Rome!
9274,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9275,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ The hint, some centuries ago, would have made your"
9276,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"fortune, and that saintly cat there would have kittened in a mitre."
9277,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9278,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Alas! the hint could have done nothing: Cicero could
9279,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,not have lived later.
9280,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9281,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ I warrant him. Nothing is easier to correct than
9282,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"chronology. There is not a lady in Paris, nor a jockey in Normandy,"
9283,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,that is not eligible to a professor's chair in it. I have seen a man's
9284,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"ancestor, whom nobody ever saw before, spring back over twenty"
9285,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,generations. Our Vatican Jupiters have as little respect for old
9286,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,Chronos as the Cretan had: they mutilate him when and where they think
9287,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"necessary, limp as he may by the operation."
9288,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9289,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ When I think, as you make me do, how ambitious men are,"
9290,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,even those whose teeth are too loose (one would fancy) for a bite at
9291,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"so hard an apple as the devil of ambition offers them, I am inclined"
9292,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,to believe that we are actuated not so much by selfishness as you
9293,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"represent it, but under another form, the love of power. Not to speak"
9294,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"of territorial dominion or political office, and such other things as"
9295,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"we usually class under its appurtenances, do we not desire an"
9296,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,exclusive control over what is beautiful and lovely? the possession
9297,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"of pleasant fields, of well-situated houses, of cabinets, of images,"
9298,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"of pictures, and indeed of many things pleasant to see but useless to"
9299,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"possess; even of rocks, of streams, and of fountains? These things,"
9300,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"you will tell me, have their utility. True, but not to the wisher, nor"
9301,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,does the idea of it enter his mind. Do not we wish that the object of
9302,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,our love should be devoted to us only; and that our children should
9303,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"love us better than their brothers and sisters, or even than the"
9304,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,mother who bore them? Love would be arrayed in the purple robe of
9305,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"sovereignty, mildly as he may resolve to exercise his power."
9306,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9307,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Many things which appear to be incontrovertible are
9308,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"such for their age only, and must yield to others which, in their age,"
9309,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,are equally so. There are only a few points that are always above the
9310,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"waves. Plain truths, like plain dishes, are commended by everybody,"
9311,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,and everybody leaves them whole. If it were not even more impertinent
9312,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,and presumptuous to praise a great writer in his presence than to
9313,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"censure him in his absence, I would venture to say that your prose,"
9314,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"from the few specimens you have given of it, is equal to your verse."
9315,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Yet, even were I the possessor of such a style as yours, I would never"
9316,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,employ it to support my _Maxims_. You would think a writer very
9317,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,impudent and self-sufficient who should quote his own works: to defend
9318,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,them is doing more. We are the worst auxiliaries in the world to the
9319,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"opinions we have brought into the field. Our business is, to measure"
9320,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"the ground, and to calculate the forces; then let them try their"
9321,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"strength. If the weak assails me, he thinks me weak; if the strong, he"
9322,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,thinks me strong. He is more likely to compute ill his own vigour than
9323,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"mine. At all events, I love inquiry, even when I myself sit down. And"
9324,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,I am not offended in my walks if my visitor asks me whither does that
9325,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,alley lead. It proves that he is ready to go on with me; that he sees
9326,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,some space before him; and that he believes there may be something
9327,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,worth looking after.
9328,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9329,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ You have been standing a long time, my lord duke: I"
9330,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,must entreat you to be seated.
9331,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9332,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ Excuse me, my dear M. la Fontaine; I would much"
9333,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,rather stand.
9334,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9335,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Mercy on us! have you been upon your legs ever since
9336,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,you rose to leave me?
9337,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9338,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ A change of position is agreeable: a friend always
9339,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,permits it.
9340,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9341,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Sad doings! sad oversight! The other two chairs were
9342,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,sent yesterday evening to be scoured and mended. But that dog is the
9343,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"best tempered dog! an angel of a dog, I do assure you; he would have"
9344,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"gone down in a moment, at a word. I am quite ashamed of myself for"
9345,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"such inattention. With your sentiments of friendship for me, why could"
9346,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"you not have taken the liberty to shove him gently off, rather than"
9347,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,give me this uneasiness?
9348,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9349,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ My true and kind friend! we authors are too
9350,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"sedentary; we are heartily glad of standing to converse, whenever we"
9351,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,can do it without any restraint on our acquaintance.
9352,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9353,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ I must reprove that animal when he uncurls his body. He
9354,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"seems to be dreaming of Paradise and houris. Ay, twitch thy ear, my"
9355,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,child! I wish at my heart there were as troublesome a fly about the
9356,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,other: God forgive me! The rogue covers all my clean linen! shirt and
9357,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,cravat! what cares he!
9358,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9359,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Dogs are not very modest.
9360,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9361,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ Never say that, M. de la Rochefoucault! The most modest"
9362,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"people upon earth! Look at a dog's eyes, and he half closes them, or"
9363,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"gently turns them away, with a motion of the lips, which he licks"
9364,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"languidly, and of the tail, which he stirs tremulously, begging your"
9365,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,forbearance. I am neither blind nor indifferent to the defects of
9366,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,these good and generous creatures. They are subject to many such as
9367,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"men are subject to: among the rest, they disturb the neighbourhood in"
9368,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,the discussion of their private causes; they quarrel and fight on
9369,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"small motives, such as a little bad food, or a little vainglory, or"
9370,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,the sex. But it must be something present or near that excites them;
9371,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,and they calculate not the extent of evil they may do or suffer.
9372,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9373,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Certainly not: how should dogs calculate?
9374,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9375,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ I know nothing of the process. I am unable to inform
9376,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"you how they leap over hedges and brooks, with exertion just"
9377,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"sufficient, and no more. In regard to honour and a sense of dignity,"
9378,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"let me tell you, a dog accepts the subsidies of his friends, but never"
9379,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"claims them: a dog would not take the field to obtain power for a son,"
9380,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,but would leave the son to obtain it by his own activity and prowess.
9381,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"He conducts his visitor or inmate out a-hunting, and makes a present"
9382,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,of the game to him as freely as an emperor to an elector. Fond as he
9383,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"is of slumber, which is indeed one of the pleasantest and best things"
9384,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"in the universe, particularly after dinner, he shakes it off as"
9385,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"willingly as he would a gadfly, in order to defend his master from"
9386,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,theft or violence. Let the robber or assailant speak as courteously
9387,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"as he may, he waives your diplomatical terms, gives his reasons in"
9388,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"plain language, and makes war. I could say many other things to his"
9389,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"advantage; but I never was malicious, and would rather let both"
9390,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"parties plead for themselves; give me the dog, however."
9391,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9392,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ Faith! I will give you both, and never boast of my"
9393,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,largess in so doing.
9394,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9395,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ I trust I have removed from you the suspicion of
9396,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"selfishness in my client, and I feel it quite as easy to make a"
9397,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"properer disposal of another ill attribute, namely cruelty, which we"
9398,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"vainly try to shuffle off our own shoulders upon others, by employing"
9399,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"the offensive and most unjust term, brutality. But to convince you of"
9400,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"my impartiality, now I have defended the dog from the first obloquy, I"
9401,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"will defend the man from the last, hoping to make you think better of"
9402,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"each. What you attribute to cruelty, both while we are children and"
9403,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"afterward, may be assigned, for the greater part, to curiosity."
9404,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Cruelty tends to the extinction of life, the dissolution of matter,"
9405,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,the imprisonment and sepulture of truth; and if it were our ruling and
9406,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"chief propensity, the human race would have been extinguished in a few"
9407,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"centuries after its appearance. Curiosity, in its primary sense,"
9408,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,implies care and consideration.
9409,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9410,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Words often deflect from their primary sense. We find
9411,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"the most curious men the most idle and silly, the least observant and"
9412,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,conservative.
9413,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9414,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ So we think; because we see every hour the idly
9415,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"curious, and not the strenuously; we see only the persons of the one"
9416,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"set, and only the works of the other."
9417,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9418,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"More is heard of cruelty than of curiosity, because while curiosity is"
9419,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"silent both in itself and about its object, cruelty on most occasions"
9420,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"is like the wind, boisterous in itself, and exciting a murmur and"
9421,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"bustle in all the things it moves among. Added to which, many of the"
9422,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"higher topics whereto our curiosity would turn, are intercepted from"
9423,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,it by the policy of our guides and rulers; while the principal ones on
9424,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"which cruelty is most active, are pointed to by the sceptre and the"
9425,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"truncheon, and wealth and dignity are the rewards of their attainment."
9426,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,What perversion! He who brings a bullock into a city for its
9427,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"sustenance is called a butcher, and nobody has the civility to take"
9428,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"off the hat to him, although knowing him as perfectly as I know"
9429,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Matthieu le Mince, who served me with those fine kidneys you must have"
9430,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"remarked in passing through the kitchen: on the contrary, he who"
9431,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,reduces the same city to famine is styled M. le G√©n√©ral or M. le
9432,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Mar√©chal, and gentlemen like you, unprejudiced (as one would think)"
9433,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"and upright, make room for him in the antechamber."
9434,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9435,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ He obeys orders without the degrading influence of
9436,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,any passion.
9437,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9438,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ Then he commits a baseness the more, a cruelty the"
9439,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"greater. He goes off at another man's setting, as ingloriously as a"
9440,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"rat-trap: he produces the worst effects of fury, and feels none: a"
9441,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,Cain unirritated by a brother's incense.
9442,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9443,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ I would hide from you this little rapier, which, like"
9444,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"the barber's pole, I have often thought too obtrusive in the streets."
9445,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9446,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Never shall I think my countrymen half civilized while
9447,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,on the dress of a courtier is hung the instrument of a cut-throat. How
9448,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,deplorably feeble must be that honour which requires defending at
9449,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,every hour of the day!
9450,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9451,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ Ingenious as you are, M. La Fontaine, I do not"
9452,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"believe that, on this subject, you could add anything to what you have"
9453,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"spoken already; but really, I do think one of the most instructive"
9454,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,things in the world would be a dissertation on dress by you.
9455,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9456,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Nothing can be devised more commodious than the dress
9457,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,in fashion. Perukes have fallen among us by the peculiar dispensation
9458,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,of Providence. As in all the regions of the globe the indigenous have
9459,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"given way to stronger creatures, so have they (partly at least) on the"
9460,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,human head. At present the wren and the squirrel are dominant there.
9461,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"Whenever I have a mind for a filbert, I have only to shake my foretop."
9462,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,Improvement does not end in that quarter. I might forget to take my
9463,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"pinch of snuff when it would do me good, unless I saw a store of it on"
9464,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"another's cravat. Furthermore, the slit in the coat behind tells in a"
9465,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"moment what it was made for: a thing of which, in regard to ourselves,"
9466,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,the best preachers have to remind us all our lives: then the central
9467,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,part of our habiliment has either its loop-hole or its portcullis in
9468,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"the opposite direction, still more demonstrative. All these are for"
9469,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,very mundane purposes: but Religion and Humanity have whispered some
9470,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"later utilities. We pray the more commodiously, and of course the more"
9471,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"frequently, for rolling up a royal ell of stocking round about our"
9472,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,knees: and our high-heeled shoes must surely have been worn by some
9473,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"angel, to save those insects which the flat-footed would have crushed"
9474,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,to death.
9475,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9476,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Ah! the good dog has awakened: he saw me and my
9477,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"rapier, and ran away. Of what breed is he? for I know nothing of dogs."
9478,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9479,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ And write so well!
9480,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9481,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ Is he a truffler?
9482,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9483,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ No, not he; but quite as innocent."
9484,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9485,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ Something of the shepherd-dog, I suspect."
9486,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9487,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_La Fontaine._ Nor that neither; although he fain would make you
9488,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"believe it. Indeed he is very like one: pointed nose, pointed ears,"
9489,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"apparently stiff, but readily yielding; long hair, particularly about"
9490,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"the neck; noble tail over his back, three curls deep, exceedingly"
9491,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"pleasant to stroke down again; straw-colour all above, white all"
9492,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"below. He might take it ill if you looked for it; but so it is, upon"
9493,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,my word: an ermeline might envy it.
9494,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9495,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,_Rochefoucault._ What are his pursuits?
9496,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9497,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_La Fontaine._ As to pursuit and occupation, he is good for nothing."
9498,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"In fact, I like those dogs best ... and those men too."
9499,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9500,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,"_Rochefoucault._ Send Nanon then for a pair of silk stockings, and"
9501,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,mount my carriage with me: it stops at the Louvre.
9502,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9503,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9504,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9505,LA FONTAINE AND DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULT,
9506,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS
9507,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9508,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9509,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ I am delighted, my Cousin Lucian, to observe how popular"
9510,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,are become your _Dialogues of the Dead_. Nothing can be so gratifying
9511,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and satisfactory to a rightly disposed mind, as the subversion of"
9512,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,imposture by the force of ridicule. It hath scattered the crowd of
9513,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"heathen gods as if a thunderbolt had fallen in the midst of them. Now,"
9514,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"I am confident you never would have assailed the false religion,"
9515,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,unless you were prepared for the reception of the true. For it hath
9516,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"always been an indication of rashness and precipitancy, to throw down"
9517,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,an edifice before you have collected materials for reconstruction.
9518,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9519,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Of all metaphors and remarks, I believe this of yours, my"
9520,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"good cousin Timotheus, is the most trite, and pardon me if I add, the"
9521,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,most untrue. Surely we ought to remove an error the instant we detect
9522,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"it, although it may be out of our competence to state and establish"
9523,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,what is right. A lie should be exposed as soon as born: we are not to
9524,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,wait until a healthier child is begotten. Whatever is evil in any way
9525,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,should be abolished. The husbandman never hesitates to eradicate
9526,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"weeds, or to burn them up, because he may not happen at the time to"
9527,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,carry a sack on his shoulder with wheat or barley in it. Even if no
9528,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"wheat or barley is to be sown in future, the weeding and burning are"
9529,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"in themselves beneficial, and something better will spring up."
9530,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9531,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ That is not so certain.
9532,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9533,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Doubt it as you may, at least you will allow that the"
9534,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,temporary absence of evil is an advantage.
9535,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9536,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ I think, O Lucian, you would reason much better if you"
9537,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,would come over to our belief.
9538,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9539,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I was unaware that belief is an encourager and guide to
9540,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,reason.
9541,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9542,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Depend upon it, there can be no stability of truth, no"
9543,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"elevation of genius, without an unwavering faith in our holy"
9544,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"mysteries. Babes and sucklings who are blest with it, stand higher,"
9545,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"intellectually as well as morally, than stiff unbelievers and proud"
9546,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,sceptics.
9547,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9548,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I do not wonder that so many are firm holders of this novel
9549,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,doctrine. It is pleasant to grow wise and virtuous at so small an
9550,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,expenditure of thought or time. This saying of yours is exactly what I
9551,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,heard spoken with angry gravity not long ago.
9552,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9553,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Angry! no wonder! for it is impossible to keep our
9554,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,patience when truths so incontrovertible are assailed. What was your
9555,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,answer?
9556,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9557,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ My answer was: If you talk in this manner, my honest friend,"
9558,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,you will excite a spirit of ridicule in the gravest and most saturnine
9559,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of men, who never had let a laugh out of their breasts before. Lie to"
9560,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_me_, and welcome; but beware lest your own heart take you to task for"
9561,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"it, reminding you that both anger and falsehood are reprehended by all"
9562,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"religions, yours included."
9563,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9564,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Lucian! Lucian! you have always been called profane.
9565,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9566,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ For what? for having turned into ridicule the gods whom you
9567,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"have turned out of house and home, and are reducing to dust?"
9568,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9569,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Well; but you are equally ready to turn into ridicule the
9570,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,true and holy.
9571,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9572,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ In other words, to turn myself into a fool. He who brings"
9573,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"ridicule to bear against Truth, finds in his hand a blade without a"
9574,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,hilt. The most sparkling and pointed flame of wit flickers and
9575,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,expires against the incombustible walls of her sanctuary.
9576,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9577,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Fine talking! Do you know, you have really been called an"
9578,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,atheist?
9579,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9580,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Yes, yes; I know it well. But, in fact, I believe there are"
9581,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,almost as few atheists in the world as there are Christians.
9582,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9583,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ How! as few? Most of Europe, most of Asia, most of"
9584,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Africa, is Christian."
9585,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9586,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Show me five men in each who obey the commands of Christ,"
9587,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and I will show you five hundred in this very city who observe the
9588,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,dictates of Pythagoras. Every Pythagorean obeys his defunct
9589,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,philosopher; and almost every Christian disobeys his living God. Where
9590,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,is there one who practises the most important and the easiest of His
9591,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"commands, to abstain from strife? Men easily and perpetually find"
9592,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,something new to quarrel about; but the objects of affection are
9593,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"limited in number, and grow up scantily and slowly. Even a small house"
9594,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"is often too spacious for them, and there is a vacant seat at the"
9595,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"table. Religious men themselves, when the Deity has bestowed on them"
9596,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"everything they prayed for, discover, as a peculiar gift of"
9597,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Providence, some fault in the actions or opinions of a neighbour, and"
9598,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"run it down, crying and shouting after it, with more alacrity and more"
9599,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,clamour than boys would a leveret or a squirrel in the playground. Are
9600,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"our years and our intellects, and the word of God itself, given us for"
9601,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"this, O Timotheus?"
9602,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9603,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ A certain latitude, a liberal construction...."
9604,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9605,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Ay, ay! These 'liberal constructions' let loose all the"
9606,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"worst passions into those 'certain latitudes'. The priests themselves,"
9607,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"who ought to be the poorest, are the richest; who ought to be the most"
9608,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"obedient, are the most refractory and rebellious. All trouble and all"
9609,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"piety are vicarious. They send missionaries, at the cost of others,"
9610,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"into foreign lands, to teach observances which they supersede at home."
9611,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"I have ridiculed the puppets of all features, all colours, all sizes,"
9612,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,by which an impudent and audacious set of impostors have been gaining
9613,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,an easy livelihood these two thousand years.
9614,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9615,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Gently! gently! Ours have not been at it yet two hundred.
9616,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,We abolish all idolatry. We know that Jupiter was not the father of
9617,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,gods and men: we know that Mars was not the Lord of Hosts: we know who
9618,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,is: we are quite at ease upon that question.
9619,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9620,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Are you so fanatical, my good Timotheus, as to imagine that"
9621,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the Creator of the world cares a fig by what appellation you adore
9622,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Him? whether you call Him on one occasion Jupiter, on another Apollo?"
9623,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"I will not add Mars or Lord of Hosts; for, wanting as I may be in"
9624,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"piety, I am not, and never was, so impious as to call the Maker the"
9625,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Destroyer; to call Him Lord of Hosts who, according to your holiest of"
9626,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"books, declared so lately and so plainly that He permits no hosts at"
9627,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,all; much less will He take the command of one against another. Would
9628,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"any man in his senses go down into the cellar, and seize first an"
9629,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"amphora from the right, and then an amphora from the left, for the"
9630,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"pleasure of breaking them in pieces, and of letting out the wine he"
9631,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,had taken the trouble to put in? We are not contented with attributing
9632,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to the gods our own infirmities; we make them even more wayward, even"
9633,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"more passionate, even more exigent and more malignant: and then some"
9634,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of us try to coax and cajole them, and others run away from them"
9635,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,outright.
9636,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9637,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ No wonder: but only in regard to yours: and even those
9638,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,are types.
9639,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9640,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ There are honest men who occupy their lives in discovering
9641,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,types for all things.
9642,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9643,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Truly and rationally thou speakest now. Honest men and
9644,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"wise men above their fellows are they, and the greatest of all"
9645,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"discoverers. There are many types above thy reach, O Lucian!"
9646,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9647,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ And one which my mind, and perhaps yours also, can"
9648,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"comprehend. There is in Italy, I hear, on the border of a quiet and"
9649,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"beautiful lake, a temple dedicated to Diana; the priests of which"
9650,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,temple have murdered each his predecessor for unrecorded ages.
9651,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9652,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ What of that? They were idolaters.
9653,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9654,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ They made the type, however: take it home with you, and hang"
9655,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,it up in your temple.
9656,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9657,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Why! you seem to have forgotten on a sudden that I am a
9658,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Christian: you are talking of the heathens.
9659,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9660,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ True! true! I am near upon eighty years of age, and to my"
9661,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,poor eyesight one thing looks very like another.
9662,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9663,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ You are too indifferent.
9664,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9665,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ No indeed. I love those best who quarrel least, and who"
9666,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,bring into public use the most civility and good humour.
9667,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9668,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Our holy religion inculcates this duty especially.
9669,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9670,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Such being the case, a pleasant story will not be thrown"
9671,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"away upon you. Xenophanes, my townsman of Samosata, was resolved to"
9672,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"buy a new horse: he had tried him, and liked him well enough. I asked"
9673,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"him why he wished to dispose of his old one, knowing how sure-footed"
9674,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"he was, how easy in his paces, and how quiet in his pasture. 'Very"
9675,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"true, O Lucian,' said he; 'the horse is a clever horse; noble eye,"
9676,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"beautiful figure, stately step; rather too fond of neighing and of"
9677,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,shuffling a little in the vicinity of a mare; but tractable and good
9678,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"tempered.' 'I would not have parted with him then,' said I. 'The fact"
9679,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"is,' replied he, 'my grandfather, whom I am about to visit, likes no"
9680,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,horses but what are _Saturnized_. To-morrow I begin my journey: come
9681,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and see me set out.' I went at the hour appointed. The new purchase
9682,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"looked quiet and demure; but _he_ also pricked up his ears, and gave"
9683,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"sundry other tokens of equinity, when the more interesting part of his"
9684,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"fellow-creatures came near him. As the morning oats began to operate,"
9685,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"he grew more and more unruly, and snapped at one friend of Xenophanes,"
9686,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and sidled against another, and gave a kick at a third. 'All in play!"
9687,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,all in play!' said Xenophanes; 'his nature is more of a lamb's than a
9688,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"horse's.' However, these mute salutations being over, away went"
9689,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Xenophanes. In the evening, when my lamp had just been replenished for"
9690,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the commencement of my studies, my friend came in striding as if he"
9691,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"were still across the saddle. 'I am apprehensive, O Xenophanes,' said"
9692,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"I, 'your new acquaintance has disappointed you.' 'Not in the least,'"
9693,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"answered he. 'I do assure you, O Lucian! he is the very horse I was"
9694,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"looking out for.' On my requesting him to be seated, he no more"
9695,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,thought of doing so than if it had been in the presence of the Persian
9696,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"king. I then handed my lamp to him, telling him (as was true) it"
9697,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"contained all the oil I had in the house, and protesting I should be"
9698,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,happier to finish my Dialogue in the morning. He took the lamp into my
9699,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"bedroom, and appeared to be much refreshed on his return."
9700,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Nevertheless, he treated his chair with great delicacy and"
9701,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"circumspection, and evidently was afraid of breaking it by too sudden"
9702,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,a descent. I did not revert to the horse: but he went on of his own
9703,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"accord. 'I declare to you, O Lucian! it is impossible for me to be"
9704,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,mistaken in a palfrey. My new one is the only one in Samosata that
9705,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,could carry me at one stretch to my grandfather's.' 'But _has_ he?'
9706,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"said I, timidly. 'No; he has not yet,' answered my friend. 'To-morrow,"
9707,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"then, I am afraid, we really must lose you.' 'No,' said he; 'the horse"
9708,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,does trot hard: but he is the better for that: I shall soon get used
9709,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to him.' In fine, my worthy friend deferred his visit to his"
9710,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,grandfather: his rides were neither long nor frequent: he was ashamed
9711,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to part with his purchase, boasted of him everywhere, and, humane as"
9712,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"he is by nature, could almost have broken on the cross the quiet"
9713,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,contented owner of old Bucephalus.
9714,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9715,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Am I to understand by this, O Cousin Lucian, that I ought"
9716,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,to be contented with the impurities of paganism?
9717,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9718,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Unless you are very unreasonable. A moderate man finds
9719,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,plenty in it.
9720,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9721,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ We abominate the Deities who patronize them, and we hurl"
9722,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,down the images of the monsters.
9723,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9724,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Sweet cousin! be tenderer to my feelings. In such a tempest
9725,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"as this, my spark of piety may be blown out. Hold your hand cautiously"
9726,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"before it, until I can find my way. Believe me, no Deities (out of"
9727,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,their own houses) patronize immorality; none patronize unruly
9728,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"passions, least of all the fierce and ferocious. In my opinion, you"
9729,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,are wrong in throwing down the images of those among them who look on
9730,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,you benignly: the others I give up to your discretion. But I think it
9731,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,impossible to stand habitually in the presence of a sweet and open
9732,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"countenance, graven or depicted, without in some degree partaking of"
9733,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the character it expresses. Never tell any man that he can derive no
9734,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"good, in his devotions, from this or from that: abolish neither hope"
9735,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,nor gratitude.
9736,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9737,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ God is offended at vain efforts to represent Him.
9738,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9739,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ No such thing, my dear Timotheus. If you knew Him at all,"
9740,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"you would not talk of Him so irreverently. He is pleased, I am"
9741,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"convinced, at every effort to resemble Him, at every wish to remind"
9742,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,both ourselves and others of His benefits. You cannot think so often
9743,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,of Him without an effigy.
9744,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9745,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ What likeness is there in the perishable to the
9746,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Unperishable?
9747,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9748,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I see no reason why there may not be a similitude. All that
9749,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the senses can comprehend may be represented by any material; clay or
9750,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"fig-tree, bronze or ivory, porphyry or gold. Indeed I have a faint"
9751,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"remembrance that, according to your sacred volumes, man was made by"
9752,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"God after His own image. If so, man's intellectual powers are worthily"
9753,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"exercised in attempting to collect all that is beautiful, serene, and"
9754,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"dignified, and to bring Him back to earth again by showing Him the"
9755,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"noblest of His gifts, the work most like His own. Surely He cannot"
9756,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"hate or abandon those who thus cherish His memory, and thus implore"
9757,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,His regard. Perishable and imperfect is everything human: but in these
9758,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,very qualities I find the best reason for striving to attain what is
9759,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,least so. Would not any father be gratified by seeing his child
9760,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,attempt to delineate his features? And would not the gratification be
9761,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,rather increased than diminished by his incapacity? How long shall the
9762,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,narrow mind of man stand between goodness and omnipotence? Perhaps the
9763,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"effigy of your ancestor Isknos is unlike him; whether it is or no, you"
9764,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"cannot tell; but you keep it in your hall, and would be angry if"
9765,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,anybody broke it to pieces or defaced it. Be quite sure there are many
9766,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"who think as much of their gods as you think of your ancestor Isknos,"
9767,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and who see in their images as good a likeness. Let men have their own
9768,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"way, especially their way to the temples. It is easier to drive them"
9769,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,out of one road than into another. Our judicious and good-humoured
9770,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Trajan has found it necessary on many occasions to chastise the
9771,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"law-breakers of your sect, indifferent as he is what gods are"
9772,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"worshipped, so long as their followers are orderly and decorous. The"
9773,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"fiercest of the Dacians never knocked off Jupiter's beard, or broke an"
9774,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,arm off Venus; and the emperor will hardly tolerate in those who have
9775,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,received a liberal education what he would punish in barbarians. Do
9776,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"not wear out his patience: try rather to imitate his equity, his"
9777,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"equanimity, and forbearance."
9778,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9779,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ I have been listening to you with much attention, O"
9780,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Lucian! for I seldom have heard you speak with such gravity. And yet,"
9781,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,O Cousin Lucian! I really do find in you a sad deficiency of that
9782,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,wisdom which alone is of any value. You talk of Trajan! what is
9783,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Trajan?
9784,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9785,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ A beneficent citizen, an impartial judge, a sagacious ruler;"
9786,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the comrade of every brave soldier, the friend and associate of every"
9787,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"man eminent in genius, throughout his empire, the empire of the world."
9788,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"All arts, all sciences, all philosophies, all religions, are protected"
9789,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"by him. Wherefore his name will flourish, when the proudest of these"
9790,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,have perished in the land of Egypt. Philosophies and religions will
9791,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"strive, struggle, and suffocate one another. Priesthoods, I know not"
9792,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"how many, are quarrelling and scuffling in the street at this instant,"
9793,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,all calling on Trajan to come and knock an antagonist on the head; and
9794,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the most peaceful of them, as it wishes to be thought, proclaiming him"
9795,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,an infidel for turning a deaf ear to its imprecations. Mankind was
9796,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,never so happy as under his guidance; and he has nothing now to do but
9797,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to put down the battles of the gods. If they must fight it out, he"
9798,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,will insist on our neutrality.
9799,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9800,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ He has no authority and no influence over us in matters
9801,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of faith. A wise and upright man, whose serious thoughts lead him"
9802,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"forward to religion, will never be turned aside from it by any worldly"
9803,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,consideration or any human force.
9804,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9805,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ True: but mankind is composed not entirely of the upright
9806,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and the wise. I suspect that we may find some, here and there, who are"
9807,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,rather too fond of novelties in the furniture of temples; and I have
9808,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"observed that new sects are apt to warp, crack, and split, under the"
9809,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,heat they generate. Our homely old religion has run into fewer
9810,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"quarrels, ever since the Centaurs and Lapiths (whose controversy was"
9811,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"on a subject quite comprehensible), than yours has engendered in"
9812,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,twenty years.
9813,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9814,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ We shall obviate that inconvenience by electing a supreme
9815,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Pontiff to decide all differences. It has been seriously thought about
9816,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,long ago: and latterly we have been making out an ideal series down to
9817,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the present day, in order that our successors in the ministry may have"
9818,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,stepping-stones up to the fountain-head. At first the disseminators of
9819,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,our doctrines were equal in their commission; we do not approve of
9820,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"this any longer, for reasons of our own."
9821,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9822,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ You may shut, one after another, all our other temples, but,"
9823,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"I plainly see, you will never shut the temple of Janus. The Roman"
9824,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Empire will never lose its pugnacious character while your sect
9825,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"exists. The only danger is, lest the fever rage internally and consume"
9826,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the vitals. If you sincerely wish your religion to be long-lived,"
9827,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"maintain in it the spirit of its constitution, and keep it patient,"
9828,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"humble, abstemious, domestic, and zealous only in the services of"
9829,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,humanity. Whenever the higher of your priesthood shall attain the
9830,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"riches they are aiming at, the people will envy their possessions and"
9831,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"revolt from their impostures. Do not let them seize upon the palace,"
9832,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and shove their God again into the manger.
9833,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9834,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Lucian! Lucian! I call this impiety.
9835,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9836,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ So do I, and shudder at its consequences. Caverns which at"
9837,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"first look inviting, the roof at the aperture green with overhanging"
9838,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"ferns and clinging mosses, then glittering with native gems and with"
9839,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"water as sparkling and pellucid, freshening the air all around; these"
9840,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"caverns grow darker and closer, until you find yourself among animals"
9841,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"that shun the daylight, adhering to the walls, hissing along the"
9842,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"bottom, flapping, screeching, gaping, glaring, making you shrink at"
9843,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the sounds, and sicken at the smells, and afraid to advance or"
9844,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,retreat.
9845,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9846,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ To what can this refer? Our caverns open on verdure, and"
9847,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,terminate in veins of gold.
9848,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9849,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Veins of gold, my good Timotheus, such as your excavations"
9850,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"have opened and are opening, in the spirit of avarice and ambition,"
9851,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"will be washed (or as you would say, _purified_) in streams of blood."
9852,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Arrogance, intolerance, resistance to authority and contempt of law,"
9853,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,distinguish your aspiring sectarians from the other subjects of the
9854,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,empire.
9855,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9856,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Blindness hath often a calm and composed countenance;
9857,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"but, my Cousin Lucian! it usually hath also the advantage of a"
9858,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"cautious and a measured step. It hath pleased God to blind you, like"
9859,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,all the other adversaries of our faith; but He has given you no staff
9860,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,to lean upon. You object against us the very vices from which we are
9861,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,peculiarly exempt.
9862,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9863,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Then it is all a story, a fable, a fabrication, about one of"
9864,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,your earlier leaders cutting off with his sword a servant's ear? If
9865,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the accusation is true, the offence is heavy. For not only was the"
9866,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"wounded man innocent of any provocation, but he is represented as"
9867,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"being in the service of the high priest at Jerusalem. Moreover, from"
9868,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the direction and violence of the blow, it is evident that his life"
9869,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"was aimed at. According to law, you know, my dear cousin, all the"
9870,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"party might have been condemned to death, as accessories to an attempt"
9871,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,at murder. I am unwilling to think so unfavourably of your sect; nor
9872,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"indeed do I see the possibility that, in such an outrage, the"
9873,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,principal could be pardoned. For any man but a soldier to go about
9874,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"armed is against the Roman law, which, on that head, as on many"
9875,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"others, is borrowed from the Athenian; and it is incredible that in"
9876,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,any civilized country so barbarous a practice can be tolerated.
9877,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Travellers do indeed relate that, in certain parts of India, there are"
9878,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,princes at whose courts even civilians are armed. But _traveller_ has
9879,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"occasionally the same signification as _liar_, and _India_ as _fable_."
9880,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"However, if the practice really does exist in that remote and rarely"
9881,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"visited country, it must be in some region of it very far beyond the"
9882,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Indus or the Ganges: for the nations situated between those rivers
9883,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"are, and were in the reign of Alexander, and some thousand years"
9884,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"before his birth, as civilized as the Europeans; nay, incomparably"
9885,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"more courteous, more industrious, and more pacific; the three grand"
9886,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,criterions.
9887,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9888,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,But answer my question: is there any foundation for so mischievous a
9889,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,report?
9890,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9891,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ There was indeed, so to say, an ear, or something of the"
9892,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"kind, abscinded; probably by mistake. But high priests' servants are"
9893,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"propense to follow the swaggering gait of their masters, and to carry"
9894,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"things with a high hand, in such wise as to excite the choler of the"
9895,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,most quiet. If you knew the character of the eminently holy man who
9896,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"punished the atrocious insolence of that bloody-minded wretch, you"
9897,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,would be sparing of your animadversions. We take him for our model.
9898,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9899,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I see you do.
9900,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9901,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ We proclaim him Prince of the Apostles.
9902,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9903,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I am the last in the world to question his princely
9904,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"qualifications; but, if I might advise you, it should be to follow in"
9905,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,preference Him whom you acknowledge to be an unerring guide; who
9906,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"delivered to you His ordinances with His own hand, equitable, plain,"
9907,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"explicit, compendious, and complete; who committed no violence, who"
9908,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"countenanced no injustice, whose compassion was without weakness,"
9909,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"whose love was without frailty, whose life was led in humility, in"
9910,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"purity, in beneficence, and, at the end, laid down in obedience to His"
9911,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Father's will.
9912,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9913,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Ah, Lucian! what strangely imperfect notions! all that is"
9914,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,little.
9915,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9916,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Enough to follow.
9917,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9918,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Not enough to compel others. I did indeed hope, O Lucian!"
9919,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,that you would again come forward with the irresistible arrows of your
9920,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"wit, and unite with us against our adversaries. By what you have just"
9921,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"spoken, I doubt no longer that you approve of the doctrines inculcated"
9922,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,by the blessed Founder of our religion.
9923,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9924,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ To the best of my understanding.
9925,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9926,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ So ardent is my desire for the salvation of your precious
9927,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"soul, O my cousin! that I would devote many hours of every day to"
9928,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,disputation with you on the principal points of our Christian
9929,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,controversy.
9930,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9931,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Many thanks, my kind Timotheus! But I think the blessed"
9932,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Founder of your religion very strictly forbade that there should be
9933,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_any_ points of controversy. Not only has He prohibited them on the
9934,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"doctrines He delivered, but on everything else. Some of the most"
9935,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"obstinate might never have doubted of His Divinity, if the conduct of"
9936,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,His followers had not repelled them from the belief of it. How can
9937,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,they imagine you sincere when they see you disobedient? It is in vain
9938,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"for you to protest that you worship the God of Peace, when you are"
9939,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,found daily in the courts and market-places with clenched fists and
9940,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,bloody noses. I acknowledge the full value of your offer; but really I
9941,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,am as anxious for the salvation of your precious time as you appear to
9942,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"be for the salvation of my precious soul, particularly since I am"
9943,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"come to the conclusion that souls cannot be lost, and that time can."
9944,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9945,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ We mean by _salvation_ exemption from eternal torments.
9946,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9947,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Among all my old gods and their children, morose as some of"
9948,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the senior are, and mischievous as are some of the junior, I have"
9949,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,never represented the worst of them as capable of inflicting such
9950,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,atrocity. Passionate and capricious and unjust are several of them;
9951,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"but a skin stripped off the shoulder, and a liver tossed to a vulture,"
9952,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,are among the worst of their inflictions.
9953,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9954,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ This is scoffing.
9955,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9956,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Nobody but an honest man has a right to scoff at anything.
9957,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9958,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ And yet people of a very different cast are usually those
9959,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,who scoff the most.
9960,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9961,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ We are apt to push forward at that which we are without: the
9962,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"low-born at titles and distinctions, the silly at wit, the knave at"
9963,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the semblance of probity. But I was about to remark, that an honest"
9964,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,man may fairly scoff at all philosophies and religions which are
9965,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"proud, ambitious, intemperate, and contradictory. The thing most"
9966,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,adverse to the spirit and essence of them all is falsehood. It is the
9967,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,business of the philosophical to seek truth: it is the office of the
9968,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,religious to worship her; under what name is unimportant. The
9969,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,falsehood that the tongue commits is slight in comparison with what is
9970,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"conceived by the heart, and executed by the whole man, throughout"
9971,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"life. If, professing love and charity to the human race at large, I"
9972,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"quarrel day after day with my next neighbour; if, professing that the"
9973,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"rich can never see God, I spend in the luxuries of my household a"
9974,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"talent monthly; if, professing to place so much confidence in His"
9975,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"word, that, in regard to wordly weal, I need take no care for"
9976,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to-morrow, I accumulate stores even beyond what would be necessary,"
9977,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"though I quite distrusted both His providence and His veracity; if,"
9978,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"professing that 'he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord', I"
9979,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"question the Lord's security, and haggle with Him about the amount of"
9980,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the loan; if, professing that I am their steward, I keep ninety-nine"
9981,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"parts in the hundred as the emolument of my stewardship; how, when God"
9982,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"hates liars and punishes defrauders, shall I, and other such thieves"
9983,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and hypocrites, fare hereafter?"
9984,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9985,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Let us hope there are few of them.
9986,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9987,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ We cannot hope against what is: we may, however, hope that"
9988,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,in future these will be fewer; but never while the overseers of a
9989,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"priesthood look for offices out of it, taking the lead in politics, in"
9990,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"debate, and strife. Such men bring to ruin all religion, but their own"
9991,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"first, and raise unbelievers not only in Divine Providence, but in"
9992,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,human faith.
9993,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9994,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ If they leave the altar for the market-place, the"
9995,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"sanctuary for the senate-house, and agitate party questions instead of"
9996,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Christian verities, everlasting punishments await them."
9997,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
9998,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Everlasting?
9999,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10000,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Certainly: at the very least. I rank it next to heresy in
10001,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the catalogue of sins; and the Church supports my opinion.
10002,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10003,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I have no measure for ascertaining the distance between the
10004,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,opinions and practices of men; I only know that they stand widely
10005,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,apart in all countries on the most important occasions; but this
10006,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"newly-hatched word _heresy_, alighting on my ear, makes me rub it. A"
10007,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"beneficent God descends on earth in the human form, to redeem us from"
10008,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the slavery of sin, from the penalty of our passions: can you imagine"
10009,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"He will punish an error in opinion, or even an obstinacy in unbelief,"
10010,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,with everlasting torments? Supposing it highly criminal to refuse to
10011,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"weigh a string of arguments, or to cross-question a herd of witnesses,"
10012,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,on a subject which no experience has warranted and no sagacity can
10013,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,comprehend; supposing it highly criminal to be contented with the
10014,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"religion which our parents taught us, which they bequeathed to us as"
10015,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the most precious of possessions, and which it would have broken their"
10016,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,hearts if they had foreseen we should cast aside; yet are eternal
10017,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,pains the just retribution of what at worst is but indifference and
10018,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,supineness?
10019,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10020,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Our religion has clearly this advantage over yours: it
10021,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,teaches us to regulate our passions.
10022,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10023,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Rather say it _tells_ us. I believe all religions do the
10024,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,same; some indeed more emphatically and primarily than others; but
10025,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_that_ indeed would be incontestably of Divine origin, and"
10026,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"acknowledged at once by the most sceptical, which should thoroughly"
10027,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"teach it. Now, my friend Timotheus, I think you are about seventy-five"
10028,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,years of age.
10029,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10030,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Nigh upon it.
10031,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10032,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Seventy-five years, according to my calculation, are"
10033,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,equivalent to seventy-five gods and goddesses in regulating our
10034,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"passions for us, if we speak of the amatory, which are always thought"
10035,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,in every stage of life the least to be pardoned.
10036,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10037,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Execrable!
10038,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10039,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I am afraid the sourest hang longest on the tree. Mimnermus
10040,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,says:
10041,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10042,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,In early youth we often sigh
10043,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Because our pulses beat so high;
10044,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"All this we conquer, and at last"
10045,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,We sigh that we are grown so chaste.
10046,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10047,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Swine!
10048,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10049,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ No animal sighs oftener or louder. But, my dear cousin, the"
10050,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,quiet swine is less troublesome and less odious than the grumbling and
10051,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"growling and fierce hyena, which will not let the dead rest in their"
10052,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"graves. We may be merry with the follies and even the vices of men,"
10053,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,without doing or wishing them harm; punishment should come from the
10054,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"magistrate, not from us. If we are to give pain to any one because he"
10055,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"thinks differently from us, we ought to begin by inflicting a few"
10056,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,smart stripes on ourselves; for both upon light and upon grave
10057,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"occasions, if we have thought much and often, our opinions must have"
10058,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,varied. We are always fond of seizing and managing what appertains to
10059,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,others. In the savage state all belongs to all. Our neighbours the
10060,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Arabs, who stand between barbarism and civilization, waylay"
10061,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"travellers, and plunder their equipage and their gold. The wilier"
10062,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"marauders in Alexandria start up from under the shadow of temples,"
10063,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"force us to change our habiliments for theirs, and strangle us with"
10064,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,fingers dipped in holy water if we say they sit uneasily.
10065,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10066,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ This is not the right view of things.
10067,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10068,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ That is never the right view which lets in too much light.
10069,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,About two centuries have elapsed since your religion was founded. Show
10070,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,me the pride it has humbled; show me the cruelty it has mitigated;
10071,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,show me the lust it has extinguished or repressed. I have now been
10072,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"living ten years in Alexandria; and you never will accuse me, I think,"
10073,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of any undue partiality for the system in which I was educated; yet,"
10074,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"from all my observation, I find no priest or elder, in your community,"
10075,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"wise, tranquil, firm, and sedate as Epicurus, and Carneades, and Zeno,"
10076,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and Epictetus; or indeed in the same degree as some who were often
10077,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"called forth into political and military life; Epaminondas, for"
10078,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"instance, and Phocion."
10079,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10080,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ I pity them from my soul: they were ignorant of the
10081,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"truth: they are lost, my cousin! take my word for it, they are lost"
10082,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,men.
10083,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10084,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Unhappily, they are. I wish we had them back again; or"
10085,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"that, since we have lost them, we could at least find among us the"
10086,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,virtues they left for our example.
10087,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10088,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Alas, my poor cousin! you too are blind; you do not"
10089,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"understand the plainest words, nor comprehend those verities which are"
10090,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the most evident and palpable. Virtues! if the poor wretches had any,"
10091,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,they were false ones.
10092,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10093,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Scarcely ever has there been a politician, in any free"
10094,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"state, without much falsehood and duplicity. I have named the most"
10095,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,illustrious exceptions. Slender and irregular lines of a darker colour
10096,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"run along the bright blade that decides the fate of nations, and may"
10097,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,indeed be necessary to the perfection of its temper. The great warrior
10098,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"has usually his darker lines of character, necessary (it may be) to"
10099,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,constitute his greatness. No two men possess the same quantity of the
10100,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"same virtues, if they have many or much. We want some which do not far"
10101,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"outstep us, and which we may follow with the hope of reaching; we want"
10102,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"others to elevate, and others to defend us. The order of things would"
10103,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,be less beautiful without this variety. Without the ebb and flow of
10104,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"our passions, but guided and moderated by a beneficent light above,"
10105,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the ocean of life would stagnate; and zeal, devotion, eloquence, would"
10106,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"become dead carcasses, collapsing and wasting on unprofitable sands."
10107,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"The vices of some men cause the virtues of others, as corruption is"
10108,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the parent of fertility.
10109,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10110,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ O my cousin! this doctrine is diabolical.
10111,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10112,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ What is it?
10113,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10114,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Diabolical; a strong expression in daily use among us. We
10115,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,turn it a little from its origin.
10116,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10117,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Timotheus, I love to sit by the side of a clear water,"
10118,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,although there is nothing in it but naked stones. Do not take the
10119,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,trouble to muddy the stream of language for my benefit; I am not about
10120,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,to fish in it.
10121,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10122,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Well, we will speak about things which come nearer to"
10123,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,your apprehension. I only wish you were somewhat less indifferent in
10124,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,your choice between the true and the false.
10125,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10126,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ We take it for granted that what is not true must be false.
10127,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10128,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Surely we do.
10129,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10130,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ This is erroneous.
10131,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10132,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Are you grown captious? Pray explain.
10133,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10134,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ What is not true, I need not say, must be untrue; but that"
10135,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,alone is false which is intended to deceive. A witness may be
10136,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"mistaken, yet would not you call him a false witness unless he"
10137,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,asserted what he knew to be false.
10138,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10139,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Quibbles upon words!
10140,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10141,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ On words, on quibbles, if you please to call distinctions"
10142,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"so, rests the axis of the intellectual world. A winged word hath stuck"
10143,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"ineradicably in a million hearts, and envenomed every hour throughout"
10144,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,their hard pulsation. On a winged word hath hung the destiny of
10145,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,nations. On a winged word hath human wisdom been willing to cast the
10146,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"immortal soul, and to leave it dependent for all its future happiness."
10147,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"It is because a word is unsusceptible of explanation, or because they"
10148,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"who employed it were impatient of any, that enormous evils have"
10149,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"prevailed, not only against our common sense, but against our common"
10150,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"humanity. Hence the most pernicious of absurdities, far exceeding in"
10151,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"folly and mischief the worship of threescore gods; namely, that an"
10152,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"implicit faith in what outrages our reason, which we know is God's"
10153,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"gift, and bestowed on us for our guidance, that this weak, blind,"
10154,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,stupid faith is surer of His favour than the constant practice of
10155,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"every human virtue. They at whose hands one prodigious lie, such as"
10156,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"this, hath been accepted, may reckon on their influence in the"
10157,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"dissemination of many smaller, and may turn them easily to their own"
10158,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,account. Be sure they will do it sooner or later. The fly floats on
10159,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the surface for a while, but up springs the fish at last and swallows"
10160,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,it.
10161,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10162,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Was ever man so unjust as you are? The abominable old
10163,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,priesthoods are avaricious and luxurious: ours is willing to stand or
10164,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,fall by maintaining its ordinances of fellowship and frugality. Point
10165,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"out to me a priest of our religion whom you could, by any temptation"
10166,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"or entreaty, so far mislead, that he shall reserve for his own"
10167,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"consumption one loaf, one plate of lentils, while another poor"
10168,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Christian hungers. In the meanwhile the priests of Isis are proud and
10169,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"wealthy, and admit none of the indigent to their tables. And now, to"
10170,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"tell you the whole truth, my Cousin Lucian, I come to you this morning"
10171,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,to propose that we should lay our heads together and compose a merry
10172,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,dialogue on these said priests of Isis. What say you?
10173,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10174,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ These said priests of Isis have already been with me,"
10175,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"several times, on a similar business in regard to yours."
10176,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10177,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Malicious wretches!
10178,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10179,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Beside, they have attempted to persuade me that your"
10180,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"religion is borrowed from theirs, altering a name a little and laying"
10181,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the scene of action in a corner, in the midst of obscurity and ruins."
10182,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10183,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ The wicked dogs! the hellish liars! We have nothing in
10184,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,common with such vile impostors. Are they not ashamed of taking such
10185,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,unfair means of lowering us in the estimation of our fellow-citizens?
10186,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"And so, they artfully came to you, craving any spare jibe to throw"
10187,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,against us! They lie open to these weapons; we do not: we stand above
10188,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the malignity, above the strength, of man. You would do justly in"
10189,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,turning their own devices against them: it would be amusing to see how
10190,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"they would look. If you refuse me, I am resolved to write a Dialogue"
10191,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of the Dead, myself, and to introduce these hypocrites in it."
10192,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10193,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Consider well first, my good Timotheus, whether you can do"
10194,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,any such thing with propriety; I mean to say judiciously in regard to
10195,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,composition.
10196,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10197,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ I always thought you generous and open-hearted, and quite"
10198,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,inaccessible to jealousy.
10199,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10200,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Let nobody ever profess himself so much as that: for,"
10201,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"although he may be insensible of the disease, it lurks within him, and"
10202,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"only waits its season to break out. But really, my cousin, at present"
10203,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"I feel no symptoms: and, to prove that I am ingenuous and sincere with"
10204,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"you, these are my reasons for dissuasion. We believers in the Homeric"
10205,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"family of gods and goddesses, believe also in the locality of Tartarus"
10206,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and Elysium. We entertain no doubt whatever that the passions of men
10207,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and demigods and gods are nearly the same above ground and below; and
10208,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,that Achilles would dispatch his spear through the body of any shade
10209,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"who would lead Briseis too far among the myrtles, or attempt to throw"
10210,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the halter over the ears of any chariot horse belonging to him in the
10211,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"meads of asphodel. We admit no doubt of these verities, delivered down"
10212,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,to us from the ages when Theseus and Hercules had descended into Hades
10213,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"itself. Instead of a few stadions in a cavern, with a bank and a bower"
10214,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"at the end of it, under a very small portion of our diminutive Hellas,"
10215,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"you Christians possess the whole cavity of the earth for punishment,"
10216,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and the whole convex of the sky for felicity.
10217,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10218,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Our passions are burnt out amid the fires of
10219,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"purification, and our intellects are elevated to the enjoyment of"
10220,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,perfect intelligence.
10221,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10222,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ How silly then and incongruous would it be, not to say how"
10223,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"impious, to represent your people as no better and no wiser than they"
10224,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"were before, and discoursing on subjects which no longer can or ought"
10225,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,to concern them. Christians must think your Dialogue of the Dead no
10226,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"less irreligious than their opponents think mine, and infinitely more"
10227,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"absurd. If indeed you are resolved on this form of composition, there"
10228,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"is no topic which may not, with equal facility, be discussed on"
10229,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"earth; and you may intersperse as much ridicule as you please, without"
10230,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,any fear of censure for inconsistency or irreverence. Hitherto such
10231,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"writers have confined their view mostly to speculative points,"
10232,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"sophistic reasonings, and sarcastic interpellations."
10233,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10234,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Ha! you are always fond of throwing a little pebble at
10235,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the lofty Plato, whom we, on the contrary, are ready to receive (in a"
10236,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,manner) as one of ourselves.
10237,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10238,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ To throw pebbles is a very uncertain way of showing where
10239,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"lie defects. Whenever I have mentioned him seriously, I have brought"
10240,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"forward, not accusations, but passages from his writings, such as no"
10241,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,philosopher or scholar or moralist can defend.
10242,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10243,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ His doctrines are too abstruse and too sublime for you.
10244,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10245,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Solon, Anaxagoras, and Epicurus, are more sublime, if truth"
10246,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,is sublimity.
10247,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10248,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Truth is, indeed; for God is truth."
10249,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10250,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ We are upon earth to learn what can be learnt upon earth,"
10251,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and not to speculate on what never can be. This you, O Timotheus, may"
10252,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,call philosophy: to me it appears the idlest of curiosity; for every
10253,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"other kind may teach us something, and may lead to more beyond. Let"
10254,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"men learn what benefits men; above all things, to contract their"
10255,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"wishes, to calm their passions, and, more especially, to dispel their"
10256,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"fears. Now these are to be dispelled, not by collecting clouds, but by"
10257,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,piercing and scattering them. In the dark we may imagine depths and
10258,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"heights immeasurable, which, if a torch be carried right before us, we"
10259,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,find it easy to leap across. Much of what we call sublime is only the
10260,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"residue of infancy, and the worst of it."
10261,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10262,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,The philosophers I quoted are too capacious for schools and systems.
10263,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Without noise, without ostentation, without mystery, not quarrelsome,"
10264,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"not captious, not frivolous, their lives were commentaries on their"
10265,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"doctrine. Never evaporating into mist, never stagnating into mire,"
10266,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,their limpid and broad morality runs parallel with the lofty summits
10267,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,of their genius.
10268,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10269,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Genius! was ever genius like Plato's?
10270,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10271,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ The most admired of his Dialogues, his _Banquet_, is beset"
10272,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"with such puerilities, deformed with such pedantry, and disgraced with"
10273,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"such impurity, that none but the thickest beards, and chiefly of the"
10274,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"philosophers and the satyrs, should bend over it. On a former occasion"
10275,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"he has given us a specimen of history, than which nothing in our"
10276,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"language is worse: here he gives us one of poetry, in honour of Love,"
10277,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"for which the god has taken ample vengeance on him, by perverting his"
10278,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,taste and feelings. The grossest of all the absurdities in this
10279,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"dialogue is, attributing to Aristophanes, so much of a scoffer and so"
10280,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"little of a visionary, the silly notion of male and female having been"
10281,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"originally complete in one person, and walking circuitously. He may be"
10282,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,joking: who knows?
10283,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10284,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Forbear! forbear! do not call this notion a silly one:
10285,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"he took it from our Holy Scriptures, but perverted it somewhat. Woman"
10286,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"was made from man's rib, and did not require to be cut asunder all"
10287,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the way down: this is no proof of bad reasoning, but merely of"
10288,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,misinterpretation.
10289,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10290,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ If you would rather have bad reasoning, I will adduce a"
10291,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"little of it. Farther on, he wishes to extol the wisdom of Agathon by"
10292,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,attributing to him such a sentence as this:
10293,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10294,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"'It is evident that Love is the most beautiful of the gods, _because_"
10295,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,he is the youngest of them.'
10296,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10297,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Now, even on earth, the youngest is not always the most beautiful; how"
10298,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"infinitely less cogent, then, is the argument when we come to speak of"
10299,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the Immortals, with whom age can have no concern! There was a time"
10300,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"when Vulcan was the youngest of the gods: was he, also, at that time,"
10301,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and for that reason, the most beautiful? Your philosopher tells us,"
10302,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"moreover, that 'Love is of all deities the most _liquid_; else he"
10303,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"never could fold himself about everything, and flow into and out of"
10304,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,men's souls.'
10305,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10306,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"The three last sentences of Agathon's rhapsody are very harmonious,"
10307,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and exhibit the finest specimen of Plato's style; but we, accustomed"
10308,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"as we are to hear him lauded for his poetical diction, should hold"
10309,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,that poem a very indifferent one which left on the mind so superficial
10310,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"an impression. The garden of Academus is flowery without fragrance,"
10311,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and dazzling without warmth: I am ready to dream away an hour in it
10312,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"after dinner, but I think it insalutary for a night's repose. So"
10313,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"satisfied was Plato with his _Banquet_, that he says of himself, in"
10314,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the person of Socrates, 'How can I or any one but find it difficult to"
10315,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,speak after a discourse so eloquent? It would have been wonderful if
10316,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the brilliancy of the sentences at the end of it, and the choice of"
10317,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"expression throughout, had not astonished all the auditors. I, who can"
10318,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"never say anything nearly so beautiful, would if possible have made my"
10319,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"escape, and have fairly run off for shame.' He had indeed much better"
10320,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,run off before he made so wretched a pun on the name of Gorgias. 'I
10321,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"dreaded,' says he, 'lest Agathon, _measuring my discourse by the head"
10322,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of the eloquent Gorgias, should turn me to stone_ for inability of"
10323,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,utterance.'
10324,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10325,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Was there ever joke more frigid? What painful twisting of unelastic
10326,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"stuff! If Socrates was the wisest man in the world, it would require"
10327,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"another oracle to persuade us, after this, that he was the wittiest."
10328,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,But surely a small share of common sense would have made him abstain
10329,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,from hazarding such failures. He falls on his face in very flat and
10330,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"very dry ground; and, when he gets up again, his quibbles are"
10331,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"well-nigh as tedious as his witticisms. However, he has the presence"
10332,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of mind to throw them on the shoulders of Diotima, whom he calls a"
10333,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"prophetess, and who, ten years before the plague broke out in Athens,"
10334,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,obtained from the gods (he tells us) that delay. Ah! the gods were
10335,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"doubly mischievous: they sent her first. Read her words, my cousin, as"
10336,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,delivered by Socrates; and if they have another plague in store for
10337,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"us, you may avert it by such an act of expiation."
10338,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10339,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ The world will have ended before ten years are over.
10340,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10341,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Indeed!
10342,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10343,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ It has been pronounced.
10344,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10345,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ How the threads of belief and unbelief run woven close
10346,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"together in the whole web of human life! Come, come; take courage; you"
10347,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,will have time for your Dialogue. Enlarge the circle; enrich it with a
10348,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"variety of matter, enliven it with a multitude of characters, occupy"
10349,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the intellect of the thoughtful, the imagination of the lively; spread"
10350,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the board with solid viands, delicate rarities, and sparkling wines;"
10351,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and throw, along the whole extent of it, geniality and festal crowns."
10352,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10353,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ What writer of dialogues hath ever done this, or"
10354,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"undertaken, or conceived, or hoped it?"
10355,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10356,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ None whatever; yet surely you yourself may, when even your"
10357,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,babes and sucklings are endowed with abilities incomparably greater
10358,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,than our niggardly old gods have bestowed on the very best of us.
10359,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10360,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ I wish, my dear Lucian, you would let our babes and"
10361,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"sucklings lie quiet, and say no more about them: as for your gods, I"
10362,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,leave them at your mercy. Do not impose on me the performance of a
10363,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"task in which Plato himself, if he had attempted it, would have"
10364,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,failed.
10365,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10366,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ No man ever detected false reasoning with more quickness;
10367,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"but unluckily he called in Wit at the exposure; and Wit, I am sorry to"
10368,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"say, held the lowest place in his household. He sadly mistook the"
10369,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"qualities of his mind in attempting the facetious; or, rather, he"
10370,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"fancied he possessed one quality more than belonged to him. But, if he"
10371,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,himself had not been a worse quibbler than any whose writings are come
10372,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"down to us, we might have been gratified by the exposure of wonderful"
10373,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,acuteness wretchedly applied. It is no small service to the community
10374,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to turn into ridicule the grave impostors, who are contending which of"
10375,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"them shall guide and govern us, whether in politics or religion. There"
10376,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,are always a few who will take the trouble to walk down among the
10377,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"seaweeds and slippery stones, for the sake of showing their credulous"
10378,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"fellow-citizens that skins filled with sand, and set upright at the"
10379,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"forecastle, are neither men nor merchandise."
10380,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10381,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ I can bring to mind, O Lucian, no writer possessing so"
10382,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,great a variety of wit as you.
10383,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10384,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ No man ever possessed any variety of this gift; and the
10385,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,holder is not allowed to exchange the quality for another. Banter (and
10386,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"such is Plato's) never grows large, never sheds its bristles, and"
10387,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,never do they soften into the humorous or the facetious.
10388,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10389,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ I agree with you that banter is the worst species of wit.
10390,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,We have indeed no correct idea what persons those really were whom
10391,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Plato drags by the ears, to undergo slow torture under Socrates. One"
10392,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"sophist, I must allow, is precisely like another: no discrimination of"
10393,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"character, none of manner, none of language."
10394,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10395,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ He wanted the fancy and fertility of Aristophanes.
10396,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10397,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Otherwise, his mind was more elevated and more poetical."
10398,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10399,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Pardon me if I venture to express my dissent in both
10400,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"particulars. Knowledge of the human heart, and discrimination of"
10401,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"character, are requisites of the poet. Few ever have possessed them in"
10402,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,an equal degree with Aristophanes: Plato has given no indication of
10403,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,either.
10404,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10405,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ But consider his imagination.
10406,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10407,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ On what does it rest? He is nowhere so imaginative as in his
10408,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Polity_. Nor is there any state in the world that is, or would be,"
10409,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,governed by it. One day you may find him at his counter in the midst
10410,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of old-fashioned toys, which crack and crumble under his fingers while"
10411,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"he exhibits and recommends them; another day, while he is sitting on a"
10412,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"goat's bladder, I may discover his bald head surmounting an enormous"
10413,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"mass of loose chaff and uncleanly feathers, which he would persuade"
10414,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"you is the pleasantest and healthiest of beds, and that dreams descend"
10415,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,on it from the gods.
10416,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10417,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"'Open your mouth, and shut your eyes, and see what Zeus shall"
10418,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"send you,'"
10419,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10420,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,says Aristophanes in his favourite metre. In this helpless condition
10421,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of closed optics and hanging jaw, we find the followers of Plato. It"
10422,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"is by shutting their eyes that they see, and by opening their mouths"
10423,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"that they apprehend. Like certain broad-muzzled dogs, all stand"
10424,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"equally stiff and staunch, although few scent the game, and their lips"
10425,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"wag, and water, at whatever distance from the net. We must leave them"
10426,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"with their hands hanging down before them, confident that they are"
10427,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"wiser than we are, were it only for this attitude of humility. It is"
10428,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"amusing to see them in it before the tall, well-robed Athenian, while"
10429,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"he mis-spells the charms, and plays clumsily the tricks, he acquired"
10430,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,from the conjurors here in Egypt. I wish you better success with the
10431,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,same materials. But in my opinion all philosophers should speak
10432,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,clearly. The highest things are the purest and brightest; and the best
10433,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,writers are those who render them the most intelligible to the world
10434,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"below. In the arts and sciences, and particularly in music and"
10435,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"metaphysics, this is difficult: but the subjects not being such as lie"
10436,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"within the range of the community, I lay little stress upon them, and"
10437,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"wish authors to deal with them as they best may, only beseeching that"
10438,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"they recompense us, by bringing within our comprehension the other"
10439,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,things with which they are entrusted for us. The followers of Plato
10440,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,fly off indignantly from any such proposal. If I ask them the meaning
10441,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of some obscure passage, they answer that I am unprepared and unfitted"
10442,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"for it, and that his mind is so far above mine, I cannot grasp it. I"
10443,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"look up into the faces of these worthy men, who mingle so much"
10444,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"commiseration with so much calmness, and wonder at seeing them look no"
10445,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,less vacant than my own.
10446,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10447,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ You have acknowledged his eloquence, while you derided"
10448,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,his philosophy and repudiated his morals.
10449,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10450,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Certainly there was never so much eloquence with so little
10451,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"animation. When he has heated his oven, he forgets to put the bread"
10452,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"into it; instead of which, he throws in another bundle of faggots. His"
10453,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,words and sentences are often too large for the place they occupy. If
10454,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"a water-melon is not to be placed in an oyster-shell, neither is a"
10455,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,grain of millet in a golden salver. At high festivals a full band may
10456,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,enter: ordinary conversation goes on better without it.
10457,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10458,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ There is something so spiritual about him, that many of"
10459,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,us Christians are firmly of opinion he must have been partially
10460,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,enlightened from above.
10461,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10462,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I hope and believe we all are. His entire works are in our
10463,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,library. Do me the favour to point out to me a few of those passages
10464,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"where in poetry he approaches the spirit of Aristophanes, or where in"
10465,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,morals he comes up to Epictetus.
10466,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10467,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ It is useless to attempt it if you carry your prejudices
10468,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"with you. Beside, my dear cousin, I would not offend you, but really"
10469,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,your mind has no point about it which could be brought to contact or
10470,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,affinity with Plato's.
10471,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10472,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ In the universality of his genius there must surely be some
10473,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"atom coincident with another in mine. You acknowledge, as everybody"
10474,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"must do, that his wit is the heaviest and lowest: pray, is the"
10475,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,specimen he has given us of history at all better?
10476,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10477,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ I would rather look to the loftiness of his mind, and the"
10478,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,genius that sustains him.
10479,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10480,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ So would I. Magnificent words, and the pomp and procession"
10481,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of stately sentences, may accompany genius, but are not always nor"
10482,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,frequently called out by it. The voice ought not to be perpetually nor
10483,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"much elevated in the ethic and didactic, nor to roll sonorously, as if"
10484,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,it issued from a mask in the theatre. The horses in the plain under
10485,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Troy are not always kicking and neighing; nor is the dust always
10486,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,raised in whirlwinds on the banks of Simois and Scamander; nor are the
10487,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,rampires always in a blaze. Hector has lowered his helmet to the
10488,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"infant of Andromache, and Achilles to the embraces of Briseis. I do"
10489,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,not blame the prose-writer who opens his bosom occasionally to a
10490,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"breath of poetry; neither, on the contrary, can I praise the gait of"
10491,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,that pedestrian who lifts up his legs as high on a bare heath as in a
10492,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"cornfield. Be authority as old and obstinate as it may, never let it"
10493,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,persuade you that a man is the stronger for being unable to keep
10494,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"himself on the ground, or the weaker for breathing quietly and softly"
10495,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"on ordinary occasions. Tell me, over and over, that you find every"
10496,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"great quality in Plato: let me only once ask you in return, whether he"
10497,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"ever is ardent and energetic, whether he wins the affections, whether"
10498,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,he agitates the heart. Finding him deficient in every one of these
10499,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"faculties, I think his disciples have extolled him too highly. Where"
10500,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"power is absent, we may find the robes of genius, but we miss the"
10501,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"throne. He would acquit a slave who killed another in self-defence,"
10502,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"but if he killed any free man, even in self-defence; he was not only"
10503,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to be punished with death, but to undergo the cruel death of a"
10504,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,parricide. This effeminate philosopher was more severe than the manly
10505,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Demosthenes, who quotes a law against the striking of a slave: and"
10506,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Diogenes, when one ran away from him, remarked that it would be"
10507,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"horrible if Diogenes could not do without a slave, when a slave could"
10508,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,do without Diogenes.
10509,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10510,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Surely the allegories of Plato are evidences of his
10511,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,genius.
10512,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10513,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ A great poet in the hours of his idleness may indulge in
10514,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,allegory: but the highest poetical character will never rest on so
10515,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"unsubstantial a foundation. The poet must take man from God's hands,"
10516,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"must look into every fibre of his heart and brain, must be able to"
10517,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"take the magnificent work to pieces, and to reconstruct it. When this"
10518,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"labour is completed, let him throw himself composedly on the earth,"
10519,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and care little how many of its ephemeral insects creep over him. In
10520,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"regard to these allegories of Plato, about which I have heard so much,"
10521,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"pray what and where are they? You hesitate, my fair cousin Timotheus!"
10522,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Employ one morning in transcribing them, and another in noting all the"
10523,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,passages which are of practical utility in the commerce of social
10524,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"life, or purify our affections at home, or excite and elevate our"
10525,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"enthusiasm in the prosperity and glory of our country. Useful books,"
10526,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"moral books, instructive books are easily composed: and surely so"
10527,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,great a writer should present them to us without blot or blemish: I
10528,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,find among his many volumes no copy of a similar composition. My
10529,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,enthusiasm is not easily raised indeed; yet such a whirlwind of a poet
10530,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"must carry it away with him; nevertheless, here I stand, calm and"
10531,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"collected, not a hair of my beard in commotion. Declamation will find"
10532,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,its echo in vacant places: it beats ineffectually on the
10533,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,well-furnished mind. Give me proof; bring the work; show the passages;
10534,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"convince, confound, overwhelm me."
10535,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10536,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ I may do that another time with Plato. And yet, what"
10537,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,effect can I hope to produce on an unhappy man who doubts even that
10538,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the world is on the point of extinction?
10539,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10540,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Are there many of your association who believe that this
10541,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,catastrophe is so near at hand?
10542,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10543,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ We all believe it; or rather, we all are certain of it."
10544,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10545,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ How so? Have you observed any fracture in the disk of the
10546,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,sun? Are any of the stars loosened in their orbits? Has the beautiful
10547,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"light of Venus ceased to pant in the heavens, or has the belt of Orion"
10548,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,lost its gems?
10549,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10550,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Oh, for shame!"
10551,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10552,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Rather should I be ashamed of indifference on so important
10553,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,an occasion.
10554,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10555,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ We know the fact by surer signs.
10556,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10557,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ These, if you could vouch for them, would be sure enough for"
10558,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,me. The least of them would make me sweat as profusely as if I stood
10559,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,up to the neck in the hot preparation of a mummy. Surely no wise or
10560,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,benevolent philosopher could ever have uttered what he knew or
10561,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,believed might be distorted into any such interpretation. For if men
10562,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"are persuaded that they and their works are so soon about to perish,"
10563,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,what provident care are they likely to take in the education and
10564,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"welfare of their families? What sciences will they improve, what"
10565,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"learning will they cultivate, what monuments of past ages will they be"
10566,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"studious to preserve, who are certain that there can be no future"
10567,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"ones? Poetry will be censured as rank profaneness, eloquence will be"
10568,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"converted into howls and execrations, statuary will exhibit only"
10569,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Midases and Ixions, and all the colours of painting will be mixed"
10570,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,together to produce one grand conflagration: _flammantia moenia
10571,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,mundi_.
10572,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10573,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Do not quote an atheist; especially in Latin. I hate the
10574,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,language; the Romans are beginning to differ from us already.
10575,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10576,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Ah! you will soon split into smaller fractions. But pardon
10577,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,me my unusual fault of quoting. Before I let fall a quotation I must
10578,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"be taken by surprise. I seldom do it in conversation, seldomer in"
10579,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"composition; for it mars the beauty and unity of style, especially"
10580,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,when it invades it from a foreign tongue. A quoter is either
10581,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,ostentatious of his acquirements or doubtful of his cause. And
10582,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"moreover, he never walks gracefully who leans upon the shoulder of"
10583,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"another, however gracefully that other may walk. Herodotus, Plato,"
10584,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Aristoteles, Demosthenes, are no quoters. Thucydides, twice or thrice,"
10585,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,inserts a few sentences of Pericles: but Thucydides is an emanation of
10586,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Pericles, somewhat less clear indeed, being lower, although at no"
10587,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,great distance from that purest and most pellucid source. The best of
10588,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the Romans, I agree with you, are remote from such originals, if not"
10589,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"in power of mind, or in acuteness of remark, or in sobriety of"
10590,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"judgment, yet in the graces of composition. While I admired, with a"
10591,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"species of awe such as not Homer himself ever impressed me with, the"
10592,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"majesty and sanctimony of Livy, I have been informed by learned Romans"
10593,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"that in the structure of his sentences he is often inharmonious, and"
10594,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,sometimes uncouth. I can imagine such uncouthness in the goddess of
10595,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"battles, confident of power and victory, when part of her hair is"
10596,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"waving round the helmet, loosened by the rapidity of her descent or"
10597,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the vibration of her spear. Composition may be too adorned even for
10598,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,beauty. In painting it is often requisite to cover a bright colour
10599,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"with one less bright; and, in language, to relieve the ear from the"
10600,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"tension of high notes, even at the cost of a discord. There are urns"
10601,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of which the borders are too prominent and too decorated for use, and"
10602,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"which appear to be brought out chiefly for state, at grand carousals."
10603,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"The author who imitates the artificers of these, shall never have my"
10604,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,custom.
10605,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10606,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ I think you judge rightly: but I do not understand
10607,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,languages: I only understand religion.
10608,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10609,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ He must be a most accomplished, a most extraordinary man,"
10610,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,who comprehends them both together. We do not even talk clearly when
10611,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,we are walking in the dark.
10612,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10613,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Thou art not merely walking in the dark, but fast asleep."
10614,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10615,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ And thou, my cousin, wouldst kindly awaken me with a red-hot"
10616,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,poker. I have but a few paces to go along the corridor of life:
10617,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,prithee let me turn into my bed again and lie quiet. Never was any man
10618,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"less an enemy to religion than I am, whatever may be said to the"
10619,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,contrary: and you shall judge of me by the soundness of my advice. If
10620,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"your leaders are in earnest, as many think, do persuade them to"
10621,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"abstain from quarrelsomeness and contention, and not to declare it"
10622,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,necessary that there should perpetually be a religious as well as a
10623,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,political war between east and west. No honest and considerate man
10624,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"will believe in their doctrines, who, inculcating peace and good-will,"
10625,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,continue all the time to assail their fellow-citizens with the utmost
10626,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"rancour at every divergency of opinion, and, forbidding the indulgence"
10627,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of the kindlier affections, exercise at full stretch the fiercer. This"
10628,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"is certain: if they obey any commander, they will never sound a charge"
10629,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,when his order is to sound a retreat: if they acknowledge any
10630,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"magistrate, they will never tear down the tablet of his edicts."
10631,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10632,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ We have what is all-sufficient.
10633,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10634,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I see you have.
10635,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10636,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ You have ridiculed all religion and all philosophy.
10637,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10638,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I have found but little of either. I have cracked many a
10639,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"nut, and have come only to dust or maggots."
10640,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10641,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ To say nothing of the saints, are all philosophers fools"
10642,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"or impostors? And, because you cannot rise to the ethereal heights of"
10643,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Plato, nor comprehend the real magnitude of a man so much above you,"
10644,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,must he be a dwarf?
10645,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10646,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ The best sight is not that which sees best in the dark or
10647,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the twilight; for no objects are then visible in their true colours,"
10648,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and just proportions; but it is that which presents to us things as
10649,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"they are, and indicates what is within our reach and what is beyond"
10650,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"it. Never were any three writers, of high celebrity, so little"
10651,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"understood in the main character, as Plato, Diogenes, and Epicurus."
10652,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Plato is a perfect master of logic and rhetoric; and whenever he errs
10653,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"in either, as I have proved to you he does occasionally, he errs"
10654,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"through perverseness, not through unwariness. His language often"
10655,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"settles into clear and most beautiful prose, often takes an imperfect"
10656,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and incoherent shape of poetry, and often, cloud against cloud, bursts"
10657,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,with a vehement detonation in the air. Diogenes was hated both by the
10658,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"vulgar and the philosophers. By the philosophers, because he exposed"
10659,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"their ignorance, ridiculed their jealousies, and rebuked their pride:"
10660,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"by the vulgar, because they never can endure a man apparently of their"
10661,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,own class who avoids their society and partakes in none of their
10662,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"humours, prejudices, and animosities. What right has he to be greater"
10663,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"or better than they are? he who wears older clothes, who eats staler"
10664,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"fish, and possesses no vote to imprison or banish anybody. I am now"
10665,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"ashamed that I mingled in the rabble, and that I could not resist the"
10666,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,childish mischief of smoking him in his tub. He was the wisest man of
10667,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"his time, not excepting Aristoteles; for he knew that he was greater"
10668,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,than Philip or Alexander. Aristoteles did not know that he himself
10669,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"was, or knowing it, did not act up to his knowledge; and here is a"
10670,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,deficiency of wisdom.
10671,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10672,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Whether you did or did not strike the cask, Diogenes"
10673,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,would have closed his eyes equally. He would never have come forth and
10674,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"seen the truth, had it shone upon the world in that day. But,"
10675,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"intractable as was this recluse, Epicurus, I fear, is quite as"
10676,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,lamentable. What horrible doctrines!
10677,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10678,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Enjoy, said he, the pleasant walks where you are: repose and"
10679,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,eat gratefully the fruit that falls into your bosom: do not weary your
10680,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"feet with an excursion, at the end whereof you will find no"
10681,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,resting-place: reject not the odour of roses for the fumes of pitch
10682,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and sulphur. What horrible doctrines!
10683,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10684,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Speak seriously. He was much too bad for ridicule.
10685,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10686,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ I will then speak as you desire me, seriously. His smile"
10687,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"was so unaffected and so graceful, that I should have thought it very"
10688,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,injudicious to set my laugh against it. No philosopher ever lived with
10689,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"such uniform purity, such abstinence from censoriousness, from"
10690,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"controversy, from jealousy, and from arrogance."
10691,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10692,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Ah, poor mortal! I pity him, as far as may be; he is in"
10693,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,hell: it would be wicked to wish him out: we are not to murmur against
10694,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the all-wise dispensations.
10695,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10696,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I am sure he would not; and it is therefore I hope he is
10697,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,more comfortable than you believe.
10698,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10699,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Never have I defiled my fingers, and never will I defile"
10700,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"them, by turning over his writings. But in regard to Plato, I can have"
10701,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,no objection to take your advice.
10702,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10703,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ He will reward your assiduity: but he will assist you very
10704,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,little if you consult him principally (and eloquence for this should
10705,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,principally be consulted) to strengthen your humanity. Grandiloquent
10706,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and sonorous, his lungs seem to play the better for the absence of the"
10707,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"heart. His imagination is the most conspicuous, buoyed up by swelling"
10708,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"billows over unsounded depths. There are his mild thunders, there are"
10709,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"his glowing clouds, his traversing coruscations, and his shooting"
10710,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"stars. More of true wisdom, more of trustworthy manliness, more of"
10711,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,promptitude and power to keep you steady and straightforward on the
10712,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"perilous road of life, may be found in the little manual of Epictetus,"
10713,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"which I could write in the palm of my left hand, than there is in all"
10714,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the rolling and redundant volumes of this mighty rhetorician, which"
10715,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"you may begin to transcribe on the summit of the Great Pyramid, carry"
10716,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"down over the Sphinx at the bottom, and continue on the sands half-way"
10717,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,to Memphis. And indeed the materials are appropriate; one part being
10718,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"far above our sight, and the other on what, by the most befitting"
10719,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"epithet, Homer calls the _no-corn-bearing_."
10720,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10721,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ There are many who will stand against you on this ground.
10722,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10723,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ With what perfect ease and fluency do some of the dullest
10724,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,men in existence toss over and discuss the most elaborate of all
10725,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,works! How many myriads of such creatures would be insufficient to
10726,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,furnish intellect enough for any single paragraph in them! Yet '_we
10727,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"think this_', '_we advise that_', are expressions now become so"
10728,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"customary, that it would be difficult to turn them into ridicule. We"
10729,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"must pull the creatures out while they are in the very act, and show"
10730,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,who and what they are. One of these fellows said to Caius Fuscus in my
10731,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"hearing, that there was a time when it was permitted him to doubt"
10732,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"occasionally on particular points of criticism, but that the time was"
10733,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,now over.
10734,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10735,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ And what did you think of such arrogance? What did you
10736,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,reply to such impertinence?
10737,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10738,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Let me answer one question at a time. First: I thought him a
10739,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"legitimate fool, of the purest breed. Secondly: I promised him I would"
10740,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"always be contented with the judgment he had rejected, leaving him and"
10741,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,his friends in the enjoyment of the rest.
10742,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10743,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ And what said he?
10744,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10745,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I forget. He seemed pleased at my acknowledgment of his
10746,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"discrimination, at my deference and delicacy. He wished, however, I"
10747,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"had studied Plato, Xenophon, and Cicero, more attentively; without"
10748,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"which preparatory discipline, no two persons could be introduced"
10749,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"advantageously into a dialogue. I agreed with him on this position,"
10750,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,remarking that we ourselves were at that very time giving our sentence
10751,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"on the fact. He suggested a slight mistake on my side, and expressed a"
10752,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,wish that he were conversing with a writer able to sustain the
10753,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"opposite part. With his experience and skill in rhetoric, his long"
10754,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"habitude of composition, his knowledge of life, of morals, and of"
10755,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"character, he should be less verbose than Cicero, less gorgeous than"
10756,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Plato, and less trimly attired than Xenophon."
10757,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10758,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ If he spoke in that manner, he might indeed be ridiculed"
10759,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"for conceitedness and presumption, but his language is not altogether"
10760,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,a fool's.
10761,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10762,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ I deliver his sentiments, not his words: for who would read,"
10763,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"or who would listen to me, if such fell from me as from him? Poetry"
10764,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"has its probabilities, so has prose: when people cry out against the"
10765,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"representation of a dullard, _Could he have spoken all that?_"
10766,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"'Certainly no,' is the reply: neither did Priam implore, in harmonious"
10767,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"verse, the pity of Achilles. We say only what might be said, when"
10768,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,great postulates are conceded.
10769,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10770,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ We will pretermit these absurd and silly men: but, Cousin"
10771,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Lucian! Cousin Lucian! the name of Plato will be durable as that of
10772,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Sesostris.
10773,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10774,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ So will the pebbles and bricks which gangs of slaves erected
10775,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,into a pyramid. I do not hold Sesostris in much higher estimation than
10776,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"those quieter lumps of matter. They, O Timotheus, who survive the"
10777,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"wreck of ages, are by no means, as a body, the worthiest of our"
10778,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"admiration. It is in these wrecks, as in those at sea, the best things"
10779,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,are not always saved. Hen-coops and empty barrels bob upon the
10780,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"surface, under a serene and smiling sky, when the graven or depicted"
10781,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"images of the gods are scattered on invisible rocks, and when those"
10782,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,who most resemble them in knowledge and beneficence are devoured by
10783,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,cold monsters below.
10784,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10785,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ You now talk reasonably, seriously, almost religiously."
10786,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Do you ever pray?
10787,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10788,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I do. It was no longer than five years ago that I was
10789,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,deprived by death of my dog Melanops. He had uniformly led an innocent
10790,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"life; for I never would let him walk out with me, lest he should bring"
10791,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"home in his mouth the remnant of some god or other, and at last get"
10792,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,bitten or stung by one. I reminded Anubis of this: and moreover I told
10793,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"him, what he ought to be aware of, that Melanops did honour to his"
10794,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,relationship.
10795,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10796,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ I cannot ever call it piety to pray for dumb and dead
10797,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,beasts.
10798,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10799,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Timotheus! Timotheus! have you no heart? have you no dog? do
10800,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,you always pray only for yourself?
10801,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10802,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ We do not believe that dogs can live again.
10803,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10804,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ More shame for you! If they enjoy and suffer, if they hope"
10805,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and fear, if calamities and wrongs befall them, such as agitate their"
10806,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,hearts and excite their apprehensions; if they possess the option of
10807,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"being grateful or malicious, and choose the worthier; if they exercise"
10808,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the same sound judgment on many other occasions, some for their own"
10809,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"benefit and some for the benefit of their masters, they have as good a"
10810,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"chance of a future life, and a better chance of a happy one, than half"
10811,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the priests of all the religions in the world. Wherever there is the
10812,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"choice of doing well or ill, and that choice (often against a first"
10813,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"impulse) decides for well, there must not only be a soul of the same"
10814,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"nature as man's, although of less compass and comprehension, but,"
10815,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"being of the same nature, the same immortality must appertain to it;"
10816,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"for spirit, like body, may change, but cannot be annihilated."
10817,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10818,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,It was among the prejudices of former times that pigs are uncleanly
10819,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"animals, and fond of wallowing in the mire for mire's sake. Philosophy"
10820,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"has now discovered that when they roll in mud and ordure, it is only"
10821,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"from an excessive love of cleanliness, and a vehement desire to rid"
10822,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"themselves of scabs and vermin. Unfortunately, doubts keep pace with"
10823,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"discoveries. They are like warts, of which the blood that springs from"
10824,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"a great one extirpated, makes twenty little ones."
10825,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10826,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ The Hydra would be a more noble simile.
10827,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10828,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I was indeed about to illustrate my position by the old
10829,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Hydra, so ready at hand and so tractable; but I will never take hold"
10830,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of a hydra, when a wart will serve my turn."
10831,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10832,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Continue then.
10833,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10834,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Even children are now taught, in despite of Aesop, that"
10835,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,animals never spoke. The uttermost that can be advanced with any show
10836,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of confidence is, that if they spoke at all, they spoke in unknown"
10837,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"tongues. Supposing the fact, is this a reason why they should not be"
10838,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"respected? Quite the contrary. If the tongues were unknown, it tends"
10839,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to demonstrate _our_ ignorance, not _theirs_. If we could not"
10840,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"understand them, while they possessed the gift, here is no proof that"
10841,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"they did not speak to the purpose, but only that it was not to _our_"
10842,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,purpose; which may likewise be said with equal certainty of the wisest
10843,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"men that ever existed. How little have we learned from them, for the"
10844,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"conduct of life or the avoidance of calamity! Unknown tongues, indeed!"
10845,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"yes, so are all tongues to the vulgar and the negligent."
10846,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10847,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ It comforts me to hear you talk in this manner, without a"
10848,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,glance at our gifts and privileges.
10849,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10850,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ I am less incredulous than you suppose, my cousin! Indeed I"
10851,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,have been giving you what ought to be a sufficient proof of it.
10852,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10853,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ You have spoken with becoming gravity, I must confess."
10854,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10855,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Let me then submit to your judgment some fragments of
10856,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,history which have lately fallen into my hands. There is among them a
10857,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_hymn_, of which the metre is so incondite, and the phraseology so"
10858,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"ancient, that the grammarians have attributed it to Linus. But the"
10859,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"hymn will interest you less, and is less to our purpose, than the"
10860,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,tradition; by which it appears that certain priests of high antiquity
10861,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,were of the brute creation.
10862,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10863,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ No better, any of them."
10864,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10865,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Now you have polished the palms of your hands, I will"
10866,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,commence my narrative from the manuscript.
10867,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10868,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Pray do.
10869,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10870,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ There existed in the city of Nephosis a fraternity of
10871,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"priests, reverenced by the appellation of _Gasteres_. It is reported"
10872,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"that they were not always of their present form, but were birds"
10873,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"aquatic and migratory, a species of cormorant. The poet Linus, who"
10874,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"lived nearer the transformation (if there indeed was any), sings thus,"
10875,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,in his Hymn to Zeus:
10876,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10877,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"'Thy power is manifest, O Zeus! in the Gasteres. Wild birds were they,"
10878,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"strong of talon, clanging of wing, and clamorous of gullet. Wild"
10879,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"birds, O Zeus! wild birds; now cropping the tender grass by the river"
10880,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of Adonis, and breaking the nascent reed at the root, and depasturing"
10881,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the sweet nymphaea; now again picking up serpents and other creeping
10882,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"things on each hand of old Aegyptos, whose head is hidden in the"
10883,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,clouds.
10884,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10885,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,'Oh that Mnemosyne would command the staidest of her three daughters
10886,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,to stand and sing before me! to sing clearly and strongly. How before
10887,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"thy throne, Saturnian! sharp voices arose, even the voices of Her√© and"
10888,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of thy children. How they cried out that innumerable mortal men,"
10889,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"various-tongued, kid-roasters in tent and tabernacle, devising in"
10890,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,their many-turning hearts and thoughtful minds how to fabricate
10891,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"well-rounded spits of beech-tree, how such men having been changed"
10892,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"into brute animals, it behoved thee to trim the balance, and in thy"
10893,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,wisdom to change sundry brute animals into men; in order that they
10894,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"might pour out flame-coloured wine unto thee, and sprinkle the white"
10895,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"flower of the sea upon the thighs of many bulls, to pleasure thee."
10896,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Then didst thou, O storm-driver! overshadow far lands with thy dark"
10897,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"eyebrows, looking down on them, to accomplish thy will. And then didst"
10898,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"thou behold the Gasteres, fat, tall, prominent-crested, purple-legged,"
10899,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"daedal-plumed, white and black, changeable in colour as Iris. And lo!"
10900,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"thou didst will it, and they were men.'"
10901,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10902,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ No doubt whatever can be entertained of this hymn's
10903,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,antiquity. But what farther says the historian?
10904,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10905,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ I will read on, to gratify you."
10906,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10907,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,'It is recorded that this ancient order of a most lordly priesthood
10908,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"went through many changes of customs and ceremonies, which indeed they"
10909,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,were always ready to accommodate to the maintenance of their authority
10910,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and the enjoyment of their riches. It is recorded that, in the"
10911,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"beginning, they kept various tame animals, and some wild ones, within"
10912,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the precincts of the temple: nevertheless, after a time, they applied"
10913,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to their own uses everything they could lay their hands on, whatever"
10914,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,might have been the vow of those who came forward with the offering.
10915,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"And when it was expected of them to make sacrifices, they not only"
10916,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"would make none, but declared it an act of impiety to expect it. Some"
10917,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"of the people, who feared the Immortals, were dismayed and indignant"
10918,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,at this backwardness; and the discontent at last grew universal.
10919,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Whereupon, the two chief priests held a long conference together, and"
10920,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,agreed that something must be done to pacify the multitude. But it was
10921,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"not until the greater of them, acknowledging his despondency, called"
10922,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,on the gods to answer for him that his grief was only because he never
10923,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"could abide bad precedents: and the other, on his side, protested that"
10924,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"he was overruled by his superior, and moreover had a serious"
10925,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,objection (founded on principle) to be knocked on the head. Meanwhile
10926,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the elder was looking down on the folds of his robe, in deep"
10927,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"melancholy. After long consideration, he sprang upon his feet, pushing"
10928,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"his chair behind him, and said, ""Well, it is grown old, and was always"
10929,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"too long for me: I am resolved to cut off a finger's breadth."""
10930,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10931,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"'""Having, in your wisdom and piety, well contemplated the bad"
10932,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"precedent,"" said the other, with much consternation in his countenance"
10933,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,at seeing so elastic a spring in a heel by no means bearing any
10934,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"resemblance to a stag's.... ""I have, I have,"" replied the other,"
10935,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"interrupting him; ""say no more; I am sick at heart; you must do the"
10936,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"same."""
10937,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10938,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"'""A cursed dog has torn a hole in mine,"" answered the other, ""and, if"
10939,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"I cut anywhere about it, I only make bad worse. In regard to its"
10940,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"length, I wish it were as long again."" ""Brother! brother! never be"
10941,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"worldly-minded,"" said the senior. ""Follow my example: snip off it not"
10942,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"a finger's breadth, half a finger's breadth."""
10943,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10944,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"'""But,"" expostulated the other, ""will that satisfy the gods?"" ""Who"
10945,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"talked about them?"" placidly said the senior. ""It is very unbecoming"
10946,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,to have them always in our mouths: surely there are appointed times
10947,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"for them. Let us be contented with laying the snippings on the altar,"
10948,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and thus showing the people our piety and condescension. They, and the"
10949,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"gods also, will be just as well satisfied, as if we offered up a"
10950,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"buttock of beef, with a bushel of salt and the same quantity of"
10951,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"wheaten flour on it."""
10952,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
10953,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"'""Well, if that will do ... and you know best,"" replied the other, ""so"
10954,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"be it."" Saying which words, he carefully and considerately snipped off"
10955,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,as much in proportion (for he was shorter by an inch) as the elder had
10956,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"done, yet leaving on his shoulders quite enough of materials to make"
10957,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,handsome cloaks for seven or eight stout-built generals. Away they
10958,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"both went, arm-in-arm, and then holding up their skirts a great deal"
10959,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"higher than was necessary, told the gods what they two had been doing"
10960,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,for them and their glory. About the court of the temple the sacred
10961,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"swine were lying in indolent composure: seeing which, the brotherly"
10962,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,twain began to commune with themselves afresh: and the senior said
10963,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"repentantly, ""What fools we have been! The populace will laugh"
10964,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"outright at the curtailment of our vestures, but would gladly have"
10965,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"seen these animals eat daily a quarter less of the lentils."" The words"
10966,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,were spoken so earnestly and emphatically that they were overheard by
10967,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the quadrupeds. Suddenly there was a rising of all the principal ones
10968,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"in the sacred enclosure: and many that were in the streets took up,"
10969,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"each according to his temperament and condition, the gravest or"
10970,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,shrillest tone of reprobation. The thinner and therefore the more
10971,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"desperate of the creatures, pushing their snouts under the curtailed"
10972,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"habiliments of the high priests, assailed them with ridicule and"
10973,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,reproach. For it had pleased the gods to work a miracle in their
10974,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"behoof, and they became as loquacious as those who governed them, and"
10975,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"who were appointed to speak in the high places. ""Let the worst come to"
10976,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the worst, we at least have our tails to our hams,"" said they. ""For"
10977,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"how long?"" whined others, piteously: others incessantly ejaculated"
10978,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"tremendous imprecations: others, more serious and sedate, groaned"
10979,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"inwardly; and, although under their hearts there lay a huge mass of"
10980,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"indigestible sourness ready to rise up against the chief priests, they"
10981,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"ventured no farther than expostulation. ""We shall lose our voices,"""
10982,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"said they, ""if we lose our complement of lentils; and then, most"
10983,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"reverend lords, what will ye do for choristers?"" Finally, one of grand"
10984,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"dimensions, who seemed almost half-human, imposed silence on every"
10985,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"debater. He lay stretched out apart from his brethren, covering with"
10986,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"his side the greater portion of a noble dunghill, and all its verdure"
10987,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,native and imported. He crushed a few measures of peascods to cool his
10988,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,tusks; then turned his pleasurable longitudinal eyes far toward the
10989,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"outer extremities of their sockets, and leered fixedly and"
10990,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"sarcastically at the high priests, showing every tooth in each jaw."
10991,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Other men might have feared them; the high priests envied them, seeing"
10992,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"what order they were in, and what exploits they were capable of. A"
10993,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"great painter, who flourished many olympiads ago, has, in his volume"
10994,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"entitled the _Canon_, defined the line of beauty. It was here in its"
10995,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"perfection: it followed with winning obsequiousness every member, but"
10996,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,delighted more especially to swim along that placid and pliant
10997,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,curvature on which Nature had ranged the implements of mastication.
10998,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Pawing with his cloven hoof, he suddenly changed his countenance from"
10999,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the contemplative to the wrathful. At one effort he rose up to his
11000,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"whole length, breadth, and height: and they who had never seen him in"
11001,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"earnest, nor separate from the common swine of the enclosure, with"
11002,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"which he was in the habit of husking what was thrown to him, could"
11003,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,form no idea what a prodigious beast he was. Terrible were the
11004,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,expressions of choler and comminations which burst forth from his
11005,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,fulminating tusks. Erimanthus would have hidden his puny offspring
11006,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,before them; and Hercules would have paused at the encounter. Thrice
11007,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,he called aloud to the high priests: thrice he swore in their own
11008,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,sacred language that they were a couple of thieves and impostors:
11009,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,thrice he imprecated the worst maledictions on his own head if they
11010,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"had not violated the holiest of their vows, and were not ready even to"
11011,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,sell their gods. A tremor ran throughout the whole body of the united
11012,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,swine; so awful was the adjuration! Even the Gasteres themselves in
11013,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"some sort shuddered, not perhaps altogether at the solemn tone of its"
11014,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,impiety; for they had much experience in these matters. But among them
11015,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"was a Gaster who was calmer than the swearer, and more prudent and"
11016,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"conciliating than those he swore against. Hearing this objurgation, he"
11017,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"went blandly up to the sacred porker, and, lifting the flap of his"
11018,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,right ear between forefinger and thumb with all delicacy and
11019,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"gentleness, thus whispered into it: ""You do not in your heart believe"
11020,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"that any of us are such fools as to sell our gods, at least while we"
11021,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"have such a reserve to fall back upon."""
11022,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11023,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"'""Are we to be devoured?"" cried the noble porker, twitching his ear"
11024,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"indignantly from under the hand of the monitor. ""Hush!"" said he,"
11025,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"laying it again, most soothingly, rather farther from the tusks:"
11026,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"""hush! sweet friend! Devoured? Oh, certainly not: that is to say, not"
11027,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_all_: or, if all, not all at once. Indeed the holy men my brethren"
11028,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"may perhaps be contented with taking a little blood from each of you,"
11029,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"entirely for the advantage of your health and activity, and merely to"
11030,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,compose a few slender black-puddings for the inferior monsters of the
11031,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"temple, who latterly are grown very exacting, and either are, or"
11032,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"pretend to be, hungry after they have eaten a whole handful of acorns,"
11033,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,swallowing I am ashamed to say what a quantity of water to wash them
11034,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"down. We do not grudge them it, as they well know: but they appear to"
11035,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,have forgotten how recently no inconsiderable portion of this bounty
11036,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"has been conferred. If we, as they object to us, eat more, they ought"
11037,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to be aware that it is by no means for our gratification, since we"
11038,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"have abjured it before the gods, but to maintain the dignity of the"
11039,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"priesthood, and to exhibit the beauty and utility of subordination."""
11040,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11041,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,'The noble porker had beaten time with his muscular tail at many of
11042,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"these periods; but again his heart panted visibly, and he could bear"
11043,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,no more.
11044,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11045,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"'""All this for our good! for our activity! for our health! Let us"
11046,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"alone: we have health enough; we want no activity. Let us alone, I say"
11047,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"again, or by the Immortals!..."" ""Peace, my son! Your breath is"
11048,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,valuable: evidently you have but little to spare: and what mortal
11049,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"knows how soon the gods may demand the last of it?"""
11050,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11051,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"'At the beginning of this exhortation, the worthy high priest had"
11052,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,somewhat repressed the ebullient choler of his refractory and
11053,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"pertinacious disciple, by applying his flat soft palm to the"
11054,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,signet-formed extremity of the snout.
11055,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11056,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"'""We are ready to hear complaints at all times,"" added he, ""and to"
11057,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"redress any grievance at our own. But beyond a doubt, if you continue"
11058,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to raise your abominable outcries, some of the people are likely to"
11059,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,hit upon two discoveries: first that your lentils would be sufficient
11060,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,to make daily for every poor family a good wholesome porridge; and
11061,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"secondly, that your flesh, properly cured, might hang up nicely"
11062,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"against the forthcoming bean-season."" Pondering these mighty words,"
11063,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the noble porker kept his eyes fixed upon him for some instants, then"
11064,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"leaned forward dejectedly, then tucked one foot under him, then"
11065,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"another, cautious to descend with dignity. At last he grunted (it must"
11066,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"for ever be ambiguous whether with despondency or with resignation),"
11067,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"pushed his wedgy snout far within the straw subjacent, and sank into"
11068,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,that repose which is granted to the just.'
11069,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11070,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Cousin! there are glimmerings of truth and wisdom in
11071,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"sundry parts of this discourse, not unlike little broken shells"
11072,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,entangled in dark masses of seaweed. But I would rather you had
11073,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,continued to adduce fresh arguments to demonstrate the beneficence of
11074,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the Deity, proving (if you could) that our horses and dogs, faithful"
11075,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"servants and companions to us, and often treated cruelly, may"
11076,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"recognize us hereafter, and we them. We have no authority for any such"
11077,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,belief.
11078,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11079,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ We have authority for thinking and doing whatever is humane.
11080,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Speaking of humanity, it now occurs to me, I have heard a report that"
11081,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,some well-intentioned men of your religion so interpret the words or
11082,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"wishes of its Founder, they would abolish slavery throughout the"
11083,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,empire.
11084,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11085,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Such deductions have been drawn indeed from our Master's
11086,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"doctrine: but the saner part of us receive it metaphorically, and"
11087,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,would only set men free from the bonds of sin. For if domestic slaves
11088,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"were manumitted, we should neither have a dinner dressed nor a bed"
11089,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"made, unless by our own children: and as to labour in the fields, who"
11090,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,would cultivate them in this hot climate? We must import slaves from
11091,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Ethiopia and elsewhere, wheresoever they can be procured: but the"
11092,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"hardship lies not on them; it lies on us, and bears heavily; for we"
11093,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"must first buy them with our money, and then feed them; and not only"
11094,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"must we maintain them while they are hale and hearty and can serve us,"
11095,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,but likewise in sickness and (unless we can sell them for a trifle) in
11096,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"decrepitude. Do not imagine, my cousin, that we are no better than"
11097,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"enthusiasts, visionaries, subverters of order, and ready to roll"
11098,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,society down into one flat surface.
11099,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11100,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I thought you were maligned: I said so.
11101,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11102,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ When the subject was discussed in our congregation, the"
11103,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,meaner part of the people were much in favour of the abolition: but
11104,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the chief priests and ministers absented themselves, and gave no vote"
11105,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"at all, deeming it secular, and saying that in such matters the laws"
11106,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and customs of the country ought to be observed.
11107,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11108,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Several of these chief priests and ministers are robed in
11109,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"purple and fine linen, and fare sumptuously every day."
11110,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11111,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ I have hopes of you now.
11112,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11113,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Why so suddenly?
11114,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11115,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Because you have repeated those blessed words, which are"
11116,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,only to be found in our Scriptures.
11117,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11118,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ There indeed I found them. But I also found in the same
11119,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"volume words of the same speaker, declaring that the rich shall never"
11120,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,see His face in heaven.
11121,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11122,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ He does not always mean what you think He does.
11123,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11124,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ How is this? Did He then direct His discourses to none but
11125,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,men more intelligent than I am?
11126,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11127,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Unless He gave you understanding for the occasion, they"
11128,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,might mislead you.
11129,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11130,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Indeed!
11131,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11132,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Unquestionably. For instance, He tells us to take no heed"
11133,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,of to-morrow: He tells us to share equally all our worldly goods: but
11134,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,we know that we cannot be respected unless we bestow due care on our
11135,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"possessions, and that not only the vulgar but the well-educated esteem"
11136,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,us in proportion to the gifts of fortune.
11137,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11138,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ The eclectic philosophy is most flourishing among you
11139,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Christians. You take whatever suits your appetites, and reject the"
11140,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,rest.
11141,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11142,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ We are not half so rich as the priests of Isis. Give us
11143,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"their possessions; and we will not sit idle as they do, but be able"
11144,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and ready to do incalculable good to our fellow-creatures.
11145,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11146,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I have never seen great possessions excite to great
11147,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"alacrity. Usually they enfeeble the sympathies, and often overlie and"
11148,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,smother them.
11149,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11150,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Our religion is founded less on sympathies than on
11151,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,miracles. Cousin! you smile most when you ought to be most serious.
11152,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11153,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I was smiling at the thought of one whom I would recommend
11154,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to your especial notice, as soon as you disinherit the priests of"
11155,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Isis. He may perhaps be refractory; for he pretends (the knave!) to
11156,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,work miracles.
11157,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11158,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Impostor! who is he?
11159,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11160,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Aulus of Pelusium. Idle and dissolute, he never gained"
11161,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"anything honestly but a scourging, if indeed he ever made, what he"
11162,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"long merited, this acquisition. Unable to run into debt where he was"
11163,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"known, he came over to Alexandria."
11164,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11165,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ I know him: I know him well. Here, of his own accord, he"
11166,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,has betaken himself to a new and regular life.
11167,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11168,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ He will presently wear it out, or make it sit easier on his"
11169,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,shoulders. My metaphor brings me to my story. Having nothing to carry
11170,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"with him beside an empty valise, he resolved on filling it with"
11171,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"something, however worthless, lest, seeing his utter destitution, and"
11172,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"hopeless of payment, a receiver of lodgers should refuse to admit him"
11173,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"into the hostelry. Accordingly, he went to a tailor's, and began to"
11174,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,joke about his poverty. Nothing is more apt to bring people into good
11175,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"humour; for, if they are poor themselves, they enjoy the pleasure of"
11176,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"discovering that others are no better off; and, if not poor, there is"
11177,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the consciousness of superiority.
11178,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11179,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,'The favour I am about to ask of a man so wealthy and so liberal as
11180,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"you are,' said Aulus, 'is extremely small: you can materially serve"
11181,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"me, without the slightest loss, hazard, or inconvenience. In few"
11182,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"words, my valise is empty: and to some ears an empty valise is louder"
11183,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and more discordant than a bagpipe: I cannot say I like the sound of
11184,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,it myself. Give me all the shreds and snippings you can spare me. They
11185,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"will feel like clothes; not exactly so to me and my person, but to"
11186,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"those who are inquisitive, and who may be importunate.'"
11187,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11188,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"The tailor laughed, and distended both arms of Aulus with his"
11189,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,munificence. Soon was the valise well filled and rammed down. Plenty
11190,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,of boys were in readiness to carry it to the boat. Aulus waved them
11191,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"off, looking at some angrily, at others suspiciously. Boarding the"
11192,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"skiff, he lowered his treasure with care and caution, staggering a"
11193,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"little at the weight, and shaking it gently on deck, with his ear"
11194,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"against it: and then, finding all safe and compact, he sat on it; but"
11195,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"as tenderly as a pullet on her first eggs. When he was landed, his"
11196,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"care was even greater, and whoever came near him was warned off with"
11197,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,loud vociferations. Anxiously as the other passengers were invited by
11198,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the innkeepers to give their houses the preference, Aulus was"
11199,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,importuned most: the others were only beset; he was borne off in
11200,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"triumphant captivity. He ordered a bedroom, and carried his valise"
11201,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"with him; he ordered a bath, and carried with him his valise. He"
11202,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"started up from the company at dinner, struck his forehead, and cried"
11203,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"out, 'Where is my valise?' 'We are honest men here,' replied the host."
11204,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"'You have left it, sir, in your chamber: where else indeed should you"
11205,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,leave it?'
11206,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11207,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"'Honesty is seated on your brow,' exclaimed Aulus; 'but there are few"
11208,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,to be trusted in the world we live in. I now believe I can eat.' And
11209,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"he gave a sure token of the belief that was in him, not without a"
11210,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"start now and then and a finger at his ear, as if he heard somebody"
11211,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,walking in the direction of his bedchamber. Now began his first
11212,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"miracle: for now he contrived to pick up, from time to time, a little"
11213,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"money. In the presence of his host and fellow-lodgers, he threw a few"
11214,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"obols, negligently and indifferently, among the beggars. 'These poor"
11215,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"creatures,' said he, 'know a new-comer as well as the gnats do: in one"
11216,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,half-hour I am half ruined by them; and this daily.'
11217,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11218,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Nearly a month had elapsed since his arrival, and no account of board"
11219,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and lodging had been delivered or called for. Suspicion at length
11220,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,arose in the host whether he really was rich. When another man's
11221,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"honesty is doubted, the doubter's is sometimes in jeopardy. The host"
11222,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,was tempted to unsew the valise. To his amazement and horror he found
11223,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"only shreds within it. However, he was determined to be cautious, and"
11224,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to consult his wife, who, although a Christian like Aulus, and much"
11225,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"edified by his discourses, might dissent from him in regard to a"
11226,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"community of goods, at least in her own household, and might defy him"
11227,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,to prove by any authority that the doctrine was meant for innkeepers.
11228,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Aulus, on his return in the evening, found out that his valise had"
11229,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"been opened. He hurried back, threw its contents into the canal, and,"
11230,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"borrowing an old cloak, he tucked it up under his dress, and returned."
11231,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Nobody had seen him enter or come back again, nor was it immediately"
11232,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"that his host or hostess were willing to appear. But, after he had"
11233,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"called them loudly for some time, they entered his apartment: and he"
11234,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,thus addressed the woman:
11235,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11236,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,'O Eucharis! no words are requisite to convince you (firm as you are
11237,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"in the faith) of eternal verities, however mysterious. But your"
11238,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,unhappy husband has betrayed his incredulity in regard to the most
11239,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"awful. If my prayers, offered up in our holy temples all day long,"
11240,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"have been heard, and that they have been heard I feel within me the"
11241,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"blessed certainty, something miraculous has been vouchsafed for the"
11242,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"conversion of this miserable sinner. Until the present hour, the"
11243,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,valise before you was filled with precious relics from the apparel of
11244,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"saints and martyrs, fresh as when on them.' 'True, by Jove!' said the"
11245,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"husband to himself. 'Within the present hour,' continued Aulus, 'they"
11246,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"are united into one raiment, signifying our own union, our own"
11247,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,restoration.'
11248,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11249,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"He drew forth the cloak, and fell on his face. Eucharis fell also, and"
11250,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,kissed the saintly head prostrate before her. The host's eyes were
11251,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"opened, and he bewailed his hardness of heart. Aulus is now occupied"
11252,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"in strengthening his faith, not without an occasional support to the"
11253,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,wife's: all three live together in unity.
11254,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11255,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ And do you make a joke even of this? Will you never cease
11256,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,from the habitude?
11257,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11258,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Too soon. The farther we descend into the vale of years, the"
11259,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"fewer illusions accompany us: we have little inclination, little time,"
11260,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"for jocularity and laughter. Light things are easily detached from us,"
11261,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and we shake off heavier as we can. Instead of levity, we are liable"
11262,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,to moroseness: for always near the grave there are more briers than
11263,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"flowers, unless we plant them ourselves, or our friends supply them."
11264,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11265,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Thinking thus, do you continue to dissemble or to distort"
11266,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the truth? The shreds are become a cable for the faithful. That they
11267,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,were miraculously turned into one entire garment who shall gainsay?
11268,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"How many hath it already clothed with righteousness? Happy men,"
11269,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"casting their doubts away before it! Who knows, O Cousin Lucian, but"
11270,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,on some future day you yourself will invoke the merciful interposition
11271,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,of Aulus!
11272,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11273,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Possibly: for if ever I fall among thieves, nobody is"
11274,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,likelier to be at the head of them.
11275,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11276,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Uncharitable man! how suspicious! how ungenerous! how
11277,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,hardened in unbelief! Reason is a bladder on which you may paddle like
11278,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"a child as you swim in summer waters: but, when the winds rise and the"
11279,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"waves roughen, it slips from under you, and you sink; yes, O Lucian,"
11280,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,you sink into a gulf whence you never can emerge.
11281,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11282,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I deem those the wisest who exert the soonest their own
11283,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"manly strength, now with the stream and now against it, enjoying the"
11284,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"exercise in fine weather, venturing out in foul, if need be, yet"
11285,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"avoiding not only rocks and whirlpools, but also shallows. In such a"
11286,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"light, my cousin, I look on your dispensations. I shut them out as we"
11287,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"shut out winds blowing from the desert; hot, debilitating, oppressive,"
11288,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"laden with impalpable sands and pungent salts, and inflicting an"
11289,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,incurable blindness.
11290,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11291,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Well, Cousin Lucian! I can bear all you say while you are"
11292,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,not witty. Let me bid you farewell in this happy interval.
11293,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11294,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Is it not serious and sad, O my cousin, that what the Deity"
11295,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"hath willed to lie incomprehensible in His mysteries, we should fall"
11296,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"upon with tooth and nail, and ferociously growl over, or ignorantly"
11297,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,dissect?
11298,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11299,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Ho! now you come to be serious and sad, there are hopes"
11300,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,of you. Truth always begins or ends so.
11301,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11302,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Undoubtedly. But I think it more reverential to abstain from
11303,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"that which, with whatever effort, I should never understand."
11304,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11305,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ You are lukewarm, my cousin, you are lukewarm. A most"
11306,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,dangerous state.
11307,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11308,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ For milk to continue in, not for men. I would not fain be"
11309,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,frozen or scalded.
11310,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11311,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Alas! you are blind, my sweet cousin!"
11312,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11313,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Well; do not open my eyes with pincers, nor compose for them"
11314,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,a collyrium of spurge.
11315,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11316,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"May not men eat and drink and talk together, and perform in relation"
11317,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"one to another all the duties of social life, whose opinions are"
11318,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"different on things immediately under their eyes? If they can and do,"
11319,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,surely they may as easily on things equally above the comprehension of
11320,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,each party. The wisest and most virtuous man in the whole extent of
11321,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the Roman Empire is Plutarch of Cheronaea: yet Plutarch holds a firm
11322,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"belief in the existence of I know not how many gods, every one of whom"
11323,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,has committed notorious misdemeanours. The nearest to the Cheronaean
11324,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"in virtue and wisdom is Trajan, who holds all the gods dog-cheap."
11325,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,These two men are friends. If either of them were influenced by your
11326,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"religion, as inculcated and practised by the priesthood, he would be"
11327,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the enemy of the other, and wisdom and virtue would plead for the"
11328,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"delinquent in vain. When your religion had existed, as you tell us,"
11329,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"about a century, Caius Caecilius, of Novum Comum, was proconsul in"
11330,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Bithynia. Trajan, the mildest and most equitable of mankind, desirous"
11331,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to remove from them, as far as might be, the hatred and invectives of"
11332,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"those whose old religion was assailed by them, applied to Caecilius"
11333,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,for information on their behaviour as good citizens. The reply of
11334,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Caecilius was favourable. Had Trajan applied to the most eminent and
11335,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"authoritative of the sect, they would certainly have brought into"
11336,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,jeopardy all who differed in one tittle from any point of their
11337,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,doctrine or discipline. For the thorny and bitter aloe of dissension
11338,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,required less than a century to flower on the steps of your temple.
11339,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11340,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ You are already half a Christian, in exposing to the"
11341,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,world the vanities both of philosophy and of power.
11342,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11343,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I have done no such thing: I have exposed the vanities of
11344,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the philosophizing and the powerful. Philosophy is admirable; and
11345,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Power may be glorious: the one conduces to truth, the other has nearly"
11346,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"all the means of conferring peace and happiness, but it usually, and"
11347,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"indeed almost always, takes a contrary direction. I have ridiculed the"
11348,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"futility of speculative minds, only when they would pave the clouds"
11349,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,instead of the streets. To see distant things better than near is a
11350,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,certain proof of a defective sight. The people I have held in derision
11351,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"never turn their eyes to what they can see, but direct them"
11352,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"continually where nothing is to be seen. And this, by their disciples,"
11353,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,is called the sublimity of speculation! There is little merit
11354,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"acquired, or force exhibited, in blowing off a feather that would"
11355,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,settle on my nose: and this is all I have done in regard to the
11356,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"philosophers: but I claim for myself the approbation of humanity, in"
11357,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,having shown the true dimensions of the great. The highest of them are
11358,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,no higher than my tunic; but they are high enough to trample on the
11359,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,necks of those wretches who throw themselves on the ground before
11360,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,them.
11361,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11362,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Was Alexander of Macedon no higher?
11363,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11364,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ What region of the earth, what city, what theatre, what"
11365,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"library, what private study, hath he enlightened? If you are silent, I"
11366,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,may well be. It is neither my philosophy nor your religion which casts
11367,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the blood and bones of men in their faces, and insists on the most"
11368,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,reverence for those who have made the most unhappy. If the Romans
11369,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,scourged by the hands of children the schoolmaster who would have
11370,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"betrayed them, how greatly more deserving of flagellation, from the"
11371,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"same quarter, are those hundreds of pedagogues who deliver up the"
11372,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,intellects of youth to such immoral revellers and mad murderers! They
11373,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,would punish a thirsty child for purloining a bunch of grapes from a
11374,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"vineyard, and the same men on the same day would insist on his"
11375,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"reverence for the subverter of Tyre, the plunderer of Babylon, and the"
11376,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,incendiary of Persepolis. And are these men teachers? are these men
11377,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,philosophers? are these men priests? Of all the curses that ever
11378,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"afflicted the earth, I think Alexander was the worst. Never was he in"
11379,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,so little mischief as when he was murdering his friends.
11380,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11381,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Yet he built this very city; a noble and opulent one when
11382,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Rome was of hurdles and rushes.
11383,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11384,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ He built it! I wish, O Timotheus! he had been as well"
11385,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"employed as the stone-cutters or the plasterers. No, no: the wisest of"
11386,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"architects planned the most beautiful and commodious of cities, by"
11387,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"which, under a rational government and equitable laws, Africa might"
11388,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"have been civilized to the centre, and the palm have extended her"
11389,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"conquests through the remotest desert. Instead of which, a dozen of"
11390,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Macedonian thieves rifled a dying drunkard and murdered his children.
11391,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"In process of time, another drunkard reeled hitherward from Rome, made"
11392,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"an easy mistake in mistaking a palace for a brothel, permitted a"
11393,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"stripling boy to beat him soundly, and a serpent to receive the last"
11394,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,caresses of his paramour.
11395,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11396,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Shame upon historians and pedagogues for exciting the worst passions
11397,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,of youth by the display of such false glories! If your religion hath
11398,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"any truth or influence, her professors will extinguish the promontory"
11399,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"lights, which only allure to breakers. They will be assiduous in"
11400,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,teaching the young and ardent that great abilities do not constitute
11401,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"great men, without the right and unremitting application of them; and"
11402,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"that, in the sight of Humanity and Wisdom, it is better to erect one"
11403,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,cottage than to demolish a hundred cities. Down to the present day we
11404,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,have been taught little else than falsehood. We have been told to do
11405,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,this thing and that: we have been told we shall be punished unless we
11406,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,do: but at the same time we are shown by the finger that prosperity
11407,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and glory, and the esteem of all about us, rest upon other and very"
11408,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"different foundations. Now, do the ears or the eyes seduce the most"
11409,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,easily and lead the most directly to the heart? But both eyes and ears
11410,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"are won over, and alike are persuaded to corrupt us."
11411,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11412,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Cousin Lucian, I was leaving you with the strangest of"
11413,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,all notions in my head. I began to think for a moment that you doubted
11414,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,my sincerity in the religion I profess; and that a man of your
11415,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"admirable good sense, and at your advanced age, could reject that only"
11416,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,sustenance which supports us through the grave into eternal life.
11417,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11418,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ I am the most docile and practicable of men, and never"
11419,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"reject what people set before me: for if it is bread, it is good for"
11420,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"my own use; if bone or bran, it will do for my dog or mule. But,"
11421,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"although you know my weakness and facility, it is unfair to expect I"
11422,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,should have admitted at once what the followers and personal friends
11423,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,of your Master for a long time hesitated to receive. I remember to
11424,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"have read in one of the early commentators, that His disciples"
11425,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,themselves could not swallow the miracle of the loaves; and one who
11426,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"wrote more recently says, that even His brethren did not believe in"
11427,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Him.
11428,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11429,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Yet, finally, when they have looked over each other's"
11430,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"accounts, they cast them up, and make them all tally in the main sum;"
11431,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and if one omits an article, the next supplies its place with a"
11432,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,commodity of the same value. What would you have? But it is of little
11433,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"use to argue on religion with a man who, professing his readiness to"
11434,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"believe, and even his credulity, yet disbelieves in miracles."
11435,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11436,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I should be obstinate and perverse if I disbelieved in the
11437,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"existence of a thing for no better reason than because I never saw it,"
11438,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and cannot understand its operations. Do you believe, O Timotheus,"
11439,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"that Perictione, the mother of Plato, became his mother by the sole"
11440,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"agency of Apollo's divine spirit, under the phantasm of that god?"
11441,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11442,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ I indeed believe such absurdities?
11443,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11444,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ You touch me on a vital part if you call an absurdity the
11445,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"religion or philosophy in which I was educated. Anaxalides, and"
11446,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Clearagus, and Speusippus, his own nephew, assert it. Who should know"
11447,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,better than they?
11448,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11449,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Where are their proofs?
11450,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11451,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I would not be so indelicate as to require them on such an
11452,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"occasion. A short time ago I conversed with an old centurion, who was"
11453,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"in service by the side of Vespasian, when Titus, and many officers and"
11454,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"soldiers of the army, and many captives, were present, and who saw one"
11455,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Eleazar put a ring to the nostril of a demoniac (as the patient was
11456,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,called) and draw the demon out of it.
11457,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11458,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ And do you pretend to believe this nonsense?
11459,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11460,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I only believe that Vespasian and Titus had nothing to gain
11461,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"or accomplish by the miracle; and that Eleazar, if he had been"
11462,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"detected in a trick by two acute men and several thousand enemies, had"
11463,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,nothing to look forward to but a cross--the only piece of upholstery
11464,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"for which Judea seems to have either wood or workmen, and which are"
11465,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,as common in that country as direction-posts are in any other.
11466,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11467,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ The Jews are a stiff-necked people.
11468,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11469,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ On such occasions, no doubt."
11470,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11471,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Would you, O Lucian, be classed among the atheists, like"
11472,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Epicurus?
11473,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11474,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ It lies not at my discretion what name shall be given me at
11475,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"present or hereafter, any more than it did at my birth. But I wonder"
11476,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,at the ignorance and precipitancy of those who call Epicurus an
11477,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,atheist. He saw on the same earth with himself a great variety of
11478,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"inferior creatures, some possessing more sensibility and more"
11479,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,thoughtfulness than others. Analogy would lead so contemplative a
11480,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"reasoner to the conclusion that if many were inferior and in sight,"
11481,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,others might be superior and out of sight. He never disbelieved in the
11482,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,existence of the gods; he only disbelieved that they troubled their
11483,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,heads with our concerns. Have they none of their own? If they are
11484,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"happy, does their happiness depend on us, comparatively so imbecile"
11485,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and vile? He believed, as nearly all nations do, in different ranks"
11486,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and orders of superhuman beings; and perhaps he thought (but I never
11487,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,was in his confidence or counsels) that the higher were rather in
11488,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"communication with the next to them in intellectual faculties, than"
11489,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,with the most remote. To me the suggestion appears by no means
11490,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"irrational, that if we are managed or cared for at all by beings wiser"
11491,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,than ourselves (which in truth would be no sign of any great wisdom in
11492,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"them), it can only be by such as are very far from perfection, and who"
11493,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"indulge us in the commission of innumerable faults and follies, for"
11494,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,their own speculation or amusement.
11495,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11496,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ There is only one such; and he is the devil.
11497,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11498,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ If he delights in our wickedness, which you believe, he must"
11499,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"be incomparably the happiest of beings, which you do not believe. No"
11500,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,god of Epicurus rests his elbow on his armchair with less energetic
11501,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,exertion or discomposure.
11502,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11503,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ We lead holier and purer lives than such ignorant mortals
11504,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,as are not living under Grace.
11505,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11506,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ I also live under Grace, O Timotheus! and I venerate her for"
11507,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,the pleasures I have received at her hands. I do not believe she has
11508,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"quite deserted me. If my grey hairs are unattractive to her, and if"
11509,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the trace of her fingers is lost in the wrinkles of my forehead, still"
11510,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,I sometimes am told it is discernible even on the latest and coldest
11511,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,of my writings.
11512,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11513,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ You are wilful in misapprehension. The Grace of which I
11514,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,speak is adverse to pleasure and impurity.
11515,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11516,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Rightly do you separate impurity and pleasure, which indeed"
11517,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,soon fly asunder when the improvident would unite them. But never
11518,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"believe that tenderness of heart signifies corruption of morals, if"
11519,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,you happen to find it (which indeed is unlikely) in the direction you
11520,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"have taken; on the contrary, no two qualities are oftener found"
11521,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"together, on mind as on matter, than hardness and lubricity."
11522,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11523,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Believe me, Cousin Timotheus, when we come to eighty years of age we"
11524,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,are all Essenes. In our kingdom of heaven there is no marrying or
11525,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"giving in marriage; and austerity in ourselves, when Nature holds over"
11526,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"us the sharp instrument with which Jupiter operated on Saturn, makes"
11527,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"us austere to others. But how happens it that you, both old and young,"
11528,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,break every bond which connected you anciently with the Essenes? Not
11529,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"only do you marry (a height of wisdom to which I never have attained,"
11530,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"although in others I commend it), but you never share your substance"
11531,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"with the poorest of your community, as they did, nor live simply and"
11532,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"frugally, nor purchase nor employ slaves, nor refuse rank and offices"
11533,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"in the State, nor abstain from litigation, nor abominate and execrate"
11534,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the wounds and cruelties of war. The Essenes did all this, and greatly"
11535,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"more, if Josephus and Philo, whose political and religious tenets are"
11536,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"opposite to theirs, are credible and trustworthy."
11537,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11538,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Doubtless you would also wish us to retire into the
11539,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"desert, and eschew the conversation of mankind."
11540,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11541,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ No, indeed; but I would wish the greater part of your people"
11542,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to eschew mine, for they bring all the worst of the desert with them"
11543,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"whenever they enter; its smothering heats, its blinding sands, its"
11544,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"sweeping suffocation. Return to the pure spirit of the Essenes,"
11545,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"without their asceticism; cease from controversy, and drop party"
11546,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"designations. If you will not do this, do less, and be merely what you"
11547,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"profess to be, which is quite enough for an honest, a virtuous, and a"
11548,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,religious man.
11549,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11550,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Cousin Lucian, I did not come hither to receive a lecture"
11551,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,from you.
11552,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11553,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I have often given a dinner to a friend who did not come to
11554,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,dine with me.
11555,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11556,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Then, I trust, you gave him something better for dinner"
11557,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,than bay-salt and dandelions. If you will not assist us in nettling
11558,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"our enemies a little for their absurdities and impositions, let me"
11559,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"entreat you, however, to let us alone, and to make no remarks on us."
11560,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"I myself run into no extravagances, like the Essenes, washing and"
11561,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"fasting, and retiring into solitude. I am not called to them; when I"
11562,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"am, I go."
11563,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11564,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I am apprehensive the Lord may afflict you with deafness in
11565,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,that ear.
11566,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11567,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Nevertheless, I am indifferent to the world, and all"
11568,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"things in it. This, I trust, you will acknowledge to be true religion"
11569,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and true philosophy.
11570,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11571,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ That is not philosophy which betrays an indifference to
11572,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,those for whose benefit philosophy was designed; and those are the
11573,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,whole human race. But I hold it to be the most unphilosophical thing
11574,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"in the world to call away men from useful occupations and mutual help,"
11575,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to profitless speculations and acrid controversies. Censurable enough,"
11576,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and contemptible, too, is that supercilious philosopher, sneeringly"
11577,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"sedate, who narrates in full and flowing periods the persecutions and"
11578,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"tortures of a fellow-man, led astray by his credulity, and ready to"
11579,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,die in the assertion of what in his soul he believes to be the truth.
11580,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"But hardly less censurable, hardly less contemptible, is the"
11581,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"tranquilly arrogant sectarian, who denies that wisdom or honesty can"
11582,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,exist beyond the limits of his own ill-lighted chamber.
11583,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11584,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ What! is he sanguinary?
11585,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11586,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Whenever he can be, he is; and he always has it in his power"
11587,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to be even worse than that, for he refuses his custom to the"
11588,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,industrious and honest shopkeeper who has been taught to think
11589,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,differently from himself in matters which he has had no leisure to
11590,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"study, and by which, if he had enjoyed that leisure, he would have"
11591,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,been a less industrious and a less expert artificer.
11592,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11593,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ We cannot countenance those hard-hearted men who refuse
11594,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,to hear the word of the Lord.
11595,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11596,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ The hard-hearted knowing this of the tender-hearted, and"
11597,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"receiving the declaration from their own lips, will refuse to hear the"
11598,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,word of the Lord all their lives.
11599,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11600,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Timotheus._ Well, well; it cannot be helped. I see, cousin, my hopes"
11601,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,of obtaining a little of your assistance in your own pleasant way are
11602,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,disappointed; but it is something to have conceived a better hope of
11603,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"saving your soul, from your readiness to acknowledge your belief in"
11604,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,miracles.
11605,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11606,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ Miracles have existed in all ages and in all religions.
11607,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,Witnesses to some of them have been numerous; to others of them fewer.
11608,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"Occasionally, the witnesses have been disinterested in the result."
11609,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11610,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Now indeed you speak truly and wisely.
11611,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11612,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ But sometimes the most honest and the most quiescent have
11613,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,either been unable or unwilling to push themselves so forward as to
11614,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,see clearly and distinctly the whole of the operation; and have
11615,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,listened to some knave who felt a pleasure in deluding their
11616,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"credulity, or some other who himself was either an enthusiast or a"
11617,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"dupe. It also may have happened in the ancient religions, of Egypt for"
11618,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"instance, or of India, or even of Greece, that narratives have been"
11619,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,attributed to authors who never heard of them; and have been
11620,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"circulated by honest men who firmly believed them; by half-honest, who"
11621,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,indulged their vanity in becoming members of a novel and bustling
11622,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"society; and by utterly dishonest, who, having no other means of"
11623,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"rising above the shoulders of the vulgar, threw dust into their eyes"
11624,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and made them stoop.
11625,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11626,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Ha! the rogues! It is nearly all over with them.
11627,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11628,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ Let us hope so. Parthenius and the Roman poet Ovidius Naso,"
11629,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"have related the transformations of sundry men, women, and gods."
11630,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11631,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ Idleness! Idleness! I never read such lying authors.
11632,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11633,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ I myself have seen enough to incline me toward a belief in
11634,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,them.
11635,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11636,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ You? Why! you have always been thought an utter infidel;
11637,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"and now you are running, hot and heedless as any mad dog, to the"
11638,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,opposite extreme!
11639,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11640,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"_Lucian._ I have lived to see, not indeed one man, but certainly one"
11641,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"animal turned into another; nay, great numbers. I have seen sheep with"
11642,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"the most placid faces in the morning, one nibbling the tender herb"
11643,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"with all its dew upon it; another, negligent of its own sustenance,"
11644,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,and giving it copiously to the tottering lamb aside it.
11645,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11646,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Timotheus._ How pretty! half poetical!
11647,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11648,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,_Lucian._ In the heat of the day I saw the very same sheep tearing off
11649,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"each other's fleeces with long teeth and longer claws, and imitating"
11650,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"so admirably the howl of wolves, that at last the wolves came down on"
11651,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"them in a body, and lent their best assistance at the general"
11652,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"devouring. What is more remarkable, the people of the villages seemed"
11653,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"to enjoy the sport; and, instead of attacking the wolves, waited until"
11654,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"they had filled their stomachs, ate the little that was left, said"
11655,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,"piously and from the bottom of their hearts what you call _grace_, and"
11656,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,went home singing and piping.
11657,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11658,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11659,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11660,LUCIAN AND TIMOTHEUS,
11661,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
11662,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11663,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11664,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_Shipley._ There are very few men, even in the bushes and the"
11665,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"wilderness, who delight in the commission of cruelty; but nearly all,"
11666,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"throughout the earth, are censurable for the admission. When we see a"
11667,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"blow struck, we go on and think no more about it: yet every blow aimed"
11668,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"at the most distant of our fellow-creatures, is sure to come back,"
11669,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"some time or other, to our families and descendants. He who lights a"
11670,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"fire in one quarter is ignorant to what other the winds may carry it,"
11671,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,and whether what is kindled in the wood may not break out again in the
11672,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,cornfield.
11673,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11674,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Franklin._ If we could restrain but one generation from deeds of
11675,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"violence, the foundation for a new and a more graceful edifice of"
11676,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"society would not only have been laid, but would have been"
11677,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,consolidated.
11678,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11679,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Shipley._ We already are horrified at the bare mention of religious
11680,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,wars; we should then be horrified at the mention of political. Why
11681,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"should they who, when they are affronted or offended, abstain from"
11682,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"inflicting blows, some from a sense of decorousness and others from a"
11683,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"sense of religion, be forward to instigate the infliction of ten"
11684,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"thousand, all irremediable, all murderous? Every chief magistrate"
11685,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"should be arbitrator and umpire in all differences between any two,"
11686,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,forbidding war. Much would be added to the dignity of the most
11687,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,powerful king by rendering him an efficient member of such a grand
11688,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,Amphictyonic council. Unhappily they are persuaded in childhood that a
11689,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,reign is made glorious by a successful war. What schoolmaster ever
11690,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,taught a boy to question it? or indeed any point of political
11691,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"morality, or any incredible thing in history? Caesar and Alexander are"
11692,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,uniformly clement: Themistocles died by a draught of bull's blood:
11693,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,Portia by swallowing red-hot pieces of charcoal.
11694,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11695,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Franklin._ Certainly no woman or man could perform either of these
11696,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,feats. In my opinion it lies beyond a doubt that Portia suffocated
11697,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"herself by the fumes of charcoal; and that the Athenian, whose stomach"
11698,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"must have been formed on the model of other stomachs, and must"
11699,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,therefore have rejected a much less quantity of blood than would have
11700,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"poisoned him, died by some chemical preparation, of which a bull's"
11701,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"blood might, or might not, have been part. Schoolmasters who thus"
11702,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"betray their trust, ought to be scourged by their scholars, like him"
11703,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,of their profession who underwent the just indignation of the Roman
11704,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,Consul. You shut up those who are infected with the plague; why do you
11705,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,lay no coercion on those who are incurably possessed by the legion
11706,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,devil of carnage? When a creature is of intellect so perverted that he
11707,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"can discern no difference between a review and a battle, between the"
11708,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"animating bugle and the dying groan, it were expedient to remove him,"
11709,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"as quietly as may be, from his devastation of God's earth and his"
11710,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,usurpation of God's authority. Compassion points out the cell for him
11711,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"at the bottom of the hospital, and listens to hear the key turned in"
11712,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,the ward: until then the house is insecure.
11713,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11714,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_Shipley._ God grant our rulers wisdom, and our brethren peace!"
11715,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11716,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Franklin._ Here are but indifferent specimens and tokens. Those
11717,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"fellows throw stones pretty well: if they practise much longer, they"
11718,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"will hit us: let me entreat you, my lord, to leave me here. So long as"
11719,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"the good people were contented with hooting and shouting at us, no"
11720,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,great harm was either done or apprehended: but now they are beginning
11721,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"to throw stones, perhaps they may prove themselves more dexterous in"
11722,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,action than their rulers have done latterly in council.
11723,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11724,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_Shipley._ Take care, Doctor Franklin! _That_ was very near being the"
11725,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,philosopher's stone.
11726,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11727,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_Franklin._ Let me pick it up, then, and send it to London by the"
11728,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"diligence. But I am afraid your ministers, and the nation at large,"
11729,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"are as little in the way of wealth as of wisdom, in the experiment"
11730,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,they are making.
11731,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11732,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_Shipley._ While I was attending to you, William had started. Look! he"
11733,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"has reached them: they are listening to him. Believe me, he has all"
11734,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"the courage of an Englishman and of a Christian; and, if the stoutest"
11735,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"of them force him to throw off his new black coat, the blusterer would"
11736,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,soon think it better to have listened to less polemical doctrine.
11737,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11738,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_Franklin._ Meantime a few of the town boys are come nearer, and begin"
11739,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,to grow troublesome. I am sorry to requite your hospitality with such
11740,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,hard fare.
11741,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11742,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_Shipley._ True, these young bakers make their bread very gritty, but"
11743,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,we must partake of it together so long as you are with us.
11744,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11745,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_Franklin._ Be pleased, my lord, to give us grace; our repast is over;"
11746,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,this is my boat.
11747,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11748,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Shipley._ We will accompany you as far as to the ship. Thank God! we
11749,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"are now upon the water, and all safe. Give me your hand, my good"
11750,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,Doctor Franklin! and although you have failed in the object of your
11751,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"mission, yet the intention will authorize me to say, in the holy words"
11752,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"of our Divine Redeemer, Blessed are the peacemakers!"
11753,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11754,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Franklin._ My dear lord! if God ever blessed a man at the
11755,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"intercession of another, I may reasonably and confidently hope in such"
11756,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"a benediction. Never did one arise from a warmer, a tenderer, or a"
11757,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,purer heart.
11758,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11759,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Shipley._ Infatuation! that England should sacrifice to her king so
11760,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"many thousands of her bravest men, and ruin so many thousands of her"
11761,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"most industrious, in a vain attempt to destroy the very principles on"
11762,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,which her strength and her glory are founded! The weakest prince that
11763,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"ever sat upon a throne, and the most needy and sordid Parliament that"
11764,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"ever pandered to distempered power, are thrusting our blindfold nation"
11765,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,from the pinnacle of prosperity.
11766,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11767,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Franklin._ I believe _your_ king (from this moment it is permitted me
11768,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,to call him _ours_ no longer) to be as honest and as wise a man as any
11769,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,of those about him: but unhappily he can see no difference between a
11770,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,review and a battle. Such are the optics of most kings and rulers. His
11771,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"Parliament, in both Houses, acts upon calculation. There is hardly a"
11772,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"family, in either, that does not anticipate the clear profit of"
11773,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"several thousands a year, to itself and its connexions. Appointments"
11774,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,to regiments and frigates raise the price of papers; and forfeited
11775,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"estates fly confusedly about, and darken the air from the Thames to"
11776,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,the Atlantic.
11777,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11778,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_Shipley._ It is lamentable to think that war, bringing with it every"
11779,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"species of human misery, should become a commercial speculation. Bad"
11780,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,enough when it arises from revenge; another word for honour.
11781,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11782,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Franklin._ A strange one indeed! but not more strange than fifty
11783,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,others that come under the same title. Wherever there is nothing of
11784,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"religion, nothing of reason, nothing of truth, we come at once to"
11785,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"honour; and here we draw the sword, dispense with what little of"
11786,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"civilization we ever pretended to, and murder or get murdered, as may"
11787,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,happen. But these ceremonials both begin and end with an appeal to
11788,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"God, who, before we appealed to Him, plainly told us we should do no"
11789,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"such thing, and that He would punish us most severely if we did. And"
11790,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"yet, my lord, even the gentlemen upon your bench turn a deaf ear to"
11791,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"Him on these occasions: nay, they go further; they pray to Him for"
11792,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"success in that which He has forbidden so strictly, and when they have"
11793,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"broken His commandment, thank Him. Upon seeing these mockeries and"
11794,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"impieties age after age repeated, I have asked myself whether the"
11795,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,depositaries and expounders of religion have really any whatever of
11796,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"their own; or rather, like the lawyers, whether they do not defend"
11797,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,professionally a cause that otherwise does not interest them in the
11798,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"least. Surely, if these holy men really believed in a just retributive"
11799,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"God, they would never dare to utter the word _war_, without horror and"
11800,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,deprecation.
11801,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11802,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Shipley._ Let us attribute to infirmity what we must else attribute
11803,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,to wickedness.
11804,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11805,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Franklin._ Willingly would I: but children are whipped severely for
11806,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"inobservance of things less evident, for disobedience of commands less"
11807,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,audible and less awful. I am loath to attribute cruelty to your order:
11808,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,men so entirely at their ease have seldom any. Certain I am that
11809,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,several of the bishops would not have patted Cain upon the back while
11810,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,he was about to kill Abel; and my wonder is that the very same holy
11811,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,men encourage their brothers in England to kill their brothers in
11812,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"America; not one, not two nor three, but thousands, many thousands."
11813,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11814,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Shipley._ I am grieved at the blindness with which God has afflicted
11815,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,us for our sins. These unhappy men are little aware what combustibles
11816,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"they are storing under the Church, and how soon they may explode. Even"
11817,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,the wisest do not reflect on the most important and the most certain
11818,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"of things; which is, that every act of inhumanity and injustice goes"
11819,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"far beyond what is apparent at the time of its commission; that these,"
11820,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"and all other things, have their consequences; and that the"
11821,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,consequences are infinite and eternal. If this one truth alone could
11822,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"be deeply impressed upon the hearts of men, it would regenerate the"
11823,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,whole human race.
11824,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11825,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_Franklin._ In regard to politics, I am not quite certain whether a"
11826,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"politician may not be too far-sighted: but I am quite certain that, if"
11827,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"it be a fault, it is one into which few have fallen. The policy of the"
11828,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"Romans in the time of the republic, seems to have been prospective."
11829,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"Some of the Dutch also, and of the Venetians, used the telescope. But"
11830,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"in monarchies the prince, not the people, is consulted by the minister"
11831,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,of the day; and what pleases the weakest supersedes what is approved
11832,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,by the wisest.
11833,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11834,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_Shipley._ We have had great statesmen: Burleigh, Cromwell,"
11835,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"Marlborough, Somers: and whatever may have been in the eyes of a"
11836,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"moralist the vices of Walpole, none ever understood more perfectly, or"
11837,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"pursued more steadily, the direct and palpable interests of the"
11838,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"country. Since his administration, our affairs have never been managed"
11839,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,by men of business; and it was more than could have been expected
11840,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"that, in our war against the French in Canada, the appointment fell on"
11841,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,an able commander.
11842,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11843,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Franklin._ Such an anomaly is unlikely to recur. You have in the
11844,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,English Parliament (I speak of both Houses) only two great men; only
11845,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,two considerate and clear-sighted politicians; Chatham and Burke.
11846,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,Three or four can say clever things; several have sonorous voices;
11847,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,many vibrate sharp comminations from the embrasures of portentously
11848,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,slit sleeves; and there are those to be found who deliver their
11849,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"oracles out of wigs as worshipful as the curls of Jupiter, however"
11850,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,they may be grumbled at by the flour-mills they have laid under such
11851,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,heavy contribution; yet nearly all of all parties want alike the
11852,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,sagacity to discover that in striking America you shake Europe; that
11853,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,kings will come out of the war either to be victims or to be despots;
11854,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,and that within a quarter of a century they will be hunted down like
11855,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"vermin by the most servile nations, or slain in their palaces by their"
11856,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,own courtiers. In a peace of twenty years you might have paid off the
11857,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"greater part of your National Debt, indeed as much of it as it would"
11858,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"be expedient to discharge, and you would have left your old enemy"
11859,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,France labouring and writhing under the intolerable and increasing
11860,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,weight of hers. This is the only way in which you can ever quite
11861,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"subdue her; and in this you subdue her without a blow, without a"
11862,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"menace, and without a wrong. As matters now stand, you are calling her"
11863,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"from attending to the corruptions of her court, and inviting her from"
11864,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,bankruptcy to glory.
11865,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11866,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Shipley._ I see not how bankruptcy can be averted by the expenditure
11867,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,of war.
11868,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11869,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_Franklin._ It cannot. But war and glory are the same thing to France,"
11870,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,and she sings as shrilly and as gaily after a beating as before. With
11871,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,a subsidy to a less amount than she has lately been accustomed to
11872,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"squander in six weeks, and with no more troops than would garrison a"
11873,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"single fortress, she will enable us to set you at defiance, and to do"
11874,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,you a heavier injury in two campaigns than she has been able to do in
11875,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"two centuries, although your king was in her pay against you. She will"
11876,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"instantly be our ally, and soon our scholar. Afterward she will sell"
11877,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"her crown jewels and her church jewels, which cover the whole kingdom,"
11878,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,and will derive unnatural strength from her vices and her profligacy.
11879,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"You ought to have conciliated us as your ally, and to have had no"
11880,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"other, excepting Holland and Denmark. England could never have, unless"
11881,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"by her own folly, more than one enemy. Only one is near enough to"
11882,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,strike her; and that one is down. All her wars for six hundred years
11883,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,have not done this; and the first trumpet will untrance her. You leave
11884,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,your house open to incendiaries while you are running after a
11885,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"refractory child. Had you laid down the rod, the child would have come"
11886,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"back. And because he runs away from the rod, you take up the poker."
11887,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"Seriously, what means do you possess of enforcing your unjust claims"
11888,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,and insolent authority? Never since the Norman Conquest had you an
11889,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"army so utterly inefficient, or generals so notoriously unskilful: no,"
11890,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"not even in the reign of that venal traitor, that French stipendiary,"
11891,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,the second Charles. Those were yet living who had fought bravely for
11892,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"his father, and those also who had vanquished him: and Victory still"
11893,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,hovered over the mast that had borne the banners of our Commonwealth:
11894,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_ours_, _ours_, my lord! the word is the right word here."
11895,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11896,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_Shipley._ I am depressed in spirit, and can sympathize but little in"
11897,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,your exultation. All the crimes of Nero and Caligula are less
11898,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"afflicting to humanity, and consequently we may suppose will bring"
11899,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"down on the offenders a less severe retribution, than an unnecessary"
11900,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,and unjust war. And yet the authors and abettors of this most grievous
11901,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"among our earthly calamities, the enactors and applauders (on how vast"
11902,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"a theatre!) of the first and greatest crime committed upon earth, are"
11903,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"quiet complacent creatures, jovial at dinner, hearty at breakfast, and"
11904,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"refreshed with sleep! Nay, the prime movers in it are called most"
11905,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,religious and most gracious; and the hand that signs in cold blood the
11906,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"death-warrant of nations, is kissed by the kind-hearted, and confers"
11907,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,distinction upon the brave! The prolongation of a life that shortens
11908,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"so many others, is prayed for by the conscientious and the pious!"
11909,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,Learning is inquisitive in the research of phrases to celebrate him
11910,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"who has conferred such blessings, and the eagle of genius holds the"
11911,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"thunderbolt by his throne! Philosophy, O my friend, has hitherto done"
11912,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,little for the social state; and Religion has nearly all her work to
11913,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"do! She too hath but recently washed her hands from blood, and stands"
11914,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"neutrally by, yes, worse than neutrally, while others shed it. I am"
11915,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,convinced that no day of my life will be so censured by my own
11916,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"clergy, as this, the day on which the last hopes of peace have"
11917,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"abandoned us, and the only true minister of it is pelted from our"
11918,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"shores. Farewell, until better times! may the next generation be"
11919,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"wiser! and wiser it surely will be, for the lessons of Calamity are"
11920,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,far more impressive than those which repudiated Wisdom would have
11921,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,taught.
11922,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11923,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,_Franklin._ Folly hath often the same results as Wisdom: but Wisdom
11924,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,would not engage in her schoolroom so expensive an assistant as
11925,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"Calamity. There are, however, some noisy and unruly children whom she"
11926,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,alone has the method of rendering tame and tractable: perhaps it may
11927,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,be by setting them to their tasks both sore and supperless. The ship
11928,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"is getting under weigh. Adieu once more, my most reverend and noble"
11929,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"friend! Before me in imagination do I see America, beautiful as Leda"
11930,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"in her infant smiles, when her father Jove first raised her from the"
11931,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"earth; and behind me I leave England, hollow, unsubstantial, and"
11932,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"broken, as the shell she burst from."
11933,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11934,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"_Shipley._ O worst of miseries, when it is impiety to pray that our"
11935,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,country may be successful. Farewell! may every good attend you! with
11936,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,"as little of evil to endure or to inflict, as national sins can expect"
11937,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,from the Almighty.
11938,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11939,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11940,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11941,BISHOP SHIPLEY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN,
11942,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR
11943,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
11944,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
11945,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Southey._ Of all the beautiful scenery round King's Weston the view
11946,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"from this terrace, and especially from this sundial, is the"
11947,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,pleasantest.
11948,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
11949,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"_Landor._ The last time I ever walked hither in company (which, unless"
11950,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"with ladies, I rarely have done anywhere) was with a just, a valiant,"
11951,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"and a memorable man, Admiral Nichols, who usually spent his summer"
11952,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"months at the village of Shirehampton, just below us. There, whether"
11953,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"in the morning or evening, it was seldom I found him otherwise engaged"
11954,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,than in cultivating his flowers.
11955,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
11956,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Southey._ I never had the same dislike to company in my walks and
11957,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"rambles as you profess to have, but of which I perceived no sign"
11958,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"whatever when I visited you, first at Llanthony Abbey and afterward"
11959,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,on the Lake of Como. Well do I remember our long conversations in the
11960,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,silent and solitary church of Sant' Abondio (surely the coolest spot
11961,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"in Italy), and how often I turned back my head toward the open door,"
11962,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"fearing lest some pious passer-by, or some more distant one in the"
11963,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"wood above, pursuing the pathway that leads to the tower of Luitprand,"
11964,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"should hear the roof echo with your laughter, at the stories you had"
11965,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,collected about the brotherhood and sisterhood of the place.
11966,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
11967,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"_Landor._ I have forgotten most of them, and nearly all: but I have"
11968,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,not forgotten how we speculated on the possibility that Milton might
11969,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"once have been sitting on the very bench we then occupied, although we"
11970,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,do not hear of his having visited that part of the country. Presently
11971,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,we discoursed on his poetry; as we propose to do again this morning.
11972,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
11973,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"_Southey._ In that case, it seems we must continue to be seated on the"
11974,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,turf.
11975,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
11976,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Landor._ Why so?
11977,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
11978,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Southey._ Because you do not like to walk in company: it might
11979,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,disturb and discompose you: and we never lose our temper without
11980,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"losing at the same time many of our thoughts, which are loath to come"
11981,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,forward without it.
11982,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
11983,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Landor._ From my earliest days I have avoided society as much as I
11984,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"could decorously, for I received more pleasure in the cultivation and"
11985,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,improvement of my own thoughts than in walking up and down among the
11986,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"thoughts of others. Yet, as you know, I never have avoided the"
11987,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"intercourse of men distinguished by virtue and genius; of genius,"
11988,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,because it warmed and invigorated me by my trying to keep pace with
11989,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"it; of virtue, that if I had any of my own it might be called forth by"
11990,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,such vicinity. Among all men elevated in station who have made a noise
11991,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,in the world (admirable old expression!) I never saw any in whose
11992,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"presence I felt inferiority, excepting Kosciusco. But how many in the"
11993,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,lower paths of life have exerted both virtues and abilities which I
11994,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"never exerted, and never possessed! what strength and courage and"
11995,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"perseverance in some, in others what endurance and forbearance! At the"
11996,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"very moment when most, beside yourself, catching up half my words,"
11997,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,would call and employ against me in its ordinary signification what
11998,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"ought to convey the most honorific, the term _self-sufficiency_, I bow"
11999,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"my head before the humble, with greatly more than their humiliation."
12000,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"You are better tempered than I am, and are readier to converse. There"
12001,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"are half-hours when, although in good humour and good spirits, I"
12002,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"would, not be disturbed by the necessity of talking, to be the"
12003,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,possessor of all the rich marshes we see yonder. In this interval
12004,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"there is neither storm nor sunshine of the mind, but calm and (as the"
12005,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"farmer would call it) _growing_ weather, in which the blades of"
12006,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"thought spring up and dilate insensibly. Whatever I do, I must do in"
12007,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"the open air, or in the silence of night: either is sufficient: but I"
12008,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"prefer the hours of exercise, or, what is next to exercise, of"
12009,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,field-repose. Did you happen to know the admiral?
12010,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12011,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Southey._ Not personally: but I believe the terms you have applied to
12012,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"him are well merited. After some experience, he contended that public"
12013,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"men, public women, and the public press, may be all designated by one"
12014,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,and the same trisyllable. He is reported to have been a strict
12015,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"disciplinarian. In the mutiny at the Nore he was seized by his crew,"
12016,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,and summarily condemned by them to be hanged. Many taunting questions
12017,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"were asked him, to which he made no reply. When the rope was fastened"
12018,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"round his neck, the ringleader cried, 'Answer this one thing, however,"
12019,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"before you go, sir! What would you do with any of us, if we were in"
12020,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"your power as you are now in ours?' The admiral, then captain, looked"
12021,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"sternly and contemptuously, and replied, 'Hang you, by God!' Enraged"
12022,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"at this answer, the mutineer tugged at the rope: but another on the"
12023,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"instant rushed forward, exclaiming, 'No, captain!' (for thus he called"
12024,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"the fellow) 'he has been cruel to us, flogging here and flogging"
12025,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"there, but before so brave a man is hanged like a dog, you heave me"
12026,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,overboard.' Others among the most violent now interceded: and an old
12027,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"seaman, not saying a single word, came forward with his knife in his"
12028,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"hand, and cut the noose asunder. Nichols did not thank him, nor notice"
12029,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"him, nor speak: but, looking round at the other ships, in which there"
12030,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"was the like insubordination, he went toward his cabin slow and"
12031,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"silent. Finding it locked, he called to a midshipman: 'Tell that man"
12032,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,with a knife to come down and open the door.' After a pause of a few
12033,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"minutes, it was done: but he was confined below until the quelling of"
12034,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,the mutiny.
12035,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12036,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Landor._ His conduct as Controller of the Navy was no less
12037,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,magnanimous and decisive. In this office he presided at the trial of
12038,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"Lord Melville. His lordship was guilty, we know, of all the charges"
12039,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"brought against him; but, having more patronage than ever minister had"
12040,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"before, he refused to answer the questions which (to repeat his own"
12041,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,expression) might incriminate him. And his refusal was given with a
12042,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"smile of indifference, a consciousness of security. In those days, as"
12043,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"indeed in most others, the main use of power was promotion and"
12044,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,protection: and _honest man_ was never in any age among the titles of
12045,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"nobility, and has always been the appellation used toward the feeble"
12046,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"and inferior by the prosperous. Nichols said on the present occasion,"
12047,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"'If this man is permitted to skulk away under such pretences, trial is"
12048,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"here a mockery.' Finding no support, he threw up his office as"
12049,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"Controller of the Navy, and never afterward entered the House of"
12050,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"Commons. Such a person, it appears to me, leads us aptly and"
12051,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,becomingly to that steadfast patriot on whose writings you promised me
12052,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"your opinion; not incidentally, as before, but turning page after"
12053,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,page. It would ill beseem us to treat Milton with generalities.
12054,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,Radishes and salt are the picnic quota of slim spruce reviewers: let
12055,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,us hope to find somewhat more solid and of better taste. Desirous to
12056,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"be a listener and a learner when you discourse on his poetry, I have"
12057,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,been more occupied of late in examining the prose.
12058,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12059,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Southey._ Do you retain your high opinion of it?
12060,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12061,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Landor._ Experience makes us more sensible of faults than of
12062,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"beauties. Milton is more correct than Addison, but less correct than"
12063,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"Hooker, whom I wish he had been contented to receive as a model in"
12064,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"style, rather than authors who wrote in another and a poorer language;"
12065,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"such, I think, you are ready to acknowledge is the Latin."
12066,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12067,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Southey._ This was always my opinion.
12068,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12069,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"_Landor._ However, I do not complain that in oratory and history his"
12070,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,diction is sometimes poetical.
12071,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12072,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Southey._ Little do I approve of it in prose on any subject.
12073,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"Demosthenes and Aeschines, Lisias and Isaeus, and finally Cicero,"
12074,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,avoided it.
12075,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12076,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Landor._ They did: but Chatham and Burke and Grattan did not; nor
12077,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,indeed the graver and greater Pericles; of whom the most memorable
12078,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,sentence on record is pure poetry. On the fall of the young Athenians
12079,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"in the field of battle, he said, 'The year hath lost its spring.' But"
12080,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"how little are these men, even Pericles himself, if you compare them"
12081,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"as men of genius with Livy! In Livy, as in Milton, there are bursts of"
12082,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"passion which cannot by the nature of things be other than poetical,"
12083,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,nor (being so) come forth in other language. If Milton had executed
12084,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"his design of writing a history of England, it would probably have"
12085,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"abounded in such diction, especially in the more turbulent scenes and"
12086,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,in the darker ages.
12087,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12088,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Southey._ There are quiet hours and places in which a taper may be
12089,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"carried steadily, and show the way along the ground; but you must"
12090,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"stand a-tiptoe and raise a blazing torch above your head, if you would"
12091,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,bring to our vision the obscure and time-worn figures depicted on the
12092,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,lofty vaults of antiquity. The philosopher shows everything in one
12093,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"clear light; the historian loves strong reflections and deep shadows,"
12094,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"but, above all, prominent and moving characters. We are little pleased"
12095,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"with the man who disenchants us: but whoever can make us wonder, must"
12096,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"himself (we think) be wonderful, and deserve our admiration."
12097,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12098,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"_Landor._ Believing no longer in magic and its charms, we still"
12099,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"shudder at the story told by Tacitus, of those which were discovered"
12100,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,in the mournful house of Germanicus.
12101,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12102,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"_Southey._ Tacitus was also a great poet, and would have been a"
12103,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"greater, had he been more contented with the external and ordinary"
12104,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"appearances of things. Instead of which, he looked at a part of his"
12105,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"pictures through a prism, and at another part through a _camera"
12106,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,obscura_. If the historian were as profuse of moral as of political
12107,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"axioms, we should tolerate him less: for in the political we fancy a"
12108,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,writer is but meditating; in the moral we regard him as declaiming. In
12109,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"history we desire to be conversant with only the great, according to"
12110,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"our notions of greatness: we take it as an affront, on such an"
12111,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"invitation, to be conducted into the lecture-room, or to be desired to"
12112,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,amuse ourselves in the study.
12113,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12114,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Landor._ Pray go on. I am desirous of hearing more.
12115,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12116,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"_Southey._ Being now alone, with the whole day before us, and having"
12117,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"carried, as we agreed at breakfast, each his Milton in his pocket, let"
12118,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"us collect all the graver faults we can lay our hands upon, without a"
12119,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"too minute and troublesome research; not in the spirit of Johnson, but"
12120,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,in our own.
12121,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12122,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"_Landor._ That is, abasing our eyes in reverence to so great a man,"
12123,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,but without closing them. The beauties of his poetry we may omit to
12124,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"notice, if we can: but where the crowd claps the hands, it will be"
12125,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"difficult for us always to refrain. Johnson, I think, has been charged"
12126,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,unjustly with expressing too freely and inconsiderately the blemishes
12127,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,of Milton. There are many more of them than he has noticed.
12128,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12129,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"_Southey._ If we add any to the number, and the literary world hears"
12130,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"of it, we shall raise an outcry from hundreds who never could see"
12131,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"either his excellences or his defects, and from several who never have"
12132,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,perused the noblest of his writings.
12133,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12134,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"_Landor._ It may be boyish and mischievous, but I acknowledge I have"
12135,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"sometimes felt a pleasure in irritating, by the cast of a pebble,"
12136,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,those who stretch forward to the full extent of the chain their open
12137,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,and frothy mouths against me. I shall seize upon this conjecture of
12138,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"yours, and say everything that comes into my head on the subject."
12139,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"Beside which, if any collateral thoughts should spring up, I may throw"
12140,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,them in also; as you perceive I have frequently done in my _Imaginary
12141,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"Conversations_, and as we always do in real ones."
12142,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12143,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"_Southey._ When we adhere to one point, whatever the form, it should"
12144,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,rather be called a disquisition than a conversation. Most writers of
12145,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"dialogue take but a single stride into questions the most abstruse,"
12146,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,and collect a heap of arguments to be blown away by the bloated whiffs
12147,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"of some rhetorical charlatan, tricked out in a multiplicity of ribbons"
12148,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,for the occasion.
12149,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12150,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"Before we open the volume of poetry, let me confess to you I admire"
12151,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,his prose less than you do.
12152,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12153,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Landor._ Probably because you dissent more widely from the opinions
12154,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,it conveys: for those who are displeased with anything are unable to
12155,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,confine the displeasure to one spot. We dislike everything a little
12156,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,when we dislike anything much. It must indeed be admitted that his
12157,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,prose is often too latinized and stiff. But I prefer his heavy cut
12158,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"velvet, with its ill-placed Roman fibula, to the spangled gauze and"
12159,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,gummed-on flowers and puffy flounces of our present street-walking
12160,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"literature. So do you, I am certain."
12161,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12162,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"_Southey._ Incomparably. But let those who have gone astray, keep"
12163,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"astray, rather than bring Milton into disrepute by pushing themselves"
12164,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,into his company and imitating his manner. Milton is none of these:
12165,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"and his language is never a patchwork. We find daily, in almost every"
12166,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"book we open, expressions which are not English, never were, and never"
12167,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,will be: for the writers are by no means of sufficiently high rank to
12168,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"be masters of the mint. To arrive at this distinction, it is not"
12169,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"enough to scatter in all directions bold, hazardous, undisciplined"
12170,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"thoughts: there must be lordly and commanding ones, with a full"
12171,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,establishment of well-appointed expressions adequate to their
12172,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,maintenance.
12173,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12174,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"Occasionally I have been dissatisfied with Milton, because in my"
12175,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,opinion that is ill said in prose which can be said more plainly. Not
12176,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"so in poetry: if it were, much of Pindar and Aeschylus, and no little"
12177,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"of Dante, would be censurable."
12178,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12179,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,_Landor._ Acknowledge that he whose poetry I am holding in my hand is
12180,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"free from every false ornament in his prose, unless a few bosses of"
12181,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,latinity may be called so; and I am ready to admit the full claims of
12182,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"your favourite South. Acknowledge that, heading all the forces of our"
12183,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"language, he was the great antagonist of every great monster which"
12184,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,infested our country; and he disdained to trim his lion-skin with
12185,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"lace. No other English writer has equalled Raleigh, Hooker, and"
12186,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"Milton, in the loftier parts of their works."
12187,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12188,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"_Southey._ But Hooker and Milton, you allow, are sometimes pedantic."
12189,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,In Hooker there is nothing so elevated as there is in Raleigh.
12190,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,
12191,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"_Landor._ Neither he, however, nor any modern, nor any ancient, has"
12192,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,attained to that summit on which the sacred ark of Milton strikes and
12193,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"rests. Reflections, such as we indulged in on the borders of the"
12194,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"Larius, come over me here again. Perhaps from the very sod where you"
12195,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"are sitting, the poet in his youth sate looking at the Sabrina he was"
12196,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,soon to celebrate. There is pleasure in the sight of a glebe which
12197,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,never has been broken; but it delights me particularly in those places
12198,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,where great men have been before. I do not mean warriors: for
12199,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,extremely few among the most remarkable of them will a considerate man
12200,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"call great: but poets and philosophers and philanthropists, the"
12201,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"ornaments of society, the charmers of solitude, the warders of"
12202,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"civilization, the watchmen at the gate which Tyranny would batter"
12203,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"down, and the healers of those wounds which she left festering in the"
12204,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"field. And now, to reduce this demon into its proper toad-shape again,"
12205,SOUTHEY AND LANDOR,"and to lose sight of it, open your _Paradise Lost_."

12214,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12215,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"On the morrow I was received at the folding-doors by Pru-Tsi, and"
12216,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"ushered by him into the presence of his majesty the Emperor, who was"
12217,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,graciously pleased to inform me that he had rendered thanks to
12218,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"Almighty God for enlightening his mind, and for placing his empire far"
12219,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"beyond the influence of the persecutor and fanatic. 'But,' continued"
12220,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"his majesty, 'this story of the sorcerer's man quite confounds me."
12221,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,Little as the progress is which the Europeans seem to have made in the
12222,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"path of humanity, yet the English, we know, are less cruel than their"
12223,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"neighbours, and more given to reflection and meditation. How then is"
12224,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,it possible they should allow any portion of their fellow-citizens to
12225,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"be hoodwinked, gagged, and carried away into darkness, by such"
12226,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,conspirators and assassins? Why didst thou not question the man
12227,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,thyself?'
12228,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12229,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"_Tsing-Ti._ I did, O Emperor! and his reply was, 'We can bury such"
12230,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,only as were in the household of the faith. It would be a mockery to
12231,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,bid those spirits go in peace which we know are condemned to
12232,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,everlasting fire.'
12233,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12234,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,_Emperor._ Amazing! have they that? Who invented it? Everlasting fire!
12235,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,It surely might be applied to better purposes. And have those rogues
12236,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,authority to throw people into it? In what part of the kingdom is it?
12237,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"If natural, it ought to have been marked more plainly in the maps. The"
12238,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"English, no doubt, are ashamed of letting it be known abroad that they"
12239,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"have any such places in their country. If artificial, it is no wonder"
12240,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"they keep such a secret to themselves. Tsing-Ti, I commend thy"
12241,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,prudence in asking no questions about it; for I see we are equally at
12242,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,a loss on this curiosity.
12243,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12244,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,_Tsing-Ti._ The sorcerer has a secret for diluting it. Oysters and the
12245,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"white of eggs, applied on lucky days, enter into the composition; but"
12246,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"certain charms in a strange language must also be employed, and must"
12247,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"be repeated a certain number of times. There are stones likewise, and"
12248,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"wood cut into particular forms, good against this eternal fire, as"
12249,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"they believe. The sorcerer has the power, they pretend, of giving the"
12250,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,faculty of hearing and seeing to these stones and pieces of wood; and
12251,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"when he has given them the faculties, they become so sensible and"
12252,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"grateful, they do whatever he orders. Some roll their eyes, some"
12253,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"sweat, some bleed; and the people beat their breasts before them,"
12254,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,calling themselves miserable sinners.
12255,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12256,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"_Emperor._ _Sinners_ is not the name I should have given them,"
12257,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,although no doubt they are in the right.
12258,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12259,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"_Tsing-Ti._ Sometimes, if they will not bleed freely, nor sweat, nor"
12260,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"roll their eyes, the devouter break their heads with clubs, and look"
12261,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,out for others who will.
12262,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12263,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"_Emperor._ Take heed, Tsing-Ti! Take heed! I do believe thou art"
12264,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,talking all the while of idols. Thou must be respectful; remember I am
12265,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,head of all the religions in the empire. We have something in our own
12266,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"country not very unlike them, only the people do not worship them;"
12267,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,they merely fall down before them as representatives of a higher
12268,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,power. So they say.
12269,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12270,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"_Tsing-Ti._ I do not imagine they go much farther in Europe, excepting"
12271,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,the introduction of this club-law into their adoration.
12272,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12273,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"_Emperor._ And difference enough, in all conscience. Our people is"
12274,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,less ferocious and less childish. If any man break an idol here for
12275,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"not sweating, he himself would justly be condemned to sweat, showing"
12276,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,him how inconvenient a thing it is when the sweater is not disposed.
12277,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"As for rolling the eyes, surely they know best whom they should ogle;"
12278,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"as for bleeding, that must be regulated by the season of the year. Let"
12279,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,every man choose his idol as freely as he chooses his wife; let him be
12280,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"constant if he can; if he cannot, let him at least be civil. Whoever"
12281,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"dares to scratch the face of any one in my empire, shall be condemned"
12282,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"to varnish it afresh, and moreover to keep it in repair all his"
12283,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,lifetime.
12284,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12285,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,_Tsing-Ti._ In Europe such an offence would be punished with the
12286,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,extremities of torture.
12287,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12288,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"_Emperor._ Perhaps their idols cost more, and are newer. Is there no"
12289,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"chance, in all their changes, that we may be called upon to supply"
12290,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,them with a few?
12291,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12292,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"_Tsing-Ti._ They have plenty for the present, and they dig up fresh"
12293,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,occasionally.
12294,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12295,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"_Emperor._ In regard to the worship of idols, they have not a great"
12296,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,deal to learn from us; and what is deficient will come by degrees as
12297,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,they grow humaner. But how little care can any ruler have for the
12298,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"happiness and improvement of his people, who permits such ferocity in"
12299,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,the priesthood. If its members are employed by the government to
12300,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"preside at burials, as according to thy discourse I suppose, a"
12301,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"virtuous prince would order a twelvemonth's imprisonment, and spare"
12302,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"diet, to whichever of them should refuse to perform the last office of"
12303,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,humanity toward a fellow-creature. What separation of citizen from
12304,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"citizen, and necessarily what diminution of national strength, must be"
12305,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,the consequence of such a system! A single act of it ought to be
12306,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"punished more severely than any single act of sedition, not only as"
12307,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"being a greater distractor of civic union, but, in its cruel"
12308,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"sequestration of the best affections, a fouler violator of domestic"
12309,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"peace. I always had fancied, from the books in my library, that the"
12310,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,Christian religion was founded on brotherly love and pure equality. I
12311,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"may calculate ill; but, in my hasty estimate, damnation and dog-burial"
12312,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,stand many removes from these.
12313,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12314,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"'Wait a little,' the Emperor continued: 'I wish to read in my library"
12315,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,the two names that my father said are considered the two greatest in
12316,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"the West, and may vie nearly with the highest of our own country.'"
12317,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12318,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,Whereupon did his majesty walk forth into his library; and my eyes
12319,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"followed his glorious figure as he passed through the doorway,"
12320,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"traversing the _gallery of the peacocks_, so called because fifteen of"
12321,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"those beautiful birds unite their tails in the centre of the ceiling,"
12322,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"painted so naturally as to deceive the beholder, each carrying in his"
12323,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"beak a different flower, the most beautiful in China, and bending his"
12324,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,neck in such a manner as to present it to the passer below. Traversing
12325,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"this gallery, his majesty with his own hand drew aside the curtain of"
12326,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"the library door. His majesty then entered; and, after some delay, he"
12327,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"appeared with two long scrolls, and shook them gently over the"
12328,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"fish-pond, in this dormitory of the sages. Suddenly there were so many"
12329,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,splashes and plunges that I was aware of the gratification the fishes
12330,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"had received from the grubs in them, and the disappointment in the"
12331,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"atoms of dust. His majesty, with his own right hand, drew the two"
12332,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"scrolls trailing on the marble pavement, and pointing to them with his"
12333,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"left, said:"
12334,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12335,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,'Here they are; Nhu-Tong: Pa-Kong. Suppose they had died where the
12336,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"sorcerer's men held firm footing, would the priests have refused them"
12337,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,burial?'
12338,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12339,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"I bowed my head at the question; for a single tinge of red, whether"
12340,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,arising from such ultra-bestial cruelty in those who have the
12341,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"impudence to accuse the cannibals of theirs, or whether from abhorrent"
12342,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"shame at the corroding disease of intractable superstition, hereditary"
12343,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"in the European nations for fifteen centuries, a tinge of red came"
12344,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,over the countenance of the emperor. When I raised up again my
12345,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"forehead, after such time as I thought would have removed all traces"
12346,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"of it, still fixing my eyes on the ground, I answered:"
12347,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12348,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,'O Emperor! the most zealous would have done worse. They would have
12349,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"prepared these great men for burial, and then have left them"
12350,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,unburied.'
12351,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12352,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"_Emperor._ So! so! they would have embalmed them, in their reverence"
12353,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"for meditation and genius, although their religion prohibits the"
12354,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,ceremony of interring them.
12355,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12356,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"_Tsing-Ti._ Alas, sire, my meaning is far different. They would have"
12357,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"dislocated their limbs with pulleys, broken them with hammers, and"
12358,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,then have burnt the flesh off the bones. This is called an _act of
12359,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,faith_.
12360,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12361,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"_Emperor._ _Faith_, didst thou say? Tsing-Ti, thou speakest bad"
12362,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,Chinese: thy native tongue is strangely occidentalized.
12363,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12364,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,_Tsing-Ti._ So they call it.
12365,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12366,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,_Emperor._ God hath not given unto all men the use of speech. Thou
12367,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"meanest to designate the ancient inhabitants of the country, not those"
12368,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,who have lived there within the last three centuries.
12369,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12370,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,_Tsing-Ti._ The Spaniards and Italians (such are the names of the
12371,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,nations who are most under the influence of the spells) were never so
12372,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,barbarous and cruel as during the first of the last three centuries.
12373,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,The milder of them would have refused two cubits of earth to the two
12374,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,philosophers; and not only would have rejected them from the cemetery
12375,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"of the common citizens, but from the side of the common hangman; the"
12376,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"most ignorant priest thinking himself much wiser, and the most"
12377,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,enlightened prince not daring to act openly as one who could think
12378,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,otherwise. The Italians had formerly two illustrious men among them;
12379,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"the earlier was a poet, the later a philosopher; one was exiled, the"
12380,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"other was imprisoned, and both were within a span of being burnt"
12381,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,alive.
12382,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,
12383,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,_Emperor._ We have in Asia some odd religions and some barbarous
12384,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,"princes, but neither are like the Europeans. In the name of God! do"
12385,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,the fools think of their Christianity as our neighbours in Tartary
12386,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,(with better reason) think of their milk; that it will keep the longer
12387,THE EMPEROR OF CHINA AND TSING-TI,for turning sour? or that it must be wholesome because it is heady?

12394,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12395,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12396,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ M. Talleyrand! in common with all my family, all France, all"
12397,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"Europe, I entertain the highest opinion of your abilities and"
12398,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"integrity. You have convinced me that your heart, throughout the"
12399,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"storms of the revolution, leaned constantly toward royalty; and that"
12400,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"you permitted and even encouraged the caresses of the usurper, merely"
12401,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,that you might strangle the more certainly and the more easily his
12402,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"new-born empire. After this, it is impossible to withhold my"
12403,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,confidence from you.
12404,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12405,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ Conscious of the ridicule his arrogance and presumption
12406,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"would incur, the usurper attempted to silence and stifle it with"
12407,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,other and far different emotions. Half his cruelties were perpetrated
12408,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,that his vanity might not be wounded: for scorn is superseded by
12409,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,horror. Whenever he committed an action or uttered a sentiment which
12410,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"would render him an object of derision, he instantly gave vent to"
12411,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,another which paralysed by its enormous wickedness. He would extirpate
12412,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,a nation to extinguish a smile. No man alive could deceive your
12413,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"majesty: the extremely few who would wish to do it, lie under that"
12414,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"vigilant and piercing eye, which discerned in perspective from the"
12415,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,gardens of Hartwell those of the Tuileries and Versailles. As joy
12416,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"arises from calamity, so spring arises from the bosom of winter,"
12417,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"purely to receive your majesty, inviting the august descendant of"
12418,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,their glorious founder to adorn and animate them again with his
12419,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"beneficent and gracious presence. The waters murmur, in voices"
12420,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"half-suppressed, the reverential hymn of peace restored: the woods bow"
12421,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,their heads....
12422,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12423,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ Talking of woods, I am apprehensive all the game has been"
12424,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,woefully killed up in my forests.
12425,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12426,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ A single year will replenish them.
12427,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12428,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ Meanwhile! M. Talleyrand! meanwhile!
12429,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12430,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Talleyrand._ Honest and active and watchful gamekeepers, in"
12431,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"sufficient number, must be sought; and immediately."
12432,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12433,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ Alas! if the children of my nobility had been educated like
12434,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"the children of the English, I might have promoted some hundreds of"
12435,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,them in this department. But their talents lie totally within the
12436,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"binding of their breviaries. Those of them who shoot, can shoot only"
12437,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"with pistols; which accomplishment they acquired in England, that they"
12438,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,might challenge any of the islanders who should happen to look with
12439,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"surprise or displeasure in their faces, expecting to be noticed by"
12440,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"them in Paris, for the little hospitalities the proud young gentlemen,"
12441,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"and their prouder fathers, were permitted to offer them in London and"
12442,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"at their country-seats. What we call _reconnaissance_, they call"
12443,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_gratitude_, treating a recollector like a debtor. This is a want of"
12444,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"courtesy, a defect in civilization, which it behoves us to supply. Our"
12445,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"memories are as tenacious as theirs, and rather more eclectic."
12446,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12447,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,Since my return to my kingdom I have undergone great indignities from
12448,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"this unreflecting people. One Canova, a sculptor at Rome, visited"
12449,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"Paris in the name of the Pope, and in quality of his envoy, and"
12450,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,insisted on the cession of those statues and pictures which were
12451,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,brought into France by the French armies. He began to remove them out
12452,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"of the gallery: I told him I would never give my consent: he replied,"
12453,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"he thought it sufficient that he had Wellington's. Therefore, the next"
12454,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"time Wellington presented himself at the Tuileries, I turned my back"
12455,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,upon him before the whole court. Let the English and their allies be
12456,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"aware, that I owe my restoration not to them, but partly to God and"
12457,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,partly to Saint Louis. They and their armies are only brute
12458,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,instruments in the hands of my progenitor and intercessor.
12459,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12460,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Talleyrand._ Fortunate, that the conqueror of France bears no"
12461,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,resemblance to the conqueror of Spain. Peterborough (I shudder at the
12462,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,idea) would have ordered a file of soldiers to seat your Majesty in
12463,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"your travelling carriage, and would have reinstalled you at Hartwell."
12464,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"The English people are so barbarous, that he would have done it not"
12465,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"only with impunity, but with applause."
12466,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12467,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ But the sovereign of his country ... would the sovereign
12468,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,suffer it?
12469,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12470,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Talleyrand._ Alas! sire! Confronted with such men, what are"
12471,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"sovereigns, when the people are the judges? Wellington can drill"
12472,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,armies: Peterborough could marshal nations.
12473,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12474,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ Thank God! we have no longer any such pests on earth. The
12475,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,most consummate general of our days (such is Wellington) sees nothing
12476,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,one single inch beyond the field of battle; and he is so observant of
12477,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"discipline, that if I ordered him to be flogged in the presence of the"
12478,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"allied armies, he would not utter a complaint nor shrug a shoulder; he"
12479,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,would only write a dispatch.
12480,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12481,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ But his soldiers would execute the Duke of Brunswick's
12482,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"manifesto, and Paris would sink into her catacombs. No man so little"
12483,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"beloved was ever so well obeyed: and there is not a man in England, of"
12484,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"either party, citizen or soldier, who would not rather die than see"
12485,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"him disgraced. His firmness, his moderation, his probity, place him"
12486,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,more opposite to Napoleon than he stood in the field of Waterloo.
12487,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"These are his lofty lines of Torres Vedras, which no enemy dares"
12488,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,assail throughout their whole extent.
12489,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12490,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ M. Talleyrand! is it quite right to extol an enemy and an
12491,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,Englishman in this manner?
12492,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12493,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ Pardon! Sire! I stand corrected. Forgive me a momentary
12494,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"fit of enthusiasm, in favour of those qualities by which, although an"
12495,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"Englishman's, I am placed again in your majesty's service."
12496,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12497,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ We will now then go seriously to business. Wellington and the
12498,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,allied armies have interrupted and occupied us. I will instantly
12499,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"write, with my own hand, to the Marquis of Buckingham, desiring him to"
12500,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"send me five hundred pheasants' eggs. I am restored to my throne, M."
12501,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,Talleyrand! but in what a condition! Not a pheasant on the table! I
12502,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"must throw myself on the mercy of foreigners, even for a pheasant!"
12503,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"When I have written my letter, I shall be ready to converse with you"
12504,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,on the business on which I desired your presence. [_Writes._] Here;
12505,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,read it. Give me your opinion: is not the note a model?
12506,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12507,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Talleyrand._ If the charms of language could be copied, it would be."
12508,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,But what is intended for delight may terminate in despair: and there
12509,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"are words which, unapproachable by distance and sublimity, may wither"
12510,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,the laurels on the most exalted of literary brows.
12511,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12512,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ There is grace in that expression of yours, M. Talleyrand!"
12513,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,there is really no inconsiderable grace in it. Seal my letter: direct
12514,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"it to the Marquis of Buckingham at Stowe. Wait: open it again: no, no:"
12515,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,write another in your own name: instruct him how sure you are it will
12516,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"be agreeable to me, if he sends at the same time fifty or a hundred"
12517,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,brace of the birds as well as the eggs. At present I am desolate. My
12518,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"heart is torn, M. Talleyrand! it is almost plucked out of my bosom. I"
12519,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"have no other care, no other thought, day or night, but the happiness"
12520,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"of my people. The allies, who have most shamefully overlooked the"
12521,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"destitution of my kitchen, seem resolved to turn a deaf ear to its"
12522,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"cries evermore; nay, even to render them shriller and shriller. The"
12523,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"allies, I suspect, are resolved to execute the design of the"
12524,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,mischievous Pitt.
12525,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12526,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ May it please your majesty to inform me _which_ of them;
12527,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"for he formed a thousand, all mischievous, but greatly more"
12528,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"mischievous to England than to France. Resolved to seize the sword, in"
12529,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"his drunkenness, he seized it by the edge, and struck at us with the"
12530,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"hilt, until he broke it off and until he himself was exhausted by loss"
12531,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"of breath and of blood. We owe alike to him the energy of our armies,"
12532,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"the bloody scaffolds of public safety, the Reign of Terror, the empire"
12533,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"of usurpation, and finally, as the calm is successor to the tempest,"
12534,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"and sweet fruit to bitter kernel, the blessing of your majesty's"
12535,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"restoration. Excepting in this one event, he was mischievous to our"
12536,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"country; but in all events, and in all undertakings, he was pernicious"
12537,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,to his own. No man ever brought into the world such enduring evil; few
12538,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,men such extensive.
12539,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12540,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ His king ordered it. George III loved battles and blood.
12541,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12542,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ But he was prudent in his appetite for them.
12543,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12544,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ He talked of peppering his people as I would talk of
12545,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,peppering a capon.
12546,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12547,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ Having split it. His subjects cut up by his subjects
12548,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,were only capers to his leg of mutton. From none of his palaces and
12549,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"parks was there any view so rural, so composing to his spirits, as the"
12550,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"shambles. When these were not fresh, the gibbet would do."
12551,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12552,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,I wish better luck to the pheasants' eggs than befell Mr. Pitt's
12553,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,designs. Not one brought forth anything.
12554,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12555,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ No: but he declared in the face of his Parliament, and of"
12556,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"Europe, that he would insist on indemnity for the past and security"
12557,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"for the future. These were his words. Now, all the money and other"
12558,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"wealth the French armies levied in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and"
12559,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"everywhere else, would scarcely be sufficient for this indemnity."
12560,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12561,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ England shall never receive from us a tithe of that
12562,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,amount.
12563,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12564,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ A tithe of it! She may demand a quarter or a third, and leave"
12565,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,us wondering at her moderation and forbearance.
12566,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12567,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Talleyrand._ The matter must be arranged immediately, before she has"
12568,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,time for calculation or reflection. A new peace maddens England to the
12569,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,same paroxysm as a new war maddens France. She hath sent over hither
12570,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,her minister ... or rather her prime minister himself is come to
12571,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,transact all the business ... the most ignorant and most shortsighted
12572,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,man to be found in any station of any public office throughout the
12573,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,whole of Europe. He must be treated as her arbiter: we must talk to
12574,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"him of restoring her, of regenerating her, of preserving her, of"
12575,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"guiding her, which (we must protest with our hands within our frills)"
12576,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,he alone is capable of doing. We must enlarge on his generosity (and
12577,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"generous he indeed is), and there is nothing he will not concede."
12578,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12579,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ But if they do not come over in a week, we shall lose the"
12580,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,season. I ought to be eating a pheasant-poult by the middle of July.
12581,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"Oh, but you were talking to me about the other matter, and perhaps the"
12582,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"weightier of the two; ay, certainly. If this indemnity is paid to"
12583,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"England, what becomes of our civil list, the dignity of my family and"
12584,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,household?
12585,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12586,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Talleyrand._ I do assure your majesty, England shall never receive ..."
12587,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,did I say a tithe?... I say she shall never receive a fiftieth of what
12588,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"she expended in the war against us. It would be out of all reason, and"
12589,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,out of all custom in her to expect it. Indeed it would place her in
12590,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,almost as good a condition as ourselves. Even if she were beaten she
12591,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,could hardly hope _that_: she never in the last three centuries has
12592,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"demanded it when she was victorious. Of all the sufferers by the war,"
12593,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,we shall be the best off.
12594,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12595,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ The English are calculators and traders.
12596,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12597,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Talleyrand._ Wild speculators, gamblers in trade, who hazard more"
12598,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,ventures than their books can register. It will take England some
12599,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,years to cast up the amount of her losses.
12600,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12601,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ But she, in common with her allies, will insist on our ceding"
12602,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,those provinces which my predecessor Louis XIV annexed to his kingdom.
12603,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"Be quite certain that nothing short of Alsace, Lorraine, and Franc"
12604,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"Comt√©, will satisfy the German princes. They must restore the German"
12605,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,language in those provinces: for languages are the only true
12606,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"boundaries of nations, and there will always be dissension where there"
12607,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,is difference of tongue. We must likewise be prepared to surrender the
12608,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"remainder of the Netherlands; not indeed to England, who refused them"
12609,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"in the reign of Elizabeth: she wants only Dunkirk, and Dunkirk she"
12610,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,will have.
12611,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12612,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ This seems reasonable: for which reason it must never
12613,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"be. Diplomacy, when she yields to such simple arguments as plain"
12614,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"reason urges against her, loses her office, her efficacy, and her"
12615,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,name.
12616,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12617,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ I would not surrender our conquests in Germany, if I could"
12618,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,help it.
12619,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12620,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ Nothing more easy. The Emperor Alexander may be
12621,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"persuaded that Germany united and entire, as she would then become,"
12622,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,must be a dangerous rival to Russia.
12623,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12624,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ It appears to me that Poland will be more so, with her free"
12625,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,institutions.
12626,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12627,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ There is only one statesman in the whole number of those
12628,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"assembled at Paris, who believes that her institutions will continue"
12629,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"free; and he would rather they did not; but he stipulates for it, to"
12630,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,gratify and mystify the people of England.
12631,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12632,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ I see this clearly. I have a great mind to send Blacas over
12633,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"to Stowe. I can trust to him to look to the crates and coops, and to"
12634,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"see that the pheasants have enough of air and water, and that the"
12635,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"Governor of Calais finds a commodious place for them to roost in,"
12636,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"forbidding the drums to beat and disturb them, evening or morning. The"
12637,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"next night, according to my calculation, they repose at Montreuil. I"
12638,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,must look at them before they are let loose. I cannot well imagine why
12639,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"the public men employed by England are usually, indeed constantly so"
12640,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"inferior in abilities to those of France, Prussia, Austria, and"
12641,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"Russia. What say you, M. Talleyrand? I do not mean about the"
12642,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,pheasants; I mean about the envoys.
12643,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12644,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ It can only be that I have considered the subject more
12645,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"frequently and attentively than suited the avocations of your majesty,"
12646,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,that the reason comes out before me clearly and distinctly. The prime
12647,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"ministers, in all these countries, are independent, and uncontrolled"
12648,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,in the choice of agents. A prime minister in France may perhaps be
12649,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,willing to promote the interests of his own family; and hence he may
12650,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,appoint from it one unworthy of the place. In regard to other
12651,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"families, he cares little or nothing about them, knowing that his"
12652,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"power lies in the palace, and not in the club-room. Whereas in England"
12653,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"he must conciliate the great families, the hereditary dependants of"
12654,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"his faction, Whig or Tory. Hence even the highest commands have been"
12655,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,conferred on such ignorant and worthless men as the Duke of York and
12656,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"the Earl of Chatham, although the minister was fully aware that the"
12657,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"honour of his nation was tarnished, and that its safety was in"
12658,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"jeopardy, by such appointments. Meanwhile he kept his seat however,"
12659,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,and fed from it his tame creatures in the cub.
12660,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12661,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ Do you apprehend any danger (talking of cubs) that my
12662,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"pheasants will be bruised against the wooden bars, or suffer by"
12663,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,sea-sickness? I would not command my bishops to offer up public
12664,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,prayers against such contingencies: for people must never have
12665,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,positive evidence that the prayers of the Church can possibly be
12666,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,ineffectual: and we cannot pray for pheasants as we pray for fine
12667,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"weather, by the barometer. We must drop it. Now go on with the others,"
12668,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,if you have done with England.
12669,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12670,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Talleyrand._ A succession of intelligent men rules Prussia, Russia,"
12671,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"and Austria; because these three are economical, and must get their"
12672,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"bread by creeping, day after day, through the hedges next to them, and"
12673,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"by filching a sheaf or two, early and late, from cottager or small"
12674,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"farmer; that is to say, from free states and petty princes. Prussia,"
12675,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"like a mongrel, would fly at the legs of Austria and Russia, catching"
12676,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"them with the sack upon their shoulders, unless they untied it and"
12677,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,tossed a morsel to her. These great powers take especial care to
12678,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"impose a protective duty on intellect; to let none enter the country,"
12679,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"and none leave it, without a passport. Their diplomatists are as"
12680,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,clever and conciliatory as those of England are ignorant and
12681,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"repulsive, who, while they offer an uncounted sum of secret-service"
12682,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"money with the left hand, give a sounding slap on the face with the"
12683,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,right.
12684,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12685,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ We, by adopting a contrary policy, gain more information,"
12686,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"raise more respect, inspire more awe, and exercise more authority. The"
12687,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"weightiest of our disbursements are smiles and flatteries, with a"
12688,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,ribbon and a cross at the end of them.
12689,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12690,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"But, between the Duke of York and the Earl of Chatham, I must confess,"
12691,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,I find very little difference.
12692,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12693,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Talleyrand._ Some, however. The one was only drunk all the evening"
12694,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,and all the night; the other was only asleep all the day. The
12695,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"accumulated fogs of Walcheren seemed to concentrate in his brain,"
12696,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,puffing out at intervals just sufficient to affect with typhus and
12697,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,blindness four thousand soldiers. A cake of powder rusted their
12698,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"musket-pans, which they were too weak to open and wipe. Turning round"
12699,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"upon their scanty and mouldy straw, they beheld their bayonets piled"
12700,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"together against the green dripping wall of the chamber, which neither"
12701,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,bayonet nor soldier was ever to leave again.
12702,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12703,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ We suffer by the presence of the allied armies in our
12704,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,capital: but we shall soon be avenged: for the English minister in
12705,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,another fortnight will return and remain at home.
12706,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12707,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ England was once so infatuated as to give up Malta to
12708,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"us, although fifty Gibraltars would be of inferior value to her."
12709,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,Napoleon laughed at her: she was angry: she began to suspect she had
12710,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,been duped and befooled: and she broke her faith.
12711,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12712,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ For the first time, M. Talleyrand, and with a man who never"
12713,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,had any.
12714,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12715,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Talleyrand._ We shall now induce her to evacuate Sicily, in violation"
12716,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"of her promises to the people of that island. Faith, having lost her"
12717,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"virginity, braves public opinion, and never blushes more."
12718,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12719,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ Sicily is the key to India, Egypt is the lock."
12720,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12721,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Talleyrand._ What, if I induce the minister to restore to us"
12722,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,Pondicherry?
12723,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12724,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ M. Talleyrand! you have done great things, and without"
12725,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"boasting. Whenever you do boast, let it be that you will perform only"
12726,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,the thing which is possible. The English know well enough what it is
12727,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,to allow us a near standing-place anywhere. If they permit a Frenchman
12728,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"to plant one foot in India, it will upset all Asia before the other"
12729,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,touches the ground. It behoves them to prohibit a single one of us
12730,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,from ever landing on those shores. Improbable as it is that a man
12731,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,uniting to the same degree as Hyder-Ali did political and military
12732,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"genius, will appear in the world again for centuries; most of the"
12733,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"princes are politic, some are brave, and perhaps no few are credulous."
12734,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"While England is confiding in our loyalty, we might expatiate on her"
12735,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"perfidy, and our tears fall copiously on the broken sceptre in the"
12736,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"dust of Delhi. Ignorant and stupid as the king's ministers may be, the"
12737,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"East India Company is well-informed on its interests, and alert in"
12738,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,maintaining them. I wonder that a republic so wealthy and so wise
12739,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"should be supported on the bosom of royalty. Believe me, her merchants"
12740,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"will take alarm, and arouse the nation."
12741,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12742,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Talleyrand._ We must do all we have to do, while the nation is"
12743,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,feasting and unsober. It will awaken with sore eyes and stiff limbs.
12744,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12745,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ Profuse as the English are, they will never cut the bottom of"
12746,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,their purses.
12747,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12748,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ They have already done it. Whenever I look toward the
12749,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"shores of England, I fancy I descry the Dana√Øds there, toiling at the"
12750,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"replenishment of their perforated vases, and all the Nereids leering"
12751,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,and laughing at them in the mischievous fullness of their hearts.
12752,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12753,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ Certainly she can do me little harm at present, and for"
12754,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"several years to come: but we must always have an eye upon her, and be"
12755,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,ready to assert our superiority.
12756,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12757,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Talleyrand._ We feel it. In fifty years, by abstaining from war, we"
12758,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,may discharge our debt and replenish our arsenals. England will never
12759,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"shake off the heavy old man from her shoulders. Overladen and morose,"
12760,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,she will be palsied in the hand she unremittingly holds up against
12761,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"Ireland. Proud and perverse, she runs into domestic warfare as blindly"
12762,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,as France runs into foreign: and she refuses to her subject what she
12763,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,surrenders to her enemy.
12764,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12765,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ Her whole policy tends to my security.
12766,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12767,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ We must now consider how your majesty may enjoy it at
12768,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"home, all the remainder of your reign."
12769,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12770,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ Indeed you must, M. Talleyrand! Between you and me be it"
12771,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"spoken, I trust but little my loyal people; their loyalty being so"
12772,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"ebullient, that it often overflows the vessel which should contain it,"
12773,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,and is a perquisite of scouts and scullions. I do not wish to offend
12774,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,you.
12775,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12776,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ Really I can see no other sure method of containing and
12777,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"controlling them, than by bastions and redoubts, the whole circuit of"
12778,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,the city.
12779,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12780,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ M. Talleyrand! I will not doubt your sincerity: I am
12781,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,confident you have reserved the whole of it for my service; and there
12782,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,are large arrears. But M. Talleyrand! such an attempt would be
12783,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"resisted by any people which had ever heard of liberty, and much more"
12784,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,by a people which had ever dreamt of enjoying it.
12785,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12786,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ Forts are built in all directions above Genoa.
12787,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12788,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Louis._ Yes; by her conqueror, not by her king."
12789,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12790,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"_Talleyrand._ Your majesty comes with both titles, and rules, like"
12791,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"your great progenitor,"
12792,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12793,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,Et par droit de conqu√™te et par droit de naissance.
12794,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12795,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ True; my arms have subdued the rebellious; but not without
12796,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"great firmness and great valour on my part, and some assistance"
12797,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,(however tardy) on the part of my allies. Conquerors must conciliate:
12798,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,fatherly kings must offer digestible spoon-meat to their
12799,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,ill-conditioned children. There would be sad screaming and kicking
12800,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"were I to swaddle mine in stone-work. No, M. Talleyrand; if ever Paris"
12801,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"is surrounded by fortifications to coerce the populace, it must be the"
12802,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"work of some democrat, some aspirant to supreme power, who resolves to"
12803,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"maintain it, exercising a domination too hazardous for legitimacy. I"
12804,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,will only scrape from the chambers the effervescence of superficial
12805,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,letters and corrosive law.
12806,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12807,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Talleyrand._ Sire! under all their governments the good people of
12808,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"Paris have submitted to the _octroi_. Now, all complaints, physical or"
12809,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"political, arise from the stomach. Were it decorous in a subject to"
12810,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"ask a question (however humbly) of his king, I would beg permission to"
12811,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"inquire of your majesty, in your wisdom, whether a bar across the"
12812,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,shoulders is less endurable than a bar across the palate. Sire! the
12813,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,French can bear anything now they have the honour of bowing before
12814,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,your majesty.
12815,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12816,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,_Louis._ The compliment is in a slight degree (a _very_ slight degree)
12817,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"ambiguous, and (accept in good part my criticism, M. Talleyrand) not"
12818,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,turned with your usual grace.
12819,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12820,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,Announce it as my will and pleasure that the Duc de Blacas do
12821,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"superintend the debarkation of the pheasants; and I pray God, M. de"
12822,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,"Talleyrand, to have you in His holy keeping."
12823,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12824,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12825,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12826,LOUIS XVIII AND TALLEYRAND,
12827,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL
12828,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12829,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12830,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ How many saints and Sions dost carry under thy cloak,"
12831,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"lad? Ay, what dost groan at? What art about to be delivered of? Troth,"
12832,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,it must be a vast and oddly-shapen piece of roguery which findeth no
12833,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,issue at such capacious quarters. I never thought to see thy face
12834,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"again. Prithee what, in God's name, hath brought thee to Ramsey, fair"
12835,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,Master Oliver?
12836,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12837,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Oliver._ In His name verily I come, and upon His errand; and the love"
12838,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"and duty I bear unto my godfather and uncle have added wings, in a"
12839,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"sort, unto my zeal."
12840,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12841,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Sir Oliver._ Take 'em off thy zeal and dust thy conscience with 'em.
12842,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"I have heard an account of a saint, one Phil Neri, who in the midst of"
12843,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,his devotions was lifted up several yards from the ground. Now I do
12844,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"suspect, Nol, thou wilt finish by being a saint of his order; and"
12845,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,nobody will promise or wish thee the luck to come down on thy feet
12846,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"again, as he did. So! because a rabble of fanatics at Huntingdon have"
12847,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"equipped thee as their representative in Parliament, thou art free of"
12848,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"all men's houses, forsooth! I would have thee to understand, sirrah,"
12849,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,that thou art fitter for the House they have chaired thee unto than
12850,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,for mine. Yet I do not question but thou wilt be as troublesome and
12851,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,unruly there as here. Did I not turn thee out of Hinchinbrook when
12852,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,thou wert scarcely half the rogue thou art latterly grown up to? And
12853,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,yet wert thou immeasurably too big a one for it to hold.
12854,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12855,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Oliver._ It repenteth me, O mine uncle! that in my boyhood and youth"
12856,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,the Lord had not touched me.
12857,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12858,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Sir Oliver._ Touch thee! thou wast too dirty a dog by half.
12859,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12860,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Oliver._ Yes, sorely doth it vex and harrow me that I was then of ill"
12861,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"conditions, and that my name ... even your godson's ... stank in your"
12862,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,nostrils.
12863,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12864,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ Ha! polecat! it was not thy name, although bad enough,"
12865,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"that stank first; in my house, at least. But perhaps there are worse"
12866,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,maggots in stauncher mummeries.
12867,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12868,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Oliver._ Whereas in the bowels of your charity you then vouchsafed me
12869,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"forgiveness, so the more confidently may I crave it now in this my"
12870,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,urgency.
12871,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12872,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Sir Oliver._ More confidently! What! hast got more confidence? Where
12873,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,didst find it? I never thought the wide circle of the world had within
12874,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"it another jot for thee. Well, Nol, I see no reason why shouldst stand"
12875,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"before me with thy hat off, in the courtyard and in the sun, counting"
12876,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"the stones in the pavement. Thou hast some knavery in thy head, I"
12877,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"warrant thee. Come, put on thy beaver."
12878,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12879,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Oliver._ Uncle Sir Oliver! I know my duty too well to stand covered
12880,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"in the presence of so worshipful a kinsman, who, moreover, hath"
12881,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,answered at baptism for my good behaviour.
12882,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12883,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Sir Oliver._ God forgive me for playing the fool before Him so
12884,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,presumptuously and unprofitably! Nobody shall ever take me in again to
12885,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,do such an absurd and wicked thing. But thou hast some left-handed
12886,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"business in the neighbourhood, no doubt, or thou wouldst never more"
12887,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,have come under my archway.
12888,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12889,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Oliver._ These are hard times for them that seek peace. We are clay
12890,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,in the hands of the potter.
12891,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12892,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ I wish your potters sought nothing costlier, and dug in"
12893,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"their own grounds for it. Most of us, as thou sayest, have been upon"
12894,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,the wheel of these artificers; and little was left but rags when we
12895,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,got off. Sanctified folks are the cleverest skinners in all
12896,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"Christendom, and their Jordan tans and constringes us to the"
12897,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,avoirdupois of mummies.
12898,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12899,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Oliver._ The Lord hath chosen His own vessels.
12900,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12901,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ I wish heartily He would pack them off, and send them"
12902,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"anywhere on ass-back or cart (cart preferably), to rid our country of"
12903,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,'em. But now again to the point: for if we fall among the potsherds we
12904,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,shall hobble on but lamely. Since thou art raised unto a high command
12905,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"in the army, and hast a dragoon to hold thy solid and stately piece of"
12906,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"horse-flesh, I cannot but take it into my fancy that thou hast some"
12907,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,commission of array or disarray to execute hereabout.
12908,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12909,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Oliver._ With a sad sinking of spirit, to the pitch well-nigh of"
12910,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"swounding, and with a sight of bitter tears, which will not be put"
12911,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"back nor stayed in any wise, as you bear testimony unto me, Uncle"
12912,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,Oliver!
12913,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12914,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ No tears, Master Nol, I beseech thee! Wet days, among"
12915,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"those of thy kidney, portend the letting of blood. What dost whimper"
12916,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,at?
12917,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12918,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Oliver._ That I, that I, of all men living, should be put upon this"
12919,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,work!
12920,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12921,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ What work, prithee?"
12922,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12923,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Oliver._ I am sent hither by them who (the Lord in His loving
12924,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"kindness having pity, and mercy upon these poor realms) do, under His"
12925,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"right hand, administer unto our necessities, and righteously command"
12926,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"us, _by the aforesaid as aforesaid_ (thus runs the commission), hither"
12927,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"am I deputed (woe is me!) to levy certain fines in this county, or"
12928,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"shire, on such as the Parliament in its wisdom doth style malignants."
12929,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12930,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ If there is anything left about the house, never be"
12931,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,over-nice: dismiss thy modesty and lay hands upon it. In this county
12932,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"or shire, we let go the civet-bag to save the weazon."
12933,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12934,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Oliver._ O mine uncle and godfather! be witness for me.
12935,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12936,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Sir Oliver._ Witness for thee! not I indeed. But I would rather be
12937,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"witness than surety, lad, where thou art docketed."
12938,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12939,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Oliver._ From the most despised doth the Lord ever choose His
12940,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,servants.
12941,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12942,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ Then, faith! thou art His first butler."
12943,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12944,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Oliver._ Serving Him with humility, I may peradventure be found"
12945,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,worthy of advancement.
12946,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12947,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ Ha! now if any devil speaks from within thee, it is thy"
12948,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,own: he does not snuffle: to my ears he speaks plain English. Worthy
12949,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"or unworthy of advancement, thou wilt attain it. Come in; at least for"
12950,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,an hour's rest. Formerly thou knewest the means of setting the
12951,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"heaviest heart afloat, let it be sticking in what mud-bank it might:"
12952,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,and my wet dock at Ramsey is pretty near as commodious as that over
12953,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"yonder at Hinchinbrook was erewhile. Times are changed, and places"
12954,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,too! yet the cellar holds good.
12955,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12956,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Oliver._ Many and great thanks! But there are certain men on the
12957,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"other side of the gate, who might take it ill if I turn away and"
12958,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,neglect them.
12959,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12960,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ Let them enter also, or eat their victuals where they"
12961,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,are.
12962,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12963,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Oliver._ They have proud stomachs: they are recusants.
12964,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12965,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ Recusants of what? of beef and ale? We have claret, I"
12966,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"trust, for the squeamish, if they are above the condition of"
12967,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,tradespeople. But of course you leave no person of higher quality in
12968,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,the outer court.
12969,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12970,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Oliver._ Vain are they and worldly, although such wickedness is the"
12971,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,most abominable in their cases. Idle folks are fond of sitting in the
12972,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,sun: I would not forbid them this indulgence.
12973,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12974,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Sir Oliver._ But who are they?
12975,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12976,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Oliver._ The Lord knows. Maybe priests, deacons, and such-like."
12977,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12978,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ Then, sir, they are gentlemen. And the commission you"
12979,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"bear from the parliamentary thieves, to sack and pillage my"
12980,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"mansion-house, is far less vexatious and insulting to me, than your"
12981,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,behaviour in keeping them so long at my stable-door. With your
12982,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"permission, or without it, I shall take the liberty to invite them to"
12983,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,partake of my poor hospitality.
12984,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12985,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Oliver._ But, Uncle Sir Oliver! there are rules and ordinances"
12986,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,whereby it must be manifested that they lie under displeasure ... not
12987,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,mine ... not mine ... but my milk must not flow for them.
12988,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12989,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ You may enter the house or remain where you are, at your"
12990,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"option; I make my visit to these gentlemen immediately, for I am tired"
12991,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"of standing. If thou ever reachest my age,[12] Oliver! (but God will"
12992,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,not surely let this be) thou wilt know that the legs become at last of
12993,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,doubtful fidelity in the service of the body.
12994,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
12995,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Oliver._ Uncle Sir Oliver! now that, as it seemeth, you have been"
12996,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"taking a survey of the courtyard and its contents, am I indiscreet in"
12997,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,asking your worship whether I acted not prudently in keeping the
12998,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_men-at-belly_ under the custody of the _men-at-arms_? This
12999,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"pestilence, like unto one I remember to have read about in some poetry"
13000,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"of Master Chapman's,[13] began with the dogs and mules, and afterwards"
13001,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,crope up into the breasts of men.
13002,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13003,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Sir Oliver._ I call such treatment barbarous; their troopers will not
13004,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"let the gentlemen come with me into the house, but insist on sitting"
13005,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"down to dinner with them. And yet, having brought them out of their"
13006,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"colleges, these brutal half-soldiers must know that they are fellows."
13007,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13008,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Oliver._ Yea, of a truth are they, and fellows well met. Out of their"
13009,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"superfluities they give nothing to the Lord or His saints; no, not"
13010,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"even stirrup or girth, wherewith we may mount our horses and go forth"
13011,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"against those who thirst for our blood. Their eyes are fat, and they"
13012,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,raise not up their voices to cry for our deliverance.
13013,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13014,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Sir Oliver._ Art mad? What stirrups and girths are hung up in
13015,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,college halls and libraries? For what are these gentlemen brought
13016,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,hither?
13017,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13018,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Oliver._ They have elected me, with somewhat short of unanimity, not"
13019,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"indeed to be one of themselves, for of that distinction I acknowledge"
13020,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"and deplore my unworthiness, nor indeed to be a poor scholar, to"
13021,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"which, unless it be a very poor one, I have almost as small"
13022,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"pretension, but simply to undertake a while the heavier office of"
13023,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,bursar for them; to cast up their accounts; to overlook the scouring
13024,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"of their plate; and to lay a list thereof, with a few specimens,"
13025,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"before those who fight the fight of the Lord, that His saints, seeing"
13026,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"the abasement of the proud and the chastisement of worldly-mindedness,"
13027,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,may rejoice.
13028,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13029,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Sir Oliver._ I am grown accustomed to such saints and such
13030,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"rejoicings. But, little could I have thought, threescore years ago,"
13031,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,that the hearty and jovial people of England would ever join in so
13032,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,filching and stabbing a jocularity. Even the petticoated torchbearers
13033,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"from rotten Rome, who lighted the faggots in Smithfield some years"
13034,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"before, if more blustering and cocksy, were less bitter and vulturine."
13035,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"They were all intolerant, but they were not all hypocritical; they had"
13036,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,not always '_the Lord_' in their mouth.
13037,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13038,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Oliver._ According to their own notions, they might have had, at an"
13039,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,outlay of a farthing.
13040,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13041,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ Art facetious, Nol? for it is as hard to find that out"
13042,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"as anything else in thee, only it makes thee look, at times, a little"
13043,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,the grimmer and sourer.
13044,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13045,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"But, regarding these gentlemen from Cambridge. Not being such as, by"
13046,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"their habits and professions, could have opposed you in the field, I"
13047,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"hold it unmilitary and unmanly to put them under any restraint, and to"
13048,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,lead them away from their peaceful and useful occupations.
13049,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13050,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Oliver._ I always bow submissively before the judgment of mine
13051,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,elders; and the more reverentially when I know them to be endowed with
13052,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"greater wisdom, and guided by surer experience than myself. Alas!"
13053,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"these collegians not only are strong men, as you may readily see if"
13054,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"you measure them round the waistband, but boisterous and pertinacious"
13055,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"challengers. When we, who live in the fear of God, exhorted them"
13056,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"earnestly unto peace and brotherly love, they held us in derision."
13057,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"Thus far indeed it might be an advantage to us, teaching us"
13058,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"forbearance and self-seeking, but we cannot countenance the evil"
13059,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"spirit moving them thereunto. Their occupations, as you remark most"
13060,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"wisely, might have been useful and peaceful, and had formerly been"
13061,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,so. Why then did they gird the sword of strife about their loins
13062,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"against the children of Israel? By their own declaration, not only are"
13063,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"they our enemies, but enemies the most spiteful and untractable. When"
13064,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"I came quietly, lawfully, and in the name of the Lord, for their"
13065,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"plate, what did they? Instead of surrendering it like honest and"
13066,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"conscientious men, they attacked me and my people on horseback, with"
13067,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"syllogisms and enthymemes, and the Lord knows with what other such"
13068,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,gimcracks; such venomous and rankling old weapons as those who have
13069,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,the fear of God before their eyes are fain to lay aside. Learning
13070,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,should not make folks mockers ... should not make folks malignants ...
13071,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,should not harden their hearts. We came with bowels for them.
13072,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13073,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Sir Oliver._ That ye did! and bowels which would have stowed within
13074,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,them all the plate on board of a galleon. If tankards and
13075,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"wassail-bowls had stuck between your teeth, you would not have felt"
13076,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,them.
13077,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13078,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Oliver._ We did feel them; some at least: perhaps we missed too many.
13079,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13080,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Sir Oliver._ How can these learned societies raise the money you
13081,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"exact from them, beside plate? dost think they can create and coin it?"
13082,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13083,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Oliver._ In Cambridge, Uncle Sir Oliver, and more especially in that"
13084,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,college named in honour (as they profanely call it) of the Blessed
13085,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"Trinity, there are great conjurors or chemists. Now the said conjurors"
13086,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,or chemists not only do possess the faculty of making the precious
13087,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"metals out of old books and parchments, but out of the skulls of young"
13088,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"lordlings and gentlefolks, which verily promise less. And this they"
13089,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,bring about by certain gold wires fastened at the top of certain caps.
13090,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"Of said metals, thus devilishly converted, do they make a vain and"
13091,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"sumptuous use; so that, finally, they are afraid of cutting their lips"
13092,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,with glass. But indeed it is high time to call them.
13093,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13094,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Sir Oliver._ Well ... at last thou hast some mercy.
13095,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13096,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,_Oliver._ [_Aloud._] Cuffsatan Ramsbottom! Sadsoul Kiteclaw! advance!
13097,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"Let every gown, together with the belly that is therein, mount up"
13098,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,behind you and your comrades in good fellowship. And forasmuch as you
13099,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"at the country places look to bit and bridle, it seemeth fair and"
13100,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"equitable that ye should leave unto them, in full propriety, the"
13101,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,mancipular office of discharging the account. If there be any spare
13102,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"beds at the inns, allow the doctors and dons to occupy the same ..."
13103,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,they being used to lie softly; and be not urgent that more than three
13104,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,lie in each ... they being mostly corpulent. Let pass quietly and
13105,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"unreproved any light bubble of pride or impetuosity, seeing that they"
13106,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,have not always been accustomed to the service of guards and ushers.
13107,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"The Lord be with ye!... Slow trot! And now, Uncle Sir Oliver, I can"
13108,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"resist no longer your loving kindness. I kiss you, my godfather, in"
13109,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,heart's and soul's duty; and most humbly and gratefully do I accept of
13110,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"your invitation to dine and lodge with you, albeit the least worthy of"
13111,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"your family and kinsfolk. After the refreshment of needful food, more"
13112,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"needful prayer, and that sleep which descendeth on the innocent like"
13113,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"the dew of Hermon, to-morrow at daybreak I proceed on my journey"
13114,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,Londonward.
13115,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,
13116,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"_Sir Oliver._ [_Aloud._] Ho, there! [_To a servant._] Let dinner be"
13117,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,"prepared in the great dining-room; let every servant be in waiting,"
13118,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,each in full livery; let every delicacy the house affords be placed
13119,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,upon the table in due courses; arrange all the plate upon the
13120,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,sideboard: a gentleman by descent ... a stranger ... has claimed my
13121,OLIVER CROMWELL AND SIR OLIVER CROMWELL,hospitality. [_Servant goes._]

13198,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Annabella._ Because you really are so very very brown: just like
13199,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","those ugly Turks who sawed the pines in the saw-pit under the wood,"
13200,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","and who refused to drink wine in the heat of summer, when Wilhelm and"
13201,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",I brought it to them. Do not be angry; we did it only once.
13202,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13203,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Wilhelm._ Because one of them stamped and frightened her when the
13204,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",other seemed to bless us.
13205,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13206,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Count._ Are they still living?
13207,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13208,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ One of them is.
13209,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13210,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Wilhelm._ The fierce one.
13211,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13212,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Count._ We will set him free, and wish it were the other."
13213,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13214,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Annabella._ Papa! I am glad you are come back without your spurs.
13215,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13216,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Countess._ Hush, child, hush."
13217,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13218,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Annabella._ Why, mamma? Do not you remember how they tore my frock"
13219,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",when I clung to him at parting? Now I begin to think of him again: I
13220,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",lose everything between that day and this.
13221,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13222,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ The girl's idle prattle about the spurs has pained you:
13223,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","always too sensitive; always soon hurt, though never soon offended."
13224,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13225,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Count._ O God! O my children! O my wife! it is not the loss of spurs
13226,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",I now must blush for.
13227,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13228,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Annabella._ Indeed, papa, you never can blush at all, until you cut"
13229,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",that horrid beard off.
13230,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13231,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Countess._ Well may you say, my own Ludolph, as you do; for most"
13232,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",gallant was your bearing in the battle.
13233,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13234,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Count._ Ah! why was it ever fought?
13235,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13236,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ Why were most battles? But they may lead to glory even
13237,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",through slavery.
13238,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13239,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Count._ And to shame and sorrow.
13240,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13241,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Countess._ Have I lost the little beauty I possessed, that you hold"
13242,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","my hand so languidly, and turn away your eyes when they meet mine? It"
13243,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",was not so formerly ... unless when first we loved.
13244,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13245,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",That one kiss restores to me all my lost happiness.
13246,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13247,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",Come; the table is ready: there are your old wines upon it: you must
13248,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",want that refreshment.
13249,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13250,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Count._ Go, my sweet children! you must eat your supper before I do."
13251,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13252,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ Run into your own room for it.
13253,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13254,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Annabella._ I will not go until papa has patted me again on the
13255,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","shoulder, now I begin to remember it. I do not much mind the beard: I"
13256,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",grow used to it already: but indeed I liked better to stroke and pat
13257,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","the smooth laughing cheek, with my arm across the neck behind. It is"
13258,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",very pleasant even so. Am I not grown? I can put the whole length of
13259,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",my finger between your lips.
13260,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13261,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Count._ And now, will not _you_ come, Wilhelm?"
13262,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13263,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Wilhelm._ I am too tall and too heavy: she is but a child.
13264,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","[_Whispers._] Yet I think, papa, I am hardly so much of a man but you"
13265,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",may kiss me over again ... if you will not let her see it.
13266,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13267,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ My dears! why do not you go to your supper?
13268,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13269,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Annabella._ Because he has come to show us what Turks are like.
13270,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13271,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Wilhelm._ Do not be angry with her. Do not look down, papa!"
13272,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13273,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Count._ Blessings on you both, sweet children!"
13274,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13275,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Wilhelm._ We may go now.
13276,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13277,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Countess._ And now, Ludolph, come to the table, and tell me all your"
13278,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",sufferings.
13279,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13280,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Count._ The worst begin here.
13281,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13282,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ Ungrateful Ludolph!
13283,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13284,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Count._ I am he: that is my name in full.
13285,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13286,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ You have then ceased to love me?
13287,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13288,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Count._ Worse; if worse can be: I have ceased to deserve your love.
13289,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13290,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ No: Ludolph hath spoken falsely for once; but Ludolph is
13291,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",not false.
13292,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13293,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Count._ I have forfeited all I ever could boast of, your affection"
13294,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","and my own esteem. Away with caresses! Repulse me, abjure me; hate,"
13295,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",and never pardon me. Let the abject heart lie untorn by one remorse.
13296,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",Forgiveness would split and shiver what slavery but abased.
13297,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13298,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ Again you embrace me; and yet tell me never to pardon you!
13299,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",O inconsiderate man! O idle deviser of impossible things!
13300,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13301,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","But you have not introduced to me those who purchased your freedom, or"
13302,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",who achieved it by their valour.
13303,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13304,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Count._ Mercy! O God!
13305,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13306,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ Are they dead? Was the plague abroad.
13307,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13308,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Count._ I will not dissemble ... such was never my intention ... that
13309,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",my deliverance was brought about by means of----
13310,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13311,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ Say it at once ... a lady.
13312,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13313,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Count._ It was.
13314,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13315,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ She fled with you.
13316,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13317,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Count._ She did.
13318,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13319,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Countess._ And have you left her, sir?"
13320,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13321,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Count._ Alas! alas! I have not; and never can.
13322,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13323,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Countess._ Now come to my arms, brave, honourable Ludolph! Did I not"
13324,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","say thou couldst not be ungrateful? Where, where is she who has given"
13325,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",me back my husband?
13326,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13327,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Count._ Dare I utter it! in this house.
13328,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13329,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ Call the children.
13330,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13331,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Count._ No; they must not affront her: they must not even stare at
13332,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","her: other eyes, not theirs, must stab me to the heart."
13333,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13334,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ They shall bless her; we will all. Bring her in.
13335,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13336,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",[_Zaida is led in by the Count._]
13337,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13338,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ We three have stood silent long enough: and much there
13339,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","may be on which we will for ever keep silence. But, sweet young"
13340,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","creature! can I refuse my protection, or my love, to the preserver of"
13341,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","my husband? Can I think it a crime, or even a folly, to have pitied"
13342,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",the brave and the unfortunate? to have pressed (but alas! that it ever
13343,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",should have been so here!) a generous heart to a tender one?
13344,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13345,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",Why do you begin to weep?
13346,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13347,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Zaida._ Under your kindness, O lady, lie the sources of these tears."
13348,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13349,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",But why has he left us? He might help me to say many things which I
13350,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",want to say.
13351,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13352,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ Did he never tell you he was married?
13353,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13354,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Zaida._ He did indeed.
13355,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13356,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ That he had children?
13357,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13358,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Zaida._ It comforted me a little to hear it.
13359,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13360,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ Why? prithee why?
13361,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13362,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Zaida._ When I was in grief at the certainty of holding but the
13363,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","second place in his bosom, I thought I could at least go and play with"
13364,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","them, and win perhaps their love."
13365,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13366,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Countess._ According to our religion, a man must have only one wife."
13367,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13368,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Zaida._ That troubled me again. But the dispenser of your religion,"
13369,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","who binds and unbinds, does for sequins or services what our Prophet"
13370,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",does purely through kindness.
13371,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13372,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ We can love but one.
13373,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13374,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Zaida._ We indeed can love only one: but men have large hearts.
13375,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13376,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ Unhappy girl!
13377,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13378,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Zaida._ The very happiest in the world.
13379,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13380,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ Ah! inexperienced creature!
13381,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13382,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Zaida._ The happier for that perhaps.
13383,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13384,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ But the sin!
13385,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13386,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Zaida._ Where sin is, there must be sorrow: and I, my sweet sister,"
13387,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","feel none whatever. Even when tears fall from my eyes, they fall only"
13388,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",to cool my breast: I would not have one the fewer: they all are for
13389,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","him: whatever he does, whatever he causes, is dear to me."
13390,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13391,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ [_Aside._] This is too much. I could hardly endure to have
13392,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","him so beloved by another, even at the extremity of the earth. [_To"
13393,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",Zaida._] You would not lead him into perdition?
13394,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13395,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Zaida._ I have led him (Allah be praised!) to his wife and children.
13396,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",It was for those I left my father. He whom we love might have stayed
13397,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","with me at home: but there he would have been only half happy, even"
13398,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",had he been free. I could not often let him see me through the
13399,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",lattice; I was too afraid; and I dared only once let fall the
13400,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",water-melon; it made such a noise in dropping and rolling on the
13401,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","terrace: but, another day, when I had pared it nicely, and had swathed"
13402,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","it up well among vine-leaves, dipped in sugar and sherbet, I was quite"
13403,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",happy. I leaped and danced to have been so ingenious. I wonder what
13404,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","creature could have found and eaten it. I wish he were here, that I"
13405,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",might ask him if he knew.
13406,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13407,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ He quite forgot home then!
13408,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13409,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Zaida._ When we could speak together at all, he spoke perpetually of"
13410,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",those whom the calamity of war had separated from him.
13411,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13412,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","_Countess._ It appears that you could comfort him in his distress, and"
13413,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",did it willingly.
13414,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13415,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Zaida._ It is delightful to kiss the eye-lashes of the beloved: is it
13416,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",not? but never so delightful as when fresh tears are on them.
13417,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13418,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ And even this too? you did this?
13419,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13420,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Zaida._ Fifty times.
13421,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13422,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ Insupportable!
13423,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13424,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",He often then spoke about me?
13425,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13426,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Zaida._ As sure as ever we met: for he knew I loved him the better
13427,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",when I heard him speak so fondly.
13428,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",
13429,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",_Countess._ [_To herself._] Is this possible? It may be ... of the

13440,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",Impossible! impossible! [_To Zaida._] We are rich....
13441,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",

13454,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.",usual; nothing more. But he must swear that he has kissed it first.
13455,"THE COUNT GLEICHEM: THE COUNTESS: THEIR CHILDREN, AND ZAIDA.","No, he need not swear it; I may always see him do it, now."

13496,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13497,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Who is he that entered, and now steps so silently and"
13498,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"softly, yet with a foot so heavy it shakes my curtains?"
13499,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13500,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,Frate Biagio! can it possibly be you?
13501,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13502,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"No more physic for me, nor masses neither, at present."
13503,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13504,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,Assunta! Assuntina! who is it?
13505,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13506,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Assunta._ I cannot say, Signor Padrone! he puts his finger in the"
13507,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"dimple of his chin, and smiles to make me hold my tongue."
13508,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13509,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Fra Biagio! are you come from Samminiato for this? You
13510,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,need not put your finger there. We want no secrets. The girl knows her
13511,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"duty and does her business. I have slept well, and wake better."
13512,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,[_Raising himself up a little._]
13513,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13514,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,Why? who are you? It makes my eyes ache to look aslant over the
13515,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,sheets; and I cannot get to sit quite upright so conveniently; and I
13516,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"must not have the window-shutters opened, they tell me."
13517,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13518,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Dear Giovanni! have you then been very unwell?
13519,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13520,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ O that sweet voice! and this fat friendly hand of thine,"
13521,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,Francesco!
13522,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13523,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Thou hast distilled all the pleasantest flowers, and all the"
13524,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"wholesomest herbs of spring, into my breast already."
13525,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13526,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"What showers we have had this April, ay! How could you come along such"
13527,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"roads? If the devil were my labourer, I would make him work upon these"
13528,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,of Certaldo. He would have little time and little itch for mischief
13529,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"ere he had finished them, but would gladly fan himself with an"
13530,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Agnus-castus, and go to sleep all through the carnival."
13531,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13532,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Let us cease to talk both of the labour and the labourer.
13533,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,You have then been dangerously ill?
13534,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13535,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ I do not know: they told me I was: and truly a man might
13536,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"be unwell enough, who has twenty masses said for him, and fain sigh"
13537,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"when he thinks what he has paid for them. As I hope to be saved, they"
13538,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"cost me a lira each. Assunta is a good market-girl in eggs, and"
13539,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"mutton, and cow-heel; but I would not allow her to argue and haggle"
13540,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,about the masses. Indeed she knows best whether they were not fairly
13541,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"worth all that was asked for them, although I could have bought a"
13542,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"winter cloak for less money. However, we do not want both at the same"
13543,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"time. I did not want the cloak: I wanted _them_, it seems. And yet I"
13544,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"begin to think God would have had mercy on me, if I had begged it of"
13545,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,him myself in my own house. What think you?
13546,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13547,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ I think he might.
13548,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13549,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Particularly if I offered him the sacrifice on which I
13550,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,wrote to you.
13551,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13552,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ That letter has brought me hither.
13553,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13554,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ You do then insist on my fulfilling my promise, the"
13555,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,moment I can leave my bed. I am ready and willing.
13556,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13557,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ Promise! none was made. You only told me that, if it"
13558,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"pleased God to restore you to your health again, you are ready to"
13559,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,acknowledge His mercy by the holocaust of your _Decameron_. What proof
13560,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,have you that God would exact it? If you could destroy the _Inferno_
13561,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"of Dante, would you?"
13562,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13563,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Not I, upon my life! I would not promise to burn a copy"
13564,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,of it on the condition of a recovery for twenty years.
13565,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13566,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ You are the only author who would not rather demolish
13567,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,another's work than his own; especially if he thought it better: a
13568,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,thought which seldom goes beyond suspicion.
13569,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13570,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ I am not jealous of any one: I think admiration
13571,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"pleasanter. Moreover, Dante and I did not come forward at the same"
13572,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"time, nor take the same walks. His flames are too fierce for you and"
13573,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,me: we had trouble enough with milder. I never felt any high
13574,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,gratification in hearing of people being damned; and much less would I
13575,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,toss them into the fire myself. I might indeed have put a nettle under
13576,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the nose of the learned judge in Florence, when he banished you and"
13577,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,your family; but I hardly think I could have voted for more than a
13578,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,scourging to the foulest and fiercest of the party.
13579,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13580,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ Be as compassionate, be as amiably irresolute, toward your"
13581,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"own _Novelle_, which have injured no friend of yours, and deserve more"
13582,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,affection.
13583,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13584,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Francesco! no character I ever knew, ever heard of, or"
13585,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"ever feigned, deserves the same affection as you do; the tenderest"
13586,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"lover, the truest friend, the firmest patriot, and, rarest of glories!"
13587,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,the poet who cherishes another's fame as dearly as his own.
13588,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13589,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ If aught of this is true, let it be recorded of me that my"
13590,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"exhortations and entreaties have been successful, in preserving the"
13591,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"works of the most imaginative and creative genius that our Italy, or"
13592,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"indeed our world, hath in any age beheld."
13593,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13594,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ I would not destroy his poems, as I told you, or think I"
13595,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"told you. Even the worst of the Florentines, who in general keep only"
13596,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"one of God's commandments, keep it rigidly in regard to Dante--"
13597,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13598,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,Love them who curse you.
13599,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13600,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"He called them all scoundrels, with somewhat less courtesy than"
13601,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"cordiality, and less afraid of censure for veracity than adulation: he"
13602,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"sent their fathers to hell, with no inclination to separate the child"
13603,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,and parent: and now they are hugging him for it in his shroud! Would
13604,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,you ever have suspected them of being such lovers of justice?
13605,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13606,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,You must have mistaken my meaning; the thought never entered my head:
13607,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,the idea of destroying a single copy of Dante! And what effect would
13608,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"that produce? There must be fifty, or near it, in various parts of"
13609,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,Italy.
13610,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13611,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ I spoke of you.
13612,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13613,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Of me! My poetry is vile; I have already thrown into the
13614,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,fire all of it within my reach.
13615,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13616,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Poetry was not the question. We neither of us are such
13617,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"poets as we thought ourselves when we were younger, and as younger men"
13618,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,think us still. I meant your _Decameron_; in which there is more
13619,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"character, more nature, more invention, than either modern or ancient"
13620,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Italy, or than Greece, from whom she derived her whole inheritance,"
13621,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,ever claimed or ever knew. Would you consume a beautiful meadow
13622,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,because there are reptiles in it; or because a few grubs hereafter may
13623,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,be generated by the succulence of the grass?
13624,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13625,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ You amaze me: you utterly confound me.
13626,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13627,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ If you would eradicate twelve or thirteen of the
13628,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Novelle_, and insert the same number of better, which you could"
13629,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"easily do within as many weeks, I should be heartily glad to see it"
13630,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,done. Little more than a tenth of the _Decameron_ is bad: less than a
13631,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,twentieth of the _Divina Commedia_ is good.
13632,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13633,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ So little?
13634,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13635,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Let me never seem irreverent to our master.
13636,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13637,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Speak plainly and fearlessly, Francesco! Malice and"
13638,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,detraction are strangers to you.
13639,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13640,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Well then: at least sixteen parts in twenty of the
13641,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Inferno_ and _Purgatorio_ are detestable, both in poetry and"
13642,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,principle: the higher parts are excellent indeed.
13643,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13644,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ I have been reading the _Paradiso_ more recently. Here it
13645,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"is, under the pillow. It brings me happier dreams than the others, and"
13646,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,takes no more time in bringing them. Preparation for my lectures made
13647,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,me remember a great deal of the poem. I did not request my auditors to
13648,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,admire the beauty of the metrical version:
13649,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13650,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Osanna sanctus deus Sabbaoth,"
13651,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,Super-illustrans charitate tu√¢
13652,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Felices ignes horum Malahoth,"
13653,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13654,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"nor these, with a slip of Italian between two pales of Latin:"
13655,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13656,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Modicum,[14] et non videbitis me,"
13657,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Et iterum, sorelle mie dilette,"
13658,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Modicum, et vos videbitis me."
13659,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13660,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,I dare not repeat all I recollect of
13661,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13662,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Pepe Setan, Pepe Setan, aleppe,"
13663,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13664,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,as there is no holy-water-sprinkler in the room: and you are aware
13665,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"that other dangers awaited me, had I been so imprudent as to show the"
13666,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,Florentines the allusion of our poet. His _gergo_ is perpetually in
13667,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"play, and sometimes plays very roughly."
13668,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13669,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ We will talk again of him presently. I must now rejoice
13670,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"with you over the recovery and safety of your prodigal son, the"
13671,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Decameron_.
13672,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13673,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ So then, you would preserve at any rate my favourite"
13674,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,volume from the threatened conflagration.
13675,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13676,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ Had I lived at the time of Dante, I would have given him"
13677,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,the same advice in the same circumstances. Yet how different is the
13678,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,tendency of the two productions! Yours is somewhat too licentious; and
13679,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"young men, in whose nature, or rather in whose education and habits,"
13680,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"there is usually this failing, will read you with more pleasure than"
13681,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"is commendable or innocent. Yet the very time they occupy with you,"
13682,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,would perhaps be spent in the midst of those excesses or
13683,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"irregularities, to which the moralist, in his utmost severity, will"
13684,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,argue that your pen directs them. Now there are many who are fond of
13685,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"standing on the brink of precipices, and who nevertheless are as"
13686,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,cautious as any of falling in. And there are minds desirous of being
13687,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"warmed by description, which without this warmth might seek excitement"
13688,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,among the things described.
13689,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13690,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"I would not tell you in health what I tell you in convalescence, nor"
13691,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,urge you to compose what I dissuade you from cancelling. After this
13692,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"avowal, I do declare to you, Giovanni, that in my opinion, the very"
13693,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,idlest of your tales will do the world as much good as evil; not
13694,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"reckoning the pleasure of reading, nor the exercise and recreation of"
13695,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the mind, which in themselves are good. What I reprove you for, is the"
13696,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"indecorous and uncleanly; and these, I trust, you will abolish. Even"
13697,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"these, however, may repel from vice the ingenuous and graceful spirit,"
13698,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,and can never lead any such toward them. Never have you taken an
13699,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,inhuman pleasure in blunting and fusing the affections at the furnace
13700,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"of the passions; never, in hardening by sour sagacity and ungenial"
13701,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"strictures, that delicacy which is more productive of innocence and"
13702,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"happiness, more estranged from every track and tendency of their"
13703,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"opposites, than what in cold, crude systems hath holden the place and"
13704,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"dignity of the highest virtue. May you live, O my friend, in the"
13705,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"enjoyment of health, to substitute the facetious for the licentious,"
13706,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the simple for the extravagant, the true and characteristic for the"
13707,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,indefinite and diffuse.
13708,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13709,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,*       *       *       *       *
13710,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13711,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ And after all this, can you bear to think what I am?"
13712,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13713,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ Complacently and joyfully; venturing, nevertheless, to"
13714,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,offer you a friend's advice.
13715,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13716,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,Enter into the mind and heart of your own creatures: think of them
13717,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"long, entirely, solely: never of style, never of self, never of"
13718,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"critics, cracked or sound. Like the miles of an open country, and of"
13719,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"an ignorant population, when they are correctly measured they become"
13720,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,smaller. In the loftiest rooms and richest entablatures are suspended
13721,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,the most spider-webs; and the quarry out of which palaces are erected
13722,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,is the nursery of nettle and bramble.
13723,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13724,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ It is better to keep always in view such writers as
13725,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Cicero, than to run after those idlers who throw stones that can never"
13726,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,reach us.
13727,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13728,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ If you copied him to perfection, and on no occasion lost"
13729,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"sight of him, you would be an indifferent, not to say a bad writer."
13730,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13731,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ I begin to think you are in the right. Well then,"
13732,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"retrenching some of my licentious tales, I must endeavour to fill up"
13733,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,the vacancy with some serious and some pathetic.
13734,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13735,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ I am heartily glad to hear of this decision; for,"
13736,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"admirable as you are in the jocose, you descend from your natural"
13737,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,position when you come to the convivial and the festive. You were
13738,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"placed among the Affections, to move and master them, and gifted with"
13739,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,the rod that sweetens the fount of tears. My nature leads me also to
13740,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the pathetic; in which, however, an imbecile writer may obtain"
13741,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"celebrity. Even the hard-hearted are fond of such reading, when they"
13742,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,are fond of any; and nothing is easier in the world than to find and
13743,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,accumulate its sufferings. Yet this very profusion and luxuriance of
13744,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,misery is the reason why few have excelled in describing it. The eye
13745,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,wanders over the mass without noticing the peculiarities. To mark them
13746,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"distinctly is the work of genius; a work so rarely performed, that, if"
13747,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"time and space may be compared, specimens of it stand at wider"
13748,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,distances than the trophies of Sesostris. Here we return again to the
13749,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Inferno_ of Dante, who overcame the difficulty. In this vast desert"
13750,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,are its greater and its less oasis; Ugolino and Francesca di Rimini.
13751,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,The peopled region is peopled chiefly with monsters and moschitoes:
13752,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,the rest for the most part is sand and suffocation.
13753,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13754,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Ah! had Dante remained through life the pure solitary
13755,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"lover of Bice, his soul had been gentler, tranquiller, and more"
13756,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"generous. He scarcely hath described half the curses he went through,"
13757,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"nor the roads he took on the journey: theology, politics, and that"
13758,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"barbican of the _Inferno_, marriage, surrounded with its"
13759,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13760,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,Selva selvaggia ed aspra e forte.
13761,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13762,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Admirable is indeed the description of Ugolino, to whoever can endure"
13763,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,the sight of an old soldier gnawing at the scalp of an old archbishop.
13764,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13765,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ The thirty lines from
13766,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13767,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Ed io sentii,"
13768,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13769,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,are unequalled by any other continuous thirty in the whole dominions
13770,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,of poetry.
13771,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13772,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Give me rather the six on Francesca: for if in the former
13773,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"I find the simple, vigorous, clear narration, I find also what I would"
13774,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"not wish, the features of Ugolino reflected full in Dante. The two"
13775,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"characters are similar in themselves; hard, cruel, inflexible,"
13776,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"malignant, but, whenever moved, moved powerfully. In Francesca, with"
13777,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the faculty of divine spirits, he leaves his own nature (not indeed"
13778,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,the exact representative of theirs) and converts all his strength into
13779,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"tenderness. The great poet, like the original man of the Platonists,"
13780,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"is double, possessing the further advantage of being able to drop one"
13781,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"half at his option, and to resume it. Some of the tenderest on paper"
13782,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,have no sympathies beyond; and some of the austerest in their
13783,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,intercourse with their fellow-creatures have deluged the world with
13784,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"tears. It is not from the rose that the bee gathers her honey, but"
13785,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,often from the most acrid and the most bitter leaves and petals:
13786,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13787,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,Quando leggemmo il disiato viso
13788,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Esser baciato di cotanto amante,"
13789,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Questi, chi mai da me non sia diviso!"
13790,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,La bocca mi baci√≤ tutto tremante ...
13791,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Galeotto_ f√π il libro, e chi lo scrisse ..."
13792,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,Quel giorno pi√π non vi leggemmo avante.
13793,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13794,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"In the midst of her punishment, Francesca, when she comes to the"
13795,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"tenderest part of her story, tells it with complacency and delight;"
13796,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"and, instead of naming Paolo, which indeed she never has done from the"
13797,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"beginning, she now designates him as"
13798,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13799,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,Questi chi mai da me non sia diviso!
13800,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13801,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Are we not impelled to join in her prayer, wishing them happier in"
13802,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,their union?
13803,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13804,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ If there be no sin in it.
13805,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13806,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Ay, and even if there be ... God help us!"
13807,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13808,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,What a sweet aspiration in each cesura of the verse! three love-sighs
13809,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"fixed and incorporate! Then, when she hath said"
13810,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13811,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"La bocca mi baci√≤, tutto tremante,"
13812,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13813,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,she stops: she would avert the eyes of Dante from her: he looks for
13814,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,the sequel: she thinks he looks severely: she says: '_Galeotto_ is the
13815,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"name of the book,' fancying by this timorous little flight she has"
13816,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"drawn him far enough from the nest of her young loves. No, the eagle"
13817,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,beak of Dante and his piercing eyes are yet over her.
13818,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13819,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,'_Galeotto_ is the name of the book.'
13820,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13821,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,'What matters that?'
13822,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13823,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,'And of the writer.'
13824,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13825,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,'Or that either?'
13826,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13827,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,At last she disarms him: but how?
13828,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13829,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,'_That_ day we read no more.'
13830,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13831,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Such a depth of intuitive judgment, such a delicacy of perception,"
13832,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"exists not in any other work of human genius; and from an author who,"
13833,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"on almost all occasions, in this part of the work, betrays a"
13834,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,deplorable want of it.
13835,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13836,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Perfection of poetry! The greater is my wonder at
13837,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,discovering nothing else of the same order or cast in this whole
13838,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"section of the poem. He who fainted at the recital of Francesca,"
13839,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13840,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"And he who fell as a dead body falls,"
13841,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13842,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,would exterminate all the inhabitants of every town in Italy! What
13843,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"execrations against Florence, Pistoia, Siena, Pisa, Genoa! what hatred"
13844,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,against the whole human race! what exultation and merriment at eternal
13845,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"and immitigable sufferings! Seeing this, I cannot but consider the"
13846,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Inferno_ as the most immoral and impious book that ever was written.
13847,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Yet, hopeless that our country shall ever see again such poetry, and"
13848,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,certain that without it our future poets would be more feebly urged
13849,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"forward to excellence, I would have dissuaded Dante from cancelling"
13850,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"it, if this had been his intention. Much however as I admire his"
13851,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"vigour and severity of style in the description of Ugolino, I"
13852,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"acknowledge with you that I do not discover so much imagination, so"
13853,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"much creative power, as in the Francesca. I find indeed a minute"
13854,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,detail of probable events: but this is not all I want in a poet: it is
13855,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"not even all I want most in a scene of horror. Tribunals of justice,"
13856,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"dens of murderers, wards of hospitals, schools of anatomy, will afford"
13857,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"us nearly the same sensations, if we hear them from an accurate"
13858,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"observer, a clear reporter, a skilful surgeon, or an attentive nurse."
13859,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"There is nothing of sublimity in the horrific of Dante, which there"
13860,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"always is in Aeschylus and Homer. If you, Giovanni, had described so"
13861,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"nakedly the reception of Guiscardo's heart by Gismonda, or Lorenzo's"
13862,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"head by Lisabetta, we could hardly have endured it."
13863,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13864,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Prithee, dear Francesco, do not place me over Dante: I"
13865,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,stagger at the idea of approaching him.
13866,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13867,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Never think I am placing you blindly or indiscriminately.
13868,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"I have faults to find with you, and even here. Lisabetta should by no"
13869,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"means have been represented cutting off the head of her lover, '_as"
13870,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"well as she could_,' with a clasp-knife. This is shocking and"
13871,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"improbable. She might have found it already cut off by her brothers,"
13872,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,in order to bury the corpse more commodiously and expeditiously. Nor
13873,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,indeed is it likely that she should have entrusted it to her
13874,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"waiting-maid, who carried home in her bosom a treasure so dear to her,"
13875,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,and found so unexpectedly and so lately.
13876,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13877,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ That is true: I will correct the oversight. Why do we
13878,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"never hear of our faults until everybody knows them, and until they"
13879,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,stand in record against us?
13880,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13881,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Because our ears are closed to truth and friendship for
13882,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,some time after the triumphal course of composition. We are too
13883,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,sensitive for the gentlest touch; and when we really have the most
13884,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"infirmity, we are angry to be told that we have any."
13885,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13886,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Ah, Francesco! thou art poet from scalp to heel: but what"
13887,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,other would open his breast as thou hast done! They show
13888,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,ostentatiously far worse weaknesses; but the most honest of the tribe
13889,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"would forswear himself on this. Again, I acknowledge it, you have"
13890,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,reason to complain of Lisabetta and Gismonda.
13891,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13892,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,*       *       *       *       *
13893,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13894,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ In my delight to listen to you after so long an absence, I"
13895,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,have been too unwary; and you have been speaking too much for one
13896,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"infirm. Greatly am I to blame, not to have moderated my pleasure and"
13897,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,your vivacity. You must rest now: to-morrow we will renew our
13898,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,conversation.
13899,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13900,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ God bless thee, Francesco! I shall be talking with thee"
13901,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,all night in my slumbers. Never have I seen thee with such pleasure as
13902,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"to-day, excepting when I was deemed worthy by our fellow-citizens of"
13903,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"bearing to thee, and of placing within this dear hand of thine, the"
13904,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"sentence of recall from banishment, and when my tears streamed over"
13905,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the ordinance as I read it, whereby thy paternal lands were redeemed"
13906,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,from the public treasury.
13907,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13908,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,Again God bless thee! Those tears were not quite exhausted: take the
13909,FIRST DAY'S INTERVIEW,last of them.

13922,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"It being now the Lord's day, Messer Francesco thought it meet that he"
13923,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"should rise early in the morning and bestir himself, to hear mass in"
13924,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the parish church at Certaldo. Whereupon he went on tiptoe, if so"
13925,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"weighty a man could indeed go in such a fashion, and lifted softly the"
13926,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"latch of Ser Giovanni's chamber door, that he might salute him ere he"
13927,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"departed, and occasion no wonder at the step he was about to take. He"
13928,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"found Ser Giovanni fast asleep, with the missal wide open across his"
13929,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"nose, and a pleasant smile on his genial, joyous mouth. Ser Francesco"
13930,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"leaned over the couch, closed his hands together, and looking with"
13931,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"even more than his usual benignity, said in a low voice:"
13932,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13933,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'God bless thee, gentle soul! the mother of purity and innocence"
13934,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,protect thee!'
13935,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13936,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"He then went into the kitchen, where he found the girl Assunta, and"
13937,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,mentioned his resolution. She informed him that the horse had eaten
13938,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"his two beans,[15] and was as strong as a lion and as ready as a"
13939,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"lover. Ser Francesco patted her on the cheek, and called her"
13940,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_semplicetta_! She was overjoyed at this honour from so great a man,"
13941,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the bosom friend of her good master, whom she had always thought the"
13942,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"greatest man in the world, not excepting Monsignore, until he told her"
13943,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,he was only a dog confronted with Ser Francesco. She tripped alertly
13944,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"across the paved court into the stable, and took down the saddle and"
13945,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"bridle from the farther end of the rack. But Ser Francesco, with his"
13946,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"natural politeness, would not allow her to equip his palfrey."
13947,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13948,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'This is not the work for maidens,' said he; 'return to the house,"
13949,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,good girl!'
13950,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13951,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"She lingered a moment, then went away; but, mistrusting the dexterity"
13952,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"of Ser Francesco, she stopped and turned back again, and peeped"
13953,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"through the half-closed door, and heard sundry sobs and wheezes round"
13954,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"about the girth. Ser Francesco's wind ill seconded his intention; and,"
13955,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,although he had thrown the saddle valiantly and stoutly in its
13956,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"station, yet the girths brought him into extremity. She entered again,"
13957,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"and dissembling the reason, asked him whether he would not take a"
13958,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"small beaker of the sweet white wine before he set out, and offered to"
13959,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,girdle the horse while his Reverence bitted and bridled him. Before
13960,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"any answer could be returned, she had begun. And having now"
13961,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"satisfactorily executed her undertaking, she felt irrepressible"
13962,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,delight and glee at being able to do what Ser Francesco had failed in.
13963,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,He was scarcely more successful with his allotment of the labour;
13964,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"found unlooked-for intricacies and complications in the machinery,"
13965,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"wondered that human wit could not simplify it, and declared that the"
13966,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"animal had never exhibited such restiveness before. In fact, he never"
13967,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"had experienced the same grooming. At this conjuncture, a green cap"
13968,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"made its appearance, bound with straw-coloured ribbon, and surmounted"
13969,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"with two bushy sprigs of hawthorn, of which the globular buds were"
13970,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"swelling, and some bursting, but fewer yet open. It was young"
13971,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Simplizio Nardi, who sometimes came on the Sunday morning to sweep the"
13972,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,courtyard for Assunta.
13973,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13974,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Oh! this time you are come just when you were wanted,' said the girl."
13975,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13976,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Bridle, directly, Ser Francesco's horse, and then go away about your"
13977,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,business.'
13978,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13979,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"The youth blushed, and kissed Ser Francesco's hand, begging his"
13980,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,permission. It was soon done. He then held the stirrup; and Ser
13981,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Francesco, with scarcely three efforts, was seated and erect on the"
13982,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"saddle. The horse, however, had somewhat more inclination for the"
13983,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"stable than for the expedition; and, as Assunta was handing to the"
13984,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"rider his long ebony staff, bearing an ivory caduceus, the quadruped"
13985,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"turned suddenly round. Simplizio called him _bestiaccia_! and then,"
13986,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"softening it, _poco garbato_! and proposed to Ser Francesco that he"
13987,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"should leave the bastone behind, and take the crab-switch he presented"
13988,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"to him, giving at the same time a sample of its efficacy, which"
13989,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,covered the long grizzle hair of the worthy quadruped with a profusion
13990,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"of pink blossoms, like embroidery. The offer was declined; but Assunta"
13991,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"told Simplizio to carry it himself, and to walk by the side of Ser"
13992,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Canonico quite up to the church porch, having seen what a sad,"
13993,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,dangerous beast his reverence had under him.
13994,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13995,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"With perfect good will, partly in the pride of obedience to Assunta,"
13996,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"and partly to enjoy the renown of accompanying a canon of Holy Church,"
13997,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Simplizio did as she enjoined.
13998,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
13999,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"And now the sound of village bells, in many hamlets and convents and"
14000,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"churches out of sight, was indistinctly heard, and lost again; and at"
14001,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,last the five of Certaldo seemed to crow over the faintness of them
14002,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,all. The freshness of the morning was enough of itself to excite the
14003,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,spirits of youth; a portion of which never fails to descend on years
14004,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"that are far removed from it, if the mind has partaken in innocent"
14005,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,mirth while it was its season and its duty to enjoy it. Parties of
14006,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"young and old passed the canonico and his attendant with mute respect,"
14007,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,bowing and bare-headed; for that ebony staff threw its spell over the
14008,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"tongue, which the frank and hearty salutation of the bearer was"
14009,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"inadequate to break. Simplizio, once or twice, attempted to call back"
14010,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,an intimate of the same age with himself; but the utmost he could
14011,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,obtain was a _riveritissimo_! and a genuflexion to the rider. It is
14012,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,reported that a heart-burning rose up from it in the breast of a
14013,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"cousin, some days after, too distinctly apparent in the long-drawn"
14014,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,appellation of _Gnor_[16] Simplizio.
14015,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14016,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Ser Francesco moved gradually forward, his steed picking his way along"
14017,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the lane, and looking fixedly on the stones with all the sobriety of a"
14018,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"mineralogist. He himself was well satisfied with the pace, and told"
14019,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Simplizio to be sparing of the switch, unless in case of a hornet or a"
14020,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"gadfly. Simplizio smiled, toward the hedge, and wondered at the"
14021,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"condescension of so great a theologian and astrologer, in joking with"
14022,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,him about the gadflies and hornets in the beginning of April. 'Ah!
14023,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,there are men in the world who can make wit out of anything!' said he
14024,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,to himself.
14025,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14026,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"As they approached the walls of the town, the whole country was"
14027,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,pervaded by a stirring and diversified air of gladness. Laughter and
14028,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"songs and flutes and viols, inviting voices and complying responses,"
14029,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"mingled with merry bells and with processional hymns, along the"
14030,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,woodland paths and along the yellow meadows. It was really the _Lord's
14031,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Day_, for He made His creatures happy in it, and their hearts were"
14032,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,thankful. Even the cruel had ceased from cruelty; and the rich man
14033,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,alone exacted from the animal his daily labour. Ser Francesco made
14034,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"this remark, and told his youthful guide that he had never been before"
14035,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,where he could not walk to church on a Sunday; and that nothing should
14036,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"persuade him to urge the speed of his beast, on the seventh day,"
14037,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,beyond his natural and willing foot's-pace. He reached the gates of
14038,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Certaldo more than half an hour before the time of service, and he"
14039,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"found laurels suspended over them, and being suspended; and many"
14040,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,pleasant and beautiful faces were protruded between the ranks of
14041,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,gentry and clergy who awaited him. Little did he expect such an
14042,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"attendance; but Fra Biagio of San Vivaldo, who himself had offered no"
14043,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"obsequiousness or respect, had scattered the secret of his visit"
14044,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"throughout the whole country. A young poet, the most celebrated in the"
14045,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"town, approached the canonico with a long scroll of verses, which fell"
14046,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"below the knee, beginning:"
14047,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14048,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,How shall we welcome our illustrious guest?
14049,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14050,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,To which Ser Francesco immediately replied: 'Take your favourite
14051,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"maiden, lead the dance with her, and bid all your friends follow; you"
14052,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,have a good half-hour for it.'
14053,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14054,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Universal applauses succeeded, the music struck up, couples were"
14055,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,instantly formed. The gentry on this occasion led out the
14056,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"cittadinanza, as they usually do in the villeggiatura, rarely in the"
14057,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"carnival, and never at other times. The elder of the priests stood"
14058,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"round in their sacred vestments, and looked with cordiality and"
14059,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"approbation on the youths, whose hands and arms could indeed do much,"
14060,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"and did it, but whose active eyes could rarely move upward the"
14061,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,modester of their partners.
14062,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14063,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,While the elder of the clergy were thus gathering the fruits of their
14064,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"liberal cares and paternal exhortations, some of the younger looked on"
14065,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"with a tenderer sentiment, not unmingled with regret. Suddenly the"
14066,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,bells ceased; the figure of the dance was broken; all hastened into
14067,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the church; and many hands that joined on the green, met together at"
14068,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the font, and touched the brow reciprocally with its lustral waters,"
14069,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,in soul-devotion.
14070,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14071,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"After the service, and after a sermon a good church-hour in length to"
14072,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"gratify him, enriched with compliments from all authors, Christian and"
14073,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Pagan, informing him at the conclusion that, although he had been"
14074,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"crowned in the Capitol, he must die, being born mortal, Ser Francesco"
14075,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"rode homeward. The sermon seemed to have sunk deeply into him, and"
14076,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"even into the horse under him, for both of them nodded, both snorted,"
14077,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,and one stumbled. Simplizio was twice fain to cry:
14078,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14079,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,'Ser Canonico! Riverenza! in this country if we sleep before dinner it
14080,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"does us harm. There are stones in the road, Ser Canonico, loose as"
14081,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"eggs in a nest, and pretty nigh as thick together, huge as mountains.'"
14082,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14083,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Good lad!' said Ser Francesco, rubbing his eyes, 'toss the biggest of"
14084,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"them out of the way, and never mind the rest.'"
14085,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14086,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"The horse, although he walked, shuffled almost into an amble as he"
14087,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"approached the stable, and his master looked up at it with nearly the"
14088,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"same contentment. Assunta had been ordered to wait for his return, and"
14089,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,cried:
14090,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14091,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'O Ser Francesco! you are looking at our long apricot, that runs the"
14092,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"whole length of the stable and barn, covered with blossoms as the old"
14093,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"white hen is with feathers. You must come in the summer, and eat this"
14094,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,fine fruit with Signor Padrone. You cannot think how ruddy and golden
14095,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"and sweet and mellow it is. There are peaches in all the fields, and"
14096,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"plums, and pears, and apples, but there is not another apricot for"
14097,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,miles and miles. Ser Giovanni brought the stone from Naples before I
14098,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,was born: a lady gave it to him when she had eaten only half the fruit
14099,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"off it: but perhaps you may have seen her, for you have ridden as far"
14100,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"as Rome, or beyond. Padrone looks often at the fruit, and eats it"
14101,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"willingly; and I have seen him turn over the stones in his plate, and"
14102,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"choose one out from the rest, and put it into his pocket, but never"
14103,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,plant it.'
14104,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14105,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,'Where is the youth?' inquired Ser Francesco.
14106,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14107,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Gone away,' answered the maiden."
14108,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14109,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'I wanted to thank him,' said the Canonico."
14110,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14111,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,'May I tell him so?' asked she.
14112,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14113,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'And give him ...' continued he, holding a piece of silver."
14114,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14115,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'I will give him something of my own, if he goes on and behaves well,'"
14116,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"said she; 'but Signor Padrone would drive him away for ever, I am"
14117,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"sure, if he were tempted in an evil hour to accept a quattrino for any"
14118,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,service he could render the friends of the house.'
14119,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14120,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Ser Francesco was delighted with the graceful animation of this
14121,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"ingenuous girl, and asked her, with a little curiosity, how she could"
14122,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,afford to make him a present.
14123,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14124,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'I do not intend to make him a present,' she replied: 'but it is"
14125,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"better he should be rewarded by me,' she blushed and hesitated, 'or by"
14126,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Signor Padrone,' she added, 'than by your reverence. He has not done"
14127,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,half his duty yet; not half. I will teach him: he is quite a child;
14128,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,four months younger than me.'
14129,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14130,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Ser Francesco went into the house, saying to himself at the doorway:"
14131,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14132,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Truth, innocence, and gentle manners have not yet left the earth."
14133,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,There are sermons that never make the ears weary. I have heard but few
14134,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"of them, and come from church for this.'"
14135,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14136,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Whether Simplizio had obeyed some private signal from Assunta, or"
14137,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"whether his own delicacy had prompted him to disappear, he was now"
14138,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"again in the stable, and the manger was replenished with hay. A bucket"
14139,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,was soon after heard ascending from the well; and then two words:
14140,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Thanks, Simplizio.'"
14141,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14142,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"When Petrarca entered the chamber, he found Boccaccio with his"
14143,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"breviary in his hand, not looking into it indeed, but repeating a"
14144,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,thanksgiving in an audible and impassioned tone of voice. Seeing Ser
14145,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Francesco, he laid the book down beside him, and welcomed him."
14146,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14147,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'I hope you have an appetite after your ride,' said he, 'for you have"
14148,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,sent home a good dinner before you.'
14149,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14150,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Ser Francesco did not comprehend him, and expressed it not in words"
14151,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,but in looks.
14152,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14153,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,'I am afraid you will dine sadly late to-day: noon has struck this
14154,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"half-hour, and you must wait another, I doubt. However, by good luck,"
14155,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"I had a couple of citrons in the house, intended to assuage my thirst"
14156,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"if the fever had continued. This being over, by God's mercy, I will"
14157,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,try (please God!) whether we two greyhounds cannot be a match for a
14158,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,leveret.'
14159,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14160,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,'How is this?' said Ser Francesco.
14161,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14162,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Young Marc-Antonio Grilli, the cleverest lad in the parish at noosing"
14163,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"any wild animal, is our patron of the feast. He has wanted for many a"
14164,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,day to say something in the ear of Matilda Vercelli. Bringing up the
14165,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"leveret to my bedside, and opening the lips, and cracking the"
14166,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"knuckles, and turning the foot round to show the quality and quantity"
14167,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"of the hair upon it, and to prove that it really and truly was a"
14168,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"leveret, and might be eaten without offence to my teeth, he informed"
14169,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"me that he had left his mother in the yard, ready to dress it for me;"
14170,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,she having been cook to the prior. He protested he owed the _crowned
14171,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"martyr_ a forest of leverets, boars, deers, and everything else within"
14172,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"them, for having commanded the most backward girls to dance directly."
14173,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Whereupon he darted forth at Matilda, saying, ""The _crowned martyr_"
14174,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"orders it,"" seizing both her hands, and swinging her round before she"
14175,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,knew what she was about. He soon had an opportunity of applying a
14176,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"word, no doubt as dexterously as hand or foot; and she said"
14177,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"submissively, but seriously, and almost sadly, ""Marc-Antonio, now all"
14178,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the people have seen it, they will think it."""
14179,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14180,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,'And after a pause:
14181,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14182,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'""I am quite ashamed: and so should you be: are not you now?"""
14183,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14184,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'The others had run into the church. Matilda, who scarcely had noticed"
14185,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"it, cried suddenly:"
14186,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14187,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'""O Santissima! we are quite alone."""
14188,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14189,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'""Will you be mine?"" cried he, enthusiastically."
14190,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14191,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'""Oh! they will hear you in the church,"" replied she."
14192,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14193,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'""They shall, they shall,"" cried he again, as loudly."
14194,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14195,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'""If you will only go away."""
14196,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14197,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'""And then?"""
14198,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14199,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'""Yes, yes, indeed."""
14200,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14201,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'""The Virgin hears you: fifty saints are witnesses."""
14202,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14203,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'""Ah! they know you made me: they will look kindly on us."""
14204,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14205,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'He released her hand: she ran into the church, doubling her veil (I"
14206,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"will answer for her) at the door, and kneeling as near it as she could"
14207,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,find a place.
14208,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14209,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'""By St. Peter,"" said Marc-Antonio, ""if there is a leveret in the"
14210,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"wood, the _crowned martyr_ shall dine upon it this blessed day."" And"
14211,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"he bounded off, and set about his occupation. I inquired what induced"
14212,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"him to designate you by such a title. He answered, that everybody knew"
14213,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"you had received the crown of martyrdom at Rome, between the pope and"
14214,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"antipope, and had performed many miracles, for which they had"
14215,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"canonized you, and that you wanted only to die to become a saint.'"
14216,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14217,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"The leveret was now served up, cut into small pieces, and covered with"
14218,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"a rich tenacious sauce, composed of sugar, citron, and various spices."
14219,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,The appetite of Ser Francesco was contagious. Never was dinner more
14220,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"enjoyed by two companions, and never so much by a greater number. One"
14221,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"glass of a fragrant wine, the colour of honey, and unmixed with water,"
14222,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"crowned the repast. Ser Francesco then went into his own chamber, and"
14223,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"found, on his ample mattress, a cool, refreshing sleep, quite"
14224,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,sufficient to remove all the fatigues of the morning; and Ser Giovanni
14225,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"lowered the pillow against which he had seated himself, and fell into"
14226,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"his usual repose. Their separation was not of long continuance: and,"
14227,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the religious duties of the Sabbath having been performed, a few"
14228,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,reflections on literature were no longer interdicted.
14229,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14230,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,*       *       *       *       *
14231,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14232,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ The land, O Giovanni, of your early youth, the land of my"
14233,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"only love, fascinates us no longer. Italy is our country; and not ours"
14234,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"only, but every man's, wherever may have been his wanderings, wherever"
14235,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"may have been his birth, who watches with anxiety the recovery of the"
14236,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Arts, and acknowledges the supremacy of Genius. Besides, it is in"
14237,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Italy at last that all our few friends are resident. Yours were left
14238,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"behind you at Paris in your adolescence, if indeed any friendship can"
14239,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,exist between a Florentine and a Frenchman: mine at Avignon were
14240,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Italians, and older for the most part than myself. Here we know that"
14241,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"we are beloved by some, and esteemed by many. It indeed gave me"
14242,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"pleasure the first morning as I lay in bed, to overhear the fondness"
14243,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,and earnestness which a worthy priest was expressing in your behalf.
14244,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14245,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ In mine?
14246,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14247,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Yes indeed: what wonder?
14248,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14249,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ A worthy priest?
14250,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14251,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ None else, certainly."
14252,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14253,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Heard in bed! dreaming, dreaming; ay?"
14254,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14255,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ No indeed: my eyes and ears were wide open.
14256,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14257,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ The little parlour opens into your room. But what priest
14258,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,could that be? Canonico Casini? He only comes when we have a roast of
14259,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"thrushes, or some such small matter, at table: and this is not the"
14260,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,season; they are pairing. Plover eggs might tempt him hitherward. If
14261,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"he heard a plover he would not be easy, and would fain make her drop"
14262,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,her oblation before she had settled her nest.
14263,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14264,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ It is right and proper that you should be informed who the
14265,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"clergyman was, to whom you are under an obligation."
14266,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14267,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Tell me something about it, for truly I am at a loss to"
14268,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,conjecture.
14269,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14270,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ He must unquestionably have been expressing a kind and
14271,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,ardent solicitude for your eternal welfare. The first words I heard on
14272,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,awakening were these:
14273,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14274,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Ser Giovanni, although the best of masters ...'"
14275,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14276,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Those were Assuntina's.
14277,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14278,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ '... may hardly be quite so holy (not being priest or
14279,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,friar) as your Reverence.'
14280,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14281,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,She was interrupted by the question: 'What conversation holdeth he?'
14282,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14283,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,She answered:
14284,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14285,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'He never talks of loving our neighbour with all our heart, all our"
14286,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"soul, and all our strength, although he often gives away the last loaf"
14287,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,in the pantry.'
14288,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14289,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ It was she! Why did she say that? the slut!
14290,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14291,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ 'He doth well,' replied the confessor. 'Of the Church, of"
14292,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the brotherhood, that is, of me, what discourses holdeth he?'"
14293,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14294,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,I thought the question an indiscreet one; but confessors vary in their
14295,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,advances to the seat of truth.
14296,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14297,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,She proceeded to answer:
14298,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14299,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'He never said anything about the power of the Church to absolve us,"
14300,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"if we should happen to go astray a little in good company, like your"
14301,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Reverence.'
14302,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14303,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Here, it is easy to perceive, is some slight ambiguity. Evidently she"
14304,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"meant to say, by the seduction of 'bad' company, and to express that"
14305,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,his Reverence had asserted his power of absolution; which is
14306,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,undeniable.
14307,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14308,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ I have my version.
14309,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14310,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ What may yours be?
14311,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14312,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Frate Biagio; broad as daylight; the whole frock round!
14313,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14314,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"I would wager a flask of oil against a turnip, that he laid another"
14315,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"trap for a penance. Let us see how he went on. I warrant, as he"
14316,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"warmed, he left off limping in his paces, and bore hard upon the"
14317,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,bridle.
14318,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14319,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ 'Much do I fear,' continued the expositor, 'he never spoke"
14320,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"to thee, child, about another world.'"
14321,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14322,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,There was a silence of some continuance.
14323,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14324,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,'Speak!' said the confessor.
14325,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14326,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'No indeed he never did, poor Padrone!' was the slow and evidently"
14327,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"reluctant avowal of the maiden; for, in the midst of the"
14328,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"acknowledgment her sighs came through the crevices of the door: then,"
14329,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"without any farther interrogation, and with little delay, she added:"
14330,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14331,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,'But he often makes this look like it.'
14332,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14333,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ And now, if he had carried a holy scourge, it would not"
14334,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,have been on his shoulders that he would have laid it.
14335,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14336,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Zeal carries men often too far afloat; and confessors in
14337,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,general wish to have the sole steerage of the conscience. When she
14338,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"told him that your benignity made this world another heaven, he warmly"
14339,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,and sharply answered:
14340,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14341,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,'It is only we who ought to do that.'
14342,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14343,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Hush,' said the maiden; and I verily believe she at that moment set"
14344,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"her back against the door, to prevent the sounds from coming through"
14345,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the crevices, for the rest of them seemed to be just over my"
14346,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"night-cap. 'Hush,' said she, in the whole length of that softest of"
14347,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,all articulations. 'There is Ser Francesco in the next room: he sleeps
14348,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"long into the morning, but he is so clever a clerk, he may understand"
14349,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,you just the same. I doubt whether he thinks Ser Giovanni in the wrong
14350,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"for making so many people quite happy; and if he should, it would"
14351,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,grieve me very much to think he blamed Ser Giovanni.'
14352,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14353,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Who is Ser Francesco?' he asked, in a low voice."
14354,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14355,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Ser Canonico,' she answered."
14356,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14357,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,'Of what Duomo?' continued he.
14358,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14359,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Who knows?' was the reply; 'but he is Padrone's heart's friend, for"
14360,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,certain.'
14361,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14362,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,'Cospetto di Bacco! It can then be no other than Petrarca. He makes
14363,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"rhymes and love like the devil. Don't listen to him, or you are"
14364,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"undone. Does he love you too, as well as Padrone?' he asked, still"
14365,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,lowering his voice.
14366,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14367,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'I cannot tell that matter,' she answered, somewhat impatiently; 'but"
14368,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,I love him.'
14369,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14370,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'To my face!' cried he, smartly."
14371,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14372,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'To the Santissima!' replied she, instantaneously; 'for have not I"
14373,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,told your Reverence he is Padrone's true heart's friend! And are not
14374,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"you my confessor, when you come on purpose?'"
14375,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14376,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'True, true!' answered he; 'but there are occasions when we are"
14377,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"shocked by the confession, and wish it made less daringly.'"
14378,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14379,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,'I was bold; but who can help loving him who loves my good Padrone?'
14380,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"said she, much more submissively."
14381,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14382,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Brave girl, for that!"
14383,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14384,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Dog of a Frate! They are all of a kidney; all of a kennel. I would
14385,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,dilute their meal well and keep them low. They should not waddle and
14386,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"wallop in every hollow lane, nor loll out their watery tongues at"
14387,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"every wash-pool in the parish. We shall hear, I trust, no more about"
14388,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Fra Biagio in the house while you are with us. Ah! were it then for
14389,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,life.
14390,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14391,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ The man's prudence may be reasonably doubted, but it were"
14392,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"uncharitable to question his sincerity. Could a neighbour, a religious"
14393,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"one in particular, be indifferent to the welfare of Boccaccio, or any"
14394,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,belonging to him?
14395,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14396,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ I do not complain of his indifference. Indifferent! no,"
14397,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"not he. He might as well be, though. My villetta here is my castle: it"
14398,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,was my father's; it was his father's. Cowls did not hang to dry upon
14399,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,the same cord with caps in their podere; they shall not in mine. The
14400,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"girl is an honest girl, Francesco, though I say it. Neither she nor"
14401,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,any other shall be befooled and bamboozled under my roof. Methinks
14402,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Holy Church might contrive some improvement upon confession.
14403,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14404,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ Hush! Giovanni! But, it being a matter of discipline, who"
14405,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,knows but she might.
14406,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14407,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Discipline! ay, ay, ay! faith and troth there are some"
14408,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,who want it.
14409,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14410,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ You really terrify me. These are sad surmises.
14411,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14412,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Sad enough: but I am keeper of my handmaiden's probity.
14413,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14414,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ It could not be kept safer.
14415,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14416,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ I wonder what the Frate would be putting into her head?
14417,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14418,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ Nothing, nothing: be assured."
14419,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14420,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Why did he ask her all those questions?
14421,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14422,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Confessors do occasionally take circuitous ways to arrive
14423,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,at the secrets of the human heart.
14424,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14425,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ And sometimes they drive at it, me thinks, a whit too"
14426,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,directly. He had no business to make remarks about me.
14427,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14428,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Anxiety.
14429,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14430,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ 'Fore God, Francesco, he shall have more of that; for I"
14431,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"will shut him out the moment I am again up and stirring, though he"
14432,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,stand but a nose's length off. I have no fear about the girl; no
14433,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"suspicion of her. He might whistle to the moon on a frosty night, and"
14434,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,expect as reasonably her descending. Never was a man so entirely at
14435,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"his ease as I am about that; never, never. She is adamant; a bright"
14436,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,sword now first unscabbarded; no breath can hang about it. A seal of
14437,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"beryl, of chrysolite, of ruby; to make impressions (all in good time"
14438,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"and proper place though) and receive none: incapable, just as they"
14439,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"are, of splitting, or cracking, or flawing, or harbouring dirt. Let"
14440,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"him mind that. Such, I assure you, is that poor little wench,"
14441,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Assuntina.
14442,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14443,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ I am convinced that so well-behaved a young creature as
14444,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Assunta----
14445,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14446,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Right! Assunta is her name by baptism; we usually call
14447,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"her Assuntina, because she is slender, and scarcely yet full-grown,"
14448,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,perhaps: but who can tell?
14449,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14450,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"As for those friars, I never was a friend to impudence: I hate loose"
14451,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,suggestions. In girls' minds you will find little dust but what is
14452,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,carried there by gusts from without. They seldom want sweeping; when
14453,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"they do, the broom should be taken from behind the house door, and the"
14454,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,master should be the sacristan.
14455,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14456,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,... Scarcely were these words uttered when Assunta was heard running
14457,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,up the stairs; and the next moment she rapped. Being ordered to come
14458,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"in, she entered with a willow twig in her hand, from the middle of"
14459,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"which willow twig (for she held the two ends together) hung a fish,"
14460,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,shining with green and gold.
14461,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14462,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'What hast there, young maiden?' said Ser Francesco."
14463,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14464,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'A fish, Riverenza!' answered she. 'In Tuscany we call it _tinca_.'"
14465,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14466,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ I too am a little of a Tuscan.
14467,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14468,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Assunta._ Indeed! well, you really speak very like one, but only more"
14469,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,sweetly and slowly. I wonder how you can keep up with Signor
14470,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Padrone--he talks fast when he is in health; and you have made him so.
14471,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Why did not you come before? Your Reverence has surely been at
14472,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Certaldo in time past.
14473,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14474,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ Yes, before thou wert born."
14475,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14476,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Assunta._ Ah, sir! it must have been long ago then."
14477,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14478,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Thou hast just entered upon life.
14479,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14480,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ I am no child.
14481,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14482,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ What then art thou?
14483,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14484,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ I know not: I have lost both father and mother; there is a
14485,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,name for such as I am.
14486,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14487,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ And a place in heaven.
14488,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14489,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Who brought us that fish, Assunta? hast paid for it?"
14490,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,there must be seven pounds: I never saw the like.
14491,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14492,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ I could hardly lift up my apron to my eyes with it in my
14493,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"hand. Luca, who brought it all the way from the Padule, could scarcely"
14494,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,be entreated to eat a morsel of bread or sit down.
14495,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14496,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Give him a flask or two of our wine; he will like it
14497,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,better than the sour puddle of the plain.
14498,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14499,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ He is gone back.
14500,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14501,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Gone! who is he, pray?"
14502,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14503,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Assunta._ Luca, to be sure."
14504,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14505,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ What Luca?
14506,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14507,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Assunta._ Dominedio! O Riverenza! how sadly must Ser Giovanni, my"
14508,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"poor Padrone, have lost his memory in this cruel long illness! he"
14509,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"cannot recollect young Luca of the Bientola, who married Maria."
14510,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14511,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ I never heard of either, to the best of my knowledge."
14512,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14513,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Assunta._ Be pleased to mention this in your prayers to-night, Ser"
14514,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Canonico! May Our Lady soon give him back his memory! and everything
14515,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"else she has been pleased (only in play, I hope) to take away from"
14516,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"him! Ser Francesco, you must have heard all over the world how Maria"
14517,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Gargarelli, who lived in the service of our paroco, somehow was"
14518,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,outwitted by Satanasso. Monsignore thought the paroco had not done all
14519,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"he might have done against his wiles and craftiness, and sent his"
14520,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Reverence over to the monastery in the mountains, Laverna yonder, to"
14521,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,make him look sharp; and there he is yet.
14522,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14523,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,And now does Signor Padrone recollect?
14524,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14525,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Rather more distinctly.
14526,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14527,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Assunta._ Ah me! Rather more distinctly! have patience, Signor"
14528,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Padrone! I am too venturous, God help me! But, Riverenza, when Maria"
14529,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"was the scorn or the abhorrence of everybody else, excepting poor Luca"
14530,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Sabbatini, who had always cherished her, and excepting Signor Padrone,"
14531,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,who had never seen her in his lifetime ... for paroco Snello said he
14532,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,desired no visits from any who took liberties with Holy Church ... as
14533,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"if Padrone did! Luca one day came to me out of breath, with money in"
14534,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"his hand for our duck. Now it so happened that the duck, stuffed with"
14535,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"noble chestnuts, was going to table at that instant. I told Signor"
14536,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Padrone....
14537,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14538,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Assunta, I never heard thee repeat so long and tiresome a"
14539,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"story before, nor put thyself out of breath so. Come, we have had"
14540,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,enough of it.
14541,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14542,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ She is mortified: pray let her proceed.
14543,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14544,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ As you will.
14545,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14546,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ I told Signor Padrone how Luca was lamenting that Maria was
14547,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,seized with an _imagination_.
14548,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14549,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ No wonder then she fell into misfortune, and her"
14550,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,neighbours and friends avoided her.
14551,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14552,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ Riverenza! how can you smile? Signor Padrone! and you too?
14553,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"You shook your head and sighed at it when it happened. The Demonio,"
14554,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"who had caused all the first mischief, was not contented until he had"
14555,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,given her the _imagination_.
14556,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14557,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ He could not have finished his work more effectually.
14558,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14559,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Assunta._ He was balked, however. Luca said:"
14560,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14561,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'She shall not die under her wrongs, please God!'"
14562,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14563,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"I repeated the words to Signor Padrone.... He seems to listen,"
14564,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,Riverenza! and will remember presently ... and Signor Padrone cut away
14565,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"one leg for himself, clean forgetting all the chestnuts inside, and"
14566,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"said sharply, 'Give the bird to Luca; and, hark ye, bring back the"
14567,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,minestra.'
14568,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14569,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Maria loved Luca with all her heart, and Luca loved Maria with all"
14570,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,his: but they both hated paroco Snello for such neglect about the evil
14571,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"one. And even Monsignore, who sent for Luca on purpose, had some"
14572,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,difficulty in persuading him to forbear from choler and discourse. For
14573,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Luca, who never swears, swore bitterly that the devil should play no"
14574,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"such tricks again, nor alight on girls napping in the parsonage."
14575,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Monsignore thought he intended to take violent possession, and to keep"
14576,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,watch there himself without consent of the incumbent. 'I will have no
14577,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"scandal,' said Monsignore; so there was none. Maria, though she did"
14578,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"indeed, as I told your Reverence, love her Luca dearly, yet she long"
14579,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"refused to marry him, and cried very much at last on the wedding day,"
14580,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"and said, as she entered the porch:"
14581,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14582,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,'Luca! it is not yet too late to leave me.'
14583,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14584,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"He would have kissed her, but her face was upon his shoulder."
14585,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14586,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Pievano Locatelli married them, and gave them his blessing: and going"
14587,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"down from the altar, he said before the people, as he stood on the"
14588,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"last step: 'Be comforted, child! be comforted! God above knows that"
14589,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"thy husband is honest, and that thou art innocent.' Pievano's voice"
14590,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"trembled, for he was an aged and holy man, and had walked two miles on"
14591,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the occasion. Pulcheria, his governante, eighty years old, carried an"
14592,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"apronful of lilies to bestrew the altar; and partly from the lilies,"
14593,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,and partly from the blessed angels who (although invisible) were
14594,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"present, the church was filled with fragrance. Many who heretofore had"
14595,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"been frightened at hearing the mention of Maria's name, ventured now"
14596,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"to walk up toward her; and some gave her needles, and some offered"
14597,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"skeins of thread, and some ran home again for pots of honey."
14598,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14599,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ And why didst not thou take her some trifle?
14600,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14601,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ I had none.
14602,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14603,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Surely there are always such about the premises.
14604,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14605,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ Not mine to give away.
14606,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14607,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ So then at thy hands, Assunta, she went off not"
14608,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"overladen. Ne'er a bone-bodkin out of thy bravery, ay?"
14609,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14610,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Assunta._ I ran out knitting, with the woodbine and syringa in the"
14611,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,basket for the parlour. I made the basket ... I and ... but myself
14612,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"chiefly, for boys are loiterers."
14613,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14614,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Well, well: why not bestow the basket, together with its"
14615,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,rich contents?
14616,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14617,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ I am ashamed to say it ... I covered my half-stocking with
14618,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"them as quickly as I could, and ran after her, and presented it. Not"
14619,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"knowing what was under the flowers, and never minding the liberty I"
14620,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"had taken, being a stranger to her, she accepted it as graciously as"
14621,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"possible, and bade me be happy."
14622,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14623,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ I hope you have always kept her command.
14624,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14625,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Assunta._ Nobody is ever unhappy here, except Fra Biagio, who frets"
14626,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,sometimes: but that may be the walk; or he may fancy Ser Giovanni to
14627,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,be worse than he really is.
14628,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14629,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"... Having now performed her mission and concluded her narrative, she"
14630,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"bowed, and said:"
14631,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14632,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Excuse me, Riverenza! excuse me, Signor Padrone! my arm aches with"
14633,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,this great fish.'
14634,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14635,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Then, bowing again, and moving her eyes modestly toward each, she"
14636,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"added, 'with permission!' and left the chamber."
14637,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14638,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'About the sposina,' after a pause began Ser Francesco: 'about the"
14639,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"sposina, I do not see the matter clearly.'"
14640,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14641,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'You have studied too much for seeing all things clearly,' answered"
14642,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Ser Giovanni; 'you see only the greatest. In fine, the devil, on this"
14643,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"count, is acquitted by acclamation; and the paroco Snello eats lettuce"
14644,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,and chicory up yonder at Laverna. He has mendicant friars for his
14645,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"society every day; and snails, as pure as water can wash and boil"
14646,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"them, for his repast on festivals. Under this discipline, if they keep"
14647,THIRD DAY'S INTERVIEW,"it up, surely one devil out of legion will depart from him.'"

14661,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"and it is the peculiar gift of an elevated mind. Nevertheless, you"

14685,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Does not the same reflection come upon us, when we have laid aside our"
14686,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"compositions for a time, and look into them again more leisurely? Do"
14687,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"we not wonder at our own profusion, and say like the philosopher:"
14688,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14689,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,'How many things are here which I do not want!'
14690,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14691,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,It may happen that we pull up flowers with weeds; but better this than
14692,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,rankness. We must bear to see our first-born dispatched before our
14693,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"eyes, and give them up quietly."
14694,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14695,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ The younger will be the most reluctant. There are poets
14696,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,among us who mistake in themselves the freckles of the hay-fever for
14697,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,beauty-spots. In another half-century their volumes will be inquired
14698,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,after; but only for the sake of cutting out an illuminated letter from
14699,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the title-page, or of transplanting the willow at the end, that hangs"
14700,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,so prettily over the tomb of Amaryllis. If they wish to be healthy and
14701,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"vigorous, let them open their bosoms to the breezes of Sunium; for the"
14702,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"air of Latium is heavy and overcharged. Above all, they must remember"
14703,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"two admonitions; first, that sweet things hurt digestion; secondly,"
14704,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,that great sails are ill adapted to small vessels. What is there
14705,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,lovely in poetry unless there be moderation and composure? Are they
14706,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"not better than the hot, uncontrollable harlotry of a flaunting,"
14707,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"dishevelled enthusiasm? Whoever has the power of creating, has"
14708,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,likewise the inferior power of keeping his creation in order. The best
14709,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"poets are the most impressive, because their steps are regular; for"
14710,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,without regularity there is neither strength nor state. Look at
14711,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Sophocles, look at Aeschylus, look at Homer."
14712,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14713,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ I agree with you entirely to the whole extent of your
14714,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"observations; and, if you will continue, I am ready to lay aside my"
14715,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Dante for the present.
14716,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14717,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ No, no; we must have him again between us: there is no"
14718,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,danger that he will sour our tempers.
14719,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14720,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ In comparing his and yours, since you forbid me to declare"
14721,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"all I think of your genius, you will at least allow me to congratulate"
14722,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,you as being the happier of the two.
14723,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14724,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Frequently, where there is great power in poetry, the"
14725,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"imagination makes encroachments on the heart, and uses it as her own."
14726,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"I have shed tears on writings which never cost the writer a sigh, but"
14727,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"which occasioned him to rub the palms of his hands together, until"
14728,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"they were ready to strike fire, with satisfaction at having overcome"
14729,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,the difficulty of being tender.
14730,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14731,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Giovanni! are you not grown satirical?
14732,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14733,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Not in this. It is a truth as broad and glaring as the
14734,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"eye of the Cyclops. To make you amends for your shuddering, I will"
14735,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"express my doubt, on the other hand, whether Dante felt all the"
14736,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,indignation he threw into his poetry. We are immoderately fond of
14737,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"warming ourselves; and we do not think, or care, what the fire is"
14738,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"composed of. Be sure it is not always of cedar, like Circe's. Our"
14739,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Alighieri had slipped into the habit of vituperation; and he thought
14740,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,it fitted him; so he never left it off.
14741,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14742,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Serener colours are pleasanter to our eyes and more
14743,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,becoming to our character. The chief desire in every man of genius is
14744,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"to be thought one; and no fear or apprehension lessens it. Alighieri,"
14745,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"who had certainly studied the gospel, must have been conscious that he"
14746,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"not only was inhumane, but that he betrayed a more vindictive spirit"
14747,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,than any pope or prelate who is enshrined within the fretwork of his
14748,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,golden grating.
14749,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14750,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Unhappily, his strong talon had grown into him, and it"
14751,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"would have pained him to suffer amputation. This eagle, unlike"
14752,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Jupiter's, never loosened the thunderbolt from it under the influence"
14753,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,of harmony.
14754,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14755,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ The only good thing we can expect in such minds and
14756,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"tempers is good poetry: let us at least get that; and, having it, let"
14757,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"us keep and value it. If you had never written some wanton stories,"
14758,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,you would never have been able to show the world how much wiser and
14759,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,better you grew afterward.
14760,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14761,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Alas! if I live, I hope to show it. You have raised my"
14762,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"spirits: and now, dear Francesco! do say a couple of prayers for me,"
14763,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"while I lay together the materials of a tale; a right merry one, I"
14764,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"promise you. Faith! it shall amuse you, and pay decently for the"
14765,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,prayers; a good honest litany-worth. I hardly know whether I ought to
14766,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,have a nun in it: do you think I may?
14767,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14768,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Cannot you do without one?
14769,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14770,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ No; a nun I must have: say nothing against her; I can
14771,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,more easily let the abbess alone. Yet Frate Biagio ... that Frate
14772,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Biagio, who never came to visit me but when he thought I was at"
14773,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,extremities or asleep.... Assuntina! are you there?
14774,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14775,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ No; do you want her?
14776,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14777,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Not a bit. That Frate Biagio has heightened my pulse when
14778,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,I could not lower it again. The very devil is that Frate for
14779,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,heightening pulses. And with him I shall now make merry ... God
14780,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,willing ... in God's good time ... should it be His divine will to
14781,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,restore me! which I think He has begun to do miraculously. I seem to
14782,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,be within a frog's leap of well again; and we will presently have some
14783,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,rare fun in my _Tale of the Frate_.
14784,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14785,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Do not openly name him.
14786,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14787,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ He shall recognize himself by one single expression. He
14788,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"said to me, when I was at the worst:"
14789,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14790,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,'Ser Giovanni! it would not be much amiss (with permission!) if you
14791,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"begin to think (at any spare time), just a morsel, of eternity.'"
14792,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14793,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Ah! Fra Biagio!' answered I, contritely, 'I never heard a sermon of"
14794,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"yours but I thought of it seriously and uneasily, long before the"
14795,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,discourse was over.'
14796,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14797,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'So must all,' replied he, 'and yet few have the grace to own it.'"
14798,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14799,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Now mind, Francesco! if it should please the Lord to call me unto Him,"
14800,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"I say, _The Nun and Fra Biagio_ will be found, after my decease, in"
14801,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the closet cut out of the wall, behind yon Saint Zacharias in blue and"
14802,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,yellow.
14803,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14804,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Well done! well done! Francesco. I never heard any man repeat his
14805,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,prayers so fast and fluently. Why! how many (at a guess) have you
14806,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"repeated? Such is the power of friendship, and such the habit of"
14807,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,religion! They have done me good: I feel myself stronger already.
14808,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"To-morrow I think I shall be able, by leaning on that stout maple"
14809,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"stick in the corner, to walk half over my podere."
14810,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14811,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Have you done? have you done?
14812,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14813,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Be quiet: you may talk too much.
14814,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14815,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ I cannot be quiet for another hour; so, if you have any"
14816,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"more prayers to get over, stick the spur into the other side of them:"
14817,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"they must verily speed, if they beat the last."
14818,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14819,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ Be more serious, dear Giovanni."
14820,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14821,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Never bid a convalescent be more serious: no, nor a sick"
14822,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,man neither. To health it may give that composure which it takes away
14823,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"from sickness. Every man will have his hours of seriousness; but, like"
14824,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the hours of rest, they often are ill-chosen and unwholesome. Be"
14825,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"assured, our heavenly Father is as well pleased to see His children in"
14826,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the playground as in the schoolroom. He has provided both for us, and"
14827,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,has given us intimations when each should occupy us.
14828,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14829,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ You are right, Giovanni! but we know which bell is heard"
14830,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the most distinctly. We fold our arms at the one, try the cooler part"
14831,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"of the pillow, and turn again to slumber; at the first stroke of the"
14832,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"other, we are beyond our monitors. As for you, hardly Dante himself"
14833,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,could make you grave.
14834,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14835,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ I do not remember how it happened that we slipped away
14836,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,from his side. One of us must have found him tedious.
14837,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14838,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ If you were really and substantially at his side, he would"
14839,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,have no mercy on you.
14840,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14841,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ In sooth, our good Alighieri seems to have had the"
14842,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"appetite of a dogfish or shark, and to have bitten the harder the"
14843,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,warmer he was. I would not voluntarily be under his manifold rows of
14844,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,dentals. He has an incisor to every saint in the calendar. I should
14845,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"fare, methinks, like Brutus and the archbishop. He is forced to"
14846,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"stretch himself, out of sheer listlessness, in so idle a place as"
14847,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Purgatory: he loses half his strength in Paradise: Hell alone makes
14848,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,him alert and lively: there he moves about and threatens as
14849,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,tremendously as the serpent that opposed the legions on their march
14850,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"in Africa. He would not have been contented in Tuscany itself, even"
14851,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,had his enemies left him unmolested. Were I to write on his model a
14852,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"tripartite poem, I think it should be entitled, _Earth, Italy, and"
14853,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Heaven_.
14854,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14855,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ You will never give yourself the trouble.
14856,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14857,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ I should not succeed.
14858,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14859,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ Perhaps not: but you have done very much, and may be able"
14860,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,to do very much more.
14861,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14862,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Wonderful is it to me, when I consider that an infirm and"
14863,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"helpless creature, as I am, should be capable of laying thoughts up in"
14864,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"their cabinets of words, which Time, as he rushes by, with the"
14865,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"revolutions of stormy and destructive years, can never move from their"
14866,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"places. On this coarse mattress, one among the homeliest in the fair"
14867,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"at Impruneta, is stretched an old burgess of Certaldo, of whom perhaps"
14868,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,more will be known hereafter than we know of the Ptolemies and the
14869,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Pharaohs; while popes and princes are lying as unregarded as the fleas
14870,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"that are shaken out of the window. Upon my life, Francesco! to think"
14871,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,of this is enough to make a man presumptuous.
14872,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14873,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ No, Giovanni! not when the man thinks justly of it, as"
14874,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"such a man ought to do, and must. For so mighty a power over Time, who"
14875,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"casts all other mortals under his, comes down to us from a greater;"
14876,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,and it is only if we abuse the victory that it were better we had
14877,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,encountered a defeat. Unremitting care must be taken that nothing soil
14878,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,the monuments we are raising: sure enough we are that nothing can
14879,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"subvert, and nothing but our negligence, or worse than negligence,"
14880,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"efface them. Under the glorious lamp entrusted to your vigilance, one"
14881,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"among the lights of the world, which the ministering angels of our God"
14882,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"have suspended for His service, let there stand, with unclosing eyes,"
14883,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Integrity, Compassion, Self-denial."
14884,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14885,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ These are holier and cheerfuller images than Dante has
14886,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,been setting up before us. I hope every thesis in dispute among his
14887,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,theologians will be settled ere I set foot among them. I like Tuscany
14888,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,well enough: it answers all my purposes for the present: and I am
14889,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,without the benefit of those preliminary studies which might render me
14890,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,a worthy auditor of incomprehensible wisdom.
14891,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14892,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ I do not wonder you are attached to Tuscany. Many as have
14893,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"been your visits and adventures in other parts, you have rendered it"
14894,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,pleasanter and more interesting than any: and indeed we can scarcely
14895,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,walk in any quarter from the gates of Florence without the
14896,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,recollection of some witty or affecting story related by you. Every
14897,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"street, every farm, is peopled by your genius: and this population"
14898,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"cannot change with seasons or with ages, with factions or with"
14899,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,incursions. Ghibellines and Guelphs will have been contested for only
14900,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"by the worms, long before the _Decameron_ has ceased to be recited on"
14901,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,our banks of blue lilies and under our arching vines. Another plague
14902,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,may come amidst us; and something of a solace in so terrible a
14903,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"visitation would be found in your pages, by those to whom letters are"
14904,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,a refuge and relief.
14905,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14906,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ I do indeed think my little bevy from Santa Maria Novella
14907,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"would be better company on such an occasion, than a devil with three"
14908,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"heads, who diverts the pain his claws inflicted, by sticking his fangs"
14909,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,in another place.
14910,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14911,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ This is atrocious, not terrific nor grand. Alighieri is"
14912,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"grand by his lights, not by his shadows; by his human affections, not"
14913,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,by his infernal. As the minutest sands are the labours of some
14914,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"profound sea, or the spoils of some vast mountain, in like manner his"
14915,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,horrid wastes and wearying minutenesses are the chafings of a
14916,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"turbulent spirit, grasping the loftiest things and penetrating the"
14917,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"deepest, and moving and moaning on the earth in loneliness and"
14918,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,sadness.
14919,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14920,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Among men he is what among waters is
14921,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14922,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"The strange, mysterious, solitary Nile."
14923,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14924,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Is that his verse? I do not remember it.
14925,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14926,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ No, it is mine for the present: how long it may continue"
14927,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,mine I cannot tell. I never run after those who steal my apples: it
14928,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,would only tire me: and they are hardly worth recovering when they are
14929,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"bruised and bitten, as they are usually. I would not stand upon my"
14930,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"verses: it is a perilous boy's trick, which we ought to leave off when"
14931,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"we put on square shoes. Let our prose show what we are, and our poetry"
14932,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,what we have been.
14933,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14934,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ You would never have given this advice to Alighieri.
14935,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14936,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ I would never plough porphyry; there is ground fitter for
14937,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"grain. Alighieri is the parent of his system, like the sun, about whom"
14938,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,all the worlds are but particles thrown forth from him. We may write
14939,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"little things well, and accumulate one upon another; but never will"
14940,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,any be justly called a great poet unless he has treated a great
14941,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"subject worthily. He may be the poet of the lover and of the idler, he"
14942,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,may be the poet of green fields or gay society; but whoever is this
14943,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"can be no more. A throne is not built of birds'-nests, nor do a"
14944,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,thousand reeds make a trumpet.
14945,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14946,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ I wish Alighieri had blown his on nobler occasions.
14947,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14948,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ We may rightly wish it: but, in regretting what he"
14949,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"wanted, let us acknowledge what he had: and never forget (which we"
14950,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,omitted to mention) that he borrowed less from his predecessors than
14951,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,any of the Roman poets from theirs. Reasonably may it be expected that
14952,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"almost all who follow will be greatly more indebted to antiquity, to"
14953,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"whose stores we, every year, are making some addition."
14954,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14955,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ It can be held no flaw in the title-deeds of genius, if"
14956,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,the same thoughts reappear as have been exhibited long ago. The
14957,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,indisputable sign of defect should be looked for in the proportion
14958,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,they bear to the unquestionably original. There are ideas which
14959,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"necessarily must occur to minds of the like magnitude and materials,"
14960,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"aspect and temperature. When two ages are in the same phasis, they"
14961,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"will excite the same humours, and produce the same coincidences and"
14962,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"combinations. In addition to which, a great poet may really borrow: he"
14963,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,may even condescend to an obligation at the hand of an equal or
14964,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,inferior: but he forfeits his title if he borrows more than the amount
14965,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,of his own possessions. The nightingale himself takes somewhat of his
14966,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"song from birds less glorified: and the lark, having beaten with her"
14967,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"wing the very gates of heaven, cools her breast among the grass. The"
14968,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"lowlier of intellect may lay out a table in their field, at which"
14969,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,table the highest one shall sometimes be disposed to partake: want
14970,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"does not compel him. Imitation, as we call it, is often weakness, but"
14971,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,it likewise is often sympathy.
14972,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14973,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Our poet was seldom accessible in this quarter. Invective
14974,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"picks up the first stone on the wayside, and wants leisure to consult"
14975,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,a forerunner.
14976,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14977,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Dante (original enough everywhere) is coarse and clumsy in
14978,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"this career. Vengeance has nothing to do with comedy, nor properly"
14979,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,with satire. The satirist who told us that Indignation made his verses
14980,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"for him, might have been told in return that she excluded him thereby"
14981,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"from the first class, and thrust him among the rhetoricians and"
14982,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"declaimers. Lucretius, in his vituperation, is graver and more"
14983,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"dignified than Alighieri. Painful; to see how tolerant is the atheist,"
14984,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,how intolerant the Catholic: how anxiously the one removes from among
14985,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the sufferings of Mortality, her last and heaviest, the fear of a"
14986,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,vindictive Fury pursuing her shadow across rivers of fire and tears;
14987,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"how laboriously the other brings down Anguish and Despair, even when"
14988,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Death has done his work. How grateful the one is to that beneficent
14989,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"philosopher who made him at peace with himself, and tolerant and"
14990,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,kindly toward his fellow-creatures! how importunate the other that God
14991,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"should forgo His divine mercy, and hurl everlasting torments both upon"
14992,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,the dead and the living!
14993,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
14994,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ I have always heard that Ser Dante was a very good man
14995,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,and sound Catholic: but Christ forgive me if my heart is oftener on
14996,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the side of Lucretius![17] Observe, I say, my heart; nothing more. I"
14997,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,devoutly hold to the sacraments and the mysteries: yet somehow I would
14998,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"rather see men tranquillized than frightened out of their senses, and"
14999,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,rather fast asleep than burning. Sometimes I have been ready to
15000,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"believe, as far as our holy faith will allow me, that it were better"
15001,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"our Lord were nowhere, than torturing in His inscrutable wisdom, to"
15002,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"all eternity, so many myriads of us poor devils, the creatures of His"
15003,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"hands. Do not cross thyself so thickly, Francesco! nor hang down thy"
15004,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"nether lip so loosely, languidly, and helplessly; for I would be a"
15005,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"good Catholic, alive or dead. But, upon my conscience, it goes hard"
15006,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"with me to think it of Him, when I hear that woodlark yonder, gushing"
15007,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"with joyousness, or when I see the beautiful clouds, resting so softly"
15008,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"one upon another, dissolving ... and not damned for it. Above all, I"
15009,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"am slow to apprehend it, when I remember His great goodness vouchsafed"
15010,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"to me, and reflect on my sinful life heretofore, chiefly in summer"
15011,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"time, and in cities, or their vicinity. But I was tempted beyond my"
15012,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"strength; and I fell as any man might do. However, this last illness,"
15013,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"by God's grace, has well-nigh brought me to my right mind again in all"
15014,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"such matters: and if I get stout in the present month, and can hold"
15015,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"out the next without sliding, I do verily think I am safe, or nearly"
15016,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"so, until the season of beccaficoes."
15017,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15018,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Be not too confident!
15019,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15020,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Well, I will not be."
15021,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15022,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ But be firm.
15023,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15024,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Assuntina! what! are you come in again?
15025,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15026,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Assunta._ Did you or my master call me, Riverenza?"
15027,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15028,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ No, child!"
15029,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15030,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Oh! get you gone! Get you gone! you little rogue you!
15031,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15032,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Francesco, I feel quite well. Your kindness to my playful creatures in"
15033,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the _Decameron_ has revived me, and has put me into good humour with"
15034,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,the greater part of them. Are you quite certain the Madonna will not
15035,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,expect me to keep my promise? You said you were: I need not ask you
15036,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"again. I will accept the whole of your assurances, and half your"
15037,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,praises.
15038,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15039,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ To represent so vast a variety of personages so
15040,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"characteristically as you have done, to give the wise all their"
15041,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"wisdom, the witty all their wit, and (what is harder to do"
15042,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"advantageously) the simple all their simplicity, requires a genius"
15043,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,such as you alone possess. Those who doubt it are the least dangerous
15044,FOURTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,of your rivals.

15053,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15054,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,It being now the last morning that Petrarca could remain with his
15055,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"friend, he resolved to pass early into his bedchamber. Boccaccio had"
15056,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"risen and was standing at the open window, with his arms against it."
15057,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Renovated health sparkled in the eyes of the one; surprise and delight
15058,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,and thankfulness to Heaven filled the other's with sudden tears. He
15059,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"clasped Giovanni, kissed his flaccid and sallow cheek, and falling on"
15060,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"his knees, adored the Giver of life, the source of health to body and"
15061,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,soul. Giovanni was not unmoved: he bent one knee as he leaned on the
15062,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"shoulder of Francesco, looking down into his face, repeating his"
15063,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"words, and adding:"
15064,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15065,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Blessed be Thou, O Lord! who sendest me health again! and blessings"
15066,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,on Thy messenger who brought it.'
15067,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15068,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,He had slept soundly; for ere he closed his eyes he had unburdened his
15069,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"mind of its freight, not only by employing the prayers appointed by"
15070,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Holy Church, but likewise by ejaculating; as sundry of the fathers did"
15071,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"of old. He acknowledged his contrition for many transgressions, and"
15072,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,chiefly for uncharitable thoughts of Fra Biagio: on which occasion he
15073,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"turned fairly round on his couch, and leaning his brow against the"
15074,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"wall, and his body being in a becomingly curved position, and proper"
15075,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"for the purpose, he thus ejaculated:"
15076,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15077,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Thou knowest, O most Holy Virgin! that never have I spoken to"
15078,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"handmaiden at this villetta, or within my mansion at Certaldo,"
15079,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"wantonly or indiscreetly, but have always been, inasmuch as may be,"
15080,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the guardian of innocence; deeming it better, when irregular thoughts"
15081,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"assailed me, to ventilate them abroad than to poison the house with"
15082,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"them. And if, sinner as I am, I have thought uncharitably of others,"
15083,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"and more especially of Fra Biagio, pardon me, out of thy exceeding"
15084,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"great mercies! And let it not be imputed to me, if I have kept, and"
15085,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"may keep hereafter, an eye over him, in wariness and watchfulness; not"
15086,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"otherwise. For thou knowest, O Madonna! that many who have a perfect"
15087,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"and unwavering faith in thee, yet do cover up their cheese from the"
15088,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,nibblings of vermin.'
15089,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15090,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Whereupon, he turned round again, threw himself on his back at full"
15091,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"length, and feeling the sheets cool, smooth, and refreshing, folded"
15092,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"his arms, and slept instantaneously. The consequence of his wholesome"
15093,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,slumber was a calm alacrity: and the idea that his visitor would be
15094,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"happy at seeing him on his feet again, made him attempt to get up: at"
15095,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"which he succeeded, to his own wonder. And it was increased by the"
15096,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"manifestation of his strength in opening the casement, stiff from"
15097,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"being closed, and swelled by the continuance of the rains. The morning"
15098,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,was warm and sunny: and it is known that on this occasion he composed
15099,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,the verses below:
15100,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15101,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,My old familiar cottage-green!
15102,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,I see once more thy pleasant sheen;
15103,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,The gossamer suspended over
15104,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Smart celandine by lusty clover;
15105,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,And the last blossom of the plum
15106,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Inviting her first leaves to come;
15107,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Which hang a little back, but show"
15108,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,'Tis not their nature to say no.
15109,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,I scarcely am in voice to sing
15110,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,How graceful are the steps of Spring;
15111,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,And ah! it makes me sigh to look
15112,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"How leaps along my merry brook,"
15113,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,The very same to-day as when
15114,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,He chirrupt first to maids and men.
15115,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15116,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ I can rejoice at the freshness of your feelings: but the
15117,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,sight of the green turf reminds me rather of its ultimate use and
15118,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,destination.
15119,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15120,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"For many serves the parish pall,"
15121,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,The turf in common serves for all.
15122,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15123,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Very true; and, such being the case, let us carefully"
15124,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"fold it up, and lay it by until we call for it."
15125,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15126,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Francesco, you made me quite light-headed yesterday. I am rather too"
15127,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"old to dance either with Spring, as I have been saying, or with"
15128,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Vanity: and yet I accepted her at your hand as a partner. In future,"
15129,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"no more of comparisons for me! You not only can do me no good, but you"
15130,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,can leave me no pleasure: for here I shall remain the few days I have
15131,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"to live, and shall see nobody who will be disposed to remind me of"
15132,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"your praises. Beside, you yourself will get hated for them. We neither"
15133,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,can deserve praise nor receive it with impunity.
15134,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15135,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Have you never remarked that it is into quiet water that
15136,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,children throw pebbles to disturb it? and that it is into deep caverns
15137,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,that the idle drop sticks and dirt? We must expect such treatment.
15138,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15139,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Your admonition shall have its wholesome influence over
15140,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"me, when the fever your praises have excited has grown moderate."
15141,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15142,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,... After the conversation on this topic and various others had
15143,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"continued some time, it was interrupted by a visitor. The clergy and"
15144,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"monkery at Certaldo had never been cordial with Messer Giovanni, it"
15145,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,being suspected that certain of his _Novelle_ were modelled on
15146,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"originals in their orders. Hence, although they indeed both professed"
15147,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"and felt esteem for Canonico Petrarca, they abstained from expressing"
15148,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,it at the villetta. But Frate Biagio of San Vivaldo was (by his own
15149,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"appointment) the friend of the house; and, being considered as very"
15150,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"expert in pharmacy, had, day after day, brought over no indifferent"
15151,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"store of simples, in ptisans, and other refections, during the"
15152,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,continuance of Ser Giovanni's ailment. Something now moved him to cast
15153,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,about in his mind whether it might not appear dutiful to make another
15154,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"visit. Perhaps he thought it possible that, among those who"
15155,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"peradventure had seen him lately on the road, one or other might"
15156,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"expect from him a solution of the questions, What sort of person was"
15157,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,the _crowned martyr_? whether he carried a palm in his hand? whether a
15158,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,seam was visible across the throat? whether he wore a ring over his
15159,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"glove, with a chrysolite in it, like the bishops, but representing the"
15160,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,city of Jerusalem and the judgment-seat of Pontius Pilate? Such were
15161,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,the reports; but the inhabitants of San Vivaldo could not believe the
15162,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Certaldese, who, inhabiting the next township to them, were naturally"
15163,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"their enemies. Yet they might believe Frate Biagio, and certainly"
15164,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"would interrogate him accordingly. He formed his determination, put"
15165,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"his frock and hood on, and gave a curvature to his shoe, to evince his"
15166,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"knowledge of the world, by pushing the extremity of it with his"
15167,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,breast-bone against the corner of his cell. Studious of his figure and
15168,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"of his attire, he walked as much as possible on his heels, to keep up"
15169,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,the reformation he had wrought in the workmanship of the cordwainer.
15170,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"On former occasions he had borrowed a horse, as being wanted to hear"
15171,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"confession or to carry medicines, which might otherwise be too late."
15172,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"But, having put on an entirely new habiliment, and it being the season"
15173,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"when horses are beginning to do the same, he deemed it prudent to"
15174,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"travel on foot. Approaching the villetta, his first intention was to"
15175,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,walk directly into his patient's room: but he found it impossible to
15176,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"resist the impulses of pride, in showing Assunta his rigid and stately"
15177,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"frock, and shoes rather of the equestrian order than the monastic. So"
15178,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"he went into the kitchen where the girl was at work, having just taken"
15179,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,away the remains of the breakfast.
15180,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15181,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Frate Biagio!' cried she, 'is this you? Have you been sleeping at"
15182,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Conte Jeronimo's?'
15183,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15184,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Not I,' replied he."
15185,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15186,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'Why!' said she, 'those are surely his shoes! Santa Maria! you must"
15187,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"have put them on in the dusk of the morning, to say your prayers in!"
15188,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Here! here! take these old ones of Signor Padrone, for the love of"
15189,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,God! I hope your Reverence met nobody.'
15190,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15191,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ What dost smile at?
15192,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15193,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Assunta._ Smile at! I could find in my heart to laugh outright, if I"
15194,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,only were certain that nobody had seen your Reverence in such a funny
15195,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,trim. Riverenza! put on these.
15196,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15197,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ Not I indeed.
15198,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15199,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ Allow me then?
15200,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15201,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Frate._ No, nor you."
15202,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15203,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Assunta._ Then let me stand upon yours, to push down the points."
15204,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15205,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"... Frate Biagio now began to relent a little, when Assunta, who had"
15206,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"made one step toward the project, bethought herself suddenly, and"
15207,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,said:
15208,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15209,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'No; I might miss my footing. But, mercy upon us! what made you cramp"
15210,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,your Reverence with those ox-yoke shoes? and strangle your Reverence
15211,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,with that hangdog collar?'
15212,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15213,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'If you must know,' answered the Frate, reddening, 'it was because I"
15214,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,am making a visit to the Canonico of Parma. I should like to know
15215,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,something about him: perhaps you could tell me?'
15216,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15217,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ Ever so much.
15218,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15219,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ I thought no less: indeed I knew it. Which goes to bed first?
15220,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15221,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ Both together.
15222,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15223,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ Demonio! what dost mean?
15224,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15225,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Assunta._ He tells me never to sit up waiting, but to say my prayers"
15226,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,and dream of the Virgin.
15227,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15228,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ As if it was any business of his! Does he put out his lamp
15229,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,himself?
15230,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15231,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ To be sure he does: why should not he? what should he be
15232,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"afraid of? It is not winter: and beside, there is a mat upon the"
15233,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"floor, all round the bed, excepting the top and bottom."
15234,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15235,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ I am quite convinced he never said anything to make you
15236,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,blush. Why are you silent?
15237,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15238,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ I have a right.
15239,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15240,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ He did then? ay? Do not nod your head: that will never do.
15241,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Discreet girls speak plainly.
15242,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15243,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ What would you have?
15244,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15245,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Frate._ The truth; the truth; again, I say, the truth."
15246,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15247,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ He _did_ then.
15248,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15249,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ I knew it! The most dangerous man living!
15250,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15251,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ Ah! indeed he is! Signor Padrone said so.
15252,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15253,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Frate._ He knows him of old: he warned you, it seems."
15254,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15255,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ Me! He never said it was I who was in danger.
15256,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15257,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ He might: it was his duty.
15258,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15259,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ Am I so fat? Lord! you may feel every rib. Girls who run
15260,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"about as I do, slip away from apoplexy."
15261,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15262,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Frate._ Ho! ho! that is all, is it?"
15263,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15264,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ And bad enough too! that such good-natured men should ever
15265,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"grow so bulky; and stand in danger, as Padrone said they both do, of"
15266,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,such a seizure?
15267,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15268,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ What? and art ready to cry about it? Old folks cannot die
15269,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,easier: and there are always plenty of younger to run quick enough for
15270,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,a confessor. But I must not trifle in this manner. It is my duty to
15271,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,set your feet in the right way: it is my bounden duty to report to Ser
15272,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Giovanni all irregularities I know of, committed in his domicile. I"
15273,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"could indeed, and would, remit a trifle, on hearing the worst. Tell me"
15274,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"now, Assunta! tell me, you little angel! did you ... we all may, the"
15275,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"very best of us may, and do ... sin, my sweet?"
15276,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15277,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ You may be sure I did not: for whenever I sin I run into
15278,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"church directly, although it snows or thunders: else I never could see"
15279,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"again Padrone's face, or any one's."
15280,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15281,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ You do not come to me.
15282,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15283,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ You live at San Vivaldo.
15284,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15285,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ But when there is sin so pressing I am always ready to be
15286,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"found. You perplex, you puzzle me. Tell me at once how he made you"
15287,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,blush.
15288,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15289,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ Well then!
15290,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15291,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ Well then! you did not hang back so before him. I lose all
15292,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,patience.
15293,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15294,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ So famous a man!...
15295,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15296,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ No excuse in that.
15297,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15298,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ So dear to Padrone....
15299,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15300,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ The more shame for him!
15301,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15302,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ Called me....
15303,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15304,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Frate._ And _called_ you, did he! the traitorous swine!"
15305,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15306,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Assunta._ Called me ... _good girl_.
15307,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15308,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Frate._ Psha! the wenches, I think, are all mad: but few of them in"
15309,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,this manner.
15310,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15311,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,*       *       *       *       *
15312,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15313,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"... Without saying another word, Fra Biagio went forward and opened"
15314,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the bedchamber door, saying briskly:"
15315,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15316,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,'Servant! Ser Giovanni! Ser Canonico! most devoted! most obsequious! I
15317,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"venture to incommode you. Thanks to God, Ser Canonico, you are looking"
15318,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,well for your years. They tell me you were formerly (who would believe
15319,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"it?) the handsomest man in Christendom, and worked your way glibly,"
15320,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,yonder at Avignon.
15321,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15322,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,'Capperi! Ser Giovanni! I never observed that you were sitting
15323,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"bolt-upright in that long-backed armchair, instead of lying abed."
15324,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Quite in the right. I am rejoiced at such a change for the better. Who
15325,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,advised it?'
15326,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15327,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ So many thanks to Fra Biagio! I not only am sitting up,"
15328,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"but have taken a draught of fresh air at the window, and every leaf"
15329,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,had a little present of sunshine for me.
15330,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15331,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"There is one pleasure, Fra Biagio, which I fancy you never have"
15332,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"experienced, and I hardly know whether I ought to wish it you; the"
15333,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,first sensation of health after a long confinement.
15334,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15335,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Frate._ Thanks! infinite! I would take any man's word for that,"
15336,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,without a wish to try it. Everybody tells me I am exactly what I was a
15337,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"dozen years ago; while, for my part, I see everybody changed: those"
15338,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"who ought to be much about my age, even those.... Per Bacco! I told"
15339,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,them my thoughts when they had told me theirs; and they were not so
15340,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,agreeable as they used to be in former days.
15341,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15342,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ How people hate sincerity!
15343,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15344,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Cospetto! why, Frate! what hast got upon thy toes? Hast killed some"
15345,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Tartar and tucked his bow into one, and torn the crescent from the"
15346,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,vizier's tent to make the other match it? Hadst thou fallen in thy
15347,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,mettlesome expedition (and it is a mercy and a miracle thou didst
15348,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,not) those sacrilegious shoes would have impaled thee.
15349,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15350,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Frate._ It was a mistake in the shoemaker. But no pain or incommodity
15351,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"whatsoever could detain me from paying my duty to Ser Canonico, the"
15352,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"first moment I heard of his auspicious arrival, or from offering my"
15353,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"congratulations to Ser Giovanni, on the annunciation that he was"
15354,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,recovered and looking out of the window. All Tuscany was standing on
15355,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"the watch for it, and the news flew like lightning. By this time it is"
15356,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,upon the Danube.
15357,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15358,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"And pray, Ser Canonico, how does Madonna Laura do?"
15359,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15360,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Peace to her gentle spirit! she is departed.
15361,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15362,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Frate._ Ay, true. I had quite forgotten: that is to say, I recollect"
15363,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"it. You told us as much, I think, in a poem on her death. Well, and do"
15364,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,you know! our friend Giovanni here is a bit of an author in his way.
15365,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15366,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Frate! you confuse my modesty.
15367,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15368,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Frate._ Murder will out. It is a fact, on my conscience. Have you"
15369,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"never heard anything about it, Canonico! Ha! we poets are sly fellows:"
15370,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,we can keep a secret.
15371,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15372,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Are you quite sure you can?
15373,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15374,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Frate._ Try, and trust me with any. I am a confessional on legs:"
15375,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,there is no more a whisper in me than in a woolsack.
15376,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15377,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"I am in feather again, as you see; and in tune, as you shall hear."
15378,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15379,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,April is not the month for moping. Sing it lustily.
15380,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15381,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Let it be your business to sing it, being a Frate; I can"
15382,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,only recite it.
15383,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15384,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Frate._ Pray do, then."
15385,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15386,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._
15387,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15388,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Frate Biagio! sempre quando
15389,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Qu√† tu vieni cavalcando,"
15390,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Pensi che le buone strade
15391,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Per il mondo sien ben rade;
15392,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"E, di quante sono brutte,"
15393,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,La pi√π brutta √® tua di tutte.
15394,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Badi, non cascare sulle"
15395,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Graziosissime fanciulle,"
15396,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Che con capo dritto, alzato,"
15397,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Uova portano al mercato.
15398,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Pessima mi pare l'opra
15399,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Rovesciarle sottosopra.
15400,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Deh! scansando le erte e sassi,"
15401,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Sempre con premura passi.
15402,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Caro amico! Frate Biagio!
15403,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Passi pur, ma passi adagio."
15404,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15405,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Frate._ Well now really, Canonico, for one not exactly one of us,"
15406,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"that canzone of Ser Giovanni has merit; has not it? I did not ride,"
15407,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"however, to-day; as you may see by the lining of my frock. But _plus"
15408,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"non vitiat_; ay, Canonico! About the roads he is right enough; they"
15409,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,are the devil's own roads; that must be said for them.
15410,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15411,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Ser Giovanni! with permission; your mention of eggs in the canzone has
15412,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,induced me to fancy I could eat a pair of them. The hens lay well now:
15413,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,that white one of yours is worth more than the goose that laid the
15414,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"golden: and you have a store of others, her equals or betters: we have"
15415,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"none like them at poor St. Vivaldo. _A riverderci, Ser Giovanni!"
15416,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Schiavo! Ser Canonico! mi commandino._
15417,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15418,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,*       *       *       *       *
15419,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15420,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"... Fra Biagio went back into the kitchen, helped himself to a quarter"
15421,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"of a loaf, ordered a flask of wine, and, trying several eggs against"
15422,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"his lips, selected seven, which he himself fried in oil, although the"
15423,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,maid offered her services. He never had been so little disposed to
15424,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,enter into conversation with her; and on her asking him how he found
15425,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"her master, he replied, that in bodily health Ser Giovanni, by his"
15426,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"prayers and ptisans, had much improved, but that his faculties were"
15427,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,wearing out apace. 'He may now run in the same couples with the
15428,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,Canonico: they cannot catch the mange one of the other: the one could
15429,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"say nothing to the purpose, and the other nothing at all. The whole"
15430,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"conversation was entirely at my charge,' added he. 'And now, Assunta,"
15431,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"since you press it, I will accept the service of your master's shoes."
15432,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,How I shall ever get home I don't know.' He took the shoes off the
15433,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"handles of the bellows, where Assunta had placed them out of her way,"
15434,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"and tucking one of his own under each arm, limped toward St. Vivaldo."
15435,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15436,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"The unwonted attention to smartness of apparel, in the only article"
15437,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"wherein it could be displayed, was suggested to Frate Biagio by"
15438,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"hearing that Ser Francesco, accustomed to courtly habits and elegant"
15439,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"society, and having not only small hands, but small feet, usually wore"
15440,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,red slippers in the morning. Fra Biagio had scarcely left the outer
15441,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"door, than he cordially cursed Ser Francesco for making such a fool of"
15442,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"him, and wearing slippers of black list. 'These canonicoes,' said he,"
15443,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"'not only lie themselves, but teach everybody else to do the same. He"
15444,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,has lamed me for life: I burn as if I had been shod at the
15445,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,blacksmith's forge.'
15446,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15447,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"The two friends said nothing about him, but continued the discourse"
15448,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,which his visit had interrupted.
15449,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15450,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ Turn again, I entreat you, to the serious; and do not"
15451,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"imagine that because by nature you are inclined to playfulness, you"
15452,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,must therefore write ludicrous things better. Many of your stories
15453,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"would make the gravest men laugh, and yet there is little wit in them."
15454,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15455,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ I think so myself; though authors, little disposed as"
15456,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,they are to doubt their possession of any quality they would bring
15457,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"into play, are least of all suspicious on the side of wit. You have"
15458,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"convinced me. I am glad to have been tender, and to have written"
15459,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,tenderly: for I am certain it is this alone that has made you love me
15460,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,with such affection.
15461,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15462,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Petrarca._ Not this alone, Giovanni! but this principally. I have"
15463,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"always found you kind and compassionate, liberal and sincere, and when"
15464,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Fortune does not stand very close to such a man, she leaves only the"
15465,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,more room for Friendship.
15466,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15467,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"_Boccaccio._ Let her stand off then, now and for ever! To my heart, to"
15468,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"my heart, Francesco! preserver of my health, my peace of mind, and"
15469,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,(since you tell me I may claim it) my glory.
15470,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15471,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Petrarca._ Recovering your strength you must pursue your studies to
15472,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,complete it. What can you have been doing with your books? I have
15473,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,searched in vain this morning for the treasury. Where are they kept?
15474,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"Formerly they were always open. I found only a short manuscript, which"
15475,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"I suspect is poetry, but I ventured not on looking into it, until I"
15476,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,had brought it with me and laid it before you.
15477,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15478,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,_Boccaccio._ Well guessed! They are verses written by a gentleman who
15479,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"resided long in this country, and who much regretted the necessity of"
15480,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"leaving it. He took great delight in composing both Latin and Italian,"
15481,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,"but never kept a copy of them latterly, so that these are the only"
15482,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,ones I could obtain from him. Read: for your voice will improve them:
15483,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15484,FIFTH DAY'S INTERVIEW,
15485,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,TO MY CHILD CARLINO
15486,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15487,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Carlino! what art thou about, my boy?"
15488,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Often I ask that question, though in vain,"
15489,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,For we are far apart: ah! therefore 'tis
15490,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,I often ask it; not in such a tone
15491,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"As wiser fathers do, who know too well."
15492,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Were we not children, you and I together?"
15493,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Stole we not glances from each other's eyes?
15494,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Swore we not secrecy in such misdeeds?
15495,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Well could we trust each other. Tell me then
15496,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"What thou art doing. Carving out thy name,"
15497,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Or haply mine, upon my favourite seat,"
15498,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,With the new knife I sent thee over sea?
15499,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Or hast thou broken it, and hid the hilt"
15500,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Among the myrtles, starr'd with flowers, behind?"
15501,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Or under that high throne whence fifty lilies
15502,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,(With sworded tuberoses dense around)
15503,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Lift up their heads at once, not without fear"
15504,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,That they were looking at thee all the while.
15505,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15506,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Does Cincirillo follow thee about?
15507,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Inverting one swart foot suspensively,"
15508,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,And wagging his dread jaw at every chirp
15509,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Of bird above him on the olive-branch?
15510,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Frighten him then away! 'twas he who slew
15511,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Our pigeons, our white pigeons peacock-tailed,"
15512,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"That fear'd not you and me ... alas, nor him!"
15513,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"I flattened his striped sides along my knee,"
15514,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"And reasoned with him on his bloody mind,"
15515,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Till he looked blandly, and half-closed his eyes"
15516,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,To ponder on my lecture in the shade.
15517,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"I doubt his memory much, his heart a little,"
15518,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,And in some minor matters (may I say it?)
15519,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Could wish him rather sager. But from thee
15520,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,God hold back wisdom yet for many years!
15521,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Whether in early season or in late
15522,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,It always comes high-priced. For thy pure breast
15523,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,I have no lesson; it for me has many.
15524,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Come throw it open then! What sports, what cares"
15525,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,(Since there are none too young for these) engage
15526,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Thy busy thoughts? Are you again at work,"
15527,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Walter and you, with those sly labourers,"
15528,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Geppo, Giovanni, Cecco, and Poeta,"
15529,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,To build more solidly your broken dam
15530,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Among the poplars, whence the nightingale"
15531,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Inquisitively watch'd you all day long?
15532,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"I was not of your council in the scheme,"
15533,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Or might have saved you silver without end,"
15534,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,And sighs too without number. Art thou gone
15535,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Below the mulberry, where that cold pool"
15536,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Urged to devise a warmer, and more fit"
15537,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"For mighty swimmers, swimming three abreast?"
15538,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Or art thou panting in this summer noon
15539,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Upon the lowest step before the hall,"
15540,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Drawing a slice of water-melon, long"
15541,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"As Cupid's bow, athwart thy wetted lips"
15542,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,(Like one who plays Pan's pipe) and letting drop
15543,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"The sable seeds from all their separate cells,"
15544,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"And leaving bays profound and rocks abrupt,"
15545,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Redder than coral round Calypso's cave?
15546,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15547,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ There have been those anciently who would have been
15548,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"pleased with such poetry, and perhaps there may be again. I am not"
15549,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"sorry to see the Muses by the side of childhood, and forming a part of"
15550,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,the family. But now tell me about the books.
15551,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15552,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Boccaccio._ Resolving to lay aside the more valuable of those I had
15553,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"collected or transcribed, and to place them under the guardianship of"
15554,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"richer men, I locked them up together in the higher story of my tower"
15555,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,at Certaldo. You remember the old tower?
15556,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15557,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ Well do I remember the hearty laugh we had together (which
15558,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"stopped us upon the staircase) at the calculation we made, how much"
15559,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"longer you and I, if we continued to thrive as we had thriven"
15560,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"latterly, should be able to pass within its narrow circle. Although I"
15561,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"like this little villa much better, I would gladly see the place"
15562,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"again, and enjoy with you, as we did before, the vast expanse of"
15563,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,woodlands and mountains and maremma; frowning fortresses inexpugnable;
15564,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"and others more prodigious for their ruins; then below them, lordly"
15565,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"abbeys, overcanopied with stately trees and girded with rich"
15566,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"luxuriance; and towns that seem approaching them to do them honour,"
15567,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,and villages nestling close at their sides for sustenance and
15568,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,protection.
15569,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15570,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Boccaccio._ My disorder, if it should keep its promise of leaving me"
15571,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"at last, will have been preparing me for the accomplishment of such a"
15572,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"project. Should I get thinner and thinner at this rate, I shall soon"
15573,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"be able to mount not only a turret or a belfry, but a tube of"
15574,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"macarone, while a Neapolitan is suspending it for deglutition."
15575,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15576,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,What I am about to mention will show you how little you can rely on
15577,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"me! I have preserved the books, as you desired, but quite contrary to"
15578,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"my resolution: and, no less contrary to it, by your desire I shall now"
15579,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,preserve the _Decameron_. In vain had I determined not only to mend in
15580,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"future, but to correct the past; in vain had I prayed most fervently"
15581,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"for grace to accomplish it, with a final aspiration to Fiametta that"
15582,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"she would unite with your beloved Laura, and that, gentle and"
15583,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"beatified spirits as they are, they would breathe together their purer"
15584,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,prayers on mine. See what follows.
15585,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15586,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ Sigh not at it. Before we can see all that follows from
15587,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"their intercession, we must join them again. But let me hear anything"
15588,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,in which they are concerned.
15589,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15590,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Boccaccio._ I prayed; and my breast, after some few tears, grew"
15591,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"calmer. Yet sleep did not ensue until the break of morning, when the"
15592,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"dropping of soft rain on the leaves of the fig-tree at the window, and"
15593,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"the chirping of a little bird, to tell another there was shelter under"
15594,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"them, brought me repose and slumber. Scarcely had I closed my eyes, if"
15595,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"indeed time can be reckoned any more in sleep than in heaven, when my"
15596,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Fiametta seemed to have led me into the meadow. You will see it below
15597,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,you: turn away that branch: gently! gently! do not break it; for the
15598,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,little bird sat there.
15599,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15600,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Petrarca._ I think, Giovanni, I can divine the place. Although this"
15601,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"fig-tree, growing out of the wall between the cellar and us, is"
15602,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"fantastic enough in its branches, yet that other which I see yonder,"
15603,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,bent down and forced to crawl along the grass by the prepotency of the
15604,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"young shapely walnut-tree, is much more so. It forms a seat, about a"
15605,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"cubit above the ground, level and long enough for several."
15606,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15607,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Boccaccio._ Ha! you fancy it must be a favourite spot with me,"
15608,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,because of the two strong forked stakes wherewith it is propped and
15609,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,supported!
15610,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15611,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ Poets know the haunts of poets at first sight; and he who
15612,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,loved Laura.... O Laura! did I say he who _loved_ thee? ... hath
15613,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,whisperings where those feet would wander which have been restless
15614,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,after Fiametta.
15615,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15616,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Boccaccio._ It is true, my imagination has often conducted her"
15617,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,thither; but there in this chamber she appeared to me more visibly in
15618,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,a dream.
15619,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15620,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'Thy prayers have been heard, O Giovanni,' said she."
15621,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15622,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,I sprang to embrace her.
15623,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15624,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,'Do not spill the water! Ah! you have spilt a part of it.'
15625,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15626,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,I then observed in her hand a crystal vase. A few drops were sparkling
15627,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,on the sides and running down the rim: a few were trickling from the
15628,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,base and from the hand that held it.
15629,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15630,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'I must go down to the brook,' said she, 'and fill it again as it was"
15631,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,filled before.'
15632,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15633,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,What a moment of agony was this to me! Could I be certain how long
15634,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,might be her absence? She went: I was following: she made a sign for
15635,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,me to turn back: I disobeyed her only an instant: yet my sense of
15636,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"disobedience, increasing my feebleness and confusion, made me lose"
15637,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"sight of her. In the next moment she was again at my side, with the"
15638,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,cup quite full. I stood motionless: I feared my breath might shake the
15639,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,water over. I looked her in the face for her commands ... and to see
15640,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"it ... to see it so calm, so beneficent, so beautiful. I was"
15641,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"forgetting what I had prayed for, when she lowered her head, tasted of"
15642,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"the cup, and gave it me. I drank; and suddenly sprang forth before me"
15643,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"many groves and palaces and gardens, and their statues and their"
15644,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"avenues, and their labyrinths of alaternus and bay, and alcoves of"
15645,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"citron, and watchful loopholes in the retirements of impenetrable"
15646,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"pomegranate. Farther off, just below where the fountain slipped away"
15647,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"from its marble hall and guardian gods, arose, from their beds of moss"
15648,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"and drosera and darkest grass, the sisterhood of oleanders, fond of"
15649,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,tantalizing with their bosomed flowers and their moist and pouting
15650,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"blossoms the little shy rivulet, and of covering its face with all the"
15651,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,colours of the dawn. My dream expanded and moved forward. I trod again
15652,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"the dust of Posilipo, soft as the feathers in the wings of Sleep. I"
15653,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,emerged on Baia; I crossed her innumerable arches; I loitered in the
15654,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,breezy sunshine of her mole; I trusted the faithful seclusion of her
15655,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"caverns, the keepers of so many secrets; and I reposed on the buoyancy"
15656,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"of her tepid sea. Then Naples, and her theatres and her churches, and"
15657,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"grottoes and dells and forts and promontories, rushed forward in"
15658,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"confusion, now among soft whispers, now among sweetest sounds, and"
15659,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"subsided, and sank, and disappeared. Yet a memory seemed to come fresh"
15660,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"from every one: each had time enough for its tale, for its pleasure,"
15661,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"for its reflection, for its pang. As I mounted with silent steps the"
15662,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"narrow staircase of the old palace, how distinctly did I feel against"
15663,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"the palm of my hand the coldness of that smooth stone-work, and the"
15664,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,greater of the cramps of iron in it!
15665,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15666,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,'Ah me! is this forgetting?' cried I anxiously to Fiametta.
15667,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15668,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'We must recall these scenes before us,' she replied: 'such is the"
15669,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"punishment of them. Let us hope and believe that the apparition, and"
15670,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"the compunction which must follow it, will be accepted as the full"
15671,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"penalty, and that both will pass away almost together.'"
15672,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15673,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,I feared to lose anything attendant on her presence: I feared to
15674,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,approach her forehead with my lips: I feared to touch the lily on its
15675,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"long wavy leaf in her hair, which filled my whole heart with"
15676,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"fragrance. Venerating, adoring, I bowed my head at last to kiss her"
15677,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"snow-white robe, and trembled at my presumption. And yet the"
15678,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,effulgence of her countenance vivified while it chastened me. I loved
15679,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,her ... I must not say _more_ than ever ... _better_ than ever; it was
15680,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Fiametta who had inhabited the skies. As my hand opened toward her:
15681,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15682,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'Beware!' said she, faintly smiling; 'beware, Giovanni! Take only the"
15683,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"crystal; take it, and drink again.'"
15684,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15685,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,'Must all be then forgotten?' said I sorrowfully.
15686,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15687,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'Remember your prayer and mine, Giovanni. Shall both have been"
15688,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"granted ... oh, how much worse than in vain?'"
15689,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15690,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,I drank instantly; I drank largely. How cool my bosom grew; how could
15691,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,it grow so cool before her! But it was not to remain in its
15692,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"quiescency; its trials were not yet over. I will not, Francesco! no, I"
15693,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"may not commemorate the incidents she related to me, nor which of us"
15694,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"said, 'I blush for having loved _first_;' nor which of us replied,"
15695,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'Say _least_, say _least_, and blush again.'"
15696,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15697,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,The charm of the words (for I felt not the encumbrance of the body nor
15698,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,the acuteness of the spirit) seemed to possess me wholly. Although the
15699,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"water gave me strength and comfort, and somewhat of celestial"
15700,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"pleasure, many tears fell around the border of the vase as she held it"
15701,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"up before me, exhorting me to take courage, and inviting me with more"
15702,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"than exhortation to accomplish my deliverance. She came nearer, more"
15703,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"tenderly, more earnestly; she held the dewy globe with both hands,"
15704,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"leaning forward, and sighed and shook her head, drooping at my"
15705,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"pusillanimity. It was only when a ringlet had touched the rim, and"
15706,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,perhaps the water (for a sunbeam on the surface could never have given
15707,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"it such a golden hue), that I took courage, clasped it, and exhausted"
15708,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"it. Sweet as was the water, sweet as was the serenity it gave me ..."
15709,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,alas! that also which it moved away from me was sweet!
15710,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15711,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'This time you can trust me alone,' said she, and parted my hair, and"
15712,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"kissed my brow. Again she went toward the brook: again my agitation,"
15713,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"my weakness, my doubt, came over me: nor could I see her while she"
15714,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"raised the water, nor knew I whence she drew it. When she returned,"
15715,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,she was close to me at once: she smiled: her smile pierced me to the
15716,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,bones: it seemed an angel's. She sprinkled the pure water on me; she
15717,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,looked most fondly; she took my hand; she suffered me to press hers to
15718,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"my bosom; but, whether by design I cannot tell, she let fall a few"
15719,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,drops of the chilly element between.
15720,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15721,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'And now, O my beloved!' said she, 'we have consigned to the bosom of"
15722,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"God our earthly joys and sorrows. The joys cannot return, let not the"
15723,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,sorrows. These alone would trouble my repose among the blessed.'
15724,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15725,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,'Trouble thy repose! Fiametta! Give me the chalice!' cried I ... 'not
15726,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"a drop will I leave in it, not a drop.'"
15727,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15728,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,'Take it!' said that soft voice. 'O now most dear Giovanni! I know
15729,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,thou hast strength enough; and there is but little ... at the bottom
15730,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,lies our first kiss.'
15731,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15732,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'Mine! didst thou say, beloved one? and is that left thee still?'"
15733,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15734,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'_Mine_,' said she, pensively; and as she abased her head, the broad"
15735,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,leaf of the lily hid her brow and her eyes; the light of heaven shone
15736,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,through the flower.
15737,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15738,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'O Fiametta! Fiametta!' cried I in agony, 'God is the God of mercy,"
15739,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"God is the God of love ... can I, can I ever?' I struck the chalice"
15740,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"against my head, unmindful that I held it; the water covered my face"
15741,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"and my feet. I started up, not yet awake, and I heard the name of"
15742,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Fiametta in the curtains.
15743,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15744,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Petrarca._ Love, O Giovanni, and life itself, are but dreams at best."
15745,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,I do think
15746,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15747,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Never so gloriously was Sleep attended
15748,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,As with the pageant of that heavenly maid.
15749,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15750,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"But to dwell on such subjects is sinful. The recollection of them,"
15751,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"with all their vanities, brings tears into my eyes."
15752,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15753,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Boccaccio._ And into mine too ... they were so very charming.
15754,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15755,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Petrarca._ Alas, alas! the time always comes when we must regret the"
15756,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,enjoyments of our youth.
15757,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15758,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Boccaccio._ If we have let them pass us.
15759,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15760,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ I mean our indulgence in them.
15761,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15762,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Boccaccio._ Francesco! I think you must remember Raffaellino degli
15763,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Alfani.
15764,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15765,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ Was it Raffaellino who lived near San Michele in Orto?
15766,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15767,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Boccaccio._ The same. He was an innocent soul, and fond of fish. But"
15768,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"whenever his friend Sabbatelli sent him a trout from Pratolino, he"
15769,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"always kept it until next day or the day after, just long enough to"
15770,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"render it unpalatable. He then turned it over in the platter, smelt at"
15771,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"it closer, although the news of its condition came undeniably from a"
15772,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"distance, touched it with his forefinger, solicited a testimony from"
15773,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"the gills which the eyes had contradicted, sighed over it, and sent it"
15774,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,for a present to somebody else. Were I a lover of trout as Raffaellino
15775,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"was, I think I should have taken an opportunity of enjoying it while"
15776,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,the pink and crimson were glittering on it.
15777,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15778,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Petrarca._ Trout, yes."
15779,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15780,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Boccaccio._ And all other fish I could encompass.
15781,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15782,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ O thou grave mocker! I did not suspect such slyness in
15783,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,thee: proof enough I had almost forgotten thee.
15784,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15785,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Boccaccio._ Listen! listen! I fancied I caught a footstep in the
15786,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"passage. Come nearer; bend your head lower, that I may whisper a word"
15787,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,in your ear. Never let Assunta hear you sigh. She is mischievous: she
15788,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,may have been standing at the door: not that I believe she would be
15789,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,guilty of any such impropriety: but who knows what girls are capable
15790,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"of! She has no malice, only in laughing; and a sigh sets her windmill"
15791,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"at work, van over van, incessantly."
15792,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15793,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ I should soon check her. I have no notion....
15794,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15795,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Boccaccio._ After all, she is a good girl ... a trifle of the wilful."
15796,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,She must have it that many things are hurtful to me ... reading in
15797,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,particular ... it makes people so odd. Tina is a small matter of the
15798,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"madcap ... in her own particular way ... but exceedingly discreet, I"
15799,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"do assure you, if they will only leave her alone."
15800,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15801,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"I find I was mistaken, there was nobody."
15802,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15803,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Petrarca._ A cat, perhaps."
15804,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15805,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Boccaccio._ No such thing. I order him over to Certaldo while the
15806,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"birds are laying and sitting: and he knows by experience, favourite as"
15807,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"he is, that it is of no use to come back before he is sent for. Since"
15808,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"the first impetuosities of youth, he has rarely been refractory or"
15809,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"disobliging. We have lived together now these five years, unless I"
15810,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"miscalculate; and he seems to have learnt something of my manners,"
15811,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,wherein violence and enterprise by no means predominate. I have
15812,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"watched him looking at a large green lizard; and, their eyes being"
15813,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"opposite and near, he has doubted whether it might be pleasing to me"
15814,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,if he began the attack; and their tails on a sudden have touched one
15815,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,another at the decision.
15816,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15817,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ Seldom have adverse parties felt the same desire of peace
15818,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"at the same moment, and none ever carried it more simultaneously and"
15819,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,promptly into execution.
15820,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15821,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Boccaccio._ He enjoys his _otium cum dignitate_ at Certaldo: there he
15822,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"is my castellan, and his chase is unlimited in those domains. After"
15823,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"the doom of relegation is expired, he comes hither at midsummer. And"
15824,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"then if you could see his joy! His eyes are as deep as a well, and as"
15825,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,clear as a fountain: he jerks his tail into the air like a royal
15826,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"sceptre, and waves it like the wand of a magician. You would fancy"
15827,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"that, as Horace with his head, he was about to smite the stars with"
15828,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"it. There is ne'er such another cat in the parish; and he knows it, a"
15829,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"rogue! We have rare repasts together in the bean-and-bacon time,"
15830,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,although in regard to the bean he sides with the philosopher of Samos;
15831,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,but after due examination. In cleanliness he is a very nun; albeit in
15832,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"that quality which lies between cleanliness and godliness, there is a"
15833,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,smack of Fra Biagio about him. What is that book in your hand?
15834,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15835,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ My breviary.
15836,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15837,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Boccaccio._ Well, give me mine too ... there, on the little table in"
15838,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"the corner, under the glass of primroses. We can do nothing better."
15839,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15840,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ What prayer were you looking for? let me find it.
15841,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15842,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Boccaccio._ I don't know how it is: I am scarcely at present in a
15843,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,frame of mind for it. We are of one faith: the prayers of the one will
15844,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"do for the other: and I am sure, if you omitted my name, you would say"
15845,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,them all over afresh. I wish you could recollect in any book as dreamy
15846,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,a thing to entertain me as I have been just repeating. We have had
15847,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,enough of Dante: I believe few of his beauties have escaped us: and
15848,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"small faults, which we readily pass by, are fitter for small folks, as"
15849,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,grubs are the proper bait for gudgeons.
15850,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15851,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ I have had as many dreams as most men. We are all made up
15852,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"of them, as the webs of the spider are particles of her own vitality."
15853,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"But how infinitely less do we profit by them! I will relate to you,"
15854,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"before we separate, one among the multitude of mine, as coming the"
15855,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"nearest to the poetry of yours, and as having been not totally useless"
15856,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"to me. Often have I reflected on it; sometimes with pensiveness, with"
15857,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,sadness never.
15858,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15859,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Boccaccio._ Then, Francesco, if you had with you as copious a choice"
15860,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"of dreams as clustered on the elm-trees where the Sibyl led Aeneas,"
15861,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"this, in preference to the whole swarm of them, is the queen dream for"
15862,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,me.
15863,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15864,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ When I was younger I was fond of wandering in solitary
15865,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"places, and never was afraid of slumbering in woods and grottoes."
15866,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Among the chief pleasures of my life, and among the commonest of my"
15867,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"occupations, was the bringing before me such heroes and heroines of"
15868,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"antiquity, such poets and sages, such of the prosperous and the"
15869,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"unfortunate, as most interested me by their courage, their wisdom,"
15870,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"their eloquence, or their adventures. Engaging them in the"
15871,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"conversation best suited to their characters, I knew perfectly their"
15872,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"manners, their steps, their voices: and often did I moisten with my"
15873,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,tears the models I had been forming of the less happy.
15874,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15875,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Boccaccio._ Great is the privilege of entering into the studies of
15876,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,the intellectual; great is that of conversing with the guides of
15877,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"nations, the movers of the mass, the regulators of the unruly will,"
15878,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"stiff, in its impurity and rust, against the finger of the Almighty"
15879,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Power that formed it: but give me, Francesco, give me rather the"
15880,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,creature to sympathize with; apportion me the sufferings to assuage.
15881,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Ah, gentle soul! thou wilt never send them over to another; they have"
15882,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,better hopes from thee.
15883,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15884,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ We both alike feel the sorrows of those around us. He who
15885,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"suppresses or allays them in another, breaks many thorns off his own;"
15886,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,and future years will never harden fresh ones.
15887,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15888,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"My occupation was not always in making the politician talk politics,"
15889,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"the orator toss his torch among the populace, the philosopher run down"
15890,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,from philosophy to cover the retreat or the advances of his sect; but
15891,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"sometimes in devising how such characters must act and discourse, on"
15892,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,subjects far remote from the beaten track of their career. In like
15893,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"manner the philologist, and again the dialectician, were not indulged"
15894,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"in the review and parade of their trained bands, but, at times,"
15895,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,brought forward to show in what manner and in what degree external
15896,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,habits had influenced the conformation of the internal man. It was far
15897,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"from unprofitable to set passing events before past actors, and to"
15898,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,record the decisions of those whose interests and passions are
15899,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,unconcerned in them.
15900,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15901,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Boccaccio._ This is surely no easy matter. The thoughts are in fact
15902,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"your own, however you distribute them."
15903,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15904,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,_Petrarca._ All cannot be my own; if you mean by _thoughts_ the
15905,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,opinions and principles I should be the most desirous to inculcate.
15906,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Some favourite ones perhaps may obtrude too prominently, but otherwise"
15907,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,no misbehaviour is permitted them: reprehension and rebuke are always
15908,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"ready, and the offence is punished on the spot."
15909,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15910,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Boccaccio._ Certainly you thus throw open, to its full extent, the"
15911,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,range of poetry and invention; which cannot but be very limited and
15912,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"sterile, unless where we find displayed much diversity of character as"
15913,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"disseminated by nature, much peculiarity of sentiment as arising from"
15914,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"position, marked with unerring skill through every shade and"
15915,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"gradation; and finally and chiefly, much intertexture and intensity of"
15916,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,passion. You thus convey to us more largely and expeditiously the
15917,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"stores of your understanding and imagination, than you ever could by"
15918,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"sonnets or canzonets, or sinewless and sapless allegories."
15919,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15920,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,But weightier works are less captivating. If you had published any
15921,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"such as you mention, you must have waited for their acceptance. Not"
15922,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"only the fame of Marcellus, but every other,"
15923,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15924,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Crescit occulto velut arbor aevo;
15925,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15926,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,and that which makes the greatest vernal shoot is apt to make the
15927,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"least autumnal. Authors in general who have met celebrity at starting,"
15928,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"have already had their reward; always their utmost due, and often much"
15929,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,beyond it. We cannot hope for both celebrity and fame: supremely
15930,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,fortunate are the few who are allowed the liberty of choice between
15931,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"them. We two prefer the strength that springs from exercise and toil,"
15932,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,acquiring it gradually and slowly: we leave to others the earlier
15933,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,blessing of that sleep which follows enjoyment. How many at first
15934,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,sight are enthusiastic in their favour! Of these how large a portion
15935,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,come away empty-handed and discontented! like idlers who visit the
15936,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"seacoast, fill their pockets with pebbles bright from the passing"
15937,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"wave, and carry them off with rapture. After a short examination at"
15938,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"home, every streak seems faint and dull, and the whole contexture"
15939,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"coarse, uneven, and gritty: first one is thrown away, then another;"
15940,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"and before the week's end the store is gone, of things so shining and"
15941,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,wonderful.
15942,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15943,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"_Petrarca._ Allegory, which you named with sonnets and canzonets, had"
15944,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"few attractions for me, believing it to be the delight in general of"
15945,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"idle, frivolous, inexcursive minds, in whose mansions there is neither"
15946,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,hall nor portal to receive the loftier of the Passions. A stranger to
15947,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"the Affections, she holds a low station among the handmaidens of"
15948,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Poetry, being fit for little but an apparition in a mask. I had"
15949,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"reflected for some time on this subject, when, wearied with the length"
15950,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"of my walk over the mountains, and finding a soft old molehill,"
15951,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"covered with grey grass, by the wayside, I laid my head upon it and"
15952,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,slept. I cannot tell how long it was before a species of dream or
15953,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,vision came over me.
15954,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15955,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Two beautiful youths appeared beside me; each was winged; but the
15956,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"wings were hanging down, and seemed ill adapted to flight. One of"
15957,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"them, whose voice was the softest I ever heard, looking at me"
15958,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"frequently, said to the other:"
15959,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15960,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,'He is under my guardianship for the present: do not awaken him with
15961,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,that feather.'
15962,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15963,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Methought, hearing the whisper, I saw something like the feather on an"
15964,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"arrow; and then the arrow itself; the whole of it, even to the point;"
15965,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,although he carried it in such a manner that it was difficult at first
15966,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"to discover more than a palm's length of it: the rest of the shaft,"
15967,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"and the whole of the barb, was behind his ankles."
15968,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15969,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'This feather never awakens any one,' replied he, rather petulantly;"
15970,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'but it brings more of confident security, and more of cherished"
15971,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"dreams, than you without me are capable of imparting.'"
15972,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15973,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,'Be it so!' answered the gentler ... 'none is less inclined to quarrel
15974,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"or dispute than I am. Many whom you have wounded grievously, call upon"
15975,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"me for succour. But so little am I disposed to thwart you, it is"
15976,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,seldom I venture to do more for them than to whisper a few words of
15977,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,comfort in passing. How many reproaches on these occasions have been
15978,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"cast upon me for indifference and infidelity! Nearly as many, and"
15979,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"nearly in the same terms, as upon you!'"
15980,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
15981,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'Odd enough that we, O Sleep! should be thought so alike,' said Love,"
15982,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,contemptuously. 'Yonder is he who bears a nearer resemblance to you:
15983,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,the dullest have observed it.' I fancied I turned my eyes to where he
15984,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"was pointing, and saw at a distance the figure he designated."
15985,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,Meanwhile the contention went on uninterruptedly. Sleep was slow in
15986,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,asserting his power or his benefits. Love recapitulated them; but only
15987,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,that he might assert his own above them. Suddenly he called on me to
15988,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"decide, and to choose my patron. Under the influence, first of the"
15989,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"one, then of the other, I sprang from repose to rapture, I alighted"
15990,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,from rapture on repose ... and knew not which was sweetest. Love was
15991,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"very angry with me, and declared he would cross me throughout the"
15992,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,whole of my existence. Whatever I might on other occasions have
15993,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"thought of his veracity, I now felt too surely the conviction that he"
15994,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"would keep his word. At last, before the close of the altercation, the"
15995,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"third Genius had advanced, and stood near us. I cannot tell how I knew"
15996,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"him, but I knew him to be the Genius of Death. Breathless as I was at"
15997,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"beholding him, I soon became familiar with his features. First they"
15998,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,seemed only calm; presently they grew contemplative; and lastly
15999,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"beautiful: those of the Graces themselves are less regular, less"
16000,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"harmonious, less composed. Love glanced at him unsteadily, with a"
16001,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"countenance in which there was somewhat of anxiety, somewhat of"
16002,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"disdain; and cried: 'Go away! go away! nothing that thou touchest,"
16003,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,lives.'
16004,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
16005,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'Say rather, child!' replied the advancing form, and advancing grew"
16006,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"loftier and statelier, 'say rather that nothing of beautiful or of"
16007,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,glorious lives its own true life until my wing hath passed over it.'
16008,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
16009,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Love pouted, and rumpled and bent down with his forefinger the stiff"
16010,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,short feathers on his arrow-head; but replied not. Although he frowned
16011,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"worse than ever, and at me, I dreaded him less and less, and scarcely"
16012,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"looked toward him. The milder and calmer Genius, the third, in"
16013,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"proportion as I took courage to contemplate him, regarded me with more"
16014,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"and more complacency. He held neither flower nor arrow, as the others"
16015,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"did; but, throwing back the clusters of dark curls that overshadowed"
16016,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"his countenance, he presented to me his hand, openly and benignly. I"
16017,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"shrank on looking at him so near, and yet I sighed to love him. He"
16018,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"smiled, not without an expression of pity, at perceiving my"
16019,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"diffidence, my timidity: for I remembered how soft was the hand of"
16020,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"Sleep, how warm and entrancing was Love's. By degrees, I became"
16021,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"ashamed of my ingratitude; and turning my face away, I held out my"
16022,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"arms, and felt my neck within his. Composure strewed and allayed all"
16023,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,the throbbings of my bosom; the coolness of freshest morning breathed
16024,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,around: the heavens seemed to open above me; while the beautiful cheek
16025,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,of my deliverer rested on my head. I would now have looked for those
16026,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"others; but knowing my intention by my gesture, he said,"
16027,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,consolatorily:
16028,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
16029,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'Sleep is on his way to the Earth, where many are calling him; but it"
16030,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,is not to these he hastens; for every call only makes him fly farther
16031,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"off. Sedately and gravely as he looks, he is nearly as capricious and"
16032,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,volatile as the more arrogant and ferocious one.'
16033,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
16034,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'And Love!' said I, 'whither is he departed? If not too late, I would"
16035,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,propitiate and appease him.'
16036,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
16037,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"'He who cannot follow me, he who cannot overtake and pass me,' said"
16038,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"the Genius, 'is unworthy of the name, the most glorious in earth or"
16039,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"heaven. Look up! Love is yonder, and ready to receive thee.'"
16040,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,
16041,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,"I looked: the earth was under me: I saw only the clear blue sky, and"
16042,TO MY CHILD CARLINO,something brighter above it.

16254,XII,Show'd she disliked resistance to her will:
16255,XII,"But when they droopt their heads and shone much less,"
16256,XII,"She shook them to and fro, and threw them by,"
16257,XII,And tript away. 'Ye loathe the heaviness

16312,XV,
16313,XV,And am beginning to opine
