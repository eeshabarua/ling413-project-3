1,A BALLAD,THE GIANT OF BERN AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE A BALLAD 
2,GEORGE BORROW,BY GEORGE BORROW 
3,PRINTED FOR PRIVATE CIRCULATION,LONDON: PRINTED FOR PRIVATE CIRCULATION 1913 
4,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,THE GIANT OF BERN AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE 
5,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"It was the lofty Jutt of Bern O'er all the walls he grew; He was mad and ne'er at rest, To tame him no one knew. "
6,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"He was mad and ne'er at rest, No lord could hold him in; If he had long in Denmark stayed Much damage there had been. "
7,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"It was the lofty Jutt of Bern Bound to his side his glaive, And away to the monarch's house he rode With the knights a fray to have. "
8,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Now goes the lofty Jutt of Bern Before the King to stand: ""Thou shalt to me thy daughter give, And a brief for half thy land. "
9,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Here as thou sitt'st at thy wide board, Hail Monarch of the Danes! Thou shalt to me thy daughter give, And the half of thy domains. "
10,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Thou shalt to me thy daughter give, And divide with me thy land, Or thou shalt find a kempion good In the ring 'gainst me to stand."" "
11,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""O thou shalt ne'er my daughter get, Nor a brief for half my land, I'll quickly find a kempion good Shall fight thee hand to hand."" "
12,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Then strode the Monarch of the Danes To his castle hall amain: ""Now which of ye, my courtiers, will The lovely Damsel gain? "
13,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Here sit ye all my Danish swains On whom I bread bestow, Now which of ye will risk his life To lay the Berner low? "
14,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""I'll give to him my daughter dear, The wondrous lovely may, Who in the ring with Jutt of Bern Shall dare the desperate fray."" "
15,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"In silence all the kempions sat, None dared reply a word, Except alone Orm Ungerswayne, The lowest at the board. "
16,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Except alone Orm Ungerswayne, He bounded o'er the board: I tell to ye in verity He spake a manly word. "
17,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Wilt thou to me thy daughter give, And divide with me thy land? O then will I the kempion be, Against the Jutt to stand. "
18,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""And well will I your daughter win, And the prize alone will earn; I am the lad to dare the fray In the ring with the Jutt of Bern."" "
19,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"It was the lofty Jutt of Bern He o'er his shoulder glar'd: ""O who may yonder mouseling be, From whom those words I heard?"" "
20,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""No mouseling I, though call me, Jutt, A mouseling if you will, My father was good Sigurd King Who slumbers in his hill."" "
21,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Ha! was thy sire good Sigurd King? Thou'st something of his face, Thou hast sprung up full wondrously In fifteen winter's space."" "
22,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"It was so late at evening tide The sun had reached the wave, When Orm the youthful swain set out To seek his father's grave. "
23,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"It was the hour when grooms do ride The coursers to the rill, That Orm set out resolved to wake The dead man in the hill. "
24,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Now strikes the bold Orm Ungerswayne The hill with such a might, It was I ween a miracle It tumbled not outright. "
25,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Then stamped upon the hill so hard Young Orm with heavy foot, The arch was broke within the hill Which trembled to its root. "
26,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Then from the hill Orm's father cried, Where he so long had lain: ""O cannot I in quiet lie Within my murky den? "
27,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Who dares so early break my rest, And troubleth thus my bones? Cannot I in quiet lie Beneath my roof of stones? "
28,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Who seeks at night the dead man's hill And works this ruin all? Let him fear for now I swear By Birting he shall fall."" "
29,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""I am thy son, thy youngest son, Thy Orm, O father dear; To beg a boon in mighty need I come to seek thee here."" "
30,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""If thou art Orm my youngest son, The kempion bold and brave, Last year I gave to thee of gold, All, all thy heart could crave."" "
31,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Last year you gave me store of gold On which I set no worth, Now I this year must Birting have, The bravest sword on earth."" "
32,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Never shalt thou Birting get To win the Monarch's daughter, Until to Ireland thou hast been To 'venge thy father's slaughter."" "
33,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Give to me the Birting sword, And with it bid me thrive, Or I the hill above thee will To thousand pieces rive."" "
34,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Stretch thou down thy hand and take My Birting from my side, But if thou break thy father's hill Much woe will thee betide."" "
35,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"He cast to him the sword, its point Appeared above the mould: ""Save good fate on thee shall wait I ne'er shall be consol'd."" "
36,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"He reached to him the sword, and placed Its hilt within his grasp: ""Beneath its blows may all thy foes Before thee sink and grasp."" "
37,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Then took the sword Orm Ungerswayne, And on his shoulder plac'd; And to the Monarch's hall he sped, As fast as he could haste. "
38,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"It was the lofty Jutt of Bern With wrath was nearly wild: ""It ill becomes a man like me To battle with a child."" "
39,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""Although I be but little, Jutt, A fearless heart I keep, And oftentimes a little hand O'erturns a mighty heap."" "
40,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"For two long days they fought, and when The third to evening tended, ""Methinks,"" exclaim'd the Berner Jutt, ""This fight will ne'er be ended."" "
41,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"It was bold Orm Ungerswayne His good sword brandish'd he, And of the lofty Berner Jutt Asunder cut the knee. "
42,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Loud bellowed then the Berner Jutt, And loud he fell to ban: ""It ne'er was warrior custom yet So low to strike one's man."" "
43,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""I was small, and thou wast tall, Thy prowess I admire; I only struck thy knee because I could not reach thee higher."" "
44,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Then took the bold Orm Ungerswayne His faulchion on his back, And to the ocean strand he goes As fast as he could make. "
45,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"It was bold Orm Ungerswayne He paced the yellow sand, And lo! Sir Tord of Valland came Swift sailing to the land. "
46,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Foremost upon the gilded prow The Tord of Valland stands: ""O who is yonder little man That walks upon the sands?"" "
47,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""O I am Orm, the youthful swain, A kempion bold and fine; 'Twas I that slew the Berner Jutt, That uncle dear of thine."" "
48,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"""If thou hast slain the Berner Jutt, That uncle dear of mine, 'Twas I the King of Ireland slew, Beloved father thine."" "
49,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"It was Tord of Valland then With faulchion struck the earth: ""Never will I make amends By gold or money's worth."" "
50,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"It was bold Orm Ungerswayne, He grasped his faulchion's hilt: ""In vengeance for my father then Shall valiant blood be spilt."" "
51,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"It was the bold Orm Ungerswayne He drew his trusty sword, And at a single blow smote off The head of Valland's Tord. "
52,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Valland's Tord he slew, and then His followers every one; Then speeds he to the monarch's house To claim the maid he'd won. "
53,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"Then took the bold Orm Ungerswayne The Atheling in his arm: ""Thou art my own, fair maid, for thee I have confronted harm."" "
54,AND ORM UNGERSWAYNE,"O'er Helmer Isle the tidings run As fast as levin fire, That Orm the lovely maid has won, And has avenged his sire. "
