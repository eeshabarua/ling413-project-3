38,PREFACE.,
39,PREFACE.,"A small volume of poems entitled, ""Home Here and Home in Heaven,"" by"
40,PREFACE.,"Annie R. Smith, appeared shortly after her death, in 1855. Her numerous"
41,PREFACE.,"friends wishing some account of her life and last sickness, have from"
42,PREFACE.,time to time desired me to prepare such a sketch for publication. I have
43,PREFACE.,"also been requested to publish in connection therewith, a collection of"
44,PREFACE.,my own poetical efforts. This is the immediate occasion of the appearance
45,PREFACE.,"of the present volume, the publication of which, circumstances have"
46,PREFACE.,conspired to delay till the present time. It lays no claim to literary
47,PREFACE.,"merit, but professes to be only a description in rhyme of some of the"
48,PREFACE.,"ordinary experiences of life, and the common feelings of the heart. I"
49,PREFACE.,"have appended some additional pieces written by Annie R. Smith, and some"
50,PREFACE.,"by Uriah Smith, which I have desired to see published in this form. It is"
51,PREFACE.,"commended to the charitable consideration of friends, with the hope that"
52,PREFACE.,its appearance may prove a gratification and a benefit to some.

62,POEMS.,
63,POEMS.,
64,POEMS.,
65,POEMS.,
66,POEMS.,Life's Conflict.
67,POEMS.,
68,POEMS.,
69,POEMS.,"In the deep recess of the inmost heart,"
70,POEMS.,"Where Satan tempts and angels come to shield,"
71,POEMS.,"Are foes by which we would be overcome,"
72,POEMS.,Were Christ not with us on the battle-field.
73,POEMS.,
74,POEMS.,"The tempter, seeking whom he may devour,"
75,POEMS.,"Would sift as wheat, and finally prevail;"
76,POEMS.,"But Jesus intercedes and prays for us,"
77,POEMS.,That faith in these dread conflicts may not fail.
78,POEMS.,
79,POEMS.,"These calls unheeded, who the end can know?"
80,POEMS.,"The Spirit grieved and angels forced to leave,"
81,POEMS.,"The victims, though unconscious, hastening where"
82,POEMS.,"No pardoning love is found, and no reprieve."
83,POEMS.,
84,POEMS.,"If yet there's hope, one mighty effort make"
85,POEMS.,"To conquer, and the enemy defeat;"
86,POEMS.,"Watch unto prayer, in Jesus Christ abide,"
87,POEMS.,And hasten to be made in him complete.
88,POEMS.,
89,POEMS.,No true enjoyment here aside from this.
90,POEMS.,"No other name on earth e'er to be given,"
91,POEMS.,"Through him we must be cleansed and purified,"
92,POEMS.,Or closed to us will be the gates of Heaven.
93,POEMS.,
94,POEMS.,
95,POEMS.,
96,POEMS.,
97,POEMS.,Christian Love.
98,POEMS.,
99,POEMS.,
100,POEMS.,"Jesus sees, he feels, he pities; he for us keen anguish knew,"
101,POEMS.,"He was numbered with transgressors; harmless, but his friends were few."
102,POEMS.,"Those immersed in love's deep ocean, nothing will or can offend;"
103,POEMS.,"They will bow in sweet submission, knowing Heaven will them defend."
104,POEMS.,
105,POEMS.,Let us then our suffering brother seek where'er his lot is cast;
106,POEMS.,"Priests and Levites having seen him, on the other side have passed;"
107,POEMS.,But of God he's not forsaken; He has known each bitter pang;
108,POEMS.,"He has seen his tears and sorrows, and has known from whence they"
109,POEMS.,sprang.
110,POEMS.,
111,POEMS.,"Jesus sees when best to succor, every wrong will bring to light;"
112,POEMS.,"He will have obedient children who in doing good delight,"
113,POEMS.,"Who will move in love and pity, bleeding wounds to soothe and bind,"
114,POEMS.,"Good Samaritans, who ever seek some path of love to find."
115,POEMS.,
116,POEMS.,"Courage new is then imparted, chilling words no more oppress;"
117,POEMS.,"Oh! for more true kindred spirits, who would make our sufferings less."
118,POEMS.,Lord forgive thine erring people; form them for thyself alone;
119,POEMS.,"Then they'll bear each other's burdens, calling nought they have their"
120,POEMS.,own.
121,POEMS.,
122,POEMS.,"Then each suffering child of sorrow would be watched with tender care,"
123,POEMS.,Love and pity for the erring would be felt and witnessed there.
124,POEMS.,Strife and jealousy would vanish; love be felt that works no ill;
125,POEMS.,"Peace, sweet peace, and joy and gladness, would each home and bosom"
126,POEMS.,fill.
127,POEMS.,
128,POEMS.,
129,POEMS.,
130,POEMS.,
131,POEMS.,Love Not the World.
132,POEMS.,
133,POEMS.,
134,POEMS.,"Love not the world, trust not its joys; uncertain is their stay;"
135,POEMS.,"Its treasures I've so highly prized, on wings have flown away."
136,POEMS.,"Its riches I would not recall, their loss would not deplore;"
137,POEMS.,Content I'll be if but my Lord salvation's joys restore.
138,POEMS.,
139,POEMS.,"Nature inclines us all to seek, a rich and grand career;"
140,POEMS.,Undue attachment will but make our losses more severe.
141,POEMS.,"Hardly we know how much we love our friends and things below,"
142,POEMS.,Till called to see them one by one from our possession go.
143,POEMS.,
144,POEMS.,"How often then the stricken heart deplores no comfort left,"
145,POEMS.,"Forgetting we have blessings still, of which we're not bereft."
146,POEMS.,"Let houses, lands and splendor go, surroundings all upset,"
147,POEMS.,"If home is where we've friends to love, and friends to love us yet."
148,POEMS.,
149,POEMS.,"With such a home, no matter where, how unadorned the place,"
150,POEMS.,"If but my Lord's, he'll visit there, and with his presence grace."
151,POEMS.,"Thus consecrated to the Lord, his glory will be there."
152,POEMS.,How blest the place where oft is heard the voice of praise and prayer.
153,POEMS.,
154,POEMS.,"Be I but meet for such a place, where angels camp around,"
155,POEMS.,"Where truth and duty are proclaimed, and works of love abound."
156,POEMS.,"The poor and friendless there resort and find their wants supplied,"
157,POEMS.,No lack whose trust is in the Lord; for such he will provide.
158,POEMS.,
159,POEMS.,"There all of every name and race, in need of friendly aid,"
160,POEMS.,Find equal welcome to the board where no distinction's made.
161,POEMS.,"Thus treasures are laid up above, where endless life is given;"
162,POEMS.,"They who are rich in works of love, may hope for rest in Heaven."
163,POEMS.,
164,POEMS.,
165,POEMS.,
166,POEMS.,
167,POEMS.,Preparation for Heaven.
168,POEMS.,
169,POEMS.,
170,POEMS.,"Our every sin must be confessed,"
171,POEMS.,All guile be taken from the breast;
172,POEMS.,"A holy life must we maintain,"
173,POEMS.,If with the Saviour we would reign.
174,POEMS.,
175,POEMS.,"Be trimmed our lamps, our light appear,"
176,POEMS.,Proclaim we Jesus draweth near;
177,POEMS.,"That mercy's closing hour is nigh,"
178,POEMS.,Will be the angel's last loud cry.
179,POEMS.,
180,POEMS.,"Now are we drawing near the port,"
181,POEMS.,"Decisions soon all made in court,"
182,POEMS.,"The scene will close, the Lord will come,--"
183,POEMS.,And who with him will have a home?
184,POEMS.,
185,POEMS.,"To self we must be crucified,"
186,POEMS.,"Be purified, made white and tried,"
187,POEMS.,"Without one spot, and guileless be,"
188,POEMS.,To stand before his Majesty.
189,POEMS.,
190,POEMS.,Oh! be our sleeping powers awake;
191,POEMS.,Eternal bliss is now at stake;
192,POEMS.,"One wrong unrighted, spot or stain,"
193,POEMS.,Will bind in sin's destructive chain.
194,POEMS.,
195,POEMS.,"Haste then, from every error flee;"
196,POEMS.,Strive till you gain the victory.
197,POEMS.,"Triumph in Jesus' name alone,"
198,POEMS.,And sit with him upon his throne.
199,POEMS.,
200,POEMS.,This right with his own blood he bought;
201,POEMS.,"Oh! bliss beyond all human thought,"
202,POEMS.,"Where ransomed throngs the Lord adore,"
203,POEMS.,And sing free grace forevermore.
204,POEMS.,
205,POEMS.,
206,POEMS.,
207,POEMS.,
208,POEMS.,Submission.
209,POEMS.,
210,POEMS.,
211,POEMS.,The Saviour knows our every grief;
212,POEMS.,He knows the time to give relief:
213,POEMS.,"When we are purified and tried,"
214,POEMS.,And our whole wills are sanctified.
215,POEMS.,
216,POEMS.,"How to destroy our dross and tin,"
217,POEMS.,"And cleanse us from each stain of sin,"
218,POEMS.,"What to inflict, the Lord knows best;"
219,POEMS.,'Tis only ours to stand the test.
220,POEMS.,
221,POEMS.,"What though we suffer grief and pain,"
222,POEMS.,"And earth's fair prospects strew the plain,"
223,POEMS.,"Let us submit, whate'er befall,"
224,POEMS.,And make our God our all in all.
225,POEMS.,
226,POEMS.,"What though we're wrongfully accused,"
227,POEMS.,Oft times e'en slanderously abused?
228,POEMS.,"Say not these ills we cannot bear,"
229,POEMS.,But in our Saviour's suffering share.
230,POEMS.,
231,POEMS.,"What he endured no tongue can tell,"
232,POEMS.,When on Him our transgressions fell;
233,POEMS.,"Meekly he bore them on the tree,"
234,POEMS.,And paid the debt for you and me.
235,POEMS.,
236,POEMS.,"He purchased holiness and Heaven,"
237,POEMS.,Or we could ne'er have been forgiven.
238,POEMS.,"The Saviour's blood redemption cost,"
239,POEMS.,Without which all our race was lost.
240,POEMS.,
241,POEMS.,"Shall we then sink beneath the rod,"
242,POEMS.,Inflicted by a holy God
243,POEMS.,"To purify and make us white,"
244,POEMS.,That he may be our sole delight?
245,POEMS.,
246,POEMS.,"No; though it sharply smites, resign,"
247,POEMS.,And pray for grace and love divine;
248,POEMS.,"For all this, Heaven will make amends,"
249,POEMS.,And ofttimes quick deliverance sends.
250,POEMS.,
251,POEMS.,The Lord in him would have us free;
252,POEMS.,"Through Him we gain the victory,"
253,POEMS.,"All he will be to us we need,"
254,POEMS.,That we a holy life may lead.
255,POEMS.,
256,POEMS.,"Be holy. Oh! how blest to know,"
257,POEMS.,Our Father helps to make us so;
258,POEMS.,"'Tis but for us to yield our will,"
259,POEMS.,His word and promise he'll fulfill.
260,POEMS.,
261,POEMS.,"No guilt or fear, no will, no choice;"
262,POEMS.,"In God alone we now rejoice,"
263,POEMS.,"And bless the hand that gave the blow,"
264,POEMS.,And laid our earthly comforts low.
265,POEMS.,
266,POEMS.,
267,POEMS.,
268,POEMS.,
269,POEMS.,It Was True.
270,POEMS.,
271,POEMS.,
272,POEMS.,"I loved th' enchanting viol's sound,"
273,POEMS.,"I loved the sprightly dance,"
274,POEMS.,"And all the dear, delightful scenes"
275,POEMS.,Of nature's wild romance.
276,POEMS.,
277,POEMS.,"I know the fascinating charms,"
278,POEMS.,"In all their depth and hight,"
279,POEMS.,Presumed on days and months and years
280,POEMS.,Of exquisite delight.
281,POEMS.,
282,POEMS.,"Though seventy-six, I feel I still"
283,POEMS.,These halls of mirth could grace;
284,POEMS.,I left them when in youth[1] and sought
285,POEMS.,In Christ a hiding place.
286,POEMS.,
287,POEMS.,But oh! the bitter cup I drank
288,POEMS.,That tamed my wild career;
289,POEMS.,Death struck my parents from my side
290,POEMS.,And drowned my joy in tears.
291,POEMS.,
292,POEMS.,"My dear loved home of childhood's years,"
293,POEMS.,"Where all was life and glee,"
294,POEMS.,"Became a house of mourning, and"
295,POEMS.,Ere long no home for me.
296,POEMS.,
297,POEMS.,"I've since formed nearer, dearer ties,"
298,POEMS.,"And they too, have been riven."
299,POEMS.,By these repeated strokes I've learned
300,POEMS.,There's nothing true but Heaven.
301,POEMS.,
302,POEMS.,"My treasure's there, my heart is there,"
303,POEMS.,The prize I mean to win;
304,POEMS.,But know the victory must be gained
305,POEMS.,O'er every darling sin.
306,POEMS.,
307,POEMS.,And may refiner's fire go through
308,POEMS.,Till I am purified;
309,POEMS.,"Till patience is perfected here,"
310,POEMS.,And all my graces tried.
311,POEMS.,
312,POEMS.,"I'd bear the fiery trial now,"
313,POEMS.,"Till holy made and pure,"
314,POEMS.,"That I Christ's image may reflect,"
315,POEMS.,And be in him secure.
316,POEMS.,
317,POEMS.,"A home in Heaven will then be mine,"
318,POEMS.,A house not made with hands;
319,POEMS.,"Where Jesus will his saints receive,"
320,POEMS.,Who walk in his commands.
321,POEMS.,
322,POEMS.,"Be it mine to walk the narrow way,"
323,POEMS.,"Which my Redeemer trod,"
324,POEMS.,And in the City have a place
325,POEMS.,Close by the throne of God.
326,POEMS.,
327,POEMS.,"There friends will meet to part no more,"
328,POEMS.,Whose sins are here forgiven.
329,POEMS.,"I would not rest until I know,"
330,POEMS.,I have a home in Heaven.
331,POEMS.,
332,POEMS.,
333,POEMS.,[1]At eighteen.
334,POEMS.,
335,POEMS.,
336,POEMS.,
337,POEMS.,
338,POEMS.,No Resting Here.
339,POEMS.,
340,POEMS.,
341,POEMS.,"No resting place! oh! sad, oppressive thought!"
342,POEMS.,"The overburdened heart opprest with grief,"
343,POEMS.,"Must bear its weight o'er sad reflection's tide,"
344,POEMS.,Fearing at last the fate of unbelief.
345,POEMS.,
346,POEMS.,"Is there one here, without one beam of hope?"
347,POEMS.,"Oppressed, desponding, bordering on despair?"
348,POEMS.,"Still sinking 'neath gloom's dark and heavy cloud,"
349,POEMS.,Not thinking e'er one cheering boon to share?
350,POEMS.,
351,POEMS.,"Lie still, e'en here, and search the hidden cause;"
352,POEMS.,O'er every sin has victory been won?
353,POEMS.,"Then trust in God o'er this dark, dreary way,"
354,POEMS.,"And say, Dear Lord, thy will, not mine, be done."
355,POEMS.,
356,POEMS.,"The broken heart, the humble, contrite one,"
357,POEMS.,"God will relieve from sin's dark, heavy load;"
358,POEMS.,"He will reveal himself a present help,"
359,POEMS.,And make for us a sure and safe abode.
360,POEMS.,
361,POEMS.,"For such as these a resting place remains,"
362,POEMS.,When earth's dark scenes and trials all are o'er;
363,POEMS.,A home in Heaven where saints and angels are
364,POEMS.,Chanting glad songs of glory evermore.
365,POEMS.,
366,POEMS.,
367,POEMS.,
368,POEMS.,
369,POEMS.,Deny Thyself.
370,POEMS.,
371,POEMS.,
372,POEMS.,"The word we preach is nigh thee,"
373,POEMS.,"Is in thy mouth and heart,"
374,POEMS.,"To cease from every evil,"
375,POEMS.,From every idol part.
376,POEMS.,
377,POEMS.,"The last decree, how solemn,"
378,POEMS.,"Except we conquer now,"
379,POEMS.,"No remedy can reach us,"
380,POEMS.,Nor pay our broken vow.
381,POEMS.,
382,POEMS.,"While faithless, unrepentant,"
383,POEMS.,"We cannot be forgiven,"
384,POEMS.,"No mercy will be offered,"
385,POEMS.,No home for us in Heaven.
386,POEMS.,
387,POEMS.,"As well give up to perish,"
388,POEMS.,If we cannot deny
389,POEMS.,"Our appetites and passions,"
390,POEMS.,While Heavenly aid is nigh.
391,POEMS.,
392,POEMS.,Soon there will be no promise
393,POEMS.,"Of pardoning grace, now free."
394,POEMS.,"Ere Jesus ceases pleading,"
395,POEMS.,We must get victory.
396,POEMS.,
397,POEMS.,Soon with no mediator
398,POEMS.,"To help our ruined case,"
399,POEMS.,"The filthy must be filthy,"
400,POEMS.,Beyond the reach of grace.
401,POEMS.,
402,POEMS.,
403,POEMS.,
404,POEMS.,
405,POEMS.,Baptism.
406,POEMS.,
407,POEMS.,
408,POEMS.,"We fail not, when watching, our duty to know,"
409,POEMS.,While Jesus makes out all our pathway below.
410,POEMS.,"When he bids be buried with him 'neath the wave,"
411,POEMS.,Let nought keep us back from the watery grave.
412,POEMS.,
413,POEMS.,"Go forward; these waters are ever the place,"
414,POEMS.,Where Jesus is found with his presence to grace;
415,POEMS.,"While angels make each of its subjects their care,"
416,POEMS.,And the Spirit of God sheds its blessedness there.
417,POEMS.,
418,POEMS.,"Oh, blest institution! the Lord owns it still,"
419,POEMS.,And moves on his people his word to fulfill;
420,POEMS.,"In newness of life will he help to arise,"
421,POEMS.,While they humbly press on toward the mark for the prize.
422,POEMS.,
423,POEMS.,How heavenly the sight of an ordinance like this;
424,POEMS.,"The pledge, it would seem, of perpetual bliss:"
425,POEMS.,"God honored below, while his people rejoice,"
426,POEMS.,"Making known to the world, they obey him from choice."
427,POEMS.,
428,POEMS.,"We'll follow the footsteps of Jesus, our King,"
429,POEMS.,Till we the glad songs of deliverance sing.
430,POEMS.,"We'll exalt him while here, we will love and adore,"
431,POEMS.,And with the redeemed sound his praise evermore.
432,POEMS.,
433,POEMS.,
434,POEMS.,
435,POEMS.,
436,POEMS.,Despair of the Lost.
437,POEMS.,
438,POEMS.,
439,POEMS.,Of our strength we are shorn by indulgence in sin;
440,POEMS.,"Where Jesus has reigned, now there's no room within;"
441,POEMS.,A host of his murderers dwell in the heart;
442,POEMS.,"Rejected, though grieved, he's obliged to depart."
443,POEMS.,
444,POEMS.,As he goes who can know he will ever return?
445,POEMS.,"That the blessing is lost we may soon have to learn,"
446,POEMS.,"With a wail of despair, a lamentable cry,"
447,POEMS.,We may soon see ourselves forever passed by.
448,POEMS.,
449,POEMS.,"Too late! oh, too late! now my soul must be lost;"
450,POEMS.,Though redemption was offered at infinite cost;
451,POEMS.,Though help has been laid on one mighty to save;
452,POEMS.,To self and the world I the preference gave.
453,POEMS.,
454,POEMS.,"Could the hope of salvation be given once more,"
455,POEMS.,"Would we not turn our backs on our Lord, as before?"
456,POEMS.,Would not the same spirit still bear the same fruit?
457,POEMS.,And the Lord still to us our transgressions impute?
458,POEMS.,
459,POEMS.,"Oh! poor fallen man, rushing on to despair,"
460,POEMS.,"With high hopes all anchored in earth's fatal snare,"
461,POEMS.,"To be swept away soon, with the refuge of lies,"
462,POEMS.,While the soul in deep anguish the second death dies.
463,POEMS.,
464,POEMS.,
465,POEMS.,
466,POEMS.,
467,POEMS.,Depart from Sin.
468,POEMS.,
469,POEMS.,
470,POEMS.,Could the deluded votaries
471,POEMS.,"Of fashion and of song,"
472,POEMS.,"But see their danger, they would cry,"
473,POEMS.,We've ventured here too long.
474,POEMS.,
475,POEMS.,"Yes, ventured o'er a precipice,"
476,POEMS.,"Held by a brittle thread,"
477,POEMS.,"While ""fiery billows roll beneath"""
478,POEMS.,The slippery paths we tread.
479,POEMS.,
480,POEMS.,"We've ventured to reject the call,"
481,POEMS.,"In love and pity given,"
482,POEMS.,"To flee sin's awful destiny,"
483,POEMS.,And seek a home in Heaven.
484,POEMS.,
485,POEMS.,"Could tears prevail, could pity move,"
486,POEMS.,"You would not longer stand,"
487,POEMS.,Exposed by every dashing wave
488,POEMS.,In yon broad gulf to land.
489,POEMS.,
490,POEMS.,"But tears and pity cannot save,"
491,POEMS.,"Nor for one sin atone,"
492,POEMS.,Redemption's purchased with the blood
493,POEMS.,Of Jesus Christ alone.
494,POEMS.,
495,POEMS.,"The debt is paid; salvation's free,"
496,POEMS.,"Though Jesus' life it cost,"
497,POEMS.,And all who come to him he'll save;
498,POEMS.,Then why should you be lost?
499,POEMS.,
500,POEMS.,Oh! be entreated to forsake
501,POEMS.,"The road that leads to hell,"
502,POEMS.,And thus be fitted for the place
503,POEMS.,Where saints and angels dwell.
504,POEMS.,
505,POEMS.,
506,POEMS.,
507,POEMS.,
508,POEMS.,"Old, but Young."
509,POEMS.,
510,POEMS.,
511,POEMS.,Infirmities of age have not
512,POEMS.,As yet made me their prey;
513,POEMS.,In social life I sometimes feel
514,POEMS.,As one still young and gay.
515,POEMS.,
516,POEMS.,"My spirits buoyant, hopeful, free,"
517,POEMS.,"No cloud to intervene,"
518,POEMS.,"Till I'm a wonder to myself,"
519,POEMS.,And ask what this can mean.
520,POEMS.,
521,POEMS.,"Is there a dark and heavy cloud,"
522,POEMS.,"Now gathering out of sight,"
523,POEMS.,"To come o'er this my cheerful path,"
524,POEMS.,And turn it into night?
525,POEMS.,
526,POEMS.,"Well, be it so; I'll now enjoy"
527,POEMS.,"Life's blessings while I may,"
528,POEMS.,"And meet its changes as they come,"
529,POEMS.,The footsteps of decay.
530,POEMS.,
531,POEMS.,At seventy-six we might expect
532,POEMS.,"Our life-lights to grow dim,"
533,POEMS.,"The slow-paced step and wasted form,"
534,POEMS.,Though once erect and trim.
535,POEMS.,
536,POEMS.,'Tis nature's course; time's withering blight
537,POEMS.,Will come on all below.
538,POEMS.,Be ready then for any change
539,POEMS.,Time bids us undergo.
540,POEMS.,
541,POEMS.,Then when this earth is made anew
542,POEMS.,"All clothed in living green,"
543,POEMS.,"Where blight, decay, and care-worn brows"
544,POEMS.,"Are never to be seen,"
545,POEMS.,
546,POEMS.,"We all shall bloom immortal, fair,"
547,POEMS.,"In Eden beauty dressed,"
548,POEMS.,"To share all Heaven's eternal joys,"
549,POEMS.,And be forever blessed.
550,POEMS.,
551,POEMS.,
552,POEMS.,
553,POEMS.,
554,POEMS.,Passing the Gate.
555,POEMS.,
556,POEMS.,Lines on leaving the house of a dear friend where I had
557,POEMS.,pleasantly spent several weeks.
558,POEMS.,
559,POEMS.,
560,POEMS.,"Down deep in the heart is a fountain of tears,"
561,POEMS.,Though seldom it flows to the eye;
562,POEMS.,"'Tis not that I have not true interest and love,"
563,POEMS.,"That I say not the sad words, Good bye."
564,POEMS.,
565,POEMS.,"The gate must be opened, and opened for me,"
566,POEMS.,"For me to go out of the place,"
567,POEMS.,"Where I have enjoyed the best bounties of earth,"
568,POEMS.,Where in love face has answered to face.
569,POEMS.,
570,POEMS.,"As I passed through the gate, language fails to express"
571,POEMS.,My deep-felt emotions of heart;
572,POEMS.,'Twas leaving a home where was freedom and rest;
573,POEMS.,And who else can such favors impart?
574,POEMS.,
575,POEMS.,Not that I was homeless; another dear place
576,POEMS.,"Was all ready and waiting me, where"
577,POEMS.,Again I should mingle with children and friends;
578,POEMS.,But oh! there's life's burden and care.
579,POEMS.,
580,POEMS.,"'Tis not that I'd shun them, and useless remain,"
581,POEMS.,That I felt thus while passing the gate;
582,POEMS.,"But feelings which beckon to higher results,"
583,POEMS.,Thoughts I may not attempt to relate.
584,POEMS.,
585,POEMS.,"When fortune's wheel turns, will the gate opened be,"
586,POEMS.,Be opened for me to come through?
587,POEMS.,"Shall I find the same friends and the dear quiet room,"
588,POEMS.,And my former engagements pursue?
589,POEMS.,
590,POEMS.,"To Him who controls all the myriad worlds,"
591,POEMS.,With Him would I leave each event;
592,POEMS.,"I would move in his order, and walk in his light,"
593,POEMS.,And know that my time is well spent.
594,POEMS.,
595,POEMS.,"Then whether I ever that gate pass, or not,"
596,POEMS.,"Those loved ones again ever see,"
597,POEMS.,The gates of the City will open for all
598,POEMS.,Who its glories and beauties would see.
599,POEMS.,
600,POEMS.,
601,POEMS.,
602,POEMS.,
603,POEMS.,Trust all to God.
604,POEMS.,
605,POEMS.,
606,POEMS.,"We wait on God, our strength renewed,"
607,POEMS.,"Our love of self and pride subdued,"
608,POEMS.,"We then can cruel slander bear,"
609,POEMS.,Nor ask why we these sufferings share.
610,POEMS.,
611,POEMS.,"We may exalted be by men,"
612,POEMS.,Be censured and condemned; what then?
613,POEMS.,"Our worth is in the Lord alone,"
614,POEMS.,To whom our thoughts and acts are known.
615,POEMS.,
616,POEMS.,"That I am God, know and be still,"
617,POEMS.,Though wrongfully you're suffering ill.
618,POEMS.,How many sins committed where
619,POEMS.,"No eye has seen, yet still I spare."
620,POEMS.,
621,POEMS.,"Be humble, meek, and low of heart,"
622,POEMS.,Nor from my holy law depart.
623,POEMS.,"Thus will your strength be oft renewed,"
624,POEMS.,And you with holy zeal imbued.
625,POEMS.,
626,POEMS.,"In that dread day you then can stand,"
627,POEMS.,"Where rocks are rent, and solid land"
628,POEMS.,"And mountains shake, and cities fall;"
629,POEMS.,"I'll be your strength, your God, your all."
630,POEMS.,
631,POEMS.,"From earth's dread ruins you'll be caught,"
632,POEMS.,"To God's celestial city brought,"
633,POEMS.,"Robed in a pure and spotless dress,"
634,POEMS.,The robe of Christ's own righteousness.
635,POEMS.,
636,POEMS.,Then every stain will be erased
637,POEMS.,From reputations now defaced;
638,POEMS.,"And where was anguish, grief and tears,"
639,POEMS.,Now smiles and bliss and joy appears.
640,POEMS.,
641,POEMS.,"To be forever with the Lord,"
642,POEMS.,"To share the infinite reward,"
643,POEMS.,"To sit with him upon his throne,"
644,POEMS.,To see and know as we are known.
645,POEMS.,
646,POEMS.,"In everlasting songs divine,"
647,POEMS.,In sweetest union all will join.
648,POEMS.,"Who can describe the bliss there'll be,"
649,POEMS.,When blessed with immortality?
650,POEMS.,
651,POEMS.,
652,POEMS.,
653,POEMS.,
654,POEMS.,The Vanity of Earth.
655,POEMS.,
656,POEMS.,
657,POEMS.,"Sickness prostrates; helpless sufferer,"
658,POEMS.,Who can stem the sorrowing tide?
659,POEMS.,"Oh! how vain, when death approacheth,"
660,POEMS.,"Earthly pleasures, wealth and pride."
661,POEMS.,
662,POEMS.,"Though your name may be illustrious,"
663,POEMS.,"Handed down through ages yet,"
664,POEMS.,"Worldly honor and distinction,"
665,POEMS.,We shall all ere long forget.
666,POEMS.,
667,POEMS.,"Weeping friends may stand around you,"
668,POEMS.,Flattering prospects urge your stay;
669,POEMS.,"But compelled by the destroyer,"
670,POEMS.,To be launched from earth away.
671,POEMS.,
672,POEMS.,"Past reflections, oh! how painful,"
673,POEMS.,If not answered life's great end;
674,POEMS.,"Time all spent in vain delusion,"
675,POEMS.,"Now no hope, no God, no friend."
676,POEMS.,
677,POEMS.,"Who can paint the bitter anguish,"
678,POEMS.,Felt at such a time as this;
679,POEMS.,"Soon to leave those cherished idols,"
680,POEMS.,Purchased with unending bliss.
681,POEMS.,
682,POEMS.,"Though we gain the world, what profit,"
683,POEMS.,If we lose our souls at last?
684,POEMS.,"Buy the gold, the shining raiment,"
685,POEMS.,Ere the day of grace is past.
686,POEMS.,
687,POEMS.,
688,POEMS.,
689,POEMS.,
690,POEMS.,Dying Words.
691,POEMS.,
692,POEMS.,
693,POEMS.,There was one who to me was most lovely and dear;
694,POEMS.,"I looked, and that loved one I saw disappear;"
695,POEMS.,"My dear, only daughter, who in life's early years,"
696,POEMS.,"Has gone to the grave, and has left me in tears."
697,POEMS.,
698,POEMS.,"The words of her parting, were, Jesus is mine;"
699,POEMS.,"He'll save, and I shall in his own likeness shine."
700,POEMS.,To God be all glory; Heaven's opened to me;
701,POEMS.,"I shall rise with the saints, and immortal shall be."
702,POEMS.,
703,POEMS.,"My brothers, be wise and obey Heaven's laws;"
704,POEMS.,Seek the Saviour to please and to honor his cause;
705,POEMS.,"Rest not till you know all your sins are forgiven,"
706,POEMS.,"Oh! fail not, my brothers, to meet me in Heaven."
707,POEMS.,
708,POEMS.,"My mother, be ready to meet me that day,"
709,POEMS.,Nor mourn that here with you no longer I stay.
710,POEMS.,Prepare for the trouble that soon is to come--
711,POEMS.,Who then will enjoy his own loved quiet home?
712,POEMS.,
713,POEMS.,"I die in the Lord, from my labors to rest"
714,POEMS.,"With the dead, of whom it is said, ""They are blest."""
715,POEMS.,"For me bid farewell to the loved and the true,"
716,POEMS.,May we meet where is heard no mournful adieu.
717,POEMS.,
718,POEMS.,"My mother, I'm dying, but Jesus is here;"
719,POEMS.,With him I have nothing of evil to fear.
720,POEMS.,"Thus peaceful she died, but still lingered the trace"
721,POEMS.,Of the image divine on her cold pallid face.
722,POEMS.,
723,POEMS.,"In the lone, quiet tomb where she's longed to repose,"
724,POEMS.,"She rests from life's cares, from its ""burden of woes,"""

738,POEMS.,
739,POEMS.,"They say, ""I'd give a thousand worlds"

741,POEMS.,"Your cause is just, to conquer here,"
742,POEMS.,And all your rights maintain.
743,POEMS.,
744,POEMS.,"""What use,"" you ask, ""to say I will,"

747,POEMS.,"To quit, but oh! I can't."""
748,POEMS.,
749,POEMS.,"Well, be it so; your course pursue,"
750,POEMS.,But what will be the end?
751,POEMS.,"Your conscience soon will be so seared,"
752,POEMS.,You'll want no other friend.
753,POEMS.,
754,POEMS.,"Chief of the comforts you enjoy,"
755,POEMS.,What comfort now you take.
756,POEMS.,"When you're deprived of these, how sad,"
757,POEMS.,Gloomy and desolate.
758,POEMS.,
759,POEMS.,Why thus? Your nerves are all unstrung;
760,POEMS.,You're almost ruined now.
761,POEMS.,"Does patience have her perfect work,"
762,POEMS.,While thus you break each vow?
763,POEMS.,
764,POEMS.,"When worn with toil, how soon you seek"
765,POEMS.,"Your coffee, rum, or tea;"

768,POEMS.,
769,POEMS.,"Another, all his senses gone,"

771,POEMS.,"In irritation mourns his lot,"
772,POEMS.,From him all good seems hid.
773,POEMS.,
774,POEMS.,"The poisonous weed, the deadly drink"

776,POEMS.,"So are they loved, men hardly wish"
777,POEMS.,Their appetites subdued.
778,POEMS.,
779,POEMS.,The exhilarating influence
780,POEMS.,"When loved, who will forego?"
781,POEMS.,The sad effects of these produce
782,POEMS.,The sum of human woe.
783,POEMS.,
784,POEMS.,Not we alone the sufferers are;
785,POEMS.,Our friends must bear a part;
786,POEMS.,The animation felt by us
787,POEMS.,With them is a broken heart.
788,POEMS.,
789,POEMS.,"An oft untimely grave the lot,"
790,POEMS.,Of those thus overcome;
791,POEMS.,"What desolation then is felt,"
792,POEMS.,In their once peaceful home?
793,POEMS.,
794,POEMS.,"Ere vigor, health, and life are gone,"
795,POEMS.,Rouse every latent power;
796,POEMS.,"The victory gained, again you're blest,"
797,POEMS.,Within your own loved bower.
798,POEMS.,
799,POEMS.,"Heed not the tempter when he comes,"
800,POEMS.,And pleads once more to yield;
801,POEMS.,"Have you not fully yet resolved,"
802,POEMS.,To shun this battle-field?
803,POEMS.,
804,POEMS.,Why risk the victory you have gained?
805,POEMS.,Your resolution lost
806,POEMS.,"This once might prove your ruin here,"
807,POEMS.,And life eternal cost.
808,POEMS.,
809,POEMS.,"Try once again, while there is hope"
810,POEMS.,To conquer and to live;
811,POEMS.,"God will, if you will let him, help,"
812,POEMS.,And all the past forgive.
813,POEMS.,
814,POEMS.,He'll help to get the victory;
815,POEMS.,"And victory must be gained,"
816,POEMS.,"Or no resolve to break the hold,"
817,POEMS.,Will ever be maintained.
818,POEMS.,
819,POEMS.,"Not victory for a single day,"
820,POEMS.,"A week, a month, a year;"
821,POEMS.,But victory that will stand the test
822,POEMS.,While we continue here.
823,POEMS.,
824,POEMS.,A victory that will overcome
825,POEMS.,"Inordinate desire,"
826,POEMS.,"To gratify perverted taste,"

828,POEMS.,
829,POEMS.,The conflict rages fiercely on;
830,POEMS.,"Here victory, then defeat;"

834,POEMS.,"An armor for us is prepared,"

852,POEMS.,
853,POEMS.,
854,POEMS.,Are we assured our home's in Heaven?
855,POEMS.,That all our sins are now forgiven?

857,POEMS.,And God's approving smile receive?
858,POEMS.,
859,POEMS.,Is every weight now laid aside?
860,POEMS.,The last besetting sin denied?
861,POEMS.,God then to us this knowledge gives:
862,POEMS.,"""I know that my Redeemer lives."""
863,POEMS.,
864,POEMS.,"This consciousness must purify,"
865,POEMS.,And bring eternal glories nigh.
866,POEMS.,"Though here we bear affliction's rod,"

868,POEMS.,
869,POEMS.,"No suffering there; ""all trials cease,"

894,POEMS.,
895,POEMS.,"Pleased with your demeanor, and turn of your mind,"
896,POEMS.,With attractions I seem to see in thee combined;

899,POEMS.,
900,POEMS.,"Though past man's alloted threescore and ten years,"
901,POEMS.,"Though I've passed through afflictions, in sorrow and tears,"

919,POEMS.,"Whose musical talents none can but admire,"
920,POEMS.,"Who is loved and looked up to as teacher and guide,"
921,POEMS.,"To leave for the war, will be felt far and wide."
922,POEMS.,
923,POEMS.,"But it is not, dear nephew, for earth's vain delight,"
924,POEMS.,That you leave home and friends for your country to fight;
925,POEMS.,It is for the Union--our rights to maintain--
926,POEMS.,That you go where the strife piles its thousands of slain.

949,POEMS.,I'm happy in thinking you'll bring home a wife
950,POEMS.,"To take the direction in things of this life,"
951,POEMS.,"May her interest and aim be all one with us here,"
952,POEMS.,And she be to mother a daughter most dear.
953,POEMS.,
954,POEMS.,"The sister, the daughter, and wife, all combine;"

973,POEMS.,
974,POEMS.,"Should I be a burden still greater to bear,"
975,POEMS.,The daughter and wife in the trial must share.
976,POEMS.,"Think then of my age, over seventy years,"
977,POEMS.,And bear with me though I cause sorrow and tears.
978,POEMS.,
979,POEMS.,"Though fretful, impatient, not suited at all,"
980,POEMS.,"And you think it best not to mind every call,"
981,POEMS.,"Remember past seasons, my kindness, and know"
982,POEMS.,I would have you as blest as one could be below.
983,POEMS.,
984,POEMS.,"And in the new earth when all trials are o'er,"

3395,A BRIEF SKETCH,A BRIEF SKETCH
3396,OF THE,OF THE
3397,OF THE,"_Life, Last Sickness and Death_"
3398,OF,OF
3399,ANNIE R. SMITH.,ANNIE R. SMITH.
3400,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3401,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3402,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Annie Rebekah Smith, only daughter of Samuel and Rebekah Smith, was born"
3403,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"in West Wilton, N. H., March 16, 1828. When ten years of age, she was"
3404,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"converted and joined the Baptist church, in which connection she remained"
3405,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"till 1844, when she embraced the doctrine of the soon coming of Christ,"
3406,ANNIE R. SMITH.,and withdrew from the church that she might more freely engage in the
3407,ANNIE R. SMITH.,work of preparation for that event. After the passing of the time in
3408,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"1844, being thrown with others into doubt respecting our position in the"
3409,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"prophetic calendar, she pursued her favorite occupations of studying and"
3410,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"teaching. Commencing in 1844, as assistant in a select school kept by"
3411,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Miss Sarah Livermore, in Wilton, between that time and 1850 she taught,"
3412,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"in different places, seven district schools, attending, meanwhile, a term"
3413,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"each in Milford, Hancock and New Ipswich, N. H., and six terms at the"
3414,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Ladies' Female Seminary in Charlestown, Mass. At the latter place she"
3415,ANNIE R. SMITH.,fitted herself for a teacher in Oil Painting and French.
3416,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3417,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"In 1850 she took a sketch of Boston and Charlestown from Prospect Hill,"
3418,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Somerville, three miles distant. The effort was too much for her eyes,"
3419,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"and, for about eight months she almost entirely lost the use of them. On"
3420,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"account of this difficulty, she was obliged to decline a proposition to"
3421,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"teach in the seminary at Hancock, which made her misfortune seem almost"
3422,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"intolerable, so great was her disappointment. The only alleviation which"
3423,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"she found for her affliction in this time, was in becoming an agent for,"
3424,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"and contributor to, ""The Ladies' Wreath,"" a monthly magazine published in"
3425,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"New York. Her contributions to this periodical, with the exception of a"
3426,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"few pieces published in the ""Odd Fellow,"" and some other papers, were her"
3427,ANNIE R. SMITH.,first efforts at public writing.
3428,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3429,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Her friends in Charlestown, thinking the salt water would prove a benefit"
3430,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"to her eyes, invited her to spend a season with them. She went in 1851,"
3431,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"not expecting to be gone many weeks, but did not return till November,"
3432,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"1852, when she was called home by the sickness and death of her father."
3433,ANNIE R. SMITH.,During her stay in Boston and vicinity she went to Portland and Nova
3434,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Scotia. I requested her to go once, to please me, to sister Temple's, in"
3435,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Boston, to a Seventh-day Adventist meeting. Some remarkable incidents in"
3436,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"connection with her attendance at this meeting, together with the"
3437,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"faithful efforts of the friends of the truth, arrested her attention; and"
3438,ANNIE R. SMITH.,in about three weeks she committed herself upon the Sabbath and its
3439,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"attendant truths. The next week she sent to the ""Advent Review"" the piece"
3440,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"of poetry entitled ""Fear not, Little Flock,"" which was her first"
3441,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"contribution to that paper. The ""Review"" was then published in Saratoga,"
3442,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"N. Y., and she was immediately requested to take a position in that"
3443,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"office. She replied that she could not, on account of the trouble with"
3444,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"her eyes, but was told to come as she was, or to that effect. Arriving"
3445,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"there, the directions in James 5:14, 15, were followed, and her eyes were"
3446,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"so far strengthened in answer to prayer, that she was soon enabled to"
3447,ANNIE R. SMITH.,engage without restraint in the work of the office.
3448,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3449,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"With strong faith and fervent zeal, she entered heartily into the work."
3450,ANNIE R. SMITH.,She rejoiced in the new-found truth. The whole current of her mind was
3451,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"changed, and nobler aspirations took possession of her heart. From a"
3452,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"position of exaltation and honor among men, she had now turned her eyes"
3453,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, reserved in Heaven for the"
3454,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"followers of Christ, and to a place at last with the redeemed before the"
3455,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"throne. Her contributions to the ""Review"" while it was published in"
3456,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Saratoga and Rochester, N. Y., afterwards published in her volume of"
3457,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"poems, entitled, ""Home here, and Home in Heaven,"" show the themes upon"
3458,ANNIE R. SMITH.,which her mind delighted to dwell.
3459,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3460,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"In November, 1852, as already stated, she was called home by the sickness"
3461,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"of her father, who died the first of December following. In January,"
3462,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"1853, before returning to N. Y., she was solicited, in connection with"
3463,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"her brother Uriah, to take charge of the Academy in Mont Vernon, N. H.,"
3464,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"with a salary for the first year, of one thousand dollars, and a prospect"
3465,ANNIE R. SMITH.,of increase as they should bring the school up to a greater degree of
3466,ANNIE R. SMITH.,prosperity. But she preferred to labor in some capacity where her efforts
3467,ANNIE R. SMITH.,would tend more directly to spread a knowledge of the truth among the
3468,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"people, and lead them to seek salvation through Christ the Saviour of"
3469,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"men. She therefore declined the offer, preferring, without any pecuniary"
3470,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"consideration, to again connect herself with the office."
3471,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3472,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Two years later, in November, 1854, she came home to West Wilton,"
3473,ANNIE R. SMITH.,suffering under the first stages of that disease which shortly brought
3474,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"her to the grave. The following from a letter to a friend, written soon"
3475,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"after her death, sets forth the occasion of her last sickness, and the"
3476,ANNIE R. SMITH.,circumstances attending the closing hours of her life:
3477,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3478,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"On account of sickness in the family where she boarded, she assisted in"
3479,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"the kitchen awhile, where was a warm stove, and in consequence of a"
3480,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"letter being left, she hastened with it to the office unprepared for a"
3481,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"cold, wet morning. Had she returned immediately, as she should have done,"
3482,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"all might have been well. But she stayed through the day, as her work was"
3483,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"there, and became very cold and chilly. That cold undoubtedly seated"
3484,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"itself immediately upon her lungs, and threw her into night sweats and a"
3485,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"hard cough, which ended but with her life."
3486,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3487,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"So rapid was the wasting process of her disease, that within six weeks"
3488,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"from the time she took the cold, she rode up in the cars, on her way"
3489,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"home, with an intimate acquaintance of hers who did not know her. He told"
3490,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"me he thought of her, but thought it could not be Annie, she was so"
3491,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"altered in her looks, being so poor and pale. Her brother Samuel said he"
3492,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"did not think he should have known her had he met her unexpectedly, and"
3493,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"said with a most dejected look, ""_I don't think she will live._"""
3494,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3495,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"She came home the 7th of November, kept about and worked some till about"
3496,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"the 1st of December, when she had a very distressed day, and raised"
3497,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"blood. Having confidence in water treatment, she went where she could"
3498,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"receive such treatment, to see the effect it would have, and to get"
3499,ANNIE R. SMITH.,information. She continued this course till the following February. She
3500,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"felt better while under the exhilarating effect of the water, but became"
3501,ANNIE R. SMITH.,satisfied that she was no better.
3502,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3503,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"The 14th of February, most providentially, Bro. Joseph Bates called on"
3504,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"us, and stopped till the 18th. This was the occasion of a great blessing"
3505,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"to her. At the commencement of the Sabbath, the 16th, the spirit and"
3506,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"power of God descended upon her, and she praised God with a loud voice. I"
3507,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"felt at the same time the sweet influence of Heaven, and the presence of"
3508,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"holy angels. I believed God was hearing prayer, and granting his"
3509,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"blessing, and joined them in praising and giving glory to his name. Bro."
3510,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"B. then said to Annie, ""You needed this blessing, and now if the Lord"
3511,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"sees that it is best for you to be laid away in the grave, he will go"
3512,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"with you."""
3513,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3514,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"She appeared some stronger and better a few days in the day time, but I"
3515,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"could not see that she rested, or was much different nights. Her cough"
3516,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"remained obstinate, and I do not think the disease was ever stayed. She"
3517,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"was greatly strengthened in a spiritual point of view, and engaged more"
3518,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"earnestly in exhorting people to believe the Word, and be ready for the"
3519,ANNIE R. SMITH.,coming of the Lord. She would feel impressed to go out and talk with
3520,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"different individuals upon the truth, and was strengthened and blessed in"
3521,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"so doing. Victory was generally gained, so that the truth was verified,"
3522,ANNIE R. SMITH.,that whom the Lord makes free is free indeed. We had from that time as
3523,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"long as she lived, some of the most sweet, melting seasons of prayer that"
3524,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"I ever enjoyed, often accompanied with shouts of praise to the Lord."
3525,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3526,ANNIE R. SMITH.,It was evident to all around that Annie was failing. Her symptoms became
3527,ANNIE R. SMITH.,alarming. The 20th of March her brother Samuel was taken suddenly and
3528,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"very sick with influenza and fever, three miles and a half away at his"
3529,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"boarding place, and unable to get home. Annie said I must go and attend"
3530,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"upon him, even if she never saw me again."
3531,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3532,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"The 30th she went to Mason Village to stay with sister Gorham, while I"
3533,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"was with her brother. While there, word came that Annie was much worse."
3534,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"The 12th of April I went to Mason Village, and found her very much worse"
3535,ANNIE R. SMITH.,than I expected. For twelve days her death was almost hourly expected by
3536,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"those around. She said to me, ""Mother, that poem I've been writing since"
3537,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"January, 1855, [since published under the title of ""Home Here and Home in"
3538,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Heaven,""] I suppose must all be lost. It is unconnected, and nothing can"
3539,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"be done with it to advantage, without me."" I went to Wilton and got the"
3540,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"papers containing what she had written, but she was not able to do"
3541,ANNIE R. SMITH.,anything with them. She then prayed that she might be enabled to finish
3542,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"the poem, and prepare the book she had in contemplation; that if she did"
3543,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"not live, it might be that through it, she being dead would yet speak,"
3544,ANNIE R. SMITH.,and that good might be done.
3545,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3546,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Sabbath April 21, the meeting was at sister Gorham's. We did not hold it"
3547,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"in her room on account of her low state of health, but went in to close"
3548,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"the exercises, when to our surprise she commenced praying with more than"
3549,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"usual strength. The presence of God was manifested, and his power rested"
3550,ANNIE R. SMITH.,down upon her in a remarkable manner. She said she was raised up to go
3551,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"home, and to do the will of the Lord. She rested better that night than"
3552,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"she had for a long while. The next day she rode to Wilton, seven miles,"
3553,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"to the astonishment of all. Many from our village had been to see her,"
3554,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"and taken their leave, never expecting to see her again; and when they"
3555,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"saw the carriage drive up, they came in to inquire when she died. Great"
3556,ANNIE R. SMITH.,was their surprise to find her able to walk about the room. She was again
3557,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"in her own quiet home, and soon commenced on her work. She was not able"
3558,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"to write much herself, and I kept paper and pencil to write what she"
3559,ANNIE R. SMITH.,dictated at her will.
3560,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3561,ANNIE R. SMITH.,The 28th of May she had arranged and composed the last verse of her poem
3562,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"""Home Here and Home in Heaven."" The 29th, her brother Uriah came home"
3563,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"just in time to write it off for the press, and to assist her in"
3564,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"arranging her other poetry for reprinting. She, however, made some"
3565,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"alterations, and some little additions while he was copying it."
3566,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3567,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"She dreamed in February that she was with a people, seemingly spectators,"
3568,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"and before her was the most beautiful road, which glistened like gold."
3569,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"There was a company arranged by the side, and some one came to her with a"
3570,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"peony, and said to her, ""You must go over upon that road and hold up this"
3571,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"peony."" She stood there dressed in white, holding up the peony, when she"
3572,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"awoke with the most pleasing impression, that she had yet something more"
3573,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"to do for the Lord. She fully believed after she came from Mason, that"
3574,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"she should accomplish the work she had in view, and that this was what"
3575,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"was represented by her dream. The peony was her favorite flower, and as"
3576,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"soon as they were in blossom, Uriah sketched and engraved one for the"
3577,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"book, as is seen on the title page."
3578,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3579,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"She often said in view of her dream, that when the book was done there"
3580,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"would be a change in her. She should either be raised up to live, or she"
3581,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"should die. Her prayer was answered. The book was all done on her part,"
3582,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"and as she had a desire to see the proof-sheet of her poem, and heard"
3583,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"that help was needed at the office, she said to Uriah, ""I feel bad to"
3584,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"have you staying on my account, when it seems you might be accomplishing"
3585,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"more good."" It was thought she might live till frosty nights, if no"
3586,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"longer. Under these considerations, Uriah left for Rochester the 17th of"
3587,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"July. He had not been gone with the manuscript; more than three hours,"
3588,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"when she said, ""I am ready now to die;"" and she did not live quite ten"
3589,ANNIE R. SMITH.,days after.
3590,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3591,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"The 18th she wrote the piece ""Our Duty."" The 19th, at 3 o'clock, P. M.,"
3592,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"she said, ""Mother, some change has taken place. I don't think I shall"
3593,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"live through the day."" I saw there was a change, and stayed by her. Night"
3594,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"drew on. No one happened in. She said, ""It seems to me I could not"
3595,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"breathe to have many in the room."" I told her I was not afraid to be"
3596,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"alone with her if she did die. She seemed gratified, as she wanted"
3597,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"everything as quiet as could be, and she was not able to talk much with"
3598,ANNIE R. SMITH.,people if they were in. Her brother John and myself stayed with her
3599,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"during the night, when it seemed that any moment might be her last. She"
3600,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"delivered many messages for different individuals, especially for her"
3601,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"brother Samuel, if she did not live to see him. She said, ""My mind was"
3602,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"never clearer; I could do a sum in arithmetic."""
3603,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3604,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"About 2 o'clock she looked very happy. I said to John, ""Annie is being"
3605,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"blessed."" She soon exclaimed, ""Glory to God,"" a number of times, louder"
3606,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"than she had spoken for a long while. She said, ""Heaven is opened. I know"
3607,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Jesus is mine, and that he will save me. I shall come forth at the first"
3608,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"resurrection;"" and exhorted us to prepare for the time of trouble, and to"
3609,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"be ready to meet her at that day, which she said she did not think was"
3610,ANNIE R. SMITH.,far distant.
3611,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3612,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Friday morning, the 20th, I wanted to write to Uriah, but she said ""It"
3613,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"will make no difference, I think I am dying; don't leave me, mother,"
3614,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"while I live."" We sent for Samuel, and for sister Gorham. She remained"
3615,ANNIE R. SMITH.,about the same. Those who came in thought she must be just gone. They
3616,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"said it did not seem like a sick and dying room, she appeared so happy."
3617,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"She would look upon them and smile when she could not speak. Sabbath,"
3618,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"July 21, she seemed better. Sunday, the 22d, more distressed, though she"
3619,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"had some pleasing, and I trust profitable intercourse with her relatives"
3620,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"and some of her particular friends. Monday morning, more comfortable."
3621,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Some of us entertained hopes that she might, even then, revive and live."
3622,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Monday night her distress returned. She said, ""I think I cannot live."""
3623,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Thursday morning, the 24th, she composed her last two verses, ""Oh! shed"
3624,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"not a tear o'er the spot where I sleep,"" &c. In the afternoon she had a"
3625,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"conflict with the enemy, and seemed to lose sight of Jesus. I told her it"
3626,ANNIE R. SMITH.,was no strange thing; it was only a sign the Lord was near and would
3627,ANNIE R. SMITH.,deliver. She found it even so. Before night she was enabled to triumph
3628,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"over all the powers of darkness, and praised God aloud. She prayed for"
3629,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"patience to suffer all her Father's will, saying, ""I shall not suffer any"
3630,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"too much. I can bear anything while Jesus sustains me;"" and many like"
3631,ANNIE R. SMITH.,expressions.
3632,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3633,ANNIE R. SMITH.,Tuesday night was a solemn and interesting night. I stayed with her alone
3634,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"through the night. Neither of us slept. She was very happy, and talked"
3635,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"much with me. She said in her former familiar way, ""My mother, I've been"
3636,ANNIE R. SMITH.,afraid I should wear you all out. I've called after you by night and by
3637,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"day."" She felt bad to have me kept up as I was on her account. But she"
3638,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"said, ""I am here now, your dying girl. I think this is the last night,"
3639,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"and you must be sure to rest when I am gone. O, my blessed mother, I"
3640,ANNIE R. SMITH.,shall bless you in Heaven for taking such care of me. No sorrow or
3641,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"suffering there. We shall all be free there. Yes, we shall all be free"
3642,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"when we arrive at home, and we shall live forever. Yes, and I can smile"
3643,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"upon you now through all my sufferings."" It was her last suffering night."
3644,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"Wednesday, the 25th, a death coldness was upon her. In the afternoon she"
3645,ANNIE R. SMITH.,became more free from pain and distress. While speaking in the evening of
3646,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"taking care of her, she said, ""I shall not want any one to sit up; you"
3647,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"can lie on the lounge."" At 1 o'clock I called Samuel. She talked with"
3648,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"him, called for what she wanted as usual, and told him he might lie down."
3649,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"About three o'clock she called him to wet her head with water, and said"
3650,ANNIE R. SMITH.,she felt sleepy. She was indeed going into her last sleep. Samuel wet her
3651,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"head, and soon after spoke to me and said, ""I don't know but Annie is"
3652,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"dying."" I spoke to her. She took no notice, breathed a few times, and"
3653,ANNIE R. SMITH.,died apparently as easy as any one going into a natural sleep. Her
3654,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"sufferings were over. She was gone. It was 4 o'clock in the morning, July"
3655,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"26, 1855."
3656,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3657,ANNIE R. SMITH.,She gave many directions about her burial; wanted as little parade as
3658,ANNIE R. SMITH.,possible. We were expecting Bro. and sister White. We had had a letter
3659,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"from Bro. H. O. Nichols, saying they were expected there, and would be"
3660,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"likely to call on us about that time. Brn. Bates, Burr and Nichols were"
3661,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"written to, but circumstances prevented any of them from attending her"
3662,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"funeral. Bro. Hastings and others spoke, prayed, and sung, to the"
3663,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"edification of all. The hymns selected were, ""Unconscious now in peaceful"
3664,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"sleep,"" and ""She hath passed death's chilling billow."" It has since been"
3665,ANNIE R. SMITH.,said by the friends that they never attended a more interesting funeral.
3666,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3667,ANNIE R. SMITH.,Annie looked very natural; more so than at any time after she came home.
3668,ANNIE R. SMITH.,It was remarked that a holy sweetness seemed to rest upon her
3669,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"countenance, while her remains were with us. Annie had many favors shown"
3670,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"her. For the interest and friendship manifested, the friends have my"
3671,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"sincere love and gratitude. Though I ever thought much of them, they seem"
3672,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"doubly dear since her death, especially Bro. and sister White, with whom"
3673,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"she was so long connected. Annie loved them, and manifested an interest"
3674,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"for them, and the work there till the last. Bro. White made her the"
3675,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"generous donation of seventy-five dollars and other valuable presents,"
3676,ANNIE R. SMITH.,during her sickness.
3677,ANNIE R. SMITH.,
3678,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"It was a great satisfaction that I had Annie with me, and that I was"
3679,ANNIE R. SMITH.,enabled to take care of her while she lived. Her complaints required an
3680,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"uneven temperature of the room, which was unfavorable for me. I took one"
3681,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"cold after another, and was very much worn down at the time of her death."
3682,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"I took an additional cold when she was buried, and have scarcely been"
3683,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"able to do anything since. I have thought sometimes, that what I had the"
3684,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"privilege of doing for Annie, was worth my life, if it must go; and if it"
3685,ANNIE R. SMITH.,"were not that I was still needed as a mother, I would now myself"
3686,ANNIE R. SMITH.,willingly lay off the burden of life's duties and cares.

4877,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4878,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4879,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",We've met again within these halls--
4880,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","These halls to mem'ry dear,"
4881,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Where scenes of harmony and peace
4882,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Have filled the by-gone year.
4883,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",But e'en while recollections fond
4884,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Still cling around the heart,"
4885,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",One bitter thought disturbs our joy:
4886,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",For we have met to part.
4887,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4888,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Full well we know, our path through life"
4889,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Can ne'er be always bright;
4890,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",The sweetest hours to mortals given
4891,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Are swiftest in their flight.
4892,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Then let us follow duty's call,"
4893,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","With calm, undaunted brow,"
4894,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Nor weakly chide the stern behest,"
4895,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Which separates us now.
4896,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4897,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Ye whom this consecrated spot
4898,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Still sheds its blessings o'er,"
4899,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Use well the moments as they pass,"
4900,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",For they return no more.
4901,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Here you must gird your armor on,"
4902,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Survey the field of life,"
4903,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","And then go forth to earn a name,"
4904,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Or perish in the strife.
4905,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4906,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Great men have been before us here,"
4907,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Whose fame the wide world knows;
4908,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",_Excelsior_ still shines for us--
4909,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",The star by which they rose.
4910,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",They're shedding now a mighty spell
4911,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",On all the paths we tread;
4912,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","On living brows bloom laurel wreaths,"
4913,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",While cypress mourns the dead.
4914,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4915,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Then let us form the high resolve
4916,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","To make our lives sublime,"
4917,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",And mark a clear and noble track
4918,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Upon the sands of time,"
4919,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",And bring fresh honors to the list
4920,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Of men and heroes all,"
4921,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Whose power is felt from pole to pole--
4922,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",The sons of Phillips' Hall.

4928,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4929,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4930,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","The wheels of time roll ceaseless on,"
4931,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",The moments glide away;
4932,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","The hours but tell us they are gone,"
4933,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Nor lingers long the day.
4934,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","So that from friends, and home, away"
4935,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","I shall not long remain,"
4936,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",For soon the flying wings of time
4937,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Will bear me home again.
4938,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4939,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",I have a home--oh! blessed thought!--
4940,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Which oft I call to mind;
4941,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Which oft a healing balm has brought,"
4942,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",And left dull care behind.
4943,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","From this dear home, though far away,"
4944,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","I cannot long remain,"
4945,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","The ties of friendship, sure and strong,"
4946,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Will bring me home again.
4947,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4948,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",In fancy's vision oft I see
4949,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Friendship's extended hand,"
4950,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","And for a moment seem to be,"
4951,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",One in your happy band;
4952,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",But recollection suffers not
4953,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","These visions to remain,"
4954,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","And so to see you face to face,"
4955,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",I'm coming home again.
4956,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4957,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",The boisterous waves roll rough around
4958,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",My thin and slender bark;
4959,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","While clouds arise, and storms resound,"
4960,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",And all is drear and dark.
4961,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",But out upon the swelling tide
4962,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","I shall not long remain,"
4963,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",For I'm coming into harbor--
4964,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",I'm coming home again.
4965,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4966,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4967,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4968,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4969,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Charity.
4970,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4971,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4972,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","There is a way more excellent, so traced the sacred pen,"
4973,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Than e'en to share the precious gifts which God vouchsafes to men;
4974,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","It is to draw for every act our motive from above,"
4975,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",And make our whole of mortal life a holocaust of love.
4976,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4977,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","For though the mind with all the wealth of human lore expand,"
4978,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Though e'en an angel's glowing words we hold at our command,"
4979,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","If in each thought and word expressed, no charity abound,"
4980,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","'Twill but be like the tinkling brass, the cymbal's hollow sound."
4981,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4982,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","And though all knowledge we possessed, all mysteries could prove,"
4983,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Had faith to bid the rugged mount to yonder sea remove,"
4984,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","If charity dwell not within, the all-inspiring power,"
4985,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","We are but cyphers in the scale, the beings of an hour."
4986,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4987,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","And though our goods we freely give to meet the sufferer's need,"
4988,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","And yield our bodies to the stake, the fiery flame to feed;"
4989,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","If charity prompt not these acts, so fair to human sight,"
4990,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",It profits nothing in His eyes who reads the heart aright.
4991,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4992,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",For charity is but the name for every heavenly grace;
4993,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","With human weakness long she bears, to anger ne'er gives place;"
4994,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Her features fair with kindness glow, no envy stirs her breast,"
4995,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Nor e'er by boastful acts or words is inward pride expressed.
4996,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
4997,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","She ever seeketh others' good, regardless of her own;"
4998,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","She thinks no evil, speaks no ill, by act, or look, or tone;"
4999,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Not in iniquity, but truth, doth she her comfort take,"
5000,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","And bears, believes, endures, and hopes, all things, for Jesus' sake."

5002,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Hail, holy Charity! bright daughter of the skies!"
5003,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","An angel from the ruins of our once fair paradise,"

5006,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
5007,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","In the dark places of the earth thy footsteps may we trace,"
5008,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",By fruitful fields and verdant plains where once were desert wastes.
5009,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","The orphan rises up with joy thy coming steps to bless,"
5010,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","And widows, smiling through their tears, their grateful thanks express."
5011,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
5012,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","To clothe the naked, feed the poor, bestowing joy for pain;"
5013,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",To bring relief to those who long in suffering have lain;
5014,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","To cause the sad, despondent heart to sing aloud for joy--"
5015,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","These are thy works, sweet Charity, thy holy, blest employ."

5029,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
5030,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","Dark is the hour when Death prevails,"
5031,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",And triumphs o'er the just--
5032,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","A painful void within the breast,"
5033,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",When dust goes back to dust;
5034,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","And solemn is the pall, the bier,"

5037,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.","But there's a bright, a glorious hope,"

5043,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",
5044,"POEMS, BY URIAH SMITH.",Then mourn we not as those whose hopes
