44,NOTE,With singular unanimity critics for thirty years have slighted the work
45,NOTE,"of Arthur Machen. A line suffices for him in Holbrook Jackson's ""The"
46,NOTE,"Eighteen Nineties,"" and Mr. Blaikie-Murdoch ignores him completely in"
47,NOTE,"""The Renaissance of the Nineties""; yet those are the standard works on"
48,NOTE,"the period to which, chronologically, at least, Machen belongs. Mr."
49,NOTE,"Turquet-Milnes, with greater appreciation, gives him a half-chapter in"
50,NOTE,"his scholarly work, ""The Influence of Baudelaire,"" but even that is made"
51,NOTE,"up largely of quotations from ""The Hill of Dreams,"" to prove Machen a"
52,NOTE,descendent of Baudelaire--an error to which I subscribed until Machen
53,NOTE,"himself disillusioned me, although the assertion is still partially"
54,NOTE,true.
55,NOTE,
56,NOTE,"Because, in my opinion, Arthur Machen is the outstanding artist of his"
57,NOTE,"time, and one of the great masters of all time, I wrote the following"
58,NOTE,"paper, which first appeared in Reedy's _Mirror_ for October 5, 1917."
59,NOTE,"That issue is not now obtainable, and, as calls for it continue to come"
60,NOTE,"to me and to the publisher, I find ground for a belief that Machen may,"
61,NOTE,"at length, be coming into his own, a tardy phenomenon which I am happy"
62,NOTE,to hasten so far as it lies within my power. Mr. Walter M. Hill shares
63,NOTE,this feeling and this brochure is the result.
64,NOTE,
65,NOTE,I am indebted to Mr. William Marion Reedy for permission to reprint
66,NOTE,those parts of the article which appeared in his journal.

74,ARTHUR MACHEN,
75,ARTHUR MACHEN,
76,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Some thirty odd years ago a young man of twenty-two, the son of a Welsh"
77,ARTHUR MACHEN,"clergyman, fresh from school and with his head full of a curiously"
78,ARTHUR MACHEN,"occult mediaevalism, privately acquired from yellowed palimpsests and"
79,ARTHUR MACHEN,"dog-eared volumes of black letter, wrote a classic. More, he had it"
80,ARTHUR MACHEN,"published. Only one review copy was sent out; that was to _Le Livre_, of"
81,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Paris. It fell into the hands of Octave Uzanne, who instantly ordered"
82,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Rabelais and Boccaccio to ""shove over"" on the immortal seats and make"
83,ARTHUR MACHEN,"room by their side for the author. The book was ""The Chronicle of"
84,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Clemendy""; the author, Arthur Machen."
85,ARTHUR MACHEN,
86,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Three years ago, about, not long after the great war first shook the"
87,ARTHUR MACHEN,"world, a London evening newspaper published inconspicuously a purely"
88,ARTHUR MACHEN,fictional account of a supposed incident of the British retreat from
89,ARTHUR MACHEN,Mons. It described the miraculous intervention of the English archers of
90,ARTHUR MACHEN,Agincourt at a time when the British were sore pressed by the German
91,ARTHUR MACHEN,"hordes. Immediately, churchmen, spiritualists, and a host of others,"
92,ARTHUR MACHEN,seized upon it as an authentic record and the miracle as an omen. In the
93,ARTHUR MACHEN,"hysteria that followed, Arthur Machen, its author, found himself a"
94,ARTHUR MACHEN,"talked-of man, because he wrote to the papers denying that the narrative"
95,ARTHUR MACHEN,"was factual. Later, when his little volume, ""The Bowmen and Other"
96,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Legends of the War,"" appeared in print, it met with an extraordinary and"
97,ARTHUR MACHEN,rather impertinent success.
98,ARTHUR MACHEN,
99,ARTHUR MACHEN,But what had Machen been doing all those long years between 1885 and
100,ARTHUR MACHEN,1914?
101,ARTHUR MACHEN,
102,ARTHUR MACHEN,"In a day of haphazard fiction and rodomontade criticism, the advent of a"
103,ARTHUR MACHEN,"master workman is likely to be unheralded, if, indeed, he is fortunate"
104,ARTHUR MACHEN,enough to find a publisher to put him between covers. Mr. Machen is not
105,ARTHUR MACHEN,"a newcomer, however, as we have seen; no immediate success with a ""best"
106,ARTHUR MACHEN,"seller"" furnishes an incentive for a complimentary notice. He is an"
107,ARTHUR MACHEN,"unknown, in spite of ""Clemendy,"" in spite of ""The Bowmen,"" in spite of"
108,ARTHUR MACHEN,"everything. For thirty years he has been writing English prose, a period"
109,ARTHUR MACHEN,"ample for the making of a dozen reputations of the ordinary kind, and in"
110,ARTHUR MACHEN,that time he has produced just ten books. In thirty years Harold
111,ARTHUR MACHEN,Bindloss and Rex Beach will have written one-hundred-and-ten books and
112,ARTHUR MACHEN,sold the moving picture rights of them all.
113,ARTHUR MACHEN,
114,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Of course, it is exactly because he does not write books of the ordinary"
115,ARTHUR MACHEN,kind that Arthur Machen's reputation as a writer was not made long ago.
116,ARTHUR MACHEN,His apotheosis will begin after his death. The insectial fame of the
117,ARTHUR MACHEN,"""popular"" novelist is immediate; it is born at dawn and dies at sunset."
118,ARTHUR MACHEN,"The enduring fame of the artist too often is born at sunset, but it is"
119,ARTHUR MACHEN,immortal.
120,ARTHUR MACHEN,
121,ARTHUR MACHEN,"More than Hawthorne or Tolstoy, Machen is a novelist of the soul. He"
122,ARTHUR MACHEN,"writes of a strange borderland, lying somewhere between Dreams and"
123,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Death, peopled with shades, beings, spirits, ghosts, men, women,"
124,ARTHUR MACHEN,souls--what shall we call them?--the very notion of whom stops vaguely
125,ARTHUR MACHEN,just short of thought. He writes of the life Satyr-ic. For him Pan is
126,ARTHUR MACHEN,not dead; his votaries still whirl through woodland windings to the mad
127,ARTHUR MACHEN,"pipe that was Syrinx, and carouse fiercely in enchanted forest grottoes"
128,ARTHUR MACHEN,"(hidden somewhere, perhaps, in the fourth dimension!). His meddling with"
129,ARTHUR MACHEN,"the crucibles of science is appalling in its daring, its magnificence,"
130,ARTHUR MACHEN,"and its horror. Even the greater works of fictional psychology--""Dr."
131,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" if you like--shrink before his astounding"
132,ARTHUR MACHEN,inferences and suggestions.
133,ARTHUR MACHEN,
134,ARTHUR MACHEN,It is his theory that the fearful and shocking rites of the Bacchic
135,ARTHUR MACHEN,cultus survive in this disillusioned age; that Panic lechery and
136,ARTHUR MACHEN,"wickedness did not cease with the Agony, as Mrs. Browning and others"
137,ARTHUR MACHEN,would have us believe.
138,ARTHUR MACHEN,
139,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Of Hawthorne, Arthur Symons wrote: ""He is haunted by what is obscure,"
140,ARTHUR MACHEN,"dangerous, and on the confines of good and evil."" Machen crosses those"
141,ARTHUR MACHEN,"perilous frontiers. He all but lifts the veil; himself, indeed, passes"
142,ARTHUR MACHEN,"beyond it. But the curtain drops behind him and we, hesitating to"
143,ARTHUR MACHEN,"follow, see only dimly the phantasmagoria beyond; the ecstasies of vague"
144,ARTHUR MACHEN,"shapes with a shining about them, on the one hand; on the other the"
145,ARTHUR MACHEN,"writhings of animate gargoyles. And we experience, I think, a distinct"
146,ARTHUR MACHEN,sense of gratitude toward this terrible guide for that we are permitted
147,ARTHUR MACHEN,no closer view of the mysteries that seem to him so clear.
148,ARTHUR MACHEN,
149,ARTHUR MACHEN,"We glimpse his secrets in transfiguring flashes from afar, as Launcelot"
150,ARTHUR MACHEN,"viewed the San Graal, and, like that tarnished knight, we quest vainly a"
151,ARTHUR MACHEN,"tangible solution, half in apprehension, always in glamour. But it is"
152,ARTHUR MACHEN,like Galahad we must seek the eternal mysteries that obsess Arthur
153,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Machen. There is no solution but in absolution, for it is the mysteries"
154,ARTHUR MACHEN,"of life and death of which he writes, and of life-in-death and"
155,ARTHUR MACHEN,death-in-life. This with particular reference to Machen's two most
156,ARTHUR MACHEN,"important books, ""The House of Souls"" and ""The Hill of Dreams,"" in which"
157,ARTHUR MACHEN,he reaches his greatest stature as a novelist of the soul.
158,ARTHUR MACHEN,
159,ARTHUR MACHEN,"There are those who will call him a novelist of Sin, quibbling about a"
160,ARTHUR MACHEN,definition. With these I have no quarrel; the characterizations are
161,ARTHUR MACHEN,synonymous. His books exhale all evil and all corruption; yet they are
162,ARTHUR MACHEN,as pure as the fabled waters of that crystal spring De Leon sought. They
163,ARTHUR MACHEN,"are pervaded by an ever-present, intoxicating sense of sin, ravishingly"
164,ARTHUR MACHEN,"beautiful, furiously Pagan, frantically lovely; but Machen is a finer"
165,ARTHUR MACHEN,and truer mystic than the two-penny occultists who guide modern
166,ARTHUR MACHEN,spiritualistic thought. If we are to subscribe to his curious
167,ARTHUR MACHEN,"philosophy, to be discussed later, we must believe that there is no"
168,ARTHUR MACHEN,paradox in this.
169,ARTHUR MACHEN,
170,ARTHUR MACHEN,"But something of what we are getting at is explained in his own pages,"
171,ARTHUR MACHEN,"in this opening paragraph from his story, ""The White People,"" in ""The"
172,ARTHUR MACHEN,"House of Souls"": ""'Sorcery and sanctity,' said Ambrose, 'these are the"
173,ARTHUR MACHEN,"only realities. Each is an ecstasy, a withdrawal from the common life.'"""
174,ARTHUR MACHEN,"And, a little later, in this: ""'There is something profoundly unnatural"
175,ARTHUR MACHEN,about sin ... the essence of which really is in the taking of heaven by
176,ARTHUR MACHEN,"storm.'"""
177,ARTHUR MACHEN,
178,ARTHUR MACHEN,One gathers from a general vagueness on the subject that sin is not
179,ARTHUR MACHEN,"popular in these times. There are, of course, new sins and advanced sins"
180,ARTHUR MACHEN,"and higher sins, all of which are intensely interesting. The chief"
181,ARTHUR MACHEN,"puzzle to the lay mind is why they should bear these names, since they"
182,ARTHUR MACHEN,"are usually neither new, advanced and high, nor particularly sinful. I"
183,ARTHUR MACHEN,"am speaking of sin as an offense against the nature of things, and of"
184,ARTHUR MACHEN,"evil in the soul, which has very little to do with the sins of the"
185,ARTHUR MACHEN,"statute book. Sin, according to the same Ambrose I have quoted, is"
186,ARTHUR MACHEN,conceivable in the talking of animals. If a chair should walk across a
187,ARTHUR MACHEN,"room, that would be sinful, or if a tree sat down with us to afternoon"
188,ARTHUR MACHEN,tea. The savage who worships a conjurer is a far finer moralist than
189,ARTHUR MACHEN,the civilise who suspects him--and I use the name moralist for one who
190,ARTHUR MACHEN,has an appreciation of sin.
191,ARTHUR MACHEN,
192,ARTHUR MACHEN,This is not the sin of the legal code. _Ambrose_ I conceive to be Arthur
193,ARTHUR MACHEN,Machen. There are only two realities; sorcery and sanctity--sin and
194,ARTHUR MACHEN,sainthood--and each is an ecstasy. Arthur Machen's is the former.
195,ARTHUR MACHEN,
196,ARTHUR MACHEN,Perhaps his most remarkable story--certainly I think his most terrible
197,ARTHUR MACHEN,"story, is ""The Great God Pan,"" at first published separately with ""The"
198,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Inmost Light""; now occurring in ""The House of Souls."" It is the story of"
199,ARTHUR MACHEN,"an experiment upon a girl, as a result of which, for a moment, she is"
200,ARTHUR MACHEN,"permitted a sight of the Great God, beyond the veil, with shocking"
201,ARTHUR MACHEN,"consequences. Yet it is told with exquisite reticence and grace, and"
202,ARTHUR MACHEN,with a plausibility that is as extraordinary as it is immoral. Here is
203,ARTHUR MACHEN,the conclusion of that story:
204,ARTHUR MACHEN,
205,ARTHUR MACHEN,"""What I said Mary would see, she saw, but I forgot that no human"
206,ARTHUR MACHEN,"eyes could look on such a vision with impunity. And I forgot, as I"
207,ARTHUR MACHEN,"have just said, that when the house of life is thus thrown open,"
208,ARTHUR MACHEN,"there may enter in that for which we have no name, and human flesh"
209,ARTHUR MACHEN,may become the veil of a horror one dare not express.... The
210,ARTHUR MACHEN,"blackened face, the hideous form upon the bed, changing and melting"
211,ARTHUR MACHEN,"before your eyes from woman to man, from man to beast, and from"
212,ARTHUR MACHEN,"beast to worse than beast, all the strange horror that you"
213,ARTHUR MACHEN,"witnessed, surprises me but little. What you say the doctor you"
214,ARTHUR MACHEN,"sent for saw and shuddered at, I noticed long ago; I knew what I"
215,ARTHUR MACHEN,"had done the moment the child was born, and when it was five years"
216,ARTHUR MACHEN,"old I surprised it, not once or twice, but several times, with a"
217,ARTHUR MACHEN,"playmate, you may guess of what kind.... And now Helen is with her"
218,ARTHUR MACHEN,"companions."""
219,ARTHUR MACHEN,
220,ARTHUR MACHEN,There is the very quintessence of horror in the unutterable suggestion
221,ARTHUR MACHEN,"of such passages. As for ""The Hill of Dreams,"" I have found its reading"
222,ARTHUR MACHEN,one of the most desolate and appalling experiences in literature.
223,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Reading it, himself, years after publication, its author decided that it"
224,ARTHUR MACHEN,"was a ""depressing book."" That is undoubtedly true, but spiritually as"
225,ARTHUR MACHEN,well as technically it marks to date the topmost pinnacle of his
226,ARTHUR MACHEN,tormented genius. It reaches heights so rarefied that breathing
227,ARTHUR MACHEN,literally becomes painful. To the casual reader this sounds absurd;
228,ARTHUR MACHEN,hyperbolical if not hypocritical rant; but in a day when a majority of
229,ARTHUR MACHEN,critics find it difficult to restrain themselves in speaking of Harold
230,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Bell Wright, and place Jeffery Farnol beside Fielding and Thackeray, one"
231,ARTHUR MACHEN,cannot go far wrong in indulging a few enthusiasms for so genuine an
232,ARTHUR MACHEN,artist as Arthur Machen.
233,ARTHUR MACHEN,
234,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Of the reviewers into whose hands fell this remarkable book, in the year"
235,ARTHUR MACHEN,"of its publication, 1907, only one appears to have valued it at its real"
236,ARTHUR MACHEN,"worth--the editor of _The Academy_, who, carried away by the tale and"
237,ARTHUR MACHEN,"its telling, turned out a bit of critical prose which might have been"
238,ARTHUR MACHEN,"lifted from the book, itself. ""There is something sinister in the beauty"
239,ARTHUR MACHEN,"of Mr. Machen's book,"" he wrote. ""It is like some strangely shaped"
240,ARTHUR MACHEN,"orchid, the colour of which is fierce and terrible, and its perfume is"
241,ARTHUR MACHEN,haunting to suffocation by reason of its intolerable sweetness. The
242,ARTHUR MACHEN,cruelty of the book is more savage than any of the cruelty which the
243,ARTHUR MACHEN,book describes. Lucian shuddered at the boys who were deliberately
244,ARTHUR MACHEN,hanging an ungainly puppy; he had thrashed the little ruffian who
245,ARTHUR MACHEN,"kicked the sick cat, before he wrapped himself away from the contact of"
246,ARTHUR MACHEN,such infamy in the shelter of his own imaginings. For in 'The Hill of
247,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Dreams' you seem to be shown a lovely, sensitive boy who has fashioned"
248,ARTHUR MACHEN,himself a white palace of beauty in his own mind. He has had time only
249,ARTHUR MACHEN,"to realize its full beauty when disease lays its cold touch upon him,"
250,ARTHUR MACHEN,"and gathers him into her grasp, until he lies decaying and horrible,"
251,ARTHUR MACHEN,seeing his own decay and seeing that his decay makes the white palace
252,ARTHUR MACHEN,foul. The boys did not chant songs as they looped the string round the
253,ARTHUR MACHEN,neck of the uncouth puppy. Mr. Machen fashions prose out of the
254,ARTHUR MACHEN,"writhings of Lucian, who is dear to him: and his prose has the rhythmic"
255,ARTHUR MACHEN,"beat of some dreadful Oriental instrument, insistent, monotonous,"
256,ARTHUR MACHEN,"haunting; and still the soft tone of one careful flute sounds on, and"
257,ARTHUR MACHEN,keeps the nerves alive to the slow and growing pain of the rhythmic
258,ARTHUR MACHEN,beat. Lucian in ecstacy of worship for the young girl whose lips have
259,ARTHUR MACHEN,"given him a new life, pressed his body against sharp thorns until the"
260,ARTHUR MACHEN,"white flesh of his body was red with drops of blood. That, too, is the"
261,ARTHUR MACHEN,spirit of the book. It is like some dreadful liturgy of self-inflicted
262,ARTHUR MACHEN,"pain, set to measured music: and the cadence of that music becomes"
263,ARTHUR MACHEN,intolerable by its suave phrasing and perfect modulation. The last long
264,ARTHUR MACHEN,"chapter with its recurring themes is a masterpiece of prose, and in its"
265,ARTHUR MACHEN,"way unique."""
266,ARTHUR MACHEN,
267,ARTHUR MACHEN,"After that, there would seem to be no need for further comment on ""The"
268,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Hill of Dreams."" But there is--there is!"
269,ARTHUR MACHEN,
270,ARTHUR MACHEN,Quite as important as what Mr. Machen says is his manner of saying it.
271,ARTHUR MACHEN,He possesses an English prose style which in its mystical suggestion and
272,ARTHUR MACHEN,beauty is unlike any other I have encountered. There is ecstacy in his
273,ARTHUR MACHEN,pages. Joris-Karl Huysmans in a really good translation suggests Machen
274,ARTHUR MACHEN,"better, perhaps, than another; both are debtors to Baudelaire.[1]"
275,ARTHUR MACHEN,
276,ARTHUR MACHEN,"The ""ecstasy"" one finds in Machen's work (of which more anon) is due in"
277,ARTHUR MACHEN,"no small degree to his beautiful English ""style""--an abominable word."
278,ARTHUR MACHEN,"But Machen is no mere word-juggler. His vocabulary, while astonishing"
279,ARTHUR MACHEN,"and extensive, is not affectedly so. Yet his sentences move to sonorous,"
280,ARTHUR MACHEN,"half-submerged rhythms, swooning with pagan color and redolent of"
281,ARTHUR MACHEN,sacerdotal incense. What is the secret of this graceful English method?
282,ARTHUR MACHEN,It is this: he achieves his striking results and effects through his
283,ARTHUR MACHEN,noteworthy gift of selection and arrangement. I had reached this
284,ARTHUR MACHEN,"conclusion, I think, before I encountered a passage from ""The Hill of"
285,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Dreams,"" which clinched it:"
286,ARTHUR MACHEN,
287,ARTHUR MACHEN,"""Language, he understood, was chiefly important for the beauty of"
288,ARTHUR MACHEN,"its sounds, by its possession of words resonant, glorious to the"
289,ARTHUR MACHEN,"ear, by its capacity, when exquisitely arranged, of suggesting"
290,ARTHUR MACHEN,"wonderful and indefinable impressions, perhaps more ravishing and"
291,ARTHUR MACHEN,further removed from the domain of strict thought than the
292,ARTHUR MACHEN,impressions excited by music itself. Here lay hidden the secret of
293,ARTHUR MACHEN,"suggestion, the art of causing sensation by the use of words."""
294,ARTHUR MACHEN,
295,ARTHUR MACHEN,Was it ever better expressed? He defines his method and exhibits its
296,ARTHUR MACHEN,results at the same time. And dipping almost at random into the same
297,ARTHUR MACHEN,"volume, here is a further example of the method:"
298,ARTHUR MACHEN,
299,ARTHUR MACHEN,"""Slowly and timidly he began to untie his boots, fumbling with the"
300,ARTHUR MACHEN,"laces, and glancing all the while on every side at the ugly,"
301,ARTHUR MACHEN,"misshapen trees that hedged the lawn. Not a branch was straight,"
302,ARTHUR MACHEN,"not one was free, but all were interlaced and grew one about"
303,ARTHUR MACHEN,"another; and just above ground, where the cankered stems joined the"
304,ARTHUR MACHEN,"protuberant roots, there were forms that imitated the human shape,"
305,ARTHUR MACHEN,and faces and twining limbs that amazed him. Green mosses were
306,ARTHUR MACHEN,"hair, and tresses were stark in grey lichen; a twisted root swelled"
307,ARTHUR MACHEN,into a limb; in the hollows of the rooted bark he saw the masks of
308,ARTHUR MACHEN,"men.... As he gazed across the turf and into the thicket, the"
309,ARTHUR MACHEN,"sunshine seemed really to become green, and the contrast between"
310,ARTHUR MACHEN,the bright glow poured on the lawn and the black shadows of the
311,ARTHUR MACHEN,brake made an odd flickering light in which all the grotesque
312,ARTHUR MACHEN,postures of stem and root began to stir; the wood was alive. The
313,ARTHUR MACHEN,turf beneath him heaved and sunk as with the deep swell of the
314,ARTHUR MACHEN,"sea...."""
315,ARTHUR MACHEN,
316,ARTHUR MACHEN,And:
317,ARTHUR MACHEN,
318,ARTHUR MACHEN,"""He could imagine a man who was able to live on one sense while he"
319,ARTHUR MACHEN,"pleased; to whom, for example, every impression of touch, taste,"
320,ARTHUR MACHEN,"hearing, or seeing should be translated into odor; who at the"
321,ARTHUR MACHEN,"desired kiss should be ravished with the scent of dark violets, to"
322,ARTHUR MACHEN,"whom music should be the perfume of a rose garden at dawn."""
323,ARTHUR MACHEN,
324,ARTHUR MACHEN,"This is not prose at all, but poetry, and poetry of a high order. And it"
325,ARTHUR MACHEN,"is from such beautiful manipulation of words, phrases, and rhythms that"
326,ARTHUR MACHEN,Machen attains his most clairvoyant and arresting effects in the realms
327,ARTHUR MACHEN,"of horror, dread, and terror; from the strange gesturings of trees, the"
328,ARTHUR MACHEN,"glow of furnace-like clouds, the somber beauty of brooding fields, and"
329,ARTHUR MACHEN,"valleys all too still, the mystery of lovely women, and all the terror"
330,ARTHUR MACHEN,of life and nature seen with the understanding eye.
331,ARTHUR MACHEN,
332,ARTHUR MACHEN,"So much for Arthur Machen as a novelist. It is a fascinating subject,"
333,ARTHUR MACHEN,"but it is also an extensive one, and the curious, tenuous quality of his"
334,ARTHUR MACHEN,work may lead one into indiscretions.

337,ARTHUR MACHEN,
338,ARTHUR MACHEN,"The peculiar philosophy of Arthur Machen is set down in ""Hieroglyphics"""
339,ARTHUR MACHEN,"and in ""Dr. Stiggins: His Views and Principles."" The first chapter of"
340,ARTHUR MACHEN,the latter work is a scathing satire on certain foibles and
341,ARTHUR MACHEN,"idiosyncracies of the American people--such as lynching, vote-buying,"
342,ARTHUR MACHEN,"and food-adulteration--but as it is, on the whole, a polemical volume"
343,ARTHUR MACHEN,"which, by the nature of the subjects it treats, can have less permanent"
344,ARTHUR MACHEN,"interest than the author's other work, it may be put to one side;"
345,ARTHUR MACHEN,although as a specimen of Machen's impeccable prose it must not be
346,ARTHUR MACHEN,ignored.
347,ARTHUR MACHEN,
348,ARTHUR MACHEN,"In ""Hieroglyphics"" he returns to those ecstasies mentioned in ""The White"
349,ARTHUR MACHEN,"People"" and gives us further definitions. The word ecstasy is merely a"
350,ARTHUR MACHEN,"symbol; it has many synonyms. It means rapture, adoration, a withdrawal"
351,ARTHUR MACHEN,"from common life, the other things. ""Who can furnish a precise"
352,ARTHUR MACHEN,definition of the indefinable? They (the 'other things') are sometimes
353,ARTHUR MACHEN,"in the song of a bird, sometimes in the whirl of a London street,"
354,ARTHUR MACHEN,"sometimes hidden under a great, lonely hill. Some of us seek them with"
355,ARTHUR MACHEN,"most hope and the fullest assurance in the sacring of the mass, others"
356,ARTHUR MACHEN,"receive tidings through the sound of music, in the color of a picture,"
357,ARTHUR MACHEN,"in the shining form of a statue, in the meditation of eternal truth."""
358,ARTHUR MACHEN,
359,ARTHUR MACHEN,"""Hieroglyphics"" is Arthur Machen's theory of literature, brilliantly"
360,ARTHUR MACHEN,"exposited by that ""cyclical mode of discoursing"" that was affected by"
361,ARTHUR MACHEN,Coleridge. In it he promulgates the admirable doctrine that fine
362,ARTHUR MACHEN,"literature must be, in effect, an allegory and not the careful history"
363,ARTHUR MACHEN,of particular persons. He seeks a mark of division which is to separate
364,ARTHUR MACHEN,"fine literature from mere literature, and finds the solution in the one"
365,ARTHUR MACHEN,"word ecstasy (or, if you prefer, beauty, wonder, awe, mystery, sense of"
366,ARTHUR MACHEN,"the unknown, desire for the unknown), with this conclusion: ""If ecstasy"
367,ARTHUR MACHEN,"be present, then I say there is fine literature, if it be absent, then,"
368,ARTHUR MACHEN,"in spite of all the cleverness, all the talents, all the workmanship and"
369,ARTHUR MACHEN,"observation and dexterity you may show me, then, I think, we have a"
370,ARTHUR MACHEN,"product (possibly a very interesting one) which is not fine literature."""
371,ARTHUR MACHEN,
372,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Following this reasoning, by an astonishing sequence of arguments, he"
373,ARTHUR MACHEN,"proceeds to the bold experiment of proving ""Pickwick"" possessed of"
374,ARTHUR MACHEN,"ecstasy, and ""Vanity Fair"" lacking it. The case is an extreme one, he"
375,ARTHUR MACHEN,"admits, deliberately chosen to expound his theory to the _n_th. degree."
376,ARTHUR MACHEN,The analytical key to the test is found in the differentiation between
377,ARTHUR MACHEN,"art and artifice, a nice problem in such extreme instances as Poe's"
378,ARTHUR MACHEN,"""Dupin"" stories and Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" as Mr. Machen"
379,ARTHUR MACHEN,"points out. By this ingenious method the ""Odyssey,"" ""Oedipus,"" ""Morte"
380,ARTHUR MACHEN,"D'Arthur,"" ""Kubla Khan,"" ""Don Quixote,"" and ""Rabelais"" immediately are"
381,ARTHUR MACHEN,"proven fine literature; a host of other esteemed works merely, if you"
382,ARTHUR MACHEN,"like, good literature."
383,ARTHUR MACHEN,
384,ARTHUR MACHEN,"""Pantagruel"" by a more delicate application of the test becomes a finer"
385,ARTHUR MACHEN,"work than ""Don Quixote,"" and in the exposition of this dictum we come"
386,ARTHUR MACHEN,upon one of the mountain peaks of Machen's amazing philosophy.
387,ARTHUR MACHEN,
388,ARTHUR MACHEN,He begins the discussion with a jest about the enormous capacity for
389,ARTHUR MACHEN,"strong drink exhibited by _Mr. Pickwick_ and his friends, and reminds us"
390,ARTHUR MACHEN,that it was the god of wine in whose honor Sophocles wrote his dramas
391,ARTHUR MACHEN,"and choral songs, who was worshipped and invoked at the Dionysiaca; and"
392,ARTHUR MACHEN,that all the drama arose from the celebration of the Bacchic mysteries.
393,ARTHUR MACHEN,"He goes on to the ""Gargantua"" and ""Pantagruel,"" which reek of wine as"
394,ARTHUR MACHEN,Dickens does of brandy and water.
395,ARTHUR MACHEN,
396,ARTHUR MACHEN,"The Rabelaisian history begins: ""_Grandgousier estoit bon raillard en"
397,ARTHUR MACHEN,"son temps, aimant à boire net_,"" and ends with the Oracle of the Holy"
398,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Bottle, with the word ""_Trinch ... un mot panomphée, celebré et entendu"
399,ARTHUR MACHEN,"de toutes nations, et nous signifie, beuvez_."" ""And I refer you,"""
400,ARTHUR MACHEN,"continues Machen, ""to the allocution of Bacbuc, the priestess of the"
401,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Bottle, at large. 'By wine,' she says, 'is man made divine,' and I may"
402,ARTHUR MACHEN,"say that if you have not got the key to these Rabelaisian riddles, much"
403,ARTHUR MACHEN,"of the value--the highest value--of the book is lost to you."""
404,ARTHUR MACHEN,
405,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Seeking the meaning of this Bacchic cultus, this apparent glorification"
406,ARTHUR MACHEN,"of drunkenness in all lands and in all times, from Ancient Greece"
407,ARTHUR MACHEN,"through Renascent France to Victorian England, by peoples and persons"
408,ARTHUR MACHEN,"not themselves given to excess, he finds it again in the word ecstasy."
409,ARTHUR MACHEN,
410,ARTHUR MACHEN,"""We are to conclude that both the ancient people and the modern"
411,ARTHUR MACHEN,"writers recognized ecstasy as the supreme gift and state of man,"
412,ARTHUR MACHEN,"and that they chose the Vine and the juice of the Vine, as the most"
413,ARTHUR MACHEN,beautiful and significant symbol of that Power which withdraws a
414,ARTHUR MACHEN,"man from the common life and the common consciousness, and taking"
415,ARTHUR MACHEN,"him from the dust of earth, sets him in high places, in the"
416,ARTHUR MACHEN,eternal world of ideas ... Let us never forget that the essence of
417,ARTHUR MACHEN,"the book ('Pantagruel') is in its splendid celebration of ecstasy,"
418,ARTHUR MACHEN,"under the figure of the Vine."""
419,ARTHUR MACHEN,
420,ARTHUR MACHEN,"At this point Mr. Machen places the ""key"" in our hands and declines"
421,ARTHUR MACHEN,further to reveal his secrets. In _Mr. Pickwick's_ overdose of milk
422,ARTHUR MACHEN,"punch we are to find, ultimately, ""a clue to the labyrinth of mystic"
423,ARTHUR MACHEN,"theology."""
424,ARTHUR MACHEN,
425,ARTHUR MACHEN,By his own test we are enabled to place Arthur Machen's greatest works
426,ARTHUR MACHEN,"on the shelf with ""Don Quixote"" and ""Pantagruel""; by his own test we"
427,ARTHUR MACHEN,"find the ecstasy of which he speaks in his own pages, under the symbol"
428,ARTHUR MACHEN,"of the Vine, and under figures even more beautiful and terrible. For"
429,ARTHUR MACHEN,minor consideration he finds in Rabelais another symbolism of ecstasy:
430,ARTHUR MACHEN,
431,ARTHUR MACHEN,"""The shape of gauloiserie, of gross, exuberant gaiety, expressing"
432,ARTHUR MACHEN,"itself by outrageous tales, outrageous words, by a very cataract of"
433,ARTHUR MACHEN,"obscenity, if you please, if only you will notice how the obscenity"
434,ARTHUR MACHEN,of Rabelais transcends the obscenity of common life; his grossness
435,ARTHUR MACHEN,"is poured out in a sort of mad torrent, in a frenzy, a very passion"
436,ARTHUR MACHEN,"of the unspeakable."""
437,ARTHUR MACHEN,
438,ARTHUR MACHEN,"In Cervantes he finds the greater deftness, the finer artifice, but he"
439,ARTHUR MACHEN,believes the conception of Rabelais the higher because it is the more
440,ARTHUR MACHEN,"remote. _Pantagruel's_ ""more than frankness, its ebullition of grossness"
441,ARTHUR MACHEN,"... is either the merest lunacy, or else it is sublime."" And the"
442,ARTHUR MACHEN,"paragraph that succeeds this one in the book, perhaps it is part of the"
443,ARTHUR MACHEN,"same paragraph, sums up this astonishing philosophy with a conclusion"
444,ARTHUR MACHEN,calculated to shock the Puritanic. Thus:
445,ARTHUR MACHEN,
446,ARTHUR MACHEN,"""Don't you perceive that when a certain depth has been passed you"
447,ARTHUR MACHEN,begin to ascend into the heights? The Persian poet expresses the
448,ARTHUR MACHEN,most transcendental secrets of the Divine Love by the grossest
449,ARTHUR MACHEN,phrases of the carnal love; so Rabelais soars above the common
450,ARTHUR MACHEN,"life, above the streets and the gutter, by going far lower than the"
451,ARTHUR MACHEN,streets and the gutter: he brings before you the highest by
452,ARTHUR MACHEN,"positing that which is lower than the lowest, and if you have the"
453,ARTHUR MACHEN,"prepared, initiated mind, a Rabelaisian 'list' is the best preface"
454,ARTHUR MACHEN,to the angelic song. (!) All this may strike you as extreme
455,ARTHUR MACHEN,"paradox, but it has the disadvantage of being true, and perhaps you"
456,ARTHUR MACHEN,may assure yourself of its truth by recollecting the converse
457,ARTHUR MACHEN,proposition--that it is when one is absorbed in the highest
458,ARTHUR MACHEN,"emotions that the most degrading images will intrude themselves."""
459,ARTHUR MACHEN,
460,ARTHUR MACHEN,And so on.... The sense of the futility almost of attempting to explain
461,ARTHUR MACHEN,Machen becomes more pronounced as I progress. You will have to read him.
462,ARTHUR MACHEN,You will find his books (if you are fortunate) in a murky corner of some
463,ARTHUR MACHEN,obscure second-hand bookshop.
464,ARTHUR MACHEN,
465,ARTHUR MACHEN,Arthur Machen was born in Wales in 1863. He is married and has two
466,ARTHUR MACHEN,"children. That is an astonishing thought, after reading ""The Inmost"
467,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Light."" It is surprising indeed to learn that he was _born_. He is High"
468,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Church, ""with no particular respect for the Archbishop of Canterbury,"""
469,ARTHUR MACHEN,"and necessarily subconsciously Catholic, as must be all those ""lonely,"
470,ARTHUR MACHEN,"awful souls"" who write ecstasy across the world. He hates puritanism"
471,ARTHUR MACHEN,with a sturdier hatred than inspires Chesterton; for a brilliant
472,ARTHUR MACHEN,exposition of this aversion I commend readers to his mocking
473,ARTHUR MACHEN,"introduction to ""The House of Souls."" That work, ""The Hill of Dreams,"""
474,ARTHUR MACHEN,"and ""Hieroglyphics"" were written between 1890 and 1900, after which"
475,ARTHUR MACHEN,their author turned strolling player and alternated for a time between
476,ARTHUR MACHEN,the smartest theatres in London and the shabbiest music halls in
477,ARTHUR MACHEN,London's East End. For the last six years or so he has been a
478,ARTHUR MACHEN,descriptive writer on the London _Evening News_.
479,ARTHUR MACHEN,
480,ARTHUR MACHEN,His works not before mentioned comprise a translation (the best)
481,ARTHUR MACHEN,"of the ""Heptameron""; ""Fantastic Tales,"" a collection of mediaeval"
482,ARTHUR MACHEN,"whimsies, partly translated and partly original and altogether"
483,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Rabelaisian and delightful; ""The Terror,"" a ""shilling shocker"" (his own"
484,ARTHUR MACHEN,"characterization), but a finer work withal than most of the ""literature"""
485,ARTHUR MACHEN,"of the day, and ""The Great Return,"" an extraordinary short tale which"
486,ARTHUR MACHEN,"may find place some day in another such collection as ""The House of"
487,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Souls."""
488,ARTHUR MACHEN,
489,ARTHUR MACHEN,"I have mentioned ""The Chronicle of Clemendy,"" calling it a classic, and"
490,ARTHUR MACHEN,something further should be said about that astonishing book. It is the
491,ARTHUR MACHEN,"Welsh ""Heptameron,"" a chronicle of amorous intrigue, joyous drunkenness,"
492,ARTHUR MACHEN,and knightly endeavor second to none in the brief muster of the world's
493,ARTHUR MACHEN,greatest classics. In it there is the veritable flavour of mediaeval
494,ARTHUR MACHEN,"record. Somewhat less outspoken than Balzac in his ""Droll Stories,"" and"
495,ARTHUR MACHEN,"less verbose than Boccaccio, Machen proves himself the peer of either in"
496,ARTHUR MACHEN,"gay, irresponsible, diverting, unflagging invention, while his diction"
497,ARTHUR MACHEN,"is lovelier than that of any of his forerunners, including the nameless"
498,ARTHUR MACHEN,authors of those rich Arabian tapestries which were the parent tales of
499,ARTHUR MACHEN,all mediaeval and modern facetiae.
500,ARTHUR MACHEN,
501,ARTHUR MACHEN,The day is coming when a number of serious charges will be laid against
502,ARTHUR MACHEN,"us who live in this generation, and some severe questions asked, and the"
503,ARTHUR MACHEN,"fact that we will be dead, most of us, when the future fires its"
504,ARTHUR MACHEN,"broadside, has nothing at all to do with the case."
505,ARTHUR MACHEN,
506,ARTHUR MACHEN,"We are going to be asked, _post-mortem_, why we allowed Ambrose Bierce"

508,ARTHUR MACHEN,"shamefully throughout his career; why Stephen Crane, after a few"
509,ARTHUR MACHEN,"flamboyant reviews, was so quickly forgotten at death; why Richard"
510,ARTHUR MACHEN,Middleton was permitted to swallow his poison at Brussels; why W.C.
511,ARTHUR MACHEN,Morrow and Walter Blackburn Harte were in our day known only to the

514,ARTHUR MACHEN,"demand of us why, when the opportunity was ours, we did not open our"

518,ARTHUR MACHEN,[Footnote 1: I have let this last assertion stand as part of the original
