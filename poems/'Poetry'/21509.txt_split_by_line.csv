151,ILLUSTRATIONS,Old Ragnor's Cliffs.
152,ILLUSTRATIONS,
153,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Like some horrific Gorgon's mammoth skull,"
154,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Thrown up by Titan spade,"
155,ILLUSTRATIONS,From out those caves
156,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Where saurians with mastodons had played,"
157,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Before the sea had made their homes their graves,"
158,ILLUSTRATIONS,"And scared their ghosts with screech of sea-born mew and gull,"
159,ILLUSTRATIONS,
160,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Is Ragnor's beetling brow, the seaman's dread,"
161,ILLUSTRATIONS,That scowls by night and day
162,ILLUSTRATIONS,On that same sea
163,ILLUSTRATIONS,"And with earth-shaking sound is heard to say,--"
164,ILLUSTRATIONS,Which sound the waves roll back with mocking glee--
165,ILLUSTRATIONS,"""What!  Not enough of life ye must e'en have the dead?"""
166,ILLUSTRATIONS,
167,ILLUSTRATIONS,The ragged remnants of an ancient crown
168,ILLUSTRATIONS,Adorn his kingly head:
169,ILLUSTRATIONS,'Tis Hastyngs' Tower.
170,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Here dwelt a maiden fair, so fair, 'tis said,"
171,ILLUSTRATIONS,"That suitors rich and princely sought her bower,"
172,ILLUSTRATIONS,To sue in vain: whereat her father's haughty brow would frown.
173,ILLUSTRATIONS,
174,ILLUSTRATIONS,
175,ILLUSTRATIONS,
176,ILLUSTRATIONS,
177,ILLUSTRATIONS,Sir Guy de Warre.
178,ILLUSTRATIONS,
179,ILLUSTRATIONS,Like Ragnor's rocks.  He swore that she should wed
180,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Sir Ralph of Normanhurst,"
181,ILLUSTRATIONS,His sister's son.
182,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Would not the Holy Church deem her accursed,"
183,ILLUSTRATIONS,Dared she defy his will and marry one
184,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Of her own choice!  Were't so, 'twere better she were dead!"
185,ILLUSTRATIONS,
186,ILLUSTRATIONS,"""Dear father, mine,"" Rowena pleaded sore,"
187,ILLUSTRATIONS,"On bended knee, ""The heart"
188,ILLUSTRATIONS,Belongs to God.
189,ILLUSTRATIONS,To wed where hallowed love can have no part
190,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Were sin, deserving His all-chastening rod,"
191,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Whose blessing on such tie 'twere impious to implore."""
192,ILLUSTRATIONS,
193,ILLUSTRATIONS,"""Sir Guy, my spouse, a mother's prayers, I too"
194,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Would blend with hers.  O yield,"
195,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Our only child,"
196,ILLUSTRATIONS,Possession sweet of woman's holy field--
197,ILLUSTRATIONS,Affection's glebe--a virgin soil denied
198,ILLUSTRATIONS,"When wedlock makes those one whose hearts can ne'er beat true."""

200,ILLUSTRATIONS,
201,ILLUSTRATIONS,
202,ILLUSTRATIONS,
203,ILLUSTRATIONS,Sir Harold Wynn.
204,ILLUSTRATIONS,
205,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Sir Guy de Warre, the fair Rowena's sire,"
206,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Of haughty Norman birth,"
207,ILLUSTRATIONS,"With pure descent,"
208,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Held Saxon, high or low, as scum of earth;"
209,ILLUSTRATIONS,"And deemed his name more worth and honour lent,"
210,ILLUSTRATIONS,Than line directly traced from Alfred could inspire.
211,ILLUSTRATIONS,
212,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Dark-visaged man, his countenance repelled;"
213,ILLUSTRATIONS,His restless eyes flashed fire;
214,ILLUSTRATIONS,His voice sent dread
215,ILLUSTRATIONS,Through every soul that felt his fearful ire.
216,ILLUSTRATIONS,At its fell sound both beast and children fled.
217,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Rowena, with her mother, hid till it had quelled."
218,ILLUSTRATIONS,
219,ILLUSTRATIONS,Sir Harold dared his daughter's hand to seek!
220,ILLUSTRATIONS,No word the fierce knight spake
221,ILLUSTRATIONS,"But ope'd the door,"
222,ILLUSTRATIONS,"And, scowling, said--""No Saxon churl shall make"
223,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Rowena wife; and dare he woo her more,"
224,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Upon him, would Sir Guy a direful vengeance wreak."""
225,ILLUSTRATIONS,
226,ILLUSTRATIONS,
227,ILLUSTRATIONS,
228,ILLUSTRATIONS,
229,ILLUSTRATIONS,Sir Harold Spurned.
230,ILLUSTRATIONS,
231,ILLUSTRATIONS,"To sue and lose, his knightly soul might bear;"
232,ILLUSTRATIONS,But insult galled him sore.
233,ILLUSTRATIONS,Should he imbrue
234,ILLUSTRATIONS,His puissant sword in her own father's gore?
235,ILLUSTRATIONS,That were to do a deed he e'er must rue;
236,ILLUSTRATIONS,Unfit it for a place in his Walhalla there.
237,ILLUSTRATIONS,
238,ILLUSTRATIONS,"No, better far to don the holy cross,"
239,ILLUSTRATIONS,As valiant knight became;
240,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Then if he fell,"
241,ILLUSTRATIONS,He would at least have saved his honoured name;
242,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Could say with life's last flitting breath--""'Tis well,"
243,ILLUSTRATIONS,"For so to live or die, to me were gain, not loss."""
244,ILLUSTRATIONS,
245,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Yet spite of all, one parting word and kiss,"
246,ILLUSTRATIONS,From dear Rowena's lips.--
247,ILLUSTRATIONS,May be the last!
248,ILLUSTRATIONS,"God knows.  That when his life felt death's eclipse,"
249,ILLUSTRATIONS,Her angel-presence would its brightness cast
250,ILLUSTRATIONS,And dissipate its gloom.  O thus to die were bliss!

252,ILLUSTRATIONS,
253,ILLUSTRATIONS,
254,ILLUSTRATIONS,
255,ILLUSTRATIONS,The Deserted Eyrie.
256,ILLUSTRATIONS,
257,ILLUSTRATIONS,"But how and where they twain could meet unseen,"
258,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Unknown!  Love found the way,"
259,ILLUSTRATIONS,"The place, the hour."
260,ILLUSTRATIONS,Rowena with her page was wont to stray
261,ILLUSTRATIONS,Along the topmost cliffs.  Here was a bower
262,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Hemmed in by rocks, where once an eagle's nest had been."
263,ILLUSTRATIONS,
264,ILLUSTRATIONS,By Eric's loyal hand a note was brought.
265,ILLUSTRATIONS,Sir Harold scarce could bear
266,ILLUSTRATIONS,To break the seal.
267,ILLUSTRATIONS,"""To-night at nine, be at the eagle's lair;"
268,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Let Eric guide.  Yours, aye, come woe, come weal."""
269,ILLUSTRATIONS,Too slowly moved the hours with love's dear issues fraught.
270,ILLUSTRATIONS,
271,ILLUSTRATIONS,"They met.  No eye but Heaven's the secrets knew,"
272,ILLUSTRATIONS,"That sad, sweet hour betrayed,"
273,ILLUSTRATIONS,Their hearts nigh burst
274,ILLUSTRATIONS,"'Twixt hope and fear.  Yet now, no more afraid"
275,ILLUSTRATIONS,"To face the world and say ""Yea, do your worst;"
276,ILLUSTRATIONS,"For aye, come weal, come woe, each will to each be true."""

282,ILLUSTRATIONS,
283,ILLUSTRATIONS,Sir Harold Wynn set sail for Holy Land
284,ILLUSTRATIONS,"With Richard, Lion-heart,"
285,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Peerless, whose fame--"
286,ILLUSTRATIONS,"There, if he might, to act a leal knight's part"
287,ILLUSTRATIONS,"And add fresh lustre to his martial name,"
288,ILLUSTRATIONS,Wherewith to move Sir Guy and gain Rowena's hand.
289,ILLUSTRATIONS,
290,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Of Saxon race, Sir Harold Wynn was fair,"
291,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Noble in mien and gait,"
292,ILLUSTRATIONS,Stalwart of frame;
293,ILLUSTRATIONS,In powers of mind and heart a worthy mate
294,ILLUSTRATIONS,For any lady.  Few beside could claim
295,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Domains so large and rich, as could with his compare."
296,ILLUSTRATIONS,
297,ILLUSTRATIONS,"The first knight's sword hung high in hall,"
298,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Had healed the feud of race,"
299,ILLUSTRATIONS,By val'rous deeds.
300,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Beneath it in the same proud resting place,"
301,ILLUSTRATIONS,"The sons fixed theirs with other warlike meeds,"
302,ILLUSTRATIONS,To prove their martial line had known nor break nor fall.

307,ILLUSTRATIONS,Rowena's Lonely Vigil.
308,ILLUSTRATIONS,
309,ILLUSTRATIONS,She sought her chamber in yon spectral keep
310,ILLUSTRATIONS,With ivy wreaths now crowned;
311,ILLUSTRATIONS,Whose casket rent
312,ILLUSTRATIONS,"By Time's grim hand and strewn by fragments round,"
313,ILLUSTRATIONS,Once held a jewel whose rare beauty lent
314,ILLUSTRATIONS,Its light to cheer the sailors toiling on the deep.
315,ILLUSTRATIONS,
316,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Her vestal lamp she nightly trimmed and fed,"
317,ILLUSTRATIONS,A beacon light more true
318,ILLUSTRATIONS,Than stars above;
319,ILLUSTRATIONS,For darkness only made the light it threw
320,ILLUSTRATIONS,"More bright--bless'd, too, as emblem of her love"
321,ILLUSTRATIONS,For those who else might make Hell's caves their last lone bed.
322,ILLUSTRATIONS,
323,ILLUSTRATIONS,"""Hist! Hist!"" They'd cry: and straight the plash of oar,"
324,ILLUSTRATIONS,And creak of sail were stilled;
325,ILLUSTRATIONS,And every ear
326,ILLUSTRATIONS,Was tent to catch the strains her sweet voice trilled.
327,ILLUSTRATIONS,Avast to gloomy thoughts and boding fear!
328,ILLUSTRATIONS,Alack the day when she should witch their hearts no more!

367,ILLUSTRATIONS,
368,ILLUSTRATIONS,"So sang Rowena, from her turret bower,"
369,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Her plaintive notes each night,"
370,ILLUSTRATIONS,In seamen's ears.
371,ILLUSTRATIONS,Their hearts sank deep.  They long had watched her white
372,ILLUSTRATIONS,And care-worn cheeks; but now they knew her fears
373,ILLUSTRATIONS,And wept with her to see the darkling storm-clouds lower.
374,ILLUSTRATIONS,
375,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Meanwhile her red-cross knight was lying prone,"
376,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Sore wounded, life nigh spent,"
377,ILLUSTRATIONS,On Acre's plains.
378,ILLUSTRATIONS,He'd swooned and woke to find him 'neath a tent.
379,ILLUSTRATIONS,With balm a maiden soothed his throbbing veins.
380,ILLUSTRATIONS,No other soul came near save she a maid unknown.
381,ILLUSTRATIONS,
382,ILLUSTRATIONS,Low whispers could he often hear without.
383,ILLUSTRATIONS,Fresh unctions were applied;
384,ILLUSTRATIONS,His wounds soon healed.
385,ILLUSTRATIONS,Whene'er he groaned swift flew she to his side:
386,ILLUSTRATIONS,At other times the maiden lay concealed.
387,ILLUSTRATIONS,At last she brought the news of Saladin's great rout.

396,ILLUSTRATIONS,At risk of life?
397,ILLUSTRATIONS,Far rather had he died than live to know
398,ILLUSTRATIONS,That precious secret was to be his wife.
399,ILLUSTRATIONS,Too well she knew that now 'twas death from him to part!
400,ILLUSTRATIONS,
401,ILLUSTRATIONS,At length the lingering weeks of healing passed
402,ILLUSTRATIONS,He e'en must quit for aye
403,ILLUSTRATIONS,Her angel tent.
404,ILLUSTRATIONS,"""Take me, Sir knight, to be your slave alway!"
405,ILLUSTRATIONS,"O leave me not, or my poor heart is rent!"""
406,ILLUSTRATIONS,"She said, and at his feet her tender form she cast."
407,ILLUSTRATIONS,
408,ILLUSTRATIONS,He bade her rise! then heard her fearful tale--
409,ILLUSTRATIONS,An orphan doomed to be
410,ILLUSTRATIONS,A lifelong slave
411,ILLUSTRATIONS,And serve a tyrant's lust and infamy.
412,ILLUSTRATIONS,"From such, Sir Harold swore he would her save,"

423,ILLUSTRATIONS,And when at last they found the stow-away
424,ILLUSTRATIONS,The hearts of all rejoiced that she was free
425,ILLUSTRATIONS,While midst the sick she moved a minist'ring sprite.
426,ILLUSTRATIONS,
427,ILLUSTRATIONS,"When, too, they heard she'd saved Sir Harold's life"
428,ILLUSTRATIONS,And why she wished to fly
429,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Her native land,"
430,ILLUSTRATIONS,"They swore, as salt tears filled each manly eye,"
431,ILLUSTRATIONS,To be her knight till safe on England's strand;
432,ILLUSTRATIONS,And happy would he be who won her then for wife!
433,ILLUSTRATIONS,
434,ILLUSTRATIONS,"On deck, one eve, she told Sir Harold, how,"
435,ILLUSTRATIONS,"She'd seen an English knight,"
436,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Sir Ralph by name,"
437,ILLUSTRATIONS,"Deal him his wound, then rush into the fight"

478,ILLUSTRATIONS,"So young, so fair, so good.  Alas! that she should die."
479,ILLUSTRATIONS,
480,ILLUSTRATIONS,But no!  It was her lady mother. She

484,ILLUSTRATIONS,"She could but pray that ere she passed away,"

486,ILLUSTRATIONS,
487,ILLUSTRATIONS,Her mother dead!  Her one true guide and friend!
488,ILLUSTRATIONS,Her heart seemed reft in twain.
489,ILLUSTRATIONS,Would she had died!
