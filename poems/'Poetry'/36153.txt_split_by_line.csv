236,_MEMORIAL DAY_,
237,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"No warrior he, a village lad,"
238,_MEMORIAL DAY_,needing nor words nor other prod
239,_MEMORIAL DAY_,To point his duty; he was glad
240,_MEMORIAL DAY_,to tread the path his fathers trod.
241,_MEMORIAL DAY_,Week days he worked in wood and field;
242,_MEMORIAL DAY_,with homely joys he decked his life;
243,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"The sword of hate he would not wield,"
244,_MEMORIAL DAY_,nor take a part in cankering strife.
245,_MEMORIAL DAY_,On Sunday in the little choir
246,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"he sang of Peace and brotherly love,"
247,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"And as his thoughts soared higher and higher,"
248,_MEMORIAL DAY_,they reached unmeasured heights above.
249,_MEMORIAL DAY_,
250,_MEMORIAL DAY_,A cry for Freedom rent the Land--
251,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"""Our Country calls, come, come, 'tis War;"
252,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"Together let us firmly stand;"""
253,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"he answered, though his heart beat sore"
254,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"At leaving home, and kin, and one"
255,_MEMORIAL DAY_,in whose fond eyes too late he read
256,_MEMORIAL DAY_,That life for her had but begun
257,_MEMORIAL DAY_,with the farewells he sadly said.
258,_MEMORIAL DAY_,
259,_MEMORIAL DAY_,A half a century has passed--
260,_MEMORIAL DAY_,and more--since all those myriads fell;
261,_MEMORIAL DAY_,For he was one of those who cast
262,_MEMORIAL DAY_,sweet life into a Battle's hell.
263,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"The village has become a town,"
264,_MEMORIAL DAY_,brick buildings the old graveyard gird;
265,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"Of him who fought not for renown,"
266,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"no one now hears a spoken word,"
267,_MEMORIAL DAY_,But on the Monument his name
268,_MEMORIAL DAY_,in gold is lettered with the rest.
269,_MEMORIAL DAY_,Without a sordid thought of fame
270,_MEMORIAL DAY_,he to his Country gave his best.
271,_MEMORIAL DAY_,
272,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"Strew flowers, then, Memorial Day"
273,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"for him, for all who for us fought."
274,_MEMORIAL DAY_,With speech and music honors pay;
275,_MEMORIAL DAY_,teach what our brave defenders taught.
276,_MEMORIAL DAY_,And now our sons are setting out;
277,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"the call for Right rings to the sky,"
278,_MEMORIAL DAY_,"""Our Country! Freedom!"" hear them shout,"
279,_MEMORIAL DAY_,re-echoing their Grandsires' cry.

294,_FLOWERS FOR BRAVE SOLDIERS_,Our hearts are bending
295,_FLOWERS FOR BRAVE SOLDIERS_,"In gratitude,"
296,_FLOWERS FOR BRAVE SOLDIERS_,While we are praying

310,_HIS MONUMENT_,
311,_HIS MONUMENT_,
312,_HIS MONUMENT_,From top to pedestal you scan it lightly--
313,_HIS MONUMENT_,Capped head to lettered base--and you are smiling.
314,_HIS MONUMENT_,What see you there to set your lips a-quiver?
315,_HIS MONUMENT_,"An awkward figure cut from ugly granite,"
316,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Aye, roughly hewn, as if unhelped by chisel,"
317,_HIS MONUMENT_,"This peaceful man of war, sculptured grotesquely."
318,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Still--there is metal in the gun he is holding,"
319,_HIS MONUMENT_,And in the cannon balls piled up before him--
320,_HIS MONUMENT_,The artist's symbols of a real soldier.
321,_HIS MONUMENT_,Yet jeer no longer!
322,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Before you is a soldier of the Union,"
323,_HIS MONUMENT_,Crowned with the tears and prayers of many mourners.
324,_HIS MONUMENT_,"The Village set him here for all to honor,"
325,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Here, in the centre of their foot-worn common,"
326,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Where on long, summer evenings boys at baseball"
327,_HIS MONUMENT_,"May gaze and gaze, and make him an example;"
328,_HIS MONUMENT_,A hero they would follow.
329,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Beholding him I see no granite figure,"
330,_HIS MONUMENT_,"But face a man who fought to save his country,"
331,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Whose heart was pierced when wife, and child and mother"
332,_HIS MONUMENT_,Clung to him closely in that tearful parting.
333,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Yet brave he marched away while flags were fluttering,"
334,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Though in his soul he knew that never, never,"
335,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Might he again see those he loved so dearly,"
336,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Nor look again upon the old white steeple,"
337,_HIS MONUMENT_,Upon the little streets and shabby buildings
338,_HIS MONUMENT_,Straggling unevenly toward the Common;
339,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Or if he came back, he'd be maimed and battered,"
340,_HIS MONUMENT_,Subject to hateful pity.
341,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Therefore I smile not at the queer, gaunt figure,"
342,_HIS MONUMENT_,"The tilted cap--the wide and baggy trousers,"
343,_HIS MONUMENT_,"The long loose overcoat, the dangling knapsack,"
344,_HIS MONUMENT_,This is the man who fought to save our country!
345,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Who, in his millions, marched from every village,"
346,_HIS MONUMENT_,From every city of our mighty Nation;
347,_HIS MONUMENT_,Who heard the drums and trumpets blithely playing--
348,_HIS MONUMENT_,"""Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching."""
349,_HIS MONUMENT_,So there it stands--thank-offering of a people--
350,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Whether of rough-hewn stone, or bronze, or marble--"
351,_HIS MONUMENT_,"Proving our debt to those who saved the Union,"
352,_HIS MONUMENT_,Pointing the way for those who'd like to follow--
353,_HIS MONUMENT_,Who to the death would fight were we in peril--
354,_HIS MONUMENT_,The Soldier's Monument!

399,_THE GRAND ARMY PASSES_,For the Republic--flags that furled and faded
400,_THE GRAND ARMY PASSES_,To their old vividness our hearts restore.
401,_THE GRAND ARMY PASSES_,"The line of veterans once firm and crowded,"
402,_THE GRAND ARMY PASSES_,"The long, long line is wavering and thin;"
