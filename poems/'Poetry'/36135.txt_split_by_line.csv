44,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,When Ixion from heaven was hurl'd
45,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"To hell, to be for ever whirl'd"
46,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"In a perpetual damning wheel,"
47,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,The pit's eternal pains to feel;
48,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"'Twas for a bestial, vulgar deed,"
49,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Whereby that mortal did succeed
50,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,In sinking Juno to the sod--
51,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Seducing e'en that beaut'ous god!
52,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Abomination foul, was this,"
53,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,To ruin lovely Juno's bliss!--
54,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"To raise in heaven domestic strife,"
55,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,'Twixt Jupiter and his lov'd wife!--
56,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"With sins that never were forgiven,"
57,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,To scandalize the court of heaven!
58,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,When Jupiter in pity took
59,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"This wretch to heaven, on earth forsook,"
60,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"He was a vile contempt'ous thing,"
61,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Despised by peasant, prince and king;"
62,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"A wand'ring vagrant, shun'd and curst,"
63,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,For sending Æneus to the dust.
64,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The aged father of his wife,"
65,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Base Ixion deprived of life!
66,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Into a pit of burning fire
67,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,He cast poor Æneus to expire!--
68,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And, while this cruel, murd'rous knave,"
69,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"For sending Æneus to his grave,"
70,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,From every circle under heaven
71,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"With scorn contemptuous, was driven,"
72,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"This wretched outcast, here forsaken,"
73,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"By Jupiter, was kindly taken"
74,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Into the realms above the skies,"
75,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,And introduced to deities!
76,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,E'en at the tables of the gods
77,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,He set this scoundrel of the clods!
78,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Such heavenly condescension should
79,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Inspire a mortal's gratitude:
80,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,In Ixion's base and blacken'd breast
81,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Some thankfulness should even rest.
82,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"His heart, though steep'd in every deed"
83,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Of darkness, in the devil's creed--"
84,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"In every sin that stains the earth,"
85,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Or blackens hell, which gave it birth,"
86,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Should now have felt a kindly glow
87,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,For what great Jupiter did do.
88,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,But Ixion did only feel
89,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,A base desire at once to steal
90,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The heart of Juno, and to tread"
91,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,On Jupiter's celestial bed!
92,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,He had an intrigue with the cloud
93,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Of Juno, which the gods allow'd;"
94,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,And thus the monstrous Centaur came
95,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,From Ixion's and Juno's shame.
96,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,But Jupiter with thunder hurl'd
97,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The villain from the heavenly world,--"
98,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Sent him to hell fore'er to feel
99,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,The ceaseless torments of the wheel.
100,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"But his vile offspring stays behind,"
101,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The bane and curse of human kind,--"
102,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Possessing still the bestial fire,"
103,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Which deep disgraced and damn'd the sire:
104,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,The same inglorious meanness strays
105,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,In the vile veins and verse and lays
106,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Of him, on crutches, devil half,"
107,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"(At whom his kindred centaurs laugh,)"
108,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,In that deformity of hell.
109,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"On whom its attributes have fell,"
110,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"In him, whose shameless, wicked life"
111,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Is with abomination rife,"
112,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Whose works, thrice damn'd and doubly dead,"
113,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The produce of conceit and lead,"
114,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Possess no other aim nor end
115,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,But foul abuse of foe and friend.
116,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"His heart, polluted with the dung"
117,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Of demons damn'd, from hell out flung,"
118,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Is rotten to the core with lies,"
119,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,From which foul slanders thickly rise.
120,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"His soul, most pitiful and mean,"
121,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Infected with hell-scorch'd gangrene,"
122,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"No kind, redeeming trait contains,"
123,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,But reeks with bestial blots and stains.
124,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"His mind, with vulgar vice imbued,"
125,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Libidinous and low and lewd,"
126,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Deep stained with malice, hate and spleen,"
127,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"With sentiments supremely mean,"
128,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Is bent on mischief, foul as hell,"
129,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,O'er which the hideous Centaurs yell.
130,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Low was his birth and low his name,"
131,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Low is his life, and low his fame;"
132,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"But lower still the depths of wo,"
133,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Where Park, when dead and damn'd, must go."
134,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Friends, foes or fiends, alike he fights,"
135,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"In all he says, or sings, or writes."
136,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"This foul defamer, crawling round"
137,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The brink of hell, to catch its sound,"
138,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Exsudes it thence, in doleful rhyme,"
139,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Debased and reeking rank with crime.
140,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"On this deformity of man,"
141,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"More monstrous than the bastard Pan,"
142,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Pegasus turn'd his nimble feet,"
143,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"As Park, on crutches, crawl'd the street;"
144,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Urging that steed, against his will,"
145,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,To bear him up Helicon's hill.
146,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"But Pegasus, a knowing horse,"
147,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Perceived that Park's conceited verse
148,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Was only suited to the stews
149,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Of hell, whence emanates his muse."
150,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"He, therefore, with Bellerophon,"
151,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Left him behind, well trampled on,"
152,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"To tune a pilfer'd, broken lyre,"
153,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"In fields of mud, and muck, and mire;"
154,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And there, his song most lowly set,"
155,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Winding through marshes, undulcet,"
156,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Contending always with the fog,"
157,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Unable e'er to flee the bog,"
158,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Does charm, perhaps, the frogs and snakes,"
159,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,And loathsome reptiles of the lakes.
160,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Although some demon's wand'ring sprite
161,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"May, haply, listen with delight,"
162,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"To Park's low, grov'ling, growling song,"
163,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"As, through the sloughs, it pours along;"
164,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And though in marshes, fens and ditches,"
165,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"It may, perhaps, amuse the witches;"
166,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Yet, should an unsuspecting team"
167,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Hear, unawares, the dismal scream"
168,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Of his lugubr'ous, muck-born verse,"
169,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,'Twould sadly frighten every horse.
170,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And, had the Children in the Wood"
171,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Just heard his strain, and understood"
172,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Its wretched, wrangling, dismal din,"
173,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,How frighten'd had those children been!--
174,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Believing soon that doom would crack,"
175,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Or that the de'il was on their track!
176,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Had Robert Kid, that pirate knave,"
177,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Heard it come creaking o'er the wave,"
178,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,He had supposed some demon's shell
179,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Was sounding from the gates of hell.
180,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The red men, savage, wild and rude,"
181,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Deep buried in their solitude,"
182,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Would wake affrighted from their dreams,"
183,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"If, haply, Park's poetic screams"
184,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Should penetrate their secret lair;
185,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And they, forthwith, would kneel in prayer"
186,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"To the great Spirit of the sun,"
187,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Believing that their days were done;
188,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"That hell's dark hole was open thrown,"
189,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And that this strain was Satan's own,"
190,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"In wrath, now prowling through the wood,"
191,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Devouring Indians for his food.
192,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Ev'n David Crockett would have run,"
193,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Affrighted, from his game and gun,"
194,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Had he but heard, in woods remote,"
195,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Park's incongruous jangling note,"
196,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Wild screeching on the western gale,"
197,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,An unpoetic dismal wail:
198,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Nor stopp'd in his despairing flight,"
199,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"In San Jacinto, e'en, to fight;"
200,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"But, rushing wildly and forlorn,"
201,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"E'en to the billows, off Cape Horn,"
202,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Most likely there, himself had drown'd,"
203,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,In terror of the doleful sound.
204,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"In western wilds, had Daniel Boon"
205,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"But heard, for once, the lecherous loon,"
206,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"He would have dropp'd his axe and gun,"
207,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And, to the eastward, rapid run;"
208,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Nor stay'd, in all his fearful flight,"
209,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"For wind or storm, through day and night,"
210,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Till he some civil spot could reach,"
211,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Uncursed by Park's dolorous screech.
212,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And had Columbus heard his roar,"
213,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"When first he landed on this shore,"
214,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"He would have turn'd his bark amain,"
215,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,And never ventured here again;
216,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Impress'd that, in this western world,"
217,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"There was, from Pandemonium hurl'd,"
218,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Some spirit damn'd for e'er to bark
219,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,The hideous songs of hideous Park.--
220,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The owls and bats that curse the land,"
221,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Could they but hear and understand
222,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,The wretched rhymes and nauseous stuff
223,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Of this conceited, vile ruff-skuff,"
224,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Would, surely, leave their secret haunts,"
225,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,And ever cease their nightly chants;
226,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Convinced that they have been, at last,"
227,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"In frightful strains, by Park surpast;"
228,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And that this vagrant of the muse,"
229,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Foul caterer for sinks and stews,--"
230,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The Five-Points' poet, has outdone"
231,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,All they have ever screech'd or sung.
232,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Despairing, thence, they would retire"
233,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Long distance from his loathsome lyre,"
234,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,And let their lonely caves and rocks
235,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Resound with his poetic shocks;
236,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"To be, perhaps, all rent in twain"
237,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"By his unearthly, rumbling strain."
238,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"As I was musing on this theme,"
239,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"I fell asleep, and had a dream:"
240,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"I saw the fish that skim the deep,"
241,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And o'er the billows nimbly leap,"
242,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"All sink beneath the boiling wave,"
243,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Down to the lowest depths, to lave:"
244,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,For they had heard the dismal lay
245,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Of Park come booming down the bay,"
246,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And, doubtless, thought some hungry shark"
247,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Was chasing them with hellish bark;
248,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"That his sharp teeth, already nigh,"
249,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Would them destroy, and they must die;"
250,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"That there, alas, was no escape"
251,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"From his terrific gab and gape,"
252,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And that their gamb'ling, watery run"
253,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Was, now, alas, for ever done!"
254,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And as they, deep in ocean's ink,"
255,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Despairing, to the bottom sink,"
256,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"O'erwhelm'd by that infernal sound,"
257,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"They cast a gloomy gaze around,"
258,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And call'd on Neptune, sea-throned god,"
259,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,To smite the rascal with his rod--
260,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"To pierce him with his trident spear,"
261,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And pitch him into hell to sear,"
262,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"To stew, and fry, in Satan's dish,"
263,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"For frightening thus, poor harmless fish."
264,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"But Neptune, monarch of the main,"
265,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"With scorn contempt'ous and disdain,"
266,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Look'd down on Park's lugubrious rhyme,"
267,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,And hasten'd o'er the boiling brine;
268,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Unheedful of the fishes' cry--
269,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And left them, with Park's songs, to die!"
270,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"His foaming horses now he lash'd,"
271,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Which, through the boisterous billows, dash'd;"
272,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Affrighted at the dismal strain,"
273,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Now wildly screeching o'er the main.
274,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The god of ocean's angry wave,"
275,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Desirous, only, now, to save"
276,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Himself from that unearthly screech,"
277,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Flew, swift, with might and main, to reach"
278,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The portals of the heavenly world,"
279,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Whence Ixion, disgraced, was hurl'd;"
280,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And there, to gods assembled, tell"
281,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"What lately, in the sea, befell"
282,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The finny tribes, that swim the deep,"
283,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Now sunk, perhaps, in endless sleep!"
284,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The hosts of heaven, when Neptune came,"
285,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"With foaming horses, from the main,"
286,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Rejoiced to see the briny king,"
287,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The golden gates, wide open, fling;"
288,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And, anxiously, all beg to know"
289,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,The tidings from the world below?
290,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Great Neptune, their celestial guest,"
291,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"With haste, thus answer'ed their request:"
292,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"""O Jove, high heaven's majestic king,"
293,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"To whom all gods due homage bring:"""
294,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"(And now the monarch of the sea,"
295,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"With awful reverence, bows the knee),"
296,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"""I come in haste, and wish to tell"
297,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"How an infernal fiend from hell,--"
298,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"An Ixion spawn,--kick'd down from heaven,"
299,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And through the earth, a vagrant, driven,"
300,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"A cast-off lyre, hath stol'n or begg'd,"
301,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Which he, with hempen strings, hath rigg'd;"
302,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And now, the ocean, creeks, and bays,"
303,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Makes, nightly, hideous, with his lays!"
304,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Last night, as I was going to bed,"
305,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,The villain struck the fish all dead!
306,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"His dismal strain, they can't abide,"
307,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"It smote their ears, and lo, they died!"
308,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"My noble steeds, affrighted, too,"
309,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Like lightning, through the billows, flew;"
310,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Nor could, the hellish note, divine,"
311,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"That creak'd, terrific, o'er the brine;"
312,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And, even, I, myself, was shock'd,"
313,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And from my chariot, nearly knock'd"
314,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Into the boisterous, boiling sea,"
315,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,By that astounding minstrelsy.
316,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And, now, by all the gods above,"
317,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"By all that men or angels love,"
318,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"I call for thunderbolts or fire,"
319,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"To dash this scoundrel and his lyre!"""
320,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Great Jupiter, with horror struck,"
321,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"In wrath, the heavenly mansion shook;"
322,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And order'd Vulcan, quick, to forge"
323,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"A thunderbolt, tremendous large,"
324,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"With which he smote the venal ghost,"
325,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"And cast him into hell, to roast!"
326,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Now, aught ---- ---- ever wrote,"
327,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Let none but fiends incarnate, quote;"
328,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"For, why should men or angels name"
329,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,What only sprites infernal claim;
330,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Or, why should men, to darkness, turn,"
331,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"A hell-curs'd villain's verse, to learn;"
332,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Or, in poetic marshes, grope,"
333,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,To save a scoundrel from the rope;--
334,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"To save from damn'd oblivion, Park,"
335,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The vilest hound of hell, to bark,"
336,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"To howl, to scream, and vilify"
337,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The rich, the poor, the low, the high;"
338,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,Who pours on virtue's hallow'd leaf
339,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,The vile pollutions of a thief;
340,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Who age, nor youth, nor beauty spares;"
341,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"But, vulture-like, voracious, tears"
342,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"The guileless maid and spotless heart,"
343,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,And stabs them with his venom'd dart!
344,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Let Satan bind, with chains of fire,"
345,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"This vain, conceited, bestial liar;"
346,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,"Whom gods, and men, and angels spurn,"
347,THE SPAWN OF IXION.,And call on hell his soul to burn!
