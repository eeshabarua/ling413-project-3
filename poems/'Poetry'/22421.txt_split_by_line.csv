41,EDITOR'S NOTE.,
42,EDITOR'S NOTE.,In this edition of Herrick quotation is for the first time facilitated
43,EDITOR'S NOTE.,by the poems being numbered according to their order in the original
44,EDITOR'S NOTE.,edition. This numbering has rendered it possible to print those
45,EDITOR'S NOTE.,"Epigrams, which successive editors have joined in deploring, in a"
46,EDITOR'S NOTE.,"detachable Appendix, their place in the original being indicated by the"
47,EDITOR'S NOTE.,numeration. It remains to be added that the footnotes in this edition
48,EDITOR'S NOTE.,"are intended to explain, as unobtrusively as possible, difficulties of"
49,EDITOR'S NOTE.,phrase or allusion which might conceivably hinder the understanding of
50,EDITOR'S NOTE.,Herrick's meaning. In the longer Notes at the end of each volume earlier
51,EDITOR'S NOTE.,versions of some important poems are printed from manuscripts at the
52,EDITOR'S NOTE.,"British Museum, and an endeavour has been made to extend the list of"
53,EDITOR'S NOTE.,"Herrick's debts to classical sources, and to identify some of his"
54,EDITOR'S NOTE.,friends who have hitherto escaped research. An editor is always apt to
55,EDITOR'S NOTE.,"mention his predecessors rather for blame than praise, and I therefore"
56,EDITOR'S NOTE.,take this opportunity of acknowledging my general indebtedness to the
57,EDITOR'S NOTE.,"pioneer work of Mr. Hazlitt and Dr. Grosart, upon whose foundations all"
58,EDITOR'S NOTE.,editors of Herrick must necessarily build.

65,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
66,PREFACE.,
67,PREFACE.,
68,PREFACE.,It is singular that the first great age of English lyric poetry should
69,PREFACE.,have been also the one great age of English dramatic poetry: but it is
70,PREFACE.,hardly less singular that the lyric school should have advanced as
71,PREFACE.,steadily as the dramatic school declined from the promise of its dawn.
72,PREFACE.,"Born with Marlowe, it rose at once with Shakespeare to heights"
73,PREFACE.,"inaccessible before and since and for ever, to sink through bright"
74,PREFACE.,gradations of glorious decline to its final and beautiful sunset in
75,PREFACE.,"Shirley: but the lyrical record that begins with the author of ""Euphues"""
76,PREFACE.,"and ""Endymion"" grows fuller if not brighter through a whole chain of"
77,PREFACE.,constellations till it culminates in the crowning star of Herrick.
78,PREFACE.,"Shakespeare's last song, the exquisite and magnificent overture to ""The"
79,PREFACE.,"Two Noble Kinsmen,"" is hardly so limpid in its flow, so liquid in its"
80,PREFACE.,"melody, as the two great songs in ""Valentinian"": but Herrick, our last"
81,PREFACE.,"poet of that incomparable age or generation, has matched them again and"
82,PREFACE.,"again. As a creative and inventive singer, he surpasses all his rivals"
83,PREFACE.,in quantity of good work; in quality of spontaneous instinct and
84,PREFACE.,"melodious inspiration he reminds us, by frequent and flawless evidence,"
85,PREFACE.,who above all others must beyond all doubt have been his first master
86,PREFACE.,"and his first model in lyric poetry--the author of ""The Passionate"
87,PREFACE.,"Shepherd to his Love""."
88,PREFACE.,
89,PREFACE.,"The last of his line, he is and will probably be always the first in"
90,PREFACE.,rank and station of English song-writers. We have only to remember how
91,PREFACE.,"rare it is to find a perfect song, good to read and good to sing,"
92,PREFACE.,combining the merits of Coleridge and Shelley with the capabilities of
93,PREFACE.,"Tommy Moore and Haynes Bayly, to appreciate the unique and"
94,PREFACE.,unapproachable excellence of Herrick. The lyrist who wished to be a
95,PREFACE.,"butterfly, the lyrist who fled or flew to a lone vale at the hour"
96,PREFACE.,"(whatever hour it may be) ""when stars are weeping,"" have left behind"
97,PREFACE.,"them such stuff as may be sung, but certainly cannot be read and endured"
98,PREFACE.,by any one with an ear for verse. The author of the Ode on France and
99,PREFACE.,the author of the Ode to the West Wind have left us hardly more than a
100,PREFACE.,"song a-piece which has been found fit for setting to music: and, lovely"
101,PREFACE.,"as they are, the fame of their authors does not mainly depend on the"
102,PREFACE.,song of Glycine or the song of which Leigh Hunt so justly and so
103,PREFACE.,critically said that Beaumont and Fletcher never wrote anything of the
104,PREFACE.,"kind more lovely. Herrick, of course, lives simply by virtue of his"
105,PREFACE.,songs; his more ambitious or pretentious lyrics are merely magnified and
106,PREFACE.,"prolonged and elaborated songs. Elegy or litany, epicede or"
107,PREFACE.,"epithalamium, his work is always a song-writer's; nothing more, but"
108,PREFACE.,"nothing less, than the work of the greatest song-writer--as surely as"
109,PREFACE.,Shakespeare is the greatest dramatist--ever born of English race. The
110,PREFACE.,"apparent or external variety of his versification is, I should suppose,"
111,PREFACE.,incomparable; but by some happy tact or instinct he was too naturally
112,PREFACE.,"unambitious to attempt, like Jonson, a flight in the wake of Pindar. He"
113,PREFACE.,knew what he could not do: a rare and invaluable gift. Born a blackbird
114,PREFACE.,"or a thrush, he did not take himself (or try) to be a nightingale."
115,PREFACE.,
116,PREFACE.,It has often been objected that he did mistake himself for a sacred
117,PREFACE.,poet: and it cannot be denied that his sacred verse at its worst is as
118,PREFACE.,offensive as his secular verse at its worst; nor can it be denied that
119,PREFACE.,no severer sentence of condemnation can be passed upon any poet's work.
120,PREFACE.,But neither Herbert nor Crashaw could have bettered such a divinely
121,PREFACE.,beautiful triplet as this:--
122,PREFACE.,
123,PREFACE.,"""We see Him come, and know Him ours,"
124,PREFACE.,Who with His sunshine and His showers
125,PREFACE.,"Turns all the patient ground to flowers""."
126,PREFACE.,
127,PREFACE.,That is worthy of Miss Rossetti herself: and praise of such work can go
128,PREFACE.,no higher.
129,PREFACE.,
130,PREFACE.,But even such exquisite touches or tones of colour may be too often
131,PREFACE.,repeated in fainter shades or more glaring notes of assiduous and facile
132,PREFACE.,reiteration. The sturdy student who tackles his Herrick as a schoolboy
133,PREFACE.,"is expected to tackle his Horace, in a spirit of pertinacious and stolid"
134,PREFACE.,"straightforwardness, will probably find himself before long so nauseated"
135,PREFACE.,"by the incessant inhalation of spices and flowers, condiments and"
136,PREFACE.,"kisses, that if a musk-rat had run over the page it could hardly be less"
137,PREFACE.,endurable to the physical than it is to the spiritual stomach. The
138,PREFACE.,fantastic and the brutal blemishes which deform and deface the
139,PREFACE.,loveliness of his incomparable genius are hardly so damaging to his fame
140,PREFACE.,as his general monotony of matter and of manner. It was doubtless in
141,PREFACE.,"order to relieve this saccharine and ""mellisonant"" monotony that he"
142,PREFACE.,thought fit to intersperse these interminable droppings of natural or
143,PREFACE.,artificial perfume with others of the rankest and most intolerable
144,PREFACE.,odour: but a diet of alternate sweetmeats and emetics is for the average
145,PREFACE.,of eaters and drinkers no less unpalatable than unwholesome. It is
146,PREFACE.,"useless and thankless to enlarge on such faults or such defects, as it"
147,PREFACE.,"would be useless and senseless to ignore. But how to enlarge, to"
148,PREFACE.,"expatiate, to insist on the charm of Herrick at his best--a charm so"
149,PREFACE.,incomparable and so inimitable that even English poetry can boast of
150,PREFACE.,nothing quite like it or worthy to be named after it--the most
151,PREFACE.,appreciative reader will be the slowest to affirm or imagine that he can
152,PREFACE.,"conjecture. This, however, he will hardly fail to remark: that Herrick,"
153,PREFACE.,"like most if not all other lyric poets, is not best known by his best"
154,PREFACE.,"work. If we may judge by frequency of quotation or of reference, the"
155,PREFACE.,"ballad of the ride from Ghent to Aix is a far more popular, more"
156,PREFACE.,generally admired and accredited specimen of Mr. Browning's work than
157,PREFACE.,"""The Last Ride Together""--and ""The Lost Leader"" than ""The Lost"
158,PREFACE.,"Mistress"". Yet the superiority of the less-popular poem is in either"
159,PREFACE.,case beyond all question or comparison: in depth and in glow of spirit
160,PREFACE.,"and of harmony, in truth and charm of thought and word, undeniable and"
161,PREFACE.,indescribable. No two men of genius were ever more unlike than the
162,PREFACE.,"authors of ""Paracelsus"" and ""Hesperides"": and yet it is as true of"
163,PREFACE.,Herrick as of Browning that his best is not always his best-known work.
164,PREFACE.,"Everyone knows the song, ""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may""; few, I"
165,PREFACE.,"fear, by comparison, know the yet sweeter and better song, ""Ye have been"
166,PREFACE.,"fresh and green"". The general monotony of style and motive which"
167,PREFACE.,fatigues and irritates his too-persevering reader is here and there
168,PREFACE.,relieved by a change of key which anticipates the note of a later and
169,PREFACE.,very different lyric school. The brilliant simplicity and pointed grace
170,PREFACE.,"of the three stanzas to Œnone (""What conscience, say, is it in thee"")"
171,PREFACE.,recall the lyrists of the Restoration in their cleanlier and happier
172,PREFACE.,"mood. And in the very fine epigram headed by the words ""Devotion makes"
173,PREFACE.,"the Deity"" he has expressed for once a really high and deep thought in"
174,PREFACE.,"words of really noble and severe propriety. His ""Mad Maid's Song,"""
175,PREFACE.,"again, can only be compared with Blake's; which has more of passionate"
176,PREFACE.,"imagination, if less of pathetic sincerity."

184,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
185,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
186,LIFE OF HERRICK.,Of the lives of many poets we know too much; of some few too little.
187,LIFE OF HERRICK.,Lovers of Herrick are almost ideally fortunate. Just such a bare outline
188,LIFE OF HERRICK.,of his life has come down to us as is sufficient to explain the
189,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"allusions in his poems, and, on the other hand, there is no temptation"
190,LIFE OF HERRICK.,to substitute chatter about his relations with Julia and Dianeme for
191,LIFE OF HERRICK.,enjoyment of his delightful verse. The recital of the bare outline need
192,LIFE OF HERRICK.,detain us but a few minutes: only the least imaginative of readers will
193,LIFE OF HERRICK.,have any difficulty in filling it in from the poems themselves.
194,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
195,LIFE OF HERRICK.,From early in the fourteenth century onwards we hear of the family of
196,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Eyrick or Herrick at Stretton, in Leicestershire. At the beginning of"
197,LIFE OF HERRICK.,the sixteenth century we find a branch of it settled in Leicester
198,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"itself, where John Eyrick, the poet's grandfather, was admitted a"
199,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"freeman in 1535, and afterwards acted as Mayor. This John's second son,"
200,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Nicholas, migrated to London, became a goldsmith in Wood Street,"
201,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Cheapside, and, according to a licence issued by the Bishop of London,"
202,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"December 8, 1582, married Julian, daughter of William Stone, sister of"
203,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Anne, wife of Sir Stephen Soame, Lord Mayor of London in 1598. The"
204,LIFE OF HERRICK.,marriage was not unfruitful. A William[A] Herrick was baptized at St.
205,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Vedast's, Foster Lane, November 24, 1585; Martha, January 22, 1586;"
206,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Mercy, December 22, 1586; Thomas, May 7, 1588; Nicholas, April 22, 1589;"
207,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Anne, July 26, 1590; and Robert himself, August 24, 1591."
208,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
209,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"[A] A second William is said to have been born, posthumously, in ""Harry"
210,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Campion's house at Hampton,"" in 1593."
211,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
212,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Fifteen months after the poet's birth, on November 7, 1592, Nicholas"
213,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Herrick made his will, estimating his property as worth £3000, and"
214,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"devising it, as to one-third to his wife, and as to the other two-thirds"
215,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"to his children in equal shares. In the will he described himself as ""of"
216,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"perfect memorye in sowle, but sicke in bodye"". Two days after its"
217,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"execution he was buried, having died, not from disease, but from a fall"
218,LIFE OF HERRICK.,from an upper window. His death had so much the appearance of
219,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"self-destruction that £220 had to be paid to the High Almoner, Dr."
220,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Fletcher, Bishop of Bristol, in satisfaction of his official claim to"
221,LIFE OF HERRICK.,the goods and chattels of suicides. Herrick's biographers have not
222,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"failed to vituperate the Bishop for his avarice, but dues allowed by law"
223,LIFE OF HERRICK.,are hardly to be abandoned because a baby of fifteen months is destined
224,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"to become a brilliant poet, and no other exceptional circumstances are"
225,LIFE OF HERRICK.,alleged. The estate of Nicholas Herrick could the better afford the fine
226,LIFE OF HERRICK.,inasmuch as it realized £2000 more than was expected.
227,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
228,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"By the will Robert and William Herrick were appointed ""overseers,"" or"
229,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"trustees for the children. The former was the poet's godfather, and in"
230,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"his will of 1617 left him £5. To William Herrick, then recently knighted"
231,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"for his services as goldsmith, jeweller, and moneylender to James I.,"
232,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"the young Robert was apprenticed for ten years, September 25, 1607. An"
233,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"allusion to ""beloved Westminster,"" in his _Tears to Thamesis_, has been"
234,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"taken to refer to Westminster school, and alleged as proof that he was"
235,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"educated there. Dr. Grosart even presses the mention of Richmond,"
236,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Kingston, and Hampton Court to support a conjecture that Herrick may"
237,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"have travelled up and down to school from Hampton. If so, one wonders"
238,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"what his headmaster had to say to the ""soft-smooth virgins, for our"
239,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"chaste disport"" by whom he was accompanied. But the references in the"
240,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"poem are surely to his courtier-life in London, and after his father's"
241,LIFE OF HERRICK.,death the apprenticeship to his uncle in 1607 is the first fact in his
242,LIFE OF HERRICK.,life of which we can be sure.
243,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
244,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"In 1607, Herrick was fifteen, and, even if we conjecture that he may"
245,LIFE OF HERRICK.,have been allowed to remain at school some little time after his
246,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"apprenticeship nominally began, he must have served his uncle for five"
247,LIFE OF HERRICK.,or six years. Sir William had himself been bound apprentice in a similar
248,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"way to the poet's father, and we have no evidence that he exacted any"
249,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"premium. At any rate, when in 1614, his nephew, then of age, desired to"
250,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"leave the business and go to Cambridge, the ten years' apprenticeship"
251,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"did not stand in his way, and he entered as a Fellow Commoner at St."
252,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"John's. His uncle plainly still managed his affairs, for an amusing"
253,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"series of fourteen letters has been preserved at Beaumanor, until lately"
254,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"the seat of Sir William's descendants, in which the poet asks sometimes"
255,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"for payment of a quarterly stipend of £10, sometimes for a formal loan,"
256,LIFE OF HERRICK.,sometimes for the help of his avuncular Mæcenas. It seems a fair
257,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"inference from this variety of requests that, since Herrick's share of"
258,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"his father's property could hardly have yielded a yearly income of £40,"
259,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"he was allowed to draw on his capital for this sum, but that his uncle"
260,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"and Lady Herrick occasionally made him small presents, which may account"
261,LIFE OF HERRICK.,for his tone of dependence.
262,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
263,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"The quarterly stipend was paid through various booksellers, but"
264,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"irregularly, so that the poor poet was frequently reduced to great"
265,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"straits, though £40 a-year (£200 of our money) was no bad allowance."
266,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"After two years he migrated from St. John's to Trinity Hall, to study"
267,LIFE OF HERRICK.,law and curtail his expenses. He took his Bachelor's degree from there
268,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"in January, 1617, and his Master's in 1620. The fourteen letters show"
269,LIFE OF HERRICK.,that he had prepared himself for University life by cultivating a very
270,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"florid prose style which frequently runs into decasyllabics, perhaps a"
271,LIFE OF HERRICK.,result of a study of the dramatists. Sir William Herrick is sometimes
272,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"addressed in them as his most ""careful"" uncle, but at the time of his"
273,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"migration the poet speaks of his ""ebbing estate,"" and as late as 1629 he"
274,LIFE OF HERRICK.,was still £10 16s. 9d. in debt to the College Steward. We can thus
275,LIFE OF HERRICK.,hardly imagine that he was possessed of any considerable private income
276,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"when he returned to London, to live practically on his wits, and a study"
277,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"of his poems suggests that, the influence of the careful uncle removed,"
278,LIFE OF HERRICK.,whatever capital he possessed was soon likely to vanish.[B] His verses
279,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"to the Earl of Pembroke, to Endymion Porter and to others, show that he"
280,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"was glad of ""pay"" as well as ""praise,"" but the system of patronage"
281,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"brought no discredit with it, and though the absence of any poetical"
282,LIFE OF HERRICK.,mention of his uncle suggests that the rich goldsmith was not
283,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"well-pleased with his nephew, with the rest of his well-to-do relations"
284,LIFE OF HERRICK.,Herrick seems to have remained on excellent terms.
285,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
286,LIFE OF HERRICK.,[B] Yet in his _Farewell to Poetry_ he distinctly says:--
287,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
288,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"""I've more to bear my charge than way to go"";"
289,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
290,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"the line, however, is a translation from his favourite Seneca, Ep. 77."
291,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
292,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Besides patrons, such as Pembroke, Westmoreland, Newark, Buckingham,"
293,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Herrick had less distinguished friends at Court, Edward Norgate, Jack"
294,LIFE OF HERRICK.,Crofts and others. He composed the words for two New Year anthems which
295,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"were set to music by Henry Lawes, and he was probably personally known"
296,LIFE OF HERRICK.,both to the King and Queen. Outside the Court he reckoned himself one of
297,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Ben Jonson's disciples, ""Sons of Ben"" as they were called, had friends"
298,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"at the Inns of Court, knew the organist of Westminster Abbey and his"
299,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"pretty daughters, and had every temptation to live an amusing and"
300,LIFE OF HERRICK.,expensive life. His poems were handed about in manuscript after the
301,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"fashion of the time, and wherever music and poetry were loved he was"
302,LIFE OF HERRICK.,sure to be a welcome guest.
303,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
304,LIFE OF HERRICK.,Mr. Hazlitt's conjecture that Herrick at this time may have held some
305,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"small post in the Chapel at Whitehall is not unreasonable, but at what"
306,LIFE OF HERRICK.,date he took Holy Orders is not known. In 1627 he obtained the post of
307,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"chaplain to the unlucky expedition to the Isle of Rhé, and two years"
308,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"later (September 30, 1629) he was presented by the King to the Vicarage"
309,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"of Dean Prior, in Devonshire, which the promotion of its previous"
310,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"incumbent, Dr. Potter, to the Bishopric of Carlisle, had left in the"
311,LIFE OF HERRICK.,royal gift. The annual value of the living was only £50 (£250 present
312,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"value), no great prize, but the poem entitled _Mr. Robert Hericke: his"
313,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"farwell unto Poetrie_ (not printed in _Hesperides_, but extant in more"
314,LIFE OF HERRICK.,than one manuscript version) shows that the poet was not unaware of the
315,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"responsibilities of his profession. ""But unto me,"" he says to his Muse:"
316,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
317,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"""But unto me be only hoarse, since now"
318,LIFE OF HERRICK.,(Heaven and my soul bear record of my vow)
319,LIFE OF HERRICK.,I my desires screw from thee and direct
320,LIFE OF HERRICK.,Them and my thoughts to that sublime respect
321,LIFE OF HERRICK.,And conscience unto priesthood. 'Tis not need
322,LIFE OF HERRICK.,(The scarecrow unto mankind) that doth breed
323,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Wiser conclusions in me, since I know"
324,LIFE OF HERRICK.,I've more to bear my charge than way to go;
325,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Or had I not, I'd stop the spreading itch"
326,LIFE OF HERRICK.,Of craving more: so in conceit be rich;
327,LIFE OF HERRICK.,But 'tis the God of nature who intends
328,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"And shapes my function for more glorious ends."""
329,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
330,LIFE OF HERRICK.,Perhaps it was at this time too that Herrick wrote his _Farewell to
331,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Sack_, and although he returned both to sack and to poetry we should be"
332,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"wrong in imagining him as a ""blind mouth,"" using his office merely as a"
333,LIFE OF HERRICK.,means of gain. He celebrated the births of Charles II and his brother in
334,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"verse, perhaps with an eye to future royal favours, but no more than"
335,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Chaucer's good parson does he seem to have ""run to London unto Seynte"
336,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Poules"" in search of the seventeenth century equivalent for a chauntry,"
337,LIFE OF HERRICK.,and many of his poems show him living the life of a contented country
338,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"clergyman, sharing the contents of bin and cruse with his poor"
339,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"parishioners, and jotting down sermon-notes in verse."
340,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
341,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"The great majority of Herrick's poems cannot be dated, and it is idle to"
342,LIFE OF HERRICK.,enquire which were written before his ordination and which afterwards.
343,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"His conception of religion was medieval in its sensuousness, and he"
344,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"probably repeated the stages of sin, repentance and renewed assurance"
345,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"with some facility. He lived with an old servant, Prudence Baldwin, the"
346,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"""Prew"" of many of his poems; kept a spaniel named Tracy, and, so says"
347,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"tradition, a tame pig. When his parishioners annoyed him he seems to"
348,LIFE OF HERRICK.,have comforted himself with epigrams on them; when they slumbered during
349,LIFE OF HERRICK.,one of his sermons the manuscript was suddenly hurled at them with a
350,LIFE OF HERRICK.,curse for their inattention.
351,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
352,LIFE OF HERRICK.,In the same year that Herrick was appointed to his country vicarage his
353,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"mother died while living with her daughter, Mercy, the poet's dearest"
354,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"sister (see 818), then for some time married to John Wingfield of"
355,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Brantham in Suffolk (see 590), by whom she had three sons and a"
356,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"daughter, also called Mercy. His eldest brother, Thomas, had been placed"
357,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"with a Mr. Massam, a merchant, but as early as 1610 had retired to live"
358,LIFE OF HERRICK.,a country life in Leicestershire (see 106). He appears to have married a
359,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"wife named Elizabeth, whose loss Herrick laments (see 72). Nicholas, the"
360,LIFE OF HERRICK.,next brother was more adventurous. He had become a merchant trading to
361,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"the Levant, and in this capacity had visited the Holy Land (see 1100)."
362,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"To his wife Susanna, daughter of William Salter, Herrick addresses two"
363,LIFE OF HERRICK.,poems (522 and 977). There were three sons and four daughters in this
364,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"family, and Herrick wrote a poem to one of the daughters, Bridget (562),"
365,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"and an elegy on another, Elizabeth (376). When Mrs. Herrick died the"
366,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"bulk of her property was left to the Wingfields, but William Herrick"
367,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"received a legacy of £100, with ten pounds apiece to his two children,"
368,LIFE OF HERRICK.,and a ring of twenty shillings to his wife. Nicholas and Robert were
369,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"only left twenty-shilling rings, and the administration of the will was"
370,LIFE OF HERRICK.,entrusted to William Herrick and the Wingfields. The will may have been
371,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"the result of a family arrangement, and we have no reason to believe"
372,LIFE OF HERRICK.,that the unequal division gave rise to any ill-feeling. Herrick's
373,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"address to ""his dying brother, Master William Herrick"" (186), shows"
374,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"abundant affection, and there is every reason to believe that it was"
375,LIFE OF HERRICK.,addressed to the William who administered to Mrs. Herrick's will.
376,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
377,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"While little nephews and nieces were springing up around him, Herrick"
378,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"remained unmarried, and frequently congratulates himself on his freedom"
379,LIFE OF HERRICK.,from the yoke matrimonial. He imagined how he would bid farewell to his
380,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"wife, if he had one (465), and wrote magnificent epithalamia for his"
381,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"friends, but lived and died a bachelor. When first civil troubles and"
382,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"then civil war cast a shadow over the land, it is not very easy to say"
383,LIFE OF HERRICK.,how he viewed the contending parties. He was devoted to Charles and
384,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Henrietta Maria and the young Prince of Wales, and rejoiced at every"
385,LIFE OF HERRICK.,Royalist success. Many also of his poems breathe the spirit of
386,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"unquestioning loyalty, but in others he is less certain of kingly"
387,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"wisdom. Something, however, must be allowed for his evident habit of"
388,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"versifying any phrase or epigram which impressed him, and not all his"
389,LIFE OF HERRICK.,poems need be regarded as expressions of his personal opinions. But with
390,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"whatever doubts his loyalty was qualified, it was sufficiently obvious"
391,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"to procure his ejection from his living in 1648; and, making the best of"
392,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"his loss, he bade farewell to Dean Prior, shook the dust of ""loathed"
393,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Devonshire"" off his feet, and returned gaily to London, where he appears"
394,LIFE OF HERRICK.,to have discarded his clerical habit and to have been made abundantly
395,LIFE OF HERRICK.,welcome by his friends.
396,LIFE OF HERRICK.,
397,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Free from the cares of his incumbency, and free also from the restraints"
398,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"it imposed, Herrick's thoughts turned to the publication of his poems."
399,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"As we have said, in his old Court-days these had found some circulation"
400,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"in manuscript, and in 1635 one of his fairy poems was printed, probably"
401,LIFE OF HERRICK.,without his leave (see Appendix). In 1639 his poem (575) _The Apparition
402,LIFE OF HERRICK.,of his Mistress calling him to Elysium_ was licensed at Stationers' Hall
403,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"under the title of _His Mistress' Shade_, and it was included the next"
404,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"year in an edition of Shakespeare's Poems (see Notes). On April 29,"
405,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"1640, ""The severall poems written by Master Robert Herrick,"" were"
406,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"entered as to be published by Andrew Crook, but no trace of such a"
407,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"volume has been discovered, and it was only in 1648 that _Hesperides_ at"
408,LIFE OF HERRICK.,length appeared. Two years later upwards of eighty of the poems in it
409,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"were printed in the 1650 edition of _Witt's Recreations_, but a small"
410,LIFE OF HERRICK.,number of these show considerable variations from the _Hesperides_
411,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"versions, and it is probable that they were printed from the poet's"
412,LIFE OF HERRICK.,manuscript. Compilers of other miscellanies and song books laid Herrick
413,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"under contribution, but, with the one exception of his contribution to"
414,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"the _Lacrymæ Musarum_ in 1649, no fresh production of his pen has been"
415,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"preserved, and we know nothing further of his life save that he returned"
416,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"to Dean Prior after the Restoration (August 24, 1662), and that"
417,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"according to the parish register ""Robert Herrick, Vicker, was buried"
418,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"y^e 15th day October, 1674."""

9348,NOTES.,"his accession became groom of his bedchamber, was active in the king's"

9568,NOTES.,"the king's service at Oxford, _i.e._, between 1642 and 1646, and it has"
9569,NOTES.,been taken for granted that this ode refers to his death. The
9570,NOTES.,"supposition is possibly right, but if so, the ode, despite its beauty,"
9571,NOTES.,is so gratingly and extraordinarily selfish that we may wonder if the
9572,NOTES.,dead brother is not the William Herrick of the next poem. The first
9573,NOTES.,"verse is, of course, a soliloquy of Herrick's, not, as Dr. Grosart"

9578,NOTES.,"Grosart and Mr. Hazlitt the poet had an elder brother, William,"
9579,NOTES.,"baptized at St. Vedast's, Foster Lane, Nov. 24, 1585 (he must have been"

9581,NOTES.,"was baptized in the following January), and alive in 1629, when he acted"
9582,NOTES.,"as one of the executors of his mother's will. But, it is said, there was"
9583,NOTES.,"also another brother named William, born in 1593, after his father's"
9584,NOTES.,"death, ""at Harry Campion's house at Hampton"". I have not been able to"
9585,NOTES.,"find the authority for this last statement, which, as it asserts the"

9603,NOTES.,"in all important points. We may conclude, therefore, that they represent"
9604,NOTES.,"an earlier version of the poem, subsequently revised by Herrick before"

10247,--R. HERRICK.,several are of great beauty. There are few happier images in Herrick
10248,--R. HERRICK.,than that of _Time throned in a saffron evening_ in stanza 11. It is
10249,--R. HERRICK.,only when the earlier version is read as a whole that Herrick's taste
10250,--R. HERRICK.,"in omitting is vindicated. Each stanza is good in itself, but in the"
10251,--R. HERRICK.,"MSS. the poem drags from excessive length, and the reduction of its"

10348,--R. HERRICK.,
10349,--R. HERRICK.,"Son to Robert Norgate, D.D., Master of Bene't College, Cambridge. He was"
10350,--R. HERRICK.,"employed by the Earl of Arundel to purchase pictures, and on one"
10351,--R. HERRICK.,"occasion found himself at Marseilles without remittances, and had to"
10352,--R. HERRICK.,tramp through France on foot. According to the Calendars of State Papers
10353,--R. HERRICK.,"in 1625, it was ordered that, ""forasmuch as his Majesty's letters to the"
10354,--R. HERRICK.,"Grand Signior, the King of Persia, the Emperor of Russia, the Great"
10355,--R. HERRICK.,"Mogul, and other remote Princes, had been written, limned, and garnished"
10356,--R. HERRICK.,"with gold and colours by scriveners abroad, thenceforth they should be"
10357,--R. HERRICK.,"so written, limned, and garnished by Edward Norgate, Clerk of the Signet"
10358,--R. HERRICK.,"in reversion"". Six years later this order was renewed, the ""Kings of"
10359,--R. HERRICK.,"Bantam, Macassar, Barbary, Siam, Achine, Fez, and Sus"" being added to"
10360,--R. HERRICK.,"the previous list, and Norgate being now designated as a Clerk of the"
10361,--R. HERRICK.,"Signet Extraordinary. In the same year, having previously been"
10362,--R. HERRICK.,"Bluemantle Pursuivant, he was promoted to be Windsor Herald, in which"
10363,--R. HERRICK.,"capacity he received numerous fees during the next few years, and was"
10364,--R. HERRICK.,"excused ship money. He still, however, retained his clerkship, for he"
10365,--R. HERRICK.,"writes in 1639: ""The poor Office of Arms is fain to blazon the Council"
10366,--R. HERRICK.,"books and Signet"". The phrase occurs in a series of nineteen letters of"
10367,--R. HERRICK.,"extraordinary interest, which Norgate wrote from the North, chiefly to"
10368,--R. HERRICK.,"his friend, Robert Reade, secretary to Windebank, on the course of"
10369,--R. HERRICK.,"affairs. In Sept., 1641, ""Ned Norgate"" was ordered personally to attend"
10370,--R. HERRICK.,"the king. ""It is his Majesty's pleasure that the master should wait and"
10371,--R. HERRICK.,"not the men, and _that_ they shall find."" Henceforth I find no certain"
10372,--R. HERRICK.,reference to him; according to Fuller he died at the Herald's Office in
10373,--R. HERRICK.,1649. It would be interesting if we could be sure that this Edward
10374,--R. HERRICK.,Norgate is the same as the one who in 1611 was appointed Tuner of his
10375,--R. HERRICK.,"Majesty's ""virginals, organs, and other instruments,"" and in 1637"
10376,--R. HERRICK.,received a grant of £140 for the repair of the organ at Hampton Court.

10383,--R. HERRICK.,"thinks, ii. 135) to the old custom of reading part of the marriage"
10384,--R. HERRICK.,"service at the church door or porch (cp. Chaucer: ""Husbands at churchë"
10385,--R. HERRICK.,"door she had had five""). The porch of the house is meant, and the"
10386,--R. HERRICK.,allusions are to the ceremonies at the threshold (cp. the Southwell
10387,--R. HERRICK.,Epithalamium). Dr. Grosart quotes from the Dean Prior register the entry
10388,--R. HERRICK.,"of the marriage of Henry Northleigh, gentleman, and Mistress Lettice"

10392,--R. HERRICK.,"edition of the _Diary of Walter Yonge_, p. 70 (kindly shown me by the"
10393,--R. HERRICK.,"Rev. J. H. Ward), we have a contemporary account of the Club known as"
10394,--R. HERRICK.,"the Tityre Tues, which took its name from the first words of Virgil's"
10395,--R. HERRICK.,"first _Eclogue_. ""The beginning of December, 1623, there was a great"
10396,--R. HERRICK.,"number in London, haunting taverns and other debauched places, who swore"
10397,--R. HERRICK.,themselves in a brotherhood and named themselves _Tityre Tues_. The oath
10398,--R. HERRICK.,they gave in this manner: he that was to be sworn did put his dagger
10399,--R. HERRICK.,"into a pottle of wine, and held his hand upon the pommel thereof, and"
10400,--R. HERRICK.,then was to make oath that he would aid and assist all other of his
10401,--R. HERRICK.,"fellowship and not disclose their council. There were divers knights,"
10402,--R. HERRICK.,"some young noblemen and gentlemen of this brotherhood, and they were to"
10403,--R. HERRICK.,"know one the other by a black bugle which they wore, and their followers"
10404,--R. HERRICK.,to be known by a blue ribbond. There are discovered of them about 80 or
10405,--R. HERRICK.,"100 persons, and have been examined by the Privy Council, but nothing"
10406,--R. HERRICK.,discovered of any intent they had. It is said that the king hath given
10407,--R. HERRICK.,"commandment that they shall be re-examined."" In Mennis's _Musarum"
10408,--R. HERRICK.,"Deliciæ_ the brotherhood is celebrated in a poem headed ""The Tytre Tues;"
10409,--R. HERRICK.,"or, a Mocke Song. To the tune of Chive Chase. By Mr. George Chambers."""
10410,--R. HERRICK.,The second verse runs:--
10411,--R. HERRICK.,
10412,--R. HERRICK.,"""They call themselves the Tytere-tues,"
10413,--R. HERRICK.,And wore a blue rib-bin;
10414,--R. HERRICK.,And when a-drie would not refuse
10415,--R. HERRICK.,To drink. O fearful sin!
10416,--R. HERRICK.,
10417,--R. HERRICK.,"""The council, which is thought most wise,"
10418,--R. HERRICK.,"Did sit so long upon it,"
10419,--R. HERRICK.,"That they grew weary and did rise,"
10420,--R. HERRICK.,"And could make nothing on it."""
10421,--R. HERRICK.,
10422,--R. HERRICK.,"According to a letter of Chamberlain to Carleton, indexed among the"
10423,--R. HERRICK.,"_State Papers_, the Tityres were a secret society first formed in Lord"
10424,--R. HERRICK.,"Vaux's regiment in the Low Countries, and their ""prince"" was called"
10425,--R. HERRICK.,"Ottoman. Another entry shows that the ""Bugle"" mentioned by Yonge was the"
10426,--R. HERRICK.,"badge of a society originally distinct from the Tityres, which"
10427,--R. HERRICK.,afterwards joined with it. The date of Herrick's poem is thus fixed as
10428,--R. HERRICK.,"December, 1623/4, and this is confirmed by another sentence in the same"

10433,--R. HERRICK.,"January, 1624, to meet on February 12. Sir Simeon Steward, to whom the"
10434,--R. HERRICK.,"poem is addressed, was of the family of the Stewards of Stantney, in the"
10435,--R. HERRICK.,"Isle of Ely. He was knighted with his father, Mark Steward, in 1603, and"
10436,--R. HERRICK.,"afterwards became a fellow-commoner of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He was"
10437,--R. HERRICK.,"at different times Sheriff and Deputy-Lieutenant for Cambridgeshire, and"
10438,--R. HERRICK.,while serving in the latter capacity got into some trouble for unlawful
10439,--R. HERRICK.,exactions. In 1627 he wrote a poem on the _King of the Fairies Clothes_
10440,--R. HERRICK.,in the same vein as Herrick's fairy pieces.

10839,--R. HERRICK.,"451. _To the right gracious Prince, Lodowick, Duke of Richmond and"
10840,--R. HERRICK.,Lennox._ There appears to me to be a blunder here which Dr. Grosart and
10841,--R. HERRICK.,"Mr. Hazlitt do not elucidate, by recording the birth of Lodowick, first"
10842,--R. HERRICK.,"Duke of Richmond, in 1574, his succession to the Lennox title in 1583,"
10843,--R. HERRICK.,"creation as Duke of Richmond in May, 1623, and death in the following"
10844,--R. HERRICK.,"February. For this first duke was no ""stem"" left ""of all those three"
10845,--R. HERRICK.,"brave brothers fallen in the war,"" and the allusion here is undoubtedly"
10846,--R. HERRICK.,"to his nephews--George, Lord d'Aubigny, who fell at Edgehill; Lord John"
10847,--R. HERRICK.,"Stewart, who fell at Alresford; and Lord Bernard Stewart (Earl of"
10848,--R. HERRICK.,"Lichfield), who fell at Rowton Heath. In elucidation of Herrick's Dirge"
10849,--R. HERRICK.,"(219) over the last of these three brothers, I have already quoted"
10850,--R. HERRICK.,"Clarendon's remark, that he was ""the third brother of that illustrious"
10851,--R. HERRICK.,"family that sacrificed his life in this quarrel,"" and it cannot be"
10852,--R. HERRICK.,doubted that Herrick is here alluding to the same fact. The poem must
10853,--R. HERRICK.,"therefore have been written after 1645, _i.e._, more than twenty years"
10854,--R. HERRICK.,"after the death of Duke Lodowick. But the duke then living was James,"
10855,--R. HERRICK.,"who succeeded his father Esme in 1624, was recreated Duke of Richmond in"
10856,--R. HERRICK.,"1641, and did not die till 1655. It is true that there was a brother"
10857,--R. HERRICK.,"named Lodovic, but he was an abbot in France and never succeeded to the"
10858,--R. HERRICK.,"title. Herrick, therefore, seems to have blundered in the Christian"
10859,--R. HERRICK.,name.

10861,--R. HERRICK.,"453. _Let's live in haste._ From Martial, VII. xlvii. 11, 12:--"

10877,--R. HERRICK.,
10878,--R. HERRICK.,465. _The parting Verse or charge to his Supposed Wife when he
10879,--R. HERRICK.,travelled._ MS. variants of this poem are found at the British Museum in
10880,--R. HERRICK.,"Add. 22, 603, and in Ashmole MS. 38. Their title, ""Mr. Herrick's charge"
10881,--R. HERRICK.,"to his wife,"" led Mr. Payne Collier to rashly identify with the poet a"
10882,--R. HERRICK.,"certain Robert Herrick married at St. Clement Danes, 1632, to a Jane"
10883,--R. HERRICK.,"Gibbons. The variants are numerous, but not very important. In l. 4 we"
10884,--R. HERRICK.,"have ""draw wooers"" for ""draw thousands""; ll. 11-16 are transposed to"
10885,--R. HERRICK.,"after l. 28; and ""Are the expressions of that itch"" is written ""As"
10886,--R. HERRICK.,"emblems will express that itch""; ll. 27, 28 appear as:--"
10887,--R. HERRICK.,
10888,--R. HERRICK.,"""For that once lost thou _needst must fall"
10889,--R. HERRICK.,"To one, then prostitute to all:_"
10890,--R. HERRICK.,
10891,--R. HERRICK.,And we then have the transposed passage:--
10892,--R. HERRICK.,
10893,--R. HERRICK.,Nor so immurèd would I have
10894,--R. HERRICK.,"Thee live, as dead, _or_ in thy grave;"
10895,--R. HERRICK.,"But walk abroad, yet wisely well"
10896,--R. HERRICK.,_Keep 'gainst_ my coming sentinel.

10898,--R. HERRICK.,"Thy thoughts to say, I back am come._"
10899,--R. HERRICK.,
10900,--R. HERRICK.,Farther on we have the rather pretty variant:--
10901,--R. HERRICK.,
10902,--R. HERRICK.,"""Let them _call thee wondrous fair,"
10903,--R. HERRICK.,"Crown of women_, yet despair""."
10904,--R. HERRICK.,
10905,--R. HERRICK.,"Eight lines lower ""virtuous"" is read for ""gentle,"" and the omission of"
10906,--R. HERRICK.,some small words throws some light on a change in Herrick's metrical
10907,--R. HERRICK.,views as he grew older. The words omitted are bracketed:--
10908,--R. HERRICK.,
10909,--R. HERRICK.,"""[And] Let thy dreams be only fed"
10910,--R. HERRICK.,"With this, that I am in thy bed."

10915,--R. HERRICK.,"_'Gainst thee and_ force a passage in,"" etc."
10916,--R. HERRICK.,
10917,--R. HERRICK.,"Other variants are: ""Creates the action"" for ""That makes the action"";"
10918,--R. HERRICK.,"""Glory"" for ""Triumph""; ""my last signet"" for ""this compression""; ""turn"
10919,--R. HERRICK.,"again in my full triumph"" for ""come again, As one triumphant,"" and ""the"

10936,--R. HERRICK.,"Hacket: ""Smell sweet, O ye flowers, in your native sweetness: be not"
10937,--R. HERRICK.,"gilded with the idle art of man"". The use of gloves at weddings forms"
10938,--R. HERRICK.,the subject of another section in Brand (ii. 125). He quotes Ben
10939,--R. HERRICK.,"Jonson's _Silent Woman_; ""We see no ensigns of a wedding here, no"
10940,--R. HERRICK.,"character of a bridal; where be our scarves and our gloves?"""

10942,--R. HERRICK.,"483. _To his worthy friend, M. Thomas Falconbrige._ As Herrick hints at"
10943,--R. HERRICK.,"his friend's destiny for a public career, it seemed worth while to hunt"
10944,--R. HERRICK.,through the Calendar of State Papers for a chance reference to this
10945,--R. HERRICK.,"Falconbridge, who so far has evaded editors. He is apparently the Mr."
10946,--R. HERRICK.,"Thomas Falconbridge who appears in various papers between 1640 and 1644,"

10968,--R. HERRICK.,in 1660.
10969,--R. HERRICK.,
10970,--R. HERRICK.,_To this white temple of my heroes._ Ben Jonson's admirers were proud to
10971,--R. HERRICK.,"call themselves ""sealed of the tribe of Ben,"" and Herrick, a devout"
10972,--R. HERRICK.,"Jonsonite, seems to have imitated the idea so far as to plan sometimes,"
10973,--R. HERRICK.,"as here, a Temple, sometimes a Book (see _infra_, 510), sometimes a City"
10974,--R. HERRICK.,"(365), a Plantation (392), a Calendar (545), a College (983), of his own"
10975,--R. HERRICK.,"favourite friends, to whom his poetry was to give immortality. The"
10976,--R. HERRICK.,"earliest direct reference to this plan is in his address to John Selden,"
10977,--R. HERRICK.,"the antiquary (365), in which he writes:--"
10978,--R. HERRICK.,
10979,--R. HERRICK.,"""A city here of heroes I have made"

10982,--R. HERRICK.,"Live thou a Selden, that's a demi-god""."
10983,--R. HERRICK.,
10984,--R. HERRICK.,It is noteworthy that the poems which contain the clearest reference to
10985,--R. HERRICK.,"this Temple (or its variants) are mostly addressed to kinsfolk, _e.g._,"

11005,--R. HERRICK.,"master of the choristers at Westminster Abbey, where he was buried in"

21434,NOTES.,"and the last six hundred as for the most part later, and I must add,"
21435,NOTES.,inferior work. This is borne out by the absence of any manuscript
21436,NOTES.,versions of poems in the second half of the book. Herrick's verses would

22269,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,
22270,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,
22271,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,Herrick's name has been so persistently connected with _Poor Robert's
22272,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"Almanack_ that a few words must be said on the subject. There is, we are"
22273,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"told, a Devonshire tradition ascribing the _Almanack_ to him, and this"
22274,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"is accepted by Nichols in his _Leicestershire_, and ""accredited"" by Dr."
22275,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,Grosart. The tradition apparently rests on no better basis than
22276,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"Herrick's Christian name, and of the poems in the issues of the"
22277,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"_Almanack_ which I have seen, it may be said, that, while the worst of"
22278,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"them, save for some lack of neatness of turn, might conceivably have"
22279,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,been by Herrick--on the principle that if Herrick could write some of
22280,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"his epigrams, he could write anything--the more ambitious poems it is"
22281,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,quite impossible to attribute to the author of the _Hesperides_. But
22282,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"apart from opinion, the negative evidence is overwhelming. Of the three"
22283,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"earliest issues in the British Museum, 1664, 1667 and 1669 (all in the"
22284,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"annual collections of Almanacs, issued by the Stationers' Company, and"
22285,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"all, it may be noted, bound for Charles II.), I transcribe the"
22286,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"title-page of the first. ""Poor Robin. 1664. An Almanack After a New"
22287,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,Fashion wherein the Reader may see (if he be not blinde) many remarkable
22288,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"things worthy of Observation. Containing a two-fold Kalendar, viz. the"

22294,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"the Company of Stationers."""
22295,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,
22296,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"In the 1667 issue the paragraph about the Pole runs: ""Where the"
22297,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,Maypole is elevated (with a plumm cake on the top of it) 5 yards ¾ above
22298,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"the Market Cross"". The mention of Saffron Walden had apparently been"
22299,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"ridiculed, and the author in this year joins in the laugh, and in 1669"
22300,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,omits the paragraph altogether. But what had Herrick at any time to do
22301,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"with Saffron Walden, and why should the poet, whose politics, apart from"
22302,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"some personal devotion to Charles I., were distinctly moderate, mix"
22303,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"himself up with an ultra-Cavalier publication? Also, if Herrick be ""Poor"
22304,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"Robin"" we must attribute to him, at least, the greater part of the"
22305,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"twenty-one ""Poor Robin"" publications, of which Mr. H. Ecroyd Smith gave"
22306,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"a list in _Notes and Queries_, 6th series, vii. 321-3, _e.g._, ""Poor"
22307,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"Robin's Perambulation from the Town of Saffron Walden to London"" (1678),"
22308,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"""The Merrie Exploits of Poor Robin, the Merrie Saddler of Walden,"" etc."
22309,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"These have been generally assigned to William Winstanley, the"
22310,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"barber-poet, on the ground of a supposed similarity of style, and from"
22311,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"""Poor Robin"" having been written under a portrait of him. Mr. Ecroyd"
22312,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"Smith, however, attributes them to Robert Winstanley (born, 1646, at"
22313,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"Saffron Walden), younger brother of Henry Winstanley, the projector of"
22314,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"the Eddystone Lighthouse. He assigns the credit of the ""identification"""
22315,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"to Mr. Joseph Clark, F.S.A., of the Roos, Saffron Walden, but does not"
22316,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"state the grounds which led Mr. Clark to his conclusion, in itself"
22317,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,probable enough. In any case there is no valid ground for connecting
