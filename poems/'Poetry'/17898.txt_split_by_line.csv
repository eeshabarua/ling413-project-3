99,AFTER HORACE,What asks the Bard?  He prays for nought
100,AFTER HORACE,But what the truly virtuous crave:
101,AFTER HORACE,"That is, the things he plainly ought"
102,AFTER HORACE,To have.
103,AFTER HORACE,
104,AFTER HORACE,"'Tis not for wealth, with all the shocks"
105,AFTER HORACE,"That vex distracted millionaires,"
106,AFTER HORACE,Plagued by their fluctuating stocks
107,AFTER HORACE,And shares:
108,AFTER HORACE,
109,AFTER HORACE,While plutocrats their millions new
110,AFTER HORACE,"Expend upon each costly whim,"
111,AFTER HORACE,A great deal less than theirs will do
112,AFTER HORACE,For him;
113,AFTER HORACE,
114,AFTER HORACE,The simple incomes of the poor
115,AFTER HORACE,His meek poetic soul content:
116,AFTER HORACE,"Say, L30,000 at four"
117,AFTER HORACE,Per cent.!
118,AFTER HORACE,
119,AFTER HORACE,His taste in residence is plain:
120,AFTER HORACE,No palaces his heart rejoice:
121,AFTER HORACE,A cottage in a lane (Park Lane
122,AFTER HORACE,For choice)--
123,AFTER HORACE,
124,AFTER HORACE,Here be his days in quiet spent:
125,AFTER HORACE,Here let him meditate the Muse:
126,AFTER HORACE,Baronial Halls were only meant
127,AFTER HORACE,"For Jews,"
128,AFTER HORACE,
129,AFTER HORACE,And lands that stretch with endless span
130,AFTER HORACE,"From east to west, from south to north,"
131,AFTER HORACE,Are often much more trouble than
132,AFTER HORACE,They're worth!
133,AFTER HORACE,
134,AFTER HORACE,Let epicures who eat too much
135,AFTER HORACE,Become uncomfortably stout:
136,AFTER HORACE,Let gourmets feel th' approaching touch
137,AFTER HORACE,"Of gout,--"
138,AFTER HORACE,
139,AFTER HORACE,The Bard subsists on simpler food:
140,AFTER HORACE,"A dinner, not severely plain,"
141,AFTER HORACE,A pint or so of really good
142,AFTER HORACE,Champagne--
143,AFTER HORACE,
144,AFTER HORACE,"Grant him but these, no care he'll take"
145,AFTER HORACE,"Though Laureates bask in Fortune's smile,"
146,AFTER HORACE,Though Kiplings and Corellis make
147,AFTER HORACE,Their pile:
148,AFTER HORACE,
149,AFTER HORACE,Contented with a scantier dole
150,AFTER HORACE,"His humble Muse serenely jogs,"
151,AFTER HORACE,Remote from scenes where authors roll
152,AFTER HORACE,Their logs:
153,AFTER HORACE,
154,AFTER HORACE,"Far from the madding crowd she lurks,"
155,AFTER HORACE,And really cares no single jot
156,AFTER HORACE,Whether the public read her works
157,AFTER HORACE,Or not!

167,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,"Its annual vacation,"
168,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,Their cares professional
169,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,No more avail to bind them:
170,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,They go at Pleasure's call
171,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,And leave their trades behind them.
172,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,
173,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,"Like them, departs afar"

177,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,"But not, like them, at home"

179,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,Nought can release him from
180,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,The tyranny of Letters!

185,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,His joys aesthetic cankers:
186,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,"Whate'er he sees, he knows"
187,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,He has to write upon it
188,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,A paragraph of prose
189,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,Or possibly a sonnet:
190,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,
191,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,"By mountain lakelets blue,"
192,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,"'Mid wild romantic heath, he's"
193,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,A martyr always to

201,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,"With ardour rapt he gazes,"
202,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,He's torturing his brain
203,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,For neat pictorial phrases:
204,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,When in a ship or boat
205,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,He navigates the briny
206,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,(And here 'tis his to quote

208,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,
209,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,While fellow-passengers
210,THE JOURNALIST ABROAD,"Lie stretched in mere prostration,"

236,VERNAL VERSES,Its all-pervading influence the Poet's soul obeyed--
237,VERNAL VERSES,"He made a song to greet the Spring, and this is what he made:--"

239,VERNAL VERSES,"They sadly lacked enlightenment, our ancestors of old,"
240,VERNAL VERSES,Who used to suffer simply from an ordinary cold:
241,VERNAL VERSES,"But we, of Science' mysteries less ignorant by far,"
242,VERNAL VERSES,Have nothing less distinguished than a Bronchial Catarrh!
243,VERNAL VERSES,
244,VERNAL VERSES,O when your head's a lump of lead and nought can do but sneeze:
245,VERNAL VERSES,"Whene'er in turn you freeze and burn, and then you burn and freeze:--"
246,VERNAL VERSES,"It does not mean you're going to die, although you think you are--"
247,VERNAL VERSES,These are the primal symptoms of a Bronchial Catarrh.
248,VERNAL VERSES,
249,VERNAL VERSES,"And when you've taken drugs and pills, and stayed indoors a week,"
250,VERNAL VERSES,Yet still your chest with pain opprest will hardly let you speak:
251,VERNAL VERSES,Amid your darksome miseries be this your guiding star--
252,VERNAL VERSES,'Tis simply the remainder of a Bronchial Catarrh.
253,VERNAL VERSES,
254,VERNAL VERSES,"In various ways do various men invite misfortune's rods,--"
255,VERNAL VERSES,"Some row within their College boat,--some Logic read for Mods.:"
256,VERNAL VERSES,But oh! of all the human ills our happiness that mar

1393,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),
1394,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),It was a little Bordereau that lay upon the ground:
1395,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"The Franco-Gallic Government that document it found,"
1396,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"And straightway drew the inference, though how I do not know,"
1397,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),Some Jew had sold to Germany this dreadful Bordereau.
1398,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),
1399,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),'Tis all (they said) a Hebrew trick---a treasonable plan--
1400,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"And, now we come to think of it, why Dreyfus is the man!"
1401,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"At any rate (they argued thus), it is for him to show"
1402,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),That he is not the criminal who sold the Bordereau.
1403,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),
1404,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"Some hinted at another man, whose autograph it bore--"
1405,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"But this was Dreyfus' artifice, and proved his guilt the more:"
1406,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),No motive for the horrid deed confessedly he had:
1407,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),And crimes which are gratuitous are nearly twice as bad.
1408,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),
1409,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),They caught that Jew (did Government) and charged him with the sale;
1410,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),They proved his guilt--or said they did--and shut him up in gaol;
1411,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"And then, their case to justify and show their verdict true,"
1412,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),They took and baited every one who called himself a Jew.
1413,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),
1414,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),These incidents an uproar caused like Donnybrook its Fair:
1415,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),Wherever Frenchmen met to talk 'twas Pandemonium there:
1416,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),And anywhere except in France you'd argue from events
1417,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),That Ministers had rather lost the public confidence.
1418,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),
1419,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),Then spake the German Government (and here I must deplore
1420,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),The fact that they had not presumed to mention it before):
1421,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"""Although,"" they said respectfully, ""we would not interfere"
1422,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),With any Angelegenheit outside our proper sphere--
1423,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),
1424,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),Why make this quite-essentially-unnecessary fuss?
1425,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),This compromising document was never sold to us:
1426,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"Potztausend!"" said the Chancellor, ""upon my honour, no!"
1427,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"We have not got and do not want your precious Bordereau!"""
1428,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),
1429,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"This rather struck the Ministers, in Paris where they sat:"
1430,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),They took and read the Bordereau: they had not yet done that.
1431,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),'Twas found to mention obvious facts which any one might know--
1432,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),No horrid revelations lurked within the Bordereau!
1433,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),
1434,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"And did they set poor Dreyfus free, the due amends to make,"
1435,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"Regain the public confidence by owning their mistake,"
1436,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),And cease for popularity by sordid means to bid?
1437,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),These are the things they might have done; but this is what they did:--
1438,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),
1439,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"They said, those Gallic Ministers, ""Undoubtedly it's true"
1440,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"The document has not been sold, and is not worth a _sou_;"
1441,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"But as the man's in prison now, why, there he's got to stay--"
1442,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"_Que voulez-vous_?"" they simply said, ""it is a _Chose Jugée_!"""
1443,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),
1444,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),This artless little narrative is specially designed
1445,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),To illustrate the workings of the Gallic statesman's mind;
1446,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),"And till they change those processes and mould their ways anew,"
1447,L'AFFAIRE (CHAPTER ONE),It is not yet in Paris that I want to be a Jew.

1737,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,"Now, Peter O'Shea was by nature a serf,"

1747,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,"But the Plan of Campaign, as its authors confess,"
1748,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,"Was not, on the whole, a decided success:"
1749,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,And the blackguardly minion whom tyrants employ

1752,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,"The Saxon oppressor, still potent for harm,"
1753,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,Gave Peter a lease of Cornelius' farm:
1754,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,Which Peter accepted with virtuous joy--
1755,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,For he lived quite adjacent to Mr Molloy.
1756,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,
1757,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,"Cornelius was angry (and faith he'd a right),"
1758,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,"So he came with a party to Peter's by night,"
1759,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,"And they shot through the door, with intention to slay"

1766,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,
1767,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,But the Liberal Party observed with dismay
1768,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,The outrageous proceedings of Peter O'Shea;
1769,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,"And Mr O'Kelly, our pride and our joy,"
1770,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,Made a law for restoring Cornelius Molloy.
1771,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,
1772,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,"Cornelius came back to his former abode,"
1773,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,"And Peter was houseless, and starved on the road:"
1774,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,"For Justice, whose methods O'Kelly can tell,"
1775,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,Gave Cornelius _his_ holding and Peter's as well.
1776,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,
1777,HONESTY REWARDED (1892).,It is this which inspires us with feelings of awe
