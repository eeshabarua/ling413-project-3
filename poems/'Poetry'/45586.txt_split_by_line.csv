770,CHIVALRY.,"as made the rime of infancy seem quite reesnable, though why slugs and"

772,CHIVALRY.,blush to own free and frank as I believed the time for it in reel life
773,CHIVALRY.,"was past and gone these ages, though efforts made many a year back at the"

777,CHIVALRY.,"to save their lives to get down again without most competent assistance,"

782,CHIVALRY.,"and nibbling at your cabbage sprouts is useful acts, which much I doubt,"

786,CHIVALRY.,"arx my opinion, I do consider such a ill-conwenience as there ought to be"
787,CHIVALRY.,"a deal to make up for it, and if you can’t have Chivalry without harmer I"
788,CHIVALRY.,"must say I think we’re better as we are, fur what with crinnerlin the"
789,CHIVALRY.,"world’s ardly big enough as it is, and if these coats of male was to come"

792,CHIVALRY.,"Baker Street, while as for omnibuses, my belief is they’re only kep going"

794,CHIVALRY.,"if _they_ took to harmer there’d be an end of twelve inside, much less of"

801,CHIVALRY.,"was so much superior to any think we know on in the presint day, she ses,"
802,CHIVALRY.,fur in them distant days there was galliant knights which wore a scarve
803,CHIVALRY.,"or a ribbing of the lady as they preferred, and went about the world with"
804,CHIVALRY.,long spears a defying all the other knights to say as that there lady of

815,CHIVALRY.,"inconvenience to oblige one of our sect which, especially the unprotected"

820,CHIVALRY.,"met with quite contrairy condick from well drest pussons, as doubtless"

1152,ECHOES.,ON Thursday I sat in the choir of Canterbury Cathedral and watched the
1153,ECHOES.,"Bishops, Deans, Canons, and other clergy as they walked up in procession,"
1154,ECHOES.,"leading the new Archbishop.  The Archbishop seemed, I thought, to look"
1155,ECHOES.,"with sheepish glances at two young men in full ball-room dress, who"
1156,ECHOES.,"walked behind, holding up his long train; and I am satisfied that nothing"
1157,ECHOES.,but the proprieties of the place prevented his Grace from kicking them
1158,ECHOES.,"both, and carrying his tail in his own hands.  The clergy, in their white"
1159,ECHOES.,"gowns, with their various University colours, presented a rather pleasant"
1160,ECHOES.,"appearance in the aggregate, and, with the environment of the old"
1161,ECHOES.,"Cathedral arches, I thought they must have appeared to the best"
1162,ECHOES.,advantage.  But while I gazed upon the old Archbishop and those who were
1163,ECHOES.,"doing him homage, the first notes of a distant chant broke faintly"
1164,ECHOES.,through the air.  The choristers had just entered the western door far
1165,ECHOES.,"away, and as they slowly moved at the end of the long procession, they"
1166,ECHOES.,"uttered a sweet old Gregorian chant.  At first, as I listened, I thought"
1167,ECHOES.,how very sweet it was; then I thought it was in danger of becoming
1168,ECHOES.,"monotonous; nevertheless, the little cherubs had not consulted me about"
1169,ECHOES.,"the length of it, and so continued their chant.  But then the old music"
1170,ECHOES.,"began to strike me with subtle effects, like the strain of some long"
1171,ECHOES.,sound-seasoned Cremona violin.  And at length it began to work some
1172,ECHOES.,"strange spell upon me, and weave for my ear echoes caught up as it were"
1173,ECHOES.,from the dead past which before had seemed sleeping in its many tombs
1174,ECHOES.,"around.  The echoes of wild pagan song, uttered with the tramp of mystic"
1175,ECHOES.,"dances, gathering at last to the dying groan of some poor wretch"
1176,ECHOES.,perishing on a rude altar that a complacent smile may be won to the face
1177,ECHOES.,"of his god.  The echo of the voice of a monk who finds that altar, and"
1178,ECHOES.,raises the crucifix above it.  His voice blends with the outcry of the
1179,ECHOES.,"people for their old gods, and the loud command of the baptized King."
1180,ECHOES.,What wild echoes are these hiding under that outburst of young voices?
1181,ECHOES.,The echoes of a thousand savage martyrs who will not bow down to the
1182,ECHOES.,Pope.  Their protest is stifled with their blood; they pass to Valhalla
1183,ECHOES.,for whose All-Father they have died; and the howling tempest marks his
1184,ECHOES.,passage over the scene.  Echoes again; the sounds of war.  Hark! a
1185,ECHOES.,tumult—words of anger—a hoarse cry—an Archbishop’s last sigh as his life
1186,ECHOES.,"ebbs away on the floor—there on the spot near the choir’s gate, where"
1187,ECHOES.,Archbishop Tait now gazes as if he could see the stark form of à-Becket
1188,ECHOES.,"lying there.  Yes, plainly I heard that groan in the Gregorian chant."
1189,ECHOES.,"Then there were the echoes of stripes.  A King in the dark crypt, beneath"
1190,ECHOES.,"the shrine of the murdered Archbishop, now canonized, is being scourged"
1191,ECHOES.,"in penance for his sins.  Blended with these, the echoes of the voices of"
1192,ECHOES.,"the great prelates and princes of many kingdoms, who have come to build a"
1193,ECHOES.,shrine for the martyr: their exclamations before the shrine decked with
1194,ECHOES.,"all the gleaming gems owned by the monarchs of Europe.  One of them,"
1195,ECHOES.,"Louis of France, has refused to offer a diamond, the finest in the world,"
1196,ECHOES.,"but when the shrine is uncovered, the stone leaps from his ring and sets"
1197,ECHOES.,"itself in the centre of the brilliants.  The people shout, nay, weep with"
1198,ECHOES.,excitement at this miracle.  All these I heard again in the chant.  Then
1199,ECHOES.,came pathetic echoes out of many ages: the tones of mourners as they
1200,ECHOES.,followed here their honoured dead; the prayers of souls here aspiring
1201,ECHOES.,towards the mysteries of existence; voices of hearts that found peace;
1202,ECHOES.,the sobs of those who found it not; the low-toned benediction or
1203,ECHOES.,"exhortation of confessors.  The voices of priests from pulpits, and of"
1204,ECHOES.,those who responded.  All are hushed in death; but I heard their awakened
1205,ECHOES.,"echoes.  The echoes of tolling bells, of marriage chimes.  The tones of"
1206,ECHOES.,marriage vows.  The startled cry of the infant wondering at the holy
1207,ECHOES.,water sprinkled upon it.  The echoes of Chaucer’s merry or sad pilgrims
1208,ECHOES.,"with their gracious or wanton stories, beguiling their way to the old inn"
1209,ECHOES.,"near Christ Church Gate, which one seeks now only to find it has been"
1210,ECHOES.,burnt down.  The echoes of their prayers for health at St. Dunstan’s or
1211,ECHOES.,"St. Thomas’s Shrine, and that other shrine where the stones are worn"
1212,ECHOES.,"deepest with the knees of pilgrims, but whose saint is unknown.  All"
1213,ECHOES.,these echoes were awakened for my ear by the sweet chant of the boys in
1214,ECHOES.,"Canterbury Cathedral; and unreal as they were, I confess they still seem"
1215,ECHOES.,to me more real than the actual prayers for the confusion of Dr. Tait’s
1216,ECHOES.,"imaginary enemies, or the ceremony of his enthronement.  To sit upon"
1217,ECHOES.,fourteen centuries and see a London gentleman in a coat so much too large
1218,ECHOES.,"for him that his friends have to hold up its skirts for him, and to see"
1219,ECHOES.,"plethoric Englishmen, suggestive of sirloins, on their knees praying that"
1220,ECHOES.,"the snares set for their feet shall be broken,—produced in me feelings,"
1221,ECHOES.,"to say the least, of a mixed character; such as those which may have been"
1222,ECHOES.,"experienced by the landlady in the Strand, when she found that her lodger"
1223,ECHOES.,Mr. Taylor (the Platonist) had sacrificed a bull to Jupiter in her back
1224,ECHOES.,parlour.  There is something not undignified in an old Greek sacrificing
1225,ECHOES.,"a heifer, laurel-crowned, to Zeus; and there is something not"
1226,ECHOES.,"unimpressive in old missionaries of the Cross struggling with pagan foes,"
1227,ECHOES.,and symbolizing their faith in their vesture and in their candles which
1228,ECHOES.,lit up the caves to which they often had to fly.  But to the crowd that
1229,ECHOES.,"went down between business and business, to see so long as a"
1230,ECHOES.,"return-ticket permitted this effigy of a real past, there must have been"
1231,ECHOES.,more absurdity than impressiveness in it.  From the whole pageant I
1232,ECHOES.,"recall with pleasure only the long sweet chant,—a theme ensouled by"
1233,ECHOES.,"genius and piety,—which, between the doorway and the altar, filled the"
1234,ECHOES.,"old Cathedral and made it a vast organ, with historic tones breathing the"
1235,ECHOES.,echoes of millions of heaven-seeking pilgrims whose prayers and hymns
1236,ECHOES.,"began at that spot before the advent of Christianity, and may perhaps"
1237,ECHOES.,remain there after it has passed away.

1246,EXPEDIENCY.,Better to die than not be rich: get wealth.
1247,EXPEDIENCY.,"He who has nothing, trust me, nothing is;"
1248,EXPEDIENCY.,"Nay, tenfold worse than nothing.  Not to be"

1250,EXPEDIENCY.,"’Tis to be nothing with an envious wish,"

1252,EXPEDIENCY.,"To get wealth, and to keep it—this is all,"
1253,EXPEDIENCY.,"And the one rule of life, expediency."
1254,EXPEDIENCY.,"This was the lesson that the master taught,"
1255,EXPEDIENCY.,And then he gave some rules for getting wealth:
1256,EXPEDIENCY.,"Happy, who once can say, I have a thing."
1257,EXPEDIENCY.,"All things are given us, all things to be had,"
1258,EXPEDIENCY.,"Except, alas! the faculty of having."

1260,EXPEDIENCY.,"Why, no more fruit have you, to call it having,"
1261,EXPEDIENCY.,Though a whole Autumn lay in heaps about you.
1262,EXPEDIENCY.,"How to _have_, this, my scholars, would I teach."
1263,EXPEDIENCY.,Yet who can teach it? it is great and hard.
1264,EXPEDIENCY.,"This one thing dare I say.  Be not deceived,"
1265,EXPEDIENCY.,Nor dream that those called rich _have_ anything;
1266,EXPEDIENCY.,"Who think that what the pocket treasures up,"
1267,EXPEDIENCY.,"And jealous foldings of the robe, is theirs;"
1268,EXPEDIENCY.,"Theirs all the plate the burglar cannot reach,"
1269,EXPEDIENCY.,Theirs all the land they warn the traveller off:
1270,EXPEDIENCY.,"Fools!  Because we are poorer, are they rich?"
1271,EXPEDIENCY.,"What is none other’s, is it therefore theirs?"
1272,EXPEDIENCY.,"Endeavour, O my scholars, to be rich,"
1273,EXPEDIENCY.,"Scheme to get riches when you wake from sleep,"
1274,EXPEDIENCY.,"All day pursue them, pray for them at night."
1275,EXPEDIENCY.,"As when one leans long time upon his hand,"
1276,EXPEDIENCY.,"Then, moving it, finds all its strength is gone"
1277,EXPEDIENCY.,"And it can now grasp nothing, so the soul"
1278,EXPEDIENCY.,"Loses in listlessness the grasping power,"
1279,EXPEDIENCY.,"And in the midst of wealth, _has_ nothing still."
1280,EXPEDIENCY.,"I know not, O my scholars, how to bring"
1281,EXPEDIENCY.,"The tingling blood through the soul’s palsied limbs,"
1282,EXPEDIENCY.,But when ’tis done how rich the soul may be
1283,EXPEDIENCY.,"How royal in possessions, I can tell,—"
1284,EXPEDIENCY.,One half of wisdom—seek elsewhere the other.
1285,EXPEDIENCY.,The gods divorce knowledge of good from good.
1286,EXPEDIENCY.,"He who is happy and rich does seldom know it,"
1287,EXPEDIENCY.,And he who knows the true wealth seldom has it.
1288,EXPEDIENCY.,Not only all this world of eye and ear
1289,EXPEDIENCY.,Becomes his house and palace of delights
1290,EXPEDIENCY.,Whose soul has grasping power; so that each form
1291,EXPEDIENCY.,"To him becomes a picture that is his,"
1292,EXPEDIENCY.,"The light-stream as a fountain in his court,"
1293,EXPEDIENCY.,"The murmur of all movement music to him,"
1294,EXPEDIENCY.,And time’s mere lapse rhythmical in his heart.
1295,EXPEDIENCY.,"Not only so; a greater treasure still,"
1296,EXPEDIENCY.,"The lives of other men, by sympathy"
1297,EXPEDIENCY.,"Incorporated with his own, are his."
1298,EXPEDIENCY.,"Get wealth, my scholars, this wealth first of all."
1299,EXPEDIENCY.,One life is beggary; live a thousand lives.
1300,EXPEDIENCY.,In those about you live and those remote;
1301,EXPEDIENCY.,"Live many lives at once and call it country,"
1302,EXPEDIENCY.,And call it kind; in the great future live
1303,EXPEDIENCY.,"And make it in your life rehearse its life,"
1304,EXPEDIENCY.,And make the pallid past repeat its life.

1315,EXPEDIENCY.,"Rise early, O my scholars, to be rich,"

1512,GOSSIP.,"I FEEL impelled to say a word, and it shall be but a word—and so more"
1513,GOSSIP.,"patiently endured—in defence of that much abused, much maligned"
1514,GOSSIP.,"thing—gossipry.  Johnson, among many other designations, gives for"
1515,GOSSIP.,"“gossipred,” “spiritual affinity;” a very good definition, and the one I"
1516,GOSSIP.,"shall adopt; that is, sympathy, the need to give and to receive it; and I"
1517,GOSSIP.,must say I know few things more charming than this sympathy in small
1518,GOSSIP.,"things, this gossipry between kindly hearts and well filled heads.  That"
1519,GOSSIP.,light pouring out the thoughts and feelings and observations of the
1520,GOSSIP.,"passing hour, which, while it commences with the external, is sure to"
1521,GOSSIP.,"touch, ever and anon, those deeper springs of thought, and feeling, and"
1522,GOSSIP.,"action, from which well up pleasant memories, apt thoughts, and pertinent"
1523,GOSSIP.,reflections.
1524,GOSSIP.,
1525,GOSSIP.,Poring over old letters and papers which chanced recently to come into my
1526,GOSSIP.,"hands, I came upon an old leaf of yellow paper and faded ink, which"
1527,GOSSIP.,"caught my attention; it appeared to be either a scrap of an old diary, or"
1528,GOSSIP.,"of a letter; it seemed to me somewhat germane to our present subject, and"
1529,GOSSIP.,"being venerable from its antiquity, I venture to quote it.  Its date is"
1530,GOSSIP.,"too indistinct to be sure of, but it seems to be 1700 and something."
1531,GOSSIP.,"Thus it runs:—“My husband was bidden to dinner yesterday to our Rector’s,"
1532,GOSSIP.,"I with him; my husband was pleased thereat, because there was, he said,"
1533,GOSSIP.,"to be there a man of parts, from London; so I laid out my husband’s best"
1534,GOSSIP.,"coat and long flowered waistcoat, and his kerseys and silk stockings,"
1535,GOSSIP.,"which he did not often wear, for I desired him to be seemly in his"
1536,GOSSIP.,"attire, that he might do fitting honour to our Rector; I was a little"
1537,GOSSIP.,flustered at first with the notion of this great man; but I noted that my
1538,GOSSIP.,husband bore himself towards him exactly as if he had been an ordinary
1539,GOSSIP.,man.  At table I found myself set next to him.  The gardens at the great
1540,GOSSIP.,"house are very fine, and kept excellently well, as indeed is not"
1541,GOSSIP.,"wonderful, as there are two whole gardeners and a boy to do the work."
1542,GOSSIP.,"Looking out of the large bay-window which looked upon the flower garden,"
1543,GOSSIP.,"and stood open, for it was mighty warm, I could not keep my eyes off the"
1544,GOSSIP.,"flowers, they were so exceeding gay; the sun shone out surprisingly; one"
1545,GOSSIP.,spot in particular took my attention: a large clump of daffodils had been
1546,GOSSIP.,"allowed on the lawn, the grass was high round them, and on the top of"
1547,GOSSIP.,every blade there was a drop that sparkled like a diamond—for there had
1548,GOSSIP.,"been a slight shower—and as I looked upon them, I thought of the"
1549,GOSSIP.,"description in holy writ of the gates of the temple of Jerusalem, all"
1550,GOSSIP.,studded with sapphires and emeralds and diamonds; and I was so taken up
1551,GOSSIP.,"that I forgot it was the great man that was sitting by me, and I asked"
1552,GOSSIP.,"him if it was not beautiful?  ‘It is vastly fine indeed, ma’am,’ he said;"
1553,GOSSIP.,"but he looked at me with wonderment, I thought, and from the look in his"
1554,GOSSIP.,"eyes, I am sure he did not know a daffodil from a daisy, poor man.  So I"
1555,GOSSIP.,"felt very much abashed, and sat still and said no more; and there was not"
1556,GOSSIP.,"much discourse, but everybody looked wise and silent; and I remembered"
1557,GOSSIP.,"that somewhere it is said, it is a grand thing to know how to be silent;"
1558,GOSSIP.,"but I thought a little talking would have been more agreeable, only"
1559,GOSSIP.,"perhaps not so wise-like, only of course I knew I was quite a common"
1560,GOSSIP.,"person, and had no parts at all; so when it was about three of the"
1561,GOSSIP.,"clock—the hour fixed for the dinner was rather late, as it was a bye"
1562,GOSSIP.,common occasion—and we ladies left the gentlemen to settle down to their
1563,GOSSIP.,"wine, I thought I would go home to my children, for I thought our lady"
1564,GOSSIP.,Rector looked somewhat puffed up and stately with the great honour she
1565,GOSSIP.,"had had, and done to us; and to say the very truth, I felt longing to"
1566,GOSSIP.,speak and to hear in the ordinary way.  So I took my leave in a beseeming
1567,GOSSIP.,"and courteous manner, and stepped across to my own place; and my eldest"
1568,GOSSIP.,daughter came running to me and said she had got so many things to tell
1569,GOSSIP.,me; and then out of her little heart she poured out all her little
1570,GOSSIP.,"troubles and pleasures; and oh! she said, little brother had been so"
1571,GOSSIP.,"naughty, and had cried dreadfully for the pretty cup from China, and"
1572,GOSSIP.,"stamped and fought her when she would not let him have it, because dear"
1573,GOSSIP.,"mamma liked it so much, and would be sorry to have it broken.  ‘But then,"
1574,GOSSIP.,"mamma,’ she said, ‘when he got a little quieter, I talked to him, and"
1575,GOSSIP.,"hushed him and kissed him, and so he was soon good, and we had a great"
1576,GOSSIP.,"game at horses.’  Then I kissed the little maid, and called her a ‘dear"
1577,GOSSIP.,"little mother,’ but she was greatly puzzled, and said, ‘Oh, mamma, I am"
1578,GOSSIP.,only a little girl.’  Then she said I must tell her all about the
1579,GOSSIP.,"gentleman that she had heard papa say had a great many parts—‘more, I"
1580,GOSSIP.,"suppose, mamma, than any of us.’  I only kissed her at this, and told her"
1581,GOSSIP.,of the golden daffodils and many other flowers I had noticed; and of two
1582,GOSSIP.,great blackbirds I had seen hopping very lovingly together upon the lawn.
1583,GOSSIP.,She said she liked to hear of these extremely; and I told of the roast
1584,GOSSIP.,"sucking-pig with an orange in its mouth, which was at the top of the"
1585,GOSSIP.,table; but she did not like this; she said it would remind her of the
1586,GOSSIP.,"little piggy running about, which that little pig would never do any"
1587,GOSSIP.,"more.  Then she said she would tell me of one of her little misfortunes,"
1588,GOSSIP.,which she thought was almost a big one: ‘the poor brown hen with ten
1589,GOSSIP.,"little chicks had been shut up by themselves, because the little chicks"
1590,GOSSIP.,"would run about too far; and the boy had forgotten them, and they had"
1591,GOSSIP.,been shut up without anything to eat for ever so many hours; and when we
1592,GOSSIP.,"put some barley in, dear old browney clucked and clucked, and showed the"
1593,GOSSIP.,"grains to the chicks, but never touched one herself, mamma, and when the"
1594,GOSSIP.,"little chicks had eaten till they were quite full, she called them all"
1595,GOSSIP.,"under her wings, and they went fast asleep; but then, mamma, there was"
1596,GOSSIP.,not one single barley left near the poor mother; and so I do believe
1597,GOSSIP.,"mamma, she would have been quite starved to death, only we put some"
1598,GOSSIP.,barley and some nice crumbs quite close to her; so she got them without
1599,GOSSIP.,"moving a bit, or waking the chicks, and oh, mamma, she did gobble it up"
1600,GOSSIP.,"so fast; I know she was so hungry, for she did not eat one single"
1601,GOSSIP.,"barley-corn before, for I watched her all the time; wasn’t it sweet and"
1602,GOSSIP.,"good of her, mamma?  I shall love that dear old browney for always.’  And"
1603,GOSSIP.,"so my little daughter and I chatted away and enjoyed ourselves hugely,"
1604,GOSSIP.,"till my dear good man, who I had thought was sitting over his wine, and"
1605,GOSSIP.,perhaps his pipe—but I don’t know about that because of the company—came
1606,GOSSIP.,"suddenly behind us.  He kissed us both, saying, ‘My two sweet gossips, it"
1607,GOSSIP.,"does my heart good to hear you.  It seems to me, my Margery,’ he said,"
1608,GOSSIP.,‘that our little one here hath both a sound heart and a wise head.’”
1609,GOSSIP.,
1610,GOSSIP.,"There the paper is torn, and I could see no other word.  It appears to me"
1611,GOSSIP.,"that this, and many other gossipries, are, in their small way, good, and"
1612,GOSSIP.,"that when they are not good, it is because the heart is cankered, and the"
1613,GOSSIP.,head empty; and so we come round to the conclusion on all subjects and on
1614,GOSSIP.,"all difficulties, especially social difficulties—educate, educate,"
1615,GOSSIP.,"educate; teach the mind to find subjects for thought in all things, and"
1616,GOSSIP.,"purify the heart by enabling it to find “sermons in stones, and good in"
1617,GOSSIP.,everything;” then will Gossip be the graceful unbending of the loving
1618,GOSSIP.,heart and well-filled head.

1866,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"Me, merchants from Honduras found"
1867,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,Who had not got a log any;
1868,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,They cut me prostrate on the ground
1869,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,To make first-rate mahogany.
1870,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,
1871,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,They pack’d me in a darksome hold;
1872,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,We cross’d the ocean quivering;
1873,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,They took me to a region cold
1874,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,That set my timbers shivering;
1875,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"Above, an atmosphere of fog;"

1879,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,
1880,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,And then they came with rule and chalk
1881,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"Numb’ring my feet and inches,"
1882,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,And pack’d us high beside that walk
1883,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"With pullies, cranks, and winches;"
1884,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"And one by one my logs were sold,"

1958,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,The sounding-board was my own wood—
1959,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"(That, and the words were hollow):"
1960,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,
1961,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,And I’ve wandered to the library—
1962,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,The bookshelves there were mine—
1963,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,Belonging to one of the Ministry;

1965,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"(I thought the pay seem’d very high,"
1966,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"The work of an easy nature,"

1969,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,To sit in the Legislature):

1971,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"And I’ve been up a dismal attic flight,"
1972,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"Not knowing why there I hasten’d,"
1973,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,And I found ’twas the sewing-table bright
1974,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,To which a machine was fasten’d;
1975,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"And a girl was working, so pale and drear,"
1976,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"And in such a forlorn condition,"
1977,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"That, ghost as I was, I had shed a tear,"
1978,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"But I knew that that garret was woman’s sphere,"
1979,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,And dressmaking her mission.
1980,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,
1981,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,Last month I came to a table round
1982,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"Which cover’d, to my surprise, is,"
1983,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"(Whilst a critical crowd collects around,)"
1984,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,With chips of all lengths and sizes:
1985,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,And I knew I’d found the last piece of wood;
1986,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,"And back, to my former station,"
1987,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,My spirit crossed the Atlantic flood
1988,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,To begin a new transformation.
1989,THE LAST SPEECH AND CONFESSION OF A MAHOGANY-TREE NYMPH.,So I laid the glimpses that I had had

1998,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.
1999,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,
2000,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,
2001,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"THE fisherman walked up the hill,"
2002,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"His boat lay on the sand,"
2003,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"His net was on his shoulder still,"
2004,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,His home a mile inland.
2005,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And as he walk’d among the whin
2006,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"He saw a little white seal-skin,"
2007,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Which he took up in his hand.
2008,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Then “How,” said he, “can this thing be?"
2009,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"A seal-skin, and no seal within?”"
2010,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Thus pondered he,"
2011,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Partly in fear,"
2012,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Till he remember’d what he’d heard
2013,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Of creatures in the sea,—"
2014,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Sea-men and women, who are stirred"
2015,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,One day in every year
2016,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"To drop their seal-skins on the sand,"
2017,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"To leave the sea, and seek the land"
2018,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"For twelve long hours,"
2019,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Playing about in sweet sunshine,"
2020,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Among the corn-fields, with corn-flowers,"
2021,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Wild roses, and woodbine:"
2022,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Till night comes on, and then they flit"
2023,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Adown the fields, and sit"
2024,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Upon the shore and put their seal-skins on,"
2025,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And slip into the sea, and they are gone."
2026,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,The fisherman strok’d the fur
2027,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Of the little white seal-skin,"
2028,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Soft as silk, and white as snow;"
2029,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And he said to himself, “I know"
2030,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,That some little sea-woman lived in
2031,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"This seal-skin, perhaps not long ago."
2032,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,I wonder what has become of her!
2033,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And why she left this on the whin,"
2034,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Instead of slipping it on again
2035,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,When all the little sea-women and men
2036,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Went hurrying down to the sea!
2037,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Ah! well, she never meant"
2038,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"It for me,"
2039,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"That I should take it, but I will,"
2040,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Home to my house on the hill,”"
2041,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Said the fisherman; and home he went.
2042,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,
2043,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"The Fisher dozed before his fire,"
2044,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"The night was cold outside,"
2045,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,The bright full moon was rising higher
2046,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Above the swelling tide,"
2047,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And the wind brought the sound of breakers nigher,"
2048,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Even to the hill side;
2049,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,When suddenly
2050,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Something broke at the cottage door,"
2051,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Like the plash
2052,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Of a little wave on a pebbly shore;
2053,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And as water frets in the backward drain
2054,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Of the wave, seeming to fall in pain,"
2055,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,There came a wailing after the plash.—
2056,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"The fisherman woke, and said, “Is it rain?”"
2057,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Then he rose from his seat
2058,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And open’d his door a little way,"
2059,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,But soon shut it again
2060,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,With a kind of awe;
2061,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,For the prettiest little sea-woman lay
2062,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,On the grass at his feet
2063,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,That you ever saw;
2064,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"She began to sob and to say,"
2065,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,“Who has stolen my skin from me?
2066,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And who is there will take me in?
2067,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"For I have lost my little seal-skin,"
2068,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And I can’t get back to the sea.”
2069,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,
2070,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,The Fisherman stroked the fur
2071,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Of the downy white seal-skin,"
2072,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And he said, “Shall I give it her?—"
2073,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"But then she would get in,"
2074,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And hurry away to the sea,"
2075,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And not come back to me,"
2076,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And I should be sorry all my life,"
2077,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,I want her so for my little wife.”
2078,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"The Fisherman thought for a minute,"
2079,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Then he carried the seal-skin to
2080,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"A secret hole in the thatch,"
2081,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Where he hid it cleverly, so"
2082,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"That a sharp-sighted person might go,"
2083,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,In front of the hole and not catch
2084,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,A glimpse of the seal-skin within it.
2085,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,After this he lifted the latch
2086,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Of his door once more,"
2087,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"But the night was darker, for"
2088,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"The moon was swimming under a cloud,"
2089,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,So the Fisherman couldn’t see
2090,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"The little sea-woman plainly,"
2091,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Seeing a fleck of white foam only,"
2092,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,That was sobbing aloud
2093,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,As before.
2094,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,
2095,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"“Little sea-woman,” said the Fisherman,"
2096,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"“Will you come home to me,"
2097,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Will you help me to work, and help me to save,"
2098,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Care for my house and me,"
2099,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And the little children that we shall have?”
2100,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"“Yes, Fisherman,” said she."
2101,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"So the Fisherman had his way,"
2102,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And seven years of life
2103,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Pass’d by him like one happy day;
2104,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"But, as for his sea-wife,"
2105,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,She sorrowed for the sea alway
2106,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And loved not her land life.
2107,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Morning and evening, and all day"
2108,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,She would say
2109,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,To herself—“The sea! the sea!”
2110,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And at night, when dreaming,"
2111,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"She stretch’d her arms about her, seeming"
2112,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"To seek little Willie,"
2113,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,It was the sea
2114,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"She would have clasp’d, not he—"
2115,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"The great sea’s purple water,"
2116,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Dearer to her than little son or daughter.
2117,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Yet she was kind
2118,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"To her children three,"
2119,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Harry, fair Alice, and baby Willie;"
2120,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And set her mind
2121,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,To keep things orderly.
2122,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"“Only,” thought she,"
2123,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,“If I _could_ but find
2124,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,That little seal-skin I lost one day.”
2125,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,She didn’t know
2126,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,That her husband had it hidden away;
2127,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Nor he
2128,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,That she long’d for it so.
2129,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Until
2130,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"One evening as he climb’d the hill,"
2131,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"The Fisherman found her amongst the whin,"
2132,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Sobbing, saying, “My little seal-skin—"
2133,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Who has stolen my skin from me?
2134,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"How shall I find it, and get in,"
2135,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And hurry away to the sea?”
2136,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"“Then she shall have her will,”"
2137,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Said he.
2138,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,
2139,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,So
2140,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Next morning, when he rose to go"
2141,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"A-fishing, and his wife still slept,"
2142,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,He stole
2143,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,The seal-skin from that secret hole
2144,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Where he had kept
2145,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"It, and flung it on a chair,"
2146,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Saying, “She will be glad to find it there"
2147,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,To-day
2148,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"When I am gone,"
2149,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And yet
2150,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Perhaps she will not put it on,”"
2151,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"He said, “Nor go away.”"
2152,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,In sleeping his wife wept;
2153,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Then the Fisherman took his net
2154,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And crept
2155,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Into the chill air.
2156,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,
2157,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"The night drew on—the air was still,"
2158,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Homeward the fisher climbed the hill.
2159,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"All day he’d thought, “She will not go;”"
2160,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And now, “She has not,” pondered he."
2161,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"“She is not gone,” he said, “I know,"
2162,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"There is a lamp in our window,"
2163,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Put ready on the sill
2164,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"To guide me home, and I shall see"
2165,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"The dear light glimmering presently,"
2166,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Just as I round the hill.”
2167,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"But when he turn’d, there was no light"
2168,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,To guide him homeward through the night.
2169,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Then, “I am late,” he said,"
2170,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,“And maybe she was weary
2171,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Looking so long for me.
2172,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,She lays the little ones in bed
2173,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Well content,"
2174,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"In the inner room where I shall find her,"
2175,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And where she went,"
2176,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Forgetting to leave the light behind her.”
2177,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,
2178,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"So he came to his cottage door,"
2179,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And threw it open wide;
2180,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"But stood a breathing space, before"
2181,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,He dared to look inside.
2182,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"No fire was in the fireplace, nor"
2183,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,A light on any side;
2184,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"But a little heap lay on the floor,"
2185,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And the voice of a baby cried.
2186,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Rocking and moaning on the floor,"
2187,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,That little heap
2188,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Was the children, tired with crying,"
2189,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Trying to sleep,"
2190,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Moaning and rocking to and fro;
2191,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,But Baby Willie hindered the trying
2192,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,By wailing so.
2193,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,
2194,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Then “Wife! wife!” said the Fisherman,"
2195,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,“Come from the inner room.”
2196,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"There was no answer, and he ran"
2197,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Searching into the gloom.
2198,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,
2199,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,“Wife! wife! why don’t you come?
2200,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"The children want you, and I’ve come home.”"
2201,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"“Mammy’s gone, Daddy,” said Harry—"
2202,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,“Gone into the sea;
2203,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,She’ll never come back to carry
2204,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Tired Baby Willie.
2205,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"It’s no use now, Daddy, looking about;"
2206,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,I can tell you just how it all fell out.
2207,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,
2208,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,“There was a seal-skin
2209,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,In the kitchen—
2210,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,A little crumpled thing;
2211,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,I can’t think how it came there;
2212,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,But this morning
2213,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Mammy found it on a chair,"
2214,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And when she began
2215,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"To feel it, she dropped"
2216,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,It on the floor—
2217,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,But snatch’d it up again and ran
2218,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Straight out at the door,"
2219,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And never stopped
2220,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Till she-reach’d the shore.
2221,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,
2222,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"“Then we three, Daddy,"
2223,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Ran after, crying, ‘Take us to the sea!"
2224,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Wait for us, Mammy, we are coming too!"
2225,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Here’s Alice, Willie can’t keep up with you!"
2226,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Mammy, stop—just for a minute or two!’"
2227,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"But Alice said, ‘Maybe"
2228,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,She’s making us a boat
2229,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Out of the seal-skin cleverly,"
2230,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And by-and-by she’ll float
2231,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,It on the water from the sands
2232,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,For us.’  Then Willie clapt his hands
2233,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And shouted, ‘Run on, Mammy, to the sea,"
2234,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And we are coming, Willie understands.’"
2235,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,
2236,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,“At last we came to where the hill
2237,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Slopes straight down to the beach,"
2238,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"And there we stood all breathless, still,"
2239,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Fast clinging each to each.
2240,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"We saw her sitting upon a stone,"
2241,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Putting the little seal-skin on.
2242,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,Oh!  Mammy!  Mammy!
2243,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"She never said good-bye, Daddy,"
2244,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,She didn’t kiss us three;
2245,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"She just put the little seal-skin on,"
2246,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,And slipped into the sea!
2247,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,"Oh!  Mammy’s gone, Daddy; Mammy’s gone!"
2248,LITTLE SEAL-SKIN.,She slipp’d into the sea!”

2253,A SURPRISE.,A SURPRISE.
2254,A SURPRISE.,
2255,A SURPRISE.,
2256,A SURPRISE.,“SHE is dead!” they said to him.  “Come away;
2257,A SURPRISE.,Kiss her! and leave her!—thy love is clay!”
2258,A SURPRISE.,
2259,A SURPRISE.,They smoothed her tresses of dark brown hair;
2260,A SURPRISE.,On her forehead of stone they laid it fair:
2261,A SURPRISE.,
2262,A SURPRISE.,"Over her eyes, which gazed too much,"
2263,A SURPRISE.,They drew the lids with a gentle touch;
2264,A SURPRISE.,
2265,A SURPRISE.,With a tender touch they closed up well
2266,A SURPRISE.,The sweet thin lips that had secrets to tell;
2267,A SURPRISE.,
2268,A SURPRISE.,"About her brows, and her dear, pale face"
2269,A SURPRISE.,They tied her veil and her marriage-lace;
2270,A SURPRISE.,
2271,A SURPRISE.,And drew on her white feet her white silk shoes;—
2272,A SURPRISE.,Which were the whiter no eye could choose!
2273,A SURPRISE.,
2274,A SURPRISE.,And over her bosom they crossed her hands;
2275,A SURPRISE.,"“Come away,” they said,—“God understands!”"
2276,A SURPRISE.,
2277,A SURPRISE.,And then there was Silence;—and nothing there
2278,A SURPRISE.,"But the Silence—and scents of eglantere,"
2279,A SURPRISE.,
2280,A SURPRISE.,"And jasmine, and roses, and rosemary;"
2281,A SURPRISE.,"For they said, “As a lady should lie, lies she!”"
2282,A SURPRISE.,
2283,A SURPRISE.,"And they held their breath as they left the room,"
2284,A SURPRISE.,With a shudder to glance at its stillness and gloom.
2285,A SURPRISE.,
2286,A SURPRISE.,But he—who loved her too well to dread
2287,A SURPRISE.,"The sweet, the stately, the beautiful dead,—"
2288,A SURPRISE.,
2289,A SURPRISE.,"He lit his lamp, and took the key,"
2290,A SURPRISE.,And turn’d it!—Alone again—he and she!
2291,A SURPRISE.,
2292,A SURPRISE.,"He and she; but she would not speak,"
2293,A SURPRISE.,"Though he kiss’d, in the old place, the quiet cheek;"
2294,A SURPRISE.,
2295,A SURPRISE.,"He and she; yet she would not smile,"
2296,A SURPRISE.,Though he call’d her the name that was fondest erewhile.
2297,A SURPRISE.,
2298,A SURPRISE.,He and she; and she did not move
2299,A SURPRISE.,To any one passionate whisper of love.
2300,A SURPRISE.,
2301,A SURPRISE.,"Then he said, “Cold lips! and breast without breath!"
2302,A SURPRISE.,Is there no voice?—no language of death
2303,A SURPRISE.,
2304,A SURPRISE.,"“Dumb to the ear and still to the sense,"
2305,A SURPRISE.,"But to heart and to soul distinct,—intense?"
2306,A SURPRISE.,
2307,A SURPRISE.,"“See, now,—I listen with soul, not ear—"
2308,A SURPRISE.,"What was the secret of dying, Dear?"
2309,A SURPRISE.,
2310,A SURPRISE.,"“Was it the infinite wonder of all,"
2311,A SURPRISE.,That you ever could let life’s flower fall?
2312,A SURPRISE.,
2313,A SURPRISE.,“Or was it a greater marvel to feel
2314,A SURPRISE.,The perfect calm o’er the agony steal?
2315,A SURPRISE.,
2316,A SURPRISE.,"“Was the miracle greatest to find how deep,"
2317,A SURPRISE.,"Beyond all dreams, sank downward that sleep?"
2318,A SURPRISE.,
2319,A SURPRISE.,"“Did life roll backward its record, Dear,"
2320,A SURPRISE.,"And show, as they say it does, past things clear?"
2321,A SURPRISE.,
2322,A SURPRISE.,“And was it the innermost heart of the bliss
2323,A SURPRISE.,To find out so what a wisdom love is?
2324,A SURPRISE.,
2325,A SURPRISE.,"“Oh, perfect Dead! oh, Dead most dear,"
2326,A SURPRISE.,I hold the breath of my soul to hear;
2327,A SURPRISE.,
2328,A SURPRISE.,"“I listen—as deep as to horrible hell,"
2329,A SURPRISE.,As high as to heaven!—and you do not tell!
2330,A SURPRISE.,
2331,A SURPRISE.,"“There must be pleasures in dying, Sweet,"
2332,A SURPRISE.,To make you so placid from head to feet!
2333,A SURPRISE.,
2334,A SURPRISE.,"“I would tell you, Darling, if I were dead,"
2335,A SURPRISE.,And ’twere your hot tears upon my brow shed.
2336,A SURPRISE.,
2337,A SURPRISE.,"“I would say, though the angel of death had laid"
2338,A SURPRISE.,His sword on my lips to keep it unsaid.
2339,A SURPRISE.,
2340,A SURPRISE.,"“You should not ask, vainly, with streaming eyes,"
2341,A SURPRISE.,Which in Death’s touch was the chiefest surprise;
2342,A SURPRISE.,
2343,A SURPRISE.,“The very strangest and suddenest thing
2344,A SURPRISE.,Of all the surprises that dying must bring.”
2345,A SURPRISE.,
2346,A SURPRISE.,* * * *
2347,A SURPRISE.,
2348,A SURPRISE.,Ah! foolish world!  Oh! most kind Dead!
2349,A SURPRISE.,"Though he told me, who will believe it was said?"
2350,A SURPRISE.,
2351,A SURPRISE.,"Who will believe that he heard her say,"
2352,A SURPRISE.,"With the soft rich voice, in the dear old way:—"
2353,A SURPRISE.,
2354,A SURPRISE.,"“The utmost wonder is this,—I hear,"
2355,A SURPRISE.,"And see you, and love you, and kiss you, Dear;"
2356,A SURPRISE.,
2357,A SURPRISE.,"“I can speak now you listen with soul, not ear;"
2358,A SURPRISE.,"If your soul could see, it would all be clear"
2359,A SURPRISE.,
2360,A SURPRISE.,"“What a strange delicious amazement is Death,"
2361,A SURPRISE.,To be without body and breathe without breath.
2362,A SURPRISE.,
2363,A SURPRISE.,“I should laugh for joy if you did not cry;
2364,A SURPRISE.,"Oh, listen!  Love lasts!—Love never will die."
2365,A SURPRISE.,
2366,A SURPRISE.,“I am only your Angel who was your Bride;

2372,THE GLOAMING.,THE GLOAMING.
2373,THE GLOAMING.,
2374,THE GLOAMING.,
2375,THE GLOAMING.,THE gloaming! the gloaming!  “What is the gloaming?” was asked by some
2376,THE GLOAMING.,"honourable member of this honourable Society, when the word was chosen a"
2377,THE GLOAMING.,"month ago.  “Twilight,” was promptly answered by another honourable"
2378,THE GLOAMING.,"member!  And although the gloaming is undoubtedly _twilight_, is twilight"
2379,THE GLOAMING.,"as undoubtedly the gloaming?—the gloaming of Burns, of Scott, the"
2380,THE GLOAMING.,gloaming so often referred to in our old Northern minstrelsy?  The City
2381,THE GLOAMING.,"clerk on the knife-board of his familiar “bus,” soothing himself with a"
2382,THE GLOAMING.,"fragrant Pickwick, after his ten hours’ labour in that turmoil and eddy"
2383,THE GLOAMING.,"of restless humanity—the City—may see, as he rolls westward, the sun"
2384,THE GLOAMING.,slowly sinking and setting in its fiery grandeur behind the Marble Arch.
2385,THE GLOAMING.,He may see the shades of evening stealing over the Park and the Bayswater
2386,THE GLOAMING.,"Road, and darkness settling softly over gentle Notting Hill; and he may"
2387,THE GLOAMING.,"see, if there be no fog, or not too much smoke in the atmosphere to"
2388,THE GLOAMING.,"prevent astronomical observations, the stars stealing out one by one in"
2389,THE GLOAMING.,"the Heavens above him, as the gas-lamps are being lit in the streets"
2390,THE GLOAMING.,"around him; but would that observant youth on his knife-board, with his"
2391,THE GLOAMING.,"Pickwick, amidst the lamp-lights, in the roar of London, be justified in"
2392,THE GLOAMING.,describing what he had seen as “the gloaming?”  I think not.  Is not the
2393,THE GLOAMING.,"gloaming twilight only in certain localities, and under certain"
2394,THE GLOAMING.,"conditions?  Is not the gloaming chiefly confined to the North country,"
2395,THE GLOAMING.,or to mountainous districts?  It is difficult to say where the gloaming
2396,THE GLOAMING.,"shall be called gloaming no more, and where twilight is just simple"
2397,THE GLOAMING.,"twilight, and no gloaming; but surely there lives not the man who will"
2398,THE GLOAMING.,assert that he has seen a real gloaming effect in the _Tottenham Court
2399,THE GLOAMING.,"Road_, for instance!"
2400,THE GLOAMING.,
2401,THE GLOAMING.,Can it be applied to eventide in the flat fens of Lincolnshire and
2402,THE GLOAMING.,Cambridgeshire?  Does the gloaming ever fall on the manufacturing
2403,THE GLOAMING.,"districts of Yorkshire—Leeds, Sheffield, Huddersfield?  Twilight in the"
2404,THE GLOAMING.,"Potteries is surely twilight and no gloaming.  May not, are not the"
2405,THE GLOAMING.,limits within which the latter word may be used as aptly describing
2406,THE GLOAMING.,"eventide, be the limits within which our old balladry sprung and"
2407,THE GLOAMING.,"flourished?  May not, are not the limits within which the word is wholly"
2408,THE GLOAMING.,"inapplicable to describe the close of day, be the limits within which the"
2409,THE GLOAMING.,"love of song was not so strongly developed—where external nature did not,"
2410,THE GLOAMING.,"and does not suggest song, or poetry to the mind?  Well, that definition"
2411,THE GLOAMING.,"is quite enough for the present day, in which “hard and fast lines” are"
2412,THE GLOAMING.,"at a discount!  But there is still that awkward question, “What is the"
2413,THE GLOAMING.,gloaming?”  And what is there in the gloaming that distinguishes it from
2414,THE GLOAMING.,that which is twilight merely?  To answer that with any hope of conveying
2415,THE GLOAMING.,"any sense of the difference which undoubtedly _does_ exist, is a matter"
2416,THE GLOAMING.,which is beyond the capacity of any one not being a Ruskin.  As to
2417,THE GLOAMING.,"_define_ the gloaming is beyond the powers of ordinary mortals, and as"
2418,THE GLOAMING.,ostracism is threatened if I do not do something—as I am writing _in
2419,THE GLOAMING.,"terrorem_, and to save my pen-and-pencil existence, which is hanging on"
2420,THE GLOAMING.,"this slender thread—I will, in default of being able to do better, give"
2421,THE GLOAMING.,my own experiences of a real “GLOAMING.”
2422,THE GLOAMING.,
2423,THE GLOAMING.,"Time of year—the end of August.  Locality, _not_ the Tottenham Court"
2424,THE GLOAMING.,"Road, but one of the northernmost points of the Northumberland border—a"
2425,THE GLOAMING.,"wild, rough, hard land—the fighting ground, for centuries upon centuries,"
2426,THE GLOAMING.,"first of the old Romans, and then of our own border laddies, who held it"
2427,THE GLOAMING.,against the “rieving Scots”—a land over which the famous Sixth Legion has
2428,THE GLOAMING.,marched—a land which has seen Hotspur fight and Douglas fall—a land where
2429,THE GLOAMING.,almost every hillside and burn has its legend and ballad—a land on which
2430,THE GLOAMING.,"one would reasonably expect to see the gloaming, as distinguished from"
2431,THE GLOAMING.,"twilight, fall!  I had had ten days walking after wild grouse—tramping"
2432,THE GLOAMING.,"through the heather, generally dripping wet, for the Scotch mist did not"
2433,THE GLOAMING.,"observe or keep the border line, worse luck to it.  At last a fine day,"
2434,THE GLOAMING.,"and a long tramp on the moors.  At the close of it, having first walked"
2435,THE GLOAMING.,enough over the soft moss and young heather to make me exult in the grand
2436,THE GLOAMING.,"condition for exercise which ten days’ hill air will give, I separated"
2437,THE GLOAMING.,"from my party to try for a snipe down by a little tarn, lying in the"
2438,THE GLOAMING.,"midst of a “faded bent” in the moor, intending to tramp home afterwards"
2439,THE GLOAMING.,in my own company—and in my own company it _was_ that I had full
2440,THE GLOAMING.,opportunity of studying the effect of the gloaming.
2441,THE GLOAMING.,
2442,THE GLOAMING.,The sun was getting low as I separated from my party and walked up the
2443,THE GLOAMING.,"side of a long hill covered with old heather, moss, patches of grass,"
2444,THE GLOAMING.,"patches of reeds, and bogs.  It was a glorious scene!  A sea of"
2445,THE GLOAMING.,moorland—wave over wave of undulating hill—rolled from me northward to
2446,THE GLOAMING.,"the foot of old Cheviot, whose long back, some twenty miles away, was lit"
2447,THE GLOAMING.,up by the brilliant sinking sun so clearly that I could distinguish the
2448,THE GLOAMING.,"gullies and inequalities in its time-honoured old sides.  Wave over wave,"
2449,THE GLOAMING.,"southward and westward, rolled those same moorland hills from my feet,"
2450,THE GLOAMING.,"seemingly into the still more distant hills of Cumberland, and from north"
2451,THE GLOAMING.,"to south, east to west, was a sea of purple heather in its fullest bloom,"
2452,THE GLOAMING.,lit up by the golden floods of light of the setting sun.  In another five
2453,THE GLOAMING.,"minutes the sun had disappeared, and I was down by the side of the little"
2454,THE GLOAMING.,"Tarn.  Already the air, always fresh on the hills, became fresher; the"
2455,THE GLOAMING.,golden light was dying out of the sky; the blue of the Heaven above me
2456,THE GLOAMING.,"was darkening, the hills, a mass of purple sheen so few minutes ago,"
2457,THE GLOAMING.,stood out sharp and black against the sky; and so I started on my long
2458,THE GLOAMING.,"tramp home, watching the growth of the “gloaming.”  There was still the"
2459,THE GLOAMING.,"heather.  I was still tramping through it, but its colour was gone.  It"
2460,THE GLOAMING.,was now an expanse of purple blackness.  More intensely dark became the
2461,THE GLOAMING.,"blue of the sky above me as the red streaks, still hovering over the"
2462,THE GLOAMING.,"place where the sun had dipped, faded.  Gradually, imperceptibly was"
2463,THE GLOAMING.,"darkness spreading over everything; and as the darkness spread, the"
2464,THE GLOAMING.,stillness and sweetness of the “gloaming” made itself felt.  The
2465,THE GLOAMING.,"stillness and freshness of the air, the mysterious blackness of the"
2466,THE GLOAMING.,"hills; the startling white flashes of the little pools, in the moors,"
2467,THE GLOAMING.,"looking as though they had absorbed light from somewhere, and were loth"
2468,THE GLOAMING.,to part with it; the faintly reflected colours of the fading sky given
2469,THE GLOAMING.,"back by the burns and streamlets which crossed my path, the whispering of"
2470,THE GLOAMING.,the reeds and long grass; the great grey boulders looming here and there
2471,THE GLOAMING.,through the dark heather and bracken—boulders behind which at that hour
2472,THE GLOAMING.,"one could not help believing that Kelpies and Pixies were hiding, and"
2473,THE GLOAMING.,might dart out at any moment for some Tam-o’-Shanter frolic over the
2474,THE GLOAMING.,"moor—and the soft springy moss, grass, and heather, still under my feet"
2475,THE GLOAMING.,"deadening all the sound of my tread.  Light dying, fading, and darkness,"
2476,THE GLOAMING.,"a rich purple darkness, spreading; and everywhere the scent of heather"
2477,THE GLOAMING.,"bloom and stillness and freshness—freshness indescribable, a stillness"
2478,THE GLOAMING.,only broken by the call here and there of the scattered grouse; or the
2479,THE GLOAMING.,soft rush of wings and whistling of golden plover far away over head; or
2480,THE GLOAMING.,the cry of the lapwing—or the bark miles away of a collie dog; or the
2481,THE GLOAMING.,dripping and murmuring and bubbling of the little burns in the gullies!
2482,THE GLOAMING.,
2483,THE GLOAMING.,Light still dying away!  What was left only “dealt a doubtful sense of
2484,THE GLOAMING.,things not so much seen as felt.”  And then it was that I realized what
2485,THE GLOAMING.,Robert Burns had sung:—
2486,THE GLOAMING.,
2487,THE GLOAMING.,"“Gie me the hour o’ gloamin grey,"

2519,KATEY.,"“THERE!  I have finished my sketch of the sloping field, and the misty"
2520,KATEY.,"strip of woodland above, in its autumn dress, by putting you in in the"
2521,KATEY.,"foreground, the only living thing in my misty-autumn picture; though,"
2522,KATEY.,"after all, you don’t look much more than a brown spot on the green, with"
2523,KATEY.,your brown hat and skirt and your old brown book.  I am much obliged to
2524,KATEY.,it for keeping you still so long this misty morning.  What is there in
2525,KATEY.,it?”
2526,KATEY.,
2527,KATEY.,"“Sketches,” I answered.  “Misty sketches like this of yours.”  And I"
2528,KATEY.,"stretched out my hand for my cousin’s drawing, while she looked over my"
2529,KATEY.,shoulder down on to the volume on my knee and uttered an exclamation of
2530,KATEY.,surprise when her eye fell on nothing but black letters on a damp spotted
2531,KATEY.,"yellow page.  “‘Treating of the four complexions, into which men are"
2532,KATEY.,"bound during their sojourn in their earthly houses,’” she read aloud;"
2533,KATEY.,“what does it mean?  Let me look on.  ‘Of those that draw their
2534,KATEY.,complexion from the dark and melancholy earth.  Of those who take their
2535,KATEY.,complexion from the friendly air.  Of those who are complexioned after
2536,KATEY.,the manner of fire.  Of those who partake of the nature of the subtle and
2537,KATEY.,yielding water;’ who writes this queer stuff; is it sense or nonsense?”
2538,KATEY.,I held up the book that she might read the faded gilt letters on its
2539,KATEY.,wormeaten leather back.  “Letters of Jacob Böhme to John Schauffman and
2540,KATEY.,"others,” she read.  “Oh!”—rather a doubtful “oh!” it was, as if the name"
2541,KATEY.,did not settle the question about sense or nonsense as completely as she
2542,KATEY.,had expected it would.
2543,KATEY.,
2544,KATEY.,"“This is rather a rare book I flatter myself,” I went on.  “I bought it"
2545,KATEY.,"at a book-stall because it looked so odd and old, and found to my great"
2546,KATEY.,"joy that it was a miscellaneous collection of Jacob Böhme’s letters, on"
2547,KATEY.,all sorts of subjects; the four that I have been reading this morning
2548,KATEY.,"about the four different temperaments, or, as he calls it, complexions"
2549,KATEY.,"into which men may be divided, come in oddly enough among much more"
2550,KATEY.,"mystical and transcendental matter.  They are, as I said, misty sketches"
2551,KATEY.,"of character, but I think they show that the dreamy old cobbler knew"
2552,KATEY.,something about his fellow-men.”

2556,KATEY.,"“Oh, I can’t tell you that, I can only tell you what it makes one feel"
2557,KATEY.,"like to read them.  Something, as we should feel, you and I, if we"
2558,KATEY.,"climbed up to that peak above the wood there, and looked down on the mist"
2559,KATEY.,in the valley now the sun is gilding it.  We should have a vague feeling
2560,KATEY.,"of having got up on to a height, and perceived something glorious; but we"
2561,KATEY.,should not be able to give much account of what we had seen when we came
2562,KATEY.,down.”
2563,KATEY.,
2564,KATEY.,_K._  “But I hope you will be able to give me an account of what you have
2565,KATEY.,been reading to-day.  I want you to explain to me about the four
2566,KATEY.,complexions as we walk home.”
2567,KATEY.,
2568,KATEY.,"“Well, I will try; these four letters have something in them that one can"
2569,KATEY.,"get hold of and venture to put into fresh words.  You must remember, to"
2570,KATEY.,"begin with, that Böhme still held to there being only four"
2571,KATEY.,"elements—earth, air, fire, and water—and thought that everything, our"
2572,KATEY.,"bodies included, was made up of various proportions of these elemental"
2573,KATEY.,"substances—the soul, a pure indivisible essence, he thinks of as living"
2574,KATEY.,imprisoned in these compound bodies.  Shadowed and clouded and hindered
2575,KATEY.,in its work by the material form that shuts it in from the true fount of
2576,KATEY.,"being; individualizing it and debasing it at the same time.  Character,"
2577,KATEY.,"according to him, depends upon the element that preponderates in the"
2578,KATEY.,composition of our bodies; our souls work through it and are more or less
2579,KATEY.,free.  His theory of the causes of differences of character may be ever
2580,KATEY.,"so foolish, yet I think the classification he draws from it is"
2581,KATEY.,"interesting, and does somehow or other help us to understand ourselves"
2582,KATEY.,and our fellow-creatures a little better.”
2583,KATEY.,
2584,KATEY.,"_K._  “Let me see, he divides people into earth, air, fire, and water"
2585,KATEY.,people.  What sort of character does he suppose the earth element colours
2586,KATEY.,the soul with?”
2587,KATEY.,
2588,KATEY.,"“You are quite right to use the word _colour_, Böhme thinks of the"
2589,KATEY.,"complexion, or, as we should say, the humour of a person, as of an"
2590,KATEY.,"independent _atmosphere_ through which the soul works, but which is no"
2591,KATEY.,part of it.  He speaks of souls shut up in the dark and melancholy earth
2592,KATEY.,"element; these are the silent, sensitive, brooding people, who find it"
2593,KATEY.,very difficult either to give out or receive impressions to or from their
2594,KATEY.,"fellow-creatures.  They are shut up, and as the earth (so at least Böhme"
2595,KATEY.,says) draws a great deal more heat and light from the sun than it ever
2596,KATEY.,"gives back, and darkly absorbs and stores up heat within itself, so these"
2597,KATEY.,"earth men and women, separated from their fellows, have the power of"
2598,KATEY.,drawing great enlightenment and deep warmth of love _direct_ from the
2599,KATEY.,spiritual source of light and love.  Religious enthusiasts are all of
2600,KATEY.,"this class; Böhme was an earth person himself, he says so; so was Dante"
2601,KATEY.,"and John Bunyan, and all the other people one reads of who have had"
2602,KATEY.,terrible experiences in the depths of their own souls and ecstatic
2603,KATEY.,visions to comfort them.  Böhme says that the very best and the very
2604,KATEY.,worst people are those shut in by the earth.  They are the most
2605,KATEY.,"_individual_, the most thoroughly separated; if conquering this"
2606,KATEY.,"hindrance, they re-absorb the Divine into themselves by _direct_ vision;"
2607,KATEY.,"they rise to heights of wisdom, love, and self-sacrifice that no other"
2608,KATEY.,souls can reach; but if by pride and self-will they cut themselves from
2609,KATEY.,"spiritual influences, they remain solitary, dark, hungry, always striving"
2610,KATEY.,vainly to extract the light and warmth they want from some one or two of
2611,KATEY.,"their fellow-creatures, and being constantly disappointed, because, not"
2612,KATEY.,"having the power of ray-ing out love, they can rarely attract it.  They"
2613,KATEY.,are eaten up by a sad dark egotism.  If they have a great deal of
2614,KATEY.,intellect they throw themselves vehemently into some one pursuit or
2615,KATEY.,"study, and become great but never happy.”"
2616,KATEY.,
2617,KATEY.,_K._  “I am thankful to say I don’t know any earth people.”
2618,KATEY.,
2619,KATEY.,"“Nor do I, pure earth, but I think I have come across one or two with a"
2620,KATEY.,touch of earth in their temperaments.  The air folk are much more common.
2621,KATEY.,"They are the eager inquisitive people, who want to get into everything"
2622,KATEY.,"and understand everything, just as the air pervades and permeates all"
2623,KATEY.,creation.  Great lovers of knowledge and scientific observers must always
2624,KATEY.,be air people.  Böhme thinks that in spite of their not being generally
2625,KATEY.,"very spiritual, they have the best chance of getting to heaven, because"
2626,KATEY.,of all classes they have most sympathy and are least shut up in
2627,KATEY.,"themselves, getting everywhere, like their element the air: they get into"
2628,KATEY.,the souls of others and understand them and live in them.  Their
2629,KATEY.,"influence is of a very peculiar kind; not being very individual, they"
2630,KATEY.,don’t impress the people round them with a strong sense of their
2631,KATEY.,"personality; they are not loved passionately, and they don’t love"
2632,KATEY.,"passionately, but people turn to them to be understood and helped, and"
2633,KATEY.,they are always benevolently ready to understand and help.  They are
2634,KATEY.,"satisfied that their influence should be breathed like the air, without"
2635,KATEY.,"being more recognized than the air: Shakespeare was, I expect, a typical"
2636,KATEY.,"_air_ man.  He had been everywhere, into all sorts of souls, peering"
2637,KATEY.,"about, and understanding them all, and how little any one seems to have"
2638,KATEY.,known about himself!  He was separated as little as possible from the
2639,KATEY.,universal fount of Being.”
2640,KATEY.,
2641,KATEY.,_K._  “Socrates was an air man too I suppose?  Your air people would be
2642,KATEY.,all philosophers.”
2643,KATEY.,
2644,KATEY.,“More or less lovers of knowledge they must be; but remember that
2645,KATEY.,"temperament does not affect the quality of the soul itself, it is only"
2646,KATEY.,"more or less of a hindrance.  The peculiar faults of air people are, as"
2647,KATEY.,"you will imagine, fickleness and coldness; their sympathy partakes of the"
2648,KATEY.,"nature of curiosity, and they easily adapt themselves to changes of"
2649,KATEY.,"circumstance; they can as easily live in one person as in another, and"
2650,KATEY.,the love of knowledge in little souls would degenerate into restless
2651,KATEY.,curiosity and fussiness.”
2652,KATEY.,
2653,KATEY.,_K._  “Would not Goethe be as good a type of the air temperament as
2654,KATEY.,"Shakespeare?  He certainly had the besetting faults of the complexion,"
2655,KATEY.,fickleness and coldness.”
2656,KATEY.,
2657,KATEY.,"“Yes, but the great influence he exercised over his contemporaries,"
2658,KATEY.,points to his drawing something too from the fire nature.”
2659,KATEY.,
2660,KATEY.,"_K._  “Those complexioned after the manner of the fire are, I suppose,"
2661,KATEY.,"the warm-hearted, affectionate souls?”"
2662,KATEY.,
2663,KATEY.,“Not at all; Böhme would not have consented to lay hold of such an
2664,KATEY.,obvious analogy.  He dives deeper into fire characteristics than to think
2665,KATEY.,chiefly of its warmth.  It is above all a consuming element; it takes
2666,KATEY.,"substances of all kinds and transmutes them into itself, a greedy"
2667,KATEY.,"devourer, reckless of the value of what it takes, intent only on"
2668,KATEY.,increasing and maintaining itself.  The fire people are the ambitious
2669,KATEY.,"conquerors and rulers of the world, who by the strength and attractive"
2670,KATEY.,warmth of their own natures force others to bend to them and become
2671,KATEY.,absorbed in their projects.  They are in reality as great egotists as the
2672,KATEY.,"earth people, only they don’t keep their egotism at smouldering fever"
2673,KATEY.,"heat in their own hearts; they let it blaze forth into a living flame,"
2674,KATEY.,"which draws weaker natures to be consumed in it, or at least forces them"
2675,KATEY.,"to live only in its heat and light.  Napoleon Bonaparte, I think, might"
2676,KATEY.,stand for a typical fire man.  In women the fire nature shows rather
2677,KATEY.,differently: pure fire women have acted very conspicuous parts in the
2678,KATEY.,"world’s history, and generally very disastrous ones, they are the women"
2679,KATEY.,who inspire great passions and feel very little themselves.  They draw
2680,KATEY.,others to them for the sake of homage to add to their own light.  Madame
2681,KATEY.,"de Chevreuse and Madame de Longueville must have been pure fire women, I"
2682,KATEY.,"should say.  Don’t suppose, however, that the fire, more than any other"
2683,KATEY.,"temperament, secures greatness or real superiority; it enables those who"
2684,KATEY.,follow its complexion to impress themselves more on other people than the
2685,KATEY.,"air spirits can, but their influence may be only temporary, and it may be"
2686,KATEY.,"very disagreeable, and in the end repelling.  Don’t you know people, both"
2687,KATEY.,"men and women, who have a mysterious way of making their will felt, and"
2688,KATEY.,who always count for something in whatever society they are in as long as
2689,KATEY.,"they are present, but who leave no permanent impression?  Those I suppose"
2690,KATEY.,"would be, according to Böhme, stupid souls acting through the fire"
2691,KATEY.,"temperament.  The influence of the air souls, inconspicuous as it is, is"
2692,KATEY.,more permanent.  Like the air it nourishes and changes without
2693,KATEY.,destroying; air people give more than they take.  Fire people take more
2694,KATEY.,than they give.”
2695,KATEY.,
2696,KATEY.,_K._  “And now what are the water followers?  I hope we are coming to
2697,KATEY.,"some amiable, pleasant people at last, for you have not described"
2698,KATEY.,anything very attractive yet.”
2699,KATEY.,
2700,KATEY.,"“I am afraid you will like the water complexion least of all, and be"
2701,KATEY.,obliged to acknowledge too that ‘the subtle and yielding water’ has more
2702,KATEY.,followers than any of the other elements.  The water element has a sort
2703,KATEY.,of resemblance to the air element; it mimics it without having its power.
2704,KATEY.,Water people are that large majority of mankind who have too weak a hold
2705,KATEY.,on life to be anything very distinctive of themselves.  They simulate
2706,KATEY.,"living and thinking, rather than really think and live.  Just as water"
2707,KATEY.,"receives impressions in itself that it cannot clasp and hold, that seem"
2708,KATEY.,to be part of it and are not.  They are easily influenced by others—by
2709,KATEY.,air people for example; but they only _image_ their thoughts in
2710,KATEY.,"themselves.  They look like them when they are with them, and when the"
2711,KATEY.,influence is removed they are empty like a lake when a veil of clouds is
2712,KATEY.,drawn over the sky.  The distinctive mark of water people is that they
2713,KATEY.,"are _self-conscious_, they are always thinking of themselves, because"
2714,KATEY.,they live a sort of double life—occupied not only with what they are
2715,KATEY.,doing but with the thought that they actually are doing it.
2716,KATEY.,Unconsciously they are continually acting a part.  They have notions
2717,KATEY.,about themselves and act up to them.  They see themselves in different
2718,KATEY.,"lights, and everything else as it concerns themselves.  Seeing not the"
2719,KATEY.,"real thing, but the thing reflected in themselves.  You must know such"
2720,KATEY.,"people, though they are difficult to describe, and I cannot just now"
2721,KATEY.,think of any historical typical water person to help out my description.
2722,KATEY.,Perhaps Napoleon the Third would do.  I think he must be what Böhme meant
2723,KATEY.,by ‘those who partake of the nature of the subtle and yielding nature;’
2724,KATEY.,"and, by the way, Böhme does not describe the water people as really"
2725,KATEY.,"yielding; on the contrary, he says they are very persistent.  In a slow,"
2726,KATEY.,"obstinate way, by seeming to yield and always returning to the point from"
2727,KATEY.,which they had been diverging (always finding their own level) they have
2728,KATEY.,more power than the followers of any of the other elements.”
2729,KATEY.,
2730,KATEY.,_K._  “Is there nothing good about these poor water creatures?  Have they
2731,KATEY.,no redeeming qualities?”
2732,KATEY.,
2733,KATEY.,“Oh yes!  The water temperament conduces to industry and perseverance.
2734,KATEY.,"Water men and women are very good imitators, not actors, and do most of"
2735,KATEY.,the second-rate work in the world.  They are not un-sympathizing.  Like
2736,KATEY.,"air people, they take in easily the thoughts and lives of others, only"
2737,KATEY.,they are always conscious of taking them in; they don’t lose themselves
2738,KATEY.,"in others, as it is possible for the air followers to do.  While they"
2739,KATEY.,"sympathize, they think how nice it is to be sympathetic; or, if they are"
2740,KATEY.,"women, perhaps the thought is how interesting I look while I am listening"
2741,KATEY.,to this sad story.”
2742,KATEY.,
2743,KATEY.,"_K._  “Come now, I believe you have some particular water person in your"
2744,KATEY.,"mind, for you are getting satirical.  It is well we are nearly home."
2745,KATEY.,"What I can’t understand is, why all the four complexions have so much"
2746,KATEY.,that is disagreeable in them.  In which class would Böhme put really good
2747,KATEY.,and noble people?”
2748,KATEY.,
2749,KATEY.,“They might come into any one of the four classes.  You must remember
2750,KATEY.,that according to Böhme the temperament is an outer material atmosphere
2751,KATEY.,"surrounding the soul, and of necessity partly evil, because it is"
2752,KATEY.,"material; the pure soul has to work through it, and conquer it, according"
2753,KATEY.,to Böhme.”

2958,THINGS GONE BY.,"To be standing still, and to have a panorama constantly moving by one,"

2960,THINGS GONE BY.,"kindly friends, pleasant meetings, wise speeches, noble acts, stirring"

2962,THINGS GONE BY.,"river and sun, and shade and trees, and cottages and labouring men and"
2963,THINGS GONE BY.,"grazing cattle; to have all things moving by one, and oneself to stagnate"
2964,THINGS GONE BY.,"and alone to be left behind, as all else moves on to greet the young, the"
2965,THINGS GONE BY.,"hopeful, and the untried,—there is indeed something sad in this.  We have"
2966,THINGS GONE BY.,seen these good and beautiful and soul-touching visions once.  They
2967,THINGS GONE BY.,charmed and entranced us as they lingered with us for a few brief and
2968,THINGS GONE BY.,"blissful moments, but they have gone by and left us alone.  We shall"
2969,THINGS GONE BY.,"never look upon them again.  Yes, it is bitter—too bitter almost for man"
2970,THINGS GONE BY.,"to dwell upon much.  He must turn elsewhere, and try to bury the past in"
2971,THINGS GONE BY.,"forgetfulness, gazing on the new visions as they in turn pass by him,"
2972,THINGS GONE BY.,"knowing that their time is short, and that they too, like all the old"
2973,THINGS GONE BY.,"ones, will very soon be as though they were not."
2974,THINGS GONE BY.,
2975,THINGS GONE BY.,"But it is not so.  Man is passing the world by, and not the world man."
2976,THINGS GONE BY.,"Man is passing on, year after year, in his magnificent and irresistible"
2977,THINGS GONE BY.,"course, never losing, and ever gaining.  All he sees, and knows, and"
2978,THINGS GONE BY.,"feels, and does becomes an inseparable part of himself, far more closely"
2979,THINGS GONE BY.,"bound up with his life and nature than even his flesh, and nerves, and"
2980,THINGS GONE BY.,"bones.  It is not merely that he remembers the past and loves the past,"
2981,THINGS GONE BY.,but he is the past; and he is more the whole assembly of the past than he
2982,THINGS GONE BY.,is anything else whatever.  Man alone moves onward to perfection and to
2983,THINGS GONE BY.,"happiness, as a universe stands still ministering to his lordly progress."
2984,THINGS GONE BY.,"Even the life, the passions, and the personal progress of each particular"
2985,THINGS GONE BY.,"man stand still, as it were, in the service of all the rest, and become"

2998,THINGS GONE BY.,"remembrance, a piquancy of flavour that is almost agreeable.  I suppose"
2999,THINGS GONE BY.,"the habit of most of us who have attained a certain, or rather uncertain"
3000,THINGS GONE BY.,"age, is to revel in the past, to endure the present, and to let the"
3001,THINGS GONE BY.,future look after itself.
3002,THINGS GONE BY.,
3003,THINGS GONE BY.,"Now this is all well enough for the sentimentalist, or for the poet who,"
3004,THINGS GONE BY.,"like Bulwer, can write at thirty “on the departure of youth.”  But to the"
3005,THINGS GONE BY.,"philosopher—that is, of course, to each member of “Pen and"
3006,THINGS GONE BY.,Pencil”—another and more useful tone of mind and method of comparison
3007,THINGS GONE BY.,should not be absent.  Is not the present what was the future to the

3009,THINGS GONE BY.,"also with what was the aspiration of the past, throw some light, borrowed"
3010,THINGS GONE BY.,"though it be, on what will be the present to our descendants?  Mr."
3011,THINGS GONE BY.,Pecksniff observes: “It is a poor heart that never rejoices.”  Let us
3012,THINGS GONE BY.,"manifest our wealth—of imagination, shall I say?—by endeavouring to"
3013,THINGS GONE BY.,"realize how, through the falsehood and wickedness of the past, we have"
3014,THINGS GONE BY.,arrived at our own lofty and noble eminence.
3015,THINGS GONE BY.,
3016,THINGS GONE BY.,"When we read, in the blood-stained pages of history, of nations and"
3017,THINGS GONE BY.,continents plunged into warfare of the most horrible and heartrending
3018,THINGS GONE BY.,"description, at the call of national glory or dynastic ambition, how can"
3019,THINGS GONE BY.,we sufficiently rejoice at the soft accents of peace and happiness which
3020,THINGS GONE BY.,none would now venture to interrupt over the length and breadth of happy
3021,THINGS GONE BY.,Europe?
3022,THINGS GONE BY.,
3023,THINGS GONE BY.,The age of falsehood and party spirit may be said to have passed away.
3024,THINGS GONE BY.,"Our newspapers tell nothing but truth, and the only difference"
3025,THINGS GONE BY.,"perceptible in their mild criticisms of friend or foe, is that they"
3026,THINGS GONE BY.,betray a generous tendency to do more than justice to their enemies.
3027,THINGS GONE BY.,
3028,THINGS GONE BY.,"If we cannot say that pauperism is extinct, yet we can honestly affirm"
3029,THINGS GONE BY.,"that, if we cannot destroy the accursed thing itself, yet we can, and do"
3030,THINGS GONE BY.,"so deal with paupers that the weakest, at least, soon cease to be a"
3031,THINGS GONE BY.,"burden on the rates.  Science and humanity have shaken hands, and the"
3032,THINGS GONE BY.,soft persuasions of chemical compounds are employed to assist down any
3033,THINGS GONE BY.,unhappy girl who should be betrayed into aspirations towards the
3034,THINGS GONE BY.,chimney-pot.  We all know that gluttony is one of the greatest evils in
3035,THINGS GONE BY.,"the world, and which of our hearts could be hard enough not to glow with"
3036,THINGS GONE BY.,"rapture at the benevolent rule of a London Union, mentioned in to-day’s"
3037,THINGS GONE BY.,"paper, of never giving their inmates anything to tax their digestive"
3038,THINGS GONE BY.,forces between 5 P.M. and 8 A.M.
3039,THINGS GONE BY.,
3040,THINGS GONE BY.,"Again, when we read in our “Spectators” or other venerable records of the"
3041,THINGS GONE BY.,"follies of fashion of 150 years ago, or indeed of any other epoch we like"
3042,THINGS GONE BY.,"to recur to—of hoops and paint, and patches—how may we rejoice at the"
3043,THINGS GONE BY.,"greater wisdom of our ladies in these days, in recognizing how"
3044,THINGS GONE BY.,"beautifully they blend the tasteful with the useful!  Their crinoline,"
3045,THINGS GONE BY.,"how Grecian in its elegance; their chignons, how intellectual in"
3046,THINGS GONE BY.,"appearance; their bonnets, how well calculated to protect from rain and"
3047,THINGS GONE BY.,"sun; their trains, how cleanly; their boot-heels, how well calculated to"
3048,THINGS GONE BY.,produce by natural means what the barbarian Chinese seek by coarser
3049,THINGS GONE BY.,"methods—to deform the foot, and thus, by limiting their power of walking,"
3050,THINGS GONE BY.,to leave them more time for high intellectual culture.
3051,THINGS GONE BY.,
3052,THINGS GONE BY.,"Of the improvement in our social morals it is needless to speak, and"
3053,THINGS GONE BY.,"indeed I must decline to do so, if only that in drawing a comparison I"
3054,THINGS GONE BY.,should have to shock the ears of “Pen and Pencil” with some allusions to
3055,THINGS GONE BY.,_things gone by_.  I will but casually refer to two salient
3056,THINGS GONE BY.,characteristics of the enormities of bygone times—to novels and to the
3057,THINGS GONE BY.,theatre.  Compare but for a moment the wild and almost licentious
3058,THINGS GONE BY.,"writings of a Walter Scott, an Edgeworth, or an Austen with the pure and"
3059,THINGS GONE BY.,"unexaggerated novels of the present halcyon time.  And for our theatres,"
3060,THINGS GONE BY.,if it be possible to imagine anything more chaste and elevating than the
3061,THINGS GONE BY.,"existing drama—anything more stimulating to all that is purest, more"
3062,THINGS GONE BY.,repressive of all that is vulgar and low in our ballets or
3063,THINGS GONE BY.,"pantomimes—why, I very much mistake the realities that lie before us."
3064,THINGS GONE BY.,
3065,THINGS GONE BY.,"Finally, in the religion of the country—there where one looks for the"
3066,THINGS GONE BY.,summing up and climax as it were of all the incidental advances we have
3067,THINGS GONE BY.,"glanced at, how glorious is the spectacle!  The fopperies of"
3068,THINGS GONE BY.,ecclesiastical upholstery banished from the land; the hardness and
3069,THINGS GONE BY.,cruelty of dogmatic intolerance heard no more; a noble life everywhere
3070,THINGS GONE BY.,more honoured than an orthodox belief.
3071,THINGS GONE BY.,
3072,THINGS GONE BY.,"Surely we have reached the Promised Land—it overflows with charity, with"

3277,EXILE.,With oblivion brought relief;

3279,EXILE.,Smoothing the brow of grief.
3280,EXILE.,
3281,EXILE.,Through a dungeon’s narrow grating
3282,EXILE.,The slanting moonlight fell
3283,EXILE.,"Down by a careworn prisoner,"
3284,EXILE.,Asleep in his lonely cell.

3286,EXILE.,"Had grasp’d a sword ere now,"
3287,EXILE.,And the lips now parch’d with fever
3288,EXILE.,Had utter’d a patriot’s vow.
3289,EXILE.,
3290,EXILE.,"He stirr’d and the silence was broken,"
3291,EXILE.,"By the clanking of a chain,"
3292,EXILE.,"He sigh’d, but the sigh no longer,"
3293,EXILE.,Show’d the spirit’s restless pain.
3294,EXILE.,"For to him the dark walls faded,"
3295,EXILE.,And the prisoner stood once more
3296,EXILE.,"Beneath the vine-wreath’d trellis,"
3297,EXILE.,Beside his loved home’s door.
3298,EXILE.,
3299,EXILE.,And memory drew the faces
3300,EXILE.,"So dear in earlier days,"
3301,EXILE.,Of the sisters who were with him
3302,EXILE.,"Joining in childish plays,"
3303,EXILE.,And the mother whose lips first murmured

3310,EXILE.,"And the vow they had vowed together,"
3311,EXILE.,Grasping each other’s hand.
3312,EXILE.,"He dreamt of the first resistance,"
3313,EXILE.,Of the one who basely fled;
3314,EXILE.,And the guard’s o’erwhelming numbers
3315,EXILE.,And the hopes of life all dead.

3323,EXILE.,What tidings of home and kindred

3330,EXILE.,"Of the hearts that throbbed exulting,"

3332,EXILE.,Of the sigh which fell unheeded
3333,EXILE.,To the thought of child and wife.
3334,EXILE.,
3335,EXILE.,"And he dreamt of the day of contest,"
3336,EXILE.,"Of whistling shot and shell,"
3337,EXILE.,"When he bore his country’s banner,"
3338,EXILE.,And had borne it high and well.
3339,EXILE.,“Rally for Freedom!  Forward!

3357,EXILE.,"“Welcome,” they said, “we await thee;"

3361,EXILE.,
3362,EXILE.,"Was it a dream, or delusion?"
3363,EXILE.,Or vision?  Who shall say?
3364,EXILE.,Its spell consoled the hours
3365,EXILE.,Of many a weary day.
3366,EXILE.,"And months went slowly over,"
3367,EXILE.,And the winter’s icy breath

3394,EXILE.,
3395,EXILE.,And from my chilly watch aloft

3416,EXILE.,An utter want of prog.
3417,EXILE.,"Another would have reeved a rope,"
3418,EXILE.,And made himself a necklace;
3419,EXILE.,"My wreck bereaved me of my hope,"
3420,EXILE.,But did not leave me reckless.
3421,EXILE.,

3444,EXILE.,"_Three_, did I say? there are but two,"

3446,EXILE.,"Has been my stay the winter through,"
3447,EXILE.,And now is turning rancid.
3448,EXILE.,
3449,EXILE.,The cruel frost has nipped me some;

3451,EXILE.,"Upon a solitary thumb,"
3452,EXILE.,And half a middle finger.
3453,EXILE.,"In toto I have lost my toes,"

3456,EXILE.,Above the freezing point.
3457,EXILE.,
3458,EXILE.,Upon this floe of ice my tears

3467,EXILE.,Until some Gulf-Stream vagaries

3596,REALITIES.,"I AM informed by “Pen and Pencil,” with a certain harsh inexorableness of"
3597,REALITIES.,"tone, that _something_ I must produce this evening, or—incur a sentence"
3598,REALITIES.,"too dreadful to be contemplated, no less than that of ostracism (perhaps"
3599,REALITIES.,ostracism for incapacity should be spelt _ass_tracism).
3600,REALITIES.,
3601,REALITIES.,"Well, what are the words?  _Realities_ and _drifting_.  Very good; then"
3602,REALITIES.,"I’ll take both, for the most characteristic element that I have noted of"
3603,REALITIES.,_realities_ is that they are constantly _drifting_.
3604,REALITIES.,
3605,REALITIES.,"Wishing to start from an undoubted basis, I asked a friend, before"
3606,REALITIES.,"sitting down to write, what exactly he understood by _realities_, and he"
3607,REALITIES.,"replied, with the air of a philosopher, “whatever man, through the medium"
3608,REALITIES.,"of his senses, can surely realize.”  The conclusion I draw is, that there"
3609,REALITIES.,is some inextricable connection between _realities_ and _real lies_.  In
3610,REALITIES.,"which I am confirmed by Johnson, who traces the derivation of the word"
3611,REALITIES.,_reality_ as _from_ real.
3612,REALITIES.,
3613,REALITIES.,"Sir John Lubbock, in his “Origin of Civilization,” under the heading of"
3614,REALITIES.,"“Savage Tendency to Deification,” states as a fact that “The king of the"
3615,REALITIES.,"Koussa Kaffirs, having broken off a piece of a stranded anchor, died soon"
3616,REALITIES.,"afterwards, upon which all the Kaffirs looked upon the anchor as alive,"
3617,REALITIES.,and saluted it respectfully whenever they passed near it.”  At a glance
3618,REALITIES.,"it occurred to me, this is a _reality_ well worthy of being brought under"
3619,REALITIES.,"the notice of “Pen and Pencil.”  Will it not furnish, thought I, material"
3620,REALITIES.,"for their philosophers, and mirth for their humorists, and surely an"
3621,REALITIES.,"excellent subject for their artists?  _But is it true_?  Ay, that must be"
3622,REALITIES.,my first discovery.  Who shall hope to palm off doubtful _realities_ upon
3623,REALITIES.,"“Pen and Pencil,” without deservedly _drifting_ to disgrace?"
3624,REALITIES.,
3625,REALITIES.,"Without indecent boasting, I believe I may assure this august assembly"
3626,REALITIES.,that I have probed this matter to its very root; the whole truth is in my
3627,REALITIES.,"hands, and shall be faithfully presented to this critical company.  I"
3628,REALITIES.,shall be excused from detailing my method of examination; time would fail
3629,REALITIES.,us were I to make the attempt; suffice it to say that I have brought all
3630,REALITIES.,"possible modes under contribution, and many more, and that not a single"
3631,REALITIES.,fact has been set down unless previously tested by a wild flight of
3632,REALITIES.,"imagination.  Upon principle, too, I decline to say how I have arrived at"
3633,REALITIES.,"the realities of the case, lest truth should suffer through disapproval"
3634,REALITIES.,of my process.
3635,REALITIES.,
3636,REALITIES.,"If I say that I have telegraphed direct, some wretched caviller may"
3637,REALITIES.,observe that he never heard of Kaffir wires.  I may have conversed with
3638,REALITIES.,the ghost of the wicked king of Koussa Kaffir through the medium of Mrs.
3639,REALITIES.,"Marshall, but some joker—how I do detest the race—might object to my plan"
3640,REALITIES.,of _marshalling_ my facts.  I may have “asked that solemn question” of
3641,REALITIES.,"the leg of my loo-table, which does _not_ by any means “seem eternal,”"
3642,REALITIES.,something after the fashion of Ion.  I may have caught the little toe of
3643,REALITIES.,"Mr. Home, as he was floating in mid-air, and so found my information, as"
3644,REALITIES.,"honest debts should be paid, _on the nail_.  I may have—but no more—I"
3645,REALITIES.,"respectfully decline to communicate, to-night at least, aught but the"
3646,REALITIES.,ascertained _realities_.
3647,REALITIES.,
3648,REALITIES.,"It is true, then, that a stranded anchor was thrown on the shore of"
3649,REALITIES.,Koussa Kaffir; that it created widespread wonder and inquiry as to its
3650,REALITIES.,"whence, its wherefore, and its whither; that the king, being of an"
3651,REALITIES.,"inquiring mind, often examined the anchor, pondered over its shape and"
3652,REALITIES.,"its materials; that one day, testing this last with too much energy, one"
3653,REALITIES.,"fluke was quite lopped off.  His majesty was pleased with the result,"
3654,REALITIES.,although it did not seem to do much towards solving the difficult
3655,REALITIES.,questions connected with the strange visitor; but it was afterwards
3656,REALITIES.,generally reported that some of the wisest of the Kaffirs had shaken
3657,REALITIES.,"their heads three times, and had remarked that if anything should happen"
3658,REALITIES.,they should doubt whether it was not for something.
3659,REALITIES.,
3660,REALITIES.,Something did happen.  The king that night ate for his supper forty-four
3661,REALITIES.,"ostrich eggs, beside two kangaroos and a missionary.  It was too much for"
3662,REALITIES.,"even a Kaffir king; he was seized with nightmare, raved of the weight of"
3663,REALITIES.,"the anchor on his chest, and died."
3664,REALITIES.,
3665,REALITIES.,"The effect produced upon Kaffir public opinion, and the Kaffir press, was"
3666,REALITIES.,startling and instantaneous.  The king had broken the anchor; the king
3667,REALITIES.,"had died—had died _because_ he broke the anchor; that was evident, nay"
3668,REALITIES.,"was proved—proved by unerring figures, as thus: the king was fifty-five"
3669,REALITIES.,"years old; had lived, that is to say, 20,075 days; to say, therefore,"
3670,REALITIES.,that he had not died this day _because_ of his daring impiety was more
3671,REALITIES.,"than 20,000 to one against the doctrine of probabilities."
3672,REALITIES.,
3673,REALITIES.,"The anchor, therefore, was a power—was a devil to be feared—that is, a"
3674,REALITIES.,god to be worshipped; for in savage countries there is a wonderful
3675,REALITIES.,likeness between the two.  Thus was born a religion in Koussa Kaffir.
3676,REALITIES.,Divine honours or dastard fears were lavished on the anchor; a priesthood
3677,REALITIES.,sprang up who made their account in the Kaffir superstition.  They were
3678,REALITIES.,"called anchorites.  They were partly cheats, and partly dupes; but they"
3679,REALITIES.,made a livelihood between the two characters.  They fixed the nature and
3680,REALITIES.,"the amount of the sacrifices to be offered, and the requirements of the"
3681,REALITIES.,anchor were in remarkable harmony with the wants of its priests.  Natural
3682,REALITIES.,"causes, too, were happily blended with supernatural.  The anchor was"
3683,REALITIES.,declared to be the great healer of diseases.  For immense sums the
3684,REALITIES.,"ministering priests would give small filings to the diseased, and"
3685,REALITIES.,"marvellous were the cures produced by oxides and by iron; never, in"
3686,REALITIES.,"short, was there a more prosperous faith.  The morals of the people, I"
3687,REALITIES.,"grieve to say, did not improve in proportion to their faith.  An anchor"
3688,REALITIES.,that is supposed to remit sins on sacerdotal intercession is probably not
3689,REALITIES.,favourable to the higher morals in Koussa Kaffir.
3690,REALITIES.,
3691,REALITIES.,But a trial had to come upon the anchor-devil and its worshippers.  Under
3692,REALITIES.,"it it must collapse, or passing through it as through the flame of"
3693,REALITIES.,"persecution, come forth stronger and brighter than ever.  Which should it"
3694,REALITIES.,be?  It was an interesting spectacle.  Let me finish my story.
3695,REALITIES.,
3696,REALITIES.,There returned to Koussa Kaffir a native who had voyaged round the world
3697,REALITIES.,since he had left his native land; he had seen and had observed much; he
3698,REALITIES.,was well acquainted with anchors; had seen them in all stages and under
3699,REALITIES.,all conditions; he knew their use by long experience; he had handled
3700,REALITIES.,"them.  One time his vessel had been saved by its stout anchor, another"
3701,REALITIES.,time he had had to save the ship by slipping his cable and leaving the
3702,REALITIES.,anchor at the bottom; he had never known an anchor resent the worst
3703,REALITIES.,"usage; he would not worship this old broken one.  Some thought him mad,"
3704,REALITIES.,"some wicked; he was called infidel by those who knew his mind, but for a"
3705,REALITIES.,"long time he followed his friends’ advice, and said nothing of his awful"
3706,REALITIES.,heresy.
3707,REALITIES.,
3708,REALITIES.,But this condition of mind would hardly last for ever.  Travel had
3709,REALITIES.,"improved his intellectual force, as well as given special knowledge about"
3710,REALITIES.,anchors and other things; he began to lament over and even to despise the
3711,REALITIES.,folly of his race; he burned to cast off some at least of their shackles
3712,REALITIES.,"of ignorance and superstition.  “How shall I begin,” cried he one day,"
3713,REALITIES.,"“to raise their souls to something higher, while they worship that stupid"
3714,REALITIES.,old rusty anchor in the sand?”
3715,REALITIES.,
3716,REALITIES.,His soul began to burn with the spirit of martyrs and reformers.  “I will
3717,REALITIES.,"expose this folly; I will break to pieces their anchor-devil, and when"
3718,REALITIES.,"they see that all is well as it was before, they will begin to laugh at"
3719,REALITIES.,"their own devil, and will have their minds open to a higher faith.”"
3720,REALITIES.,
3721,REALITIES.,But first he would consult his friends; if possible obtain their
3722,REALITIES.,"sanction, and act in unison with others.  He met with no encouragement."
3723,REALITIES.,"One gravely rebuked him for his presumption and conceit, and produced a"
3724,REALITIES.,long list of eminent Kaffirs who had bowed before the anchor.  Another
3725,REALITIES.,found in the absurdity of the anchor faith its best evidence of solidity.
3726,REALITIES.,"It was, he said, a faith too improbable for a Kaffir to have invented;"
3727,REALITIES.,"any fool, he added, could believe a probable religion, but it needed a"
3728,REALITIES.,superior Kaffir to swallow this.  Some put their tongues in their cheeks
3729,REALITIES.,"(a vulgar habit amongst the Koussa Kaffirs), and said: “Silly fellow, we"
3730,REALITIES.,"know all that as well as you do, but the anchor is a profitable anchor,"
3731,REALITIES.,"and as needs must, you shall be one amongst the priests.”"
3732,REALITIES.,
3733,REALITIES.,"Again, others said: “We, too, have our doubts, but as a political engine"
3734,REALITIES.,we must retain our anchor.  How should we keep down the lower orders?
3735,REALITIES.,How restrain our servants from pilfering without its influence and
3736,REALITIES.,"sanctifying power?  The fact is, that in our complicated social system"
3737,REALITIES.,"all society depends upon the anchor.”  “Between ourselves,” one added,"
3738,REALITIES.,“if heaven had not sent that particular anchor some of us think we must
3739,REALITIES.,have sent to Woolwich for another.”
3740,REALITIES.,
3741,REALITIES.,"But the only arguments that caused him any hesitation, and which did give"
3742,REALITIES.,"him some pain, were from certain women who implored him not to destroy"
3743,REALITIES.,"their anchor idol.  “We cannot judge,” said one of these, “between your"
3744,REALITIES.,arguments and the conclusions we have been brought up to reverence.  The
3745,REALITIES.,"anchor may not be a god but only a symbol, but how beautiful a one!  Does"
3746,REALITIES.,"not the anchor save the ship?  And are not our own lives, too, like the"
3747,REALITIES.,"storm-tossed vessel?  That anchor is associated with all we have felt,"
3748,REALITIES.,"suffered, prayed for.  Destroy that symbol, and you wound and endanger"
3749,REALITIES.,the deepest element of religion in our hearts.”
3750,REALITIES.,
3751,REALITIES.,"Finally, one very intelligent friend said to him with much solemnity:"
3752,REALITIES.,"“Rash man, forbear!  Stop while there is time in a course that may bring"
3753,REALITIES.,"down ruin on the State and on yourself, and for the doing of which you"
3754,REALITIES.,"can have, as a rational being, no temptation whatever.  I grant you you"
3755,REALITIES.,"may be right, and the rest all wrong; but what then?  We can know nothing"
3756,REALITIES.,"of the matter, and _you may be wrong_.  Now, anyhow, _we are on the safe"
3757,REALITIES.,"side of the hedge_.  If the anchor be a devil he may do you harm, and if"
3758,REALITIES.,"he be only a bit of rusty iron, you will be none the worse for a bow and"
3759,REALITIES.,a grimace.”
3760,REALITIES.,
3761,REALITIES.,The rash man was immovable.  Doomed by the infernal gods to pay the
3762,REALITIES.,"penalty of having lit his Promethean torch at Woolwich dockyard, armed"
3763,REALITIES.,"with a mighty hammer, and followed by an awe-struck crowd, he fell upon"
3764,REALITIES.,"the anchor, and with one mighty blow, struck off the other fluke.  It was"
3765,REALITIES.,"his last!  Inspired by religious zeal, the Koussa Kaffirs rushed upon"
3766,REALITIES.,"him, and in the sight of the outraged anchor beat his brains out on the"
3767,REALITIES.,beach.  It was observed that his friend who liked to be “on the safe
3768,REALITIES.,"side” threw the first stone, and the advocate of public morals was the"
3769,REALITIES.,next; after that they rained too thick to tell who did the most.
3770,REALITIES.,
3771,REALITIES.,Meantime the anchor of Koussa Kaffir will be worshipped for a thousand
3772,REALITIES.,"years, for has it not slain the only two men who dared to question its"
3773,REALITIES.,authority?

4107,SWALLOWS.,"A NEW season is begun.  Parliament met to-day.  London is getting full,"
4108,SWALLOWS.,and the price of coals has fallen.  The celandine (swallow-flower) is
4109,SWALLOWS.,beginning to cover the hedgerow banks of the Isle of Wight with yellow
4110,SWALLOWS.,"stars, and the swallows themselves will soon be with us again."
4111,SWALLOWS.,
4112,SWALLOWS.,I may mention as another agreeable sign of spring the return of “Pen and
4113,SWALLOWS.,"Pencil,” not to the old nest, but under shelter of the old hospitality."
4114,SWALLOWS.,
4115,SWALLOWS.,The Rhodians used to salute the return of the swallows with a traditional
4116,SWALLOWS.,"popular song, the _Chelidonisma_; perhaps some lady present may gratify"
4117,SWALLOWS.,us with a chant of the like purport.  My own aim this evening is merely
4118,SWALLOWS.,"to give some brief natural history notes on the British swallows, drawn"
4119,SWALLOWS.,partly from books and partly from my own observation.
4120,SWALLOWS.,
4121,SWALLOWS.,"There are about sixty species of the family of Hirundinidæ, but only four"
4122,SWALLOWS.,kinds (counting the swift as one) are habitual visitors of the British
4123,SWALLOWS.,"Islands—the chimney swallow, the house martin, the bank martin (_Hirundo"
4124,SWALLOWS.,"rustica_, _urbica_, and _riparia_), and fourthly the swift (_Cypselus_)."
4125,SWALLOWS.,
4126,SWALLOWS.,"The chimney swallow (_rustica_) has a brownish-red throat, back of"
4127,SWALLOWS.,"blue-black lustre, under part of body reddish-white, and a long forked"
4128,SWALLOWS.,"tail.  It is a bold bird, and trusting to its superior speed, dashes at a"
4129,SWALLOWS.,"hawk whenever it sees one.  It always builds near men, and makes its"
4130,SWALLOWS.,"cup-shaped nest inside chimneys and old wells, in barns, gateways, sheds,"
4131,SWALLOWS.,"and arches of bridges.  There are four or five spotted eggs, and it"
4132,SWALLOWS.,brings out two broods each year.  The chimney swallow has a sweet little
4133,SWALLOWS.,"song of its own, and is one of the earliest birds heard of a summer"
4134,SWALLOWS.,"morning, beginning soon after two o’clock.  It is said to grow very tame"
4135,SWALLOWS.,"in confinement, but I never saw and should not like to see one in a cage."
4136,SWALLOWS.,"These are the most abundant of our swallows, and the same birds return"
4137,SWALLOWS.,"year after year, while their little time endures, to the same localities,"
4138,SWALLOWS.,and often very likely to the same nests.
4139,SWALLOWS.,
4140,SWALLOWS.,"The house martin (_urbica_), or window swallow or martlet, is smaller and"
4141,SWALLOWS.,"less agile than its cousin just described, and has a far shorter tail."
4142,SWALLOWS.,"Its feet and toes are downy.  It comes later than the chimney swallow,"
4143,SWALLOWS.,"builds amidst towns, on the _outside_ of houses, under eaves and in"
4144,SWALLOWS.,"window niches, and chooses a northern aspect to avoid the direct rays of"
4145,SWALLOWS.,"the sun, which would crack its mud nest.  Martlets sometimes build on the"
4146,SWALLOWS.,"face of cliffs, as may be seen at the Giant’s Causeway.  It has four or"
4147,SWALLOWS.,"five _white_ eggs, and brings out two broods.  As a vocalist it can only"
4148,SWALLOWS.,"get as far as a chirp, or at most a small twitter.  Its body is white"
4149,SWALLOWS.,"below, and purple on the back and wings.  The house martin does not, like"
4150,SWALLOWS.,"the chimney swallow, sweep the ground and water in its flight."
4151,SWALLOWS.,
4152,SWALLOWS.,"The bank swallow (_riparian_) or sand martin, which is so sociable with"
4153,SWALLOWS.,"its own kind but not with man, digs horizontal and serpentine holes in"
4154,SWALLOWS.,"banks, sloping upwards to avoid rain, where it lays in a careless nest"
4155,SWALLOWS.,"four or six white eggs.  It has sometimes, but perhaps not always, two"
4156,SWALLOWS.,"broods.  These are the smallest and wildest of our swallows; nearly mute,"
4157,SWALLOWS.,"or with only a tiny chirp; and, when they can, frequent large spaces of"
4158,SWALLOWS.,"water.  They often fly waveringly with a quick fluttering of wings,"
4159,SWALLOWS.,"somewhat like butterflies, and anon sail circling like other swallows."
4160,SWALLOWS.,"They use their old caves for some years, but may often be seen digging"
4161,SWALLOWS.,"new ones.  They are probably driven out sometimes by the fleas which, as"
4162,SWALLOWS.,"I have often seen, abound in their habitations.  Birds, indeed, free and"
4163,SWALLOWS.,"airy as their life seems, suffer much from vermin, and the poor baby"
4164,SWALLOWS.,swallows are terribly preyed upon.  The sand martin is mouse-coloured on
4165,SWALLOWS.,the back and brownish-white below.  It is the earliest to arrive in
4166,SWALLOWS.,"England, and may be expected now in three weeks or so.  Next we may look"
4167,SWALLOWS.,"for the chimney swallow with his long tail—then for the house martin, and"
4168,SWALLOWS.,"latest of all comes the swift (_Cypselus_), which some naturalists say is"
4169,SWALLOWS.,"no true swallow, having several anatomical peculiarities, the most"
4170,SWALLOWS.,"noticeable being that all four toes go forward.  No other bird, I think"
4171,SWALLOWS.,"(save the Gibraltar swift), has a similar foot.  The swift can cling well"
4172,SWALLOWS.,"to the face of a wall, but cannot perch in the usual bird fashion, and"
4173,SWALLOWS.,"gets on very badly on the ground, finding it difficult to rise on the"
4174,SWALLOWS.,"wing.  Once in the air, with its long wings in motion, it is truly master"
4175,SWALLOWS.,"of the situation.  It is one of the speediest, if not the speediest, and"
4176,SWALLOWS.,"can keep on the wing for sixteen hours, which is longer than any other"
4177,SWALLOWS.,bird.  The swifts are most active in sultry thundery weather.  They fly
4178,SWALLOWS.,"in rain, but dislike wind.  They are the latest day-birds in summer, and"
4179,SWALLOWS.,their one very shrill note may be heard up to nearly nine o’clock.
4180,SWALLOWS.,"Sometimes they get excited and dart about screaming, perhaps quarrelling,"
4181,SWALLOWS.,"but usually the swallows, all of them, agree well among themselves,"
4182,SWALLOWS.,though they also keep a proper distance.  The swifts build high in holes
4183,SWALLOWS.,of walls and rocks.  The Tower of London is one of their London palaces.
4184,SWALLOWS.,The nest is bulky and has two white eggs.  There is but one brood in the
4185,SWALLOWS.,"season, and the swift leaves town for Africa in August, going earliest,"
4186,SWALLOWS.,although he was the latest to come.
4187,SWALLOWS.,
4188,SWALLOWS.,Swallows for several weeks after their arrival in England play about
4189,SWALLOWS.,before beginning their nests—
4190,SWALLOWS.,
4191,SWALLOWS.,“Like children coursing every room
4192,SWALLOWS.,Of some new house.”
4193,SWALLOWS.,
4194,SWALLOWS.,"They wait for fit weather to go away, and may then be seen sitting in"
4195,SWALLOWS.,"rows as though meditating on their journey, perhaps dimly sorry to part—"
4196,SWALLOWS.,
4197,SWALLOWS.,"“With a birdish trouble, half-perplexed.”"
4198,SWALLOWS.,
4199,SWALLOWS.,Utterly mysterious and inscrutable to us are the feelings of our lower
4200,SWALLOWS.,"fellow-creatures on this earth, and how the bird of passage,"
4201,SWALLOWS.,"“lone-wandering but not lost,” finds its distant goal, is beyond man’s"
4202,SWALLOWS.,wit to explain.
4203,SWALLOWS.,
4204,SWALLOWS.,"After this I fear tedious sketch of our four winged friends, I will only"
4205,SWALLOWS.,"add another word or two as to the name swallow, a rather odd word,"
4206,SWALLOWS.,"entirely different from the Greek _χελῖδών_, and the Latin _hirundo_"
4207,SWALLOWS.,"(which, unlike as it may appear, philologists tell us is formed from the"
4208,SWALLOWS.,Greek name).  The Italians call the bird _rondine_ (evidently from the
4209,SWALLOWS.,"Latin), and the French _hirondelle_.  We get our word from the"
4210,SWALLOWS.,"Anglo-Saxon, _swalewe_, and the modern German is _schwalbe_.  What does"
4211,SWALLOWS.,this mean?  I must own with regret that it seems to me most likely that
4212,SWALLOWS.,"the name is given on account of the voracity of this bird, which is"
4213,SWALLOWS.,"engaged in swallowing gnats, beetles, bees, may-flies, dragon-flies, and"
4214,SWALLOWS.,all kinds of flies from break of day till sunset.  The Anglo-Saxon verb
4215,SWALLOWS.,"to swallow is _swelgan_.  Fain would I take the word _swelgel_, air, sky;"
4216,SWALLOWS.,but the Spanish name for our bird seems conclusive for the baser
4217,SWALLOWS.,"derivation.  The Spaniards call it golondrina (evidently from _gola_,"
4218,SWALLOWS.,"throat); and it may be added, make a cruel kind of amusement out of the"
4219,SWALLOWS.,"gulosity of the swallows, by angling for them with fishing-flies from the"
4220,SWALLOWS.,"walls of the Alhambra, round which the birds dart in myriads on a"
4221,SWALLOWS.,summer’s day—descendants of those that played round the heads of the
4222,SWALLOWS.,"Moorish kings, who perhaps were kinder to their visitors."

4827,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,
4828,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"“FOLLOW that pathway till you come to some arches, and turn under them,"
4829,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"and you will find the Blind School,” was the answer given whenever we"
4830,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,stopped in our bewildered pilgrimage to inquire: but no arches were
4831,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"visible, save one disreputable old bridge, under which no self-respecting"
4832,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"school seemed likely to find shelter; so we went on hopelessly, asking"
4833,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"the way from waggoners and countrymen, who all seemed interested in the"
4834,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"question, but were unable to give us any guidance.  A pitiless hailstorm"
4835,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,rattled on our umbrellas and splashed the mud upon our boots: while the
4836,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"path, it was evident, was leading us on towards the river, not the"
4837,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"school; so at last in despair we turned, and flying before the storm"
4838,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"sought refuge under the despised railway bridge, where a group of"
4839,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"children were playing dry and comfortable, while we were wet and muddy."
4840,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"Once again we inquired for the Blind School, and were told to go on.  The"
4841,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,path led under a succession of iron girders which apparently stand for
4842,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"arches in those regions, and we tramped on discontentedly, feeling we had"
4843,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"been deceived, and that we too might have been dry and safe like the"
4844,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"children, if only our misinformants had called a spade a spade, and a row"
4845,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"of iron girders something else than arches.  But the path took a turn,"
4846,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"and we saw cottages and green fields, and we reached a house which had"
4847,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"two doors, on one of which we read, “Mr. Wallis,” and on the other"
4848,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"nothing: so we chanced the second door, knocked, and were soon among a"
4849,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"group of children, all neat, healthy, and cheerful—but blind.  In this"
4850,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"blind school there were but two people who could see, and these were not"
4851,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"the only teachers, for here the blind helped the blind, as the rich"
4852,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,helped the poor.
4853,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,
4854,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"For this school began with a blind man.  Five years ago, near the banks"
4855,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"of the Severn, a cart containing vitriol was overturned; and of four"
4856,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"people who were there, only two were left alive, and one of these was"
4857,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"blind.  Childless and blind, this man had to begin life again—to learn to"
4858,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"live in darkness, and in darkness to work for others.  For as soon as he"
4859,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"had learned to grope his way, he learned to read in the books provided"
4860,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"for the blind, and went from village to village to find other blind"
4861,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"persons, and teach them how to read also.  Then a noble-hearted woman"
4862,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"came forward to help him, and founded the school; where blind children"
4863,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"are trained to work as well as read, and blind men and women come every"
4864,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"day to be taught trades.  These latter come daily to the school, groping"
4865,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,their way along the path that had been so tedious to our impatience; and
4866,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"learn to work, and also to read, helped sometimes by the teachers,"
4867,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"sometimes by the blind man: who also still goes as before, from village"
4868,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"to village, teaching and comforting those in the same straits as himself."
4869,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,
4870,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"We were guided through a back way, intricate and uneven, where our blind"
4871,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,guide warned us carefully of every step—though he said the children ran
4872,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,about everywhere and never fell—till we went through the school and
4873,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"entered his little house alongside, and found ourselves in a bright"
4874,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"little parlour upstairs, full of books, and tastefully furnished, with a"
4875,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,woman’s taste; for the woman who survived the accident which left her
4876,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"childless and crippled, had still the sight of one eye.  There was an"
4877,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"harmonium in the room, and one of the children came to play it.  He was"
4878,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"called Abraham; but this old name belonged to an intelligent,"
4879,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"bright-faced English lad of twelve, well dressed and handsome but for his"
4880,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"sad dim eyes.  He is the son of a well-to-do farmer, and in education and"
4881,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,intelligence far removed from some of his companions.  He handled the
4882,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"harmonium with his small, delicate fingers as only a real musician can,"
4883,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"and while the music lasted I nearly forgot all the sadness of the scene,"
4884,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"and the hopeless life of the musician and the other children, who, one by"
4885,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"one, guided by the sound, crept up the narrow stairs and came noiselessly"
4886,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"into the room, and stood listening spell-bound till he finished.  “And"
4887,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"now, Lizzie, play,” said some one, and a girl came to the harmonium.  She"
4888,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"knew far less of music than Abraham, and had as yet little execution, but"
4889,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"the sweet, true feeling which she gave to the old hymn tunes stirred the"
4890,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,heart and brought tears to my eyes.  “And would you like to hear us sing
4891,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,the hymn we sang when she was buried?” they asked.  For their
4892,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"benefactress and friend, the woman whose untiring energy had begun and"
4893,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"carried on this work among them, rousing sympathy for them among her"
4894,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"townspeople, and begging for them when her own means were insufficient,"
4895,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"died a few weeks ago, and the children of the school had seen her laid in"
4896,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"the churchyard.  The harmonium was hushed, Lizzie only struck the"
4897,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"keynote, and they all sang, as they had all sung at the grave in the cold"
4898,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"February morning when they saw her lowered into the cold earth,"
4899,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,
4900,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"“I know there is a land where all is bright,”"
4901,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,
4902,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"and they turned their poor sightless eyes to the light, as if that were"
4903,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,to them the symbol of the heaven they longed to reach.  It was too sad.
4904,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"The singing ceased, and we all tried to speak of something else.  “How"
4905,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"did you get that Indian picture?” I asked, looking round, and as the"
4906,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"words left my lips, I reproached myself for speaking to one who could not"
4907,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"see it, of a thing that could have no present interest to him.  But I had"
4908,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"made no mistake, as it chanced.  “Ay, my brother brought it me,” he"
4909,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"answered.  “I know what you mean.”  “It is painted on ivory, is it not?”"
4910,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"“Oh no! this is a picture; my sister wears the one on ivory for a brooch,"
4911,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"though it is rather large for that, maybe; but my brother brought them."
4912,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"He was at Agra during the mutiny, and he brought a ball in his shoulder,"
4913,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"too, back—that’s what he brought; but I’d forgotten the picture till you"
4914,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,mentioned it.  But will you hear the children read now?  Read the history
4915,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"of England, Abraham.”  And Abraham read, opening the book at hazard, and"
4916,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"reading clearly and distinctly the death of Cœur de Lion, his forgiveness"
4917,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"of his enemy, and his burial in Fontevrault in token of his deep"
4918,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"repentance.  The children all listened with pleasure till one little one,"
4919,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"the pet of the flock, whimpered because “Bessie” did not read; so Bessie,"
4920,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"whose fingers were busy with her knitting, was compelled to read,"
4921,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,although coming after Abraham it was rather a trying ordeal.  Still the
4922,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"pet had to be satisfied, and then every one went on with their straw"
4923,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"work, for the funds of the home are dependent on charity or the sale of"
4924,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"work, as friends visiting Worcester will do wisely to remember.  Straw"
4925,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"mats, baskets, and balls were the work of the little ones, and they took"
4926,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,the keenest interest in the question whether I preferred blue and white
4927,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"mats, or purple and white.  I bought both, and shook hands all round, and"
4928,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,in a few minutes was retreading my way towards the broad rolling Severn.
4929,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,Never did I feel how intense the joy of sight was as I did when I stood
4930,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,"by its silver stream, and thought of those I had just left in the little"
4931,BETWEEN THE PATHWAY AND RIVER.,house near the railway bridge.
