41,FAME,"""What means your finch?"""
42,FAME,
43,FAME,"""Being well aware that he cannot sing like a Nightingale,"
44,FAME,"He flits about from tree to tree, and twitters a little tale."""
45,FAME,
46,FAME,"Albeit he is an ancient bird, who tried"
47,FAME,"his pipe in better days, and then was"
48,FAME,"scared by random shots, he is fain to"
49,FAME,lift the migrant wing once more towards the
50,FAME,"humble perch, among the trees he loves. All"
51,FAME,"gardeners own that he does no harm, unless"
52,FAME,"he flits into a thicket of young buds, or a very"
53,FAME,choice ladies' seed-bed. And he hopes that he is
54,FAME,now too wise to commit such indiscretions.
55,FAME,
56,FAME,Perhaps it would have been wiser still to
57,FAME,"have shut up his little mandible, or employed it"
58,FAME,
59,FAME,only upon grub. But the long gnaw of last
60,FAME,"winter's frost, which set mankind a-shivering,"
61,FAME,"even in their most downy nest, has made them"
62,FAME,kindly to the race that has no roof for shelter
63,FAME,and no hearth for warmth.
64,FAME,
65,FAME,"Anyhow, this little finch can do no harm,"
66,FAME,"if he does no good; and if he pleases nobody,"
67,FAME,"he will not be surprised, because he has never"
68,FAME,satisfied himself.

78,NOTE,careful trimming.

80,NOTE,Standing afar. I gaze with doubt at other trimmings which are not mine.
81,NOTE,"They have conquered the taste of the day perhaps, and high art announces"
82,NOTE,them as her last transfiguration. Moreover they are highly recommended--
83,NOTE,as the purest art not always is--by the modesty of the artist.

115,II,Beneath a fine control--
116,II,
117,II,"Shall ever come a fairer day,"
118,II,"When thou shalt be a buoyant plume,"
119,II,"To soar, where clearer suns illume,"

142,III,"Despising gold, and sham renown;"
