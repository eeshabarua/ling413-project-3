80,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,
81,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"The _Pervigilium Veneris_--of unknown authorship, but clearly belonging"
82,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"to the late literature of the Roman Empire--has survived in two MSS.,"
83,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,both preserved at Paris in the _Bibliothèque Nationale_.
84,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,
85,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,Of these two MSS. the better written may be assigned (at earliest) to
86,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,the close of the seventh century; the other (again at earliest) to the
87,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,close of the ninth. Both are corrupt; the work of two illiterate
88,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,copyists who--strange to say--were both smatterers enough to betray
89,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,their little knowledge by converting _Pervigilium_ into _Per Virgilium_
90,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"(_scilicet_, ""by Virgil""): thus helping us to follow the process of"
91,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,thought by which the Middle Ages turned Virgil into a wizard. Here and
92,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"there the texts become quite silly, separately or in consent; and just"
93,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,where they agree in the most surprising way--_i.e._ in the arrangement
94,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,of the lines--the conjectural emendator is invited to do his worst by a
95,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"note at the head of the older Codex, ""Sunt vero versus xxii""--""There are"
96,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"rightly twenty-two lines."""
97,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,
98,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,This has started much ingenious guess-work. But no really convincing
99,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,rearrangement has been achieved as yet; and I have been content to take
100,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"the text pretty well as it stands, with a few corrections upon which"
101,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"most scholars agree. With a poem of ""paratactic structure"" the best of"
102,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"us may easily go astray by transposing lines, or blocks of lines, to"
103,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"correspond with _our_ sequence of thought; and I shall be content if,"
104,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"following the only texts to which appeal can be made,[1] my translation"
105,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,be generally intelligible.
106,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,
107,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"It runs pretty closely, line for line, with the original; because one"
108,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,may love and emulate classical terseness even while despairing to rival
109,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"it. But it does not attempt to be literal; for even were it worth doing,"
110,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,I doubt if it be possible for anyone in our day to hit precisely the
111,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,note intended by an author or heard by a reader in the eighth century.
112,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"Men change subtly as nations succeed to nations, religions to religions,"
113,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,philosophies to philosophies; and it is a property of immortal poetry to
114,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,shift its appeal. It does not live by continuing to mean the some thing.
115,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"It grows as we grow. We smile, for instance, when some interlocutor in a"
116,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,dialogue of Plato takes a line from the _Iliad_ and applies it seriously
117,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,_au pied de la lettre_. We can hardly conceive what the great line
118,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"conveyed to him; but it may mean something equally serious to us, though"
119,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,in a different way.
120,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,
121,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,[1] Facsimiles of the two Codices can be studied in a careful edition of
122,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"the _Pervigilum_ by Mr Cecil Clementi, published by Mr B.H. Blackwell of"
123,THE VIGIL OF VENUS,"Oxford, 1911."

142,PERVIGILIUM VENERIS,for you!
143,PERVIGILIUM VENERIS,It is Spring; and the Loves and the birds wing together and woo to accord
144,PERVIGILIUM VENERIS,Where the bough to the rain has unbraided her locks as a bride to
145,PERVIGILIUM VENERIS,her lord.

162,PERVIGILIUM VENERIS,Et micant lacrimæ trementes de caduco pondere:
163,PERVIGILIUM VENERIS,
164,PERVIGILIUM VENERIS,"Time was that a rain-cloud begat her, impregning the heave of the deep,"
165,PERVIGILIUM VENERIS,"'Twixt hooves of sea-horses a-scatter, stampeding the dolphins as"

453,THE REGENT,"Porch and entrance of Chapel, R. A semicircular"
454,THE REGENT,"balcony, L., with balustrade and marble seats, and an"
455,THE REGENT,opening whence a flight of steps leads down to the
456,THE REGENT,city. The city lies out of sight below the terrace;
457,THE REGENT,"from which, between its cypresses and statuary, is"
458,THE REGENT,seen a straight stretch of a canal; beyond the canal are
459,THE REGENT,"sand-hills and the line of the open sea. Mountains,"
460,THE REGENT,"L., dip down to the sea and form a curve of the"
461,THE REGENT,coast._
462,THE REGENT,
463,THE REGENT,"_As the curtain rises, a crowd of town and country"
464,THE REGENT,folk is being herded to the back of the terrace by the
465,THE REGENT,"Ducal Guard, under Cesario. Within the Chapel, to_"

468,THE REGENT,
469,THE REGENT,"_Cesario, Gamba the Fool, Guards, Populace._"
470,THE REGENT,
471,THE REGENT,
472,THE REGENT,_Cesario._ Way there! Give room! The Regent comes from Mass.
473,THE REGENT,"Guards, butt them on the toes--way there! give room!"
474,THE REGENT,Prick me that laggard's leg-importunate fools!
475,THE REGENT,
476,THE REGENT,_Guards._ Room for the Regent! Room!
477,THE REGENT,
478,THE REGENT,[_The sacring bell rings within the Chapel._
479,THE REGENT,
480,THE REGENT,"_Cesario._ Hark there, the bell!"
481,THE REGENT,
482,THE REGENT,[_A pause. Men of the crowd take off their caps._
483,THE REGENT,
484,THE REGENT,"Could ye not leave, this day of all the year,"
485,THE REGENT,"Your silly suits, petitions, quarrels, pleas?"
486,THE REGENT,"Could ye not leave, this once in seven years,"
487,THE REGENT,Our Lady to come holy-quiet from Mass.
488,THE REGENT,"Lean on the wall, and loose her cage-bird heart,"
489,THE REGENT,To lift and breast and dance upon the breeze.
490,THE REGENT,Draws home her lord the Duke?
491,THE REGENT,
492,THE REGENT,_Crowd._ Long live the Duke!
493,THE REGENT,
494,THE REGENT,"_Cesario._ The devil, then! Why darken his approach?"
495,THE REGENT,
496,THE REGENT,
497,THE REGENT,_Gamba (from the bench where he has been mending his
498,THE REGENT,"viol)._ Because, Captain, 'tis a property knaves"
499,THE REGENT,and fools have in common--to stand in their own
500,THE REGENT,"light, as 'tis of soldiers to talk bad logic. That"
501,THE REGENT,"knave, now--he with the red nose and the black"
502,THE REGENT,"eye--the Duke's colours, loyal man!--you clap"
503,THE REGENT,"an iron on his leg, and ask him why he is not"
504,THE REGENT,"down in the city, hanging them out of window!"
505,THE REGENT,Go to: you are a soldier!
506,THE REGENT,
507,THE REGENT,"_Cesario._ And you a Fool, and on your own showing"
508,THE REGENT,stand in your own light.
509,THE REGENT,
510,THE REGENT,"_Gamba._ Nay, neither in my own light, nor as a"
511,THE REGENT,Fool. So should myself stand between the sun
512,THE REGENT,and my shadow; whereas I am not myself--these
513,THE REGENT,seven years have I been but the shadow of a
514,THE REGENT,Fool. Yet one must tune up for the Duke.

524,THE REGENT,
525,THE REGENT,"_A Voice._               Captain, no sail!"
526,THE REGENT,
527,THE REGENT,_Cesario._                                 Where sits
528,THE REGENT,The wind?
529,THE REGENT,
530,THE REGENT,"_Voice._    Nor' west, and north a point!"
531,THE REGENT,
532,THE REGENT,_Cesario._                                Perchance
533,THE REGENT,They have down'd sail and creep around the flats.
534,THE REGENT,
535,THE REGENT,"_Gamba (tuning his viol)._ Flats, flats! the straight horizon, and the life"
536,THE REGENT,These seven years laid by rule!  The curst canal
537,THE REGENT,Drawn level through the drawn-out level sand
538,THE REGENT,And thistle-tufts that stink as soon as pluck'd!
539,THE REGENT,"Give me the hot crag and the dancing heat,"
540,THE REGENT,"Give me the Abruzzi, and the cushioned thyme--"
541,THE REGENT,"Brooks at my feet, high glittering snows above."
542,THE REGENT,"What were thy music, viol, without a ridge?"
543,THE REGENT,
544,THE REGENT,
545,THE REGENT,[_Noise of commotion in the city below._
546,THE REGENT,
547,THE REGENT,
548,THE REGENT,"_Cesario_. Watchman, what news?"
549,THE REGENT,
550,THE REGENT,"_A Voice_.                    Sir, on the sea no sail!"
551,THE REGENT,
552,THE REGENT,_One of the Crowd_. But through the town below a horseman spurs--
553,THE REGENT,"I think, Count Lucio! Yes--Count Lucio!"
554,THE REGENT,"He nears, draws rein, dismounts!"
555,THE REGENT,
556,THE REGENT,"_Cesario_.                  Sure, he brings news."
557,THE REGENT,
558,THE REGENT,
559,THE REGENT,_Gamba_. I think he brings word the Duke is sick;
560,THE REGENT,his loyal folk have drunk so much of his
561,THE REGENT,health.
562,THE REGENT,
563,THE REGENT,[_A murmur has been growing in the town below. It
564,THE REGENT,breaks into cheers as Count Lucio comes springing
565,THE REGENT,up to the terrace._
566,THE REGENT,
567,THE REGENT,_Enter Lucio._
568,THE REGENT,
569,THE REGENT,
570,THE REGENT,_Lucio._ News! Where's the Regent? Eh? is Mass not said?
571,THE REGENT,"Cesario, news! I rode across the dunes;"
572,THE REGENT,A pilot--Nestore--you know the man--
573,THE REGENT,Came panting. Sixteen sail beyond the point!
574,THE REGENT,That's not a galley lost!
575,THE REGENT,
576,THE REGENT,_Crowd._            Long live the Duke!
577,THE REGENT,
578,THE REGENT,_Lucio._ Hark to the tocsin!  I have carried fire--
579,THE REGENT,"Wildfire! Why, where's my sister? I've a mind--"
580,THE REGENT,
581,THE REGENT,
582,THE REGENT,[_He strides towards the door of the Chapel; but
583,THE REGENT,"pauses at the sound of chanting within, and"
584,THE REGENT,comes back to Cesario._
585,THE REGENT,
586,THE REGENT,
587,THE REGENT,"Man, are you mute? I say the town's aflame"
588,THE REGENT,"Below! But here, up here, you stand and stare"
589,THE REGENT,"Like prisoners loosed to daylight. Rub your eyes,"
590,THE REGENT,Believe!
591,THE REGENT,
592,THE REGENT,_Cesario (musing)._ It has been long.
593,THE REGENT,
594,THE REGENT,_Lucio._                            As tapestry
595,THE REGENT,Pricked out by women's needles; point-device
596,THE REGENT,"As saints in fitted haloes. Yet they stab,"
597,THE REGENT,"Those needles. Oh, the devil take their tongues!"
598,THE REGENT,
599,THE REGENT,"_Cesario._ Why, what's the matter?"
600,THE REGENT,
601,THE REGENT,_Lucio._ P'st! another lie
602,THE REGENT,Against the Countess Fulvia; and the train
603,THE REGENT,"Laid to my sister's ear. Cesario,"
604,THE REGENT,My sister is a saint--and yet she married:
605,THE REGENT,"Therefore should understand ... Would saints, like cobblers,"
606,THE REGENT,Stick but to business in this naughty world!
607,THE REGENT,"Ah, well! the Duke comes home."
608,THE REGENT,
609,THE REGENT,_Cesario._ And what of that?
610,THE REGENT,
611,THE REGENT,_Lucio._ Release!
612,THE REGENT,
613,THE REGENT,_Cesario._ Release?
614,THE REGENT,
615,THE REGENT,_Lucio (mocking a chant within the Chapel)._ From priests and petticoats
616,THE REGENT,"Deliver us, Good Lord!"
617,THE REGENT,
618,THE REGENT,_Gamba (strikes a chord on viol). AMEN!_
619,THE REGENT,
620,THE REGENT,"_Cesario._ Count Lucio,"
621,THE REGENT,"These seven years agone, when the Duke sailed,"
622,THE REGENT,"You were a child--a pretty, forward boy;"
623,THE REGENT,"And I a young lieutenant of the Guard,"
624,THE REGENT,"Burning to serve abroad. But that day, rather,"
625,THE REGENT,I clenched my nails over an inward wound:
626,THE REGENT,For that a something manlier than my years--
627,THE REGENT,"Look, bearing, what-not--by the Duke not miss'd,"
628,THE REGENT,Condemned me to promotion: I must bide
629,THE REGENT,"At home, command the Guard! 'Tis an old hurt,"
630,THE REGENT,"But scalded on my memory.... Well, they sailed!"
631,THE REGENT,"And from the terrace here, sick with self-pity,"
632,THE REGENT,"Wrapped in my wrong, forgetful of devoir,"
633,THE REGENT,I watch'd them through a mist--turned with a sob--
634,THE REGENT,Uptore my rooted sight--
635,THE REGENT,"There, there she stood;"
636,THE REGENT,"Her hand press'd to her girdle, where the babe"
637,THE REGENT,Stirred in her body while she gazed--she gazed--
638,THE REGENT,"But slowly back controlled her eyes, met mine;"
639,THE REGENT,"So--with how wan, how small, how brave a smile!--"
640,THE REGENT,Reached me her hands to kiss ...
641,THE REGENT,O royal hands!
642,THE REGENT,What burdens since they have borne let Adria tell.
643,THE REGENT,"But hear me swear by them, Count Lucio--"
644,THE REGENT,Who slights our Regent throws his glove to me.
645,THE REGENT,
646,THE REGENT,"_Lucio._ Why, soothly, she's my sister!"
647,THE REGENT,
648,THE REGENT,_Cesario._ 'But the court
649,THE REGENT,"Is dull? No masques, few banquetings--and prayers"
650,THE REGENT,"Be long, and youth for pastime leaps the gate?'"
651,THE REGENT,Yet if the money husbanded on feasts
652,THE REGENT,"Have fed our soldiery against the Turk,"
653,THE REGENT,"Year after year, and still the State not starved;"
654,THE REGENT,"Was't not well done? And if, responsible"
655,THE REGENT,"To God, and lonely, she has leaned on God"
656,THE REGENT,"Too heavily for our patience, was't not wise?--"
657,THE REGENT,"And well, though weary?"
658,THE REGENT,
659,THE REGENT,"_Lucio._ I tell you, she's my sister!"
660,THE REGENT,
661,THE REGENT,"_Cesario._ Well, an you will, bridle on that. Lord Lucio,"
662,THE REGENT,"You named the Countess Fulvia. To my sorrow,"
663,THE REGENT,Two hours ago I called on her and laid her
664,THE REGENT,Under arrest.
665,THE REGENT,
666,THE REGENT,_Lucio._ The devil! For what?
667,THE REGENT,
668,THE REGENT,_Cesario._ For that
669,THE REGENT,"A lady, whose lord keeps summer in the hills"
670,THE REGENT,"To nurse a gouty foot, should penalize"
671,THE REGENT,His dutiful return by shutting doors
672,THE REGENT,"And hanging out a ladder made of rope,"
673,THE REGENT,Or prove its safety by rehearsing it
674,THE REGENT,Upon a heavier man.
675,THE REGENT,
676,THE REGENT,_Lucio._ I'll go to her.
677,THE REGENT,"Oh, this is infamous!"
678,THE REGENT,
679,THE REGENT,"_Cesario._ Nay, be advised:"
680,THE REGENT,"No hardship irks the lady, save to sit"
681,THE REGENT,At home and feed her sparrows; nor no worse
682,THE REGENT,Annoy than from her balcony to spy
683,THE REGENT,(Should the eye rove) a Switzer of the Guard
684,THE REGENT,"At post between her raspberry-canes, to watch"
685,THE REGENT,And fright the thrushes from forbidden fruit.
686,THE REGENT,
687,THE REGENT,_Lucio._ Infamous! infamous!
688,THE REGENT,
689,THE REGENT,"_Cesario._ Enough, my lord:"
690,THE REGENT,The Regent!
691,THE REGENT,
692,THE REGENT,
693,THE REGENT,"[_Doors of the Chapel open. The organ sounds,"
694,THE REGENT,with voices of choir chanting the recessional.
695,THE REGENT,"The Court enters from Mass, attending the"
696,THE REGENT,Regent Ottilia and her son Tonino. She wears
697,THE REGENT,a crown and heavy dalmatic. Her brother
698,THE REGENT,"Lucio, controlling himself with an effort, kisses"
699,THE REGENT,"her hand and conducts her to the marble bench,"
700,THE REGENT,"which serves for her Chair of State. She bows,"
701,THE REGENT,"receiving the homage of the crowd; but, after"
702,THE REGENT,"seating herself, appears for a few moments unconscious"
703,THE REGENT,"of her surroundings. Then, as her"
704,THE REGENT,rosary slips from her fingers and falls heavily
705,THE REGENT,"at her feet, she speaks._"
706,THE REGENT,
707,THE REGENT,"_Regent._ So slips the chain linking this world with Heaven,"
708,THE REGENT,And drops me back to earth: so slips the chain
709,THE REGENT,That hangs my spirit to the Redeemer's cross
710,THE REGENT,Above pollution in the pure swept air
711,THE REGENT,Whereunder frets this hive: so slips the chain--
712,THE REGENT,_(She starts up)_--God! the dear sound! Was that his anchor dropped?
713,THE REGENT,"Speak to the watchman, one! Call to the watch!"
714,THE REGENT,What news?
715,THE REGENT,
716,THE REGENT,_Cesario._ Aloft! What news?
717,THE REGENT,
718,THE REGENT,_Voice above._ No sail as yet!
719,THE REGENT,
720,THE REGENT,"_Regent._ Ah, pardon, sirs! My ears are strung to-day,"
721,THE REGENT,And play false airs invented by the wind.
722,THE REGENT,Methought a hawse-pipe rattled ...
723,THE REGENT,
724,THE REGENT,"_Gamba (chants to his viol). Shepherds, see--"
725,THE REGENT,Lo! What a mariner love hath made me!_
726,THE REGENT,
727,THE REGENT,_Regent._ What chants the Fool?
728,THE REGENT,
729,THE REGENT,"_Gamba._ Madonna, 'tis a trifle"
730,THE REGENT,Made by a silly poet on wives that stand
731,THE REGENT,All night at windows listening the surf--
732,THE REGENT,"_Now he comes! Will he come? Alas! no, no!_"
733,THE REGENT,
734,THE REGENT,"_Lucio._ Peace, lively! Madam, there is news--brave news!"
735,THE REGENT,I'm from the watch-house. There the pilots tell
736,THE REGENT,"Of sixteen sail to the southward! Sixteen sail,"
737,THE REGENT,And nearing fast!
738,THE REGENT,
739,THE REGENT,_Regent._ Praise God! dear Lucio!
740,THE REGENT,
741,THE REGENT,
742,THE REGENT,[_She has seated herself again. She takes Lucio's
743,THE REGENT,"hand and speaks, petting it._"
744,THE REGENT,
745,THE REGENT,
746,THE REGENT,What?  Glowing with my happiness?  That's like you.
747,THE REGENT,"But for yourself the hour, too, holds release."
748,THE REGENT,
749,THE REGENT,"_Lucio (between sullenness and shame, with a glance at"
750,THE REGENT,"Cesario)._ ""Release?"""
751,THE REGENT,
752,THE REGENT,_Regent._          You will forgive? I have great need
753,THE REGENT,To be forgiven: sadly I have been slack
754,THE REGENT,"In guardianship, and by so much betrayed"
755,THE REGENT,My promise to our mother's passing soul.
756,THE REGENT,"Myself in cares immersed, I left the child"
757,THE REGENT,Among his toys--and turn to find him man--
758,THE REGENT,But yet so much a boy that boyhood can
759,THE REGENT,"_(Wistfully)_ Laugh in his honest eyes? Forgive me, Lucio!"
760,THE REGENT,"Tell me, whate'er have slackened, there has slipped"
761,THE REGENT,"No knot of love. To-morrow we'll make sport,"
762,THE REGENT,"Be playmates and invent new games, and old--"
763,THE REGENT,Wreath flowers for crowns--
764,THE REGENT,
765,THE REGENT,
766,THE REGENT,[_He drags his hand away. She gazes at him
767,THE REGENT,"wistfully, and turns to the Captain of the"
768,THE REGENT,Guard._
769,THE REGENT,
770,THE REGENT,
771,THE REGENT,"Cesario,"
772,THE REGENT,What are the suits?
773,THE REGENT,
774,THE REGENT,"_Cesario._        They are but three to-day,"
775,THE REGENT,"Madonna. First, a scoundrel here in irons"
776,THE REGENT,For having struck the Guard.
777,THE REGENT,
778,THE REGENT,"_Regent (eying the culprit)._            His name, I think,"
779,THE REGENT,"Is Donatello Crocco. Hey? You improve,"
780,THE REGENT,Good man. The last time 'twas your wife you basted.
781,THE REGENT,"At this rate, in another year or two"
782,THE REGENT,You'll bang the Turk. Do you confess the assault?
783,THE REGENT,
784,THE REGENT,_Prisoner._ I do.
785,THE REGENT,
786,THE REGENT,_Regent._ Upon a promise we dismiss you.
787,THE REGENT,"Your tavern, as it comes into our mind,"
788,THE REGENT,"Is the 'Three Cups.' So many, and no more,"
789,THE REGENT,"You'll drink to-day--have we your word? Three cups,"
790,THE REGENT,And each a _Viva_ for the Duke's return.
791,THE REGENT,
792,THE REGENT,"_Prisoner._ Your Highness, I'll not take it at the price"
793,THE REGENT,Of my good manners. I'm a gallant man:
794,THE REGENT,And who in Adria calls. 'Three cheers for the Duke!'
795,THE REGENT,"But adds a fourth for the Duchess? Lady, nay;"
796,THE REGENT,"Grant me that fourth, or back I go to the cells!"
797,THE REGENT,
798,THE REGENT,
799,THE REGENT,[_The Regent laughs and nods to the Guard to release
800,THE REGENT,him._
801,THE REGENT,
802,THE REGENT,
803,THE REGENT,_Regent._ What next?
804,THE REGENT,
805,THE REGENT,_An Old Woman (very rapidly)._ Your Highness will not know me--Zia
806,THE REGENT,"Agnese, Giovannucci's wife that was;"
807,THE REGENT,"And feed a two-three cows, as a widow may,"
808,THE REGENT,On the marshes where the grass is salt and sweet
809,THE REGENT,As your Highness knows--and always true to pail
810,THE REGENT,Until this Nicolo--
811,THE REGENT,
812,THE REGENT,"_Nicolo._ Lies! lies, your Highness!"
813,THE REGENT,
814,THE REGENT,"_Old Woman._ Having a quarrel, puts the evil eye"
815,THE REGENT,"On Serafina. She's my best of cows,"
816,THE REGENT,In stall with calf but ten days weaned.
817,THE REGENT,
818,THE REGENT,_Nicolo._ Lies! lies!
819,THE REGENT,
820,THE REGENT,_Old Woman._ I would your Highness saw her! When that thief
821,THE REGENT,"Hangs upon Lazarus' bosom, he'll be bidding"
822,THE REGENT,"A ducat for each drop of milk he's cost me,"
823,THE REGENT,To cool his tongue.
824,THE REGENT,
825,THE REGENT,"_Regent._ Ay--ay, the cow is sick,"
826,THE REGENT,"I think; and mind me, being country-bred,"
827,THE REGENT,"Of a cure for such: which is, to buy a comb"
828,THE REGENT,And comb the sufferer's tail at feeding-time.
829,THE REGENT,"If Zia Agnese do but this, she'll counter"
830,THE REGENT,"The Evil Eye, and maybe with her own"
831,THE REGENT,Detect who thieves her Serafina's hay.
832,THE REGENT,
833,THE REGENT,_Old Woman._ God bless your Highness!
834,THE REGENT,
835,THE REGENT,_Nicolo._ God bless your Highness!
836,THE REGENT,
837,THE REGENT,"_Regent (taking up a fresh suit)._Why, what's here? ""_Costanza,"
838,THE REGENT,"Wife of Giuseppe Boni, citeth him"
839,THE REGENT,"And sueth to live separate, for neglect"
840,THE REGENT,"And divers beatings, as to wit----_"" H'm, h'm--"
841,THE REGENT,"_Likewise to keep the child Geronimo,"
842,THE REGENT,Begotten of his body._ You defend
843,THE REGENT,"The suit, Giuseppe?"
844,THE REGENT,
845,THE REGENT,_A Young Peasant (shrugs his shoulders)._ As the woman will!
846,THE REGENT,I'll not deny I beat her.
847,THE REGENT,
848,THE REGENT,_Regent._ But neglect!
849,THE REGENT,How came you to neglect her? Look on her--
850,THE REGENT,"The handsome, frowsy slut, that, by appearance,"
851,THE REGENT,Hath never washed her body since she wed.
852,THE REGENT,A beating we might pass. But how neglect
853,THE REGENT,To take her by the neck unto the pump
854,THE REGENT,And hold her till her wet and furious face
855,THE REGENT,Were once again worth kissing? Well--well--well!
856,THE REGENT,Neglect is proven. She shall have deserts:
857,THE REGENT,"_(To a Clerk)_ But--write, ""Defendant keeps his lawful child."""
858,THE REGENT,
859,THE REGENT,_Young Peasant._ My lady--
860,THE REGENT,
861,THE REGENT,"_Wife._ Nay, my lady--"
862,THE REGENT,
863,THE REGENT,_Regent._ Eh? What's this?
864,THE REGENT,
865,THE REGENT,"_Wife._ The poor _bambino_! Nay, 'twas not the suit!"
866,THE REGENT,"How should Giuseppe, being a fool, a man--"
867,THE REGENT,
868,THE REGENT,"_Young Peasant._ Aye, aye: that's sense. I love him: still, you see--"
869,THE REGENT,
870,THE REGENT,"_Regent._ An if my judgment suit you not, go home,"
871,THE REGENT,The pair. _(As they are going she calls the woman back.)_
872,THE REGENT,Costanza! hath your husband erred
873,THE REGENT,With other woman?
874,THE REGENT,
875,THE REGENT,_Young Peasant_.    Never!
876,THE REGENT,
877,THE REGENT,_Wife_.                    I'll not charge him
878,THE REGENT,With that.
879,THE REGENT,
880,THE REGENT,"_Regent_.    But, yes, you may. This man hath held"
881,THE REGENT,Another woman to his breast.
882,THE REGENT,
883,THE REGENT,_Wife_.                        Her name?
884,THE REGENT,That I may tear her eyes!
885,THE REGENT,
886,THE REGENT,_Regent_.                   Her name's Costanza.
887,THE REGENT,"The same Costanza that, with body washed,"
888,THE REGENT,"With ribbon in her hair, light in her eyes,"
889,THE REGENT,Arrayed a cottage to allure his heart.
890,THE REGENT,"Go home, poor fools, and find her!..."
891,THE REGENT,Heigh! No others?       [_Heaves a sigh._
892,THE REGENT,"Captain, dismiss the Guard. The watch, aloft--"
893,THE REGENT,Set him elsewhere. We would not be o'erlooked.
894,THE REGENT,"You only, Lucio--you, Lucetta--stay;"
895,THE REGENT,"You for a while, Cesario."
896,THE REGENT,
897,THE REGENT,"[_Exeunt Courtiers, Guard, Crowd, etc._"
898,THE REGENT,
899,THE REGENT,Heigh! that's over--
900,THE REGENT,The last Court of the Regent; and the books
901,THE REGENT,"Accounts of stewardship, my seven years all,"
902,THE REGENT,Closed here for audit.
903,THE REGENT,"Nay, there's one thing more--"
904,THE REGENT,"Brother, erewhile I spoke you sisterly,"
905,THE REGENT,"You turned away, and still you bite your lip:"
906,THE REGENT,Signs that may short my preface. It concerns
907,THE REGENT,The Countess Fulvia.
908,THE REGENT,
909,THE REGENT,_Lucio_. Ha!
910,THE REGENT,
911,THE REGENT,"_Regent_. Go, bring her, Captain."
912,THE REGENT,
913,THE REGENT,[_Exit Cesario_.
914,THE REGENT,
915,THE REGENT,"List to me, Lucio: listen, brother dear,"
916,THE REGENT,"First playmate-child, tending whose innocence"
917,THE REGENT,Myself learned motherhood. Shall I deny
918,THE REGENT,Youth to be loved and follow after love?
919,THE REGENT,There is a love breaks like a morning beam
920,THE REGENT,On the husht novice kneeling by his arms;
921,THE REGENT,"And worse there is, whose kisses strangle love,"
922,THE REGENT,"Whose feet take hold of hell. My Lucio,"
923,THE REGENT,Follow not that!
924,THE REGENT,
925,THE REGENT,"_Lucio_. Why, who--who hath maligned"
926,THE REGENT,The Countess?
927,THE REGENT,
928,THE REGENT,"_Regent_ Not maligned. Lucetta, here--"
929,THE REGENT,
930,THE REGENT,_Lucio_. Lucetta! Curse Lucetta and her tongue!
931,THE REGENT,"Am I a child, to be nagged by waiting-maids?"
932,THE REGENT,
933,THE REGENT,"_Regent_. No, but a man, and shall weigh evidence."
934,THE REGENT,
935,THE REGENT,_Lucio_. But I'll not hear it! If her viper tongue
936,THE REGENT,"Can kill, why kill it must. But send me a man,"
937,THE REGENT,"And I will smite his mouth--ay, slit his tongue--"
938,THE REGENT,That dares defame the Countess!
939,THE REGENT,
940,THE REGENT,_Regent_. Stay: she comes.
941,THE REGENT,
942,THE REGENT,"[_Enter the Countess Fulvia, Cesario attending._"
943,THE REGENT,
944,THE REGENT,"Madam, the reason wherefore you are summoned"
945,THE REGENT,"No doubt you guess, from a rude earlier call"
946,THE REGENT,"Our Captain paid you. Certain practices,"
947,THE REGENT,"Which you may force me name, are charged upon"
948,THE REGENT,you
949,THE REGENT,On testimony you may force me call
950,THE REGENT,And may with freedom question.
951,THE REGENT,
952,THE REGENT,_Fulvia_. I'll not question:
953,THE REGENT,"No, nor I will not answer."
954,THE REGENT,
955,THE REGENT,_Lucio_. Then I'll answer!'
956,THE REGENT,"For me, for all, she is innocent!"
957,THE REGENT,
958,THE REGENT,_Regent_. For you?
959,THE REGENT,We'll hope it: but 'for all' 's more wide an oath
960,THE REGENT,"Than you can swear, sir. I'll not bandy you"
961,THE REGENT,Words nor debate. Myself the ladder saw;
962,THE REGENT,"Lucetta, here, the ladder and the man."
963,THE REGENT,_What_ man she will not say. Cesario
964,THE REGENT,Has tracked his footprint on her garden plots.
965,THE REGENT,Must we say more?
966,THE REGENT,
967,THE REGENT,_Fulvia_. No need. Her fingering mind
968,THE REGENT,Is a close cupboard turning all things rancid.
969,THE REGENT,
970,THE REGENT,"_Lucio_. Yea, for such wry-necks all the world's a lawn"
971,THE REGENT,To peek and peer and pounce a sinful worm;
972,THE REGENT,"The fatter, the more luscious."
973,THE REGENT,
974,THE REGENT,"_Regent. _ Lucio,"
975,THE REGENT,This woman nought gainsays.
976,THE REGENT,
977,THE REGENT,_Fulvia (fiercely)._ As why should I?
978,THE REGENT,"I'll question not, nor answer. 'Neath your brow"
979,THE REGENT,"My sentence hunches, crawls, like cat to spring."
980,THE REGENT,Pah! there's no prude will match your virtuous wife
981,THE REGENT,You'd banish me?
982,THE REGENT,
983,THE REGENT,"_Regent._ I do. Cesario,"
984,THE REGENT,See to it the City gate shuts not to-night.
985,THE REGENT,And she this side.
986,THE REGENT,
987,THE REGENT,_Fulvia (laughs recklessly)._ To-night? To-night's your own.
988,THE REGENT,"Most modest woman! Duchess, there's a well"
989,THE REGENT,"By the road, some seven miles beyond the town."
990,THE REGENT,"There, 'neath the stars, I'll dip a hand and drink"
991,THE REGENT,To the good Duke's disport. But have a care!
992,THE REGENT,That cup's not yet to lip.
993,THE REGENT,
994,THE REGENT,"_Regent.        _ Captain, remove her."
995,THE REGENT,"Lucio, remain."
996,THE REGENT,
997,THE REGENT,"_[Exeunt the Countess Fulvia, Cesario following]_"
998,THE REGENT,
999,THE REGENT,_Lucio._ I'll not remain--When ice
1000,THE REGENT,"Sits judge of fire, what justice shall be done?"
1001,THE REGENT,"Sister, there be your books--peruse them. There"
1002,THE REGENT,The sea-line--bide you so with back to it.
1003,THE REGENT,While the cold inward heat of cruelty
1004,THE REGENT,"Warms what was once your heart, now crusted o'er"
1005,THE REGENT,With duty and slimed with poisonous drip of tongues.
1006,THE REGENT,"God help the Duke, if what he left he'd find!"
1007,THE REGENT,
1008,THE REGENT,_[Exit Lucio]_
1009,THE REGENT,
1010,THE REGENT,"_Regent._ Is't so, I wonder? Go, Lucetta, fetch"
1011,THE REGENT,"My glass, if haply I may tell."
1012,THE REGENT,
1013,THE REGENT,_[Exit Lucetta.]_
1014,THE REGENT,
1015,THE REGENT,Is't so?
1016,THE REGENT,"And have these years enforced, encrusted me"
1017,THE REGENT,"To something monstrous, neither woman nor man?"
1018,THE REGENT,"My lord, my lord! too heavy was the load"
1019,THE REGENT,You laid! Yet I'll not blame you: for myself
1020,THE REGENT,Ruled the straight path the long account correct
1021,THE REGENT,"As in these books, my ledgers...."
1022,THE REGENT,
1023,THE REGENT,"[_While she turns the pages, Gamba the Fool creeps"
1024,THE REGENT,in and hoists himself on the balustrade. He
1025,THE REGENT,"tries his viol, and sings_."
1026,THE REGENT,
1027,THE REGENT,SONG: _Gamba_.
1028,THE REGENT,
1029,THE REGENT,"Bird of the South, my Rondinello--"
1030,THE REGENT,
1031,THE REGENT,_Regent_. Hey? That Song!
1032,THE REGENT,
1033,THE REGENT,"_Gamba_. Hie to me, fly to me, steel-blue mate!"
1034,THE REGENT,Under my breast-knot flutters thy fellow;
1035,THE REGENT,"Here can I rest not, and thou so late."
1036,THE REGENT,"Home, to me, home!"
1037,THE REGENT,"'Love, love, I come!'"
1038,THE REGENT,"--Dear one, I wait!"
1039,THE REGENT,"_Quanno nacesti tu, nacqui pur io:"
1040,THE REGENT,"La lundananza tua, 'l desiderio mio_!"
1041,THE REGENT,"You know the song, madonna?"
1042,THE REGENT,
1043,THE REGENT,"_Regent_. Ay, fool. Sit"
1044,THE REGENT,"Here at my feet, sing on."
1045,THE REGENT,

1052,THE REGENT,"Home, to me, home!"
1053,THE REGENT,"'Love, love, I come!'"
1054,THE REGENT,"Ah, love, the pain!"
1055,THE REGENT,"_Addio, addio! ed un' altra volt' addio!"

1058,THE REGENT,A foolish rustic thing the shepherd wives
1059,THE REGENT,"In our Abruzzi croon by winter fires,"
1060,THE REGENT,Of their husbands in the plains.
1061,THE REGENT,
1062,THE REGENT,_Regent_. Gamba!
1063,THE REGENT,
1064,THE REGENT,_Gamba_. Madonna?
1065,THE REGENT,
1066,THE REGENT,"_Regent_. I'd make thee my confessor. Mindest thou,"
1067,THE REGENT,"By Villalago, where from Sanno's lake"
1068,THE REGENT,"The stream, our Tasso, hurls it down the glen?"
1069,THE REGENT,"One noon, with Lucio--ever in those days"
1070,THE REGENT,"With Lucio--on a rock within the spray,"
1071,THE REGENT,"I wove a ferny garland, while the boy"
1072,THE REGENT,"Roamed, but returned in triumph, having trapped"
1073,THE REGENT,"A bee in a bell-flower--held it to my ear,"
1074,THE REGENT,"Laughing, dissembling that he feared to loose"
1075,THE REGENT,"The hairy thief. So laughed we--and were still,"
1076,THE REGENT,"As deep in Vallescura wound a horn,"
1077,THE REGENT,And up the pathway 'neath the dappling bough
1078,THE REGENT,"Came riding--flecked with sunshine, man and horse,--"
1079,THE REGENT,"My lord, my lover; and that song, that song"
1080,THE REGENT,Upon his lips....
1081,THE REGENT,
1082,THE REGENT,_Voice of Watchman_.        Sail ho! a sail! a sail!
1083,THE REGENT,
1084,THE REGENT,_[Murmur of populace below. It grows and swells to
1085,THE REGENT,"a roar as enter hurriedly courtiers, guards, and"
1086,THE REGENT,others: Cesario; Lucetta with mirror._]

1088,THE REGENT,_Lucetta_. My lady! O my lady!--

1145,THE REGENT,And feel you helpless while he grips and bruises
1146,THE REGENT,"Your weak protesting breasts! You'll die in bliss,"
1147,THE REGENT,Panting your fragrance out.--
1148,THE REGENT,"Wh'st! Hush, poor fool!"
1149,THE REGENT,I have unlearned love's very alphabet.
1150,THE REGENT,"Men like us coy, demure ... Then I'll coquet"
1151,THE REGENT,And play Madam Disdain--but not to-day.
1152,THE REGENT,"To-morrow I'll be shrewish, shy, perverse,"
1153,THE REGENT,"Exacting, cold--all April in my moods:"
1154,THE REGENT,"We'll walk the forest, and I'll slip from him,"
1155,THE REGENT,"Hide me like Dryad 'mid the oaks, and mark"
1156,THE REGENT,His hot dark face pursuing; or I'll couch
1157,THE REGENT,"In covert green, and hold my breath to hear"
1158,THE REGENT,"His blundering foot go by; then up I'll leap,"
1159,THE REGENT,And run--and he'll run after. O this lightness!
1160,THE REGENT,"I'll draw him like a fairy, dance and double--"
1161,THE REGENT,Yet not so fast but he shall overtake
1162,THE REGENT,"At length, and catch me panting. O, I charge you,"
1163,THE REGENT,"I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem,"
1164,THE REGENT,Wake not my love beneath the forest bough
1165,THE REGENT,Where we lie dreaming!
1166,THE REGENT,
1167,THE REGENT,_[Fanfare of trumpets in the distance.]_
1168,THE REGENT,
1169,THE REGENT,"Trumpets, hark! and drums!"
1170,THE REGENT,They have landed! From the quay they march!
1171,THE REGENT,Flowers! flowers!
1172,THE REGENT,They are near ... I see him!... Carlo! lord and love!
1173,THE REGENT,He looks--waves--O 'tis he! O foolish heart!--
1174,THE REGENT,I had feared he'd ta'en a wound.
1175,THE REGENT,What is't they shout?
1176,THE REGENT,"Eh? 'Victory!'--yes, yes. He's browner, thinner;"
1177,THE REGENT,"And the dear eyes, how gaunt!... Yes"
1178,THE REGENT,'Victory!'
1179,THE REGENT,"'Victory!' ... lord, and love!,.."
1180,THE REGENT,
1181,THE REGENT,_[The shouts of acclamation are heard now close
1182,THE REGENT,under the terrace. Spears and banners are
1183,THE REGENT,"seen trooping past. Beside herself, she throws"
1184,THE REGENT,"flowers to them, laughing, weeping the while."
1185,THE REGENT,"Then, running to the Chapel door, she"

1199,THE REGENT,
1200,THE REGENT,_Fulvia._   Then with that!--and that!
1201,THE REGENT,Go meet him!

1204,THE REGENT,Oh! I am slain!

1206,THE REGENT,_Fulvia._   And I am worse!
1207,THE REGENT,"But there's my flower, my red flower, on your breast.--"
1208,THE REGENT,"Go, meet your lord and show it!"
1209,THE REGENT,
1210,THE REGENT,[_She passes down the steps as Lucetta runs in.]_
1211,THE REGENT,
1212,THE REGENT,_Lucetta._ Madam! Madam!
1213,THE REGENT,The Duke is at the gate--Madam!--
1214,THE REGENT,Christ! she is murdered! Murder! Murder!
1215,THE REGENT,
1216,THE REGENT,"_Regent._ Fie,"
1217,THE REGENT,Lucetta! peace! What word to greet the Duke
1218,THE REGENT,"For his home-coming! Lift me ... Quick, my robe--"
1219,THE REGENT,"My Crown! Call no one. O, but hasten!"
1220,THE REGENT,
1221,THE REGENT,"_Lucetta_ (_helpless, wringing her hands_). Madam!"
1222,THE REGENT,
1223,THE REGENT,"_Regent._ I need your strength, and must I steady you?"
1224,THE REGENT,"Lucetta, years ago you disarrayed me"
1225,THE REGENT,Upon my bridal night. I would you'd whisper
1226,THE REGENT,The rogueries your tongue invented then.
1227,THE REGENT,"I have few moments, girl ... I'd have them wanton."
1228,THE REGENT,Make jest this mantle hides the maid I was.
1229,THE REGENT,"I'll have no priest, no doctor--Fetch Tonino!"
1230,THE REGENT,I must present his son--
1231,THE REGENT,[_Lucetta runs out._
1232,THE REGENT,All's acted quick:
1233,THE REGENT,"Bride-bed, conception, birth--and death! But he"
1234,THE REGENT,Shall sum it in one moment death not takes ...
1235,THE REGENT,What noise of trumpets!... Is the wound not covered?
1236,THE REGENT,
1237,THE REGENT,[_She wraps herself carefully in her mantle as the
1238,THE REGENT,courtiers pour in. The child Tonino runs to
1239,THE REGENT,"her and stands by her side. Lucio, Cesario,"
1240,THE REGENT,"all the Court, group themselves round her as"
1241,THE REGENT,the Duke enters. He rushes in eagerly; but
1242,THE REGENT,"she sets her teeth on her anguish, and receives"
1243,THE REGENT,him with a low reverence._
1244,THE REGENT,
1245,THE REGENT,Welcome my lord!
1246,THE REGENT,
1247,THE REGENT,_Duke._ Ottilia!
1248,THE REGENT,
1249,THE REGENT,"_Regent._ Good my lord,"
1250,THE REGENT,Welcome! This day is bright restores you to
1251,THE REGENT,Your loyal Duchy.
1252,THE REGENT,
1253,THE REGENT,Duke (_impatient_). Wife! Ottilia!
1254,THE REGENT,
1255,THE REGENT,_Regent_ (_she lifts a hand to keep him at distance_).
1256,THE REGENT,"There must be forms, my lord--some forms! Cesario,"
1257,THE REGENT,"Render the Duke his sceptre. As bar to socket,"
1258,THE REGENT,"When the gate closes on a town secure,"
1259,THE REGENT,So locks this rod back to his manly clutch--
1260,THE REGENT,"Cry all, 'Long live the Duke!'"
1261,THE REGENT,
1262,THE REGENT,_All._ Long live the Duke!
1263,THE REGENT,
1264,THE REGENT,"_Duke._ Wife, make an end with forms!"
1265,THE REGENT,
1266,THE REGENT,_Lucio_ (_to Cesario_). And so say I!
1267,THE REGENT,A man would think my sister had no blood
1268,THE REGENT,In her body.
1269,THE REGENT,
1270,THE REGENT,"_Cesario_ (_watching the Regent_). Peace, man: something"
1271,THE REGENT,there's amiss.
1272,THE REGENT,
1273,THE REGENT,_Regent._ Yet here is he that sceptre shall inherit.
1274,THE REGENT,"Lucetta, lead his first-born to the Duke."
1275,THE REGENT,His first-born!--Nay but look on him how straight
1276,THE REGENT,"Of limb, how set and shoulder-square, tho' slender!"
1277,THE REGENT,"He'll sit a horse, in time, and toss a lance"
1278,THE REGENT,Even with his father.
1279,THE REGENT,
1280,THE REGENT,"_Duke._ There's my blessing, boy!"
1281,THE REGENT,"But stand aside. Look in my face, Ottilia--"
1282,THE REGENT,"Hearken me, all! One thing these seven years"
1283,THE REGENT,"My life hath lacked, which wanting, all your cannon,"
1284,THE REGENT,"Your banners, _vivas_, bells that rock the roofs,"
1285,THE REGENT,"Throng'd windows, craning faces--all--all--all"
1286,THE REGENT,"Were phantasms, were noise.--"
1287,THE REGENT,
1288,THE REGENT,"_Lucio_ (_exclaims_). Why look, here's blood!"
1289,THE REGENT,"Here, on the boy's hand!"
1290,THE REGENT,
1291,THE REGENT,"_Regent._   Ay! a scratch, no worse,"
1292,THE REGENT,"Here, when I pinned my robe."
1293,THE REGENT,
1294,THE REGENT,"_Duke_ (_continuing_). Nay, friends, this moment"
1295,THE REGENT,My Duchy her dear hand restores to me
1296,THE REGENT,To me's a dream. More buoyant would I tread
1297,THE REGENT,"Dumb street, deserted square, climb ruin'd wall,"
1298,THE REGENT,Where in a heap beneath a broken flag
1299,THE REGENT,Lay Adria.--
1300,THE REGENT,So that amid the ruins stood my love
1301,THE REGENT,And stretched her hands so faintly--stretched her hands
1302,THE REGENT,So faintly. See! She's mine! She lifts them--
1303,THE REGENT,
1304,THE REGENT,"_Regent_ (_totters and falls into his arms with a tired, happy"
1305,THE REGENT,"laugh, which ends in a cry as his arms enfold her_). Ah!"
1306,THE REGENT,
1307,THE REGENT,[_She faints._
1308,THE REGENT,
1309,THE REGENT,"_Duke_. (_after a moment, releasing her a little_). What's"
1310,THE REGENT,here? Ottilia!
1311,THE REGENT,
1312,THE REGENT,_Lucetta._ My mistress swoons!
1313,THE REGENT,
1314,THE REGENT,_A Courtier._ 'Tis happiness--
1315,THE REGENT,
1316,THE REGENT,_Duke._ Fetch water!
1317,THE REGENT,
1318,THE REGENT,_Lucio._ Nay this blood--
1319,THE REGENT,Came of no scratch!
1320,THE REGENT,
1321,THE REGENT,_Lucetta._ Loosen her bodice--
1322,THE REGENT,
1323,THE REGENT,_Duke._ Blood?
1324,THE REGENT,Why blood? Where's blood?
1325,THE REGENT,
1326,THE REGENT,(_Stares as the mantle is imclasped and falls open_).
1327,THE REGENT,"Ah, my God!"
1328,THE REGENT,
1329,THE REGENT,_Lucetta._ Murder! murder!
1330,THE REGENT,The Countess Fulvia--
1331,THE REGENT,
1332,THE REGENT,_Cesario._ Speak!
1333,THE REGENT,
1334,THE REGENT,_Lucetta._ There--while she knelt--
1335,THE REGENT,"Stabbed her, and fled."
1336,THE REGENT,
1337,THE REGENT,_Cesario._ Which way?
1338,THE REGENT,
1339,THE REGENT,[_Lucetta points to the stairs. He dashes off in
1340,THE REGENT,pursuit._
1341,THE REGENT,
1342,THE REGENT,_Duke._ All-seeing God!
1343,THE REGENT,"Where were thine eyes, or else thy justice? Dead?"
1344,THE REGENT,"O, never dead!"
1345,THE REGENT,
1346,THE REGENT,"_Lucio._ Ay, Duke, push God aside,"
1347,THE REGENT,As I push thee. I have the better right:
1348,THE REGENT,"I killed her--I. O never pass, sweet soul,"
1349,THE REGENT,"Till thou hast drunk a shudder of this wretch,"
1350,THE REGENT,"Thy brother, playmate, murderer!"
1351,THE REGENT,
1352,THE REGENT,_Duke._ Wine! bring wine--
1353,THE REGENT,
1354,THE REGENT,_Regent_ (_as the wine is brought and revives her_).
1355,THE REGENT,"Flower, he will crush thee--but the bliss, the bliss!"
1356,THE REGENT,I swim in bliss. What ... Lucio? Where's my lord?
1357,THE REGENT,"Dear, bring him: he was here awhile and held me."
1358,THE REGENT,"Say he must hold, or the light air will lift"
1359,THE REGENT,And bear me quite away.
1360,THE REGENT,
1361,THE REGENT,[_Re-enter Cesario. In one hand he carries his
1362,THE REGENT,"sword, in the other a dagger._"
1363,THE REGENT,
1364,THE REGENT,_Lucio._ Cesario!
1365,THE REGENT,What! Is that devil escaped? To think--to think
1366,THE REGENT,I drank her kisses!--What? Where is she?
1367,THE REGENT,
1368,THE REGENT,_Cesario._ Dead.
1369,THE REGENT,I raised the cry: the people pointed after;
1370,THE REGENT,"Ran with me, ravening. Just this side the bridge"
1371,THE REGENT,She heard our howl and turned--drew back the dagger
1372,THE REGENT,"Red with our lady's blood, then drove it home"
1373,THE REGENT,Clean to her own black heart.
1374,THE REGENT,
1375,THE REGENT,_Regent._   God pardon her!
1376,THE REGENT,I would what blood of mine clung to the blade
1377,THE REGENT,Might mix with hers and sweeten it for mercy.
1378,THE REGENT,
1379,THE REGENT,_Lucio._ Will you forgive her? Then forgive not me!
1380,THE REGENT,
1381,THE REGENT,_Regent._ Dear Lucio!--You'll not pluck away your hand
1382,THE REGENT,"This time? Hush! Where's Cesario?... Friend, farewell."
1383,THE REGENT,Where lies the body?
1384,THE REGENT,
1385,THE REGENT,"_Cesario._ Sooth, madonna, I flung it"
1386,THE REGENT,"To the river's will, to roll it down to sea"
1387,THE REGENT,"Or cast on muddy bar, for dogs to gnaw."
1388,THE REGENT,
1389,THE REGENT,_Regent._ The river? Ah! How strong the river rolls!
1390,THE REGENT,"Hold me, my lord--"
1391,THE REGENT,
1392,THE REGENT,"_Duke._ Love, love, I hold you"
1393,THE REGENT,
1394,THE REGENT,_Regent._--Ay!
1395,THE REGENT,"The child, too--You will hold the child?..."
1396,THE REGENT,This roar
1397,THE REGENT,Deafens but will not drown us.

2462,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2463,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2464,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,You and I and Burd so blithe--
2465,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Burd so blithe, and you, and I--"
2466,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,The Mower he would whet his scythe
2467,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Before the dew was dry.
2468,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2469,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"And he woke soon, but we woke soon"
2470,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"And drew the nursery blind,"
2471,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,All wondering at the waning moon
2472,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,With the small June roses twined:
2473,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Low in her cradle swung the moon
2474,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,With an elfin dawn behind.
2475,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2476,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"In whispers, while our elders slept,"
2477,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"We knelt and said our prayers,"
2478,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And dress'd us and on tiptoe crept
2479,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Adown the creaking stairs.
2480,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2481,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"The world's possessors lay abed,"
2482,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And all the world was ours--
2483,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"""Nay, nay, but hark! the Mower's tread!"
2484,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"And we must save the flowers!"""
2485,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2486,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,The Mower knew not rest nor haste--
2487,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,That old unweary man:
2488,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,But we were young. We paused and raced
2489,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And gather'd while we ran.
2490,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2491,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"O youth is careless, youth is fleet,"
2492,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,With heart and wing of bird!
2493,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"The lark flew up beneath our feet,"
2494,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,To his copse the pheasant whirr'd;
2495,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2496,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,The cattle from their darkling lairs
2497,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Heaved up and stretch'd themselves;
2498,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Almost they trod at unawares
2499,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Upon the busy elves
2500,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2501,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"That dropp'd their spools of gossamer,"
2502,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"To dangle and to dry,"
2503,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And scurried home to the hollow fir
2504,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Where the white owl winks an eye.
2505,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2506,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Nor you, nor I, nor Burd so blithe"
2507,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Had driven them in this haste;
2508,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"But the old, old man, so lean and lithe,"
2509,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,That afar behind us paced;
2510,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"So lean and lithe, with shoulder'd scythe,"
2511,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And a whetstone at his waist.
2512,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2513,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Within the gate, in a grassy round"
2514,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Whence they had earliest flown,"
2515,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"He upside-down'd his scythe, and ground"
2516,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Its edge with careful hone.
2517,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"But we heeded not, if we heard, the sound,"
2518,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,For the world was ours alone;
2519,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,The world was ours!--and with a bound
2520,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,The conquering Sun upshone!
2521,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2522,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And while as from his level ray
2523,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,We stood our eyes to screen.
2524,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,The world was not as yesterday
2525,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Our homelier world had been--
2526,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,So grey and golden-green it lay
2527,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"All in his quiet sheen,"
2528,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"That wove the gold into the grey,"
2529,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,The grey into the green.
2530,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Sure never hand of Puck, nor wand"
2531,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Of Mab the fairies' queen,"
2532,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Nor prince nor peer of fairyland
2533,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Had power to weave that wide riband
2534,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Of the grey, the gold, the green."
2535,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2536,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,But the Gods of Greece had been before
2537,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"And walked our meads along,"
2538,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,The great authentic Gods of yore
2539,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,That haunt the earth from shore to shore
2540,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Trailing their robes of song.
2541,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2542,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"And where a sandall'd foot had brush'd,"
2543,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"And where a scarfed hem,"
2544,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,The flowers awoke from sleep and rush'd
2545,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Like children after them.
2546,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2547,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Pell-mell they poured by vale and stream,"
2548,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,By lawn and steepy brae--
2549,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"""O children, children! while you dream,"
2550,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Your flowers run all away!"""
2551,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2552,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,But afar and abed and sleepily
2553,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,The children heard us call;
2554,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And Burd so blithe and you and I
2555,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Must be gatherers for all.
2556,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2557,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"The meadow-sweet beside the hedge,"
2558,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"The dog-rose and the vetch,"
2559,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"The sworded iris 'mid the sedge,"
2560,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,The mallow by the ditch--
2561,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2562,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"With these, and by the wimpling burn,"
2563,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Where the midges danced in reels,"
2564,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,With the watermint and the lady fern
2565,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,We brimm'd out wicker creels:
2566,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2567,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Till, all so heavily they weigh'd,"
2568,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"On a bank we flung us down,"
2569,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Shook out our treasures 'neath the shade
2570,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And wove this Triple Crown.
2571,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2572,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Flower after flower--for some there were
2573,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"The noonday heats had dried,"
2574,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And some were dear yet could not bear
2575,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"A lovelier cheek beside,"
2576,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And some were perfect past compare--
2577,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Ah, darlings! what a world of care"
2578,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,It cost us to decide!
2579,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2580,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Natheless we sang in sweet accord,"
2581,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Each bending o'er her brede--
2582,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"""O there be flowers in Oxenford,"
2583,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"And flowers be north of Tweed,"
2584,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And flowers there be on earthly sward
2585,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"That owe no mortal seed!"""
2586,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2587,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"And these, the brightest that we wove,"
2588,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Were Innocence and Truth,"
2589,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"And holy Peace and angel Love,"
2590,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Glad Hope and gentle Ruth.
2591,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Ah, bind them fast with triple twine"
2592,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Of Memory, the wild woodbine"
2593,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"That still, being human, stays divine,"
2594,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And alone is age's youth!...
2595,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2596,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,But hark! but look! the warning rook
2597,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Wings home in level flight;
2598,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,The children tired with play and book
2599,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Have kiss'd and call'd Good-night!
2600,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2601,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Ah, sisters, look! What fields be these"
2602,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,That lie so sad and shorn?
2603,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"What hand has cut our coppices,"
2604,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"And thro' the trimm'd, the ruin'd, trees"
2605,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Lets wail a wind forlorn?
2606,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2607,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"'Tis Time, 'tis Time has done this crime"
2608,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And laid our meadows waste--
2609,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"The bent unwearied tyrant Time,"
2610,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,That knows nor rest nor haste.
2611,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2612,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Yet courage, children; homeward bring"
2613,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Your hearts, your garlands high;"
2614,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,For we have dared to do a thing
2615,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,That shall his worst defy.
2616,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2617,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,We cannot nail the dial's hand;
2618,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,We cannot bind the sun
2619,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"By Gibeon to stay and stand,"
2620,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Or the moon o'er Ajalon;
2621,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2622,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"We cannot blunt th' abhorred shears,"
2623,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Nor shift the skeins of Fate,"
2624,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Nor say unto the posting years
2625,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"""Ye shall not desolate."""
2626,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2627,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"We cannot cage the lion's rage,"
2628,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Nor teach the turtle-dove
2629,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Beside what well his moan to tell
2630,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Or to haunt one only grove;
2631,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,But the lion's brood will range for food
2632,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,As the fledged bird will rove.
2633,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2634,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And east and west we three may wend--
2635,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Yet we a wreath have wound
2636,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,For us shall wind withouten end
2637,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"The wide, wide world around:"
2638,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,
2639,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Be it east or west, and ne'er so far,"
2640,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"In east or west shall peep no star,"
2641,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"No blossom break from ground,"
2642,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,But minds us of the wreath we wove
2643,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Of innocence and holy love
2644,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"That in the meads we found,"
2645,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"And handsell'd from the Mower's scythe,"
2646,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And bound with memory's living withe--
2647,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,You and I and Burd so blithe--
2648,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Three maidens on a mound:
2649,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And all of happiness was ours
2650,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,"Shall find remembrance 'mid the flowers,"
2651,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,Shall take revival from the flowers
2652,A CHAPLET OF VERSE,And by the flowers be crown'd.
