16,PREFACE:,PREFACE: 
17,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI. 
18,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"AN ingenuous reviewer once described some verses of mine as “unwholesome,” because, he said, they had “a faint smell of Patchouli about them.” I am a little sorry he chose Patchouli, for that is not a particularly favourite scent with me. If he had only chosen Peau d’Espagne, which has a subtle meaning, or Lily of the Valley, with which I have associations! But Patchouli will serve. Let me ask, then, in republishing, with additions, a collection of little pieces, many of which have been objected to, at one time or another, as being somewhat deliberately frivolous, why art should not, if it please, concern itself with the artificially charming, which, I suppose, is what my critic means by Patchouli? All art, surely, is a form of artifice, and thus, to the truly devout mind, condemned already, if not as actively noxious, at all events as needless. That is a point of view which I quite understand, and its conclusion I hold to be absolutely logical. I have the utmost respect for the people who refuse to read a novel, to go to the theatre, or to learn dancing. That is to have convictions and to live up to them. I understand also the point of view from which a work of art is tolerated in so far as it is actually militant on behalf of a religious or a moral idea. But what I fail to understand are those delicate, invisible degrees by which a distinction is drawn between this form of art and that; the hesitations, and compromises, and timorous advances, and shocked retreats, of the Puritan conscience once emancipated, and yet afraid of liberty. However you may try to convince yourself to the contrary, a work of art can be judged only from two standpoints: the standpoint from which its art is measured entirely by its morality, and the standpoint from which its morality is measured entirely by its art. "
19,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"Here, for once, in connection with these “Silhouettes,” I have not, if my recollection serves me, been accused of actual immorality. I am but a fair way along the “primrose path,” not yet within singeing distance of the “everlasting bonfire.” In other words, I have not yet written “London Nights,” which, it appears (I can scarcely realize it, in my innocent abstraction in aesthetical matters), has no very salutary reputation among the blameless moralists of the press. I need not, therefore, on this occasion, concern myself with more than the curious fallacy by which there is supposed to be something inherently wrong in artistic work which deals frankly and lightly with the very real charm of the lighter emotions and the more fleeting sensations. "
20,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"I do not wish to assert that the kind of verse which happened to reflect certain moods of mine at a certain period of my life, is the best kind of verse in itself, or is likely to seem to me, in other years, when other moods may have made me their own, the best kind of verse for my own expression of myself. Nor do I affect to doubt that the creation of the supreme emotion is a higher form of art than the reflection of the most exquisite sensation, the evocation of the most magical impression. I claim only an equal liberty for the rendering of every mood of that variable and inexplicable and contradictory creature which we call ourselves, of every aspect under which we are gifted or condemned to apprehend the beauty and strangeness and curiosity of the visible world. "
21,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"Patchouli! Well, why not Patchouli? Is there any “reason in nature” why we should write exclusively about the natural blush, if the delicately acquired blush of rouge has any attraction for us? Both exist; both, I think, are charming in their way; and the latter, as a subject, has, at all events, more novelty. If you prefer your “new-mown hay” in the hayfield, and I, it may be, in a scent-bottle, why may not my individual caprice be allowed to find expression as well as yours? Probably I enjoy the hayfield as much as you do; but I enjoy quite other scents and sensations as well, and I take the former for granted, and write my poem, for a change, about the latter. There is no necessary difference in artistic value between a good poem about a flower in the hedge and a good poem about the scent in a sachet. I am always charmed to read beautiful poems about nature in the country. Only, personally, I prefer town to country; and in the town we have to find for ourselves, as best we may, the _décor_ which is the town equivalent of the great natural _décor_ of fields and hills. Here it is that artificiality comes in; and if any one sees no beauty in the effects of artificial light, in all the variable, most human, and yet most factitious town landscape, I can only pity him, and go on my own way. "
22,BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.,"That is, if he will let me. But he tells me that one thing is right and the other is wrong; that one is good art and the other is bad; and I listen in amazement, sometimes not without impatience, wondering why an estimable personal prejudice should be thus exalted into a dogma, and uttered in the name of art. For in art there can be no prejudices, only results. If we arc to save people’s souls by the writing of verses, well and good. But if not, there is no choice but to admit an absolute freedom of choice. And if Patchouli pleases one, why not Patchouli? "

25,AT DIEPPE.,AT DIEPPE. 
26,AFTER SUNSET.,AFTER SUNSET. 
27,AFTER SUNSET.,THE sea lies quieted beneath The after-sunset flush That leaves upon the heaped grey clouds The grape’s faint purple blush. 
28,AFTER SUNSET.,"Pale, from a little space in heaven Of delicate ivory, The sickle-moon and one gold star Look down upon the sea. "
29,ON THE BEACH.,ON THE BEACH. 
30,ON THE BEACH.,"NIGHT, a grey sky, a ghostly sea, The soft beginning of the rain: Black on the horizon, sails that wane Into the distance mistily. "
31,ON THE BEACH.,"The tide is rising, I can hear The soft roar broadening far along; It cries and murmurs in my car A sleepy old forgotten song. "
32,ON THE BEACH.,"Softly the stealthy night descends, The black sails fade into the sky: Is this not, where the sea-line ends, The shore-line of infinity? "
33,ON THE BEACH.,"I cannot think or dream: the grey Unending waste of sea and night, Dull, impotently infinite, Blots out the very hope of day. "
34,RAIN ON THE DOWN.,RAIN ON THE DOWN. 
35,RAIN ON THE DOWN.,"NIGHT, and the down by the sea, And the veil of rain on the down; And she came through the mist and the rain to me From the safe warm lights of the town. "
36,RAIN ON THE DOWN.,"The rain shone in her hair, And her face gleamed in the rain; And only the night and the rain were there As she came to me out of the rain. "
37,BEFORE THE SQUALL.,BEFORE THE SQUALL. 
38,BEFORE THE SQUALL.,"THE wind is rising on the sea, White flashes dance along the deep, That moans as if uneasily It turned in an unquiet sleep. "
39,BEFORE THE SQUALL.,Ridge after rocky ridge upheaves A toppling crest that falls in spray Where the tormented beach receives The buffets of the sea’s wild play. 
40,BEFORE THE SQUALL.,"On the horizon’s nearing line, Where the sky rests, a visible wall. Grey in the offing, I divine The sails that fly before the squall. "
41,UNDER THE CLIFFS.,UNDER THE CLIFFS. 
42,UNDER THE CLIFFS.,"BRIGHT light to windward on the horizon’s verge; To leeward, stormy shadows, violet-black, And the wide sea between A vast unfurrowed field of windless green; The stormy shadows flicker on the track Of phantom sails that vanish and emerge. "
43,UNDER THE CLIFFS.,"I gaze across the sea, remembering her. I watch the white sun walk across the sea, This pallid afternoon, With feet that tread as whitely as the moon, And in his fleet and shining feet I see The footsteps of another voyager. "
44,REQUIES.,REQUIES. 
45,REQUIES.,"O IS it death or life That sounds like something strangely known In this subsiding out of strife, This slow sea-monotone? "
46,REQUIES.,"A sound, scarce heard through sleep, Murmurous as the August bees That fill the forest hollows deep About the roots of trees. "
47,REQUIES.,"O is it life or death, O is it hope or memory, That quiets all things with this breath Of the eternal sea? "
48,MASKS AND FACES.,MASKS AND FACES. 
49,PASTEL.,PASTEL. 
50,PASTEL.,THE light of our cigarettes Went and came in the gloom: It was dark in the little room. 
51,PASTEL.,"Dark, and then, in the dark, Sudden, a flash, a glow, And a hand and a ring I know. "
52,PASTEL.,"And then, through the dark, a flush Ruddy and vague, the grace— A rose—of her lyric face. "
53,HER EYES.,HER EYES. 
54,HER EYES.,"BENEATH the heaven of her brows’ Unclouded noon of peace, there lies A leafy heaven of hazel boughs In the seclusion of her eyes; "
55,HER EYES.,Her troubling eyes that cannot rest; And there’s a little flame that dances (A firefly in a grassy nest) In the green circle of her glances; 
56,HER EYES.,"A frolic Faun that must be hid, Shyly, in some fantastic shade, Where pity droops a tender lid On laughter of itself afraid. "
57,MORBIDEZZA.,MORBIDEZZA. 
58,MORBIDEZZA.,"WHITE girl, your flesh is lilies Grown ’neath a frozen moon, So still is The rapture of your swoon Of whiteness, snow or lilies. "
59,MORBIDEZZA.,"The virginal revealment, Your bosom’s wavering slope, Concealment, ’Neath fainting heliotrope, Of whitest white’s revealment, "
60,MORBIDEZZA.,"Is like a bed of lilies, A jealous-guarded row, Whose will is Simply chaste dreams:—but oh, The alluring scent of lilies! "
61,MAQUILLAGE.,MAQUILLAGE. 
62,MAQUILLAGE.,"THE charm of rouge on fragile cheeks, Pearl-powder, and, about the eyes, The dark and lustrous Eastern dyes; The floating odour that bespeaks A scented boudoir and the doubtful night Of alcoves curtained close against the light "
63,MAQUILLAGE.,"Gracile and creamy white and rose, Complexioned like the flower of dawn, Her fleeting colours are as those That, from an April sky withdrawn, Fade in a fragrant mist of tears away When weeping noon leads on the altered day. "
64,IMPRESSION.,IMPRESSION. 
65,TO M. C.,TO M. C. 
66,TO M. C.,"THE pink and black of silk and lace, Flushed in the rosy-golden glow Of lamplight on her lifted face; Powder and wig, and pink and lace, "
67,TO M. C.,And those pathetic eyes of hers; But all the London footlights know The little plaintive smile that stirs The shadow in those eyes of hers. 
68,TO M. C.,"Outside, the dreary church-bell tolled, The London Sunday faded slow; Ah, what is this? what wings unfold In this miraculous rose of gold? "
69,AN ANGEL OF PERUGINO.,AN ANGEL OF PERUGINO. 
70,AN ANGEL OF PERUGINO.,"HAVE I not seen your face before Where Perugino’s angels stand In those calm circles, and adore With singing throat and lifted hand? "
71,AN ANGEL OF PERUGINO.,"So the pale hair lay crescent-wise, About the placid forehead curled, And the pale piety of eyes Was as God’s peace upon the world. "
72,AN ANGEL OF PERUGINO.,"And you, a simple child serene, Wander upon your quiet way, Nor know that any eyes have seen The Umbrian halo crown the day. "
73,AT FONTAINEBLEAU.,AT FONTAINEBLEAU. 
74,AT FONTAINEBLEAU.,"IT was a day of sun and rain, Uncertain as a child’s quick moods; And I shall never pass again So blithe a day among the woods. "
75,AT FONTAINEBLEAU.,"The forest knew you and was glad, And laughed for very joy to know Her child was with her; then, grown sad, She wept, because her child must go. "
76,AT FONTAINEBLEAU.,And you would spy and you would capture The shyest flower that lit the grass: The joy I had to watch your rapture Was keen as even your rapture was. 
77,AT FONTAINEBLEAU.,"The forest knew you and was glad, And laughed and wept for joy and woe. This was the welcome that you had Among the woods of Fontainebleau. "
78,ON THE HEATH.,ON THE HEATH. 
79,ON THE HEATH.,"HER face’s wilful flash and glow Turned all its light upon my face One bright delirious moment’s space, And then she passed: I followed slow "
80,ON THE HEATH.,"Across the heath, and up and round, And watched the splendid death of day Upon the summits far away, And in her fateful beauty found "
81,ON THE HEATH.,"The fierce wild beauty of the light That startles twilight on the hills, And lightens all the mountain rills, And flames before the feet of night. "
82,IN THE ORATORY.,IN THE ORATORY. 
83,IN THE ORATORY.,"THE incense mounted like a cloud, A golden cloud of languid scent; Robed priests before the altar bowed, Expecting the divine event. "
84,IN THE ORATORY.,"Then silence, like a prisoner bound, Rose, by a mighty hand set free, And dazzlingly, in shafts of sound, Thundered Beethoven’s Mass in C. "
85,IN THE ORATORY.,"She knelt in prayer; large lids serene Lay heavy on the sombre eyes, As though to veil some vision seen Upon the mounts of Paradise. "
86,IN THE ORATORY.,"Her dark face, calm as carven stone. The face that twilight shows the day, Brooded, mysteriously alone, And infinitely far away. "
87,IN THE ORATORY.,"Inexplicable eyes that drew Mine eyes adoring, why from me Demand, new Sphinx, the fatal clue That seals my doom or conquers thee? "
88,PATTIE.,PATTIE. 
89,PATTIE.,"COOL comely country Pattie, grown A daisy where the daisies grow, No wind of heaven has ever blown Across a field-flower’s daintier snow. "
90,PATTIE.,"Gold-white among the meadow-grass The humble little daisies thrive; I cannot see them as I pass, But I am glad to be alive. "
91,PATTIE.,"And so I turn where Pattie stands, A flower among the flowers at play; I’ll lay my heart into her hands, And she will smile the clouds away. "
92,IN AN OMNIBUS.,IN AN OMNIBUS. 
93,IN AN OMNIBUS.,"YOUR smile is like a treachery, A treachery adorable; So smiles the siren where the sea Sings to the unforgetting shell. "
94,IN AN OMNIBUS.,"Your fleeting Leonardo face, Parisian Monna Lisa, dreams Elusively, but not of streams Born in a shadow-haunted place. "
95,IN AN OMNIBUS.,"Of Paris, Paris, is your thought, Of Paris robes, and when to wear The latest bonnet you have bought To match the marvel of your hair. "
96,IN AN OMNIBUS.,"Yet that fine malice of your smile, That faint and fluctuating glint Between your eyelids, does it hint Alone of matters mercantile? "
97,IN AN OMNIBUS.,"Close lips that keep the secret in, Half spoken by the stealthy eyes, Is there indeed no word to win, No secret, from the vague replies "
98,IN AN OMNIBUS.,"Of lips and lids that feign to hide That which they feign to render up? Is there, in Tantalus’ dim cup, The shadow of water, nought beside? "
99,ON MEETING AFTER.,ON MEETING AFTER. 
100,ON MEETING AFTER.,"HER eyes are haunted, eyes that were Scarce sad when last we met. What thing is this has come to her That she may not forget? "
101,ON MEETING AFTER.,"They loved, they married: it is well! But ah, what memories Are these whereof her eyes half tell, Her haunted eyes? "
102,IN BOHEMIA.,IN BOHEMIA. 
103,IN BOHEMIA.,"DRAWN blinds and flaring gas within, And wine, and women, and cigars; Without, the city’s heedless din; Above, the white unheeding stars. "
104,IN BOHEMIA.,"And we, alike from each remote, The world that works, the heaven that waits, Con our brief pleasures o’er by rote, The favourite pastime of the Fates. "
105,IN BOHEMIA.,"We smoke, to fancy that we dream, And drink, a moment’s joy to prove, And fain would love, and only seem To love because we cannot love. "
106,IN BOHEMIA.,"Draw back the blinds, put out the light: ’Tis morning, let the daylight come. God! how the women’s cheeks are white, And how the sunlight strikes us dumb! "
107,EMMY.,EMMY. 
108,EMMY.,"EMMY’S exquisite youth and her virginal air, Eyes and teeth in the flash of a musical smile, Come to me out of the past, and I see her there As I saw her once for a while. "
109,EMMY.,"Emmy’s laughter rings in my ears, as bright, Fresh and sweet as the voice of a mountain brook, And still I hear her telling us tales that night, Out of Boccaccio’s book. "
110,EMMY.,"There, in the midst of the villainous dancing-hall, Leaning across the table, over the beer, While the music maddened the whirling skirts of the ball, As the midnight hour drew near, "
111,EMMY.,"There with the women, haggard, painted and old, One fresh bud in a garland withered and stale, She, with her innocent voice and her clear eyes, told Tale after shameless tale. "
112,EMMY.,"And ever the witching smile, to her face beguiled, Paused and broadened, and broke in a ripple of fun, And the soul of a child looked out of the eyes of a child, Or ever the tale was done. "
113,EMMY.,"O my child, who wronged you first, and began First the dance of death that you dance so well? Soul for soul: and I think the soul of a man Shall answer for yours in hell. "
114,EMMY AT THE ELDORADO.,EMMY AT THE ELDORADO. 
115,EMMY AT THE ELDORADO.,"TO meet, of all unlikely things, Here, after all one’s wanderings! But, Emmy, though we meet, What of this lover at your feet? "
116,EMMY AT THE ELDORADO.,"For, is this Emmy that I see? A fragile domesticity I seem to half surprise In the evasions of those eyes. "
117,EMMY AT THE ELDORADO.,"Once a child’s cloudless eyes, they seem Lost in the blue depths of a dream, As though, for innocent hours, To stray with love among the flowers. "
118,EMMY AT THE ELDORADO.,"Without regret, without desire, In those old days of love on hire, Child, child, what will you do, Emmy, now love is come to you? "
119,EMMY AT THE ELDORADO.,"Already, in so brief a while, The gleam has faded from your smile; This grave and tender air Leaves you, for all but one, less fair. "
120,EMMY AT THE ELDORADO.,"Then, you were heedless, happy, gay, Immortally a child; to-day A woman, at the years’ control: Undine has found a soul. "
121,AT THE CAVOUR.,AT THE CAVOUR. 
122,AT THE CAVOUR.,"WINE, the red coals, the flaring gas, Bring out a brighter tone in cheeks That learn at home before the glass The flush that eloquently speaks. "
123,AT THE CAVOUR.,"The blue-grey smoke of cigarettes Curls from the lessening ends that glow; The men are thinking of the bets, The women of the debts, they owe. "
124,AT THE CAVOUR.,"Then their eyes meet, and in their eyes The accustomed smile comes up to call, A look half miserably wise. Half heedlessly ironical. "
125,IN THE HAYMARKET.,IN THE HAYMARKET. 
126,IN THE HAYMARKET.,"I DANCED at your ball a year ago, To-night I pay for your bread and cheese, “And a glass of bitters, if you please, For you drank my best champagne, you know!” "
127,IN THE HAYMARKET.,"Madcap ever, you laugh the while, As you drink your bitters and munch your bread; The face is the same, and the same old smile Came up at a word I said. "
128,IN THE HAYMARKET.,"A year ago I danced at your ball, I sit by your side in the bar to-night; And the luck has changed, you say: that’s all! And the luck will change, you say: all right! "
129,IN THE HAYMARKET.,"For the men go by, and the rent’s to pay, And you haven’t a friend in the world to-day; And the money comes and the money goes: And to-night, who cares? and to-morrow, who knows? "
130,AT THE LYCEUM.,AT THE LYCEUM. 
131,AT THE LYCEUM.,"HER eyes are brands that keep the angry heat Of fire that crawls and leaves an ashen path. The dust of this devouring flame she hath Upon her cheeks and eyelids. Fresh and sweet In days that were, her sultry beauty now Is pain transfigured, love’s impenitence, The memory of a maiden innocence, As a crown set upon a weary brow. "
132,AT THE LYCEUM.,"She sits, and fain would listen, fain forget; She smiles, but with those tragic, waiting eyes, Those proud and piteous lips that hunger yet For love’s fulfilment. Ah, when Landry cries “My heart is dead!” with what a wild regret Her own heart feels the throb that never dies! "
133,THE BLIND BEGGAR.,THE BLIND BEGGAR. 
134,THE BLIND BEGGAR.,"HE stands, a patient figure, where the crowd Heaves to and fro beside him. In his ears All day the Fair goes thundering, and he hears In darkness, as a dead man in his shroud. Patient he stands, with age and sorrow bowed, And holds a piteous hat of ancient yean; And in his face and gesture there appears The desperate humbleness of poor men proud. "
135,THE BLIND BEGGAR.,"What thoughts are his, as, with the inward sight, He sees those mirthful faces pass him by? Is the long darkness darker for that light. The misery deeper when that joy is nigh? Patient, alone, he stands from morn to night, Pleading in his reproachful misery. "
136,THE OLD LABOURER.,THE OLD LABOURER. 
137,THE OLD LABOURER.,"HIS fourscore years have bent a back of oak, His earth-brown cheeks are full of hollow pits; His gnarled hands wander idly as he sits Bending above the hearthstone’s feeble smoke. Threescore and ten slow years he tilled the land; He wrung his bread from out the stubborn soil; He saw his masters flourish through his toil; He held their substance in his horny hand. "
138,THE OLD LABOURER.,"Now he is old: he asks for daily bread: He who has sowed the bread he may not taste Begs for the crumbs: he would do no man wrong. The Parish Guardians, when his case is read, Will grant him (yet with no unseemly haste) Just seventeen pence to starve on, seven days long. "
139,THE ABSINTHE DRINKER.,THE ABSINTHE DRINKER. 
140,THE ABSINTHE DRINKER.,"GENTLY I wave the visible world away. Far off, I hear a roar, afar yet near, Far off and strange, a voice is in my ear, And is the voice my own? the words I say Fall strangely, like a dream, across the day; And the dim sunshine is a dream. How clear, New as the world to lovers’ eyes, appear The men and women passing on their way! "
141,THE ABSINTHE DRINKER.,"The world is very fair. The hours are all Linked in a dance of mere forgetfulness. I am at peace with God and man. O glide, Sands of the hour-glass that I count not, fall Serenely: scarce I feel your soft caress. Rocked on this dreamy and indifferent tide. "
142,"JAVANESE DANCERS,","JAVANESE DANCERS, "
143,"JAVANESE DANCERS,","TWITCHED strings, the clang of metal, beaten drums. Dull, shrill, continuous, disquieting; And now the stealthy dancer comes Undulantly with cat-like steps that cling; "
144,"JAVANESE DANCERS,","Smiling between her painted lids a smile, Motionless, unintelligible, she twines Her fingers into mazy lines, Twining her scarves across them all the while. "
145,"JAVANESE DANCERS,","One, two, three, four step forth, and, to and fro, Delicately and imperceptibly, Now swaying gently in a row, Now interthreading slow and rhythmically, "
146,"JAVANESE DANCERS,","Still with fixed eyes, monotonously still, Mysteriously, with smiles inanimate, With lingering feet that undulate, With sinuous fingers, spectral hands that thrill, "
147,"JAVANESE DANCERS,","The little amber-coloured dancers move, Like little painted figures on a screen, Or phantom-dancers haply seen Among the shadows of a magic grove. "
148,LOVE’S DISGUISES.,LOVE’S DISGUISES. 
149,LOVE IN SPRING.,LOVE IN SPRING. 
150,LOVE IN SPRING.,"GOOD to be loved and to love for a little, and then Well to forget, be forgotten, ere loving grow life! Dear, you have loved me, but was I the man among men? Sweet, I have loved you, but scarcely as mistress or wife. "
151,LOVE IN SPRING.,"Message of Spring in the hearts of a man and a maid, Hearts on a holiday: ho! let us love: it is Spring. Joy in the birds of the air, in the buds of the glade, Joy in our hearts in the joy of the hours on the wing. "

353,FOR A PICTURE OF WATTEAU.,"Light loves that woke with spring This autumn afternoon Beholds meandering, Still, to the strains of spring. "
354,FOR A PICTURE OF WATTEAU.,"Your dancing feet are faint, Lovers: the air recedes Into a sighing plaint, Faint, as your loves are faint. "
355,FOR A PICTURE OF WATTEAU.,"It is the end, the end, The dance of love’s decease. Feign no more now, fair friend! It is the end, the end. "
