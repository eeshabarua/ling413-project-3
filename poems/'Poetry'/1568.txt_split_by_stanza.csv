22,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"_My friend and publisher_, _Mr. Alfred Nutt_, _asks me to introduce this re-issue of old work in a new shape_.  _At his request_, _then_, _I have to say that nearly all the numbers contained in the present volume are reprinted from_ ‘_A Book of Verses_’ (1888) _and_ ‘_London Voluntaries_’ (1892–3).  _From the first of these I have removed some copies of verse which seemed to me scarce worth keeping_; _and I have recovered for it certain others from those publications which had made room for them_.  _I have corrected where I could_, _added such dates as I might_, _and_, _by re-arrangement and revision_, _done my best to give my book_, _such as it is_, _its final form_.  _If any be displeased by the result_, _I can but submit that my verses are my own_, _and that this is how I would have them read_. "
23,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"_The work of revision has reminded me that_, _small as is this book of mine_, _it is all in the matter of verse that I have to show for the years between_ 1872 _and_ 1897.  _A principal reason is that_, _after spending the better part of my life in the pursuit of poetry_, _I found myself_ (_about_ 1877) _so utterly unmarketable that I had to own myself beaten in art_, _and to addict myself to journalism for the next ten years_.  _Came the production by my old friend_, _Mr. H. B. Donkin_, _in his little collection of_ ‘_Voluntaries_’ (1888), _compiled for that East-End Hospital to which he has devoted so much time and energy and skill_, _of those unrhyming rhythms in which I had tried to quintessentialize_, _as_ (_I believe_) _one scarce can do in rhyme_, _my impressions of the Old Edinburgh Infirmary_.  _They had long __since been rejected by every editor of standing in London—I had well-nigh said in the world_; _but as soon as Mr. Nutt had read them_, _he entreated me to look for more_.  _I did as I was told_; _old dusty sheaves were dragged to light_; _the work of selection and correction was begun_; _I burned much_; _I found that_, _after all_, _the lyrical instinct had slept—not died_; _I ventured_ (_in brief_) ‘_A Book of Verses_.’  _It was received with so much interest that I took heart once more_, _and wrote the numbers presently reprinted from_ ‘_The National Observer_’ _in the collection first_ (1892) _called_ ‘_The Song of the Sword_’ _and afterwards_ (1893), ‘_London voluntaries_.’  _If I have said nothing since_, _it is that I have nothing to say which is not_, _as yet_, _too personal—too personal and too a afflicting—for utterance_. "
24,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"_For the matter of my book_, _it is there to speak for itself_:— "
25,_ADVERTISEMENT_,‘_Here’s a sigh to those who love me_ _And a smile to those who hate_.’ 
26,_ADVERTISEMENT_,_I refer to it for the simple pleasure of reflecting that it has made me many friends and some enemies_.

33,BALZAC.,BALZAC. 
34,ENTER PATIENT,I ENTER PATIENT 
35,ENTER PATIENT,"THE morning mists still haunt the stony street; The northern summer air is shrill and cold; And lo, the Hospital, grey, quiet, old, Where Life and Death like friendly chafferers meet. Thro’ the loud spaciousness and draughty gloom A small, strange child—so agèd yet so young!— Her little arm besplinted and beslung, Precedes me gravely to the waiting-room. I limp behind, my confidence all gone. The grey-haired soldier-porter waves me on, And on I crawl, and still my spirits fail: A tragic meanness seems so to environ These corridors and stairs of stone and iron, Cold, naked, clean—half-workhouse and half-jail. "
36,WAITING,II WAITING 
37,WAITING,"A SQUARE, squat room (a cellar on promotion), Drab to the soul, drab to the very daylight; Plasters astray in unnatural-looking tinware; Scissors and lint and apothecary’s jars. "
38,WAITING,"Here, on a bench a skeleton would writhe from, Angry and sore, I wait to be admitted: Wait till my heart is lead upon my stomach, While at their ease two dressers do their chores. "
39,WAITING,One has a probe—it feels to me a crowbar. A small boy sniffs and shudders after bluestone. A poor old tramp explains his poor old ulcers. Life is (I think) a blunder and a shame. 
40,INTERIOR,III INTERIOR 
41,INTERIOR,"THE gaunt brown walls Look infinite in their decent meanness. There is nothing of home in the noisy kettle, The fulsome fire. "
42,INTERIOR,"The atmosphere Suggests the trail of a ghostly druggist. Dressings and lint on the long, lean table— Whom are they for? "
43,INTERIOR,"The patients yawn, Or lie as in training for shroud and coffin. A nurse in the corridor scolds and wrangles. It’s grim and strange. "
44,INTERIOR,"Far footfalls clank. The bad burn waits with his head unbandaged. My neighbour chokes in the clutch of chloral . . . O, a gruesome world! "
45,BEFORE,IV BEFORE 
46,BEFORE,"BEHOLD me waiting—waiting for the knife. A little while, and at a leap I storm The thick, sweet mystery of chloroform, The drunken dark, the little death-in-life. The gods are good to me: I have no wife, No innocent child, to think of as I near The fateful minute; nothing all-too dear Unmans me for my bout of passive strife. Yet am I tremulous and a trifle sick, And, face to face with chance, I shrink a little: My hopes are strong, my will is something weak. Here comes the basket?  Thank you.  I am ready. But, gentlemen my porters, life is brittle: You carry Cæsar and his fortunes—steady! "
47,OPERATION,V OPERATION 
48,OPERATION,"YOU are carried in a basket, Like a carcase from the shambles, To the theatre, a cockpit Where they stretch you on a table. "
49,OPERATION,"Then they bid you close your eyelids, And they mask you with a napkin, And the anæsthetic reaches Hot and subtle through your being. "
50,OPERATION,"And you gasp and reel and shudder In a rushing, swaying rapture, While the voices at your elbow Fade—receding—fainter—farther. "
51,OPERATION,"Lights about you shower and tumble, And your blood seems crystallising— Edged and vibrant, yet within you Racked and hurried back and forward. "
52,OPERATION,"Then the lights grow fast and furious, And you hear a noise of waters, And you wrestle, blind and dizzy, In an agony of effort, "
53,OPERATION,"Till a sudden lull accepts you, And you sound an utter darkness . . . And awaken . . . with a struggle . . . On a hushed, attentive audience. "
54,AFTER,VI AFTER 
55,AFTER,"LIKE as a flamelet blanketed in smoke, So through the anæsthetic shows my life; So flashes and so fades my thought, at strife With the strong stupor that I heave and choke And sicken at, it is so foully sweet. Faces look strange from space—and disappear. Far voices, sudden loud, offend my ear— And hush as sudden.  Then my senses fleet: All were a blank, save for this dull, new pain That grinds my leg and foot; and brokenly Time and the place glimpse on to me again; And, unsurprised, out of uncertainty, I wake—relapsing—somewhat faint and fain, To an immense, complacent dreamery. "
56,VIGIL,VII VIGIL 
57,VIGIL,"LIVED on one’s back, In the long hours of repose, Life is a practical nightmare— Hideous asleep or awake. "
58,VIGIL,"Shoulders and loins Ache - - - ! Ache, and the mattress, Run into boulders and hummocks, Glows like a kiln, while the bedclothes— Tumbling, importunate, daft— Ramble and roll, and the gas, Screwed to its lowermost, An inevitable atom of light, Haunts, and a stertorous sleeper Snores me to hate and despair. "
59,VIGIL,"All the old time Surges malignant before me; Old voices, old kisses, old songs Blossom derisive about me; While the new days Pass me in endless procession: A pageant of shadows Silently, leeringly wending On . . . and still on . . . still on! "
60,VIGIL,"Far in the stillness a cat Languishes loudly.  A cinder Falls, and the shadows Lurch to the leap of the flame.  The next man to me Turns with a moan; and the snorer, The drug like a rope at his throat, Gasps, gurgles, snorts himself free, as the night-nurse, Noiseless and strange, Her bull’s eye half-lanterned in apron, (Whispering me, ‘Are ye no sleepin’ yet?’), Passes, list-slippered and peering, Round . . . and is gone. "
61,VIGIL,"Sleep comes at last— Sleep full of dreams and misgivings— Broken with brutal and sordid Voices and sounds that impose on me, Ere I can wake to it, The unnatural, intolerable day. "
62,STAFF-NURSE: OLD STYLE,VIII STAFF-NURSE: OLD STYLE 
63,STAFF-NURSE: OLD STYLE,"THE greater masters of the commonplace, REMBRANDT and good SIR WALTER—only these Could paint her all to you: experienced ease And antique liveliness and ponderous grace; The sweet old roses of her sunken face; The depth and malice of her sly, grey eyes; The broad Scots tongue that flatters, scolds, defies; The thick Scots wit that fells you like a mace. These thirty years has she been nursing here, Some of them under SYME, her hero still. Much is she worth, and even more is made of her. Patients and students hold her very dear. The doctors love her, tease her, use her skill. They say ‘The Chief’ himself is half-afraid of her. "
64,LADY-PROBATIONER,IX LADY-PROBATIONER 
65,LADY-PROBATIONER,"SOME three, or five, or seven, and thirty years; A Roman nose; a dimpling double-chin; Dark eyes and shy that, ignorant of sin, Are yet acquainted, it would seem, with tears; A comely shape; a slim, high-coloured hand, Graced, rather oddly, with a signet ring; A bashful air, becoming everything; A well-bred silence always at command. Her plain print gown, prim cap, and bright steel chain Look out of place on her, and I remain Absorbed in her, as in a pleasant mystery. Quick, skilful, quiet, soft in speech and touch . . . ‘Do you like nursing?’  ‘Yes, Sir, very much.’ Somehow, I rather think she has a history. "
66,STAFF-NURSE: NEW STYLE,X STAFF-NURSE: NEW STYLE 
67,STAFF-NURSE: NEW STYLE,"BLUE-EYED and bright of face but waning fast Into the sere of virginal decay, I view her as she enters, day by day, As a sweet sunset almost overpast. Kindly and calm, patrician to the last, Superbly falls her gown of sober gray, And on her chignon’s elegant array The plainest cap is somehow touched with caste. She talks BEETHOVEN; frowns disapprobation At BALZAC’S name, sighs it at ‘poor GEORGE SAND’S’; Knows that she has exceeding pretty hands; Speaks Latin with a right accentuation; And gives at need (as one who understands) Draught, counsel, diagnosis, exhortation. "
68,CLINICAL,XI CLINICAL 
69,HIST? . . .,"HIST? . . . Through the corridor’s echoes, Louder and nearer Comes a great shuffling of feet. Quick, every one of you, Strighten your quilts, and be decent! Here’s the Professor. "
70,HIST? . . .,"In he comes first With the bright look we know, From the broad, white brows the kind eyes Soothing yet nerving you.  Here at his elbow, White-capped, white-aproned, the Nurse, Towel on arm and her inkstand Fretful with quills. Here in the ruck, anyhow, Surging along, Louts, duffers, exquisites, students, and prigs— Whiskers and foreheads, scarf-pins and spectacles— Hustles the Class!  And they ring themselves Round the first bed, where the Chief (His dressers and clerks at attention), Bends in inspection already. "
71,HIST? . . .,"So shows the ring Seen from behind round a conjurer Doing his pitch in the street. High shoulders, low shoulders, broad shoulders, narrow ones, Round, square, and angular, serry and shove; While from within a voice, Gravely and weightily fluent, Sounds; and then ceases; and suddenly (Look at the stress of the shoulders!) Out of a quiver of silence, Over the hiss of the spray, Comes a low cry, and the sound Of breath quick intaken through teeth Clenched in resolve.  And the Master Breaks from the crowd, and goes, Wiping his hands, To the next bed, with his pupils Flocking and whispering behind him. "
72,HIST? . . .,"Now one can see. Case Number One Sits (rather pale) with his bedclothes Stripped up, and showing his foot (Alas for God’s Image!) Swaddled in wet, white lint Brilliantly hideous with red. "
73,ETCHING,XII ETCHING 
74,ETCHING,"TWO and thirty is the ploughman. He’s a man of gallant inches, And his hair is close and curly, And his beard; But his face is wan and sunken, And his eyes are large and brilliant, And his shoulder-blades are sharp, And his knees. "
75,ETCHING,"He is weak of wits, religious, Full of sentiment and yearning, Gentle, faded—with a cough And a snore. When his wife (who was a widow, And is many years his elder) Fails to write, and that is always, He desponds. "
76,ETCHING,"Let his melancholy wander, And he’ll tell you pretty stories Of the women that have wooed him Long ago; Or he’ll sing of bonnie lasses Keeping sheep among the heather, With a crackling, hackling click In his voice. "
77,CASUALTY,XIII CASUALTY 
78,CASUALTY,"AS with varnish red and glistening Dripped his hair; his feet looked rigid; Raised, he settled stiffly sideways: You could see his hurts were spinal. "
79,CASUALTY,"He had fallen from an engine, And been dragged along the metals. It was hopeless, and they knew it; So they covered him, and left him. "
80,CASUALTY,"As he lay, by fits half sentient, Inarticulately moaning, With his stockinged soles protruded Stark and awkward from the blankets, "
81,CASUALTY,"To his bed there came a woman, Stood and looked and sighed a little, And departed without speaking, As himself a few hours after. "
82,CASUALTY,"I was told it was his sweetheart. They were on the eve of marriage. She was quiet as a statue, But her lip was grey and writhen. "
83,AVE CAESER!,XIV AVE CAESER! 
84,AVE CAESER!,"FROM the winter’s grey despair, From the summer’s golden languor, Death, the lover of Life, Frees us for ever. "
85,AVE CAESER!,"Inevitable, silent, unseen, Everywhere always, Shadow by night and as light in the day, Signs she at last to her chosen; And, as she waves them forth, Sorrow and Joy Lay by their looks and their voices, Set down their hopes, and are made One in the dim Forever. "
86,AVE CAESER!,"Into the winter’s grey delight, Into the summer’s golden dream, Holy and high and impartial, Death, the mother of Life, Mingles all men for ever. "
87,‘THE CHIEF’,XV ‘THE CHIEF’ 
88,‘THE CHIEF’,"HIS brow spreads large and placid, and his eye Is deep and bright, with steady looks that still. Soft lines of tranquil thought his face fulfill— His face at once benign and proud and shy. If envy scout, if ignorance deny, His faultless patience, his unyielding will, Beautiful gentleness and splendid skill, Innumerable gratitudes reply. His wise, rare smile is sweet with certainties, And seems in all his patients to compel Such love and faith as failure cannot quell. We hold him for another Herakles, Battling with custom, prejudice, disease, As once the son of Zeus with Death and Hell. "
89,HOUSE-SURGEON,XVI HOUSE-SURGEON 
90,HOUSE-SURGEON,"EXCEEDING tall, but built so well his height Half-disappears in flow of chest and limb; Moustache and whisker trooper-like in trim; Frank-faced, frank-eyed, frank-hearted; always bright And always punctual—morning, noon, and night; Bland as a Jesuit, sober as a hymn; Humorous, and yet without a touch of whim; Gentle and amiable, yet full of fight. His piety, though fresh and true in strain, Has not yet whitewashed up his common mood To the dead blank of his particular Schism. Sweet, unaggressive, tolerant, most humane, Wild artists like his kindly elderhood, And cultivate his mild Philistinism. "
91,INTERLUDE,XVII INTERLUDE 
92,INTERLUDE,"O, THE fun, the fun and frolic That _The Wind that Shakes the Barley_ Scatters through a penny-whistle Tickled with artistic fingers! "
93,INTERLUDE,"Kate the scrubber (forty summers, Stout but sportive) treads a measure, Grinning, in herself a ballet, Fixed as fate upon her audience. "
94,INTERLUDE,"Stumps are shaking, crutch-supported; Splinted fingers tap the rhythm; And a head all helmed with plasters Wags a measured approbation. "
95,INTERLUDE,"Of their mattress-life oblivious, All the patients, brisk and cheerful, Are encouraging the dancer, And applauding the musician. "
96,INTERLUDE,"Dim the gas-lights in the output Of so many ardent smokers, Full of shadow lurch the corners, And the doctor peeps and passes. "
97,INTERLUDE,"There are, maybe, some suspicions Of an alcoholic presence . . . ‘Tak’ a sup of this, my wumman!’ . . . New Year comes but once a twelvemonth. "
98,CHILDREN: PRIVATE WARD,XVIII CHILDREN: PRIVATE WARD 
99,CHILDREN: PRIVATE WARD,"HERE in this dim, dull, double-bedded room, I play the father to a brace of boys, Ailing but apt for every sort of noise, Bedfast but brilliant yet with health and bloom. Roden, the Irishman, is ‘sieven past,’ Blue-eyed, snub-nosed, chubby, and fair of face. Willie’s but six, and seems to like the place, A cheerful little collier to the last. They eat, and laugh, and sing, and fight, all day; All night they sleep like dormice.  See them play At Operations:—Roden, the Professor, Saws, lectures, takes the artery up, and ties; Willie, self-chloroformed, with half-shut eyes, Holding the limb and moaning—Case and Dresser. "
100,SCRUBBER,XIX SCRUBBER 
101,SCRUBBER,"SHE’S tall and gaunt, and in her hard, sad face With flashes of the old fun’s animation There lowers the fixed and peevish resignation Bred of a past where troubles came apace. She tells me that her husband, ere he died, Saw seven of their children pass away, And never knew the little lass at play Out on the green, in whom he’s deified. Her kin dispersed, her friends forgot and gone, All simple faith her honest Irish mind, Scolding her spoiled young saint, she labours on: Telling her dreams, taking her patients’ part, Trailing her coat sometimes: and you shall find No rougher, quainter speech, nor kinder heart. "
102,VISITOR,XX VISITOR 
103,VISITOR,"HER little face is like a walnut shell With wrinkling lines; her soft, white hair adorns Her withered brows in quaint, straight curls, like horns; And all about her clings an old, sweet smell. Prim is her gown and quakerlike her shawl. Well might her bonnets have been born on her. Can you conceive a Fairy Godmother The subject of a strong religious call? In snow or shine, from bed to bed she runs, All twinkling smiles and texts and pious tales, Her mittened hands, that ever give or pray, Bearing a sheaf of tracts, a bag of buns: A wee old maid that sweeps the Bridegroom’s way, Strong in a cheerful trust that never fails. "
104,ROMANCE,XXI ROMANCE 
105,ROMANCE,"‘TALK of pluck!’ pursued the Sailor, Set at euchre on his elbow, ‘I was on the wharf at Charleston, Just ashore from off the runner. "
106,ROMANCE,"‘It was grey and dirty weather, And I heard a drum go rolling, Rub-a-dubbing in the distance, Awful dour-like and defiant. "
107,ROMANCE,"‘In and out among the cotton, Mud, and chains, and stores, and anchors, Tramped a squad of battered scarecrows— Poor old Dixie’s bottom dollar! "
108,ROMANCE,"‘Some had shoes, but all had rifles, Them that wasn’t bald was beardless, And the drum was rolling _Dixie_, And they stepped to it like men, sir! "
109,ROMANCE,"‘Rags and tatters, belts and bayonets, On they swung, the drum a-rolling, Mum and sour.  It looked like fighting, And they meant it too, by thunder!’ "
110,PASTORAL,XXII PASTORAL 
111,PASTORAL,"IT’S the Spring. Earth has conceived, and her bosom, Teeming with summer, is glad. "
112,PASTORAL,"Vistas of change and adventure, Thro’ the green land The grey roads go beckoning and winding, Peopled with wains, and melodious With harness-bells jangling: Jangling and twangling rough rhythms To the slow march of the stately, great horses Whistled and shouted along. "
113,PASTORAL,"White fleets of cloud, Argosies heavy with fruitfulness, Sail the blue peacefully.  Green flame the hedgerows. Blackbirds are bugling, and white in wet winds Sway the tall poplars. Pageants of colour and fragrance, Pass the sweet meadows, and viewless Walks the mild spirit of May, Visibly blessing the world. "
114,PASTORAL,"O, the brilliance of blossoming orchards! O, the savour and thrill of the woods, When their leafage is stirred By the flight of the Angel of Rain! Loud lows the steer; in the fallows Rooks are alert; and the brooks Gurgle and tinkle and trill.  Thro’ the gloamings, Under the rare, shy stars, Boy and girl wander, Dreaming in darkness and dew. "
115,PASTORAL,"It’s the Spring. A sprightliness feeble and squalid Wakes in the ward, and I sicken, Impotent, winter at heart. "
116,MUSIC,XXIII MUSIC 
117,MUSIC,"DOWN the quiet eve, Thro’ my window with the sunset Pipes to me a distant organ Foolish ditties; "
118,MUSIC,"And, as when you change Pictures in a magic lantern, Books, beds, bottles, floor, and ceiling Fade and vanish, "
119,MUSIC,"And I’m well once more . . . August flares adust and torrid, But my heart is full of April Sap and sweetness. "
120,MUSIC,"In the quiet eve I am loitering, longing, dreaming . . . Dreaming, and a distant organ Pipes me ditties. "
121,MUSIC,"I can see the shop, I can smell the sprinkled pavement, Where she serves—her chestnut chignon Thrills my senses! "
122,MUSIC,"O, the sight and scent, Wistful eve and perfumed pavement! In the distance pipes an organ . . . The sensation "
123,MUSIC,"Comes to me anew, And my spirit for a moment Thro’ the music breathes the blessèd Airs of London. "
124,SUICIDE,XXIV SUICIDE 
125,SUICIDE,"STARING corpselike at the ceiling, See his harsh, unrazored features, Ghastly brown against the pillow, And his throat—so strangely bandaged! "
126,SUICIDE,"Lack of work and lack of victuals, A debauch of smuggled whisky, And his children in the workhouse Made the world so black a riddle "
127,SUICIDE,"That he plunged for a solution; And, although his knife was edgeless, He was sinking fast towards one, When they came, and found, and saved him. "
128,SUICIDE,"Stupid now with shame and sorrow, In the night I hear him sobbing. But sometimes he talks a little. He has told me all his troubles. "
129,SUICIDE,"In his broad face, tanned and bloodless, White and wild his eyeballs glisten; And his smile, occult and tragic, Yet so slavish, makes you shudder! "
130,APPARITION,XXV APPARITION 
131,APPARITION,"THIN-LEGGED, thin-chested, slight unspeakably, Neat-footed and weak-fingered: in his face— Lean, large-boned, curved of beak, and touched with race, Bold-lipped, rich-tinted, mutable as the sea, The brown eyes radiant with vivacity— There shines a brilliant and romantic grace, A spirit intense and rare, with trace on trace Of passion and impudence and energy. Valiant in velvet, light in ragged luck, Most vain, most generous, sternly critical, Buffoon and poet, lover and sensualist: A deal of Ariel, just a streak of Puck, Much Antony, of Hamlet most of all, And something of the Shorter-Catechist. "
132,ANTEROTICS,XXVI ANTEROTICS 
133,ANTEROTICS,"LAUGHS the happy April morn Thro’ my grimy, little window, And a shaft of sunshine pushes Thro’ the shadows in the square. "
134,ANTEROTICS,"Dogs are tracing thro’ the grass, Crows are cawing round the chimneys, In and out among the washing Goes the West at hide-and-seek. "
135,ANTEROTICS,"Loud and cheerful clangs the bell. Here the nurses troop to breakfast. Handsome, ugly, all are women . . . O, the Spring—the Spring—the Spring! "
136,NOCTURN,XXVII NOCTURN 
137,NOCTURN,"AT the barren heart of midnight, When the shadow shuts and opens As the loud flames pulse and flutter, I can hear a cistern leaking. "
138,NOCTURN,"Dripping, dropping, in a rhythm, Rough, unequal, half-melodious, Like the measures aped from nature In the infancy of music; "
139,NOCTURN,"Like the buzzing of an insect, Still, irrational, persistent . . . I must listen, listen, listen In a passion of attention; "
140,NOCTURN,"Till it taps upon my heartstrings, And my very life goes dripping, Dropping, dripping, drip-drip-dropping, In the drip-drop of the cistern. "
141,DISCHARGED,XXVIII DISCHARGED 
142,DISCHARGED,"CARRY me out Into the wind and the sunshine, Into the beautiful world. "
143,DISCHARGED,"O, the wonder, the spell of the streets! The stature and strength of the horses, The rustle and echo of footfalls, The flat roar and rattle of wheels! A swift tram floats huge on us . . . It’s a dream? The smell of the mud in my nostrils Blows brave—like a breath of the sea! "
144,DISCHARGED,"As of old, Ambulant, undulant drapery, Vaguery and strangely provocative, Fluttersd and beckons.  O, yonder— Is it?—the gleam of a stocking! Sudden, a spire Wedged in the mist!  O, the houses, The long lines of lofty, grey houses, Cross-hatched with shadow and light! These are the streets . . . Each is an avenue leading Whither I will! "
145,DISCHARGED,"Free . . . ! Dizzy, hysterical, faint, I sit, and the carriage rolls on with me Into the wonderful world. "

148,ENVOY,"DO you remember That afternoon—that Sunday afternoon!— When, as the kirks were ringing in, And the grey city teemed With Sabbath feelings and aspects, LEWIS—our LEWIS then, Now the whole world’s—and you, Young, yet in shape most like an elder, came, Laden with BALZACS (Big, yellow books, quite impudently French), The first of many times To that transformed back-kitchen where I lay So long, so many centuries— Or years is it!—ago? "
149,ENVOY,"Dear CHARLES, since then We have been friends, LEWIS and you and I, (How good it sounds, ‘LEWIS and you and I!’): Such friends, I like to think, That in us three, LEWIS and me and you, Is something of that gallant dream Which old DUMAS—the generous, the humane, The seven-and-seventy times to be forgiven!— Dreamed for a blessing to the race, The immortal _Musketeers_. "
150,ENVOY,"Our ATHOS rests—the wise, the kind, The liberal and august, his fault atoned, Rests in the crowded yard There at the west of Princes Street.  We three— You, I, and LEWIS!—still afoot, Are still together, and our lives, In chime so long, may keep (God bless the thought!) Unjangled till the end. "

153,OF THE SWORD,THE SONG OF THE SWORD 
154,OF THE SWORD,(_To_ Rudyard Kipling) 
155,OF THE SWORD,1890 
156,OF THE SWORD,_The Sword_ _Singing_— _The voice of the Sword from the heart of the Sword_ _Clanging imperious_ _Forth from Time’s battlements_ _His ancient and triumphing Song_. 
157,OF THE SWORD,"In the beginning, Ere God inspired Himself Into the clay thing Thumbed to His image, The vacant, the naked shell Soon to be Man: Thoughtful He pondered it, Prone there and impotent, Fragile, inviting Attack and discomfiture; Then, with a smile— As He heard in the Thunder That laughed over Eden The voice of the Trumpet, The iron Beneficence, Calling his dooms To the Winds of the world— Stooping, He drew On the sand with His finger A shape for a sign Of his way to the eyes That in wonder should waken, For a proof of His will To the breaking intelligence. That was the birth of me: I am the Sword. "
158,OF THE SWORD,"Bleak and lean, grey and cruel, Short-hilted, long shafted, I froze into steel; And the blood of my elder, His hand on the hafts of me, Sprang like a wave In the wind, as the sense Of his strength grew to ecstasy; Glowed like a coal In the throat of the furnace; As he knew me and named me The War-Thing, the Comrade, Father of honour And giver of kingship, The fame-smith, the song-master, Bringer of women On fire at his hands For the pride of fulfilment, _Priest_ (saith the Lord) _Of his marriage with victory_ Ho! then, the Trumpet, Handmaid of heroes, Calling the peers To the place of espousals! Ho! then, the splendour And glare of my ministry, Clothing the earth With a livery of lightnings! Ho! then, the music Of battles in onset, And ruining armours, And God’s gift returning In fury to God! Thrilling and keen As the song of the winter stars, Ho! then, the sound Of my voice, the implacable Angel of Destiny!— I am the Sword. "
159,OF THE SWORD,"Heroes, my children, Follow, O, follow me! Follow, exulting In the great light that breaks From the sacred Companionship! Thrust through the fatuous, Thrust through the fungous brood, Spawned in my shadow And gross with my gift! Thrust through, and hearken O, hark, to the Trumpet, The Virgin of Battles, Calling, still calling you Into the Presence, Sons of the Judgment, Pure wafts of the Will! Edged to annihilate, Hilted with government, Follow, O, follow me, Till the waste places All the grey globe over Ooze, as the honeycomb Drips, with the sweetness Distilled of my strength, And, teeming in peace Through the wrath of my coming, They give back in beauty The dread and the anguish They had of me visitant! Follow, O follow, then, Heroes, my harvesters! Where the tall grain is ripe Thrust in your sickles! Stripped and adust In a stubble of empire, Scything and binding The full sheaves of sovranty: Thus, O, thus gloriously, Shall you fulfil yourselves! Thus, O, thus mightily, Show yourselves sons of mine— Yea, and win grace of me: I am the Sword! "
160,OF THE SWORD,"I am the feast-maker: Hark, through a noise Of the screaming of eagles, Hark how the Trumpet, The mistress of mistresses, Calls, silver-throated And stern, where the tables Are spread, and the meal Of the Lord is in hand! Driving the darkness, Even as the banners And spears of the Morning; Sifting the nations, The slag from the metal, The waste and the weak From the fit and the strong; Fighting the brute, The abysmal Fecundity; Checking the gross, Multitudinous blunders, The groping, the purblind Excesses in service Of the Womb universal, The absolute drudge; Firing the charactry Carved on the World, The miraculous gem In the seal-ring that burns On the hand of the Master— Yea! and authority Flames through the dim, Unappeasable Grisliness Prone down the nethermost Chasms of the Void!— Clear singing, clean slicing; Sweet spoken, soft finishing; Making death beautiful, Life but a coin To be staked in the pastime Whose playing is more Than the transfer of being; Arch-anarch, chief builder, Prince and evangelist, I am the Will of God: I am the Sword. "
161,OF THE SWORD,"_The Sword_ _Singing_— _The voice of the Sword from the heart of the Sword_ _Clanging majestical_, _As from the starry-staired_ _Courts of the primal Supremacy_, _His high_, _irresistible song_. "

164,ENTERTAINMENTS,1893 
165,ENTERTAINMENTS,‘O mes chères _Mille et Une Nuits_!’—_Fantasio_. 
166,ENTERTAINMENTS,"ONCE on a time There was a little boy: a master-mage By virtue of a Book Of magic—O, so magical it filled His life with visionary pomps Processional!  And Powers Passed with him where he passed.  And Thrones And Dominations, glaived and plumed and mailed, Thronged in the criss-cross streets, The palaces pell-mell with playing-fields, Domes, cloisters, dungeons, caverns, tents, arcades, Of the unseen, silent City, in his soul Pavilioned jealously, and hid As in the dusk, profound, Green stillnesses of some enchanted mere.— "
167,ENTERTAINMENTS,"I shut mine eyes . . . And lo! A flickering snatch of memory that floats Upon the face of a pool of darkness five And thirty dead years deep, Antic in girlish broideries And skirts and silly shoes with straps And a broad-ribanded leghorn, he walks Plain in the shadow of a church (St. Michael’s: in whose brazen call To curfew his first wails of wrath were whelmed), Sedate for all his haste To be at home; and, nestled in his arm, Inciting still to quiet and solitude, Boarded in sober drab, With small, square, agitating cuts Let in a-top of the double-columned, close, Quakerlike print, a Book! . . . What but that blessed brief Of what is gallantest and best In all the full-shelved Libraries of Romance? The Book of rocs, Sandalwood, ivory, turbans, ambergris, Cream-tarts, and lettered apes, and calendars, And ghouls, and genies—O, so huge They might have overed the tall Minster Tower Hands down, as schoolboys take a post! In truth, the Book of Camaralzaman, Schemselnihar and Sindbad, Scheherezade The peerless, Bedreddin, Badroulbadour, Cairo and Serendib and Candahar, And Caspian, and the dim, terrific bulk— Ice-ribbed, fiend-visited, isled in spells and storms— Of Kaf! . . . That centre of miracles, The sole, unparalleled Arabian Nights! "
168,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Old friends I had a-many—kindly and grim Familiars, cronies quaint And goblin!  Never a Wood but housed Some morrice of dainty dapperlings.  No Brook But had his nunnery Of green-haired, silvry-curving sprites, To cabin in his grots, and pace His lilied margents.  Every lone Hillside Might open upon Elf-Land.  Every Stalk That curled about a Bean-stick was of the breed Of that live ladder by whose delicate rungs You climbed beyond the clouds, and found The Farm-House where the Ogre, gorged And drowsy, from his great oak chair, Among the flitches and pewters at the fire, Called for his Faëry Harp.  And in it flew, And, perching on the kitchen table, sang Jocund and jubilant, with a sound Of those gay, golden-vowered madrigals The shy thrush at mid-May Flutes from wet orchards flushed with the triumphing dawn; Or blackbirds rioting as they listened still, In old-world woodlands rapt with an old-world spring, For Pan’s own whistle, savage and rich and lewd, And mocked him call for call! "
169,ENTERTAINMENTS,"I could not pass The half-door where the cobbler sat in view Nor figure me the wizen Leprechaun, In square-cut, faded reds and buckle-shoes, Bent at his work in the hedge-side, and know Just how he tapped his brogue, and twitched His wax-end this and that way, both with wrists And elbows.  In the rich June fields, Where the ripe clover drew the bees, And the tall quakers trembled, and the West Wind Lolled his half-holiday away Beside me lolling and lounging through my own, ’Twas good to follow the Miller’s Youngest Son On his white horse along the leafy lanes; For at his stirrup linked and ran, Not cynical and trapesing, as he loped From wall to wall above the espaliers, But in the bravest tops That market-town, a town of tops, could show: Bold, subtle, adventurous, his tail A banner flaunted in disdain Of human stratagems and shifts: King over All the Catlands, present and past And future, that moustached Artificer of fortunes, Puss-in-Boots! Or Bluebeard’s Closet, with its plenishing Of meat-hooks, sawdust, blood, And wives that hung like fresh-dressed carcases— Odd-fangled, most a butcher’s, part A faëry chamber hazily seen And hazily figured—on dark afternoons And windy nights was visiting of the best. Then, too, the pelt of hoofs Out in the roaring darkness told Of Herne the Hunter in his antlered helm Galloping, as with despatches from the Pit, Between his hell-born Hounds. And Rip Van Winkle . . . often I lurked to hear, Outside the long, low timbered, tarry wall, The mutter and rumble of the trolling bowls Down the lean plank, before they fluttered the pins; For, listening, I could help him play His wonderful game, In those blue, booming hills, with Mariners Refreshed from kegs not coopered in this our world. "
170,ENTERTAINMENTS,"But what were these so near, So neighbourly fancies to the spell that brought The run of Ali Baba’s Cave Just for the saying ‘Open Sesame,’ With gold to measure, peck by peck, In round, brown wooden stoups You borrowed at the chandler’s? . . . Or one time Made you Aladdin’s friend at school, Free of his Garden of Jewels, Ring and Lamp In perfect trim? . . . Or Ladies, fair For all the embrowning scars in their white breasts Went labouring under some dread ordinance, Which made them whip, and bitterly cry the while, Strange Curs that cried as they, Till there was never a Black Bitch of all Your consorting but might have gone Spell-driven miserably for crimes Done in the pride of womanhood and desire . . . Or at the ghostliest altitudes of night, While you lay wondering and acold, Your sense was fearfully purged; and soon Queen Labé, abominable and dear, Rose from your side, opened the Box of Doom, Scattered the yellow powder (which I saw Like sulphur at the Docks in bulk), And muttered certain words you could not hear; And there! a living stream, The brook you bathed in, with its weeds and flags And cresses, glittered and sang Out of the hearthrug over the nakedness, Fair-scrubbed and decent, of your bedroom floor! . . . "
171,ENTERTAINMENTS,"I was—how many a time!— That Second Calendar, Son of a King, On whom ’twas vehemently enjoined, Pausing at one mysterious door, To pry no closer, but content his soul With his kind Forty.  Yet I could not rest For idleness and ungovernable Fate. And the Black Horse, which fed on sesame (That wonder-working word!), Vouchsafed his back to me, and spread his vans, And soaring, soaring on From air to air, came charging to the ground Sheer, like a lark from the midsummer clouds, And, shaking me out of the saddle, where I sprawled Flicked at me with his tail, And left me blinded, miserable, distraught (Even as I was in deed, When doctors came, and odious things were done On my poor tortured eyes With lancets; or some evil acid stung And wrung them like hot sand, And desperately from room to room Fumble I must my dark, disconsolate way), To get to Bagdad how I might.  But there I met with Merry Ladies.  O you three— Safie, Amine, Zobëidé—when my heart Forgets you all shall be forgot! And so we supped, we and the rest, On wine and roasted lamb, rose-water, dates, Almonds, pistachios, citrons.  And Haroun Laughed out of his lordly beard On Giaffar and Mesrour (_I_ knew the Three For all their Mossoul habits).  And outside The Tigris, flowing swift Like Severn bend for bend, twinkled and gleamed With broken and wavering shapes of stranger stars; The vast, blue night Was murmurous with peris’ plumes And the leathern wings of genies; words of power Were whispering; and old fishermen, Casting their nets with prayer, might draw to shore Dead loveliness: or a prodigy in scales Worth in the Caliph’s Kitchen pieces of gold: Or copper vessels, stopped with lead, Wherein some Squire of Eblis watched and railed, In durance under potent charactry Graven by the seal of Solomon the King . . . "
172,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Then, as the Book was glassed In Life as in some olden mirror’s quaint, Bewildering angles, so would Life Flash light on light back on the Book; and both Were changed.  Once in a house decayed From better days, harbouring an errant show (For all its stories of dry-rot Were filled with gruesome visitants in wax, Inhuman, hushed, ghastly with Painted Eyes), I wandered; and no living soul Was nearer than the pay-box; and I stared Upon them staring—staring.  Till at last, Three sets of rafters from the streets, I strayed upon a mildewed, rat-run room, With the two Dancers, horrible and obscene, Guarding the door: and there, in a bedroom-set, Behind a fence of faded crimson cords, With an aspect of frills And dimities and dishonoured privacy That made you hanker and hesitate to look, A Woman with her litter of Babes—all slain, All in their nightgowns, all with Painted Eyes Staring—still staring; so that I turned and ran As for my neck, but in the street Took breath.  The same, it seemed, And yet not all the same, I was to find, As I went up!  For afterwards, Whenas I went my round alone— All day alone—in long, stern, silent streets, Where I might stretch my hand and take Whatever I would: still there were Shapes of Stone, Motionless, lifelike, frightening—for the Wrath Had smitten them; but they watched, This by her melons and figs, that by his rings And chains and watches, with the hideous gaze, The Painted Eyes insufferable, Now, of those grisly images; and I Pursued my best-belovéd quest, Thrilled with a novel and delicious fear. So the night fell—with never a lamplighter; And through the Palace of the King I groped among the echoes, and I felt That they were there, Dreadfully there, the Painted staring Eyes, Hall after hall . . . Till lo! from far A Voice!  And in a little while Two tapers burning!  And the Voice, Heard in the wondrous Word of God, was—whose? Whose but Zobëidé’s, The lady of my heart, like me A True Believer, and like me An outcast thousands of leagues beyond the pale! . . . "
173,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Or, sailing to the Isles Of Khaledan, I spied one evenfall A black blotch in the sunset; and it grew Swiftly . . . and grew.  Tearing their beards, The sailors wept and prayed; but the grave ship, Deep laden with spiceries and pearls, went mad, Wrenched the long tiller out of the steersman’s hand, And, turning broadside on, As the most iron would, was haled and sucked Nearer, and nearer yet; And, all awash, with horrible lurching leaps Rushed at that Portent, casting a shadow now That swallowed sea and sky; and then, Anchors and nails and bolts Flew screaming out of her, and with clang on clang, A noise of fifty stithies, caught at the sides Of the Magnetic Mountain; and she lay, A broken bundle of firewood, strown piecemeal About the waters; and her crew Passed shrieking, one by one; and I was left To drown.  All the long night I swam; But in the morning, O, the smiling coast Tufted with date-trees, meadowlike, Skirted with shelving sands!  And a great wave Cast me ashore; and I was saved alive. So, giving thanks to God, I dried my clothes, And, faring inland, in a desert place I stumbled on an iron ring— The fellow of fifty built into the Quays: When, scenting a trap-door, I dug, and dug; until my biggest blade Stuck into wood.  And then, The flight of smooth-hewn, easy-falling stairs, Sunk in the naked rock!  The cool, clean vault, So neat with niche on niche it might have been Our beer-cellar but for the rows Of brazen urns (like monstrous chemist’s jars) Full to the wide, squat throats With gold-dust, but a-top A layer of pickled-walnut-looking things I knew for olives!  And far, O, far away, The Princess of China languished!  Far away Was marriage, with a Vizier and a Chief Of Eunuchs and the privilege Of going out at night To play—unkenned, majestical, secure— Where the old, brown, friendly river shaped Like Tigris shore for shore!  Haply a Ghoul Sat in the churchyard under a frightened moon, A thighbone in his fist, and glared At supper with a Lady: she who took Her rice with tweezers grain by grain. Or you might stumble—there by the iron gates Of the Pump Room—underneath the limes— Upon Bedreddin in his shirt and drawers, Just as the civil Genie laid him down. Or those red-curtained panes, Whence a tame cornet tenored it throatily Of beer-pots and spittoons and new long pipes, Might turn a caravansery’s, wherein You found Noureddin Ali, loftily drunk, And that fair Persian, bathed in tears, You’d not have given away For all the diamonds in the Vale Perilous You had that dark and disleaved afternoon Escaped on a roc’s claw, Disguised like Sindbad—but in Christmas beef! And all the blissful while The schoolboy satchel at your hip Was such a bulse of gems as should amaze Grey-whiskered chapmen drawn From over Caspian: yea, the Chief Jewellers Of Tartary and the bazaars, Seething with traffic, of enormous Ind.— "
174,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Thus cried, thus called aloud, to the child heart The magian East: thus the child eyes Spelled out the wizard message by the light Of the sober, workaday hours They saw, week in week out, pass, and still pass In the sleepy Minster City, folded kind In ancient Severn’s arm, Amongst her water-meadows and her docks, Whose floating populace of ships— Galliots and luggers, light-heeled brigantines, Bluff barques and rake-hell fore-and-afters—brought To her very doorsteps and geraniums The scents of the World’s End; the calls That may not be gainsaid to rise and ride Like fire on some high errand of the race; The irresistible appeals For comradeship that sound Steadily from the irresistible sea. Thus the East laughed and whispered, and the tale, Telling itself anew In terms of living, labouring life, Took on the colours, busked it in the wear Of life that lived and laboured; and Romance, The Angel-Playmate, raining down His golden influences On all I saw, and all I dreamed and did, Walked with me arm in arm, Or left me, as one bediademed with straws And bits of glass, to gladden at my heart Who had the gift to seek and feel and find His fiery-hearted presence everywhere. Even so dear Hesper, bringer of all good things, Sends the same silver dews Of happiness down her dim, delighted skies On some poor collier-hamlet—(mound on mound Of sifted squalor; here a soot-throated stalk Sullenly smoking over a row Of flat-faced hovels; black in the gritty air A web of rails and wheels and beams; with strings Of hurtling, tipping trams)— As on the amorous nightingales And roses of Shíraz, or the walls and towers Of Samarcand—the Ineffable—whence you espy The splendour of Ginnistan’s embattled spears, Like listed lightnings. Samarcand! That name of names!  That star-vaned belvedere Builded against the Chambers of the South! That outpost on the Infinite! And behold! Questing therefrom, you knew not what wild tide Might overtake you: for one fringe, One suburb, is stablished on firm earth; but one Floats founded vague In lubberlands delectable—isles of palm And lotus, fortunate mains, far-shimmering seas, The promise of wistful hills— The shining, shifting Sovranties of Dream.

187,I. M.,"SPRING at her height on a morn at prime, Sails that laugh from a flying squall, Pomp of harmony, rapture of rhyme— Youth is the sign of them, one and all. Winter sunsets and leaves that fall, An empty flagon, a folded page, A tumble-down wheel, a tattered ball— These are a type of the world of Age. "
188,I. M.,"Bells that clash in a gaudy chime, Swords that clatter in onsets tall, The words that ring and the fames that climb— Youth is the sign of them, one and all. Hymnals old in a dusty stall, A bald, blind bird in a crazy cage, The scene of a faded festival— These are a type of the world of Age. "
189,I. M.,"Hours that strut as the heirs of time, Deeds whose rumour’s a clarion-call, Songs where the singers their souls sublime— Youth is the sign of them, one and all. A staff that rests in a nook of wall, A reeling battle, a rusted gage, The chant of a nearing funeral— These are a type of the world of Age. "

230,OF THE NOTHINGNESS OF THINGS,"The Fates are subtile girls! They give us chaff for grain. And Time, the Thunderer, hurls, Like bolted death, disdain At all that heart and brain Conceive, or great or small, Upon this earthly ball. Would you be knight and dame? Or woo the sweet humanities? Or illustrate a name? O Vanity of Vanities! "
231,OF THE NOTHINGNESS OF THINGS,"We sound the sea for pearls, Or drown them in a drain; We flute it with the merles, Or tug and sweat and strain; We grovel, or we reign; We saunter, or we brawl; We answer, or we call; We search the stars for Fame, Or sink her subterranities; The legend’s still the same:— ‘O Vanity of Vanities!’ "

Sudden the Forth came on us—sad of mien, No cloud to colour it, no breeze to line: A sheet of dark, dull glass, without a sign Of life or death, two spits of sand between. Water and sky merged blank in mist together, The Fort loomed spectral, and the Guardship’s spars Traced vague, black shadows on the shimmery glaze: We felt the dim, strange years, the grey, strange weather, The still, strange land, unvexed of sun or stars, Where Lancelot rides clanking thro’ the haze.

And when she passes with the dreadful boys And romping girls, the cockneys loud and crude, My thought, to the Minories tied yet moved to range The Land o’ the Sun, commingles with the noise Of magian drums and scents of sandalwood A touch Sidonian—modern—taking—strange!

A wide blue cloak, a squat and sturdy throng Of curt blue coats, a mutch without a speck, A white vest broidered black, her person deck, Nor seems their picked, stern, old-world quaintness wrong. Her great creel forehead-slung, she wanders nigh, Easing the heavy strap with gnarled, brown fingers, The spirit of traffic watchful in her eye, Ever and anon imploring you to buy, As looking down the street she onward lingers, Reproachful, with a strange and doleful cry.

Your tawny hair, turned strand on strand And bound with blue ribands together, Streaked the rough tartan, green like heather, That round your lissome shoulder spanned. Your grace was quick my sense to seize: The quaint looped hat, the twisted tresses, The close-drawn scarf, and under these The flowing, flapping draperies— My thought an outline still caresses, Enchanting, comic, Japanese!

249,CROLUIS,"THE beach was crowded.  Pausing now and then, He groped and fiddled doggedly along, His worn face glaring on the thoughtless throng The stony peevishness of sightless men. He seemed scarce older than his clothes.  Again, Grotesquing thinly many an old sweet song, So cracked his fiddle, his hand so frail and wrong, You hardly could distinguish one in ten. He stopped at last, and sat him on the sand, And, grasping wearily his bread-winner, Stared dim towards the blue immensity, Then leaned his head upon his poor old hand. He may have slept: he did not speak nor stir: His gesture spoke a vast despondency. "

252,ATTADALE WEST HIGHLANDS,"A BLACK and glassy float, opaque and still, The loch, at furthest ebb supine in sleep, Reversing, mirrored in its luminous deep The calm grey skies; the solemn spurs of hill; Heather, and corn, and wisps of loitering haze; The wee white cots, black-hatted, plumed with smoke; The braes beyond—and when the ripple awoke, They wavered with the jarred and wavering glaze. The air was hushed and dreamy.  Evermore A noise of running water whispered near. A straggling crow called high and thin.  A bird Trilled from the birch-leaves.  Round the shingled shore, Yellow with weed, there wandered, vague and clear, Strange vowels, mysterious gutturals, idly heard. "

255,FROM A WINDOW IN PRINCES STREET,"ABOVE the Crags that fade and gloom Starts the bare knee of Arthur’s Seat; Ridged high against the evening bloom, The Old Town rises, street on street; With lamps bejewelled, straight ahead, Like rampired walls the houses lean, All spired and domed and turreted, Sheer to the valley’s darkling green; Ranged in mysterious disarray, The Castle, menacing and austere, Looms through the lingering last of day; And in the silver dusk you hear, Reverberated from crag and scar, Bold bugles blowing points of war.

257,IN THE DIALS,"TO _Garryowen_ upon an organ ground Two girls are jigging.  Riotously they trip, With eyes aflame, quick bosoms, hand on hip, As in the tumult of a witches’ round. Youngsters and youngsters round them prance and bound. Two solemn babes twirl ponderously, and skip. The artist’s teeth gleam from his bearded lip. High from the kennel howls a tortured hound. The music reels and hurtles, and the night Is full of stinks and cries; a naphtha-light Flares from a barrow; battered and obtused With vices, wrinkles, life and work and rags, Each with her inch of clay, two loitering hags Look on dispassionate—critical—something ’mused.

261,THE GODS ARE DEAD,"It must be true.  The world, a world of prose, Full-crammed with facts, in science swathed and sheeted, Nods in a stertorous after-dinner doze! Plangent and sad, in every wind that blows Who will may hear the sorry words repeated:— ‘The Gods are Dead!’ "
262,THE GODS ARE DEAD,_To_ F. W. 
263,THE GODS ARE DEAD,"LET us be drunk, and for a while forget, Forget, and, ceasing even from regret, Live without reason and despite of rhyme, As in a dream preposterous and sublime, Where place and hour and means for once are met. "
264,THE GODS ARE DEAD,"Where is the use of effort?  Love and debt And disappointment have us in a net. Let us break out, and taste the morning prime . . . Let us be drunk. "
265,THE GODS ARE DEAD,"In vain our little hour we strut and fret, And mouth our wretched parts as for a bet: We cannot please the tragicaster Time. To gain the crystal sphere, the silver dime, Where Sympathy sits dimpling on us yet, Let us be drunk! "
266,WHEN YOU ARE OLD,WHEN YOU ARE OLD 
267,WHEN YOU ARE OLD,"WHEN you are old, and I am passed away— Passed, and your face, your golden face, is gray— I think, whate’er the end, this dream of mine, Comforting you, a friendly star will shine Down the dim slope where still you stumble and stray. "
268,WHEN YOU ARE OLD,"So may it be: that so dead Yesterday, No sad-eyed ghost but generous and gay, May serve you memories like almighty wine, When you are old! "
269,WHEN YOU ARE OLD,"Dear Heart, it shall be so.  Under the sway Of death the past’s enormous disarray Lies hushed and dark.  Yet though there come no sign, Live on well pleased: immortal and divine Love shall still tend you, as God’s angels may, When you are old. "
270,BESIDE THE IDLE SUMMER SEA,BESIDE THE IDLE SUMMER SEA 
271,BESIDE THE IDLE SUMMER SEA,"BESIDE the idle summer sea And in the vacant summer days, Light Love came fluting down the ways, Where you were loitering with me. "
272,BESIDE THE IDLE SUMMER SEA,"Who has not welcomed, even as we, That jocund minstrel and his lays Beside the idle summer sea And in the vacant summer days? "
273,BESIDE THE IDLE SUMMER SEA,"We listened, we were fancy-free; And lo! in terror and amaze We stood alone—alone at gaze With an implacable memory Beside the idle summer sea. "
274,R. G. C. B.,I. M. R. G. C. B. 1878 
275,R. G. C. B.,"THE ways of Death are soothing and serene, And all the words of Death are grave and sweet. From camp and church, the fireside and the street, She beckons forth—and strife and song have been. "
276,R. G. C. B.,"A summer night descending cool and green And dark on daytime’s dust and stress and heat, The ways of Death are soothing and serene, And all the words of Death are grave and sweet. "
277,R. G. C. B.,"O glad and sorrowful, with triumphant mien And radiant faces look upon, and greet This last of all your lovers, and to meet Her kiss, the Comforter’s, your spirit lean . . . The ways of Death are soothing and serene. "
278,WE SHALL SURELY DIE,WE SHALL SURELY DIE 
279,WE SHALL SURELY DIE,"WE shall surely die: Must we needs grow old? Grow old and cold, And we know not why? "
280,WE SHALL SURELY DIE,"O, the By-and-By, And the tale that’s told! We shall surely die: Must we needs grow old? "
281,WE SHALL SURELY DIE,"Grow old and sigh, Grudge and withhold, Resent and scold? . . . Not you and I? We shall surely die! "
282,WHAT IS TO COME,WHAT IS TO COME 
283,WHAT IS TO COME,"WHAT is to come we know not.  But we know That what has been was good—was good to show, Better to hide, and best of all to bear. We are the masters of the days that were: We have lived, we have loved, we have suffered . . . even so. "
284,WHAT IS TO COME,"Shall we not take the ebb who had the flow? Life was our friend.  Now, if it be our foe— Dear, though it spoil and break us!—need we care What is to come? "
285,WHAT IS TO COME,"Let the great winds their worst and wildest blow, Or the gold weather round us mellow slow: We have fulfilled ourselves, and we can dare And we can conquer, though we may not share In the rich quiet of the afterglow What is to come. "

290,TO MY MOTHER,I TO MY MOTHER 
291,TO MY MOTHER,"CHIMING a dream by the way With ocean’s rapture and roar, I met a maiden to-day Walking alone on the shore: Walking in maiden wise, Modest and kind and fair, The freshness of spring in her eyes And the fulness of spring in her hair. "
292,TO MY MOTHER,"Cloud-shadow and scudding sun-burst Were swift on the floor of the sea, And a mad wind was romping its worst, But what was their magic to me? Or the charm of the midsummer skies? I only saw she was there, A dream of the sea in her eyes And the kiss of the sea in her hair. "
293,TO MY MOTHER,"I watched her vanish in space; She came where I walked no more; But something had passed of her grace To the spell of the wave and the shore; And now, as the glad stars rise, She comes to me, rosy and rare, The delight of the wind in her eyes And the hand of the wind in her hair. "
294,TO MY MOTHER,1872 
295,II,II 
296,II,"LIFE is bitter.  All the faces of the years, Young and old, are grey with travail and with tears. Must we only wake to toil, to tire, to weep? In the sun, among the leaves, upon the flowers, Slumber stills to dreamy death the heavy hours . . . Let me sleep. "
297,II,"Riches won but mock the old, unable years; Fame’s a pearl that hides beneath a sea of tears; Love must wither, or must live alone and weep. In the sunshine, through the leaves, across the flowers, While we slumber, death approaches though the hours! . . . Let me sleep. "
298,II,1872 
299,III,III 
300,III,"O, GATHER me the rose, the rose, While yet in flower we find it, For summer smiles, but summer goes, And winter waits behind it! "
301,III,"For with the dream foregone, foregone, The deed forborne for ever, The worm, regret, will canker on, And Time will turn him never. "
302,III,"So well it were to love, my love, And cheat of any laughter The fate beneath us and above, The dark before and after. "
303,III,"The myrtle and the rose, the rose, The sunshine and the swallow, The dream that comes, the wish that goes, The memories that follow! "

306,R. T. HAMILTON BRUCE,"OUT of the night that covers me, Black as the Pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. "
307,R. T. HAMILTON BRUCE,"In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. "
308,R. T. HAMILTON BRUCE,"Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find, me unafraid. "
309,R. T. HAMILTON BRUCE,"It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul. "

311,V,V 
312,V,"I AM the Reaper. All things with heedful hook Silent I gather. Pale roses touched with the spring, Tall corn in summer, Fruits rich with autumn, and frail winter blossoms— Reaping, still reaping— All things with heedful hook Timely I gather. "
313,V,"I am the Sower. All the unbodied life Runs through my seed-sheet. Atom with atom wed, Each quickening the other, Fall through my hands, ever changing, still changeless Ceaselessly sowing, Life, incorruptible life, Flows from my seed-sheet. "
314,V,"Maker and breaker, I am the ebb and the flood, Here and Hereafter. Sped through the tangle and coil Of infinite nature, Viewless and soundless I fashion all being. Taker and giver, I am the womb and the grave, The Now and the Ever. "
315,V,1875 
316,VI,VI 
317,VI,"PRAISE the generous gods for giving In a world of wrath and strife With a little time for living, Unto all the joy of life. "
318,VI,"At whatever source we drink it, Art or love or faith or wine, In whatever terms we think it, It is common and divine. "
319,VI,"Praise the high gods, for in giving This to man, and this alone, They have made his chance of living Shine the equal of their own. "
320,VI,1875 
321,VII,VII 
322,VII,"FILL a glass with golden wine, And the while your lips are wet Set their perfume unto mine, And forget, Every kiss we take and give Leaves us less of life to live. "
323,VII,"Yet again! Your whim and mine In a happy while have met. All your sweets to me resign, Nor regret That we press with every breath, Sighed or singing, nearer death. "
324,VII,1875 
325,VIII,VIII 
326,VIII,"WE’LL go no more a-roving by the light of the moon. November glooms are barren beside the dusk of June. The summer flowers are faded, the summer thoughts are sere. We’ll go no more a-roving, lest worse befall, my dear. "
327,VIII,"We’ll go no more a-roving by the light of the moon. The song we sang rings hollow, and heavy runs the tune. Glad ways and words remembered would shame the wretched year. We’ll go no more a-roving, nor dream we did, my dear. "
328,VIII,"We’ll go no more a-roving by the light of the moon. If yet we walk together, we need not shun the noon. No sweet thing left to savour, no sad thing left to fear, We’ll go no more a-roving, but weep at home, my dear. "
329,VIII,1875 
330,IX,IX _To_ W. R. 
331,IX,"MADAM Life’s a piece in bloom Death goes dogging everywhere: She’s the tenant of the room, He’s the ruffian on the stair. "
332,IX,"You shall see her as a friend, You shall bilk him once and twice; But he’ll trap you in the end, And he’ll stick you for her price. "
333,IX,"With his kneebones at your chest, And his knuckles in your throat, You would reason—plead—protest! Clutching at her petticoat; "
334,IX,"But she’s heard it all before, Well she knows you’ve had your fun, Gingerly she gains the door, And your little job is done. "

341,XI,"THICK is the darkness— Sunward, O, sunward! Rough is the highway— Onward, still onward! "

345,XII,XII 
346,XII,TO me at my fifth-floor window The chimney-pots in rows Are sets of pipes pandean For every wind that blows; 
347,XII,And the smoke that whirls and eddies In a thousand times and keys Is really a visible music Set to my reveries. 
348,XII,"O monstrous pipes, melodious With fitful tune and dream, The clouds are your only audience, Her thought is your only theme! "
349,XII,1875 
350,XIII,XIII 
351,XIII,"BRING her again, O western wind, Over the western sea: Gentle and good and fair and kind, Bring her again to me! "
352,XIII,"Not that her fancy holds me dear, Not that a hope may be: Only that I may know her near, Wind of the western sea. "
353,XIII,1875 
354,XIV,XIV 
355,XIV,"THE wan sun westers, faint and slow; The eastern distance glimmers gray; An eerie haze comes creeping low Across the little, lonely bay; And from the sky-line far away About the quiet heaven are spread Mysterious hints of dying day, Thin, delicate dreams of green and red. "
356,XIV,"And weak, reluctant surges lap And rustle round and down the strand. No other sound . . . If it should hap, The ship that sails from fairy-land! The silken shrouds with spells are manned, The hull is magically scrolled, The squat mast lives, and in the sand The gold prow-griffin claws a hold. "
357,XIV,"It steals to seaward silently; Strange fish-folk follow thro’ the gloom; Great wings flap overhead; I see The Castle of the Drowsy Doom Vague thro’ the changeless twilight loom, Enchanted, hushed.  And ever there She slumbers in eternal bloom, Her cushions hid with golden hair. "
358,XIV,1875 
359,XV,XV 
360,XV,"THERE is a wheel inside my head Of wantonness and wine, An old, cracked fiddle is begging without, But the wind with scents of the sea is fed, And the sun seems glad to shine. "
361,XV,"The sun and the wind are akin to you, As you are akin to June. But the fiddle! . . . It giggles and twitters about, And, love and laughter! who gave him the cue?— He’s playing your favourite tune. "
362,XV,1875 
363,XVI,XVI 
364,XVI,WHILE the west is paling Starshine is begun. While the dusk is failing Glimmers up the sun.

368,XVII,XVII 
369,XVII,"THE sands are alive with sunshine, The bathers lounge and throng, And out in the bay a bugle Is lilting a gallant song. "
370,XVII,"The clouds go racing eastward, The blithe wind cannot rest, And a shard on the shingle flashes Like the shining soul of a jest; "
371,XVII,"While children romp in the surges, And sweethearts wander free, And the Firth as with laughter dimples . . . I would it were deep over me! "
372,XVII,1875 
373,XVIII,XVIII _To_ A. D. 
374,XVIII,"THE nightingale has a lyre of gold, The lark’s is a clarion-call, And the blackbird plays but a boxwood flute, But I love him best of all. "
375,XVIII,"For his song is all of the joy of life, And we in the mad, spring weather, We two have listened till he sang Our hearts and lips together. "
376,XVIII,1876 
377,XIX,XIX 
378,XIX,"YOUR heart has trembled to my tongue, Your hands in mine have lain, Your thought to me has leaned and clung, Again and yet again, My dear, Again and yet again. "

382,XX,"THE surges gushed and sounded, The blue was the blue of June, And low above the brightening east Floated a shred of moon. "

384,XX,1877 
385,XXI,XXI 
386,XXI,WE flash across the level. We thunder thro’ the bridges. We bicker down the cuttings. We sway along the ridges. 
387,XXI,"A rush of streaming hedges, Of jostling lights and shadows, Of hurtling, hurrying stations, Of racing woods and meadows. "
388,XXI,We charge the tunnels headlong— The blackness roars and shatters. We crash between embankments— The open spins and scatters. 
389,XXI,"We shake off the miles like water, We might carry a royal ransom; And I think of her waiting, waiting, And long for a common hansom. "
390,XXI,1876 
391,XXII,XXII 
392,XXII,"THE West a glimmering lake of light, A dream of pearly weather, The first of stars is burning white— The star we watch together. Is April dead?  The unresting year Will shape us our September, And April’s work is done, my dear— Do you not remember? "
393,XXII,"O gracious eve!  O happy star, Still-flashing, glowing, sinking!— Who lives of lovers near or far So glad as I in thinking? The gallant world is warm and green, For May fulfils November. When lights and leaves and loves have been, Sweet, will you remember? "
394,XXII,"O star benignant and serene, I take the good to-morrow, That fills from verge to verge my dream, With all its joy and sorrow! The old, sweet spell is unforgot That turns to June December; And, tho’ the world remembered not, Love, we would remember. "
395,XXII,1876 
396,XXIII,XXIII 
397,XXIII,"THE skies are strown with stars, The streets are fresh with dew A thin moon drifts to westward, The night is hushed and cheerful. My thought is quick with you. "

400,XXIV,XXIV 
401,XXIV,"THE full sea rolls and thunders In glory and in glee. O, bury me not in the senseless earth But in the living sea! "

404,XXV,XXV 
405,XXV,"IN the year that’s come and gone, love, his flying feather Stooping slowly, gave us heart, and bade us walk together. In the year that’s coming on, though many a troth be broken, We at least will not forget aught that love hath spoken. "
406,XXV,"In the year that’s come and gone, dear, we wove a tether All of gracious words and thoughts, binding two together. In the year that’s coming on with its wealth of roses We shall weave it stronger, yet, ere the circle closes. "
407,XXV,"In the year that’s come and gone, in the golden weather, Sweet, my sweet, we swore to keep the watch of life together. In the year that’s coming on, rich in joy and sorrow, We shall light our lamp, and wait life’s mysterious morrow. "

409,XXVI,XXVI 
410,XXVI,"IN the placid summer midnight, Under the drowsy sky, I seem to hear in the stillness The moths go glimmering by. "
411,XXVI,One by one from the windows The lights have all been sped. Never a blind looks conscious— The street is asleep in bed! 
412,XXVI,But I come where a living casement Laughs luminous and wide; I hear the song of a piano Break in a sparkling tide; 
413,XXVI,"And I feel, in the waltz that frolics And warbles swift and clear, A sudden sense of shelter And friendliness and cheer . . . "
414,XXVI,"A sense of tinkling glasses, Of love and laughter and light— The piano stops, and the window Stares blank out into the night. "
415,XXVI,"The blind goes out, and I wander To the old, unfriendly sea, The lonelier for the memory That walks like a ghost with me. "
416,XXVII,XXVII 
417,XXVII,"SHE sauntered by the swinging seas, A jewel glittered at her ear, And, teasing her along, the breeze Brought many a rounded grace more near. "
418,XXVII,"So passing, one with wave and beam, She left for memory to caress A laughing thought, a golden gleam, A hint of hidden loveliness. "
419,XXVII,1876 
420,XXVIII,XXVIII _To_ S. C. 
421,XXVIII,"BLITHE dreams arise to greet us, And life feels clean and new, For the old love comes to meet us In the dawning and the dew. O’erblown with sunny shadows, O’ersped with winds at play, The woodlands and the meadows Are keeping holiday. Wild foals are scampering, neighing, Brave merles their hautboys blow: Come! let us go a-maying As in the Long-Ago. "
422,XXVIII,"Here we but peak and dwindle: The clank of chain and crane, The whir of crank and spindle Bewilder heart and brain; The ends of our endeavour Are merely wealth and fame, Yet in the still Forever We’re one and all the same; Delaying, still delaying, We watch the fading west: Come! let us go a-maying, Nor fear to take the best. "
423,XXVIII,"Yet beautiful and spacious The wise, old world appears. Yet frank and fair and gracious Outlaugh the jocund years. Our arguments disputing, The universal Pan Still wanders fluting—fluting— Fluting to maid and man. Our weary well-a-waying His music cannot still: Come! let us go a-maying, And pipe with him our fill. "
424,XXVIII,"When wanton winds are flowing Among the gladdening glass; Where hawthorn brakes are blowing, And meadow perfumes pass; Where morning’s grace is greenest, And fullest noon’s of pride; Where sunset spreads serenest, And sacred night’s most wide; Where nests are swaying, swaying, And spring’s fresh voices call, Come! let us go a-maying, And bless the God of all!

For it’s home, dearie, home—it’s home I want to be. Our topsails are hoisted, and we’ll away to sea. O, the oak and the ash and the bonnie birken tree They’re all growing green in the old countrie. "
442,XXXII,"In Baltimore a-walking a lady I did meet With her babe on her arm, as she came down the street; And I thought how I sailed, and the cradle standing ready For the pretty little babe that has never seen its daddie. And it’s home, dearie, home . . . "
443,XXXII,"O, if it be a lass, she shall wear a golden ring; And if it be a lad, he shall fight for his king: With his dirk and his hat and his little jacket blue He shall walk the quarter-deck as his daddie used to do. And it’s home, dearie, home . . . "
444,XXXII,"O, there’s a wind a-blowing, a-blowing from the west, And that of all the winds is the one I like the best, For it blows at our backs, and it shakes our pennon free, And it soon will blow us home to the old countrie. For it’s home, dearie, home—it’s home I want to be. Our topsails are hoisted, and we’ll away to sea. O, the oak and the ash and the bonnie birken tree They’re all growing green in the old countrie. "

The spirit of spring is in every thing, The banners of spring are streaming, We march to a tune from the fifes of June, And life’s a dream worth dreaming. "
449,XXXIII,"It’s all very well to sit and spell At the lesson there’s no gainsaying; But what the deuce are wont and use When the whole mad world’s a-maying? When the meadow glows, and the orchard snows, And the air’s with love-motes teeming, When fancies break, and the senses wake, O, life’s a dream worth dreaming! "
450,XXXIII,"What Nature has writ with her lusty wit Is worded so wisely and kindly That whoever has dipped in her manuscript Must up and follow her blindly. Now the summer prime is her blithest rhyme In the being and the seeming, And they that have heard the overword Know life’s a dream worth dreaming. "

454,XXXIV,"LIFE in her creaking shoes Goes, and more formal grows, A round of calls and cues: Love blows as the wind blows. Blows! . . . in the quiet close As in the roaring mart, By ways no mortal knows Love blows into the heart. "
455,XXXIV,"The stars some cadence use, Forthright the river flows, In order fall the dews, Love blows as the wind blows: Blows! . . . and what reckoning shows The courses of his chart? A spirit that comes and goes, Love blows into the heart. "

458,MARGARITÆ SORORI,"A LATE lark twitters from the quiet skies; And from the west, Where the sun, his day’s work ended, Lingers as in content, There falls on the old, grey city An influence luminous and serene, A shining peace. "
459,MARGARITÆ SORORI,"The smoke ascends In a rosy-and-golden haze.  The spires Shine, and are changed.  In the valley Shadows rise.  The lark sings on.  The sun, Closing his benediction, Sinks, and the darkening air Thrills with a sense of the triumphing night— Night with her train of stars And her great gift of sleep. "

466,XXXVII,XXXVII _To_ W. A.

468,XXXVII,"I saw, I took, I cast you by, I bent and broke your pride. You loved me well, or I heard them lie, But your longing was denied. Surely I knew that by and by You cursed your gods and died. "
469,XXXVII,And a myriad suns have set and shone Since then upon the grave Decreed by the King in Babylon To her that had been his Slave. 
470,XXXVII,"The pride I trampled is now my scathe, For it tramples me again. The old resentment lasts like death, For you love, yet you refrain. I break my heart on your hard unfaith, And I break my heart in vain. "

474,XXXVIII,"By the river old and gray, The enchanted Long Ago Murmured and smiled anew. On the way to Kew, March had the laugh of May, The bare boughs looked aglow, And old, immortal words Sang in my breast like birds, Coming up from Richmond As I used with you. "
475,XXXVIII,"With the life of Long Ago Lived my thought of you. By the river old and gray Flowing his appointed way As I watched I knew What is so good to know— Not in vain, not in vain, Shall I look for you again Coming up from Richmond On the way to Kew. "

479,XXXIX,"Coming back like a ghost, staring and lingering on, Never a word it speaks but proves it dead and gone. "
480,XXXIX,"Duty and work and joy—these things it cannot give; And the Present is life, and life is good to live. "

498,XLII,"Friends . . . old friends . . . So it breaks, so it ends. There let it rest! It has fought and won, And is still the best That either has done. Each as he stands The work of its hands, Which shall be more As he was before? . . . What is it ends With friends? "

504,XLV,"Wise the enamoured Nightingale, Wise the well-belovèd Rose! Love and life shall still prevail, Nor the silence at the close Break the magic of the tale In the telling, though it shows— Who but knows How it goes!— Life a last year’s Nightingale, Love a last year’s Rose. "
505,I. M.,XLVI MATRI DILECTISSIMÆ I. M. 
506,I. M.,"IN the waste hour Between to-day and yesterday We watched, while on my arm— Living flesh of her flesh, bone of her bone— Dabbled in sweat the sacred head Lay uncomplaining, still, contemptuous, strange: Till the dear face turned dead, And to a sound of lamentation The good, heroic soul with all its wealth— Its sixty years of love and sacrifice, Suffering and passionate faith—was reabsorbed In the inexorable Peace, And life was changed to us for evermore. "
507,I. M.,"Was nothing left of her but tears Like blood-drops from the heart? Nought save remorse For duty unfulfilled, justice undone, And charity ignored?  Nothing but love, Forgiveness, reconcilement, where in truth, But for this passing Into the unimaginable abyss These things had never been? "
508,I. M.,"Nay, there were we, Her five strong sons! To her Death came—the great Deliverer came!— As equal comes to equal, throne to throne. She was a mother of men. "
509,I. M.,"The stars shine as of old.  The unchanging River, Bent on his errand of immortal law, Works his appointed way To the immemorial sea. And the brave truth comes overwhelmingly home:— That she in us yet works and shines, Lives and fulfils herself, Unending as the river and the stars. "
510,I. M.,"Dearest, live on In such an immortality As we thy sons, Born of thy body and nursed At those wild, faithful breasts, Can give—of generous thoughts, And honourable words, and deeds That make men half in love with fate! Live on, O brave and true, In us thy children, in ours whose life is thine— Our best and theirs!  What is that best but thee— Thee, and thy gift to us, to pass Like light along the infinite of space To the immitigable end? "
511,I. M.,"Between the river and the stars, O royal and radiant soul, Thou dost return, thine influences return Upon thy children as in life, and death Turns stingless!  What is Death But Life in act?  How should the Unteeming Grave Be victor over thee, Mother, a mother of men? "

513,XLVII,"CROSSES and troubles a-many have proved me. One or two women (God bless them!) have loved me. I have worked and dreamed, and I’ve talked at will. Of art and drink I have had my fill. I’ve comforted here, and I’ve succoured there. I’ve faced my foes, and I’ve backed my friends. I’ve blundered, and sometimes made amends. I have prayed for light, and I’ve known despair. Now I look before, as I look behind, Come storm, come shine, whatever befall, With a grateful heart and a constant mind, For the end I know is the best of all. "

519,I,"ST. MARGARET’S bells, Quiring their innocent, old-world canticles, Sing in the storied air, All rosy-and-golden, as with memories Of woods at evensong, and sands and seas Disconsolate for that the night is nigh. O, the low, lingering lights!  The large last gleam (Hark! how those brazen choristers cry and call!) Touching these solemn ancientries, and there, The silent River ranging tide-mark high And the callow, grey-faced Hospital, With the strange glimmer and glamour of a dream! The Sabbath peace is in the slumbrous trees, And from the wistful, the fast-widowing sky (Hark! how those plangent comforters call and cry!) Falls as in August plots late roseleaves fall. The sober Sabbath stir— Leisurely voices, desultory feet!— Comes from the dry, dust-coloured street, Where in their summer frocks the girls go by, And sweethearts lean and loiter and confer, Just as they did an hundred years ago, Just as an hundred years to come they will:— When you and I, Dear Love, lie lost and low, And sweet-throats none our welkin shall fulfil, Nor any sunset fade serene and slow; But, being dead, we shall not grieve to die. "
520,II,II _Andante con moto_ 
521,II,"FORTH from the dust and din, The crush, the heat, the many-spotted glare, The odour and sense of life and lust aflare, The wrangle and jangle of unrests, Let us take horse, Dear Heart, take horse and win— As from swart August to the green lap of May— To quietness and the fresh and fragrant breasts Of the still, delicious night, not yet aware In any of her innumerable nests Of that first sudden plash of dawn, Clear, sapphirine, luminous, large, Which tells that soon the flowing springs of day In deep and ever deeper eddies drawn Forward and up, in wider and wider way, Shall float the sands, and brim the shores, On this our lith of the World, as round it roars And spins into the outlook of the Sun (The Lord’s first gift, the Lord’s especial charge), With light, with living light, from marge to marge Until the course He set and staked be run. "
522,II,"Through street and square, through square and street, Each with his home-grown quality of dark And violated silence, loud and fleet, Waylaid by a merry ghost at every lamp, The hansom wheels and plunges.  Hark, O, hark, Sweet, how the old mare’s bit and chain Ring back a rough refrain Upon the marked and cheerful tramp Of her four shoes!  Here is the Park, And O, the languid midsummer wafts adust, The tired midsummer blooms! O, the mysterious distances, the glooms Romantic, the august And solemn shapes!  At night this City of Trees Turns to a tryst of vague and strange And monstrous Majesties, Let loose from some dim underworld to range These terrene vistas till their twilight sets: When, dispossessed of wonderfulness, they stand Beggared and common, plain to all the land For stooks of leaves!  And lo! the Wizard Hour, His silent, shining sorcery winged with power! Still, still the streets, between their carcanets Of linking gold, are avenues of sleep. But see how gable ends and parapets In gradual beauty and significance Emerge!  And did you hear That little twitter-and-cheep, Breaking inordinately loud and clear On this still, spectral, exquisite atmosphere? ’Tis a first nest at matins!  And behold A rakehell cat—how furtive and acold! A spent witch homing from some infamous dance— Obscene, quick-trotting, see her tip and fade Through shadowy railings into a pit of shade! And now! a little wind and shy, The smell of ships (that earnest of romance), A sense of space and water, and thereby A lamplit bridge ouching the troubled sky, And look, O, look! a tangle of silver gleams And dusky lights, our River and all his dreams, His dreams that never save in our deaths can die. "
523,II,"What miracle is happening in the air, Charging the very texture of the gray With something luminous and rare? The night goes out like an ill-parcelled fire, And, as one lights a candle, it is day. The extinguisher, that perks it like a spire On the little formal church, is not yet green Across the water: but the house-tops nigher, The corner-lines, the chimneys—look how clean, How new, how naked!  See the batch of boats, Here at the stairs, washed in the fresh-sprung beam! And those are barges that were goblin floats, Black, hag-steered, fraught with devilry and dream! And in the piles the water frolics clear, The ripples into loose rings wander and flee, And we—we can behold that could but hear The ancient River singing as he goes, New-mailed in morning, to the ancient Sea. The gas burns lank and jaded in its glass: The old Ruffian soon shall yawn himself awake, And light his pipe, and shoulder his tools, and take His hobnailed way to work! "
524,II,"Let us too pass— Pass ere the sun leaps and your shadow shows— Through these long, blindfold rows Of casements staring blind to right and left, Each with his gaze turned inward on some piece Of life in death’s own likeness—Life bereft Of living looks as by the Great Release— Pass to an exquisite night’s more exquisite close! "
525,II,"Reach upon reach of burial—so they feel, These colonies of dreams!  And as we steal Homeward together, but for the buxom breeze, Fitfully frolicking to heel With news of dawn-drenched woods and tumbling seas, We might—thus awed, thus lonely that we are— Be wandering some dispeopled star, Some world of memories and unbroken graves, So broods the abounding Silence near and far: Till even your footfall craves Forgiveness of the majesty it braves. "
526,III,III _Scherzando_ 
527,III,"DOWN through the ancient Strand The spirit of October, mild and boon And sauntering, takes his way This golden end of afternoon, As though the corn stood yellow in all the land, And the ripe apples dropped to the harvest-moon. "
528,III,"Lo! the round sun, half-down the western slope— Seen as along an unglazed telescope— Lingers and lolls, loth to be done with day: Gifting the long, lean, lanky street And its abounding confluences of being With aspects generous and bland; Making a thousand harnesses to shine As with new ore from some enchanted mine, And every horse’s coat so full of sheen He looks new-tailored, and every ’bus feels clean, And never a hansom but is worth the feeing; And every jeweller within the pale Offers a real Arabian Night for sale; And even the roar Of the strong streams of toil, that pause and pour Eastward and westward, sounds suffused— Seems as it were bemused And blurred, and like the speech Of lazy seas on a lotus-haunted beach— With this enchanted lustrousness, This mellow magic, that (as a man’s caress Brings back to some faded face, beloved before, A heavenly shadow of the grace it wore Ere the poor eyes were minded to beseech) Old things transfigures, and you hail and bless Their looks of long-lapsed loveliness once more: Till Clement’s, angular and cold and staid, Gleams forth in glamour’s very stuffs arrayed; And Bride’s, her aëry, unsubstantial charm Through flight on flight of springing, soaring stone Grown flushed and warm, Laughs into life full-mooded and fresh-blown; And the high majesty of Paul’s Uplifts a voice of living light, and calls— Calls to his millions to behold and see How goodly this his London Town can be! "
529,III,"For earth and sky and air Are golden everywhere, And golden with a gold so suave and fine The looking on it lifts the heart like wine. Trafalgar Square (The fountains volleying golden glaze) Shines like an angel-market.  High aloft Over his couchant Lions, in a haze Shimmering and bland and soft, A dust of chrysoprase, Our Sailor takes the golden gaze Of the saluting sun, and flames superb, As once he flamed it on his ocean round. The dingy dreariness of the picture-place, Turned very nearly bright, Takes on a luminous transiency of grace, And shows no more a scandal to the ground. The very blind man pottering on the kerb, Among the posies and the ostrich feathers And the rude voices touched with all the weathers Of the long, varying year, Shares in the universal alms of light. The windows, with their fleeting, flickering fires, The height and spread of frontage shining sheer, The quiring signs, the rejoicing roofs and spires— ’Tis El Dorado—El Dorado plain, The Golden City!  And when a girl goes by, Look! as she turns her glancing head, A call of gold is floated from her ear! Golden, all golden!  In a golden glory, Long-lapsing down a golden coasted sky, The day, not dies but, seems Dispersed in wafts and drifts of gold, and shed Upon a past of golden song and story And memories of gold and golden dreams. "
530,IV,IV _Largo e mesto_ 
531,IV,"OUT of the poisonous East, Over a continent of blight, Like a maleficent Influence released From the most squalid cellarage of hell, The Wind-Fiend, the abominable— The Hangman Wind that tortures temper and light— Comes slouching, sullen and obscene, Hard on the skirts of the embittered night; And in a cloud unclean Of excremental humours, roused to strife By the operation of some ruinous change, Wherever his evil mandate run and range, Into a dire intensity of life, A craftsman at his bench, he settles down To the grim job of throttling London Town. "
532,IV,"So, by a jealous lightlessness beset That might have oppressed the dragons of old time Crunching and groping in the abysmal slime, A cave of cut-throat thoughts and villainous dreams, Hag-rid and crying with cold and dirt and wet, The afflicted City, prone from mark to mark In shameful occultation, seems A nightmare labyrinthine, dim and drifting, With wavering gulfs and antic heights, and shifting, Rent in the stuff of a material dark, Wherein the lamplight, scattered and sick and pale, Shows like the leper’s living blotch of bale: Uncoiling monstrous into street on street Paven with perils, teeming with mischance, Where man and beast go blindfold and in dread, Working with oaths and threats and faltering feet Somewhither in the hideousness ahead; Working through wicked airs and deadly dews That make the laden robber grin askance At the good places in his black romance, And the poor, loitering harlot rather choose Go pinched and pined to bed Than lurk and shiver and curse her wretched way From arch to arch, scouting some threepenny prey. "
533,IV,"Forgot his dawns and far-flushed afterglows, His green garlands and windy eyots forgot, The old Father-River flows, His watchfires cores of menace in the gloom, As he came oozing from the Pit, and bore, Sunk in his filthily transfigured sides, Shoals of dishonoured dead to tumble and rot In the squalor of the universal shore: His voices sounding through the gruesome air As from the Ferry where the Boat of Doom With her blaspheming cargo reels and rides: The while his children, the brave ships, No more adventurous and fair, Nor tripping it light of heel as home-bound brides, But infamously enchanted, Huddle together in the foul eclipse, Or feel their course by inches desperately, As through a tangle of alleys murder-haunted, From sinister reach to reach out—out—to sea. "
534,IV,"And Death the while— Death with his well-worn, lean, professional smile, Death in his threadbare working trim— Comes to your bedside, unannounced and bland, And with expert, inevitable hand Feels at your windpipe, fingers you in the lung, Or flicks the clot well into the labouring heart: Thus signifying unto old and young, However hard of mouth or wild of whim, ’Tis time—’tis time by his ancient watch—to part From books and women and talk and drink and art. And you go humbly after him To a mean suburban lodging: on the way To what or where Not Death, who is old and very wise, can say: And you—how should you care So long as, unreclaimed of hell, The Wind-Fiend, the insufferable, Thus vicious and thus patient, sits him down To the black job of burking London Town? "
535,V,V _Allegro maëstoso_ 
536,V,"SPRING winds that blow As over leagues of myrtle-blooms and may; Bevies of spring clouds trooping slow, Like matrons heavy bosomed and aglow With the mild and placid pride of increase!  Nay, What makes this insolent and comely stream Of appetence, this freshet of desire (Milk from the wild breasts of the wilful Day!), Down Piccadilly dance and murmur and gleam In genial wave on wave and gyre on gyre? Why does that nymph unparalleled splash and churn The wealth of her enchanted urn Till, over-billowing all between Her cheerful margents, grey and living green, It floats and wanders, glittering and fleeing, An estuary of the joy of being? Why should the lovely leafage of the Park Touch to an ecstasy the act of seeing? —Sure, sure my paramour, my Bride of Brides, Lingering and flushed, mysteriously abides In some dim, eye-proof angle of odorous dark, Some smiling nook of green-and-golden shade, In the divine conviction robed and crowned The globe fulfils his immemorial round But as the marrying-place of all things made! "
537,V,"There is no man, this deifying day, But feels the primal blessing in his blood. There is no woman but disdains— The sacred impulse of the May Brightening like sex made sunshine through her veins— To vail the ensigns of her womanhood. None but, rejoicing, flaunts them as she goes, Bounteous in looks of her delicious best, On her inviolable quest: These with their hopes, with their sweet secrets those, But all desirable and frankly fair, As each were keeping some most prosperous tryst, And in the knowledge went imparadised! For look! a magical influence everywhere, Look how the liberal and transfiguring air Washes this inn of memorable meetings, This centre of ravishments and gracious greetings, Till, through its jocund loveliness of length A tidal-race of lust from shore to shore, A brimming reach of beauty met with strength, It shines and sounds like some miraculous dream, Some vision multitudinous and agleam, Of happiness as it shall be evermore! "
538,V,"Praise God for giving Through this His messenger among the days His word the life He gave is thrice-worth living! For Pan, the bountiful, imperious Pan— Not dead, not dead, as impotent dreamers feigned, But the gay genius of a million Mays Renewing his beneficent endeavour!— Still reigns and triumphs, as he hath triumphed and reigned Since in the dim blue dawn of time The universal ebb-and-flow began, To sound his ancient music, and prevails, By the persuasion of his mighty rhyme, Here in this radiant and immortal street Lavishly and omnipotently as ever In the open hills, the undissembling dales, The laughing-places of the juvenile earth. For lo! the wills of man and woman meet, Meet and are moved, each unto each endeared, As once in Eden’s prodigal bowers befell, To share his shameless, elemental mirth In one great act of faith: while deep and strong, Incomparably nerved and cheered, The enormous heart of London joys to beat To the measures of his rough, majestic song; The lewd, perennial, overmastering spell That keeps the rolling universe ensphered, And life, and all for which life lives to long, Wanton and wondrous and for ever well.

547,I,"Hark in the city, street on street A roaring reach of death and life, Of vortices that clash and fleet And ruin in appointed strife, Hark to it calling, calling clear, Calling until you cannot stay From dearer things than your own most dear Over the hills and far away. "

"
567,III,"Deep cellared in primeval ooze, Ruined, dishonoured, spoiled, They lie where the lean water-worm Crawls free of their secrets, and their broken sides Bulge with the slime of life.  Thus they abide, Thus fouled and desecrate, The summons of the Trumpet, and the while These Twain, their murderers, Unravined, imperturbable, unsubdued, Hang at the heels of their children—She aloft As in the shining streets, He as in ambush at some accomplice door.

573,V,"WHY, my heart, do we love her so? (Geraldine, Geraldine!) Why does the great sea ebb and flow?— Why does the round world spin? Geraldine, Geraldine, Bid me my life renew: What is it worth unless I win, Love—love and you? "
574,V,"Why, my heart, when we speak her name (Geraldine, Geraldine!) Throbs the word like a flinging flame?— Why does the Spring begin? Geraldine, Geraldine, Bid me indeed to be: Open your heart, and take us in, Love—love and me. "
575,VI,VI 
576,VI,"ONE with the ruined sunset, The strange forsaken sands, What is it waits, and wanders, And signs with desparate hands? "
577,VI,What is it calls in the twilight— Calls as its chance were vain? The cry of a gull sent seaward Or the voice of an ancient pain? 
578,VI,"The red ghost of the sunset, It walks them as its own, These dreary and desolate reaches . . . But O, that it walked alone! "
579,VII,VII 
580,VII,"THERE’S a regret So grinding, so immitigably sad, Remorse thereby feels tolerant, even glad . . . Do you not know it yet? "
581,VII,"For deeds undone Rankle and snarl and hunger for their due, Till there seems naught so despicable as you In all the grin o’ the sun. "
582,VII,"Like an old shoe The sea spurns and the land abhors, you lie About the beach of Time, till by and by Death, that derides you too— "
583,VII,"Death, as he goes His ragman’s round, espies you, where you stray, With half-an-eye, and kicks you out of his way; And then—and then, who knows "
584,VII,"But the kind Grave Turns on you, and you feel the convict Worm, In that black bridewell working out his term, Hanker and grope and crave? "
585,VII,"‘Poor fool that might— That might, yet would not, dared not, let this be, Think of it, here and thus made over to me In the implacable night!’ "
586,VII,"And writhing, fain And like a triumphing lover, he shall take His fill where no high memory lives to make His obscene victory vain. "
587,VIII,VIII _To_ A. J. H. 
588,VIII,"TIME and the Earth— The old Father and Mother— Their teeming accomplished, Their purpose fulfilled, Close with a smile For a moment of kindness, Ere for the winter They settle to sleep. "
589,VIII,"Failing yet gracious, Slow pacing, soon homing, A patriarch that strolls Through the tents of his children, The Sun, as he journeys His round on the lower Ascents of the blue, Washes the roofs And the hillsides with clarity; Charms the dark pools Till they break into pictures; Scatters magnificent Alms to the beggar trees; Touches the mist-folk, That crowd to his escort, Into translucencies Radiant and ravishing: As with the visible Spirit of Summer Gloriously vaporised, Visioned in gold! "
590,VIII,"Love, though the fallen leaf Mark, and the fleeting light And the loud, loitering Footfall of darkness Sign to the heart Of the passage of destiny, Here is the ghost Of a summer that lived for us, Here is a promise Of summers to be. "
591,IX,IX 
592,IX,"‘AS like the Woman as you can’— (_Thus the New Adam was beguiled_)— ‘So shall you touch the Perfect Man’— (_God in the Garden heard and smiled_). ‘Your father perished with his day: ‘A clot of passions fierce and blind, ‘He fought, he hacked, he crushed his way: ‘Your muscles, Child, must be of mind. "
593,IX,"‘The Brute that lurks and irks within, ‘How, till you have him gagged and bound, ‘Escape the foullest form of Sin?’ (_God in the Garden laughed and frowned_). ‘So vile, so rank, the bestial mood ‘In which the race is bid to be, ‘It wrecks the Rarer Womanhood: ‘Live, therefore, you, for Purity! "
594,IX,"‘Take for your mate no gallant croup, ‘No girl all grace and natural will: ‘To work her mission were to stoop, ‘Maybe to lapse, from Well to Ill. ‘Choose one of whom your grosser make’— (_God in the Garden laughed outright_)— ‘The true refining touch may take, ‘Till both attain to Life’s last height. "
595,IX,"‘There, equal, purged of soul and sense. ‘Beneficent, high-thinking, just, ‘Beyond the appeal of Violence, ‘Incapable of common Lust, ‘In mental Marriage still prevail’— (_God in the Garden hid His face_)— ‘Till you achieve that Female-Male ‘In Which shall culminate the race.’ "
596,X,X 
597,X,"MIDSUMMER midnight skies, Midsummer midnight influences and airs, The shining, sensitive silver of the sea Touched with the strange-hued blazonings of dawn; And all so solemnly still I seem to hear The breathing of Life and Death, The secular Accomplices, Renewing the visible miracle of the world. "
598,X,"The wistful stars Shine like good memories.  The young morning wind Blows full of unforgotten hours As over a region of roses.  Life and Death Sound on—sound on . . . And the night magical, Troubled yet comforting, thrills As if the Enchanted Castle at the heart Of the wood’s dark wonderment Swung wide his valves, and filled the dim sea-banks With exquisite visitants: Words fiery-hearted yet, dreams and desires With living looks intolerable, regrets Whose voice comes as the voice of an only child Heard from the grave: shapes of a Might-Have-Been— Beautiful, miserable, distraught— The Law no man may baffle denied and slew. "
599,X,"The spell-bound ships stand as at gaze To let the marvel by.  The grey road glooms . . . Glimmers . . . goes out . . . and there, O, there where it fades, What grace, what glamour, what wild will, Transfigure the shadows?  Whose, Heart of my heart, Soul of my soul, but yours? "
600,X,"Ghosts—ghosts—the sapphirine air Teems with them even to the gleaming ends Of the wild day-spring!  Ghosts, Everywhere—everywhere—till I and you At last—dear love, at last!— Are in the dreaming, even as Life and Death, Twin-ministers of the unoriginal Will. "
601,XI,XI 
602,XI,"GULLS in an aëry morrice Gleam and vanish and gleam . . . The full sea, sleepily basking, Dreams under skies of dream. "
603,XI,Gulls in an aëry morrice Circle and swoop and close . . . Fuller and ever fuller The rose of the morning blows. 
604,XI,"Gulls, in an aëry morrice Frolicking, float and fade . . . O, the way of a bird in the sunshine, The way of a man with a maid! "
605,XII,XII 
606,XII,"SOME starlit garden grey with dew, Some chamber flushed with wine and fire, What matters where, so I and you Are worthy our desire? "
607,XII,"Behind, a past that scolds and jeers For ungirt loins and lamps unlit; In front, the unmanageable years, The trap upon the Pit; "
608,XII,"Think on the shame of dreams for deeds, The scandal of unnatural strife, The slur upon immortal needs, The treason done to life: "
609,XII,"Arise! no more a living lie, And with me quicken and control Some memory that shall magnify The universal Soul. "
610,XIII,XIII _To_ James McNeill Whistler 
611,XIII,"UNDER a stagnant sky, Gloom out of gloom uncoiling into gloom, The River, jaded and forlorn, Welters and wanders wearily—wretchedly—on; Yet in and out among the ribs Of the old skeleton bridge, as in the piles Of some dead lake-built city, full of skulls, Worm-worn, rat-riddled, mouldy with memories, Lingers to babble to a broken tune (Once, O, the unvoiced music of my heart!) So melancholy a soliloquy It sounds as it might tell The secret of the unending grief-in-grain, The terror of Time and Change and Death, That wastes this floating, transitory world. "
612,XIII,"What of the incantation That forced the huddled shapes on yonder shore To take and wear the night Like a material majesty? That touched the shafts of wavering fire About this miserable welter and wash— (River, O River of Journeys, River of Dreams!)— Into long, shining signals from the panes Of an enchanted pleasure-house, Where life and life might live life lost in life For ever and evermore? "
613,XIII,"O Death!  O Change!  O Time! Without you, O, the insuperable eyes Of these poor Might-Have-Beens, These fatuous, ineffectual Yesterdays! "
614,XIV,XIV _To_ J. A. C. 
615,XIV,"FRESH from his fastnesses Wholesome and spacious, The North Wind, the mad huntsman, Halloas on his white hounds Over the grey, roaring Reaches and ridges, The forest of ocean, The chace of the world. Hark to the peal Of the pack in full cry, As he thongs them before him, Swarming voluminous, Weltering, wide-wallowing, Till in a ruining Chaos of energy, Hurled on their quarry, They crash into foam! "
616,XIV,"Old Indefatigable, Time’s right-hand man, the sea Laughs as in joy From his millions of wrinkles: Laughs that his destiny, Great with the greatness Of triumphing order, Shows as a dwarf By the strength of his heart And the might of his hands. "
617,XIV,"Master of masters, O maker of heroes, Thunder the brave, Irresistible message:— ‘Life is worth Living Through every grain of it, From the foundations To the last edge Of the cornerstone, death.’ "
618,XV,XV 
619,XV,"YOU played and sang a snatch of song, A song that all-too well we knew; But whither had flown the ancient wrong; And was it really I and you? O, since the end of life’s to live And pay in pence the common debt, What should it cost us to forgive Whose daily task is to forget? "
620,XV,"You babbled in the well-known voice— Not new, not new the words you said. You touched me off that famous poise, That old effect, of neck and head. Dear, was it really you and I? In truth the riddle’s ill to read, So many are the deaths we die Before we can be dead indeed. "
621,XVI,XVI 
622,XVI,"SPACE and dread and the dark— Over a livid stretch of sky Cloud-monsters crawling, like a funeral train Of huge, primeval presences Stooping beneath the weight Of some enormous, rudimentary grief; While in the haunting loneliness The far sea waits and wanders with a sound As of the trailing skirts of Destiny, Passing unseen To some immitigable end With her grey henchman, Death. "
623,XVI,"What larve, what spectre is this Thrilling the wilderness to life As with the bodily shape of Fear? What but a desperate sense, A strong foreboding of those dim Interminable continents, forlorn And many-silenced, in a dusk Inviolable utterly, and dead As the poor dead it huddles and swarms and styes In hugger-mugger through eternity? "
624,XVI,"Life—life—let there be life! Better a thousand times the roaring hours When wave and wind, Like the Arch-Murderer in flight From the Avenger at his heel, Storm through the desolate fastnesses And wild waste places of the world! "
625,XVI,"Life—give me life until the end, That at the very top of being, The battle-spirit shouting in my blood, Out of the reddest hell of the fight I may be snatched and flung Into the everlasting lull, The immortal, incommunicable dream. "
626,CARMEN PATIBULARE,XVII CARMEN PATIBULARE _To_ H. S. 
627,CARMEN PATIBULARE,"TREE, Old Tree of the Triple Crook And the rope of the Black Election, ’Tis the faith of the Fool that a race you rule Can never achieve perfection: So ‘It’s O, for the time of the new Sublime And the better than human way, When the Rat (poor beast) shall come to his own And the Wolf shall have his day!’ "
628,CARMEN PATIBULARE,"For Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Beam And the power of provocation, You have cockered the Brute with your dreadful fruit Till your fruit is mere stupration: And ‘It’s how should we rise to be pure and wise, And how can we choose but fall, So long as the Hangman makes us dread, And the Noose floats free for all?’ "
629,CARMEN PATIBULARE,"So Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Coign And the trick there’s no recalling, They will haggle and hew till they hack you through And at last they lay you sprawling: When ‘Hey! for the hour of the race in flower And the long good-bye to sin!’ And for the lack the fires of Hell gone out Of the fuel to keep them in!’ "
630,CARMEN PATIBULARE,"But Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Bough And the ghastly Dreams that tend you, Your growth began with the life of Man, And only his death can end you. They may tug in line at your hempen twine, They may flourish with axe and saw; But your taproot drinks of the Sacred Springs In the living rock of Law. "
631,CARMEN PATIBULARE,"And Tree, Old Tree of the Triple Fork, When the spent sun reels and blunders Down a welkin lit with the flare of the Pit As it seethes in spate and thunders, Stern on the glare of the tortured air Your lines august shall gloom, And your master-beam be the last thing whelmed In the ruining roar of Doom. "
632,MARGARET EMMA HENLEY,XVIII I. M. MARGARET EMMA HENLEY (1888–1894) 
633,MARGARET EMMA HENLEY,"WHEN you wake in your crib, You, an inch of experience— Vaulted about With the wonder of darkness; Wailing and striving To reach from your feebleness Something you feel Will be good to and cherish you, Something you know And can rest upon blindly: O, then a hand (Your mother’s, your mother’s!) By the fall of its fingers All knowledge, all power to you, Out of the dreary, Discouraging strangenesses Comes to and masters you, Takes you, and lovingly Woos you and soothes you Back, as you cling to it, Back to some comforting Corner of sleep. "
634,MARGARET EMMA HENLEY,"So you wake in your bed, Having lived, having loved; But the shadows are there, And the world and its kingdoms Incredibly faded; And you group through the Terror Above you and under For the light, for the warmth, The assurance of life; But the blasts are ice-born, And your heart is nigh burst With the weight of the gloom And the stress of your strangled And desperate endeavour: Sudden a hand— Mother, O Mother!— God at His best to you, Out of the roaring, Impossible silences, Falls on and urges you, Mightily, tenderly, Forth, as you clutch at it, Forth to the infinite Peace of the Grave. "

637,R. L. S.,"O, TIME and Change, they range and range From sunshine round to thunder!— They glance and go as the great winds blow, And the best of our dreams drive under: For Time and Change estrange, estrange— And, now they have looked and seen us, O, we that were dear, we are all-too near With the thick of the world between us. "
638,R. L. S.,"O, Death and Time, they chime and chime Like bells at sunset falling!— They end the song, they right the wrong, They set the old echoes calling: For Death and Time bring on the prime Of God’s own chosen weather, And we lie in the peace of the Great Release As once in the grass together. "
639,R. L. S.,_February_ 1891 
640,XX,XX 
641,XX,"THE shadow of Dawn; Stillness and stars and over-mastering dreams Of Life and Death and Sleep; Heard over gleaming flats, the old, unchanging sound Of the old, unchanging Sea. "
642,XX,"My soul and yours— O, hand in hand let us fare forth, two ghosts, Into the ghostliness, The infinite and abounding solitudes, Beyond—O, beyond!—beyond . . . "
643,XX,"Here in the porch Upon the multitudinous silences Of the kingdoms of the grave, We twain are you and I—two ghosts Omnipotence Can touch no more . . . no more! "
644,XXI,XXI 
645,XXI,"WHEN the wind storms by with a shout, and the stern sea-caves Rejoice in the tramp and the roar of onsetting waves, Then, then, it comes home to the heart that the top of life Is the passion that burns the blood in the act of strife— Till you pity the dead down there in their quiet graves. "
646,XXI,"But to drowse with the fen behind and the fog before, When the rain-rot spreads and a tame sea mumbles the shore, Not to adventure, none to fight, no right and no wrong, Sons of the Sword heart-sick for a stave of your sire’s old song— O, you envy the blesséd death that can live no more! "
647,XXII,XXII 
648,XXII,"TREES and the menace of night; Then a long, lonely, leaden mere Backed by a desolate fell, As by a spectral battlement; and then, Low-brooding, interpenetrating all, A vast, gray, listless, inexpressive sky, So beggared, so incredibly bereft Of starlight and the song of racing worlds, It might have bellied down upon the Void Where as in terror Light was beginning to be. "
649,XXII,"Hist!  In the trees fulfilled of night (Night and the wretchedness of the sky) Is it the hurry of the rain? Or the noise of a drive of the Dead, Streaming before the irresistible Will Through the strange dusk of this, the Debateable Land Between their place and ours? "
650,XXII,"Like the forgetfulness Of the work-a-day world made visible, A mist falls from the melancholy sky. A messenger from some lost and loving soul, Hopeless, far wandered, dazed Here in the provinces of life, A great white moth fades miserably past. "
651,XXII,"Thro’ the trees in the strange dead night, Under the vast dead sky, Forgetting and forgot, a drift of Dead Sets to the mystic mere, the phantom fell, And the unimagined vastitudes beyond. "
652,XXIII,XXIII _To_ P. A. G. 
653,XXIII,"HERE they trysted, here they strayed, In the leafage dewy and boon, Many a man and many a maid, And the morn was merry June. ‘Death is fleet, Life is sweet,’ Sang the blackbird in the may; And the hour with flying feet, While they dreamed, was yesterday. "
654,XXIII,"Many a maid and many a man Found the leafage close and boon; Many a destiny began— O, the morn was merry June! Dead and gone, dead and gone, (Hark the blackbird in the may!), Life and Death went hurrying on, Cheek on cheek—and where were they? "
655,XXIII,"Dust on dust engendering dust In the leafage fresh and boon, Man and maid fulfil their trust— Still the morn turns merry June. Mother Life, Father Death (O, the blackbird in the may!), Each the other’s breath for breath, Fleet the times of the world away. "
656,XXIV,XXIV _To_ A. C. 
657,XXIV,"NOT to the staring Day, For all the importunate questionings he pursues In his big, violent voice, Shall those mild things of bulk and multitude, The Trees—God’s sentinels Over His gift of live, life-giving air, Yield of their huge, unutterable selves. Midsummer-manifold, each one Voluminous, a labyrinth of life, They keep their greenest musings, and the dim dreams That haunt their leafier privacies, Dissembled, baffling the random gapeseed still With blank full-faces, or the innocent guile Of laughter flickering back from shine to shade, And disappearances of homing birds, And frolicsome freaks Of little boughs that frisk with little boughs. "
658,XXIV,"But at the word Of the ancient, sacerdotal Night, Night of the many secrets, whose effect— Transfiguring, hierophantic, dread— Themselves alone may fully apprehend, They tremble and are changed. In each, the uncouth individual soul Looms forth and glooms Essential, and, their bodily presences Touched with inordinate significance, Wearing the darkness like the livery Of some mysterious and tremendous guild, They brood—they menace—they appal; Or the anguish of prophecy tears them, and they wring Wild hands of warning in the face Of some inevitable advance of the doom; Or, each to the other bending, beckoning, signing As in some monstrous market-place, They pass the news, these Gossips of the Prime, In that old speech their forefathers Learned on the lawns of Eden, ere they heard The troubled voice of Eve Naming the wondering folk of Paradise. "
659,XXIV,"Your sense is sealed, or you should hear them tell The tale of their dim life, with all Its compost of experience: how the Sun Spreads them their daily feast, Sumptuous, of light, firing them as with wine; Of the old Moon’s fitful solicitude And those mild messages the Stars Descend in silver silences and dews; Or what the sweet-breathing West, Wanton with wading in the swirl of the wheat, Said, and their leafage laughed; And how the wet-winged Angel of the Rain Came whispering . . . whispering; and the gifts of the Year— The sting of the stirring sap Under the wizardry of the young-eyed Spring, Their summer amplitudes of pomp, Their rich autumnal melancholy, and the shrill, Embittered housewifery Of the lean Winter: all such things, And with them all the goodness of the Master, Whose right hand blesses with increase and life, Whose left hand honours with decay and death. "
660,XXIV,"Thus under the constraint of Night These gross and simple creatures, Each in his scores of rings, which rings are years, A servant of the Will! And God, the Craftsman, as He walks The floor of His workshop, hearkens, full of cheer In thus accomplishing The aims of His miraculous artistry. "

663,XXV,"Where shall the watchful Sun, England, my England, Match the master-work you’ve done, England, my own? When shall he rejoice agen Such a breed of mighty men As come forward, one to ten, To the Song on your bugles blown, England— Down the years on your bugles blown? "
664,XXV,"Ever the faith endures, England, my England:— ‘Take and break us: we are yours, ‘England, my own! ‘Life is good, and joy runs high ‘Between English earth and sky: ‘Death is death; but we shall die ‘To the Song on your bugles blown, ‘England— ‘To the stars on your bugles blown! "
665,XXV,"They call you proud and hard, England, my England: You with worlds to watch and ward, England, my own! You whose mailed hand keeps the keys Of such teeming destinies You could know nor dread nor ease Were the Song on your bugles blown, England, Round the Pit on your bugles blown! "
666,XXV,"Mother of Ships whose might, England, my England, Is the fierce old Sea’s delight, England, my own, Chosen daughter of the Lord, Spouse-in-Chief of the ancient sword, There’s the menace of the Word In the Song on your bugles blown, England— Out of heaven on your bugles blown! "
