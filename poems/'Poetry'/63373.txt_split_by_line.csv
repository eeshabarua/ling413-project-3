286,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Unfaltering faith in life and love
287,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Thine air of confidence.
288,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
289,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And then I see as seers might see
290,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Even as one’s own God.
291,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Thy straight, slim youthfulness"
292,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Bend to the chastening rod.
293,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
294,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I writhe to think I may not bear
295,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The blows, for thine own sake"
296,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I can not, tho’ ’tis mine to know"
297,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",How one small heart can ache.
298,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
299,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",In the winds of thy fierce breaking
300,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",God grant I never see
301,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Thy flashing spirit sullen,"
302,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Or thy lips in mutiny.
303,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
304,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","But rather child, I’d have thee know"
305,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Even as I the rod,"
306,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",As a tuning fork to bring thy song
307,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Back to the harp of God.

313,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
314,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
315,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When I hear the north wind
316,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","It never fails to bring,"
317,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Reminders of for-get-me-nots
318,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And sunny days in spring.
319,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
320,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And O! the east wind carries
321,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Upon its scented sail,"
322,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The tho’t of pink arbutus
323,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",In some secluded vale.
324,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
325,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And how I’d like to gather
326,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","When winds are in the west,"
327,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A brace of orange blossoms
328,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To hold against my breast.
329,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
330,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But O! I love the south wind
331,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","That breathes across the loam,"
332,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For O! the tender south wind
333,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Just whispers dear “come home!”

338,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Friend
339,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
340,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
341,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Last night when I was watching shadows lengthen
342,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","From twilight into deeper, darker lines,"
343,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The lazy river caught my little boat dear,"
344,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And swept it in among the clinging vines.
345,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
346,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And somehow in the mirror of the current
347,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I saw your kindly face look back at me.
348,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Then I reached my eager hands toward you
349,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",As one would do to friends across the sea.
350,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
351,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Friend O! mine, don’t think that I’ve forgotten,"
352,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Tho’ parted now by many a weary mile.
353,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","In every little pool I see reflected,"
354,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Your eyes forever tender with a smile
355,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
356,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And someday when GOD calls me from my dreaming
357,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And draws me from life’s loneliness apart,"
358,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I’ll carry all these things that I remember--
359,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","About you, up to heaven in my heart."

365,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
366,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
367,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I have come a long way
368,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Over sea and sod.
369,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I found nothing small as me,"
370,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Nothing great as GOD.
371,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
372,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",God has in his keeping
373,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Eternities of time.
374,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",He hears worlds of trouble
375,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","But, gives ear to mine."
376,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
377,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","He sways stars and planets,"
378,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",“Keeps the keys of death.”
379,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But in his loving kindness
380,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Paused to give me breath.
381,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
382,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I have seen a mountain

384,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",God has lovely children

390,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Shadows
391,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
392,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
393,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I sat with dreams and mated them with shadows
394,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Where sunlight flecked the grass and trickled thru
395,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Each swaying twig and branch of spruce and elder
396,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Adoringly, they somehow spoke of you."
397,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
398,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I sat tense-eyed, my longing vision sensing,"
399,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","An unseen, art-wise hand begin to trace."
400,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",With all love’s magic trickery displaying
401,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","To me; your hair, your pallid waiting face."
402,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
403,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",In all these voiceless years of night and grieving
404,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Above thy grave I grasp this gleam of grace.
405,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Perhaps sometime, where is no pain or parting"
406,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I’ll smile again into your waiting face.

410,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
411,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Two Roads
412,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
413,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
414,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",There are two roads near Joppa town
415,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And here I doubting stood,"
416,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For one went winding round the hill
417,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The other thru the wood.
418,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
419,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And if I took the winding road
420,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","’Twould lead me thru the mall,"
421,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Of noise and gossipers for which
422,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I have no heart at all.
423,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
424,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Sweet briar nodded from the hill,"
425,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The blue bells from the shade.
426,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A purple finch decided me,"
427,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",So in the wood I stayed.
428,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
429,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A brooding bird and restless young,"
430,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Began to chide and fret.
431,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And wonder in bird fashion what
432,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I ever came to get.
433,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
434,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A green snake ran across my path
435,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Its eyes were jewel small.
436,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A flying squirrel left a tree,"
437,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",That seemed ten paces tall.
438,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
439,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I picked a fern that had uncurled
440,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Itself from out the ground.
441,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And O! the wood delighted me,"
442,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The way it stood around.
443,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
444,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And there were holy moments when
445,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",My very soul went still.
446,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And sad I was for folks who took
447,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The road around the hill.
448,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
449,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And when I left the sancted place,"
450,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",My arms were loaded down.
451,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","It cost me not one pang to shun,"
452,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The road to Joppa town.

458,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
459,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
460,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When I was but a little girl
461,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Mere flotsam on life’s sea,"
462,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Because of youth a lovely rose
463,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Meant, just a rose to me."
464,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
465,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Before I knew that love was life,"
466,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And life were all of love.
467,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The sky was only atmosphere
468,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And God frowned up above.
469,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
470,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But now I am a woman grown
471,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And know love tenderly,"
472,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I can not tell you dear how much
473,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",God’s roses mean to me.

479,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
480,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
481,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When June comes back again I’ll sit
482,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Away back from the road and dip
483,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","My face and arms in clover blooms,"
484,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And drink my fill of their perfumes,"
485,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And steep myself in one great gleam
486,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Of sunlight, and I’ll dream,"
487,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And dream,"
488,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And dream.
489,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
490,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I’ll lean back in the grass and sigh
491,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And look love at the blue, blue sky."
492,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Until my senses reel and reel,"
493,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Like elm tree branches and a feel--
494,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Of drowsiness oozes between,"
495,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","My eyelids, while I dream,"
496,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And dream,"
497,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And dream.
498,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
499,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A lethargy binds tongue and lips,"
500,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And creeps down to my fingertips.
501,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Troubles, cares and everything,"
502,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Float out past my remembering.
503,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And all the world is one great beam
504,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Of gladness, while I dream,"
505,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And dream,"
506,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And dream.

513,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
514,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Like a careless child in the drifts it stood
515,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Against the darkness of the wood,"
516,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Even the path was not cut through
517,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Up to the door it led you to.
518,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Beauty untarnished, but never a sound"
519,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Save for the whispering trees around.
520,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Its shining eyes on the cold world shone
521,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Warm and bright from its snowy comb.
522,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Cheer was the word the blue fume wrote
523,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",As it cleared itself from the chimney’s throat.
524,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The drifts that lay on the tent like sheds
525,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Were like the covers of untouched beds.
526,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A great white garment of snow and frost
527,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Was laid on the fence, but the hedge was lost."
528,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A-while away the home garden park
529,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Divides itself from the woods soft dark.
530,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Dear God I said, you had meant to please"
531,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When giving man such gifts as these.

538,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
539,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I did not always know ’twas kind
540,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Of thee to let me pass,"
541,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And with my sacrilegious feet
542,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Walk lightly thru thy grass.
543,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
544,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","How could I know, when I was young"
545,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","’Twas one of thine own dreams,"
546,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To tender me the license of
547,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Thy hills and singing streams.
548,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
549,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",How could’st thou take even a part

551,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And weld me, poor unworthly link,"
552,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Into this chain of thine.
553,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
554,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",One day I learned at cost of pain
555,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Among the shadows dim,"
556,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Thy gift of violets, Oh! God"
557,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Their fragrance cutting in.
558,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
559,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I set apart one hallowed day
560,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Forever dear to me.
561,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Because thou taughtest me to love
562,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A flowering apple tree.
563,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
564,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And since I’ve older grown and drawn
565,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","To solitudes apart,"
566,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I find I cannot tell the Lord
567,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",All that is in my heart.

575,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Then I go on from here I’ll take
576,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The ever pleasant memory of a lake.
577,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I’ll tightly lock within my spirit breast
578,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The picture of a grim old mountain’s crest.
579,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
580,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A little stream’s song running ever clear
581,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And all the lonely places I hold dear.
582,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A mocking bird, a drenched and dripping tree."
583,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",O! I shall keep my hunger for the sea.
584,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
585,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I shall keep my knowledge of the paths I know
586,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The gates of many mornings and the glow,"
587,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Of sunset, on a firegold window pane,"
588,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The mist on young nasturtiums after rain.
589,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
590,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Virginia creeper on some quaint old garden wall
591,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The sound of dropping nuts, I’ll take them all."
592,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The falling leaves, the closing of the year,"
593,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I’ll not forget, tho’ I go on from here."
594,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
595,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","These tho’ts I shall retain (e’en past the gates of death),"
596,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Of burnished autumn leaves, a tiny baby’s breath."
597,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",In my heart I’ll take the Heaven’s most untried height
598,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A moon drowned flower, from some star riven night."
599,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
600,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I shall remember thru great ages of GOD’S time
601,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The wind in clover, rain in summer time."
602,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Think you I could forget, thru death’s wild fret and pain"

610,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
611,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The wonder never went out of her eyes
612,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","When she saw the sweep of our wide blue skies,"
613,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The things we farmers forget in the pain
614,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Of sowing and planting and reaping again.
615,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
616,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Things taken for granted loose the touch
617,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Of newness and dazzle we love so much.
618,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","While she, soft-eyed and with shining face,"
619,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Found pleasure in all things about the place.
620,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
621,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",She gathered the flowers in wind and rain
622,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",That we called common and tho’t real plain.
623,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",From the sweep of our lawn to the poppy bed
624,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Flaunting their colors about her head.
625,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
626,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Till we ourselves looked with glad new eyes
627,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","On an old, old setting, but a new sunrise."
628,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Cold grey days she would rise and sing
629,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For she found beauty in everything.
630,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
631,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Will she ever know in the city street
632,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","How we think of her when the snow and sleet,"
633,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Make houses enjoyable things to own,"
634,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",How often we mention her name at home?
635,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
636,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Can she ever know with her warm flower heart,"
637,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",How she gave us back what we lost in part.
638,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","How the thought of her when it’s cold with rain,"

647,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The sun, the wind, and rain"
648,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The trees, the flowers and skies,"
649,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A grosbeak’s note
650,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",From its flaming throat
651,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And my bosom is tossed with sighs.
652,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
653,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Eyebeams and locks of hair
654,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The curve of a white cheek near,"
655,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Each day of the week
656,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Filled full of the sweet
657,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Reminders of you, my dear."
658,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
659,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The crowd and the city street,"
660,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A hill that is bleak and bare.
661,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A fleecy cloud
662,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Floating high and proud
663,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And I think of my darling’s hair.
664,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
665,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A voice that is strangely like
666,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Your own that I turn to see;
667,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A silvery laugh,"
668,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Convincing me half
669,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",My dreams have been fooling me.

680,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",That’s why these souls God gave to us
681,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Are always lonely things.
682,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
683,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Because,"
684,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Life is so short, and death so sure,"
685,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And worlds uncertain things,"

687,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Souls have such restless wings.
688,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
689,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Because,"
690,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",’Twas fashioned in the heavenly realm
691,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Of God’s creative schemes,"
692,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",That’s why a soul goes hungrily

695,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
696,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",

698,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Farewell
699,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
700,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
701,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When you are twining wreaths of rose and columbine
702,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","To soften outlines of a tomb too new,"
703,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Remember, spring makes little tents all green and cool"
704,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For soldier boys this old world never knew.
705,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
706,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When spring comes tripping down the lane once more
707,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And children bring you violets of blue,"
708,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","When your tender heart is strained, beyond the breaking"
709,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Let this be my farewell, dear heart, to you."
710,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
711,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","When spring comes romping, singing, back again,"
712,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Dressed in her garments fragrant, fresh and new;"
713,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When once more robins sing among the budding trees
714,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","All honey sweet, with apple blooms and dew."
715,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
716,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When you have searched the woods as once you did
717,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","For specimens of moss and long, dank fern,"
718,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Remember, that I too have loved the flowers"
719,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","But, look no more, no more for my return."

726,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
727,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Bring me rainbow ribbons
728,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And a band of blue,"
729,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Bring me threads of silver
730,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",From the moonbeams’ hue.
731,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Bring a pure cloud fleecy,"
732,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Snatch a sunbeam bright,"
733,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Tints from twilight evenings,"
734,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Matchless and just right,"
735,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To mate with all her beauty.
736,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",These amassed will make the dreams
737,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Tender, pure and holy"
738,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Of a girl just turned thirteen.
739,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
740,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Bring me rainbow ribbons
741,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",From the sunset too
742,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Then a white tho’t from the angels
743,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Who are holding hands with you.
744,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Bring the rosebud’s fragrance
745,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And the apple blossom’s bloom
746,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The hushed voice from the morning
747,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Then leave a little room,"
748,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For a thousand transient colors
749,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",From a God’s infinite dream
750,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And you’ll have the soul and fancies

759,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",My neighbor’s roses always grow
760,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","In such a tantalizing row,"
761,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Of fragrance and perfume,"
762,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A riotous mass of twilight bloom.
763,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And I am tempted oftentimes
764,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","When walking where the stray ones climb,"
765,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To reach my willing hands out so
766,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And clasp each crimson, flaming glow."
767,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A breeze steals softly thru the day
768,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And brushes them too far away.
769,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
770,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Christ! make me kind enough to give
771,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Of roses while my friends yet live.
772,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And if they reach their eager hands,"
773,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","To where my flowers with clinging bands,"
774,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Are nodding, tempting, from the row."
775,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Oh! Christ I pray let breezes blow
776,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A thousand fragrant, tender charms"
777,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Into my neighbor’s outstretched arms.
778,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Then keep my burning heart and tho’t,"
779,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Tender enough to stay them not.

789,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When we are alone in our little den
790,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","He with his pipe and I with my pen,"
791,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",’Twill not be regrets that make us sigh
792,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For we will have things that the world can’t buy.
793,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For we have snatched from the mirth mad throng
794,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A little of love and a deathless song.
795,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A few glad dreams and our tho’ts all white,"
796,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The silence of God, in the long twilight."
797,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
798,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","When “Pop” is bald and my hair is white,"
799,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And we’re nearing the end of the long twilight,"
800,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",’Twill not seem cold in the darksome wood
801,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For we have been friends with solitude.
802,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And often yearned in the shadows cold
803,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For the friendly smiles the gods withold.
804,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Hearts all the braver for the feel of pain,"
805,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For a rose grows sweeter every time it rains.
806,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
807,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A few glad notes from a comrade’s song
808,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",We’ll sing in the night as we go along.
809,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For we carry the blossoms a frost ne’er blights

817,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
818,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When I had left the city street
819,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And lost the open road,"
820,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I breathed contentedly and deep
821,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",As one who shifts a load.
822,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I wasn’t caring where I went
823,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Or where I meant to go.
824,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But I was tossing from my path
825,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The brown leaves drifted so.
826,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
827,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When I was wondering aimlessly
828,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Just what my quest would bring.
829,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I saw a pink arbutus bloom
830,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And heard a warbler sing.
831,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The sky seemed blue and higher here
832,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Than it was back in town.
833,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And Oh! the wind delighted me,"
834,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The way it blew around.
835,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
836,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And then I sought the grey glen road.
837,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Went with it thru the wood.
838,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And in its long green isles I walked
839,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And worshipfully stood.
840,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",My neighbor questioned from the fence
841,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",What I had seen out there?
842,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I said I sought adventure
843,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And I found it everywhere.

851,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","He said goodbye, you hobbled out,"
852,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The Doctor shut the door.
853,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",From your face I knew he’d told you
854,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Things we had guessed before.
855,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
856,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I saw you slightly tremble
857,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But I reached you ere you fell.
858,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Your fixèd face said many things
859,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",More than you cared to tell.
860,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
861,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",One does not receive death warrants
862,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",As one would a courtesy.
863,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",After awhile your head went up
864,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And you talked it all out with me.
865,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
866,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Brave little woman I knew you
867,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Knew you were never afraid.
868,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Not for yourself, You forbid me--"
869,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To speak and my questions you staid.
870,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
871,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",All I could give was silence.
872,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Your pride forbade me much.
873,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Tho’ I longed to bear your burden
874,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Even to be your crutch.
875,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",

880,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
881,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
882,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I’d like to lift the threads of life
883,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And weave them on a loom
884,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And make a pattern beautiful,"
885,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",As any day in June.
886,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
887,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I’d put ten thousand violets
888,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And shimmering leaves of green,"
889,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Around the edge and over it,"
890,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To hide each vulgar seam.
891,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
892,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Because, death brushed me with dark wings,"
893,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Reluctant passed me by,"
894,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I take the threads of life again
895,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And weave and smile and sigh.
896,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
897,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But if I had a God-like power
898,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Omnipotence of mind,"
899,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To put the tho’t of suffering
900,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And death a league behind.
901,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
902,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Life would be violets to me
903,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Much sweeter than a dream.
904,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The pattern on my loom would show
905,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",No raw and ghastly seam.
906,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
907,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But then methinks it is because
908,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Of what the looms disclose.
909,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The breath of life is sweeter
910,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Than the fragrance of a rose.

920,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Master of time, mark every hour"
921,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","As tho’ thou were not pressed,--"

923,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And gently let them chime.
924,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Oh! morn, take off thy wings of speed"
925,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And let this day be mine.
926,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
927,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","O! day, immaculate and kind,"
928,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Make no rude haste or speed.
929,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But loiter in less trodden paths
930,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Walk lightly o’er the mead.
931,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Spring and I are holding hands
932,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",On a green hill’s dazzling crest.

945,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To trifling breezes flung.
946,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
947,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I was distressed and sad to think
948,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",You did not even care.
949,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But once your harp sang low and sweet
950,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",You breathed a solemn prayer.
951,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
952,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",You sang soft broken numbers
953,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Sad as your soul’s distress,"
954,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And I loved you no matter how wanton
955,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Or scarlet or scanty your dress.

965,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And let me follow singing streams,"
966,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",So cool with tossing spray.
967,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And riot in their pebbled beds
968,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Where willows bend and swirl

970,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","When I was, “little girl.”"
971,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
972,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And let me feel again the clutch
973,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",One gets down in the throat
974,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","From long admiring, silent things"
975,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Faint sounds and clouds afloat.
976,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Let afternoon slip languidly,"
977,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Tree branches bend and twirl
978,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Adoringly: as once they did
979,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When I was “little girl.”
980,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
981,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Give me one riotous unbound day
982,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To climb a dizzy hill.
983,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Waist deep in laurel, where wood birds"
984,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Gyrate and mock and trill.
985,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Where even timid walkers’ steps
986,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Unloose great rocks that hurl,"

990,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Grant me one free unbounded day

993,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Moon dazzle from the door.
994,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Oh! riotous day detain my steps
995,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Clasp me from this mist whirl

1007,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The babbling of voices
1008,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The restlessness of feet.
1009,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I often wish my friends would talk
1010,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Less dexterous and less clever,"
1011,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And let me say a word about
1012,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",My old house and the weather.
1013,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1014,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I long to stop those restless feet
1015,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And if I only could,"
1016,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I’d still their babbling tongues awhile
1017,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",With back-home quietude.
1018,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I long to let them know about
1019,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Birches that stand together,"
1020,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And the hand that threw the blooms around
1021,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",My old house and the weather.
1022,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1023,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But as it is I only take
1024,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Mere twigs of it to town,"
1025,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The lilacs when they’re on the bush
1026,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And roses tumbling round.
1027,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But folks forget so hurriedly
1028,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And talk of fuss and feather,"

1041,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And Old Virginia skies.
1042,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The narrow, crooked roadway,"
1043,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The path by which we came,"

1045,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Bluestone river, in the rain."
1046,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1047,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Then there’s the drooping willows
1048,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Swaying, swirling, side by side."
1049,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And the hollyhocks keep nodding
1050,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To each other in the tide.
1051,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And the mists we love o’ mornings
1052,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Puts our dropping tears to shame.
1053,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","When we see it clear the river,"
1054,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Bluestone river, in the rain."
1055,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1056,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And there’s the little homestead
1057,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Just across the running stream,"
1058,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",It beckons from the mountain
1059,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Like a kind hand in a dream.
1060,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A soft, mellow light is breaking"
1061,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","From each golden window pane,"

1073,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But now my heart is filled too full
1074,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Of hunger for the sea.
1075,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1076,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When thinking of the white gulls
1077,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","That ride the creamy foam,"
1078,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I almost hear the brave winds
1079,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",O’er singing seas at home.
1080,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1081,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And when I think of white mists

1083,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",In utter weariness I weep
1084,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But cannot see them more.
1085,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1086,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And some day when I leave my dreams
1087,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","These tides in which I’ve striven,"
1088,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I’ll lock their memories in my breast
1089,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And carry them to heaven.

1096,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1097,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The forest closed and folded
1098,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",About me like a tent.
1099,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The tree tops swayed and toppled
1100,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Rain riven and wind-rent.
1101,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1102,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The old harp in the pine trees
1103,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Struck cords minor and deep.
1104,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",So in the storm tossed forest
1105,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I was rocked to sleep.
1106,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1107,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","That was long ago, O’ ages,"
1108,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Yet thru these rushing years,"

1120,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I wish they’d given me instead
1121,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The name of some nice tree.
1122,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1123,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A tree that rocks with every wind,"
1124,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Fast rooted in the ground,"
1125,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Straining its eager branches up
1126,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To where God’s looking down.
1127,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1128,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A neighbor to the grass and flowers.
1129,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A friend to all the skies,"
1130,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A lovely tree that dares to romp
1131,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",With every bird that flies.
1132,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1133,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A spruce, an elm, a tamarack;"

1142,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1143,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1144,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I have a longing for a hill
1145,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A passion for small streams.
1146,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And there’s a creek that winds itself
1147,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Among my muted dreams.
1148,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1149,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A tumbling stream, you know the kind,"
1150,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","With water running clear,"
1151,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Where birds might bathe between its songs
1152,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And pilgrims hover near.
1153,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1154,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","It twines itself, love-fashion, round"
1155,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A flowering tree, then worms--"
1156,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And oozes in between the roots,"
1157,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Of sycamores and ferns.
1158,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1159,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Petals float down and mingle with

1169,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1170,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I like to visit Endie’s house
1171,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","She’s like a dream herself,"
1172,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",She has the books I know and love
1173,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Upon her reading shelf.
1174,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And when I go to her we talk
1175,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","About the clouds and wind,"
1176,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And if I drop from clouds to clods
1177,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Why; Endie doesn’t mind.
1178,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I like the streams, the singing ones,"
1179,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But Endie likes a fall;
1180,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And if I disagee with her
1181,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",She doesn’t mind at all.
1182,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1183,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Endie has a thousand things
1184,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To plant in one small space;
1185,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When I find it can’t be done
1186,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Regret is in her face.
1187,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","She often says O! dare we plant,"
1188,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Narcissus in a row?
1189,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But she agrees and I agree
1190,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Where hollyhocks should grow.
1191,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I only need to mention tea
1192,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And Endie’s soft eyes shine.
1193,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And then she talks; her language flows
1194,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",More eloquent than mine.
1195,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Once ambition burned my breast
1196,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Endie, too, was fired."
1197,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But here is where I stop to rest
1198,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For Endie’s getting tired.

1204,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1205,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1206,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",We children played in a queer old street
1207,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","That persistently seemed to hide,"
1208,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Itself and us in a kindly way
1209,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",From the great wide world outside.
1210,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1211,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And how we loved in our childishness
1212,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",God’s work on the sea and land.
1213,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","But death was secretive, dark and deep,"
1214,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And never showed us his hand.
1215,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1216,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","With awe we gazed on his work, sad work"
1217,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And the flutter of ribbons white,"
1218,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Made us all catch hands, hold our breath and sob"
1219,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",In our restless dreams at night.
1220,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1221,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When a baby came to our queer old street
1222,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","So downy and vague and new,"
1223,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","We tiptoed out of the soft, dark room,"
1224,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And the mystery grew and grew.
1225,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1226,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But many things we have learned since then
1227,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","For life has a strange sad way,"
1228,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",We left the hills and the queer old street
1229,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Where we used to shout and play.
1230,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1231,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",One of the things we have learned is this:
1232,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Tho’ death rides around rough shod,"
1233,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Back of our births and our deaths and our loves
1234,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Is the all-kind heart of GOD.

1240,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1241,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1242,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",His eyes were wide and large and bright
1243,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","As shining drops of dew,"
1244,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",In which two violets had drowned
1245,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Themselves and made them blue.
1246,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1247,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",His lips were O! so soft to kiss
1248,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",His smile was quaint and funny;
1249,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Couldn’t think of any name
1250,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To call him only Honey.
1251,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1252,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",No one ever tho’t that I
1253,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Was his sister Sue.
1254,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For my eyes were just as black
1255,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",As his eyes were blue.
1256,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1257,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And my hair was like a crow
1258,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",His so golden sunny.
1259,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Father ridicules the name
1260,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But keeps on saying Honey.

1271,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",An understanding ache.
1272,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1273,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",An ardent willow swayed and dipped
1274,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The cool depths of lagoon.
1275,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Unstirred miles of grass and dew
1276,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Lay lonely to the moon.
1277,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1278,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",It seemed I’d never seen a night

1282,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1283,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I marveled thus, and wondered how"

1297,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The help you gave, for which I did not ask."
1298,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1299,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Your unselfishness and kind deeds true,"
1300,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Kept coming up before me like a scroll.
1301,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I could not count the many things you did,"

1303,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1304,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","My undeserving self grew very, very tired."
1305,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","With all the counting of them, and I slept."

1313,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1314,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1315,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And when I saw him stamping over
1316,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","My little patch of shrubs and clover,"
1317,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",His steel bright gun held shoulder high
1318,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I scarce could check, a smothered cry."
1319,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1320,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Because I knew your nest was low
1321,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",So shuddered when I saw him go.
1322,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A gunshot and I scarce could see
1323,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",You had flown screaming to a tree.
1324,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1325,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","O little bird with troubled breast,"
1326,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A miracle has saved your nest.
1327,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I’m sorry you were frightened so,"

1338,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Perplexed and worn out in spirit
1339,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",It followed me into my sleep.
1340,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Then with eyes that were heavy with dreaming
1341,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I drifted from darkness to dawn.
1342,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For the raindrops scattered my shadows
1343,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",With numbers of broken song.
1344,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1345,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I thought of the heavy mystery
1346,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","That troubled me yesterday,"
1347,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",It seemed I never could solve it
1348,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Or drive it completely away.
1349,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And I thought of the thousands of moments
1350,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","When each, to oneself stands alone,"
1351,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Thrown back on oneself for the answer
1352,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The answer that never comes home.
1353,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1354,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",As I pondered each sad broken number

1356,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The shine came to me, came in bundles,"

1370,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Make trim kept acres look half country and half town.
1371,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Where March winds tossed and blew the leaves away
1372,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Into the fences corner yesterday.
1373,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Oaks that never dropt last summer’s leaves at all
1374,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Were coaxed at last today to leave them fall.
1375,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I’m going out to this street’s very end,"

1379,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1380,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I’ll have my hair in torrents blowing wild
1381,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","About my pallid features like some child,"

1383,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Most strangled e’er they ever had begun.
1384,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I’d like to walk around a field that’s barr’d
1385,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",From other pleasant places winter scarr’d.
1386,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Where drifts have filled the corners there I know
1387,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Is still a faint suggestion of late snow.

1412,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The hills that look on Ingleside

1426,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",In search of golden store.
1427,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1428,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And O! how oft with heavy heart
1429,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The weary miles I trod,"
1430,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And many a sorry tale I learned
1431,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Upon the open road.
1432,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1433,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Often times I was made glad
1434,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And oft my heart was sore.
1435,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For folk who traveled on the road
1436,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",That winded by my door.
1437,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1438,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Adventure came, aye many a time,"
1439,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And even now I sigh.
1440,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And sorry am to count the times
1441,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The false gods caught my eye.
1442,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1443,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But now I keep a little spot
1444,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Just off the busy road,"
1445,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And there I patient, wise-eyed wait"
1446,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Those of the heavy load.
1447,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1448,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And kindly then I draw them in
1449,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",While warm heart talks to heart.
1450,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And when night darkens I have found
1451,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",We’re sorry for to part.
1452,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1453,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",This happened too once on a time
1454,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When I was weak and sore.
1455,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I drew a jewel from the road
1456,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",That winded by my door.
1457,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1458,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But then I very often find

1470,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",A fern uncurling from the moss;
1471,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Arbutus trailing lengths along;
1472,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Brown thrush thrilling with his song.
1473,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The grosbeak sings a song of cheer,"
1474,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",“Ain’t” things beautiful this year?
1475,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1476,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The dandelions are here again
1477,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Amongst the grass like golden rain.
1478,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A hawthorn raining petals white,"
1479,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Whilst dripping with the dews of night.
1480,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A mocker’s notes, round, sweet and clear."
1481,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",“Ain’t” things beautiful this year?
1482,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1483,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",So thankful that old winter’s gone
1484,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Fond hearts beat a tender song.
1485,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The meadow lark in circles high,"
1486,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Sings songs of faith against the sky.
1487,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","While in my heart I greatly fear,"
1488,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Things are too beautiful this year.

1495,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1496,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Isn’t there just a hint in the air
1497,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",That spring’s hiding out in the garden somewhere?
1498,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Remember the place where the violets grew?
1499,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Let’s all go and see if they’ve been stirring too.
1500,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","That sounded like wings, O! look it’s a bird."
1501,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",How did he know that the mosses had stirred.
1502,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Before we can really think it is spring
1503,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","He’s here on his faith, and started to sing."
1504,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Someone’s been here, the leaves have been tossed"
1505,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",As if one were looking for things that were lost.
1506,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And ruthlessly left to the late April snow
1507,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The pale slender necks of the first buds below.
1508,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Let’s cover them up, it doesn’t seem fair"
1509,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","To leave them like this, see that birch over there?"
1510,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","We’ll remember the place and come back again,"
1511,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","When the sun is some warmer, and there’s been a rain."
1512,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Let’s walk thru the wood, and come back this way"
1513,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I dislike to go home, I wish it were May."
1514,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Here’s a place I adore, this tender dark wood."
1515,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","It’s a source of delight, and if one only could"
1516,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Just come here and visit awhile every day,"
1517,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",’Twould charm every heartache one has quite away.
1518,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",This path has surprises at every bend.
1519,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",This log has been here since I can’t tell you when.
1520,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","We just walk around or climb over this way,"
1521,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",’Twould spoil the whole scene if they took it away.
1522,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",This tree has been tired standing up long ago
1523,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","’Twas March, the old roughneck, gave it the last blow."
1524,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","It looks like a man-contrived arch o’er a drive,"
1525,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The vines will cling round it and keep it alive.
1526,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I’m tired. Let’s go back, we’ve come a long way"

1535,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Would you like to walk to Elm Court
1536,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Now that winter’s here?
1537,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Yes it is a little chilly,"
1538,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","But you’ll like it, never fear."
1539,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I’d like to see that little path,"
1540,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The one you sketched, you know,"
1541,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",After last night’s storm it surely
1542,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Must be rimmed around with snow.
1543,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The grey grouse slept I’m certain
1544,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Beneath the patches white,"
1545,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The hills protrude a dazzling crest
1546,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Into the dawn’s cold light.
1547,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",If attempts were made to climb
1548,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Up to its softened blue,"
1549,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Every time we stepped up one
1550,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",We’d slip back more than two.
1551,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","But now, we’ll just go thru this woods"
1552,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And this deep snow, my dear,"
1553,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Will make a worth while picture
1554,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For it’s beautiful this year.
1555,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Let us plow thru this deep snow drift
1556,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","To that small half frozen stream,"
1557,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",We’ll see nicer ferns I’ll wager
1558,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Than a summer’s ever seen.
1559,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Ferns in winter? yes there’s plenty.
1560,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Will you only just look here
1561,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",How frost fashions from plain water
1562,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Things so beautiful and queer.
1563,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Wait awhile! here’s beauty,"
1564,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",This stream bank’s frozen dirt
1565,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Boasts an edge as sweet and dainty
1566,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",As a lady’s underskirt.
1567,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",In summer this is lovely
1568,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But old winter has its charms
1569,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When these tender little trees stand round
1570,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",With ice clothes on their arms.
1571,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","It’s very quiet, but lonely never,"
1572,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",You can push these twigs apart
1573,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And in the softened stillness
1574,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Almost feel and hear God’s heart.
1575,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And one may feel this darkness
1576,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Like soft velvet one unrolls,"
1577,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Its very quiet is soothing,"
1578,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To a city weary soul.
1579,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",See these bushes! all the edges
1580,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Have a perfect picot hem,"
1581,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Like women’s restless fingers
1582,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Had picked up now and then.
1583,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",We must find the pathway back
1584,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","When the sun comes stealing thru,"
1585,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Like old magic, all these wonders"
1586,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Will be dripping from our view.
1587,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I prefer to keep this picture
1588,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Just as we have seen it here,"
1589,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","This lovely morning, to my fancy"
1590,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Is too beautiful, I fear."

1598,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Do you remember the cardinal’s call,"
1599,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Brother O’ mine?
1600,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The hills that we climbed, be they ever so tall,"
1601,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","With never a fear for a hurt or a fall,"
1602,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Wondering ever if skies did fall,"
1603,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Brother O’ mine.
1604,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1605,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Many a hill we’ve climbed since then,"
1606,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Brother O’ mine.
1607,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Been pelted with roses and rinsed with the rain
1608,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Of our sorrowing teardrops time and again;
1609,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Despair in our hearts and a clutch of pain,"
1610,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Brother O’ mine.
1611,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1612,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And there were pebbles that hurt our feet
1613,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Brother O’ mine.
1614,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But the dust of the highway seemed velvet sweet
1615,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Tho’ many a cross and trials we’d meet,"
1616,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","With daisies and graves at our very feet,"
1617,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Brother O’ mine.
1618,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1619,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Father we had in the bygone days,"
1620,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Brother O’ mine.
1621,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And mother to wipe all our tears away.
1622,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Tho’ sodden the sky, and shadows be grey"

1624,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Brother O’ mine.

1630,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1631,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1632,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The flowers upon my lady’s hat,"
1633,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Kept bobbing so this way then that,"
1634,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Until the Church seemed faint and blurred
1635,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The morning Psalms I scarcely heard.
1636,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Unless I see I cannot hear,"
1637,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","So, I just admired that flower so near."
1638,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",’Twas unlike any bloom that blows
1639,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","On trees or waves in garden rows,"
1640,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Where clings the morning glory vine
1641,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Or beds of phlox or columbine,"
1642,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Like nothing in the drowsy south
1643,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","With love songs oozing from its mouth,"
1644,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","In all the languorous, summer noons"
1645,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Or riotous breaths of all perfumes,"
1646,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Like nothing in my garden bed
1647,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Of flowers washed blue or drenched red;
1648,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Peculiarly designed it sat
1649,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And nodded on my lady’s hat.
1650,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I summoned all my powers to wit
1651,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But could not find a name for it.
1652,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1653,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I sought my couch with troubled breast,"
1654,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I could not from my memory wrest
1655,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The name of that tormenting bloom,"
1656,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Till wearied tossing, then I swooned"
1657,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Into forgetfulness and dreamed
1658,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Of lands beyond where sunlight streamed,"
1659,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",In gardens where an angel talked
1660,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",In soft glad whispers as he walked.
1661,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And touched each blossoming bud and bell
1662,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",With pride and love ineffable.
1663,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But one he loved beyond compare;
1664,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",He stooped and kissed the petals rare.
1665,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",With eagerness I did persist
1666,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To see the flower the angel kissed.
1667,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And there it grew a thing intact,"
1668,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The flower upon my lady’s hat.
1669,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",It stood a straight slim tossing flame
1670,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And I had yet to learn its name.
1671,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","With this in mind I tried to talk,"
1672,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But the angel only sped his walk.
1673,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I could have cried for very shame,"
1674,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Then someone called me by my name.
1675,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The room was pink with morning light,"
1676,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Because dreams vanish with the night;
1677,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And things are not what they seem,"
1678,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I called the little flower “dream.”
1679,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",

1684,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1685,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1686,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",It’s the cross that makes the triumph
1687,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","A glorious thing to share,"
1688,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",It’s the sweet behind the bitter
1689,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Makes the burden light to bear.
1690,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",It’s the shine past all the raining
1691,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Of the heart-break and the tear,"
1692,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",It’s the faith in dim tomorrow’s
1693,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Clears the mist from yesteryears.
1694,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1695,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",So I’ll take my shine and shower
1696,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The bitter with the sweet,"
1697,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And I’ll make a friend of sorrow
1698,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Every time we chance to meet.
1699,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Give me triumph with disaster
1700,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And my share of gain and loss
1701,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And I’ll not be asking angels
1702,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","For a sweeter, gentler cross."

1710,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The harp like strings of destiny
1711,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Stretched taut awhile, then broke,"
1712,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",So life gives o’er the battle
1713,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To death’s relentless stroke.
1714,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1715,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",What’s wealth with all its glitter
1716,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When the sands of life are spent?
1717,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",It cannot unfold the curtain
1718,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Of that solitary tent.
1719,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1720,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Fame is just a tempting bauble
1721,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","That comes when least we call,"
1722,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And fate stands thus dividing
1723,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Rain and roses ’mongst us all.
1724,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1725,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Life is just a few short summers,"
1726,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Breath of roses and a prayer.
1727,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Then a little tent to sleep in
1728,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",When we grow too tired to care.
1729,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1730,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The high, the low, the haughty,"
1731,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","The humble, too, meet here."
1732,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And share like common brothers
1733,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The sorrow and the tear.
1734,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1735,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But life must have its raining
1736,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For the master wills it so;
1737,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And broken harps are mended,"
1738,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",After death has struck the blow.
1739,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1740,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1741,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1742,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1743,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To the New Year
1744,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1745,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1746,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",This morning when I saw you
1747,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Looking into my bedroom window,"
1748,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I thought that I disliked you very much,"
1749,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For all I could see
1750,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",You very much resembled other days
1751,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Spotless and so wholesome,"
1752,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","With all your tinsel bright,"
1753,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","But, your beauty touched me not at all."
1754,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",But I decided to put up with you
1755,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","As one would with strange, unwelcome guests."
1756,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","I turned you around and about many, many times,"
1757,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",As a child would a new toy.
1758,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","You were a lovely sight,"
1759,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And yet I felt a bit depressed,"
1760,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Till of a sudden I thought
1761,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",I saw you smile.
1762,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Or was it only fancy?
1763,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Then I gave you my profoundest thought
1764,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For a short while.
1765,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And way down in your remotest depths
1766,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Great possibilities looked out at me,"
1767,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And I thought of all the things you might do
1768,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",For this restless world.
1769,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","So I fell in love with you,"
1770,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Before you were a half hour old.

1779,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Those friends who are far, far away,"
1780,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",May be thoughtful and generous indeed to a fault
1781,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And kindness itself every day.
1782,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",Not even the hills with the mist on the top
1783,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And the sun shooting flames ’cross the loam,"
1784,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Can make me forget, nor still the wild fret"
1785,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",In my heart for the place I call home.
1786,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1787,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The valleys like Eden are misty and deep:
1788,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",They are washed with the dews of the morn.
1789,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",They but serve to depress me and make me a prey
1790,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",To longings both sad and forlorn.
1791,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",The lilt of the trees and the song of the birds
1792,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Once so cheery have sobered their tone,"
1793,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","For my heartstrings are tied, to a little fireside"

1806,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1807,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Your eager eyes, so near my drooping lids"

1810,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",And tremble at the touches of your hands.
1811,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",
1812,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","Tho’ death should come and seal my eyelids shut,"
1813,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS","And tho’ I tremble at his cold commands,"

1828,"THE STRATFORD CO., PUBLISHERS",You need not always seek him
