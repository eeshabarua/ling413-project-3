35,IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA,IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA 
36,IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA,"In the East ye struggle for glory And power, and wealth, and fame, And time ye expend, and much labor, To trace down your ancestors' name; But here in the land of Dakota Where the winds sweep over the plains, Is winnowed away much useless ""chaff,"" And only true worth remains. "
37,IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA,"In the East ye crush out the life-blood Of innocent children, grown old By premature toiling and labor To fill up your coffers with gold; But here in the Land of Dakota Our children are happy and free, And over the plains of its limitless mains Re-echo their laughter and glee. "
38,IN THE LAND OF DAKOTA,"In the East ye build up great mansions And sky-scrapers gaunt and high, That shut out the glory and grandeur Of the infinite tender sky; But here in the Land of Dakota Our eyes look up on high And our souls learn wonderful lessons From the white clouds sailing by. "
39,THE SEASONS IN NORTH DAKOTA,THE SEASONS IN NORTH DAKOTA 
40,THE SEASONS IN NORTH DAKOTA,Spring--and the wild March wind The snow-covered prairies sweep; From North Dakota's frozen clod The fur-clad Pasque Flowers peep. 
41,THE SEASONS IN NORTH DAKOTA,"Summer--and gentle showers, And soft the zephyrs blow; O'er North Dakota's rolling plains The modest Roses grow. "
42,THE SEASONS IN NORTH DAKOTA,"Autumn--and burnished skies, And parching, sun-scorched sod; And by the wayside still there blooms The stately Goldenrod. "
43,THE SEASONS IN NORTH DAKOTA,Winter--the flowers are dead And fierce the cold winds blow; Yet 'spite of North Dakota's snow The flowers of Hope still grow. 
44,THE DELUGE,THE DELUGE (A Berthold Indian Legend) 
45,THE DELUGE,"Long ago, yes, oh, so long since,-- When the world was young and fair, All the animals were friendly; E'en the bison and the bear Aided man with all their cunning, Helped him with their counsels grave, Helped him as the gods alone can-- Made him wise and strong and brave. And the flowers on the prairies Blossomed ever, shy and sweet, For the land of the Dakotas Knew not frost, nor killing heat. "
46,THE DELUGE,"But there lived a dread god, North Wind, Cruel was he, with heart of stone, Feared of all and loved by no one, Living to himself alone In the land of snow and blizzard, In the land of deadening cold, Plotting ever some new mischief, Some new ravage, cruel and bold. And one day this mighty North Wind Left his throne of ice and snow, In the cold, far distant northland Where the wriggling ice-worms glow; Southward came he, and the flowers Bent their lovely heads in death, For from out his icy nostrils Came an all-destroying breath.-- At the mighty, stately forests Angrily his teeth he gnashed, With one mighty blow he felled them And with chains the rivers lashed; Ceased their laughter and their murmur, Ceased their sweet life-giving flow.-- All the birds and beasts in terror Fled, and knew not where to go; Food they found not, and no shelter, Dying were the mortals all, And a slow relentless snow shroud Draped the earth as with a pall.-- Death supreme reigned; loud the North Wind Roared defiance to the gods!-- Birds and beasts and man in terror Fled, and, dying, called the gods To avenge their death and suffering, To unite them one and all In the holy cause of vengeance, To secure the North Wind's fall.-- And the South Wind, fairest maiden Of the gods, took up their cause; Girded now herself for battle, And after a moment's pause Called unto her loyal brothers, The strong East Wind, and the West, ""Help revenge the suffering mortals""-- And they granted her request. "
47,THE DELUGE,"Strong the fight raged in Dakota 'Twixt the North Wind and his foes, Now one side yields, now the other, Fierce and loud the tempest blows;-- Savagely the monster charges Grappling with his unseen foes While a wild, chaotic blizzard, Such as ne'er was seen, arose, Hiding all within its fury, Made the daylight dark as night, For the very gods were grappling In a last terrific fight.-- "
48,THE DELUGE,"Ages long the battle lasted-- Then the maiden fair and lovely, Smiled benignant on her foe, And his very heart was melting (For 'twas made of ice and snow); Loosed the rivers from their bondage, Vanished now the shroud of snow, And o'er North Dakota's prairies Flowers fair began to grow; With the advent of the flowers Came the birds and beasts and man, Built again their homes and wigwams-- And no more they anxious scan The horizon for the North Wind, Knowing that he's met his fate; But the South Wind, fair and lovely Rules now o'er Dakota's state. "
49,THE DELUGE,"Southward now each year the North Wind Wends his way to see her face, To the land of the Dakotas Where the battle once took place; Smiling sweet, the maiden greets him, Warms again his chilly heart; Satisfied, he briefly lingers-- With him, winter's cold, depart. "
50,NORTH DAKOTA SUNSETS,NORTH DAKOTA SUNSETS 
51,NORTH DAKOTA SUNSETS,"Such beautiful tints in the western skies! Purples and gold and the deepest rose, Crimson and scarlet the heavens suffuse Where the sun of the prairies sinks to repose;-- Spaces where lingering daylight plays With the skirts of night in her sombre gown, Spaces where gathering mists hang low Ere the shadows of night come drooping down.-- Such, North Dakota, thy sunsets are-- Spreading their glory near and far, Flooding the soul with a holier peace That lingers long after the daylight shall cease! "
52,NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT,NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT (The Passing of the Red Man) 
53,NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT,"Low-lying hills, ""bad lands"" and rolling plain, Stretching afar like billows on the main, With winding rivers seeking distant homes, And leagues of virgin prairie Where stately bison roams. "
54,NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT,"The brave Mandan, the Sheyenne and the Sioux, The Chippewa and the Grosventre too, Along the rivers and the plains did dwell; The land they called Dakota, And methink they named it well. "
55,NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT,"And here they lived for centuries untold, Watching the secrets of the plains unfold; Their homes they built and smoked the pipe of peace, And vowed by the Great Spirit Their friendship would not cease. "
56,NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT,*       *       *       *       * 
57,NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT,"Gone are the braves. The papooses and the squaw No longer wait for winter snows to thaw; The tepee's gone, the peace pipe and the dance, Gone, gone, alas! forever, The Red Man's fighting chance. "
58,NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT,"For pale face came, and from Dakota's plain The Red Man drove, and claimed his vast domain; No power on earth could stay the Viking's son, For ""iron men"" are born In the land of midnight sun. "
59,NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT,*       *       *       *       * 
60,NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT,"Onward they came, these Northmen, feared of old, Bold pioneers, to wrest the hidden gold From North Dakota's hills and virgin sod; The ploughshare won the land For these ""master men"" of God. "
61,NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT,*       *       *       *       * 
62,NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT,"Their children now look out on well-tilled fields, And garner wealth, that many a rich mine yields; The argosies of earth their treasures bear-- For empty rank and title and sham, They little care. "
63,NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT,*       *       *       *       * 
64,NORTH DAKOTA--PAST AND PRESENT,"O boys and girls of North Dakota's Land, Guard, love her well! Pledge her your heart and hand! Where else on earth are seen such sunset fires-- What other race can boast More fearless dames and sires! "
65,A PRAIRIE SUNRISE,A PRAIRIE SUNRISE 
66,A PRAIRIE SUNRISE,Gray and silent is the morning-- Shadows like some airy lawn Veil the prairies from our vision; Night is breaking into dawn. 
67,A PRAIRIE SUNRISE,"Look! Along the eastern heavens Yonder cloud a beacon glows, Touching all with mellow brightness; Gray is turning into rose. "
68,A PRAIRIE SUNRISE,"Sombre shadows swiftly vanish-- Gorgeous are the fiery dyes That adorn the far horizons, Flooding earth, and air and skies. "
69,A PRAIRIE SUNRISE,"See! The sun is slowly rising O'er the level fields of grain, Restless, golden billows surging On a vast and boundless main.-- "
70,A PRAIRIE SUNRISE,Hark! A distant sound is breaking Through the stillness deep and calm-- O'er the prairies floats the cadence Of sweet Nature's morning psalm.

86,WE WHO HAVE LIVED IN DAKOTA,"Hard have we worked, and we've conquered, Conquered the Red Man--the sod.-- Over the primeval prairies Forward and onward we've trod. Fought we with sword and with ploughshare, Wresting our bread from the clod-- Virgin and untouched we found it As left by the hand of our God. "
87,WE WHO HAVE LIVED IN DAKOTA,"Yes, we've weathered the blizzards. Crop failures many we've known.-- Early and late have we labored, Felt the cold wind to the bone.-- Glad we have been when our neighbor Garnered the golden grain, Knowing our mortgage was unpaid, And all of our efforts seemed vain. "
88,WE WHO HAVE LIVED IN DAKOTA,"Glad have we been when the harvest Yielded an hundred-fold-- Paying the debt and the mortgage, Lining our pockets with gold. Yes, we still love North Dakota, Knowing she'll compensate well Those who are willing to try her;-- To summer and winter her well. "

99,A DREAM,A DREAM 
100,A DREAM,"It was midnight. And those spirits Who men's destinies control Were in solemn court assembled, Waiting for the bell to toll The final hour of the year; And what happened you will hear: "
101,A DREAM,"Elves and gnomes and dwarfs came tripping On the light fantastic toe, From their distant caves and castles In the land of ice and snow; And the elf-king, white and hoary, From his throne arose and spoke: ""Fellow spirits all, I greet you."" (And just then old Father Time Rang out the old year--1909.) ""Friends, I feel our power is waning,-- Man, our ward, is now proclaiming Among others, a most curious thing, That in a chair he likes to swing Because his ancestor, an ape, Was very apt to use his tape To swing himself from limb to limb Of trees and vines which on them cling. Moreover, he is now so learnéd That to a fossil he is turnèd, Instead of joining our free band Of spirits, in the fairy land."" "
102,A DREAM,"Silence reigned supreme a moment; Then an old dwarf, ripe with age, Arose, and all those elves and fairies Bowed their heads a little space For that ""grand old man,"" whose wisdom In that hall rang loud and clear: ""Time has come when man no longer Feels he needs invoke our aid, For creation, now he tells us, By itself was surely made;-- Blind he is to Nature's teachings, And so wise in his conceit That he would forget the lessons Taught by wayside flowers sweet; By the river and the mountain And the myriad things that creep Upon the earth. And this wondrous Human being calls himself but a machine, Classed among the things he fashions From the metals earth doth yield. Ah, his very heart is hardening-- Love no longer can hold sway When the heir of all creation Says he's only made of clay."" "
103,A DREAM,*       *       *       *       *

117,MEN ARE THREE,MEN ARE THREE 
118,MEN ARE THREE,"There are all kinds of people we meet on the road, As we travel along life's way; And some are surly and some are grave And others are jolly and gay. And some folks are short, while others are tall, Still others are skinny and thin-- And some skip along, a-humming a song, But others are simply all in. But where'er they come from, or whither they go, We pigeon-hole each of them so, We group them, and sort them, and label them all, The short ones, the skinny, and tall. "
119,MEN ARE THREE,"There's the man or the woman, the boy or the girl, That's always a-wishing a share In somebody's fortune, or somebody's fame, Yes, they wish for the moon 'way up there.-- Then there's that group of persons Who talk, talk, and talk, You simply don't know what they say-- From morning till night they keep talking away, And the night is like unto the day.-- But quietly along, on the very same road, Walk others, with little to say, And if they have wishes (What mortals have not?), They put them discreetly away. They're the workers, the lifters of burdens,--who dare To fight for the right if need be, Alone 'gainst a world-- And defiance they hurl To all tyrants wherever they be. "
120,MEN ARE THREE,"You have met these three classes of people, I'm sure, As you've traveled adown life's way-- The folks with their wish-bone enormously grown, And the ""jaw-bones,"" who talk all the day.-- And I know you have shunned them, As others have done From the day that time began, But you've hailed with delight, And you've longed for the sight Of the steady, quiet, ""back-boned"" man. "

139,THE PEACE OF THE WOODS,"Oh, oft when I come to the city, I long for the peace of the woods; For the sighing of winds in the pine trees And the laughter of running brooks; The chatter of squirrel and chipmunk, The call of the shy wood dove.-- Oh, the forest's the place to listen To that grandest of anthems--Love. "
