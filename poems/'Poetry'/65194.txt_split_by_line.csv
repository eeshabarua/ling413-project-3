1126,ACT III--PATHOS,"Trudging down the track alone,"
1127,ACT III--PATHOS,A thousand miles away from home;

1137,ACT III--PATHOS,The Wild and Woolly West
1138,ACT III--PATHOS,
1139,ACT III--PATHOS,
1140,ACT III--PATHOS,You call us wild--just tell me why;
1141,ACT III--PATHOS,’Cause we look sort of rough?
1142,ACT III--PATHOS,You’ll find the boys in this here camp
1143,ACT III--PATHOS,A good long ways from tough.
1144,ACT III--PATHOS,We got no use for lawyers;
1145,ACT III--PATHOS,"Judge Lynch we all respect,"
1146,ACT III--PATHOS,But no one needs to fear the Judge
1147,ACT III--PATHOS,If he carries hisself correct.
1148,ACT III--PATHOS,
1149,ACT III--PATHOS,There was that man Tim Haskins--
1150,ACT III--PATHOS,Tim you know’s a scamp--
1151,ACT III--PATHOS,"Well, he took us for tenderfoots"
1152,ACT III--PATHOS,And tried to run the camp.
1153,ACT III--PATHOS,"Joe Grant took objections, then"
1154,ACT III--PATHOS,"’Fore anyone could tell,"
1155,ACT III--PATHOS,Haskins knifed him through the heart
1156,ACT III--PATHOS,And struck him again as he fell.
1157,ACT III--PATHOS,
1158,ACT III--PATHOS,That set our blood to biling;
1159,ACT III--PATHOS,We were sore as we could be.
1160,ACT III--PATHOS,We dragged Tim to yon canon
1161,ACT III--PATHOS,And strung him to a tree.
1162,ACT III--PATHOS,You’ll see him as you’re passing;
1163,ACT III--PATHOS,He’s near the road down there--
1164,ACT III--PATHOS,Unless he’s served as dinner
1165,ACT III--PATHOS,For wolves or grizzly bear.
1166,ACT III--PATHOS,
1167,ACT III--PATHOS,"Now, back East this ain’t justice,"
1168,ACT III--PATHOS,"But as like as like can be,"
1169,ACT III--PATHOS,If Tim had got a court trial
1170,ACT III--PATHOS,The jury would have set him free.
1171,ACT III--PATHOS,"We don’t want no law like that,"
1172,ACT III--PATHOS,So when a man’s a pest
1173,ACT III--PATHOS,"We hook him to the nearest tree,"

1182,ACT III--PATHOS,“Goodnight! goodnight!” Our last “goodnight!”
1183,ACT III--PATHOS,"To some these words seem sad,"
1184,ACT III--PATHOS,But in this case they’re quite the reverse;
1185,ACT III--PATHOS,They seem to make us glad.
1186,ACT III--PATHOS,"Our hearts they are not heavy,"
1187,ACT III--PATHOS,No tears to dim our sight.
1188,ACT III--PATHOS,’Tis with a kiss and loving smile
1189,ACT III--PATHOS,We breathe our last “goodnight.”
1190,ACT III--PATHOS,
1191,ACT III--PATHOS,"We speak again, our last “goodnight,”"
1192,ACT III--PATHOS,And seal it with a kiss.
1193,ACT III--PATHOS,"We’ve parted--yes, we’ve parted,"
1194,ACT III--PATHOS,Yet both are filled with bliss.
1195,ACT III--PATHOS,"Our last “goodnight” we’ve whispered,"
1196,ACT III--PATHOS,And yet our hearts are light.
1197,ACT III--PATHOS,"A fond embrace, a loving kiss"
1198,ACT III--PATHOS,And then we said “goodnight.”
1199,ACT III--PATHOS,
1200,ACT III--PATHOS,"You think it strange we’re happy,"
1201,ACT III--PATHOS,"Yet the world ne’er seemed so bright,"
1202,ACT III--PATHOS,"And though she’s all the world to me,"
1203,ACT III--PATHOS,We said our last “goodnight.”
1204,ACT III--PATHOS,These sad words I have whispered
1205,ACT III--PATHOS,"To the one that I adore,"
1206,ACT III--PATHOS,But tomorrow is our wedding day;
1207,ACT III--PATHOS,We’ll say “goodnight” no more.

1216,ACT III--PATHOS,Her gentleman friend.
1217,ACT III--PATHOS,"A careless swing, but his heart is true,"
1218,ACT III--PATHOS,Her gentleman friend.
1219,ACT III--PATHOS,Every night at the hour of eight
1220,ACT III--PATHOS,"She’ll lightly trip to the garden gate,"
1221,ACT III--PATHOS,And there with throbbing heart await
1222,ACT III--PATHOS,Her gentleman friend.
1223,ACT III--PATHOS,
1224,ACT III--PATHOS,She’ll calmly gaze through the dewy night
1225,ACT III--PATHOS,For her gentleman friend.
1226,ACT III--PATHOS,Then down the lane who dawns in sight?
1227,ACT III--PATHOS,Her gentleman friend.
1228,ACT III--PATHOS,As he comes near her eyes they glow;
1229,ACT III--PATHOS,Their hearts with love now overflow.
1230,ACT III--PATHOS,Who says he loves this little girl so?
1231,ACT III--PATHOS,Her gentleman friend.
1232,ACT III--PATHOS,
1233,ACT III--PATHOS,Whose mellow voice has a silvery tone?
1234,ACT III--PATHOS,Her gentleman friend.
1235,ACT III--PATHOS,Who tells her he loves her alone?
1236,ACT III--PATHOS,Her gentleman friend.
1237,ACT III--PATHOS,"Who, with a kiss and a fond caress,"
1238,ACT III--PATHOS,Asks her his future life to bless?
1239,ACT III--PATHOS,To whom does she softly answer “yes”?
1240,ACT III--PATHOS,Her gentleman friend.

1247,ACT III--PATHOS,
1248,ACT III--PATHOS,"I hug him closely to my breast,"
1249,ACT III--PATHOS,I smooth his golden curls.
1250,ACT III--PATHOS,"I’m happy when I’m with him,"
1251,ACT III--PATHOS,And proud as any earl.
1252,ACT III--PATHOS,"When I ask, “Whose boy are you?”"
1253,ACT III--PATHOS,"He’ll drop his little toy,"
1254,ACT III--PATHOS,"And running to my arms will cry,"
1255,ACT III--PATHOS,“I’s oo boy.”
1256,ACT III--PATHOS,
1257,ACT III--PATHOS,See his eyes jump with delight
1258,ACT III--PATHOS,When he is on my knee;
1259,ACT III--PATHOS,The world is full of sunshine
1260,ACT III--PATHOS,Since he has come to me.
1261,ACT III--PATHOS,"My happiness is quite complete,"
1262,ACT III--PATHOS,"My peace none could destroy,"
1263,ACT III--PATHOS,"When I hear his sweet lips murmur,"
1264,ACT III--PATHOS,“I’s oo boy.”
1265,ACT III--PATHOS,
1266,ACT III--PATHOS,He is just sixteen months old;
1267,ACT III--PATHOS,He can say “Mama;”
1268,ACT III--PATHOS,Rub his eyes when sleepy
1269,ACT III--PATHOS,"And just lisp, “Papa.”"
1270,ACT III--PATHOS,As he bears us these little words
1271,ACT III--PATHOS,It fills our hearts with joy.
1272,ACT III--PATHOS,"This is all he knows, except,"
1273,ACT III--PATHOS,“I’s oo boy.”

1279,ACT III--PATHOS,
1280,ACT III--PATHOS,
1281,ACT III--PATHOS,I’ve been thinking of the many things
1282,ACT III--PATHOS,That’s happened since we met;
1283,ACT III--PATHOS,"Of the many, many happy days"
1284,ACT III--PATHOS,That I will not forget.
1285,ACT III--PATHOS,With my sweetheart in the mountains
1286,ACT III--PATHOS,"And out upon the plain,"
1287,ACT III--PATHOS,"In the country and the city,"
1288,ACT III--PATHOS,In the sunshine and the rain.
1289,ACT III--PATHOS,Thinking of the kisses stolen
1290,ACT III--PATHOS,"And the kisses you returned,"
1291,ACT III--PATHOS,"The latter, dear, upon my lips,"
1292,ACT III--PATHOS,Indelibly are burned.
1293,ACT III--PATHOS,"Thinking, dear, of love’s sweet nothings"
1294,ACT III--PATHOS,"We’d to each other say,"
1295,ACT III--PATHOS,"And how we’d sit in silence,"
1296,ACT III--PATHOS,"Holding hands ’most every day,"
1297,ACT III--PATHOS,Thinking of the happiness we’ve had
1298,ACT III--PATHOS,’Till now I can not see
1299,ACT III--PATHOS,Another girl in all the world
1300,ACT III--PATHOS,"That looks so good to me,"
1301,ACT III--PATHOS,"As my sweetheart in the country,"
1302,ACT III--PATHOS,Who stole from me my heart.
1303,ACT III--PATHOS,And then the cruel hour arrived--
1304,ACT III--PATHOS,The time we had to part.
1305,ACT III--PATHOS,
1306,ACT III--PATHOS,"But what’s the use of talking,"
1307,ACT III--PATHOS,I know those days have past.
1308,ACT III--PATHOS,They say that there is happiness
1309,ACT III--PATHOS,That is too good to last.
1310,ACT III--PATHOS,We all must have our troubles;
1311,ACT III--PATHOS,"Each must have their share,"
1312,ACT III--PATHOS,And each in turn believes their own
1313,ACT III--PATHOS,The hardest ones to bear.
1314,ACT III--PATHOS,"So, thinking of the past, tonight,"
1315,ACT III--PATHOS,"And of the present too,"
1316,ACT III--PATHOS,With all my love I fear that I
1317,ACT III--PATHOS,Was never meant for you.

1327,ACT III--PATHOS,To this warning now pay heed
1328,ACT III--PATHOS,Always speak the truth.
1329,ACT III--PATHOS,Let others do what e’er they may;
1330,ACT III--PATHOS,In your dealings it will pay
1331,ACT III--PATHOS,"To have your neighbors gladly say,"
1332,ACT III--PATHOS,You always speak the truth.
1333,ACT III--PATHOS,
1334,ACT III--PATHOS,"It’s your one great asset, boy,"
1335,ACT III--PATHOS,Do not be deterred
1336,ACT III--PATHOS,By temptation to deny a truth
1337,ACT III--PATHOS,You’ve said or heard.
1338,ACT III--PATHOS,"So be sure, keep this in view;"

1354,ACT III--PATHOS,"Though tonight we part, I shed no tears, so strange to you"
