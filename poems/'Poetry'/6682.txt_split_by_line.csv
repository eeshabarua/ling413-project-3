94,BEAUTY,"Say not of Beauty she is good,"
95,BEAUTY,"Or aught but beautiful,"
96,BEAUTY,Or sleek to doves' wings of the wood
97,BEAUTY,Her wild wings of a gull.
98,BEAUTY,
99,BEAUTY,Call her not wicked; that word's touch
100,BEAUTY,Consumes her like a curse;
101,BEAUTY,"But love her not too much, too much,"
102,BEAUTY,For that is even worse.
103,BEAUTY,
104,BEAUTY,"O, she is neither good nor bad,"

115,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,"Avoid the reeking herd,"
116,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,"Shun the polluted flock,"
117,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,"Live like that stoic bird,"
118,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,The eagle of the rock.
119,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,
120,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,The huddled warmth of crowds
121,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,Begets and fosters hate;
122,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,"He keeps, above the clouds,"
123,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,His cliff inviolate.
124,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,
125,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,"When flocks are folded warm,"
126,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,"And herds to shelter run,"
127,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,"He sails above the storm,"
128,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,He stares into the sun.
129,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,
130,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,If in the eagle's track
131,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,"Your sinews cannot leap,"
132,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,"Avoid the lathered pack,"
133,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,Turn from the steaming sheep.
134,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,
135,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,If you would keep your soul
136,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,"From spotted sight or sound,"
137,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,Live like the velvet mole;
138,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,Go burrow underground.
139,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,
140,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,And there hold intercourse
141,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,"With roots of trees and stones,"
142,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,"With rivers at their source,"
143,THE EAGLE AND THE MOLE,And disembodied bones.

152,MADMAN'S SONG,"Better to see your temple worn,"
153,MADMAN'S SONG,"Than to forget to follow, follow,"
154,MADMAN'S SONG,After the sound of a silver horn.
155,MADMAN'S SONG,
156,MADMAN'S SONG,Better to bind your brow with willow
157,MADMAN'S SONG,"And follow, follow until you die,"
158,MADMAN'S SONG,"Than to sleep with your head on a golden pillow,"
159,MADMAN'S SONG,Nor lift it up when the hunt goes by.
160,MADMAN'S SONG,
161,MADMAN'S SONG,Better to see your cheek grown sallow
162,MADMAN'S SONG,"And your hair grown gray, so soon, so soon,"
163,MADMAN'S SONG,"Than to forget to hallo, hallo,"
164,MADMAN'S SONG,After the milk-white hounds of the moon.

171,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,
172,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,"_""The Hielan' lassies are a' for spinnin'"
173,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,The Lowlan' lassies for prinkin' and pinnin';
174,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,"My daddie w'u'd chide me, an' so w'u'd my minnie"
175,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,"If I s'u'd bring hame sic a prinkin' leddie.""_"
176,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,
177,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,"Now haud your tongue, ye haverin' coward,"
178,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,"For whilst I'm young I'll go flounced an' flowered,"
179,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,"In lutestring striped like the strings o' a fiddle,"
180,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,Wi' gowden girdles aboot my middle.
181,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,
182,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,"In your Hielan' glen, where the rain pours steady,"
183,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,Ye'll be gay an' glad for a prinkin' leddie;
184,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,"Where the rocks are all bare an' the turf is all sodden,"
185,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,An' lassies gae sad in their homespun an' hodden.
186,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,
187,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,"My silks are stiff wi' patterns o' siller,"
188,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,"I've an ermine hood like the hat o' a miller,"
189,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,"I've chains o' coral like rowan berries,"
190,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,An' a cramoisie mantle that cam' frae Paris.
191,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,
192,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,Ye'll be glad for the glint o' its scarlet linin'
193,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,When the larks are up an' the sun is shinin';
194,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,When the winds are up an' ower the heather
195,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,Your heart'll be gay wi' my gowden feather.
196,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,
197,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,"When the skies are low an' the earth is frozen,"
198,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,"Ye'll be gay an' glad for the leddie ye've chosen,"
199,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,When ower the snow I go prinkin' an' prancin'
200,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,In my wee red slippers were made for dancin'.
201,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,
202,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,It's better a leddie like Solomon's lily
203,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,Than one that'll run like a Hielan' gillie
204,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,"A-linkin' it ower the leas, my laddie,"
205,THE PRINKIN' LEDDIE,In a raggedy kilt an' a belted plaidie!

212,AUGUST,
213,AUGUST,Why should this Negro insolently stride
214,AUGUST,Down the red noonday on such noiseless feet?
215,AUGUST,"Piled in his barrow, tawnier than wheat,"
216,AUGUST,"Lie heaps of smoldering daisies, somber-eyed,"
217,AUGUST,"Their copper petals shriveled up with pride,"
218,AUGUST,"Hot with a superfluity of heat,"
219,AUGUST,Like a great brazier borne along the street
220,AUGUST,"By captive leopards, black and burning pied."
221,AUGUST,
222,AUGUST,"Are there no water-lilies, smooth as cream,"
223,AUGUST,With long stems dripping crystal? Are there none
224,AUGUST,"Like those white lilies, luminous and cool,"
225,AUGUST,Plucked from some hemlock-darkened northern stream
226,AUGUST,"By fair-haired swimmers, diving where the sun"
227,AUGUST,Scarce warms the surface of the deepest pool?

233,THE CROOKED STICK,
234,THE CROOKED STICK,
235,THE CROOKED STICK,First Traveler: What's that lying in the dust?
236,THE CROOKED STICK,Second Traveler: A crooked stick.
237,THE CROOKED STICK,"First Traveler: What's it worth, if you can trust"
238,THE CROOKED STICK,To arithmetic?
239,THE CROOKED STICK,Second Traveler: Isn't this a riddle?
240,THE CROOKED STICK,"First Traveler:                       No, a trick."
241,THE CROOKED STICK,Second Traveler: It's worthless. Leave it where it lies.
242,THE CROOKED STICK,First Traveler: Wait; count ten;
243,THE CROOKED STICK,Rub a little dust upon your eyes;
244,THE CROOKED STICK,"Now, look again."
245,THE CROOKED STICK,"Second Traveler: Well, and what the devil is it, then?"
246,THE CROOKED STICK,First Traveler: It's the sort of crooked stick that shepherds know.
247,THE CROOKED STICK,Second Traveler: Some one's loss!
248,THE CROOKED STICK,"First Traveler: Bend it, and you make of it a bow."
249,THE CROOKED STICK,"Break it, a cross."
250,THE CROOKED STICK,Second Traveler: But it's all grown over with moss!

256,ATAVISM,
257,ATAVISM,
258,ATAVISM,I always was afraid of Somes's Pond:
259,ATAVISM,"Not the little pond, by which the willow stands,"
260,ATAVISM,Where laughing boys catch alewives in their hands
261,ATAVISM,"In brown, bright shallows; but the one beyond."
262,ATAVISM,"There, when the frost makes all the birches burn"
263,ATAVISM,"Yellow as cow-lilies, and the pale sky shines"
264,ATAVISM,"Like a polished shell between black spruce and pines,"
265,ATAVISM,"Some strange thing tracks us, turning where we turn."
266,ATAVISM,
267,ATAVISM,"You'll say I dream it, being the true daughter"
268,ATAVISM,Of those who in old times endured this dread.
269,ATAVISM,Look! Where the lily-stems are showing red
270,ATAVISM,"A silent paddle moves below the water,"
271,ATAVISM,A sliding shape has stirred them like a breath;
272,ATAVISM,Tall plumes surmount a painted mask of death.

280,WILD PEACHES,1
281,WILD PEACHES,
282,WILD PEACHES,When the world turns completely upside down
283,WILD PEACHES,You say we'll emigrate to the Eastern Shore
284,WILD PEACHES,Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;
285,WILD PEACHES,"We'll live among wild peach trees, miles from town."
286,WILD PEACHES,"You'll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown"
287,WILD PEACHES,"Homespun, dyed butternut's dark gold color."
288,WILD PEACHES,"Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,"
289,WILD PEACHES,We'll swim in milk and honey till we drown.
290,WILD PEACHES,
291,WILD PEACHES,"The winter will be short, the summer long,"
292,WILD PEACHES,"The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot,"
293,WILD PEACHES,Tasting of cider and of scuppernong;
294,WILD PEACHES,"All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all."
295,WILD PEACHES,The squirrels in their silver fur will fall
296,WILD PEACHES,"Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot."
297,WILD PEACHES,
298,WILD PEACHES,
299,WILD PEACHES,2
300,WILD PEACHES,
301,WILD PEACHES,The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass
302,WILD PEACHES,Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold.
303,WILD PEACHES,The misted early mornings will be cold;
304,WILD PEACHES,The little puddles will be roofed with glass.
305,WILD PEACHES,"The sun, which burns from copper into brass,"
306,WILD PEACHES,"Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold"
307,WILD PEACHES,"Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold,"
308,WILD PEACHES,Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.
309,WILD PEACHES,
310,WILD PEACHES,"Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover;"
311,WILD PEACHES,A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;
312,WILD PEACHES,The spring begins before the winter's over.
313,WILD PEACHES,By February you may find the skins
314,WILD PEACHES,Of garter snakes and water moccasins
315,WILD PEACHES,"Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear."
316,WILD PEACHES,
317,WILD PEACHES,
318,WILD PEACHES,3
319,WILD PEACHES,
320,WILD PEACHES,When April pours the colors of a shell
321,WILD PEACHES,"Upon the hills, when every little creek"
322,WILD PEACHES,Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake
323,WILD PEACHES,"In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell,"
324,WILD PEACHES,"When strawberries go begging, and the sleek"
325,WILD PEACHES,"Blue plums lie open to the blackbird's beak,"
326,WILD PEACHES,We shall live well--we shall live very well.
327,WILD PEACHES,
328,WILD PEACHES,The months between the cherries and the peaches
329,WILD PEACHES,Are brimming cornucopias which spill
330,WILD PEACHES,"Fruits red and purple, somber-bloomed and black;"
331,WILD PEACHES,"Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches"
332,WILD PEACHES,"We'll trample bright persimmons, while we kill"
333,WILD PEACHES,"Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvas-back."
334,WILD PEACHES,

336,WILD PEACHES,4
337,WILD PEACHES,
338,WILD PEACHES,Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones
339,WILD PEACHES,There's something in this richness that I hate.
340,WILD PEACHES,"I love the look, austere, immaculate,"
341,WILD PEACHES,Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.
342,WILD PEACHES,There's something in my very blood that owns
343,WILD PEACHES,"Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,"
344,WILD PEACHES,"A thread of water, churned to milky spate"
345,WILD PEACHES,Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.
346,WILD PEACHES,
347,WILD PEACHES,"I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,"
348,WILD PEACHES,"Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meager sheaves;"
349,WILD PEACHES,"That spring, briefer than apple-blossom's breath,"
350,WILD PEACHES,"Summer, so much too beautiful to stay,"
351,WILD PEACHES,"Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves,"
352,WILD PEACHES,"And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death."

359,SANCTUARY,
360,SANCTUARY,This is the bricklayer; hear the thud
361,SANCTUARY,Of his heavy load dumped down on stone.
362,SANCTUARY,"His lustrous bricks are brighter than blood,"
363,SANCTUARY,His smoking mortar whiter than bone.
364,SANCTUARY,
365,SANCTUARY,"Set each sharp-edged, fire-bitten brick"
366,SANCTUARY,Straight by the plumb-line's shivering length;
367,SANCTUARY,Make my marvelous wall so thick
368,SANCTUARY,Dead nor living may shake its strength.
369,SANCTUARY,
370,SANCTUARY,Full as a crystal cup with drink
371,SANCTUARY,"Is my cell with dreams, and quiet, and cool...."
372,SANCTUARY,"Stop, old man! You must leave a chink;"
373,SANCTUARY,"How can I breathe? _You can't, you fool!_"

380,THE LION AND THE LAMB,
381,THE LION AND THE LAMB,"I saw a Tiger's golden flank,"
382,THE LION AND THE LAMB,"I saw what food he ate,"
383,THE LION AND THE LAMB,By a desert spring he drank;
384,THE LION AND THE LAMB,The Tiger's name was Hate.
385,THE LION AND THE LAMB,
386,THE LION AND THE LAMB,Then I saw a placid Lamb
387,THE LION AND THE LAMB,Lying fast asleep;
388,THE LION AND THE LAMB,Like a river from its dam
389,THE LION AND THE LAMB,Flashed the Tiger's leap.
390,THE LION AND THE LAMB,
391,THE LION AND THE LAMB,"I saw a Lion tawny-red,"
392,THE LION AND THE LAMB,Terrible and brave;
393,THE LION AND THE LAMB,The Tiger's leap overhead
394,THE LION AND THE LAMB,Broke like a wave.
395,THE LION AND THE LAMB,
396,THE LION AND THE LAMB,In sand below or sun above
397,THE LION AND THE LAMB,He faded like a flame.
398,THE LION AND THE LAMB,"The Lamb said, ""I am Love"";"
399,THE LION AND THE LAMB,"""Lion, tell your name."""
400,THE LION AND THE LAMB,
401,THE LION AND THE LAMB,The Lion's voice thundering
402,THE LION AND THE LAMB,"Shook his vaulted breast,"
403,THE LION AND THE LAMB,"""I am Love. By this spring,"
404,THE LION AND THE LAMB,"Brother, let us rest."""

409,THE CHURCH-BELL,THE CHURCH-BELL
410,THE CHURCH-BELL,
411,THE CHURCH-BELL,
412,THE CHURCH-BELL,As I was lying in my bed
413,THE CHURCH-BELL,I heard the church-bell ring;
414,THE CHURCH-BELL,Before one solemn word was said
415,THE CHURCH-BELL,A bird began to sing.
416,THE CHURCH-BELL,
417,THE CHURCH-BELL,I heard a dog begin to bark
418,THE CHURCH-BELL,And a bold crowing cock;
419,THE CHURCH-BELL,"The bell, between the cold and dark,"
420,THE CHURCH-BELL,Tolled. It was five o'clock.
421,THE CHURCH-BELL,
422,THE CHURCH-BELL,"The church-bell tolled, and the bird sang,"
423,THE CHURCH-BELL,A clear true voice he had;
424,THE CHURCH-BELL,"The cock crew, and the church-bell rang,"
425,THE CHURCH-BELL,I knew it had gone mad.
426,THE CHURCH-BELL,
427,THE CHURCH-BELL,"A hand reached down from the dark skies,"
428,THE CHURCH-BELL,"It took the bell-rope thong,"
429,THE CHURCH-BELL,"The bell cried ""Look! Lift up your eyes!"""
430,THE CHURCH-BELL,The clapper shook to song.
431,THE CHURCH-BELL,
432,THE CHURCH-BELL,"The iron clapper laughed aloud,"
433,THE CHURCH-BELL,Like clashing wind and wave;
434,THE CHURCH-BELL,"The bell cried out ""Be strong and proud!"""
435,THE CHURCH-BELL,"Then, with a shout, ""Be brave!"""
436,THE CHURCH-BELL,
437,THE CHURCH-BELL,"The rumbling of the market-carts,"
438,THE CHURCH-BELL,The pounding of men's feet
439,THE CHURCH-BELL,"Were drowned in song; ""Lift up your hearts!"""
440,THE CHURCH-BELL,The sound was loud and sweet.
441,THE CHURCH-BELL,
442,THE CHURCH-BELL,"Slow and slow the great bell swung,"
443,THE CHURCH-BELL,It hung in the steeple mute;
444,THE CHURCH-BELL,And people tore its living tongue
445,THE CHURCH-BELL,Out by the very root.

453,A CROWDED TROLLEY CAR,The rain's cold grains are silver-gray
454,A CROWDED TROLLEY CAR,"Sharp as golden sands,"
455,A CROWDED TROLLEY CAR,"A bell is clanging, people sway"
456,A CROWDED TROLLEY CAR,Hanging by their hands.
457,A CROWDED TROLLEY CAR,
458,A CROWDED TROLLEY CAR,"Supple hands, or gnarled and stiff,"
459,A CROWDED TROLLEY CAR,Snatch and catch and grope;
460,A CROWDED TROLLEY CAR,"That face is yellow-pale, as if"
461,A CROWDED TROLLEY CAR,The fellow swung from rope.
462,A CROWDED TROLLEY CAR,
