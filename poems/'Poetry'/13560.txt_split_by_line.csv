102,BILLY'S REVERY,
103,BILLY'S REVERY,
104,BILLY'S REVERY,1
105,BILLY'S REVERY,
106,BILLY'S REVERY,"No use talking, it's perplexing,"
107,BILLY'S REVERY,Everything don't look the same;
108,BILLY'S REVERY,Never had these curious feelin's
109,BILLY'S REVERY,Till those MacIntyres came.
110,BILLY'S REVERY,"Quit my plowing long 'fore dinner,"
111,BILLY'S REVERY,Didn't hitch my team again;
112,BILLY'S REVERY,"Spent the day with these new neighbors,"
113,BILLY'S REVERY,Getting 'quainted with the men.
114,BILLY'S REVERY,Talk about the prairie roses!
115,BILLY'S REVERY,"Purtiest flow'rs in all the world,"
116,BILLY'S REVERY,But they look like weeds for beauty
117,BILLY'S REVERY,When I think of that new girl.
118,BILLY'S REVERY,"Strange, she seems so kind of friendly"
119,BILLY'S REVERY,"When I'm awkward, every way,"
120,BILLY'S REVERY,"And my tongue gets hitched and hobbled,"
121,BILLY'S REVERY,Everything I try to say!
122,BILLY'S REVERY,
123,BILLY'S REVERY,
124,BILLY'S REVERY,2
125,BILLY'S REVERY,
126,BILLY'S REVERY,"There's one person, that Jim Johnson,"
127,BILLY'S REVERY,That there man I can't abide;
128,BILLY'S REVERY,"He's been milling around near Nancy,--"
129,BILLY'S REVERY,"Durn his dirty, yaller hide!"
130,BILLY'S REVERY,Never really liked that Johnson;
131,BILLY'S REVERY,"Now, each time I hear his name,"
132,BILLY'S REVERY,"Feel this state's too thickly settled,--"
133,BILLY'S REVERY,"That is, since that new girl came."
134,BILLY'S REVERY,If this making love to women
135,BILLY'S REVERY,"Went like breaking in a horse,"
136,BILLY'S REVERY,"I might stand some show of winning,"
137,BILLY'S REVERY,"'Cause I've learned that game, of course;"
138,BILLY'S REVERY,"But this moonshine folks call 'courting,'"
139,BILLY'S REVERY,I ain't never played that part;
140,BILLY'S REVERY,I can't keep from talking foolish
141,BILLY'S REVERY,When I'm thinking with my heart.
142,BILLY'S REVERY,
143,BILLY'S REVERY,
144,BILLY'S REVERY,3
145,BILLY'S REVERY,
146,BILLY'S REVERY,"Now, those women that you read of"
147,BILLY'S REVERY,"In these story picture books,"
148,BILLY'S REVERY,They can't ride in roping distance
149,BILLY'S REVERY,Of that girl in style and looks.
150,BILLY'S REVERY,"They have waists more like an insect,"
151,BILLY'S REVERY,Corset shaped and double cinched;
152,BILLY'S REVERY,"Feet just right to make a watch charm,"
153,BILLY'S REVERY,"Small, of course, because they're pinched."
154,BILLY'S REVERY,"This here Nancy's like God made her,--"
155,BILLY'S REVERY,"She don't wear no saddle girth,"
156,BILLY'S REVERY,"But she's supple as a willow,"
157,BILLY'S REVERY,And the purtiest thing on earth.
158,BILLY'S REVERY,I'm in earnest; let me ask you--
159,BILLY'S REVERY,'Cause I want to reason fair--
160,BILLY'S REVERY,What durn business has that rope-necked
161,BILLY'S REVERY,Johnson sneaking over there?
162,BILLY'S REVERY,
163,BILLY'S REVERY,
164,BILLY'S REVERY,4
165,BILLY'S REVERY,
166,BILLY'S REVERY,"Hands so soft and strong and tender,"
167,BILLY'S REVERY,"When I shook a ""how de do,"""
168,BILLY'S REVERY,They was loaded sure with something
169,BILLY'S REVERY,Seemed to thrill me through and through;
170,BILLY'S REVERY,Hair as black as fire-burnt prairie;
171,BILLY'S REVERY,Eyes that dance and flash and flirt;
172,BILLY'S REVERY,Every time she smiled she showed you
173,BILLY'S REVERY,Teeth as white's my Sunday shirt.
174,BILLY'S REVERY,Baked us biscuits light as cotton;
175,BILLY'S REVERY,"I can't eat mine any more,--"
176,BILLY'S REVERY,"I must get some better breeches,--"
177,BILLY'S REVERY,Kind o' 'shamed of those I wore;
178,BILLY'S REVERY,"But I'm goin' there to-morrow,"
179,BILLY'S REVERY,"Like enough I'll stay all day,"
180,BILLY'S REVERY,Seems to me too dry for plowing--
181,BILLY'S REVERY,"Durn that Johnson, anyway!"
182,BILLY'S REVERY,
183,BILLY'S REVERY,
184,BILLY'S REVERY,5
185,BILLY'S REVERY,
186,BILLY'S REVERY,"I ain't much on deep-down thinkin',"
187,BILLY'S REVERY,"Reasoning out the way things go,"
188,BILLY'S REVERY,So I s'pose I'll keep on foolin'
189,BILLY'S REVERY,Till in time I get to know.
190,BILLY'S REVERY,I've had chills and fever 'n' ague;
191,BILLY'S REVERY,Suffered till their course was run.
192,BILLY'S REVERY,"Maybe love just keeps on runnin',"
193,BILLY'S REVERY,Till a man has lost--or won.
194,BILLY'S REVERY,One thing certain: I have got it;
195,BILLY'S REVERY,Seems to struck in good and hard.
196,BILLY'S REVERY,Makes me sometimes soft and tender;
197,BILLY'S REVERY,Next thing I would fight my pard.
198,BILLY'S REVERY,"Appetite is surely failing,"
199,BILLY'S REVERY,Sometimes I don't eat a bite;
200,BILLY'S REVERY,"Dream of Nancy all the daytime,"
201,BILLY'S REVERY,"That durn Johnson, half the night."
202,BILLY'S REVERY,
203,BILLY'S REVERY,
204,BILLY'S REVERY,6
205,BILLY'S REVERY,
206,BILLY'S REVERY,"I've just got to get to plowin',"
207,BILLY'S REVERY,"Break a fire-guard 'round my shack,"
208,BILLY'S REVERY,"Plant my sod corn, fix my garden;"
209,BILLY'S REVERY,Everything is goin' to rack.
210,BILLY'S REVERY,I can't work the way I used to;
211,BILLY'S REVERY,"Got to quittin' early now,"
212,BILLY'S REVERY,"Since a little thing that happened,"
213,BILLY'S REVERY,I can't just remember how.
214,BILLY'S REVERY,"I was takin' leave of Nancy,"
215,BILLY'S REVERY,"Standin' out there in the night,"
216,BILLY'S REVERY,And I put my arms around her--
217,BILLY'S REVERY,"Heart stopped beatin', just from fright."
218,BILLY'S REVERY,"Can't express the kind of feelin',--"
219,BILLY'S REVERY,"Words wa'n't never made for this,--"
220,BILLY'S REVERY,"As I drew her face up closer,"
221,BILLY'S REVERY,And I stole my first sweet kiss.

227,THE QUARREL,
228,THE QUARREL,
229,THE QUARREL,1
230,THE QUARREL,
231,THE QUARREL,Things have moved along some smoother
232,THE QUARREL,"Since a week ago to-night,"
233,THE QUARREL,Seems my blood turned all to p'ison--
234,THE QUARREL,Me and Johnson had a fight.
235,THE QUARREL,Caught him twice up there to Nancy's;
236,THE QUARREL,Told him plain to stay away;
237,THE QUARREL,But he didn't seem to notice
238,THE QUARREL,Anything I had to say.
239,THE QUARREL,Caught him settin' there and talkin'
240,THE QUARREL,'Bout the things that he had done--
241,THE QUARREL,Durndest liar on the prairie--
242,THE QUARREL,"Laughing like he thought 'twas fun,"
243,THE QUARREL,Settin' there beside o' Nancy--
244,THE QUARREL,"Settin' down is all he does,"
245,THE QUARREL,"Good for nothin', bug-eyed, loafin',"
246,THE QUARREL,"Wrinkled, yaller, meddlin' cuss!"
247,THE QUARREL,
248,THE QUARREL,
249,THE QUARREL,2
250,THE QUARREL,
251,THE QUARREL,I just let him keep on settin'
252,THE QUARREL,All the whole long evenin' through;
253,THE QUARREL,"When he started off I follered,"
254,THE QUARREL,Told him what I meant to do.
255,THE QUARREL,"""Why,"" says he, ""now, don't git foolish;"
256,THE QUARREL,I ain't skeered o' your light breeze;
257,THE QUARREL,"I'll go thar and set by Nancy,"
258,THE QUARREL,"Spite o' you, when I blame please."""
259,THE QUARREL,"Well, I don't just clear remember"
260,THE QUARREL,"All the doin's that took place,"
261,THE QUARREL,But you'll know the story better
262,THE QUARREL,If you'll look at Johnson's face.
263,THE QUARREL,"As we rode we clinched and wrestled,"
264,THE QUARREL,"Then we tumbled to the ground,"
265,THE QUARREL,"Tore the bunch grass up, and cactus,"
266,THE QUARREL,For a hundred yards around.
267,THE QUARREL,
268,THE QUARREL,
269,THE QUARREL,3
270,THE QUARREL,
271,THE QUARREL,"Got him down, and in the scrimmage"
272,THE QUARREL,"Felt my lasso on the ground,"
273,THE QUARREL,"Tied his legs and bent him over,"
274,THE QUARREL,Bound him like he's sittin' down;
275,THE QUARREL,"Hustled quick to mount my pony,"
276,THE QUARREL,"Threw the loose end round the horn,"
277,THE QUARREL,Thought I'd learn that Mr. Johnson
278,THE QUARREL,He'd missed out in bein' born.
279,THE QUARREL,"Then I dragged him on the prairie,"
280,THE QUARREL,"Through a Turk's Head cactus bed,"
281,THE QUARREL,"Prickly pears and shoestring bushes,--"
282,THE QUARREL,'Twasn't decent what he said.
283,THE QUARREL,"He's so dev'lish fond of settin',"
284,THE QUARREL,Thought I'd fix his settin' end
285,THE QUARREL,So's he'd be more kinder careful
286,THE QUARREL,Settin' by that girl again.
287,THE QUARREL,
288,THE QUARREL,"[Illustration: ""Then I dragged him on the prairie"

295,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
296,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
297,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,1
298,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
299,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"There's a feeling in my bosom,"
300,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Like a hound that's lost the game,"
301,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,After chasing over bunch grass
302,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Till his feet are sore and lame.
303,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I am standing by her dug-out,"
304,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Open stands the sagging door;
305,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Every grassblade speaks of Nancy,"
306,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"But she's gone, to come no more."
307,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"For her father and her mother,"
308,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"And her brothers, late last night,"
309,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Loaded up their prairie schooner,"
310,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"And vamoosed the ranch, 'fore light."
311,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"'Taint no use to stand here cussin',"
312,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,But my heart slumps down like lead
313,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,When I think of losing Nancy
314,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,And to know my dreams are dead.
315,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
316,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
317,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,2
318,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
319,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"It was here I held you, Nancy,"
320,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,When I showed you all my heart;
321,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,When I told you I would always
322,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Be your friend and take your part.
323,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Oh, I thought that in life's lottery"
324,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I had drawn the biggest prize,"
325,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,When I kissed you there that evening
326,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,And looked down into your eyes;
327,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,For I never had such feelin's
328,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Fill my hide clean through and through
329,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Such a hungry, starving longing,"
330,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,To be always close to you.
331,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"But you've gone with all your family,"
332,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"And I'm left to mourn my loss,"
333,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"While the posse hunts your daddie,"
334,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,'Cause he stole Bill Kelly's hoss.
335,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
336,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
337,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,3
338,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
339,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Now, I don't know where you're roaming,"
340,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,And I don't know where'll you'll land;
341,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"But I wish you knew my feelin's,"
342,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,And 'twas clear just how I stand:
343,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"How the good Lord, high in heaven,"
344,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Put a throbbing heart in here,"
345,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,But it starts to pumping backwards
346,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,When it feels that you don't keer.
347,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I'm a roving old jay-hawker,"
348,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Never caught like this before,"
349,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,But I'd give my last possession
350,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,For a glimpse of you once more.
351,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,If we lose your old fool father
352,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Folks 'round here can stand the loss,"
353,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"He was raised in old Missoura,"
354,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Or he'd never stole that hoss.
355,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
356,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"[Illustration: ""I am standing by her dug-out,"
357,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Open stands the sagging door.""]"
358,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
359,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
360,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,4
361,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
362,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,When my mind gets to recalling
363,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"All the happy times we had,"
364,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Good red liquor and tobacco
365,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Gets to tasting kind o' bad.
366,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,You remember on your birthday
367,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"How I drove 'round kind o' late,"
368,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,And we went to Donkey Collins'
369,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"To a dance, to celebrate?"
370,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"When you got up in my wagon,"
371,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Bless my heart, you sure was sweet!"
372,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"You was bound that you'd go barefoot,"
373,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,'Cause your new shoes hurt your feet.
374,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Well, I tell you, pretty Nancy,"
375,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Every minute of that ride
376,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Seemed like floating through the heavens,"
377,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,'Cause you set there by my side.
378,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
379,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
380,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,5
381,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
382,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"When we pulled up at old Collins',"
383,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Quite a bunch was there before,"
384,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"You could hear the fiddler calling,"
385,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,And the scraping on the floor.
386,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Through the dingy sodhouse window
387,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Gleamed a sickly yellow light,"
388,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Where I helped you from the wagon,"
389,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Holding you so loving tight.
390,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Then they called out, ""Choose your pardners,"
391,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Numbers five, six, seven, and eight,"""
392,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"And we hustled up to join in,"
393,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,For we knew that we were late.
394,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,After starting up the music
395,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Something happened--you know what--
396,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"All because I loved you, Nancy,"
397,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,And their manners made me hot.
398,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
399,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
400,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,6
401,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
402,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I just glanced around the circle,"
403,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"When we came to ""Balance, all;"""
404,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,To that mess of cowhide-covered
405,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Feet that stomped at every call.
406,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Sure enough, the thing I looked for"
407,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Come to pass when Aleck Rose
408,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Tried to _dos-a-dos_ by you, dear,"
409,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"And, instead, waltzed on your toes."
410,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Recollect? I stopped the fiddler,"
411,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"And I stopped that stomping crowd,"
412,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Using language that was decent,"
413,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,But was mighty clear and loud:
414,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"""Now, you fellers from the Sand Hills,"
415,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Fight me, or if you refuse"
416,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,You don't dance with me and Nancy
417,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"While a one of you wears shoes!"""
418,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
419,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
420,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,7
421,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
422,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Yes, they took them off, Miss Nancy,"
423,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"In respect for you and me,"
424,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Putting all on equal footing,"
425,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Just the way it ought to be.
426,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,And we went through all the figures
427,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"That we knew in that quadrille,"
428,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"But it didn't seem like dancin',"
429,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Steppin' round so awful still.
430,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Fiddler, even, did his calling"
431,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,In a sort of quiet hush--
432,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"""Swing your pardners,"" ""Back to places,"""
433,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"""Sounds to me like paddlin' mush."""
434,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"""Man in center,"" ""Circle round him,"""
435,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"""All join hands,"" and ""'Way you go,"""
436,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"""Wait fur Betsy, she's in trouble,"
437,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"With a splinter in her toe."""

439,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
440,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,8
441,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
442,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"When I took you home, towards morning,"
443,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Such a night I never saw.
444,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,How the Kansas wind was blowing!
445,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Swift and keen and kind o' raw.
446,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Blew more furious every minute,"
447,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Blew a hole clear through the skies;
448,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Blew so loud, like demons hissing,"
449,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,That the moon was 'fraid to rise.
450,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Got so fierce it blew the stars out,"
451,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Saw them flicker, then go dead,"
452,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"While the blackness, mad and murky,"
453,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Rolled in thunder overhead.
454,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Goin' with it, durn my whiskers!"
455,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Hind wheels riz plumb off the ground;
456,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Goin' 'gainst it, you and me, dear,"
457,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Had to push the hosses down.
458,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
459,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
460,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,9
461,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
462,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Now and then a raindrop whistled
463,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Like a bullet past my head;
464,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"And I hollered out to you, dear,"
465,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"""Scrooch down in the wagon bed."""
466,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Then they come as big as hen eggs;
467,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Struck the hosses stinging raps,"
468,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Till the frightened, tremblin' critters"
469,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Leaped beneath the angry slaps.
470,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Lord a'mighty, how they scampered!"
471,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"While I gripped the lines in tight,"
472,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,As the wagon box sailed upward
473,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Like a mighty wind-borne kite.
474,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Down below us ran the hosses,"
475,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"While we floated through the air,"
476,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"But through all that roaring shakeup,"
477,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"You, dear, never turned a hair."

481,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
482,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"When the lightning flashed around us,"
483,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Rabbits stopped to let us by,--"
484,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Looked as if they said by halting,"
485,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"""We can't race with things that fly!"""
486,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Coyotes sneaked off in the slough grass,"
487,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Prairie dogs stayed in their holes;
488,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"We was lubricated blazes,--"
489,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Couldn't stop to save our souls.
490,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Up the hills we flew like swallows,"
491,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Down the slopes, a hurricane,"
492,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Bumped and jumped the humps and hollows,"
493,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Dragged the ground and riz again.
494,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"And I prayed, ""Dear Lord, save Nancy,"
495,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"For a desperate lover's sake!"""
496,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"You was hangin' to my gallus,"
497,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,And I felt it strain and break.

499,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
500,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,11
501,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
502,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Felt you holdin' to my boot-leg,"
503,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Slattin' in the roarin' gale,"
504,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"So, to save you, I worked for'ard,"
505,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Got the nigh hoss by the tail.
506,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Miles on miles we tore on blindly,"
507,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Had to let the critters roam,"
508,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Till, at last, they turned their noses"
509,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"To the north, and towards their home."
510,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"We went charging down a valley,"
511,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Stopped in something soft and deep;
512,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Wagon box and you and me, dear,"
513,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Landed in a mixed-up heap.
514,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Both the hosses' legs was buried
515,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,And I knew that that was proof
516,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,We had 'lighted on the top of
517,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Old Jim Davis's dug-out roof.

519,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,

521,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,
522,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Now, old Jim was sleeping soundly"
523,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Close beside his faithful wife;
524,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Peace had smoothed his savage wrinkles,"
525,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,All his dreams were free from strife.
526,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"He was safe from ragin' cyclones,"
527,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Wolves could never force his door,"
528,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"All the ills of life had vanished,"
529,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,On his mountain torrent snore.
530,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,So when our descent awoke him
531,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Sitting bolt upright in bed,"
532,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"With the flying hoofs above him,"
533,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Kicking hair off of his head,"
534,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,He aroused his sleeping helpmeet;
535,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Loud his curses and abuse,"
536,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"""Mary, hike your lazy carcass,"
537,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Hell has turned the devil loose."""

552,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"While they strove like thoroughbreds,"
553,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Lunging, plunging, you stayed with them"
554,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Till they both were clear and free.
555,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Riding one, you lashed them forward,"

567,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,And it seemed as if the jolting
568,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,Gave me more than I could stand.
569,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Once I reeled, and would have fallen,"

907,THE SEARCH,"Turned their stock in yonder draw,"
908,THE SEARCH,But an oldish sort of fellow
909,THE SEARCH,Was the only one I saw;
910,THE SEARCH,Rode a speckled chestnut pony
911,THE SEARCH,With a white star in his face;
912,THE SEARCH,"Asked some questions 'bout the country,"
913,THE SEARCH,'Bout the proper crossing-place.
914,THE SEARCH,Pulled out sometime long 'fore daylight.
915,THE SEARCH,"Didn't see them when they passed,"
916,THE SEARCH,But from all the indications
917,THE SEARCH,They was trav'ling pretty fast.
918,THE SEARCH,
919,THE SEARCH,
920,THE SEARCH,11
921,THE SEARCH,
922,THE SEARCH,"""Crossed right here where we are settin',"
923,THE SEARCH,Saw their trail that very day;
924,THE SEARCH,"Struck plumb north, and by my reck'nin'"
925,THE SEARCH,Towards the north they'll likely stay.
926,THE SEARCH,"North of here, by my experience,"
927,THE SEARCH,He'll find grass that's mighty fine.
928,THE SEARCH,Chances are that he'll keep goin'
929,THE SEARCH,Till he strikes Nebraska's line.
930,THE SEARCH,It was just the next day after
931,THE SEARCH,That my cattle scattered so;
932,THE SEARCH,"Some strayed off 'way south to Jimson's,"
933,THE SEARCH,One bunch in the bend below.
934,THE SEARCH,That's the day I met that feller
935,THE SEARCH,(Eyes so black he couldn't see)
936,THE SEARCH,Who kept pumpin' me with questions
937,THE SEARCH,Like you've just been askin' me.
938,THE SEARCH,
939,THE SEARCH,
940,THE SEARCH,12
941,THE SEARCH,
942,THE SEARCH,"""Asked about that prairie schooner,"
943,THE SEARCH,"Said that they was friends of hisn,"
944,THE SEARCH,Like to wore me plumb to frazzles
945,THE SEARCH,With his everlasting quiz'n.
946,THE SEARCH,"Rode a piebald, knock-kneed broncho;"
947,THE SEARCH,"Coat was battered, ripped, and torn;"
948,THE SEARCH,"He was yaller, long, and g'anted"
949,THE SEARCH,Like a steer with holler horn.
950,THE SEARCH,An' you oughter seen his breeches!
951,THE SEARCH,He must sure be shy on sense;
952,THE SEARCH,"Why, they looked like he'd been riding"
953,THE SEARCH,On a bucking barb wire fence.
954,THE SEARCH,"You won't meet him, 'cause I saw him"
955,THE SEARCH,"Coming back across this way,"
956,THE SEARCH,Going eastward where he come from;
957,THE SEARCH,Took the back trail yesterday.
958,THE SEARCH,
959,THE SEARCH,
960,THE SEARCH,13
961,THE SEARCH,
962,THE SEARCH,"""Said he'd found the old man's outfit"
963,THE SEARCH,Moving westward on North Fork.
964,THE SEARCH,"Can't remember all he told me,"
965,THE SEARCH,For he runs a heap to talk.
966,THE SEARCH,Said he'd found out what he wanted;
967,THE SEARCH,"Said he 'had a plan or two,"
968,THE SEARCH,"And the folks that knowed Jim Johnson,"
969,THE SEARCH,Knowed that he would put 'em through.'
970,THE SEARCH,Then there's others took the west trail;
971,THE SEARCH,They got that way huntin' range--
972,THE SEARCH,Funny how folks when they come here
973,THE SEARCH,Get to itchin' for a change!
974,THE SEARCH,I've been stayin' too confinin';
975,THE SEARCH,Never left this herd but once.
976,THE SEARCH,"I'm the oldest puncher round here,--"
977,THE SEARCH,"Been here over fourteen months."""
978,THE SEARCH,
979,THE SEARCH,
980,THE SEARCH,14
981,THE SEARCH,
982,THE SEARCH,"Long before the sun had risen,"
983,THE SEARCH,While the night mist's ghostly veil
984,THE SEARCH,"Hid from view the sloughs and hollows,"
985,THE SEARCH,Billy took the northern trail.
986,THE SEARCH,"Through the sunflowers in the low land,"
987,THE SEARCH,"Plodding over sandstone knolls,"
988,THE SEARCH,Winding through the level stretches
989,THE SEARCH,Dotted thick with treacherous holes
990,THE SEARCH,"Where the prairie dogs sat chattering,"
991,THE SEARCH,"Bolt upright upon their mounds,"
992,THE SEARCH,"While the ground owls sought their burrows,"
993,THE SEARCH,Startled by the warning sounds;
994,THE SEARCH,"Stumbling into buffalo wallows,"
995,THE SEARCH,Dug out in an earlier day
996,THE SEARCH,"By the halting herds that rested,"
997,THE SEARCH,Rolled and bellowed in their play.
998,THE SEARCH,
999,THE SEARCH,
1000,THE SEARCH,15
1001,THE SEARCH,
1002,THE SEARCH,Now and then the sheltered hillside
1003,THE SEARCH,Waved its varicolored flowers
1004,THE SEARCH,"As a greeting to the trav'ler,"
1005,THE SEARCH,Solace to the toilsome hours.
1006,THE SEARCH,"Old Jack Rabbit hopped before him,"
1007,THE SEARCH,"Then sat up, to watch him pass,"
1008,THE SEARCH,Dusky horned-toads scurried nimbly
1009,THE SEARCH,Through the withered buffalo grass.
1010,THE SEARCH,Here and there the buzzing rattler
1011,THE SEARCH,"Whirred a warning, head alert,"
1012,THE SEARCH,"Then retreated from the snapping,"
1013,THE SEARCH,Stinging strokes of Billy's quirt.
1014,THE SEARCH,"Day by day the wild breeze flying,"
1015,THE SEARCH,"With'ring in its scorching heat,"
1016,THE SEARCH,Hummed a tune to labored beating
1017,THE SEARCH,Of the plodding horses' feet.
1018,THE SEARCH,
1019,THE SEARCH,
1020,THE SEARCH,16
1021,THE SEARCH,
1022,THE SEARCH,Day by day this panorama
1023,THE SEARCH,"Passing slowly, dully by,"
1024,THE SEARCH,With the sun's brass disc high gleaming
1025,THE SEARCH,"From a white and cloudless sky,"
1026,THE SEARCH,Sometimes drew fantastic pictures.
1027,THE SEARCH,Many a strange and gruesome sign--
1028,THE SEARCH,Phantom trees and fairy castles--
1029,THE SEARCH,Blurred the far horizon line.
1030,THE SEARCH,Then they'd vanish like the fancies
1031,THE SEARCH,"Of a fever-smitten brain,"
1032,THE SEARCH,"And returning, changed in outline,"
1033,THE SEARCH,Elsewhere on the mighty plain
1034,THE SEARCH,Would allure the eyesore trav'ler
1035,THE SEARCH,Till the very sky above
1036,THE SEARCH,Seemed to mock with vague mirages
1037,THE SEARCH,Every surety of love.
1038,THE SEARCH,
1039,THE SEARCH,
1040,THE SEARCH,17
1041,THE SEARCH,
1042,THE SEARCH,"When each weary day was over,"
1043,THE SEARCH,"Halting near some watering-place,"
1044,THE SEARCH,"Bill unpacked his meager outfit,"
1045,THE SEARCH,"Turned the horses loose to graze,"
1046,THE SEARCH,"Baked his varicolored dough-bread,"
1047,THE SEARCH,On a fire of cattle chips;
1048,THE SEARCH,"Coffee made of green-scummed water,"
1049,THE SEARCH,Nectar to his thirsty lips.
1050,THE SEARCH,On the ground he spread his blanket
1051,THE SEARCH,"And reclining there alone,"
1052,THE SEARCH,Heard the swiftly sweeping breezes
1053,THE SEARCH,Sing in dreary monotone
1054,THE SEARCH,"Strange wild anthems, weird and lonesome,"
1055,THE SEARCH,"Like lost spirits floating by,"
1056,THE SEARCH,While afar in broken measure
1057,THE SEARCH,Swelled the coyotes' yelping cry.
1058,THE SEARCH,
1059,THE SEARCH,
1060,THE SEARCH,18
1061,THE SEARCH,
1062,THE SEARCH,All the varied information
1063,THE SEARCH,Gathered from the few he passed--
1064,THE SEARCH,"Some from herders, some from stragglers"
1065,THE SEARCH,Gave the missing clew at last
1066,THE SEARCH,As to where old Mac was heading;
1067,THE SEARCH,For that telltale band of steel
1068,THE SEARCH,Stamped along the endless roadway
1069,THE SEARCH,"Printed by the turning wheel,"
1070,THE SEARCH,Pressed its image on the memory
1071,THE SEARCH,"Of the settlers coming back,"
1072,THE SEARCH,"Who, when questioned by the searcher,"
1073,THE SEARCH,Told him that the telltale track
1074,THE SEARCH,Had begun to veer to westward
1075,THE SEARCH,After crossing by the way
1076,THE SEARCH,"Leading up the North Platte River,"
1077,THE SEARCH,Where the sand wastes stretch away.
1078,THE SEARCH,
1079,THE SEARCH,
1080,THE SEARCH,19
1081,THE SEARCH,
1082,THE SEARCH,As he crossed this barren prairie's
1083,THE SEARCH,"Sweeping waste of poverty,"
1084,THE SEARCH,Billy paused beside the cripple
1085,THE SEARCH,"Of a wind-torn twisted tree,"
1086,THE SEARCH,"Standing there, marooned forever,"
1087,THE SEARCH,"Where its hapless seed had blown,"
1088,THE SEARCH,"Miles on miles from forest neighbor,"
1089,THE SEARCH,Struggling out its life alone.
1090,THE SEARCH,"Here he stopped, with head uncovered,"
1091,THE SEARCH,"Conscious of a strange appeal,"
1092,THE SEARCH,Yielding to the voiceless longing
1093,THE SEARCH,Human hearts are bound to feel
1094,THE SEARCH,"When their lot is isolation,"
1095,THE SEARCH,And a field of sterile soil
1096,THE SEARCH,Dwarfs and twists the struggling spirit
1097,THE SEARCH,As the body bends with toil.
1098,THE SEARCH,
1099,THE SEARCH,
1100,THE SEARCH,20
1101,THE SEARCH,
1102,THE SEARCH,"Here, that subtle, silent craving,"
1103,THE SEARCH,"Which with life will never end,"
1104,THE SEARCH,Of the lonesome and the needy
1105,THE SEARCH,"For the comfort of a friend,"
1106,THE SEARCH,"Drew the trav'ler to this tree waif,"
1107,THE SEARCH,"And he spread his outfit near,"
1108,THE SEARCH,And they held that sacred converse
1109,THE SEARCH,Which the soul alone can hear.
1110,THE SEARCH,"While the horses browsed the sage brush,"
1111,THE SEARCH,"And the sun withdrew his light,"
1112,THE SEARCH,And the moon in mournful splendor
1113,THE SEARCH,"Ushered in the lonely night,"
1114,THE SEARCH,"He lay down beneath the branches,"
1115,THE SEARCH,Wrapped in musings strange and deep--
1116,THE SEARCH,Thoughts that bore him off in silence
1117,THE SEARCH,O'er the placid sea of sleep.
1118,THE SEARCH,
1119,THE SEARCH,
1120,THE SEARCH,21
1121,THE SEARCH,
1122,THE SEARCH,In his dreams he saw a monarch
1123,THE SEARCH,"Decked in sumptuous array,"
1124,THE SEARCH,Seated on a throne of glory
1125,THE SEARCH,"Bearing royal title, Day."
1126,THE SEARCH,"Then some mighty power transcendent,"
1127,THE SEARCH,"Thrust him from his gorgeous throne,"
1128,THE SEARCH,"Turning all the realm to darkness,"
1129,THE SEARCH,And the world was left alone.
1130,THE SEARCH,"As the shades of gloom were spreading,"
1131,THE SEARCH,By strange flashing threads of light
1132,THE SEARCH,"He beheld in dim-drawn outline,"
1133,THE SEARCH,"On the background of the night,"
1134,THE SEARCH,"Phantom horse and girlish rider,"
1135,THE SEARCH,"Speeding on in reckless race,"
1136,THE SEARCH,Till she turned directly toward him
1137,THE SEARCH,And he saw her fearless face!
1138,THE SEARCH,
1139,THE SEARCH,"[Illustration: ""Faithful Simon, weak and starving,"
1140,THE SEARCH,"Groaned and fell beneath his pack....""]"
1141,THE SEARCH,
1142,THE SEARCH,
1143,THE SEARCH,22
1144,THE SEARCH,
1145,THE SEARCH,With the journey's slow progression
1146,THE SEARCH,"Slipped away the summer days,"
1147,THE SEARCH,Merging with the sleepy beauty
1148,THE SEARCH,Of the lazy autumn haze;
1149,THE SEARCH,And the frosts and drought combining
1150,THE SEARCH,"Waged relentless battle there,"
1151,THE SEARCH,"Withering up the scanty ranges,"
1152,THE SEARCH,Leaving all the country bare.
1153,THE SEARCH,"When he entered Colorado,"
1154,THE SEARCH,Following still the barren plain
1155,THE SEARCH,Where for months the mocking heavens
1156,THE SEARCH,"Never spared a drop of rain,"
1157,THE SEARCH,"Faithful Simon, weak and starving,"
1158,THE SEARCH,Following feebly in the track
1159,THE SEARCH,"Pulled upon his straining halter,"
1160,THE SEARCH,Groaned and fell beneath his pack.
1161,THE SEARCH,
1162,THE SEARCH,
1163,THE SEARCH,23
1164,THE SEARCH,
1165,THE SEARCH,"Vain were all the kind entreaties,"
1166,THE SEARCH,Vain the simple nursing done
1167,THE SEARCH,To relieve his palsied weakness--
1168,THE SEARCH,Poor old Simon's course was run.
1169,THE SEARCH,"Billy spent the night beside him,"
1170,THE SEARCH,"But with next day's early dawn,"
1171,THE SEARCH,"With the east's first flush of scarlet,"
1172,THE SEARCH,Simon's faithful soul passed on.
1173,THE SEARCH,"Then, with hands outstretched before him,"
1174,THE SEARCH,Half remembering what was said
1175,THE SEARCH,When a child he saw the sexton
1176,THE SEARCH,Sprinkle earth upon the dead--
1177,THE SEARCH,"""Dust to dust, and then to ashes--"
1178,THE SEARCH,I forget the other part--
1179,THE SEARCH,"I can't say the words I want to,"
1180,THE SEARCH,I can't think--all's in my heart.
1181,THE SEARCH,
1182,THE SEARCH,
1183,THE SEARCH,24
1184,THE SEARCH,
1185,THE SEARCH,"""Over twenty years, old pardner,"
1186,THE SEARCH,We have been companions true;
1187,THE SEARCH,You have always kept your end up
1188,THE SEARCH,In the hardships we've gone through.
1189,THE SEARCH,"If we'd stayed, and I had never"
1190,THE SEARCH,"Seen her face or touched her hand,"
1191,THE SEARCH,"We should still have been contented,"
1192,THE SEARCH,On our little piece of land.
1193,THE SEARCH,"This strange spell won't let me falter,"
1194,THE SEARCH,Though the chasing never ends;
1195,THE SEARCH,"Seems that nothing ever'll stop it,"
1196,THE SEARCH,"Sickness, death, or loss of friends."
1197,THE SEARCH,"Where this love will drive a fellow,"
1198,THE SEARCH,I ain't wise enough to tell;
1199,THE SEARCH,Sometimes think it leads to heaven
1200,THE SEARCH,"By a trail that runs through hell."""
1201,THE SEARCH,
1202,THE SEARCH,
1203,THE SEARCH,25
1204,THE SEARCH,
1205,THE SEARCH,"Weeks thereafter, plodding northward"
1206,THE SEARCH,"Crossing over Lodge Pole creek,"
1207,THE SEARCH,Threading Colorado's stretches--
1208,THE SEARCH,Sandy deserts wild and bleak--
1209,THE SEARCH,"Where the sun wars on the living,"
1210,THE SEARCH,"Struggling 'neath his blinding light,"
1211,THE SEARCH,Then resigns his work of ravage
1212,THE SEARCH,To the chilling frosts of night;
1213,THE SEARCH,Where the bleaching bones of horses
1214,THE SEARCH,"Here and there bestrew the plains,"
1215,THE SEARCH,Telling many a ghastly story
1216,THE SEARCH,Of misguided settlers' trains--
1217,THE SEARCH,Where the early frontier ranger
1218,THE SEARCH,"Marked the first trail to Cheyenne,"
1219,THE SEARCH,"Billy, following its wand'rings,"
1220,THE SEARCH,Found the missing mark again.
1221,THE SEARCH,
1222,THE SEARCH,
1223,THE SEARCH,26
1224,THE SEARCH,
1225,THE SEARCH,Then the labored pace grew faster
1226,THE SEARCH,"As he passed each camping place,"
1227,THE SEARCH,Marking well the lessening distance
1228,THE SEARCH,In the long-contested race.
1229,THE SEARCH,"Riding through Wyoming's foothills,"
1230,THE SEARCH,With their rugged summit lines
1231,THE SEARCH,"Stretched across the clear horizon,"
1232,THE SEARCH,"Fringed with pointed spruce and pines,"
1233,THE SEARCH,"He beheld, one early morning,"
1234,THE SEARCH,"Rising slowly to the sky,"
1235,THE SEARCH,Smoke--the thin and gauzy column
1236,THE SEARCH,Of a camp fire built close by;
1237,THE SEARCH,"And, on looking down the valley"
1238,THE SEARCH,"With exultant, ringing cheer,"
1239,THE SEARCH,He beheld the prairie schooner
1240,THE SEARCH,And the MacIntyres near.
1241,THE SEARCH,
1242,THE SEARCH,
1243,THE SEARCH,27
1244,THE SEARCH,
1245,THE SEARCH,On an open spot of grass land
1246,THE SEARCH,"Gilded by the rising sun,"
1247,THE SEARCH,Sloping sharply to the crevice
1248,THE SEARCH,"Where the mountain waters run,"
1249,THE SEARCH,"Ike, reclining, watched the horses,"
1250,THE SEARCH,"Now increased to quite a band,"
1251,THE SEARCH,"While above him, in the timber,"
1252,THE SEARCH,"Brother Bill, with gun in hand,"
1253,THE SEARCH,"Held it poised in sudden wonder,"
1254,THE SEARCH,"Half in attitude to shoot,"
1255,THE SEARCH,"As he saw the coming rider,"
1256,THE SEARCH,Heard his loudly yelled salute.
1257,THE SEARCH,"Near an old abandoned cabin,"
1258,THE SEARCH,"Huddled by the breakfast fire,"
1259,THE SEARCH,Resting calm in fancied safety

1269,THE SEARCH,What new game you playing now?
1270,THE SEARCH,If you're out on posse business
1271,THE SEARCH,"By the gods, jest start your row!"
1272,THE SEARCH,What you saying? You are friendly?
1273,THE SEARCH,"Wal, I'm glad to hear it's so;"
1274,THE SEARCH,And I s'pose you made the journey
1275,THE SEARCH,Way out here to let me know!
1276,THE SEARCH,Oh! you're talking 'bout our Nancy!
1277,THE SEARCH,Now I just begin to see.
1278,THE SEARCH,"Set down, Billy; you are askin'"
1279,THE SEARCH,Something that sure puzzles me.
1280,THE SEARCH,Nancy ain't like other women--
1281,THE SEARCH,"What I say may hit you queer,"
1282,THE SEARCH,But it's jest as well to tell you--
1283,THE SEARCH,That there girl--she isn't here.

1289,THE SEARCH,Slow 'em down and let 'em walk.
1290,THE SEARCH,"Lord a'mighty, man! keep quiet!"
1291,THE SEARCH,Never heard such crazy talk!
1292,THE SEARCH,"Where's the girl? Wal, let me tell you--"
1293,THE SEARCH,T'aint no use to take on so--
1294,THE SEARCH,Where is Nancy? P'r'aps in heaven;
1295,THE SEARCH,"I can't tell yer,--I don't know."
1296,THE SEARCH,"When we left last spring from Kansas,"
1297,THE SEARCH,"Travelin' mostly in the night,"
1298,THE SEARCH,We was chased up by a posse;
1299,THE SEARCH,Fourth day out we had a fight.
1300,THE SEARCH,"We had jest unhitched the hosses,"
1301,THE SEARCH,Making camp at Old Man's Creek--
1302,THE SEARCH,"Gimme some o' that tobacker,"
1303,THE SEARCH,I've been out for more'n a week.
1304,THE SEARCH,
1305,THE SEARCH,
1306,THE SEARCH,30

1308,THE SEARCH,"""We had jest unhitched the hosses,"

1311,THE SEARCH,They had seen us pull in there.
1312,THE SEARCH,"Nancy said,' I'll hold 'em, daddie,"
1313,THE SEARCH,"Get the outfit over here,"
1314,THE SEARCH,And I'll trail you in the mornin';
1315,THE SEARCH,I will see they don't get near.'
1316,THE SEARCH,It was in that heavy timber--
1317,THE SEARCH,Growing dark and spittin' rain--
1318,THE SEARCH,"Where the creek runs to the eastward,"
1319,THE SEARCH,"Makes that loop, and back again."
1320,THE SEARCH,We was in a reg'lar pocket;
1321,THE SEARCH,Creek banks made a kind of bluff
1322,THE SEARCH,"All around us, so it looked like"
1323,THE SEARCH,"We was trapped there, sure enough."
1324,THE SEARCH,
1325,THE SEARCH,
1326,THE SEARCH,31
1327,THE SEARCH,
1328,THE SEARCH,"""Wal, we had a time in movin';"
1329,THE SEARCH,Things got mixed up in the rush;
1330,THE SEARCH,Lead team broke a piece of harness
1331,THE SEARCH,Pulling through the underbrush.
1332,THE SEARCH,"Then the wagon turned clean over,"
1333,THE SEARCH,"But we drug her plumb across,"
1334,THE SEARCH,"Hitched with ropes and other fixin's,"
1335,THE SEARCH,Usin' every extra hoss.
1336,THE SEARCH,"Wal, you never heard such shootin',"
1337,THE SEARCH,Bullets whizzin' everywhere;
1338,THE SEARCH,Pumped 'em on us till it sounded
1339,THE SEARCH,Like they had an army there.
1340,THE SEARCH,"Nancy stayed and cracked it to 'em,"
1341,THE SEARCH,Kind o' circlin' round and round;
1342,THE SEARCH,I could tell the two six-shooters
1343,THE SEARCH,"She was usin', by the sound."

1346,THE SEARCH,32
1347,THE SEARCH,
1348,THE SEARCH,"""You can bet we did some trav'lin'"
1349,THE SEARCH,All that night and all next day;
1350,THE SEARCH,I could still a-hear the shootin'
1351,THE SEARCH,After we was miles away.
1352,THE SEARCH,I supposed we'd see the girl come
1353,THE SEARCH,"Ridin' up to us 'fore long,"
1354,THE SEARCH,That is--I was jest a-thinkin'--
1355,THE SEARCH,If there wasn't somethin' wrong.
1356,THE SEARCH,"But, in spite of all our lookin',"
1357,THE SEARCH,"Sometimes slackin' up our gait,"
1358,THE SEARCH,Always thinkin' we should see her
1359,THE SEARCH,Every time we'd stop and wait.
1360,THE SEARCH,"We have never seen her, Billy,"
1361,THE SEARCH,"And I own I'm balked a bit,"
1362,THE SEARCH,Fur I know that she's a critter

1373,THE SEARCH,"Since I see what's both'rin' you,"
1374,THE SEARCH,'Bout a thing--I hate to ask it--

1376,THE SEARCH,I don't think that girl has ever--
1377,THE SEARCH,"It sure hurts me, what I say--"
1378,THE SEARCH,But I'm sure that in the scrimmage
1379,THE SEARCH,Nancy never got away.
1380,THE SEARCH,"Billy, you go back and find her;"
1381,THE SEARCH,"You are all I've got to send,"
1382,THE SEARCH,"You can sort o' fix things decent,"
1383,THE SEARCH,"Where she is--in Old Man's Bend."""

1392,THE RETURN,
1393,THE RETURN,Every life is but a journey--
1394,THE RETURN,Trav'ling on from place to place--
1395,THE RETURN,Starting from the point God gave us
1396,THE RETURN,With an ever-varying pace.
1397,THE RETURN,"Outward, onward, spurred by motives"
1398,THE RETURN,"In our wand'rings here and there,"
1399,THE RETURN,"Sometimes led by hope alluring,"
1400,THE RETURN,Sometimes halted by despair;
1401,THE RETURN,But the life that travels farthest
1402,THE RETURN,"On that deeper strength depends,"
1403,THE RETURN,"For with love, there is no turning;"
1404,THE RETURN,When love dies the journey ends.
1405,THE RETURN,
1406,THE RETURN,
1407,THE RETURN,2
1408,THE RETURN,
1409,THE RETURN,"Back across the broken foothills,"
1410,THE RETURN,With a courage none can feel
1411,THE RETURN,Till the burning pangs of sorrow
1412,THE RETURN,Turn the heart-strings into steel;
1413,THE RETURN,"Back across the winter's playground,"
1414,THE RETURN,"Tracing out the paths he trod,"
1415,THE RETURN,With each muttered execration
1416,THE RETURN,Ending in a prayer to God.
1417,THE RETURN,"Blasts that howled with fiendish laughter,"
1418,THE RETURN,By their loud derisive cry
1419,THE RETURN,Seemed to mock his labored progress
1420,THE RETURN,As they passed him swiftly by;
1421,THE RETURN,"Icy, blizzard-driven snowflakes"
1422,THE RETURN,"Into ghost-like fancies whirled,"
1423,THE RETURN,"Painting on the barren canvas,"
1424,THE RETURN,Gaunt Death battling for the world.
1425,THE RETURN,
1426,THE RETURN,
1427,THE RETURN,3
1428,THE RETURN,
1429,THE RETURN,"Back across the snow-strewn desert,"
1430,THE RETURN,"Fighting famine face to face,"
1431,THE RETURN,Trusting to his horse to take him
1432,THE RETURN,To each former camping place.
1433,THE RETURN,Once Zeb stopped beside a snowdrift
1434,THE RETURN,With a loud and startling neigh;
1435,THE RETURN,Tried to tell his half-dazed master
1436,THE RETURN,"Where his mate, old Simon, lay."
1437,THE RETURN,"Pressing on, he reached the border"
1438,THE RETURN,"Of Nebraska's whitened plain,"
1439,THE RETURN,Where his mind in maudlin fancies
1440,THE RETURN,"Yielded to the bitter strain,"
1441,THE RETURN,"As he saw far in the distance,"
1442,THE RETURN,"Like a battered mast at sea,"
1443,THE RETURN,Once again the twisted branches
1444,THE RETURN,Of the lone and friendly tree.

1452,THE RETURN,"""Git up, Zeb. Come, see! She's waving!"
1453,THE RETURN,Waving there for you and me.
1454,THE RETURN,"See her there, so white and pretty,"
1455,THE RETURN,"Standing by our friend, the tree!"
1456,THE RETURN,"Quit that stumbling! Now then, streak it!"
1457,THE RETURN,Hit the gait you used to do
1458,THE RETURN,When we hired out for the round up
1459,THE RETURN,And you beat the first one through.
1460,THE RETURN,There she is! There's where I saw her
1461,THE RETURN,When we stayed there all that night;
1462,THE RETURN,"Though 'twas dark, I saw her riding,"
1463,THE RETURN,By those flashing threads of light;
1464,THE RETURN,"She's been waiting! Oh, I left her"
1465,THE RETURN,In this awful lonely place!
1466,THE RETURN,God forgive me! Nancy! hear me!

1471,THE RETURN,
1472,THE RETURN,"One cold morning, old Zach Baxter,"
1473,THE RETURN,Riding o'er this snowbound sea
1474,THE RETURN,Saw a famished pony standing
1475,THE RETURN,Near a queer and lonely tree.
1476,THE RETURN,From his frost-encrusted nostrils
1477,THE RETURN,"Came a plaintive whinny, low,"
1478,THE RETURN,As the man rode up beside him
1479,THE RETURN,Struggling through the drifted snow.
1480,THE RETURN,"When the old man tried to lead him,"
1481,THE RETURN,He refused to turn away;
1482,THE RETURN,"But he pawed the drift beneath him,"
1483,THE RETURN,Where his stricken master lay.
1484,THE RETURN,"And below the cold, white cover,"
1485,THE RETURN,"In a deathlike stupor deep,"
1486,THE RETURN,Old Zach found a sorry stranger
1487,THE RETURN,Shrouded for his last long sleep.
1488,THE RETURN,
1489,THE RETURN,
1490,THE RETURN,6
1491,THE RETURN,
1492,THE RETURN,Tearing at the ragged bundle
1493,THE RETURN,"Lodged between the horse's feet,"
1494,THE RETURN,"Clutching at the frozen blanket,"
1495,THE RETURN,"Brushing back the crusted sleet,"
1496,THE RETURN,"Faithful in his rude endeavors,"
1497,THE RETURN,"Rousing by his loud commands,"
1498,THE RETURN,"Roughly shaking, turning, rubbing,"
1499,THE RETURN,Zach breathed on his face and hands;
1500,THE RETURN,Till the stiffened limbs responded
1501,THE RETURN,"And the closed eyes opened wide,"
1502,THE RETURN,Dazed and puzzled at the stranger
1503,THE RETURN,Working fiercely at his side.
1504,THE RETURN,"Billy felt the strong arms raise him,"
1505,THE RETURN,Felt the Frost King's stinging breath
1506,THE RETURN,"As he struggled, half unconscious,"
1507,THE RETURN,In the wav'ring fight with death.
1508,THE RETURN,
1509,THE RETURN,
1510,THE RETURN,7
1511,THE RETURN,
1512,THE RETURN,"In the east, the sun dogs glistened"
1513,THE RETURN,"Like tall shafts of marble, bright,"
1514,THE RETURN,"O'er the whitened grave of nature,--"
1515,THE RETURN,"Ghostly spires of frozen light,"
1516,THE RETURN,"Flying frost flakes snapping, sparkling,"
1517,THE RETURN,"Dancing in a wild display,"
1518,THE RETURN,Turned into a mist of diamonds
1519,THE RETURN,As they mocked the newborn day.
1520,THE RETURN,
1521,THE RETURN,
1522,THE RETURN,8
1523,THE RETURN,
1524,THE RETURN,"Old Zach's pony bearing double,"
1525,THE RETURN,"Reeking steam from every pore,"
1526,THE RETURN,Reached at last the covered pathway
1527,THE RETURN,Leading to the dug-out door.
1528,THE RETURN,"With his arms clasped tight round Billy,"
1529,THE RETURN,Zach half dragged his helpless load
1530,THE RETURN,"Through the lowly, mud-walled entrance"
1531,THE RETURN,Of his rudely built abode.
1532,THE RETURN,"There, upon the narrow bunk bed"
1533,THE RETURN,"Spread with nondescript attire,"
1534,THE RETURN,Zach enfolded him in wrappings
1535,THE RETURN,While he started up a fire;
1536,THE RETURN,"And no nurse, however skillful,"
1537,THE RETURN,"Whatsoever her degree,"
1538,THE RETURN,Ever gave more loyal service
1539,THE RETURN,"To a patient, than did he."
1540,THE RETURN,
1541,THE RETURN,
1542,THE RETURN,9
1543,THE RETURN,
1544,THE RETURN,Poor and meager were the comforts
1545,THE RETURN,"Of Zach's cave-like prairie home,"
1546,THE RETURN,Permeated with the odor
1547,THE RETURN,Of the fresh-dug virgin loam.
1548,THE RETURN,"Pungent wreaths of smoke, slow drifting,"
1549,THE RETURN,"Floated lazily above,"
1550,THE RETURN,To the dried grass of the ceiling
1551,THE RETURN,From the cracked and rusty stove.
1552,THE RETURN,Willow poles athwart for rafters
1553,THE RETURN,"Sagged beneath the dirt roof's strain,"
1554,THE RETURN,And a piece of grease-smeared paper
1555,THE RETURN,Formed the only window-pane.
1556,THE RETURN,"In the center, on the dirt floor"
1557,THE RETURN,Stood a table-like affair
1558,THE RETURN,"Fashioned from a wagon end-gate,"
1559,THE RETURN,Where Zach spread his scanty fare.
1560,THE RETURN,
1561,THE RETURN,
1562,THE RETURN,10
1563,THE RETURN,
1564,THE RETURN,"There for weeks lay Billy, helpless,"
1565,THE RETURN,"Racked with mad'ning fever pains,"
1566,THE RETURN,As the burning sun of summer
1567,THE RETURN,Scorches sere the desert plains.
1568,THE RETURN,"Then he lay with cold, white features"
1569,THE RETURN,"And the feeble, scarce drawn breath,"
1570,THE RETURN,As the silent winter prairie
1571,THE RETURN,Lies beneath its shroud of death.
1572,THE RETURN,Ofttimes when the raging sickness
1573,THE RETURN,"Sent the hot blood to his brain,"
1574,THE RETURN,He would point with frantic gesture
1575,THE RETURN,"To the dingy window pane,"
1576,THE RETURN,"Calling in excited mutterings,"
1577,THE RETURN,Eyes transfixed in frenzied fright--
1578,THE RETURN,"""There she is! Now, can't you see her?"
1579,THE RETURN,"See her face there in the light!"""
1580,THE RETURN,
1581,THE RETURN,
1582,THE RETURN,11
1583,THE RETURN,
1584,THE RETURN,Then old Zach would try to soothe him
1585,THE RETURN,In his simple-hearted way;
1586,THE RETURN,"""She won't hurt you,"" he would tell him,"
1587,THE RETURN,"""I'll go drive her clear away."
1588,THE RETURN,"I've seen things--now listen, pardner--"
1589,THE RETURN,Those things happened once to me
1590,THE RETURN,"Once down there in old Dodge City,"
1591,THE RETURN,Winding up a three weeks' spree.
1592,THE RETURN,"What you see is jest a 'lusion,"
1593,THE RETURN,'Cause you're crazy in your head;
1594,THE RETURN,When your thinker's runnin' proper
1595,THE RETURN,You'll find 'She' is gone or dead.
1596,THE RETURN,"There, now, pardner, see what this is!"
1597,THE RETURN,Ain't it purty? Your tin cup;
1598,THE RETURN,Found a little pinch o' coffee.
1599,THE RETURN,"That's the boy, now, drink it up!"""
1600,THE RETURN,
1601,THE RETURN,
1602,THE RETURN,12
1603,THE RETURN,
1604,THE RETURN,When the breeze of spring in whispers
1605,THE RETURN,"Stirred the withered bunch-grass plume,"
1606,THE RETURN,Humming hymns of resurrection
1607,THE RETURN,"Over nature's silent tomb,"
1608,THE RETURN,"And the fleeing clouds of heaven,"
1609,THE RETURN,"Bending low at God's command,"
1610,THE RETURN,Spilled their tribute from the ocean
1611,THE RETURN,"On the long-forsaken land,"
1612,THE RETURN,"And the sun, with mellow kindness"
1613,THE RETURN,"Spread abroad his softened rays,"
1614,THE RETURN,Calling bud and blade and blossom
1615,THE RETURN,"From their sleep of many days,"
1616,THE RETURN,"Billy heard, at last, the music"
1617,THE RETURN,"Of the glad earth's jubilee,"
1618,THE RETURN,"Felt a new strength stir within him,"
1619,THE RETURN,And a longing to be free.
1620,THE RETURN,
1621,THE RETURN,
1622,THE RETURN,13
1623,THE RETURN,
1624,THE RETURN,"One day, o'er the hill's low summit,"
1625,THE RETURN,"Whence the prairie dipped away,"
1626,THE RETURN,There appeared a moving wagon
1627,THE RETURN,"With its canvas patched and gray,"
1628,THE RETURN,Like a vessel on the ocean
1629,THE RETURN,"Under taut and close-reefed sail,"
1630,THE RETURN,Rising slowly on the billows
1631,THE RETURN,Heaped up by the driving gale.
1632,THE RETURN,"Veering towards the little dug-out,"
1633,THE RETURN,"Making for a friendly shore,"
1634,THE RETURN,"Heaving to, the schooner anchored"
1635,THE RETURN,Close beside the open door.
1636,THE RETURN,"Loud and hearty were the greetings,"
1637,THE RETURN,For the driver of the team
1638,THE RETURN,"Was Tom Frothingham, a neighbor,"
1639,THE RETURN,Who had lived near Billy's claim.
1640,THE RETURN,
1641,THE RETURN,
1642,THE RETURN,14
1643,THE RETURN,
1644,THE RETURN,Bit by bit he told the story--
1645,THE RETURN,How he'd wandered all around
1646,THE RETURN,Since he left his Kansas homestead
1647,THE RETURN,And the folks near North Pole mound;
1648,THE RETURN,How he'd traveled all through Texas
1649,THE RETURN,"With the roving fever on,"
1650,THE RETURN,"Camping oft in strange new places,"
1651,THE RETURN,Where no other soul had gone.
1652,THE RETURN,"So the news, now half forgotten"
1653,THE RETURN,"In his absence from the place,"
1654,THE RETURN,Came in broken recollections--
1655,THE RETURN,Careful efforts to retrace
1656,THE RETURN,All the incidents of interest
1657,THE RETURN,"To the sick one listening there,"
1658,THE RETURN,"Who, with pale and careworn features,"
1659,THE RETURN,Heard the story with despair.
1660,THE RETURN,
1661,THE RETURN,
1662,THE RETURN,15
1663,THE RETURN,
1664,THE RETURN,"""Three weeks after you left Kansas"
1665,THE RETURN,I hitched up and came away.
1666,THE RETURN,"Still, I reckoned you intended"
1667,THE RETURN,To improve your claim and stay;
1668,THE RETURN,For your eighty was a picture--
1669,THE RETURN,Running spring and good clear land--
1670,THE RETURN,Everything a body needed
1671,THE RETURN,"For a starter, right at hand."
1672,THE RETURN,"Well, some others left 'fore I did--"
1673,THE RETURN,"You remember Mac, of course,"
1674,THE RETURN,How he got the moving notion
1675,THE RETURN,When Bill Kelly missed his horse?
1676,THE RETURN,"Chased him clear to Old Man's crossing,"
1677,THE RETURN,So I heard the posse say;
1678,THE RETURN,"Thought they had him fairly cornered,"
1679,THE RETURN,"But, by jings! he got away."
1680,THE RETURN,
1681,THE RETURN,
1682,THE RETURN,16
1683,THE RETURN,
1684,THE RETURN,"""There are stranger things than fiction;"
1685,THE RETURN,"What is natural may seem queer,"
1686,THE RETURN,So I s'pose we needn't wonder
1687,THE RETURN,At the things we see out here.
1688,THE RETURN,One thing happened since you left there
1689,THE RETURN,That I call a burning shame--
1690,THE RETURN,Did you know that rope-necked Johnson
1691,THE RETURN,Jumped your eighty-acre claim?
1692,THE RETURN,"Last I saw him, he was plowing,"
1693,THE RETURN,And he laughed and tried to joke:
1694,THE RETURN,Said 'twas kind of you to leave him
1695,THE RETURN,All the ground that you had broke;
1696,THE RETURN,Said your house was so untidy
1697,THE RETURN,"He was sleeping out of doors,"
1698,THE RETURN,Till he got a girl to help him
1699,THE RETURN,Wash the pans and scrub the floors.
1700,THE RETURN,
1701,THE RETURN,
1702,THE RETURN,17
1703,THE RETURN,
1704,THE RETURN,"""Lots of people coming in there"
1705,THE RETURN,From most every foreign land--
1706,THE RETURN,Massachusetts and Missouri--
1707,THE RETURN,Made a mess I couldn't stand.
1708,THE RETURN,Every man that's made of manhood
1709,THE RETURN,"Wants to live where he is free,"
1710,THE RETURN,So I'm bound to keep on moving
1711,THE RETURN,When they get to crowding me.
1712,THE RETURN,Then another thing that happened:
1713,THE RETURN,Puzzled every one around
1714,THE RETURN,"When they heard one morning early,"
1715,THE RETURN,That Bill Kelly's horse was found.
1716,THE RETURN,Aleck Rose told me about it
1717,THE RETURN,After I had packed and gone;
1718,THE RETURN,Said the mare strayed in the dooryard
1719,THE RETURN,"With Mac's steel-horn saddle on."""
1720,THE RETURN,
1721,THE RETURN,
1722,THE RETURN,18
1723,THE RETURN,
1724,THE RETURN,As each day in steady conquest
1725,THE RETURN,"Charged the ranks of fleeing night,"
1726,THE RETURN,Winning back the stolen hours
1727,THE RETURN,With their golden spears of light;
1728,THE RETURN,As the living in all nature
1729,THE RETURN,"Felt that mighty spirit's sway,"
1730,THE RETURN,So the sick man caught the power
1731,THE RETURN,And his illness wore away.
1732,THE RETURN,"One clear morning, as Aurora"
1733,THE RETURN,"Silver-tinted all the plain,"
1734,THE RETURN,In his weatherbeaten saddle
1735,THE RETURN,Billy took the trail again.
1736,THE RETURN,"""Good by, boy,"" old Zach repeated,"
1737,THE RETURN,"""I'm most sure you'll never see"
1738,THE RETURN,"Any more o' them 'ere 'lusions,"
1739,THE RETURN,"Anyway, what you called 'She.'"""
1740,THE RETURN,
1741,THE RETURN,
1742,THE RETURN,19
1743,THE RETURN,
1744,THE RETURN,Day by day the low horizon
1745,THE RETURN,"Spread its narrow circle round,"
1746,THE RETURN,"As if fate had drawn a barrier,"
1747,THE RETURN,And forbade advance beyond.
1748,THE RETURN,"Though the journey dragged on slowly,"
1749,THE RETURN,"Night time brought its sure reward,"
1750,THE RETURN,For the added miles behind him
1751,THE RETURN,"Stretched at length to Mingo's Ford,"
1752,THE RETURN,Where the breeze bore from the upland
1753,THE RETURN,Broken fragments of the song
1754,THE RETURN,"Of the cowboy with his cattle,"
1755,THE RETURN,As he drove the strays along;
1756,THE RETURN,Where the voice of flowing water
1757,THE RETURN,"And the treble of the birds,"
1758,THE RETURN,Swelled the hallowed evening anthem
1759,THE RETURN,To the bass of lowing herds.
1760,THE RETURN,
1761,THE RETURN,
1762,THE RETURN,20
1763,THE RETURN,
1764,THE RETURN,Then the trail along the Solomon
1765,THE RETURN,"Where the timber, making friends"
1766,THE RETURN,"With the ever-widening valley,"
1767,THE RETURN,Filled the rounded river bends;
1768,THE RETURN,"Then the rankling recollection,"
1769,THE RETURN,As he passed some well-known place
1770,THE RETURN,"Where before, with hope and vigor,"
1771,THE RETURN,He had sped in fruitless chase.
1772,THE RETURN,"Then the lonely camp at nightfall,"
1773,THE RETURN,Where the wind in monotone
1774,THE RETURN,"Thrummed the harp strings of the grass stems,"
1775,THE RETURN,"Breathing low its song, ""Alone!"""
1776,THE RETURN,"Where the stars, fixed in the heavens,"
1777,THE RETURN,"To his upturned face would say,"
1778,THE RETURN,"With their heartless glint of distance,"
1779,THE RETURN,"""She thou seek'st is far away."""
1780,THE RETURN,
1781,THE RETURN,
1782,THE RETURN,21
1783,THE RETURN,
1784,THE RETURN,"Then the long, far-reaching bottoms"
1785,THE RETURN,"Rank with withered blue-joint grass,"
1786,THE RETURN,With its broken stems entangled
1787,THE RETURN,In a matted jungle mass;
1788,THE RETURN,"Then across the higher prairie,"
1789,THE RETURN,"Searching out a shorter way,"
1790,THE RETURN,To the creek that joined the river
1791,THE RETURN,Where Mac crossed and got away;
1792,THE RETURN,Then the twinge of bitter sorrow
1793,THE RETURN,"As he neared his journey's end,"
1794,THE RETURN,And beheld the fringe of timber
1795,THE RETURN,"On the banks of Old Man's bend,"
1796,THE RETURN,Where no living sign or token
1797,THE RETURN,"Broke the gloom that brooded there,"
1798,THE RETURN,Save a solitary buzzard
1799,THE RETURN,Floating idly in the air.
1800,THE RETURN,
1801,THE RETURN,
1802,THE RETURN,22
1803,THE RETURN,
1804,THE RETURN,From these high and broken hilltops
1805,THE RETURN,"He could trace the river's flow,"
1806,THE RETURN,"And the creek's untamed meandering,"
1807,THE RETURN,"With its looplike bend below,"
1808,THE RETURN,Seeming in the light of evening
1809,THE RETURN,"Like a giant serpent there,"
1810,THE RETURN,"Which had coiled about its victim,"
1811,THE RETURN,And lay resting in its lair.
1812,THE RETURN,Breaking through the tangled brushwood
1813,THE RETURN,"As the night was coming on,"
1814,THE RETURN,Creeping down the steep embankment
1815,THE RETURN,"Where the muddy waters run,"
1816,THE RETURN,Billy crossed within the timber
1817,THE RETURN,"Where the shroud of deeper gloom,"
1818,THE RETURN,And its chilling breath of darkness
1819,THE RETURN,Marked the hidden prairie tomb.
1820,THE RETURN,
1821,THE RETURN,
1822,THE RETURN,23
1823,THE RETURN,
1824,THE RETURN,"As the soul in deep communion,"
1825,THE RETURN,Seeks some isolated bower
1826,THE RETURN,Where the body's sordid cravings
1827,THE RETURN,"Yield beneath the spirit's power,"
1828,THE RETURN,"So the searcher, bowed in reverence,"
1829,THE RETURN,Left untouched his evening fare
1830,THE RETURN,As he listened to the voices
1831,THE RETURN,Of the shadows gathering there.
1832,THE RETURN,Here no lighted torch or camp fire
1833,THE RETURN,"With its weak and fitful ray,"
1834,THE RETURN,Could illume the mystic journey
1835,THE RETURN,Of prayer's consecrated way.
1836,THE RETURN,Here the silence brought its message
1837,THE RETURN,"Of forebodings, vague and deep,"
1838,THE RETURN,"In its visions to the dreamer,"
1839,THE RETURN,Through the mystery of sleep.
1840,THE RETURN,
1841,THE RETURN,
1842,THE RETURN,24
1843,THE RETURN,
1844,THE RETURN,In his dreams he saw a monarch
1845,THE RETURN,"Decked in sumptuous array,"
1846,THE RETURN,"Seated on a throne of glory,"
1847,THE RETURN,"Bearing royal title, Day."
1848,THE RETURN,"Then some mighty power transcendent,"
1849,THE RETURN,"Thrust him from his gorgeous throne,"
1850,THE RETURN,"Turning all the realm to darkness,"
1851,THE RETURN,And the world was left alone.
1852,THE RETURN,"As the shades of gloom were spreading,"
1853,THE RETURN,By strange flashing threads of light
1854,THE RETURN,"He beheld in dim-drawn outline,"
1855,THE RETURN,"On the background of the night,"
1856,THE RETURN,"Phantom horse and girlish rider,"
1857,THE RETURN,"Speeding on in reckless race,"
1858,THE RETURN,Till she turned directly toward him
1859,THE RETURN,And he saw her fearless face.
1860,THE RETURN,
1861,THE RETURN,
1862,THE RETURN,25
1863,THE RETURN,
1864,THE RETURN,"Then, behold! the King returning"
1865,THE RETURN,"With a pageantry so bright,"
1866,THE RETURN,That the shadow-clad usurpers
1867,THE RETURN,Fled in ignominious fright.
1868,THE RETURN,As he saw the hosts approaching
1869,THE RETURN,"Through a cloud of battle smoke,"
1870,THE RETURN,"Charging wildly down upon him,"
1871,THE RETURN,"He, in sudden fear, awoke."
1872,THE RETURN,"As he looked, the blackened heavens"
1873,THE RETURN,Splashed with demon-tinted blood
1874,THE RETURN,From the hue of burning prairie
1875,THE RETURN,Throbbed above the fiery flood.
1876,THE RETURN,"Leaping o'er the rounded bluff-tops,"
1877,THE RETURN,"Down the valley's long incline,"
1878,THE RETURN,He could see the lurid column
1879,THE RETURN,Spread its blazing battle line.
1880,THE RETURN,
1881,THE RETURN,
1882,THE RETURN,26
1883,THE RETURN,
1884,THE RETURN,Like a troop of charging horsemen
1885,THE RETURN,"Sweeping on with maddened roar,"
1886,THE RETURN,"Mowing down the grass battalions,"
1887,THE RETURN,Crackling flames swept all before.
1888,THE RETURN,"Then the driftwood's rifted breastwork,"
1889,THE RETURN,"Left there by the waters high,"
1890,THE RETURN,"Flashed up in a hissing furnace,"
1891,THE RETURN,As the red-armed fiends leaped by.
1892,THE RETURN,Clinging to the swaying saddle
1893,THE RETURN,"And the plunging horse's mane,"
1894,THE RETURN,Billy dashed through falling embers
1895,THE RETURN,"To the level, open plain."
1896,THE RETURN,"On the right and left, the head fires"
1897,THE RETURN,"Rushing on at furious pace,"
1898,THE RETURN,Stretched beside the horse and rider
1899,THE RETURN,In the life-and-death-fought race.
1900,THE RETURN,
1901,THE RETURN,
1902,THE RETURN,27
1903,THE RETURN,
1904,THE RETURN,Here the gale with venomed fury
1905,THE RETURN,"Met in vortex from afar,"
1906,THE RETURN,Raising high the flaming pennons
1907,THE RETURN,Of the fiery fiends of war.
1908,THE RETURN,"Flashing by, the blazing grass stems"
1909,THE RETURN,"Sped like arrows through the air,"
1910,THE RETURN,"Falling on the distant prairie,"
1911,THE RETURN,Kindling fresh fires everywhere.
1912,THE RETURN,Pressing through the low-flung smoke clouds--
1913,THE RETURN,Stifling fumes of Hades' breath--
1914,THE RETURN,Fiercer with each flying moment
1915,THE RETURN,Drove those scorching blasts of death.
1916,THE RETURN,"Thrice his horse, 'neath quirt and rowel"
1917,THE RETURN,"Bravely struggling, almost fell,"
1918,THE RETURN,As he fled in desperation
1919,THE RETURN,O'er the trail that led through hell.
1920,THE RETURN,
1921,THE RETURN,
1922,THE RETURN,28
1923,THE RETURN,
1924,THE RETURN,One poor singed and panting coyote
1925,THE RETURN,Through the perils of the ride
1926,THE RETURN,Hemmed in by the flames pursuing
1927,THE RETURN,Ran close by the horse's side.
1928,THE RETURN,"Scarce a meager pace behind them,"
1929,THE RETURN,"Pressing hard the coyote's rear,"
1930,THE RETURN,"Raced a frantic old jack rabbit,"
1931,THE RETURN,Ears laid low in speed and fear.
1932,THE RETURN,"Reaching now a stretch of upland,"
1933,THE RETURN,"Here the coyote changed his course,"
1934,THE RETURN,"Breaking through the narrow side-fire,"
1935,THE RETURN,Followed fast by hare and horse;
1936,THE RETURN,"And, upon the smoking prairie"
1937,THE RETURN,"Over which the fire had passed,"
1938,THE RETURN,Steaming horse and stricken rider
1939,THE RETURN,Found a breathing space at last.
1940,THE RETURN,
1941,THE RETURN,"[Illustration: ""Fiercer with each flying moment"
1942,THE RETURN,"Drove those scorching blasts of death.""]"
1943,THE RETURN,
1944,THE RETURN,
1945,THE RETURN,29
1946,THE RETURN,
1947,THE RETURN,When the morning sun in splendor
1948,THE RETURN,"Rose upon the blackened plain,"
1949,THE RETURN,His red beams revealed the lover
1950,THE RETURN,Back at Old Man's Bend again.
1951,THE RETURN,Waist deep in its soothing waters
1952,THE RETURN,Bathing blistered brow and hands;
1953,THE RETURN,"While near by, in pain a-tremble,"
1954,THE RETURN,Faithful Zeb impatient stands.
1955,THE RETURN,"Through the bend he searched and wandered,"
1956,THE RETURN,"But except the furrowed bark,"
1957,THE RETURN,Of a gnarled and aged elm tree
1958,THE RETURN,"Which revealed one bullet-mark,"
1959,THE RETURN,Naught was left save blackened embers;
1960,THE RETURN,"And the words he ""knew in part""--"
1961,THE RETURN,"""Dust to dust and then to ashes""--"
1962,THE RETURN,Told the story of his heart.
1963,THE RETURN,
1964,THE RETURN,
1965,THE RETURN,30
1966,THE RETURN,
1967,THE RETURN,"Back along the Solomon River,"
1968,THE RETURN,Trailing towards the humble claim
1969,THE RETURN,He had lost when love and duty
1970,THE RETURN,"Fired his soul to ""being game"";"
1971,THE RETURN,"Back, across the beaver fordway,"
1972,THE RETURN,"Where love first had found the track,"
1973,THE RETURN,Now returning with the rankling
1974,THE RETURN,Sting of hate to bring him back--
1975,THE RETURN,"Hate, that hunger made more bitter"
1976,THE RETURN,When his last jerked beef was gone;
1977,THE RETURN,Climbing trees to cut off branches
1978,THE RETURN,For his horse to browse upon;
1979,THE RETURN,"Back, where once the flower-decked prairie,"
1980,THE RETURN,"Spread its bloom of hope and bliss,"
1981,THE RETURN,"Now a blackened field of mourning,"
1982,THE RETURN,From the fire of one sweet kiss.
1983,THE RETURN,
1984,THE RETURN,
1985,THE RETURN,31
1986,THE RETURN,
1987,THE RETURN,"Till one day, he saw beyond him,"
1988,THE RETURN,"In the distance, purple crowned,"
1989,THE RETURN,"That old monarch of the prairie,"
1990,THE RETURN,"Guard of ages, North Pole Mound."
1991,THE RETURN,Then the field where Zeb and Simon
1992,THE RETURN,Pulled the old sod-breaking plow
1993,THE RETURN,Stretching like a narrow ribbon
1994,THE RETURN,On the land that lay below.
1995,THE RETURN,Now the horse's steps grew lighter
1996,THE RETURN,As he passed each well-known sign
1997,THE RETURN,"Of the old familiar landscape,"
1998,THE RETURN,"And they crossed the eighty's line,"
1999,THE RETURN,Where the spring of running waters
2000,THE RETURN,"Gave envenomed purpose birth,"
2001,THE RETURN,As he drank its bubbling offering
2002,THE RETURN,From the pulsing heart of earth.
2003,THE RETURN,
2004,THE RETURN,
2005,THE RETURN,32
2006,THE RETURN,
2007,THE RETURN,"Then, ascending from the hollow,"
2008,THE RETURN,Full before his eyes appeared
2009,THE RETURN,Home--his home--the low-walled sodhouse
2010,THE RETURN,Which his toiling hands had reared.
2011,THE RETURN,Near the straw shed stood the wagon
2012,THE RETURN,"He had brought from Wichita,"
2013,THE RETURN,And beneath the grass-fringed gable
2014,THE RETURN,Hung his trusty crosscut saw.
2015,THE RETURN,"In the dooryard, near the window,"
2016,THE RETURN,"Lay the broken homemade chair,"
2017,THE RETURN,"Where, at evening, love-born fancies"
2018,THE RETURN,"Revelled, as he rested there;"
2019,THE RETURN,"Love, whose scattered seed had fallen"
2020,THE RETURN,"On a mystic field of fate,"
2021,THE RETURN,Where the tangled vine extending
2022,THE RETURN,Bore the bitter fruit of hate.
2023,THE RETURN,
2024,THE RETURN,
2025,THE RETURN,33
2026,THE RETURN,
2027,THE RETURN,"Hurrying nearer, he dismounted,"
2028,THE RETURN,"Trembling with the rage he felt,"
2029,THE RETURN,As he cast aside the bridle
2030,THE RETURN,And drew taut his cartridge belt.
2031,THE RETURN,"Throwing down his torn sombrero,"
2032,THE RETURN,"There, before the tight-closed door,"
2033,THE RETURN,On the cowardly usurper
2034,THE RETURN,Loud and bitter vengeance swore.
2035,THE RETURN,"""Come, you dirty, green-scummed scoundrel,"
2036,THE RETURN,With your sneaking 'plan or two'!
2037,THE RETURN,"Just come out, you rope-necked buzzard!"
2038,THE RETURN,See how far you'll put them through.
2039,THE RETURN,"You can keep the eighty acres,"
2040,THE RETURN,"Hell will write your pedigree,"
2041,THE RETURN,But I'll rub your crooked nose-piece
2042,THE RETURN,In the dirt you stole from me.
2043,THE RETURN,
2044,THE RETURN,
2045,THE RETURN,34
2046,THE RETURN,
2047,THE RETURN,"""Come outside, you sneaking coyote!"
2048,THE RETURN,If you've got a drop of man
2049,THE RETURN,"In your greasy, thieving carcass,"
2050,THE RETURN,"Finish up what you began."""
2051,THE RETURN,"Fiercer grew his coarse invective,"
2052,THE RETURN,"Louder yet his taunting calls,"
2053,THE RETURN,When no answer to his challenge
2054,THE RETURN,Came from out the low sod walls.
2055,THE RETURN,"Uncontrolled, his furious anger"
2056,THE RETURN,Spoke in quick and murderous roar
2057,THE RETURN,As he pumped his old six-shooter
2058,THE RETURN,Through the barred and bolted door.
2059,THE RETURN,"When he paused the rude door opened,"
2060,THE RETURN,And before its splintered place
2061,THE RETURN,"Stood the vision of the shadows,"
2062,THE RETURN,And he saw Her fearless face.
2063,THE RETURN,
2064,THE RETURN,
2065,THE RETURN,35
2066,THE RETURN,
2067,THE RETURN,As the artist in his painting
2068,THE RETURN,Plans the background to enhance
2069,THE RETURN,All the beauty of his subject
2070,THE RETURN,"Both in pose and countenance,"
2071,THE RETURN,So the poor and dark interior
2072,THE RETURN,Lent its gloom to magnify
2073,THE RETURN,All the power and witching beauty
2074,THE RETURN,Of her face and lustrous eye.
2075,THE RETURN,"Standing there, a pictured goddess"
2076,THE RETURN,"Sketched against a lowering storm,"
2077,THE RETURN,Bearing on her pallid features
2078,THE RETURN,That supernal gift of calm.
2079,THE RETURN,
2080,THE RETURN,
2081,THE RETURN,36
2082,THE RETURN,
2083,THE RETURN,"""Nancy! Woman! God in heaven,"
2084,THE RETURN,"Speak, girl! Can this thing be true?"
2085,THE RETURN,"Are you here with that--that scoundrel,"
2086,THE RETURN,After all that I've gone through?
2087,THE RETURN,"Do you stand there, fiend or human,"
2088,THE RETURN,"After lending him your hand,"
2089,THE RETURN,"First to break an honest spirit,"
2090,THE RETURN,Then to steal away my land?
2091,THE RETURN,Must a man who loves a woman
2092,THE RETURN,Like a devil's imp be driven
2093,THE RETURN,Through the tortures of damnation
2094,THE RETURN,For a single glimpse of heaven?
2095,THE RETURN,Tell me where the cur is hiding--
2096,THE RETURN,"I've no wish to hurt his bride,"
2097,THE RETURN,But I'll braid a twelve-foot bull whip
2098,THE RETURN,"From his dirty, yaller hide!"
2099,THE RETURN,
2100,THE RETURN,
2101,THE RETURN,37
2102,THE RETURN,
2103,THE RETURN,"""Speak to me and tell me, woman,"
2104,THE RETURN,How the God in heaven above
2105,THE RETURN,Starts the fires of hell a-burning
2106,THE RETURN,From a spark of human love;
2107,THE RETURN,Why He ever made a woman
2108,THE RETURN,Who could play a fickle part;
2109,THE RETURN,Why He ever made a fellow
2110,THE RETURN,With his soul tied to his heart;
2111,THE RETURN,Why He made life just a gamble--
2112,THE RETURN,I can't talk the way I feel--
2113,THE RETURN,"In the game that I've been playing,"
2114,THE RETURN,You know this ain't no square deal!
2115,THE RETURN,"I will go away and leave you,"
2116,THE RETURN,But 'twould kind o' ease the pain
2117,THE RETURN,"If you'd only tell me, Nancy--"
2118,THE RETURN,If you'd try--to--just explain.

2127,THE RETURN,With a face of livid white
2128,THE RETURN,Like the specter of the prairie
2129,THE RETURN,"That I saw one horrid night,"
2130,THE RETURN,Riding through the endless darkness
2131,THE RETURN,Like a being doomed from birth
2132,THE RETURN,Just to roam outside of heaven
2133,THE RETURN,And denied a place on earth.
2134,THE RETURN,"Say one word to me! Speak, Nancy,"
2135,THE RETURN,If you have a voice and live!
2136,THE RETURN,"Tell the worst, e'en though you ask me"
2137,THE RETURN,To be patient and forgive.
2138,THE RETURN,I will listen--I will suffer--
2139,THE RETURN,I will do the best I can;
2140,THE RETURN,"Nancy, sweetheart! hear the pleading"
2141,THE RETURN,"Of a broken-hearted man,"""

2144,THE RETURN,39
2145,THE RETURN,
2146,THE RETURN,"""See here, Billy! You gone crazy?"
2147,THE RETURN,Charging like you got a fit?
2148,THE RETURN,Johnson ain't in--just at present--
2149,THE RETURN,Won't you stop and rest a bit?
2150,THE RETURN,"Don't act strange. There's no hard feelings,"
2151,THE RETURN,Though I've never seen before
2152,THE RETURN,Any man that knocked like you did
2153,THE RETURN,On a peaceful neighbor's door.
2154,THE RETURN,"Come right in; now, don't be backward,"
2155,THE RETURN,Like old times to have _you_ 'round!
2156,THE RETURN,"You look tired, like you'd traveled"
2157,THE RETURN,Over quite a stretch of ground.
2158,THE RETURN,Sit right here in this old rocker;
2159,THE RETURN,"Johnson fixed it up one day,"
2160,THE RETURN,Feeling certain you would never
2161,THE RETURN,Come meandering 'round this way.
2162,THE RETURN,

2164,THE RETURN,40
2165,THE RETURN,
2166,THE RETURN,"""Don't get up and act uneasy,"
2167,THE RETURN,"Rest yourself, now, if you can,"
2168,THE RETURN,You don't mind me like Jim Johnson--
2169,THE RETURN,He's a most obedient man.
2170,THE RETURN,"You went off and left your eighty,"
2171,THE RETURN,"Roaming where the luck-wind blows,"
2172,THE RETURN,"Like a tumbleweed in winter,"
2173,THE RETURN,"Where you've been, Lord only knows."
2174,THE RETURN,"While Jim's gone we'll talk together,"
2175,THE RETURN,"As we used to, months ago,"
2176,THE RETURN,When I tried to quench the burning
2177,THE RETURN,Of a love I didn't know.
2178,THE RETURN,"Listen, Billy, while I tell you"
2179,THE RETURN,All about my 'fickle part';
2180,THE RETURN,When I'm done you may know better
2181,THE RETURN,How God made a woman's heart.

2184,THE RETURN,41
2185,THE RETURN,
2186,THE RETURN,"""While you're resting, I'll get supper,"

2188,THE RETURN,"'Cepting bran, to make some muffins,"
2189,THE RETURN,And a little rabbit meat.
2190,THE RETURN,Wish I had that pinch of coffee
2191,THE RETURN,"I saved up for--oh, so long,"
2192,THE RETURN,"Till one day I went and used it,"
2193,THE RETURN,Though I somehow felt 'twas wrong;
2194,THE RETURN,For I kind o' thought that sometime
2195,THE RETURN,Some one might be coming here
2196,THE RETURN,"Worn out with a long, long journey,"

2198,THE RETURN,"Now, then, Billy, draw your stool up;"

2316,NANCY'S STORY,And the light that shone within
2317,NANCY'S STORY,Seemed to twist his wrinkled features
2318,NANCY'S STORY,In a sort of wonder-grin.
2319,NANCY'S STORY,'Well! well! Nancy! sure's I'm livin'!
2320,NANCY'S STORY,Out there in the pouring wet!
2321,NANCY'S STORY,"Sure I'll care for you, Miss Nancy,"
2322,NANCY'S STORY,"I'll protect you, don't you fret!"
2323,NANCY'S STORY,"I'm a friend that you can count on,"
2324,NANCY'S STORY,Does me good to see your face!
2325,NANCY'S STORY,"Come in, gal, and dry your garments,"
2326,NANCY'S STORY,You have struck the very place!'

2330,NANCY'S STORY,
2331,NANCY'S STORY,"""You don't blame me, do you, Billy,"
2332,NANCY'S STORY,"If I did go in and stay,"
2333,NANCY'S STORY,"Warming by your stove and fire,"
2334,NANCY'S STORY,Just to hear what he would say?
2335,NANCY'S STORY,I will try to tell his story
2336,NANCY'S STORY,"As he told it, if I can,"
2337,NANCY'S STORY,Putting in what I remember
2338,NANCY'S STORY,Of his 'interesting plan.'
2339,NANCY'S STORY,"'Now, then, gal, I heard you calling"
2340,NANCY'S STORY,"As you stood there in the dark,"
2341,NANCY'S STORY,"On a fellow, named Bill Truly,"
2342,NANCY'S STORY,But you shot 'way off the mark.
2343,NANCY'S STORY,"Billy ain't here now, and further,"
2344,NANCY'S STORY,"He won't be here, you can bet;"
2345,NANCY'S STORY,"Anyhow, that's what he told me"
2346,NANCY'S STORY,"Two weeks past, when we last met."

2351,NANCY'S STORY,"""'When your folks all skipped the country"
2352,NANCY'S STORY,"I decided I'd move, too;"
2353,NANCY'S STORY,Thought perhaps you'd get in trouble
2354,NANCY'S STORY,And I'd try to help you through;
2355,NANCY'S STORY,"So I got beyond the posse,"
2356,NANCY'S STORY,"Rode like fire upon your track,"
2357,NANCY'S STORY,"Found your dad, and _you_ not with him,"
2358,NANCY'S STORY,So I turned and came right back.
2359,NANCY'S STORY,"Riding home along the Solomon,--"
2360,NANCY'S STORY,For the truth I pledge my word--
2361,NANCY'S STORY,I met Billy with his horses
2362,NANCY'S STORY,Three miles east of Mingo's Ford.
2363,NANCY'S STORY,Stopped and shook my hand and told me
2364,NANCY'S STORY,He was so far on his way
2365,NANCY'S STORY,"To a ranch 'way up in Utah,"
2366,NANCY'S STORY,Where he'd made his plans to stay.

2368,NANCY'S STORY,
2369,NANCY'S STORY,9
2370,NANCY'S STORY,
2371,NANCY'S STORY,"""'Said he wanted to be friendly,"
2372,NANCY'S STORY,"So the things that he had left,"
2373,NANCY'S STORY,"If I cherished no hard feelings,"
2374,NANCY'S STORY,I could look on as his gift.
2375,NANCY'S STORY,"""If you come across Miss Nancy"
2376,NANCY'S STORY,"You can say to her for me,"
2377,NANCY'S STORY,"That I've got another sweetheart,"
2378,NANCY'S STORY,"And that she is wholly free."""
2379,NANCY'S STORY,Billy'd never do to tie to--
2380,NANCY'S STORY,"He's too fickle, gal, for you--"
2381,NANCY'S STORY,So I just propose to offer
2382,NANCY'S STORY,You a man that will stay true.
2383,NANCY'S STORY,"I have worked it out, Miss Nancy--"
2384,NANCY'S STORY,It's the problem of my life;
2385,NANCY'S STORY,I have planned that you shall stay here
2386,NANCY'S STORY,As my own dear little wife.'

2392,NANCY'S STORY,When you say he's set me free!
2393,NANCY'S STORY,When you met him there at Mingo's
2394,NANCY'S STORY,He had gone to hunt for me.
2395,NANCY'S STORY,"Don't you dare to touch me, scoundrel!"
2396,NANCY'S STORY,Don't you dare to slur his name!
2397,NANCY'S STORY,You're a cur--a thief--Jim Johnson!
2398,NANCY'S STORY,You have jumped my sweetheart's claim.
2399,NANCY'S STORY,Don't you dare to venture near me!
2400,NANCY'S STORY,Or you'll wish you'd not begun.
2401,NANCY'S STORY,"All your schemes and double dealings,"
2402,NANCY'S STORY,All your hatched-up plans are done.

2412,NANCY'S STORY,And I felt to clinch his throat;
2413,NANCY'S STORY,"But, instead, I shot--to scare him--"
2414,NANCY'S STORY,All the buttons off his coat.
2415,NANCY'S STORY,"Then I pumped two in the corner,"
2416,NANCY'S STORY,Where he'd sunk down on his knees--
2417,NANCY'S STORY,"Slit his ear and cut his collar,"
2418,NANCY'S STORY,Never listening to his pleas.
2419,NANCY'S STORY,Told him if he didn't mosey
2420,NANCY'S STORY,"I would plant his carcass whole,"
2421,NANCY'S STORY,In a grave I'd dig that evening
2422,NANCY'S STORY,On the eighty he had stole.
2423,NANCY'S STORY,"Then he promised, but I chased him"
2424,NANCY'S STORY,"'Way across the old Saline,"
2425,NANCY'S STORY,"And so far as I have knowledge,"
2426,NANCY'S STORY,He has never since been seen.

2431,NANCY'S STORY,"""When I got back here 'fore morning,"
2432,NANCY'S STORY,"Thought of having Kelly's mare,"
2433,NANCY'S STORY,So I rode her to his stable
2434,NANCY'S STORY,And I left her standing there.
2435,NANCY'S STORY,For I knew that you'd consider
2436,NANCY'S STORY,"Twas the proper thing to do,"
2437,NANCY'S STORY,If you came back here and found me
2438,NANCY'S STORY,Holding down your claim for you.
2439,NANCY'S STORY,"But I felt right sorry, Billy,"
2440,NANCY'S STORY,"When I looked around next day,"
2441,NANCY'S STORY,In the box there in the corner
2442,NANCY'S STORY,Where the pans and dishes lay;
2443,NANCY'S STORY,"For in fixing for my breakfast,"
2444,NANCY'S STORY,My! the crockery was slim!
2445,NANCY'S STORY,More than half of it was busted
2446,NANCY'S STORY,By the bullets fired at Jim:

2456,NANCY'S STORY,You're the only man that's ever
2457,NANCY'S STORY,Crossed the threshold of that door.
2458,NANCY'S STORY,"I have stayed alone and waited,"
2459,NANCY'S STORY,"Full of faith that you would come,"
2460,NANCY'S STORY,"So that I--might go to daddie,"
2461,NANCY'S STORY,And that you'd--have back your home.
2462,NANCY'S STORY,Though perhaps I've sometimes suffered
2463,NANCY'S STORY,"From the cold and from the heat,"
2464,NANCY'S STORY,"And I've gone for days together,"
2465,NANCY'S STORY,"Here, without a bite to eat,"

2478,NANCY'S STORY,"Some one told me, I remember,"
2479,NANCY'S STORY,"Long ago when I was small,"
2480,NANCY'S STORY,"God made every star up yonder,"

2485,NANCY'S STORY,Of the heart that we call love.
2486,NANCY'S STORY,P'r'aps my troubles and the waiting
2487,NANCY'S STORY,Stirred me to this queer-like whim;
2488,NANCY'S STORY,"But I couldn't help it, Billy,"
