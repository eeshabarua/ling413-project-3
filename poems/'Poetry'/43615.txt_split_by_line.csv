105,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,TO J. G. FAIRFAX
106,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,
107,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Noon smote down on the field,"
108,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Burning on spears and helms,"
109,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Shining from Theseus' shield.
110,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,As a wave of the sea that whelms
111,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"A rock, and its crest uprears,"
112,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Through the wreck of the trampled wheat
113,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,The charge of the charioteers
114,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Thundering broke. A sleet
115,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Veiled light, and the air was alive,"
116,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"As with hissing of snakes, as with swarms"
117,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Of the Spring by a populous hive,"
118,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"As with wind, and the clamour of storms:"
119,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,So hurtled the arrowy hail
120,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Loosed from the Amazon ranks,"
121,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Smote ringing on brazen mail,"
122,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Struck fanged through the shuddering flanks
123,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Of the stallions; and half were hurled
124,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"In the dust, and broken, and brayed"
125,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"By the chariots over them whirled,"
126,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Which, eager and undismayed,"
127,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Swept ruining on to the hordes
128,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Of the Amazonian camp,"
129,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,With the lightning of terrible swords;
130,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Till the dead were heaped, as a ramp"
131,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,For the quick. But the chariots shocked
132,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,On the thicket of close-set spears;
133,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"And the long ranks reeled, and rocked,"
134,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Broke; and the charioteers
135,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Went through them, cleaving as ploughs"
136,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Cleave earth: they were rent, and tossed"
137,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,With the tumult of tortured boughs.
138,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"And the stallions, with foam embossed,"
139,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Fought, tearing each other with teeth,"
140,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"In the red, blind rage of their lust,"
141,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Screaming; and writhed underneath
142,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"The wounded, trodden as must"
143,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Of the grapes trodden out in the press,"
144,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Empurpling the knees, and bare"
145,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Thighs of the men. Through the stress
146,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Of their shoulders drove as a share,"
147,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Hippolyta. Avenging she came;
148,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"And they streamed, and they surged round her car,"
149,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,The women: her face was a flame
150,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,As she rode through the tempest of war;
151,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"And they cried, made glad with the sight,"
152,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"As those desiring the dawn,"
153,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"When the darkness is cloven by light,"
154,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Cry for gladness: they rallied, upborne,"
155,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,When she rayed as the sun through their cloud.
156,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"But she strung the bow, and she prayed"
157,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Unto Artemis, calling aloud,"
158,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,As a maid might call to a maid;
159,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,And the Goddess of shining brows
160,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Heard, as she paused from the chace"
161,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Upon Tainaros hoary with snows;
162,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,And a shadow darkened her face:
163,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"A shadow, and then a ray"
164,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Lightening, glorying, smiled,"
165,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,As her thought pierced years to a day
166,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Unborn, and an unborn child,"
167,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,With the pure fount of his praise
168,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Lifted to her, from the shrine"
169,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Rock-hewn, at the three cross-ways"
170,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"In a waste of hills, as wine"
171,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Gladdening her; and she shed
172,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"A wonder, a terror, a fear,"
173,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"A beauty that filled with dread,"
174,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,A glory no eyes might bear
175,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"On her maid; stooped, hushed, from the height"
176,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Her thought, as a bird on the wing,"
177,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Rained down from her, swifter than light."
178,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Hippolyta notched on the string
179,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"An arrow, and loosed it, and smote,"
180,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"As he drove at her car with a jest,"
181,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Agelaus, cleaving his throat"
182,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Speechless; and smote through the breast
183,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Polytherses; and Euenor then
184,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Felt the teeth of the flints at his veins,"
185,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,As his mares dragged him back to his men
186,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"All bloody, entangled in reins;"
187,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Then Damastor she smote: and they fled
188,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,As doves or as linnets fly
189,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,When a hawk that has towered overhead
190,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Stoops, ravening, out of the sky"
191,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,On their quires. But her arrows sighed
192,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"After them, swifter than feet:"
193,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"They ran, shrieked, stumbled, and died,"
194,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Shot through with her shafts. In the wheat,"
195,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"With the sunlight gilding their greaves,"
196,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Helmets, and shields, and mail,"
197,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"They lay, strewn thickly as leaves"
198,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,When Autumn has swung his flail.
199,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"But afar, where Thermodon rolled"
200,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"The deep, swift strength of its flood"
201,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"To the ocean turbidly gold,"
202,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Drave Theseus, eager for blood;"
203,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,And as herds stampede in affright
204,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,At the reek of the beast in the air
205,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Precipitately through the night
206,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"When a lion forth comes from his lair,"
207,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,So the women before him fled
208,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"In a rout, headlong, overborne,"
209,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"For he drave as a beast all red,"
210,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"With the blood of the prey he had torn,"
211,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Circled them round; they were rent,"
212,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Whirled under him, flung from him, far"
213,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Seaward, and lost; until spent,"
214,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Heaped in a mound by her car
215,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Broken, and dying, and dead,"
216,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Hippolyta saw. And she fled.
217,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,
218,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Theseus followed. Afar,"
219,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Over the storm of the spears,"
220,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,He had seen her face as a star
221,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Shine; and no tremble of tears
222,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Softened her terrible eyes,"
223,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Cruel they shone there, and blue"
224,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,With the beauty of windless skies.
225,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"But her bowstring ever she drew,"
226,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Loosening arrows that sang
227,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Through the air exulting as wind;
228,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,And the clamour of battle rang
229,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Most by her car, while behind"
230,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"The fierce, wild women upheld"
231,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Their queen, and their anger burned"
232,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,In staring eyeballs. She felled
233,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"A man as her car overturned,"
234,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Sped onward, her swift white feet"
235,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,The dead and the dying spurned
236,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Who lay in the wasted wheat.
237,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Theseus followed his prey
238,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,As a lean hound follows the fleet
239,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Quarry: the dusty way
240,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Smoked with the speed of his feet.
241,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,She was swift; but he burned in the chace:
242,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"He was flame, he was sandalled with fire,"
243,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Hungering after her face,"
244,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"With a fury, a lust, a desire,"
245,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,As a hound that whines for the blood
246,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Of the hart flying winged with fear;
247,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"And she yearned, and she longed for the wood,"
248,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Seeming far from her still, though near,"
249,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"And she strained, and she panted, and pressed,"
250,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"With her head flung backward for breath,"
251,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"And the quick sobs shaking her breast,"
252,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Agonised, now, as by death,"
253,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Fearing utterly, fighting with fate,"
254,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Stumbling. And swifter behind,"
255,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"With a love made hot by his hate,"
256,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Strained he pursuing. The wind,"
257,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Lifted, and played with the fold"
258,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Of her chlamys; and showed made bare
259,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"The swift limbs shining, as gold"
260,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"From sunlight, and streamed through her hair"
261,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"As wind in a cresset of fire,"
262,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"As tresses of flame in the night,"
263,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"While she fled, desired, from desire,"
264,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Till the brakes hid the flame from his sight.
265,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,
266,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Yea, but no long time he stood,"
267,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,As one who resigns the prize
268,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,When a moment baffled. The wood
269,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Hid her indeed from his eyes,"
270,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,But the track of her feet lay clean
271,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,As the slot of a deer in the grass.
272,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Slower he followed, and keen"
273,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Were his downcast eyes. As a glass
274,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,A wide lake gleamed in the ebb
275,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Of the latest tide of the light;
276,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,Stars shone clear through the web
277,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Of the branches, beckoning night;"
278,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"The leaves fell softly, gilt"
279,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"With autumn, and tawny and red;"
280,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"And the blue of the skies lay spilt,"
281,TO J. G. FAIRFAX,"Pooled, shining, from late rains shed;"

715,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,Were darkened at her coming; and a moan
716,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Broke from the shuddering boughs, and all the fleet"
717,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Leaves whirled about her passage, with the throng"
718,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Of her lamenting ghosts, who cried regret,"

721,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,
722,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Wherefore I grieve, that no more in my sight"
723,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,Are mortal women lovely. I am grown
724,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Amorous of her lips with kisses sweet,"
725,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,For her deep eyes in their enchantment strong.
726,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,Yea! I am wasted with my passion's fret:
727,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Restless, that my poor worship may not quit"
728,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"The pure light of her face, which made me wise."
729,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,
730,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Great peace she hath, and dreams for her delight,"
731,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Wherewith she weaves upon the Looms of Stone,"
732,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Choosing such colours as she deemeth meet,"
733,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Gold, blue, and vermeil skeins; and there among"
734,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Her spools of weaving threads, her dreams beget"
735,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Life, from her nimble fingers and quick wit,"
736,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Mirrored in mortal life, which fades and dies."
737,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,
738,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,These are made whole and perfect in the bright
739,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Broideries of her hands, while by her throne"
740,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Move unborn hours, which in her cave discrete"
741,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"She hideth, though her secret thoughts prolong"
742,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Soft moments mortal hearts so soon forget,"
743,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Bright, supple forms, with swift limbs strongly knit,"
744,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,Moving as light in dance as melodies.
745,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,
746,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Wherefore, though in the cold I wail my plight,"
747,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"And wander, through the hoary woods, alone,"
748,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Hunted, and smitten of the wind and sleet,"
749,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Among these rooted souls, I would not wrong"
750,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"The intense white flame of beauty mine eyes met,"
751,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,And married for a moment: in this pit
752,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,My blinded soul feeds on her memories.
753,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,
754,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,"Go, thou, my song! Tell her, though weeping, yet"
755,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,Her face is mine: such joy have I in it
756,TO DOROTHY SHAKESPEAR,I cannot shut the splendour from mine eyes.

894,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Lay me not there among the peaceful graves
895,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Where sleep your puny saints. I would go hence,"
896,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Over the loud ways of the sea again,"
897,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"In my black ship, with all the war-shields out,"
898,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Nor, beaten, crawl unto the knees of God,"
899,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"To whine there a whipped hound. Yea, send me forth"
900,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"As when I sought rich lands, and glittering gold,"
901,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And warm, white-breasted women, and red wine,"
902,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And all the splendour and the lust of war.
903,TO ALFRED FOWLER,
904,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Your Eden lies among soft-slipping streams,"
905,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Green meadows, orchards of o'er-laden boughs,"

909,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And convent women, such as wail all day"
910,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Before lit candles, in the idle fume"
911,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Of incense rising. I would go where sit

923,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Only I, I grow old, and bowed in head,"

957,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Ye have loved women, some of ye, and know"

977,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Hot on the laughing lips, love being a game"
978,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Now of your tamer men-folk with soft speech.
979,TO ALFRED FOWLER,But love to me was no light laughter heard
980,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Under a sickle moon, when blossoming brakes"
981,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Thrill with the nightingales, and eve is hushed"
982,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Like a blind maid, whose eyes are shut, and seem"
983,TO ALFRED FOWLER,To shut within herself her secret thoughts
984,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Lest men should know them, and be ware of love,"
985,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And waken, eager. Eager! Love to me"
986,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Pulsed in the fingers and would clasp what seems
987,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"So aerial a vision: to have, to hold,"
988,TO ALFRED FOWLER,To drink of: and I knew how flesh could bound
989,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Spirit; so that we lay drowsed, close to sleep,"
990,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Near as our bodies might, yet sundered thus"
991,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"With how irreparable loss! All time,"
992,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Unborn or buried, meeting with our mouths"
993,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"In a swift marriage, and the sacred night"
994,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Sweet with the song of arrowy desires
995,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Shot from the bow of life into our quick,"
996,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And rooted there. Yea, life in one full pulse,"

1004,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Toward the horizon's calm, as if there lay"
1005,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Peace, and the heart's desire, after much pain,"
1006,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Fulfilled at last. Quietly sitting there,"
1007,TO ALFRED FOWLER,She peoples all the blue of sea and skies
1008,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"With golden hopes of youth, giving them life"
1009,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"From her own yearning, though they are long dead"
1010,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And havened where dead years are. Such still eyes
1011,TO ALFRED FOWLER,She hath; and that strange patience women have
1012,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Whose dreams are broken. Love, with a keen sword,"
1013,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Smote me; I saw the blue flame leap and fall,"
1014,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"When first I saw her eyes: and dim the earth,"
1015,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And warfare, and seafaring, and the life"
1016,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Which sang, and went with joyful colours clad,"
1017,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Became until they were as frail as dreams;
1018,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"While, as they died in dusk, her face grew fair"
1019,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Swimming upon tired senses, as there swims"
1020,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Up from the wreck of day the night's first star
1021,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Quickening through the silence. So, in her,"
1022,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"The music and the colour of the world,"
1023,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"The splendours of the earth and sky and sea,"
1024,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Were shadowed: all of life was in her eyes.
1025,TO ALFRED FOWLER,
1026,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Her house a shambles; and I, standing there,"
1027,TO ALFRED FOWLER,A beast all red with slaughter. One white face
1028,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Like a white star! Was it not kingly spoil?
1029,TO ALFRED FOWLER,What man had not felt hunger in his hands
1030,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"To flutter over the smooth flesh, and know"
1031,TO ALFRED FOWLER,The wonder breathing? So even I must grasp
1032,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"That winged, brief, fragile beauty, with rude strength"
1033,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Fierce from the haste of hunger, ere I knew"
1034,TO ALFRED FOWLER,What God had breathed his fire into my clay.
1035,TO ALFRED FOWLER,
1036,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Yea! ere I knew, while yet I thought the gold"
1037,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Mere dross for traffic in the market-place,"
1038,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Such ware as I had dealt in. Mine eyes now
1039,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"See her, as she was then: the tall, slim grace,"
1040,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"The golden head upon its silver stalk,"
1041,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"As frail as April's dewy lilies are,"
1042,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Upon some wakening lawn; or as she lay
1043,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"With long, smooth, supple thighs and little breasts"
1044,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Bared, while mine eyes drank all the beauty in,"
1045,TO ALFRED FOWLER,As earth drinks dawn with gladness: but her eyes
1046,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Veiled suddenly, and quick red stained her cheeks,"
1047,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Flickering, and the bright soul fled from sight"
1048,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"To its obscure recesses, while my heart"
1049,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Filled, drop by drop, with that strange wine of joy"
1050,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Which raced like fire through me, until each sense"
1051,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Ached, for the joy it gave, and thirsted more,"
1052,TO ALFRED FOWLER,In plundering such pleasure. But her soul
1053,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Fled beyond reach of hands, remote, and veiled."
1054,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"She lay there as if dead, and all my love"
1055,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Was no more to her than the idle strength
1056,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Which breaks upon the beaches. I could feel,"
1057,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Sometimes, she breathed beside me, and her breath"
1058,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Came soft, and warm, through the red parted lips,"
1059,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Fragrant upon my face. That night was filled
1060,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"With myriad voices, myriad stars, and dews,"
1061,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"All choric! Yea, the very darkness glowed"
1062,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"With secret heat, as if the night were quick"
1063,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"By Love's own lord, and pregnant with a flame."
1064,TO ALFRED FOWLER,
1065,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"So was she mine, by the sword's right, whose heart"
1066,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Went dreaming out over the unquiet sea
1067,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"To Bergthorsknoll; and Sigurd, Olaf's son,"
1068,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Such an one as the hearts of maids desire,"
1069,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Being tall, and straight, and comely: never a man"
1070,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Made such a friend or foe, on land or sea"
1071,TO ALFRED FOWLER,His hands were skilful. I can love such men
1072,TO ALFRED FOWLER,In friendship or in fighting. He had come
1073,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"To Swinefell in his fighting-ship, when Spring"
1074,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Was white and ruddy in the fields and woods;
1075,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And they, perchance, had bent down o'er the fire"
1076,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"As day was closing, and had spoken low"
1077,TO ALFRED FOWLER,In the dim light; and he had sailed in June
1078,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Southward for prey, descending toward the Seine"
1079,TO ALFRED FOWLER,With help from Thrain the White in ships and men.
1080,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And I had come in autumn with my swords
1081,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"For vengeance of a wrong, and left Thrain's stead"
1082,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And town a heap of ash, being in wrath:"
1083,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Though it were shame to burn so tall a town,"
1084,TO ALFRED FOWLER,As men said; but the heart of me was grieved
1085,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"For some slight he had put on me, and black"
1086,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Is a man's anger; so I gave his stead
1087,TO ALFRED FOWLER,A prey to the red flames; and fighting died
1088,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Thrain, a man's death! But when I throned her here"
1089,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Men came and said, ""Lo, now will Sigurd come"
1090,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"For love of her, to take her hence again"
1091,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And burn Lithend for vengeance."" But I said,"
1092,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Running my fingers down the smooth, keen blade,"
1093,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"""Sigurd will come! Why then, let Sigurd come."""
1094,TO ALFRED FOWLER,
1095,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"But they all feared him, and again one spoke,"
1096,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Saying, ""Thy love will burn us, and our town."
1097,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Are there not many women in the world
1098,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"To mate with, but the one he loves?"" I struck"
1099,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"The craven fool a damned blow in the face,"
1100,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Whereat they kept their counsel, and were still."
1101,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"But one man, riding over a wild moor"
1102,TO ALFRED FOWLER,When the black night was blacker with a storm
1103,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Saw in the play of lightnings from the clouds
1104,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Twelve armoured women riding, and they swooped"
1105,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Eagle-wise on the earth, and riding came"
1106,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"To a lone house; and, spying through a chink,"
1107,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"He saw them weave a scarlet web of war,"
1108,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"With swords for shuttles, and men's heads for weights,"
1109,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And they sang at their weaving. In those days
1110,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"We sowed our corn with axes in our belts,"
1111,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And each man armoured, and my people went"
1112,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Fearfully, gazing out with anxious eyes"
1113,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Over the seas for an unfriendly sail,"
1114,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"While I sat silent, eating mine own heart,"
1115,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Until one ran with speed to me, as night"
1116,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Came, dropping silence on the shining sea,"
1117,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"A man with lucky eyes, who cried, ""They come!"""
1118,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Pointing toward the rim of ocean, red"
1119,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"With the sun's blood; and that sight gladdened me,"
1120,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"To see their slack sails, idle, in a gore"
1121,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Of dying glories, while their oars dripped fire,"
1122,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Labouring up against the ebbing tide.
1123,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"""They will come weary,"" said I, ""and, perchance,"
1124,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Lack water."" And I set an ambush, there"
1125,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Where Rangriver turns bitter with the sea,"
1126,TO ALFRED FOWLER,If thirst should lure them; and they came with skins
1127,TO ALFRED FOWLER,To fill; and there we played a little while
1128,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"With knives and axes, while they ran, and tripped"
1129,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Over gnarled roots and boulders in the dark,"
1130,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Calling their friends, and knew not where they ran,"
1131,TO ALFRED FOWLER,For we would call the names we heard them call
1132,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"In feigning, and thus lure them from the path."
1133,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Twenty tall fellows slew we in this wise,"
1134,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Making the odds more even, and that night"
1135,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"They watched their ships, and lit the beach with fires"
1136,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"So that they might not fight an unseen foe,"
1137,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Who struck them through the darkness. But I went
1138,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Homeward, and to the chamber where she lay"
1139,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Sleeping, with tears upon her face; but sleep"
1140,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Had stilled her troubles. As I looked on her,"
1141,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Her breath came softly, like a child's. I watched,"
1142,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Wondering if death might hold as fair a thing,"
1143,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Hungering, though I would not break her dreams."
1144,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"All night I watched her, that mine heart might keep"
1145,TO ALFRED FOWLER,One face to dream of through the dark of death
1146,TO ALFRED FOWLER,If he should slay me. Then a sense of dawn
1147,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Stole gradually through the blue, wet air;"
1148,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Cool dawn, with dew and silence, fair and fresh!"
1149,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"In the white light she lay there, and I looked"
1150,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Long on her: and I left her then, and went,"
1151,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Calling my men, and led them thence afield"
1152,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"To a smooth level sward, for fighting made,"
1153,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Between the gray bents and the leafy woods,"
1154,TO ALFRED FOWLER,A dancing-ground for maidens. Such a stir
1155,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Came from the beached black ships, as April, hears"
1156,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"About the populous hives, when the blown scents"
1157,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Lure, to their garnering, the frugal bees,"
1158,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And they swarm forth: so swarmed upon the shore
1159,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Sigurd's well-armoured men: some by the fires
1160,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Eating, some buckling on their gleaming arms,"
1161,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Shouting their war-songs, beating on their shields"
1162,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Full of rude jests; and I saw Sigurd there,"
1163,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Standing apart, long-haired, and great of limb,"
1164,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"With a soft silken kirtle, and his helm,"
1165,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Winged, flaming in the sunlight. Then my men"
1166,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Halted, for vantage of the broken ground,"
1167,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"While I strode out upon the sward, and called"
1168,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"To Sigurd; but blind rage gat hold of him,"
1169,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And he came at me, whirling his bright axe."
1170,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And I leapt out to meet him, so men say,"
1171,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Laughing, and ran upon him, and his blow"
1172,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Broke down my guard, and bit the shoulder-bone,"
1173,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"But mine axe clove clean through the angry face,"
1174,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Right to the brain; and, as I drew it back,"
1175,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"He swayed, and fell, and his bronze armour rang"
1176,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Loudly; and from both armies came a shout
1177,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Crying, ""Sigurd is slain! Sigurd is slain!"""
1178,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"One mourning and one joyous, while my men"
1179,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Stood round him prone, and marvelled at his strength,"
1180,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And no one feared him now. But they came on
1181,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Avenging, and the crashing of their shock"
1182,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Broke round us; and the ringing blows, and shouts,"
1183,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And screams of dying men were born aloft
1184,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"With dust of battle; and lightening axes whirled,"
1185,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Lifting and falling: keen, and bright, and blue"
1186,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"They fell, but they were lifted dull and red,"
1187,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"While we rolled backward and forward in waves of fight,"
1188,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And fluctuating chance, and those who fell,"
1189,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Drowned there, amid the press of trampling feet."
1190,TO ALFRED FOWLER,
1191,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"So, all day long, the uncertain combat flowed,"
1192,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Between the gray bents and the broken ground;
1193,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And the smooth sward was cumbered with the dead,"
1194,TO ALFRED FOWLER,On whom we stumbled. But at last the night
1195,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Came, shadowing with her blue veils the sea,"
1196,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And we and they drew off; and when the noise
1197,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Of war was stilled, and only moans of men"
1198,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Broke silence, with the laughter of the sea"
1199,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"That curled, and foamed, and rippled on the beach,"
1200,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"I hailed them, and they answered me, and sent"
1201,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Tall Flosi, son of Gunnar, their best man"
1202,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Since Sigurd fell. Over the level sward,"
1203,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Now with the dead strown thick as shocks of corn
1204,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"After a reaping, strode he; and the moon"
1205,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Tipped his bright spear with silver, lit his helm"
1206,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And burnished shield; but when his eyes and mine
1207,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Met, and he knew me, he stood waiting there."
1208,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And I spoke, pointing, with my spear, to those"
1209,TO ALFRED FOWLER,White faces staring sightless to the moon
1210,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"From the smooth sward: ""Lo! let us make a truce"
1211,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And mourn these dead, for they were goodly men."
1212,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"My friends or thine, who lie there strengthless now"
1213,TO ALFRED FOWLER,With Sigurd whom I slew. Him men shall mourn
1214,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"In Bergthorsknoll, as the bright gods in heaven"
1215,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Mourn golden Balder; but his praise shall be
1216,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Within the hearts and on the lips of men
1217,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"A song for ever. Him I hated not,"
1218,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Nay, rather loved! Though he bore hate to me"
1219,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"For Swinefell's spoiling, and for Gudrun's sake,"
1220,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Her, whom mine eyes beholding, straight mine heart"
1221,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Desired with all its strength. So for one prize
1222,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Strove we, nor could we yield, but one must die:"
1223,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Whence lies he there. The gods have willed it so!
1224,TO ALFRED FOWLER,But let us build a pyre within his ship
1225,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Heaped up with spoil, and let us mourn for him,"
1226,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And launch him, burning, on the eternal sea."
1227,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And when the dawn of the third day is red,"
1228,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"If your mind is for fighting, we shall fight"
1229,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Again; or ye shall launch your ships and go
1230,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Over the bright ways of the shining sea."""
1231,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"I spake, and Flosi answered, gazing down"
1232,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Upon the dead, whose armour glimmered there"
1233,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Under the shining moon, as glimmer pools"
1234,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Innumerable in the leafless woods:
1235,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"""Yea, one slim maid hath slain too many men."
1236,TO ALFRED FOWLER,
1237,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Well is she Gudrun called, unto men's hearts"
1238,TO ALFRED FOWLER,A snare and peril! What is in one face
1239,TO ALFRED FOWLER,That men should die for it? A kitchen slut
1240,TO ALFRED FOWLER,To some dull clown is royal. But he lies
1241,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"There, and I cannot hold mine heart from tears"
1242,TO ALFRED FOWLER,So loved I him: I count all women light
1243,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"As flax beside his loss. Why didst not thou,"
1244,TO ALFRED FOWLER,When we two met amid the ringing blows
1245,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And mine axe failed me, strike?"" And I, to him,"
1246,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Impatient, for my wound was cold and irked"
1247,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"My shoulder: ""Go, and boast among the ships"
1248,TO ALFRED FOWLER,That Helgi fled thee. Helmsdale held me once.
1249,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"I could not slay thee for Kiartan's sake."""
1250,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And he, astonied, stood there, as if light"
1251,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Fell on remembered places in his heart:
1252,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"""Kiartan! O Kiartan!"" broke from him"
1253,TO ALFRED FOWLER,In one long sigh; and he drew in his breath
1254,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Quickly, remembering his brother's stead"
1255,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Above the land-locked bays; and his heart saw
1256,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"His mother bend down over the bright hearth,"
1257,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"With her sweet, patient face, so old and wise,"
1258,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Lit by the flickering firelight. Thus he stood,"
1259,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Forgetting war and death; and when he spoke
1260,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Again, his voice was changed, and soft in speech,"
1261,TO ALFRED FOWLER,While we went down toward the twinkling fires
1262,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"That lit the shore, and set a watch with brands"
1263,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"To scare the wolves, who barked within the woods,"
1264,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Snuffing the tainted air. And Flosi came,"
1265,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Alone of all the Jarls, up to mine house,"
1266,TO ALFRED FOWLER,While they abode there. And when dawn was red
1267,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Upon the third day, launching their black ships,"
1268,TO ALFRED FOWLER,They went upon the bright ways of the sea.
1269,TO ALFRED FOWLER,
1270,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Softly the sails dropped down that sea of light
1271,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Under the milky skies; all liquid gold
1272,TO ALFRED FOWLER,The pure fire broken by the cleaving prows
1273,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And whitening in their wake; as I watched them
1274,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"I thought all life went thus, man's voyaging heart,"
1275,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Over the loud, glad, golden ways of time."
1276,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"With oars taught by a song, to seek some joy,"
1277,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Some rapture, some warm isle in happy seas,"
1278,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Adventuring. A lure there is for us
1279,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"In far horizons, dreamed-of, misty lands."
1280,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"A voice that calls us. Yea, but look on love!"
1281,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"She lay there who, but two nights past, had watched"
1282,TO ALFRED FOWLER,One burning ship drift over the sea's rim
1283,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Into the dark. Was she not mine indeed,"
1284,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Now, whom mine arm had won? All mine! all mine!"
1285,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"The long, bright braids of hair; the little breasts,"
1286,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Like cups of carven ivory; the smooth,"
1287,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Cool, marble whiteness; curves one knew by touch"
1288,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Only, too gradual for eyes: it seemed"
1289,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"God's hands, there, had felt joy in them, and wrought"
1290,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Delighting: and the blue eyes, brimmed with light;"
1291,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And thee, my son, forged in the intense hour's flame"
1292,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And inmost heat of whiteness. Mine! all mine!
1293,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"All mine: and yet some shadow slipped from me,"
1294,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Some frail, soft, sweet, intangible delight"
1295,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Escaping from mine hands. So have I gone
1296,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Over blue windless seas, bare of all life,"
1297,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And urged the labouring oars; but every dawn
1298,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Showed still the same blue, stainless shield, whose boss"
1299,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Was our one ship, until it hushed our songs,"
1300,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"That deep, vast, desolating blue of sky"
1301,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And tranquil waters. I had all of her
1302,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"But some few drops of joy she yielded not,"
1303,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"They being hers to give or keep, a dew"
1304,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Distilled within her soul. Yea, I loved her!"
1305,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"I think no love is peace, and we but break"
1306,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Against each other; and our hands are vain
1307,TO ALFRED FOWLER,To grasp what is worth holding; and our sense
1308,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Too coarse a net to snare what no speech saith,"
1309,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"We go alone through all our days, alone"
1310,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Even when all is given! But him she loved;
1311,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And dreamed upon his face, remembering."
1312,TO ALFRED FOWLER,
1313,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Even so, I am glad! Yea, all my heart is glad"
1314,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"I had her for mine own. I grasped the joy,"
1315,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"The quick, warm, breathing life; and if the dream"
1316,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Fled from me, yet mine hands held priceless things,"
1317,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And dreams are winged to fly. They are poor fools
1318,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Who deem the better love is a bowed heart
1319,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And silent lips. If thou hadst beauty close,"
1320,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Because the white bird fluttered on thy breast,"
1321,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Wouldst loose it? Or would not a quicker pulse
1322,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Beat in thine heart, and eager fingers close"
1323,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"More firmly on the snowy, ruffled plumes,"
1324,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Till the thing yielded, panting? Will ye win?"
1325,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Then must ye dare. There is a lean saint stalled
1326,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Somewhere among my scullions, in the stead:"
1327,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"A half-drowned rat we haled from out the sea,"
1328,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Who says God saved him! He stakes his poor life,"
1329,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Having not strength enough to lift mine axe,"
1330,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Against a greater glory. Love to him
1331,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Is as a golden net to snare his feet,"
1332,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And women perilous lures: he would keep them maids,"
1333,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Nor make one mother, but would rather see"
1334,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Life, which the gods made lovely, fade and die"
1335,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Ashen as winter woods, nor break again"
1336,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"In all the foaming blossom of the spring,"
1337,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Whitening every field. He never knew
1338,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"The keen, sweet joy that smites through every sense"
1339,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Into the shuddering soul, and whelms the world"
1340,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"In an immortal glory, while God builds"
1341,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Life beyond us, creating out of clay"
1342,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"The world's imperishable dream, the hope,"
1343,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"The wonder, the desire, that gives us sight"
1344,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Beyond our mortal doom. I have little wit;
1345,TO ALFRED FOWLER,I only know that in the looms of time
1346,TO ALFRED FOWLER,God's will moves like a shuttle to and fro.
1347,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"I have heard him in the waves, and on the wind;"
1348,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"I have seen his splendour shine among the swords,"
1349,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Soften the eyes of women, light and smile"
1350,TO ALFRED FOWLER,On a child's lips; and know his presence there
1351,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Where all the waves stream eagerly to lick
1352,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"The sunset's bloody splendours. Balder, the bright"
1353,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Beautiful Balder, whose eyes hold our hope,"
1354,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Who hath made love a light, and life a song,"
1355,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"In all men's eyes, and on their lips, who hath sown"
1356,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"The fields of heaven thick with golden fires,"
1357,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"As men sow corn: and forges in this flame,"
1358,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Of life, with ringing blows, a strong man's soul"
1359,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"As swords are fashioned, keen-edged, straight, and blue,"
1360,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"How shall I die dispraising thee, whose praise"
1361,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Comes, laden with the blown scents of the spring,"
1362,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Opening dewy eyelids of bright buds,"
1363,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And brings the swallows? Thee I will not curse,"
1364,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Nor life, nor women, nor the fool himself"
1365,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Who blinks weak eyes, and calls the glory vain."
1366,TO ALFRED FOWLER,
1367,TO ALFRED FOWLER,The sea is darkened now; and I can hear
1368,TO ALFRED FOWLER,The long moan of the waves upon the shore.
1369,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Some fret is on me! I would go again
1370,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Over the gray fields of the restless sea,"
1371,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Among the vexed waves and the stinging spray.
1372,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Nay, one drowns here in death; and why not there"
1373,TO ALFRED FOWLER,To wash about among the changing tides
1374,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Under the changing moon? I would not rest
1375,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Within a little earth. As Sigurd went,"
1376,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Send me; and she will watch me burning, drift"
1377,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Over the rim of Ocean, ere I sink"
1378,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Into the dark still deeps, where are ribbed wrecks"
1379,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And strong men dead. Lo! it is time to die,"
1380,TO ALFRED FOWLER,For the old glory fades out of the world
1381,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And the swords rust in peace. Yea, I would go"
1382,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Now, for this death is but another sea"
1383,TO ALFRED FOWLER,To venture on; a strong man will win through
1384,TO ALFRED FOWLER,And cast up somewhere on another shore
1385,TO ALFRED FOWLER,With his old lust for fighting. All of life
1386,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"I have seen, and many cities of proud kings,"
1387,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"And I have gotten gold, and wine, and fame,"
1388,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Among strange peoples, and white girls were mine"
1389,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"To love a little while on drowsy nights,"
1390,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"When a low, yellow moon lights up a land"
1391,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Full of ripe stooks. Now it is time to go,"
1392,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Regretting nothing. Gudrun, come to me!"
1393,TO ALFRED FOWLER,"Come to me, Gudrun! Lean thy lovely face"
1394,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Over me once again. 'Tis wet with tears:
1395,TO ALFRED FOWLER,We have grown close together. Weep no more;
1396,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Let the old wonder light up in thine eyes;
1397,TO ALFRED FOWLER,Death will be dark without it.
