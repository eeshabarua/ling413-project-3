95,CHRISTMAS EVE,
96,CHRISTMAS EVE,'Twas Christmas Eve.
97,CHRISTMAS EVE,The mother and her little boy (his name
98,CHRISTMAS EVE,Was David Annandale) sat down to read
99,CHRISTMAS EVE,And converse hold before they sought repose.
100,CHRISTMAS EVE,"A widow young, with richest auburn hair,"
101,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Bright hazel eyes 'neath finely arching brows,"
102,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Teeth of pearl, and sympathetic smile"
103,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Most sweet.  No wonder that her child, a lad"
104,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Of six, with raven hair and ruddy cheeks,"
105,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Should find in her alone his heart's desire,"
106,CHRISTMAS EVE,"His reigning thought, the perfect one.  His eyes"
107,CHRISTMAS EVE,Lovelit no blemish saw in careworn looks.
108,CHRISTMAS EVE,
109,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Her stories, read and told with girlish zeal,"
110,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Of beaver, bear and wolf, and jet black squirrel,"
111,CHRISTMAS EVE,"But, best of all, of smiling Santa Claus,"
112,CHRISTMAS EVE,Aroused an interest intense.  The deep
113,CHRISTMAS EVE,Ravine itself and other themes all passed
114,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Beneath her spell.  And he, tho' entertained,"
115,CHRISTMAS EVE,Was also purified and lifted up.
116,CHRISTMAS EVE,"""My mother, dear,"" he said, ""When I'm a man,"
117,CHRISTMAS EVE,"I'll work and work for you, and buy a castle"
118,CHRISTMAS EVE,"And a carriage; you will be a lady,"
119,CHRISTMAS EVE,"And nevermore be tired."""
120,CHRISTMAS EVE,
121,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Tired himself at last,"
122,CHRISTMAS EVE,"His eyelids fell.  He dreamed a moment deep,"
123,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Then wide awoke and starting up he wept,"
124,CHRISTMAS EVE,"And as he sobbed he said, ""I've seen my kitten"
125,CHRISTMAS EVE,"In the cold ravine.  Oh, let it in!"""
126,CHRISTMAS EVE,"This was a kitten lost a while before,"
127,CHRISTMAS EVE,A creature in his heart as much as treasure
128,CHRISTMAS EVE,Real or ideal fills the heart
129,CHRISTMAS EVE,Of any ardent man.  He ever longed
130,CHRISTMAS EVE,And hoped for its return.  And every night
131,CHRISTMAS EVE,The door was opened and the yearning call
132,CHRISTMAS EVE,Went out into the empty air.  And every
133,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Night he saw the lost one's dish supplied,"
134,CHRISTMAS EVE,Which morning found untouched.  The mother did
135,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Her best to stay his tears, and as she bent"
136,CHRISTMAS EVE,And tucked him warm in bed she said that maybe
137,CHRISTMAS EVE,Santa Claus would bring another kitten.
138,CHRISTMAS EVE,"""Tie a great big stocking, mother; make it"
139,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Open wide and warm.""  She did so, kissed him,"
140,CHRISTMAS EVE,And he closed his eyes.
141,CHRISTMAS EVE,
142,CHRISTMAS EVE,"One hand alone,"
143,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Would fill that empty stocking, nor forget"
144,CHRISTMAS EVE,"A friend or neighbor would come later on,"
145,CHRISTMAS EVE,But David's eyes when morning came would look
146,CHRISTMAS EVE,"On emptiness, save for mother's hand.  Nay, stay,--"
147,CHRISTMAS EVE,"At midnight, yea, at midnight, when the moon"
148,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Was still a silver lamp, a creature poor,"
149,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Benighted, wandered to the cottage door."
150,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Ill-treated, cold, too sick to cry, it looked"
151,CHRISTMAS EVE,With wistful eyes beneath the fastened door.
152,CHRISTMAS EVE,Then turned and went aside and trembling climbed
153,CHRISTMAS EVE,The sloping birchen tree and reached the roof.
154,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Adown the chimney peered, then slowly crept,"
155,CHRISTMAS EVE,Then fell.  It lay upon the hearth a time.
156,CHRISTMAS EVE,"But lured, it lapped the milk, and, strengthened, strove"
157,CHRISTMAS EVE,To climb into the little sleeper's cot.
158,CHRISTMAS EVE,"It strove but failed, and, guided by a gentle"
159,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Hand, it fell at last into the open"
160,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Stocking, head above, and finding comfort,"
161,CHRISTMAS EVE,Softly purred and slept.
162,CHRISTMAS EVE,
163,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Ah, sleeping boy,"
164,CHRISTMAS EVE,Thou dreamest not the joy awaiting thee--
165,CHRISTMAS EVE,The empty place within thy heart shall soon
166,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Be filled, thy grief assuaged, thy hot tears dried."
167,CHRISTMAS EVE,'Tis little value--but 'tis much to thee--
168,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Because thy love is wrapped up there, and love"
169,CHRISTMAS EVE,Is value's measure in the heart of rich
170,CHRISTMAS EVE,And poor.
171,CHRISTMAS EVE,
172,CHRISTMAS EVE,The boy awoke and rubbed his eyes.
173,CHRISTMAS EVE,"The sun had risen o'er the grand ravine,"
174,CHRISTMAS EVE,"A silver scene, and sent its slanting rays"
175,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Of gold beneath the blind, across the cot."
176,CHRISTMAS EVE,"He waited not, but crept along and looked"
177,CHRISTMAS EVE,Below.  Two eyes looked up.  A moment mutual
178,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Magnetized, transfixed!  He drew the creature"
179,CHRISTMAS EVE,"From its woollen bed, he kissed it,--pressed it"
180,CHRISTMAS EVE,To his cheek--and wept for joy.  The mother
181,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Woke.  The midnight ""gift"" was seen and gladly"
182,CHRISTMAS EVE,"Welcomed home while David slept, and now"
183,CHRISTMAS EVE,She also wept for joy.  No home was happier
184,CHRISTMAS EVE,On that Christmas morn.  No gift was costlier
185,CHRISTMAS EVE,Than the gift that meant the wasted worthless
186,CHRISTMAS EVE,Waif's return.

194,THE LURKING FOE,
195,THE LURKING FOE,"Till early spring (too soon),"
196,THE LURKING FOE,"While David went to school, and learned well,"
197,THE LURKING FOE,The widow bravely labored on 'mid frost
198,THE LURKING FOE,"And snow and storm, thro' strain of overwork"
199,THE LURKING FOE,"And worse.  Inhaled, mayhap, from matter bad,"
200,THE LURKING FOE,Close-handled in her calling (who can trace
201,THE LURKING FOE,The lurking venom foe?) the wasting plague
202,THE LURKING FOE,Had found a cruel lodgment in her breast.
203,THE LURKING FOE,"""One hope remains,"" the kind physician said--"
204,THE LURKING FOE,Who made no charge for visits not a few--
205,THE LURKING FOE,"""'Tis institutional treatment where the air"
206,THE LURKING FOE,"Is light and pure, where food is plentiful,"
207,THE LURKING FOE,"And rest abounds."""
208,THE LURKING FOE,
209,THE LURKING FOE,The parting wrench was sore.
210,THE LURKING FOE,"The mother hid her grief and tears, and smiled,"
211,THE LURKING FOE,But David wept without restraint.  A farming
212,THE LURKING FOE,Couple sympathetic offered refuge
213,THE LURKING FOE,"For awhile, and when he went away"
214,THE LURKING FOE,"(His kitten in a basket 'neath his arm),"
215,THE LURKING FOE,"His heart was heavy--for the sun was down,"
216,THE LURKING FOE,The world was dark.
217,THE LURKING FOE,
218,THE LURKING FOE,But five months' treatment free
219,THE LURKING FOE,"Was great and good, and David's mother seemed"
220,THE LURKING FOE,"To be restored to health, for strength was there"
221,THE LURKING FOE,"And color beautiful.  'Twas not enough,"
222,THE LURKING FOE,"Tho' all that could be given, that other waiting"
223,THE LURKING FOE,Sufferers might have a chance to live.
224,THE LURKING FOE,With rest at home the healing work begun
225,THE LURKING FOE,Would one day be complete.
226,THE LURKING FOE,
227,THE LURKING FOE,"Ye men of wealth,"
228,THE LURKING FOE,"And all that generous give, with all that halt,"
229,THE LURKING FOE,Herein your golden opportunity
230,THE LURKING FOE,Doth lie.  A home you have prepared for them
231,THE LURKING FOE,"That leave the prison cell, and this is well."
232,THE LURKING FOE,But what awaits the convalescent widow
233,THE LURKING FOE,"And the orphan, fighting off the wasting plague?"
234,THE LURKING FOE,Suspicion--dread--a refuge craved for vainly
235,THE LURKING FOE,"Here and there--a battle hopeless, lost."
236,THE LURKING FOE,"Awake, awake!  Oh, give the shelter sure"
237,THE LURKING FOE,A child would give to any famished waif!
238,THE LURKING FOE,"Oh, wake, compassion, wake!"
239,THE LURKING FOE,
240,THE LURKING FOE,"When David, big"
241,THE LURKING FOE,"With joy, returned, the wind sang in the trees,"
242,THE LURKING FOE,"The flowers, red and white, a welcome smiled,"
243,THE LURKING FOE,"The cottage seemed to be a prince's home,"
244,THE LURKING FOE,"And mother in her loveliness a queen,"
245,THE LURKING FOE,While in the mother's eyes her child appeared
246,THE LURKING FOE,"As if a shepherd lad, he looked so strong,"
247,THE LURKING FOE,"So lithe, and ruddy.  But the only flock"
248,THE LURKING FOE,"That David had consisted of a kitten,"
249,THE LURKING FOE,Now a cat renowned of tiger-stripe
250,THE LURKING FOE,And fat.  And once again the cottage-home
251,THE LURKING FOE,"Gave foretaste of the other, deathless, pure,"
252,THE LURKING FOE,"And glad, for love was there."
253,THE LURKING FOE,
254,THE LURKING FOE,With quenchless hope
255,THE LURKING FOE,The happy widow bravely bent her shoulders
256,THE LURKING FOE,To the yoke again.  She had her boy
257,THE LURKING FOE,"To live for, work for, love, and he would be"
258,THE LURKING FOE,"A man some day, and strong, when she would lean"
259,THE LURKING FOE,On him as he had leaned on her.  And yet
260,THE LURKING FOE,"The yoke was heavy, and grew heavier"
261,THE LURKING FOE,As vigour waned.  In spite of hope and will
262,THE LURKING FOE,She craved for rest.  Or even if the wage
263,THE LURKING FOE,"Were better, labour could be lessened"
264,THE LURKING FOE,And give more of rest.
265,THE LURKING FOE,

270,ON STRIKE,
271,ON STRIKE,One day some workmen
272,ON STRIKE,Struck for better pay.  And David wondered
273,ON STRIKE,"What it meant to strike.  ""What is it, mother?--"
274,ON STRIKE,"Do they hit the men that give them work?"""
275,ON STRIKE,"The mother smiled.  ""No, no, my child, they merely"
276,ON STRIKE,Rest or cease from work to force their masters
277,ON STRIKE,Into giving better pay to get them
278,ON STRIKE,"Back to work.""  A happy thought now seized him--"
279,ON STRIKE,"""Oh, mother, strike, and then the people sure"
280,ON STRIKE,"Will give you better pay.""  The mother smiled,"
281,ON STRIKE,"But sighed and said, ""My darling boy, if I"
282,ON STRIKE,"Should strike, a score of women poor are ready,"
283,ON STRIKE,"Even glad, to take my place, perchance for less."""
284,ON STRIKE,"The boy was disappointed, and his heart"
285,ON STRIKE,Was sad.
286,ON STRIKE,
287,ON STRIKE,"But ""strike,"" that odd word strike, as meaning"
288,ON STRIKE,"Rest from work, or stopping work, clung fast"
289,ON STRIKE,To David's mind.  Apart from better pay
290,ON STRIKE,"He thought that something good remained, and so"
291,ON STRIKE,"At night, the last thing done before he slept,"
292,ON STRIKE,"The boy would often take his board, a blackboard"
293,ON STRIKE,"Big, and chalk in letters large and white--"
294,ON STRIKE,"""On strike till 7,"" ""On strike till 6,"" ""On strike"
295,ON STRIKE,"Till 5,"" according as his mother's work"
296,ON STRIKE,"Required, or strength could stand.  The metal clock,"
297,ON STRIKE,"A loud alarum, was also wound and set."
298,ON STRIKE,"At this the mother always smiled, but when"
299,ON STRIKE,Her treasure's eyes were closed in sleep she wept.
300,ON STRIKE,She dared not bend and kiss those cherub lips.
301,ON STRIKE,"His lovely face grew paler day by day,"
302,ON STRIKE,"And dread, an awful dread, laid hold of her."
303,ON STRIKE,And she herself was wasting swift and sure--
304,ON STRIKE,The candle flame was burning low.

310,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,
311,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Two nights, not more, before the Christmas eve,"
312,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,A heap of things for washing lay against
313,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"The wall.  Alas, at any time too great,"
314,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"The present task might break the weary back,"
315,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,But Christmas need was pressing and the labour
316,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Must be done.  (Oh, spare that wasted frame!"
317,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Hear, O Lord, the widow's cry!)"
318,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,
319,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"The weary, yet the watchful boy,"
320,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,His blackboard took and wrote in letters big
321,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"And urgent, seeming charged with meaning strange."
322,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,And the clock's alarum was set.  And now
323,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,On bended knee beside his mother's knee
324,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"He spoke his simple prayer, pleading lastly"
325,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,That his mother might have better wages
326,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"And have rest.  And, oh, the mother's heart"
327,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Went with him, with himself before the throne,"
328,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Forgetful, ay entirely, of herself."
329,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"A wild temptation seized her.  She would clasp,"
330,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Yea, fiercely hug, that wasted angel-body"
331,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"To her breast, and kiss those guileless, beauteous,"
332,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,Sweetest lips.  Alas! she knew the worst
333,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Had come--those eyes, uplifted, hollow, shining,"
334,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Spoke of death.  And why refrain?  She would not,"
335,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Yea, she drank the cup of pleasure to the full."
336,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"The child was glad, and went to rest,"
337,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,A smile of heaven on his lips.
338,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,
339,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"And now the mother satisfied, as one"
340,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"With strongest wine, rose up, and ope'd the door."
341,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"She looked abroad a moment, then went out"
342,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,Into the silent air.  The deep ravine
343,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,Was glorious white.  The mighty pines were robed
344,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,As if prepared to sing in heaven's choir
345,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"On earth, when strong the northern tempest blew."
346,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"The widow, vigour getting for a little"
347,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"From the frosty air, admired the scene,"
348,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,And lifting up her eyes to sparkling worlds
349,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Above, she felt assured, though human help"
350,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"And pity wholly failed, that somewhere, sometime,"
351,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,There was plenteous rest.
352,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,
353,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,And yet she thanked
354,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"And praised the Power that good and evil gave,"
355,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"For one brief cup of pleasure, if no more--"
356,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Her pleasure in her darling boy.  ""Take him,"
357,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"O Lord, whatever portion mine."""
358,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,
359,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"The tension loosed,"
360,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"The stricken widow turned, yet ere she turned"
361,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"She scanned the northern shore of brilliant night,"
362,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"And, lo, a mountain mass of tempest clouds"
363,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,Lined up for battle with the sleeping south.
364,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"The woman, fearless, smiled as if in kinship"
365,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,With the coming storm.
366,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,
367,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"But having struggled, spoken,"
368,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Pleaded strong, her transient vigour gone,"
369,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,She stumbled to the door and entered in.
370,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Beside the bed, she saw the letters written"
371,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"On the board, as if the sacred writing"
372,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,On the wall.  She saw the slender lovely hand
373,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Exposed that wrote them, and she bowed and kissed it,"
374,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,But she could not weep.
375,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,
376,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Ere midnight came,"
377,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"The child awoke, disturbed, and anxious said,"
378,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"""Oh, mother dear, what is that awful sound?"""
379,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"""My darling, 'tis the sighing of the wind"
380,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Among the pines.""  But swifter sped the tempest,"
381,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Swifter, and the pines--they bowed their heads"
382,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,Before the blast and sang.  The cedars high
383,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"And oaks together answered back in song,"
384,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"And louder, louder, as if thunder grand,"
385,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,The tempest bell of music rang.  The boy
386,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Awoke again, and feebly cried--""Oh, mother,"
387,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"I'm afraid--what is that dreadful sound?"""
388,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"""My darling, fear not, 'tis the voice of God--"
389,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,He leads the choir.  And he remembers you
390,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"And me.""  ""Oh, mother, take me in beside you,"
391,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"I'm afraid of God, but Jesus""--Here he stopped."
392,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,He struggled till he got in part athwart
393,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,The cot.  And as his wearied head sank down
394,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"He whispered faintly, and there came a broken"
395,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"Answer, whispering--""Near me, nearer, darling""--"
396,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,That was all.
397,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,
398,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"The storm, the mother's music."
399,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,"But the child's affright, attained its height."
400,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,Then sudden rang the loud alarum.  But
401,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,They heard it not.

407,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,But God hath both exalted high.  And once

409,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS,By men.  But God on it had mercy.
