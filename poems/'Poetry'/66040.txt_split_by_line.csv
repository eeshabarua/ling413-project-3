39,I,"Set ope all shutters, that the day come in"
40,I,Like a sea or a din!
41,I,Let not a nook of useless shade compel
42,I,"Thoughts of the night, or tell"
43,I,"The mind's comparing that some things are sad,"
44,I,For this day all are glad!
45,I,"'Tis morn, 'tis open morn, the full sun is"
46,I,Risen from out the abyss
47,I,Where last night lay beyond the unseen rim
48,I,Of the horizon dim.
49,I,Now is the bride awaking. Lo! she starts
50,I,To feel the day is home
51,I,Whose too-near night will put two different hearts
52,I,To beat as near as flesh can let them come.
53,I,"Guess how she joys in her feared going, nor opes"
54,I,Her eyes for fear of fearing at her joy.
55,I,Now is the pained arrival of all hopes.
56,I,With the half-thought she scarce knows how to toy.
57,I,
58,I,"Oh, let her wait a moment or a day"
59,I,And prepare for the fray
60,I,For which her thoughts not ever quite prepare!
61,I,With the real day's arrival she's half wroth.
62,I,"Though she wish what she wants, she yet doth stay."
63,I,Her dreams yet merged are
64,I,"In the slow verge of sleep, which idly doth"
65,I,The accurate hope of things remotely mar.

72,II,
73,II,Part from the windows the small curtains set
74,II,Sight more than light to omit!
75,II,"Look on the general fields, how bright they lie"
76,II,"Under the broad blue sky,"
77,II,"Cloudless, and the beginning of the heat"
78,II,Does the sight half ill-treat!
79,II,The bride hath wakened. Lo! she feels her shaking
80,II,Heart better all her waking!
81,II,Her breasts are with fear's coldness inward clutched
82,II,"And more felt on her grown,"
83,II,That will by hands other than hers be touched
84,II,And will find lips sucking their budded crown.
85,II,Lo! the thought of the bridegroom's hands already
86,II,"Feels her about where even her hands are shy,"
87,II,And her thoughts shrink till they become unready.
88,II,She gathers up her body and still doth lie.
89,II,She vaguely lets her eyes feel opening.
90,II,In a fringed mist each thing
91,II,"Looms, and the present day is truly clear"
92,II,But to her sense of fear.
93,II,"Like a hue, light lies on her lidded sight,"
94,II,And she half hates the inevitable light.

101,III,
102,III,Open the windows and the doors all wide
103,III,"Lest aught of night abide,"
104,III,"Or, like a ship's trail in the sea, survive"
105,III,What made it there to live!
106,III,She lies in bed half waiting that her wish
107,III,Grow bolder or more rich
108,III,"To make her rise, or poorer, to oust fear,"
109,III,And she rise as a common day were here.
110,III,That she would be a bride in bed with man
111,III,The parts where she is woman do insist
112,III,And send up messages that shame doth ban
113,III,From being dreamed but in a shapeless mist.
114,III,"She opes her eyes, the ceiling sees above"
115,III,"Shutting the small alcove,"
116,III,"And thinks, till she must shut her eyes again,"
117,III,"Another ceiling she this night will know,"
118,III,"Another house, another bed, she lain"
119,III,In a way she half guesses; so
120,III,She shuts her eyes to see not the room she
121,III,Soon will no longer see.

126,IV,IV
127,IV,
128,IV,
129,IV,Let the wide light come through the whole house now
130,IV,Like a herald with brow
131,IV,Garlanded round with roses and those leaves
132,IV,That love for its love weaves!
133,IV,Between her and the ceiling this day's ending
134,IV,A man's weight will be bending.
135,IV,"Lo! with the thought her legs she twines, well knowing"
136,IV,A hand will part them then;
137,IV,"Fearing that entering in her, that allowing"
138,IV,That will make softness begin rude at pain.
139,IV,"If ye, glad sunbeams, are inhabited"
140,IV,"By sprites or gnomes that dally with the day,"
141,IV,"Whisper her, if she shrink that she'll be bled,"
142,IV,That love's large bower is doored in this small way.

148,V,
149,V,
150,V,Now will her grave of untorn maidenhood
151,V,Be dug in her small blood.
152,V,Assemble ye at that glad funeral
153,V,"And weave her scarlet pall,"
154,V,O pinings for the flesh of man that often
155,V,Did her secret hours soften
156,V,And take her willing and unwilling hand
157,V,Where pleasure starteth up.
158,V,"Come forth, ye moted gnomes, unruly band,"
159,V,That come so quick ye spill your brimming cup;
160,V,Ye that make youth young and flesh nice
161,V,And the glad spring and summer sun arise;
162,V,Ye by whose secret presence the trees grow
163,V,"Green, and the flowers bud, and birds sing free,"
164,V,When with the fury of a trembling glow
165,V,The bull climbs on the heifer mightily!

173,VI,"Sing at her window, ye heard early wings"
174,VI,In whose song joy's self sings!
175,VI,"Buzz in her room along her loss of sleep,"
176,VI,"O small flies, tumble and creep"
177,VI,Along the counterpane and on her fingers
178,VI,In mating pairs. She lingers.
179,VI,Along her joined-felt legs a prophecy
180,VI,Creeps like an inward hand.
181,VI,Look how she tarries! Tell her: fear not glee!
182,VI,Come up! Awake! Dress for undressing! Stand!
183,VI,Look how the sun is altogether all!
184,VI,Life hums around her senses petalled close.
185,VI,Come up! Come up! Pleasure must thee befall!
186,VI,"Joy to be plucked, O yet ungathered rose!"

192,VII,
193,VII,
194,VII,"Now is she risen. Look how she looks down,"
195,VII,"After her slow down-slid night-gown,"
196,VII,On her unspotted while of nakedness
197,VII,Save where the beast's difference from her white frame
198,VII,Hairily triangling black below doth shame
199,VII,"Her to-day's sight of it, till the caress"
200,VII,Of the chemise cover her body. Dress!
201,VII,"Stop not, sitting upon the bed's hard edge,"
202,VII,"Stop not to wonder at by-and-bye, nor guess!"
203,VII,List to the rapid birds i'th' window ledge!
204,VII,"Up, up and washed! Lo! she is up half-gowned,"
205,VII,For she lacks hands to have power to button fit
206,VII,"The white symbolic wearing, and she's found"
207,VII,"By her maids thus, that come to perfect it."
208,VII,
209,VII,
210,VII,
211,VII,
212,VIII,VIII
213,VIII,
214,VIII,
215,VIII,Look how over her seeing-them-not her maids
216,VIII,Smile at each other their same thought of her!
217,VIII,Already is she deflowered in others' thoughts.
218,VIII,"With curious carefulness of inlocked braids,"
219,VIII,"With hands that in the sun minutely stir,"
220,VIII,One works her hair into concerted knots.
221,VIII,"Another buttons tight the gown; her hand,"
222,VIII,"Touching the body's warmth of life, doth band"
223,VIII,Her thoughts with the rude bridegroom's hand to be.
224,VIII,"The first then, on the veil placed mistily,"
225,VIII,"Lays on her head, her own head sideways leaning,"
226,VIII,The garland soon to have no meaning.
227,VIII,"The other, at her knees, makes the white shoon"
228,VIII,"Fit close the trembling feet, and her eyes see"
229,VIII,"The stockinged leg, road upwards to that boon"
230,VIII,Where all this day centres its revelry.

235,IX,IX
236,IX,
237,IX,
238,IX,"Now is she gowned completely, her face won"
239,IX,To a flush. Look how the sun
240,IX,"Shines hot and how the creeper, loosed, doth strain"
241,IX,To hit the heated pane!
242,IX,"She is all white, all she's awaiting him."
243,IX,Her eyes are bright and dim.
244,IX,"Her hands are cold, her lips are dry, her heart"
245,IX,Pants like a pursued hart.

250,X,X
251,X,
252,X,
253,X,Now is she issued. List how all speech pines
254,X,Then bursts into a wave of speech again!
255,X,Now is she issued out to where the guests
256,X,Look on her daring not to look at them.
257,X,The hot sun outside shines.
258,X,A sweaty oiliness of hot life rests
259,X,On the day's face this hour.
260,X,A mad joy's pent in each warm thing's hushed power.

265,XI,XI
266,XI,
267,XI,
268,XI,Hang with festoons and wreaths and coronals
269,XI,The corridors and halls!
270,XI,Be there all round the sound of gay bells ringing!
271,XI,Let there be echoing singing!
272,XI,Pour out like a libation all your joy!
273,XI,"Shout, even ye children, little maid and boy"
274,XI,Whose belly yet unfurred yet whitely decks
275,XI,A sexless thing of sex!
276,XI,Shout out as if ye knew what joy this is
277,XI,You clap at in such bliss!

283,XII,
284,XII,
285,XII,This is the month and this the day.
286,XII,Ye must not stay.
287,XII,Sally ye out and in warm clusters move
288,XII,To where beyond the trees the belfry's height
289,XII,"Does in the blue wide heaven a message prove,"
290,XII,"Somewhat calm, of delight."
291,XII,Now flushed and whispering loud sally ye out
292,XII,"To church! The sun pours on the ordered rout,"
293,XII,And all their following eyes clasp round the bride:
294,XII,They feel like hands her bosom and her side;
295,XII,"Like the inside of the vestment next her skin,"
296,XII,They round her round and fold each crevice in;
297,XII,"They lift her skirts up, as to tease or woo"
298,XII,The cleft hid thing below;
299,XII,And this they think at her peeps in their ways
300,XII,And in their glances plays.
301,XII,
302,XII,
303,XII,
304,XII,
305,XIII,XIII
306,XIII,
307,XIII,
308,XIII,"No more, no more of church or feast, for these"
309,XIII,"Are outward to the day, like the green trees"
310,XIII,That flank the road to church and the same road
311,XIII,"Back from the church, under a higher sun trod."
312,XIII,These have no more part than a floor or wall
313,XIII,In the great day's true ceremonial.
314,XIII,"The guests themselves, no less than they that wed,"
315,XIII,Hold these as nought but corridors to bed.
316,XIII,"So are all things, that between this and dark"
317,XIII,"Will be passed, a dim work"
318,XIII,"Of minutes, hours seen in a sleep, and dreamed"
319,XIII,Untimed and wrongly deemed.
320,XIII,The bridal and the walk back and the feast
321,XIII,Are all for each a mist
322,XIII,Where he sees others through a blurred hot notion
323,XIII,"Of drunk and veined emotion,"
324,XIII,"And a red race runs through his seeing and hearing,"
325,XIII,"A great carouse of dreams seen each on each,"
326,XIII,Till their importunate careering
327,XIII,"A stopped, half-hurting point of mad joy reach."
328,XIII,
329,XIII,
330,XIII,
331,XIII,
332,XIV,XIV
333,XIV,
334,XIV,
335,XIV,The bridegroom aches for the end of this and lusts
336,XIV,"To know those paps in sucking gusts,"
337,XIV,To put his first hand on that belly's hair
338,XIV,"And feel for the lipped lair,"
339,XIV,"The fortress made but to be taken, for which"
340,XIV,He feels the battering ram grow large and itch.
341,XIV,The trembling glad bride feels all the day hot
342,XIV,On that still cloistered spot
343,XIV,Where only her nightly maiden hand did feign
344,XIV,A pleasure's empty gain.
345,XIV,"And, of the others, most will whisper at this,"
346,XIV,Knowing the spurt it is;
347,XIV,"And children yet, that watch with looking eyes,"
348,XIV,Will now thrill to be wise
349,XIV,"In flesh, and with big men and women act"
350,XIV,The liquid tickling fact
351,XIV,For whose taste they'll in secret corners try
352,XIV,They scarce know what still dry.

357,XV,XV
358,XV,
359,XV,
360,XV,"Even ye, now old, that to this come as to"
361,XV,"Your past, your own joy throw"
362,XV,"Into the cup, and with the younger drink"
363,XV,That which now makes you think
364,XV,Of what love was when love was. (For not now
365,XV,Your winter thoughts allow).
366,XV,"Drink with the hot day, the bride's sad joy and"
367,XV,"The bridegroom's haste inreined,"
368,XV,The memory of that day when ye were young
369,XV,"And, with great paeans sung"
370,XV,"Along the surface of the depths of you,"
371,XV,You paired and the night saw
372,XV,"The day come in and you did still pant close,"
373,XV,And still the half-fallen flesh distending rose.
374,XV,
375,XV,
376,XV,
377,XV,
378,XVI,XVI
379,XVI,
380,XVI,
381,XVI,No matter now or past or future. Be
382,XVI,Lovers' age in your glee!
383,XVI,Give all your thoughts to this great muscled day
384,XVI,That like a courser tears
385,XVI,"The bit of Time, to make night come and say"
386,XVI,The maiden mount now her first rider bears!
387,XVI,"Flesh pinched, flesh bit, flesh sucked, flesh girt around,"
388,XVI,"Flesh crushed and ground,"
389,XVI,These things inflame your thoughts and make ye dim
390,XVI,In what ye say or seem!
391,XVI,Rage out in naked glances till ye fright
392,XVI,"Your ague of delight,"
393,XVI,In glances seeming clothes and thoughts to hate
394,XVI,That fleshes separate!
395,XVI,"Stretch out your limbs to the warm day outside,"
396,XVI,To feel it while it bide!
397,XVI,"For the strong sun, the hot ground, the green grass,"
398,XVI,"Each far lake's dazzling glass,"
399,XVI,And each one's flushed thought of the night to be
400,XVI,Are all one joy-hot unity.

404,XVI,
405,XVII,XVII
406,XVII,
407,XVII,
408,XVII,In a red bacchic surge of thoughts that beat
409,XVII,"On the mad temples like an ire's amaze,"
410,XVII,"In a fury that hurts the eyes, and yet"
411,XVII,"Doth make all things clear with a blur around,"
412,XVII,The whole group's soul like a glad drunkard sways
413,XVII,And bounds up from the ground!
414,XVII,"Ay, though all these be common people heaping"
415,XVII,"To church, from church, the bridal keeping,"
416,XVII,Yet all the satyrs and big pagan haunches
417,XVII,"That in taut flesh delight and teats and paunches,"
418,XVII,"And whose course, trailing through the foliage, nears"
419,XVII,"The crouched nymph that half fears,"
420,XVII,"In invisible rush, behind, before"
421,XVII,"This decent group move, and with hot thoughts store"
422,XVII,"The passive souls round which their mesh they wind,"
423,XVII,"The while their rout, loud stumbling as if blind,"
424,XVII,Makes the hilled earth wake echoing from her sleep
425,XVII,To the lust in their leap.

430,XVIII,XVIII
431,XVIII,
432,XVIII,
433,XVIII,Io! Io! There runs a juice of pleasure's rage
434,XVIII,"Through these frames' mesh,"
435,XVIII,That now do really ache to strip and wage
436,XVIII,Upon each others' flesh
437,XVIII,The war that fills the womb and puts milk in
438,XVIII,"The teats a man did win,"
439,XVIII,The battle fought with rage to join and fit
440,XVIII,And not to hurt or hit!
441,XVIII,Io! Io! Be drunken like the day and hour!
442,XVIII,"Shout, laugh and overpower"
443,XVIII,"With clamour your own thoughts, lest they a breath"
444,XVIII,Utter of age or death!
445,XVIII,"Now is all absolute youth, and the small pains"
446,XVIII,That thrill the filled veins
447,XVIII,Themselves are edged in a great tickling joy
448,XVIII,That halts ever ere it cloy.
449,XVIII,Put out of mind all things save flesh and giving
450,XVIII,The male milk that makes living!
451,XVIII,Rake out great peals of joy like grass from ground
452,XVIII,In your o'ergrown soul found!
453,XVIII,Make your great rut dispersedly rejoice
454,XVIII,"With laugh or voice,"
455,XVIII,"As if all earth, hot sky and tremulous air"
456,XVIII,A mighty cymbal were!
457,XVIII,
458,XVIII,
459,XVIII,
460,XVIII,
461,XIX,XIX
462,XIX,
463,XIX,
464,XIX,Set the great Flemish hour aflame!
465,XIX,Your senses of all leisure maim!
466,XIX,Cast down with blows that joy even where they hurt
467,XIX,The hands that mock to avert!
468,XIX,All things pick up to bed that lead ye to
469,XIX,Be naked that ye woo!
470,XIX,"Tear up, pluck up, like earth who treasure seek,"
471,XIX,"When the chest's ring doth peep,"
472,XIX,The thoughts that cover thoughts of the acts of heat
473,XIX,This great day does intreat!
474,XIX,Now seem all hands pressing the paps as if
475,XIX,They meant them juice to give!
476,XIX,"Now seem all things pairing on one another,"
477,XIX,"Hard flesh soft flesh to smother,"
478,XIX,And hairy legs and buttocks balled to split
479,XIX,White legs mid which they shift.
480,XIX,Yet these mixed mere thoughts in each mind but speak
481,XIX,"The day's push love to wreak,"
482,XIX,"The man's ache to have felt possession,"
483,XIX,"The woman's man to have on,"
484,XIX,The abstract surge of life clearly to reach
485,XIX,The bodies' concrete beach.
486,XIX,Yet some work of this doth the real day don.
487,XIX,"Now are skirts lifted in the servants' hall,"
488,XIX,And the whored belly's stall
489,XIX,"Ope to the horse that enters in a rush,"
490,XIX,"Half late, too near the gush."
491,XIX,And even now doth an elder guest emmesh
492,XIX,"A flushed young girl in a dark nook apart,"
493,XIX,And leads her slow to move his produced flesh.
494,XIX,Look how she likes with something in her heart
495,XIX,To feel her hand work the protruded dart!

497,XIX,
498,XIX,
499,XIX,
500,XX,XX
501,XX,
502,XX,
503,XX,But these are thoughts or promises or but
504,XX,"Half the purpose of rut,"
505,XX,And this is lust thought-of or futureless
506,XX,Or used but lust to ease.
507,XX,"Do ye the circle true of love pretend,"
508,XX,"And, what Nature, intend!"
509,XX,Do ye actually ache
510,XX,The horse of lust by reins of life to bend
511,XX,And pair in love for love's creating sake!
512,XX,Bellow! Roar! Stallions be or bulls that fret
513,XX,On their seed's hole to get!
514,XX,Surge for that carnal complement that will
515,XX,Your flesh's young juice thrill
516,XX,To the wet mortised joints at which you meet
517,XX,"The coming life to greet,"
518,XX,In the tilled womb that will bulge till it do
519,XX,The plenteous curve of spheric earth renew!

524,XXI,XXI
525,XXI,
526,XXI,
527,XXI,"And ye, that wed to-day, guess these instincts"
528,XXI,Of the concerted group in hints
529,XXI,"Yourselves from Nature naturally have,"
530,XXI,And your good future brave!
531,XXI,"Close lips, nude arms, felt breasts and organ mighty,"
532,XXI,Do your joy's night work rightly!
533,XXI,"Teach them these things, O day of pomp of heat!"
534,XXI,Leave them in thoughts such as must make the feat
535,XXI,Of flesh inevitable and natural as
536,XXI,Pissing when wish doth press!
537,XXI,"Let them cling, kiss and fit"
538,XXI,"Together with natural wit,"
539,XXI,"And let the night, coming, teach them that use"
540,XXI,For youth is in abuse!
541,XXI,"Let them repeat the link, and pour and pour"
542,XXI,Their pleasure till they can no more!
543,XXI,"Ay, let the night watch over their repeated"
544,XXI,"Coupling in darkness, till thought's self, o'erheated,"
545,XXI,"Do fret and trouble, and sleep come on hurt frames,"
546,XXI,"And, mouthing each one's names,"
547,XXI,They in each other's arms dream still of love
548,XXI,And something of it prove!
549,XXI,"And, if they wake, teach them to recommence,"
550,XXI,For an hour was far hence;
551,XXI,"Till their contacted flesh, in heat o'erblent"
552,XXI,"With joy, sleep sick, while, spent"
553,XXI,"The stars, the sky pale in the East and shiver"
554,XXI,"Where light the night doth sever,"
555,XXI,And with clamour of joy and life's young din
556,XXI,The warm new day come in.
