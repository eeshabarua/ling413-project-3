589,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And why the laurel trembles when she sees the lightening east.
590,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
591,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And I will sing how sad Proserpina
592,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Unto a grave and gloomy Lord was wed,"
593,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And lure the silver-breasted Helena
594,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Back from the lotus meadows of the dead,"
595,THE GARDEN OF EROS,So shalt thou see that awful loveliness
596,THE GARDEN OF EROS,For which two mighty Hosts met fearfully in war’s abyss!
597,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
598,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And then I’ll pipe to thee that Grecian tale
599,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"How Cynthia loves the lad Endymion,"
600,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And hidden in a grey and misty veil
601,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Hies to the cliffs of Latmos once the Sun
602,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Leaps from his ocean bed in fruitless chase
603,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Of those pale flying feet which fade away in his embrace.
604,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
605,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"And if my flute can breathe sweet melody,"
606,THE GARDEN OF EROS,We may behold Her face who long ago
607,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Dwelt among men by the Ægean sea,"
608,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And whose sad house with pillaged portico
609,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And friezeless wall and columns toppled down
610,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Looms o’er the ruins of that fair and violet cinctured town.
611,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
612,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Spirit of Beauty! tarry still awhile,"
613,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"They are not dead, thine ancient votaries;"
614,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Some few there are to whom thy radiant smile
615,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Is better than a thousand victories,"
616,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Though all the nobly slain of Waterloo
617,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Rise up in wrath against them! tarry still, there are a few"
618,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
619,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Who for thy sake would give their manlihood
620,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And consecrate their being; I at least
621,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Have done so, made thy lips my daily food,"
622,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And in thy temples found a goodlier feast
623,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Than this starved age can give me, spite of all"
624,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Its new-found creeds so sceptical and so dogmatical.
625,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
626,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Here not Cephissos, not Ilissos flows,"
627,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"The woods of white Colonos are not here,"

629,THE GARDEN OF EROS,No simple priest conducts his lowing steer

631,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Do laughing maidens bear to thee the crocus-flowered gown.
632,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
633,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Yet tarry! for the boy who loved thee best,"
634,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Whose very name should be a memory
635,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"To make thee linger, sleeps in silent rest"
636,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Beneath the Roman walls, and melody"
637,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Still mourns her sweetest lyre; none can play
638,THE GARDEN OF EROS,The lute of Adonais: with his lips Song passed away.
639,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
640,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Nay, when Keats died the Muses still had left"
641,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"One silver voice to sing his threnody,"
642,THE GARDEN OF EROS,But ah! too soon of it we were bereft
643,THE GARDEN OF EROS,When on that riven night and stormy sea
644,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Panthea claimed her singer as her own,"
645,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"And slew the mouth that praised her; since which time we walk alone,"
646,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
647,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Save for that fiery heart, that morning star"
648,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Of re-arisen England, whose clear eye"
649,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Saw from our tottering throne and waste of war
650,THE GARDEN OF EROS,The grand Greek limbs of young Democracy
651,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Rise mightily like Hesperus and bring
652,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"The great Republic! him at least thy love hath taught to sing,"
653,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
654,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"And he hath been with thee at Thessaly,"
655,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And seen white Atalanta fleet of foot
656,THE GARDEN OF EROS,In passionless and fierce virginity
657,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Hunting the tuskèd boar, his honied lute"
658,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Hath pierced the cavern of the hollow hill,"
659,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And Venus laughs to know one knee will bow before her still.
660,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
661,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"And he hath kissed the lips of Proserpine,"
662,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"And sung the Galilæan’s requiem,"
663,THE GARDEN OF EROS,That wounded forehead dashed with blood and wine
664,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"He hath discrowned, the Ancient Gods in him"
665,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Have found their last, most ardent worshipper,"
666,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And the new Sign grows grey and dim before its conqueror.
667,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
668,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Spirit of Beauty! tarry with us still,"
669,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"It is not quenched the torch of poesy,"
670,THE GARDEN OF EROS,The star that shook above the Eastern hill
671,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Holds unassailed its argent armoury
672,THE GARDEN OF EROS,From all the gathering gloom and fretful fight—
673,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"O tarry with us still! for through the long and common night,"
674,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
675,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Morris, our sweet and simple Chaucer’s child,"
676,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Dear heritor of Spenser’s tuneful reed,"
677,THE GARDEN OF EROS,With soft and sylvan pipe has oft beguiled
678,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"The weary soul of man in troublous need,"
679,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And from the far and flowerless fields of ice
680,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Has brought fair flowers to make an earthly paradise.
681,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
682,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"We know them all, Gudrun the strong men’s bride,"
683,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Aslaug and Olafson we know them all,"
684,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"How giant Grettir fought and Sigurd died,"
685,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And what enchantment held the king in thrall
686,THE GARDEN OF EROS,When lonely Brynhild wrestled with the powers
687,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"That war against all passion, ah! how oft through summer hours,"
688,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
689,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Long listless summer hours when the noon
690,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Being enamoured of a damask rose
691,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Forgets to journey westward, till the moon"
692,THE GARDEN OF EROS,The pale usurper of its tribute grows
693,THE GARDEN OF EROS,From a thin sickle to a silver shield
694,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"And chides its loitering car—how oft, in some cool grassy field"
695,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
696,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Far from the cricket-ground and noisy eight,"
697,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"At Bagley, where the rustling bluebells come"
698,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Almost before the blackbird finds a mate
699,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"And overstay the swallow, and the hum"
700,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Of many murmuring bees flits through the leaves,"
701,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Have I lain poring on the dreamy tales his fancy weaves,"
702,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
703,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And through their unreal woes and mimic pain
704,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Wept for myself, and so was purified,"
705,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And in their simple mirth grew glad again;
706,THE GARDEN OF EROS,For as I sailed upon that pictured tide
707,THE GARDEN OF EROS,The strength and splendour of the storm was mine
708,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Without the storm’s red ruin, for the singer is divine;"
709,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
710,THE GARDEN OF EROS,The little laugh of water falling down
711,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Is not so musical, the clammy gold"
712,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Close hoarded in the tiny waxen town
713,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Has less of sweetness in it, and the old"
714,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Half-withered reeds that waved in Arcady
715,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Touched by his lips break forth again to fresher harmony.
716,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
717,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Spirit of Beauty, tarry yet awhile!"
718,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Although the cheating merchants of the mart
719,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"With iron roads profane our lovely isle,"
720,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"And break on whirling wheels the limbs of Art,"
721,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Ay! though the crowded factories beget
722,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"The blindworm Ignorance that slays the soul, O tarry yet!"
723,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
724,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"For One at least there is,—He bears his name"
725,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"From Dante and the seraph Gabriel,—"
726,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Whose double laurels burn with deathless flame
727,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"To light thine altar; He too loves thee well,"
728,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Who saw old Merlin lured in Vivien’s snare,"

730,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
731,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Loves thee so well, that all the World for him"
732,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"A gorgeous-coloured vestiture must wear,"
733,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"And Sorrow take a purple diadem,"

735,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Gild its own thorns, and Pain, like Adon, be"
736,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Even in anguish beautiful;—such is the empery
737,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
738,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Which Painters hold, and such the heritage"
739,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"This gentle solemn Spirit doth possess,"
740,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Being a better mirror of his age
741,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"In all his pity, love, and weariness,"
742,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Than those who can but copy common things,"
743,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And leave the Soul unpainted with its mighty questionings.
744,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
745,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"But they are few, and all romance has flown,"
746,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"And men can prophesy about the sun,"
747,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"And lecture on his arrows—how, alone,"
748,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Through a waste void the soulless atoms run,"
749,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"How from each tree its weeping nymph has fled,"
750,THE GARDEN OF EROS,And that no more ’mid English reeds a Naiad shows her head.
751,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
752,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Methinks these new Actæons boast too soon
753,THE GARDEN OF EROS,That they have spied on beauty; what if we
754,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Have analysed the rainbow, robbed the moon"
755,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Of her most ancient, chastest mystery,"
756,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Shall I, the last Endymion, lose all hope"
757,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Because rude eyes peer at my mistress through a telescope!
758,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
759,THE GARDEN OF EROS,What profit if this scientific age
760,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Burst through our gates with all its retinue
761,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Of modern miracles!  Can it assuage
762,THE GARDEN OF EROS,One lover’s breaking heart? what can it do
763,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"To make one life more beautiful, one day"
764,THE GARDEN OF EROS,More godlike in its period? but now the Age of Clay
765,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
766,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Returns in horrid cycle, and the earth"
767,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Hath borne again a noisy progeny
768,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Of ignorant Titans, whose ungodly birth"
769,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Hurls them against the august hierarchy
770,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Which sat upon Olympus; to the Dust
771,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"They have appealed, and to that barren arbiter they must"
772,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
773,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Repair for judgment; let them, if they can,"
774,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"From Natural Warfare and insensate Chance,"

776,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Methinks that was not my inheritance;
777,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"For I was nurtured otherwise, my soul"
778,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Passes from higher heights of life to a more supreme goal.
779,THE GARDEN OF EROS,
780,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Lo! while we spake the earth did turn away
781,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Her visage from the God, and Hecate’s boat"
782,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Rose silver-laden, till the jealous day"
783,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Blew all its torches out: I did not note
784,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"The waning hours, to young Endymions"
785,THE GARDEN OF EROS,Time’s palsied fingers count in vain his rosary of suns!
786,THE GARDEN OF EROS,

788,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Leans back its throat, as though it would be kissed"
789,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"By its false chamberer, the dragon-fly,"
790,THE GARDEN OF EROS,"Who, like a blue vein on a girl’s white wrist,"

1165,THE NEW HELEN,The sons of God fought in that great emprise?
1166,THE NEW HELEN,Why dost thou walk our common earth again?
1167,THE NEW HELEN,"Hast thou forgotten that impassioned boy,"
1168,THE NEW HELEN,His purple galley and his Tyrian men
1169,THE NEW HELEN,And treacherous Aphrodite’s mocking eyes?
1170,THE NEW HELEN,"For surely it was thou, who, like a star"
1171,THE NEW HELEN,"Hung in the silver silence of the night,"
1172,THE NEW HELEN,Didst lure the Old World’s chivalry and might
1173,THE NEW HELEN,Into the clamorous crimson waves of war!
1174,THE NEW HELEN,
1175,THE NEW HELEN,Or didst thou rule the fire-laden moon?
1176,THE NEW HELEN,In amorous Sidon was thy temple built
1177,THE NEW HELEN,Over the light and laughter of the sea
1178,THE NEW HELEN,"Where, behind lattice scarlet-wrought and gilt,"

1198,THE NEW HELEN,"Whose slumbering vales forlorn Calypso knew,"
1199,THE NEW HELEN,Where never mower rose at break of day
1200,THE NEW HELEN,"But all unswathed the trammelling grasses grew,"
1201,THE NEW HELEN,And the sad shepherd saw the tall corn stand
1202,THE NEW HELEN,Till summer’s red had changed to withered grey?
1203,THE NEW HELEN,Didst thou lie there by some Lethæan stream
1204,THE NEW HELEN,"Deep brooding on thine ancient memory,"

1220,THE NEW HELEN,"Lie in thy hand; O, be thou kind to me,"

1234,THE NEW HELEN,"Back to the tower of thine old delight,"
1235,THE NEW HELEN,And the red lips of young Euphorion;
1236,THE NEW HELEN,"Nor shall I ever see thy face again,"
1237,THE NEW HELEN,"But in this poisonous garden-close must stay,"
1238,THE NEW HELEN,"Crowning my brows with the thorn-crown of pain,"
1239,THE NEW HELEN,Till all my loveless life shall pass away.
1240,THE NEW HELEN,
1241,THE NEW HELEN,"O Helen!  Helen! Helen! yet a while,"

1244,THE NEW HELEN,For in the gladsome sunlight of thy smile
1245,THE NEW HELEN,"Of heaven or hell I have no thought or fear,"
1246,THE NEW HELEN,Seeing I know no other god but thee:
1247,THE NEW HELEN,"No other god save him, before whose feet"
1248,THE NEW HELEN,"In nets of gold the tired planets move,"
1249,THE NEW HELEN,The incarnate spirit of spiritual love
1250,THE NEW HELEN,Who in thy body holds his joyous seat.

1252,THE NEW HELEN,Thou wert not born as common women are!
1253,THE NEW HELEN,"But, girt with silver splendour of the foam,"

1255,THE NEW HELEN,"And at thy coming some immortal star,"
1256,THE NEW HELEN,"Bearded with flame, blazed in the Eastern skies,"
1257,THE NEW HELEN,And waked the shepherds on thine island-home.
1258,THE NEW HELEN,Thou shalt not die: no asps of Egypt creep
1259,THE NEW HELEN,Close at thy heels to taint the delicate air;
1260,THE NEW HELEN,"No sullen-blooming poppies stain thy hair,"
1261,THE NEW HELEN,Those scarlet heralds of eternal sleep.

1263,THE NEW HELEN,"Lily of love, pure and inviolate!"
1264,THE NEW HELEN,Tower of ivory! red rose of fire!

1266,THE NEW HELEN,"For we, close-caught in the wide nets of Fate,"
1267,THE NEW HELEN,"Wearied with waiting for the World’s Desire,"
1268,THE NEW HELEN,"Aimlessly wandered in the House of gloom,"
1269,THE NEW HELEN,Aimlessly sought some slumberous anodyne

1271,THE NEW HELEN,"Till we beheld thy re-arisen shrine,"
1272,THE NEW HELEN,And the white glory of thy loveliness.

1374,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Unthrifty of its beauty; lilies too
1375,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Ilissos never mirrored star our streams, and cockles blue"
1376,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1377,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Dot the green wheat which, though they are the signs"
1378,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"For swallows going south, would never spread"
1379,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Their azure tents between the Attic vines;
1380,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Even that little weed of ragged red,"
1381,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Which bids the robin pipe, in Arcady"
1382,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Would be a trespasser, and many an unsung elegy"
1383,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1384,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Sleeps in the reeds that fringe our winding Thames
1385,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Which to awake were sweeter ravishment
1386,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Than ever Syrinx wept for; diadems
1387,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Of brown bee-studded orchids which were meant
1388,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,For Cytheræa’s brows are hidden here
1389,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Unknown to Cytheræa, and by yonder pasturing steer"
1390,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1391,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"There is a tiny yellow daffodil,"
1392,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The butterfly can see it from afar,"
1393,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Although one summer evening’s dew could fill
1394,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Its little cup twice over ere the star
1395,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Had called the lazy shepherd to his fold
1396,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And be no prodigal; each leaf is flecked with spotted gold
1397,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1398,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,As if Jove’s gorgeous leman Danae
1399,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Hot from his gilded arms had stooped to kiss
1400,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The trembling petals, or young Mercury"
1401,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Low-flying to the dusky ford of Dis
1402,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Had with one feather of his pinions
1403,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Just brushed them! the slight stem which bears the burden of its suns
1404,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1405,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Is hardly thicker than the gossamer,"
1406,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Or poor Arachne’s silver tapestry,—"
1407,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Men say it bloomed upon the sepulchre
1408,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Of One I sometime worshipped, but to me"
1409,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,It seems to bring diviner memories
1410,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Of faun-loved Heliconian glades and blue nymph-haunted seas,"
1411,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1412,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Of an untrodden vale at Tempe where
1413,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"On the clear river’s marge Narcissus lies,"
1414,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The tangle of the forest in his hair,"
1415,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The silence of the woodland in his eyes,"
1416,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Wooing that drifting imagery which is
1417,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,No sooner kissed than broken; memories of Salmacis
1418,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1419,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Who is not boy nor girl and yet is both,"
1420,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Fed by two fires and unsatisfied
1421,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Through their excess, each passion being loth"
1422,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,For love’s own sake to leave the other’s side
1423,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Yet killing love by staying; memories
1424,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Of Oreads peeping through the leaves of silent moonlit trees,"
1425,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1426,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Of lonely Ariadne on the wharf
1427,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"At Naxos, when she saw the treacherous crew"
1428,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Far out at sea, and waved her crimson scarf"
1429,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And called false Theseus back again nor knew
1430,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,That Dionysos on an amber pard
1431,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Was close behind her; memories of what Mæonia’s bard
1432,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1433,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"With sightless eyes beheld, the wall of Troy,"
1434,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Queen Helen lying in the ivory room,"
1435,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And at her side an amorous red-lipped boy
1436,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Trimming with dainty hand his helmet’s plume,"
1437,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"And far away the moil, the shout, the groan,"
1438,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,As Hector shielded off the spear and Ajax hurled the stone;
1439,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1440,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Of wingèd Perseus with his flawless sword
1441,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Cleaving the snaky tresses of the witch,"
1442,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And all those tales imperishably stored
1443,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"In little Grecian urns, freightage more rich"
1444,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Than any gaudy galleon of Spain
1445,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Bare from the Indies ever! these at least bring back again,"
1446,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1447,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"For well I know they are not dead at all,"
1448,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,The ancient Gods of Grecian poesy:
1449,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"They are asleep, and when they hear thee call"
1450,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Will wake and think ’t is very Thessaly,"
1451,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"This Thames the Daulian waters, this cool glade"
1452,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,The yellow-irised mead where once young Itys laughed and played.
1453,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1454,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,If it was thou dear jasmine-cradled bird
1455,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Who from the leafy stillness of thy throne
1456,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Sang to the wondrous boy, until he heard"
1457,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,The horn of Atalanta faintly blown
1458,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Across the Cumnor hills, and wandering"
1459,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Through Bagley wood at evening found the Attic poets’ spring,—"
1460,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1461,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Ah! tiny sober-suited advocate
1462,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,That pleadest for the moon against the day!
1463,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,If thou didst make the shepherd seek his mate
1464,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"On that sweet questing, when Proserpina"
1465,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Forgot it was not Sicily and leant
1466,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Across the mossy Sandford stile in ravished wonderment,—"
1467,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1468,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Light-winged and bright-eyed miracle of the wood!
1469,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,If ever thou didst soothe with melody
1470,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"One of that little clan, that brotherhood"
1471,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Which loved the morning-star of Tuscany
1472,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,More than the perfect sun of Raphael
1473,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"And is immortal, sing to me! for I too love thee well."
1474,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1475,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Sing on! sing on! let the dull world grow young,"
1476,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Let elemental things take form again,"
1477,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And the old shapes of Beauty walk among
1478,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The simple garths and open crofts, as when"
1479,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The son of Leto bare the willow rod,"
1480,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And the soft sheep and shaggy goats followed the boyish God.
1481,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1482,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Sing on! sing on! and Bacchus will be here
1483,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Astride upon his gorgeous Indian throne,"
1484,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And over whimpering tigers shake the spear
1485,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"With yellow ivy crowned and gummy cone,"
1486,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,While at his side the wanton Bassarid
1487,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Will throw the lion by the mane and catch the mountain kid!
1488,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1489,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Sing on! and I will wear the leopard skin,"
1490,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"And steal the moonèd wings of Ashtaroth,"
1491,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Upon whose icy chariot we could win
1492,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Cithæron in an hour ere the froth
1493,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Has over-brimmed the wine-vat or the Faun
1494,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Ceased from the treading! ay, before the flickering lamp of dawn"
1495,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1496,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Has scared the hooting owlet to its nest,"
1497,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"And warned the bat to close its filmy vans,"
1498,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Some Mænad girl with vine-leaves on her breast
1499,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Will filch their beech-nuts from the sleeping Pans
1500,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,So softly that the little nested thrush
1501,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Will never wake, and then with shrilly laugh and leap will rush"
1502,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1503,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Down the green valley where the fallen dew
1504,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Lies thick beneath the elm and count her store,"
1505,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Till the brown Satyrs in a jolly crew
1506,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Trample the loosestrife down along the shore,"
1507,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And where their hornèd master sits in state
1508,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Bring strawberries and bloomy plums upon a wicker crate!
1509,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1510,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Sing on! and soon with passion-wearied face
1511,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Through the cool leaves Apollo’s lad will come,"
1512,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,The Tyrian prince his bristled boar will chase
1513,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Adown the chestnut-copses all a-bloom,"
1514,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"And ivory-limbed, grey-eyed, with look of pride,"
1515,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,After yon velvet-coated deer the virgin maid will ride.
1516,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1517,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Sing on! and I the dying boy will see
1518,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Stain with his purple blood the waxen bell
1519,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"That overweighs the jacinth, and to me"
1520,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The wretched Cyprian her woe will tell,"
1521,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"And I will kiss her mouth and streaming eyes,"
1522,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And lead her to the myrtle-hidden grove where Adon lies!
1523,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1524,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Cry out aloud on Itys! memory
1525,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,That foster-brother of remorse and pain
1526,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Drops poison in mine ear,—O to be free,"
1527,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,To burn one’s old ships! and to launch again
1528,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Into the white-plumed battle of the waves
1529,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And fight old Proteus for the spoil of coral-flowered caves!
1530,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1531,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,O for Medea with her poppied spell!
1532,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,O for the secret of the Colchian shrine!
1533,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,O for one leaf of that pale asphodel
1534,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Which binds the tired brows of Proserpine,"
1535,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And sheds such wondrous dews at eve that she
1536,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Dreams of the fields of Enna, by the far Sicilian sea,"
1537,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1538,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Where oft the golden-girdled bee she chased
1539,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"From lily to lily on the level mead,"
1540,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Ere yet her sombre Lord had bid her taste
1541,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The deadly fruit of that pomegranate seed,"
1542,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Ere the black steeds had harried her away
1543,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Down to the faint and flowerless land, the sick and sunless day."
1544,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1545,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,O for one midnight and as paramour
1546,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,The Venus of the little Melian farm!
1547,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,O that some antique statue for one hour
1548,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Might wake to passion, and that I could charm"
1549,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The Dawn at Florence from its dumb despair,"
1550,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Mix with those mighty limbs and make that giant breast my lair!
1551,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1552,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Sing on! sing on!  I would be drunk with life,"
1553,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Drunk with the trampled vintage of my youth,"
1554,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"I would forget the wearying wasted strife,"
1555,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The riven veil, the Gorgon eyes of Truth,"
1556,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The prayerless vigil and the cry for prayer,"
1557,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The barren gifts, the lifted arms, the dull insensate air!"
1558,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1559,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Sing on! sing on!  O feathered Niobe,"
1560,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Thou canst make sorrow beautiful, and steal"
1561,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"From joy its sweetest music, not as we"
1562,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Who by dead voiceless silence strive to heal
1563,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Our too untented wounds, and do but keep"
1564,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Pain barricadoed in our hearts, and murder pillowed sleep."
1565,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1566,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Sing louder yet, why must I still behold"
1567,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The wan white face of that deserted Christ,"
1568,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Whose bleeding hands my hands did once enfold,"
1569,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Whose smitten lips my lips so oft have kissed,"
1570,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And now in mute and marble misery
1571,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Sits in his lone dishonoured House and weeps, perchance for me?"
1572,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1573,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,O Memory cast down thy wreathèd shell!
1574,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Break thy hoarse lute O sad Melpomene!
1575,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"O Sorrow, Sorrow keep thy cloistered cell"
1576,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Nor dim with tears this limpid Castaly!
1577,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Cease, Philomel, thou dost the forest wrong"
1578,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,To vex its sylvan quiet with such wild impassioned song!
1579,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1580,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Cease, cease, or if ’t is anguish to be dumb"
1581,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Take from the pastoral thrush her simpler air,"
1582,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Whose jocund carelessness doth more become
1583,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"This English woodland than thy keen despair,"
1584,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Ah! cease and let the north wind bear thy lay
1585,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Back to the rocky hills of Thrace, the stormy Daulian bay."
1586,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1587,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"A moment more, the startled leaves had stirred,"
1588,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Endymion would have passed across the mead
1589,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Moonstruck with love, and this still Thames had heard"
1590,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Pan plash and paddle groping for some reed
1591,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,To lure from her blue cave that Naiad maid
1592,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Who for such piping listens half in joy and half afraid.
1593,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1594,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"A moment more, the waking dove had cooed,"
1595,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,The silver daughter of the silver sea
1596,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,With the fond gyves of clinging hands had wooed
1597,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Her wanton from the chase, and Dryope"
1598,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Had thrust aside the branches of her oak
1599,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,To see the lusty gold-haired lad rein in his snorting yoke.
1600,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1601,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"A moment more, the trees had stooped to kiss"
1602,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Pale Daphne just awakening from the swoon
1603,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Of tremulous laurels, lonely Salmacis"
1604,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Had bared his barren beauty to the moon,"
1605,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And through the vale with sad voluptuous smile
1606,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Antinous had wandered, the red lotus of the Nile"
1607,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1608,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Down leaning from his black and clustering hair,"
1609,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"To shade those slumberous eyelids’ caverned bliss,"
1610,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Or else on yonder grassy slope with bare
1611,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,High-tuniced limbs unravished Artemis
1612,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Had bade her hounds give tongue, and roused the deer"
1613,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,From his green ambuscade with shrill halloo and pricking spear.
1614,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1615,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Lie still, lie still, O passionate heart, lie still!"
1616,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"O Melancholy, fold thy raven wing!"
1617,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"O sobbing Dryad, from thy hollow hill"
1618,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Come not with such despondent answering!
1619,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"No more thou wingèd Marsyas complain,"
1620,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Apollo loveth not to hear such troubled songs of pain!
1621,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1622,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"It was a dream, the glade is tenantless,"
1623,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"No soft Ionian laughter moves the air,"
1624,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The Thames creeps on in sluggish leadenness,"
1625,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And from the copse left desolate and bare
1626,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Fled is young Bacchus with his revelry,"
1627,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Yet still from Nuneham wood there comes that thrilling melody
1628,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1629,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"So sad, that one might think a human heart"
1630,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Brake in each separate note, a quality"
1631,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Which music sometimes has, being the Art"
1632,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Which is most nigh to tears and memory;
1633,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Poor mourning Philomel, what dost thou fear?"
1634,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Thy sister doth not haunt these fields, Pandion is not here,"
1635,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1636,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Here is no cruel Lord with murderous blade,"
1637,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"No woven web of bloody heraldries,"
1638,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"But mossy dells for roving comrades made,"
1639,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Warm valleys where the tired student lies
1640,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"With half-shut book, and many a winding walk"
1641,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Where rustic lovers stray at eve in happy simple talk.
1642,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1643,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,The harmless rabbit gambols with its young
1644,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Across the trampled towing-path, where late"
1645,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,A troop of laughing boys in jostling throng
1646,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Cheered with their noisy cries the racing eight;
1647,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The gossamer, with ravelled silver threads,"
1648,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Works at its little loom, and from the dusky red-eaved sheds"
1649,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1650,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Of the lone Farm a flickering light shines out
1651,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Where the swinked shepherd drives his bleating flock
1652,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Back to their wattled sheep-cotes, a faint shout"
1653,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Comes from some Oxford boat at Sandford lock,"
1654,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"And starts the moor-hen from the sedgy rill,"
1655,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And the dim lengthening shadows flit like swallows up the hill.
1656,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1657,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The heron passes homeward to the mere,"
1658,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"The blue mist creeps among the shivering trees,"
1659,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Gold world by world the silent stars appear,"
1660,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,And like a blossom blown before the breeze
1661,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"A white moon drifts across the shimmering sky,"
1662,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Mute arbitress of all thy sad, thy rapturous threnody."
1663,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1664,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"She does not heed thee, wherefore should she heed,"
1665,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,She knows Endymion is not far away;
1666,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"’Tis I, ’tis I, whose soul is as the reed"
1667,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Which has no message of its own to play,"
1668,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"So pipes another’s bidding, it is I,"
1669,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Drifting with every wind on the wide sea of misery.
1670,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1671,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Ah! the brown bird has ceased: one exquisite trill
1672,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,About the sombre woodland seems to cling
1673,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Dying in music, else the air is still,"
1674,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,So still that one might hear the bat’s small wing
1675,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Wander and wheel above the pines, or tell"
1676,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Each tiny dew-drop dripping from the bluebell’s brimming cell.
1677,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,
1678,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"And far away across the lengthening wold,"
1679,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Across the willowy flats and thickets brown,"
1680,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Magdalen’s tall tower tipped with tremulous gold
1681,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"Marks the long High Street of the little town,"
1682,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,"And warns me to return; I must not wait,"
1683,THE BURDEN OF ITYS,Hark! ’t is the curfew booming from the bell at Christ Church gate.

1696,IMPRESSION DU MATIN,Dropt from the wharf: and chill and cold
1697,IMPRESSION DU MATIN,
1698,IMPRESSION DU MATIN,The yellow fog came creeping down
1699,IMPRESSION DU MATIN,"The bridges, till the houses’ walls"

1746,ATHANASIA,TO that gaunt House of Art which lacks for naught
1747,ATHANASIA,"Of all the great things men have saved from Time,"
1748,ATHANASIA,The withered body of a girl was brought
1749,ATHANASIA,"Dead ere the world’s glad youth had touched its prime,"
1750,ATHANASIA,And seen by lonely Arabs lying hid
1751,ATHANASIA,In the dim womb of some black pyramid.
1752,ATHANASIA,
1753,ATHANASIA,But when they had unloosed the linen band
1754,ATHANASIA,"Which swathed the Egyptian’s body,—lo! was found"
1755,ATHANASIA,Closed in the wasted hollow of her hand
1756,ATHANASIA,"A little seed, which sown in English ground"
1757,ATHANASIA,Did wondrous snow of starry blossoms bear
1758,ATHANASIA,And spread rich odours through our spring-tide air.
1759,ATHANASIA,
1760,ATHANASIA,With such strange arts this flower did allure
1761,ATHANASIA,"That all forgotten was the asphodel,"
1762,ATHANASIA,"And the brown bee, the lily’s paramour,"
1763,ATHANASIA,"Forsook the cup where he was wont to dwell,"

1767,ATHANASIA,"In vain the sad narcissus, wan and white"

1770,ATHANASIA,"With its gold dust to make his wings a-gleam,"
1771,ATHANASIA,"Ah! no delight the jasmine-bloom to kiss,"

1773,ATHANASIA,
1774,ATHANASIA,For love of it the passionate nightingale
1775,ATHANASIA,"Forgot the hills of Thrace, the cruel king,"
1776,ATHANASIA,And the pale dove no longer cared to sail
1777,ATHANASIA,"Through the wet woods at time of blossoming,"
1778,ATHANASIA,"But round this flower of Egypt sought to float,"
1779,ATHANASIA,With silvered wing and amethystine throat.
1780,ATHANASIA,
1781,ATHANASIA,While the hot sun blazed in his tower of blue
1782,ATHANASIA,"A cooling wind crept from the land of snows,"
1783,ATHANASIA,And the warm south with tender tears of dew
1784,ATHANASIA,Drenched its white leaves when Hesperos up-rose

1788,ATHANASIA,But when o’er wastes of lily-haunted field
1789,ATHANASIA,"The tired birds had stayed their amorous tune,"
1790,ATHANASIA,And broad and glittering like an argent shield
1791,ATHANASIA,"High in the sapphire heavens hung the moon,"

1793,ATHANASIA,Each tremulous petal of its blossoms shake?
1794,ATHANASIA,
1795,ATHANASIA,Ah no! to this bright flower a thousand years
1796,ATHANASIA,"Seemed but the lingering of a summer’s day,"
1797,ATHANASIA,It never knew the tide of cankering fears
1798,ATHANASIA,"Which turn a boy’s gold hair to withered grey,"
1799,ATHANASIA,"The dread desire of death it never knew,"
1800,ATHANASIA,Or how all folk that they were born must rue.
1801,ATHANASIA,
1802,ATHANASIA,"For we to death with pipe and dancing go,"
1803,ATHANASIA,"Nor would we pass the ivory gate again,"
1804,ATHANASIA,As some sad river wearied of its flow
1805,ATHANASIA,"Through the dull plains, the haunts of common men,"
1806,ATHANASIA,Leaps lover-like into the terrible sea!
1807,ATHANASIA,And counts it gain to die so gloriously.
1808,ATHANASIA,
1809,ATHANASIA,We mar our lordly strength in barren strife
1810,ATHANASIA,"With the world’s legions led by clamorous care,"
1811,ATHANASIA,It never feels decay but gathers life
1812,ATHANASIA,"From the pure sunlight and the supreme air,"

1814,ATHANASIA,It is the child of all eternity.

2127,I.,A little space he let his greedy eyes
2128,I.,"Rest on the burnished image, till mere sight"
2129,I.,"Half swooned for surfeit of such luxuries,"
2130,I.,And then his lips in hungering delight
2131,I.,"Fed on her lips, and round the towered neck"
2132,I.,"He flung his arms, nor cared at all his passion’s will to check."
2133,I.,
2134,I.,"Never I ween did lover hold such tryst,"
2135,I.,"For all night long he murmured honeyed word,"
2136,I.,"And saw her sweet unravished limbs, and kissed"
2137,I.,"Her pale and argent body undisturbed,"
2138,I.,"And paddled with the polished throat, and pressed"
2139,I.,His hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.
2140,I.,
2141,I.,It was as if Numidian javelins
2142,I.,"Pierced through and through his wild and whirling brain,"
2143,I.,And his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins
2144,I.,"In exquisite pulsation, and the pain"
2145,I.,Was such sweet anguish that he never drew
2146,I.,His lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew.
2147,I.,
2148,I.,They who have never seen the daylight peer
2149,I.,"Into a darkened room, and drawn the curtain,"
2150,I.,And with dull eyes and wearied from some dear
2151,I.,"And worshipped body risen, they for certain"
2152,I.,"Will never know of what I try to sing,"
2153,I.,"How long the last kiss was, how fond and late his lingering."
2154,I.,
2155,I.,"The moon was girdled with a crystal rim,"
2156,I.,The sign which shipmen say is ominous
2157,I.,"Of wrath in heaven, the wan stars were dim,"
2158,I.,And the low lightening east was tremulous
2159,I.,"With the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn,"
2160,I.,Ere from the silent sombre shrine his lover had withdrawn.
2161,I.,
2162,I.,Down the steep rock with hurried feet and fast
2163,I.,"Clomb the brave lad, and reached the cave of Pan,"
2164,I.,"And heard the goat-foot snoring as he passed,"
2165,I.,And leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran
2166,I.,Like a young fawn unto an olive wood
2167,I.,Which in a shady valley by the well-built city stood;
2168,I.,
2169,I.,"And sought a little stream, which well he knew,"
2170,I.,For oftentimes with boyish careless shout
2171,I.,"The green and crested grebe he would pursue,"
2172,I.,"Or snare in woven net the silver trout,"
2173,I.,And down amid the startled reeds he lay
2174,I.,"Panting in breathless sweet affright, and waited for the day."
2175,I.,
2176,I.,"On the green bank he lay, and let one hand"
2177,I.,"Dip in the cool dark eddies listlessly,"
2178,I.,And soon the breath of morning came and fanned
2179,I.,"His hot flushed cheeks, or lifted wantonly"
2180,I.,"The tangled curls from off his forehead, while"
2181,I.,He on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile.
2182,I.,
2183,I.,And soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak
2184,I.,"With his long crook undid the wattled cotes,"
2185,I.,And from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke
2186,I.,"Curled through the air across the ripening oats,"
2187,I.,And on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed
2188,I.,As through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle strayed.
2189,I.,
2190,I.,And when the light-foot mower went afield
2191,I.,"Across the meadows laced with threaded dew,"
2192,I.,"And the sheep bleated on the misty weald,"
2193,I.,"And from its nest the waking corncrake flew,"
2194,I.,Some woodmen saw him lying by the stream
2195,I.,"And marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,"
2196,I.,
2197,I.,"Nor deemed him born of mortals, and one said,"
2198,I.,"‘It is young Hylas, that false runaway"
2199,I.,Who with a Naiad now would make his bed
2200,I.,"Forgetting Herakles,’ but others, ‘Nay,"
2201,I.,"It is Narcissus, his own paramour,"
2202,I.,Those are the fond and crimson lips no woman can allure.’
2203,I.,
2204,I.,"And when they nearer came a third one cried,"
2205,I.,‘It is young Dionysos who has hid
2206,I.,His spear and fawnskin by the river side
2207,I.,"Weary of hunting with the Bassarid,"
2208,I.,And wise indeed were we away to fly:
2209,I.,They live not long who on the gods immortal come to spy.’
2210,I.,
2211,I.,"So turned they back, and feared to look behind,"
2212,I.,And told the timid swain how they had seen
2213,I.,"Amid the reeds some woodland god reclined,"
2214,I.,"And no man dared to cross the open green,"
2215,I.,"And on that day no olive-tree was slain,"
2216,I.,"Nor rushes cut, but all deserted was the fair domain,"
2217,I.,
2218,I.,"Save when the neat-herd’s lad, his empty pail"
2219,I.,"Well slung upon his back, with leap and bound"
2220,I.,"Raced on the other side, and stopped to hail,"
2221,I.,"Hoping that he some comrade new had found,"
2222,I.,"And gat no answer, and then half afraid"
2223,I.,"Passed on his simple way, or down the still and silent glade"
2224,I.,
2225,I.,"A little girl ran laughing from the farm,"
2226,I.,"Not thinking of love’s secret mysteries,"
2227,I.,And when she saw the white and gleaming arm
2228,I.,"And all his manlihood, with longing eyes"
2229,I.,Whose passion mocked her sweet virginity
2230,I.,"Watched him awhile, and then stole back sadly and wearily."
2231,I.,
2232,I.,"Far off he heard the city’s hum and noise,"
2233,I.,And now and then the shriller laughter where
2234,I.,The passionate purity of brown-limbed boys
2235,I.,"Wrestled or raced in the clear healthful air,"
2236,I.,And now and then a little tinkling bell
2237,I.,As the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.
2238,I.,
2239,I.,"Through the grey willows danced the fretful gnat,"
2240,I.,"The grasshopper chirped idly from the tree,"
2241,I.,In sleek and oily coat the water-rat
2242,I.,Breasting the little ripples manfully
2243,I.,"Made for the wild-duck’s nest, from bough to bough"
2244,I.,"Hopped the shy finch, and the huge tortoise crept across the slough."
2245,I.,
2246,I.,On the faint wind floated the silky seeds
2247,I.,"As the bright scythe swept through the waving grass,"
2248,I.,The ouzel-cock splashed circles in the reeds
2249,I.,"And flecked with silver whorls the forest’s glass,"
2250,I.,Which scarce had caught again its imagery
2251,I.,Ere from its bed the dusky tench leapt at the dragon-fly.
2252,I.,
2253,I.,But little care had he for any thing
2254,I.,"Though up and down the beech the squirrel played,"
2255,I.,And from the copse the linnet ’gan to sing
2256,I.,To its brown mate its sweetest serenade;
2257,I.,"Ah! little care indeed, for he had seen"
2258,I.,The breasts of Pallas and the naked wonder of the Queen.
2259,I.,
2260,I.,But when the herdsman called his straggling goats
2261,I.,"With whistling pipe across the rocky road,"
2262,I.,And the shard-beetle with its trumpet-notes
2263,I.,"Boomed through the darkening woods, and seemed to bode"
2264,I.,"Of coming storm, and the belated crane"
2265,I.,"Passed homeward like a shadow, and the dull big drops of rain"
2266,I.,
2267,I.,"Fell on the pattering fig-leaves, up he rose,"
2268,I.,And from the gloomy forest went his way
2269,I.,"Past sombre homestead and wet orchard-close,"
2270,I.,"And came at last unto a little quay,"
2271,I.,"And called his mates aboard, and took his seat"
2272,I.,"On the high poop, and pushed from land, and loosed the dripping sheet,"
2273,I.,
2274,I.,"And steered across the bay, and when nine suns"
2275,I.,"Passed down the long and laddered way of gold,"
2276,I.,And nine pale moons had breathed their orisons
2277,I.,"To the chaste stars their confessors, or told"
2278,I.,Their dearest secret to the downy moth
2279,I.,"That will not fly at noonday, through the foam and surging froth"
2280,I.,
2281,I.,Came a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes
2282,I.,"And lit upon the ship, whose timbers creaked"
2283,I.,As though the lading of three argosies
2284,I.,"Were in the hold, and flapped its wings and shrieked,"
2285,I.,"And darkness straightway stole across the deep,"
2286,I.,"Sheathed was Orion’s sword, dread Mars himself fled down the steep,"
2287,I.,
2288,I.,And the moon hid behind a tawny mask
2289,I.,"Of drifting cloud, and from the ocean’s marge"
2290,I.,"Rose the red plume, the huge and hornèd casque,"
2291,I.,"The seven-cubit spear, the brazen targe!"
2292,I.,And clad in bright and burnished panoply
2293,I.,Athena strode across the stretch of sick and shivering sea!
2294,I.,
2295,I.,To the dull sailors’ sight her loosened looks
2296,I.,"Seemed like the jagged storm-rack, and her feet"
2297,I.,"Only the spume that floats on hidden rocks,"
2298,I.,"And, marking how the rising waters beat"
2299,I.,"Against the rolling ship, the pilot cried"
2300,I.,To the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side
2301,I.,
2302,I.,"But he, the overbold adulterer,"
2303,I.,"A dear profaner of great mysteries,"
2304,I.,"An ardent amorous idolater,"
2305,I.,When he beheld those grand relentless eyes
2306,I.,"Laughed loud for joy, and crying out ‘I come’"
2307,I.,Leapt from the lofty poop into the chill and churning foam.
2308,I.,
2309,I.,"Then fell from the high heaven one bright star,"
2310,I.,"One dancer left the circling galaxy,"
2311,I.,And back to Athens on her clattering car
2312,I.,In all the pride of venged divinity
2313,I.,"Pale Pallas swept with shrill and steely clank,"
2314,I.,And a few gurgling bubbles rose where her boy lover sank.
2315,I.,
2316,I.,And the mast shuddered as the gaunt owl flew
2317,I.,"With mocking hoots after the wrathful Queen,"
2318,I.,And the old pilot bade the trembling crew
2319,I.,"Hoist the big sail, and told how he had seen"
2320,I.,"Close to the stern a dim and giant form,"
2321,I.,And like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm.
2322,I.,
2323,I.,And no man dared to speak of Charmides
2324,I.,"Deeming that he some evil thing had wrought,"
2325,I.,And when they reached the strait Symplegades
2326,I.,"They beached their galley on the shore, and sought"
2327,I.,"The toll-gate of the city hastily,"
2328,I.,And in the market showed their brown and pictured pottery.
2329,I.,
2330,II.,II.
2331,II.,
2332,II.,"BUT some good Triton-god had ruth, and bare"
2333,II.,"The boy’s drowned body back to Grecian land,"
2334,II.,And mermaids combed his dank and dripping hair
2335,II.,"And smoothed his brow, and loosed his clenching hand;"
2336,II.,"Some brought sweet spices from far Araby,"
2337,II.,And others bade the halcyon sing her softest lullaby.
2338,II.,
2339,II.,"And when he neared his old Athenian home,"
2340,II.,A mighty billow rose up suddenly
2341,II.,Upon whose oily back the clotted foam
2342,II.,"Lay diapered in some strange fantasy,"
2343,II.,And clasping him unto its glassy breast
2344,II.,"Swept landward, like a white-maned steed upon a venturous quest!"
2345,II.,
2346,II.,Now where Colonos leans unto the sea
2347,II.,There lies a long and level stretch of lawn;
2348,II.,"The rabbit knows it, and the mountain bee"
2349,II.,"For it deserts Hymettus, and the Faun"
2350,II.,"Is not afraid, for never through the day"
2351,II.,Comes a cry ruder than the shout of shepherd lads at play.
2352,II.,
2353,II.,But often from the thorny labyrinth
2354,II.,And tangled branches of the circling wood
2355,II.,The stealthy hunter sees young Hyacinth
2356,II.,"Hurling the polished disk, and draws his hood"
2357,II.,"Over his guilty gaze, and creeps away,"
2358,II.,"Nor dares to wind his horn, or—else at the first break of day"
2359,II.,
2360,II.,The Dryads come and throw the leathern ball
2361,II.,"Along the reedy shore, and circumvent"
2362,II.,Some goat-eared Pan to be their seneschal
2363,II.,"For fear of bold Poseidon’s ravishment,"
2364,II.,"And loose their girdles, with shy timorous eyes,"
2365,II.,Lest from the surf his azure arms and purple beard should rise.
2366,II.,
2367,II.,"On this side and on that a rocky cave,"
2368,II.,"Hung with the yellow-belled laburnum, stands"
2369,II.,"Smooth is the beach, save where some ebbing wave"
2370,II.,"Leaves its faint outline etched upon the sands,"
2371,II.,As though it feared to be too soon forgot
2372,II.,"By the green rush, its playfellow,—and yet, it is a spot"
2373,II.,
2374,II.,"So small, that the inconstant butterfly"
2375,II.,Could steal the hoarded money from each flower
2376,II.,"Ere it was noon, and still not satisfy"
2377,II.,"Its over-greedy love,—within an hour"
2378,II.,"A sailor boy, were he but rude enow"
2379,II.,"To land and pluck a garland for his galley’s painted prow,"
2380,II.,
2381,II.,"Would almost leave the little meadow bare,"
2382,II.,"For it knows nothing of great pageantry,"
2383,II.,Only a few narcissi here and there
2384,II.,"Stand separate in sweet austerity,"
2385,II.,"Dotting the unmown grass with silver stars,"
2386,II.,And here and there a daffodil waves tiny scimitars.
2387,II.,
2388,II.,"Hither the billow brought him, and was glad"
2389,II.,"Of such dear servitude, and where the land"
2390,II.,Was virgin of all waters laid the lad
2391,II.,"Upon the golden margent of the strand,"
2392,II.,And like a lingering lover oft returned
2393,II.,"To kiss those pallid limbs which once with intense fire burned,"
2394,II.,
2395,II.,"Ere the wet seas had quenched that holocaust,"
2396,II.,"That self-fed flame, that passionate lustihead,"
2397,II.,Ere grisly death with chill and nipping frost
2398,II.,Had withered up those lilies white and red
2399,II.,"Which, while the boy would through the forest range,"
2400,II.,Answered each other in a sweet antiphonal counter-change.
2401,II.,
2402,II.,"And when at dawn the wood-nymphs, hand-in-hand,"
2403,II.,"Threaded the bosky dell, their satyr spied"
2404,II.,"The boy’s pale body stretched upon the sand,"
2405,II.,"And feared Poseidon’s treachery, and cried,"
2406,II.,And like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade
2407,II.,Each startled Dryad sought some safe and leafy ambuscade.
2408,II.,
2409,II.,"Save one white girl, who deemed it would not be"
2410,II.,So dread a thing to feel a sea-god’s arms
2411,II.,"Crushing her breasts in amorous tyranny,"
2412,II.,And longed to listen to those subtle charms
2413,II.,Insidious lovers weave when they would win
2414,II.,"Some fencèd fortress, and stole back again, nor thought it sin"
2415,II.,
2416,II.,"To yield her treasure unto one so fair,"
2417,II.,"And lay beside him, thirsty with love’s drouth,"
2418,II.,"Called him soft names, played with his tangled hair,"
2419,II.,And with hot lips made havoc of his mouth
2420,II.,"Afraid he might not wake, and then afraid"
2421,II.,"Lest he might wake too soon, fled back, and then, fond renegade,"
2422,II.,
2423,II.,"Returned to fresh assault, and all day long"
2424,II.,"Sat at his side, and laughed at her new toy,"
2425,II.,"And held his hand, and sang her sweetest song,"
2426,II.,Then frowned to see how froward was the boy
2427,II.,"Who would not with her maidenhood entwine,"
2428,II.,Nor knew that three days since his eyes had looked on Proserpine;
2429,II.,
2430,II.,"Nor knew what sacrilege his lips had done,"
2431,II.,"But said, ‘He will awake, I know him well,"
2432,II.,He will awake at evening when the sun
2433,II.,Hangs his red shield on Corinth’s citadel;
2434,II.,This sleep is but a cruel treachery
2435,II.,"To make me love him more, and in some cavern of the sea"
2436,II.,
2437,II.,Deeper than ever falls the fisher’s line
2438,II.,"Already a huge Triton blows his horn,"
2439,II.,And weaves a garland from the crystalline
2440,II.,And drifting ocean-tendrils to adorn
2441,II.,"The emerald pillars of our bridal bed,"
2442,II.,"For sphered in foaming silver, and with coral crownèd head,"
2443,II.,
2444,II.,"We two will sit upon a throne of pearl,"
2445,II.,"And a blue wave will be our canopy,"
2446,II.,And at our feet the water-snakes will curl
2447,II.,In all their amethystine panoply
2448,II.,"Of diamonded mail, and we will mark"
2449,II.,"The mullets swimming by the mast of some storm-foundered bark,"
2450,II.,
2451,II.,Vermilion-finned with eyes of bossy gold
2452,II.,"Like flakes of crimson light, and the great deep"
2453,II.,"His glassy-portaled chamber will unfold,"
2454,II.,And we will see the painted dolphins sleep
2455,II.,Cradled by murmuring halcyons on the rocks
2456,II.,Where Proteus in quaint suit of green pastures his monstrous flocks.
2457,II.,
2458,II.,And tremulous opal-hued anemones
2459,II.,Will wave their purple fringes where we tread
2460,II.,"Upon the mirrored floor, and argosies"
2461,II.,Of fishes flecked with tawny scales will thread
2462,II.,"The drifting cordage of the shattered wreck,"
2463,II.,And honey-coloured amber beads our twining limbs will deck.’
2464,II.,
2465,II.,But when that baffled Lord of War the Sun
2466,II.,With gaudy pennon flying passed away
2467,II.,"Into his brazen House, and one by one"
2468,II.,The little yellow stars began to stray
2469,II.,"Across the field of heaven, ah! then indeed"
2470,II.,"She feared his lips upon her lips would never care to feed,"
2471,II.,
2472,II.,"And cried, ‘Awake, already the pale moon"
2473,II.,"Washes the trees with silver, and the wave"
2474,II.,"Creeps grey and chilly up this sandy dune,"
2475,II.,"The croaking frogs are out, and from the cave"
2476,II.,"The nightjar shrieks, the fluttering bats repass,"
2477,II.,And the brown stoat with hollow flanks creeps through the dusky grass.
2478,II.,
2479,II.,"Nay, though thou art a god, be not so coy,"
2480,II.,For in yon stream there is a little reed
2481,II.,That often whispers how a lovely boy
2482,II.,"Lay with her once upon a grassy mead,"
2483,II.,Who when his cruel pleasure he had done
2484,II.,Spread wings of rustling gold and soared aloft into the sun.
2485,II.,
2486,II.,"Be not so coy, the laurel trembles still"
2487,II.,"With great Apollo’s kisses, and the fir"
2488,II.,Whose clustering sisters fringe the seaward hill
2489,II.,Hath many a tale of that bold ravisher
2490,II.,"Whom men call Boreas, and I have seen"
2491,II.,The mocking eyes of Hermes through the poplar’s silvery sheen.
2492,II.,
2493,II.,"Even the jealous Naiads call me fair,"
2494,II.,And every morn a young and ruddy swain
2495,II.,"Woos me with apples and with locks of hair,"
2496,II.,And seeks to soothe my virginal disdain
2497,II.,By all the gifts the gentle wood-nymphs love;
2498,II.,But yesterday he brought to me an iris-plumaged dove
2499,II.,
2500,II.,"With little crimson feet, which with its store"
2501,II.,Of seven spotted eggs the cruel lad
2502,II.,Had stolen from the lofty sycamore
2503,II.,"At daybreak, when her amorous comrade had"
2504,II.,Flown off in search of berried juniper
2505,II.,"Which most they love; the fretful wasp, that earliest vintager"
2506,II.,
2507,II.,"Of the blue grapes, hath not persistency"
2508,II.,So constant as this simple shepherd-boy
2509,II.,"For my poor lips, his joyous purity"
2510,II.,And laughing sunny eyes might well decoy
2511,II.,A Dryad from her oath to Artemis;
2512,II.,"For very beautiful is he, his mouth was made to kiss;"
2513,II.,
2514,II.,"His argent forehead, like a rising moon"
2515,II.,"Over the dusky hills of meeting brows,"
2516,II.,"Is crescent shaped, the hot and Tyrian noon"
2517,II.,Leads from the myrtle-grove no goodlier spouse
2518,II.,"For Cytheræa, the first silky down"
2519,II.,"Fringes his blushing cheeks, and his young limbs are strong and brown;"
2520,II.,
2521,II.,"And he is rich, and fat and fleecy herds"
2522,II.,"Of bleating sheep upon his meadows lie,"
2523,II.,And many an earthen bowl of yellow curds
2524,II.,Is in his homestead for the thievish fly
2525,II.,"To swim and drown in, the pink clover mead"
2526,II.,"Keeps its sweet store for him, and he can pipe on oaten reed."
2527,II.,
2528,II.,And yet I love him not; it was for thee
2529,II.,I kept my love; I knew that thou would’st come
2530,II.,"To rid me of this pallid chastity,"
2531,II.,Thou fairest flower of the flowerless foam
2532,II.,"Of all the wide Ægean, brightest star"
2533,II.,Of ocean’s azure heavens where the mirrored planets are!
2534,II.,
2535,II.,"I knew that thou would’st come, for when at first"
2536,II.,"The dry wood burgeoned, and the sap of spring"
2537,II.,Swelled in my green and tender bark or burst
2538,II.,To myriad multitudinous blossoming
2539,II.,Which mocked the midnight with its mimic moons
2540,II.,"That did not dread the dawn, and first the thrushes’ rapturous tunes"
2541,II.,
2542,II.,"Startled the squirrel from its granary,"
2543,II.,"And cuckoo flowers fringed the narrow lane,"
2544,II.,Through my young leaves a sensuous ecstasy
2545,II.,"Crept like new wine, and every mossy vein"
2546,II.,"Throbbed with the fitful pulse of amorous blood,"
2547,II.,And the wild winds of passion shook my slim stem’s maidenhood.
2548,II.,
2549,II.,The trooping fawns at evening came and laid
2550,II.,"Their cool black noses on my lowest boughs,"
2551,II.,And on my topmost branch the blackbird made
2552,II.,"A little nest of grasses for his spouse,"
2553,II.,And now and then a twittering wren would light
2554,II.,On a thin twig which hardly bare the weight of such delight.
2555,II.,
2556,II.,"I was the Attic shepherd’s trysting place,"
2557,II.,"Beneath my shadow Amaryllis lay,"
2558,II.,And round my trunk would laughing Daphnis chase
2559,II.,"The timorous girl, till tired out with play"
2560,II.,"She felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair,"
2561,II.,"And turned, and looked, and fled no more from such delightful snare."
2562,II.,
2563,II.,Then come away unto my ambuscade
2564,II.,Where clustering woodbine weaves a canopy
2565,II.,"For amorous pleasaunce, and the rustling shade"
2566,II.,Of Paphian myrtles seems to sanctify
2567,II.,The dearest rites of love; there in the cool
2568,II.,"And green recesses of its farthest depth there is pool,"
2569,II.,
2570,II.,"The ouzel’s haunt, the wild bee’s pasturage,"
2571,II.,For round its rim great creamy lilies float
2572,II.,"Through their flat leaves in verdant anchorage,"
2573,II.,Each cup a white-sailed golden-laden boat
2574,II.,"Steered by a dragon-fly,—be not afraid"
2575,II.,"To leave this wan and wave-kissed shore, surely the place was made"
2576,II.,
2577,II.,"For lovers such as we; the Cyprian Queen,"
2578,II.,"One arm around her boyish paramour,"
2579,II.,"Strays often there at eve, and I have seen"
2580,II.,The moon strip off her misty vestiture
2581,II.,"For young Endymion’s eyes; be not afraid,"
2582,II.,The panther feet of Dian never tread that secret glade.
2583,II.,
2584,II.,"Nay if thou will’st, back to the beating brine,"
2585,II.,"Back to the boisterous billow let us go,"
2586,II.,And walk all day beneath the hyaline
2587,II.,"Huge vault of Neptune’s watery portico,"
2588,II.,And watch the purple monsters of the deep
2589,II.,"Sport in ungainly play, and from his lair keen Xiphias leap."
2590,II.,
2591,II.,For if my mistress find me lying here
2592,II.,"She will not ruth or gentle pity show,"
2593,II.,"But lay her boar-spear down, and with austere"
2594,II.,"Relentless fingers string the cornel bow,"
2595,II.,"And draw the feathered notch against her breast,"
2596,II.,"And loose the archèd cord; aye, even now upon the quest"
2597,II.,
2598,II.,"I hear her hurrying feet,—awake, awake,"
2599,II.,Thou laggard in love’s battle! once at least
2600,II.,"Let me drink deep of passion’s wine, and slake"
2601,II.,My parchèd being with the nectarous feast
2602,II.,"Which even gods affect!  O come, Love, come,"
2603,II.,Still we have time to reach the cavern of thine azure home.’
2604,II.,
2605,II.,Scarce had she spoken when the shuddering trees
2606,II.,"Shook, and the leaves divided, and the air"
2607,II.,"Grew conscious of a god, and the grey seas"
2608,II.,"Crawled backward, and a long and dismal blare"
2609,II.,"Blew from some tasselled horn, a sleuth-hound bayed,"
2610,II.,And like a flame a barbèd reed flew whizzing down the glade.
2611,II.,
2612,II.,And where the little flowers of her breast
2613,II.,"Just brake into their milky blossoming,"
2614,II.,"This murderous paramour, this unbidden guest,"
2615,II.,"Pierced and struck deep in horrid chambering,"
2616,II.,"And ploughed a bloody furrow with its dart,"
2617,II.,"And dug a long red road, and cleft with wingèd death her heart."
2618,II.,
2619,II.,Sobbing her life out with a bitter cry
2620,II.,"On the boy’s body fell the Dryad maid,"
2621,II.,"Sobbing for incomplete virginity,"
2622,II.,"And raptures unenjoyed, and pleasures dead,"
2623,II.,"And all the pain of things unsatisfied,"
2624,II.,And the bright drops of crimson youth crept down her throbbing side.
2625,II.,
2626,II.,"Ah! pitiful it was to hear her moan,"
2627,II.,And very pitiful to see her die
2628,II.,"Ere she had yielded up her sweets, or known"
2629,II.,"The joy of passion, that dread mystery"
2630,II.,"Which not to know is not to live at all,"
2631,II.,And yet to know is to be held in death’s most deadly thrall.
2632,II.,
2633,II.,"But as it hapt the Queen of Cythere,"
2634,II.,Who with Adonis all night long had lain
2635,II.,"Within some shepherd’s hut in Arcady,"
2636,II.,On team of silver doves and gilded wain
2637,II.,"Was journeying Paphos-ward, high up afar"
2638,II.,"From mortal ken between the mountains and the morning star,"
2639,II.,
2640,II.,"And when low down she spied the hapless pair,"
2641,II.,"And heard the Oread’s faint despairing cry,"
2642,II.,Whose cadence seemed to play upon the air
2643,II.,"As though it were a viol, hastily"
2644,II.,"She bade her pigeons fold each straining plume,"
2645,II.,"And dropt to earth, and reached the strand, and saw their dolorous"
2646,II.,doom.
2647,II.,
2648,II.,For as a gardener turning back his head
2649,II.,"To catch the last notes of the linnet, mows"
2650,II.,"With careless scythe too near some flower bed,"
2651,II.,"And cuts the thorny pillar of the rose,"
2652,II.,And with the flower’s loosened loneliness
2653,II.,Strews the brown mould; or as some shepherd lad in wantonness
2654,II.,
2655,II.,Driving his little flock along the mead
2656,II.,"Treads down two daffodils, which side by aide"
2657,II.,Have lured the lady-bird with yellow brede
2658,II.,"And made the gaudy moth forget its pride,"
2659,II.,Treads down their brimming golden chalices
2660,II.,Under light feet which were not made for such rude ravages;
2661,II.,
2662,II.,Or as a schoolboy tired of his book
2663,II.,Flings himself down upon the reedy grass
2664,II.,"And plucks two water-lilies from the brook,"
2665,II.,"And for a time forgets the hour glass,"
2666,II.,"Then wearies of their sweets, and goes his way,"
2667,II.,"And lets the hot sun kill them, even go these lovers lay."
2668,II.,
2669,II.,"And Venus cried, ‘It is dread Artemis"
2670,II.,"Whose bitter hand hath wrought this cruelty,"
2671,II.,Or else that mightier maid whose care it is
2672,II.,To guard her strong and stainless majesty
2673,II.,"Upon the hill Athenian,—alas!"
2674,II.,That they who loved so well unloved into Death’s house should pass.’
2675,II.,
2676,II.,So with soft hands she laid the boy and girl
2677,II.,In the great golden waggon tenderly
2678,II.,(Her white throat whiter than a moony pearl
2679,II.,Just threaded with a blue vein’s tapestry
2680,II.,"Had not yet ceased to throb, and still her breast"
2681,II.,Swayed like a wind-stirred lily in ambiguous unrest)
2682,II.,
2683,II.,"And then each pigeon spread its milky van,"
2684,II.,"The bright car soared into the dawning sky,"
2685,II.,And like a cloud the aerial caravan
2686,II.,"Passed over the Ægean silently,"
2687,II.,Till the faint air was troubled with the song
2688,II.,From the wan mouths that call on bleeding Thammuz all night long.
2689,II.,
2690,II.,But when the doves had reached their wonted goal
2691,II.,Where the wide stair of orbèd marble dips
2692,II.,"Its snows into the sea, her fluttering soul"
2693,II.,Just shook the trembling petals of her lips
2694,II.,"And passed into the void, and Venus knew"
2695,II.,"That one fair maid the less would walk amid her retinue,"
2696,II.,
2697,II.,And bade her servants carve a cedar chest
2698,II.,"With all the wonder of this history,"
2699,II.,Within whose scented womb their limbs should rest
2700,II.,Where olive-trees make tender the blue sky
2701,II.,"On the low hills of Paphos, and the Faun"
2702,II.,"Pipes in the noonday, and the nightingale sings on till dawn."
2703,II.,
2704,II.,"Nor failed they to obey her hest, and ere"
2705,II.,The morning bee had stung the daffodil
2706,II.,"With tiny fretful spear, or from its lair"
2707,II.,The waking stag had leapt across the rill
2708,II.,"And roused the ouzel, or the lizard crept"
2709,II.,"Athwart the sunny rock, beneath the grass their bodies slept."
2710,II.,
2711,II.,"And when day brake, within that silver shrine"
2712,II.,"Fed by the flames of cressets tremulous,"
2713,II.,Queen Venus knelt and prayed to Proserpine
2714,II.,That she whose beauty made Death amorous
2715,II.,"Should beg a guerdon from her pallid Lord,"
2716,II.,And let Desire pass across dread Charon’s icy ford.
2717,II.,
2718,III,III
2719,III,
2720,III,"IN melancholy moonless Acheron,"
2721,III,Farm for the goodly earth and joyous day
2722,III,"Where no spring ever buds, nor ripening sun"
2723,III,"Weighs down the apple trees, nor flowery May"
2724,III,"Chequers with chestnut blooms the grassy floor,"
2725,III,"Where thrushes never sing, and piping linnets mate no more,"
2726,III,
2727,III,There by a dim and dark Lethæan well
2728,III,Young Charmides was lying; wearily
2729,III,"He plucked the blossoms from the asphodel,"
2730,III,And with its little rifled treasury
2731,III,"Strewed the dull waters of the dusky stream,"
2732,III,"And watched the white stars founder, and the land was like a dream,"
2733,III,
2734,III,When as he gazed into the watery glass
2735,III,And through his brown hair’s curly tangles scanned
2736,III,"His own wan face, a shadow seemed to pass"
2737,III,"Across the mirror, and a little hand"
2738,III,"Stole into his, and warm lips timidly"
2739,III,"Brushed his pale cheeks, and breathed their secret forth into a sigh."
2740,III,
2741,III,"Then turned he round his weary eyes and saw,"
2742,III,"And ever nigher still their faces came,"
2743,III,And nigher ever did their young mouths draw
2744,III,"Until they seemed one perfect rose of flame,"
2745,III,"And longing arms around her neck he cast,"
2746,III,"And felt her throbbing bosom, and his breath came hot and fast,"
2747,III,
2748,III,"And all his hoarded sweets were hers to kiss,"
2749,III,"And all her maidenhood was his to slay,"
2750,III,And limb to limb in long and rapturous bliss
2751,III,"Their passion waxed and waned,—O why essay"
2752,III,"To pipe again of love, too venturous reed!"
2753,III,"Enough, enough that Eros laughed upon that flowerless mead."
2754,III,
2755,III,"Too venturous poesy, O why essay"
2756,III,To pipe again of passion! fold thy wings
2757,III,O’er daring Icarus and bid thy lay
2758,III,Sleep hidden in the lyre’s silent strings
2759,III,"Till thou hast found the old Castalian rill,"
2760,III,Or from the Lesbian waters plucked drowned Sappho’s golden quid!
2761,III,
2762,III,"Enough, enough that he whose life had been"
2763,III,"A fiery pulse of sin, a splendid shame,"
2764,III,Could in the loveless land of Hades glean
2765,III,One scorching harvest from those fields of flame
2766,III,Where passion walks with naked unshod feet
2767,III,"And is not wounded,—ah! enough that once their lips could meet"
2768,III,
2769,III,In that wild throb when all existences
2770,III,Seemed narrowed to one single ecstasy
2771,III,Which dies through its own sweetness and the stress
2772,III,"Of too much pleasure, ere Persephone"
2773,III,Had bade them serve her by the ebon throne
2774,III,Of the pale God who in the fields of Enna loosed her zone.

3391,PANTHEA,"The moor our kinsmen are, all life is one, and all is change."
3392,PANTHEA,
3393,PANTHEA,With beat of systole and of diastole
3394,PANTHEA,"One grand great life throbs through earth’s giant heart,"
3395,PANTHEA,And mighty waves of single Being roll
3396,PANTHEA,"From nerveless germ to man, for we are part"
3397,PANTHEA,"Of every rock and bird and beast and hill,"
3398,PANTHEA,"One with the things that prey on us, and one with what we kill."
3399,PANTHEA,
3400,PANTHEA,From lower cells of waking life we pass
3401,PANTHEA,To full perfection; thus the world grows old:
3402,PANTHEA,We who are godlike now were once a mass
3403,PANTHEA,"Of quivering purple flecked with bars of gold,"
3404,PANTHEA,"Unsentient or of joy or misery,"
3405,PANTHEA,And tossed in terrible tangles of some wild and wind-swept sea.
3406,PANTHEA,
3407,PANTHEA,This hot hard flame with which our bodies burn
3408,PANTHEA,"Will make some meadow blaze with daffodil,"
3409,PANTHEA,Ay! and those argent breasts of thine will turn
3410,PANTHEA,To water-lilies; the brown fields men till
3411,PANTHEA,"Will be more fruitful for our love to-night,"
3412,PANTHEA,"Nothing is lost in nature, all things live in Death’s despite."
3413,PANTHEA,
3414,PANTHEA,"The boy’s first kiss, the hyacinth’s first bell,"
3415,PANTHEA,"The man’s last passion, and the last red spear"
3416,PANTHEA,"That from the lily leaps, the asphodel"
3417,PANTHEA,Which will not let its blossoms blow for fear
3418,PANTHEA,"Of too much beauty, and the timid shame"
3419,PANTHEA,"Of the young bridegroom at his lover’s eyes,—these with the same"
3420,PANTHEA,
3421,PANTHEA,"One sacrament are consecrate, the earth"
3422,PANTHEA,"Not we alone hath passions hymeneal,"
3423,PANTHEA,The yellow buttercups that shake for mirth
3424,PANTHEA,At daybreak know a pleasure not less real
3425,PANTHEA,"Than we do, when in some fresh-blossoming wood,"
3426,PANTHEA,"We draw the spring into our hearts, and feel that life is good."
3427,PANTHEA,
3428,PANTHEA,So when men bury us beneath the yew
3429,PANTHEA,"Thy crimson-stainèd mouth a rose will be,"
3430,PANTHEA,"And thy soft eyes lush bluebells dimmed with dew,"
3431,PANTHEA,And when the white narcissus wantonly
3432,PANTHEA,Kisses the wind its playmate some faint joy
3433,PANTHEA,"Will thrill our dust, and we will be again fond maid and boy."
3434,PANTHEA,
3435,PANTHEA,And thus without life’s conscious torturing pain
3436,PANTHEA,"In some sweet flower we will feel the sun,"
3437,PANTHEA,"And from the linnet’s throat will sing again,"
3438,PANTHEA,And as two gorgeous-mailèd snakes will run
3439,PANTHEA,"Over our graves, or as two tigers creep"
3440,PANTHEA,Through the hot jungle where the yellow-eyed huge lions sleep
3441,PANTHEA,
3442,PANTHEA,And give them battle!  How my heart leaps up
3443,PANTHEA,To think of that grand living after death
3444,PANTHEA,"In beast and bird and flower, when this cup,"
3445,PANTHEA,"Being filled too full of spirit, bursts for breath,"
3446,PANTHEA,And with the pale leaves of some autumn day
3447,PANTHEA,The soul earth’s earliest conqueror becomes earth’s last great prey.
3448,PANTHEA,
3449,PANTHEA,O think of it!  We shall inform ourselves
3450,PANTHEA,"Into all sensuous life, the goat-foot Faun,"
3451,PANTHEA,"The Centaur, or the merry bright-eyed Elves"
3452,PANTHEA,That leave their dancing rings to spite the dawn
3453,PANTHEA,"Upon the meadows, shall not be more near"
3454,PANTHEA,"Than you and I to nature’s mysteries, for we shall hear"
3455,PANTHEA,
3456,PANTHEA,"The thrush’s heart beat, and the daisies grow,"
3457,PANTHEA,And the wan snowdrop sighing for the sun
3458,PANTHEA,"On sunless days in winter, we shall know"
3459,PANTHEA,"By whom the silver gossamer is spun,"
3460,PANTHEA,"Who paints the diapered fritillaries,"
3461,PANTHEA,On what wide wings from shivering pine to pine the eagle flies.
3462,PANTHEA,
3463,PANTHEA,"Ay! had we never loved at all, who knows"
3464,PANTHEA,If yonder daffodil had lured the bee
3465,PANTHEA,"Into its gilded womb, or any rose"
3466,PANTHEA,Had hung with crimson lamps its little tree!
3467,PANTHEA,"Methinks no leaf would ever bud in spring,"
3468,PANTHEA,"But for the lovers’ lips that kiss, the poets’ lips that sing."
3469,PANTHEA,
3470,PANTHEA,"Is the light vanished from our golden sun,"
3471,PANTHEA,"Or is this dædal-fashioned earth less fair,"
3472,PANTHEA,"That we are nature’s heritors, and one"
3473,PANTHEA,With every pulse of life that beats the air?
3474,PANTHEA,"Rather new suns across the sky shall pass,"
3475,PANTHEA,"New splendour come unto the flower, new glory to the grass."
3476,PANTHEA,
3477,PANTHEA,"And we two lovers shall not sit afar,"
3478,PANTHEA,"Critics of nature, but the joyous sea"
3479,PANTHEA,"Shall be our raiment, and the bearded star"
3480,PANTHEA,Shoot arrows at our pleasure!  We shall be
3481,PANTHEA,"Part of the mighty universal whole,"
3482,PANTHEA,And through all æons mix and mingle with the Kosmic Soul!
3483,PANTHEA,
3484,PANTHEA,We shall be notes in that great Symphony
3485,PANTHEA,"Whose cadence circles through the rhythmic spheres,"
3486,PANTHEA,And all the live World’s throbbing heart shall be
3487,PANTHEA,One with our heart; the stealthy creeping years
3488,PANTHEA,"Have lost their terrors now, we shall not die,"
3489,PANTHEA,The Universe itself shall be our Immortality.

3799,HUMANITAD,"Red leaf by leaf its folded panoply,"
3800,HUMANITAD,"And pansies closed their purple-lidded eyes,"
3801,HUMANITAD,Chrysanthemums from gilded argosy
3802,HUMANITAD,"Unload their gaudy scentless merchandise,"
3803,HUMANITAD,And violets getting overbold withdraw
3804,HUMANITAD,"From their shy nooks, and scarlet berries dot the leafless haw."
3805,HUMANITAD,
3806,HUMANITAD,O happy field! and O thrice happy tree!
3807,HUMANITAD,Soon will your queen in daisy-flowered smock
3808,HUMANITAD,"And crown of flower-de-luce trip down the lea,"
3809,HUMANITAD,Soon will the lazy shepherds drive their flock
3810,HUMANITAD,"Back to the pasture by the pool, and soon"
3811,HUMANITAD,Through the green leaves will float the hum of murmuring bees at noon.
3812,HUMANITAD,
3813,HUMANITAD,"Soon will the glade be bright with bellamour,"
3814,HUMANITAD,"The flower which wantons love, and those sweet nuns"
3815,HUMANITAD,Vale-lilies in their snowy vestiture
3816,HUMANITAD,"Will tell their beaded pearls, and carnations"
3817,HUMANITAD,"With mitred dusky leaves will scent the wind,"
3818,HUMANITAD,And straggling traveller’s-joy each hedge with yellow stars will bind.
3819,HUMANITAD,
3820,HUMANITAD,"Dear bride of Nature and most bounteous spring,"
3821,HUMANITAD,"That canst give increase to the sweet-breath’d kine,"
3822,HUMANITAD,"And to the kid its little horns, and bring"
3823,HUMANITAD,"The soft and silky blossoms to the vine,"
3824,HUMANITAD,Where is that old nepenthe which of yore
3825,HUMANITAD,Man got from poppy root and glossy-berried mandragore!
3826,HUMANITAD,
3827,HUMANITAD,There was a time when any common bird
3828,HUMANITAD,"Could make me sing in unison, a time"
3829,HUMANITAD,When all the strings of boyish life were stirred
3830,HUMANITAD,To quick response or more melodious rhyme
3831,HUMANITAD,By every forest idyll;—do I change?
3832,HUMANITAD,Or rather doth some evil thing through thy fair pleasaunce range?
3833,HUMANITAD,
3834,HUMANITAD,"Nay, nay, thou art the same: ’tis I who seek"
3835,HUMANITAD,"To vex with sighs thy simple solitude,"
3836,HUMANITAD,And because fruitless tears bedew my cheek
3837,HUMANITAD,Would have thee weep with me in brotherhood;
3838,HUMANITAD,Fool! shall each wronged and restless spirit dare
3839,HUMANITAD,To taint such wine with the salt poison of own despair!
3840,HUMANITAD,
3841,HUMANITAD,Thou art the same: ’tis I whose wretched soul
3842,HUMANITAD,"Takes discontent to be its paramour,"
3843,HUMANITAD,And gives its kingdom to the rude control
3844,HUMANITAD,"Of what should be its servitor,—for sure"
3845,HUMANITAD,"Wisdom is somewhere, though the stormy sea"
3846,HUMANITAD,"Contain it not, and the huge deep answer ‘’Tis not in me.’"
3847,HUMANITAD,
3848,HUMANITAD,"To burn with one clear flame, to stand erect"
3849,HUMANITAD,"In natural honour, not to bend the knee"
3850,HUMANITAD,In profitless prostrations whose effect
3851,HUMANITAD,"Is by itself condemned, what alchemy"
3852,HUMANITAD,Can teach me this? what herb Medea brewed
3853,HUMANITAD,Will bring the unexultant peace of essence not subdued?
3854,HUMANITAD,
3855,HUMANITAD,"The minor chord which ends the harmony,"
3856,HUMANITAD,And for its answering brother waits in vain
3857,HUMANITAD,"Sobbing for incompleted melody,"
3858,HUMANITAD,"Dies a swan’s death; but I the heir of pain,"
3859,HUMANITAD,"A silent Memnon with blank lidless eyes,"
3860,HUMANITAD,Wait for the light and music of those suns which never rise.
3861,HUMANITAD,
3862,HUMANITAD,"The quenched-out torch, the lonely cypress-gloom,"
3863,HUMANITAD,"The little dust stored in the narrow urn,"
3864,HUMANITAD,"The gentle ΧΑΙΡΕ of the Attic tomb,—"
3865,HUMANITAD,Were not these better far than to return
3866,HUMANITAD,"To my old fitful restless malady,"
3867,HUMANITAD,Or spend my days within the voiceless cave of misery?
3868,HUMANITAD,
3869,HUMANITAD,Nay! for perchance that poppy-crownèd god
3870,HUMANITAD,Is like the watcher by a sick man’s bed
3871,HUMANITAD,Who talks of sleep but gives it not; his rod
3872,HUMANITAD,"Hath lost its virtue, and, when all is said,"
3873,HUMANITAD,"Death is too rude, too obvious a key"
3874,HUMANITAD,To solve one single secret in a life’s philosophy.
3875,HUMANITAD,
3876,HUMANITAD,"And Love! that noble madness, whose august"
3877,HUMANITAD,And inextinguishable might can slay
3878,HUMANITAD,"The soul with honeyed drugs,—alas! I must"
3879,HUMANITAD,"From such sweet ruin play the runaway,"
3880,HUMANITAD,Although too constant memory never can
3881,HUMANITAD,Forget the archèd splendour of those brows Olympian
3882,HUMANITAD,
3883,HUMANITAD,Which for a little season made my youth
3884,HUMANITAD,So soft a swoon of exquisite indolence
3885,HUMANITAD,That all the chiding of more prudent Truth
3886,HUMANITAD,"Seemed the thin voice of jealousy,—O hence"
3887,HUMANITAD,Thou huntress deadlier than Artemis!
3888,HUMANITAD,Go seek some other quarry! for of thy too perilous bliss.
3889,HUMANITAD,
3890,HUMANITAD,"My lips have drunk enough,—no more, no more,—"
3891,HUMANITAD,Though Love himself should turn his gilded prow
3892,HUMANITAD,Back to the troubled waters of this shore
3893,HUMANITAD,"Where I am wrecked and stranded, even now"
3894,HUMANITAD,"The chariot wheels of passion sweep too near,"
3895,HUMANITAD,"Hence!  Hence!  I pass unto a life more barren, more austere."
3896,HUMANITAD,
3897,HUMANITAD,"More barren—ay, those arms will never lean"
3898,HUMANITAD,Down through the trellised vines and draw my soul
3899,HUMANITAD,In sweet reluctance through the tangled green;
3900,HUMANITAD,"Some other head must wear that aureole,"
3901,HUMANITAD,For I am hers who loves not any man
3902,HUMANITAD,Whose white and stainless bosom bears the sign Gorgonian.
3903,HUMANITAD,
3904,HUMANITAD,"Let Venus go and chuck her dainty page,"
3905,HUMANITAD,"And kiss his mouth, and toss his curly hair,"
3906,HUMANITAD,With net and spear and hunting equipage
3907,HUMANITAD,"Let young Adonis to his tryst repair,"
3908,HUMANITAD,But me her fond and subtle-fashioned spell
3909,HUMANITAD,"Delights no more, though I could win her dearest citadel."
3910,HUMANITAD,
3911,HUMANITAD,"Ay, though I were that laughing shepherd boy"
3912,HUMANITAD,Who from Mount Ida saw the little cloud
3913,HUMANITAD,Pass over Tenedos and lofty Troy
3914,HUMANITAD,"And knew the coming of the Queen, and bowed"
3915,HUMANITAD,"In wonder at her feet, not for the sake"
3916,HUMANITAD,Of a new Helen would I bid her hand the apple take.
3917,HUMANITAD,
3918,HUMANITAD,Then rise supreme Athena argent-limbed!
3919,HUMANITAD,"And, if my lips be musicless, inspire"
3920,HUMANITAD,At least my life: was not thy glory hymned
3921,HUMANITAD,By One who gave to thee his sword and lyre
3922,HUMANITAD,"Like Æschylos at well-fought Marathon,"
3923,HUMANITAD,And died to show that Milton’s England still could bear a son!
3924,HUMANITAD,
3925,HUMANITAD,And yet I cannot tread the Portico
3926,HUMANITAD,"And live without desire, fear and pain,"
3927,HUMANITAD,Or nurture that wise calm which long ago
3928,HUMANITAD,"The grave Athenian master taught to men,"
3929,HUMANITAD,"Self-poised, self-centred, and self-comforted,"
3930,HUMANITAD,To watch the world’s vain phantasies go by with unbowed head.
3931,HUMANITAD,
3932,HUMANITAD,"Alas! that serene brow, those eloquent lips,"
3933,HUMANITAD,"Those eyes that mirrored all eternity,"
3934,HUMANITAD,"Rest in their own Colonos, an eclipse"
3935,HUMANITAD,"Hath come on Wisdom, and Mnemosyne"
3936,HUMANITAD,Is childless; in the night which she had made
3937,HUMANITAD,For lofty secure flight Athena’s owl itself hath strayed.
3938,HUMANITAD,
3939,HUMANITAD,"Nor much with Science do I care to climb,"
3940,HUMANITAD,Although by strange and subtle witchery
3941,HUMANITAD,She drew the moon from heaven: the Muse Time
3942,HUMANITAD,Unrolls her gorgeous-coloured tapestry
3943,HUMANITAD,To no less eager eyes; often indeed
3944,HUMANITAD,In the great epic of Polymnia’s scroll I love to read
3945,HUMANITAD,
3946,HUMANITAD,How Asia sent her myriad hosts to war
3947,HUMANITAD,"Against a little town, and panoplied"
3948,HUMANITAD,"In gilded mail with jewelled scimitar,"
3949,HUMANITAD,"White-shielded, purple-crested, rode the Mede"
3950,HUMANITAD,Between the waving poplars and the sea
3951,HUMANITAD,"Which men call Artemisium, till he saw Thermopylæ"
3952,HUMANITAD,
3953,HUMANITAD,"Its steep ravine spanned by a narrow wall,"
3954,HUMANITAD,And on the nearer side a little brood
3955,HUMANITAD,Of careless lions holding festival!
3956,HUMANITAD,"And stood amazèd at such hardihood,"
3957,HUMANITAD,"And pitched his tent upon the reedy shore,"
3958,HUMANITAD,"And stayed two days to wonder, and then crept at midnight o’er"
3959,HUMANITAD,
3960,HUMANITAD,"Some unfrequented height, and coming down"
3961,HUMANITAD,The autumn forests treacherously slew
3962,HUMANITAD,What Sparta held most dear and was the crown
3963,HUMANITAD,"Of far Eurotas, and passed on, nor knew"
3964,HUMANITAD,How God had staked an evil net for him
3965,HUMANITAD,"In the small bay at Salamis,—and yet, the page grows dim,"
3966,HUMANITAD,
3967,HUMANITAD,"Its cadenced Greek delights me not, I feel"
3968,HUMANITAD,With such a goodly time too out of tune
3969,HUMANITAD,To love it much: for like the Dial’s wheel
3970,HUMANITAD,That from its blinded darkness strikes the noon
3971,HUMANITAD,"Yet never sees the sun, so do my eyes"
3972,HUMANITAD,Restlessly follow that which from my cheated vision flies.
3973,HUMANITAD,
3974,HUMANITAD,O for one grand unselfish simple life
3975,HUMANITAD,To teach us what is Wisdom! speak ye hills
3976,HUMANITAD,"Of lone Helvellyn, for this note of strife"
3977,HUMANITAD,"Shunned your untroubled crags and crystal rills,"
3978,HUMANITAD,Where is that Spirit which living blamelessly
3979,HUMANITAD,Yet dared to kiss the smitten mouth of his own century!
3980,HUMANITAD,
3981,HUMANITAD,Speak ye Rydalian laurels! where is he
3982,HUMANITAD,"Whose gentle head ye sheltered, that pure soul"
3983,HUMANITAD,Whose gracious days of uncrowned majesty
3984,HUMANITAD,Through lowliest conduct touched the lofty goal
3985,HUMANITAD,Where love and duty mingle!  Him at least
3986,HUMANITAD,"The most high Laws were glad of, he had sat at Wisdom’s feast;"
3987,HUMANITAD,
3988,HUMANITAD,"But we are Learning’s changelings, know by rote"
3989,HUMANITAD,The clarion watchword of each Grecian school
3990,HUMANITAD,"And follow none, the flawless sword which smote"
3991,HUMANITAD,The pagan Hydra is an effete tool
3992,HUMANITAD,"Which we ourselves have blunted, what man now"
3993,HUMANITAD,Shall scale the august ancient heights and to old Reverence bow?
3994,HUMANITAD,
3995,HUMANITAD,"One such indeed I saw, but, Ichabod!"
3996,HUMANITAD,"Gone is that last dear son of Italy,"
3997,HUMANITAD,"Who being man died for the sake of God,"
3998,HUMANITAD,"And whose unrisen bones sleep peacefully,"
3999,HUMANITAD,"O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto’s tower,"
4000,HUMANITAD,Thou marble lily of the lily town! let not the lour
4001,HUMANITAD,
4002,HUMANITAD,"Of the rude tempest vex his slumber, or"
4003,HUMANITAD,The Arno with its tawny troubled gold
4004,HUMANITAD,"O’er-leap its marge, no mightier conqueror"
4005,HUMANITAD,Clomb the high Capitol in the days of old
4006,HUMANITAD,"When Rome was indeed Rome, for Liberty"
4007,HUMANITAD,"Walked like a bride beside him, at which sight pale Mystery"
4008,HUMANITAD,
4009,HUMANITAD,Fled shrieking to her farthest sombrest cell
4010,HUMANITAD,"With an old man who grabbled rusty keys,"
4011,HUMANITAD,"Fled shuddering, for that immemorial knell"
4012,HUMANITAD,With which oblivion buries dynasties
4013,HUMANITAD,"Swept like a wounded eagle on the blast,"
4014,HUMANITAD,As to the holy heart of Rome the great triumvir passed.
4015,HUMANITAD,
4016,HUMANITAD,"He knew the holiest heart and heights of Rome,"
4017,HUMANITAD,"He drave the base wolf from the lion’s lair,"
4018,HUMANITAD,And now lies dead by that empyreal dome
4019,HUMANITAD,Which overtops Valdarno hung in air
4020,HUMANITAD,By Brunelleschi—O Melpomene
4021,HUMANITAD,Breathe through thy melancholy pipe thy sweetest threnody!
4022,HUMANITAD,
4023,HUMANITAD,Breathe through the tragic stops such melodies
4024,HUMANITAD,"That Joy’s self may grow jealous, and the Nine"
4025,HUMANITAD,"Forget awhile their discreet emperies,"
4026,HUMANITAD,Mourning for him who on Rome’s lordliest shrine
4027,HUMANITAD,"Lit for men’s lives the light of Marathon,"
4028,HUMANITAD,And bare to sun-forgotten fields the fire of the sun!
4029,HUMANITAD,
4030,HUMANITAD,"O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto’s tower!"
4031,HUMANITAD,Let some young Florentine each eventide
4032,HUMANITAD,Bring coronals of that enchanted flower
4033,HUMANITAD,"Which the dim woods of Vallombrosa hide,"
4034,HUMANITAD,And deck the marble tomb wherein he lies
4035,HUMANITAD,Whose soul is as some mighty orb unseen of mortal eyes;
4036,HUMANITAD,
4037,HUMANITAD,"Some mighty orb whose cycled wanderings,"
4038,HUMANITAD,Being tempest-driven to the farthest rim
4039,HUMANITAD,Where Chaos meets Creation and the wings
4040,HUMANITAD,Of the eternal chanting Cherubim
4041,HUMANITAD,"Are pavilioned on Nothing, passed away"
4042,HUMANITAD,"Into a moonless void,—and yet, though he is dust and clay,"
4043,HUMANITAD,
4044,HUMANITAD,"He is not dead, the immemorial Fates"
4045,HUMANITAD,"Forbid it, and the closing shears refrain."
4046,HUMANITAD,Lift up your heads ye everlasting gates!
4047,HUMANITAD,"Ye argent clarions, sound a loftier strain"
4048,HUMANITAD,For the vile thing he hated lurks within
4049,HUMANITAD,"Its sombre house, alone with God and memories of sin."
4050,HUMANITAD,
4051,HUMANITAD,Still what avails it that she sought her cave
4052,HUMANITAD,That murderous mother of red harlotries?
4053,HUMANITAD,At Munich on the marble architrave
4054,HUMANITAD,"The Grecian boys die smiling, but the seas"
4055,HUMANITAD,Which wash Ægina fret in loneliness
4056,HUMANITAD,Not mirroring their beauty; so our lives grow colourless
4057,HUMANITAD,
4058,HUMANITAD,"For lack of our ideals, if one star"
4059,HUMANITAD,Flame torch-like in the heavens the unjust
4060,HUMANITAD,"Swift daylight kills it, and no trump of war"
4061,HUMANITAD,Can wake to passionate voice the silent dust
4062,HUMANITAD,Which was Mazzini once! rich Niobe
4063,HUMANITAD,"For all her stony sorrows hath her sons; but Italy,"
4064,HUMANITAD,
4065,HUMANITAD,"What Easter Day shall make her children rise,"
4066,HUMANITAD,Who were not Gods yet suffered? what sure feet
4067,HUMANITAD,Shall find their grave-clothes folded? what clear eyes
4068,HUMANITAD,Shall see them bodily?  O it were meet
4069,HUMANITAD,To roll the stone from off the sepulchre
4070,HUMANITAD,"And kiss the bleeding roses of their wounds, in love of her,"
4071,HUMANITAD,
4072,HUMANITAD,Our Italy! our mother visible!
4073,HUMANITAD,"Most blessed among nations and most sad,"
4074,HUMANITAD,For whose dear sake the young Calabrian fell
4075,HUMANITAD,That day at Aspromonte and was glad
4076,HUMANITAD,That in an age when God was bought and sold
4077,HUMANITAD,"One man could die for Liberty! but we, burnt out and cold,"
4078,HUMANITAD,
4079,HUMANITAD,See Honour smitten on the cheek and gyves
4080,HUMANITAD,Bind the sweet feet of Mercy: Poverty
4081,HUMANITAD,Creeps through our sunless lanes and with sharp knives
4082,HUMANITAD,"Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily,"
4083,HUMANITAD,And no word said:—O we are wretched men
4084,HUMANITAD,Unworthy of our great inheritance! where is the pen
4085,HUMANITAD,
4086,HUMANITAD,Of austere Milton? where the mighty sword
4087,HUMANITAD,Which slew its master righteously? the years
4088,HUMANITAD,"Have lost their ancient leader, and no word"
4089,HUMANITAD,Breaks from the voiceless tripod on our ears:
4090,HUMANITAD,While as a ruined mother in some spasm
4091,HUMANITAD,"Bears a base child and loathes it, so our best enthusiasm"
4092,HUMANITAD,
4093,HUMANITAD,"Genders unlawful children, Anarchy"
4094,HUMANITAD,"Freedom’s own Judas, the vile prodigal"
4095,HUMANITAD,Licence who steals the gold of Liberty
4096,HUMANITAD,"And yet has nothing, Ignorance the real"
4097,HUMANITAD,"One Fraticide since Cain, Envy the asp"
4098,HUMANITAD,"That stings itself to anguish, Avarice whose palsied grasp"
4099,HUMANITAD,
4100,HUMANITAD,"Is in its extent stiffened, moneyed Greed"
4101,HUMANITAD,For whose dull appetite men waste away
4102,HUMANITAD,Amid the whirr of wheels and are the seed
4103,HUMANITAD,"Of things which slay their sower, these each day"
4104,HUMANITAD,"Sees rife in England, and the gentle feet"
4105,HUMANITAD,Of Beauty tread no more the stones of each unlovely street.
4106,HUMANITAD,
4107,HUMANITAD,What even Cromwell spared is desecrated
4108,HUMANITAD,"By weed and worm, left to the stormy play"
4109,HUMANITAD,"Of wind and beating snow, or renovated"
4110,HUMANITAD,By more destructful hands: Time’s worst decay
4111,HUMANITAD,"Will wreathe its ruins with some loveliness,"
4112,HUMANITAD,But these new Vandals can but make a rain-proof barrenness.
4113,HUMANITAD,
4114,HUMANITAD,Where is that Art which bade the Angels sing
4115,HUMANITAD,"Through Lincoln’s lofty choir, till the air"
4116,HUMANITAD,Seems from such marble harmonies to ring
4117,HUMANITAD,With sweeter song than common lips can dare
4118,HUMANITAD,To draw from actual reed? ah! where is now
4119,HUMANITAD,The cunning hand which made the flowering hawthorn branches bow
4120,HUMANITAD,
4121,HUMANITAD,"For Southwell’s arch, and carved the House of One"
4122,HUMANITAD,Who loved the lilies of the field with all
4123,HUMANITAD,Our dearest English flowers? the same sun
4124,HUMANITAD,Rises for us: the seasons natural
4125,HUMANITAD,Weave the same tapestry of green and grey:
4126,HUMANITAD,The unchanged hills are with us: but that Spirit hath passed away.
4127,HUMANITAD,
4128,HUMANITAD,"And yet perchance it may be better so,"
4129,HUMANITAD,"For Tyranny is an incestuous Queen,"
4130,HUMANITAD,"Murder her brother is her bedfellow,"
4131,HUMANITAD,And the Plague chambers with her: in obscene
4132,HUMANITAD,And bloody paths her treacherous feet are set;
4133,HUMANITAD,Better the empty desert and a soul inviolate!
4134,HUMANITAD,
4135,HUMANITAD,"For gentle brotherhood, the harmony"
4136,HUMANITAD,"Of living in the healthful air, the swift"
4137,HUMANITAD,Clean beauty of strong limbs when men are free
4138,HUMANITAD,"And women chaste, these are the things which lift"
4139,HUMANITAD,Our souls up more than even Agnolo’s
4140,HUMANITAD,"Gaunt blinded Sibyl poring o’er the scroll of human woes,"
4141,HUMANITAD,
4142,HUMANITAD,Or Titian’s little maiden on the stair
4143,HUMANITAD,"White as her own sweet lily and as tall,"
4144,HUMANITAD,"Or Mona Lisa smiling through her hair,—"
4145,HUMANITAD,Ah! somehow life is bigger after all
4146,HUMANITAD,"Than any painted angel, could we see"
4147,HUMANITAD,The God that is within us!  The old Greek serenity
4148,HUMANITAD,
4149,HUMANITAD,Which curbs the passion of that level line
4150,HUMANITAD,"Of marble youths, who with untroubled eyes"
4151,HUMANITAD,And chastened limbs ride round Athena’s shrine
4152,HUMANITAD,"And mirror her divine economies,"
4153,HUMANITAD,And balanced symmetry of what in man
4154,HUMANITAD,"Would else wage ceaseless warfare,—this at least within the span"
4155,HUMANITAD,
4156,HUMANITAD,Between our mother’s kisses and the grave
4157,HUMANITAD,"Might so inform our lives, that we could win"
4158,HUMANITAD,Such mighty empires that from her cave
4159,HUMANITAD,"Temptation would grow hoarse, and pallid Sin"
4160,HUMANITAD,"Would walk ashamed of his adulteries,"
4161,HUMANITAD,And Passion creep from out the House of Lust with startled eyes.
4162,HUMANITAD,
4163,HUMANITAD,To make the body and the spirit one
4164,HUMANITAD,"With all right things, till no thing live in vain"
4165,HUMANITAD,"From morn to noon, but in sweet unison"
4166,HUMANITAD,With every pulse of flesh and throb of brain
4167,HUMANITAD,"The soul in flawless essence high enthroned,"
4168,HUMANITAD,"Against all outer vain attack invincibly bastioned,"
4169,HUMANITAD,
4170,HUMANITAD,Mark with serene impartiality
4171,HUMANITAD,"The strife of things, and yet be comforted,"
4172,HUMANITAD,Knowing that by the chain causality
4173,HUMANITAD,All separate existences are wed
4174,HUMANITAD,"Into one supreme whole, whose utterance"
4175,HUMANITAD,"Is joy, or holier praise! ah! surely this were governance"
4176,HUMANITAD,
4177,HUMANITAD,"Of Life in most august omnipresence,"
4178,HUMANITAD,Through which the rational intellect would find
4179,HUMANITAD,"In passion its expression, and mere sense,"
4180,HUMANITAD,"Ignoble else, lend fire to the mind,"
4181,HUMANITAD,And being joined with it in harmony
4182,HUMANITAD,"More mystical than that which binds the stars planetary,"
4183,HUMANITAD,
4184,HUMANITAD,Strike from their several tones one octave chord
4185,HUMANITAD,Whose cadence being measureless would fly
4186,HUMANITAD,"Through all the circling spheres, then to its Lord"
4187,HUMANITAD,Return refreshed with its new empery
4188,HUMANITAD,"And more exultant power,—this indeed"
4189,HUMANITAD,"Could we but reach it were to find the last, the perfect creed."
4190,HUMANITAD,
4191,HUMANITAD,Ah! it was easy when the world was young
4192,HUMANITAD,"To keep one’s life free and inviolate,"
4193,HUMANITAD,"From our sad lips another song is rung,"
4194,HUMANITAD,"By our own hands our heads are desecrate,"
4195,HUMANITAD,"Wanderers in drear exile, and dispossessed"
4196,HUMANITAD,"Of what should be our own, we can but feed on wild unrest."
4197,HUMANITAD,
4198,HUMANITAD,"Somehow the grace, the bloom of things has flown,"
4199,HUMANITAD,And of all men we are most wretched who
4200,HUMANITAD,Must live each other’s lives and not our own
4201,HUMANITAD,For very pity’s sake and then undo
4202,HUMANITAD,All that we lived for—it was otherwise
4203,HUMANITAD,When soul and body seemed to blend in mystic symphonies.
4204,HUMANITAD,
4205,HUMANITAD,But we have left those gentle haunts to pass
4206,HUMANITAD,"With weary feet to the new Calvary,"
4207,HUMANITAD,"Where we behold, as one who in a glass"
4208,HUMANITAD,"Sees his own face, self-slain Humanity,"
4209,HUMANITAD,And in the dumb reproach of that sad gaze
4210,HUMANITAD,Learn what an awful phantom the red hand of man can raise.
4211,HUMANITAD,
4212,HUMANITAD,O smitten mouth!  O forehead crowned with thorn!
4213,HUMANITAD,O chalice of all common miseries!
4214,HUMANITAD,Thou for our sakes that loved thee not hast borne
4215,HUMANITAD,"An agony of endless centuries,"
4216,HUMANITAD,And we were vain and ignorant nor knew
4217,HUMANITAD,That when we stabbed thy heart it was our own real hearts we slew.
4218,HUMANITAD,
4219,HUMANITAD,"Being ourselves the sowers and the seeds,"
4220,HUMANITAD,"The night that covers and the lights that fade,"
4221,HUMANITAD,"The spear that pierces and the side that bleeds,"
4222,HUMANITAD,The lips betraying and the life betrayed;
4223,HUMANITAD,The deep hath calm: the moon hath rest: but we
4224,HUMANITAD,Lords of the natural world are yet our own dread enemy.
4225,HUMANITAD,
4226,HUMANITAD,Is this the end of all that primal force
4227,HUMANITAD,"Which, in its changes being still the same,"
4228,HUMANITAD,"From eyeless Chaos cleft its upward course,"
4229,HUMANITAD,"Through ravenous seas and whirling rocks and flame,"
4230,HUMANITAD,Till the suns met in heaven and began
4231,HUMANITAD,"Their cycles, and the morning stars sang, and the Word was Man!"
4232,HUMANITAD,
4233,HUMANITAD,"Nay, nay, we are but crucified, and though"
4234,HUMANITAD,The bloody sweat falls from our brows like rain
4235,HUMANITAD,"Loosen the nails—we shall come down I know,"
4236,HUMANITAD,"Staunch the red wounds—we shall be whole again,"
4237,HUMANITAD,"No need have we of hyssop-laden rod,"
4238,HUMANITAD,"That which is purely human, that is godlike, that is God."

4250,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,I had climbed the higher heights unclimbed

4252,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,
4253,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,From the wildness of my wasted passion I had
4254,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,"struck a better, clearer song,"
4255,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,"Lit some lighter light of freer freedom, battled"
4256,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,with some Hydra-headed wrong.
4257,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,

4260,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,You had walked with Bice and the angels on

4262,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,
4263,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,I had trod the road which Dante treading saw
4264,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,"the suns of seven circles shine,"
4265,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,"Ay! perchance had seen the heavens opening,"

4267,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,

4269,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,"me, who am crownless now and without name,"
4270,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,And some orient dawn had found me kneeling
4271,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,on the threshold of the House of Fame.
4272,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,
4273,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,I had sat within that marble circle where the

4275,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,"And the pipe is ever dropping honey, and the"

4280,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,"With ambrosial mouth had kissed my forehead,"

4283,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,"And at springtide, when the apple-blossoms brush"
4284,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,"the burnished bosom of the dove,"
4285,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,Two young lovers lying in an orchard would
4286,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,have read the story of our love.
4287,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,
4288,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,"Would have read the legend of my passion,"

4290,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,"Kissed as we have kissed, but never parted as"

4292,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,
4293,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,For the crimson flower of our life is eaten by
4294,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,"the cankerworm of truth,"
4295,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,And no hand can gather up the fallen withered

4297,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,
4298,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,Yet I am not sorry that I loved you—ah! what

4300,ΓΛΥΚΥΠΙΚΡΟΣ ΕΡΩΣ,"For the hungry teeth of time devour, and the"

5013,THE SPHINX,
5014,THE SPHINX,"Come forth, my lovely seneschal! so somnolent, so statuesque!"
5015,THE SPHINX,Come forth you exquisite grotesque! half woman and half animal!
5016,THE SPHINX,
5017,THE SPHINX,Come forth my lovely languorous Sphinx! and put your head upon my
5018,THE SPHINX,knee!
5019,THE SPHINX,And let me stroke your throat and see your body spotted like the Lynx!
5020,THE SPHINX,
5021,THE SPHINX,And let me touch those curving claws of yellow ivory and grasp
5022,THE SPHINX,The tail that like a monstrous Asp coils round your heavy velvet paws!
5023,THE SPHINX,
5024,THE SPHINX,* * * * *
5025,THE SPHINX,
5026,THE SPHINX,A THOUSAND weary centuries are thine while I have hardly seen
5027,THE SPHINX,Some twenty summers cast their green for Autumn’s gaudy liveries.
5028,THE SPHINX,
5029,THE SPHINX,"But you can read the Hieroglyphs on the great sandstone obelisks,"
5030,THE SPHINX,"And you have talked with Basilisks, and you have looked on"
5031,THE SPHINX,Hippogriffs.
5032,THE SPHINX,
5033,THE SPHINX,"O tell me, were you standing by when Isis to Osiris knelt?"
5034,THE SPHINX,And did you watch the Egyptian melt her union for Antony
5035,THE SPHINX,
5036,THE SPHINX,And drink the jewel-drunken wine and bend her head in mimic awe
5037,THE SPHINX,To see the huge proconsul draw the salted tunny from the brine?
5038,THE SPHINX,
5039,THE SPHINX,And did you mark the Cyprian kiss white Adon on his catafalque?
5040,THE SPHINX,"And did you follow Amenalk, the God of Heliopolis?"
5041,THE SPHINX,
5042,THE SPHINX,"And did you talk with Thoth, and did you hear the moon-horned Io weep?"
5043,THE SPHINX,And know the painted kings who sleep beneath the wedge-shaped Pyramid?
5044,THE SPHINX,
5045,THE SPHINX,* * * * *
5046,THE SPHINX,
5047,THE SPHINX,LIFT up your large black satin eyes which are like cushions where one
5048,THE SPHINX,sinks!
5049,THE SPHINX,"Fawn at my feet, fantastic Sphinx! and sing me all your memories!"
5050,THE SPHINX,
5051,THE SPHINX,"Sing to me of the Jewish maid who wandered with the Holy Child,"
5052,THE SPHINX,"And how you led them through the wild, and how they slept beneath your"
5053,THE SPHINX,shade.
5054,THE SPHINX,
5055,THE SPHINX,Sing to me of that odorous green eve when crouching by the marge
5056,THE SPHINX,You heard from Adrian’s gilded barge the laughter of Antinous
5057,THE SPHINX,
5058,THE SPHINX,And lapped the stream and fed your drouth and watched with hot and
5059,THE SPHINX,hungry stare
5060,THE SPHINX,The ivory body of that rare young slave with his pomegranate mouth!
5061,THE SPHINX,
5062,THE SPHINX,Sing to me of the Labyrinth in which the twi-formed bull was stalled!
5063,THE SPHINX,Sing to me of the night you crawled across the temple’s granite plinth
5064,THE SPHINX,
5065,THE SPHINX,When through the purple corridors the screaming scarlet Ibis flew
5066,THE SPHINX,"In terror, and a horrid dew dripped from the moaning Mandragores,"
5067,THE SPHINX,
5068,THE SPHINX,"And the great torpid crocodile within the tank shed slimy tears,"
5069,THE SPHINX,"And tare the jewels from his ears and staggered back into the Nile,"
5070,THE SPHINX,
5071,THE SPHINX,And the priests cursed you with shrill psalms as in your claws you
5072,THE SPHINX,seized their snake
5073,THE SPHINX,And crept away with it to slake your passion by the shuddering palms.
5074,THE SPHINX,
5075,THE SPHINX,* * * * *
5076,THE SPHINX,
5077,THE SPHINX,WHO were your lovers? who were they who wrestled for you in the dust?
5078,THE SPHINX,"Which was the vessel of your Lust?  What Leman had you, every day?"
5079,THE SPHINX,
5080,THE SPHINX,Did giant Lizards come and crouch before you on the reedy banks?
5081,THE SPHINX,Did Gryphons with great metal flanks leap on you in your trampled
5082,THE SPHINX,couch?
5083,THE SPHINX,
5084,THE SPHINX,Did monstrous hippopotami come sidling toward you in the mist?
5085,THE SPHINX,Did gilt-scaled dragons writhe and twist with passion as you passed
5086,THE SPHINX,them by?
5087,THE SPHINX,
5088,THE SPHINX,And from the brick-built Lycian tomb what horrible Chimera came
5089,THE SPHINX,With fearful heads and fearful flame to breed new wonders from your
5090,THE SPHINX,womb?
5091,THE SPHINX,
5092,THE SPHINX,* * * * *
5093,THE SPHINX,
5094,THE SPHINX,OR had you shameful secret quests and did you harry to your home
5095,THE SPHINX,Some Nereid coiled in amber foam with curious rock crystal breasts?
5096,THE SPHINX,
5097,THE SPHINX,Or did you treading through the froth call to the brown Sidonian
5098,THE SPHINX,"For tidings of Leviathan, Leviathan or Behemoth?"
5099,THE SPHINX,
5100,THE SPHINX,Or did you when the sun was set climb up the cactus-covered slope
5101,THE SPHINX,To meet your swarthy Ethiop whose body was of polished jet?
5102,THE SPHINX,
5103,THE SPHINX,Or did you while the earthen skiffs dropped down the grey Nilotic
5104,THE SPHINX,flats
5105,THE SPHINX,At twilight and the flickering bats flew round the temple’s triple
5106,THE SPHINX,glyphs
5107,THE SPHINX,
5108,THE SPHINX,Steal to the border of the bar and swim across the silent lake
5109,THE SPHINX,And slink into the vault and make the Pyramid your lúpanar
5110,THE SPHINX,
5111,THE SPHINX,Till from each black sarcophagus rose up the painted swathèd dead?
5112,THE SPHINX,Or did you lure unto your bed the ivory-horned Tragelaphos?
5113,THE SPHINX,
5114,THE SPHINX,Or did you love the god of flies who plagued the Hebrews and was
5115,THE SPHINX,splashed
5116,THE SPHINX,"With wine unto the waist? or Pasht, who had green beryls for her eyes?"
5117,THE SPHINX,
5118,THE SPHINX,"Or that young god, the Tyrian, who was more amorous than the dove"
5119,THE SPHINX,Of Ashtaroth? or did you love the god of the Assyrian
5120,THE SPHINX,
5121,THE SPHINX,"Whose wings, like strange transparent talc, rose high above his"
5122,THE SPHINX,"hawk-faced head,"
5123,THE SPHINX,Painted with silver and with red and ribbed with rods of Oreichalch?
5124,THE SPHINX,
5125,THE SPHINX,Or did huge Apis from his car leap down and lay before your feet
5126,THE SPHINX,Big blossoms of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured nenuphar?
5127,THE SPHINX,
5128,THE SPHINX,* * * * *
5129,THE SPHINX,
5130,THE SPHINX,"HOW subtle-secret is your smile!  Did you love none then?  Nay, I know"
5131,THE SPHINX,Great Ammon was your bedfellow!  He lay with you beside the Nile!
5132,THE SPHINX,
5133,THE SPHINX,The river-horses in the slime trumpeted when they saw him come
5134,THE SPHINX,Odorous with Syrian galbanum and smeared with spikenard and with
5135,THE SPHINX,thyme.
5136,THE SPHINX,
5137,THE SPHINX,"He came along the river bank like some tall galley argent-sailed,"
5138,THE SPHINX,"He strode across the waters, mailed in beauty, and the waters sank."
5139,THE SPHINX,
5140,THE SPHINX,He strode across the desert sand: he reached the valley where you lay:
5141,THE SPHINX,He waited till the dawn of day: then touched your black breasts with
5142,THE SPHINX,his hand.
5143,THE SPHINX,
5144,THE SPHINX,You kissed his mouth with mouths of flame: you made the hornèd god
5145,THE SPHINX,your own:
5146,THE SPHINX,You stood behind him on his throne: you called him by his secret name.
5147,THE SPHINX,
5148,THE SPHINX,You whispered monstrous oracles into the caverns of his ears:
5149,THE SPHINX,With blood of goats and blood of steers you taught him monstrous
5150,THE SPHINX,miracles.
5151,THE SPHINX,
5152,THE SPHINX,White Ammon was your bedfellow!  Your chamber was the steaming Nile!
5153,THE SPHINX,And with your curved archaic smile you watched his passion come and
5154,THE SPHINX,go.
5155,THE SPHINX,
5156,THE SPHINX,* * * * *
5157,THE SPHINX,
5158,THE SPHINX,WITH Syrian oils his brows were bright: and wide-spread as a tent at
5159,THE SPHINX,noon
5160,THE SPHINX,His marble limbs made pale the moon and lent the day a larger light.
5161,THE SPHINX,
5162,THE SPHINX,His long hair was nine cubits’ span and coloured like that yellow gem
5163,THE SPHINX,Which hidden in their garment’s hem the merchants bring from
5164,THE SPHINX,Kurdistan.
5165,THE SPHINX,
5166,THE SPHINX,His face was as the must that lies upon a vat of new-made wine:
5167,THE SPHINX,The seas could not insapphirine the perfect azure of his eyes.
5168,THE SPHINX,
5169,THE SPHINX,His thick soft throat was white as milk and threaded with thin veins
5170,THE SPHINX,of blue:
5171,THE SPHINX,And curious pearls like frozen dew were broidered on his flowing silk.
5172,THE SPHINX,
5173,THE SPHINX,* * * * *
5174,THE SPHINX,
5175,THE SPHINX,ON pearl and porphyry pedestalled he was too bright to look upon:
5176,THE SPHINX,"For on his ivory breast there shone the wondrous ocean-emerald,"
5177,THE SPHINX,
5178,THE SPHINX,That mystic moonlit jewel which some diver of the Colchian caves
5179,THE SPHINX,Had found beneath the blackening waves and carried to the Colchian
5180,THE SPHINX,witch.
5181,THE SPHINX,
5182,THE SPHINX,"Before his gilded galiot ran naked vine-wreathed corybants,"
5183,THE SPHINX,"And lines of swaying elephants knelt down to draw his chariot,"
5184,THE SPHINX,
5185,THE SPHINX,And lines of swarthy Nubians bare up his litter as he rode
5186,THE SPHINX,Down the great granite-paven road between the nodding peacock-fans.
5187,THE SPHINX,
5188,THE SPHINX,The merchants brought him steatite from Sidon in their painted ships:
5189,THE SPHINX,The meanest cup that touched his lips was fashioned from a chrysolite.
5190,THE SPHINX,
5191,THE SPHINX,The merchants brought him cedar chests of rich apparel bound with
5192,THE SPHINX,cords:
5193,THE SPHINX,His train was borne by Memphian lords: young kings were glad to be his
5194,THE SPHINX,guests.
5195,THE SPHINX,
5196,THE SPHINX,"Ten hundred shaven priests did bow to Ammon’s altar day and night,"
5197,THE SPHINX,Ten hundred lamps did wave their light through Ammon’s carven
5198,THE SPHINX,house—and now
5199,THE SPHINX,
5200,THE SPHINX,Foul snake and speckled adder with their young ones crawl from stone
5201,THE SPHINX,to stone
5202,THE SPHINX,For ruined is the house and prone the great rose-marble monolith!
5203,THE SPHINX,
5204,THE SPHINX,Wild ass or trotting jackal comes and couches in the mouldering gates:
5205,THE SPHINX,Wild satyrs call unto their mates across the fallen fluted drums.
5206,THE SPHINX,
5207,THE SPHINX,And on the summit of the pile the blue-faced ape of Horus sits
5208,THE SPHINX,And gibbers while the fig-tree splits the pillars of the peristyle
5209,THE SPHINX,
5210,THE SPHINX,* * * * *
5211,THE SPHINX,
5212,THE SPHINX,THE god is scattered here and there: deep hidden in the windy sand
5213,THE SPHINX,I saw his giant granite hand still clenched in impotent despair.
5214,THE SPHINX,
5215,THE SPHINX,"And many a wandering caravan of stately negroes silken-shawled,"
5216,THE SPHINX,"Crossing the desert, halts appalled before the neck that none can"
5217,THE SPHINX,span.
5218,THE SPHINX,
5219,THE SPHINX,And many a bearded Bedouin draws back his yellow-striped burnous
5220,THE SPHINX,To gaze upon the Titan thews of him who was thy paladin.
5221,THE SPHINX,
5222,THE SPHINX,* * * * *
5223,THE SPHINX,
5224,THE SPHINX,"GO, seek his fragments on the moor and wash them in the evening dew,"
5225,THE SPHINX,And from their pieces make anew thy mutilated paramour!
5226,THE SPHINX,
5227,THE SPHINX,"Go, seek them where they lie alone and from their broken pieces make"
5228,THE SPHINX,Thy bruisèd bedfellow!  And wake mad passions in the senseless stone!
5229,THE SPHINX,
5230,THE SPHINX,"Charm his dull ear with Syrian hymns! he loved your body! oh, be kind,"
5231,THE SPHINX,"Pour spikenard on his hair, and wind soft rolls of linen round his"
5232,THE SPHINX,limbs!
5233,THE SPHINX,
5234,THE SPHINX,Wind round his head the figured coins! stain with red fruits those
5235,THE SPHINX,pallid lips!
5236,THE SPHINX,Weave purple for his shrunken hips! and purple for his barren loins!
5237,THE SPHINX,
5238,THE SPHINX,* * * * *
5239,THE SPHINX,
5240,THE SPHINX,AWAY to Egypt!  Have no fear.  Only one God has ever died.
5241,THE SPHINX,Only one God has let His side be wounded by a soldier’s spear.
5242,THE SPHINX,
5243,THE SPHINX,"But these, thy lovers, are not dead.  Still by the hundred-cubit gate"
5244,THE SPHINX,Dog-faced Anubis sits in state with lotus-lilies for thy head.
5245,THE SPHINX,
5246,THE SPHINX,Still from his chair of porphyry gaunt Memnon strains his lidless eyes
5247,THE SPHINX,"Across the empty land, and cries each yellow morning unto thee."
5248,THE SPHINX,
5249,THE SPHINX,And Nilus with his broken horn lies in his black and oozy bed
5250,THE SPHINX,And till thy coming will not spread his waters on the withering corn.
5251,THE SPHINX,
5252,THE SPHINX,"Your lovers are not dead, I know.  They will rise up and hear your"
5253,THE SPHINX,voice
5254,THE SPHINX,And clash their cymbals and rejoice and run to kiss your mouth!  And
5255,THE SPHINX,"so,"
5256,THE SPHINX,
5257,THE SPHINX,Set wings upon your argosies!  Set horses to your ebon car!
5258,THE SPHINX,Back to your Nile!  Or if you are grown sick of dead divinities
5259,THE SPHINX,
5260,THE SPHINX,"Follow some roving lion’s spoor across the copper-coloured plain,"
5261,THE SPHINX,Reach out and hale him by the mane and bid him be your paramour!
5262,THE SPHINX,
5263,THE SPHINX,Couch by his side upon the grass and set your white teeth in his
5264,THE SPHINX,throat
5265,THE SPHINX,And when you hear his dying note lash your long flanks of polished
5266,THE SPHINX,brass
5267,THE SPHINX,
5268,THE SPHINX,"And take a tiger for your mate, whose amber sides are flecked with"
5269,THE SPHINX,"black,"
5270,THE SPHINX,"And ride upon his gilded back in triumph through the Theban gate,"
5271,THE SPHINX,
5272,THE SPHINX,"And toy with him in amorous jests, and when he turns, and snarls, and"
5273,THE SPHINX,"gnaws,"
5274,THE SPHINX,O smite him with your jasper claws! and bruise him with your agate
5275,THE SPHINX,breasts!
5276,THE SPHINX,
5277,THE SPHINX,* * * * *
5278,THE SPHINX,
5279,THE SPHINX,"WHY are you tarrying?  Get hence!  I weary of your sullen ways,"
5280,THE SPHINX,"I weary of your steadfast gaze, your somnolent magnificence."
5281,THE SPHINX,
5282,THE SPHINX,"Your horrible and heavy breath makes the light flicker in the lamp,"
5283,THE SPHINX,And on my brow I feel the damp and dreadful dews of night and death.
5284,THE SPHINX,
5285,THE SPHINX,"Your eyes are like fantastic moons that shiver in some stagnant lake,"
5286,THE SPHINX,"Your tongue is like a scarlet snake that dances to fantastic tunes,"
5287,THE SPHINX,
5288,THE SPHINX,"Your pulse makes poisonous melodies, and your black throat is like the"
5289,THE SPHINX,hole
5290,THE SPHINX,Left by some torch or burning coal on Saracenic tapestries.
5291,THE SPHINX,
5292,THE SPHINX,Away!  The sulphur-coloured stars are hurrying through the Western
5293,THE SPHINX,gate!
5294,THE SPHINX,Away!  Or it may be too late to climb their silent silver cars!
5295,THE SPHINX,
5296,THE SPHINX,"See, the dawn shivers round the grey gilt-dialled towers, and the rain"
5297,THE SPHINX,Streams down each diamonded pane and blurs with tears the wannish day.
5298,THE SPHINX,
5299,THE SPHINX,"What snake-tressed fury fresh from Hell, with uncouth gestures and"
5300,THE SPHINX,"unclean,"
5301,THE SPHINX,Stole from the poppy-drowsy queen and led you to a student’s cell?
5302,THE SPHINX,
5303,THE SPHINX,* * * * *
5304,THE SPHINX,
5305,THE SPHINX,WHAT songless tongueless ghost of sin crept through the curtains of
5306,THE SPHINX,"the night,"
5307,THE SPHINX,"And saw my taper burning bright, and knocked, and bade you enter in?"
5308,THE SPHINX,
5309,THE SPHINX,"Are there not others more accursed, whiter with leprosies than I?"
5310,THE SPHINX,Are Abana and Pharphar dry that you come here to slake your thirst?
5311,THE SPHINX,
5312,THE SPHINX,"Get hence, you loathsome mystery!  Hideous animal, get hence!"
5313,THE SPHINX,"You wake in me each bestial sense, you make me what I would not be."
5314,THE SPHINX,
5315,THE SPHINX,"You make my creed a barren sham, you wake foul dreams of sensual life,"
5316,THE SPHINX,And Atys with his blood-stained knife were better than the thing I am.
5317,THE SPHINX,
5318,THE SPHINX,"False Sphinx!  False Sphinx!  By reedy Styx old Charon, leaning on his"

5320,THE SPHINX,"Waits for my coin.  Go thou before, and leave me to my crucifix,"
5321,THE SPHINX,
5322,THE SPHINX,"Whose pallid burden, sick with pain, watches the world with wearied"

5345,I,"HE did not wear his scarlet coat,"
5346,I,"For blood and wine are red,"
5347,I,And blood and wine were on his hands
5348,I,"When they found him with the dead,"
5349,I,"The poor dead woman whom he loved,"
5350,I,And murdered in her bed.
5351,I,
5352,I,He walked amongst the Trial Men
5353,I,In a suit of shabby grey;
5354,I,"A cricket cap was on his head,"
5355,I,And his step seemed light and gay;
5356,I,But I never saw a man who looked
5357,I,So wistfully at the day.
5358,I,
5359,I,I never saw a man who looked
5360,I,With such a wistful eye
5361,I,Upon that little tent of blue
5362,I,"Which prisoners call the sky,"
5363,I,And at every drifting cloud that went
5364,I,With sails of silver by.
5365,I,
5366,I,"I walked, with other souls in pain,"
5367,I,"Within another ring,"
5368,I,And was wondering if the man had done
5369,I,"A great or little thing,"
5370,I,"When a voice behind me whispered low,"
5371,I,‘_That fellow’s got to swing_.’
5372,I,
5373,I,Dear Christ! the very prison walls
5374,I,"Suddenly seemed to reel,"
5375,I,And the sky above my head became
5376,I,Like a casque of scorching steel;
5377,I,"And, though I was a soul in pain,"
5378,I,My pain I could not feel.
5379,I,
5380,I,I only knew what hunted thought
5381,I,"Quickened his step, and why"
5382,I,He looked upon the garish day
5383,I,With such a wistful eye;
5384,I,"The man had killed the thing he loved,"
5385,I,And so he had to die.
5386,I,
5387,I,[Picture: Decorative graphic]

5389,I,"Yet each man kills the thing he loves,"

5392,I,"Some with a flattering word,"
5393,I,"The coward does it with a kiss,"
5394,I,The brave man with a sword!
5395,I,

5412,I,"Nor have a noose about his neck,"
5413,I,"Nor a cloth upon his face,"
5414,I,Nor drop feet foremost through the floor
5415,I,Into an empty space.
5416,I,
5417,I,[Picture: Decorative graphic]
5418,I,
5419,I,He does not sit with silent men
5420,I,Who watch him night and day;
5421,I,"Who watch him when he tries to weep,"
5422,I,And when he tries to pray;
5423,I,Who watch him lest himself should rob
5424,I,The prison of its prey.
5425,I,
5426,I,He does not wake at dawn to see
5427,I,"Dread figures throng his room,"
5428,I,"The shivering Chaplain robed in white,"
5429,I,"The Sheriff stern with gloom,"
5430,I,"And the Governor all in shiny black,"
5431,I,With the yellow face of Doom.
5432,I,
5433,I,He does not rise in piteous haste
5434,I,"To put on convict-clothes,"
5435,I,"While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes"
5436,I,"Each new and nerve-twitched pose,"
5437,I,Fingering a watch whose little ticks
5438,I,Are like horrible hammer-blows.
5439,I,
5440,I,He does not know that sickening thirst
5441,I,"That sands one’s throat, before"
5442,I,The hangman with his gardener’s gloves
5443,I,"Slips through the padded door,"
5444,I,"And binds one with three leathern thongs,"
5445,I,That the throat may thirst no more.
5446,I,
5447,I,He does not bend his head to hear
5448,I,"The Burial Office read,"
5449,I,"Nor, while the terror of his soul"
5450,I,"Tells him he is not dead,"
5451,I,"Cross his own coffin, as he moves"
5452,I,Into the hideous shed.
5453,I,
5454,I,He does not stare upon the air
5455,I,Through a little roof of glass:
5456,I,He does not pray with lips of clay
5457,I,For his agony to pass;
5458,I,Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek
5459,I,The kiss of Caiaphas.
5460,I,
5461,II,II
5462,II,
5463,II,"SIX weeks our guardsman walked the yard,"
5464,II,In the suit of shabby grey:
5465,II,"His cricket cap was on his head,"
5466,II,"And his step seemed light and gay,"
5467,II,But I never saw a man who looked
5468,II,So wistfully at the day.
5469,II,
5470,II,I never saw a man who looked
5471,II,With such a wistful eye
5472,II,Upon that little tent of blue
5473,II,"Which prisoners call the sky,"
5474,II,And at every wandering cloud that trailed
5475,II,Its ravelled fleeces by.
5476,II,
5477,II,"He did not wring his hands, as do"
5478,II,Those witless men who dare
5479,II,To try to rear the changeling Hope
5480,II,In the cave of black Despair:
5481,II,"He only looked upon the sun,"
5482,II,And drank the morning air.
5483,II,
5484,II,"He did not wring his hands nor weep,"
5485,II,"Nor did he peek or pine,"
5486,II,But he drank the air as though it held
5487,II,Some healthful anodyne;
5488,II,With open mouth he drank the sun
5489,II,As though it had been wine!
5490,II,
5491,II,"And I and all the souls in pain,"
5492,II,"Who tramped the other ring,"
5493,II,Forgot if we ourselves had done
5494,II,"A great or little thing,"
5495,II,And watched with gaze of dull amaze
5496,II,The man who had to swing.
5497,II,
5498,II,And strange it was to see him pass
5499,II,"With a step so light and gay,"
5500,II,And strange it was to see him look
5501,II,"So wistfully at the day,"
5502,II,And strange it was to think that he
5503,II,Had such a debt to pay.
5504,II,
5505,II,[Picture: Decorative graphic]
5506,II,
5507,II,For oak and elm have pleasant leaves
5508,II,That in the springtime shoot:
5509,II,"But grim to see is the gallows-tree,"
5510,II,"With its adder-bitten root,"
5511,II,"And, green or dry, a man must die"
5512,II,Before it bears its fruit!
5513,II,
5514,II,The loftiest place is that seat of grace
5515,II,For which all worldlings try:
5516,II,But who would stand in hempen band
5517,II,"Upon a scaffold high,"
5518,II,And through a murderer’s collar take
5519,II,His last look at the sky?
5520,II,
5521,II,It is sweet to dance to violins
5522,II,When Love and Life are fair:
5523,II,"To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes"
5524,II,Is delicate and rare:
5525,II,But it is not sweet with nimble feet
5526,II,To dance upon the air!
5527,II,
5528,II,So with curious eyes and sick surmise
5529,II,"We watched him day by day,"
5530,II,And wondered if each one of us
5531,II,"Would end the self-same way,"
5532,II,For none can tell to what red Hell
5533,II,His sightless soul may stray.
5534,II,
5535,II,At last the dead man walked no more
5536,II,"Amongst the Trial Men,"
5537,II,And I knew that he was standing up
5538,II,"In the black dock’s dreadful pen,"
5539,II,And that never would I see his face
5540,II,In God’s sweet world again.
5541,II,
5542,II,Like two doomed ships that pass in storm
5543,II,We had crossed each other’s way:
5544,II,"But we made no sign, we said no word,"
5545,II,We had no word to say;
5546,II,"For we did not meet in the holy night,"
5547,II,But in the shameful day.
5548,II,
5549,II,"A prison wall was round us both,"
5550,II,Two outcast men we were:
5551,II,"The world had thrust us from its heart,"
5552,II,And God from out His care:
5553,II,And the iron gin that waits for Sin
5554,II,Had caught us in its snare.
5555,II,
5556,III,III
5557,III,
5558,III,"IN Debtors’ Yard the stones are hard,"
5559,III,"And the dripping wall is high,"
5560,III,So it was there he took the air
5561,III,"Beneath the leaden sky,"
5562,III,"And by each side a Warder walked,"
5563,III,For fear the man might die.
5564,III,
5565,III,Or else he sat with those who watched
5566,III,His anguish night and day;
5567,III,"Who watched him when he rose to weep,"
5568,III,And when he crouched to pray;
5569,III,Who watched him lest himself should rob
5570,III,Their scaffold of its prey.
5571,III,
5572,III,The Governor was strong upon
5573,III,The Regulations Act:
5574,III,The Doctor said that Death was but
5575,III,A scientific fact:
5576,III,"And twice a day the Chaplain called,"
5577,III,And left a little tract.
5578,III,
5579,III,"And twice a day he smoked his pipe,"
5580,III,And drank his quart of beer:
5581,III,"His soul was resolute, and held"
5582,III,No hiding-place for fear;
5583,III,He often said that he was glad
5584,III,The hangman’s hands were near.
5585,III,
5586,III,But why he said so strange a thing
5587,III,No Warder dared to ask:
5588,III,For he to whom a watcher’s doom
5589,III,"Is given as his task,"
5590,III,"Must set a lock upon his lips,"
5591,III,And make his face a mask.
5592,III,
5593,III,"Or else he might be moved, and try"
5594,III,To comfort or console:
5595,III,And what should Human Pity do
5596,III,Pent up in Murderers’ Hole?
5597,III,What word of grace in such a place
5598,III,Could help a brother’s soul?
5599,III,
5600,III,[Picture: Decorative graphic]
5601,III,
5602,III,With slouch and swing around the ring
5603,III,We trod the Fools’ Parade!
5604,III,We did not care: we knew we were
5605,III,The Devil’s Own Brigade:
5606,III,And shaven head and feet of lead
5607,III,Make a merry masquerade.
5608,III,
5609,III,We tore the tarry rope to shreds
5610,III,With blunt and bleeding nails;
5611,III,"We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,"
5612,III,And cleaned the shining rails:
5613,III,"And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,"
5614,III,And clattered with the pails.
5615,III,
5616,III,"We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,"
5617,III,We turned the dusty drill:
5618,III,"We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,"
5619,III,And sweated on the mill:
5620,III,But in the heart of every man
5621,III,Terror was lying still.
5622,III,
5623,III,So still it lay that every day
5624,III,Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:
5625,III,And we forgot the bitter lot
5626,III,"That waits for fool and knave,"
5627,III,"Till once, as we tramped in from work,"
5628,III,We passed an open grave.
5629,III,
5630,III,With yawning mouth the yellow hole
5631,III,Gaped for a living thing;
5632,III,The very mud cried out for blood
5633,III,To the thirsty asphalte ring:
5634,III,And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair
5635,III,Some prisoner had to swing.
5636,III,
5637,III,"Right in we went, with soul intent"
5638,III,On Death and Dread and Doom:
5639,III,"The hangman, with his little bag,"
5640,III,Went shuffling through the gloom:
5641,III,And each man trembled as he crept
5642,III,Into his numbered tomb.
5643,III,
5644,III,[Picture: Decorative graphic]
5645,III,
5646,III,That night the empty corridors
5647,III,"Were full of forms of Fear,"
5648,III,And up and down the iron town
5649,III,"Stole feet we could not hear,"
5650,III,And through the bars that hide the stars
5651,III,White faces seemed to peer.
5652,III,
5653,III,He lay as one who lies and dreams
5654,III,"In a pleasant meadow-land,"
5655,III,"The watchers watched him as he slept,"
5656,III,And could not understand
5657,III,How one could sleep so sweet a sleep
5658,III,With a hangman close at hand.
5659,III,
5660,III,But there is no sleep when men must weep
5661,III,Who never yet have wept:
5662,III,"So we—the fool, the fraud, the knave—"
5663,III,"That endless vigil kept,"
5664,III,And through each brain on hands of pain
5665,III,Another’s terror crept.
5666,III,
5667,III,Alas! it is a fearful thing
5668,III,To feel another’s guilt!
5669,III,"For, right within, the sword of Sin"
5670,III,"Pierced to its poisoned hilt,"
5671,III,And as molten lead were the tears we shed
5672,III,For the blood we had not spilt.
5673,III,
5674,III,The Warders with their shoes of felt
5675,III,"Crept by each padlocked door,"
5676,III,"And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,"
5677,III,"Grey figures on the floor,"
5678,III,And wondered why men knelt to pray
5679,III,Who never prayed before.
5680,III,
5681,III,"All through the night we knelt and prayed,"
5682,III,Mad mourners of a corse!
5683,III,The troubled plumes of midnight were
5684,III,The plumes upon a hearse:
5685,III,And bitter wine upon a sponge
5686,III,Was the savour of Remorse.
5687,III,
5688,III,* * * * *
5689,III,
5690,III,"The grey cock crew, the red cock crew,"
5691,III,But never came the day:
5692,III,"And crooked shapes of Terror crouched,"
5693,III,In the corners where we lay:
5694,III,And each evil sprite that walks by night
5695,III,Before us seemed to play.
5696,III,
5697,III,"They glided past, they glided fast,"
5698,III,Like travellers through a mist:
5699,III,They mocked the moon in a rigadoon
5700,III,"Of delicate turn and twist,"
5701,III,And with formal pace and loathsome grace
5702,III,The phantoms kept their tryst.
5703,III,
5704,III,"With mop and mow, we saw them go,"
5705,III,Slim shadows hand in hand:
5706,III,"About, about, in ghostly rout"
5707,III,They trod a saraband:
5708,III,"And the damned grotesques made arabesques,"
5709,III,Like the wind upon the sand!
5710,III,
5711,III,"With the pirouettes of marionettes,"
5712,III,They tripped on pointed tread:
5713,III,"But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,"
5714,III,"As their grisly masque they led,"
5715,III,"And loud they sang, and long they sang,"
5716,III,For they sang to wake the dead.
5717,III,
5718,III,"‘_Oho_!’ _they cried_, ‘_The world is wide_,"
5719,III,_But fettered limbs go lame_!
5720,III,"_And once_, _or twice_, _to throw the dice_"
5721,III,"_Is a gentlemanly game_,"
5722,III,_But he does not win who plays with Sin_
5723,III,_In the secret House of Shame_.’
5724,III,
5725,III,"No things of air these antics were,"
5726,III,That frolicked with such glee:
5727,III,"To men whose lives were held in gyves,"
5728,III,"And whose feet might not go free,"
5729,III,"Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,"
5730,III,Most terrible to see.
5731,III,
5732,III,"Around, around, they waltzed and wound;"
5733,III,Some wheeled in smirking pairs;
5734,III,With the mincing step of a demirep
5735,III,Some sidled up the stairs:
5736,III,"And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,"
5737,III,Each helped us at our prayers.
5738,III,
5739,III,"The morning wind began to moan,"
5740,III,But still the night went on:
5741,III,Through its giant loom the web of gloom
5742,III,Crept till each thread was spun:
5743,III,"And, as we prayed, we grew afraid"
5744,III,Of the Justice of the Sun.
5745,III,
5746,III,The moaning wind went wandering round
5747,III,The weeping prison-wall:
5748,III,Till like a wheel of turning steel
5749,III,We felt the minutes crawl:
5750,III,O moaning wind! what had we done
5751,III,To have such a seneschal?
5752,III,
5753,III,"At last I saw the shadowed bars,"
5754,III,"Like a lattice wrought in lead,"
5755,III,Move right across the whitewashed wall
5756,III,"That faced my three-plank bed,"
5757,III,And I knew that somewhere in the world
5758,III,God’s dreadful dawn was red.
5759,III,
5760,III,"At six o’clock we cleaned our cells,"
5761,III,"At seven all was still,"
5762,III,But the sough and swing of a mighty wing
5763,III,"The prison seemed to fill,"
5764,III,For the Lord of Death with icy breath
5765,III,Had entered in to kill.
5766,III,
5767,III,"He did not pass in purple pomp,"
5768,III,Nor ride a moon-white steed.
5769,III,Three yards of cord and a sliding board
5770,III,Are all the gallows’ need:
5771,III,So with rope of shame the Herald came
5772,III,To do the secret deed.
5773,III,
5774,III,We were as men who through a fen
5775,III,Of filthy darkness grope:
5776,III,"We did not dare to breathe a prayer,"
5777,III,Or to give our anguish scope:
5778,III,"Something was dead in each of us,"
5779,III,And what was dead was Hope.
5780,III,
5781,III,"For Man’s grim Justice goes its way,"
5782,III,And will not swerve aside:
5783,III,"It slays the weak, it slays the strong,"
5784,III,It has a deadly stride:
5785,III,"With iron heel it slays the strong,"
5786,III,The monstrous parricide!
5787,III,
5788,III,We waited for the stroke of eight:
5789,III,Each tongue was thick with thirst:
5790,III,For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate
5791,III,"That makes a man accursed,"
5792,III,And Fate will use a running noose
5793,III,For the best man and the worst.
5794,III,
5795,III,"We had no other thing to do,"
5796,III,Save to wait for the sign to come:
5797,III,"So, like things of stone in a valley lone,"
5798,III,Quiet we sat and dumb:
5799,III,"But each man’s heart beat thick and quick,"
5800,III,Like a madman on a drum!
5801,III,
5802,III,With sudden shock the prison-clock
5803,III,"Smote on the shivering air,"
5804,III,And from all the gaol rose up a wail
5805,III,"Of impotent despair,"
5806,III,Like the sound that frightened marshes hear
5807,III,From some leper in his lair.
5808,III,
5809,III,And as one sees most fearful things
5810,III,"In the crystal of a dream,"
5811,III,We saw the greasy hempen rope
5812,III,"Hooked to the blackened beam,"
5813,III,And heard the prayer the hangman’s snare
5814,III,Strangled into a scream.
5815,III,
5816,III,And all the woe that moved him so
5817,III,"That he gave that bitter cry,"
5818,III,"And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,"
5819,III,None knew so well as I:
5820,III,For he who lives more lives than one
5821,III,More deaths than one must die.
5822,III,
5823,IV,IV
5824,IV,
5825,IV,THERE is no chapel on the day
5826,IV,On which they hang a man:
5827,IV,"The Chaplain’s heart is far too sick,"
5828,IV,"Or his face is far too wan,"
5829,IV,Or there is that written in his eyes
5830,IV,Which none should look upon.
5831,IV,
5832,IV,"So they kept us close till nigh on noon,"
5833,IV,"And then they rang the bell,"
5834,IV,And the Warders with their jingling keys
5835,IV,"Opened each listening cell,"
5836,IV,"And down the iron stair we tramped,"
5837,IV,Each from his separate Hell.
5838,IV,
5839,IV,"Out into God’s sweet air we went,"
5840,IV,"But not in wonted way,"
5841,IV,"For this man’s face was white with fear,"
5842,IV,"And that man’s face was grey,"
5843,IV,And I never saw sad men who looked
5844,IV,So wistfully at the day.
5845,IV,
5846,IV,I never saw sad men who looked
5847,IV,With such a wistful eye
5848,IV,Upon that little tent of blue
5849,IV,"We prisoners called the sky,"
5850,IV,And at every careless cloud that passed
5851,IV,In happy freedom by.
5852,IV,
5853,IV,But there were those amongst us all
5854,IV,"Who walked with downcast head,"
5855,IV,"And knew that, had each got his due,"
5856,IV,They should have died instead:
5857,IV,"He had but killed a thing that lived,"
5858,IV,Whilst they had killed the dead.
5859,IV,
5860,IV,For he who sins a second time
5861,IV,"Wakes a dead soul to pain,"
5862,IV,"And draws it from its spotted shroud,"
5863,IV,"And makes it bleed again,"
5864,IV,"And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,"
5865,IV,And makes it bleed in vain!
5866,IV,
5867,IV,[Picture: Decorative graphic]
5868,IV,
5869,IV,"Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb"
5870,IV,"With crooked arrows starred,"
5871,IV,Silently we went round and round
5872,IV,The slippery asphalte yard;
5873,IV,"Silently we went round and round,"
5874,IV,And no man spoke a word.
5875,IV,
5876,IV,"Silently we went round and round,"
5877,IV,And through each hollow mind
5878,IV,The Memory of dreadful things
5879,IV,"Rushed like a dreadful wind,"
5880,IV,"And Horror stalked before each man,"
5881,IV,And Terror crept behind.
5882,IV,
5883,IV,[Picture: Decorative graphic]
5884,IV,
5885,IV,"The Warders strutted up and down,"
5886,IV,"And kept their herd of brutes,"
5887,IV,"Their uniforms were spick and span,"
5888,IV,"And they wore their Sunday suits,"
5889,IV,"But we knew the work they had been at,"
5890,IV,By the quicklime on their boots.
5891,IV,
5892,IV,"For where a grave had opened wide,"
5893,IV,There was no grave at all:
5894,IV,Only a stretch of mud and sand
5895,IV,"By the hideous prison-wall,"
5896,IV,"And a little heap of burning lime,"
5897,IV,That the man should have his pall.
5898,IV,
5899,IV,"For he has a pall, this wretched man,"
5900,IV,Such as few men can claim:
5901,IV,"Deep down below a prison-yard,"
5902,IV,"Naked for greater shame,"
5903,IV,"He lies, with fetters on each foot,"
5904,IV,Wrapt in a sheet of flame!
5905,IV,
5906,IV,And all the while the burning lime
5907,IV,"Eats flesh and bone away,"
5908,IV,"It eats the brittle bone by night,"
5909,IV,"And the soft flesh by day,"
5910,IV,"It eats the flesh and bone by turns,"
5911,IV,But it eats the heart alway.

5914,IV,
5915,IV,For three long years they will not sow
5916,IV,Or root or seedling there:
5917,IV,For three long years the unblessed spot
5918,IV,"Will sterile be and bare,"
5919,IV,And look upon the wondering sky
5920,IV,With unreproachful stare.
5921,IV,
5922,IV,They think a murderer’s heart would taint
5923,IV,Each simple seed they sow.
5924,IV,It is not true!  God’s kindly earth
5925,IV,"Is kindlier than men know,"
5926,IV,"And the red rose would but blow more red,"
5927,IV,The white rose whiter blow.
5928,IV,
5929,IV,"Out of his mouth a red, red rose!"
5930,IV,Out of his heart a white!
5931,IV,"For who can say by what strange way,"
5932,IV,"Christ brings His will to light,"
5933,IV,Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore
5934,IV,Bloomed in the great Pope’s sight?
5935,IV,
5936,IV,But neither milk-white rose nor red
5937,IV,May bloom in prison-air;
5938,IV,"The shard, the pebble, and the flint,"
5939,IV,Are what they give us there:
5940,IV,For flowers have been known to heal
5941,IV,A common man’s despair.
5942,IV,
5943,IV,"So never will wine-red rose or white,"
5944,IV,"Petal by petal, fall"
5945,IV,On that stretch of mud and sand that lies
5946,IV,"By the hideous prison-wall,"
5947,IV,To tell the men who tramp the yard
5948,IV,That God’s Son died for all.
5949,IV,
5950,IV,[Picture: Decorative graphic]
5951,IV,
5952,IV,Yet though the hideous prison-wall
5953,IV,"Still hems him round and round,"
5954,IV,And a spirit may not walk by night
5955,IV,"That is with fetters bound,"
5956,IV,And a spirit may but weep that lies
5957,IV,"In such unholy ground,"
5958,IV,
5959,IV,He is at peace—this wretched man—
5960,IV,"At peace, or will be soon:"
5961,IV,"There is no thing to make him mad,"
5962,IV,"Nor does Terror walk at noon,"
5963,IV,For the lampless Earth in which he lies
5964,IV,Has neither Sun nor Moon.
5965,IV,
5966,IV,They hanged him as a beast is hanged:
5967,IV,They did not even toll
5968,IV,A requiem that might have brought
5969,IV,"Rest to his startled soul,"
5970,IV,"But hurriedly they took him out,"
5971,IV,And hid him in a hole.
5972,IV,
5973,IV,"They stripped him of his canvas clothes,"
5974,IV,And gave him to the flies:
5975,IV,"They mocked the swollen purple throat,"
5976,IV,And the stark and staring eyes:
5977,IV,And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud
5978,IV,In which their convict lies.
5979,IV,
5980,IV,The Chaplain would not kneel to pray
5981,IV,By his dishonoured grave:
5982,IV,Nor mark it with that blessed Cross
5983,IV,"That Christ for sinners gave,"
5984,IV,Because the man was one of those
5985,IV,Whom Christ came down to save.
5986,IV,
5987,IV,Yet all is well; he has but passed
5988,IV,To Life’s appointed bourne:
5989,IV,And alien tears will fill for him
5990,IV,"Pity’s long-broken urn,"
5991,IV,"For his mourners will be outcast men,"
5992,IV,And outcasts always mourn
5993,IV,
5994,V,V
5995,V,
5996,V,"I KNOW not whether Laws be right,"
5997,V,Or whether Laws be wrong;
5998,V,All that we know who lie in gaol
5999,V,Is that the wall is strong;
6000,V,"And that each day is like a year,"
6001,V,A year whose days are long.
6002,V,
6003,V,"But this I know, that every Law"
6004,V,"That men have made for Man,"
6005,V,"Since first Man took his brother’s life,"
6006,V,"And the sad world began,"
6007,V,But straws the wheat and saves the chaff
6008,V,With a most evil fan.
6009,V,
6010,V,This too I know—and wise it were
6011,V,If each could know the same—
6012,V,That every prison that men build
6013,V,"Is built with bricks of shame,"
6014,V,And bound with bars lest Christ should see
6015,V,How men their brothers maim.
6016,V,
6017,V,"With bars they blur the gracious moon,"
6018,V,And blind the goodly sun:
6019,V,"And they do well to hide their Hell,"
6020,V,For in it things are done
6021,V,That Son of God nor son of Man
6022,V,Ever should look upon!
6023,V,
6024,V,[Picture: Decorative graphic]
6025,V,
6026,V,"The vilest deeds like poison weeds,"
6027,V,Bloom well in prison-air;
6028,V,It is only what is good in Man
6029,V,That wastes and withers there:
6030,V,"Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,"
6031,V,And the Warder is Despair.
6032,V,
6033,V,For they starve the little frightened child
6034,V,Till it weeps both night and day:
6035,V,"And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,"
6036,V,"And gibe the old and grey,"
6037,V,"And some grow mad, and all grow bad,"
6038,V,And none a word may say.
6039,V,
6040,V,Each narrow cell in which we dwell
6041,V,"Is a foul and dark latrine,"
6042,V,And the fetid breath of living Death
6043,V,"Chokes up each grated screen,"
6044,V,"And all, but Lust, is turned to dust"
6045,V,In Humanity’s machine.
6046,V,
6047,V,The brackish water that we drink
6048,V,"Creeps with a loathsome slime,"
6049,V,And the bitter bread they weigh in scales
6050,V,"Is full of chalk and lime,"
6051,V,"And Sleep will not lie down, but walks"
6052,V,"Wild-eyed, and cries to Time."
6053,V,
6054,V,[Picture: Decorative graphic]
6055,V,
6056,V,But though lean Hunger and green Thirst
6057,V,"Like asp with adder fight,"
6058,V,"We have little care of prison fare,"
6059,V,For what chills and kills outright
6060,V,Is that every stone one lifts by day
6061,V,Becomes one’s heart by night.
6062,V,
6063,V,"With midnight always in one’s heart,"
6064,V,"And twilight in one’s cell,"
6065,V,"We turn the crank, or tear the rope,"
6066,V,"Each in his separate Hell,"
6067,V,And the silence is more awful far
6068,V,Than the sound of a brazen bell.
6069,V,
6070,V,And never a human voice comes near
6071,V,To speak a gentle word:
6072,V,And the eye that watches through the door
6073,V,Is pitiless and hard:
6074,V,"And by all forgot, we rot and rot,"
6075,V,With soul and body marred.
6076,V,
6077,V,And thus we rust Life’s iron chain
6078,V,Degraded and alone:
6079,V,"And some men curse, and some men weep,"
6080,V,And some men make no moan:
6081,V,But God’s eternal Laws are kind
6082,V,And break the heart of stone.
6083,V,
6084,V,[Picture: Decorative graphic]
6085,V,
6086,V,"And every human heart that breaks,"
6087,V,"In prison-cell or yard,"
6088,V,Is as that broken box that gave
6089,V,"Its treasure to the Lord,"
6090,V,And filled the unclean leper’s house
6091,V,With the scent of costliest nard.
6092,V,
6093,V,Ah! happy they whose hearts can break
6094,V,And peace of pardon win!
6095,V,How else may man make straight his plan
6096,V,And cleanse his soul from Sin?
6097,V,How else but through a broken heart
6098,V,May Lord Christ enter in?
6099,V,
6100,V,[Picture: Decorative graphic]
6101,V,
6102,V,"And he of the swollen purple throat,"
6103,V,"And the stark and staring eyes,"
6104,V,Waits for the holy hands that took
6105,V,The Thief to Paradise;
6106,V,And a broken and a contrite heart
6107,V,The Lord will not despise.
6108,V,
6109,V,The man in red who reads the Law
6110,V,"Gave him three weeks of life,"
6111,V,Three little weeks in which to heal
6112,V,"His soul of his soul’s strife,"
6113,V,And cleanse from every blot of blood
6114,V,The hand that held the knife.
6115,V,
6116,V,"And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,"
6117,V,The hand that held the steel:
6118,V,"For only blood can wipe out blood,"
6119,V,And only tears can heal:
6120,V,And the crimson stain that was of Cain
6121,V,Became Christ’s snow-white seal.

6125,VI,IN Reading gaol by Reading town
6126,VI,"There is a pit of shame,"
6127,VI,And in it lies a wretched man
6128,VI,"Eaten by teeth of flame,"
6129,VI,"In a burning winding-sheet he lies,"
6130,VI,And his grave has got no name.
6131,VI,
6132,VI,"And there, till Christ call forth the dead,"
6133,VI,In silence let him lie:
6134,VI,"No need to waste the foolish tear,"
6135,VI,Or heave the windy sigh:
6136,VI,"The man had killed the thing he loved,"
6137,VI,And so he had to die.
6138,VI,
6139,VI,"And all men kill the thing they love,"

6173,I.,
6174,I.,"A YEAR ago I breathed the Italian air,—"
6175,I.,"And yet, methinks this northern Spring is fair,—"
6176,I.,"These fields made golden with the flower of March,"
6177,I.,"The throstle singing on the feathered larch,"
6178,I.,"The cawing rooks, the wood-doves fluttering by,"
6179,I.,The little clouds that race across the sky;
6180,I.,"And fair the violet’s gentle drooping head,"
6181,I.,"The primrose, pale for love uncomforted,"
6182,I.,"The rose that burgeons on the climbing briar,"
6183,I.,"The crocus-bed, (that seems a moon of fire"
6184,I.,Round-girdled with a purple marriage-ring);
6185,I.,"And all the flowers of our English Spring,"
6186,I.,"Fond snowdrops, and the bright-starred daffodil."
6187,I.,"Up starts the lark beside the murmuring mill,"
6188,I.,And breaks the gossamer-threads of early dew;
6189,I.,"And down the river, like a flame of blue,"
6190,I.,"Keen as an arrow flies the water-king,"
6191,I.,While the brown linnets in the greenwood sing.
6192,I.,A year ago!—it seems a little time
6193,I.,"Since last I saw that lordly southern clime,"
6194,I.,"Where flower and fruit to purple radiance blow,"
6195,I.,And like bright lamps the fabled apples glow.
6196,I.,"Full Spring it was—and by rich flowering vines,"
6197,I.,"Dark olive-groves and noble forest-pines,"
6198,I.,"I rode at will; the moist glad air was sweet,"
6199,I.,"The white road rang beneath my horse’s feet,"
6200,I.,"And musing on Ravenna’s ancient name,"
6201,I.,"I watched the day till, marked with wounds of flame,"
6202,I.,The turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned.
6203,I.,
6204,I.,"O how my heart with boyish passion burned,"
6205,I.,When far away across the sedge and mere
6206,I.,"I saw that Holy City rising clear,"
6207,I.,Crowned with her crown of towers!—On and on
6208,I.,"I galloped, racing with the setting sun,"
6209,I.,"And ere the crimson after-glow was passed,"
6210,I.,I stood within Ravenna’s walls at last!
6211,I.,
6212,II.,II.
6213,II.,
6214,II.,How strangely still! no sound of life or joy
6215,II.,Startles the air; no laughing shepherd-boy
6216,II.,"Pipes on his reed, nor ever through the day"
6217,II.,Comes the glad sound of children at their play:
6218,II.,"O sad, and sweet, and silent! surely here"
6219,II.,"A man might dwell apart from troublous fear,"
6220,II.,Watching the tide of seasons as they flow
6221,II.,"From amorous Spring to Winter’s rain and snow,"
6222,II.,"And have no thought of sorrow;—here, indeed,"
6223,II.,"Are Lethe’s waters, and that fatal weed"
6224,II.,Which makes a man forget his fatherland.
6225,II.,
6226,II.,"Ay! amid lotus-meadows dost thou stand,"
6227,II.,"Like Proserpine, with poppy-laden head,"
6228,II.,Guarding the holy ashes of the dead.
6229,II.,"For though thy brood of warrior sons hath ceased,"
6230,II.,Thy noble dead are with thee!—they at least
6231,II.,"Are faithful to thine honour:—guard them well,"
6232,II.,"O childless city! for a mighty spell,"
6233,II.,"To wake men’s hearts to dreams of things sublime,"
6234,II.,Are the lone tombs where rest the Great of Time.
6235,II.,
6236,III.,III.
6237,III.,
6238,III.,"Yon lonely pillar, rising on the plain,"
6239,III.,"Marks where the bravest knight of France was slain,—"
6240,III.,"The Prince of chivalry, the Lord of war,"
6241,III.,Gaston de Foix: for some untimely star
6242,III.,"Led him against thy city, and he fell,"
6243,III.,As falls some forest-lion fighting well.
6244,III.,"Taken from life while life and love were new,"
6245,III.,He lies beneath God’s seamless veil of blue;
6246,III.,"Tall lance-like reeds wave sadly o’er his head,"
6247,III.,"And oleanders bloom to deeper red,"
6248,III.,Where his bright youth flowed crimson on the ground.
6249,III.,
6250,III.,"Look farther north unto that broken mound,—"
6251,III.,"There, prisoned now within a lordly tomb"
6252,III.,"Raised by a daughter’s hand, in lonely gloom,"
6253,III.,"Huge-limbed Theodoric, the Gothic king,"
6254,III.,Sleeps after all his weary conquering.
6255,III.,"Time hath not spared his ruin,—wind and rain"
6256,III.,Have broken down his stronghold; and again
6257,III.,"We see that Death is mighty lord of all,"
6258,III.,And king and clown to ashen dust must fall
6259,III.,
6260,III.,Mighty indeed _their_ glory! yet to me
6261,III.,"Barbaric king, or knight of chivalry,"
6262,III.,"Or the great queen herself, were poor and vain,"
6263,III.,Beside the grave where Dante rests from pain.
6264,III.,His gilded shrine lies open to the air;
6265,III.,And cunning sculptor’s hands have carven there
6266,III.,"The calm white brow, as calm as earliest morn,"
6267,III.,"The eyes that flashed with passionate love and scorn,"
6268,III.,"The lips that sang of Heaven and of Hell,"
6269,III.,"The almond-face which Giotto drew so well,"
6270,III.,"The weary face of Dante;—to this day,"
6271,III.,"Here in his place of resting, far away"
6272,III.,"From Arno’s yellow waters, rushing down"
6273,III.,"Through the wide bridges of that fairy town,"
6274,III.,Where the tall tower of Giotto seems to rise
6275,III.,A marble lily under sapphire skies!
6276,III.,
6277,III.,Alas! my Dante! thou hast known the pain
6278,III.,"Of meaner lives,—the exile’s galling chain,"
6279,III.,"How steep the stairs within kings’ houses are,"
6280,III.,And all the petty miseries which mar
6281,III.,Man’s nobler nature with the sense of wrong.
6282,III.,Yet this dull world is grateful for thy song;
6283,III.,"Our nations do thee homage,—even she,"
6284,III.,"That cruel queen of vine-clad Tuscany,"
6285,III.,"Who bound with crown of thorns thy living brow,"
6286,III.,"Hath decked thine empty tomb with laurels now,"
6287,III.,And begs in vain the ashes of her son.
6288,III.,
6289,III.,O mightiest exile! all thy grief is done:
6290,III.,Thy soul walks now beside thy Beatrice;
6291,III.,Ravenna guards thine ashes: sleep in peace.
6292,III.,
6293,IV.,IV.
6294,IV.,
6295,IV.,How lone this palace is; how grey the walls!
6296,IV.,No minstrel now wakes echoes in these halls.
6297,IV.,"The broken chain lies rusting on the door,"
6298,IV.,And noisome weeds have split the marble floor:
6299,IV.,"Here lurks the snake, and here the lizards run"
6300,IV.,By the stone lions blinking in the sun.
6301,IV.,Byron dwelt here in love and revelry
6302,IV.,"For two long years—a second Anthony,"
6303,IV.,Who of the world another Actium made!
6304,IV.,"Yet suffered not his royal soul to fade,"
6305,IV.,"Or lyre to break, or lance to grow less keen,"
6306,IV.,’Neath any wiles of an Egyptian queen.
6307,IV.,"For from the East there came a mighty cry,"
6308,IV.,"And Greece stood up to fight for Liberty,"
6309,IV.,And called him from Ravenna: never knight
6310,IV.,Rode forth more nobly to wild scenes of fight!
6311,IV.,"None fell more bravely on ensanguined field,"
6312,IV.,Borne like a Spartan back upon his shield!
6313,IV.,"O Hellas!  Hellas! in thine hour of pride,"
6314,IV.,"Thy day of might, remember him who died"
6315,IV.,To wrest from off thy limbs the trammelling chain:
6316,IV.,O Salamis!  O lone Platæan plain!
6317,IV.,O tossing waves of wild Euboean sea!
6318,IV.,O wind-swept heights of lone Thermopylæ!
6319,IV.,"He loved you well—ay, not alone in word,"
6320,IV.,"Who freely gave to thee his lyre and sword,"
6321,IV.,Like Æschylos at well-fought Marathon:
6322,IV.,
6323,IV.,"And England, too, shall glory in her son,"
6324,IV.,"Her warrior-poet, first in song and fight."
6325,IV.,No longer now shall Slander’s venomed spite
6326,IV.,"Crawl like a snake across his perfect name,"
6327,IV.,Or mar the lordly scutcheon of his fame.
6328,IV.,
6329,IV.,"For as the olive-garland of the race,"
6330,IV.,"Which lights with joy each eager runner’s face,"
6331,IV.,"As the red cross which saveth men in war,"
6332,IV.,As a flame-bearded beacon seen from far
6333,IV.,"By mariners upon a storm-tossed sea,—"
6334,IV.,Such was his love for Greece and Liberty!
6335,IV.,
6336,IV.,"Byron, thy crowns are ever fresh and green:"
6337,IV.,Red leaves of rose from Sapphic Mitylene
6338,IV.,"Shall bind thy brows; the myrtle blooms for thee,"
6339,IV.,In hidden glades by lonely Castaly;
6340,IV.,"The laurels wait thy coming: all are thine,"
6341,IV.,And round thy head one perfect wreath will twine.
6342,IV.,
6343,V.,V.
6344,V.,
6345,V.,The pine-tops rocked before the evening breeze
6346,V.,"With the hoarse murmur of the wintry seas,"
6347,V.,And the tall stems were streaked with amber bright;—
6348,V.,"I wandered through the wood in wild delight,"
6349,V.,"Some startled bird, with fluttering wings and fleet,"
6350,V.,"Made snow of all the blossoms; at my feet,"
6351,V.,"Like silver crowns, the pale narcissi lay,"
6352,V.,And small birds sang on every twining spray.
6353,V.,"O waving trees, O forest liberty!"
6354,V.,"Within your haunts at least a man is free,"
6355,V.,And half forgets the weary world of strife:
6356,V.,"The blood flows hotter, and a sense of life"
6357,V.,"Wakes i’ the quickening veins, while once again"
6358,V.,The woods are filled with gods we fancied slain.
6359,V.,"Long time I watched, and surely hoped to see"
6360,V.,Some goat-foot Pan make merry minstrelsy
6361,V.,Amid the reeds! some startled Dryad-maid
6362,V.,"In girlish flight! or lurking in the glade,"
6363,V.,"The soft brown limbs, the wanton treacherous face"
6364,V.,"Of woodland god! Queen Dian in the chase,"
6365,V.,"White-limbed and terrible, with look of pride,"
6366,V.,And leash of boar-hounds leaping at her side!
6367,V.,Or Hylas mirrored in the perfect stream.
6368,V.,
6369,V.,O idle heart!  O fond Hellenic dream!
6370,V.,"Ere long, with melancholy rise and swell,"
6371,V.,"The evening chimes, the convent’s vesper bell,"
6372,V.,Struck on mine ears amid the amorous flowers.
6373,V.,Alas! alas! these sweet and honied hours
6374,V.,"Had whelmed my heart like some encroaching sea,"
6375,V.,And drowned all thoughts of black Gethsemane.
6376,V.,
6377,VI.,VI.
6378,VI.,
6379,VI.,O lone Ravenna! many a tale is told
6380,VI.,Of thy great glories in the days of old:
6381,VI.,Two thousand years have passed since thou didst see
6382,VI.,Cæsar ride forth to royal victory.
6383,VI.,Mighty thy name when Rome’s lean eagles flew
6384,VI.,From Britain’s isles to far Euphrates blue;
6385,VI.,"And of the peoples thou wast noble queen,"
6386,VI.,Till in thy streets the Goth and Hun were seen.
6387,VI.,"Discrowned by man, deserted by the sea,"
6388,VI.,"Thou sleepest, rocked in lonely misery!"
6389,VI.,"No longer now upon thy swelling tide,"
6390,VI.,"Pine-forest-like, thy myriad galleys ride!"
6391,VI.,"For where the brass-beaked ships were wont to float,"
6392,VI.,The weary shepherd pipes his mournful note;
6393,VI.,And the white sheep are free to come and go
6394,VI.,Where Adria’s purple waters used to flow.
6395,VI.,
6396,VI.,O fair!  O sad!  O Queen uncomforted!
6397,VI.,"In ruined loveliness thou liest dead,"
6398,VI.,Alone of all thy sisters; for at last
6399,VI.,Italia’s royal warrior hath passed
6400,VI.,"Rome’s lordliest entrance, and hath worn his crown"
6401,VI.,In the high temples of the Eternal Town!
6402,VI.,"The Palatine hath welcomed back her king,"
6403,VI.,And with his name the seven mountains ring!
6404,VI.,
6405,VI.,"And Naples hath outlived her dream of pain,"
6406,VI.,"And mocks her tyrant!  Venice lives again,"
6407,VI.,New risen from the waters! and the cry
6408,VI.,"Of Light and Truth, of Love and Liberty,"
6409,VI.,"Is heard in lordly Genoa, and where"
6410,VI.,"The marble spires of Milan wound the air,"
6411,VI.,"Rings from the Alps to the Sicilian shore,"
6412,VI.,And Dante’s dream is now a dream no more.
6413,VI.,
6414,VI.,"But thou, Ravenna, better loved than all,"
6415,VI.,Thy ruined palaces are but a pall
6416,VI.,That hides thy fallen greatness! and thy name
6417,VI.,Burns like a grey and flickering candle-flame
6418,VI.,Beneath the noonday splendour of the sun
6419,VI.,"Of new Italia! for the night is done,"
6420,VI.,"The night of dark oppression, and the day"
6421,VI.,Hath dawned in passionate splendour: far away
6422,VI.,"The Austrian hounds are hunted from the land,"
6423,VI.,Beyond those ice-crowned citadels which stand
6424,VI.,"Girdling the plain of royal Lombardy,"
6425,VI.,From the far West unto the Eastern sea.
6426,VI.,
6427,VI.,"I know, indeed, that sons of thine have died"
6428,VI.,"In Lissa’s waters, by the mountain-side"
6429,VI.,"Of Aspromonte, on Novara’s plain,—"
6430,VI.,Nor have thy children died for thee in vain:
6431,VI.,"And yet, methinks, thou hast not drunk this wine"
6432,VI.,"From grapes new-crushed of Liberty divine,"
6433,VI.,Thou hast not followed that immortal Star
6434,VI.,Which leads the people forth to deeds of war.
6435,VI.,"Weary of life, thou liest in silent sleep,"
6436,VI.,"As one who marks the lengthening shadows creep,"
6437,VI.,"Careless of all the hurrying hours that run,"
6438,VI.,"Mourning some day of glory, for the sun"
6439,VI.,"Of Freedom hath not shewn to thee his face,"
6440,VI.,And thou hast caught no flambeau in the race.
6441,VI.,
6442,VI.,"Yet wake not from thy slumbers,—rest thee well,"
6443,VI.,"Amidst thy fields of amber asphodel,"
6444,VI.,"Thy lily-sprinkled meadows,—rest thee there,"
6445,VI.,To mock all human greatness: who would dare
6446,VI.,To vent the paltry sorrows of his life
6447,VI.,"Before thy ruins, or to praise the strife"
6448,VI.,"Of kings’ ambition, and the barren pride"
6449,VI.,Of warring nations! wert not thou the Bride
6450,VI.,Of the wild Lord of Adria’s stormy sea!
6451,VI.,The Queen of double Empires! and to thee
6452,VI.,Were not the nations given as thy prey!
6453,VI.,"And now—thy gates lie open night and day,"
6454,VI.,"The grass grows green on every tower and hall,"
6455,VI.,The ghastly fig hath cleft thy bastioned wall;
6456,VI.,And where thy mailèd warriors stood at rest
6457,VI.,The midnight owl hath made her secret nest.
6458,VI.,"O fallen! fallen! from thy high estate,"
6459,VI.,"O city trammelled in the toils of Fate,"
6460,VI.,"Doth nought remain of all thy glorious days,"
6461,VI.,"But a dull shield, a crown of withered bays!"
6462,VI.,
6463,VI.,"Yet who beneath this night of wars and fears,"
6464,VI.,From tranquil tower can watch the coming years;
6465,VI.,"Who can foretell what joys the day shall bring,"
6466,VI.,Or why before the dawn the linnets sing?
6467,VI.,"Thou, even thou, mayst wake, as wakes the rose"
6468,VI.,To crimson splendour from its grave of snows;
6469,VI.,As the rich corn-fields rise to red and gold
6470,VI.,"From these brown lands, now stiff with Winter’s cold;"
6471,VI.,As from the storm-rack comes a perfect star!
6472,VI.,
6473,VI.,O much-loved city!  I have wandered far
6474,VI.,From the wave-circled islands of my home;
6475,VI.,Have seen the gloomy mystery of the Dome
6476,VI.,"Rise slowly from the drear Campagna’s way,"
6477,VI.,Clothed in the royal purple of the day:
6478,VI.,I from the city of the violet crown
6479,VI.,"Have watched the sun by Corinth’s hill go down,"
6480,VI.,And marked the ‘myriad laughter’ of the sea
6481,VI.,From starlit hills of flower-starred Arcady;
6482,VI.,"Yet back to thee returns my perfect love,"
6483,VI.,As to its forest-nest the evening dove.
6484,VI.,
6485,VI.,O poet’s city! one who scarce has seen
6486,VI.,Some twenty summers cast their doublets green
6487,VI.,"For Autumn’s livery, would seek in vain"
6488,VI.,"To wake his lyre to sing a louder strain,"
6489,VI.,Or tell thy days of glory;—poor indeed
6490,VI.,"Is the low murmur of the shepherd’s reed,"
6491,VI.,"Where the loud clarion’s blast should shake the sky,"
6492,VI.,And flame across the heavens! and to try
6493,VI.,Such lofty themes were folly: yet I know
6494,VI.,That never felt my heart a nobler glow
6495,VI.,Than when I woke the silence of thy street
6496,VI.,"With clamorous trampling of my horse’s feet,"
6497,VI.,"And saw the city which now I try to sing,"
6498,VI.,After long days of weary travelling.
6499,VI.,
6500,VII.,VII.
6501,VII.,
6502,VII.,"Adieu, Ravenna! but a year ago,"
6503,VII.,I stood and watched the crimson sunset glow
6504,VII.,From the lone chapel on thy marshy plain:
6505,VII.,The sky was as a shield that caught the stain
6506,VII.,"Of blood and battle from the dying sun,"
6507,VII.,And in the west the circling clouds had spun
6508,VII.,"A royal robe, which some great God might wear,"
6509,VII.,While into ocean-seas of purple air
6510,VII.,Sank the gold galley of the Lord of Light.
6511,VII.,
6512,VII.,Yet here the gentle stillness of the night
6513,VII.,"Brings back the swelling tide of memory,"
6514,VII.,And wakes again my passionate love for thee:
6515,VII.,"Now is the Spring of Love, yet soon will come"
6516,VII.,On meadow and tree the Summer’s lordly bloom;
6517,VII.,"And soon the grass with brighter flowers will blow,"
6518,VII.,And send up lilies for some boy to mow.
6519,VII.,"Then before long the Summer’s conqueror,"
6520,VII.,"Rich Autumn-time, the season’s usurer,"
6521,VII.,"Will lend his hoarded gold to all the trees,"
6522,VII.,And see it scattered by the spendthrift breeze;
6523,VII.,And after that the Winter cold and drear.
6524,VII.,So runs the perfect cycle of the year.
6525,VII.,"And so from youth to manhood do we go,"
6526,VII.,And fall to weary days and locks of snow.
6527,VII.,Love only knows no winter; never dies:
6528,VII.,Nor cares for frowning storms or leaden skies
6529,VII.,"And mine for thee shall never pass away,"
6530,VII.,Though my weak lips may falter in my lay.
6531,VII.,
6532,VII.,"Adieu!  Adieu! yon silent evening star,"
6533,VII.,"The night’s ambassador, doth gleam afar,"
6534,VII.,And bid the shepherd bring his flocks to fold.
6535,VII.,Perchance before our inland seas of gold
6536,VII.,"Are garnered by the reapers into sheaves,"
6537,VII.,"Perchance before I see the Autumn leaves,"
6538,VII.,I may behold thy city; and lay down
6539,VII.,Low at thy feet the poet’s laurel crown.
6540,VII.,
6541,VII.,"Adieu!  Adieu! yon silver lamp, the moon,"
6542,VII.,"Which turns our midnight into perfect noon,"
6543,VII.,"Doth surely light thy towers, guarding well"
6544,VII.,"Where Dante sleeps, where Byron loved to dwell."
