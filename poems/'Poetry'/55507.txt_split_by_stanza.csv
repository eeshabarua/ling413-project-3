92,TO ----,TO ---- 
93,TO ----,"If, Lady, at thy bidding, I have strung As on one thread these few unvalued beads, I cannot ask the world to count them pearls, Or to esteem them better than they are: But thou, I know, wilt prize them, for by thee Solicited, I have beguiled with these The enforcèd leisure of the present time, And dedicate of right my little book To thee, beloved--sure at least of this That if my verse has aught of good or true, It will not lack the answer of one heart-- And if herein it may be thou shalt find Some notes of jarring discord, some that speak A spirit ill at ease, unharmonised, Yet ’twere a wrong unto thyself to deem These are the utterance of my present heart, My present mood--but of long years ago, When neither in the light of thy calm eyes, Nor in the pure joys of an innocent home, Nor in the happy laughter of these babes, Had I as yet found comfort, peace, or joy. But all is changèd now, and could I weave A lay of power, it should not now be wrung From miserable moods of sullen sin, Chewing the bitter ashes of the fruit Itself had gathered; rather would I speak Of light from darkness, good from evil brought By an almighty power, and how all things, If we will not refuse the good they bring, Are messages of an almighty love, And full of blessings. Oh! be sure of this-- All things are mercies while we count them so; And this believing, not keen poverty Nor wasting years of pain or slow disease, Nor death, which in a moment might lay low Our pleasant plants,--not these, if they should come, Shall ever drift our bark of faith ashore, Whose stedfast anchor is securely cast Within the veil, the veil of things unseen, Which now we know not, but shall know hereafter. "
94,TO ----,"Yet wherefore this? for we have not been called To interpret the dark ways of Providence, But that unsleeping eye that wakes for us, Has kept from hurt, and harm, and blind mischance, Our happy home till now. Yet not for this Can we escape our share of human fears And dim forebodings, chiefly when we think Under what hostile influence malign They may grow up, for whom their life is cast Now to begin in this unhappy age, When all, that by a solemn majesty And an enduring being once rebuked And put to shame the sordid thoughts of man, Must be no more permitted to affront Him and his littleness, or bid him back Unto the higher tasks and nobler cares For which he lives, for which his life is lent. "
95,TO ----,"Yet what though all things must be common now, And nothing sacred, nothing set apart, But each enclosure by rude hands laid waste, That did fence in from the world’s wilderness Some spot of holy ground, wherein might grow The tender slips, the planting of the Lord; Within the precincts of which holy spots, With awful ordinances fencèd round, They might grow up in beauty and in peace, In season due to be transplanted thence Into the garden of God,--what though all these May perish, there will yet remain to us One citadel, one ark, which hands profane Will scarce invade, or lay unholy touch Upon the sanctities inviolate, And pure religion of our sacred homes. And here the culture may proceed, and here Heaven may distil its rich and silent dews, When all around is parched as desert heath. For this may come, the withering and the drought, The laying waste of every holy hedge May come, how soon we know not, but may fear; Since nations walk, no less than men, by faith, As seeing that which is invisible Unto the sealèd eye of sensual men: And where this vision is not, or the seers Are lightly counted of, the people perish. And woe unto our country, if indeed She has left off this wisdom, or esteems This for her higher wisdom--to despise All spiritual purpose, all far-looking aim, And all that cannot be exchanged for gold-- Woe unto her, and turbulent unrest Unto ourselves, who cannot hope or wish In her disquiet to lead quiet lives, Or to withdraw out of the stormy press And tumult--to withdraw and keep the latch Close fastened of our little world apart, A peaceful island in a stormy sea, A patch of sunshine amid shadows lying; This must not be, we were not called to this. And all the peace we know must be within, And from within--from that glad river fed, Whose springs lie deeper than that heat or cold, Or the vicissitudes earth’s surface knows Can reach to harm them. "
96,TO ----,"Mayest thou know well What are these springing waters, wells of life, By the great Father dug for us at first, And which, when sin had stopped them, love anew Has opened, and has given them their old names And former virtue[1]; and from these refreshed, Mayest thou pass onward through the wilderness, And knowing what of ill is imminent, And may descend upon us, evermore Strengthen with faith and prayer, with lofty thought And effort, and it may be in some part With soul-sustaining verse, the citadel Of courage and heroic fortitude, Which in the centre of a woman’s heart Is stablished, whatsoever outwardly Of doubt or womanly weak fear prevail.

99,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.) 
100,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),"It seems to me like yesterday, The morning when I took my way Upon the shore--in solitude; For in that miserable mood It was relief to quit the ken And the inquiring looks of men-- The looks of love and gentleness, And pity, that would fain express Its only purpose was to know, That, knowing, it might soothe my woe: But when I felt that I was free From searching gaze, it was to me Like ending of a dreary task, Or putting off a cumbrous mask. "
101,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),"I wandered forth upon the shore, Wishing this lie of life was o’er; What was beyond I could not guess, I thought it might be quietness, And now I had no dream of bliss, No thought, no other hope but this-- To be at rest--for all that fed The dream of my proud youth had fled, My dream of youth, that I would be Happy and glorious, wise and free, In mine own right, and keep my state, And would repel the heavy weight, The load that crushed unto the ground The servile multitude around; The purpose of my life had failed, The heavenly heights I would have scaled, Seemed more than ever out of sight, Further beyond my feeble flight. The beauty of the universe Was lying on me like a curse; Only the lone surge at my feet Uttered a soothing murmur sweet, As every broken weary wave Sunk gently to a quiet grave, Dying on the bosom of the sea-- And death grew beautiful to me, Until it seemed a mother mild, And I like some too happy child; A happy child, that tired with play, Through a long summer holiday, Runs to his mother’s arms to weep His little weariness asleep. Rest--rest--all passion that once stirred My heart, had ended in one word-- My one desire to be at rest, To lay my head on any breast, Where there was hope that I might keep A dreamless and unbroken sleep; And the lulled ocean seemed to say, “With me is quiet,--come away.” There is a tale that oft has stirred My bosom deeply: you have heard How that the treacherous sea-maid’s art With song inveigles the lost heart Of some lone fisher, that has stood For days beside the glimmering flood; And when has grown upon him there The mystery of earth and air, He cannot find with whom to part The burden lying at his heart; So when the mermaid bids him come, And summons to her peaceful home, He hears--he leaps into the wave, To find a home, and not a grave. "
102,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),"Anon I said I would not die; I loathed to live--I feared to die-- So I went forward, till I stood Amid a marble solitude, A ruined town of ancient day. I rested where some steps away From other work of human hand Two solitary pillars stand, Two pillars on a wild hill side, Like sea-marks of a shrunken tide: Their shafts were by the sea-breeze worn, Beneath them waved the verdant corn; But a few paces from the crown Of that green summit, farther down, A fallen pillar on the plain, Slow sinking in the earth again, Bedding itself in dark black mould, Lay moveless, where it first had rolled. It once had been a pillar high, And pointing to the starry sky; But now lay prostrate, its own weight Now serving but to fix its state, To sink it in its earthy bed; I gazed, and to myself I said, “This pillar lying on the plain The hand of man might raise again, And set it as in former days; But the fall’n spirit who shall raise, What power on earth? what power in heaven?” How quickly was an answer given Unto this voice of my despair! But now I sat in silence there, I thought upon the vanished time, And my irrevocable prime, My baffled purpose, wasted years, My sin, my misery--and my tears Fell thick and fast upon the sands; I hid my face within my hands, For tears are strange that find their way Under the open eye of day, Under the broad and glorious sun, Full in the heavens, as mine have done, And as upon that day they did, Unnoticed, unrestrained, unchid. How long I might have felt them flow Without a check, I do not know, But presently, while yet I kept That attitude of woe, and wept, A mild voice sounded in mine ears-- “You cannot wash your heart with tears!” I quickly turned--and, vexed to be Seen in my spirit’s agony, In anger had almost replied-- An aged man was at my side; I think that since my life began, I never saw an older man, Than he who stood beside me then, And with mild accents said again: “You cannot cleanse your heart with tears, Though you should weep as many years As our great Father, when he sat Uncomforted on Ararat-- This would not help you, and the tear Which does not heal, will scald and sear. What is your sorrow?” "
103,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),"Until now I never had unveiled my woe-- Not that I shunned sweet sympathies, Man’s words, or woman’s pitying eyes; But that I felt they were in vain, And could not help me--for the pain, The wound which I was doomed to feel, Man gave not, and he could not heal. But in this old man’s speech and tone Was something that allured me on: I told him all--I did not hide My sin, my sorrow, or my pride: I told him how, when I began First to verge upward to a man, These thoughts were mine--to dwell alone, My spirit on its lordly throne, Hating the vain stir, fierce and loud, The din of the tumultuous crowd; And how I thought to arm my soul, And stablish it in self-controul; And said I would obey the right, And would be strong in wisdom’s might, And bow unto mine own heart’s law, And keep my heart from speck or flaw, That in its mirror I might find A reflex of the Eternal mind, A glass to give me back the truth-- And how before me from my youth A phantom ever on the wing, Appearing now, now vanishing, Had flitted, looking out from shrine, From painting, or from work divine Of poet’s, or of sculptor’s art; And how I feared it might depart, That beauty which alone could shed Light on my life--and then I said, I would beneath its shadow dwell, And would all lovely things compel, All that was beautiful or fair In art or nature, earth or air, To be as ministers to me, To keep me pure, to keep me free From worldly service, from the chain Of custom, and from earthly stain; And how they kept me for a while, And did my foolish heart beguile; Yet all at last did faithless prove, And, late or soon, betrayed my love; How they had failed me one by one, Till now, when youth was scarcely done, My heart, which I had thought to steep In hues of beauty, and to keep Its consecrated home and fane, That heart was soiled with many a stain, Which from without and from within Had gathered there, till all was sin, Till now I only drew my breath, I lived but in the hope of death. "
104,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),"While my last words were giving place To my heart’s anguish, o’er his face A shadow of displeasure past, But vanished then again as fast As the breeze-shadow from the brook; And with mild words and pitying look He gently said-- “Ah me, my son, A weary course your life has run; And yet it need not be in vain, That you have suffered all this pain; And, if mine years might make me bold To speak, methinks I could unfold Why in such efforts you could meet But only misery and defeat. Yet deem not of us as at strife, Because you set before your life A purpose and a loftier aim, Than the blind lives of men may claim For the most part--or that you sought, By fixed resolve and solemn thought, To lift your being’s calm estate Out of the range of time and fate. Glad am I that a thing unseen, A spiritual Presence, this has been Your worship, this your young heart stirred-- But yet herein you proudly erred, Here may the source of woe be found, You thought to fling, yourself around, The atmosphere of light and love In which it was your joy to move-- You thought by efforts of your own To take at last each jarring tone Out of your life, till all should meet In one majestic music sweet-- Deeming that in our own heart’s ground The root of good was to be found, And that by careful watering And earnest tendance we might bring The bud, the blossom, and the fruit To grow and flourish from that root-- You deemed we needed nothing more Than skill and courage to explore Deep down enough in our own heart, To where the well-head lay apart, Which must the springs of being feed, And that these fountains did but need The soil that choked them moved away, To bubble in the open day. But, thanks to heaven, it is not so, That root a richer soil doth know Than our poor hearts could e’er supply, That stream is from a source more high, From God it came, to God returns, Not nourished from our scanty urns, But fed from his unfailing river, Which runs and will run on for ever.” When now he came to heavenly things And spake of them, his spirit had wings, His words seemed not his own, but given-- I could have deemed one spake from heaven Of hope and joy, of life and death, And immortality through faith, Of that great change commenced within, The blood that cleanses from all sin, That can wash out the inward stain, And consecrate the heart again, The voice that clearer and more clear Doth speak unto the purgèd ear, The gracious influences given In a continued stream from heaven, The balm that can the soul’s hurt heal, The Spirit’s witness and its seal. "
105,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),"I listened, for unto mine ear The Word, which I had longed to hear, Was come at last, the lifeful word Which I had often almost heard In some deep silence of my breast-- For with a sense of dim unrest That word unborn had often wrought, And struggled in the womb of thought, As from beneath the smothering earth The seed strives upward to a birth: And lo! it now was born indeed-- Here was the answer to my need. "
106,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),"But now we parted, never more To meet upon that lone sea-shore. We have not met on earth again, And scarcely shall--there doth remain A time, a place where we shall meet, And have the stars beneath our feet. Since then I many times have sought Who this might be, and sometimes thought It must have been an angel sent To be a special instrument And minister of grace to me, Or deemed again it might be He, Of whom some say he shall not die, Till he have seen with mortal eye The glory of his Lord again: But this is a weak thought and vain. "
107,(SEE JUSTIN MARTYR’S FIRST DIALOGUE WITH TRYPHO.),"We parted, each upon our way-- I homeward, where my glad course lay Beside those ruins where I sate On the same morning--desolate,-- With scarcely strength enough to grieve: And now it was a marvellous eve, The waters at my feet were bright, And breaking into isles of light: The misty sunset did enfold A thousand floating motes of gold; The red light seemed to penetrate Through the worn stone, and re-create The old, to glorify anew; And steeping all things through and through A rich dissolving splendour poured Through rent and fissure, and restored The fall’n, the falling and decayed, Filling the rifts which time had made, Till the rent masses seemed to meet, The pillar stand upon its feet, And tower and cornice, roof and stair Hung self-upheld in the magic air. Transfigured thus those temples stood Upon the margin of the flood, All glorious as they rose of yore, There standing, as not ever more They could be harmed by touch of time, But still, as in that perfect prime, Must flourish unremoved and free, Or as they then appeared to me, A newer and more glorious birth, A city of that other earth, That Earth which is to be.

And looking forth on meadow, stream, and sky, And on the golden west, that richest glow Of sunset to the uncreated light, Which must invest for ever those bright worlds, Seemed darkness, and the best that earth can give, Its noblest pleasures, they with one consent Counted as vile, nor once to be compared-- Oh! rather say not worthy to be named With what is to be looked for there; and thus Leaving behind them all things which are seen, By many a stately stair they did ascend Above the earth and all created things, The sun and starry heavens--yea, and above The mind of man, until they did attain Where light no shadow has, and life no death, Where past or future are not, nor can be, But an eternal present, and the Lamb His people feeds from indeficient streams. Then pausing for a moment, as to taste That river of delights, at length they cried, Oh! to be thus for ever, and to hear Thus in the silence of the lower world, And in the silence of all thoughts that keep Vain stir within, unutterable words, And with the splendour of His majesty, Whose seat is in the middle of the throne, Thus to be fed for ever--this must be The beatific vision, the third heaven. What we have for these passing moments known, To know the same for ever--this would be That life whereof even now we held debate. When will it be? oh when? "
206,AN EVENING IN FRANCE.,"These things they said, And for a season breathed immortal air, But then perforce returned to earth again: For the air on those first summits is too fine For our long breathing, while we yet have on Our gross investiture of mortal weeds. "
207,AN EVENING IN FRANCE.,"Yet not for nothing had their spirits flown To those high regions, bringing back at once A reconcilement with the mean things here, And a more earnest longing for what there Of nobler was by partial glimpses thus Seen through the crannies of the prison house. And she, that mother--such entire content Possessed her bosom, and her Lord had filled The orb of her desires so round and full, Had answered all her prayers for her lost son With such an overmeasure of his grace, She had no more to ask, and did not know Why she should tarry any longer here, Nor what she did on earth. Thus then she felt, And to these thoughts which overflowed her heart Gave thankful utterance meet; nor many days After this vision and foretaste of joy, Inherited the substance of the things Which she had seen, and entered into peace.

There were no need to fear thy worser mood, Striving in years to come against the good He would impart, if thou couldst keep in mind How many times, the while with anxious care He sought to screen thee from the chilling air, Upon his bosom thou hast slept reclined.

212,THE DESCENT OF THE RHONE.,"Often when my thought has been Pondering on what solemn scene, Which of all the glorious shows Nature can at will disclose, Once beholden by the eye, Ever after would supply Most unto the musing heart Of memories which should not depart-- It has seemed no ampler dower Of her beauty or her power We could win, than night and day, An illimitable way, To sail down some mighty river, Sailing as we would sail for ever. "
213,THE DESCENT OF THE RHONE.,"Lo! my wish is almost won, Broadly flows the stately Rhone, And we loosen from the shore Our light pinnace, long before The young East in gorgeous state Has unlocked his ruby gate, And our voyage is not done At the sinking of the sun; But for us the azure Night Feeds her golden flocks with light: Ours are all the hues of heaven, Sights and sounds of morn and even; In our view the day is born; First the stars of lustre shorn, Until Hesper, he who last Kept his splendour, now fades fast; A faint bloom over heaven is spread, And the clouds blush deeper red, Till from them the stream below Catches the same roseate glow; The pale east lightens into gold, And the west is with the fold Of the mantle of dim night Scarcely darkened or less bright-- Till, his way prepared, at length Rising up in golden strength, Tramples the victorious sun The dying stars out, one by one. "
214,THE DESCENT OF THE RHONE.,"Fairer scene the opening eye Of the day can scarce descry-- Fairer sight he looks not on Than the pleasant banks of Rhone; Where in terraces and ranks, On those undulating banks, Rise by many a hilly stair Sloping tiers of vines, where’er From the steep and stony soil Has been won by careful toil, And with long laborious pains Fenced against the washing rains, Fenced and anxiously walled round, A little patch of garden ground. Higher still some place of power, Or a solitary tower, Ruined now, is looking down On some quiet little town In a sheltered glen beneath, Where the smoke’s unbroken wreath, Mounting in the windless air, Rests, dissolving slowly there, O’er the housetops like a cloud, Or a thinnest vapourous shroud. "
215,THE DESCENT OF THE RHONE.,"Morn has been, and lo! how soon Has arrived the middle noon, And the broad sun’s rays do rest On some naked mountain’s breast, Where alone relieve the eye Massive shadows, as they lie In the hollows motionless; Still our boat doth onward press. Now a peaceful current wide Bears it on an ample tide, Now the hills retire, and then Their broad fronts advance again, Till the rocks have closed us round, And would seem our course to bound, But anon a way appears, And our vessel onward steers, Darting swiftly as between Narrow walls of a ravine. "
216,THE DESCENT OF THE RHONE.,"Morn has been and noon--and now Evening falls about our prow: But the sunken sunset still Burns behind the western hill; Lo! the starry troop again Gather on the ethereal plain; Even now and there were none, And a moment since but one; And anon we lift our head, And all heaven is overspread With a still assembling crowd, With a silent multitude-- Venus, first and brightest set In the night’s pale coronet, Armed Orion’s belted pride, And the Seven that by the side Of the Titan nightly weave Dances in the mystic eve, Sisters linked in love and light; ’Twere in truth a solemn sight, Were we sailing now as they, Who upon their western way To the isles of spice and gold, Nightly watching, might behold These our constellations dip, And the great sign of the Ship Rise upon the other hand, With the Cross that seems to stand In the vault of heaven upright, Marking the middle hour of night-- Or with them whose keels first prest The mighty rivers of the west, Who the first with bold intent Down the Orellana went,[6] Or a dangerous progress won On the mighty Amazon, By whose ocean-streams they tell How yet the warrior-maidens dwell. "
217,THE DESCENT OF THE RHONE.,"But the Fancy may not roam; Thou wilt keep it nearer home, Friend, of earthly friends the best, Who on this fair river’s breast Sailest with me fleet and fast, As the unremitting blast With a steady breath and strong Urges our light boat along. We this day have found delight In each pleasant sound and sight Of this river bright and fair, And in things which flowing are Like a stream, yet without blame These my passing song may claim, Or thy hearing may beguile, If we not forget the while, That we are from childhood’s morn On a mightier river borne, Which is rolling evermore To a sea without a shore, Life the river, and the sea That we seek--eternity. We may sometimes sport and play, And in thought keep holiday, So we ever own a law, Living in habitual awe, And beneath the constant stress Of a solemn thoughtfulness, Weighing whither this life tends, For what high and holy ends It was lent us, whence it flows, And its current whither goes. "
218,THE DESCENT OF THE RHONE.,"There is ample matter here For as much of thought and fear, As will solemnize our souls-- Thought of how this river rolls Over millions wrecked before They could reach that happy shore, Where we have not anchored yet; Of the dangers which beset Our own way, of hidden shoal, Waters smoothest where they roll Over point of sunken rock, Treacherous calm, and sudden shock Of the storm, which can assail No boat than ours more weak or frail-- Matter not alone of sadness, But no less of thankful gladness, That, whichever way we turn, There are steady lights that burn On the shore, and lamps of love In the gloomiest sky above, Which will guide our bark aright Through the darkness of our night-- Many a fixed unblinking star Unto them that wandering are Through this blindly-weltering sea. Themes of high and thoughtful glee, When we think we are not left, Of all solaces bereft, Each to hold, companionless, Through a watery wilderness, Unaccompanied our way, As we can--this I may say, Whatsoever else betide, With thee sitting at my side, And this happy cherub sweet, Playing, laughing at my feet.

And Thou--is thine the spirit’s swift recoil, Which follows every deed of acted wrath, That holding in thine hand this lovely spoil, Thou dost not triumph, feeling that the breath Of life is sacred, whether it inform, Loathly or beauteous, man or beast or worm?

This calm has nothing strange, yet not the less This holy evening’s solemn quietness, The perfect beauty of this windless lake, This stillness which no harsher murmurs break Than the frogs croaking from the distant sedge, These vineyards drest unto the water’s edge, This hind that homeward driving the slow steer, Tells that man’s daily work goes forward here, Have each a power upon me, while I drink The influence of the placid time, and think How gladly that sweet Mother once again Resumes her sceptre and benignant reign, But for a few short instants scared away By the mad game, the cruel impious fray Of her distempered children--how comes back, And leads them in the customary track Of blessing once again; to order brings Anew the dislocated frame of things, And covers up, and out of sight conceals What they have wrought of ill, or gently heals.

Oh! and her mood of anger did not last More than an instant, but her work of peace, Restoring and repairing, comforting The earth, her stricken child, will never cease; For that was her strange work, and quickly past, To this her genial toil no end the years shall bring.

236,SINGING IN A CONVENT CHURCH AT ROME.,"Sweet voices! seldom mortal ear Strains of such potency might hear; My soul, that listened, seemed quite gone, Dissolved in sweetness, and anon I was borne upward, till I trod Among the hierarchy of God. And when they ceased, as time must bring An end to every sweetest thing, With what reluctancy came back My spirits to their wonted track, And how I loathed the common life, The daily and recurring strife With petty sins, the lowly road And being’s ordinary load. Why after such a solemn mood Should any meaner thought intrude? Why will not heaven hereafter give, That we for evermore may live Thus at our spirit’s topmost bent? This said I in my discontent. "
237,SINGING IN A CONVENT CHURCH AT ROME.,"But give me, Lord, a wiser heart; These seasons come, and they depart, These seasons, and those higher still, When we are given to have our fill Of strength and life and joy with thee, And brightness of thy face to see. They come, or we could never guess Of heaven’s sublimer blessedness; They come, to be our strength and cheer In other times, in doubt or fear, Or should our solitary way Lie through the desert many a day. They go, they leave us blank and dead, That we may learn, when they are fled, We are but vapours which have won A moment’s brightness from the sun, And which it may at pleasure fill With splendour, or unclothe at will. Well for us they do not abide, Or we should lose ourselves in pride, And be as angels--but as they Who on the battlements of day Walked, gazing on their power and might, Till they grew giddy in their height.

But welcome too the common way, The lowly duties of the day, And all which makes and keeps us low, Which teaches us ourselves to know, That we, who do our lineage high Draw from beyond the starry sky, Are yet upon the other side To earth and to its dust allied.

Two that were strangers to that sunny land, And to each other, met upon this strand; One seemed to keep so slight a hold of life, That when he willed, without the spirit’s strife, He might let go--a flower upon a ledge Of verdant meadow by a river’s edge, Which ever loosens with its treacherous flow In gradual lapse the moistened soil below; While to the last in beauty and in bloom That flower is scattering incense o’er its tomb, And with the dews upon it, and the breath Of the fresh morning round it, sinks to death.

So blest he seemed, the other could not choose To wake him, but went down the narrow stair; And when he met an aged attendant there, She ceased her work to tell him, when he said, Her patient then on happy slumber fed, But that anon he would return once more,-- Her inmate had expired an hour before.

That meditation could not prove to me But as a spring that ever bubbles up, Sparkling in the face of heaven, when every day Reminded me how little gladness then I gathered from these things, but now how much. "

But some lonely spot, Some ridge of ruin fringed with cypresses, Such as have everywhere loved well to make Their chosen home above all other trees, ’Mid the fal’n palaces of ancient Rome, Me did such haunt please better, or I loved, With others whom the like disquietude, At the like crisis of their lives, now kept Restless, with them to question to and fro And to debate the evil of the world, As tho’ we bore no portion of that ill, As tho’ with subtle phrases we could spin A woof to screen us from its undelight: Such talk sometimes prolonging into night, As being loth to separate, and find Each in his solitude how vain are words, When that they have opposed to them is more.

But so it was with me, a sojourner, Five years ago, beneath these mouldering walls As I am now: and, trusted friend, to thee I have not doubted to reveal my soul, For thou hast known, if I may read aright The pages of thy past existence, thou Hast known the dreary sickness of the soul, That falls upon us in our lonely youth, The fear of all bright visions leaving us, The sense of emptiness, without the sense Of an abiding fulness anywhere, When all the generations of mankind, With all their purposes, their hopes and fears, Seem nothing truer than those wandering shapes Cast by a trick of light upon a wall, And nothing different from these, except In their capacity for suffering; What time we have the sense of sin, and none Of expiation. Our own life seemed then But as an arrow flying in the dark Without an aim, a most unwelcome gift, Which we might not put by. But now, what God Intended as a blessing and a boon We have received as such, and we can say A solemn yet a joyful thing is life, Which, being full of duties, is for this Of gladness full, and full of lofty hopes.

We wander thro’ the busy street, And think how every one we meet Has parents sister friend or wife, With whom to share the load of life. We wander on, for little care Have we turn our footsteps there, Where we are but a nameless guest, One who may claim no interest In any heart--a passing face, That comes and goes, and leaves no trace; Where service waits us, prompt but cold, A loveless service, bought and sold. "
268,LINES WRITTEN IN AN INN.,"Yet hard it is not to sustain A time like this, if there remain True greetings for us, hand and heart, Wherein we claim the chiefest part, Although divided now they be By many a tract of land and sea.

Full of refreshment these occasions are, Like seasonable resting-places given To pilgrim feet; for tho’, alas! too rare, Yet the sweet memories they supply, will give The food on which affection’s heart may live In after times; since it were sad indeed If all more intimate knowledge did not breed More trust in one another and more love, More faith that each is seeking to attain With humble earnest effort, not in vain, The happy rest of God. And so they part On their divided ways with cheerful heart, Knowing that in all places they will call On the same God and Father over all; And part not wholly, since they meet whose prayer Meets at the throne of grace; one life divine Through all the branches of the mystical vine Flows ever, even as the same breath of air Lifts every leaflet of a mighty grove. And from our meeting we shall reap a share Of a yet higher good, if we have won Hereby the strengthening of one weak desire, The fanning of one faint spark to a fire, The stirring of one prayer, that we may prove Stedfast and faithful till our work be done, Until the course appointed us be run.

O beloved friend, It is a cheering thought, if I should be Where I can no more watch for him nor tend His infant years--there where I cannot see What good, what evil wait upon his way, That yet thy love thy counsel and thy cares He will not lack, a child of faithful prayers.

And I too am upborne with thee together In circles ever narrowing, round and round, Over the clouds and sunshine--who erewhile, Like a blest bird of charmèd summer-weather In the blue shadow of some foamless isle, Was floating on the billows of sweet sound.

It is the noblest gift beneath the moon, The power, this awful presence to compel Out of the lurking places where it lies Deep-hidden and removed from human eyes: Oh! reverence thou in fear and cherish well This privilege of few, this rarest boon.

If we might keep this awe upon us still, If we might walk for ever in the power And in the shadow of the mystery, Which has been spread around us at this hour, This might suffice to guard us from much ill, This might go far to keep us pure and free.

In these high raptures there is nothing sure, Nothing that we can rest on, to sustain The spirit long, or arm it to endure Against temptation weariness or pain, And if they promise to preserve it pure From earthly taint, the promise is in vain.

But who indeed shall his high flights sustain, Who soar aloft and sink not? He alone Who has laid hold upon that golden chain Of love, fast linked to God’s eternal throne,-- The golden chain from heav’n to earth let down, That we might rise by it, nor fear to sink again. "

I know not any, unenthralled of sorrow, I know not one, to whom this joyous morrow, So full of living motion new and bright, Will be a summons to secure delight. And thus I shall not harm thee, though I claim Awhile thy presence--O mysterious Sleep.

How pleasant were it there in dim recess, In some close-curtained haunt of quietness, To hear no tones of human pain and care, Our own or others, little heeding there, If morn or noon or night Pursued their weary flight, But musing what an easy thing it were To mix our opiates in a larger cup, And drink, and not perceive Sleep deepening lead his truer kinsman up, Like undistinguished Night, darkening the skirts of Eve.

Win truth, win goodness--for which man was made, And fear not thou of these to be bereft, Fear not that these shall in the dust be laid, Or in corruption left, Or be the grave-worm’s food. Nothing is left or lost--nothing of good, Or lovely; but whatever its first springs Has drawn from God, returns to him again; That only which ’twere misery to retain Is taken from you, which to keep were loss; Only the scum the refuse and the dross Are borne away unto the grave of things, Meanwhile whatever gifts from heav’n descend Thither again have flowed, To the receptacle of all things good, From whom they come and unto whom they tend, Who is the First and Last, the Author and the End.

407,ON THE DAY OF HIS BAPTISM.,"The rainbow colours mix and blend Each with the other, until none Can tell where fainter hues had end, And deeper tints begun. "
408,ON THE DAY OF HIS BAPTISM.,But only doth this much appear-- That the pale hues are deeper grown; The day has broken bright and clear; The bud is fully blown. 
409,ON THE DAY OF HIS BAPTISM.,"Dear child, and happy shalt thou be, If from this hour, with just increase All good things shall grow up in thee, By such unmarked degrees. "
410,ON THE DAY OF HIS BAPTISM.,"If there shall be no dreary space Between thy present self and past, No dreary miserable place With spectral shapes aghast; "
411,ON THE DAY OF HIS BAPTISM.,"But the full graces of thy prime Shall, in their weak beginnings, be Lost in an unremembered time Of holy infancy. "
412,ON THE DAY OF HIS BAPTISM.,"This blessing is the first and best; Yet has not prayer been made in vain For them, tho’ not so amply blest, The lost and found again. "
413,ON THE DAY OF HIS BAPTISM.,"And shouldest thou, alas! forbear To choose the better, nobler lot, Yet may we not esteem our prayer Unheard or heeded not; "
414,ON THE DAY OF HIS BAPTISM.,"If after many a wandering, And many a devious pathway trod; If having known that bitter thing, To leave the Lord thy God, "
415,ON THE DAY OF HIS BAPTISM.,"It yet shall be, that thou at last, Altho’ thy noon be lost, return To bind life’s eve in union fast To this, its blessed morn. "
416,THE MONK AND BIRD.,THE MONK AND BIRD. 
417,I.,I. 
418,I.,"As he who finds one flower sharp thorns among, Plucks it, and highly prizes, though before Careless regard on thousands he has flung, As fair as this or more; "
419,II.,II. 
420,II.,"Not otherwise perhaps this argument Won from me, where I found it, such regard, That I esteemed no labour thereon spent As wearisome or hard. "
421,III.,III. 
422,III.,"In huge and antique volume did it lie, That by two solemn clasps was duly bound, As neither to be opened or laid by But with due thought profound. "
423,IV.,IV. 
424,IV.,"There fixèd thought to questions did I lend, Which hover on the bounds of mortal ken, And have perplexed, and will unto the end Perplex the brains of men; "
425,V.,V. 
426,V.,"Of what is time, and what eternity, Of all that seems and is not--forms of things-- Till my tired spirit followed painfully On flagging weary wings. "
427,VI.,VI. 
428,VI.,"So that I welcomed this one resting-place, Pleased as a bird, that when its forces fail, Lights panting in the ocean’s middle space Upon a sunny sail. "
429,VII.,VII. 
430,VII.,"And now the grace of fiction, which has power To render things impossible believed, And win them with the credence of an hour To be for truths received-- "
431,VIII.,VIII. 
432,VIII.,"That grace must help me, as it only can, Winning such transient credence, while I tell What to a cloistered solitary man In ancient times befel. "
433,IX.,IX. 
434,IX.,"Him little might our earthly grandeur feed, Who to the uttermost was vowed to be A follower of his Master’s barest need, In holy poverty. "
435,X.,X. 
436,X.,"Nor might he know the gentle mutual strife Of home affections, which can more or less Temper with sweet the bitter of our life, And lighten its distress. "
437,XI.,XI. 
438,XI.,"Yet we should err to deem that he was left To bear alone our being’s lonely weight, Or that his soul was vacant and bereft Of pomp and inward state: "
439,XII.,XII. 
440,XII.,"Morn, when before the sun his orb unshrouds, Swift as a beacon torch the light has sped, Kindling the dusky summits of the clouds Each to a fiery red-- "
441,XIII.,XIII. 
442,XIII.,"The slanted columns of the noonday light, Let down into the bosom of the hills, Or sunset, that with golden vapour bright The purple mountains fills-- "
443,XIV.,XIV. 
444,XIV.,"These made him say,--if God has so arrayed A fading world that quickly passes by, Such rich provision of delight was made For every human eye, "
445,XV.,XV. 
446,XV.,"What shall the eyes that wait for him survey, Where his own presence gloriously appears In worlds that were not founded for a day, But for eternal years? "
447,XVI.,XVI. 
448,XVI.,"And if at seasons this world’s undelight Oppressed him, or the hollow at its heart, One glance at those enduring mansions bright Made gloomier thoughts depart; "
449,XVII.,XVII. 
450,XVII.,"Till many times the sweetness of the thought Of an eternal country--where it lies Removed from care and mortal anguish, brought Sweet tears into his eyes. "
451,XVIII.,XVIII. 
452,XVIII.,"Thus, not unsolaced, he longwhile abode, Filling all dreary melancholy time, And empty spaces of the heart with God, And with this hope sublime: "
453,XIX.,XIX. 
454,XIX.,"Even thus he lived, with little joy or pain, Drawn thro’ the channels by which men receive-- Most men receive the things which for the main Make them rejoice or grieve. "
455,XX.,XX. 
456,XX.,"But for delight--on spiritual gladness fed, And obvious to temptations of like kind; One such, from out his very gladness bred, It was his lot to find. "
457,XXI.,XXI. 
458,XXI.,"When first it came, he lightly put it by, But it returned again to him ere long, And ever having got some new ally, And every time more strong-- "
459,XXII.,XXII. 
460,XXII.,"A little worm that gnawed the life away Of a tall plant, the canker of its root, Or like as when, from some small speck, decay Spreads o’er a beauteous fruit. "
461,XXIII.,XXIII. 
462,XXIII.,"For still the doubt came back--can God provide For the large heart of man what shall not pall, Nor thro’ eternal ages’ endless tide On tired spirits fall. "
463,XXIV.,XXIV. 
464,XXIV.,"Here but one look tow’rd heavèn will repress The crushing weight of undelightful care; But what were there beyond, if weariness Should ever enter there? "
465,XXV.,XXV. 
466,XXV.,"Yet do not sweetest things here soonest cloy? Satiety the life of joy would kill, If sweet with bitter, pleasure with annoy Were not attempered still. "
467,XXVI.,XXVI. 
468,XXVI.,"This mood endured, till every act of love, Vigils of praise and prayer, and midnight choir, All shadows of the service done above, And which, while his desire, "
469,XXVII.,XXVII. 
470,XXVII.,"And while his hope was heav’nward, he had loved, As helps to disengage him from the chain That fastens unto earth--all these now proved Most burdensome and vain. "
471,XXVIII.,XXVIII. 
472,XXVIII.,"What must have been the issue of that mood It were a thing to fear--but that one day, Upon the limits of an ancient wood, His thoughts him led astray. "
473,XXIX.,XXIX. 
474,XXIX.,"Darkling he went, nor once applied his ear, On a loud sea of agitations thrown, Nature’s low tones and harmonies to hear, Heard by the calm alone. "
475,XXX.,XXX. 
476,XXX.,"The merry chirrup of the grasshopper, Sporting among the roots of withered grass, The dry leaf rustling to the wind’s light stir Did each unnoted pass: "
477,XXXI.,XXXI. 
478,XXXI.,"He, walking in a trance of selfish care, Not once observed the beauty shed around, The blue above, the music in the air, The flowers upon the ground; "
479,XXXII.,XXXII. 
480,XXXII.,"Till from the centre of that forest dim Came to him such sweet singing of a bird, As sweet in very truth, then seemed to him The sweetest ever heard. "
481,XXXIII.,XXXIII. 
482,XXXIII.,"That lodestar drew him onward inward still, Deeper than where the village children stray, Deeper than where the woodman’s glittering bill Lops the large boughs away-- "
483,XXXIV.,XXXIV. 
484,XXXIV.,"Into a central space of glimmering shade, Where hardly might the struggling sunbeams pass, Which a faint lattice-work of light had made Upon the long lank grass. "
485,XXXV.,XXXV. 
486,XXXV.,"He did not sit, but stood and listened there, And to him listening the time seemed not long, While that sweet bird above him filled the air With its melodious song. "
487,XXXVI.,XXXVI. 
488,XXXVI.,"He heard not, saw not, felt not aught beside, Through the wide worlds of pleasure and of pain, Save the full flowing and the ample tide Of that celestial strain. "
489,XXXVII.,XXXVII. 
490,XXXVII.,"As tho’ a bird of Paradise should light A moment on a twig of this bleak earth, And singing songs of Paradise invite All hearts to holy mirth, "
491,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII. 
492,XXXVIII.,"And then take wing to Paradise again, Leaving all listening spirits raised above The toil of earth the trouble and the pain, And melted all in love: "
493,XXXIX.,XXXIX. 
494,XXXIX.,"Such spiritual might, such power was in the sound, But when it ceased sweet music to unlock, The spell that held him sense and spirit-bound Dissolved with a slight shock. "
495,XL.,XL. 
496,XL.,"All things around were as they were before-- The trees and the blue sky, and sunshine bright, Painting the pale and leafstrewn forest-floor With patches of faint light. "
497,XLI.,XLI. 
498,XLI.,"But as when music doth no longer thrill, Light shudderings yet along the chords will run, Or the heart vibrates tremulously still, After its prayer be done, "
499,XLII.,XLII. 
500,XLII.,"So his heart fluttered all the way he went, Listening each moment for the vesper bell; For a long hour he deemed he must have spent In that untrodden dell. "
501,XLIII.,XLIII. 
502,XLIII.,"And once it seemed that something new or strange Had passed upon the flowers the trees the ground, Some slight but unintelligible change On every thing around: "
503,XLIV.,XLIV. 
504,XLIV.,"Such change, where all things undisturbed remain, As only to the eye of him appears, Who absent long, at length returns again-- The silent work of years. "
505,XLV.,XLV. 
506,XLV.,"And ever grew upon him more and more Fresh marvel--for, unrecognised of all, He stood a stranger at the convent door-- New faces filled the hall. "
507,XLVI.,XLVI. 
508,XLVI.,"Yet was it long ere he received the whole Of that strange wonder--how, while he had stood Lost in deep gladness of his inmost soul, Far hidden in that wood, "
509,XLVII.,XLVII. 
510,XLVII.,A generation had gone down unseen Under the thin partition which is spread-- The thin partition of thin earth--between The living and the dead. 
511,XLVIII.,XLVIII. 
512,XLVIII.,"Nor did he many days to earth belong, For like a pent-up stream, released again, The years arrested by the strength of song, Came down on him amain; "
513,XLIX.,XLIX. 
514,XLIX.,"Sudden as a dissolving thaw in spring; Gentle as when upon the first warm day, Which sunny April in its train may bring, The snow melts all away. "
515,L.,L. 
516,L.,"They placed him in his former cell, and there Watched him departing; what few words he said Were of calm peace and gladness, with one care Mingled--one only dread-- "
517,LI.,LI. 
518,LI.,Lest an eternity should not suffice To take the measure and the breadth and height Of what there is reserved in Paradise-- Its ever-new delight.
