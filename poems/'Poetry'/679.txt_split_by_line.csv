93,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,MY MOTHER'S KISS.
94,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,
95,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,"My mother's kiss, my mother's kiss,"
96,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,I feel its impress now;
97,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,As in the bright and happy days
98,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,She pressed it on my brow.
99,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,
100,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,You say it is a fancied thing
101,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,Within my memory fraught;
102,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,To me it has a sacred place--
103,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,The treasure house of thought.
104,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,
105,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,"Again, I feel her fingers glide"
106,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,Amid my clustering hair;
107,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,"I see the love-light in her eyes,"
108,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,When all my life was fair.
109,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,
110,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,"Again, I hear her gentle voice"
111,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,In warning or in love.
112,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,How precious was the faith that taught
113,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,My soul of things above.
114,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,
115,MY MOTHER'S KISS.,(1)

119,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,
120,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,"The music of her voice is stilled,"
121,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,Her lips are paled in death.
122,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,As precious pearls I'll clasp her words
123,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,Until my latest breath.
124,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,
125,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,The world has scattered round my path
126,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,Honor and wealth and fame;
127,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,But naught so precious as the thoughts
128,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,That gather round her name.
129,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,
130,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,And friends have placed upon my brow
131,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,The laurels of renown;
132,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,But she first taught me how to wear
133,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,My manhood as a crown.
134,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,
135,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,"My hair is silvered o'er with age,"
136,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,I'm longing to depart;
137,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,"To clasp again my mother's hand,"
138,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,And be a child at heart.
139,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,
140,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,To roam with her the glory-land
141,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,Where saints and angels greet;
142,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,To cast our crowns with songs of love
143,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,At our Redeemer's feet.
144,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,
145,2 MY MOTHER'S KISS.,

148,A GRAIN OF SAND.,A GRAIN OF SAND.
149,A GRAIN OF SAND.,
150,A GRAIN OF SAND.,Do you see this grain of sand
151,A GRAIN OF SAND.,Lying loosely in my hand?
152,A GRAIN OF SAND.,Do you know to me it brought
153,A GRAIN OF SAND.,Just a simple loving thought?
154,A GRAIN OF SAND.,When one gazes night by night
155,A GRAIN OF SAND.,"On the glorious stars of light,"
156,A GRAIN OF SAND.,Oh how little seems the span
157,A GRAIN OF SAND.,Measured round the life of man.
158,A GRAIN OF SAND.,
159,A GRAIN OF SAND.,Oh! how fleeting are his years
160,A GRAIN OF SAND.,With their smiles and their tears;
161,A GRAIN OF SAND.,Can it be that God does care
162,A GRAIN OF SAND.,For such atoms as we are?
163,A GRAIN OF SAND.,Then outspake this grain of sand
164,A GRAIN OF SAND.,"""I was fashioned by His hand"
165,A GRAIN OF SAND.,In the star lit realms of space
166,A GRAIN OF SAND.,I was made to have a place.
167,A GRAIN OF SAND.,
168,A GRAIN OF SAND.,"""Should the ocean flood the world,"
169,A GRAIN OF SAND.,Were its mountains 'gainst me hurled
170,A GRAIN OF SAND.,All the force they could employ
171,A GRAIN OF SAND.,Wouldn't a single grain destroy;
172,A GRAIN OF SAND.,"And if I, a thing so light,"
173,A GRAIN OF SAND.,Have a place within His sight;
174,A GRAIN OF SAND.,You are linked unto his throne
175,A GRAIN OF SAND.,Cannot live nor die alone.

196,THE CROCUSES.,To see them all again.
197,THE CROCUSES.,
198,THE CROCUSES.,While the snow-drops still were sleeping
199,THE CROCUSES.,Beneath the silent sod;
200,THE CROCUSES.,They felt their new life pulsing
201,THE CROCUSES.,"Within the dark, cold clod."
202,THE CROCUSES.,
203,THE CROCUSES.,Not a daffodil nor daisy
204,THE CROCUSES.,Had dared to raise its head;
205,THE CROCUSES.,Not a fairhaired dandelion
206,THE CROCUSES.,Peeped timid from its bed;
207,THE CROCUSES.,
208,THE CROCUSES.,
209,THE CROCUSES.  5,THE CROCUSES.  5
210,THE CROCUSES.  5,
211,THE CROCUSES.  5,Though a tremor of the winter
212,THE CROCUSES.  5,Did shivering through them run;

214,THE CROCUSES.  5,To greet the vernal sun.
215,THE CROCUSES.  5,
216,THE CROCUSES.  5,And the sunbeams gave them welcome.
217,THE CROCUSES.  5,As did the morning air
218,THE CROCUSES.  5,And scattered o'er their simple robes
219,THE CROCUSES.  5,Rich tints of beauty rare.
220,THE CROCUSES.  5,
221,THE CROCUSES.  5,Soon a host of lovely flowers
222,THE CROCUSES.  5,From vales and woodland burst;
223,THE CROCUSES.  5,But in all that fair procession
224,THE CROCUSES.  5,The crocuses were first.
225,THE CROCUSES.  5,
226,THE CROCUSES.  5,First to weave for Earth a chaplet
227,THE CROCUSES.  5,To crown her dear old head;
228,THE CROCUSES.  5,And to beautify the pathway
229,THE CROCUSES.  5,Where winter still did tread.
230,THE CROCUSES.  5,
231,THE CROCUSES.  5,And their loved and white haired mother
232,THE CROCUSES.  5,"Smiled sweetly 'neath the touch,"
233,THE CROCUSES.  5,When she knew her faithful children
234,THE CROCUSES.  5,Were loving her so much.
