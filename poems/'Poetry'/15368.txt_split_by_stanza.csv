14,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"_Fugitive Pieces_, Byron's first volume of verse, was privately printed in the autumn of 1806, when Byron was eighteen years of age. Passages in Byron's correspondence indicate that as early as August of that year some of the poems were in the printers' hands and that during the latter part of August and during September the printing was suspended in order that Byron might give his poems an ""entire new form."" The new form consisted, in part, in an enlargement; for he wrote to Elizabeth Pigot about September that he had nearly doubled his poems ""partly by the discovery of some I conceived to be lost, and partly by some new productions."" According to Moore, _Fugitive Pieces_ was ready for distribution in November. The last poem in the volume bears the date of November 16, 1806. "
15,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"A difficulty in supposing the date of completion of the volume to be about November 16 is that two copies contain inscriptions in Byron's hand with earlier dates. On the copy of the late Mr. J.A. Spoor, of Chicago, the inscription reads: ""October 21st Tuesday 1806--Haec poemata ex dono sunt--Georgii Gordon Byron, Vale."" That on the copy in the Morgan library reads: ""Nov. 8, 1806, H.P.E.D.S.G.G.B., Southwell.--Vale!--Byron,"" the initials evidently standing for the Latin words of the preceding inscription. The Latin ""Vale"" in each inscription, however, suggests that it commemorates a leave-taking, the date referring not to the presentation but to the farewell. "
16,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"It has been suggested that copies of the volume were distributed earlier than November and that some of the poems, printed separately and distributed in fly-leaf form, were added later. This would explain such discrepancies as the early dates of the inscriptions, and the presence of Byron's name on pages 46 and 48 in a volume otherwise anonymous, but there is little evidence to support it. "
17,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Moore's account of _Fugitive Pieces_ is that it was distributed in November, Byron presenting the first copy to the Reverend J.T. Becher, prebendary of Southwell minster, who objected to what he considered the too voluptuous coloring of the poem ""To Mary."" The objection led Byron to suppress the edition immediately, he himself burning nearly every copy. This account is corroborated in part by Miss Pigot and in part by Byron. "
18,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Immediately after the destruction, Byron began the preparation of a second volume, to replace _Fugitive Pieces_. This appeared in January, 1807, as _Poems on Various Occasions_, Byron describing it as ""vastly correct and miraculously chaste."" Of the 38 poems that constitute _Fugitive Pieces_, all except ""To Mary,"" ""To Caroline,"" and the last six stanzas of ""To Miss E.P."" were reprinted in _Poems on Various Occasions_. Nineteen of the original 38 poems occur in Byron's third work, _Hours of Idleness_, published in June or July, 1807. All three editions were printed by S. and J. Ridge, booksellers of Newark, England. "
19,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Byron himself never reprinted the poems ""To Mary"" or ""To Caroline,"" or the last six stanzas of ""To Miss E.P."" Except in a limited facsimile of _Fugitive Pieces_, supervised by H. Buxton Forman in 1886, ""To Mary"" has never been reprinted--not even in supposedly complete editions of Byron's works. "
20,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Only four copies of _Fugitive Pieces_ are known to-day, and one of these is incomplete. The copy from which the present facsimile is made was originally given by Byron to Becher and preserved by him in spite of his objections to the poem ""To Mary."" From Becher's family it passed into the possession of Mr. Faulkner, of Louth, solicitor for the Becher family. In 1885 it was in the possession of H.W. Ball, antiquary and bookseller of Barton-on-Humber, who sold it to H. Buxton Forman. Forman used it for his facsimile, but incorporated certain manuscript corrections of the original, so that his facsimile is not exact. The original is now owned by Mr. Thomas J. Wise, who has kindly permitted its use for the present facsimile. "
21,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Of the other three copies, the incomplete one, lacking pages 17-20 (""To Mary"") and all after page 58, is in the possession of the family of the late Mr. H.C. Roe, of Nottingham. This was originally sent by Byron to Pigot, then studying medicine in Edinburgh. Byron later asked Pigot to destroy the copy and Pigot seems to have complied so far as to tear out the offending verses ""To Mary."" For many years it was thought that only the Pigot and Becher copies had escaped destruction at Byron's hands. But another complete copy came to light in 1907 and is now in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. This contains numerous manuscript corrections and alterations, and seems to have been used as a proof copy for _Poems on Various Occasions_ (not, as has sometimes been stated, for _Hours of Idleness_). A fourth copy, also complete, was offered at public sale in 1912, and is now in the hands of the executors of the late Mr. J.A. Spoor, of Chicago. "
22,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"The present facsimile is an exact photographic reproduction of the text with all typographical and other errors as in the original, except that certain manuscript corrections which appear in the original perforce appear in the photographic reproduction, as follows: "
23,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Page 3, _To E_.... line 2.           ""me"" has been inserted by hand. "
24,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Page 8, stanza 5, line 2.            A letter (""s""?) has been erased between ""so"" and ""oft,"" and the second ""e"" of ""meets"" has been inserted to replace ""l."" "
25,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Page 14, line 10.                    ""j"" in ""jargon"" has been inserted by hand. "
26,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Page 19, stanza (11), line 1.        ""night"" was originally printed ""might,"" the ""m"" later changed to ""n"" by erasure. "
27,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Page 24, stanza 4, line 4.           ""s"" in ""setting"" has been inserted by hand. "
28,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Page 25, _Thoughts Suggested by_     ""e"" in ""tremble"" has been _a College Examination_,    inserted, correcting ""trimble."" line 4. "
29,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Page 31, line 4.                     ""f"" in ""fast"" was originally ""l,"" but was changed by hand. "
30,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"The text has been collated with that in the Morgan library, and except for later corrections made in ink in the Morgan copy, the only differences noted are as follows: "
31,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"1.) On p. 5, in the first line of the footnote, the Morgan copy reads ""piece"" where the Wise copy reads ""p*ece,"" the ""[dotless i]"" lacking. "
32,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"2.) The two pages of signature M are incorrectly numbered in the Wise copy as ""41, 41,"" this copy having no page numbered 42; and are incorrectly numbered in the Morgan copy as ""40, 42,"" the latter copy having no page numbered 41. The text of these pages is identical. "

57,ON LEAVING N--ST--D.,"Though a tear dims his eye at this sad separation, 'Tis nature, not fear, which commands his regret; Far distant he goes with the same emulation, In the grave, he alone can his fathers forget. "
58,ON LEAVING N--ST--D.,"Your fame, and your memory, still will he cherish, He vows that he ne'er will disgrace your renown; Like you will he live, or like you will he perish, When decay'd, may he mingle his dust with your own. "

Could tears have turn'd the tyrant in his course, Could sighs have check'd his dart's relentless force; Could youth and virtue claim a short delay, Or beauty charm the spectre from his prey. Thou still had'st liv'd, to bless my aching sight, Thy comrade's honour, and thy friend's delight: Though low thy lot, since in a cottage born, No titles did thy humble name adorn, To me, far dearer, was thy artless love, Than all the joys, wealth, fame, and friends could prove. For thee alone I liv'd, or wish'd to live, (Oh God! if impious, this rash word forgive) Heart broken now, I wait an equal doom, Content to join thee in thy turf-clad tomb; Where this frail form compos'd in endless rest, I'll make my last, cold, pillow on thy breast; That breast where oft in life, I've laid my head, Will yet receive me mouldering with the dead; This life resign'd without one parting sigh, Together in one bed of earth we'll lie! Together share the fate to mortals given, Together mix our dust, and hope for Heaven. "

Whilst all around sit wrapt in speechless gloom, _His_ voice in thunder shakes the sounding dome; Denouncing dire reproach, to luckless fools, Unskill'd to plod in mathematic rules. "
252,THOUGHTS SUGGESTED BY A COLLEGE EXAMINATION.,"Happy the youth! in Euclid's axioms tried, Though little vers'd in any art beside; Who with scarce sense to pen an _English_ letter, Yet with precision, scans an _attic metre_. "

Can tell what edicts sage _Lycurgus_ made, Whilst _Blackstone's_ on the _shelf neglected_ laid; Of _Grecian dramas_ vaunts the deathless fame, Of _Avon's bard_, remembering scarce the name. "
254,THOUGHTS SUGGESTED BY A COLLEGE EXAMINATION.,"Such is the youth, whose scientific pate, Class honours, medals, fellowships await; Or even perhaps the _declamation_ prize, If to such glorious height, he lifts his eyes. But lo! no _common_ orator can hope The envied silver cup within his scope; Not that our _heads_ much eloquence require, The ATHENIAN's glowing style, or TULLY's fire. The _manner_ of the speech is nothing, since We do not try by _speaking_ to _convince_; Be other _orators_ of pleasing _proud_, We speak to _please_ ourselves, not _move_ the crowd. Our gravity prefers the _muttering_ tone, A proper mixture of the _squeak and groan_; No borrow'd _grace_ of _action_, must be seen, The slightest motion would displease the _dean_. Whilst every staring graduate would prate, Against what, _he_ could never imitate. "
255,THOUGHTS SUGGESTED BY A COLLEGE EXAMINATION.,"The man, who hopes t' obtain the promis'd cup, Must in one _posture_ stand, and _ne'er look up_, Nor _stop_, but rattle over _every_ word, No matter _what_, so it can _not_ be heard; Thus let him hurry on, nor think to rest, Who speaks the _fastest_, 's sure to speak the _best_; Who utters most within the shortest space, May safely hope to win the _wordy race_. "

Dull as the pictures, which adorn their halls, They think all learning fix'd within their walls: In manners rude, in foolish forms precise, All modern arts, affecting to despise. Yet prizing _Bentley's[6] Brunck's[6]_ or _Porson's_[7] note, More than the _verse, on which the critic wrote_; With eager haste, they court the tool of power, (Whether 'tis PITT or PETTY rules the hour:) To _him_, with suppliant smiles they bend the head, Whilst mitres, prebends, to their eyes are spread. But should a storm o'erwhelm him with disgrace, They'd fly to seek the next, who fill'd his place; _Such_ are the men who learning's treasures guard, _Such_ is their _practice_, such is their _reward_; This _much_ at least we may presume to say, Th' _reward's_ scarce equal, to the _price_ they _pay_.

When PITT expired in plenitude of power, Though ill success obscur'd his dying hour, Pity her dewy wings before him spread, For noble spirits ""war not with the dead;"" His friends in tears, a last sad requiem gave, And all his errors slumber'd in the grave. He died an Atlas, bending 'neath the weight, Of cares oppressing our unhappy state; But lo! another Hercules appear'd, Who for a time, the ruined fabric rear'd; He too is dead! who still our England propp'd, With him our fast reviving hopes have dropp'd; Not one great people only raise his urn, All Europe's far extended regions mourn.

283,"OWN, AND APPOINTED A NIGHT IN DECEMBER, TO MEET HIM IN THE GARDEN.","These locks which fondly thus entwine, In firmer chains our hearts confine; Than all th' unmeaning protestations, Which swell with nonsense, love orations. Our love is fix'd, I think we've prov'd it, Nor time, nor place, nor art, have mov'd it; Then wherefore should we sigh, and whine, With groundless jealousy repine. With silly whims, and fancies frantic, Merely to make our love romantic. Why should you weep like _Lydia Languish_, And fret with self-created anguish. Or doom the lover you have chosen, On winter nights, to sigh half frozen: In leafless shades, to sue for pardon, Only because the scene's a garden. For gardens seem by one consent (Since SHAKESPEARE set the precedent;) (Since Juliet first declar'd her passion) To form the place of assignation. Oh! would some modern muse inspire, And seat her by a _sea-coal_ fire, Or had the bard at Christmas written, And laid the scene of love in Britain; He surely in commiseration, Had chang'd the place of declaration. In Italy I've no objection, Warm nights are proper for reflection; But here, our climate is so rigid, That love itself, is rather frigid; Think on our chilly situation, And curb this rage for imitation. Then let us meet, as oft we've done, Beneath the influence of the sun; Or, if at midnight I must meet you, Oh! let me in your chamber greet you; _There_ we can love for hours together, Much better in such snowy weather, Than plac'd in all th' Arcadian groves, That ever witness'd rural loves; _There_ if my passion fail to please, Next night I'll be content to freeze; No more I'll give a loose to laughter, But curse my fate, forever after.

But not for _her_ alone, we wish respect, _Others_ appear more conscious of defect; To night, no _Veteran Roscii_ you behold, In all the arts of scenic action old; No COOKE, no KEMBLE, can salute you here, No SIDDONS draw the sympathetic tear, To night, you thong to witness the debut, Of embryo actors to the drama new; Here then, our almost unfledg'd wings we try, Clip not our _pinions_, ere the _birds can fly_; Failing in this our first attempt to soar, Drooping, alas, we fall to rise no more. Not one poor trembler only, fear betrays, Who hopes, yet almost dreads to meet your praise; But all our Dramatis Personæ wait, In fond suspense, this crisis of their fate; No venal views our progress can retard, Your generous plaudits are our sole reward; For them each _Hero_ all his power displays, Each timid _Heroine_ shrinks before your gaze: Surely these last will some protection find, None to the softer sex can prove unkind; Whilst youth and beauty form the female shield, The sternest critic to the fair must yield. But should our feeble efforts nought avail, Should, _after all_, our best endeavours fail; Still let some mercy in your bosoms live, And if you can't applaud, at least _forgive_. "

TO ANNA.,"Oh! might I kiss those eyes of fire, A million scarce would quench desire, Still would I steep my lips in bliss, And dwell an age on every kiss; Nor then my soul should sated be, Still would I kiss, and cling to thee, Nought should my kiss from thine dissever. Still would we kiss, and kiss forever; E'en though the number did exceed, The yellow harvest's countless seed, To part would be a vain endeavour, Could I desist?--ah! never--never. "
