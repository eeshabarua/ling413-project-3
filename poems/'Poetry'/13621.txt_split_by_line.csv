367,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And, what no lawyer ever lack'd,"
368,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],With impudence own'd all the fact;
369,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But, what the gentlest heart would vex,"
370,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Laid all the fault on t'other sex.
371,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],That modern love is no such thing
372,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],As what those ancient poets sing:
373,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A fire celestial, chaste, refined,"
374,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Conceived and kindled in the mind;
375,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Which, having found an equal flame,"
376,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Unites, and both become the same,"
377,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"In different breasts together burn,"
378,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Together both to ashes turn.
379,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But women now feel no such fire,"
380,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And only know the gross desire.
381,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Their passions move in lower spheres,"
382,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Where'er caprice or folly steers,"
383,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A dog, a parrot, or an ape,"
384,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Or some worse brute in human shape,"
385,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Engross the fancies of the fair,"
386,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The few soft moments they can spare,"
387,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"From visits to receive and pay,"
388,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"From scandal, politics, and play;"
389,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"From fans, and flounces, and brocades,"
390,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"From equipage and park parades,"
391,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"From all the thousand female toys,"
392,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],From every trifle that employs
393,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The out or inside of their heads,"
394,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Between their toilets and their beds.
395,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"In a dull stream, which moving slow,"
396,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],You hardly see the current flow;
397,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"If a small breeze obstruct the course,"
398,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"It whirls about, for want of force,"
399,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And in its narrow circle gathers
400,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Nothing but chaff, and straws, and feathers."
401,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The current of a female mind
402,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Stops thus, and turns with every wind:"
403,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Thus whirling round together draws
404,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Fools, fops, and rakes, for chaff and straws."
405,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Hence we conclude, no women's hearts"
406,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Are won by virtue, wit, and parts:"
407,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Nor are the men of sense to blame,"
408,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],For breasts incapable of flame;
409,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The faults must on the nymphs be placed
410,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Grown so corrupted in their taste.
411,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The pleader having spoke his best,"
412,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Had witness ready to attest,"
413,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Who fairly could on oath depose,"
414,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"When questions on the fact arose,"
415,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],That every article was true;
416,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Nor further those deponents knew:
417,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Therefore he humbly would insist,"
418,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The bill might be with costs dismiss'd.
419,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The cause appear'd of so much weight,"
420,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"That Venus, from her judgment seat,"
421,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Desired them not to talk so loud,"
422,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Else she must interpose a cloud:
423,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],For if the heavenly folks should know
424,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"These pleadings in the courts below,"
425,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"That mortals here disdain to love,"
426,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She ne'er could show her face above;
427,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"For gods, their betters, are too wise"
428,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To value that which men despise.
429,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And then, said she, my son and I"
430,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Must stroll in air, 'twixt land and sky;"
431,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Or else, shut out from heaven and earth,"
432,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Fly to the sea, my place of birth:"
433,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"There live with daggled mermaids pent,"
434,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And keep on fish perpetual Lent.
435,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But since the case appear'd so nice,"
436,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She thought it best to take advice.
437,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The Muses, by the king's permission,"
438,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Though foes to love, attend the session,"
439,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And on the right hand took their places
440,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"In order; on the left, the Graces:"
441,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To whom she might her doubts propose
442,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],On all emergencies that rose.
443,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The Muses oft were seen to frown;
444,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The Graces half ashamed look'd down;
445,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And 'twas observed, there were but few"
446,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Of either sex among the crew,"
447,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Whom she or her assessors knew.
448,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The goddess soon began to see,"
449,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Things were not ripe for a decree;
450,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And said, she must consult her books,"
451,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The lovers' Fletas, Bractons, Cokes."
452,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],First to a dapper clerk she beckon'd
453,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"To turn to Ovid, book the second:"
454,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She then referr'd them to a place
455,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"In Virgil, _vide_ Dido's case:"
456,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"As for Tibullus's reports,"
457,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],They never pass'd for law in courts:
458,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"For Cowley's briefs, and pleas of Waller,"
459,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Still their authority was smaller.
460,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],There was on both sides much to say:
461,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She'd hear the cause another day;
462,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And so she did; and then a third;
463,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She heard it--there she kept her word:
464,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But, with rejoinders or replies,"
465,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Long bills, and answers stuff'd with lies,"
466,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Demur, imparlance, and essoign,"
467,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The parties ne'er could issue join:
468,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"For sixteen years the cause was spun,"
469,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And then stood where it first begun.
470,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Now, gentle Clio, sing, or say"
471,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],What Venus meant by this delay?
472,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The goddess much perplex'd in mind
473,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"To see her empire thus declined,"
474,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"When first this grand debate arose,"
475,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Above her wisdom to compose,"
476,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Conceived a project in her head
477,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"To work her ends; which, if it sped,"
478,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Would show the merits of the cause
479,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Far better than consulting laws.
480,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],In a glad hour Lucina's aid
481,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Produced on earth a wondrous maid,"
482,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],On whom the Queen of Love was bent
483,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To try a new experiment.
484,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She threw her law-books on the shelf,"
485,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And thus debated with herself.
486,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Since men allege, they ne'er can find"
487,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Those beauties in a female mind,"
488,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Which raise a flame that will endure
489,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],For ever uncorrupt and pure;
490,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"If 'tis with reason they complain,"
491,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],This infant shall restore my reign.
492,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"I'll search where every virtue dwells,"
493,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],From courts inclusive down to cells:
494,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"What preachers talk, or sages write;"
495,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"These will I gather and unite,"
496,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And represent them to mankind
497,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Collected in that infant's mind.
498,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"This said, she plucks in Heaven's high bowers"
499,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],A sprig of amaranthine flowers.
500,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"In nectar thrice infuses bays,"
501,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Three times refined in Titan's rays;
502,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Then calls the Graces to her aid,"
503,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And sprinkles thrice the newborn maid:
504,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],From whence the tender skin assumes
505,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],A sweetness above all perfumes:
506,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"From whence a cleanliness remains,"
507,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Incapable of outward stains:
508,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"From whence that decency of mind,"
509,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"So lovely in the female kind,"
510,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Where not one careless thought intrudes;
511,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Less modest than the speech of prudes;
512,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Where never blush was call'd in aid,"
513,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"That spurious virtue in a maid,"
514,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],A virtue but at second-hand;
515,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],They blush because they understand.
516,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The Graces next would act their part,"
517,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And show'd but little of their art;
518,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Their work was half already done,"
519,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The child with native beauty shone;
520,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The outward form no help required:
521,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Each, breathing on her thrice, inspired"
522,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"That gentle, soft, engaging air,"
523,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Which in old times adorn'd the fair:
524,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And said, ""Vanessa be the name"
525,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],By which thou shall be known to fame:
526,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Vanessa, by the gods enroll'd:"
527,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Her name on earth shall not be told."""
528,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],But still the work was not complete;
529,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],When Venus thought on a deceit.
530,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Drawn by her doves, away she flies,"
531,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And finds out Pallas in the skies.
532,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Dear Pallas, I have been this morn"
533,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To see a lovely infant born:
534,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A boy in yonder isle below,"
535,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"So like my own without his bow,"
536,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"By beauty could your heart be won,"
537,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],You'd swear it is Apollo's son;
538,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But it shall ne'er be said, a child"
539,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"So hopeful, has by me been spoil'd:"
540,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"I have enough besides to spare,"
541,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And give him wholly to your care.
542,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Wisdom's above suspecting wiles;
543,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The Queen of Learning gravely smiles,"
544,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Down from Olympus comes with joy,"
545,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Mistakes Vanessa for a boy;
546,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Then sows within her tender mind
547,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Seeds long unknown to womankind:
548,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"For manly bosoms chiefly fit,"
549,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The seeds of knowledge, judgment, wit."
550,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Her soul was suddenly endued
551,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"With justice, truth, and fortitude;"
552,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"With honour, which no breath can stain,"
553,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Which malice must attack in vain;
554,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],With open heart and bounteous hand.
555,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],But Pallas here was at a stand;
556,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She knew, in our degenerate days,"
557,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Bare virtue could not live on praise;
558,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],That meat must be with money bought:
559,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She therefore, upon second thought,"
560,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Infused, yet as it were by stealth,"
561,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Some small regard for state and wealth;
562,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Of which, as she grew up, there staid"
563,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],A tincture in the prudent maid:
564,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She managed her estate with care,"
565,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Yet liked three footmen to her chair.
566,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But, lest he should neglect his studies"
567,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Like a young heir, the thrifty goddess"
568,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],(For fear young master should be spoil'd)
569,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Would use him like a younger child;
570,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And, after long computing, found"
571,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],'Twould come to just five thousand pound.
572,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The Queen of Love was pleased, and proud,"
573,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To see Vanessa thus endow'd:
574,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She doubted not but such a dame
575,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Through every breast would dart a flame,"
576,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],That every rich and lordly swain
577,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],With pride would drag about her chain;
578,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"That scholars would forsake their books,"
579,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To study bright Vanessa's looks;
580,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"As she advanced, that womankind"
581,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Would by her model form their mind,"
582,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And all their conduct would be tried
583,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"By her, as an unerring guide;"
584,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Offending daughters oft would hear
585,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Vanessa's praise rung in their ear:
586,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Miss Betty, when she does a fault,"
587,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Lets fall her knife, or spills the salt,"
588,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Will thus be by her mother chid,"
589,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"""'Tis what Vanessa never did!"""
590,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Thus by the nymphs and swains adored,"
591,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"My power shall be again restored,"
592,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And happy lovers bless my reign--
593,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"So Venus hoped, but hoped in vain."
594,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],For when in time the Martial Maid
595,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Found out the trick that Venus play'd,"
596,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She shakes her helm, she knits her brows,"
597,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And, fired with indignation, vows,"
598,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"To-morrow, ere the setting sun,"
599,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She'd all undo that she had done.
600,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],But in the poets we may find
601,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A wholesome law, time out of mind,"
602,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Had been confirm'd by Fate's decree,"
603,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"That gods, of whatsoe'er degree,"
604,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Resume not what themselves have given,"
605,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Or any brother god in Heaven:
606,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Which keeps the peace among the gods,"
607,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Or they must always be at odds:
608,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And Pallas, if she broke the laws,"
609,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Must yield her foe the stronger cause;
610,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],A shame to one so much adored
611,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],For wisdom at Jove's council-board.
612,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Besides, she fear'd the Queen of Love"
613,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Would meet with better friends above.
614,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And though she must with grief reflect,"
615,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To see a mortal virgin deck'd
616,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],With graces hitherto unknown
617,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"To female breasts, except her own:"
618,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Yet she would act as best became
619,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],A goddess of unspotted fame.
620,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She knew, by augury divine,"
621,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Venus would fail in her design:
622,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She studied well the point, and found"
623,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Her foe's conclusions were not sound,"
624,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"From premises erroneous brought,"
625,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And therefore the deduction's naught,"
626,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And must have contrary effects,"
627,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To what her treacherous foe expects.
628,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],In proper season Pallas meets
629,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The Queen of Love, whom thus she greets,"
630,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"(For gods, we are by Homer told,"
631,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Can in celestial language scold:)--
632,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Perfidious goddess! but in vain
633,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],You form'd this project in your brain;
634,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A project for your talents fit,"
635,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],With much deceit and little wit.
636,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Thou hast, as thou shall quickly see,"
637,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Deceived thyself, instead of me;"
638,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],For how can heavenly wisdom prove
639,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],An instrument to earthly love?
640,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Know'st thou not yet, that men commence"
641,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Thy votaries for want of sense?
642,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Nor shall Vanessa be the theme
643,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To manage thy abortive scheme:
644,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She'll prove the greatest of thy foes;
645,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And yet I scorn to interpose,"
646,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But, using neither skill nor force,"
647,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Leave all things to their natural course.
648,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The goddess thus pronounced her doom:
649,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"When, lo! Vanessa in her bloom"
650,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Advanced, like Atalanta's star,"
651,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But rarely seen, and seen from far:"
652,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"In a new world with caution slept,"
653,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Watch'd all the company she kept,"
654,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Well knowing, from the books she read,"
655,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],What dangerous paths young virgins tread:
656,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Would seldom at the Park appear,"
657,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Nor saw the play-house twice a year;
658,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Yet, not incurious, was inclined"
659,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To know the converse of mankind.
660,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"First issued from perfumers' shops,"
661,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],A crowd of fashionable fops:
662,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],They ask'd her how she liked the play;
663,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Then told the tattle of the day;
664,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A duel fought last night at two,"
665,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],About a lady--you know who;
666,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Mention'd a new Italian, come"
667,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Either from Muscovy or Rome;
668,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Gave hints of who and who's together;
669,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Then fell to talking of the weather;
670,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Last night was so extremely fine,"
671,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The ladies walk'd till after nine:
672,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Then, in soft voice and speech absurd,"
673,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"With nonsense every second word,"
674,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"With fustian from exploded plays,"
675,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],They celebrate her beauty's praise;
676,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Run o'er their cant of stupid lies,"
677,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And tell the murders of her eyes.
678,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"With silent scorn Vanessa sat,"
679,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Scarce listening to their idle chat;
680,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Farther than sometimes by a frown,"
681,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"When they grew pert, to pull them down."
682,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],At last she spitefully was bent
683,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To try their wisdom's full extent;
684,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And said, she valued nothing less"
685,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Than titles, figure, shape, and dress;"
686,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],That merit should be chiefly placed
687,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"In judgment, knowledge, wit, and taste;"
688,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And these, she offer'd to dispute,"
689,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Alone distinguish'd man from brute:
690,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],That present times have no pretence
691,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"To virtue, in the noble sense"
692,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"By Greeks and Romans understood,"
693,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To perish for our country's good.
694,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She named the ancient heroes round,"
695,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Explain'd for what they were renown'd;
696,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Then spoke with censure or applause
697,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Of foreign customs, rites, and laws;"
698,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Through nature and through art she ranged
699,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And gracefully her subject changed;
700,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],In vain! her hearers had no share
701,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"In all she spoke, except to stare."
702,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Their judgment was, upon the whole,"
703,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],--That lady is the dullest soul!--
704,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Then tapt their forehead in a jeer,"
705,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],As who should say--She wants it here!
706,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She may be handsome, young, and rich,"
707,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],But none will burn her for a witch!
708,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A party next of glittering dames,"
709,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"From round the purlieus of St. James,"
710,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Came early, out of pure good will,"
711,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To see the girl in dishabille.
712,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Their clamour, 'lighting from their chairs"
713,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Grew louder all the way up stairs;
714,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"At entrance loudest, where they found"
715,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The room with volumes litter'd round.
716,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Vanessa held Montaigne, and read,"
717,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],While Mrs. Susan comb'd her head.
718,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"They call'd for tea and chocolate,"
719,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And fell into their usual chat,"
720,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Discoursing with important face,"
721,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"On ribbons, fans, and gloves, and lace;"
722,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Show'd patterns just from India brought,"
723,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And gravely ask'd her what she thought,"
724,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Whether the red or green were best,"
725,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And what they cost? Vanessa guess'd
726,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],As came into her fancy first;
727,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Named half the rates, and liked the worst."
728,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To scandal next--What awkward thing
729,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Was that last Sunday in the ring?
730,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],I'm sorry Mopsa breaks so fast:
731,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],I said her face would never last.
732,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Corinna, with that youthful air,"
733,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Is thirty, and a bit to spare:"
734,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Her fondness for a certain earl
735,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Began when I was but a girl!
736,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Phillis, who but a month ago"
737,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Was married to the Tunbridge beau,"
738,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],I saw coquetting t'other night
739,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],In public with that odious knight!
740,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],They rallied next Vanessa's dress:
741,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],That gown was made for old Queen Bess.
742,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Dear madam, let me see your head:"
743,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Don't you intend to put on red?
744,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],A petticoat without a hoop!
745,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Sure, you are not ashamed to stoop!"
746,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"With handsome garters at your knees,"
747,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],No matter what a fellow sees.
748,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Filled with disdain, with rage inflamed"
749,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Both of herself and sex ashamed,"
750,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The nymph stood silent out of spite,"
751,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Nor would vouchsafe to set them right.
752,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Away the fair detractors went,"
753,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And gave by turns their censures vent.
754,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She's not so handsome in my eyes:
755,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"For wit, I wonder where it lies!"
756,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She's fair and clean, and that's the most:"
757,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],But why proclaim her for a toast?
758,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A baby face; no life, no airs,"
759,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],But what she learn'd at country fairs;
760,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Scarce knows what difference is between
761,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Rich Flanders lace and Colberteen. [2]
762,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"I'll undertake, my little Nancy"
763,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],In flounces has a better fancy;
764,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"With all her wit, I would not ask"
765,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Her judgment how to buy a mask.
766,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"We begg'd her but to patch her face,"
767,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She never hit one proper place;
768,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Which every girl at five years old
769,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Can do as soon as she is told.
770,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"I own, that out-of-fashion stuff"
771,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Becomes the creature well enough.
772,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The girl might pass, if we could get her"
773,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To know the world a little better.
774,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],(To know the world! a modern phrase
775,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"For visits, ombre, balls, and plays.)"
776,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Thus, to the world's perpetual shame,"
777,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The Queen of Beauty lost her aim;
778,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Too late with grief she understood
779,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Pallas had done more harm than good;
780,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"For great examples are but vain,"
781,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Where ignorance begets disdain.
782,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Both sexes, arm'd with guilt and spite,"
783,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Against Vanessa's power unite:
784,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To copy her few nymphs aspired;
785,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Her virtues fewer swains admired.
786,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"So stars, beyond a certain height,"
787,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Give mortals neither heat nor light.
788,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Yet some of either sex, endow'd"
789,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"With gifts superior to the crowd,"
790,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"With virtue, knowledge, taste, and wit"
791,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She condescended to admit:
792,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],With pleasing arts she could reduce
793,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Men's talents to their proper use;
794,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And with address each genius held
795,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To that wherein it most excell'd;
796,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Thus, making others' wisdom known,"
797,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Could please them, and improve her own."
798,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],A modest youth said something new;
799,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She placed it in the strongest view.
800,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"All humble worth she strove to raise,"
801,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Would not be praised, yet loved to praise."
802,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The learned met with free approach,"
803,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Although they came not in a coach:
804,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Some clergy too she would allow,"
805,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Nor quarrell'd at their awkward bow;
806,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But this was for Cadenus' sake,"
807,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],A gownman of a different make;
808,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Whom Pallas once, Vanessa's tutor,"
809,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Had fix'd on for her coadjutor.
810,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But Cupid, full of mischief, longs"
811,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To vindicate his mother's wrongs.
812,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],On Pallas all attempts are vain:
813,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],One way he knows to give her pain;
814,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Vows on Vanessa's heart to take
815,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Due vengeance, for her patron's sake;"
816,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Those early seeds by Venus sown,"
817,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],In spite of Pallas now were grown;
818,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And Cupid hoped they would improve
819,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"By time, and ripen into love."
820,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The boy made use of all his craft,"
821,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"In vain discharging many a shaft,"
822,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Pointed at colonels, lords, and beaux:"
823,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Cadenus warded off the blows;
824,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"For, placing still some book betwixt,"
825,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The darts were in the cover fix'd,"
826,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Or, often blunted and recoil'd,"
827,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"On Plutarch's Moral struck, were spoil'd."
828,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The Queen of Wisdom could foresee,"
829,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But not prevent, the Fates' decree:"
830,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And human caution tries in vain
831,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To break that adamantine chain.
832,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Vanessa, though by Pallas taught,"
833,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"By Love invulnerable thought,"
834,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Searching in books for wisdom's aid,"
835,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Was, in the very search, betray'd."
836,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Cupid, though all his darts were lost,"
837,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Yet still resolved to spare no cost:
838,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],He could not answer to his fame
839,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The triumphs of that stubborn dame,"
840,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A nymph so hard to be subdued,"
841,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Who neither was coquette nor prude.
842,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"I find, said he, she wants a doctor,"
843,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Both to adore her, and instruct her:"
844,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],I'll give her what she most admires
845,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Among those venerable sires.
846,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Cadenus is a subject fit,"
847,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Grown old in politics and wit,"
848,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Caress'd by ministers of state,"
849,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Of half mankind the dread and hate.
850,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Whate'er vexations love attend,"
851,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She needs no rivals apprehend.
852,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Her sex, with universal voice,"
853,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Must laugh at her capricious choice.
854,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Cadenus many things had writ:
855,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Vanessa much esteem'd his wit,"
856,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And call'd for his poetic works:
857,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Meantime the boy in secret lurks;
858,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And, while the book was in her hand,"
859,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The urchin from his private stand
860,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Took aim, and shot with all his strength"
861,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A dart of such prodigious length,"
862,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"It pierced the feeble volume through,"
863,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And deep transfix'd her bosom too.
864,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Some lines, more moving than the rest,"
865,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Stuck to the point that pierced her breast,"
866,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And, borne directly to the heart,"
867,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],With pains unknown increased her smart.
868,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Vanessa, not in years a score,"
869,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Dreams of a gown of forty-four;
870,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Imaginary charms can find
871,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],In eyes with reading almost blind:
872,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Cadenus now no more appears
873,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Declined in health, advanced in years."
874,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She fancies music in his tongue;
875,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Nor farther looks, but thinks him young."
876,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],What mariner is not afraid
877,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To venture in a ship decay'd?
878,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],What planter will attempt to yoke
879,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],A sapling with a falling oak?
880,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"As years increase, she brighter shines;"
881,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Cadenus with each day declines:
882,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And he must fall a prey to time,"
883,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],While she continues in her prime.
884,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Cadenus, common forms apart,"
885,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],In every scene had kept his heart;
886,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Had sigh'd and languish'd, vow'd and writ,"
887,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"For pastime, or to show his wit,"
888,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But books, and time, and state affairs,"
889,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Had spoil'd his fashionable airs:
890,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"He now could praise, esteem, approve,"
891,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],But understood not what was love.
892,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],His conduct might have made him styled
893,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A father, and the nymph his child."
894,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],That innocent delight he took
895,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"To see the virgin mind her book,"
896,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Was but the master's secret joy
897,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],In school to hear the finest boy.
898,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Her knowledge with her fancy grew;
899,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She hourly press'd for something new;
900,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Ideas came into her mind
901,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"So fast, his lessons lagg'd behind;"
902,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She reason'd, without plodding long,"
903,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Nor ever gave her judgment wrong.
904,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],But now a sudden change was wrought;
905,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She minds no longer what he taught.
906,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Cadenus was amazed to find
907,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Such marks of a distracted mind:
908,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"For, though she seem'd to listen more"
909,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"To all he spoke, than e'er before,"
910,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"He found her thoughts would absent range,"
911,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Yet guess'd not whence could spring the change.
912,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And first he modestly conjectures
913,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],His pupil might be tired with lectures;
914,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Which help'd to mortify his pride,"
915,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Yet gave him not the heart to chide:
916,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But, in a mild dejected strain,"
917,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],At last he ventured to complain:
918,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Said, she should be no longer teazed,"
919,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Might have her freedom when she pleased;
920,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Was now convinced he acted wrong
921,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"To hide her from the world so long,"
922,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And in dull studies to engage
923,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],One of her tender sex and age;
924,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"That every nymph with envy own'd,"
925,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],How she might shine in the _grand monde_:
926,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And every shepherd was undone
927,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To see her cloister'd like a nun.
928,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],This was a visionary scheme:
929,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"He waked, and found it but a dream;"
930,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],A project far above his skill:
931,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],For nature must be nature still.
932,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],If he were bolder than became
933,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A scholar to a courtly dame,"
934,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She might excuse a man of letters;
935,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Thus tutors often treat their better;
936,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And, since his talk offensive grew,"
937,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],He came to take his last adieu.
938,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Vanessa, fill'd with just disdain,"
939,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Would still her dignity maintain,"
940,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Instructed from her early years
941,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To scorn the art of female tears.
942,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Had he employ'd his time so long
943,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To teach her what was right and wrong;
944,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Yet could such notions entertain
945,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],That all his lectures were in vain?
946,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She own'd the wandering of her thoughts;
947,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],But he must answer for her faults.
948,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She well remember'd to her cost,"
949,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],That all his lessons were not lost.
950,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Two maxims she could still produce,"
951,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And sad experience taught their use;
952,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"That virtue, pleased by being shown,"
953,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Knows nothing which it dares not own;
954,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Can make us without fear disclose
955,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Our inmost secrets to our foes;
956,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],That common forms were not design'd
957,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Directors to a noble mind.
958,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Now, said the nymph, to let you see"
959,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],My actions with your rules agree;
960,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"That I can vulgar forms despise,"
961,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And have no secrets to disguise;
962,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"I knew, by what you said and writ,"
963,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],How dangerous things were men of wit;
964,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"You caution'd me against their charms,"
965,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],But never gave me equal arms;
966,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Your lessons found the weakest part,"
967,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Aim'd at the head, but reach'd the heart."
968,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Cadenus felt within him rise
969,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Shame, disappointment, guilt, surprise."
970,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],He knew not how to reconcile
971,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Such language with her usual style:
972,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And yet her words were so exprest,"
973,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],He could not hope she spoke in jest.
974,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],His thoughts had wholly been confined
975,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To form and cultivate her mind.
976,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"He hardly knew, till he was told,"
977,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Whether the nymph were young or old;
978,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Had met her in a public place,"
979,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Without distinguishing her face;
980,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Much less could his declining age
981,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Vanessa's earliest thoughts engage;
982,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And, if her youth indifference met,"
983,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],His person must contempt beget;
984,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Or grant her passion be sincere,"
985,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],How shall his innocence be clear?
986,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"[3]Appearances were all so strong,"
987,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The world must think him in the wrong;
988,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Would say, he made a treacherous use"
989,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Of wit, to flatter and seduce;"
990,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The town would swear, he had betray'd"
991,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],By magic spells the harmless maid:
992,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And every beau would have his joke,"
993,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],That scholars were like other folk;
994,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And, when Platonic flights were over,"
995,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The tutor turn'd a mortal lover!
996,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],So tender of the young and fair!
997,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],It show'd a true paternal care--
998,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Five thousand guineas in her purse!
999,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The doctor might have fancied worse.--
1000,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Hardly at length he silence broke,"
1001,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And falter'd every word he spoke;
1002,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Interpreting her complaisance,"
1003,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Just as a man _sans_ consequence.
1004,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She rallied well, he always knew:"
1005,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Her manner now was something new;
1006,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And what she spoke was in an air
1007,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],As serious as a tragic player.
1008,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],But those who aim at ridicule
1009,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Should fix upon some certain rule,"
1010,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Which fairly hints they are in jest,"
1011,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Else he must enter his protest:
1012,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"For let a man be ne'er so wise,"
1013,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],He may be caught with sober lies;
1014,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A science which he never taught,"
1015,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And, to be free, was dearly bought;"
1016,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"For, take it in its proper light,"
1017,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],'Tis just what coxcombs call a bite.
1018,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But, not to dwell on things minute,"
1019,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Vanessa finish'd the dispute;
1020,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Brought weighty arguments to prove
1021,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],That reason was her guide in love.
1022,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She thought he had himself described,"
1023,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],His doctrines when she first imbibed;
1024,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"What he had planted, now was grown;"
1025,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],His virtues she might call her own;
1026,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"As he approves, as he dislikes,"
1027,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Love or contempt her fancy strikes.
1028,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Self-love, in nature rooted fast,"
1029,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Attends us first, and leaves us last;"
1030,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Why she likes him, admire not at her;"
1031,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She loves herself, and that's the matter."
1032,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],How was her tutor wont to praise
1033,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The geniuses of ancient days!
1034,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"(Those authors he so oft had named,"
1035,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"For learning, wit, and wisdom, famed;)"
1036,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Was struck with love, esteem, and awe,"
1037,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],For persons whom he never saw.
1038,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Suppose Cadenus flourish'd then,"
1039,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],He must adore such godlike men.
1040,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],If one short volume could comprise
1041,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"All that was witty, learn'd, and wise,"
1042,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"How would it be esteem'd and read,"
1043,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Although the writer long were dead!
1044,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"If such an author were alive,"
1045,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"How all would for his friendship strive,"
1046,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And come in crowds to see his face!
1047,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And this she takes to be her case.
1048,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Cadenus answers every end,"
1049,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The book, the author, and the friend;"
1050,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The utmost her desires will reach,"
1051,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Is but to learn what he can teach:
1052,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],His converse is a system fit
1053,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Alone to fill up all her wit;
1054,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],While every passion of her mind
1055,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],In him is centred and confined.
1056,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Love can with speech inspire a mute,"
1057,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And taught Vanessa to dispute.
1058,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"This topic, never touch'd before,"
1059,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Display'd her eloquence the more:
1060,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Her knowledge, with such pains acquired,"
1061,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],By this new passion grew inspired;
1062,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Through this she made all objects pass,"
1063,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Which gave a tincture o'er the mass;
1064,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"As rivers, though they bend and twine,"
1065,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Still to the sea their course incline:
1066,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Or, as philosophers, who find"
1067,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Some favourite system to their mind;
1068,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"In every point to make it fit,"
1069,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Will force all nature to submit.
1070,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Cadenus, who could ne'er suspect"
1071,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"His lessons would have such effect,"
1072,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Or be so artfully applied,"
1073,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Insensibly came on her side.
1074,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],It was an unforeseen event;
1075,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Things took a turn he never meant.
1076,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Whoe'er excels in what we prize,"
1077,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Appears a hero in our eyes;
1078,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Each girl, when pleased with what is taught,"
1079,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Will have the teacher in her thought.
1080,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"When miss delights in her spinet,"
1081,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],A fiddler may a fortune get;
1082,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A blockhead, with melodious voice,"
1083,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],In boarding-schools may have his choice:
1084,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And oft the dancing-master's art
1085,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Climbs from the toe to touch the heart.
1086,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"In learning let a nymph delight,"
1087,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The pedant gets a mistress by't.
1088,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Cadenus, to his grief and shame,"
1089,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Could scarce oppose Vanessa's flame;
1090,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And, though her arguments were strong,"
1091,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],At least could hardly wish them wrong.
1092,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Howe'er it came, he could not tell,"
1093,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],But sure she never talk'd so well.
1094,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],His pride began to interpose;
1095,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Preferr'd before a crowd of beaux!
1096,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],So bright a nymph to come unsought!
1097,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Such wonder by his merit wrought!
1098,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],'Tis merit must with her prevail!
1099,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],He never knew her judgment fail!
1100,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She noted all she ever read!
1101,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And had a most discerning head!
1102,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"'Tis an old maxim in the schools,"
1103,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],That flattery's the food of fools;
1104,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Yet now and then your men of wit
1105,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Will condescend to take a bit.
1106,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"So when Cadenus could not hide,"
1107,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],He chose to justify his pride;
1108,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Construing the passion she had shown,"
1109,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Much to her praise, more to his own."
1110,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Nature in him had merit placed,"
1111,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],In her a most judicious taste.
1112,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Love, hitherto a transient guest,"
1113,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Ne'er held possession of his breast;
1114,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"So long attending at the gate,"
1115,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Disdain'd to enter in so late.
1116,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Love why do we one passion call,"
1117,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],When 'tis a compound of them all?
1118,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Where hot and cold, where sharp and sweet,"
1119,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],In all their equipages meet;
1120,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Where pleasures mix'd with pains appear,"
1121,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Sorrow with joy, and hope with fear;"
1122,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Wherein his dignity and age
1123,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Forbid Cadenus to engage.
1124,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But friendship, in its greatest height,"
1125,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A constant, rational delight,"
1126,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"On virtue's basis fix'd to last,"
1127,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"When love allurements long are past,"
1128,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Which gently warms, but cannot burn,"
1129,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],He gladly offers in return;
1130,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],His want of passion will redeem
1131,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"With gratitude, respect, esteem:"
1132,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"With what devotion we bestow,"
1133,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],When goddesses appear below.
1134,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],While thus Cadenus entertains
1135,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Vanessa in exalted strains,"
1136,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The nymph in sober words entreats
1137,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],A truce with all sublime conceits;
1138,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"For why such raptures, flights, and fancies,"
1139,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To her who durst not read romances?
1140,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"In lofty style to make replies,"
1141,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Which he had taught her to despise?
1142,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],But when her tutor will affect
1143,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Devotion, duty, and respect,"
1144,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],He fairly abdicates the throne:
1145,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The government is now her own;
1146,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],He has a forfeiture incurr'd;
1147,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She vows to take him at his word,"
1148,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And hopes he will not think it strange
1149,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"If both should now their stations change,"
1150,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The nymph will have her turn to be
1151,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The tutor; and the pupil, he;"
1152,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Though she already can discern
1153,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Her scholar is not apt to learn;
1154,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Or wants capacity to reach
1155,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The science she designs to teach;
1156,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Wherein his genius was below
1157,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The skill of every common beau,"
1158,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Who, though he cannot spell, is wise"
1159,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Enough to read a lady's eyes,"
1160,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],And will each accidental glance
1161,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Interpret for a kind advance.
1162,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But what success Vanessa met,"
1163,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Is to the world a secret yet.
1164,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Whether the nymph, to please her swain,"
1165,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Talks in a high romantic strain;
1166,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Or whether he at last descends
1167,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To act with less seraphic ends;
1168,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Or to compound the business, whether"
1169,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],They temper love and books together;
1170,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Must never to mankind be told,"
1171,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Nor shall the conscious Muse unfold.
1172,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Meantime the mournful Queen of Love
1173,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Led but a weary life above.
1174,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She ventures now to leave the skies,"
1175,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Grown by Vanessa's conduct wise:
1176,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],For though by one perverse event
1177,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Pallas had cross'd her first intent;
1178,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Though her design was not obtain'd:
1179,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Yet had she much experience gain'd,"
1180,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And, by the project vainly tried,"
1181,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Could better now the cause decide.
1182,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She gave due notice, that both parties,"
1183,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"_Coram Regina, prox' die Martis,_"
1184,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Should at their peril, without fail,"
1185,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Come and appear, and save their bail."
1186,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"All met; and, silence thrice proclaimed,"
1187,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],One lawyer to each side was named.
1188,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The judge discover'd in her face
1189,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Resentments for her late disgrace;
1190,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And full of anger, shame, and grief,"
1191,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Directed them to mind their brief;
1192,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Nor spend their time to show their reading:
1193,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She'd have a summary proceeding.
1194,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She gather'd under every head
1195,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The sum of what each lawyer said,"
1196,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Gave her own reasons last, and then"
1197,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Decreed the cause against the men.
1198,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But in a weighty case like this,"
1199,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"To show she did not judge amiss,"
1200,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Which evil tongues might else report,"
1201,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She made a speech in open court;
1202,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Wherein she grievously complains,"
1203,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"""How she was cheated by the swains;"
1204,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"On whose petition (humbly showing,"
1205,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"That women were not worth the wooing,"
1206,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And that, unless the sex would mend,"
1207,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The race of lovers soon must end)--
1208,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She was at Lord knows what expense
1209,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"To form a nymph of wit and sense,"
1210,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"A model for her sex design'd,"
1211,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Who never could one lover find.
1212,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She saw her favour was misplaced;
1213,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The fellows had a wretched taste;
1214,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She needs must tell them to their face,"
1215,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"They were a stupid, senseless race;"
1216,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And, were she to begin again,"
1217,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She'd study to reform the men;
1218,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Or add some grains of folly more
1219,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"To women, than they had before,"
1220,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],To put them on an equal foot;
1221,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And this, or nothing else, would do't."
1222,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],This might their mutual fancy strike;
1223,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],Since every being loves its like.
1224,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"""But now, repenting what was done,"
1225,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],She left all business to her son;
1226,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"She put the world in his possession,"
1227,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"And let him use it at discretion."""
1228,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The crier was order'd to dismiss
1229,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"The court, who made his last ""O yes!"""
1230,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],The goddess would no longer wait;
1231,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"But, rising from her chair of state,"
1232,CADENUS AND VANESSA[1],"Left all below at six and seven,"

1696,TO STELLA VISITING ME IN MY SICKNESS,Her hearers are amazed from whence

1704,TO STELLA VISITING ME IN MY SICKNESS,No; 'twas for you alone he stole

1708,TO STELLA VISITING ME IN MY SICKNESS,"To that you owe the nobler flame,"
1709,TO STELLA VISITING ME IN MY SICKNESS,To this the beauty of your frame.
1710,TO STELLA VISITING ME IN MY SICKNESS,"How would Ingratitude delight,"

1730,TO STELLA VISITING ME IN MY SICKNESS,"I see her taste each nauseous draught,"
1731,TO STELLA VISITING ME IN MY SICKNESS,And so obligingly am caught;
1732,TO STELLA VISITING ME IN MY SICKNESS,"I bless the hand from whence they came,"
1733,TO STELLA VISITING ME IN MY SICKNESS,Nor dare distort my face for shame.
1734,TO STELLA VISITING ME IN MY SICKNESS,Best pattern of true friends! beware;

2535,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730",Lord Orrery gives us the following curious anecdote respecting this

2537,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730",
2538,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730","""I have just now cast my eye over a poem called 'Death and Daphne,' which"

2540,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730","after our acquaintance, introduced me to her as to one of his female"
2541,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730","favourites. I had scarce been half an hour in her company, before she"
2542,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730",asked me if I had seen the Dean's poem upon 'Death and Daphne.' As I
2543,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730","told her I had not, she immediately unlocked a cabinet, and, bringing out"
2544,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730","the manuscript, read it to me with a seeming satisfaction, of which, at"
2545,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730","that time, I doubted the sincerity. While she was reading, the Dean was"
2546,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730","perpetually correcting her for bad pronunciation, and for placing a wrong"
2547,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730",emphasis upon particular words. As soon as she had gone through the
2548,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730","composition, she assured me, smilingly, that the portrait of Daphne was"
2549,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730",drawn for herself. I begged to be excused from believing it; and
2550,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730",protested that I could not see one feature that had the least
2551,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730",resemblance; but the Dean immediately burst into a fit of laughter. 'You
2552,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730","fancy,' says he, 'that you are very polite, but you are much mistaken."
2553,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730","That lady had rather be a Daphne drawn by me, than a Sacharissa by any"

2555,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730","that I had no other method of retrieving my error, than by whispering in"
2556,"TO AN AGREEABLE YOUNG LADY, BUT EXTREMELY LEAN. 1730","her ear, as I was conducting her down stairs to dinner, that indeed I"

4324,"JULY 28, 1728",Like a clock without wheels;
4325,"JULY 28, 1728","I sink in the spleen,"
4326,"JULY 28, 1728",A useless machine.
4327,"JULY 28, 1728","If he had his will,"
4328,"JULY 28, 1728",I should never sit still:
4329,"JULY 28, 1728",He comes with his whims
4330,"JULY 28, 1728",I must move my limbs;
4331,"JULY 28, 1728",I cannot be sweet

4335,"JULY 28, 1728","By the worst of all squires,"

4337,"JULY 28, 1728","Where a cow would be startled,"
4338,"JULY 28, 1728",I'm in spite of my heart led;
4339,"JULY 28, 1728","And, say what I will,"
4340,"JULY 28, 1728",Haul'd up every hill;
4341,"JULY 28, 1728","Till, daggled and tatter'd,"
4342,"JULY 28, 1728","My spirits quite shatter'd,"
4343,"JULY 28, 1728","I return home at night,"
4344,"JULY 28, 1728","And fast, out of spite:"

4348,"JULY 28, 1728",In stomach or limb.
4349,"JULY 28, 1728",But now to my diet;
4350,"JULY 28, 1728","No eating in quiet,"
4351,"JULY 28, 1728","He's still finding fault,"
4352,"JULY 28, 1728",Too sour or too salt:
4353,"JULY 28, 1728",The wing of a chick
4354,"JULY 28, 1728",I hardly can pick:
4355,"JULY 28, 1728",But trash without measure
4356,"JULY 28, 1728",I swallow with pleasure.
4357,"JULY 28, 1728","Next, for his diversion,"
4358,"JULY 28, 1728",He rails at my person.
4359,"JULY 28, 1728",What court breeding this is!
4360,"JULY 28, 1728",He takes me to pieces:
4361,"JULY 28, 1728",From shoulder to flank
4362,"JULY 28, 1728",I'm lean and am lank;
4363,"JULY 28, 1728","My nose, long and thin,"
4364,"JULY 28, 1728",Grows down to my chin;
4365,"JULY 28, 1728","My chin will not stay,"
4366,"JULY 28, 1728",But meets it halfway;
4367,"JULY 28, 1728","My fingers, prolix,"
4368,"JULY 28, 1728",Are ten crooked sticks:
4369,"JULY 28, 1728",He swears my el--bows
4370,"JULY 28, 1728","Are two iron crows,"
4371,"JULY 28, 1728","Or sharp pointed rocks,"
4372,"JULY 28, 1728",And wear out my smocks:
4373,"JULY 28, 1728","To 'scape them, Sir Arthur"
4374,"JULY 28, 1728","Is forced to lie farther,"
4375,"JULY 28, 1728",Or his sides they would gore
4376,"JULY 28, 1728",Like the tusks of a boar.
4377,"JULY 28, 1728",Now changing the scene
4378,"JULY 28, 1728",But still to the Dean;
4379,"JULY 28, 1728",He loves to be bitter at
4380,"JULY 28, 1728",A lady illiterate;
4381,"JULY 28, 1728","If he sees her but once,"
4382,"JULY 28, 1728",He'll swear she's a dunce;
4383,"JULY 28, 1728",Can tell by her looks
4384,"JULY 28, 1728",A hater of books;
4385,"JULY 28, 1728",Thro' each line of her face
4386,"JULY 28, 1728",Her folly can trace;
4387,"JULY 28, 1728",Which spoils every feature
4388,"JULY 28, 1728",Bestow'd her by nature;
4389,"JULY 28, 1728",But sense gives a grace
4390,"JULY 28, 1728",To the homeliest face:
4391,"JULY 28, 1728",Wise books and reflection
4392,"JULY 28, 1728",Will mend the complexion:

4395,"JULY 28, 1728","No lady who wants them,"

4397,"JULY 28, 1728",I guess well enough
4398,"JULY 28, 1728",What he means by this stuff:

4407,"JULY 28, 1728",How the hussies will fleer

4965,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"With so conversable a friend,"

4970,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Though I should see him twice a-day,"

4972,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,If all my rhetoric must fail
4973,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,To strike him for a pot of ale?
4974,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Thus, when the learned and the wise"
4975,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Conceal their talents from our eyes,"
4976,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,And from deserving friends withhold
4977,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Their gifts, as misers do their gold;"
4978,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Their knowledge to themselves confined
4979,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Is the same avarice of mind;
4980,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Nor makes their conversation better,"
4981,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Than if they never knew a letter.
4982,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Such is the fate of Gosford's knight,"
4983,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Who keeps his wisdom out of sight;
4984,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Whose uncommunicative heart

4987,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,His outward senses fast asleep;
4988,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Who, while I talk, a song will hum,"
4989,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Or with his fingers beat the drum;
4990,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Beyond the skies transports his mind,"
4991,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,And leaves a lifeless corpse behind.
4992,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"But, as for me, who ne'er could clamber high,"
4993,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,To understand Malebranche or Cambray;
4994,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Who send my mind (as I believe) less
4995,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Than others do, on errands sleeveless;"
4996,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Can listen to a tale humdrum,"

4998,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"My spirits with my body progging,"
4999,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Both hand in hand together jogging;
5000,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Sunk over head and ears in matter.
5001,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Nor can of metaphysics smatter;
5002,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Am more diverted with a quibble
5003,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Than dream of words intelligible;
5004,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,And think all notions too abstracted
5005,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Are like the ravings of a crackt head;
5006,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,What intercourse of minds can be
5007,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Betwixt the knight sublime and me,"
5008,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"If when I talk, as talk I must,"
5009,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,It is but prating to a bust?
5010,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Where friendship is by Fate design'd,"
5011,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,It forms a union in the mind:
5012,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,But here I differ from the knight
5013,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"In every point, like black and white:"
5014,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,For none can say that ever yet
5015,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,We both in one opinion met:
5016,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Not in philosophy, or ale;"
5017,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"In state affairs, or planting kale;"
5018,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"In rhetoric, or picking straws;"
5019,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"In roasting larks, or making laws;"
5020,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"In public schemes, or catching flies;"
5021,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"In parliaments, or pudding pies."
5022,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,The neighbours wonder why the knight
5023,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Should in a country life delight,"
5024,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Who not one pleasure entertains
5025,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,To cheer the solitary scenes:
5026,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"His guests are few, his visits rare;"
5027,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Nor uses time, nor time will spare;"
5028,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Nor rides, nor walks, nor hunts, nor fowls,"
5029,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Nor plays at cards, or dice, or bowls;"
5030,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"But seated in an easy-chair,"
5031,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Despises exercise and air.
5032,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,His rural walks he ne'er adorns;
5033,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Here poor Pomona sits on thorns:
5034,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,And there neglected Flora settles
5035,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Her bum upon a bed of nettles.
5036,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Those thankless and officious cares
5037,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"I used to take in friends' affairs,"
5038,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"From which I never could refrain,"
5039,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,And have been often chid in vain;
5040,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"From these I am recover'd quite,"
5041,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,At least in what regards the knight.
5042,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"Preserve his health, his store increase;"
5043,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,May nothing interrupt his peace!
5044,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,But now let all his tenants round
5045,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"First milk his cows, and after, pound;"
5046,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,Let every cottager conspire
5047,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,To cut his hedges down for fire;
5048,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,The naughty boys about the village
5049,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,His crabs and sloes may freely pillage;
5050,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,He still may keep a pack of knaves
5051,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"To spoil his work, and work by halves;"
5052,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,"His meadows may be dug by swine,"
5053,FOR NOT BUILDING AT DRAPIER'S-HILL,It shall be no concern of mine;

5065,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,
5066,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,From distant regions Fortune sends
5067,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,An odd triumvirate of friends;
5068,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Where Phoebus pays a scanty stipend,"
5069,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Where never yet a codling ripen'd:
5070,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Hither the frantic goddess draws
5071,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Three sufferers in a ruin'd cause:
5072,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"By faction banish'd, here unite,"
5073,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"A Dean,[1] a Spaniard,[2] and a Knight;[3]"
5074,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Unite, but on conditions cruel;"
5075,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"The Dean and Spaniard find it too well,"
5076,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Condemn'd to live in service hard;
5077,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,On either side his honour's guard:
5078,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"The Dean to guard his honour's back,"
5079,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Must build a castle at Drumlack;[4]
5080,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"The Spaniard, sore against his will,"
5081,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Must raise a fort at Market-Hill.
5082,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,And thus the pair of humble gentry
5083,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,At north and south are posted sentry;
5084,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"While in his lordly castle fixt,"
5085,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,The knight triumphant reigns betwixt:
5086,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"And, what the wretches most resent,"
5087,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"To be his slaves, must pay him rent;"
5088,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Attend him daily as their chief,"
5089,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Decant his wine, and carve his beef."
5090,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,O Fortune! 'tis a scandal for thee
5091,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,To smile on those who are least worthy:
5092,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Weigh but the merits of the three,"
5093,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,His slaves have ten times more than he.
5094,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Proud baronet of Nova Scotia!
5095,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,The Dean and Spaniard must reproach ye:
5096,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Of their two fames the world enough rings:
5097,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Where are thy services and sufferings?
5098,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"What if for nothing once you kiss'd,"
5099,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Against the grain, a monarch's fist?"
5100,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"What if, among the courtly tribe,"
5101,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,You lost a place and saved a bribe?
5102,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"And then in surly mood came here,"
5103,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"To fifteen hundred pounds a-year,"
5104,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,And fierce against the Whigs harangu'd?
5105,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,You never ventured to be hang'd.
5106,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,How dare you treat your betters thus?
5107,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Are you to be compared with us?
5108,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Come, Spaniard, let us from our farms"
5109,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Call forth our cottagers to arms:
5110,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Our forces let us both unite,"
5111,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Attack the foe at left and right;
5112,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"From Market-Hill's[5] exalted head,"
5113,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Full northward let your troops be led;
5114,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"While I from Drapier's-Mount descend,"
5115,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,And to the south my squadrons bend.
5116,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"New-River Walk, with friendly shade,"
5117,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Shall keep my host in ambuscade;
5118,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"While you, from where the basin stands,"
5119,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Shall scale the rampart with your bands.
5120,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Nor need we doubt the fort to win;
5121,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,I hold intelligence within.
5122,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"True, Lady Anne no danger fears,"
5123,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Brave as the Upton fan she wears;[6]
5124,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Then, lest upon our first attack"
5125,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Her valiant arm should force us back,"
5126,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,And we of all our hopes deprived;
5127,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,I have a stratagem contrived.
5128,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,By these embroider'd high-heel shoes
5129,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,She shall be caught as in a noose:
5130,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"So well contriv'd her toes to pinch,"
5131,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,She'll not have power to stir an inch:
5132,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,These gaudy shoes must Hannah [7] place
5133,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Direct before her lady's face;
5134,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"The shoes put on, our faithful portress"
5135,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Admits us in, to storm the fortress,"
5136,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"While tortured madam bound remains,"
5137,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Like Montezume,[8] in golden chains;"
5138,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Or like a cat with walnuts shod,"
5139,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Stumbling at every step she trod.
5140,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Sly hunters thus, in Borneo's isle,"
5141,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"To catch a monkey by a wile,"
5142,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,The mimic animal amuse;
5143,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,They place before him gloves and shoes;
5144,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Which, when the brute puts awkward on:"
5145,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,All his agility is gone;
5146,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,In vain to frisk or climb he tries;
5147,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,The huntsmen seize the grinning prize.
5148,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,But let us on our first assault
5149,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Secure the larder and the vault;
5150,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"The valiant Dennis,[9] you must fix on,"
5151,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,And I'll engage with Peggy Dixon:[10]
5152,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Then, if we once can seize the key"
5153,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"And chest that keeps my lady's tea,"
5154,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,They must surrender at discretion!
5155,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"And, soon as we have gain'd possession,"
5156,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"We'll act as other conquerors do,"
5157,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Divide the realm between us two;
5158,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Then, (let me see,) we'll make the knight"
5159,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Our clerk, for he can read and write."
5160,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"But must not think, I tell him that,"
5161,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,Like Lorimer [11] to wear his hat;
5162,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Yet, when we dine without a friend,"
5163,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,We'll place him at the lower end.
5164,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"Madam, whose skill does all in dress lie,"
5165,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,May serve to wait on Mrs. Leslie;
5166,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"But, lest it might not be so proper"
5167,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"That her own maid should over-top her,"
5168,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"To mortify the creature more,"
5169,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,We'll take her heels five inches lower.
5170,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"For Hannah, when we have no need of her,"
5171,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,'Twill be our interest to get rid of her;
5172,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,"And when we execute our plot,"
5173,THE REVOLUTION AT MARKET-HILL,'Tis best to hang her on the spot;

5280,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,
5281,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,IN THE PERSON OF A LADY IN THE NORTH [l] 1730
5282,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,
5283,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Resolved my gratitude to show,"
5284,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Thrice reverend Dean, for all I owe,"
5285,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Too long I have my thanks delay'd;
5286,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Your favours left too long unpaid;
5287,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"But now, in all our sex's name,"
5288,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,My artless Muse shall sing your fame.
5289,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Indulgent you to female kind,"
5290,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To all their weaker sides are blind:
5291,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Nine more such champions as the Dean
5292,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Would soon restore our ancient reign;
5293,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"How well to win the ladies' hearts,"
5294,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,You celebrate their wit and parts!
5295,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"How have I felt my spirits raised,"
5296,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"By you so oft, so highly praised!"
5297,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Transform'd by your convincing tongue
5298,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"To witty, beautiful, and young,"
5299,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"I hope to quit that awkward shame,"
5300,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Affected by each vulgar dame,"
5301,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To modesty a weak pretence;
5302,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,And soon grow pert on men of sense;
5303,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To show my face with scornful air;
5304,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Let others match it if they dare.
5305,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Impatient to be out of debt,"
5306,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"O, may I never once forget"
5307,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,The bard who humbly deigns to chuse
5308,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Me for the subject of his Muse!
5309,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Behind my back, before my nose,"
5310,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,He sounds my praise in verse and prose.
5311,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"My heart with emulation burns,"
5312,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To make you suitable returns;
5313,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,My gratitude the world shall know;
5314,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"And see, the printer's boy below;"
5315,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Ye hawkers all, your voices lift;"
5316,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"""A Panegyric on Dean Swift!"""
5317,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"And then, to mend the matter still,"
5318,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"""By Lady Anne of Market-Hill!""[2]"
5319,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,I thus begin: My grateful Muse
5320,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Salutes the Dean in different views;
5321,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Dean, butler, usher, jester, tutor;"
5322,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Robert and Darby's[3] coadjutor;
5323,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"And, as you in commission sit,"
5324,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To rule the dairy next to Kit;[4]
5325,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,In each capacity I mean
5326,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To sing your praise. And first as Dean:
5327,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Envy must own, you understand your"
5328,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Precedence, and support your grandeur:"
5329,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Nor of your rank will bate an ace,"
5330,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Except to give Dean Daniel[5] place.
5331,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"In you such dignity appears,"
5332,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,So suited to your state and years!
5333,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,With ladies what a strict decorum!
5334,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,With what devotion you adore 'em!
5335,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Treat me with so much complaisance,"
5336,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,As fits a princess in romance!
5337,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"By your example and assistance,"
5338,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,The fellows learn to know their distance.
5339,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Sir Arthur, since you set the pattern,"
5340,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"No longer calls me snipe and slattern,"
5341,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Nor dares he, though he were a duke,"
5342,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Offend me with the least rebuke.
5343,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Proceed we to your preaching [5] next!
5344,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,How nice you split the hardest text!
5345,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,How your superior learning shines
5346,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Above our neighbouring dull divines!
5347,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,At Beggar's Opera not so full pit
5348,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Is seen as when you mount our pulpit.
5349,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Consider now your conversation:
5350,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Regardful of your age and station,"
5351,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,You ne'er were known by passion stirr'd
5352,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To give the least offensive word:
5353,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"But still, whene'er you silence break,"
5354,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Watch every syllable you speak:
5355,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Your style so clear, and so concise,"
5356,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,We never ask to hear you twice.
5357,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"But then a parson so genteel,"
5358,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,So nicely clad from head to heel;
5359,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"So fine a gown, a band so clean,"
5360,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"As well become St. Patrick's Dean,"
5361,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Such reverential awe express,"
5362,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,That cowboys know you by your dress!
5363,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Then, if our neighbouring friends come here"
5364,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"How proud are we when you appear,"
5365,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"With such address and graceful port,"
5366,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,As clearly shows you bred at court!
5367,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Now raise your spirits, Mr. Dean,"
5368,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,I lead you to a nobler scene.
5369,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"When to the vault you walk in state,"
5370,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,In quality of butler's [6] mate;
5371,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,You next to Dennis [7] bear the sway:
5372,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To you we often trust the key:
5373,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Nor can he judge with all his art
5374,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"So well, what bottle holds a quart:"
5375,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,What pints may best for bottles pass
5376,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Just to give every man his glass:
5377,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,When proper to produce the best;
5378,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,And what may serve a common guest.
5379,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"With Dennis you did ne'er combine,"
5380,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Not you, to steal your master's wine,"
5381,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Except a bottle now and then,"
5382,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To welcome brother serving-men;
5383,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"But that is with a good design,"
5384,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"To drink Sir Arthur's health and mine,"
5385,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Your master's honour to maintain:
5386,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,And get the like returns again.
5387,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Your usher's[8] post must next be handled:
5388,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,How blest am I by such a man led!
5389,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Under whose wise and careful guardship
5390,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"I now despise fatigue and hardship,"
5391,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Familiar grown to dirt and wet,"
5392,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Though draggled round, I scorn to fret:"
5393,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,From you my chamber damsels learn
5394,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,My broken hose to patch and darn.
5395,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Now as a jester I accost you;
5396,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Which never yet one friend has lost you.
5397,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"You judge so nicely to a hair,"
5398,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"How far to go, and when to spare;"
5399,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"By long experience grown so wise,"
5400,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Of every taste to know the size;
5401,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,There's none so ignorant or weak
5402,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To take offence at what you speak.[9]
5403,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Whene'er you joke, 'tis all a case"
5404,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Whether with Dermot, or his grace;"
5405,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"With Teague O'Murphy, or an earl;"
5406,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"A duchess, or a kitchen girl."
5407,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,With such dexterity you fit
5408,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Their several talents with your wit,"
5409,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"That Moll the chambermaid can smoke,"
5410,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,And Gahagan[10] take every joke.
5411,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,I now become your humble suitor
5412,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To let me praise you as my tutor.[11]
5413,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Poor I, a savage[12] bred and born,"
5414,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"By you instructed every morn,"
5415,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Already have improved so well,"
5416,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,That I have almost learnt to spell:
5417,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"The neighbours who come here to dine,"
5418,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Admire to hear me speak so fine.
5419,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"How enviously the ladies look,"
5420,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,When they surprise me at my book!
5421,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"And sure as they're alive at night,"
5422,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,As soon as gone will show their spight:
5423,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Good lord! what can my lady mean,"
5424,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Conversing with that rusty Dean!
5425,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"She's grown so nice, and so penurious,[13]"
5426,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,With Socrates and Epicurius!
5427,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"How could she sit the livelong day,"
5428,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Yet never ask us once to play?
5429,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,But I admire your patience most;
5430,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"That when I'm duller than a post,"
5431,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Nor can the plainest word pronounce,"
5432,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"You neither fume, nor fret, nor flounce;"
5433,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Are so indulgent, and so mild,"
5434,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,As if I were a darling child.
5435,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"So gentle is your whole proceeding,"
5436,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,That I could spend my life in reading.
5437,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,You merit new employments daily:
5438,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Our thatcher, ditcher, gardener, baily."
5439,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,And to a genius so extensive
5440,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,No work is grievous or offensive:
5441,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Whether your fruitful fancy lies
5442,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To make for pigs convenient styes;
5443,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Or ponder long with anxious thought
5444,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To banish rats that haunt our vault:
5445,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Nor have you grumbled, reverend Dean,"
5446,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To keep our poultry sweet and clean;
5447,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"To sweep the mansion-house they dwell in,"
5448,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,And cure the rank unsavoury smelling.
5449,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Now enter as the dairy handmaid:
5450,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Such charming butter [14] never man made.
5451,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Let others with fanatic face
5452,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Talk of their milk for babes of grace;
5453,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,From tubs their snuffling nonsense utter;
5454,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Thy milk shall make us tubs of butter.
5455,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"The bishop with his foot may burn it,[15]"
5456,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,But with his hand the Dean can churn it.
5457,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,How are the servants overjoy'd
5458,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To see thy deanship thus employ'd!
5459,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Instead of poring on a book,"
5460,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Providing butter for the cook!
5461,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Three morning hours you toss and shake
5462,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,The bottle till your fingers ache;
5463,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Hard is the toil, nor small the art,"
5464,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,The butter from the whey to part:
5465,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Behold a frothy substance rise;
5466,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Be cautious or your bottle flies.
5467,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"The butter comes, our fears are ceased;"
5468,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,And out you squeeze an ounce at least.
5469,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Your reverence thus, with like success,"
5470,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"(Nor is your skill or labour less,)"
5471,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"When bent upon some smart lampoon,"
5472,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Will toss and turn your brain till noon;
5473,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Which in its jumblings round the skull,"
5474,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Dilates and makes the vessel full:
5475,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"While nothing comes but froth at first,"
5476,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,You think your giddy head will burst;
5477,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"But squeezing out four lines in rhyme,"
5478,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Are largely paid for all your time.
5479,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,But you have raised your generous mind
5480,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To works of more exalted kind.
5481,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Palladio was not half so skill'd in
5482,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,The grandeur or the art of building.
5483,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Two temples of magnific size
5484,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Attract the curious traveller's eyes,"
5485,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,That might be envied by the Greeks;
5486,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Raised up by you in twenty weeks:
5487,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Here gentle goddess Cloacine
5488,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Receives all offerings at her shrine.
5489,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"In separate cells, the he's and she's,"
5490,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Here pay their vows on bended knees:
5491,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"For 'tis profane when sexes mingle,"
5492,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,And every nymph must enter single;
5493,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"And when she feels an inward motion,"
5494,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Come fill'd with reverence and devotion.
5495,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"The bashful maid, to hide her blush,"
5496,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Shall creep no more behind a bush;
5497,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Here unobserved she boldly goes,"
5498,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"As who should say, to pluck a rose,[16]"
5499,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Ye, who frequent this hallow'd scene,"
5500,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Be not ungrateful to the Dean;
5501,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"But duly, ere you leave your station,"
5502,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Offer to him a pure libation,"
5503,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Or of his own or Smedley's lay,"
5504,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Or billet-doux, or lock of hay:"
5505,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"And, O! may all who hither come,"
5506,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Return with unpolluted thumb!
5507,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Yet, when your lofty domes I praise"
5508,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,I sigh to think of ancient days.
5509,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Permit me then to raise my style,"
5510,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,And sweetly moralize a-while.
5511,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Thee, bounteous goddess Cloacine,"
5512,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To temples why do we confine?
5513,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Forbid in open air to breathe,"
5514,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Why are thine altars fix'd beneath?
5515,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"When Saturn ruled the skies alone,"
5516,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"(That golden age to gold unknown,)"
5517,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"This earthly globe, to thee assign'd,"
5518,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Received the gifts of all mankind.
5519,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Ten thousand altars smoking round,"
5520,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Were built to thee with offerings crown'd;
5521,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,And here thy daily votaries placed
5522,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Their sacrifice with zeal and haste:
5523,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,The margin of a purling stream
5524,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Sent up to thee a grateful steam;
5525,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Though sometimes thou wert pleased to wink,"
5526,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,If Naiads swept them from the brink:
5527,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Or where appointing lovers rove,"
5528,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,The shelter of a shady grove;
5529,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Or offer'd in some flowery vale,"
5530,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Were wafted by a gentle gale,"
5531,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"There many a flower abstersive grew,"
5532,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Thy favourite flowers of yellow hue;
5533,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"The crocus and the daffodil,"
5534,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"The cowslip soft, and sweet jonquil."
5535,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,But when at last usurping Jove
5536,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Old Saturn from his empire drove,"
5537,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Then gluttony, with greasy paws"
5538,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Her napkin pinn'd up to her jaws,"
5539,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"With watery chops, and wagging chin,"
5540,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Braced like a drum her oily skin;
5541,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Wedged in a spacious elbow-chair,"
5542,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"And on her plate a treble share,"
5543,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"As if she ne'er could have enough,"
5544,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Taught harmless man to cram and stuff.
5545,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,She sent her priests in wooden shoes
5546,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,From haughty Gaul to make ragouts;
5547,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Instead of wholesome bread and cheese,"
5548,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To dress their soups and fricassees;
5549,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"And, for our home-bred British cheer,"
5550,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Botargo, catsup, and caviare."
5551,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"This bloated harpy, sprung from hell,"
5552,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Confined thee, goddess, to a cell:"
5553,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Sprung from her womb that impious line,"
5554,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Contemners of thy rites divine.
5555,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"First, lolling Sloth, in woollen cap,"
5556,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Taking her after-dinner nap:
5557,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Pale Dropsy, with a sallow face,"
5558,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Her belly burst, and slow her pace:"
5559,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"And lordly Gout, wrapt up in fur,"
5560,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"And wheezing Asthma, loth to stir:"
5561,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Voluptuous Ease, the child of wealth,"
5562,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Infecting thus our hearts by stealth.
5563,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"None seek thee now in open air,"
5564,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To thee no verdant altars rear;
5565,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"But, in their cells and vaults obscene,"
5566,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Present a sacrifice unclean;
5567,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"From whence unsavoury vapours rose,"
5568,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Offensive to thy nicer nose.
5569,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Ah! who, in our degenerate days,"
5570,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"As nature prompts, his offering pays?"
5571,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Here nature never difference made
5572,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Between the sceptre and the spade.
5573,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Ye great ones, why will ye disdain"
5574,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,To pay your tribute on the plain?
5575,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Why will you place in lazy pride
5576,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Your altars near your couches' side:
5577,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,When from the homeliest earthen ware
5578,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Are sent up offerings more sincere,"
5579,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Than where the haughty duchess locks
5580,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Her silver vase in cedar box?
5581,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Yet some devotion still remains
5582,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Among our harmless northern swains,"
5583,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,"Whose offerings, placed in golden ranks,"
5584,A PANEGYRIC ON THE DEAN,Adorn our crystal rivers' banks;

6767,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"""About three months ago, at Windsor, a poor knight's widow was buried in"
6768,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"the cloisters. In digging the grave, the sexton struck against a small"
6769,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"leaden coffer, about half a foot in length, and four inches wide. The"
6770,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"poor man, expecting he had discovered a treasure, opened it with some"
6771,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"difficulty; but found only a small parchment, rolled up very fast, put"
6772,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"into a leather case; which case was tied at the top, and sealed with St."
6773,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"George, the impression on black wax, very rude and gothic. The parchment"
6774,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"was carried to a gentleman of learning, who found in it the following"
6775,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"lines, written in a black old English letter, and in the orthography of"
6776,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"the age, which seems to be about two hundred years ago. I made a shift to"
6777,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"obtain a copy of it; but the transcriber, I find, hath in many parts"
6778,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"altered the spelling to the modern way. The original, as I am informed,"
6779,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"is now in the hands of the ingenious Dr. Woodward, F. R. S. where, I"

6785,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"can judge better than I: however it be, several persons were of opinion"

6790,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"The subject of this virulent satire was Elizabeth, Baroness Percy,"
6791,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"daughter and heiress of Josceline, Earl of Northumberland, who died in"
6792,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"1670. She was born in 1666. In 1679 she was married to Henry Cavendish,"
6793,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"Earl of Ogle, who died in 1680. In 1681, she married Thomas Thynne, a man"
6794,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"of great wealth, a friend of the Duke of Monmouth and the Issachar of"
6795,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"Dryden's ""Absalom and Achitophel."" A few months afterwards, in February"
6796,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"1681-2, Thynne was assassinated in the Haymarket by foreigners, who were"
6797,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"devoted friends of Count Konigsmark, and appear to have acted under his"
6798,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],direction. The Count had been in London shortly before Lady Ogle's
6799,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"marriage to Thynne, and had then paid his addresses to her. He fled the"
6800,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"day after the murder, but was brought back, and was tried with the"
6801,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"principals as an accessory, but was acquitted. Four months after the"
6802,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"murder of Thynne, his widow was married to Charles Seymour, Duke of"
6803,THE WINDSOR PROPHECY[1],"Somerset, on 30th May, 1682, and ultimately became the favourite and"

8840,IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A WHIG AND A TORY,Since you can teach dead dogs to bite.
8841,IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A WHIG AND A TORY,WHIG. I proved my proposition full:

8843,IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A WHIG AND A TORY,"Now, let me tell you plainly, sir,"

8856,IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A WHIG AND A TORY,Then with his fore-foot set his mark.
8857,IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A WHIG AND A TORY,"TORY. Then all this while have I been bubbled,"
8858,IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A WHIG AND A TORY,I thought it was a dog in doublet:
8859,IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A WHIG AND A TORY,The matter now no longer sticks:
8860,IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A WHIG AND A TORY,For statesmen never want dog-tricks.
8861,IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A WHIG AND A TORY,"But since it was a real cur,"

8865,IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A WHIG AND A TORY,"WHIG. Yes, and a place he will grow rich in;"

8867,IN A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A WHIG AND A TORY,"Sir, to be plain, I tell you what,"

9472,AND ESQUIRE,
9473,AND ESQUIRE,"When foes are o'ercome, we preserve them from slaughter,"
9474,AND ESQUIRE,"To be hewers of wood, and drawers of water."
9475,AND ESQUIRE,"Now, although to draw water is not very good,"
9476,AND ESQUIRE,Yet we all should rejoice to be hewers of Wood.
9477,AND ESQUIRE,"I own it has often provoked me to mutter,"
9478,AND ESQUIRE,That a rogue so obscure should make such a clutter;
9479,AND ESQUIRE,"But ancient philosophers wisely remark,"
9480,AND ESQUIRE,That old rotten wood will shine in the dark.
9481,AND ESQUIRE,"The Heathens, we read, had gods made of wood,"
9482,AND ESQUIRE,"Who could do them no harm, if they did them no good;"
9483,AND ESQUIRE,"But this idol Wood may do us great evil,"
9484,AND ESQUIRE,"Their gods were of wood, but our Wood is the devil."
9485,AND ESQUIRE,To cut down fine wood is a very bad thing;
9486,AND ESQUIRE,And yet we all know much gold it will bring:
9487,AND ESQUIRE,"Then, if cutting down wood brings money good store"
9488,AND ESQUIRE,"Our money to keep, let us cut down one more."
9489,AND ESQUIRE,Now hear an old tale. There anciently stood
9490,AND ESQUIRE,(I forget in what church) an image of wood;
9491,AND ESQUIRE,"Concerning this image, there went a prediction,"
9492,AND ESQUIRE,It would burn a whole forest; nor was it a fiction.
9493,AND ESQUIRE,"'Twas cut into fagots and put to the flame,"
9494,AND ESQUIRE,"To burn an old friar, one Forest by name,"
9495,AND ESQUIRE,"My tale is a wise one, if well understood:"
9496,AND ESQUIRE,Find you but the Friar; and I'll find the Wood.
9497,AND ESQUIRE,"I hear, among scholars there is a great doubt,"
9498,AND ESQUIRE,"From what kind of tree this Wood was hewn out,"
9499,AND ESQUIRE,Teague made a good pun by a brogue in his speech:
9500,AND ESQUIRE,"And said, ""By my shoul, he's the son of a BEECH."""
9501,AND ESQUIRE,"Some call him a thorn, the curse of the nation,"
9502,AND ESQUIRE,As thorns were design'd to be from the creation.
9503,AND ESQUIRE,"Some think him cut out from the poisonous yew,"
9504,AND ESQUIRE,Beneath whose ill shade no plant ever grew.
9505,AND ESQUIRE,"Some say he's a birch, a thought very odd;"
9506,AND ESQUIRE,For none but a dunce would come under his rod.
9507,AND ESQUIRE,But I'll tell the secret; and pray do not blab:
9508,AND ESQUIRE,"He is an old stump, cut out of a crab;"
9509,AND ESQUIRE,"And England has put this crab to a hard use,"
9510,AND ESQUIRE,"To cudgel our bones, and for drink give us ver-juice;"
9511,AND ESQUIRE,"And therefore his witnesses justly may boast,"
9512,AND ESQUIRE,"That none are more properly knights of the post,"
9513,AND ESQUIRE,"But here Mr. Wood complains that we mock,"
9514,AND ESQUIRE,"Though he may be a blockhead, he's no real block."
9515,AND ESQUIRE,"He can eat, drink, and sleep; now and then for a friend"
9516,AND ESQUIRE,He'll not be too proud an old kettle to mend;
9517,AND ESQUIRE,"He can lie like a courtier, and think it no scorn,"
9518,AND ESQUIRE,"When gold's to be got, to forswear and suborn."
9519,AND ESQUIRE,"He can rap his own raps[1] and has the true sapience,"
9520,AND ESQUIRE,To turn a good penny to twenty bad halfpence.
9521,AND ESQUIRE,"Then in spite of your sophistry, honest Will Wood"
9522,AND ESQUIRE,"Is a man of this world, all true flesh and blood;"
9523,AND ESQUIRE,"So you are but in jest, and you will not, I hope,"
9524,AND ESQUIRE,Unman the poor knave for the sake of a trope.
9525,AND ESQUIRE,"'Tis a metaphor known to every plain thinker,"
9526,AND ESQUIRE,"Just as when we say, the devil's a tinker,"
9527,AND ESQUIRE,"Which cannot, in literal sense be made good,"
9528,AND ESQUIRE,Unless by the devil we mean Mr. Wood.
9529,AND ESQUIRE,"But some will object that the devil oft spoke,"
9530,AND ESQUIRE,"In heathenish times, from the trunk of an oak;"
9531,AND ESQUIRE,And since we must grant there never were known
9532,AND ESQUIRE,"More heathenish times, than those of our own;"
9533,AND ESQUIRE,"Perhaps you will say, 'tis the devil that puts"
9534,AND ESQUIRE,"The words in Wood's mouth, or speaks from his guts:"
9535,AND ESQUIRE,And then your old arguments still will return;
9536,AND ESQUIRE,"Howe'er, let us try him, and see how he'll burn:"
9537,AND ESQUIRE,"You'll pardon me, sir, your cunning I smoke,"
9538,AND ESQUIRE,"But Wood, I assure you, is no heart of oak;"
9539,AND ESQUIRE,"And, instead of the devil, this son of perdition"
9540,AND ESQUIRE,Hath join'd with himself two hags in commission.
9541,AND ESQUIRE,I ne'er could endure my talent to smother:
9542,AND ESQUIRE,"I told you one tale, and I'll tell you another."
9543,AND ESQUIRE,"A joiner to fasten a saint in a niche,"
9544,AND ESQUIRE,Bored a large auger-hole in the image's breech;
9545,AND ESQUIRE,"But, finding the statue to make no complaint,"
9546,AND ESQUIRE,He would ne'er be convinced it was a true saint.
9547,AND ESQUIRE,"When the true Wood arrives, as he soon will, no doubt,"
9548,AND ESQUIRE,(For that's but a sham Wood they carry about;[2])
9549,AND ESQUIRE,What stuff he is made of you quickly may find
9550,AND ESQUIRE,If you make the same trial and bore him behind.
9551,AND ESQUIRE,"I'll hold you a groat, when you wimble his bum,"
9552,AND ESQUIRE,He'll bellow as loud as the de'il in a drum.
9553,AND ESQUIRE,"From me, I declare you shall have no denial;"
9554,AND ESQUIRE,And there can be no harm in making a trial:
9555,AND ESQUIRE,"And when to the joy of your hearts he has roar'd,"
9556,AND ESQUIRE,You may show him about for a new groaning board.
9557,AND ESQUIRE,Now ask me a question. How came it to pass
9558,AND ESQUIRE,Wood got so much copper? He got it by brass;
9559,AND ESQUIRE,"This brass was a dragon, (observe what I tell ye,)"
9560,AND ESQUIRE,This dragon had gotten two sows in his belly;
9561,AND ESQUIRE,I know you will say this is all heathen Greek.
9562,AND ESQUIRE,"I own it, and therefore I leave you to seek."
9563,AND ESQUIRE,"I often have seen two plays very good,"
9564,AND ESQUIRE,"Call'd Love in a Tub, and Love in a Wood;"
9565,AND ESQUIRE,These comedies twain friend Wood will contrive
9566,AND ESQUIRE,On the scene of this land very soon to revive.
9567,AND ESQUIRE,"First, Love in a Tub: Squire Wood has in store"
9568,AND ESQUIRE,"Strong tubs for his raps, two thousand and more;"
9569,AND ESQUIRE,"These raps he will honestly dig out with shovels,"
9570,AND ESQUIRE,"And sell them for gold, or he can't show his love else."
9571,AND ESQUIRE,"Wood swears he will do it for Ireland's good,"
9572,AND ESQUIRE,Then can you deny it is Love in a Wood?
9573,AND ESQUIRE,"However, if critics find fault with the phrase,"
9574,AND ESQUIRE,I hope you will own it is Love in a Maze:
9575,AND ESQUIRE,"For when to express a friend's love you are willing,"
9576,AND ESQUIRE,We never say more than your love is a million;
9577,AND ESQUIRE,"But with honest Wood's love there is no contending,"
9578,AND ESQUIRE,'Tis fifty round millions of love and a mending.
9579,AND ESQUIRE,Then in his first love why should he be crost?
9580,AND ESQUIRE,I hope he will find that no love is lost.
9581,AND ESQUIRE,"Hear one story more, and then I will stop."
9582,AND ESQUIRE,I dreamt Wood was told he should die by a drop:
9583,AND ESQUIRE,"So methought he resolved no liquor to taste,"
9584,AND ESQUIRE,For fear the first drop might as well be his last.
9585,AND ESQUIRE,But dreams are like oracles; 'tis hard to explain 'em;
9586,AND ESQUIRE,For it proved that he died of a drop at Kilmainham.[3]
9587,AND ESQUIRE,"I waked with delight; and not without hope,"
9588,AND ESQUIRE,Very soon to see Wood drop down from a rope.
9589,AND ESQUIRE,"How he, and how we at each other should grin!"
9590,AND ESQUIRE,'Tis kindness to hold a friend up by the chin.
9591,AND ESQUIRE,"But soft! says the herald, I cannot agree;"
9592,AND ESQUIRE,For metal on metal is false heraldry.
9593,AND ESQUIRE,"Why that may be true; yet Wood upon Wood,"
9594,AND ESQUIRE,"I'll maintain with my life, is heraldry good."

10216,_M_.,"Punch comes like you, and lets a fart."
10217,_M_.,"There's not a puppet made of wood,"

10243,_M_.,They would consent that all the crew
10244,_M_.,Were hang'd before they'd part with you.
10245,_M_.,"But tell me, Tim, upon the spot,"
10246,_M_.,By all this toil what hast thou got?

10249,_M_.,"_T_. Got? D--n my blood! I frank my letters,"

10662,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Say, Robin, what can Traulus[2] mean"
10663,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],By bellowing thus against the Dean?
10664,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Why does he call him paltry scribbler,"
10665,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Papist, and Jacobite, and libeller,"
10666,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Yet cannot prove a single fact?
10667,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],
10668,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"_Robin_. Forgive him, Tom: his head is crackt."
10669,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],
10670,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"_T_. What mischief can the Dean have done him,"
10671,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],That Traulus calls for vengeance on him?
10672,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Why must he sputter, spawl, and slaver it"
10673,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],In vain against the people's favourite?
10674,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Revile that nation-saving paper,"
10675,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Which gave the Dean the name of Drapier?
10676,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],
10677,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"_R_. Why, Tom, I think the case is plain;"
10678,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Party and spleen have turn'd his brain.
10679,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],
10680,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"_T_. Such friendship never man profess'd,"
10681,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],The Dean was never so caress'd;
10682,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"For Traulus long his rancour nursed,"
10683,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Till, God knows why, at last it burst."
10684,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"That clumsy outside of a porter,"
10685,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],How could it thus conceal a courtier?
10686,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],
10687,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"_R_. I own, appearances are bad;"
10688,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Yet still insist the man is mad.
10689,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],

10691,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],How to distinguish friends from foes;
10692,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],And though perhaps among the rout
10693,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"He wildly flings his filth about,"
10694,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"He still has gratitude and sap'ence,"
10695,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],To spare the folks that give him ha'pence;
10696,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Nor in their eyes at random pisses,"
10697,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"But turns aside, like mad Ulysses;"
10698,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],While Traulus all his ordure scatters
10699,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],To foul the man he chiefly flatters.
10700,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Whence comes these inconsistent fits?
10701,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],
10702,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"_R_. Why, Tom, the man has lost his wits."

10705,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"At people's heels, with frothy chaps,"
10706,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Hangs down his head, and drops his tail,"
10707,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],To say he's mad will not avail;
10708,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"The neighbours all cry, ""Shoot him dead,"
10709,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Hang, drown, or knock him on the head."""
10710,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"So Traulus, when he first harangued,"
10711,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],I wonder why he was not hang'd;
10712,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"For of the two, without dispute,"
10713,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Towzer's the less offensive brute.
10714,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],
10715,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"_R_, Tom, you mistake the matter quite;"
10716,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Your barking curs will seldom bite
10717,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"And though you hear him stut-tut-tut-ter,"
10718,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],He barks as fast as he can utter.
10719,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"He prates in spite of all impediment,"
10720,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],While none believes that what he said he meant;
10721,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Puts in his finger and his thumb
10722,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"To grope for words, and out they come."
10723,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"He calls you rogue; there's nothing in it,"
10724,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],He fawns upon you in a minute:
10725,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"""Begs leave to rail, but, d--n his blood!"
10726,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],He only meant it for your good:
10727,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"His friendship was exactly timed,"
10728,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],He shot before your foes were primed:
10729,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"By this contrivance, Mr. Dean,"
10730,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"By G--! I'll bring you off as clean--""[3]"
10731,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Then let him use you e'er so rough,"
10732,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"""'Twas all for love,"" and that's enough."
10733,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"But, though he sputter through a session,"
10734,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],It never makes the least impression:
10735,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Whate'er he speaks for madness goes,"
10736,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],With no effect on friends or foes.
10737,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],
10738,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],_T_. The scrubbiest cur in all the pack
10739,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Can set the mastiff on your back.
10740,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"I own, his madness is a jest,"
10741,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],If that were all. But he's possest
10742,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Incarnate with a thousand imps,"
10743,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],To work whose ends his madness pimps;
10744,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Who o'er each string and wire preside,"
10745,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Fill every pipe, each motion guide;"
10746,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Directing every vice we find
10747,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],In Scripture to the devil assign'd;
10748,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Sent from the dark infernal region,"
10749,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"In him they lodge, and make him legion."
10750,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Of brethren he's a false accuser;
10751,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"A slanderer, traitor, and seducer;"
10752,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"A fawning, base, trepanning liar;"
10753,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],The marks peculiar of his sire.
10754,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Or, grant him but a drone at best;"
10755,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],A drone can raise a hornet's nest.
10756,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],The Dean had felt their stings before;
10757,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],And must their malice ne'er give o'er?
10758,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Still swarm and buzz about his nose?
10759,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],But Ireland's friends ne'er wanted foes.
10760,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"A patriot is a dangerous post,"
10761,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],When wanted by his country most;
10762,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Perversely comes in evil times,"
10763,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Where virtues are imputed crimes.
10764,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"His guilt is clear, the proofs are pregnant;"
10765,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],A traitor to the vices regnant.
10766,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"What spirit, since the world began,"
10767,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Could always bear to strive with man?
10768,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],"Which God pronounced he never would,"
10769,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],And soon convinced them by a flood.
10770,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],Yet still the Dean on freedom raves;
10771,A DIALOGUE BETWEEN TOM AND ROBIN[1],His spirit always strives with slaves.

13962,"SIR,",Your Billingsgate Muse methinks does begin
13963,"SIR,",With much greater noise than a conjugal din.
13964,"SIR,","A pox of her bawling, her _tempora et mores!_"
13965,"SIR,",What are times now to me; a'nt I one of the Tories?
13966,"SIR,",You tell me my verses disturb you at prayers;
13967,"SIR,","Oh, oh, Mr. Dean, are you there with your bears?"
13968,"SIR,","You pray, I suppose, like a Heathen, to Phoebus,"
13969,"SIR,",To give his assistance to make out my rebus:
13970,"SIR,",Which I don't think so fair; leave it off for the future;
13971,"SIR,","When the combat is equal, this God should be neuter."
13972,"SIR,","I'm now at the tavern, where I drink all I can,"
13973,"SIR,",To write with more spirit; I'll drink no more Helicon;
13974,"SIR,","For Helicon is water, and water is weak;"
13975,"SIR,","'Tis wine on the gross lee, that makes your Muse speak."
13976,"SIR,",This I know by her spirit and life; but I think
13977,"SIR,",She's much in the wrong to scold in her drink.
13978,"SIR,",Her damn'd pointed tongue pierced almost to my heart;
13979,"SIR,","Tell me of a cart,--tell me of a ----,"
13980,"SIR,","I'd have you to tell on both sides her ears,"
13981,"SIR,","If she comes to my house, that I'll kick her down stairs:"
13982,"SIR,","Then home she shall limping go, squalling out, O my knee;"
13983,"SIR,",You shall soon have a crutch to buy for your Melpomene.
13984,"SIR,","You may come as her bully, to bluster and swagger;"
13985,"SIR,","But my ink is my poison, my pen is my dagger:"
13986,"SIR,","Stand off, I desire, and mark what I say to you,"
13987,"SIR,",If you come I will make your Apollo shine through you.
13988,"SIR,","Don't think, sir, I fear a Dean, as I would fear a dun;"
13989,"SIR,","Which is all at present from yours,"

14000,"SIR,","Lord, said I, who's that parson, how awkwardly dangles he!"
14001,"SIR,","When whip you trot up, without minding your betters,"
14002,"SIR,","To the very coach side, and threaten your letters."
14003,"SIR,","Is the poison [and dagger] you boast in your jaws, trow?"
14004,"SIR,",Are you still in your cart with _convitia ex plaustro_?
14005,"SIR,","But to scold is your trade, which I soon should be foil'd in,"
14006,"SIR,",For scolding is just _quasi diceres_--school-din:
14007,"SIR,","And I think I may say, you could many good shillings get,"
14008,"SIR,","Were you drest like a bawd, and sold oysters at Billingsgate;"
14009,"SIR,","But coach it or cart it, I'd have you know, sirrah,"
14010,"SIR,","I'll write, though I'm forced to write in a wheelbarrow;"
14011,"SIR,","Nay, hector and swagger, you'll still find me stanch,"
14012,"SIR,",And you and your cart shall give me _carte blanche_.
14013,"SIR,","Since you write in a cart, keep it _tecta et sarta_,"
14014,"SIR,",'Tis all you have for it; 'tis your best Magna Carta;
14015,"SIR,","And I love you so well, as I told you long ago,"
14016,"SIR,",That I'll ne'er give my vote for _Delenda Cart-ago_.
14017,"SIR,","Now you write from your cellar, I find out your art,"

14021,"SIR,","To my goddess Melpomene, pride of her sex,"
14022,"SIR,","I gave, as you beg, your most humble respects:"
14023,"SIR,","The rest of your compliment I dare not tell her,"
14024,"SIR,",For she never descends so low as the cellar;
14025,"SIR,","But before you can put yourself under her banners,"
14026,"SIR,",She declares from her throne you must learn better manners.
14027,"SIR,","If once in your cellar my Phoebus should shine,"
14028,"SIR,",I tell you I'd not give a fig for your wine;
14029,"SIR,","So I'll leave him behind, for I certainly know it,"
14030,"SIR,","What he ripens above ground, he sours below it."
14031,"SIR,","But why should we fight thus, my partner so dear"
14032,"SIR,",With three hundred and sixty-five poems a-year?
14033,"SIR,","Let's quarrel no longer, since Dan and George Rochfort"
14034,"SIR,",Will laugh in their sleeves: I can tell you they watch for't.
14035,"SIR,","Then George will rejoice, and Dan will sing highday:"

14379,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,"acted by his head class, just before they entered the university; and,"
14380,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,"accordingly, in the year 1720, the Doctor having fixed on Hippolytus,"
14381,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,"writ a prologue in English, to be spoken by Master Thom. Putland, one of"
14382,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,the youngest children he had in his school. The prologue was very neat
14383,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,"and elegant, but extremely puerile, and quite adapted to the childhood of"
14384,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,"the speaker, who as regularly was taught and rehearsed his part as any of"
14385,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,"the upper lads did theirs. However, it unfortunately happened that Dr."
14386,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,"King, Archbishop of Dublin, had promised Sheridan that he would go and"
14387,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,see his lads perform the tragedy. Upon which Dr. Helsham writ another
14388,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,"prologue, wherein he laughed egregiously at Sheridan's; and privately"
14389,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,instructed Master Putland how to act his part; and at the same time
14390,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,"exacted a promise from the child, that no consideration should make him"
14391,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,repeat that prologue which he had been taught by Sheridan. When the play
14392,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,"was to be acted, the archbishop attended according to his promise; and"
14393,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,"Master Putland began Helsham's prologue, and went through it to the"
14394,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,amazement of Sheridan; which fired him to such a degree (although he was
14395,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,one of the best-natured men in the world) that he would have entirely put
14396,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,"off the play, had it not been in respect to the archbishop, who was"
14397,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,indeed highly complimented in Helsham's performance. When the play was

14399,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,"all the entreaties of the archbishop, the child's father, and Sheridan,"
14400,GEORGE-NIM-DAN-DEAN.,"could not prevail with Master Putland to repeat it, having, he said,"
