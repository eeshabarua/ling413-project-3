37,PREFACE,PREFACE
38,PREFACE,
39,PREFACE,
40,PREFACE,IT is with some diffidence that I sit down at an age so mature that I
41,PREFACE,"cannot bring myself to name it, to write a preface to works I printed and"
42,PREFACE,published at twelve.
43,PREFACE,
44,PREFACE,I would have the reader see a little boy living in a châlet on a Swiss
45,PREFACE,"mountain-side, overlooking a straggling village named Davos-Platz, where"
46,PREFACE,consumptives coming to get well more often died.  It was winter; the
47,PREFACE,sky-line was broken by frosty peaks; the hamlet—it was scarcely more
48,PREFACE,"then—lay huddled in the universal snow.  Morning came late, and the sun"
49,PREFACE,"set early.  A still, silent and icy night had an undue share of the round"
50,PREFACE,"of hours, which at least it had the grace to mitigate by a myriad of"
51,PREFACE,shining stars.
52,PREFACE,
53,PREFACE,The little boy thought it was a very jolly place.  He loved the
54,PREFACE,"tobogganing, the skating, the snow-balling; loved the crisp, tingling"
55,PREFACE,"air, and the woods full of Christmas trees, glittering with icicles.  Nor"
56,PREFACE,with his toy theatre and printing-press was the indoor confinement ever
57,PREFACE,irksome.  He but dimly appreciated that his stepfather and mother were
58,PREFACE,less happy in so favoured a spot.  His mother’s face was often anxious;
59,PREFACE,"sometimes he would find her crying.  His stepfather, whom he idolised,"
60,PREFACE,"was terribly thin, and even to childish eyes looked frail and spectral."
61,PREFACE,"The stepfather was an unsuccessful author named Robert Louis Stevenson,"
62,PREFACE,who would never have got along at all had it not been for his rich
63,PREFACE,parents in Edinburgh.  The little boy at his lessons in the room which
64,PREFACE,they all shared grew used to hearing a sentence that struck at his heart.
65,PREFACE,Perhaps it was the tone it was uttered in; perhaps the looks of
66,PREFACE,discouragement and depression that went with it.
67,PREFACE,
68,PREFACE,"‘Fanny, I shall have to write to my father.’"
69,PREFACE,
70,PREFACE,It served to make the little boy very precocious about money.  In a
71,PREFACE,family perennially short of it he learned its essentialness early.  He
72,PREFACE,"knew too, that he was a dreadfully expensive child.  His stepfather paid"
73,PREFACE,"forty pounds for his winter’s tutoring, not to speak of an additional"
74,PREFACE,outlay on a dying Prussian officer who taught him German with the aid of
75,PREFACE,a pocket-knife stuck down his throat to give him the right accent.  It
76,PREFACE,was with consternation that he once heard his stepfather say in a voice
77,PREFACE,"of tragedy: ‘Good Heavens, Fanny, we are spending ten pounds a week on"
78,PREFACE,food alone!’
79,PREFACE,
80,PREFACE,"The little boy, under the stress of this financial urgency, decided to go"
81,PREFACE,"into business, finding a capital opening in the Hotel Belvidere, where a"
82,PREFACE,hundred programmes were required weekly for the Saturday night concerts.
83,PREFACE,"A gentleman with a black beard, who was in charge of these arrangements,"
84,PREFACE,willingly offered to pay two francs fifty centimes for each set of
85,PREFACE,programmes.  The little boy was afraid of the gentleman with the black
86,PREFACE,"beard; he was a formidable gentleman, with a formidable manner, and he"
87,PREFACE,was very exacting about spelling.  The gentleman with the black beard
88,PREFACE,attached an inordinate importance to spelling.  The gentleman with the
89,PREFACE,black beard was wholly unable to make allowances for the trifling
90,PREFACE,mistakes that will occur in even the best-managed of printing-offices.
91,PREFACE,If the little boy printed: ‘’Twas in Trofolgar’s Bay . . . sung by Mr.
92,PREFACE,"Edwin Smith,’ the black-bearded gentleman had no mercy in sending that"
93,PREFACE,poor little boy back to do it all over again.  But he paid promptly—a
94,PREFACE,"severe man, but extremely honourable.  There were charity-bazaars too,"
95,PREFACE,"public invitations, announcements, letter-heads, all bringing grist to"
96,PREFACE,"the mill.  The ‘Elegy for Some Lead Soldiers’ was brought out, and sold"
97,PREFACE,for a penny.  Once there was a colossal order for a thousand lottery
98,PREFACE,tickets.
99,PREFACE,
100,PREFACE,The little boy’s ambitions soared.  He wrote and printed a tiny book of
101,PREFACE,"eight pages, entitled ‘Black Canyon, or Life in the Far West,’ in which"
102,PREFACE,he used all the ‘cuts’ he had somehow accumulated with his type—the story
103,PREFACE,conforming to the illustrations instead of the more common-place way of
104,PREFACE,the illustrations conforming to the text.  This work can occasionally be
105,PREFACE,"picked up at one of Sotheby’s auctions, and if you can get it for less"
106,PREFACE,than twenty-five pounds you are lucky—that is if you are a collector and
107,PREFACE,prize such things.  It has risen to the dignity of ‘DAVOS BOOKLETS;
108,PREFACE,"STEVENSONIANA; EXCESSIVELY RARE.’  But its original price was sixpence,"
109,PREFACE,and its sale was immediate and gratifying.  The little boy discovered
110,PREFACE,that there was much more money to be made from one book than a dozen sets
111,PREFACE,"of programmes, and that without any black-bearded gentleman either to"
112,PREFACE,tweak his nose when errors crept in.
113,PREFACE,
114,PREFACE,"Louis, as the little boy always called his stepfather, with a familiarity"
115,PREFACE,"that was much criticised by strangers, followed this publishing venture"
116,PREFACE,"with absorbing interest.  Then his own ambitions awakened, and one day,"
117,PREFACE,"with an affected humility that was most embarrassing, he called at the"
118,PREFACE,"office, and submitted a manuscript called, ‘Not I, and Other Poems,’"
119,PREFACE,which the firm of Osbourne and Co. gladly accepted on the spot.  It was
120,PREFACE,"an instantaneous hit, selling out an entire edition of fifty copies."
121,PREFACE,
122,PREFACE,"The publisher was thrilled, and the author was equally jubilant, saying"
123,PREFACE,"it was the only successful book he had ever written, and jingling his"
124,PREFACE,three francs of royalties with an air that made the little boy burst out
125,PREFACE,laughing with delighted pride.  In the ensuing enthusiasm another book
126,PREFACE,"was planned, and the first poem for it written."
127,PREFACE,
128,PREFACE,"‘If only we could have illustrations,’ said the publisher longingly.  But"
129,PREFACE,"his ‘cuts’ had all been used in ‘Black Canyon, or Life in the Far West.’"
130,PREFACE,"Illustrations had to be put by as a dream impossible of fulfilment.  No,"
131,PREFACE,"not impossible!  Louis, who was a man of infinite resourcefulness (he"
132,PREFACE,"could paint better theatre-scenes than any one could buy), said that he"
133,PREFACE,would try to carve some pictures on squares of fretwood.  The word
134,PREFACE,fretwood seems as unknown nowadays as the thing itself; it was an
135,PREFACE,extremely thin piece of board with which one was supposed to make works
136,PREFACE,"of art with the help of pasted-on patterns, an aggravating little saw,"
137,PREFACE,"and the patience of Job. . . .  Well, Louis cut out a small square of"
138,PREFACE,"fretwood, and in a deeply-thoughtful manner applied himself to the task."
139,PREFACE,He had only a pocket-knife; real tools came later; but he was impelled by
140,PREFACE,a will to win that carried all before it.  After an afternoon of almost
141,PREFACE,suffocating excitement—for the publisher—he completed the engraving that
142,PREFACE,"accompanies the poem: ‘Reader, your soul upraise to see.’  But it had yet"
143,PREFACE,to be mounted on a wooden block in order to raise it to the exact level
144,PREFACE,of the type.  At last this was done.  A proof was run off.  But the
145,PREFACE,"impression was unequal.  Oh, the disappointment!  Author and publisher"
146,PREFACE,gazed at each other in misery.  But woman’s wit came to the rescue.  Why
147,PREFACE,"not build it up with cigarette papers?  ‘Bravo, Fanny!’  The author set"
148,PREFACE,"to work, deftly and skilfully.  Then more proofs, more cigarette-papers,"
149,PREFACE,"more running up and down stairs to the little boy’s room, which in"
150,PREFACE,temperature hovered about zero.  But what was temperature?  The thing was
151,PREFACE,"a success.  The little boy, entranced beyond measure, printed copy after"
152,PREFACE,copy from the sheer pleasure of seeing the wet ink magically reproducing
153,PREFACE,the block.
154,PREFACE,
155,PREFACE,The next day the little boy was sent to a dying Swiss—half the population
156,PREFACE,of Davos were coughing away the remnants of life—who lived with his
157,PREFACE,"poverty-stricken family in one room, earning their bread by carving"
158,PREFACE,bears.  A model block was shown him.  Could he reproduce a dozen exactly
159,PREFACE,"like it, but in a wood without any grain?  The dying Swiss said he could,"
160,PREFACE,"leaving his bear forthwith, and applying himself to the task.  The"
161,PREFACE,"pinched-face children looked on amazed; the little print of ‘Reader, your"
162,PREFACE,soul upraise to see’ was passed from hand to hand with exclamations of
163,PREFACE,"astonishment.  The dying Swiss gave the little boy the blocks,"
164,PREFACE,beautifully and faultlessly finished.  Would the little boy care to buy a
165,PREFACE,"bear?  No, the little boy didn’t.  He scurried home through the snow with"
166,PREFACE,the precious blocks.
167,PREFACE,
168,PREFACE,"Thus ‘Moral Emblems’ came out; ninety copies, price sixpence.  Its"
169,PREFACE,reception might almost be called sensational.  Wealthy people in the
170,PREFACE,Hotel Belvidere bought as many as three copies apiece.  Friends in
171,PREFACE,England wrote back for more.  Meanwhile the splendid artist was
172,PREFACE,"assiduously busy.  He worked like a beaver, saying that it was the best"
173,PREFACE,relaxation he had ever found.  The little boy once overheard him
174,PREFACE,confiding to a visitor: ‘I cannot tell you what a Godsend these silly
175,PREFACE,"blocks have been to me.  When I can write no more, and read no more, and"
176,PREFACE,"think no more, I can pass whole hours engraving these blocks in blissful"
177,PREFACE,"contentment.’  These may not have been the actual words, but such at"
178,PREFACE,least was their sense.
179,PREFACE,
180,PREFACE,"Thus the second ‘Moral Emblems’ came out; ninety copies, price ninepence."
181,PREFACE,"The public welcomed it as heartily as the first, the little boy becoming"
182,PREFACE,so prosperous that he accumulated upwards of five pounds.  But let it
183,PREFACE,never be said that he spurned the humble mainstay of his beginnings.  He
184,PREFACE,"printed the weekly programmes as usual, and bore the exactions of the"
185,PREFACE,black-bearded gentleman with fortitude.  When he made such a trifling
186,PREFACE,"mistake, for instance, as ‘The Harp that Once Through Tara’s Hells,’ he"
187,PREFACE,"dutifully climbed the hill to his freezing room, and ran off a whole"
188,PREFACE,fresh set.  Two francs fifty was two francs fifty. Every business man
189,PREFACE,appreciates the comfort of a small regular order which can be counted on
190,PREFACE,like the clock.
191,PREFACE,
192,PREFACE,"But one day there was no black-bearded gentleman.  ‘Oh, he was dead.  Had"
193,PREFACE,had a hemorrhage three days before and had died.’  I don’t know whether
194,PREFACE,"the little boy mourned for him particularly, but it was a shock to lose"
195,PREFACE,that two francs fifty centimes.  The little boy was worried until he
196,PREFACE,found a lady who had substituted herself for the gentleman with the black
197,PREFACE,"beard.  She was a very kind lady; you could print anything for that lady,"
198,PREFACE,and ‘get away with it’ as Americans say.  But she was frolicsome and
199,PREFACE,"lacked poise; she was vague about appointments, and had a disheartening"
200,PREFACE,"way of saying: ‘Oh, bother,’ when the little boy appeared; she would"
201,PREFACE,insist on kissing him amid circumstances of the most odious publicity;
202,PREFACE,"was so abased a creature besides, that she often marred the programmes by"
203,PREFACE,"making pen-and-ink corrections.  In contrast, the little boy looked back"
204,PREFACE,on the black-bearded gentleman almost with regret.
205,PREFACE,
206,PREFACE,"Two winters were thus occupied, with incidental education that seemed far"
207,PREFACE,"less important.  The Prussian officer had fortunately died, releasing the"
208,PREFACE,little boy from any further study of German.  All that he retains of it
209,PREFACE,"to-day is the taste of that pocket-knife, and of the Prussian officer’s"
210,PREFACE,"thumb.  Then he was sent to boarding-school in England, or to be precise"
211,PREFACE,to a tutor who had half a dozen resident pupils.  Time passed; publishing
212,PREFACE,"became a memory.  Then a long summer holiday found the little boy, now"
213,PREFACE,"much grown and matured, reunited with his family in Kingussie.  The"
214,PREFACE,"printing-press was there, and business was resumed with enthusiasm.  The"
215,PREFACE,"stepfather, who had made much more progress with engraving than the boy"
216,PREFACE,"had with Latin, had the blocks and poems all ready for ‘The Graver and"
217,PREFACE,the Pen.’
218,PREFACE,
219,PREFACE,But the printing-press broke down; and after an interval of despair and
220,PREFACE,"unavailing attempts to repair it, an amiable old man was found who had a"
221,PREFACE,press of his own behind a microscopic general shop.  Here ‘The Graver and
222,PREFACE,the Pen’ was printed with what now seems an almost regrettable
223,PREFACE,perfection.  The amiable old man was altogether too amiable.  He would
224,PREFACE,"insist on doing far too much himself, though he had been merely paid a"
225,PREFACE,trifling rent for the use of the press.  An edition of a hundred copies
226,PREFACE,"was printed, of which almost none were sold.  The little boy had grown"
227,PREFACE,such a big boy that he was ashamed of tradesmanship.  He had passed the
228,PREFACE,age when he could take sixpences and ninepences with ease from strangers.
229,PREFACE,"New standards were imperceptibly forming, and it pleased him better to"
230,PREFACE,see his stepfather give away ‘The Graver and the Pen’ to those worthy of
231,PREFACE,so signal an honour.
232,PREFACE,
233,PREFACE,In fact ‘The Graver and the Pen’ was the last enterprise of Osbourne and
234,PREFACE,Co.  ‘The Pirate and the Apothecary’ was projected; three superb
235,PREFACE,illustrations were engraved for it; yet it never saw more light than the
236,PREFACE,typewriter afforded. ‘The Builder’s Doom’ has remained in manuscript
237,PREFACE,until the present time.  No illustrations were either drawn or engraved
238,PREFACE,"for it.  It marked the final decline of a once flourishing business,"
239,PREFACE,which in its day had given so much laughter to many people sadly in need
240,PREFACE,of it.

859,AND THE APOTHECARY,Proudly he treads the village green;
860,AND THE APOTHECARY,"And, free from pettiness and rancour,"
861,AND THE APOTHECARY,Takes lodgings at the ‘Crown and Anchor.’
862,AND THE APOTHECARY,
863,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Strange, when a man so great and good"
864,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Once more in his home-country stood,"
865,AND THE APOTHECARY,Strange that the sordid clowns should show
866,AND THE APOTHECARY,A dull desire to have him go.
867,AND THE APOTHECARY,
868,AND THE APOTHECARY,[Picture: The Pirate and the Apothecary: Scene the Second]
869,AND THE APOTHECARY,
870,AND THE APOTHECARY,"His clinging breeks, his tarry hat,"
871,AND THE APOTHECARY,"The way he swore, the way he spat,"
872,AND THE APOTHECARY,"A certain quality of manner,"
873,AND THE APOTHECARY,Alarming like the pirate’s banner—
874,AND THE APOTHECARY,Something that did not seem to suit all—
875,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Something, O call it bluff, not brutal—"
876,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Something at least, howe’er it’s called,"
877,AND THE APOTHECARY,Made Robin generally black-balled.
878,AND THE APOTHECARY,
879,AND THE APOTHECARY,"His soul was wounded; proud and glum,"
880,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Alone he sat and swigged his rum,"
881,AND THE APOTHECARY,And took a great distaste to men
882,AND THE APOTHECARY,Till he encountered Chemist Ben.
883,AND THE APOTHECARY,Bright was the hour and bright the day
884,AND THE APOTHECARY,That threw them in each other’s way;
885,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Glad were their mutual salutations,"
886,AND THE APOTHECARY,Long their respective revelations.
887,AND THE APOTHECARY,Before the inn in sultry weather
888,AND THE APOTHECARY,They talked of this and that together;
889,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Ben told the tale of his indentures,"
890,AND THE APOTHECARY,And Rob narrated his adventures.
891,AND THE APOTHECARY,
892,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Last, as the point of greatest weight,"
893,AND THE APOTHECARY,"The pair contrasted their estate,"
894,AND THE APOTHECARY,"And Robin, like a boastful sailor,"
895,AND THE APOTHECARY,Despised the other for a tailor.
896,AND THE APOTHECARY,
897,AND THE APOTHECARY,"‘See,’ he remarked, ‘with envy, see"
898,AND THE APOTHECARY,A man with such a fist as me!
899,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Bearded and ringed, and big, and brown,"
900,AND THE APOTHECARY,I sit and toss the stingo down.
901,AND THE APOTHECARY,Hear the gold jingle in my bag—
902,AND THE APOTHECARY,All won beneath the Jolly Flag!’
903,AND THE APOTHECARY,
904,AND THE APOTHECARY,Ben moralised and shook his head:
905,AND THE APOTHECARY,‘You wanderers earn and eat your bread.
906,AND THE APOTHECARY,"The foe is found, beats or is beaten,"
907,AND THE APOTHECARY,"And, either how, the wage is eaten."
908,AND THE APOTHECARY,And after all your pully-hauly
909,AND THE APOTHECARY,Your proceeds look uncommon small-ly.
910,AND THE APOTHECARY,You had done better here to tarry
911,AND THE APOTHECARY,Apprentice to the Apothecary.
912,AND THE APOTHECARY,The silent pirates of the shore
913,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Eat and sleep soft, and pocket more"
914,AND THE APOTHECARY,
915,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Than any red, robustious ranger"
916,AND THE APOTHECARY,Who picks his farthings hot from danger.
917,AND THE APOTHECARY,You clank your guineas on the board;
918,AND THE APOTHECARY,Mine are with several bankers stored.
919,AND THE APOTHECARY,"You reckon riches on your digits,"
920,AND THE APOTHECARY,"You dash in chase of Sals and Bridgets,"
921,AND THE APOTHECARY,"You drink and risk delirium tremens,"
922,AND THE APOTHECARY,Your whole estate a common seaman’s!
923,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Regard your friend and school companion,"
924,AND THE APOTHECARY,Soon to be wed to Miss Trevanion
925,AND THE APOTHECARY,"(Smooth, honourable, fat and flowery,"
926,AND THE APOTHECARY,"With Heaven knows how much land in dowry),"
927,AND THE APOTHECARY,Look at me—Am I in good case?
928,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Look at my hands, look at my face;"
929,AND THE APOTHECARY,Look at the cloth of my apparel;
930,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Try me and test me, lock and barrel;"
931,AND THE APOTHECARY,"And own, to give the devil his due,"
932,AND THE APOTHECARY,I have made more of life than you.
933,AND THE APOTHECARY,Yet I nor sought nor risked a life;
934,AND THE APOTHECARY,I shudder at an open knife;
935,AND THE APOTHECARY,The perilous seas I still avoided
936,AND THE APOTHECARY,And stuck to land whate’er betided.
937,AND THE APOTHECARY,"I had no gold, no marble quarry,"
938,AND THE APOTHECARY,"I was a poor apothecary,"
939,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Yet here I stand, at thirty-eight,"
940,AND THE APOTHECARY,A man of an assured estate.’
941,AND THE APOTHECARY,
942,AND THE APOTHECARY,"‘Well,’ answered Robin—‘well, and how?’"
943,AND THE APOTHECARY,
944,AND THE APOTHECARY,The smiling chemist tapped his brow.
945,AND THE APOTHECARY,"‘Rob,’ he replied, ‘this throbbing brain"
946,AND THE APOTHECARY,Still worked and hankered after gain.
947,AND THE APOTHECARY,"By day and night, to work my will,"
948,AND THE APOTHECARY,It pounded like a powder mill;
949,AND THE APOTHECARY,And marking how the world went round
950,AND THE APOTHECARY,A theory of theft it found.
951,AND THE APOTHECARY,Here is the key to right and wrong:
952,AND THE APOTHECARY,"_Steal little, but steal all day long_;"
953,AND THE APOTHECARY,And this invaluable plan
954,AND THE APOTHECARY,Marks what is called the Honest Man.
955,AND THE APOTHECARY,"When first I served with Doctor Pill,"
956,AND THE APOTHECARY,My hand was ever in the till.

959,AND THE APOTHECARY,
960,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Now that I am myself a master,"
961,AND THE APOTHECARY,My gains come softer still and faster.
962,AND THE APOTHECARY,"As thus: on Wednesday, a maid"
963,AND THE APOTHECARY,Came to me in the way of trade.
964,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Her mother, an old farmer’s wife,"
965,AND THE APOTHECARY,Required a drug to save her life.
966,AND THE APOTHECARY,"‘At once, my dear, at once,’ I said,"
967,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Patted the child upon the head,"
968,AND THE APOTHECARY,"Bade her be still a loving daughter,"
969,AND THE APOTHECARY,And filled the bottle up with water.’
970,AND THE APOTHECARY,
971,AND THE APOTHECARY,"‘Well, and the mother?’ Robin cried."
972,AND THE APOTHECARY,

992,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,THE BUILDER’S DOOM
993,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,
994,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,
995,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,In eighteen-twenty Deacon Thin
996,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Feu’d the land and fenced it in,"
997,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,And laid his broad foundations down
998,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,About a furlong out of town.
999,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,
1000,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Early and late the work went on.
1001,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,The carts were toiling ere the dawn;
1002,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"The mason whistled, the hodman sang;"
1003,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Early and late the trowels rang;
1004,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,And Thin himself came day by day
1005,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,To push the work in every way.
1006,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"An artful builder, patent king"
1007,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Of all the local building ring,"
1008,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Who was there like him in the quarter
1009,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"For mortifying brick and mortar,"
1010,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Or pocketing the odd piastre
1011,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,By substituting lath and plaster?
1012,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"With plan and two-foot rule in hand,"
1013,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"He by the foreman took his stand,"
1014,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"With boisterous voice, with eagle glance"
1015,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,To stamp upon extravagance.
1016,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"For thrift of bricks and greed of guilders,"
1017,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,He was the Buonaparte of Builders.
1018,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,
1019,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"The foreman, a desponding creature,"
1020,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Demurred to here and there a feature:
1021,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"‘For surely, sir—with your permeession—"
1022,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Bricks here, sir, in the main parteetion. . . . ’"
1023,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"The builder goggled, gulped, and stared,"
1024,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,The foreman’s services were spared.
1025,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Thin would not count among his minions
1026,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,A man of Wesleyan opinions.
1027,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,
1028,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"‘Money is money,’ so he said."
1029,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"‘Crescents are crescents, trade is trade."
1030,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Pharaohs and emperors in their seasons
1031,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Built, I believe, for different reasons—"
1032,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Charity, glory, piety, pride—"
1033,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"To pay the men, to please a bride,"
1034,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"To use their stone, to spite their neighbours,"
1035,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Not for a profit on their labours.
1036,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,
1037,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,They built to edify or bewilder;
1038,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,I build because I am a builder.
1039,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Crescent and street and square I build,"
1040,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Plaster and paint and carve and gild.
1041,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Around the city see them stand,"
1042,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"These triumphs of my shaping hand,"
1043,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"With bulging walls, with sinking floors,"
1044,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"With shut, impracticable doors,"
1045,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Fickle and frail in every part,"
1046,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,And rotten to their inmost heart.
1047,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,There shall the simple tenant find
1048,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Death in the falling window-blind,"
1049,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Death in the pipe, death in the faucet,"
1050,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Death in the deadly water-closet!
1051,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,A day is set for all to die:
1052,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,_Caveat emptor_! what care I?’
1053,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,
1054,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,As to Amphion’s tuneful kit
1055,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Thebes rose, with towers encircling it;"
1056,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,As to the Mage’s brandished wand
1057,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,A spiry palace clove the sand;
1058,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"To Thin’s indomitable financing,"
1059,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,That phantom crescent kept advancing.
1060,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,When first the brazen bells of churches
1061,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Called clerk and parson to their perches,"
1062,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,The worshippers of every sect
1063,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Already viewed it with respect;
1064,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,A second Sunday had not gone
1065,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Before the roof was rattled on:
1066,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"And when the fourth was there, behold"
1067,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"The crescent finished, painted, sold!"
1068,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,
1069,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"The stars proceeded in their courses,"
1070,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Nature with her subversive forces,"
1071,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Time, too, the iron-toothed and sinewed,"
1072,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,And the edacious years continued.
1073,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Thrones rose and fell; and still the crescent,"
1074,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Unsanative and now senescent,"
1075,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"A plastered skeleton of lath,"
1076,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Looked forward to a day of wrath.
1077,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"In the dead night, the groaning timber"
1078,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Would jar upon the ear of slumber,"
1079,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"And, like Dodona’s talking oak,"
1080,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Of oracles and judgments spoke.
1081,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,When to the music fingered well
1082,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"The feet of children lightly fell,"
1083,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"The sire, who dozed by the decanters,"
1084,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Started, and dreamed of misadventures."
1085,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,The rotten brick decayed to dust;
1086,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,The iron was consumed by rust;
1087,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Each tabid and perverted mansion
1088,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Hung in the article of declension.
1089,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,
1090,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"So forty, fifty, sixty passed;"
1091,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Until, when seventy came at last,"
1092,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,The occupant of number three
1093,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Called friends to hold a jubilee.
1094,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Wild was the night; the charging rack
1095,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Had forced the moon upon her back;
1096,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,The wind piped up a naval ditty;
1097,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,And the lamps winked through all the city.
1098,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Before that house, where lights were shining,"
1099,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Corpulent feeders, grossly dining,"
1100,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"And jolly clamour, hum and rattle,"
1101,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Fairly outvoiced the tempest’s battle.
1102,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"As still his moistened lip he fingered,"
1103,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,The envious policeman lingered;
1104,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"While far the infernal tempest sped,"
1105,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"And shook the country folks in bed,"
1106,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"And tore the trees and tossed the ships,"
1107,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,He lingered and he licked his lips.
1108,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Lo, from within, a hush! the host"
1109,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Briefly expressed the evening’s toast;
1110,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"And lo, before the lips were dry,"
1111,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,The Deacon rising to reply!
1112,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"‘Here in this house which once I built,"
1113,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Papered and painted, carved and gilt,"
1114,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"And out of which, to my content,"
1115,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,I netted seventy-five per cent.;
1116,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Here at this board of jolly neighbours,"
1117,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,I reap the credit of my labours.
1118,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,These were the days—I will say more—
1119,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,These were the grand old days of yore!
1120,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,The builder laboured day and night;
1121,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,He watched that every brick was right:
1122,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,
1123,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,The decent men their utmost did;
1124,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,And the house rose—a pyramid!
1125,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"These were the days, our provost knows,"
1126,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"When forty streets and crescents rose,"
1127,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"The fruits of my creative noddle,"
1128,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"All more or less upon a model,"
1129,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Neat and commodious, cheap and dry,"
1130,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,A perfect pleasure to the eye!
1131,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,I found this quite a country quarter;
1132,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,I leave it solid lath and mortar.
1133,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"In all, I was the single actor—"
1134,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,And am this city’s benefactor!
1135,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Since then, alas! both thing and name,"
1136,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Shoddy across the ocean came—
1137,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Shoddy that can the eye bewilder
1138,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,And makes me blush to meet a builder!
1139,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Had this good house, in frame or fixture,"
1140,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Been tempered by the least admixture
1141,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Of that discreditable shoddy,"
1142,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Should we to-day compound our toddy,"
1143,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Or gaily marry song and laughter
1144,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Below its sempiternal rafter?
1145,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Not so!’ the Deacon cried.
1146,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,
1147,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,The mansion
1148,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Had marked his fatuous expansion.
1149,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"The years were full, the house was fated,"
1150,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,The rotten structure crepitated!
1151,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,
1152,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"A moment, and the silent guests"
1153,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,Sat pallid as their dinner vests.
1154,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"A moment more and, root and branch,"
1155,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"That mansion fell in avalanche,"
1156,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Story on story, floor on floor,"
1157,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Roof, wall and window, joist and door,"
1158,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,"Dead weight of damnable disaster,"
1159,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,A cataclysm of lath and plaster.
1160,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,
1161,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,_Siloam did not choose a sinner_—
1162,THE BUILDER’S DOOM,_All were not builders at the dinner_.
