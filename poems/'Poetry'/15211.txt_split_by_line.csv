86,TO NEW YORK,"For maid and lad New York is fairy land,"
87,TO NEW YORK,Delightful charms in gorgeous brilliant lure!
88,TO NEW YORK,Our youth do struggle on ambition's tour.
89,TO NEW YORK,They meet life's challenge with true heart and hand.
90,TO NEW YORK,Forgotten trails are marked with scar and wand;
91,TO NEW YORK,A blasted rock and broken twigs assure
92,TO NEW YORK,"The traveler that others fought the moor,"
93,TO NEW YORK,"And sailed the stormy breakers, crossed the sand"
94,TO NEW YORK,To build the city on a granite slab.
95,TO NEW YORK,"They tamed the wilderness, a sturdy clan!"
96,TO NEW YORK,"Retracing paths recall the glory made,"
97,TO NEW YORK,Lays bare the secrets of the field and lab.
98,TO NEW YORK,Such tours give hope for future life and plan.
99,TO NEW YORK,Brave men have set the torch with ax and spade.

129,WINTER,In sheltered nooks snowbirds are singing hymns.
130,WINTER,"The sycamore shafts gleam and shine afar,"
131,WINTER,Down by the river where the black oaks are.
132,WINTER,The goldenrod now droops his fuzzy head;
133,WINTER,"There by my fence, leaves make a fluffy bed."
134,WINTER,They mulch my flower seed down in the loam;
135,WINTER,Beyond below the tall sedge grasses moan.
136,WINTER,"Seared grass curls firmly over tender sprigs,"
137,WINTER,And my rose bush there curves its brown thorned twigs.
138,WINTER,"Beneath my window, tulip bulbs lay snug,"
139,WINTER,Quite safe and warm in earthy winter rug.
140,WINTER,"All nature resting for a springtime gain,"
141,WINTER,And quiet gray tones soothe an inner pain.

151,DREAMING BY THE RIVER,Wind sighing gently
152,DREAMING BY THE RIVER,Whistling by with ease.
153,DREAMING BY THE RIVER,Cow-bells tinkling distant
154,DREAMING BY THE RIVER,"Farmer on the lea,"

167,WHEN YOU COME HOME,
168,WHEN YOU COME HOME,"O happy, happy heart, that can but leap"
169,WHEN YOU COME HOME,"For joy, when you return to me again;"
170,WHEN YOU COME HOME,"The love within grows fresh as morning glen,"
171,WHEN YOU COME HOME,Awakes and lights the gloom where shadows creep.
172,WHEN YOU COME HOME,--The night will come and with it women weep.
173,WHEN YOU COME HOME,"Stay, Dear, with me, for dark will come and then,"
174,WHEN YOU COME HOME,It fills the soul with fear--don't go again--
175,WHEN YOU COME HOME,"Black clouds will roll, when only children sleep."
176,WHEN YOU COME HOME,O Darling storms of midnight vex and threat;
177,WHEN YOU COME HOME,The gullies moan and then the goblins see!
178,WHEN YOU COME HOME,It is not wise or brave to prattle so;
179,WHEN YOU COME HOME,"And Dear, if you must go, I will not fret;"
180,WHEN YOU COME HOME,"The sun will shine when you come home to me,"
181,WHEN YOU COME HOME,Dark night is day and only mild winds blow.
182,WHEN YOU COME HOME,
