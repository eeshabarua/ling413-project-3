28,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"There lies a wold in Vester Haf,"
29,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,There builds a boor his hold;
30,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"And thither he carries hawk and hound,"
31,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,He'll stay through winter's cold.
32,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
33,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"He takes with him both hound and cock,"
34,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,He means there long to stay;
35,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,The wild deer in the wood that are
36,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,For his arrival pay.
37,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
38,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"He hews the oak and poplar tall,"
39,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,He fells the good beech tree;
40,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Then fill'd was the laidly Trold with spite
41,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,That he should make so free.
42,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
43,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"He hews him posts, he hews him balks,"
44,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,He early toils and late;
45,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Out spake the Trolds within the hill:
46,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Who knocks at such a rate?"""
47,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
48,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Then up and spake the youngest Trold,"
49,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,As emmet small to view:
50,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""O here is come a Christian man,"
51,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"But verily he shall rue."""
52,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
53,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Upstood the smallest of the Trolds,"
54,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,And round he roll'd his eyes:
55,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""O we will hie to the yeoman's house,"
56,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,And o'er him hold assize.
57,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
58,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""He hews away our sheltering wood,"
59,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Meanwhile shall we be tame?
60,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"No! I from him his wife will take,"
61,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"And make him suffer shame."""
62,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
63,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,All the Trolds in the hill that were
64,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Wild for the fray upbound;
65,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"They hie away to the yeoman's house,"
66,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Their tails all curling round.
67,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
68,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Seven and a hundred were the Trolds,"
69,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Their laidliness was great;
70,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"To the yeoman's house they'll go as guests,"
71,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,With him to drink and eat.
72,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
73,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"The hound is yelling in the yard,"
74,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,The herdsman blows his horn;
75,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Crows the cock and clucks the hen
76,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,As the yeoman throws them corn.
77,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
78,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Of Villenskov the yeoman saw
79,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,The Trolds the window through:
80,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Now help me Jesu, Mary's son,"
81,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Those trolds have me in view."""
82,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
83,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"He sign'd the cross in every nook,"
84,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,But mostly in his room;
85,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Some of the Trolds in fright thereat
86,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Flew to the forest's gloom.
87,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
88,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Some flew east, and some flew west,"
89,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,And some flew north away;
90,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"And others flew to the valleys deep,"
91,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Where still, I trow, they stay."
92,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
93,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,But ah! the smallest of the Trolds
94,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Bold enter'd at the door;
95,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"For crossing he refus'd to flee,"
96,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Was bent on mischief sore.
97,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
98,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"The housewife thought of a good device,"
99,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"She plac'd him at the board,"
100,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"And before him set both ale and meat,"
101,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,With many a courteous word.
102,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
103,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Hear, husbandman of Villenskov,"
104,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Attend to what I say;
105,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Who has to thee permission given
106,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,To build where I have sway?
107,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
108,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Since thou to build within my bounds"
109,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Hast ta'en the liberty,"
110,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Thou shalt to me thy housewife give,"
111,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"For I with her will lie."""
112,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
113,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Then answer made the hapless man,"
114,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,As God gave him the thought:
115,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Thou shalt not Ellen get from me,"
116,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Like her I value nought."""
117,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
118,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,He answer made unto the Trold:
119,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Let but my wife alone,"
120,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"And do thou take my money and goods,"
121,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"And keep them for thy own."""
122,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
123,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Then I will Ellen take, and thee,"
124,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,And tread ye both to gore;
125,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,And I will take thy silver and gold
126,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"And hide it 'neath my floor."""
127,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
128,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,The yeoman and his household all
129,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Were seized with mighty fright:
130,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Better that one of us be lost"
131,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Than all destroy'd outright."""
132,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
133,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Then up and stood the desp'rate man,"
134,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,With sore affliction rife;
135,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,And he has given his Ellen dear
136,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,To the young Trold for wife.
137,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
138,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Then wax'd he glad, and sprang about,"
139,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,So fondly her he pressed;
140,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"O then how pale her cheeks became,"
141,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,She was so sore distrest!
142,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
143,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Then out and spake the afflicted Dame
144,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Whilst shedding many a tear:
145,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""O God in mercy look on me,"
146,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,My fate is hard to bear.
147,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
148,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""I did possess as fair a man"
149,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"As ever walk'd-on mead,"
150,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,But now perforce with laidly Trold
151,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Must do adulterous deed."""
152,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
153,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"He kiss'd her once, he kiss'd her twice,"
154,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Her heart yet sadder grew;
155,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,The laidliest Devil he became
156,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,That man did ever view.
157,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
158,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,When the third time he her would kiss
159,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,She call'd on Mary's son;
160,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Then he became a lovely knight,"
161,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,His elfin shape was gone.
162,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
163,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,It happen'd neath a linden green
164,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,He was from woe releas'd;
165,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Then straightway fled all fear and dread,"
166,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,So well they all were pleas'd.
167,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
168,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Hear, thou beloved Ellenlile,"
169,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Consent my wife to be,"
170,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,And all the gold in England's isle
171,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,I will bestow on thee.
172,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
173,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""When I was little, Death from me"
174,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,My mother took away;
175,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"My step-dame drove me forth, and I"
176,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Became a Trold so gray.
177,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
178,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""I'll give thy husband gifts of price"
179,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,And titles fair beside;
180,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"In verity, thou yeoman's dame,"
181,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Thou wilt become my bride."""
182,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
183,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Thou noble knight, we'll thank the Lord"
184,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"From woe who set us free,"
185,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,If thou wilt wed some fair young maid
186,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"You both may live in glee."""
187,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
188,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""If thee I can't in marriage get"
189,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"I'll have thy daughter bright,"
190,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,And all thy benefits to me
191,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,By crowning her requite.
192,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
193,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Thanks, Ellen, thanks, thou woman wise,"
194,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,To praise thee I'll not cease;
195,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,If I may not thy love obtain
196,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"I'll leave thee here in peace."""
197,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
198,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Now builds the yeoman on his isle,"
199,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,And no one him offends;
200,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"His daughter bears old England's crown,"
201,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,And happy days she spends.
202,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
203,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Now Ellen has, the yeoman's wife,"
204,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Escap'd from care and harm;
205,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"She's mother to a Queen, who sleeps"
206,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Within a Monarch's arm.
207,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
208,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Who bore him first a daughter fine,"
209,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,And then a blooming heir;
210,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,They thank'd the Lord on every side
211,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,For all their fortune fair.
212,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,
213,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,The daughter now of Ellenlile
214,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Of England has the sway;
215,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"And Ellen with her yeoman lives,"
216,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,Each other's equals they.

221,URANIENBORG.,URANIENBORG.
222,URANIENBORG.,
223,URANIENBORG.,
224,URANIENBORG.,_From Heiberg_.
225,URANIENBORG.,
226,URANIENBORG.,"Thou who the strand dost wander,"
227,URANIENBORG.,"Thy steps, O traveller, stay!"
228,URANIENBORG.,"Turn to the island yonder,"
229,URANIENBORG.,And listen to my lay.
230,URANIENBORG.,Thy every meditation
231,URANIENBORG.,"Bid hither, hither stray:"
232,URANIENBORG.,On yonder banks its station
233,URANIENBORG.,Had once a Castelaye.
234,URANIENBORG.,
235,URANIENBORG.,In long past days in glory
236,URANIENBORG.,"It stood, and grandeur sheen"
237,URANIENBORG.,Now 'twas so transitory
238,URANIENBORG.,Its ruins scarce are seen.
239,URANIENBORG.,But in old days I warrant
240,URANIENBORG.,Its equal was not found;
241,URANIENBORG.,From every side apparent
242,URANIENBORG.,High tower'd it from the ground.
243,URANIENBORG.,
244,URANIENBORG.,For no sea-king intended
245,URANIENBORG.,I ween was yonder hold;
246,URANIENBORG.,"Urania, it ascended"
247,URANIENBORG.,In praise of thee so bold.
248,URANIENBORG.,"Close by the ocean roaring,"
249,URANIENBORG.,"Far, far from mortal jars,"
250,URANIENBORG.,"It stood tow'rds heaven soaring,"
251,URANIENBORG.,And tow'rds the little stars.
252,URANIENBORG.,
253,URANIENBORG.,"A gate in the wall eastward,"
254,URANIENBORG.,Display'd its mighty mouth;
255,URANIENBORG.,"There was another westward,"
256,URANIENBORG.,And spires stood north and south.
257,URANIENBORG.,"The dome itself, high rearing,"
258,URANIENBORG.,"A slender spirelet bore,"
259,URANIENBORG.,"Upon it, ever veering,"
260,URANIENBORG.,A Pegasus gilt o'er.
261,URANIENBORG.,
262,URANIENBORG.,Towers which the sight astounded
263,URANIENBORG.,In north and south were plac'd;
264,URANIENBORG.,"Upon strong pillars founded,"
265,URANIENBORG.,And with fair galleries grac'd.
266,URANIENBORG.,And there caught the attention
267,URANIENBORG.,"Of those that thither stroll'd,"
268,URANIENBORG.,"Quadrants of hugh dimension,"
269,URANIENBORG.,And speres in frames that roll'd.
270,URANIENBORG.,
271,URANIENBORG.,"From yonder Castle, gazing"
272,URANIENBORG.,"Across the isle, you spied"
273,URANIENBORG.,"The woods, their heads up-raising,"
274,URANIENBORG.,And ocean's bluey tide.
275,URANIENBORG.,The halls the sight enchanted
276,URANIENBORG.,With colours bright of blee;
277,URANIENBORG.,The gardens they were planted
278,URANIENBORG.,With many a flower and tree.
279,URANIENBORG.,
280,URANIENBORG.,When down came night careering
281,URANIENBORG.,"And vanish'd was the sun,"
282,URANIENBORG.,The stars were seen appearing
283,URANIENBORG.,All heaven's arch upon.
284,URANIENBORG.,"Then far was heard the yelling,"
285,URANIENBORG.,"When you thereto gave heed,"
286,URANIENBORG.,"Of those that watch'd the dwelling,"
287,URANIENBORG.,Four hounds of mastiff breed.
288,URANIENBORG.,
289,URANIENBORG.,The good knight ceas'd to walk on
290,URANIENBORG.,"The fields of war and gore,"
291,URANIENBORG.,His helm and sword the balk on
292,URANIENBORG.,"He hung, to use no more."
293,URANIENBORG.,"From earth, its woe and riot,"
294,URANIENBORG.,"His soul had taken flight,"
295,URANIENBORG.,When in his chamber quiet
296,URANIENBORG.,He sat at dead of night.
297,URANIENBORG.,
298,URANIENBORG.,Then he his eye erected
299,URANIENBORG.,"Into the night so far,"
300,URANIENBORG.,And keen the course inspected
301,URANIENBORG.,Of every twinkling star.
302,URANIENBORG.,The stars his fame transported
303,URANIENBORG.,"Wide over sea and land,"
304,URANIENBORG.,"And kings his friendship courted,"
305,URANIENBORG.,And sought his islet's strand.
306,URANIENBORG.,
307,URANIENBORG.,But point the stars from heaven
308,URANIENBORG.,To lands far o'er the main;
309,URANIENBORG.,"He went, by fortune driven,"
310,URANIENBORG.,And ne'er returned again.
311,URANIENBORG.,The haughty walls through sorrow
312,URANIENBORG.,"Have long since sunken low,"
313,URANIENBORG.,And heavy plow-shares furrow
314,URANIENBORG.,"Thy house, Urania, now."
315,URANIENBORG.,
316,URANIENBORG.,Each time the sun is sinking
317,URANIENBORG.,It friendly looks on Hveen;
318,URANIENBORG.,"Its rays there linger, thinking"
319,URANIENBORG.,On what the place has been.
320,URANIENBORG.,The moon hastes melancholy
321,URANIENBORG.,"Past, past the coast so dear,"
322,URANIENBORG.,And in love's transport holy
323,URANIENBORG.,Shines Freya's starlet clear.
324,URANIENBORG.,
325,URANIENBORG.,Then suddenly takes to heaving
326,URANIENBORG.,Of that same ruin'd hold
327,URANIENBORG.,"The basis deep, believing"
328,URANIENBORG.,It is some eve of old.
329,URANIENBORG.,For many moments gladly
330,URANIENBORG.,'Twould rise up from the mould;
331,URANIENBORG.,"But ah! it can't, and sadly"
332,URANIENBORG.,Sinks in death's slumber cold.
