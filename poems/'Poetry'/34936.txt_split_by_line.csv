177,SCENE I,"Place--Shushan, the Capital of Persia."
178,SCENE I,
179,SCENE I,Time--478 B.C.
180,SCENE I,
181,SCENE I,"[_A hall in the palace of the king. Enter Smerdis, the"
182,SCENE I,"king's jester, and Ahafid, poet and minstrel to the king,"
183,SCENE I,from opposite sides of the hall. Ahafid is already an old
184,SCENE I,"man, with long grey beard and a little stooped with age."
185,SCENE I,He carries a golden Persian harp on which he plays and
186,SCENE I,accompanies his own song._]
187,SCENE I,
188,SCENE I,_Ahafid_
189,SCENE I,
190,SCENE I,[_Sings._]
191,SCENE I,
192,SCENE I,Now War has doffed his mailed coat
193,SCENE I,And Peace forgot her art;
194,SCENE I,The lute but not the bugle's note
195,SCENE I,Can stir the kingly heart;
196,SCENE I,"Nights of revel and carp,"
197,SCENE I,"And days of sensuous rust,"
198,SCENE I,How can a poet's harp
199,SCENE I,Intone a song of lust?
200,SCENE I,
201,SCENE I,The king is mad. His flight from Salamis
202,SCENE I,Was bad enough. But that could be excused.
203,SCENE I,"For six months now what has he done but drink,"
204,SCENE I,"Carouse and wallow in lascivious ease,"
205,SCENE I,While subjects driven to despair with tax
206,SCENE I,Have fallen on the poisoned sword and cursed
207,SCENE I,In death the son of their once goodly king?
208,SCENE I,
209,SCENE I,_Smerdis_
210,SCENE I,
211,SCENE I,"Ahafid, you do seem to think the first"
212,SCENE I,Great business of a king is war. Now pray
213,SCENE I,"You, why should Xerxes waste the lusty days"
214,SCENE I,"Of youth in bloody strife? To furnish themes,"
215,SCENE I,"No doubt, for dullard bards and minstrelsy."
216,SCENE I,Ahasuerus is the wisest king
217,SCENE I,That ever sat upon a Persian throne.
218,SCENE I,"You graybeard fool, stupid as poets are."
219,SCENE I,Can you not see the wisdom of our king
220,SCENE I,"In substitution of the flight for death,"
221,SCENE I,"Of feast for fight, of wine for blood? Think you"
222,SCENE I,'Tis wise to wear the plaited mail of Mars
223,SCENE I,When Venus bids you to the festival
224,SCENE I,Of love?
225,SCENE I,
226,SCENE I,_Ahafid_
227,SCENE I,
228,SCENE I,You call me then a graybeard fool!
229,SCENE I,Though I have dropped the purple bloom of spring
230,SCENE I,The autumn's silvery down may indicate
231,SCENE I,The ripened fruit of wisdom which your youth
232,SCENE I,"Has never tasted. Smerdis, you are blind!"
233,SCENE I,"My beard is white, but vision clear. The king"
234,SCENE I,"Does daily waste the substance of his realm,"
235,SCENE I,And nightly dissipates his energies
236,SCENE I,"In vices of the blood. Vashti, the queen,"
237,SCENE I,"The idol of her people, is in grief."
238,SCENE I,
239,SCENE I,_Smerdis_
240,SCENE I,
241,SCENE I,In grief for what? Does she too wish the king
242,SCENE I,To take the field? I know our queen is fair
243,SCENE I,Of face and most voluptuous of form.
244,SCENE I,Perhaps her grief is due to jealousy.
245,SCENE I,"Would she monopolize his love, because"
246,SCENE I,Her beauty is surpassing?
247,SCENE I,
248,SCENE I,_Ahafid_
249,SCENE I,
250,SCENE I,Vashti does
251,SCENE I,Not know that she is beautiful. She loves
252,SCENE I,Her country and is brave as well as good.
253,SCENE I,I dread the issue of this night. The king
254,SCENE I,Has ordered that the queen be brought before
255,SCENE I,"The court, a target for licentious eyes."
256,SCENE I,She will refuse to go because her heart
257,SCENE I,"Is pure. Ahasuerus, flushed with wine,"
258,SCENE I,Will brook no opposition to his will.
259,SCENE I,A tragedy that never Persia knew
260,SCENE I,Will see the rising of to-morrow's sun.
261,SCENE I,
262,SCENE I,_Smerdis_
263,SCENE I,
264,SCENE I,A tragedy no country ever knew--
265,SCENE I,"A woman who is beautiful, but doesn't know it's true."
266,SCENE I,
267,SCENE I,_Ahafid_
268,SCENE I,
269,SCENE I,[_Sings._]
270,SCENE I,
271,SCENE I,"Oh, for a song to cleanse the heart"
272,SCENE I,Or touch the sceptred power;
273,SCENE I,"Oh, might the gods a strength impart"
274,SCENE I,To meet this tragic hour.
275,SCENE I,
276,SCENE I,[_Exeunt Ahafid and Smerdis._]
277,SCENE I,
278,SCENE I,[_Enter Vashti and Zethar._]
279,SCENE I,
280,SCENE I,_Vashti_
281,SCENE I,
282,SCENE I,"Oh, Zethar, do you think this night will end"
283,SCENE I,The revels that dishonor Persia's king?
284,SCENE I,To-day unknown I strolled through squalid parts
285,SCENE I,Of this old city and observed the poor.
286,SCENE I,"My lord, unmindful of their misery,"
287,SCENE I,Has laid a heavy tax for his insane
288,SCENE I,Extravagance upon the helpless child
289,SCENE I,"That begs in Shushan's streets. Not here alone,"
290,SCENE I,"This suffering; but Persia's peasantry,"
291,SCENE I,"The glory of the old empire, the heart"
292,SCENE I,"That once defied the world, is broken on"
293,SCENE I,The wheel of tax. And all for what?
294,SCENE I,
295,SCENE I,_Zethar_
296,SCENE I,
297,SCENE I,"O queen,"
298,SCENE I,Always the world has had its poverty.
299,SCENE I,You shall forget the poor. One stoop of wine
300,SCENE I,"Will bring you happiness. Vashti, drink."
301,SCENE I,
302,SCENE I,_Vashti_
303,SCENE I,
304,SCENE I,"Forgive me, Zethar, but no wine to-night."
305,SCENE I,
306,SCENE I,"[_Enter Meheuman, Biztha and Abagtha._]"
307,SCENE I,
308,SCENE I,_Meheuman_
309,SCENE I,
310,SCENE I,[_Loftily._]
311,SCENE I,
312,SCENE I,"Our most imperial queen, the king has laid"
313,SCENE I,"A banquet in the palace garden court,"
314,SCENE I,The crowning act of that munificence
315,SCENE I,"Toward prince and people great and small alike,"
316,SCENE I,Ahasuerus now for many months
317,SCENE I,Has shown the loyal subjects of his realm.
318,SCENE I,The adornment of the court displays a rich
319,SCENE I,Magnificence of taste; the couches are
320,SCENE I,Of fretted gold and silver set upon
321,SCENE I,A pavement of mosaic inlaid stone.
322,SCENE I,The drinking is according to the law--
323,SCENE I,"None can compel, each vessel is diverse,"
324,SCENE I,But all of gold. Th' abundance of the wine
325,SCENE I,Shows the unstinted bounty of the king.
326,SCENE I,"Our monarch's heart is merry in the cup,"
327,SCENE I,And boasts that Vashti's beauty does excel
328,SCENE I,"In magic power the fabled Helen's charms,"
329,SCENE I,And bids us bring immediately before
330,SCENE I,The court great Persia's matchless queen!
331,SCENE I,
332,SCENE I,_Vashti_
333,SCENE I,
334,SCENE I,"Meheuman, tell Ahasuerus I"
335,SCENE I,Must thank his majesty since he can still
336,SCENE I,"Remember Vashti's beauty, though his grace"
337,SCENE I,Has lost all sense of modesty and shame.
338,SCENE I,You say his heart is merry now in wine
339,SCENE I,And that he glories with exceeding pride
340,SCENE I,Because my face is fair to look upon!
341,SCENE I,I do not doubt his tongue is eloquent;
342,SCENE I,"The fiery phrase is his! Why, often I"
343,SCENE I,Have heard him praise his horse in language that
344,SCENE I,Seemed kindled at the altar of the gods.
345,SCENE I,It may be that he holds me higher than
346,SCENE I,His hundred concubines.
347,SCENE I,
348,SCENE I,_Meheuman_
349,SCENE I,
350,SCENE I,"Your majesty,"
351,SCENE I,The king does hold his queen a goddess.
352,SCENE I,
353,SCENE I,_Vashti_
354,SCENE I,
355,SCENE I,"Well,"
356,SCENE I,Perhaps he thinks himself divine. Go tell
357,SCENE I,The king I do not wish to be enrolled
358,SCENE I,Among divinities. I am the queen--
359,SCENE I,He must respect me as the one who wears
360,SCENE I,The Persian crown.
361,SCENE I,
362,SCENE I,'Tis scarce three years since he
363,SCENE I,Began to reign. He was Darius' son--
364,SCENE I,A king of whom the world was proud. He wooed
365,SCENE I,"Me as a prince of noble blood, and I"
366,SCENE I,Received his hand with dignity as well
367,SCENE I,"As love. I was a princess, but I had"
368,SCENE I,A heart. Long since I found that he had none.
369,SCENE I,A hundred eighty days continuous feast
370,SCENE I,He has oppressed the people of his rule
371,SCENE I,With drunken revels and with wanton waste.
372,SCENE I,And now to crown his sensuality
373,SCENE I,He sends his vulgar chamberlains to bring
374,SCENE I,Me to his palace garden that his lords
375,SCENE I,May gaze with unchaste eyes upon my form.
376,SCENE I,"Meheuman, Biztha, will you tell the king"
377,SCENE I,That Vashti bids him come to her if he
378,SCENE I,Would see the queen.
379,SCENE I,
380,SCENE I,_Meheuman_
381,SCENE I,
382,SCENE I,You understand
383,SCENE I,The costly hangings of the garden court
384,SCENE I,Are blue and green and white?
385,SCENE I,
386,SCENE I,_Vashti_
387,SCENE I,
388,SCENE I,Now pray you what
389,SCENE I,Significance has that? What if each couch
390,SCENE I,Is gold and silver and each goblet set
391,SCENE I,With stones?
392,SCENE I,
393,SCENE I,_Meheuman_
394,SCENE I,
395,SCENE I,The king's great love for Vashti!
396,SCENE I,
397,SCENE I,_Vashti_
398,SCENE I,
399,SCENE I,Then
400,SCENE I,He has prepared this banquet for his queen?
401,SCENE I,And does he think this is an evidence
402,SCENE I,Of love. It rather means the king's debauched.
403,SCENE I,I will not be a party to his sin.
404,SCENE I,
405,SCENE I,_Meheuman_
406,SCENE I,
407,SCENE I,The etiquette of court commands you to
408,SCENE I,Obey.
409,SCENE I,
410,SCENE I,_Vashti_
411,SCENE I,
412,SCENE I,"Commands! Well, has it come to that?"
413,SCENE I,But I will not obey. I am a queen!
414,SCENE I,"Here! Take this purple robe and coronet,"
415,SCENE I,And tell Ahasuerus to adorn
416,SCENE I,Some harlot of his harem. She will grace
417,SCENE I,The queenship of his kingdom better than
418,SCENE I,A pure and modest wife.
419,SCENE I,
420,SCENE I,_Abagtha_
421,SCENE I,
422,SCENE I,You do not know
423,SCENE I,The meaning of your words!
424,SCENE I,
425,SCENE I,_Vashti_
426,SCENE I,
427,SCENE I,"Abagtha, why"
428,SCENE I,Do you admonish me? Do I not know
429,SCENE I,"The forfeit? Chamberlains, this message take"
430,SCENE I,Licentious Xerxes from his virtuous queen:
431,SCENE I,I do not fear his wrath. I will not come
432,SCENE I,At his command. I have a royal heart
433,SCENE I,And will not thus disgrace the Persian throne.
434,SCENE I,The king that's halfway worthy of my hand
435,SCENE I,Would hate the queen that yielded to his lust.
436,SCENE I,"My heart, O chamberlains, is broken, not"
437,SCENE I,"That Vashti's crown is lost, but oh, to see"
438,SCENE I,The regal name of Persia brought so low!
439,SCENE I,I weep. The tears are for my country. Go!

446,SCENE II,SCENE II
447,SCENE II,
448,SCENE II,[_Outer hall in palace. Throne room back concealed by
449,SCENE II,"curtain. Queen Esther, disguised by loose dress thrown"
450,SCENE II,over royal robe and head and face below the eyes hidden by
451,SCENE II,"mask, approaches the door where Mordecai, the Jew, is"
452,SCENE II,standing._]
453,SCENE II,
454,SCENE II,_Mordecai_
455,SCENE II,
456,SCENE II,"Ah, Esther! Though your queenly robe you do"
457,SCENE II,"Conceal, I know that regal gait. Before"
458,SCENE II,"I ever looked upon these palace walls,"
459,SCENE II,When you were yet a little child beyond
460,SCENE II,"The purple peaks, where shepherds led their flocks"
461,SCENE II,"In pastures green, I often dreamed that you"
462,SCENE II,Would one day wear a golden coronet
463,SCENE II,And sit in majesty upon a throne.
464,SCENE II,
465,SCENE II,_Esther_
466,SCENE II,
467,SCENE II,[_Dejectedly._]
468,SCENE II,
469,SCENE II,"Four years I have been queen, which time I have"
470,SCENE II,Not heard the voice of any one I love;
471,SCENE II,"And though disguised, I hardly dare to speak"
472,SCENE II,My heart even to you. This palace is
473,SCENE II,A gloomy prison cell. The Persian crown
474,SCENE II,Is meaningless to me. The hundred gems
475,SCENE II,That blaze upon its field of gold are dull
476,SCENE II,And heavy lead. I would exchange it all
477,SCENE II,For but a glint of sunshine on the hills
478,SCENE II,Where I was born. But why this interview?
479,SCENE II,
480,SCENE II,_Mordecai_
481,SCENE II,
482,SCENE II,"My royal niece, I know that you are queen."
483,SCENE II,
484,SCENE II,_Esther_
485,SCENE II,
486,SCENE II,"A queen? But what of that? Though of my blood,"
487,SCENE II,You can not even look upon my face.
488,SCENE II,What would you have?
489,SCENE II,
490,SCENE II,[_Wailing without._]
491,SCENE II,
492,SCENE II,_Mordecai_
493,SCENE II,
494,SCENE II,"My daughter, do you hear"
495,SCENE II,The cries of anguish that disturb the peace
496,SCENE II,Of Shushan's streets? Your people everywhere
497,SCENE II,Are clothed in sackcloth. Read the king's decree!

499,SCENE II,[_Handing her paper._]

509,SCENE II,"And princes and lieutenants, everyone"

511,SCENE II,"To die and perish every Jew, both young"
512,SCENE II,"And old, the women and the children, rich"

522,SCENE II,
523,SCENE II,_Esther_
524,SCENE II,
525,SCENE II,Why does the premier hate
526,SCENE II,The Jews?
527,SCENE II,
528,SCENE II,_Mordecai_
529,SCENE II,
530,SCENE II,Because the children of the true
531,SCENE II,And living God will never bend the knee
532,SCENE II,To heathen pride. He hates the Jews because
533,SCENE II,Your uncle is a child of Abraham
534,SCENE II,And will not do obeisance to a son
535,SCENE II,"Of Baal. Esther, though I made you queen,"
536,SCENE II,"I plead not for the life of Mordecai,"
537,SCENE II,But for the sacred blood of Israel.
538,SCENE II,You alone can intervene. Go straight
539,SCENE II,Before the king and make demand that he
540,SCENE II,Reverse this law that puts the Jews to death.
541,SCENE II,
542,SCENE II,_Esther_
543,SCENE II,
544,SCENE II,A Persian king can not reverse his own
545,SCENE II,"Decree. Besides, the queen who goes into"
546,SCENE II,The presence of her lord unless by his
547,SCENE II,"Express command, must sacrifice her life,"
548,SCENE II,Except through some unguarded impulse he
549,SCENE II,Extends his golden sceptre that she live.
550,SCENE II,I can not go unto the king.
551,SCENE II,
552,SCENE II,_Mordecai_
553,SCENE II,
554,SCENE II,Your life
555,SCENE II,"Is forfeited already, child; you are"
556,SCENE II,A Jew.
557,SCENE II,
558,SCENE II,_Esther_
559,SCENE II,
560,SCENE II,You did conceal my blood nor dare
561,SCENE II,Reveal my lineage now. Your own deceit
562,SCENE II,"Has brought this death upon the house of Israel,"
563,SCENE II,Nor will Jehovah hold you guiltless in
564,SCENE II,The hour of doom.
565,SCENE II,
566,SCENE II,_Mordecai_
567,SCENE II,
568,SCENE II,"Esther, if you keep"
569,SCENE II,Your peace when Rachel's children wail and cry
570,SCENE II,"For help, deliverance will arise"
571,SCENE II,Unto the Jews but you shall be destroyed
572,SCENE II,And all your father's house.
573,SCENE II,

584,SCENE II,[_The curtain back rises and discloses Ahasuerus on his
585,SCENE II,throne surrounded by court. Esther approaches to center
586,SCENE II,"of hall before the king, and extends her hands as"
587,SCENE II,though supplicating. The king seems dazed for a moment
588,SCENE II,and then deeply moved; slowly he lifts the golden
589,SCENE II,sceptre and extends it toward the queen who approaches
590,SCENE II,and touches it._]
591,SCENE II,
592,SCENE II,_Ahasuerus_
593,SCENE II,
594,SCENE II,"Why did you, Esther, O most beauteous queen,"
595,SCENE II,Thus dare to come unbidden to the king?
596,SCENE II,'Twas jealous Death unbarred the royal door
597,SCENE II,That he might claim you for his paramour?

600,SCENE II,_Esther_
601,SCENE II,
602,SCENE II,[_Innocently._]
603,SCENE II,
604,SCENE II,"My lord, how now was I in danger? Ah,"
605,SCENE II,You know I am your loyal wife? I would
606,SCENE II,Not be your queen alone. The crown is naught
607,SCENE II,Compared to pleasures of companionship.
608,SCENE II,"O Xerxes, may not Esther share your joys"
609,SCENE II,Of wine and song? Too long you have denied
610,SCENE II,That which I covet most--to be beside
611,SCENE II,My king.
612,SCENE II,
613,SCENE II,_Ahasuerus_
614,SCENE II,
615,SCENE II,"There is no favor, Esther, I"
616,SCENE II,Would longer hold from you; even to half
617,SCENE II,"My kingdom, tell me what you most desire,"
618,SCENE II,And I will give it you.
619,SCENE II,
620,SCENE II,_Esther_
621,SCENE II,
622,SCENE II,"My lord, I have"
623,SCENE II,"Already spoke my heart, but you will not"
624,SCENE II,"Believe. To test Ahasuerus' love,"
625,SCENE II,I have a favor I would ask of you;
626,SCENE II,But first that my most gracious lord may know
627,SCENE II,"His queen has taste and skill as well as charms,"
628,SCENE II,I will prepare a banquet for the king
629,SCENE II,"With my own hands. You are a judge of wine,"
630,SCENE II,And every dish that graces banquet halls.
631,SCENE II,"To-morrow, let Ahasuerus come,"
632,SCENE II,"And bring his premier Haman, who no doubt"
633,SCENE II,"Can tell a heron from a hawk, and if"
634,SCENE II,"My lord shall praise my art, and I"
635,SCENE II,"Find favor in his sight, I will make known"
636,SCENE II,My dearest wish.

660,SCENE III,
661,SCENE III,_Haman_
662,SCENE III,
663,SCENE III,My star grows brighter with each setting sun;
664,SCENE III,The lowly child of old Hammedetha
665,SCENE III,Is first among the servants of the king.
666,SCENE III,"Ah, Mordecai, you did not know I am"
667,SCENE III,"An Agagite, who fed upon the breast"
668,SCENE III,Of unrelenting hate toward every child
669,SCENE III,"Of Israel, who will not bend the knee"

671,SCENE III,
672,SCENE III,[_Wailing in Street._]
673,SCENE III,
674,SCENE III,"You, Zeresh, hear that wail of anguish? Love,"

677,SCENE III,
678,SCENE III,_Zeresh_
679,SCENE III,
680,I,I
681,I,Am proud of Haman's power.
682,I,
683,I,_Haman_
684,I,
685,I,Go call our friends.
686,I,
687,I,_Zeresh_
688,I,
689,I,Before the rising sun had touched with gold
690,I,"The treetops on the peaks of Zagros, Tesh,"
691,I,"The son of Zalphon, was abroad"
692,I,In Shushan on the errand of my lord.
693,I,
694,I,_Haman_
695,I,
696,I,"Not only in this city, but, my spouse,"
697,I,"In every province of the king, the Jews"
698,I,In sackcloth mourn because of Haman's might.
699,I,But would you know the secret of my strength?
700,I,This ring! The seal of Xerxes. It is death
701,I,To every drop of Jacob's blood within
702,I,The Domain of Ahasuerus' rule.
703,I,
704,I,_Zeresh_
705,I,
706,I,The guests are coming.
707,I,
708,I,_Haman_
709,I,
710,I,"Oh, the messages"
711,I,Of enmity are swift as shafts of love.
712,I,"Now, Zeresh, call the servants of the house"
713,I,"And set a sumptuous feast, for Haman would"
714,I,Take counsel of his friends.
715,I,
716,I,_Zeresh_
717,I,
718,I,"My gracious lord,"
719,I,The table is already set. Go greet
720,I,The guests and bring them in.
721,I,
722,I,[_Exit Haman._]
723,I,
724,I,[_Zeresh continues._]
725,I,
726,I,"Parshandatha,"
727,I,What do you think of Haman? Did you note
728,I,My lord?
729,I,
730,I,_Parshandatha_
731,I,
732,I,"I did, madam. His happiness"
733,I,Is most complete. His rapid rise to power
734,I,"Has all but ravished him with joy. And yet,"
735,I,Methought that something still he lacked. Perhaps
736,I,The queen's consent has not yet been obtained
737,I,To this decree that puts the Jews to death.
738,I,
739,I,_Zeresh_
740,I,
741,I,What do you mean? The queen's consent? My Lord
742,I,"Has naught to do with Xerxes' wife, and why"
743,I,Should he be troubled for a woman's whim?
744,I,"Besides, who knows but Esther does approve"
745,I,This slaughter of the Jews?
746,I,
747,I,_Parshandatha_
748,I,
749,I,"Approve, madam?"
750,I,"She is a queen, but still a woman!"
751,I,
752,I,_Zeresh_
753,I,
754,I,So
755,I,"Am I, though not a queen! A woman, yes"
756,I,But with no stomach for that hated race!
757,I,
758,I,_Parshandatha_
759,I,
760,I,'Tis whispered in the court that Esther is
761,I,Herself a Jew.
762,I,
763,I,_Zeresh_
764,I,
765,I,The Persian queen a Jew!
766,I,Then let her perish with her blood.
767,I,
768,I,_Parshandatha_
769,I,
770,I,But would
771,I,My lord consent to Esther's death?
772,I,
773,I,_Zeresh_
774,I,
775,I,Consent
776,I,"Again! Parshandatha, why do you harp"
777,I,Upon consent? Now listen to my words.
778,I,But should you e'er disclose one breath
779,I,"Of what I say, you are yourself a Jew,"
780,I,Nor is there any power in Persia's king
781,I,To save your life. My lord pretends to hate
782,I,The Jews. His hate is only wounded pride.
783,I,The deference of Mordecai is all
784,I,That Haman wants. He does not know the queen
785,I,Is Hebrew blood. This fact must still be kept
786,I,"Concealed--concealed, that is, until the day"
787,I,"Of death. Oh, he shall know who Esther is--"
788,I,This Israelite that banquets with my lord!
789,I,You think his rise is due to Esther's power?
790,I,
791,I,_Parshandatha_
792,I,
793,I,"Madam, I do not know."
794,I,
795,I,_Zeresh_
796,I,
797,I,Not know! not know!
798,I,"But what think you, Parshandatha? Of course"
799,I,You do not know.
800,I,
801,I,_Parshandatha_
802,I,
803,I,"Madam, he often dines"
804,I,With Esther and the king. The king no doubt
805,I,Is very fond of your most gracious lord.
806,I,
807,I,_Zeresh_
808,I,
809,I,The king!
810,I,
811,I,_Parshandatha_
812,I,
813,I,Mayhap the queen also. Your lord
814,I,Is young and handsome still. The king is far
815,I,Beyond the queen in years.
816,I,
817,I,_Zeresh_
818,I,
819,I,I can
820,I,Not catch your drift.
821,I,
822,I,_Parshandatha_
823,I,
824,I,"Madam, your husband has"
825,I,A ready wit. The queen enjoys life.
826,I,
827,I,_Zeresh_
828,I,
829,I,Enjoys life!
830,I,"And so do I, and likewise death. Now hold"
831,I,Your blasted tongue. My husband sups again
832,I,To-morrow with the Jewish queen. They say
833,I,When Haman dines her majesty prepares
834,I,The banquet with her own most dainty hand!
835,I,"Parshandatha, whose hand, think you, has laid"
836,I,The feast of Adar?
837,I,
838,I,_Parshandatha_
839,I,
840,I,Zeresh! call you death
841,I,A feast!
842,I,
843,I,_Zeresh_
844,I,
845,I,A glorious feast on which my soul
846,I,"Already feeds, and Esther shall be there!"
847,I,
848,I,[_Re-enter Haman and Friends._]
849,I,
850,I,_Haman_
851,I,
852,I,Be seated at the table.
853,I,
854,I,Citizens
855,I,"Of Shushan, patriots of Persia, friends,"
856,I,The servant of the king has called you here
857,I,To tell you of his triumph and to ask
858,I,Your sage advice. Two days ago the prince
859,I,And I sat down together to a feast
860,I,Within the palace walls and drank your health.
861,I,The royal cup was blushing like the spume
862,I,"Of autumn clouds at sunset, when a wail"
863,I,Arose in Shushan that has sore perplexed
864,I,"The people. Mordecai, the haughty Jew,"
865,I,"Who sits beside the palace gate, refused"
866,I,"To bow or do me reverence, although"
867,I,Admonished by the king. I was born
868,I,A humble subject in the private ranks
869,I,Of life; but now I wear the signet ring
870,I,"Of Xerxes. Friends, the law that dooms the Jews"
871,I,To simultaneous slaughter can not be
872,I,Revoked. Last night the queen invited me
873,I,To banquet with her lord. The necklace that
874,I,She wore of iridescent pearls was like
875,I,"A rainbow over polar snows. Ah, she"
876,I,Was fair to look upon! And now my cup
877,I,Was filled to overflowing--
878,I,
879,I,[_Zeresh shows great emotion._]
880,I,
881,I,"(Zeresh, are"
882,I,You ill?)--when Esther begged that I would come
883,I,Again to-morrow to another feast
884,I,Her hand would lay for Haman and the king.
885,I,My wealth is multiplied beyond my ken;
886,I,The sceptre is almost within my grasp.
887,I,"But all these things avail me naught, so long"
888,I,As yonder hated Jew remains unbent.
889,I,
890,I,_A Friend_
891,I,
892,I,Destroy the brute at once!
893,I,
894,I,_Haman_
895,I,
896,I,"Oh, that will not"
897,I,"Suffice. 'Tis not his death, but homage that"
898,I,"Must sweeten my revenge. Ah, I would see"
899,I,Him groveling on the earth as Haman passed.
900,I,My rank and station must be recognized.
901,I,I sit beside the king; I am premier
902,I,Of Persia. Yet this Jewish dog is still
903,I,Unmoved!
904,I,

912,I,"O Zeresh, you are like the rising sun--"
913,I,An inspiration in the hour of gloom.
914,I,"We'll build this gallows fifty cubits high,"
915,I,And then his Hebrew pride will bite the dust.
916,I,"Oh, I can hear him whining like a cur,"
917,I,"My love, your wisdom is above the head."
918,I,A woman's heart is like an oracle
919,I,"Divine. Prepare this gallows. Friends, I go"
920,I,At dawn to greet the king. At night we dine
921,I,"Alone with Esther, and--"
922,I,
923,I,[_Zeresh faints._]
924,I,

1058,SCENE I,"Ah, yes, Ahafid, yes, Aurora in"

1074,SCENE I,
1075,SCENE I,[_Not hearing._] Ahasuerus does not seem

1107,SCENE I,
1108,SCENE I,_Smerdis_
1109,SCENE I,
1110,SCENE I,A bathrobe or some new stars for her crown.

1136,SCENE I,When Haman wrote that every Jew must die
1137,SCENE I,Because the Hebrew Mordecai refused

1139,SCENE I,
1140,SCENE I,_Smerdis_

1194,SCENE II,
1195,SCENE II,_Esther_
1196,SCENE II,
1197,SCENE II,"But, my lord, you are"
1198,SCENE II,"A connoisseur, and can but speak these words"
1199,SCENE II,"In flattery. O king, it was my heart,"
1200,SCENE II,And not my hand that flavored every dish

1202,SCENE II,
1203,SCENE II,_Ahasuerus_
1204,SCENE II,
1205,SCENE II,"Esther, now it is"

1208,SCENE II,"A connoisseur, say you? Haman, can"
1209,SCENE II,"You tell me, now, what bay or bight in all"

1246,SCENE II,"[_Laughing, changing rapidly to deep feeling._]"
1247,SCENE II,

1310,SCENE II,[_More emphatic._]
1311,SCENE II,

1313,SCENE II,"Last night I could not sleep, and so I had"
1314,SCENE II,"The book of records read, the chronicles,"
1315,SCENE II,Wherein I learned that this same Mordecai
1316,SCENE II,"The Jew had saved Ahasuerus' life,"
1317,SCENE II,When Teresh and another chamberlain
1318,SCENE II,Had sought to lay the hand of violence
1319,SCENE II,Upon your king. Let nothing fail of all
1320,SCENE II,That you have spoken should be done to him
1321,SCENE II,The king delighteth now to honor most.
1322,SCENE II,"And Esther, tell Ahasuerus now"
1323,SCENE II,Your dearest wish. On yesterday I begged
1324,SCENE II,To know the favor you did most desire
1325,SCENE II,"And now it shall be granted unto you,"
1326,SCENE II,"Whatever your request, even to half"
1327,SCENE II,"My kingdom, it shall be performed."

1335,SCENE II,My life be given unto me at my
1336,SCENE II,Petition and my people live at my

1347,SCENE II,
1348,SCENE II,_Esther_
1349,SCENE II,
1350,SCENE II,"There stands this adversary, O my king,"

1355,SCENE II,Haman! Haman! What

1358,SCENE II,
1359,SCENE II,_Esther_
1360,SCENE II,
1361,SCENE II,I mean this craven whom you have advanced

1363,SCENE II,"The queen, as well as every other Jew"
1364,SCENE II,"That breathes the Persian air, both young and old"

1379,SCENE II,[_A dramatic pause. Esther awaits the decision of the
1380,SCENE II,"king, who for a time seems to waver, then extends his"

1419,SCENE II,A lover of this queen! A paramour
1420,SCENE II,Of her who boasts that she can trace her blood
1421,SCENE II,An unpolluted stream a thousand years
1422,SCENE II,To one who watched his humble flocks on bleak
1423,SCENE II,Judean hills. A shepherd queen that rules
1424,SCENE II,"The Persian throne, and you, O Haman, you"
1425,SCENE II,"That fed on venom for her race, are now,"
1426,SCENE II,"Though premier, a cringing, craven wretch,"

1488,SCENE I,"Was not insane. So I raised Cain, obtained the reign"
1489,SCENE I,"Of this campaign, and still remain, though they were slain."""
1490,SCENE I,
1491,SCENE I,_Ahafid_
1492,SCENE I,
1493,SCENE I,I think I must be growing deaf. You rhymed?
1494,SCENE I,
1495,SCENE I,_Smerdis_
1496,SCENE I,
1497,SCENE I,"I only spoke a little joke. If I could sing, I'd say the ring,"
1498,SCENE I,And not the king explains the thing.
1499,SCENE I,
1500,SCENE I,_Ahafid_
1501,SCENE I,
1502,SCENE I,But does
1503,SCENE I,The God of Abraham inspire revenge?
1504,SCENE I,The worshippers of Moloch would have shrunk
1505,SCENE I,From such a day of death. I marvel that
1506,SCENE I,Queen Esther did not intervene. She rules
1507,SCENE I,The king. But wherefore did I say the king?
1508,SCENE I,
1509,SCENE I,_Smerdis_
1510,SCENE I,
1511,SCENE I,I think it must have been to rhyme with ring.
1512,SCENE I,
1513,SCENE I,_Ahafid_
1514,SCENE I,
1515,SCENE I,Darius' son's a spineless debauchee.
1516,SCENE I,
1517,SCENE I,[_Sings._]
1518,SCENE I,
1519,SCENE I,The Jew the purple robe enfolds
1520,SCENE I,And eke the royal gown;
1521,SCENE I,For Mordecai the sceptre holds
1522,SCENE I,And Esther wears the crown.
1523,SCENE I,
1524,SCENE I,[_Exit Ahafid._]
1525,SCENE I,
1526,SCENE I,_Smerdis_
1527,SCENE I,
1528,SCENE I,"Ahafid said he couldn't sing Ahasuerus' praise,"
1529,SCENE I,And that his harp had lost the tone it had in other days.
1530,SCENE I,"But though the Jews are on the throne and Xerxes maudlin full,"
1531,SCENE I,Ahafid once more tunes his lyre and bellows like a bull.
1532,SCENE I,
1533,SCENE I,"Look out, here comes the Jew, a cloud upon"
1534,SCENE I,"His brow, the weight of empires on his brain."
1535,SCENE I,What matters does he now revolve? I fear
1536,SCENE I,The day of Adar troubles Mordecai.
1537,SCENE I,We'll stand aside and hear the premier.
1538,SCENE I,
1539,SCENE I,[_Exit Smerdis._]
1540,SCENE I,
1541,SCENE I,"[_Enter Mordecai meditatively, followed by Zeresh, who is"
1542,SCENE I,unseen by him at first._]
1543,SCENE I,
1544,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1545,SCENE I,
1546,SCENE I,The name of Haman perish from the earth!
1547,SCENE I,The seed of Abraham be multiplied
1548,SCENE I,Until they are as numberless as sands
1549,SCENE I,"Upon ocean's shore! This was my prayer,"
1550,SCENE I,I learned it at my mother's knee. Was I
1551,SCENE I,Not justified?
1552,SCENE I,
1553,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1554,SCENE I,
1555,SCENE I,[_Disguised as a Hebrew woman._]
1556,SCENE I,
1557,SCENE I,"The Holy Scripture saith,"
1558,SCENE I,"""Vengeance belongs to God."""
1559,SCENE I,
1560,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1561,SCENE I,
1562,SCENE I,But was I not
1563,SCENE I,His instrument? Jehovah wrought through me;
1564,SCENE I,"His will, not mine was done."
1565,SCENE I,
1566,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1567,SCENE I,
1568,SCENE I,And yet His will
1569,SCENE I,Was yours?
1570,SCENE I,
1571,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1572,SCENE I,
1573,SCENE I,The wicked Haman would have slain
1574,SCENE I,Even the queen herself and every Jew
1575,SCENE I,That lives within the hundred provinces
1576,SCENE I,Of Xerxes' weak and vacillating rule.
1577,SCENE I,
1578,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1579,SCENE I,
1580,SCENE I,Thy action was no more than self-defense?
1581,SCENE I,
1582,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1583,SCENE I,
1584,SCENE I,"Not self-defense of Mordecai alone,"
1585,SCENE I,"But of my blood, of Esther and the sons"
1586,SCENE I,"Of Jacob, exiled and defenseless else."
1587,SCENE I,"The God of Abraham may chasten, but"
1588,SCENE I,"He keeps his promises, nor will forsake."
1589,SCENE I,Rameses sat upon his haughty throne
1590,SCENE I,"And knew not Joseph, for my people were"
1591,SCENE I,Oppressed with bitter bondage and their lives
1592,SCENE I,Made hard in mortar and in brick; but still
1593,SCENE I,They grew in numbers and increased and waxed
1594,SCENE I,"Exceeding mighty, till the land was filled"
1595,SCENE I,With them. And then the king was sore afraid
1596,SCENE I,And wroth because the Jews had never bent
1597,SCENE I,The knee at Egypt's shrines. He could enslave
1598,SCENE I,But not corrupt the children of the true
1599,SCENE I,And living God. And then he called
1600,SCENE I,The Hebrew midwives and commanded them
1601,SCENE I,To slay thereafter every son that might
1602,SCENE I,Be born to Jacob's sacred blood. God kept
1603,SCENE I,His covenant with Abraham and raised
1604,SCENE I,"Up Moses, the deliverer, and when"
1605,SCENE I,"The plagues had failed to soften Pharaoh's heart,"
1606,SCENE I,The Lord smote every firstborn in the land
1607,SCENE I,"Of Egypt, save where hyssop mixed with blood"
1608,SCENE I,Was sprinkled on the lintel of the door
1609,SCENE I,"And on the two side posts, as Moses had"
1610,SCENE I,"Directed. Saviour of his people, son"
1611,SCENE I,"Of Amram and of Jochebed, obscure"
1612,SCENE I,"Levites, found in an ark of bulrushes"
1613,SCENE I,Afloat among the flags near by the spot
1614,SCENE I,"Where Pharaoh's daughter bathed, and yet, and yet--"
1615,SCENE I,
1616,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1617,SCENE I,
1618,SCENE I,Was Moses not selected by the Lord
1619,SCENE I,To lead the Israelites into the Land
1620,SCENE I,Of Promise?
1621,SCENE I,
1622,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1623,SCENE I,
1624,SCENE I,[_As in soliloquy._]
1625,SCENE I,
1626,SCENE I,And did he not talk with God
1627,SCENE I,"Upon the Mount of Sinai, when smoke"
1628,SCENE I,"Enveloped all the peak, and even priests"
1629,SCENE I,Were not allowed upon that holy ground?
1630,SCENE I,Was I more lowly than was Amram's child?
1631,SCENE I,
1632,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1633,SCENE I,
1634,SCENE I,Yet God exalted him until the throne
1635,SCENE I,Of Egypt was within his grasp.
1636,SCENE I,
1637,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1638,SCENE I,
1639,SCENE I,"Though I,"
1640,SCENE I,"Like Jesse's son, was once a shepherd's lad,"
1641,SCENE I,To-day I rule ten million souls.
1642,SCENE I,Now Moses was a vessel of the Lord
1643,SCENE I,"When Death passed over every Hebrew home,"
1644,SCENE I,But slew the firstborn where no blood was found.
1645,SCENE I,"Was this revenge? Not Moses' hand, but God's"
1646,SCENE I,Was red.
1647,SCENE I,
1648,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1649,SCENE I,
1650,SCENE I,The servant must obey his Lord.
1651,SCENE I,
1652,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1653,SCENE I,
1654,SCENE I,I did not plot the Persians' death. The plan
1655,SCENE I,Of God was in it all.
1656,SCENE I,
1657,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1658,SCENE I,
1659,SCENE I,Else why were you
1660,SCENE I,Made premier at the moment when the Jews
1661,SCENE I,Faced death in every province of the king?
1662,SCENE I,
1663,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1664,SCENE I,
1665,SCENE I,"It was my hand that stopped the massacre,"
1666,SCENE I,But God avenged the awful wrong!
1667,SCENE I,
1668,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1669,SCENE I,
1670,SCENE I,And Esther! How is it with her? You made
1671,SCENE I,"Her queen. She was a humble Hebrew girl,"
1672,SCENE I,"Unknown and friendless, but for Mordecai."
1673,SCENE I,
1674,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1675,SCENE I,
1676,SCENE I,She should be grateful for the crown I gave.
1677,SCENE I,
1678,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1679,SCENE I,
1680,SCENE I,But Hatach says her cheeks are often wet
1681,SCENE I,With tears.
1682,SCENE I,
1683,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1684,SCENE I,
1685,SCENE I,It may be that she weeps for him
1686,SCENE I,Who won her girlish heart before we came
1687,SCENE I,To Shushan or had ever seen the king.
1688,SCENE I,
1689,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1690,SCENE I,
1691,SCENE I,And yet that can not be. The shepherd's crook
1692,SCENE I,Is not the golden sceptre of a king.
1693,SCENE I,I have no doubt that she has long since ceased
1694,SCENE I,"To think of youthful dreams. She rules the king,"
1695,SCENE I,And what more does a woman want?
1696,SCENE I,
1697,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1698,SCENE I,
1699,SCENE I,I did
1700,SCENE I,Not hope to make her understand at once.
1701,SCENE I,My reasons were too subtle for her heart.
1702,SCENE I,"And so I kept my counsel, for I knew"
1703,SCENE I,No girl would ever sacrifice her love
1704,SCENE I,To save the remnant of a nation's life.
1705,SCENE I,
1706,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1707,SCENE I,
1708,SCENE I,[_Justifying._]
1709,SCENE I,
1710,SCENE I,And why might even Esther not forget
1711,SCENE I,When once she felt the spell of royal power--
1712,SCENE I,The tinsel show and glamour of the court?
1713,SCENE I,No woman lives that would not be a queen.
1714,SCENE I,
1715,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1716,SCENE I,
1717,SCENE I,"I knew Ahasuerus was a brute,"
1718,SCENE I,But what of that? Through Esther I have saved
1719,SCENE I,A half a million souls.
1720,SCENE I,
1721,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1722,SCENE I,
1723,SCENE I,[_Aside._]
1724,SCENE I,
1725,SCENE I,Through Esther you
1726,SCENE I,Have slain a million souls.
1727,SCENE I,
1728,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1729,SCENE I,
1730,SCENE I,When Jepthah vowed
1731,SCENE I,A vow unto the Lord he kept his pledge
1732,SCENE I,And slew the only daughter of his flesh
1733,SCENE I,"For a burnt offering unto God, because"
1734,SCENE I,"The Ammonites, his enemy, had been"
1735,SCENE I,Delivered to the hands of Israel.
1736,SCENE I,Now Esther was my only child.
1737,SCENE I,
1738,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1739,SCENE I,
1740,SCENE I,[_A little sarcastically._]
1741,SCENE I,
1742,SCENE I,You have
1743,SCENE I,"Not sacrificed, but elevated her."
1744,SCENE I,"Although she does not understand your heart,"
1745,SCENE I,She can but bless her uncle Mordecai.
1746,SCENE I,
1747,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1748,SCENE I,
1749,SCENE I,But why should Esther weep? She risked her life
1750,SCENE I,"At my behest, but did she not obtain"
1751,SCENE I,Great favor with the king?
1752,SCENE I,
1753,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1754,SCENE I,
1755,SCENE I,And Esther's life
1756,SCENE I,Was forfeit then through Haman's wicked hate.
1757,SCENE I,
1758,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1759,SCENE I,
1760,SCENE I,I wear the royal robe of blue and white.
1761,SCENE I,
1762,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1763,SCENE I,
1764,SCENE I,Does Esther think because her vanity
1765,SCENE I,Is flattered by the jewels of a queen
1766,SCENE I,That Mordecai is moved by pomp and show?
1767,SCENE I,
1768,SCENE I,_Mordecai_
1769,SCENE I,
1770,SCENE I,'Tis not the kingly trappings but the seal--
1771,SCENE I,"Not sceptre merely but the signet ring,"
1772,SCENE I,"Not rank, but rule that Mordecai would have."
1773,SCENE I,I can not understand her tears no more
1774,SCENE I,Than she knows why I wear the crown. But I
1775,SCENE I,Am justified. Jehovah wrought through me.
1776,SCENE I,
1777,SCENE I,[_Exit Mordecai._]
1778,SCENE I,
1779,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1780,SCENE I,
1781,SCENE I,[_Bursting into fury._]
1782,SCENE I,
1783,SCENE I,Jehovah wrought through him! Hell wrought through him!
1784,SCENE I,I marvel that his tongue is not consumed
1785,SCENE I,By blasted lies. Wait till he feels the flame
1786,SCENE I,That rages in my heart. Hell may not burn
1787,SCENE I,"A Jew, but even he can not withstand"
1788,SCENE I,The simoon of a fiery dragon's breath!
1789,SCENE I,
1790,SCENE I,_Parshandatha_
1791,SCENE I,
1792,SCENE I,"But Zeresh, was the Jew not justified?"
1793,SCENE I,
1794,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1795,SCENE I,
1796,SCENE I,"Justified! gratified! satisfied! Parshandatha,"
1797,SCENE I,Justified in Jepthah; gratified
1798,SCENE I,That he is like the meek and lowly son
1799,SCENE I,Of Amram; satisfied that now the crown
1800,SCENE I,Of Persia presses only Hebrew brows.
1801,SCENE I,
1802,SCENE I,_Parshandatha_
1803,SCENE I,
1804,SCENE I,[_Sarcastically._]
1805,SCENE I,
1806,SCENE I,"You do forget my lord, Darius' son."
1807,SCENE I,You can not think the blood of Jacob flows
1808,SCENE I,Through Xerxes' veins? Does he not wear the crown?
1809,SCENE I,
1810,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1811,SCENE I,
1812,SCENE I,[_With contempt._]
1813,SCENE I,
1814,SCENE I,Ahasuerus wears a pigeon's heart.
1815,SCENE I,The Persian robe's a Jewish gabardine;
1816,SCENE I,"The crown, a Hebrew priest's phylactery."
1817,SCENE I,But did you say forget? Have you been so
1818,SCENE I,"Long with me, dear, and doubt my memory?"
1819,SCENE I,"Forget Ahasuerus, did you say?"
1820,SCENE I,"That minion of a Jewish girl, who sealed"
1821,SCENE I,The death of Haman and his sons? His face
1822,SCENE I,"Is seared upon my heart, his image burnt"
1823,SCENE I,Into my brain. I tell you Xerxes is
1824,SCENE I,No longer king.
1825,SCENE I,
1826,SCENE I,_Parshandatha_
1827,SCENE I,
1828,SCENE I,But is not Esther queen?
1829,SCENE I,
1830,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1831,SCENE I,
1832,SCENE I,"Parshandatha, why do you taunt me thus?"
1833,SCENE I,Have I not proved your friend? Do I deserve
1834,SCENE I,Your mockery?
1835,SCENE I,
1836,SCENE I,_Parshandatha_
1837,SCENE I,
1838,SCENE I,I do but speak to sting
1839,SCENE I,You to revenge.
1840,SCENE I,
1841,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1842,SCENE I,
1843,SCENE I,Let fly your venom then.
1844,SCENE I,The Persian empire is in arms. To-night
1845,SCENE I,The king does hold a great carouse. The Jew
1846,SCENE I,Will sit in state beside the profligate.
1847,SCENE I,This blade I have prepared against that hour.
1848,SCENE I,"The queen, I understand, will be a blaze"
1849,SCENE I,Of gems. Ahasuerus boasts this night
1850,SCENE I,Would all but wreck a petty kingdom.
1851,SCENE I,
1852,SCENE I,_Parshandatha_
1853,SCENE I,
1854,SCENE I,He
1855,SCENE I,Should never live to see the rising sun.
1856,SCENE I,
1857,SCENE I,_Zeresh_
1858,SCENE I,
1859,SCENE I,"The rising sun! My dear, he shall not see"
1860,SCENE I,"The Pleiades again, and they are up"
1861,SCENE I,At nine. When cornet and the trumpet bruit
1862,SCENE I,"The entry of the queen, a hundred blades"
1863,SCENE I,Like this [_disclosing dagger_] shall be unsheathed.
1864,SCENE I,"Parshandatha,"
1865,SCENE I,You know whose blood my blade shall drink!
1866,SCENE I,"My hour has come! Ah, Esther, you shall sup"
1867,SCENE I,"Once more with Haman and your drunken lord,"
1868,SCENE I,While Zeresh keeps her lonely watch
1869,SCENE I,"Beneath the silent, glittering stars. Come on!"
1870,SCENE I,
1871,SCENE I,[_Exeunt Zeresh and Parshandatha._]
1872,SCENE I,

1876,SCENE II,SCENE II
1877,SCENE II,
1878,SCENE II,"Place--Outer hall to throne room, curtain back."
1879,SCENE II,
1880,SCENE II,Time--The following evening.
1881,SCENE II,
1882,SCENE II,[_Enter Vashti and Esther from opposite sides of the stage._]
1883,SCENE II,
1884,SCENE II,_Esther_
1885,SCENE II,
1886,SCENE II,"Ah, here already, Vashti, at my poor"
1887,SCENE II,"Request, who dared defy a despot king's"
1888,SCENE II,Command to come before him and his lords?
1889,SCENE II,"Your beauty, radiant and spotless, grows"
1890,SCENE II,Each hour of exiled life more potent still
1891,SCENE II,"Than when it hurled an oriental crown,"
1892,SCENE II,"With all its flashing jewels, in the face"
1893,SCENE II,Of brutal Xerxes rather than unveil
1894,SCENE II,Unto a drunken court of lustful eyes.
1895,SCENE II,"Uncrowned, deposed, you are, yet thrice a queen!"
1896,SCENE II,
1897,SCENE II,_Vashti_
1898,SCENE II,
1899,SCENE II,"The sting, the sting of your envenomed words!"
1900,SCENE II,
1901,SCENE II,_Esther_
1902,SCENE II,
1903,SCENE II,"Forgive me, dear, I do not mock your fate;"
1904,SCENE II,No word of mine is spoke in scorn. I would
1905,SCENE II,Exchange the royal robe and crown I wear
1906,SCENE II,For just one hour of virtuous freedom that
1907,SCENE II,Belongs to you.
1908,SCENE II,
1909,SCENE II,_Vashti_
1910,SCENE II,
1911,SCENE II,I can not understand!
1912,SCENE II,
1913,SCENE II,_Esther_
1914,SCENE II,
1915,SCENE II,"I know; 'tis my misfortune, and I called"
1916,SCENE II,You to the palace that I might explain.
1917,SCENE II,Yet every word seems cruel mockery.
1918,SCENE II,"I do not blame you that your cheek, as chaste"
1919,SCENE II,"As lilies, blushes at my seeming shame."
1920,SCENE II,"Yet, Vashti, can you not believe I need"
1921,SCENE II,Your sympathy? I crave your high respect?
1922,SCENE II,
1923,SCENE II,_Vashti_
1924,SCENE II,
1925,SCENE II,You must an explanation.
1926,SCENE II,
1927,SCENE II,_Esther_
1928,SCENE II,
1929,SCENE II,"Well, did you"
1930,SCENE II,Not sacrifice a queenship for the gem
1931,SCENE II,That every woman holds above a throne?
1932,SCENE II,How can we estimate your loss? The pomp
1933,SCENE II,That follows majesty; the crooking knee;
1934,SCENE II,Ten thousand minions at your beck and call;
1935,SCENE II,"A thousand sycophantic, fawning lords;"
1936,SCENE II,A hundred gleaming jeweled chandeliers;
1937,SCENE II,The radiance and rich magnificence
1938,SCENE II,Of court; long hours of revel and of wine;
1939,SCENE II,And then above the splendor and the show
1940,SCENE II,God's finger writing on the wall! Is this
1941,SCENE II,The precious price that you have paid?
1942,SCENE II,
1943,SCENE II,_Vashti_
1944,SCENE II,
1945,SCENE II,This is
1946,SCENE II,The price.
1947,SCENE II,
1948,SCENE II,_Esther_
1949,SCENE II,
1950,SCENE II,"Sweet friend, I thank you. Yes, your loss"
1951,SCENE II,Has been my gain! Yet what reward have I?
1952,SCENE II,How I do hate the crown that you did spurn!
1953,SCENE II,O how I love the pearl of greatest price!
1954,SCENE II,God pardon my great sin!
1955,SCENE II,
1956,SCENE II,"Vashti, I am"
1957,SCENE II,A daughter of Rebecca and the blood
1958,SCENE II,Of Rachel pulses in my veins! Beyond
1959,SCENE II,"The northern hills, within a valley green,"
1960,SCENE II,A shepherd watches o'er his flocks to-night
1961,SCENE II,"Beside a starlit stream, and dreams of her"
1962,SCENE II,Who gave the promise of her hand when life
1963,SCENE II,Was young and all the earth was pure and fair.
1964,SCENE II,
1965,SCENE II,"His love was constant as the northern star,"
1966,SCENE II,And mine was like the needle pointing true.
1967,SCENE II,That day is but a sad remembrance now.
1968,SCENE II,I never knew the ones who gave me life.
1969,SCENE II,"My uncle, Mordecai, who sits in state"
1970,SCENE II,Beside the king instructed me in love
1971,SCENE II,"And knowledge of my people. Every night,"
1972,SCENE II,"As well as every day, like Daniel, I"
1973,SCENE II,"Was taught to pray, my window open toward"
1974,SCENE II,Jerusalem. God softened Cyrus' heart
1975,SCENE II,"Because of Daniel's prayer. But, Vashti, you"
1976,SCENE II,"Must know from Persian Gulf to Caspian Sea,"
1977,SCENE II,The sons of Jacob still in exile groan
1978,SCENE II,Beneath a tyrant's yoke. I hear the wail
1979,SCENE II,Of Rachel weeping for her children still;
1980,SCENE II,"I hear my lover playing on his flute,"
1981,SCENE II,Who waits the coming of a faithless bride!
1982,SCENE II,_But Mordecai has stayed the hand of Death!_
1983,SCENE II,
1984,SCENE II,_Vashti_
1985,SCENE II,
1986,SCENE II,And you did eat your heart to save your blood?
1987,SCENE II,
1988,SCENE II,_Esther_
1989,SCENE II,
1990,SCENE II,"You comprehend at last? Your sympathy,"
1991,SCENE II,"O Vashti, I must have, if not respect,"
1992,SCENE II,Else can I not return unto the king.      [_Vashti weeps._]
1993,SCENE II,"There, there, I thank you, sister, friend, proud queen!"
1994,SCENE II,The tears that glitter on your cheeks are worth
1995,SCENE II,A diadem of sparkling Indian stones.
1996,SCENE II,But weep no more--your hand--for Esther's heart
1997,SCENE II,"Can now endure, since Vashti understands!"
1998,SCENE II,The stars are twinkling in the northern skies;
1999,SCENE II,They shimmer on the stream beyond the hills;
2000,SCENE II,The shepherd's reed is wailing on the breeze;
2001,SCENE II,The revels in the palace now begin;
2002,SCENE II,The call has come; I must no longer stay.
2003,SCENE II,The daughter of a Benjamite will lay
2004,SCENE II,Her heart upon the altar of her blood.
2005,SCENE II,Hear you the crimson riot in my veins?
2006,SCENE II,'Tis Rachel's voice! I would that you could know!
2007,SCENE II,.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
2008,SCENE II,"Forgive me, Vashti, for my brain's distraught!"
2009,SCENE II,
2010,SCENE II,The lights die out beyond the palace walls.
2011,SCENE II,The stars are hid.... I can no longer hear
2012,SCENE II,The wailing flute.... Return unto your hut.
2013,SCENE II,Ahasuerus calls with mantling wine.
2014,SCENE II,My place is yonder by the king. I go!
2015,SCENE II,
2016,SCENE II,[_Exeunt Esther and Vashti._]
2017,SCENE II,
2018,SCENE II,[_Enter Ahafid and Smerdis._]
2019,SCENE II,
2020,SCENE II,_Ahafid_
2021,SCENE II,
2022,SCENE II,The last word has been spoken
2023,SCENE II,The last true song been sung;
2024,SCENE II,"My country's heart is broken,"
2025,SCENE II,The poet's harp unstrung.
2026,SCENE II,
2027,SCENE II,_Smerdis_
2028,SCENE II,
2029,SCENE II,Ahafid seems to harp upon his strings.
2030,SCENE II,
2031,SCENE II,_Ahafid_
2032,SCENE II,
2033,SCENE II,It seems Ahasuerus means to drink
2034,SCENE II,The cup of revel to its bitter lees.
2035,SCENE II,
2036,SCENE II,_Smerdis_
2037,SCENE II,
2038,SCENE II,The deeper in the cup he goes
2039,SCENE II,The sweeter is the wine that flows;
2040,SCENE II,"The closer to the lees, he thinks,"
2041,SCENE II,The purer is the wine he drinks.
2042,SCENE II,
2043,SCENE II,_Ahafid_
2044,SCENE II,
2045,SCENE II,Messengers from every province bring
2046,SCENE II,Reports of mutterings and dangerous
2047,SCENE II,"Revolt. But Xerxes, heedless still, declares"
2048,SCENE II,This night shall dim the glories of the past.
2049,SCENE II,
2050,SCENE II,_Smerdis_
2051,SCENE II,
2052,SCENE II,[_Sings._]
2053,SCENE II,
2054,SCENE II,The lower in the lamp the oil
2055,SCENE II,The fewer are the days of toil.
2056,SCENE II,"The brighter burns the wick of life,"
2057,SCENE II,The sooner end the days of strife.
2058,SCENE II,"'Tis not for oil that Xerxes cares,"
2059,SCENE II,But brilliancy of flame that flares.
2060,SCENE II,
2061,SCENE II,_Ahafid_
2062,SCENE II,
2063,SCENE II,I hate the Hebrews and their Jewish God;
2064,SCENE II,"I hate Jehovah for his jealous love,"
2065,SCENE II,But Mordecai refuses to attend
2066,SCENE II,The feast. The God of Israel must save
2067,SCENE II,"Us now, or Persia perish utterly."
2068,SCENE II,
2069,SCENE II,My hand will pen no ribald verse
2070,SCENE II,This revel to adorn;
2071,SCENE II,"Ye gods, inspire my tongue to curse"
2072,SCENE II,The day the king was born.
2073,SCENE II,
2074,SCENE II,[_Exit Ahafid._]
2075,SCENE II,
2076,SCENE II,_Smerdis_
2077,SCENE II,
2078,SCENE II,"The more he swears the less he sings,"
2079,SCENE II,Then welcome is this news he brings;
2080,SCENE II,For listening to his song is worse
2081,SCENE II,Than hearing old Ahafid curse.
2082,SCENE II,
2083,SCENE II,[_Exit Smerdis._]
2084,SCENE II,
2085,SCENE II,[_Re-enter Ahafid._]
2086,SCENE II,
2087,SCENE II,_Ahafid_
2088,SCENE II,
2089,SCENE II,[_Sings._]
2090,SCENE II,
2091,SCENE II,"Persia's heart is beating low,"
2092,SCENE II,"Thinking of the long ago,"
2093,SCENE II,When the king that wore the crown
2094,SCENE II,Was a prince of great renown;
2095,SCENE II,When her name without a peer
2096,SCENE II,Did inspire the world with fear;
2097,SCENE II,But to-night her sovereign's lust
2098,SCENE II,Trails her banner in the dust.
2099,SCENE II,
2100,SCENE II,"Now my life is ebbing fast,"
2101,SCENE II,Dreaming of the glorious past;
2102,SCENE II,"Feeling all the shame and smart,"
2103,SCENE II,Dying of a broken heart.
2104,SCENE II,
2105,SCENE II,[_Sinks to floor._]
2106,SCENE II,
2107,SCENE II,[_Curtain._]
2108,SCENE II,
2109,SCENE II,
2110,SCENE III,SCENE III
2111,SCENE III,
2112,SCENE III,[_Curtain rises on Ahasuerus and his court._]
2113,SCENE III,
2114,SCENE III,_Ahasuerus_
2115,SCENE III,
2116,SCENE III,"Sha-ashgaz, keeper of the concubines,"
2117,SCENE III,Ahasuerus drinks your health
2118,SCENE III,And bids you bring immediately before
2119,SCENE III,The court the serpents of the Orient!
2120,SCENE III,The king would have a night of revelry.
2121,SCENE III,
2122,SCENE III,"[_The court fool, Smerdis, dances out before the court._]"
2123,SCENE III,
2124,SCENE III,_Ahasuerus_ (_Continues_)
2125,SCENE III,
2126,SCENE III,"What, Smerdis, is the office of a fool?"
2127,SCENE III,
2128,SCENE III,_Smerdis_
2129,SCENE III,
2130,SCENE III,To charm these serpents of the Orient!
2131,SCENE III,[_Aside_] But more to furnish brains for idiot kings.
2132,SCENE III,
2133,SCENE III,_Ahasuerus_
2134,SCENE III,
2135,SCENE III,Now tell the chief musicians every one
2136,SCENE III,To string his harp with golden wire and tune
2137,SCENE III,His finest Persian reed to touch the heart
2138,SCENE III,"With joy. To-night the emperor of the East,"
2139,SCENE III,The monarch of the world from Babylon
2140,SCENE III,"To India, would show munificence"
2141,SCENE III,Of entertainment never seen within
2142,SCENE III,The palace walls before.
2143,SCENE III,
2144,SCENE III,_Smerdis_
2145,SCENE III,
2146,SCENE III,You do forget
2147,SCENE III,That night six years ago. The palace was
2148,SCENE III,A blaze of light. The air was fragrant with
2149,SCENE III,The breath of spice from off the Indian seas.
2150,SCENE III,"Ahasuerus, flushed with flattery"
2151,SCENE III,"And wine, was mad with passion...."
2152,SCENE III,
2153,SCENE III,_Ahasuerus_
2154,SCENE III,
2155,SCENE III,[_Impetuously._]
2156,SCENE III,
2157,SCENE III,"Smerdis, charm"
2158,SCENE III,"These serpents, if you will, your glittering words"
2159,SCENE III,"Are meaningless to me. Carshena, let"
2160,SCENE III,"The Jewish Esther come in Tyrian robe,"
2161,SCENE III,In such a gown as never Vashti wore!
2162,SCENE III,
2163,SCENE III,_Smerdis_
2164,SCENE III,
2165,SCENE III,[_Aside._]
2166,SCENE III,
2167,SCENE III,His orders have not always been obeyed.
2168,SCENE III,
2169,SCENE III,_Ahasuerus_
2170,SCENE III,
2171,SCENE III,"And I would have my queen adorned with gems,"
2172,SCENE III,"That diamond cluster from beyond the Ind,"
2173,SCENE III,"Which, sparkling in her aureole of gold, bedims"
2174,SCENE III,The constellation of the Southern Cross.
2175,SCENE III,
2176,SCENE III,_Smerdis_
2177,SCENE III,
2178,SCENE III,[_Aside._]
2179,SCENE III,
2180,SCENE III,And makes the Persian peasants mourn their loss!
2181,SCENE III,
2182,SCENE III,_Ahasuerus_
2183,SCENE III,
2184,SCENE III,"I say, Meheuman, this shall be a night"
2185,SCENE III,In which Ahasuerus feasts his friends--
2186,SCENE III,"A banquet for the soul, as well as flesh."
2187,SCENE III,
2188,SCENE III,_Smerdis_
2189,SCENE III,
2190,SCENE III,[_Aside._]
2191,SCENE III,
2192,SCENE III,A famished soul such feasting would refresh!
2193,SCENE III,
2194,SCENE III,_Ahasuerus_
2195,SCENE III,
2196,SCENE III,For who does not delight to look upon
2197,SCENE III,The rhythmic beauty of voluptuous form?
2198,SCENE III,
2199,SCENE III,_Smerdis_
2200,SCENE III,
2201,SCENE III,[_Aside._]
2202,SCENE III,
2203,SCENE III,Cold-blooded heart a writhing snake can warm!
2204,SCENE III,
2205,SCENE III,_Ahasuerus_
2206,SCENE III,
2207,SCENE III,"Whose ear is not enthralled by luscious lute,"
2208,SCENE III,Whose heart is not inspired by festive song!
2209,SCENE III,
2210,SCENE III,_Smerdis_
2211,SCENE III,
2212,SCENE III,[_Aside._]
2213,SCENE III,
2214,SCENE III,The one bowed down by tyranny and wrong!
2215,SCENE III,
2216,SCENE III,_Ahasuerus_
2217,SCENE III,
2218,SCENE III,But why has Mordecai delayed to come?
2219,SCENE III,The hated sons of Haman are no more;
2220,SCENE III,That reprobate who would have slain the queen
2221,SCENE III,Herself to gratify his wounded pride
2222,SCENE III,Has long since festered in the rain and sun.
2223,SCENE III,No enemy remains alive who dares
2224,SCENE III,To touch the people of the Jew that saved
2225,SCENE III,The life of Persia's king. He wears my ring;
2226,SCENE III,The purple of my empire is a shield
2227,SCENE III,Against the world. I do not understand
2228,SCENE III,Why Mordecai is late. He should be here;
2229,SCENE III,The tabor and tymbrel sound anon.
2230,SCENE III,
2231,SCENE III,_Smerdis_
2232,SCENE III,
2233,SCENE III,"[_Dances and capers before the king, then speaks"
2234,SCENE III,solemnly._]
2235,SCENE III,
2236,SCENE III,"O king, I know why Mordecai is late,"
2237,SCENE III,"He sits once more beside the palace gate,"
2238,SCENE III,In sackcloth and bemoans his fate.
2239,SCENE III,He sits and dreams of hills and streams
2240,SCENE III,That flow through pasture lands and fields.
2241,SCENE III,"He sees a child of golden hair,"
2242,SCENE III,"As happy as the vibrant air,"
2243,SCENE III,And hears the notes and pulse of song
2244,SCENE III,Where birds and sheep and shepherds throng.
2245,SCENE III,And then he turns to banquet halls
2246,SCENE III,"And scenes like this in palace walls,"
2247,SCENE III,"Where lords and queens and fools and kings,"
2248,SCENE III,"And concubines and underlings,"
2249,SCENE III,"Made one with wine and passion's thrall,"
2250,SCENE III,"Throw dice with Death, nor heed the call"
2251,SCENE III,"That comes from Persia's bleeding heart,"
2252,SCENE III,[_Aside_] (A fool that can not play his part).
2253,SCENE III,"And this explains why he is late,"
2254,SCENE III,The Jew beside the palace gate.
2255,SCENE III,
2256,SCENE III,_Ahasuerus_
2257,SCENE III,
2258,SCENE III,"You are a jester, not a bard. Your cap"
2259,SCENE III,"And bells, or else Death wins his throw with you."
2260,SCENE III,"Meheuman, call the poet of the court,"
2261,SCENE III,The great Ahafid. Let him celebrate
2262,SCENE III,This feast in song. This rhyming fool presumes
2263,SCENE III,Too much upon the patience of the king.
2264,SCENE III,
2265,SCENE III,_Smerdis_
2266,SCENE III,
2267,SCENE III,"Your majesty, I did but rhyme because"
2268,SCENE III,Ahafid's dead.
2269,SCENE III,
2270,SCENE III,_Ahasuerus_
2271,SCENE III,
2272,SCENE III,Ahafid dead? What caused
2273,SCENE III,His death?
2274,SCENE III,
2275,SCENE III,_Smerdis_
2276,SCENE III,
2277,SCENE III,[_Aside._]
2278,SCENE III,
2279,SCENE III,A broken heart. [_Aloud._] He broke his harp
2280,SCENE III,And died of grief. [_Aside again._] The good gray poet could
2281,SCENE III,Remember real kings.
2282,SCENE III,
2283,SCENE III,_Ahasuerus_
2284,SCENE III,
2285,SCENE III,Of grief? The fool!
2286,SCENE III,"Well, let the younger minstrel, Saadi sing."
2287,SCENE III,
2288,SCENE III,_Saadi_
2289,SCENE III,
2290,SCENE III,[_Sings._]
2291,SCENE III,
2292,SCENE III,"Lift the voice and let us sing,"
2293,SCENE III,The monarch's on his throne;
2294,SCENE III,Xerxes is the greatest king
2295,SCENE III,The world has ever known.
2296,SCENE III,"Women, wine and happy song,"
2297,SCENE III,"Let the revels ring,"
2298,SCENE III,"Lift your voices loud and long,"
2299,SCENE III,For Xerxes is our king.
2300,SCENE III,
2301,SCENE III,[_Much revel and dancing. The trumpet sounds._]
2302,SCENE III,
2303,SCENE III,_Ahasuerus_
2304,SCENE III,
2305,SCENE III,Ahafid's death was only Persia's gain.
2306,SCENE III,
2307,SCENE III,[_Meditatively._]
2308,SCENE III,
2309,SCENE III,Could Vashti look upon this gorgeous scene
2310,SCENE III,The bitter tears would scald her faded cheeks
2311,SCENE III,At thoughts of her own folly.
2312,SCENE III,
2313,SCENE III,"[_Confusion and much disturbance. Ahasuerus, surprised,"
2314,SCENE III,cries in angry passion._]
2315,SCENE III,
2316,SCENE III,Ho! What means
2317,SCENE III,This rude confusion? Who has dared disturb
2318,SCENE III,The king in this unwonted way?
2319,SCENE III,
2320,SCENE III,[_Enter messenger._]
2321,SCENE III,
2322,SCENE III,_Messenger_
2323,SCENE III,
2324,SCENE III,"Tidings,"
2325,SCENE III,"O king, of riot and revolt!"
2326,SCENE III,
2327,SCENE III,_Ahasuerus_
2328,SCENE III,
2329,SCENE III,Restore
2330,SCENE III,The court to order. I will hear no news!
2331,SCENE III,There is no news but this night's joy. What fear
2332,SCENE III,Need Persia have? The world is safe;
2333,SCENE III,The emperor lives! Go put the messengers to death!
2334,SCENE III,This is no time to cloud the royal brow!
2335,SCENE III,Bring forth the vintage from the deepest vault.
2336,SCENE III,Here are a hundred irised pearls. They cost
2337,SCENE III,A million sesterces. Let each man crush
2338,SCENE III,A lustrous shell and drink it to the health
2339,SCENE III,"Of Esther, beauteous queen of all the East."
2340,SCENE III,Arise! She comes! A blaze of splendor. Now
2341,SCENE III,Let every instrument be sounded.
2342,SCENE III,The revels shall continue till the dawn!
2343,SCENE III,
2344,SCENE III,_Zeresh_
2345,SCENE III,
2346,SCENE III,[_Rushing in with uplifted dagger and thrusting it into
2347,SCENE III,"the heart of Esther, crying as she flourishes it before"
2348,SCENE III,the astonished court._]
2349,SCENE III,
2350,SCENE III,"The dawn, O king, is breaking in the east!"

2393,THE OLD DOG IRONS,
2394,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"Oh, the old, old dog irons! How the picture thrills my soul,"
2395,THE OLD DOG IRONS,As I stir the ashes of the past and find this living coal:
2396,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"When I blow the breath of memory it flashes into flame,"
2397,THE OLD DOG IRONS,That seems to me far brighter than the most undying fame.
2398,THE OLD DOG IRONS,Will you listen to the story of my early childhood days
2399,THE OLD DOG IRONS,When I read the mystic symbols in the embers and the blaze
2400,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"Of the old wide-open fireplace, where the backlog, all aglow"
2401,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"With its shifting scenes of fancy, was a motion picture show?"
2402,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"I know about your natural gas, your stoves and anthracite,"
2403,THE OLD DOG IRONS,Your phonograph and telephone and incandescent light;
2404,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"I've heard about the comforts and the use of gasoline,"
2405,THE OLD DOG IRONS,And the educative value of a Pathe photo-scene;
2406,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"The future of the biplane and the wonders of the press,"
2407,THE OLD DOG IRONS,And the blessings of the wireless when a ship is in distress.
2408,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"I marvel at invention and its all but magic art,"
2409,THE OLD DOG IRONS,But the things that make for happiness concern the human heart.
2410,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"Then why not praise the tallow dip, the dog irons and the crane,"
2411,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"The kettle singing on the coals, or hanging to a chain?"
2412,THE OLD DOG IRONS,The children gathered round the hearth to hear of early days--
2413,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"The wildcat and the panther, the redman's sneaking ways;"
2414,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"The bravery of our fathers, the scalping knife and gun,"
2415,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"The courage of the women folks; I tell you, boys, 'twas fun."
2416,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"We roasted sweet potatoes and we talked of Marion's men,"
2417,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"How they routed all the redcoats, or slew them in the fen."
2418,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"We learned to love our country and we swore to tell the truth,"
2419,THE OLD DOG IRONS,And do no deed of treachery and never act uncouth;
2420,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"To guard the honor of our name, and shield a virtuous home,"
2421,THE OLD DOG IRONS,To read the Proverbs and the Psalms and love the sacred tome.
2422,THE OLD DOG IRONS,I know our home was humble then--rag carpet on the floor--
2423,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"But the stranger found a welcome there, the latch-string on the door."
2424,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"The well-sweep and the woodpile and the ox team in the shed,"
2425,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"Dried apples hung around the walls, and pumpkins overhead--"
2426,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"Not sanitary, I'll admit, nor stylish-like, nor rich,"
2427,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"But health and comfort and content; now tell me, which is which?"
2428,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"Then who can blame me that I love the good old dog iron days,"
2429,THE OLD DOG IRONS,When men had hearts and character that fortune couldn't faze;
2430,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"The years before the slitted skirts and the Turkish cigarettes,"
2431,THE OLD DOG IRONS,When women wove their linsey clothes instead of devilish nets;
2432,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"When children did the chores at night, nor ever heard of gym,"
2433,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"Or movements such as boy scouts, yet kept in health and trim."
2434,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"We spent our evenings all at home, and read and sang and played,"
2435,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"Or talked of work and feats of strength, or what our crops had made;"
2436,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"And when we mentioned quilting bees and apple-peeling time,"
2437,THE OLD DOG IRONS,We had in mind our sweethearts and we sometimes made a rhyme:
2438,THE OLD DOG IRONS,"'Twas then I read my future in the embers and the blaze,"
2439,THE OLD DOG IRONS,And this is why I celebrate the good old dog iron ways.

2501,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,
2502,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"Ah, Grandmother Young was wrinkled and old"
2503,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,When she sat by the mantelpiece;
2504,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,And she wore a cap with many a fold
2505,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"Of ribbon and lace, as rich as gold,"
2506,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,And worked in many a crease:
2507,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,And the billowy clouds of smoke that rolled
2508,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,From her little stone pipe whenever she told
2509,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"Of the quest of the Golden Fleece,"
2510,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,Wrought me to think that Grandmother Young
2511,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,Was shriveled and gray when Homer sung
2512,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,Of the gods of ancient Greece.
2513,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,
2514,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,But all of her marvelous mythical lore
2515,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,Was naught to her magical power--
2516,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,Transforming a house with a puncheon floor
2517,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,To a palace of wealth with a golden door
2518,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,That lead to a castle tower--
2519,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,An attic loft with a wonderful store
2520,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"Of things that we feared, but longed to explore--"
2521,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,Our grandmother's ancient dower.
2522,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"Oh, grandmother's charm could change but a base"
2523,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"Rude vessel of clay to a Haviland vase,"
2524,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,A weed to a royal flower.
2525,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,
2526,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"Ah, grandmother's home was a temple of grace"
2527,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"And my child-heart worshipped there,"
2528,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"When Balm-of-Gilead around the place,"
2529,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"Like incense, for a mile of space,"
2530,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,Perfumed the glorious air;
2531,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,And the song that came from the feathered race
2532,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,In the boughs of the tangled interlace
2533,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"Of apple and peach and pear,"
2534,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,Enthralled me like the magic spell
2535,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,Of siren music when it fell
2536,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,On old Ulysses' ear.
2537,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,
2538,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,Last summer I passed where the palace once stood
2539,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,Whose beauty my life beguiled;
2540,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,It's a cabin now; and the charmed wood
2541,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"Of sugar and oak, in brotherhood"
2542,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"Of walnut and hickory, aisled"
2543,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,For gathering nuts and the merry mood
2544,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"That only our childhood understood,"
2545,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,By man has been defiled.
2546,GRANDMOTHER DAYS,"Oh, how can I ever cease to praise"

2586,AMNEMON,"""Dear, the struggle has been hard and long--"
2587,AMNEMON,"The wine-press I have trodden,"
2588,AMNEMON,Paved with flint and shard;
2589,AMNEMON,And many times my feet have stained
2590,AMNEMON,The flagstones of the street with blood.
2591,AMNEMON,Out yonder in the park where life's rich chalice
2592,AMNEMON,Sparkles with the wine of happiness and love
2593,AMNEMON,The world was always dull and dark to me.
2594,AMNEMON,Hours I have stood upon the beach
2595,AMNEMON,And watched the whitecaps glinting
2596,AMNEMON,In the sunlight and listened to the breakers
2597,AMNEMON,"Booming on the sinuous shore,"
2598,AMNEMON,While little children clapped their hands
2599,AMNEMON,"And shouted out across the waters,"
2600,AMNEMON,And gray-haired men and women shook their heads
2601,AMNEMON,In silence and looked toward the sunset.
2602,AMNEMON,But everything was always meaningless to me.
2603,AMNEMON,Season after season I have watched the butterflies
2604,AMNEMON,By millions come and go
2605,AMNEMON,And katydids each year have sung
2606,AMNEMON,The song monotonous and passed away.
2607,AMNEMON,Yesterday the sun arose upon another world.
2608,AMNEMON,Gray skies have turned to brilliant blue;
2609,AMNEMON,The droning hum of beetles on the breeze
2610,AMNEMON,Is like an orchestra of lovely music.
2611,AMNEMON,The air is sweet and fresh as dewdrops in convolvuli.
2612,AMNEMON,For two bright hours I have strolled
2613,AMNEMON,"Among the flowering shrubbery near the seashore,"
2614,AMNEMON,Listening to a song I had not heard for years.
2615,AMNEMON,"And now once more that I am happy,"
2616,AMNEMON,May I not confess it all?
2617,AMNEMON,"I did you wrong, great wrong."
2618,AMNEMON,"There was no stain upon my life,"
2619,AMNEMON,No taint of blood within my veins.
2620,AMNEMON,"I came of Pilgrim stock, vigorous and strong."
2621,AMNEMON,"I did not understand my heart,"
2622,AMNEMON,"And knowing all the stress you placed upon heredity,"
2623,AMNEMON,"I told a falsehood, partly as a test of love,"
2624,AMNEMON,And part for self-protection.
2625,AMNEMON,"I have suffered much, but justly."
2626,AMNEMON,"You said my story broke your heart,"
2627,AMNEMON,"And left me where I stood,"
2628,AMNEMON,Pondering on the sin I had committed.
2629,AMNEMON,"I had proved your love, but all too late."
2630,AMNEMON,"Your talent meant a brilliant future,"
2631,AMNEMON,And I knew your great ambition.
2632,AMNEMON,For years I scanned the periodicals
2633,AMNEMON,"Where names of most renown in literature are found,"
2634,AMNEMON,"Expecting always to see my lover's there,"
2635,AMNEMON,But always doomed to disappointment.
2636,AMNEMON,And yet I now rejoice
2637,AMNEMON,"That you have not achieved great fame,"
2638,AMNEMON,For otherwise I could not write this letter.
2639,AMNEMON,Perhaps 'twere best that I should never send it;
2640,AMNEMON,"If so, it will not find its way to you."
2641,AMNEMON,"It may be that you think me dead,"
2642,AMNEMON,Or worse--I may have been forgotten.
2643,AMNEMON,This is April twenty-first;
2644,AMNEMON,The hillsides now are pink with peach and apple bloom.
2645,AMNEMON,"I will arrive in Salt Lake City, May the third,"
2646,AMNEMON,And be at Hotel Utah.

2651,AMNEMON,Alfred Milner read this letter
2652,AMNEMON,While great drops of perspiration
2653,AMNEMON,Stood upon his brow and trembling hand.
2654,AMNEMON,For seven winters he had tried
2655,AMNEMON,To bury in oblivion a face and form
2656,AMNEMON,That always with the dogwood blossoms
2657,AMNEMON,"Came again, and each time seemed more fair."
2658,AMNEMON,He had tried for fame and failed.
2659,AMNEMON,But now his book that bore a pen name only
2660,AMNEMON,Was selling daily by the thousands
2661,AMNEMON,"And fame and fortune, latter-day twin saints,"
2662,AMNEMON,Were building him a shrine.
2663,AMNEMON,"But did she know of his success,"
2664,AMNEMON,And was her conduct
2665,AMNEMON,Years before base cowardice?
2666,AMNEMON,Had she only told the cruel tale
2667,AMNEMON,"Because she knew his theory of insane blood,"
2668,AMNEMON,And hid her lack of faith
2669,AMNEMON,By taking refuge in his prejudice?
2670,AMNEMON,Or was her story true?
2671,AMNEMON,"If true or false, why had she kept it back"
2672,AMNEMON,Until she knew red passion
2673,AMNEMON,Was a-riot in his heart?
2674,AMNEMON,He tore the letter into strips
2675,AMNEMON,And blew them fiercely through the air.
2676,AMNEMON,"He had suffered much himself,"
2677,AMNEMON,But she was not concerned.
2678,AMNEMON,What if this letter had been sent
2679,AMNEMON,"To open healing wounds,"
2680,AMNEMON,To win some wager with another man
2681,AMNEMON,To whom she boasted of her power?
2682,AMNEMON,He would not go!
2683,AMNEMON,
2684,AMNEMON,The air was growing foul and stuffy
2685,AMNEMON,"In his suite of rooms,"
2686,AMNEMON,And Alfred threw the window open.
2687,AMNEMON,The subway in the distance
2688,AMNEMON,Rumbled like a gathering storm;
2689,AMNEMON,The palisades across the Hudson
2690,AMNEMON,Now were darkling in the falling shadows.
2691,AMNEMON,
2692,AMNEMON,April thirtieth at noon.
2693,AMNEMON,The Rocky Mountains looked like towers
2694,AMNEMON,On the Chinese Wall a hundred miles away.
2695,AMNEMON,Would he make connection at Pueblo?
2696,AMNEMON,The gray monotony of grass and cacti
2697,AMNEMON,Had begun to wear upon his nerves.
2698,AMNEMON,He longed to see the Royal Gorge--
2699,AMNEMON,The steep and jagged heights of hills.
2700,AMNEMON,They spoke of giant strength
2701,AMNEMON,He needed for the coming struggle.
2702,AMNEMON,It might be that the air
2703,AMNEMON,From off eternal snows
2704,AMNEMON,Would cool the fever in his brain.
2705,AMNEMON,
2706,AMNEMON,"""May second, and yonder lies the Great Salt Lake,"
2707,AMNEMON,"Or else a mirage on the desert's rim."""
2708,AMNEMON,
2709,AMNEMON,Alfred put his pen upon the register
2710,AMNEMON,"Of Hotel Utah,"
2711,AMNEMON,And read the list of names above.
2712,AMNEMON,"She was there, ""Geraldine Mahaffy."""
2713,AMNEMON,"Finally he scrawled a signature,"
2714,AMNEMON,But wrote his _nom de plume_.
2715,AMNEMON,The clerk thrust out his hand and beamed.
2716,AMNEMON,"Two porters swooped upon his grips,"
2717,AMNEMON,And soon the lobby hummed.
2718,AMNEMON,But Alfred Milner sat alone within his room
2719,AMNEMON,Battling with emotions he could neither
2720,AMNEMON,Overcome nor understand.
2721,AMNEMON,He did not know the stir his name upon the register
2722,AMNEMON,"Had made below, or knew what name he wrote."
2723,AMNEMON,"At last: ""Geraldine Mahaffy:"
2724,AMNEMON,"This is May the third and I am here."""
2725,AMNEMON,Thoughtfully he creased the sheet
2726,AMNEMON,"And rang: ""Room ten, and answer, please."""
2727,AMNEMON,
2728,AMNEMON,The smell of brine was heavy on the air
2729,AMNEMON,That blew across the lake.
2730,AMNEMON,The mountains to the north were white with snow above
2731,AMNEMON,And dogwood petals on the southern slopes.
2732,AMNEMON,"But winter was forgotten in the plains,"
2733,AMNEMON,For rivulets imprisoned long in cataracts
2734,AMNEMON,Were leaping over waterfalls
2735,AMNEMON,"And shouting like a red bird,"
2736,AMNEMON,In an April cedar tree.
2737,AMNEMON,
2738,AMNEMON,Milner drew a long deep breath of spring

2774,AMNEMON,A hundred waterfalls were visible

2778,AMNEMON,Upon a sea of emerald;

2781,AMNEMON,"Over to the right the Cornell towers,"
2782,AMNEMON,"Like mediæval castles beetling o'er the precipice,"
2783,AMNEMON,Were keeping silent watch above it all.

2796,AMNEMON,Slowly like a giant serpent
2797,AMNEMON,The Sunset Limited climbed the great Sierras
2798,AMNEMON,And started down the western slope at dawn.

2800,AMNEMON,Never bloomed so beautiful before.
2801,AMNEMON,The blue Pacific through the haze
2802,AMNEMON,Was like a canvas sea.

2836,AMNEMON,
2837,AMNEMON,The _City Argentina_ blew a long loud blast
2838,AMNEMON,And anchored in the bay.
2839,AMNEMON,The woman opened wondering eyes
2840,AMNEMON,And looked at Milner.
2841,AMNEMON,"""Why do you call me Geraldine?"
2842,AMNEMON,My Christian name's Amnemon.
2843,AMNEMON,We never met before.
2844,AMNEMON,I am Major Erskine's wife.
2845,AMNEMON,We live in Pasadena.
2846,AMNEMON,"I do not know your name or face,"
2847,AMNEMON,Nor how I came to be with you.
2848,AMNEMON,"I never saw this place before,"
2849,AMNEMON,But those are California hills
2850,AMNEMON,And yonder is the great Pacific.
2851,AMNEMON,"The mystery of who you are,"
2852,AMNEMON,"And where I am, I can not solve."
2853,AMNEMON,I only know I wish to see my home and child;
2854,AMNEMON,"Little Alfred never has been left alone,"
2855,AMNEMON,And may be calling for his mother now.
2856,AMNEMON,You seem to be a gentleman.
2857,AMNEMON,Please show me to the nearest train
2858,AMNEMON,"That goes to Pasadena."""
2859,AMNEMON,
2860,AMNEMON,Half in fright and half in rage
2861,AMNEMON,Milner looked at Geraldine and tried to speak.
2862,AMNEMON,The mountains reeled and pitched into the sea.
2863,AMNEMON,A clevage in the brain! But whose?
2864,AMNEMON,"This was insanity, but whether his"
2865,AMNEMON,Or hers he was unable to decide.
2866,AMNEMON,The memory of the Cornell days came back--
2867,AMNEMON,"The cliffs above the lake, the emerald farms,"
2868,AMNEMON,"The gorges and the waterfalls,"
2869,AMNEMON,"And finally the wild, weird light"
2870,AMNEMON,That played in iridescent eyes
2871,AMNEMON,That last day on the hills--
2872,AMNEMON,The story of the tainted blood and what it meant
2873,AMNEMON,For future generations.
2874,AMNEMON,Milner saw an eagle soaring high above the park
2875,AMNEMON,And then he heard a scream
2876,AMNEMON,As though a ball had pierced its heart.
2877,AMNEMON,"The bird careened and dropped a hundred feet,"
2878,AMNEMON,"Then spreading broad its wings again,"
2879,AMNEMON,Shot upward to the heights.
2880,AMNEMON,
2881,AMNEMON,The train for Pasadena speeded onward
2882,AMNEMON,Toward its destination.
2883,AMNEMON,A poet sat within his room
2884,AMNEMON,That opened on the Golden Gate
2885,AMNEMON,"And as the sun dropped into the wave,"
2886,AMNEMON,"He wrote a Requiem to Hope,"
2887,AMNEMON,That filled the earth with fame.

2890,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND
2891,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,
2892,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Early in the day they passed the pinnacle,"
2893,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,And now the shadow of each human form
2894,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Was lengthening backwards like Lombardy poplars
2895,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Fallen toward the east.
2896,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,For days the fairest maiden of the caravan
2897,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Had fevered--whether from malaria and fatigue,"
2898,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Or more because of one whom they had left behind,"
2899,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Beyond the wooded mountains,"
2900,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Neither sire nor matron could agree.
2901,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"But Martha Waters, as they laid her stretcher down"
2902,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"And prepared the camp for coming night,"
2903,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Declared unless they rested here for days to come,"
2904,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Her bones must bleach beside the trail
2905,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,That led into the Dark and Bloody Ground.
2906,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,
2907,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"And so they waited for the fever to abate,"
2908,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"But when they thought her strong enough,"
2909,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,A score of hardy pioneers trudged down
2910,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,The slope and launched canoes and dug-outs
2911,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,And a flatboat in the turgid waters
2912,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Of the Cumberland, for heavy rains had fallen"
2913,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,And all the mountain streams were swollen
2914,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,In these early days of June.
2915,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,But the air was sweet with the odor
2916,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Of wild honeysuckle and the ivy
2917,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,With its starry clusters fringed
2918,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,The milky way of elder bloom
2919,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,That filled each sheltered cove
2920,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Like constellations on a summer night.
2921,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"But now the rains had ceased, the air"
2922,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Was fresh and bracing, and each glorious day"
2923,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Out-rivaled all the rest in beauty.
2924,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Lying on her pallet on the flatboat,"
2925,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"The maiden breathed the fragrant atmosphere,"
2926,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,And drank refreshing whiffs of air
2927,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,That drove the fever from her blood
2928,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,And wakened dreams of conquest
2929,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,In the wilderness toward which
2930,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Her life was drifting rapidly.
2931,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,But how could she find heart for conquest?
2932,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Why seek this new land anyway, where only"
2933,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,And forever to card the wool and spin the flax
2934,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Would be the woman's portion?
2935,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Would ever in the forest or beyond it
2936,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"In the rolling bluegrass,"
2937,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Return the vision that was hers,"
2938,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,When only a few brief months ago
2939,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,She watched the sea gulls battling with the storm
2940,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Above the waves of Chesapeake Bay?
2941,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Oh, how that day was filled with meaning"
2942,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,For her now! For as the birds disported
2943,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"With the whirlpools of the air,"
2944,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"A lover's magic words were whispered in her ear,"
2945,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,How that storm and stress of life to those that love
2946,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Are little more than winds to swallows of the sea.
2947,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"But now, if hardship meant so little,"
2948,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Why had he remained behind, when she"
2949,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Was forced to go upon the long and weary journey?
2950,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Ah! Could it be he cared no longer for her love?
2951,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,His arm was strong. Then was his heart
2952,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Not brave enough to conquer this new world,"
2953,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Where savage lurked and wild beast made
2954,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,The darkness dreaded by the most courageous soul?
2955,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,
2956,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"For days the fleet had drifted down the river,"
2957,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,But now her boat was anchored to a tree
2958,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"That grew upon an island in the Cumberland,"
2959,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,And every man and woman but the convalescent
2960,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Had gone ashore to stalk a deer or gather berries
2961,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,That everywhere were found along the river bank.
2962,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,But Martha Waters lay upon her bed and pondered--
2963,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Dreaming day dreams, as she watched"
2964,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,A golden oriole who fed her young
2965,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"In boughs that overhung the water,"
2966,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,And a vague unhappiness arose
2967,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Within her heart, until she tossed"
2968,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Again in fever on her couch.
2969,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,She could hear the roaring falls
2970,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"A mile below, but she thought the sounding"
2971,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Cataract the sickness booming in her ears again.
2972,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,When she looked to eastward where the mountain
2973,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Rose a thousand feet, she saw a crown of wealth"
2974,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Upon its crest of which no pioneer yet had dreamed.
2975,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Long she lay and marveled at its beauty,"
2976,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Wondering how many ages would elapse before
2977,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,The god of Mammon would transport its treasures
2978,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,To his marts beside the sea.
2979,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Feverish she mused and pondered until at last she slept.
2980,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"And then upon the little island,"
2981,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,A city rose as from the ocean wave--
2982,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"A city of a thousand streets, and every house"
2983,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Was made from trees that grew upon the mountain.
2984,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Many were the palaces of wealth and beauty,"
2985,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,But those who dwelt therein she did not recognize.
2986,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Strange were their faces and their manners haughty,"
2987,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"And while they lived in luxury and ease,"
2988,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Others toiled at mill and furnace. Oh! The awful din
2989,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Of sledge and hammer, beating in her ears."
2990,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"She woke. A storm seemed just about to burst in fury,"
2991,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,So loud and terrible was the roaring!
2992,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,But the sky was clear. It is the booming
2993,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Of the falls, for her boat has broke its moorings,"
2994,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"And now is rapidly drifting toward the cataract,"
2995,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,But four hundred yards away!
2996,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,
2997,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,She leaped upon her feet and screamed for help.
2998,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"It was impossible for her to swim ashore,"
2999,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,And her fever-wasted frame could find no strength
3000,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,With which to steer the boat.
3001,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Again she saw the crown of wealth
3002,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Upon the mountain top, untouched by human hands."
3003,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"But the island city now had faded from her vision,"
3004,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,The mountain lowered and the world grew dark.
3005,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Onward the boat shot faster toward the roaring falls.
3006,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"But look! A race is on! A birch canoe,"
3007,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Driven by as swift a hand as ever gripped
3008,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"An oar, is leaping o'er the waves in mad pursuit."
3009,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,With every stroke the Indian bark is gaining twenty feet.
3010,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Will it reach the flatboat soon enough to save the girl?
3011,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,But who is he that rides the fleet canoe?
3012,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"No red man ever had an arm like that,"
3013,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"For already he has reached the speeding raft,"
3014,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,And with gigantic strength he steers it toward the shore.
3015,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,But no! The current is too swift!
3016,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,A moment more and all will be engulfed within
3017,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,The swirling flood. It is too late! Too late?
3018,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"But love is swifter than the angry tide,"
3019,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"For like a mighty porpoise, wallowing in the wave,"
3020,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"The valiant hero leaps into the stream,"
3021,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,And holding Martha Waters in his strong right arm
3022,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"High above the water, reaches shore"
3023,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,A hundred feet above the deadly precipice.
3024,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,
3025,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"The air was growing chilly even on this summer night,"
3026,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"And the emigrants had gathered round a crackling fire,"
3027,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Discoursing of the past, and listening to a modest tale of love."
3028,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Simply and unfaltering James Hunt related
3029,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"How his heart had hungered back beside the old Potomac,"
3030,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Till he found he could no longer brook the passion
3031,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,That grew stronger as the days of summer lengthened.
3032,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"At last he started, and following every night"
3033,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"The blazing dogstar, and resting through the day till evening,"
3034,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,In just three weeks he reached the river
3035,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Where he found the birch canoe that rode
3036,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,The seething waters like a greyhound of the ocean.
3037,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Then the maiden told her vision of the island city,"
3038,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"How its palaces and mansions, rich as gold and beautiful as crystal,"
3039,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Were constructed by her people, toiling hundreds,"
3040,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Sore and weary, of times cold and hungry."
3041,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"She had seen them fell the forests,"
3042,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Hew and mill and dress the lumber,"
3043,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Till the soil and reap the harvests, gathering into others' garners."
3044,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Stalwart were these men and women, pure of heart"
3045,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"And strong of muscle, fitted for the tasks before them."
3046,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,She had seen her brothers laboring at the forge and sounding anvil;
3047,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Sisters toiling at the wheel and distaff, heard them at the loom"
3048,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,While flying shuttle threaded warp with web of beauty;
3049,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Watched them till they fell asleep with weariness,"
3050,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,While the sons of leisure feasted.
3051,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Thus the maiden told her story, saying:"
3052,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"""Shall we undertake the journey? Plows are waiting"
3053,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"In the furrows back in Maryland, my people,"
3054,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Back beyond the rugged mountain. There are harvests
3055,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Yet ungarnered, waiting for scythe and sickle."
3056,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Calculate the cost, and weigh it, for my vision is prophetic."
3057,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"For my part, I choose this lover, for my guide and valiant leader."
3058,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"He shall point the way forever,"
3059,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Though he take the road that's darkest."""
3060,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,
3061,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Then James Hunt, the hero lover,"
3062,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Who had never quailed at danger,"
3063,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Trembling for his happy passion,"
3064,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Rose and pointed toward the westward,"
3065,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Toward the Pleiades descending,"
3066,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Deep behind the gloomy forest.
3067,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"""Let us face toward dark Kentucky, fell its forests,"
3068,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Build its roads and bridge its rivers,"
3069,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Give our children to the nation.
3070,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"What though others reap our harvests,"
3071,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Hoard the wealth we have created?
3072,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Ours shall be the nobler portion.
3073,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Blessed is the one that suffers,"
3074,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,If he spends himself for others.
3075,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Should the toiling millions falter,"
3076,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Though they work for others' comfort,"
3077,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Building homes they can not enter?
3078,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Christ was born within a manger,"
3079,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"May we not produce a leader,"
3080,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Who shall save our nation's honor?
3081,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"At to-morrow morning's dawning,"
3082,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Ere the sunrise gild the treetops,"
3083,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Let us take the darkling pathway."""
3084,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,
3085,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Still the Pleiades are circling,"
3086,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Still the dogstar glows in heaven,"
3087,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,But the oak and pine and poplar
3088,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,All have gone from off the mountain--
3089,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Passed into the marts of Mammon,"
3090,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,By the hands of toil and labor.
3091,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"Silent are the loom and distaff,"
3092,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"In the cabin and the cottage,"
3093,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,And the songs of scythe and sickle
3094,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Gathering in the golden harvests.
3095,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"But the pain of drudgery lingers,"
3096,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,And the heart still longs and hungers
3097,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,"For the fruitage it shall gather,"
3098,A ROMANCE OF THE CUMBERLAND,Yet beyond the wooded westward.

3358,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,[_This monologue of Pilate to Herod takes place a few
3359,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,days after the resurrection at the home of Pontius
3360,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Pilate. Pilate and Herod are standing on the east porch
3361,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"of the Governor's mansion in Jerusalem, looking toward"
3362,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,the Mount of Olives. The time is just at sunset._]
3363,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,
3364,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"Oh! Herod, couldst thou find no fault in Him--"
3365,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,The Man of Galilee? Clearly He
3366,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Belonged within thy jurisdiction. Didst
3367,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Thou fear to do thy duty? Still I blame
3368,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Thee not--the mob was clamorous for blood!
3369,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"I questioned Him, but like a lamb before"
3370,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,His shearers He was dumb and answered me
3371,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,No word. Was not His silence proof of guilt?
3372,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,But even then I offered to release
3373,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"Him, till the rabble shouted, ""Crucify"
3374,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"This Man: set free Barabbas, if thou wilt,"
3375,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,But we demand the life of Jesus whom
3376,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"They call the _Christ_."" Oh! dost thou think His blood"
3377,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Can be upon my head? I washed my hands
3378,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Before the multitude and told them I
3379,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Was innocent of any crime toward Him.
3380,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"I scourged Him, it is true, but that was all."
3381,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,They stripped Him and bedecked Him with a robe
3382,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"Of scarlet cloth, and placed a crown of thorns"
3383,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"Upon His head, and then they mocked and jeered"
3384,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"And spat upon Him, hailing Him as _King_!"
3385,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"I can not think that this was right, but still"
3386,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,They say He blasphemed and deserved to die.
3387,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,But what Is blasphemy?
3388,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"Oh, Herod, I"
3389,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Can never rid my dreams of Jesus' look.
3390,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,He turned His eyes upon me as I dipped
3391,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,My fingers in the bowl--a glance that seemed
3392,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,More fraught with love and pity than with hate.
3393,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,He blessed the people as He hung upon
3394,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"The cross in agony of pain, and prayed"
3395,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,His God to pardon them because they knew
3396,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"Not what they did. Thou canst not, Herod, think"
3397,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,This Nazarene was more than man? It can't
3398,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Be possible that He whom Pilate scourged
3399,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Was _Christ_ indeed! But could a _man_ forgive
3400,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,His murderers? They say the tomb is burst
3401,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,And that His body is no longer there!
3402,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,I might endure His curse. My pen has stabbed
3403,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,To death a thousand men and never felt
3404,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"Compunction for the deed, because I knew"
3405,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,They hated me. But now the voice that haunts
3406,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,My sleep asks only blessings on my head.
3407,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"They say He wept for men because of sin,"
3408,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,And yet no guile was found in Him. If I
3409,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Could close my eyes and see that face no more
3410,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,I might find peace again.
3411,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Three nights I have
3412,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Not slept. I hear that Judas hanged himself!
3413,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,And now no guard that watched before
3414,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,The sepulchre can anywhere be found.
3415,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Had I but set the Galilean free!
3416,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,But did he not insult my majesty?
3417,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,He must have known I ruled in Cæsar's stead.
3418,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,What if my wife was troubled in a dream
3419,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,And suffered many things on His account?
3420,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,A Roman governor must be a man!
3421,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,They say the temple's veil was rent in twain--
3422,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,The sky was darkened and the sun was hid.
3423,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,He said I had no power to crucify
3424,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Except that it be given from above.
3425,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,He did not know the strength of Pilate's arm!
3426,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"'Tis said He cried, ""My God, my God, why hast"
3427,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"Thou now forsaken me?"" The earth did quake,"
3428,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"The tombs were cracked, and then the shrouded dead"
3429,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Stalked ghost-like through the fields and open streets!
3430,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Look! Look! What is yon robe of shining white?
3431,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Behold the Man--the Man of Galilee!
3432,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"With outstretched arms He stands on Olivet,"
3433,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,The shadows purpling o'er Gethsemane.
3434,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"I hear Him cry in agony of soul,"
3435,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"""How often would I, O Jerusalem,"
3436,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Have gathered unto Me thy children as
3437,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"A hen her brood beneath her wing, but ye"
3438,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"Would not come."" Herod, canst thou hear His voice?"
3439,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,It is impossible! It can not be!
3440,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,He must not know that I am Pilate! Still
3441,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"He calls my name! I can not, dare not go!"
3442,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,What would the people think? I will
3443,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Be free. There is no blood upon my hands.
3444,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"See, I wash them clean and am myself"
3445,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,Again. Oh! Now the spell is gone. Though not
3446,PILATE'S MONOLOGUE,"The king, I am governor of the Jews!"

3455,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,
3456,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,What is courage? To face the bursting shell
3457,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,When rhythmic sheets of fire discover gulfs
3458,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"Of death, yet rather steel than daunt the heart;"
3459,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"When comrades fall beneath the knapsack's weight,"
3460,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"Foot froze and bleeding on the icy road,"
3461,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,To hear the blasts from towering snow-crowned Alps
3462,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,Sing only martial airs that stir the blood!
3463,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,It is a noble thing to die in war--
3464,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,To sacrifice the breath of life; to feel
3465,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"The pain of hunger and of cold, yet flinch"
3466,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,Not that one's country may be great or free.
3467,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,Many a generation yet unborn
3468,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"Will bless the name of Valley Forge, and hold"
3469,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,In reverence the field of Gettysburg.
3470,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,But war is not the only thing that tries
3471,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,The bravest soul. To live does sometimes take
3472,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,More courage than to close with death; and oft
3473,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,The coward shrinks from living when the brave
3474,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,Man scorns to die. We need no bugle note
3475,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,To rouse our manhood's strength. The call to men
3476,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,Is clear and strong. It is not to repel
3477,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"The Hun, the Teuton, or the Slav, nor yet"
3478,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,To drive the Yellow Peril from the seas.
3479,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"We must send forth our men to live, not die--"
3480,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"We need to save, not kill our fellow man,"
3481,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"To smite the Minotaur of Sin, and stop"
3482,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,The tribute greater now than all the tolls
3483,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,Of war. The beast in man is ravenous
3484,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,And must be slain. He feeds upon the fruits
3485,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"Of toil, and blights the home with poverty;"
3486,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,He drags the innocent to dens of shame
3487,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,To satisfy his brute carnality.
3488,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,No fiery dragon in the days of myth
3489,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,Laid waste a land or blasted life with breath
3490,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,More foul or appetite insatiate.
3491,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,This is the enemy that we must fight.
3492,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"No dreadnaughts now afloat, no submarines,"
3493,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,No legions that may ever bivouac on
3494,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"Our shores, no Zeppelins disgorging fire"
3495,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,Portend the dire disasters wrought upon
3496,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,Our nation's strength by Avarice and Lust.
3497,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"The sword of Theseus is too dull a blade,"
3498,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,The arm of Beowulf not strong enough
3499,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,To battle with Cupidity and Sin.
3500,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"We need the breastplate of a righteous life,"
3501,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"Our loins must be girt about with truth,"
3502,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"The heart protected by the shield of faith,"
3503,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,And in the right hand there must ever be
3504,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,"The spirit's sword, which is the Word of God!"
3505,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,And even clothed and weaponed thus it takes
3506,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,A heart as fearless as the dauntless Dane's
3507,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,To strike the Mammon of Unrighteousness--
3508,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,To grapple with this Grendel that invades
3509,THE VIRILE SPIRIT,The mead-halls still and ravishes our youth.

3610,AN EMBER ETCHING,
3611,AN EMBER ETCHING,An old man sat before his great log fire
3612,AN EMBER ETCHING,And gazed dreamily into the dying blaze.
3613,AN EMBER ETCHING,His eyes were red as though with weeping.
3614,AN EMBER ETCHING,"The long, thin locks of hair"
3615,AN EMBER ETCHING,Were spotless as the snow
3616,AN EMBER ETCHING,Silently mantling the earth
3617,AN EMBER ETCHING,That last sad night of the dying year.
3618,AN EMBER ETCHING,Four days and nights
3619,AN EMBER ETCHING,He had sat beside the bed
3620,AN EMBER ETCHING,Of his life-companion.
3621,AN EMBER ETCHING,But now the watchers by the bier
3622,AN EMBER ETCHING,"In the adjoining room,"
3623,AN EMBER ETCHING,Were dozing in their chairs.
3624,AN EMBER ETCHING,The cold night
3625,AN EMBER ETCHING,"Had driven the mice from their hiding,"
3626,AN EMBER ETCHING,And the loud tick of the clock
3627,AN EMBER ETCHING,No longer frightened them
3628,AN EMBER ETCHING,As they scampered over the hearth.
3629,AN EMBER ETCHING,
3630,AN EMBER ETCHING,"The man was breathing heavily,"
3631,AN EMBER ETCHING,"Although his eyes were open,"
3632,AN EMBER ETCHING,And his stare fixed upon the fire:
3633,AN EMBER ETCHING,_Down by a gnarled oak near the spring
3634,AN EMBER ETCHING,Two children played.
3635,AN EMBER ETCHING,Rebecca had dipped a dock leaf
3636,AN EMBER ETCHING,"In the water,"
3637,AN EMBER ETCHING,And now whisked it in the sunlight.
3638,AN EMBER ETCHING,Against the trunk of the tree
3639,AN EMBER ETCHING,There was a playhouse made of broken boughs.
3640,AN EMBER ETCHING,"The girl's dolls were lying on the green moss bed,"
3641,AN EMBER ETCHING,And a little cracked slate lay upon the ground.
3642,AN EMBER ETCHING,An almost illegible scrawl was written on the slate.
3643,AN EMBER ETCHING,Two childish hands had traced their names:
3644,AN EMBER ETCHING,"""Rupert--Rebecca."""
3645,AN EMBER ETCHING,And the words were linked together by lines
3646,AN EMBER ETCHING,That looked like twisted ropes.
3647,AN EMBER ETCHING,"The boy and girl sat down before the playhouse,"
3648,AN EMBER ETCHING,And crossed their hands in imitation
3649,AN EMBER ETCHING,Of the lines that bound their names together.
3650,AN EMBER ETCHING,And then they smiled
3651,AN EMBER ETCHING,And looked upon the dolls
3652,AN EMBER ETCHING,Asleep in the fresh June morning._
3653,AN EMBER ETCHING,
3654,AN EMBER ETCHING,A chunk broke and fell in the ashes.
3655,AN EMBER ETCHING,The blaze died into a glow of coals.
3656,AN EMBER ETCHING,In the gray beyond the dog irons
3657,AN EMBER ETCHING,The old man saw two figures
3658,AN EMBER ETCHING,Sitting before an awning:
3659,AN EMBER ETCHING,_Two golden haired children
3660,AN EMBER ETCHING,Slept in a little bed.
3661,AN EMBER ETCHING,The man and woman who sat beside the shelter
3662,AN EMBER ETCHING,"Were old and bent,"
3663,AN EMBER ETCHING,Their faces thin and white.
3664,AN EMBER ETCHING,They clasped their hands
3665,AN EMBER ETCHING,And looked into each other's face.
3666,AN EMBER ETCHING,And then they turned and looked
3667,AN EMBER ETCHING,Upon the children.
3668,AN EMBER ETCHING,"A coal dropped into the picture,"
3669,AN EMBER ETCHING,And the fitful fire died
3670,AN EMBER ETCHING,Into deepening shadows._
3671,AN EMBER ETCHING,
3672,AN EMBER ETCHING,Next day the pall-bearers
3673,AN EMBER ETCHING,Bore two bodies away
3674,AN EMBER ETCHING,And lowered a single coffin
3675,AN EMBER ETCHING,Into a grave
3676,AN EMBER ETCHING,Beneath the snow-laden cedar.
3677,AN EMBER ETCHING,
3678,AN EMBER ETCHING,
3679,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND
3680,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,
3681,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"A little maiden blue-jay,"
3682,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Fresh from her April morning bath,"
3683,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Sat on the limb of a weeping willow,"
3684,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Preening her shining feathers
3685,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And dreaming of a song
3686,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,To which she had listened
3687,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,On the afternoon of the preceding day.
3688,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,A wild joy was in her heart
3689,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And yet it took all the sunshine and song
3690,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,From a hundred other throats
3691,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,To withstand the gloom
3692,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,That seemed hovering just above her.
3693,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"She was conscious of the threatening cloud,"
3694,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,But her heart beat furiously
3695,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And hope thrilled her bird-being
3696,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,With an unwonted light.
3697,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"And yet she knew,"
3698,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"When she dared to think at all,"
3699,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,That it was a hopeless hope
3700,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,That flooded her soul with love--
3701,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,A hope that must ere long
3702,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Change to a black despair.
3703,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,She lifted her crested head
3704,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And looked toward the old beech tree
3705,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Where her blue-jay lover now sat
3706,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,In melancholy gloom.
3707,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Why not raise her voice
3708,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And gladden his heart?
3709,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,He had been true and faithful
3710,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"For many weeks,"
3711,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And his suit would long since
3712,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Have won another's love.
3713,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Why had she thrilled
3714,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,At the alien voice of another throat?
3715,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,She had been a foolish maiden
3716,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,To have entertained so wild a thought.
3717,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,
3718,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,But hark! Again the song!
3719,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,On the topmost spire
3720,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Of yonder Gothic poplar
3721,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Sits a cardinal fop,"
3722,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"In a coat of matchless red,"
3723,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And a beak of shining ivory.
3724,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,He lifts his sumach plume
3725,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Into the glinting sunlight
3726,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And sends a Cupid shaft
3727,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,From his beaded eye
3728,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Into the trembling breast
3729,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Of little maiden blue-jay.
3730,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Poor little mademoiselle!
3731,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Once more the notes
3732,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Come whistling and glittering
3733,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Like a shower of pearls
3734,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Through the sunshine:
3735,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"""Oh! my true love is a little blue-jay--"
3736,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Mademoiselle, my bird gazelle,"
3737,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"My little gazelle, and I love her well."
3738,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Fresh and sweet from her morning spray
3739,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,She sits on the willow and her crest is gay--
3740,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Mademoiselle, my little gazelle I love so well."""
3741,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,
3742,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Down from his commanding height
3743,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Flashed the cardinal flame
3744,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And perched on another limb
3745,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Of the weeping willow.
3746,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And then he strutted and pranced
3747,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And capered and danced
3748,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And shot his fiery glances
3749,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Toward the modest little maiden
3750,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Whose heart was now fluttering
3751,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Beyond all control. Master blue-jay
3752,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Over on the beech bough
3753,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Saw the terrible tragedy
3754,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,That would follow in the wake of betrayal
3755,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And was desperate to save this Psyche
3756,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,To whom he had often poured out his soul
3757,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"In amorous vows,"
3758,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Swearing by all the gods in birdland
3759,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,That there was none other beside her.
3760,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,But like many another lover
3761,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Of larger experience and better advantage,"
3762,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,He forgot that the very way
3763,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,To lose his loved one
3764,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Was to berate his rival,"
3765,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And lifting his reed
3766,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"To the upper register of a clarinet,"
3767,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,He almost screamed:
3768,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,
3769,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"""He's a liar, he is, by the god of all birds,"
3770,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,A master of villainous art--
3771,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"A hypocrite, a varlet, believe not his words,"
3772,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"This dandy, this fop, deceiver, betrayer,"
3773,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"A coward, seducer, a murderous slayer--"
3774,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"He'll crush thy innocent heart."""
3775,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,
3776,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Poor little maiden blue-jay
3777,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Heard his screams of anger and despair
3778,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,But heeded not the warning.
3779,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,She only fluttered over
3780,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,To where the cardinal sat
3781,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"And threw herself under his protecting arm,"
3782,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Declaring her perfect faith
3783,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,In his undying love.
3784,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,
3785,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,The red prince lifted
3786,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,His burning plume triumphantly
3787,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Into the sunlight,"
3788,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And shot a contemptuous glance
3789,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Toward the old beech tree.
3790,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Master Blue-Jay unable
3791,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Longer to control himself,"
3792,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Darted like a lance of blue steel
3793,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,At the red coat.
3794,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"But the high churchman was a skilled fencer,"
3795,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And stepped aside just in time
3796,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,To send his antagonist
3797,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,With terrible momentum
3798,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Into the thorn tree
3799,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Beyond the willow,"
3800,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Where a moment later he writhed and fluttered,"
3801,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Pinioned through his body
3802,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,By a sword-like thorn
3803,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,That projected from the trunk of the spiny tree.
3804,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,It was a sight to touch the heart
3805,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Of the most abandoned denizen of birdland.
3806,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"But Mademoiselle Blue-Jay,"
3807,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Who would ordinarily have wept
3808,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"At so sad a fate of one of her kind,"
3809,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Was just now too happy
3810,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,In the love of her wooer
3811,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,To notice another;
3812,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And unmindful of the ebbing life-blood
3813,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,That was fast turning her unfortunate lover's coat
3814,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Of bright and shining blue
3815,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"To one of dark and dull maroon,"
3816,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,She nestled close
3817,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,To the false-hearted ecclesiastic
3818,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And sighed the lovelorn sigh
3819,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,That has come from the maiden heart
3820,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Since the foundation of the world.
3821,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,
3822,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,The low cedar
3823,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,In which Madam Blue-Jay-Cardinal now sat
3824,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,On such a nest of eggs
3825,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"As no blue-jay had ever brooded over before,"
3826,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Wondering, fearing, doubting, longing--"
3827,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Was only a rod or so from the spiny thorn
3828,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Where the dried body of the fated lover
3829,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Still hung.
3830,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,But where now was the supercilious fop
3831,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Whose seductive vows of love
3832,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Had won the little maiden's confidence
3833,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And robbed her true and faithful lover
3834,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Of that incense that belonged of right
3835,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Only to him?
3836,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,For more than a week
3837,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,She had not seen him.
3838,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Surely he would return on the morrow,"
3839,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,For he must remember
3840,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,That soon the little brood
3841,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Would need his protecting love.
3842,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Yes, he would return again"
3843,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,To praise her slender form and shining crest
3844,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And call her once more his little gazelle.
3845,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,
3846,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,But the cardinal came not.
3847,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"The brood had hatched,"
3848,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And the little birds were covered now
3849,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,With tiny feathers.
3850,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Strange sight!
3851,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,All the blue-jays in the woods around
3852,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Had gathered to witness
3853,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,What no mortal bird had ever seen before--
3854,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Little birdling blue-jays
3855,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,With crimson stains on wings and breasts!
3856,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"And the poor little mother,"
3857,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Madam Blue-Jay-Cardinal,"
3858,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"No longer mademoiselle, the bird gazelle,"
3859,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,But an outcast and disgraced mother
3860,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Of a mongrel offspring,"
3861,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Left alone in this hour of shame,"
3862,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Remembered now the words of him
3863,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Who had warned against this sad hour.
3864,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,
3865,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"But the memory brought her only bitter grief,"
3866,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"And she watched her brood in broken-hearted sorrow,"
3867,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,As they looked with wondering eyes
3868,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,At the strange panorama in birdland.
3869,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And all the blue-jays sat in silent condemnation
3870,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Of the unpardonable sin.
3871,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,There was no mercy
3872,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,To be found in all the land of birds
3873,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,For either the forsaken mother
3874,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Or her little brood.
3875,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,The deserted wife and widowed mother blue-jay
3876,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Suddenly threw her wings
3877,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Over the astonished little children,"
3878,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,As though to wipe the stain of sin
3879,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"From their innocent lives,"
3880,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"And as she did so,"
3881,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,The crested cardinal
3882,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"With a fresh crimson bride flashed by,"
3883,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And perched upon the old beech limb.
3884,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And there he sat
3885,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"In undisturbed and cynical silence,"
3886,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,While all the court
3887,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Of high crimes and misdemeanors
3888,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Praised his sacerdotal coat and shining mitre.
3889,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"The mother felt the birdlings stir beneath her wing,"
3890,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And their scarlet stain suffuse her being.
3891,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,She looked toward the thorn tree
3892,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,But no word was spoken.
3893,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,A wise old owl that moped and moaned
3894,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,On the limb of a sycamore tree
3895,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,That overhung the little stream
3896,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Suddenly lifted his voice and cried:
3897,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,
3898,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"""Let him who is without stain of sin,"
3899,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Lift the first note of song
3900,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Against the little blue-jay."""
3901,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,
3902,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,But all the woods were still.
3903,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Only the thorn tree swayed slightly in the breeze,"
3904,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And then a flute-like note floated out
3905,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Upon the wondering air:
3906,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"""Oh! my little blue-jay, my little bluebell,"
3907,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,I would I could come to thee;
3908,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"I would find all the food for thy sin-stained brood,"
3909,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And thy bridegroom I should be.
3910,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,That villainous fop on the old beech limb
3911,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And the arrogant wife that sits by him
3912,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Have broken the heart of my little bluebell,"
3913,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"The little gazelle, the bird gazelle he loved so well,"
3914,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And they laugh in their cynical glee.
3915,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Oh! I would heal thy deep chagrin,"
3916,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Forgive thy blood-stained life its sin,"
3917,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"And thou shouldst be my beauteous bride,"
3918,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Forever happy at my side.
3919,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"My hope, my joy, my love, my pride,"
3920,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"If I could only come to thee,"
3921,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"If I could only come to thee."""
3922,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,
3923,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Again the air was silent as the tomb.
3924,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,The little mother bird
3925,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Moved with her frightened children
3926,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Toward the old thorn tree.
3927,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And when she at last stood
3928,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Beneath the sword
3929,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Upon which her faithful lover was pinioned
3930,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Behold the miracle that was enacted
3931,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Before her wondering eyes.
3932,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,The crimson dyes
3933,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,That streaked the birdlings' wings and breasts
3934,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,"Turned suddenly to a dull and dark maroon,"
3935,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,And not a jay in all birdland
3936,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,But would swear that her little children
3937,A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND,Now resembled in every line and stain
