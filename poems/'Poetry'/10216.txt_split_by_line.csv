100,PREFACE.,
101,PREFACE.,
102,PREFACE.,All through my busy years of prose writing I have occasionally
103,PREFACE.,"jotted down idle thoughts in rhyme.  Imagining ideal scenes,"
104,PREFACE.,"ideal characters, and then, as is the way, I suppose, with more"
105,PREFACE.,"ambitious poets, trying to put myself inside the personalities"
106,PREFACE.,"I have invoked, trying to feel as they would be likely to, speak"
107,PREFACE.,the words I fancied they would say.
108,PREFACE.,
109,PREFACE.,"The many faults of my verses I can see only too well; their merits,"
110,PREFACE.,"if they have any, I leave with the public--which has always been"
111,PREFACE.,so kind to me--to discover.
112,PREFACE.,
113,PREFACE.,"And half-hopefully, half-fearfully, I send out the little craft"
114,PREFACE.,on the wide sea strewn with so many wrecks.  But thinking it must
115,PREFACE.,"be safer from adverse winds because it carries so low a sail, and"
116,PREFACE.,will cruise along so close to the shore and not try to sail out
117,PREFACE.,in the deep waters.
118,PREFACE.,
119,PREFACE.,"And so I bid the dear little wanderer (dear to me), God-speed, and"
120,PREFACE.,bon voyage.

131,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?
132,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,
133,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,
134,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,It is not the lark's clear tone
135,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,"Cleaving the morning air with a soaring cry,"
136,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,Nor the nightingale's dulcet melody all the balmy night--
137,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,Not these alone
138,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,Make the sweet sounds of summer;
139,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,"But the drone of beetle and bee, the murmurous hum of the fly"
140,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,And the chirp of the cricket hidden out of sight--
141,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,These help to make the summer.
142,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,
143,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,"Not roses redly blown,"
144,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,"Nor golden lilies, lighting the dusky meads,"
145,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,"Nor proud imperial pansies, nor queen-cups quaint and rare--"
146,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,Not these alone
147,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,Make the sweet sights of summer
148,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,"But the countless forest leaves, the myriad wayside weeds"
149,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,"And slender grasses, springing up everywhere--"
150,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,These help to make the summer.
151,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,
152,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,One heaven bends above;
153,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,The lowliest head ofttimes has sweetest rest;
154,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,"O'er song-bird in the pine, and bee in the ivy low,"
155,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,"Is the same love, it is all God's summer;"
156,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,"Well pleased is He if we patiently do our best,"
157,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,"So hum little bee, and low green grasses grow,"
158,WHAT MAKES THE SUMMER?,You help to make the summer.

162,THE BROTHERS.,THE BROTHERS.
163,THE BROTHERS.,
164,THE BROTHERS.,
165,THE BROTHERS.,"High on a rocky cliff did once a gray old castle stand,"
166,THE BROTHERS.,From whence rough-bearded chieftains led their vassals--ruled
167,THE BROTHERS.,the land.
168,THE BROTHERS.,"For centuries had dwelt here sire and son, till it befell,"
169,THE BROTHERS.,"Last of their ancient line, two brothers here alone did dwell."
170,THE BROTHERS.,
171,THE BROTHERS.,"The eldest was stern-visaged, but the youngest smooth and fair"
172,THE BROTHERS.,"Of countenance; both zealous, men who bent the knee in prayer"
173,THE BROTHERS.,"To God alone; loved much, read much His holy word,"
174,THE BROTHERS.,"And prayed above all gifts desired, that they might see"
175,THE BROTHERS.,their Lord.
176,THE BROTHERS.,
177,THE BROTHERS.,"For this the elder brother carved a silent cell of stone,"
178,THE BROTHERS.,"And in its deep and dreary depths he entered, dwelt alone,"
179,THE BROTHERS.,"And strove with scourgings, vigils, fasts, to purify his gaze,"
180,THE BROTHERS.,And sought amidst these shadows to behold the Master's face.
181,THE BROTHERS.,
182,THE BROTHERS.,And from the love of God that smiles on us from bright
183,THE BROTHERS.,"lipped flowers,"
184,THE BROTHERS.,"And from the smile of God that falls in sunlight's golden showers,"
185,THE BROTHERS.,"That thrills earth's slumbering heart so, where its warm rays fall"
186,THE BROTHERS.,"That it laughs out in beauty, turned he as from tempters all."
187,THE BROTHERS.,
188,THE BROTHERS.,From bird-song running morn's sweet-scented chalice o'er
189,THE BROTHERS.,"with cheer,"
190,THE BROTHERS.,"The child's light laughter, lifting lowliest souls heaven near,"
191,THE BROTHERS.,"From tears and glad smiles, linked light and gloom of"
192,THE BROTHERS.,"the golden day,"
193,THE BROTHERS.,"He counting these temptations all, austerely turned away."
194,THE BROTHERS.,
195,THE BROTHERS.,"And thus he lived alone, unblest, and died unblest, alone,"
196,THE BROTHERS.,"Save for a brother monk, who held the carved cross of stone"
197,THE BROTHERS.,"In his cold, rigid clasp, the while his dying eyes did wear"
198,THE BROTHERS.,"A look of mortal striving, mortal agony, and prayer."
199,THE BROTHERS.,
200,THE BROTHERS.,"Though at the very last, as his stiff fingers dropped the cross,"
201,THE BROTHERS.,"A gleam as from some distant city swept his face across,"
202,THE BROTHERS.,"The clay lips settled into calm--thus did the monk attest,"
203,THE BROTHERS.,A look of one who through much peril enters into rest.
204,THE BROTHERS.,
205,THE BROTHERS.,"Not thus did he, the younger brother, seek the Master's face;"
206,THE BROTHERS.,"But in earth's lowly places did he strive his steps to trace,"
207,THE BROTHERS.,"Wherever want and grief besought with clamorous complaint,"
208,THE BROTHERS.,"There he beheld his Lord--naked, athirst, and faint."
209,THE BROTHERS.,
210,THE BROTHERS.,"And when his hand was wet with tears, wrung with a grateful grasp,"
211,THE BROTHERS.,He lightly felt upon his palm the Elder Brother's clasp;
212,THE BROTHERS.,"And when above the loathsome couch of woe and want bent he,"
213,THE BROTHERS.,"A low voice thrilled his soul, ""So have ye done it unto Me."""
214,THE BROTHERS.,
215,THE BROTHERS.,"Despised he not the mystic ties of blood, yet did he claim"
216,THE BROTHERS.,"The broader, wider brotherhood, with  every race and name;"
217,THE BROTHERS.,"To his own kin he kind and loyal was in truth, yet still,"
218,THE BROTHERS.,His mother and his brethren were all who did God's will
219,THE BROTHERS.,
220,THE BROTHERS.,"All little ones were dear to him, for light from Paradise"
221,THE BROTHERS.,Seemed falling on him through their pure and innocent eyes;
222,THE BROTHERS.,"The very flowers that fringed cool streams, and gemmed"
223,THE BROTHERS.,"the dewy sod,"
224,THE BROTHERS.,To his rapt vision seemed like the visible smiles of God.
225,THE BROTHERS.,
226,THE BROTHERS.,The deep's full heart that throbs unceasing against the silent
227,THE BROTHERS.,"ships,"
228,THE BROTHERS.,"The waves together murmuring with weird, mysterious lips"
229,THE BROTHERS.,"To hear their untranslated psalm, drew down his anointed ear,"
230,THE BROTHERS.,"And listening, lo! he heard God's voice, to Him was he so near."
231,THE BROTHERS.,
232,THE BROTHERS.,"The happy hum of bees to him made summer silence sweet,"
233,THE BROTHERS.,"Not lightly did he view the very grass beneath his feet,"
234,THE BROTHERS.,"It paved His presence-chamber, where he walked a happy guest,"
235,THE BROTHERS.,"Ah! slight the veil between, in very truth his life was blest."
236,THE BROTHERS.,
237,THE BROTHERS.,"And when on a still twilight passed he to the summer land,"
238,THE BROTHERS.,"Those whom he had befriended, weeping, clinging to his hand,"
239,THE BROTHERS.,"The west gleamed with a sudden glory, and from out the glow"
240,THE BROTHERS.,"Trembled the semblance of a crown, and rested on his brow."
241,THE BROTHERS.,
242,THE BROTHERS.,"And with wide, eager eyes he smiled, and stretched his hands"
243,THE BROTHERS.,"abroad,"
244,THE BROTHERS.,As if his dearest friend were welcoming him to his abode;
245,THE BROTHERS.,Eternal silence sealed that wondrous smile as he cried--
246,THE BROTHERS.,"""Thy face! Thy face, dear Lord!"" and, saying this, he died."
247,THE BROTHERS.,
248,THE BROTHERS.,"But legends tell that on his grave fell such a strange, pure"
249,THE BROTHERS.,"light,"
250,THE BROTHERS.,"That wine-red roses planted thereupon would spring up white,"
251,THE BROTHERS.,"Holding such mystic healing in their cool snow bloom, that lain"
252,THE BROTHERS.,"On aching brows or sorrowful hearts, they would ease their pain."
253,THE BROTHERS.,

256,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.
257,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,
258,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,
259,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"The years go by, but they little seem"
260,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Like those within our dream;
261,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"The years that stood in such luring guise,"
262,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Beckoning us into Paradise,"
263,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,To jailers turn as time goes by
264,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Guarding that fair land, By-and-By,"
265,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Where we thought to blissfully rest,"
266,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,The sound of whose forests' balmy leaves
267,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Swaying to dream winds strangely sweet,"
268,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"We heard in our bed 'neath the cottage eaves,"
269,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Whose towers we saw in the western skies
270,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"When with eager eyes and tremulous lip,"
271,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"We watched the silent, silver ship"
272,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Of the crescent moon, sailing out and away"
273,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"O'er the land we would reach some day, some day."
274,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,
275,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"But years have flown, and our weary feet"
276,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Have never reached that Isle of the Blest;
277,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"But care we have felt, and an aching breast,"
278,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"A lifelong struggle, grief, unrest,"
279,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,That had no part in our boyish plans;
280,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"And yet I have gold, and houses, and lands,"
281,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"And ladened vessels a white-winged fleet,"
282,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,That fly at my bidding across the sea;
283,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,And hats are doffed by willing hands
284,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,As I tread the village street;
285,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,But wealth and fame are not to me
286,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,What I thought that they would be.
287,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,
288,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,I turn from it all to wander back
289,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,With Memory down the dusty track
290,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Of the years that lie between,"
291,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"To the farm-house old and brown,"
292,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Shaded with poplars dusky green,"
293,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"I pause at its gate, not a bearded man,"
294,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,But a boy with earnest eyes.
295,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,
296,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,I stand at the gate and look around
297,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"At the fresh, fair world that before me lies."
298,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,The misty mountain-top aglow
299,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"With love of the sun, and the pleasant ground"
300,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Asleep at its feet, with sunny dreams"
301,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Of milk-white flowers in its heart, and clear"
302,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,The tall church-spire in the distance gleams
303,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Pointing up to the tranquil sky's
304,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Blue roof that seems so near.
305,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,
306,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,And up from the woods the morning breeze
307,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Comes freighted with all the rich perfume
308,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"That from myriad spicy cups distils,"
309,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Loitering along o'er the locust-trees.
310,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Scattering down the plum-trees' bloom
311,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,In flakes of crimson snow--
312,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Down on the gold of the daffodils
313,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,That border the path below.
314,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,
315,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,And the silver thread of the rivulet
316,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Tangled and knotted with fern and sedge.
317,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,And the mill-pond like a diamond set
318,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,In the streamlet's emerald edge;
319,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"And over the stream on the gradual hill,"
320,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Its headstones glimmering palely white,"
321,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Is the graveyard quiet and still.
322,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"I wade through its grasses rank and deep,"
323,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Past slanting marbles mossy and dim,"
324,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Carven with lines from some old hymn,"
325,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,To one where my mother used to lean
326,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,On Sunday noons and weep.
327,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,That tall white shape I looked upon
328,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"With a mysterious dread,"
329,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Linking unto the senseless stone
330,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,The image of the dead--
331,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,The father I never had seen;
332,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"I remember on dark nights of storm,"
333,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"When our parlor was bright and warm,"
334,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"I would turn away from its glowing light,"
335,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"And look far out in the churchyard dim,"
336,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,And with infinite pity think of him
337,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Shut out alone in the dismal night.
338,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,
339,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"And the ruined mill by the waterfall,"
340,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"I see again its crumbling wall,"
341,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,And I hear the water's song.
342,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,It all comes back to me--
343,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Its song comes back to me,"
344,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Floating out like a spirit's call
345,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,The drowsy air along;
346,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Blending forever with my name
347,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Wonderful prophecies, dreamy talk,"
348,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Of future paths when I should walk
349,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Crowned with manhood, and honor, and fame."
350,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,
351,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,I shut my eyes and the rich perfume
352,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Of the tropical lily fills the room
353,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,From its censer of frosted snow;
354,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,But it seems to float to me through the night
355,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,From those apple-blossoms red and white
356,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,That starred the orchard's fragrant gloom;
357,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Those old boughs hanging low,"
358,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Where my sister's swing swayed to and fro
359,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Through the scented aisles of the air;
360,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,While her merry voice and her laugh rung out
361,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Like a bird's, to answer my brother's shout,"
362,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"As he shook the boughs o'er her curly head,"
363,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Till the blossoms fell in a rosy rain
364,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,On her neck and her shining hair.
365,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Oh, little Belle!"
366,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Oh, little sister, I loved so well;"
367,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,It seems to me almost as if she died
368,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"In that lost time so gay and fair,"
369,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,And was buried in childhood's sunny plain;
370,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"And she who walks the street to-day,"
371,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Or in gilded carriage sweeps through the town
372,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Staring her humbler sisters down,"
373,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"With her jewels gleaming like lucent flame,"
374,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Proud of her grandeur and fine array,"
375,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Is only a stranger, who bears her name."
376,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,
377,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"And the little boy who played with me,"
378,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Hunting birds'-nests in sheltered nooks,"
379,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Trudging at nightfall after the cows,"
380,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Exploring the barn-loft, fording the brooks,"
381,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Ending, in school-time, puzzled brows"
382,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Over the same small lesson books;
383,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Who knelt by my side in the twilight dim,"
384,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Praying ""the Lord our souls to keep,"""
385,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Then on the same pillow fell asleep,"
386,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Hushed by our mother's evening hymn;
387,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Whose heart and mine kept such perfect time,"
388,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Such loving cadence, such tender rhyme,"
389,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Blent in child grief, and perfected in glee--"
390,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"We meet on the street and we clasp the hand,"
391,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,And our names on charitable papers stand
392,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Side by side, and we go and bow"
393,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Our two gray heads with prayer and vow,"
394,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"In the same grand church, and hasty word"
395,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Of anger, has never our bosoms stirred."
396,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Yet a whole wide world is between us now;
397,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,How broad and deep does the gulf appear
398,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Between the hearts that were so near!
399,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,
400,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"I have pleasure grounds and mansions grand,"
401,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"Low-voiced servants come at my call,"
402,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,From Senate my name sounds over the land
403,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"In ""ayes"" and ""nays"" so solemnly read;"
404,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"They call me ""Honorable,"" ""General,"" and all,"
405,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"But to-night I am only Charley again,"
406,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"I am Charley, and want to lay my head"
407,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"On my mother's heart and rest,"
408,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,With her soft hand pressed upon my brow
409,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Curing its weary pain.
410,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,"But never, nevermore will it be,"
411,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,For mould and marble rises now
412,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Between my head and that loving breast;
413,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,And death has a cruel power to part--
414,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,Forever gone and lost to me
415,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,That true and tender heart.
416,A RICH MAN'S REVERIE.,

1437,THE LADY MAUD.,For the dull earth caught a beauty
1438,THE LADY MAUD.,It never had before;
1439,THE LADY MAUD.,"But you left a lonesome shadow,"
1440,THE LADY MAUD.,That will lie there evermore.

1600,THE STORY OF GLADYS.,"Of Heaven, not to be vexed with earthly love,"
1601,THE STORY OF GLADYS.,"But yet, upon the last night of his stay,"
1602,THE STORY OF GLADYS.,"As by the lake's low marge he met the maid,"

1606,THE STORY OF GLADYS.,"And said but this, ""Say, is dear love a dream?"""
1607,THE STORY OF GLADYS.,
1608,THE STORY OF GLADYS.,"""Nay, not a dream,"" she murmured, looking out"

1665,THE STORY OF GLADYS.,"Despairing, wailing, through the lonely room,"
1666,THE STORY OF GLADYS.,"The silent turret chamber steep and high,"
1667,THE STORY OF GLADYS.,"""Thou maiden mother, Mary, knows my heart,"

2455,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"I am an outcast, sinful and vile I know,"
2456,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"But what are you, my lady, so fair, and proud, and high?"
2457,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"The fringe of your robe just touched me, me so low--"
2458,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Your feet defiled, I saw the scorn in your eye,"
2459,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"And the jeweled hand, that drew back your garments fine."
2460,THE WAGES OF SIN.,What should you say if I told you to your face
2461,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Your robes are dyed with as deep a stain as mine,"
2462,THE WAGES OF SIN.,The only difference is you are better paid for disgrace.
2463,THE WAGES OF SIN.,
2464,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"You loved a man, you promised to be his bride,"
2465,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Strong vows you gave, you were in the sight of Heaven his wife,"
2466,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"And when you sold yourself for another's wealth, he died;"
2467,THE WAGES OF SIN.,And what is that but murder?  To take a life
2468,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"That is a little beyond my guilt, I ween,"
2469,THE WAGES OF SIN.,To murder the one you love is a crime of deeper grade
2470,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Than mine, yet in purple you walk on the earth a queen;"
2471,THE WAGES OF SIN.,I think the wages of sin are very unequally paid.
2472,THE WAGES OF SIN.,
2473,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"For what did you receive when you sold yourself for his gold,"
2474,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"When with guilty loathing you plighted your white, false hand,"
2475,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"A palace in town and country, his name long centuries old,"
2476,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"A carriage with coachmen and footmen, wealth in broad tracts"
2477,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"of land,"
2478,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Wealth in coffers and vaults, high station, the family gems,"
2479,THE WAGES OF SIN.,For these you stood at God's altar and swore to a lie;
2480,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"But smother your conscience to silence if it condemns,"
2481,THE WAGES OF SIN.,With this you are liberally paid for your life of infamy.
2482,THE WAGES OF SIN.,
2483,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"What wages did I receive when I gave myself for his love,"
2484,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"So young, so weak, and loving him, loving him so--"
2485,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"What did I get for my sin, O merciful God above!"
2486,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"But the terrible, terrible wages--pain and want and woe;"
2487,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"The world's scorn, and my own contempt and disdain,"
2488,THE WAGES OF SIN.,The hideous hue of guilt that stares in every eye.
2489,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Like you I cannot 'broider with gold my garments' stain,"
2490,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"You see, my lady, you get far better wages than I."
2491,THE WAGES OF SIN.,
2492,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"In your constancy to sin you far exceed my power,"
2493,THE WAGES OF SIN.,Since that day marked with blackness from other days--
2494,THE WAGES OF SIN.,The day before your marriage--never since that hour
2495,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Have I heard his voice, have I looked upon his face;"
2496,THE WAGES OF SIN.,For I threw his gold at his feet and stole away
2497,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Anywhere--anywhere--only out of his sight,"
2498,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Longing to hide from the mocking glare of the day,"
2499,THE WAGES OF SIN.,Longing to cover my eyes forever away from the light.
2500,THE WAGES OF SIN.,
2501,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"And long I strove to hate him, for I thought"
2502,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"I was so young, a friendless orphan left to his care,"
2503,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"It was a terrible sin that he had wrought,"
2504,THE WAGES OF SIN.,And since I had the burden of guilt to bear
2505,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"It was enough without the wild despair of love,"
2506,THE WAGES OF SIN.,So I strove to reason my passionate love to hate.
2507,THE WAGES OF SIN.,Can we kneel with tears and bid the strong sun move
2508,THE WAGES OF SIN.,Away from the sky?  It is vain to war with fate.
2509,THE WAGES OF SIN.,
2510,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"That a hard life I have lived since then, 'tis true,"
2511,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"My hands are unblackened by sinful wages since that day,"
2512,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"And my baby died, I was not fit, God knew"
2513,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"To guide a sinless soul, so He took my bird away;"
2514,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"And my heart was empty and lone as a robin's winter nest,"
2515,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"With the trusting eyes that never looked scornfully,"
2516,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"The head that nestled fearlessly on my guilty breast,"
2517,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"And the little constant hands that clung to me, even me."
2518,THE WAGES OF SIN.,
2519,THE WAGES OF SIN.,But I knew it were best for God to unclasp her hand
2520,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"From mine, while yet she clung to it in trust,"
2521,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Than for her to draw it from me, live to understand,"
2522,THE WAGES OF SIN.,Blush for her mother--had she lived she must.
2523,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"And then she had her father's smile, and his soft, dark eyes,"
2524,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Maybe she would have had his fair, false ways--his heart."
2525,THE WAGES OF SIN.,It is well that she passed through the starry gate of the skies
2526,THE WAGES OF SIN.,Though it closed and bars us forever and ever apart.
2527,THE WAGES OF SIN.,
2528,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"For I am a sinful woman, well I know,"
2529,THE WAGES OF SIN.,And though by others' sins my own are not excused
2530,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Things seem so strange to me in this strange world of woe,"
2531,THE WAGES OF SIN.,In a maze of doubt and wonder I get confused;
2532,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Whether a sin of impulse, born of a fatal love,"
2533,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Is worse than deliberate bargain, a life of legal shame,"
2534,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Legal below, I think in the courts above"
2535,THE WAGES OF SIN.,The heavenly scribes will call a crime by its right name.
2536,THE WAGES OF SIN.,
2537,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"But we stand before the wise, wise judgment-seat"
2538,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Of the world, and it calls you pure,"
2539,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"That in your pearl-gemmed breast all saintly virtues meet,"
2540,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Holier than other holy women, higher, truer,"
2541,THE WAGES OF SIN.,So sweet a creature an angel in woman's guise.
2542,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"They would not wonder much, though much they might admire,"
2543,THE WAGES OF SIN.,Should you be caught again up to your native skies
2544,THE WAGES OF SIN.,From an alien world in a chariot of fire.
2545,THE WAGES OF SIN.,
2546,THE WAGES OF SIN.,So we stand before the tender judgment-seat
2547,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Of the world, and it calls me vile,"
2548,THE WAGES OF SIN.,So low that it is a wonder God will let
2549,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"His joyous sunshine gild my guilty head with its smiles,"
2550,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"An outcast barred beyond the pale of hope,"
2551,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Beyond the lamp of their mercy's flickering light,"
2552,THE WAGES OF SIN.,They would scarcely wonder if the earth should ope
2553,THE WAGES OF SIN.,And swallow up the wretch from their vexed sight.
2554,THE WAGES OF SIN.,
2555,THE WAGES OF SIN.,Before another judgment-seat one day we will stand
2556,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"You and I, my lady, and he by our side,"
2557,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"He who won my heart, who held my life in his hand,"
2558,THE WAGES OF SIN.,He who bought you with gold to be his bride;
2559,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"Before an assembled world we shall stand, we three,"
2560,THE WAGES OF SIN.,"To meet from the merciful Judge our doom of weal or woe,"

3226,ROSES OF JUNE.,"And her eyes are looking beyond the earth, far, far away."
3227,ROSES OF JUNE.,
3228,ROSES OF JUNE.,"She was born in this cottage home, the sweetest rosebud of spring,"
3229,ROSES OF JUNE.,"And grew with its flowers, the fairest blossom of all,"
3230,ROSES OF JUNE.,Till her friends ambitiously said she would grace
3231,ROSES OF JUNE.,"the kingliest hall,"

3233,ROSES OF JUNE.,
3234,ROSES OF JUNE.,"A man of riches and taste saw the maiden's face,"
3235,ROSES OF JUNE.,"And thought her beauty would grace his stately southern home,"

3240,ROSES OF JUNE.,"He decked her in costly attire, and showed her beauty with pride"

3245,ROSES OF JUNE.,"He had polished the beautiful unknown gem and set it in gold,"

3255,ROSES OF JUNE.,And dark-browed slaves awaited her queenly will.
3256,ROSES OF JUNE.,
3257,ROSES OF JUNE.,"Why should she dream of the past, of the days of old,"

3274,ROSES OF JUNE.,"So it was not sin, she said, as she breathed it low"
3275,ROSES OF JUNE.,In the midnight hour when all but she were asleep.
3276,ROSES OF JUNE.,
3277,ROSES OF JUNE.,"But she wearier grew of pride and pomp, like a home sick child"

3283,ROSES OF JUNE.,And she looked down the orchard path and the meadow's clover bloom;
3284,ROSES OF JUNE.,She stood by the stone-walled well that had mirrored her face
3285,ROSES OF JUNE.,"when a child,"
3286,ROSES OF JUNE.,"She saw where the robins built, and her roses clambered wild,"
3287,ROSES OF JUNE.,And lingered lost in thought in each low and rustic room.

3294,ROSES OF JUNE.,
3295,ROSES OF JUNE.,"But at night, when silence and sleep on the lonely hamlet fell"
