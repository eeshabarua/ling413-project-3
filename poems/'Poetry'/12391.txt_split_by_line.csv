94,THE POET'S SECRET.,"The poet's secret I must know,"

98,THE POET'S SECRET.,
99,THE POET'S SECRET.,"I scan the lily and the rose,"
100,THE POET'S SECRET.,"I nod to every nodding tree,"

103,THE POET'S SECRET.,
104,THE POET'S SECRET.,"I question melancholy eyes,"

108,THE POET'S SECRET.,
109,THE POET'S SECRET.,"In vain I watch the day and night,"

112,THE POET'S SECRET.,Which fills the poet's happy soul.
113,THE POET'S SECRET.,
114,THE POET'S SECRET.,Through life I hear the rhythmic flow
115,THE POET'S SECRET.,Whose meaning into song must turn;

128,NOVEMBER.,For autumn charms my melancholy mind.
129,NOVEMBER.,
130,NOVEMBER.,"When autumn comes, the poets sing a dirge:"
131,NOVEMBER.,The year must perish; all the flowers are dead;

134,NOVEMBER.,
135,NOVEMBER.,"Still, autumn ushers in the Christmas cheer,"
136,NOVEMBER.,The holly-berries and the ivy-tree:

138,NOVEMBER.,These waiting mourners do not sing for me!
139,NOVEMBER.,
140,NOVEMBER.,I find sweet peace in depths of autumn woods.
141,NOVEMBER.,Where grow the ragged ferns and roughened moss;

165,MUSIC IN A CROWD.,
166,MUSIC IN A CROWD.,"They were a Vision, though. And are these real,"

170,MUSIC IN A CROWD.,
171,MUSIC IN A CROWD.,Have they my longings for that other world

173,MUSIC IN A CROWD.,Is like the sea; they may be thither hurled
174,MUSIC IN A CROWD.,By storms that thunder and compel;
175,MUSIC IN A CROWD.,
176,MUSIC IN A CROWD.,"Or, like those voyagers in the land of streams,"
177,MUSIC IN A CROWD.,"Glide through its languid air, its languid wave,"
178,MUSIC IN A CROWD.,"To learn that _Here_ and _There_ are but two dreams,"
179,MUSIC IN A CROWD.,That end in Nothing and the Grave!

1387,THE RACE.,
1388,THE RACE.,The guests were gathered in the ancient park
1389,THE RACE.,"Of my Lord Wynne, and he was now their mark"
1390,THE RACE.,"For wit and gossip--quite the usual way,"
1391,THE RACE.,"Where one bestows, and no one need repay."
1392,THE RACE.,"""A stumbling-block his pride; his heart's in strife"
1393,THE RACE.,"Between two women, which to choose for wife."
1394,THE RACE.,"He's always hovering round that lovely girl,"
1395,THE RACE.,"His lawyer's daughter, who will never furl"
1396,THE RACE.,_Her_ flag of pride: she rivals Gilbert there.
1397,THE RACE.,Now watch their meeting; none more bravely wear
1398,THE RACE.,"Their beauty, recognize a woman's own,"
1399,THE RACE.,Than Clara Mercome. Gilbert Wynne has sown
1400,THE RACE.,"His wild oats for her sake; yet he delays,"
1401,THE RACE.,And with my Lady Bond divides his days.
1402,THE RACE.,"Who bets on beauty, hedges in on age;"
1403,THE RACE.,Which tries the flight to perch in Lord Wynne's cage?
1404,THE RACE.,Will Lady Bond or Clara be the queen?
1405,THE RACE.,"For Lady Bond is certain of her lien."""
1406,THE RACE.,He heard this talk while standing by a beech--
1407,THE RACE.,Hugh Wynne--and planned how he might overreach
1408,THE RACE.,"Gilbert and Clara, break the pride of both,"
1409,THE RACE.,"Part them for good, or make them plight their troth."
1410,THE RACE.,"""Now for a race,"" he cried, ""to Martin's Mill;"
1411,THE RACE.,"The boats are here; behold, the lake is still."
1412,THE RACE.,"Here, Gilbert, take your oar; I'll follow soon,"
1413,THE RACE.,Though sunset's nigh--to-night is harvest-moon.
1414,THE RACE.,"Let go the rope, the knot's inside; take these,"
1415,THE RACE.,"Arrange a seat, adjust it at your ease."
1416,THE RACE.,"_She's here_. Miss Mercome, you will help him win"
1417,THE RACE.,"The race, and will not count my wager sin."""
1418,THE RACE.,And he was gone; the pair were face to face.
1419,THE RACE.,"""I'll take the oars,"" he gasped; ""we'll win this race."""
1420,THE RACE.,He never felt his heart so in his breast.
1421,THE RACE.,"""I hope you will forgive my cousin's jest?"""
1422,THE RACE.,A haughty murmur was her sole reply.
1423,THE RACE.,No rowers followed. Never did swallows fly
1424,THE RACE.,"So swift, or dip the lake like Gilbert's oars."
1425,THE RACE.,"He was watchful, careless she. ""There soars"
1426,THE RACE.,"A heron, quite a feature of your state:"

1430,THE RACE.,"""Not being human, wood and water meet"
1431,THE RACE.,"In their own speech, and soulless things are sweet"
1432,THE RACE.,Together. So they are to me. I like
1433,THE RACE.,To watch the herons by the sedgy dike;
1434,THE RACE.,They keep me tranquil; and I love to feed
1435,THE RACE.,The pike in yon old pool; they help to lead--
1436,THE RACE.,"Why, here is Martin's Bridge, and yet no boats!"
1437,THE RACE.,"Shall we return?"" Said Clara then, ""There floats"
1438,THE RACE.,A lily bed beyond; let's shoot beneath
1439,THE RACE.,"The bridge, and lilies pull; I want a wreath."""
1440,THE RACE.,He knew the channel narrow; it was dark;
1441,THE RACE.,But his heart leaped at this relenting mark.
1442,THE RACE.,"He drew his oars up, pointed in the helm,"
1443,THE RACE.,And shot in the cool gloom. He thought no realm
1444,THE RACE.,On which the sun had shone was half so bright.
1445,THE RACE.,And somehow Clara thought it nice as light.
1446,THE RACE.,The waters swirled so swift that in the noise
1447,THE RACE.,"Clara grew dizzy; Gilbert lost his poise,"
1448,THE RACE.,And lost an oar; with a confusing shock
1449,THE RACE.,The boat was grinding--stopped against a rock.
1450,THE RACE.,"""Gilbert, my dear, are we not going down?"""
1451,THE RACE.,"""Dearest, my love, we were not born to drown."
1452,THE RACE.,"Oh, kiss me; we are safe; and grant me now"
1453,THE RACE.,Yourself. I'll gather lilies for your brow;
1454,THE RACE.,"And Hugh will know that I have won the race,"
1455,THE RACE.,"And Clara, my dear wife, her rightful place."""

2455,ON THE HILLTOP.,"The autumn winds tear down my screen,"
2456,ON THE HILLTOP.,And leave me not a leaf to glean.
2457,ON THE HILLTOP.,"The snow will cover glen and height,"
2458,ON THE HILLTOP.,And all my hilltop glisten white;
2459,ON THE HILLTOP.,I see the crystal atoms fly
2460,ON THE HILLTOP.,Under the dome of this gray sky.
2461,ON THE HILLTOP.,"Like gnomes are they, these spectral gleams?"
2462,ON THE HILLTOP.,Or shall I guess them only dreams?
2463,ON THE HILLTOP.,"Whatever is the truth, I say,"
2464,ON THE HILLTOP.,"If up and down the world I stray,"

2472,THE MESSAGE.,
2473,THE MESSAGE.,
2474,THE MESSAGE.,"To you, my comrades, whether far or near,"
2475,THE MESSAGE.,I send this message. Let our past revive;
2476,THE MESSAGE.,"Come, sound reveille to our hearts once more."
2477,THE MESSAGE.,"Expecting, I shall wait till at my door"
2478,THE MESSAGE.,"I see you enter, each and every one"
2479,THE MESSAGE.,"Tumultuous, eager all, with clamorous speech,"
2480,THE MESSAGE.,To hide my stammering welcome and my tears.
2481,THE MESSAGE.,"I am no host carousing long and late,"
2482,THE MESSAGE.,Enticing guests with epicurean hints;
2483,THE MESSAGE.,"Nor am I Timon, sick of this sad world,"
2484,THE MESSAGE.,"Who, jesting, cries, ""The sky is overhead,"
2485,THE MESSAGE.,"And underneath that famous rest, the earth:"
2486,THE MESSAGE.,"Show me the man who can have more at last."""
2487,THE MESSAGE.,
2488,THE MESSAGE.,"Without, the thunder of the city rolls;"
2489,THE MESSAGE.,"Within, the quiet of the student reigns."
2490,THE MESSAGE.,There is a change. Time was a childish voice.
2491,THE MESSAGE.,"Sweet as the lark's when from her nest she soars,"
2492,THE MESSAGE.,"Thrilled over all, and vanished into heaven."
2493,THE MESSAGE.,Music once triumphed here: the skilful hand
2494,THE MESSAGE.,"Of him who rarely struck the keys, and woke"
2495,THE MESSAGE.,"My soul in harmony grand as his own,"
2496,THE MESSAGE.,"Is folded on his breast, my soldier love."
2497,THE MESSAGE.,"Here hangs his portrait, under it his sword;"
2498,THE MESSAGE.,"He served his country, and his grave's afar."
2499,THE MESSAGE.,"Dread not this place as one to relics given,"
2500,THE MESSAGE.,"Though I have decked with amaranth my wall,"
2501,THE MESSAGE.,The testimony of a later loss--
2502,THE MESSAGE.,"His who long wandering in foreign lands,"
2503,THE MESSAGE.,"Then dying, crossed the sea to die with me."
2504,THE MESSAGE.,Behold the sunrise and the morning clouds
2505,THE MESSAGE.,"On yonder canvas, misty mountain-peaks--"
2506,THE MESSAGE.,The simple grandeur of a perfect art!
2507,THE MESSAGE.,"Behold these vivid woods, that gleam beside"
2508,THE MESSAGE.,"The happy vision of an autumn eve,"
2509,THE MESSAGE.,"When red leaves fall, and redder sunsets fade!"
2510,THE MESSAGE.,"The world grows pensive sinking into night,"
2511,THE MESSAGE.,Whose melancholy space hides sighing winds:
2512,THE MESSAGE.,Can they reply to sadder human speech?
2513,THE MESSAGE.,What centuries are counted here--my books!
2514,THE MESSAGE.,"Shadows of mighty men; the chorus, hark!"
2515,THE MESSAGE.,"The antique chant vibrates, and Fate compels!"
2516,THE MESSAGE.,
2517,THE MESSAGE.,"Comrades, return; the midnight lamp shall gleam"
2518,THE MESSAGE.,As in old nights; the chaplets woven then--
2519,THE MESSAGE.,"Withered, perhaps, by time--may grace us yet;"
2520,THE MESSAGE.,"The laurel faded is the laurel still,"
2521,THE MESSAGE.,And some of us are heroes to ourselves.
2522,THE MESSAGE.,And amber wine shall flow; the blue smoke wreathe
2523,THE MESSAGE.,"In droll disputes, with metaphysics mixed;"
2524,THE MESSAGE.,"Or float as lightly as the quick-spun verse,"
2525,THE MESSAGE.,"Threading the circle round from thought to thought,"
2526,THE MESSAGE.,Sparkling and fresh as is the airy web
2527,THE MESSAGE.,Spread on the hedge at morn in silver dew.
2528,THE MESSAGE.,The scent of roses you remember well;
2529,THE MESSAGE.,In the green vases they shall bloom again.
2530,THE MESSAGE.,And me--do you remember? I remain
2531,THE MESSAGE.,"Unchanged, I think; though one I saw like me"
2532,THE MESSAGE.,"Some years ago, with hair that was not white;"
2533,THE MESSAGE.,"And she was with you then, as brave a soul"
2534,THE MESSAGE.,As souls can be whom Fate has not approached.
2535,THE MESSAGE.,"But seek and find me now, unchanged or changed,"

2546,EXILE.,"Whose is the love I had, and have not now?"
2547,EXILE.,"If it be Nature's, let her answer me."
2548,EXILE.,"It wanders by the blue, monotonous sea,"
2549,EXILE.,"Where rushes grow, or follows all the sweep"
2550,EXILE.,Of shallow summer brooks and umber pools.
2551,EXILE.,Or does it linger in those hidden paths
2552,EXILE.,"Where starlike blossoms blow among dead leaves,"
2553,EXILE.,"And dark groves murmur over darker shrubs,"
2554,EXILE.,"Birds with their fledgelings sleep, and pale moths flit?"
2555,EXILE.,"With sunset's crimson flags perhaps it goes,"

2558,EXILE.,"Comes it with sunrise, when the sunrise floats"
2559,EXILE.,"From Night's bold towers, vast in the East, and gray"

2561,EXILE.,"Moving along the verge, stately and slow,"
2562,EXILE.,Ordered by the old music of the spheres?
2563,EXILE.,Perchance it trembles in October's oaks;
2564,EXILE.,"Or, twining with the brilliant, berried vine,"
2565,EXILE.,"Would hide the tender, melancholy elm."
2566,EXILE.,Well might it rest within those solemn woods
2567,EXILE.,Where sunlight never falls--whose tops are green
2568,EXILE.,"With airs from heaven,--its balmy mists and rains,--"
2569,EXILE.,"While underneath black, mossy, mammoth rocks"
2570,EXILE.,Keep silence with the waste of blighted boughs.
2571,EXILE.,"If winter riots with the wreathing snow,"
2572,EXILE.,"And ocean, tossing all his threatening plumes,"
2573,EXILE.,"And winds, that tear the hollow, murky sky,"
2574,EXILE.,"Can this, my love, which dwells no more with me,"
2575,EXILE.,"Find dwelling there,--like some storm-driven bird,"
2576,EXILE.,"That knows not whence it flew, nor where to fly,"
2577,EXILE.,"Between the world of sea and world of cloud,"
2578,EXILE.,At last drops dead in the remorseless deep?

2585,A SEASIDE IDYL.,
2586,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"I wandered to the shore, nor knew I then"
2587,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"What my desire,--whether for wild lament,"
2588,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Or sweet regret, to fill the idle pause"
2589,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Of twilight, melancholy in my house,"
2590,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"And watch the flowing tide, the passing sails,"
2591,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Or to implore the air, and sea, and sky,"
2592,A SEASIDE IDYL.,For that eternal passion in their power
2593,A SEASIDE IDYL.,Which souls like mine who ponder on their fate
2594,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"May feel, and be as they--gods to themselves."
2595,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Thither I went, whatever was my mood."
2596,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"The sands, the rocks, and beds of bending sedge,"
2597,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"I saw alone. Between the east and west,"
2598,A SEASIDE IDYL.,Along the beach no creature moved besides.
2599,A SEASIDE IDYL.,High on the eastern point a lighthouse shone;
2600,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Steered by its lamp a ship stood out to sea,"
2601,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"And vanished from its rays towards the deep,"
2602,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"While in the west, above a wooded isle,"
2603,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"An island-cloud hung in the emerald sky,"
2604,A SEASIDE IDYL.,Hiding pale Venus in its sombre shade.
2605,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"I wandered up and down the sands, I loitered"
2606,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Among the rocks, and trampled through the sedge:"
2607,A SEASIDE IDYL.,But I grew weary of the stocks and stones.
2608,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"""I will go hence,"" I thought; ""the Elements"
2609,A SEASIDE IDYL.,Have lost their charm; my soul is dead to-night.
2610,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Oh passive, creeping Sea, and stagnant Air,"
2611,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Farewell! Dull sands, and rocks, and sedge, farewell."""
2612,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Homeward I turned my face, but stayed my feet."
2613,A SEASIDE IDYL.,Should I go back but to revive again
2614,A SEASIDE IDYL.,The ancient pain? Hark! suddenly there came
2615,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"From over sea, a sound like that of speech;"
2616,A SEASIDE IDYL.,And suddenly I felt my pulses leap
2617,A SEASIDE IDYL.,As though some Presence were approaching me.
2618,A SEASIDE IDYL.,Loud as the voice of Ocean's dark-haired king
2619,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"A breeze came down the sea,--the sea rose high;"
2620,A SEASIDE IDYL.,The surging waves sang round me--this their song:
2621,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"""Oh, yet your love will triumph! He shall come"
2622,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"In love's wild tumult; he shall come once more,--"
2623,A SEASIDE IDYL.,By tracks of ocean or by paths of earth;
2624,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"The wanderer will reach you and remain."""
2625,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"The breakers dashed among the rocks, and they"
2626,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Seemed full of life; the foam dissolved the sands,"
2627,A SEASIDE IDYL.,And the sedge trembled in the swelling tide.
2628,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Was this a promise of the vaunting Sea,"
2629,A SEASIDE IDYL.,Or the illusion of a last despair?
2630,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Either, or both, still homeward I must go,"
2631,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"And that way turned mine eyes, and thought they met"
2632,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"A picture,--surely so,--or I was mad."
2633,A SEASIDE IDYL.,The crimson harvest-moon was rising full
2634,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Above my roof, and glimmered on my walls."
2635,A SEASIDE IDYL.,Within the doorway stood a man I knew--
2636,A SEASIDE IDYL.,No picture this. I saw approaching me
2637,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Him I had hoped for, grieved for, and despaired."
2638,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"""My ship is wrecked,"" he cried, ""and I return"
2639,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Never to leave my love. You are my love?"""
2640,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"""I too am wrecked,"" I sighed, ""by lonely years;"
2641,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Returning, you but find another wreck."""
2642,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"He bent his face to search my own, and spake:"
2643,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"""What I have traversed sea and land to find,"
2644,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"I find. For liberty I fought, and life,"
2645,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"On savage shores and wastes of unknown seas,"
2646,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"While waiting for this hour. Oh, think you not"
2647,A SEASIDE IDYL.,Immortal love mates with immortal love
2648,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Always? And now, at last, we know this love."""
2649,A SEASIDE IDYL.,My soul was filling with a mighty joy
2650,A SEASIDE IDYL.,I could not show--yet must I show my love.
2651,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"""From you whose will divided broke our hearts"
2652,A SEASIDE IDYL.,I now demand a different kiss than that
2653,A SEASIDE IDYL.,Which then you said should be our parting kiss.
2654,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Given, I vow the past shall be forgot."
2655,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"The kiss--and we are one! Give me the kiss."""
2656,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Like the dark rocks upon the sands he stood,"
2657,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"When on his breast I fell, and kissed his lips."
2658,A SEASIDE IDYL.,All the wild clangor of the sea was hushed;
2659,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"The rapid silver waves ran each to each,"
2660,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Lapsed in the deep with joyous, murmured sighs."
2661,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Years of repentance mine, forgiveness his,"
2662,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"To tell. Happy, we paced the tranquil shores,"
2663,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"Till between sea and sky we saw the sun,"
2664,A SEASIDE IDYL.,"And all our wiser, loving days began."

2685,THE CHIMNEY-SWALLOW'S IDYL.,"My life, and pensive vigil holds with me."
2686,THE CHIMNEY-SWALLOW'S IDYL.,No longer does she mourn; she lives serene;
2687,THE CHIMNEY-SWALLOW'S IDYL.,"I see her mother's beauty in her face,"

2694,THE CHIMNEY-SWALLOW'S IDYL.,"The rude alarm of death, its wild amaze"
2695,THE CHIMNEY-SWALLOW'S IDYL.,Is over now. The chance of change has passed;
2696,THE CHIMNEY-SWALLOW'S IDYL.,"No doubtful hopes are mine, no restless dread,"
2697,THE CHIMNEY-SWALLOW'S IDYL.,"No last word to be spoken, kiss to give"
2698,THE CHIMNEY-SWALLOW'S IDYL.,And take in passion's agony and end.
