25,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Thomas Runciman was born in Northumberland in 1841, and died in London"
26,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,in 1909. He was the second son of Walter Runciman of Dunbar and Jean
27,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Finlay, his wife. In his youth he left the beautiful coast where his"
28,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,father was stationed to go to school and work in Newcastle. Artists of
29,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"his name had been men of mark in Scotland, and as he had their strong"
30,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,feeling for colour he was allowed for a time to become a pupil of
31,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"William Bell Scott, who was on the fringe of the Pre-Raphaelite"
32,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"Movement. Throughout his life he painted portraits and landscapes, but"
33,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"the latter were what he loved. His work was not widely known, for he had"
34,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"a nervous contempt for Exhibitions, and the first collection of his"
35,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,landscapes in water-colour and oil was opened to the public at a
36,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,posthumous exhibition in Newcastle in 1911. He travelled from time to
37,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"time, and enjoyed living on the banks of the Seine, and in other"
38,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,beautiful regions abroad.
39,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,
40,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"His poems were never offered for publication, although critical essays"
41,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"of his appeared from time to time, as for instance in the ""London"" of"
42,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,Henley and Stevenson. The Songs and Sonnets were written for his own
43,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"satisfaction, and were sent to a few faithful friends and to members of"
44,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"his own family, who have allowed me to collect and print them. The"
45,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"miscellaneous verses were in many instances found in letters, and others"
46,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,written in high spirits were rescued after his death from sketch books
47,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"and scraps of paper by his daughter, Kate Runciman Sellers, and by his"
48,INTRODUCTORY NOTE,"friend, Edward Nisbet."

62,I.,
63,I.,"Though here fair blooms the rose and the woodbine waves on high,"
64,I.,"And oak and elm and bracken frond enrich the rolling lea,"
65,I.,"And winds as if from Arcady breathe joy as they go by,"
66,I.,Yet I yearn and I pine for my North Countrie.
67,I.,
68,I.,"I leave the drowsing south and in dreams I northward fly,"
69,I.,And walk the stretching moors that fringe the ever-calling sea;
70,I.,"And am gladdened as the gales that are so bitter-sweet go by,"
71,I.,While grey clouds sweetly darken o'er my North Countrie.
72,I.,
73,I.,"For there's music in the storms, and there's colour in the shades,"
74,I.,And there's joy e'en in the sorrow widely brooding o'er the sea;
75,I.,And larger thoughts have birth among the moors and lowly glades
76,I.,And reedy mounds and sands of my North Countrie.

87,II.,Hearts that were earth-wearied;
88,II.,
89,II.,You who know--if aught be known
90,II.,In that everlasting Hush
91,II.,"Where the life-born years are strewn,"
92,II.,"Where the eyeless ages rush,--"
93,II.,
94,II.,"Tell me, is it conscious rest"
95,II.,Heals the whilom hurt of life?
96,II.,Or is Nirvana undistressed
97,II.,E'en by memory of strife?

107,III.,
108,III.,When Grief comes this way by
109,III.,"With her wan lip and drooping eye,"
110,III.,"Bid her welcome, woo her boldly;"
111,III.,Soon she'll look on thee less coldly.
112,III.,
113,III.,Her tears soon cease to flow.
114,III.,'Tis now not Grief but Joy we know;
115,III.,From her smiling face the roses
116,III.,Tell the glad metempsychosis.

126,IV.,Life with the fun in it--
127,IV.,Shadowed by Doom!
128,IV.,
129,IV.,Life with its Love ever haunted by Hate!
130,IV.,Life's laughing morrows frowned over by Fate!
131,IV.,Young Life's wild gladness still waylaid by Age!
132,IV.,All its sweet badness still mocking the sage!
133,IV.,What can e'er measure the joy of its strife?
134,IV.,
135,IV.,What boundless leisure
136,IV.,Count the heaped treasure
137,IV.,"Of woe, that's the pleasure"

150,V.,"Young were her sister souls, Sorrow and Mirth."
151,V.,
152,V.,Dark mirrors are her eyes:
153,V.,Wherein who gaze
154,V.,See wan effulgencies
155,V.,Flicker and blaze--
156,V.,Lorn fleeting shadows of beautiful days.
157,V.,
158,V.,Scan those deep mirrors well
159,V.,After long years:
160,V.,Lo! what aforetime fell
161,V.,"In rain of tears,"
162,V.,In radiant glamour-mist now reappears.
163,V.,
164,V.,See old wild gladness
165,V.,Tamed now and coy;
166,V.,Grief that was madness
167,V.,Turned into joy.
168,V.,"Fate cannot harry them now, nor annoy."
169,V.,
170,V.,"Down from yon throbbing blue,"
171,V.,"Passionless, fair,"
172,V.,"Still faces look on you,"
173,V.,"Sunlit their hair,"
174,V.,With a slow smile at your pleasure and care.
175,V.,
176,V.,Life and death murmurings
177,V.,From their lips go
178,V.,In vaster music-rings;

192,VI.,The first--before our marriage was.
193,VI.,
194,VI.,"And though the fields of corn and grass,"
195,VI.,"So radiant then, as summers pass"
196,VI.,"Lose something of their look of bliss,"
197,VI.,My love's unchanged.
198,VI.,
199,VI.,Our tiny girl's a sturdy lass;
200,VI.,Our boy's shrill pipe descends to bass;
201,VI.,"New friends appear, the old we miss;"

213,VII.,
214,VII.,A gurly breeze swept from the pool
215,VII.,"The Autumn peace so blue and cool,"
216,VII.,Which all day long had dreamed thereon
217,VII.,"Of men and things aforetime gone,"
218,VII.,"Their vanished joy, their ended dule:"
219,VII.,"So glooms the sea, so sounds her brool,"
220,VII.,As from the East at eve comes on
221,VII.,A gurly breeze.
222,VII.,
223,VII.,Sense yields to Fancy 'neath whose rule
224,VII.,This inland scene is quickly full

241,I.,
242,I.,
243,I.,Low mourned the Oread round the Arcadian hills;
244,I.,The Naiad murmured and the Dryad moaned;
245,I.,The meadow-maiden left her daffodils
246,I.,To join the Hamadryades who groaned
247,I.,Over a sister newly fallen dead.
248,I.,That Life might perish out of Arcady
249,I.,From immemorial times was never said;
250,I.,Yet here one lay dead by her dead oak-tree.
251,I.,"""Who made our Hamadryad cold and mute?"""
252,I.,The others cried in sorrow and in wonder.

271,II.,"Of life, even in blameless Arcady."
272,II.,"Bay, laurel, myrtle, ivy never sere,"
273,II.,"And fields flower-decorated all the year,"
274,II.,"And streams that carry secrets to the sea,"

291,III.,Whose later stage was quick with mirthful shows
292,III.,"And clasping loves, with hate and hearty blows,"
293,III.,And dreams of coming gifts withheld by Fate
294,III.,"From morrow unto morrow, till her great"
295,III.,"Dread eyes 'gan tell of other gifts than those,"
296,III.,And her advancing wings gloomed like a pall;
297,III.,Her speech foretelling joy became a dirge
298,III.,As piteous as pitiless; and all

317,IV.,--So cries the sportsman brisk at break of day.
318,IV.,"""The sound of hound and horn is well for thee,"""

334,V.,"From the white rest, the ante-natal bliss,"
335,V.,"Not loth, the wondrous wondering soul awakes;"
336,V.,"Now drawn to that illusion, now to this,"
337,V.,With gathering strength each devious pathway takes;
338,V.,Till at the noon of life his aims decline;
339,V.,"Evermore earthward bend the tiring eyes,"

353,VI.,Summer is fragrant should he this way pass;
354,VI.,His calm love is a chain that binds me fast....
355,VI.,Yet often melancholy will forecast
356,VI.,That time when I shall have grown old--when he--
357,VI.,Still rapturous in his struggle with life's blast--
358,VI.,"Shall give a pitying side glance to me,"
359,VI.,"Who skirt the fog-fringe of eternity,"
360,VI.,Straining mine eyes to catch what shadowy sign
361,VI.,"Of good or evil omen there may be,"

379,VII.,From nature and man's passions still are made.
380,VII.,The music of their motion as they pranced
381,VII.,Lulled me to flawless ease as of a God;
382,VII.,Never upon me pain or pleasure chanced;
