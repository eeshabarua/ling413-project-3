56,INTRODUCTION,
57,INTRODUCTION,
58,INTRODUCTION,The verses in this volume cover very many and various occasions; and are
59,INTRODUCTION,therefore the very contrary of what is commonly called occasional verse.
60,INTRODUCTION,The term is used with a meaning that is very mutable; or with a meaning
61,INTRODUCTION,that has been greatly distorted and degraded. Occasion should mean
62,INTRODUCTION,opportunity; and in the case of poetry it should rather mean
63,INTRODUCTION,provocation. And the trick of writing upon what are called public
64,INTRODUCTION,"occasions, instead of upon what may truly be described as private"
65,INTRODUCTION,"provocations, has been responsible for much verse which is not only"
66,INTRODUCTION,insufficient but insincere. It has produced not only many bad poems; but
67,INTRODUCTION,"what is perhaps worse, many bad poems from many good poets. The"
68,INTRODUCTION,sincerity of Miss Sibyl Bristowe's poetry is perhaps most clearly proved
69,INTRODUCTION,"by the number of points at which it touches life; and the spontaneity,"
70,INTRODUCTION,"or even suddenness, with which they are touched. It is an occasional"
71,INTRODUCTION,"verse which arises out of real occasions, and not out of merely"
72,INTRODUCTION,fictitious or even merely formal ones. Thus while the one or two poems
73,INTRODUCTION,"on the great war are probably the best, they are by no means the"
74,INTRODUCTION,biggest; they are not the most arresting in the sense of being the most
75,INTRODUCTION,"ambitious. They are arresting because the great war really is great, and"
76,INTRODUCTION,moves an imaginative spirit to great issues; it is public but it is very
77,INTRODUCTION,"far from being official. The war, indeed, is necessarily more important"
78,INTRODUCTION,as a private event even than as a public event. And the few but fine
79,INTRODUCTION,"lines, on a brother fallen in a fight amid wild river that sundered man"
80,INTRODUCTION,"from man, is a model of the manner in which such mighty events take"
81,INTRODUCTION,their place among the impressions of the more sincere and spontaneous
82,INTRODUCTION,type of talent. The topic takes its pre-eminence by intensity and not by
83,INTRODUCTION,"space, or even in a sense by design. Indeed it is best expressed in a"
84,INTRODUCTION,metaphor used by the writer herself about the topic itself; the metaphor
85,INTRODUCTION,"of the colour red in its relation to other colours. Red rivets the eye,"
86,INTRODUCTION,not by quantity but by quality; and in any picture or pattern a spot or
87,INTRODUCTION,streak of it will make itself the feature or the key. Miss Sibyl
88,INTRODUCTION,Bristowe's poem conceives the Creator confronted as with a broken
89,INTRODUCTION,spectrum or a gap in coloured glass; feeling the whole range of vision
90,INTRODUCTION,"to be dim and impoverished and adding, by the authority of His own"
91,INTRODUCTION,"mysterious art, the dreadful colour of martyrdom."
92,INTRODUCTION,
93,INTRODUCTION,Indeed the point of the comparison might very well be conveyed by the
94,INTRODUCTION,two poems about a London garden; that on the garden in peace being
95,INTRODUCTION,"comparatively long, and that about the garden in war exceedingly short;"
96,INTRODUCTION,short but sharply pathetic with its notion of peering and probing for
97,INTRODUCTION,the microscope flowers that must be a part of the most utilitarian
98,INTRODUCTION,vegetables. Indeed the short poems are certainly the most successful;
99,INTRODUCTION,and there is the same brevity in the last line of the poem about the
100,INTRODUCTION,"tragic passage of time; ""If lips of children had not told me so."" The"
101,INTRODUCTION,"same general impression, as in the comparison already noted, is"
102,INTRODUCTION,"conveyed, for instance, in the fact that the poems about South Africa"
103,INTRODUCTION,"are private rather than public poems; are in that sense, if the phrase"
104,INTRODUCTION,"be properly comprehended, rather colonial than imperial. That is, they"
105,INTRODUCTION,"are individual glimpses of great torrid wastes, like similar individual"
106,INTRODUCTION,glimpses of quiet northern woods; visions of crude and golden cities as
107,INTRODUCTION,personal as the parallel visions of normal northern cottages. Miss Sibyl
108,INTRODUCTION,"Bristowe is perhaps an amateur, in the sense in which this is generally"
109,INTRODUCTION,true of one who happens to be an artist in another art; but it is
110,INTRODUCTION,unfortunate that the world has so much missed the notion of that natural
111,INTRODUCTION,ardour that should belong to the word.

211,PAGE,My Garden is a tiny square
212,PAGE,Of bordered green
213,PAGE,And gravel brown
214,PAGE,"In misty town,"
215,PAGE,And chimneys smoky and unclean
216,PAGE,Sweep to the sky.--_You_ would not care
217,PAGE,To visit there.
218,PAGE,
219,PAGE,The Grass creeps up all in between the stones
220,PAGE,And raises undisturbed its luscious green
221,PAGE,And laughs for youth in shrill and ringing tones.
222,PAGE,"I love it that it grows up so serene,"
223,PAGE,Dauntless and bright
224,PAGE,"And laughing me to scorn,"
225,PAGE,"So vivid and so slight,"
226,PAGE,Glad for the night-shed dew and smoke-bred morn.
227,PAGE,
228,PAGE,My little patch of bordered green and brown
229,PAGE,"Sleeps in the bosom of a grim old town,"
230,PAGE,I wish that you could see
231,PAGE,Its beauty here with me;
232,PAGE,"I'd tell you many things you never knew,"
233,PAGE,"For few, so few"
234,PAGE,"Know the romance of such a London strip,"
235,PAGE,With ferny screen
236,PAGE,That slants shy gleams of sunlight in between
237,PAGE,"And weeds which flourish just inside the dip,"
238,PAGE,Holding their tenure with a firm deep grip
239,PAGE,Where prouder things all die.
240,PAGE,Small wonder I
241,PAGE,"Tend my tall weed as tho' it were a gem,"
242,PAGE,"Note every leaf, and watch the stalwart stem"
243,PAGE,Wax strong and high--
244,PAGE,My weed plot lives in reckless luxury.
245,PAGE,
246,PAGE,"But, in the Spring, before black grime"
247,PAGE,"Has done its worst,"
248,PAGE,And cruel Time
249,PAGE,And dust accursed
250,PAGE,"Have marred the innocence of each young leaf,"
251,PAGE,"Or soiled the blossoms, like a wanton thief--"
252,PAGE,"Masses of tulips, pink and white,"
253,PAGE,"Rise from the earth in prim delight,"
254,PAGE,"And iris, king of pomp and state,"
255,PAGE,In vesture fine
256,PAGE,And purple and pale gold
257,PAGE,Its buds unfold--
258,PAGE,"A mighty potentate,"
259,PAGE,"And marshals nobly, proudly into line,"
260,PAGE,"Whilst lilacs sway in wind and rushing breeze,"
261,PAGE,Bowing and nodding to some poplar trees.
262,PAGE,
263,PAGE,But stay!--
264,PAGE,_You_ would not care
265,PAGE,To visit there
266,PAGE,Midst such surroundings grey.
267,PAGE,My Garden's but an oasis of hope
268,PAGE,Set in the frown
269,PAGE,"And dismal grandeur of a grim old town,"
270,PAGE,A semblance merely of the lawns _you_ see;
271,PAGE,"A hint, an echo of the things that be!"
272,PAGE,But he or she would be a misanthrope
273,PAGE,Who would not share my garden hope with me.

285,PAGE,"Of green-leaved artichokes and turnip tops,"

303,PAGE,Waddled round in your inside
304,PAGE,"Cold as ice-blocks, straddled wide,"

659,PAGE,"In a sheet of earth in the dewy ground,"

1049,PAGE,"I have seen, what no man hath seen"

1054,PAGE,"I have heard, what no man hath heard"

1068,PAGE,
1069,PAGE,"Whiles they leapt in a maddened dance,"

1071,PAGE,Eddied and swirled to a swift advance

1073,PAGE,
1074,PAGE,"Spent and worn, in their frenzied fear,"
1075,PAGE,Leaves of brown-gold
1076,PAGE,"Chittering feebly in masses sere,"

1099,PAGE,"Trimmed them with adjectives and adverbs fair,"
1100,PAGE,"And studying every law of form and rhyme,"
1101,PAGE,Pieced up his metre into studious time.

1105,PAGE,
1106,PAGE,"One dew-drenched eve, whilst pondering in the vale"
1107,PAGE,He felt the leaves a-quiver in the dale--
1108,PAGE,"Stooping, he caught a whisper from the sky"
1109,PAGE,That slipped from out the twilight whimsically.
1110,PAGE,
1111,PAGE,"Its tender sorrow touched him as it fell,"
1112,PAGE,"Quickened his fancies, stirred his heart as well,"
1113,PAGE,"In reverent awe he heard its mystic call,"
1114,PAGE,A heaven-born glory permeating all.
1115,PAGE,
1116,PAGE,He did not dare to pin that whisper down
1117,PAGE,"To words so peacocked in a flaunting gown,"
1118,PAGE,The forms of metre he had conned so well
1119,PAGE,Were all inadequate that sigh to tell.
1120,PAGE,
1121,PAGE,"No further use that artificial code,"

1125,PAGE,
1126,PAGE,"Each little trick, each fantasy of art"
1127,PAGE,Were stones that blocked th' outpourings of his heart.
1128,PAGE,"He looked beyond the great inrushing sea,"
1129,PAGE,Seeing at last the hidden things that be!
1130,PAGE,
1131,PAGE,"And of the wave he learnt a cadence sweet,"
1132,PAGE,"Strong as its life, a lilt of rippling feet,"
1133,PAGE,Whilst from the wind that swept the answering trees
1134,PAGE,He culled the moaning rhythm of the breeze.
1135,PAGE,
1136,PAGE,He weaved that whisper of the twilight sky
1137,PAGE,"Into a poem, soft with melody,"
1138,PAGE,"It thrilled the soul in motion strong and free,"
1139,PAGE,"Wild as the wave, a break of ecstasy."
1140,PAGE,
1141,PAGE,"It kissed the borderland 'twixt heaven and earth,"
1142,PAGE,"Sweet in its passion, holy in its mirth--"

1154,PAGE,
1155,PAGE,
1156,PAGE,So Elizabeth danced
1157,PAGE,And the guest was entranced
1158,PAGE,"As she tripped the Coranto, and curtseyed and swayed"
1159,PAGE,"In a robe of rich stuff,"
1160,PAGE,"Jewelled slashings and ruff,"
1161,PAGE,"And a stomacher stiff, thick with pearlings and braid."
1162,PAGE,"Ho! he peeped round the curtain,"
1163,PAGE,'Tis perfectly certain
1164,PAGE,Enraptured of mien

1168,PAGE,

1173,PAGE,"To have witnessed such grace, such elegant----"" here"
1174,PAGE,"He could find no more words, and emotion 'twas clear"
1175,PAGE,"Choked all further utterance,"
1176,PAGE,For never had such a dance
1177,PAGE,Entered his thought.
1178,PAGE,Such slippers! and ought
1179,PAGE,He to mention the hose?
1180,PAGE,All of silk to suppose?
1181,PAGE,Had the muse from Olympus stepped down for a while
1182,PAGE,Terpsichore style?
1183,PAGE,Then quite without guile
1184,PAGE,"He bowed very low in his Frenchified way,"
1185,PAGE,"In that courtly way, of a far-off day,"
1186,PAGE,And the laugh of the lady was merry and gay.
1187,PAGE,
1188,PAGE,"And all throughout Europe the fame of her spread,"
1189,PAGE,"Her frivolous tricks, and the foreigners said"
1190,PAGE,"It was only a princess, a slave to her pride,"
1191,PAGE,True child of a mother a king had decried!--
1192,PAGE,So she thwarted and twisted the world to her whim
1193,PAGE,As he misunderstood her--she outwitted him!
1194,PAGE,
1195,PAGE,"Now one day it arose that King Philip of Spain,"
1196,PAGE,"Incensed at her folly, essayed yet again"
1197,PAGE,To bring her to reason
1198,PAGE,Just at his own season.
1199,PAGE,"So he sent his Ambassador, Spanish Mendoza,"
1200,PAGE,"To this slippery Queen, with a message sub rosa."
1201,PAGE,
1202,PAGE,"""Nay, by mine honour,"" she simpered. ""How now,"
1203,PAGE,Is it truce to my jest? 'Tis a pity I trow.
1204,PAGE,"It were best to be merry!"" She yawned very wide,"
1205,PAGE,And the Spaniard furtively smiled at her side.
1206,PAGE,"'Twas only a woman to flatter and kiss,"
1207,PAGE,'Twould be easy to manage a creature like this!
1208,PAGE,
1209,PAGE,"Hard-headed and wise, sat the gaunt English Queen,"
1210,PAGE,"Her words were unyielding, her purse it was mean--"
1211,PAGE,The Spanish Ambassador
1212,PAGE,Writhed like a matador!
1213,PAGE,"Beaten and wounded, he played to her vanity."
1214,PAGE,--It was tucked out of sight--and with Spanish profanity
1215,PAGE,"He cursed all the Protestants under his breath,"
1216,PAGE,And committed them gently to burnings and death;
1217,PAGE,"But never an inch did Elizabeth yield,"
1218,PAGE,"And the messenger saw that his mission was sealed,"
1219,PAGE,In that far-off day.
1220,PAGE,And Elizabeth laughed
1221,PAGE,In a curious way
1222,PAGE,That was subtle with craft:
1223,PAGE,"""Under favour, you may"
1224,PAGE,"Tell your master in Spain, that my country comes first."
1225,PAGE,"I am England, and English, its best and its worst."
1226,PAGE,"Tell him my subjects I love as my children,"
1227,PAGE,Tell him they thirst but their mouths will be filled when
1228,PAGE,They meet him at sea.
1229,PAGE,"Give that greeting from me."""
1230,PAGE,
1231,PAGE,"Back to Madrid went that Spanish Ambassador,"
1232,PAGE,"Broken and bruised like a bull-beaten matador,"
1233,PAGE,And he bowed very low
1234,PAGE,(It was etiquette so)
1235,PAGE,"And he cried, ""Oh, that Queen is the devil in sooth."
1236,PAGE,"A fool, Sire, 'twas thought, for she danced so uncouth!"
1237,PAGE,"But her bargains are hard as her heart and her hand,"
1238,PAGE,"As her dreary dominions, her men and her land!"
1239,PAGE,"And never be gulled by her feminine vanity,"
1240,PAGE,"'Tis only a pose, all her vacant inanity!"
1241,PAGE,"Let us man an armada to crush her and raid her,"
1242,PAGE,"To send her to hell to the demons who made her!"""
1243,PAGE,

1255,PAGE,God! How the Spaniards fled in a panic
1256,PAGE,"When our fire-ships had neared them,"
1257,PAGE,"And blazed them, and seared them,"
1258,PAGE,Wrapping their hulks in red flamings Satanic!
1259,PAGE,"God, how they scattered,"
1260,PAGE,"Slipped anchor, and shattered,"
1261,PAGE,"Sails tattered,"
1262,PAGE,"Masts battered,"
1263,PAGE,Up to the north whilst a mighty sou'-wester

1266,PAGE,"On that treacherous bank,"
1267,PAGE,"Lost, lost evermore"
1268,PAGE,On our alien shore.
1269,PAGE,
1270,PAGE,With their grim freight of death
1271,PAGE,And the poisonous breath

1472,PAGE,And the stamping machine with a brutal joy
1473,PAGE,"Wrenches the gold from its quartz alloy,"
1474,PAGE,Crushing the tortured stone to dust
1475,PAGE,As it yields the ore
1476,PAGE,To the vast unquenchable thirst for lust.
1477,PAGE,
1478,PAGE,_Feel_ the south wind!
1479,PAGE,"As it sweeps the veld with its icy breath,"
1480,PAGE,"Biting the scrub with its teeth of death,"
1481,PAGE,lifting the dust like a phantom shroud
1482,PAGE,"From the tailing heaps, in a veil of cloud."
1483,PAGE,"Scattering the belching smoke, which flies"
1484,PAGE,From the chimney line that marks the rise
1485,PAGE,Of the Main Reef ridge.
1486,PAGE,Some devil's bridge
1487,PAGE,To bind the town to the broad full plain
1488,PAGE,"Which rolls beyond, like the boundless main."
1489,PAGE,
1490,PAGE,Precocious town!
1491,PAGE,The forward child of a youthful state
1492,PAGE,"So young in years. So rich, so great"
1493,PAGE,"In gilt renown,"
1494,PAGE,And glittering fate!
1495,PAGE,"Oh! ponder deep, all ye! Yet pity"
1496,PAGE,"This marvellous, golden, old-young city!"
1497,PAGE,
1498,PAGE,
1499,PAGE,
1500,PAGE,
1501,PAGE,In the Land of the Silences
1502,PAGE,
1503,PAGE,
1504,PAGE,"She stood before the tent, a winging tent"
1505,PAGE,"In thicknesses of canvas, taut and strong,"
1506,PAGE,"Burning beneath a sun unreticent,"
1507,PAGE,"Raised upon planks, and lashed with rope and thong."
1508,PAGE,"And she was fair, a sprig of English May,"
1509,PAGE,Born for the kiss of merriment and day.
1510,PAGE,
1511,PAGE,"Wide from the tent, like swell on swell of sea"
1512,PAGE,"The great veld swept and rolled in curves away,"
1513,PAGE,A shabby patch of God's eternity
1514,PAGE,"Neglected by the angels, bare and grey,"
1515,PAGE,Wind-swept and solitary. Dick and she
1516,PAGE,Had made this veld their home for seasons three.
1517,PAGE,
1518,PAGE,"_Well_ she remembered that first reckless ride,"
1519,PAGE,"Their wedding journey over spruit and land,"
1520,PAGE,"The barbed-wire straggling snares, the kopje side,"
1521,PAGE,"The crumbling blockhouse dreaming of command,"
1522,PAGE,"Holding a loot of empty pot and tin,"
1523,PAGE,Which once had held a soldier guard within.
1524,PAGE,
1525,PAGE,"The mud-dogged drift, the dust all baked and red"
1526,PAGE,"Twisting in spiral devils, raw as rust,"
1527,PAGE,"Those lonely crosses leaning on their dead,"
1528,PAGE,Murmuring Africa was never just.
1529,PAGE,"""She knows no pity,"" shrieked the fierce South wind,"
1530,PAGE,"""She steals your youth and stultifies your mind."""
1531,PAGE,
1532,PAGE,"On, on they flew, past Kaffir boom and kraal,"
1533,PAGE,"Thorn wacht-een-beetje, fleshy aloe clump,"
1534,PAGE,"Through the charred stretches of the high Transvaal,"
1535,PAGE,"By meerkat hole, and rounded white-ant hump"
1536,PAGE,"Of tunnelled earth. She laughed; the air was wild,"
1537,PAGE,"Strong with exhilaration, undefiled."
1538,PAGE,
1539,PAGE,At last they reined. Across the scrub and veld
1540,PAGE,Dick pointed with his sjambok to the white
1541,PAGE,"Outspreading tent, then to the wattle belt"
1542,PAGE,That marshalled thinly in the shimmering light.
1543,PAGE,"""There lies our home, dear love, for you and me."""
1544,PAGE,"She looked up gladly, smiled him tenderly."
1545,PAGE,
1546,PAGE,"Summer had followed winter, radiant, rich,"
1547,PAGE,"Reckless with life, extravagant in bloom,"
1548,PAGE,"Mad for the first wild draught of water, which"
1549,PAGE,"Burst from the thunder-clouds, whose massive gloom"
1550,PAGE,"Blackened the skies, then splitting, ripped and tore"
1551,PAGE,"Deep gorges through the tracks, with deafening roar."
1552,PAGE,
1553,PAGE,The storms swept by. A fairyland of green
1554,PAGE,Mantled the waking plains; wide star-like flowers
1555,PAGE,"Sprang to their feet; the streams ran strong and clean,"
1556,PAGE,The soft mimosa sprinkled into showers
1557,PAGE,Of golden balls. The oleander hedge
1558,PAGE,Swayed to the line of gums with leaves on edge.
1559,PAGE,
1560,PAGE,"And it was summer now. Beth crossed the sloot,"
1561,PAGE,"Grown arrogant with rains, which lapped her square"
1562,PAGE,"Of gorgeous garden, swirling to the spruit"
1563,PAGE,"Beyond, in childish hurry. Was he there?"
1564,PAGE,"She scanned the far horizon. No, no sign--"
1565,PAGE,Of man or beast to break the distance line.
1566,PAGE,
1567,PAGE,"Stay, was that he beyond the drift? Ah no,"
1568,PAGE,Only her wishes trembling in the air
1569,PAGE,And mirage heat. A train sedate and slow
1570,PAGE,Wheeled round the kopje far away. The glare
1571,PAGE,Of brazen sun beat in her eyes. Too late!--
1572,PAGE,He would not come to-night! In lonely state
1573,PAGE,
1574,PAGE,"She must endure these o'ercharged dragging hours,"
1575,PAGE,"This th' unspoken horror of her life,"
1576,PAGE,"The dread that sapped her strength, and drained her powers,"
1577,PAGE,The guarded secret of a brave man's wife!
1578,PAGE,Dick would come back to-morrow with the light
1579,PAGE,Of morn. But fear would be her Lord to-night.
1580,PAGE,
1581,PAGE,Beth turned her to the stoep. With sensuous breath
1582,PAGE,"The moonflower drenched the garden in its scent,"
1583,PAGE,"Ardent, voluptuous, and white as death"
1584,PAGE,"It hung long blossoms, heavy with intent."
1585,PAGE,The morning glories folded into sleep.
1586,PAGE,"Lay purple in undress, and slumber deep."
1587,PAGE,
1588,PAGE,"Behind the wattles rose the circled moon,"
1589,PAGE,Splashing her silver over poort and track.
1590,PAGE,"The boys went chattering to their kraals, and soon"
1591,PAGE,Long shadows ribbed the tent in white and black.
1592,PAGE,"Beth closed the entrance fast, then slowly sped,"
1593,PAGE,"A lonely woman, to a lonely bed."

1603,PAGE,"All of white,"
1604,PAGE,"All of white,"
1605,PAGE,Which she flings over all
1606,PAGE,"In the night,"
1607,PAGE,In the night

1616,PAGE,"Threw my blossoms a ray,"
1617,PAGE,"They are white,"
1618,PAGE,"Deadly white,"
1619,PAGE,"And their petals are pale,"
1620,PAGE,Wan and light.
1621,PAGE,"Do not fail,"
1622,PAGE,Come away--in the night.

1630,PAGE,"And my scent,"
1631,PAGE,Oh my scent
1632,PAGE,"Which I waft over all,"
1633,PAGE,Is of death!
1634,PAGE,Feel its breath!
1635,PAGE,And the moon made a pall
1636,PAGE,"Which she lent to us all,"
1637,PAGE,To us all!
1638,PAGE,"Come away.... Come away,"
1639,PAGE,"Come,"
1640,PAGE,"Come,"
1641,PAGE,Come....
1642,PAGE,
1643,PAGE,"""Come, come!""--The sleeper moved. An argent shroud"
1644,PAGE,Woven with silver cross-stitch into stars.
1645,PAGE,Was that the moonflower singing from the cloud?
1646,PAGE,Why were its petals bruised and veined with scars?
1647,PAGE,"""Come!""--It was not the moonflower. Wide awake"
1648,PAGE,Beth started up. That voice!--For pity's sake!
1649,PAGE,
1650,PAGE,"That dear loved voice. The midnight echoed clear,"
1651,PAGE,"Rang with that urgent summons from the veld,"
1652,PAGE,That startling premonition. Far and near
1653,PAGE,Cries shivered through her brain. Dick's voice. She felt
1654,PAGE,"It vibrant in her ears. A call, for her."
1655,PAGE,"She sprang up quickly, every sense astir."
1656,PAGE,
1657,PAGE,"Down past the shadowed garden, through the kloof,"
1658,PAGE,"She knew the way, she followed to the cry."
1659,PAGE,"No stealthy footpad, sound of howl or hoof"
1660,PAGE,Could scare her in the awful mystery
1661,PAGE,"Of God-begotten knowledge. Dick had called,"
1662,PAGE,"Terrestrial things nor checked her, nor appalled."
1663,PAGE,
1664,PAGE,"""This is the shroud,"" she murmured. Over all"
1665,PAGE,"The moon had spread her splendour, cold and white."
1666,PAGE,"""This is the shining drapery, the pall,"
1667,PAGE,"This hoary sheet of clean pellucid light."""
1668,PAGE,Grasping a small revolver in her hand
1669,PAGE,"She hurried on, across the broken land."
1670,PAGE,
1671,PAGE,A mighty Silence wrapped the veld in dreams.
1672,PAGE,The breath of night hung in the soundless air.
1673,PAGE,"A wilderness unknown, unconquered streams"
1674,PAGE,"Lay with the Universe, at one, to dare"
1675,PAGE,"In majesty of nature, undisturbed"
1676,PAGE,"The flux of centuries, untrod, uncurbed."
1677,PAGE,
1678,PAGE,The white world grew before her. Silhouettes
1679,PAGE,Of shadowed kopjes struck against the sky.
1680,PAGE,The vlei gleamed fitfully. With sharp-edged frets
1681,PAGE,The coarse grass cut the horizon lustily.
1682,PAGE,The dancing moonway on the swollen drift
1683,PAGE,Broke into patterns on the current swift.
1684,PAGE,
1685,PAGE,Thwarted. Beth stared in piteous dismay.
1686,PAGE,"A frantic river, wild with recent rains,"
1687,PAGE,"Largened beyond all daring, barred her way."
1688,PAGE,"Flooding the plains, drunk with illicit gains"
1689,PAGE,"It dashed with savage fury, tossing high"
1690,PAGE,Its waters over bank and boundary.
1691,PAGE,
1692,PAGE,The girl looked anxiously around. Below
1693,PAGE,"The river widened, shallowing its bed,"
1694,PAGE,Seeming to flow on leisurely and slow.
1695,PAGE,"Above, it narrowed to a ravine, fed"
1696,PAGE,By the Fountains. Three bald-headed rocks
1697,PAGE,Stood solemnly midstream on thick-set hocks.
1698,PAGE,
1699,PAGE,Straightly she turned towards the upper reach.
1700,PAGE,The portly rocks as old and grey as time
1701,PAGE,Offered a bridge. On past the sunken beach
1702,PAGE,"Of unclean ooze, the sea of gathered slime,"
1703,PAGE,"Across the hunching boulders, where the course"
1704,PAGE,Of huddled waters broke their angry force.
1705,PAGE,
1706,PAGE,"Climbing from rock to rock, from crest to crest,"
1707,PAGE,She threw her weight upon the further bank
1708,PAGE,"Into a clod of mud, whose squelching breast"
1709,PAGE,Received her greedily. She seized the rank
1710,PAGE,"Wild clumps of herbage with her hands, then strove"
1711,PAGE,Until she reached the trusty ridge above.
1712,PAGE,
1713,PAGE,Over the drift! The whisperings of her soul
1714,PAGE,Soothed every hindrance to a thing of naught.
1715,PAGE,"The billowing veld, its tawny ceaseless roll"
1716,PAGE,Was but the highway to the end she sought.
1717,PAGE,"Love was her pilot, and by love controlled"
1718,PAGE,"Its radiance led her, like the Star of old."
1719,PAGE,
1720,PAGE,Far to the east a straggling knot of trees
1721,PAGE,"Hinted a farm was nestling in their rear,"
1722,PAGE,"The scent of flowers floated on the breeze,"
1723,PAGE,"The cattle in their kraals, in safety near"
1724,PAGE,Drowsed in the heavy slumber hours of night.
1725,PAGE,"But to the west she hurried, in her flight."
1726,PAGE,
1727,PAGE,"On, on past trackless scrub, where all around"
1728,PAGE,"Like shapeless monsters bulging heap on heap,"
1729,PAGE,Crouched the vast ant heaps on the virgin ground.
1730,PAGE,"And winding in and out them, pressed and deep,"
1731,PAGE,Two wheel spoors scarred the earth. She traced the curve
1732,PAGE,The cart had chiselled in a sudden swerve.
1733,PAGE,
1734,PAGE,With feverish haste she followed line on line
1735,PAGE,Each deep-hewn rut that carved itself in sand.
1736,PAGE,"Here by the grace of heaven was a sign,"
1737,PAGE,"A way to realise her dream's command,"
1738,PAGE,Her instinct's prophecy. God! what was that?
1739,PAGE,Rending the Silences with tear and scrat.
1740,PAGE,
1741,PAGE,"Again! That shot! Then all the world lay still,"
1742,PAGE,Calm in the deep placidity of strength
1743,PAGE,That recks for nothing human. Passive till
1744,PAGE,Man desecrates its hallowed peace at length.
1745,PAGE,"But to that sound she fled. For Dick lay west,"
1746,PAGE,"His wide eyes staring, blood upon his breast."
1747,PAGE,
1748,PAGE,"Dead, with his face against the cart-wheel. Dead."
1749,PAGE,"A scarlet river flowing, flowing--oh!"
1750,PAGE,"His lips were red, his hands--the plains were red!"
1751,PAGE,"She knelt beside him, spoke him loudly so"
1752,PAGE,"He needs must hear. She bound his wounds in vain,"
1753,PAGE,That nerveless heap would never speak again.
1754,PAGE,
1755,PAGE,"Dawn came at last. No need to wail or cry,"
1756,PAGE,"Dick was beyond all help, and none would hear."
1757,PAGE,"She clasped him in her full-souled agony,"
1758,PAGE,"Feeling the young gold morning, fresh and clear,"
1759,PAGE,"Yet seeing nothing. Stunned to outward things,"
1760,PAGE,She only knew the dullness sorrow brings.
1761,PAGE,
1762,PAGE,And in her numbness heeded not the red
1763,PAGE,Tall grasses swaying as they bowed and bent
1764,PAGE,"Beneath a crawling Kaffir, or his head"
1765,PAGE,"Rear up, a cringing caterpillar sent"
1766,PAGE,To rob the great white Baas; for plenty slow
1767,PAGE,"Some white men take to die, as black men know."
1768,PAGE,
1769,PAGE,"But if the Baas were dead, beyond all doubt"
1770,PAGE,Slink could be brave. His belly clave the ground.
1771,PAGE,"Had anybody heard the white man's shout,"
1772,PAGE,"Caught by the kopjes, echoed in rebound?"
1773,PAGE,"Ach! how he wriggled! Now the cart was Slink's,"
1774,PAGE,"The scoff, the silver watch, the fiery drinks."
1775,PAGE,
1776,PAGE,"And look, the mules outspanned were plenty good,"
1777,PAGE,So was the stolen gun. He reached the pool
1778,PAGE,Of crimson where the two-wheeled Cape-cart stood.
1779,PAGE,"He slithered nearer, wet in dewdrops cool,"
1780,PAGE,"His rough patched trousers soaked, then sneaking round"
1781,PAGE,Peeped from his vantage to the bleeding ground.
1782,PAGE,
1783,PAGE,"Spooks!--His eyes bulged, down dropped his brutal jaw."
1784,PAGE,"Rooted to where he clung, a-sweat with fright,"
1785,PAGE,The cramps of terror gripping at his maw.
1786,PAGE,Spooks!--Pallid spooks! He shrieked away the sight
1787,PAGE,Till the wide veld was reeling. Blurred and pale
1788,PAGE,"A spook arose, to follow on his trail."
1789,PAGE,
1790,PAGE,"It glided nearer, nearer--nearer yet,"
1791,PAGE,Tall as the English mysi far away!
1792,PAGE,"His tongue stuck in his throat, and bleeding wet"
1793,PAGE,He saw the master sitting up at bay!
1794,PAGE,"He heard his name, he heard the still air crack,"
1795,PAGE,"Then dropped astonished, wondering, on his back,"
1796,PAGE,
1797,PAGE,Till every spook had vanished. Slink had gone
1798,PAGE,"To make a longer trek, where plains were dim."
1799,PAGE,"And haggard-eyed and worn, stern vengeance done,"
1800,PAGE,Beth huddled by the poor stiff clay of him
1801,PAGE,"She loved, the smoking weapon in her hand"
1802,PAGE,To scare the scavenger of carrion brand.
1803,PAGE,
1804,PAGE,The hours crawled by. Soaked through with thunder rains
1805,PAGE,"She kept her vigil, loosening her hair"
1806,PAGE,In shining masses o'er him. Wild refrains
1807,PAGE,Of piteous croonings and of vague despair
1808,PAGE,"Crept to her lips, then died away, unsung,"
1809,PAGE,"Hiding their tunes, her shattered dreams among."
1810,PAGE,
1811,PAGE,*       *       *       *       *
1812,PAGE,
1813,PAGE,Jan Rissik trekked him homeward. Half a day
1814,PAGE,To Cellier's farmstead more. The patient team
1815,PAGE,"Of oxen, plodding slowly on their way,"
1816,PAGE,Bent to the nekstrop. Huick! a thin sharp gleam
1817,PAGE,"Of curling whip flicked at the leader, clean,"
1818,PAGE,"Sure as a rapier thrust, and long and lean."
1819,PAGE,
1820,PAGE,The voorlooper strode on ahead. The boys
1821,PAGE,Marched to the rhythm of a sing-song chaunt
1822,PAGE,"To ease their work. The wagon's lumbering noise,"
1823,PAGE,"The cheering of the oxen, stormed the haunt"
1824,PAGE,"Of nature. 'Neath the awning, broad and square"
1825,PAGE,"Sat Rissik's vrouw, worn with maternal care."
1826,PAGE,
1827,PAGE,Her children nestled round her. Two hours yet!
1828,PAGE,The Dutchman whistled as he jogged along
1829,PAGE,In leisured haste. He licked his thick lips wet
1830,PAGE,To loose his tune. A heavy winging throng
1831,PAGE,"Of gorging vultures, black as devil's brood,"
1832,PAGE,"Rose swearing on the air, with protests crude."
1833,PAGE,
1834,PAGE,Some rotting beast! Jan Rissik raised his eyes
1835,PAGE,"To watch the swart aasvogel[B] in their flight,"
1836,PAGE,Cracking his whip to dissipate the flies
1837,PAGE,That swarmed in thousands. Pestilential! Right
1838,PAGE,"Where his oxen wended, straight in front!"
1839,PAGE,"He clambered from his seat with angry grunt,"
1840,PAGE,
1841,PAGE,"And pious prayer politely blended, sure"
1842,PAGE,"The Powers above would note the quoted text,"
1843,PAGE,"Nor heed the fact that while he prayed, he swore!"
1844,PAGE,"His keen eyes swept the veld, grave and perplexed."
1845,PAGE,"Two mules strayed fettered by the reim, outspanned,"
1846,PAGE,"A cart unhitched, stuck in the khaki sand."
1847,PAGE,
1848,PAGE,"Jan pulled his slouch hat down, and stroked his beard."
1849,PAGE,"The harsh birds croaked, the dingy clotted brown"
1850,PAGE,That stained the earth confirmed the tale he feared.
1851,PAGE,A woman in the burning dust stooped down
1852,PAGE,Over a crumpled figure; and a sheen
1853,PAGE,"Of golden tresses veiled it, like a screen."
1854,PAGE,
1855,PAGE,"She rocked her too and fro, a little breath"
1856,PAGE,"That might be song, or might be strangled word"
1857,PAGE,Broke from her now and then; but only death
1858,PAGE,"Lay in her arms and answered not, nor heard."
1859,PAGE,
1860,PAGE,"""Come away, come away,"
1861,PAGE,"Come, come, come away,"
1862,PAGE,"For the moon, for the moon"
1863,PAGE,Made a shroud in the day.
1864,PAGE,"Come away, come away, come, _come_, the moon,"
1865,PAGE,"The flowers are calling, Dick--my love, come soon."""
1866,PAGE,
1867,PAGE,Some hundred yards--Pah! Jan felt strangely sick--
1868,PAGE,"_She_ must have dragged that fearful thing away,"
1869,PAGE,The devil's brood had claimed. The Rooinek
1870,PAGE,Was safe. Heaven knew how desperate the fray!
1871,PAGE,"The fierce shot spent, the havoc, showed too well"
1872,PAGE,Her awful battle with those fiends from hell.
1873,PAGE,
1874,PAGE,He spoke her in the Taal; he touched her hand;
1875,PAGE,"She scarcely moved, but with a tear-stained smile"
1876,PAGE,"Babbled in words he could not understand,"
1877,PAGE,Nodding her head towards the plains the while.
1878,PAGE,"""The other one is dead. He was so black."
1879,PAGE,"He killed my husband, so I killed him back."
1880,PAGE,
1881,PAGE,"""I want to lay the moonflowers on Dick's breast,"
1882,PAGE,"They told me he was calling, so I came;"
1883,PAGE,"They kept on nodding, nodding to the west,"
1884,PAGE,"I want to have those moonflowers, the same"
1885,PAGE,That told me. Dick is dead. So cold and dead
1886,PAGE,I don't remember all the flowers said.
1887,PAGE,
1888,PAGE,"""But if we are not very quick, the shroud"
1889,PAGE,"Of silver cross-stitch, woven star on star,"
1890,PAGE,"Will be quite stolen by the thunder-cloud,"
1891,PAGE,"It's creeping, creeping, growling from afar."""
1892,PAGE,"""Ja, Ja,"" the old Boer nodded. ""Both are dead."""
1893,PAGE,"""One must be buried!"" so the good vrouw said."
1894,PAGE,
1895,PAGE,"They laboured hard to dig the white man's bed,"
1896,PAGE,"Jan Rissik and his trusty man and boys,"
1897,PAGE,Then laid him gently down. With prayer unsaid
1898,PAGE,"But beating at her throat, no word that cloys"
1899,PAGE,Or mars itself in speech--Beth flung the sod
1900,PAGE,Over her love--and left him there--with God.
1901,PAGE,
1902,PAGE,"Only a dusty mound to mark his grave,"
1903,PAGE,"A dream out-dreamed, a tiny buried cross"
1904,PAGE,"From off her neck. The Lord had called, who gave"
1905,PAGE,His rich Acceptance that the world deems loss!
1906,PAGE,"Father, forgive us! For our eyes that see"
1907,PAGE,Only our sorrows--when we should see Thee!
1908,PAGE,
1909,PAGE,*       *       *       *       *
1910,PAGE,
1911,PAGE,To Cellier's farm Jan Rissik trekked at morn.
