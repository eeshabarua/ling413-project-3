49,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"""Let's dance to the brown old earth to-night!"""
50,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,Cried one little flake of snow;
51,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"""The autumn days have all passed by,--"
52,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"I'm tired of my home here in the sky."""
53,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,So they all agreed to go.
54,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,
55,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,They dressed themselves in a misty film
56,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,Of purest pearly white;
57,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"Their feet were clad in velvet down,"
58,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,As soft and white as the filmy gown
59,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,They wore to the dance that night.
60,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,
61,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,Wrapped 'round with a drape of raveled gauze
62,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,Were these little fays so fair.
63,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"When out from a cloud a pale star beamed,"
64,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"Bright diamonds sparkled, laughed, and gleamed"
65,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"In their fleecy, tangled hair."
66,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,
67,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"All ready, so pretty a crowd were they"
68,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,That naught could their charms enhance;
69,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"Then softly and quickly they sped away,"
70,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,For the whisp'ring wind was the cab that they
71,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,Rode in to the snowflakes' dance.
72,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,
73,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"They flew over housetop, hilltop, dell,"
74,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,With dances and with delight.
75,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,Though ne'er did sound of their presence tell;
76,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"Wherever their fairy footsteps fell,"
77,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,All turned to a crystal white.
78,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,
79,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"In the daintiest robes the trees were dressed,"
80,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,That ever you'd wish to see;
81,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"The wayworn traveler, he was blessed,"
82,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"And stroked, and kissed, and soft-caressed,"
83,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,By these fays in rapturous glee.
84,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,
85,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"Into every crevice and crack they peeped,"
86,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,They danced till the morning light;
87,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,They left the print of their tiny feet
88,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"O'er country road and city street,"
89,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,In frolicsome fun that night.
90,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,
91,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,When the rosy face of the morning sun
92,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"Peeped timidly out to view,"
93,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,"He beheld the earth, last night so brown,"
94,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,Arrayed in a snow-white velvet gown
95,DANCE OF THE SNOWFLAKES.,That sparkled like dancing dew.

104,AN OCTOBER DAY.,All hail! thou lovely morn!
105,AN OCTOBER DAY.,"Thy tender blush, thy mellow light"
106,AN OCTOBER DAY.,"Proclaim ""The autumn's born."""
107,AN OCTOBER DAY.,"All nature is so wondrous fair,"

111,AN OCTOBER DAY.,
112,AN OCTOBER DAY.,The gold and crimson leaves that give
113,AN OCTOBER DAY.,"The trees their autumn gown,"

116,AN OCTOBER DAY.,Tho' summer flow'rs that were so fair
117,AN OCTOBER DAY.,"Have faded, one by one,"
118,AN OCTOBER DAY.,"The goldenrod, in beauty rare,"
119,AN OCTOBER DAY.,Her reign has just begun.
120,AN OCTOBER DAY.,
121,AN OCTOBER DAY.,The grapevines now are laden with
122,AN OCTOBER DAY.,"Sweet clusters, oh, so blue!"
123,AN OCTOBER DAY.,And scattered o'er the orchard ground
124,AN OCTOBER DAY.,"Are rosy apples, too."
125,AN OCTOBER DAY.,"Oh, who could sigh for summer skies,"
126,AN OCTOBER DAY.,"For summer flowers and trees,"
127,AN OCTOBER DAY.,"For singing birds and rainbow showers,"
128,AN OCTOBER DAY.,'Mid autumn scenes like these?
129,AN OCTOBER DAY.,
130,AN OCTOBER DAY.,"As sinks the glorious ""King of Day"""
131,AN OCTOBER DAY.,"Adown the western sky,"
132,AN OCTOBER DAY.,He bathes the trees and hilltops in
133,AN OCTOBER DAY.,A flood of crimson dye.
134,AN OCTOBER DAY.,He sets the westland all aglow
135,AN OCTOBER DAY.,Before he sinks away;

137,AN OCTOBER DAY.,This lovely autumn day.

295,THE CYCLONE.,"How still the morn! no leaf is stirred,"
296,THE CYCLONE.,"Nor fruited branches sway,"
297,THE CYCLONE.,"Save now and then, from dewy glen,"
298,THE CYCLONE.,"A breath of new-mown hay,"
299,THE CYCLONE.,"Or blossoms of the summertide,"
300,THE CYCLONE.,Is wafted up the mountain side.
301,THE CYCLONE.,
302,THE CYCLONE.,How softly floats the cuckoo's song
303,THE CYCLONE.,Across the sleeping vale;
304,THE CYCLONE.,In mystic glee the echo free
305,THE CYCLONE.,Gives back the fairy tale.
306,THE CYCLONE.,"The stream, in drowsy ecstasy,"
307,THE CYCLONE.,Is gurgling onward to the sea.
308,THE CYCLONE.,
309,THE CYCLONE.,"The lark swims slowly in the blue,"
310,THE CYCLONE.,"The giant oaks so high,"
311,THE CYCLONE.,"In sunlit haze their branches raise,"
312,THE CYCLONE.,As if to kiss the sky.
313,THE CYCLONE.,"We hear above the twittering birds,"
314,THE CYCLONE.,The placid lowing of the herds.
315,THE CYCLONE.,
316,THE CYCLONE.,The silvery laughter from the lips
317,THE CYCLONE.,Of children at their play;
318,THE CYCLONE.,And in the rill below the mill
319,THE CYCLONE.,The horses paw and neigh;
320,THE CYCLONE.,"While youths and maidens plight their vows,"

322,THE CYCLONE.,
323,THE CYCLONE.,"The noon is here, the sky is clear"
324,THE CYCLONE.,And tender as the morn;
325,THE CYCLONE.,"The ploughman's blest with perfect rest,"
326,THE CYCLONE.,Where noontime shade is born.
327,THE CYCLONE.,The bird has ceased his song to trill;
328,THE CYCLONE.,The lowing of the herd is still.
329,THE CYCLONE.,
330,THE CYCLONE.,"Unnoticed, a dark speck appears"
331,THE CYCLONE.,Above the trees!--on high
332,THE CYCLONE.,At rapid pace and fast increase
333,THE CYCLONE.,It scuds across the sky!
334,THE CYCLONE.,"Nor stops to rest o'er sea or lands,"
335,THE CYCLONE.,Till o'er this lovely vale it stands
336,THE CYCLONE.,
337,THE CYCLONE.,"An instant, then, as if possessed"
338,THE CYCLONE.,"Of some aerial deil,"
339,THE CYCLONE.,With shriek and yell this imp of hell
340,THE CYCLONE.,Swoops down upon the vale!
341,THE CYCLONE.,Snatches the giant oaks from earth
342,THE CYCLONE.,"That nourished them and gave them birth,"
343,THE CYCLONE.,
344,THE CYCLONE.,And hurls them 'gainst the mountain side!--
345,THE CYCLONE.,"One sweep of its black wings,"
346,THE CYCLONE.,And all is o'er! And as before
347,THE CYCLONE.,The streamlet laughs and sings;
348,THE CYCLONE.,But carries on its sunny tide
349,THE CYCLONE.,Fragments of debris to the wide
350,THE CYCLONE.,
351,THE CYCLONE.,"And surging sea,--the shattered boughs"
352,THE CYCLONE.,Of oaks that proudly grew
353,THE CYCLONE.,"Beside the stream,--is it a dream?"
354,THE CYCLONE.,"No, there's a baby's shoe!"
355,THE CYCLONE.,The sunset's crimson rays are shed
356,THE CYCLONE.,Soft o'er the dying and the dead.
357,THE CYCLONE.,
358,THE CYCLONE.,While angels hover near and spread
359,THE CYCLONE.,Their dewy shadows o'er
360,THE CYCLONE.,The vale where morn in joy was born--
361,THE CYCLONE.,A blackened pile! But for
362,THE CYCLONE.,"The song of one lone whip-poor-will,"
363,THE CYCLONE.,"Like to the morning, all is still!"

372,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,"The last glad sunbeams rest,"
373,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,Shedding their golden glories o'er
374,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,Her soft and silken breast.
375,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,
376,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,And as my little boat glides forth
377,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,"Into their light, behold!"
378,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,The splashes from my oars are like
379,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,Great drops of liquid gold.
380,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,
381,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,"And now a softer, richer hue"
382,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,O'erspreads the western sky;
383,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,"Trees, hilltops, water--everything"
384,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,Seems bathed in crimson dye.
385,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,
386,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,And o'er the bosom of the lake
387,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,"Soft summer breezes glide,"
388,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,Bringing incense from the lilies
389,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,On the other side.
390,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,
391,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,"I wonder, oh, I wonder so,"
392,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,If in that world of bliss
393,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,"Where sunsets never come, there's aught"

395,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,
396,SUNSET ON THE LAKE.,"Oh, Father Time, if thou from me"

574,THE PESSIMIST.,"And over each window in country and town,"
575,THE PESSIMIST.,"With fairy-like fingers, unheard and unseen,"
576,THE PESSIMIST.,"He pictures, in crystal and silvery sheen,"
577,THE PESSIMIST.,"Most beautiful cities with steeples and towers,"

579,THE PESSIMIST.,But 'mid the sweet music of jingling bells
580,THE PESSIMIST.,You hear the old pessimist counting his ills.
581,THE PESSIMIST.,"With a sorrowful shake of the head murmurs he,"
582,THE PESSIMIST.,"""Such nasty cold weather I never did see;"
583,THE PESSIMIST.,"The streets are so slip'ry one can't walk at all,"

587,THE PESSIMIST.,But roguish old Winter soon bundles his pack

589,THE PESSIMIST.,"And hies to the mountain, but leaves in his stead"
590,THE PESSIMIST.,"The Goddess of Love, with the blossom-crowned head;"
591,THE PESSIMIST.,"And a breath that is filled with the nectar and dew,"
592,THE PESSIMIST.,She stole from the heart of the violet blue;

594,THE PESSIMIST.,"From fresh-budding woodland, from hedge,--everywhere,"
595,THE PESSIMIST.,"Caressed by the sunlight and bathed by the showers,"
596,THE PESSIMIST.,She walks on a carpet of mosses and flowers.
597,THE PESSIMIST.,"Again comes the pessimist, grumpy and grim,"
598,THE PESSIMIST.,And says the fair goddess has no charms for him.
599,THE PESSIMIST.,"""'Tis raining too often, the corn and the wheat"
600,THE PESSIMIST.,Will rot in the ground; there'll be nothing to eat;
601,THE PESSIMIST.,"Besides, the old crow, in his greedy delight,"
602,THE PESSIMIST.,Now raideth the cornfields from morning till night.
603,THE PESSIMIST.,"A famine is certain! 'Tis sure to prevail!"""
604,THE PESSIMIST.,And thus the old pessimist keeps up his wail.
605,THE PESSIMIST.,"At last this fair goddess descends from the throne,"
606,THE PESSIMIST.,Gives place to another we've all loved and known.
607,THE PESSIMIST.,"Her crown is of roses, her garment of grain,"

612,THE PESSIMIST.,That drench all the trees and refresh all the flowers.
613,THE PESSIMIST.,"As softly they fall on the roof o'er our heads,"
614,THE PESSIMIST.,"O, the sleep-haunted rapture their lullaby sheds!"
615,THE PESSIMIST.,"Though harvest with plenty his gran'ries hath filled,"
616,THE PESSIMIST.,The murmuring pessimist never is stilled.
617,THE PESSIMIST.,"He says, as he brushes the sweat from his brow,"
