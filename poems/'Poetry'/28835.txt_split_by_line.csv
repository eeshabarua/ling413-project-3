32,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
33,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Sivard he a colt has got,"
34,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,The swiftest 'neath the sun;
35,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Proud Brynild from the Hill of Glass
36,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,In open day he won.
37,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
38,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Unto her did of knights and swains
39,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,The very flower ride;
40,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Not one of them the maid to win
41,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Could climb the mountain's side.
42,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
43,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,The hill it was both steep and smooth;
44,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Upon its lofty head
45,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Her sire had set her, knight nor swain"
46,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,He swore with her should wed.
47,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
48,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Soon to the Danish monarch's court
49,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"A messenger repaired,"
50,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,To know if there was any one
51,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,To try the adventure dared.
52,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
53,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"'Twas talked about, and Sivard then"
54,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,His purpose soon made known;
55,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Said he: ""I'll try upon my colt"
56,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"To bring Brynilda down."""
57,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
58,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"He rode away, the way was far,"
59,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,The path was of the worst;
60,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"He saw the shining Glass Hill, where"
61,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,The maid her durance curs'd.
62,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
63,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"And he away proud Brynild bore,"
64,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Nor deemed the adventure hard;
65,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,To bold Sir Nielus her he gave
66,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,To show him his regard.
67,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
68,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Proud Brynild and proud Signelil
69,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Those maids of beauteous mien,"
70,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Down to the river's side they went
71,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Their silken robes to clean.
72,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
73,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""Now do thou hear, thou proud Brynild,"
74,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"What now I say to thee,"
75,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Where didst thou get the bright gold ring
76,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"I on thy finger see?"""
77,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
78,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""How did I get the bright gold ring"
79,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Which on my hand you see?
80,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"That gave me Sivard Snareswayne,"
81,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"When he betrothed me."""
82,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
83,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""And though young Sivard gave thee that"
84,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"When he his love declar'd,"
85,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,He gives thee to Sir Nielus now
86,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"In proof of his regard."""
87,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
88,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"No sooner than did Brynild hear,"
89,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"The haughty hearted may,"
90,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Than to the chamber high she went,"
91,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Where sick of rage she lay.
92,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
93,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,It was the proud Brynild there
94,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Fell sick, and moaning lay;"
95,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,And her the proud Sir Nielus then
96,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Attended every day.
97,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
98,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""Now hark to me, thou Brynild fair,"
99,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,My mind is ill at ease;
100,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Know'st thou of any medicine
101,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Can cure thy sad disease?
102,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
103,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""If there be aught this world within"
104,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Can make thee cease to moan,"
105,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"That thou shalt have, e'en if it cost"
106,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"All, all the gold I own."""
107,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
108,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""I know of nought within this world"
109,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Can do my sickness good,"
110,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Except of Sivard Snareswayne
111,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,It be the hated blood.
112,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
113,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""And there is nothing in this world"
114,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Which can assuage my pain,"
115,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Except of Sivard Snareswayne
116,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"The head I do obtain."""
117,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
118,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""To draw of Sivard Snareswayne"
119,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,The blood I have no might;
120,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"His neck is hard as burnished steel,"
121,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"No sword thereon will bite."""
122,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
123,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""O hark, Sir Nielus, hark to me,"
124,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"My well beloved lord,"
125,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Borrow of him his Adelring,"
126,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,His famous trusty sword.
127,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
128,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""Tell him thou needest it so oft"
129,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"When thou dost wage a fight,"
130,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,But soon as 'tis within thy hand
131,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Hew off his head outright."""
132,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
133,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,It was the bold Sir Nielus then
134,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,His mantle puts he on;
135,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"To Sivard, his companion true,"
136,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,To the high hall he's gone.
137,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
138,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""Now hear, O Sivard Snareswayne,"
139,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Thy sword unto me lend,"
140,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,For I unto the field of fight
141,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Full soon my course must bend."""
142,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
143,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""My trusty faulchion Adelring"
144,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,I'll freely lend to thee;
145,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"No man be sure shall thee o'ercome,"
146,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,However strong he be.
147,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
148,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""My trusty faulchion Adelring"
149,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"To thee I'll freely yield,"
150,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"But, oh! beware thee of the tears"
151,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Beneath the hilt conceal'd.
152,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
153,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""Beware thee of those frightful tears,"
154,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,They all are bloody red;
155,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,If down thy fingers they should run
156,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Thou wert that moment dead."""
157,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
158,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Upstood the bold Sir Nielus then,"
159,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Drew out the sword amain;
160,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,One blow and off the head is hewn
161,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Of Sivard Snareswayne.
162,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
163,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Beneath his mantle then he takes
164,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"The head, distilling blood,"
165,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,And hurrying to the chamber high
166,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Before Brynilda stood.
167,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
168,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""Behold the head, the bloody head,"
169,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Thou didst so crave to gain;
170,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,For thee I've done a felon deed
171,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Which gives my heart such pain."""
172,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
173,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""O lay aside the bloody head,"
174,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,It fills my heart with fright;
175,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"And come to me, my dearest lord,"
176,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Beneath the linen white."""
177,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
178,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""I crave thee, woman, not to think"
179,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,I came for sport and play;
180,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Thou wast the wicked cause that I
181,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"From honour went astray."""
182,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
183,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,It was the bold Sir Nielus then
184,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,His faulchion he drew out;
185,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,It was the beauteous Brynild whom
186,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,He all to pieces smote.
187,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
188,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""Now have I slain my comrade dear,"
189,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"And eke my lovely may,"
190,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Yet still I am resolved in mind
191,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"A third, a third to slay."""
192,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
193,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,So then against the hard stone floor
194,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,He placed the trusty glaive;
195,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"To his heart's root the point in went,"
196,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,And him his death wound gave.
197,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
198,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,'Twere better that this maid had died
199,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Within her mother's womb,"
200,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Than that these princely men through her
201,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,To such an end should come.
202,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
203,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Now will I rede, each honest man"
204,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Well to deliberate ever;
205,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Unequalled woman's cunning is,"
206,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Though guiles of men be clever.
207,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
208,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"She laughs when 'tis her wish to laugh,"
209,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,And weeps when she will weep;
210,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Whene'er she wants thy heart to move
211,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Fair words on thee she'll heap.
212,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
213,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Be she sick, or be she well,"
214,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,In woman ne'er confide;
215,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"In murder red, by woman led,"
216,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,His hands Sir Nielus dyed.
217,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
218,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
219,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
220,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,
221,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER
222,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
223,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
224,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"See, see, with Queen Sophy sits Valdemar bold."
225,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,About little Kirsten much parlance they hold.
226,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
227,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Now hark, my good Lord! I have this to propose,"
228,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,That thou shalt give Kirsten to Buris for spouse.
229,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
230,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"A sister thou hast, I a brave brother own,"
231,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"A wedding we'll have ere this good year be flown."""
232,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
233,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""It never shall happen, as long as I live,"
234,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,That I to a horse-thief my sister will give.
235,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
236,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"My sister's a princess so fair and so bright,"
237,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"But Buris is liker a groom than a knight."""
238,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
239,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,Then pale as a corpse grew Sophia to see;
240,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""My noble lord, wherefore despisest thou me?"""
241,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
242,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,The Queen struck with fury her hand on the board:
243,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Be sure that I vengeance will have for that word."""
244,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
245,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"King Valdemar now to the war-field should wend,"
246,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,Behind stays Sir Buris the land to defend.
247,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
248,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Forth, forth from the land the bold King his course bent,"
249,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,So many a beautiful knight with him went.
250,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
251,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,Him followed so many a chivalrous band;
252,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"He disposed of his sister, the fair mirror's hand."
253,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
254,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To a prince rich and fine and of valour approved,"
255,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"He gave little Kirsten, his sister beloved."
256,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
257,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"With Buris Sophia sits over the board,"
258,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,And much brooded she on King Valdemar's word.
259,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
260,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Sir Buris, my brother, list thou to my say:"
261,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Beguile the King's sister whilst he is away."""
262,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
263,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,Sir Buris he cast on his sister his eyes:
264,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""O why my dear sister dost talk in this guise?"
265,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
266,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To do such an act I will never consent,"
267,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To make her my wife is my wish and intent."""
268,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
269,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,The Queen with her hand struck the table with force:
270,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Just, just as I bid thee direct thou thy course."""
271,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
272,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"His mantle of azure Sir Buris puts on,"
273,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,And unto the princess Sir Buris is gone.
274,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
275,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"With prayers late and early the maiden he tired,"
276,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,But could not obtain from her what he desired.
277,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
278,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Sir Buris, why seekest thou me to betray?"
279,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To my brother for this thou must answer some day."""
280,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
281,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"With ghastly white cheek did Sir Buris depart,"
282,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,The maiden he loved from the depths of his heart.
283,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
284,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Sir Buris flung on him his scarlet array,"
285,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,And unto Sophia with speed took his way:
286,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
287,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""The princess so firm and determined I find,"
288,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"No knight in this world can e'er conquer her mind."""
289,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
290,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""A pretty man, thou, to take love-work in hand,"
291,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"If the powerful Runes thou dost not understand."""
292,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
293,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""To the paths of fidelity I will return,"
294,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,No wish do I feel your Rune-magic to learn.
295,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
296,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"King Valdemar left his domain to my care,"
297,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Shall I in return his dear sister ensnare?"""
298,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
299,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""O I will for thee the Rune-characters trace,"
300,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"And thou them shalt cast in convenient place."""
301,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
302,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Sir Buris has cast the Rune-letters, alas,"
303,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,On the bridge over which little Kirsten should pass.
304,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
305,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Little Kirsten with anguish was filled, and with care,"
306,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,Must spite of herself to Sir Buris repair.
307,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
308,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,She knocked with her hand on the thick oaken door:
309,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Sir Buris, arise, let me into thy bower."""
310,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
311,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Upstood then Sir Buris, in scarlet array'd,"
312,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,And straight he admitted the beautiful maid.
313,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
314,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The whole night she lay in Sir Buris' embrace,"
315,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,All to her own sorrow and daily distress.
316,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
317,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Now on towards summer and autumn it drew,"
318,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,So stout in the waist little Kirsten she grew.
319,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
320,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,Her true waiting maid little Kirsten address'd:
321,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""To the chamber of stone now convey me in haste."
322,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
323,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,And there unto me do thou bring the mid-wife
324,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"But let not the Queen know thereof for thy life."""
325,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
326,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,To her little foot-swain little Kirsten did say:
327,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Fetch hither Sir Buris, withouten delay."""
328,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
329,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"They met on the lofty hall's high balcony,"
330,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,Together discoursed they so sorrowfully.
331,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
332,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"They gave then each other a tender caress,"
333,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,And swooned to the earth from of grief the excess.
334,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
335,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The year has revolved, and home now from the fray,"
336,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,King Valdemar cometh triumphant and gay.
337,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
338,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"In, in through the portal King Valdemar strode,"
339,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,Sophia received him in complaisant mode.
340,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
341,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,About and around him King Valdemar stared:
342,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Say! where is my sister, and how has she fared?"""
343,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
344,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,Then sly 'neath her scarlet laughed Sophy the Queen:
345,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""It is full three months now since thy sister I've seen."""
346,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
347,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Sophia exclaim'd: ""She is not to be taught,"
348,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"My advice and monition she holdeth at naught."""
349,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
350,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""O why dost thou thus of my sister complain?"
351,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"In honour she liv'd without ever a stain."""
352,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
353,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""The chamber of stone she has long made her home,"
354,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"There she of a little child light has become."""
355,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
356,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,Then the heart of the monarch was smitten with grief:
357,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""To thy words, O Sophia, I yield no belief."""
358,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
359,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""The blessed Lord's truth and no lie have I told,"
360,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"She invited me e'en her child-birth to behold."""
361,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
362,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,To five of his good knights spake sternly the King:
363,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Depart, and my sister straight home to me bring."""
364,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
365,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The knights rode away as King Valdemar said,"
366,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Much rather, much rather, would they have been dead."
367,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
368,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,They struck on the door 'neath their mantle of skin:
369,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Sweet princess Kirstina, arise, let us in."""
370,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
371,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,To the chamber straight came the true serving lass:
372,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""We crave thy leave into the chamber to pass."""
373,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
374,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""O sirs, ye may enter as free as the morn,"
375,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"For nobody here any baby has borne."""
376,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
377,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,Then in sorrowful mood good Sir Peter replied:
378,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""God grant that thy words I may see verified."""
379,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
380,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Arise, little Kirsten, thyself quick array,"
381,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,For thou to thy brother this night must away.
382,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,
