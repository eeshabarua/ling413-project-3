215,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,
216,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,
217,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,"In these rushful days an apology is advisable, if not absolutely"
218,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,"essential, from any man, save the one or two elect, who has the temerity"
219,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,to publish a volume of verse.
220,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,
221,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,"These stray lines, such as they are, have come to me from time to time,"
222,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,I hardly know how or whence; certainly not of deliberate intention or of
223,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,malice aforethought. More often than not they have come to the
224,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,"interruption of other, as it seemed to me, more important--and"
225,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,undoubtedly more profitable--work.
226,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,
227,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,"They are for the most part, simply attempts at concrete and"
228,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,"rememberable expression of ideas--ages old most of them--which ""asked"
229,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,"for more."""
230,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,
231,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,"Most writers, I imagine, find themselves at times in that same"
232,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,predicament--worried by some thought which dances within them and
233,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,stubbornly refuses to be satisfied with the sober dress of prose. For
234,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,"their own satisfaction and relief, in such a case, if they be not fools"
235,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,"they endeavour to garb it more to its liking, and so find peace. Or, to"
236,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,"vary the metaphor, they pluck the Bee out of their Bonnet and pop it"
237,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,into such amber as they happen to have about them or are able to
238,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,"evolve, and so put an end to its buzzing."
239,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,
240,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,In their previous states these little Bonnet-Bees of mine have
241,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,apparently given pleasure to quite a number of intelligent and
242,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,"thoughtful folk; and now--chiefly, I am bound to say, for my own"
243,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,satisfaction in seeing them all together--I have gathered
244,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,them into one bunch.
245,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,
246,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,"If they please you--good! If not, there is no harm done, and one man is"
247,AUTHOR'S APOLOGY,content.

367,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,
368,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,"The Mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding small--"
369,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,So soft and slow the great wheels go they scarcely move at all;
370,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,"But the souls of men fall into them and are powdered into dust,"
371,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,"And in that dust grow the Passion-Flowers--Love, Hope, Trust."
372,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,
373,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,"Most wondrous their upspringing, in the dust of the Grinding-Mills,"
374,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,And rare beyond the telling the fragrance each distils.
375,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,"Some grow up tall and stately, and some grow sweet and small,"
376,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,But Life out of Death is in each one--with purpose grow they all.
377,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,
378,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,"For that dust is God's own garden, and the Lord Christ tends it fair,"
379,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,"With oh, such loving tenderness! and oh, such patient care!"
380,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,"In sorrow the seeds are planted, they are watered with bitter tears,"
381,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,But their roots strike down to the Water-Springs and the Sources of the
382,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,Years.
383,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,
384,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,"These flowers of Christ's own providence, they wither not nor die,"
385,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,"But flourish fair, and fairer still, through all eternity."
386,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,"In the Dust of the Mills and in travail the amaranth seeds are sown,"
387,FLOWERS OF THE DUST,But the Flowers in their full beauty climb the Pillars of the Throne.

430,EVERYMAID,"With clang and clamour,"
431,EVERYMAID,"Traffic of rude voices,"
432,EVERYMAID,"Clink of steel on stone,"
433,EVERYMAID,And din of hammer;--
434,EVERYMAID,Not so the temple of thy grace is reared.
435,EVERYMAID,"But,--in the inmost shrine"
436,EVERYMAID,"Must thou begin,"
437,EVERYMAID,And build with care
438,EVERYMAID,"A Holy Place,"
439,EVERYMAID,"A place unseen,"
440,EVERYMAID,Each stone a prayer.
441,EVERYMAID,"Then, having built,"
442,EVERYMAID,Thy shrine sweep bare
443,EVERYMAID,"Of self and sin,"
444,EVERYMAID,And all that might demean;
445,EVERYMAID,"And, with endeavour,"
446,EVERYMAID,"Watching ever, praying ever,"
447,EVERYMAID,"Keep it fragrant-sweet, and clean:"
448,EVERYMAID,"So, by God's grace, it be fit place,--"
449,EVERYMAID,His Christ shall enter and shall dwell therein.
450,EVERYMAID,Not as in earthly fane--where chase
451,EVERYMAID,Of steel on stone may strive to win
452,EVERYMAID,"Some outward grace,--"

1951,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,
1952,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,And the first man they would bury there

1992,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,

2007,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,
2008,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,"Since earth his body would not,"

2012,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,
2013,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,So the soul of Judas Iscariot
2014,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,"Came by the Potter's Field,"
2015,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,And there the ill his deed had wrought

2017,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,
2018,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,"And when the others saw him,"

2022,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,

2026,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,"Grim, and stiff, and stark."
2027,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,
2028,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,"They struck at him with their bodies,"
2029,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,"They cursed him for his sin,"
2030,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,"They made to tear his dumb soul there,"
2031,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,With their fingers long and lean.
2032,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,
2033,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,"And Judas fled in his horror,"
2034,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,"With that fell crew behind,"
2035,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,And as they sped the people said
2036,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,Death rode upon the wind.
2037,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,
2038,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,"They chased him near, they chased him far,"

2047,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,
2048,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,"And as they sped by Calvary,"
2049,THE BALLAD OF LOST SOULS,"There were empty crosses three,--"

2308,THE GATE,
2309,THE GATE,
2310,THE GATE,"I trod an arduous way, but came at last"
2311,THE GATE,To where the city walls rose fair and white
2312,THE GATE,"Above the darkening plain,--a goodly sight."
2313,THE GATE,"And eagerly, while yet a great way off,"
2314,THE GATE,My eyes did seek the Gates--the Great White Gates
2315,THE GATE,"That close not ever, day or night, but stand"
2316,THE GATE,Wide as the love of Christ that opened them.
2317,THE GATE,"But nought could I discern of gate or breach,"
2318,THE GATE,The wall stood flawless far as eye could reach.
2319,THE GATE,
2320,THE GATE,"""But when I drew in closer to the wall,"
2321,THE GATE,"I saw a lowly portal, strait and small;"
2322,THE GATE,"So small, a man might hardly enter there,"
2323,THE GATE,"Low-browed and shadowed, and close-pressed to earth--"
2324,THE GATE,A very needle's eye--scarce visible.
2325,THE GATE,I looked and wondered. Could this trivial way
2326,THE GATE,Be the sole entrance to the light of day?
2327,THE GATE,"And as I stood perplext, a clear voice cried,--"
2328,THE GATE,"_Come! Enter in! The Gate is open wide_."""
2329,THE GATE,
2330,THE GATE,"And while I stood in doubt, there came along"
2331,THE GATE,One of earth's mighty ones--a conqueror
2332,THE GATE,Of Kings. He looked for gates that should swing wide
2333,THE GATE,To meet his high estate and welcome him.
2334,THE GATE,"He stood and gazed, then raised his voice and cried,"
2335,THE GATE,"""My work on earth is done. I would within,"""
2336,THE GATE,"And from the City wall the voice replied,--"
2337,THE GATE,"""_Come! Enter in! The Gate is open wide_."""
2338,THE GATE,"He stood perplext, then set himself to wait,"
2339,THE GATE,Till Might should help him to discern the Gate.
2340,THE GATE,
2341,THE GATE,"Another came,--a man of mind so rare,"
2342,THE GATE,He scarce had breathed the common earthly air.
2343,THE GATE,"Knowledge was his, and wisdom so profound,"
2344,THE GATE,All things he knew in heaven and earth. No bound
2345,THE GATE,"To his accomplishment, until he sought"
2346,THE GATE,"The great wide-opened Gate,--and found it not."
2347,THE GATE,"He stood perplext, and then cried wearily,"
2348,THE GATE,"""Pray give me entrance. I am done with earth."""
2349,THE GATE,"And from the City wall the clear voice cried,--"
2350,THE GATE,"""_Come! Enter in! The Gate is open wide_."""
2351,THE GATE,"He looked in vain, then set himself to wait,"
2352,THE GATE,Till Wisdom should direct him to the gate.
2353,THE GATE,
2354,THE GATE,"I saw a woman come, noble and fair,"
2355,THE GATE,"And pure of heart, and in her goodly deeds"
2356,THE GATE,More richly robed than Fashion's fairest queen.
2357,THE GATE,"And to myself I said,--""Surely for her"
2358,THE GATE,"A way will open that she may go in!"""
2359,THE GATE,"She said no word, but stood and looked upon"
2360,THE GATE,"The shining walls, with eyes that answering shone."
2361,THE GATE,"And from the City wall the clear voice cried,--"
2362,THE GATE,"""_Come! Enter in! The Gate is open wide_."""
2363,THE GATE,"She looked in vain, then set herself to wait,"
2364,THE GATE,Till Love should help her to discern the Gate.
2365,THE GATE,
2366,THE GATE,"And one there came, with clear keen face--a Judge"
2367,THE GATE,"Of men on earth, and famed for fearless truth."
2368,THE GATE,His robes were stainless and his heart was clean.
2369,THE GATE,"""Entrance I crave,"" he cried, ""to well-earned rest,--"
2370,THE GATE,"And mercy-tempered justice and no more."""
2371,THE GATE,"And from the City wall the clear voice cried,--"

2373,THE GATE,"He looked in vain, then set himself to wait"
2374,THE GATE,Till Judgment should direct him to the Gate.
2375,THE GATE,
2376,THE GATE,"And one there came, sad-eyed, his brow still raw"
2377,THE GATE,From pressure of an earthly crown. He too
2378,THE GATE,"Sought glorious entrance through wide-opened gates,"
2379,THE GATE,"And stood perplext. He had borne well his part,"
2380,THE GATE,"And served his people and his God, and died"
2381,THE GATE,"The Martyr's death, and yet he found no gate."
2382,THE GATE,"""I fain would rest,"" he cried. ""My life has been"
2383,THE GATE,"One ceaseless striving. I would enter in."""
2384,THE GATE,"And from the City wall the clear voice cried,--"
2385,THE GATE,"""_Come! Enter in! The Gate is open wide_."""
2386,THE GATE,"Perplext he stood, then set himself to wait,"
2387,THE GATE,Till Patient Waiting should discern the Gate.
2388,THE GATE,
2389,THE GATE,"And one who had had riches beyond most,"
2390,THE GATE,"And yet subserved them to his Master's good,"
2391,THE GATE,"Came searching for the heavenly gates, and stood"
2392,THE GATE,Amazed to find no opening in the walls.
2393,THE GATE,"""I gave of all I had,"" he cried, ""and held"
2394,THE GATE,"Nought as my own,--yet entrance is denied."""
2395,THE GATE,"And from the City wall the clear voice cried,--"
2396,THE GATE,"""_Come! Enter in! The Gate is open wide_."""
2397,THE GATE,"He stood perplext, then set himself to wait"
2398,THE GATE,Till Charity should point him to the Gate.
2399,THE GATE,
2400,THE GATE,"And many more there were who entrance craved,"
2401,THE GATE,"And sought the Great White Gates, and stood perplext."
2402,THE GATE,"And ever, from within, the clear voice cried,--"
2403,THE GATE,"""_Come! Enter in! The Gate is open wide_."""
2404,THE GATE,"They sought in vain, and set themselves to wait"
2405,THE GATE,Till Light was given them to discern the Gate.
2406,THE GATE,
2407,THE GATE,And then--a child in white came carolling
2408,THE GATE,Along the arduous road we all had trod.
2409,THE GATE,"He stopped and looked, then laughed with childish glee,--"
2410,THE GATE,"""_Why wait ye here without? Come, follow me_!""--"
2411,THE GATE,"And passed, scarce bending, through the lowly door,--"
2412,THE GATE,"We heard his singing,--him we saw no more."
2413,THE GATE,
2414,THE GATE,"The woman stooped and looked, with eyes that shone,"
2415,THE GATE,Into the doorway where the child had gone;
2416,THE GATE,"Then loosed her robes and dropped, and in a shift"
2417,THE GATE,"Of pure white samite, on her hands and knees"
2418,THE GATE,"She crept into the doorway and was gone,"
2419,THE GATE,And we stood gazing at the way she went.
2420,THE GATE,
2421,THE GATE,"And, one by one, they followed. First the Judge"
2422,THE GATE,"Laid by his robes, and bowed him to the ground,"
2423,THE GATE,And followed--where the little child had led.
2424,THE GATE,And he whose brow had borne that weighty crown
2425,THE GATE,"Bent low and followed,--where the little child had led."
2426,THE GATE,And he who knew so much of earthly things
2427,THE GATE,"Discarded them, and, on his hands and knees,"
2428,THE GATE,"Crept through the doorway,--where the little child had led."
2429,THE GATE,And he of riches laid him in the dust
2430,THE GATE,"And followed,--where the little child had led."
2431,THE GATE,"And, last of all, the War Lord cast aside"
2432,THE GATE,"His victor's wreaths, and all his pomp and pride,"
2433,THE GATE,"And followed,--where the little child had led."
2434,THE GATE,"And, groping through my fears, I bowed my head"
2435,THE GATE,"And followed,--where the little child had led."

2993,KAPIOLANI,"Louder still and louder, Pélé roars within her lake of fire,"
2994,KAPIOLANI,"And the youths and maidens trembling look in fear up Mauna Loa,"
2995,KAPIOLANI,Dreading sight of that grim figure stalking down the mountain side;
2996,KAPIOLANI,For when Pélé claims her victims none the summons may avoid.
2997,KAPIOLANI,"Pélé calls for whom she chooses--whom she chooses goes,--and dies."
2998,KAPIOLANI,
2999,KAPIOLANI,"See! He comes! They start in terror. There, along the mountain side,"
3000,KAPIOLANI,"Death comes stalking, slowly, surely,--_Pélé must be satisfied_."
3001,KAPIOLANI,"Which among them will he summon, with his dreadful pointing finger?"
3002,KAPIOLANI,"All their hearts become as water, all their faces blanch with fear,"

3012,KAPIOLANI,
3013,KAPIOLANI,"Slowly points the dreadful finger, marks the newly-wedded bride;"
3014,KAPIOLANI,"All the rest, save one, fall from her, as the living from the dead."
3015,KAPIOLANI,From the first of time's beginnings Pélé ne'er has been gainsayed;
3016,KAPIOLANI,"Pélé chooses whom she chooses, each and all the choice abide,"
3017,KAPIOLANI,"For the common good and safety,--_Pélé must be satisfied_!"
3018,KAPIOLANI,
3019,KAPIOLANI,"Still the mountain reels and shudders, still the awful thunders peal,"
3020,KAPIOLANI,Like a snake the ruthless finger holds them all in terror still;
3021,KAPIOLANI,"One is there whose life is broken, parted from his chosen bride,"
3022,KAPIOLANI,"But the threatening finger, heedless of the lives it may divide,"
3023,KAPIOLANI,"Lights upon a tiny maiden,--_Pélé must be satisfied_!"
3024,KAPIOLANI,
3025,KAPIOLANI,"Slow, the grim high-priest of Pélé turns to climb the mountain side;"

3027,KAPIOLANI,"And the rest shrink, dumb and helpless, daring not to lift an eye,"
3028,KAPIOLANI,"And beyond, the labouring mountain cracks and belches living fires,"
3029,KAPIOLANI,Till the island reels and shudders at dread Pélé's agonies.
3030,KAPIOLANI,
3031,KAPIOLANI,But a greater one than Pélé walked the mountain side that day;--
3032,KAPIOLANI,"To them, climbing, dumb and dim-eyed--like a flash of heavenly flame,"
3033,KAPIOLANI,"Swift and bright as saving angel, fair Kapiolani came,"
3034,KAPIOLANI,"Swiftly as a saving angel, gleaming like a heavenly flame,"
3035,KAPIOLANI,"Thirsting like a sword for battle, fair Kapiolani came."
3036,KAPIOLANI,
3037,KAPIOLANI,"Radiant with the faith of martyrs, all aglow with new-born zeal,"
3038,KAPIOLANI,"Burning to release the people from the bondage and the thrall,"
3039,KAPIOLANI,"From the deadly thrall of Pélé, from the ever-threatening doom,"
3040,KAPIOLANI,"From the everlasting menace, from the awful lake of fire,"
3041,KAPIOLANI,Like a bright avenging angel fair Kapiolani came!
3042,KAPIOLANI,
3043,KAPIOLANI,"""Hear me now, you priest of Pélé, and ye men of Owhyhee!"
3044,KAPIOLANI,"Hearken! ye who cringe and tremble, at the sound of Kilauea,"

3052,KAPIOLANI,"So let every scoffer perish!--Pélé! Pélé! Pélé! come!"""
3053,KAPIOLANI,"And Kapiolani answered--""Pélé! Pélé! Pélé! come!"""
3054,KAPIOLANI,
3055,KAPIOLANI,Loud the mountain roared and thundered; shuddered all who heard and
3056,KAPIOLANI,"saw,"
3057,KAPIOLANI,"Dauntless stood Kapiolani, dauntless with her faithful few."
3058,KAPIOLANI,"""Come!"" she cried again. ""Come, Pélé! Smite me with thy dreadful doom!"
3059,KAPIOLANI,"I am waiting, mighty Pélé!--Pélé! Pélé! Pélé! come!"""
3060,KAPIOLANI,And the mountain roared and thundered;--but the goddess did not come.
3061,KAPIOLANI,
3062,KAPIOLANI,"""Hearken, Priest! You have deceived us. All your life has been a lie,"
3063,KAPIOLANI,"Black your heart is, red your hands are, with the blood of those who"
3064,KAPIOLANI,die.
3065,KAPIOLANI,All these years you have misled us with your awful threats of doom.
3066,KAPIOLANI,"Now it ends! I do defy you, and your goddess I defy."
3067,KAPIOLANI,"Pélé, is not, never has been. All your worship is a lie."
3068,KAPIOLANI,
3069,KAPIOLANI,"""I will climb your sacred mountain. I will dare your lake of fire."
3070,KAPIOLANI,"I will eat your sacred berries. I will dare your goddess there,"
3071,KAPIOLANI,"There and then to wreak her vengeance, then and there to come in fire,"
3072,KAPIOLANI,"And with awful burnings end me, now and for eternity;"
3073,KAPIOLANI,"But if Pélé does not end me, then her worship ends this day."""
3074,KAPIOLANI,
3075,KAPIOLANI,Then the great high priest of Pélé turned to fiery Kilauea.
3076,KAPIOLANI,"""Come!"" he said, ""the goddess calls you!""--and they climbed the"
3077,KAPIOLANI,"mountain side,"
3078,KAPIOLANI,"Up the slopes of Mauna Loa, to the hell of Kilauea,"
3079,KAPIOLANI,"With the bright blue sky above them, with the blazing sun above them,"
3080,KAPIOLANI,"While the mountain shook beneath them, and its head was wrapped in"
3081,KAPIOLANI,fire.
3082,KAPIOLANI,
3083,KAPIOLANI,"Fearful, hopeful, all the people crept along the shaking path,"
3084,KAPIOLANI,"Hardly breathing at their daring, thus to brave dread Pélé's wrath,"
3085,KAPIOLANI,"Bending low lest she should see them, breathing soft lest she should"
3086,KAPIOLANI,"hear,"
3087,KAPIOLANI,"Certain that Kapiolani would be sacrificed that day,"
3088,KAPIOLANI,"To the vengeance of the goddess, to the anger of Pélé."

3109,KAPIOLANI,"Climbed the side of Mauna Loa, to the dreadful lake of fire,"
3110,KAPIOLANI,"While the mountain shook and thundered, while the people blanched and"
