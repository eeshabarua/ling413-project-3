137,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"[Greek: eisi gar oun, oi en tas phuchais kuousin]"
138,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
139,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Plato
140,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
141,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,The supreme problem of every age is that of finding its consummate
142,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,artistic expression. Before this problem every other remains of
143,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"secondary importance. History defines and directs its physical course,"
144,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"science cooperates in the achievement of its material aims, but Art"
145,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"alone gives to the age its spiritual physiognomy, its ultimate and"
146,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,lasting expression.
147,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
148,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"The process of Art is on the one hand sensuous, the conception having"
149,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,for its basis the fineness of organization of the senses; and on the
150,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"other hand it is severely scientific, the value of the creation being"
151,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"dependent upon the craftsmanship, the mastery over the tool, the"
152,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,technique.
153,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
154,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Art, like Nature, its great and only reservoir for all time past and all"
155,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"time to come, ever strives for elimination and selection. It is severe"
156,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,and aristocratic in the application of its laws and impervious to appeal
157,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,to serve other than its own aims. Its purpose is the symbolization of
158,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Life. In its sanctum there reigns the silence of vast accomplishment,"
159,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"the serene, final, and imperturbable solitude which is the ultimate"
160,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,criterion of all great things created.
161,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
162,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"To speak of Poetry is to speak of the most subtle, the most delicate,"
163,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,and the most accurate instrument by which to measure Life.
164,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
165,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Poetry is reality's essence visioned and made manifest by one endowed
166,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"with a perception acutely sensitive to sound, form, and colour, and"
167,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,gifted with a power to shape into rhythmic and rhymed verbal symbols the
168,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,reaction to Life's phenomena. The poet moulds that which appears
169,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,evanescent and ephemeral in image and in mood into everlasting values.
170,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,In this act of creation he serves eternity.
171,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
172,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Poetry, in especial lyrical poetry, must be acknowledged the supreme"
173,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"art, culminating as it does in a union of the other arts, the musical,"
174,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"the plastic, and the pictorial."
175,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
176,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"The most eminent contemporary poets of Europe have, each in accordance"
177,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"with his individual temperament, reflected in their work the spiritual"
178,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"essence of our age, its fears and failures, its hopes and high"
179,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"achievements: Maeterlinck, with his mood of resignation and his"
180,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,retirement into a dusky twilight where his shadowy figures move
181,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"noiselessly like phantoms in fate-laden dimness; Dehmel, the worshipper"
182,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"of will, with his passion for materiality and the beauty of all things"
183,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"physical and tangible; Verhaeren, the visionary of a new vitality, who"
184,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,sees in the toilers of fields and factories the heroic gesture of our
185,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,time and who might have written its great epic of industry but for the
186,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,overwhelming lyrical mood of his soul.
187,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
188,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Until a few years ago, known only to a relatively small community on the"
189,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,continent but commanding an ever increasing attention which has borne
190,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"his name far beyond the boundary of his country, the personality of"
191,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Rainer Maria Rilke stands to-day beside the most illustrious poets of
192,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,modern Europe.

194,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,*       *       *       *       *
195,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
196,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,The background against which the figure of Rainer Maria Rilke is
197,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"silhouetted is so varied, the influences which have entered into his"
198,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"life are so manifold, that a study of his work, however slight, must"
199,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,needs take into consideration the elements through which this poet has
200,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,matured into a great master.
201,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
202,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Prague, the city in which Rilke was born in 1875, with its sinister"
203,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,palaces and crumbling towers that rose in the early Middle Ages and have
204,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,reached out into our time like the threatening fingers of mighty hands
205,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,which have wielded swords for generations and which are stained with the
206,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,blood of many wounds of many races; the city where amid grey old ruins
207,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,blonde maidens are at play or are lost in reverie in the green cool
208,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"parks and shady gardens with which the Bohemian capital abounds, this"
209,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Prague of mingled grotesqueness and beauty gave to the young boy his
210,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,first impressions.
211,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
212,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,There is a period in the life of every artist when his whole being seems
213,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"lost in a contemplation of the surrounding world, when the application"
214,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"to work is difficult, like the violent forcing of something that is"
215,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"awaiting its time. This is the time of his dream, as sacred as the days"
216,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,of early spring before wind and rain and light have touched the fruits
217,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"of the fields, when there is a tense bleak silence over the whole of"
218,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"nature, in which is wrapped the strength of storms and the glow of the"
219,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"summer's sun. This is the time of his deepest dream, and upon this dream"
220,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,and its guarding depends the final realization of his life's work.
221,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
222,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,The young graduate of the Gymnasium was to enter upon the career of an
223,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"army officer in accordance with the traditions of the family, an old"
224,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,noble house which traces its lineage far back to Carinthian ancestry.
225,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"His inclinations, however, pointed so decisively in the direction of the"
226,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,finer arts of life that he left the Military Academy after a very short
227,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,attendance to devote himself to the study of philosophy and the history
228,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,of art.
229,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
230,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"As one turns the pages of Rilke's first small book of poems, published"
231,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"originally under the title _Larenopfer_, in the year 1895, and which"
232,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,appeared in more recent editions under the less descriptive name _Erste
233,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Gedichte_, one realizes at once, in spite of a lack of plasticity in the"
234,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"presentation, that here speaks one who has lingered long and lovingly"
235,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"over the dream of his boyhood. As the title indicates, these poems are a"
236,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"tribute, an offering to the Lares, the home spirits of his native town."
237,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Prague and the surrounding country are the ever recurring theme of
238,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"almost every one of these poems. The meadows, the maidens, the dark"
239,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"river in the evening, the spires of the cathedral at night rising like"
240,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"grey mists are seen with a wonderment, the great well-spring of all"
241,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"poetic imagination, with a well-nigh religious piety. Through all these"
242,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,poems there sounds like a subdued accompaniment a note of gratitude for
243,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"the ability to thus vision the world, to be sunk in the music of all"
244,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"things. ""Without is everything that I feel within myself, and without"
245,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"and within myself everything is immeasurable, illimitable."""
246,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
247,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,These pictures of town and landscape are never separated from their
248,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,personal relation to the poet. He feels too keenly his dependence upon
249,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"them, as a child views flowers and stars as personal possessions. Not"
250,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,until later was he to reach the height of an impersonal objectivity in
251,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,his art. What distinguishes these early poems from similar adolescent
252,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"productions is the restraint in the presentation, the economy and"
253,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,intensity of expression and that quality of listening to the inner voice
254,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,of things which renders the poet the seer of mankind.
255,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
256,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,The second book of poems appeared two years later and like the first
257,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,volume _Traumgekrönt_ is full of the music that is reminiscent of the
258,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"mild melancholy of the Bohemian folk-songs, in whose gentle rhythms the"
259,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,barbaric strength of the race seems to be lulled to rest as the waves of
260,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,a far-away tumultuous sea gently lap the shore. The themes of
261,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,_Traumgekrönt_ are extended somewhat beyond the immediate environment
262,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,of Prague and some of the most beautiful poems are luminous pictures of
263,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"villages hidden in the snowy blossoming of May and June, out of which"
264,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,rises here and there the solitary soft voice of a boy or girl singing.
265,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"In these first two volumes the poet is satisfied with painting in words,"
266,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"full of sonorous beauty, the surrounding world. From this period dates"
267,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"the small poem _Evening_, which seems to have been sketched by a"
268,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Japanese painter, so clear and colourful is its texture, so precious and"
269,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,precise are its outlines.
270,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
271,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"With _Advent_ and _Mir Zur Feier_, both published within the following"
272,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"three years, a phase of questioning commences, a dim desire begins to"
273,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"stir to reach out into the larger world ""deep into life, out beyond"
274,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"time."" Whereas the early poems were characterized by a tendency to turn"
275,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"away from the turmoil of life--in fact, the concrete world of reality"
276,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,does not seem to exist--there is noticeable in these two later volumes
277,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,an advance toward life in the sense that the poet is beginning to
278,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,approach and to vision some of its greatest symbols.
279,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
280,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Throughout the entire work of Rilke, in his poetry as well as in his"
281,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"interpretations of painting and sculpture, there are two elements that"
282,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"constitute the cornerstones in the structure of his art. If, as has been"
283,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"said with a degree of verity, Nietzsche was primarily a musician whose"
284,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,philosophy had for its basis and took its ultimate aspects from the
285,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"musical quality of his artistic endowment, it may be maintained with an"
286,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,equal amount of truth that Rilke is primarily a painter and sculptor
287,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,whose poetry rests upon the fundaments of the pictorial and plastic
288,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,arts.
289,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
290,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Up to the time of the publication of these volumes, Rilke's poems"
291,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"possessed a quietude, a stillness suggested in the straight unbroken yet"
292,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"delicate lines of the picture which he portrays and in the soft, almost"
293,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"unpulsating rhythm of his words. The approach of evening or nightfall,"
294,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"the coming of dawn, the change of the seasons, the slow changes of light"
295,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"into darkness and of darkness into light, in short, the most silent yet"
296,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,greatest metamorphoses in the external aspects of nature form the
297,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,contents of many of these first poems. The inanimate object and the
298,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,living creature in nature are not seen in the sharp contours of their
299,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,isolation; they are viewed and interpreted in the atmosphere that
300,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"surrounds them, in which they are enwrapped and so densely veiled that"
301,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"the outlines are only dimly visible, be that atmosphere the mystic grey"
302,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,of northern twilight or the dark velvety blue of southern summer nights.
303,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"In _Advent_, the experience of the atmosphere becomes an experience in"
304,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"his innermost soul and, therefore, all things become of value to him"
305,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"only in so far as they partake of the atmosphere, as they are seen in a"
306,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,peculiar air and distance. This first phase in Rilke's work may be
307,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,defined as the phase of reposeful nature.
308,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
309,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,To this sphere of relaxation and restfulness in which the objects are
310,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"static and are changed only as the surrounding atmosphere affects them,"
311,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"the second phase in the poet's development adds another element, which"
312,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"later was to grow into dimensions so powerful, so violently breaking"
313,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,beyond the limitations of simple expression in words that it could only
314,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,find its satisfaction in a dithyrambic hymn to the work of the great
315,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"plastic artist of our time, to the creations of Auguste Rodin. This"
316,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,second element is that which the French sculptor in a different medium
317,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"has carried to perfection. It is the element of gesture, of dramatic"
318,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,movement.
319,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
320,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,This might seem the appropriate place in which to speak of Rilke's
321,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"monograph on the art of Rodin. To do so would, however, be an undue"
322,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"anticipation, for it will be necessary to trace Rilke's development"
323,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,through several transitions before the value of his contact with the
324,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,work of Rodin can be fully measured.
325,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
326,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"The gesture, the movement begins in _Advent_ and _Celebration_ to"
327,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,disturb the stillness prevailing in the first two volumes of poems. Even
328,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,here it is only gentle and shy at first like the stirring of a breath of
329,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"wind over a quiet sea; and gentle beings make this first gesture,"
330,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"children and young women at play, singing, dancing or at prayer."
331,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
332,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Particularly in the cycle _Songs of the Maidens_ in the book
333,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"_Celebration_, the atmosphere is condensed and becomes the psychic"
334,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,background of the landscape against which the gesture of longing or
335,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,expectation is seen and felt. It is the impatience to burst into
336,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"blossoming, the longing for love which pulsates in these _Songs of the"
337,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Maidens_ with the tenseness of suspense. _The Prayers of the Maidens to
338,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Mary_ have not the mild melody of maidenly prayer; they vibrate with the
339,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"ecstasy of expectant life, and the Madonna is more than the Heavenly"
340,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Virgin, their longing transforms her into the symbol of earthly love and"
341,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"motherhood. This expectation, in spite of its intensity, is subdued and"
342,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,is only heard like the cadence of a far off dream:
343,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
344,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"""How shall I go on tiptoe"
345,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,From childhood to Annunciation
346,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Through the dim twilight
347,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Into Thy Garden?"""
348,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
349,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Mention should be made of some prose writings which Rilke published in
350,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"the year 1898 and shortly afterward. They are _Two Stories of Prague_,"
351,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,_The Touch of Life_ and _The Last_; three volumes of short stories; a
352,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"two-act drama, _The Daily Life_, points to a strong Maeterlinck"
353,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"influence, and finally _Stories of God_. With both beauty of detail and"
354,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"problematic interest, the short stories show an incoherence of treatment"
355,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,and a lack of dramatic co-ordination easily conceivable in a poet who is
356,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,essentially lyrical and who at that time had not mastered the means of
357,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,technique to give to his characters the clear chiselling of the epic
358,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,form.

362,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,A sojourn in Russia and especially the acquaintance with the novels of
363,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Dostoievsky became potent factors in Rilke's development and served to
364,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,deepen creations which without this influence might have terminated in a

367,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Broadly speaking, Russian art and literature may be described as"

369,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"and _raison d'être_ the tendency toward socio-political reform, in"
370,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"contradistinction to the art and literature of Western culture, whose"
371,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,motives and aims are primarily of an æsthetic nature and seek in art the

377,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"most tortured expression is its seeming immobility, the suddenly"
378,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"interrupted impulse, the life hardened into a stone:"" this Dostoievsky"
379,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,and particularly his _Rodion Raskolnikov_ cycle became a profound

381,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"received for him a new significance, the significance of the isolated"
382,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,figure placed in the mighty everchanging current of a life in which this
383,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,figure stands strong and solitary. In the poem entitled _Pont Du
384,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Carrousel_, written in Paris a few years later, Rilke has visioned the"

389,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,that comes infinitely slowly to those who have patience. Russia is the

399,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,In the first decade of the new century Rilke reached the height of his
400,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,art and with a few exceptions the poems represented in this volume are
401,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,selected from the poems which were published between the years 1900 and
402,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,1908. The ascent toward the acme of Rilke's art after the year 1900 is
403,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,as rapid as it is precipitous. Only a few years previous we read in
404,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Advent:
405,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
406,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"""That is longing: To dwell in the flux of things,"

411,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"With _Das Buch der Bilder_ the dream is ended, the veil of mist is"
412,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,lifted and before us are revealed pictures and images that rise before
413,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,our eyes in clear colourful contours. Whether the poet conjures from the
414,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"depths of myth _The Kings in Legends_, or whether we read from _The"
415,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Chronicle of a Monk_ the awe-inspiring description of _The Last Judgment

420,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,It is a significant fact that Rilke dedicated this book to Gerhart
421,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Hauptmann, ""in love and gratitude for his Michael Kramer."" Hauptmann,"
422,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"like Rilke in these poems, has placed before us great epic figures and"
423,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,his art is so concentrated that often the simple expression of the
424,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,thought of one of his characters produces a shudder in the listener or
425,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,reader because in this thought there vibrates the suffering of an entire

430,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"In _The Book of Pictures_, Rilke's art reaches its culmination on what"
431,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,might be termed its monumental side. The visualization is elevated to
432,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,the impersonal objective level which gives to the rhythm of these poems
433,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"an imperturbable calm, to the figures presented a monumental erectness."

454,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,aspiration reaching into the far distant silence of the night; or as in

457,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
458,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"In _The Book of Hours_, Rilke withdraws from the world not from"
459,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,weariness but weighed down under the manifold conflicting visions. As
460,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,the prophet who would bring to the world a great possession must go
461,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,forth into the desert to be alone until the kingdom comes to him from
462,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"within, so the poet must leave the world in order to gain the deeper"
463,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"understanding, to be face to face with God. The mood of _Das"
464,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Stunden-Buch_ is this mood of being face to face with God; it elevates
465,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"these poems to prayer, profound prayer of doubt and despair, exalted"
466,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,prayer of reconciliation and triumph.
467,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
468,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,_The Book of Hours_ contains three parts written at different periods in
469,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,the poet's life: _The Book of a Monk's Life_ (1899); _The Book of
470,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Pilgrimage_ (1901), and _The Book of Poverty and Death_ (1903), although"
471,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,the entire volume was not published until several years later. _The Book
472,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"of Hours_ glows with a mystic fervour to know God, to be near him. In"
473,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"this desire to approach the Nameless One, the young Brother in _The Book"
474,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"of a Monk's Life_ builds up about God parables, images and legends"
475,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"reminiscent of those of the 17th century Angelus Silesius, but sustained"
476,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,by a more pregnant language because exalted by a more ardent visionary
477,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,force. The motif of _The Monk's Life_ is expressed in the poem beginning
478,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,with the lines:
479,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
480,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"""I live my life in circles that grow wide"
481,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"And endlessly unroll."""

483,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Through the grey cell of the young Monk there flash in luminous
484,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"magnificence the colours of the great renaissance masters, for he feels"
485,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"in Titian, in Michelangelo, in Raphael the same fervour that animates"
486,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"him; they, too, are worshippers of the same God."
487,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
488,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,There are poems in _The Book of Pilgrimage_ of the stillness of a
489,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,whispered prayer in a great Cathedral and there are others that carry in
490,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,their exultation the music of mighty hymns. The visions in this second
491,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,book are no less ecstatic though less glowingly colourful; they have
492,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,withdrawn inward and have brought a great peace and a great faith as in
493,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"the poem of God, whose very manifestation is the quietude and hush of a"
494,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,silent world:
495,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
496,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"""By day Thou art the Legend and the Dream"
497,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"That like a whisper floats about all men,"

499,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"After the hour has struck, to close again."
500,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,And when the day with drowsy gesture bends
501,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"And sinks to sleep beneath the evening skies,"
502,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,As from each roof a tower of smoke ascends

505,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"The last part of _The Book of Hours_, _The Book of Poverty and Death_,"
506,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,is finally a symphony of variations on the two great symbolic themes in
507,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,the work of Rilke. As Christ in the parable of the rich young man
508,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"demands the abandonment of all treasures, so in this book the poet sees"
509,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"the coming of the Kingdom, the fulfilment of all our longings for a"
510,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,nearness to God when we have become simple again like little children
511,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,and poor in possessions like God Himself. In this phase of Rilke's
512,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"development, the principle of renunciation constitutes a certain"
513,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,negative element in his philosophy. The poet later proceeded to a
514,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"positive acquiescence toward man's possessions, at least those acquired"
515,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,or created in the domain of art.
516,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
517,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,In our approach through the mystic we touch reality most deeply. It is
518,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,because of this that all art and all philosophy culminate in their final
519,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,forms in a crystallization of those values of life that remain forever
520,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"inexplicable to pure reason; they become religious in the simple,"
521,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,profound sense of that word. Before the eternal facts of Life doubt and
522,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"strife are reconciled into faith, will and pride change into humility."
523,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,The realization of this truth expressed in the medium of poetry is the
524,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,significance of Rilke's _Book of Hours_. A distinguished Scandinavian
525,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,writer has pronounced _Das Stunden-Buch_ one of the supreme literary
526,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,achievements of our time and its deepest and most beautiful book of
527,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,prayer.
528,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
529,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,In his subsequent poetic work Rilke did not again reach the sustained
530,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"high quality of this book, the mood and idea of which he incorporated"
531,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,into a prose work of exquisite lyrical beauty: _The Sketch of Malte

539,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,the means of expressing symbolically an abstract thought or a great
540,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,human destiny. _Abishag_ presents the contrast between the dawning and
541,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,the fading life; _David Singing Before Saul_ shows the impatience of
542,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"awakening ambition, and _Joshua_ is the man who forces even God to do"

550,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"_Saint Sebastian_ personifying martyrdom, and _The Rose Window_, whose"
551,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,glowing magic is compared to the hypnotic power of the tiger's eye.

558,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Almost all of the poems in these two volumes are short and precise. The
559,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,images are portrayed with the sensitive intensity of impressionistic

562,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"and the pictures are painted in nervous, darting strokes as though to"
563,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"convey the manner in which they were perceived: in one single,"
564,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,all-absorbing glance. For this reason many of these _New Poems_ are not
565,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"quite free from a certain element of virtuosity. On the other hand,"

568,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"vision like a circling element of fire, flaming and blinding in the"

576,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Rilke travelled extensively, prior to the writing of these volumes, in"
577,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"Italy, Germany, France, and Scandinavia. His book on the five painters"

587,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"his creations, like a great sun over the most fruitful years of his"
588,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"life, stands the towering personality of Auguste Rodin. The _New Poems_"
589,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"bear the dedication: ""A mon grand ami, Auguste Rodin,"" indicating the"
590,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"twofold influence which the French sculptor wielded over the poet, that"
591,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,of a friend and that of an artist.
592,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
593,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"One recalls the broad, solidly-built figure of Rodin with his rugged"
594,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"features and high, finely chiselled forehead, moving slowly among the"
595,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,white glistening marble busts and statues as a giant in an old legend
596,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"moves among the rocks and mountains of his realm, patient, all-enduring,"
597,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"the man who has mastered life, strong and tempered by the storms of"
598,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"time. And one thinks of Rainer Maria Rilke, young, blond, with his"
599,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"slender aristocratic figure, the slightly bent-forward figure of one who"
600,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"on solitary walks meditates much and intensely, with his sensitive full"
601,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"mouth and the ""firm structure of the eyebrow gladly sunk in the shadow"
602,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"of contemplation,"" the face full of dreams and with an expression of"
603,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,listening to some distant music.
604,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
605,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"From no other book of his, not excepting _The Book of Hours_, can we"
606,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,deduce so accurate a conception of Rilke's philosophy of Life and Art as
607,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,we can draw from his comparatively short monograph on Auguste Rodin.
608,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
609,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Rilke sees in Rodin the dominant personification in our age of the
610,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"""power of servitude in all nature."" For this reason the book on Rodin is"
611,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,far more than a purely æsthetic valuation of the sculptor's work; Rilke
612,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,traces throughout the book the strongly ethical principle which works
613,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,itself out in every creative act in the realm of art. This grasp of the
614,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,deeper significance of all art gives to the book on Rodin its well-nigh
615,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,religious aspect of thought and its hymnlike rhythm of expression. He
616,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"begins: ""Rodin was solitary before fame came to him, and afterward he"
617,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,became perhaps still more solitary. For fame is ultimately but the
618,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"summary of all misunderstandings that crystallize about a new name."" And"
619,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"he sums up this one man's greatness: ""Sometime it will be realized what"
620,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,has made this great artist so supreme. He was a worker whose only desire
621,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,was to penetrate with all his forces into the humble and the difficult
622,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,significance of his tool. Therein lay a certain renunciation of life but
623,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,in just this renunciation lay his triumph--for Life entered into his
624,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,"work."""
625,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,
626,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,Rodin became to Rilke the manifestation of the divine principle of the
627,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,creative impulse in man. Thus Rilke's monograph on Auguste Rodin will
628,THE POETRY OF RAINER MARIA RILKE,remain the poet's testament on Life and Art.

1133,REMEMBRANCE,"In the dusk of the shelves, embossed"

1138,REMEMBRANCE,
1139,REMEMBRANCE,And it comes to you then at last--

1160,MUSIC,Let your flute be still and your soul float through

1205,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,
1206,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,
1207,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,The white veiled maids to confirmation go
1208,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,Through deep green garden paths they slowly wind;
1209,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,Their childhood they are leaving now behind:
1210,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,"The future will be different, they know."
1211,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,
1212,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,Oh! Will it come? They wait--It must come soon!
1213,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,"The next long hour slowly strikes at last,"
1214,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,"The whole house stirs again, the feast is past,"
1215,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,And sadly passes by the afternoon ...
1216,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,
1217,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,Like resurrection were the garments white
1218,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,The wreathed procession walked through trees arched wide
1219,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,"Into the church, as cool as silk inside,"
1220,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,With long aisles of tall candles flaming bright:
1221,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,The lights all shone like jewels rich and rare
1222,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,To solemn eyes that watched them gleam and flare.
1223,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,
1224,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,Then through the silence the great song rose high
1225,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,"Up to the vaulted dome like clouds it soared,"

1227,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,Over white veils like rain it seemed to die.
1228,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,

1232,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,"And flowers and stars and fluting notes of bird,"
1233,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,"And dim, quaint figures shimmering like gold"
1234,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,Seemed to come forth from distant myths of old.
1235,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,

1239,MAIDENS AT CONFIRMATION,"Beyond the city, gardens hidden from view"

1565,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1566,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1567,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1568,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1569,THE BOOK OF HOURS,I live my life in circles that grow wide
1570,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"And endlessly unroll,"
1571,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"I may not reach the last, but on I glide"
1572,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Strong pinioned toward my goal.
1573,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1574,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"About the old tower, dark against the sky,"
1575,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"The beat of my wings hums,"
1576,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"I circle about God, sweep far and high"
1577,THE BOOK OF HOURS,On through milleniums.
1578,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1579,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Am I a bird that skims the clouds along,"
1580,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Or am I a wild storm, or a great song?"
1581,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1582,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1583,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1584,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1585,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Many have painted her. But there was one
1586,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Who drew his radiant colours from the sun.
1587,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Mysteriously glowing through a background dim
1588,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"When he was suffering she came to him,"
1589,THE BOOK OF HOURS,And all the heavy pain within his heart
1590,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Rose in his hands and stole into his art.
1591,THE BOOK OF HOURS,His canvas is the beautiful bright veil
1592,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Through which her sorrow shines. There where the
1593,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Texture o'er her sad lips is closely drawn
1594,THE BOOK OF HOURS,A trembling smile softly begins to dawn ...
1595,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Though angels with seven candles light the place
1596,THE BOOK OF HOURS,You cannot read the secret of her face.
1597,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1598,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1599,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1600,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1601,THE BOOK OF HOURS,In cassocks clad I have had many brothers
1602,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"In southern cloisters where the laurel grows,"
1603,THE BOOK OF HOURS,They paint Madonnas like fair human mothers
1604,THE BOOK OF HOURS,And I dream of young Titians and of others
1605,THE BOOK OF HOURS,In which the God with shining radiance glows.
1606,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1607,THE BOOK OF HOURS,But though my vigil constantly I keep
1608,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"My God is dark--like woven texture flowing,"
1609,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"A hundred drinking roots, all intertwined;"
1610,THE BOOK OF HOURS,I only know that from His warmth I'm growing.
1611,THE BOOK OF HOURS,More I know not: my roots lie hidden deep
1612,THE BOOK OF HOURS,My branches only are swayed by the wind.
1613,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1614,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1615,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1616,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1617,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Thou Anxious One! And dost thou then not hear
1618,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Against thee all my surging senses sing?
1619,THE BOOK OF HOURS,About thy face in circles drawing near
1620,THE BOOK OF HOURS,My thought floats like a fluttering white wing.
1621,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1622,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Dost thou not see, before thee stands my soul"
1623,THE BOOK OF HOURS,In silence wrapt my Springtime's prayer to pray?
1624,THE BOOK OF HOURS,But when thy glance rests on me then my whole
1625,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Being quickens and blooms like trees in May.
1626,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1627,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"When thou art dreaming then I am thy Dream,"
1628,THE BOOK OF HOURS,But when thou art awake I am thy Will
1629,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Potent with splendour, radiant and sublime,"
1630,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Expanding like far space star-lit and still
1631,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Into the distant mystic realm of Time.
1632,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1633,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1634,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1635,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1636,THE BOOK OF HOURS,I love my life's dark hours
1637,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"In which my senses quicken and grow deep,"
1638,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"While, as from faint incense of faded flowers"
1639,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Or letters old, I magically steep"
1640,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Myself in days gone by: again I give
1641,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Myself unto the past:--again I live.
1642,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1643,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Out of my dark hours wisdom dawns apace,"
1644,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Infinite Life unrolls its boundless space ...
1645,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1646,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Then I am shaken as a sweeping storm
1647,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Shakes a ripe tree that grows above a grave
1648,THE BOOK OF HOURS,'Round whose cold clay the roots twine fast and warm--
1649,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"And Youth's fair visions that glowed bright and brave,"
1650,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Dreams that were closely cherished and for long,"
1651,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Are lost once more in sadness and in song.

1659,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1660,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1661,THE BOOK OF HOURS,By day Thou are the Legend and the Dream
1662,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"That like a whisper floats about all men,"
1663,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"The deep and brooding stillnesses which seem,"
1664,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"After the hour has struck, to close again."
1665,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1666,THE BOOK OF HOURS,And when the day with drowsy gesture bends
1667,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"And sinks to sleep beneath the evening skies,"
1668,THE BOOK OF HOURS,As from each roof a tower of smoke ascends--
1669,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"So does Thy Realm, my God, around me rise."
1670,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1671,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1672,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1673,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1674,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"All those who seek Thee tempt Thee,"
1675,THE BOOK OF HOURS,And those who find would bind Thee
1676,THE BOOK OF HOURS,To gesture and to form.
1677,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1678,THE BOOK OF HOURS,But I would comprehend Thee
1679,THE BOOK OF HOURS,As the wide Earth unfolds Thee.
1680,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Thou growest with my maturity,"
1681,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Thou Art in calm and storm.
1682,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1683,THE BOOK OF HOURS,I ask of Thee no vanity
1684,THE BOOK OF HOURS,To evidence and prove Thee.
1685,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Thou Wert in eons old.
1686,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1687,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Perform no miracles for me,"
1688,THE BOOK OF HOURS,But justify Thy laws to me
1689,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Which, as the years pass by me."
1690,THE BOOK OF HOURS,All soundlessly unfold.

1695,THE BOOK OF HOURS,In a house was one who arose from the feast
1696,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"And went forth to wander in distant lands,"
1697,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Because there was somewhere far off in the East
1698,THE BOOK OF HOURS,A spot which he sought where a great Church stands.
1699,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"And ever his children, when breaking their bread,"
1700,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Thought of him and rose up and blessed him as dead.
1701,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1702,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"In another house was the one who had died,"
1703,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Who still sat at table and drank from the glass
1704,THE BOOK OF HOURS,And ever within the walls did abide--
1705,THE BOOK OF HOURS,For out of the house he could no more pass.
1706,THE BOOK OF HOURS,And his children set forth to seek for the spot
1707,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Where stands the great Church which he forgot.

1713,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Close my ears, I can hear your footsteps fall,"
1714,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"And without feet I still can follow you,"
1715,THE BOOK OF HOURS,And without voice I still can to you call.
1716,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Break off my arms, and I can embrace you,"
1717,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Enfold you with my heart as with a hand.
1718,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Hold my heart, my brain will take fire of you"
1719,THE BOOK OF HOURS,As flax ignites from a lit fire-brand--
1720,THE BOOK OF HOURS,And flame will sweep in a swift rushing flood
1721,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Through all the singing currents of my blood.
1722,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1723,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1724,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1725,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1726,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"In the deep nights I dig for you, O Treasure!"
1727,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"To seek you over the wide world I roam,"
1728,THE BOOK OF HOURS,For all abundance is but meager measure
1729,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Of your bright beauty which is yet to come.
1730,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1731,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Over the road to you the leaves are blowing,"
1732,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Few follow it, the way is long and steep."
1733,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"You dwell in solitude--Oh, does your glowing"
1734,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Heart in some far off valley lie asleep?
1735,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1736,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"My bloody hands, with digging bruised, I've lifted,"
1737,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Spread like a tree I stretch them in the air
1738,THE BOOK OF HOURS,To find you before day to night has drifted;
1739,THE BOOK OF HOURS,I reach out into space to seek you there ...
1740,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1741,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Then, as though with a swift impatient gesture,"
1742,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Flashing from distant stars on sweeping wing,"
1743,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"You come, and over earth a magic vesture"
1744,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Steals gently as the rain falls in the spring.

1751,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1752,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1753,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1754,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Her mouth is like the mouth of a fine bust
1755,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"That cannot utter sound, nor breathe, nor kiss,"
1756,THE BOOK OF HOURS,But that had once from Life received all this
1757,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Which shaped its subtle curves, and ever must"
1758,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"From fullness of past knowledge dwell alone,"
1759,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"A thing apart, a parable in stone."

1766,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Thou art Poverty's great rose,"
1767,THE BOOK OF HOURS,The eternal metamorphose
1768,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Of gold into the light of sun.
1769,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1770,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Thou art the mystic homeless One;
1771,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Into the world Thou never came,"
1772,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Too mighty Thou, too great to name;"
1773,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Voice of the storm, Song that the wild wind sings,"
1774,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Thou Harp that shatters those who play Thy strings!
1775,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1776,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1777,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1778,THE BOOK OF HOURS,
1779,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"A watcher of Thy spaces make me,"
1780,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Make me a listener at Thy stone,"
1781,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Give to me vision and then wake me
1782,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Upon Thy oceans all alone.
1783,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Thy rivers' courses let me follow
1784,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Where they leap the crags in their flight
1785,THE BOOK OF HOURS,And where at dusk in caverns hollow
1786,THE BOOK OF HOURS,They croon to music of the night.
1787,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Send me far into Thy barren land
1788,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"Where the snow clouds the wild wind drives,"
1789,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Where monasteries like gray shrouds stand--
1790,THE BOOK OF HOURS,August symbols of unlived lives.
1791,THE BOOK OF HOURS,"There pilgrims climb slowly one by one,"
1792,THE BOOK OF HOURS,And behind them a blind man goes:
1793,THE BOOK OF HOURS,With him I will walk till day is done
1794,THE BOOK OF HOURS,Up the pathway that no one knows ...
