32,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
33,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
34,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"It was the young Swaigder,"
35,THE FORCE OF RUNES,With the little ball he played;
36,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"The ball flew into the Damsel's lap,"
37,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And pale her cheeks it made.
38,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
39,THE FORCE OF RUNES,The ball flew into the Damsel's bower.
40,THE FORCE OF RUNES,He went of it in quest;
41,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Before he out of the bower came,"
42,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Much care had filled his breast!
43,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
44,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""The ball, the ball thou shouldst not fling,"
45,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Shouldst cast it not at me;
46,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"There sits a maid in a foreign land,"
47,THE FORCE OF RUNES,She sighs and weeps for thee.
48,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
49,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Thou never more shalt peace obtain,"
50,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Or close in sleep thine eyes,"
51,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Till thou has freed the lovely maid,"
52,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"In thrall for thee that lies."""
53,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
54,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"It was the young Swaigder,"
55,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Placed his cap upon his head,"
56,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And into the high chamber
57,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Unto his knights he sped.
58,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
59,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Here, quaffing mead from out the shell"
60,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Sit ye, my Courtmen bold,"
61,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Whilst I go to the mountain drear,"
62,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Speech with the Dead to hold!
63,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
64,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Here, quaffing mead and ruddy wine,"
65,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Sit ye my men so brave,"
66,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Whilst I go to the mountain drear,"
67,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"With my mother speech to have!"""
68,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
69,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"It was the young Swaigder,"
70,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And he began to call--
71,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Riven were wall and marble stone,"
72,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And the hill began to fall.
73,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
74,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Who is it breaks my sleep,"
75,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And works me such annoy?
76,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Deep, deep below the earth so swart"
77,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Can I not peace enjoy?"""
78,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
79,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""O, it is the young Swaigder,"
80,THE FORCE OF RUNES,The son thou lovest dear;
81,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"He fain would good advice from thee,"
82,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"His darling mother, hear."
83,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
84,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""For I have now a step-mother,"
85,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"So harsh she is of mood,"
86,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And she upon me Runes has cast
87,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"For a maid I ne'er have view'd."""
88,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
89,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""I will give thee a noble horse,"
90,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Shall bear thee at thy need,"
91,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And he will run upon the sea
92,THE FORCE OF RUNES,As on the verdant mead.
93,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
94,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""And I will to thee a napkin give,"
95,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"'Tis of Ager wool entire,"
96,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Before thee on the board shall stand,"
97,THE FORCE OF RUNES,What meat thou shalt desire.
98,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
99,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""I will to thee a deer's horn give,"
100,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Mark well its golden gleam;
101,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"All the drink thou wishest for,"
102,THE FORCE OF RUNES,From the golden horn shall stream.
103,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
104,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""And I will give to thee a sword,"
105,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Hardened in Dragon's blood;
106,THE FORCE OF RUNES,It will glitter like a beam
107,THE FORCE OF RUNES,When thou ridest through the wood.
108,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
109,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""I will give to thee a barque,"
110,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Its white sails silk shall be;
111,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Shall move as well on the verdant earth
112,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"As on the foaming sea."""
113,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
114,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Their silken sails on the gilded yard
115,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"So wide, so wide they spread;"
116,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Away they sailed to the distant land,"
117,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Where dwelt the lovely maid.
118,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
119,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And they have cast their anchors
120,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Upon the yellow sand;
121,THE FORCE OF RUNES,It was the young Swaigder
122,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Who stepped the first to land.
123,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
124,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"It was the young Swaigder,"
125,THE FORCE OF RUNES,His ship to the shore he steers;
126,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"And the first man there that met him,"
127,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Was a man of many years.
128,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
129,THE FORCE OF RUNES,It was then the ancient man
130,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Was the first to make enquire:
131,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""O, what is the name of the young swain"
132,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"With the sword, and the look of fire?"""
133,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
134,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""O, he is hight young Swaigder,"
135,THE FORCE OF RUNES,So wide his fame doth fly;
136,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And he for a maid is pining sore
137,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"On whom he ne'er set eye."""
138,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
139,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""There is within this land a maid,"
140,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Who pining long hath been
141,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"For a swain that hight is Swaigder,"
142,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"And him she ne'er has seen."""
143,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
144,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""If longs she after a young swain"
145,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"On whom she ne'er set eye,"
146,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"And he is hight young Swaigder,"
147,THE FORCE OF RUNES,He is here in verity.
148,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
149,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Now do thou hear, thou ancient man,"
150,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"If it as thou sayest be,"
151,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Become I King upon this land,"
152,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"I'll make a Count of thee."""
153,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
154,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""'Midst of yonder verdant wood"
155,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Stands the castle of the maid;
156,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"The house is of gray marble stone,"
157,THE FORCE OF RUNES,The court with steel belaid.
158,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
159,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""The house is of grey marble stone"
160,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"The court with steel is floored,"
161,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"The portal is of ruddy gold,"
162,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Twelve bears before it guard.
163,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
164,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""In middle of the maiden's court"
165,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"A linden spreads its shade,"
166,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"If truly thou art Swaigder,"
167,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Hie forward unafraid."""
168,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
169,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Away then rode young Swaigder,"
170,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Cast towards the gate his eye;
171,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"And all the locks that before it hung,"
172,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Down fell they instantly.
173,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
174,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Then withered the leaf, then withered the linden,"
175,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And the grass at the linden's root;
176,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And the twelve bears who the portal guard
177,THE FORCE OF RUNES,They fell at the hero's foot.
178,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
179,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"When he came into the castle-court,"
180,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"He smoothed his array,"
181,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Then proudly up to the high, high hall"
182,THE FORCE OF RUNES,To the King he took his way.
183,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
184,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Hail to thee, hail to thee, heathen King,"
185,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Who dost at the wide board sit,"
186,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Wilt thou give me thy daughter fair?
187,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Return me an answer fit."""
188,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
189,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""I have no daughter, I have no daughter,"
190,THE FORCE OF RUNES,No daughter but one have I;
191,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And she so sorely longing
192,THE FORCE OF RUNES,For a young swain doth lie.
193,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
194,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""For a young swain whom she has never seen"
195,THE FORCE OF RUNES,My daughter longing lies;
196,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"The swain he hight is Swaigder,"
197,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"So far his fame it hies."""
198,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
199,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"In went the little serving boy,"
200,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Wore a kirtle white to see:
201,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""If thou dost long for Swaigder,"
202,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Know that hither come is he."""
203,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
204,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"In then came the lovely maid,"
205,THE FORCE OF RUNES,In white silk clad was she:
206,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Now welcome, welcome my dearest heart,"
207,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Young Swaigder, welcome be!"""
208,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
209,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Wilt thou consent baptized to be,"
210,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"And the Christian faith receive,"
211,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And follow me to Denmark
212,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"With young Swaigder to live?"""
213,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
214,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Willingly I baptized will be,"
215,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Will the Christian faith receive;
216,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"And will follow thee to Denmark,"
217,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Young Swaigder, with thee to live."""
218,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
219,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"On a Thursday she baptized was,"
220,THE FORCE OF RUNES,She the Christian faith received;
221,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"On a Sunday they their bridal held,"
222,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And ever in peace they lived.
223,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
224,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"They kept their bridal feast for a day,"
225,THE FORCE OF RUNES,They kept the same for nine;
226,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"And there sat waiting the ancient man,"
227,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And through all of them did pine.
228,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
229,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Be thanks to brave young Swaigder,"
230,THE FORCE OF RUNES,He kept so well his word;
231,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"A Knight he made of that ancient man,"
232,THE FORCE OF RUNES,Set him highest at the board.
233,THE FORCE OF RUNES,
234,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Now joyful is young Swaigder,"
235,THE FORCE OF RUNES,His trouble all has fled;
236,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"He King became upon that land,"
237,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"She Queen, when her sire was dead."

243,THE HAIL STORM {14},
244,THE HAIL STORM {14},
245,THE HAIL STORM {14},As in Horunga haven
246,THE HAIL STORM {14},"We fed the crow and raven,"
247,THE HAIL STORM {14},I heard the tempest breaking
248,THE HAIL STORM {14},Of demon Thorgerd's waking;
249,THE HAIL STORM {14},"Sent by the fiend in anger,"
250,THE HAIL STORM {14},With din and stunning clangor;
251,THE HAIL STORM {14},"To crush our might intended,"
252,THE HAIL STORM {14},Gigantic hail descended.
253,THE HAIL STORM {14},
254,THE HAIL STORM {14},A pound the smallest pebble
255,THE HAIL STORM {14},"Did weigh, and others treble;"
256,THE HAIL STORM {14},"It drifted, dealing slaughter,"
257,THE HAIL STORM {14},"And blood ran out like water,"
258,THE HAIL STORM {14},"Ran recking, red and horrid,"
259,THE HAIL STORM {14},From battered cheek and forehead;
260,THE HAIL STORM {14},"But, though so rudely greeted,"
261,THE HAIL STORM {14},No Jornsberg man retreated.
262,THE HAIL STORM {14},
263,THE HAIL STORM {14},"With anger ever sharper,"
264,THE HAIL STORM {14},"Thorgerda fierce, and Yrpr,"
265,THE HAIL STORM {14},"Shot lightning from each finger,"
266,THE HAIL STORM {14},Which sped and did not linger.
267,THE HAIL STORM {14},Then sank our brave in numbers
268,THE HAIL STORM {14},"To cold, eternal slumbers;"
269,THE HAIL STORM {14},"There lay the good and gallant,"
270,THE HAIL STORM {14},Renowned for warlike talent.
271,THE HAIL STORM {14},
272,THE HAIL STORM {14},To bide the storm unable
273,THE HAIL STORM {14},"Our chieftain hewed his cable,"
274,THE HAIL STORM {14},And with his ship departed--
275,THE HAIL STORM {14},"We follow, broken-hearted;"
276,THE HAIL STORM {14},For in Horunga haven
277,THE HAIL STORM {14},Our bravest feed the raven;
278,THE HAIL STORM {14},"We did our best, but no men"
279,THE HAIL STORM {14},Can stand 'gainst hail and foemen.

285,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
286,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
287,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"In Denmark once a lady dwelt,"
288,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},Hellelil the name she bore;
289,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"A castle new that lady built,"
290,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},It shone all Denmark o'er.
291,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
292,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Her daughter dear was stolen away,"
293,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},She sought for her far and near;
294,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"The more she sought the less she found,"
295,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},To her great distress and care.
296,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
297,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"She bid a noble ship be built,"
298,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},Therein gilt masts did stand;
299,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},With valiant knights and courtmen bold
300,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},She caused it to be manned.
301,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
302,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Her sons she followed to the strand,"
303,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},With many a fond caress;
304,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"For eight long years they sailed away,"
305,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},Enduring much distress.
306,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
307,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"For eight years had they sailed away,"
308,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"So long they thought the tide,"
309,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"When they sailed before a lofty hill,"
310,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},And straight to land they hied.
311,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
312,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},Then peeped the Damsel Swanelil
313,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},Forth from the mountain brow:
314,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""O whence can be these stranger swains,"
315,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"As guests that seek us now?"""
316,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
317,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"The youngest brother then replied,"
318,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},So ready of speech was he:
319,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""A widow's three poor sons we are,"
320,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},So long we've sailed the sea.
321,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
322,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""Dame Hellelil our mother is,"
323,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},We were born on Denmark's ground;
324,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"From us our sister stolen was,"
325,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"And her we have yet not found."""
326,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
327,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""If thou wert born on Danish ground,"
328,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},And Dame Hellelil be thy mother
329,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},Then I thy beloved sister am
330,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},And thou art my youngest brother.
331,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
332,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""Now do thou hear, my youngest brother,"
333,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},Why didst not at home remain?
334,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},If thou hadst a thousand thousand lives
335,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Thou none of them couldst retain."""
336,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
337,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},She placed him in the smallest nook
338,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},She could in the house espy:
339,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"She bade him for sake of the highest God,"
340,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},Neither to laugh nor cry.
341,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
342,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Rosmer came from the ocean home,"
343,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},And straight he fell to bann:
344,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""O I can smell by my right hand"
345,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"That here is a Christian man."""
346,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
347,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""A Bird with a dead man's shank in its mouth,"
348,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},Chanced over our house to fly;
349,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"He cast it in, I cast it out,"
350,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"And that full speedily."""
351,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
352,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"A noble meal she then prepared,"
353,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},And she gave him many a kiss:
354,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""O here is come my sister's son,"
355,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},It would grieve me him to miss.
356,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
357,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""My sister's son is here arrived"
358,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},From the land where I first drew breath;
359,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Now give him, my lord, thy firm, firm oath,"
360,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Thou'lt do unto him no scathe."""
361,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
362,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""If here has come thy sister's son"
363,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"From the native land of both,"
364,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"To do him ne'er any kind of hurt,"
365,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"I swear by my highest oath."""
366,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
367,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},It was the lofty Rosmer King
368,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},To two serving swains did call:
369,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""Bid ye proud Swanelil's sister's son"
370,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Attend me in the hall."""
371,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
372,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"It was Swanelil's sister's son,"
373,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},Before Rosmer should appear;
374,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"His heart it fluttered, his body it shivered,"
375,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},He stood in such mighty fear.
376,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
377,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Then took Rosmer her sister's son,"
378,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},Placed him upon his knee;
379,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},He stroked him so tenderly on the face
380,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},That 'twas yellow and blue to see.
381,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
382,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},Then answered proud Dame Swanelil:
383,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""Thou forget'st, Sir Rosmer, mayhap,"
384,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},Thou hast not fingers small enough
385,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"To stroke so little a chap."""
386,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
387,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"And he was there till the years were five,"
388,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},Then he longed for his native land:
389,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""Now cause, O sister Swanelil,"
390,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"That I'm set on the yellow strand."""
391,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
392,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},It was proud Dame Swanelil
393,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},'Fore Rosmer goes to stand;
394,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""The swain so long has been by the sea,"
395,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"That he sighs for his native land."""
396,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
397,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""If the swain has been so long by the sea"
398,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"That he sighs for his native land,"
399,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"I will give him a chest of gold,"
400,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"To be subject to his hand."""
401,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
402,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""Wilt thou give him a chest of gold,"
403,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},To be subject to his hand?

405,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Take him to his native land."""
406,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
407,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"It was proud Dame Swanelil,"
408,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},So cunning a trick she played;
409,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"She took thereout the ruddy gold all,"
410,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},And herself in the chest she laid.
411,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},
