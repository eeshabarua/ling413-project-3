40,,Soma had wened for to haue made an ende Of my bokes / before he hadde begynnynge But all vayne they dyde so comprehende Whan they of them lacke vnderstandynge Vaynfull was & is theyr mysse contryuynge Who lyst the trouthe of them for to enfuse For the reed and whyte they wryte full true 
41,,Well sayd this lady I haue perceueraunce Of our bokes / whiche that ye endyte So as ye saye is all the cyrcumstaunce Vnto the hyghe pleasure of the reed and the whyte Which hath your trouth / and wyll you acquyte Doubte ye no thynge / but at the last ye maye Of your true mynde yet fynde a Ioyfull daye 
42,,Forsothe I sayd / dysdayne and straungenesse I fere them sore / and fals reporte I wolde they were / in warde all doutles Lyke as I was / without conforte Than wolde I thynke / my lady wolde resorte Vnto dame mercy / my payne to consyder God knoweth all / I wolde we were togyder 
43,,Though in meane season / of grene grasse I fede It wolde not greue me / yf she knewe my heuynesse My trauayle is grete / I praye god be my spede To resyste the myght / of myn enmyes subtylnesse Whiche awayte to take / me by theyr doublenesse My wysdome is lytel / yet god may graunt me grace Them to defende / in euery maner of cace

45,,And now she sayd come on your waye with me Unto a goodly toure whiche is solacyous Beholde it yonder / full of felycyte Quadrant it was / me thought full meruaylous With golden turrettes / gaye and gloryous Gargayled with greyho[un]des / and with many lyons Made of fyne golde / with dyuers sondry dragons 
46,,The wyndowes byrall / without resplendysshaunt The fayre yuery / coloured with grene And all aboute there was dependaunt Grete gargeyles of golde / full meruaylously besene Neuer was made / a fayrer place I wene The ryght excellent lady toke her intresse Ryght so dyde I / by meruaylous swetnesse 
47,,Whan we came in / I dyde aboute beholde The goodly temple / with pynacles vp sette Wherin were ymages / of kynges all of golde With dyuers scryptures / without ony lette Aloft the roofe / were emeraudes full grette Set in fyne golde / with amyable rudyes Endented with dyamondes / and mayn turkyes 
48,,The wyndowes hystoried / with many noble kynges The pyllers Iasper / dyuersed with asure By pendaunt penacles / of many noble rynges The pauement calcedony / beynge fayre and sure The aras golde / with the story pure Of the syche of thebes / with actes auenturous Of ryght noble knyghtes / hardy and chyualrous

50,,Whan she was gone / the temple all alonge I went my selfe / with syghtes grete and feruent Alas I sayd / with inwarde paynes stronge My herte doth blede / now all to torne and rent For lacke of conforte / my herte is almost spent O meruelo[us] fortune / which hast [in] loue me brought Where is my conforte / that I so longe haue sought 
51,,O wonderfull loue / whiche fell vnto my lotte O loue ryght clene / without ony thought vntrue Syth thy fyrst louynge / not blemyssed with spotte But euermore / the falseshede to extue O dolorous payne / whiche doste renue O pyteous herte / where is the helthe and boote Of thy lady / that perst the at the roote 
52,,What thynge is loue / that causeth suche turment From whens cometh it / me thynke it is good questy[on] Yf it be nature / from nature it is sent Loue maye come of kynde by true affeccyon Loue may appetyte / by naturall eleccyon Than must loue nedes be / I perceyue it in mynde A thynge fyrst gyuen / by the god of kynde 
53,,Alas o nature / why mayst not thou truely Cause my lady loue / as thou hast me constrayned Hath she power to domyne the vtterly Why mayst not thou / cause her {be} somwhat payned With natures moeuynge / for lou{e is} not fayned Alas for sorowe / why madest th{ou h}er so fayre Without to loue / that she lyst soone repayre 
54,,Two thynges me conforte / euer in pryncypall The fyrst be bokes / made in antyquyte By Gower and Chauncers / poetes rethorycall And Lydgate eke / by good auctoryte Makynge mencyon / of the felycyte Of my lady and me / by dame fortunes chaunce To mete togyders / by wonderfull ordynaunce 
55,,The seconde is / where fortune dooth me brynge In many placys / I se by prophecy As in the storyes / of the olde buyldynge Letters for my lady / depeynted wonderly And letters for me / besyde her meruayllously Agreynge well / vnto my bokes all In dyuers placys / I se it in generall 
56,,O loue moost dere / o loue nere to my harte O gentyll floure / I wolde you knewe my wo Now that your beaute / perst me with the darte With your vertue / and your mekenes also Sythens ye so dyde / it is ryght longe ago My herte doth se you / it is for you bebledde Myne eyen with teeres / ben often made full redde 
57,,Where are ye now / the floure of Ioye and grace Whiche myght me conforte / in this inwarde sorowe Myne excellent lady / it is a ryght pyteous case Good be my guyde / and saynt George vnto borowe O clere Aurora / the sterre of the morowe Whiche many yeres / with thy bemes mery Hath me awaked / to se thyne emyspery 
58,,{Th}us as I mourned / I sawe than apper{e} Thre goodly myrours dependaunt on the wall Set in fyne golde bordred with stones clere The glasses pure / they were of crystall Made longe ago to be memoryall And vnder the fyrst glasse ryght fayre wryten was Beholde thy selfe / and thy fautes or thou passe 
59,,By a sylken threde / small as ony heere Ouer I sawe hange / a swerde full ponderous Without a scauberde / full sharpe for to fere The poynt dounwarde / ryght harde and asperous All this I sawe / with hert full dolorous Yet at auenture / to se the mystery In the myroure / I loked than full sodenly 
60,,In this glasse I sawe / how I had ledde my lyfe Sythens the tyme of my dyscrecyon As vnto wyldnesse / alwaye affyrmatyfe Folowynge the pleasure / of wylfull amonycyon Not vnto vertue hauynge intencyon Ihesu sayd I / thou hast me well preserued From this swerdes fall / whiche I haue oft deserued 
61,,O ye estates / aloft on fortunes whele Remembre this swerde / whiche ouer you dependeth Beware the fall / before that ye it fele Se your one euyll / se what vengeaunce ensueth Correcte none other / whan that your fautes renueth Calke not not goddes power / bryef not [the] tens future Beholde this glasse / se how he may endure 
62,,Many one {weneth / the future t}ens to {brefe} By calculacyon goddes power to withstande Bathynge theyr swerdes / in blode by myschefe Tyll at the last as I do vnderstande This swerde doth fal by the myght of goddes hande Vpon then all / whiche wolde his power abate Then they repent but than it is to late 
63,,This goodly myrour / I ryght well behelde Remembrynge well / my dedes done in tymes past I toke forwytte / than for to be my shelde By grace well armed / not to be agast Thus as I stode / I dyde se at the last The seconde myrour / as bryght as phebus Set rounde about / with stones precyous 
64,,Ouer whiche dyde h[an]ge / a floure of golde ryght fyne Wherin was set / an emeraude full bryght Ryght large and grete / whiche w[on]derfull dyde shyne That me thought it was / grete conforte to my syght Bordred with dyamondes / cast[yn]ge a meruaylo[us] lyght This floure dyde hange / by a ryght subtyll gynne With a chayne of yron / and many a pryue pynne 
65,,Besyde whiche there was / a table of golde With a goodly scrypture / enameled of grene The sentence wherof / I dyde well beholde The whiche sayd thus / it is openly sene That many a one / full pryuely dooth wene To blynde an other / by crafte and subtylnes That ofte blyndeth hym / for all his doublenes 
66,,In this myrour whiche is here besyde Thou shalt well lerne / they selfe for to knowe Passe forth no ferder / but loke and abyde Se what shall come / lest that thou ouer throwe A sodayne rysynge dooth oft fall alowe Without the grounde / be ryghe sure and perfyte Beholde well this glasse / & take thy respyte 
67,,Whan thou hast so done / to this floure resorte Laboure to gete it / from this harde yren chayne Unto the gynnes / vnto thy grete conforte Yf that thou canst / and take it for thy payne To be they helpe / in thy Iournaye certayne Lo here the vertues vnder wryten be Of this ryall floure in euery degre 
68,,This ryche emeraude / who so dooth it bere From his fyrst werynge / his syght shal not mynysshe Payne of the heed he nedeth not to fere By dynt of swerde / he shall neuer perysshe Ne no thynge begyn / but he shall well fynysshe Yf it be ryghtfull aftyr a true entent Without resystence of grete impedyment 
69,,Of all nygromancy / and fals enchauntement Agaynst hym wrought / he shall knowe the effecte They can not blynde hym by cursed sentement But he theyr werkes may ryght soone abiecte No maner poyson he nedeth to susspecte Neyther in mete not yet in ale ne wyne Yf it beset well besyde a serpentyne 
70,,Yf he vntrue be vnto his gentyll lady It wyll breke asondre / or crase than doubtlesse It kepeth close / neuet the auoutry This gentyll emeraude / this stone of rychesse Hath many mo vertues / whiche I do not expresse As saynt Iohan euangelyst doeth shewe openly Who of his makynge lyst se the lapydary 
71,,When I had aduerted / in my remembraunce All the maters / vnto the glasse I wente Beholdynge it / by a longe cyrcumstaunce Where as I dyde perceyue well verament How preuy malyce / his messengers had sent With subtyll engynes / to lye in a wayte Yf that they coude take me with a bayte 
72,,I sawe there trappes / I sawe theyr gynnes all I thanked god than / the swete holy goost Whiche brought me hyder so well in specyall Without whiche myrour / I had been but loost In god aboue / the lorde of myghtes moost I put my trust / for to withstande theyr euyll Whiche dayly wrought / by the myght of the deuyll 
73,,I sawe theyr maysters blacke and tydyous Made by the craft of many a nacyon For to dystroye me / with strokes peryllous To lette my Iournaye / as I make relacyon Peryllous was the waye / and the cytuacyon Full gladde was I of the vertu of this glasse Whiche shewed me / what daungers I sholde passe 
74,,O all ye estates / of the hygh renowne Beware these gynnes / beware theyr subtylte The deuyll is grete / {and re}dy to cast downe By calculacyon / of the {cur}sed cruelte Of the subtyll beestes / full of inyquyte In the olde tyme what snares were there sette By fals calkynge / to dystroye lordes grete 
75,,Than after this to the yron gynne I wente anone my wyte for to proue By lytell and lytell / to vndo euery pynne Thus in and out / I dyde the chayne ofte moue Yet coude I not come / vnto myne aboue Tyll at the last / I dyde the crafte espy Vndoynge the pynnes / & chayne full meruaylously 
76,,Full gladde was I than / whan I had this floure I kyst it oft / I behelde the coloure grene It swaged ryght well / myn inwarde doloure Myn eyes conforted / with the bryghtnes I wene This ryall floure / this emeraude to shene Whan I had goten it by my prudence Ryght gladde I was / of fortunes premynence 
77,,O fortune sayd I / thou art ryght fauorable For many a one / hath ben by symylytude To wynne this floure / full gretely tendable But they the subtylnes / myght nothynge exclude Sythnen by wysdome / I dyde this fraude conclude This floure / I sette nere my harte For perfyte loue / of my fayre ladyes darte 
78,,So this accomplysshed / than incontynent To the thyrde myrour I went dyrectly Beholdynge aboute by good auysement Seynge an ymage made full wonderly Of the holy goost with flambes ardauntly Vnder whiche I sawe with letters fayre and pure In golde well grauen this meruaylous scrypture 
79,,Frome the fader and the sone my power procedynge And of my selfe I god do ryght ofte inspyre Dyuers creatures with spyrytuall knowynge Inuysyble by dyuyne flambynge fyre The eyes I entre not it is not my desyre & am not coloured of the terrestryall grounde Nor entre the eres for I do not sounde 
80,,Nor by the nose for I am not myxte With ony maner of the ayry influence Nor by the mouthe for I am not fyxte For to be swalowed by erthly experyence Nor yet by felynge or touchynge exystence My power dyuyne can not be palpable For I myselfe am no thynge manyable 
81,,Yet vysyble I may be by good apparaunce As in the lykenesse of a doue vnto chryste Ihesu At his baptysme I dyde it with good countenaunce To shewe our godhed to be hygh and true And at his transfyguracyon our power to ensue In a fayre cloude with clere rayes radyaunt Ouer hym that I was well apparaunt 
82,,Also truely yet at the feest of pentycoste To the sones moder and the apostelles all In tonges of fyre as god of myghtes moost I dyde appere shewynge my power spyrytuall Enflambynge theyr hertes by vertues supernall Whiche after that by languages well In euery regyon coude pronounce the gospell 
83,,And where I lyst by power dyuyne I do enspyre oft causynge grete prophecy Whiche is mysconstrued whan some do enclyne Thynkynge by theyr wytte to perceyue it lyghtly Or elles calke with deuylles the trouth to sertyfy Whiche contrary be to all true saynge For deuylles be subtyll and alwaye lyenge 
84,,Whan I had aduerted with my dylygence All the scrypture I sawe me besyde H[an]ge a fayre swerde & shelde of meruailous excell[en]ce Whiche to beholde I dyde than abyde To blase the armes I dyde well prouyde The felde was syluer / and in it a medowe grene With an olyue tre full meruaylously besene 
85,,Two lyons of asure vpon euery syde Couchande were truely besyde this olyue tree A hande of stele wherin was wryten pryde Dyde holde this ryall swerde in certaynte A scrypture there was whiche sayd by subtylte Of a grete lady hondred yeres ago In the hande of stele this swerde was closed so 
86,,No maner persone / maye{s touch}e this swerde But one persone / chosen by {go}d in dede Of this ladyes kynred / n{ot} to be aferde To touche this hande / his mater for to spede And to vndo it / and take it for his mede But yf that he / be not of the lygnage The hand wyll sle hym / after olde vsage 
87,,This ryall swerde / that called is preprudence Who can it gette / it hath these vertues thre Fyrst to wynne ryght / without longe resystence Secondly encreaseth / all trouth and amyte Thyrdly of the berer through duplycyte Be pryuely fals / to the ordre of chyualry The swerdes crosse wyll crase / and shewe it openly 
88,,This shelde also / who so dooth it bere Whiche of olde tyme / was called perceueraunce Hath thre vertues / fyrst he nedeth not fere Ony grete blodeshede / by wronge incombraunce Secondly / it wolde make good apparaunce By hete vnto hym / to gyue hym warnynge To be redy / agayst his enmyes comynge 
89,,The thyrde is this / yf this calenge be ryghtfull Neuer no swerde / shall through his harneys perce Nor make hym blody / with woundes rufull For he there strength / may ryghtfully reuerce Yet moreouer / as I do well reherce This ryall shelde / in what place it be borne Shall soone be wonne / and shall not be forlorne 
90,,These thynges sene / to the thyrde myroure clere I went anone / and in it loked ryght ofte Where in my syght / dyde wonderly appere The fyrmament / with the sonne all alofte The wynde not grete / but blowynge fayre and softe And besyde the sonne / I sawe a meruaylous sterre With beames twayne / the whiche were cast aferre 
91,,The one turnynge towarde the sterre agayne The other stretched ryght towarde Phebus To beholde this sterre / I was somwhat fayne But than I mused with herte full dolorous Whyder it sygnyfyed thynges good or peryllous Thus longe I studyed / tyll at the last I thought What it sholde meane / as in my herte I sought 
92,,This sterre it sygnyfyeth the resynge of a knyght The bowynge beame agayne so tournynge Betokened rattonnes of them whiche by myght Wolde hym resyst by theyr wronge resystynge The beame towarde Phebus clerely shynynge Betokened many meruaylous fyres grete On them to lyght that wolde his purpose lete 
93,,In the fyre clerest of euery element God hath appered vnto many a one Inspyrynge them / with grete wytte refulgent Who lyst to rede many dayes agone Many one wryteth trouthe / yet c[om]forte hath he none Wherfore I fere me / lyke a swarme of bees Wylde fyre wyll lyght amonge a thousande pees
