89,GEOFFREY KEATING,O woman full of wiliness!
90,GEOFFREY KEATING,"Although for love of me you pine,"
91,GEOFFREY KEATING,"Withhold your hand adventurous,"
92,GEOFFREY KEATING,It holdeth nothing holding mine.
93,GEOFFREY KEATING,
94,GEOFFREY KEATING,"Look on my head, how it is grey!"
95,GEOFFREY KEATING,My body's weakness doth appear;
96,GEOFFREY KEATING,My blood is chill and thin; my day
97,GEOFFREY KEATING,"Is done, and there is nothing here."
98,GEOFFREY KEATING,
99,GEOFFREY KEATING,"Do not call me a foolish man,"
100,GEOFFREY KEATING,Nor lean your lovely cheek to mine
101,GEOFFREY KEATING,"O slender witch, our bodies can"
102,GEOFFREY KEATING,"Not mingle now, nor any time."
103,GEOFFREY KEATING,
104,GEOFFREY KEATING,"So take your mouth from mine, your hand"
105,GEOFFREY KEATING,"From mine, ah, take your lips away!"
106,GEOFFREY KEATING,"Lest heat to will should ripen, and"
107,GEOFFREY KEATING,All this be grave that had been gay.
108,GEOFFREY KEATING,
109,GEOFFREY KEATING,"It is this curl, a silken nest,"
110,GEOFFREY KEATING,"And this grey eye bright as the dew,"
111,GEOFFREY KEATING,"And this round, lovely, snow-white breast"
112,GEOFFREY KEATING,That draws desire in search of you.
113,GEOFFREY KEATING,
114,GEOFFREY KEATING,"I would do all for you, meseems,"
115,GEOFFREY KEATING,"But this, tho' this were happiness!"
116,GEOFFREY KEATING,"I shall not mingle in your dreams,"
117,GEOFFREY KEATING,O woman full of wiliness!

126,MARY HYNES,"Of love,"
127,MARY HYNES,"She is the love of my heart,"
128,MARY HYNES,"She is a rune,"
129,MARY HYNES,She is above
130,MARY HYNES,The women of the race of Eve
131,MARY HYNES,As the sun is above the moon.
132,MARY HYNES,
133,MARY HYNES,Lovely and airy the view from the hill
134,MARY HYNES,That looks down Ballylea;
135,MARY HYNES,But no good sight is good until
136,MARY HYNES,By great good luck you see
137,MARY HYNES,The Blossom of the Branches walking towards you

147,THE COOLUN,"Of the milk of the white goat,"
148,THE COOLUN,Or wine if it be thy will;
149,THE COOLUN,And we will talk until
150,THE COOLUN,"Talk is a trouble, too,"
151,THE COOLUN,"Out on the side of the hill,"
152,THE COOLUN,"And nothing is left to do,"
153,THE COOLUN,But an eye to look into an eye
154,THE COOLUN,"And a hand in a hand to slip,"
155,THE COOLUN,"And a sigh to answer a sigh,"
156,THE COOLUN,And a lip to find out a lip:
157,THE COOLUN,What if the night be black
158,THE COOLUN,"And the air on the mountain chill,"
159,THE COOLUN,Where the goat lies down in her track
160,THE COOLUN,And all but the fern is still!
161,THE COOLUN,"Stay with me, under my coat,"
162,THE COOLUN,And we will drink our fill
163,THE COOLUN,Of the milk of the white goat
164,THE COOLUN,Out on the side of the hill.

173,PEGGY MITCHELL,"To sweet perfection,"
174,PEGGY MITCHELL,"So grew she,"
175,PEGGY MITCHELL,As easily.
176,PEGGY MITCHELL,
177,PEGGY MITCHELL,Or as the rose that takes no care
178,PEGGY MITCHELL,Will open out on sunny air
179,PEGGY MITCHELL,"Bloom after bloom, fair after fair,"
180,PEGGY MITCHELL,Sweet after sweet;
181,PEGGY MITCHELL,"Just so did she,"
182,PEGGY MITCHELL,As carelessly.
183,PEGGY MITCHELL,
184,PEGGY MITCHELL,"She is our torment without end,"
185,PEGGY MITCHELL,"She is our enemy and friend,"
186,PEGGY MITCHELL,"Our joy, our woe;"
187,PEGGY MITCHELL,And she will send
188,PEGGY MITCHELL,Madness or glee
189,PEGGY MITCHELL,"To you and me,"

201,NANCY WALSH,Through mountains.
202,NANCY WALSH,
203,NANCY WALSH,A thousand thanks from me
204,NANCY WALSH,"To God have gone,"

215,THE RED MAN'S WIFE,And walked in the valley
216,THE RED MAN'S WIFE,In her fine clothes.
217,THE RED MAN'S WIFE,
218,THE RED MAN'S WIFE,After great fire
219,THE RED MAN'S WIFE,Great frost
220,THE RED MAN'S WIFE,Comes following.
221,THE RED MAN'S WIFE,
222,THE RED MAN'S WIFE,Turgesius was lost
223,THE RED MAN'S WIFE,By the daughter of Maelsheachlin
224,THE RED MAN'S WIFE,The King.

239,NANCY WALSH,It is not on her gown
240,NANCY WALSH,She fears to tread;
241,NANCY WALSH,It is her hair
242,NANCY WALSH,Which tumbles down
243,NANCY WALSH,And strays
244,NANCY WALSH,About her ways
245,NANCY WALSH,That she must care.
246,NANCY WALSH,
247,NANCY WALSH,And she lives nigh this place:
248,NANCY WALSH,The dead would rise
249,NANCY WALSH,If they could see her face;
250,NANCY WALSH,The dead would rise
251,NANCY WALSH,Only to hear her sing:
252,NANCY WALSH,"But death is blind, and gives not ear nor eye"
253,NANCY WALSH,To anything.
254,NANCY WALSH,
255,NANCY WALSH,We would leave behind
256,NANCY WALSH,"Both wife and child,"
257,NANCY WALSH,And house and home;
258,NANCY WALSH,"And wander blind,"
259,NANCY WALSH,"And wander thus,"
260,NANCY WALSH,"And ever roam,"
261,NANCY WALSH,If she would come to us
262,NANCY WALSH,In Erris.
263,NANCY WALSH,
264,NANCY WALSH,Softly she said to me--
265,NANCY WALSH,"Be patient till the night comes,"

276,ANTHONY O'DALY,In the waves.
277,ANTHONY O'DALY,On our meadows the dew
278,ANTHONY O'DALY,"Does not fall in the morn,"

314,WILLIAM O'KELLY,

316,WILLIAM O'KELLY,Here is thy rhyme:

319,WILLIAM O'KELLY,Thy root hath not tightened
320,WILLIAM O'KELLY,At the same time.

326,WILLIAM O'KELLY,"Brought men to hush,"
327,WILLIAM O'KELLY,Has such a tale of woe come to us
328,WILLIAM O'KELLY,In such a rush.
329,WILLIAM O'KELLY,
330,WILLIAM O'KELLY,The true flower of the blood of the place is fallen:
331,WILLIAM O'KELLY,The true clean-wheat of the Gael is reaped.
332,WILLIAM O'KELLY,
333,WILLIAM O'KELLY,"Destruction be upon Death,"

355,SEAN O'COSGAIR,"When they were weary, for they knew they were"
356,SEAN O'COSGAIR,"Safe, because you were there."
357,SEAN O'COSGAIR,

360,SEAN O'COSGAIR,"Till you were found),"
361,SEAN O'COSGAIR,"Although an hundred might be drownéd, you"

371,THE COUNTY MAYO,"And after the Feast of Brigid I shall hoist my flag and go,"
372,THE COUNTY MAYO,For since the thought got into my head I can neither stand nor sit
373,THE COUNTY MAYO,Until I find myself in the middle of the County of Mayo.
374,THE COUNTY MAYO,
375,THE COUNTY MAYO,"In Claremorris I would stop a night and sleep with decent men,"
376,THE COUNTY MAYO,"And then go on to Balla just beyond and drink galore,"
377,THE COUNTY MAYO,"And next to Kiltimagh for a visit of about a month, and then"
378,THE COUNTY MAYO,I would only be a couple of miles away from Ballymore.
379,THE COUNTY MAYO,
380,THE COUNTY MAYO,"I say and swear my heart lifts up like the lifting of a tide,"
381,THE COUNTY MAYO,"Rising up like the rising wind till fog or mist must go,"
382,THE COUNTY MAYO,"When I remember Carra and Gallen close beside,"
383,THE COUNTY MAYO,"And the Gap of the Two Bushes, and the wide plains of Mayo."
384,THE COUNTY MAYO,
385,THE COUNTY MAYO,"To Killaden then, to the place where everything grows that is best,"
386,THE COUNTY MAYO,There are raspberries there and strawberries there and all that
387,THE COUNTY MAYO,is good for men;
388,THE COUNTY MAYO,"And if I were only there in the middle of my folk my heart could rest,"
389,THE COUNTY MAYO,For age itself would leave me there and I'd be young again.

849,NOTE,
850,NOTE,This book ought to be called Loot or Plunder or Pieces of Eight or
851,NOTE,"Treasure-Trove, or some name which would indicate and get away from its"
852,NOTE,"source, for although everything in it can be referred to the Irish of"
853,NOTE,from one hundred to three hundred years ago the word translation would
854,NOTE,"be a misdescription.  There are really only two translations in it,"
855,NOTE,"Keating's ""O Woman full of Wiliness"" and Raftery's ""County Mayo.""  Some"
856,NOTE,"of the poems owe no more than a phrase, a line, half a line, to the"
857,NOTE,"Irish, and around these scraps I have blown a bubble of verse and made"
858,NOTE,"my poem.  In other cases, where the matter of the poem is almost"
859,NOTE,"entirely taken from the Irish, I have yet followed my own instinct in"
860,NOTE,"the arrangement of it, and the result might be called new poems.  My"
861,NOTE,first idea was to make an anthology of people whom long ago our poets
862,NOTE,"had praised, so that, in another language and another time, these"
863,NOTE,"honoured names might be heard again, even though in my own terms and"
864,NOTE,"not in the historic context.  I did not pursue this course, for I could"
865,NOTE,not control the material which came to me and which took no heed of my
866,NOTE,plan and was just as interesting.  It would therefore be a mistake to
867,NOTE,consider that these verses are representative of the poets by whom they
868,NOTE,are inspired.  In the case of David O'Bruadair this is less true than
869,NOTE,"in any of the others, but, even in his case, although I have often"
870,NOTE,"conveyed his matter almost verbatim, the selection is not"
871,NOTE,"representative of the poet.  One side only, and that the least, is"
872,NOTE,"shown, for a greater pen than mine would be necessary if that tornado"
873,NOTE,"of rage, eloquence, and humour were to be presented; but the poems"
874,NOTE,which I give might almost be taken as translations of one side of his
875,NOTE,terrific muse.
876,NOTE,
877,NOTE,As regards Egan O'Rahilly a similar remark is necessary.  No pen and no
878,NOTE,language but his own could even distantly indicate a skill and melody
879,NOTE,which might be spoken of as one of the wonders of the world.  I have
880,NOTE,done exactly as I pleased with his material.
881,NOTE,
882,NOTE,"From Antoine O'Raftery I have taken more than from any of the others,"
883,NOTE,and have in nearly every instance treated his matter so familiarly that
884,NOTE,"a lover of Raftery (and who, having read a verse of his, does not love"
885,NOTE,him?) might not know I was indebted to this poet for my songs.  His
886,NOTE,"work is different from that of Keating, O'Rahilly, or O'Bruadair, for"
887,NOTE,"these were learned men, and were writing out of a tradition so hoary"
888,NOTE,with age and so complicated in convention that only learned and subtle
889,NOTE,minds could attempt it.  I have wondered would Keating or O'Rahilly
890,NOTE,have been very scornful of Raftery's work?  I think they might have
891,NOTE,"been angry at such an ignorance of all the rules, and would probably"
892,NOTE,"have torn the paper on which his poems were written, and sat down to"
893,NOTE,"compose a satire which would have raised blisters on that poor, blind,"
894,NOTE,"wandering singer, the master of them all."
895,NOTE,
896,NOTE,In two of the poems which I tried to translate from Raftery I have
897,NOTE,completely failed.  Against one of them I broke an hundred pens in
898,NOTE,"vain; and in the other, ""The County Mayo,"" I have been so close to"
899,NOTE,success and so far from succeeding that I may mourn a little about it.
900,NOTE,"The first three verses are not bad, but the last verse is the"
901,NOTE,"completest miss: the simplicity of the original is there, its music is"
902,NOTE,"not, and in the last two lines the poignance, which should come on the"
903,NOTE,"reader as though a hand gripped at his heart, is absent.  The other"
904,NOTE,failure I have not printed because I could get no way on it at all: it
905,NOTE,would not even begin to translate.  This is Raftery's reply to the man
906,NOTE,"who did not recognise him as he fiddled to a crowd, and asked ""who is"
907,NOTE,"the musician?"""

928,NOTE,that there was often little difference between them and beggars.  They
929,NOTE,all sing of their poverty: Keating as a fact to be recorded among other
930,NOTE,"facts, O'Rahilly in a very stately and bitter complaint, and Raftery as"
931,NOTE,"in the quotation above; but O'Bruadair lets out of him an unending,"
