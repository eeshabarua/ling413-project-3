95,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,The Children of the Night
96,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,
97,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,
98,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,
99,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"For those that never know the light,"
100,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,The darkness is a sullen thing;
101,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"And they, the Children of the Night,"
102,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,Seem lost in Fortune's winnowing.
103,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,
104,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"But some are strong and some are weak, --"
105,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,And there's the story.  House and home
106,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,Are shut from countless hearts that seek
107,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,World-refuge that will never come.
108,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,
109,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"And if there be no other life,"
110,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,And if there be no other chance
111,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,To weigh their sorrow and their strife
112,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"Than in the scales of circumstance,"
113,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,
114,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"'T were better, ere the sun go down"
115,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"Upon the first day we embark,"
116,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"In life's imbittered sea to drown,"
117,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,Than sail forever in the dark.
118,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,
119,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,But if there be a soul on earth
120,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,So blinded with its own misuse
121,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"Of man's revealed, incessant worth,"
122,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"Or worn with anguish, that it views"
123,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,
124,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"No light but for a mortal eye,"
125,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"No rest but of a mortal sleep,"
126,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"No God but in a prophet's lie,"
127,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"No faith for ""honest doubt"" to keep;"
128,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,
129,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"If there be nothing, good or bad,"
130,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"But chaos for a soul to trust, --"
131,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"God counts it for a soul gone mad,"
132,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"And if God be God, He is just."
133,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,
134,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"And if God be God, He is Love;"
135,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"And though the Dawn be still so dim,"
136,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,It shows us we have played enough
137,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,With creeds that make a fiend of Him.
138,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,
139,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"There is one creed, and only one,"
140,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,That glorifies God's excellence;
141,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"So cherish, that His will be done,"
142,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,The common creed of common sense.
143,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,
144,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"It is the crimson, not the gray,"
145,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,That charms the twilight of all time;
146,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,It is the promise of the day
147,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,That makes the starry sky sublime;
148,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,
149,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,It is the faith within the fear
150,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,That holds us to the life we curse; --
151,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,So let us in ourselves revere
152,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,The Self which is the Universe!
153,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,
154,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"Let us, the Children of the Night,"
155,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,Put off the cloak that hides the scar!
156,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,"Let us be Children of the Light,"
157,THE CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT,And tell the ages what we are!

166,I,I
167,I,
168,I,
169,I,As long as Fame's imperious music rings
170,I,Will poets mock it with crowned words august;
171,I,And haggard men will clamber to be kings
172,I,As long as Glory weighs itself in dust.
173,I,
174,I,
175,I,
176,II,II
177,II,
178,II,
179,II,"Drink to the splendor of the unfulfilled,"
180,II,Nor shudder for the revels that are done:
181,II,"The wines that flushed Lucullus are all spilled,"
182,II,The strings that Nero fingered are all gone.
183,II,
184,II,
185,II,
186,III,III
187,III,
188,III,
189,III,"We cannot crown ourselves with everything,"
190,III,Nor can we coax the Fates for us to quarrel:
191,III,"No matter what we are, or what we sing,"
192,III,Time finds a withered leaf in every laurel.
193,III,
194,III,
195,III,
196,III,
197,III,The World
198,III,
199,III,
200,III,
201,III,"Some are the brothers of all humankind,"
202,III,"And own them, whatsoever their estate;"
203,III,"And some, for sorrow and self-scorn, are blind"
204,III,With enmity for man's unguarded fate.
205,III,
206,III,For some there is a music all day long
207,III,"Like flutes in Paradise, they are so glad;"
208,III,And there is hell's eternal under-song
209,III,Of curses and the cries of men gone mad.
210,III,
211,III,"Some say the Scheme with love stands luminous,"
212,III,Some say 't were better back to chaos hurled;
213,III,And so 't is what we are that makes for us
214,III,The measure and the meaning of the world.
215,III,
216,III,
217,III,
218,III,
219,III,An Old Story
220,III,
221,III,
222,III,
223,III,"Strange that I did not know him then,"
224,III,That friend of mine!
225,III,I did not even show him then
226,III,One friendly sign;
227,III,
228,III,But cursed him for the ways he had
229,III,To make me see
230,III,My envy of the praise he had
231,III,For praising me.
232,III,
233,III,I would have rid the earth of him
234,III,"Once, in my pride! . . ."
235,III,I never knew the worth of him
236,III,Until he died.
237,III,
238,III,
239,III,
240,III,
241,III,Ballade of a Ship
242,III,
243,III,
244,III,
245,III,Down by the flash of the restless water
246,III,The dim White Ship like a white bird lay;
247,III,"Laughing at life and the world they sought her,"
248,III,And out she swung to the silvering bay.
249,III,"Then off they flew on their roystering way,"
250,III,And the keen moon fired the light foam flying
251,III,"Up from the flood where the faint stars play,"
252,III,And the bones of the brave in the wave are lying.
253,III,
254,III,"'T was a king's fair son with a king's fair daughter,"
255,III,"And full three hundred beside, they say, --"
256,III,"Revelling on for the lone, cold slaughter"
257,III,So soon to seize them and hide them for aye;
258,III,"But they danced and they drank and their souls grew gay,"
259,III,Nor ever they knew of a ghoul's eye spying
260,III,Their splendor a flickering phantom to stray
261,III,Where the bones of the brave in the wave are lying.
262,III,
263,III,Through the mist of a drunken dream they brought her
264,III,(This wild white bird) for the sea-fiend's prey:
265,III,"The pitiless reef in his hard clutch caught her,"
266,III,And hurled her down where the dead men stay.
267,III,A torturing silence of wan dismay --
268,III,Shrieks and curses of mad souls dying --
269,III,Then down they sank to slumber and sway
270,III,Where the bones of the brave in the wave are lying.
271,III,
272,ENVOY,ENVOY
273,ENVOY,
274,ENVOY,"Prince, do you sleep to the sound alway"
275,ENVOY,Of the mournful surge and the sea-birds' crying? --
276,ENVOY,"Or does love still shudder and steel still slay,"
277,ENVOY,Where the bones of the brave in the wave are lying?
278,ENVOY,
279,ENVOY,
280,ENVOY,
281,ENVOY,
282,ENVOY,Ballade by the Fire
283,ENVOY,
284,ENVOY,
285,ENVOY,
286,ENVOY,"Slowly I smoke and hug my knee,"
287,ENVOY,The while a witless masquerade
288,ENVOY,Of things that only children see
289,ENVOY,Floats in a mist of light and shade:
290,ENVOY,"They pass, a flimsy cavalcade,"
291,ENVOY,"And with a weak, remindful glow,"
292,ENVOY,"The falling embers break and fade,"
293,ENVOY,As one by one the phantoms go.
294,ENVOY,
295,ENVOY,"Then, with a melancholy glee"
296,ENVOY,"To think where once my fancy strayed,"
297,ENVOY,I muse on what the years may be
298,ENVOY,"Whose coming tales are all unsaid,"
299,ENVOY,"Till tongs and shovel, snugly laid"
300,ENVOY,"Within their shadowed niches, grow"
301,ENVOY,"By grim degrees to pick and spade,"
302,ENVOY,As one by one the phantoms go.
303,ENVOY,
304,ENVOY,"But then, what though the mystic Three"
305,ENVOY,Around me ply their merry trade? --
306,ENVOY,And Charon soon may carry me
307,ENVOY,Across the gloomy Stygian glade? --
308,ENVOY,"Be up, my soul! nor be afraid"
309,ENVOY,Of what some unborn year may show;
310,ENVOY,"But mind your human debts are paid,"
311,ENVOY,As one by one the phantoms go.
312,ENVOY,
313,ENVOY,ENVOY
314,ENVOY,
315,ENVOY,Life is the game that must be played:
316,ENVOY,"This truth at least, good friend, we know;"
317,ENVOY,"So live and laugh, nor be dismayed"
318,ENVOY,As one by one the phantoms go.
319,ENVOY,
320,ENVOY,
321,ENVOY,
322,ENVOY,
323,ENVOY,Ballade of Broken Flutes
324,ENVOY,
325,ENVOY,(To A. T. Schumann.)
326,ENVOY,
327,ENVOY,
328,ENVOY,
329,ENVOY,"In dreams I crossed a barren land,"
330,ENVOY,"A land of ruin, far away;"
331,ENVOY,Around me hung on every hand
332,ENVOY,A deathful stillness of decay;
333,ENVOY,"And silent, as in bleak dismay"
334,ENVOY,"That song should thus forsaken be,"
335,ENVOY,On that forgotten ground there lay
336,ENVOY,The broken flutes of Arcady.
337,ENVOY,
338,ENVOY,The forest that was all so grand
339,ENVOY,When pipes and tabors had their sway
340,ENVOY,"Stood leafless now, a ghostly band"
341,ENVOY,Of skeletons in cold array.
342,ENVOY,A lonely surge of ancient spray
343,ENVOY,"Told of an unforgetful sea,"
344,ENVOY,But iron blows had hushed for aye
345,ENVOY,The broken flutes of Arcady.
346,ENVOY,
347,ENVOY,"No more by summer breezes fanned,"
348,ENVOY,The place was desolate and gray;
349,ENVOY,But still my dream was to command
350,ENVOY,New life into that shrunken clay.
351,ENVOY,"I tried it.  Yes, you scan to-day,"
352,ENVOY,"With uncommiserating glee,"
353,ENVOY,The songs of one who strove to play
354,ENVOY,The broken flutes of Arcady.
355,ENVOY,
356,ENVOY,ENVOY
357,ENVOY,
358,ENVOY,"So, Rock, I join the common fray,"
359,ENVOY,To fight where Mammon may decree;
360,ENVOY,"And leave, to crumble as they may,"
361,ENVOY,The broken flutes of Arcady.
362,ENVOY,
363,ENVOY,
364,ENVOY,
365,ENVOY,
366,ENVOY,Ballade of Dead Friends
367,ENVOY,
368,ENVOY,
369,ENVOY,
370,ENVOY,As we the withered ferns
371,ENVOY,"By the roadway lying,"
372,ENVOY,"Time, the jester, spurns"
373,ENVOY,All our prayers and prying --
374,ENVOY,"All our tears and sighing,"
375,ENVOY,"Sorrow, change, and woe --"
376,ENVOY,All our where-and-whying
377,ENVOY,For friends that come and go.
378,ENVOY,
379,ENVOY,"Life awakes and burns,"
380,ENVOY,"Age and death defying,"
381,ENVOY,Till at last it learns
382,ENVOY,All but Love is dying;
383,ENVOY,"Love's the trade we're plying,"
384,ENVOY,God has willed it so;
385,ENVOY,Shrouds are what we're buying
386,ENVOY,For friends that come and go.
387,ENVOY,
388,ENVOY,Man forever yearns
389,ENVOY,For the thing that's flying.
390,ENVOY,"Everywhere he turns,"
391,ENVOY,"Men to dust are drying, --"
392,ENVOY,"Dust that wanders, eying"
393,ENVOY,(With eyes that hardly glow)
394,ENVOY,"New faces, dimly spying"
395,ENVOY,For friends that come and go.
396,ENVOY,
397,ENVOY,ENVOY
398,ENVOY,
399,ENVOY,And thus we all are nighing
400,ENVOY,The truth we fear to know:
401,ENVOY,Death will end our crying
402,ENVOY,For friends that come and go.
403,ENVOY,
404,ENVOY,
405,ENVOY,
406,ENVOY,
407,ENVOY,Her Eyes
408,ENVOY,
409,ENVOY,
410,ENVOY,
411,ENVOY,"Up from the street and the crowds that went,"
412,ENVOY,"Morning and midnight, to and fro,"
413,ENVOY,"Still was the room where his days he spent,"
414,ENVOY,"And the stars were bleak, and the nights were slow."
415,ENVOY,
416,ENVOY,"Year after year, with his dream shut fast,"
417,ENVOY,"He suffered and strove till his eyes were dim,"
418,ENVOY,"For the love that his brushes had earned at last, --"
419,ENVOY,And the whole world rang with the praise of him.
420,ENVOY,
421,ENVOY,"But he cloaked his triumph, and searched, instead,"
422,ENVOY,Till his cheeks were sere and his hairs were gray.
423,ENVOY,"""There are women enough, God knows,"" he said. . . ."
424,ENVOY,"""There are stars enough -- when the sun's away."""
425,ENVOY,
426,ENVOY,Then he went back to the same still room
427,ENVOY,"That had held his dream in the long ago,"
428,ENVOY,"When he buried his days in a nameless tomb,"
429,ENVOY,"And the stars were bleak, and the nights were slow."
430,ENVOY,
431,ENVOY,And a passionate humor seized him there --
432,ENVOY,Seized him and held him until there grew
433,ENVOY,"Like life on his canvas, glowing and fair,"
434,ENVOY,"A perilous face -- and an angel's, too."
435,ENVOY,
436,ENVOY,"Angel and maiden, and all in one, --"
437,ENVOY,"All but the eyes.  -- They were there, but yet"
438,ENVOY,They seemed somehow like a soul half done.
439,ENVOY,What was the matter?  Did God forget? . . .
440,ENVOY,
441,ENVOY,But he wrought them at last with a skill so sure
442,ENVOY,"That her eyes were the eyes of a deathless woman, --"
443,ENVOY,"With a gleam of heaven to make them pure,"
444,ENVOY,And a glimmer of hell to make them human.
445,ENVOY,
446,ENVOY,God never forgets.  -- And he worships her
447,ENVOY,"There in that same still room of his,"
448,ENVOY,"For his wife, and his constant arbiter"
449,ENVOY,Of the world that was and the world that is.
450,ENVOY,
451,ENVOY,And he wonders yet what her love could be
452,ENVOY,To punish him after that strife so grim;
453,ENVOY,"But the longer he lives with her eyes to see,"
454,ENVOY,The plainer it all comes back to him.
455,ENVOY,
456,ENVOY,
457,ENVOY,
458,ENVOY,
459,ENVOY,Two Men
460,ENVOY,
461,ENVOY,
462,ENVOY,
463,ENVOY,There be two men of all mankind
464,ENVOY,That I should like to know about;
465,ENVOY,"But search and question where I will,"
466,ENVOY,I cannot ever find them out.
467,ENVOY,
468,ENVOY,"Melchizedek he praised the Lord,"
469,ENVOY,And gave some wine to Abraham;
470,ENVOY,But who can tell what else he did
471,ENVOY,Must be more learned than I am.
472,ENVOY,
473,ENVOY,Ucalegon he lost his house
474,ENVOY,When Agamemnon came to Troy;
475,ENVOY,But who can tell me who he was --
476,ENVOY,I'll pray the gods to give him joy.
477,ENVOY,
478,ENVOY,There be two men of all mankind
479,ENVOY,That I'm forever thinking on:
480,ENVOY,"They chase me everywhere I go, --"
481,ENVOY,"Melchizedek, Ucalegon."
482,ENVOY,
483,ENVOY,
484,ENVOY,
485,ENVOY,
486,ENVOY,Villanelle of Change
487,ENVOY,
488,ENVOY,
489,ENVOY,
490,ENVOY,"Since Persia fell at Marathon,"
491,ENVOY,The yellow years have gathered fast:
492,ENVOY,Long centuries have come and gone.
493,ENVOY,
494,ENVOY,And yet (they say) the place will don
495,ENVOY,"A phantom fury of the past,"
496,ENVOY,Since Persia fell at Marathon;
497,ENVOY,
498,ENVOY,"And as of old, when Helicon"
499,ENVOY,Trembled and swayed with rapture vast
500,ENVOY,"(Long centuries have come and gone),"
501,ENVOY,
502,ENVOY,"This ancient plain, when night comes on,"
503,ENVOY,"Shakes to a ghostly battle-blast,"
504,ENVOY,Since Persia fell at Marathon.

649,ENVOY,
650,ENVOY,"And he was rich, -- yes, richer than a king, --"
651,ENVOY,And admirably schooled in every grace:
652,ENVOY,"In fine, we thought that he was everything"
653,ENVOY,To make us wish that we were in his place.
654,ENVOY,
655,ENVOY,"So on we worked, and waited for the light,"

769,II,"Sweeping the chords of Hellas with firm hand,"
770,II,"He wakes lost echoes from song's classic shore,"

772,II,To touch the clouds and sorrows of a land
773,II,"Where God's truth, cramped and fettered with a band"
774,II,"Of iron creeds, he cheers with golden lore"
775,II,Of heroes and the men that long before
776,II,Wrought the romance of ages yet unscanned.
777,II,
778,II,Still does a cry through sad Valhalla go
779,II,"For Balder, pierced with Lok's unhappy spray --"

796,II,Of his complaint such quaver and such moan

799,II,"An ancient woman, shrunk to skin and bone."
800,II,
801,II,Far out beyond the forest I could hear
802,II,"The calling of loud progress, and the bold"

866,II,Words out of lips that were no more to speak --
867,II,Words of the past that shook the old man's cheek
868,II,"Like dead, remembered footsteps on old floors."
869,II,
870,II,And then there were the leaves that plagued him so!
871,II,"The brown, thin leaves that on the stones outside"
872,II,Skipped with a freezing whisper.  Now and then

890,II,"Through scattered fangs a few snarled words and close,"
891,II,As if a cur were chary of its bark.
892,II,
893,II,"Glad for the murmur of his hard renown,"

914,II,The fruitage of a life that was my own.
915,II,

1501,II,The broken key to the fairies' castle
1502,II,"That held my life in the fresh, glad season"
1503,II,When I was the king of the earth.  Then slowly --
1504,II,And yet so swiftly! -- there came the knowledge
1505,II,That the marvellous life I had lived was my life;
1506,II,That the glorious world I had loved was my world;
1507,II,"And that every man, and every woman,"
1508,II,"And every child was a different being,"
1509,II,"Wrought with a different heat, and fired"
1510,II,With passions born of a single spirit;
1511,II,"That the pleasure I felt was not their pleasure,"
1512,II,Nor my sorrow -- a kind of nameless pity
1513,II,"For something, I knew not what -- their sorrow."
1514,II,"And thus was I taught my first hard lesson, --"
1515,II,The lesson we suffer the most in learning:
1516,II,That a happy man is a man forgetful
1517,II,Of all the torturing ills around him.
1518,II,When or where I first met the woman
1519,II,"I cherished and made my wife, no matter."
1520,II,Enough to say that I found her and kept her
1521,II,Here in my heart with as pure a devotion
1522,II,As ever Christ felt for his brothers.  Forgive me
1523,II,For naming His name in your patient presence;
1524,II,"But I feel my words, and the truth I utter"
1525,II,"Is God's own truth.  I loved that woman, --"
1526,II,"Not for her face, but for something fairer,"
1527,II,"Something diviner, I thought, than beauty:"
1528,II,I loved the spirit -- the human something
1529,II,"That seemed to chime with my own condition,"
1530,II,And make soul-music when we were together;
1531,II,"And we were never apart, from the moment"
1532,II,My eyes flashed into her eyes the message
1533,II,That swept itself in a quivering answer
1534,II,Back through my strange lost being.  My pulses
1535,II,Leapt with an aching speed; and the measure
1536,II,"Of this great world grew small and smaller,"
1537,II,Till it seemed the sky and the land and the ocean
1538,II,Closed at last in a mist all golden
1539,II,Around us two.  And we stood for a season
1540,II,"Like gods outflung from chaos, dreaming"
1541,II,That we were the king and the queen of the fire
1542,II,That reddened the clouds of love that held us
1543,II,Blind to the new world soon to be ours --
1544,II,Ours to seize and sway.  The passion
1545,II,"Of that great love was a nameless passion,"
1546,II,"Bright as the blaze of the sun at noonday,"
1547,II,"Wild as the flames of hell; but, mark you,"
1548,II,Never a whit less pure for its fervor.
1549,II,The baseness in me (for I was human)
1550,II,"Burned like a worm, and perished; and nothing"
1551,II,Was left me then but a soul that mingled
1552,II,"Itself with hers, and swayed and shuddered"
1553,II,In fearful triumph.  When I consider
1554,II,That helpless love and the cursed folly
1555,II,That wrecked my life for the sake of a woman
1556,II,Who broke with a laugh the chains of her marriage
1557,II,"(Whatever the word may mean), I wonder"
1558,II,"If all the woe was her sin, or whether"
1559,II,The chains themselves were enough to lead her
1560,II,In love's despite to break them. . . .  Sinners
1561,II,"And saints -- I say -- are rocked in the cradle,"
1562,II,But never are known till the will within them
1563,II,Speaks in its own good time.  So I foster
1564,II,"Even to-night for the woman who wronged me,"
1565,II,"Nothing of hate, nor of love, but a feeling"
1566,II,"Of still regret; for the man --  But hear me,"
1567,II,And judge for yourself: --
1568,II,
1569,II,For a time the seasons
1570,II,Changed and passed in a sweet succession
1571,II,That seemed to me like an endless music:
1572,II,"Life was a rolling psalm, and the choirs"
1573,II,Of God were glad for our love.  I fancied
1574,II,"All this, and more than I dare to tell you"
1575,II,"To-night, -- yes, more than I dare to remember;"
1576,II,"And then -- well, the music stopped.  There are moments"
1577,II,"In all men's lives when it stops, I fancy, --"
1578,II,"Or seems to stop, -- till it comes to cheer them"
1579,II,Again with a larger sound.  The curtain
1580,II,Of life just then is lifted a little
1581,II,To give to their sight new joys -- new sorrows --
1582,II,"Or nothing at all, sometimes.  I was watching"
1583,II,"The slow, sweet scenes of a golden picture,"
1584,II,Flushed and alive with a long delusion
1585,II,"That made the murmur of home, when I shuddered"
1586,II,And felt like a knife that awful silence
1587,II,That comes when the music goes -- forever.
1588,II,The truth came over my life like a darkness
1589,II,"Over a forest where one man wanders,"
1590,II,Worse than alone.  For a time I staggered
1591,II,And stumbled on with a weak persistence
1592,II,After the phantom of hope that darted
1593,II,"And dodged like a frightened thing before me,"
1594,II,"To quit me at last, and vanish.  Nothing"
1595,II,Was left me then but the curse of living
1596,II,And bearing through all my days the fever
1597,II,"And thirst of a poisoned love.  Were I stronger,"
1598,II,"Or weaker, perhaps my scorn had saved me,"
1599,II,Given me strength to crush my sorrow
1600,II,With hate for her and the world that praised her --
1601,II,"To have left her, then and there -- to have conquered"
1602,II,"That old false life with a new and a wiser, --"
1603,II,"Such things are easy in words.  You listen,"
1604,II,"And frown, I suppose, that I never mention"
1605,II,"That beautiful word, FORGIVE! -- I forgave her"
1606,II,First of all; and I praised kind Heaven
1607,II,"That I was a brave, clean man to do it;"
1608,II,And then I tried to forget.  Forgiveness!
1609,II,What does it mean when the one forgiven
1610,II,Shivers and weeps and clings and kisses
1611,II,"The credulous fool that holds her, and tells him"
1612,II,"A thousand things of a good man's mercy,"
1613,II,And then slips off with a laugh and plunges
1614,II,"Back to the sin she has quit for a season,"
1615,II,To tell him that hell and the world are better
1616,II,"For her than a prophet's heaven?  Believe me,"
1617,II,The love that dies ere its flames are wasted
1618,II,"In search of an alien soul is better,"
1619,II,Better by far than the lonely passion
1620,II,That burns back into the heart that feeds it.
1621,II,"For I loved her still, and the more she mocked me, --"
1622,II,Fooled with her endless pleading promise
1623,II,"Of future faith, -- the more I believed her"
1624,II,The penitent thing she seemed; and the stronger
1625,II,Her choking arms and her small hot kisses
1626,II,"Bound me and burned my brain to pity,"
1627,II,The more she grew to the heavenly creature
1628,II,That brightened the life I had lost forever.
1629,II,The truth was gone somehow for the moment;
1630,II,The curtain fell for a time; and I fancied
1631,II,"We were again like gods together,"
1632,II,Loving again with the old glad rapture.
1633,II,"But scenes like these, too often repeated,"
1634,II,"Failed at last, and her guile was wasted."
1635,II,I made an end of her shrewd caresses
1636,II,And told her a few straight words.  She took them
1637,II,Full at their worth -- and the farce was over.
1638,II,.    .    .    .    .
1639,II,"At first my dreams of the past upheld me,"
1640,II,But they were a short support:  the present
1641,II,"Pushed them away, and I fell.  The mission"
1642,II,Of life (whatever it was) was blasted;
1643,II,My game was lost.  And I met the winner
1644,II,Of that foul deal as a sick slave gathers
1645,II,His painful strength at the sight of his master;
1646,II,"And when he was past I cursed him, fearful"
1647,II,Of that strange chance which makes us mighty
1648,II,"Or mean, or both.  I cursed him and hated"
1649,II,The stones he pressed with his heel; I followed
1650,II,"His easy march with a backward envy,"
1651,II,And cursed myself for the beast within me.
1652,II,"But pride is the master of love, and the vision"
1653,II,Of those old days grew faint and fainter:
1654,II,The counterfeit wife my mercy sheltered
1655,II,"Was nothing now but a woman, -- a woman"
1656,II,Out of my way and out of my nature.
1657,II,"My battle with blinded love was over,"
1658,II,My battle with aching pride beginning.
1659,II,"If I was the loser at first, I wonder"
1660,II,If I am the winner now! . . .  I doubt it.
1661,II,My life is a losing game; and to-morrow --
1662,II,To-morrow! -- Christ! did I say to-morrow? . . .
1663,II,"Is your brandy good for death? . . .  There, -- listen: --"
1664,II,
1665,II,"When love goes out, and a man is driven"
1666,II,To shun mankind for the scars that make him
1667,II,"A joke for all chattering tongues, he carries"
1668,II,A double burden.  The woes I suffered
1669,II,After that hard betrayal made me
1670,II,"Pity, at first, all breathing creatures"
1671,II,On this bewildered earth.  I studied
1672,II,Their faces and made for myself the story
1673,II,Of all their scattered lives.  Like brothers
1674,II,And sisters they seemed to me then; and I nourished
1675,II,A stranger friendship wrought in my fancy
1676,II,"Between those people and me.  But somehow,"
1677,II,"As time went on, there came queer glances"
1678,II,"Out of their eyes, and the shame that stung me"
1679,II,Harassed my pride with a crazed impression
1680,II,That every face in the surging city
1681,II,"Was turned to me; and I saw sly whispers,"
1682,II,"Now and then, as I walked and wearied"
1683,II,My wasted life twice over in bearing
1684,II,"With all my sorrow the sorrows of others, --"
1685,II,"Till I found myself their fool.  Then I trembled, --"
1686,II,"A poor scared thing, -- and their prying faces"
1687,II,Told me the ghastly truth:  they were laughing
1688,II,"At me and my fate.  My God, I could feel it --"
1689,II,That laughter!  And then the children caught it;
1690,II,"And I, like a struck dog, crept and listened."
1691,II,And then when I met the man who had weakened
1692,II,"A woman's love to his own desire,"
1693,II,It seemed to me that all hell were laughing
1694,II,In fiendish concert!  I was their victim --
1695,II,"And his, and hate's.  And there was the struggle!"
1696,II,As long as the earth we tread holds something
1697,II,"A tortured heart can love, the meaning"
1698,II,Of life is not wholly blurred; but after
1699,II,"The last loved thing in the world has left us,"
1700,II,We know the triumph of hate.  The glory
1701,II,Of good goes out forever; the beacon
1702,II,Of sin is the light that leads us downward --
1703,II,Down to the fiery end.  The road runs
1704,II,Right through hell; and the souls that follow
1705,II,The cursed ways where its windings lead them
1706,II,"Suffer enough, I say, to merit"
1707,II,All grace that a God can give. --  The fashion
1708,II,Of our belief is to lift all beings
1709,II,Born for a life that knows no struggle
1710,II,In sin's tight snares to eternal glory --
1711,II,All apart from the branded millions
1712,II,Who carry through life their faces graven
1713,II,With sure brute scars that tell the story
1714,II,"Of their foul, fated passions.  Science"
1715,II,Has yet no salve to smooth or soften
1716,II,The cradle-scars of a tyrant's visage;
1717,II,No drug to purge from the vital essence
1718,II,Of souls the sleeping venom.  Virtue
1719,II,"May flower in hell, when its roots are twisted"
1720,II,And wound with the roots of vice; but the stronger
1721,II,Never is known till there comes that battle
1722,II,With sin to prove the victor.  Perilous
1723,II,Things are these demons we call our passions:
1724,II,"Slaves are we of their roving fancies,"
1725,II,"Fools of their devilish glee. --  You think me,"
1726,II,"I know, in this maundering way designing"
1727,II,To lighten the load of my guilt and cast it
1728,II,Half on the shoulders of God.  But hear me!
1729,II,"I'm partly a man, -- for all my weakness, --"
1730,II,If weakness it were to stand and murder
1731,II,Before men's eyes the man who had murdered
1732,II,"Me, and driven my burning forehead"
1733,II,With horns for the world to laugh at.  Trust me!
1734,II,And try to believe my words but a portion
1735,II,Of what God's purpose made me!  The coward
1736,II,Within me cries for this; and I beg you
1737,II,"Now, as I come to the end, to remember"
1738,II,That women and men are on earth to travel
1739,II,All on a different road.  Hereafter
1740,II,The roads may meet. . . .  I trust in something --
1741,II,I know not what. . . .
1742,II,
1743,II,"Well, this was the way of it: --"
1744,II,Stung with the shame and the secret fury
1745,II,That comes to the man who has thrown his pittance
1746,II,"Of self at a traitor's feet, I wandered"
1747,II,"Weeks and weeks in a baffled frenzy,"
1748,II,"Till at last the devil spoke.  I heard him,"
1749,II,"And laughed at the love that strove to touch me, --"
1750,II,"The dead, lost love; and I gripped the demon"
1751,II,"Close to my breast, and held him, praising"
1752,II,The fates and the furies that gave me the courage
1753,II,To follow his wild command.  Forgetful
1754,II,"Of all to come when the work was over, --"
1755,II,There came to me then no stony vision
1756,II,"Of these three hundred days, -- I cherished"
1757,II,An awful joy in my brain.  I pondered
1758,II,"And weighed the thing in my mind, and gloried"
1759,II,In life to think that I was to conquer
1760,II,"Death at his own dark door, -- and chuckled"
1761,II,To think of it done so cleanly.  One evening
1762,II,I knew that my time had come.  I shuddered
1763,II,"A little, but rather for doubt than terror,"
1764,II,"And followed him, -- led by the nameless devil"
1765,II,I worshipped and called my brother.  The city
1766,II,Shone like a dream that night; the windows
1767,II,"Flashed with a piercing flame, and the pavements"
1768,II,Pulsed and swayed with a warmth -- or something
1769,II,That seemed so then to my feet -- and thrilled me
1770,II,"With a quick, dizzy joy; and the women"
1771,II,"And men, like marvellous things of magic,"
1772,II,"Floated and laughed and sang by my shoulder,"
1773,II,Sent with a wizard motion.  Through it
1774,II,And over and under it all there sounded
1775,II,"A murmur of life, like bees; and I listened"
1776,II,And laughed again to think of the flower
1777,II,"That grew, blood-red, for me! . . .  This fellow"
1778,II,Was one of the popular sort who flourish
1779,II,Unruffled where gods would fall.  For a conscience
1780,II,He carried a snug deceit that made him
1781,II,"The man of the time and the place, whatever"
1782,II,"The time or the place might be.  Were he sounding,"
1783,II,"With a genial craft that cloaked its purpose,"
1784,II,"Nigh to itself, the depth of a woman"
1785,II,"Fooled with his brainless art, or sending"
1786,II,"The midnight home with songs and bottles, --"
1787,II,"The cad was there, and his ease forever"
1788,II,Shone with the smooth and slippery polish
1789,II,That tells the snake.  That night he drifted
1790,II,Into an up-town haunt and ordered --
1791,II,Whatever it was -- with a soft assurance
1792,II,"That made me mad as I stood behind him,"
1793,II,"Gripping his death, and waited.  Coward,"
1794,II,"I think, is the name the world has given"
1795,II,To men like me; but I'll swear I never
1796,II,Thought of my own disgrace when I shot him --
1797,II,"Yes, in the back, -- I know it, I know it"
1798,II,Now; but what if I do? . . .  As I watched him
1799,II,"Lying there dead in the scattered sawdust,"
1800,II,"Wet with a day's blown froth, I noted"
1801,II,"That things were still; that the walnut tables,"
1802,II,"Where men but a moment before were sitting,"
1803,II,Were gone; that a screen of something around me
1804,II,Shut them out of my sight.  But the gilded
1805,II,Signs of a hundred beers and whiskeys
1806,II,"Flashed from the walls above, and the mirrors"
1807,II,And glasses behind the bar were lighted
1808,II,"In some strange way, and into my spirit"
1809,II,A thousand shafts of terrible fire
1810,II,"Burned like death, and I fell.  The story"
1811,II,"Of what came then, you know."
1812,II,
1813,II,"But tell me,"
1814,II,"What does the whole thing mean?  What are we, --"
1815,II,Slaves of an awful ignorance? puppets
1816,II,"Pulled by a fiend? or gods, without knowing it?"
1817,II,"Do we shut from ourselves our own salvation, --"
1818,II,"Or what do we do!  I tell you, Dominie,"
1819,II,There are times in the lives of us poor devils
1820,II,When heaven and hell get mixed.  Though conscience
1821,II,May come like a whisper of Christ to warn us
1822,II,"Away from our sins, it is lost or laughed at, --"
1823,II,And then we fall.  And for all who have fallen --
1824,II,"Even for him -- I hold no malice,"
1825,II,Nor much compassion:  a mightier mercy
1826,II,Than mine must shrive him. --  And I -- I am going
1827,II,Into the light? -- or into the darkness?
1828,II,"Why do I sit through these sickening hours,"
1829,II,And hope?  Good God! are they hours? -- hours?
1830,II,Yes!  I am done with days.  And to-morrow --
1831,II,We two may meet!  To-morrow! --  To-morrow! . . .

1840,II,"The master-songs are ended, and the man"

1850,II,We do not hear him very much to-day:
1851,II,His piercing and eternal cadence rings
1852,II,"Too pure for us -- too powerfully pure,"
1853,II,"Too lovingly triumphant, and too large;"
1854,II,"But there are some that hear him, and they know"
1855,II,"That he shall sing to-morrow for all men,"
1856,II,And that all time shall listen.

1929,II,Of a dirge that sings to send us back to the arms of those that love us.
1930,II,There is nothing left but ashes now where the crimson chills of autumn
1931,II,Put off the summer's languor with a touch that made us glad
1932,II,"For the glory that is gone from us, with a flight we cannot follow,"

1934,II,

1941,II,Are barren for the lights of home and a flame that's young forever;
1942,II,"And the lonely trees around us creak the warning of the night-wind,"
1943,II,That love and all the dreams of love are away beyond the mountains.
1944,II,"The songs that call for us to-night, they have called for men before us,"
1945,II,"And the winds that blow the message, they have blown ten thousand years;"
1946,II,"But this will end our wander-time, for we know the joy that waits us"

1954,II,"Come away! come away! -- or the roving-fiend will hold us,"

1956,II,"There are no men yet can leave him when his hands are clutched upon them,"
1957,II,"There are none will own his enmity, there are none will call him brother."
1958,II,"So we'll be up and on the way, and the less we brag the better"
