34,INTRODUCTION.,
35,INTRODUCTION.,Since there is room in this volume for more verses than Colonel Hay’s
36,INTRODUCTION.,"{9}, I have added to them a few poems by Sir Walter Scott; the first"
37,INTRODUCTION.,written in 1811 at the time of the struggle with Napoleon in the
38,INTRODUCTION.,"Peninsula, the second in 1815, after Waterloo.  Thus there is over all"
39,INTRODUCTION.,this volume a thin haze of battle through which we see only the finer
40,INTRODUCTION.,feelings and the nobler hopes of man.  The day is to come when war shall
41,INTRODUCTION.,"be no more, but wars have been and may again be necessary to bring on"
42,INTRODUCTION.,"that day; and it is of such war, not untinged with the light of heaven,"
43,INTRODUCTION.,that we have passing shadows in this little book.
44,INTRODUCTION.,
45,INTRODUCTION.,"“The Vision of Don Roderick; a Poem, by Walter Scott, Esq.,” was printed"
46,INTRODUCTION.,at Edinburgh by James Ballantyne & Co. in 1811.  They are the present
47,INTRODUCTION.,representatives of that firm by whom it is here reprinted.  It was
48,INTRODUCTION.,"originally inscribed “to John Whitmore, Esq., and to the Committee of"
49,INTRODUCTION.,"Subscribers for relief of the Portuguese Sufferers, in which he"
50,INTRODUCTION.,"presides,” as a “poem composed for the benefit of the Fund under their"
51,INTRODUCTION.,management.”
52,INTRODUCTION.,
53,INTRODUCTION.,The Legend of Don Roderick will be given in the next volume of our
54,INTRODUCTION.,"“Companion Poets,” for Robert Southey founded upon it a Romantic Tale in"
55,INTRODUCTION.,"Verse, which is one of the best tales of the kind in the English"
56,INTRODUCTION.,language.  Southey’s tale of Roderick himself was written at the same
57,INTRODUCTION.,"time when Walter Savage Landor was writing a play upon the subject, and"
58,INTRODUCTION.,"Scott was, in the piece here reprinted, making it the starting-point of a"
59,INTRODUCTION.,vision of the war in the Peninsula.  The fatal palace of Don Roderick may
60,INTRODUCTION.,have been a fable connected with the ruins of a Roman amphitheatre.  The
61,INTRODUCTION.,"fable, as translated by Scott from a Spanish History of King Roderick,"
62,INTRODUCTION.,was this:—
63,INTRODUCTION.,
64,INTRODUCTION.,"“One mile on the east side of the city of Toledo, among some rocks,"
65,INTRODUCTION.,"was situated an ancient Tower of magnificent structure, though much"
66,INTRODUCTION.,"dilapidated by time, which consumes all: four estadoes (_i.e._, four"
67,INTRODUCTION.,"times a man’s height) below it, there was a Cave with a very narrow"
68,INTRODUCTION.,"entrance, and a gate cut out of the solid rock, lined with a strong"
69,INTRODUCTION.,"covering of iron, and fastened with many locks; above the gate some"
70,INTRODUCTION.,"Greek letters are engraved, which, although abbreviated, and of"
71,INTRODUCTION.,"doubtful meaning, were thus interpreted, according to the exposition"
72,INTRODUCTION.,of learned men:—_The King who opens this cave and discovers the
73,INTRODUCTION.,wonders will discover both good and evil things_.  Many kings desired
74,INTRODUCTION.,"to know the mystery of this Tower, and sought to find out the manner"
75,INTRODUCTION.,"with much care; but when they opened the gate, such a tremendous"
76,INTRODUCTION.,noise arose in the Cave that it appeared as if the earth was
77,INTRODUCTION.,"bursting; many of those present sickened with fear, and others lost"
78,INTRODUCTION.,their lives.  In order to prevent such great perils (as they supposed
79,INTRODUCTION.,"a dangerous enchantment was contained within), they secured the gate"
80,INTRODUCTION.,"with new locks, concluding, that though a king was destined to open"
81,INTRODUCTION.,"it, the fated time was not yet arrived.  At last King Don Rodrigo,"
82,INTRODUCTION.,"led on by his evil fortune and unlucky destiny, opened the Tower; and"
83,INTRODUCTION.,"some bold attendants whom he had brought with him entered, although"
84,INTRODUCTION.,"agitated with fear.  Having proceeded a good way, they fled back to"
85,INTRODUCTION.,"the entrance, terrified with a frightful vision which they had"
86,INTRODUCTION.,"beheld.  The King was greatly moved, and ordered many torches, so"
87,INTRODUCTION.,"contrived that the tempest in the cave could not extinguish them, to"
88,INTRODUCTION.,"be lighted.  Then the King entered, not without fear, before all the"
89,INTRODUCTION.,"others.  He discovered, by degrees, a splendid hall, apparently built"
90,INTRODUCTION.,in a very sumptuous manner; in the middle stood a Bronze Statue of
91,INTRODUCTION.,"very ferocious appearance, which held a battle-axe in its hands."
92,INTRODUCTION.,"With this he struck the floor violently, giving it such heavy blows"
93,INTRODUCTION.,that the noise in the Cave was occasioned by the motion of the air.
94,INTRODUCTION.,"The King, greatly affrighted and astonished, began to conjure this"
95,INTRODUCTION.,"terrible vision, promising that he would return without doing any"
96,INTRODUCTION.,"injury in the Cave, after he had obtained sight of what was contained"
97,INTRODUCTION.,"in it.  The Statue ceased to strike the floor, and the King, with his"
98,INTRODUCTION.,"followers, somewhat assured, and recovering their courage, proceeded"
99,INTRODUCTION.,into the hall; and on the left of the Statue they found this
100,INTRODUCTION.,"inscription on the wall: _Unfortunate King_, _thou hast entered here"
101,INTRODUCTION.,in an evil hour_.  On the right side of the wall the words were
102,INTRODUCTION.,"inscribed: _By strange Nations thou shalt be dispossessed_, _and thy"
103,INTRODUCTION.,subjects foully degraded_.  On the shoulders of the Statue other
104,INTRODUCTION.,"words were written, which said, _I call upon __the Arabs_.  And upon"
105,INTRODUCTION.,"his heart was written, _I do my office_.  At the entrance of the hall"
106,INTRODUCTION.,"there was placed a round bowl, from which a great noise, like the"
107,INTRODUCTION.,"fall of waters, proceeded.  They found no other thing in the"
108,INTRODUCTION.,"hall,—and when the King, sorrowful and greatly affected, had scarcely"
109,INTRODUCTION.,"turned about to leave the Cavern, the Statue again commenced its"
110,INTRODUCTION.,accustomed blows upon the floor.  After they had mutually promised to
111,INTRODUCTION.,"conceal what they had seen, they again closed the Tower, and blocked"
112,INTRODUCTION.,"up the gate of the Cavern with earth, that no memory might remain in"
113,INTRODUCTION.,the world of such a portentous and evil-boding prodigy.  The ensuing
114,INTRODUCTION.,"midnight, they heard great cries and clamour from the Cave,"
115,INTRODUCTION.,"resounding like the noise of Battle, and the ground shaking with a"
116,INTRODUCTION.,tremendous roar; the whole edifice of the old Tower fell to the
117,INTRODUCTION.,"ground, by which they were greatly affrighted, the Vision which they"
118,INTRODUCTION.,had beheld appearing to them as a dream.”
119,INTRODUCTION.,
120,INTRODUCTION.,Scott’s poem on the Field of Waterloo was written to assist the Waterloo
121,INTRODUCTION.,subscription.

131,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
132,PREFACE.,
133,PREFACE.,
134,PREFACE.,"THE following Poem is founded upon a Spanish Tradition, bearing, in"
135,PREFACE.,"general, that Don Roderick, the last Gothic King of Spain, when the"
136,PREFACE.,"invasion of the Moors was depending, had the temerity to descend into an"
137,PREFACE.,"ancient vault, near Toledo, the opening of which had been denounced as"
138,PREFACE.,"fatal to the Spanish Monarchy.  The legend adds, that his rash curiosity"
139,PREFACE.,"was mortified by an emblematical representation of those Saracens who, in"
140,PREFACE.,"the year 714, defeated him in battle, and reduced Spain under their"
141,PREFACE.,dominion.  I have presumed to prolong the Vision of the Revolutions of
142,PREFACE.,"Spain down to the present eventful crisis of the Peninsula, and to divide"
143,PREFACE.,"it, by a supposed change of scene, into, THREE PERIODS.  The FIRST of"
144,PREFACE.,"these represents the Invasion of the Moors, the Defeat and Death of"
145,PREFACE.,"Roderick, and closes with the peaceful occupation of the country by the"
146,PREFACE.,victors.  The SECOND PERIOD embraces the state of the Peninsula when the
147,PREFACE.,conquests of the Spaniards and Portuguese in the East and West Indies had
148,PREFACE.,"raised to the highest pitch the renown of their arms; sullied, however,"
149,PREFACE.,by superstition and cruelty.  An allusion to the inhumanities of the
150,PREFACE.,Inquisition terminates this picture.  The LAST PART of the Poem opens
151,PREFACE.,with the state of Spain previous to the unparalleled treachery of
152,PREFACE.,"BUONAPARTE, gives a sketch of the usurpation attempted upon that"
153,PREFACE.,"unsuspicious and friendly kingdom, and terminates with the arrival of the"
154,PREFACE.,"British succours.  It may be further proper to mention, that the object"
155,PREFACE.,"of the Poem is less to commemorate or detail particular incidents, than"
156,PREFACE.,to exhibit a general and impressive picture of the several periods
157,PREFACE.,brought upon the stage.

170,I.,Or died it with yon Master of the Lyre
171,I.,Who sung beleaguered Ilion’s evil star?
172,I.,"Such, WELLINGTON, might reach thee from afar,"
173,I.,Wafting its descant wide o’er Ocean’s range;
174,I.,"Nor shouts, nor clashing arms, its mood could mar,"
175,I.,"All, as it swelled ’twixt each loud trumpet-change,"
176,I.,"That clangs to Britain victory, to Portugal revenge!"

178,II.,II.
179,II.,
180,II.,"Yes! such a strain, with all o’er-pouring measure,"
181,II.,Might melodise with each tumultuous sound
182,II.,"Each voice of fear or triumph, woe or pleasure,"
183,II.,That rings Mondego’s ravaged shores around;
184,II.,"The thundering cry of hosts with conquest crowned,"
185,II.,"The female shriek, the ruined peasant’s moan,"
186,II.,"The shout of captives from their chains unbound,"

193,III.,"Skilled but to imitate an elder page,"
194,III.,"Timid and raptureless, can we repay"
195,III.,The debt thou claim’st in this exhausted age?
196,III.,"Thou givest our lyres a theme, that might engage"
197,III.,"Those that could send thy name o’er sea and land,"
198,III.,While sea and land shall last; for Homer’s rage
199,III.,A theme; a theme for Milton’s mighty hand—

204,IV.,Ye mountains stern! within whose rugged breast
205,IV.,The friends of Scottish freedom found repose;

207,IV.,Returning from the field of vanquished foes;
208,IV.,"Say, have ye lost each wild majestic close"
209,IV.,"That erst the choir of Bards or Druids flung,"
210,IV.,"What time their hymn of victory arose,"
211,IV.,"And Cattraeth’s glens with voice of triumph rung,"
212,IV.,"And mystic Merlin harped, and grey-haired Llywarch sung?"

214,V.,V.
215,V.,
216,V.,"Oh! if your wilds such minstrelsy retain,"
217,V.,"As sure your changeful gales seem oft to say,"
218,V.,"When sweeping wild and sinking soft again,"
219,V.,"Like trumpet-jubilee, or harp’s wild sway;"
220,V.,"If ye can echo such triumphant lay,"
221,V.,Then lend the note to him has loved you long!
222,V.,Who pious gathered each tradition grey
223,V.,"That floats your solitary wastes along,"
224,V.,And with affection vain gave them new voice in song.

228,VI.,"For not till now, how oft soe’er the task"
229,VI.,"Of truant verse hath lightened graver care,"
230,VI.,"From Muse or Sylvan was he wont to ask,"
231,VI.,"In phrase poetic, inspiration fair;"
232,VI.,"Careless he gave his numbers to the air,"
233,VI.,"They came unsought for, if applauses came:"
234,VI.,Nor for himself prefers he now the prayer;
235,VI.,"Let but his verse befit a hero’s fame,"
236,VI.,Immortal be the verse!—forgot the poet’s name!

241,VII.,"“Minstrel! the fame of whose romantic lyre,"
242,VII.,"Capricious-swelling now, may soon be lost,"
243,VII.,Like the light flickering of a cottage fire;
244,VII.,"If to such task presumptuous thou aspire,"
245,VII.,Seek not from us the meed to warrior due:
246,VII.,Age after age has gathered son to sire

254,VIII.,"By milkmaid seen beneath the hawthorn hoar,"
255,VIII.,Or round the marge of Minchmore’s haunted spring;
256,VIII.,"Save where their legends grey-haired shepherds sing,"
257,VIII.,"That now scarce win a listening ear but thine,"
258,VIII.,"Of feuds obscure, and Border ravaging,"
259,VIII.,"And rugged deeds recount in rugged line,"

267,IX.,"In verse spontaneous chants some favoured name,"
268,IX.,"Whether Olalia’s charms his tribute claim,"

279,X.,Barbaric monuments of pomp repose;
280,X.,Or where the banners of more ruthless foes
281,X.,"Than the fierce Moor, float o’er Toledo’s fane,"
282,X.,From whose tall towers even now the patriot throws

292,XI.,"And, if the glow of feudal chivalry"

303,XII.,"Legend and vision, prophecy and sign;"
304,XII.,Where wonders wild of Arabesque combine
305,XII.,"With Gothic imagery of darker shade,"
306,XII.,Forming a model meet for minstrel line.

316,I.,
317,I.,"REARING their crests amid the cloudless skies,"
318,I.,"And darkly clustering in the pale moonlight,"
319,I.,"Toledo’s holy towers and spires arise,"
320,I.,As from a trembling lake of silver white.
321,I.,Their mingled shadows intercept the sight
322,I.,"Of the broad burial-ground outstretched below,"
323,I.,And nought disturbs the silence of the night;
324,I.,"All sleeps in sullen shade, or silver glow,"
325,I.,All save the heavy swell of Teio’s ceaseless flow.
326,I.,
327,II.,II.
328,II.,
329,II.,"All save the rushing swell of Teio’s tide,"
330,II.,"Or, distant heard, a courser’s neigh or tramp;"
331,II.,"Their changing rounds as watchful horsemen ride,"
332,II.,To guard the limits of King Roderick’s camp.
333,II.,For through the river’s night-fog rolling damp
334,II.,"Was many a proud pavilion dimly seen,"
335,II.,"Which glimmered back, against the moon’s fair lamp,"
336,II.,"Tissues of silk and silver twisted sheen,"
337,II.,"And standards proudly pitched, and warders armed between."
338,II.,
339,III.,III.
340,III.,
341,III.,"But of their Monarch’s person keeping ward,"
342,III.,"Since last the deep-mouthed bell of vespers tolled,"
343,III.,The chosen soldiers of the royal guard
344,III.,The post beneath the proud Cathedral hold:
345,III.,"A band unlike their Gothic sires of old,"
346,III.,"Who, for the cap of steel and iron mace,"
347,III.,"Bear slender darts, and casques bedecked with gold,"
348,III.,"While silver-studded belts their shoulders grace,"
349,III.,Where ivory quivers ring in the broad falchion’s place.
350,III.,
351,IV.,IV.
352,IV.,
353,IV.,"In the light language of an idle court,"
354,IV.,"They murmured at their master’s long delay,"
355,IV.,And held his lengthened orisons in sport:—
356,IV.,"“What! will Don Roderick here till morning stay,"
357,IV.,To wear in shrift and prayer the night away?
358,IV.,"And are his hours in such dull penance past,"
359,IV.,For fair Florinda’s plundered charms to pay?”
360,IV.,"Then to the east their weary eyes they cast,"
361,IV.,And wished the lingering dawn would glimmer forth at last.

363,V.,V.
364,V.,
365,V.,"But, far within, Toledo’s Prelate lent"
366,V.,An ear of fearful wonder to the King;
367,V.,"The silver lamp a fitful lustre sent,"
368,V.,So long that sad confession witnessing:
369,V.,"For Roderick told of many a hidden thing,"
370,V.,"Such as are lothly uttered to the air,"
371,V.,"When Fear, Remorse, and Shame the bosom wring,"
372,V.,"And Guilt his secret burden cannot bear,"

375,VI.,VI.
376,VI.,

378,VI.,The stream of failing light was feebly rolled:
379,VI.,"But Roderick’s visage, though his head was bare,"
380,VI.,Was shadowed by his hand and mantle’s fold.
381,VI.,"While of his hidden soul the sins he told,"
382,VI.,"Proud Alaric’s descendant could not brook,"
383,VI.,"That mortal man his bearing should behold,"

390,VII.,As many a secret sad the King bewrayed;
391,VII.,"As sign and glance eked out the unfinished tale,"
392,VII.,When in the midst his faltering whisper stayed.
393,VII.,"“Thus royal Witiza was slain,”—he said;"
394,VII.,"“Yet, holy Father, deem not it was I.”"
395,VII.,Thus still Ambition strives her crimes to shade.—

404,VIII.,"Yet, reverend Priest, thy sentence rash refrain!"
405,VIII.,All is not as it seems—the female train
406,VIII.,Know by their bearing to disguise their mood:”
407,VIII.,"But Conscience here, as if in high disdain,"
408,VIII.,Sent to the Monarch’s cheek the burning blood—
409,VIII.,He stayed his speech abrupt—and up the Prelate stood.
410,VIII.,
411,IX.,IX.
412,IX.,
413,IX.,“O hardened offspring of an iron race!
414,IX.,"What of thy crimes, Don Roderick, shall I say?"

417,IX.,"For the foul ravisher how shall I pray,"
418,IX.,"Who, scarce repentant, makes his crime his boast?"
419,IX.,"How hope Almighty vengeance shall delay,"

423,X.,X.
424,X.,
425,X.,"Then kindled the dark tyrant in his mood,"
426,X.,And to his brow returned its dauntless gloom;

429,X.,"Yet will I know whence come they, or by whom."
430,X.,"Show, for thou canst—give forth the fated key,"
431,X.,"And guide me, Priest, to that mysterious room,"

452,XII.,"By winding stair, dark aisle, and secret nook,"
453,XII.,Then on an ancient gateway bent his look;
454,XII.,"And, as the key the desperate King essayed,"
455,XII.,"Low muttered thunders the Cathedral shook,"
456,XII.,"And twice he stopped, and twice new effort made,"
457,XII.,"Till the huge bolts rolled back, and the loud hinges brayed."
458,XII.,
459,XIII.,XIII.
460,XIII.,
461,XIII.,"Long, large, and lofty was that vaulted hall;"
462,XIII.,"Roof, walls, and floor were all of marble stone,"
463,XIII.,"Of polished marble, black as funeral pall,"
464,XIII.,Carved o’er with signs and characters unknown.
465,XIII.,"A paly light, as of the dawning, shone"
466,XIII.,"Through the sad bounds, but whence they could not spy;"
467,XIII.,For window to the upper air was none;
468,XIII.,"Yet, by that light, Don Roderick could descry"
469,XIII.,Wonders that ne’er till then were seen by mortal eye.
470,XIII.,
471,XIV.,XIV.
472,XIV.,
473,XIV.,"Grim sentinels, against the upper wall,"
474,XIV.,"Of molten bronze, two Statues held their place;"
475,XIV.,"Massive their naked limbs, their stature tall,"
476,XIV.,Their frowning foreheads golden circles grace.
477,XIV.,"Moulded they seemed for kings of giant race,"
478,XIV.,That lived and sinned before the avenging flood;
479,XIV.,"This grasped a scythe, that rested on a mace;"
480,XIV.,"This spread his wings for flight, that pondering stood,"
481,XIV.,"Each stubborn seemed and stern, immutable of mood."
482,XIV.,
483,XV.,XV.
484,XV.,
485,XV.,Fixed was the right-hand Giant’s brazen look
486,XV.,"Upon his brother’s glass of shifting sand,"
487,XV.,"As if its ebb he measured by a book,"
488,XV.,Whose iron volume loaded his huge hand;
489,XV.,In which was wrote of many a fallen land
490,XV.,"Of empires lost, and kings to exile driven:"
491,XV.,And o’er that pair their names in scroll expand—
492,XV.,"“Lo, DESTINY and TIME! to whom by Heaven"
493,XV.,The guidance of the earth is for a season given.”—
494,XV.,
495,XVI.,XVI.
496,XVI.,
497,XVI.,"Even while they read, the sand-glass wastes away;"
498,XVI.,"And, as the last and lagging grains did creep,"
499,XVI.,"That right-hand Giant ’gan his club upsway,"
500,XVI.,As one that startles from a heavy sleep.
501,XVI.,Full on the upper wall the mace’s sweep
502,XVI.,"At once descended with the force of thunder,"
503,XVI.,"And hurtling down at once, in crumbled heap,"
504,XVI.,"The marble boundary was rent asunder,"
505,XVI.,And gave to Roderick’s view new sights of fear and wonder.
506,XVI.,
507,XVII.,XVII.
508,XVII.,
509,XVII.,"For they might spy, beyond that mighty breach,"
510,XVII.,"Realms as of Spain in visioned prospect laid,"
511,XVII.,"Castles and towers, in due proportion each,"
512,XVII.,As by some skilful artist’s hand portrayed:
513,XVII.,"Here, crossed by many a wild Sierra’s shade,"
514,XVII.,And boundless plains that tire the traveller’s eye;
515,XVII.,"There, rich with vineyard and with olive glade,"
516,XVII.,"Or deep-embrowned by forests huge and high,"
517,XVII.,"Or washed by mighty streams, that slowly murmured by."
518,XVII.,
519,XVIII.,XVIII.
520,XVIII.,
521,XVIII.,"And here, as erst upon the antique stage"
522,XVIII.,"Passed forth the band of masquers trimly led,"
523,XVIII.,"In various forms, and various equipage,"
524,XVIII.,While fitting strains the hearer’s fancy fed;
525,XVIII.,"So, to sad Roderick’s eye in order spread,"
526,XVIII.,"Successive pageants filled that mystic scene,"
527,XVIII.,"Showing the fate of battles ere they bled,"
528,XVIII.,And issue of events that had not been;
529,XVIII.,"And, ever and anon, strange sounds were heard between."
530,XVIII.,
531,XIX.,XIX.
532,XIX.,
533,XIX.,First shrilled an unrepeated female shriek!—
534,XIX.,"It seemed as if Don Roderick knew the call,"
535,XIX.,For the bold blood was blanching in his cheek.—
536,XIX.,"Then answered kettle-drum and attabal,"
537,XIX.,"Gong-peal and cymbal-clank the ear appal,"
538,XIX.,"The Tecbir war-cry, and the Lelie’s yell,"
539,XIX.,Ring wildly dissonant along the hall.
540,XIX.,Needs not to Roderick their dread import tell—
541,XIX.,"“The Moor!” he cried, “the Moor!—ring out the Tocsin bell!"
542,XIX.,
543,XX.,XX.
544,XX.,
545,XX.,“They come! they come!  I see the groaning lands
546,XX.,White with the turbans of each Arab horde;
547,XX.,"Swart Zaarah joins her misbelieving bands,"
548,XX.,"Alla and Mahomet their battle-word,"
549,XX.,"The choice they yield, the Koran or the Sword—"
550,XX.,See how the Christians rush to arms amain!—
551,XX.,"In yonder shout the voice of conflict roared,"
552,XX.,The shadowy hosts are closing on the plain—
553,XX.,"Now, God and Saint Iago strike, for the good cause of Spain!"
554,XX.,
555,XXI.,XXI.
556,XXI.,
557,XXI.,"“By Heaven, the Moors prevail! the Christians yield!"
558,XXI.,Their coward leader gives for flight the sign!
559,XXI.,The sceptred craven mounts to quit the field—
560,XXI.,"Is not yon steed Orelio?—Yes, ’tis mine!"
561,XXI.,But never was she turned from battle-line:
562,XXI.,Lo! where the recreant spurs o’er stock and stone!—
563,XXI.,"Curses pursue the slave, and wrath divine!"
564,XXI.,"Rivers ingulph him!”—“Hush,” in shuddering tone,"
565,XXI.,"The Prelate said; “rash Prince, yon visioned form’s thine own.”"
566,XXI.,
567,XXII.,XXII.
568,XXII.,
569,XXII.,"Just then, a torrent crossed the flier’s course;"
570,XXII.,The dangerous ford the Kingly Likeness tried;
571,XXII.,"But the deep eddies whelmed both man and horse,"
572,XXII.,Swept like benighted peasant down the tide;
573,XXII.,"And the proud Moslemah spread far and wide,"
574,XXII.,As numerous as their native locust band;
575,XXII.,"Berber and Ismael’s sons the spoils divide,"
576,XXII.,"With naked scimitars mete out the land,"
577,XXII.,And for the bondsmen base the free-born natives brand.
578,XXII.,
579,XXIII.,XXIII.
580,XXIII.,
581,XXIII.,"Then rose the grated Harem, to enclose"
582,XXIII.,The loveliest maidens of the Christian line;
583,XXIII.,"Then, menials, to their misbelieving foes,"
584,XXIII.,Castile’s young nobles held forbidden wine;
585,XXIII.,"Then, too, the holy Cross, salvation’s sign,"
586,XXIII.,"By impious hands was from the altar thrown,"
587,XXIII.,And the deep aisles of the polluted shrine
588,XXIII.,"Echoed, for holy hymn and organ-tone,"
589,XXIII.,"The Santon’s frantic dance, the Fakir’s gibbering moan."
590,XXIII.,
591,XXIV.,XXIV.
592,XXIV.,
593,XXIV.,How fares Don Roderick?—E’en as one who spies
594,XXIV.,"Flames dart their glare o’er midnight’s sable woof,"
595,XXIV.,"And hears around his children’s piercing cries,"
596,XXIV.,And sees the pale assistants stand aloof;
597,XXIV.,"While cruel Conscience brings him bitter proof,"
598,XXIV.,"His folly, or his crime, have caused his grief;"
599,XXIV.,"And while above him nods the crumbling roof,"
600,XXIV.,He curses earth and Heaven—himself in chief—
601,XXIV.,"Desperate of earthly aid, despairing Heaven’s relief!"
602,XXIV.,
603,XXV.,XXV.
604,XXV.,
605,XXV.,That scythe-armed Giant turned his fatal glass
606,XXV.,And twilight on the landscape closed her wings;
607,XXV.,"Far to Asturian hills the war-sounds pass,"
608,XXV.,And in their stead rebeck or timbrel rings;
609,XXV.,"And to the sound the bell-decked dancer springs,"
610,XXV.,"Bazars resound as when their marts are met,"
611,XXV.,"In tourney light the Moor his jerrid flings,"
612,XXV.,"And on the land as evening seemed to set,"
613,XXV.,The Imaum’s chant was heard from mosque or minaret.
614,XXV.,
615,XXVI.,XXVI.
616,XXVI.,
617,XXVI.,"So passed that pageant.  Ere another came,"
618,XXVI.,The visionary scene was wrapped in smoke
619,XXVI.,Whose sulph’rous wreaths were crossed by sheets of flame;
620,XXVI.,"With every flash a bolt explosive broke,"
621,XXVI.,"Till Roderick deemed the fiends had burst their yoke,"
622,XXVI.,And waved ’gainst heaven the infernal gonfalone!
623,XXVI.,"For War a new and dreadful language spoke,"
624,XXVI.,Never by ancient warrior heard or known;
625,XXVI.,"Lightning and smoke her breath, and thunder was her tone."
626,XXVI.,
627,XXVII.,XXVII.
628,XXVII.,
629,XXVII.,From the dim landscape rolled the clouds away—
630,XXVII.,The Christians have regained their heritage;
631,XXVII.,"Before the Cross has waned the Crescent’s ray,"
632,XXVII.,"And many a monastery decks the stage,"
633,XXVII.,"And lofty church, and low-browed hermitage."
634,XXVII.,"The land obeys a Hermit and a Knight,—"
635,XXVII.,The Genii those of Spain for many an age;
636,XXVII.,"This clad in sackcloth, that in armour bright,"
637,XXVII.,"And that was VALOUR named, this BIGOTRY was hight."
638,XXVII.,
639,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
640,XXVIII.,
641,XXVIII.,"VALOUR was harnessed like a chief of old,"
642,XXVIII.,"Armed at all points, and prompt for knightly gest;"
643,XXVIII.,"His sword was tempered in the Ebro cold,"
644,XXVIII.,"Morena’s eagle plume adorned his crest,"
645,XXVIII.,The spoils of Afric’s lion bound his breast.
646,XXVIII.,Fierce he stepped forward and flung down his gage;
647,XXVIII.,As if of mortal kind to brave the best.
648,XXVIII.,"Him followed his Companion, dark and sage,"
649,XXVIII.,"As he, my Master, sung the dangerous Archimage."
650,XXVIII.,
651,XXIX.,XXIX.
652,XXIX.,
653,XXIX.,"Haughty of heart and brow the Warrior came,"
654,XXIX.,"In look and language proud as proud might be,"
655,XXIX.,"Vaunting his lordship, lineage, fights, and fame:"
656,XXIX.,Yet was that barefoot Monk more proud than he:
657,XXIX.,"And as the ivy climbs the tallest tree,"
658,XXIX.,"So round the loftiest soul his toils he wound,"
659,XXIX.,"And with his spells subdued the fierce and free,"
660,XXIX.,"Till ermined Age and Youth in arms renowned,"
661,XXIX.,"Honouring his scourge and haircloth, meekly kissed the ground."
662,XXIX.,
663,XXX.,XXX.
664,XXX.,
665,XXX.,"And thus it chanced that VALOUR, peerless knight,"
666,XXX.,"Who ne’er to King or Kaiser vailed his crest,"
667,XXX.,"Victorious still in bull-feast or in fight,"
668,XXX.,"Since first his limbs with mail he did invest,"
669,XXX.,Stooped ever to that Anchoret’s behest;
670,XXX.,"Nor reasoned of the right, nor of the wrong,"
671,XXX.,"But at his bidding laid the lance in rest,"
672,XXX.,"And wrought fell deeds the troubled world along,"
673,XXX.,"For he was fierce as brave, and pitiless as strong."
674,XXX.,
675,XXXI.,XXXI.
676,XXXI.,
677,XXXI.,"Oft his proud galleys sought some new-found world,"
678,XXXI.,"That latest sees the sun, or first the morn;"
679,XXXI.,"Still at that Wizard’s feet their spoils he hurled,—"
680,XXXI.,"Ingots of ore from rich Potosi borne,"
681,XXXI.,"Crowns by Caciques, aigrettes by Omrahs worn,"
682,XXXI.,"Wrought of rare gems, but broken, rent, and foul;"
683,XXXI.,"Idols of gold from heathen temples torn,"
684,XXXI.,Bedabbled all with blood.—With grisly scowl
685,XXXI.,"The Hermit marked the stains, and smiled beneath his cowl."
686,XXXI.,
687,XXXII.,XXXII.
688,XXXII.,
689,XXXII.,"Then did he bless the offering, and bade make"
690,XXXII.,Tribute to Heaven of gratitude and praise;
691,XXXII.,"And at his word the choral hymns awake,"
692,XXXII.,"And many a hand the silver censer sways,"
693,XXXII.,"But with the incense-breath these censers raise,"
694,XXXII.,Mix steams from corpses smouldering in the fire;
695,XXXII.,"The groans of prisoned victims mar the lays,"
696,XXXII.,And shrieks of agony confound the quire;
697,XXXII.,"While, ’mid the mingled sounds, the darkened scenes expire."
698,XXXII.,
699,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
700,XXXIII.,
701,XXXIII.,"Preluding light, were strains of music heard,"
702,XXXIII.,As once again revolved that measured sand;
703,XXXIII.,"Such sounds as when, for silvan dance prepared,"
704,XXXIII.,Gay Xeres summons forth her vintage band;
705,XXXIII.,When for the light bolero ready stand
706,XXXIII.,"The mozo blithe, with gay muchacha met,"
707,XXXIII.,"He conscious of his broidered cap and band,"
708,XXXIII.,"She of her netted locks and light corsette,"
709,XXXIII.,"Each tiptoe perched to spring, and shake the castanet."
710,XXXIII.,
711,XXXIV.,XXXIV.
712,XXXIV.,
713,XXXIV.,And well such strains the opening scene became;
714,XXXIV.,"For VALOUR had relaxed his ardent look,"
715,XXXIV.,"And at a lady’s feet, like lion tame,"
716,XXXIV.,"Lay stretched, full loath the weight of arms to brook;"
717,XXXIV.,"And softened BIGOTRY, upon his book,"
718,XXXIV.,Pattered a task of little good or ill:
719,XXXIV.,"But the blithe peasant plied his pruning-hook,"
720,XXXIV.,"Whistled the muleteer o’er vale and hill,"
721,XXXIV.,And rung from village-green the merry seguidille.
722,XXXIV.,
723,XXXV.,XXXV.
724,XXXV.,
725,XXXV.,"Grey Royalty, grown impotent of toil,"
726,XXXV.,Let the grave sceptre slip his lazy hold;
727,XXXV.,"And, careless, saw his rule become the spoil"
728,XXXV.,Of a loose Female and her minion bold.
729,XXXV.,"But peace was on the cottage and the fold,"
730,XXXV.,"From Court intrigue, from bickering faction far;"
731,XXXV.,"Beneath the chestnut-tree Love’s tale was told,"
732,XXXV.,"And to the tinkling of the light guitar,"
733,XXXV.,"Sweet stooped the western sun, sweet rose the evening star."
734,XXXV.,
735,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
736,XXXVI.,
737,XXXVI.,"As that sea-cloud, in size like human hand,"
738,XXXVI.,"When first from Carmel by the Tishbite seen,"
739,XXXVI.,"Came slowly overshadowing Israel’s land,"
740,XXXVI.,"A while, perchance, bedecked with colours sheen,"
741,XXXVI.,"While yet the sunbeams on its skirts had been,"
742,XXXVI.,"Limning with purple and with gold its shroud,"
743,XXXVI.,Till darker folds obscured the blue serene
744,XXXVI.,"And blotted heaven with one broad sable cloud,"
745,XXXVI.,"Then sheeted rain burst down, and whirlwinds howled aloud:—"
746,XXXVI.,
747,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
748,XXXVII.,
749,XXXVII.,"Even so, upon that peaceful scene was poured,"
750,XXXVII.,"Like gathering clouds, full many a foreign band,"
751,XXXVII.,"And HE, their Leader, wore in sheath his sword,"
752,XXXVII.,"And offered peaceful front and open hand,"
753,XXXVII.,"Veiling the perjured treachery he planned,"
754,XXXVII.,"By friendship’s zeal and honour’s specious guise,"
755,XXXVII.,Until he won the passes of the land;
756,XXXVII.,Then burst were honour’s oath and friendship’s ties!
757,XXXVII.,"He clutched his vulture grasp, and called fair Spain his prize."
758,XXXVII.,
759,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
760,XXXVIII.,
761,XXXVIII.,An iron crown his anxious forehead bore;
762,XXXVIII.,"And well such diadem his heart became,"
763,XXXVIII.,"Who ne’er his purpose for remorse gave o’er,"
764,XXXVIII.,Or checked his course for piety or shame;
765,XXXVIII.,"Who, trained a soldier, deemed a soldier’s fame"
766,XXXVIII.,"Might flourish in the wreath of battles won,"
767,XXXVIII.,Though neither truth nor honour decked his name;
768,XXXVIII.,"Who, placed by fortune on a Monarch’s throne,"
769,XXXVIII.,"Recked not of Monarch’s faith, or Mercy’s kingly tone."
770,XXXVIII.,
771,XXXIX.,XXXIX.
772,XXXIX.,
773,XXXIX.,"From a rude isle his ruder lineage came,"
774,XXXIX.,"The spark, that, from a suburb-hovel’s hearth"
775,XXXIX.,"Ascending, wraps some capital in flame,"
776,XXXIX.,Hath not a meaner or more sordid birth.
777,XXXIX.,And for the soul that bade him waste the earth—
778,XXXIX.,The sable land-flood from some swamp obscure
779,XXXIX.,"That poisons the glad husband-field with dearth,"
780,XXXIX.,"And by destruction bids its fame endure,"
781,XXXIX.,"Hath not a source more sullen, stagnant, and impure."
782,XXXIX.,
783,XL.,XL.
784,XL.,
785,XL.,Before that Leader strode a shadowy Form;
786,XL.,"Her limbs like mist, her torch like meteor showed,"
787,XL.,"With which she beckoned him through fight and storm,"
788,XL.,"And all he crushed that crossed his desperate road,"
789,XL.,"Nor thought, nor feared, nor looked on what he trode."
790,XL.,"Realms could not glut his pride, blood could not slake,"
791,XL.,So oft as e’er she shook her torch abroad—
792,XL.,"It was AMBITION bade her terrors wake,"
793,XL.,"Nor deigned she, as of yore, a milder form to take."
794,XL.,
795,XLI.,XLI.
796,XLI.,
797,XLI.,"No longer now she spurned at mean revenge,"
798,XLI.,Or stayed her hand for conquered foeman’s moan;
799,XLI.,"As when, the fates of aged Rome to change,"
800,XLI.,By Cæsar’s side she crossed the Rubicon.
801,XLI.,"Nor joyed she to bestow the spoils she won,"
802,XLI.,As when the banded powers of Greece were tasked
803,XLI.,To war beneath the Youth of Macedon:
804,XLI.,"No seemly veil her modern minion asked,"
805,XLI.,"He saw her hideous face, and loved the fiend unmasked."
806,XLI.,
807,XLII.,XLII.
808,XLII.,
809,XLII.,That Prelate marked his march—On banners blazed
810,XLII.,"With battles won in many a distant land,"
811,XLII.,On eagle-standards and on arms he gazed;
812,XLII.,"“And hopest thou, then,” he said, “thy power shall stand?"
813,XLII.,"Oh! thou hast builded on the shifting sand,"
814,XLII.,And thou hast tempered it with slaughter’s flood;
815,XLII.,"And know, fell scourge in the Almighty’s hand,"
816,XLII.,"Gore-moistened trees shall perish in the bud,"
817,XLII.,And by a bloody death shall die the Man of Blood!”
818,XLII.,
819,XLIII.,XLIII.
820,XLIII.,
821,XLIII.,The ruthless Leader beckoned from his train
822,XLIII.,"A wan fraternal Shade, and bade him kneel,"
823,XLIII.,"And paled his temples with the crown of Spain,"
824,XLIII.,"While trumpets rang, and heralds cried “Castile!”"
825,XLIII.,"Not that he loved him—No!—In no man’s weal,"
826,XLIII.,"Scarce in his own, e’er joyed that sullen heart;"
827,XLIII.,"Yet round that throne he bade his warriors wheel,"
828,XLIII.,"That the poor puppet might perform his part,"
829,XLIII.,"And be a sceptred slave, at his stern beck to start."
830,XLIII.,
831,XLIV.,XLIV.
832,XLIV.,
833,XLIV.,"But on the Natives of that Land misused,"
834,XLIV.,"Not long the silence of amazement hung,"
835,XLIV.,Nor brooked they long their friendly faith abused;
836,XLIV.,"For, with a common shriek, the general tongue"
837,XLIV.,"Exclaimed, “To arms!”—and fast to arms they sprung."
838,XLIV.,"And VALOUR woke, that Genius of the Land!"
839,XLIV.,"Pleasure, and ease, and sloth aside he flung,"
840,XLIV.,"As burst the awakening Nazarite his band,"
841,XLIV.,When ’gainst his treacherous foes he clenched his dreadful hand.
842,XLIV.,
843,XLV.,XLV.
844,XLV.,
845,XLV.,That Mimic Monarch now cast anxious eye
846,XLV.,"Upon the Satraps that begirt him round,"
847,XLV.,"Now doffed his royal robe in act to fly,"
848,XLV.,And from his brow the diadem unbound.
849,XLV.,"So oft, so near, the Patriot bugle wound,"
850,XLV.,"From Tarik’s walls to Bilboa’s mountains blown,"
851,XLV.,These martial satellites hard labour found
852,XLV.,To guard awhile his substituted throne—
853,XLV.,"Light recking of his cause, but battling for their own."
854,XLV.,
855,XLVI.,XLVI.
856,XLVI.,
857,XLVI.,"From Alpuhara’s peak that bugle rung,"
858,XLVI.,And it was echoed from Corunna’s wall;
859,XLVI.,"Stately Seville responsive war-shot flung,"
860,XLVI.,Grenada caught it in her Moorish hall;
861,XLVI.,"Galicia bade her children fight or fall,"
862,XLVI.,"Wild Biscay shook his mountain-coronet,"
863,XLVI.,"Valencia roused her at the battle-call,"
864,XLVI.,"And, foremost still where Valour’s sons are met,"
865,XLVI.,First started to his gun each fiery Miquelet.
866,XLVI.,
867,XLVII.,XLVII.
868,XLVII.,
869,XLVII.,"But unappalled, and burning for the fight,"
870,XLVII.,"The Invaders march, of victory secure;"
871,XLVII.,"Skilful their force to sever or unite,"
872,XLVII.,And trained alike to vanquish or endure.
873,XLVII.,"Nor skilful less, cheap conquest to ensure,"
874,XLVII.,"Discord to breathe, and jealousy to sow,"
875,XLVII.,"To quell by boasting, and by bribes to lure;"
876,XLVII.,"While nought against them bring the unpractised foe,"

881,XLVIII.,"Proudly they march—but, oh! they march not forth"

883,XLVIII.,"As when their Eagles, sweeping through the North,"
884,XLVIII.,Destroyed at every stoop an ancient reign!
885,XLVIII.,Far other fate had Heaven decreed for Spain;
886,XLVIII.,"In vain the steel, in vain the torch was plied,"
887,XLVIII.,"New Patriot armies started from the slain,"
888,XLVIII.,"High blazed the war, and long, and far, and wide,"

896,XLIX.,"But, with the darkness, the Guerilla band"
897,XLIX.,"Came like night’s tempest, and avenged the land,"
898,XLIX.,"And claimed for blood the retribution due,"
899,XLIX.,"Probed the hard heart, and lopped the murd’rous hand;"

1354,III.,Crests the soft hill whose long smooth ridge
1355,III.,"Looks on the field below,"
1356,III.,And sinks so gently on the dale
1357,III.,That not the folds of Beauty’s veil
1358,III.,In easier curves can flow.
1359,III.,"Brief space from thence, the ground again"
1360,III.,Ascending slowly from the plain
1361,III.,"Forms an opposing screen,"
1362,III.,"Which, with its crest of upland ground,"
1363,III.,Shuts the horizon all around.
1364,III.,The softened vale between
1365,III.,Slopes smooth and fair for courser’s tread;
1366,III.,Not the most timid maid need dread
1367,III.,To give her snow-white palfrey head
1368,III.,On that wide stubble-ground;
1369,III.,"Nor wood, nor tree, nor bush are there,"
1370,III.,"Her course to intercept or scare,"
1371,III.,"Nor fosse nor fence are found,"
1372,III.,"Save where, from out her shattered bowers,"
1373,III.,Rise Hougomont’s dismantled towers.
1374,III.,
1375,IV.,IV.
1376,IV.,
1377,IV.,"Now, see’st thou aught in this lone scene"
1378,IV.,Can tell of that which late hath been?—
1379,IV.,"A stranger might reply,"
1380,IV.,“The bare extent of stubble-plain
1381,IV.,Seems lately lightened of its grain;
1382,IV.,And yonder sable tracks remain
1383,IV.,"Marks of the peasant’s ponderous wain,"
1384,IV.,When harvest-home was nigh.
1385,IV.,"On these broad spots of trampled ground,"
1386,IV.,Perchance the rustics danced such round
1387,IV.,As Teniers loved to draw;
1388,IV.,"And where the earth seems scorched by flame,"
1389,IV.,"To dress the homely feast they came,"
1390,IV.,And toiled the kerchiefed village dame
1391,IV.,Around her fire of straw.”
1392,IV.,
1393,V.,V.
1394,V.,
1395,V.,"So deem’st thou—so each mortal deems,"
1396,V.,Of that which is from that which seems:—
1397,V.,But other harvest here
1398,V.,"Than that which peasant’s scythe demands,"
1399,V.,"Was gathered in by sterner hands,"
1400,V.,"With bayonet, blade, and spear."
1401,V.,"No vulgar crop was theirs to reap,"
1402,V.,No stinted harvest thin and cheap!
1403,V.,Heroes before each fatal sweep
1404,V.,Fell thick as ripened grain;
1405,V.,"And ere the darkening of the day,"
1406,V.,"Piled high as autumn shocks, there lay"
1407,V.,"The ghastly harvest of the fray,"
1408,V.,The corpses of the slain.
1409,V.,
1410,VI.,VI.
1411,VI.,
1412,VI.,"Ay, look again—that line, so black"
1413,VI.,"And trampled, marks the bivouac,"
1414,VI.,"Yon deep-graved ruts the artillery’s track,"
1415,VI.,So often lost and won;
1416,VI.,"And close beside, the hardened mud"
1417,VI.,"Still shows where, fetlock-deep in blood,"
1418,VI.,"The fierce dragoon, through battle’s flood,"
1419,VI.,Dashed the hot war-horse on.
1420,VI.,These spots of excavation tell
1421,VI.,The ravage of the bursting shell—
1422,VI.,"And feel’st thou not the tainted steam,"
1423,VI.,"That reeks against the sultry beam,"
1424,VI.,From yonder trenchéd mound?
1425,VI.,The pestilential fumes declare
1426,VI.,That Carnage has replenished there
1427,VI.,Her garner-house profound.
1428,VI.,
1429,VII.,VII.
1430,VII.,
1431,VII.,"Far other harvest-home and feast,"
1432,VII.,"Than claims the boor from scythe released,"
1433,VII.,On these scorched fields were known!
1434,VII.,"Death hovered o’er the maddening rout,"
1435,VII.,"And, in the thrilling battle-shout,"
1436,VII.,Sent for the bloody banquet out
1437,VII.,A summons of his own.
1438,VII.,Through rolling smoke the Demon’s eye
1439,VII.,"Could well each destined guest espy,"
1440,VII.,Well could his ear in ecstasy
1441,VII.,Distinguish every tone
1442,VII.,That filled the chorus of the fray—
1443,VII.,"From cannon-roar and trumpet-bray,"
1444,VII.,"From charging squadrons’ wild hurra,"
1445,VII.,"From the wild clang that marked their way,—"
1446,VII.,"Down to the dying groan,"
1447,VII.,"And the last sob of life’s decay,"
1448,VII.,When breath was all but flown.
1449,VII.,
1450,VIII.,VIII.
1451,VIII.,
1452,VIII.,"Feast on, stern foe of mortal life,"
1453,VIII.,"Feast on!—but think not that a strife,"
1454,VIII.,"With such promiscuous carnage rife,"
1455,VIII.,Protracted space may last;
1456,VIII.,The deadly tug of war at length
1457,VIII.,"Must limits find in human strength,"
1458,VIII.,And cease when these are past.
1459,VIII.,Vain hope!—that morn’s o’erclouded sun
1460,VIII.,Heard the wild shout of fight begun
1461,VIII.,"Ere he attained his height,"
1462,VIII.,"And through the war-smoke, volumed high,"
1463,VIII.,"Still peals that unremitted cry,"
1464,VIII.,Though now he stoops to night.
1465,VIII.,"For ten long hours of doubt and dread,"
1466,VIII.,Fresh succours from the extended head
1467,VIII.,Of either hill the contest fed;
1468,VIII.,"Still down the slope they drew,"
1469,VIII.,"The charge of columns pauséd not,"
1470,VIII.,Nor ceased the storm of shell and shot;
1471,VIII.,For all that war could do
1472,VIII.,"Of skill and force was proved that day,"
1473,VIII.,And turned not yet the doubtful fray
1474,VIII.,On bloody Waterloo.
1475,VIII.,
1476,IX.,IX.
1477,IX.,
1478,IX.,"Pale Brussels! then what thoughts were thine,"
1479,IX.,When ceaseless from the distant line
1480,IX.,Continued thunders came!
1481,IX.,"Each burgher held his breath, to hear"
1482,IX.,"These forerunners of havoc near,"
1483,IX.,Of rapine and of flame.
1484,IX.,"What ghastly sights were thine to meet,"
1485,IX.,"When rolling through thy stately street,"
1486,IX.,The wounded showed their mangled plight
1487,IX.,"In token of the unfinished fight,"
1488,IX.,And from each anguish-laden wain
1489,IX.,The blood-drops laid thy dust like rain!
1490,IX.,How often in the distant drum
1491,IX.,"Heard’st thou the fell Invader come,"
1492,IX.,"While Ruin, shouting to his band,"
1493,IX.,Shook high her torch and gory brand!—
1494,IX.,"Cheer thee, fair City!  From yon stand,"
1495,IX.,"Impatient, still his outstretched hand"
1496,IX.,"Points to his prey in vain,"
1497,IX.,"While maddening in his eager mood,"
1498,IX.,"And all unwont to be withstood,"
1499,IX.,He fires the fight again.
1500,IX.,
1501,X.,X.
1502,X.,
1503,X.,“On! On!” was still his stern exclaim;
1504,X.,“Confront the battery’s jaws of flame!
1505,X.,Rush on the levelled gun!
1506,X.,"My steel-clad cuirassiers, advance!"
1507,X.,"Each Hulan forward with his lance,"
1508,X.,"My Guard—my Chosen—charge for France,"
1509,X.,France and Napoleon!”
1510,X.,"Loud answered their acclaiming shout,"
1511,X.,Greeting the mandate which sent out
1512,X.,Their bravest and their best to dare
1513,X.,The fate their leader shunned to share.
1514,X.,"But HE, his country’s sword and shield,"
1515,X.,"Still in the battle-front revealed,"
1516,X.,"Where danger fiercest swept the field,"
1517,X.,"Came like a beam of light,"
1518,X.,"In action prompt, in sentence brief—"
1519,X.,"“Soldiers, stand firm!” exclaimed the Chief,"
1520,X.,“England shall tell the fight!”
1521,X.,
1522,XI.,XI.
1523,XI.,
1524,XI.,On came the whirlwind—like the last
1525,XI.,But fiercest sweep of tempest-blast—
1526,XI.,On came the whirlwind—steel-gleams broke
1527,XI.,Like lightning through the rolling smoke;
1528,XI.,"The war was waked anew,"
1529,XI.,"Three hundred cannon-mouths roared loud,"
1530,XI.,"And from their throats, with flash and cloud,"
1531,XI.,Their showers of iron threw.
1532,XI.,"Beneath their fire, in full career,"
1533,XI.,"Rushed on the ponderous cuirassier,"
1534,XI.,"The lancer couched his ruthless spear,"
1535,XI.,"And hurrying as to havoc near,"
1536,XI.,The cohorts’ eagles flew.
1537,XI.,"In one dark torrent, broad and strong,"
1538,XI.,"The advancing onset rolled along,"
1539,XI.,"Forth harbingered by fierce acclaim,"
1540,XI.,"That, from the shroud of smoke and flame,"
1541,XI.,Pealed wildly the imperial name.
1542,XI.,
1543,XII.,XII.
1544,XII.,
1545,XII.,But on the British heart were lost
1546,XII.,The terrors of the charging host;
1547,XII.,For not an eye the storm that viewed
1548,XII.,"Changed its proud glance of fortitude,"
1549,XII.,"Nor was one forward footstep stayed,"
1550,XII.,As dropped the dying and the dead.
1551,XII.,"Fast as their ranks the thunders tear,"
1552,XII.,Fast they renewed each serried square;
1553,XII.,And on the wounded and the slain
1554,XII.,"Closed their diminished files again,"
1555,XII.,"Till from their line scarce spears’-lengths three,"
1556,XII.,Emerging from the smoke they see
1557,XII.,"Helmet, and plume, and panoply,—"
1558,XII.,Then waked their fire at once!
1559,XII.,"Each musketeer’s revolving knell,"
1560,XII.,"As fast, as regularly fell,"
1561,XII.,As when they practise to display
1562,XII.,Their discipline on festal day.
1563,XII.,"Then down went helm and lance,"
1564,XII.,"Down were the eagle banners sent,"
1565,XII.,"Down reeling steeds and riders went,"
1566,XII.,"Corslets were pierced, and pennons rent;"
1567,XII.,"And, to augment the fray,"
1568,XII.,"Wheeled full against their staggering flanks,"
1569,XII.,The English horsemen’s foaming ranks
1570,XII.,Forced their resistless way.
1571,XII.,Then to the musket-knell succeeds
1572,XII.,The clash of swords—the neigh of steeds—
1573,XII.,"As plies the smith his clanging trade,"
1574,XII.,Against the cuirass rang the blade;
1575,XII.,And while amid their close array
1576,XII.,"The well-served cannon rent their way,"
1577,XII.,And while amid their scattered band
1578,XII.,"Raged the fierce rider’s bloody brand,"
1579,XII.,"Recoiled in common rout and fear,"
1580,XII.,"Lancer and guard and cuirassier,"
1581,XII.,"Horsemen and foot,—a mingled host"
1582,XII.,"Their leaders fall’n, their standards lost."
1583,XII.,
1584,XIII.,XIII.
1585,XIII.,
1586,XIII.,"Then, WELLINGTON! thy piercing eye"
1587,XIII.,This crisis caught of destiny—
1588,XIII.,The British host had stood
1589,XIII.,That morn ’gainst charge of sword and lance
1590,XIII.,"As their own ocean-rocks hold stance,"
1591,XIII.,"But when thy voice had said, “Advance!”"
1592,XIII.,They were their ocean’s flood.—
1593,XIII.,"O Thou, whose inauspicious aim"
1594,XIII.,"Hath wrought thy host this hour of shame,"
1595,XIII.,Think’st thou thy broken bands will bide
1596,XIII.,The terrors of yon rushing tide?
1597,XIII.,Or will thy chosen brook to feel
1598,XIII.,"The British shock of levelled steel,"
1599,XIII.,Or dost thou turn thine eye
1600,XIII.,"Where coming squadrons gleam afar,"
1601,XIII.,"And fresher thunders wake the war,"
1602,XIII.,And other standards fly?—
1603,XIII.,"Think not that in yon columns, file"
1604,XIII.,Thy conquering troops from distant Dyle—
1605,XIII.,Is Blucher yet unknown?
1606,XIII.,Or dwells not in thy memory still
1607,XIII.,"(Heard frequent in thine hour of ill),"
1608,XIII.,What notes of hate and vengeance thrill
1609,XIII.,In Prussia’s trumpet-tone?—
1610,XIII.,What yet remains?—shall it be thine
1611,XIII.,To head the relics of thy line
1612,XIII.,In one dread effort more?—
1613,XIII.,"The Roman lore thy leisure loved,"
1614,XIII.,And than canst tell what fortune proved
1615,XIII.,"That Chieftain, who, of yore,"
1616,XIII.,Ambition’s dizzy paths essayed
1617,XIII.,And with the gladiators’ aid
1618,XIII.,For empire enterprised—
1619,XIII.,"He stood the cast his rashness played,"
1620,XIII.,"Left not the victims he had made,"
1621,XIII.,"Dug his red grave with his own blade,"
1622,XIII.,"And on the field he lost was laid,"
1623,XIII.,Abhorred—but not despised.
1624,XIII.,
1625,XIV.,XIV.
1626,XIV.,
1627,XIV.,But if revolves thy fainter thought
1628,XIV.,"On safety—howsoever bought,—"
1629,XIV.,"Then turn thy fearful rein and ride,"
1630,XIV.,Though twice ten thousand men have died
1631,XIV.,On this eventful day
1632,XIV.,To gild the military fame
1633,XIV.,"Which thou, for life, in traffic tame"
1634,XIV.,Wilt barter thus away.
1635,XIV.,Shall future ages tell this tale
1636,XIV.,Of inconsistence faint and frail?
1637,XIV.,"And art thou He of Lodi’s bridge,"
1638,XIV.,"Marengo’s field, and Wagram’s ridge!"
1639,XIV.,"Or is thy soul like mountain-tide,"
1640,XIV.,"That, swelled by winter storm and shower,"
1641,XIV.,"Rolls down in turbulence of power,"
1642,XIV.,A torrent fierce and wide;
1643,XIV.,"Reft of these aids, a rill obscure,"
1644,XIV.,"Shrinking unnoticed, mean and poor,"
1645,XIV.,Whose channel shows displayed
1646,XIV.,"The wrecks of its impetuous course,"
1647,XIV.,But not one symptom of the force
1648,XIV.,By which these wrecks were made!
1649,XIV.,
1650,XV.,XV.
1651,XV.,
1652,XV.,Spur on thy way!—since now thine ear
1653,XV.,"Has brooked thy veterans’ wish to hear,"
1654,XV.,"Who, as thy flight they eyed"
1655,XV.,"Exclaimed,—while tears of anguish came,"
1656,XV.,"Wrung forth by pride, and rage, and shame,"
1657,XV.,“O that he had but died!”
1658,XV.,"But yet, to sum this hour of ill,"
1659,XV.,"Look, ere thou leav’st the fatal hill,"
1660,XV.,Back on yon broken ranks—
1661,XV.,Upon whose wild confusion gleams
1662,XV.,"The moon, as on the troubled streams"
1663,XV.,"When rivers break their banks,"
1664,XV.,"And, to the ruined peasant’s eye,"
1665,XV.,"Objects half seen roll swiftly by,"
1666,XV.,Down the dread current hurled—
1667,XV.,"So mingle banner, wain, and gun,"
1668,XV.,Where the tumultuous flight rolls on
1669,XV.,"Of warriors, who, when morn begun,"
1670,XV.,Defied a banded world.
1671,XV.,

1676,XVI.,"Tells, that upon their broken rear"
1677,XVI.,Rages the Prussian’s bloody spear.
1678,XVI.,"So fell a shriek was none,"
1679,XVI.,When Beresina’s icy flood
1680,XVI.,"Reddened and thawed with flame and blood,"
1681,XVI.,"And, pressing on thy desperate way,"
1682,XVI.,"Raised oft and long their wild hurra,"
1683,XVI.,The children of the Don.
1684,XVI.,Thine ear no yell of horror cleft
1685,XVI.,"So ominous, when, all bereft"
1686,XVI.,"Of aid, the valiant Polack left—"
1687,XVI.,"Ay, left by thee—found soldiers grave"
1688,XVI.,In Leipsic’s corpse-encumbered wave.
1689,XVI.,"Fate, in those various perils past,"

1728,XVII.,"No islet calls thee lord,"
1729,XVII.,"We leave thee no confederate band,"
