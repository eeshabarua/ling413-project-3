159,ACT I,SCENE I.--_Forest; a poor hut in the background_. GOETZ _and_
160,GEORGE.,GEORGE.
161,GEORGE.,
162,GEORGE.,"GOETZ: Where can my men be? Up and down I have to walk, lest sleep"
163,GEORGE.,should overcome me. Five days and nights already in ambush. But when
164,GEORGE.,"I get thee, Weislingen, I shall make up for it! You priests may send"
165,GEORGE.,round your obliging Weislingen to decry me--I am awake. You escaped
166,GEORGE.,"me, bishop! So your dear Weislingen may pay the piper. George! George!"
167,GEORGE.,(_Enter_ GEORGE.) Tell Hans to get ready. My scouts may be back any
168,GEORGE.,moment. And give me some more wine!
169,GEORGE.,
170,GEORGE.,GEORGE: Hark! I hear some horses galloping--two--it must be your
171,GEORGE.,men!
172,GEORGE.,
173,GEORGE.,"GOETZ: My horse, quick! Tell Hans to arm!"
174,GEORGE.,
175,GEORGE.,"[_Enter_ FAUD, _who reports to_ GOETZ _that_ WEISLINGEN _is"
176,GEORGE.,approaching. Exit_ GOETZ _and his men_.
177,GEORGE.,
178,GEORGE.,"GEORGE: Oh, St. George! Make me strong and brave! And give me spear,"
179,GEORGE.,"armour, and horse!                                            [_Exit._"
180,GEORGE.,
181,GEORGE.,
182,GEORGE.,SCENE II.--_Hall at Jaxthausen_. ELIZABETH _and_ MARIE.
183,GEORGE.,
184,GEORGE.,"MARIE: If I had a husband who always exposed himself to danger, I"
185,GEORGE.,should die the first year.
186,GEORGE.,
187,GEORGE.,"ELIZABETH: Thank God, I am made of harder stuff! God grant that my"
188,GEORGE.,"boy may take after his father, and not become a treacherous hypocrite,"
189,GEORGE.,like Weislingen.
190,GEORGE.,
191,GEORGE.,MARIE: You are very bitter against him. Yet report speaks well of
192,GEORGE.,"him. Your own husband loved him, when they were pages together to the"
193,GEORGE.,margrave.
194,GEORGE.,
195,GEORGE.,[_The gay tune of a wind-instrument is heard_.
196,GEORGE.,
197,GEORGE.,ELIZABETH: There he returns with his spoil! I must get the meal
198,GEORGE.,"ready. Here, take the cellar keys and let them have of the best wine!"
199,GEORGE.,They have deserved it.
200,GEORGE.,
201,GEORGE.,"[_Exeunt. Enter_ GOETZ, WEISLINGEN, _and men-at-arms._"

203,GEORGE.,*       *       *       *       *
204,GEORGE.,
205,GEORGE.,GOETZ (_taking off his helmet and sword_): Unstrap my cuirass and
206,GEORGE.,"give me my doublet! Weislingen, you've given us hard work! Be of good"
207,GEORGE.,"cheer. Where are your clothes? I could lend you some of mine--a neat,"
208,GEORGE.,"clean suit, which I wore at the wedding of my gracious lord the Count"
209,GEORGE.,"Palatine, when your bishop got so vexed with me, because I made him"
210,GEORGE.,"shake hands with me, unknown, after having taken two of his ships a"
211,GEORGE.,fortnight before on the Main.
212,GEORGE.,
213,GEORGE.,WEISLINGEN: I beg you to leave me alone.
214,GEORGE.,
215,GEORGE.,"GOETZ: Why? Pray, be cheerful. You are in my power, and I shall not"
216,GEORGE.,abuse it. You know my knight's duty is sacred to me. And now I must go
217,GEORGE.,to see my wife.                                             [_Exit._
218,GEORGE.,
219,GEORGE.,"WEISLINGEN: Oh, that it were all a dream! In Berlichingen's power--and"
220,GEORGE.,"he, the old true-hearted Goetz! Back again in the hall, where we played"
221,GEORGE.,"as boys, where I loved him with all my heart! How strangely past and"
222,GEORGE.,present seem to intermingle here.
223,GEORGE.,
224,GEORGE.,"[_Enter_ GOETZ, _and a man with jug and goblet_."
225,GEORGE.,
226,GEORGE.,"GOETZ: Let us drink, until the meal is ready. Come, you are at home."
227,GEORGE.,It is a long time since we last shared a bottle. (_Raising his goblet_)
228,GEORGE.,A gay heart!
229,GEORGE.,
230,GEORGE.,WEISLINGEN: Those times are past.
231,GEORGE.,
232,GEORGE.,GOETZ: Heaven forbid! Though merrier days we may not find. If you had
233,GEORGE.,"only followed me to Brabant, instead of taking to that miserable life"
234,GEORGE.,at court! Are you not as free and nobly born as anyone in Germany?
235,GEORGE.,"Independent, subject only to the emperor? And you submit to vassals,"
236,GEORGE.,who poison the emperor's ear against me! They want to get rid of me.
237,GEORGE.,"And you, Weislingen, are their tool!"
238,GEORGE.,
239,GEORGE.,WEISLINGEN: Berlichingen!
240,GEORGE.,
241,GEORGE.,GOETZ: No more of it! I hate explanations. They only lead to
242,GEORGE.,"deceiving one or the other, or both."
243,GEORGE.,
244,GEORGE.,"[_They stand apart, their backs turned to each other."
245,GEORGE.,Enter_ MARIE.
246,GEORGE.,
247,GEORGE.,MARIE (_to_ WEISLINGEN): I come to greet and to invite you in
248,GEORGE.,my sister's name. What is it? Why are you silent both? You are host
249,GEORGE.,and guest. Be guided by a woman's voice.
250,GEORGE.,
251,GEORGE.,GOETZ: You remind me of my duty.
252,GEORGE.,
253,GEORGE.,WEISLINGEN: Who could resist so heavenly a hint?
254,GEORGE.,
255,GEORGE.,"MARIE: Draw near each other, be reconciled! (_The men shake hands_.)"
256,GEORGE.,The union of brave men is the most ardent wish of all good women.

260,ACT II,
261,ACT II,SCENE I.--_A room at Jaxthausen_. Marie _and_ Weislingen.
262,ACT II,
263,ACT II,"MARIE: You say you love me. I willingly believe it, and hope to be"
264,ACT II,happy with you and to make you happy.
265,ACT II,
266,ACT II,WEISLINGEN: Blessed be your brother and the day he rode out to
267,ACT II,capture me!                                          [_Enter_ Goetz.
268,ACT II,
269,ACT II,"GOETZ: Your page is back. Whatever his news, Adelbert, you are"
270,ACT II,free! All I ask is your word that you will not aid and abet my
271,ACT II,enemies.
272,ACT II,
273,ACT II,WEISLINGEN: I take your hand. And may I at the same time take
274,ACT II,the hand of this noblest of all women?
275,ACT II,
276,ACT II,"GOETZ: May I say ""yes"" for you, Marie? You need not blush--your"
277,ACT II,"eyes have answered clearly. Well, then, Weislingen, take her hand,"
278,ACT II,"and I say Amen, friend and brother! I must call my wife. Elizabeth!"
279,ACT II,"(_Enter_ ELIZABETH.) Join your hand in theirs and say ""God bless"
280,ACT II,"you!"" They are a pair. Adelbert is going back to Bamberg to detach"
281,ACT II,"himself openly from the bishop, and then to his estates to settle"
282,ACT II,his affairs. And now we'll leave him undisturbed to hear his boy's
283,ACT II,report.
284,ACT II,[_Exit with_ Marie _and_ Elizabeth.
285,ACT II,
286,ACT II,WEISLINGEN: Such bliss for one so unworthy!
287,ACT II,[_Enter_ Franz.
288,ACT II,
289,ACT II,"FRANZ: God save you, noble sir! I bring you greetings from"
290,ACT II,everybody in Bamberg--from the bishop down to the jester. How they
291,ACT II,are distressed at your mishap! I am to tell you to be patient--they
292,ACT II,will think the more impatiently of your deliverance; for they cannot
293,ACT II,spare you.
294,ACT II,
295,ACT II,"WEISLINGEN: They will have to. I'll return, but not to stay long."
296,ACT II,
297,ACT II,"FRANZ: Not to stay? My lord, if you but knew what I know! If you"
298,ACT II,"had but seen her--the angel in the shape of woman, who makes Bamberg"
299,ACT II,a forecourt of heaven--Adelheid von Walldorf!
300,ACT II,
301,ACT II,WEISLINGEN: I have heard much of her beauty. Is her husband at
302,ACT II,court?
303,ACT II,
304,ACT II,"FRANZ: She has been widowed for four months, and is at Bamberg for"
305,ACT II,"amusement. If she looks upon you, it is as though you were basking in"
306,ACT II,spring sunshine.
307,ACT II,
308,ACT II,WEISLINGEN: Her charms would be lost on me. I am betrothed. Marie
309,ACT II,"will be the happiness of my life. And now pack up. First to Bamberg,"
310,ACT II,and then to my castle.                                    [_Exeunt._
311,ACT II,
312,ACT II,
313,ACT II,"SCENE II.--_A forest. Some Nuremberg merchants, who, attacked on their"
314,ACT II,"way to the Frankfurt Fair by_ Goetz _and his men, have"
315,ACT II,"escaped, leaving their goods in the hands of the knights."
316,ACT II,"The page_ George _has, however, recaptured two of the"
317,ACT II,merchants as_ Goetz _and his men enter_.
318,ACT II,
319,ACT II,GOETZ: Search the forest! Let none escape!
320,ACT II,
321,ACT II,GEORGE (_stepping forward_): I've done some preparatory work. Here
322,ACT II,they are.
323,ACT II,
324,ACT II,"GOETZ: Welcome, good lad! Keep them well guarded! (_Exit his men"
325,ACT II,"with the merchants_.) And now, what news of Weislingen?"
326,ACT II,
327,ACT II,"GEORGE: Bad news! He looked confused when I said to him, ""A few"
328,ACT II,"words from your Berlichingen."" He tried to put me off with empty words,"
329,ACT II,"but when I pressed him he said he was under no obligation to you, and"
330,ACT II,would have nothing to do with you.
331,ACT II,
332,ACT II,GOETZ: Enough! I shall not forget this infamous treachery. Whoever
333,ACT II,gets into my power shall feel it. (_Exit_ GEORGE.) I'll revel in their
334,ACT II,"agony, deride their fear. And how, Goetz, are you thus changed? Should"
335,ACT II,"other people's faults and vices make you renounce your chivalry, and"
336,ACT II,"abandon yourself to vulgar cruelty? I'll drag him back in chains, if"
337,ACT II,"I can't get him any other way. And there's an end of it, Goetz; think"
338,ACT II,of your duty!
339,ACT II,[_Enter_ GEORGE _with a casket_.
340,ACT II,
341,ACT II,"GEORGE: Now let your joke be ended, they are frightened enough. One"
342,ACT II,"of them, a handsome young man, gave me this casket, and said, ""Take"
343,ACT II,"this as ransom! The jewels I meant to take to my betrothed. Take them,"
344,ACT II,"and let me escape."""
345,ACT II,
346,ACT II,"GOETZ (_examining the jewels_): This time, Marie, I shall not be"
347,ACT II,tempted to bring it to you as a birthday gift. Even in your misfortune
348,ACT II,"you would rejoice in the happiness of others. Take it, George. Give"
349,ACT II,"it back to the lad. Let him take it to his bride, with greeting from"
350,ACT II,Goetz! And let all the prisoners free at sunset.

354,ACT III,
355,ACT III,"SCENE I.--_Pleasure-garden at Augsburg. The_ EMPEROR, _the_ BISHOP OF"
356,ACT III,"BAMBERG, WEISLINGEN, _the_ LADY ADELHEID, COURTIERS."
357,ACT III,
358,ACT III,EMPEROR: I am tired of these merchants with their eternal
359,ACT III,"complaints! Every shopkeeper wants help, and no one will stir against"
360,ACT III,the common enemy of the empire and of Christianity.
361,ACT III,
362,ACT III,WEISLINGEN: Who would be active abroad while he is threatened at
363,ACT III,home?
364,ACT III,
365,ACT III,BISHOP: If we could only remove that proud Sickingen and
366,ACT III,"Berlichingen, the others would soon fall asunder."
367,ACT III,
368,ACT III,"EMPEROR: Brave, noble men at heart, who must be spared and used"
369,ACT III,against the Turks.
370,ACT III,
371,ACT III,WEISLINGEN: The consequences may be dangerous. Better to capture
372,ACT III,them and leave them quietly upon their knightly parole in their
373,ACT III,castles.
374,ACT III,
375,ACT III,"EMPEROR: If they then abide by the law, they might again be"
376,ACT III,honourably and usefully employed. I shall open the session of the Diet
377,ACT III,to-morrow with this proposal.
378,ACT III,
379,ACT III,WEISLINGEN: A clamour of joyful assent will spare your majesty the

381,ACT III,
382,ACT III,"[_Exit_ EMPEROR, BISHOP, _and_ COURTIERS."
383,ACT III,
384,ACT III,WEISLINGEN: And so you mean to go--to leave the festive scenes for
385,ACT III,"which you longed with all your heart, to leave a friend to whom you"
386,ACT III,"are indispensable, to delay our union?"
387,ACT III,
388,ACT III,"ADELHEID: The gayer, the freer shall I return to you."
389,ACT III,
390,ACT III,WEISLINGEN: Will you be content if we proceed against Berlichingen?
391,ACT III,
392,ACT III,"ADELHEID: You deserve a kiss! My uncle, Von Wanzenau, must be"
393,ACT III,captain!
394,ACT III,
395,ACT III,WEISLINGEN: Impossible! An incompetent old dreamer!
396,ACT III,
397,ACT III,"ADELHEID: Let the fiery Werdenhagen, his sister's stepson, go with"
398,ACT III,him.
399,ACT III,
400,ACT III,"WEISLINGEN: He is thoughtless and foolhardy, and will not improve"
401,ACT III,matters.
402,ACT III,
403,ACT III,"ADELHEID: We have to think of our relatives. For love of me, you"
404,ACT III,must do it! And I want some exemptions for the convent of St. Emmerau;
405,ACT III,you can work the chancellor. Then the cup-bearer's post is vacant at
406,ACT III,"the Hessian Court, and the high stewardship of the Palatinate. I want"
407,ACT III,them for our friends Braimau and Mirsing.
408,ACT III,
409,ACT III,WEISLINGEN: How shall I remember it all?
410,ACT III,
411,ACT III,"ADELHEID: I shall train a starling to repeat the names to you, and"
412,ACT III,"to add, ""Please, please."" (_Exit_ WEISLINGEN. _To_ FRANZ, _whom she"
413,ACT III,"stops as he crosses to follow his master_): Franz, could you get me"
414,ACT III,"a starling, or would you yourself be my starling? You would learn"
415,ACT III,more rapidly.
416,ACT III,
417,ACT III,FRANZ: If you would teach me. Try. Take me with you.
418,ACT III,
419,ACT III,"ADELHEID: No, you must serve me here. Have you a good memory?"
420,ACT III,
421,ACT III,FRANZ: For your words. I remember every syllable you spoke to me
422,ACT III,that first day at Bamberg.
423,ACT III,
424,ACT III,"ADELHEID: Now, listen, Franz. I shall tell you the names which I"
425,ACT III,"want you to repeat to your master, always adding, ""Please, please."""
426,ACT III,
427,ACT III,"FRANZ (_seizing her hand passionately_): Please, please!"
428,ACT III,
429,ACT III,ADELHEID (_stepping back_): Hands are not wanted. You must lose
430,ACT III,such bad manners. But you must not be so upset at a little rebuke.
431,ACT III,One punishes the children one loves.
432,ACT III,
433,ACT III,"FRANZ: You love me, then?"
434,ACT III,
435,ACT III,"ADELHEID: I might love you as a child, but you are getting too tall"

443,ACT III,SICKINGEN: To be deceived by him is an honour for you both. I want
444,ACT III,"a mistress for my castles and gardens. In the field, at court, I want"
445,ACT III,to stand alone.

452,ACT III,"GOETZ: Sickingen, you hear. Take back your offer, and leave me!"
453,ACT III,

455,ACT III,than in time of war and danger.

457,ACT III,GOETZ: On one condition. You must publicly detach yourself from me.
458,ACT III,"The emperor loves and esteems you, and your intercession may save me"

476,FAUD.,
477,FAUD.,SELBITZ: What do you see?
478,FAUD.,
479,FAUD.,FAUD: Your horsemen are turning tail. I can see Goetz's three black
480,FAUD.,"feathers in the midst of the turmoil. Woe, he has fallen! And George's"
481,FAUD.,blue plume has disappeared! Sickingen's horsemen in flight! Ha! I see

875,FOOTNOTES:,the life of a German soldier of fortune who flourished between 1480
876,FOOTNOTES:,and 1562. The possibilities of his biography inspired Goethe (Vol.
877,FOOTNOTES:,"IV, p. 253) with the idea of doing for Germany what Shakespeare had"
878,FOOTNOTES:,done for mediæval England. In a few weeks he had turned the life into
879,FOOTNOTES:,"a series of vivid dramatic pictures, which so engrossed him that he"
880,FOOTNOTES:,"""forgot Homer, Shakespeare, and everything."" For the next two years"
881,FOOTNOTES:,the manuscript lay untouched. In 1773 he made a careful revision and
882,FOOTNOTES:,"published it anonymously under the title of ""Goetz von Berlichingen of"
883,FOOTNOTES:,"the Iron Hand""; it is in this form we possess the work now. At a still"
884,FOOTNOTES:,"later period, in 1804, Goethe prepared another version of the play"
885,FOOTNOTES:,"for the stage. The subject-matter of ""Goetz"" is purely revolutionary."
886,FOOTNOTES:,"Goetz, the hero himself, is a champion of a good cause--the cause"
887,FOOTNOTES:,of freedom and self-reliance. He is the embodiment of sturdy German
888,FOOTNOTES:,"virtues, the Empire and the Church playing the unenviable role of"
889,FOOTNOTES:,"intrigue and oppression. As a stage play, ""Goetz"" is ill-constructed,"

1038,ACT II,The gods avenge not on the son the deeds

1045,ACT II,A strange and god-like woman holds in check
1046,ACT II,The execution of the bloody law.

1066,ACT II,"We are from Crete, Adrastus' sons; and I"
1067,ACT II,"Am Cephalus; my eldest brother, he,"

1096,ACT II,"The monarch, for the welfare of the Greeks,"

1098,ACT II,This planted such abhorrence that forthwith

1143,ACT III,Before them fumes a mist of Acheron.
1144,ACT III,I am Orestes! and this guilty head

1212,ACT IV,Let us then hasten; guide me to the fane.
1213,ACT IV,I can unaided on my shoulder bear

1222,ACT IV,Alas! Why hast thou failed to shroud thyself
1223,ACT IV,Within the veil of sacerdotal rights?
1224,ACT IV,
1225,ACT IV,IPHIGENIA: I never have employed them as a veil.
1226,ACT IV,

1353,ACT V,We now perceive the error which the god

1415,ACT I,"SCENE.--_A room in the_ GOVERNOR'S _house. The_ GOVERNOR, _a coarse"
1416,ACT I,"and ill-educated official, and several functionaries of the"
1417,ACT I,town_.
1418,ACT I,
1419,ACT I,GOVERNOR (_addressing the functionaries_): I have bad news. An
1420,ACT I,inspector-general is coming from St. Petersburg. You must see that
1421,ACT I,your various departments are set in order. The hospital must be tidied
1422,ACT I,up and the patients must be provided with nice white night-caps. The
1423,ACT I,school-teachers must coach up the scholars in their subjects.
1424,ACT I,
1425,ACT I,[_Enter_ BOBCHINSKI _and_ DOBCHINSKI _breathlessly_.
1426,ACT I,
1427,ACT I,BOBCHINSKI: What an extraordinary incident!
1428,ACT I,

1430,ACT I,
1431,ACT I,ALL: What is it? What is it?
1432,ACT I,
1433,ACT I,BOBCHINSKI: I will tell you correctly. After you had received the
1434,ACT I,"letter from St. Petersburg, I ran out to tell the postmaster what it"
1435,ACT I,had announced. On the way Dobchinski pressed me to go into the inn
1436,ACT I,for refreshment. Into the restaurant came an elegant young man with a
1437,ACT I,fashionable aspect. The landlord told us he was an official on his way
1438,ACT I,"from Petersburg to Saratov, and that he is acting strangely, for he has"
1439,ACT I,"been here more than a fortnight, and pays for nothing."
1440,ACT I,
1441,ACT I,GOVERNOR: Good lord! Surely it cannot be he! Been here a fortnight?
1442,ACT I,"May heaven help us. You, sirs, get all your departments in proper trim."
1443,ACT I,"In the meantime I will take a stroll round the town, and satisfy myself"
1444,ACT I,that travellers are treated with due respect.
1445,ACT I,
1446,ACT I,The governor orders the police to see that the street leading to the
1447,ACT I,inn is well swept. He threatens to punish severely any of the
1448,ACT I,townspeople who shall dare to bring complaints of any kind to the
1449,ACT I,visiting official.

1454,ACT II,SCENE.--_A small room in the inn_. OSIP _lying on his master's bed_.
1455,ACT II,
1456,ACT II,OSIP: Devil take it! I am famishing. It is two months since we left
1457,ACT II,St. Petersburg. This master of mine has squandered all his money on the
1458,ACT II,"way, and here we are penniless. The old man sends his son money, but"
1459,ACT II,"he goes on the racket with it till all is spent, and then he has to"
1460,ACT II,pawn his clothes almost to the last rag. And now this landlord declares
1461,ACT II,"he will let us have nothing more to eat unless we pay in advance. Ah,"
1462,ACT II,there's the knock.
1463,ACT II,
1464,ACT II,[_He gets off the bed_. KHELSTAKOV _enters_.
1465,ACT II,
1466,ACT II,KHELSTAKOV: Go down and ask for something to eat.
1467,ACT II,
1468,ACT II,OSIP: No. The landlord will not let us have it. He says we are
1469,ACT II,"swindlers, and he threatens to have you put in prison."
1470,ACT II,
1471,ACT II,KHELSTAKOV: Go to the devil! Call the landlord. (OSIP _goes_.) How
1472,ACT II,fearfully hungry I am. And I was cheated at cards and cleaned right out
1473,ACT II,at Penza by that infantry captain. What a miserable little town this
1474,ACT II,is. They give no credit at the provision shops.
1475,ACT II,
1476,ACT II,[_Enter_ WAITER.
1477,ACT II,
1478,ACT II,WAITER: The landlord asks what you want.
1479,ACT II,
1480,ACT II,KHELSTAKOV: Please bring my dinner at once. I must be busy directly
1481,ACT II,I have dined.
1482,ACT II,
1483,ACT II,"The waiter replies that the landlord refuses to supply anything more,"
1484,ACT II,and seems likely to complain to the governor. But presently dinner is
1485,ACT II,brought in. To Khlestakov's great consternation Osip announces that
1486,ACT II,the governor has come and is asking for him.
1487,ACT II,
1488,ACT II,KHELSTAKOV: What? The landlord has reported me! I'll put on an
1489,ACT II,"aristocratic air, and ask him how he dares----"
1490,ACT II,
1491,ACT II,"Governor, entering in trepidation and saluting humbly, astonishes him"
1492,ACT II,"by profuse offers of hospitality and entertainment, though when at"
1493,ACT II,"first mention is made of taking him to other quarters, the guest in"
1494,ACT II,"horror ejaculates that he supposes the gaol is meant, and he asks what"
1495,ACT II,right the governor has to hint at such a thing.
1496,ACT II,
1497,ACT II,KHELSTAKOV (_indignantly_): How dare you? I--I--I am a government
1498,ACT II,official at St. Petersburg. I--I--I----
1499,ACT II,
1500,ACT II,"GOVERNOR (_aside_): Good heavens, what a rage he is in! He knows"
1501,ACT II,everything. Those confounded merchants have told him all.
1502,ACT II,
1503,ACT II,"Banging the table, Khlestakov declares he will _not_ go to the"
1504,ACT II,"gaol, but will complain to the Minister of the Interior; and the"
1505,ACT II,"governor, trembling and terrified, pleads that he has a wife and"
1506,ACT II,"little children, and begs that he may not be ruined. The ridiculous"
1507,ACT II,misunderstanding on both sides grows more confused every minute. The
1508,ACT II,governor pours forth the most abject apologies; declares that if the
1509,ACT II,"people accuse him of oppression and extortion, and even of flogging"
1510,ACT II,"women, they are a slandering mob."
1511,ACT II,
1512,ACT II,KHELSTAKOV: What have I to do with your enemies or the women you have
1513,ACT II,"flogged? Don't attempt to flog me. Now, look here, I will pay this"
1514,ACT II,"landlord's account, but just now I have not the money. That is why I am"
1515,ACT II,staying here.
1516,ACT II,
1517,ACT II,"GOVERNOR (_aside_): Sly rogue, trying to mystify me! (_Aloud_) If you"
1518,ACT II,"really are short of money, I am ready to serve you at once."
1519,ACT II,
1520,ACT II,"The visitor says that he will in that case borrow 200 roubles, and the"
1521,ACT II,"money is readily handed over; in fact, the governor quietly slips in"
1522,ACT II,"200 extra roubles. The governor, convinced that the inspector-general"
1523,ACT II,"is simply determined to keep up his _incognito_, resolves to act"
1524,ACT II,"accordingly, and to tell falsehoods appropriate for mutual deception."
1525,ACT II,"He invites the guest to visit Various institutions, and a round is"
1526,ACT II,made.

1532,ACT III,other functionaries_.
1533,ACT III,
1534,ACT III,KHELSTAKOV: Fine establishments! In other towns they showed me
1535,ACT III,nothing.
1536,ACT III,
1537,ACT III,GOVERNOR: In other towns I venture to say that the officials
1538,ACT III,think most about their own profit; here we only aim at winning the
1539,ACT III,approbation of the government.
1540,ACT III,
1541,ACT III,KHELSTAKOV: That lunch was very good! The fish was delicious! Where
1542,ACT III,"was it that we lunched? Was it not at the hospital? I saw the beds,"
1543,ACT III,but there were not many patients. Have the sick recovered?
1544,ACT III,
1545,ACT III,"GOVERNOR: Yes. Since I became governor they all get well like flies,"
1546,ACT III,"not so much by doctoring as by honesty and regularity. Thank God,"
1547,ACT III,everything goes satisfactorily here! Another governor would undoubtedly
1548,ACT III,"look after his own advantage; but, believe me, when I lie down to"
1549,ACT III,"sleep, my prayer is, ""O Thou my Lord, may the government perceive my"
1550,ACT III,"zeal and be satisfied."" So I have an easy conscience."
1551,ACT III,
1552,ACT III,KHELSTAKOV: Are there any clubs here where a game at cards could be
1553,ACT III,had?
1554,ACT III,
1555,ACT III,GOVERNOR: God forbid! Here such a thing as a card-club is never heard
1556,ACT III,"of. I am disgusted at the sight of a card, and never dealt one in my"
1557,ACT III,"life. Once to amuse the children I built a house of cards, and had"
1558,ACT III,accursed dreams all night.
1559,ACT III,
1560,ACT III,LUKA (_aside_): But the villain cheated me yesterday out of a hundred
1561,ACT III,roubles!
1562,ACT III,
1563,ACT III,"Introduced to the governor's wife and daughter, Khlestakov addresses"
1564,ACT III,"them in the manner of a gallant from the metropolis, and chatters"
1565,ACT III,"boastfully of his influence, his position, and his connections."
1566,ACT III,"His house is the first in St. Petersburg. Meantime, the various"
1567,ACT III,functionaries meet in the house of the governor to concert measures
1568,ACT III,for propitiating this great courtier. They resolve to present him with
1569,ACT III,a substantial token of regard. With great trepidation they wait on him.
1570,ACT III,
1571,ACT III,JUDGE (_entering very nervously_): I have the honour to present
1572,ACT III,"myself. I have been judge here since 1816, and have been decorated"
1573,ACT III,with the Vladimir of the Fourth Class.
1574,ACT III,
1575,ACT III,KHELSTAKOV: What have you there in your hand?
1576,ACT III,
1577,ACT III,JUDGE (_in bewilderment drops banknotes on the floor_): Nothing.
1578,ACT III,
1579,ACT III,KHELSTAKOV: How nothing? I see some money has been dropped.
1580,ACT III,
1581,ACT III,"JUDGE (_trembling and aside_): O heaven, I am already before the"
1582,ACT III,"tribunal, and they have brought the cart to take me into exile."
1583,ACT III,
1584,ACT III,"Khlestakov picks up the notes, and asks that the money may be lent"
1585,ACT III,"him, as he has spent all his cash on the journey. He promises to"
1586,ACT III,"return it as soon as he reaches home, but the judge protests that the"
1587,ACT III,"honour of lending it is enough, and he begs that there shall be no"
1588,ACT III,injunction against him.
1589,ACT III,
1590,ACT III,"Next to present himself is the postmaster, in full uniform, sword in"
1591,ACT III,"hand. After a little conversation with this functionary, Khlestakov"
1592,ACT III,"thinks he may just as well borrow of him also, and he forthwith"
1593,ACT III,"mentions that a singular thing has happened to him, for he has lost"
1594,ACT III,"all his money on the way, and would be glad to be obliged with the"
1595,ACT III,loan of three hundred roubles. It is instantly counted out with
1596,ACT III,"alacrity, and the postmaster hastily retires. Also, in a very nervous"
1597,ACT III,"state, Luka, the School Director, the Charity Commissioner, Bobchinski"
1598,ACT III,"and Dobchinski, come to pay their homage, and Khlestakov borrows"
1599,ACT III,easily from each in turn.
1600,ACT III,
1601,ACT III,"KHELSTAKOV _(alone):_ There are many officials here; it seems to me,"
1602,ACT III,"however, that they take me for a government functionary. What fools! I"
1603,ACT III,must write about it all to Tryapitchkin at Petersburg; he will write
1604,ACT III,"sketches of it in the papers. Here, Osip, bring me paper and ink! I"
1605,ACT III,"will just see how much money I have got. Oh, more than a thousand!"
1606,ACT III,
1607,ACT III,While he is writing a letter Osip interrupts him with earnest
1608,ACT III,assurances that it will be prudent to depart speedily from the town;
1609,ACT III,"for people have been mistaking him for somebody else, and awkward"
1610,ACT III,complications may ensue. It is really time to go. There are splendid
1611,ACT III,"horses here, and these can be secured for the journey. Khlestakov"
1612,ACT III,"consents, tells Osip to take the letter to the post, and to obtain"
1613,ACT III,good posthorses. Suddenly some merchants present themselves with
1614,ACT III,"petitions, bringing with them gifts of sugar-loaves and wine. They"
1615,ACT III,pour forth bitter complaints against the governor. They accuse him
1616,ACT III,of constant and outrageous extortion. They beg Khlestakov to secure
1617,ACT III,his deposition from office. When they offer the sugar-loaves and the
1618,ACT III,"wine, Khlestakov protests that he cannot accept bribes, but if they"
1619,ACT III,would offer him a loan of three hundred roubles that would be another
1620,ACT III,matter. They do so and go out.
1621,ACT III,
1622,ACT III,[_Enter_ MARYA _nervously_.
1623,ACT III,
1624,ACT III,MARYA: Ach!
1625,ACT III,
1626,ACT III,KHELSTAKOV: Why are you so frightened?
1627,ACT III,
1628,ACT III,MARYA: No; I am not frightened. I thought mamma might be here. I am
1629,ACT III,disturbing you in your important business.
1630,ACT III,
1631,ACT III,KHELSTAKOV: But your eyes are more attractive than important
1632,ACT III,business.
1633,ACT III,
1634,ACT III,MARYA: You are talking in St. Petersburg style.
1635,ACT III,
1636,ACT III,KHELSTAKOV: May I venture to be so happy as to offer you a chair?
1637,ACT III,"But no; you should be offered a throne, not a chair! I offer you my"
1638,ACT III,"love, which ever since your first glance----"
1639,ACT III,
1640,ACT III,MARYA: Love! I do not understand love!
1641,ACT III,
1642,ACT III,"He kisses her on the shoulder, and, when she rises angrily to go,"
1643,ACT III,falls on his knees. At that moment her mother enters. With a show of
1644,ACT III,indignation she orders Marya away.
1645,ACT III,
1646,ACT III,"KHELSTAKOV (_kneeling at her feet_): Madame, you see I burn with"
1647,ACT III,love.
1648,ACT III,
1649,ACT III,"ANNA ANDREYEVNA: But permit me, I do not quite comprehend you. If I"
1650,ACT III,"am not mistaken, you were making a proposal to my daughter?"
1651,ACT III,
1652,ACT III,KHELSTAKOV: No; I am in love with you.
1653,ACT III,
1654,ACT III,ANNA ANDREYEVNA: But I am married!
1655,ACT III,
1656,ACT III,KHELSTAKOV: That is nothing. Let us flee under the canopy of heaven.
1657,ACT III,I crave your hand!
1658,ACT III,
1659,ACT III,"Marya enters, and seeing Khlestakov on his knees, shrieks. The mother"
1660,ACT III,"scolds her for her bad manners, and declares that he was, after"
1661,ACT III,"all, asking for the daughter's hand. Then enters the governor. He"
1662,ACT III,"breathlessly begins to bewail the base, lying conduct of the merchants"
1663,ACT III,"who have been slandering him, and swears he is innocent of oppressing"
1664,ACT III,anybody.
1665,ACT III,
1666,ACT III,"To his profound amazement, Anna informs her husband that the great man"
1667,ACT III,has honoured them by asking for their daughter's hand. On recovering
1668,ACT III,"from his amazement, he sees the couple kissing, and gives them his"
1669,ACT III,"blessing. Osip enters at this juncture to say the horses are ready,"
1670,ACT III,and Khlestakov informs the governor that he is only off to visit for a
1671,ACT III,day a rich uncle. He will quickly return. He presently rides off after
1672,ACT III,affectionate farewell expressions on both sides.

1677,ACT IV,"SCENE.--_As before. The_ GOVERNOR, ANNA ANDREYEVNA, _and_ MARYA. _A"
1678,ACT IV,police-officer enters_.
1679,ACT IV,
1680,ACT IV,"GOVERNOR (_addressing the policeman_): Ivan Karpovitch, summon the"
1681,ACT IV,"merchants here, brother. Complaining of me, indeed! Cursed lot of Jews!"
1682,ACT IV,Little turtle doves! Ascertain who brought petitions; and take care to
1683,ACT IV,let them know how heaven has honoured the governor. His daughter is
1684,ACT IV,going to marry a man without an equal in the world; who can achieve
1685,ACT IV,"everything, everything, everything. Let everybody know! Shout it out to"
1686,ACT IV,"everybody! Ring the bells! Devil take it; now that at length I triumph,"
1687,ACT IV,triumph I will!
1688,ACT IV,
1689,ACT IV,The police-officer retires. The governor and Anna indulge in roseate
1690,ACT IV,prospects of their coming prosperity. Of course they will not stay
1691,ACT IV,"in these mean surroundings, but will remove to St. Petersburg."
1692,ACT IV,Suddenly the merchants enter. The governor receives them with the
1693,ACT IV,"utmost indignation, assails them with a shower of vituperation. They"
1694,ACT IV,abjectly entreat pardon. They promise to make amends by sending very
1695,ACT IV,"handsome presents, and they are enjoined not to forget to do so. The"
1696,ACT IV,wedding gifts are to be worthy of the occasion. The merchants retire
1697,ACT IV,"crestfallen, and callers stream in with profuse congratulations. Anna,"
1698,ACT IV,"with studied haughtiness, makes them fully understand that the family"
1699,ACT IV,will now be far above them all. All the people secretly express to
1700,ACT IV,each other their hatred and contempt for the governor and his family.
1701,ACT IV,
1702,ACT IV,POSTMASTER (_breathlessly entering with an open letter in his hand_):
1703,ACT IV,"An astonishing fact, gentlemen! The official which we took for an"
1704,ACT IV,inspector-general is not one! I have discovered this from a letter
1705,ACT IV,"which he wrote and which I saw was addressed ""Post Office Street."""
1706,ACT IV,"So, as I said to myself that he had been reporting to the authorities"
1707,ACT IV,"something he had found wrong in the postal department, I felt a"
1708,ACT IV,supernatural impulse constraining me to open the letter.
1709,ACT IV,
1710,ACT IV,GOVERNOR: You dared to open the letter of so powerful a personage?
1711,ACT IV,
1712,ACT IV,POSTMASTER: That is just the joke; that he is neither powerful nor
1713,ACT IV,"a personage. I will read the letter. (_Reads_) ""I hasten to inform"
1714,ACT IV,"you, my dear Tryapitchkin, of my experiences. I was cleared out of"
1715,ACT IV,"everything on the way by an infantry captain, so that an innkeeper"
1716,ACT IV,"wanted to put me in prison; when, owing to my Petersburg appearance"
1717,ACT IV,"and dress, the whole town suddenly took me for the governor-general."
1718,ACT IV,"So now I am living with the governor, enjoy myself, and flirt with his"
1719,ACT IV,wife and daughter. These people all lend me as much money as ever I
1720,ACT IV,please. The governor is as stupid as a grey gelding. The postmaster is
1721,ACT IV,"a tippler. The charity commissioner is a pig in a skull-cap."""
1722,ACT IV,
1723,ACT IV,GOVERNOR: I am crushed--crushed--completely crushed. Catch him!
1724,ACT IV,
1725,ACT IV,"POSTMASTER: How can we catch him? I, as if purposely, specially"
1726,ACT IV,ordered for him the very best post-carriage and three horses.
1727,ACT IV,
1728,ACT IV,GOVERNOR: What an old fool I am! I have been thirty years in the
1729,ACT IV,service; not a tradesman nor contractor could cheat me; rogues upon
1730,ACT IV,rogues have I outwitted; three governors-general have I deceived!
1731,ACT IV,
1732,ACT IV,"ANNA ANDREYEVNA: But this cannot be, Antosha. He is engaged to"
1733,ACT IV,Mashenka.
1734,ACT IV,
1735,ACT IV,"GOVERNOR (_enraged_): Engaged! Rubbish! Look, look; all the world,"
1736,ACT IV,"all Christendom, all of you look how the governor is fooled! Fool,"
1737,ACT IV,"fool; old driveller that I am! (_Shakes his fist at himself_) Ah, you"
1738,ACT IV,fat-nose! Taking a rag for a man of rank! And now he is jingling his
1739,ACT IV,bells along the road. Who first said he was an inspector-general?

2496,VI,I was early one fine morning
2497,VI,With Lascaro setting forward
2498,VI,On the bear-hunt. And at mid-day
2499,VI,We arrived at Pont-d'Espagne.
2500,VI,
2501,VI,Evening shades were dark'ning round us
2502,VI,"When we reached the wretched hostel,"
2503,VI,Where the Ollea-Podrida
2504,VI,Steamed up from the dirty soup-dish.
2505,VI,
2506,VI,Corresponding to the kitchen
2507,VI,"Was the bed. It swarmed with insects,"
2508,VI,Just as if it had been peppered!--
2509,VI,Bugs are man's most mortal foe.

2515,VI,
2516,VI,"Well, so be it, charming people!"
2517,VI,But confess that in this temple
2518,VI,All the stairs are slightly awkward.
2519,VI,Miserably bad the stairs!
2520,VI,
2521,VI,"Close beside me strides Lascaro,"
2522,VI,"Pale and long, just like a taper;"
2523,VI,"Never speaking, never smiling,"
2524,VI,"He, the dead son of a witch."
2525,VI,
2526,VI,"Yes, 'tis said, he is a dead one,"
2527,VI,"Long defunct, although his mother,"
2528,VI,"Old Uraka, by enchantments"
2529,VI,Keeps him living to appearance.
2530,VI,
2531,VI,"In the little fishing cottage,"
2532,VI,On the Lac-de-Gobe we met with
2533,VI,Shelter and some trout for dinner;
2534,VI,And they tasted quite delicious.
2535,VI,
2536,VI,If the stuff I drank was really
2537,VI,"Wine, at this same Lac-de-Gobe,"
2538,VI,I know not. I think in Brunswick

2553,VII,
2554,VII,Nearly all that day I lingered
2555,VII,"With the children, and we chatted"

2593,VIII,"Using secret signs as language,"
2594,VIII,"How might Atta Troll be tempted,"
2595,VIII,How he might be put to death.
2596,VIII,
2597,VIII,For right well had we his traces
2598,VIII,Followed up. And now no longer
2599,VIII,Dare escape be thought of. Numbered
2600,VIII,"Are thy days, O Atta Troll!"
2601,VIII,
2602,VIII,What Uraka as her lawful
2603,VIII,"Business followed, that was honest;"
2604,VIII,For she dealt in mountain simples
2605,VIII,And she also sold stuffed birds.
2606,VIII,
2607,VIII,Full of all these natural wonders
2608,VIII,Was the hut. The smell was dreadful
2609,VIII,"Of the henbane, cuckoo-flowers,"
2610,VIII,Dandelion and deadmen's fingers.
2611,VIII,
2612,VIII,"Vultures, too, a large collection,"
2613,VIII,"Carefully arranged on all sides,"
2614,VIII,With the wings at full extended
2615,VIII,And the most enormous beaks.
2616,VIII,
2617,VIII,Was't the odour of the foolish
2618,VIII,Plants which stupefied my senses?
2619,VIII,Strange sensations crept about me
2620,VIII,At the sight of all these birds.

2631,IX,"Heroes of a modern pattern,"
2632,IX,And there's not a classic poet
2633,IX,Would in song immortalise us!

2644,IX,
2645,IX,"Shivering, and with teeth a-chatter,"
2646,IX,Near the hearth I stood awhile;
2647,IX,"Then, as though the warmth o'ercame me,"
2648,IX,Sank at last upon the straw.
2649,IX,
2650,IX,How the roaring of the chimney
2651,IX,Terrified me. Like the moaning
2652,IX,"Of poor, wretched, dried-up souls--"
2653,IX,Quite familiar seemed the voices.
2654,IX,
2655,IX,Sleep completely overcame me
2656,IX,"In the end, and then in place of"
2657,IX,"Waking phantasm, rose before me"
2658,IX,"Quite a wholesome, firm-set dream."
2659,IX,
2660,IX,And I dreamed the little cottage
2661,IX,Suddenly became a ballroom.
2662,IX,Carried up aloft on pillars
2663,IX,And by chandeliers illumined.
2664,IX,
2665,IX,Then invisible musicians
2666,IX,"Struck up from ""Robert le Diable"""
2667,IX,That ungodly dance of nuns;

2679,IX,
2680,IX,"Sometimes in the dance's bustle,"
2681,IX,Tore a bear the burial garment
2682,IX,Off the head of his companion;
2683,IX,Lo! a death's-head came to view.
2684,IX,
2685,IX,But at last sounds forth a joyous
2686,IX,Crashing of the horns and cymbals;
2687,IX,"And the kettle-drums they thunder,"
2688,IX,And there came the galopade.
2689,IX,
2690,IX,This I did not dream the end of--
2691,IX,For a most ill-mannered bruin

2728,X,"""And with soft and supernatural"
2729,X,Flute-like voices they were singing!

2742,X,
2743,X,"""Is it not the voice melodious"

2747,X,
2748,X,"Atta Troll, whilst these words utt'ring,"

2750,X,From the cavern to destruction!
2751,X,Ah! he rushed upon his doom!
2752,X,
2753,X,"In the vale of Ronceval,"
2754,X,On the very spot where whilom
2755,X,Charlemagne's peerless nephew
2756,X,"Gasped away his fleeting spirit,"

2770,XI,
2771,XI,That same day soon after skinning
2772,XI,"Atta Troll, they up to auction"
2773,XI,Put the skin. For just a hundred
2774,XI,Francs a furrier purchased it.
2775,XI,
2776,XI,"Elegantly then he trimmed it,"
2777,XI,"And he edged it round with scarlet,"
2778,XI,And again he sold it quickly
2779,XI,Just for double what it cost.
2780,XI,
2781,XI,"So, at last, third hand possessed it--"
2782,XI,"Julietta, and at Paris"
2783,XI,"It reposes in her chamber,"
2784,XI,Serving as a bed-side carpet.
2785,XI,
2786,XI,"What of Mumma? Ah, the Mumma"

2788,XI,"Is her name! Alas, the women"

2795,XI,
2796,XI,"And at last a fixed appointment,"
2797,XI,"And for life a safe provision,"
2798,XI,Far away she found at Paris
2799,XI,In the famed Jardin des Plantes.
2800,XI,
2801,XI,Sunday last as I was walking
2802,XI,"In the gardens with Julietta,"

2805,XI,
2806,XI,'Twas a powerful desert bear

2893,HOMER[F],"Betwixt Atrides, king of men, and Thetis' god-like son."
2894,HOMER[F],
2895,HOMER[F],"To appease Phoebus, Agamemnon restored the captive daughter of the"
2896,HOMER[F],"sun-god's priest, allotted to him for spoil; but took Briseis from"
2897,HOMER[F],Achilles to replace her. Achilles vowed to render no more aid to the

2906,HOMER[F],Thirsting at all parts to the host.
2907,HOMER[F],
2908,HOMER[F],"To satisfy Thetis, Jupiter sent a false dream to Agamemnon, the king"
2909,HOMER[F],"of men, persuading him that Troy should now fall to his attack."
2910,HOMER[F],"Beguiled by the dream, Agamemnon set forth in battle array the whole"
2911,HOMER[F],"Greek host, save that Achilles and his followers were absent. And the"
2912,HOMER[F],whole host of Troy came forth to meet them. Then Menelaus challenged
2913,HOMER[F],"Paris to single combat; for the twain were the cause of the war,"
2914,HOMER[F],"seeing that Paris had stolen away Helen, the wife of Menelaus. Truce"
2915,HOMER[F],was struck while the combat should take place. Paris hurled his
2916,HOMER[F],"javelin, but did not pierce his foe's shield; Menelaus, having called"
2917,HOMER[F],"on Jove,"
2918,HOMER[F],
2919,HOMER[F],"Shook and threw his lance; which struck through Paris' shield,"
2920,HOMER[F],"And with the strength he gave to it, it made the curets yield,"
2921,HOMER[F],"His coat of mail, his breast; yet he prevented sable death."
2922,HOMER[F],"This taint he followed with his sword, drawn from a silver sheath,"
2923,HOMER[F],"Which lifting high, he struck his helm full where the plume did stand,"
2924,HOMER[F],"On which it piecemeal brake, and fell from his unhappy hand ..."
2925,HOMER[F],"""Lo, now my lance hath missed his end, my sword in shivers flew,"
2926,HOMER[F],"And he 'scapes all."" With this again he rushed upon his guest,"
2927,HOMER[F],"And caught him by the horse-hair plume that dangled on his crest,"
2928,HOMER[F],"With thought to drag him to the Greeks; which he had surely done,"
2929,HOMER[F],"And so, besides the victory, had wondrous glory won."
2930,HOMER[F],But Cyprian Venus brake the string; and so the victor's palm
2931,HOMER[F],"Was, for so full a man at arms, only an empty helm."
2932,HOMER[F],"That then he swung about his head, and cast among his friends,"
2933,HOMER[F],Who scrambled and took it up with shouts. Again then he intends
2934,HOMER[F],"To force the life-blood of his foe, and ran on him amain,"
2935,HOMER[F],"With shaken jav'lin; when the queen that lovers love, again"
2936,HOMER[F],"Attended and now ravish'd him from that encounter quite,"
2937,HOMER[F],"With ease, and wondrous suddenly; for she, a goddess, might."
2938,HOMER[F],"She hid him in a cloud of gold, and never made him known"
2939,HOMER[F],Till in his chamber fresh and sweet she gently set him down.
2940,HOMER[F],
2941,HOMER[F],"Thereupon the truce was treacherously broken by Pandarus, who, incited"
2942,HOMER[F],"by Minerva, wounded Menelaus with an arrow; and the armies closed with"
2943,HOMER[F],each other. Great deeds were done by Diomedes on the Greek side. But
2944,HOMER[F],Hector had gone back to Troy to rouse Paris; on the walls his wife
2945,HOMER[F],Andromache saw him.
2946,HOMER[F],
2947,HOMER[F],"She ran to Hector, and with her, tender of heart and hand,"

2949,HOMER[F],"Compact of many golden stars, the princely child did shine."
2950,HOMER[F],"Hector, though grief bereft his speech, yet smiled upon his joy."
2951,HOMER[F],"Andromache cried out, mix'd hands, and to the strength of Troy"
2952,HOMER[F],"Thus wept forth her affection: ""O noblest in desire!"
2953,HOMER[F],Thy mind inflamed with other's good will set thyself on fire.
2954,HOMER[F],"Nor pitiest thou my son, nor wife, that must thy widow be"

2956,HOMER[F],"""Nay,"" answered he; ""but in this fire must Hector's trial shine;"
2957,HOMER[F],"Here must his country, father, friends, be made in him divine."
2958,HOMER[F],"Yet such a stormy day shall come (in mind and soul I know),"

2972,HOMER[F],"His fearful helm, that on the earth cast round about its light;"
2973,HOMER[F],"Then took and kiss'd his loving son. ""Afflict me not, dear wife,"

2980,HOMER[F],
2981,HOMER[F],"After this, Hector fought with Ajax, and neither had the better. And"
2982,HOMER[F],after that the Greeks set a rampart and a ditch about their ships.
2983,HOMER[F],"Also, Agamemnon would have bidden the Greeks depart altogether, but"
2984,HOMER[F],"Diomedes withstood him. And in the fighting that followed, Agamemnon"
2985,HOMER[F],"showed himself the best man among the Greeks, seeing that neither"
2986,HOMER[F],"Achilles nor Diomedes joined the fray; and the Trojans had the better,"
2987,HOMER[F],"driving the Greeks back to the rampart, and bursting through, so that"
2988,HOMER[F],"they were like to have burnt the Greek ships where they lay, led on by"
2989,HOMER[F],"Hector. To and fro swayed the tide of battle; for while Jove slept,"
2990,HOMER[F],"Neptune and Juno gave force and courage to the Greeks, and the Trojans"
2991,HOMER[F],were borne back; Hector being sore hurt with a stone cast by Ajax. But
2992,HOMER[F],"Jove, awaking, restored Hector's strength, sending Apollo to him. Then"
2993,HOMER[F],Apollo and Hector led
2994,HOMER[F],
2995,HOMER[F],The Trojan forces. The Greeks stood. A fervent clamour spread
2996,HOMER[F],"The air on both sides as they joined. Out flew the shafts and darts,"
2997,HOMER[F],"Some falling short, but other some found butts in breasts and hearts."
2998,HOMER[F],"As long as Phoebus held but out his horrid shield, so long"
2999,HOMER[F],"The darts flew raging either way, and death grew both ways strong."
3000,HOMER[F],"But when the Greeks had seen his face, and who it was that shook"
3001,HOMER[F],"The bristled targe, known by his voice, then all their strength forsook"
3002,HOMER[F],"Their nerves and minds. And then look how a goodly herd of neat,"
3003,HOMER[F],"Or wealthy flock of sheep, being close, and dreadless at their meat,"
3004,HOMER[F],"In some black midnight, suddenly, and not a keeper near,"
3005,HOMER[F],"A brace of horrid bears rush in, and then fly here and there."
3006,HOMER[F],"The poor affrighted flocks or herds, so every way dispersed"
3007,HOMER[F],"The heartless Grecians, so the Sun their headlong chase reversed"
3008,HOMER[F],"To headlong flight, and that day rais'd with all grace Hector's head."
3009,HOMER[F],"... When Hector saw his sister's son lie slaughtered in the sand,"
3010,HOMER[F],"He called to all his friends, and prayed they would not in that strait"
3011,HOMER[F],"Forsake his nephew, but maintain about his corse the fight,"
3012,HOMER[F],And save it from the spoil of Greece.
3013,HOMER[F],
3014,HOMER[F],"The archery of Teucer, brother of Ajax, was dealing destruction among"
3015,HOMER[F],"the Trojans, when Jove broke the bow-string; and thereafter the god"
3016,HOMER[F],stirred
3017,HOMER[F],
3018,HOMER[F],With such addition of his spirit the spirit Hector bore
3019,HOMER[F],"To burn the fleet, that of itself was hot enough before."
3020,HOMER[F],"But now he fared like Mars himself, so brandishing his lance"
3021,HOMER[F],"As through the deep shades of a wood a raging fire should glance,"
3022,HOMER[F],Held up to all eyes by a hill; about his lips a foam
3023,HOMER[F],"Stood, as when th' ocean is enraged; his eyes were overcome"
3024,HOMER[F],"With fervour, and resembled flames, set off by his dark brows,"
3025,HOMER[F],And from his temples his bright helm abhorred lightnings throws.
3026,HOMER[F],"He, girt in fire borne for the fleet, still rushed at every troop,"
3027,HOMER[F],"And fell upon it like a wave, high raised, that then doth stoop"
3028,HOMER[F],"Out from the clouds, grows as it stoops with storms, then down doth"
3029,HOMER[F],"come And cuff a ship, when all her sides are hid in brackish foam,"
3030,HOMER[F],"Strong gales still raging in her sails, her sailors' minds dismay'd,"
3031,HOMER[F],Death being but little from their lives; so Jovelike Hector fray'd
3032,HOMER[F],"And plied the Greeks, who knew not what would chance, for all their"
3033,HOMER[F],"guards. And as the baneful king of beasts, leapt in to oxen herds Fed"
3034,HOMER[F],"in the meadows of a fen exceeding great, the beasts In number infinite,"
3035,HOMER[F],'mongst whom (their herdsmen wanting breasts To fight with lions for
3036,HOMER[F],"the price of a black ox's life) He here and there jumps first and last,"
3037,HOMER[F],"in his bloodthirsty strife; Chased and assaulted, and at length down in"
3038,HOMER[F],"the midst goes one, And all the rest 'sperst through the fen; so now"
3039,HOMER[F],all Greece was gone.
3040,HOMER[F],
3041,HOMER[F],On the Grecian side Ajax
3042,HOMER[F],
3043,HOMER[F],"Stalked here and there, and in his hand a huge great bead-hook held,"
3044,HOMER[F],"Twelve cubits long, and full of iron. And then again there grew"
3045,HOMER[F],A bitter conflict at the fleet. You would have said none drew
3046,HOMER[F],"A weary breath, nor ever did, they laid so freshly on."
3047,HOMER[F],
3048,HOMER[F],"It seemed that even Ajax would be overborne. But Patroclus, the loved"
3049,HOMER[F],"friend of Achilles, saw this destruction coming upon the Greeks, and"
3050,HOMER[F],"he earnestly besought Achilles, if he would not be moved to sally"
3051,HOMER[F],"forth to the rescue himself, to suffer him to go out against the"

4783,ACT II,"Oh, God, how false and vain"

4785,ACT II,
4786,ACT II,DOÑA SOL: When I refused the throne

5113,FOOTNOTES:,with a splendid lyrical inspiration; but he combines this in his plays
5114,FOOTNOTES:,"with an acquired but effective talent for stage-craft. ""Hernani"" is the"
5115,FOOTNOTES:,most famous play in the European literature of the nineteenth century.
5116,FOOTNOTES:,This is partly due to the fact that it was the first great romantic
5117,FOOTNOTES:,"drama given on the French stage. When it was produced, on February 25,"
5118,FOOTNOTES:,"1830, there was a fierce battle in the theatre between the followers"
5119,FOOTNOTES:,of the new movement and the adherents of the classic school of French
5120,FOOTNOTES:,playwriting. Little of the play itself was heard on the first night.
5121,FOOTNOTES:,The voices of the players were drowned in a storm of denunciations
5122,FOOTNOTES:,"from the classicists, and counter-cheers from the romanticists. The"

5126,FOOTNOTES:,"Nevertheless, ""Hernani"" is a fine, interesting, poetic melodrama, with"

5169,ACT I,"Of the incredible, mysterious flight"
5170,ACT I,Of Marion de Lorme?

5172,ACT I,"BRICHANTEAU:                       We have some news,"

5175,ACT I,GASSE: At Blois? You jest! The Queen of Beauty? Marion
5176,ACT I,In a place like this?
5177,ACT I,
5178,ACT I,BRICHANTEAU:                    Saverny was attacked
5179,ACT I,"Last night by footpads. They were killing him,"
5180,ACT I,"When a man beat them off, and took our friend"
5181,ACT I,Into a house.
5182,ACT I,
5183,ACT I,GASSE: But Marion de Lorme?
5184,ACT I,
5185,ACT I,BRICHANTEAU: It was her house. Saverny's rescuer
5186,ACT I,Was the young man with whom she is in love.
5187,ACT I,
5188,ACT I,ROCHEBARON: What is the man like?
5189,ACT I,
5190,ACT I,BRICHANTEAU: Ask Saverny that.

5208,ACT I,SAVERNY: Fair Marion de Lorme has left her house.

5210,ACT I,
5211,ACT I,GASSE: What was the man like?
5212,ACT I,
5213,ACT I,SAVERNY: I do not know. On entering the house
5214,ACT I,"I recognised sweet Marion, and began"

5216,ACT I,"And thank the man to whom I owed my life,"
5217,ACT I,"He knocked the candle over. I withdrew,"
5218,ACT I,Seeing I was not wanted. All I know
5219,ACT I,Is that his name is Didier.
5220,ACT I,
5221,ACT I,ROCHEBARON:                          It smacks
5222,ACT I,Of vulgar origin. To think a man
5223,ACT I,With such a name should carry Marion off--
5224,ACT I,"Marion, the queen of beauty and of love!"
5225,ACT I,
5226,ACT I,"SAVERNY: There may be men with greater names, but none"
5227,ACT I,"With greater hearts. To leap from Marion's arms,"
5228,ACT I,And fight with footpads for a stranger's life!
5229,ACT I,The thing's heroic! I owe Didier
5230,ACT I,"A debt that I would pay, if need there was,"
5231,ACT I,With all my blood. I wish he were my friend!

5238,ACT I,DIDIER: The Marquis of Saverny! So the fop
5239,ACT I,"Called himself. Oh, the easy, impudent air"
5240,ACT I,With which he spoke to Marie! And I saved

5249,ACT I,Of hanging?
5250,ACT I,

5397,ACT II,Can you not talk to me of death again?
5398,ACT II,That is a pleasant subject. Your gay talk

5584,ACT III,
5585,ACT III,DIDIER: How have you obtained

6435,ACT II,SCENE.--_A tumble-down inn on the outskirts of Paris by the edge of
6436,ACT II,the Seine. The scene is represented on the stage in a sort of
6437,ACT II,"section, so that the spectator sees everything that goes on in"
6438,ACT II,"the interior of the inn, as well as on the road outside."
6439,ACT II,"Besides this, the building is so cracked and ruined that any"
6440,ACT II,passer-by can see into the room through the holes in the wall.
6441,ACT II,It is night._ TRIBOULET _and his daughter appear in the road._
6442,ACT II,SALTABADIL _is sitting in the inn._
6443,ACT II,
6444,ACT II,"TRIBOULET: I will avenge you, Blanche."
6445,ACT II,
6446,ACT II,BLANCHE:                                He cannot be
6447,ACT II,False and untrue.
6448,ACT II,
6449,ACT II,"TRIBOULET (_whispering, as he leads her to a hole in the wall_):"
6450,ACT II,
6451,ACT II,"Come. See with your own eyes,"
6452,ACT II,What kind of man our great King François is.
6453,ACT II,
6454,ACT II,"BLANCHE (_whispering, as she sees only_ SALTABADIL):"
6455,ACT II,I only see a stranger.
6456,ACT II,
6457,ACT II,TRIBOULET:              Wait awhile.
6458,ACT II,
6459,ACT II,"[_As he whispers,_ KING FRANÇOIS _enters the room by a"

6464,ACT II,"[_She trembles, and follows with angry eyes the movements"
6465,ACT II,of_ THE KING.
6466,ACT II,
6467,ACT II,TRIBOULET: This is the man you wish to save.
6468,ACT II,
6469,ACT II,THE KING (_slapping_ SALTABADIL _on the back_):
6470,ACT II,Tell Maguelonne to bring me in some wine.
6471,ACT II,
6472,ACT II,"TRIBOULET: King by the grace of God he is, with all"
6473,ACT II,The wealth and splendour of the land of France
6474,ACT II,At his command; but to amuse himself
6475,ACT II,He drinks himself asleep in thieves' kitchens.
6476,ACT II,
6477,ACT II,THE KING (_singing while_ TRIBOULET _talks outside_):
6478,ACT II,"Oh, woman is fickle, and man is a fool"
6479,ACT II,To trust in her word!
6480,ACT II,"She changes without any reason or rule,"
6481,ACT II,As her fancies are stirred.
6482,ACT II,A weather-cock veering to every wind
6483,ACT II,Is constant and true when compared to her mind.
6484,ACT II,
6485,ACT II,[_While he sings_ MAGUELONNE _enters with a skin of
6486,ACT II,"wine._ SALTABADIL _goes out, and seeing_ TRIBOULET,"
6487,ACT II,_approaches him with an air of mystery._ BLANCHE
6488,ACT II,_continues to watch_ THE KING.
6489,ACT II,
6490,ACT II,SALTABADIL: We've caught our man! And now it rests with you
6491,ACT II,To let him live or die.
6492,ACT II,
6493,ACT II,TRIBOULET (_looking at_ BLANCHE): Wait for a while.
6494,ACT II,
6495,ACT II,THE KING (_to_ MAGUELONNE): Life is a flower and love the honey
6496,ACT II,of life;
6497,ACT II,"Come, let us taste it, mouth to mouth, my sweet."
6498,ACT II,
6499,ACT II,"[_He tries to kiss her, but she escapes._"
6500,ACT II,
6501,ACT II,MAGUELONNE: You got that from a book.
6502,ACT II,
6503,ACT II,"THE KING:                       Your dark, sweet eyes"
6504,ACT II,Inspired me! It was only yesterday
6505,ACT II,"We met at the Hôtel du Maine, and yet"
6506,ACT II,I love you with as passionate a love
6507,ACT II,As if we had been sweethearts all our lives.
6508,ACT II,"Come, let me kiss you!"
6509,ACT II,
6510,ACT II,MAGUELONNE (_sitting herself gaily on the table where
6511,ACT II,he is drinking_): When you have drunk your wine.
6512,ACT II,
6513,ACT II,"[THE KING _empties the flagon of drugged liquor, and"
6514,ACT II,with a mocking laugh the girl jumps down and sits
6515,ACT II,on his knee._
6516,ACT II,
6517,ACT II,"THE KING: Oh, you delicious, fascinating thing."
6518,ACT II,What a wild dance you've led me! Feel my heart
6519,ACT II,Seating with love for you!
6520,ACT II,
6521,ACT II,MAGUELONNE:                 And for a score
6522,ACT II,Of other women!
6523,ACT II,
6524,ACT II,"THE KING: No, for you alone!"
6525,ACT II,
6526,ACT II,[BLANCHE _cannot bear to look at them any longer. Pale

6528,ACT II,father's arms._
6529,ACT II,
6530,ACT II,"BLANCHE: Oh, God, how he deceived me! My heart breaks."
6531,ACT II,All that he said to me he now repeats
6532,ACT II,"To this low, shameless slut. He is a man"
6533,ACT II,Without a soul.
6534,ACT II,
6535,ACT II,"TRIBOULET (_in a whisper_): Hush, hush! or he will hear!"
6536,ACT II,You leave him in my hands then?
6537,ACT II,
6538,ACT II,BLANCHE:                        What is it
6539,ACT II,You mean to do?
6540,ACT II,
6541,ACT II,TRIBOULET:      Avenge you and myself!
6542,ACT II,Run home and dress yourself in the boy's clothes
6543,ACT II,"Prepared for you. Take all the gold you find,"
6544,ACT II,"And ride to Evreux, and there wait for me."
6545,ACT II,
6546,ACT II,"BLANCHE (_entreatingly_): Come with me, father!"
6547,ACT II,
6548,ACT II,"TRIBOULET (_sternly_):         I have work to do,"
6549,ACT II,"Terrible work! Do not return for me,"
6550,ACT II,But ride your horse as fast as it will go.
6551,ACT II,
6552,ACT II,BLANCHE:                                    I am afraid.
6553,ACT II,
6554,ACT II,"TRIBOULET:: Obey me, Blanche! Good-bye!"
6555,ACT II,
6556,ACT II,"[_He kisses her, and she staggers away._ TRIBOULET _then"
6557,ACT II,"signs to_ SALTABADIL, _who comes running up, and"
6558,ACT II,gives him ten crowns in gold._
6559,ACT II,
6560,ACT II,TRIBOULET: Here is half of the sum. I'll bring the rest
6561,ACT II,When you hand me the body in a sack.
6562,ACT II,
6563,ACT II,SALTABADIL: It shall be done to-night.
6564,ACT II,
6565,ACT II,"TRIBOULET: At midnight, then."
6566,ACT II,
6567,ACT II,"[_He goes in. During this scene outside, the drowsy_"
6568,ACT II,KING _has been flirting with_ MAGUELONNE. _She
6569,ACT II,jumps off his knee as_ SALTABADIL _enters._ TRIBOULET
6570,ACT II,_departs._
6571,ACT II,
6572,ACT II,SALTABADIL: What a wild night! The rain is pouring down
6573,ACT II,In torrents.
6574,ACT II,
6575,ACT II,THE KING (_sleepily_): You must find me a bed.
6576,ACT II,
6577,ACT II,MAGUELONNE (_in a fierce whisper_): Go! Go!
6578,ACT II,
6579,ACT II,"THE KING: What? And be drowned? You are unkind, my sweet."
6580,ACT II,
6581,ACT II,SALTABADIL (_Whispering to his sister_):
6582,ACT II,Keep him here. We have twenty golden crowns
6583,ACT II,"To earn to-night. (_To_ KING FRANÇOIS) Sir, you can have my room."
6584,ACT II,
6585,ACT II,"THE KING: Ah, you are kinder than your sister is!"
6586,ACT II,Show me the bed.
6587,ACT II,
6588,ACT II,[SALTABADIL _takes the lamp and leads him upstairs._
6589,ACT II,
6590,ACT II,SALTABADIL: This way.

6592,ACT II,"MAGUELONNE (_in the darkness_): Poor, poor young man!"
6593,ACT II,
6594,ACT II,[SALTABADIL _returns with the lamp. He sits at the table
6595,ACT II,in silence; his sister watches him._

6597,ACT II,MAGUELONNE (_fiercely_): You must not kill him!
6598,ACT II,
6599,ACT II,SALTABADIL: Twenty golden crowns!
6600,ACT II,"Look, here are ten of them! The rest I get"
6601,ACT II,At midnight. Pest! There is no time to lose.
6602,ACT II,"Quick, sew this sack! My client will return"
6603,ACT II,In a few minutes.
6604,ACT II,
6605,ACT II,"[_Terrified by his look, she takes up the sack and begins"
6606,ACT II,"to mend it. There is again a silence, and in the"
6607,ACT II,sinister and momentary radiance of the lightning
6608,ACT II,the figure of_ BLANCHE _is seen approaching the inn.
6609,ACT II,"She is dressed in a man's clothes, and booted and"
6610,ACT II,spurred._
6611,ACT II,
6612,ACT II,BLANCHE: Terrible work to do! I cannot go.
6613,ACT II,"Father, I cannot! Oh, this horrible dream!"
6614,ACT II,Let me awake from it ere I go mad.
6615,ACT II,"This dream, this horrible dream!"
6616,ACT II,
6617,ACT II,"[_Seeing the light from the window, she totters up to the"
6618,ACT II,hole in the wall and looks in again._

6620,ACT II,God! it is true!
6621,ACT II,"There they are! There!--the man with murderous looks,"
6622,ACT II,The girl with shameless eyes! Where is the king?
6623,ACT II,
6624,ACT II,[_Her cries are drowned in the thunder._

6626,ACT II,MAGUELONNE: Brother!

6628,ACT II,SALTABADIL:             Yes.
6629,ACT II,
6630,ACT II,MAGUELONNE:                     Do not kill him.
6631,ACT II,
6632,ACT II,SALTABADIL:                     Ten more crowns!
6633,ACT II,
6634,ACT II,"MAGUELONNE: He is worth more than that. Handsome and young,"
6635,ACT II,"And noble too, I'll take my oath on it."
6636,ACT II,"Besides, he loves me."
6637,ACT II,
6638,ACT II,SALTABADIL:             Get on with the sack.
6639,ACT II,
6640,ACT II,MAGUELONNE: You only want the money. Take and kill
6641,ACT II,The little hunchback when he comes with it.
6642,ACT II,
6643,ACT II,BLANCHE: My father!
6644,ACT II,
6645,ACT II,SALTABADIL (_angrily_): What! Am I a common thief?
6646,ACT II,"Kill my own client? I will have you know,"
6647,ACT II,"My sister, that I am an honest man."
6648,ACT II,I do the work I'm paid for.
6649,ACT II,
6650,ACT II,"[_Drawing his dagger, he goes towards the stairs._"
6651,ACT II,
6652,ACT II,"MAGUELONNE (_barring the way_): Stop, I say!"
6653,ACT II,Or I will go and rouse him.
6654,ACT II,
6655,ACT II,"BLANCHE:                    Good, brave girl!"
6656,ACT II,
6657,ACT II,"SALTABADIL: Well, let us make a bargain, Maguelonne."
6658,ACT II,If anyone comes knocking at our inn
6659,ACT II,"By midnight, he shall go into the sack."
6660,ACT II,My client only wants to fling some corpse
6661,ACT II,"Into the river, and on this wild night"
6662,ACT II,He will not see what he is throwing in.
6663,ACT II,
6664,ACT II,MAGUELONNE: It is just on the hour. No one will come.
6665,ACT II,Cannot you ram this faggot in the sack?
6666,ACT II,
6667,ACT II,SALTABADIL: Who would take that for a limp body?  No!
6668,ACT II,Either a traveller or the man upstairs.
6669,ACT II,That is all! Will you take the chance?
6670,ACT II,
6671,ACT II,MAGUELONNE (_weeping_):               I must.
6672,ACT II,
6673,ACT II,"BLANCHE: Oh, God, I cannot! No! I am too young."
6674,ACT II,He does not love me.

6682,ACT II,BLANCHE (_stumbling to the door_):
6683,ACT II,"My father hates him.... Perhaps it will not hurt,"
6684,ACT II,If they strike hard and kill me at a blow.
6685,ACT II,"Oh, if he only loved me!"
6686,ACT II,
6687,ACT II,MAGUELONNE (_opening the door_): Who is there?
6688,ACT II,
6689,ACT II,BLANCHE: Give me a shelter for the night.

6829,FOOTNOTES:,[L] Victor Hugo was a man with a remarkable aptitude for
6830,FOOTNOTES:,divining the real course of popular feeling and giving violent
6831,FOOTNOTES:,expression to it. It was this that made him one of the leaders of the
6832,FOOTNOTES:,modern republican movement in France. Precluded by his earlier works
6833,FOOTNOTES:,"from attacking the monarchy openly, he set about discrediting it by"
6834,FOOTNOTES:,a series of historical plays in which the French kings were depicted
6835,FOOTNOTES:,"in a sinister light. In ""Marion de Lorme"" he holds up the weakest of"
6836,FOOTNOTES:,"the Bourbons to bitter contempt; in ""The King Amuses Himself"" (""Le roi"
6837,FOOTNOTES:,"s'amuse""), produced in 1832, he satirises the most brilliant of the"
6838,FOOTNOTES:,Valois--François I. The portrait is a clever but one-sided piece of
6839,FOOTNOTES:,work; it is based on facts; but not on all the facts. It is true that
6840,FOOTNOTES:,"François used to frequent low taverns and mix in disreputable company,"
6841,FOOTNOTES:,"but he was also the most chivalrous king of his age, and a man of fine"
6842,FOOTNOTES:,"tastes in art and letters. Nevertheless, the play is one of the best"
6843,FOOTNOTES:,of Victor Hugo's by reason of the strange and terrible character of
6844,FOOTNOTES:,"the king's jester, Triboulet. This ugly little hunchback is surely a"
6845,FOOTNOTES:,memorable figure in literature. The horror and pity which he excites
6846,FOOTNOTES:,"as he sits by the river in the storm and darkness, rejoicing in the"
6847,FOOTNOTES:,"consummation of his scheme of revenge, have something of that awfulness"
6848,FOOTNOTES:,which is the note of veritable tragedy. The scene is a superb example
6849,FOOTNOTES:,of dramatic irony.

7548,ACT I,you have come to me now. I'd begun to be so afraid--so

7642,ACT II,SOLNESS: H'm! Haven't thought much about it.
7643,ACT II,
7644,ACT II,HILDA: Yes it does. Why should she talk in that
7645,ACT II,way? She might have said something really warm and
7646,ACT II,"cordial, you understand."
7647,ACT II,
7648,ACT II,SOLNESS: Is that how you'd like to have it?
7649,ACT II,
7650,ACT II,"HILDA: Yes, precisely. (_She wanders over to the"
7651,ACT II,table and looks over_ RAGNAR'S _portfolio of drawings_.)
7652,ACT II,Are all these drawings yours?
7653,ACT II,
7654,ACT II,SOLNESS: No; they're drawn by a young man I employ.
7655,ACT II,
7656,ACT II,HILDA (_sits down_): Then I suppose he's frightfully
7657,ACT II,clever.
7658,ACT II,
7659,ACT II,"SOLNESS: Oh, he's not bad, for my purpose."
7660,ACT II,
7661,ACT II,HILDA: I can't understand why you should be so
7662,ACT II,stupid as to go about teaching people. No one but yourself
7663,ACT II,should be allowed to build.
7664,ACT II,
7665,ACT II,SOLNESS: I keep brooding on that very thought.
7666,ACT II,(_Calling her to the window_) Look over there; that's
7667,ACT II,my new house.
7668,ACT II,
7669,ACT II,HILDA: It seems to have a tremendously high tower.
7670,ACT II,"Are there nurseries in _that_ house, too?"
7671,ACT II,
7672,ACT II,SOLNESS: Three--as there are here. But there will
7673,ACT II,"never be any child in them. We have had children,"
7674,ACT II,"Aline and I, but we didn't keep them long, our two"
7675,ACT II,little boys. The fright Aline got when our old house
7676,ACT II,"was burnt down affected her health, and she failed to"
7677,ACT II,rear them. Yet that fire made me. I built no more
7678,ACT II,"churches; but cosy, comfortable homes for human beings."
7679,ACT II,But my position as an artist has been paid for in Aline's
7680,ACT II,happiness. I could have prevented that fire by seeing to
7681,ACT II,a flue. But I didn't. And yet the flue didn't actually
7682,ACT II,cause the fire. Yet it was my fault in a certain sense.
7683,ACT II,
7684,ACT II,HILDA: I'm afraid you must be--ill.
7685,ACT II,
7686,ACT II,SOLNESS: I don't think I'll ever be quite of sound
7687,ACT II,mind on that point.
7688,ACT II,
7689,ACT II,"[RAGNAR _enters, and begs a few kind words about his"
7690,ACT II,"drawings to cheer his father, who is dying_. SOLNESS"
7691,ACT II,"_dismisses him almost brutally, and bids him never"
7692,ACT II,think of building on his own account_.
7693,ACT II,
7694,ACT II,HILDA (_when_ RAGNAR _has gone_): That was horribly
7695,ACT II,ugly--and hard and bad and cruel as well.
7696,ACT II,
7697,ACT II,"SOLNESS: Oh, you don't understand my position,"
7698,ACT II,"which I've paid so dear for. _(Confidentially)_ Hilda,"
7699,ACT II,don't you agree with me that there exists special chosen
7700,ACT II,"people, who have the power of desiring, _craving_ a thing,"
7701,ACT II,until at last it _has_ to happen? And aren't there helpers
7702,ACT II,and servers who must do their part too? But they never
7703,ACT II,"come of themselves. One has to call them very persistently,"
7704,ACT II,inwardly. So the fire happened conveniently
7705,ACT II,for me; but the two little boys and Aline were sacrificed.
7706,ACT II,She will never be the woman she longed to be.
7707,ACT II,
7708,ACT II,HILDA: I believe you have a sickly conscience. I
7709,ACT II,should like your conscience to be thoroughly robust.
7710,ACT II,
7711,ACT II,SOLNESS: Is _yours_ robust?
7712,ACT II,
7713,ACT II,HILDA: I think it is.
7714,ACT II,
7715,ACT II,SOLNESS: I think the Vikings had robust consciences.
7716,ACT II,"And the women they used to carry off had robust consciences,"
7717,ACT II,too. They often wouldn't leave their captors
7718,ACT II,on any account.
7719,ACT II,HILDA: These women I can understand exceedingly
7720,ACT II,well.
7721,ACT II,
7722,ACT II,SOLNESS: Could you come to love a man like that?
7723,ACT II,
7724,ACT II,HILDA: One can't choose whom one's going to love.
7725,ACT II,
7726,ACT II,"SOLNESS: Hilda, there's something of the bird of prey"
7727,ACT II,in you!
7728,ACT II,
7729,ACT II,HILDA: And why not? Why shouldn't I go a-hunting
7730,ACT II,"as well as the rest? Tell me, Mr. Solness, have you"
7731,ACT II,"never called me to you--inwardly, you know?"
7732,ACT II,
7733,ACT II,SOLNESS _(softly)_: I almost think I must have.
7734,ACT II,
7735,ACT II,HILDA: What did you want with me?
7736,ACT II,
7737,ACT II,"SOLNESS: You are the younger generation, Hilda."
7738,ACT II,
7739,ACT II,HILDA: Which you fear so much----
7740,ACT II,
7741,ACT II,"SOLNESS: Towards which, in my heart, I yearn so"
7742,ACT II,deeply.
7743,ACT II,
7744,ACT II,[_In the next scene_ HILDA _compels_ SOLNESS _to write a
7745,ACT II,"few kind words on_ RAGNAR'S _drawings, and send"
7746,ACT II,"them to_ BROVIK. _He entrusts the portfolio to_ KAIA,"
7747,ACT II,_and thereupon dismisses her and_ RAGNAR _from his
7748,ACT II,service._ MRS. SOLNESS _re-enters._
7749,ACT II,
7750,ACT II,"MRS. SOLNESS: Are you really dismissing them, Halvard?"
7751,ACT II,
7752,ACT II,SOLNESS: Yes.
7753,ACT II,
7754,ACT II,MRS. SOLNESS: Her as well?
7755,ACT II,
7756,ACT II,SOLNESS: Wasn't that what you wished?
7757,ACT II,
7758,ACT II,MRS. SOLNESS: But how can you get on without
7759,ACT II,"_her_----? Oh, no doubt you've someone else in reserve,"
7760,ACT II,Halvard.
7761,ACT II,
7762,ACT II,"HILDA _(playfully)_: Well, _I_ for one am not the person"
7763,ACT II,to stand at that desk.
7764,ACT II,
7765,ACT II,"SOLNESS: Never mind, never mind. It'll be all right,"
7766,ACT II,Aline. Now for moving into our new home--as quickly
7767,ACT II,as we can. This evening we'll hang up the wreath--right
7768,ACT II,on the pinnacle of the tower. What do you say to
7769,ACT II,"that, Hilda?"
7770,ACT II,
7771,ACT II,HILDA _(with sparkling eyes_): It'll be splendid to see
7772,ACT II,you up so high once more.
7773,ACT II,"MRS. SOLNESS: For heaven's sake, don't, Miss Wangel."
7774,ACT II,My husband!--when he always gets so dizzy.
7775,ACT II,
7776,ACT II,HILDA: He--dizzy? I've seen him with my own eyes
7777,ACT II,at the top of a high church tower.
7778,ACT II,
7779,ACT II,MRS. SOLNESS: Impossible!
7780,ACT II,
7781,ACT II,"SOLNESS: True, all the same."
7782,ACT II,
7783,ACT II,"MRS. SOLNESS: You, who can't even go out on the"
7784,ACT II,second-floor balcony?
7785,ACT II,
7786,ACT II,SOLNESS: You will see something different this evening.
7787,ACT II,
7788,ACT II,"MRS. SOLNESS: You're ill, you're ill! I'll write at"
7789,ACT II,"once to the doctor. Oh, God, Oh, God!"
7790,ACT II,
7791,ACT II,[_She goes out._
7792,ACT II,
7793,ACT II,"HILDA: Don't tell me _my_ master builder daren't, _cannot_"
7794,ACT II,"climb as high as he builds. You promised me a kingdom,"
7795,ACT II,and then you went and--well! Don't tell me you
7796,ACT II,can ever be dizzy!
7797,ACT II,
7798,ACT II,"SOLNESS: This evening, then, we'll hang up the wreath,"
7799,ACT II,Princess Hilda.
7800,ACT II,
7801,ACT II,HILDA (_bitterly_): Over your new home--yes.
7802,ACT II,
7803,ACT II,"SOLNESS: Over the new house, which will never be a"
7804,ACT II,_home_ for _me_.
7805,ACT II,
7806,ACT II,HILDA (_looks straight in front of her with a far-away
7807,ACT II,"expression, and whispers to herself. The only words"
7808,ACT II,audible are_): Frightfully thrilling----
7809,ACT II,
7810,ACT II,
7811,ACT III,ACT III
7812,ACT III,
7813,ACT III,"SCENE.--_A large, broad verandah attached to_ SOLNESS'S"
7814,ACT III,_dwelling-house. A flight of steps leads down to the garden
7815,ACT III,"below. Far to the right, among the trees, is a glimpse of"
7816,ACT III,"the new villa, with scaffolding round the tower. Evening"
7817,ACT III,"sky, with sun-lit clouds._"
7818,ACT III,
7819,ACT III,"MRS. SOLNESS: Have you been round the garden, Miss"
7820,ACT III,Wangel?
7821,ACT III,
7822,ACT III,"HILDA: Yes, and I've found heaps of flowers."
7823,ACT III,
7824,ACT III,"MRS. SOLNESS: Are there, really? You see, I seldom"
7825,ACT III,go there. I don't feel that it is _mine_ any longer. They've
7826,ACT III,"parcelled it out and built houses for strangers, who can"
7827,ACT III,look in upon me from their windows.
7828,ACT III,
7829,ACT III,HILDA: Mrs. Solness--may I stay here with you a
7830,ACT III,little?
7831,ACT III,
7832,ACT III,"MRS. SOLNESS: Yes, by all means, if you care to; but"
7833,ACT III,I thought you wanted to go in to my husband--to help
7834,ACT III,him?
7835,ACT III,
7836,ACT III,"HILDA: No, thanks. Besides, he's not in. He's with"
7837,ACT III,"the men over there. He looked so fierce, I didn't dare"
7838,ACT III,to talk to him.
7839,ACT III,
7840,ACT III,MRS. SOLNESS: He's so kind and gentle in reality.
7841,ACT III,
7842,ACT III,HILDA: _He_------
7843,ACT III,
7844,ACT III,"MRS. SOLNESS: You don't really know him yet, Miss"
7845,ACT III,Wangel.
7846,ACT III,
7847,ACT III,HILDA: Are you pleased about the new house?
7848,ACT III,
7849,ACT III,MRS. SOLNESS: It's what Halvard wants. It's simply
7850,ACT III,my duty to submit myself to _him_.
7851,ACT III,
7852,ACT III,"HILDA: That must be difficult, indeed, when one has"
7853,ACT III,gone through so much as you have--the loss of your two
7854,ACT III,little boys------
7855,ACT III,
7856,ACT III,MRS. SOLNESS: One must bow to Providence and be
7857,ACT III,"thankful, too."
7858,ACT III,
7859,ACT III,[DR. HERDAL _enters and goes in again with_ MRS. SOLNESS.
7860,ACT III,_She wishes to talk to him about her husband's mad
7861,ACT III,scheme. As they go_ SOLNESS _enters_.
7862,ACT III,
7863,ACT III,SOLNESS: Poor Aline! I suppose she was talking
7864,ACT III,about the two little boys? (HILDA _shudders_) Poor
7865,ACT III,"Aline, she will never get over it."
7866,ACT III,
7867,ACT III,HILDA: I am going away.
7868,ACT III,
7869,ACT III,SOLNESS: I won't allow you to. I wish you simply to
7870,ACT III,"_be_ here, Hilda."
7871,ACT III,
7872,ACT III,"HILDA: Oh, thank you. You know it wouldn't end"
7873,ACT III,there. That's why I'm going. You have duties to _her_.
7874,ACT III,Live for those duties.
7875,ACT III,
7876,ACT III,"SOLNESS: Too late! Those powers--devils, if you"
7877,ACT III,"will!--and the troll within me as well, have drawn the"
7878,ACT III,life-blood out of her. I'm chained alive to a dead
7879,ACT III,"woman!--(_in wild anguish_) _I--I_, who cannot live without"
7880,ACT III,joy in life.
7881,ACT III,
7882,ACT III,HILDA: What will you build next?
7883,ACT III,
7884,ACT III,SOLNESS (_shaking his head_): Not much more.
7885,ACT III,
7886,ACT III,"HILDA (_with an outburst_): Oh, it seems all so foolish--not"
7887,ACT III,"to be able to grasp your own happiness, merely because"
7888,ACT III,someone you know happens to stand in the way----
7889,ACT III,
7890,ACT III,SOLNESS: If only one had the Viking spirit in life----
7891,ACT III,
7892,ACT III,HILDA: And the other thing? What was that?
7893,ACT III,
7894,ACT III,SOLNESS: A robust conscience.
7895,ACT III,
7896,ACT III,HILDA (_radiant_): I know what you're going to build
7897,ACT III,next.
7898,ACT III,
7899,ACT III,SOLNESS: What?
7900,ACT III,
7901,ACT III,HILDA: The castle--_my_ castle. Build it for me this
7902,ACT III,"moment. The ten years are up. Out with my castle,"
7903,ACT III,"Mr. Solness! It shall stand on a very great height, so"
7904,ACT III,that I can see far--far around. We shall build--we two
7905,ACT III,together--the very loveliest thing in all the world!
7906,ACT III,
7907,ACT III,"SOLNESS: Hilda, tell me what it is."
7908,ACT III,
7909,ACT III,"HILDA: Builders are such very, very stupid people----"
7910,ACT III,
7911,ACT III,SOLNESS: No doubt--but tell me what we two are to
7912,ACT III,build together?
7913,ACT III,
7914,ACT III,"HILDA: Castles in the air! So easy to build (_scornfully_),"
7915,ACT III,especially for builders who have a--a dizzy conscience.
7916,ACT III,
7917,ACT III,SOLNESS: We shall build one--with a firm foundation.
7918,ACT III,(RAGNAR _enters with the wreath_) Have _you_ brought
7919,ACT III,"the wreath, Ragnar? Then I suppose your father's better?"
7920,ACT III,Wasn't he cheered by what I wrote him?
7921,ACT III,
7922,ACT III,RAGNAR: It came too late--he was unconscious. He
7923,ACT III,had had a stroke.
7924,ACT III,
7925,ACT III,SOLNESS: Go home to him. Give _me_ the wreath.
7926,ACT III,
7927,ACT III,RAGNAR: You don't mean that you yourself--no--I'll
7928,ACT III,stop.
7929,ACT III,
7930,ACT III,"HILDA: Mr. Solness, I will stand here and look at you."
7931,ACT III,
7932,ACT III,[SOLNESS _takes the wreath and goes down through the
7933,ACT III,"garden._ MRS. SOLNESS, _in an agony of apprehension,"
7934,ACT III,re-enters and sends_ RAGNAR _to fetch her husband
7935,ACT III,back from the new building. She returns indoors._
7936,ACT III,
7937,ACT III,"SOLNESS (_re-entering_): Oh, it's _you_, Hilda! I was"
7938,ACT III,afraid it was Aline or the doctor that wanted me.
7939,ACT III,
7940,ACT III,HILDA: You're easily frightened. They say you're
7941,ACT III,afraid to climb about scaffoldings. Is it true you're
7942,ACT III,afraid?
7943,ACT III,
7944,ACT III,SOLNESS: Not of death--but--of retribution.
7945,ACT III,
7946,ACT III,HILDA: I don't understand that.
7947,ACT III,
7948,ACT III,"SOLNESS: Sit down, and I'll tell you something. You"
7949,ACT III,know I began by building churches. I'd been piously
7950,ACT III,"brought up. I thought it was the noblest task, pleasing"
7951,ACT III,to Him for Whom churches are built. Then up at Lysanger
7952,ACT III,I understood that He meant me to have no love
7953,ACT III,"and happiness of my own, but just to be a master builder"
7954,ACT III,for Him all my life long. That was why He took my
7955,ACT III,"little children! Then, that day, I did the impossible. I"
7956,ACT III,was able to climb up to a great height. As I stood hanging
7957,ACT III,"the wreath on the vane, I cried, ""O Mighty One, I"
7958,ACT III,"will be a free builder--I, too, in my sphere as Thou in"
7959,ACT III,Thine. I will build no more churches for Thee--only
7960,ACT III,"homes for human beings."" But _that_ is not worth six-pence,"
7961,ACT III,Hilda.
7962,ACT III,
7963,ACT III,HILDA: Then you will never build anything more?
7964,ACT III,
7965,ACT III,"SOLNESS: On the contrary, I'm just going to begin--the"
7966,ACT III,only possible dwelling-place for human happiness------
7967,ACT III,
7968,ACT III,HILDA: Our castles in the air.
7969,ACT III,
7970,ACT III,SOLNESS: Our castles in the air--yes.
7971,ACT III,
7972,ACT III,HILDA: Then let me see you stand free and high up
7973,ACT III,"(_passionately_). I will have you do it--just once more,"
7974,ACT III,"Mr. Solness. Do the _impossible_, once again."
7975,ACT III,
7976,ACT III,"SOLNESS: If I do, I will talk to Him once again up"
7977,ACT III,"there--""Mighty Lord, henceforth I will build nothing"
7978,ACT III,"but the loveliest thing in the world."""
7979,ACT III,
7980,ACT III,"HILDA (_carried away_): Yes--yes--yes! My lovely,"
7981,ACT III,lovely castle! My castle in the air!
7982,ACT III,
7983,ACT III,[_The others go out upon the verandah. The band of the
7984,ACT III,Masons' Union is heard_. RAGNAR _tells_ SOLNESS
7985,ACT III,_that the foreman is ready to go up with the wreath_.
7986,ACT III,SOLNESS _goes out. The others watch eagerly_.
7987,ACT III,
7988,ACT III,DR. HERDAL: There goes the foreman up the ladder.
7989,ACT III,
7990,ACT III,"RAGNAR: Why, but it's------"
7991,ACT III,
7992,ACT III,HILDA (_jubilant_): It's the master builder himself.
7993,ACT III,
7994,ACT III,"MRS. SOLNESS: Oh, my God! Halvard, Halvard! I"
7995,ACT III,must go to him!
7996,ACT III,
7997,ACT III,"DR. HERDAL (_holding her_): Don't move, any of you."
7998,ACT III,Not a sound.
7999,ACT III,
8000,ACT III,RAGNAR: I feel as if I were looking at something
8001,ACT III,utterly impossible.
8002,ACT III,
8003,ACT III,HILDA (_ecstatically_): It is the _impossible_ that he is
8004,ACT III,doing now. Can you see anyone else up there with him?
8005,ACT III,There is One he is striving with. I hear a song--a
8006,ACT III,"mighty song. He is waving to us. Oh, wave back."
8007,ACT III,Hurrah for Master Builder Solness!
8008,ACT III,
8009,ACT III,[_The shout is taken up. Then a shriek of horror. A
8010,ACT III,"human body, with planks and pieces of wood, is"
8011,ACT III,vaguely seen crashing down behind the trees_.
8012,ACT III,
8013,ACT III,HILDA: _My_ Master Builder!
8014,ACT III,
8015,ACT III,A VOICE: Mr. Solness is dead. He fell right into the
8016,ACT III,quarry.
8017,ACT III,
8018,ACT III,"RAGNAR: So, after all, he could not do it."
8019,ACT III,
8020,ACT III,HILDA: But he mounted right up to the top. And I
8021,ACT III,"heard harps in the air. (_Waves her shawl, and shrieks"
8022,ACT III,with wild intensity) My--my_ Master Builder!

8073,ACT I,"by the_ CONSUL, _is addressed by_ KRAP _at the door of the_"
8074,ACT I,CONSUL'S _room_.
8075,ACT I,
8076,ACT I,KRAP: I am ordered by the consul to tell you that you
8077,ACT I,must stop those Saturday talks to the workmen about the
8078,ACT I,injury that our new machines will do to them. Your
8079,ACT I,first duty is to this establishment. Now you know the
8080,ACT I,will of the consul.
8081,ACT I,
8082,ACT I,AUNE: The consul would have said it differently.
8083,ACT I,But I know I have to thank for this the American that
8084,ACT I,has put in for repairs.
8085,ACT I,
8086,ACT I,KRAP: That is enough. You know the consul's wishes.

8092,ACT I,the ladies_.
8093,ACT I,
8094,ACT I,RÖRLUND: This book forms a welcome contrast to the
8095,ACT I,hollowness and rottenness we see every day in the papers
8096,ACT I,"and magazines, which reflect the condition of the whited"
8097,ACT I,"sepulchres, the great communities to-day. Doubt, restlessness,"
8098,ACT I,and insecurity are undermining society.
8099,ACT I,
8100,ACT I,DINA: But are not many great things being accomplished?
8101,ACT I,
8102,ACT I,RÖRLUND: I do not understand what you mean by
8103,ACT I,great things.
8104,ACT I,
8105,ACT I,MRS. RUMMEL: Last year we narrowly escaped the
8106,ACT I,introduction of a railroad.
8107,ACT I,
8108,ACT I,MRS. BERNICK: My husband managed to block the
8109,ACT I,"scheme, but the papers, in consequence, said shameful"
8110,ACT I,"things about him. But we are forgetting, dear rector,"
8111,ACT I,that we have to thank you for devoting so much time
8112,ACT I,to us.
8113,ACT I,
8114,ACT I,RÖRLUND: Do you not all make sacrifices in a good
8115,ACT I,cause to save the lapsed and lost?
8116,ACT I,
8117,ACT I,HILMAR TÖNNESEN (_coming in with a cigar in his
8118,ACT I,"mouth_): I have only looked in in passing. Good-morning,"
8119,ACT I,"ladies! Well, you know Bernick has called a cabinet"
8120,ACT I,council about this railway nonsense again. When it is a
8121,ACT I,"question of money, then everything here ends in paltry"
8122,ACT I,material calculations.
8123,ACT I,
8124,ACT I,MRS. BERNICK: But at any rate things are better than
8125,ACT I,"formerly, when everything ended in dissipation."
8126,ACT I,
8127,ACT I,MRS. RUMMEL: Only think of fifteen years ago.
8128,ACT I,"What a life, with the dancing club and music club! I"
8129,ACT I,well remember the noisy gaiety among families.
8130,ACT I,
8131,ACT I,"MRS. LYNGE: There was a company of strolling players,"
8132,ACT I,"who, I was told, played many pranks. What was"
8133,ACT I,the truth of the matter?
8134,ACT I,
8135,ACT I,"Mrs. Rummel, when Dina is out of the room, explains to the ladies"
8136,ACT I,that the girl is the daughter of a strolling player who years before
8137,ACT I,"had come to perform for a season in the town. Dorf, the actor, had"
8138,ACT I,"deserted both wife and child, and the wife had to take to work to"
8139,ACT I,"which she was unaccustomed, was seized with a pulmonary malady, and"
8140,ACT I,died. Then Dina had been adopted by the Bernicks.
8141,ACT I,
8142,ACT I,"Mrs. Rummel goes on to explain that at that season also Johan, Mrs."
8143,ACT I,"Bernick's brother, had run away to America. After his departure it"
8144,ACT I,was discovered that he had been playing tricks with the cash-box of
8145,ACT I,"the firm, of which his widowed mother had become the head. Karsten,"
8146,ACT I,"now Consul, Bernick had just come home from Paris. He became engaged"
8147,ACT I,"to Betty Tönnesen, now his wife, but when he entered her aunt's room,"
8148,ACT I,"with the girl on his arm, to announce his betrothal, Lona Hessel rose"
8149,ACT I,"from her chair and violently boxed his ear. Then she packed her box,"
8150,ACT I,"and went off to America. Little had been heard of Lona, except that"
8151,ACT I,"she had in America sung in taverns, and had given lectures, and had"
8152,ACT I,written a most sensational book.

8158,CONSUL BERNICK.,CONSUL BERNICK.
8159,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8160,CONSUL BERNICK.,"BERNICK: I am not at all pleased, Aune, with the way"
8161,CONSUL BERNICK.,things are going on in the yard. The repairs are slow.
8162,CONSUL BERNICK.,The _Palm Tree_ should long since have been at sea.
8163,CONSUL BERNICK.,"That American ship, the _Indian Girl_, has been lying here"
8164,CONSUL BERNICK.,"five weeks. You do not know how to use the new machines,"
8165,CONSUL BERNICK.,or else you will not use them.
8166,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8167,CONSUL BERNICK.,"AUNE: Consul, the _Palm Tree_ can go to sea in two"
8168,CONSUL BERNICK.,"days, but the _Indian Girl_ is as rotten as matchwood in"
8169,CONSUL BERNICK.,"the bottom planking. Now, I am getting on for sixty,"
8170,CONSUL BERNICK.,and I cannot take to new ways. I am afraid for the
8171,CONSUL BERNICK.,many folk whom the machinery will deprive of a livelihood.
8172,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8173,CONSUL BERNICK.,BERNICK: I did not send for you to argue. Listen
8174,CONSUL BERNICK.,now. The _Indian Girl_ must be got ready to sail in two
8175,CONSUL BERNICK.,"days, at the same time as our own ship. There are reasons"
8176,CONSUL BERNICK.,for this decision. The carping newspaper critics
8177,CONSUL BERNICK.,are pretending that we are giving all our attention to the
8178,CONSUL BERNICK.,"_Palm Tree_. If you will not do what I order, I must"
8179,CONSUL BERNICK.,look for somebody who will.
8180,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8181,CONSUL BERNICK.,"AUNE: You are asking impossibilities, consul. But"
8182,CONSUL BERNICK.,"surely you cannot think of dismissing me, whose father"
8183,CONSUL BERNICK.,and grandfather worked here all their lives before me.
8184,CONSUL BERNICK.,Do you know what is meant by the dismissal of an old
8185,CONSUL BERNICK.,workman?
8186,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8187,CONSUL BERNICK.,"BERNICK: You are a stubborn fellow, Aune. You"
8188,CONSUL BERNICK.,oppose me from perversity. I am sorry indeed if we
8189,CONSUL BERNICK.,"must part, Aune."
8190,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8191,CONSUL BERNICK.,"AUNE: We will not part, consul. The _Indian Girl_"
8192,CONSUL BERNICK.,shall be cleared in two days.
8193,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8194,CONSUL BERNICK.,[AUNE _bows and retires._ HILMAR TÖNNESEN _comes
8195,CONSUL BERNICK.,through the garden gate._
8196,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8197,CONSUL BERNICK.,"HILMAR: Good-day, Betty! Good-day, Bernick."
8198,CONSUL BERNICK.,Have you heard the new sensation? The two Americans
8199,CONSUL BERNICK.,are going about the streets in company with Dina Dorf.
8200,CONSUL BERNICK.,The town is all excitement about it.
8201,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8202,CONSUL BERNICK.,BERNICK (_looking out into the street_): They are
8203,CONSUL BERNICK.,coming here. We must be sure to treat them well.
8204,CONSUL BERNICK.,They will soon be away again.
8205,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8206,CONSUL BERNICK.,[JOHAN _and_ LONA _enter. Presently all disperse into
8207,CONSUL BERNICK.,"the garden, and_ BERNICK _goes up to_ JOHAN."
8208,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8209,CONSUL BERNICK.,"BERNICK: Now we are alone, Johan, I must thank"
8210,CONSUL BERNICK.,"you. For to you I owe home, happiness, position, and"
8211,CONSUL BERNICK.,all that I have and am. Not one in ten thousand would
8212,CONSUL BERNICK.,have done all that you then did for me. I was the guilty
8213,CONSUL BERNICK.,one. On the night when that drunken wretch came home
8214,CONSUL BERNICK.,it was for Betty's sake that I broke off the entanglement
8215,CONSUL BERNICK.,"with Madame Dorf; but still, that you should act in such"
8216,CONSUL BERNICK.,a noble spirit of self-sacrifice as to turn appearances
8217,CONSUL BERNICK.,"against yourself, and go away, can never be forgotten"
8218,CONSUL BERNICK.,by me.
8219,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8220,CONSUL BERNICK.,"JOHAN: Oh, well, we were both young and thoughtless."
8221,CONSUL BERNICK.,"I was an orphan, alone and free, and was glad to get"
8222,CONSUL BERNICK.,away from office drudgery. You had your old mother
8223,CONSUL BERNICK.,"alive, and you had just engaged yourself to Betty, who"
8224,CONSUL BERNICK.,was very fond of you. We agreed that you must be
8225,CONSUL BERNICK.,"saved, and I was proud to be your friend. You had"
8226,CONSUL BERNICK.,"come back like a prince from abroad, and chose me for"
8227,CONSUL BERNICK.,your closest friend. Now I know why. You were
8228,CONSUL BERNICK.,making love to Betty. But I was proud of it.
8229,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8230,CONSUL BERNICK.,BERNICK: Are you going back to your American
8231,CONSUL BERNICK.,"farm? Not soon, I hope."
8232,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8233,CONSUL BERNICK.,JOHAN: As soon as possible. I only came over to
8234,CONSUL BERNICK.,please Lona. She felt homesick. You can never think
8235,CONSUL BERNICK.,"what she has been to me. You never could tolerate her,"
8236,CONSUL BERNICK.,"but to me she has been a mother, singing, lecturing, writing"
8237,CONSUL BERNICK.,to support me when I was ill and could not work.
8238,CONSUL BERNICK.,And I may as well tell you frankly that I have told her
8239,CONSUL BERNICK.,all. But do not fear her. She will say nothing. But
8240,CONSUL BERNICK.,who would have dreamt of your taking into your house
8241,CONSUL BERNICK.,"that little creature who played angels in the theatre, and"
8242,CONSUL BERNICK.,scampered about here? What became of her parents?
8243,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8244,CONSUL BERNICK.,BERNICK: I wrote you all that happened. The
8245,CONSUL BERNICK.,"drunken scoundrel, after leaving his wife, was killed in"
8246,CONSUL BERNICK.,a drinking bout. After the wife died it was through
8247,CONSUL BERNICK.,Martha that we took little Dina in charge.
8248,CONSUL BERNICK.,
8249,CONSUL BERNICK.,"To the amazement of the Bernicks and some others, Johan makes it known"
8250,CONSUL BERNICK.,"that he has asked Dina to be his wife, and that she has consented. To"
8251,CONSUL BERNICK.,"their further astonishment and annoyance, Lona declares her profound"
8252,CONSUL BERNICK.,"approval of this engagement. Moreover, Lona now challenges Bernick"
8253,CONSUL BERNICK.,to clear his soul of the lie on which he has stood for these fifteen
8254,CONSUL BERNICK.,"years. It is a three-fold lie--the lie towards Lona, then the lie"
8255,CONSUL BERNICK.,"towards Betty, then the lie towards Johan. But Bernick shrinks from"
8256,CONSUL BERNICK.,"the terrible shame that would come on him as one of the ""pillars of"
8257,CONSUL BERNICK.,"society."""

8263,ACT III,speaking to the_ CONSUL.
8264,ACT III,
8265,ACT III,"KRAP: The _Palm Tree_ can sail to-morrow, but as for"
8266,ACT III,"the _Indian Girl_, in my opinion she will not get far. I"
8267,ACT III,"have been secretly examining the bottom of the ship,"
8268,ACT III,where the repairs have been pushed on very fast. The
8269,ACT III,"rotten place is patched up, and made to look like new, for"
8270,ACT III,Aune has been working himself all night at it. There is
8271,ACT III,"some villainy at work. I believe Aune wants, out of"
8272,ACT III,"revenge for the use of the new machines, to send that"
8273,ACT III,ship to the bottom of the sea.
8274,ACT III,
8275,ACT III,"BERNICK: This is horrible. True, Aune is an agitator"
8276,ACT III,"who is spreading discontent, but this is inconceivable."
8277,ACT III,
8278,ACT III,"[KRAP _goes out, and presently_ LONA HESSEL _enters_."
8279,ACT III,
8280,ACT III,"BERNICK: Well, Lona, what do you think of me now?"
8281,ACT III,
8282,ACT III,LONA: Just what I thought before. A lie more or
8283,ACT III,less----
8284,ACT III,
8285,ACT III,BERNICK: I can talk to you more confidentially than
8286,ACT III,to others. I shall hide nothing from you. I had a part
8287,ACT III,in spreading that rumour about Johan and the cash-box.
8288,ACT III,But make allowance for me. Our house when I came
8289,ACT III,"home from my foreign tour was threatened with ruin,"
8290,ACT III,and one misfortune followed another. I was almost in
8291,ACT III,"despair, and in my distraction got into that difficulty"
8292,ACT III,which ended with the disappearance of Johan. Then
8293,ACT III,after you and he left various reports were spread. Some
8294,ACT III,folks declared that he had taken the money to America.
8295,ACT III,I was in such difficulty that I did not say a word to contradict
8296,ACT III,the rumours.
8297,ACT III,
8298,ACT III,LONA: So a lie has made you one of the pillars of
8299,ACT III,society.
8300,ACT III,
8301,ACT III,JOHAN (_entering_): I have come to tell you that I intend
8302,ACT III,"not only to marry Dina Dorf, but to remain here and"
8303,ACT III,to defy all these liars. Yesterday I promised to keep
8304,ACT III,"silence, but now I need the truth. You must set me free"
8305,ACT III,"by telling the truth, that I may win Dina."
8306,ACT III,
8307,ACT III,BERNICK (_in great agitation_): But just reflect on my
8308,ACT III,position. If you aim such a blow as this at me I am
8309,ACT III,ruined irretrievably. The welfare of this community is
8310,ACT III,"also at stake. If my credit is not impaired, I shall soon"
8311,ACT III,"be a millionaire, when certain company projects mature."
8312,ACT III,"Johan, go away, and I will share with you. I have"
8313,ACT III,"staked all I possess on schemes now about to mature, but"
8314,ACT III,"if my character is impaired, my utter ruin is inevitable."
8315,ACT III,
8316,ACT III,"To the surprise of Bernick, Johan announces that he will go to"
8317,ACT III,"America, but will shortly return for Dina, and that accordingly he"
8318,ACT III,"will sail next day in the _Indian Girl_, the captain having promised"
8319,ACT III,"to take him. He will sell his farm and be back in two months, and then"
8320,ACT III,the guilty one must take the guilt on himself.
8321,ACT III,
8322,ACT III,"JOHAN: The wind is good, and in three weeks I shall"
8323,ACT III,be across the Atlantic unless the _Indian Girl_ should go to
8324,ACT III,the bottom.
8325,ACT III,
8326,ACT III,BERNICK (_involuntarily starting_): Go to the bottom?
8327,ACT III,Why should she?
8328,ACT III,
8329,ACT III,"JOHAN: Yes, indeed, why?"
8330,ACT III,
8331,ACT III,BERNICK (_very softly_): Go to the bottom?
8332,ACT III,
8333,ACT III,"They separate, and Aune enters, and anxiously asks if Bernick is"
8334,ACT III,"positively determined that the American ship shall sail the next day,"
8335,ACT III,on pain of his dismissal. He replies that he supposes the repairs
8336,ACT III,"are properly finished, and therefore the _Indian Girl_ must sail. A"
8337,ACT III,"merchant steps in to say that the storm-signals have been hoisted,"
8338,ACT III,for a tempest is threatening. This gentleman says to Bernick that the
8339,ACT III,"_Palm Tree_ ought to start all the same, for she is a splendidly-built"
8340,ACT III,"craft, and she is only to cross the North Sea; but as for the _Indian"
8341,ACT III,"Girl_, such an old hulk would be in great peril. But Bernick evades"
8342,ACT III,"the remonstrance, and no alteration is made in the plans of procedure."
8343,ACT III,The ship is to sail.

8347,ACT IV,
8348,ACT IV,SCENE.--_The same garden-room. It is a stormy afternoon and growing
8349,ACT IV,dark_.
8350,ACT IV,
8351,ACT IV,Bernick is apprised that he is to be most honourably fêted by his
8352,ACT IV,"fellow citizens who are about to form a procession, and to parade"
8353,ACT IV,before his house with music. The proudest moment of his life is at
8354,ACT IV,hand. But the fact that the sea is running high outside the harbour
8355,ACT IV,is causing great agitation to the mind of Bernick. Lona looks in to
8356,ACT IV,say that she has been saying farewell to Johan. He has not changed his
8357,ACT IV,determination to sail. A strange incident happens. Little Olaf Bernick
8358,ACT IV,runs away from home to slip on board the ship and accompany his uncle
8359,ACT IV,to America.
8360,ACT IV,
8361,ACT IV,LONA: So the great hour has arrived. The whole
8362,ACT IV,town is to be illuminated.
8363,ACT IV,
8364,ACT IV,BERNICK (_pacing to and fro in agitation_): Yes.
8365,ACT IV,"Lona, you despise me."
8366,ACT IV,
8367,ACT IV,LONA: Not yet.
8368,ACT IV,
8369,ACT IV,BERNICK: You have no right to despise me. For you
8370,ACT IV,little realise how lonely I stand in this narrow society.
8371,ACT IV,"What have I accomplished, with all my efforts? We"
8372,ACT IV,who are considered the pillars of society are but its tools
8373,ACT IV,after all. Since you came home from America I have
8374,ACT IV,been keenly feeling all this. All this show and deception
8375,ACT IV,"gives me no satisfaction. But I work for my son, who"
8376,ACT IV,will be able to found a truer state of things and to be
8377,ACT IV,happier than his father.
8378,ACT IV,
8379,ACT IV,LONA: With a lie for its basis? Think what an
8380,ACT IV,heritage you are preparing for Olaf.
8381,ACT IV,
8382,ACT IV,BERNICK: Why did you and Johan come home to
8383,ACT IV,crush me?
8384,ACT IV,
8385,ACT IV,LONA: Let me just tell you that after all Johan will
8386,ACT IV,not come back to crush you. For he has gone for ever
8387,ACT IV,and Dina has gone also to become his wife.
8388,ACT IV,
8389,ACT IV,BERNICK (_amazed_): Gone--in the _Indian Girl_?
8390,ACT IV,
8391,ACT IV,LONA: They did not dare to risk their lives in that
8392,ACT IV,crazy tub. They are in the _Palm Tree_.
8393,ACT IV,
8394,ACT IV,Bernick rushes to his office to order the _Indian Girl_ to be stopped
8395,ACT IV,"in the harbour, but he learns that she already is out at sea. But"
8396,ACT IV,presently Hilmar comes to tell him that Olaf has run away in the
8397,ACT IV,_Indian Girl_. He cries out that the ship must be stopped at any cost.
8398,ACT IV,"Krap says it is impossible. Music is heard, for the procession is"
8399,ACT IV,"approaching. Bernick, in an agony of soul, declares that he cannot"
8400,ACT IV,"receive anyone. The whole street blazes with the illuminations, and"
8401,ACT IV,"on a great transparency on the opposite house gleams the inscription,"
8402,ACT IV,"""Long live Karsten Bernick, the Pillar of our Society!"""
8403,ACT IV,
8404,ACT IV,"BERNICK (_at the window, shrinking back_): I cannot"
8405,ACT IV,look at all this. Away with all these mocking words! I
8406,ACT IV,shall never see Olaf again.
8407,ACT IV,
8408,ACT IV,"MRS. BERNICK: You will see him again, Karsten, all"
8409,ACT IV,right. I have got him. Do you think a mother does not
8410,ACT IV,watch? I overheard a few words from our boy which
8411,ACT IV,set me on my guard. I and Aune went in the sailing
8412,ACT IV,boat from the yard and reached the _Indian Girl_ when she
8413,ACT IV,"was on the point of sailing, and he was soon discovered"
8414,ACT IV,hiding away.
8415,ACT IV,
8416,ACT IV,BERNICK: And is the ship under sail again?
8417,ACT IV,
8418,ACT IV,MRS. BERNICK: No. The darkness came on more
8419,ACT IV,"densely, the pilot was alarmed, and so Aune, in your"
8420,ACT IV,"name, took it on himself to order the ship to stay till"
8421,ACT IV,to-morrow.
8422,ACT IV,
8423,ACT IV,BERNICK: What an unspeakable blessing.
8424,ACT IV,
8425,ACT IV,KRAP: The procession is coming through the garden
8426,ACT IV,"gate, consul."
8427,ACT IV,
8428,ACT IV,"Rector Rörlund, at the head of the procession, makes a presentation to"
8429,ACT IV,"Bernick in the name of the committee, and expresses the public esteem"
8430,ACT IV,"and admiration for the consul's services to society. Bernick, to the"
8431,ACT IV,"astonishment of the audience, proceeds to make a full confession of"
8432,ACT IV,the duplicity and deceit of which he has been guilty. He unreservedly
8433,ACT IV,"places himself in the hands of the people, who quietly disperse."
8434,ACT IV,"Bernick at once finds that, whatever the people may think, he has"
8435,ACT IV,won the sympathy of all his own circle. Lona lays her hands on his
8436,ACT IV,"shoulder with the words, ""Brother-in-law, you have at last discovered"
8437,ACT IV,that the spirit of Truth and the spirit of Freedom are the real
8438,ACT IV,"Pillars of Society."""

8980,JUVENAL[Q],Shall this man's elegies and the other's play
8981,JUVENAL[Q],Unpunished murder a long summer day?
8982,JUVENAL[Q],
8983,JUVENAL[Q],The poet exclaims against the dreary commonplaces in contemporary
8984,JUVENAL[Q],"poetry, and against recitations fit to crack the very statues and"
8985,JUVENAL[Q],colonnades of the neighbourhood! But _he_ also underwent his training
8986,JUVENAL[Q],in rhetoric.
8987,JUVENAL[Q],
8988,JUVENAL[Q],"So, since the world with writing is possessed,"
8989,JUVENAL[Q],"_I'll versify in spite_, and do my best"
8990,JUVENAL[Q],To make as much wastepaper as the rest!
8991,JUVENAL[Q],
8992,JUVENAL[Q],"It may be asked, why write satire? The reason is to be found in the"
8993,JUVENAL[Q],ubiquitous presence of offensive men and women. It would goad anyone
8994,JUVENAL[Q],"into fury to note the social abuses, the mannish women, and the"
8995,JUVENAL[Q],wealthy upstarts of the imperial city.
8996,JUVENAL[Q],
8997,JUVENAL[Q],"When the soft eunuch weds, and the bold fair"
8998,JUVENAL[Q],"Tilts at the Tuscan boar with bosom bare,"
8999,JUVENAL[Q],When all our lords are by his wealth outvied
9000,JUVENAL[Q],"Whose razor on my callow beard was tried,"
9001,JUVENAL[Q],"When I behold the spawn of conquered Nile,"
9002,JUVENAL[Q],"Crispinus, both in birth and manners vile,"
9003,JUVENAL[Q],Pacing in pomp with cloak of purple dye--
9004,JUVENAL[Q],"I cannot keep from satire, though I try!"
9005,JUVENAL[Q],
9006,JUVENAL[Q],There is an endless succession of figures to annoy: the too successful
9007,JUVENAL[Q],"lawyer, the treacherous spy, the legacy-hunter. How one's anger blazes"
9008,JUVENAL[Q],when a ward is driven to evil courses by the unscrupulous knavery of a
9009,JUVENAL[Q],"guardian, or when a guilty governor gets a merely nominal sentence!"
9010,JUVENAL[Q],
9011,JUVENAL[Q],"Marius, who pilled his province, 'scapes the laws,"
9012,JUVENAL[Q],"And keeps his money, though he lost his cause:"
9013,JUVENAL[Q],"His fine begged off, contemns his infamy,"
9014,JUVENAL[Q],"Can rise at twelve, and get him drunk ere three--"
9015,JUVENAL[Q],"Enjoys his exile, and, condemned in vain,"
9016,JUVENAL[Q],"Leaves thee, victorious province, to complain!"
9017,JUVENAL[Q],"Such villainies roused Horace into wrath,"
9018,JUVENAL[Q],And 'tis more noble to pursue his path
9019,JUVENAL[Q],"Than an old tale of Trojan brave to treat,"
9020,JUVENAL[Q],"Or Hercules, or Labyrinth of Crete."
9021,JUVENAL[Q],
9022,JUVENAL[Q],It is no time to write fabulous epics when cuckolds connive at
9023,JUVENAL[Q],"a wife's dishonour, and when horse-racing ne'er-do-wells expect"
9024,JUVENAL[Q],commissions in the army. One is tempted to fill volumes in the open
9025,JUVENAL[Q],street about such figures as the forger carried by his slaves in a
9026,JUVENAL[Q],"handsome litter, or about the wealthy widow acquainted with the mode"
9027,JUVENAL[Q],of getting rid of a husband by poison.
9028,JUVENAL[Q],
9029,JUVENAL[Q],Wouldst thou to honours and preferment climb?
9030,JUVENAL[Q],"Be bold in mischief--dare some mighty crime,"
9031,JUVENAL[Q],"Which dungeons, death, or banishment deserves,"
9032,JUVENAL[Q],For virtue is but drily praised--and starves.
9033,JUVENAL[Q],"To crime men owe a mansion, park, and state,"
9034,JUVENAL[Q],Their goblets richly chased and antique plate.
9035,JUVENAL[Q],"Say, who can find a night's repose at need,"
9036,JUVENAL[Q],"When a son's wife is bribed to sin for greed,"
9037,JUVENAL[Q],"When brides are frail, and youths turn paramours?"
9038,JUVENAL[Q],"If nature can't, then wrath our verse ensures!"
9039,JUVENAL[Q],"Count from the time since old Deucalion's boat,"
9040,JUVENAL[Q],"Raised by the flood, did on Parnassus float:"
9041,JUVENAL[Q],"Whatever since that golden age was done,"
9042,JUVENAL[Q],"What human kind desires, and what they shun,"
9043,JUVENAL[Q],"Joy, sorrow, fear, love, hatred, transport, rage,"
9044,JUVENAL[Q],Shall form the motley subject of my page.
9045,JUVENAL[Q],And when could Satire boast so fair a field?
9046,JUVENAL[Q],"Say, when did vice a richer harvest yield?"
9047,JUVENAL[Q],When did fell avarice so engross the mind?
9048,JUVENAL[Q],Or when the lust of play so curse mankind?
9049,JUVENAL[Q],"O Gold, though Rome beholds no altar's flame,"
9050,JUVENAL[Q],"No temples rise to thy pernicious name,"
9051,JUVENAL[Q],"Such as to Victory, Virtue, Faith are reared,"
9052,JUVENAL[Q],"Or Concord, where the clamorous stork is heard,"
9053,JUVENAL[Q],"Yet is thy full divinity confessed,"
9054,JUVENAL[Q],"Thy shrine established here, in every breast."
9055,JUVENAL[Q],
9056,JUVENAL[Q],After a vigorous outburst against the degrading scramble among
9057,JUVENAL[Q],"impoverished clients for doles from their patrons, and a mordant"
9058,JUVENAL[Q],"onslaught upon the gluttony of the niggardly rich, Juvenal sees in his"
9059,JUVENAL[Q],age the high-water mark of iniquity.
9060,JUVENAL[Q],
9061,JUVENAL[Q],"Nothing is left, nothing for future times,"
9062,JUVENAL[Q],To add to the full catalogue of crimes:
9063,JUVENAL[Q],"Vice has attained its zenith; then set sail,"
9064,JUVENAL[Q],"Spread all thy canvas, Satire, to the gale."

9067,JUVENAL[Q],_II.--A Satire on Rome_
9068,JUVENAL[Q],
9069,JUVENAL[Q],"This sharp indictment is put in the mouth of one Umbricius, who is"
9070,JUVENAL[Q],represented as leaving his native city in disgust. Rome is no place
9071,JUVENAL[Q],"for an honourable character, he exclaims."
9072,JUVENAL[Q],
9073,JUVENAL[Q],"Here, then, I bid my much-loved home farewell."
9074,JUVENAL[Q],"Ah, mine no more! There let Arturius dwell,"
9075,JUVENAL[Q],"And Catulus; knaves, who, in truth's despite,"
9076,JUVENAL[Q],"Can white to black transform, and black to white."
9077,JUVENAL[Q],"Build temples, furnish funerals, auctions hold,"
9078,JUVENAL[Q],"Farm rivers, ports, and scour the drains for gold!"
9079,JUVENAL[Q],"But why, my friend, should _I_ at Rome remain?"
9080,JUVENAL[Q],_I_ cannot teach my stubborn lips to feign;
9081,JUVENAL[Q],"Nor when I hear a great man's verses, smile,"
9082,JUVENAL[Q],"And beg a copy, if I think them vile."
9083,JUVENAL[Q],
9084,JUVENAL[Q],"The worst feature is the predominance of crafty and cozening Greeks,"
9085,JUVENAL[Q],"who, by their versatility and diplomacy, can oust the Roman."
9086,JUVENAL[Q],
9087,JUVENAL[Q],I cannot rule my spleen and calmly see
9088,JUVENAL[Q],A Grecian capital--in Italy!
9089,JUVENAL[Q],"A flattering, cringing, treacherous artful race,"
9090,JUVENAL[Q],"Of torrent tongue, and never-blushing face;"
9091,JUVENAL[Q],"A Protean tribe, one knows not what to call,"
9092,JUVENAL[Q],"Which shifts to every form, and shines in all:"
9093,JUVENAL[Q],"Grammarian, painter, augur, rhetorician,"
9094,JUVENAL[Q],"Rope-dancer, conjurer, fiddler, and physician,"
9095,JUVENAL[Q],All trades his own your hungry Greekling counts;
9096,JUVENAL[Q],And bid him mount the sky--the sky he mounts!
9097,JUVENAL[Q],
9098,JUVENAL[Q],The insinuating flatteries of these aliens are so masterfully
9099,JUVENAL[Q],contrived that the blunt Roman has no chance against such a nation of
9100,JUVENAL[Q],actors.
9101,JUVENAL[Q],
9102,JUVENAL[Q],Greece is a theatre where all are players.
9103,JUVENAL[Q],"For, lo! their patron smiles--they burst with mirth;"
9104,JUVENAL[Q],"He weeps--they droop, the saddest souls on earth;"
9105,JUVENAL[Q],He calls for fire--they court the mantle's heat;
9106,JUVENAL[Q],"""'Tis warm,"" he cries--the Greeks dissolve in sweat!"
9107,JUVENAL[Q],
9108,JUVENAL[Q],"Besides, they are dangerously immoral. Their philosophers are"
9109,JUVENAL[Q],perfidious. These sycophant foreigners can poison a patron against a
9110,JUVENAL[Q],poor Roman client. This leads to an outburst against poverty and its
9111,JUVENAL[Q],disadvantages.
9112,JUVENAL[Q],
9113,JUVENAL[Q],"The question is not put, how far extends"
9114,JUVENAL[Q],"One's piety, but what he yearly spends."
9115,JUVENAL[Q],The account is soon cast up: the judges rate
9116,JUVENAL[Q],Our credit in the court by our estate.
9117,JUVENAL[Q],"Add that the rich have still a gibe in store,"
9118,JUVENAL[Q],And will be monstrous witty on the poor.
9119,JUVENAL[Q],
9120,JUVENAL[Q],This mournful truth is everywhere confessed--
9121,JUVENAL[Q],Slow rises worth by property depressed.
9122,JUVENAL[Q],"At Rome 'tis worse; where house-rent by the year,"
9123,JUVENAL[Q],And servants' bellies costs so devilish dear.
9124,JUVENAL[Q],
9125,JUVENAL[Q],It is a city where appearance beyond one's means must be kept up;
9126,JUVENAL[Q],"whereas, in the country one need never spend money even on a toga."
9127,JUVENAL[Q],"Everything has its price in Rome. To interview a great man, his"
9128,JUVENAL[Q],pampered lackeys must have a fee.
9129,JUVENAL[Q],
9130,JUVENAL[Q],Then there are risks in a great capital unknown in country towns.
9131,JUVENAL[Q],There are tumble-down tenements with the buttresses ready to give;
9132,JUVENAL[Q],there are top garrets where you may lose your life in a fire. You
9133,JUVENAL[Q],could buy a nice rustic home for the price at which a dingy hovel is
9134,JUVENAL[Q],"let in Rome. Besides, the din of the streets is killing. Rome is bad"
9135,JUVENAL[Q],"for the nerves. Folk die of insomnia. By day you get crushed, bumped,"
9136,JUVENAL[Q],and caked with mud. A soldier drives his hobnails into your toe. You
9137,JUVENAL[Q],may be the victim of a street accident.
9138,JUVENAL[Q],
9139,JUVENAL[Q],"Heavens! should the axle crack, which bears a weight"
9140,JUVENAL[Q],"Of huge Ligurian stone, and pour the freight"
9141,JUVENAL[Q],"On the pale crowd beneath, what would remain,"
9142,JUVENAL[Q],"What joint, what bone, what atom of the slain?"
9143,JUVENAL[Q],"The body, with the soul, would vanish quite,"
9144,JUVENAL[Q],"Invisible, as air, to mortal sight!"
9145,JUVENAL[Q],"Meanwhile, unconscious of their master's fate,"
9146,JUVENAL[Q],"At home they heat the water, scour the plate,"
9147,JUVENAL[Q],"Arrange the strigils, fill the cruse with oil,"
9148,JUVENAL[Q],And ply their several tasks with fruitless toil.
9149,JUVENAL[Q],"But he, the mangled victim, now a ghost,"
9150,JUVENAL[Q],"Sits pale and trembling on the Stygian coast,"
9151,JUVENAL[Q],"A stranger shivering at the novel scene,"
9152,JUVENAL[Q],"At Charon's threatening voice and scowling mien,"
9153,JUVENAL[Q],"Nor hopes a passage thus abruptly hurled,"
9154,JUVENAL[Q],Without his farthing to the nether world.
9155,JUVENAL[Q],
9156,JUVENAL[Q],In the dark there are equal perils.
9157,JUVENAL[Q],
9158,JUVENAL[Q],"Prepare for death if here at night you roam,"
9159,JUVENAL[Q],And sign your will before you sup from home.
9160,JUVENAL[Q],
9161,JUVENAL[Q],Lucky if people throw only dirty water from their windows! Be thankful
9162,JUVENAL[Q],to escape without a broken skull. A drunken bully may meet you.
9163,JUVENAL[Q],
9164,JUVENAL[Q],"There are who murder as an opiate take,"
9165,JUVENAL[Q],"And only when no brawls await them, wake."
9166,JUVENAL[Q],
9167,JUVENAL[Q],"And what chance have you, without attendants, against a street rough?"
9168,JUVENAL[Q],Then there is the burglar; and the criminal classes are regularly
9169,JUVENAL[Q],increased in town whenever the authorities grow active enough to clear
9170,JUVENAL[Q],the main Italian roads of bandits.
9171,JUVENAL[Q],
9172,JUVENAL[Q],The forge in fetters only is employed;
9173,JUVENAL[Q],Our iron-mines exhausted and destroyed
9174,JUVENAL[Q],In shackles; for these villains scarce allow
9175,JUVENAL[Q],Goads for our teams or ploughshares for the plough.
9176,JUVENAL[Q],"Oh, happy ages of our ancestors,"
9177,JUVENAL[Q],Beneath the kings and tribunician powers!
9178,JUVENAL[Q],"One jail did all the criminals restrain,"
9179,JUVENAL[Q],Whom now the walls of Rome can scarce contain.

9182,JUVENAL[Q],_III.--A Satire on the Vanity of Human Wishes_
9183,JUVENAL[Q],
9184,JUVENAL[Q],Look round the habitable world; how few
9185,JUVENAL[Q],"Know their own good; or, knowing it, pursue."
9186,JUVENAL[Q],"To headlong ruin see whole houses driven,"
9187,JUVENAL[Q],"Cursed with their prayers, by too indulgent heaven."
9188,JUVENAL[Q],
9189,JUVENAL[Q],"The several passions and aspirations of mankind, successively"
9190,JUVENAL[Q],"examined in the light of legend and history, prove how hollow, if not"
9191,JUVENAL[Q],"pernicious, are the principal objects of pursuit. Wealth is one of the"
9192,JUVENAL[Q],commonest aims.
9193,JUVENAL[Q],
9194,JUVENAL[Q],"But avarice spreads her deadly snare,"
9195,JUVENAL[Q],And hoards amassed with too successful care.
9196,JUVENAL[Q],"For wealth, in the black days, at Nero's word,"
9197,JUVENAL[Q],The ruffian bands unsheathed the murderous sword.
9198,JUVENAL[Q],Cut-throats commissioned by the government
9199,JUVENAL[Q],Are seldom to an empty garret sent.
9200,JUVENAL[Q],"The traveller freighted with a little wealth,"
9201,JUVENAL[Q],"Sets forth at night, and wins his way by stealth:"
9202,JUVENAL[Q],Even then he fears the bludgeon and the blade--
9203,JUVENAL[Q],"Starts in the moonlight at a rush's shade,"
9204,JUVENAL[Q],"While, void of care, the beggar trips along,"
9205,JUVENAL[Q],And to the robber's face will troll his song.
9206,JUVENAL[Q],
9207,JUVENAL[Q],"What would the ""weeping"" and the ""laughing"" sages of ancient Greece"
9208,JUVENAL[Q],have thought of the pageants of modern Rome? Consider the vanity of
9209,JUVENAL[Q],ambition. It is illustrated by the downfall of the powerful minister
9210,JUVENAL[Q],"Sejanus. On his overthrow, the fickle mob turned savagely upon his"
9211,JUVENAL[Q],statues.
9212,JUVENAL[Q],
9213,JUVENAL[Q],What think the people? They!
9214,JUVENAL[Q],"They follow fortune, as of old, and hate"
9215,JUVENAL[Q],With all their soul the victim of the state.
9216,JUVENAL[Q],Yet in this very hour that self-same crowd
9217,JUVENAL[Q],"Had hailed Sejanus with a shout as loud,"
9218,JUVENAL[Q],If his designs (by fortune's favour blessed)
9219,JUVENAL[Q],"Had prospered, and the aged prince oppressed;"
9220,JUVENAL[Q],"For since our votes have been no longer bought,"
9221,JUVENAL[Q],All public care has vanished from our thought.
9222,JUVENAL[Q],"Romans, who once with unresisted sway,"
9223,JUVENAL[Q],"Gave armies, empire, everything, away,"
9224,JUVENAL[Q],For two poor claims have long renounced the whole
9225,JUVENAL[Q],And only ask--the circus and a dole.
9226,JUVENAL[Q],
9227,JUVENAL[Q],"Would you rather be an instance of fallen greatness, or enjoy some"
9228,JUVENAL[Q],safe post in an obscure Italian town? What ruined a Crassus? Or a
9229,JUVENAL[Q],"Pompey? Or a victorious Cæsar? Why, the realisation of their own"
9230,JUVENAL[Q],soaring desires.
9231,JUVENAL[Q],
9232,JUVENAL[Q],Another vain aspiration covets fame in eloquence. But the gift
9233,JUVENAL[Q],of oratory overthrew the two greatest orators of Greece and
9234,JUVENAL[Q],Rome--Demosthenes and Cicero. If Cicero had only stuck to his bad
9235,JUVENAL[Q],"verses, he would never have earned Antony's deadly hatred by his"
9236,JUVENAL[Q],"""Second Philippic"" (see Vol. IX, p. 155)."
9237,JUVENAL[Q],
9238,JUVENAL[Q],"""I do congratulate the Roman state"
9239,JUVENAL[Q],"Which my great consulate did recreate!"""
9240,JUVENAL[Q],If he had always used such jingling words
9241,JUVENAL[Q],He might have scorned Mark Antony's swords.
9242,JUVENAL[Q],
9243,JUVENAL[Q],A different passion is for renown in war. What is the end of it all?
9244,JUVENAL[Q],"Only an epitaph on a tombstone, and tombstones themselves perish; for"
9245,JUVENAL[Q],even a tree may split them!
9246,JUVENAL[Q],
9247,JUVENAL[Q],"Produce the urn that Hannibal contains,"
9248,JUVENAL[Q],And weigh the paltry dust which yet remains.
9249,JUVENAL[Q],"AND IS THIS ALL? Yet THIS was once the bold,"
9250,JUVENAL[Q],"The aspiring chief, whom Afric could not hold."
9251,JUVENAL[Q],"Spain conquered, o'er the Pyrenees he bounds;"
9252,JUVENAL[Q],"Nature opposed her everlasting mounds,"
9253,JUVENAL[Q],Her Alps and snows. O'er these with torrent force
9254,JUVENAL[Q],"He pours, and rends through rocks his dreadful course."
9255,JUVENAL[Q],Already at his feet Italia lies.
9256,JUVENAL[Q],"Yet, thundering on, ""Think nothing done,"" he cries,"
9257,JUVENAL[Q],"""Till Rome, proud Rome, beneath my fury falls,"
9258,JUVENAL[Q],"And Afric's standards float without her walls!"""
9259,JUVENAL[Q],"But what ensued? Illusive glory, say."
9260,JUVENAL[Q],"Subdued on Zama's memorable day,"
9261,JUVENAL[Q],"He flies in exile to a petty state,"
9262,JUVENAL[Q],"With headlong haste; and, at a despot's gate,"
9263,JUVENAL[Q],"Sits, mighty suppliant, of his life in doubt,"
9264,JUVENAL[Q],Till the Bithynian monarch's nap be out!
9265,JUVENAL[Q],"Nor swords, nor spears, nor stones from engines hurled,"
9266,JUVENAL[Q],Shall quell the man whose frown alarmed the world:
9267,JUVENAL[Q],"The vengeance due to Cannæ's fatal field,"
9268,JUVENAL[Q],"And floods of gore, a poisoned ring shall yield!"
9269,JUVENAL[Q],"Fly, madman, fly! At toil and danger mock,"
9270,JUVENAL[Q],"Pierce the deep snow, and scale the eternal rock,"
9271,JUVENAL[Q],"To please the rhetoricians, and become"
9272,JUVENAL[Q],A declamation--for the boys of Rome!
9273,JUVENAL[Q],
9274,JUVENAL[Q],Consider next the yearning after long life.
9275,JUVENAL[Q],
9276,JUVENAL[Q],Pernicious prayer! for mark what ills attend
9277,JUVENAL[Q],"Still on the old, as to the grave they bend:"
9278,JUVENAL[Q],"A ghastly visage, to themselves unknown;"
9279,JUVENAL[Q],"For a smooth skin, a hide with scurf o'ergrown;"
9280,JUVENAL[Q],"And such a cheek, as many a grandam ape"
9281,JUVENAL[Q],In Tabraca's thick woods is seen to scrape.
9282,JUVENAL[Q],
9283,JUVENAL[Q],The old man rouses feelings of impatient loathing in those around him;
9284,JUVENAL[Q],his physical strength and faculties for enjoyment are gone. Even if
9285,JUVENAL[Q],"he remain hale, he may suffer harrowing bereavements. Nestor, Peleus,"
9286,JUVENAL[Q],and Priam had to lament the death of heroic sons; and in Roman history
9287,JUVENAL[Q],Marius and Pompey outlived their good fortune.
9288,JUVENAL[Q],
9289,JUVENAL[Q],"Campania, prescient of her Pompey's fate,"
9290,JUVENAL[Q],Sent a kind fever to arrest his date:
9291,JUVENAL[Q],"When lo! a thousand suppliant altars rise,"
9292,JUVENAL[Q],And public prayers obtain him of the skies.
9293,JUVENAL[Q],The city's fate and his conspired to save
9294,JUVENAL[Q],"His head, to perish near the Egyptian wave."
9295,JUVENAL[Q],
9296,JUVENAL[Q],"Again, there is the frequent prayer for good looks. But beauty is a"
9297,JUVENAL[Q],"danger. If linked with unchastity, it leads to evil courses. Even if"
9298,JUVENAL[Q],"linked with chastity, it may draw on its possessor the tragic fate"
9299,JUVENAL[Q],"of a Lucretia, a Virginia, a Hippolytus, or a Bellerophon. What is a"
9300,JUVENAL[Q],Roman knight to do if an empress sets her heart on him?
9301,JUVENAL[Q],
9302,JUVENAL[Q],"Amid all such vanities, then, is there nothing left for which men may"
9303,JUVENAL[Q],reasonably pray?
9304,JUVENAL[Q],
9305,JUVENAL[Q],"Say, then, shall man, deprived all power of choice,"
9306,JUVENAL[Q],Ne'er raise to Heaven the supplicating voice?
9307,JUVENAL[Q],Not so; but to the gods his fortunes trust.
9308,JUVENAL[Q],"_Their_ thoughts are wise, _their_ dispensations just."
9309,JUVENAL[Q],"What best may profit or delight they know,"
9310,JUVENAL[Q],And real good for fancied bliss bestow;
9311,JUVENAL[Q],With eyes of pity they our frailties scan;
9312,JUVENAL[Q],More dear to them than to himself is man.
9313,JUVENAL[Q],"By blind desire, by headlong passion driven,"
9314,JUVENAL[Q],For wife and heirs we daily weary Heaven;
9315,JUVENAL[Q],"Yet still 'tis Heaven's prerogative to know,"
9316,JUVENAL[Q],"If heirs, or wife, will bring us weal or woe."
9317,JUVENAL[Q],"But (for 'tis good our humble hope to prove),"
9318,JUVENAL[Q],"That thou mayst still ask something from above,"
9319,JUVENAL[Q],"Thy pious offerings to the temple bear,"
9320,JUVENAL[Q],"And, while the altars blaze, be this thy prayer:"
9321,JUVENAL[Q],"O THOU, who know'st the wants of human kind,"
9322,JUVENAL[Q],"Vouchsafe me health of body, health of mind;"
9323,JUVENAL[Q],"A soul prepared to meet the frown of fate,"
9324,JUVENAL[Q],And look undaunted on a future state;
9325,JUVENAL[Q],"That reckons death a blessing, yet can bear"
9326,JUVENAL[Q],"Existence nobly, with its weight of care;"
9327,JUVENAL[Q],"That anger and desire alike restrains,"
9328,JUVENAL[Q],"And counts Alcides' toils, and cruel pains,"
9329,JUVENAL[Q],"Superior far to banquets, wanton nights,"
9330,JUVENAL[Q],And all the Assyrian monarch's soft delights!
9331,JUVENAL[Q],"Here bound, at length, thy wishes. I but teach"
9332,JUVENAL[Q],"What blessings man, by his own powers, may reach."
9333,JUVENAL[Q],"THE PATH TO PEACE IS VIRTUE. We should see,"
9334,JUVENAL[Q],"If wise, O Fortune, nought divine in thee:"
9335,JUVENAL[Q],"But _we_ have deified a name alone,"
9336,JUVENAL[Q],And fixed in heaven thy visionary throne!

9371,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"before all worlds, by Whom all things in this visible creation were"
9372,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"made, descended to our earth as your Redeemer. Near Jerusalem, once"
9373,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"the city where God displayed His grace, the Divine Redeemer withdrew"
9374,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],from the multitude and sought retirement. On the side where the sun
9375,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"first gilds the city with its beams rises a mountain, whose summit He"
9376,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],had oft honoured with His presence when during the solitary night He
9377,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],spent the hours in fervent prayer.
9378,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9379,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Gabriel, descending, stands between two perfumed cedars and addresses"
9380,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Jesus.
9381,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9382,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Wilt Thou, Lord, here devote the night to prayer,"
9383,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Or weary, dost thou seek a short repose?"
9384,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Permit that I for Thine immortal head
9385,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],A yielding couch prepare. Behold the shrubs
9386,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"And saplings of the cedar, far and near,"
9387,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Their balmy foliage already show.
9388,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Among the tombs in which Thy prophets rest
9389,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],The cooling earth yields unmolested moss.
9390,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9391,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Jesus answered not, but regarded Gabriel with a look of divine"
9392,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"complacency. He went up to the summit, where were the confines of"
9393,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"heaven, and there prayed. Earth rejoiced at the renewal of her beauty"
9394,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"as His voice resounded and penetrated the gates of the deep, but"
9395,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],only He and the Eternal Father knew the whole meaning of the divine
9396,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"petition. As Jesus arose from prayer, in His face shone sublimity,"
9397,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"love, and resignation."
9398,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9399,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Now He and the Eternal Father entered on discourse mysterious and
9400,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"profound, obscure even to immortals; discourse of things which in"
9401,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],future ages should display to man the love of God. A seraph entered
9402,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"the borders of the celestial world, whose whole extent is surrounded"
9403,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],by suns. No dark planet approaches the refulgent blaze.
9404,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9405,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"There, central of the circumvolving suns,"
9406,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Heaven, archetype of every blissful sphere,"
9407,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Orbicular in blazing glory, swims,"
9408,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],And circumfuges through infinitude
9409,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"In copious streams, the splendour of the spheres."
9410,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Harmonious sounds of its revolving motion
9411,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Are wafted on the pinions of the winds
9412,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],To circumambient suns. The potent songs
9413,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Of voice and harp celestial intermingle
9414,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],And seem the animation of the whole.
9415,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9416,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Up to this sacred way Gabriel ascended, approaching heaven, which, in"
9417,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"the very centre of the assemblage of suns, rises into a vast dome."
9418,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"When the Eternal walks forth, the harmonic choirs, borne on the wings"
9419,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"of the wind to the borders of the sunny arch, chant His praise,"
9420,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"joining the melody of their golden harps. During the hymn the seraph,"
9421,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"as messenger of the Mediator, stood on one of the suns nearest heaven."
9422,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],The Eternal Father rewarded the choirs with a look of benignity and
9423,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"then beheld the Chief Seraph, whose name with God is _The Chosen_, and"
9424,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],by the heavenly host is called _Eloah_.
9425,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9426,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"The awful thunder seven times rolled forth,"
9427,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"The sacred gloom dispelling, and the Voice"
9428,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Divine gently descended: ""God is Love."
9429,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],E'er beings gently emanated I was Love.
9430,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Creating worlds, I ever was the same,"
9431,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],And such I am in the accomplishment
9432,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Of my profoundest, most mysterious deed."
9433,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],But in the death of the Eternal Son
9434,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Ye learn to know Me wholly--God, the Judge"
9435,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Of every world. New adoration then
9436,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Ye will to the Supreme of heaven address."""
9437,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9438,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"The seraph having descended to the altar of the earth, Adam, filled"
9439,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"with eager expectation, hastened to him. A lucid, ethereal body was"
9440,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"the radiant mansion of his blessed spirit, and his form was as lovely"
9441,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],as the bright image in the Creator's mind when meditating on the form
9442,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],of man in the blooming fields of Paradise. Adam approached with a
9443,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"radiant smile, which suffused over his countenance an air of ineffable"
9444,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"and sweetest dignity, and thus with impassioned accents he spoke."
9445,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9446,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Hail, blessed seraph, messenger of peace!"
9447,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Thy voice, resounding of thy message high,"
9448,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Has filled our souls with rapture. Son of God,"
9449,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Messiah, O that Thee I could behold,"
9450,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Behold Thee in the beauty of Thy manhood,"
9451,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],E'en as this seraph sees Thee in the form
9452,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Which Thy compassion prompted Thee to take
9453,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],My wretched progeny from death to save.
9454,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Point out to me, O seraph, show to me,"
9455,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Where my Redeemer walked, my loving Lord;"
9456,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Only from far I will His step attend.
9457,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9458,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Gabriel descends again to earth, the stars silently saluting him with"
9459,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"a universal morn. He finds Jesus placidly sleeping on a bare rock, and"
9460,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"after long contemplation, apostrophises all nature to be silent, for"
9461,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],her Creator sleeps.

9466,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"The morn descends over the forest of waving cedars, and Jesus"
9467,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],awakes. The spirits of the patriarchs see Him with joy from their
9468,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"solar mansion. Raphael, John's guardian angel, tells Jesus that this"
9469,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],disciple is viewing a demoniac among the sepulchres on the Mount of
9470,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Olives. He goes thither, and puts Satan to flight, who, returning to"
9471,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"hell, gives an account of what he knows of Jesus, and determines that"
9472,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],He shall be put to death. Satan is opposed by Abaddon. Another grim
9473,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],fiend speaks.
9474,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9475,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Then Moloch fierce approached, a martial spirit."
9476,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"From mountains and entrenchments huge he came,"
9477,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Which still he forms, thus the domains of hell"
9478,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"To fence, in case the Thundering Warrior e'er"
9479,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],(He thus the dread Eternal nominates)
9480,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"From heaven descending, should th' abyss molest."
9481,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],All before Moloch with respect retired.
9482,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"In sable armour clad, which to his pace"
9483,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Resounded, he advanced as does a storm"
9484,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Amid dark lowering clouds. The mountains shook
9485,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Before him, and behind, a trembling rock"
9486,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],In shattered fragments sunk. Thus he advanced
9487,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],And soon attained the first revolter's throne.
9488,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9489,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"After the council of fiends, all hell approves Satan's determination."
9490,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Satan and Adramelech return to earth to execute their design. Abaddon,"
9491,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"following them at a distance, sees at the gate of hell Abdiel, the"
9492,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"seraph who was once his friend, whom he addresses. But Abdiel ignoring"
9493,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"him, he presses forward, bewails the loss of his glory, despairs of"
9494,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"finding grace, and after vainly endeavouring to destroy himself,"
9495,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],descends to earth. Satan and Adramelech also advance to earth and
9496,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],alight on Mount Olivet.
9497,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9498,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],They both advanced and stormed against the Mount
9499,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Of Olives, the Redeemer there to find"
9500,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Assembled with His confidential friends.
9501,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Thus down into the vale destructive cars
9502,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Of battle roll, against th' intrepid chief"
9503,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Of the advancing and undaunted host.
9504,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Now brazen warriors throng from every point.
9505,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"The thundering crash of the encounter, clash"
9506,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Of sword and shield, a sullen iron din"
9507,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"O'er distant rocks resounds tow'rd heaven aloft,"
9508,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],And in the valley scatters death around.
9509,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9510,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Caiaphas assembles the Sanhedrim, and relates a vision which has"
9511,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"terrified him. He declares that Jesus must die, but counsels caution"
9512,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"as to the manner of the execution. Philo, a dreaded priest and"
9513,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Pharisee, steps forward, and with great vehemence pronounces the dream"
9514,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"of Caiaphas a mere empty fiction, yet joins in counselling the death"

9516,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],but that Jesus would abolish the priesthood altogether.
9517,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9518,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"So saying, Philo, with uplifted arms,"
9519,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Advanced in the assembly and exclaimed:
9520,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"""Spirit of Moses, reigning now in bliss,"
9521,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Whether in thy celestial robes thou art,"
9522,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Or whether thy yet mortal children now

9524,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Thou deign'st to visit. Solemnly

9532,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],The evil counsel is warmly opposed by Gamaliel and Nicodemus. Judas
9533,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],has a private conference with Caiaphas. The Messiah sends Peter
9534,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"and John into Jerusalem to prepare the Passover. Jesus, going to"
9535,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Jerusalem, is met by Judas. Jesus institutes a memorial of His death."
9536,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Judas goes out from the supper. Then Jesus prays for His disciples,"

9545,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9546,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],He soared on golden clouds and sang aloud:
9547,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"""Hail me, I was found worthy after Thee"

9549,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"At humble distance the Messiah's thoughts,"

9552,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],No finite being ever saw God's thoughts:
9553,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Yet I have been found worthy from afar,"

9561,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"How they will then behold those radiant wounds,"
9562,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],The splendid testimonies of Thy love

9586,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],The Messiah is seized and bound. The assembled priests are seized
9587,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"with consternation, but their fears are removed by the arrival of"
9588,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"successive messengers. Jesus being taken before Annas, Philo goes"
9589,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"thither and brings Him to Caiaphas. Portia, Pilate's wife, comes to"
9590,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],see Jesus. She approaches from the Procurator's palace near the hall
9591,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"of assembly, by an arcade lit by lamps."
9592,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9593,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Impelled by curiosity at last
9594,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"The great and wondrous Prophet to behold,"
9595,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"She to the high-priest's palace came in haste,"
9596,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Only few attendants being with her.
9597,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"And Portia saw Him Who awoke the dead,"

9600,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],With wondrous magnanimity stood forth
9601,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Resolved to act with greatness, unadmired,"
9602,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],To beings so degenerate still unknown.
9603,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],With fervid expectation and with joy
9604,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"She stood and gazed upon the Holy Man,"
9605,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"And saw how He, sublime with dignified"
9606,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Serenity, His base accusers faced."
9607,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9608,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],On false evidence of suborned witnesses Jesus is condemned. Eloah and
9609,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Gabriel discourse on the Saviour's sufferings.
9610,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9611,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],GABRIEL: Eloah! He at whose command the dead
9612,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Of the renewed creation shall arise,"
9613,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],The tempest of the resurrection shaking
9614,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"The earth around, that she with bearing throes"
9615,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Will yield the dust at His almighty call.
9616,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],He then with thunders and attendant hosts
9617,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Of angels and in terrors clad, that stars"
9618,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Before Him sink, will judge that sinful world."
9619,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9620,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"ELOAH: He said, Let there be light! And there was light."
9621,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Thou, Gabriel, sawest how at His command"
9622,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Effulgent beams rushed forth! With thought profound
9623,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"He still advanced: and lo, at His right hand"
9624,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Ten thousand times ten thousand beings bright
9625,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Collected, and an animating storm"
9626,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Advanced before Him. Then the suns
9627,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Rolled in their orbits! Then the harmony
9628,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Of morning spheres resounded round the poles.
9629,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],And then the heavens appeared!
9630,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9631,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],GABRIEL: And at His word
9632,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Eternal night sank far below the heavens!
9633,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Thou sawest, Eloah, how He stood on high"
9634,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"O'er the Profound. He spake again, and, lo,"

9636,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"And lay before Him, seeming ruins vast"
9637,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Of broken suns, or of a hundred worlds"
9638,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"To chaos crushed. He summoned then the flame,"
9639,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],And the nocturnal blaze rushed in the fields
9640,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Of everlasting death. Then misery
9641,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Existed, which from the depths ascended"
9642,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],In cries of anguish and despondency.
9643,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Then was created the infernal gulf!
9644,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],
9645,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Thus they communed. Portia no longer could
9646,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"The Blessed Saviour's sufferings behold,"
9647,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],And lone ascended to the palace roof.
9648,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"She stood and wrung her hands, her weeping eyes"
9649,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"To heaven uplifted, while she thus express'd"

9663,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Dost Thou delight from Thine Olympus, Lord,"
9664,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],To look on suffering virtue? Is to Thee
9665,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"The object sacred? To the heart of men,"
9666,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"That is not of humanity devoid,"
9667,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"It is most awful, wondrous, and endearing;"
9668,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"But He who formed the stars, can He admire"

9670,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],To admiration ever scope to give!
9671,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],Yet th' object must e'en to the God of Gods
9672,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],"Be sacred, else He never could permit"
9673,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],That thus the good and guiltless be oppress'd.

9675,FRIEDRICH KLOPSTOCK[R],But thou discernest suffering virtue's tears

9713,FOOTNOTES:,"[R] Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, who was born at Quedlinburg"
9714,FOOTNOTES:,"on July 2, 1724, and died on March 14, 1803, was one of Germany's"
9715,FOOTNOTES:,most famous eighteenth century poets. While studying theology at Jena
9716,FOOTNOTES:,"University, he conceived the idea of a great spiritual epic, and"
9717,FOOTNOTES:,"actually planned in prose the first three cantos of ""The Messiah,"""
9718,FOOTNOTES:,which he afterwards finished at Leipzig. These were published
9719,FOOTNOTES:,"anonymously in the _Bremische Beiträge_ in 1748, the remaining five"
9720,FOOTNOTES:,appearing in 1773. Although the poem perhaps lacks in unity of
9721,FOOTNOTES:,"conception and precision of style, it contains many noble passages"
9722,FOOTNOTES:,that are admitted by critics to mark a very high order of lyrical
9723,FOOTNOTES:,genius. One of the chief distinctions of Klopstock was that he was
9724,FOOTNOTES:,the real inaugurator of the emancipation of the German intellect from
9725,FOOTNOTES:,the superficialism of French literary ascendancy. This distinction
9726,FOOTNOTES:,"was generously acknowledged by Goethe, who rejoiced at Klopstock's"
9727,FOOTNOTES:,success in first striking the keynote of intellectual freedom in
9728,FOOTNOTES:,"the Fatherland. Various odes, Biblical dramas, tragedies, and hymns"

10276,BONAFIDES.,TEMPLAR: Alas! 'twas I. You took my suit so coldly
10277,BONAFIDES.,"That when from Daya I had learned your secret,"
10278,BONAFIDES.,I fancied you had little mind to give
10279,BONAFIDES.,A Christian what from Christians you had taken.
10280,BONAFIDES.,"I thought to use my knowledge as a lever,"
10281,BONAFIDES.,"And so, not having you, I put the matter"
10282,BONAFIDES.,In problem-wise before the Patriarch.
10283,BONAFIDES.,Suppose he find you out. What then? He cannot
10284,BONAFIDES.,"Seize Recha, if she be no longer yours."
10285,BONAFIDES.,"Ah! give her then, to me, and let him come."
10286,BONAFIDES.,
10287,BONAFIDES.,"NATHAN: Too late! You are too late, for I have found"
10288,BONAFIDES.,"Her kinsfolk. Hark you, Recha has a brother."
10289,BONAFIDES.,
10290,BONAFIDES.,"TEMPLAR: Well, he's the man to fit her with a husband."
10291,BONAFIDES.,Of thee and me she'll have no longer need.
10292,BONAFIDES.,
10293,BONAFIDES.,
10294,BONAFIDES.,"SCENE V.--SALADIN'S _palace_. SALADIN _and his sister_, SITTAH, _are"

10296,BONAFIDES.,
10297,BONAFIDES.,SITTAH: Ah! I guessed it.
10298,BONAFIDES.,
10299,BONAFIDES.,RECHA:                  Guessed it? What? that I
10300,BONAFIDES.,Am Christian and not Nathan's daughter?
10301,BONAFIDES.,
10302,BONAFIDES.,[_She swoons_.
10303,BONAFIDES.,
10304,BONAFIDES.,SALADIN:                               What!
10305,BONAFIDES.,Whose cruelty hath sown this sharp suspicion
10306,BONAFIDES.,In thy fond heart? Ah! if there be two fathers
10307,BONAFIDES.,"At strife for thee, quit both, and take a third."
10308,BONAFIDES.,Take Saladin for father! I'll be kind.
10309,BONAFIDES.,
10310,BONAFIDES.,"SITTAH: Brother, you make her blush."
10311,BONAFIDES.,
10312,BONAFIDES.,SALADIN: In a good hour. Blushing becomes the fair.
10313,BONAFIDES.,"But see, our Nathan's coming, with another."
10314,BONAFIDES.,"Canst guess, sweet girl? Ay, when he comes, blush crimson."
10315,BONAFIDES.,
10316,BONAFIDES.,[_Enter_ NATHAN _and the_ TEMPLAR.

10320,BONAFIDES.,"Far more, than he for thee, for what was that"

10323,BONAFIDES.,[_Seeks to lead her to the_ TEMPLAR.

10325,BONAFIDES.,"NATHAN _(solemnly)_: Hold, Saladin; hold, Sittah! There's another"
10326,BONAFIDES.,Whom I must speak with first--the maiden's brother.
10327,BONAFIDES.,
10328,BONAFIDES.,"TEMPLAR _(bitterly)_: He has imposed a father on her, now"
10329,BONAFIDES.,He'll shark her up a brother! Where's the man?
10330,BONAFIDES.,
10331,BONAFIDES.,NATHAN:                                 Patience sir.
10332,BONAFIDES.,
10333,BONAFIDES.,"SALADIN: Christian, such words as yours had never passed"

10335,BONAFIDES.,
10336,BONAFIDES.,"NATHAN:         Forgive him, Saladin."
10337,BONAFIDES.,"Oh! Christian, you have hid from me your name."
10338,BONAFIDES.,"Conrade of Stauffen is no name of yours,"
10339,BONAFIDES.,But Guy of Filnek--mark. I tax you not
10340,BONAFIDES.,With falsehood; for your mother was a Stauffen.
10341,BONAFIDES.,Her brother's name was Conrade. He perchance
10342,BONAFIDES.,Adopted you?
10343,BONAFIDES.,
10344,BONAFIDES.,TEMPLAR: Even so the matter stands.
10345,BONAFIDES.,
10346,BONAFIDES.,NATHAN: Your father was my friend. He called himself
10347,BONAFIDES.,"Leonard of Filnek, but no German he."
10348,BONAFIDES.,He had espoused a German.
10349,BONAFIDES.,
10350,BONAFIDES.,"TEMPLAR:                   Ah! no more,"
10351,BONAFIDES.,"I beg, but tell me who is Recha's brother."
10352,BONAFIDES.,
10353,BONAFIDES.,NATHAN: Thou art the man!
10354,BONAFIDES.,
10355,BONAFIDES.,"TEMPLAR:                  What, I? I Recha's brother?"
10356,BONAFIDES.,
10357,BONAFIDES.,RECHA: My brother--he?
10358,BONAFIDES.,
10359,BONAFIDES.,SITTAH:                 So near akin--
10360,BONAFIDES.,
10361,BONAFIDES.,RECHA (_offering to embrace him_): My brother!
10362,BONAFIDES.,
10363,BONAFIDES.,TEMPLAR: (_withdrawing_): Brother to her!
10364,BONAFIDES.,
10365,BONAFIDES.,RECHA (_to_ NATHAN): It cannot be. His heart
10366,BONAFIDES.,Knows nothing of it.
10367,BONAFIDES.,
10368,BONAFIDES.,SALADIN:           What! not acknowledge
10369,BONAFIDES.,A sister such as she? Go!
10370,BONAFIDES.,
10371,BONAFIDES.,TEMPLAR:                Saladin!
10372,BONAFIDES.,Mistake not my amazement. Thy Assad
10373,BONAFIDES.,"At such a moment, had done likewise."
10374,BONAFIDES.,"Oh, Nathan, you have taken, you have given--"
10375,BONAFIDES.,"Yes, infinitely more--my sister--sister!"
10376,BONAFIDES.,
10377,BONAFIDES.,[_Embraces_ RECHA.
10378,BONAFIDES.,
10379,BONAFIDES.,NATHAN: Blanda of Filnek! Guy! My children both!
10380,BONAFIDES.,
10381,BONAFIDES.,SITTAH: Oh! I am deeply moved.
10382,BONAFIDES.,
10383,BONAFIDES.,SALADIN:                       And I half tremble
10384,BONAFIDES.,At thought of the emotion still to be.
10385,BONAFIDES.,"Nathan, you say her father was no German."
10386,BONAFIDES.,"What was he, then?"
10387,BONAFIDES.,
10388,BONAFIDES.,NATHAN:           He never told me that.
10389,BONAFIDES.,But ah! he loved the Persian speech and owned
10390,BONAFIDES.,He was no Frank.
10391,BONAFIDES.,
10392,BONAFIDES.,SALADIN: The Persian! Need I more? Twas my Assad!
10393,BONAFIDES.,
10394,BONAFIDES.,NATHAN: Look in this book!
10395,BONAFIDES.,
10396,BONAFIDES.,"SALADIN: Ay! 'tis his hand, even his."

10404,BONAFIDES.,With or without thy leave.
10405,BONAFIDES.,
10406,BONAFIDES.,TEMPLAR: I of thy blood? Then all the tales I heard

10536,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"Columns of shining smoke uprose, and flashes of flame were"

10543,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"Overwhelmed with the sight, yet speechless, the priest and the maidens"

10557,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"The exiles from Acadie landed some on one coast, some on another;"
10558,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],and the lovers were separated from one another. Evangeline sought
10559,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"everywhere for Gabriel, in towns and in the country, in churchyards"
10560,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"and on the prairies, in the camps and battlefields of the army, and"
10561,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],among missions of Jesuits and Moravians. But all in vain. She heard
10562,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"far and distant news of him, but never came upon him. And so the years"
10563,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"went by, and she grew old in her search."
10564,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],
10565,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"In that delightful land which is washed by the Delaware waters,"
10566,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"Guarding in sylvan shades the name of Penn, the apostle,"
10567,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],Stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded.
10568,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"There all the air is balm, and the peach is the emblem of beauty,"
10569,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"And the streets still re-echo the names of the trees of the forest,"
10570,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],As if they fain would appease the Dryads whose haunts they molested.
10571,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"There from the troubled sea had Evangeline landed, an exile,"
10572,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],Finding among the children of Penn a home and a country.
10573,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"Gabriel was not forgotten. Within her heart was his image,"
10574,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"Clothed in the beauty of love and youth, as last she beheld him."
10575,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"Over him years had no power; he was not changed, but transfigured;"
10576,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"He had become to her heart as one who is dead, and not absent."
10577,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],"Patience and abnegation of self, and devotion to others--"
10578,HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW[T],This was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her.

11249,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,of chance; the very blemishes of the world forbid one to regard it as
11250,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,divine. But the atoms do not rain through space in rigidly parallel
11251,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,lines. A minute swerve in their motion is essential to account for
11252,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,clashings and production; and in the ethical sphere it is this swerve
11253,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"which saves the mind from ""Necessity"" and makes free will possible."
11254,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"Though the universe appears to be at rest, this is a fallacy of the"
11255,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"senses, due to the fact that the motions of ""first bodies"" are not"
11256,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"cognisable by our eyes; indeed, a similar phenomenon is the apparent"
11257,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,vanishing of motion due to distance; for a white spot on a far-off
11258,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,hill may really be a frolicsome lamb.
11259,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,
11260,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"Oft on a hillside, cropping herbage rich,"
11261,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,The woolly flocks creep on whithersoe'er
11262,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"The grass bejewelled with fresh dew invites,"
11263,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,And full-fed lambs disport and butt in play--
11264,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,All this to eyes at distance looks a blur;
11265,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,On the green hill the white spot seems at rest.
11266,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,
11267,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"The shapes of atoms vary; and so differences of species, and"
11268,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"differences within the same species, arise. This variety in shape"
11269,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"accounts, too, for the varying action and effects of atoms. Atoms"
11270,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"in hard bodies, for example, are mainly hooked; but in liquids"
11271,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"mainly smooth. In each thing, however, there are several kinds,"
11272,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,which furnish that particular thing with a variety of properties.
11273,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"Furthermore, atoms are colourless, for in themselves they are"
11274,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"invisible; they never come into the light, whereas colour needs"
11275,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"light--witness the changing hues of the down on a pigeon's neck, or"
11276,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"of a peacock's tail. Atoms are themselves without senses, though they"
11277,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,produce things possessed of senses. To grasp the origin of species
11278,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"and development of animate nature, one must realise the momentous"
11279,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,importance of the arrangement and interconnection of atoms. Wood
11280,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"and other rotting bodies will bring forth worms, because material"
11281,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"particles undergo, under altered conditions, fresh permutations and"
11282,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"combinations. One may ask, what of man? He can laugh and weep, he"
11283,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"can discuss the composition of all things, and even inquire into the"
11284,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,nature of those very atoms! It is true that he springs from them. Yet
11285,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,"a man may laugh without being made of laughing atoms, and a man may"
11286,PROPERTIES OF ATOMS,reason without being made of reasonable atoms!

11316,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,_III.--Of Mind and Soul and Death_
11317,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,
11318,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,Mind and soul are portions of the body. While mind is the ruling
11319,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"element, they are both of the nature of the body--only they are"
11320,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,composed of exceedingly minute and subtle atoms capable of marvellous
11321,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"speed. Therefore, when death deprives the body of mind and soul, it"
11322,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,does not make the body appreciably lighter.
11323,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,
11324,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"It is as if a wine had lost its scent,"
11325,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,Or breath of some sweet perfume had escaped.
11326,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,
11327,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Mind and soul consist of spirit, air, heat, and an elusive fourth"
11328,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"constituent, the nimblest and subtlest of essences, the very ""soul of"
11329,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"the soul."" It follows that mind and soul are mortal. Among many proofs"
11330,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"may be adduced their close interconnection with the body, as seen"
11331,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,in cases of drunkenness and epilepsy; their curability by medicine;
11332,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,their inability to recall a state prior to their incarnation;
11333,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,their liability to be influenced by heredity like corporeal seeds.
11334,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Besides, why should an immortal soul need to quit the body at death?"
11335,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Decay surely could not hurt immortality! Then, again, imagine souls"
11336,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"contending for homes in a body about to be born! Consequently, the"
11337,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"soul being mortal, death has no sting."
11338,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,
11339,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"To us, then, death is nothing--matters naught,"
11340,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Since mortal is the nature of the mind,"
11341,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,E'en as in bygone time we felt no grief
11342,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,When Punic conflict hemmed all Rome around.
11343,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"When, rent by war's dread turbulence, the world"
11344,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Shuddered and quaked beneath the heaven's high realm,"
11345,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"So when we are no more, when soul and frame"
11346,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Of which we are compact, have been divorced,"
11347,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Be sure, to us, who then shall be no more,"
11348,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Naught can occur or ever make us feel,"
11349,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,Not e'en though earth were blent with sea and sky.
11350,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,
11351,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Men in general forget that death, in ending life's pleasures, also"
11352,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,ends the need and the desire for them.
11353,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,
11354,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"""Soon shall thy home greet thee in joy no more,"
11355,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,Nor faithful wife nor darling children run
11356,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"To snatch first kiss, and stir within thy heart"
11357,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,Sweet thoughts too deep for words. Thou canst no more
11358,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,Win wealth by working or defend thine own.
11359,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"The pity of it! One fell hour,"" they say,"
11360,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"""Hath robbed thee of thine every prize in life."""
11361,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Hereat they add not this: ""And now thou art"
11362,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Beset with yearning for such things no more."""
11363,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,
11364,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"The dead are to be envied, not lamented. The wise will exclaim: ""Thou,"
11365,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"O dead, art free from pain: we who survive are full of tears."""
11366,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,
11367,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"""What is so passing bitter,"" we should ask,"
11368,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"""If life be rounded by a rest and sleep,"
11369,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"That one should pine in never-ending grief?"""
11370,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,
11371,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,Universal nature has a rebuke for the coward that is afraid to die.
11372,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,There are no punishments beyond. Hell and hell's tortures are in this
11373,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,life. It is the victim of passion or of gnawing cares that is the real
11374,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,victim of torment.

11380,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Find each their place as 'twere with forethought keen,"
11381,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,Nor bargained what their movements were to be;
11382,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,But since the atom host in many ways
11383,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Smitten by blows for infinite ages back,"
11384,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"And by their weight impelled, have coursed along,"
11385,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Have joined all ways, and made full test of all"
11386,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"The types which mutual unions could create,"
11387,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Therefore it is that through great time dispersed,"
11388,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"With every kind of blend and motion tried,"
11389,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,They meet at length in momentary groups
11390,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,Which oft prove rudiments of mighty things--
11391,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Of earth, and sea, and sky, and living breeds."
11392,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,
11393,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,Amidst this primeval medley of warring atoms there was no sun-disk to
11394,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"be discerned climbing the vault, no stars, or sea, or sky, or earth,"
11395,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"or air--nothing, in fact, like what now exists. The next stage came"
11396,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"when the several parts began to fly asunder, and like to join with"
11397,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"like, so that the parts of the world were gradually differentiated."
11398,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,Heavier bodies combined in central chaos and forced out lighter
11399,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,elements to make ether. Thus earth was formed by a long process of
11400,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,condensation.
11401,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,
11402,EPICURUS AND THE GODS,"Daily, as ever more the ether-fires"

11571,JAMES MACPHERSON,The sunbeam pours its bright stream before him; his hair meets the wind
11572,JAMES MACPHERSON,of his hills. His face is settled from war. He is calm as the evening
11573,JAMES MACPHERSON,"beam that looks, from the cloud of the west, on Cona's silent vale. Who"
11574,JAMES MACPHERSON,"is it but Fingal, the king of mighty deeds! The feast is spread around;"
11575,JAMES MACPHERSON,the night passed away in joy.
11576,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11577,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11578,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Tell,"" said the mighty Fingal to Clessammor, ""the tale of thy youthful"
11579,JAMES MACPHERSON,"days. Let us hear the sorrow of thy youth, and the darkness of thy"
11580,JAMES MACPHERSON,"days."""
11581,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11582,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""It was in the days of peace,"" replied the great Clessammor. ""I came in"
11583,JAMES MACPHERSON,my bounding ship to Balclutha's walls of towers. Three days I remained
11584,JAMES MACPHERSON,"in Reuthamir's halls, and saw his daughter--that beam of light. Her"
11585,JAMES MACPHERSON,eyes were like the stars of night. My love for Moina was great; my
11586,JAMES MACPHERSON,heart poured forth in joy.
11587,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11588,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""The son of a stranger came--a chief who loved the white-bosomed Moina."
11589,JAMES MACPHERSON,The strength of his pride arose. We fought; he fell beneath my sword.
11590,JAMES MACPHERSON,"The banks of Clutha heard his fall, a thousand spears glittered around."
11591,JAMES MACPHERSON,I fought; the strangers prevailed. I plunged into the stream of Clutha.
11592,JAMES MACPHERSON,"My white sails rose over the waves, and I bounded on the dark-blue sea."
11593,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Moina came to the shore, her loose hair flew on the wind, and I heard"
11594,JAMES MACPHERSON,"her mournful, distant cries. Often did I turn my ship, but the winds of"
11595,JAMES MACPHERSON,"the east prevailed. Nor Clutha ever since have I seen, nor Moina of the"
11596,JAMES MACPHERSON,"dark-brown hair. She fell in Balclutha, for I have seen her ghost. I"
11597,JAMES MACPHERSON,"knew her as she came through the dusky night, along the murmur of Lora."
11598,JAMES MACPHERSON,"She was like the new moon seen through the gathered mist, when the sky"
11599,JAMES MACPHERSON,"pours down its flaky snow and the world is silent and dark."""
11600,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11601,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Raise, ye bards,"" said the mighty Fingal, ""the praise of unhappy"
11602,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Moina."""
11603,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11604,JAMES MACPHERSON,The night passed away in song; morning returned in joy. The mountains
11605,JAMES MACPHERSON,showed their grey heads; the blue face of ocean smiled. But as the sun
11606,JAMES MACPHERSON,rose on the sea Fingal and his heroes beheld a distant fleet. Like a
11607,JAMES MACPHERSON,"mist on the ocean came the strange ships, and discharged their youth"
11608,JAMES MACPHERSON,"upon the coast. Carthon, their chief, was among them, like the stag in"
11609,JAMES MACPHERSON,"the midst of the herd. He was a king of spears, and as he moved towards"
11610,JAMES MACPHERSON,Selma his thousands moved behind him.
11611,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11612,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Go, with a song of peace,"" said Fingal. ""Go, Ullin, to the king of"
11613,JAMES MACPHERSON,spears. Tell him that the ghosts of our foes are many; but renowned are
11614,JAMES MACPHERSON,"they who have feasted in my halls!"""
11615,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11616,JAMES MACPHERSON,"When Ullin came to the mighty Carthon, he raised the song of peace."
11617,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11618,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Come to the feast of Fingal, Carthon, from the rolling sea! Partake of"
11619,JAMES MACPHERSON,"the feast of the king, or lift the spear of war. Behold that field, O"
11620,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Carthon. Many a green hill rises there, with mossy stones and rustling"
11621,JAMES MACPHERSON,"grass. These are the tombs of Fingal's foes, the sons of the rolling"
11622,JAMES MACPHERSON,"sea!"""
11623,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11624,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Dost thou speak to the weak in arms,"" said Carthon, ""bard of the"
11625,JAMES MACPHERSON,woody Morven? Have not I seen the fallen Balclutha? And shall I feast
11626,JAMES MACPHERSON,"with Fingal, the son of Comhal, who threw his fire in the midst of my"
11627,JAMES MACPHERSON,"father's hall? I was young, and knew not the cause why the virgins"
11628,JAMES MACPHERSON,"wept. But when the years of my youth came on, I beheld the moss of my"
11629,JAMES MACPHERSON,"fallen walls; my sigh arose with the morning, and my tears descended"
11630,JAMES MACPHERSON,"with night. Shall I not fight, I said to my soul, against the children"
11631,JAMES MACPHERSON,"of my foes? And I will fight, O bard! I feel the strength of my soul."""
11632,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11633,JAMES MACPHERSON,"His people gathered round the hero, and drew their shining swords. The"
11634,JAMES MACPHERSON,"spear trembled in his hand. Bending forward, he seemed to threaten the"
11635,JAMES MACPHERSON,king.
11636,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11637,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Who of my chiefs,"" said Fingal, ""will meet the son of the rolling sea?"
11638,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Many are his warriors on the coast, and strong is his ashen spear."""
11639,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11640,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Cathul rose, in his strength, the son of the mighty Lormar. Three"
11641,JAMES MACPHERSON,"hundred youths attend the chief, the race of his native streams. Feeble"
11642,JAMES MACPHERSON,"was his arm against Carthon; he fell, and his heroes fled. Connal"
11643,JAMES MACPHERSON,"resumed the battle, but he broke his heavy spear; he lay bound on the"
11644,JAMES MACPHERSON,field; Carthon pursued his people.
11645,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11646,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Clessammor,"" said the king of Morven, ""where is the spear of my"
11647,JAMES MACPHERSON,"strength? Wilt thou behold Connal bound?"""
11648,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11649,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Clessammor rose in the strength of his steel, shaking his grizzly"
11650,JAMES MACPHERSON,"locks. He fitted the shield to his side; he rushed, in the pride of"
11651,JAMES MACPHERSON,valour.
11652,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11653,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Carthon saw the hero rushing on, and loved the dreadful joy of his"
11654,JAMES MACPHERSON,"face; his strength, in the locks of age!"
11655,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11656,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Stately are his steps of age,"" he said. ""Lovely the remnant of his"
11657,JAMES MACPHERSON,"years! Perhaps it is the husband of Moina, the father of car-borne"
11658,JAMES MACPHERSON,Carthon. Often have I heard that he dwelt at the echoing stream of
11659,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Lora."""
11660,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11661,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Such were his words, when Clessammor came, and lifted high his spear."
11662,JAMES MACPHERSON,"The youth received it on his shield, and spoke the words of peace."
11663,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11664,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Warrior of the aged locks! Hast thou no son to raise the shield before"
11665,JAMES MACPHERSON,his father to meet the arm of youth? What will be the fame of my sword
11666,JAMES MACPHERSON,"shouldst thou fall?"""
11667,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11668,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""It will be great, thou son of pride!"" began the tall Clessammor. ""I"
11669,JAMES MACPHERSON,"have been renowned in battle, but I never told my name to a foe. Yield"
11670,JAMES MACPHERSON,"to me, son of the wave; then shalt thou know that the mark of my sword"
11671,JAMES MACPHERSON,"is in many a field."""
11672,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11673,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""I never yield, king of spears!"" replied the noble pride of Carthon."
11674,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Retire among thy friends! Let younger heroes fight."""
11675,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11676,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Why dost thou wound my soul?"" replied Clessammor, with a tear. ""Age"
11677,JAMES MACPHERSON,does not tremble on my hand; I still can lift the sword. Shall I fly
11678,JAMES MACPHERSON,"in Fingal's sight, in the sight of him I love? Son of the sea, I never"
11679,JAMES MACPHERSON,"fled! Exalt thy pointed spear!"""
11680,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11681,JAMES MACPHERSON,"They fought, like two contending winds that strive to roll the wave."
11682,JAMES MACPHERSON,Carthon bade his spear to err; he still thought that the foe was the
11683,JAMES MACPHERSON,spouse of Moina. He broke Clessammor's beamy spear in twain; he seized
11684,JAMES MACPHERSON,"his shining sword. But as Carthon was binding the chief, the chief drew"
11685,JAMES MACPHERSON,"the dagger of his fathers. He saw the foe's uncovered side, and opened"
11686,JAMES MACPHERSON,there a wound.
11687,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11688,JAMES MACPHERSON,Fingal saw Clessammor low; he moved in the sound of his steel. The
11689,JAMES MACPHERSON,host stood silent in his presence; they turned their eyes to the king.
11690,JAMES MACPHERSON,"He came, like the sullen noise of a storm before the winds arise."
11691,JAMES MACPHERSON,Carthon stood in his place; the blood is rushing down his side; he saw
11692,JAMES MACPHERSON,"the coming down of the king. Pale was his cheek; his hair flew loose,"
11693,JAMES MACPHERSON,"his helmet shook on high. The force of Carthon failed, but his soul was"
11694,JAMES MACPHERSON,strong.
11695,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11696,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""King of Morven,"" Carthon said, ""I fall in the midst of my course."
11697,JAMES MACPHERSON,"But raise my remembrance on the banks of Lora, where my father dwelt."
11698,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Perhaps the husband of Moina will mourn over his fallen Carthon."""
11699,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11700,JAMES MACPHERSON,"His words reached Clessammor. He fell, in silence, on his son. The host"
11701,JAMES MACPHERSON,stood darkened around; no voice is on the plain. Night came; the moon
11702,JAMES MACPHERSON,"from the east looked on the mournful field; but still they stood, like"
11703,JAMES MACPHERSON,"a silent grove that lifts its head on Gormal, when the loud winds are"
11704,JAMES MACPHERSON,"laid, and dark autumn is on the plain; and then they died."
11705,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11706,JAMES MACPHERSON,Fingal was sad for Carthon; he commanded his bards to sing the hero's
11707,JAMES MACPHERSON,"praise. Ossian joined them, and this was his song: ""My soul has been"
11708,JAMES MACPHERSON,"mournful for Carthon; he fell in the days of his youth. And thou, O"
11709,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Clessammor, where is thy dwelling in the wind? Has the youth forgot"
11710,JAMES MACPHERSON,"his wound? Flies he, on clouds, with thee? Perhaps they may come to my"
11711,JAMES MACPHERSON,dreams. I think I hear a feeble voice! The beam of heaven delights to
11712,JAMES MACPHERSON,shine on the grave of Carthon. I feel it warm around.
11713,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11714,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""O thou that rollest above, round as the shield of my fathers! Whence"
11715,JAMES MACPHERSON,"are thy beams, O sun, thy everlasting light? Thou comest forth in thy"
11716,JAMES MACPHERSON,"awful beauty; the stars hide themselves in the sky; the moon, cold and"
11717,JAMES MACPHERSON,"pale, sinks in the western wave. But thou thyself movest alone. Who"
11718,JAMES MACPHERSON,can be a companion of thy course? The oaks of the mountains fall; the
11719,JAMES MACPHERSON,mountains themselves decay with years; the ocean shrinks and grows
11720,JAMES MACPHERSON,again; the moon herself is lost in heaven; but thou art for ever the
11721,JAMES MACPHERSON,"same, rejoicing in the brightness of thy course."
11722,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11723,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""When the world is dark with tempests; when thunder rolls, and"
11724,JAMES MACPHERSON,"lightning flies, thou lookest in thy beauty from the clouds, and"
11725,JAMES MACPHERSON,"laughest at the storm. But to Ossian thou lookest in vain, for he"
11726,JAMES MACPHERSON,beholds thy beams no more; whether thy yellow hair flows on the eastern
11727,JAMES MACPHERSON,"clouds, or thou tremblest at the gates of the west. But thou art"
11728,JAMES MACPHERSON,"perhaps, like me, for a season; thy years will have an end. Thou shalt"
11729,JAMES MACPHERSON,"sleep in thy clouds; careless of the voice of the morning. Exult thee,"
11730,JAMES MACPHERSON,"O sun, in the strength of thy youth! Age is dark and unlovely. It is"
11731,JAMES MACPHERSON,like the glimmering light of the moon when it shines through broken
11732,JAMES MACPHERSON,clouds and the mist is on the hills; the blast of north is on the
11733,JAMES MACPHERSON,"plain; the traveller shrinks in the midst of his journey."""

11736,JAMES MACPHERSON,_II.--Darthula_
11737,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11738,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Daughter of heaven, fair art thou! The silence of thy face is pleasant!"
11739,JAMES MACPHERSON,Thou comest forth in loveliness. The stars attend thy blue course in
11740,JAMES MACPHERSON,"the east. The clouds rejoice in thy presence, O moon! Look from thy"
11741,JAMES MACPHERSON,"gates in the sky. Burst the cloud, O wind, that the daughter of night"
11742,JAMES MACPHERSON,"may look forth, that the shaggy mountains may brighten, and the ocean"
11743,JAMES MACPHERSON,roll its white waves in light!
11744,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11745,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Nathos is on the deep, and Althos, that beam of youth. Ardan is near"
11746,JAMES MACPHERSON,his brothers. They move in the gloom of their course. The sons of
11747,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Usnoth move in darkness, from the wrath of Cairbar of Erin. Who is"
11748,JAMES MACPHERSON,"that, dim, by their side? The night has covered her beauty! Who is it"
11749,JAMES MACPHERSON,"but Darthula, the first of Erin's maids? She has fled from the love"
11750,JAMES MACPHERSON,"of Caribar, with blue-shielded Nathos. But the winds deceive thee, O"
11751,JAMES MACPHERSON,Darthula! They deny the woody Etha to thy sails. These are not the
11752,JAMES MACPHERSON,mountains of Nathos; nor is that the roar of his climbing waves. The
11753,JAMES MACPHERSON,halls of Cairbar are near; the towers of the foe lift their heads! Erin
11754,JAMES MACPHERSON,stretches its green head into the sea. Tura's bay receives the ship.
11755,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Where have ye been, ye southern winds, when the sons of my love were"
11756,JAMES MACPHERSON,"deceived? But ye have been sporting on plains, pursuing the thistle's"
11757,JAMES MACPHERSON,beard. Oh that ye had been rustling in the sails of Nathos till the
11758,JAMES MACPHERSON,"hills of Etha arose; till they arose in their clouds, and saw their"
11759,JAMES MACPHERSON,returning chief!
11760,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11761,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Long hast thou been absent, Nathos--the day of thy return is past!"
11762,JAMES MACPHERSON,Lovely thou wast in the eyes of Darthula. Thy soul was generous and
11763,JAMES MACPHERSON,"mild, like the hour of the setting sun. But when the rage of battle"
11764,JAMES MACPHERSON,"rose, thou wast a sea in a storm. The clang of thy arms was terrible;"
11765,JAMES MACPHERSON,the host vanished at the sound of thy coarse. It was then Darthula
11766,JAMES MACPHERSON,"beheld thee from the top of her mossy tower; from the tower of Selama,"
11767,JAMES MACPHERSON,where her fathers dwelt.
11768,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11769,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Lovely art thou, O stranger!"" she said, for her trembling soul arose."
11770,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Fair art thou in thy battles, friend of the fallen Cormac! Why dost"
11771,JAMES MACPHERSON,"thou rush on in thy valour, youth of the ruddy look? Few are thy hands"
11772,JAMES MACPHERSON,in fight against the dark-browed Cairbar! Oh that I might be freed from
11773,JAMES MACPHERSON,"his love--that I might rejoice in the presence of Nathos!"""
11774,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11775,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Such were thy words, Darthula, in Selama's mossy towers. But now the"
11776,JAMES MACPHERSON,"night is around thee. The winds have deceived thy sails, Darthula!"
11777,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Cease a little while, O north wind! Let me hear the voice of the"
11778,JAMES MACPHERSON,"lovely. Thy voice is lovely, Darthula, between the rustling blasts!"
11779,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11780,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Are these the rocks of Nathos?"" she said. ""This the roar of his"

11782,JAMES MACPHERSON,The mist spreads around; the beam is feeble and distant far. But the
11783,JAMES MACPHERSON,light of Darthula's soul dwells in the chief of Etha! Son of the

11786,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11787,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""These are not the rocks of Nathos,"" he replied, ""nor this the roar"
11788,JAMES MACPHERSON,"of his streams. We are in the land of strangers, in the land of cruel"
11789,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Cairbar. The winds have deceived us, Darthula. Erin lifts here her"
11790,JAMES MACPHERSON,"hills. Go towards the north, Althos; be thy steps, Ardan, along the"
11791,JAMES MACPHERSON,"coast; that the foe may not come in darkness, and our hopes of Etha"
11792,JAMES MACPHERSON,fail. I will go towards that mossy tower to see who dwells about the
11793,JAMES MACPHERSON,"beam."""
11794,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11795,JAMES MACPHERSON,He went. She sat alone; she heard the rolling of the wave. The big tear
11796,JAMES MACPHERSON,is in her eye. She looks for returning Nathos.
11797,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11798,JAMES MACPHERSON,"He returned, but his face was dark."
11799,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11800,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Why art thou sad, O Nathos?"" said the lovely daughter of Colla."
11801,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11802,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""We are in the land of foes,"" replied the hero. ""The winds have"
11803,JAMES MACPHERSON,"deceived us, Darthula. The strength of our friends is not near, nor the"
11804,JAMES MACPHERSON,"mountains of Etha. Where shall I find thy peace, daughter of mighty"
11805,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Colla? The brothers of Nathos are brave, and his own sword has shone"
11806,JAMES MACPHERSON,in fight! But what are the sons of Usnoth to the host of dark-browed
11807,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Cairbar? Oh that the winds had brought thy sails, Oscar, king of men!"
11808,JAMES MACPHERSON,Thou didst promise to come to the battles of fallen Cormac! Cairbar
11809,JAMES MACPHERSON,"would tremble in his halls, and peace dwell round the lovely Darthula."
11810,JAMES MACPHERSON,"But why dost thou fall, my soul? The sons of Usnoth may prevail!"""
11811,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11812,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""And they will prevail, O Nathos!"" said the rising soul of the maid."
11813,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Never shall Darthula behold the halls of gloomy Cairbar. Give me those"
11814,JAMES MACPHERSON,"arms of brass, that glitter to the passing meteor. I see them dimly in"
11815,JAMES MACPHERSON,"the dark-bosomed ship. Darthula will enter the battle of steel."""
11816,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11817,JAMES MACPHERSON,Joy rose in the face of Nathos when he heard the white-bosomed maid. He
11818,JAMES MACPHERSON,looks towards the coming of Cairbar. The wind is rustling in his hair.
11819,JAMES MACPHERSON,Darthula is silent at his side. Her look is fixed on the chief. She
11820,JAMES MACPHERSON,strives to hide the rising sigh.
11821,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11822,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Morning rose with its beams. The sons of Erin appear, like grey rocks,"
11823,JAMES MACPHERSON,with all their trees; they spread along the coast. Cairbar stood in the
11824,JAMES MACPHERSON,"midst. He grimly smiled when he saw the foe. Nathos rushed forward, in"
11825,JAMES MACPHERSON,"his strength; nor could Darthula stay behind. She came with the hero,"
11826,JAMES MACPHERSON,lifting her shining spear.
11827,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11828,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Come,"" said Nathos to Cairbar--""come, chief of high Temora! Let our"
11829,JAMES MACPHERSON,"battle be on the coast, for the white-bosomed maid. His people are not"
11830,JAMES MACPHERSON,with Nathos; they are behind these rolling seas. Why dost thou bring
11831,JAMES MACPHERSON,"thy thousands against the chief of Etha?"""
11832,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11833,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Youth of the heart of pride,"" replied Cairbar, ""shall Erin's king"
11834,JAMES MACPHERSON,"fight with thee? Thy fathers were not among the renowned, and Cairbar"
11835,JAMES MACPHERSON,"does not fight with feeble men!"""
11836,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11837,JAMES MACPHERSON,The tear started from car-borne Nathos. He turned his eyes to his
11838,JAMES MACPHERSON,brothers. Their spears flew at once. Three heroes lay on earth. Then
11839,JAMES MACPHERSON,"the light of their swords gleamed on high. The ranks of Erin yield, as"
11840,JAMES MACPHERSON,a ridge of dark clouds before a blast of wind! Then Cairbar ordered his
11841,JAMES MACPHERSON,"people, and they drew a thousand bows. A thousand arrows flew. The sons"
11842,JAMES MACPHERSON,"of Usnoth fell in blood. They fell like three young oaks, which stood"
11843,JAMES MACPHERSON,"alone on the hill. The traveller saw the lovely trees, and wondered how"
11844,JAMES MACPHERSON,"they grew so lonely; the blast of the desert came by night, and laid"
11845,JAMES MACPHERSON,"their green heads low; next day he returned, but they were withered,"
11846,JAMES MACPHERSON,and the heath was bare!
11847,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11848,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Darthula stood in silent grief, and beheld their fall! Pale was her"
11849,JAMES MACPHERSON,cheek. Her trembling lips broke short a half-formed word. Her breast
11850,JAMES MACPHERSON,of snow appeared. It appeared; but it was stained with blood. An arrow
11851,JAMES MACPHERSON,"was fixed in her side. She fell on the fallen Nathos, like a wreath of"
11852,JAMES MACPHERSON,snow! Her hair spreads wide on his face. Their blood is mixing round!
11853,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11854,JAMES MACPHERSON,"""Daughter of Colla--thou art low!"" said Cairbar's hundred bards. ""When"
11855,JAMES MACPHERSON,"wilt thou rise in thy beauty, first of Erin's maids? Thy sleep is"
11856,JAMES MACPHERSON,"long in the tomb. The sun shall not come to thy bed and say, 'Awake,"
11857,JAMES MACPHERSON,Darthula! Awake thou first of women! The wind of spring is abroad. The
11858,JAMES MACPHERSON,flowers shake their heads on the green hills. The winds wave their
11859,JAMES MACPHERSON,"growing leaves.' Retire, O sun, the daughter of Colla is asleep! She"
11860,JAMES MACPHERSON,will not come forth in her beauty. She will not move in the steps of
11861,JAMES MACPHERSON,"her loveliness!"""
11862,JAMES MACPHERSON,
11863,JAMES MACPHERSON,"Such was the song of the bards when they raised the tomb. I, too, sang"
11864,JAMES MACPHERSON,over the grave when the king of Morven came to green Erin to fight with
11865,JAMES MACPHERSON,the car-borne Cairbar!

12950,MARRALL.,
12951,MARRALL.,"MARRALL: Before, like you, I had outlived my fortunes,"
12952,MARRALL.,A withe had served my turn to hang myself.
12953,MARRALL.,Is there no purse to be cut? House to be broken?
12954,MARRALL.,"Or market-woman with eggs that you may murder,"
12955,MARRALL.,And so dispatch the business?

12957,MARRALL.,"WELLBORN:                    Here's variety,"
12958,MARRALL.,I must confess; but I'll accept of none
12959,MARRALL.,"Of all your gentle offers, I assure you."
12960,MARRALL.,"Despite the rhetoric that the fiend has taught you,"
12961,MARRALL.,I am as far as thou art from despair.
12962,MARRALL.,"Nay, I have confidence, which is more than hope,"
12963,MARRALL.,"To live, and suddenly, better than ever."
12964,MARRALL.,"Come, dine with me, and with a gallant lady."
12965,MARRALL.,
12966,MARRALL.,MARRALL: With the lady of the lake or queen of fairies?
12967,MARRALL.,For I know it must be an enchanted dinner.

12971,MARRALL.,"MARRALL:                  Nay, now there's hope"
12972,MARRALL.,Thy brain is cracked.

13002,ACT II,"of_ MARGARET _and_ ALLWORTH, LORD LOVELL _has assured the"
13003,ACT II,"latter that he will help bring it to a successful issue,"
13004,ACT II,and that neither the beauty nor the wealth of_ SIR GILES'S

13029,ACT II,"To her presence, I dare warrant you; and there plead"
13030,ACT II,"For my good lord, if you shall find occasion."
13031,ACT II,"That done, pray ride to Nottingham; get a licence"
13032,ACT II,"Still by this token. I'll have it dispatched,"
13033,ACT II,"And suddenly, my lord, that I may say"
13034,ACT II,"My honourable, nay, right honourable daughter."
13035,ACT II,
13036,ACT II,LOVELL: Haste your return.
13037,ACT II,

13041,ACT II,
13042,ACT II,OVERREACH: I came not to make offer with my daughter
13043,ACT II,A certain portion; that were poor and trivial:
13044,ACT II,"In one word, I pronounce all that is mine,"
13045,ACT II,"In lands, or leases, ready coin, or goods,"
13046,ACT II,"With her, my lord, comes to you; nor shall you have"
13047,ACT II,One motive to induce you to believe
13048,ACT II,"I live too long, since every year I'll add"
13049,ACT II,"Something unto the heap, which shall be yours too."
13050,ACT II,
13051,ACT II,LOVELL: You are a right kind father.
13052,ACT II,
13053,ACT II,OVERREACH:                        You'll have reason
13054,ACT II,To think me such. How do you like this seat?
13055,ACT II,Would it not serve to entertain your friends?
13056,ACT II,
13057,ACT II,"LOVELL: A well-built pile; and she that's mistress of it,"
13058,ACT II,Worthy the large revenue.
13059,ACT II,
13060,ACT II,"OVERREACH:               She, the mistress?"
13061,ACT II,It may be so for a time; but let my lord
13062,ACT II,"Say only he but like it, and would have it,"
13063,ACT II,I say ere long 'tis his.
13064,ACT II,
13065,ACT II,LOVELL:                Impossible.
13066,ACT II,
13067,ACT II,OVERREACH: You do conclude too fast. 'Tis not alone
13068,ACT II,"The Lady Allworth's lands; for these, once Wellborn's"
13069,ACT II,"(As, by her dotage on him, I know they will be),"
13070,ACT II,Shall soon be mine. But point out any man's
13071,ACT II,"In all the shire, and say they lie convenient"
13072,ACT II,"And useful for your lordship, and once more"
13073,ACT II,"I say aloud, they are yours."
13074,ACT II,
13075,ACT II,LOVELL:                    I dare not own
13076,ACT II,What's by unjust and cruel means extorted:
13077,ACT II,My fame and credit are too dear to me.
13078,ACT II,
13079,ACT II,OVERREACH: Your reputation shall stand as fair
13080,ACT II,In all good men's opinions as now.
13081,ACT II,All my ambition is to have my daughter
13082,ACT II,Right honourable; which my lord can make her:
13083,ACT II,And might I live to dance upon my knee
13084,ACT II,"A young Lord Lovell, borne by her unto you,"
13085,ACT II,I write _nil ultra_ to my proudest hopes.
13086,ACT II,I'll ruin the country to supply your waste:
13087,ACT II,"The scourge of prodigals, want, shall never find you."
13088,ACT II,
13089,ACT II,LOVELL: Are you not moved with the imprecations
13090,ACT II,"And curses of whole families, made wretched"
13091,ACT II,By these practices?
13092,ACT II,
13093,ACT II,"OVERREACH:         Yes, as rocks are,"
13094,ACT II,When foamy billows split themselves against
13095,ACT II,Their flinty ribs; or as the moon is moved
13096,ACT II,"When wolves, with hunger pined, howl at her brightness."
13097,ACT II,I only think what 'tis to have my daughter
13098,ACT II,"Right honourable; and 'tis a powerful charm,"
13099,ACT II,"Makes me insensible of remorse, or pity,"
13100,ACT II,Or the least sting of conscience.
13101,ACT II,
13102,ACT II,LOVELL:                          I admire
13103,ACT II,The toughness of your nature.
13104,ACT II,
13105,ACT II,"OVERREACH:                       'Tis for you,"
13106,ACT II,"My lord, and for my daughter I am marble."
13107,ACT II,"My haste commands me hence: in one word, therefore,"
13108,ACT II,"Is it a match, my lord?"
13109,ACT II,
13110,ACT II,LOVELL: I hope that is past doubt now.
13111,ACT II,
13112,ACT II,"OVERREACH: Then rest secure; not the hate of all mankind,"
13113,ACT II,"Not fear of what can fall on me hereafter,"
13114,ACT II,Shall make me study aught but your advancement
13115,ACT II,One storey higher: an earl! if gold can do it.              [_Exit._
13116,ACT II,
13117,ACT II,LOVELL: He's gone; I wonder how the earth can bear
13118,ACT II,"Such a portent! I, that have lived a soldier,"
13119,ACT II,"And stood the enemy's violent charge undaunted,"
13120,ACT II,Am bathed in a cold sweat.

14011,JOHN MILTON[AA],"state of bliss into what woe."" He tells how the Divine decree of"
14012,JOHN MILTON[AA],"obedience to the Only Son was received by Satan with envy, because he"
14013,JOHN MILTON[AA],"felt ""himself impaired""; and how, consulting with Beelzebub, he drew"
14014,JOHN MILTON[AA],"away all the Spirits under their command to the ""spacious North,"""
14015,JOHN MILTON[AA],"and, taunting them with being eclipsed, proposed that they should"
14016,JOHN MILTON[AA],"rebel. Only Abdiel remained faithful, and urged them to cease their"
14017,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""impious rage,"" and seek pardon in time, or they might find that He"
14018,JOHN MILTON[AA],Who had created them could uncreate them.
14019,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14020,JOHN MILTON[AA],"So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found;"
14021,JOHN MILTON[AA],Among the faithless faithful only he;
14022,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Among innumerable false unmoved,"
14023,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,"
14024,JOHN MILTON[AA],"His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;"
14025,JOHN MILTON[AA],Nor number nor example with him wrought
14026,JOHN MILTON[AA],"To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind"
14027,JOHN MILTON[AA],Though single.

14030,JOHN MILTON[AA],_VI.--The Story of Satan's Revolt_
14031,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14032,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Raphael, continuing, tells Adam how Abdiel flew back to Heaven with"
14033,JOHN MILTON[AA],"the story of the revolt, but found it was known. The Sovran Voice"
14034,JOHN MILTON[AA],"having welcomed the faithful messenger with ""Servant of God, well"
14035,JOHN MILTON[AA],"done!"" orders the Archangels Michael and Gabriel to lead forth the"
14036,JOHN MILTON[AA],"celestial armies, while the banded powers of Satan are hastening on"
14037,JOHN MILTON[AA],"to set the Proud Aspirer on the very Mount of God. ""Long time in even"
14038,JOHN MILTON[AA],"scale the battle hung,"" but with the dawning of the third day, the"
14039,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Father directed the Messiah to ascend his chariot, and end the strife."
14040,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""Far off his coming shone,"" and at His presence ""Heaven his wonted"
14041,JOHN MILTON[AA],"face renewed, and with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled."" But,"
14042,JOHN MILTON[AA],"nearing the foe, His countenance changed into a terror ""too severe to"
14043,JOHN MILTON[AA],"be beheld."""
14044,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14045,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Full soon among them He arrived, in His right hand"
14046,JOHN MILTON[AA],Grasping ten thousand thunders....
14047,JOHN MILTON[AA],"They, astonished, all resistance lost,"
14048,JOHN MILTON[AA],All courage; down their idle weapons dropt....
14049,JOHN MILTON[AA],.... Headlong themselves they threw
14050,JOHN MILTON[AA],Down from the verge of Heaven; eternal wrath
14051,JOHN MILTON[AA],Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.
14052,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14053,JOHN MILTON[AA],"A like fate, Raphael warns Adam, may befall mankind if they are guilty"
14054,JOHN MILTON[AA],of disobedience.

14056,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14057,JOHN MILTON[AA],_VII.--The New Creation_
14058,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14059,JOHN MILTON[AA],"The ""affable Archangel,"" at Adam's request, continues his talk by"
14060,JOHN MILTON[AA],telling how the world began. Lest Lucifer should take a pride in
14061,JOHN MILTON[AA],"having ""dispeopled Heaven,"" God announces to the Son that he will"
14062,JOHN MILTON[AA],"create another world, and a race to dwell in it who may"
14063,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14064,JOHN MILTON[AA],Open to themselves at length the way
14065,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Up hither, under long obedience tried,"
14066,JOHN MILTON[AA],"And Earth be changed to Heaven, and Heaven to Earth,"
14067,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14068,JOHN MILTON[AA],"This creation is to be the work of the Son, who, girt with"
14069,JOHN MILTON[AA],"omnipotence, prepares to go forth."
14070,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14071,JOHN MILTON[AA],Heaven opened wide
14072,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Her ever-daring gates, harmonious sound"
14073,JOHN MILTON[AA],"On golden hinges moving, to let forth"
14074,JOHN MILTON[AA],"The King of Glory, in his powerful Word"
14075,JOHN MILTON[AA],And Spirit coming to create new worlds.
14076,JOHN MILTON[AA],"On Heavenly ground they stood, and from the shore"
14077,JOHN MILTON[AA],They viewed the vast immeasurable Abyss
14078,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild,"
14079,JOHN MILTON[AA],Up from the bottom turned by furious winds
14080,JOHN MILTON[AA],"And surging waves, as mountains to assault"
14081,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Heaven's highth, and with the centre mix the pole."
14082,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""Silence, ye troubled waves, and thou Deep, peace!"""
14083,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Said then the omnific Word. ""Your discord end!"""
14084,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Nor stayed; but on the wings of cherubim,"
14085,JOHN MILTON[AA],Uplifted in paternal glory rode
14086,JOHN MILTON[AA],Far into Chaos and the World unborn;
14087,JOHN MILTON[AA],For Chaos heard his voice....
14088,JOHN MILTON[AA],"And Earth, self-balanced on her centre hung."
14089,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14090,JOHN MILTON[AA],The six days' creative work is then described in the order of Genesis.

14093,JOHN MILTON[AA],_VIII.--The Creation of Adam_
14094,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14095,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Asked by Adam to tell him about the motions of the heavenly bodies,"
14096,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Raphael adjures him to refrain from thought on ""matters hid; to serve"
14097,JOHN MILTON[AA],"God and fear; and to be lowly wise."" He then asks Adam to tell him of"
14098,JOHN MILTON[AA],"his creation, he having at the time been absent on ""excursion toward"
14099,JOHN MILTON[AA],"the gates of Hell."" Adam complies, and relates how he appealed to"
14100,JOHN MILTON[AA],"God for a companion, and was answered in the fairest of God's gifts."
14101,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Raphael warns Adam to beware lest passion for Eve sway his judgment,"
14102,JOHN MILTON[AA],"for on him depends the weal or woe, not only of himself, but of all"
14103,JOHN MILTON[AA],his sons.
14104,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14105,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14106,JOHN MILTON[AA],_IX.--The Temptation and the Fall_
14107,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14108,JOHN MILTON[AA],"While Raphael was in Paradise, for seven nights, Satan hid himself by"
14109,JOHN MILTON[AA],"circling round in the shadow of the Earth, then, rising as a mist, he"
14110,JOHN MILTON[AA],"crept into Eden undetected, and entered the serpent as the ""fittest"
14111,JOHN MILTON[AA],"imp of fraud,"" but not until once more lamenting that the enjoyment of"
14112,JOHN MILTON[AA],"the earth was not for him. In the morning, when the human pair came"
14113,JOHN MILTON[AA],"forth to their pleasant labours, Eve suggested that they should work"
14114,JOHN MILTON[AA],"apart, for when near each other ""looks intervene and smiles,"" and"
14115,JOHN MILTON[AA],"casual discourse. Adam replied, defending ""this sweet intercourse of"
14116,JOHN MILTON[AA],"looks and smiles,"" and saying they had been made not for irksome toil,"
14117,JOHN MILTON[AA],but for delight.
14118,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14119,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""But if much converse perhaps"
14120,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield;"
14121,JOHN MILTON[AA],"For solitude sometimes is best society,"
14122,JOHN MILTON[AA],And short retirement urges sweet return.
14123,JOHN MILTON[AA],"But other doubt possessed me, lest harm"
14124,JOHN MILTON[AA],Befall thee....
14125,JOHN MILTON[AA],"The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,"
14126,JOHN MILTON[AA],Safest and seemliest by her husband stays
14127,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Who guards her, or the worst with her endures."""
14128,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14129,JOHN MILTON[AA],Eve replies:
14130,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14131,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""That such an enemy we have, who seeks"
14132,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Our ruin, both by thee informed I learn,"
14133,JOHN MILTON[AA],"And from the parting Angel overheard,"
14134,JOHN MILTON[AA],"As in a shady nook I stood behind,"
14135,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Just then returned at shut of evening flowers."""
14136,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14137,JOHN MILTON[AA],"She, however, repels the suggestion that she can be deceived. Adam"
14138,JOHN MILTON[AA],"replies that he does not wish her to be tempted, and that united they"
14139,JOHN MILTON[AA],would be stronger and more watchful. Eve responds that if Eden is so
14140,JOHN MILTON[AA],"exposed that they are not secure apart, how can they be happy? Adams"
14141,JOHN MILTON[AA],"gives way, with the explanation that it is not mistrust but tender"
14142,JOHN MILTON[AA],"love that enjoins him to watch over her, and, as she leaves him,"
14143,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14144,JOHN MILTON[AA],Her long with ardent look his eye pursued
14145,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Delighted, but desiring more her stay."
14146,JOHN MILTON[AA],Oft he to her his charge of quick return
14147,JOHN MILTON[AA],Repeated; she to him as oft engaged
14148,JOHN MILTON[AA],"To be returned by noon amid the bower,"
14149,JOHN MILTON[AA],And all things in best order to invite
14150,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Noontide repast, or afternoon's repose."
14151,JOHN MILTON[AA],"O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve,"
14152,JOHN MILTON[AA],Of thy presumed return! Event perverse!
14153,JOHN MILTON[AA],Thou never from that hour in Paradise
14154,JOHN MILTON[AA],Found'st either sweet repast or sound repose.
14155,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14156,JOHN MILTON[AA],"The Fiend, questing through the garden, finds her"
14157,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14158,JOHN MILTON[AA],Veiled in a cloud of fragrance where she stood
14159,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Half-spied, so thick the roses bushing round"
14160,JOHN MILTON[AA],About her glowed.... Them she upstays
14161,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while"
14162,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Herself, though fairest unsupported flower,"
14163,JOHN MILTON[AA],"From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh."
14164,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14165,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Seeing her, Satan ""much the place admired, the person more."""
14166,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14167,JOHN MILTON[AA],"As one who, long in populous city pent,"
14168,JOHN MILTON[AA],Forth issuing on a summer's morn to breathe
14169,JOHN MILTON[AA],Among the pleasant villages and farms
14170,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight--"
14171,JOHN MILTON[AA],"The smell of grain, of tedded grass, of kine,"
14172,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Of dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound--"
14173,JOHN MILTON[AA],"If chance with nymph-like step fair virgin pass,"
14174,JOHN MILTON[AA],"What pleasing seemed, for her now pleases more,"
14175,JOHN MILTON[AA],"She most, and in her look seems all delight."
14176,JOHN MILTON[AA],Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold
14177,JOHN MILTON[AA],"This flowery plat, the sweet recess of Eve"
14178,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Thus early, thus alone."
14179,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14180,JOHN MILTON[AA],"The original serpent did not creep on the ground, but was a handsome"
14181,JOHN MILTON[AA],creature.
14182,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14183,JOHN MILTON[AA],"With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect"
14184,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass"
14185,JOHN MILTON[AA],Floated redundant. Pleasing was his shape
14186,JOHN MILTON[AA],And lovely.
14187,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14188,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Appearing before Eve with an air of worshipful admiration, and"
14189,JOHN MILTON[AA],"speaking in human language, the arch-deceiver gains her ear with"
14190,JOHN MILTON[AA],"flattery. ""Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve."" She asks how"
14191,JOHN MILTON[AA],"it is that man's language is pronounced by ""tongue of brute."" The"
14192,JOHN MILTON[AA],reply is that the power came through eating the fruit of a certain
14193,JOHN MILTON[AA],"tree, which gave him reason, and also constrained him to worship her"
14194,JOHN MILTON[AA],"as ""sovran of creatures."" Asked to show her the tree, he leads her"
14195,JOHN MILTON[AA],"swiftly to the Tree of Prohibition, and replying to her scruples and"
14196,JOHN MILTON[AA],"fears, declares--"
14197,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14198,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""Queen of the Universe! Do not believe"
14199,JOHN MILTON[AA],Those rigid threats of death. Ye shall not die.
14200,JOHN MILTON[AA],How should ye? By the fruit? It gives you life
14201,JOHN MILTON[AA],To knowledge. By the Threatener? Look on me--
14202,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Me who have touched and tasted, yet both live"
14203,JOHN MILTON[AA],And life more perfect have attained than Fate
14204,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot."
14205,JOHN MILTON[AA],Shall that be shut to Man which to the Beast
14206,JOHN MILTON[AA],Is open? Or will God incense his ire
14207,JOHN MILTON[AA],For such a petty trespass?...
14208,JOHN MILTON[AA],God therefore cannot hurt ye and be just.
14209,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Goddess humane, reach, then, and freely taste!"""
14210,JOHN MILTON[AA],He ended; and his words replete with guile
14211,JOHN MILTON[AA],Into her heart too easy entrance won.
14212,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14213,JOHN MILTON[AA],Eve herself then took up the argument and repeated admiringly the
14214,JOHN MILTON[AA],Serpent's persuasions.
14215,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14216,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""In the day we eat"
14217,JOHN MILTON[AA],Of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die!
14218,JOHN MILTON[AA],"How dies the Serpent? He hath eaten and lives,"
14219,JOHN MILTON[AA],"And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,"
14220,JOHN MILTON[AA],Irrational till then. For us alone
14221,JOHN MILTON[AA],Was death invented? Or to us denied
14222,JOHN MILTON[AA],"This intellectual food, for beasts reserved?"
14223,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Here grows the care of all, this fruit divine,"
14224,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Fair to the eye, inviting to the taste,"
14225,JOHN MILTON[AA],Of virtue to make wise. What hinders then
14226,JOHN MILTON[AA],"To reach and feed at once both body and mind?"""
14227,JOHN MILTON[AA],"So saying, her rash hand in evil hour"
14228,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Forth-reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she ate."
14229,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat,"
14230,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe"
14231,JOHN MILTON[AA],That all was lost. Back to the thicket slunk
14232,JOHN MILTON[AA],The guilty serpent.
14233,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14234,JOHN MILTON[AA],"At first elated by the fruit, Eve presently began to reflect, excuse"
14235,JOHN MILTON[AA],"herself, and wonder what the effect would be on Adam."
14236,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14237,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""And I perhaps am secret. Heaven is high--"
14238,JOHN MILTON[AA],"High, and remote to see from thence distinct"
14239,JOHN MILTON[AA],Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps
14240,JOHN MILTON[AA],May have diverted from continual watch
14241,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Our great Forbidder, safe with all his spies"
14242,JOHN MILTON[AA],About him. But to Adam in what sort
14243,JOHN MILTON[AA],Shall I appear? Shall I to him make known
14244,JOHN MILTON[AA],As yet my change?
14245,JOHN MILTON[AA],But what if God have seen
14246,JOHN MILTON[AA],And death ensue? Then I shall be no more;
14247,JOHN MILTON[AA],"And Adam, wedded to another Eve,"
14248,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct!"
14249,JOHN MILTON[AA],"A death to think! Confirmed then, I resolve"
14250,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe,"
14251,JOHN MILTON[AA],So dear I love him that with him all deaths
14252,JOHN MILTON[AA],"I could endure, without him live no life."""
14253,JOHN MILTON[AA],Adam the while
14254,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Waiting desirous her return, had wove"
14255,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn"
14256,JOHN MILTON[AA],Her tresses.... Soon as he heard
14257,JOHN MILTON[AA],"The fatal trespass done by Eve amazed,"
14258,JOHN MILTON[AA],From his slack hand the garland wreathed for her
14259,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Down dropt, and all the faded roses shed."
14260,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length,"
14261,JOHN MILTON[AA],First to himself he inward silence broke:
14262,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""O fairest of creation, last and best"
14263,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Of all God's works, creature in whom excelled"
14264,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Whatever came to sight or thought be formed,"
14265,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet,"
14266,JOHN MILTON[AA],How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost!
14267,JOHN MILTON[AA],Some cursed fraud
14268,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Of enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown,"
14269,JOHN MILTON[AA],And me with thee hath ruined; for with thee
14270,JOHN MILTON[AA],Certain my resolution is to die.
14271,JOHN MILTON[AA],How can I live without thee? How forego
14272,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined,"
14273,JOHN MILTON[AA],"To live again in these wild words forlorn?"""
14274,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14275,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Then, turning to Eve, he tries to comfort her."
14276,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14277,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""Perhaps thou shalt not die ..."
14278,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,"
14279,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy"
14280,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Us, His prime creatures, dignified so high,"
14281,JOHN MILTON[AA],Set over all his works....
14282,JOHN MILTON[AA],"However, I with thee have fixed my lot,"
14283,JOHN MILTON[AA],Certain to undergo like doom. If death
14284,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Consort with thee, death is to me as life."
14285,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Our state cannot be severed; we are one."""
14286,JOHN MILTON[AA],So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied:
14287,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""O glorious trial of exceeding love,"
14288,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Illustrious evidence, example high!"""
14289,JOHN MILTON[AA],"So saying she embraced him, and for joy"
14290,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Tenderly wept, much won that he his love"
14291,JOHN MILTON[AA],Had so ennobled as of choice to incur
14292,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Divine displeasure for her sake, or death."
14293,JOHN MILTON[AA],In recompense ...
14294,JOHN MILTON[AA],She gave him of that fair enticing fruit
14295,JOHN MILTON[AA],With liberal hand. He scrupled not to eat
14296,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Against his better knowledge, not deceived,"
14297,JOHN MILTON[AA],But fondly overcome with female charm.
14298,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14299,JOHN MILTON[AA],The effect of the fruit on them is first to excite lust with guilty
14300,JOHN MILTON[AA],"shame following, and realising this after ""the exhilarating vapour"
14301,JOHN MILTON[AA],"bland"" had spent its force, Adam found utterance for his remorse."
14302,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14303,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear"
14304,JOHN MILTON[AA],To that false Worm....
14305,JOHN MILTON[AA],... How shall I behold the face
14306,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Henceforth of God or Angel, erst with joy"
14307,JOHN MILTON[AA],And rapture so oft beheld? Those Heavenly shapes
14308,JOHN MILTON[AA],Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze
14309,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Insufferably bright. Oh, might I here"
14310,JOHN MILTON[AA],"In solitude live savage, in some glade"
14311,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Obscured, where highest winds, impenetrable"
14312,JOHN MILTON[AA],"To star or sunlight, spread their umbrage broad,"
14313,JOHN MILTON[AA],"And brown as evening! Cover me, ye pines!"
14314,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Ye cedars, with innumerable boughs"
14315,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Hide me, where I may never see them more!"""
14316,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14317,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Then they cower in the woods, and clothe themselves with leaves."
14318,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14319,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Covered, but not at rest or ease of mind"
14320,JOHN MILTON[AA],They sat them down to weep.
14321,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14322,JOHN MILTON[AA],"But passion also took possession of them, and they began to taunt each"
14323,JOHN MILTON[AA],"other with recriminations. Adam, with estranged look, exclaimed:"
14324,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14325,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""Would thou hadst hearkened to my words, and stayed"
14326,JOHN MILTON[AA],"With me, as I besought thee, when that strange"
14327,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn,"
14328,JOHN MILTON[AA],I know not whence possessed thee! We had then
14329,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Remained still happy!"""
14330,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14331,JOHN MILTON[AA],Eve retorts:

14333,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent,"
14334,JOHN MILTON[AA],"Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me."""
14335,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14336,JOHN MILTON[AA],Then Adam:
14337,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14338,JOHN MILTON[AA],"""What could I more?"
14339,JOHN MILTON[AA],"I warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold"
14340,JOHN MILTON[AA],"The danger, and the lurking enemy"
14341,JOHN MILTON[AA],"That lay in wait; beyond this had been force."""
14342,JOHN MILTON[AA],
14343,JOHN MILTON[AA],Thus they in mutual accusation spent
14344,JOHN MILTON[AA],"The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning;"
14345,JOHN MILTON[AA],And of their vain contest appeared no end.

14885,MESSENGER,"Enough, and more, the burden of that fault;"
14886,MESSENGER,"Bitterly hast thou paid, and still art paying,"
14887,MESSENGER,That rigid score. A worse thing yet remains;
14888,MESSENGER,This day the Philistines a popular feast
14889,MESSENGER,"Here celebrate in Gaza, and proclaim"
14890,MESSENGER,"Great pomp, and sacrifice, and praises loud,"
14891,MESSENGER,"To Dagon, as their god who hath delivered"
14892,MESSENGER,"Thee, Samson, bound and blind, into their hands."
14893,MESSENGER,
14894,MESSENGER,"SAMSON: Father, I do acknowledge and confess"
14895,MESSENGER,"That I this honour, I this pomp, have brought"
14896,MESSENGER,"To Dagon, and advanced his praises high"
14897,MESSENGER,Among the heathen round. The contest is now
14898,MESSENGER,"'Twixt God and Dagon. Dagon hath presumed,"
14899,MESSENGER,"Me overthrown, to enter lists with God."
14900,MESSENGER,"Dagon must stoop, and shall ere long receive"
14901,MESSENGER,Such a discomfit as shall quite despoil him
14902,MESSENGER,"Of all these boasted trophies won on me,"
14903,MESSENGER,And with confusion blank his worshippers.
14904,MESSENGER,
14905,MESSENGER,MANOA: But for thee what shall be done?
14906,MESSENGER,"Thou must not in the meanwhile, here forgot,"
14907,MESSENGER,"Lie in this miserable, loathsome plight,"
14908,MESSENGER,Neglected. I already have made way
14909,MESSENGER,"To some Philistine lords, with whom to treat"
14910,MESSENGER,About thy ransom.
14911,MESSENGER,
14912,MESSENGER,"SAMSON: Spare that proposal, father; let me here"
14913,MESSENGER,"As I deserve, pay on my punishment,"
14914,MESSENGER,"And expiate, if possible, my crime."
14915,MESSENGER,
14916,MESSENGER,"MANOA: Be penitent, and for thy fault contrite;"
14917,MESSENGER,"But act not in thy own affliction, son."
14918,MESSENGER,Repent the sin; but if the punishment
14919,MESSENGER,"Thou canst avoid, self-preservation bids."
14920,MESSENGER,
14921,MESSENGER,SAMSON: Nature within me seems
14922,MESSENGER,In all her functions weary of herself;
14923,MESSENGER,"My race of glory run, and race of shame,"
14924,MESSENGER,And I shall shortly be with them that rest.
14925,MESSENGER,
14926,MESSENGER,"MANOA:                                   I, however,"
14927,MESSENGER,Must not omit a father's timely care
14928,MESSENGER,To prosecute the means of thy deliverance
14929,MESSENGER,"By ransom, or how else."
14930,MESSENGER,
14931,MESSENGER,CHORUS: But who is this? what thing of sea or land--
14932,MESSENGER,Female of sex it seems--
14933,MESSENGER,"That, so bedecked, ornate, and gay,"
14934,MESSENGER,Comes this way sailing?
14935,MESSENGER,Some rich Philistian matron she may seem;
14936,MESSENGER,And now at nearer view no other certain
14937,MESSENGER,"Than Dalila, thy wife."
14938,MESSENGER,
14939,MESSENGER,SAMSON: My wife! My traitress! Let her not come near me.
14940,MESSENGER,
14941,MESSENGER,DALILA: With doubtful feet and wavering resolution
14942,MESSENGER,"I came, still dreading thy displeasure, Samson."
14943,MESSENGER,
14944,MESSENGER,"SAMSON: Out, out, hyena! These are thy wonted arts,"
14945,MESSENGER,And arts of every woman false like thee--
14946,MESSENGER,"To break all faith, all vows, deceive, betray;"
14947,MESSENGER,"Then, as repentant, to submit, beseech"
14948,MESSENGER,"A reconcilement, move with feigned remorse."
14949,MESSENGER,
14950,MESSENGER,"DALILA: Let me obtain forgiveness of thee, Samson,"
14951,MESSENGER,"I to the lords will intercede, not doubting"
14952,MESSENGER,"Their favourable ear, that I may fetch thee"
14953,MESSENGER,"From forth this loathsome prison-house, to abide"
14954,MESSENGER,"With me, where my redoubled love and care,"
14955,MESSENGER,"With nursing diligence, to me glad office,"
14956,MESSENGER,May ever tend about thee to old age.
14957,MESSENGER,
14958,MESSENGER,"SAMSON: No, no; of my condition take no care;"
14959,MESSENGER,It fits not; thou and I long since are twain;
14960,MESSENGER,Nor think me so unwary or accursed
14961,MESSENGER,To bring my feet again into the snare
14962,MESSENGER,Where once I have been caught.
14963,MESSENGER,
14964,MESSENGER,"DALILA: Let me approach at least, and touch thy hand."
14965,MESSENGER,
14966,MESSENGER,"SAMSON: Not for thy life, lest fierce remembrance wake"
14967,MESSENGER,My sudden rage to tear thee joint by joint.
14968,MESSENGER,At distance I forgive thee; go with that;
14969,MESSENGER,"Bewail thy falsehood, and the pious works"
14970,MESSENGER,It hath brought forth to make thee memorable
14971,MESSENGER,"Among illustrious women, faithful wives."
14972,MESSENGER,
14973,MESSENGER,"DALILA: I see thou art implacable, more deaf"
14974,MESSENGER,To prayers than winds and seas. Yet winds to seas
14975,MESSENGER,"Are reconciled at length, and sea to shore."
14976,MESSENGER,"My name, perhaps, among the circumcised"
14977,MESSENGER,"In Dan, in Judah, and the bordering tribes"
14978,MESSENGER,To all posterity may stand defamed.
14979,MESSENGER,"But in my country, where I most desire,"
14980,MESSENGER,I shall be named among the famousest
14981,MESSENGER,"Of women, sung at solemn festivals,"
14982,MESSENGER,"Living and dead recorded, who to save"
14983,MESSENGER,"Her country from a fierce destroyer, chose"
14984,MESSENGER,Above the faith of wedlock bands; my tomb
14985,MESSENGER,With odours visited and annual flowers.
14986,MESSENGER,
14987,MESSENGER,CHORUS: She's gone--a manifest serpent by her sting--
14988,MESSENGER,"Discovered in the end, till now concealed."
14989,MESSENGER,"This idol's day hath been to thee no day of rest,"
14990,MESSENGER,Labouring thy mind
14991,MESSENGER,More than the working day thy hands.
14992,MESSENGER,"And yet, perhaps, more trouble is behind;"
14993,MESSENGER,For I descry this way
14994,MESSENGER,Some other tending; in his hand
14995,MESSENGER,"A sceptre or quaint staff he bears,"
14996,MESSENGER,"A public officer, and now at hand."
14997,MESSENGER,His message will be short and voluble.
14998,MESSENGER,
14999,MESSENGER,"OFFICER: Hebrews, the prisoner Samson here I seek."
15000,MESSENGER,
15001,MESSENGER,CHORUS: His manacles remark him; there he sits.
15002,MESSENGER,
15003,MESSENGER,"OFFICER: Samson, to thee our lords thus bid me say."
15004,MESSENGER,"This day to Dagon is a solemn feast,"
15005,MESSENGER,"With sacrifices, triumph, pomp, and games;"
15006,MESSENGER,"Thy strength they know surpassing human rate,"
15007,MESSENGER,And now some public proof thereof require
15008,MESSENGER,To honour this great feast and great assembly.
15009,MESSENGER,"Rise, therefore, with all speed, and come along,"
15010,MESSENGER,"Where I will see thee heartened and fresh clad,"
15011,MESSENGER,To appear as fit before the illustrious lords.
15012,MESSENGER,
15013,MESSENGER,SAMSON: Thou know'st I am an Hebrew; therefore tell them
15014,MESSENGER,Our law forbids at their religious rites
15015,MESSENGER,My presence; for that cause I cannot come.
15016,MESSENGER,
15017,MESSENGER,"OFFICER: This answer, be assured will not content them."
15018,MESSENGER,
15019,MESSENGER,SAMSON: Return the way thou camest;
15020,MESSENGER,I will not come.
15021,MESSENGER,
15022,MESSENGER,OFFICER: Regard thyself; this will offend them highly.
15023,MESSENGER,
15024,MESSENGER,"SAMSON: Can they think me so broken, so debased"
15025,MESSENGER,"With corporal servitude, that my mind ever"
15026,MESSENGER,Will condescend to such absurd commands?
15027,MESSENGER,Joined with extreme contempt! I will not come.
15028,MESSENGER,
15029,MESSENGER,OFFICER: I am sorry what this stoutness will produce.
15030,MESSENGER,
15031,MESSENGER,"CHORUS: He's gone, and who knows how he may report"
15032,MESSENGER,Thy words by adding fuel to the flames.
15033,MESSENGER,Expect another message more imperious.
15034,MESSENGER,
15035,MESSENGER,SAMSON: Shall I abuse this consecrated gift
15036,MESSENGER,"Of strength, again returning with my hair,"
15037,MESSENGER,After my great transgression!--so requite
15038,MESSENGER,"Favour renewed, and add a greater sin"
15039,MESSENGER,By prostituting holy things to idols.
15040,MESSENGER,
15041,MESSENGER,"CHORUS: Where the heart joins not, outward acts defile not."
15042,MESSENGER,
15043,MESSENGER,SAMSON: Be of good courage; I begin to feel
15044,MESSENGER,"Some rousing motions in me, which dispose"
15045,MESSENGER,To something extraordinary my thoughts.
15046,MESSENGER,I with this messenger will go along--
15047,MESSENGER,"If there be aught of presage in the mind,"
15048,MESSENGER,This day will be remarkable in my life
15049,MESSENGER,"By some great act, or of my days the last."
15050,MESSENGER,
15051,MESSENGER,CHORUS: In time thou hast resolved: the man returns.
15052,MESSENGER,
15053,MESSENGER,"OFFICER: Samson, this second message from our lords"
15054,MESSENGER,"To thee I am bid say: Art thou our slave,"
15055,MESSENGER,"And dar'st thou, at our sending and command,"
15056,MESSENGER,Dispute thy coming? Come without delay;
15057,MESSENGER,Or we shall find such engines to assail
15058,MESSENGER,"And hamper thee, as thou shalt come of force,"
15059,MESSENGER,Though thou wert firmlier fastened than a rock.
15060,MESSENGER,
15061,MESSENGER,SAMSON: Because they shall not trail me through their streets
15062,MESSENGER,"Like a wild beast, I am content to go."
15063,MESSENGER,
15064,MESSENGER,OFFICER: I praise thy resolution. Doff these links:
15065,MESSENGER,By this compliance thou wilt win the lords
15066,MESSENGER,"To favour, and perhaps to set thee free."
15067,MESSENGER,
15068,MESSENGER,"SAMSON: Brethren, farewell. Your company along"
15069,MESSENGER,"I will not wish, lest it perhaps offend them"
15070,MESSENGER,To see me girt with friends.
15071,MESSENGER,"Happen what may, of me expect to hear"
15072,MESSENGER,"Nothing dishonourable, impure, unworthy"
15073,MESSENGER,"Our God, our Law, my nation, or myself."
15074,MESSENGER,
15075,MESSENGER,"CHORUS: Go, and the Holy One"
15076,MESSENGER,Of Israel be thy guide.
15077,MESSENGER,
15078,MESSENGER,"MANOA: Peace with you, brethren! My inducement hither"
15079,MESSENGER,Was not at present here to find my son.
15080,MESSENGER,By order of the lords new parted hence
15081,MESSENGER,To come and play before them at their feast.
15082,MESSENGER,"I heard all as I came; I had no will,"
15083,MESSENGER,Lest I should see him forced to things unseemly.
15084,MESSENGER,But that which moved my coming now was chiefly
15085,MESSENGER,To give ye part with me what hope I have
15086,MESSENGER,With good success to work his liberty.
15087,MESSENGER,
15088,MESSENGER,CHORUS: That hope would much rejoice us to partake
15089,MESSENGER,With thee.
15090,MESSENGER,
15091,MESSENGER,MANOA: What noise or shout was that? It tore the sky.
15092,MESSENGER,
15093,MESSENGER,CHORUS: Doubtless the people shouting to behold
15094,MESSENGER,"Their once great dread, captive and blind before them,"
15095,MESSENGER,"Or at some proof of strength, before them shown."
15096,MESSENGER,
15097,MESSENGER,"MANOA: His ransom, if my whole inheritance"
15098,MESSENGER,"May compass it, shall willingly be paid"
15099,MESSENGER,And numbered down. Much rather I shall choose
15100,MESSENGER,"To live the poorest in my tribe, than richest,"
15101,MESSENGER,And he in that calamitous prison left.
15102,MESSENGER,"No, I am fixed not to part hence without him."
15103,MESSENGER,"For his redemption all my patrimony,"
15104,MESSENGER,"If need be, I am ready to forego"
15105,MESSENGER,"And quit. Not wanting him, I shall want nothing."
15106,MESSENGER,"It shall be my delight to tend his eyes,"
15107,MESSENGER,"And view him sitting in his house, ennobled"
15108,MESSENGER,With all those high exploits by him achieved.
15109,MESSENGER,
15110,MESSENGER,"CHORUS: Thy hopes are not ill founded, nor seem vain,"
15111,MESSENGER,Of his delivery.
15112,MESSENGER,
15113,MESSENGER,"MANOA: I know your friendly minds, and--O what noise!"
15114,MESSENGER,Mercy of Heaven! What hideous noise was that
15115,MESSENGER,"Horribly loud, unlike the former shout."
15116,MESSENGER,
15117,MESSENGER,"CHORUS: Noise call you it, or universal groan,"
15118,MESSENGER,As if the whole inhabitation perished?
15119,MESSENGER,"Blood, death, and deathful deeds, are in that noise,"
15120,MESSENGER,"Ruin, destruction at the utmost point."
15121,MESSENGER,
15122,MESSENGER,MANOA: Of ruin indeed methought I heard the noise.
15123,MESSENGER,Oh! it continues; the have slain my son.
15124,MESSENGER,CHORUS: Thy son is rather slaying them; that outcry
15125,MESSENGER,From slaughter of one foe could not ascend.
15126,MESSENGER,
15127,MESSENGER,MANOA: Some dismal accident it needs must be.

15129,MESSENGER,
15130,MESSENGER,"CHORUS: Best keep together here, lest, running thither,"
15131,MESSENGER,We unawares run into danger's mouth.
15132,MESSENGER,This evil on the Philistines is fallen:
15133,MESSENGER,From whom could else a general cry be heard?
15134,MESSENGER,
15135,MESSENGER,MANOA: A little stay will bring some notice hither.
15136,MESSENGER,
15137,MESSENGER,CHORUS: I see one hither speeding--
15138,MESSENGER,"An Hebrew, as I guess, and of our tribe."
15139,MESSENGER,
15140,MESSENGER,"MESSENGER: O, whither shall I run, or which way fly?"
15141,MESSENGER,"The sight of this so horrid spectacle,"
15142,MESSENGER,"Which erst my eyes beheld, and yet behold?"
15143,MESSENGER,
15144,MESSENGER,"MANOA: The accident was loud, and here before thee"
15145,MESSENGER,With rueful cry; yet what it was we know not.
15146,MESSENGER,"Tell us the sum, the circumstance defer."
15147,MESSENGER,
15148,MESSENGER,"MESSENGER: Gaza yet stands; but all her sons are fallen,"
15149,MESSENGER,All in a moment overwhelmed and fallen.
15150,MESSENGER,
15151,MESSENGER,MANOA: Sad! but thou know'st to Israelites not saddest
15152,MESSENGER,The desolation of a hostile city.
15153,MESSENGER,
15154,MESSENGER,MESSENGER: Feed on that first; there may in grief be surfeit.
15155,MESSENGER,
15156,MESSENGER,MANOA: Relate by whom.
15157,MESSENGER,
15158,MESSENGER,MESSENGER:             By Samson.
15159,MESSENGER,
15160,MESSENGER,MANOA:                         That still lessens
15161,MESSENGER,The sorrow and converts it nigh to joy.
15162,MESSENGER,
15163,MESSENGER,"MESSENGER: Ah! Manoa, I refrain too suddenly"
15164,MESSENGER,"To utter what will come at last too soon,"
15165,MESSENGER,"Lest evil tidings, with too rude eruption"
15166,MESSENGER,"Hitting thy aged ear, should pierce too deep."
15167,MESSENGER,
15168,MESSENGER,MANOA: Suspense in news is torture; speak them out.
15169,MESSENGER,
15170,MESSENGER,MESSENGER: Then take the worst in brief--Samson is dead.
15171,MESSENGER,
15172,MESSENGER,"MANOA: The worst indeed! O, all my hope's defeated"
15173,MESSENGER,"To free him hence! but Death, who sets all free,"
15174,MESSENGER,Hath paid his ransom now and full discharge.
15175,MESSENGER,How died he?--death to life is crown or shame.
15176,MESSENGER,"All by him fell, thou say'st; by whom fell he?"
15177,MESSENGER,What glorious hand gave Samson his death's wound?
15178,MESSENGER,
15179,MESSENGER,MESSENGER: Unwounded of his enemies he fell.
15180,MESSENGER,
15181,MESSENGER,"MANOA: Wearied with slaughter, then, or how? Explain."
15182,MESSENGER,
15183,MESSENGER,MESSENGER: By his own hands.
15184,MESSENGER,
15185,MESSENGER,MANOA:                 Self-violence! What cause
15186,MESSENGER,Brought him so soon at variance with himself
15187,MESSENGER,Among his foes?
15188,MESSENGER,
15189,MESSENGER,MESSENGER:           Inevitable cause--
15190,MESSENGER,At once both to destroy and be destroyed.
15191,MESSENGER,"The edifice, where all were met to see him,"
15192,MESSENGER,Upon their heads and on his own he pulled.
15193,MESSENGER,"The building was a spacious theatre,"
15194,MESSENGER,"Half round on two main pillars vaulted high,"
15195,MESSENGER,"With seats where all the lords, and each degree"
15196,MESSENGER,"Of sort, might sit in order to behold."
15197,MESSENGER,Immediately
15198,MESSENGER,"Was Samson as a public servant brought,"
15199,MESSENGER,In their state livery clad.
15200,MESSENGER,At sight of him the people with a shout
15201,MESSENGER,"Rifted the air, clamoring their god with praise,"
15202,MESSENGER,Who had made their dreadful enemy their thrall.
15203,MESSENGER,"He patient, but undaunted, where they led him,"
15204,MESSENGER,"Came to the place; and what was set before him,"
15205,MESSENGER,"Which without help of eye might be assayed,"
15206,MESSENGER,"To heave, pull, draw, or break, he still performed"
15207,MESSENGER,"All with incredible, stupendous force,"
15208,MESSENGER,None daring to appear antagonist
15209,MESSENGER,"At length, for intermission sake, they led him"
15210,MESSENGER,"Between the pillars; he his guide requested,"
15211,MESSENGER,"As over-tired, to let him lean awhile"
15212,MESSENGER,"With both his arms on those two massy pillars,"
15213,MESSENGER,That to the arched roof gave main support.
15214,MESSENGER,He unsuspicious led him; which when Samson
15215,MESSENGER,"Felt in his arms, with head awhile inclined,"
15216,MESSENGER,"And eyes fast fixed, he stood, as one who prayed,"
15217,MESSENGER,Or some great matter in his mind revolved.
15218,MESSENGER,"At last, with head erect, thus cried aloud,"
15219,MESSENGER,"""Hitherto, lords, what your commands imposed"
15220,MESSENGER,"I have performed, as reason was, obeying,"
15221,MESSENGER,Not without wonder or delight beheld;
15222,MESSENGER,"Now, of my own accord, such other trial"
15223,MESSENGER,I mean to show you of my strength yet greater
15224,MESSENGER,"As with amaze shall strike all who behold."""
15225,MESSENGER,"This uttered, straightening all his nerves, he bowed."
15226,MESSENGER,As with the force of winds and waters pent
15227,MESSENGER,"When mountains tremble, those two massy pillars"
15228,MESSENGER,With horrible convulsions to and fro
15229,MESSENGER,"He tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew"
15230,MESSENGER,The whole roof after them with burst of thunder
15231,MESSENGER,"Upon the heads of all who sat beneath,"
15232,MESSENGER,"Lords, ladies, captains, counsellors, or priests,"
15233,MESSENGER,"Their choice nobility and flower, not only"
15234,MESSENGER,"Of this, but each Philistian city round,"
15235,MESSENGER,Met from all parts to solemnise this feast.
15236,MESSENGER,"Samson, with these immixed, inevitably"
15237,MESSENGER,Pulled down the same destruction on himself;
15238,MESSENGER,"The vulgar only scaped, who stood without."
15239,MESSENGER,
15240,MESSENGER,MANOA:         Samson hath quit himself
15241,MESSENGER,"Like Samson, and heroically hath finished"
15242,MESSENGER,A life heroic.
15243,MESSENGER,"Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail"
15244,MESSENGER,"Or knock the breast; no weakness, no contempt,"
15245,MESSENGER,"Dispraise or blame; nothing but well and fair,"
15246,MESSENGER,And what may quiet us in a death so noble.
15247,MESSENGER,Let us go find the body where it lies.
15248,MESSENGER,
15249,MESSENGER,"I, with what speed the while"
15250,MESSENGER,"Will send for all my kindred, all my friends,"
15251,MESSENGER,"To fetch him hence, and solemnly attend,"
15252,MESSENGER,"With silent obsequy and funeral train,"
15253,MESSENGER,Home to his father's house. There will I build him
15254,MESSENGER,"A monument, and plant it round with shade"
15255,MESSENGER,"Of laurel evergreen and branching palm,"
15256,MESSENGER,"With all his trophies hung, and acts enrolled"
15257,MESSENGER,"In copious legend, or sweet lyric song."
15258,MESSENGER,"Thither shall all the valiant youth resort,"
15259,MESSENGER,And from his memory inflame their breasts
15260,MESSENGER,To matchless valour and adventures high.

15374,ACT I,tell me how this

15381,ACT I,
15382,ACT I,SGANARELLE: All our best authorities will tell you that
15383,ACT I,it is an impediment in the action of her tongue.
15384,ACT I,
15385,ACT I,"GÉRONTE: But, nevertheless, let us have your opinion on"
15386,ACT I,this impediment in the action of her tongue.
15387,ACT I,
15388,ACT I,SGANARELLE: I hold that this impediment in the
15389,ACT I,"action of her tongue is caused by certain humours,"
15390,ACT I,which among us learned men are called peccant humours.
15391,ACT I,For as the vapours formed by the exhalations of the

15404,ACT I,"Quare_? ""Why?"" _Luia substantivo et adjectivum"

15406,ACT I,
15407,ACT I,GÉRONTE: Oh! Why did I not study?
15408,ACT I,
15409,ACT I,JACQUELINE: What a clever man he is!
15410,ACT I,
15411,ACT I,SGANARELLE: Thus these vapours of which I speak
15412,ACT I,"passing from the left side, where the liver is, to the right"
15413,ACT I,"side where the heart is, it happens that the lungs, which"
15414,ACT I,"we call in Latin _armyan_, having communication with the"
15415,ACT I,"brain, which in Greek we name _nasmus_, by means of the"
15416,ACT I,"_vena cava_, which we call in Hebrew _cubile_, in their way"
15417,ACT I,"meet the said vapours, which fill the ventricles of the"
15418,ACT I,omoplata; and as the said vapours--be sure you understand
15419,ACT I,"this argument, I beg you--and as these said vapours have"
15420,ACT I,"a certain malignancy--listen carefully to this, I pray you."
15421,ACT I,
15422,ACT I,GÉRONTE: Yes.
15423,ACT I,
15424,ACT I,SGANARELLE: Are gifted with a certain malignancy
15425,ACT I,which is caused--please pay attention----
15426,ACT I,
15427,ACT I,GÉRONTE: I am doing so.
15428,ACT I,
15429,ACT I,SGANARELLE: Which is caused by the acridity of the
15430,ACT I,"humour engendered in the concavity of the diaphragm, it"
15431,ACT I,"happens that these vapours--_Ossabundus, nequezs, nequer,"
15432,ACT I,"potarinum, quipsa milus_. That is just what makes your"
15433,ACT I,daughter dumb.
15434,ACT I,
15435,ACT I,"GÉRONTE: No one, doubtless, could argue better."
15436,ACT I,There is but one thing that puzzles me. It seems to me
15437,ACT I,that you place the heart and liver differently from where
15438,ACT I,"they are; the heart is on the left side, and the liver on"
15439,ACT I,the right.
15440,ACT I,
15441,ACT I,"SGANARELLE: Yes, that was so formerly; but we have"
15442,ACT I,"changed all that, and nowadays we practise medicine by"
15443,ACT I,an entirely new method.
15444,ACT I,
15445,ACT I,GÉRONTE: I did not know that. I must ask you to
15446,ACT I,pardon my ignorance.
15447,ACT I,
15448,ACT I,SGANARELLE: There is no harm done. You are not
15449,ACT I,obliged to be as clever as we are.
15450,ACT I,
15451,ACT I,"GÉRONTE: Certainly not. But what do you think,"
15452,ACT I,"monsieur, ought to be done for this complaint?"
15453,ACT I,
15454,ACT I,SGANARELLE: My advice is that she should be put to
15455,ACT I,"bed, and, for a remedy, you must see that she takes plenty"
15456,ACT I,of bread soaked in wine.
15457,ACT I,
15458,ACT I,"GÉRONTE: Why so, monsieur?"
15459,ACT I,
15460,ACT I,SGANARELLE: Because in bread and wine mixed together
15461,ACT I,there is a sympathetic virtue which causes speech.
15462,ACT I,"Don't you know that they give nothing else to parrots,"
15463,ACT I,and that they learn to speak by being fed on this diet?
15464,ACT I,
15465,ACT I,GÉRONTE: That is true. What a great man you are!
15466,ACT I,"Quick, bring plenty of bread and wine."
15467,ACT I,
15468,ACT I,SGANARELLE: I shall come back at night to see how
15469,ACT I,she is getting on.

15473,ACT I,SGANARELLE: What do you want?
15474,ACT I,
15475,ACT I,"GÉRONTE: To give you your fee, monsieur."
15476,ACT I,
15477,ACT I,SGANARELLE (_holding out his hand from under his
15478,ACT I,"gown, while Géronte opens his purse_): I shall not take it,"
15479,ACT I,monsieur.
15480,ACT I,
15481,ACT I,GÉRONTE: I beseech you.
15482,ACT I,
15483,ACT I,SGANARELLE: You are jesting.
15484,ACT I,
15485,ACT I,GÉRONTE: That is settled.
15486,ACT I,
15487,ACT I,SGANARELLE: I will not.
15488,ACT I,
15489,ACT I,GÉRONTE: What!
15490,ACT I,
15491,ACT I,SGANARELLE: I don't practise for money.
15492,ACT I,
15493,ACT I,GÉRONTE: I am sure you don't.

15495,ACT I,SGANARELLE (_after having taken the money_): Is it
15496,ACT I,good weight?
15497,ACT I,
15498,ACT I,"GÉRONTE: Yes, monsieur."

15522,ACT II,"his conversation, ridicules the notion, and says that a medical dress"
15523,ACT II,"is quite sufficient disguise. ""I am resolved to stick to physic all my"
15524,ACT II,"life,"" says Sganarelle. ""I find that it is the best line of all; for"
15525,ACT II,"whatever we do, right or wrong, we are paid, all the same. Blunders"
15526,ACT II,make no odds to us; we cut away the material we have to work with as
15527,ACT II,"we choose. A shoemaker, in making a pair of shoes, cannot spoil a"
15528,ACT II,scrap of leather without having to pay for it; but in this business we
15529,ACT II,can spoil a man without its costing us a cent. The mistakes are never
15530,ACT II,put down to our account; it is always the fault of the fellow who
15531,ACT II,"dies."""

15533,ACT II,"[_Enter_ JACQUELINE, LUCINDE, GÉRONTE, LÉANDRE _and_ SGANARELLE."
15534,ACT II,
15535,ACT II,"JACQUELINE: Here's your daughter, monsieur. She"
15536,ACT II,wishes to walk a bit.
15537,ACT II,
15538,ACT II,"SGANARELLE: It will do her good. Go to her, Mr."
15539,ACT II,"Apothecary, and feel her pulse, and I will consult with"
15540,ACT II,you presently about her malady. (_At this point he draws_
15541,ACT II,"GÉRONTE _to one side of the stage, puts one arm on his"
15542,ACT II,"shoulders, places his hand under his chin, and makes him"
15543,ACT II,"turn towards him, whenever_ GÉRONTE _wants to see what"
15544,ACT II,"is going on between his daughter and the apothecary,"
15545,ACT II,while he holds the following discourse with him to keep
15546,ACT II,"his attention_:) Monsieur, it is a great and subtle question"
15547,ACT II,among doctors whether women are easier to cure
15548,ACT II,than men. I beg you please listen to this. Some say
15549,ACT II,"""no,"" some say ""yes."" I say both ""yes"" and ""no"";"
15550,ACT II,for as the incongruity of the opaque humours which are
15551,ACT II,found in the natural temperament of women causes the
15552,ACT II,animal side always to struggle for mastery over the
15553,ACT II,"spiritual, we find that the inequality of their opinions"
15554,ACT II,depends on the oblique motion of the circle of the moon;
15555,ACT II,and as the sun----
15556,ACT II,
15557,ACT II,"LUCINDE: NO, I can never change my feelings."
15558,ACT II,
15559,ACT II,GÉRONTE: Hark! My daughter speaks! O the great
15560,ACT II,"virtue of physic! How deeply am I indebted to you,"
15561,ACT II,"monsieur, for this marvellous cure!"
15562,ACT II,
15563,ACT II,"SGANARELLE (_walking about the stage, wiping his"
15564,ACT II,forehead)_: It is a complaint that has given me much
15565,ACT II,trouble.
15566,ACT II,
15567,ACT II,"LUCINDE: Yes, father, I have recovered my speech;"
15568,ACT II,but I have recovered it only to tell you that I will never
15569,ACT II,have any other husband than Léandre.
15570,ACT II,
15571,ACT II,GÉRONTE: But----
15572,ACT II,
15573,ACT II,LUCINDE: Nothing will shake the resolution I have
15574,ACT II,taken.
15575,ACT II,
15576,ACT II,GÉRONTE: What----
15577,ACT II,
15578,ACT II,LUCINDE: All your excellent reasons will be in vain.
15579,ACT II,
15580,ACT II,GÉRONTE: If----
15581,ACT II,
15582,ACT II,LUCINDE: All your talk will have no effect.
15583,ACT II,
15584,GÉRONTE: I----,GÉRONTE: I----
15585,GÉRONTE: I----,
15586,GÉRONTE: I----,LUCINDE: It is a subject on which I am quite determined.
15587,GÉRONTE: I----,
15588,GÉRONTE: I----,GÉRONTE: But----
15589,GÉRONTE: I----,
15590,GÉRONTE: I----,LUCINDE: No paternal power can force me to marry
15591,GÉRONTE: I----,against my will.
15592,GÉRONTE: I----,
15593,GÉRONTE: I----,GÉRONTE: I have----
15594,GÉRONTE: I----,
15595,GÉRONTE: I----,LUCINDE: You can make every effort you like.
15596,GÉRONTE: I----,
15597,GÉRONTE: I----,GÉRONTE: It----
15598,GÉRONTE: I----,
15599,GÉRONTE: I----,LUCINDE: My heart cannot submit to such a tyranny.
15600,GÉRONTE: I----,
15601,GÉRONTE: I----,GÉRONTE: There----
15602,GÉRONTE: I----,
15603,GÉRONTE: I----,LUCINDE: And I will sooner throw myself into a convent
15604,GÉRONTE: I----,than marry a man I don't love.
15605,GÉRONTE: I----,
15606,GÉRONTE: I----,GÉRONTE: But----
15607,GÉRONTE: I----,
15608,GÉRONTE: I----,LUCINDE (_speaking in deafening tone of voice_): It
15609,GÉRONTE: I----,is no use. You waste your time. I will not do anything
15610,GÉRONTE: I----,of the kind. I am resolved.
15611,GÉRONTE: I----,
15612,GÉRONTE: I----,GÉRONTE: Ah! What a wildness of speech! I beg
15613,GÉRONTE: I----,"you, monsieur, to make her dumb again."
15614,GÉRONTE: I----,
15615,GÉRONTE: I----,SGANARELLE: That is impossible. All that I can do
15616,GÉRONTE: I----,"for you is to make you deaf, if you like."
15617,GÉRONTE: I----,
15618,GÉRONTE: I----,GÉRONTE: You shall marry Horace this very evening.
15619,GÉRONTE: I----,
15620,GÉRONTE: I----,LUCINDE: I will sooner marry death.
15621,GÉRONTE: I----,
15622,GÉRONTE: I----,SGANARELLE: Let me take this disease in hand. It
15623,GÉRONTE: I----,"is a complaint that has got hold of her, and I know the"
15624,GÉRONTE: I----,remedy to apply.
15625,GÉRONTE: I----,
15626,GÉRONTE: I----,GÉRONTE: Is it possible that you can cure this mental
15627,GÉRONTE: I----,malady also?
15628,GÉRONTE: I----,
15629,GÉRONTE: I----,SGANARELLE: Yes; let me manage it. I have remedies
15630,GÉRONTE: I----,"for everything, and our apothecary is the man for"
15631,GÉRONTE: I----,"this cure. (_He calls the apothecary, and speaks to him_.)"
15632,GÉRONTE: I----,You see that the passion she has for this Léandre is quite
15633,GÉRONTE: I----,"against the wishes of her father, and that it is necessary"
15634,GÉRONTE: I----,"to find a prompt remedy for the evil, which will only"
15635,GÉRONTE: I----,"become worse by delay. For my part, I see but one"
15636,GÉRONTE: I----,"remedy, a dose of purgative flight suitably mixed with"
15637,GÉRONTE: I----,two drachms of matrimony in pills. Go and take a little
15638,GÉRONTE: I----,"turn in the garden with her to prepare the humours,"
15639,GÉRONTE: I----,"while I talk here with her father; but, above all, lose"
15640,GÉRONTE: I----,no time. Apply the remedy at once--apply the specific
15641,GÉRONTE: I----,remedy.

15696,FOOTNOTES:,"name Molière not having been assumed until he had commenced authorship,"
15697,FOOTNOTES:,"was born at Paris, January 15, 1622. Almost nothing is known of his"
15698,FOOTNOTES:,"early life, except that in his fourteenth year he was sent to the"
15699,FOOTNOTES:,"Jesuit Collège de Clermont, in Paris, and that later he studied law. In"
15700,FOOTNOTES:,1645 he suddenly appeared upon the stage as a member of a company of
15701,FOOTNOTES:,"strolling players, and later, through the recommendation of influential"
15702,FOOTNOTES:,"friends, his company gained permission to act before the King. His"
15703,FOOTNOTES:,"comedies soon placed him in the front rank of French dramatists, and he"
15704,FOOTNOTES:,is now regarded as perhaps the greatest of all comic dramatists. Of all
15705,FOOTNOTES:,"the learned classes that fell under Molière's merciless lash, none came"
15706,FOOTNOTES:,so completely as the profession of medicine. This is especially the
15707,FOOTNOTES:,"case in ""The Doctor in Spite of Himself"" (""Lie Médecin Malgré Lui""),"
