8,,
9,,The ligatures oe and OE are indicated by [oe] and [OE].
10,,
11,,The carat (^) indicates a superscript in the original. One
12,,carat indicates that the following single letter is
13,,superscript. A pair of carats indicates that the enclosed
14,,letters are superscript; for example the abbreviations
15,,8^vo^ and 12^mo^ are used for the printer's page sizes
16,,octavo and duodecimo respectively.
17,,
18,,"In the poem ""In Etesiam Lachrymantem"" (Page 221) the"
19,,initial letter of the final line is missing in all extant
20,,"editions; either ""C"" or ""D"" seems possible."
21,,
22,,"In the Boethius translation Lib. IV. Metrum VI. (page 230),"
23,,the letter 'y' has been added to make line 9/10 read
24,,"""...though they/See other stars..."" although it is missing"
25,,in all available editions.
26,,
27,,"At many points a period, comma or hyphen seems to be"
28,,omitted in the original. Obvious typographical errors have
29,,"been corrected, but where missing punctuation is not clearly"
30,,"an error, or the omission is harmless to the sense, the text"
31,,remains as in the original.
32,,
33,,Footnotes in the original appear on the page where they are
34,,referenced and are numbered from 1 on each page. Here
35,,footnotes are numbered consecutively throughout the book and
36,,are grouped following each chapter or poem to which they
37,,refer. To locate footnote 17 (for example) search for [17].
38,,Another search for [17] returns to the point of reference.

378,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Recent inquiries into the life of Henry Vaughan have added but little to
379,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,the information already contained in the memoirs of Mr. Lyte and Dr.
380,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Grosart. I have, however, been enabled to put together a few notes on"
381,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"this somewhat obscure subject, which may be taken as supplementary to"
382,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Mr. Beeching's _Introduction_ in Vol. I. It will be well to preface them
383,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"by reprinting the account of Anthony à Wood, our chief original"
384,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"authority (_Ath. Oxon._, ed. Bliss, 1817, iv. 425):"
385,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
386,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""Henry Vaughan, called the _Silurist_ from that part of Wales whose"
387,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"inhabitants were in ancient times called Silures, brother twin (but"
388,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"elder)[1] to Eugenius Philalethes, alias Tho. Vaughan ... was born at"
389,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Newton S. Briget, lying on the river Isca, commonly called Uske, in"
390,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Brecknockshire, educated in grammar learning in his own country for six"
391,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"years under one Matthew Herbert, a noted schoolmaster of his time, made"
392,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"his first entry into Jesus College in Mich. term 1638, aged 17 years;"
393,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"where spending two years or more in logicals under a noted tutor, was"
394,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,taken thence and designed by his father for the obtaining of some
395,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,knowledge in the municipal laws at London. But soon after the civil war
396,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"beginning, to the horror of all good men, he was sent for home, followed"
397,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"the pleasant paths of poetry and philology, became noted for his"
398,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"ingenuity, and published several specimens thereof, of which his _Olor"
399,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Iscanus_ was most valued. Afterwards applying his mind to the study of
400,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"physic, became at length eminent in his own country for the practice"
401,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"thereof, and was esteemed by scholars an ingenious person, but proud and"
402,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,humorous.... [A list of Vaughan's works follows.] ... He died in the
403,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,latter end of April (about the 29th day) in sixteen hundred ninety and
404,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"five, and was buried in the parish church of Llansenfreid, about two"
405,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"miles distant from Brecknock, in Brecknockshire."""
406,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
407,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,Anthony à Wood seems to have had some personal acquaintance with the
408,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"poet, for in his account of Thomas Vaughan (_Ath. Oxon._ iii. 725) he"
409,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"says that ""Olor Iscanus sent me a catalogue of his brother's works."""

414,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Henry Vaughan's descent from the Vaughans of Tretower, County Brecon,"
415,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,has been accurately traced by Dr. Grosart and others. Little has been
416,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"hitherto known about his immediate family. Theophilus Jones, in his"
417,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"_History of Brecknockshire_ (1805-9), ii. 544, says: ""Henry Vaughan died"
418,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"in 1695, aged 75,[2] leaving by his first wife two sons and three"
419,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"daughters, and by his second a daughter Rachel, who married John"
420,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Turberville. His grand-daughter, Denys, or Dyenis, a corruption or"
421,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"abbreviation of Dyonisia, who was the daughter of Jenkin Jones of"
422,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Trebinshwn, by Luce his wife, died single in 1780, aged 92, and is"
423,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,buried in the Priory churchyard.[3] What became of the remainder of his
424,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"family, or whether they are extinct, I know not."" To this statement Mr."
425,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Lyte added nothing but some errors, and Dr. Grosart nothing but the"
426,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,following hypothesis:--
427,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
428,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"""I am inclined to think that William Vaughan, censor of the College of"
429,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Physicians, physician to William III^d., was one of the sons of our"
430,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,worthy mentioned by Mr. Lyte.... William Vaughan's 'age 20' in 1668
431,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"represents 1648 as the birth-date, and that fits in with the love-verse"
432,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"of the Poems of 1646."""
433,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,
434,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,"Mr. G. T. Clark, in his _Genealogies of Glamorgan_, p. 240, gives the"
435,BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.,following account:--

480,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"(_Genealogist_, iii. 33) has made it appear likely that this Dr."
481,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"Vaughan, who married Anne Newton, of Romford in Essex, belonged to a"

483,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,
484,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,I now proceed to confirm and illustrate the pedigrees by giving such
485,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,further facts concerning Vaughan's immediate family as I have been able
486,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"with Miss Morgan's assistance, to glean. I can trace no family of Wises"
487,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"in Staffordshire so early as the seventeenth century, nor any place in"
488,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,that county called Ritsonhall. It is possible that the R. W. of the
489,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"_Elegy_ (vol. ii., p. 79, _note_) may have been a Wise, and also that"
490,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,the connection between Vaughan and the Staffordshire Egertons may have
491,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"been through this family (vol. ii., p. 294, _note_). Vaughan's first"
492,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"wife Catharine was probably dead before 1658. Thomas Vaughan, in his"
493,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"diary (MS. Sloane, 1741, f. 106 (b)), makes mention in that year of"
494,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"""eyewater made at the Pinner of Wakefield by my dear wife and my Sister"
495,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"Vaughan, who are both now with God."" The second wife, Elizabeth,"
496,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,survived her husband. Administration of his goods was granted to her as
497,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"the widow of an intestate in May, 1695.[5] The fine old manor-house at"
498,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"Newton was pulled down by a stupid land-agent within the memory of man,"
499,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,but a stone has been found built into the wall of a house half-a-mile
500,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"from the site, bearing the inscription ""H^VE, 1689."" This may well"
501,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,stand for H[enry and] E[lizabeth] V[aughan]. Newton probably passed to
502,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,the poet's eldest son Thomas and his wife Frances.[6] Of their
503,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"descendants, if any, we know nothing. There was a William Vaughan of"
504,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"Llansantffread who, later than 1714, married Mary Games of Tregaer in"
505,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"Llanfrynach. But this was probably a Vaughan not of Newton, but of"
506,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"Scethrog, also in Llansantffread (_cf._ footnote to p. xxv. below.) In"
507,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,1733 William Vaughan was churchwarden of Llanfrynach. In 1740 William
508,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,Vaughan of Tregaer was high sheriff of Brecknock. In 1760 Tregaer had
509,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,passed by purchase to a Mr. Phillips. The registers of Llanfrynach from
510,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,1695-1756 are now lost. Lucy Greenleafe and her sister Catharine are
511,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,quite obscure. One of them may have been the niece who was living with
512,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,Thomas Vaughan when news came from the country in 1658 of his father's
513,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"death (MS. Sloane, 1741, f. 89 (b)). Of the second family, Henry became"
514,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"Rector of Penderin in 1684, and vacated the living, probably through"
515,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"death, in 1713. A tablet to his memory hung during the present century"
516,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"in the church at Penderin, but when the church was restored the tablets"
517,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"were taken down and buried under the tiles of the chancel. His wife, a"
518,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"Walbeoffe of Talyllyn, belonged to the same family as the Walbeoffes of"
519,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"Llanhamlach (vol. ii., p. 189, _note_). The eldest girl, Grisill,"
520,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,married Roger Prosser. The Prossers were the younger branch of a
521,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,Brecknockshire family who had become sadlers and mercers in Brecon. Many
522,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"of their tombs are in the Priory church, but Theophilus Jones states"
523,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,that by his time they were extinct. Grisill Prosser was married a second
524,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"time, in 1709, to Morgan Watkins, an attorney, and was buried on August"
525,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"21, 1737. The second girl, Lucy, married Jenkin Jones of Trebinshwn, a"
526,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"cousin of Colonel Jenkin Jones, the local Parliamentary leader. Her"
527,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"daughter, Denise Jones, died single in 1780, as Theophilus Jones states,"
528,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,and her tombstone in the Priory church records her descent. The third
529,PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON.,"girl, Rachel, married John Turberville, one of the Turbervilles of"

727,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"that Vaughan was one of the garrison of Beeston Castle, which is"
728,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"described to me as ""a sort of grand stand for the battle-field."" Beeston"
729,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,Castle was invested by the Parliamentarians in the course of September
730,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,1645. On the approach of Charles the troops were drawn off on 19th
731,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,September to Chester.[14] Charles no doubt took the opportunity to
732,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,strengthen the garrison. After Rowton Heath Beeston Castle was again
733,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"besieged, and on November 16th it surrendered. The garrison were allowed"
734,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,to march across the Dee to Denbigh. I think that this winter ride from
735,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,the fallen fortress is the one described by Vaughan in the poem to Mr.
736,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,Ridsley. It is the more probable that Vaughan took part in this campaign
737,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"of 1645, in that Charles's force was largely recruited from Wales. After"
738,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"the battle of Naseby on June 14th, the King had marched through Wales,"
739,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,collecting such levies as he could. He was in Brecon on August 5th.[15]
740,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"It is quite possible that Vaughan, whose kinsman Sir William Vaughan was"
741,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"in command of a brigade, volunteered on this occasion. From Brecon"
742,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"Charles marched through Radnorshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire,"
743,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, and so to Oxford. In September"

747,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,It is just conceivable that it is to some occasion in this campaign that
748,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"Vaughan refers when he calls Dr. Powell his ""fellow-prisoner"" (vol. ii.,"
749,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,p. 178). The poet may even have been the Captain Vaughan whose name
750,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,appears in the official list of prisoners taken at Rowton Heath.[16]
751,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"Powell's name is not there, but then the list does not profess to be"
752,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,complete. But on the whole I think that Vaughan and Powell were only
753,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"fellow-prisoners in the Platonic sense of imprisonment in the flesh, and"
754,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"even if a literal imprisonment is intended, it may have been due to some"
755,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,act of persecution which Vaughan had to suffer as a Royalist at a later
756,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,date. There is in _The Mount of Olives_ (1652) a _Prayer in Adversity

927,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,between Oxford and London (p. 167). Between 1640 and 1644 he visited

958,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"a series of alchemical and, in reality, Luciferian writings. In 1650"
959,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"appeared the _Anthroposophia Theomagica_ and the _Magia Adamica_, in"

963,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"demons, Leviathan, Cerberus, and Belphegor (p. 214). In 1655 he"
964,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"published his _Euphrates_, and in 1656 made his head-quarters at"
965,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,Amsterdam or Eirenaeopolis. In 1659 came his _Fraternity of R. C._; in
966,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,1664 his _Medulla Alchymiae_.[30] In 1666 he exhibited the philosopher's
967,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,stone to Helvetius at La Haye and converted him to occultism: in 1667 he
968,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"at last resolved to publish his Opus Magnum, the _Introitus Apertus_,"
969,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,already written in 1645 (p. 215). In 1668 this was followed by the

986,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,I fear that I have taken Miss Vaughan with undue seriousness. Her
987,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,account of Thomas Vaughan is not only unsupported by direct

989,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"justified in accepting, even were direct evidence forthcoming. And it is"
990,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,all discordant with the little that we do happen to know of Thomas
991,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"Vaughan from other sources. The whole thing is, in fact, a pretty"
992,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,obvious romance of very modern fabrication. It appears to have been
993,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,compiled from such information as to the alchemical and mystical writers
994,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,of the seventeenth century as was within the reach of Albert Pike and
995,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,the brothers Vaughan about the year 1870.[35] It is always better to
996,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,explain than to refute an error; and the nature of the Luciferian
997,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,tradition of Thomas Vaughan is pretty clearly shown by the fact that it
998,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,is not corroborated in a single particular by any of the new facts about
999,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,him that have come to light since this probable date of its
1000,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,composition.[36] The fabricator put Thomas Vaughan's birth-place in
1001,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"Monmouth instead of Brecon, because he had never seen Dr. Grosart's"
1002,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,_Fuller Worthies_ Edition of Henry Vaughan. He makes no mention of any
1003,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"of the facts contained in Sloane MS. 1741, because that MS. was still"
1004,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"unknown. And, most fatal of all, he puts Thomas Vaughan's birth in 1612"
1005,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"instead of 1621-2, because Foster's _Alumni Oxonienses_ being yet"
1006,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"unpublished, he was ignorant of the record of that date preserved in the"
1007,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"University Registers. But we can go a step further. We can confute him,"

1009,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,those he did. It has already been shown that the ascription to Vaughan
1010,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,of the English translation of Maier's _Themis Aurea_ is due to a
1011,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,misunderstanding of a phrase used by Anthony à Wood. The _Athenae
1012,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,Oxonienses_ then was one source of the compilation. Another was the
1013,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"_Histoire de la Philosophie Hermétique_, written by Lenglet-Dufresnoy in"
1014,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,1742. Here is the proof. Miss Vaughan supports her statement as to the
1015,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"birth-date in 1612 by a quotation from the _Introitus Apertus_, in which"
1016,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"the writer states it to have been composed ""en l'an 1645 de notre salut,"
1017,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"et le trente-troisième de mon age."" This she professes to translate from"
1018,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,the _editio princeps_ published by Jean Lange in 1667. As a matter of
1019,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,fact it is taken from the version given in Lenglet-Dufresnoy's book. And
1020,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"Lenglet-Dufresnoy followed, not the edition of 1667, but the later"
1021,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,edition published by J. M. Faust at Frankfort in 1706. In this the words
1022,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"are ""trigesimo tertio,"" whereas in the _editio princeps_ they are"
1023,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"""vicesimo tertio,"" and in W. Cooper's English translation of 1669, ""in"
1024,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"the 23rd year of my age,"" thus bringing the date of the birth of"
1025,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"Eirenaeus Philalethes not to 1612, but to 1622. The ""legend of"
1026,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"Philalethes"" need detain us no longer. Miss Vaughan's narrative is a"
1027,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,very insufficient basis for regarding the pious minister and mystic
1028,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,which Thomas Vaughan appears to have been as a secret enemy of
1029,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,Christianity and a worshipper of Lucifer.
1030,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,
1031,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"But when the legend is set aside, there still remain certain questions"
1032,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,suggested by it which may be considered without much reference to the
1033,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,statements of Miss Vaughan. Was Thomas Vaughan a Rosicrucian? And was
1034,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"he, admittedly the author of a series of tracts under the name of"
1035,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"Eugenius Philalethes, also the author of those which bear the name of"
1036,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"Eirenaeus Philalethes? The first question is, I am afraid, insoluble,"
1037,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,until it has been decided whether the Fraternity of R. C. ever had an
1038,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,actual existence. Anthony à Wood states that Thomas Vaughan was a
1039,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"zealous Rosicrucian, but probably Anthony à Wood took the term in the"
1040,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,general sense of mystic and alchemist. On the other hand Vaughan
1041,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"himself, in his preface to the English translation of the Rosicrucian"
1042,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"manifestoes, seems to disavow any personal acquaintance with the members"
1043,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"of the fraternity. Even this is not conclusive, for the Rosicrucian"
1044,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"rule, as given in the _Laws of the Brotherhood_, published by Sincerus"

1046,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,
1047,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"There is more material for the discussion of the second question, but I"
1048,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,do not know that it is more possible to come to a definite conclusion.

1073,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,Starkey gives the age of Eirenaeus Philalethes as 33 in 1654. This
1074,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,precisely confirms the writer's own statement in the earlier editions of
1075,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"the _Introitus Apertus_ that he was 23 in 1645, and fixes the birth-date"
1076,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,as 1621 or 1622. Now this agrees remarkably with the birth-date
1077,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,ascertained from other sources of Thomas Vaughan. But Thomas died in
1078,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"1666, and it is usually asserted that Eirenaeus Philalethes lived until"
1079,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,at least 1678. Miss Vaughan states that he must have been alive in that
1080,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"year, because he then published the _Ripley Revived_, and the _Enarratio"
1081,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,Trium Gebri Medicinarum_. She declares that the author of the
1082,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,_Enarratio_ mentions the pains taken about that edition (p. 240). I do
1083,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,not find any prefatory matter in this book at all. There is a preface to
1084,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"the _Ripley Revived_, but this was written long before 1678, for it"
1085,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"mentions the _Introitus Apertus_, published in 1667, as still in"

1090,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"outlived Thomas Vaughan, for there is no proof that the adept who showed"
1091,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"the philosopher's stone to Helvetius on December 27th, 1666,[40] was the"

1125,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,cannot be shown to have been anyone else. But I am not satisfied. We do
1126,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"not know that Thomas Vaughan was ever in America, and there is the"
1127,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"strong evidence of Anthony à Wood, who distinguishes between Eirenaeus"
1128,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"and Eugenius, and who appears to have had information from Henry Vaughan"
1129,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,himself. Mr. A. E. Waite argues against the identification on the ground
1130,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"that Eirenaeus Philalethes was a ""physical alchemist,"" whereas Thomas"
1131,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,Vaughan's alchemy was spiritual and mystical. But we have Vaughan's
1132,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,authority for saying that he had pursued the physical alchemy also.[41]
1133,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,And he was clearly doing so when he wrote Sloane MS. 1741. A more
1134,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,pertinent objection is perhaps that Eirenaeus Philalethes appears to
1135,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,have been in possession of the grand secret when he wrote the _Introitus
1136,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,"Apertus_ in 1645, whereas Thomas Vaughan was still seeking it in 1658."
1137,1626.    E. G.    T. V.    W. T.,To pursue the matter further would require a wide knowledge of the

1259,FOOTNOTES:,[23] An entire literature has grown up in Paris during the last year
1260,FOOTNOTES:,around the question whether the cultus of Lucifer is practised in
1261,FOOTNOTES:,certain Masonic Lodges. A number of Catholic journalists and
1262,FOOTNOTES:,"pamphleteers assert very categorically that this is the case, that the"
1263,FOOTNOTES:,"centre of this cultus, containing the full Luciferian initiates, is the"
1264,FOOTNOTES:,"33^rd^ degree of a so-called New and Reformed Palladian Rite, having its"
1265,FOOTNOTES:,"head-quarters at Charlestown, and that the chiefs of this Rite have"
1266,FOOTNOTES:,obtained a controlling influence over the whole of Freemasonry. The
1267,FOOTNOTES:,"creed is described as Manichaean in character, with Lucifer as Dieu-Bon"
1268,FOOTNOTES:,"and Adonai, the God of the Catholics, as Dieu-Mauvais. Adonai is the"
1269,FOOTNOTES:,"principle of asceticism, Lucifer of natural humanity and _la joie de"
1270,FOOTNOTES:,vivre_. The rituals and the accepted interpretation of the Masonic
1271,FOOTNOTES:,"symbolism used in the lodges, or ""triangles,"" are of a phallic type."
1272,FOOTNOTES:,"Women are admitted to membership. Immorality, a parody of the Eucharist,"
1273,FOOTNOTES:,"known as the black mass, and the practice of black magic, take place at"
1274,FOOTNOTES:,"the meetings. Lucifer is worshipped in the form of Baphomet, but from"
1275,FOOTNOTES:,"time to time he is personally evoked, and manifested to his followers."
1276,FOOTNOTES:,"Luciferianism tends to become identical with Satanism, in which Lucifer"
1277,FOOTNOTES:,and Satan are identified and frankly worshipped as evil. The first
1278,FOOTNOTES:,mention of Luciferian Freemasonry was in the _Y-a-t-il des Femmes dans
1279,FOOTNOTES:,"la Franc Maçonnerie?_ (1891), of the somewhat notorious Leo Taxil. But"
1280,FOOTNOTES:,the case rests mainly on the alleged revelations of writers who claim to
1281,FOOTNOTES:,have themselves been members of the Palladian Rite. The chief of these
1282,FOOTNOTES:,"are Dr. Hacke or Bataille, Signor Margiotta and Miss Diana Vaughan."
1283,FOOTNOTES:,Unfortunately very little evidence is forthcoming as to the identity of
1284,FOOTNOTES:,"any of these personages. Many leading Masons, _e.g._, M. Papus in his"
1285,FOOTNOTES:,"_Le Diable et l'Occultisme_, deny that Luciferian Freemasonry exists at"
1286,FOOTNOTES:,"all, and it is freely stated (_cf._ _Light_ for 27 June and 4 July,"
1287,FOOTNOTES:,"1896, pp. 305, 322) that Miss Diana Vaughan is a myth, and that her"
1288,FOOTNOTES:,_Mémoires_ with the rest of the revelations are the ingenious concoction
1289,FOOTNOTES:,of a band of irresponsible journalists of whom Leo Taxil is the chief.
1290,FOOTNOTES:,"No one appears to have seen Miss Vaughan, and she is alleged to be"
1291,FOOTNOTES:,hiding in some convent from the vengeance of the Luciferians. Probably
1292,FOOTNOTES:,there will be some further light thrown on the matter before long: in
1293,FOOTNOTES:,the meantime a good summary of the evidence up-to-date may be found in
1294,FOOTNOTES:,A. E. Waite's _Devil-Worship in France_ (1896). Assuming that
1295,FOOTNOTES:,"Luciferianism really exists, I do not for a moment believe that it has"
1296,FOOTNOTES:,the antiquity which Miss Vaughan claims for it. The various Rites of
1297,FOOTNOTES:,"modern Freemasonry, with their fantastic and high-sounding degrees, are"
1298,FOOTNOTES:,comparatively recent excrescences upon the original Craft Masonry. The
1299,FOOTNOTES:,New and Reformed Palladian Rite is said to have been founded at
1300,FOOTNOTES:,"Charlestown by the well-known Mason, Albert Pike, in 1870. It is based"
1301,FOOTNOTES:,"on the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, which dates from the"
1302,FOOTNOTES:,"beginning of the century. If there is such a thing as Luciferianism, I"
1303,FOOTNOTES:,do not think we need look further back than 1870 for its origin. As
1304,FOOTNOTES:,"expounded by Miss Vaughan and others, it is pretty clearly a compilation"
1305,FOOTNOTES:,"from Eliphaz Levi and other occultist and Cabbalistic writers, with a"
1306,FOOTNOTES:,"good deal of modern American Spiritualism thrown in. Albert Pike, a man"
1307,FOOTNOTES:,"of considerable learning, could easily have invented it. Masonic"
1308,FOOTNOTES:,symbolism lends itself readily enough to a wide range of
1309,FOOTNOTES:,interpretations. I do not say that seventeenth-century occultism has
1310,FOOTNOTES:,left no traces upon Freemasonry which modern ritual-mongers may have
1311,FOOTNOTES:,elaborated; but it is a far cry from this to the belief that Thomas

1328,FOOTNOTES:,"though she does not mention it, _Eugenius Philalethes_ (p. 211). She"

1398,FOOTNOTES:,
1399,FOOTNOTES:,[36] I have already pointed out that Miss Vaughan is quite possibly a

1414,FOOTNOTES:,of Eirenaeus Philoponos Philalethes (George Starkey?) are often
1415,FOOTNOTES:,"attributed to him in error. The B. M. Catalogue, s.vv. _Philaletha,"
1416,FOOTNOTES:,"Philalethes_, is a mass of confusions. Lenglet-Dufresnoy, _Histoire de"
1417,FOOTNOTES:,"la Philosophie Hermétique_ (iii. 261-266), gives a long list of printed"
1418,FOOTNOTES:,and manuscript works. Most of these he had probably never seen. He
1419,FOOTNOTES:,probably took many items in his list from one in J. M. Faust's edition
1420,FOOTNOTES:,"of the _Introitus Apertus_ (Frankfort, 1706); and this, in its turn, was"
1421,FOOTNOTES:,based on what Eirenaeus Philalethes himself says he has written in the
1422,FOOTNOTES:,"preface to _Ripley Revived_. He there says, after naming other works:"

2662,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"And now pass'd o'er the Alps, that mighty bar"
2663,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"'Twixt France and Rome, fear of the future war"

2666,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,All is undone as yet--saith he--unless
2667,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Our Pænish forces we advance, and press"
2668,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Upon Rome's self; break down her gates and wall,"
2669,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,And plant our colours in Suburra's vale.
2670,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,O the rare sight! if this great soldier we
2671,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Arm'd on his Getick elephant might see!
2672,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"But what's the event? O glory, how the itch"
2673,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Of thy short wonders doth mankind bewitch!
2674,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,He that but now all Italy and Spain
2675,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Had conquer'd o'er, is beaten out again;"
2676,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"And in the heart of Afric, and the sight"
2677,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Of his own Carthage, forc'd to open flight."
2678,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Banish'd from thence, a fugitive he posts"
2679,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"To Syria first, then to Bithynia's coasts,"
2680,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Both places by his sword secur'd, though he"
2681,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,In this distress must not acknowledg'd be;
2682,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Where once a general he triumphed, now"
2683,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"To show what Fortune can, he begs as low."
2684,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,And thus that soul which through all nations hurl'd
2685,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Conquest and war, and did amaze the world,"
2686,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Of all those glories robb'd, at his last breath,"
2687,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Fortune would not vouchsafe a soldier's death.
2688,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"For all that blood the field of Cannæ boasts,"

2690,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,No other end--freed from the pile and sword--
2691,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Than a poor ring would Fortune him afford.
2692,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Go now, ambitious man! new plots design,"

2694,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"That, after all, at best thou may'st but be"
2695,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,A pleasing story to posterity!
2696,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"The Macedon one world could not contain,"
2697,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"We hear him of the narrow earth complain,"
2698,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"And sweat for room, as if Seriphus Isle"

2704,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,It is believed--if what Greece writes be true--
2705,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,That Xerxes with his Persian fleet did hew
2706,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Their ways through mountains, that their sails full blown"

2708,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"The spacious continent, and by plain force"
2709,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Betwixt the mount and it, made a divorce;"
2710,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"That seas exhausted were, and made firm land,"
2711,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,And Sestos joined unto Abydos strand;
2712,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,That on their march his Medes but passing by
2713,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Drank thee, Scamander, and Melenus dry;"
2714,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,With whatsoe'er incredible design
2715,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Sostratus sings, inspir'd with pregnant wine."
2716,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,But what's the end? He that the other day
2717,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Divided Hellespont, and forc'd his way"
2718,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Through all her angry billows, that assign'd"
2719,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"New punishments unto the waves, and wind,"
2720,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,No sooner saw the Salaminian seas
2721,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"But he was driven out by Themistocles,"
2722,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"And of that fleet--supposed to be so great,"
2723,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,That all mankind shar'd in the sad defeat--
2724,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Not one sail sav'd, in a poor fisher's boat,"
2725,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Chas'd o'er the working surge, was glad to float,"
2726,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Cutting his desp'rate course through the tir'd flood,"
2727,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"And fought again with carcases, and blood."
2728,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,O foolish mad Ambition! these are still
2729,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,The famous dangers that attend thy will.
2730,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Give store of days, good Jove, give length of years,"
2731,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Are the next vows; these with religious fears
2732,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,And constancy we pay; but what's so bad
2733,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"As a long, sinful age? what cross more sad"
2734,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Than misery of years? how great an ill
2735,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Is that which doth but nurse more sorrow still?
2736,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"It blacks the face, corrupt and dulls the blood,"
2737,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Benights the quickest eye, distastes the food,"
2738,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,And such deep furrows cuts i' th' checker'd skin
2739,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,As in th' old oaks of Tabraca are seen.
2740,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Youth varies in most things; strength, beauty, wit,"
2741,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Are several graces; but where age doth hit
2742,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"It makes no difference; the same weak voice,"
2743,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,And trembling ague in each member lies:
2744,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"A general hateful baldness, with a curs'd"
2745,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Perpetual pettishness; and, which is worst,"
2746,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"A foul, strong flux of humours, and more pain"
2747,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"To feed, than if he were to nurse again;"
2748,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"So tedious to himself, his wife, and friends,"
2749,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"That his own sons, and servants, wish his end."
2750,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,His taste and feeling dies; and of that fire
2751,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"The am'rous lover burns in, no desire:"
2752,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Or if there were, what pleasure could it be,"
2753,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Where lust doth reign without ability?
2754,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Nor is this all: what matters it, where he"
2755,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Sits in the spacious stage? who can nor see,"
2756,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Nor hear what's acted, whom the stiller voice"
2757,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Of spirited, wanton airs, or the loud noise"
2758,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Of trumpets cannot pierce; whom thunder can
2759,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"But scarce inform who enters, or what man"
2760,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"He personates, what 'tis they act, or say?"
2761,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,How many scenes are done? what time of day?
2762,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Besides that little blood his carcase holds
2763,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Hath lost[53] its native warmth, and fraught with colds"
2764,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Catarrhs, and rheums, to thick black jelly turns,"
2765,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,And never but in fits and fevers burns.
2766,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Such vast infirmities, so huge a stock"
2767,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Of sickness and diseases to him flock,"
2768,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"That Hyppia ne'er so many lovers knew,"
2769,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Nor wanton Maura; physic never slew
2770,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"So many patients, nor rich lawyers spoil"
2771,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,More wards and widows; it were lesser toil
2772,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,To number out what manors and domains
2773,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Licinius' razor purchas'd: one complains
2774,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Of weakness in the back, another pants"
2775,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"For lack of breath, the third his eyesight wants;"
2776,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Nay, some so feeble are, and full of pain,"
2777,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,That infant-like they must be fed again.
2778,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"These faint too at their meals; their wine they spill,"
2779,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"And like young birds, that wait the mother's bill,"
2780,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,They gape for meat; but sadder far than this
2781,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Their senseless ignorance and dotage is;
2782,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"For neither they, their friends, nor servants know,"
2783,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Nay, those themselves begot, and bred up too,"
2784,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,No longer now they'll own; for madly they
2785,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Proscribe them all, and what, on the last day,"
2786,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,The misers cannot carry to the grave
2787,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"For their past sins, their prostitutes must have."
2788,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,But grant age lack'd these plagues: yet must they see
2789,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"As great, as many: frail mortality,"
2790,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"In such a length of years, hath many falls,"
2791,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,And deads a life with frequent funerals.
2792,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,The nimblest hour in all the span can steal
2793,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"A friend, or brother from's; there's no repeal"
2794,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"In death, or time; this day a wife we mourn,"
2795,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,To-morrow's tears a son; and the next urn
2796,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,A sister fills. Long-livers have assign'd
2797,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"These curses still, that with a restless mind,"
2798,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"An age of fresh renewing cares they buy,"
2799,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,And in a tide of tears grow old and die.
2800,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Nestor,--if we great Homer may believe--"
2801,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,In his full strength three hundred years did live:
2802,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Happy--thou'lt say--that for so long a time
2803,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Enjoy'd free nature, with the grape and wine"

2808,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Of all he meets, he asks what is the cause"
2809,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,He liv'd thus long; for what breach of their laws
2810,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,The gods thus punish'd him? what sin had he
2811,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Done worthy of a long life's misery.
2812,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Thus Peleus his Achilles mourned, and he"

2814,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Had Priam died before Phereclus' fleet
2815,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Was built, or Paris stole the fatal Greek,"
2816,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Troy had yet stood, and he perhaps had gone"
2817,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,In peace unto the lower shades; his son
2818,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Sav'd with his plenteous offspring, and the rest"
2819,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,In solemn pomp bearing his fun'ral chest.
2820,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"But long life hinder'd this: unhappy he,"
2821,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"Kept for a public ruin, liv'd to see"
2822,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"All Asia lost, and ere he could aspire,"
2823,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,In his own house saw both the sword and fire;
2824,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"All white with age and cares, his feeble arm"
2825,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Had now forgot the war; but this alarm
2826,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,Gathers his dying spirits; and as we
2827,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,An aged ox worn out with labour see
2828,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"By his ungrateful master, after all"
2829,JUVENAL'S TENTH SATIRE TRANSLATED.,"His years of toil, a thankless victim fall:"

8135,THE WORLD.,"In fine conceits, like streams in a sharp frost;"
8136,THE WORLD.,"I will not strive, nor the rule break,"

8143,THE WORLD.,Thou art not Truth! for he that tries

8157,THE WORLD.,"And so severely sweep away,"
8158,THE WORLD.,That few remember where it lay.

8192,THE WORLD.,"I note their coarse and proud approaches,"
8193,THE WORLD.,"Their silks, perfumes, and glittering coaches."
8194,THE WORLD.,But in the narrow way to Thee
8195,THE WORLD.,"I observe only poverty,"
8196,THE WORLD.,And despis'd things; and all along
8197,THE WORLD.,"The ragged, mean, and humble throng"

8247,THE BEE.,"With a chaste kiss the cool dew greets,"
8248,THE BEE.,"When the toils of the day are done,"

8250,THE BEE.,Here flying winds and flowing wells
8251,THE BEE.,"Are the wise, watchful hermit's bells;"
8252,THE BEE.,Their busy murmurs all the night
8253,THE BEE.,"To praise or prayer do invite,"
8254,THE BEE.,"And with an awful sound arrest,"
8255,THE BEE.,And piously employ his breast.
8256,THE BEE.,
8257,THE BEE.,"When in the East the dawn doth blush,"
8258,THE BEE.,"Here cool, fresh spirits the air brush;"
8259,THE BEE.,"Herbs straight get up, flow'rs peep and spread,"
8260,THE BEE.,"Trees whisper praise, and bow the head:"
8261,THE BEE.,"Birds, from the shades of night releas'd,"

8264,THE BEE.,The glory of the morning's King.
8265,THE BEE.,"The hermit hears, and with meek voice"
8266,THE BEE.,"Offers his own up, and their joys:"

8269,THE BEE.,
8270,THE BEE.,"If sudden storms the day invade,"
8271,THE BEE.,They flock about him to the shade:
8272,THE BEE.,"Where wisely they expect the end,"
8273,THE BEE.,Giving the tempest time to spend;
8274,THE BEE.,And hard by shelters on some bough
8275,THE BEE.,"Hilarion's servant, the sage crow."
8276,THE BEE.,
8277,THE BEE.,O purer years of light and grace!
8278,THE BEE.,The diff'rence is great as the space
8279,THE BEE.,"'Twixt you and us, who blindly run"

8281,THE BEE.,Is not fair Nature of herself
8282,THE BEE.,Much richer than dull paint or pelf?
8283,THE BEE.,And are not streams at the spring-head

8300,THE BEE.,In truth and spirit to serve Thee!
8301,THE BEE.,Where undisturb'd I may converse
8302,THE BEE.,With Thy great Self; and there rehearse

8311,THE BEE.,
8312,THE BEE.,Suffer me not in any want

10159,G. G.,
10160,G. G.,The writer referred to is John Ogier de Gombauld (1567-1666). His prose
10161,G. G.,tale of _Endymion_ was translated by Richard Hurst in 1637. _Ismena_ and

10168,G. G.,"differences at Routon Heath, near Chester."
10169,G. G.,
10170,G. G.,"The battle of Routon, or Rowton, Heath took place on September 24, 1645."
10171,G. G.,"The Royalist forces, under Charles I. and Sir Marmaduke Langdale,"
10172,G. G.,"advancing to raise the siege of Chester, were met and routed by the"
10173,G. G.,Parliamentarians under Poyntz. The contemporary pamphlets give a long
10174,G. G.,"list of the prisoners taken at Routon Heath, but name hardly any of"
10175,G. G.,"those slain. It is therefore difficult to say who R. W., evidently a"
10176,G. G.,"dear friend of Vaughan's, may have been. He appears to have been missing"
10177,G. G.,for a year before he was finally given up. From lines 25-27 we learn
10178,G. G.,that he was a young man of only twenty. The most likely suggestion for
10179,G. G.,"his identification seems to me that of Mr. C. H. Firth, who points out"
10180,G. G.,to me that the name of one Roger Wood occurs in the list of Catholics
10181,G. G.,who fell in the King's service as having been slain at Chester. Miss
10182,G. G.,"Southall (_Songs of Siluria_, 1890, p. 124) suggests that he may have"
10183,G. G.,"been either Richard Williams, a nephew of Sir Henry Williams, of"
10184,G. G.,"Gwernyfed, who died unmarried, or else a son of Richard Winter, of"
10185,G. G.,"Llangoed. He might also, I think, have been one of Vaughan's wife's"
10186,G. G.,"family, the Wises, and possibly also a Walbeoffe. A reference to the"
10187,G. G.,Walbeoffe pedigree in the note to p. 189 will show that there was a
10188,G. G.,"Robert Walbeoffe, brother of C. W. Miss Morgan thinks that he is a"
10189,G. G.,"generation too old, and that the unnamed son of C. W., who, according to"
10190,G. G.,"his tombstone, did not survive him, may have been a Robert, and the R."

10206,G. G.,"included Bishton."" I think that Biston is clearly Beeston Castle, one of"
10207,G. G.,"the outlying defences of Chester, which played a considerable part in"
10208,G. G.,"the siege. It surrendered on November 5, 1645, and the small garrison"
