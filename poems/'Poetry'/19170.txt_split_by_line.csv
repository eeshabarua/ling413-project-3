38,PREFACE,"_Primavera: Poems, by Four Authors. Oxford:"
39,PREFACE,"Published by B. H. Blackwell, Broad Street."
40,PREFACE,"MDCCCXC._ (Fcap 8vo, pp. 43.)"
41,PREFACE,
42,PREFACE,Such is the title of a little 'book of verses' that at the time
43,PREFACE,"found favour in the eyes of a few discerning critics, and then,"
44,PREFACE,"apparently, was forgotten. As originally issued its dark brown"
45,PREFACE,paper wrapper was adorned with a simple but effective woodcut
46,PREFACE,"design by Mr. Selwyn Image, which we have reproduced on our first"
47,PREFACE,half-title. Even more fortunate has been the discovery of a
48,PREFACE,"signed review in the pages of the _Academy_ for August 9, 1890,"
49,PREFACE,by the late John Addington Symonds. As a preface nothing could be
50,PREFACE,better. And in this connexion the lines which we prefix from
51,PREFACE,Guarini are also singularly appropriate. For these songs of Youth
52,PREFACE,are still worth while; they thrill and fill us as of yesterday
53,PREFACE,"with their haunting sense of vanished love, of"
54,PREFACE,
55,PREFACE,"'Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips"
56,PREFACE,Bidding adieu.'

64,PREFACE,
65,PREFACE,
66,PREFACE,"This little book was written by four friends, three of them"
67,PREFACE,"under-graduates at Oxford, and all of them penetrated with the"
68,PREFACE,"spirit of the higher culture of our time. The poems, it is clear,"
69,PREFACE,"have been carefully selected; and, it is probable, have been"
70,PREFACE,diligently polished. There is not one which is not remarkable for
71,PREFACE,delicacy of style and conscious aiming after excellence in art.
72,PREFACE,Whether these qualities promise well for future achievement and
73,PREFACE,development is a question open to debate. But there can be no
74,PREFACE,doubt that in _Primavera_ we possess another of those tiny
75,PREFACE,"verse-books like _Ionica_, or Mr. Percy Pinkerton's _Galeazzo_,"
76,PREFACE,which will not lose in freshness and in perfume as the years go
77,PREFACE,by.
78,PREFACE,
79,PREFACE,The poems have the distinction of making one wish to be
80,PREFACE,acquainted with their authors. Though they differ a good deal in
81,PREFACE,"mental tone, perhaps also somewhat in literary merit, they"
82,PREFACE,"possess marked common characteristics: a restrained refinement, a"
83,PREFACE,"subdued reserve, a gentle melancholy; the note of the latest"
84,PREFACE,"Anglican æsthetic school. We find no humour, no _Sturm und"
85,PREFACE,"Drang_, no inequalities and incoherences of passion. Even where"
86,PREFACE,"it is obvious that the emotion has been intense, possibly of a"
87,PREFACE,"rare and peculiar strain, as in Mr. Binyon's ""Testamentum Amoris"""
88,PREFACE,"and Mr. Phillips's ""To a Lost Love,"" the expression of it obeys"
89,PREFACE,"no violence of impulse. A tender tone of regret, rather than of"
90,PREFACE,"acute grief, steeps these stanzas (to quote one instance)"
91,PREFACE,addressed to a friend removed into the spiritual world by death.
92,PREFACE,
93,PREFACE,"""Oh, thou art cold! In that high sphere"
94,PREFACE,"Thou art a thing apart,"
95,PREFACE,Losing in saner happiness
96,PREFACE,This madness of the heart.
97,PREFACE,
98,PREFACE,"""And yet, at times, thou still shalt feel"
99,PREFACE,"A passing breath, a pain;"
100,PREFACE,"Disturb'd, as though a door in heaven"
101,PREFACE,Had oped and closed again.
102,PREFACE,
103,PREFACE,"""And thou shalt shiver, while the hymns,"
104,PREFACE,"The solemn hymns, shall cease;"
105,PREFACE,A moment half remember me;
106,PREFACE,"Then turn away to peace."""
107,PREFACE,
108,PREFACE,It would be invidious to institute critical comparisons between
109,PREFACE,the styles of these four friends and their respective merits. It
110,PREFACE,"may, however, be remarked that Mr. Manmohan Ghose's work possesses"
111,PREFACE,a peculiar interest on account of its really notable command of
112,PREFACE,"the subtleties of English prosody and diction, combined with just"
113,PREFACE,a touch of foreign feeling. The artful employment of imperfect
114,PREFACE,"rhymes in ""Raymond and Ida"" illustrates what I mean. Occasionally,"
115,PREFACE,"too, Mr. Ghose produces exactly the right phrase by means of a"
116,PREFACE,felicitous simplicity. Notice the line which I have italicised in
117,PREFACE,the following stanza:
118,PREFACE,
119,PREFACE,"""In the deep West the heavens grow heavenlier,"
120,PREFACE,Eve after eve; and still
121,PREFACE,_The glorious stars remember to appear;_
122,PREFACE,The roses on the hill
123,PREFACE,Are fragrant as before;
124,PREFACE,"Only thy face, of all that's dear,"
125,PREFACE,"I shall see nevermore!"""
126,PREFACE,
127,PREFACE,"Take, again, these two lines:"
128,PREFACE,
129,PREFACE,"""Forget the shining of the stars, forget"
130,PREFACE,"The vernal visitation of the rose."""
131,PREFACE,
132,PREFACE,There is but one piece of blank verse in the book. This prologue
133,PREFACE,"to ""Orestes,"" by Mr. Stephen Phillips, has strength, is firm in"
134,PREFACE,"outline, somewhat tardy in movement, fit for sonorous declamation."
135,PREFACE,The gravity which I have indicated as a ruling quality of all
136,PREFACE,these youthful compositions makes itself felt here in its proper
137,PREFACE,"place. We might have wished, perhaps, for more of joyous accent in"
138,PREFACE,"the ode to ""Youth,"" by Mr. Laurence Binyon, which dwells less on"
139,PREFACE,the rapture of youth than on its sadness--the melancholy of
140,PREFACE,Theognis over youth's decay:
141,PREFACE,
142,PREFACE,"""O bright new-comer, filled with thoughts of joy,"
143,PREFACE,"Joy to be thine amid these pleasant plains,"
144,PREFACE,"Know'st thou not, child, what surely coming pains"
145,PREFACE,"Await thee, for that eager heart's annoy?"
146,PREFACE,"Misunderstanding, disappointment, tears,"
147,PREFACE,"Wronged love, spoiled hope, mistrust and ageing fears,"
148,PREFACE,"Eternal longing for one perfect friend,"
149,PREFACE,"And unavailing wishes without end?"""
150,PREFACE,
151,PREFACE,Mr. Cripps alone permits his Muse a gravely jocund note in his
152,PREFACE,"""Seasons' Comfort."" He, too, of the four fellow-versifiers shows"
153,PREFACE,"the greater aptitude for experiments, though it may perhaps be"
154,PREFACE,"felt that his touch is nowhere quite so sure, nor his artistic"
155,PREFACE,feeling so direct as theirs.
156,PREFACE,
157,PREFACE,It is difficult to lay the critic's hand lightly enough upon
158,PREFACE,"poems like these, or to make it clear what particular attraction"
159,PREFACE,"they possess. With all the charm of rathe spring-flowers, they"
160,PREFACE,suggest the possibilities of varied personality not yet
161,PREFACE,accentuated in the authors. Let us hope that the four Muses of
162,PREFACE,"the four friends will not, like the primroses,"
163,PREFACE,
164,PREFACE,"""die unmarried ere they can behold"
165,PREFACE,"Bright Phoebus in his strength,"""
166,PREFACE,
167,PREFACE,"but that we shall profit by their summer-songs, while ever"
168,PREFACE,remaining grateful for their _Primavera_.

206,POEMS,"Lo! where she sits, breathing, yet all but dead."
207,POEMS,"She loved the heavens of old, she thought them fair;"
208,POEMS,And dream'd of Gods in Tempe's golden air.
209,POEMS,"For her the wind had voice, the sea its cry;"
210,POEMS,She deem'd heroic Greece could never die.
211,POEMS,"Breathless was she, to think what nymphs might play"
212,POEMS,"In clear green depths, deep-shaded from the day;"
213,POEMS,She thought the dim and inarticulate god
214,POEMS,"Was beautiful, nor knew she man a sod;"
215,POEMS,"But hoped what seem'd might not be all untrue,"
216,POEMS,And feared to look beyond the eternal blue.
217,POEMS,But now the heavens are bared of dreams divine.
218,POEMS,"Still murmurs she, like Autumn, _This was mine!_"
219,POEMS,"How should she face the ghastly, jarring Truth,"
220,POEMS,"That questions all, and tramples without ruth?"
221,POEMS,"And still she clings to Ida of her dreams,"
222,POEMS,"And sobs, _Ah! let the world be what it seems!_"
223,POEMS,Then the shy nymph shall softly come again;
224,POEMS,"The world, once more, make music for her pain."
225,POEMS,"For, sitting in the dim and ghostly night,"
226,POEMS,She fain would stay the strong approach of light;
227,POEMS,"While later bards cleave to her, and believe"
228,POEMS,That in her sorrow she can still conceive!
229,POEMS,"Oh, let her dream; still lovely is her sigh;"
230,POEMS,"Oh, rouse her not, or she shall surely die."

240,YOUTH,"When life begins anew,"
241,YOUTH,"And Youth, from gathering flowers,"
242,YOUTH,"From vague delights, rapt musings, twilight hours,"
243,YOUTH,"Turns restless, seeking some great deed to do,"
244,YOUTH,To sum his foster'd dreams; when that fresh birth
245,YOUTH,"Unveils the real, the throng'd and spacious Earth,"
246,YOUTH,"And he awakes to those more ample skies,"
247,YOUTH,By other aims and by new powers possess'd:
248,YOUTH,"How deeply, then, his breast"
249,YOUTH,Is fill'd with pangs of longing! how his eyes
250,YOUTH,Drink in the enchanted prospect! Fair it lies
251,YOUTH,"Before him, with its plains expanding vast,"
252,YOUTH,"Peopled with visions, and enrich'd with dreams;"
253,YOUTH,"Dim cities, ancient forests, winding streams,"
254,YOUTH,"Places resounding in the famous past,"
255,YOUTH,A kingdom ready to his hand!
256,YOUTH,How like a bride Life seems to stand
257,YOUTH,"In welcome, and with festal robes array'd!"
258,YOUTH,He feels her loveliness pervade
259,YOUTH,And pierce him with inexplicable sweetness;
260,YOUTH,"And, in her smiles delighting, and the fires"
261,YOUTH,"Of his own pulses, passionate soul!"
262,YOUTH,"Measures his strength by his desires,"
263,YOUTH,"And the wide future by their fleetness,"
264,YOUTH,As his thought leaps to the long-distant goal.
265,YOUTH,
266,YOUTH,So eagerly across that unknown span
267,YOUTH,"Of years he gazes: what, to him,"
268,YOUTH,"Are bounds and barriers, tales of Destiny,"
269,YOUTH,"Death, and the fabled impotence of man?"
270,YOUTH,"Already, in his marching dream,"
271,YOUTH,Men at his sun-like coming seem
272,YOUTH,"As with an inspiration stirr'd, and he"
273,YOUTH,"To kindle with new thoughts degenerate nations,"
274,YOUTH,In sordid cares immersed so long;
275,YOUTH,Thrill'd with ethereal exultations
276,YOUTH,"And a victorious expectancy,"
277,YOUTH,"Even such as swell'd the breasts of Bacchus' throng,"
278,YOUTH,When that triumphal burst of joy was hurl'd
279,YOUTH,Upon the wondering world;
280,YOUTH,"When from the storied, sacred East afar,"
281,YOUTH,"Down Indian gorges clothed in green,"
282,YOUTH,With flower-rein'd tigers and with ivory car
283,YOUTH,"He came, the youthful god;"
284,YOUTH,"Beautiful Bacchus, ivy-crown'd, his hair"
285,YOUTH,"Blown on the wind, and flush'd limbs bare,"
286,YOUTH,"And lips apart, and radiant eyes,"
287,YOUTH,"And ears that caught the coming melodies,"
288,YOUTH,As wave on wave of revellers swept abroad;
289,YOUTH,"Wreathed with vine-leaves, shouting, trampling onwards,"
290,YOUTH,With toss'd timbrel and loud tambourine.
291,YOUTH,
292,YOUTH,Alas! the disenchanting years have roll'd
293,YOUTH,On hearts and minds becoming cold:
294,YOUTH,Mirth is gone from us; and the world is old.
295,YOUTH,
296,YOUTH,"O bright new-comer, fill'd with thoughts of joy,"
297,YOUTH,"Joy to be thine amid these pleasant plains,"
298,YOUTH,"Know'st thou not, child, what surely coming pains"
299,YOUTH,"Await thee, for that eager heart's annoy?"
300,YOUTH,"Misunderstanding, disappointment, tears,"
301,YOUTH,"Wrong'd love, spoil'd hope, mistrust and ageing fears,"
302,YOUTH,"Eternal longing for one perfect friend,"
303,YOUTH,And unavailing wishes without end?
304,YOUTH,"Thou proud and pure of spirit, how must thou bear"
305,YOUTH,"To have thine infinite hates and loves confined,"
306,YOUTH,"School'd, and despised? How keep unquench'd and free"
307,YOUTH,'Mid others' commerce and economy
308,YOUTH,"Such ample visions, oft in alien air"
309,YOUTH,Tamed to the measure of the common kind?
310,YOUTH,"How hard for thee, swept on, for ever hurl'd"
311,YOUTH,"From hour to hour, bewilder'd and forlorn,"
312,YOUTH,"To move with clear eyes and with steps secure,"
313,YOUTH,"To keep the light within, to fitly scorn"
314,YOUTH,"Those all too possible and easy goals,"
315,YOUTH,Trivial ambitions of soon-sated souls!
316,YOUTH,"And, patient in thy purpose, to endure"
317,YOUTH,The pity and the wisdom of the world.
318,YOUTH,
319,YOUTH,"Vain, vain such warning to those happy ears!"
320,YOUTH,Disturb not their delight! By unkind powers
321,YOUTH,"Doom'd to keep pace with the relentless Hours,"
322,YOUTH,"He, too, ere long, shall feel Earth's glory change;"
323,YOUTH,"Familiar names shall take an accent strange,"
324,YOUTH,"A deeper meaning, a more human tone;"
325,YOUTH,"No more pass'd by, unheeded or unknown,"
326,YOUTH,The things that then shall be beheld through tears.
327,YOUTH,
328,YOUTH,"Yet, O just Nature, thou"
329,YOUTH,"Who, if men's hearts be hard, art always mild;"
330,YOUTH,"O fields and streams, and places undefiled,"
331,YOUTH,"Let your sweet airs be ever on his brow,"
332,YOUTH,Remember still your child.
333,YOUTH,"Thou too, O human world, if old desires,"
334,YOUTH,"If thoughts, not alien once, can move thee now,"
335,YOUTH,Teach him not yet that idly he aspires
336,YOUTH,"Where thou hast fail'd; not soon let it be plain,"
337,YOUTH,"That all who seek in thee for nobler fires,"
338,YOUTH,"For generous passion, spend their hopes in vain:"
339,YOUTH,"Lest that insidious Fate, foe of mankind,"
340,YOUTH,"Who ever waits upon our weakness, try"
341,YOUTH,"With whispers his unnerved and faltering mind,"
342,YOUTH,"Palsy his powers; for she has spells to dry,"
343,YOUTH,"Like the March blast, his blood, turn flesh to stone,"
344,YOUTH,"And, conjuring action with necessity,"
345,YOUTH,"Freeze the quick will, and make him all her own."
346,YOUTH,
347,YOUTH,"Come, then, as ever, like the Wind at morning!"
348,YOUTH,"Joyous, O Youth, in the aged world renew"
349,YOUTH,"Freshness to feel the eternities around it,"
350,YOUTH,"Rains, stars, and clouds, light and the sacred dew."
351,YOUTH,The strong sun shines above thee:
352,YOUTH,"That strength, that radiance bring!"
353,YOUTH,"If Winter come to Winter,"
354,YOUTH,When shall men hope for Spring?

558,RAYMOND AND IDA,_Ida._
559,RAYMOND AND IDA,
560,RAYMOND AND IDA,To leave the blessed light:

604,RAYMOND AND IDA,"We bear, a charm of might."

629,PSYCHE,"Gentle to all, to all doth teach"
630,PSYCHE,The charm of deeming nothing vain.
631,PSYCHE,
632,PSYCHE,She join'd me: and we wander'd on;
633,PSYCHE,"And I rejoiced, I cared not why,"
634,PSYCHE,Deeming it immortality
635,PSYCHE,To walk with such a soul alone.
636,PSYCHE,"Primroses pale grew all around,"

647,PSYCHE,"Upon her perfect cheek was shed,"
648,PSYCHE,And in her eyes a purer blue.
649,PSYCHE,
650,PSYCHE,There came an end to break the spell;
651,PSYCHE,She murmur'd something in my ear;
652,PSYCHE,"The words fell vague, I did not hear,"

654,PSYCHE,"And homeward went, with happy heart"

656,PSYCHE,"Rapt to a Paradise apart,"
657,PSYCHE,With all the world become a dream.
658,PSYCHE,

661,PSYCHE,"The pride of passion, hopes made vain,"
662,PSYCHE,"The wounds, the weariness, of life."
663,PSYCHE,"And losing that forgetful sphere,"
664,PSYCHE,"For some less troubled world I sigh,"
665,PSYCHE,"If not divine, more free, more clear,"
666,PSYCHE,"Than this poor, soil'd humanity."
667,PSYCHE,
668,PSYCHE,"But when, in trances of the night,"
669,PSYCHE,"Wakeful, my lonely bed I keep,"
670,PSYCHE,"And linger at the gate of Sleep,"
671,PSYCHE,"Fearing, lest dreams deny me light;"

673,PSYCHE,"With her pale features moulded fair,"
674,PSYCHE,"Her breathing beauty, morning bloom,"
675,PSYCHE,"My heart's delight, my tongue's despair."
676,PSYCHE,
677,PSYCHE,"With loving hand she touches mine,"
678,PSYCHE,"Showers her soft tresses on my brow,"
679,PSYCHE,"And heals my heart, I know not how,"
680,PSYCHE,Bathing me with her looks divine.
681,PSYCHE,She beckons me; and I arise;
682,PSYCHE,"And, grief no more remembering,"
683,PSYCHE,Wander again with rapturous eyes
684,PSYCHE,Through those enchanted lands of Spring.
685,PSYCHE,
686,PSYCHE,"Then, as I walk with her in peace,"
687,PSYCHE,"I leave this troubled air below,"
688,PSYCHE,"Where, hurrying sadly to and fro,"
689,PSYCHE,"Men toil, and strain, and cannot cease:"
690,PSYCHE,"Then, freed from tyrannous Fate's control,"
691,PSYCHE,"Untouch'd by years or grief, I see"
692,PSYCHE,Transfigured in that child-like soul
693,PSYCHE,The soil'd soul of humanity.

892,ORESTES,"That rear'd me, all the sweetness of old days"
893,ORESTES,"Came back on me: I stood, as from a dream"
894,ORESTES,"Waked to a sudden, sad reality."
895,ORESTES,"And when, far off, I saw those ancient towers,"
896,ORESTES,"The palaces and places of my youth,"
897,ORESTES,"I long'd to fall into my mother's arms,"
898,ORESTES,And tell a thousand tales of near escapes.
899,ORESTES,"And lo! the nurse, that fondled me of yore,"
900,ORESTES,"Fell with glad tears upon my neck, and told"
901,ORESTES,"How she, and how my mother, all this while"
902,ORESTES,"Had dream'd of all I was to do, and said"
903,ORESTES,How dear I should be to my mother's eyes.
904,ORESTES,"Her words shook me, but shook not my resolve."
905,ORESTES,"For even then there came that sterner voice,"
906,ORESTES,Echoing to what was highest in the soul.
907,ORESTES,"Then, like to those who have a work on earth,"
908,ORESTES,"And put far from them lips of wife or child,"
909,ORESTES,And gird them to the accomplishment; so I
910,ORESTES,"Strode in, nor saw at all mine ancient halls;"
911,ORESTES,"And struck my father's murderess, not my mother."
912,ORESTES,"And, when I had smitten, lo, the strength of gods"
913,ORESTES,"Pass'd from me, and the old, familiar halls"
914,ORESTES,"Reel'd back on me; dim statues, that of old"
915,ORESTES,"Holding my mother's hand I marvell'd at,"
916,ORESTES,"And questioned her of each. And she lies there,"
917,ORESTES,"My mother! ay, my mother now; O hair"
918,ORESTES,That once I play'd with in these halls! O eyes
919,ORESTES,"That for a moment knew me as I came,"
920,ORESTES,"And lighten'd up, and trembled into love;"
921,ORESTES,The next were darkened by my hand! Ah me!
922,ORESTES,Ye will not look upon me in that world.
923,ORESTES,"Yet thou, perchance, art happier, if thou go'st"
924,ORESTES,"Into some land of wind and drifting leaves,"
925,ORESTES,"To sleep without a star; but as for me,"
926,ORESTES,"Hell hungers, and the restless Furies wait."
927,ORESTES,"Then the dark Curse, that sits upon the towers,"
928,ORESTES,"Bow'd down her awful head, thus satisfied,"
929,ORESTES,"And I fled forth, a murderer, through the world."

987,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,
988,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Now lonely is the wood:
989,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"No flower now lingers, none!"
990,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,The virgin sisterhood
991,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"Of roses, all are gone;"
992,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Now Autumn sheds her latest leaf;
993,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,And in my heart is grief.
994,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,
995,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"Ah me, for all earth rears,"
996,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,The appointed bound is placed!
997,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,After a thousand years
998,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,The great oak falls at last:
999,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"And thou, more lovely, canst not stay,"
1000,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"Sweet rose, beyond thy day."
1001,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,
1002,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Our life is not the life
1003,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Of roses and of leaves;
1004,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"Else wherefore this deep strife,"
1005,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"This pain, our soul conceives?"
1006,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,The fall of ev'n such short-lived things
1007,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,To us some sorrow brings.
1008,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,
1009,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"And yet, plant, bird, and fly"
1010,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Feel no such hidden fire.
1011,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Happy they live; and die
1012,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"Happy, with no desire."
1013,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,They in their brief life have fulfill'd
1014,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,All Nature in them will'd.
1015,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,
1016,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,And were we also made
1017,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Of like terrestrial mould
1018,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"We should not be afraid,"
1019,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Nor feel the grave so cold;
1020,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"But, all oblivious of our fate,"
1021,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Live sweetly out our date.
1022,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,
1023,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,For the great mother loves
1024,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Her children far too well;
1025,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,These longings that she moves
1026,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Their own fulfilment tell:
1027,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,She would not burden us with aught
1028,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,We really needed not.
1029,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,
1030,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"O, not in vain she gave"
1031,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,To the wild birds their wings!
1032,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"They spread them forth, and have"
1033,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Heaven for their wanderings.
1034,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"But we, to whom no wings are given"
1035,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Why seek we for a Heaven?
1036,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,
1037,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"And, when far o'er us fly"
1038,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"Those voyagers of the air,"
1039,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"Why must we gaze, and sigh,"
1040,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,_O would that I were there?_
1041,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"Why are we restless, ill content,"
1042,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Tied to one element?
1043,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,
1044,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,'Tis not that in our tears
1045,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Some happier life we crave;
1046,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"Our happiest, sweetest years"
1047,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Mysterious moments have:
1048,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,The sense of our brief human lot
1049,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"Clings to us, haunts our thought."
1050,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,
1051,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,O then this pleasant earth
1052,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Seems but an alien thing:
1053,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Faint grows her busy mirth;
1054,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Far hence our thoughts take wing:
1055,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,For some enduring home we cry!
1056,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"She cannot satisfy,"
1057,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,
1058,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Or bind us: only ties
1059,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Immortal found can bless;
1060,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Only in loving eyes
1061,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,We see our happiness;
1062,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Only upon a loving breast
1063,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Our souls find any rest.
1064,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,
1065,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Why thirsts the spirit so
1066,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,For life? what moves it thus?
1067,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"'Tis _her_ voice; yes, I know,"
1068,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,'Tis Nature cries in us:
1069,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,'Tis no unholy strife of ours
1070,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Against forbidding powers.
1071,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,
1072,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"What though we gaze with fear,"
1073,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,So blank death seems to be;
1074,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,What though no land appear
1075,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Beyond that lonely sea;
1076,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Still in our hearts her cry doth stay;
1077,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,She will find out a way.
1078,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,
1079,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,So in the chrysalis
1080,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Slumber those lovely wings;
1081,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,So from the shell it is
1082,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,The dazzling pearl she brings:
1083,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,"Her glorious works she works alone,"
1084,MENTEM MORTALIA TANGUNT,Unfathom'd and unknown!
