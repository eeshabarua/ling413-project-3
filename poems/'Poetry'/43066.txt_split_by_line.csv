50,CHAPTER I.,
51,CHAPTER I.,
52,CHAPTER I.,An idle story with an idle moral!
53,CHAPTER I.,"Why do I tell it, at the risk of quarrel"
54,CHAPTER I.,"With nobler themes? The world, alas! is so,"
55,CHAPTER I.,"And who would gather truth must bend him low,"
56,CHAPTER I.,"Nor fear to soil his knees with graveyard ground,"
57,CHAPTER I.,If haply there some flower of truth be found.
58,CHAPTER I.,"For human nature is an earthy fruit,"
59,CHAPTER I.,"Mired at the stem and fleshy at the root,"
60,CHAPTER I.,"And thrives with folly's mixon best o'erlaid,"
61,CHAPTER I.,"Nor less divinely so, when all is said."
62,CHAPTER I.,"Brave lives are lived, and worthy deeds are done"
63,CHAPTER I.,"Each virtuous day, 'neath the all-pitying sun;"
64,CHAPTER I.,"But these are not the most, perhaps not even"
65,CHAPTER I.,The surest road to our soul's modern heaven.
66,CHAPTER I.,The best of us are creatures of God's chance
67,CHAPTER I.,"(Call it His grace), which works deliverance;"
68,CHAPTER I.,"The rest mere pendulums 'twixt good and ill,"
69,CHAPTER I.,Like soldiers marking time while standing still.
70,CHAPTER I.,"'Tis all their strategy, who have lost faith"
71,CHAPTER I.,"In things Divine beyond man's life and death,"
72,CHAPTER I.,"Pleasure and pain. Of heaven what know we,"
73,CHAPTER I.,"Save as unfit for angels' company,"
74,CHAPTER I.,"Say rather hell's? We cling to sins confessed,"
75,CHAPTER I.,And say our prayers still hoping for the best.
76,CHAPTER I.,"We fear old age and ugliness and pain,"
77,CHAPTER I.,"And love our lives, nor look to live again."
78,CHAPTER I.,
79,CHAPTER I.,"I do but parable the crowd I know,"
80,CHAPTER I.,"The human cattle grazing as they go,"
81,CHAPTER I.,Unheedful of the heavens. Here and there
82,CHAPTER I.,"Some prouder, may be, or less hungry steer"
83,CHAPTER I.,"Lifting his face an instant to the sky,"
84,CHAPTER I.,"And left behind as the bent herd goes by,"
85,CHAPTER I.,"Or stung to a short madness, tossing wild"
86,CHAPTER I.,"His horns aloft, and charging the gay field,"
87,CHAPTER I.,"Till the fence stops him, and he vanquished too,"
88,CHAPTER I.,Turns to his browsing--lost his Waterloo.
89,CHAPTER I.,
90,CHAPTER I.,The moral of my tale I leave to others
91,CHAPTER I.,"More bold, who point the finger at their brothers,"
92,CHAPTER I.,And surer know than I which way is best
93,CHAPTER I.,"To virtue's goal, where all of us find rest,"
94,CHAPTER I.,"Whether in stern denial of things sweet,"
95,CHAPTER I.,"Or yielding timely, lest life lose its feet"
96,CHAPTER I.,And fall the further.
97,CHAPTER I.,
98,CHAPTER I.,A plain tale is mine
99,CHAPTER I.,"Of naked fact, unconscious of design,"
100,CHAPTER I.,Told of the world in this last century
101,CHAPTER I.,"Of man's (not God's) disgrace, the XIXth. We"
102,CHAPTER I.,Have made it all a little as it is
103,CHAPTER I.,"In our own images and likenesses,"
104,CHAPTER I.,And need the more forgiveness for our sin.
105,CHAPTER I.,
106,CHAPTER I.,"Therefore, my Muse, impatient to begin,"
107,CHAPTER I.,I bid thee fearless forward on thy road:
108,CHAPTER I.,Steer thou thy honest course 'twixt bad and good.
109,CHAPTER I.,"Know this, in art that thing alone is evil"
110,CHAPTER I.,Which shuns the one plain word that shames the devil.
111,CHAPTER I.,"Tell truth without preamble or excuse,"
112,CHAPTER I.,"And all shall be forgiven thee--all, my Muse!"

115,CHAPTER I.,
116,CHAPTER I.,In London then not many years ago
117,CHAPTER I.,"There lived a lady of high fashion, who"
118,CHAPTER I.,"For her friends' sake, if any still there be"
119,CHAPTER I.,"Who hold her virtues green in memory,"
120,CHAPTER I.,Shall not be further named in this true tale
121,CHAPTER I.,"Than as Griselda or the Lady L.,"
122,CHAPTER I.,"Such, if I err not, was the second name"
123,CHAPTER I.,"Her parents gave when to the font she came,"
124,CHAPTER I.,And such the initial letter bravely set
125,CHAPTER I.,"On her coach door, beneath the coronet,"
126,CHAPTER I.,"Which bore her and her fortunes--bore, alas!"
127,CHAPTER I.,"For, as in this sad world all things must pass,"
128,CHAPTER I.,However great and nobly framed and fair:
129,CHAPTER I.,"Griselda, too, is of the things that were."
130,CHAPTER I.,
131,CHAPTER I.,But while she lived Griselda had no need
132,CHAPTER I.,Of the world's pity. She was proudly bred
133,CHAPTER I.,And proudly nurtured. Plenty her full horn
134,CHAPTER I.,"Had fairly emptied out when she was born,"
135,CHAPTER I.,And dowered her with all bounties. She was fair
136,CHAPTER I.,"As only children of the noblest are,"
137,CHAPTER I.,"And brave and strong and opulent of health,"
138,CHAPTER I.,Which made her take full pleasure of her wealth.
139,CHAPTER I.,She had a pitying scorn of little souls
140,CHAPTER I.,"And little bodies, levying heavy tolls"
141,CHAPTER I.,On all the world which was less strong than she.
142,CHAPTER I.,"She used her natural strength most naturally,"
143,CHAPTER I.,"And yet with due discretion, so that all"
144,CHAPTER I.,Stood equally in bondage to her thrall.
145,CHAPTER I.,She was of that high godlike shape and size
146,CHAPTER I.,Which has authority in all men's eyes:
147,CHAPTER I.,"Her hair was brown, her colour white and red,"
148,CHAPTER I.,Nor idly moved to blush. She held her head
149,CHAPTER I.,"Straight with her back. Her body, from the knee"
150,CHAPTER I.,"Tall and clean shaped, like some well-nurtured tree,"
151,CHAPTER I.,Rose finely finished to the finger tips;
152,CHAPTER I.,"She had a noble carriage of the hips,"
153,CHAPTER I.,And that proportionate waist which only art
154,CHAPTER I.,"Dares to divine, harmonious part with part."
155,CHAPTER I.,"But of this more anon, or rather never."
156,CHAPTER I.,All that the world could vaunt for its endeavour
157,CHAPTER I.,Was the fair promise of her ankles set
158,CHAPTER I.,"Upon a pair of small high-instepped feet,"
159,CHAPTER I.,"In whose behalf, though modestly, God wot,"
160,CHAPTER I.,"As any nun, she raised her petticoat"
161,CHAPTER I.,One little inch more high than reason meet
162,CHAPTER I.,Was for one crossing a well-besomed street.
163,CHAPTER I.,This was the only tribute she allowed
164,CHAPTER I.,To human folly and the envious crowd;
165,CHAPTER I.,Nor for my part would I be found her judge
166,CHAPTER I.,"For her one weakness, nor appear to grudge"
167,CHAPTER I.,"What in myself, as surely in the rest,"
168,CHAPTER I.,Bred strange sweet fancies such as feet suggest.
169,CHAPTER I.,"We owe her all too much. This point apart,"
170,CHAPTER I.,"Griselda, modesty's own counterpart,"
171,CHAPTER I.,"Moved in the sphere of folly like a star,"
172,CHAPTER I.,Aloof and bright and most particular.
173,CHAPTER I.,
174,CHAPTER I.,By girlish choice and whim of her first will
175,CHAPTER I.,"She had espoused the amiable Lord L.,"
176,CHAPTER I.,"A worthy nobleman, in high repute"
177,CHAPTER I.,"For wealth and virtue, and her kin to boot;"
178,CHAPTER I.,"A silent man, well mannered and well dressed,"
179,CHAPTER I.,"Courteous, deliberate, kind, sublimely blessed"
180,CHAPTER I.,"With fortune's favours, but without pretence,"
181,CHAPTER I.,Whom manners almost made a man of sense.
182,CHAPTER I.,In early life he had aspired to fame
183,CHAPTER I.,In the world of letters by the stratagem
184,CHAPTER I.,"Of a new issue, from his private press,"
185,CHAPTER I.,"Of classic bards in senatorial dress,"
186,CHAPTER I.,"""_In usum Marchionis._"" He had spent"
187,CHAPTER I.,"Much of his youth upon the Continent,"
188,CHAPTER I.,"Purchasing marbles, bronzes, pictures, gems,"
189,CHAPTER I.,"In every town from Tiber unto Thames,"
190,CHAPTER I.,And gaining store of curious knowledge too
191,CHAPTER I.,On divers subjects that the world least knew:
192,CHAPTER I.,"Knowledge uncatalogued, and overlaid"
193,CHAPTER I.,With dust and lumber somewhere in his head.
194,CHAPTER I.,"A slumberous man, in whom the lamp of life"
195,CHAPTER I.,Had never quite been lighted for the strife
196,CHAPTER I.,"And turmoil of the world, but flickered down"
197,CHAPTER I.,"In an uncertain twilight of its own,"
198,CHAPTER I.,"With an occasional flash, that only made"
199,CHAPTER I.,A deeper shadow for its world of shade.
200,CHAPTER I.,"When he returned to England, all admired"
201,CHAPTER I.,"The taste of his collections, and inquired"
202,CHAPTER I.,To whose fair fortunate head the lot should fall
203,CHAPTER I.,To wear these gems and jewels after all.
204,CHAPTER I.,"But years went by, and still unclaimed they shone,"
205,CHAPTER I.,"A snare and stumbling-block to more than one,"
206,CHAPTER I.,"Till in his fiftieth year 'twas vaguely said,"
207,CHAPTER I.,Lord L. already had too long delayed.
208,CHAPTER I.,"Be it as it may, he abdicated life"
209,CHAPTER I.,The day he took Griselda to his wife.
210,CHAPTER I.,
211,CHAPTER I.,"And then Griselda loved him. All agreed,"
212,CHAPTER I.,"The world's chief sponsors for its social creed,"
213,CHAPTER I.,"That, whether poor Lord L. was or was not"
214,CHAPTER I.,"The very fool some said and idiot,"
215,CHAPTER I.,"Or whether under cloak of dulness crass,"
216,CHAPTER I.,"He veiled that sense best suited to his case,"
217,CHAPTER I.,"Sparing his wit, as housewives spare their light,"
218,CHAPTER I.,For curtain eloquence and dead of night;
219,CHAPTER I.,"And spite of whispered tales obscurely spread,"
220,CHAPTER I.,"Doubting the fortunes of her nuptial bed,"
221,CHAPTER I.,Here at this word all sides agreed to rest:
222,CHAPTER I.,Griselda did her duty with the best.
223,CHAPTER I.,
224,CHAPTER I.,"Yet, poor Griselda! When in lusty youth"
225,CHAPTER I.,"A love-sick boy I stood unformed, uncouth,"
226,CHAPTER I.,And watched with sad and ever jealous eye
227,CHAPTER I.,"The vision of your beauty passing by,"
228,CHAPTER I.,"Why was it that that brow inviolate,"
229,CHAPTER I.,"That virginal courage yet unscared by fate,"
230,CHAPTER I.,That look the immortal queen and huntress wore
231,CHAPTER I.,To frightened shepherds' eyes in days of yore
232,CHAPTER I.,"Consoled me thus, and soothed unconsciously,"
233,CHAPTER I.,And stilled my jealous fears I knew not why?
234,CHAPTER I.,How shall I tell the secret of your soul
235,CHAPTER I.,"Which then I blindly guessed, or how cajole"
236,CHAPTER I.,My boyhood's ancient folly to declare
237,CHAPTER I.,"Now in my wisdom the dear maid you were,"
238,CHAPTER I.,Though such the truth?
239,CHAPTER I.,
240,CHAPTER I.,Griselda's early days
241,CHAPTER I.,Of married life were not that fitful maze
242,CHAPTER I.,"Of tears and laughter which betoken aught,"
243,CHAPTER I.,"Changed or exchanged, of pain with pleasure bought,"
244,CHAPTER I.,"Of maiden freedom conquered and subdued,"
245,CHAPTER I.,Of hopes new born and fears of womanhood.
246,CHAPTER I.,Those who then saw Griselda saw a child
247,CHAPTER I.,"Well pleased and happy, thoughtlessly beguiled"
248,CHAPTER I.,"By every simplest pleasure of her age,"
249,CHAPTER I.,"Gay as a bird just issued from its cage,"
250,CHAPTER I.,When every flower is sweet. No eye could trace
251,CHAPTER I.,"Doubt or disquiet written on her face,"
252,CHAPTER I.,"Where none there was. And, if the truth be told,"
253,CHAPTER I.,Griselda grieved not that Lord L. was old.
254,CHAPTER I.,She found it well that her sweet seventeen
255,CHAPTER I.,"Should live at peace with fifty, and was seen"
256,CHAPTER I.,"Just as she felt, contented with her lot,"
257,CHAPTER I.,Pleased with what was and pleased with what was not.
258,CHAPTER I.,She held her husband the more dear that he
259,CHAPTER I.,"Was kind within the bounds of courtesy,"
260,CHAPTER I.,"And love was not as yet within her plan,"
261,CHAPTER I.,"And life was fair, and wisdom led the van."
262,CHAPTER I.,
263,CHAPTER I.,"For she was wise--oh, wise! She rose at eight"
264,CHAPTER I.,"And played her scales till breakfast, and then sat"
265,CHAPTER I.,"The morning through with staid and serious looks,"
266,CHAPTER I.,"Counting the columns of her household books,"
267,CHAPTER I.,"Her daily labour, or with puzzled head"
268,CHAPTER I.,"Bent over languages alive and dead,"
269,CHAPTER I.,"Wise as, alas! in life those only are"
270,CHAPTER I.,Who have not yet beheld a twentieth year.
271,CHAPTER I.,"Wealth had its duties, time its proper use,"
272,CHAPTER I.,Youth and her marriage should be no excuse;
273,CHAPTER I.,Her education must be made complete!
274,CHAPTER I.,Lord L. looked on and quite approved of it.
275,CHAPTER I.,"The afternoons, in sense of duty done,"
276,CHAPTER I.,Went by more idly than the rest had gone.
277,CHAPTER I.,"If in the country, which Lord L. preferred,"
278,CHAPTER I.,"She had her horse, her dogs, her favourite bird,"
279,CHAPTER I.,"Her own rose-garden, which she loved to rake,"
280,CHAPTER I.,"Her fish to feed with bread crumbs in the lake,"
281,CHAPTER I.,"Her schools, old women, poor and almshouses,"
282,CHAPTER I.,"Her sick to visit, or her church to dress."
283,CHAPTER I.,Lord L. was pleased to see her bountiful:
284,CHAPTER I.,They hardly found the time to find it dull.
285,CHAPTER I.,
286,CHAPTER I.,"In London, where they spent their second year,"
287,CHAPTER I.,Came occupations suited to the sphere
288,CHAPTER I.,In which they lived; and to the just pretence
289,CHAPTER I.,"Of our Griselda's high-born consequence,"
290,CHAPTER I.,New duties to the world which no excuse
291,CHAPTER I.,Admitted. She was mistress of L. House
292,CHAPTER I.,And heir to its traditions. These must be
293,CHAPTER I.,Observed by her in due solemnity.
294,CHAPTER I.,"Her natural taste, I think, repelled the noise,"
295,CHAPTER I.,"The rush, and dust, and crush of London joys;"
296,CHAPTER I.,"But habit, which becomes a second sense,"
297,CHAPTER I.,Had reconciled her to its influence
298,CHAPTER I.,"Even in girlhood, and she long had known"
299,CHAPTER I.,"That life in crowds may still be life alone,"
300,CHAPTER I.,While mere timidity and want of ease
301,CHAPTER I.,She never ranked among youth's miseries.
302,CHAPTER I.,"She had her parents too, who made demand"
303,CHAPTER I.,"Upon her thoughts and time, and close at hand"
304,CHAPTER I.,Sisters and friends. With these her days were spent
305,CHAPTER I.,In simple joys and girlish merriment.
306,CHAPTER I.,She would not own that being called a wife
307,CHAPTER I.,Should make a difference in her daily life.
308,CHAPTER I.,
309,CHAPTER I.,Then London lacks not of attractions fit
310,CHAPTER I.,"For serious minds, and treasures infinite"
311,CHAPTER I.,"Of art and science for ingenious eyes,"
312,CHAPTER I.,"And learning for such wits as would be wise,"
313,CHAPTER I.,"Lectures in classes, galleries, schools of art:"
314,CHAPTER I.,In each Griselda played conspicuous part--
315,CHAPTER I.,"Pupil and patron, ay, and patron-saint"
316,CHAPTER I.,To no few poor who live by pens and paint.
317,CHAPTER I.,"The world admired and flattered as a friend,"
318,CHAPTER I.,And only wondered what would be the end.
319,CHAPTER I.,
320,CHAPTER I.,"And so the days went by. Griselda's face,"
321,CHAPTER I.,"Calm in its outline of romantic grace,"
322,CHAPTER I.,Became a type even to the vulgar mind
323,CHAPTER I.,"Of all that beauty means when most refined,"
324,CHAPTER I.,"The visible symbol of a soul within,"
325,CHAPTER I.,"Conceived immaculate of human sin,"
326,CHAPTER I.,And only clothed in our humanity
327,CHAPTER I.,That we may learn to praise and better be.
328,CHAPTER I.,"Where'er she went, instinctively the crowd"
329,CHAPTER I.,"Made way before her, and ungrudging bowed"
330,CHAPTER I.,"To one so fair as to a queen of earth,"
331,CHAPTER I.,Ruling by right of conquest and of birth.
332,CHAPTER I.,
333,CHAPTER I.,"And thus I first beheld her, standing calm"
334,CHAPTER I.,"In the swayed crowd upon her husband's arm,"
335,CHAPTER I.,"One opera night, the centre of all eyes,"
336,CHAPTER I.,"So proud she seemed, so fair, so sweet, so wise."
337,CHAPTER I.,"Some one behind me whispered ""Lady L.!"
338,CHAPTER I.,"His Lordship too! and thereby hangs a tale."""
339,CHAPTER I.,
340,CHAPTER I.,"His Lordship! I beheld a placid man,"
341,CHAPTER I.,"With gentle deep-set eyes, and rather wan,"
342,CHAPTER I.,"And rather withered, yet on whose smooth face"
343,CHAPTER I.,Time seemed to have been in doubt what lines to trace
344,CHAPTER I.,"Of youth or age, and so had left it bare,"
345,CHAPTER I.,As it had left its colour to his hair.
346,CHAPTER I.,"An old young man perhaps, or really old,"
347,CHAPTER I.,Which of the two could never quite be told.
348,CHAPTER I.,I judged him younger than his years gave right:
349,CHAPTER I.,His looks betrayed him least by candlelight.
350,CHAPTER I.,"Yet, young or old, that night he seemed to me"
351,CHAPTER I.,"Sublime, the priest of her divinity"
352,CHAPTER I.,At whose new shrine I worshipped. But enough
353,CHAPTER I.,Of me and my concerns! More pertinent stuff
354,CHAPTER I.,"My tale requires than this first boyish love,"
355,CHAPTER I.,Which never found the hour its fate to prove.
356,CHAPTER I.,My Lady smiling motions with her hand;
357,CHAPTER I.,"The crowd falls back; his Lordship, gravely bland,"
358,CHAPTER I.,Leads down the steps to where his footmen stay
359,CHAPTER I.,In state. Griselda's carriage stops the way!
360,CHAPTER I.,
361,CHAPTER I.,"And was Griselda happy? Happy?--Yes,"
362,CHAPTER I.,"In her first year of marriage, and no less"
363,CHAPTER I.,"Perhaps, too, in her second and her third."
364,CHAPTER I.,"For youth is proud, nor cares its last sad word"
365,CHAPTER I.,"To ask of fate, and not unwilling clings"
366,CHAPTER I.,To what the present hour in triumph brings.
367,CHAPTER I.,"It was enough, as I have said, for her"
368,CHAPTER I.,That she was young and fortunate and fair.
369,CHAPTER I.,"The world that loved her was a lovely world,"
370,CHAPTER I.,The rest she knew not of. Fate had not hurled
371,CHAPTER I.,A single spear as yet against her life.
372,CHAPTER I.,"She would not argue as 'twixt maid and wife,"
373,CHAPTER I.,"Where both were woman, human nature, man,"
374,CHAPTER I.,Which held the nobler place in the world's plan.
375,CHAPTER I.,"Her soul at least was single, and must be"
376,CHAPTER I.,Unmated still through its eternity.
377,CHAPTER I.,"And, even here in life, what reason yet"
378,CHAPTER I.,To doubt or question or despair of Fate?
379,CHAPTER I.,"Her youth, an ample web, before her shone"
380,CHAPTER I.,"For hope to weave its subtlest fancies on,"
381,CHAPTER I.,If she had cared to dream. Her lot was good
382,CHAPTER I.,"Beyond the common lot of womanhood,"
383,CHAPTER I.,"And she would prove her fortune best in this,"
384,CHAPTER I.,That she would not repine at happiness.
385,CHAPTER I.,Thus to her soul she argued as the Spring
386,CHAPTER I.,Brought back its joy to each begotten thing--
387,CHAPTER I.,Begotten and begetting. Who shall say
388,CHAPTER I.,"Which had the better reason, she or they?"
389,CHAPTER I.,
390,CHAPTER I.,In the fourth year a half acknowledged grief
391,CHAPTER I.,Made its appearance in Griselda's life.
392,CHAPTER I.,"Her sisters married, younger both than she,"
393,CHAPTER I.,"Mere children she had thought, and happily."
394,CHAPTER I.,"Each went her way engrossed by her new bliss,"
395,CHAPTER I.,Too gay to guess Griselda's dumb distress.
396,CHAPTER I.,Her home was broken. In their pride they wrote
397,CHAPTER I.,"Things that like swords against her bosom smote,"
398,CHAPTER I.,"The detail of their hopes, and loves, and fears."
399,CHAPTER I.,"Griselda read, and scarce restrained her tears."
400,CHAPTER I.,"Her mother too, the latest fledgling flown,"
401,CHAPTER I.,Had vanished from the world. She was alone.
402,CHAPTER I.,
403,CHAPTER I.,"When she returned to London, earlier"
404,CHAPTER I.,"Than was her custom, in the following year,"
405,CHAPTER I.,"She found her home a desert, dark and gaunt;"
406,CHAPTER I.,"L. House looked emptier, gloomier than its wont."
407,CHAPTER I.,"Griselda sighed, for on the table lay"
408,CHAPTER I.,"Two letters, which announced each in its way"
409,CHAPTER I.,The expected tidings of her sisters' joy.
410,CHAPTER I.,Either was brought to bed--and with a boy.
411,CHAPTER I.,"Her generous heart leaped forth to these in vain,"
412,CHAPTER I.,"It could not cheat a first sharp touch of pain,"
413,CHAPTER I.,But yielded to its sorrow.
414,CHAPTER I.,
415,CHAPTER I.,"That same night,"
416,CHAPTER I.,"Lord L., whose sleep was neither vexed nor light,"
417,CHAPTER I.,"And who for many years had ceased to dream,"
418,CHAPTER I.,Beheld a vision. Slowly he became
419,CHAPTER I.,Aware of a strange light which in his eyes
420,CHAPTER I.,Shone to his vast discomfort and surprise;
421,CHAPTER I.,"And, while perplexed with vague mistrusts and fears,"
422,CHAPTER I.,"He saw a face, Griselda's face, in tears"
423,CHAPTER I.,Before him. She was standing by his bed
424,CHAPTER I.,"Holding a candle. It was cold, she said,"
425,CHAPTER I.,And shivered. And he saw her wrap her shawl
426,CHAPTER I.,About her shoulders closely like a pall.
427,CHAPTER I.,"Why was she there? Why weeping? Why this light,"
428,CHAPTER I.,Burning so brightly in the dead of night?
429,CHAPTER I.,These riddles poor Lord L.'s half-wakened brain
430,CHAPTER I.,"Tried dimly to resolve, but tried in vain."
431,CHAPTER I.,
432,CHAPTER I.,"""I cannot sleep to-night,"" went on the voice,"
433,CHAPTER I.,"""The streets disturb me strangely with their noise,"
434,CHAPTER I.,"The cabs, the striking clocks."" Lord L.'s distress"
435,CHAPTER I.,"Struggled with sleep. He thought he answered ""Yes."""
436,CHAPTER I.,"""What can I do to make me sleep? I am ill,"
437,CHAPTER I.,Unnerv'd to-night. This house is like a well.
438,CHAPTER I.,"Do I disturb you here, and shall I go?"""
439,CHAPTER I.,"Lord L. was moved. He thought he answered ""No."""
440,CHAPTER I.,"""If you would speak, perhaps my tears would stop."
441,CHAPTER I.,"Speak! only speak!"""
442,CHAPTER I.,
443,CHAPTER I.,Lord L. here felt a drop
444,CHAPTER I.,"Upon his hand. She had put down the light,"
445,CHAPTER I.,And sat upon his bed forlornly white
446,CHAPTER I.,And pale and trembling. Her dark hair unbound
447,CHAPTER I.,"Lay on her knees. Her lips moved, but their sound"
448,CHAPTER I.,Came strangely to his ears and half-unheard.
449,CHAPTER I.,He only could remember the last word:
450,CHAPTER I.,"""I am unhappy--listen L.!--alone."""
451,CHAPTER I.,She touched his shoulder and he gave a groan.
452,CHAPTER I.,"""This is too much. You do not hear me. See,"
453,CHAPTER I.,"I cannot stop these tears. Too much!"""
454,CHAPTER I.,
455,CHAPTER I.,And he
456,CHAPTER I.,"Now well awake, looked round him. He could catch"
457,CHAPTER I.,"A gleam of light just vanished, and the latch"
458,CHAPTER I.,Seemed hardly silent. This was all he knew.
459,CHAPTER I.,"He sat some moments doubting what to do,"
460,CHAPTER I.,"Rose, went out, shivered, hearing nothing, crept"
461,CHAPTER I.,"Back to his pillow, where the vision wept"
462,CHAPTER I.,"Or seemed to weep awhile ago, and then"
463,CHAPTER I.,With some disquiet went to sleep again.
464,CHAPTER I.,
465,CHAPTER I.,"Next morning, thinking of his dream, Lord L."
466,CHAPTER I.,Went down to breakfast in intent to tell
467,CHAPTER I.,The story of his vision. But he met
468,CHAPTER I.,"With little sympathy. His wife was late,"
469,CHAPTER I.,And in a hurry for her school of art.
470,CHAPTER I.,His lordship needed time to make a start
471,CHAPTER I.,"On any topic, and no time she gave."
472,CHAPTER I.,"Griselda had appointments she must save,"
473,CHAPTER I.,And could not stop to hear of rhyme or reason--
474,CHAPTER I.,The dream must wait a more convenient season.
475,CHAPTER I.,And so it was not told.
476,CHAPTER I.,
477,CHAPTER I.,"Alas, alas!"
478,CHAPTER I.,"Who shall foretell what wars shall come to pass,"
479,CHAPTER I.,"What woes be wrought, what fates accomplishèd,"
480,CHAPTER I.,"What new dreams dreamt, what new tears vainly shed,"
481,CHAPTER I.,"What doubts, what anguish, what remorse, what fears"
482,CHAPTER I.,Begotten in the womb of what new years!--
483,CHAPTER I.,"And all because of this, that poor Lord L."
484,CHAPTER I.,"Was slow of speech, or that he slept too well!"
485,CHAPTER I.,
486,CHAPTER I.,
487,CHAPTER I.,
488,CHAPTER I.,
489,CHAPTER II.,CHAPTER II.
490,CHAPTER II.,
491,CHAPTER II.,
492,CHAPTER II.,Thus then it was. Griselda's childhood ends
493,CHAPTER II.,With this untoward night; and what portends
494,CHAPTER II.,May only now be guessed by those who read
495,CHAPTER II.,Signs on the earth and wonders overhead.
496,CHAPTER II.,I dare not prophesy.
497,CHAPTER II.,
498,CHAPTER II.,What next appears
499,CHAPTER II.,In the vain record of Griselda's years
500,CHAPTER II.,"Is hardly yet a token, for her life"
501,CHAPTER II.,"Showed little outward sign of change or strife,"
502,CHAPTER II.,Though she was changed and though perhaps at war.
503,CHAPTER II.,Her face still shone untroubled as a star
504,CHAPTER II.,"In the world's firmament, and still she moved,"
505,CHAPTER II.,A creature to be wondered at and loved.
506,CHAPTER II.,"Her zeal, her wit, her talents, her good sense"
507,CHAPTER II.,"Were all unchanged, though each seemed more intense"
508,CHAPTER II.,And lit up with new passion and inspired
509,CHAPTER II.,"To active purpose, valiant and untired."
510,CHAPTER II.,"She faced the world, talked much and well, made friends,"
511,CHAPTER II.,"Promoted divers schemes for divers ends,"
512,CHAPTER II.,"Artistic, social, philanthropical:"
513,CHAPTER II.,She had a store of zeal for each and all.
514,CHAPTER II.,"She pensioned poets, nobly took in hand"
515,CHAPTER II.,"An emigration plan to Newfoundland,"
516,CHAPTER II.,Which ended in disaster and a ball.
517,CHAPTER II.,"She visited St. George's hospital,"
518,CHAPTER II.,"The Home for Fallen Women, founded schools"
519,CHAPTER II.,Of music taught on transcendental rules.
520,CHAPTER II.,L. House was dull though splendid. She had schemes
521,CHAPTER II.,"Of a vast London palace on the Thames,"
522,CHAPTER II.,Which should combine all orders new and old
523,CHAPTER II.,"Of architectural taste a house could hold,"
524,CHAPTER II.,"And educate the masses. Then one day,"
525,CHAPTER II.,She fairly wearied and her soul gave way.
526,CHAPTER II.,
527,CHAPTER II.,"Again she sought Lord L., but not to ask"
528,CHAPTER II.,This time his counsel in the thankless task
529,CHAPTER II.,"She could no more make good, the task of living."
530,CHAPTER II.,"He was too mere a stranger to her grieving,"
531,CHAPTER II.,"Her needs, her weakness. All her woman's heart"
532,CHAPTER II.,Was in rebellion at the idle part
533,CHAPTER II.,"He played in her sad life, and needed not"
534,CHAPTER II.,Mere pity for a pain to madness wrought.
535,CHAPTER II.,She did not ask his sympathy. She said
536,CHAPTER II.,"Only that she was weary as the dead,"
537,CHAPTER II.,"And needed change of air, and life, and scene:"
538,CHAPTER II.,She wished to go where all the world had been--
539,CHAPTER II.,"To Paris, Florence, Rome. She could not die"
540,CHAPTER II.,And not have seen the Alps and Italy.
541,CHAPTER II.,"Lord L. had tried all Europe, and knew best"
542,CHAPTER II.,Where she could flee her troubles and find rest.
543,CHAPTER II.,"Such was her will. Lord L., without more goad,"
544,CHAPTER II.,Prepared for travel--and they went abroad.
545,CHAPTER II.,
546,CHAPTER II.,I will not follow here from day to day
547,CHAPTER II.,Griselda's steps. Suffice it if I say
548,CHAPTER II.,"She found her wished-for Paris wearisome,"
549,CHAPTER II.,"Another London and without her home,"
550,CHAPTER II.,"And so went on, as still the fashion was,"
551,CHAPTER II.,"Some years ago, e'er Pulman cars with gas"
552,CHAPTER II.,And quick night flittings had submerged mankind
553,CHAPTER II.,"In one mad dream of luggage left behind,"
554,CHAPTER II.,By the Rhone boat to Provence. This to her
555,CHAPTER II.,"Seemed a delicious land, strange, barren, fair,"
556,CHAPTER II.,"An old-world wilderness of greys and browns,"
557,CHAPTER II.,"Rocks, olive-gardens, grim dismantled towns,"
558,CHAPTER II.,"Deep-streeted, desolate, yet dear to see,"
559,CHAPTER II.,Smelling of oil and of the Papacy.
560,CHAPTER II.,Griselda first gave reins to her romance
561,CHAPTER II.,"In this forgotten corner of old France,"
562,CHAPTER II.,"Feeding her soul on that ethereal food,"
563,CHAPTER II.,The manna of days spent in solitude.
564,CHAPTER II.,"Lord L. was silent. She, as far away"
565,CHAPTER II.,"Saw other worlds which were not of to-day,"
566,CHAPTER II.,"With cardinals, popes, Petrarch and the Muse."
567,CHAPTER II.,"She stopped to weep with Laura at Vaucluse,"
568,CHAPTER II.,"Where waiting in the Mistral poor Lord L.,"
569,CHAPTER II.,"Who did not weep, sat, slept and caught a chill;"
570,CHAPTER II.,"This sent them southwards on through Christendom,"
571,CHAPTER II.,"To Genoa, Florence, and at last to Rome,"
572,CHAPTER II.,Where they remained the winter.
573,CHAPTER II.,
574,CHAPTER II.,Change had wrought
575,CHAPTER II.,"A cure already in Griselda's thought,"
576,CHAPTER II.,"Or half a cure. The world in truth is wide,"
577,CHAPTER II.,"If we but pace it out from side to side,"
578,CHAPTER II.,And our worst miseries thus the smaller come.
579,CHAPTER II.,"Griselda was ashamed to grieve in Rome,"
580,CHAPTER II.,"Among the buried griefs of centuries,"
581,CHAPTER II.,Her own sweet soul's too pitiful disease.
582,CHAPTER II.,She found amid that dust of human hopes
583,CHAPTER II.,"An incantation for all horoscopes,"
584,CHAPTER II.,A better patience in that wreck of Time:
585,CHAPTER II.,Her secret woes seemed chastened and sublime
586,CHAPTER II.,There in the amphitheatre of woe.
587,CHAPTER II.,"She suffered with the martyrs. These would know,"
588,CHAPTER II.,"Who offered their chaste lives and virgin blood,"
589,CHAPTER II.,How mortal frailty best might be subdued.
590,CHAPTER II.,She saw the incense of her sorrow rise
591,CHAPTER II.,With theirs as an accepted sacrifice
592,CHAPTER II.,Before the face of the Eternal God
593,CHAPTER II.,"Of that Eternal City, and she trod"
594,CHAPTER II.,The very stones which seemed their griefs to sound
595,CHAPTER II.,"Beneath her steps, as consecrated ground."
596,CHAPTER II.,In face of such a suffering hers must be
597,CHAPTER II.,"A drop, a tear in the unbounded sea"
598,CHAPTER II.,"Which girds our lives. Rome was the home of grief,"
599,CHAPTER II.,"Where all might bring their pain and find relief,"
600,CHAPTER II.,"The temple of all sorrows: surely yet,"
601,CHAPTER II.,Sorrow's self here seemed swallowed up in it.
602,CHAPTER II.,
603,CHAPTER II.,"'Twas thus she comforted her soul. And then,"
604,CHAPTER II.,"She had found a friend, a phoenix among men,"
605,CHAPTER II.,"Which made it easier to compound with life,"
606,CHAPTER II.,Easier to be a woman and a wife.
607,CHAPTER II.,
608,CHAPTER II.,This was Prince Belgirate. He of all
609,CHAPTER II.,The noble band to whose high fortune fall
610,CHAPTER II.,The name and title proudest upon earth
611,CHAPTER II.,"While pride shall live by privilege of birth,"
612,CHAPTER II.,"The name of Roman, shone conspicuous"
613,CHAPTER II.,"The head and front of his illustrious house,"
614,CHAPTER II.,Which had produced two pontiffs and a saint
615,CHAPTER II.,Before the world had heard of Charles le Quint;
616,CHAPTER II.,"A most accomplished nobleman in truth,"
617,CHAPTER II.,"And wise beyond the manner of his youth,"
618,CHAPTER II.,"With wit and art and learning, and that sense"
619,CHAPTER II.,Of policy which still is most intense
620,CHAPTER II.,"Among the fertile brains of Italy,"
621,CHAPTER II.,A craft inherited from days gone by.
622,CHAPTER II.,As scholar he was known the pupil apt
623,CHAPTER II.,"Of Mezzofanti, in whose learning lapped"
624,CHAPTER II.,"And prized and tutored as a wondrous child,"
625,CHAPTER II.,He had sucked the milk of knowledge undefiled
626,CHAPTER II.,"While yet a boy, and brilliantly anon"
627,CHAPTER II.,Had pushed his reputation thus begun
628,CHAPTER II.,Through half a score of tongues. In art his place
629,CHAPTER II.,"Was as chief patron of the rising race,"
630,CHAPTER II.,Which dreamed new conquests on the glorious womb
631,CHAPTER II.,Of ancient beauty laid asleep in Rome.
632,CHAPTER II.,The glories of the past he fain would see
633,CHAPTER II.,"Wrought to new life in this new century,"
634,CHAPTER II.,"By that continuous instinct of her sons,"
635,CHAPTER II.,"Which had survived Goths, Vandals, Lombards, Huns,"
636,CHAPTER II.,To burst upon a wondering world again
637,CHAPTER II.,With full effulgence in the Julian reign.
638,CHAPTER II.,
639,CHAPTER II.,"In politics, though prudently withdrawn"
640,CHAPTER II.,"From the public service, which he held in scorn,"
641,CHAPTER II.,As being unworthy the deliberate zeal
642,CHAPTER II.,Of one with head to think or heart to feel;
643,CHAPTER II.,"And being neither priest, nor soldier, nor"
644,CHAPTER II.,"Versed in the practice of Canonic lore,"
645,CHAPTER II.,He made his counsels felt and privately
646,CHAPTER II.,"Lent his best influence to ""the Powers that be,""--"
647,CHAPTER II.,Counsels the better valued that he stood
648,CHAPTER II.,"Alone among the youth of stirring blood,"
649,CHAPTER II.,"And bowed not to that Baal his proud knee,"
650,CHAPTER II.,"The national false goddess, Italy."
651,CHAPTER II.,He was too stubborn in his Roman pride
652,CHAPTER II.,"To trick out this young strumpet as a bride,"
653,CHAPTER II.,And held in classic scorn who would become
654,CHAPTER II.,Less than a Roman citizen in Rome.
655,CHAPTER II.,A man of heart besides and that light wit
656,CHAPTER II.,"Which leavens all, even pedantry's conceit."
657,CHAPTER II.,None better knew than he the art to shew
658,CHAPTER II.,A little less in talk than all he knew.
659,CHAPTER II.,"His manner too, and voice, and countenance,"
660,CHAPTER II.,"Imposed on all, and these he knew to enhance"
661,CHAPTER II.,By certain freedoms and simplicities
662,CHAPTER II.,"Of language, which set all his world at ease."
663,CHAPTER II.,"A very peer and prince and paragon,"
664,CHAPTER II.,"Griselda thought, Rome's latest, worthiest son,"
665,CHAPTER II.,An intellectual phoenix.
666,CHAPTER II.,
667,CHAPTER II.,On her night
668,CHAPTER II.,"A sudden dawn had broke, portentous, bright."
669,CHAPTER II.,Her soul had found its fellow. From the day
670,CHAPTER II.,"Of their first meeting on the Appian Way,"
671,CHAPTER II.,"Beside Metella's tomb, where they had discussed"
672,CHAPTER II.,"The doubtful merit of a new found bust,"
673,CHAPTER II.,"And had agreed to differ or agree,"
674,CHAPTER II.,"I know not which, a hidden sympathy"
675,CHAPTER II.,Had taken root between them. Either mind
676,CHAPTER II.,Found in the other tokens of its kind
677,CHAPTER II.,"Which spoke in more than words, and naturally"
678,CHAPTER II.,Leaned to its fellow-mind as tree to tree.
679,CHAPTER II.,"Lord L., who had known the prince in other days,"
680,CHAPTER II.,"While riding home had spoken in his praise,"
681,CHAPTER II.,"And won Griselda's heart and patient smile,"
682,CHAPTER II.,For divers threadbare tales of blameless guile
683,CHAPTER II.,"Among the virtuosi, where the prince"
684,CHAPTER II.,"Had played his part with skill and influence,"
685,CHAPTER II.,"His sworn ally. Lord L. grew eloquent,"
686,CHAPTER II.,"Finding her ears such rapt attention lent,"
687,CHAPTER II.,And could have gone on talking all his life
688,CHAPTER II.,About his friend's perfections to his wife.
689,CHAPTER II.,
690,CHAPTER II.,Griselda listened. In her heart there stirred
691,CHAPTER II.,"A strange unconscious pleasure at each word,"
692,CHAPTER II.,Which made the sunshine brighter and the sky
693,CHAPTER II.,"More blue, more tender in its sympathy."
694,CHAPTER II.,The hills of the Campagna crowned with snow
695,CHAPTER II.,"Moved her and touched, she knew not why nor how."
696,CHAPTER II.,The solemn beauty of the world; the fate
697,CHAPTER II.,"Of all things living, vast and inchoate"
698,CHAPTER II.,Yet clothed with flowers; the soul's eternal dream
699,CHAPTER II.,Of something still beyond; the passionate whim
700,CHAPTER II.,"Of every noble mind for something good,"
701,CHAPTER II.,Which should assuage its hunger with new food;
702,CHAPTER II.,"The thrill of hope, the pulse of happiness,"
703,CHAPTER II.,The vague half-conscious longing of the eyes--
704,CHAPTER II.,"All these appealed to her, and seemed to lie"
705,CHAPTER II.,"In form and substance under the blue sky,"
706,CHAPTER II.,Filling the shadows of the Sabine Hills
707,CHAPTER II.,"As with a presence, till her natural ills,"
708,CHAPTER II.,"Transfigured through a happy mist of tears,"
709,CHAPTER II.,Gave place to hopes yet hardly dreamed as hers.
710,CHAPTER II.,"And still Lord L. talked calmly on, and she"
711,CHAPTER II.,"Listened as to the voice of prophecy,"
712,CHAPTER II.,Nursing the pressure which the Prince's hand
713,CHAPTER II.,"Had left in hers, nor cared to understand."
714,CHAPTER II.,
715,CHAPTER II.,"From this day forth, I say, a tender mood"
716,CHAPTER II.,"Possessed them both scarce conscious and unwooed,"
717,CHAPTER II.,"Even in the Prince, her elder and a man."
718,CHAPTER II.,At least Griselda had no thought nor plan
719,CHAPTER II.,Beyond the pleasure of a friendship dear
720,CHAPTER II.,"To all alike, Lord L., the Prince, and her:"
721,CHAPTER II.,"No plan but that the day would be more sweet,"
722,CHAPTER II.,"More full of meaning, if they chanced to meet;"
723,CHAPTER II.,And this chanced every day. The Prince was kind
724,CHAPTER II.,"Beyond all kindness, and Lord L. could find"
725,CHAPTER II.,No words to speak his thanks he thus should be
726,CHAPTER II.,The cicerone of their company.
727,CHAPTER II.,
728,CHAPTER II.,And where a better? Belgirate's lore
729,CHAPTER II.,In all things Roman was in truth a store
730,CHAPTER II.,From which to steal. At her Gamaliel's knees
731,CHAPTER II.,Griselda sat and learned Rome's mysteries
732,CHAPTER II.,With all the zeal of a disciple young
733,CHAPTER II.,And strange to genius and a pleading tongue.
734,CHAPTER II.,"The Prince was eloquent. His theme was high,"
735,CHAPTER II.,"One which had taught less vigorous wings to fly,"
736,CHAPTER II.,"The world of other days, the Pagan Rome,"
737,CHAPTER II.,The scarce less Pagan Rome of Christendom.
738,CHAPTER II.,"On these the Prince spoke warmly much and well,"
739,CHAPTER II.,"Holding Griselda's patient ears in spell,"
740,CHAPTER II.,Yet broke off smiling when he met her eye
741,CHAPTER II.,Fixed on his face in its mute sympathy:
742,CHAPTER II.,"A smile which was a question, an appeal,"
743,CHAPTER II.,And seemed to ask the meaning of her zeal.
744,CHAPTER II.,He did not understand her quite. He saw
745,CHAPTER II.,"Something beyond, unfixed by any law"
746,CHAPTER II.,Of woman's nature his experience knew:
747,CHAPTER II.,He knew not what to hold or hope as true.
748,CHAPTER II.,"For she was young and sad and beautiful,"
749,CHAPTER II.,A very woman with a woman's soul.
750,CHAPTER II.,"She had so strange a pathos in her eyes,"
751,CHAPTER II.,"A tone so deep, such echoes in her voice."
752,CHAPTER II.,What was this Roman Hecuba to her?
753,CHAPTER II.,"This prate of consul, pontiff, emperor?"
754,CHAPTER II.,These broken symbols of forgotten pride?
755,CHAPTER II.,These ashes of old fame by fame denied?
756,CHAPTER II.,"What were these stones to her that she should weep,"
757,CHAPTER II.,Or spend her passion on a cause less deep
758,CHAPTER II.,"Than her own joys and sorrows? Was it love,"
759,CHAPTER II.,Or what thing else had such a power to move?
760,CHAPTER II.,If there was meaning in red lips! And yet
761,CHAPTER II.,'Twere rank impiety to think of it.
762,CHAPTER II.,An Italian woman--yes. But she? Who knew
763,CHAPTER II.,What English virtue dared yet dared not do?
764,CHAPTER II.,
765,CHAPTER II.,This was the thought which lent its mockery
766,CHAPTER II.,"To the more tender omen of his eye,"
767,CHAPTER II.,And checked the pride and chilled the vague desire
768,CHAPTER II.,Her beauty half had kindled into fire.
769,CHAPTER II.,"Yet hope was born and struggled to more life,"
770,CHAPTER II.,"A puny infant with its fears at strife,"
771,CHAPTER II.,"An unacknowledged hidden bastard child,"
772,CHAPTER II.,"Too fair to crush, too wise to be beguiled;"
773,CHAPTER II.,Even Griselda's prudery confessed
774,CHAPTER II.,A star of Bethlehem risen in her East.
775,CHAPTER II.,
776,CHAPTER II.,And thus the winter passed in happiness
777,CHAPTER II.,If not in love. I leave to each to guess
778,CHAPTER II.,"What name 'twere best to give it, for to some"
779,CHAPTER II.,"Who judge such things by simple rule of thumb,"
780,CHAPTER II.,'Twill seem impossible they thus should meet
781,CHAPTER II.,"Day after day in palace, temple, street,"
782,CHAPTER II.,Beneath the sun of heaven or in the shade
783,CHAPTER II.,"Of those old gardens by the cypress made,"
784,CHAPTER II.,Or on their horses drinking in the wind
785,CHAPTER II.,"Of the Campagna, and with care behind,"
786,CHAPTER II.,"Left to take vengeance upon poor Lord L.,"
787,CHAPTER II.,"Some furlongs back a solemn sentinel,"
788,CHAPTER II.,Or in the twilight slowly stealing home
789,CHAPTER II.,"Towards the hundred cupolas of Rome,"
790,CHAPTER II.,To greet the new-born moon and so repeat
791,CHAPTER II.,"Old Tuscan ditties, tender, wise, and sweet,"
792,CHAPTER II.,To the light clatter of their horse-hoof's chime
793,CHAPTER II.,In echoing answer of their terza-rhyme--
794,CHAPTER II.,"'Twill seem, I say, to some impossible"
795,CHAPTER II.,"That all this was not love. Yet, sooth to tell,"
796,CHAPTER II.,"Easter had come and gone, and yet 'twas true"
797,CHAPTER II.,No word of love had passed between the two.
798,CHAPTER II.,
799,CHAPTER II.,"The fact is, after the first halcyon hour"
800,CHAPTER II.,When she had met the Prince and proved his power
801,CHAPTER II.,"To move her inmost soul, Griselda made"
802,CHAPTER II.,"This compact with her heart no less than head,"
803,CHAPTER II.,"Being a woman of much logic sense,"
804,CHAPTER II.,"And knowing all, at least by inference:"
805,CHAPTER II.,"She was resolved that, come what evil might"
806,CHAPTER II.,"On her poor heart, the right should still be right,"
807,CHAPTER II.,"And not a hair's-breadth would she swerve from this,"
808,CHAPTER II.,Though it should cost her soul its happiness.
809,CHAPTER II.,"She would not trifle longer, nor provide"
810,CHAPTER II.,"The Prince with pretext for his further pride,"
811,CHAPTER II.,Or grant more favour than a friendship given
812,CHAPTER II.,"Once and for all, in this world as in heaven."
813,CHAPTER II.,"This she indeed could offer, but, if more"
814,CHAPTER II.,"Were asked, why then, alas! her dream was o'er."
815,CHAPTER II.,I think no actual covenant had passed
816,CHAPTER II.,"In words between them either first or last,"
817,CHAPTER II.,"But that the Prince, though puzzled and perplexed,"
818,CHAPTER II.,"Had drawn a just conclusion from his text,"
819,CHAPTER II.,"And read her meaning, while the hazard made,"
820,CHAPTER II.,"Of certain idle words at random said,"
821,CHAPTER II.,"Had sapped his confidence, and served to show"
822,CHAPTER II.,"If speech were wise, 'twas wiser to forego."
823,CHAPTER II.,
824,CHAPTER II.,Once too he wrote a sonnet. They had spent
825,CHAPTER II.,An afternoon (it was in early Lent)
826,CHAPTER II.,At that fair angle of the city wall
827,CHAPTER II.,"Which is the English place of burial,"
828,CHAPTER II.,"A poet's pilgrimage to Shelley's tomb,--"
829,CHAPTER II.,"The holiest spot, Griselda thought, in Rome,--"
830,CHAPTER II.,"A place to worship in, perhaps to pray,"
831,CHAPTER II.,At least to meditate and spend the day.
832,CHAPTER II.,
833,CHAPTER II.,She had brought her friend with her. She had at heart
834,CHAPTER II.,To win his homage for the unknown art
835,CHAPTER II.,"Of this dead alien priest of Italy,"
836,CHAPTER II.,"This lover of the earth, and sea, and sky;"
837,CHAPTER II.,"And, reading there and talking in that mood"
838,CHAPTER II.,Which comes of happiness and youthful blood
839,CHAPTER II.,"So near akin to sorrow, their discourse"
840,CHAPTER II.,Had touched on human change and pain's remorse
841,CHAPTER II.,Amid the eternal greenness of the spring;
842,CHAPTER II.,"And, when they came to part, there had seemed to ring"
843,CHAPTER II.,"A note of trouble in Griselda's voice,"
844,CHAPTER II.,"A sigh as if in grief for human joys,"
845,CHAPTER II.,"An echo of unspoken tenderness,"
846,CHAPTER II.,Which caused the Prince to hold her hand in his
847,CHAPTER II.,"One little moment longer than was right,"
848,CHAPTER II.,When they had shaken hands and bid good night.
849,CHAPTER II.,
850,CHAPTER II.,And so he wrote that evening on the spur
851,CHAPTER II.,Of the first tender impulse of the hour
852,CHAPTER II.,"A sonnet to Griselda, a farewell"
853,CHAPTER II.,"It seemed to be, yet also an appeal--"
854,CHAPTER II.,Perhaps a declaration; who shall say
855,CHAPTER II.,"Whether the thought which lightened into day,"
856,CHAPTER II.,"Between the sorrowing accents of each line,"
857,CHAPTER II.,Was more despair or hope which asked a sign?
858,CHAPTER II.,
859,CHAPTER II.,"""Farewell,"" it said, ""although nor seas divide"
860,CHAPTER II.,"Nor kingdoms separate, but a single street,"
861,CHAPTER II.,"The sole sad gap between us, scarce too wide"
862,CHAPTER II.,"For hands to cross, and though we needs must meet"
863,CHAPTER II.,"Not in a year, a month, but just to-morrow,"
864,CHAPTER II.,When the first happy instinct of our feet
865,CHAPTER II.,"Bears us together,--yet we part in sorrow,"
866,CHAPTER II.,"Bidding good-bye, as though we would repeat"
867,CHAPTER II.,Good-byes for ever. There are gulfs that yawn
868,CHAPTER II.,"Between us wide with time and circumstance,"
869,CHAPTER II.,Deep as the gulf which lies 'twixt dead and dead.
870,CHAPTER II.,The day of promise finds no second dawn:
871,CHAPTER II.,"See, while I speak, the pressure of our hands"
872,CHAPTER II.,"Fades slowly from remembrance, and is fled,"
873,CHAPTER II.,"And our weak hearts accept their fate. Nay, nay,"
874,CHAPTER II.,"We meet again, but never as to-day."""
875,CHAPTER II.,
876,CHAPTER II.,To this Griselda answered nothing. She
877,CHAPTER II.,"Was pleased, yet disconcerted. Poetry"
878,CHAPTER II.,"Is always pleasant to a woman's ear,"
879,CHAPTER II.,"And to Griselda had been doubly dear,"
880,CHAPTER II.,If it had touched less nearly. But her heart
881,CHAPTER II.,Had bounded with too violent a start
882,CHAPTER II.,"To leave her certain of her self-control,"
883,CHAPTER II.,In this new joy which seemed to probe her soul.
884,CHAPTER II.,And feeling frightened she had tried to find
885,CHAPTER II.,A reason for the tumult of her mind
886,CHAPTER II.,In being angry. He should not have dared
887,CHAPTER II.,To strike so near the truth. Or had she bared
888,CHAPTER II.,Her soul so plain to his that he should speak
889,CHAPTER II.,Of both as an eye-witness? She felt weak
890,CHAPTER II.,"And out of temper with herself and him,"
891,CHAPTER II.,And with the sudden waking from a dream
892,CHAPTER II.,"Too long indulged, and with her own sad fate,"
893,CHAPTER II.,Which made all dreams a crime against the State.
894,CHAPTER II.,There yawned indeed a gulf between them. This
895,CHAPTER II.,It needed no such word as had been his
896,CHAPTER II.,To bring back to her memory or show
897,CHAPTER II.,"How wide it was, and deep, and far below;"
898,CHAPTER II.,"And yet she shuddered, for already thought"
899,CHAPTER II.,Had led her to the brink where reason fought
900,CHAPTER II.,"With folly, and conjured it to look down"
901,CHAPTER II.,Into the vast and terrible unknown.
902,CHAPTER II.,This was itself an omen.
903,CHAPTER II.,
904,CHAPTER II.,All that day
905,CHAPTER II.,"Griselda had a headache, and said nay"
906,CHAPTER II.,"To those who called, the Prince among the rest,"
907,CHAPTER II.,Who came distrusting and returned distressed.
908,CHAPTER II.,"Awhile this humour lasted. Then they met,"
909,CHAPTER II.,"And Belgirate, venturing a regret"
910,CHAPTER II.,"For having vexed her with so poor a rhyme,"
911,CHAPTER II.,Griselda had protested want of time
912,CHAPTER II.,And want of talent as her sole excuse
913,CHAPTER II.,"For having made no answer to his Muse,"
914,CHAPTER II.,Yet cast withal a look so pitiful
915,CHAPTER II.,Upon his face it moved his very soul.
916,CHAPTER II.,This closed the incident. He might have spoken
917,CHAPTER II.,"Perhaps that instant, and received some token"
918,CHAPTER II.,Of more than a forgiveness. But his fate
919,CHAPTER II.,Had willed it otherwise or willed too late.
920,CHAPTER II.,"For love forgives not, plead it as we may"
921,CHAPTER II.,"To speak the unspoken ""Yes"" of yesterday."
922,CHAPTER II.,
923,CHAPTER II.,
924,CHAPTER II.,
925,CHAPTER II.,
926,CHAPTER III.,CHAPTER III.
927,CHAPTER III.,
928,CHAPTER III.,
929,CHAPTER III.,"Who has not seen the falls of Tivoli,"
930,CHAPTER III.,"The rocks, the foam-white water, and the three"
931,CHAPTER III.,Fair ruined temples which adorn the hill?
932,CHAPTER III.,Who has not sat and listened to the shrill
933,CHAPTER III.,"Sweet melody of blackbirds, and the roar"
934,CHAPTER III.,"Of Anio's voice rebounding from the shore,"
935,CHAPTER III.,Nor would have given his very soul to greet
936,CHAPTER III.,"Some passing vision of a white nymph's feet,"
937,CHAPTER III.,"And weaving arms, as the wild chasm's spray"
938,CHAPTER III.,"Beat on his face, for ever answering ""Nay?"""
939,CHAPTER III.,"Who has not turned away with sadder face,"
940,CHAPTER III.,"Abashed before the genius of the place,"
941,CHAPTER III.,"A wiser man, and owned upon his knees,"
942,CHAPTER III.,The dull transmontane Goth and boor he is?
943,CHAPTER III.,Who that was born to feel?
944,CHAPTER III.,
945,CHAPTER III.,What sons of clay
946,CHAPTER III.,"Are these that stand among your shrines to-day,"
947,CHAPTER III.,Gods of the ancient rivers! and who set
948,CHAPTER III.,The heavy impress of barbarian feet
949,CHAPTER III.,"Upon your classic shores, and dare to love"
950,CHAPTER III.,"Your ruined homes in temple, rock, and grove!"
951,CHAPTER III.,"What new rude sons of Japhet! What mad crew,"
952,CHAPTER III.,Whose only creed is what it dares to do
953,CHAPTER III.,"Through lack of knowledge, whose undoubting heart,"
954,CHAPTER III.,"Here in the very temples of old art,"
955,CHAPTER III.,"Brings out its little tribute, builds its shrines,"
956,CHAPTER III.,"Wreathes its sad garlands of untutored lines,"
957,CHAPTER III.,"Writes, paints, professes, sculptures its new gods,"
958,CHAPTER III.,And dares to have its home in your abodes!
959,CHAPTER III.,
960,CHAPTER III.,"Oh, if I had a soul oppressed with song,"
961,CHAPTER III.,A tongue on fire to prophesy among
962,CHAPTER III.,"My brother prophets, if I had a hand"
963,CHAPTER III.,Which needs must write its legend on life's sand
964,CHAPTER III.,"With brush or chisel, I at least would choose"
965,CHAPTER III.,"Some soil less fair, less sacred to the Muse,"
966,CHAPTER III.,"Some younger, wilder land, where no sad voice"
967,CHAPTER III.,"Had ever stammered forth its tale of joys,"
968,CHAPTER III.,"And loves and sorrows, or in tones less rude"
969,CHAPTER III.,Than the brute pulsing of its human blood;
970,CHAPTER III.,"If I would build a temple, it should be"
971,CHAPTER III.,"At least not here, not here in Italy,"
972,CHAPTER III.,Where all these temples stand. My thought should shape
973,CHAPTER III.,Its fancies in rough granite on some cape
974,CHAPTER III.,"O'erlooking the Atlantic, from whose foam"
975,CHAPTER III.,"No goddess ever leaped, and not in Rome,"
976,CHAPTER III.,"Beneath the mockery of immortal eyes,"
977,CHAPTER III.,"Gazing in marble down, so coldly wise!"
978,CHAPTER III.,
979,CHAPTER III.,"Such was Griselda's thought, which, half aloud,"
980,CHAPTER III.,She uttered one May morning 'mid a crowd
981,CHAPTER III.,"Of pleasure-seekers, come from Rome to see"
982,CHAPTER III.,"The wonder of these falls of Tivoli,"
983,CHAPTER III.,"And Belgirate's villa, where the Prince"
984,CHAPTER III.,"Was offering entertainment (for his sins),"
985,CHAPTER III.,And dancing to all such as called him friend
986,CHAPTER III.,"That Spring in Rome, now nearly at an end;--"
987,CHAPTER III.,A thought suggested by the place and by
988,CHAPTER III.,"A German painter, who undauntedly"
989,CHAPTER III.,"Was plying a huge canvas just begun,"
990,CHAPTER III.,With brush and palette seated in the sun.
991,CHAPTER III.,"She had hardly meant to speak, and when Lord L."
992,CHAPTER III.,Objected (for he knew his classics well)
993,CHAPTER III.,That landscape-painting was an unknown trade
994,CHAPTER III.,"In the days of Horace, blushed for her tirade,"
995,CHAPTER III.,"And turned to Belgirate, who stood near,"
996,CHAPTER III.,Playing the host to all the world and her.
997,CHAPTER III.,
998,CHAPTER III.,"The Prince appealed to, though his care was less"
999,CHAPTER III.,"With what was spoken than the speaker's face,"
1000,CHAPTER III.,"Took up the parable, confessed the truth"
1001,CHAPTER III.,"Of all each ventured, and agreed with both."
1002,CHAPTER III.,"Nature, he said, and art, though now allied,"
1003,CHAPTER III.,Had not in all times thus walked side by side.
1004,CHAPTER III.,"Indeed the love of Nature, now so real,"
1005,CHAPTER III.,"Was alien to the love of the ideal,"
1006,CHAPTER III.,The classic love which claimed as though of need
1007,CHAPTER III.,"Some living presence for each fountain-head,"
1008,CHAPTER III.,"Each grove, each cavern, satyr, nymph, or god,"
1009,CHAPTER III.,A human shape unseen yet understood.
1010,CHAPTER III.,"This was the thought which lived in ancient art,"
1011,CHAPTER III.,"Eschewing the waste places of the heart,"
1012,CHAPTER III.,And only on compulsion brought to face
1013,CHAPTER III.,Brute Nature's aspect in its nakedness.
1014,CHAPTER III.,Nature as Nature was a thought too rude
1015,CHAPTER III.,"For these, untempered in its solitude."
1016,CHAPTER III.,It had no counterpart in our new love
1017,CHAPTER III.,"Of mountain, sea and forest. Then, each grove"
1018,CHAPTER III.,"Asked for its statue, each perennial spring"
1019,CHAPTER III.,Its fountain. Solitude itself must bring
1020,CHAPTER III.,Its echo. Every mountain top of Greece
1021,CHAPTER III.,Beheld fair temples rise. A law of peace
1022,CHAPTER III.,Reigned over art in protest at the mood
1023,CHAPTER III.,Of social life which drenched the world in blood.
1024,CHAPTER III.,All now had been reversed. Our modern creed
1025,CHAPTER III.,Scouted the law that men were born to bleed.
1026,CHAPTER III.,"It turned from human nature, if untaught,"
1027,CHAPTER III.,"And wrought mankind, perhaps and overwrought"
1028,CHAPTER III.,"Into trim shapes, and then for its relief"
1029,CHAPTER III.,Rushed to the wilderness to vent its grief
1030,CHAPTER III.,In lonely passion. Here it neither sought
1031,CHAPTER III.,Nor found a presence which it needed not.
1032,CHAPTER III.,It chose wild hills and barren seas. It saw
1033,CHAPTER III.,"Beauty in tumult, in revolt a law."
1034,CHAPTER III.,Here it gave reins to its brute instincts. Here
1035,CHAPTER III.,"It owned no god, no guide, no arbiter."
1036,CHAPTER III.,"Its soul it must avenge of discipline,"
1037,CHAPTER III.,And Nature had gone naked from the shrine.
1038,CHAPTER III.,This was its consolation.
1039,CHAPTER III.,
1040,CHAPTER III.,Of the score
1041,CHAPTER III.,"Who stood around him and who praised his lore,"
1042,CHAPTER III.,Perhaps no single listener understood
1043,CHAPTER III.,"The thought which underlay the Prince's mood,"
1044,CHAPTER III.,Or guessed its bitterness--not even she
1045,CHAPTER III.,Who lent the moral to his mockery.
1046,CHAPTER III.,Yet she was moved. In her too was a need
1047,CHAPTER III.,"Of consolation for too fair a creed,"
1048,CHAPTER III.,An impulse of rebellion. In her blood
1049,CHAPTER III.,"There lived a germ of Nature unsubdued,"
1050,CHAPTER III.,Which would not be appeased. She too had sought
1051,CHAPTER III.,A refuge from the tyranny of thought
1052,CHAPTER III.,In the brute impulses of sea and plain
1053,CHAPTER III.,And cloud and forest far from haunts of men.
1054,CHAPTER III.,A vain mad search. The fetters of her pride
1055,CHAPTER III.,Galled her like sores. Griselda turned and sighed.
1056,CHAPTER III.,
1057,CHAPTER III.,"That evening on the terrace, vaguely lit"
1058,CHAPTER III.,With paper lanterns and the infinite
1059,CHAPTER III.,"Display of those fair natural lamps, the stars,"
1060,CHAPTER III.,And 'neath the influence of the planet Mars
1061,CHAPTER III.,Or Venus or another--which it was
1062,CHAPTER III.,We best may judge by that which came to pass--
1063,CHAPTER III.,The Prince essayed his fortune.
1064,CHAPTER III.,
1065,CHAPTER III.,From the hour
1066,CHAPTER III.,"Of their first flash of eloquence, some power,"
1067,CHAPTER III.,Some most persistent and ingenious fate
1068,CHAPTER III.,"Of idle tongues had held them separate,"
1069,CHAPTER III.,Griselda and the Prince--him in his part
1070,CHAPTER III.,"Of host, with cares not wholly of the heart"
1071,CHAPTER III.,"Demanding his attention, while on her"
1072,CHAPTER III.,Friends fastened more than dull and less than dear.
1073,CHAPTER III.,"In vain they stopped, and loitered, and went on,"
1074,CHAPTER III.,"Leaving no trick untried, unturned no stone;"
1075,CHAPTER III.,In vain they waited. Still their hope deferred
1076,CHAPTER III.,"Failed of its object, one consoling word,"
1077,CHAPTER III.,One little sigh as of relief thus given:
1078,CHAPTER III.,"""Well, they are gone at last, and thanked be Heaven."""
1079,CHAPTER III.,"But hour on hour went by, and accident"
1080,CHAPTER III.,"Seemed still at pains to frustrate their intent,"
1081,CHAPTER III.,"Piling up grief for them and poor Lord L.,"
1082,CHAPTER III.,"On whom, in fault of foes, their vengeance fell."
1083,CHAPTER III.,"'Twas worst for her. She knew not whom to strike,"
1084,CHAPTER III.,"Lord L., her friends, the Prince--'twas now alike."
1085,CHAPTER III.,"She had lost in fact her temper, if I dare"
1086,CHAPTER III.,"Thus speak of one so wise and one so fair,"
1087,CHAPTER III.,And to the point that now there was no room
1088,CHAPTER III.,"For other thought, but L. should take her home,"
1089,CHAPTER III.,Away and speedily.
1090,CHAPTER III.,
1091,CHAPTER III.,"The Prince, who knew"
1092,CHAPTER III.,"No word of what a storm Fate held in brew,"
1093,CHAPTER III.,"And who had sought, in innocence of all,"
1094,CHAPTER III.,"Griselda's hand to lead the opening ball,"
1095,CHAPTER III.,"And sought in vain, now found, to his despair,"
1096,CHAPTER III.,My lady cloaked and standing on the stair.
1097,CHAPTER III.,"She was alone. ""Lord L. had gone,"" she said,"
1098,CHAPTER III.,"""To bid the Prince good night. Her foolish head"
1099,CHAPTER III.,"Had played her false, and ached with the new heat"
1100,CHAPTER III.,Of the May sun (even L. complained of it).
1101,CHAPTER III.,"They must be home betimes. Next day was Sunday,"
1102,CHAPTER III.,"And they had much to do 'twixt that and Monday,"
1103,CHAPTER III.,"In view of their departure."" ""Whither? whence?"
1104,CHAPTER III.,"In Heaven's name,"" exclaimed the astounded Prince."
1105,CHAPTER III.,"""Why, home to England, she had thought he knew:"
1106,CHAPTER III.,She must have told him. L. was more than due
1107,CHAPTER III.,"In London, where his place in Parliament"
1108,CHAPTER III.,"Required his presence. He had missed the Lent,"
1109,CHAPTER III.,And dared not miss the Easter session. She
1110,CHAPTER III.,"Thought he was right, altho',""--and suddenly"
1111,CHAPTER III.,"She burst in tears. The Prince, in dire distress,"
1112,CHAPTER III.,"Besought her to be calm. But she, with face"
1113,CHAPTER III.,"Hid in both hands, and turning from the light,"
1114,CHAPTER III.,"Broke from his arms, and rushed into the night."
1115,CHAPTER III.,"Across the hall, beneath the portico,"
1116,CHAPTER III.,"And down the steps she fled, to where below"
1117,CHAPTER III.,"The garden lay all dim with starlit shade,"
1118,CHAPTER III.,And the white glimmer of the main façade.
1119,CHAPTER III.,"Here Belgirate found her on a seat,"
1120,CHAPTER III.,"Crouched in an angle of the parapet,"
1121,CHAPTER III.,And sobbing as in terror. His surprise
1122,CHAPTER III.,Was changed to resolution. To his eyes
1123,CHAPTER III.,"The world became transfigured. ""Lady L.,"""
1124,CHAPTER III.,"He whispered, ""what is this? You love me? Well,"
1125,CHAPTER III.,"Why do you weep?"""
1126,CHAPTER III.,
1127,CHAPTER III.,He took her hands in his
1128,CHAPTER III.,And pressed them to his lips; and at the kiss
1129,CHAPTER III.,Griselda started from the heap she was
1130,CHAPTER III.,"And sat upright, with pale pathetic face"
1131,CHAPTER III.,Turned to the night. By the dim starlight he
1132,CHAPTER III.,"Beheld, half-awed and half in ecstasy,"
1133,CHAPTER III.,The strange emotion of her countenance.
1134,CHAPTER III.,"She made no gesture to withdraw her hands,"
1135,CHAPTER III.,No sign of disagreement with his words.
1136,CHAPTER III.,Her eyes looked scared and troubled like a bird's
1137,CHAPTER III.,"Caught in a net, and seemed to ask of Fate"
1138,CHAPTER III.,Where the next blow should fall. 'Twas thus she sat
1139,CHAPTER III.,"Speechless, inanimate, nor seemed to breathe."
1140,CHAPTER III.,"The Prince could hear the chattering of her teeth,"
1141,CHAPTER III.,"And feel her shiver in the warm night wind,--"
1142,CHAPTER III.,And yet its touch was hardly thus unkind.
1143,CHAPTER III.,
1144,CHAPTER III.,"He too, poor soul, in hope and tenderness,"
1145,CHAPTER III.,"Still kissed her hands, and kissed her gloves and dress,"
1146,CHAPTER III.,And kneeling at her feet embraced her knees
1147,CHAPTER III.,With soothing arms and soft cajoleries.
1148,CHAPTER III.,She dared not turn nor speak. The balustrade
1149,CHAPTER III.,Served as a pretext for her with its shade
1150,CHAPTER III.,Hiding his face. She would not seem to guess
1151,CHAPTER III.,All that his fondness asked of her distress:
1152,CHAPTER III.,A word might break the spell. She only knew
1153,CHAPTER III.,"She was a poor sad woman, doomed to do"
1154,CHAPTER III.,"Sorrow to all who loved her, that the Prince"
1155,CHAPTER III.,"Had spoken truly, and her long pretence"
1156,CHAPTER III.,Of innocence was o'er. She scorned to make
1157,CHAPTER III.,An idle protest now for honour's sake.
1158,CHAPTER III.,He had a right to ask for what he would
1159,CHAPTER III.,"Now that she loved him, and her womanhood"
1160,CHAPTER III.,"Reserved one tearful right, and only one,"
1161,CHAPTER III.,To hide her face an instant and be gone.
1162,CHAPTER III.,
1163,CHAPTER III.,How long they sat thus silent who shall say?
1164,CHAPTER III.,Griselda knew not. Time was far away;
1165,CHAPTER III.,She wanted courage to prepare her heart
1166,CHAPTER III.,"For that last bitterest word of all, ""We part;"""
1167,CHAPTER III.,"And he cared naught for time: his heaven was there,"
1168,CHAPTER III.,"Nor needed thought, nor speech, nor even prayer."
1169,CHAPTER III.,
1170,CHAPTER III.,A sound of music roused them. From the house
1171,CHAPTER III.,"Voices broke in and strains tumultuous,"
1172,CHAPTER III.,Proving the dance begun. Then with a sigh
1173,CHAPTER III.,"Griselda turned her head, and piteously"
1174,CHAPTER III.,"Looked in his face. She moved as if to go,"
1175,CHAPTER III.,"And when he held her still, ""For pity, no,"
1176,CHAPTER III.,"Let me be gone,"" she cried. ""I ask it thus,"""
1177,CHAPTER III.,"Clasping her hands. ""You will not? No! alas!"
1178,CHAPTER III.,You must not doubt me when I speak the truth;
1179,CHAPTER III.,"This is a great misfortune for us both."""
1180,CHAPTER III.,"""Griselda,"" he began. ""Oh, stop,"" she said,"
1181,CHAPTER III.,"""You know not what you ask."" She bent her head"
1182,CHAPTER III.,"Close to his own. ""I am not what I seem,"
1183,CHAPTER III.,"A woman to be loved, not even by him"
1184,CHAPTER III.,Whom I might choose to worship. Mine must be
1185,CHAPTER III.,"An unfinished life, not quite a tragedy,"
1186,CHAPTER III.,"Even to my friends, an idle aimless life,"
1187,CHAPTER III.,"Not worth an argument, still less a strife."
1188,CHAPTER III.,"You must forget, forgive me. We were friends,"
1189,CHAPTER III.,"Friends still perhaps; but, oh! this first day ends"
1190,CHAPTER III.,"Our love for ever. What you said was true,"
1191,CHAPTER III.,"Only I never guessed it."""
1192,CHAPTER III.,
1193,CHAPTER III.,The Prince knew
1194,CHAPTER III.,"That she was weeping, and a single sob"
1195,CHAPTER III.,Broke from her lips. She seemed her wounds to probe.
1196,CHAPTER III.,"""Yes, I have loved you, loved you from the first,"
1197,CHAPTER III.,"The day we met at Terni, when you burst"
1198,CHAPTER III.,Like sunshine on the storm of my dark life--
1199,CHAPTER III.,"You, wise and free--I, only the sad wife"
1200,CHAPTER III.,Of one you called a friend. The fault was mine
1201,CHAPTER III.,And mine alone. In you there was no sin:
1202,CHAPTER III.,"You stood too far from me, too high above"
1203,CHAPTER III.,My woman's follies even to dream of love.
1204,CHAPTER III.,"There, do not answer. You were kind to me,"
1205,CHAPTER III.,"Good, patient, wise--you could no other be--"
1206,CHAPTER III.,"But, oh! you never loved me."""
1207,CHAPTER III.,
1208,CHAPTER III.,Here again
1209,CHAPTER III.,The Prince broke in protesting (but in vain):
1210,CHAPTER III.,Her words were madness and his heart was hers.
1211,CHAPTER III.,She would not listen nor control her tears--
1212,CHAPTER III.,"""You never loved me. This one thought I hold"
1213,CHAPTER III.,In consolation of my manifold
1214,CHAPTER III.,Deceits and errors. You at least are free
1215,CHAPTER III.,From all deceptions and remorse and me:--
1216,CHAPTER III.,"I cannot cause you sorrow, else it were"
1217,CHAPTER III.,"Indeed too pitiful, too hard to bear."""
1218,CHAPTER III.,
1219,CHAPTER III.,"She stooped and kissed his forehead reverently,"
1220,CHAPTER III.,As one would kiss a relic; and when he
1221,CHAPTER III.,"Still would have spoken, stopped him with a hand"
1222,CHAPTER III.,"Laid on his lips, half-prayer and half-command."
1223,CHAPTER III.,"She would not let him speak. The prince, tho' mute,"
1224,CHAPTER III.,Now pleaded with his hands and pressed his suit
1225,CHAPTER III.,"With better eloquence, for this to her"
1226,CHAPTER III.,Seemed less a crime than speech. Her ignorant fear
1227,CHAPTER III.,Had hardly fathomed yet the troubled sea
1228,CHAPTER III.,On which her lot was cast thus dangerously.
1229,CHAPTER III.,She only feared his words to prove him right;
1230,CHAPTER III.,And these caresses in the dim still night
1231,CHAPTER III.,"Soothed and consoled her. They were too unreal,"
1232,CHAPTER III.,"Too strange to her experience, quite to feel"
1233,CHAPTER III.,"Or quite to question. She, with half-shut eyes,"
1234,CHAPTER III.,"And face averted, ceased to feel surprise,"
1235,CHAPTER III.,"And ceased to think. She was a child again,"
1236,CHAPTER III.,"Caressed and fondled. She forgot her pain,"
1237,CHAPTER III.,And almost even his presence in the place.
1238,CHAPTER III.,He was too near and could not see her face.
1239,CHAPTER III.,"Besides, Griselda loved him. Only once"
1240,CHAPTER III.,"She made a silent protest with her hands,"
1241,CHAPTER III.,"As one might make asleep, and in her dream"
1242,CHAPTER III.,"Opened her eyes, and seemed to question him"
1243,CHAPTER III.,With the pathetic instinct as of doom.
1244,CHAPTER III.,The Prince in rapture judged his hour was come.
1245,CHAPTER III.,
1246,CHAPTER III.,"Alas! poor Prince. If thou hadst had thy bliss,"
1247,CHAPTER III.,"I would not then have grudged thy happiness,"
1248,CHAPTER III.,Thine nor Griselda's. Happiness is not
1249,CHAPTER III.,A merchandise men buy or leave unbought
1250,CHAPTER III.,And find again. It is a wild bird winging
1251,CHAPTER III.,"Its way through heaven, in joyous circles ringing,"
1252,CHAPTER III.,"Aloft, at its own will. Then, e'er we wist,"
1253,CHAPTER III.,"It stooped and sat a moment on our wrist,"
1254,CHAPTER III.,"And fondled with our fingers, and made play"
1255,CHAPTER III.,With jess and hood as if it meant to stay.
1256,CHAPTER III.,"And we, if we were wise and fortunate,"
1257,CHAPTER III.,"And if the hour had been decreed of fate,"
1258,CHAPTER III.,"Seized the glad bird and held it in our hand,"
1259,CHAPTER III.,"And forced it to obey our least command,"
1260,CHAPTER III.,"Knowing that never more, if not made sure,"
1261,CHAPTER III.,"It would come again to voice, or sign, or lure."
1262,CHAPTER III.,
1263,CHAPTER III.,"Oh, such is happiness. That night for them"
1264,CHAPTER III.,"Fate stood, a genius, suppliant and tame,"
1265,CHAPTER III.,"Demanding to do service. Had they willed,"
1266,CHAPTER III.,The treasure-house of heaven had been unfilled
1267,CHAPTER III.,"And emptied in their lap. They too, even they,"
1268,CHAPTER III.,"Mere mortals born, inheritors of clay,"
1269,CHAPTER III.,"Had known eternal life, and been as gods,"
1270,CHAPTER III.,"Only the will between them was at odds,"
1271,CHAPTER III.,Only the word was wanting.
1272,CHAPTER III.,
1273,CHAPTER III.,What one thing
1274,CHAPTER III.,"It was that frightened Fate to taking wing,"
1275,CHAPTER III.,"And scared for ever the celestial bird,"
1276,CHAPTER III.,"And left them desolate, if I have heard"
1277,CHAPTER III.,"I do not now remember, nor would say"
1278,CHAPTER III.,Even if I knew. 'Twas told me not to-day
1279,CHAPTER III.,"Nor yesterday, but in a time long since,"
1280,CHAPTER III.,"By one of the two who knew, in confidence,"
1281,CHAPTER III.,And then not quite perhaps the utter truth--
1282,CHAPTER III.,Whoever tells it? But there came to both
1283,CHAPTER III.,"A moment when, as Belgirate knew,"
1284,CHAPTER III.,There was no further power to plead or sue:
1285,CHAPTER III.,They had played with Fate too long. Their hour was over;
1286,CHAPTER III.,She was no more his love nor he her lover.
1287,CHAPTER III.,His courage was exhausted. One by one
1288,CHAPTER III.,"His fingers, which still held Griselda's gown,"
1289,CHAPTER III.,"Relaxed their hold. His hands dropped by his side,"
1290,CHAPTER III.,"His head upon his bosom, and the pride,"
1291,CHAPTER III.,"Which was the reason of his being, quailed."
1292,CHAPTER III.,"Grief in that hour and tenderness prevailed,"
1293,CHAPTER III.,"And tears rushed to his eyes, long strangers there,"
1294,CHAPTER III.,"And to his lips, Italian-like, a prayer,"
1295,CHAPTER III.,"While he lay prostrate, his face turned from heaven,"
1296,CHAPTER III.,Under the stars.
1297,CHAPTER III.,
1298,CHAPTER III.,The tower clock struck eleven
1299,CHAPTER III.,And roused him. He had neither heard nor known
1300,CHAPTER III.,"Griselda's going, but he was alone."
1301,CHAPTER III.,
1302,CHAPTER III.,*       *       *       *       *
1303,CHAPTER III.,
1304,CHAPTER III.,"And she? Griselda? In a whirl of grief,"
1305,CHAPTER III.,"Tortured, distracted, hopeless of relief,"
1306,CHAPTER III.,"And careless now what eye should see her tears,"
1307,CHAPTER III.,"Whom none could mock with bitterer jibes than hers,"
1308,CHAPTER III.,"And speechless to all question of her lord,"
1309,CHAPTER III.,"Who sought to learn what portent had occurred,"
1310,CHAPTER III.,And still reverted to the theme begun
1311,CHAPTER III.,Of Roman fever and the Roman sun;
1312,CHAPTER III.,She was driven back to Rome. Two days her door
1313,CHAPTER III.,"Was shut to all the world, both rich and poor,"
1314,CHAPTER III.,"And on the third she went to Ostia,"
1315,CHAPTER III.,Pleading a wild desire to see the sea.
1316,CHAPTER III.,
1317,CHAPTER III.,The sea! What virtue is there in the sea
1318,CHAPTER III.,That it consoles us thus in misery?
1319,CHAPTER III.,"In joy we do not love it, and our bliss"
1320,CHAPTER III.,Scoffs at its tears and scorns its barrenness.
1321,CHAPTER III.,"Our pride of life is in the fruitful Earth,"
1322,CHAPTER III.,"The mother of all joy, which gave us birth,"
1323,CHAPTER III.,"The Earth so touching in its hopes to be,"
1324,CHAPTER III.,"So green, so tender in its sympathy."
1325,CHAPTER III.,"But when life turns to bitterness--ah! then,"
1326,CHAPTER III.,Where is Earth's message to the sons of men?
1327,CHAPTER III.,How does she speak? What sound of grief is hers
1328,CHAPTER III.,To match our grief? What tale of pity stirs
1329,CHAPTER III.,Her jubilant heart? The laughing woods give back
1330,CHAPTER III.,Naught of their happiness to those who lack.
1331,CHAPTER III.,"The beauty of the uplands bars relief,"
1332,CHAPTER III.,The prosperous fields are insolent to grief;
1333,CHAPTER III.,"There is no comfort in the lowing herds,"
1334,CHAPTER III.,"The hum of bees, the songs, the shouts of birds;"
1335,CHAPTER III.,"There is no sob in all the living earth,"
1336,CHAPTER III.,"Naught but the flutter of discordant mirth,"
1337,CHAPTER III.,"On which, as on a pageant, morn and even"
1338,CHAPTER III.,The careless sun shines mockingly from heaven.
1339,CHAPTER III.,"There is no grief in all the world save one,"
1340,CHAPTER III.,"The ocean's voice, as tearful as our own."
1341,CHAPTER III.,"Then from the Earth we turn--too potent mother,"
1342,CHAPTER III.,"Too joyous in her offspring--to that other,"
1343,CHAPTER III.,"The childless, joyless, unproductive Sea,"
1344,CHAPTER III.,And mourn with her her dread virginity.
1345,CHAPTER III.,"We clasp her naked rocks with our two hands,"
1346,CHAPTER III.,"Barefoot we tread her barren waste of sands,"
1347,CHAPTER III.,"Her breadths of shingle and her treeless shore,"
1348,CHAPTER III.,"Knowing her griefs are as our griefs, and more,"
1349,CHAPTER III.,An eternal lack of love.
1350,CHAPTER III.,
1351,CHAPTER III.,'Twas in this guise
1352,CHAPTER III.,"Griselda cradled her soul's miseries,"
1353,CHAPTER III.,"And nursed it in its anguish like a child,"
1354,CHAPTER III.,And soothed it to oblivion. The sea smiled
1355,CHAPTER III.,"With its eternal smile upon her sorrow,"
1356,CHAPTER III.,"The selfsame yesterday, to-day, to-morrow,"
1357,CHAPTER III.,"And kept its tears in its own bosom sealed,"
1358,CHAPTER III.,"A mystery of passion unrevealed,"
1359,CHAPTER III.,"Save in the tremor of its voice at noon,"
1360,CHAPTER III.,When the wind rose and played wild chords thereon.
1361,CHAPTER III.,So she.
1362,CHAPTER III.,
1363,CHAPTER III.,The memory of that place long stood
1364,CHAPTER III.,"In her remembrance as a dream of good,"
1365,CHAPTER III.,"Dividing life as sleep divides the day,"
1366,CHAPTER III.,A place of utter weakness. Let those say
1367,CHAPTER III.,"Who will, that deeds of strength life's milestones are."
1368,CHAPTER III.,"The dearest days are not the days of war,"
1369,CHAPTER III.,And victory is forgotten in the peace
1370,CHAPTER III.,"Of certain hours gone by in helplessness,"
1371,CHAPTER III.,"When the soul ceased to battle, and lay still"
1372,CHAPTER III.,As on a deathbed dumb to good and ill.
1373,CHAPTER III.,These are its treasures.
1374,CHAPTER III.,
1375,CHAPTER III.,Nor was silence all
1376,CHAPTER III.,"Griselda's ointment. Hard by the sea-wall,"
1377,CHAPTER III.,"Where daily her steps turned fresh peace to find,"
1378,CHAPTER III.,"A convent stood, inviting to the mind."
1379,CHAPTER III.,"Here she found entrance at the chapel gate,"
1380,CHAPTER III.,"And knelt in prayer half-inarticulate,"
1381,CHAPTER III.,Bowed to the earth. For patron saints it had
1382,CHAPTER III.,"The Marys three--""two virtuous, and one bad,"""
1383,CHAPTER III.,"Griselda thought, ""like her own self""--who came"
1384,CHAPTER III.,"In flight together from Jerusalem,"
1385,CHAPTER III.,"And landed there; and these in her great need,"
1386,CHAPTER III.,"She suppliant asked for her soul's daily bread,"
1387,CHAPTER III.,"Using all fondest words her lips could frame,"
1388,CHAPTER III.,To speak her secret wishes without blame.
1389,CHAPTER III.,"Six candlesticks she vowed, to each a pair,"
1390,CHAPTER III.,So they would listen to and grant her prayer.
1391,CHAPTER III.,The superstition pleased her. In her pride
1392,CHAPTER III.,"She bowed and begged like any peasant's bride,"
1393,CHAPTER III.,For what? for whom? she hardly could explain
1394,CHAPTER III.,"Even to her, the dear St. Magdalen."
1395,CHAPTER III.,"""And yet,"" she argued, ""she at least will know"
1396,CHAPTER III.,"And understand me if no other do."""
1397,CHAPTER III.,
1398,CHAPTER III.,"All this was folly, but it comforted"
1399,CHAPTER III.,"And gave her strength. Then with a calmer head,"
1400,CHAPTER III.,"If not a calmer heart, she turned once more"
1401,CHAPTER III.,From love to life. Her first strong grief was o'er.
1402,CHAPTER III.,
1403,CHAPTER III.,
1404,CHAPTER III.,
1405,CHAPTER III.,
1406,CHAPTER IV.,CHAPTER IV.
1407,CHAPTER IV.,
1408,CHAPTER IV.,
1409,CHAPTER IV.,How shall I take up this vain parable
1410,CHAPTER IV.,"And ravel out its issue? Heaven and hell,"
1411,CHAPTER IV.,"The principles of good and evil thought,"
1412,CHAPTER IV.,"Embodied in our lives, have blindly fought"
1413,CHAPTER IV.,Too long for empire in my soul to leave
1414,CHAPTER IV.,"Much for its utterance, much that it can grieve."
1415,CHAPTER IV.,"A soldier on the battlefield of life,"
1416,CHAPTER IV.,"I have grown callous to the signs of strife,"
1417,CHAPTER IV.,And feel the wounds of others and my own
1418,CHAPTER IV.,With scarce a tremor and without a groan.
1419,CHAPTER IV.,"I have seen many perish in their sins,"
1420,CHAPTER IV.,"Known much of frailty and inconsequence,"
1421,CHAPTER IV.,"And if I laughed once, now I dare not be"
1422,CHAPTER IV.,Other than sad at man's insanity.
1423,CHAPTER IV.,"Therefore, in all humility of years,"
1424,CHAPTER IV.,"Colder and wiser for hopes drowned in tears,"
1425,CHAPTER IV.,"And seeking no more quarries for my mirth,"
1426,CHAPTER IV.,"Who most need pity of the sons of earth,"
1427,CHAPTER IV.,"I dip in kindlier ink my chastened pen,"
1428,CHAPTER IV.,And fill of my lost tale what leaves remain.
1429,CHAPTER IV.,
1430,CHAPTER IV.,Years passed. Griselda from my wandering sight
1431,CHAPTER IV.,"Had waned and vanished, like a meteor bright,"
1432,CHAPTER IV.,"Leaving no pathway in my manhood's heaven,"
1433,CHAPTER IV.,Save only memories vaguely unforgiven
1434,CHAPTER IV.,"Of something fair and sad, which for a day"
1435,CHAPTER IV.,Had lit its zenith and had gone its way.
1436,CHAPTER IV.,"Rome and the Prince, the tale that I had heard,"
1437,CHAPTER IV.,Griselda's beauty--all that once had stirred
1438,CHAPTER IV.,"My curious thought to wonder and regret,"
1439,CHAPTER IV.,"In the vexed problem of her woman's fate,"
1440,CHAPTER IV.,"Had yielded place to the world's work-day cares,"
1441,CHAPTER IV.,The wealth it covets and the toil it dares.
1442,CHAPTER IV.,"I was no more a boy, when idle chance"
1443,CHAPTER IV.,And that light favour which attends romance
1444,CHAPTER IV.,Brought me once more within the transient spell
1445,CHAPTER IV.,"Of other days, and dreams of Lady L."
1446,CHAPTER IV.,
1447,CHAPTER IV.,'Twas in September (I have always found
1448,CHAPTER IV.,"That month in my life's record dangerous ground,"
1449,CHAPTER IV.,Whether it be due to some unreasoned stress
1450,CHAPTER IV.,"Of the mad stars which dog our happiness,"
1451,CHAPTER IV.,Or whether--since in truth most things are due
1452,CHAPTER IV.,"To natural causes, if our blindness knew--"
1453,CHAPTER IV.,"To the strong law of Nature's first decay,"
1454,CHAPTER IV.,"Warning betimes of time that cannot stay,"
1455,CHAPTER IV.,"And summer perishing, and hours to come,"
1456,CHAPTER IV.,Lit by less hope in the year's martyrdom;
1457,CHAPTER IV.,And so we needs must seize at any cost
1458,CHAPTER IV.,Fleet pleasure's hem lest all our day be lost)
1459,CHAPTER IV.,"'Twas in September, at a country house"
1460,CHAPTER IV.,"In the Midland shires, where I had come, God knows,"
1461,CHAPTER IV.,Without a thought but of such joyous sort
1462,CHAPTER IV.,As manhood ventures in the realms of sport
1463,CHAPTER IV.,With that dear god of slaughter England's sons
1464,CHAPTER IV.,"Adore with incense-smoke and roar of guns,"
1465,CHAPTER IV.,That this new chapter opens. Who had guessed
1466,CHAPTER IV.,So rare a phoenix housed in such a nest?
1467,CHAPTER IV.,
1468,CHAPTER IV.,"For we, in truth, were no wise company,"
1469,CHAPTER IV.,"Men strong and joyous, keen of hand and eye,"
1470,CHAPTER IV.,"And shrewd for pleasure, but whose subtlest wit"
1471,CHAPTER IV.,"Was still to jest at life while using it,"
1472,CHAPTER IV.,"And jest at love, as at a fruit low hung"
1473,CHAPTER IV.,"To all men's lips, no matter whence it sprung."
1474,CHAPTER IV.,"A fool's philosophy, yet dear to youth"
1475,CHAPTER IV.,"Bred without knowledge of the nobler truth,"
1476,CHAPTER IV.,"And seeming wisdom, till the bitter taste"
1477,CHAPTER IV.,Of grief has come to cure its overhaste.
1478,CHAPTER IV.,"Naught was there, in the scene nor in the parts"
1479,CHAPTER IV.,"Played by the actors, worthy serious hearts,"
1480,CHAPTER IV.,Or worthy her whose passion trod a stage
1481,CHAPTER IV.,"High o'er the frailties of our prurient age,"
1482,CHAPTER IV.,Griselda and her unattained fair dream
1483,CHAPTER IV.,Of noble deeds and griefs unknown to them.
1484,CHAPTER IV.,How came she there?
1485,CHAPTER IV.,
1486,CHAPTER IV.,Our hostess was a woman
1487,CHAPTER IV.,"Less famed for wisdom than a heart all human,"
1488,CHAPTER IV.,"Rich in life's gifts, a wealthy generous soul,"
1489,CHAPTER IV.,But still too fair and still too bountiful.
1490,CHAPTER IV.,"The rest, mad hoydens of the world, whose worth"
1491,CHAPTER IV.,"Lay mired with folly, earthiest of the earth."
1492,CHAPTER IV.,How came she there?
1493,CHAPTER IV.,
1494,CHAPTER IV.,"When I, unconscious all"
1495,CHAPTER IV.,"Of such high presence at our festival,"
1496,CHAPTER IV.,Heard her name bandied in the general hum
1497,CHAPTER IV.,"Of hungry tongues, which told the guests had come,"
1498,CHAPTER IV.,"And saw in converse with our host the form,"
1499,CHAPTER IV.,"Familiar once in sunshine and in storm,"
1500,CHAPTER IV.,Of her who was to me the type and sign
1501,CHAPTER IV.,"Of all things noble, not to say Divine,"
1502,CHAPTER IV.,"Breathing the atmosphere of that vain house,"
1503,CHAPTER IV.,"My heart stopped beating. Half incredulous,"
1504,CHAPTER IV.,"I looked and questioned in my neighbours' eyes,"
1505,CHAPTER IV.,Seeking the sense of this supreme surprise.
1506,CHAPTER IV.,"My thought took words, as at the table set"
1507,CHAPTER IV.,"Men's lips were loosed, discoursing while they ate,"
1508,CHAPTER IV.,And each to each.
1509,CHAPTER IV.,
1510,CHAPTER IV.,"Beside me, of the crew"
1511,CHAPTER IV.,Of gilded youths who swelled the retinue
1512,CHAPTER IV.,Of our fair hostess in her daily lot
1513,CHAPTER IV.,"Of hunting laughter when field sports were not,"
1514,CHAPTER IV.,"Sat one, a joyous boy, whom fashion's freak,"
1515,CHAPTER IV.,"A mad-cap courage and a beardless cheek,"
1516,CHAPTER IV.,Had set pre-eminent in pleasure's school
1517,CHAPTER IV.,To play the hero and to play the fool
1518,CHAPTER IV.,For those few years which are the summer's day
1519,CHAPTER IV.,Of fashion's foils ere they are cast away.
1520,CHAPTER IV.,"Young Jerry Manton! Happy fortune's son,"
1521,CHAPTER IV.,"What heights of vanity your creed had won,"
1522,CHAPTER IV.,"Creed of adventure, and untiring words"
1523,CHAPTER IV.,And songs and loves as brainless as a bird's.
1524,CHAPTER IV.,"Who would not envy you your lack of sense,"
1525,CHAPTER IV.,"Your lawless jibes, your wealth of insolence,"
1526,CHAPTER IV.,The glory of your triumphs unconcealed
1527,CHAPTER IV.,In pleasure's inmost and most sacred field!
1528,CHAPTER IV.,"Who would not share the sunshine of your mirth,"
1529,CHAPTER IV.,"Your god-like smile, your consciousness of worth,"
1530,CHAPTER IV.,"The keenness of your wit in the world's ways,"
1531,CHAPTER IV.,Your heart so callous to its blame or praise!
1532,CHAPTER IV.,"Him I addressed, in pursuance of my doubt"
1533,CHAPTER IV.,How such a prodigy had come about.
1534,CHAPTER IV.,
1535,CHAPTER IV.,"Young Manton eyed me. ""Every road,"" he said,"
1536,CHAPTER IV.,"""Leads--well--to Rome."" He laughed and shook his head,"
1537,CHAPTER IV.,As if in censure of a thought less sage.
1538,CHAPTER IV.,"""My lady's thirty is a dangerous age,"
1539,CHAPTER IV.,And of the three where most misfortunes come
1540,CHAPTER IV.,"Is the worst strewn with wrecks in Christendom."""
1541,CHAPTER IV.,"""You see,"" he added, ""we are not all wise"
1542,CHAPTER IV.,"In all dilemmas and all companies,"
1543,CHAPTER IV.,And there are times and seasons when the best
1544,CHAPTER IV.,"Has need of an hour's frolic with the rest,"
1545,CHAPTER IV.,If only to set free the importunate load
1546,CHAPTER IV.,Of trouble pressing on an uphill road.
1547,CHAPTER IV.,Women's first snare is vanity. At twenty
1548,CHAPTER IV.,"Praises are pleasant, be they ne'er so plenty;"
1549,CHAPTER IV.,"And some, the foolish ones, are thus soon caught"
1550,CHAPTER IV.,Seeking to justify the flattery taught.
1551,CHAPTER IV.,"These are the spendthrifts, dear ingenuous souls,"
1552,CHAPTER IV.,"Whose names emblazoned stand on pleasure's rolls,"
1553,CHAPTER IV.,"Manning the hosts of mirth. Apart from them,"
1554,CHAPTER IV.,"More serious or less eager in their aim,"
1555,CHAPTER IV.,"The wise ones wait like birds that hold aloof,"
1556,CHAPTER IV.,Conscious of danger and the cloven hoof.
1557,CHAPTER IV.,"Yet there are times."""
1558,CHAPTER IV.,
1559,CHAPTER IV.,He paused awhile and sighed.
1560,CHAPTER IV.,"""The second snare,"" said he, ""is set less wide;"
1561,CHAPTER IV.,It stands midway between the dawn of youth
1562,CHAPTER IV.,"And beauty's sunset, with its naked truth,"
1563,CHAPTER IV.,"A danger hidden cunningly in flowers,"
1564,CHAPTER IV.,And the wild drowsing of the noontide hours.
1565,CHAPTER IV.,"Here fall the elect, the chosen virtuous few,"
1566,CHAPTER IV.,"Who have outlived the worst the storm could do,"
1567,CHAPTER IV.,"But faint when it is over, through mere stress"
1568,CHAPTER IV.,Of their mortality's first weariness.
1569,CHAPTER IV.,"'Tis hard to see youth perish, even when"
1570,CHAPTER IV.,Ourselves to the mad warrant have set pen;
1571,CHAPTER IV.,And for the wisest there are days of grief
1572,CHAPTER IV.,And secret doubts and hours of unbelief
1573,CHAPTER IV.,In all things but the one forbidden bliss
1574,CHAPTER IV.,"Churchmen forbid, and poets call a kiss."
1575,CHAPTER IV.,Why should we wonder? 'Tis a kindlier fate
1576,CHAPTER IV.,"At least than that, the last, which comes too late,"
1577,CHAPTER IV.,The old fool's folly nursed at forty-five.
1578,CHAPTER IV.,"Griselda is an angel, but alive,"
1579,CHAPTER IV.,"Believe me, to her wings."" A fatuous flush"
1580,CHAPTER IV.,"Mantled his face, not quite perhaps a blush,"
1581,CHAPTER IV.,"But something conscious, as of one who knows."
1582,CHAPTER IV.,"""Virtue and pleasure are not always foes,"""
1583,CHAPTER IV.,"He sighed. ""And much depends upon the man."""
1584,CHAPTER IV.,
1585,CHAPTER IV.,"I turned impatient. There, behind her fan,"
1586,CHAPTER IV.,"At the far table's end, Griselda's eyes"
1587,CHAPTER IV.,"Were watching us, half hid by its disguise,"
1588,CHAPTER IV.,"But conscious too, as if a secret string"
1589,CHAPTER IV.,"Had vibrated 'twixt her and that vain thing,"
1590,CHAPTER IV.,"The cynic boy, whose word was in my ear,"
1591,CHAPTER IV.,Dishonouring to me and him and her.
1592,CHAPTER IV.,"Our eyes met, and hers fell; a sudden pain"
1593,CHAPTER IV.,"Touched me of memory, and in every vein"
1594,CHAPTER IV.,"Ran jealous anger at young Manton's wit,"
1595,CHAPTER IV.,"While, half aloud, I flung my curse on it."
1596,CHAPTER IV.,
1597,CHAPTER IV.,"Later, I found Griselda gravely gay,"
1598,CHAPTER IV.,And glad to see me in the accustomed way
1599,CHAPTER IV.,"Of half affection my long zeal had won,"
1600,CHAPTER IV.,"Her face no older, though the years had spun"
1601,CHAPTER IV.,Some threads unnoticed in her fair brown hair
1602,CHAPTER IV.,"Of lighter hue than I remembered there,"
1603,CHAPTER IV.,Less silver streaked than gold. All else had grown
1604,CHAPTER IV.,"Fairer with time, and tenderer in its tone,"
1605,CHAPTER IV.,As when in August woods a second burst
1606,CHAPTER IV.,Of leaves is seen more golden than the first.
1607,CHAPTER IV.,A woman truly to be loved--but loving?
1608,CHAPTER IV.,"There was the riddle wit despaired of proving,"
1609,CHAPTER IV.,For who can read the stars? I sat with her
1610,CHAPTER IV.,"The evening through, and rose up happier:"
1611,CHAPTER IV.,In all that crowd there was no single face
1612,CHAPTER IV.,"Worthy her notice, not to say her grace,"
1613,CHAPTER IV.,And once again her charm was on my soul.
1614,CHAPTER IV.,"""If she love any""--this was still the goal"
1615,CHAPTER IV.,Of my night thoughts in argument with fear--
1616,CHAPTER IV.,"""Say what they will, the lover is not here."""
1617,CHAPTER IV.,"Not here! And yet, at parting, she had pressed"
1618,CHAPTER IV.,"Manton's sole hand, and nodded to the rest."
1619,CHAPTER IV.,
1620,CHAPTER IV.,"Four days I lived in my fool's paradise,"
1621,CHAPTER IV.,Importuning Griselda's changing eyes
1622,CHAPTER IV.,With idle flattery. I found her mood
1623,CHAPTER IV.,"Softer than once in her young womanhood,"
1624,CHAPTER IV.,Yet restless and uncertain. There were hours
1625,CHAPTER IV.,"Of a wild gaiety, when all the powers"
1626,CHAPTER IV.,"Of her keen mind were in revolt with folly,"
1627,CHAPTER IV.,Others bedimmed with wordless melancholy.
1628,CHAPTER IV.,Once too or twice she shocked me with a phrase
1629,CHAPTER IV.,"Of doubtful sense, revealing thoughts and ways"
1630,CHAPTER IV.,"New to her past, an echo of the noise"
1631,CHAPTER IV.,Of that mad world we lived in and its joys:
1632,CHAPTER IV.,Such things were sacrilege. I could not see
1633,CHAPTER IV.,"Unmoved my angel smirched with vanity,"
1634,CHAPTER IV.,"Even though, it seemed at moments, for my sake."
1635,CHAPTER IV.,"Her laughter, when she laughed, made my heart ache,"
1636,CHAPTER IV.,And I had spared some pain to see her sad
1637,CHAPTER IV.,Rather than thus unseasonably glad.
1638,CHAPTER IV.,
1639,CHAPTER IV.,"Who would have dreamed it? Each new idle day,"
1640,CHAPTER IV.,"When, tired with sport, we rested from the fray,"
1641,CHAPTER IV.,"Five jovial shooters, jaded by the sun,"
1642,CHAPTER IV.,"Seeking refreshment at the stroke of noon,--"
1643,CHAPTER IV.,"There, with the luncheon carts all trimly dight,"
1644,CHAPTER IV.,"Stood Lady L., to the fool crowd's delight."
1645,CHAPTER IV.,You would have thought her life had always been
1646,CHAPTER IV.,"Passed in the stubbles, as, with questions keen,"
1647,CHAPTER IV.,"She eyed the bags and parleyed with the ""guns;"""
1648,CHAPTER IV.,Rome's matron she with us the Goths and Huns.
1649,CHAPTER IV.,Young Manton proudly spread for her his coat
1650,CHAPTER IV.,"Under a hedge, and she resented not."
1651,CHAPTER IV.,"Resented! Why resent? Nay, smiles were there."
1652,CHAPTER IV.,"And a swift look of pleasure, still more rare,"
1653,CHAPTER IV.,"Pleasure and gratitude, as though the act"
1654,CHAPTER IV.,Had been of chivalry in form and fact
1655,CHAPTER IV.,"Transcending Raleigh's. Ay, indeed! Resent!"
1656,CHAPTER IV.,That eye were blind which doubted what it meant.
1657,CHAPTER IV.,
1658,CHAPTER IV.,And still I doubted. Vanity dies hard.
1659,CHAPTER IV.,"And love, however starving of reward,"
1660,CHAPTER IV.,And youth's creed of belief. It seemed a thing
1661,CHAPTER IV.,"Monstrous, impossible, bewildering,"
1662,CHAPTER IV.,As tales of dwarfs and giants gravely told
1663,CHAPTER IV.,"By men of science, and transmuted gold,"
1664,CHAPTER IV.,"And magic potions turning men to beasts,"
1665,CHAPTER IV.,And lewd witch Sabbaths danced by unfrocked priests.
1666,CHAPTER IV.,Griselda! Manton! In what mood or tense
1667,CHAPTER IV.,"Could folly conjugate such dreams to sense,"
1668,CHAPTER IV.,Or draw the contract not in terms absurd
1669,CHAPTER IV.,Of such a friendship or of act or word?
1670,CHAPTER IV.,Where was the common thought between the two--
1671,CHAPTER IV.,Even of partridges--the other knew?
1672,CHAPTER IV.,"Manton--Griselda! Nay 'twere fabulous,"
1673,CHAPTER IV.,"A mere profanity, to argue thus;"
1674,CHAPTER IV.,Only I watched them closer when they strayed
1675,CHAPTER IV.,"To gather blackberries, as boy and maid"
1676,CHAPTER IV.,"In a first courting, and her eager eyes"
1677,CHAPTER IV.,"Turned as he spoke, and laughter came unwise"
1678,CHAPTER IV.,"Before she answered, and an hour was flown,"
1679,CHAPTER IV.,Before he joined the rest and she was gone.
1680,CHAPTER IV.,
1681,CHAPTER IV.,"O Love! what an absurdity thou art,"
1682,CHAPTER IV.,"How heedless of proportion, whole or part!"
1683,CHAPTER IV.,"Time, place, occasion, what are they to thee?"
1684,CHAPTER IV.,"Thou playest the wanton with Solemnity,"
1685,CHAPTER IV.,"The prince with Poverty, the rogue with Worth,"
1686,CHAPTER IV.,The fool with all the Wisdoms of the Earth.
1687,CHAPTER IV.,"Thou art a leveller, more renowned than Death,"
1688,CHAPTER IV.,"For he, when in his rage he stops our breath,"
1689,CHAPTER IV.,"Leaves us at least the harvest of our years,"
1690,CHAPTER IV.,The right to be heroic in our tears.
1691,CHAPTER IV.,But thou dost only mock. Thou art a king
1692,CHAPTER IV.,"Dealing with slaves, who waits no questioning,"
1693,CHAPTER IV.,"But gives--to this a province and a crown,"
1694,CHAPTER IV.,To that a beggar's staff and spangled gown;
1695,CHAPTER IV.,"And when some weep their undeserved disgrace,"
1696,CHAPTER IV.,Plucks at their cheeks and smites them in the face.
1697,CHAPTER IV.,"Thou hast no reverence, no respect for right."
1698,CHAPTER IV.,"Virtue to thee is a lewd appetite,"
1699,CHAPTER IV.,"Remorse a pastime, modesty a lure,"
1700,CHAPTER IV.,"And love, the malady, love's only cure."
1701,CHAPTER IV.,
1702,CHAPTER IV.,"Griselda, in her love at thirty-three,"
1703,CHAPTER IV.,Was the supreme fool of felicity.
1704,CHAPTER IV.,"Reason and she had taken separate roads,"
1705,CHAPTER IV.,A spectacle of mirth for men and gods.
1706,CHAPTER IV.,And the world laughed--discreetly in its sleeves--
1707,CHAPTER IV.,At her poor artless shifts and make-believes.
1708,CHAPTER IV.,"For it was true, true to the very text,"
1709,CHAPTER IV.,"This whispered thing that had my soul perplexed,"
1710,CHAPTER IV.,"Manton was her beloved--by what art,"
1711,CHAPTER IV.,"What mute equation of the human heart,"
1712,CHAPTER IV.,"What blind jibe of dame Fortune, who shall say?"
1713,CHAPTER IV.,"The road of passion is no king's highway,"
1714,CHAPTER IV.,"Mapped out with finger-posts for all to see,"
1715,CHAPTER IV.,"But each soul journeys on it separately,"
1716,CHAPTER IV.,And only those who have walked its mazes through
1717,CHAPTER IV.,Remember on what paths the wild flowers grew.
1718,CHAPTER IV.,
1719,CHAPTER IV.,"Ay, who shall say? Nor had the truth been sung,"
1720,CHAPTER IV.,"Save for the incontinence of Manton's tongue,"
1721,CHAPTER IV.,"Wagging in argument on certain themes,"

1739,CHAPTER IV.,"Colours, books tell us, to be strongly blent,"
1740,CHAPTER IV.,"Need opposite colours for their complement,"
1741,CHAPTER IV.,And so too women whose ill-reasoning mind
1742,CHAPTER IV.,"Requires some contradiction to be kind."""
1743,CHAPTER IV.,
1744,CHAPTER IV.,"""It is not enough in this late year of grace"
1745,CHAPTER IV.,To answer fools with their own foolishness--
1746,CHAPTER IV.,Rather with your best wisdom. You will need
1747,CHAPTER IV.,Your folly to perplex some wiser head.
1748,CHAPTER IV.,"And so my maxim is, whatever least"
1749,CHAPTER IV.,"Women expect, that thing will serve you best."
1750,CHAPTER IV.,"Thus, with young souls in their first unfledged years,"
1751,CHAPTER IV.,Ask their opinion as philosophers:
1752,CHAPTER IV.,Consult their knowledge in the ways of life.
1753,CHAPTER IV.,The repute of sin will please a too chaste wife.
1754,CHAPTER IV.,Your deference keep for harlots: these you touch
1755,CHAPTER IV.,"Best by your modesty, which makes them blush."
1756,CHAPTER IV.,"With a proud beauty deal out insolence,"
1757,CHAPTER IV.,And bear her fence down with a stronger fence.
1758,CHAPTER IV.,"She will be angry, but a softer cheek"
1759,CHAPTER IV.,Turn to the smiter who has proved her weak.
1760,CHAPTER IV.,"And so with wisdom: meet it with surprise,"
1761,CHAPTER IV.,"Laugh at it idly gazing in its eyes,"
1762,CHAPTER IV.,"Leave it no solid ground for its fair feet,"
1763,CHAPTER IV.,And lead it lightly where love's waters meet.
1764,CHAPTER IV.,"Even virtue--virtue of the noblest type,"
1765,CHAPTER IV.,"The fair sad woman, whose romance is ripe,"
1766,CHAPTER IV.,"Needs but a little knowledge to be led,"
1767,CHAPTER IV.,Perhaps less than the rest if truth be said.
1768,CHAPTER IV.,"You must not parley with her. Words are vain,"
1769,CHAPTER IV.,And you might wake some half forgotten pain.
1770,CHAPTER IV.,Avoid her soul. It is a place too strong
1771,CHAPTER IV.,"For your assaulting, and a siege were long."
1772,CHAPTER IV.,"Others have failed before it. Touch it not,"
1773,CHAPTER IV.,"But march beyond, nor fire a single shot."
1774,CHAPTER IV.,The fields of pleasure less defended lie:
1775,CHAPTER IV.,These are your vantage-ground for victory.
1776,CHAPTER IV.,Strike boldly for possession and command;
1777,CHAPTER IV.,"An hour may win it, if you hold her hand."
1778,CHAPTER IV.,"I knew one once:""..."
1779,CHAPTER IV.,
1780,CHAPTER IV.,I would have stopped him here
1781,CHAPTER IV.,But for the shame which held me prisoner;
1782,CHAPTER IV.,"And his undaunted reassuring smile,"
1783,CHAPTER IV.,"Commanding confidence. ""I knew once on a while,"""
1784,CHAPTER IV.,"He said, ""a woman whom the world called proud,"
1785,CHAPTER IV.,"A saintly soul, untouched by the vain crowd,"
1786,CHAPTER IV.,"Who had survived all battle, siege, and sack,"
1787,CHAPTER IV.,"Love ever led with armies at his back,"
1788,CHAPTER IV.,Yet fell at last to the mere accident
1789,CHAPTER IV.,"Of a chance meeting, for another meant:"
1790,CHAPTER IV.,"Her lover had not dared it, had he known,"
1791,CHAPTER IV.,But faces in the dark are all as one.
1792,CHAPTER IV.,"You know the rhyme."""
1793,CHAPTER IV.,
1794,CHAPTER IV.,"But at this point I rose,"
1795,CHAPTER IV.,"Fearing what worse his folly might disclose,"
1796,CHAPTER IV.,"And having learned my lesson of romance,"
1797,CHAPTER IV.,"A sadder man and wiser for the chance,"
1798,CHAPTER IV.,"Bade him good night: (it was in truth good-bye,"
1799,CHAPTER IV.,For pretexting next morning some small lie
1800,CHAPTER IV.,"Of business calling me in haste to town,"

1802,CHAPTER IV.,"Yawned, rose to light his candle at the lamp,"
1803,CHAPTER IV.,"Pressed with warm hand my own hand which was damp,"
1804,CHAPTER IV.,"And as he sauntered cheerily to bed,"
1805,CHAPTER IV.,I heard him sing--they linger in my head--
1806,CHAPTER IV.,"The first staves of a ballad, then the fashion"
1807,CHAPTER IV.,With the young bloods who shape their love and passion
1808,CHAPTER IV.,At the music-halls of the Metropolis;
1809,CHAPTER IV.,What I remember of the song was this:
1810,CHAPTER IV.,
1811,CHAPTER IV.,"But, no, I cannot write it. There are things"
1812,CHAPTER IV.,"Too bitter in their taste, and this one stings"
1813,CHAPTER IV.,My soul to a mad anger even yet.
1814,CHAPTER IV.,I seem to hear the voices of the pit
1815,CHAPTER IV.,"Lewdly discoursing of incestuous scenes,"
1816,CHAPTER IV.,Bottom the weaver's and the enamoured queen's.
1817,CHAPTER IV.,"Alas, Titania! thou poor soul, alas!"
1818,CHAPTER IV.,"How art thou fallen, and to what an ass!"
1819,CHAPTER IV.,
1820,CHAPTER IV.,
1821,CHAPTER IV.,
1822,CHAPTER IV.,
1823,CHAPTER V.,CHAPTER V.
1824,CHAPTER V.,
1825,CHAPTER V.,
1826,CHAPTER V.,"Griselda's madness lasted forty days,"
1827,CHAPTER V.,"Forty eternities! Men went their ways,"
1828,CHAPTER V.,"And suns arose and set, and women smiled,"
1829,CHAPTER V.,And tongues wagged lightly in impeachment wild
1830,CHAPTER V.,"Of Lady L.'s adventure. She was gone,"
1831,CHAPTER V.,"None knew by whom escorted or alone,"
1832,CHAPTER V.,"Or why or whither, only that one morning,"
1833,CHAPTER V.,"Without pretext or subterfuge or warning,"
1834,CHAPTER V.,"She had disappeared in silence from L. House,"
1835,CHAPTER V.,Leaving her lord in multitudinous
1836,CHAPTER V.,And agonised conjecture of her fate:
1837,CHAPTER V.,So the tale went. And truly less sedate
1838,CHAPTER V.,"Than his wont was in intricate affairs,"
1839,CHAPTER V.,"Such as his Garter or his lack of heirs,"
1840,CHAPTER V.,Lord L. was seen in this new tribulation.
1841,CHAPTER V.,"Griselda long had been his life's equation,"
1842,CHAPTER V.,"The pivot of his dealings with the world,"
1843,CHAPTER V.,"The mainstay of his comfort, all now hurled"
1844,CHAPTER V.,To unforeseen confusion by her flight:
1845,CHAPTER V.,There was need of action swift and definite.
1846,CHAPTER V.,Where was she? Who could tell him? Divers visions
1847,CHAPTER V.,"Passed through his fancy--thieves, and street collisions,"
1848,CHAPTER V.,"And all the hundred accidents of towns,"
1849,CHAPTER V.,From broken axle trees to broken crowns.
1850,CHAPTER V.,In vain he questioned; no response was made
1851,CHAPTER V.,"More than the fact that, as already said,"
1852,CHAPTER V.,"My lady, unattended and on foot,"
1853,CHAPTER V.,"(A sad imprudence here Lord L. took note),"
1854,CHAPTER V.,Had gone out dressed in a black morning gown
1855,CHAPTER V.,"And dark tweed waterproof, 'twixt twelve and one,"
1856,CHAPTER V.,"Leaving no orders to her maid, or plan"
1857,CHAPTER V.,About her carriage to or groom or man.
1858,CHAPTER V.,Such was in sum the downstairs' evidence.
1859,CHAPTER V.,"The hall porter, a man of ponderous sense,"
1860,CHAPTER V.,Averred her ladyship had eastward turned
1861,CHAPTER V.,"From the front door, and some small credit earned"
1862,CHAPTER V.,For the suggestion that her steps were bent
1863,CHAPTER V.,"To Whitechapel on merciful intent,"
1864,CHAPTER V.,"A visit of compassion to the poor,"
1865,CHAPTER V.,A clue which led to a commissioner
1866,CHAPTER V.,Being sent for in hot haste from Scotland Yard.
1867,CHAPTER V.,And so the news was bruited abroad.
1868,CHAPTER V.,
1869,CHAPTER V.,"It reached my ears among the earliest,"
1870,CHAPTER V.,"And from Lord L. himself, whose long suppressed"
1871,CHAPTER V.,Emotion found its vent one afternoon
1872,CHAPTER V.,"On me, the only listener left in town."
1873,CHAPTER V.,"His thoughts now ran on ""a religious craze"
1874,CHAPTER V.,"Of his poor wife's,"" he said, ""in these last days"
1875,CHAPTER V.,"Indulged beyond all reason."" The police"
1876,CHAPTER V.,"Would listen to no talk of casualties,"
1877,CHAPTER V.,"Still less of crime, since they had nothing found"
1878,CHAPTER V.,"In evidence above or under ground,"
1879,CHAPTER V.,"But held the case to be of simpler kind,"
1880,CHAPTER V.,Home left in a disordered state of mind
1881,CHAPTER V.,"Lord L. had noticed, now they talked of it,"
1882,CHAPTER V.,"Temper less equable and flightier wit,"
1883,CHAPTER V.,"""A craving for religious services"
1884,CHAPTER V.,"And sacred music."" Something was amiss,"
1885,CHAPTER V.,Or why were they in London in September?
1886,CHAPTER V.,"Griselda latterly, he could remember,"
1887,CHAPTER V.,Had raved of a conventual retreat
1888,CHAPTER V.,"In terms no Protestant would deem discreet,"
1889,CHAPTER V.,As the sole refuge in a world of sin
1890,CHAPTER V.,"For human frailty, griefs best anodyne."
1891,CHAPTER V.,"""The _Times_ was right. Rome threatened to absorb us:"
1892,CHAPTER V.,"The convents must be searched by _habeas corpus_."""
1893,CHAPTER V.,
1894,CHAPTER V.,And so I came to help him. I had guessed
1895,CHAPTER V.,"From his first word the vainness of his quest,"
1896,CHAPTER V.,And half was moved to serve him in a strait
1897,CHAPTER V.,"Where her fair fame I loved was in debate,"
1898,CHAPTER V.,"Yet held my peace, nor hazarded a word"
1899,CHAPTER V.,"Save of surprise at the strange case I heard,"
1900,CHAPTER V.,"Till, fortune aiding, I should find the clue"
1901,CHAPTER V.,My heart desired to do what I would do.
1902,CHAPTER V.,"And not in vain. Night found me duly sped,"
1903,CHAPTER V.,"Lord L.'s ambassador accredited,"
1904,CHAPTER V.,"With fullest powers to find and fetch her home,"
1905,CHAPTER V.,"If need should be, from the Pope's jaws in Rome."
1906,CHAPTER V.,
1907,CHAPTER V.,Gods! what a mission! First my round I went
1908,CHAPTER V.,"Through half the slums of Middlesex and Kent,"
1909,CHAPTER V.,"Surrey and Essex--this to soothe Lord L.,"
1910,CHAPTER V.,"Though witless all, as my heart told too well;"
1911,CHAPTER V.,"The hospitals no less and casual wards,"
1912,CHAPTER V.,"Each house as idly as his House of Lords,"
1913,CHAPTER V.,And only at the week's end dared to stop
1914,CHAPTER V.,"At the one door I knew still housing hope,"
1915,CHAPTER V.,"Young Manton's chambers. There, with reddened cheek"
1916,CHAPTER V.,I heard the answer given I came to seek:
1917,CHAPTER V.,"Manton was gone, his landlady half feared"
1918,CHAPTER V.,"He too, in some mishap, and disappeared,--"
1919,CHAPTER V.,Proof all too positive. His letters lay
1920,CHAPTER V.,A fortnight deep untouched upon the tray.
1921,CHAPTER V.,She could not forward them or risk a guess
1922,CHAPTER V.,As to his last or likeliest address.
1923,CHAPTER V.,"He was in Scotland often at this season,"
1924,CHAPTER V.,"""But not without his guns""--a cogent reason,"
1925,CHAPTER V.,"And leaving, too, his valet here in town,"
1926,CHAPTER V.,Perplexed of what to do or leave undone.
1927,CHAPTER V.,"Abroad? Perhaps. If so, his friends might try"
1928,CHAPTER V.,As a best chance the Paris Embassy.
1929,CHAPTER V.,"He had been there last Spring, and might be now."
1930,CHAPTER V.,
1931,CHAPTER V.,"Paris! It was enough, I made my bow,"
1932,CHAPTER V.,And took my leave. I seemed to touch the thread
1933,CHAPTER V.,Of the blind labyrinth 'twas mine to tread.
1934,CHAPTER V.,"Where should they be, in truth, these too fond lovers,"
1935,CHAPTER V.,But in the land of all such lawless rovers:
1936,CHAPTER V.,"The land of Gautier, Bourget, Maupassant,"
1937,CHAPTER V.,"Where still ""you can"" makes answer to ""I can't:"""
1938,CHAPTER V.,The fair domain where all romance begins
1939,CHAPTER V.,"In a light borderland of venial sins,"
1940,CHAPTER V.,"But deepening onwards, till the fatal day"
1941,CHAPTER V.,"Vice swoops upon us, plead we as we may."
1942,CHAPTER V.,"Griselda's bonnet o'er the windmills thrown,"
1943,CHAPTER V.,Had surely crossed the Seine e'er it came down;
1944,CHAPTER V.,"And I, if I would find and win her back,"
1945,CHAPTER V.,Must earliest search the boulevards for her track:
1946,CHAPTER V.,"And so to Paris in my zeal I passed,"
1947,CHAPTER V.,"Breaking my idol, mad Iconoclast."
1948,CHAPTER V.,
1949,CHAPTER V.,There is a little inn by Meudon wood
1950,CHAPTER V.,"Dear to Parisians in their amorous mood,"

1952,CHAPTER V.,Their best beloved in congregation sweet:
1953,CHAPTER V.,"Clandestine, undisturbed, illicit loves,"
1954,CHAPTER V.,"Made half romantic by the adjoining groves,"
1955,CHAPTER V.,"So beautiful in spring, with the new green"
1956,CHAPTER V.,"Clothing the birch stems scattered white between,"
1957,CHAPTER V.,"Nor yet, in autumn, when the first frosts burn,"
1958,CHAPTER V.,"And the wind rustles in the reddening fern,"
1959,CHAPTER V.,"Quite robbed of sentiment for lovers' eyes,"
1960,CHAPTER V.,"Who seek earth's blessing on a bliss unwise,"
1961,CHAPTER V.,And find the happy sanction for their state
1962,CHAPTER V.,"In nature's face, unshocked by their debate,"

1966,CHAPTER V.,"Such fancy, may be, in her too fond heart"
1967,CHAPTER V.,"Had led Griselda--with her friend--apart,"
1968,CHAPTER V.,"Yet not apart, from the world's curious gaze,"
1969,CHAPTER V.,"To this secluded, ill-frequented place:"
1970,CHAPTER V.,"A compromise of wills and varying moods,"
1971,CHAPTER V.,"His for gay crowds, her own for solitudes."
1972,CHAPTER V.,"Manton knew Paris well, and loved its noise,"
1973,CHAPTER V.,"Its mirthful parody of serious joys,"
1974,CHAPTER V.,Its pomp and circumstance. His wish had been
1975,CHAPTER V.,"To flaunt the boulevards with his captured queen,"
1976,CHAPTER V.,And make parade of a last triumph won
1977,CHAPTER V.,"In the chaste field of prudish Albion,"
1978,CHAPTER V.,Outscandalising scandal. Love and he
1979,CHAPTER V.,"In any sense but of male vanity,"
1980,CHAPTER V.,And the delirium of adventures new
1981,CHAPTER V.,In the world's eye--the thing he next should do--
1982,CHAPTER V.,Were terms diverse and incompatible.
1983,CHAPTER V.,"Griselda, to his eyes, was Lady L.,"
1984,CHAPTER V.,"The fair, the chaste, the unapproached proud name"
1985,CHAPTER V.,"Men breathed in reverence, woman, all the same,"
1986,CHAPTER V.,"And not as such, and when the truth was said,"
1987,CHAPTER V.,Worth more than others lightlier credited.
1988,CHAPTER V.,"It all had been a jest from the beginning,"
1989,CHAPTER V.,"A _tour de force_, whose wit was in the winning,"
1990,CHAPTER V.,"A stroke of fortune and of accident,"
1991,CHAPTER V.,"The embrace he had told of for another meant,"
1992,CHAPTER V.,While she stood grieving for a first grey hair
1993,CHAPTER V.,"(A psychologic moment) on the stair,"
1994,CHAPTER V.,"And, kneeling down, he had adored her foot,"
1995,CHAPTER V.,"The one weak spot where her self-love had root,"
1996,CHAPTER V.,"And laughed at her, and told her she was old,"
1997,CHAPTER V.,Yet growing tenderer as he grew more bold;
1998,CHAPTER V.,"And so from jest to jest, and chance to chance,"
1999,CHAPTER V.,To that last scene at the mad country dance
2000,CHAPTER V.,"Where she had played the hoyden, he the swain,"
2001,CHAPTER V.,"Pretending love till love was in their brain,"
2002,CHAPTER V.,"And he had followed to her chamber door,"
2003,CHAPTER V.,And helped her to undo the dress she wore.
2004,CHAPTER V.,
2005,CHAPTER V.,"Then the elopement. That had been her doing,"
2006,CHAPTER V.,"Which he accepted to make good his wooing,"
2007,CHAPTER V.,"And careless what to both the result might be,"
2008,CHAPTER V.,So it but served his end of vanity.
2009,CHAPTER V.,"It all had been to this vain boy a whim,"
2010,CHAPTER V.,"Something grotesque, a play, a pantomime,"
2011,CHAPTER V.,"Where nothing had been serious but her heart,"
2012,CHAPTER V.,And that was soon too tearful for its part.
2013,CHAPTER V.,He wearied in a week of her mature
2014,CHAPTER V.,"Old maidish venturings in ways obscure,"
2015,CHAPTER V.,"Her agony of conscience dimly guessed,"
2016,CHAPTER V.,"The silences she stifled in her breast,"
2017,CHAPTER V.,Her awkwardness--it was his word--in all
2018,CHAPTER V.,"That love could teach; her sighs funereal,"
2019,CHAPTER V.,And more the unnatural laughter she essayed
2020,CHAPTER V.,To meet the doubtful sense of things he said.
2021,CHAPTER V.,"She was at once too tender and too prim,"
2022,CHAPTER V.,Too prudish and too crazed with love and him.
2023,CHAPTER V.,At a month's end his flame had leaped beyond
2024,CHAPTER V.,"Already to friends frailer and less fond,"
2025,CHAPTER V.,The light Parisian world of venal charms
2026,CHAPTER V.,Which welcomed him with wide and laughing arms:
2027,CHAPTER V.,"There he was happier, more at home, more gay,"
2028,CHAPTER V.,"King of the ""high life,"" hero of the day."
2029,CHAPTER V.,
2030,CHAPTER V.,"Griselda, in her sad suburban nook"
2031,CHAPTER V.,"Watched his departures with a mute rebuke,"
2032,CHAPTER V.,Yet daring not to speak. The choice was hers
2033,CHAPTER V.,To stay at home or run the theatres
2034,CHAPTER V.,With her young lover in such company
2035,CHAPTER V.,As her soul loathed. She had tried despairingly
2036,CHAPTER V.,"To be one, even as these, for his loved sake,"

2038,CHAPTER V.,"But that he hardly further cared to press,"
2039,CHAPTER V.,"After one failure, stamped with ""dowdiness:"""
2040,CHAPTER V.,"That too had been his word, a bitter word,"
2041,CHAPTER V.,"Biting and true, which smote her like a sword,"

2043,CHAPTER V.,"Leaving her humbled, agonised and weak."
2044,CHAPTER V.,
2045,CHAPTER V.,Poor beautiful Griselda! What was now

2055,CHAPTER V.,"And thy archangel, with the feet of clay,"
2056,CHAPTER V.,"Stood mocking there in doubt to go or stay,"
2057,CHAPTER V.,"The unstable fabric of thy woman's dower,"
2058,CHAPTER V.,"Thy beauty, failed and left thee in _their_ power"

2061,CHAPTER V.,"What use was in thy beauty, if, alas!"
2062,CHAPTER V.,Thou gavest them cause to mock--those tongues of brass--
2063,CHAPTER V.,"At thy too crude and insular attire,"

2065,CHAPTER V.,"Of thy first dallyings with the red and white,"
2066,CHAPTER V.,"Thy sweet pictorial robes, Pre-Raphaelite,"
2067,CHAPTER V.,"Quaint in their tones and _outrées_ in design,"
2068,CHAPTER V.,"Thy lack of unity and shape and line,"
2069,CHAPTER V.,"Thy English angularity--who knows,"
2070,CHAPTER V.,The less than perfect fitting of thy shoes?
2071,CHAPTER V.,
2072,CHAPTER V.,"Griselda, in her flight, had left behind"
2073,CHAPTER V.,"All but the dress she stood in, too refined,"
2074,CHAPTER V.,"In her fair righteousness of thought and deed,"
2075,CHAPTER V.,"To make provision for a future need,"
2076,CHAPTER V.,However dire. She was no Israelite
2077,CHAPTER V.,"To go forth from her Pharaoh in the night,"
2078,CHAPTER V.,"With spoils of the Egyptians in her hands,"
2079,CHAPTER V.,And had thrown herself on Manton and on France
2080,CHAPTER V.,"With a full courage worth a nobler cause,"
2081,CHAPTER V.,Grandly oblivious of prudential laws.
2082,CHAPTER V.,"Her earliest trouble, marring even the bliss"
2083,CHAPTER V.,"Of love's first ecstasy, had come of this,"
2084,CHAPTER V.,Her want of clothes--a worse and weightier care
2085,CHAPTER V.,At the mere moment than her soul's despair
2086,CHAPTER V.,For its deep fall from virtuous estate.
2087,CHAPTER V.,"How should she dress herself, she asked of Fate,"
2088,CHAPTER V.,"With neither maid, nor money, nor a name?"
2089,CHAPTER V.,It was her first experiment in shame.
2090,CHAPTER V.,"Now, after all her poor economies,"
2091,CHAPTER V.,"This was the ending read in his vexed eyes,"
2092,CHAPTER V.,And spoken by his lips: her utmost art
2093,CHAPTER V.,"Had failed to please that idle thing, his heart,"
2094,CHAPTER V.,Or even to avert his petulant scorn
2095,CHAPTER V.,For one so little to love's manner born.
2096,CHAPTER V.,
2097,CHAPTER V.,"And thus I found them, at the angry noon"
2098,CHAPTER V.,"Of their ""red month,"" the next to honeymoon:"
2099,CHAPTER V.,"Two silent revellers at a loveless feast,"
2100,CHAPTER V.,Scared by hate's morning breaking in their east--
2101,CHAPTER V.,"A dawn which was of penance and despair,"
2102,CHAPTER V.,With pleasure's ghost to fill the vacant chair.
2103,CHAPTER V.,"I took it, and was welcomed rapturously,"
2104,CHAPTER V.,"As a far sail by shipwrecked souls at sea,"
2105,CHAPTER V.,"An opportune deliverer, timely sent"
2106,CHAPTER V.,"To break the autumn of their discontent,"
2107,CHAPTER V.,And give a pretext to their need grown sore
2108,CHAPTER V.,Of issue from joys dead by any door.
2109,CHAPTER V.,
2110,CHAPTER V.,"Manton, all confidential from the first,"
2111,CHAPTER V.,"Told me the tale of his last sins and worst,"
2112,CHAPTER V.,As meriting a sympathy not less
2113,CHAPTER V.,Than the best actions virtuous men confess.
2114,CHAPTER V.,He was overwhelmed with women and with debt--
2115,CHAPTER V.,"Women who loved him, bills which must be met."
2116,CHAPTER V.,What could he do? Her ladyship was mad--
2117,CHAPTER V.,"It was her fault, not his, this escapade."
2118,CHAPTER V.,"He had warned her from the first, and as a friend,"
2119,CHAPTER V.,"That all such frolics had a serious end,"
2120,CHAPTER V.,And that to leave her home was the worst way
2121,CHAPTER V.,A woman would who wanted to be gay.
2122,CHAPTER V.,
2123,CHAPTER V.,"""For look,"" said he, ""we men, who note these things,"
2124,CHAPTER V.,"And how the unthinking flutterers burn their wings,"
2125,CHAPTER V.,"Know that a woman, be she what she will,"
2126,CHAPTER V.,"The fairest, noblest, most adorable,"
2127,CHAPTER V.,"Dowered in her home with all seraphic charms,"
2128,CHAPTER V.,"Whom heaven itself might envy in your arms,"
2129,CHAPTER V.,A paragon of pleasure undenied
2130,CHAPTER V.,"At her own chaste respectable fireside,"
2131,CHAPTER V.,"Becomes, what shall I say, when she steps down"
2132,CHAPTER V.,From the high world of her untouched renown--
2133,CHAPTER V.,A something differing in no serious mood
2134,CHAPTER V.,From the sad rest of the light sisterhood:
2135,CHAPTER V.,"Perhaps indeed more troublesome than these,"
2136,CHAPTER V.,Because she keenlier feels the agonies:
2137,CHAPTER V.,"A wounded soul, who has not even the wit"
2138,CHAPTER V.,To hide its hurt and make a jest of it;
2139,CHAPTER V.,"A maid of Astolat, launched in her barge,"
2140,CHAPTER V.,"A corpse on all the world, a _femme à charge_."""
2141,CHAPTER V.,
2142,CHAPTER V.,"""'Tis not,"" he argued, ""our poor human sins"
2143,CHAPTER V.,"That make us what we are when shame begins,"
2144,CHAPTER V.,But the world pointing at our naked state:
2145,CHAPTER V.,"Then we are shocked and humbled at our fate,"
2146,CHAPTER V.,Silent and shamed in all we honour most--
2147,CHAPTER V.,For what is virtue but the right to boast?
2148,CHAPTER V.,"A married woman's love, three weeks from home,"
2149,CHAPTER V.,"Is the absurdest thing in Christendom,"
2150,CHAPTER V.,Dull as a _ménage_ in the demi-monde
2151,CHAPTER V.,And dismaller far by reason of the bond.
2152,CHAPTER V.,"All this I told my lady ere we went,"
2153,CHAPTER V.,But warning wasted is on sentiment.
2154,CHAPTER V.,"You see the net result here in one word,"
2155,CHAPTER V.,"A crying woman and a lover bored."""
2156,CHAPTER V.,
2157,CHAPTER V.,"So far young Manton. She for whom I came,"
2158,CHAPTER V.,"Griselda's self, sweet soul, in her new shame"
2159,CHAPTER V.,Essayed awhile to hide from me the truth
2160,CHAPTER V.,"Of this last hap of her belated youth,"
2161,CHAPTER V.,Her disillusion with her graceless lover.
2162,CHAPTER V.,She made sad cloaks for him which could not cover
2163,CHAPTER V.,"His great unworthiness and her despair,"
2164,CHAPTER V.,"All with a frightened half-maternal air,"
2165,CHAPTER V.,"Most pitiful and touching. To my plea,"
2166,CHAPTER V.,"Urging her home, she answered mournfully,"
2167,CHAPTER V.,"That she was bound now to her way of life,"
2168,CHAPTER V.,And owed herself no less than as his wife
2169,CHAPTER V.,To him she had chosen out of all mankind.
2170,CHAPTER V.,"'Twas better to be foolish, even blind,"
2171,CHAPTER V.,"If he had faults, so she could serve him still--"
2172,CHAPTER V.,And this had been her promise and her will.
2173,CHAPTER V.,She would not hear of duties owed elsewhere:
2174,CHAPTER V.,"What was she to Lord L., or he to her?"
2175,CHAPTER V.,I need not speak of it. And yet she clung
2176,CHAPTER V.,To my protecting presence in her wrong;
2177,CHAPTER V.,"And once, when Manton's jibes made bitterer play,"
2178,CHAPTER V.,Implored me with appealing eyes to stay.
2179,CHAPTER V.,And so I lingered on.
2180,CHAPTER V.,
2181,CHAPTER V.,"Those autumn days,"
2182,CHAPTER V.,Spent with Griselda in the woodland ways
2183,CHAPTER V.,"Of Meudon with her lover, or alone,"
2184,CHAPTER V.,"When his mad fancies carried him to town,"
2185,CHAPTER V.,Remain to me an unsubstantial act
2186,CHAPTER V.,"Of dreaming fancy, rather than the fact"
2187,CHAPTER V.,"Of any waking moment in my past,"
2188,CHAPTER V.,"The sweetest, saddest, and with her the last--"
2189,CHAPTER V.,For suddenly they ended.
2190,CHAPTER V.,
2191,CHAPTER V.,We had been
2192,CHAPTER V.,"One Sunday for a jaunt upon the Seine,"
2193,CHAPTER V.,"We two--in Manton's absence, now prolonged"
2194,CHAPTER V.,"To a third night--and in a steamboat, thronged"
2195,CHAPTER V.,"With idle bourgeois folk, whom the last glory"
2196,CHAPTER V.,Of a late autumn had sent forth in foray
2197,CHAPTER V.,"To Passy and St. Cloud, from stage to stage,"
2198,CHAPTER V.,Had made with heavy souls our pilgrimage;
2199,CHAPTER V.,"And homeward turning and with little zest,"
2200,CHAPTER V.,"The fair day done, to love's deserted nest"
2201,CHAPTER V.,"Had come with lagging feet and weary eyes,"
2202,CHAPTER V.,"Expectant still of some new dark surprise,"
2203,CHAPTER V.,"When the blow fell unsparing on her head,"
2204,CHAPTER V.,Already by what fortunes buffeted.
2205,CHAPTER V.,
2206,CHAPTER V.,"How did it happen, that last tragedy?--"
2207,CHAPTER V.,"For tragedy it was, let none deny,"
2208,CHAPTER V.,Though all ignoble. Every soul of us
2209,CHAPTER V.,Touches one moment in death's darkened house
2210,CHAPTER V.,"The plane of the heroic, and compels"
2211,CHAPTER V.,"Men's laughter into tears--ay, heaven's and hell's."
2212,CHAPTER V.,How did it happen? There was that upon
2213,CHAPTER V.,Their faces at the door more than the tone
2214,CHAPTER V.,"Of their replies, that warned us of the thing"
2215,CHAPTER V.,We had not looked for in our questioning;
2216,CHAPTER V.,"And our lips faltered, and our ears, afraid,"
2217,CHAPTER V.,Shrank from more hearing. What was it they said
2218,CHAPTER V.,"In their fool's jargon, that he lay upstairs?"
2219,CHAPTER V.,He? Manton? The dispenser of our cares?
2220,CHAPTER V.,The mountebank young reveller? Suffering? Ill?
2221,CHAPTER V.,"And she, poor soul, that suffered at his will!"
2222,CHAPTER V.,A sinister case? Not dying? Pitiful God!
2223,CHAPTER V.,Truly Thou smitest blindly with Thy rod.
2224,CHAPTER V.,"For Manton was not worthy to die young,"
2225,CHAPTER V.,Beloved by her with blessings on her tongue.
2226,CHAPTER V.,And such a cause of death!
2227,CHAPTER V.,
2228,CHAPTER V.,She never heard
2229,CHAPTER V.,"The whole truth told, for each one spared his word,"
2230,CHAPTER V.,And he lay mute for ever. But to me
2231,CHAPTER V.,"The thing was storied void of mystery,"
2232,CHAPTER V.,And thus they told it. Hardly had we gone
2233,CHAPTER V.,"On our sad river outing, when from town"
2234,CHAPTER V.,"Manton had come with a gay troop of friends,"
2235,CHAPTER V.,"Such as the _coulisse_ of the opera lends,"
2236,CHAPTER V.,To breakfast at the inn and spend the day
2237,CHAPTER V.,"In mirthful noise, as was his vagrant way."
2238,CHAPTER V.,"A drunken frolic, and most insolent"
2239,CHAPTER V.,"To her whose honour with his own was blent,"
2240,CHAPTER V.,To end in this last tragedy. None knew
2241,CHAPTER V.,"Quite how it happened, or a cause could shew"
2242,CHAPTER V.,"Further than this, that, rising from the table"
2243,CHAPTER V.,"The last to go, with steps perhaps unstable--"
2244,CHAPTER V.,"For they had feasted freely, and the stair"
2245,CHAPTER V.,"Was steep and iron-edged, and needed care;"
2246,CHAPTER V.,"And singing, as he went, the selfsame song,"
2247,CHAPTER V.,"Which I remembered, to the laughing throng,"
2248,CHAPTER V.,"He had slipped his length, and fallen feet-first down."
2249,CHAPTER V.,"When they picked him up his power to move was gone,"
2250,CHAPTER V.,"Though he could speak. They laid him on a bed,"
2251,CHAPTER V.,"Her bed, Griselda's, and called in with speed"
2252,CHAPTER V.,Such help of doctors and commissioners
2253,CHAPTER V.,"As law prescribed, and medicine for their fears."
2254,CHAPTER V.,'Twas his last night.
2255,CHAPTER V.,
2256,CHAPTER V.,"There, in Griselda's hands,"
2257,CHAPTER V.,Young Jerry Manton lay with the last sands
2258,CHAPTER V.,"Of his life's hour-glass trickling to its close,"
2259,CHAPTER V.,"Griselda watching, with what thoughts, God knows."
2260,CHAPTER V.,"We did not speak. But her lips moved in prayer,"
2261,CHAPTER V.,"And mine too, in the way of man's despair."
2262,CHAPTER V.,"I did not love him, yet a human pity"
2263,CHAPTER V.,"Softened my eyes. Afar, from the great city,"
2264,CHAPTER V.,"The sound came to us of the eternal hum,"
2265,CHAPTER V.,"Unceasing, changeless, pregnant with all doom"
2266,CHAPTER V.,"Of insolent life that rises from its streets,"
2267,CHAPTER V.,"The pulse of sin which ever beats and beats,"
2268,CHAPTER V.,"Wearying the ears of God. O Paris, Paris!"
2269,CHAPTER V.,What doom is thine for every soul that tarries
2270,CHAPTER V.,"Too long with thee, a stranger in thy arms."
2271,CHAPTER V.,"Thy smiles are incantations, thy brave charms"
2272,CHAPTER V.,"Death to thy lovers. Each gay mother's son,"
2273,CHAPTER V.,"Smitten with love for thee, is straight undone."
2274,CHAPTER V.,And lo the chariot wheels upon thy ways!
2275,CHAPTER V.,And a new garland hung in _Père la Chaise_!
2276,CHAPTER V.,
2277,CHAPTER V.,"Poor soul! I turned and looked into the night,"
2278,CHAPTER V.,"Through the uncurtained windows, and there bright"
2279,CHAPTER V.,Saw the mute twinkle of a thousand stars.
2280,CHAPTER V.,"One night! the least in all time's calendars,"
2281,CHAPTER V.,Yet fraught with what a meaning for this one!
2282,CHAPTER V.,"One star, the least of all that million!"
2283,CHAPTER V.,One room in that one city! Yet for him
2284,CHAPTER V.,The universe there was of space and time.
2285,CHAPTER V.,"What were his thoughts? In that chaotic soul,"
2286,CHAPTER V.,"Home of sad jests, obscene, unbeautiful,"
2287,CHAPTER V.,"Mired with the earthiest of brute desires,"
2288,CHAPTER V.,"And lit to sentience only with lewd fires,"
2289,CHAPTER V.,"Was there no secret, undisturbed, fair place"
2290,CHAPTER V.,Watered with love and favoured with God's grace
2291,CHAPTER V.,To which the wounded consciousness had fled
2292,CHAPTER V.,For its last refuge from a world of dread?
2293,CHAPTER V.,"Was his soul touched to tenderness, to awe,"
2294,CHAPTER V.,To softer recollection? All we saw
2295,CHAPTER V.,"Was the maimed body gasping forth its breath,"
2296,CHAPTER V.,"A rigid setting of the silent teeth,"
2297,CHAPTER V.,And the hands trembling. Death was with us there.
2298,CHAPTER V.,But where was he--O Heaven of pity! where?
2299,CHAPTER V.,
2300,CHAPTER V.,"We watched till morning by the dying man,"
2301,CHAPTER V.,"She weeping silently, I grieved and wan,"
2302,CHAPTER V.,And still he moved not. But with the first break
2303,CHAPTER V.,Of day in the window panes we saw him make
2304,CHAPTER V.,A sign as if of speaking. Pressing near--
2305,CHAPTER V.,"For his lips moved, Griselda deemed, in prayer--"
2306,CHAPTER V.,"We heard him make profession of his faith,"
2307,CHAPTER V.,"As a man of pleasure face to face with death,"
2308,CHAPTER V.,"A kind of gambler's Athanasian Creed,"
2309,CHAPTER V.,Repeated at the hour of his last need.
2310,CHAPTER V.,"""Five sovereigns,"" said he, steadying his will,"
2311,CHAPTER V.,"As in defiance of death's power to kill,"
2312,CHAPTER V.,"And with that smile of a superior mind,"
2313,CHAPTER V.,"Which was his strength in dealing with mankind,"
2314,CHAPTER V.,The world of sporting jargon and gay livers.
2315,CHAPTER V.,"""Five sovereigns is a fiver, and five fivers"
2316,CHAPTER V.,"A pony, and five ponies are a hundred--"
2317,CHAPTER V.,"No, four,"" he added, seeing he had blundered."
2318,CHAPTER V.,"""_Four_ to the hundred and _five_ centuries"
2319,CHAPTER V.,"Make up the monkey."" From his dying eyes"
2320,CHAPTER V.,"The smile of triumph faded. ""There, I've done it,"""
2321,CHAPTER V.,"He said, ""but there was no great odds upon it,"
2322,CHAPTER V.,"You see with a broken back."""
2323,CHAPTER V.,
2324,CHAPTER V.,"He spoke no more,"
2325,CHAPTER V.,And in another hour had passed the door
2326,CHAPTER V.,Which shuts the living from eternity.
2327,CHAPTER V.,"Where was he? God of pity, where was he?"
2328,CHAPTER V.,
2329,CHAPTER V.,This was the end of Lady L.'s romance.
2330,CHAPTER V.,
2331,CHAPTER V.,"When we had buried him, as they do in France,"
2332,CHAPTER V.,"In a tomb inscribed ""_à perpétuité_"""
2333,CHAPTER V.,"(Formally rented till the Judgment Day),"
2334,CHAPTER V.,"She put off black, and shed no further tears;"
2335,CHAPTER V.,"Her face for the first time showed all its years,"
2336,CHAPTER V.,But not a trace beyond. Without demur
2337,CHAPTER V.,"She gave adhesion to my plans for her,"
2338,CHAPTER V.,"And we went home to London and Lord L.,"
2339,CHAPTER V.,"Silent together, by the next night's mail."
2340,CHAPTER V.,She had been six weeks away.
2341,CHAPTER V.,
2342,CHAPTER V.,The interview
2343,CHAPTER V.,"Between them was dramatic. I, who knew"
2344,CHAPTER V.,"Her whole mad secret, and had seen her soul"
2345,CHAPTER V.,"Stripped of its covering, and without control,"
2346,CHAPTER V.,"Bowed down by circumstance and galled with shame,"
2347,CHAPTER V.,"Yielding to wounds and griefs without a name,"
2348,CHAPTER V.,Had feared for her a wild unhappy scene.
2349,CHAPTER V.,"I held Lord L. for the least stern of men,"
2350,CHAPTER V.,And yet I dared not hope even he would crave
2351,CHAPTER V.,No explanation e'er he quite forgave.
2352,CHAPTER V.,
2353,CHAPTER V.,"I was with them when they met, unwilling third,"
2354,CHAPTER V.,In their mute bandying of the unspoken word.
2355,CHAPTER V.,Lord L. essayed to speak. I saw his face
2356,CHAPTER V.,Made up for a high act of tragic grace
2357,CHAPTER V.,"As he came forward. It was grave and mild,"
2358,CHAPTER V.,"A father's welcoming a truant child,"
2359,CHAPTER V.,"Forgiving, yet intent to mark the pain"
2360,CHAPTER V.,"With hope ""the thing should not occur again."""
2361,CHAPTER V.,His lips began to move as to some speech
2362,CHAPTER V.,"Framed in this sense, as one might gently preach"
2363,CHAPTER V.,A word in season to too gadding wives
2364,CHAPTER V.,"Of duties owed, at least by those whose lives"
2365,CHAPTER V.,Moved in high places. But it died unsaid.
2366,CHAPTER V.,There was that about Griselda that forbade
2367,CHAPTER V.,Marital questionings. Her queenly eyes
2368,CHAPTER V.,"Met his with a mute answer of surprise,"
2369,CHAPTER V.,Marking the unseemliness of all display
2370,CHAPTER V.,"More strongly than with words, as who should say"
2371,CHAPTER V.,"_Noblesse oblige._ She took his outstretched hand,"
2372,CHAPTER V.,"And kissed his cheek, but would not understand"
2373,CHAPTER V.,"A word of his reproaches. Even I,"
2374,CHAPTER V.,"With my full knowledge and no more a boy,"
2375,CHAPTER V.,"But versed by years in the world's wickedness,"
2376,CHAPTER V.,"And open-eyed to her, alas! no less"
2377,CHAPTER V.,"Than to all womanhood, even I felt shame,"
2378,CHAPTER V.,And half absolved her in my mind from blame.
2379,CHAPTER V.,"And he, how could he less? He was but human,"
2380,CHAPTER V.,The fortunate husband of how fair a woman!
2381,CHAPTER V.,He stammered his excuses.
2382,CHAPTER V.,
2383,CHAPTER V.,What she told
2384,CHAPTER V.,When I had left them (since all coin is gold
2385,CHAPTER V.,"To those who would believe, and who the key"
2386,CHAPTER V.,"Hold of their eyes, in blind faith's alchemy)"
2387,CHAPTER V.,I never learned.
2388,CHAPTER V.,
2389,CHAPTER V.,"I did not linger on,"
2390,CHAPTER V.,"Seeing her peril past and the day won,"
2391,CHAPTER V.,But took my leave. She led me to the door
2392,CHAPTER V.,"With her old kindness of the days of yore,"
2393,CHAPTER V.,And thanked me as one thanks for little things.
2394,CHAPTER V.,"""You have been,"" she said, ""an angel without wings,"
2395,CHAPTER V.,"And I shall not forget,--nor will Lord L.;"
2396,CHAPTER V.,"And yet,"" she said, with an imperceptible"
2397,CHAPTER V.,"Change in her voice, ""there are things the world will say"
2398,CHAPTER V.,"Which are neither just nor kind, and, if to-day"
2399,CHAPTER V.,"We part awhile, remember we are friends,"
2400,CHAPTER V.,"If not now later. Time will make amends,"
2401,CHAPTER V.,"And we shall meet again."" I pressed her hand"
2402,CHAPTER V.,"A moment to my lips. ""I understand,"""
2403,CHAPTER V.,"I said, and gazed a last time in her eyes;"
2404,CHAPTER V.,"""Say all you will. I am your sacrifice."""
2405,CHAPTER V.,
2406,CHAPTER V.,"And so, in truth, it was. Henceforth there lay"
2407,CHAPTER V.,"A gulf between us, widening with delay,"
2408,CHAPTER V.,"And which our souls were impotent to pass,"
2409,CHAPTER V.,"The gulf of a dead secret; and, alas!"
2410,CHAPTER V.,"Who knows what subtle treacheries within,"
2411,CHAPTER V.,"For virtue rends its witnesses of sin,"
2412,CHAPTER V.,And hearts are strangely fashioned by their fears.
2413,CHAPTER V.,"We met no more in friendship through the years,"
2414,CHAPTER V.,"Although I held her secret as my own,"
2415,CHAPTER V.,"And fought her battles, her best champion,"
2416,CHAPTER V.,"On many a stricken field in scandal's war,"
2417,CHAPTER V.,Till all was well forgotten. From afar
2418,CHAPTER V.,"I watched her fortunes still with tenderness,"
2419,CHAPTER V.,"Yet sadly, as cast out of Paradise."
2420,CHAPTER V.,"For ever, spite her promise, from that day,"
2421,CHAPTER V.,"When I met L., he looked another way;"
2422,CHAPTER V.,"And she, Griselda, was reserved and chill."
2423,CHAPTER V.,"I had behaved, her women friends said, ill,"
2424,CHAPTER V.,"And caused a needless scandal in her life,"
2425,CHAPTER V.,"--They told not what. Enough, that as a wife"
2426,CHAPTER V.,"She had been compelled to close her doors on me,"
2427,CHAPTER V.,And that her lord knew all the iniquity.
2428,CHAPTER V.,
2429,CHAPTER V.,And so I bore the burden of her sin.
2430,CHAPTER V.,
2431,CHAPTER V.,What more shall I relate? The cynic vein
2432,CHAPTER V.,"Has overwhelmed my tale, and I must stop."
2433,CHAPTER V.,Its heroine lived to justify all hope
2434,CHAPTER V.,"Of her long-suffering lord, that out of pain"
2435,CHAPTER V.,"Blessings would grow, and his house smile again"
2436,CHAPTER V.,With the fulfilled expectance of an heir.
2437,CHAPTER V.,"Griselda sat no longer in despair,"
2438,CHAPTER V.,Nor wasted her full life on dreams of folly;
2439,CHAPTER V.,"She had little time for moods of melancholy,"
2440,CHAPTER V.,Or heart to venture further in love's ways;
2441,CHAPTER V.,"She was again the theme of all men's praise,"
2442,CHAPTER V.,"And suffered no man's passion. Once a year,"
2443,CHAPTER V.,"In the late autumn, when the leaves grew sere"
2444,CHAPTER V.,"She made retreat to a lay sisterhood,"
2445,CHAPTER V.,"And lived awhile there for her soul's more good,"
2446,CHAPTER V.,"In pious meditation, fasts and prayer."
2447,CHAPTER V.,Some say she wore concealed a shirt of hair
2448,CHAPTER V.,"Under her dresses, even at court balls,"
2449,CHAPTER V.,And certain 'tis that all Rome's rituals
2450,CHAPTER V.,Were followed daily at the private Mass
2451,CHAPTER V.,In her new chauntry built behind Hans Place.
2452,CHAPTER V.,"Lord L. approved of all she did, even this,"
2453,CHAPTER V.,Strange as it seemed to his old fashionedness.
2454,CHAPTER V.,
2455,CHAPTER V.,"He, gentle soul, grown garrulous with years,"
2456,CHAPTER V.,"Prosed of her virtues to all listeners,"
2457,CHAPTER V.,"And of their son's, the child of his old age,"
2458,CHAPTER V.,A prodigy of beauty and ways sage.
2459,CHAPTER V.,"It was a vow, he said, once made in Rome,"
2460,CHAPTER V.,Had brought them this chief treasure of their home.
2461,CHAPTER V.,A vow! The light world laughed--for miracles
