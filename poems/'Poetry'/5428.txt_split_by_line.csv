34,ON LOVE,
35,ON LOVE,"What is love? Ask him who lives, what is life? ask him who adores,"
36,ON LOVE,what is God?
37,ON LOVE,
38,ON LOVE,"I know not the internal constitution of other men, nor even thine,"
39,ON LOVE,whom I now address. I see that in some external attributes they
40,ON LOVE,"resemble me, but when, misled by that appearance, I have thought"
41,ON LOVE,"to appeal to something in common, and unburthen my inmost soul to"
42,ON LOVE,"them, I have found my language misunderstood, like one in a distant"
43,ON LOVE,and savage land. The more opportunities they have afforded me for
44,ON LOVE,"experience, the wider has appeared the interval between us, and"
45,ON LOVE,to a greater distance have the points of sympathy been withdrawn.
46,ON LOVE,"With a spirit ill fitted to sustain such proof, trembling and feeble"
47,ON LOVE,"through its tenderness, I have everywhere sought sympathy and have"
48,ON LOVE,found only repulse and disappointment.
49,ON LOVE,
50,ON LOVE,Thou demandest what is love? It is that powerful attraction towards
51,ON LOVE,"all that we conceive, or fear, or hope beyond ourselves, when we"
52,ON LOVE,"find within our own thoughts the chasm of an insufficient void,"
53,ON LOVE,"and seek to awaken in all things that are, a community with what we"
54,ON LOVE,"experience within ourselves. If we reason, we would be understood;"
55,ON LOVE,"if we imagine, we would that the airy children of our brain were"
56,ON LOVE,"born anew within another's; if we feel, we would that another's"
57,ON LOVE,"nerves should vibrate to our own, that the beams of their eyes"
58,ON LOVE,"should kindle at once and mix and melt into our own, that lips of"
59,ON LOVE,motionless ice should not reply to lips quivering and burning with
60,ON LOVE,the heart's best blood. This is Love. This is the bond and the
61,ON LOVE,"sanction which connects not only man with man, but with everything"
62,ON LOVE,"which exists. We are born into the world, and there is something"
63,ON LOVE,"within us which, from the instant that we live, more and more"
64,ON LOVE,thirsts after its likeness. It is probably in correspondence with
65,ON LOVE,this law that the infant drains milk from the bosom of its mother;
66,ON LOVE,this propensity develops itself with the development of our nature.
67,ON LOVE,We dimly see within our intellectual nature a miniature as it were
68,ON LOVE,"of our entire self, yet deprived of all that we condemn or despise,"
69,ON LOVE,the ideal prototype of everything excellent or lovely that we are
70,ON LOVE,capable of conceiving as belonging to the nature of man. Not only
71,ON LOVE,"the portrait of our external being, but an assemblage of the minutest"
72,ON LOVE,particles of which our nature is composed;[Footnote: These words
73,ON LOVE,are ineffectual and metaphorical. Most words are so--No help!] a
74,ON LOVE,mirror whose surface reflects only the forms of purity and brightness;
75,ON LOVE,a soul within our soul that describes a circle around its proper
76,ON LOVE,"paradise, which pain, and sorrow, and evil dare not overleap. To"
77,ON LOVE,"this we eagerly refer all sensations, thirsting that they should"
78,ON LOVE,resemble or correspond with it. The discovery of its antitype; the
79,ON LOVE,meeting with an understanding capable of clearly estimating our own;
80,ON LOVE,an imagination which should enter into and seize upon the subtle
81,ON LOVE,and delicate peculiarities which we have delighted to cherish and
82,ON LOVE,"unfold in secret; with a frame whose nerves, like the chords of"
83,ON LOVE,"two exquisite lyres, strung to the accompaniment of one delightful"
84,ON LOVE,"voice, vibrate with the vibrations of our own; and of a combination"
85,ON LOVE,of all these in such proportion as the type within demands; this
86,ON LOVE,is the invisible and unattainable point to which Love tends; and
87,ON LOVE,"to attain which, it urges forth the powers of man to arrest the"
88,ON LOVE,"faintest shadow of that, without the possession of which there"
89,ON LOVE,is no rest nor respite to the heart over which it rules. Hence in
90,ON LOVE,"solitude, or in that deserted state when we are surrounded by human"
91,ON LOVE,"beings, and yet they sympathize not with us, we love the flowers,"
92,ON LOVE,"the grass, and the waters, and the sky. In the motion of the very"
93,ON LOVE,"leaves of spring, in the blue air, there is then found a secret"
94,ON LOVE,correspondence with our heart. There is eloquence in the tongueless
95,ON LOVE,"wind, and a melody in the flowing brooks and the rustling of the"
96,ON LOVE,"reeds beside them, which by their inconceivable relation to something"
97,ON LOVE,"within the soul, awaken the spirits to a dance of breathless"
98,ON LOVE,"rapture, and bring tears of mysterious tenderness to the eyes, like"
99,ON LOVE,"the enthusiasm of patriotic success, or the voice of one beloved"
100,ON LOVE,"singing to you alone. Sterne says that, if he were in a desert,"
101,ON LOVE,"he would love some cypress. So soon as this want or power is dead,"
102,ON LOVE,"man becomes the living sepulchre of himself, and what yet survives"
103,ON LOVE,is the mere husk of what once he was.

110,ON LIFE,
111,ON LIFE,"Life and the world, or whatever we call that which we are and feel,"
112,ON LIFE,is an astonishing thing. The mist of familiarity obscures from us
113,ON LIFE,the wonder of our being. We are struck with admiration at some of
114,ON LIFE,"its transient modifications, but it is itself the great miracle."
115,ON LIFE,"What are changes of empires, the wreck of dynasties, with the"
116,ON LIFE,opinions which supported them; what is the birth and the extinction
117,ON LIFE,of religious and of political systems to life? What are the revolutions
118,ON LIFE,"of the globe which we inhabit, and the operations of the elements"
119,ON LIFE,"of which it is composed, compared with life? What is the universe"
120,ON LIFE,"of stars, and suns, of which this inhabited earth is one, and their"
121,ON LIFE,"motions, and their destiny, compared with life? Life, the great"
122,ON LIFE,"miracle, we admire not, because it is so miraculous. It is well"
123,ON LIFE,that we are thus shielded by the familiarity of what is at once
124,ON LIFE,"so certain and so unfathomable, from an astonishment which would"
125,ON LIFE,otherwise absorb and overawe the functions of that which is its
126,ON LIFE,object.
127,ON LIFE,
128,ON LIFE,"If any artist, I do not say had executed, but had merely conceived"
129,ON LIFE,"in his mind the system of the sun, and the stars, and planets, they"
130,ON LIFE,"not existing, and had painted to us in words, or upon canvas, the"
131,ON LIFE,"spectacle now afforded by the nightly cope of heaven, and illustrated it"
132,ON LIFE,"by the wisdom of astronomy, great would be our admiration. Or had"
133,ON LIFE,"he imagined the scenery of this earth, the mountains, the seas,"
134,ON LIFE,"and the rivers; the grass, and the flowers, and the variety of"
135,ON LIFE,"the forms and masses of the leaves of the woods, and the colours"
136,ON LIFE,"which attend the setting and the rising sun, and the hues of the"
137,ON LIFE,"atmosphere, turbid or serene, these things not before existing,"
138,ON LIFE,"truly we should have been astonished, and it would not have been a"
139,ON LIFE,"vain boast to have said of such a man, 'Non merita nome di creatore,"
140,ON LIFE,se non Iddio ed il Poeta.' But now these things are looked on with
141,ON LIFE,"little wonder, and to be conscious of them with intense delight is"
142,ON LIFE,esteemed to be the distinguishing mark of a refined and extraordinary
143,ON LIFE,person. The multitude of men care not for them. It is thus with
144,ON LIFE,Life--that which includes all.
145,ON LIFE,
146,ON LIFE,"What is life? Thoughts and feelings arise, with or without our will,"
147,ON LIFE,"and we employ words to express them. We are born, and our birth is"
148,ON LIFE,"unremembered, and our infancy remembered but in fragments; we live"
149,ON LIFE,"on, and in living we lose the apprehension of life. How vain is it"
150,ON LIFE,to think that words can penetrate the mystery of our being! Rightly
151,ON LIFE,"used they may make evident our ignorance to ourselves, and this is"
152,ON LIFE,much. For what are we? Whence do we come? and whither do we go? Is
153,ON LIFE,"birth the commencement, is death the conclusion of our being? What"
154,ON LIFE,is birth and death?
155,ON LIFE,
156,ON LIFE,"The most refined abstractions of logic conduct to a view of life,"
157,ON LIFE,"which, though startling to the apprehension, is, in fact, that which"
158,ON LIFE,the habitual sense of its repeated combinations has extinguished
159,ON LIFE,"in us. It strips, as it were, the painted curtain from this scene"
160,ON LIFE,of things. I confess that I am one of those who are unable to refuse
161,ON LIFE,my assent to the conclusions of those philosophers who assert that
162,ON LIFE,nothing exists but as it is perceived.
163,ON LIFE,
164,ON LIFE,"It is a decision against which all our persuasions struggle, and we"
165,ON LIFE,must be long convicted before we can be convinced that the solid
166,ON LIFE,universe of external things is 'such stuff as dreams are made
167,ON LIFE,of.' The shocking absurdities of the popular philosophy of mind
168,ON LIFE,"and matter, its fatal consequences in morals, and their violent"
169,ON LIFE,"dogmatism concerning the source of all things, had early conducted"
170,ON LIFE,me to materialism. This materialism is a seducing system to young and
171,ON LIFE,"superficial minds. It allows its disciples to talk, and dispenses"
172,ON LIFE,them from thinking. But I was discontented with such a view of
173,ON LIFE,"things as it afforded; man is a being of high aspirations, 'looking"
174,ON LIFE,"both before and after,' whose 'thoughts wander through eternity,'"
175,ON LIFE,disclaiming alliance with transience and decay; incapable of
176,ON LIFE,imagining to himself annihilation; existing but in the future and
177,ON LIFE,"the past; being, not what he is, but what he has been and shall be."
178,ON LIFE,"Whatever may be his true and final destination, there is a spirit"
179,ON LIFE,within him at enmity with nothingness and dissolution. This is the
180,ON LIFE,character of all life and being. Each is at once the centre and
181,ON LIFE,"the circumference; the point to which all things are referred, and"
182,ON LIFE,the line in which all things are contained. Such contemplations as
183,ON LIFE,"these, materialism and the popular philosophy of mind and matter"
184,ON LIFE,alike forbid; they are only consistent with the intellectual system.
185,ON LIFE,
186,ON LIFE,It is absurd to enter into a long recapitulation of arguments
187,ON LIFE,"sufficiently familiar to those inquiring minds, whom alone a writer"
188,ON LIFE,on abstruse subjects can be conceived to address. Perhaps the most
189,ON LIFE,clear and vigorous statement of the intellectual system is to be
190,ON LIFE,found in Sir William Drummond's Academical Questions.
191,ON LIFE,
192,ON LIFE,"After such an exposition, it would be idle to translate into other"
193,ON LIFE,words what could only lose its energy and fitness by the change.
194,ON LIFE,"Examined point by point, and word by word, the most discriminating"
195,ON LIFE,intellects have been able to discern no train of thoughts in the
196,ON LIFE,"process of reasoning, which does not conduct inevitably to the"
197,ON LIFE,conclusion which has been stated.
198,ON LIFE,
199,ON LIFE,"What follows from the admission? It establishes no new truth, it"
200,ON LIFE,"gives us no additional insight into our hidden nature, neither its"
201,ON LIFE,"action nor itself. Philosophy, impatient as it may be to build,"
202,ON LIFE,"has much work yet remaining, as pioneer for the overgrowth of ages."
203,ON LIFE,"It makes one step towards this object; it destroys error, and the"
204,ON LIFE,"roots of error. It leaves, what it is too often the duty of the"
205,ON LIFE,"reformer in political and ethical questions to leave, a vacancy."
206,ON LIFE,"It reduces the mind to that freedom in which it would have acted,"
207,ON LIFE,"but for the misuse of words and signs, the instruments of its own"
208,ON LIFE,"creation. By signs, I would be understood in a wide sense, including"
209,ON LIFE,"what is properly meant by that term, and what I peculiarly mean. In"
210,ON LIFE,"this latter sense, almost all familiar objects are signs, standing,"
211,ON LIFE,"not for themselves, but for others, in their capacity of suggesting"
212,ON LIFE,one thought which shall lead to a train of thoughts. Our whole life
213,ON LIFE,is thus an education of error.
214,ON LIFE,
215,ON LIFE,Let us recollect our sensations as children. What a distinct and
216,ON LIFE,intense apprehension had we of the world and of ourselves! Many of
217,ON LIFE,the circumstances of social life were then important to us which
218,ON LIFE,are now no longer so. But that is not the point of comparison on
219,ON LIFE,which I mean to insist. We less habitually distinguished all that
220,ON LIFE,"we saw and felt, from ourselves. They seemed as it were to constitute"
221,ON LIFE,"one mass. There are some persons who, in this respect, are always"
222,ON LIFE,"children. Those who are subject to the state called reverie, feel"
223,ON LIFE,"as if their nature were dissolved into the surrounding universe,"
224,ON LIFE,or as if the surrounding universe were absorbed into their being.
225,ON LIFE,They are conscious of no distinction. And these are states which
226,ON LIFE,"precede, or accompany, or follow an unusually intense and vivid"
227,ON LIFE,"apprehension of life. As men grow up this power commonly decays,"
228,ON LIFE,and they become mechanical and habitual agents. Thus feelings and
229,ON LIFE,then reasonings are the combined result of a multitude of entangled
230,ON LIFE,"thoughts, and of a series of what are called impressions, planted"
231,ON LIFE,by reiteration.
232,ON LIFE,
233,ON LIFE,The view of life presented by the most refined deductions of the
234,ON LIFE,"intellectual philosophy, is that of unity. Nothing exists but as"
235,ON LIFE,it is perceived. The difference is merely nominal between those two
236,ON LIFE,"classes of thought, which are vulgarly distinguished by the names"
237,ON LIFE,of ideas and of external objects. Pursuing the same thread of
238,ON LIFE,"reasoning, the existence of distinct individual minds, similar to"
239,ON LIFE,"that which is employed in now questioning its own nature, is likewise"
240,ON LIFE,"found to be a delusion. The words _I_, YOU, THEY, are not signs of"
241,ON LIFE,any actual difference subsisting between the assemblage of thoughts
242,ON LIFE,"thus indicated, but are merely marks employed to denote the different"
243,ON LIFE,modifications of the one mind.
244,ON LIFE,
245,ON LIFE,Let it not be supposed that this doctrine conducts to the monstrous
246,ON LIFE,"presumption that I, the person who now write and think, am that one"
247,ON LIFE,"mind. I am but a portion of it. The words _I_, and YOU, and THEY,"
248,ON LIFE,"are grammatical devices invented simply for arrangement, and totally"
249,ON LIFE,devoid of the intense and exclusive sense usually attached to
250,ON LIFE,them. It is difficult to find terms adequate to express so subtle
251,ON LIFE,a conception as that to which the Intellectual Philosophy has
252,ON LIFE,"conducted us. We are on that verge where words abandon us, and what"
253,ON LIFE,wonder if we grow dizzy to look down the dark abyss of how little
254,ON LIFE,"we know. The relations of THINGS remain unchanged, by whatever system."
255,ON LIFE,"By the word THINGS is to be understood any object of thought, that"
256,ON LIFE,"is any thought upon which any other thought is employed, with an"
257,ON LIFE,apprehension of distinction.
258,ON LIFE,
259,ON LIFE,The relations of these remain unchanged; and such is the material
260,ON LIFE,"of our knowledge. What is the cause of life? that is, how was it"
261,ON LIFE,"produced, or what agencies distinct from life have acted or act"
262,ON LIFE,upon life? All recorded generations of mankind have weariedly busied
263,ON LIFE,themselves in inventing answers to this question; and the result
264,ON LIFE,"has been,--Religion. Yet, that the basis of all things cannot be,"
265,ON LIFE,"as the popular philosophy alleges, mind, is sufficiently evident."
266,ON LIFE,"Mind, as far as we have any experience of its properties, and beyond"
267,ON LIFE,"that experience how vain is argument! cannot create, it can only"
268,ON LIFE,perceive. It is said also to be the cause. But cause is only a
269,ON LIFE,word expressing a certain state of the human mind with regard to
270,ON LIFE,the manner in which two thoughts are apprehended to be related to
271,ON LIFE,each other. If any one desires to know how unsatisfactorily the
272,ON LIFE,"popular philosophy employs itself upon this great question, they"
273,ON LIFE,need only impartially reflect upon the manner in which thoughts
274,ON LIFE,develop themselves in their minds. It is infinitely improbable that
275,ON LIFE,"the cause of mind, that is, of existence, is similar to mind."

282,ON A FUTURE STATE,ON A FUTURE STATE
283,ON A FUTURE STATE,
284,ON A FUTURE STATE,It has been the persuasion of an immense majority of human beings
285,ON A FUTURE STATE,"in all ages and nations that we continue to live after death,--that"
286,ON A FUTURE STATE,apparent termination of all the functions of sensitive and intellectual
287,ON A FUTURE STATE,existence. Nor has mankind been contented with supposing that
288,ON A FUTURE STATE,"species of existence which some philosophers have asserted; namely,"
289,ON A FUTURE STATE,the resolution of the component parts of the mechanism of a living
290,ON A FUTURE STATE,"being into its elements, and the impossibility of the minutest"
291,ON A FUTURE STATE,particle of these sustaining the smallest diminution. They have
292,ON A FUTURE STATE,"clung to the idea that sensibility and thought, which they have"
293,ON A FUTURE STATE,"distinguished from the objects of it, under the several names"
294,ON A FUTURE STATE,"of spirit and matter, is, in its own nature, less susceptible of"
295,ON A FUTURE STATE,"division and decay, and that, when the body is resolved into its"
296,ON A FUTURE STATE,"elements, the principle which animated it will remain perpetual"
297,ON A FUTURE STATE,and unchanged.  Some philosophers-and those to whom we are indebted
298,ON A FUTURE STATE,"for the most stupendous discoveries in physical science, suppose,"
299,ON A FUTURE STATE,"on the other hand, that intelligence is the mere result of certain"
300,ON A FUTURE STATE,combinations among the particles of its objects; and those among
301,ON A FUTURE STATE,"them who believe that we live after death, recur to the interposition"
302,ON A FUTURE STATE,"of a supernatural power, which shall overcome the tendency inherent"
303,ON A FUTURE STATE,"in all material combinations, to dissipate and be absorbed into"
304,ON A FUTURE STATE,other forms.
305,ON A FUTURE STATE,
306,ON A FUTURE STATE,Let us trace the reasonings which in one and the other have conducted
307,ON A FUTURE STATE,"to these two opinions, and endeavour to discover what we ought to"
308,ON A FUTURE STATE,think on a question of such momentous interest. Let us analyse the
309,ON A FUTURE STATE,"ideas and feelings which constitute the contending beliefs, and"
310,ON A FUTURE STATE,watchfully establish a discrimination between words and thoughts.
311,ON A FUTURE STATE,Let us bring the question to the test of experience and fact; and
312,ON A FUTURE STATE,"ask ourselves, considering our nature in its entire extent, what"
313,ON A FUTURE STATE,light we derive from a sustained and comprehensive view of its
314,ON A FUTURE STATE,"component parts, which may enable, us to assert, with certainty,"
315,ON A FUTURE STATE,that we do or do not live after death.
316,ON A FUTURE STATE,
317,ON A FUTURE STATE,The examination of this subject requires that it should be stript
318,ON A FUTURE STATE,of all those accessory topics which adhere to it in the common opinion
319,ON A FUTURE STATE,"of men. The existence of a God, and a future state of rewards and"
320,ON A FUTURE STATE,"punishments, are totally foreign to the subject. If it be proved"
321,ON A FUTURE STATE,"that the world is ruled by a Divine Power, no inference necessarily"
322,ON A FUTURE STATE,can be drawn from that circumstance in favour of a future state.
323,ON A FUTURE STATE,"It has been asserted, indeed, that as goodness and justice are to"
324,ON A FUTURE STATE,"be numbered among the attributes of the Deity, He will undoubtedly"
325,ON A FUTURE STATE,"compensate the virtuous who suffer during life, and that He will"
326,ON A FUTURE STATE,"make every sensitive being who does not deserve punishment, happy"
327,ON A FUTURE STATE,"for ever. But this view of the subject, which it would be tedious"
328,ON A FUTURE STATE,"as well as superfluous to develop and expose, satisfies no person,"
329,ON A FUTURE STATE,"and cuts the knot which we now seek to untie. Moreover, should it"
330,ON A FUTURE STATE,"be proved, on the other hand, that the mysterious principle which"
331,ON A FUTURE STATE,"regulates the proceedings of the universe, is neither intelligent"
332,ON A FUTURE STATE,"nor sensitive, yet it is not an inconsistency to suppose at the"
333,ON A FUTURE STATE,"same time, that the animating power survives the body which it"
334,ON A FUTURE STATE,"has animated, by laws as independent of any supernatural agent as"
335,ON A FUTURE STATE,"those through which it first became united with it. Nor, if a future"
336,ON A FUTURE STATE,"state be clearly proved, does it follow that it will be a state of"
337,ON A FUTURE STATE,punishment or reward.
338,ON A FUTURE STATE,
339,ON A FUTURE STATE,"By the word death, we express that condition in which natures"
340,ON A FUTURE STATE,resembling ourselves apparently cease to be that which they were.
341,ON A FUTURE STATE,"We no longer hear them speak, nor see them move. If they have"
342,ON A FUTURE STATE,"sensations and apprehensions, we no longer participate in them."
343,ON A FUTURE STATE,"We know no more than that those external organs, and all that fine"
344,ON A FUTURE STATE,"texture of material frame, without which we have no experience that"
345,ON A FUTURE STATE,"life or thought can subsist, are dissolved and scattered abroad."
346,ON A FUTURE STATE,"The body is placed under the earth, and after a certain period there"
347,ON A FUTURE STATE,remains no vestige even of its form. This is that contemplation
348,ON A FUTURE STATE,"of inexhaustible melancholy, whose shadow eclipses the brightness"
349,ON A FUTURE STATE,of the world. The common observer is struck with dejection at the
350,ON A FUTURE STATE,"spectacle. He contends in vain against the persuasion of the grave,"
351,ON A FUTURE STATE,that the dead indeed cease to be. The corpse at his feet is prophetic
352,ON A FUTURE STATE,"of his own destiny. Those who have preceded him, and whose voice"
353,ON A FUTURE STATE,was delightful to his ear; whose touch met his like sweet and subtle
354,ON A FUTURE STATE,fire; whose aspect spread a visionary light upon his path--these
355,ON A FUTURE STATE,"he cannot meet again. The organs of sense are destroyed, and the"
356,ON A FUTURE STATE,intellectual operations dependent on them have perished with their
357,ON A FUTURE STATE,"sources. How can a corpse see or feel? its eyes are eaten out, and"
358,ON A FUTURE STATE,its heart is black and without motion. What intercourse can two
359,ON A FUTURE STATE,heaps of putrid clay and crumbling bones hold together? When you
360,ON A FUTURE STATE,"can discover where the fresh colours of the faded flower abide,"
361,ON A FUTURE STATE,"or the music of the broken lyre, seek life among the dead. Such"
362,ON A FUTURE STATE,"are the anxious and fearful contemplations of the common observer,"
363,ON A FUTURE STATE,though the popular religion often prevents him from confessing them
364,ON A FUTURE STATE,even to himself.
365,ON A FUTURE STATE,
366,ON A FUTURE STATE,"The natural philosopher, in addition to the sensations common"
367,ON A FUTURE STATE,"to all men inspired by the event of death, believes that he sees"
368,ON A FUTURE STATE,with more certainty that it is attended with the annihilation of
369,ON A FUTURE STATE,sentiment and thought. He observes the mental powers increase and
370,ON A FUTURE STATE,"fade with those of the body, and even accommodate themselves to"
371,ON A FUTURE STATE,the most transitory changes of our physical nature. Sleep suspends
372,ON A FUTURE STATE,many of the faculties of the vital and intellectual principle;
373,ON A FUTURE STATE,drunkenness and disease will either temporarily or permanently
374,ON A FUTURE STATE,derange them. Madness or idiotcy may utterly extinguish the most
375,ON A FUTURE STATE,excellent and delicate of those powers. In old age the mind gradually
376,ON A FUTURE STATE,"withers; and as it grew and was strengthened with the body, so does"
377,ON A FUTURE STATE,it together with the body sink into decrepitude. Assuredly these
378,ON A FUTURE STATE,are convincing evidences that so soon as the organs of the body
379,ON A FUTURE STATE,"are subjected to the laws of inanimate matter, sensation, and"
380,ON A FUTURE STATE,"perception, and apprehension, are at an end.  It is probable that"
381,ON A FUTURE STATE,"what we call thought is not an actual being, but no more than the"
382,ON A FUTURE STATE,"relation between certain parts of that infinitely varied mass,"
383,ON A FUTURE STATE,"of which the rest of the universe is composed, and which ceases"
384,ON A FUTURE STATE,to exist so soon as those parts change their position with regard
385,ON A FUTURE STATE,"to each other. Thus colour, and sound, and taste, and odour exist"
386,ON A FUTURE STATE,only relatively. But let thought be considered as some peculiar
387,ON A FUTURE STATE,"substance, which permeates, and is the cause of, the animation of"
388,ON A FUTURE STATE,living beings. Why should that substance be assumed to be something
389,ON A FUTURE STATE,"essentially distinct from all others, and exempt from subjection"
390,ON A FUTURE STATE,"to those laws from which no other substance is exempt? It differs,"
391,ON A FUTURE STATE,"indeed, from all other substances, as electricity, and light, and"
392,ON A FUTURE STATE,"magnetism, and the constituent parts of air and earth, severally"
393,ON A FUTURE STATE,differ from all others. Each of these is subject to change and
394,ON A FUTURE STATE,"to decay, and to conversion into other forms. Yet the difference"
395,ON A FUTURE STATE,between light and earth is scarcely greater than that which exists
396,ON A FUTURE STATE,"between life, or thought, and fire. The difference between the two"
397,ON A FUTURE STATE,former was never alleged as an argument for the eternal permanence
398,ON A FUTURE STATE,"of either, in that form under which they first might offer themselves"
399,ON A FUTURE STATE,to our notice. Why should the difference between the two latter
400,ON A FUTURE STATE,substances be an argument for the prolongation of the existence
401,ON A FUTURE STATE,"of one and not the other, when the existence of both has arrived"
402,ON A FUTURE STATE,at their apparent termination? To say that fire exists without
403,ON A FUTURE STATE,"manifesting any of the properties of fire, such as light, heat,"
404,ON A FUTURE STATE,"etc., or that the principle of life exists without consciousness,"
405,ON A FUTURE STATE,"or memory, or desire, or motive, is to resign, by an awkward"
406,ON A FUTURE STATE,"distortion of language, the affirmative of the dispute. To say"
407,ON A FUTURE STATE,that the principle of life MAY exist in distribution among various
408,ON A FUTURE STATE,"forms, is to assert what cannot be proved to be either true or"
409,ON A FUTURE STATE,"false, but which, were it true, annihilates all hope of existence"
410,ON A FUTURE STATE,"after death, in any sense in which that event can belong to the"
411,ON A FUTURE STATE,"hopes and fears of men. Suppose, however, that the intellectual"
412,ON A FUTURE STATE,and vital principle differs in the most marked and essential manner
413,ON A FUTURE STATE,from all other known substances; that they have all some resemblance
414,ON A FUTURE STATE,between themselves which it in no degree participates.  In what manner
415,ON A FUTURE STATE,can this concession be made an argument for its imperishability?
416,ON A FUTURE STATE,All that we see or know perishes and is changed.  Life and thought
417,ON A FUTURE STATE,differ indeed from everything else. But that it survives that
418,ON A FUTURE STATE,"period, beyond which we have no experience of its existence, such"
419,ON A FUTURE STATE,"distinction and dissimilarity affords no shadow of proof, and nothing"
420,ON A FUTURE STATE,but our own desires could have led us to conjecture or imagine.
421,ON A FUTURE STATE,Have we existed before birth? It is difficult to conceive the
422,ON A FUTURE STATE,"possibility of this. There is, in the generative principle of each"
423,ON A FUTURE STATE,"animal and plant, a power which converts the substances by which"
424,ON A FUTURE STATE,it is surrounded into a substance homogeneous with itself. That
425,ON A FUTURE STATE,"is, the relations between certain elementary particles of matter"
426,ON A FUTURE STATE,"undergo a change, and submit to new combinations. For when we use"
427,ON A FUTURE STATE,"the words PRINCIPLE, POWER, CAUSE, we mean to express no real being,"
428,ON A FUTURE STATE,but only to class under those terms a certain series of co-existing
429,ON A FUTURE STATE,phenomena; but let it be supposed that this principle is a certain
430,ON A FUTURE STATE,substance which escapes the observation of the chemist and anatomist.
431,ON A FUTURE STATE,It certainly MAY BE; though it is sufficiently unphilosophical
432,ON A FUTURE STATE,to allege the possibility of an opinion as a proof of its truth.
433,ON A FUTURE STATE,"Does it see, hear, feel, before its combination with those organs"
434,ON A FUTURE STATE,"on which sensation depends? Does it reason, imagine, apprehend,"
435,ON A FUTURE STATE,without those ideas which sensation alone can communicate? If we
436,ON A FUTURE STATE,"have not existed before birth; if, at the period when the parts"
437,ON A FUTURE STATE,"of our nature on which thought and life depend, seem to be woven"
438,ON A FUTURE STATE,together; if there are no reasons to suppose that we have existed
439,ON A FUTURE STATE,"before that period at which our existence apparently commences,"
440,ON A FUTURE STATE,then there are no grounds for supposition that we shall continue
441,ON A FUTURE STATE,to exist after our existence has apparently ceased.  So far as
442,ON A FUTURE STATE,"thought is concerned, the same will take place with regard to use,"
443,ON A FUTURE STATE,"individually considered, after death, as had place before our birth."
444,ON A FUTURE STATE,
445,ON A FUTURE STATE,"It is said that it, is possible that we should continue to exist"
446,ON A FUTURE STATE,in some mode totally inconceivable to us at present. This is a most
447,ON A FUTURE STATE,unreasonable presumption. It casts on the adherents of annihilation
448,ON A FUTURE STATE,"the burthen of proving the negative of a question, the affirmative"
449,ON A FUTURE STATE,"of which is not supported by a single argument, and which, by its"
450,ON A FUTURE STATE,"very nature, lies beyond the experience of the human understanding."
451,ON A FUTURE STATE,"It is sufficiently easy, indeed, to form any proposition, concerning"
452,ON A FUTURE STATE,"which we are ignorant, just not so absurd as not to be contradictory"
453,ON A FUTURE STATE,"in itself, and defy refutation. The possibility of whatever enters"
454,ON A FUTURE STATE,into the wildest imagination to conceive is thus triumphantly
455,ON A FUTURE STATE,vindicated. But it is enough that such assertions should be either
456,ON A FUTURE STATE,"contradictory to the known laws of nature, or exceed the limits of our"
457,ON A FUTURE STATE,"experience, that their fallacy or irrelevancy to our consideration"
458,ON A FUTURE STATE,"should be demonstrated. They persuade, indeed, only those who"
459,ON A FUTURE STATE,desire to be persuaded. This desire to be for ever as we are; the
460,ON A FUTURE STATE,"reluctance to a violent and unexperienced change, which is common"
461,ON A FUTURE STATE,"to all the animated and inanimate combinations of the universe, is,"
462,ON A FUTURE STATE,"indeed, the secret persuasion which has given birth to the opinions"
463,ON A FUTURE STATE,of a future state.

478,A FRAGMENT,"It is sufficiently clear that revenge, retaliation, atonement,"

481,A FRAGMENT,sources of a prodigious class of miseries in the domestic circles
482,A FRAGMENT,of society. It is clear that however the spirit of legislation may
483,A FRAGMENT,"appear to frame institutions upon more philosophical maxims, it"
484,A FRAGMENT,"has hitherto, in those cases which are termed criminal, done little"
485,A FRAGMENT,"more than palliate the spirit, by gratifying a portion of it; and"
486,A FRAGMENT,afforded a compromise between that which is bests--the inflicting
487,A FRAGMENT,"of no evil upon a sensitive being, without a decisively beneficial"

489,A FRAGMENT,worst; that he should be put to torture for the amusement of those

491,A FRAGMENT,

494,A FRAGMENT,"of indefinite shades of distinction, so soon as they shall have"

501,A FRAGMENT,"to think and feel after the dissolution of the body, has been the"
502,A FRAGMENT,"almost universal opinion of mankind, and the accurate philosophy"
503,A FRAGMENT,"of what I may be permitted to term the modern Academy, by showing"
504,A FRAGMENT,the prodigious depth and extent of our ignorance respecting the
505,A FRAGMENT,"causes and nature of sensation, renders probable the affirmative"
506,A FRAGMENT,"of a proposition, the negative of which it is so difficult to"
507,A FRAGMENT,"conceive, and the popular arguments against which, derived from"
508,A FRAGMENT,"what is called the atomic system, are proved to be applicable only"
509,A FRAGMENT,"to the relation which one object bears to another, as apprehended"

511,A FRAGMENT,essence which is the medium and receptacle of objects.

513,A FRAGMENT,"The popular system of religion suggests the idea that the mind,"
514,A FRAGMENT,"after death, will be painfully or pleasurably affected according to"
515,A FRAGMENT,its determinations during life. However ridiculous and pernicious
516,A FRAGMENT,"we must admit the vulgar accessories of this creed to be, there"
517,A FRAGMENT,"is a certain analogy, not wholly absurd, between the consequences"
518,A FRAGMENT,"resulting to an individual during life from the virtuous or vicious,"
519,A FRAGMENT,"prudent or imprudent, conduct of his external actions, to those"
520,A FRAGMENT,consequences which are conjectured to ensue from the discipline
521,A FRAGMENT,"and order of his internal thoughts, as affecting his condition in"
522,A FRAGMENT,"a future state. They omit, indeed, to calculate upon the accidents"
523,A FRAGMENT,"of disease, and temperament, and organization, and circumstance,"
524,A FRAGMENT,together with the multitude of independent agencies which affect
525,A FRAGMENT,"the opinions, the conduct, and the happiness of individuals, and"
526,A FRAGMENT,"produce determinations of the will, and modify the judgement, so"
527,A FRAGMENT,as to produce effects the most opposite in natures considerably
528,A FRAGMENT,similar. These are those operations in the order of the whole of
529,A FRAGMENT,"nature, tending, we are prone to believe, to some definite mighty"
530,A FRAGMENT,"end, to which the agencies of our peculiar nature are subordinate;"
531,A FRAGMENT,"nor is there any reason to suppose, that in a future state they should"
532,A FRAGMENT,become suddenly exempt from that subordination.  The philosopher is
533,A FRAGMENT,unable to determine whether our existence in a previous state has
534,A FRAGMENT,"affected our present condition, and abstains from deciding whether"
535,A FRAGMENT,our present condition will affect us in that which may be future.
536,A FRAGMENT,"That, if we continue to exist, the manner of our existence will be"
537,A FRAGMENT,"such as no inferences nor conjectures, afforded by a consideration"

539,A FRAGMENT,"The opinion that the vital principle within us, in whatever mode"
540,A FRAGMENT,"it may continue to exist, must lose that consciousness of definite"
541,A FRAGMENT,"and individual being which now characterizes it, and become a unit"
542,A FRAGMENT,in the vast sum of action and of thought which disposes and animates
543,A FRAGMENT,"the universe, and is called God, seems to belong to that class of"
544,A FRAGMENT,opinion which has been designated as indifferent.

546,A FRAGMENT,To compel a person to know all that can be known by the dead
547,A FRAGMENT,"concerning that which the living fear, hope, or forget; to plunge"
548,A FRAGMENT,him into the pleasure or pain which there awaits him; to punish or
549,A FRAGMENT,reward him in a manner and in a degree incalculable and incomprehensible
550,A FRAGMENT,by us; to disrobe him at once from all that intertexture of good
551,A FRAGMENT,and evil with which Nature seems to have clothed every form of
552,A FRAGMENT,"individual existence, is to inflict on him the doom of death."
553,A FRAGMENT,
554,A FRAGMENT,A certain degree of pain and terror usually accompany the infliction
555,A FRAGMENT,of death. This degree is infinitely varied by the infinite variety
556,A FRAGMENT,in the temperament and opinions of the sufferers.  As a measure of
557,A FRAGMENT,"punishment, strictly so considered, and as an exhibition, which, by"
558,A FRAGMENT,"its known effects on the sensibility of the sufferer, is intended"
559,A FRAGMENT,"to intimidate the spectators from incurring a similar liability,"
560,A FRAGMENT,it is singularly inadequate.
561,A FRAGMENT,
562,A FRAGMENT,"Firstly, Persons of energetic character, in whom, as in men who"
563,A FRAGMENT,"suffer for political crimes, there is a large mixture of enterprise,"
564,A FRAGMENT,"and fortitude, and disinterestedness, and the elements, though"
565,A FRAGMENT,"misguided and disarranged, by which the strength and happiness of a"
566,A FRAGMENT,"nation might have been cemented, die in such a manner, as to make"
567,A FRAGMENT,"death appear not evil, but good. The death of what is called a"
568,A FRAGMENT,"traitor, that is, a person who, from whatever motive, would abolish"
569,A FRAGMENT,"the government of the day, is as often a triumphant exhibition"
570,A FRAGMENT,"of suffering virtue, as the warning of a culprit. The multitude,"
571,A FRAGMENT,instead of departing with a panic-stricken approbation of the laws
572,A FRAGMENT,"which exhibited such a spectacle, are inspired with pity, admiration"
573,A FRAGMENT,and sympathy; and the most generous among them feel an emulation
574,A FRAGMENT,"to be the authors of such flattering emotions, as they experience"
575,A FRAGMENT,"stirring in their bosoms.  Impressed by what they see and feel,"
576,A FRAGMENT,they make no distinctive between the motives which incited the
577,A FRAGMENT,"criminals to the action for which they suffer, or the heroic courage"
578,A FRAGMENT,with which they turned into good that which their judges awarded
579,A FRAGMENT,"to them as evil or the purpose itself of those actions, though that"
580,A FRAGMENT,purpose may happen to be eminently pernicious. The laws in this
581,A FRAGMENT,"case lose their sympathy, which it ought to be their chief object"
582,A FRAGMENT,"to secure, and in a participation of which consists their chief"
583,A FRAGMENT,strength in maintaining those sanctions by which the parts of the
584,A FRAGMENT,"social union are bound together, so as to produce, as nearly as"
585,A FRAGMENT,"possible, the ends for which it is instituted."
586,A FRAGMENT,
587,A FRAGMENT,"Secondly,--Persons of energetic character, in communities not"
588,A FRAGMENT,modelled with philosophical skill to turn all the energies which
589,A FRAGMENT,"they contain to the purposes of common good, are prone also to fall"
590,A FRAGMENT,"into the temptation of undertaking, and are peculiarly fitted for"
591,A FRAGMENT,"despising the perils attendant upon consummating, the most enormous"
592,A FRAGMENT,"crimes. Murder, rapes, extensive schemes of plunder are the actions"
593,A FRAGMENT,of persons belonging to this class; and death is the penalty of
594,A FRAGMENT,"conviction. But the coarseness of organization, peculiar to men"
595,A FRAGMENT,"capable of committing acts wholly selfish, is usually found to"
596,A FRAGMENT,be associated with a proportionate insensibility to fear or pain.
597,A FRAGMENT,"Their sufferings communicate to those of the spectators, who may be"
598,A FRAGMENT,liable to the commission of similar crimes a sense of the lightness
599,A FRAGMENT,"of that event, when closely examined which, at a distance, as"
600,A FRAGMENT,"uneducated persons are accustomed to do, probably they regarded with"
601,A FRAGMENT,horror. But a great majority of the spectators are so bound up in
602,A FRAGMENT,the interests and the habits of social union that no temptation
603,A FRAGMENT,would be sufficiently strong to induce them to a commission of the
604,A FRAGMENT,"enormities to which this penalty is assigned. The more powerful, and"
605,A FRAGMENT,"the richer among them,--and a numerous class of little tradesmen are"
606,A FRAGMENT,"richer and more powerful than those who are employed by them, and"
607,A FRAGMENT,"the employer, in general, bears this relation to the employed,--regard"
608,A FRAGMENT,"their own wrongs as, in some degree, avenged, and their own rights"
609,A FRAGMENT,"secured by this punishment, inflicted as the penalty of whatever"
610,A FRAGMENT,"crime. In cases of murder or mutilation, this feeling is almost"
611,A FRAGMENT,"universal. In those, therefore, whom this exhibition does not"
612,A FRAGMENT,awaken to the sympathy which extenuates crime and discredits the
613,A FRAGMENT,"law which restrains it, it produces feelings more directly at war"
614,A FRAGMENT,with the genuine purposes of political society.  It excites those
615,A FRAGMENT,emotions which it is the chief object of civilization to extinguish
616,A FRAGMENT,"for ever, and in the extinction of which alone there can be any"
617,A FRAGMENT,hope of better institutions than those under which men now misgovern
618,A FRAGMENT,"one another. Men feel that their revenge is gratified, and that"
619,A FRAGMENT,their security is established by the extinction and the sufferings
620,A FRAGMENT,"of beings, in most respects resembling themselves; and their daily"
621,A FRAGMENT,"occupations constraining them to a precise form in all their thoughts,"
622,A FRAGMENT,they come to connect inseparably the idea of their own advantage
623,A FRAGMENT,with that of the death and torture of others. It is manifest that
624,A FRAGMENT,the object of sane polity is directly the reverse; and that laws
625,A FRAGMENT,"founded upon reason, should accustom the gross vulgar to associate"
626,A FRAGMENT,"their ideas of security and of interest with the reformation, and"
627,A FRAGMENT,"the strict restraint, for that purpose alone, of those who might"
628,A FRAGMENT,invade it.
629,A FRAGMENT,
630,A FRAGMENT,The passion of revenge is originally nothing more than an habitual
631,A FRAGMENT,perception of the ideas of the sufferings of the person who inflicts
632,A FRAGMENT,"an injury, as connected, as they are in a savage state, or in such"
633,A FRAGMENT,"portions of society as are yet undisciplined to civilization, with"
634,A FRAGMENT,security that that injury will not be repeated in future. This
635,A FRAGMENT,"feeling, engrafted upon superstition and confirmed by habit, at"
636,A FRAGMENT,last loses sight of the only object for which it may be supposed
637,A FRAGMENT,"to have been implanted, and becomes a passion and a duty to be"
638,A FRAGMENT,"pursued and fulfilled, even to the destruction of those ends to"
639,A FRAGMENT,"which it originally tended. The other passions, both good and evil."
640,A FRAGMENT,"Avarice, Remorse, Love, Patriotism, present a similar appearance;"
641,A FRAGMENT,and to this principle of the mind over-shooting the mark at which
642,A FRAGMENT,"it aims, we owe all that is eminently base or excellent in human"
643,A FRAGMENT,"nature; in providing for the nutriment or the extinction of which,"
644,A FRAGMENT,consists the true art of the legislator. [Footnote: The savage and
645,A FRAGMENT,the illiterate are but faintly aware of the distinction between
646,A FRAGMENT,the future and the past; they make actions belonging to periods so
647,A FRAGMENT,"distinct, the subjects of similar feelings; they live only in the"
648,A FRAGMENT,"present, or in the past, as it is present. It is in this that the"
649,A FRAGMENT,philosopher excels one of the many; it is this which distinguishes
650,A FRAGMENT,the doctrine of philosophic necessity from fatalism; and that
651,A FRAGMENT,"determination of the will, by which it is the active source of future"
652,A FRAGMENT,"events, from that liberty or indifference, to which the abstract"
653,A FRAGMENT,"liability of irremediable actions is attached, according to the"
654,A FRAGMENT,notions of the vulgar.
655,A FRAGMENT,
656,A FRAGMENT,This is the source of the erroneous excesses of Remorse and Revenge;
657,A FRAGMENT,"the one extending itself over the future, and the other over the"
658,A FRAGMENT,past; provinces in which their suggestions can only be the sources
659,A FRAGMENT,of evil. The purpose of a resolution to act more wisely and virtuously
660,A FRAGMENT,"in future, and the sense of a necessity of caution in repressing"
661,A FRAGMENT,"an enemy, are the sources from which the enormous superstitions"
662,A FRAGMENT,implied in the words cited have arisen.]
663,A FRAGMENT,
664,A FRAGMENT,Nothing is more clear than that the infliction of punishment in
665,A FRAGMENT,"general, in a degree which the reformation and the restraint of"
666,A FRAGMENT,"those who transgress the laws does not render indispensable, and"
667,A FRAGMENT,"none more than death, confirms all the inhuman and unsocial impulses"
668,A FRAGMENT,"of men. It is almost a proverbial remark, that those nations in which"
669,A FRAGMENT,"the penal code has been particularly mild, have been distinguished"
670,A FRAGMENT,from all others by the rarity of crime.  But the example is to be
671,A FRAGMENT,admitted to be equivocal. A more decisive argument is afforded by
672,A FRAGMENT,"a consideration of the universal connexion of ferocity of manners,"
673,A FRAGMENT,"and a contempt of social ties, with the contempt of human life."
674,A FRAGMENT,Governments which derive their institutions from the existence of
675,A FRAGMENT,"circumstances of barbarism and violence, with some rare exceptions"
676,A FRAGMENT,"perhaps, are bloody in proportion as they are despotic, and form"
677,A FRAGMENT,the manners of their subjects to a sympathy with their own spirit.
678,A FRAGMENT,
679,A FRAGMENT,"The spectators who feel no abhorrence at a public execution, but"
680,A FRAGMENT,"rather a self-applauding superiority, and a sense of gratified"
681,A FRAGMENT,"indignation, are surely excited to the most inauspicious emotions. The"
682,A FRAGMENT,first reflection of such a one is the sense of his own internal and
683,A FRAGMENT,"actual worth, as preferable to that of the victim, whom circumstances"
684,A FRAGMENT,have led to destruction. The meanest wretch is impressed with a
685,A FRAGMENT,sense of his own comparative merit. He is one of those on whom the
686,A FRAGMENT,tower of Siloam fell not--he is such a one as Jesus Christ found
687,A FRAGMENT,"not in all Samaria, who, in his own soul, throws the first stone at"
688,A FRAGMENT,the woman taken in adultery.  The popular religion of the country
689,A FRAGMENT,takes its designation from that illustrious person whose beautiful
690,A FRAGMENT,sentiment I have quoted.  Any one who has stript from the doctrines
691,A FRAGMENT,"of this person the veil of familiarity, will perceive how adverse"
692,A FRAGMENT,their spirit is to feelings of this nature.

724,I--THE MIND,"Thoughts, or ideas, or notions, call them what you will, differ"
725,I--THE MIND,"from each other, not in kind, but in force. It has commonly been"
726,I--THE MIND,supposed that those distinct thoughts which affect a number of
727,I--THE MIND,"persons, at regular intervals, during the passage of a multitude"
728,I--THE MIND,"of other thoughts, which are called REAL or EXTERNAL OBJECTS,"
729,I--THE MIND,are totally different in kind from those which affect only a few
730,I--THE MIND,"persons, and which recur at irregular intervals, and are usually"
731,I--THE MIND,"more obscure and indistinct, such as hallucinations, dreams, and the"
732,I--THE MIND,ideas of madness. No essential distinction between any one of these
733,I--THE MIND,"ideas, or any class of them, is founded on a correct observation of"
734,I--THE MIND,"the nature of things, but merely on a consideration of what thoughts"
735,I--THE MIND,are most invariably subservient to the security and happiness of
736,I--THE MIND,"life; and if nothing more were expressed by the distinction, the"
737,I--THE MIND,philosopher might safely accommodate his language to that of the
738,I--THE MIND,"vulgar. But they pretend to assert an essential difference, which"
739,I--THE MIND,"has no foundation in truth, and which suggests a narrow and false"
740,I--THE MIND,"conception of universal nature, the parent of the most fatal errors"
741,I--THE MIND,in speculation. A specific difference between every thought of the
742,I--THE MIND,"mind, is, indeed, a necessary consequence of that law by which it"
743,I--THE MIND,perceives diversity and number; but a generic and essential difference
744,I--THE MIND,is wholly arbitrary. The principle of the agreement and similarity
745,I--THE MIND,"of all thoughts, is, that they are all thoughts; the principle"
746,I--THE MIND,of their disagreement consists in the variety and irregularity of
747,I--THE MIND,the occasions on which they arise in the mind. That in which they
748,I--THE MIND,"agree, to that in which they differ, is as everything to nothing."
749,I--THE MIND,"Important distinctions, of various degrees of force, indeed, are to"
750,I--THE MIND,"be established between them, if they were, as they may be, subjects"
751,I--THE MIND,of ethical and economical discussion; but that is a question
752,I--THE MIND,altogether distinct. By considering all knowledge as bounded by
753,I--THE MIND,"perception, whose operations may be indefinitely combined, we arrive"
754,I--THE MIND,"at a conception of Nature inexpressibly more magnificent, simple"
755,I--THE MIND,"and true, than accords with the ordinary systems of complicated and"
756,I--THE MIND,"partial consideration. Nor does a contemplation of the universe,"
757,I--THE MIND,"in this comprehensive and synthetical view, exclude the subtlest"
758,I--THE MIND,analysis of its modifications and parts.
759,I--THE MIND,
760,I--THE MIND,"A scale might be formed, graduated according to the degrees"
761,I--THE MIND,"of a combined ratio of intensity, duration, connexion, periods of"
762,I--THE MIND,"recurrence, and utility, which would be the standard, according to"
763,I--THE MIND,"which all ideas might be measured, and an uninterrupted chain of"
764,I--THE MIND,"nicely shadowed distinctions would be observed, from the faintest"
765,I--THE MIND,"impression on the senses, to the most distinct combination of those"
766,I--THE MIND,"impressions; from the simplest of those combinations, to that mass"
767,I--THE MIND,"of knowledge which, including our own nature, constitutes what we"
768,I--THE MIND,call the universe.
769,I--THE MIND,
770,I--THE MIND,"We are intuitively conscious of our own existence, and of that"
771,I--THE MIND,"connexion in the train of our successive ideas, which we term our"
772,I--THE MIND,identity. We are conscious also of the existence of other minds;
773,I--THE MIND,"but not intuitively. Our evidence, with respect to the existence of"
774,I--THE MIND,"other minds, is founded upon a very complicated relation of ideas,"
775,I--THE MIND,which it is foreign to the purpose of this treatise to anatomize.
776,I--THE MIND,"The basis of this relation is, undoubtedly, a periodical recurrence"
777,I--THE MIND,"of masses of ideas, which our voluntary determinations have, in"
778,I--THE MIND,"one peculiar direction, no power to circumscribe or to arrest, and"
779,I--THE MIND,against the recurrence of which they can only imperfectly provide.
780,I--THE MIND,The irresistible laws of thought constrain us to believe that the
781,I--THE MIND,precise limits of our actual ideas are not the actual limits of
782,I--THE MIND,"possible ideas; the law, according to which these deductions are"
783,I--THE MIND,"drawn, is called analogy; and this is the foundation of all our"
784,I--THE MIND,"inferences, from one idea to another, inasmuch as they resemble"
785,I--THE MIND,each other.
786,I--THE MIND,
787,I--THE MIND,"We see trees, houses, fields, living beings in our own shape, and"
788,I--THE MIND,in shapes more or less analogous to our own. These are perpetually
789,I--THE MIND,changing the mode of their existence relatively to us. To express
790,I--THE MIND,"the varieties of these modes, we say, WE MOVE, THEY MOVE; and as this"
791,I--THE MIND,"motion is continual, though not uniform, we express our conception"
792,I--THE MIND,"of the diversities of its course by--IT HAS BEEN, IT IS, IT SHALL"
793,I--THE MIND,"BE. These diversities are events or objects, and are essential,"
794,I--THE MIND,"considered relatively to human identity, for the existence of the"
795,I--THE MIND,"human mind. For if the inequalities, produced by what has been"
796,I--THE MIND,"termed the operations of the external universe, were levelled by the"
797,I--THE MIND,"perception of our being, uniting and filling up their interstices,"
798,I--THE MIND,"motion and mensuration, and time, and space; the elements of the"
799,I--THE MIND,"human mind being thus abstracted, sensation and imagination cease."

855,IV--HOW THE ANALYSIS SHOULD BE CARRIED ON,"He is not a moral, and an intellectual,--but also, and pre-eminently,"

874,AND WAKING,
875,AND WAKING,"1. Let us reflect on our infancy, and give as faithfully as possible"
876,AND WAKING,a relation of the events of sleep.
877,AND WAKING,
878,AND WAKING,And first I am bound to present a faithful picture of my own peculiar
879,AND WAKING,nature relatively to sleep. I do not doubt that were every individual
880,AND WAKING,"to imitate me, it would be found that among many circumstances"
881,AND WAKING,"peculiar to their individual nature, a sufficiently general"
882,AND WAKING,resemblance would be found to prove the connexion existing between
883,AND WAKING,those peculiarities and the most universal phenomena. I shall employ
884,AND WAKING,"caution, indeed, as to the facts which I state, that they contain"
885,AND WAKING,nothing false or exaggerated. But they contain no more than certain
886,AND WAKING,elucidations of my own nature; concerning the degree in which
887,AND WAKING,"it resembles, or differs from, that of others, I am by no means"
888,AND WAKING,"accurately aware. It is sufficient, however, to caution the reader"
889,AND WAKING,against drawing general inferences from particular instances.
890,AND WAKING,
891,AND WAKING,"I omit the general instances of delusion in fever or delirium, as"
892,AND WAKING,well as mere dreams considered in themselves. A delineation of this
893,AND WAKING,"subject, however inexhaustible and interesting, is to be passed"
894,AND WAKING,over. What is the connexion of sleeping and of waking?
895,AND WAKING,
896,AND WAKING,"2. I distinctly remember dreaming three several times, between"
897,AND WAKING,"intervals of two or more years, the same precise dream.  It was"
898,AND WAKING,"not so much what is ordinarily called a dream; the single image,"
899,AND WAKING,"unconnected with all other images, of a youth who was educated at"
900,AND WAKING,"the same school with myself, presented itself in sleep. Even now,"
901,AND WAKING,"after the lapse of many years, I can never hear the name of this"
902,AND WAKING,"youth, without the three places where I dreamed of him presenting"
903,AND WAKING,themselves distinctly to my mind.
904,AND WAKING,
905,AND WAKING,"3. In dreams, images acquire associations peculiar to dreaming; so"
906,AND WAKING,"that the idea of a particular house, when it recurs a second time"
907,AND WAKING,"in dreams, will have relation with the idea of the same house, in"
908,AND WAKING,"the first time, of a nature entirely different from that which the"
909,AND WAKING,"house excites, when seen or thought of in relation to waking ideas."
910,AND WAKING,
911,AND WAKING,"4. I have beheld scenes, with the intimate and unaccountable"
912,AND WAKING,"connexion of which with the obscure parts of my own nature, I"
913,AND WAKING,have been irresistibly impressed. I have beheld a scene which has
914,AND WAKING,produced no unusual effect on my thoughts. After the lapse of many
915,AND WAKING,"years I have dreamed of this scene. It has hung on my memory, it"
916,AND WAKING,"has haunted my thoughts, at intervals, with the pertinacity of an"
917,AND WAKING,object connected with human affections. I have visited this scene
918,AND WAKING,"again. Neither the dream could be dissociated from the landscape,"
919,AND WAKING,"nor the landscape from the dream, nor feelings, such as neither"
920,AND WAKING,"singly could have awakened, from both."
921,AND WAKING,
922,AND WAKING,"But the most remarkable event of this nature, which ever occurred"
923,AND WAKING,"to me, happened five years ago at Oxford. I was walking with"
924,AND WAKING,"a friend, in the neighbourhood of that city, engaged in earnest"
925,AND WAKING,and interesting conversation. We suddenly turned the corner of a
926,AND WAKING,"lane, and the view, which its high banks and hedges had concealed,"
927,AND WAKING,"presented itself. The view consisted of a wind-mill, standing"
928,AND WAKING,"in one among many plashy meadows, inclosed with stone walls; the"
929,AND WAKING,"irregular and broken ground, between the wall and the road on which"
930,AND WAKING,"we stood; a long low hill behind the windmill, and a grey covering"
931,AND WAKING,of uniform cloud spread over the evening sky. It was that season
932,AND WAKING,when the last leaf had just fallen from the scant and stunted ash.
933,AND WAKING,The scene surely was a common scene; the season and the hour little
934,AND WAKING,calculated to kindle lawless thought; it was a tame uninteresting
935,AND WAKING,"assemblage of objects, such as would drive the imagination for"
936,AND WAKING,"refuge in serious and sober talk, to the evening fireside, and the"
937,AND WAKING,dessert of winter fruits and wine. The effect which it produced on
938,AND WAKING,me was not such as could have been expected. I suddenly remembered
939,AND WAKING,to have seen that exact scene in some dream of long--. [Footnote:

986,I--PLAN OF A TREATISE ON MORALS,to the degree in which they promote this end.
987,I--PLAN OF A TREATISE ON MORALS,
988,I--PLAN OF A TREATISE ON MORALS,This object is not merely the quantity of happiness enjoyed by
989,I--PLAN OF A TREATISE ON MORALS,"individuals as sensitive beings, but the mode in which it should"

1042,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"prompt him to inflict pain, and to arrogate dominion. He desires"
1043,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"to heap superfluities to his own store, although others perish with"
1044,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,famine. He is propelled to guard against the smallest invasion of
1045,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"his own liberty, though he reduces others to a condition of the most"
1046,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"pitiless servitude. He is revengeful, proud and selfish. Wherefore"
1047,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,should he curb these propensities?
1048,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,
1049,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"It is inquired, for what reason a human being should engage"
1050,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"in procuring the happiness, or refrain from producing the pain of"
1051,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,another? When a reason is required to prove the necessity of adopting
1052,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"any system of conduct, what is it that the objector demands? He"
1053,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,requires proof of that system of conduct being such as will most
1054,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"effectually promote the happiness of mankind.  To demonstrate this,"
1055,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,is to render a moral reason. Such is the object of virtue.
1056,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,
1057,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"A common sophism, which, like many others, depends on the abuse of"
1058,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"a metaphorical expression to a literal purpose, has produced much"
1059,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,of the confusion which has involved the theory of morals. It is said
1060,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"that no person is bound to be just or kind, if, on his neglect, he"
1061,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,should fail to incur some penalty. Duty is obligation. There can
1062,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"be no obligation without an obliger. Virtue is a law, to which it"
1063,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,is the will of the lawgiver that we should conform; which will we
1064,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"should in no manner be bound to obey, unless some dreadful punishment"
1065,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,were attached to disobedience. This is the philosophy of slavery
1066,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,and superstition.
1067,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,
1068,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"In fact, no person can be BOUND or OBLIGED, without some power"
1069,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,preceding to bind and oblige. If I observe a man bound hand and
1070,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"foot, I know that some one bound him. But if I observe him returning"
1071,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"self-satisfied from the performance of some action, by which he has"
1072,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"been the willing author of extensive benefit, I do not infer that"
1073,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"the anticipation of hellish agonies, or the hope of heavenly reward,"
1074,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,has constrained him to such an act.

1078,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,It remains to be stated in what manner the sensations which
1079,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,constitute the basis of virtue originate in the human mind; what
1080,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,are the laws which it receives there; how far the principles of
1081,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,"mind allow it to be an attribute of a human being; and, lastly,"
1082,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,what is the probability of persuading mankind to adopt it as a
1083,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,universal and systematic motive of conduct.
1084,CHAPTER I ON THE NATURE OF VIRTUE,
1085,BENEVOLENCE,BENEVOLENCE
1086,BENEVOLENCE,
1087,BENEVOLENCE,There is a class of emotions which we instinctively avoid. A human
1088,BENEVOLENCE,"being, such as is man considered in his origin, a child a month"
1089,BENEVOLENCE,"old, has a very imperfect consciousness of the existence of other"
1090,BENEVOLENCE,natures resembling itself. All the energies of its being are
1091,BENEVOLENCE,directed to the extinction of the pains with which it is perpetually
1092,BENEVOLENCE,assailed. At length it discovers that it is surrounded by natures
1093,BENEVOLENCE,susceptible of sensations similar to its own. It is very late before
1094,BENEVOLENCE,"children attain to this knowledge. If a child observes, without"
1095,BENEVOLENCE,"emotion, its nurse or its mother suffering acute pain, it is"
1096,BENEVOLENCE,attributable rather to ignorance than insensibility. So soon as
1097,BENEVOLENCE,"the accents and gestures, significant of pain, are referred to the"
1098,BENEVOLENCE,"feelings which they express, they awaken in the mind of the beholder"
1099,BENEVOLENCE,a desire that they should cease. Pain is thus apprehended to be evil
1100,BENEVOLENCE,"for its own sake, without any other necessary reference to the mind"
1101,BENEVOLENCE,"by which its existence is perceived, than such as is indispensable"
1102,BENEVOLENCE,"to its perception. The tendencies of our original sensations, indeed,"
1103,BENEVOLENCE,all have for their object the preservation of our individual being.
1104,BENEVOLENCE,But these are passive and unconscious. In proportion as the mind
1105,BENEVOLENCE,"acquires an active power, the empire of these tendencies becomes"
1106,BENEVOLENCE,"limited. Thus an infant, a savage, and a solitary beast, is selfish,"
1107,BENEVOLENCE,because its mind is incapable of receiving an accurate intimation
1108,BENEVOLENCE,of the nature of pain as existing in beings resembling itself.
1109,BENEVOLENCE,The inhabitant of a highly civilized community will more acutely
1110,BENEVOLENCE,"sympathize with the sufferings and enjoyments of others, than"
1111,BENEVOLENCE,the inhabitant of a society of a less degree of civilization. He
1112,BENEVOLENCE,who shall have cultivated his intellectual powers by familiarity
1113,BENEVOLENCE,"with the highest specimens of poetry and philosophy, will usually"
1114,BENEVOLENCE,sympathize more than one engaged in the less refined functions
1115,BENEVOLENCE,"of manual labour. Every one has experience of the fact, that to"
1116,BENEVOLENCE,"sympathize with the sufferings of another, is to enjoy a transitory"
1117,BENEVOLENCE,oblivion of his own.
1118,BENEVOLENCE,
1119,BENEVOLENCE,"The mind thus acquires, by exercise, a habit, as it were, of"
1120,BENEVOLENCE,"perceiving and abhorring evil, however remote from the immediate"
1121,BENEVOLENCE,sphere of sensations with which that individual mind is conversant.
1122,BENEVOLENCE,Imagination or mind employed in prophetically imaging forth its
1123,BENEVOLENCE,"objects, is that faculty of human nature on which every gradation"
1124,BENEVOLENCE,"of its progress, nay, every, the minutest, change, depends. Pain"
1125,BENEVOLENCE,"or pleasure, if subtly analysed, will be found to consist entirely"
1126,BENEVOLENCE,in prospect. The only distinction between the selfish man and the
1127,BENEVOLENCE,"virtuous man is, that the imagination of the former is confined within"
1128,BENEVOLENCE,"a narrow limit, whilst that of the latter embraces a comprehensive"
1129,BENEVOLENCE,"circumference. In this sense, wisdom and virtue may be said to be"
1130,BENEVOLENCE,"inseparable, and criteria of each other. Selfishness is the offspring"
1131,BENEVOLENCE,"of ignorance and mistake; it is the portion of unreflecting infancy,"
1132,BENEVOLENCE,"and savage solitude, or of those whom toil or evil occupations"
1133,BENEVOLENCE,have blunted or rendered torpid; disinterested benevolence is the
1134,BENEVOLENCE,"product of a cultivated imagination, and has an intimate connexion"
1135,BENEVOLENCE,"with all the arts which add ornament, or dignity, or power,"
1136,BENEVOLENCE,or stability to the social state of man. Virtue is thus entirely
1137,BENEVOLENCE,"a refinement of civilized life; a creation of the human mind; or,"
1138,BENEVOLENCE,"rather, a combination which it has made, according to elementary"
1139,BENEVOLENCE,"rules contained within itself, of the feelings suggested by the"
1140,BENEVOLENCE,relations established between man and man.
1141,BENEVOLENCE,
1142,BENEVOLENCE,"All the theories which have refined and exalted humanity, or those"
1143,BENEVOLENCE,"which have been devised as alleviations of its mistakes and evils,"
1144,BENEVOLENCE,"have been based upon the elementary emotions of disinterestedness,"
1145,BENEVOLENCE,"which we feel to constitute the majesty of our nature. Patriotism,"
1146,BENEVOLENCE,"as it existed in the ancient republics, was never, as has been"
1147,BENEVOLENCE,"supposed, a calculation of personal advantages. When Mutius Scaevola"
1148,BENEVOLENCE,"thrust his hand into the burning coals, and Regulus returned"
1149,BENEVOLENCE,"to Carthage, and Epicharis sustained the rack silently, in the"
1150,BENEVOLENCE,"torments of which she knew that she would speedily perish, rather"
1151,BENEVOLENCE,than betray the conspirators to the tyrant [Footnote: Tacitus.];
1152,BENEVOLENCE,these illustrious persons certainly made a small estimate of their
1153,BENEVOLENCE,private interest. If it be said that they sought posthumous fame;
1154,BENEVOLENCE,instances are not wanting in history which prove that men have even
1155,BENEVOLENCE,defied infamy for the sake of good. But there is a great error in
1156,BENEVOLENCE,the world with respect to the selfishness of fame. It is certainly
1157,BENEVOLENCE,possible that a person should seek distinction as a medium of
1158,BENEVOLENCE,personal gratification. But the love of fame is frequently no more
1159,BENEVOLENCE,"than a desire that the feelings of others should confirm, illustrate,"
1160,BENEVOLENCE,"and sympathize with, our own. In this respect it is allied with all"
1161,BENEVOLENCE,that draws us out of ourselves. It is the 'last infirmity of noble
1162,BENEVOLENCE,minds'. Chivalry was likewise founded on the theory of self-sacrifice.
1163,BENEVOLENCE,"Love possesses so extraordinary a power over the human heart, only"
1164,BENEVOLENCE,because disinterestedness is united with the natural propensities.
1165,BENEVOLENCE,These propensities themselves are comparatively impotent in cases
1166,BENEVOLENCE,"where the imagination of pleasure to be given, as well as to be"
1167,BENEVOLENCE,"received, does not enter into the account. Let it not be objected"
1168,BENEVOLENCE,"that patriotism, and chivalry, and sentimental love, have been the"
1169,BENEVOLENCE,fountains of enormous mischief. They are cited only to establish the
1170,BENEVOLENCE,"proposition that, according to the elementary principles of mind,"
1171,BENEVOLENCE,man is capable of desiring and pursuing good for its own sake.

1175,JUSTICE,
1176,JUSTICE,The benevolent propensities are thus inherent in the human mind.
1177,JUSTICE,We are impelled to seek the happiness of others. We experience
1178,JUSTICE,a satisfaction in being the authors of that happiness. Everything
1179,JUSTICE,that lives is open to impressions or pleasure and pain. We are
1180,JUSTICE,led by our benevolent propensities to regard every human being
1181,JUSTICE,indifferently with whom we come in contact. They have preference
1182,JUSTICE,only with respect to those who offer themselves most obviously
1183,JUSTICE,to our notice. Human beings are indiscriminating and blind; they
1184,JUSTICE,"will avoid inflicting pain, though that pain should be attended"
1185,JUSTICE,with eventual benefit; they will seek to confer pleasure without
1186,JUSTICE,calculating the mischief that may result. They benefit one at the
1187,JUSTICE,expense of many.
1188,JUSTICE,
1189,JUSTICE,There is a sentiment in the human mind that regulates benevolence
1190,JUSTICE,in its application as a principle of action. This is the sense of
1191,JUSTICE,"justice. Justice, as well as benevolence, is an elementary law of"
1192,JUSTICE,human nature. It is through this principle that men are impelled
1193,JUSTICE,to distribute any means of pleasure which benevolence may suggest
1194,JUSTICE,"the communication of to others, in equal portions among an equal"
1195,JUSTICE,"number of applicants. If ten men are shipwrecked on a desert island,"
1196,JUSTICE,"they distribute whatever subsistence may remain to them, into equal"
1197,JUSTICE,portions among themselves. If six of them conspire to deprive the
1198,JUSTICE,"remaining four of their share, their conduct is termed unjust."
1199,JUSTICE,
1200,JUSTICE,The existence of pain has been shown to be a circumstance which the
1201,JUSTICE,"human mind regards with dissatisfaction, and of which it desires"
1202,JUSTICE,the cessation. It is equally according to its nature to desire that
1203,JUSTICE,the advantages to be enjoyed by a limited number of persons should
1204,JUSTICE,be enjoyed equally by all. This proposition is supported by the
1205,JUSTICE,evidence of indisputable facts. Tell some ungarbled tale of a number
1206,JUSTICE,"of persons being made the victims of the enjoyments of one, and he"
1207,JUSTICE,who would appeal in favour of any system which might produce such
1208,JUSTICE,"an evil to the primary emotions of our nature, would have nothing"
1209,JUSTICE,"to reply. Let two persons, equally strangers, make application for"
1210,JUSTICE,"some benefit in the possession of a third to bestow, and to which"
1211,JUSTICE,he feels that they have an equal claim. They are both sensitive
1212,JUSTICE,beings; pleasure and pain affect them alike.

1217,CHAPTER II,
1218,CHAPTER II,It is foreign to the general scope of this little treatise to encumber
1219,CHAPTER II,a simple argument by controverting any of the trite objections of
1220,CHAPTER II,"habit or fanaticism. But there are two; the first, the basis of all"
1221,CHAPTER II,"political mistake, and the second, the prolific cause and effect"
1222,CHAPTER II,"of religious error, which it seems useful to refute."
1223,CHAPTER II,
1224,CHAPTER II,"First, it is inquired, 'Wherefore should a man be benevolent and"
1225,CHAPTER II,just?' The answer has been given in the preceding chapter.
1226,CHAPTER II,
1227,CHAPTER II,If a man persists to inquire why he ought to promote the happiness
1228,CHAPTER II,"of mankind, he demands a mathematical or metaphysical reason for"
1229,CHAPTER II,"a moral action. The absurdity of this scepticism is more apparent,"
1230,CHAPTER II,but not less real than the exacting a moral reason for a mathematical
1231,CHAPTER II,or metaphysical fact. If any person should refuse to admit that all
1232,CHAPTER II,"the radii of a circle are of equal length, or that human actions"
1233,CHAPTER II,"are necessarily determined by motives, until it could be proved that"
1234,CHAPTER II,these radii and these actions uniformly tended to the production of
1235,CHAPTER II,"the greatest general good, who would not wonder at the unreasonable"
1236,CHAPTER II,and capricious association of his ideas?
1237,CHAPTER II,
1238,CHAPTER II,"The writer of a philosophical treatise may, I imagine, at this"
1239,CHAPTER II,"advanced era of human intellect, be held excused from entering into"
1240,CHAPTER II,"a controversy with those reasoners, if such there are, who would"
1241,CHAPTER II,claim an exemption from its decrees in favour of any one among those
1242,CHAPTER II,"diversified systems of obscure opinion respecting morals, which,"
1243,CHAPTER II,"under the name of religions, have in various ages and countries"
1244,CHAPTER II,"prevailed among mankind. Besides that if, as these reasoners have"
1245,CHAPTER II,"pretended, eternal torture or happiness will ensue as the consequence"
1246,CHAPTER II,"of certain actions, we should be no nearer the possession of a"
1247,CHAPTER II,"standard to determine what actions were right and wrong, even if this"
1248,CHAPTER II,"pretended revelation, which is by no means the case, had furnished"
1249,CHAPTER II,us with a complete catalogue of them. The character of actions as
1250,CHAPTER II,virtuous or vicious would by no means be determined alone by the
1251,CHAPTER II,personal advantage or disadvantage of each moral agent individually
1252,CHAPTER II,"considered. Indeed, an action is often virtuous in proportion to"
1253,CHAPTER II,the greatness of the personal calamity which the author willingly
1254,CHAPTER II,draws upon himself by daring to perform it. It is because an
1255,CHAPTER II,action produces an overbalance of pleasure or pain to the greatest
1256,CHAPTER II,"number of sentient beings, and not merely because its consequences"
1257,CHAPTER II,"are beneficial or injurious to the author of that action, that it"
1258,CHAPTER II,"is good or evil. Nay, this latter consideration has a tendency to"
1259,CHAPTER II,"pollute the purity of virtue, inasmuch as it consists in the motive"
1260,CHAPTER II,rather than in the consequences of an action. A person who should
1261,CHAPTER II,labour for the happiness of mankind lest he should be tormented
1262,CHAPTER II,"eternally in Hell, would, with reference to that motive, possess as"
1263,CHAPTER II,"little claim to the epithet of virtuous, as he who should torture,"
1264,CHAPTER II,"imprison, and burn them alive, a more usual and natural consequence"
1265,CHAPTER II,"of such principles, for the sake of the enjoyments of Heaven."
1266,CHAPTER II,
1267,CHAPTER II,"My neighbour, presuming on his strength, may direct me to perform"
1268,CHAPTER II,or to refrain from a particular action; indicating a certain arbitrary
1269,CHAPTER II,penalty in the event of disobedience within power to inflict.
1270,CHAPTER II,"My action, if modified by his menaces, can no degree participate"
1271,CHAPTER II,in virtue. He has afforded me no criterion as to what is right or
1272,CHAPTER II,"wrong. A king, or an assembly of men, may publish a proclamation"
1273,CHAPTER II,"affixing any penalty to any particular action, but that is not"
1274,CHAPTER II,immoral because such penalty is affixed. Nothing is more evident
1275,CHAPTER II,than that the epithet of virtue is inapplicable to the refraining
1276,CHAPTER II,from that action on account of the evil arbitrarily attached to it.
1277,CHAPTER II,"If the action is in itself beneficial, virtue would rather consist"
1278,CHAPTER II,"in not refraining from it, but in firmly defying the personal"
1279,CHAPTER II,consequences attached to its performance.
1280,CHAPTER II,
1281,CHAPTER II,Some usurper of supernatural energy might subdue the whole globe
1282,CHAPTER II,to his power; he might possess new and unheard-of resources for
1283,CHAPTER II,enduing his punishments with the most terrible attributes or pain.
1284,CHAPTER II,"The torments of his victims might be intense in their degree,"
1285,CHAPTER II,and protracted to an infinite duration. Still the 'will of the
1286,CHAPTER II,lawgiver' would afford no surer criterion as to what actions were
1287,CHAPTER II,right or wrong. It would only increase the possible virtue of those
1288,CHAPTER II,who refuse to become the instruments of his tyranny.

1302,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS",divided. Their obvious actions are apparently uniform: the stability
1303,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS",of human society seems to be maintained sufficiently by the uniformity
1304,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","of the conduct of its members, both with regard to themselves,"
1305,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","and with regard to others.  The labourer arises at a certain hour,"
1306,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS",and applies himself to the task enjoined him. The functionaries
1307,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS",of government and law are regularly employed in their offices and
1308,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS",courts. The trader holds a train of conduct from which he never
1309,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","deviates. The ministers of religion employ an accustomed language,"
1310,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","and maintain a decent and equable regard. The army is drawn forth,"
1311,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS",the motions of every soldier are such as they were expected to be;
1312,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","the general commands, and his words are echoed from troop to troop."
1313,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","The domestic actions of men are, for the most part, undistinguishable"
1314,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","one from the other, at a superficial glance. The actions which"
1315,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","are classed under the general appellation of marriage, education,"
1316,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","friendship, &c., are perpetually going on, and to a superficial"
1317,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","glance, are similar one to the other."
1318,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS",
1319,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","But, if we would see the truth of things, they must be stripped of"
1320,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","this fallacious appearance of uniformity. In truth, no one action"
1321,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","has, when considered in its whole extent, any essential resemblance"
1322,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","with any other. Each individual, who composes the vast multitude"

1324,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","which, whilst the features of the great mass of his actions remain"
1325,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","uniform, impresses the minuter lineaments with its peculiar hues."
1326,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","Thus, whilst his life, as a whole, is like the lives of other men,"
1327,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","in detail, it is most unlike; and the more subdivided the actions"

1337,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS",evanescent expression of countenance; these flow from a profounder
1338,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","source than the series of our habitual conduct, which, it has"
1339,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","been already said, derives its origin from without. These are the"
1340,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","actions, and such as these, which make human life what it is, and"
1341,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS",are the fountains of all the good and evil with which its entire
1342,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS",surface is so widely and impartially overspread; and though they are
1343,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","called minute, they are called so in compliance with the blindness"
1344,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS",of those who cannot estimate their importance. It is in the due
1345,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","appreciating the general effects of their peculiarities, and in"
1346,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS",cultivating the habit of acquiring decisive knowledge respecting
1347,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","the tendencies arising out of them in particular cases, that the"

1351,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS",
1352,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS",This is the difference between social and individual man. Not that
1353,"RESEMBLANCE, OF PERSONS","this distinction is to be considered definite, or characteristic"

1392,A FRAGMENT,The period which intervened between the birth of Pericles and the
1393,A FRAGMENT,"death of Aristotle, is undoubtedly, whether considered in itself,"
1394,A FRAGMENT,or with reference to the effects which it has produced upon
1395,A FRAGMENT,"the subsequent destinies of civilized man, the most memorable in"
1396,A FRAGMENT,the history of the world. What was the combination of moral and
1397,A FRAGMENT,political circumstances which produced so unparalleled a progress
1398,A FRAGMENT,"during that period in literature and the arts;--why that progress,"
1399,A FRAGMENT,"so rapid and so sustained, so soon received a check, and became"
1400,A FRAGMENT,"retrograde,--are problems left to the wonder and conjecture of"
1401,A FRAGMENT,posterity. The wrecks and fragments of those subtle and profound
1402,A FRAGMENT,"minds, like the ruins of a fine statue, obscurely suggest to us the"
1403,A FRAGMENT,grandeur and perfection of the whole. Their very language--a type
1404,A FRAGMENT,of the understandings of which it was the creation and the image--in
1405,A FRAGMENT,"variety, in simplicity, in flexibility, and in copiousness, excels"
1406,A FRAGMENT,every other language of the western world. Their sculptures are
1407,A FRAGMENT,"such as we, in our presumption, assume to be the models of ideal"
1408,A FRAGMENT,"truth and beauty, and to which no artist of modern times can"
1409,A FRAGMENT,"produce forms in any degree comparable. Their paintings, according"
1410,A FRAGMENT,"to Pliny and Pausanias, were full of delicacy and harmony; and some"
1411,A FRAGMENT,"even were powerfully pathetic, so as to awaken, like tender music"
1412,A FRAGMENT,"or tragic poetry, the most overwhelming emotions. We are accustomed"
1413,A FRAGMENT,"to conceive the painters of the sixteenth century, as those who"
1414,A FRAGMENT,"have brought their art to the highest perfection, probably because"
1415,A FRAGMENT,none of the ancient paintings have been preserved. For all the
1416,A FRAGMENT,"inventive arts maintain, as it were, a sympathetic connexion between"
1417,A FRAGMENT,"each other, being no more than various expressions of one internal"
1418,A FRAGMENT,"power, modified by different circumstances, either of an individual,"
1419,A FRAGMENT,or of society; and the paintings of that period would probably bear
1420,A FRAGMENT,the same relation as is confessedly borne by the sculptures to all
1421,A FRAGMENT,succeeding ones. Of their music we know little; but the effects
1422,A FRAGMENT,"which it is said to have produced, whether they be attributed to"
1423,A FRAGMENT,"the skill of the composer, or the sensibility of his audience, are"
1424,A FRAGMENT,far more powerful than any which we experience from the music of
1425,A FRAGMENT,"our own times; and if, indeed, the melody of their compositions"
1426,A FRAGMENT,"were more tender and delicate, and inspiring, than the melodies of"
1427,A FRAGMENT,"some modern European nations, their superiority in this art must"
1428,A FRAGMENT,"have been something wonderful, and wholly beyond conception."
1429,A FRAGMENT,
1430,A FRAGMENT,"Their poetry seems to maintain a very high, though not so"
1431,A FRAGMENT,"disproportionate a rank, in the comparison. Perhaps Shakespeare, from"
1432,A FRAGMENT,"the variety and comprehension of his genius, is to be considered,"
1433,A FRAGMENT,"on the whole, as the greatest individual mind, of which we have"
1434,A FRAGMENT,specimens remaining. Perhaps Dante created imaginations of greater
1435,A FRAGMENT,loveliness and energy than any that are to be found in the ancient
1436,A FRAGMENT,literature of Greece. Perhaps nothing has been discovered in the
1437,A FRAGMENT,fragments of the Greek lyric poets equivalent to the sublime and
1438,A FRAGMENT,"chivalric sensibility of Petrarch.--But, as a poet. Homer must be"
1439,A FRAGMENT,"acknowledged to excel Shakespeare in the truth, the harmony, the"
1440,A FRAGMENT,"sustained grandeur, the satisfying completeness of his images, their"
1441,A FRAGMENT,"exact fitness to the illustration, and to that to which they belong."
1442,A FRAGMENT,"Nor could Dante, deficient in conduct, plan, nature, variety, and"
1443,A FRAGMENT,"temperance, have been brought into comparison with these men, but"
1444,A FRAGMENT,"for those fortunate isles laden with golden fruit, which alone"
1445,A FRAGMENT,could tempt any one to embark in the misty ocean of his dark and
1446,A FRAGMENT,extravagant fiction.
1447,A FRAGMENT,
1448,A FRAGMENT,"But, omitting the comparison of individual minds, which can afford"
1449,A FRAGMENT,"no general inference, how superior was the spirit and system of"
1450,A FRAGMENT,their poetry to that of any other period! So that had any other
1451,A FRAGMENT,genius equal in other respects to the greatest that ever enlightened
1452,A FRAGMENT,"the world, arisen in that age, he would have been superior to all,"
1453,A FRAGMENT,from this circumstance alone--that had conceptions would have assumed
1454,A FRAGMENT,"a more harmonious and perfect form. For it is worthy of observation,"
1455,A FRAGMENT,that whatever the poet of that age produced is as harmonious and
1456,A FRAGMENT,"perfect as possible. In a drama, for instance, were the composition"
1457,A FRAGMENT,"of a person of inferior talent, it was still homogeneous and free"
1458,A FRAGMENT,"from inequalities it was a whole, consistent with itself. The"
1459,A FRAGMENT,compositions of great minds bore throughout the sustained stamp of
1460,A FRAGMENT,their greatness. In the poetry of succeeding ages the expectations
1461,A FRAGMENT,"are often exalted on Icarian wings, and fall, too much disappointed"
1462,A FRAGMENT,to give a memory and a name to the oblivious pool in which they
1463,A FRAGMENT,fell.

1465,A FRAGMENT,In physical knowledge Aristotle and Theophrastus had already--no
1466,A FRAGMENT,doubt assisted by the labours of those of their predecessor whom

1471,A FRAGMENT,"opened as it were the doors of the mysteries of nature, had already"
1472,A FRAGMENT,"been brought to great perfection. Metaphysics, the science of man's"
1473,A FRAGMENT,"intimate nature, and logic, or the grammar and elementary principles"
1474,A FRAGMENT,of that science received from the latter philosophers of the Periclean
1475,A FRAGMENT,age a firm basis. All our more exact philosophy is built upon the
1476,A FRAGMENT,"labours of these great men, and many of the words which we employ"
1477,A FRAGMENT,in metaphysical distinctions were invented by them to give accuracy
1478,A FRAGMENT,"and system to their reasonings. The science of morals, or the"
1479,A FRAGMENT,"voluntary conduct of men in relation to themselves or others, dates"
1480,A FRAGMENT,from this epoch. How inexpressibly bolder and more pure were the
1481,A FRAGMENT,"doctrines of those great men, in comparison with the timid maxims"
1482,A FRAGMENT,which prevail in the writings of the most esteemed modern moralists!
1483,A FRAGMENT,"They were such as Phocion, and Epaminondas, and Timoleon, who formed"
1484,A FRAGMENT,"themselves on their influence, were to the wretched heroes of our"
1485,A FRAGMENT,own age.

1487,A FRAGMENT,Their political and religious institutions are more difficult to
1488,A FRAGMENT,bring into comparison with those of other times. A summary idea
1489,A FRAGMENT,"may be formed of the worth of any political and religious system,"
1490,A FRAGMENT,by observing the comparative degree of happiness and of intellect
1491,A FRAGMENT,produced under its influence. And whilst many institution and
1492,A FRAGMENT,"opinions, which in ancient Greece were obstacles to the improvement"
1493,A FRAGMENT,"of the human race, have been abolished among modern nations, how"
1494,A FRAGMENT,"many pernicious superstitions and new contrivances of misrule, and"
1495,A FRAGMENT,"unheard-of complications of public mischief, have not been invented"
1496,A FRAGMENT,among them by the ever-watchful spirit of avarice and tyranny!
1497,A FRAGMENT,
1498,A FRAGMENT,The modern nations of the civilized world owe the progress which
1499,A FRAGMENT,they have made--as well in those physical sciences in which they
1500,A FRAGMENT,"have already excelled their masters, as in the moral and intellectual"
1501,A FRAGMENT,"inquiries, in which, with all the advantage of the experience of"
1502,A FRAGMENT,"the latter, it can scarcely be said that they have yet equalled"
1503,A FRAGMENT,"them,--to what is called the revival of learning; that is, the study"
1504,A FRAGMENT,of the writers of the age which preceded and immediately followed
1505,A FRAGMENT,"the government of Pericles, or of subsequent writers, who were,"
1506,A FRAGMENT,"so to speak, the rivers flowing from those immortal fountains."
1507,A FRAGMENT,"And though there seems to be a principle in the modern world,"
1508,A FRAGMENT,"which, should circumstances analogous to those which modelled"
1509,A FRAGMENT,"the intellectual resources of the age to which we refer, into so"
1510,A FRAGMENT,"harmonious a proportion, again arise, would arrest and perpetuate"
1511,A FRAGMENT,"them, and consign their results to a more equal, extensive, and"
1512,A FRAGMENT,lasting improvement of the condition of man--though justice and
1513,A FRAGMENT,"the true meaning of human society are, if not more accurately, more"
1514,A FRAGMENT,"generally understood; though perhaps men know more, and therefore"
1515,A FRAGMENT,"are more, as a mass, yet this principle has never been called into"
1516,A FRAGMENT,"action, and requires indeed a universal and an almost appalling change"
1517,A FRAGMENT,in the system of existing things. The study of modern history is
1518,A FRAGMENT,"the study of kings, financiers, statesmen, and priests. The history"
1519,A FRAGMENT,"of ancient Greece is the study of legislators, philosophers,"
1520,A FRAGMENT,"and poets; it is the history of men, compared with the history of"
1521,A FRAGMENT,"titles. What the Greeks were, was a reality, not a promise. And what"
1522,A FRAGMENT,"we are and hope to be, is derived, as it were, from the influence"
1523,A FRAGMENT,and inspiration of these glorious generations.
1524,A FRAGMENT,

1526,A FRAGMENT,"opinions of those to whom we owe so much, and who were perhaps, on"
1527,A FRAGMENT,"the whole, the most perfect specimens of humanity of whom we have"
1528,A FRAGMENT,"authentic record, were infinitely valuable. Let us see their errors,"
1529,A FRAGMENT,"their weaknesses, their daily actions, their familiar conversation,"
1530,A FRAGMENT,and catch the tone of their society. When we discover how far the
1531,A FRAGMENT,most admirable community ever framed was removed from that perfection
1532,A FRAGMENT,to which human society is impelled by some active power within each
1533,A FRAGMENT,"bosom to aspire, how great ought to be our hopes, how resolute our"
1534,A FRAGMENT,struggles! For the Greeks of the Periclean age were widely different
1535,A FRAGMENT,from us. It is to be lamented that no modern writer has hitherto
1536,A FRAGMENT,dared to show them precisely as they were. Barthelemi cannot
1537,A FRAGMENT,be denied the praise of industry and system; but he never forgets
1538,A FRAGMENT,"that he is a Christian and a Frenchman. Wieland, in his delightful"
1539,A FRAGMENT,"novels, makes indeed a very tolerable Pagan, but cherishes too many"
1540,A FRAGMENT,"political prejudices, and refrains from diminishing the interest of"
1541,A FRAGMENT,his romances by painting sentiments in which no European of modern
1542,A FRAGMENT,times can possibly sympathize. There is no book which shows the
1543,A FRAGMENT,Greeks precisely as they were; they seem all written for children
1544,A FRAGMENT,"with the caution that no practice or sentiment, highly inconsistent"
1545,A FRAGMENT,"with our present manners, should be mentioned, lest those manners"
1546,A FRAGMENT,should receive outrage and violation. But there are many to whom
1547,A FRAGMENT,"the Greek language is inaccessible, who ought not to be excluded by"
1548,A FRAGMENT,this prudery from possessing an exact and comprehensive conception
1549,A FRAGMENT,of the history of man; for there is no knowledge concerning what man
1550,A FRAGMENT,"has been and may be, from partaking of which a person can depart,"
1551,A FRAGMENT,"without becoming in some degree more philosophical, tolerant, and"
1552,A FRAGMENT,just.
1553,A FRAGMENT,
1554,A FRAGMENT,One of the chief distinctions between the manners of ancient Greece
1555,A FRAGMENT,"and modern Europe, consisted in the regulations and the sentiments"
1556,A FRAGMENT,respecting sexual intercourse. Whether this difference arises from
1557,A FRAGMENT,"some imperfect influence of the doctrines of Jesus, who alleges"
1558,A FRAGMENT,"the absolute and unconditional equality of all human beings, or"
1559,A FRAGMENT,"from the institutions of chivalry, or from a certain fundamental"
1560,A FRAGMENT,"difference of physical nature existing in the Celts, or from a"
1561,A FRAGMENT,"combination of all or any of these causes acting on each other, is"
1562,A FRAGMENT,"a question worthy of voluminous investigation. The fact is, that"
1563,A FRAGMENT,"the modern Europeans have in this circumstance, and in the abolition"
1564,A FRAGMENT,"of slavery, made an improvement the most decisive in the regulation"
1565,A FRAGMENT,of human society; and all the virtue and the wisdom of the Periclean
1566,A FRAGMENT,"age arose under other institutions, in spite of the diminution"
1567,A FRAGMENT,"which personal slavery and the inferiority of women, recognized by"
1568,A FRAGMENT,"law and opinion, must have produced in the delicacy, the strength,"
1569,A FRAGMENT,"the comprehensiveness, and the accuracy of their conceptions, in"
1570,A FRAGMENT,"moral, political, and metaphysical science, and perhaps in every"
1571,A FRAGMENT,other art and science.
1572,A FRAGMENT,
1573,A FRAGMENT,"The women, thus degraded, became such as it was expected they"
1574,A FRAGMENT,"would become. They possessed, except with extraordinary exceptions,"
1575,A FRAGMENT,the habits and the qualities of slaves. They were probably not
1576,A FRAGMENT,extremely beautiful; at least there was no such disproportion in
1577,A FRAGMENT,the attractions of the external form between the female and male
1578,A FRAGMENT,"sex among the Greeks, as exists among the modern Europeans. They"
1579,A FRAGMENT,were certainly devoid of that moral and intellectual loveliness
1580,A FRAGMENT,with which the acquisition of knowledge and the cultivation of
1581,A FRAGMENT,"sentiment animates, as with another life of overpowering grace,"
1582,A FRAGMENT,the lineaments and the gestures of every form which they inhabit.
1583,A FRAGMENT,Their eyes could not have been deep and intricate from the workings
1584,A FRAGMENT,"of the mind, and could have entangled no heart in soul-enwoven"
1585,A FRAGMENT,labyrinths.
1586,A FRAGMENT,
1587,A FRAGMENT,Let it not be imagined that because the Greeks were deprived of
1588,A FRAGMENT,"its legitimate object, they were incapable of sentimental love; and"
1589,A FRAGMENT,that this passion is the mere child of chivalry and the literature of
1590,A FRAGMENT,modern times. This object or its archetype for ever exists in the
1591,A FRAGMENT,"mind, which selects among those who resemble it that which most"
1592,A FRAGMENT,resembles it; and instinctively fills up the interstices of the
1593,A FRAGMENT,"imperfect image, in the same manner as the imagination moulds and"
1594,A FRAGMENT,"completes the shapes in clouds, or in the fire, into the resemblances"
1595,A FRAGMENT,"of whatever form, animal, building, &c., happens to be present to"
1596,A FRAGMENT,it. Man is in his wildest state a social being: a certain degree
1597,A FRAGMENT,of civilization and refinement ever produces the want of sympathies
1598,A FRAGMENT,still more intimate and complete; and the gratification of the
1599,A FRAGMENT,senses is no longer all that is sought in sexual connexion. It
1600,A FRAGMENT,soon becomes a very small part of that profound and complicated
1601,A FRAGMENT,"sentiment, which we call love, which is rather the universal thirst"
1602,A FRAGMENT,"for a communion not only of the senses, but of our whole nature,"
1603,A FRAGMENT,"intellectual, imaginative and sensitive, and which, when individualized,"
1604,A FRAGMENT,"becomes an imperious necessity, only to be satisfied by the complete"
1605,A FRAGMENT,"or partial, actual or supposed fulfilment of its claims. This want"
1606,A FRAGMENT,grows more powerful in proportion to the development which our
1607,A FRAGMENT,"nature receives from civilization, for man never ceases to be a"
1608,A FRAGMENT,"social being. The sexual impulse, which is only one, and often a"
1609,A FRAGMENT,"small part of those claims, serves, from its obvious and external"
1610,A FRAGMENT,"nature, as a kind of type or expression of the rest, a common basis,"
1611,A FRAGMENT,an acknowledged and visible link. Still it is a claim which even
1612,A FRAGMENT,derives a strength not its own from the accessory circumstances
1613,A FRAGMENT,"which surround it, and one which our nature thirsts to satisfy. To"
1614,A FRAGMENT,"estimate this, observe the degree of intensity and durability of"
1615,A FRAGMENT,the love of the male towards the female in animals and savages and
1616,A FRAGMENT,acknowledge all the duration and intensity observable in the love
1617,A FRAGMENT,of civilized beings beyond that of savages to be produced from
1618,A FRAGMENT,other causes. In the susceptibility of the external senses there
1619,A FRAGMENT,is probably no important difference.
1620,A FRAGMENT,
1621,A FRAGMENT,"Among the ancient Greeks the male sex, one half of the human race,"
1622,A FRAGMENT,"received the highest cultivation and refinement: whilst the other,"
1623,A FRAGMENT,"so far as intellect is concerned, were educated as slaves and were"
1624,A FRAGMENT,raised but few degrees in all that related to moral of intellectual
1625,A FRAGMENT,excellence above the condition of savages. The gradations in the
1626,A FRAGMENT,society of man present us with slow improvement in this respect.
1627,A FRAGMENT,"The Roman women held a higher consideration in society, and were"
1628,A FRAGMENT,esteemed almost as the equal partners with their husbands in the
1629,A FRAGMENT,regulation of domestic economy and the education of their children.
1630,A FRAGMENT,The practices and customs of modern Europe are essentially different
1631,A FRAGMENT,"from and incomparably less pernicious than either, however remote"

1662,A FRAGMENT,on which a long series and an incalculable variety of popular

1667,A FRAGMENT,"impressions, which hurry the persuasions onward, as in a breathless"

1669,A FRAGMENT,"a man. Lord Bacon is, perhaps, the only writer, who, in these"
1670,A FRAGMENT,"particulars, can be compared with him: his imitator, Cicero, sinks"
1671,A FRAGMENT,in the comparison into an ape mocking the gestures of a man.  His
1672,A FRAGMENT,"views into the nature of mind and existence are often obscure, only"
1673,A FRAGMENT,because they are profound; and though his theories respecting the
1674,A FRAGMENT,"government of the world, and the elementary laws of moral action,"
1675,A FRAGMENT,"are not always correct, yet there is scarcely any of his treatises"

1682,A FRAGMENT,
1683,A FRAGMENT,"The dialogue entitled the Banquet, is called [word in Greek], or"
1684,A FRAGMENT,"a Discussion upon Love, and is supposed to have taken place at the"
1685,A FRAGMENT,"house of Agathon, at one of a series of festivals given by that"
1686,A FRAGMENT,"poet, on the occasion of his gaining the prize of tragedy at the"
1687,A FRAGMENT,Dionysiaca. The account of the debate on this occasion is supposed
1688,A FRAGMENT,"to have been given by Apollodorus, a pupil of Socrates, many"
1689,A FRAGMENT,"years after it had taken place, to a companion who was curious to"
1690,A FRAGMENT,"hear it.  This Apollodorus appears, both from the style in which"
1691,A FRAGMENT,"he is represented in this piece, as well as from a passage in the"
1692,A FRAGMENT,"Phaedon, to have been a person of an impassioned and enthusiastic"
1693,A FRAGMENT,"disposition; to borrow an image from the Italian painters, he seems"
1694,A FRAGMENT,to have been the St. John of the Socratic group. The drama (for so
1695,A FRAGMENT,the lively distinction of character and the various and well-wrought

1710,I,
1711,I,According to one mode of regarding those two classes of mental
1712,I,"action, which are called reason and imagination, the former may be"
1713,I,considered as mind contemplating the relations borne by one thought
1714,I,"to another, however produced; and the latter, as mind acting upon"
1715,I,"those thoughts so as to colour them with its own light, and composing"
1716,I,"from them, as from elements, other thoughts, each containing within"
1717,I,itself the principle of its own integrity. The one is the [word
1718,I,"in Greek], or the principle of synthesis, and has for its objects"
1719,I,those forms which are common to universal nature and existence
1720,I,"itself; the other is the [word in Greek], or principle of analysis,"
1721,I,"and its action regards the relations of things, simply as relations;"
1722,I,"considering thoughts, not in their integral unity, but as the"
1723,I,algebraical representations which conduct to certain general results.
1724,I,Reason is the enumeration of quantities already known; imagination
1725,I,"is the perception of the value of those quantities, both separately"
1726,I,"and as a whole. Reason respects the differences, and imagination"
1727,I,the similitudes of things.  Reason is to the imagination as the
1728,I,"instrument to the agent, as the body to the spirit, as the shadow"
1729,I,to the substance.
1730,I,
1731,I,"Poetry, in a general sense, may be defined to be 'the expression"
1732,I,of the imagination': and poetry is connate with the origin of man.
1733,I,Man is an instrument over which a series of external and internal
1734,I,"impressions are driven, like the alternations of an ever-changing"
1735,I,"wind over an Aeolian lyre, which move it by their motion to"
1736,I,ever-changing melody. But there is a principle within the human
1737,I,"being, and perhaps within all sentient beings, which acts otherwise"
1738,I,"than in the lyre, and produces not melody alone, but harmony,"
1739,I,by an internal adjustment of the sounds or motions thus excited
1740,I,to the impressions which excite them. It is as if the lyre could
1741,I,"accommodate its chords to the motions of that which strikes them,"
1742,I,in a determined proportion of sound; even as the musician can
1743,I,accommodate his voice to the sound of the lyre. A child at play
1744,I,by itself will express its delight by its voice and motions; and
1745,I,every inflexion of tone and every gesture will bear exact relation
1746,I,to a corresponding antitype in the pleasurable impressions which
1747,I,awakened it; it will be the reflected image of that impression;
1748,I,"and as the lyre trembles and sounds after the wind has died away,"
1749,I,"so the child seeks, by prolonging in its voice and motions the"
1750,I,"duration of the effect, to prolong also a consciousness of the"
1751,I,"cause. In relation to the objects which delight a child, these"
1752,I,"expressions are, what poetry is to higher objects. The savage (for"
1753,I,the savage is to ages what the child is to years) expresses the
1754,I,emotions produced in him by surrounding objects in a similar manner;
1755,I,"and language and gesture, together with plastic or pictorial imitation,"
1756,I,"become the image of the combined effect of those objects, and of"
1757,I,"his apprehension of them. Man in society, with all his passions and"
1758,I,"his pleasures, next becomes the object of the passions and pleasures"
1759,I,of man; an additional class of emotions produces an augmented
1760,I,"treasure of expressions; and language, gesture, and the imitative"
1761,I,"arts, become at once the representation and the medium, the pencil"
1762,I,"and the picture, the chisel and the statue, the chord and the"
1763,I,"harmony. The social sympathies, or those laws from which, as from"
1764,I,"its elements, society results, begin to develop themselves from"
1765,I,the moment that two human beings coexist; the future is contained
1766,I,"within the present, as the plant within the seed; and equality,"
1767,I,"diversity, unity, contrast, mutual dependence, become the principles"
1768,I,alone capable of affording the motives according to which the
1769,I,"will of a social being is determined to action, inasmuch as he is"
1770,I,"social; and constitute pleasure in sensation, virtue in sentiment,"
1771,I,"beauty in art, truth in reasoning, and love in the intercourse of"
1772,I,"kind. Hence men, even in the infancy of society, observe a certain"
1773,I,"order in their words and actions, distinct from that of the objects"
1774,I,"and the impressions represented by them, all expression being"
1775,I,subject to the laws of that from which it proceeds. But let us
1776,I,dismiss those more general considerations which might involve an
1777,I,"inquiry into the principles of society itself, and restrict our"
1778,I,view to the manner in which the imagination is expressed upon its
1779,I,forms.
1780,I,
1781,I,"In the youth of the world, men dance and sing and imitate natural"
1782,I,"objects, observing in these actions, as in all others, a certain"
1783,I,"rhythm or order. And, although all men observe a similar, they"
1784,I,"observe not the same order, in the motions of the dance, in the"
1785,I,"melody of the song, in the combinations of language, in the series"
1786,I,of their imitations of natural objects. For there is a certain
1787,I,order or rhythm belonging to each of these classes of mimetic
1788,I,"representation, from which the hearer and the spectator receive"
1789,I,an intenser and purer pleasure than from any other: the sense
1790,I,of an approximation to this order has been called taste by modern
1791,I,writers.  Every man in the infancy of art observes an order which
1792,I,approximates more or less closely to that from which this highest
1793,I,"delight results: but the diversity is not sufficiently marked, as"
1794,I,"that its gradations should be sensible, except in those instances"
1795,I,where the predominance of this faculty of approximation to the
1796,I,beautiful (for so we may be permitted to name the relation between
1797,I,this highest pleasure and its cause) is very great. Those in whom
1798,I,"it exists in excess are poets, in the most universal sense of the"
1799,I,word; and the pleasure resulting from the manner in which they
1800,I,"express the influence of society or nature upon their own minds,"
1801,I,"communicates itself to others, and gathers a sort or reduplication"
1802,I,from that community. Their language is vitally metaphorical; that
1803,I,"is, it marks the before unapprehended relations of things and"
1804,I,"perpetuates their apprehension, until the words which represent"
1805,I,"them become, through time, signs for portions or classes of thoughts"
1806,I,instead of pictures of integral thoughts; and then if no new poets
1807,I,should arise to create afresh the associations which have been thus
1808,I,"disorganized, language will be dead to all the nobler purposes of"
1809,I,human intercourse. These similitudes or relations are finely said
1810,I,by Lord Bacon to be 'the same footsteps of nature impressed upon
1811,I,"the various subjects of the world'; [Footnote: De Augment. Scient.,"
1812,I,"cap. i, lib.  iii.] and he considers the faculty which perceives"
1813,I,them as the storehouse of axioms common to all knowledge. In the
1814,I,"infancy of society every author is necessarily a poet, because"
1815,I,language itself is poetry; and to be a poet is to apprehend the
1816,I,"true and the beautiful, in a word, the good which exists in the"
1817,I,"relation, subsisting, first between existence and perception, and"
1818,I,secondly between perception and expression. Every original language
1819,I,near to its source is in itself the chaos of a cyclic poem: the
1820,I,copiousness of lexicography and the distinctions of grammar are the
1821,I,"works of a later age, and are merely the catalogue and the form of"
1822,I,the creations of poetry.
1823,I,
1824,I,"But poets, or those who imagine and express this indestructible"
1825,I,"order, are not only the authors of language and of music, of the"
1826,I,"dance, and architecture, and statuary, and painting; they are the"
1827,I,"institutors of laws, and the founders of civil society, and the"
1828,I,"inventors of the arts of life, and the teachers, who draw into a"
1829,I,"certain propinquity with the beautiful and the true, that partial"
1830,I,apprehension of the agencies of the invisible world which is
1831,I,"called religion. Hence all original religions are allegorical, or"
1832,I,"susceptible of allegory, and, like Janus, have a double face of"
1833,I,"false and true. Poets, according to the circumstances of the age and"
1834,I,"nation in which they appeared, were called, in the earlier epochs"
1835,I,"of the world, legislators, or prophets: a poet essentially comprises"
1836,I,and unites both these characters. For he not only beholds intensely
1837,I,"the present as it is, and discovers those laws according to which"
1838,I,"present things ought to be ordered, but he beholds the future in"
1839,I,"the present, and his thoughts are the germs of the flower and the"
1840,I,fruit of latest time. Not that I assert poets to be prophets in
1841,I,"the gross sense of the word, or that they can foretell the form as"
1842,I,surely as they foreknow the spirit of events: such is the pretence
1843,I,"of superstition, which would make poetry an attribute of prophecy,"
1844,I,rather than prophecy an attribute of poetry. A poet participates
1845,I,"in the eternal, the infinite, and the one; as far as relates to"
1846,I,"his conceptions, time and place and number are not. The grammatical"
1847,I,"forms which express the moods of time, and the difference of persons,"
1848,I,"and the distinction of place, are convertible with respect to the"
1849,I,highest poetry without injuring it as poetry; and the choruses of
1850,I,"Aeschylus, and the book of Job, and Dante's Paradise, would afford,"
1851,I,"more than any other writings, examples of this fact, if the limits"
1852,I,"of this essay did not forbid citation. The creations of sculpture,"
1853,I,"painting, and music, are illustrations still more decisive."
1854,I,
1855,I,"Language, colour, form, and religious and civil habits of action,"
1856,I,are all the instruments and materials of poetry; they may be called
1857,I,poetry by that figure of speech which considers the effect as a
1858,I,synonym of the cause. But poetry in a more restricted sense expresses
1859,I,"those arrangements of language, and especially metrical language,"
1860,I,which are created by that imperial faculty; whose throne is curtained
1861,I,within the invisible nature of man. And this springs from the nature
1862,I,"itself of language, which is a more direct representation of the"
1863,I,"actions and passions of our internal being, and is susceptible"
1864,I,"of more various and delicate combinations, than colour, form, or"
1865,I,"motion, and is more plastic and obedient to the control of that"
1866,I,faculty of which it is the creation. For language is arbitrarily
1867,I,produced by the imagination and has relation to thoughts alone;
1868,I,"but all other materials, instruments and conditions of art, have"
1869,I,"relations among each other, which limit and interpose between"
1870,I,"conception and expression The former is as a mirror which reflects,"
1871,I,"the latter as a cloud which enfeebles, the light of which both are"
1872,I,"mediums of communication. Hence the fame of sculptors, painters,"
1873,I,"and musicians, although the intrinsic powers of the great masters"
1874,I,of these arts may yield in no degree to that of those who have
1875,I,"employed language as the hieroglyphic of their thoughts, has never"
1876,I,"equalled that of poets in the restricted sense of the term, as"
1877,I,two performers of equal skill will produce unequal effects from a
1878,I,"guitar and a harp. The fame of legislators and founders of religions,"
1879,I,"so long as their institutions last, alone seems to exceed that of"
1880,I,"poets in the restricted sense; but it can scarcely be a question,"
1881,I,"whether, if we deduct the celebrity which their flattery of the"
1882,I,"gross opinions of the vulgar usually conciliates, together with"
1883,I,"that which belonged to them in their higher character of poets,"
1884,I,any excess will remain.
1885,I,
1886,I,We have thus circumscribed the word poetry within the limits of that
1887,I,art which is the most familiar and the most perfect expression of
1888,I,"the faculty itself. It is necessary, however, to make the circle"
1889,I,"still narrower, and to determine the distinction between measured"
1890,I,and unmeasured language; for the popular division into prose and
1891,I,verse is inadmissible in accurate philosophy.
1892,I,
1893,I,Sounds as well as thoughts have relation both between each other
1894,I,"and towards that which they represent, and a perception of the order"
1895,I,of those relations has always been found connected with a perception
1896,I,of the order of the relations of thoughts. Hence the language of
1897,I,poets has ever affected a certain uniform and harmonious recurrence
1898,I,"of sound, without which it were not poetry, and which is scarcely"
1899,I,"less indispensable to the communication of its influence, than the"
1900,I,"words themselves, without reference to that peculiar order. Hence"
1901,I,the vanity of translation; it were as wise to cast a violet into a
1902,I,crucible that you might discover the formal principle of its colour
1903,I,"and odour, as seek to transfuse from one language into another the"
1904,I,"creations of a poet. The plant must spring again from its seed,"
1905,I,or it will bear no flower--and this is the burthen of the curse of
1906,I,Babel.
1907,I,
1908,I,An observation of the regular mode of the recurrence of harmony
1909,I,"in the language of poetical minds, together with its relation to"
1910,I,"music, produced metre, or a certain system of traditional forms of"
1911,I,harmony and language. Yet it is by no means essential that a poet
1912,I,"should accommodate his language to this traditional form, so that the"
1913,I,"harmony, which is its spirit, be observed. The practice is indeed"
1914,I,"convenient and popular, and to be preferred, especially in such"
1915,I,composition as includes much action: but every great poet must
1916,I,inevitably innovate upon the example of his predecessors in the
1917,I,exact structure of his peculiar versification. The distinction
1918,I,between poets and prose writers is a vulgar error. The distinction
1919,I,between philosophers and poets has been anticipated. Plato was
1920,I,"essentially a poet--the truth and splendour of his imagery, and the"
1921,I,"melody of his language, are the most intense that it is possible"
1922,I,"to conceive. He rejected the measure of the epic, dramatic, and"
1923,I,"lyrical forms, because he sought to kindle a harmony in thoughts"
1924,I,"divested of shape and action, and he forbore to invent any regular"
1925,I,"plan of rhythm which would include, under determinate forms, the"
1926,I,varied pauses of his style. Cicero sought to imitate the cadence
1927,I,"of his periods, but with little success. Lord Bacon was a poet."
1928,I,"[Footnote: See the Filum Labyrinthi, and the Essay on Death"
1929,I,"particularly]. His language has a sweet and majestic rhythm, which"
1930,I,"satisfies the sense, no less than the almost superhuman wisdom"
1931,I,of his philosophy satisfies the intellect; it is a strain which
1932,I,"distends, and then bursts the circumference of the reader's mind,"
1933,I,and pours itself forth together with it into the universal element
1934,I,with which it has perpetual sympathy. All the authors of revolutions
1935,I,"in opinion are not only necessarily poets as they are inventors,"
1936,I,nor even as their words unveil the permanent analogy of things
1937,I,by images which participate in the life of truth; but as their
1938,I,"periods are harmonious and rhythmical, and contain in themselves"
1939,I,the elements of verse; being the echo of the eternal music. Nor are
1940,I,"those supreme poets, who have employed traditional forms of rhythm"
1941,I,"on account of the form and action of their subjects, less capable"
1942,I,"of perceiving and teaching the truth of things, than those who"
1943,I,"have omitted that form. Shakespeare, Dante, and Milton (to confine"
1944,I,ourselves to modern writers) are philosophers of the very loftiest
1945,I,power.
1946,I,
1947,I,A poem is the very image of life expressed in its eternal truth.
1948,I,"There is this difference between a story and a poem, that a story"
1949,I,"is a catalogue of detached facts, which have no other connexion"
1950,I,"than time, place, circumstance, cause and effect; the other is the"
1951,I,creation of actions according to the unchangeable forms of human
1952,I,"nature, as existing in the mind of the Creator, which is itself"
1953,I,"the image of all other minds. The one is partial, and applies only"
1954,I,"to a definite period of time, and a certain combination of events"
1955,I,"which can never again recur; the other is universal, and contains"
1956,I,within itself the germ of a relation to whatever motives or actions
1957,I,"have place in the possible varieties of human nature. Time, which"
1958,I,"destroys the beauty and the use of the story of particular facts,"
1959,I,"stripped of the poetry which should invest them, augments that of"
1960,I,"poetry, and for ever develops new and wonderful applications of the"
1961,I,eternal truth which it contains. Hence epitomes have been called
1962,I,the moths of just history; they eat out the poetry of it. A story
1963,I,of particular facts is as a mirror which obscures and distorts that
1964,I,which should be beautiful: poetry is a mirror which makes beautiful
1965,I,that which is distorted.
1966,I,
1967,I,"The parts of a composition may be poetical, without the composition"
1968,I,as a whole being a poem. A single sentence may be a considered as
1969,I,"a whole, though it may be found in the midst of a series of unassimilated"
1970,I,portions: a single word even may be a spark of inextinguishable
1971,I,"thought. And thus all the great historians, Herodotus, Plutarch,"
1972,I,"Livy, were poets; and although, the plan of these writers, especially"
1973,I,"that of Livy, restrained them; from developing this faculty in"
1974,I,"its highest degree, they made copious and ample amends for their"
1975,I,"subjection, by filling all the interstices of their subjects with"
1976,I,living images.
1977,I,
1978,I,"Having determined what is poetry, and who are poets, let us proceed"
1979,I,to estimate its effects upon society.
1980,I,
1981,I,Poetry is ever accompanied with pleasure: all spirits on which it
1982,I,falls open themselves to receive the wisdom which is mingled with
1983,I,"its delight. In the infancy of the world, neither poets themselves"
1984,I,nor their auditors are fully aware of the excellence of poetry:
1985,I,"for it acts in a divine and unapprehended manner, beyond and above"
1986,I,consciousness; and it is reserved for future generations to contemplate
1987,I,and measure the mighty cause and effect in all the strength and
1988,I,"splendour of their union. Even in modern times, no living poet ever"
1989,I,arrived at the fullness of his fame; the jury which sits in judgement
1990,I,"upon a poet, belonging as he does to all time, must be composed"
1991,I,of his peers: it must be impanelled by Time from the selectest of
1992,I,"the wise of many generations. A poet is a nightingale, who sits"
1993,I,in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds;
1994,I,his auditors are as men entranced by the melody of an unseen
1995,I,"musician, who feel that they are moved and softened, yet know not"
1996,I,whence or why. The poems of Homer and his contemporaries were the
1997,I,delight of infant Greece; they were the elements of that social
1998,I,system which is the column upon which all succeeding civilization
1999,I,has reposed. Homer embodied the ideal perfection of his age in
2000,I,human character; nor can we doubt that those who read his verses
2001,I,"were awakened to an ambition of becoming like to Achilles, Hector,"
2002,I,"and Ulysses the truth and beauty of friendship, patriotism, and"
2003,I,"persevering devotion to an object, were unveiled to the depths in"
2004,I,these immortal creations: the sentiments of the auditors must have
2005,I,been refined and enlarged by a sympathy with such great and lovely
2006,I,"impersonations, until from admiring they imitated, and from imitation"
2007,I,they identified themselves with the objects of their admiration.
2008,I,"Nor let it be objected, that these characters are remote from moral"
2009,I,"perfection, and that they can by no means be considered as edifying"
2010,I,"patterns for general imitation. Every epoch, under names more"
2011,I,"or less specious, has deified its peculiar errors; Revenge is the"
2012,I,naked idol of the worship of a semi-barbarous age; and Self-deceit
2013,I,"is the veiled image of unknown evil, before which luxury and satiety"
2014,I,lie prostrate. But a poet considers the vices of his contemporaries
2015,I,"as a temporary dress in which his creations must be arrayed, and"
2016,I,which cover without concealing the eternal proportions of their
2017,I,beauty. An epic or dramatic personage is understood to wear them
2018,I,"around his soul, as he may the ancient armour or the modern uniform"
2019,I,around his body; whilst it is easy to conceive a dress more graceful
2020,I,than either. The beauty of the internal nature cannot be so far
2021,I,"concealed by its accidental vesture, but that the spirit of its"
2022,I,"form shall communicate itself to the very disguise, and indicate"
2023,I,the shape it hides from the manner in which it is worn. A majestic
2024,I,form and graceful motions will express themselves through the most
2025,I,barbarous and tasteless costume. Few poets of the highest class
2026,I,have chosen to exhibit the beauty of their conceptions in its
2027,I,naked truth and splendour; and it is doubtful whether the alloy
2028,I,"of costume, habit, &c., be not necessary to temper this planetary"
2029,I,music for mortal ears.
2030,I,
2031,I,"The whole objection, however, of the immorality of poetry rests"
2032,I,upon a misconception of the manner in which poetry acts to produce
2033,I,the moral improvement of man. Ethical science arranges the elements
2034,I,"which poetry has created, and propounds schemes and proposes"
2035,I,examples of civil and domestic life: nor is it for want of admirable
2036,I,"doctrines that men hate, and despise, and censure, and deceive,"
2037,I,and subjugate one another. But poetry acts in another and diviner
2038,I,manner. It awakens and enlarges the mind itself by rendering it
2039,I,the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations of thought.
2040,I,"Poetry lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the world, and makes"
2041,I,familiar objects be as if they were not familiar; it reproduces all
2042,I,"that it represents, and the impersonations clothed in its Elysian"
2043,I,light stand thenceforward in the minds of those who have once
2044,I,contemplated them as memorials of that gentle and exalted content
2045,I,which extends itself over all thoughts and actions with which it
2046,I,coexists. The great secret of morals is love; or a going out of our
2047,I,"own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the beautiful"
2048,I,"which exists in thought, action, or person, not our own. A man,"
2049,I,"to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he"
2050,I,must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the
2051,I,pains and pleasures of his species must become his own. The great
2052,I,instrument of moral good is the imagination; and poetry administers
2053,I,to the effect by acting upon the cause. Poetry enlarges the
2054,I,circumference of the imagination by replenishing it with thought of
2055,I,"ever new delight, which have the power of attracting and assimilating"
2056,I,"to their own nature all other thoughts, and which form new intervals"
2057,I,and interstices whose void for ever craves fresh food. Poetry
2058,I,strengthens the faculty which is the organ of the moral nature
2059,I,"of man, in the same manner as exercise strengthens a limb. A poet"
2060,I,therefore would do ill to embody his own conceptions of right and
2061,I,"wrong, which are usually those of his place and time, in his poetical"
2062,I,"creations, which participate in neither By this assumption of the"
2063,I,inferior office of interpreting the effect in which perhaps after
2064,I,"all he might acquit himself but imperfectly, he would resign a"
2065,I,glory in a participation in the cause. There was little danger that
2066,I,"Homer, or any of the eternal poets should have so far misunderstood"
2067,I,themselves as to have abdicated this throne of their widest dominion.
2068,I,"Those in whom the poetical faculty, though great, is less intense,"
2069,I,"as Euripides, Lucan, Tasso, Spenser, have frequently affected a"
2070,I,"moral aim, and the effect of their poetry is diminished in exact"
2071,I,proportion to the degree in which they compel us to advert to this
2072,I,purpose.
2073,I,
2074,I,
2075,I,Homer and the cyclic poets were followed at a certain interval
2076,I,"by the dramatic and lyrical poets of Athens, who flourished"
2077,I,contemporaneously with all that is most perfect in the kindred
2078,I,"expressions of the poetical faculty; architecture, painting, music"
2079,I,"the dance, sculpture, philosophy, and, we may add, the forms of"
2080,I,civil life. For although the scheme of Athenian society was deformed
2081,I,by many imperfections which the poetry existing in chivalry and
2082,I,Christianity has erased from the habits and institutions of modern
2083,I,"Europe; yet never at any other period has so much energy, beauty,"
2084,I,"and virtue, been developed; never was blind strength and stubborn"
2085,I,"form so disciplined and rendered subject to the will of man, or"
2086,I,that will less repugnant to the dictates of the beautiful and the
2087,I,"true, as during the century which preceded the death of Socrates."
2088,I,Of no other epoch in the history of our species have we records
2089,I,and fragments stamped so visibly with the image of the divinity in
2090,I,"man. But it is poetry alone, in form, in action, or in language,"
2091,I,"which has rendered this epoch memorable above all others, and the"
2092,I,storehouse of examples to everlasting time. For written poetry
2093,I,"existed at that epoch simultaneously with the other arts, and it is"
2094,I,"an idle inquiry to demand which gave and which received the light,"
2095,I,"which all, as from a common focus, have scattered over the darkest"
2096,I,periods of succeeding time. We know no more of cause and effect than
2097,I,a constant conjunction of events: poetry is ever found to coexist
2098,I,with whatever other arts contribute to the happiness and perfection
2099,I,of man. I appeal to what has already been established to distinguish
2100,I,between the cause and the effect.
2101,I,
2102,I,"It was at the period here adverted to, that the drama had its birth;"
2103,I,and however a succeeding writer may have equalled or surpassed
2104,I,those few great specimens of the Athenian drama which have been
2105,I,"preserved to us, it is indisputable that the art itself never was"
2106,I,"understood or practised according to the true philosophy of it,"
2107,I,"as at Athens. For the Athenians employed language, action, music,"
2108,I,"painting, the dance, and religious institutions, to produce a common"
2109,I,effect in the representation of the highest idealisms of passion
2110,I,and of power; each division in the art was made perfect in its kind
2111,I,"by artists of the most consummate skill, and was disciplined into"
2112,I,a beautiful proportion and unity one towards the other. On the modern
2113,I,stage a few only of the elements capable of expressing the image
2114,I,of the poet's conception are employed at once. We have tragedy
2115,I,without music and dancing; and music and dancing without the highest
2116,I,"impersonations of which they are the fit accompaniment, and both"
2117,I,without religion and solemnity. Religious institution has indeed
2118,I,been usually banished from the stage. Our system of divesting the
2119,I,"actor's face of a mask, on which the many expressions appropriated"
2120,I,to his dramatic character might be moulded into one permanent
2121,I,"and unchanging expression, is favourable only to a partial and"
2122,I,"inharmonious effect; it is fit for nothing but a monologue, where"
2123,I,all the attention may be directed to some great master of ideal
2124,I,"mimicry. The modern practice of blending comedy with tragedy,"
2125,I,"though liable to great abuse in point of practice, is undoubtedly"
2126,I,an extension of the dramatic circle; but the comedy should be
2127,I,"as in KING LEAR, universal, ideal, and sublime. It is perhaps the"
2128,I,intervention of this principle which determines the balance in
2129,I,"favour of KING LEAR against the OEDIPUS TYRANNUS or the AGAMEMNON,"
2130,I,"or, if you will, the trilogies with which they are connected; unless"
2131,I,"the intense power of the choral poetry, especially that of the"
2132,I,"latter, should be considered as restoring the equilibrium. KING"
2133,I,"LEAR, if it can sustain this comparison, may be judged to be the"
2134,I,most perfect specimen of the dramatic art existing in the world;
2135,I,in spite of the narrow conditions to which the poet was subjected
2136,I,by the ignorance of the philosophy of the drama which has prevailed
2137,I,"in modern Europe. Calderon, in his religious AUTOS, has attempted"
2138,I,to fulfil some of the high conditions of dramatic representation
2139,I,neglected by Shakespeare; such as the establishing a relation
2140,I,between the drama and religion and the accommodating them to music
2141,I,and dancing; but he omits the observation of conditions still
2142,I,"more important, and more is lost than gained by the substitution"
2143,I,of the rigidly-defined and ever-repeated idealisms of a distorted
2144,I,superstition for the living impersonations of the truth of human
2145,I,passion.
2146,I,
2147,I,But I digress.--The connexion of scenic exhibitions with the
2148,I,"improvement or corruption of the manners of men, has been universally"
2149,I,"recognized: in other words, the presence or absence of poetry in"
2150,I,"its most perfect and universal form, has been found to be connected"
2151,I,with good and evil in conduct or habit. The corruption which has
2152,I,"been imputed to the drama as an effect, begins when the poetry"
2153,I,employed in its constitution ends: I appeal to the history of manners
2154,I,whether the periods of the growth of the one and the decline of the
2155,I,other have not corresponded with an exactness equal to any example
2156,I,of moral cause and effect.
2157,I,
2158,I,"The drama at Athens, or wheresoever else it may have approached"
2159,I,"to its perfection, ever co-existed with the moral and intellectual"
2160,I,greatness of the age. The tragedies of the Athenian poets are
2161,I,"as mirrors in which the spectator beholds himself, under a thin"
2162,I,"disguise of circumstance, stript of all but that ideal perfection"
2163,I,and energy which every one feels to be the internal type of all that
2164,I,"he loves, admires, and would become. The imagination is enlarged"
2165,I,"by a sympathy with pains and passions so mighty, that they distend"
2166,I,in their conception the capacity of that by which they are conceived;
2167,I,"the good affections are strengthened by pity, indignation, terror,"
2168,I,and sorrow; and an exalted calm is prolonged from the satiety of
2169,I,this high exercise of them into the tumult of familiar life: even
2170,I,crime is disarmed of half its horror and all its contagion by being
2171,I,represented as the fatal consequence of the unfathomable agencies
2172,I,of nature; error is thus divested of its wilfulness; men can no
2173,I,longer cherish it as the creation of their choice. In a drama of
2174,I,the highest order there is little food for censure or hatred; it
2175,I,teaches rather self-knowledge and self-respect. Neither the eye
2176,I,"nor the mind can see itself, unless reflected upon that which it"
2177,I,"resembles. The drama, so long as it continues to express poetry, is"
2178,I,"as a prismatic and many-sided mirror, which collects the brightest"
2179,I,rays of human nature and divides and reproduces them from the
2180,I,"simplicity of these elementary forms, and touches them with majesty"
2181,I,"and beauty, and multiplies all that it reflects, and endows it with"
2182,I,the power of propagating its like wherever it may fall.
2183,I,
2184,I,"But in periods of the decay of social life, the drama sympathizes"
2185,I,with that decay. Tragedy becomes a cold imitation of the form of
2186,I,"the great masterpieces of antiquity, divested of all harmonious"
2187,I,accompaniment of the kindred arts; and often the very form
2188,I,"misunderstood, or a weak attempt to teach certain doctrines, which"
2189,I,the writer considers as moral truths; and which are usually no
2190,I,"more than specious flatteries of some gross vice or weakness, with"
2191,I,"which the author, in common with his auditors, are infected. Hence"
2192,I,what has been called the classical and domestic drama. Addison's
2193,I,CATO is a specimen of the one; and would it were not superfluous
2194,I,to cite examples of the other! To such purposes poetry cannot be
2195,I,"made subservient. Poetry is a sword of lightning, ever unsheathed,"
2196,I,which consumes the scabbard that would contain it. And thus we
2197,I,observe that all dramatic writings of this nature are unimaginative
2198,I,"in a singular degree; they affect sentiment and passion, which,"
2199,I,"divested of imagination, are other names for caprice and appetite."
2200,I,The period in our own history of the grossest degradation of the
2201,I,"drama is the reign of Charles II, when all forms in which poetry"
2202,I,had been accustomed to be expressed became hymns to the triumph of
2203,I,kingly power over liberty and virtue. Milton stood alone illuminating
2204,I,an age unworthy of him. At such periods the calculating principle
2205,I,"pervades all the forms of dramatic exhibition, and poetry ceases"
2206,I,to be expressed upon them. Comedy loses its ideal universality:
2207,I,"wit succeeds to humour; we laugh from self-complacency and triumph,"
2208,I,"instead of pleasure; malignity, sarcasm, and contempt, succeed to"
2209,I,"sympathetic merriment; we hardly laugh, but we Obscenity, which"
2210,I,"is ever blasphemy against the divine beauty in life, becomes, from"
2211,I,"the very veil which it assumes, more active if less disgusting: it"
2212,I,is a monster for which the corruption of society for ever brings
2213,I,"forth new food, which it devours in secret."
2214,I,
2215,I,The drama being that form under which a greater number of modes
2216,I,of expression of poetry are susceptible of being combined than any
2217,I,"other, the connexion of poetry and social good is more observable"
2218,I,in the drama than in whatever other form. And it is indisputable
2219,I,that the highest perfection of human society has ever corresponded
2220,I,with the highest dramatic excellence; and that the corruption or the
2221,I,"extinction of the drama in a nation where it has once flourished,"
2222,I,is a mark of a corruption of manners and an extinction of the
2223,I,"energies which sustain the soul of social life. But, as Machiavelli"
2224,I,"says of political institutions, that life may be preserved and"
2225,I,"renewed, if men should arise capable of bringing back the drama"
2226,I,to its principles. And this is true with respect to poetry in its
2227,I,"most extended sense: all language, institution and form, require not"
2228,I,only to be produced but to be sustained: the office and character
2229,I,"of a poet participates in the divine nature as regards providence,"
2230,I,no less than as regards creation.
2231,I,
2232,I,"Civil war, the spoils of Asia, and the fatal predominance first of"
2233,I,"the Macedonian, and then of the Roman arms, were so many symbols"
2234,I,of the extinction or suspension of the creative faculty in Greece.
2235,I,"The bucolic writers, who found patronage under the lettered tyrants"
2236,I,"of Sicily and Egypt, were the latest representatives of its most"
2237,I,"glorious reign. Their poetry is intensely melodious, like the odour"
2238,I,"of the tuberose, it overcomes and sickens the spirit with excess"
2239,I,of sweetness; whilst the poetry of the preceding age was as a
2240,I,"meadow-gale of June, which mingles the fragrance all the flowers"
2241,I,"of the field, and adds a quickening and harmonizing spirit of its"
2242,I,"own, which endows the sense with a power of sustaining its extreme"
2243,I,delight. The bucolic and erotic delicacy in written poetry is
2244,I,"correlative with that softness in statuary, music and the kindred"
2245,I,"arts, and even in manners and institutions, which distinguished the"
2246,I,"epoch to which I now refer. Nor is it the poetical faculty itself,"
2247,I,"or any misapplication of it, to which this want of harmony is to"
2248,I,be imputed. An equal sensibility to the influence of the senses
2249,I,and the affections is to be found in the writings of Homer and
2250,I,"Sophocles: the former, especially, has clothed sensual and pathetic"
2251,I,images with irresistible attractions. Their superiority over these
2252,I,succeeding writers consists in the presence of those thoughts which
2253,I,"belong to the inner faculties of our nature, not in the absence"
2254,I,of those which are connected with the external: their incomparable
2255,I,perfection consists in a harmony of the union of all.  It is not
2256,I,"what the erotic poets have, but what they have not, in which their"
2257,I,"imperfection consists. It is not inasmuch as they were poets, but"
2258,I,"inasmuch as they were not poets, that they can be considered with"
2259,I,any plausibility as connected with the corruption of their age. Had
2260,I,that corruption availed so as to extinguish in them the sensibility
2261,I,"to pleasure, passion, and natural scenery, which is imputed to them"
2262,I,"as an imperfection, the last triumph of evil would have been achieved."
2263,I,For the end of social corruption is to destroy all sensibility
2264,I,"to pleasure; and, therefore, it is corruption. It begins at the"
2265,I,"imagination and the intellect as at the core, and distributes itself"
2266,I,"thence as a paralysing venom, through the affections into the very"
2267,I,"appetites, until all become a torpid mass in which hardly sense"
2268,I,"survives. At the approach of such a period, poetry ever addresses"
2269,I,"itself to those faculties which are the last to be destroyed, and"
2270,I,"its voice is heard, like the footsteps of Astraea, departing from"
2271,I,the world. Poetry ever communicates all the pleasure which men
2272,I,are capable of receiving: it is ever still the light of life; the
2273,I,source of whatever of beautiful or generous or true can have place
2274,I,in an evil time. It will readily be confessed that those among the
2275,I,"luxurious citizens of Syracuse and Alexandria, who were delighted"
2276,I,"with the poems of Theocritus, were less cold, cruel, and sensual"
2277,I,than the remnant of their tribe. But corruption must utterly have
2278,I,destroyed the fabric of human society before poetry can ever cease.
2279,I,"The sacred links of that chain have never been entirely disjoined,"
2280,I,which descending through the minds of many men is attached to those
2281,I,"great minds, whence as from a magnet the invisible effluence is"
2282,I,"sent forth, which at once connects, animates, and sustains the life"
2283,I,of all. It is the faculty which contains within itself the seeds
2284,I,at once of its own and of social renovation.  And let us not
2285,I,circumscribe the effects of the bucolic and erotic poetry within
2286,I,the limits of the sensibility of those to whom it was addressed.
2287,I,"They may have perceived the beauty of those immortal compositions,"
2288,I,simply as fragments and isolated portions: those who are more
2289,I,"finely organized, or born in a happier age, may recognize them as"
2290,I,"episodes to that great poem, which all poets, like the cooperating"
2291,I,"thoughts of one great mind, have built up since the beginning of"
2292,I,the world.
2293,I,
2294,I,The same revolutions within a narrower sphere had place in ancient
2295,I,Rome; but the actions and forms of its social life never seem to
2296,I,have been perfectly saturated with the poetical element. The Romans
2297,I,appear to have considered the Greeks as the selectest treasuries
2298,I,"of the selectest forms of manners and of nature, and to have"
2299,I,"abstained from creating in measured language, sculpture, music, or"
2300,I,"architecture, anything which might bear a particular relation to"
2301,I,"their own condition, whilst it should bear a general one to the"
2302,I,universal constitution of the world. But we judge from partial
2303,I,"evidence, and we judge perhaps partially Ennius, Varro, Pacuvius,"
2304,I,"and Accius, all great poets, have been lost. Lucretius is in the"
2305,I,"highest, and Virgil in a very high sense, a creator. The chosen"
2306,I,"delicacy of expressions of the latter, are as a mist of light which"
2307,I,conceal from us the intense and exceeding truth of his conceptions
2308,I,"of nature. Livy is instinct with poetry. Yet Horace, Catullus,"
2309,I,"Ovid, and generally the other great writers of the Virgilian age,"
2310,I,"saw man and nature in the mirror of Greece. The institutions also,"
2311,I,"and the religion of Rome were less poetical than those of Greece,"
2312,I,as the shadow is less vivid than the substance. Hence poetry in
2313,I,"Rome, seemed to follow, rather than accompany, the perfection of"
2314,I,political and domestic society. The true poetry of Rome lived in
2315,I,"its institutions; for whatever of beautiful, true, and majestic,"
2316,I,"they contained, could have sprung only from the faculty which creates"
2317,I,"the order in which they consist. The life of Camillus, the death of"
2318,I,"Regulus; the expectation of the senators, in their godlike state,"
2319,I,of the victorious Gauls: the refusal of the republic to make peace
2320,I,"with Hannibal, after the battle of Cannae, were not the consequences"
2321,I,of a refined calculation of the probable personal advantage to
2322,I,"result from such a rhythm and order in the shows of life, to those"
2323,I,who were at once the poets and the actors of these immortal dramas.
2324,I,"The imagination beholding the beauty of this order, created it out"
2325,I,"of itself according to its own idea; the consequence was empire,"
2326,I,and the reward everliving fame. These things are not the less poetry
2327,I,quid carent vate sacro. They are the episodes of that cyclic poem
2328,I,"written by Time upon the memories of men. The Past, like an inspired"
2329,I,"rhapsodist, fills the theatre of everlasting generations with their"
2330,I,harmony.
2331,I,
2332,I,At length the ancient system of religion and manners had fulfilled
2333,I,the circle of its revolutions. And the world would have fallen into
2334,I,"utter anarchy and darkness, but that there were found poets among"
2335,I,the authors of the Christian and chivalric systems of manners and
2336,I,"religion, who created forms of opinion and action never before"
2337,I,"conceived; which, copied into the imaginations of men, become as"
2338,I,generals to the bewildered armies of their thoughts. It is foreign
2339,I,to the present purpose to touch upon the evil produced by these
2340,I,"systems: except that we protest, on the ground of the principles"
2341,I,"already established, that no portion of it can be attributed to"
2342,I,the poetry they contain.
2343,I,
2344,I,"It is probable that the poetry of Moses, Job, David, Solomon, and"
2345,I,"Isaiah, had produced a great effect upon the mind of Jesus and his"
2346,I,disciples. The scattered fragments preserved to us by the biographers
2347,I,"of this extraordinary person, are all instinct with the most vivid"
2348,I,poetry. But his doctrines seem to have been quickly distorted.
2349,I,At a certain period after the prevalence of a system of opinions
2350,I,"founded upon those promulgated by him, the three forms into which"
2351,I,Plato had distributed the faculties of mind underwent a sort of
2352,I,"apotheosis, and became the object of the worship of the civilized"
2353,I,"world. Here it is to be confessed that 'Light seems to thicken,'"
2354,I,and
2355,I,
2356,I,"The crow makes wing to the rooky wood,"
2357,I,"Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,"
2358,I,And night's black agents to their preys do rouze.
2359,I,
2360,I,But mark how beautiful an order has sprung from the dust and
2361,I,"blood of this fierce chaos! how the world, as from a resurrection,"
2362,I,"balancing itself on the golden wings of knowledge and of hope, has"
2363,I,reassumed its yet unwearied flight into the heaven of time. Listen
2364,I,"to the music, unheard by outward ears, which is as a ceaseless and"
2365,I,"invisible wind, nourishing its everlasting course with strength"
2366,I,and swiftness.
2367,I,
2368,I,"The poetry in the doctrines of Jesus Christ, and the mythology and"
2369,I,"institutions of the Celtic conquerors of the Roman empire, outlived"
2370,I,the darkness and the convulsions connected with their growth and
2371,I,"victory, and blended themselves in a new fabric of manners and"
2372,I,opinion. It is an error to impute the ignorance of the dark ages to
2373,I,the Christian doctrines or the predominance of the Celtic nations.
2374,I,Whatever of evil their agencies may have contained sprang from the
2375,I,"extinction of the poetical principle, connected with the progress"
2376,I,"of despotism and superstition. Men, from causes too intricate to be"
2377,I,"here discussed, had become insensible and selfish: their own will"
2378,I,"had become feeble, and yet they were its slaves, and thence the"
2379,I,"slaves of the will of others: lust, fear, avarice, cruelty, and"
2380,I,"fraud, characterized a race amongst whom no one was to be found"
2381,I,"capable of CREATING in form, language, or institution. The moral"
2382,I,anomalies of such a state of society are not justly to be charged
2383,I,"upon any class of events immediately connected with them, and those"
2384,I,events are most entitled to our approbation which could dissolve
2385,I,it most expeditiously. It is unfortunate for those who cannot
2386,I,"distinguish words from thoughts, that many of these anomalies have"
2387,I,been incorporated into our popular religion.
2388,I,
2389,I,It was not until the eleventh century that the effects of the
2390,I,poetry of the Christian and chivalric systems began to manifest
2391,I,themselves.  The principle of equality had been discovered and
2392,I,"applied by Plato in his Republic, as the theoretical rule of the"
2393,I,"mode in which the materials of pleasure and of power, produced by"
2394,I,"the common skill and labour of human beings, ought to be distributed"
2395,I,among them. The limitations of this rule were asserted by him
2396,I,"to be determined only by the sensibility of each, or the utility"
2397,I,"to result to all. Plato, following the doctrines of Timaeus and"
2398,I,"Pythagoras, taught also a moral and intellectual system of doctrine,"
2399,I,"comprehending at once the past, the present, and the future condition"
2400,I,of man. Jesus Christ divulged the sacred and eternal truths contained
2401,I,"in these views to mankind, and Christianity, in its abstract purity,"
2402,I,became the exoteric expression of the esoteric doctrines of the
2403,I,poetry and wisdom of antiquity. The incorporation of the Celtic
2404,I,"nations with the exhausted population of the south, impressed"
2405,I,upon it the figure of the poetry existing in their mythology and
2406,I,institutions. The result was a sum of the action and reaction of
2407,I,all the causes included in it; for it may be assumed as a maxim that
2408,I,no nation or religion can supersede any other without incorporating
2409,I,into itself a portion of that which it supersedes. The abolition of
2410,I,"personal and domestic slavery, and the emancipation of women from"
2411,I,"a great part of the degrading restraints of antiquity, were among"
2412,I,the consequences of these events.
2413,I,
2414,I,The abolition of personal slavery is the basis of the highest
2415,I,political hope that it can enter into the mind of man to conceive.
2416,I,The freedom of women produced the poetry of sexual love.  Love
2417,I,"became a religion, the idols of whose worship were ever present."
2418,I,It was as if the statues of Apollo and the Muses had been endowed
2419,I,"with life and motion, and had walked forth among their worshippers;"
2420,I,so that earth became peopled by the inhabitants of a diviner world.
2421,I,The familiar appearance and proceedings of life became wonderful
2422,I,"and heavenly, and a paradise was created as out of the wrecks of"
2423,I,"Eden. And as this creation itself is poetry, so its creators were"
2424,I,poets; and language was the instrument of their art: 'Galeotto fu
2425,I,"il libro, e chi lo scrisse.' The Provencal Trouveurs, or inventors,"
2426,I,"preceded Petrarch, whose verses are as spells, which unseal the"
2427,I,inmost enchanted fountains of the delight which is in the grief of
2428,I,love. It is impossible to feel them without becoming a portion of
2429,I,that beauty which we contemplate: it were superfluous to explain
2430,I,how the gentleness and the elevation of mind connected with these
2431,I,"sacred emotions can render men more amiable, more generous and wise,"
2432,I,and lift them out of the dull vapours of the little world of self.
2433,I,Dante understood the secret things of love even more than Petrarch.
2434,I,His Vita Nuova is an inexhaustible fountain of purity of sentiment
2435,I,"and language: it is the idealized history of that period, and those"
2436,I,intervals of his life which were dedicated to love. His apotheosis
2437,I,"of Beatrice in Paradise, and the gradations of his own love and her"
2438,I,"loveliness, by which as by steps he feigns himself to have ascended"
2439,I,"to the throne of the Supreme Cause, is the most glorious imagination"
2440,I,of modern poetry. The acutest critics have justly reversed the
2441,I,"judgement of the vulgar, and the order of the great acts of the"
2442,I,"'Divine Drama', in the measure of the admiration which they accord"
2443,I,"to the Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. The latter is a perpetual"
2444,I,"hymn of everlasting love. Love, which found a worthy poet in Plato"
2445,I,"alone of all the ancients, has been celebrated by a chorus of the"
2446,I,greatest writers of the renovated world; and the music has penetrated
2447,I,"the caverns of society, and its echoes still drown the dissonance"
2448,I,"of arms and superstition. At successive intervals, Ariosto, Tasso,"
2449,I,"Shakespeare, Spenser, Calderon, Rousseau, and the great writers"
2450,I,"of our own age, have celebrated the dominion of love, planting"
2451,I,as it were trophies in the human mind of that sublimest victory
2452,I,over sensuality and force. The true relation borne to each other
2453,I,"by the sexes into which human kind is distributed, has become"
2454,I,less misunderstood; and if the error which confounded diversity
2455,I,with inequality of the powers of the two sexes has been partially
2456,I,"recognized in the opinions and institutions of modern Europe, we"
2457,I,owe this great benefit to the worship of which chivalry was the
2458,I,"law, and poets the prophets."
2459,I,
2460,I,The poetry of Dante may be considered as the bridge thrown over
2461,I,"the stream of time, which unites the modern and ancient world. The"
2462,I,distorted notions of invisible things which Dante and his rival
2463,I,"Milton have idealized, are merely the mask and the mantle in which"
2464,I,these great poets walk through eternity enveloped and disguised.
2465,I,It is a difficult question to determine how far they were conscious
2466,I,of the distinction which must have subsisted in their minds between
2467,I,their own creeds and that of the people. Dante at least appears to
2468,I,"wish to mark the full extent of it by placing Riphaeus, whom Virgil"
2469,I,"calls justissimns unus, in Paradise, and observing a most heretical"
2470,I,caprice in his distribution of rewards and punishments. And Milton's
2471,I,poem contains within itself a philosophical refutation of that
2472,I,"system, of which by a strange and natural antithesis, it has been"
2473,I,a chief popular support. Nothing can exceed the energy and magnificence
2474,I,of the character of Satan as expressed in Paradise Lost. It is a
2475,I,mistake to suppose that he could ever have been intended for the
2476,I,"popular personification of evil. Implacable hate, patient cunning,"
2477,I,and a sleepless refinement of device to inflict the extremest
2478,I,"anguish on an enemy, these things are evil; and, although venial"
2479,I,in a slave are not to be forgiven in a tyrant; although redeemed
2480,I,"by much that ennobles his defeat in one subdued, are marked by"
2481,I,all that dishonours his conquest in the victor. Milton's Devil as
2482,I,"a moral being is as far superior to his God, as one who perseveres"
2483,I,in some purpose which he has conceived to be excellent in spite of
2484,I,"adversity and torture, is to one who in the cold security of undoubted"
2485,I,"triumph inflicts the most horrible revenge upon his enemy, not from"
2486,I,any mistaken notion of inducing him to repent of a perseverance in
2487,I,"enmity, but with the alleged design of exasperating him to deserve"
2488,I,new torments. Milton has so far violated the popular creed (if this
2489,I,shall be judged to be a violation) as to have alleged no superiority
2490,I,of moral virtue to his God over his Devil. And this bold neglect of
2491,I,a direct moral purpose is the most decisive proof of the supremacy
2492,I,of Milton's genius.  He mingled as it were the elements of human
2493,I,"nature as colours upon a single pallet, and arranged them in the"
2494,I,composition of his great picture according to the laws of epic
2495,I,"truth; that is, according to the laws of that principle by which a"
2496,I,series of actions of the external universe and of intelligent and
2497,I,ethical beings is calculated to excite the sympathy of succeeding
2498,I,generations of mankind. The Divina Commedia and Paradise Lost have
2499,I,conferred upon modern mythology a systematic form; and when change
2500,I,and time shall have added one more superstition to the mass of
2501,I,"those which have arisen and decayed upon the earth, commentators"
2502,I,will be learnedly employed in elucidating the religion of ancestral
2503,I,"Europe, only not utterly forgotten because it will have been stamped"
2504,I,with the eternity of genius.
2505,I,
2506,I,"Homer was the first and Dante the second epic poet: that is,"
2507,I,"the second poet, the series of whose creations bore a defined and"
2508,I,intelligible relation to the knowledge and sentiment and religion
2509,I,"of the age in which he lived, and of the ages which followed it:"
2510,I,developing itself in correspondence with their development. For
2511,I,Lucretius had limed the wings of his swift spirit in the dregs of
2512,I,"the sensible world; and Virgil, with a modesty that ill became his"
2513,I,"genius, had affected the fame of an imitator, even whilst he created"
2514,I,"anew all that he copied; and none among the flock of mock-birds,"
2515,I,"though their notes were sweet, Apollonius Rhodius, Quintus Calaber,"
2516,I,"Nonnus, Lucan, Statius, or Claudian, have sought even to fulfil"
2517,I,a single condition of epic truth. Milton was the third epic poet.
2518,I,For if the title of epic in its highest sense be refused to the
2519,I,"Aeneid, still less can it be conceded to the Orlando Furioso, the"
2520,I,"Gerusalemme Liberata, the Lusiad, or the Fairy Queen."
2521,I,
2522,I,Dante and Milton were both deeply penetrated with the ancient
2523,I,religion of the civilized world; and its spirit exists in their
2524,I,poetry probably in the same proportion as its forms survived in
2525,I,the unreformed worship of modern Europe. The one preceded and the
2526,I,other followed the Reformation at almost equal intervals. Dante
2527,I,"was the first religious reformer, and Luther surpassed him rather"
2528,I,"in the rudeness and acrimony, than in the boldness of his censures"
2529,I,of papal usurpation. Dante was the first awakener of entranced
2530,I,"Europe; he created a language, in itself music and persuasion, out"
2531,I,of a chaos of inharmonious barbarisms. He was the congregator of
2532,I,those great spirits who presided over the resurrection of learning;
2533,I,the Lucifer of that starry flock which in the thirteenth century
2534,I,"shone forth from republican Italy, as from a heaven, into the"
2535,I,darkness of the benighted world. His very words are instinct with
2536,I,"spirit; each is as a spark, a burning atom of inextinguishable"
2537,I,"thought; and many yet lie covered in the ashes of their birth, and"
2538,I,pregnant with a lightning which has yet found no conductor. All
2539,I,"high poetry is infinite; it is as the first acorn, which contained"
2540,I,"all oaks potentially. Veil after veil may be undrawn, and the"
2541,I,inmost naked beauty of the meaning never exposed. A great poem
2542,I,is a fountain for ever overflowing with the waters of wisdom and
2543,I,delight; and after one person and one age has exhausted all its
2544,I,divine effluence which their peculiar relations enable them to
2545,I,"share, another and yet another succeeds, and new relations are ever"
2546,I,"developed, the source of an unforeseen and an unconceived delight."
2547,I,
2548,I,"The age immediately succeeding to that of Dante, Petrarch, and"
2549,I,"Boccaccio, was characterized by a revival of painting, sculpture,"
2550,I,"and architecture. Chaucer caught the sacred inspiration, and the"
2551,I,superstructure of English literature is based upon the materials
2552,I,of Italian invention.
2553,I,
2554,I,But let us not be betrayed from a defence into a critical history
2555,I,of poetry and its influence on society. Be it enough to have pointed
2556,I,"out the effects of poets, in the large and true sense of the word,"
2557,I,upon their own and all succeeding times.
2558,I,
2559,I,But poets have been challenged to resign the civic crown to reasoners
2560,I,"and mechanists, on another plea. It is admitted that the exercise"
2561,I,"of the imagination is most delightful, but it is alleged that that"
2562,I,of reason is more useful. Let us examine as the grounds of this
2563,I,"distinction, what is here meant by utility. Pleasure or good, in a"
2564,I,"general sense, is that which the consciousness of a sensitive and"
2565,I,"intelligent being seeks, and in which, when found, it acquiesces."
2566,I,"There are two kinds of pleasure, one durable, universal and"
2567,I,permanent; the other transitory and particular. Utility may either
2568,I,express the means of producing the former or the latter. In the
2569,I,"former sense, whatever strengthens and purifies the affections,"
2570,I,"enlarges the imagination, and adds spirit to sense, is useful. But"
2571,I,"a narrower meaning may be assigned to the word utility, confining"
2572,I,it to express that which banishes the importunity of the wants of
2573,I,"our animal nature, the surrounding men with security of life, the"
2574,I,"dispersing the grosser delusions of superstition, and the conciliating"
2575,I,such a degree of mutual forbearance among men as may consist with
2576,I,the motives of personal advantage.
2577,I,
2578,I,"Undoubtedly the promoters of utility, in this limited sense, have"
2579,I,their appointed office in society. They follow the footsteps of
2580,I,"poets, and copy the sketches of their creations into the book of"
2581,I,"common life. They make space, and give time. Their exertions are"
2582,I,"of the highest value, so long as they confine their administration"
2583,I,of the concerns of the inferior powers of our nature within the
2584,I,limits due to the superior ones. But whilst the sceptic destroys
2585,I,"gross superstitions, let him spare to deface, as some of the"
2586,I,"French writers have defaced, the eternal truths charactered upon"
2587,I,"the imaginations of men. Whilst the mechanist abridges, and the"
2588,I,"political economist combines labour, let them beware that their"
2589,I,"speculations, for want of correspondence with those first principles"
2590,I,"which belong to the imagination, do not tend, as they have in"
2591,I,"modern England, to exasperate at once the extremes of luxury and"
2592,I,"want. They have exemplified the saying, 'To him that hath, more"
2593,I,"shall be given; and from him that hath not, the little that he hath"
2594,I,"shall be taken away.' The rich have become richer, and the poor"
2595,I,have become poorer; and the vessel of the state is driven between
2596,I,the Scylla and Charybdis of anarchy and despotism. Such are the
2597,I,effects which must ever flow from an unmitigated exercise of the
2598,I,calculating faculty.
2599,I,
2600,I,It is difficult to define pleasure in its highest sense; the
2601,I,"definition involving a number of apparent paradoxes. For, from an"
2602,I,"inexplicable defect of harmony in the constitution of human nature,"
2603,I,the pain of the inferior is frequently connected with the pleasures
2604,I,"of the superior portions of our being. Sorrow, terror, anguish,"
2605,I,"despair itself, are often the chosen expressions of an approximation"
2606,I,to the highest good. Our sympathy in tragic fiction depends on this
2607,I,principle; tragedy delights by affording a shadow of the pleasure
2608,I,which exists in pain. This is the source also of the melancholy
2609,I,which is inseparable from the sweetest melody. The pleasure that
2610,I,is in sorrow is sweeter than the pleasure of pleasure itself. And
2611,I,"hence the saying, 'It is better to go to the house of mourning, than"
2612,I,to the house of mirth.' Not that this highest species of pleasure
2613,I,"is necessarily linked with pain. The delight of love and friendship,"
2614,I,"the ecstasy of the admiration of nature, the joy of the perception"
2615,I,"and still more of the creation of poetry, is often wholly unalloyed."
2616,I,
2617,I,The production and assurance of pleasure in this highest sense
2618,I,is true utility. Those who produce and preserve this pleasure are
2619,I,poets or poetical philosophers.
2620,I,
2621,I,"The exertions of Locke, Hume, Gibbon, Voltaire, Rousseau, [Footnote:"
2622,I,"Although Rousseau has been thus classed, he was essentially a"
2623,I,"poet. The others, even Voltaire, were mere reasoners.] and their"
2624,I,"disciples, in favour of oppressed and deluded humanity, are entitled"
2625,I,to the gratitude of mankind. Yet it is easy to calculate the degree
2626,I,of moral and intellectual improvement which the world would have
2627,I,"exhibited, had they never lived. A little more nonsense would have"
2628,I,"been talked for a century or two; and perhaps a few more men, women,"
2629,I,"and children, burnt as heretics. We might not at this moment have"
2630,I,been congratulating each other on the abolition of the Inquisition
2631,I,in Spain. But it exceeds all imagination to conceive what would have
2632,I,"been the moral condition of the world if neither Dante, Petrarch,"
2633,I,"Boccaccio, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Calderon, Lord Bacon, nor Milton,"
2634,I,had ever existed; if Raphael and Michael Angelo had never been
2635,I,born; if the Hebrew poetry had never been translated; if a revival
2636,I,of the study of Greek literature had never taken place; if no
2637,I,monuments of ancient sculpture had been handed down to us; and if
2638,I,the poetry of the religion of the ancient world had been extinguished
2639,I,"together with its belief. The human mind could never, except by"
2640,I,"the intervention of these excitements, have been awakened to the"
2641,I,"invention of the grosser sciences, and that application of analytical"
2642,I,"reasoning to the aberrations of society, which it is now attempted"
2643,I,to exalt over the direct expression of the inventive and creative
2644,I,faculty itself.
2645,I,
2646,I,"We have more moral, political and historical wisdom, than we know"
2647,I,how to reduce into practice; we have more scientific and economical
2648,I,knowledge than can be accommodated to the just distribution of the
2649,I,"produce which it multiplies. The poetry in these systems of thought,"
2650,I,is concealed by the accumulation of facts and calculating processes.
2651,I,There is no want of knowledge respecting what is wisest and best
2652,I,"in morals, government, and political economy, or at least, what"
2653,I,is wiser and better than what men now practise and endure. But we
2654,I,"let '_I_ DARE NOT wait upon I WOULD, like the poor cat in the adage.'"
2655,I,We want the creative faculty to imagine that which we know; we
2656,I,want the generous impulse to act that which we imagine; we want the
2657,I,poetry of life: our calculations have outrun conception; we have
2658,I,eaten more than we can digest. The cultivation of those sciences
2659,I,which have enlarged the limits of the empire of man over the
2660,I,"external world, has, for want of the poetical faculty, proportionally"
2661,I,"circumscribed those of the internal world; and man, having enslaved"
2662,I,"the elements, remains himself a slave. To what but a cultivation"
2663,I,of the mechanical arts in a degree disproportioned to the presence
2664,I,"of the creative faculty, which is the basis of all knowledge,"
2665,I,is to be attributed the abuse of all invention for abridging and
2666,I,"combining labour, to the exasperation of the inequality of mankind?"
2667,I,From what other cause has it arisen that the discoveries which should
2668,I,"have lightened, have added a weight to the curse imposed on Adam?"
2669,I,"Poetry, and the principle of Self, of which money is the visible,"
2670,I,"incarnation, are the God and Mammon of the world."
2671,I,
2672,I,The functions of the poetical faculty are two-fold; by one it
2673,I,creates new materials of knowledge and power and pleasure; by the
2674,I,other it engenders in the mind a desire to reproduce and arrange
2675,I,them according to a certain rhythm and order which may be called
2676,I,the beautiful and the good. The cultivation of poetry is never more
2677,I,"to be desired than at periods when, from an excess of the selfish"
2678,I,"and calculating principle, the accumulation of the materials of"
2679,I,external life exceed the quantity of the power of assimilating them
2680,I,to the internal laws of human nature. The body has then become too
2681,I,unwieldy for that which animates it.
2682,I,
2683,I,Poetry is indeed something divine. It is at once the centre and
2684,I,"circumference of knowledge; it is that which comprehends all science,"
2685,I,and that to which all science must be referred. It is at the same
2686,I,time the root and blossom of all other systems of thought; it is
2687,I,"that from which all spring, and that which adorns all; and that"
2688,I,"which, if blighted, denies the fruit and the seed, and withholds"
2689,I,from the barren world the nourishment and the succession of the
2690,I,scions of the tree of life. It is the perfect and consummate surface
2691,I,and bloom of all things; it is as the odour and the colour of the
2692,I,"rose to the texture of the elements which compose it, as the form"
2693,I,and splendour of unfaded beauty to the secrets of anatomy and
2694,I,"corruption. What were virtue, love, patriotism, friendship--what"
2695,I,were the scenery of this beautiful universe which we inhabit; what
2696,I,were our consolations on this side of the grave--and what were our
2697,I,"aspirations beyond it, if poetry did not ascend to bring light and"
2698,I,fire from those eternal regions where the owl-winged faculty of
2699,I,"calculation dare not ever soar?  Poetry is not like reasoning, a"
2700,I,power to be exerted according to the determination of the will. A
2701,I,"man cannot say, 'I will compose poetry.' The greatest poet even cannot"
2702,I,"say it; for the mind in creation is as a fading coal, which some"
2703,I,"invisible influence, like an inconstant wind, awakens to transitory"
2704,I,"brightness; this power arises from within, like the colour of a"
2705,I,"flower which fades and changes as it is developed, and the conscious"
2706,I,portions of our natures are unprophetic either of its approach or
2707,I,its departure.  Could this influence be durable in its original
2708,I,"purity and force, it is impossible to predict the greatness of the"
2709,I,"results; but when composition begins, inspiration is already on the"
2710,I,"decline, and the most glorious poetry that has ever been communicated"
2711,I,to the world is probably a feeble shadow of the original conceptions
2712,I,"of the poet. I appeal to the greatest poets of the present day,"
2713,I,whether it is not an error to assert that the finest passages of
2714,I,poetry are produced by labour and study. The toil and the delay
2715,I,"recommended by critics, can be justly interpreted to mean no more"
2716,I,"than a careful observation of the inspired moments, and an artificial"
2717,I,connexion of the spaces between their suggestions by the intertexture
2718,I,of conventional expressions; a necessity only imposed by the
2719,I,limitedness of the poetical faculty itself; for Milton conceived
2720,I,the Paradise Lost as a whole before he executed it in portions; We
2721,I,have his own authority also for the muse having 'dictated' to him
2722,I,the 'unpremeditated song'. And let this be an answer to those who
2723,I,would allege the fifty-six various readings of the first line of
2724,I,the Orlando Furioso. Compositions so produced are to poetry what
2725,I,mosaic is to painting. This instinct and intuition of the poetical
2726,I,"faculty, is still more observable in the plastic and pictorial arts;"
2727,I,a great statue or picture grows under the power of the artist as
2728,I,a child in the mother's womb; and the very mind which directs the
2729,I,hands in formation is incapable of accounting to itself for the
2730,I,"origin, the gradations, or the media of the process."
2731,I,
2732,I,Poetry is the record of the best and happiest moments of the happiest
2733,I,and best minds. We are aware of evanescent visitations of thought
2734,I,"and feeling sometimes associated with place or person, sometimes"
2735,I,"regarding our own mind alone, and always arising unforeseen"
2736,I,"and departing unbidden, but elevating and delightful beyond all"
2737,I,"expression; so that even in the desire and regret they leave, there"
2738,I,"cannot but be pleasure, participating as it does in the nature"
2739,I,of its object. It is as it were the interpenetration of a diviner
2740,I,nature through our own; but its footsteps are like those of a wind
2741,I,"over the sea, which the coming calm erases, and whose traces remain"
2742,I,"only, as on the wrinkled sand which paves it. These and corresponding"
2743,I,conditions of being are experienced principally by those of the
2744,I,most delicate sensibility and the most enlarged imagination; and the
2745,I,state of mind produced by them is at war with every base desire.
2746,I,"The enthusiasm of virtue, love, patriotism, and friendship,"
2747,I,"is essentially linked with such emotions; and whilst they last,"
2748,I,"self appears as what it is, an atom to a universe. Poets are not"
2749,I,only subject to these experiences as spirits of the most refined
2750,I,"organization, but they can colour all that they combine with the"
2751,I,"evanescent hues of this ethereal world; a word, a trait in the"
2752,I,"representation of a scene or a passion, will touch the enchanted"
2753,I,"chord, and reanimate, in those who have ever experienced these"
2754,I,"emotions, the sleeping, the cold, the buried image of the past."
2755,I,Poetry thus makes immortal all that is best and most beautiful in
2756,I,the world; it arrests the vanishing apparitions which haunt the
2757,I,"interlunations of life, and veiling them, or in language or in form,"
2758,I,"sends them forth among mankind, bearing sweet news of kindred joy"
2759,I,"to those with whom their sisters abide--abide, because there is"
2760,I,no portal of expression from the caverns of the spirit which they
2761,I,inhabit into the universe of things. Poetry redeems from decay the
2762,I,visitations of the divinity in man.
2763,I,
2764,I,Poetry turns all things to loveliness; it exalts the beauty of that
2765,I,"which is most beautiful, and it adds beauty to that which is most"
2766,I,"deformed; it marries exultation and horror, grief and pleasure,"
2767,I,"eternity and change; it subdues to union under its light yoke,"
2768,I,"all irreconcilable things. It transmutes all that it touches, and"
2769,I,every form moving within the radiance of its presence is changed
2770,I,by wondrous sympathy to an incarnation of the spirit which it
2771,I,breathes: its secret alchemy turns to potable gold the poisonous
2772,I,waters which flow from death through life; it strips the veil of
2773,I,"familiarity from the world, and lays bare the naked and sleeping"
2774,I,"beauty, which is the spirit of its forms."
2775,I,
2776,I,All things exist as they are perceived; at least in relation to
2777,I,"the percipient. 'The mind is its own place, and of itself can make"
2778,I,"a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.' But poetry defeats the curse"
2779,I,which binds us to be subjected to the accident of surrounding
2780,I,"impressions. And whether it spreads its own figured curtain,"
2781,I,"or withdraws life's dark veil from before the scene of things, it"
2782,I,equally creates for us a being within our being. It makes us the
2783,I,inhabitants of a world to which the familiar world is a chaos.
2784,I,It reproduces the common universe of which we are portions and
2785,I,"percipients, and it purges from our inward sight the film of familiarity"
2786,I,which obscures from us the wonder of our being. It compels us to
2787,I,"feel that which we perceive, and to imagine that which we know. It"
2788,I,"creates anew the universe, after it has been annihilated in our"
2789,I,minds by the recurrence of impressions blunted by reiteration.
2790,I,It justifies the bold and true words of Tasso: Non merita nome di
2791,I,"creatore, se non Iddio ed il Poeta."
2792,I,
2793,I,"A poet, as he is the author to others of the highest wisdom, pleasure,"
2794,I,"virtue and glory, so he ought personally to be the happiest, the"
2795,I,"best, the wisest, and the most illustrious of men. As to his glory,"
2796,I,let time be challenged to declare whether the fame of any other
2797,I,institutor of human life be comparable to that of a poet.  That
2798,I,"he is the wisest, the happiest, and the best, inasmuch as he is"
2799,I,"a poet, is equally incontrovertible: the greatest poets have been"
2800,I,"men of the most spotless virtue, of the most consummate prudence,"
2801,I,"and, if we would look into the interior of their lives, the most"
2802,I,"fortunate of men: and the exceptions, as they regard those who"
2803,I,"possessed the poetic faculty in a high yet inferior degree, will"
2804,I,be found on consideration to confine rather than destroy the rule.
2805,I,"Let us for a moment stoop to the arbitration of popular breath, and"
2806,I,usurping and uniting in our own persons the incompatible characters
2807,I,"of accuser, witness, judge, and executioner, let us decide without"
2808,I,"trial, testimony, or form, that certain motives of those who are"
2809,I,"'there sitting where we dare not soar', are reprehensible. Let"
2810,I,"us assume that Homer was a drunkard, that Virgil was a flatterer,"
2811,I,"that Horace was a coward, that Tasso a madman, that Lord Bacon was"
2812,I,"a peculator, that Raphael was a libertine, that Spenser was a poet"
2813,I,laureate. It is inconsistent with this division of our subject
2814,I,"to cite living poets, but posterity has done ample justice to the"
2815,I,great names now referred to. Their errors have been weighed and found
2816,I,"to have been dust in the balance; if their sins 'were as scarlet,"
2817,I,they are now white as snow'; they have been washed in the blood of
2818,I,"the mediator and redeemer, Time. Observe in what a ludicrous chaos"
2819,I,the imputation of real or fictitious crime have been confused in
2820,I,the contemporary calumnies against poetry and poets; consider how
2821,I,"little is, as it appears--or appears, as it is; look to your own"
2822,I,"motives, and judge not, lest ye be judged."
2823,I,
2824,I,"Poetry, as has been said, differs in this respect from logic, that"
2825,I,"it is not subject to the control of the active powers of the mind,"
2826,I,and that its birth and recurrence have no necessary connexion with
2827,I,the consciousness or will. It is presumptuous  to determine that
2828,I,"these are the necessary conditions of all mental causation, when"
2829,I,mental effects are experienced unsusceptible of being referred to
2830,I,"them. The frequent recurrence of the poetical power, it is obvious"
2831,I,"to suppose, may produce in the mind a habit of order and harmony"
2832,I,correlative with its own nature and its effects upon other minds.
2833,I,"But in the intervals of inspiration, and they may be frequent"
2834,I,"without being durable, a poet becomes a man, and is abandoned to"
2835,I,the sudden reflux of the influences under which others habitually
2836,I,"live.  But as he is more delicately organized than other men, and"
2837,I,"sensible to pain and pleasure, both his own and that of others, in"
2838,I,"a degree unknown to them, he will avoid the one and pursue the other"
2839,I,with an ardour proportioned to this difference. And he renders
2840,I,"himself obnoxious to calumny, when he neglects to observe the"
2841,I,circumstances under which these objects of universal pursuit and
2842,I,flight have disguised themselves in one another's garments.
2843,I,
2844,I,"But there is nothing necessarily evil in this error, and thus"
2845,I,"cruelty, envy, revenge, avarice, and the passions purely evil, have"
2846,I,never formed any portion of the popular imputations on the lives
2847,I,of poets.
2848,I,
2849,I,I have thought it most favourable to the cause of truth to set down
2850,I,these remarks according to the order in which they were suggested
2851,I,"to my mind, by a consideration of the subject itself, instead of"
2852,I,observing the formality of a polemical reply; but if the view which
2853,I,"they contain be just, they will be found to involve a refutation"
2854,I,"of the arguers against poetry, so far at least as regards the first"
2855,I,division of the subject. I can readily conjecture what should have
2856,I,moved the gall of some learned and intelligent writers who quarrel
2857,I,"with certain versifiers; I confess myself, like them, unwilling"
2858,I,"to be stunned, by the Theseids of the hoarse Codri of the day."
2859,I,"Bavius and Maevius undoubtedly are, as they ever were, insufferable"
2860,I,persons. But it belongs to a philosophical critic to distinguish
2861,I,rather than confound.
2862,I,
2863,I,The first part of these remarks has related to poetry in its
2864,I,"elements and principles; and it has been shown, as well as the narrow"
2865,I,"limits assigned them would permit, that what is called poetry, in"
2866,I,"a restricted sense, has a common source with all other forms of order"
2867,I,"and of beauty, according to which the materials of human life are"
2868,I,"susceptible of being arranged, and which is poetry in a universal"
2869,I,sense.
2870,I,
2871,I,The second part will have for its object an application of these
2872,I,"principles to the present state of the cultivation of poetry, and"
2873,I,a defence of the attempt to idealize the modern forms of manners and
2874,I,"opinions, and compel them into a subordination to the imaginative"
2875,I,"and creative faculty. For the literature of England, an energetic"
2876,I,development of which has ever preceded or accompanied a great and
2877,I,"free development of the national will, has arisen as it were from a"
2878,I,new birth. In spite of the low-thoughted envy which would undervalue
2879,I,"contemporary merit, our own will be a memorable age in intellectual"
2880,I,"achievements, and we live among such philosophers and poets"
2881,I,as surpass beyond comparison any who have appeared since the last
2882,I,national struggle for civil and religious liberty. The most unfailing
2883,I,"herald, companion, and follower of the awakening of a great people"
2884,I,"to work a beneficial change in opinion or institution, is poetry."
2885,I,At such periods there is an accumulation of the power of communicating
2886,I,and receiving intense and impassioned conceptions respecting man
2887,I,"and nature. The persons in whom this power resides may often, as far"
2888,I,"as regards many portions of their nature, have little apparent"
2889,I,correspondence with that spirit of good of which they are
2890,I,"the ministers. But even whilst they deny and abjure, they are yet"
2891,I,"compelled to serve, the power which is seated on the throne of"
2892,I,their own soul. It is impossible to read the compositions of the
2893,I,most celebrated writers of the present day without being startled
2894,I,with the electric life which burns within their words. They measure
2895,I,the circumference and sound the depths of human nature with a
2896,I,"comprehensive and all-penetrating spirit, and they are themselves"
2897,I,perhaps the most sincerely astonished at its manifestations; for
2898,I,it is less their spirit than the spirit of the age. Poets are the
2899,I,hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration; the mirrors of the
2900,I,gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present; the words
2901,I,which express what they understand not; the trumpets which sing
2902,I,"to battle, and feel not what they inspire; the influence which is"
2903,I,"moved not, but moves.  Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of"
2904,I,the world.
