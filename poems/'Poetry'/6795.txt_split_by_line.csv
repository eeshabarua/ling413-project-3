246,THE GODS OF GREECE.,The wavelet's silver foam.
247,THE GODS OF GREECE.,
248,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"Yon bay, chaste Daphne wreathed,"
249,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"Yon stone was mournful Niobe's mute cell,"

303,THE GODS OF GREECE.,The shades renewed the pleasures life held dear:
304,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"The faithful spouse rejoined remembered love,"
305,THE GODS OF GREECE.,And rushed along the meads the charioteer;
306,THE GODS OF GREECE.,There Linus poured the old accustomed strain;

308,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"Friend there once more Orestes could regain,"
309,THE GODS OF GREECE.,His arrows--Philoctetes!
310,THE GODS OF GREECE.,
311,THE GODS OF GREECE.,More glorious than the meeds
312,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"That in their strife with labor nerved the brave,"
313,THE GODS OF GREECE.,To the great doer of renowned deeds
314,THE GODS OF GREECE.,The Hebe and the heaven the Thunderer gave.

318,THE GODS OF GREECE.,On the bark tempest-tossed!
319,THE GODS OF GREECE.,
320,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"Art thou, fair world, no more?"
321,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"Return, thou virgin-bloom on Nature's face;"
322,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"Ah, only on the minstrel's magic shore,"
323,THE GODS OF GREECE.,Can we the footstep of sweet fable trace!
324,THE GODS OF GREECE.,The meadows mourn for the old hallowing life;
325,THE GODS OF GREECE.,Vainly we search the earth of gods bereft;
326,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"Where once the warm and living shapes were rife,"
327,THE GODS OF GREECE.,Shadows alone are left!
328,THE GODS OF GREECE.,
329,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"Cold, from the north, has gone"
330,THE GODS OF GREECE.,Over the flowers the blast that killed their May;
331,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"And, to enrich the worship of the one,"
332,THE GODS OF GREECE.,A universe of gods must pass away!
333,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"Mourning, I search on yonder starry steeps,"
334,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"But thee no more, Selene, there I see!"
335,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"And through the woods I call, and o'er the deeps,"
336,THE GODS OF GREECE.,And--Echo answers me!
337,THE GODS OF GREECE.,
338,THE GODS OF GREECE.,Deaf to the joys she gives--
339,THE GODS OF GREECE.,Blind to the pomp of which she is possessed--

344,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"Her plodding round, and, by the leaden weights,"
345,THE GODS OF GREECE.,The slavish motion keeps.
346,THE GODS OF GREECE.,
347,THE GODS OF GREECE.,To-morrow to receive
348,THE GODS OF GREECE.,"New life, she digs her proper grave to-day;"
349,THE GODS OF GREECE.,And icy moons with weary sameness weave

394,RESIGNATION.,"Here,--say they,--terrors on the bad alight,"
395,RESIGNATION.,And joys to greet the virtuous spring.
396,RESIGNATION.,"The bosom's windings thou'lt expose to sight,"

626,THE ARTISTS.,Man's loftiest rank ye've ever had!
627,THE ARTISTS.,

630,THE ARTISTS.,"A boundless structure, in night's veil concealed,"
631,THE ARTISTS.,"Illumed by naught but faint and languid rays,"
632,THE ARTISTS.,"A band of phantoms, struggling ceaselessly,"
633,THE ARTISTS.,"Holding his mind in slavish fetters bound,"
634,THE ARTISTS.,"Unsociable and rude as be,"
635,THE ARTISTS.,"Assailing him on every side around,--"
636,THE ARTISTS.,Thus seemed to man creation in that day!
637,THE ARTISTS.,United to surrounding forms alone
638,THE ARTISTS.,"By the blind chains the passions had put on,"
639,THE ARTISTS.,Whilst Nature's beauteous spirit fled away
640,THE ARTISTS.,"Unfelt, untasted, and unknown."
641,THE ARTISTS.,
642,THE ARTISTS.,"And, as it hovered o'er with parting ray,"
643,THE ARTISTS.,"Ye seized the shades so neighborly,"
644,THE ARTISTS.,"With silent hand, with feeling mind,"
645,THE ARTISTS.,And taught how they might be combined
646,THE ARTISTS.,In one firm bond of harmony.
647,THE ARTISTS.,"The gaze, light-soaring, felt uplifted then,"
648,THE ARTISTS.,When first the cedar's slender trunk it viewed;
649,THE ARTISTS.,And pleasingly the ocean's crystal flood
650,THE ARTISTS.,Reflected back the dancing form again.
651,THE ARTISTS.,"Could ye mistake the look, with beauty fraught,"
652,THE ARTISTS.,That Nature gave to help ye on your way?
653,THE ARTISTS.,The image floating on the billows taught
654,THE ARTISTS.,The art the fleeting shadow to portray.
655,THE ARTISTS.,
656,THE ARTISTS.,"From her own being torn apart,"
657,THE ARTISTS.,"Her phantom, beauteous as a dream,"
658,THE ARTISTS.,"She plunged into the silvery stream,"
659,THE ARTISTS.,Surrendering to her spoiler's art.
660,THE ARTISTS.,Creative power soon in your breast unfolded;
661,THE ARTISTS.,"Too noble far, not idly to conceive,"
662,THE ARTISTS.,"The shadow's form in sand, in clay ye moulded,"
663,THE ARTISTS.,And made it in the sketch its being leave.
664,THE ARTISTS.,"The longing thirst for action then awoke,--"
665,THE ARTISTS.,And from your breast the first creation broke.
666,THE ARTISTS.,
667,THE ARTISTS.,"By contemplation captive made,"
668,THE ARTISTS.,"Ensnared by your discerning eye,"
669,THE ARTISTS.,The friendly phantom's soon betrayed
670,THE ARTISTS.,The talisman that roused your ecstasy.
671,THE ARTISTS.,"The laws of wonder-working might,"
672,THE ARTISTS.,"The stores by beauty brought to light,"
673,THE ARTISTS.,Inventive reason in soft union planned
674,THE ARTISTS.,To blend together 'neath your forming hand.
675,THE ARTISTS.,"The obelisk, the pyramid ascended,"
676,THE ARTISTS.,"The Hermes stood, the column sprang on high,"
677,THE ARTISTS.,"The reed poured forth the woodland melody,"
678,THE ARTISTS.,Immortal song on victor's deeds attended.
679,THE ARTISTS.,
680,THE ARTISTS.,"The fairest flowers that decked the earth,"
681,THE ARTISTS.,"Into a nosegay, with wise choice combined,"
682,THE ARTISTS.,Thus the first art from Nature had its birth;
683,THE ARTISTS.,"Into a garland then were nosegays twined,"
684,THE ARTISTS.,"And from the works that mortal hands had made,"
685,THE ARTISTS.,"A second, nobler art was now displayed."
686,THE ARTISTS.,"The child of beauty, self-sufficient now,"
687,THE ARTISTS.,"That issued from your hands to perfect day,"
688,THE ARTISTS.,"Loses the chaplet that adorned its brow,"
689,THE ARTISTS.,Soon as reality asserts its sway.
690,THE ARTISTS.,"The column, yielding to proportion's chains,"
691,THE ARTISTS.,"Must with its sisters join in friendly link,"
692,THE ARTISTS.,"The hero in the hero-band must sink,"
693,THE ARTISTS.,The Muses' harp peals forth its tuneful strains.
694,THE ARTISTS.,
695,THE ARTISTS.,The wondering savages soon came
696,THE ARTISTS.,To view the new creation's plan
697,THE ARTISTS.,"""Behold!""--the joyous crowds exclaim,--"
698,THE ARTISTS.,"""Behold, all this is done by man!"""
699,THE ARTISTS.,With jocund and more social aim
700,THE ARTISTS.,"The minstrel's lyre their awe awoke,"
701,THE ARTISTS.,"Telling of Titans, and of giant's frays"
702,THE ARTISTS.,"And lion-slayers, turning, as he spoke,"
703,THE ARTISTS.,Even into heroes those who heard his lays.
704,THE ARTISTS.,"For the first time the soul feels joy,"
705,THE ARTISTS.,"By raptures blessed that calmer are,"
706,THE ARTISTS.,"That only greet it from afar,"
707,THE ARTISTS.,"That passions wild can ne'er destroy,"
708,THE ARTISTS.,"And that, when tasted, do not cloy."
709,THE ARTISTS.,
710,THE ARTISTS.,"And now the spirit, free and fair,"
711,THE ARTISTS.,Awoke from out its sensual sleep;
712,THE ARTISTS.,"By you unchained, the slave of care"
713,THE ARTISTS.,Into the arms of joy could leap.
714,THE ARTISTS.,"Each brutish barrier soon was set at naught,"
715,THE ARTISTS.,"Humanity first graced the cloudless brow,"
716,THE ARTISTS.,"And the majestic, noble stranger, thought,"
717,THE ARTISTS.,From out the wondering brain sprang boldly now.
718,THE ARTISTS.,"Man in his glory stood upright,"
719,THE ARTISTS.,And showed the stars his kingly face;
720,THE ARTISTS.,His speaking glance the sun's bright light
721,THE ARTISTS.,Blessed in the realms sublime of space.
722,THE ARTISTS.,"Upon the cheek now bloomed the smile,"
723,THE ARTISTS.,The voice's soulful harmony
724,THE ARTISTS.,"Expanded into song the while,"
725,THE ARTISTS.,And feeling swam in the moist eye;
726,THE ARTISTS.,"And from the mouth, with spirit teeming o'er,"
727,THE ARTISTS.,"Jest, sweetly linked with grace, began to pour."
728,THE ARTISTS.,
729,THE ARTISTS.,"Sunk in the instincts of the worm,"
730,THE ARTISTS.,"By naught but sensual lust possessed,"
731,THE ARTISTS.,Ye recognized within his breast
732,THE ARTISTS.,Love-spiritual's noble germ;
733,THE ARTISTS.,And that this germ of love so blest
734,THE ARTISTS.,"Escaped the senses' abject load,"
735,THE ARTISTS.,To the first pastoral song he owed.
736,THE ARTISTS.,"Raised to the dignity of thought,"
737,THE ARTISTS.,Passions more calm to flow were taught
738,THE ARTISTS.,From the bard's mouth with melody.
739,THE ARTISTS.,The cheeks with dewy softness burned;
740,THE ARTISTS.,"The longing that, though quenched, still yearned,"
741,THE ARTISTS.,Proclaimed the spirit-harmony.
742,THE ARTISTS.,
743,THE ARTISTS.,"The wisest's wisdom, and the strongest's vigor,--"
744,THE ARTISTS.,"The meekest's meekness, and the noblest's grace,"
745,THE ARTISTS.,"By you were knit together in one figure,"
746,THE ARTISTS.,Wreathing a radiant glory round the place.
747,THE ARTISTS.,"Man at the Unknown's sight must tremble,"
748,THE ARTISTS.,Yet its refulgence needs must love;
749,THE ARTISTS.,"That mighty Being to resemble,"
750,THE ARTISTS.,Each glorious hero madly strove;
751,THE ARTISTS.,The prototype of beauty's earliest strain
752,THE ARTISTS.,Ye made resound through Nature's wide domain.
753,THE ARTISTS.,
754,THE ARTISTS.,"The passions' wild and headlong course,"
755,THE ARTISTS.,"The ever-varying plan of fate,"
756,THE ARTISTS.,"Duty and instinct's twofold force,"
757,THE ARTISTS.,With proving mind and guidance straight
758,THE ARTISTS.,Ye then conducted to their ends.
759,THE ARTISTS.,"What Nature, as she moves along,"
760,THE ARTISTS.,"Far from each other ever rends,"
761,THE ARTISTS.,"Become upon the stage, in song,"
762,THE ARTISTS.,"Members of order, firmly bound."
763,THE ARTISTS.,"Awed by the Furies' chorus dread,"
764,THE ARTISTS.,Murder draws down upon its head
765,THE ARTISTS.,The doom of death from their wild sound.
766,THE ARTISTS.,"Long e'er the wise to give a verdict dared,"
767,THE ARTISTS.,An Iliad had fate's mysteries declared
768,THE ARTISTS.,To early ages from afar;
769,THE ARTISTS.,While Providence in silence fared
770,THE ARTISTS.,Into the world from Thespis' car.
771,THE ARTISTS.,Yet into that world's current so sublime
772,THE ARTISTS.,"Your symmetry was borne before its time,"
773,THE ARTISTS.,When the dark hand of destiny
774,THE ARTISTS.,Failed in your sight to part by force.
775,THE ARTISTS.,
776,THE ARTISTS.,"What it had fashioned 'neath your eye,"
777,THE ARTISTS.,"In darkness life made haste to die,"
778,THE ARTISTS.,Ere it fulfilled its beauteous course.
779,THE ARTISTS.,Then ye with bold and self-sufficient might
780,THE ARTISTS.,Led the arch further through the future's night:
781,THE ARTISTS.,"Then, too, ye plunged, without a fear,"
782,THE ARTISTS.,"Into Avernus' ocean black,"
783,THE ARTISTS.,And found the vanished life so dear
784,THE ARTISTS.,"Beyond the urn, and brought it back."
785,THE ARTISTS.,"A blooming Pollux-form appeared now soon,"
786,THE ARTISTS.,"On Castor leaning, and enshrined in light--"
787,THE ARTISTS.,"The shadow that is seen upon the moon,"
788,THE ARTISTS.,Ere she has filled her silvery circle bright!
789,THE ARTISTS.,
790,THE ARTISTS.,"Yet higher,--higher still above the earth"
791,THE ARTISTS.,Inventive genius never ceased to rise:
792,THE ARTISTS.,"Creations from creations had their birth,"
793,THE ARTISTS.,And harmonies from harmonies.
794,THE ARTISTS.,"What here alone enchants the ravished sight,"
795,THE ARTISTS.,A nobler beauty yonder must obey;
796,THE ARTISTS.,"The graceful charms that in the nymph unite,"
797,THE ARTISTS.,In the divine Athene melt away;
798,THE ARTISTS.,"The strength with which the wrestler is endowed,"
799,THE ARTISTS.,In the god's beauty we no longer find:
800,THE ARTISTS.,The wonder of his time--Jove's image proud--
801,THE ARTISTS.,In the Olympian temple is enshrined.
802,THE ARTISTS.,
803,THE ARTISTS.,"The world, transformed by industry's bold hand,"
804,THE ARTISTS.,"The human heart, by new-born instincts moved,"
805,THE ARTISTS.,"That have in burning fights been fully proved,"
806,THE ARTISTS.,Your circle of creation now expand.
807,THE ARTISTS.,"Advancing man bears on his soaring pinions,"
808,THE ARTISTS.,"In gratitude, art with him in his flight,"
809,THE ARTISTS.,And out of Nature's now-enriched dominions
810,THE ARTISTS.,New worlds of beauty issue forth to light.
811,THE ARTISTS.,The barriers upon knowledge are o'erthrown;
812,THE ARTISTS.,"The spirit that, with pleasure soon matured,"
813,THE ARTISTS.,Has in your easy triumphs been inured
814,THE ARTISTS.,"To hasten through an artist-whole of graces,"
815,THE ARTISTS.,Nature's more distant columns duly places.
816,THE ARTISTS.,And overtakes her on her pathway lone.
817,THE ARTISTS.,"He weighs her now with weights that human are,"
818,THE ARTISTS.,Metes her with measures that she lent of old;
819,THE ARTISTS.,"While in her beauty's rites more practised far,"
820,THE ARTISTS.,She now must let his eye her form behold.
821,THE ARTISTS.,"With youthful and self-pleasing bliss,"
822,THE ARTISTS.,"He lends the spheres his harmony,"
823,THE ARTISTS.,"And, if he praise earth's edifice,"
824,THE ARTISTS.,'Tis for its wondrous symmetry.
825,THE ARTISTS.,
826,THE ARTISTS.,
827,THE ARTISTS.,"In all that now around him breathes,"
828,THE ARTISTS.,Proportion sweet is ever rife;
829,THE ARTISTS.,And beauty's golden girdle wreathes
830,THE ARTISTS.,With mildness round his path through life;
831,THE ARTISTS.,"Perfection blest, triumphantly,"
832,THE ARTISTS.,Before him in your works soars high;
833,THE ARTISTS.,"Wherever boisterous rapture swells,"
834,THE ARTISTS.,"Wherever silent sorrow flees,"
835,THE ARTISTS.,"Where pensive contemplation dwells,"
836,THE ARTISTS.,"Where he the tears of anguish sees,"
837,THE ARTISTS.,"Where thousand terrors on him glare,"
838,THE ARTISTS.,Harmonious streams are yet behind--
839,THE ARTISTS.,"He sees the Graces sporting there,"
840,THE ARTISTS.,With feeling silent and refined.
841,THE ARTISTS.,"Gentle as beauty's lines together linking,"
842,THE ARTISTS.,"As the appearances that round him play,"
843,THE ARTISTS.,"In tender outline in each other sinking,"
844,THE ARTISTS.,The soft breath of his life thus fleets away.
845,THE ARTISTS.,"His spirit melts in the harmonious sea,"
846,THE ARTISTS.,"That, rich in rapture, round his senses flows,"
847,THE ARTISTS.,And the dissolving thought all silently
848,THE ARTISTS.,To omnipresent Cytherea grows.
849,THE ARTISTS.,"Joining in lofty union with the Fates,"
850,THE ARTISTS.,"On Graces and on Muses calm relying,"
851,THE ARTISTS.,With freely-offered bosom he awaits
852,THE ARTISTS.,The shaft that soon against him will be flying
853,THE ARTISTS.,From the soft bow necessity creates.
854,THE ARTISTS.,
855,THE ARTISTS.,"Favorites beloved of blissful harmony,"
856,THE ARTISTS.,"Welcome attendants on life's dreary road,"
857,THE ARTISTS.,"The noblest and the dearest far that she,"
858,THE ARTISTS.,"Who gave us life, to bless that life bestowed!"
859,THE ARTISTS.,"That unyoked man his duties bears in mind,"
860,THE ARTISTS.,"And loves the fetters that his motions bind,"
861,THE ARTISTS.,"That Chance with brazen sceptre rules him not,--"
862,THE ARTISTS.,"For this eternity is now your lot,"
863,THE ARTISTS.,Your heart has won a bright reward for this.
864,THE ARTISTS.,"That round the cup where freedom flows,"
865,THE ARTISTS.,"Merrily sport the gods of bliss,--"
866,THE ARTISTS.,"The beauteous dream its fragrance throws,"
867,THE ARTISTS.,"For this, receive a loving kiss!"
868,THE ARTISTS.,
869,THE ARTISTS.,"The spirit, glorious and serene,"
870,THE ARTISTS.,"Who round necessity the graces trains,--"
871,THE ARTISTS.,Who bids his ether and his starry plains
872,THE ARTISTS.,"Upon us wait with pleasing mien,--"
873,THE ARTISTS.,"Who, 'mid his terrors, by his majesty gives joy,"
874,THE ARTISTS.,"And who is beauteous e'en when seeking to destroy,--"
875,THE ARTISTS.,"Him imitate, the artist good!"
876,THE ARTISTS.,As o'er the streamlet's crystal flood
877,THE ARTISTS.,"The banks with checkered dances hover,"
