68,INTRODUCTION.,INTRODUCTION.
69,INTRODUCTION.,
70,INTRODUCTION.,
71,INTRODUCTION.,Few poems have been more variously designated than _Comus_. Milton
72,INTRODUCTION.,"himself describes it simply as ""A Mask""; by others it has been"
73,INTRODUCTION.,"criticised and estimated as a lyrical drama, a drama in the epic style,"
74,INTRODUCTION.,"a lyric poem in the _form_ of a play, a phantasy, an allegory, a"
75,INTRODUCTION.,"philosophical poem, a suite of speeches or majestic soliloquies, and"
76,INTRODUCTION.,even a didactic poem. Such variety in the description of the poem is
77,INTRODUCTION.,"explained partly by its complex charm and many-sided interest, and"
78,INTRODUCTION.,partly by the desire to describe it from that point of view which should
79,INTRODUCTION.,best reconcile its literary form with what we know of the genius and
80,INTRODUCTION.,"powers of its author. Those who, like Dr. Johnson, have blamed it as a"
81,INTRODUCTION.,"drama, have admired it ""as a series of lines,"" or as a lyric; one"
82,INTRODUCTION.,"writer, who has found that its characters are nothing, its sentiments"
83,INTRODUCTION.,"tedious, its story uninteresting, has nevertheless ""doubted whether"
84,INTRODUCTION.,there will ever be any similar poem which gives so true a conception of
85,INTRODUCTION.,"the capacity and the dignity of the mind by which it was produced"""
86,INTRODUCTION.,(Bagehot's _Literary Studies_). Some who have praised it as an allegory
87,INTRODUCTION.,"see in it a satire on the evils both of the Church and of the State,"
88,INTRODUCTION.,while others regard it as alluding to the vices of the Court alone. Some
89,INTRODUCTION.,"have found its lyrical parts the best, while others, charmed with its"
90,INTRODUCTION.,"""divine philosophy,"" have commended those deep conceits which place it"
91,INTRODUCTION.,"alongside of the _Faerie Queen_, as shadowing forth an episode in the"
92,INTRODUCTION.,education of a noble soul and as a poet's lesson against intemperance
93,INTRODUCTION.,"and impurity. But no one can refuse to admit that, more than any other"
94,INTRODUCTION.,"of Milton's shorter poems, it gives us an insight into the peculiar"
95,INTRODUCTION.,"genius and character of its author: it was, in the opinion of Hallam,"
96,INTRODUCTION.,"""sufficient to convince any one of taste and feeling that a great poet"
97,INTRODUCTION.,"had arisen in England, and one partly formed in a different school from"
98,INTRODUCTION.,"his contemporaries."" It is true that in the early poems we do not find"
99,INTRODUCTION.,"the whole of Milton, for he had yet to pass through many years of"
100,INTRODUCTION.,"trouble and controversy; but _Comus_, in a special degree, reveals or"
101,INTRODUCTION.,foreshadows much of the Milton of _Paradise Lost_. Whether we regard its
102,INTRODUCTION.,"place in Milton's life, in the series of his works, or in English"
103,INTRODUCTION.,"literature as a whole, the poem is full of significance: it is worth"
104,INTRODUCTION.,"while, therefore, to consider how its form was determined by the"
105,INTRODUCTION.,external circumstances and previous training of the poet; by his
106,INTRODUCTION.,"favourite studies in poetry, philosophy, history, and music; and by his"
107,INTRODUCTION.,"noble theory of life in general, and of a poet's life in particular."
108,INTRODUCTION.,
109,INTRODUCTION.,"The mask was represented at Ludlow Castle on September 29th, 1634; it"
110,INTRODUCTION.,"was probably composed early in that year. It belongs, therefore, to that"
111,INTRODUCTION.,"group of poems (_L'Allegro_, _Il Penseroso_, _Arcades_, _Comus_, and"
112,INTRODUCTION.,_Lycidas_) written by Milton while living in his father's house at
113,INTRODUCTION.,"Horton, near Windsor, after having left the University of Cambridge in"
114,INTRODUCTION.,"July, 1632. As he was born in 1608, he would be twenty-five years of age"
115,INTRODUCTION.,"when this poem was composed. During his stay at Horton (1632-39), which"
116,INTRODUCTION.,"was broken only by a journey to Italy in 1638-9, he was chiefly occupied"
117,INTRODUCTION.,"with the study of the Greek, Roman, Italian, and English literatures,"
118,INTRODUCTION.,each of which has left its impress on _Comus_. He read widely and
119,INTRODUCTION.,"carefully, and it has been said that his great and original imagination"
120,INTRODUCTION.,"was almost entirely nourished, or at least stimulated, by books: his"
121,INTRODUCTION.,"residence at Horton was, accordingly, pre-eminently what he intended it"
122,INTRODUCTION.,"to be, and what his father wisely and gladly permitted it to be--a time"
123,INTRODUCTION.,of preparation and ripening for the work to which he had dedicated
124,INTRODUCTION.,himself. We are reminded of his own words in _Comus_:
125,INTRODUCTION.,
126,INTRODUCTION.,And Wisdom's self
127,INTRODUCTION.,"Oft seeks to sweet retired solitude,"
128,INTRODUCTION.,"Where, with her best nurse, Contemplation,"
129,INTRODUCTION.,"She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings,"
130,INTRODUCTION.,"That, in the various bustle of resort,"
131,INTRODUCTION.,"Were all to-ruffled, and sometimes impaired."
132,INTRODUCTION.,
133,INTRODUCTION.,We find in _Comus_ abundant reminiscences of Milton's study of the
134,INTRODUCTION.,"literature of antiquity. ""It would not be too much to say that the"
135,INTRODUCTION.,literature of antiquity was to Milton's genius what soil and light are
136,INTRODUCTION.,"to a plant. It nourished, it coloured, it developed it. It determined"
137,INTRODUCTION.,"not merely his character as an artist, but it exercised an influence on"
138,INTRODUCTION.,his intellect and temper scarcely less powerful than hereditary
139,INTRODUCTION.,instincts and contemporary history. It at once animated and chastened
140,INTRODUCTION.,his imagination; it modified his fancy; it furnished him with his
141,INTRODUCTION.,models. On it his taste was formed; on it his style was moulded. From it
142,INTRODUCTION.,his diction and his method derived their peculiarities. It transformed
143,INTRODUCTION.,what would in all probability have been the mere counterpart of
144,INTRODUCTION.,Caedmon's Paraphrase or Langland's Vision into Paradise Lost; and what
145,INTRODUCTION.,would have been the mere counterpart of Corydon's Doleful Knell and the
146,INTRODUCTION.,"satire of the Three Estates, into Lycidas and Comus."" (_Quarterly"
147,INTRODUCTION.,"Review_, No. 326.)"
148,INTRODUCTION.,
149,INTRODUCTION.,"But Milton has also told us that Spenser was his master, and the full"
150,INTRODUCTION.,charm of _Comus_ cannot be realised without reference to the artistic
151,INTRODUCTION.,and philosophical spirit of the author of the _Faerie Queene_. Both
152,INTRODUCTION.,poems deal with the war between the body and the soul--between the lower
153,INTRODUCTION.,"and the higher nature. In an essay on 'Spenser as a philosophic poet,'"
154,INTRODUCTION.,"De Vere says: ""The perils and degradations of an animalised life are"
155,INTRODUCTION.,shown under the allegory of Sir Guyon's sea voyage with its successive
156,INTRODUCTION.,"storms and whirlpools, its 'rock of Reproach' strewn with wrecks and"
157,INTRODUCTION.,"dead men's bones, its 'wandering islands,' its 'quicksands of"
158,INTRODUCTION.,"Unthriftihead,' its 'whirlepoole of Decay,' its 'sea-monsters,' and"
159,INTRODUCTION.,"lastly, its 'bower of Bliss,' and the doom which overtakes it, together"
160,INTRODUCTION.,"with the deliverance of Acrasia's victims, transformed by that witch's"
161,INTRODUCTION.,spells into beasts. Still more powerful is the allegory of worldly
162,INTRODUCTION.,"ambition, illustrated under the name of 'the cave of Mammon.' The Legend"
163,INTRODUCTION.,of Holiness delineates with not less insight those enemies which wage
164,INTRODUCTION.,"war upon the spiritual life."" All this Milton had studied in the _Faerie"
165,INTRODUCTION.,"Queene_, and had understood it; and, like Sir Guyon, he felt himself to"
166,INTRODUCTION.,be a knight enrolled under the banner of Parity and Self-Control. So
167,INTRODUCTION.,"that, in _Comus_, we find the sovereign value of Temperance or"
168,INTRODUCTION.,Self-Regulation--what the Greeks called +sôphrosynê+--set forth
169,INTRODUCTION.,no less clearly than in Spenser's poem: in Milton's mask it becomes
170,INTRODUCTION.,almost identical with Virtue itself. The enchantments of Acrasia in her
171,INTRODUCTION.,Bower of Bliss become the spells of Comus; the armour of Belphoebe
172,INTRODUCTION.,"becomes the ""complete steel"" of Chastity; while the supremacy of"
173,INTRODUCTION.,"Conscience, the bounty of Nature and man's ingratitude, the unloveliness"
174,INTRODUCTION.,"of Mammon and of Excess, the blossom of Courtesy oft found on lowly"
175,INTRODUCTION.,"stalk, and the final triumph of Virtue through striving and temptation,"
176,INTRODUCTION.,all are dwelt upon.
177,INTRODUCTION.,
178,INTRODUCTION.,"It is the mind that maketh good or ill,"
179,INTRODUCTION.,"That maketh wretch or happie, rich or poore:"
180,INTRODUCTION.,
181,INTRODUCTION.,so speaks Spenser; and Milton similarly--
182,INTRODUCTION.,
183,INTRODUCTION.,He that has light within his own clear breast
184,INTRODUCTION.,"May sit i' the centre, and enjoy bright day:"
185,INTRODUCTION.,But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts
186,INTRODUCTION.,Benighted walks under the mid-day sun;
187,INTRODUCTION.,Himself is his own dungeon.
188,INTRODUCTION.,
189,INTRODUCTION.,"In endeavouring still further to trace, by means of verbal or structural"
190,INTRODUCTION.,"resemblances, the sources from which Milton drew his materials for"
191,INTRODUCTION.,"_Comus_, critics have referred to Peele's _Old Wives' Tale_ (1595); to"
192,INTRODUCTION.,"Fletcher's pastoral, _The Faithful Shepherdess_, of which Charles Lamb"
193,INTRODUCTION.,has said that if all its parts 'had been in unison with its many
194,INTRODUCTION.,"innocent scenes and sweet lyric intermixtures, it had been a poem fit to"
195,INTRODUCTION.,"vie with _Comus_ or the _Arcadia_, to have been put into the hands of"
196,INTRODUCTION.,"boys and virgins, to have made matter for young dreams, like the loves"
197,INTRODUCTION.,of Hermia and Lysander'; to Ben Jonson's mask of _Pleasure reconciled to
198,INTRODUCTION.,"Virtue_ (1619), in which Comus is ""the god of cheer, or the Belly""; and"
199,INTRODUCTION.,"to the _Comus_ of Erycius Puteanus (Henri du Puy), Professor of"
200,INTRODUCTION.,Eloquence at Louvain. It is true that Fletcher's pastoral was being
201,INTRODUCTION.,"acted in London about the time Milton was writing his _Comus_, that the"
202,INTRODUCTION.,"poem by the Dutch Professor was republished at Oxford in 1634, and that"
203,INTRODUCTION.,resemblances are evident between Milton's poem and those named. But
204,INTRODUCTION.,"Professor Masson does well in warning us that ""infinitely too much has"
205,INTRODUCTION.,"been made of such coincidences. After all of them, even the most ideal"
206,INTRODUCTION.,"and poetical, the feeling in reading _Comus_ is that all here is"
207,INTRODUCTION.,"different, all peculiar."" Whatever Milton borrowed, he borrowed, as he"
208,INTRODUCTION.,"says himself, in order to better it."
209,INTRODUCTION.,
210,INTRODUCTION.,It is interesting to consider the mutual relations of the poems written
211,INTRODUCTION.,by Milton at Horton. Everything that Milton wrote is Miltonic; he had
212,INTRODUCTION.,"what has been called the power of transforming everything into himself,"
213,INTRODUCTION.,"and these poems are, accordingly, evidences of the development of"
214,INTRODUCTION.,Milton's opinions and of his secret purpose. It has been said that
215,INTRODUCTION.,"_L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_ are to be regarded as ""the pleadings, the"
216,INTRODUCTION.,"decision on which is in Comus""--_L'Allegro_ representing the Cavalier,"
217,INTRODUCTION.,and _Il Penseroso_ the Puritan element. This is true only in a limited
218,INTRODUCTION.,sense. It is true that the Puritan element in the Horton series of poems
219,INTRODUCTION.,becomes more patent as we pass from the two lyrics to the mask of
220,INTRODUCTION.,"_Comus_, and from _Comus_ to the elegy of _Lycidas_, just as, in the"
221,INTRODUCTION.,"corresponding periods of time, the evils connected with the reign of"
222,INTRODUCTION.,Charles I. and with Laud's crusade against Puritanism were becoming more
223,INTRODUCTION.,pronounced. But we can hardly regard Milton as having expressed any new
224,INTRODUCTION.,"decision in _Comus_: the decision is already made when ""vain deluding"
225,INTRODUCTION.,"Joys"" are banished in _Il Penseroso_, and ""loathed Melancholy"" in"
226,INTRODUCTION.,_L'Allegro_. The mask is an expansion and exaltation of the delights of
227,INTRODUCTION.,"the contemplative man, but there is still a place for the ""unreproved"
228,INTRODUCTION.,"pleasures"" of the cheerful man. Unless it were so, _Comus_ could not"
229,INTRODUCTION.,"have been written; there would have been no ""sunshine holiday"" for the"
230,INTRODUCTION.,"rustics and no ""victorious dance"" for the gentle lady and her brothers."
231,INTRODUCTION.,But in _Comus_ we realise the mutual relation of _L'Allegro_ and _Il
232,INTRODUCTION.,Penseroso_; we see their application to the joys and sorrows of the
233,INTRODUCTION.,actual life of individuals; we observe human nature in contact with the
234,INTRODUCTION.,"""hard assays"" of life. And, subsequently, in _Lycidas_ we are made to"
235,INTRODUCTION.,"realise that this human nature is Milton's own, and to understand how it"
236,INTRODUCTION.,"was that his Puritanism which, three years before, had permitted him to"
237,INTRODUCTION.,"write a cavalier mask, should, three years after, lead him from the"
238,INTRODUCTION.,fresh fields of poetry into the barren plains of controversial prose.
239,INTRODUCTION.,
240,INTRODUCTION.,The Mask was a favourite form of entertainment in England in Milton's
241,INTRODUCTION.,"youth, and had been so from the time of Henry VIII., in whose reign"
242,INTRODUCTION.,"elaborate masked shows, introduced from Italy, first became popular. But"
243,INTRODUCTION.,"they seem to have found their way into England, in a crude form, even"
244,INTRODUCTION.,earlier; and we read of court disguisings in the reign of Edward III. It
245,INTRODUCTION.,is usually said that the Mask derives its name from the fact that the
246,INTRODUCTION.,"actors wore masks, and in Hall's Chronicle we read that, in 1512, ""on"
247,INTRODUCTION.,"the day of Epiphany at night, the king, with eleven others, was"
248,INTRODUCTION.,"disguised after the manner of Italy, called a Mask, a thing not seen"
249,INTRODUCTION.,"before in England; they were appareled in garments long and broad,"
250,INTRODUCTION.,"wrought all with gold, with _visors_ and caps of gold."" The truth,"
251,INTRODUCTION.,"however, seems to be that the use of a visor was not essential in such"
252,INTRODUCTION.,"entertainments, which, from the first, were called 'masks,' the word"
253,INTRODUCTION.,"'masker' being used sometimes of the players, and sometimes of their"
254,INTRODUCTION.,"disguises. The word has come to us, through the French form _masque_,"
255,INTRODUCTION.,"cognate with Spanish _mascarada_, a masquerade or assembly of maskers,"
256,INTRODUCTION.,otherwise called a mummery. Up to the time of Henry VIII. these
257,INTRODUCTION.,"entertainments were of the nature of dumb-show or _tableaux vivants_,"
258,INTRODUCTION.,and delighted the spectators chiefly by the splendour of the costumes
259,INTRODUCTION.,"and machinery employed in their representation; but, afterwards, the"
260,INTRODUCTION.,"chief actors spoke their parts, singing and dancing were introduced, and"
261,INTRODUCTION.,the composition of masks for royal and other courtly patrons became an
262,INTRODUCTION.,occupation worthy of a poet. They were frequently combined with other
263,INTRODUCTION.,"forms of amusement, all of which were, in the case of the Court, placed"
264,INTRODUCTION.,"under the management of a Master of Revels, whose official title was"
265,INTRODUCTION.,"Magister Jocorum, Revellorum et _Mascorum_; in the first printed English"
266,INTRODUCTION.,"tragedy, _Gorboduc_ (1565), each act opens with what is called a"
267,INTRODUCTION.,dumb-show or mask. But the more elaborate form of the Mask soon grew to
268,INTRODUCTION.,"be an entertainment complete in itself, and the demand for such became"
269,INTRODUCTION.,so great in the time of James I. and Charles I. that the history of
270,INTRODUCTION.,these reigns might almost be traced in the succession of masks then
271,INTRODUCTION.,"written. Ben Jonson, who thoroughly established the Mask in English"
272,INTRODUCTION.,"literature, wrote many Court Masks, and made them a vehicle less for the"
273,INTRODUCTION.,display of 'painting and carpentry' than for the expression of the
274,INTRODUCTION.,intellectual and social life of his time. His masks are excelled only
275,INTRODUCTION.,"by _Comus_, and possess in a high degree that 'Doric delicacy' in their"
276,INTRODUCTION.,songs and odes which Sir Henry Wotton found so ravishing in Milton's
277,INTRODUCTION.,"mask. Jonson, in his lifetime, declared that, next himself, only"
278,INTRODUCTION.,Fletcher and Chapman could write a mask; and apart from the compositions
279,INTRODUCTION.,"of these writers and of William Browne (_Inner Temple Masque_), there"
280,INTRODUCTION.,are few specimens worthy to be named along with Jonson's until we come
281,INTRODUCTION.,"to Milton's _Arcades_. Other mask-writers were Middleton, Dekker,"
282,INTRODUCTION.,"Shirley, Carew, and Davenant; and it is interesting to note that in"
283,INTRODUCTION.,"Carew's _Coelum Brittanicum_ (1633-4), for which Lawes composed the"
284,INTRODUCTION.,"music, the two boys who afterwards acted in _Comus_ had juvenile parts."
285,INTRODUCTION.,It has been pointed out that the popularity of the Mask in Milton's
286,INTRODUCTION.,youth received a stimulus from the Puritan hatred of the theatre which
287,INTRODUCTION.,"found expression at that time, and drove non-Puritans to welcome the"
288,INTRODUCTION.,Mask as a protest against that spirit which saw nothing but evil in
289,INTRODUCTION.,"every form of dramatic entertainment. Milton, who enjoyed the"
290,INTRODUCTION.,"theatre--both ""Jonson's learned sock"" and what ""ennobled hath the"
291,INTRODUCTION.,"buskined stage""--was led, through his friendship with the musician"
292,INTRODUCTION.,"Lawes, to compose a mask to celebrate the entry of the Earl of"
293,INTRODUCTION.,"Bridgewater upon his office of ""Lord President of the Council in the"
294,INTRODUCTION.,"Principality of Wales and the Marches of the same."" He had already"
295,INTRODUCTION.,"written, also at the request of Lawes, a mask, or portion of a mask,"
296,INTRODUCTION.,"called _Arcades_, and the success of this may have stimulated him to"
297,INTRODUCTION.,"higher effort. The result was _Comus_, in which the Mask reached its"
298,INTRODUCTION.,"highest level, and after which it practically faded out of our"
299,INTRODUCTION.,literature.
300,INTRODUCTION.,
301,INTRODUCTION.,"Milton's two masks, _Arcades_ and _Comus_, were written for members of"
302,INTRODUCTION.,"the same noble family, the former in honour of the Countess Dowager of"
303,INTRODUCTION.,"Derby, and the latter in honour of John, first Earl of Bridgewater, who"
304,INTRODUCTION.,was both her stepson and son-in-law. This two-fold relation arose from
305,INTRODUCTION.,"the fact that the Earl was the son of Viscount Brackley, the Countess's"
306,INTRODUCTION.,"second husband, and had himself married Lady Frances Stanley, a daughter"
307,INTRODUCTION.,"of the Countess by her first husband, the fifth Earl of Derby. Amongst"
308,INTRODUCTION.,the children of the Earl of Bridgewater were three who took important
309,INTRODUCTION.,"parts in the representation of _Comus_--Alice, the youngest daughter,"
310,INTRODUCTION.,"then about fourteen years of age, who appeared as _The Lady_; John,"
311,INTRODUCTION.,"Viscount Brackley, who took the part of the _Elder Brother_, and Thomas"
312,INTRODUCTION.,"Egerton, who appeared as the _Second Brother_. We do not know who acted"
313,INTRODUCTION.,"the parts of _Comus_ and _Sabrina_, but the part of the _Attendant"
314,INTRODUCTION.,"Spirit_ was taken by Henry Lawes, ""gentleman of the Chapel Royal, and"
315,INTRODUCTION.,"one of His Majesty's private musicians."" The Earl's children were his"
316,INTRODUCTION.,"pupils, and the mask was naturally produced under his direction."
317,INTRODUCTION.,Milton's friendship with Lawes is shown by the sonnet which the poet
318,INTRODUCTION.,addressed to the musician:
319,INTRODUCTION.,
320,INTRODUCTION.,"Harry, whose tuneful and well measur'd song"
321,INTRODUCTION.,First taught our English music how to span
322,INTRODUCTION.,"Words with just note and accent, not to scan"
323,INTRODUCTION.,"With Midas' ears, committing short and long;"
324,INTRODUCTION.,"Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng,"
325,INTRODUCTION.,With praise enough for Envy to look wan;
326,INTRODUCTION.,"To after age thou shalt be writ the man,"
327,INTRODUCTION.,That with smooth air could'st humour best our tongue.
328,INTRODUCTION.,"Thou honour'st Verse, and Verse must lend her wing"
329,INTRODUCTION.,"To honour thee, the priest of Phoebus' quire,"
330,INTRODUCTION.,"That tun'st their happiest lines in hymn, or story."
331,INTRODUCTION.,Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher
332,INTRODUCTION.,"Than his Casella, who he woo'd to sing,"
333,INTRODUCTION.,Met in the milder shades of Purgatory.
334,INTRODUCTION.,
335,INTRODUCTION.,We must remember also that it was to Lawes that Milton's _Comus_ owed
336,INTRODUCTION.,"its first publication, and, as we see from the dedication prefixed to"
337,INTRODUCTION.,"the text, that he was justly proud of his share in its first"
338,INTRODUCTION.,representation.
339,INTRODUCTION.,
340,INTRODUCTION.,Such were the persons who appeared in Milton's mask; they are few in
341,INTRODUCTION.,"number, and the plan of the piece is correspondingly simple. There are"
342,INTRODUCTION.,three scenes which may be briefly characterised thus:
343,INTRODUCTION.,
344,INTRODUCTION.,I. The Tempter and the Tempted: lines 1-658.
345,INTRODUCTION.,_Scene_: A wild wood.
346,INTRODUCTION.,
347,INTRODUCTION.,II. The Temptation and the Rescue: lines 659-958.
348,INTRODUCTION.,_Scene_: The Palace of Comus.
349,INTRODUCTION.,
350,INTRODUCTION.,III. The Triumph: lines 959-1023.
351,INTRODUCTION.,_Scene_: The President's Castle.
352,INTRODUCTION.,
353,INTRODUCTION.,"In the first scene, after a kind of prologue (lines 1-92), the interest"
354,INTRODUCTION.,"rises as we are introduced first to Comus and his rout, then to the Lady"
355,INTRODUCTION.,"alone and ""night-foundered,"" and finally to Comus and the Lady in"
356,INTRODUCTION.,company. At the same time the nature of the Lady's trial and her
357,INTRODUCTION.,subsequent victory are foreshadowed in a conversation between the
358,INTRODUCTION.,brothers and the attendant Spirit. This is one of the more Miltonic
359,INTRODUCTION.,"parts of the mask: in the philosophical reasoning of the elder brother,"
360,INTRODUCTION.,"as opposed to the matter-of-fact arguments of the younger, we trace the"
361,INTRODUCTION.,"young poet fresh from the study of the divine volume of Plato, and"
362,INTRODUCTION.,filled with a noble trust in God. In the second scene we breathe the
363,INTRODUCTION.,"unhallowed air of the abode of the wily tempter, who endeavours, ""under"
364,INTRODUCTION.,"fair pretence of friendly ends,"" to wind himself into the pure heart of"
365,INTRODUCTION.,"the Lady. But his ""gay rhetoric"" is futile against the ""sun-clad power"
366,INTRODUCTION.,"of chastity""; and he is driven off the scene by the two brothers, who"
367,INTRODUCTION.,are led and instructed by the Spirit disguised as the shepherd Thyrsis.
368,INTRODUCTION.,"But the Lady, having been lured into the haunt of impurity, is left"
369,INTRODUCTION.,"spell-bound, and appeal is made to the pure nymph Sabrina, who is ""swift"
370,INTRODUCTION.,"to aid a virgin, such as was herself, in hard-besetting need."" It is in"
371,INTRODUCTION.,the contention between Comus and the Lady in this scene that the
372,INTRODUCTION.,"interest of the mask may be said to culminate, for here its purpose"
373,INTRODUCTION.,"stands revealed: ""it is a song to Temperance as the ground of Freedom,"
374,INTRODUCTION.,"to temperance as the guard of all the virtues, to beauty as secured by"
375,INTRODUCTION.,"temperance, and its central point and climax is in the pleading of these"
376,INTRODUCTION.,motives by the Lady against their opposites in the mouth of the Lord of
377,INTRODUCTION.,"sensual Revel."" _Milton: Classical Writers_. In the third scene the Lady"
378,INTRODUCTION.,Alice and her brothers are presented by the Spirit to their noble father
379,INTRODUCTION.,"and mother as triumphing ""in victorious dance o'er sensual folly and"
380,INTRODUCTION.,"intemperance."" The Spirit then speaks the epilogue, calling upon mortals"
381,INTRODUCTION.,who love true freedom to strive after virtue:
382,INTRODUCTION.,
383,INTRODUCTION.,Love Virtue; she alone is free.
384,INTRODUCTION.,She can teach ye how to climb
385,INTRODUCTION.,Higher than the sphery chime;
386,INTRODUCTION.,"Or, if Virtue feeble were,"
387,INTRODUCTION.,Heaven itself would stoop to her.
388,INTRODUCTION.,
389,INTRODUCTION.,"The last couplet Milton afterwards, on his Italian journey, entered in"
390,INTRODUCTION.,"an album belonging to an Italian named Cerdogni, and underneath it the"
391,INTRODUCTION.,"words, _Coelum non animum muto dum trans mare curro_, and his"
392,INTRODUCTION.,"signature, Joannes Miltonius, Anglus. The juxtaposition of these verses"
393,INTRODUCTION.,is significant: though he had left his own land Milton had not become
394,INTRODUCTION.,"what, fifty or sixty years before, Roger Ascham had condemned as an"
395,INTRODUCTION.,"""Italianated Englishman."" He was one of those ""worthy Gentlemen of"
396,INTRODUCTION.,"England, whom all the Siren tongues of Italy could never untwine from"
397,INTRODUCTION.,the mast of God's word; nor no enchantment of vanity overturn them from
398,INTRODUCTION.,"the fear of God and love of honesty"" (Ascham's _Scholemaster_). And one"
399,INTRODUCTION.,"might almost infer that Milton, in his account of the sovereign plant"
400,INTRODUCTION.,"Haemony which was to foil the wiles of _Comus_, had remembered not only"
401,INTRODUCTION.,"Homer's description of the root Moly ""that Hermes once to wise Ulysses"
402,INTRODUCTION.,"gave,""{16:A} but also Ascham's remarks thereupon: ""The true medicine"
403,INTRODUCTION.,"against the enchantments of Circe, the vanity of licentious pleasure,"
404,INTRODUCTION.,"the enticements of all sin, is, in Homer, the herb Moly, with the black"
405,INTRODUCTION.,"root and white flower, sour at first, but sweet in the end; which Hesiod"
406,INTRODUCTION.,"termeth the study of Virtue, hard and irksome in the beginning, but in"
407,INTRODUCTION.,"the end easy and pleasant. And that which is most to be marvelled at,"
408,INTRODUCTION.,the divine poet Homer saith plainly that this medicine against sin and
409,INTRODUCTION.,"vanity is not found out by man, but given and taught by God."" Milton's"
410,INTRODUCTION.,"_Comus_, like his last great poems, is a poetical expression of the same"
411,INTRODUCTION.,"belief. ""His poetical works, the outcome of his inner life, his life of"
412,INTRODUCTION.,"artistic contemplation, are,"" in the words of Prof. Dowden, ""various"
413,INTRODUCTION.,renderings of one dominant idea--that the struggle for mastery between
414,INTRODUCTION.,good and evil is the prime fact of life; and that a final victory of the
415,INTRODUCTION.,righteous cause is assured by the existence of a divine order of the
416,INTRODUCTION.,"universe, which Milton knew by the name of 'Providence.'"""

757,COMUS.,"From her cabined loop-hole peep,                                 140"
758,COMUS.,And to the tell-tale Sun descry
759,COMUS.,Our concealed solemnity.
760,COMUS.,"Come, knit hands, and beat the ground"
761,COMUS.,In a light fantastic round.           [_The Measure._
762,COMUS.,"Break off, break off! I feel the different pace"
763,COMUS.,Of some chaste footing near about this ground.
764,COMUS.,Run to your shrouds within these brakes and trees;
765,COMUS.,Our number may affright. Some virgin sure
766,COMUS.,(For so I can distinguish by mine art)
767,COMUS.,"Benighted in these woods! Now to my charms,                      150"
768,COMUS.,And to my wily trains: I shall ere long
769,COMUS.,Be well stocked with as fair a herd as grazed
770,COMUS.,About my mother Circe. Thus I hurl
771,COMUS.,"My dazzling spells into the spongy air,"
772,COMUS.,"Of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion,"
773,COMUS.,"And give it false presentments, lest the place"
774,COMUS.,"And my quaint habits breed astonishment,"
775,COMUS.,And put the damsel to suspicious flight;
776,COMUS.,"Which must not be, for that's against my course."
777,COMUS.,"I, under fair pretence of friendly ends,                         160"
778,COMUS.,"And well-placed words of glozing courtesy,"
779,COMUS.,"Baited with reasons not unplausible,"
780,COMUS.,"Wind me into the easy-hearted man,"
781,COMUS.,And hug him into snares. When once her eye
782,COMUS.,"Hath met the virtue of this magic dust,"
783,COMUS.,I shall appear some harmless villager
784,COMUS.,Whom thrift keeps up about his country gear.
785,COMUS.,"But here she comes; I fairly step aside,"
786,COMUS.,"And hearken, if I may, her business here."
787,COMUS.,
788,COMUS.,_The LADY enters._
789,COMUS.,
790,COMUS.,"_Lady._ This way the noise was, if mine ear be true,"
791,COMUS.,My best guide now. Methought it was the sound
792,COMUS.,"Of riot and ill-managed merriment,                               172"
793,COMUS.,Such as the jocund flute or gamesome pipe
794,COMUS.,"Stirs up among the loose unlettered hinds,"
795,COMUS.,"When, for their teeming flocks and granges full,"
796,COMUS.,"In wanton dance they praise the bounteous Pan,"
797,COMUS.,And thank the gods amiss. I should be loth
798,COMUS.,To meet the rudeness and swilled insolence
799,COMUS.,"Of such late wassailers; yet, oh! where else"
800,COMUS.,Shall I inform my unacquainted feet                              180
801,COMUS.,In the blind mazes of this tangled wood?
802,COMUS.,"My brothers, when they saw me wearied out"
803,COMUS.,"With this long way, resolving here to lodge"
804,COMUS.,"Under the spreading favour of these pines,"
805,COMUS.,"Stepped, as they said, to the next thicket-side"
806,COMUS.,"To bring me berries, or such cooling fruit"
807,COMUS.,As the kind hospitable woods provide.
808,COMUS.,"They left me then when the grey-hooded Even,"
809,COMUS.,"Like a sad votarist in palmer's weed,"
810,COMUS.,Rose from the hindmost wheels of Phoebus' wain.                  190
811,COMUS.,"But where they are, and why they came not back,"
812,COMUS.,Is now the labour of my thoughts. 'Tis likeliest
813,COMUS.,They had engaged their wandering steps too far;
814,COMUS.,"And envious darkness, ere they could return,"
815,COMUS.,"Had stole them from me. Else, O thievish Night,"
816,COMUS.,"Why shouldst thou, but for some felonious end,"
817,COMUS.,In thy dark lantern thus close up the stars
818,COMUS.,"That Nature hung in heaven, and filled their lamps"
819,COMUS.,With everlasting oil to give due light
820,COMUS.,To the misled and lonely traveller?                              200
821,COMUS.,"This is the place, as well as I may guess,"
822,COMUS.,Whence even now the tumult of loud mirth
823,COMUS.,"Was rife, and perfect in my listening ear;"
824,COMUS.,Yet nought but single darkness do I find.
825,COMUS.,What might this be? A thousand fantasies
826,COMUS.,"Begin to throng into my memory,"
827,COMUS.,"Of calling shapes, and beckoning shadows dire,"
828,COMUS.,And airy tongues that syllable men's names
829,COMUS.,On sands and shores and desert wildernesses.
830,COMUS.,"These thoughts may startle well, but not astound                 210"
831,COMUS.,"The virtuous mind, that ever walks attended"
832,COMUS.,"By a strong siding champion, Conscience."
833,COMUS.,"O, welcome, pure-eyed Faith, white-handed Hope,"
834,COMUS.,"Thou hovering angel girt with golden wings,"
835,COMUS.,And thou unblemished form of Chastity!
836,COMUS.,"I see ye visibly, and now believe"
837,COMUS.,"That He, the Supreme Good, to whom all things ill"
838,COMUS.,"Are but as slavish officers of vengeance,"
839,COMUS.,"Would send a glistering guardian, if need were,"
840,COMUS.,To keep my life and honour unassailed....                        220
841,COMUS.,"Was I deceived, or did a sable cloud"
842,COMUS.,Turn forth her silver lining on the night?
843,COMUS.,I did not err: there does a sable cloud
844,COMUS.,"Turn forth her silver lining on the night,"
845,COMUS.,And casts a gleam over this tufted grove.
846,COMUS.,"I cannot hallo to my brothers, but"
847,COMUS.,Such noise as I can make to be heard farthest
848,COMUS.,I'll venture; for my new-enlivened spirits
849,COMUS.,"Prompt me, and they perhaps are not far off."
850,COMUS.,
851,COMUS.,_Song._
852,COMUS.,
853,COMUS.,"Sweet Echo, sweetest nymph, that liv'st unseen                   230"
854,COMUS.,Within thy airy shell
855,COMUS.,"By slow Meander's margent green,"
856,COMUS.,And in the violet-embroidered vale
857,COMUS.,Where the love-lorn nightingale
858,COMUS.,Nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well:
859,COMUS.,Canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair
860,COMUS.,That likest thy Narcissus are?
861,COMUS.,"O, if thou have"
862,COMUS.,"Hid them in some flowery cave,"
863,COMUS.,"Tell me but where,                                         240"
864,COMUS.,"Sweet Queen of Parley, Daughter of the Sphere!"
865,COMUS.,"So may'st thou be translated to the skies,"
866,COMUS.,And give resounding grace to all Heaven's harmonies!
867,COMUS.,
868,COMUS.,_Comus._ Can any mortal mixture of earth's mould
869,COMUS.,Breathe such divine enchanting ravishment?
870,COMUS.,"Sure something holy lodges in that breast,"
871,COMUS.,And with these raptures moves the vocal air
872,COMUS.,To testify his hidden residence.
873,COMUS.,How sweetly did they float upon the wings
874,COMUS.,"Of silence, through the empty-vaulted night,                     250"
875,COMUS.,At every fall smoothing the raven down
876,COMUS.,Of darkness till it smiled! I have oft heard
877,COMUS.,"My mother Circe with the Sirens three,"
878,COMUS.,"Amidst the flowery-kirtled Naiades,"
879,COMUS.,"Culling their potent herbs and baleful drugs,"
880,COMUS.,"Who, as they sung, would take the prisoned soul,"
881,COMUS.,"And lap it in Elysium: Scylla wept,"
882,COMUS.,"And chid her barking waves into attention,"
883,COMUS.,And fell Charybdis murmured soft applause.
884,COMUS.,"Yet they in pleasing slumber lulled the sense,                   260"
885,COMUS.,And in sweet madness robbed it of itself;
886,COMUS.,"But such a sacred and home-felt delight,"
887,COMUS.,"Such sober certainty of waking bliss,"
888,COMUS.,"I never heard till now. I'll speak to her,"
889,COMUS.,"And she shall be my queen.--Hail, foreign wonder!"
890,COMUS.,"Whom certain these rough shades did never breed,"
891,COMUS.,Unless the goddess that in rural shrine
892,COMUS.,Dwell'st here with Pan or Sylvan by blest song
893,COMUS.,Forbidding every bleak unkindly fog
894,COMUS.,To touch the prosperous growth of this tall wood.                270
895,COMUS.,
896,COMUS.,"_Lady._ Nay, gentle shepherd, ill is lost that praise"
897,COMUS.,That is addressed to unattending ears.
898,COMUS.,"Not any boast of skill, but extreme shift"
899,COMUS.,"How to regain my severed company,"
900,COMUS.,Compelled me to awake the courteous Echo
901,COMUS.,To give me answer from her mossy couch.
902,COMUS.,
903,COMUS.,"_Comus._ What chance, good Lady, hath bereft you thus?"
904,COMUS.,
905,COMUS.,_Lady._ Dim darkness and this leafy labyrinth.
906,COMUS.,
907,COMUS.,_Comus._ Could that divide you from near-ushering guides?
908,COMUS.,
909,COMUS.,_Lady._ They left me weary on a grassy turf.                     280
910,COMUS.,
911,COMUS.,"_Comus._ By falsehood, or discourtesy, or why?"
912,COMUS.,
913,COMUS.,_Lady._ To seek i' the valley some cool friendly spring.
914,COMUS.,
915,COMUS.,"_Comus._ And left your fair side all unguarded, lady?"
916,COMUS.,
917,COMUS.,"_Lady._ They were but twain, and purposed quick return."
918,COMUS.,
919,COMUS.,_Comus._ Perhaps forestalling night prevented them.
920,COMUS.,
921,COMUS.,_Lady._ How easy my misfortune is to hit!
922,COMUS.,
923,COMUS.,"_Comus._ Imports their loss, beside the present need?"
924,COMUS.,
925,COMUS.,_Lady._ No less than if I should my brothers lose.
926,COMUS.,
927,COMUS.,"_Comus._ Were they of manly prime, or youthful bloom?"
928,COMUS.,
929,COMUS.,_Lady._ As smooth as Hebe's their unrazored lips.                290
930,COMUS.,
931,COMUS.,"_Comus._ Two such I saw, what time the laboured ox"
932,COMUS.,"In his loose traces from the furrow came,"
933,COMUS.,And the swinked hedger at his supper sat.
934,COMUS.,"I saw them under a green mantling vine,"
935,COMUS.,"That crawls along the side of yon small hill,"
936,COMUS.,Plucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots;
937,COMUS.,"Their port was more than human, as they stood"
938,COMUS.,I took it for a faery vision
939,COMUS.,"Of some gay creatures of the element,"
940,COMUS.,"That in the colours of the rainbow live,                         300"
941,COMUS.,"And play i' the plighted clouds. I was awe-strook,"
942,COMUS.,"And, as I passed, I worshiped. If those you seek,"
943,COMUS.,It were a journey like the path to Heaven
944,COMUS.,To help you find them.
945,COMUS.,
946,COMUS.,"_Lady._                Gentle villager,"
947,COMUS.,What readiest way would bring me to that place?
948,COMUS.,
949,COMUS.,_Comus._ Due west it rises from this shrubby point.
950,COMUS.,
951,COMUS.,"_Lady._ To find out that, good shepherd, I suppose,"
952,COMUS.,"In such a scant allowance of star-light,"
953,COMUS.,"Would overtask the best land-pilot's art,"
954,COMUS.,Without the sure guess of well-practised feet.                   310
955,COMUS.,
956,COMUS.,"_Comus._ I know each lane, and every alley green,"
957,COMUS.,"Dingle, or bushy dell, of this wild wood,"
958,COMUS.,"And every bosky bourn from side to side,"
959,COMUS.,My daily walks and ancient neighbourhood;
960,COMUS.,"And, if your stray attendance be yet lodged,"
961,COMUS.,"Or shroud within these limits, I shall know"
962,COMUS.,"Ere morrow wake, or the low-roosted lark"
963,COMUS.,"From her thatched pallet rouse. If otherwise,"
964,COMUS.,"I can conduct you, lady, to a low"
965,COMUS.,"But loyal cottage, where you may be safe                         320"
966,COMUS.,Till further quest.
967,COMUS.,
968,COMUS.,"_Lady._              Shepherd, I take thy word,"
969,COMUS.,"And trust thy honest-offered courtesy,"
970,COMUS.,"Which oft is sooner found in lowly sheds,"
971,COMUS.,"With smoky rafters, than in tapestry halls"
972,COMUS.,"And courts of princes, where it first was named,"
973,COMUS.,And yet is most pretended. In a place
974,COMUS.,"Less warranted than this, or less secure,"
975,COMUS.,"I cannot be, that I should fear to change it."
976,COMUS.,"Eye me, blest Providence, and square my trial"
977,COMUS.,"To my proportioned strength! Shepherd, lead on."
978,COMUS.,
979,COMUS.,[_Exeunt._
980,COMUS.,
981,COMUS.,_Enter the TWO BROTHERS._
982,COMUS.,
983,COMUS.,"_Elder Brother._ Unmuffle, ye faint stars; and thou, fair moon,  331"
984,COMUS.,"That wont'st to love the traveller's benison,"
985,COMUS.,"Stoop thy pale visage through an amber cloud,"
986,COMUS.,"And disinherit Chaos, that reigns here"
987,COMUS.,In double night of darkness and of shades;
988,COMUS.,"Or, if your influence be quite dammed up"
989,COMUS.,"With black usurping mists, some gentle taper,"
990,COMUS.,Though a rush-candle from the wicker hole
991,COMUS.,"Of some clay habitation, visit us"
992,COMUS.,"With thy long levelled rule of streaming light,                  340"
993,COMUS.,"And thou shalt be our star of Arcady,"
994,COMUS.,Or Tyrian Cynosure.
995,COMUS.,
996,COMUS.,"_Second Brother._       Or, if our eyes"
997,COMUS.,"Be barred that happiness, might we but hear"
998,COMUS.,"The folded flocks, penned in their wattled cotes,"
999,COMUS.,"Or sound of pastoral reed with oaten stops,"
1000,COMUS.,"Or whistle from the lodge, or village cock"
1001,COMUS.,"Count the night-watches to his feathery dames,"
1002,COMUS.,"'Twould be some solace yet, some little cheering,"
1003,COMUS.,In this close dungeon of innumerous boughs.
1004,COMUS.,"But, Oh, that hapless virgin, our lost sister!                   350"
1005,COMUS.,"Where may she wander now, whither betake her"
1006,COMUS.,"From the chill dew, amongst rude burs and thistles?"
1007,COMUS.,"Perhaps some cold bank is her bolster now,"
1008,COMUS.,Or 'gainst the rugged bark of some broad elm
1009,COMUS.,"Leans her unpillowed head, fraught with sad fears."
1010,COMUS.,"What if in wild amazement and affright,"
1011,COMUS.,"Or, while we speak, within the direful grasp"
1012,COMUS.,"Of savage hunger, or of savage heat!"
1013,COMUS.,
1014,COMUS.,"_Elder Brother._ Peace, brother: be not over-exquisite"
1015,COMUS.,To cast the fashion of uncertain evils;                          360
1016,COMUS.,"For, grant they be so, while they rest unknown,"
1017,COMUS.,"What need a man forestall his date of grief,"
1018,COMUS.,And run to meet what he would most avoid?
1019,COMUS.,"Or, if they be but false alarms of fear,"
1020,COMUS.,How bitter is such self-delusion!
1021,COMUS.,"I do not think my sister so to seek,"
1022,COMUS.,"Or so unprincipled in virtue's book,"
1023,COMUS.,"And the sweet peace that goodness bosoms ever,"
1024,COMUS.,As that the single want of light and noise
1025,COMUS.,"(Not being in danger, as I trust she is not)                     370"
1026,COMUS.,"Could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts,"
1027,COMUS.,And put them into misbecoming plight.
1028,COMUS.,Virtue could see to do what Virtue would
1029,COMUS.,"By her own radiant light, though sun and moon"
1030,COMUS.,Were in the flat sea sunk. And Wisdom's self
1031,COMUS.,"Oft seeks to sweet retired solitude,"
1032,COMUS.,"Where, with her best nurse, Contemplation,"
1033,COMUS.,"She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings,"
1034,COMUS.,"That, in the various bustle of resort,"
1035,COMUS.,"Were all to-ruffled, and sometimes impaired.                     380"
1036,COMUS.,He that has light within his own clear breast
1037,COMUS.,"May sit i' the centre, and enjoy bright day:"
1038,COMUS.,But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts
1039,COMUS.,Benighted walks under the mid-day sun;
1040,COMUS.,Himself is his own dungeon.
1041,COMUS.,
1042,COMUS.,_Second Brother._            'Tis most true
1043,COMUS.,That musing meditation most affects
1044,COMUS.,"The pensive secrecy of desert cell,"
1045,COMUS.,"Far from the cheerful haunt of men and herds,"
1046,COMUS.,And sits as safe as in a senate-house;
1047,COMUS.,"For who would rob a hermit of his weeds,                         390"
1048,COMUS.,"His few books, or his beads, or maple dish,"
1049,COMUS.,Or do his grey hairs any violence?
1050,COMUS.,"But Beauty, like the fair Hesperian tree"
1051,COMUS.,"Laden with blooming gold, had need the guard"
1052,COMUS.,Of dragon-watch with unenchanted eye
1053,COMUS.,"To save her blossoms, and defend her fruit,"
1054,COMUS.,From the rash hand of bold Incontinence.
1055,COMUS.,You may as well spread out the unsunned heaps
1056,COMUS.,"Of miser's treasure by an outlaw's den,"
1057,COMUS.,"And tell me it is safe, as bid me hope                           400"
1058,COMUS.,"Danger will wink on Opportunity,"
1059,COMUS.,And let a single helpless maiden pass
1060,COMUS.,Uninjured in this wild surrounding waste.
1061,COMUS.,Of night or loneliness it recks me not;
1062,COMUS.,"I fear the dread events that dog them both,"
1063,COMUS.,Lest some ill-greeting touch attempt the person
1064,COMUS.,Of our unownéd sister.
1065,COMUS.,
1066,COMUS.,"_Elder Brother._           I do not, brother,"
1067,COMUS.,Infer as if I thought my sister's state
1068,COMUS.,Secure without all doubt or controversy;
1069,COMUS.,"Yet, where an equal poise of hope and fear                       410"
1070,COMUS.,"Does arbitrate the event, my nature is"
1071,COMUS.,"That I incline to hope rather than fear,"
1072,COMUS.,And gladly banish squint suspicion.
1073,COMUS.,My sister is not so defenceless left
1074,COMUS.,"As you imagine; she has a hidden strength,"
1075,COMUS.,Which you remember not.
1076,COMUS.,
1077,COMUS.,"_Second Brother._        What hidden strength,"
1078,COMUS.,"Unless the strength of Heaven, if you mean that?"
1079,COMUS.,
1080,COMUS.,"_Elder Brother._ I mean that too, but yet a hidden strength,"
1081,COMUS.,"Which, if Heaven gave it, may be termed her own."
1082,COMUS.,"'Tis chastity, my brother, chastity:                             420"
1083,COMUS.,"She that has that is clad in cómplete steel,"
1084,COMUS.,"And, like a quivered nymph with arrows keen,"
1085,COMUS.,"May trace huge forests, and unharboured heaths,"
1086,COMUS.,"Infámous hills, and sandy perilous wilds;"
1087,COMUS.,"Where, through the sacred rays of chastity,"
1088,COMUS.,"No savage fierce, bandite, or mountaineer,"
1089,COMUS.,Will dare to soil her virgin purity.
1090,COMUS.,"Yea, there where very desolation dwells,"
1091,COMUS.,"By grots and caverns shagged with horrid shades,"
1092,COMUS.,"She may pass on with unblenched majesty,                         430"
1093,COMUS.,"Be it not done in pride, or in presumption."
1094,COMUS.,"Some say no evil thing that walks by night,"
1095,COMUS.,"In fog or fire, by lake or moorish fen,"
1096,COMUS.,"Blue meagre hag, or stubborn unlaid ghost,"
1097,COMUS.,"That breaks his magic chains at curfew time,"
1098,COMUS.,"No goblin or swart faery of the mine,"
1099,COMUS.,Hath hurtful power o'er true virginity.
1100,COMUS.,"Do ye believe me yet, or shall I call"
1101,COMUS.,Antiquity from the old schools of Greece
1102,COMUS.,To testify the arms of chastity?                                 440
1103,COMUS.,Hence had the huntress Dian her dread bow
1104,COMUS.,"Fair silver-shafted queen for ever chaste,"
1105,COMUS.,Wherewith she tamed the brinded lioness
1106,COMUS.,"And spotted mountain-pard, but set at nought"
1107,COMUS.,The frivolous bolt of Cupid; gods and men
1108,COMUS.,"Feared her stern frown, and she was queen o' the woods."
1109,COMUS.,What was that snaky-headed Gorgon shield
1110,COMUS.,"That wise Minerva wore, unconquered virgin,"
1111,COMUS.,"Wherewith she freezed her foes to congealed stone,"
1112,COMUS.,"But rigid looks of chaste austerity,                             450"
1113,COMUS.,And noble grace that dashed brute violence
1114,COMUS.,With sudden adoration and blank awe?
1115,COMUS.,So dear to Heaven is saintly chastity
1116,COMUS.,"That, when a soul is found sincerely so,"
1117,COMUS.,"A thousand liveried angels lackey her,"
1118,COMUS.,"Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt,"
1119,COMUS.,And in clear dream and solemn vision
1120,COMUS.,Tell her of things that no gross ear can hear;
1121,COMUS.,Till oft converse with heavenly habitants
1122,COMUS.,"Begin to cast a beam on the outward shape,                       460"
1123,COMUS.,"The unpolluted temple of the mind,"
1124,COMUS.,"And turns it by degrees to the soul's essence,"
1125,COMUS.,"Till all be made immortal. But, when lust,"
1126,COMUS.,"By unchaste looks, loose gestures, and foul talk,"
1127,COMUS.,"But most by lewd and lavish act of sin,"
1128,COMUS.,"Lets in defilement to the inward parts,"
1129,COMUS.,"The soul grows clotted by contagion,"
1130,COMUS.,"Imbodies, and imbrutes, till she quite loose"
1131,COMUS.,The divine property of her first being.
1132,COMUS.,Such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp                     470
1133,COMUS.,"Oft seen in charnel-vaults and sepulchres,"
1134,COMUS.,"Lingering and sitting by a new-made grave,"
1135,COMUS.,"As loth to leave the body that it loved,"
1136,COMUS.,And linked itself by carnal sensualty
1137,COMUS.,To a degenerate and degraded state.
1138,COMUS.,
1139,COMUS.,_Second Brother._ How charming is divine Philosophy!
1140,COMUS.,"Not harsh and crabbed, as dull fools suppose,"
1141,COMUS.,"But musical as is Apollo's lute,"
1142,COMUS.,"And a perpetual feast of nectared sweets,"
1143,COMUS.,Where no crude surfeit reigns.
1144,COMUS.,
1145,COMUS.,_Elder Brother._               List! list! I hear                480
1146,COMUS.,Some far-off hallo break the silent air.
1147,COMUS.,
1148,COMUS.,_Second Brother._ Methought so too; what should it be?
1149,COMUS.,
1150,COMUS.,"_Elder Brother._                                       For certain,"
1151,COMUS.,"Either some one, like us, night-foundered here,"
1152,COMUS.,"Or else some neighbour woodman, or, at worst,"
1153,COMUS.,Some roving robber calling to his fellows.
1154,COMUS.,
1155,COMUS.,"_Second Brother._ Heaven keep my sister! Again, again, and near!"
1156,COMUS.,"Best draw, and stand upon our guard."
1157,COMUS.,
1158,COMUS.,_Elder Brother._                     I'll hallo.
1159,COMUS.,"If he be friendly, he comes well: if not,"
1160,COMUS.,"Defence is a good cause, and Heaven be for us!"
1161,COMUS.,
1162,COMUS.,"_Enter the ATTENDANT SPIRIT, habited like a shepherd._"
1163,COMUS.,
1164,COMUS.,That hallo I should know. What are you? speak.                   490
1165,COMUS.,Come not too near; you fall on iron stakes else.
1166,COMUS.,
1167,COMUS.,_Spirit._ What voice is that? my young Lord? speak again.
1168,COMUS.,
1169,COMUS.,"_Second Brother._ O brother, 'tis my father's shepherd, sure."
1170,COMUS.,
1171,COMUS.,_Elder Brother._ Thyrsis! whose artful strains have oft delayed
1172,COMUS.,"The huddling brook to hear his madrigal,"
1173,COMUS.,And sweetened every musk-rose of the dale.
1174,COMUS.,"How camest thou here, good swain? Hath any ram"
1175,COMUS.,"Slipped from the fold, or young kid lost his dam,"
1176,COMUS.,Or straggling wether the pent flock forsook?
1177,COMUS.,How couldst thou find this dark sequestered nook?                500
1178,COMUS.,
1179,COMUS.,"_Spirit._ O my loved master's heir, and his next joy,"
1180,COMUS.,I came not here on such a trivial toy
1181,COMUS.,"As a strayed ewe, or to pursue the stealth"
1182,COMUS.,Of pilfering wolf; not all the fleecy wealth
1183,COMUS.,That doth enrich these downs is worth a thought
1184,COMUS.,"To this my errand, and the care it brought,"
1185,COMUS.,"But, oh! my virgin Lady, where is she?"
1186,COMUS.,How chance she is not in your company?
1187,COMUS.,
1188,COMUS.,"_Elder Brother._ To tell thee sadly, Shepherd, without blame"
1189,COMUS.,"Or our neglect, we lost her as we came.                          510"
1190,COMUS.,
1191,COMUS.,_Spirit._ Ay me unhappy! then my fears are true.
1192,COMUS.,
1193,COMUS.,"_Elder Brother._ What fears, good Thyrsis? Prithee briefly shew."
1194,COMUS.,
1195,COMUS.,_Spirit._ I'll tell ye. 'Tis not vain or fabulous
1196,COMUS.,(Though so esteemed by shallow ignorance)
1197,COMUS.,"What the sage poets, taught by the heavenly Muse,"
1198,COMUS.,Storied of old in high immortal verse
1199,COMUS.,"Of dire Chimeras and enchanted isles,"
1200,COMUS.,And rifted rocks whose entrance leads to Hell;
1201,COMUS.,"For such there be, but unbelief is blind."
1202,COMUS.,"Within the navel of this hideous wood,                         520"
1203,COMUS.,"Immured in cypress shades, a sorcerer dwells,"
1204,COMUS.,"Of Bacchus and of Circe born, great Comus,"
1205,COMUS.,"Deep skilled in all his mother's witcheries,"
1206,COMUS.,And here to every thirsty wanderer
1207,COMUS.,"By sly enticement gives his baneful cup,"
1208,COMUS.,"With many murmurs mixed, whose pleasing poison"
1209,COMUS.,"The visage quite transforms of him that drinks,"
1210,COMUS.,And the inglorious likeness of a beast
1211,COMUS.,"Fixes instead, unmoulding reason's mintage"
1212,COMUS.,Charáctered in the face. This have I learnt                      530
1213,COMUS.,Tending my flocks hard by i' the hilly crofts
1214,COMUS.,That brow this bottom glade; whence night by night
1215,COMUS.,He and his monstrous rout are heard to howl
1216,COMUS.,"Like stabled wolves, or tigers at their prey,"
1217,COMUS.,Doing abhorred rites to Hecate
1218,COMUS.,In their obscuréd haunts of inmost bowers.
1219,COMUS.,Yet have they many baits and guileful spells
1220,COMUS.,To inveigle and invite the unwary sense
1221,COMUS.,Of them that pass unweeting by the way.
1222,COMUS.,"This evening late, by then the chewing flocks                    540"
1223,COMUS.,Had ta'en their supper on the savoury herb
1224,COMUS.,"Of knot-grass dew-besprent, and were in fold,"
1225,COMUS.,I sat me down to watch upon a bank
1226,COMUS.,"With ivy canopied, and interwove"
1227,COMUS.,"With flaunting honeysuckle, and began,"
1228,COMUS.,"Wrapt in a pleasing fit of melancholy,"
1229,COMUS.,"To meditate my rural minstrelsy,"
1230,COMUS.,Till fancy had her fill. But ere a close
1231,COMUS.,"The wonted roar was up amidst the woods,"
1232,COMUS.,And filled the air with barbarous dissonance;                    550
1233,COMUS.,"At which I ceased, and listened them awhile,"
1234,COMUS.,Till an unusual stop of sudden silence
1235,COMUS.,Gave respite to the drowsy frighted steeds
1236,COMUS.,That draw the litter of close-curtained Sleep.
1237,COMUS.,At last a soft and solemn-breathing sound
1238,COMUS.,"Rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes,"
1239,COMUS.,"And stole upon the air, that even Silence"
1240,COMUS.,"Was took ere she was ware, and wished she might"
1241,COMUS.,"Deny her nature, and be never more,"
1242,COMUS.,"Still to be so displaced. I was all ear,                         560"
1243,COMUS.,And took in strains that might create a soul
1244,COMUS.,"Under the ribs of Death. But, oh! ere long"
1245,COMUS.,Too well I did perceive it was the voice
1246,COMUS.,"Of my most honoured Lady, your dear sister."
1247,COMUS.,"Amazed I stood, harrowed with grief and fear;"
1248,COMUS.,"And ""O poor hapless nightingale,"" thought I,"
1249,COMUS.,"""How sweet thou sing'st, how near the deadly snare!"""
1250,COMUS.,"Then down the lawns I ran with headlong haste,"
1251,COMUS.,"Through paths and turnings often trod by day,"
1252,COMUS.,"Till, guided by mine ear, I found the place                      570"
1253,COMUS.,"Where that damned wizard, hid in sly disguise"
1254,COMUS.,"(For so by certain signs I knew), had met"
1255,COMUS.,"Already, ere my best speed could prevent,"
1256,COMUS.,"The aidless innocent lady, his wished prey;"
1257,COMUS.,"Who gently asked if he had seen such two,"
1258,COMUS.,Supposing him some neighbour villager.
1259,COMUS.,"Longer I durst not stay, but soon I guessed"
1260,COMUS.,Ye were the two she meant; with that I sprung
1261,COMUS.,"Into swift flight, till I had found you here;"
1262,COMUS.,But further know I not.
1263,COMUS.,
1264,COMUS.,"_Second Brother._       O night and shades,                      580"
1265,COMUS.,How are ye joined with hell in triple knot
1266,COMUS.,"Against the unarmed weakness of one virgin,"
1267,COMUS.,Alone and helpless! Is this the confidence
1268,COMUS.,"You gave me, brother?"
1269,COMUS.,
1270,COMUS.,"_Elder Brother._          Yes, and keep it still;"
1271,COMUS.,Lean on it safely; not a period
1272,COMUS.,Shall be unsaid for me. Against the threats
1273,COMUS.,"Of malice or of sorcery, or that power"
1274,COMUS.,"Which erring men call Chance, this I hold firm:"
1275,COMUS.,"Virtue may be assailed, but never hurt,"
1276,COMUS.,"Surprised by unjust force, but not enthralled;                   590"
1277,COMUS.,"Yea, even that which Mischief meant most harm"
1278,COMUS.,Shall in the happy trial prove most glory.
1279,COMUS.,"But evil on itself shall back recoil,"
1280,COMUS.,"And mix no more with goodness, when at last,"
1281,COMUS.,"Gathered like scum, and settled to itself,"
1282,COMUS.,It shall be in eternal restless change
1283,COMUS.,"Self-fed and self-consumed. If this fail,"
1284,COMUS.,"The pillared firmament is rottenness,"
1285,COMUS.,"And earth's base built on stubble. But come, let's on!"
1286,COMUS.,Against the opposing will and arm of Heaven                      600
1287,COMUS.,May never this just sword be lifted up;
1288,COMUS.,"But, for that damned magician, let him be girt"
1289,COMUS.,With all the grisly legions that troop
1290,COMUS.,"Under the sooty flag of Acheron,"
1291,COMUS.,"Harpies and Hydras, or all the monstrous forms"
1292,COMUS.,"'Twixt Africa and Ind, I'll find him out,"
1293,COMUS.,"And force him to return his purchase back,"
1294,COMUS.,"Or drag him by the curls to a foul death,"
1295,COMUS.,Cursed as his life.
1296,COMUS.,
1297,COMUS.,"_Spirit._           Alas! good venturous youth,"
1298,COMUS.,"I love thy courage yet, and bold emprise;                        610"
1299,COMUS.,But here thy sword can do thee little stead.
1300,COMUS.,Far other arms and other weapons must
1301,COMUS.,Be those that quell the might of hellish charms.
1302,COMUS.,"He with his bare wand can unthread thy joints,"
1303,COMUS.,And crumble all thy sinews.
1304,COMUS.,
1305,COMUS.,"_Elder Brother._            Why, prithee, Shepherd,"
1306,COMUS.,How durst thou then thyself approach so near
1307,COMUS.,As to make this relation?
1308,COMUS.,
1309,COMUS.,_Spirit._                  Care and utmost shifts
1310,COMUS.,How to secure the Lady from surprisal
1311,COMUS.,"Brought to my mind a certain shepherd lad,"
1312,COMUS.,"Of small regard to see to, yet well skilled                      620"
1313,COMUS.,In every virtuous plant and healing herb
1314,COMUS.,That spreads her verdant leaf to the morning ray.
1315,COMUS.,"He loved me well, and oft would beg me sing;"
1316,COMUS.,"Which when I did, he on the tender grass"
1317,COMUS.,"Would sit, and hearken even to ecstasy,"
1318,COMUS.,"And in requital ope his leathern scrip,"
1319,COMUS.,"And show me simples of a thousand names,"
1320,COMUS.,Telling their strange and vigorous faculties.
1321,COMUS.,"Amongst the rest a small unsightly root,"
1322,COMUS.,"But of divine effect, he culled me out.                          630"
1323,COMUS.,"The leaf was darkish, and had prickles on it,"
1324,COMUS.,"But in another country, as he said,"
1325,COMUS.,"Bore a bright golden flower, but not in this soil:"
1326,COMUS.,"Unknown, and like esteemed, and the dull swain"
1327,COMUS.,Treads on it daily with his clouted shoon;
1328,COMUS.,And yet more med'cinal is it than that Moly
1329,COMUS.,That Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave.
1330,COMUS.,"He called it Hæmony, and gave it me,"
1331,COMUS.,And bade me keep it as of sovran use
1332,COMUS.,"'Gainst all enchantments, mildew blast, or damp,                 640"
1333,COMUS.,Or ghastly Furies' apparition.
1334,COMUS.,"I pursed it up, but little reckoning made,"
1335,COMUS.,Till now that this extremity compelled.
1336,COMUS.,But now I find it true; for by this means
1337,COMUS.,"I knew the foul enchanter, though disguised,"
1338,COMUS.,"Entered the very lime-twigs of his spells,"
1339,COMUS.,And yet came off. If you have this about you
1340,COMUS.,(As I will give you when we go) you may
1341,COMUS.,Boldly assault the necromancer's hall;
1342,COMUS.,"Where if he be, with dauntless hardihood                         650"
1343,COMUS.,"And brandished blade rush on him: break his glass,"
1344,COMUS.,And shed the luscious liquor on the ground;
1345,COMUS.,But seize his wand. Though he and his curst crew
1346,COMUS.,"Fierce sign of battle make, and menace high,"
1347,COMUS.,"Or, like the sons of Vulcan, vomit smoke,"
1348,COMUS.,"Yet will they soon retire, if he but shrink."
1349,COMUS.,
1350,COMUS.,"_Elder Brother._ Thyrsis, lead on apace; I'll follow thee;"
1351,COMUS.,And some good angel bear a shield before us!
1352,COMUS.,
1353,COMUS.,"_The Scene changes to a stately palace, set out with all manner of"
1354,COMUS.,"deliciousness: soft music, tables spread with all dainties. COMUS"
1355,COMUS.,"appears with his rabble, and the LADY set in an enchanted chair: to whom"
1356,COMUS.,"he offers his glass; which she puts by, and goes about to rise._"
1357,COMUS.,
1358,COMUS.,"_Comus._ Nay, lady, sit. If I but wave this wand,"
1359,COMUS.,"Your nerves are all chained up in alabaster,                     660"
1360,COMUS.,"And you a statue, or as Daphne was,"
1361,COMUS.,"Root-bound, that fled Apollo."
1362,COMUS.,
1363,COMUS.,"_Lady._                        Fool, do not boast."
1364,COMUS.,Thou canst not touch the freedom of my mind
1365,COMUS.,"With all thy charms, although this corporal rind"
1366,COMUS.,Thou hast immanacled while Heaven sees good.
1367,COMUS.,
1368,COMUS.,"_Comus._ Why are you vexed, lady? why do you frown?"
1369,COMUS.,"Here dwell no frowns, nor anger; from these gates"
1370,COMUS.,"Sorrow flies far. See, here be all the pleasures"
1371,COMUS.,"That fancy can beget on youthful thoughts,"
1372,COMUS.,"When the fresh blood grows lively, and returns                   670"
1373,COMUS.,Brisk as the April buds in primrose season.
1374,COMUS.,"And first behold this cordial julep here,"
1375,COMUS.,"That flames and dances in his crystal bounds,"
1376,COMUS.,With spirits of balm and fragrant syrups mixed.
1377,COMUS.,Not that Nepenthes which the wife of Thone
1378,COMUS.,In Egypt gave to Jove-born Helena
1379,COMUS.,"Is of such power to stir up joy as this,"
1380,COMUS.,"To life so friendly, or so cool to thirst."
1381,COMUS.,"Why should you be so cruel to yourself,"
1382,COMUS.,"And to those dainty limbs, which Nature lent                     680"
1383,COMUS.,For gentle usage and soft delicacy?
1384,COMUS.,"But you invert the covenants of her trust,"
1385,COMUS.,"And harshly deal, like an ill borrower,"
1386,COMUS.,"With that which you received on other terms,"
1387,COMUS.,Scorning the unexempt condition
1388,COMUS.,"By which all mortal frailty must subsist,"
1389,COMUS.,"Refreshment after toil, ease after pain,"
1390,COMUS.,"That have been tired all day without repast,"
1391,COMUS.,"And timely rest have wanted. But, fair virgin,"
1392,COMUS.,This will restore all soon.
1393,COMUS.,
1394,COMUS.,"_Lady._                     'Twill not, false traitor!           690"
1395,COMUS.,'Twill not restore the truth and honesty
1396,COMUS.,That thou hast banished from thy tongue with lies.
1397,COMUS.,Was this the cottage and the safe abode
1398,COMUS.,"Thou told'st me of? What grim aspects are these,"
1399,COMUS.,These oughly-headed monsters? Mercy guard me!
1400,COMUS.,"Hence with thy brewed enchantments, foul deceiver!"
1401,COMUS.,Hast thou betrayed my credulous innocence
1402,COMUS.,With vizored falsehood and base forgery?
1403,COMUS.,And would'st thou seek again to trap me here
1404,COMUS.,"With liquorish baits, fit to ensnare a brute?                    700"
1405,COMUS.,"Were it a draught for Juno when she banquets,"
1406,COMUS.,I would not taste thy treasonous offer. None
1407,COMUS.,But such as are good men can give good things;
1408,COMUS.,And that which is not good is not delicious
1409,COMUS.,To a well-governed and wise appetite.
1410,COMUS.,
1411,COMUS.,_Comus._ O foolishness of men! that lend their ears
1412,COMUS.,"To those budge doctors of the Stoic fur,"
1413,COMUS.,"And fetch their precepts from the Cynic tub,"
1414,COMUS.,Praising the lean and sallow Abstinence!
1415,COMUS.,Wherefore did Nature pour her bounties forth                     710
1416,COMUS.,"With such a full and unwithdrawing hand,"
1417,COMUS.,"Covering the earth with odours, fruits, and flocks,"
1418,COMUS.,"Thronging the seas with spawn innumerable,"
1419,COMUS.,But all to please and sate the curious taste?
1420,COMUS.,"And set to work millions of spinning worms,"
1421,COMUS.,"That in their green shops weave the smooth-haired silk,"
1422,COMUS.,"To deck her sons; and, that no corner might"
1423,COMUS.,"Be vacant of her plenty, in her own loins"
1424,COMUS.,"She hutched the all-worshipped ore and precious gems,"
1425,COMUS.,To store her children with. If all the world                     720
1426,COMUS.,"Should, in a pet of temperance, feed on pulse,"
1427,COMUS.,"Drink the clear stream, and nothing wear but frieze,"
1428,COMUS.,"The All-giver would be unthanked, would be unpraised,"
1429,COMUS.,"Not half his riches known, and yet despised;"
1430,COMUS.,"And we should serve him as a grudging master,"
1431,COMUS.,"As a penurious niggard of his wealth,"
1432,COMUS.,"And live like Nature's bastards, not her sons,"
1433,COMUS.,"Who would be quite surcharged with her own weight,"
1434,COMUS.,And strangled with her waste fertility:
1435,COMUS.,"The earth cumbered, and the winged air darked with plumes,       730"
1436,COMUS.,The herds would over-multitude their lords;
1437,COMUS.,"The sea o'erfraught would swell, and the unsought diamonds"
1438,COMUS.,"Would so emblaze the forehead of the deep,"
1439,COMUS.,"And so bestud with stars, that they below"
1440,COMUS.,"Would grow inured to light, and come at last"
1441,COMUS.,To gaze upon the sun with shameless brows.
1442,COMUS.,"List, lady; be not coy, and be not cozened"
1443,COMUS.,"With that same vaunted name, Virginity."
1444,COMUS.,"Beauty is Nature's coin; must not be hoarded,"
1445,COMUS.,But must be current; and the good thereof                        740
1446,COMUS.,"Consists in mutual and partaken bliss,"
1447,COMUS.,Unsavoury in the enjoyment of itself.
1448,COMUS.,"If you let slip time, like a neglected rose"
1449,COMUS.,It withers on the stalk with languished head.
1450,COMUS.,"Beauty is Nature's brag, and must be shown"
1451,COMUS.,"In courts, at feasts, and high solemnities,"
1452,COMUS.,Where most may wonder at the workmanship.
1453,COMUS.,It is for homely features to keep home;
1454,COMUS.,They had their name thence: coarse complexions
1455,COMUS.,And cheeks of sorry grain will serve to ply                      750
1456,COMUS.,"The sampler, and to tease the huswife's wool."
1457,COMUS.,"What need of vermeil-tinctured lip for that,"
1458,COMUS.,"Love-darting eyes, or tresses like the morn?"
1459,COMUS.,There was another meaning in these gifts;
1460,COMUS.,"Think what, and be advised; you are but young yet."
1461,COMUS.,
1462,COMUS.,_Lady._ I had not thought to have unlocked my lips
1463,COMUS.,"In this unhallowed air, but that this juggler"
1464,COMUS.,"Would think to charm my judgment, as mine eyes,"
1465,COMUS.,Obtruding false rules pranked in reason's garb.
1466,COMUS.,I hate when vice can bolt her arguments                          760
1467,COMUS.,And virtue has no tongue to check her pride.
1468,COMUS.,"Impostor! do not charge most innocent Nature,"
1469,COMUS.,As if she would her children should be riotous
1470,COMUS.,"With her abundance. She, good cateress,"
1471,COMUS.,"Means her provision only to the good,"
1472,COMUS.,"That live according to her sober laws,"
1473,COMUS.,And holy dictate of spare Temperance.
1474,COMUS.,If every just man that now pines with want

1539,COMUS.,Sabrina is her name: a virgin pure;
1540,COMUS.,"Whilom she was the daughter of Locrine,"
1541,COMUS.,That had the sceptre from his father Brute.
1542,COMUS.,"She, guiltless damsel, flying the mad pursuit"

1636,COMUS.,"Thrice upon thy finger's tip,"
1637,COMUS.,Thrice upon thy rubied lip:
1638,COMUS.,"Next this marble venomed seat,"
1639,COMUS.,"Smeared with gums of glutinous heat,"
1640,COMUS.,I touch with chaste palms moist and cold.
1641,COMUS.,Now the spell hath lost his hold;
1642,COMUS.,And I must haste ere morning hour                              920

1783,NOTES.,"plot of the whole masque, and at the same time compliments the Earl in"

1862,NOTES.,may suppose that the words 'mortal change' in line 10 have a similar
1863,NOTES.,meaning. Milton frequently uses 'mortal' in the sense of 'liable to
1864,NOTES.,"death,' and hence 'human' as opposed to 'divine': the mortal change is"
1865,NOTES.,"therefore 'the change which occurs to all human beings.' Comp. _Job_,"

2038,NOTES.,their connection with the court. _Lore_ is cognate with _learn_.
2039,NOTES.,
2040,NOTES.,35. ~their father's state~. This probably refers to the actual ceremonies

2052,NOTES.,
2053,NOTES.,"37. ~perplexed~, interwoven, entangled (Lat. _plecto_, to plait or"

2056,NOTES.,
2057,NOTES.,"38. ~horror~. This word is meant not merely to indicate terror, but also"
2058,NOTES.,"to describe the appearance of the paths. Horror is from Lat. _horrere_,"
2059,NOTES.,"to bristle, and may be rendered 'shagginess' or 'ruggedness,' just as"

2065,NOTES.,"39. ~Threats~: not current as a verb. ~forlorn~, now used only as an"

2070,NOTES.,
2071,NOTES.,40. ~tender age~. Lady Alice Egerton was about fourteen years of age; the
2072,NOTES.,two brothers were younger than she.
2073,NOTES.,
2074,NOTES.,"41. ~But that~, etc. Grammatically, _but_ may be regarded as a"
2075,NOTES.,subordinative conjunction = 'unless (it had happened) that I was
2076,NOTES.,"despatched': or, taking it in its original prepositional sense, we may"
2077,NOTES.,"regard it as governing the substantive clause, 'that ... guard.' ~quick"
2078,NOTES.,"command~: the adjective has the force of an adverb, quick commands being"
2079,NOTES.,"commands that are to be carried quickly. ~sovran~, supreme. This is"
2080,NOTES.,"Milton's spelling of the modern word _sovereign_, in which the _g_ is"
2081,NOTES.,due to the mistaken notion that the last syllable of the word is cognate
2082,NOTES.,with _reign_. The word is from Lat. _superanum_ = chief: comp. l. 639.
2083,NOTES.,
2084,NOTES.,"43. ~And listen why~; _sc._ 'I was despatched.' The language of lines 43,"
2085,NOTES.,"44 is suggested by Horace's _Odes_, iii. 1, 2: ""Favete linguis; carmina"
2086,NOTES.,"non prius Audita ... canto."" The poet implies that the plot of his mask"
2087,NOTES.,is original: it is not (he says) to be found in any ancient or modern
2088,NOTES.,song or tale that was ever recited either in the 'hall' (=
2089,NOTES.,banqueting-hall) or in the 'bower' (= private chamber). Or 'hall' and
2090,NOTES.,'bower' may denote respectively the room of the lord and that of his
2091,NOTES.,lady.
2092,NOTES.,
2093,NOTES.,46. Milton in his usual significant manner (comp. _L'Allegro_ and _Il
2094,NOTES.,"Penseroso_), proceeds to invent a genealogy for Comus. The mask is"
2095,NOTES.,designed to celebrate the victory of Purity and Reason over Desire and
2096,NOTES.,"Enchantment. Comus, who represents the latter, must therefore spring"
2097,NOTES.,from parents representing the pleasure of man's lower nature and the
2098,NOTES.,misuse of man's higher powers on behalf of falsehood and impurity. These
2099,NOTES.,"parents are the wine-god Bacchus and the sorceress Circe. The former,"
2100,NOTES.,"mated with Love, is the father of Mirth (see _L'Allegro_); but, mated"
2101,NOTES.,"with the cunning Circe, his offspring is a voluptuary whose gay"
2102,NOTES.,exterior and flattering speech hide his dangerously seductive and
2103,NOTES.,"magical powers. He bears no resemblance, therefore, to Comus as"
2104,NOTES.,"represented in Ben Jonson's _Pleasure reconciled to Virtue_, in which"
2105,NOTES.,"mask ""Comus"" and ""The Belly"" are throughout synonymous. In the"
2106,NOTES.,"_Agamemnon_ of Aeschylus, Comus is a ""drinker of human blood""; in"
2107,NOTES.,"Philostratus, he is a rose-crowned wine-bibber; in Dekker he is ""the"
2108,NOTES.,"clerk of gluttony's kitchen""; in Massinger he is ""the god of pleasure"";"
2109,NOTES.,"and in the work of Erycius Puteanus he is a graceful reveller, the"
2110,NOTES.,"genius of love and cheerfulness. Prof. Masson says, ""Milton's _Comus_ is"
2111,NOTES.,"a creation of his own, for which he was as little indebted intrinsically"
2112,NOTES.,to Puteanus as to Ben Jonson. For the purpose of his masque at Ludlow
2113,NOTES.,"Castle he was bold enough to add a brand-new god, no less, to the"
2114,NOTES.,"classic Pantheon, and to import him into Britain."" ~Bacchus~, the god who"
2115,NOTES.,"taught men the preparation of wine. He is the Greek Dionysus, who, on"
2116,NOTES.,"one of his voyages, hired a vessel belonging to some Tyrrhenian pirates:"
2117,NOTES.,"these men resolved to sell him as a slave. Thereupon, he changed the"
2118,NOTES.,mast and oars of the ship into serpents and the sailors into dolphins.
2119,NOTES.,The meeting of Bacchus with Circe is Milton's own invention; in the
2120,NOTES.,"_Odyssey_ it is Ulysses who lights upon her island: ""And we came to the"
2121,NOTES.,"isle Ææan, where dwelt Circe of the braided tresses, an awful goddess of"
2122,NOTES.,"mortal speech, own sister to the wizard Æetes,"" _Odys._ x. ~from out~,"

2124,NOTES.,more common 'out from.'

2126,NOTES.,"47. ~misusèd~, abused. The prefix _mis-_ was very generally used by"
2127,NOTES.,"Milton; _e.g._ _mislike_, _misdeem_, _miscreated_, _misthought_ (all"

2129,NOTES.,
2130,NOTES.,"48. ~After the Tuscan mariners transformed~, _i.e._ after the"
2131,NOTES.,"transformation of the Tuscan mariners (see Ovid, _Met._ iii.). They are"
2132,NOTES.,"called Tuscan, because Tyrrhenia in Central Italy was named Etruria or"
2133,NOTES.,Tuscia by the Romans: Etruria includes modern Tuscany. This grammatical
2134,NOTES.,construction is common in Latin; a passive participle combined with a
2135,NOTES.,substantive answering to an English verbal or abstract noun connected
2136,NOTES.,"with another noun by the preposition _of_, and used to denote a fact in"
2137,NOTES.,"the past; _e.g._ ""since created man"" (_P. L._ i. 573) = since the"
2138,NOTES.,"creation of man: ""this loss recovered"" (_P. L._ ii. 21) = the recovery"
2139,NOTES.,of this loss.

2142,NOTES.,"iii. 8, ""the wind bloweth where it _listeth_""; _Lyc._ 123. The verb"
2143,NOTES.,"_list_ is, in older English, generally used impersonally, and in Chaucer"
2144,NOTES.,we find 'if thee lust' or 'if thee list' = if it please thee. The word
2145,NOTES.,survives in the adjective _listless_ of which the older form was
2146,NOTES.,_lustless_: the noun _lust_ has lost its original and wider sense (which

2674,NOTES.,"_cognitus_, so that its primary sense is 'known' or 'remarkable.' In"
2675,NOTES.,"French it became _coint_, which was treated as if from Lat. _comptus_,"

2962,NOTES.,"Echo as the ""Sweet Queen of Parley"" and the unhappy lover of the lost"
2963,NOTES.,"Narcissus, the river is here mentioned because of its associations with"

2966,NOTES.,"contest with Apollo was carried into the Maeander and, after being"
2967,NOTES.,"thrown on land, dedicated to Apollo, the god of song. Comp. _Lyc._"

2969,NOTES.,"reference to Orpheus, whose 'gory visage' and lyre were carried ""down"

2971,NOTES.,"associated with the sorrows of the maiden Byblis, who seeks her lost"
2972,NOTES.,brother Caunus (called by Ovid _Maeandrius juvenis_). [Since the above
2973,NOTES.,"was written, Prof. J. W. Hales has given the following explanation of"
2974,NOTES.,"Milton's allusion: ""The real reason is that the Meander was a famous"
2975,NOTES.,"haunt of swans, and the swan was a favourite bird with the Greek and"
2976,NOTES.,"Latin writers--one to whose sweet singing they perpetually allude"""
2977,NOTES.,"(_Athenaeum_, April 20, 1889).] 'Margent.' _Marge_ and _margin_ are"

2979,NOTES.,
2980,NOTES.,233. ~the violet-embroidered vale~. The notion that flowers _broider_ or

2982,NOTES.,"""Under foot the violet, Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay"
2983,NOTES.,"_Broidered_ the ground."" In _Lyc._ 148, the flowers themselves wear"
2984,NOTES.,'embroidery.' The nightingale is made to haunt a violet-embroidered vale
2985,NOTES.,because these flowers are associated with love (see Jonson's _Masque of
2986,NOTES.,"Hymen_) and with innocence (see _Hamlet_, iv. 5. 158: ""I would give you"
2987,NOTES.,"some violets, but they withered all when my father died""). Prof. Hales,"
2988,NOTES.,"however, thinks that some particular vale is here alluded to, and"
2989,NOTES.,"argues, with much acumen, that the poet referred to the woodlands close"
2990,NOTES.,"by Athens to the north-west, through which the Cephissus flowed, and"
2991,NOTES.,"where stood the birthplace of Sophocles, who sings of his native Colonus"
2992,NOTES.,as frequented by nightingales. The same critic regards the epithet
2993,NOTES.,'violet-embroidered' as a translation of the Greek +iostephanos+ (=
2994,NOTES.,"crowned with violets), frequently applied by Aristophanes to Athens, of"
2995,NOTES.,"which Colonus was a suburb. Macaulay also refers to Athens as ""the"
2996,NOTES.,"violet-crowned city."" It is, at least, very probable that Milton might"
2997,NOTES.,"here associate the nightingale with Colonus, as he does in _Par. Reg._"
2998,NOTES.,iv. 245: see the following note.
2999,NOTES.,

3003,NOTES.,"through, and sitting on a bough, reproduces her piteous melody, and"
3004,NOTES.,"fills the country round with the plaints of her sorrow."" _Lorn_ and"
3005,NOTES.,"_lost_ are cognate words, the former being common in the compound"
3006,NOTES.,"_forlorn_: see note, l. 39. Milton makes frequent allusion to the"
3007,NOTES.,"nightingale: in _Il Penseroso_ it is 'Philomel'; in _Par. Reg._ iv. 245,"
3008,NOTES.,"it is 'the Attic bird'; and in _Par. Lost_ viii. 518, it is 'the amorous"
3009,NOTES.,bird of night.' He calls it the Attic bird in allusion to the story of
3010,NOTES.,"Philomela, the daughter of Pandion, King of Athens. Near the Academy was"
3011,NOTES.,"Colonus, which Sophocles has celebrated as the haunt of nightingales"
3012,NOTES.,"(Browne). Philomela was changed, at her own prayer, into a nightingale"
3013,NOTES.,that she might escape the vengeance of her brother-in-law Tereus. The
3014,NOTES.,"epithet 'love-lorn,' however, seems to point to the legend of A{=e}don"
3015,NOTES.,"(Greek +aêdôn+, a nightingale), who, having killed her own son by"
3016,NOTES.,"mistake, was changed into a nightingale, whose mournful song was"

3019,NOTES.,

3045,NOTES.,The metrical structure of this song should be noted: the lines vary in
3046,NOTES.,"length from two to six feet. The rhymes are few, and the effect is more"

5217,NOTES.,"cinnamon (growing) upon thy banks.' This makes 'banks' objective, and"
5218,NOTES.,'upon' a preposition: the only objection to this reading is that the
5219,NOTES.,notion of crowning the head upon the banks is peculiar. The difficulty
5220,NOTES.,vanishes when we recollect that Milton frequently connects two clauses
5221,NOTES.,with one subject rather loosely: the subject of the second clause is
5222,NOTES.,"'thou,' implied in 'thy lofty head.' An exact parallel to this is found"
5223,NOTES.,"in _L'Alleg._ 121, 122: 'whose bright eyes rain influence and _judge_"
5224,NOTES.,the prize'; also in _Il Pens._ 155-7; 'let my due feet never fail to
5225,NOTES.,"_walk ... and love_, etc.': also in _Lyc._ 88, 89. The explanation"
5226,NOTES.,adopted by Prof. Masson is that Milton had in view two Greek
5227,NOTES.,"verbs--+peristephanoô+, 'to put a crown round,' and +epistephanoô+, ""to"
5228,NOTES.,"put a crown upon"": thus, ""May thy lofty head be _crowned round_ with"
5229,NOTES.,"many a tower and terrace, and thy banks here and there be _crowned upon_"
5230,NOTES.,"with groves of myrrh and cinnamon."" This makes 'banks' nominative, and"

5240,NOTES.,
5241,NOTES.,946. ~not many furlongs~. These words are deliberately inserted to keep up
5242,NOTES.,"the illusion. It is probable that, in the actual representation of the"
5243,NOTES.,"mask, the scene representing the enchanted palace was removed when"
5244,NOTES.,"Comus's rout was driven off the stage, and a woodland scene redisplayed."
5245,NOTES.,This would give additional significance to these lines and to the change
5246,NOTES.,of scene after l. 957. 'Furlong' = furrow-long: it thus came to mean the
5247,NOTES.,"length of a field, and is now a measure of length."
5248,NOTES.,
5249,NOTES.,"949. ~many a friend~. 'Many a' is a peculiar idiom, which has been"
5250,NOTES.,explained in different ways. One view is that 'many' is a corruption of
5251,NOTES.,"the French _mesnie_, a train or company, and 'a' a corruption of the"
5252,NOTES.,"preposition 'of,' the singular noun being then substituted for the"
5253,NOTES.,plural through confusion of the preposition with the article. A more
5254,NOTES.,"correct view seems to be that 'many' is the A.S. _manig_, which was in"
5255,NOTES.,"old English used with a singular noun and without the article, _e.g._"
5256,NOTES.,_manig mann_ = many men. In the thirteenth century the indefinite
5257,NOTES.,"article began to be inserted; thus _mony enne thing_ = many a thing,"
5258,NOTES.,"just as we say 'what _a_ thing,' 'such _a_ thing.' This would seem to"
5259,NOTES.,"show that 'a' is not a corruption of 'of,' and that there is no"
5260,NOTES.,"connection with the French word _mesnie_. Milton, in this passage, uses"
5261,NOTES.,'many a friend' with a plural verb. ~gratulate~. The simple verb is now
5262,NOTES.,"replaced by the compound _congratulate_ (Lat. _gratulari_, to wish joy"
5263,NOTES.,to a person).

5278,NOTES.,"'holyday,' which shows the origin of the word. The accent in such"
5279,NOTES.,"compounds (comp. blue-bell, blackbird, etc.) falls on the adjective: it"
5280,NOTES.,is only in this way that the ear can tell whether the compound forms

5515,NOTES.,whether the word is a noun or an adjective. Milton uses the adjective
5516,NOTES.,"_sheeny_ (_Death of Fair Infant_, 48)."
5517,NOTES.,
5518,NOTES.,1004. ~Celestial Cupid~. The ordinary view of Cupid is given in the
5519,NOTES.,note to line 445; here he is the lover of Psyche (the human soul) to
5520,NOTES.,whom he is united after she has been purified by a life of trial and
5521,NOTES.,misfortune. The myth of Cupid and Psyche is as follows: Cupid was in
5522,NOTES.,"love with Psyche, but warned her that she must not seek to know who he"
5523,NOTES.,"was. Yielding to curiosity, however, she drew near to him with a lamp"
5524,NOTES.,"while he was asleep. A drop of the hot oil falling on him, he awoke, and"
5525,NOTES.,"fled from her. She now wandered from place to place, persecuted by"
5526,NOTES.,"Venus; but after great sorrow, during which she was secretly supported"
5527,NOTES.,"by Cupid, she became immortal and was united to him for ever. In this"
5528,NOTES.,"story Psyche represents the human soul (Gk. +psychê+), which is"
5529,NOTES.,disciplined and purified by earthly misfortune and so fitted for the
5530,NOTES.,"enjoyment of true happiness in heaven. Further, in Milton's Allegory it"
5531,NOTES.,is only the soul so purified that is capable of knowing true love: in
5532,NOTES.,"his _Apology for Smectymnuus_ he calls it that Love ""whose charming cup"
5533,NOTES.,"is only virtue,"" and whose ""first and chiefest office ... begins and"
5534,NOTES.,"ends in the soul, producing those happy twins of her divine generation,"
5535,NOTES.,"Knowledge and Virtue."" To this high and mystical love Milton again"
5536,NOTES.,alludes in _Epitaphium Damonis_:
5537,NOTES.,
5538,NOTES.,"""In other part, the expansive vault above,"
5539,NOTES.,"And there too, even there the god of love;"
5540,NOTES.,"With quiver armed he mounts, his torch displays"
5541,NOTES.,"A vivid light, his gem-tipt arrows blaze,"
5542,NOTES.,"Around his bright and fiery eyes he rolls,"
5543,NOTES.,"Nor aims at vulgar minds or little souls,"
5544,NOTES.,"Nor deigns one look below, but aiming high"
5545,NOTES.,Sends every arrow to the lofty sky;
5546,NOTES.,"Hence forms divine, and minds immortal, learn"
5547,NOTES.,"The power of Cupid, and enamoured burn."""

5556,NOTES.,"Comp. ""the _blest_ kingdoms meek of joy and love,"" _Lyc._ 177. ~are to be"

5559,NOTES.,"meaning on ""Jove hath sworn"" in the following line."
5560,NOTES.,
5561,NOTES.,1011. ~Youth and Joy~. Everlasting youth and joy are found only after the
5562,NOTES.,trials of earth are past. So Spenser makes Pleasure the daughter of
5563,NOTES.,"Cupid and Psyche, but she is ""the daughter late,"" _i.e._ she is possible"
5564,NOTES.,only to the purified soul. See also note on l. 1004.
5565,NOTES.,
5566,NOTES.,"1012. ~my task~, _i.e._ the task alluded to in line 18. This line is an"

5600,NOTES.,
5601,NOTES.,"1021. ~sphery chime~, _i.e._ the music of the spheres. ""To climb higher"
5602,NOTES.,"than the sphery chime"" means to ascend beyond the spheres into the"
5603,NOTES.,empyrean or true heaven--the abode of God and the purest Spirits. Milton
5604,NOTES.,therefore implies that by virtue alone can we come into God's presence.
5605,NOTES.,"See note on ""the starry quire,"" line 112. 'Chime' is strictly 'harmony,'"
5606,NOTES.,"as in ""silver _chime_,"" _Hymn Nat._ 128: the word is cognate with"
5607,NOTES.,_cymbal_.
5608,NOTES.,
5609,NOTES.,"1022, 3. ~if Virtue feeble were~, etc. A triumphant expression of that"
5610,NOTES.,"confidence in the invincibleness of virtue, when aided by Divine"
5611,NOTES.,"Providence, and therefore a fitting conclusion of the whole masque."
5612,NOTES.,Milton's whole life reveals his unshaken belief in the truth expressed
5613,NOTES.,in the last two lines of his _Comus_.
