159,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
160,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"The subject of this memoir was born on the 25th of October, 1735, at"
161,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Laurencekirk, in the county of Kincardine, Scotland. His father, James"
162,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Beattie, who kept a small shop in the village at the same time that he"
163,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"rented a little farm in the neighbourhood, was a man of considerable"
164,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"talents and acquirements:[A] his mother, too, was distinguished for her"
165,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"abilities. Our author, James, was the youngest of the six children of"
166,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,this respectable pair.
167,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
168,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"After his father's decease, which happened when he was only seven years"
169,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"old, his mother, by means of the emoluments derived from the shop and"
170,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the farm, was enabled to bring up her family in comfort. In the"
171,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"management of her affairs she was assisted by her eldest son, David, a"
172,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"youth of eighteen, who generously and affectionately relinquished all"
173,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"other pursuits for that of promoting her welfare and happiness, and who"
174,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,appears to have fostered his brothers and sisters with an almost
175,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"parental care. James was placed at the parish school of Laurencekirk,"
176,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"which was then in some repute, and of which, about forty years before,"
177,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Ruddiman, the famous grammarian, had been the master. At this time he"
178,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"had access to few books, except those which the minister of the village"
179,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"(the Rev. Mr. Thomson) kindly lent him, and which he read with avidity."
180,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,It was then that he first became acquainted with English versification
181,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,in Ogilby's Virgil. Even then he was known among his schoolfellows by
182,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the name of _the poet_; and sometimes he would rise from bed, during the"
183,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"night, that he might commit to writing any poetical idea that his fancy"
184,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,had happened to suggest.
185,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
186,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"In 1749 he began his academical career, at the Marischal College,"
187,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Aberdeen:[B] and as his circumstances were straitened, he became a"
188,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"competitor--and with success--for one of those bursaries or exhibitions,"
189,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,which are annually bestowed on students who are unable to support the
190,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,entire expenses of a university education. He attended the Greek class
191,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"taught by Dr. Blackwell. This scholar, whose writings on classical"
192,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"subjects,[C] though now fallen into disrepute, once enjoyed considerable"
193,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"popularity, soon discovered that his pupil was no ordinary young man,"
194,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,and distinguished him by several encouraging marks of approbation. The
195,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"kindness of the Professor made a deep impression on the mind of Beattie,"
196,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"and he used to declare, in after life, that Blackwell was the first"
197,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,person who gave him reason to believe that he was possessed of any
198,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,genius. During the four years of his attendance at the Marischal College
199,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,he also studied philosophy and divinity. The last mentioned branch of
200,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"knowledge he pursued doubtless with a view to the ministry, the church"
201,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,being then the chief resource of the well educated sons of the poorer
202,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"classes in Scotland: he, however, soon abandoned all thoughts of the"
203,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,clerical profession.
204,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
205,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Having taken the degree of M. A., he was elected, on the 1st of August,"
206,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"1753, schoolmaster of Fordoun, a small hamlet at the foot of the"
207,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Grampian hills, about six miles distant from his birthplace: here also"
208,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"he officiated as præcentor, or parish-clerk."
209,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
210,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,Many an hour was now spent by Beattie in perfect solitude; the family of
211,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Mr. Forbes, the minister, being almost the only society, save the"
212,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"surrounding peasantry, which his situation allowed him to enjoy. But his"
213,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"days went happily by. When not occupied by his public duties, he appears"
214,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,to have devoted a portion of his time to the study of the classics;[D]
215,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"and occasionally he amused himself by composing little poems, a few of"
216,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,which were printed in the Scots Magazine. His fondness for music had
217,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,ever been decided; and in his present retirement he cultivated it with
218,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,uncommon success.[E] In the grand and beautiful scenery of the
219,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,neighbourhood he found a never-failing source of pleasure. Not far from
220,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the place where he dwelt, a large and well wooded glen communicates with"
221,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,the mountains. In it he loved to wander; in it some of his earliest
222,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,verses were written; and his recollections of its wild and romantic
223,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,charms may be traced in several vivid descriptions of nature in his
224,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,poetical works. Sometimes he would pass the whole night among the
225,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"fields, gazing on the sky, and observing the various aspects it assumed"
226,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"till the return of day; and the exhilarating song of ""the lyric lark"""
227,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"in the mornings of summer used to fill him with delight. In 1755, his"
228,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"loneliness was cheered by the arrival of his brother David, who came to"
229,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,settle himself at the village of Fordoun.
230,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
231,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"The celebrated and eccentric Francis Garden, Esq., (afterwards one of"
232,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the judges of the supreme courts of civil and criminal law in Scotland,"
233,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"by the title of Lord Gardenstone,) who was then sheriff of the county of"
234,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Kincardine, and occasionally resided in the neighbourhood of Fordoun,"
235,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,was the earliest patron of our author. They accidentally became
236,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,acquainted with each Other. Mr. Garden having one day discovered Beattie
237,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"busily writing with a pencil in his favourite glen, and learning that he"
238,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"was engaged in the composition of a poem,[F] from that period took him"
239,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,under his protection.
240,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
241,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,At this time too he became known to another more celebrated and more
242,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"eccentric character, Lord Monboddo, whose family estate is in the parish"
243,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,of Fordoun; and though their opinions on some important points by no
244,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"means coincided, they ever after lived on friendly terms."
245,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
246,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"In 1757, the place of usher in the grammar-school of Aberdeen being"
247,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"vacant, Beattie, by the advice of Mr. Forbes, the minister of Fordoun,"
248,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"became a candidate for it, but without success. So conspicuously,"
249,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"however, had his abilities manifested themselves during his examination"
250,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"on that occasion, that the same place becoming again vacant about a year"
251,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"after, and two candidates having appeared, both of whom were declared"
252,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"unqualified for it, he was requested by the magistrates to fill it"
253,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,without further trial. He was accordingly elected to the office on the
254,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"20th June, 1758."
255,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
256,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"This was an important event in Beattie's life. From a secluded hamlet,"
257,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,where there was the greatest difficulty in obtaining either society or
258,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"books, he was transplanted to a populous and flourishing town, where he"
259,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"might associate with those whose tastes were congenial with his own, and"
260,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,carry on his literary pursuits by means of public libraries. The friend
261,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"of his earlier years, Professor Blackwell, had sunk into the grave; but"
262,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,he had soon the good fortune to become intimately acquainted with
263,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"several persons of acknowledged talents and learning, connected with the"
264,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Marischal and King's Colleges, as also with various well educated"
265,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"gentlemen, inhabitants of the town."
266,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
267,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"In 1760, a chair in the Marischal College becoming vacant, it was"
268,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"suggested to Beattie by his friend, Mr. Arbuthnot,[G] that he should"
269,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"endeavour to procure the appointment for himself. Our author, who had"
270,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"never dreamed of aspiring to so dignified a situation, heard the"
271,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"proposal with astonishment. Mr. Arbuthnot, however, ""willing to try what"
272,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"could be done,"" induced the Earl of Erroll, with whom he was on intimate"
273,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"terms, to solicit, by means of Lord Milton, the powerful interest of the"
274,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,Duke of Argyll in behalf of the humble usher. The application proved
275,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"successful; and on the 8th October, 1760, Beattie was installed"
276,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,Professor of Moral Philosophy and Logic in the Marischal College.
277,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
278,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"His first lectures were delivered during the winter session of 1760, and"
279,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,1761; and for the long space of more than thirty years he continued to
280,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,discharge most conscientiously the duties of the important station to
281,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,which he had been so unexpectedly raised.
282,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
283,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,A literary and convivial club (to which the vulgar gave the nickname of
284,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the _Wise Club_) had been established for some years at Aberdeen, the"
285,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,members consisting of the Professors of the Marischal and King's
286,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Colleges, and of gentlemen of the town, who had a taste for literature"
287,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,and conversation. Into this society Beattie was now enrolled. They used
288,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"to meet at a tavern, once a fortnight, at five o'clock in the"
289,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"afternoon, (for in those days the common dinner-hour was early) when,"
290,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the president taking the chair, an essay was read, composed by one of"
291,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the members in his turn, and a literary or philosophical subject"
292,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"discussed; at half past eight a slight meal was served up, and at ten"
293,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"they retired to their homes. To this club Dr. Reid, Dr. Campbell, Dr."
294,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Gerrard, and Dr. Gregory, belonged; and from it several admired works of"
295,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,philosophy and criticism may be said to have originated.
296,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
297,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"In 1761 Beattie made his first appearance in print, in his own"
298,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"character, by publishing a small volume, dedicated to the Earl of"
299,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Erroll, entitled _Original Poems and Translations_. It consisted partly"
300,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"of some of the verses which he had formerly sent to the Scots Magazine,"
301,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"and partly of pieces which he had recently composed. ""This collection,"""
302,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"says his good-natured and not very tasteful biographer, Sir William"
303,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Forbes, ""was very favourably received, and stamped Dr. Beattie with the"
304,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"character of a poet of great and original genius."" It was certainly"
305,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""favourably received,"" the chief critical journals of the day being"
306,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"unanimous in its praise; but that it ""stamped the author with the"
307,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"character of a poet of great and original genius,"" I cannot allow. The"
308,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"truth is, it does not contain a single poem which rises much above"
309,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,mediocrity; and if Beattie had never touched the lyre with a more
310,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"powerful hand, a memoir of his life would not have been required for"
311,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the Aldine Poets. So lightly, indeed, did he himself afterwards think of"
312,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the collection in question, that he used to destroy all the copies of it"
313,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"which he could procure, and would only suffer four pieces from it (and"
314,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,these much altered and improved) to stand in the same volume with _The
315,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,Minstrel_.
316,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
317,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"During the summer of 1763, Beattie for the first time visited London,"
318,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"among the inhabitants of which, Millar, his publisher, was almost his"
319,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"only acquaintance. While residing there, he made a pilgrimage to Pope's"
320,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,villa at Twickenham.
321,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
322,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"_The Judgment of Paris_, printed in 4to, in 1765, was the least"
323,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,successful of our author's poetical works. Several passages of
324,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"considerable beauty could not prevent this elaborate, cold, and"
325,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,metaphysical production from being utterly neglected by the public.
326,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
327,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,That his _Verses on the death of Churchill_ (which appeared anonymously
328,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"very soon after _The Judgment of Paris_) were read with more attention,"
329,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,is to be attributed rather to the subject of the piece than to its
330,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,intrinsic merit.[H] No one can peruse it without regretting that the
331,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,amiable Beattie should have been betrayed by political feelings into
332,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"such virulent abuse of a man of genius, who had just been gathered to"
333,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,the poets of other days. He is said to have written it at the
334,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"solicitation of certain friends in Scotland, where the name of Churchill"
335,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,was held in detestation; and on these injudicious instigators let a
336,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,portion of the odium rest.
337,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
338,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"In the autumn of 1765, Gray, who was then regarded as the first of"
339,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"living bards, paid a visit to the Earl of Strathmore, at Glammis castle."
340,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,No sooner did Beattie hear of his arrival than he addressed to him the
341,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,following letter:
342,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
343,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Marischal College of Aberdeen, 30th August, 1765."
344,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
345,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""If I thought it necessary to offer an apology for venturing to"
346,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"address you in this abrupt manner, I should be very much at a loss"
347,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"how to begin. I might plead my admiration of your genius, and my"
348,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"attachment to your character; but who is he that could not, with"
349,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"truth, urge the same excuse for intruding upon your retirement? I"
350,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,might plead my earnest desire to be personally acquainted with a man
351,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,whom I have so long and so passionately admired in his writings; but
352,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"thousands of greater consequence than I, are ambitious of the same"
353,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"honour. I, indeed, must either flatter myself that no apology is"
354,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"necessary, or otherwise I must despair of obtaining what has long"
355,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,been the object of my most ardent wishes; I must forever forfeit
356,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"all hopes of seeing you, and conversing with you."
357,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
358,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""It was yesterday I received the agreeable news of your being in"
359,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Scotland, and of your intending to visit some parts of it. Will you"
360,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"permit us to hope, that we shall have an opportunity, at Aberdeen,"
361,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"of thanking you in person, for the honour you have done to Britain,"
362,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"and to the poetic art, by your inestimable compositions, and of"
363,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"offering you all that we have that deserves your acceptance, namely,"
364,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"hearts full of esteem, respect, and affection? If you cannot come so"
365,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"far northward, let me at least be acquainted with the place of your"
366,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"residence, and permitted to wait on you. Forgive, sir, this request;"
367,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"forgive me if I urge it with earnestness, for indeed it concerns me"
368,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"nearly; and do me the justice to believe, that I am, with the most"
369,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"sincere attachment, and most respectful esteem, &c. &c. &c."
370,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
371,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""P. S. Dr. Carlysle of Musselburgh, and Dr. Wight of Glasgow,"
372,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,acquainted me of your being in Scotland. It was from them I learned
373,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"that my name was not wholly unknown to you."""
374,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
375,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"In consequence of this letter, Beattie received an invitation to Glammis"
376,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,castle; and a friendship and correspondence commenced between the two
377,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"poets, which terminated only with the death of Gray. The impression"
378,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,which their first meeting made on our author he thus describes in a
379,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"letter to Sir William Forbes:--""I am sorry you did not see Mr. Gray on"
380,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,his return; you would have been much pleased with him. Setting aside his
381,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"merit as a poet, which, however, in my opinion, is greater than any of"
382,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"his contemporaries can boast, in this or in any other nation, I found"
383,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"him possessed of the most exact taste, the soundest judgment, and the"
384,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,most extensive learning. He is happy in a singular facility of
385,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"expression. His conversation abounds in original observations, delivered"
386,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"with no appearance of sententious formality, and seeming to arise"
387,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,spontaneously without study or premeditation. I passed two very
388,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"agreeable days with him in Glammis, and found him as easy in his"
389,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"manners, and as communicative and frank, as I could have wished."""
390,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
391,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,A new edition of our author's Poems came forth in 1766. From it a large
392,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,portion of the pieces published in the former collection was rejected;
393,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"while _The Judgment of Paris_, the _Lines on the Death of Churchill_,"
394,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"and one or two copies of verses never before printed, supplied the"
395,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"deficiency. The translation of Addison's _Pygmæogeranomachia_, which"
396,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"concludes the volume, is remarkable for its spirited and graceful"
397,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,versification.
398,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
399,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"In a letter to Dr. Blacklock, dated 22d September in the same year,"
400,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Beattie thus alludes to his great work, _The Minstrel_:--"
401,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
402,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""Not long ago I began a poem in the style and stanza of Spenser, in"
403,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"which I propose to give full scope to my inclination, and be either"
404,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"droll or pathetic, descriptive or sentimental, tender or satirical, as"
405,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the humour strikes me; for, if I mistake not, the manner which I have"
406,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,adopted admits equally of all these kinds of composition. I have written
407,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"one hundred and fifty lines, and am surprised to find the structure of"
408,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"that complicated stanza so little troublesome. I was always fond of it,"
409,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,for I think it the most harmonious that ever was contrived. It admits of
410,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,more variety of pauses than either the couplet or the alternate rhyme;
411,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"and it concludes with a pomp and majesty of sound, which, to my ear, is"
412,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,wonderfully delightful. It seems also very well adapted to the genius of
413,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"our language, which, from its irregularity of inflexion and number of"
414,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"monosyllables, abounds in diversified terminations, and consequently"
415,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,renders our poetry susceptible of an endless variety of legitimate
416,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"rhymes. But I am so far from intending this performance for the press,"
417,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,that I am morally certain it never will be finished. I shall add a
418,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"stanza now and then, when I am at leisure, and when I have no humour for"
419,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,any other amusement; but I am resolved to write no more poetry with a
420,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"view to publication, till I see some dawnings of a poetical taste among"
421,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the generality of readers, of which, however, there is not at present"
422,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"any thing like an appearance."""
423,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
424,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Writing to Sir William Forbes, 8th January, 1767, our author gives an"
425,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"account of the cause of his composing _The Hermit_, the most perfect of"
426,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,his minor poems:--
427,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
428,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""The favourable reception you gave to my little poem, demands my"
429,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"acknowledgments. I aimed at simplicity in the expression, and something"
430,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,like uncommonness in the thought; and I own I am not ill pleased with it
431,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,upon the whole; though I am sensible it does not answer the purpose for
432,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,which I made it. I wrote it at the desire of a young lady of this
433,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"country, who has a taste both for poetry and music, and wanted me to"
434,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"make words for a Scots tune called 'Pentland Hills,' of which she is"
435,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,very fond. The verses correspond well enough with the measure and
436,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"subject of the tune, but are extremely unsuitable for the purpose of a"
437,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"song.""[I]"
438,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
439,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,To Dr. Blacklock he again writes concerning _The Minstrel_:
440,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
441,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""Aberdeen, 20th May, 1767."
442,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
443,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""MY performance in Spenser's stanza has not advanced a single line"
444,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,these many months. It is called 'The Minstrel.' The subject was
445,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"suggested by a dissertation on the old minstrels, which is prefixed"
446,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"to a collection of Ballads lately published by Dodsley, in three"
447,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"volumes. I propose to give an account of the birth, education, and"
448,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,adventures of one of those bards; in which I shall have full scope
449,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"for description, sentiment, satire, and even a certain species of"
450,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"humour and of pathos, which, in the opinion of my great master are"
451,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"by no means inconsistent, as is evident from his works. My hero is"
452,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,to be born in the south of Scotland; which you know was the native
453,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,land of the English minstrels; I mean of those minstrels who
454,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"travelled into England, and supported themselves there by singing"
455,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,their ballads to the harp. His father is a shepherd. The son will
456,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"have a natural taste for music and the beauties of nature; which,"
457,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"however, languishes for want of culture, till in due time he meets"
458,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"with a hermit, who gives him some instruction; but endeavours to"
459,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"check his genius for poetry and adventures, by representing the"
460,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"happiness of obscurity and solitude, and the bad reception which"
461,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,poetry has met with in almost every age. The poor swain acquiesces
462,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"in this advice, and resolves to follow his father's employment;"
463,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"when, on a sudden, the country is invaded by the Danes, or English"
464,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"borderers, (I know not which,) and he is stript of all his little"
465,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"fortune, and obliged by necessity to commence minstrel. This is all"
466,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,that I have as yet concerted of the plan. I have written one hundred
467,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"and fifty lines, but my hero is not yet born, though now in a fair"
468,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"way of being so, for his parents are described and married. I know"
469,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"not whether I shall ever proceed any farther: however, I am not"
470,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"dissatisfied with what I have written."""
471,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
472,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"On the 28th June, 1767, Beattie was married at Aberdeen to Miss Mary"
473,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Dun, only daughter of the rector of the Grammar-school in that city; a"
474,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,mutual attachment having for some time existed between them. She was a
475,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"few years younger than our author: her person was pleasing, her manners"
476,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,were lively; and she possessed a moderate share of accomplishments. This
477,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"union, which seemed to promise nothing but happiness to Beattie, threw"
478,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the blight of misery over his later years, and undoubtedly contributed"
479,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,to shorten his career. The woman whom he had selected as a partner for
480,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"life, inherited from her mother the most dreadful of human"
481,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"maladies,--insanity; which, a few years after marriage, displayed itself"
482,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"in strange follies and caprices,[J] and at last broke forth with such"
483,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"violence, as to render her separation from her family absolutely"
484,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"necessary. By this lady he had two sons, of whom particular mention"
485,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,will be made hereafter.
486,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
487,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Beattie now employed himself on the composition of his _Essay on Truth_,"
488,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"a work, which was to be honoured with such marks of public approbation,"
489,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,as the most sanguine author in his wildest dreams of success could
490,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"hardly have anticipated. In a letter to Sir William Forbes, dated 17th"
491,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"January, 1768, he says:--"
492,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
493,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""I have, for a time, laid aside my favourite studies, that I might have"
494,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"leisure to prosecute a philosophical inquiry, less amusing indeed than"
495,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"poetry and criticism, but not less important. The extraordinary success"
496,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,of the sceptical philosophy has long filled me with regret. I wish I
497,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,could undeceive mankind in regard to this matter. Perhaps this wish is
498,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,vain: but it can do no harm to make the trial. The point I am now
499,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"labouring to prove, is the universality and immutability of moral"
500,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"sentiment,--a point which has been brought into dispute, both by the"
501,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,friends and by the enemies of virtue. In an age less licentious in its
502,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"principles, it would not, perhaps, be necessary to insist much on this"
503,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,point. At present it is very necessary. Philosophers have ascribed all
504,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,religion to human policy. Nobody knows how soon they may ascribe all
505,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"morality to the same origin; and then the foundations of human society,"
506,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"as well as of human happiness, will be effectually undermined. To"
507,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"accomplish this end, Hobbes, Hume, Mandeville, and even Locke, have"
508,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"laboured; and, I am sorry to say, from my knowledge of mankind, that"
509,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,their labour has not been altogether in vain. Not that the works of
510,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"these philosophers are generally read, or even understood by the few who"
511,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"read them. It is not the mode, now-a-days, for a man to think for"
512,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"himself; but they greedily adopt the conclusions, without any concern"
513,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,about the arguments or principles whence they proceed; and they justify
514,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,their own credulity by general declamations upon the transcendent merit
515,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"of their favourite authors, and the universal deference that is paid to"
516,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,their genius and learning. If I can prove those authors guilty of gross
517,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"misrepresentations of matters of fact, unacquainted with the human"
518,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"heart, ignorant even of their own principles, the dupes of verbal"
519,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"ambiguities, and the votaries of frivolous, though dangerous philosophy,"
520,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,I shall do some little service to the cause of truth; and all this I
521,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"will undertake to prove in many instances of high importance."""

523,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"During this year, a poem in broad Scotch, entitled _The Fortunate"
524,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Shepherdess_, by Alexander Ross, schoolmaster, of Lochlee, was printed"
525,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,by subscription at Aberdeen; and in order to excite some curiosity about

545,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"ninety pages in quarto are finished, and materials provided for as"
546,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,many more. The design of the whole you will guess from the part you
547,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"have seen. It is to overthrow scepticism, and establish conviction"
548,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,in its place; a conviction not in the least favourable to bigotry or
549,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"prejudice, far less to a persecuting spirit; but such a conviction"
550,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"as produces firmness of mind, and stability of principle, in a"
551,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"consistence with moderation, candour, and liberal inquiry. If I"
552,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"understand my own design, it is certainly this; whether I shall"
553,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"accomplish this design or not, the event only will determine."
554,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,Meantime I go on with cheerfulness in this intricate and fatiguing
555,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"study, because I would fain hope that it may do some good; harm I"
556,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,think it cannot possibly do any.
557,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
558,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""Perhaps you are anxious to know what first induced me to write on"
559,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,the subject; I will tell you as briefly as I can. In my younger days
560,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"I read chiefly for the sake of amusement, and I found myself best"
561,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"amused with the classics, and what we call the _belles lettres_."
562,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,Metaphysics I disliked; mathematics pleased me better; but I found
563,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,my mind neither improved nor gratified by that study. When
564,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Providence allotted me my present station, it became incumbent on me"
565,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,to read what had been written on the subject of morals and human
566,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"nature; the works of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, were celebrated as"
567,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"masterpieces in this way; to them, therefore, I had recourse. But,"
568,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"as I begin to study them with great prejudices in their favour, you"
569,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"will readily conceive how strangely I was surprised to find them, as"
570,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"I thought, replete with absurdities. I pondered these absurdities: I"
571,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"weighed the arguments, with which I was sometimes not a little"
572,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"confounded; and the result was, that I began at last to suspect my"
573,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"own understanding, and to think that I had not capacity for such a"
574,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"study. For I could not conceive it possible, that the absurdities of"
575,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"these authors were so great as they seemed to me to be; otherwise,"
576,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"thought I, the world would never admire them so much. About this"
577,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"time some excellent antisceptical works made their appearance,"
578,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,particularly Reid's 'Inquiry into the Human Mind.' Then it was that
579,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"I began to have a little more confidence in my own judgment, when I"
580,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,found it confirmed by those of whose abilities I did not entertain
581,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the least distrust. I reviewed my authors again, with a very"
582,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,different temper of mind. A very little truth will sometimes
583,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,enlighten a vast extent of science. I found that the sceptical
584,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"philosophy was not what the world imagined it to be, nor what I,"
585,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"following the opinion of the world, had hitherto imagined it to be,"
586,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"but a frivolous, though dangerous, system of verbal subtilty, which"
587,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"it required neither genius, nor learning, nor taste, nor knowledge"
588,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"of mankind, to be able to put together; but only a captious temper,"
589,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"an irreligious spirit, a moderate command of words, and an"
590,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,extraordinary degree of vanity and presumption. You will easily
591,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,perceive that I am speaking of this philosophy only in its most
592,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"extravagant state, that is, as it appears in the works of Mr. Hume."
593,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"The more I study it, the more am I confirmed in this opinion. But"
594,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"while I applauded and admired the sagacity of those who led me into,"
595,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"or at least encouraged me to proceed in, this train of thinking, I"
596,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,was not altogether satisfied with them in another respect. I could
597,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,not approve that extraordinary adulation which some of them paid to
598,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,their arch-adversary. I could not conceive the propriety of paying
599,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"compliments to a man's _heart_, at the very time one is proving that"
600,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"his aim is to subvert the principles of truth, virtue, and religion;"
601,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"nor to his _understanding_, when we are charging him with publishing"
602,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,the grossest and most contemptible nonsense. I thought I then
603,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"foresaw, what I have since found to happen, that this controversy"
604,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,will be looked upon rather as a trial of skill between two
605,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"logicians, than as a disquisition in which the best interests of"
606,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"mankind were concerned; and that the world, especially the"
607,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"fashionable part of it, would still be disposed to pay the greatest"
608,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"deference to the opinions of him who, even by the acknowledgment of"
609,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"his antagonists, was confessed to be the best philosopher and the"
610,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"soundest reasoner. All this has happened, and more. Some, to my"
611,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"certain knowledge, have said, that Mr. Hume and his adversaries did"
612,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"really act in concert, in order mutually to promote the sale of one"
613,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"another's works; as a proof of which, they mention, not only the"
614,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"extravagant compliments that pass between them, but also the"
615,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,circumstance of Dr. R.[L] and Dr. C.[M] sending their manuscripts to
616,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,be perused and corrected by Mr. Hume before they gave them to the
617,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"press. I, who know both the men, am very sensible of the gross"
618,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"falsehood of these reports. As to the affair of the manuscripts, it"
619,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"was, I am convinced, candour and modesty that induced them to it."
620,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"But the world knows no such thing; and, therefore, may be excused"
621,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,for mistaking the meaning of actions that have really an equivocal
622,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"appearance. I know likewise that they are sincere, not only in the"
623,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"detestation they express for Mr. Hume's irreligious tenets, but also"
624,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,in the compliments they have paid to his talents; for they both look
625,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,upon him as an extraordinary genius; a point in which I cannot agree
626,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"with them. But while I thus vindicate them from imputations, which"
627,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the world, from its ignorance of circumstances, has laid to their"
628,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"charge, I cannot approve them in every thing; I wish they had"
629,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"carried their researches a little farther, and expressed themselves"
630,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"with a little more firmness and spirit. For well I know, that their"
631,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"works, for want of this, will never produce that effect which (if"
632,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,all mankind were cool metaphysical reasoners) might be expected from
633,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,them. There is another thing in which my judgment differs
634,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,considerably from that of the gentlemen just mentioned. They have
635,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"great metaphysical abilities, and they love the metaphysical"
636,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,sciences. I do not. I am convinced that this metaphysical spirit is
637,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the bane of true learning, true taste, and true science; that to it"
638,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,we owe all this modern scepticism and atheism; that it has a bad
639,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"effect upon the human faculties, and tends not a little to sour the"
640,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"temper, to subvert good principles, and to disqualify men for the"
641,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,business of life. You will now see wherein my views differ from
642,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"those of the other answerers of Mr. Hume. I want to show the world,"
643,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"that the sceptical philosophy is contradictory to itself, and"
644,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"destructive of genuine philosophy, as well as of religion and"
645,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,virtue; that it is in its own nature so paltry a thing (however it
646,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"may have been celebrated by some,) that to be despised it needs only"
647,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,to be known; that no degree of genius is necessary to qualify a man
648,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,for making a figure in this pretended science; but rather a certain
649,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"minuteness and suspiciousness of mind, and want of sensibility, the"
650,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,very reverse of true intellectual excellence; that metaphysics
651,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"cannot possibly do any good, but may do, and actually have done,"
652,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"much harm; that sceptical philosophers, whatever they may pretend,"
653,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"are the corrupters of science, the pests of society, and the enemies"
654,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"of mankind. I want to show, that the same method of reasoning, which"
655,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"these people have adopted in their books, if transferred into common"
656,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"life, would show them to be destitute of common sense; that true"
657,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"philosophers follow a different method of reasoning: and that,"
658,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"without following a different method, no truth can be discovered. I"
659,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"want to lay before the public, in as strong a light as possible, the"
660,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,following dilemma: our sceptics either believe the doctrines they
661,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"publish, or they do not believe them: if they believe them, they are"
662,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"fools--if not, they are a thousand times worse. I want also to"
663,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"fortify the mind against the sceptical poison, and to propose"
664,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"certain criteria of moral truth, by which some of the most dangerous"
665,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,sceptical errors may be detected and guarded against.
666,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
667,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""You are sensible, that, in order to attain these ends, it is"
668,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,absolutely necessary for me to use great plainness of speech. My
669,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,expressions must not be so tame as to seem to imply either a
670,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"diffidence in my principles, or a coldness towards the cause I have"
671,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,undertaken to defend. And where is the man who can blame me for
672,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"speaking from the heart, and therefore speaking with warmth, when I"
673,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"appear in the cause of truth, religion, virtue, and mankind? I am"
674,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"sure my dear friend Dr. Blacklock will not; he, who has set before"
675,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"me so many examples of this laudable ardour; he, whose style I"
676,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"should be proud to take for my model, if I were not aware of the"
677,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"difficulty, I may say, the insuperable difficulty, of imitating it"
678,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"with success. You need not fear, however, that I expose myself by an"
679,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"excess of passion or petulance. I hope I shall be animated, without"
680,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"losing my temper, and keen, without injury to good manners. In a"
681,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"word, I will be as soft and delicate as the subject and my"
682,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"conscience will allow. One gentleman, a friend of yours,[N] I shall"
683,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,have occasion to treat with much freedom. I have heard of his
684,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,virtues. I know he has many virtues; God forbid I should ever seek
685,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"to lessen them, or wish them to be found insincere. I hope they are"
686,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"sincere, and that they will increase in number and merit every day."
687,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,To his virtues I shall do justice; but I must also do justice to his
688,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"faults, at least to those faults which are public, and which, for"
689,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the sake of truth and of mankind, ought not to be concealed or"
690,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,disguised. Personal reflections will be carefully avoided; I hope I
691,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"am in no danger of falling into them, for I bear no personal"
692,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,animosity against any man whatsoever: sometimes I may perhaps be
693,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,keen; but I trust I shall never depart from the Christian and
694,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,philosophic character.
695,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
696,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""A scheme like this of mine cannot be popular, far less can it be"
697,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,lucrative. It will raise me enemies; it will expose me to the
698,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,scrutiny of the most rigid criticism; it will make me be considered
699,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"by many as a sullen and illiberal bigot. I trust, however, in"
700,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Providence, and in the goodness of my cause, that my attempts in"
701,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"behalf of truth shall not be altogether ineffectual, and that my"
702,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,labours shall be attended with some utility to my fellow-creatures.
703,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"This, in my estimation, will do much more than counterbalance all"
704,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,the inconveniences I have any reason to apprehend. I have already
705,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,fallen on evil tongues (as Milton says) on account of this intended
706,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"publication. It has been reported, that I had written a most"
707,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"scurrilous paper against Mr. Hume, and was preparing to publish it"
708,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"when a friend of mine interposed, and, with very great difficulty,"
709,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"prevailed on me to suppress it, because he knew it would hurt or"
710,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,ruin my character. Such is the treatment I have to expect from one
711,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,set of people. I was so provoked when I first heard this calumny
712,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,that I deliberated whether I should not throw my papers into the
713,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"fire, with a _Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur_: but I rejected"
714,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"that thought; for so many persons have told me, that it was my"
715,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"_duty_ to publish these papers, that I almost began to think so"
716,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,myself. Many have urged me to publish them; none ever dissuaded me.
717,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"The gentleman, named in the report, read the essay, and returned it"
718,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,with the highest commendations; but I do not recollect that he ever
719,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,spoke a syllable about publishing or suppressing it. But I have
720,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"certainly tired you with so long a detail, about so trifling a"
721,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"matter as my works. However, I thought it necessary to say something"
722,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"by way of apology for them, for I find that your good opinion is of"
723,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"too much consequence to my peace, to suffer me to neglect any"
724,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"opportunity of cultivating it."""
725,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
726,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"The _Essay on Truth_ being now finished, our author was desirous of"
727,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"selling the MS. to some bookseller, in order that he might avoid all"
728,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"risk to himself in the publication, and intrusted the care of this"
729,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"matter to Sir William Forbes and Mr. Arbuthnot. His two friends,"
730,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"however, having applied to the bookseller, whom they imagined the most"
731,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"proper person to publish the work, were vexed by his positive refusal to"
732,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"purchase it, although he had no objection to print it on Beattie's"
733,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,account. In this difficulty they generously resolved to become
734,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"themselves the purchasers of the first edition. ""I therefore,"" says Sir"
735,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"William Forbes, ""wrote to him [Beattie] (nothing surely but the truth,"
736,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"although, I confess, not the whole truth,) that the manuscript was sold"
737,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"for fifty guineas, which I remitted to him by a bank bill; and I added,"
738,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"that we had stipulated with the bookseller who was to print the book,"
739,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"that we should be partners in the publication."""
740,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
741,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"At length in May, 1770, the _Essay on Truth_ was given to the world. As"
742,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"it had been seen in manuscript by several eminent literary characters,"
743,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,and as it was understood to be a direct attack on the philosophy of Hume
744,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"(who was then in the height of his popularity,) its appearance excited"
745,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"immediate notice. It has been said, that on its publication, Hume spoke"
746,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"of Beattie with great bitterness, complaining (and I am forced to allow"
747,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,that there was some cause for the complaint) that he had not used him
748,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,like a gentleman: it has even been asserted that he could not endure the
749,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,name of our author to be mentioned in his presence. I suspect that in
750,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,all this there is great exaggeration. The placid temper of Hume was not
751,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,likely to be much ruffled by any thing that might be written against his
752,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,system; his friends and admirers were probably more disturbed by the
753,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,attack than the philosopher himself. In less than four years five large
754,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"editions of the _Essay_ were circulated, and translations of it were"
755,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,made into French and other foreign languages.
756,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
757,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,From the rugged paths of philosophy Beattie turned once more into the
758,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"flowery walks of poesy. In 1771, the First Book of _The Minstrel_ was"
759,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,published without the author's name. Its success was complete. The voice
760,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,of every critic was loud in its praise; and before the Second Book
761,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"appeared (in 1774), four editions of the First had been dispersed"
762,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,throughout the kingdom. The following elegant and touching encomium was
763,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"passed upon the poem by Lord Lyttelton, in a letter to Mrs. Montagu, who"
764,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,had put the First Book into the hands of that virtuous nobleman:
765,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
766,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""Hill Street, 8th March, 1771."
767,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
768,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""I read your 'Minstrel' last night, with as much rapture as poetry,"
769,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"in her noblest, sweetest charms, ever raised in my soul. It seemed"
770,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"to me that my once most beloved minstrel, Thomson, was come down"
771,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"from heaven, refined by the converse of purer spirits than those he"
772,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"lived with here, to let me hear him sing again the beauties of"
773,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"nature, and the finest feelings of virtue, not with human, but with"
774,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,angelic strains! I beg you to express my gratitude to the poet for
775,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the pleasure he has given me."""
776,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
777,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Of the same date with the preceding letter, Beattie received one from"
778,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Gray, containing many minute remarks on his poem. As it consists almost"
779,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"entirely of verbal criticism, it scarcely admits of quotation: a single"
780,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,short extract may however be given from it:
781,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
782,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""St. 11. _O, how canst thou renounce_,[O] &c. But this, of all others,"
783,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,is my favourite stanza. It is true poetry; it is inspiration; only (to
784,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,show it is mortal) there is one blemish; the word _garniture_ suggesting
785,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"an idea of dress, and, what is worse, of French dress."""
786,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
787,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"When the poem was reprinted, one or two slight alterations were made in"
788,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,deference to the opinion of Gray.
789,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
790,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"In a letter to the Dowager Lady Forbes, 12th October, 1772, our author"
791,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,confesses that in the character of Edwin he meant to paint himself:
792,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
793,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""From the questions your Ladyship is pleased to propose in the"
794,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"conclusion of your letter, as well as from some things I have had the"
795,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"honour to hear you advance in conversation, I find you are willing to"
796,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"suppose that, in Edwin, I have given only a picture of myself, as I was"
797,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,in my younger days. I confess the supposition is not groundless. I have
798,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"made him take pleasure in the scenes in which I took pleasure, and"
799,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"entertain sentiments similar to those of which, even in my early youth,"
800,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"I had repeated experience. The scenery of a mountainous country, the"
801,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"ocean, the sky, thoughtfulness and retirement, and sometimes melancholy"
802,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"objects and ideas, had charms in my eyes, even when I was a schoolboy:"
803,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"and at a time when I was so far from being able to express, that I did"
804,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"not understand my own feelings, or perceive the tendency of such"
805,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"pursuits and amusements; and as to poetry and music, before I was ten"
806,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"years old I could play a little on the violin, and was as much master of"
807,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Homer and Virgil as Pope's and Dryden's translations could make me."""
808,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
809,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,The intense thought which Beattie had devoted to the composition of the
810,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"_Essay on Truth_ having materially injured his health, he was advised by"
811,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,his physicians to try the remedy of change of scene. He accordingly set
812,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"out on a journey to London, and arrived there in the beginning of"
813,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"autumn, 1771. He was no longer the obscure individual who had visited it"
814,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"in 1763;[P] he was now the triumphant adversary of scepticism, and the"
815,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,author of the admired _Minstrel_; a man whom the most distinguished
816,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,characters in the literary and fashionable world were prepared to treat
817,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"with attention and respect. Among several letters of introduction, which"
818,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"he carried with him, was one from Dr. Gregory, of Edinburgh, to Mrs."
819,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Montagu. At the splendid and hospitable mansion of this celebrated lady,"
820,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Beattie became acquainted with various persons, both male and female,"
821,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,who were then the chief ornaments of London society; and he used to
822,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"dwell with delight on the recollections of her more private parties,"
823,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"made up of Lord Lyttelton, Mrs. Carter, and a few others, who spent"
824,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"their evenings in the most unreserved conversation on literary, moral,"
825,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"or religious subjects. From this time, Mrs. Montagu continued to be one"
826,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,of his firmest friends; and their epistolary correspondence closed only
827,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"with her life. The politeness and kindness of Hawkesworth, Armstrong,"
828,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Garrick, and Johnson, also contributed much to render pleasant his visit"
829,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,to the metropolis. Concerning the last illustrious man he writes thus:
830,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""Johnson has been greatly misrepresented. I have passed several entire"
831,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"days with him, and found him extremely agreeable. The compliments he"
832,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,pays to my writings are so high that I have not the face to mention
833,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"them."" In December Beattie had returned to Aberdeen."
834,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
835,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"In 1772, his mother died, at the advanced age of fourscore, at the house"
836,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"of her affectionate son David, in the neighbourhood of Laurencekirk."
837,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
838,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Towards the end of April, 1773, Beattie, accompanied by his wife, set"
839,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,out again for London. This journey was undertaken partly for the sake of
840,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,his health and partly with a view to another object--the bettering of
841,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,his circumstances. The emolument which he had derived from his writings
842,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,bore unfortunately no proportion to the fame he had acquired; and the
843,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,small income arising from his professorship afforded him the only means
844,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"for supporting his family. During his former visit to the capital, in"
845,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"1771, his English friends had been very desirous to procure for him some"
846,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,permanent provision; and it was well known that his Majesty had
847,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"expressed approbation of his writings, and had even declared his"
848,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,intention of conferring some reward on the man who had laboured so
849,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,successfully to advance the interests of religion. With several
850,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,important letters of introduction--one addressed to the Earl of
851,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Dartmouth--he now arrived in London, and was cordially welcomed by Mrs."
852,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Montagu, and his other friends. His reception by Lord Dartmouth was kind"
853,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"and courteous: soon after which, being summoned to wait on Lord North,"
854,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,he was told by that minister that an early opportunity should be taken
855,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,to inform his Majesty of his arrival.
856,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
857,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,By some of his friends it had been suggested that Beattie should take
858,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"orders, and enter the English church; but this mode of improving his"
859,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"fortunes he very properly rejected.[Q] At last, by the advice of the"
860,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Archbishop of York, a memorial was drawn up ""expressing his services,"
861,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"his wants, and his wishes;"" which, having been transmitted to Lord"
862,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Dartmouth, was by him laid before the King, who, on that occasion, spoke"
863,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"of Beattie and his writings with high approbation, and signified a"
864,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,desire to see him.
865,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
866,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,Meantime the number of our author's acquaintances in the metropolis
867,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"increased daily, and his society was eagerly courted by a long list of"
868,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,illustrious names. He now became personally known to a distinguished
869,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"churchman, with whom, during the preceding year he had held some"
870,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"correspondence by letter--Dr. Porteus, then Rector of Lambeth, and"
871,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,finally Bishop of London; and the friendship which took place between
872,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,them was sincere and lasting.
873,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
874,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"At the first levee, Beattie was presented by Lord Dartmouth to his"
875,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Majesty, who for several minutes talked to him concerning his _Essay on"
876,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,Truth_ in the most condescending and affable manner.
877,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
878,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Soon after this, the University of Oxford, at the installation of Lord"
879,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"North as its Chancellor, conferred on our author a very flattering mark"
880,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"of distinction, an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws."
881,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
882,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"At length the object of his wishes was attained. On the 20th of August,"
883,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"he received an official letter from the secretary of Lord North,"
884,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,informing him that the king had been pleased to allow him a pension of
885,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"two hundred pounds a year. Of the private interview, with which, a few"
886,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"days after he was honoured by their majesties, he has left the following"
887,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,account in his Diary:
888,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
889,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""Tuesday, 24th August, set out for Dr. Majendie's at Kew-Green. The"
890,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Doctor told me that he had not seen the King yesterday, but had left a"
891,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"note in writing, to intimate that I was to be at his house to-day; and"
892,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"that one of the King's pages had come to him this morning, to say 'that"
893,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"his Majesty would see me a little after twelve.' At twelve, the Doctor"
894,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"and I went to the King's house, at Kew. We had been only a few minutes"
895,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"in the hall, when the King and Queen came in from an airing; and, as"
896,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"they passed through the hall, the King called to me by name, and asked"
897,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"how long it was since I came from town. I answered, about an hour. 'I"
898,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"shall see you,' says he, 'in a little.' The Doctor and I waited a"
899,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"considerable time (for the King was busy), and then we were called into"
900,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"a large room, furnished as a library, where the King was walking about,"
901,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,and the Queen sitting in a chair. We were received in the most gracious
902,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,manner possible by both their Majesties. I had the honour of a
903,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,conversation with them (nobody else being present but Dr. Majendie) for
904,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"upwards of an hour, on a great variety of topics; in which both the King"
905,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"and Queen joined, with a degree of cheerfulness, affability, and ease,"
906,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"that was to me surprising, and soon dissipated the embarrassment which I"
907,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"felt at the beginning of the conference. They both complimented me, in"
908,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the highest terms, on my 'Essay,' which, they said, was a book they"
909,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"always kept by them; and the King said he had one copy of it at Kew, and"
910,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"another in town, and immediately went and took it down from a shelf. I"
911,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"found it was the second edition. 'I never stole a book but one,' said"
912,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"his Majesty, 'and that was yours (speaking to me); I stole it from the"
913,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Queen, to give it to Lord Hertford to read.' He had heard that the sale"
914,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"of Hume's 'Essays' had failed, since my book was published; and I told"
915,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"him what Mr. Strahan had told me, in regard to that matter. He had even"
916,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"heard of my being in Edinburgh last summer, and how Mr. Hume was"
917,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,offended on the score of my book. He asked many questions about the
918,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"second part of the 'Essay,' and when it would be ready for the press. I"
919,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"gave him, in a short speech, an account of the plan of it; and said, my"
920,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"health was so precarious, I could not tell when it might be ready, as I"
921,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"had many books to consult before I could finish it; but, that if my"
922,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"health were good, I thought I might bring it to a conclusion in two or"
923,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"three years. He asked, how long I had been in composing my Essay?"
924,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"praised the caution with which it was written; and said, he did not"
925,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,wonder that it had employed me five or six years. He asked about my
926,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"poems. I said, there was only one poem of my own on which I set any"
927,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"value (meaning the 'Minstrel,') and that it was first published about"
928,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the same time with the 'Essay.' My other poems, I said, were incorrect,"
929,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"being but juvenile pieces, and of little consequence, even in my own"
930,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,opinion. We had much conversation on moral subjects; from which both
931,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,their Majesties let it appear that they were warm friends to
932,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Christianity; and so little inclined to infidelity, that they could"
933,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"hardly believe that any thinking man could really be an atheist, unless"
934,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,he could bring himself to believe that he made himself; a thought which
935,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,pleased the King exceedingly; and he repeated it several times to the
936,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Queen. He asked, whether any thing had been written against me. I spoke"
937,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"of the late pamphlet, of which I gave an account, telling him, that I"
938,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"never had met with any man who had read it, except one Quaker. This"
939,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"brought on some discourse about the Quakers, whose moderation and mild"
940,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,behaviour the King and Queen commended. I was asked many questions about
941,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,the Scots universities; the revenues of the Scots clergy; their mode of
942,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,praying and preaching; the medical college of Edinburgh; Dr. Gregory
943,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"(of whom I gave a particular character), and Dr. Cullen; the length of"
944,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"our vacation at Aberdeen, and the closeness of our attendance during the"
945,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,winter; the number of students that attend my lectures; my mode of
946,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"lecturing, whether from notes, or completely written lectures; about Mr."
947,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Hume, and Dr. Robertson, and Lord Kinnoull, and the Archbishop of York,"
948,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"&c. &c. &c. His Majesty asked what I thought of my new acquaintance,"
949,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,Lord Dartmouth? I said there was something in his air and manner which I
950,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"thought not only agreeable, but enchanting, and that he seemed to me to"
951,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,be one of the best of men; a sentiment in which both their Majesties
952,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"heartily joined. 'They say that Lord Dartmouth is an enthusiast,' said"
953,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the King, 'but surely he says nothing on the subject of religion, but"
954,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"what every Christian may, and ought to say.' He asked, whether I did not"
955,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,think the English language on the decline at present? I answered in the
956,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"affirmative; and the King agreed, and named the 'Spectator' as one of"
957,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,the best standards of the language. When I told him that the Scots
958,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"clergy sometimes prayed a quarter, or even half an hour at a time, he"
959,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"asked whether that did not lead them into repetitions? I said, it often"
960,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"did. 'That,' said he, 'I don't like in prayers; and excellent as our"
961,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"liturgy is, I think it somewhat faulty in that respect.' 'Your majesty"
962,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"knows,' said I, 'that three services are joined in one in the ordinary"
963,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"church service, which is one cause of those repetitions.' 'True,' he"
964,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"replied, 'and that circumstance also makes the service too long.' From"
965,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,this he took occasion to speak of the composition of the church liturgy;
966,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"on which he very justly bestowed the highest commendation. 'Observe,'"
967,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"his Majesty said, 'how flat those occasional prayers are, that are now"
968,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"composed, in comparison with the old ones.' When I mentioned the"
969,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"smallness of the church livings in Scotland, he said, 'he wondered how"
970,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,men of liberal education would choose to become clergymen there;' and
971,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"asked, 'whether in the remote parts of the country, the clergy, in"
972,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"general were not very ignorant?' I answered, 'No, for that education was"
973,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"very cheap in Scotland, and that the clergy, in general, were men of"
974,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"good sense, and competent learning.' He asked whether we had any good"
975,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"preachers at Aberdeen? I said, yes, and named Campbell and Gerard, with"
976,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"whose names, however, I did not find that he was acquainted. Dr."
977,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,Majendie mentioned Dr. Oswald's 'Appeal' with commendation; I praised it
978,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"too and the queen took down the name, with a view to send for it. I was"
979,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"asked, whether I knew Dr. Oswald? I answered, I did not; and said, that"
980,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,my book was published before I read his; that Dr. O. was well known to
981,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Lord Kinnoull, who had often proposed to make us acquainted. We"
982,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"discussed a great many other topics; for the conversation, as before"
983,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"observed, lasted for upwards of an hour, without any intermission. The"
984,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,Queen bore a large share in it. Both the King and her Majesty showed a
985,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"great deal of good sense, acuteness, and knowledge, as well as of good"
986,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,nature and affability. At last the king took out his watch (for it was
987,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"now almost three o'clock, his hour of dinner), which Dr. Majendie and I"
988,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"took as a signal to withdraw. We accordingly bowed to their Majesties,"
989,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"and I addressed the King in these words: 'I hope, Sir, your Majesty will"
990,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"pardon me, if I take this opportunity to return you my humble and most"
991,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"grateful acknowledgments, for the honour you have been pleased to confer"
992,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"upon me.' He immediately answered, 'I think I could do no less for a man"
993,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,who has done so much service to the cause of Christianity. I shall
994,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,always be glad of an opportunity to show the good opinion I have of
995,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"you.' The Queen sate all the while, and the King stood, sometimes"
996,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,walking about a little. Her Majesty speaks the English language with
997,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"surprising elegance, and little or nothing of a foreign accent. There is"
998,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,something wonderfully captivating in her manner; so that if she were
999,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"only of the rank of a private gentlewoman, one could not help taking"
1000,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"notice of her, as one of the most agreeable women in the world. Her face"
1001,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,is much more pleasing than any of her pictures; and in the expression of
1002,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"her eyes, and in her smile, there is something peculiarly engaging."
1003,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"When the Doctor and I came out, 'Pray,' said I, 'how did I behave? Tell"
1004,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"me honestly, for I am not accustomed to conversations of this kind.'"
1005,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"'Why, perfectly well,' answered he, 'and just as you ought to do.' 'Are"
1006,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"you sure of that?' said I. 'As sure,' he replied, 'as of my own"
1007,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"existence: and you may be assured of it too, when I tell you, that if"
1008,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,there had been any thing in your manner or conversation which was not
1009,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"perfectly agreeable, your conference would have been at an end in eight"
1010,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"or ten minutes at most.' The Doctor afterwards told me, that it was a"
1011,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"most uncommon thing for a private man, and a commoner, to be honoured"
1012,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"with so long an audience. I dined with Dr. and Mrs. Majendie, and their"
1013,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"family, and returned to town in the evening, very much pleased with the"
1014,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"occurrences of the day."""
1015,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
1016,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"At this time, Sir Joshua Reynolds, having requested Beattie to sit for"
1017,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"his picture, produced a likeness of him, which is generally regarded as"
1018,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,one of the finest works of that admirable artist. He is represented in
1019,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"his Oxford gown of Doctor of Laws, with his famous Essay under his arm;"
1020,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"while beside him is Truth, habited as an Angel, holding in one hand a"
1021,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"pair of scales, and with the other thrusting down three frightful"
1022,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"figures, emblematic of Prejudice, Scepticism, and Folly.[R] Of this"
1023,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"picture Sir Joshua made a present to Beattie, who set a due value on so"
1024,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"noble a composition, and preserved it with the utmost care."
1025,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
1026,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"After an absence of a little more than five months, he returned to"
1027,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,Aberdeen.
1028,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
1029,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,A striking proof how highly the character and talents of Beattie were
1030,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"appreciated, even by those to whom he was personally unknown, occurred"
1031,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"in October of this year (1773), when the chair of Moral Philosophy in"
1032,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"the University of Edinburgh was offered to him by the electors, the"
1033,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"magistrates of the city. He, however, declined accepting it, ""Though my"
1034,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"fortune"" (he writes to Sir William Forbes, on the subject) ""were as"
1035,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"narrow now as it lately was, I should still incline rather to remain in"
1036,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"quiet where I am, than, by becoming a member of the University of"
1037,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Edinburgh, to place myself within the reach of those (few as they are)"
1038,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,who have been pleased to let the world know that they do not wish me
1039,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"well."" He alludes to the enemies whom his _Essay on Truth_ had raised"
1040,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,up.
1041,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
1042,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"The Second Book of _The Minstrel_, together with a new and corrected"
1043,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"edition of the First, appeared in 1774, the author's name being now"
1044,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"added. The poem, thus enlarged, suffered no diminution of its"
1045,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,popularity.
1046,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
1047,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"The following year, Beattie and his wife spent several weeks in London,"
1048,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"residing during the chief part of the time with Dr. Porteus, one of his"
1049,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"kindest and most zealous friends. On this occasion, having shown himself"
1050,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"at court, he was immediately recognized by the King, who spoke to him"
1051,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"very graciously, and made several inquiries concerning his studies."
1052,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
1053,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"To a new and improved edition in quarto, of the _Essay on Truth_,"
1054,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"printed by subscription,[S] in 1776, our author appended three other"
1055,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Essays: _On Poetry and Music, as they affect the Mind_, _On Laughter and"
1056,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Ludicrous Composition_, and _On the Utility of Classical Learning_. In"
1057,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"1777,[T] he gave to the press a new edition of _The Minstrel_, to which"
1058,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,he added a few of his minor poems: this volume (he says in the preface)
1059,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"contains ""all the verses of which I am willing to be considered as the"
1060,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"author."" In 1778,[U] he printed for private circulation a _Letter to Dr."
1061,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Blair, on the improvement of Psalmody in Scotland_. In 1779, he"
1062,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"published, for the use of the young men who attended his Lectures, a"
1063,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"_List of Scotticisms_, to the amount of about two hundred. And in 1780,"
1064,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,he contributed some thoughts _On Dreaming_ to the well known periodical
1065,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"paper, _The Mirror_."
1066,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
1067,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,The following portion of a letter from Dr. Johnson to Beattie shows how
1068,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,sincerely our author was esteemed by the great moralist:
1069,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
1070,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""Bolt Court, Fleet Street, 21st August, 1780."
1071,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
1072,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""More years than I have any delight to reckon have past since you"
1073,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"and I saw one another. Of this, however, there is no reason for"
1074,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"making any reprehensory complaint, _sic fata ferunt_: but, methinks,"
1075,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,there might pass some small interchange of regard between us. If you
1076,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"say that I ought to have written, I now write; and I write to tell"
1077,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"you, that I have much kindness for you and Mrs. Beattie, and that I"
1078,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"wish your health better, and your life long. Try change of air, and"
1079,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,come a few degrees southward; a softer climate may do you both good.
1080,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"Winter is coming on, and London will be warmer, and gayer, and"
1081,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"busier, and more fertile of amusement than Aberdeen."""
1082,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,
1083,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"In 1781, Beattie made another journey to London, taking with him his"
1084,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"eldest son, James Hay Beattie.[V] While there, we find him writing thus"

1089,BY THE REV. ALEXANDER DYCE.,"""I have been visiting all my friends again and again, and found them"

1597,[O],"the other from Dr. Thomas, Bishop of Winchester, of a living in Hants,"
1598,[O],valued at £500 a year--neither of which he would accept. In the letter
1599,[O],"wherein he declines the second noble offer, he thus expresses himself:"
1600,[O],
1601,[O],"""I wrote the 'Essays on Truth' with the certain prospect of raising many"
1602,[O],"enemies, with very faint hopes of attracting the public attention, and"
1603,[O],"without any views of advancing my fortune. I published it, however,"
1604,[O],"because I thought it might probably do a little good, by bringing to"
1605,[O],"nought, or, at least, lessening the reputation of that wretched system"
1606,[O],"of sceptical philosophy, which had made a most alarming progress, and"
1607,[O],done incredible mischief to this country. My enemies have been at great
1608,[O],"pains to represent my views, in that publication, as very different: and"
1609,[O],"that my principal, or only motive was to make a book, and, if possible,"
1610,[O],"to raise myself higher in the world. So that, if I were now to accept"
1611,[O],"preferment in the church, I should be apprehensive that I might"
1612,[O],"strengthen the hands of the gainsayer, and give the world some ground to"
1613,[O],"believe that my love of truth was not quite so ardent, or so pure, as I"
1614,[O],had pretended.
1615,[O],
1616,[O],"""Besides, might it not have the appearance of levity and insincerity,"
1617,[O],"and, by some, be construed into a want of principle, if I were, at these"
1618,[O],"years (for I am now thirty-eight), to make such an important change in"
1619,[O],"my way of life, and to quit, with no other _apparent_ motive than that"
1620,[O],"of bettering my circumstances, that church of which I have hitherto been"
1621,[O],"a member? If my book has any tendency to do good, as I flatter myself it"
1622,[O],"has, I would not, for the wealth of the Indies, do any thing to"
1623,[O],"counteract that tendency; and I am afraid that tendency might, in some"
1624,[O],measure be counteracted (at least in this country) if I were to give the
1625,[O],"adversary the least ground to charge me with inconsistency. It is true,"
1626,[O],that the force of my reasonings cannot be _really_ affected by my
1627,[O],"character; truth is truth, whoever be the speaker; but even truth itself"
1628,[O],"becomes less respectable, when spoken, or supposed to be spoken, by"
1629,[O],insincere lips.
1630,[O],
1631,[O],"""It has also been hinted to me, by several persons of very sound"
1632,[O],"judgment, that what I have written, or may hereafter write in favour of"
1633,[O],"religion, has a chance of being more attended to, if I continue a"
1634,[O],"layman, than if I were to become a clergyman. Nor am I without"
1635,[O],"apprehensions (though some of my friends think them ill founded) that,"
1636,[O],"from entering so late in life, and from so remote a province, into the"
1637,[O],"Church of England, some degree of ungracefulness, particularly in"
1638,[O],"pronunciation, might adhere to my performances in public, sufficient to"
1639,[O],"render them less pleasing, and consequently less useful."""
1640,[O],
1641,[O],[R] So Beattie names the figures in one of his letters; but Sir William
1642,[O],"Forbes tells us they are supposed to mean Sophistry, Scepticism, and"
1643,[O],Infidelity. The worthy Baronet proceeds to observe:
1644,[O],
1645,[O],"""Because one of these was a lean figure and the [an] other a fat one,"
1646,[O],people of lively imaginations pleased themselves with finding in them
1647,[O],"the portraits of Voltaire and Mr. Hume. But Sir Joshua, I have reason to"
1648,[O],"believe, had no such thought when he painted those figures."""

1651,[O],"his _Life of Beattie_, for in vol. ii. p. 42, octavo ed., we find the"
1652,[O],"great painter writing to our poet as follows, in February, 1774:"
1653,[O],
1654,[O],"""Mr. Hume has heard from somebody that he is introduced in the picture,"
1655,[O],"not much to his credit; there is only a figure, covering his face with"
1656,[O],"his hands, which they may call Hume or any body else; _it is true it has"
1657,[O],"a tolerable broad back. As for Voltaire, I intended he should be one of"
1658,[O],"the group._"""

1664,[O],"whether government would ever make any provision for him, his friends"
1665,[O],"there set on foot a subscription for this work. ""It was a thing,"" says"

1669,[O],"never meant to be made public, nor put into the hands of booksellers,"
1670,[O],"nor carried on by solicitation, but was to be considered as a"
1671,[O],"_voluntary_ mark of the approbation of some persons of rank and fortune,"

4523,A FABLE.,"Some new phenomenon to raise,"
4524,A FABLE.,"Which, bursting on his frighted gaze,"

7095,TITYRUS.,"[1] It has been observed by some critics, who have treated of pastoral"
7096,TITYRUS.,"poetry, that, in every poem of this kind, it is proper, that the scene"
7097,TITYRUS.,"or landscape, connected with the little plot or fable on which the poem"
7098,TITYRUS.,"is founded, be delineated with at least as much accuracy, as is"
7099,TITYRUS.,sufficient to render the description particular and picturesque. How far
7100,TITYRUS.,Virgil has thought fit to attend to such a rule may appear from the
7101,TITYRUS.,remarks which the translator has subjoined to every Pastoral.
7102,TITYRUS.,
7103,TITYRUS.,The scene of the first pastoral is pictured out with great accuracy. The
7104,TITYRUS.,shepherds Meliboeus and Tityrus are represented as conversing together
7105,TITYRUS.,beneath a spreading beech tree. Flocks and herds are feeding hard by. At
7106,TITYRUS.,"a little distance we behold, on the one hand a great rock, and on the"
7107,TITYRUS.,other a fence of flowering willows. The prospect as it widens is
7108,TITYRUS.,"diversified with groves, and streams, and some tall trees, particularly"
7109,TITYRUS.,"elms. Beyond all these appear marshy grounds, and rocky hills. The"
7110,TITYRUS.,"ragged and drooping flock of the unfortunate shepherd, particularly the"
7111,TITYRUS.,"she goat which he leads along, are no inconsiderable figures in this"
7112,TITYRUS.,"picture.--The time is the evening of a summer day, a little before"
7113,TITYRUS.,"sunset. See the Original, v. 1, 5, 9, 52, 54, 67, 69, 81, &c."
7114,TITYRUS.,
7115,TITYRUS.,This Pastoral is said to have been written on the following occasion.
7116,TITYRUS.,"Augustus, in order to reward the services of his veterans, by means of"
7117,TITYRUS.,"whom he had established himself in the Roman empire, distributed among"
7118,TITYRUS.,them the lands that lay contiguous to Mantua and Cremona. To make way
7119,TITYRUS.,"for these intruders, the rightful owners, of whom Virgil was one, were"
7120,TITYRUS.,"turned out. But our poet, by the intercession of Mecænas, was reinstated"
7121,TITYRUS.,"in his possessions. Meliboeus here personates one of the unhappy exiles,"
7122,TITYRUS.,and Virgil is represented under the character of Tityrus.
7123,TITYRUS.,
7124,TITYRUS.,"[2] The refinements of Taubmannus, De La Cerda, and others, who will"
7125,TITYRUS.,"have Amaryllis to signify Rome, and Galatea to signify Mantua, have"
7126,TITYRUS.,"perplexed this passage not a little: if the literal meaning be admitted,"
7127,TITYRUS.,the whole becomes obvious and natural.

7148,ALEXIS.,"But am I doom'd, unpitying boy, to die?"

7162,ALEXIS.,"O beauteous boy, on thy celestial bloom;"
7163,ALEXIS.,"The sable violet[2] yields a precious dye,"
7164,ALEXIS.,While useless on the field the withering lilies lie.
7165,ALEXIS.,"Ah, cruel boy! my love is all in vain,"
7166,ALEXIS.,No thoughts of thine regard thy wretched swain.
7167,ALEXIS.,"How rich my flock thou carest not to know,"
7168,ALEXIS.,Nor how my pails with generous milk o'erflow.
7169,ALEXIS.,"With bleat of thousand lambs my hills resound,"
7170,ALEXIS.,And all the year my milky stores abound.
7171,ALEXIS.,"Not Amphion's lays were sweeter than my song,"
7172,ALEXIS.,Those lays that led the listening herds along.
7173,ALEXIS.,"And if the face be true I lately view'd,"
7174,ALEXIS.,"Where calm and clear th' uncurling ocean stood,"
7175,ALEXIS.,"I lack not beauty, nor could'st thou deny,"
7176,ALEXIS.,That even with Daphnis I may dare to vie.
7177,ALEXIS.,O deign at last amid these lonely fields
7178,ALEXIS.,To taste the pleasures which the country yields;
7179,ALEXIS.,"With me to dwell in cottages resign'd,"
7180,ALEXIS.,"To roam the woods, to shoot the bounding hind;"
7181,ALEXIS.,With me the weanling kids from home to guide
7182,ALEXIS.,To the green mallows on the mountain side;
7183,ALEXIS.,"With me in echoing groves the song to raise,"
7184,ALEXIS.,And emulate even Pan's celestial lays.
7185,ALEXIS.,"Pan taught the jointed reed its tuneful strain,"
7186,ALEXIS.,"Pan guards the tender flock, and shepherd swain."
7187,ALEXIS.,"Nor grudge, Alexis, that the rural pipe"
7188,ALEXIS.,So oft has stain'd the roses of thy lip:
7189,ALEXIS.,How did Amyntas strive thy skill to gain!
7190,ALEXIS.,How grieve at last to find his labour vain!
7191,ALEXIS.,"Of seven unequal reeds a pipe I have,"
7192,ALEXIS.,The precious gift which good Damoetas gave;
7193,ALEXIS.,"""Take this,"" the dying shepherd said, ""for none"
7194,ALEXIS.,"Inherits all my skill but thou alone."""
7195,ALEXIS.,"He said; Amyntas murmurs at my praise,"
7196,ALEXIS.,And with an envious eye the gift surveys.
7197,ALEXIS.,"Besides, as presents for my soul's delight,"
7198,ALEXIS.,"Two beauteous kids I keep bestreak'd with white,"
7199,ALEXIS.,"Nourish'd with care, nor purchas'd without pain;"
7200,ALEXIS.,An ewe's full udder twice a day they drain.
7201,ALEXIS.,These to obtain oft Thestylis hath tried
7202,ALEXIS.,"Each winning art, while I her suit denied;"
7203,ALEXIS.,"But I at last shall yield what she requests,"
7204,ALEXIS.,Since thy relentless pride my gifts detests.
7205,ALEXIS.,"Come, beauteous boy, and bless my rural bowers,"
7206,ALEXIS.,For thee the nymphs collect the choicest flowers;
7207,ALEXIS.,Fair Nais culls amid the bloomy dale
7208,ALEXIS.,"The drooping poppy, and the violet pale,"
7209,ALEXIS.,"To marygolds the hyacinth applies,"
7210,ALEXIS.,Shading the glossy with the tawny dyes:
7211,ALEXIS.,"Narcissus' flower with daffodil entwin'd,"
7212,ALEXIS.,And cassia's breathing sweets to these are join'd.
7213,ALEXIS.,"With every bloom that paints the vernal grove,"
7214,ALEXIS.,And all to form a garland for my love.
7215,ALEXIS.,Myself with sweetest fruits will crown thy feast;
7216,ALEXIS.,"The luscious peach shall gratify thy taste,"
7217,ALEXIS.,"And, chestnut brown (once high in my regard,"
7218,ALEXIS.,For Amaryllis this to all preferr'd;
7219,ALEXIS.,"But if the blushing plum thy choice thou make,"
7220,ALEXIS.,The plum shall more be valued for thy sake.)
7221,ALEXIS.,The myrtle wreath'd with laurel shall exhale
7222,ALEXIS.,A blended fragrance to delight thy smell.
7223,ALEXIS.,"Ah Corydon! thou rustic, simple swain!"
7224,ALEXIS.,"Thyself, thy prayers, thy offers all are vain."
7225,ALEXIS.,"How few, compar'd with rich Iolas' store,"
7226,ALEXIS.,"Thy boasted gifts, and all thy wealth how poor!"
7227,ALEXIS.,"Wretch that I am! while thus I pine forlorn,"
7228,ALEXIS.,"And all the livelong day inactive mourn,"
7229,ALEXIS.,"The boars have laid my silver fountains waste,"
7230,ALEXIS.,My flowers are fading in the southern blast.--
7231,ALEXIS.,"Fly'st thou, ah foolish boy, the lonesome grove?"
7232,ALEXIS.,Yet gods for this have left the realms above.
7233,ALEXIS.,"Paris with scorn the pomp of Troy survey'd,"
7234,ALEXIS.,"And sought th' Idæan bowers and peaceful shade,"
7235,ALEXIS.,In her proud palaces let Pallas shine;
7236,ALEXIS.,"The lowly woods, and rural life be mine."
7237,ALEXIS.,The lioness all dreadful in her course
7238,ALEXIS.,"Pursues the wolf, and he with headlong force"
7239,ALEXIS.,"Flies at the wanton goat, that loves to climb"
7240,ALEXIS.,"The cliff's steep side, and crop the flowering thyme;"
7241,ALEXIS.,"Thee Corydon pursues, O beauteous boy:"
7242,ALEXIS.,Thus each is drawn along by some peculiar joy.
7243,ALEXIS.,Now evening soft comes on; and homeward now
7244,ALEXIS.,From field the weary oxen bear the plough.
7245,ALEXIS.,"The setting Sun now beams more mildly bright,"
7246,ALEXIS.,The shadows lengthening with the level light.
7247,ALEXIS.,While with love's flame my restless bosom glows.
7248,ALEXIS.,For love no interval of ease allows.
7249,ALEXIS.,Ah Corydon! to weak complaints a prey!
7250,ALEXIS.,What madness thus to waste the fleeting day!
7251,ALEXIS.,Be rous'd at length; thy half-prun'd vines demand
7252,ALEXIS.,The needful culture of thy curbing hand.
7253,ALEXIS.,"Haste, lingering swain, the flexile willows weave,"
7254,ALEXIS.,And with thy wonted care thy wants relieve.
7255,ALEXIS.,"Forget Alexis' unrelenting scorn,"
7256,ALEXIS.,Another love thy passion will return.
7257,ALEXIS.,
7258,ALEXIS.,
7259,ALEXIS.,[1] The chief excellency of this poem consists in its delicacy and
7260,ALEXIS.,simplicity. Corydon addresses his favourite in such a purity of
7261,ALEXIS.,sentiment as one would think might effectually discountenance the
7262,ALEXIS.,prepossessions which generally prevail against the subject of this
7263,ALEXIS.,eclogue. The nature of his affection may easily be ascertained from his
7264,ALEXIS.,ideas of the happiness which he hopes to enjoy in the company of his
7265,ALEXIS.,beloved Alexis.

7273,ALEXIS.,"Pericles, and Socrates: an affection wholly distinct from the infamous"
7274,ALEXIS.,attachments that prevailed among the licentious. The reader will find a
7275,ALEXIS.,full and satisfying account of this generous passion in Dr. Potter's
7276,ALEXIS.,"Antiquities of Greece, B. iv. chap. 9. Mons. Bayle, in his Dictionary at"

7741,POLLIO.,"ancient prophecy that might have fallen into his hands, and that he"
7742,POLLIO.,"afterwards inscribed it to his friend and patron Pollio, on occasion of"

8092,SILENUS.,"Her dogs the trembling sailors dragg'd, and slew."
8093,SILENUS.,"Of Philomela's feast why should I sing,[12]"

8529,ALPHESIBOEUS.,preserve the conceit on the words _puer_ and _mater_ in his version; as

8689,MOERIS.,[1] This and the first eclogue seem to have been written on the same
8690,MOERIS.,occasion. The time is a still evening. The landscape is described at the
8691,MOERIS.,97th line of this translation. On one side of the highway is an
8692,MOERIS.,"artificial arbour, where Lycidas invites Moeris to rest a little from"
8693,MOERIS.,the fatigue of his journey: and at a considerable distance appears a
8694,MOERIS.,"sepulchre by the way-side, where the ancient sepulchres were commonly"
8695,MOERIS.,erected.
8696,MOERIS.,
8697,MOERIS.,The critics with one voice seem to condemn this eclogue as unworthy of
8698,MOERIS.,its author; I know not for what good reason. The many beautiful lines
8699,MOERIS.,"scattered through it would, one might think, be no weak recommendation."
8700,MOERIS.,But it is by no means to be reckoned a loose collection of incoherent
8701,MOERIS.,"fragments; its principal parts are all strictly connected, and refer to"
8702,MOERIS.,"a certain end, and its allusions and images are wholly suited to"
8703,MOERIS.,"pastoral life. Its subject, though uncommon, is not improper; for what"
8704,MOERIS.,"is more natural, than that two shepherds, when occasionally mentioning"
8705,MOERIS.,"the good qualities of their absent friend, particularly his poetical"
8706,MOERIS.,"talents, should repeat such fragments of his songs as they recollected?"
8707,MOERIS.,
8708,MOERIS.,"[2] These lines, which Virgil has translated literally from Theocritus,"
8709,MOERIS.,may be supposed to be a fragment of a poem mentioned in the preceding
8710,MOERIS.,"verses; or, what is more likely, to be spoken by Lycidas to his servant;"
8711,MOERIS.,something similar to which may be seen Past. 5. v. 20. of this
8712,MOERIS.,"translation.--The original is here remarkably explicit, even to a degree"
8713,MOERIS.,of affectation. This the translator has endeavoured to imitate.

8752,GALLUS.,"All wept his fate, when to despair resign'd"
8753,GALLUS.,Beneath a desert-cliff he lay reclin'd.
8754,GALLUS.,"Lyceus' rocks were hung with many a tear,"

8756,GALLUS.,"Nor scorn, celestial bard, a poet's name;"
8757,GALLUS.,Renown'd Adonis by the lonely stream
8758,GALLUS.,"Tended his flock.--As thus he lay along,"
8759,GALLUS.,The swains and awkward neatherds round him throng.
8760,GALLUS.,Wet from the winter-mast Menalcas came.
8761,GALLUS.,"All ask, what beauty rais'd the fatal flame."
8762,GALLUS.,The god of verse vouchsafed to join the rest;
8763,GALLUS.,"He said, ""What phrensy thus torments thy breast?"
8764,GALLUS.,"While she, thy darling, thy Lycoris, scorns"
8765,GALLUS.,"Thy proffer'd love, and for another burns,"
8766,GALLUS.,"With whom o'er winter-wastes she wanders far,"
8767,GALLUS.,"'Midst camps, and clashing arms, and boisterous war."""
8768,GALLUS.,"Sylvanus came with rural garlands crown'd,"

8771,GALLUS.,His smiling cheeks with bright vermilion glow'd.
8772,GALLUS.,"""For ever wilt thou heave the bursting sigh?"
8773,GALLUS.,Is love regardful of the weeping eye?
8774,GALLUS.,"Love is not cloy'd with tears; alas, no more"

8776,GALLUS.,"Than goats with foliage, than the grassy plain"
8777,GALLUS.,"With silver rills and soft refreshing rain."""
8778,GALLUS.,Pan spoke; and thus the youth with grief opprest;
8779,GALLUS.,"""Arcadians, hear, O hear my last request;"
8780,GALLUS.,"O ye, to whom the sweetest lays belong,"
8781,GALLUS.,O let my sorrows on your hills be sung:
8782,GALLUS.,"If your soft flutes shall celebrate my woes,"
8783,GALLUS.,How will my bones in deepest peace repose!
8784,GALLUS.,"Ah had I been with you a country-swain,"
8785,GALLUS.,"And prun'd the vine, and fed the bleating train;"
8786,GALLUS.,"Had Phyllis, or some other rural fair,"
8787,GALLUS.,Or black Amyntas been my darling care;
8788,GALLUS.,(Beauteous though black; what lovelier flower is seen
8789,GALLUS.,Than the dark violet on the painted green?)
8790,GALLUS.,"These in the bower had yielded all their charms,"
8791,GALLUS.,And sunk with mutual raptures in my arms:
8792,GALLUS.,"Phyllis had crown'd my head with garlands gay,"
8793,GALLUS.,Amyntas sung the pleasing hours away.

8798,GALLUS.,"Banish'd by love o'er hostile lands I stray,"
8799,GALLUS.,And mingle in the battle's dread array;
8800,GALLUS.,"Whilst thou, relentless to my constant flame,"
8801,GALLUS.,(Ah could I disbelieve the voice of fame!)
8802,GALLUS.,"Far from thy home, unaided and forlorn,"
8803,GALLUS.,"Far from thy love, thy faithful love, art borne,"
8804,GALLUS.,"On the bleak Alps with chilling blast to pine,"

8808,GALLUS.,"""Hence let me hasten to some desert-grove,"

8810,GALLUS.,"I go, in some lone wilderness to suit"
8811,GALLUS.,Euboean lays to my Sicilian flute.
8812,GALLUS.,Better with beasts of prey to make abode
8813,GALLUS.,"In the deep cavern, or the darksome wood;"
8814,GALLUS.,"And carve on trees the story of my woe,"
8815,GALLUS.,"Which with the growing bark shall ever grow,"
8816,GALLUS.,"Meanwhile with woodland-nymphs, a lovely throng,"
8817,GALLUS.,The winding groves of Mænalus along
8818,GALLUS.,I roam at large; or chase the foaming boar;
8819,GALLUS.,"Or with sagacious hounds the wilds explore,"
8820,GALLUS.,Careless of cold. And now methinks I bound
8821,GALLUS.,"O'er rocks and cliffs, and hear the woods resound;"
8822,GALLUS.,And now with beating heart I seem to wing
8823,GALLUS.,The Cretan arrow from the Parthian string--
8824,GALLUS.,"As if I thus my phrensy could forego,"
8825,GALLUS.,As if love's god could melt at human woe.
8826,GALLUS.,Alas! nor nymphs nor heavenly songs delight--
8827,GALLUS.,"Farewell, ye groves! the groves no more invite."
8828,GALLUS.,"No pains, no miseries of man can move"
8829,GALLUS.,The unrelenting deity of love.
8830,GALLUS.,"To quench your thirst in Hebrus' frozen flood,"
8831,GALLUS.,To make the Scythian snows your drear abode;
8832,GALLUS.,"Or feed your flock on Ethiopian plains,"
8833,GALLUS.,"When Sirius' fiery constellation reigns,"
8834,GALLUS.,"(When deep-imbrown'd the languid herbage lies,"
8835,GALLUS.,And in the elm the vivid verdure dies)
8836,GALLUS.,Were all in vain. Love's unresisted sway
8837,GALLUS.,"Extends to all, and we must love obey."""
8838,GALLUS.,"'Tis done: ye Nine, here ends your poet's strain"
8839,GALLUS.,In pity sung to soothe his Gallus' pain.
8840,GALLUS.,While leaning on a flowery bank I twine
8841,GALLUS.,"The flexile osiers, and the basket join."
8842,GALLUS.,"Celestial Nine, your sacred influence bring,"
8843,GALLUS.,And soothe my Gallus' sorrows while I sing:
8844,GALLUS.,"Gallus, my much belov'd! for whom I feel"
8845,GALLUS.,The flame of purest friendship rising still:
8846,GALLUS.,"So by a brook the verdant alders rise,"
8847,GALLUS.,When fostering zephyrs fan the vernal skies.
8848,GALLUS.,"Let us begone: at eve, the shade annoys"
8849,GALLUS.,"With noxious damps, and hurts the singer's voice;"
8850,GALLUS.,"The juniper breathes bitter vapours round,"
8851,GALLUS.,"That kill the springing corn, and blast the ground."
8852,GALLUS.,"Homeward, my sated goats, now let us hie;"
8853,GALLUS.,Lo beamy Hesper gilds the western sky.
8854,GALLUS.,
8855,GALLUS.,
8856,GALLUS.,[1] The scene of this pastoral is very accurately delineated. We behold
8857,GALLUS.,"the forlorn Gallus stretched along beneath a solitary cliff, his flocks"
8858,GALLUS.,standing round him at some distance. A group of deities and swains
8859,GALLUS.,"encircle him, each of whom is particularly described. On one side we see"
8860,GALLUS.,"the shepherds with their crooks; next to them the neatherds, known by"
8861,GALLUS.,the clumsiness of their appearance; and next to these Menalcas with his
8862,GALLUS.,"clothes wet, as just come from beating or gathering winter-mast. On the"
8863,GALLUS.,other side we observe Apollo with his usual insignia; Sylvanus crowned
8864,GALLUS.,"with flowers, and brandishing in his hand the long lilies and flowering"
8865,GALLUS.,"fennel; and last of all, Pan, the god of shepherds, known by his ruddy"
8866,GALLUS.,"smiling countenance, and the other peculiarities of his form."
8867,GALLUS.,
8868,GALLUS.,"Gallus was a Roman of very considerable rank, a poet of no small"
8869,GALLUS.,"estimation, and an intimate friend of Virgil. He loved to distraction"
8870,GALLUS.,"one Cytheris (here called Lycoris) who slighted him, and followed Antony"
8871,GALLUS.,into Gaul.
