8,NOTE,"For the privilege of reprinting the rimes gathered here I am indebted to the courtesy of the _Chicago Tribune_ and _Puck_, in whose pages most of them first appeared. ""The Lay of St. Ambrose"" is new. "
9,NOTE,"One reason for rounding up this fugitive verse and prisoning it between covers was this: Frequently--more or less--I receive a request for a copy of this jingle or that, and it is easier to mention a publishing house than to search through ancient and dusty files. "
10,NOTE,The other reason was that I wanted to.

12,_TO MY READERS_,_TO MY READERS_ 
13,_TO MY READERS_,"_Not merely of this book,--but a larger company, with whom, through the medium of the_ Chicago Tribune, _I have been on very pleasant terms for several years,--this handful of rime is joyously dedicated._ "
14,THE LAY OF ST. AMBROSE,THE LAY OF ST. AMBROSE 
15,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"""_And hard by doth dwell, in St. Catherine's cell,_ _Ambrose, the anchorite old and grey._"" --THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS. "
16,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Ambrose the anchorite old and grey Larruped himself in his lonely cell, And many a welt on his pious pelt The scourge evoked as it rose and fell. "
17,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"For hours together the flagellant leather Went whacketty-whack with his groans of pain; And the lay-brothers said, with a wag of the head, ""Ambrose has been at the bottle again."" "
18,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"And such, in sooth, was the sober truth; For the single fault of this saintly soul Was a desert thirst for the cup accurst,-- A quenchless love for the Flowing Bowl. "
19,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"When he woke at morn with a head forlorn And a taste like a last-year swallow's nest, He would kneel and pray, then rise and flay His sinful body like all possessed. "
20,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Frequently tempted, he fell from grace, And as often he found the devil to pay; But by diligent scourging and diligent purging He managed to keep Old Nick at bay. "
21,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"This was the plight of our anchorite,-- An endless penance condemned to dree,-- When it chanced one day there came his way A Mystical Book with a golden Key. "
22,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"This Mystical Book was a guide to health, That none might follow and go astray; While a turn of the Key unlocked the wealth That all unknown in the Scriptures lay. "
23,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Disease is sin, the Book defined; Sickness is error to which men cling; Pain is merely a state of mind, And matter a non-existent thing. "
24,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"If a tooth should ache, or a leg should break, You simply ""affirm"" and it's sound again. Cut and contusion are only delusion, And indigestion a fancied pain. "
25,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"For pain is naught if you ""hold a thought,"" Fevers fly at your simple say; You have but to affirm, and every germ Will fold up its tent and steal away. "
26,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,. . . . . . . . . . 
27,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"From matin gong to even-song Ambrose pondered this mystic lore, Till what had seemed fiction took on a conviction That words had never possessed before. "
28,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"""If pain,"" quoth he, ""is a state of mind, If a rough hair shirt to silk is kin,-- If these things are error, pray where's the terror In scourging and purging oneself of sin? "
29,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"""It certainly seemeth good to me, By and large, in part and in whole. I'll put it in practice and find if it fact is, Or only a mystical rigmarole."" "
30,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,. . . . . . . . . . 
31,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"The very next night our anchorite Of the Flowing Bowl drank long and deep. He argued this wise: ""New Thought applies No fitter to lamb than it does to sheep."" "
32,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"When he woke at morn with a head forlorn And a taste akin to a parrot's cage, He knelt and prayed, then up and flayed His sinful flesh in a righteous rage. "
33,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Whacketty-whack on breast and back, Whacketty-whack, before, behind; But he held the thought as he laid it on, ""Pain is merely a state of mind."" "
34,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Whacketty-whack on breast and back, Whacketty-whack on calf and shin; And the lay-brothers said, with a wag of the head, ""_Ain't_ he the glutton for discipline!"" "
35,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,. . . . . . . . . . 
36,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Now every night our anchorite Was exceedingly tight when he went to bed. The scourge that once pained him no longer restrained him, Nor even the fear of an aching head. "
37,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"For he woke at morn with a pate as clear As the silvery chime of the matin bell; And without any jogging he fell to his flogging, And larruped himself in his lonely cell. "
38,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"But the leather had lost its power to sting; To pangs of the flesh he was now immune; His rough hair shirt no longer hurt, Nor the pebbles he wore in his wooden shoon. "
39,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"When conscience was troubled he cheerfully doubled His matinal dose of discipline;-- A deuce of a scourging, sufficient for purging The Devil himself of original sin. "
40,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Whacketty-whack on breast and back, Whacketty-whack from morn to noon; Whacketty-whacketty-whacketty-whack!-- Till the abbey rang with the dismal tune. "
41,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Deacon and prior, lay-brother and friar Exclaimed at these whoppings spectacular; And even the Abbot remarked that the habit Of scourging oneself might be carried too far. "
42,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"""My son,"" said he, ""I am pleased to see Such penance as never was known before; But you raise such a racket in dusting your jacket, The noise is becoming a bit of a bore. "
43,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"""How would it do if you whaled yourself From eight to ten or from one to three? Or if 'More' is your motto, pray hire a grotto; I know of one you can have rent free."" "
44,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,. . . . . . . . . . 
45,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"Ambrose the anchorite bowed his head, And girded his loins and went away. He rented a cavern not far from a tavern, And tippled by night and scourged by day. "
46,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"The more the penance the more the sin, The more he whopped him the more he drank; Till his hair fell out and his cheeks fell in, And his corpulent figure grew long and lank. "
47,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"At Whitsuntide he up and died, While flaying himself for his final spree. And who shall say whether 'twas liquor or leather That hurried him into eternity? "
48,--THE LAY OF ST. NICHOLAS.,"They made him a saint, as well they might, And gave him a beautiful aureole. And--somehow or other, this circle of light Suggests the rim of the Flowing Bowl. "
49,TO A TALL SPRUCE,TO A TALL SPRUCE 
50,TO A TALL SPRUCE,"Pride of the forest primeval, Peer of the glorious pine, Doomed to an end that is evil, Fearful the fate that is thine! "
51,TO A TALL SPRUCE,"Peer of the glorious pine, Now the landlooker has found you, Fearful the fate that is thine-- Fate of the spruces around you. "
52,TO A TALL SPRUCE,"Now the landlooker has found you, Stripped of your beautiful plume-- Fate of the spruces around you-- Swiftly you'll draw to your doom. "
53,TO A TALL SPRUCE,"Stripped of your beautiful plume, Bzzng! into logs they will whip you. Swiftly you'll draw to your doom; To the pulp mill they will ship you. "
54,TO A TALL SPRUCE,"Bzzng! into logs they will whip you, Lumbermen greedy for gold. To the pulp mill they will ship you. Hearken, there's worse to be told! "
55,TO A TALL SPRUCE,"Lumbermen greedy for gold Over your ruins will caper. Hearken, there's worse to be told: You will be made into paper! "
56,TO A TALL SPRUCE,Over your ruins will caper Murderous shavers and hooks. You will be made into paper! You will be made into books! 
57,TO A TALL SPRUCE,"Murderous shavers and hooks Swiftly your pride will diminish. You will be made into books! Horrible, horrible finish! "
58,TO A TALL SPRUCE,"Swiftly your pride will diminish. You will become a romance! Horrible, horrible finish! Fate has no sadder mischance. "
59,TO A TALL SPRUCE,"You will become a romance, Filled with ""Gadzooks!"" and ""Have at you!"" Fate has no sadder mischance; It would wring tears from a statue. "
60,TO A TALL SPRUCE,"Filled with ""Gadzooks!"" and ""Have at you!"" You may become a ""Lazarre""-- (It would wring tears from a statue)-- ""Graustark,"" ""Stovepipe of Navarre."" "
61,TO A TALL SPRUCE,"You may become a ""Lazarre""; Fate has still worse it can turn on-- ""Graustark,"" ""Stovepipe of Navarre,"" Even a ""Dorothy Vernon""! "
62,TO A TALL SPRUCE,"Fate has still worse it can turn on-- Lower you cannot descend; Even a ""Dorothy Vernon""!-- That is the limit--the end. "
63,TO A TALL SPRUCE,"Lower you cannot descend. Doomed to an end that is evil, That _is_ the limit--the _end_! Pride of the forest primeval. "
64,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,IN THE LAMPLIGHT 
65,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,"The dinner done, the lamp is lit, And in its mellow glow we sit And talk of matters, grave and gay, That went to make another day. Comes Little One, a book in hand, With this request, nay, this command-- (For who'd gainsay the little sprite)-- ""Please--will you read to me to-night?"" "
66,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,"Read to you, Little One? Why, yes. What shall it be to-night? You guess You'd like to hear about the Bears-- Their bowls of porridge, beds and chairs? Well, that you shall.... There! that tale's done! And now--you'd like another one? To-morrow evening, Curly Head. It's ""hass-pass seven."" Off to bed! "
67,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,"So each night another story: Wicked dwarfs and giants gory; Dragons fierce and princes daring, Forth to fame and fortune faring; Wandering tots, with leaves for bed; Houses made of gingerbread; Witches bad and fairies good, And all the wonders of the wood. "
68,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,"""I like the witches best,"" says she Who nightly nestles on my knee; And why by them she sets such store, Psychologists may puzzle o'er. Her likes are mine, and I agree With all that she confides to me. And thus we travel, hand in hand, The storied roads of Fairyland. "
69,IN THE LAMPLIGHT,"Ah, Little One, when years have fled, And left their silver on my head, And when the dimming eyes of age With difficulty scan the page, Perhaps _I'll_ turn the tables then; Perhaps _I'll_ put the question, when I borrow of your better sight-- ""Please--will you read to me to-night?"" "
70,THE BREAKFAST FOOD FAMILY,THE BREAKFAST FOOD FAMILY 
71,THE BREAKFAST FOOD FAMILY,"John Spratt will eat no fat, Nor will he touch the lean; He scorns to eat of any meat, He lives upon Foodine. "
72,THE BREAKFAST FOOD FAMILY,"But Mrs. Spratt will none of that, Foodine she cannot eat; Her special wish is for a dish Of Expurgated Wheat. "
73,THE BREAKFAST FOOD FAMILY,To William Spratt that food is flat On which his mater dotes. His favorite feed--his special need-- Is Eata Heapa Oats. 
74,THE BREAKFAST FOOD FAMILY,"But sister Lil can't see how Will Can touch such tasteless food. As breakfast fare it can't compare, She says, with Shredded Wood. "
75,THE BREAKFAST FOOD FAMILY,"Now, none of these Leander please, He feeds upon Bath Mitts. While sister Jane improves her brain With Cero-Grapo-Grits. "
76,THE BREAKFAST FOOD FAMILY,Lycurgus votes for Father's Oats; Proggine appeals to May; The junior John subsists upon Uneeda Bayla Hay. 
77,THE BREAKFAST FOOD FAMILY,"Corrected Wheat for little Pete; Flaked Pine for Dot; while ""Bub"" The infant Spratt is waxing fat On Battle Creek Near-Grub. "
78,"""TREASURE ISLAND""","""TREASURE ISLAND"" "
79,"""TREASURE ISLAND""","Comes little lady, a book in hand, A light in her eyes that I understand, And her cheeks aglow from the faery breeze That sweeps across the uncharted seas. She gives me the book, and her word of praise A ton of critical thought outweighs. ""I've finished it, daddie!""--a sigh thereat. ""Are there any more books in the world like that?"" "
80,"""TREASURE ISLAND""","No, little lady. I grieve to say That of all the books in the world to-day There's not another that's quite the same As this magic book with the magic name. Volumes there be that are pure delight, Ancient and yellowed or new and bright; But--little and thin, or big and fat-- There are no more books in the world like that. "
81,"""TREASURE ISLAND""","And what, little lady, would I not give For the wonderful world in which you live! What have I garnered one-half as true As the tales Titania whispers you? Ah, late we learn that the only truth Was that which we found in the Book of Youth. Profitless others, and stale, and flat;-- There are no more books in the world like that. "
82,A BALLADE OF SPRING'S UNREST,A BALLADE OF SPRING'S UNREST 
83,A BALLADE OF SPRING'S UNREST,"Up in the woodland where Spring Comes as a laggard, the breeze Whispers the pines that the King, Fallen, has yielded the keys To his White Palace and flees Northward o'er mountain and dale. Speed then the hour that frees! Ho, for the pack and the trail! "
84,A BALLADE OF SPRING'S UNREST,"Northward my fancy takes wing, Restless am I, ill at ease. Pleasures the city can bring Lose now their power to please. Barren, all barren, are these, Town life's a tedious tale; That cup is drained to the lees-- Ho, for the pack and the trail! "
85,A BALLADE OF SPRING'S UNREST,"Ho, for the morning I sling Pack at my back, and with knees Brushing a thoroughfare, fling Into the green mysteries: One with the birds and the bees, One with the squirrel and quail, Night, and the stream's melodies-- Ho, for the pack and the trail! "
86,A BALLADE OF SPRING'S UNREST,_L'Envoi_ 
87,A BALLADE OF SPRING'S UNREST,"Pictures and music and teas, Theaters--books even--stale. Ho, for the smell of the trees! Ho, for the pack and the trail! "
88,WHY?,WHY? 
89,WHY?,"Why, when the sun is gold, The weather fine, The air (this phrase is old) Like Gascon wine;-- "
90,WHY?,"Why, when the leaves are red, And yellow, too, And when (as has been said) The skies are blue;-- "
91,WHY?,"Why, when all things promote One's peace and joy,-- A joy that is (to quote) Without alloy;-- "
92,WHY?,"Why, when a man's well off, Happy and gay, _Why_ must he go play golf And spoil his day! "
93,THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE,THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE 
94,THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE,(_Now happily extinct._) 
95,THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE,"Twas in a vault beneath the street, In the trench of the traction rope, That I found a guy with a fishy eye And a think tank filled with dope. "
96,THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE,"His hair was matted, his face was black, And matted and black was he; And I heard this wight in the vault recite, ""In a singular minor key"": "
97,THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE,"""Oh, I am the guy with the fishy eye And the think tank filled with dope. My work is to watch the beautiful botch That's known as the Clark Street Rope. "
98,THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE,"""I pipes my eye as the rope goes by For every danger spot. If I spies one out I gives a shout, And we puts in another knot. "
99,THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE,"""Them knots is all like brothers to me, And I loves 'em, one and all."" The muddy guy with the fishy eye A muddy tear let fall. "
100,THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE,"""There goes a knot we tied last week, There's one what we tied to-day; And there's a patch was hard to reach, And caused six hours' delay. "
101,THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE,"""Two hundred seventy-nine, all told, And I knows their history; And I'm most attached to a break we patched In the winter of 'eighty-three. "
102,THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE,"""For every time that knot comes round It sings out, 'Howdy, Bill! We'll walk 'em home to-night, old man, From here to the Ferris Wheel. "
103,THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE,"""'We'll walk 'em in the rush hours, Bill, A swearing company, As we've walked 'em, Bill, since I was tied, In the winter of 'eighty-three.'"" "
104,THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE,"The muddy guy with the fishy eye Let fall another tear. ""Them knots is wife and child to me; I've known 'em forty year. "
105,THE RIME OF THE CLARK STREET CABLE,"""For I am the guy with the fishy eye And the think tank filled with dope, Whose work is to watch the lovely botch That's known as the Clark Street Rope."" "
106,MISS LEGION,MISS LEGION 
107,MISS LEGION,"She is hotfoot after Cultyure, She pursues it with a club. She breathes a heavy atmosphere Of literary flub. No literary shrine so far But she is there to kneel; But-- Her favorite line of reading Is O. Meredith's ""Lucille."" "
108,MISS LEGION,Of course she's up on pictures-- Passes for a connoisseur. On free days at the Institute You'll always notice her. She qualifies approval Of a Titian or Corot; But-- She throws a fit of rapture When she comes to Bouguereau. 
109,MISS LEGION,"And when you talk of music, She is Music's devotee. She will tell you that Beethoven Always makes her wish to pray; And ""dear old Bach!"" His very name She says, her ear enchants; But-- Her favorite piece is Weber's ""Invitation to the Dance."" "
110,A BALLADE OF DEATH AND TIME,A BALLADE OF DEATH AND TIME 
111,A BALLADE OF DEATH AND TIME,"I hold it truth with him who sweetly sings-- The weekly music of the _London Sphere_-- That deathless tomes the living present brings: Great literature is with us year on year. Books of the mighty dead, whom men revere, Remind me I can make _my_ books sublime. But prithee, bay my brow while I am here: Why do we always wait for Death and Time? "
112,A BALLADE OF DEATH AND TIME,"Shakespeare, great spirit, beat his mighty wings, As I beat mine, for the occasion near. He knew, as I, the worth of present things: Great literature is with us year on year. Methinks I meet across the gulf his clear And tranquil eye; his calm reflections chime With mine: ""Why do we at the present fleer? Why do we always wait for Death and Time?"" "
113,A BALLADE OF DEATH AND TIME,"The reading world with acclamation rings For my last book. It led the list at Weir, Altoona, Rahway, Painted Post, Hot Springs: Great literature is with us year on year. The _Bookman_ gives me a vociferous cheer. Howells approves! I can no higher climb. Bring then the laurel, crown my bright career. Why do we always wait for Death and Time? "
114,A BALLADE OF DEATH AND TIME,_L'Envoi_ 
115,A BALLADE OF DEATH AND TIME,"Critics, who pastward, ever pastward peer, Great literature is with us year on year. Trumpet my fame while I am in my prime. Why do we always wait for Death and Time? "
116,THE KAISER'S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY,THE KAISER'S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY 
117,THE KAISER'S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY,"Aufwiedersehen, brother mine! Farewells will soon be kissed; And ere you leave to breast the brine Give me once more your fist; "
118,THE KAISER'S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY,"That mailéd fist, clenched high in air On many a foreign shore, Enforcing coaling stations where No stations were before; "
119,THE KAISER'S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY,"That fist, which weaker nations view As if 'twere Michael's own, And which appals the heathen who Bow down to wood and stone. "
120,THE KAISER'S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY,But this trip no brass knuckles. Glove That heavy mailéd hand; Your mission now is one of Love And Peace--you understand. 
121,THE KAISER'S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY,"All that's American you'll praise; The Yank can do no wrong. To use his own expressive phrase, Just ""jolly him along."" "
122,THE KAISER'S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY,"Express surprise to find, the more Of Roosevelt you see, How much I am like Theodore, And Theodore like me. "
123,THE KAISER'S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY,"I am, in fact, (this might not be A bad thing to suggest,) The Theodore of the East, and he The William of the West. "
124,THE KAISER'S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY,"And, should you get a chance, find out-- If anybody knows-- Exactly what it's all about, That Doctrine of Monroe's. "
125,THE KAISER'S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY,"That's _entre nous_. My present plan You know as well as I: Be just as Yankee as you can; If needs be, eat some pie. "
126,THE KAISER'S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY,"Cut out the 'kraut, cut out Rhine wine, Cut out the Schützenfest, The Sängerbund, the Turnverein, The Kommers, and the rest. "
127,THE KAISER'S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY,"And if some fool society ""Die Wacht am Rhein"" should sing, _You_ sing ""My Country, 'Tis of Thee""-- The tune's ""God Save the King."" "
128,THE KAISER'S FAREWELL TO PRINCE HENRY,"To our own kindred in that land There's not much you need tell. Just tell them that you saw me, and That I was looking well. "
129,TO LILLIAN RUSSELL,TO LILLIAN RUSSELL 
130,TO LILLIAN RUSSELL,(_A reminiscence of 18--._) 
131,TO LILLIAN RUSSELL,"Dear Lillian! (The ""dear"" one risks; ""Miss Russell"" were a bit austerer)-- Do you remember Mr. Fiske's _Dramatic Mirror_ "
132,TO LILLIAN RUSSELL,Back when--? (But we'll not count the years; The way they've sped is most surprising.) You were a trifle in arrears For advertising. 
133,TO LILLIAN RUSSELL,I brought the bill to your address; I was the _Mirror's_ bill collector-- In Thespian haunts a more or less Familiar spectre. 
134,TO LILLIAN RUSSELL,"On that (to me) momentous day You dwelt amid the city's clatter, A few doors west of old Broadway; The street--no matter. "
135,TO LILLIAN RUSSELL,"But while you have forgot the debt, And him who called in line of duty, He never, never shall forget Your wondrous beauty. "
136,TO LILLIAN RUSSELL,"You were too fair for mortal speech,-- Enchanting, positively rippin'; You were some dream, and quelque peach, And beaucoup pippin. "
137,TO LILLIAN RUSSELL,"Your ""fight with Time"" had not begun, Nor any reason to promote it; No beauty battles to be won. Beauty? You wrote it! "
138,TO LILLIAN RUSSELL,"""A bill?"" you murmured in distress, ""A bill?"" (I still can hear you say it.) ""A bill from Mr. Fiske? Oh, yes ... I'll call and pay it."" "
139,TO LILLIAN RUSSELL,"And he, the thrice-requited kid, That such a goddess should address him, Could only blush and paw his lid, And stammer, ""Yes'm!"" "
140,TO LILLIAN RUSSELL,"Eheu! It seems a cycle since, But still the nerve of memory tingles. And here you're writing Beauty Hints, And I these jingles. "
141,DORNRÖSCHEN,DORNRÖSCHEN 
142,DORNRÖSCHEN,"In the great hall of Castle Innocence, Hedged round with thorns of maiden doubts and fears,-- Within, without, a silence grave, intense,-- Her soul lies sleeping through the rose-leaf years. "
143,DORNRÖSCHEN,"Hedged round with thorns of maiden doubts and fears; And all save one the thither path shall miss. Her soul lies sleeping through the rose-leaf years, Waiting the Prince and his awakening kiss. "
144,DORNRÖSCHEN,"And all save one the thither path shall miss; For one alone may thread the thorn defence. Waiting the Prince and his awakening kiss, A hush broods over Castle Innocence. "
145,DORNRÖSCHEN,"For one alone may thread the thorn defence, Care free, heart free, and singing on his way. A hush broods over Castle Innocence One comes to wake;--but when--ah, who can say! "
146,DORNRÖSCHEN,"Care free, heart free, and singing on his way, One comes all thorns of Fear and Doubt to dare. One comes to wake! But when? Ah, who can say The hour his light feet press the castle stair? "
147,DORNRÖSCHEN,One comes all thorns of Fear and Doubt to dare! Thorns with his coming into roses bloom. The hour his light feet press the castle stair The warders of the castle hall give room. 
148,DORNRÖSCHEN,Thorns with his coming into roses bloom; For him the flowers of Trust and Faith unfold. The warders of the castle hall give room Before the young Prince of the Heart of Gold. 
149,DORNRÖSCHEN,For him the flowers of Trust and Faith unfold; Till then the thorns of maiden doubts and fears. Before the young Prince of the Heart of Gold Her rose-soul slumbers through the tranquil years. 
150,DORNRÖSCHEN,"Till then the thorns of maiden doubts and fears. Within, without, a silence grave, intense. Her rose-soul slumbers through the tranquil years In the great hall of Castle Innocence. "
151,"""FAREWELL!""","""FAREWELL!"" "
152,"""FAREWELL!""","(_Evoked by Calverley's ""Forever.""_) "
153,"""FAREWELL!""","""Farewell!"" Another gloomy word As ever into language crept. 'Tis often written, never heard Except "
154,R. U.,"In playhouse. Ere the hero flits (In handcuffs) from our pitying view, ""Farewell!"" he murmurs, then exits R. U. "
155,R. U.,"""Farewell!"" is much too sighful for An age that has not time to sigh. We say, ""I'll see you later,"" or ""Good-bye!"" "
156,R. U.,"""Fare well"" meant long ago, before It crept tear-spattered into song, ""Safe voyage!"" ""Pleasant journey!"" or ""So long!"" "
157,R. U.,"But gone its cheery, old-time ring: The poets made it rime with knell. Joined, it became a dismal thing-- ""Farewell!"" "
158,R. U.,"""Farewell!"" Into the lover's soul You see fate plunge the cruel iron. All poets use it. It's the whole Of Byron. "
159,R. U.,"""I only feel--farewell!"" said he; And always tearful was the telling. Lord Byron was eternally Farewelling. "
160,R. U.,"""Farewell!"" A dismal word, 'tis true. (And why not tell the truth about it?) But what on earth would poets do Without it! "
161,REFORM IN OUR TOWN,REFORM IN OUR TOWN 
162,REFORM IN OUR TOWN,"There was a man in Our Town And Jimson was his name, Who cried, ""Our civic government Is honeycombed with shame."" He called us neighbors in and said, ""By Graft we're overrun. Let's have a general cleaning up, As other towns have done."" "
163,REFORM IN OUR TOWN,"The citizens of Our Town Responded to the call; Beneath the banner of Reform We gathered one and all. We sent away for men expert In hunting civic sin, To ask these practised gentlemen Just how we should begin. "
164,REFORM IN OUR TOWN,"The experts came to Our Town And told us how 'twas done. ""Begin with Gas and Traction, And half your fight is won. Begin with Gas and Traction; The rest will follow soon."" We looked at one another And hummed a different tune. "
165,REFORM IN OUR TOWN,"Said Smith, ""Saloons in Our Town Are palaces of shame."" Said Jones, ""Police corruption Has hurt the town's fair name."" Said Brown, ""Our lawless children Pitch pennies as they please."" Now would it not be wiser To start Reform with these? "
166,REFORM IN OUR TOWN,"The men who came to Our Town Replied, ""No haste with these; Begin with Gas--or Water-- The roots of the disease."" We looked at one another And hemmed and hawed a bit; Enthusiasm faded then From every single cit. "
167,REFORM IN OUR TOWN,"The men who came to Our Town Expressed a mild surprise, Then they too at each other Looked ""with a wild surmise."" Jimson had stock in Traction, And Jones had stock in Gas, And Smith and Brown in this and that, So--nothing came to pass. "

No problem bothered him a bit; He made both head and tail of it. So wise he was, so wise and solemn, Each thought filled just a spinal column. If one brain found the pressure strong It passed a few ideas along; If something slipped his forward mind 'Twas rescued by the one behind; And if in error he was caught He had a saving afterthought. As he thought twice before he spoke He had no judgments to revoke; For he could think, without congestion, Upon both sides of every question. "

373,I,"Daphne, here it is July! Just the month, my love, to fly To a sylvan solitude In the green and ancient wood. We will trip it as we go On the neo-Pagan toe, Sunny days and starry nights, Savoring the wild delights Of a turbulent desire That may set the wood on fire. "
374,I,"We will play at hunt-the-fawn, In the neo-Dorian dawn. You will scamper through the brake, And I'll follow in your wake-- "
375,I,"As the young Apollo ran In the piping days of Pan. You'll escape me, without doubt, For I'm just a trifle stout; But, when I have lagged behind, Waiting for my second wynde, From some pretty hiding-place Will emerge your laughing face; I shall glimpse your eyes of blue, Hear your merry ""Peek-a-boo!"" "
376,I,"What to wear? The Pagan plan Contemplates a coat of tan; But I fear we shall require Just a trifle more attire. Bushes scratch and brambles sting; Insect myriads are a-wing;-- Heavens, how mosquitoes swarm When the woodland air is warm. (MEM: To take, when we elope, Tanglewood Mosquito Dope.) "
377,I,"Do you like the picture, dear? Have you aught of doubt or fear? Have you any criticism Of my neo-Paganism? If not, dearie, let us fly To that passion-ripening sky, Where our souls may have their fling, And our every care take wing. "
378,I,"_So the bird song fluted by,_ _Like a vagrant summer sigh--_ _Came, and passed, and was no more;_ _And my pleasant dream was o'er._ _For arose the wraith of Doubt;_ _And I knew my pipe was out._ "

We will play at hide and seek In the alders by the creek; Sport amid the cascade's smother. Splashing water at each other;-- Every moment pleasure wooing, Every moment something doing. If we talk, we'll talk of Love: All its arguments we'll prove. Such a mental rest you'll find. Leave your intellect behind. "
382,II,"Night will come, (for come it will, 'Spite the fluting on the hill,) And we'll pitch a cozy camp Where it isn't quite so damp. While you dry your hair and laze By the campfire's violet blaze, I will rob a balsam tree To construct a house for thee. What so dear as to be wooed In a sylvan solitude? "
383,II,"What so sweet as Pagan vows Whispered in a house of boughs? Pagan love's without alloy. Pagan kisses never cloy. Arms that cling in Pagan fashion Never tire. A Pagan passion Is the only kind I know That outlives a winter's snow. Daphne, Daphne, let us fly! You're a Pagan--so am I. "

And often, when drying my hands in this fashion, The tears of remembrance will gather and fall, And I sigh (though I'm not what you'd call sentimental) For the classic old towel that propped up the wall. The sainted old towel, the tainted old towel, The gooey old towel that hung on the wall. "
472,UP CULTURE'S HILL,UP CULTURE'S HILL 
473,UP CULTURE'S HILL,(_The confession of a club lady._) 
474,UP CULTURE'S HILL,"The path up Culture's Hill is steep, And weary is the way, With very little time for sleep And none at all for play. "
475,UP CULTURE'S HILL,"She that this toilsome task essays Must never bat an eye, But keep her firm, unwavering gaze Forever fixed on high. "
476,UP CULTURE'S HILL,"For should she ever careless grow, And let her glances stray Down to the shallow vale below, Where Pleasure's Court holds sway-- "
477,UP CULTURE'S HILL,"Lured by the thrice forbidden fruit, She'd lose her equipoise, And like a wayward Pleiad shoot Down to forbidden joys. "
478,UP CULTURE'S HILL,"I've been but short time on the road, My courage still is strong; Yet often have I felt the goad That hurries me along. "
479,UP CULTURE'S HILL,"I've fallen over Maeterlinck, And bumped myself to tears, Burne-Jones's pictures made me blink, And Wagner hurts my ears. "
480,UP CULTURE'S HILL,"I've stumbled over Ibsen humps And over Rembrandt rocks, I've got some fierce Debussy bumps, Some awful Nietsche knocks. "
481,UP CULTURE'S HILL,"I'm wearied by the ceaseless quest, I'm wayworn and footsore. I've Culture till I cannot rest-- Yet still I climb for more. "
482,UP CULTURE'S HILL,"But oh, when all is done and said, Upon some manly breast I'd like to lay my tired head And take a good long rest. "
483,THE PASSIONAL NOTE,THE PASSIONAL NOTE 
484,--MR. SYLVESTER VIERECK.,"""_The erotic motive is almost entirely absent from American poetry. Even our younger American poets are more profoundly interested in the why and wherefore of things than in the girdle of Helen or the gleaming limbs of 'the white implacable Aphrodite.'_"" --MR. SYLVESTER VIERECK. "
485,--MR. SYLVESTER VIERECK.,"In the years of my season erotic, When Eros was lord of my days, And I loved, with a love idiotic, The Mabels and Madges and Mays; When a purple and passionate lyric Would sing all the night in my head,-- I yearned, like the young Mr. Viereck, For everything red. "
486,--MR. SYLVESTER VIERECK.,"I doted on poems of passion, And put my own pantings in rime, To celebrate, after a fashion, The damsels who took up my time. I fed upon Swinburne, believe me, I feasted on Byron and Burns, And couplets from Sappho would give me Most exquisite turns. "
487,--MR. SYLVESTER VIERECK.,"How apparent it was that our songbirds-- Our Emerson, Lowell, and Payne, And Bryant and Drake--were the wrong birds To pipe to the passional strain. There was, in a word, nothing doing In all of the rimes that they wrote; They seemed to be always pursuing The ethical note. "
488,--MR. SYLVESTER VIERECK.,"What truth, I inquired, was so mighty, What ethical thing was so rare, As the limbs of the white Aphrodite Or a strand of her heaven-kissed hair! The girdle of red-headed Helen Outweighed all the wherefores and whys, And Wisdom elected to dwell in A pair of blue eyes. "
489,--MR. SYLVESTER VIERECK.,"_Now_ lyrical sizzlers and scorchers Fail somehow to set me ablaze; No longer are exquisite tortures Provoked by these passionate lays. I've tinned--and I can't say I've missed 'em-- The poems of passion and sin. _Some_ things one gets out of one's system, And other things _in_. "
