103,THE SEED SHOP.,
104,THE SEED SHOP.,"Here in a quiet and dusty room they lie,"
105,THE SEED SHOP.,"Faded as crumbled stone or shifting sand,"
106,THE SEED SHOP.,"Forlorn as ashes, shrivelled, scentless, dry--"
107,THE SEED SHOP.,Meadows and gardens running through my hand.
108,THE SEED SHOP.,
109,THE SEED SHOP.,"Dead that shall quicken at the call of Spring,"
110,THE SEED SHOP.,"Sleepers to stir beneath June's magic kiss,"
111,THE SEED SHOP.,"Though birds pass over, unremembering,"
112,THE SEED SHOP.,And no bee seek here roses that were his.
113,THE SEED SHOP.,
114,THE SEED SHOP.,In this brown husk a dale of hawthorn dreams
115,THE SEED SHOP.,A cedar in this narrow cell is thrust
116,THE SEED SHOP.,"That will drink deeply of a century's streams,"
117,THE SEED SHOP.,These lilies shall make summer on my dust.
118,THE SEED SHOP.,
119,THE SEED SHOP.,"Here in their safe and simple house of death,"
120,THE SEED SHOP.,Sealed in their shells a million roses leap;
121,THE SEED SHOP.,"Here I can blow a garden with my breath,"
122,THE SEED SHOP.,And in my hand a forest lies asleep.

167,THE NEW ASPASIA.,THE NEW ASPASIA.
168,THE NEW ASPASIA.,
169,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"If I have given myself to you and you,"
170,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"And if these pale hands are not virginal,"
171,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"Nor these bright lips beneath your own lips true,"
172,THE NEW ASPASIA.,What matters it?  I do not stand nor fall
173,THE NEW ASPASIA.,By your old foolish judgments of desire:
174,THE NEW ASPASIA.,If this were Helen's way it is not mine;
175,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"I bring you beauty, but no Troys to fire:"
176,THE NEW ASPASIA.,The cup I hold brims not with Borgia's wine.
177,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"You, so soon snared of sudden brows and breasts,"
178,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"Lightly you think upon these lips, this hair."
179,THE NEW ASPASIA.,My thoughts are kinder: you are pity's guests:
180,THE NEW ASPASIA.,Compassion's bed you share.
181,THE NEW ASPASIA.,
182,THE NEW ASPASIA.,It was not lust delivered me to you;
183,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"I gave my wondering mouth for pity's sake,"
184,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"For your strange, sighing lips I did but break"
185,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"Many times this bread, and poured this wine anew."
186,THE NEW ASPASIA.,My body's woven sweetness and kindling hair
187,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"Were given for heal of hurts unknown of me,"
188,THE NEW ASPASIA.,For something I could slake but could not share.
189,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"Sudden and rough and cruel I let you be,"
190,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"I gave my body for what the world calls sin,"
191,THE NEW ASPASIA.,Even as for your souls the Nazarene
192,THE NEW ASPASIA.,Gave once.  Long years in pity I and He
193,THE NEW ASPASIA.,Have served you--Jesus and the Magdalen.
194,THE NEW ASPASIA.,
195,THE NEW ASPASIA.,As on the river in the fading light
196,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"A rust-red sail across the evening creeps,"
197,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"Torching the gloom, and slowly sinks from sight,"
198,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"The blood may rise to some old face at night,"
199,THE NEW ASPASIA.,Remembering old sins before it sleeps.
200,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"So might you hence recall me, were I true"
201,THE NEW ASPASIA.,To your sad violence.  Were I not free
202,THE NEW ASPASIA.,So me you might remember now; but you
203,THE NEW ASPASIA.,Were no more loved by me
204,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"Than clouds at sunset, or the wild bird going"
205,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"About his pleasure on the apple tree,"
206,THE NEW ASPASIA.,Or wide-blown roses swelling to the bee;
207,THE NEW ASPASIA.,No sweeter than flowers suddenly found growing
208,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"In frost-bound dells, or, on the bare, high hills,"
209,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"The gold, unlaced, dew-drunken daffodils"
210,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"Shouting the dawn, or the brown river flowing"
211,THE NEW ASPASIA.,Down quietly to the sea;
212,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"Or day in twilight's hair bound safe and dim,"
213,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"Stirless in lavender, or the wind blowing,"
214,THE NEW ASPASIA.,Tumbling the poppy's turban after him.
215,THE NEW ASPASIA.,
216,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"I knew you as I knew these happy things,"
217,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"Passing, unwept, on wide and tranquil wings"
218,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"To their own place in nature; below, above"
219,THE NEW ASPASIA.,Transient passion with its stains and stings.
220,THE NEW ASPASIA.,For this strange pity that you knew not of
221,THE NEW ASPASIA.,Was neither lust nor love.
222,THE NEW ASPASIA.,
223,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"Do not repent, nor pity, nor regret."
224,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"I do not seek your pardon, nor give you mine."
225,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"Pass by, be silent, drop no tears, forget."
226,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"Return not, make no sign"
227,THE NEW ASPASIA.,"When I am dead, nor turn your lips away"
228,THE NEW ASPASIA.,From Phryne's silver limbs and Faustine's kiss.
229,THE NEW ASPASIA.,I need no pity.  No word of pity say.
230,THE NEW ASPASIA.,I have given a new sweet name and crown to this
231,THE NEW ASPASIA.,That served men's lust and was Aspasia.

236,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.
237,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,
238,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,There shall be a song for both of us that day
239,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,"Though fools say you have long outlived your songs,"
240,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,"And when, perhaps, because your hair is grey,"
241,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,"You go unsung, to whom all praise belongs,"
242,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,And no men kiss your hands--your fragile hands
243,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,Folded like empty shells on sea-spurned sands.
244,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,And you that were dawn whereat men shouted once
245,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,"Are sunset now, with but one worshipper,"
246,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,Then to your twilight heart this song shall be
247,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,Sweeter than those that did your youth announce
248,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,For your brave beautiful spirit is lovelier
249,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,Than once your lovely body was to me.
250,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,Your folded hands and your shut eyelids stir
251,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,A passion that Time has crowned with sanctity.
252,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,"Young fools shall wonder why, your youth being over,"
253,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,"You are so sung still, but your heart will know"
254,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,That he who loved your soul was your true lover
255,A SONG FOR OLD LOVE.,And the last song alone was worthy you.

273,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.
274,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,
275,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I am growing old: I have kept youth too long,"
276,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,But I dare not let them know it now.
277,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I have done the heart of youth a grievous wrong,"
278,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Danced it to dust and drugged it with the rose,"
279,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Forced its reluctant lips to one more vow.
280,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I have denied the lawful grey,"
281,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"So kind, so wise, to settle in my hair;"
282,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I belong no more to April, but September has not taught me her repose."
283,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,I wish I had let myself grow old in the quiet way
284,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,That is so gracious....  I wish I did not care.
285,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"My faded mouth will never flower again,"
286,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Under the paint the wrinkles fret my eyes,"
287,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"My hair is dull beneath its henna stain,"
288,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,I have come to the last ramparts of disguise.
289,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,And now the day draws on of my defeat.
290,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,I shall not meet
291,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"The swift, male glance across the crowded room,"
292,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Where the chance contact of limbs in passing has
293,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Its answer in some future fierce embrace.
294,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,I shall sit there in the corners looking on
295,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"With the older women, withered and overblown,"
296,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Who have grown old more graciously than I,"
297,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,In a sort of safe and comfortable tomb
298,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Knitting myself into Eternity.
299,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"And men will talk to me because they are kind,"
300,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Or as cunning or as courtesy demands;
301,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,There will be no hidden question in their eyes
302,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,And no subtle implication in their hands.
303,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,And I shall be so grateful who have been
304,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"So gracious, and so tyrannous, moving between"
305,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Denial and surrender.  To-morrow I shall find
306,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,How women live who have no lovers and no answer for life's
307,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,grey monotonies.
308,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Upon my table will be no more flowers,"
309,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,They will bring me no more flowers till I am dead;
310,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"There will be no violent, sweet, exciting hours,"
311,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,No wild things done or said.
312,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,
313,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Yet sometimes I'm so tired of it all--
314,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"This everlasting battle with the flesh,"
315,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,This pitiful slavery to the body's thrall--
316,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"And then I do not want to lure or charm,"
317,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,I want to wear
318,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Soft, easy things, be comfortable and warm;"
319,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,I want to drowse at leisure in my chair.
320,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I do not want to wear a veil with heavy mesh,"
321,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Or sit in shaded rooms afraid to face the light;
322,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I do not want to go out every night,"
323,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"And be bright and vivid and intense,"
324,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Nor be on the alert and the defence
325,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"With other women, fierce and afraid as I,"
326,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Drawing a knife unseen as each goes by.
327,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,
328,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I am so tired of men and making love,"
329,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,For every one's the same.
330,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,There's nothing new in love beneath the sun;
331,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,All love can say or do has long been said and done:
332,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I have eaten the fruit of knowledge long enough,"
333,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Been over-kissed, over-praised and over-won."
334,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Why should I try to play still the old, foolish game?"
335,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Because I have played the rose's part too long.
336,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Who plays the rose must pay the rose's price,"
337,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,And be a rose or nothing till it dies.
338,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,And even then sometimes the blood will answer fierce and strong
339,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"To the old hunger, to the old dance, old tune;"
340,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,I shall feel cruel and passionate and mad
341,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Though I have lost the look of June.
342,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,The fever of the past will burn my hands
343,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,As men who live long in intemperate lands
344,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Feel the old ague wring them, far removed"
345,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,From the old dreadful glitter of seas and sands.
346,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,The rose dies hard in women who have had
347,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Lovers all their lives, and have been much loved."
348,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,
349,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,I am afraid to grow old now even if I would.
350,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I have fought too well, too long, and what was once"
351,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,A foolish trick to make the rose more strangely gay
352,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Is now a close-locked, mortal conflict of brain and blood--"
353,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,A feud too old to settle or renounce.
354,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I shall grow too tired to struggle, and the fight will end,"
355,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,And they will enter in at last--
356,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Nature and Time, long thwarted of their prey,"
357,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Those old grey two, more cruel for the lips that said them ""Nay,"""
358,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,For the bitterest foe is he who in the past
359,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Has been repulsed when he would fain be friend.
360,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,
361,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I am sorry for women who are growing old,"
362,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I do not blame them holding youth with shameful hold,"
363,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Or doing desperate things to lips and eyes.
364,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"They have so pitifully short a flowering time,"
365,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,So suddenly sweet a story so soon told.
366,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,They only strive to keep what men have taught them most to prize--
367,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Men who have longer, fuller lives to live,"
368,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Who are not stopped and broken in their prime,"
369,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"With their faces still to summer, Men do not know"
370,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,What Age says to a woman.  They would not wait
371,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"To feel slip from their hands without a throe,"
372,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Without a struggle, futile and desperate,"
373,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,All that has given them wealth and love and power
374,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Doomed, without hope or rumour of reprieve."
375,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,They would not smile into the eyes of that advancing hour
376,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Who had bent all summer to their bow, and had flung"
377,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,The widest rose and kissed the keenest mouth
378,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,And slept in the lordliest bed when they were young.
379,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,That bitter twilight which sun-worshipping Youth
380,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Flies headlong keeps Age loitering on the hill,"
381,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Uneager to fold such greyness to his breast,"
382,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Knowing that none will thwart him of his will,"
383,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,None be before him on that quest.
384,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,
385,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,I am growing old.
386,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,I was not always kind when I was young
387,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"To women who were old, for Youth is blind--"
388,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"A small, green, bitter thing beneath its fragrant rind,"
389,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,And fanged against the old with boisterous tongue--
390,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"Those whose poor morning heads are touched with rime,"
391,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Walking before their misery like kings.
392,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I did not think that I should feel such stings,"
393,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,Nor flinch beneath such arrows.  But now I know.
394,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"One day I shall be stupid and rather slow,"
395,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"And easily cowed and troubled in my mind,"
396,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"And tremulous, vaguely frightened, feeble and cold."
397,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I am growing old....  My God! how old, how old! ..."
398,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,"I dare not tell them, but one day they will know..."
399,MRS. EFFINGHAM'S SWAN SONG.,I hope they will be kind.
