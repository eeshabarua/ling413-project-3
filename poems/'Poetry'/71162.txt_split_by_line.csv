147,INTRODUCTION,
148,INTRODUCTION,
149,INTRODUCTION,The _Confessio Amantis_ has been the subject both of exaggerated
150,INTRODUCTION,praise and of undue depreciation. It was the fashion of the fifteenth
151,INTRODUCTION,"and sixteenth centuries to set Gower side by side with Chaucer, and"
152,INTRODUCTION,"to represent them as the twin stars of the new English poetry, a view"
153,INTRODUCTION,"which, however it may be justified by consideration of their language"
154,INTRODUCTION,"and literary tendencies, seems to imply a very uncritical estimate of"
155,INTRODUCTION,their comparative importance. Some of these references are collected
156,INTRODUCTION,"below, and they serve to indicate in a general way that the author had"
157,INTRODUCTION,"a great literary reputation and that his book was very popular, the"
158,INTRODUCTION,latter being a conclusion which is sufficiently vouched for also by the
159,INTRODUCTION,"large number of manuscripts which existed, and by the three printed"
160,INTRODUCTION,editions. We shall confine ourselves here to drawing attention to a few
161,INTRODUCTION,facts of special significance.
162,INTRODUCTION,
163,INTRODUCTION,In the first place the _Confessio Amantis_ is the earliest English
164,INTRODUCTION,book which made its way beyond the limits of its own language. There
165,INTRODUCTION,"exists a Spanish translation, dating apparently from the very beginning"
166,INTRODUCTION,"of the fifteenth century, in which reference is made also to a"
167,INTRODUCTION,"Portuguese version, not known to be now in existence, on which perhaps"
168,INTRODUCTION,the Castilian was based. This double translation into contemporary
169,INTRODUCTION,languages of the Continent must denote that the writer’s fame was not
170,INTRODUCTION,merely insular in his life-time.
171,INTRODUCTION,
172,INTRODUCTION,"Secondly, with regard to the position of this book in the sixteenth"
173,INTRODUCTION,"century, the expressions used by Berthelette seem to me to imply"
174,INTRODUCTION,"something more than a mere formal tribute. This printer, who is"
175,INTRODUCTION,"especially distinguished by his interest in language, in the preface"
176,INTRODUCTION,to his edition of the _Confessio Amantis_ most warmly sets forth his
177,INTRODUCTION,"author as a model of pure English, contrasting his native simplicity"
178,INTRODUCTION,with the extravagant affectations of style and language which were then
179,INTRODUCTION,"in fashion. In fact, when we compare the style of Gower in writing"
180,INTRODUCTION,of love with that which we find in some of the books which were at
181,INTRODUCTION,"that time issuing from the press, we cannot help feeling that the"
182,INTRODUCTION,recommendation was justified.
183,INTRODUCTION,
184,INTRODUCTION,"Again, nearly a century later a somewhat striking testimony to the"
185,INTRODUCTION,position of Gower as a standard author is afforded by Ben Jonson’s
186,INTRODUCTION,_English Grammar_. The syntax contains about a hundred and thirty
187,INTRODUCTION,"illustrative quotations, and of these about thirty are from Gower."
188,INTRODUCTION,"Chaucer is cited twenty-five times, Lydgate and Sir Thomas More each"
189,INTRODUCTION,"about fourteen, the other chief authorities being Norton, Jewel, Fox,"
190,INTRODUCTION,Sir John Cheke and the English Bible.
191,INTRODUCTION,
192,INTRODUCTION,"Finally, our author’s popularity and established position as a"
193,INTRODUCTION,story-teller is decisively vouched for by the partly Shakesperian
194,INTRODUCTION,play of _Pericles_. Plots of plays were usually borrowed without
195,INTRODUCTION,"acknowledgement; but here, a plot being taken from the _Confessio"
196,INTRODUCTION,"Amantis_, the opportunity is seized of bringing Gower himself on the"
197,INTRODUCTION,"stage to act as Prologue to four out of the five acts, speaking in the"
198,INTRODUCTION,"measure of his own octosyllabic couplet,"
199,INTRODUCTION,
200,INTRODUCTION,‘To sing a song that old was sung
201,INTRODUCTION,"From ashes ancient Gower is come,’ &c."
202,INTRODUCTION,
203,INTRODUCTION,The book was so well known and the author so well established in
204,INTRODUCTION,"reputation, that a play evidently gained credit by connecting itself"
205,INTRODUCTION,with his name.
206,INTRODUCTION,
207,INTRODUCTION,The following are the principal references to Gower in the
208,INTRODUCTION,fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The author of _The King’s
209,INTRODUCTION,Quair_ dedicates his poem to the memory (or rather to the
210,INTRODUCTION,poems) of his masters Gower and Chaucer. Hoccleve calls him ‘my
211,INTRODUCTION,"maister Gower,’"
212,INTRODUCTION,
213,INTRODUCTION,‘Whos vertu I am insufficient
214,INTRODUCTION,For to descrive.’
215,INTRODUCTION,
216,INTRODUCTION,"John Walton of Osney, the metrical translator of Boethius,"
217,INTRODUCTION,"writes,"
218,INTRODUCTION,
219,INTRODUCTION,"‘To Chaucer, that is flour of rhethorique"
220,INTRODUCTION,"In english tonge and excellent poete,"
221,INTRODUCTION,"This wot I wel, no thing may I do like,"
222,INTRODUCTION,Though so that I of makinge entermete;
223,INTRODUCTION,"And Gower, that so craftely doth trete"
224,INTRODUCTION,"As in his book<es> of moralite,"
225,INTRODUCTION,"Though I to hem in makinge am unmete,"
226,INTRODUCTION,Yit moste I schewe it forth that is in me.’
227,INTRODUCTION,
228,INTRODUCTION,Bokenham in his _Lives of the Saints_ repeatedly speaks of
229,INTRODUCTION,"Gower, Chaucer and Lydgate, the last of whom was then still"
230,INTRODUCTION,"living, as the three great lights of English literature. Caxton"
231,INTRODUCTION,"printed the _Confessio Amantis_ in 1483, and it seems to have"
232,INTRODUCTION,been one of the most popular productions of his press.
233,INTRODUCTION,
234,INTRODUCTION,In the sixteenth century Gower appears by the side of Chaucer
235,INTRODUCTION,in Dunbar’s _Lament for the Makaris_ and in Lindsay’s poems.
236,INTRODUCTION,Hawes in the _Pastime of Pleasure_ classes him with Chaucer and
237,INTRODUCTION,"his beloved Lydgate, and Skelton introduces him as first in"
238,INTRODUCTION,order of time among the English poets who are mentioned in the
239,INTRODUCTION,"_Garland of Laurel_,"
240,INTRODUCTION,
241,INTRODUCTION,"‘I saw Gower that first garnysshed our Englysshe rude,"
242,INTRODUCTION,"And maister Chaucer,’ &c.,"
243,INTRODUCTION,
244,INTRODUCTION,a testimony which is not quite consistent with that in the
245,INTRODUCTION,"_Lament for Philip Sparow_,"
246,INTRODUCTION,
247,INTRODUCTION,‘Gower’s Englysh is old
248,INTRODUCTION,"And of no value is told,"
249,INTRODUCTION,His mater is worth gold
250,INTRODUCTION,And worthy to be enrold.’
251,INTRODUCTION,
252,INTRODUCTION,Barclay in the Preface of his _Mirour of Good Manners_ (printed
253,INTRODUCTION,"1516) states that he has been desired by his ‘Master,’ Sir"
254,INTRODUCTION,"Giles Alington, to abridge and amend the _Confessio Amantis_,"
255,INTRODUCTION,"but has declined the task, chiefly on moral grounds. The work"
256,INTRODUCTION,he says would not be suitable to his age and order (he was a
257,INTRODUCTION,"priest and monk of Ely),"
258,INTRODUCTION,
259,INTRODUCTION,"‘And though many passages therin be commendable,"
260,INTRODUCTION,Some processes appeare replete with wantonnes:
261,INTRODUCTION,.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
262,INTRODUCTION,"For age it is a folly and jeopardie doubtlesse,"
263,INTRODUCTION,"And able for to rayse bad name contagious,"
264,INTRODUCTION,"To write, reade or commen of thing venerious.’"
265,INTRODUCTION,
266,INTRODUCTION,Leland had some glimmering perception of the difference between
267,INTRODUCTION,Chaucer and Gower in literary merit; but Bale suggests that our
268,INTRODUCTION,"author was ‘alter Dantes ac Petrarcha’ (no less), adding the"
269,INTRODUCTION,"remark, taken perhaps from Berthelette’s preface, ‘sui temporis"
270,INTRODUCTION,lucerna habebatur ad docte scribendum in lingua vulgari[A].’
271,INTRODUCTION,In Bullein’s _Dialogue against the Fever Pestilence_ (1564)
272,INTRODUCTION,"Gower is represented as sitting next to the Classical poets,"
273,INTRODUCTION,"Homer, Hesiod, Ennius and Lucan. Puttenham in the _Art of"
274,INTRODUCTION,"English Poesie_ (1589), and Sidney in the _Defence of Poesie_"
275,INTRODUCTION,"(1595), equally class Gower and Chaucer together. The latter,"
276,INTRODUCTION,illustrating his thesis that the first writers of each country
277,INTRODUCTION,"were the poets, says, ‘So among the Romans were Livius"
278,INTRODUCTION,"Andronicus and Ennius, so in the Italian language ... the"
279,INTRODUCTION,"poets Dante, Boccace and Petrarch, so in our English, Gower"
280,INTRODUCTION,"and Chaucer, after whom, encouraged and delighted with their"
281,INTRODUCTION,"excellent foregoing, others have followed to beautify our"
282,INTRODUCTION,"mother tongue, as well in the same kind as in other arts.’"
283,INTRODUCTION,
284,INTRODUCTION,"In Robert Greene’s _Vision_, printed about 1592, Chaucer and"
285,INTRODUCTION,Gower appear as the accepted representatives of the pleasant
286,INTRODUCTION,"and the sententious styles in story-telling, and compete"
287,INTRODUCTION,"with one another in tales upon a given subject, the cure of"
288,INTRODUCTION,"jealousy. The introduction of Gower into the play of _Pericles,"
289,INTRODUCTION,Prince of Tyre_ has already been referred to.
290,INTRODUCTION,
291,INTRODUCTION,"The uncritical exaggeration of Gower’s literary merits, which formerly"
292,INTRODUCTION,"prevailed, has been of some disadvantage to him in modern times. The"
293,INTRODUCTION,"comparison with Chaucer, which was so repeatedly suggested, could not"
294,INTRODUCTION,"but be unfavourable to him; and modern critics, instead of endeavouring"
295,INTRODUCTION,"to appreciate fairly such merits as he has, have often felt called upon"
296,INTRODUCTION,"to offer him up as a sacrifice to the honour of Chaucer, who assuredly"
297,INTRODUCTION,needs no such addition to his glory. The true critical procedure is
298,INTRODUCTION,rather the opposite of this. Gower’s early popularity and reputation
299,INTRODUCTION,"are facts to be reckoned with, in addition to the literary merit which"
300,INTRODUCTION,"we in our generation may find in his work, and neither students of"
301,INTRODUCTION,"Middle English, nor those who aim at tracing the influences under which"
302,INTRODUCTION,the English language and literature developed during the fifteenth and
303,INTRODUCTION,"sixteenth centuries, can afford to leave Gower’s English work out of"
304,INTRODUCTION,their account.

306,INTRODUCTION,
307,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,THE ENGLISH WORKS.
308,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
309,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,i. LITERARY CHARACTERISTICS.--The reason of the success of the
310,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,_Confessio Amantis_ was naturally the fact that it supplied a popular
311,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,need. After endeavouring to ‘give an account of his stewardship’
312,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"in various ways as a moralist, the author at length found his true"
313,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"vocation, and this time happily in his native tongue, as a teller of"
314,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"stories. The rest is all machinery, sometimes poetical and interesting,"
315,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"sometimes tiresome and clumsy, but the stories are the main thing. The"
316,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,perception of the popular taste may have come to him partly through the
317,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"success of Chaucer in the _Legend of Good Women_, and the simple but"
318,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,excellent narrative style which he thereupon developed must have been
319,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,a new revelation of his powers to himself as well as to others. It is
320,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"true that he does not altogether drop the character of the moralist,"
321,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,but he has definitely and publicly resigned the task of setting society
322,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"generally to rights,"
323,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
324,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,‘It stant noght in my sufficance
325,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"So grete thinges to compasse,"
326,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
327,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Forthi the Stile of my writinges
328,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Fro this day forth I thenke change
329,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"And speke of thing is noght so strange,’ &c. (i. 4 ff.)"
330,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
331,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,He covers his retreat indeed by dwelling upon the all-pervading
332,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,influence of Love in the world and the fact that all the evils of
333,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,society may be said to spring from the want of it; but this is little
334,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,more than a pretext. Love is the theme partly because it supplies
335,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"a convenient framework for the design, and partly perhaps out of"
336,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,deference to a royal command. There is no reason to doubt the statement
337,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,in the first version of the Prologue about the meeting of the author
338,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"with Richard II on the river, and that he then received suggestions for"
339,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"a book, which the king promised to accept and read. It may easily be"
340,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"supposed that Richard himself suggested love as the subject, being a"
341,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"matter in which, as we know from Froissart, he was apt to take delight."
342,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"‘Adont me demanda le roy de quoy il traittoit. Je luy dis, “D’amours.”"
343,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"De ceste response fut-il tous resjouys, et regarda dedens le livre en"
344,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,plusieurs lieux et y lisy[B].’ It was certainly to the credit of the
345,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,young king that he should have discerned literary merit in the work of
346,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the grave monitor who had so lectured him upon his duties in the _Vox
347,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Clamantis_, and should have had some part in encouraging him to set his"
348,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,hand to a more promising task; and if it be the fact that he suggested
349,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"love as the subject, we cannot but admire both the sense of humour"
350,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,displayed by the prince and the address with which our author acquitted
351,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,himself of the task proposed.
352,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
353,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,The idea of the Confession was no doubt taken from the _Roman de la
354,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Rose_, where the priest of Nature, whose name is Genius, hears her"
355,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,confession; but it must be allowed that Gower has made much better use
356,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,of it. Nature occupies herself in expounding the system of the universe
357,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"generally, and in confessing at great length not her own faults but"
358,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"those of Man, whom she repents of having made. Her tone is not at all"
359,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"that of a penitent, though she may be on her knees, and Genius does"
360,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,little or nothing for her in reply except to agree rather elaborately
361,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"with her view that, if proper precautions had been taken, Mars and"
362,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Venus might easily have outwitted Vulcan. Gower on the other hand has
363,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,made the Confession into a framework which will conveniently hold any
364,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"number of stories upon every possible subject, and at the same time"
365,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,he has preserved for the most part the due propriety of character
366,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,and situation in the two actors. By giving the scheme an apparent
367,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,limitation to the subject of love he has not in fact necessarily
368,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"limited the range of narrative, for there is no impropriety in"
369,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,illustrating by a tale the general nature of a vice or virtue before
370,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"making the special application to cases which concern lovers, and"
371,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"this special application, made with all due solemnity, has often a"
372,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,character of piquancy in which the moral tale pure and simple would be
373,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,wanting. Add to this that the form adopted tends itself to a kind of
374,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"quasi-religious treatment of the subject, which was fully in accordance"
375,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"with the taste of the day, and produces much of that impression of"
376,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,quaintness and charm with which we most of us associate our first
377,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,acquaintance with the _Confessio Amantis_.
378,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
379,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,The success of the work--for a success it is in spite of its
380,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,faults--is due to several merits. The first of these is the author’s
381,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,unquestionable talent for story-telling. He has little of the dramatic
382,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"power or the humour which distinguish Chaucer, but he tells his tales"
383,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"in a well-ordered and interesting manner, does not break the thread by"
384,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"digressions, never tires of the story before it is finished, as Chaucer"
385,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"does so obviously and so often, and carries his reader through with"
386,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,him successfully to the end in almost every case. His narrative is a
387,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"clear, if shallow, stream, rippling pleasantly over the stones and"
388,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,unbroken either by dams or cataracts. The materials of course are not
389,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"original, but Gower is by no means a slavish follower in detail of his"
390,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,authorities; the proportions and arrangement of the stories are usually
391,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,his own and often show good judgement. Moreover he not seldom gives a
392,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"fresh turn to a well-known story, as in the instances of Jephthah and"
393,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Saul, or makes a pretty addition to it, as is the case in some of the"
394,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,tales from Ovid. Almost the only story in which the interest really
395,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"flags is the longest, the tale of Apollonius of Tyre, which fills up"
396,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,so much of the eighth book and was taken as the basis of the plot of
397,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,_Pericles_; and this was in its original form so loose and rambling
398,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"a series of incidents, that hardly any skill could have completely"
399,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,redeemed it. There is no doubt that this gift of clear and interesting
400,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"narrative was the merit which most appealed to the popular taste, the"
401,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,wholesome appetite for stories being at that time not too well catered
402,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"for, and that the plainness of the style was an advantage rather than a"
403,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,drawback.
404,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
405,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Tastes will differ of course as to the merits of the particular
406,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"stories, but some may be selected as incontestably good. The tale of"
407,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Mundus and Paulina in the first book is excellently told, and so is"
408,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,that of Alboin and Rosemund. The best of the second book are perhaps
409,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the False Bachelor and the legend of Constantine and Silvester, in the"
410,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,latter of which the author has greatly improved upon his materials. In
411,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the third book the tale of Canace is most pathetically rendered, far"
412,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"better than in Ovid, so that in spite of Chaucer’s denunciation his"
413,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,devoted follower Lydgate could not resist the temptation of borrowing
414,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"it. The fourth book, which altogether is of special excellence, gives"
415,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"us Rosiphelee, Phyllis, and the very poetically told tale of Ceix and"
416,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Alceone. The fifth has Jason and Medea, a most admirable example of"
417,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"sustained narrative, simple and yet effective and poetical, perhaps"
418,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,on the whole Gower’s best performance: also the oriental tale of
419,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Adrian and Bardus, and the well told story of Tereus and Philomela."
420,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,In the seventh we shall find the Biblical story of Gideon excellently
421,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"rendered, the Rape of Lucrece, and the tale of Virginia. These may"
422,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"be taken as specimens of Gower’s narrative power at its best, and by"
423,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the degree of effectiveness which he attains in them and the manner
424,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"in which he has used his materials, he may fairly be judged as a"
425,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,story-teller.
426,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
427,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,As regards style and poetical qualities we find much that is good in
428,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the narratives. Force and picturesqueness certainly cannot be denied to
429,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the tale of Medea, with its description of the summer sea glistening"
430,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"in the sun, which blazes down upon the returning hero, and from the"
431,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,golden fleece by his side flashes a signal of success to Medea in her
432,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"watch-tower, as she prays for her chosen knight. Still less can we"
433,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,refuse to recognize the poetical power of the later phases of the same
434,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"story, first the midnight rovings of Medea in search of enchantments,"
435,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
436,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,‘The world was stille on every side;
437,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"With open hed and fot al bare,"
438,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Hir her tosprad sche gan to fare,"
439,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Upon hir clothes gert sche was,"
440,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Al specheles and on the gras
441,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Sche glod forth as an Addre doth:
442,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Non otherwise sche ne goth,"
443,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Til sche cam to the freisshe flod,"
444,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,And there a while sche withstod.
445,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Thries sche torned hire aboute,"
446,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,And thries ek sche gan doun loute

448,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,And thries on the water ther
449,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Sche gaspeth with a drecchinge onde,"
450,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"And tho sche tok hir speche on honde.’ (v. 3962 ff.),"
451,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
452,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"and again later, when the charms are set in action, 4059 ff., a"
453,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"passage of extraordinary picturesqueness, but too long to be quoted"
454,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"here. We do not forget the debt to Ovid, but these descriptions are far"
455,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,more detailed and forcible than the original.
456,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
457,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"For a picture of a different kind, also based upon Ovid, we may take"
458,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the description of the tears of Lucrece for her husband, and the"
459,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"reviving beauty in her face when he appears,"
460,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
461,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,‘With that the water in hire yhe
462,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Aros, that sche ne myhte it stoppe,"
463,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,And as men sen the dew bedroppe
464,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"The leves and the floures eke,"
465,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Riht so upon hire whyte cheke
466,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,The wofull salte teres felle.
467,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Whan Collatin hath herd hire telle

469,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Anon with that to hire he sterte,"
470,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"And seide, “Lo, mi goode diere,"
471,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Nou is he come to you hiere,"
472,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"That ye most loven, as ye sein.”"

474,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Beclipte him in hire armes smale,"
475,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"And the colour, which erst was pale,"
476,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"To Beaute thanne was restored,"
477,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"So that it myhte noght be mored’ (vii. 4830 ff.),"
478,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
479,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"a passage in which Gower, with his natural taste for simplicity, has"
480,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"again improved upon his classical authority, and may safely challenge"
481,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"comparison with Chaucer, who has followed Ovid more literally."
482,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
483,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,It is worth mention that Gower’s descriptions of storms at sea are
484,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"especially vivid and true, so that we are led to suppose that he had"
485,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,had more than a mere literary acquaintance with such things. Such for
486,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"instance is the account of the shipwreck of the Greek fleet, iii. 981"
487,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"ff., and of the tempests of which Apollonius is more than once the"
488,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"victim, as viii. 604 ff., and in general nautical terms and metaphors,"
489,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"of some of which the meaning is not quite clear, seem to come readily"
490,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,from his pen.
491,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
492,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Next to the simple directness of narrative style which distinguishes
493,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the stories themselves, we must acknowledge a certain attractiveness"
494,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,in the setting of them. The Lover decidedly engages our interest:
495,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"we can understand his sorrows and his joys, his depression when his"
496,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"mistress will not listen to the verses which he has written for her,"
497,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,and his delight when he hears men speak her praises. We can excuse
498,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"his frankly confessed envy, malice and hatred in all matters which"
499,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,concern his rivals in her love. His feelings are described in a very
500,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"natural manner, the hesitation and forgetfulness in her presence, and"
501,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the self-reproach afterwards, the eagerness to do her small services,"
502,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"to accompany her to mass, to lift her into her saddle, to ride by her"
503,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"carriage, the delight of being present in her chamber, of singing"
504,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"to her or reading her the tale of Troilus, or if no better may be,"
505,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,of watching her long and slender fingers at work on her weaving or
506,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"embroidery. Sometimes she will not stay with him, and then he plays"
507,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"with the dog or with the birds in the cage, and converses with the"
508,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,page of her chamber--anything as an excuse to stay; and when it grows
509,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"late and he must perforce depart, he goes indeed, but returns with"
510,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the pretence of having forgotten something, in order that he may bid"
511,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,her good-night once more. He rises in the night and looks out of his
512,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"window over the houses towards the chamber where she sleeps, and loses"
513,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,himself in imagination of the love-thefts which he would commit if by
514,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,any necromancy he had the power. Yet he is not extravagantly romantic:
515,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"he will go wherever his lady bids him, but he will not range the world"
516,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"in arms merely in order to gain renown, losing his lady perhaps in the"
517,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,meantime at home. We take his side when he complains of the Confessor’s
518,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"want of feeling for a pain which he does not himself experience, and"
519,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,his readiness to prescribe for a wound of the heart as if it were a
520,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"sore of the heel. Even while we smile, we compassionate the lover who"
521,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"is at last disqualified on account of age, and recommended to make a"
522,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,‘beau retret’ while there is yet time.
523,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
524,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"But there is also another character in whom we are interested, and"
525,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,that is the lady herself. Gower certainly appreciated something of the
526,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"delicacy and poetical refinement which ideal love requires, and this"
527,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,appreciation he shows also in his _Balades_; but here we have something
528,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"more than this. The figure of the lady, which we see constantly in the"
529,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"background of the dialogue, is both attractive and human. We recognize"
530,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"in her a creature of flesh and blood, no goddess indeed, as her lover"
531,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"himself observes, but a charming embodiment of womanly grace and"
532,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"refinement. She is surrounded by lovers, but she is wise and wary. She"
533,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"is courteous and gentle, but at the same time firm: she will not gladly"
534,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"swear, and therefore says nay without an oath, but it is a decisive"
535,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,nay to any who are disposed to presume. She does not neglect her
536,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"household duties merely because a lover insists upon hanging about her,"
537,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"but leaves him to amuse himself how he may, while she busies herself"
538,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"elsewhere. If she has leisure and can sit down to her embroidery, he"
539,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"may read to her if he will, but it must be some sound romance, and not"
540,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"his own rondels, balades, and virelays in praise of her. Custom allows"
541,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"him to kiss her when he takes his leave, but if he comes back on any"
542,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"pretext and takes his leave again, there is not often a second kiss"
543,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"permitted. She lets him lead her up to the offering in church, and"
544,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"ride by her side when she drives out, but she will take no presents"
545,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"from him, though with some of her younger admirers, whose passion she"
546,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"knows is a less serious matter, she is not so strict, but takes and"
547,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"gives freely. Even the description of her person is not offensive, as"
548,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,such descriptions almost always are. Her lover suspects that her soul
549,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"may be in a perilous state, seeing that she has the power of saving a"
550,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"man’s life and yet suffers him to die, but he admits there is no more"
551,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"violence in her than in a child of three years old, and her words are"
552,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,as pleasant to him as the winds of the South. Usurious dealing is a
553,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"vice of which he ventures to accuse her, seeing that he has given her"
554,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"his whole heart in return for a single glance of her eye, and she holds"
555,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"to the bargain and will not give heart for heart; but then, as the"
556,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Confessor very justly replies, ‘she may be such that her one glance is"
557,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"worth thy whole heart many times over,’ and so he has sold his heart"
558,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"profitably, having in return much more than it is worth."
559,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
560,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"However, the literary characteristic which is perhaps most remarkable"
561,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,in the _Confessio Amantis_ is connected rather with the form of
562,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,expression than with the subject-matter. No justice is done to Gower
563,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,unless it is acknowledged that the technical skill which he displays
564,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,in his verse and the command which he has over the language for his
565,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,own purposes is very remarkable. In the ease and naturalness of
566,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,his movement within the fetters of the octosyllabic couplet he far
567,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"surpasses his contemporaries, including Chaucer himself. Certain"
568,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,inversions of order and irregularities of construction he allows
569,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"himself, and there are many stop-gaps of the conventional kind in the"
570,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,ordinary flow of his narrative; but in places where the matter requires
571,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"it, his admirable management of the verse paragraph, the metrical"
572,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"smoothness of his lines, attained without unnatural accent or forced"
573,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"order of words, and the neatness with which he expresses exactly what"
574,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"he has to say within the precise limits which he lays down for himself,"
575,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,show a finished mastery of expression which is surprising in that age
576,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"of half-developed English style, and in a man who had trained himself"
577,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,rather in French and Latin than in English composition. Such a sentence
578,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"as the following, for example, seems to flow from him with perfect"
579,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"ease, there is no halting in the metre, no hesitation or inversion for"
580,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the sake of the rhyme, it expresses just what it has to express, no"
581,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,more and no less:
582,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
583,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"’Til that the hihe king of kinges,"
584,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Which seth and knoweth alle thinges,"
585,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Whos yhe mai nothing asterte,--"
586,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,The privetes of mannes herte
587,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Thei speke and sounen in his Ere
588,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"As thogh thei lowde wyndes were,--"
589,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,He tok vengance upon this pride.’ (i. 2803 ff.)
590,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
591,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Or again, as an example of a more colloquial kind,"
592,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
593,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,‘And if thei techen to restreigne
594,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Mi love, it were an ydel peine"
595,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,To lerne a thing which mai noght be.
596,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"For lich unto the greene tree,"
597,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"If that men toke his rote aweie,"
598,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Riht so myn herte scholde deie,"
599,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,If that mi love be withdrawe.’ (iv. 2677 ff.)
600,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
601,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,There is nothing remarkable about the sentiment or expression in
602,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"these passages, but they are perfectly simple and natural, and run"
603,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,into rhyming verse without disturbance of sense or accent; but such
604,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,technical skill as we have here is extremely rare among the writers of
605,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the time. Chaucer had wider aims, and being an artist of an altogether"
606,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"superior kind, he attains, when at his best, to a higher level of"
607,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,achievement in versification as in other things; but he is continually
608,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"attempting more than he can perform, he often aims at the million"
609,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,and misses the unit. His command over his materials is evidently
610,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"incomplete, and he has not troubled himself to acquire perfection of"
611,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"craftsmanship, knowing that other things are more important,"
612,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
613,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,‘And that I do no diligence
614,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,To shewe craft but o sentence.’
615,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
616,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,The result is that the most experienced reader often hesitates in his
617,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"metre and is obliged to read lines over twice or even thrice, before"
618,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,he can satisfy himself how the poet meant his words to be accented and
619,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"what exactly was the rhythm he intended. In fact, instead of smoothing"
620,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the way for his reader, he often deliberately chooses to spare himself"
621,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"labour by taking every advantage, fair or unfair, of those licences of"
622,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,accent and syllable suppression for which the unstable condition of
623,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the literary language afforded scope. The reader of Gower’s verse is
624,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,never interrupted in this manner except by the fault of a copyist or an
625,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,editor; and when we come to examine the means by which the smoothness
626,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"is attained, we feel that we have to do with a literary craftsman who"
627,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,by laborious training has acquired an almost perfect mastery over his
628,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,tools. The qualities of which we are speaking are especially visible
629,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"in the more formal style of utterance which belongs to the speeches,"
630,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,letters and epitaphs in our author’s tales. The reply of Constance to
631,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,her questioner (ii. 1148 ff.) is a good example of the first:
632,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
633,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"‘Quod sche, “I am"
634,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,A womman wofully bestad.
635,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"I hadde a lord, and thus he bad,"
636,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,That I forth with my litel Sone
637,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Upon the wawes scholden wone,"
638,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Bot what the cause was, I not:"
639,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Bot he which alle thinges wot
640,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Yit hath, I thonke him, of his miht"
641,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Mi child and me so kept upriht,"
642,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,That we be save bothe tuo.”’
643,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
644,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,And as longer instances we may point to the reflexions of the Emperor
645,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Constantine near the end of the same book (ii. 3243 ff.), and the"
646,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,prayer of Cephalus (iv. 3197-3252). The letters of Canace and of
647,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Penelope are excellent, each in its own way, and the epitaphs of Iphis"
648,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,(iv. 3674 ff.) and of Thaise (viii. 1533 ff.) are both good examples of
649,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the simple yet finished style, e.g."
650,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
651,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"‘Hier lith, which slowh himself, Iphis,"
652,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,For love of Araxarathen:
653,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"And in ensample of tho wommen,"
654,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"That soffren men to deie so,"
655,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Hire forme a man mai sen also,"
656,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Hou it is torned fleissh and bon
657,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Into the figure of a Ston:
658,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,He was to neysshe and sche to hard.
659,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Be war forthi hierafterward;
660,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Ye men and wommen bothe tuo,"
661,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Ensampleth you of that was tho.’ (iv. 3674 ff.)
662,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
663,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"In a word, the author’s literary sphere may be a limited one, and his"
664,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,conception of excellence within that sphere may fall very far short
665,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"of the highest standard, but such as his ideals are, he is able very"
666,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,completely to realize them. The French and English elements of the
667,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"language, instead of still maintaining a wilful strife, as is so often"
668,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the case in Chaucer’s metre, are here combined in harmonious alliance."
669,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,More especially we must recognize the fact that in Gower’s English
670,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,verse we have a consistent and for the moment a successful attempt
671,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,to combine the French syllabic with the English accentual system of
672,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"metre, and this without sacrificing the purity of the language as"
673,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,regards forms of words and grammatical inflexion. We shall see in our
674,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,subsequent investigations how careful and ingenious he is in providing
675,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,by means of elision and otherwise for the legitimate suppression of
676,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,those weak terminations which could not find a place as syllables in
677,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the verse without disturbing its accentual flow, while at the same time"
678,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the sense of their existence was not to be allowed to disappear. The
679,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,system was too difficult and complicated to be possible except for a
680,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"specially trained hand, and Gower found no successor in his enterprise;"
681,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,but the fact that the attempt was made is at least worthy of note.
682,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
683,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,With considerable merits both of plan and execution the _Confessio
684,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Amantis_ has also no doubt most serious faults. The scheme itself,"
685,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,with its conception of a Confessor who as priest has to expound a
686,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"system of morality, while as a devotee of Venus he is concerned only"
687,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"with the affairs of love (i. 237-280), can hardly be called altogether"
688,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,a consistent or happy one. The application of morality to matters
689,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"of love and of love to questions of morality is often very forced,"
690,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,though it may sometimes be amusing in its gravity. The Confessor is
691,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"continually forgetting one or the other of his two characters, and the"
692,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,moralist is found justifying unlawful love or the servant of Venus
693,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,singing the praises of virginity. Moreover the author did not resist
694,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the temptation to express his views on society in a Prologue which
695,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,is by no means sufficiently connected with the general scheme of the
696,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"poem, though it is in part a protest against division and discord,"
697,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"that is to say, lack of love. Still worse is the deliberate departure"
698,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"from the general plan which we find in the seventh book, where on"
699,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"pretence of affording relief and recreation to the wearied penitent,"
700,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the Confessor, who says that he has little or no understanding except"
701,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"of love, is allowed to make a digression which embraces the whole"
702,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"field of human knowledge, but more especially deals with the duties of"
703,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"a king, a second political pamphlet in fact, in which the stories of"
704,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"kings ruined by lust or insolence, of Sardanapalus, Rehoboam, Tarquin,"
705,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"and the rest, are certainly intended to some extent as an admonition of"
706,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the author’s royal patron. The petition addressed to Rehoboam by his
707,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,people against excessive taxation reads exactly like one of the English
708,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,parliamentary protests of the period against the extravagant demands
709,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"of the crown. Again, the fifth book, which even without this would be"
710,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"disproportionately long, contains an absolutely unnecessary account of"
711,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the various religions of the world, standing there apparently for no"
712,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"reason except to show the author’s learning, and reaching the highest"
713,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,pitch of grotesque absurdity when the Confessor occupies himself in
714,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"demolishing the claim of Venus to be accounted a goddess, and that too"
715,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,without even the excuse of having forgotten for the moment that he is
716,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,supposed to be her priest. Minor excrescences of the same kind are to
717,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"be found in the third book, where the lawfulness of war is discussed,"
718,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"and in the fourth, where there is a dissertation on the rise of the"
719,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Arts, and especially of Alchemy. All that can be said is that these"
720,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,digressions were very common in the books of the age--the _Roman de
721,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"la Rose_, at least in the part written by Jean de Meun, is one of the"
722,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,worst offenders.
723,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
724,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Faults of detail it would be easy enough to point out. The style is
725,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"at times prosaic and the matter uninteresting, the verse is often eked"
726,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,out with such commonplace expressions and helps to rhyme as were used
727,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"by the writers of the time, both French or English. Sometimes the"
728,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,sentences are unduly spun out or the words and clauses are awkwardly
729,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,transposed for the sake of the uninterrupted smoothness of the verse.
730,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"The attainment of this object moreover is not always an advantage, and"
731,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,sometimes the regularity of the metre and the inevitable recurrence of
732,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the rhyme produces a tiresome result. On the whole however the effect
733,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"is not unpleasing, ‘the ease and regularity with which the verse flows"
734,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"breathes a peaceful contentment, which communicates itself to the"
735,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"reader, and produces the same effect upon the ear as the monotonous"
736,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"but not wearisome splashing of a fountain[C].’ Moreover, as has"
737,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"already been pointed out, when the writer is at his best, the rhyme is"
738,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"kept duly in the background, and the paragraph is constructed quite"
739,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"independently of the couplet, so that this form of metre proves often"
740,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,to be a far better vehicle for the narrative than might have been at
741,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,first supposed.
742,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
743,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
744,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,ii. DATE AND CIRCUMSTANCES.--The _Confessio Amantis_ in its earliest
745,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"form bears upon the face of it the date 1390 (Prol. 331 _margin_)[D],"
746,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,and we have no reason to doubt that this was the year in which it was
747,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,first completed. The author tells us that it was written at the command
748,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"of King Richard II, whom he met while rowing on the Thames at London,"
749,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,and who invited him to come into his barge to speak with him. It is
750,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"noticeable, however, that even this first edition has a dedication to"
751,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Henry earl of Derby, contained in the Latin lines at the end of the"
752,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"poem[E], so that it is not quite accurate to say that the dedication"
753,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"was afterwards changed, but rather that this dedication was made more"
754,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"prominent and introduced into the text of the poem, while at the same"
755,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,time the personal reference to the king in the Prologue was suppressed.
756,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"If the date referred to above had been observed by former editors,"
757,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the speculations first of Pauli and then of Professor Hales, tending"
758,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,to throw back the completion of the first recension of the _Confessio
759,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Amantis_ to the year 1386, or even 1383, would have been spared. Their"
760,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"conclusions rest, moreover, on the purest guess-work. The former argues"
761,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,that the preface and the epilogue[F] in their first form date from
762,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the year 1386, because from that year the king (who was then nineteen"
763,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,years old) ‘developed those dangerous qualities which estranged from
764,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"him, amongst others, the poet’; and Professor Hales (_Athenæum_, Dec."
765,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,1881) contends that the references to the young king’s qualities as a
766,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"ruler, ‘Justice medled with pite,’ &c. certainly point to the years"
767,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,immediately succeeding the Peasants’ revolt (a time when Gower did not
768,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"regard him as a responsible ruler at all, but excuses him for the evil"
769,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"proceedings of the government on account of his tender age)[G], that"
770,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the reference to Richard’s desire to establish peace (viii. 3014* ff.)
771,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,_must_ belong to the period of the negotiations with the French and
772,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the subsequent truce, 1383-84, though Professor Hales is himself quite"
773,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"aware that negotiations for peace were proceeding also in 1389, and"
774,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,finally that the mention of ‘the newe guise of Beawme’ must indicate
775,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the very year succeeding the king’s marriage to Anne of Bohemia in
776,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"1382, whereas in fact the Bohemian fashions would no doubt continue to"
777,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"prevail at court, and still be accounted new, throughout the queen’s"
778,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,lifetime. It is on such grounds as these that we are told that the
779,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,_Confessio Amantis_ in its first form _cannot_ have been written later
780,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,than the year 1385 and was probably as early as 1383.
781,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
782,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,All such conjectures are destroyed by the fact that the manuscripts of
783,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the first recension bear the date 1390 at the place cited, and though"
784,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,this does not absolutely exclude a later date for the completion of the
785,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"book, it is decisive against an earlier one. Moreover, the fact that in"
786,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the final recension this date is omitted (and deliberately omitted, as"
787,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,we know from the erasure in the Fairfax MS.) points to the conclusion
788,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"that it is to be regarded definitely as a date of publication, and"
789,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,therefore was inappropriate for a later edition.
790,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
791,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"This conclusion agrees entirely with the other indications, and they"
792,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"are sufficiently precise, though the fact that one of these also"
793,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,has unluckily escaped the notice of the editors has caused it to be
794,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,generally overlooked[H].
795,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
796,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,The form of epilogue which was substituted for that of the first
797,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"recension, and in which the over-sanguine praise of Richard as a ruler"
798,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"is cancelled, bears in the margin the date of the fourteenth year of"
799,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"his reign (viii. 2973 _margin_), ‘Hic in anno quarto decimo Regis"
800,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Ricardi orat pro statu regni,’ &c. Now the fourteenth year of King"
801,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Richard II was from June 21, 1390, to the same day of 1391. We must"
802,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"therefore suppose that the change in this part of the book took place,"
803,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"in some copies at least, within a few months of its first completion."
804,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
805,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Thirdly, we have an equally precise date for the alteration in the"
806,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Prologue, by which all except a formal mention of Richard II is"
807,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"excluded, while the dedication to Henry of Lancaster is introduced into"
808,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the text of the poem; and here the time indicated is the sixteenth year
809,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"of King Richard (Prol. 25), a date which appears also in the margin of"
810,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"some copies here and at l. 97, so that we may assume that this final"
811,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"change of form took place in the year 1392-93, that is, not later than"
812,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,June 1393.
813,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
814,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Having thus every step dated for us by the author, we may, if we think"
815,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"it worth while, proceed to conjecture what were the political events"
816,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,which suggested his action; but in such a case as this it is evidently
817,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"preposterous to argue first from the political conditions, of which as"
818,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,they personally affected our author and his friends we can only be very
819,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"imperfectly informed, and then to endeavour to force the given dates"
820,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,into accordance with our own conclusions[I].
821,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
822,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,It will be observed from the above dates that we are led to infer two
823,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"stages of alteration, and the expectation is raised of finding the poem"
824,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,in some copies with the epilogue rewritten but the preface left in its
825,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,original state. This expectation is fulfilled. The Bodley MS. 294 gives
826,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"a text of this kind, and it is certain that there were others of the"
827,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"same form, for Berthelette used for his edition a manuscript of this"
828,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"kind, which was not identical with that which we have."
829,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
830,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,In discussing the import of the various changes introduced by the
831,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,author it is of some importance to bear in mind the fact already
832,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,mentioned that even the first issue of the _Confessio Amantis_ had a
833,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,kind of dedication to Henry of Lancaster in the Latin lines with which
834,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"it concluded,"
835,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
836,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"‘Derbeie comiti, recolunt quem laude periti,"
837,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Vade liber purus sub eo requiesce futurus.’
838,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
839,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,This seems rather to dispose of the idea that a dedication to Henry
840,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"would be inconsistent with loyalty to Richard, a suggestion which would"
841,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"hardly have been made in the year 1390, or even 1393. No doubt those"
842,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,copies which contained in the preface the statement that the book
843,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"was written at the command of the king and for his sake, and in the"
844,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"epilogue the presentation of the completed book to him (3050* ff.),"
845,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,if they had also appended to them the Latin lines which commend the
846,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"work to the earl of Derby, may be said to have contained in a certain"
847,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"sense a double dedication, the compliment being divided between the"
848,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"king and his brilliant cousin, and very probably a copy which was"
849,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"intended for the court would be without the concluding lines, as we"
850,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,find to be the case with some manuscripts; but the suggestion that the
851,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,expressions of loyalty and the praises of Richard as a ruler which
852,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,we find in the first epilogue are properly to be called inconsistent
853,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"with a dedication of the poem to Henry of Lancaster, his cousin and"
854,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"counsellor, is plausible only in the light of later events, which"
855,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"could not be foreseen by the poet, in the course of which Henry became"
856,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,definitely the opponent of Richard and finally took the lead in
857,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,deposing him. It is true that the earl of Derby had been one of the
858,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"lords appellant in 1387, but after the king’s favourites had been set"
859,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"aside, he was for the time reconciled to Richard, and he could not in"
860,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"any sense be regarded as the leader of an opposition party. That Gower,"
861,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"when he became disgusted with Richard II, should have set Henry’s"
862,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"name in the Prologue in place of that of the king, as representing"
863,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"his ideal of knighthood and statesmanship, may be regarded either as"
864,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"a coincidence with the future events, or as indicating that Gower had"
865,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,some discrimination in selecting a possible saviour of society; but it
866,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,is certain that at this time the poet can have had no definite idea
867,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,that his hero would become a candidate for the throne.
868,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
869,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,The political circumstances of the period during which the _Confessio
870,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Amantis_ was written and revised are not very easy to disentangle. We
871,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"may take it as probable that the plan of its composition, under the"
872,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,combined influence of Chaucer’s _Legend of Good Women_[J] and of the
873,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"royal command, may have been laid about the year 1386. Before this time"
874,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Richard would scarcely have been regarded by Gower as responsible for
875,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the government, and he would naturally look hopefully upon the young"
876,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"sovereign, then just entering upon his duties, as one who with proper"
877,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,admonition and due choice of advisers might turn out to be a good
878,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,ruler. During the succeeding years the evil counsellors of the king
879,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"were removed by the action of the lords appellant and the Parliament,"
880,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,and in the year 1389 a moderate and national policy seemed to have been
881,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"finally adopted by the king, with William of Wykeham as Chancellor"
882,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"and the young earl of Derby, who had been one of the appellants but"
883,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"had quarrelled with his uncle Gloucester, among the king’s trusted"
884,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,advisers. By the light of subsequent events Gower condemned the whole
885,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"behaviour of the king during this period as malicious and treacherous,"
886,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"but this could hardly have been his judgement of it at the time, for"
887,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Richard’s dissimulation, if dissimulation it were, was deep enough"
888,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"to deceive all parties. Consequently, up to the year 1390 at least,"
889,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"he may have continued, though with some misgivings, to trust in"
890,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the king’s good intentions and to regard him as a ruler who might
891,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"effectually heal the divisions of the land, as he had already taken"
892,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,steps to restore peace to it outwardly. It is quite possible also that
893,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,something may have come to his knowledge in the course of the year
894,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"1390-91 which shook his faith. It was at this time, in July 1390, just"
895,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"at the beginning of the fourteenth year of King Richard, that his"
896,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,hero the earl of Derby left the court and the kingdom to exercise his
897,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"chivalry in Prussia, and for this there may have been a good reason."
898,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,We know too little in detail of the events of the year to be able to
899,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,say exactly what causes of jealousy may have arisen between the king
900,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"and his cousin, who was nearly exactly of an age with him and seems to"
901,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,have attracted much more attention than Richard himself at the jousts
902,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,of St. Inglevert in May of this year. Whatever feeling there may have
903,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,been on the side of the earl of Derby would doubtless reflect itself
904,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"in the minds of his friends and supporters, and something of this kind"
905,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,may have deepened into certitude the suspicions which Gower no doubt
906,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,already had in his heart of the ultimate intentions of Richard II. The
907,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,result was that in some copies at least of the _Confessio Amantis_ the
908,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,concluding praises of the king as a ruler were removed and lines of a
909,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,more general character on the state of the kingdom and the duties of
910,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"a king were substituted, but still there was no mention of the earl"
911,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"of Derby except as before in the final Latin lines. Two years later,"
912,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"1392-93, when the earl of Derby had fairly won his spurs and at the age"
913,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"of twenty-five might be regarded as a model of chivalry, the mention of"
914,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Richard as the suggester of the work was removed, and the name of Henry"
915,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,set in the text as the sole object of the dedication.
916,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
917,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"The date sixteenth year must certainly be that of this last change,"
918,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,but the occasion doubtless was the sending of a presentation copy to
919,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Henry, and this would hardly amount to publication. The author probably"
920,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,did not feel called upon publicly to affront the king by removing
921,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"his name and praises, either at the beginning or the end, from the"
922,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,copies generally issued during his reign. Whether or not this conduct
923,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"justifies the charge of time-serving timidity, which has been made"
924,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"against Gower, I cannot undertake to decide. He was, however, in fact"
925,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"rather of an opposite character, even pedantically stiff in passing"
926,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"judgement severely on those in high places, and not bating a syllable"
927,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"of what he thought proper for himself to say or for a king to hear,"
928,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,though while the king was young and might yet shake himself free from
929,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,evil influences he was willing to take as favourable a view of his
930,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,character as possible. Probably he was for some time rather in two
931,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"minds about the matter, but in any case ‘timid and obsequious’ are"
932,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,hardly the right epithets for the author of the _Vox Clamantis_.
933,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
934,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Before leaving this subject something should perhaps be said upon a
935,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"matter which has attracted no little attention, namely the supposed"
936,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,quarrel between the author of the _Confessio Amantis_ and Chaucer.
937,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,It is well known that the first recension of our poem has a passage
938,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"referring to Chaucer in terms of eulogy (viii. 2941*-57*), and that"
939,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,this was omitted when the epilogue was rewritten. This fact has been
940,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,brought into connexion with the apparent reference to Gower in the
941,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"_Canterbury Tales_, where the Man of Law in the preamble to his tale"
942,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,disclaims on Chaucer’s behalf such ‘cursed stories’ as those of Canace
943,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"and Apollonius, because they treat of incest. It has been thought that"
944,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"this was meant for a serious attack on Gower, and that he took offence"
945,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,at it and erased the praise of Chaucer from the _Confessio Amantis_.
946,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
947,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,It is known of course that the two poets were on personally friendly
948,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"terms, not only from the dedication of _Troilus_, but from the fact"
949,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"that when Chaucer was sent on a mission to the Continent in 1378, he"
950,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,appointed Gower one of his attorneys in his absence. It is possible
951,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"that their friendship was interrupted by a misunderstanding, but it may"
952,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,be doubted whether there is sufficient proof of this in the facts which
953,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,have been brought forward.
954,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
955,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,In the first place I question whether Chaucer’s censure is to be taken
956,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"very seriously. That it refers to Gower I have little doubt, but that"
957,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the attack was a humorous one is almost equally clear. Chaucer was
958,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,aware that some of his own tales were open to objection on the score
959,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"of morality, and when he saw a chance of scoring a point on the very"
960,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"ground where his friend thought himself strongest, he seized it with"
961,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"readiness. Some degree of seriousness there probably is, for Chaucer’s"
962,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,sound and healthy view of life instinctively rejected the rather morbid
963,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,horrors to which he refers; but it may easily be suspected that he was
964,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"chiefly amused by the opportunity of publicly lecturing the moralist,"
965,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,who perhaps had privately remonstrated with him[K]. As to the notion
966,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,that Chaucer had been seriously offended by the occasional and very
967,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,trifling resemblances of phrase in Gower’s tale of Constance with his
968,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"own version of the same original, it is hardly worth discussion."
969,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
970,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,There is of course the possibility that Gower may have taken it more
971,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"seriously than it was meant, and though he was not quite so devoid of"
972,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"a sense of humour as it has been the fashion to suppose[L], yet he"
973,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"may well have failed to enjoy a public attack, however humorous, upon"
974,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"two of his tales. It must be observed, however, that if we suppose"
975,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the passage in question to have been the cause of the excision of
976,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Gower’s lines about Chaucer, we must assume that the publication of it"
977,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,took place precisely within this period of a few months which elapsed
978,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,between the first and the second versions of Gower’s epilogue.
979,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,
980,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,Before further considering the question as to what was actually our
981,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"author’s motive in omitting the tribute to his brother poet, we should"
982,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,do well to observe that this tribute was apparently allowed to stand in
983,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"some copies of the rewritten epilogue. There is one good manuscript,"
984,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"that in the possession of Lord Middleton, in which the verses about"
985,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"Chaucer not only stand in combination with the new form of epilogue,"
986,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"but in a text which has also the revised preface, dated two years"
987,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,later[M]. Hence it seems possible that the exclusion of the Chaucer
988,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"verses was rather accidental than deliberate, and from this and other"
989,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,considerations an explanation may be derived which will probably seem
990,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"too trivial, but nevertheless is perhaps the true one. We know from"
991,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,the Fairfax MS. of the _Confessio Amantis_ and from several original
992,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,copies of the _Vox Clamantis_ that the author’s method of rewriting
993,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"his text was usually to erase a certain portion, sometimes a whole"
994,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"column or page, and substitute a similar number of lines of other"
995,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"matter. It will be observed here that for the thirty lines 2941*-2970*,"
996,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"including the reference to Chaucer, are substituted thirty lines from"
997,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,which that reference is excluded. After this come four Latin lines
998,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"replacing an equal number in the original recension, and then follow"
999,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"fifteen lines, 2971-2985, which are the same except a single line in"
1000,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the two editions. It may be that the author, wishing to mention the"
1001,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,departure of the Confessor and the thoughts which he had upon his
1002,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"homeward way, sacrificed the Chaucer verses as an irrelevance, in order"
1003,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,to find room for this matter between the Adieu of Venus and the lines
1004,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"beginning ‘He which withinne daies sevene,’ which he did not intend to"
1005,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"alter, and that this proceeding, carried out upon a copy of the first"
1006,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"recension which has not come down to us, determined the general form"
1007,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"of the text for the copies with epilogue rewritten, though in a few"
1008,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,instances care was taken to combine the allusion to Chaucer with the
1009,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,other alterations. Such an explanation as this would be in accord with
1010,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"the methods of the author in some other respects; for, as we shall see"
1011,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"later on, the most probable explanation of the omission in the third"
1012,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"recension of the additional passages in the fifth and seventh books,"
1013,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,is that a first recension copy was used in a material sense as a basis
1014,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,"for the third recension text, and it was therefore not convenient to"
1015,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,introduce alterations which increased the number of lines in the body
1016,THE ENGLISH WORKS.,of the work.

1022,PROLOGUS.,PROLOGUS.
1023,PROLOGUS.,
1024,PROLOGUS.,1-92. PREFACE. By the books of those that were before us we are
1025,PROLOGUS.,"instructed, and therefore it is good that we also should write"
1026,PROLOGUS.,something which may remain after our days. But to write of wisdom only
1027,PROLOGUS.,is not good. I would rather go by the middle path and make a book of
1028,PROLOGUS.,"pleasure and profit both: and since few write in English, my meaning"
1029,PROLOGUS.,is to make a book[N] for England’s sake now in the sixteenth year of
1030,PROLOGUS.,King Richard. Things have changed and books are less beloved than in
1031,PROLOGUS.,"former days, but without them the fame and the example of the virtuous"
1032,PROLOGUS.,"would be lost. Thus I, simple scholar as I am, purpose to write a"
1033,PROLOGUS.,"book touching both upon the past and the present, and though I have"
1034,PROLOGUS.,"long been sick, yet I will endeavour as I may to provide wisdom for"
1035,PROLOGUS.,"the wise. For this prologue belongs all to wisdom, and by it the wise"
1036,PROLOGUS.,may recall to their memory the fortunes of the world; but after the
1037,PROLOGUS.,"prologue the book shall be of Love, which does great wonders among men."
1038,PROLOGUS.,Also I shall speak of the vices and virtues of rulers. But as my wit
1039,PROLOGUS.,"is too small to admonish every man, I submit my work for correction to"
1040,PROLOGUS.,"my own lord Henry of Lancaster, with whom my heart is in accord, and"
1041,PROLOGUS.,whom God has proclaimed the model of knighthood. God grant I may well
1042,PROLOGUS.,achieve the work which I have taken in hand.
1043,PROLOGUS.,
1044,PROLOGUS.,93-192. TEMPORAL RULERS. In the time past things went well: there was
1045,PROLOGUS.,"plenty and riches, with honour for noble deeds, and each estate kept"
1046,PROLOGUS.,its due place. Justice was upheld and the people obeyed their rulers.
1047,PROLOGUS.,Man’s heart was then shown in his face and his thought expressed by
1048,PROLOGUS.,"his words, virtue was exalted and vice abased. Now all is changed, and"
1049,PROLOGUS.,"above all discord and hatred have taken the place of love, there is no"
1050,PROLOGUS.,"stable peace, no justice and righteousness. All kingdoms are alike in"
1051,PROLOGUS.,"this, and heaven alone knows what is to be done. The sole remedy is"
1052,PROLOGUS.,that those who are the world’s guides should follow good counsel and
1053,PROLOGUS.,"should be obeyed by their people; and if king and council were at one,"
1054,PROLOGUS.,"it might be hoped that the war would be brought to an end, which is so"
1055,PROLOGUS.,much against the peace of Christ’s religion and from which no land gets
1056,PROLOGUS.,"any good. May God, who is above all things, give that peace of which"
1057,PROLOGUS.,the lands have need.
1058,PROLOGUS.,
1059,PROLOGUS.,193-498. THE CHURCH. Formerly the life of the clergy was an example to
1060,PROLOGUS.,"all, there was no simony, no disputes in the Church, no ambition for"
1061,PROLOGUS.,worldly honour. Pride was held a vice and humility a virtue. Alms were
1062,PROLOGUS.,given to the poor and the clergy gave themselves to preaching and to
1063,PROLOGUS.,"prayer. Thus Christ’s faith was first taught, but now it is otherwise."
1064,PROLOGUS.,"Simony and worldly strife prevail; and if priests take part in wars, I"
1065,PROLOGUS.,know not who shall make the peace. But heaven is far and the world is
1066,PROLOGUS.,"near, and they regard nothing but vainglory and covetousness, so that"
1067,PROLOGUS.,"the tithe goes at once to the war, as though Christ could not do them"
1068,PROLOGUS.,right by other ways. That which should bring salvation to the world is
1069,PROLOGUS.,"now the cause of evil: the prelates are such as Gregory wrote of, who"
1070,PROLOGUS.,"desire a charge in order that they may grow rich and great, and the"
1071,PROLOGUS.,faith is hindered thereby. Ambition and avarice have destroyed charity;
1072,PROLOGUS.,Sloth is their librarian and delicacy has put away their abstinence.
1073,PROLOGUS.,"Moreover Envy everywhere burns in the clergy like the fire of Etna,"
1074,PROLOGUS.,as we may see now [in this year of grace 1390] at Avignon. To see the
1075,PROLOGUS.,Church thus fall between two stools is a cause of sorrow to us all:
1076,PROLOGUS.,God grant that it may go well at last with him who has the truth. But
1077,PROLOGUS.,"as a fire spreads while men are slothfully drinking, so this schism"
1078,PROLOGUS.,"causes the new sect of Lollardy to spring up, and many another heresy"
1079,PROLOGUS.,among the clergy themselves. It were better to dike and delve and have
1080,PROLOGUS.,"the true faith, than to know all that the Bible says and err as some"
1081,PROLOGUS.,of these do. If men had before their eyes the virtues which Christ
1082,PROLOGUS.,"taught, they would not thus dispute about the Papacy. Each one attends"
1083,PROLOGUS.,"to his own profit, but none to the general cause of the Church, and"
1084,PROLOGUS.,"thus Christ’s fold is broken and the flock is devoured. The shepherds,"
1085,PROLOGUS.,"intent upon worldly good, wound instead of healing, and rob the sheep"
1086,PROLOGUS.,"unjustly of their wool. Nay, they drive them among the brambles, so"
1087,PROLOGUS.,that they may have the wool which the thorns tear off. If the wolf
1088,PROLOGUS.,"comes in the way, their staff is not at hand to defend the sheep,"
1089,PROLOGUS.,"but they are ready enough to smite the sheep with it, if they offend"
1090,PROLOGUS.,"ever so little. There are some indeed in whom virtue dwells, whom God"
1091,PROLOGUS.,"has called as Aaron was called, but most follow Simon at the heels,"
1092,PROLOGUS.,whose chariot rolls upon wheels of covetousness and pride. They teach
1093,PROLOGUS.,"how good it is to clothe and feed the poor, yet of their own goods"
1094,PROLOGUS.,they do not distribute. They say that chastity should be preserved by
1095,PROLOGUS.,"abstinence, but they eat daintily and lie softly, and whether they"
1096,PROLOGUS.,"preserve their chastity thereby, I dare not say: I hear tales, but I"
1097,PROLOGUS.,will not understand. Yet the vice of the evil-doers is no reproof to
1098,PROLOGUS.,"the good, for every man shall bear his own works."
1099,PROLOGUS.,
1100,PROLOGUS.,"499-584. THE COMMONS. As for the people, it is to be feared that that"
1101,PROLOGUS.,"may happen which has already come to pass in sundry lands, that they"
1102,PROLOGUS.,may break the bounds and overflow in a ruinous flood. Everywhere there
1103,PROLOGUS.,is lack of law and growth of error; all say that this world has gone
1104,PROLOGUS.,"wrong, and every one gives his judgement as to the cause; but he who"
1105,PROLOGUS.,"looks inwards upon himself will be ready to excuse his God, in whom"
1106,PROLOGUS.,there is no default. The cause of evil is in ourselves. Some say it is
1107,PROLOGUS.,"fortune and some the planets, but in truth all depends upon man. No"
1108,PROLOGUS.,"estate is secure, the fortune of it goes now up, now down, and all this"
1109,PROLOGUS.,is in consequence of man’s doings. In the Bible I find a tale which
1110,PROLOGUS.,"teaches that division is the chief cause why things may not endure,"
1111,PROLOGUS.,and that man himself is to blame for the changes which have overthrown
1112,PROLOGUS.,kingdoms.
1113,PROLOGUS.,
1114,PROLOGUS.,585-662. NABUGODONOSOR in a dream saw an image with the head and neck
1115,PROLOGUS.,"of gold, the breast and arms of silver, the belly and thighs of brass,"
1116,PROLOGUS.,"the legs of steel, and the feet of mixed steel and clay. On the feet of"
1117,PROLOGUS.,"this image fell a great stone which rolled down from a hill, and the"
1118,PROLOGUS.,image was destroyed. Daniel expounded this of the successive kingdoms
1119,PROLOGUS.,of the world.
1120,PROLOGUS.,
1121,PROLOGUS.,"663-880. These were the FOUR MONARCHIES, of Babylon, of Persia, of"
1122,PROLOGUS.,"the Greeks, and of the Romans. We are now in the last age, that of"
1123,PROLOGUS.,"dissension and division, as shown by the state of the Empire and the"
1124,PROLOGUS.,Papacy. This is that which was designated by the feet of the image.
1125,PROLOGUS.,
1126,PROLOGUS.,"881-1088. We are near to the end of the world, as the apostle tells"
1127,PROLOGUS.,us. The world stands now divided like the feet of the image. Wars are
1128,PROLOGUS.,"general, and yet the clergy preach that charity is the foundation of"
1129,PROLOGUS.,"all good deeds. Man is the cause of all the evil, and therefore the"
1130,PROLOGUS.,"image bore the likeness of a man. The heavenly bodies, the air and"
1131,PROLOGUS.,"the earth suffer change and corruption through the sin of man, who"
1132,PROLOGUS.,"is in himself a little world. When he is disordered in himself, the"
1133,PROLOGUS.,elements are all at strife with him and with each other. Division is
1134,PROLOGUS.,"the cause of destruction. So it is with man, who has within him diverse"
1135,PROLOGUS.,"principles which are at strife with one another, and in whom also"
1136,PROLOGUS.,"there is a fatal division between the body and the soul, which led to"
1137,PROLOGUS.,the fall from a state of innocence. The confusion of tongues at the
1138,PROLOGUS.,"building of the tower of Babel was a further cause of division, and"
1139,PROLOGUS.,"at last all peace and charity shall depart, and the stone shall fall."
1140,PROLOGUS.,"Thenceforward every man shall dwell either in heaven, where all is"
1141,PROLOGUS.,"peace, or in hell, which is full of discord."
1142,PROLOGUS.,
1143,PROLOGUS.,Would God that there were in these days any who could set peace on the
1144,PROLOGUS.,"earth, as Arion once by harping brought beasts and men into accord. But"

1151,LIB. I.,great a task is more than I am able to compass: I must let that alone
1152,LIB. I.,and treat of other things. Therefore I think to change from this time
1153,LIB. I.,"forth the style of my writings, and to speak of a matter with which all"
1154,LIB. I.,"the world has to do, and that is Love; wherein almost all are out of"
1155,LIB. I.,"rule and measure, for no man is able to resist it or to find a remedy"
1156,LIB. I.,for it. If there be anything in this world which is governed blindly by
1157,LIB. I.,"fortune, it is love: this is a game in which no man knows whether he"
1158,LIB. I.,"shall win or lose. I am myself one who belongs to this school, and I"

1163,LIB. I.,has chosen his mate and rejoices over the love which he has achieved;
1164,LIB. I.,but I was further off from mine than earth is from heaven. So to the
1165,LIB. I.,"wood I went, not to sing with the birds, but to weep and lament; and"
1166,LIB. I.,after a time I fell to the ground and wished for death. Then I looked
1167,LIB. I.,up to the heaven and prayed the god and the goddess of love to show me
1168,LIB. I.,"some grace. Anon I saw them; and he, the king of love, passed me by"
1169,LIB. I.,"with angry look and cast at me a fiery lance, which pierced through my"
1170,LIB. I.,"heart. But the queen remained, and asked me who I was, and bade me make"
1171,LIB. I.,known my malady. I told her that I had served her long and asked only
1172,LIB. I.,"my due wage, but she frowned and said that there were many pretenders,"
1173,LIB. I.,"who in truth had done no service, and bade me tell the truth and show"
1174,LIB. I.,"forth all my sickness. ‘That can I well do,’ I replied, ‘if my life"
1175,LIB. I.,"may last long enough.’ Then she looked upon me and said, ‘My will is"
1176,LIB. I.,first that thou confess thyself to my priest.’ And with that she called
1177,LIB. I.,"Genius, her priest, and he came forth and sat down to hear my shrift."
1178,LIB. I.,
1179,LIB. I.,203-288. This worthy priest bade me tell what I had felt for love’s
1180,LIB. I.,"sake, both the joy and the sorrow; and I fell down devoutly on my knees"
1181,LIB. I.,"and prayed him to question me from point to point, lest I should forget"
1182,LIB. I.,"things which concerned my shrift, for my heart was disturbed so that I"
1183,LIB. I.,could not myself direct my wits. He replied that he was there to hear
1184,LIB. I.,my confession and to question me: but he would not only speak of love;
1185,LIB. I.,for by his office of priest he was bound to set forth the moral vices.
1186,LIB. I.,"Yet he would show also the properties of Love, for he was retained in"
1187,LIB. I.,the service of Venus and knew little of other things. His purpose was
1188,LIB. I.,"to expound the nature of every vice, as it became a priest to do, and"
1189,LIB. I.,so to apply his teaching to the matter of love that I should plainly
1190,LIB. I.,understand his lore.

1192,LIB. I.,"289-574. SINS OF SEEING AND HEARING. I prayed him to say his will, and"
1193,LIB. I.,"I would obey, and he bade me confess as touching my five senses, which"
1194,LIB. I.,"are the gates through which things come into the heart, and first of"
1195,LIB. I.,"the principal and most perilous, the sense of sight. Many a man has"
1196,LIB. I.,"done mischief to love through seeing, and often the fiery dart of love"

1206,LIB. I.,them he was straightway turned into a stone. These were all killed by
1207,LIB. I.,"Perseus, to whom Pallas lent a shield with which he covered his face,"
1208,LIB. I.,and Mercury a sword with which he slew the monsters. (389-435.)
1209,LIB. I.,
1210,LIB. I.,"My priest therefore bade me beware of misusing my sight, lest I also"
1211,LIB. I.,should be turned to stone; and further he warned me to take good heed

1227,LIB. I.,From these examples (he said) I might learn how to keep the eye and

1344,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,of matchless beauty by his side. She stayed him till he should make
1345,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"his choice, whether he would have her thus by night or by day; and he,"
1346,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"despairing of an answer, left it to her to decide. By thus making her"
1347,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"his sovereign, he had broken the charm which bound her. She was the"

1386,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"alighted from his car and kissed their hands and feet, giving them alms"
1387,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,also. The lords of the land were displeased that the king should thus
1388,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"abase his royalty, and among them chiefly the king’s brother, who said"
1389,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"that he would rebuke the king for his deed. When they were returned,"
1390,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"the brother spoke to the king, and said he must excuse himself to his"

1395,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"death, this was sounded before his gate. The king then on that night"
1396,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"sent the man who had this office, to blow the trumpet at his brother’s"

1402,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"had been so moved by a mere human sentence of death, which might be"
1403,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"revoked. ‘Thou canst not now marvel,’ he said, ‘at that which I did:"
1404,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"for I saw in the pilgrims the image of my own death, as appointed by"
1405,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"God’s ordinance, and to this law I did obeisance; for compared to this"

1489,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,Then he heard a voice bidding to hew down the tree and destroy it; but
1490,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"the root (it said) should remain, and bear no man’s heart, but feed on"
1491,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"grass like an ox, till the water of the heaven should have washed him"

1493,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"could find none to interpret this dream, and sent therefore for Daniel."
1494,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"He said that the tree betokened the king, and that as the tree was"

1497,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"the greatness of God. The punishment was ordained, he said, for his"

1500,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,
1501,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,But Pride will not suffer humility to stand with him. Neither for his

1507,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"vowed to leave his vain glory, reaching up his feet towards the heaven,"
1508,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,kneeling and braying for mercy. Suddenly he was changed again into
1509,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"a man and received his power as before, and the pride of vain glory"

1517,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"and wise king, who delighted in propounding difficult questions, and"
1518,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,one knight of his court was so ready in answering them that the king
1519,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,conceived jealousy and resolved to put him to confusion. He bade him
1520,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,therefore answer these three questions on pain of death: (1) What is
1521,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,it that has least need and yet men help it most? (2) What is worth
1522,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,most and yet costs least? (3) What costs most and is worth least? The
1523,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"knight went home to consider, but the more he beat his brains, the more"
1524,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"he was perplexed. He had two daughters, the younger fourteen years of"
1525,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"age, who, perceiving his grief, entreated him to tell her the cause."
1526,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"At length he did so, and she asked to be allowed to answer for him"
1527,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"to the king. When the day came, they went together to the court, and"
1528,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"the knight left the answers to the maiden, at which all wondered. She"
1529,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"replied to the first question that it was the Earth, upon which men"
1530,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"laboured all the year round, and yet it had no need of help, being"
1531,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"itself the source of all life. As to the second, it was Humility,"
1532,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"through which God sent down his Son, and chose Mary above all others;"
1533,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"and yet this costs least to maintain, for it brings about no wars"
1534,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"among men. The third question, she said, referred to Pride, which cost"
1535,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"Lucifer and the rebel angels the loss of heaven, and Adam the loss of"
1536,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"paradise, and was the cause also of so many evils in the world."
1537,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,
1538,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"The king was satisfied, and looking on the maiden he said, ‘I like"
1539,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"thine answer well, and thee also, and if thou wert of lineage equal to"
1540,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"these lords, I would take thee for my wife. Ask what thou wilt of me"
1541,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"and thou shalt have it.’ She asked an earldom for her father, and this"
1542,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"granted, she thanked the king upon her knees, and claimed fulfilment of"
1543,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"his former word. Whatever she may have been once, she was now an earl’s"
1544,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"daughter, and he had promised to take her as his wife. The king, moved"
1545,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"by love, gave his assent, and thus it was. This king ruled Spain in old"
1546,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,"days and his name was Alphonse: the knight was called Don Petro, and"
1547,THE SEVEN DEADLY VICES.--PRIDE.,the daughter wise Peronelle. (3067-3402.)

1620,LIB. II.,

1622,LIB. II.,there be more.
1623,LIB. II.,
1624,LIB. II.,383-1871. DETRACTION. There is one of the brood of Envy called
1625,LIB. II.,"Detraction. He has Malebouche in his service, who cannot praise any"
1626,LIB. II.,without finding fault. He is like the beetle which flies over the
1627,LIB. II.,"fields, and cares nothing for the spring flowers, but makes his feast"
1628,LIB. II.,of such filth as he may find. So this envious jangler makes no mention
1629,LIB. II.,"of a man’s virtue, but if he find a fault he will proclaim it openly."
1630,LIB. II.,So also in Love’s court many envious tales are told. If thou hast made
1631,LIB. II.,"such janglery, my son, shrive thee thereof. (383-454.)"
1632,LIB. II.,
1633,LIB. II.,"Yes, father, but not openly. When I meet my dear lady and think of"
1634,LIB. II.,"those who come about her with false tales, all to deceive an innocent"
1635,LIB. II.,"(though she is wary enough and can well keep herself), my heart is"
1636,LIB. II.,envious and I tell the worst I know against them; and so I would
1637,LIB. II.,"against the truest and best of men, if he loved my lady; for I cannot"
1638,LIB. II.,endure that any should win there but I. This I do only in my lady’s
1639,LIB. II.,"ear, and above all I never tell any tale which touches her good name."
1640,LIB. II.,"Tell me then what penance I shall endure for this, for I have told you"
1641,LIB. II.,the whole truth.
1642,LIB. II.,
1643,LIB. II.,"My son, do so no more. Thy lady, as thou sayest, is wise and wary, and"
1644,LIB. II.,there is no need to tell her these tales. Moreover she will like thee
1645,LIB. II.,"the less for being envious, and often the evil which men plan towards"
1646,LIB. II.,others falls on themselves. Listen to a tale on this matter. (454-586.)
1647,LIB. II.,
1648,LIB. II.,_Tale of Constance._ The Roman Emperor Tiberius Constantinus had a
1649,LIB. II.,"daughter Constance, beautiful, wise, and full of faith. She converted"
1650,LIB. II.,"to Christianity certain merchants of Barbary, who came to Rome to"
1651,LIB. II.,"sell their wares, and they, being questioned by the Soldan when they"
1652,LIB. II.,"returned, so reported of Constance that he resolved to ask for her in"
1653,LIB. II.,"marriage. He sent to Rome and agreed to be converted, and Constance"
1654,LIB. II.,"was sent with two cardinals and many other lords, to be his bride. But"
1655,LIB. II.,the mother of the Soldan was moved by jealousy. She invited the whole
1656,LIB. II.,"company to a feast, and there slew her own son and all who had had to"
1657,LIB. II.,"do with the marriage except Constance herself, whom she ordered to be"
1658,LIB. II.,"placed alone in a rudderless ship with victuals for five years, and so"
1659,LIB. II.,to be committed to the winds and waves. (587-713.)
1660,LIB. II.,
1661,LIB. II.,"For three years she drifted under God’s guidance, and at last came"
1662,LIB. II.,"to land in Northumberland, near a castle on the bank of Humber, which"
1663,LIB. II.,"was kept by one Elda for the king of that land Allee, a Saxon and a"
1664,LIB. II.,worthy knight. Elda found her in the ship and committed her to the
1665,LIB. II.,"care of Hermyngheld his wife, who loved her and was converted by her."
1666,LIB. II.,"Hermyngheld in the name of Christ restored sight to a blind man,"
1667,LIB. II.,"at which all wondered, and Elda was converted to the faith. On the"
1668,LIB. II.,"morrow he rode to the king, and thinking to please him, who was then"
1669,LIB. II.,"unwedded, told him of Constance. The king said he would come and see"
1670,LIB. II.,"her. Elda sent before him a knight whom he trusted, and this knight"
1671,LIB. II.,"had loved Constance, but she had rejected him, so that his love was"
1672,LIB. II.,"turned to hate. When he came to the castle he delivered the message,"
1673,LIB. II.,and they prepared to receive the king; but in the night he cut the
1674,LIB. II.,throat of Hermyngheld and placed the bloody knife under the bed where
1675,LIB. II.,Constance lay. Elda came the same night and found his wife lying dead
1676,LIB. II.,and Constance sleeping by her. The false knight accused Constance and
1677,LIB. II.,"discovered the knife where he had placed it. Elda was not convinced,"
1678,LIB. II.,and the knight swore to her guilt upon a book. Suddenly the hand of
1679,LIB. II.,"heaven smote him and his eyes fell out of his head, and a voice bade"
1680,LIB. II.,"him confess the truth, which he did, and thereupon died. (714-885.)"
1681,LIB. II.,
1682,LIB. II.,"After this the king came, and desiring to wed Constance, agreed to"
1683,LIB. II.,receive baptism. So a bishop came from Bangor in Wales and christened
1684,LIB. II.,"him and many more, and married Constance to the king. She would not"
1685,LIB. II.,"tell who she was, but the king perceived that she was a noble creature."
1686,LIB. II.,"God visited her and she was with child, but the king was compelled to"
1687,LIB. II.,"go out on a war, and left his wife with Elda and the bishop. A son was"
1688,LIB. II.,"born and baptized by the name of Moris, and letters were written to the"
1689,LIB. II.,"king, and the bearer of them, who had to pass by Knaresborough, stayed"
1690,LIB. II.,there to tell the news to the king’s mother Domilde. She in the night
1691,LIB. II.,"changed the letters for others, which said, as from the keepers of the"
1692,LIB. II.,"queen, that she had been delivered of a monster. The messenger carried"
1693,LIB. II.,"the letters to the king, who wrote back that they should keep his wife"
1694,LIB. II.,carefully till he came again. On his return the messenger stayed again
1695,LIB. II.,"at Knaresborough, and Domilde substituted a letter bidding them on"
1696,LIB. II.,pain of death place Constance and her child in the same ship in which
1697,LIB. II.,"she had come, and commit them to the sea. They grieved bitterly, but"
1698,LIB. II.,obeyed. She prayed to heaven for help and devoted herself to the care
1699,LIB. II.,of the child (886-1083). After the end of that year the ship came to
1700,LIB. II.,"land near a castle in Spain, where a heathen admiral was lord, who"
1701,LIB. II.,"had a steward named Theloüs, a false renegade. He came to see the"
1702,LIB. II.,"ship and found Constance, but he let none else see her; and at night"
1703,LIB. II.,"he returned, thinking to have her at his will. He swore to kill her"
1704,LIB. II.,"if she resisted him, and she bade him look out at the port to see if"
1705,LIB. II.,any man was near: then on the prayer of Constance he was thrown out
1706,LIB. II.,"of the ship and drowned. A wind arose which took her from the land,"
1707,LIB. II.,and after three years she came to a place where a great navy lay. The
1708,LIB. II.,"lord of these ships questioned her, but she told him little, giving"
1709,LIB. II.,her name as Couste. He said that he came from taking vengeance on the
1710,LIB. II.,"Saracens for their treachery, but could hear no news of Constance. He"
1711,LIB. II.,was the Senator of Rome and was married to a niece of the Emperor named
1712,LIB. II.,Heleine. She came to Rome with her child and dwelt with his wife till
1713,LIB. II.,"twelve years were gone, and none knew what she was, but all loved her"
1714,LIB. II.,well. (1084-1225.)
1715,LIB. II.,
1716,LIB. II.,In the meantime king Allee discovered the treachery and took vengeance
1717,LIB. II.,"on his mother, who was burnt to death after confession of her guilt;"
1718,LIB. II.,and all said that she had well deserved her punishment and lamented for
1719,LIB. II.,"Constance. Having finished his wars, the king resolved to go to Rome"
1720,LIB. II.,"for absolution, and leaving Edwyn his heir to rule the land, he set"
1721,LIB. II.,forth with Elda. Arcennus reported to his wife and to Couste the coming
1722,LIB. II.,"of king Allee, and Couste swooned for joy. The king, after seeing the"
1723,LIB. II.,"Pope and relieving his conscience, made a feast, to which he invited"
1724,LIB. II.,"the Senator and others. Moris went also, and his mother bade him stand"
1725,LIB. II.,at the feast in sight of the king. The king seeing him thought him
1726,LIB. II.,"like his wife Constance, and loved him without knowing why. He asked"
1727,LIB. II.,"Arcennus if the child were his son, and from him he heard his story and"
1728,LIB. II.,"the name of his mother. The king smiled at the name ‘Couste,’ knowing"
1729,LIB. II.,"that it was Saxon for Constance, and was eager to ascertain the truth."
1730,LIB. II.,After the feast he besought the Senator to bring him home to see this
1731,LIB. II.,"Couste, and never man was more joyful than he was when he saw his wife."
1732,LIB. II.,(1226-1445.)
1733,LIB. II.,
1734,LIB. II.,"The king remained at Rome for a time with Constance, but still she"
1735,LIB. II.,did not tell him who she was. After a while she prayed him to make an
1736,LIB. II.,"honourable feast before he left the city and to invite the Emperor,"
1737,LIB. II.,who was at a place a few miles away from the city. Moris was sent
1738,LIB. II.,"to beseech him to come and eat with them, which request he granted;"
1739,LIB. II.,and at the time appointed they all went forth to meet the Emperor.
1740,LIB. II.,"Constance, riding forward to welcome him, made herself known to him as"
1741,LIB. II.,"his daughter. His heart was overcome, as if he had seen the dead come"
1742,LIB. II.,"to life again, and all present shed tears. So a parliament was held and"
1743,LIB. II.,Moris was named heir to the Emperor. King Allee and Constance returned
1744,LIB. II.,"home to the great joy of their land; but soon after this the king died,"
1745,LIB. II.,and Constance came again to Rome. After a short time the Emperor also
1746,LIB. II.,"died in her arms, and she herself in the next year following. Moris was"
1747,LIB. II.,crowned Emperor and known as ‘the most Christian.’ (1446-1598.)
1748,LIB. II.,
1749,LIB. II.,Thus love at last prevailed and the false tongues were silenced. Beware
1750,LIB. II.,"then thou of envious backbiting and lying, and if thou wouldest know"
1751,LIB. II.,"further what mischief is done by backbiting, hear now another tale."
1752,LIB. II.,(1599-1612.)
1753,LIB. II.,
1754,LIB. II.,"_Demetrius and Perseus._ Philip king of Macedoine had two sons,"
1755,LIB. II.,"Demetrius and Perseus. Demetrius the elder was the better knight, and"
1756,LIB. II.,he was heir to the kingdom; but Perseus had envy of him and slandered
1757,LIB. II.,"him to his father behind his back, saying that he had sold them to"
1758,LIB. II.,the Romans. Demetrius was condemned on suborned evidence and by a
1759,LIB. II.,"corrupt judge, and so put to death. Perseus then grew so proud that"
1760,LIB. II.,"he disdained his father and usurped his power, so that the father"
1761,LIB. II.,perceived the wrong which had been done; but the other party was so
1762,LIB. II.,"strong that he could not execute justice, and thus he died of grief."
1763,LIB. II.,
1764,LIB. II.,"Then Perseus took the government and made war on Rome, gathering a"
1765,LIB. II.,"great host. The Romans had a Consul named Paul Emilius, who took"
1766,LIB. II.,"this war in hand. His little daughter wept when she parted from him,"
1767,LIB. II.,"because her little dog named Perse was dead, and this seemed to him a"
1768,LIB. II.,"prognostic of success, for Perseus had spoken against his brother like"
1769,LIB. II.,"a dog barking behind a man’s back. Perseus rode with his host, not"
1770,LIB. II.,"foreseeing the mischief, and he lost a large part of his army by the"
1771,LIB. II.,breaking of the ice of the Danube. Paulus attacked him and conquered
1772,LIB. II.,"both him and his land, so that Perseus himself died like a dog in"
1773,LIB. II.,"prison, and his heir, who was exiled from his land, gained his bread by"
1774,LIB. II.,working at a craft in Rome. (1613-1861.)
1775,LIB. II.,
1776,LIB. II.,"Lo, my son, what evil is done by the Envy which endeavours to hinder"
1777,LIB. II.,another.

1780,LIB. II.,
1781,LIB. II.,"My son, there is a fourth, as deceptive as the guiles of a juggler, and"
1782,LIB. II.,this is called False Semblant. (1862-1878.)
1783,LIB. II.,
1784,LIB. II.,1879-2319. FALSE SEMBLANT. This is above all the spring from which
1785,LIB. II.,deceit flows. It seems fair weather on that flood; but it is not so
1786,LIB. II.,"in truth. False Semblant is allied with Hypocrisy, and Envy steers"
1787,LIB. II.,their boat. Therefore flee this vice and let thy semblant always be
1788,LIB. II.,"true. When Envy desires to deceive, it is False Semblant who is his"
1789,LIB. II.,"messenger; and as the mirror shows what was never within it, so he"
1790,LIB. II.,shows in his countenance that which is not in his heart. Dost thou
1791,LIB. II.,"follow this vice, my son?"
1792,LIB. II.,
1793,LIB. II.,"Nay, father, for ought I know; but question me, I pray you."

1795,LIB. II.,"Tell me then, my son, if ever thou hast gained the confidence of any"
1796,LIB. II.,man in order to tell out his secrets and hinder him in his love. Dost
1797,LIB. II.,thou practise such devices?
1798,LIB. II.,
1799,LIB. II.,For the most part I say nay; but in some measure I confess I may be
1800,LIB. II.,reckoned with those that use false colours. I feign to my fellow at
1801,LIB. II.,"times, until I know his counsels in love, and if they concern my lady,"
1802,LIB. II.,"I endeavour to overthrow them. If they have to do with others than she,"
1803,LIB. II.,I break no covenant with him nor try to hinder him in his love; but
1804,LIB. II.,with regard to her my ears and my heart are open to hear all that any
1805,LIB. II.,"man will say,--first that I may excuse her if they speak ill of her,"
1806,LIB. II.,and secondly that I may know who her lovers are. Then I tell tales of
1807,LIB. II.,"them to my lady, to hinder their suit and further mine. And though I"
1808,LIB. II.,"myself have no help from it, I can conceal nothing from her which it"
1809,LIB. II.,"concerns her to know. To him who loves not my lady, let him love as"
1810,LIB. II.,"many others as he will, I feign no semblant, and his tales sink no"
1811,LIB. II.,"deeper than my ears. Now, father, what is your doom and what pain must"
1812,LIB. II.,I suffer? (1879-2076.)
1813,LIB. II.,
1814,LIB. II.,"My son, all virtue should be praised and all vice blamed: therefore"
1815,LIB. II.,"put no visor on thy face. Yet many men do so nowadays, and especially"
1816,LIB. II.,"I hear how False Semblant goes with those whom we call Lombards, men"
1817,LIB. II.,"who are cunning to feign that which is not, and who take from us the"
1818,LIB. II.,"profit of our own land, while we bear the burdens. They have a craft"
1819,LIB. II.,"called _Fa crere_, and against this no usher can bar the door. This"
1820,LIB. II.,craft discovers everything and makes it known in foreign lands to our
1821,LIB. II.,grievous loss. Those who read in books the examples of this vice of
1822,LIB. II.,"False Semblant, will be the more on their guard against it. (2077-2144.)"
1823,LIB. II.,
1824,LIB. II.,"_Hercules and Deianira._ I will tell thee a tale of False Semblant, and"
1825,LIB. II.,how Deianira and Hercules suffered by it. Hercules had cast his heart
1826,LIB. II.,"only upon this fair Deianira, and once he desired to pass over a river"
1827,LIB. II.,"with her, but he knew not the ford. There was there a giant called"
1828,LIB. II.,"Nessus, who envying Hercules thought to do him harm by treachery,"
1829,LIB. II.,"since he dared not fight against him openly. Therefore, pretending"
1830,LIB. II.,"friendship, he offered to carry the lady across and set her safe on"
1831,LIB. II.,"the other shore. Hercules was well pleased, and Nessus took her upon"
1832,LIB. II.,"his shoulder; but when he was on the further side, he attempted to"
1833,LIB. II.,carry her away with him. Hercules came after them and shot him with a
1834,LIB. II.,"poisoned arrow, but before he died he gave Deianira his shirt stained"
1835,LIB. II.,"with his heart’s blood, telling her that if her lord were untrue, this"
1836,LIB. II.,shirt would make his love return to her. She kept it well in coffer
1837,LIB. II.,"and said no word. The years passed, and Hercules set his heart upon"
1838,LIB. II.,"Eole, the king’s daughter of Eurice, so that he dressed himself in"
1839,LIB. II.,"her clothes and she was clothed in his, and no remedy could be found"
1840,LIB. II.,"for his folly. Deianira knew no other help, but took this shirt and"
1841,LIB. II.,"sent it to him. The shirt set his body on fire, and clove to it so"
1842,LIB. II.,that it could not be torn away. He ran to the high wood and tore down
1843,LIB. II.,"trees and made a huge fire, into which he leapt and was burnt both"
1844,LIB. II.,flesh and bones. And all this came of the False Semblant which Nessus
1845,LIB. II.,"made. Therefore, my son, beware, since so great a man was thus lost."

1854,LIB. II.,
1855,LIB. II.,2327-3110. SUPPLANTATION. This vice has often overthrown men and
1856,LIB. II.,deprived them of their dignities. Supplantation obtains for himself the
1857,LIB. II.,"profit of other men’s loss, and raises himself upon their fall. In the"
1858,LIB. II.,same way there are lovers who supplant others and deprive them of what
1859,LIB. II.,"is theirs by right, reaping what others have sown. If thou hast done"
1860,LIB. II.,"so, my son, confess."
1861,LIB. II.,
1862,LIB. II.,"For ought I know, father, I am guiltless in deed, but not so"
1863,LIB. II.,"in thought. If I had had the power, I would long ago have made"
1864,LIB. II.,"appropriation of other men’s love. But this only as regards one, for"
1865,LIB. II.,"whom I let all others go. If I could, I would turn away her heart from"
1866,LIB. II.,"her other lovers and supplant them, no matter by what device: but force"
1867,LIB. II.,"I dare not use for fear of scandal. If this be sin, my father, I am"

1870,LIB. II.,"My son, God beholds a man’s thought, and if thou knewest what it were"
1871,LIB. II.,"to be a supplanter in love, thou wouldest for thine own sake take heed."
1872,LIB. II.,"At Troy Agamenon supplanted Achilles, and Diomede Troilus. _Geta_"
1873,LIB. II.,"and _Amphitrion_ too were friends, and Geta was the lover of Almena:"
1874,LIB. II.,"but when he was absent, Amphitrion made his way to her chamber and"

1879,LIB. II.,_The False Bachelor._ There was an Emperor of Rome who ruled in peace
1880,LIB. II.,"and had no wars. His son was chivalrous and desirous of fame, so he"
1881,LIB. II.,"besought leave to go forth and seek adventures, but his father refused"
1882,LIB. II.,"to grant it. At length he stole away with a knight whom he trusted,"
1883,LIB. II.,"and they took service with the Soldan of Persia, who had war with the"
1884,LIB. II.,Caliph of Egypt. There this prince did valiantly and gained renown;
1885,LIB. II.,"moreover, he was overtaken by love of the Soldan’s fair daughter, so"
1886,LIB. II.,"that his prowess grew more and more, and none could stand against him."
1887,LIB. II.,"At length the Soldan and the Caliph drew to a battle, and the Soldan"
1888,LIB. II.,"took a gold ring of his daughter and commanded her, if he should fall"
1889,LIB. II.,"in the fight, to marry the man who should produce this ring. In the"
1890,LIB. II.,"battle this Roman did great deeds, and Egypt fled in his presence. As"
1891,LIB. II.,"they of Persia pursued, an arrow struck the Soldan and he was borne"
1892,LIB. II.,wounded to a tent. Dying he gave his daughter’s ring to this knight of
1893,LIB. II.,"Rome. After his burial a parliament was appointed, and on the night"
1894,LIB. II.,"before it met, this young lord told his secret to his bachelor and"
1895,LIB. II.,"showed him the ring. The bachelor feigned gladness, but when his lord"
1896,LIB. II.,"was asleep, he stole the ring from his purse and put another in its"
1897,LIB. II.,"stead. When the court was set, the young lady was brought forth. The"
1898,LIB. II.,"bachelor drew forth the ring and claimed her hand, which was allowed"
1899,LIB. II.,"him in spite of protest, and so he was crowned ruler of the empire."
1900,LIB. II.,"His lord fell sick of sorrow, caring only for the loss of his love;"
1901,LIB. II.,and before his death he called the lords to him and sent a message to
1902,LIB. II.,"his lady, and wrote also a letter to his father the Emperor. Thus he"
1903,LIB. II.,"died, and the treason was known. The false bachelor was sent to Rome on"
1904,LIB. II.,"demand of the Emperor, to receive punishment there, and the dead body"
1905,LIB. II.,also was taken thither for burial. (2501-2781.)
1906,LIB. II.,
1907,LIB. II.,"Thus thou mayest be well advised, my son, not to do so; and above all"
1908,LIB. II.,"when Pride and Envy are joined together, no man can find a remedy for"
1909,LIB. II.,"the evil. Of this I find a true example in a chronicle of old time,"
1910,LIB. II.,showing how Supplant worked once in Holy Church. I know not if it be so

1913,LIB. II.,"_Pope Boniface._ At Rome Pope Nicholas died, and the cardinals met in"
1914,LIB. II.,conclave to choose another Pope. They agreed upon a holy recluse full
1915,LIB. II.,"of ghostly virtues, and he was made Pope and called Celestin. There"
1916,LIB. II.,"was a cardinal, however, who had long desired the papacy, and he was"
1917,LIB. II.,seized with such envy that he thought to supplant the Pope by artifice.
1918,LIB. II.,He caused a young priest of his family to be appointed to the Pope’s
1919,LIB. II.,"chamber, and he told this man to take a trumpet of brass and by means"
1920,LIB. II.,"of it speak to the Pope at midnight through the wall, bidding him"
1921,LIB. II.,"renounce his dignity. This he did thrice; and the Pope, conceiving it"
1922,LIB. II.,"to be a voice from heaven, asked the cardinals in consistory whether"
1923,LIB. II.,a Pope might resign his place. All sat silent except this cardinal
1924,LIB. II.,"of whom we have spoken, and he gave his opinion that the Pope could"
1925,LIB. II.,"make a decree by which this might be done. He did so, and the cardinal"
1926,LIB. II.,was elected in his stead under the name of Boniface. But such treason
1927,LIB. II.,"cannot be hid; it is like the spark of fire in the roof, which when"
1928,LIB. II.,blown by the wind blazes forth. Boniface openly boasted of his device;
1929,LIB. II.,"and such was his pride that he took quarrel with Louis, King of France,"
1930,LIB. II.,and laid his kingdom under interdict. The king was counselled by
1931,LIB. II.,"his barons, and he sent Sir William de Langharet, with a company of"
1932,LIB. II.,"men-at-arms, who captured the Pope at Pontsorge near Avignon and took"
1933,LIB. II.,"him into France, where he was put in bonds and died of hunger, eating"
1934,LIB. II.,"off both his hands. Of him it was said that he came in like a fox,"
1935,LIB. II.,"reigned like a lion, and died like a dog. By his example let all men"
1936,LIB. II.,beware of gaining office in the Church by wrongful means. God forbid
1937,LIB. II.,"that it should be of our days that the Abbot Joachim spake, when he"
1938,LIB. II.,prophesied of the shameful traffic which should dishonour the Church of
1939,LIB. II.,God. (2803-3084.)
1940,LIB. II.,
1941,LIB. II.,Envy it was that moved Joab to slay Abner treacherously; and for Envy
1942,LIB. II.,Achitophel hanged himself when his counsel was not preferred. Seneca
1943,LIB. II.,"says that Envy is the common wench who keeps tavern for the Court,"
1944,LIB. II.,and sells liquour which makes men drunk with desire to surpass their
1945,LIB. II.,fellows. (3085-3110.)
1946,LIB. II.,
1947,LIB. II.,Envy is in all ways unpleasant in love; the fire within dries up the
1948,LIB. II.,blood which should flow kindly through his veins. He alone is moved by
1949,LIB. II.,"pure malice in that which he does. Therefore, my son, if thou wouldest"
1950,LIB. II.,"find a way to love, put away Envy."
1951,LIB. II.,
1952,LIB. II.,"Reason would that I do so, father; but in order that I may flee from"

1955,LIB. II.,"My son, as there is physic for the sick, so there are virtues for the"
1956,LIB. II.,"vices, which quench them as water does a fire. Against Envy is set"
1957,LIB. II.,"Charity, the mother of Pity, which causes a man to be willing to bear"
1958,LIB. II.,evil himself rather than that another should suffer. Hear from me a
1959,LIB. II.,"tale about this, and mark it well. (3111-3186.)"

1961,LIB. II.,"_Constantine and Silvester._ In Latin books I find how Constantine,"
1962,LIB. II.,"the Emperor of Rome, had a leprosy which could not be cured, and wise"
1963,LIB. II.,men ordered for his healing a bath of the blood of children under
1964,LIB. II.,"seven years old. Orders were sent forth, and mothers brought their"
1965,LIB. II.,"children from all parts to the palace. The Emperor, hearing the noise"
1966,LIB. II.,"of lamentation, looked forth in the morning and was struck with pity."
1967,LIB. II.,"He thought to himself that rich and poor were all alike in God’s sight,"
1968,LIB. II.,and that a man should do to others as he would that others should do
1969,LIB. II.,to him. He resolved rather to suffer his malady than that so much
1970,LIB. II.,"innocent blood should be shed, and he sent the mothers and children"
1971,LIB. II.,away happy to their homes. In the night he had a vision of Saint Peter
1972,LIB. II.,"and Saint Paul, saying to him, that as he had shown mercy, mercy should"
1973,LIB. II.,"be shown to him, and bidding him send to fetch Silvester from Mount"
1974,LIB. II.,"Celion, where he was hiding for fear of the Emperor, who had been a foe"
1975,LIB. II.,"to Christ’s faith. They told him their names and departed, and he did"
1976,LIB. II.,as they commanded. Silvester came and preached to the Emperor of the
1977,LIB. II.,"redemption of mankind and the last judgement, and said that God had"
1978,LIB. II.,accepted the charity and pity which he had shown. Constantine received
1979,LIB. II.,baptism in the same vessel which had been prepared for the blood; and
1980,LIB. II.,"as he was being baptized, a light from heaven shone in the place and"
1981,LIB. II.,the leprosy fell from him as it were fishes’ scales. Thus body and soul
1982,LIB. II.,both were cleansed. The Emperor sent forth letters bidding all receive
1983,LIB. II.,"baptism on pain of death, and founded two churches in Rome for Peter"
1984,LIB. II.,"and Paul, to which he gave great worldly possessions. His will was"
1985,LIB. II.,"good, but the working of his deed was bad. As he made the gift, a voice"
1986,LIB. II.,was heard from heaven saying that the poison of temporal things was
1987,LIB. II.,"this day mingled with the spiritual. All may see the evil now, and may"
1988,LIB. II.,God amend it. (3187-3496.)

2017,LIB. III.,almost lose my wits; and when I think how long I have served and how I
2018,LIB. III.,"am refused, I am angry for the smallest thing, and every servant in my"
2019,LIB. III.,house is afraid of me until the fit passes. If I approach my lady and
2020,LIB. III.,"she speaks a fair word to me, all my anger is gone; but if she will not"
2021,LIB. III.,"look upon me, I return again to my former state. Thus I hurt my hand"

2034,LIB. III.,and the truth could not be hid. The father came into her chamber in a
2035,LIB. III.,"frenzy of wrath, and she in vain entreated for mercy. He sent a knight"
2036,LIB. III.,"to her with a sword, that she might slay herself; but first she wrote a"
2037,LIB. III.,"letter to her brother, while her child lay weeping in her breast. Then"
2038,LIB. III.,she set the pommel of the sword to ground and pierced her heart with
2039,LIB. III.,the point. The king bade them take the child and cast it out for wild

2066,LIB. III.,"I ought, the best plowman balks sometimes, and I have often spoken"
2067,LIB. III.,contrary to her command; but she knows well that I do not chide. Men
2068,LIB. III.,"may pray to God, and he will not be wroth; and my lady, being but a"

2095,LIB. III.,who deprived him of his sight. Jupiter in compensation gave him the
2096,LIB. III.,"gift of prophecy, but he would rather have had the sight of his eyes."

2177,LIB. III.,"in the wall between them and conversed through this, till at length"

2179,LIB. III.,there first; but a lion came to drink at the spring with snout all
2180,LIB. III.,"bloody from a slain beast, and she fled away, leaving her wimple on"

2184,LIB. III.,himself with his sword in his foolhaste. Tisbee came then and found
2185,LIB. III.,"him dead, and she called upon the god and goddess of love, who had so"
2186,LIB. III.,cruelly served those who were obedient to their law. At last her sorrow

2220,LIB. III.,_Phebus and Daphne._ Phebus laid his love on Daphne and followed his

2223,LIB. III.,"not speed. He pierced his heart therefore with a golden dart of fire,"
2224,LIB. III.,"and that of Daphne with a dart of lead. Thus the more Phebus pursued,"
2225,LIB. III.,"the more she fled away, and at length she was changed into a laurel"
2226,LIB. III.,"tree, which is ever green, in token that she remained ever a maid. Thus"

2245,LIB. III.,"turned to peace: for the nations, seeing the power which the kings had"
2246,LIB. III.,"gathered, sent and entreated them to lay aside their wrath. (1757-1856.)"
2247,LIB. III.,
2248,LIB. III.,"By this example refrain thine heart, my son, and do nothing by violence"
2249,LIB. III.,"which may be done by love. As touching Homicide, it often happens"
2250,LIB. III.,"unadvisedly through Will, when Reason is away, and great vengeance has"
2251,LIB. III.,sometimes followed. Whereof I shall tell a tale which it is pity to
2252,LIB. III.,hear. (1857-1884.)
2253,LIB. III.,
2254,LIB. III.,"_Orestes._ Agamenon, having returned from Troy, was slain by his wife"
2255,LIB. III.,"Climestre and her lover Egistus. Horestes, his infant son, was saved"
2256,LIB. III.,"and delivered into the keeping of the king of Crete. When he grew up,"
2257,LIB. III.,"he resolved to avenge his father, and coming to Athens gathered a power"
2258,LIB. III.,there with the help of the duke. When he offered sacrifice in a temple
2259,LIB. III.,"for his success, the god gave him command to slay his mother, tearing"
2260,LIB. III.,away her breasts with his own hands and giving her body to be devoured.
2261,LIB. III.,He rode to Micene and took the city by siege: then he sent for his
2262,LIB. III.,"mother and did as the oracle had commanded. Egistus, coming to the"
2263,LIB. III.,"rescue of Micene, was caught in an ambush and hanged as a traitor."
2264,LIB. III.,
2265,LIB. III.,"Fame spread these deeds abroad, and many blamed Horestes for slaying"
2266,LIB. III.,his mother. The lords met at Athens and sent for him to come and
2267,LIB. III.,answer for his deed. He told how the gods had laid a charge upon him
2268,LIB. III.,"to execute judgement, as he had done, and Menesteus, a duke and worthy"
2269,LIB. III.,"knight, spoke for him and championed his cause. They concluded upon"
2270,LIB. III.,"this that since she had committed so foul an adultery and murder, she"
2271,LIB. III.,"had deserved the punishment, and Horestes was crowned king of Micene."
2272,LIB. III.,"Egiona, daughter of Egistus and Climestre, who had consented to the"
2273,LIB. III.,"murder of Agamenon, hanged herself for sorrow that her brother had been"
2274,LIB. III.,acquitted. Such is the vengeance for murder. (1885-2195.)
2275,LIB. III.,
2276,LIB. III.,"My father, I pray you tell me if it is possible without sin to slay a"
2277,LIB. III.,man.
2278,LIB. III.,
2279,LIB. III.,"Yea, my son, in sundry wise. The judge commits sin if he spares to slay"
2280,LIB. III.,those who deserve death by the law. Moreover a man may defend his house
2281,LIB. III.,"and his land in war, and slay if no better may be."
2282,LIB. III.,
2283,LIB. III.,"I beseech you, father, to tell me whether those that seek war in a"
2284,LIB. III.,"worldly cause, and shed blood, do well. (2196-2250.)"
2285,LIB. III.,
2286,LIB. III.,"_War._ God has forbidden homicide, and when God’s Son was born, his"
2287,LIB. III.,angels proclaimed peace to the men of good will. Therefore by the law
2288,LIB. III.,"of charity there should be no war, and nature also commends peace."
2289,LIB. III.,War consorts with pestilence and famine and brings every kind of evil
2290,LIB. III.,upon the earth. I know not what reward he deserves who brings in such
2291,LIB. III.,"things; and if he do it to gain heaven’s grace, he shall surely fail."
2292,LIB. III.,"Since wars are so evil in God’s sight, it is a marvel what ails men"
2293,LIB. III.,"that they cannot establish peace. Sin, I trow, is the cause, and the"
2294,LIB. III.,"wages of sin is death. Covetousness first brought in war, and among the"
2295,LIB. III.,"Greeks Arcadia alone was free from war, because it was barren and poor."
2296,LIB. III.,Yet it is a wonder that a worthy king or lord will claim that to which
2297,LIB. III.,"he has no right. Nature and law both are against it, but Wit is here"
2298,LIB. III.,"oppressed by Will, and some cause is feigned to deceive the world. Thou"
2299,LIB. III.,"mayest take an example of this, how men excuse their wrong-doing, and"
2300,LIB. III.,how the poor and the rich are alike in the lust for gain. (2251-2362.)
2301,LIB. III.,
2302,LIB. III.,_Alexander and the Pirate._ A sea-rover was brought before Alexander
2303,LIB. III.,"and accused of his misdeeds. He replied, ‘I have a heart like thine,"
2304,LIB. III.,"and if I had the power, I would do as thou dost. But since I am the"
2305,LIB. III.,"leader of a few men only, I am called a thief, while thou with thy"
2306,LIB. III.,great armies art called an Emperor. Rich and poor are not weighed
2307,LIB. III.,evenly in the balance.’ The king approved his boldness and retained him
2308,LIB. III.,in his service. (2363-2417.)
2309,LIB. III.,
2310,LIB. III.,"Thus they who are set on destruction are all of one accord, captain"
2311,LIB. III.,"and company alike. When reason is put aside, man follows rapine like"
2312,LIB. III.,"a bird of prey, and all the world may not suffice for his desires."
2313,LIB. III.,"Alexander overran the whole earth and died miserably, when he"
2314,LIB. III.,"thought himself most secure. Lo, what profit it is to slay men for"
2315,LIB. III.,"covetousness, as if they were beasts. Beware, my son, of slaying."

2320,LIB. III.,
2321,LIB. III.,"My son, Christ bade men preach and suffer for the faith. He made all"
2322,LIB. III.,"men free by his own death, and his apostles after him preached and"
2323,LIB. III.,suffered death: but if they had wished to spread the faith by the
2324,LIB. III.,"sword, it would never have prevailed. We see that since the time when"
2325,LIB. III.,"the Church took the sword in hand, a great part of that which was won"
2326,LIB. III.,has been lost to Christ’s faith. Be well advised then always ere thou
2327,LIB. III.,slay. Homicide stands now even in the Church itself; and when the well
2328,LIB. III.,"of pity is thus defouled with blood, others do not hesitate to make war"
2329,LIB. III.,and to slay. We see murder now upon the earth as in the days when men
2330,LIB. III.,bought and sold sins.
2331,LIB. III.,
2332,LIB. III.,In Greece before Christ’s faith men were dispensed of the guilt of
2333,LIB. III.,"murder by paying gold: so it was with Peleus, Medea, Almeus, and so it"
2334,LIB. III.,is still. But after this life it shall be known how it fares with those
2335,LIB. III.,"who do such things. Beasts do not prey upon their own kind, and it is"
2336,LIB. III.,not reasonable that man should be worse than a beast.
2337,LIB. III.,
2338,LIB. III.,"Solinus tells a tale of a bird with man’s face, which dies of sorrow"
2339,LIB. III.,when it has slain a man. By this example men should eschew homicide and
2340,LIB. III.,follow mercy. (2485-2621.)
2341,LIB. III.,
2342,LIB. III.,I have heard examples of this virtue of MERCY among those who followed
2343,LIB. III.,"the wars. Remember, my son, that this virtue brings grace, and that"

2348,LIB. III.,"Theucer, king of Mese. Achilles was about to slay the king in the"
2349,LIB. III.,"battle, but Telaphus interceded for him, saying that Theucer once did"
2350,LIB. III.,him good service. Thus the king’s life was spared but the Greeks won
2351,LIB. III.,"the victory. Theucer, grateful for this and for other service before"
2352,LIB. III.,"rendered by Achilles, made Telaphus heir to all his land, and thus was"

2378,LIB. IV.,
2379,LIB. IV.,"Yes, my father, I confess I am guilty. When I have set a time to speak"
2380,LIB. IV.,"to that sweet maid, Lachesce has often told me that another time is"
2381,LIB. IV.,"better, or has bidden me write instead of speaking by mouth. Thus I"
2382,LIB. IV.,"have let the time slide for Sloth, until it was too late. But my love"

2417,LIB. IV.,"of dread. So as regards love there are truants that dare not speak, who"

2431,LIB. IV.,"thou mayest learn that word may work above nature, and that the god of"
2432,LIB. IV.,love is favourable to those who are steadfast in love. About which also

2458,LIB. IV.,"my forgetfulness; but I never forget the thought of her, nor should do,"
2459,LIB. IV.,"though I had the Ring of Oblivion, which Moses made for Tharbis. She is"

2563,LIB. IV.,"think upon my bridle.’ Thus she passed out of sight like a cloud, and"
2564,LIB. IV.,"the lady was moved with fear and amended her ways, swearing within her"
2565,LIB. IV.,heart that she would bear no halters. (1245-1446.)
2566,LIB. IV.,
2567,LIB. IV.,"Understand then, my son, that as this lady was chastised, so should"
2568,LIB. IV.,"those knights take heed who are idle towards love, lest they deserve"
2569,LIB. IV.,even a greater punishment. Maidens too must follow the law of love and
2570,LIB. IV.,not waste that time during which they might be bearing the charge of
2571,LIB. IV.,children for the service of the world. And about this I think to tell
2572,LIB. IV.,them a tale. (1447-1504.)
2573,LIB. IV.,
2574,LIB. IV.,"_Jephthah’s daughter._ Among the Jews there was a duke named Jepte,"
2575,LIB. IV.,"who going to war against Amon, made a vow that if victory were granted"
2576,LIB. IV.,"to him, he would sacrifice to God the first who should meet him on his"
2577,LIB. IV.,"return. He overcame his foes and returning met his daughter, who came"
2578,LIB. IV.,forth to welcome him with songs and dances. When she saw his sorrow
2579,LIB. IV.,"and heard the vow that he had made, she bade him keep his covenant,"
2580,LIB. IV.,"and asked only for a respite of forty days to bewail her maidenhead,"
2581,LIB. IV.,in that she had brought forth no children for the increase of her
2582,LIB. IV.,people. So with other maidens she went weeping over the downs and the
2583,LIB. IV.,"dales, and mourned for the lost time which she never could now redeem."
2584,LIB. IV.,(1505-1595.)
2585,LIB. IV.,
2586,LIB. IV.,"Father, ye have done well to rebuke maidens for this vice of Sloth: but"
2587,LIB. IV.,"as to the travail which ye say men ought to take for love, what mean ye"
2588,LIB. IV.,by this?
2589,LIB. IV.,
2590,LIB. IV.,"I was thinking, my son, of the deeds of arms that men did in former"
2591,LIB. IV.,times for love’s sake. He who seeks grace in love must not spare his
2592,LIB. IV.,"travail. He must ride sometimes in Pruce and sometimes in Tartary, so"
2593,LIB. IV.,"that the heralds may cry after him, ‘Valiant, Valiant!’ and his fame"
2594,LIB. IV.,"may come to his lady’s ear. This is the thing I mean. Confess, if thou"
2595,LIB. IV.,hast been idle in this. (1596-1647.)
2596,LIB. IV.,
2597,LIB. IV.,"Yea, my father, and ever was. I know not what good may come of slaying"
2598,LIB. IV.,"the heathen, and I should have little gain from passing over the sea,"
2599,LIB. IV.,if in the meantime I lost my lady at home. Let them pass the sea whom
2600,LIB. IV.,Christ commanded to preach his faith to all the world; but now they sit
2601,LIB. IV.,at ease and bid us slay those whom they should convert. If I slay a
2602,LIB. IV.,"Saracen, I slay body and soul both, and that was never Christ’s lore."
2603,LIB. IV.,
2604,LIB. IV.,"As for me, I will serve love, and go or stay as love bids me. I have"
2605,LIB. IV.,"heard that Achilles left his arms at Troy for love of Polixenen, and so"
2606,LIB. IV.,"may I do: but if my lady bade me labour for her, I would pass through"
2607,LIB. IV.,sky or sea at her command. Nevertheless I see that those who labour
2608,LIB. IV.,"most for love, win often the least reward, and though I have never been"
2609,LIB. IV.,"idle in deed, yet the effect is always idleness, for my business avails"
2610,LIB. IV.,me nothing. Therefore idle I will call myself.
2611,LIB. IV.,
2612,LIB. IV.,"My son, be patient. Thou knowest not what chance may fall. It is"
2613,LIB. IV.,better to wait on the tide than to row against the stream. Perchance
2614,LIB. IV.,the revolution of the heavens is not yet in accord with thy condition.
2615,LIB. IV.,I can bear witness to Venus that thou hast not been idle in love;
2616,LIB. IV.,but since thou art slow to travail in arms and makest an argument of
2617,LIB. IV.,"Achilles, I will tell thee a tale to the contrary. (1648-1814.)"
2618,LIB. IV.,
2619,LIB. IV.,"_Nauplus and Ulysses._ King Nauplus, father of Palamades, came to"
2620,LIB. IV.,"persuade Ulixes to go with the Greeks to Troy. He, however, desired to"
2621,LIB. IV.,"stay at home with his wife, and feigning madness he yoked foxes to his"
2622,LIB. IV.,plough and sowed the land with salt. Nauplus saw the cause and laid the
2623,LIB. IV.,infant son of Ulixes before his plough. The father turned the plough
2624,LIB. IV.,"aside, and Nauplus rebuked him for thus unworthily forsaking the honour"
2625,LIB. IV.,of arms and for setting love before knighthood. He repented of his
2626,LIB. IV.,folly and went forth with them to Troy. (1815-1891.)
2627,LIB. IV.,
2628,LIB. IV.,Thus a knight must prefer honour to worldly ease and put away all
2629,LIB. IV.,"dread, as did _Prothesilai_, whose wife wrote to him that he should"
2630,LIB. IV.,lose his life if he landed at Troy; and he took no heed of her womanish
2631,LIB. IV.,"fears, but was the first to land, choosing rather to die with honour"
2632,LIB. IV.,than to live reproved. (1892-1934.)
2633,LIB. IV.,
2634,LIB. IV.,"_Saul_ too, when the spirit of Samuel told him that he should be slain"
2635,LIB. IV.,"in battle, would not draw back from the danger, but with Jonathas his"
2636,LIB. IV.,"son he met his enemies on the mountains of Gelboe, and won eternal"
2637,LIB. IV.,fame. (1935-1962.)
2638,LIB. IV.,
2639,LIB. IV.,"_Education of Achilles._ Prowess is founded upon hardihood, and we know"
2640,LIB. IV.,"how Achilles was brought up to this by Chiro, called Centaurus. He was"
2641,LIB. IV.,"taught not to make his chase after the beasts that fled from him, but"
2642,LIB. IV.,to fight with such as would withstand him. Moreover a covenant was set
2643,LIB. IV.,"that every day he should slay, or at least wound, some savage beast, as"
2644,LIB. IV.,"a lion or a tiger, and bring home with him a token of blood upon his"
2645,LIB. IV.,weapon. Thus he came to surpass all other knights. (1963-2013.)
2646,LIB. IV.,
2647,LIB. IV.,"Other examples there are, as of Lancelot and many more, which show how"
2648,LIB. IV.,Prowess in arms has led to success in love. Let this tale be witness of
2649,LIB. IV.,it. (2014-2044.)
2650,LIB. IV.,
2651,LIB. IV.,_Hercules and Achelons._ King Oënes of Calidoyne had a daughter
2652,LIB. IV.,"Deianire, who was promised in marriage to Achelons, a giant and a"
2653,LIB. IV.,"magician. Hercules, that worthy knight who set up the two pillars of"
2654,LIB. IV.,"brass in the desert of India, sought her love, and the king dared not"
2655,LIB. IV.,refuse him. It was ordained then that combat should decide between
2656,LIB. IV.,"them. Achelons, stirred up to prowess by love, fought boldly, but"
2657,LIB. IV.,Hercules seized him with irresistible strength. Then Achelons tried his
2658,LIB. IV.,"craft, changing himself into a snake first and then a bull. Hercules,"
2659,LIB. IV.,"however, held him by the horns and forced him down, till at length he"
2660,LIB. IV.,was overcome. Thus Hercules won his wife by prowess. (2045-2134.)
2661,LIB. IV.,
2662,LIB. IV.,"So _Pantasilee_, queen of Feminee, for love of Hector did deeds of"
2663,LIB. IV.,"prowess at Troy; and _Philemenis_, because he brought home the body of"
2664,LIB. IV.,"Pantasilee and saved some of her maidens, had a tribute granted to him"
2665,LIB. IV.,of three maidens yearly from the land of Amazoine. _Eneas_ also won
2666,LIB. IV.,Lavine in battle against king Turnus. By these examples thou mayest
2667,LIB. IV.,"see how love’s grace may be gained, for worthy women love manhood and"
2668,LIB. IV.,gentilesse. (2135-2199.)
2669,LIB. IV.,
2670,LIB. IV.,"What is _Gentilesse_, my father?"
2671,LIB. IV.,
2672,LIB. IV.,"Some set that name upon riches coming down from old time, but there is"
2673,LIB. IV.,"no true merit in riches; and as for lineage, all are descended from"
2674,LIB. IV.,Adam and Eve. Rich and poor are alike in their birth and in their
2675,LIB. IV.,"death; the true gentilesse depends upon virtue, and for virtue love may"
2676,LIB. IV.,"profit much. Especially love is opposed to Sloth, and Sloth is most of"
2677,LIB. IV.,"all contrary to the nature of man, for by it all knowledge is lost."
2678,LIB. IV.,(2200-2362.)
2679,LIB. IV.,
2680,LIB. IV.,"By _Labour_ it was that all useful arts were found out, and the names"
2681,LIB. IV.,"of many inventors have been handed down by fame, as Cham, Cadmus,"
2682,LIB. IV.,"Theges, Termegis, Josephus, Heredot, Jubal, Zenzis, Promotheus, Tubal,"
2683,LIB. IV.,"Jadahel, Verconius, and among women Minerve and Delbora. Saturnus found"

2686,LIB. IV.,Many philosophers have contrived the getting and refining of
2687,LIB. IV.,"metals and the science of _Alconomie_, by which gold and silver are"
2688,LIB. IV.,"multiplied, with the working of the seven bodies and the four spirits"
2689,LIB. IV.,for the finding of the perfect Elixir.

2693,LIB. IV.,"are helped in their working, and the Mineral, by which metals are"
2694,LIB. IV.,"transformed. This science is a true one, but men know not how to follow"
2695,LIB. IV.,"it rightly, so that it brings in only poverty and debt. They who first"
2696,LIB. IV.,"founded it have great names, as Hermes, Geber, Ortolan and others."

2698,LIB. IV.,
2699,LIB. IV.,"With regard to _Language_, Carmente was the first who invented the"
2700,LIB. IV.,"Latin letters, and then came those who laid down the rules of rhetoric,"
2701,LIB. IV.,"as Aristarchus, Dindimus, Tullius and Cithero. Jerome translated the"
2702,LIB. IV.,"Bible from Hebrew, and others also translated books into Latin from"
2703,LIB. IV.,"Arabic and Greek. In poetry Ovid wrote for lovers, and taught how love"

2709,LIB. IV.,
2710,LIB. IV.,"That is well said, my son, if there be any way by which love may be"
2711,LIB. IV.,achieved; and assuredly he who will not labour and dares not venture
2712,LIB. IV.,will attain to nothing. (2633-2700.)
2713,LIB. IV.,
2714,LIB. IV.,"2701-3388. SOMNOLENCE. The chamberlain of Sloth is Somnolence, who"
2715,LIB. IV.,sleeps when he should be awake. When knights and ladies revel in
2716,LIB. IV.,"company, he skulks away like a hare and lays himself down to rest; and"
2717,LIB. IV.,"there he dreams and snores, and when he wakes, he expounds his dreams."
2718,LIB. IV.,"If thou wilt serve love, my son, do not thou so."
2719,LIB. IV.,
2720,LIB. IV.,"Surely not, father; it were better for me to die than to have such"
2721,LIB. IV.,"sluggardy, or rather it were better I had never been born. I have never"
2722,LIB. IV.,"been sleepy in the place where my lady was, whether I should dance"
2723,LIB. IV.,"with her, or cast the dice, or read of Troilus. When it is late and I"
2724,LIB. IV.,"must needs go, I look piteously upon her and take leave upon my knee,"
2725,LIB. IV.,"or kiss her if I may; and then before I depart from the house, I feign"
2726,LIB. IV.,some cause to return and take leave of her again. Then afterwards I
2727,LIB. IV.,"curse the night for driving me away from her company, and I sigh and"
2728,LIB. IV.,"wish for day, or think of the happiness of those who have their love"
2729,LIB. IV.,"by their side all the long night through. At last I go to bed, but my"
2730,LIB. IV.,"heart remains still with her: no lock may shut him out, and he passes"
2731,LIB. IV.,through the strongest wall. He goes into her bed and takes her softly
2732,LIB. IV.,"in his arms, and wishes that his body also were there. In my dreams"
2733,LIB. IV.,"again I suffer the torments of love, or if I dream sometimes that I"
2734,LIB. IV.,"meet her alone and that Danger has been left behind, I wake only to"
2735,LIB. IV.,find all in vain.
2736,LIB. IV.,
2737,LIB. IV.,"My son, in past times many dreams have told of truth, as thou mayest"
2738,LIB. IV.,know by a tale. (2701-2926.)
2739,LIB. IV.,
2740,LIB. IV.,"_Ceix and Alceone._ Ceix, king of Trocinie, went on a pilgrimage for"
2741,LIB. IV.,"the sake of his brother Dedalion, and left at home Alceone his wife."
2742,LIB. IV.,"She besought him to fix the time of his return, and he said ‘Within two"
2743,LIB. IV.,"months.’ The time passed and she heard no tidings, and Juno, to whom"
2744,LIB. IV.,"she prayed, sent Yris to the house of Sleep, bidding him show this lady"
2745,LIB. IV.,by dream how the matter was.
2746,LIB. IV.,
2747,LIB. IV.,"Yris bent the heaven like a bow and came down, and she went to the"
2748,LIB. IV.,"place where Sleep had his dwelling, in a cave where no sun ever shone"
2749,LIB. IV.,"and no sound could be heard but the murmur of the river Lethes, which"
2750,LIB. IV.,ran hard by. He himself was sleeping in a chamber strewn up and down
2751,LIB. IV.,"with dreams, and long it was ere her words could pierce his ears. When"
2752,LIB. IV.,"he at length understood the message, he chose out three, Morpheus,"
2753,LIB. IV.,"Ithecus and Panthasas, to do this deed. Morpheus appeared to Alceone in"
2754,LIB. IV.,"the form of her husband lying dead upon the shore, while the other two"
2755,LIB. IV.,showed her in action the scene of the tempest and the wreck. She cried
2756,LIB. IV.,"out in terror and awoke, and on the morrow, going down to the sea, she"
2757,LIB. IV.,saw his body floating on the waves. Careless of death she leapt into
2758,LIB. IV.,"the deep, and would have caught him in her arms; but the gods pitied"
2759,LIB. IV.,"them and changed them into birds of the sea, and so they dwelt together"
2760,LIB. IV.,lovingly. (2927-3123.)
2761,LIB. IV.,
2762,LIB. IV.,Thus dreams prove sometimes true.
2763,LIB. IV.,
2764,LIB. IV.,"Father, I have said that when I am in my lady’s company, I do not"
2765,LIB. IV.,"desire to sleep. But at other times I care little to wake, for I cannot"
2766,LIB. IV.,endure to be in company without her. I know not if this be Somnolence.
2767,LIB. IV.,
2768,LIB. IV.,"I acquit thee, my son, and I will tell a tale to show how little love"
2769,LIB. IV.,and sleep are in accord. (3124-3186.)
2770,LIB. IV.,
2771,LIB. IV.,_Prayer of Cephalus._ He who will wake by night for love may take
2772,LIB. IV.,"example by Cephalus, who when he lay with Aurora prayed to the Sun and"
2773,LIB. IV.,"to the Moon that the night might be made longer and the day delayed, in"
2774,LIB. IV.,order that he might follow only the law of love. Sloth cares nothing
2775,LIB. IV.,"for the night except that he may sleep, but Cephalus did otherwise."
2776,LIB. IV.,(3187-3275.)
2777,LIB. IV.,
2778,LIB. IV.,"My father, that is no wonder, since he had his love by his side. But"
2779,LIB. IV.,"this is never my case, so I have never need to entreat the Sun to stay"
2780,LIB. IV.,"his chariot, or the Moon to lengthen her course. Sometimes I have a"
2781,LIB. IV.,"dream that makes me glad, but afterwards I find it untrue: so that I"
2782,LIB. IV.,know not of what use sleep is to man.
2783,LIB. IV.,
2784,LIB. IV.,"True, my son, except that it helps nature, when it is taken in due"
2785,LIB. IV.,"measure. But he who sleeps unduly may come by misfortune, as I can show"
2786,LIB. IV.,by a tale. (3276-3316.)
2787,LIB. IV.,
2788,LIB. IV.,"_Argus and Mercury._ Jupiter lay by Io, wherefore Juno changed her"
2789,LIB. IV.,"into a cow and gave her into the keeping of Argus, who had a hundred"
2790,LIB. IV.,"eyes. Mercury came to steal the cow, and he piped so cunningly that"
2791,LIB. IV.,Argus fell asleep. So Mercury smote off his head and took away Io.
2792,LIB. IV.,"Therefore, my son, beware thou sleep not overmuch. (3317-3364.)"

2808,LIB. IV.,"_Iphis and Araxarathen._ Iphis, son of king Theucer, loved a maid of"

2810,LIB. IV.,"listen to his suit. At length being brought to despair, he came before"
2811,LIB. IV.,"her house in the night, and having bewailed his case and lamented her"
2812,LIB. IV.,"hardness of heart, he hanged himself upon the post of the gate. On the"
2813,LIB. IV.,"morrow the maiden took the guilt upon herself, and prayed that no pity"
2814,LIB. IV.,"might be shown to her, as she had shown no pity to him. The gods took"
2815,LIB. IV.,away her life and changed her into stone; and men carried the body of
2816,LIB. IV.,Iphis to the city and set up the stone image of the maiden above his
2817,LIB. IV.,"tomb, with an epitaph telling of their fate. (3515-3684.)"

2826,LIB. V.,AVARICE is the root of all strife among men. He ever gets more and more

2828,LIB. V.,his riches any more than an ox from his ploughing or a sheep from his
2829,LIB. V.,"wool: instead of being master of his wealth, he serves it as a slave."
2830,LIB. V.,"Dost thou fare so in love, my son?"
2831,LIB. V.,
2832,LIB. V.,"No, my father, for I was never in possession; but I cannot here excuse"
2833,LIB. V.,"my will, for if I had my lady, I would never let her go; and herein I"
2834,LIB. V.,"am like the avaricious man. Moreover, though I have not the wealth, yet"
2835,LIB. V.,"I have the care, and am like that ox of which ye told before. Judge if"

2837,LIB. V.,
2838,LIB. V.,"My son, it is no wonder if thou art a slave to love; but to be a slave"

2840,LIB. V.,
2841,LIB. V.,"_Midas._ Bacchus had a priest named Cillenus, and he being drunk and"
2842,LIB. V.,"wandering in Frige was brought in bonds before Mide, the king of that"
2843,LIB. V.,"land. This king dealt with him courteously, and Bacchus in reward of"
2844,LIB. V.,this bade him ask what worldly thing he would. He debated long within
2845,LIB. V.,"himself between three things, pleasure, power and wealth; and at length"
2846,LIB. V.,he asked that all things might be turned by his touch to gold. The boon
2847,LIB. V.,"granted, he tried his power on stone and leaf, but when he at length"
2848,LIB. V.,"sat down to meat, then he saw the folly of Avarice, and prayed Bacchus"
2849,LIB. V.,"to take back his gift. The god took pity and bade him bathe in Paceole,"
2850,LIB. V.,and so he recovered his first estate; but the stones in the bed of the
2851,LIB. V.,"river were changed to gold. He went home and put away his Avarice, and"
2852,LIB. V.,taught his people to till the land and breed cattle rather than seek
2853,LIB. V.,increase of gold. (141-332.)
2854,LIB. V.,
2855,LIB. V.,"Before gold was coined, war and usury were unknown, but now through"
2856,LIB. V.,"Avarice all the world is out of joint. When thou seest a man have need,"
2857,LIB. V.,"give him of thy substance, for the pain of _Tantalus_ awaits those"
2858,LIB. V.,who will not give: they stand in a river up to their chin and yet
2859,LIB. V.,"cannot drink, and fruit hangs over and touches their lips, of which"
2860,LIB. V.,"they cannot eat. Thus Avarice hungers ever after more, though he has"
2861,LIB. V.,"enough, and gets no good from that which he has. If thou desirest to be"
2862,LIB. V.,"beloved, thou must use largess and give for thy love’s sake: if thou"
2863,LIB. V.,"wilt have grace, be gracious, and eschew the disease of Avarice. Some"
2864,LIB. V.,"men have no rest for fear their gold should be stolen, and so some"

2866,LIB. V.,
2867,LIB. V.,"What is this _Jealousy_, my father?"
2868,LIB. V.,
2869,LIB. V.,"It is like a fever, my son, which returns every day. It makes a man"
2870,LIB. V.,"look after his lady wherever she goes, and if she make the least sign"
2871,LIB. V.,"of countenance to another man, he turns it to a cause of quarrel."
2872,LIB. V.,"Nothing can please him that she does. If he goes from home, he leaves"
2873,LIB. V.,"some one to report her doings, and finds fault where there is none. The"
2874,LIB. V.,wife who is married to such a man may well curse the day when the gold
2875,LIB. V.,"was laid upon the book. As the sick man has no appetite for food, so"
2876,LIB. V.,"the jealous man has no appetite for love, and yet like the avaricious"
2877,LIB. V.,he is tormented with the fear of losing his treasure. Love hates
2878,LIB. V.,"nothing more than this fever of which I speak, and to show how grievous"
2879,LIB. V.,"it is, I will tell thee an example. (445-634.)"
2880,LIB. V.,
2881,LIB. V.,"_Vulcan and Venus._ Vulcan the smith had the fair Venus for his wife,"
2882,LIB. V.,whom Mars loved and was beloved again. Jealousy caused Vulcan to spy
2883,LIB. V.,"upon them, and he devised so by his craft that they were caught as they"
2884,LIB. V.,"lay together and bound with chains. He called the gods to see, but was"
2885,LIB. V.,only rebuked for his pains. Hence earthly husbands may learn that by
2886,LIB. V.,Jealousy they bring shame upon themselves. (635-725.)
2887,LIB. V.,
2888,LIB. V.,"This example, my father, is hard to understand. How can such things"
2889,LIB. V.,"happen among the gods, when there is but one God who is Lord of all?"
2890,LIB. V.,How come such gods as these to have a place?
2891,LIB. V.,
2892,LIB. V.,"My son, such gods are received by the unwise in sundry places: I will"
2893,LIB. V.,tell thee how. (726-747.)
2894,LIB. V.,
2895,LIB. V.,747-1970. THE RELIGIONS OF THE WORLD. There were four forms of belief
2896,LIB. V.,before Christ was born.
2897,LIB. V.,
2898,LIB. V.,"The _Chaldees_ worshipped the Sun, Moon and Stars and the Elements,"
2899,LIB. V.,which cannot be gods because they suffer change. (747-786.)
2900,LIB. V.,
2901,LIB. V.,"The _Egyptians_ worshipped beasts, and also three gods and a goddess,"
2902,LIB. V.,"of whom the goddess, Ysis, came from Greece and taught them tillage."
2903,LIB. V.,(787-834.)
2904,LIB. V.,
2905,LIB. V.,The _Greeks_ deified the men who were their rulers or who became
2906,LIB. V.,"famous, as Saturnus king of Crete and Jupiter his son,--such was their"
2907,LIB. V.,"folly. Of gods they had besides these Mars, Apollo, Mercury, Vulcan,"
2908,LIB. V.,"Eolus, Neptune, Pan, Bacchus, Esculapius, Hercules, Pluto, and of"
2909,LIB. V.,"goddesses Sibeles, Juno, Minerva, Pallas, Ceres, Diana, Proserpine;"
2910,LIB. V.,"also Satyrs, Nymphs and Manes,--it would be too long to tell the whole."
2911,LIB. V.,(835-1373.)
2912,LIB. V.,
2913,LIB. V.,"Yes, father, but why have ye said nothing of the god and the goddess of"
2914,LIB. V.,love?
2915,LIB. V.,
2916,LIB. V.,"I have left it for shame, my son, because I am their priest, but since"
2917,LIB. V.,"thou desirest it, I will tell thee. Venus was the daughter of Saturn,"
2918,LIB. V.,and she first taught that love should be common. She had children both
2919,LIB. V.,"by gods and men: she lay with her brother Jupiter and her son Cupid,"
2920,LIB. V.,and she first told women to sell their bodies. Therefore they called
2921,LIB. V.,her the goddess of love and her son the god. (1374-1443.)
2922,LIB. V.,
2923,LIB. V.,"The Greeks took a god to help in whatsoever they had to do. Dindimus,"
2924,LIB. V.,"king of the Bragmans, wrote to Alexander, blaming the Greek faith, and"
2925,LIB. V.,"saying that they had a god for every member of their body, Minerva for"
2926,LIB. V.,"the head, Mercury for the tongue, and so on. (1444-1496.)"
2927,LIB. V.,
2928,LIB. V.,"Idol-worship came first through Cirophanes, who set up an image of his"
2929,LIB. V.,"son, and after that Ninus made a statue of his father Belus, which he"
2930,LIB. V.,"caused to be worshipped, and third came the statue of Apis or Serapis,"
2931,LIB. V.,"who spoke to Alexander in the cave, when he came riding with Candalus."
2932,LIB. V.,(1497-1590.)
2933,LIB. V.,
2934,LIB. V.,"Thus went the misbeliefs of Grece, of Egypt and of Chaldee. Then, as"
2935,LIB. V.,"the book says, God chose a people for himself. Habraham taught his"
2936,LIB. V.,"lineage to worship only the one true God, and after they had multiplied"
2937,LIB. V.,"in Egypt, God delivered them wondrously by Moises and brought them into"
2938,LIB. V.,"the land of promise. But when Christ was born, they failed and fell"
2939,LIB. V.,"away; so that they now live out of God’s grace, dispersed in sundry"
2940,LIB. V.,lands. (1591-1736.)
2941,LIB. V.,
2942,LIB. V.,God sent his Son down from heaven to restore the loss which we suffered
2943,LIB. V.,in Adam: so that original sin was the cause of man’s honour at the
2944,LIB. V.,"last. By this faith only we can attain to Paradise once more, but"
2945,LIB. V.,faith is not enough without good deeds. Therefore be not deceived by
2946,LIB. V.,"Lollardy, which sets the true faith of Christ in doubt. (1737-1824.)"
2947,LIB. V.,
2948,LIB. V.,"Christ wrought first and then taught, so that his words explained his"
2949,LIB. V.,"deeds, but we in these days have the words alone. Our prelates are"
2950,LIB. V.,like that priest who turned away his eyes and let Anthenor steal the
2951,LIB. V.,"Palladion of Troy. Christ died for the faith, but they say that life is"
2952,LIB. V.,"sweet, and they follow only their own ease. Therefore the ship of Peter"
2953,LIB. V.,"is almost lost in the waves, and tares are sown among the corn. Gregory"
2954,LIB. V.,"complains of the sloth of the prelacy, and asks how we shall appear"
2955,LIB. V.,beside the Apostles in the day of Judgement. We shall be like the man
2956,LIB. V.,who hid his lord’s besant and got no increase upon it. We are slow
2957,LIB. V.,"towards our spiritual work, but swift to Avarice, which, as the apostle"
2958,LIB. V.,"says, is idolatry."
2959,LIB. V.,
2960,LIB. V.,"My father, for this which ye have said I shall take the better heed:"
2961,LIB. V.,but now tell me the branches of Avarice as well in love as otherwise.
2962,LIB. V.,(1825-1970.)
2963,LIB. V.,
2964,LIB. V.,"1971-2858. COVEITISE. Avarice has many servants, and one of these is"
2965,LIB. V.,"Coveitise, who is her principal purveyor and makes his gain in every"
2966,LIB. V.,place. He is as the pike who devours the smaller fishes: for him might
2967,LIB. V.,is always right. I will tell thee a tale of the punishment of this
2968,LIB. V.,vice. (1971-2030.)
2969,LIB. V.,
2970,LIB. V.,"_Virgil’s Mirror._ Virgil made a mirror at Rome, wherein the motions"
2971,LIB. V.,of all enemies for thirty miles round might be seen. They of Carthage
2972,LIB. V.,"had war with Rome, and took counsel with the king of Puile how they"
2973,LIB. V.,"might destroy this mirror. Crassus, the Roman Emperor, was above all"
2974,LIB. V.,things covetous. They sent therefore three philosophers to Rome with
2975,LIB. V.,"a great treasure of gold, which they buried in two places secretly."
2976,LIB. V.,These men professed to the Emperor that by dreams they could discover
2977,LIB. V.,"ancient hoards of gold, and first one and then the other of these"
2978,LIB. V.,buried treasures was found. Then the third master announced a yet
2979,LIB. V.,"greater treasure, to be found by mining under the magic mirror. As they"
2980,LIB. V.,"mined, they underset the supports of the mirror with timber, and on a"
2981,LIB. V.,certain night these three set fire to the timber and fled out of the
2982,LIB. V.,"city. So the mirror fell and was destroyed, and Hanybal slew so many"
2983,LIB. V.,"of the Romans in a day, that he filled three bushels with their gold"
2984,LIB. V.,rings. The Romans punished their Emperor by pouring molten gold down
2985,LIB. V.,"his throat, so that his thirst for gold might be quenched. (2031-2224.)"
2986,LIB. V.,
2987,LIB. V.,"Coveitise in a king or in those of his court is an evil thing, my son;"
2988,LIB. V.,"but he who most covets often gains least, and Fortune stands for much"
2989,LIB. V.,as well in courts as elsewhere. (2225-2272.)
2990,LIB. V.,
2991,LIB. V.,_The Two Coffers._ A king heard that his courtiers complained of
2992,LIB. V.,unequal rewards for their service. He resolved to show them that the
2993,LIB. V.,"fault lay not with him, and he caused two coffers to be made in all"
2994,LIB. V.,"respects alike, the one of which he filled with gold and jewels, and"
2995,LIB. V.,the other with straw and stones. He called before him those who had
2996,LIB. V.,"complained, and bade them choose. They chose the worthless coffer,"
2997,LIB. V.,"and he proved to them by this, that if they were not advanced, their"
2998,LIB. V.,fortune only was to blame. (2273-2390.)
2999,LIB. V.,
3000,LIB. V.,Like this is the story of the _Two Beggars_ whom the Emperor Frederick
3001,LIB. V.,"heard disputing about riches, and for whom he prepared two pasties, one"
3002,LIB. V.,containing a capon and the other full of florins. (2391-2441.)
3003,LIB. V.,
3004,LIB. V.,"Thus it is often with love: though thou covet, yet shalt thou not"
3005,LIB. V.,obtain more than fortune has allotted thee. Yet there are those that
3006,LIB. V.,"covet every woman whom they see, finding something to their liking in"
3007,LIB. V.,each. They can no more judge in matters of love than a blind man can
3008,LIB. V.,judge of colours.
3009,LIB. V.,
3010,LIB. V.,"My father, I had rather be as poor as Job than covet in such a manner."
3011,LIB. V.,"There is one whom I would have, and no more. (2442-2513.)"
3012,LIB. V.,
3013,LIB. V.,There are some also who choose a woman not for her face nor yet for her
3014,LIB. V.,"virtue, but only for her riches."
3015,LIB. V.,
3016,LIB. V.,"Such am not I, father. I could love my lady no more than I do, if"
3017,LIB. V.,she were as rich as Candace or Pantasilee; and I think no man is so
3018,LIB. V.,covetous that he would not set his heart upon her more than upon gold.
3019,LIB. V.,"To one who knows what love is, my lady seems to have all the graces of"
3020,LIB. V.,"nature, and she is also the mirror and example of goodness. It were"
3021,LIB. V.,better to love her than to love one who has a million of gold. I say
3022,LIB. V.,"not that she is poor, for she has enough of worldly goods; yet my heart"
3023,LIB. V.,has never been drawn to her but for pure love’s sake.
3024,LIB. V.,
3025,LIB. V.,"It is well, my son, for no other love will last. Hear now an example of"
3026,LIB. V.,how coveitise prevailed over love. (2514-2642.)
3027,LIB. V.,
3028,LIB. V.,"_The King and his Steward’s Wife._ There was a king of Puile, whom his"
3029,LIB. V.,"physicians counselled to take a fair young woman to his bed, and he"
3030,LIB. V.,bade his steward provide. The steward had a wife whom he had married
3031,LIB. V.,"for lucre and not for love, and he set his coveitise before his honour."
3032,LIB. V.,Having received a hundred pounds from the king to procure him the
3033,LIB. V.,"woman, he brought at night his own wife, against her will. Before the"
3034,LIB. V.,"morning he came and desired to take her away, but the king refused to"
3035,LIB. V.,"let her go, and at length the steward was compelled to tell him who she"
3036,LIB. V.,was. The king threatened him with death if he remained one day longer
3037,LIB. V.,"in the land, and afterwards he took the woman for his wife. (2643-2825.)"
3038,LIB. V.,
3039,LIB. V.,"Beware, my son, of this, for it is a great evil when marriage is made"
3040,LIB. V.,for lucre.
3041,LIB. V.,
3042,LIB. V.,"Father, so think I, and yet riches may sometimes be a help to love. Now"
3043,LIB. V.,"ask me more, if more there be. (2826-2858.)"
3044,LIB. V.,
3045,LIB. V.,"2859-4382. FALSE WITNESS and PERJURY. Coveitise has two counsellors,"
3046,LIB. V.,"False Witness and Perjury, who make gain for their master by lying. So"
3047,LIB. V.,"lovers often swear faithful service to a woman, and it is all treachery."
3048,LIB. V.,
3049,LIB. V.,"I am not one of these, father: my thought is not discordant to my word."
3050,LIB. V.,"I may safely swear that I love my lady, and if other men should bear"
3051,LIB. V.,"witness of it for me, there would be no false swearing."
3052,LIB. V.,
3053,LIB. V.,"My son, I will tell thee a tale to show that False Witness is at last"
3054,LIB. V.,found out. (2859-2960.)
3055,LIB. V.,
3056,LIB. V.,"_Achilles and Deidamia._ Thetis, in order that her son Achilles might"
3057,LIB. V.,"not go to Troy, disguised him as a girl and put him to dwell with the"
3058,LIB. V.,"daughters of king Lichomede. There he was the bedfellow of Deidamie,"
3059,LIB. V.,and so her maidenhead was lost. The Greeks in the meantime assailed
3060,LIB. V.,"Troy in vain, and it was told them by divination that unless they had"
3061,LIB. V.,"Achilles, their war would be endless. Ulixes therefore was sent with"
3062,LIB. V.,"Diomede to bring him, and coming to the kingdom of Lichomede he could"
3063,LIB. V.,not distinguish Achilles from the rest. Then he set forth the gifts
3064,LIB. V.,"which he had brought for the women, and among them a knight’s harness"
3065,LIB. V.,"brightly burnished. Achilles left all the rest and chose this, and then"
3066,LIB. V.,"he came forth armed in it before them. He was glad enough, but not"
3067,LIB. V.,"so Lichomede, who had been so overseen. Thus came out the treachery"
3068,LIB. V.,"of False Witness; and if Thetis, who was a goddess, thus deceived"
3069,LIB. V.,"Deidamie, what security have women against the untruth of lovers?"
3070,LIB. V.,(2961-3218.)
3071,LIB. V.,
3072,LIB. V.,"My father, tell me some tale about Perjury."
3073,LIB. V.,
3074,LIB. V.,"I will tell thee, my son, how Jason did to Medea, as it is written in"
3075,LIB. V.,the book of Troy. (3219-3246.)
3076,LIB. V.,
3077,LIB. V.,_Jason and Medea._ Jason was the nephew of king Peleus; and desiring
3078,LIB. V.,"to achieve adventures and see strange lands, he took a company of"
3079,LIB. V.,"knights, and among them Hercules, and sailed to the isle of Colchos to"
3080,LIB. V.,"win the fleece of gold. On the way they touched at Troy, where the king"
3081,LIB. V.,"Lamedon treated them discourteously, and then they came to Colchos."
3082,LIB. V.,"Oëtes, who was king there, endeavoured to persuade Jason to leave his"
3083,LIB. V.,"adventure, but without success; and then the princess Medea entertained"
3084,LIB. V.,him with welcome. Moved by love of him she offered him her help to win
3085,LIB. V.,"the fleece, and he plighted his troth to her and swore that he would"
3086,LIB. V.,"never part from her. She taught him what to do, and gave him a magic"
3087,LIB. V.,"ring and an ointment, telling him also what charms and prayers to use,"
3088,LIB. V.,"so that he might slay the serpent which guarded the fleece, yoke the"
3089,LIB. V.,"fire-breathing oxen to the plough, sow the teeth of the serpent and"
3090,LIB. V.,slay the knights who should spring up.
3091,LIB. V.,
3092,LIB. V.,"He took his leave of her, and passing over the water in a boat did as"
3093,LIB. V.,Medea bade him. Returning with the fleece he was welcomed back by Medea
3094,LIB. V.,"and the rest, and that night he took Medea and her treasure on board"
3095,LIB. V.,his ship and they sailed away to Greece. It was vain to pursue: they
3096,LIB. V.,were gone.
3097,LIB. V.,
3098,LIB. V.,"When they came to Greece, all received them with joy, and these lovers"
3099,LIB. V.,"lived together, till they had two sons. Medea with her charms renewed"
3100,LIB. V.,"the youth of Eson, Jason’s father, and brought him back to the likeness"
3101,LIB. V.,of a young man of twenty years. No woman could have shown more love
3102,LIB. V.,"to a man than she did to Jason; and yet, when he bare the crown after"
3103,LIB. V.,"his uncle Peleus was dead, he broke the oath which he had sworn and"
3104,LIB. V.,"took Creusa, daughter of king Creon, to wife. Medea sent her the gift"
3105,LIB. V.,"of a mantle, from which fire sprang out and consumed her; then in the"
3106,LIB. V.,"presence of Jason she killed his two sons, and was gone to the court of"
3107,LIB. V.,Pallas above before he could draw his sword to slay her. Thus mayest
3108,LIB. V.,thou see what sorrow it brings to swear an oath in love which is not
3109,LIB. V.,sooth. (3247-4229.)
3110,LIB. V.,
3111,LIB. V.,"I have heard before this how Jason won the fleece, but tell me now who"
3112,LIB. V.,brought that fleece first to Colchos.
3113,LIB. V.,
3114,LIB. V.,"_Phrixus and Helle._ King Athemas by his first wife had two children,"
3115,LIB. V.,Frixus and Hellen; but his second wife Yno hated them and contrived a
3116,LIB. V.,device against them. She sowed the land with sodden wheat; and when no
3117,LIB. V.,"harvest came, she caused the priests of Ceres to say that the land must"
3118,LIB. V.,be delivered of these children. The queen bade men throw the children
3119,LIB. V.,"into the sea; but Juno saved them, and provided a sheep with golden"
3120,LIB. V.,"fleece, which swam with them over the waves. Hellen for dread fell off"
3121,LIB. V.,"his back and so was lost, but her brother was borne over to the isle of"
3122,LIB. V.,"Colchos, and there the fleece was set, which was the cause why Jason"
3123,LIB. V.,was so forsworn.
3124,LIB. V.,
3125,LIB. V.,"My father, he who breaks his troth thus is worthy neither to love nor"
3126,LIB. V.,to be beloved. (4230-4382.)
3127,LIB. V.,
3128,LIB. V.,"4383-4670. USURY. Another of the brood of Avarice is Usury, whose"
3129,LIB. V.,"brokers run about like hounds, hunting after gain. He has unequal"
3130,LIB. V.,"weights and measures, and he takes back a bean where he has lent a pea."
3131,LIB. V.,"So there are many lovers, who though the love they gave will hardly"
3132,LIB. V.,"weigh a mite, yet ask a pound again; and often by the help of their"
3133,LIB. V.,brokers these buy love for little.
3134,LIB. V.,
3135,LIB. V.,"My father, I am not guilty of this. That which I give is far more than"
3136,LIB. V.,"ever I take again. Usury will have double, but I would be content with"
3137,LIB. V.,"half. If my lady reward me not the better, I can never recover my"
3138,LIB. V.,"cost. Nor yet have I ever used brokers in love. But thought is free,"
3139,LIB. V.,"my father, and to me it seems that my lady herself cannot be excused"
3140,LIB. V.,of this that ye call Usury. For one glance of her eye she has my whole
3141,LIB. V.,"heart, and she will render me nothing again. She has all my love and I"
3142,LIB. V.,"go loveless: she says not so much as ‘Thanks.’ Myself I can acquit, and"
3143,LIB. V.,"if she be to blame in this, I pray God to give her grace to amend."
3144,LIB. V.,
3145,LIB. V.,"My son, thou speakest ill in that thou accusest thy lady. She may"
3146,LIB. V.,be such that her one glance is worth thy heart many times reckoned.
3147,LIB. V.,"Moreover in love the balance is not even: though thy love weigh more,"
3148,LIB. V.,thou must not ask for return as a debt that is due; for Love is lord
3149,LIB. V.,"and does after his own will. Be patient, and perchance all may turn to"
3150,LIB. V.,good. I am well pleased that thou hast used in love no brokerage to
3151,LIB. V.,deceive. (4383-4572.)
3152,LIB. V.,
3153,LIB. V.,_Echo._ Brokers of love receive at last that which they have deserved.
3154,LIB. V.,"Juno had Echo among her maidens, and she was of accord with Jupiter to"
3155,LIB. V.,get him new loves and to blind her lady’s eyes. When Juno understood
3156,LIB. V.,"this, she reproved her and took vengeance, sending her to dwell in the"
3157,LIB. V.,woods and hills and repeat always the sound of the voices that came to
3158,LIB. V.,her ears. (4573-4652.)
3159,LIB. V.,
3160,LIB. V.,"If ever thou be wedded man, my son, use no such means as this."
3161,LIB. V.,
3162,LIB. V.,4671-4884. PARSIMONY or SCARCENESS. Another there is whom Avarice has
3163,LIB. V.,"for the keeper of his house, and his name is Scarceness. It is easier"
3164,LIB. V.,to flay the flint than to get from him the value of a rush to help
3165,LIB. V.,"another. How is it with thee, my son? Hast thou been scarce or free"
3166,LIB. V.,towards thy love?
3167,LIB. V.,
3168,LIB. V.,"My father, if I had all the treasure of Cresus or the gold of Octovien,"
3169,LIB. V.,"I would give it all to her, if I might. But indeed I never gave her any"
3170,LIB. V.,"gift, for from me she will not take any, lest I should have some small"
3171,LIB. V.,"cause of hope. Yet she takes from others and gives again, so that all"
3172,LIB. V.,"speak well of her. As for me, she knows that my heart and all that I"
3173,LIB. V.,have is at her command and will be while I live. (4671-4780.)
3174,LIB. V.,
3175,LIB. V.,"_Babio and Croceus._ Scarceness accords not with love, and often a man"
3176,LIB. V.,"has lost the coat for the hood. With gift a man may do much, and meed"
3177,LIB. V.,"keeps love in house. Babio had a love named Viola, who was both fair"
3178,LIB. V.,"and free; but he was a niggard, and so she was ill served. Croceus,"
3179,LIB. V.,"liberal and amorous, came in her way, and she left Babio loveless."

3186,LIB. V.,
3187,LIB. V.,4885-5504. INGRATITUDE or UNKINDNESS. This is a vice which repays no
3188,LIB. V.,"service, and when he has received a barnful, grudges to give a grain in"
3189,LIB. V.,"return. God and Nature both condemn this vice, and even a beast loves"
3190,LIB. V.,"the creature who does him kindness, as this tale will show by example."

3194,LIB. V.,"a forest, fell into a pit. He cried for help all day, but none heard"
3195,LIB. V.,"till evening, when one Bardus, a woodcutter, came by with his ass, and"
3196,LIB. V.,heard Adrian promise to give half his goods to him who should help
3197,LIB. V.,"him. He let down a rope, and first an ape and then a serpent was drawn"
3198,LIB. V.,"up by it. Bardus was terrified, but still the voice implored help,"
3199,LIB. V.,and at length Adrian was drawn up. At once this lord departed without
3200,LIB. V.,"thanks, and threatened Bardus with vengeance if ever he should claim"
3201,LIB. V.,"the promise. The poor man went home, not daring to speak more, and on"
3202,LIB. V.,"the next day, going to get wood, he found that the ape had requited his"
3203,LIB. V.,"kindness by gathering for him a great heap of sticks, and so continued"
3204,LIB. V.,to do day by day; and the serpent brought him a precious stone in her
3205,LIB. V.,mouth. This last he sold to a jeweller and afterwards found it again
3206,LIB. V.,"in his purse, and as often as he sold it, the same thing followed. At"
3207,LIB. V.,"length this came to be known, and the Emperor heard of it. Calling"
3208,LIB. V.,"Bardus before him he listened to his tale, and gave judgement that"
3209,LIB. V.,Adrian should fulfil his promise. (4937-5162.)
3210,LIB. V.,
3211,LIB. V.,"Flee this vice, my son, for many lovers are thus unkind."
3212,LIB. V.,
3213,LIB. V.,"Alas, father, that such a man should be, who when he has had what he"
3214,LIB. V.,"would of love, can find it in his heart to be false. As for me, I dare"
3215,LIB. V.,"not say that my lady is guilty of this Unkindness, but I for my part am"
3216,LIB. V.,free.
3217,LIB. V.,
3218,LIB. V.,"Thou must not complain of thy lady, my son. Perchance thy desire is not"
3219,LIB. V.,such as she in honour can grant. It is well that thou art not guilty of

3226,LIB. V.,"son of the king of Athens, and he went with the rest to Crete."
3227,LIB. V.,"Adriagne, daughter of Minos, loved him, and she gave him help to slay"
3228,LIB. V.,"the monster. Then he took her away with him by ship, and her sister"
3229,LIB. V.,"Fedra went in their company. They rested in the isle of Chio, and there"
3230,LIB. V.,"he left Adriagne sleeping, and sailed away with Fedra. Thus by his"
3231,LIB. V.,"ingratitude and falsehood he broke the law of love, and evil came of it"
3232,LIB. V.,afterwards. (5231-5495.)

3237,LIB. V.,
3238,LIB. V.,"_Tereus._ Pandion, king of Athens, had two daughters, Progne and"
3239,LIB. V.,"Philomene. Progne was married to Tereus, king of Thrace, and desiring"
3240,LIB. V.,"to see her sister, she sent Tereus to Athens to bring her. Coming back"

3247,LIB. V.,"delivered her sister, and together they concerted vengeance, with"
3248,LIB. V.,"prayers to Venus, Cupid and Apollo. Progne slew the son which she had"
3249,LIB. V.,"by Tereus and served up his flesh to him for meat, and when he would"
3250,LIB. V.,"have pursued the sisters to take vengeance, the gods transformed them"
3251,LIB. V.,"all three, Philomene to a nightingale, which complains ever for her"

3262,LIB. V.,"which he can take on the high-roads, in woods and in fields. So there"
3263,LIB. V.,"are lovers, who, if they find a woman in a lonely place, will take a"
3264,LIB. V.,"part of her wares, no matter who she may be; and the wife who sits at"
3265,LIB. V.,home waiting for her husband’s return from hunting will hear from him
3266,LIB. V.,"nothing of this, but only how his hounds have run or his hawks have"

3270,LIB. V.,"went upon the shore, Neptune thought to rob her of the treasure which"
3271,LIB. V.,"passes all others and is called the maidenhead. She prayed to Pallas,"
3272,LIB. V.,"and by her help escaped from him in the form of a crow, rejoicing more"
3273,LIB. V.,to keep her maidenhead white under the blackness of the feathers than
3274,LIB. V.,to lose it and be adorned with the fairest pearls. (6145-6217.)

3276,LIB. V.,"_Calistona._ King Lichaon had a daughter Calistona, who desired ever to"
3277,LIB. V.,be a maiden and dwelt with the nymphs of Diane. Jupiter by craft stole
3278,LIB. V.,"her maidenhead, and Diane discovering it reproached her, so that she"
3279,LIB. V.,"fled away. She was delivered of a son, Archas, but Juno in vengeance"
3280,LIB. V.,transformed her into a bear. In that likeness she met her son in the
3281,LIB. V.,"forest, and he bent his bow against her, but Jupiter ordained for them"
3282,LIB. V.,both so that they were saved from misfortune. (6225-6337.)

3284,LIB. V.,"Such Robbery, my son, is ever to be avoided, and I will tell thee how"

3286,LIB. V.,
3287,LIB. V.,"Valerius tells how the Emperor did honour to the virgin, when he met"
3288,LIB. V.,"her in the way, and we hear also of _Phirinus_, who thrust out his eyes"
3289,LIB. V.,in order that he might the better keep his virginity.
3290,LIB. V.,
3291,LIB. V.,"_Valentinian_ moreover, the Emperor, in his old age rejoiced more that"
3292,LIB. V.,"he had overcome his flesh, than that he had conquered his enemies in"
3293,LIB. V.,battle. (6338-6428.)
3294,LIB. V.,
3295,LIB. V.,"Evil follows when Virginity is taken away in lawless manner, as when"
3296,LIB. V.,"Agamenon took Criseide from the city of Lesbon, and plague came upon"
3297,LIB. V.,"the host, so that they sent her back with prayer and sacrifice."
3298,LIB. V.,

3300,LIB. V.,
3301,LIB. V.,"6493-6960. STEALTH. Coveitise has also a servant called Stealth, who"
3302,LIB. V.,"takes his prey in secret, coming into houses at night, or cutting"
3303,LIB. V.,"purses by day. Like the dog that comes back from worrying sheep, he"
3304,LIB. V.,"looks all innocent, so that no man knows what he has done. There are"
3305,LIB. V.,"lovers also who take by stealth, either kisses or other things. Hast"
3306,LIB. V.,thou done so? (6493-6561.)
3307,LIB. V.,
3308,LIB. V.,"I dare not, father, for my heart is hers and will not do anything"
3309,LIB. V.,against her. Moreover Danger is so watchful a warden that none can
3310,LIB. V.,"steal anything from her. Strong locks make thieves into honest men, and"
3311,LIB. V.,by no lying in wait can I slip through his guard. Yet at night I often
3312,LIB. V.,"wake when others sleep, and I look out from my window upon the houses"
3313,LIB. V.,"round, and mark the chamber where she lies. I stand there long in the"
3314,LIB. V.,"cold and wish for some device of sorcery, whereby I might enter that"
3315,LIB. V.,chamber and steal. It brings me ease for the time to think of these
3316,LIB. V.,"things, but it profits me nothing in the end. It is for you to judge if"
3317,LIB. V.,I deserve penance for this or no.
3318,LIB. V.,
3319,LIB. V.,"Stealth does little good, my son, in the end. I will tell thee a tale"
3320,LIB. V.,from Ovid of stealth which was done by day. (6562-6712.)
3321,LIB. V.,
3322,LIB. V.,"_Leucothoe._ Phebus loved Leuchotoe, whom her mother kept close in"
3323,LIB. V.,chamber and seldom allowed to go forth. On a day he came in suddenly
3324,LIB. V.,"through her chamber wall and stole her maidenhead. Her father, when he"
3325,LIB. V.,"knew, dared not take quarrel with Phebus, but without pity he caused"
3326,LIB. V.,her to be buried alive; and Phebus wrought so that she sprang up as a
3327,LIB. V.,"golden flower, which ever follows the sun. (6713-6783.)"
3328,LIB. V.,
3329,LIB. V.,"No wonder that this came to evil, my father, because it was done in"
3330,LIB. V.,"broad day, but lovers sometimes have kept their thefts more secret."

3333,LIB. V.,"_Hercules and Faunus._ Hercules and Eolen, going together on a"
3334,LIB. V.,"pilgrimage towards Rome, rested in a cave. Faunus, with Saba and her"
3335,LIB. V.,"nymphs, were in a wood hard by, and Faunus, having had a sight of"
3336,LIB. V.,"Eolen, thought to come by night and steal. Hercules and Eolen went to"
3337,LIB. V.,"rest on separate beds, having to offer sacrifice on the morrow, and"
3338,LIB. V.,"as they had exchanged clothes with one another in sport, she had his"
3339,LIB. V.,"mace by her and his clothes upon her bed, and he her wimple round his"
3340,LIB. V.,face and her mantle over him. The servants slept like drunken swine.
3341,LIB. V.,"Faunus came into the cave, and feeling the mace and lion’s skin, he"
3342,LIB. V.,left her bed alone and went over to the other. Hercules seized him and

3348,LIB. V.,"6961-7609. SACRILEGE. God has laid down a law that men shall not steal,"
3349,LIB. V.,"but work for their sustenance, and yet there are those who will even"
3350,LIB. V.,"take the goods of holy Church, and this is called Sacrilege. [There"
3351,LIB. V.,"are three kinds of Sacrilege, namely, theft of holy thing from holy"
3352,LIB. V.,"place, of common thing from holy place, or of holy thing from common"
3353,LIB. V.,place. (7015*-7029*.)] Three princes especially in old days were guilty
3354,LIB. V.,"of this, Antiochus, Nabuzardan and Nabugodonosor. This last wrought"
3355,LIB. V.,"sacrilege in the temple at Jerusalem, and Baltazar his heir paid the"
3356,LIB. V.,"penalty. (6961-7031.) [A tale is told of one _Lucius_ at Rome, who"
3357,LIB. V.,"robbed the statue of Apollo of a ring, a golden mantle and a golden"
3358,LIB. V.,"beard, and excused himself, saying that he took the ring because it"
3359,LIB. V.,"was held out towards him and offered, the mantle because it was too"
3360,LIB. V.,"heavy for summer and too cold for winter, and the beard because it was"
3361,LIB. V.,"not fit that Apollo should have a beard, when his father, who stood"
3362,LIB. V.,"near him, was beardless. Thus can men feign and excuse themselves."
3363,LIB. V.,(7105*-7209*.)]
3364,LIB. V.,
3365,LIB. V.,There are lovers who at mass will whisper in their lady’s ear or take
3366,LIB. V.,from her hand a ring or glove. Some go to churches to seek out women
3367,LIB. V.,"and to show themselves there in fresh array, looking round upon them"
3368,LIB. V.,"all and sighing, so that each thinks it is for her; and yet such a man"
3369,LIB. V.,"loves none of them, but goes there only to steal their hearts. All this"
3370,LIB. V.,is Sacrilege.
3371,LIB. V.,
3372,LIB. V.,"My father, I do not so: but when my lady goes to matins or to mass,"
3373,LIB. V.,"thither I go also; and then my looks are for her alone, and my prayers"
3374,LIB. V.,are that God may change her heart. I watch and wait to steal from her a
3375,LIB. V.,"word or look, and when I lead her up to the offering with my hand about"
3376,LIB. V.,"her waist, I win a touch as well. Except in such things I have done no"
3377,LIB. V.,"Sacrilege, but it is my power and not my will that fails."
3378,LIB. V.,
3379,LIB. V.,"Thy will is to blame, my son; the rest that thou hast said is of little"
3380,LIB. V.,account. Yet all things have their time and place: the church is for
3381,LIB. V.,prayer and the chamber for other things. That thou mayest know how
3382,LIB. V.,"Sacrilege is punished, I will spend on thee a tale. (7032-7194.)"

3384,LIB. V.,"_Paris and Helen._ Lamedon was king of Troy, and against him the"
3385,LIB. V.,"Greeks made war, and they slew him and destroyed his city. With other"
3386,LIB. V.,"prisoners they took the fair Esiona his daughter, and she was given"
3387,LIB. V.,"to Thelamon. Priamus, son of Lamedon, built up Troy again, and with"
3388,LIB. V.,advice of his parliament he sent Antenor to demand back Esiona. The
3389,LIB. V.,"Greeks and Thelamon stoutly refused his request, and Priamus called his"
3390,LIB. V.,"parliament again to debate of war or peace. Hector spoke for peace,"
3391,LIB. V.,"alleging grounds of prudence, though he was ever the first in war; but"
3392,LIB. V.,"his brother Paris gave his voice for avenging the wrong. He told how,"
3393,LIB. V.,"as he slept beside a well, three goddesses came before him in a vision,"
3394,LIB. V.,"and Venus, to whom he assigned the golden apple which was the prize of"
3395,LIB. V.,"beauty, had promised to give him in Greece the fairest woman of all the"
3396,LIB. V.,"earth. Paris then went forth to Greece, though Cassandra and Helenus"
3397,LIB. V.,lamented for the evil that was to come. Landed in an isle he met the
3398,LIB. V.,"queen Heleine, who came to do sacrifice there to Venus, and he stole"
3399,LIB. V.,"her heart. Heleine was in the temple all the night, offering prayer"
3400,LIB. V.,"to Venus, and Paris came all suddenly and bore her to his ship. This"
3401,LIB. V.,"Sacrilege was the cause why the Greeks laid siege about Troy, and at"

3404,LIB. V.,"Note also how Achilles saw Polixena in the temple of Apollo, and how"

3411,LIB. V.,
3412,LIB. V.,7641-7844. PRODIGALITY and LARGESS. Virtue lies between two extremes:
3413,LIB. V.,"here we see Avarice and Prodigality, and between them Liberality or"
3414,LIB. V.,"Largess, which holds the middle path between too much and too little."
3415,LIB. V.,"Where Largess guides a man, he does what is right both to God and the"
3416,LIB. V.,"world, and God rewards him with the gift of heaven. The world gives"
3417,LIB. V.,"ever to him who hath; but it is better to give than to receive, to have"
3418,LIB. V.,thine own good than to crave that of others. ‘If thy good suffice thee
3419,LIB. V.,"not, then refrain thy desires and suffice to thy good.’ Charity begins"

3505,LIB. VI.,So he who is delicate in love cannot content himself with what he has;
3506,LIB. VI.,"but though he have a fair wife, yet he will set his heart on others,"
3507,LIB. VI.,"and though his lady make him cheer, he must have more than she can with"
3508,LIB. VI.,honour give.
3509,LIB. VI.,
3510,LIB. VI.,"I am not guilty of this, father: I would be satisfied if I could be fed"
3511,LIB. VI.,"at all, except with woe. Yet some dainties I pick which please me for"
3512,LIB. VI.,the time. (617-752.)
3513,LIB. VI.,
3514,LIB. VI.,"My sight is fed with dainties when I look upon her face and form, yet"
3515,LIB. VI.,"it may never be fed to the full, but always longs for more. (753-826.)"
3516,LIB. VI.,
3517,LIB. VI.,My hearing has a dainty feast when men commend her worthiness and
3518,LIB. VI.,"grace, and above all when I hear her speak, for her words are to me"
3519,LIB. VI.,"like the winds of the South. Or again, I feed my ears with tales of"
3520,LIB. VI.,"those who loved before I was born, of Ydoine and Amadas and of many"
3521,LIB. VI.,"more, and I think how sorrow endures but for a time. (827-898.)"
3522,LIB. VI.,
3523,LIB. VI.,"Finally, I have a cook whose name is Thought, who keeps his pots ever"
3524,LIB. VI.,"boiling with fancy and desire, and sets before me on the table all the"
3525,LIB. VI.,pleasant sights that I have seen and words that I have heard. Yet it
3526,LIB. VI.,"is no full meal, but one of woulds and wishes, so that the food I have"
3527,LIB. VI.,"does me little good, and serves only to keep off starvation, till I"
3528,LIB. VI.,have the feast which shall satisfy my hunger. (899-938.)
3529,LIB. VI.,
3530,LIB. VI.,"Such are my three delights, and I take my food thus of thinking,"
3531,LIB. VI.,"hearing and seeing, as a plover does of air. By Delicacy such as this I"
3532,LIB. VI.,hope that I do no Gluttony.
3533,LIB. VI.,
3534,LIB. VI.,"It is in small things only that thou hast thy delight, my son; but"
3535,LIB. VI.,remember always that the delights of the body do grievance to the soul.
3536,LIB. VI.,(939-974.)
3537,LIB. VI.,
3538,LIB. VI.,"_Dives and Lazarus._ Christ tells a tale against this vice, which is"
3539,LIB. VI.,"read in Latin, but for the better knowledge of the truth I will declare"
3540,LIB. VI.,"it in English. Christ saith, &c. (975-1109.)"
3541,LIB. VI.,
3542,LIB. VI.,"Thus, my son, he who follows Delicacy and gives no alms shall fall"
3543,LIB. VI.,into distress. He who has power over the good things of this world may
3544,LIB. VI.,"wear the richest ornaments and eat the choicest food, yet he must put"
3545,LIB. VI.,"away Delicacy, if he would not starve his soul while feeding his body."
3546,LIB. VI.,(1110-1150.)
3547,LIB. VI.,
3548,LIB. VI.,"_Nero_ followed his lusts against nature, and in regard to Delicacy he"
3549,LIB. VI.,wrought a subtle thing to know how his stomach fared. He chose three
3550,LIB. VI.,men to eat and drink at his table. On a certain day after meat he
3551,LIB. VI.,"caused one to ride, another to walk, and the third to sleep, and after"
3552,LIB. VI.,"this he killed them, in order that he might see which had best digested"
3553,LIB. VI.,his food.
3554,LIB. VI.,
3555,LIB. VI.,"He refrained from nothing that was pleasant to him, and above all he"
3556,LIB. VI.,"set his heart on women, so that he spared neither wife nor maid. So"
3557,LIB. VI.,drunk was he with his lusts. (1151-1226.)
3558,LIB. VI.,
3559,LIB. VI.,Delicacy and Drunkenness go together and pass all bounds of reason.
3560,LIB. VI.,Thus too Love is at times so unrestrained that he takes no heed of
3561,LIB. VI.,"God’s law, but calls in the powers of heaven and earth and hell to"
3562,LIB. VI.,achieve his purpose. (1227-1260.)
3563,LIB. VI.,
3564,LIB. VI.,1261-2407. SORCERY. There is nothing that love will not dare. He
3565,LIB. VI.,"follows no law but his own, and goes forth like Bayard the blind horse,"
3566,LIB. VI.,"till he fall into the ditch. Thus at times he follows Sorcery, whether"
3567,LIB. VI.,"Geomance, Ydromance, Piromance or Nigromance, with all the craft both"
3568,LIB. VI.,of invocation of spirits and of natural magic.
3569,LIB. VI.,
3570,LIB. VI.,"I know nothing of this, father; but to win my lady I would once have"
3571,LIB. VI.,"done all that might be done, whether in hell or heaven."
3572,LIB. VI.,
3573,LIB. VI.,"That goes very near, my son: but I warn thee that he who does so is"
3574,LIB. VI.,"beguiled at last, and that Sorcery has no good end. (1261-1390.)"
3575,LIB. VI.,
3576,LIB. VI.,_Ulysses and Telegonus._ Of those that were at Troy Uluxes had a name
3577,LIB. VI.,above all for craft and magic arts. This king was vexed by storms as
3578,LIB. VI.,"he returned, and in spite of needle and stone his ship was driven upon"
3579,LIB. VI.,"the strand of Cilly, where he found two queens, Calipsa and Circes."
3580,LIB. VI.,These were sorceresses and they changed many of his men to the form
3581,LIB. VI.,"of beasts, but he overcame them with his sorceries, and at length he"
3582,LIB. VI.,"took his course for home, leaving Circes with child. His wife and all"
3583,LIB. VI.,"his people rejoiced at his home-coming, but when a man is most in his"
3584,LIB. VI.,"prosperity, then fortune makes him soonest fall. He had a dream, as he"
3585,LIB. VI.,"lay upon his bed, and he seemed to see a form of heavenly beauty. He"
3586,LIB. VI.,"embraced that image and it embraced him again, and it said to him: ‘Our"
3587,LIB. VI.,acquaintance shall be hereafter to our sorrow: one of us two shall take
3588,LIB. VI.,his death from this love in which we now rejoice.’ It showed him then
3589,LIB. VI.,"a sign, three fishes wrought upon a pennon, and so all suddenly went"
3590,LIB. VI.,forth from him.
3591,LIB. VI.,
3592,LIB. VI.,"Uluxes started from sleep, and making his calculations upon this, he"
3593,LIB. VI.,judged that the danger was to be feared from his son Thelamachus.
3594,LIB. VI.,"Him therefore he shut up within castle wall, and he made for himself"
3595,LIB. VI.,a stronghold and set his servants to keep guard. But none can make
3596,LIB. VI.,"resistance against his fate: Thelogonus, his son by Circes, came to"
3597,LIB. VI.,"find his father, bearing as his ensign a pennon with three fishes upon"
3598,LIB. VI.,"his spear, and he came to this stronghold of Uluxes. The guards denied"
3599,LIB. VI.,"him entrance and an affray arose at the gate. The king came forth, and"
3600,LIB. VI.,"Thelogonus cast his spear at him, not knowing who he was. Uluxes was"
3601,LIB. VI.,"wounded to death, but he recognized the figure of his dream and the"
3602,LIB. VI.,"sign upon the pennon, and embraced his son, commending him to the care"
3603,LIB. VI.,of Thelamachus before he died.
3604,LIB. VI.,
3605,LIB. VI.,"Lo, what evil came to him of Sorcery: by Sorcery he begat his son,"
3606,LIB. VI.,and that which was done against nature was against nature avenged.
3607,LIB. VI.,(1391-1788.)
3608,LIB. VI.,
3609,LIB. VI.,"_Nectanabus._ The king of Egypt, Nectanabus, a great magician, fled"
3610,LIB. VI.,from his enemies to Macedoine. In the chief city there the queen
3611,LIB. VI.,Olimpias kept the feast of her nativity and rode forth to be seen by
3612,LIB. VI.,"the people. Nectanabus stood with the others, and gazed upon her so"
3613,LIB. VI.,"steadfastly, that the queen sent for him and asked him who he was. He"
3614,LIB. VI.,"replied that he was one who had a message for her, which must be said"
3615,LIB. VI.,"in private. She appointed a time, and he told her how the god Amos of"
3616,LIB. VI.,Lybia desired to be her bedfellow and would beget a child of her who
3617,LIB. VI.,should subdue the whole earth. To prove his words he caused her by his
3618,LIB. VI.,"magic to have a vision, which she took for prophecy; and so at length,"
3619,LIB. VI.,coming in the person of the god and transforming himself into various
3620,LIB. VI.,"shapes, he had his will of her and begat a son. Nectanabus caused"
3621,LIB. VI.,"Philip the king, being from home, to have a vision whereby he supposed"
3622,LIB. VI.,"that a god had lain with his wife, and returning he found her with"
3623,LIB. VI.,"child. Still he doubted, but by further signs and wonders Nectanabus"
3624,LIB. VI.,caused him to forget his jealousy. Amid portents of earthquake and of
3625,LIB. VI.,"tempest the child was born, and his name was called Alexander. He grew"
3626,LIB. VI.,"up, and Aristotle taught him philosophy, while Nectanabus instructed"
3627,LIB. VI.,"him in astronomy. On a certain night, when they were upon a tower"
3628,LIB. VI.,"observing the stars, Nectanabus prophesied by them that his own death"
3629,LIB. VI.,"should be by the hands of his son. Alexander, to prove that he lied,"
3630,LIB. VI.,"threw him from the tower to the ground, asking what was the use of his"
3631,LIB. VI.,art if he could not prophesy his own fate rightly. Nectanabus made
3632,LIB. VI.,"known the truth, and Alexander was sorry, and told his mother how it"
3633,LIB. VI.,"was. Thus he died and was buried, and this was the reward of Sorcery."
3634,LIB. VI.,(1789-2366.)
3635,LIB. VI.,
3636,LIB. VI.,_Zoroaster_ too and _Saul_ came to evil by Sorcery. I counsel thee
3637,LIB. VI.,"never to use this, my son. (2367-2400.)"
3638,LIB. VI.,
3639,LIB. VI.,"I will not, father. But I beseech you tell me something of that"
3640,LIB. VI.,"Philosophy which, as ye said, Aristotle taught to Alexander: for to"
3641,LIB. VI.,hear of something new might ease my pain.
3642,LIB. VI.,
3643,LIB. VI.,"Thou sayest well; but I, who am of the school of Venus, know not much"
3644,LIB. VI.,"of this high lore. Yet, as it is comprehended in a book, I can in part"
3645,LIB. VI.,show forth to thee how it is. (2401-2440.)
3646,LIB. VI.,
3647,LIB. VI.,
3648,LIB. VII.,LIB. VII.
3649,LIB. VII.,
3650,LIB. VII.,"1-60. Thou hast prayed me to declare to thee the school of Aristotle,"
3651,LIB. VII.,and how Alexander was taught. This is not the matter on which we were
3652,LIB. VII.,"set to speak; yet since wisdom is to be desired above all things, I"
3653,LIB. VII.,will tell thee of that which Calistre and Aristotle wrote to Alexander.
3654,LIB. VII.,
3655,LIB. VII.,"There are three principal points of Philosophy: Theoric, Rhetoric,"
3656,LIB. VII.,Practic.
3657,LIB. VII.,
3658,LIB. VII.,"61-1506. THEORIC. The parts of Theoric are three: Theology, Physics and"
3659,LIB. VII.,Mathematics. The first treats of God and things spiritual; the second
3660,LIB. VII.,"of bodily things, such as man, beast, herb and stone; and the third has"
3661,LIB. VII.,"four divisions, Arithmetic, Music, Geometry and Astronomy. (61-202.)"
3662,LIB. VII.,
3663,LIB. VII.,Aristotle taught this young king of the four elements and the four
3664,LIB. VII.,"complexions of man, of the principal divisions of the earth, and of the"
3665,LIB. VII.,"fifth element, Orbis, which contains the whole. (203-632.)"
3666,LIB. VII.,
3667,LIB. VII.,"To speak next of _Astronomy_, this Orbis is that which we call the"
3668,LIB. VII.,"firmament, and in it are first the seven Planets, and then the twelve"
3669,LIB. VII.,"Signs of the Zodiac, about each of which Alexander was taught in turn."
3670,LIB. VII.,(633-1280.)
3671,LIB. VII.,
3672,LIB. VII.,"Nectanabus, teaching him natural magic, informed him of the Fifteen"
3673,LIB. VII.,"Stars and of the stone and herb appropriate to each, by means of which"
3674,LIB. VII.,wonders may be worked. (1281-1438.)
3675,LIB. VII.,
3676,LIB. VII.,"The authors who taught this science of Astronomy were first Noë, then"
3677,LIB. VII.,"Nembrot, and after them many others, but principally Tholomee, who"
3678,LIB. VII.,"wrote the book of Almagest, and Hermes. (1439-1492.)"
3679,LIB. VII.,
3680,LIB. VII.,Thus these Philosophers taught Alexander in regard to that which is
3681,LIB. VII.,called Theoric. (1493-1506.)
3682,LIB. VII.,
3683,LIB. VII.,1507-1640. RHETORIC. Speech is given to man alone and he must take
3684,LIB. VII.,heed that he turn it to no evil use. There is virtue in stones and
3685,LIB. VII.,"in herbs, but word has virtue more than any earthly thing. But the"
3686,LIB. VII.,"word must not be discordant with the thought, as when Uluxes by his"
3687,LIB. VII.,eloquence persuaded Anthenor to betray to him the city of Troy. Words
3688,LIB. VII.,"are both evil and good, they make friend of foe and foe of friend."
3689,LIB. VII.,For a true example of Rhetoric read how Julius and the consul Cithero
3690,LIB. VII.,pleaded against one another when the treason of Catiline was discovered.
3691,LIB. VII.,
3692,LIB. VII.,"1641-5397. PRACTIC. This has three divisions, Ethics, Economics and"
3693,LIB. VII.,Politics. A king must learn the first in order that he may rule himself
3694,LIB. VII.,"in the way of good living, the second teaches him how to order his"
3695,LIB. VII.,"household, and the third how to govern his kingdom. (1641-1710.)"
3696,LIB. VII.,
3697,LIB. VII.,"1711-1984. The first point of Policy is TRUTH, which above all things"
3698,LIB. VII.,ought to be found in a king; and this is in part signified by the
3699,LIB. VII.,jewels of his crown.
3700,LIB. VII.,
3701,LIB. VII.,"To show thee that Truth is the sovereign virtue of all, I will tell"
3702,LIB. VII.,thee a tale. (1711-1782.)
3703,LIB. VII.,
3704,LIB. VII.,"_King, Wine, Woman and Truth._ Daires, Soldan of Perce, had three wise"
3705,LIB. VII.,"men about his chamber, Arpaghes, Manachaz and Zorobabel. To them he"
3706,LIB. VII.,"put the question, which is strongest, wine, woman, or a king. Of this"
3707,LIB. VII.,"they disputed in turn, and Arpaghes said, ‘A king is the strongest,"
3708,LIB. VII.,for he has power over men and can raise them up and cast them down:
3709,LIB. VII.,"also he alone stands free from the law.’ Manachaz said, ‘Wine is the"
3710,LIB. VII.,"strongest, for this takes reason away from the wise and makes the fool"
3711,LIB. VII.,"seem learned, this turns cowardice to courage and avarice to largess.’"
3712,LIB. VII.,"Zorobabel said, ‘Women are the strongest, for the king and all other"
3713,LIB. VII.,"men come of women and bow to the love of women,’ and he told how he had"
3714,LIB. VII.,"seen Cirus upon his throne overcome by the love of Apemen, daughter"
3715,LIB. VII.,"of Besazis, so that she did with him what she would. Women too make"
3716,LIB. VII.,"men desire honour, and woman is next to God the greatest help of man,"
3717,LIB. VII.,"as _Alceste_, wife of Ametus, gave her life to save her husband. Thus"
3718,LIB. VII.,"Zorobabel told his opinion, but nevertheless he said that above all"
3719,LIB. VII.,these the mightiest of all earthly things is Truth: and so the question
3720,LIB. VII.,"was concluded, and Zorobabel was most commended for his judgement."
3721,LIB. VII.,(1783-1984.)
3722,LIB. VII.,
3723,LIB. VII.,1985-2694. LARGESS is the second point of Policy. A king must be
3724,LIB. VII.,free from the vices both of Avarice and of Prodigality. As Aristotle
3725,LIB. VII.,"taught by the ill example of the king of Chaldee, he must spend his"
3726,LIB. VII.,"own substance and not that of his people, he must do justice before he"
3727,LIB. VII.,"makes gifts, and his gifts must be to those who have deserved them."
3728,LIB. VII.,(1985-2060.)
3729,LIB. VII.,
3730,LIB. VII.,_Julius and the poor Knight._ A knight came to plead his cause at
3731,LIB. VII.,"Rome, where the Emperor Julius was in presence; but he could get no"
3732,LIB. VII.,"advocate, because he was poor. He prayed for justice to the Emperor,"
3733,LIB. VII.,"and Julius assigned him an advocate. The knight was angry, and said,"
3734,LIB. VII.,"‘When I was with thee in Afric, I fought myself and put no man in my"
3735,LIB. VII.,stead: and so thou here shouldest speak for me thyself.’ Julius took
3736,LIB. VII.,his cause in hand; and thus every worthy king should help his servants
3737,LIB. VII.,when in need. (2061-2114.)
3738,LIB. VII.,
3739,LIB. VII.,_Antigonus and Cinichus._ A king should know how much to give. A poor
3740,LIB. VII.,"knight asked King Antigonus for a great sum, and he replied, ‘That is"
3741,LIB. VII.,too much for thee to ask’: then when the knight asked a very small
3742,LIB. VII.,"gift, he said, ‘That is too little for me to give.’"
3743,LIB. VII.,
3744,LIB. VII.,"Kings must not exceed the due measure in giving, and especially they"
3745,LIB. VII.,"ought not to give to flatterers, who offend against God, against the"
3746,LIB. VII.,prince and against the people. Yet flattery is always found in the
3747,LIB. VII.,courts of kings. (2115-2216.)
3748,LIB. VII.,
3749,LIB. VII.,_Diogenes and Aristippus._ Two Philosophers went from Carthage to
3750,LIB. VII.,"Athens to learn, and thence returned again. The one, Diogenes, was"
3751,LIB. VII.,"content to dwell apart and study, the other, Arisippus, went to court"
3752,LIB. VII.,and got honour and wealth by flattery. Diogenes was gathering herbs in
3753,LIB. VII.,"his garden and washing them in the river, when Arisippus passed by with"
3754,LIB. VII.,"a company, and said, ‘If thou hadst known how to make thyself pleasing"
3755,LIB. VII.,"to thy prince, there would have been no need for thee to pick herbs.’"
3756,LIB. VII.,"The other replied, ‘If thou hadst known how to pick herbs, there would"
3757,LIB. VII.,have been no need for thee to make thyself pleasing by thy flatteries.’
3758,LIB. VII.,(2217-2317.)
3759,LIB. VII.,
3760,LIB. VII.,"But the example of Arisippus is chiefly followed, and flattery is that"
3761,LIB. VII.,"which makes men beloved. [Dante the poet said once to a flatterer,"
3762,LIB. VII.,"‘Thou hast many more servants than I, for a poet cannot find how to"
3763,LIB. VII.,"feed and clothe himself, but a flatterer may rule and lead a king"
3764,LIB. VII.,"and all his land.’] There was a custom among the Romans, which was"
3765,LIB. VII.,"established against flattery, as follows. (2318-2354.)"
3766,LIB. VII.,
3767,LIB. VII.,"_Roman Triumph._ When an Emperor had a triumph after victory, he went"
3768,LIB. VII.,in pomp with four white horses and the nobles of the land before and
3769,LIB. VII.,"behind him: but one sat with him in his car, who said continually,"
3770,LIB. VII.,"‘Know thyself, and remember that good fortune is only for a time.’"
3771,LIB. VII.,Moreover he and every other man might speak whatever truth he knew to
3772,LIB. VII.,"the Emperor, whether good or bad. (2355-2411.)"
3773,LIB. VII.,
3774,LIB. VII.,"_The Emperor and his Masons._ Again, when an Emperor was enthroned, his"
3775,LIB. VII.,masons came to ask him how he would have the stone made for his tomb.
3776,LIB. VII.,"There was no flattery then, to deceive princes. (2412-2448.)"
3777,LIB. VII.,
3778,LIB. VII.,"_Caesar’s Answer._ One came and did reverence to Cesar, as if he were a"
3779,LIB. VII.,god: then he came and sat down by his side as an equal. ‘If thou art a
3780,LIB. VII.,"god,’ he said, ‘I have done well in worshipping thee, but if a man, in"
3781,LIB. VII.,"sitting by thy side.’ Cesar answered that he was a fool, and had done"
3782,LIB. VII.,"ill in one of two things, either in sitting by the side of his god or"
3783,LIB. VII.,in worshipping a mere man. They that heard this took it as a lesson
3784,LIB. VII.,against flattery. (2449-2490.)
3785,LIB. VII.,
3786,LIB. VII.,The king who bestows his goods upon flatterers does harm to himself
3787,LIB. VII.,and his land. There is an example in the Bible. (2491-2526.)
3788,LIB. VII.,
3789,LIB. VII.,_Ahab and Micaiah._ 1 Kings xxii. (2527-2694.)
3790,LIB. VII.,
3791,LIB. VII.,2695-3102. JUSTICE is the third point of Policy. A land is nothing
3792,LIB. VII.,"without men, and men cannot be without law. It is for the king above"
3793,LIB. VII.,"all others to guide the law, and though he is above the law, yet he"
3794,LIB. VII.,must not do things which are against it. He must make his own life
3795,LIB. VII.,"right towards God, and then endeavour to rule his people rightly, and"
3796,LIB. VII.,he must see that his judges are both wise and true. (2695-2764.)
3797,LIB. VII.,
3798,LIB. VII.,"_Maximin_, when he appointed a judge, inquired carefully whether"
3799,LIB. VII.,he were virtuous or no. Thus the course of law was not hindered by
3800,LIB. VII.,coveitise. (2765-2782.)
3801,LIB. VII.,
3802,LIB. VII.,"_Gaius Fabricius_, consul of Rome, when the Samnites brought him gold,"
3803,LIB. VII.,"tried it with taste and smell, and said he knew not for what it would"
3804,LIB. VII.,"serve. It was better, he said, to rule the men who had the gold, than"
3805,LIB. VII.,to possess gold and lose the liberty to be just. (2783-2817.)
3806,LIB. VII.,
3807,LIB. VII.,In those times none was preferred to the office of judge unless he were
3808,LIB. VII.,a friend to the common right. (2818-2832.)
3809,LIB. VII.,
3810,LIB. VII.,_Conrad_ ordered matters so that in his time no man durst set aside the
3811,LIB. VII.,law for gold. (2833-2844.)
3812,LIB. VII.,
3813,LIB. VII.,_Carmidotoire_ the consul slew himself rather than allow his own law to
3814,LIB. VII.,"be broken, when by inadvertence he had come armed to the Senate-house."
3815,LIB. VII.,(2845-2888.)
3816,LIB. VII.,
3817,LIB. VII.,"_Cambyses_ flayed a corrupt judge, and nailed his skin upon the chair"
3818,LIB. VII.,where his son was set to judge in his place. (2889-2904.)
3819,LIB. VII.,

3831,LIB. VII.,which the King of kings was moved when he sent his Son down to this
3832,LIB. VII.,"earth. Every subject should fear his king, and every king should have"
3833,LIB. VII.,mercy on his people. [The apostle James says that he who shows no pity
3834,LIB. VII.,shall find none. Cassodre says that the kingdom is safe where pity
3835,LIB. VII.,dwells. Tullius that the king who is overcome by pity bears a shield
3836,LIB. VII.,of victory. We read how a knight appealed from the wrath of Alexander
3837,LIB. VII.,"to his pity and so obtained grace. (3149*-3179*.)] Constantine said,"

3845,LIB. VII.,"as I would they should do to me.’ The other, ‘I am a Jew, and by my"
3846,LIB. VII.,"faith I ought to be true to no man, except he be a Jew, as I am.’ The"
3847,LIB. VII.,"day was hot and the Pagan rode on an ass with his baggage, while the"
3848,LIB. VII.,Jew went on foot. The Jew asked the Pagan to let him ease his weariness
3849,LIB. VII.,"by riding, and the other assented. So they went on, but when the Pagan"
3850,LIB. VII.,"desired his ass back, the Jew rode on, saying that thus he did his duty"
3851,LIB. VII.,"by his law. The Pagan prayed to God to judge his quarrel, and going on"
3852,LIB. VII.,further he found the Jew slain by a lion and the ass with the baggage
3853,LIB. VII.,"standing by him. Thus a man may know how the pitiful man deserves pity,"

4143,LIB. VIII.,there in the temple of Diane he found the wife whom he supposed to have
4144,LIB. VIII.,been dead. Thence they voyaged to Tyre and were received with joy.
4145,LIB. VIII.,"Athenagoras and Thaise were there crowned king and queen, and Apollinus"
4146,LIB. VIII.,sailed away and took due vengeance upon Strangulio and Dionise.
4147,LIB. VIII.,(1777-1962.)
4148,LIB. VIII.,
4149,LIB. VIII.,"When this was done, a letter came to him from Pentapolim, praying him"
4150,LIB. VIII.,"to come and receive that kingdom, since the king was dead. They had a"
4151,LIB. VIII.,"good voyage thither, and he and his wife were crowned there and led"
4152,LIB. VIII.,their life happily. (1963-2008.)
4153,LIB. VIII.,
4154,LIB. VIII.,"Thus, my son, thou mayest see how it is with those that love in a good"
4155,LIB. VIII.,"manner, but it is not love when men take their lust like beasts."
4156,LIB. VIII.,
4157,LIB. VIII.,"2029-3172. CONCLUSION. Father, I may acquit myself in this, but I"
4158,LIB. VIII.,entreat your counsel as to what way I shall follow in my love.
4159,LIB. VIII.,
4160,LIB. VIII.,"I counsel thee, my son, to labour no more in things which bring thee no"
4161,LIB. VIII.,"profit. The end of every pleasure is pain. Love is blind, and makes all"
4162,LIB. VIII.,his servants blind: thou mayest yet withdraw and set thyself under the
4163,LIB. VIII.,law of reason.
4164,LIB. VIII.,
4165,LIB. VIII.,"It is easy to say so, father. My woe is but a game to you, feeling"
4166,LIB. VIII.,nothing of that which I feel. The hart that goes free knows not the
4167,LIB. VIII.,sorrows of the ox under the yoke. But I entreat you to present for me
4168,LIB. VIII.,"a Supplication to Venus and Cupid, and bring me a good answer back."
4169,LIB. VIII.,(2009-2188.)
4170,LIB. VIII.,
4171,LIB. VIII.,Then arose a great debate between my Priest and me: my reason
4172,LIB. VIII.,"understood him well, but my will was against him. At length he agreed"
4173,LIB. VIII.,"to deliver my Supplication, and with tears instead of ink I wrote the"
4174,LIB. VIII.,"letter thus: ‘The wofull peine of loves maladie,’ &c. (2189-2300.)"
4175,LIB. VIII.,
4176,LIB. VIII.,"The Priest went forth to present my petition, and I abode. Suddenly"
4177,LIB. VIII.,"Venus stood by me, and I fell upon my knee and prayed her to do me"
4178,LIB. VIII.,"grace. ‘What is thy name?’ she said, as if in game. ‘John Gower,’"
4179,LIB. VIII.,"I replied. ‘I have read thy bill,’ she said, ‘in which thou hast"
4180,LIB. VIII.,"complained to Nature and to me. Nature is mistress where she will, and"
4181,LIB. VIII.,"I excuse thee for following her law: but as for what thou sayest, that"
4182,LIB. VIII.,"I am bound to relieve thee, because thou hast served in my Court, I"
4183,LIB. VIII.,"will give thee medicine that will heal thy heart, but perchance it will"
4184,LIB. VIII.,not be such as thou desirest.’ (2301-2376.)
4185,LIB. VIII.,
4186,LIB. VIII.,"Half in scorn she spoke to me of my age and hoary locks, and counselled"
4187,LIB. VIII.,"me to make a ‘beau retret,’ while there was yet time; for even though I"
4188,LIB. VIII.,"should attain to my desire, I could not hold covenant duly with love."
4189,LIB. VIII.,
4190,LIB. VIII.,"I grew cold suddenly for sorrow of my heart, and lay swooning on the"
4191,LIB. VIII.,"ground. Then methought I saw Cupid with his bow bent, and with him"
4192,LIB. VIII.,"a great company, those gentle folk who once were lovers, arrayed in"
4193,LIB. VIII.,sundry bands. (2377-2459.)
4194,LIB. VIII.,
4195,LIB. VIII.,"Youth was the leader of one company, and these had garlands, some of"
4196,LIB. VIII.,the leaf and some of the flower. They went with piping and with song
4197,LIB. VIII.,"which resounded all about: they laughed and danced and played, and"
4198,LIB. VIII.,talked of knighthood and of ladies’ love. There was Tristram with
4199,LIB. VIII.,"Ysolde, Lancelot with Gunnore, Jason with Creusa, Hercules with Eole,"
4200,LIB. VIII.,"Troilus with Criseide, but in his mirth he was yet heavy of cheer"
4201,LIB. VIII.,"because of Diomede. Those also I saw who died for love, as Narcissus,"
4202,LIB. VIII.,"Piramus, Achilles; and the women who were forsaken, Dido, Phillis,"
4203,LIB. VIII.,"Adriagne, Deianire and Medea. Many others too I saw, but four women"
4204,LIB. VIII.,"especially who were most commended as examples in marriage, Penolope,"
4205,LIB. VIII.,"Lucrece, Alceste and Alcione. Youth, which led this company, took no"
4206,LIB. VIII.,heed of me. (2460-2665.)
4207,LIB. VIII.,
4208,LIB. VIII.,"Then came Eld, leading a company not so great. Their music was low and"
4209,LIB. VIII.,"their dancing soft: they smiled, but they did not laugh aloud. There"
4210,LIB. VIII.,"was David with Bersabee, and Salomon with his wives and concubines,"
4211,LIB. VIII.,"Sampson with Dalida, and Aristotle with the queen of Greece; Virgil"
4212,LIB. VIII.,also and Plato and Ovid the poet. (2665-2725.)
4213,LIB. VIII.,
4214,LIB. VIII.,"When this company was come to the place where I lay, they entreated"
4215,LIB. VIII.,"Venus for me, and even some of the younger band said that it was great"
4216,LIB. VIII.,"pity. Cupid came with Venus to me as I lay, and the lovers all pressed"
4217,LIB. VIII.,"round to see. Some said that love was folly in the old, and others that"
4218,LIB. VIII.,"no age could be free, and that while there was yet oil in the lamp, it"
4219,LIB. VIII.,"might always be set alight. Cupid groped after me till he found me, and"
4220,LIB. VIII.,then he drew forth that fiery lance which before he had cast through
4221,LIB. VIII.,"my heart, and Venus anointed my wound with a cooling ointment and gave"
4222,LIB. VIII.,me a mirror in which I might behold myself. I saw my face wrinkled and
4223,LIB. VIII.,"my eyes dim, and I likened myself to that time of year when winter has"
4224,LIB. VIII.,despoiled the earth. Then Reason returned to me and I was made sober
4225,LIB. VIII.,and sound. (2726-2869.)
4226,LIB. VIII.,
4227,LIB. VIII.,"Venus beheld me, and laughing asked me what Love was. I answered with"
4228,LIB. VIII.,"confusion that I knew him not, and prayed that I might be excused from"
4229,LIB. VIII.,"my attendance on her Court. As touching my Confession too, I asked an"
4230,LIB. VIII.,"absolution, and the Priest gave it readily. Then the queen delivered"
4231,LIB. VIII.,"to me a pair of beads to hang about my neck, and on them was written"
4232,LIB. VIII.,"_Por reposer_ in gold. ‘Thus,’ said she, ‘have I provided for thine"
4233,LIB. VIII.,"ease, and my will is that thou pray for peace. Stay no more in my"
4234,LIB. VIII.,"Court, but go where moral virtue dwells, where are those books which"
4235,LIB. VIII.,men say that thou hast written: thou and I must commune together never
4236,LIB. VIII.,"again. [O]Adieu, for I must go from thee.’ And so enveloped in a starry"
4237,LIB. VIII.,"cloud, Venus was taken to her place above, and her Priest departed"
4238,LIB. VIII.,"also at the same time. I stood for a while amazed; and then I smiled,"
4239,LIB. VIII.,thinking of the beads that she had given me and of the prayers that I
4240,LIB. VIII.,should say. And thus I took my way softly homeward. (2870-2970.)
4241,LIB. VIII.,
4242,LIB. VIII.,"To God, the Creator of all things, I pray for the welfare of this"
4243,LIB. VIII.,"land, and that it may have peace and unity, which every estate should"
4244,LIB. VIII.,"desire. I pray that the clergy may work after the rule of charity, that"
4245,LIB. VIII.,the order of knighthood may cause extortion to cease and defend the
4246,LIB. VIII.,"right of the Church, that merchants may follow honesty, and above all"
4247,LIB. VIII.,that the king may keep himself and all the other estates of the kingdom
4248,LIB. VIII.,in the right way. The king who humbly follows the law of God shall be
4249,LIB. VIII.,"blessed, and his name shall be remembered for ever. (2971-3105.)"
4250,LIB. VIII.,
4251,LIB. VIII.,"I promised to make in English a book between play and earnest, and now"
4252,LIB. VIII.,I ask that I may be excused for lack of curious skill. I have written
4253,LIB. VIII.,"in rude plain words, as sickness and age would suffer me; and I pray my"
4254,LIB. VIII.,"lords that I may stand in their grace, for I desire to do pleasure to"
4255,LIB. VIII.,those under whose rule I am. (3106-3137.)
4256,LIB. VIII.,
4257,LIB. VIII.,"And now my Muse bids me rest and write no more of love, which turns the"
4258,LIB. VIII.,heart away from reason. Of this love then I take my final leave. But
4259,LIB. VIII.,"that love which stands confirmed by charity, which may save the body"
4260,LIB. VIII.,"and amend the soul, such love may God send us, that in heaven our joy"
4261,LIB. VIII.,may be without end. (3138-3172.)
4262,LIB. VIII.,
4263,LIB. VIII.,
4264,LIB. VIII.,iv. ORTHOGRAPHY AND PHONOLOGY.--In the remarks upon Gower’s language
4265,LIB. VIII.,which here follow there is no systematic completeness. Attention is
4266,LIB. VIII.,"called to such points as seem to be important or interesting, reference"
4267,LIB. VIII.,"being made especially to the language of Chaucer, as dealt with in"
4268,LIB. VIII.,"B. ten Brink’s _Chaucers Sprache und Verskunst_ (second edition,"
4269,LIB. VIII.,1899). It is necessary perhaps to remark here upon a difference of
4270,LIB. VIII.,procedure which distinguishes this investigation from those which
4271,LIB. VIII.,have for their object the text of Chaucer or of other writers whose
4272,LIB. VIII.,work is handed down to us in manuscripts which do not proceed from
4273,LIB. VIII.,the author himself. In such cases we have first to ascertain what the
4274,LIB. VIII.,"author actually wrote, before we can draw any valid conclusions about"
4275,LIB. VIII.,the laws of his language. It may even be necessary to restrict the
4276,LIB. VIII.,discussion to such forms as are authenticated by rhyme; but when we are
4277,LIB. VIII.,"compelled to do this, we must remember that we are accepting a rather"
4278,LIB. VIII.,dangerous limitation. The conclusions drawn from the rhyme-words of a
4279,LIB. VIII.,Middle English author will probably not be precisely applicable to his
4280,LIB. VIII.,language in general. The sphere of our investigations will be that in
4281,LIB. VIII.,which the licentious and exceptional is most likely to be found. If he
4282,LIB. VIII.,has any tendency to borrow from other dialects than his own or to use
4283,LIB. VIII.,"irregular forms, this tendency will be most seen in his rhymes, for it"
4284,LIB. VIII.,will probably be the exigencies of rhyme which suggest the variation.
4285,LIB. VIII.,"Chaucer repeatedly uses ‘here,’ in the sense of the modern ‘her,’ to"
4286,LIB. VIII.,"rhyme with such words as ‘bere,’ ‘spere,’ but we should certainly not"
4287,LIB. VIII.,be justified in concluding that this and not ‘hire’ was the normal
4288,LIB. VIII.,form of his language. Similarly in the case of Gower by examination of
4289,LIB. VIII.,his rhymes alone we might be led to many very doubtful results. For
4290,LIB. VIII.,"example, we should gather that he almost always used the form _sinne_"
4291,LIB. VIII.,"rather than _senne_, _wile_ (verb) and not _wole_ or _wol_, _axe_ and"
4292,LIB. VIII.,"not _aske_, _sek_ (adj.) and never _sik_, _hond_ and never _hand_,"
4293,LIB. VIII.,"_couthe_ and never _coude_, _sente_ (pret.) rather than _sende_, the"
4294,LIB. VIII.,adverb ending _-ly_ in preference to _-liche_ or _-lich_. In these
4295,LIB. VIII.,"cases and in many others we might easily be misled, the forms of these"
4296,LIB. VIII.,words as used in rhyme being determined chiefly by the comparative
4297,LIB. VIII.,frequency of the various rhyme-syllables. Most of the conclusions
4298,LIB. VIII.,"above mentioned, and others like them, have in fact been arrived at"
4299,LIB. VIII.,"in a paper by K. Fahrenberg, published in the _Archiv für die neueren"
4300,LIB. VIII.,"Sprachen_, vol. 89. The author of this paper, having only Pauli’s text"
4301,LIB. VIII.,"before him, very properly confines himself to an examination of the"
4302,LIB. VIII.,"rhymes, and within these limits most of his results are sound enough;"
4303,LIB. VIII.,but it would be very unsafe to treat them as generally applicable to
4304,LIB. VIII.,the language of Gower. In our case it must be understood that the
4305,LIB. VIII.,Fairfax manuscript is regarded (for reasons which will afterwards be
4306,LIB. VIII.,stated) as a practically accurate reproduction of the author’s original
4307,LIB. VIII.,"text, and consequently the occurrence of a particular form in rhyme is"
4308,LIB. VIII.,not held necessarily to be of any special significance.
4309,LIB. VIII.,
4310,LIB. VIII.,
4311,LIB. VIII.,"ORTHOGRAPHY.--This being premised, we shall proceed to note first some"
4312,LIB. VIII.,points which call for attention in the orthography of the text.
4313,LIB. VIII.,
4314,LIB. VIII.,"In describing the British Museum MS. Harl. 3869, Pauli takes"
4315,LIB. VIII.,occasion to observe: ‘This copy is very remarkable on account of its
4316,LIB. VIII.,"orthography, which has been carried through almost rigorously according"
4317,LIB. VIII.,to simple and reasonable principles.’ This system he appears to
4318,LIB. VIII.,"attribute to the copyist of the manuscript in question, but it is in"
4319,LIB. VIII.,"fact that of the author, the text being copied very faithfully from the"
4320,LIB. VIII.,Fairfax manuscript itself. Pauli appears to have been repelled by the
4321,LIB. VIII.,outward appearance of this ‘small stout folio’ with its rather untidy
4322,LIB. VIII.,writing. He did not take the trouble to examine the Oxford copies; but
4323,LIB. VIII.,he seems to have perceived that its orthography was the same as that of
4324,LIB. VIII.,"the Stafford manuscript, and this should have enlightened him. In fact,"
4325,LIB. VIII.,"if instead of taking Berthelette as his basis, he had simply printed"
4326,LIB. VIII.,"the text of the Harleian volume, there would hardly have been need of"
4327,LIB. VIII.,another edition.
4328,LIB. VIII.,
4329,LIB. VIII.,"The orthography of the Fairfax text, first hand, confirmed as it is"
4330,LIB. VIII.,"in almost every particular by that of the Stafford manuscript, and"
4331,LIB. VIII.,"supported also by the testimony of others, more especially of MS."
4332,LIB. VIII.,"Bodley 902, may be assumed to be that of the author; and it is well"
4333,LIB. VIII.,"worthy of our attention, for he evidently regarded exactness and"
4334,LIB. VIII.,consistency in spelling as a matter of some importance.
4335,LIB. VIII.,
4336,LIB. VIII.,We may observe in the first place that it was not Gower’s practice
4337,LIB. VIII.,to mark vowel-length by doubling the vowel. Naturally there are some
4338,LIB. VIII.,"MSS. in which this is occasionally found, and in particular the third"
4339,LIB. VIII.,"hand of A gives _caas_, _paas_, _glaade_, _maade_, _saake_, _waas_,"
4340,LIB. VIII.,"_bee_, _breeþ_, _soo_, _aroos_, _moore_, _schoon_, _ooþer_, _toold_,"
4341,LIB. VIII.,"&c. with considerable frequency, while very many MSS. have _book_,"
4342,LIB. VIII.,"_look_, _took_, _oon_, _heere_, _mateere_, and some other forms of the"
4343,LIB. VIII.,same kind; but this is not in accordance with the author’s rule. In
4344,LIB. VIII.,"the Fairfax MS. the cases of doubled vowel are only occasional, except"
4345,LIB. VIII.,"in the instance of _good_, which is thus regularly distinguished from"
4346,LIB. VIII.,_god_.
4347,LIB. VIII.,
4348,LIB. VIII.,Of _oo_ there are very few cases except _good_. We have _oon_
4349,LIB. VIII.,"about three times for _on_, and _blood_, _brood_, _cooste_,"
4350,LIB. VIII.,"_do_ (= doe), _foode_, _hool_, _schoo_, _too_ (= toe), _woot_,"
4351,LIB. VIII.,"in isolated instances. The doubling of _e_ is more frequent,"
4352,LIB. VIII.,"as _beere_, _cheeke_, _cleene_, _dee_ (pl. _dees_), _degree_,"
4353,LIB. VIII.,"_eem_, _eer_, _fee_, _feede_, _feer_, _feere_, _feet_,"
4354,LIB. VIII.,"_greene_, _meene_, _meete_, _pees_, _queene_, _scheete_, _see_"
4355,LIB. VIII.,"(subst.), _seene_, _slee_, _spreede_, _thee_, _tree_, _weer_,"
4356,LIB. VIII.,"_weere_, _wreeche_, _ȝee_, _ȝeer_, and a few more. Most of the"
4357,LIB. VIII.,"above words, however, and in general all others, are written"
4358,LIB. VIII.,"usually with a single vowel, and we have quite regularly (for"
4359,LIB. VIII.,"example) _ded_, _dede_, _drem_, _ek_, _fend_, _fre_, _gret_,"
4360,LIB. VIII.,"_hed_, _her_ (= hair), _lef_, _red_, _slep_, _bok_, _bon_,"
4361,LIB. VIII.,"_brod_, _fol_, _gon_, _hot_, _lok_, _non_, _schon_, _sone_"
4362,LIB. VIII.,"(soon), _tok_, _wok_, and so on. Where there is variation of"
4363,LIB. VIII.,"spelling in this respect, it is not felt to be a matter which"
4364,LIB. VIII.,"concerns the rhyme; for we have _weer_ : _pouer_, _pees_:"
4365,LIB. VIII.,"_reles_, _sene_ : _meene_, _there_ : _feere_, _good_ : _stod_,"
4366,LIB. VIII.,"_fode_ : _goode_, _do_ : _schoo_, &c., though sometimes the"
4367,LIB. VIII.,"spelling of the rhyme-words is evidently brought into harmony,"
4368,LIB. VIII.,"as _meene_ : _Almeene_, ii. 2465 f., _beere_ : _weere_, iv. 1323"
4369,LIB. VIII.,"f., _brood_ : _good_, v. 4375 f., _goode_ : _foode_, vii. 519"
4370,LIB. VIII.,f. In a few cases however a phonetic distinction seems to be
4371,LIB. VIII.,"intended, as when we find _eet_ as preterite of _ete_, and"
4372,LIB. VIII.,_beere_ (also _bere_) pret. plur. of _beren_.
4373,LIB. VIII.,
4374,LIB. VIII.,"_Maii_ (the month) is regularly written with _ii_, but rhymes"
4375,LIB. VIII.,"with _mai_, _gay_, &c."
4376,LIB. VIII.,
4377,LIB. VIII.,"The doubling of final consonants, apparently to indicate vowel"
4378,LIB. VIII.,"shortness, is more common, as in _all_, _bladd_, _charr_, _hadd_,"
4379,LIB. VIII.,"_happ_, _madd_, _bedd_, _fedd_, _fett_, _spedd_, _bitt_, _bridd_,"
4380,LIB. VIII.,"_chidd_, _godd_, _rodd_, beside _al_, _char_, _had_, _hap_, _mad_,"
4381,LIB. VIII.,"_bed_, _fet_, &c."
4382,LIB. VIII.,
4383,LIB. VIII.,The doubling of _s_ in a final tone syllable seems to have no
4384,LIB. VIII.,"such significance, as in _Achilles_ : _press_, iv. 2161 f., but"
4385,LIB. VIII.,"_Ulixes_ : _pres_, iv. 147 f., so _natheles_ : _encress_, _pes_:"
4386,LIB. VIII.,"_encress_, in all of which the vowel must be long."
4387,LIB. VIII.,
4388,LIB. VIII.,One of the most noteworthy points of the orthography is the frequent
4389,LIB. VIII.,use of _ie_ in tonic syllables for close _ē_. This appears in French
4390,LIB. VIII.,"words such as _achieve_, _appiere_, _chief_, _chiere_, _clier_,"
4391,LIB. VIII.,"_grieve_, _matiere_, _messagier_, _pier_, &c. (also in many of these"
4392,LIB. VIII.,"cases _e_, as _chere_, _cler_, _matere_), but it is very commonly used"
4393,LIB. VIII.,also in words of English origin and seems invariably to be associated
4394,LIB. VIII.,"with the close sound of the vowel. Thus we have _hiede_, _spriede_,"
4395,LIB. VIII.,"_lief_ (but _levere_), _sieke_, _diel_, _stiel_, _whiel_, _dieme_,"
4396,LIB. VIII.,"_sieme_, _diere_, _fiere_ (= company), _hiere_ (adv.), _hiere_ (verb),"
4397,LIB. VIII.,"_liere_, _stiere_, and others, which have in most cases the alternative"
4398,LIB. VIII.,"spelling with _e_, as _hede_, _sprede_, _seke_, _del_, _stel_, _whel_,"
4399,LIB. VIII.,"_deme_, _seme_, &c., but in all of which the vowel has the close sound."
4400,LIB. VIII.,
4401,LIB. VIII.,It is impossible here to discuss the question how far this habit of
4402,LIB. VIII.,spelling may have been introduced by analogy from French words with
4403,LIB. VIII.,"a similar sound of the vowel, and how far it may have grown out the"
4404,LIB. VIII.,"Kentish use of _ie_, _ye_ for O. E. _ēo_, _ē_, _īe_. Reference may"
4405,LIB. VIII.,be made to the remarks in the Introduction to the volume of Gower’s
4406,LIB. VIII.,"French Works, p. xxi, where it is suggested that _ie_, having lost its"
4407,LIB. VIII.,"value as a diphthong in later Anglo-Norman, came to be regarded as a"
4408,LIB. VIII.,"traditional symbol in many cases for close _ē_, and hence such forms as"
4409,LIB. VIII.,"_clier_, _clief_, _pier_, _prophiete_, &c., and as regards _ie_ in the"
4410,LIB. VIII.,"Kentish dialect there is a useful statement in the paper by W. Heuser,"
4411,LIB. VIII.,"_Zum Kentischen Dialekt im Mittelenglischen_, published in _Anglia_,"
4412,LIB. VIII.,"xvii, 78 ff."
4413,LIB. VIII.,
4414,LIB. VIII.,In any case the fact is pretty clear that this variation was confined
4415,LIB. VIII.,"by Gower to words in which he gave to the vowel a close sound, and it"
4416,LIB. VIII.,"is therefore useful as a distinguishing note, though there are few"
4417,LIB. VIII.,words in which this is the only form of spelling.
4418,LIB. VIII.,
4419,LIB. VIII.,Both in stems of words and in their terminations _i_ is on the whole
4420,LIB. VIII.,"preferred to _y_, so that we have _crie_, _hide_, _lif_, _like_,"
4421,LIB. VIII.,"_mile_, _ride_, &c. more usually than _crye_, _hyde_, &c. (but perhaps"
4422,LIB. VIII.,"_y_ more often after _m_, _n_, as _knyht_, _myhte_, _nyht_), and also"
4423,LIB. VIII.,"_arrai_, _mai_, _dai_, _hardi_, _ladi_, _worþi_, _mi_, _thi_, more"
4424,LIB. VIII.,"often on the whole than _array_, _may_, &c., but _-ly_ in adverbs more"
4425,LIB. VIII.,often than _-li_.
4426,LIB. VIII.,
4427,LIB. VIII.,In some few cases it seems that a distinction is pretty consistently
4428,LIB. VIII.,"made, as between _wryte_ (inf.) and _write_ (past participle), and"
4429,LIB. VIII.,perhaps between _wite_ (know) and _wyte_ (blame).
4430,LIB. VIII.,
4431,LIB. VIII.,"Before _gh_ followed by _t_ we find _a_, _o_ almost regularly in place"
4432,LIB. VIII.,"of _au_, _ou_. Thus we have _aghte_, _straghte_, _taghte_, _boghte_,"
4433,LIB. VIII.,"_broghte_, _doghter_, _noght_, _oghte_, _oght_, _soghte_, _wroghte_,"
4434,LIB. VIII.,"&c., but occasionally _broughte_, _doughter_, _ought_, &c. Beside"
4435,LIB. VIII.,"some of these there are forms in which _au_ (_aw_), _ou_ (_ow_) are"
4436,LIB. VIII.,"written, but followed by simple _h_, as _strawhte_, _tawhte_, _douhter_"
4437,LIB. VIII.,(_dowhter_).
4438,LIB. VIII.,
4439,LIB. VIII.,There is no difference between _-oun_ and _-on_ as terminations
4440,LIB. VIII.,"of such French words as _divisioun_, _complexioun_, &c.,"
4441,LIB. VIII.,but _-oun_ is much the more usual form[P]. Where they occur
4442,LIB. VIII.,"in rhyme, the rhyme-words are usually assimilated to one"
4443,LIB. VIII.,"another in form of spelling, but sometimes _-oun_, _-on_"
4444,LIB. VIII.,"rhyme together, as _division_ : _doun_, ii. 1743 f., _toun_:"
4445,LIB. VIII.,"_condicion_, v. 2551, _constellacioun_ : _relacion_, vi. 2253 f."
4446,LIB. VIII.,
4447,LIB. VIII.,In the case of _an_ followed by a consonant in a tone-syllable
4448,LIB. VIII.,the variation to _aun_ seems to be merely a question of
4449,LIB. VIII.,"spelling, and we have such rhymes as _chaunce_ : _remembrance_,"
4450,LIB. VIII.,"ii. 893 f., _demande_ : _comaunde_, iv. 2794, _supplanted_:"
4451,LIB. VIII.,"_enchaunted_, ii. 2491, _covenant_ : _supplaunt_, ii. 2367. In"
4452,LIB. VIII.,"the French terminations _-ance_, _-ant_, the simple form is"
4453,LIB. VIII.,"decidedly preferred (but _governaunce_ : _porveaunce_, Prol. 187"
4454,LIB. VIII.,"f., _graunt_ : _amblaunt_, ii. 1505 f.), and so also in many"
4455,LIB. VIII.,"other words, as _change_, _strange_, _comande_, _demande_,"
4456,LIB. VIII.,"_supplante_ (also _comaunde_, _supplaunte_). In other cases"
4457,LIB. VIII.,"_au_ is either the usual or the only form, as _daunce_,"
4458,LIB. VIII.,"_daunte_, _enchaunte_, _haunte_, _sclaundre_."
4459,LIB. VIII.,
4460,LIB. VIII.,"With regard to the consonants, it should be observed that Gower"
4461,LIB. VIII.,"consistently wrote _sch_ for _sh_ initially, so that we have regularly"
4462,LIB. VIII.,"_schal_, _schape_, _sche_, _schewe_, _schip_, _schrifte_, and also"
4463,LIB. VIII.,"_lordschipe_, _worschipe_, &c.[Q], in other places usually _ssh_,"
4464,LIB. VIII.,"as _bisshop_ (also _bisschop_), _buissh_, _fissh_, _fleissh_ (also"
4465,LIB. VIII.,"_fleisch_), _freissh_, _reisshe_, _wisshe_."
4466,LIB. VIII.,
4467,LIB. VIII.,"The almost regular use of _h_ for _gh_ in such words as _hih_, _nyh_,"
4468,LIB. VIII.,"_sih_, _kniht_, _liht_, _miht_, _niht_, _heihte_, _sleihte_, &c. will"
4469,LIB. VIII.,be spoken of later.
4470,LIB. VIII.,
4471,LIB. VIII.,"Gower did not use _ȝ_ for _h_ or _gh_. Such forms as _miȝte_, _riȝt_,"
4472,LIB. VIII.,"_uȝte_, _wrouȝt_, are practically unknown in the best MSS. (F has"
4473,LIB. VIII.,"_nouȝt_ once.) On the other hand initially in such words as _ȝe_,"
4474,LIB. VIII.,"_ȝer_, _ȝive_ (_forȝive_), _ȝong_, &c., _ȝ_ is regularly used. Only"
4475,LIB. VIII.,late and inferior MSS. have _y_. In regard to this letter Gower’s
4476,LIB. VIII.,usage is exactly the reverse of that which we find in the _Ayenbite of
4477,LIB. VIII.,Inwyt_. We have _þ_ for _th_ regularly except in the case of a capital
4478,LIB. VIII.,"letter being required, as at the beginning of a line, or in connexion"
4479,LIB. VIII.,"with some foreign words and names as _thalemans_, _thevangile_,"
4480,LIB. VIII.,"_rethorique_, _Athemas_, _Anthenor_, _Thebith_. Cases of _th_ for _þ_"
4481,LIB. VIII.,"in ordinary English words are very rare in F (but i. 2890, v. 2319,"
4482,LIB. VIII.,vii. 4203).
4483,LIB. VIII.,
4484,LIB. VIII.,"In some words there is an interchange of _c_ and _s_, as"
4485,LIB. VIII.,"_decerte_, _pourchace pourchase_, _service servise_, _rancoun_,"
4486,LIB. VIII.,"_suffice suffise_, _sufficant_, &c., and the French termination"
4487,LIB. VIII.,"_-esse_ is also spelt _-esce_, as _largesse largesce_,"
4488,LIB. VIII.,"_simplesce simplesse_; so also _encresce_, _redresce_, &c."
4489,LIB. VIII.,In such points the orthography of Romance words is usually
4490,LIB. VIII.,in accordance with that which we find in the author’s French
4491,LIB. VIII.,"writings, in which also are found such etymological forms as"
4492,LIB. VIII.,"_deceipte_, _doubte_."
4493,LIB. VIII.,
4494,LIB. VIII.,"Before quitting the general subject, we ought to note certain words"
4495,LIB. VIII.,of common occurrence which are spelt not quite in the usual way. The
4496,LIB. VIII.,"author regularly writes _bot_ for _but_, _be_ for _by_, when used as"
4497,LIB. VIII.,"a preposition and unemphatic, _ous_ for _us_ (pers. pron.), _noght_"
4498,LIB. VIII.,"for _not_ (_not_ being used for _ne wot_). Some forms of proper names,"
4499,LIB. VIII.,"as _Habraham_, _Irahel_, are characteristic. In these points, as in"
4500,LIB. VIII.,"many others, the writer evidently followed a definite system, and in"
4501,LIB. VIII.,"spite of the variations recorded, the orthography of the Fairfax and"
4502,LIB. VIII.,Stafford MSS. certainly conveys to the reader the general impression of
4503,LIB. VIII.,regularity and consistency.

4888,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"must be set as having unstable pronunciation. Thus, in spite of the"

4912,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"The conclusions to which we are led are, first that in Gower’s usage"

4915,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,variations even in their case more exceptional; secondly that Gower’s
4916,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,language has a strongly pronounced leaning towards _ẹ̄_; and finally
4917,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,that this tendency is quite as much visible in the words of the _ǣ_ =
4918,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,_ai_ class as in the others.
4919,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,

4921,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,O. E. =ēa=. The substantive _believe_ has _ẹ̄_ by influence of the verb.
4922,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,

4941,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,is at least possible that the difference here between Gower and Chaucer
4942,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"arises from the fact that the latter was less strict in his rhymes, and"

4944,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,no confirmation of the idea that they had _ẹ̄_ regularly in Chaucer’s

5003,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,upon occasion owing to the influence of _w_. This is shown to be wrong
5004,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"both by the fact that the rhymes in question are, as we have seen, by"
5005,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"no means confined to these words, and by the absence of other evidence"
5006,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,in the case of _wo_ and _so_ that they ever had a tendency to _ọ̄_. The
5007,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,fact that the rhyme _do_ : _so_ is by far the commonest instance is due
5008,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,simply to the more frequent occasion for using the words.

5012,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,and rhyme point to a verb _love_ corresponding to the substantive _lof_

5500,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"especially F and S, makes it certain this was sometimes done by the"
5501,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"author. It is impossible to trace any system, but the number of verbs"
5502,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"affected is not large, and in nearly every case the instances of this"

5548,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_putt_ occurs in v. 7417, and in this case the verb is plural."

5553,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the loss of the final _e_ is somewhat more common, but it is usually"
5554,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"retained, and sometimes it counts as a syllable in the verse. Where"
5555,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"this is not the case, it is either elided in the usual way, or if it be"
5556,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"dropped in writing, this is only under the conditions which apply to"
5557,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the verbs mentioned above, namely, before a vowel at the beginning of"
5558,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,the succeeding word.
5559,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5560,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"It is, however, noteworthy that the use of these forms, whether in"
5561,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_-ede_ or _-ed_, is decidedly rare, and was avoided by our author even"
5562,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,in cases where the _-e_ would have been subject to elision. It is
5563,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"evident that he was always conscious of this ending, even if he did not"
5564,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"always write it, and yet he felt that the two weak syllables ought not"
5565,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,to have full value in the metre. The result was that he avoided the
5566,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"use of the form generally, so far as it was reasonably possible to do"
5567,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"so. The whole number of these preterites in _-ede_, _-ed_ to be found"
5568,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"in the _Confessio Amantis_ is surprisingly small, both actually and"
5569,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"relatively, that is, taking account of the extent to which the verbs"
5570,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,in question are employed in their other tenses. The method pursued is
5571,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"chiefly to substitute in narrative the present tense, or the perfect"
5572,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"formed with ‘hath,’ for the 3rd person singular of the preterite,"
5573,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"‘Conforteth’ for ‘Confortede,’ ‘Hath axed’ for ‘axede,’ ‘feigneth’"
5574,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"for ‘feignede,’ and this apparently as a matter of habit and even in"
5575,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,cases where a vowel follows. No doubt the use of the present tense in
5576,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"narrative is quite usual apart from this, but the extremely frequent"
5577,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,combination of strong or syncopated preterites with the present tenses
5578,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,of verbs of this class seems to me to indicate clearly how the matter

5640,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,with _-e_ elided. It will be noted that in the plural the form _-eden_
5641,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"is used regularly when the syllables are to be fully pronounced, though"
5642,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,_-ede_ can be used for the sake of elision.
5643,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5644,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"The _-ed_ form of preterite is less frequent than the other, and I am"

5652,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,observe that the _-ed_ form stands also in the plural.
5653,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5654,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,Among weak preterites from originally strong verbs we may notice
5655,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_abreide_, _crepte_ (but past participle _crope_), _foghte_, _fledde_,"
5656,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_schotte_, _slepte_ (also _slep_, with past participle _slepe_),"
5657,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_smette_ (beside _smot_), _wepte_. The pret. _satte_ in vii. 2282, ‘He"
5658,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"satte him thanne doun,’ seems to arise from confusion of _sat_ and"
5659,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,_sette_.
5660,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5661,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,=Imperative.= The _Confessio Amantis_ is peculiarly rich in

5668,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"but not in such positions as to affect the metre. The forms _axe_,"
5669,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_herkne_, _loke_, _wite_ are regular, but _lok_ also occurs (i. 1703,"
5670,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,v. 1220).
5671,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5672,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,In some instances the short form of imperative seems to be used as
5673,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"3rd pers., e.g. ‘hold clos the ston,’ v. 3573, for ‘let him hold,’"
5674,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"‘tak in his minde,’ viii. 1128, for ‘let him take,’ cp. viii. 1420."
5675,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"The singular and plural forms are often used without distinction,"

5681,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"sometimes the distinction is preserved, the Confessor saying _tak_,"
5682,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_tell_, _understond_, and the Lover _telleth_, _axeth_ (e.g. i. 1395,"
5683,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"1875), at other times the Lover says _lest_, _say_, _tell_, _lef_, &c."

5685,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5686,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,=Present Participle.= The form of the present participle is the most
5687,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,characteristic part of Gower’s verb inflexion as compared (for example)
5688,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,with Chaucer’s. Chaucer seems regularly to have used the form in
5689,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,_-inge_ (often with apocope _-ing_): Gower uses ordinarily the form
5690,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_-ende_, and normally with the accent thrown on the termination, as i."
5691,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"204, ‘To me _spekende_ thus began,’ 236, ‘Whos Prest I am _touchende_"

5696,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Sometimes the same form is used with accent on the preceding syllable,"
5697,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"and in this case the _-e_ is systematically elided, e.g. Prol. 11, ‘In"

5701,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5702,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,In a relatively small number of instances the form _-inge_ occurs

5704,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"rhyme with ‘singe,’ i. 1710, ‘And liveth, as who seith, _deyinge_,’ in"

5709,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,

5711,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,back it is always elided.
5712,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5713,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,=Past Participle.= The _-id_ termination of weak past participles is
5714,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"very rarely found in the Fairfax MS., except in the concluding passage,"
5715,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,which is copied in a different hand from the rest. It occurs commonly
5716,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"in the _Praise of Peace_. Examples found elsewhere in F are _weddid_,"
5717,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"iv. 650, _medlid_, iv. 1475."
5718,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5719,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,From _setten_ besides the regular past participle _set_ there appears
5720,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the form _sete_ twice in rhyme, vii. 2864, _forȝete_ : _sete_, and"
5721,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"viii. 244, _misgete_ (past partic.): _upsete_. This seems to be formed"
5722,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"after the analogy of _gete_. On the other hand we have _ferd_, i. 445,"
5723,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"&c., but also _fare(n)_, iii. 2692, v. 3797, &c. The past participle"
5724,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"of _se_ is _sen_, _sein_, _seie_, but most commonly _sene_. In a few"
5725,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"instances a final _e_ is given by the MSS. in weak past participles,"
5726,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"e.g. _herde_ for _herd_, v. 4231, _schope_ for _schop_, v. 4278,"
5727,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_sette_ for _set_, vi. 10, _wiste_ for _wist_, viii. 37."
5728,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5729,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,The cases of weak past participles with plural inflexion (e.g. Prol.
5730,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"300, i. 3246, iv. 2343, v. 6789) have already been mentioned in dealing"

5736,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5737,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,vi. DIALECT. Gower’s language is undoubtedly in the main the English
5738,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"of the Court, and not a provincial dialect. Making allowance for the"
5739,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,influences of literary culture and for a rather marked conservatism
5740,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"in orthography and grammatical inflexions, we can see that it agrees"
5741,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"on the whole with the London speech of the time, as evidenced by the"
5742,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,contemporary documents referred to by Prof. Morsbach. At the same time
5743,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"its tendencies are Southern rather than Midland, and he seems to have"
5744,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,used Kentish forms rather more freely than Chaucer. This is shown
5745,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,especially (1) in the more extensive use of the forms in which _e_
5746,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"stands for O. E. _y̆_, as _senne_, _kesse_, _pet_, _hell_, &c.; (2) in"

5748,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"represent _ẹ̄_, a practice which can hardly be without connexion with"
5749,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the Kentish _cliene_, _diepe_, _diere_, _hier_, _hield_, _niede_, &c.;"
5750,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,(3) in the use of _-ende_ as the normal termination of the present
5751,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,participle. (The _Ayenbite_ regularly has _-inde_.) Probably also
5752,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the preference shown by Gower for the close sound of _ē_, from O. E."
5753,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_ǣ_, may be to some extent due to Kentish influence. Other points of"
5754,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,resemblance between the language of Gower and that of the _Ayenbite_
5755,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,(for example) are the free use of syncopated forms in the 3rd pers.

5759,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"vii. METRE, &c. The smoothness and regularity of Gower’s metre has"
5760,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"been to some extent recognized. Dr. Schipper in _Englische Metrik_,"
5761,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"vol. i. p. 279, remarks upon the skill with which the writer, while"
5762,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"preserving the syllabic rule, makes his verse flow always so smoothly"
5763,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"without doing violence to the natural accentuation of the words,"
5764,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"and giving throughout the effect of an accent verse, not one which"
5765,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,is formed by counting syllables. Judging by the extracts printed in
5766,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Morris and Skeat’s _Specimens_ (which are taken from MS. Harl. 3869,"

5768,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,that the five principal licences which he has noted generally in the
5769,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,English verse of the period are almost entirely absent from Gower’s
5770,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"octosyllabics, and in particular that he neither omits the first"
5771,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"unaccented syllable, as Chaucer so often does (e.g. ‘Be it rouned, red"
5772,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"or songe,’ _Hous of Fame_, ii. 214, ‘Any lettres for to rede,’ iii. 51,"
5773,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"‘Of this hill that northward lay,’ iii. 62), nor displaces the natural"
5774,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"accent (as ‘Of Decembre the tenthe day,’ _Hous of Fame_, i. 111,"
5775,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"‘Jupiter considereth wel this,’ ii. 134, ‘Rounede everych in otheres"
5776,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"ere,’ iii. 954), nor slurs over syllables."
5777,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5778,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,To say that Gower never indulges in any of these licences would be an
5779,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,exaggeration. Some displacement of the natural accent may be found
5780,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"occasionally, even apart from the case of those French words whose"
5781,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"accent was unsettled, but it is present in a very slight degree, and"
5782,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,the rhythm produced does not at all resemble that of the lines cited
5783,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"above from Chaucer: e.g. i. 2296, ‘Wher that he wolde make his chace,’"
5784,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"2348, ‘Under the grene thei begrave,’ 2551, ‘“Drink with thi fader,"
5785,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Dame,” he seide.’ Such as it is, this licence is nearly confined to"
5786,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the first foot of the verse, and is not so much a displacement of the"
5787,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"natural accent of the words as a trochaic commencement, after the"
5788,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,fashion which has established itself as an admitted variety in the
5789,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"English iambic. We may, however, read long passages of the _Confessio"
5790,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,Amantis_ without finding any line in which the accent is displaced even
5791,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,to this extent.
5792,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5793,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Again, as to slurring of syllables, this no doubt takes place, but on"
5794,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,regular principles and with certain words or combinations only. There
5795,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,are hardly more than three or four lines in the whole of the _Confessio
5796,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,Amantis_ where a superfluous syllable stands unaccounted for in the
5797,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"body of the verse, as for example,"

5803,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5804,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,The writer seems to have no need of any licences. The narrative
5805,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"flows on in natural language, and in sentences and periods which are"
5806,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"apparently not much affected by the exigencies of metre or rhyme, and"
5807,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,yet the verse is always smooth and the rhyme never fails to be correct.
5808,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"If this is not evidence of the highest style of art, it shows at least"
5809,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,very considerable skill.

5812,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"2217-2300 and in the poem _In Praise of Peace_, Schipper finds less"
5813,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"smoothness of metre, ‘owing perhaps to the greater unfamiliarity and"
5814,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"difficulty of the stanza and verse’ (_Englische Metrik_, i. 483 ff.)."
5815,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"His examples, however, are not conclusive on this point. Some of the"

5817,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,prove to be quite regularly in accordance with Gower’s usual metrical
5818,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,principles.

5823,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,

5828,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5829,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"it is impossible, according to Gower’s usage, that ‘heven’ should stand"
5830,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"as a dissyllable. He wrote always ‘hevene,’ and the penultimate was"
5831,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"syncopated. So also ‘levere’ in l. 340, ‘evere,’ l. 376. Hence there is"
5832,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"no ‘epic caesura’ in any of these cases. Nor again in l. 164, ‘Crist"
5833,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"is the heved,’ can ‘heved’ be taken as a dissyllable in the verse: it"
5834,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,is always metrically equivalent to ‘hed.’ The only fair instance of a
5835,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"superfluous syllable at the caesura is in l. 66,"
5836,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,

5838,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5839,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,It seems that the trochee occurs more commonly here than in the short
5840,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"line. Such examples as Schipper quotes, occurring at the beginning of"

5847,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Perhaps, however, a difference is afforded by the more frequent"

5872,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"as we shall see if we examine them. (α) Gower has the forms _hire_,"
5873,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_oure_, _ȝoure_, all occasionally as dissyllables apart from special"

5884,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
5885,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,Gower’s usage with reference to this matter is as follows:

5992,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Gower’s story) gives the name as _Canacee_, in rhyme with _he_. Also"
5993,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the combinations _byme_, _tome_, _tothe_, &c., have weak _-e_ and are"

6001,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_hire_, _how_, &c. For example, elision takes place usually before"

6042,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Chaucer’s. There are, however, a number of words of French origin, of"
6043,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"which the accent was unsettled, and also some instances of English"
6044,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,words in which a secondary syllable was capable of receiving the
6045,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"principal accent, either in case of composition, as in _kingdom_,"
6046,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_knihthode_, _treweliche_, or with a formative termination, as that"
6047,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"of the superlative, _fairéste_, &c., or the present participle, as"
6048,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,_wepénde_. In such cases the accent was often determined by the metre.
6049,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Many Romance words are quite freely treated in the matter of accent,"
6050,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"as for example _folie_, _fortune_, _mercy_, _mirour_, _nature_,"

6053,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_-schipe_ are all capable of accent, and also the penultimate syllables"
6054,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,of _answere_ and _felawe_.
6055,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6056,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,Nearly all that is important about rhyme has already been said under
6057,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,the head of Phonology. We may here remark on some of the instances
6058,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"in which the form of words is accommodated to the rhyme, these"
6059,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,being sometimes cases where variants are supplied by neighbouring
6060,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"dialects. Thus we have _aise_ for _ese_, _ar_ for _er_, _hair_ for"
6061,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_heir_, _naght_ once for _noght_, _fer_ once for _fyr_, _hade_,"
6062,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"with the original long vowel, for _hadde_, _geth_ (the originally"
6063,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"correct form) for _goth_, _fore_ for _for_; and alternatives such as"
6064,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_moneie monoie_, _aweie awey away_, _seide saide_, _soverein"
6065,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"soverain_, are used in accordance with the rhyme, though it is"
6066,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,difficult to say for certain in all cases whether there was difference
6067,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"of sound. Thus, while we have _away_ as rhyme to _day_, _awey_ is found"
6068,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"rhyming to _ey_, i. 2545, _said_, _saide_ rhyming with _paid_, _Maide_,"
6069,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"while _seide_ rhymes with _alleide_, _obeide_; we find _soverein_ :"
6070,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_aȝein_, but _brayn_ : _soverain_. The form _yhe_ often varies to"
6071,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"_ÿe_ when in rhyme with _-ie_ termination, as _clergie_ : _ÿe_, Prol."
6072,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"329 f., _ÿe_ : _agonie_, i. 967 f. (but also _yhe_ : _pourpartie_, i."
6073,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"405 f., _yhe_ : _specefie_, i. 571 f.). Sometimes however the other"
6074,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"rhyme-word is modified to correspond to it, as _pryhe_ : _yhe_, v. 469"
6075,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"f., and there was probably no perceptible difference of pronunciation"
6076,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,in this case. So also the preterite _lowh_ is written _low_ when in
6077,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"rhyme with _now_, Prol. 1071, and similarly _thou_ : _ynou_, vii."
6078,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"2099 f. (but _bowe_ : _ynowhe_, ii. 3225 f.). We have already seen"
6079,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"that the use of such alternative forms as _sinne senne_, _wile"
6080,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"wole_, _lasse lesse_, _hedde hidde_, _-ende -inge_ is sometimes"
6081,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,determined by the rhyme.

6113,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"or in the hands of booksellers, and probably there may be a few more in"
6114,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"private possession, the existence of which has not yet been recorded."
6115,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,As the broad lines for their classification are necessarily laid down
6116,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,by the fact that the book was put forth by the author in several
6117,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"different forms, it is necessary, before proceeding further, to say"
6118,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,something about this matter.
6119,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6120,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"That the poem exists in at least two distinct forms, characterized"
6121,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"by obvious differences near the beginning and at the end, has been"
6122,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,matter of common knowledge. Even in Berthelette’s edition of 1532 the
6123,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"difference at the beginning was noted, and though the printer did not"
6124,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,venture to deviate from the form of text which had been made current
6125,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"by Caxton, yet he gave in his preface the beginning of the poem as he"
6126,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,found it in his manuscript. Dr. Pauli accordingly proceeded on the
6127,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"assumption that there were two normal forms, one having a dedication"
6128,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,to Richard II at the beginning and a form of conclusion in which
6129,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"mention is made of Chaucer, and the other with a dedication to Henry of"
6130,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,Lancaster and a conclusion in which Chaucer is not mentioned. Copies
6131,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,which do not conform to these standards are for him simply irregular.
6132,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,He is aware of the additional passages in Berthelette’s edition and
6133,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"in the Stafford MS., and in one place he speaks of three classes of"
6134,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"MSS., but he does not know that there are any written copies except"
6135,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,the Stafford MS. which contain the additional passages. If he had had
6136,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"personal knowledge of the manuscripts at Oxford and at Cambridge,"
6137,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,instead of being satisfied to gather scraps of information about the
6138,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"former from Bodley’s Librarian and about the latter from Todd, he would"
6139,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,have found the passages in question also in MS. Bodley 294 at Oxford
6140,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,and in the Trinity and Sidney MSS. at Cambridge.
6141,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6142,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,There are then at least these three classes of manuscripts to be
6143,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"recognized even by a superficial observer, and we shall find that the"
6144,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,more obvious differences which have been mentioned are accompanied by
6145,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,a number of others of less importance. The first recension according
6146,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,to our classification is that in which the conclusion of the poem
6147,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,contains praises of Richard II as a just and beneficent ruler and
6148,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,a presentation of the book for his acceptance[AB]. The second has

6151,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,while the conclusion of the poem has been rewritten so as to exclude
6152,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the praises of the king, and in some copies there is also a new preface"
6153,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,with dedication to Henry of Lancaster. The third exhibits a return
6154,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"to the form of the first as regards the additional passages, but has"
6155,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,the rewritten preface and epilogue. Against this merely threefold
6156,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,division some objections might fairly be made. It might be pointed out
6157,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,that the so-called second recension includes at least two distinct
6158,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"forms, and moreover that upon further examination we see reason to"
6159,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"divide the manuscripts of our first recension into two main groups,"
6160,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"one exhibiting an earlier and the other a later text, this last being"
6161,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,more in accordance generally with that of what we call the second and
6162,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,third recensions than with the earlier form of the first. For practical
6163,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"purposes, however, the division which has been laid down above may"
6164,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"fairly be adopted. As regards the order of time, from the political"
6165,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,tendency of the differences between them it is clear that what we call
6166,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,the first recension logically precedes the third. The intermediate
6167,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,position of the second is given chiefly by the fact that one of the
6168,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"seven existing manuscripts gives the earlier form of preface, and this"
6169,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"may also have been the case with two others, which are defective at"
6170,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the beginning[AC]. However, as has been said, the name is used for"
6171,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"convenience to cover a class of copies which, as regards the character"
6172,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"of their text, do not all belong to the same period, and they must"
6173,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,be looked upon as representing rather a concurrent variety of the
6174,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,first or the third recension[AD] than as a type which is distinctly
6175,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,intermediate in order of time. At the same time the smaller variations
6176,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"of text exhibited by these seven MSS. in combination, as against all"
6177,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"others[AE], mark them as really a family apart, more closely related to"
6178,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,one another than to those that lie outside the group.
6179,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6180,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,For the sake of clearness the manuscripts are in this edition
6181,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"regularly grouped according to this classification, and in the critical"
6182,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,notes each class is cited by itself. At the same time it must not be
6183,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,assumed that the manuscripts of each recension stand necessarily by
6184,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"themselves, and that no connexion is traceable between one class and"
6185,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"another. On the contrary, we shall find that many errors in the text"
6186,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"of the first recension appear also in some copies of the second, and"
6187,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,even of the third. The process by which this was brought about is made
6188,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,clearer to us by the fact that we have an example of a manuscript which
6189,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,has passed from one group into another partly by erasure and partly
6190,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"by substitution of leaves, apparently made under the direction of the"
6191,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"author. This is MS. Fairfax 3, which forms the basis of our text, and"
6192,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,the handwriting of some of the substituted pages is one which may be
6193,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,recognized as belonging to the ‘scriptorium’ of the poet.
6194,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6195,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,The example is a suggestive one and serves to explain several things.
6196,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"It makes it easy to understand, for example, how the additional matter"
6197,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,introduced into the second recension came to be omitted in the third.
6198,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,The author in this instance had before him a very fully revised and
6199,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"corrected copy of his first edition, and this by a certain amount of"
6200,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,rewriting over erasure and by a substitution of leaves at the beginning
6201,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,and end of the poem was converted into a copy of what we call the third
6202,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"recension, which his scribes could use at once as an authoritative"
6203,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,exemplar. The introduction of the additional passages in the fifth
6204,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,and seventh books could not have been effected without a process of
6205,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"recopying the whole book, which would have called for much additional"
6206,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"labour of the nature of proof-reading on the part of the author, in"
6207,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,order to secure its correctness. This argument would apply to a book
6208,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"which was intended to remain in the hands of the author, or rather of"
6209,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the scribes whom he employed, and to be used as an archetype from which"
6210,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,copies were to be made. If a new book had to be specially prepared for
6211,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"presentation, the case would be different, and it might then be worth"
6212,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,while to incorporate the additional passages with the fully revised and
6213,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"re-dedicated text, as we find was done in the case of the so-called"
6214,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,Stafford MS.
6215,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6216,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,Another matter which can evidently be explained in the same way is the
6217,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,reappearance in some copies of the second recension of errors which
6218,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,belong to the first. In producing the originals of such manuscripts as
6219,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"these, partially revised copies of the first recension must have been"
6220,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"used as the basis, and such errors as had not yet received correction"
6221,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,appear in the new edition.
6222,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6223,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"The assumption that a certain number of errors are original, that"
6224,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"is to say, go back either to the author’s own autograph or to the"
6225,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"transcript first made from it, is in itself probable: we know in fact"
6226,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"that some which appear in every copy, without exception, of the first"
6227,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,and second recensions at length receive correction by erasure in
6228,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Fairfax 3. So far as we can judge, the text of the _Confessio Amantis_"
6229,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,during its first years exhibited a steady tendency to rid itself of
6230,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"error, and the process of corruption in the ordinary sense can hardly"
6231,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,be said to have set in until after the death of the author. There are
6232,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,a large number of various readings in the case of which we find on the
6233,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"one side the great majority of first recension MSS., and on the other a"
6234,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,small number of this same type together with practically the whole of
6235,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the second and third recensions, as, for example[AF]:"

6270,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6271,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"We see in these examples, selected as fairly typical, that some of"
6272,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the variants have evidently the character of errors, while in other"
6273,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,cases the difference of reading is due to an alternative version. The
6274,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"circumstances, however, of these two cases are not distinguishable, the"
6275,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"errors are supported by as much authority as the rest, and it must be"
6276,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,supposed that both have the same origin. If then we assume that such
6277,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"variations as we find (for example) in i. 3396, 3416, v. 30, 47, 82,"
6278,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"368, 2694, &c., are due to the author, as is almost certain, there can"
6279,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,be no doubt that the form of text which is given by the group AJM in
6280,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,combination with the second and third recensions is the later of the
6281,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,two: and if the group H₁ ... B₂ represents an earlier type as regards
6282,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"this class of variation, it must surely do so also as regards the"
6283,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"errors, which, as we have seen, stand upon the same ground in respect"
6284,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,of manuscript authority. As we cannot help believing that the author
6285,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"wrote originally ‘To holde hir whil my lif may laste,’ v. 82, and"
6286,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"‘The more he hath the more he greedeth,’ v. 394, so we may reasonably"
6287,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"suppose that errors such as ‘it’ for ‘hid,’ i. 1755, ‘that diere’ for"
6288,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"‘that other,’ ii. 833, ‘what’ for ‘war,’ iii. 1065, existed in the copy"
6289,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,which first served as an exemplar.
6290,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6291,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,It may be observed here that in cases where revision seems to have
6292,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"taken place, we can frequently see a definite reason for the change;"
6293,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"either the metre is made more smooth, as i. 1770, 2622, 3374, ii. 671,"
6294,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"751, 1763, iii. 765, 2042, 2556, iv. 234, v. 368, 1678, &c., or some"
6295,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"name is altered into a more correct form, as where ‘Element’ is changed"
6296,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"to ‘Clemenee,’ iv. 985, with a corresponding alteration of the rhyme,"
6297,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"or the expression and run of the sentence is improved, as i. 368, 3416,"
6298,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"v. 30, 1906, 6756, &c. In particular we note the tendency towards"
6299,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,increased smoothness of metre which is shown in dealing with weak _e_
6300,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,terminations.
6301,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6302,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,It is to be assumed on the principles which have been stated that the
6303,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,group ERCLB₂ and the other manuscripts which agree with them represent
6304,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"with more or less accuracy the first form of the author’s text, that"
6305,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,H₁YXG and a few more form a class in which correction and revision has
6306,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"taken place to some extent, but partially and unsystematically, and"
6307,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,that AJM &c. give us the first recension text in a much more fully
6308,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,revised and corrected form.
6309,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6310,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,It has been already said that F was originally a manuscript of
6311,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,the first recension. We shall find however that it did not exactly
6312,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,correspond to any existing first recension manuscript. Setting aside
6313,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the small number of individual mistakes to be found in it, there are"
6314,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,perhaps about eighty instances (many of a very trifling character) in
6315,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,which its text apparently differed originally from that of any first
6316,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"recension copy which we have, and in about half of these the text of F"
6317,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,agrees with that of the second recension. The manuscript which comes
6318,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"nearest to F in most respects is J (St. John’s Coll., Camb.), and there"
6319,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,is a considerable number of instances in which this MS. stands alone
6320,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,among first recension copies in agreement with the Fairfax text. In
6321,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the sixth book, for example, if J be set aside, there are at least"
6322,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,twenty-three passages in which F gives an apparently genuine reading
6323,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,unsupported by the first recension; but in sixteen of these cases J
6324,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"is in agreement with F. It must be noted, however, that this state of"
6325,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"things is not equally observable in the earlier part of the poem, and"
6326,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,indeed does not become at all marked until the fifth book.
6327,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6328,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Besides variations of reading, there are in the Fairfax MS. a few"
6329,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,additions to the text which are not found in any first recension
6330,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"copy. These are Prol. 495-498, 579-584 and i. 1403-1406, two passages"
6331,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"of four lines each and one of six, as well as some additions to the"
6332,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Latin notes in the margin (at Prol. 195, i. 2705, and v. 7725), of"
6333,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,which the first two were evidently put in later than the accompanying
6334,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"text. Finally, there are three other additions to the text which are"
6335,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"found in a single copy of the first recension, MS. Harl. 3490 (H₁)."
6336,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"These are i. 2267-2274, where four lines have been expanded into"
6337,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"eight, i. 2343-2358, an interesting addition of sixteen lines to the"
6338,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"tale of Narcissus, and i. 2369-2372. Thus in the matter of additions"
6339,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"to the text H₁ stands nearer to F than AJM &c., and in a few other"
6340,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,passages also it is found standing alone of its recension in company
6341,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"with F, e.g. i. 2043, 2398, ii. 2247. This manuscript does not belong"
6342,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"to the ‘fully revised’ group, but it gives the revised readings more"
6343,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,frequently perhaps than any other outside that group.
6344,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6345,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,Thus notwithstanding the differences between the first recension
6346,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"copies, as we have them, and the Fairfax MS. as it originally stood,"
6347,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,we shall have no difficulty in regarding the latter as having been
6348,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"originally a revised and corrected copy of that recension, exhibiting a"
6349,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"text to which tolerably near approaches are made by A, J, and H₁, each"
6350,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"in its own way, though no copy precisely corresponding to it is known"
6351,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,to exist.
6352,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6353,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Passing to the second recension, we must first repeat what has"
6354,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"already been said, that it did not supersede the first, but existed"
6355,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"and developed by its side, having its origin probably in the very"
6356,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"same year, or at latest in the next. Its characteristic point is the"
6357,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"presence of considerable additions in the fifth and seventh books,"
6358,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,together with a rearrangement of part of the sixth. There are seven
6359,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"manuscripts known to me, of which three are defective at the beginning."
6360,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"All these (except one, which is also defective at the end) have the"
6361,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"rewritten epilogue, one in combination with the Chaucer verses and the"
6362,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"others without them. Of the four which are perfect at the beginning,"
6363,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"one, namely B, has the earlier form of preface, and the other three,"
6364,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"ΛP₂ and S, the later. Of the others it is probable, but by no means"
6365,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"certain, that T agreed with B in this respect, and practically certain"
6366,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"that Δ agreed with S. A more satisfactory line of distinction, which"
6367,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"divides the manuscripts of this class into two groups, is given by the"
6368,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"general character of the text which they exhibit, and by the insertion"
6369,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,or omission of certain of the additional passages of which we have
6370,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"spoken. While some of the passages, viz. v. 6395*-6438*, 7086*-7210*,"
6371,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"vii. 3207*-3360*, are common to all the copies, as are also the"
6372,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,transposition of vi. 665-964 and (except in case of Λ) the omission of
6373,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"v. 7701-7746, three of them are found in AdBTΛP₂ only, and are omitted"
6374,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"in SΔ[AG], viz. v. 7015*-7036*, vii. 2329*-2340* and 3149*-3180*."
6375,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Then, as regards the text generally, the five MSS. first mentioned all"
6376,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,have connexions of various kinds with the unrevised form of the first
6377,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"recension, while the last two represent a type which, except as regards"
6378,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"variants specially characteristic of the second recension, of which"
6379,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"there may be about sixty in all, nearly corresponds with that of the"
6380,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,Fairfax MS.[AH]
6381,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6382,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,The relations of the group AdBTΛP₂ with the first recension and
6383,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"with one another are difficult to clear up satisfactorily. Broadly,"
6384,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,it may be said that of these B represents an earlier type than the
6385,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,rest in regard to correction and Λ in regard to revision: that is to
6386,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"say, B retains a large number of first recension errors which do not"
6387,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"appear in the rest (sharing some, however, with Λ), while at the same"
6388,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"time, in cases where a line has been rewritten B almost regularly"
6389,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"has the altered form, though with some exceptions in the first two"
6390,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"books. On the other hand, though it often happens that Λ is free from"
6391,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"original errors which appear in B, yet in many places where B has"
6392,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the revised form of text Λ gives us the original, in agreement with"
6393,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the earlier first recension type, while in others Λ agrees with B in"
6394,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"giving the revised reading. Then again, there can be no doubt of the"
6395,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"close connexion between B and T, but the agreement between them is"
6396,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,not usually on those points in which B follows the first recension
6397,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"in error. It is as if they had been derived from the same archetype,"
6398,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,but T (or a manuscript from which T was copied) sprang from it at a
6399,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"later stage than the original of B, when many of the errors noted in"
6400,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the first recension had been corrected, while the text of the book"
6401,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"generally was allowed to remain as it was[AI]. Finally, the text of Ad"
6402,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,approaches very near to a fully revised and corrected type. It very
6403,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"occasionally reproduces the earlier first recension, as if by accident,"
6404,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,but seems never deliberately to give an ‘unrevised’ reading. It should
6405,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,be observed that from a point towards the end of the fifth book (about
6406,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,v. 6280) AdBT is a group which is very frequently found in special
6407,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"agreement, whereas before that point we usually find BT (or BTΛ) with"
6408,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,Ad on the other side.
6409,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6410,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Passing now to the third recension, which has the preface and epilogue"
6411,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"as in Λ and S, but excludes the additional passages, we find it"
6412,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"represented by eight manuscripts, with Fairfax 3 at their head. We"
6413,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,have already seen that this manuscript was originally one of the first
6414,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"recension, and was altered by the author so as to substitute the new"
6415,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"epilogue and the new preface. Besides these changes, fresh lines are in"
6416,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"several places written over erasures, as i. 2713 f., iv. 1321 f., 1361"
6417,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"f., &c., the marginal date is erased at Prol. 331, and additions have"
6418,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"been made to the marginal notes. All these alterations, as well as the"
6419,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"points previously noted, in which F originally differed from the other"
6420,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"copies of the first recension, are reproduced in the other MSS. of the"
6421,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,third recension.
6422,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6423,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Of these remaining MSS. one is directly copied from F, and another"
6424,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"seems to be certainly derived from the same source, though perhaps"
6425,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,not immediately. In the case of H₃ (MS. Harl. 7184) the question of
6426,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,origin is not quite so simple. Its text generally seems to suggest
6427,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"ultimate dependence on F, but it is very unequal as regards accuracy,"
6428,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,and in one part it regularly follows the early first recension readings
6429,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,and seems to belong for the time to the ERCLB₂ group. In addition to
6430,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"this it has a Latin marginal note at the beginning of the Prologue,"
6431,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,which is wanting in F. The problem is perhaps to be solved by means
6432,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"of the Keswick MS. This is written in several hands, varying greatly"
6433,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"in accuracy, and exactly in that place where H₃ seems to follow a"
6434,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"first recension copy the Keswick MS. is defective, having lost several"
6435,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"leaves. It also contains the marginal note referred to above, and on"
6436,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,examination we find that a whole series of corruptions are common to
6437,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,the two MSS. There seems to be very little doubt that K is the source
6438,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"of H₃, the inequality of the latter MS. being to a great extent in"
6439,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"accordance with the change of hands in K, and the variation of H₃ in"
6440,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,a portion of the third book to a different type of text being exactly
6441,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"coincident with the gap left in K by loss of leaves, a loss which must"
6442,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,apparently have taken place in the first forty or fifty years of its
6443,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"existence[AJ]. As to the text of K itself, in the parts which are most"
6444,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"carefully written it reproduces that of F with scrupulous exactness,"
6445,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"giving every detail of orthography and punctuation, and for the most"
6446,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,part following it in such small errors as it has. It is impossible for
6447,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"one who places these MSS. side by side, as I have been able to do,"
6448,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,to avoid the conviction that in some parts at least the exemplar for
6449,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"K was the Fairfax MS. itself. On the other hand, the Latin marginal"
6450,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"note at the beginning was derived from some other copy, and setting"
6451,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"aside the many mistakes, which possibly are due to mere carelessness"
6452,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"on the part of some of the scribes, the Keswick MS. does undoubtedly"
6453,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,contain some readings which seem to be derived from a different source.
6454,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"In form of text generally it corresponds exactly with F, reproducing"
6455,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"all the additions and corrections made by erasure or otherwise, and"
6456,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,containing the same Latin and French pieces in the same order at the
6457,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"end, so far at least as it is perfect. The Magdalen College MS. must"
6458,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"be derived ultimately from the same source as H₃, and it has the same"
6459,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"lapse from the third recension to the first, coinciding with the gap"
6460,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"in the Keswick book. On the other hand W, though in form of text it"
6461,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"corresponds with these and with F, is quite independent of the group"
6462,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"above mentioned, and probably also of the Fairfax MS. It is late"
6463,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"and full of corruptions, but in several instances it assists in the"
6464,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"correction of errors which appear in F, and it is apparently based on"
6465,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,a copy which retained some of the variants of the earlier text still
6466,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,uncorrected.
6467,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6468,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"As for the remaining manuscript, which was formerly in the Phillipps"
6469,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"collection, but is now in the hands of a bookseller, I have had so"
6470,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,little opportunity for examining it that I ought not to attempt a
6471,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,classification.
6472,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6473,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Reviewing the whole body of authorities, we can recognize readily"
6474,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"that two are pre-eminent as witnesses for the author’s final text,"
6475,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"that is to say, S and F, the Stafford and the Fairfax MSS. These"
6476,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"are practically identical in orthography, and, except as regards"
6477,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the characteristic differences, which sufficiently guarantee their"
6478,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"independence, exhibit essentially the same text, and one which bears"
6479,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,the strongest marks of authenticity. Both are contemporary with the
6480,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"author, and it is perhaps difficult to say which best represents his"
6481,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,final judgement as to the form of his work.
6482,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,
6483,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"The Stafford MS. seems to be the earlier in time, that is to say,"
6484,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,it probably precedes the final conversion of the Fairfax copy. It
6485,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,was evidently written for presentation to a member of the house of
6486,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"Lancaster, perhaps to Henry himself before his accession to the throne."
6487,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,It was doubtless for some such presentation copy that the preface was
6488,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"rewritten in 1392-3, with the dedication to Henry introduced into the"
6489,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"English text, while most of the other copies issued during Richard’s"
6490,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,reign probably retained their original form. If we suppose that the new
6491,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,forms of preface and epilogue were at first intended only for private
6492,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"circulation, we can account for the very considerable preponderance of"
6493,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,the first recension in regard to the number of copies by which it is
6494,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"represented, and also allow sufficient time for the gradual development"
6495,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"of the text, first into the type which we find in A or J, and finally"
6496,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"into that of F, as it originally stood, a process which can hardly"
6497,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,be satisfactorily understood if we suppose that from 1393 onwards
6498,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,the Lancastrian dedication had its place in all copies put forth by
6499,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the author. It seems on the whole probable, for reasons to be stated"
6500,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"afterwards, that the final conversion of F (that is as regards the"
6501,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"preface) did not take place until after the deposition of Richard, and"
6502,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,it is reasonable enough to suppose that copies were usually issued in
6503,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,"the original form, until after that event occurred."

6510,(2) O. E. LONG VOWELS AND DIPHTHONGS.,they have given me the use of them. I am indebted especially to the

6542,FIRST RECENSION.,"book except the fifth, and one miniature on f. 8, of the Confession,"
6543,FIRST RECENSION.,remarkable for the fact that the figure of the Lover is evidently
6544,FIRST RECENSION.,"intended as a portrait of the author, being that of an old man and"
6545,FIRST RECENSION.,with some resemblance in features to the effigy on Gower’s tomb. The
6546,FIRST RECENSION.,"Confessor has a red stole, which with his right hand he is laying on"
6547,FIRST RECENSION.,"the penitent’s head, much as in the miniatures which we have in C and"
6548,FIRST RECENSION.,"L. The note for the miniaturist still stands in the margin, ‘Hic fiat"
6549,FIRST RECENSION.,confessor sedens _et_ confes_sus_ cora_m_ se genuflectendo.’
6550,FIRST RECENSION.,
6551,FIRST RECENSION.,"The first leaf of the book is lost, and has been supplied in the"
6552,FIRST RECENSION.,sixteenth cent. from Berthelette’s second edition. It should be noted
6553,FIRST RECENSION.,that this is not the form of commencement which belongs properly to
6554,FIRST RECENSION.,"the MS., being that of the third recension, taken by Berthelette from"
6555,FIRST RECENSION.,Caxton. The first line of f. 2 is Prol. 144.

6557,FIRST RECENSION.,"As to former possessors, we find written on the last leaf ‘Anniballis"

6559,FIRST RECENSION.,"115 ‘Elyzebeth Gardnar my troust ys in god,’ all apparently sixteenth"
6560,FIRST RECENSION.,cent. The first name is evidently that of Claude d’Annebaut (also
6561,FIRST RECENSION.,"called d’Hannybal), who was Admiral of France, and died in 1552. He"
6562,FIRST RECENSION.,was in England about the year 1547. The book came to the Bodleian from
6563,FIRST RECENSION.,"Gilbert Dolben, Esq., of Finedon, in Northamptonshire, in the year"
6564,FIRST RECENSION.,"1697, and not being in the Catalogue of 1697, it has to some extent"
6565,FIRST RECENSION.,escaped notice.
6566,FIRST RECENSION.,
6567,FIRST RECENSION.,The text is a very good one of the revised type. It should be
6568,FIRST RECENSION.,"noted, however, that while in the earlier books AJM &c. stand"
6569,FIRST RECENSION.,very frequently together on the side of F as against the rest
6570,FIRST RECENSION.,"of the first recension, in the later, and especially in the"
6571,FIRST RECENSION.,"seventh and eighth, AM &c. have an increasing tendency to stand"
6572,FIRST RECENSION.,"with the first recension generally, leaving J alone in support"
6573,FIRST RECENSION.,of the corrected text. In the earlier books A sometimes stands
6574,FIRST RECENSION.,"alone in this manner, as i. 1960, ii. 961, 1356."
6575,FIRST RECENSION.,
6576,FIRST RECENSION.,The orthography (especially that of the second hand) is nearly
6577,FIRST RECENSION.,"that of F. As regards final _e_, the tendency is rather to"
6578,FIRST RECENSION.,insert wrongly than to omit. Punctuation agrees generally with
6579,FIRST RECENSION.,that of F.

6589,FIRST RECENSION.,decorations except red and blue capitals. Old wooden binding.
6590,FIRST RECENSION.,
6591,FIRST RECENSION.,The seventh leaf of quire 12 (v. 57-213) and the first of quire 14 (v.
6592,FIRST RECENSION.,"1615-1770) are cut out, and a passage of 184 lines is omitted in the"
6593,FIRST RECENSION.,"first book (i. 631-814) without loss of leaf, which shows that the"
6594,FIRST RECENSION.,"manuscript from which it was copied, and which here must have lost a"
6595,FIRST RECENSION.,"leaf, had the normal number of 46 lines to the column."
6596,FIRST RECENSION.,
6597,FIRST RECENSION.,"Various names, as Thomas Browne, Nicolas Helifax, J. Baynorde, are"
6598,FIRST RECENSION.,"written in the book, and also ‘John Nicholas oweth this book,’ with"
6599,FIRST RECENSION.,"the date 1576. At the beginning we find ‘Tho. C. S.’, which stands for"
6600,FIRST RECENSION.,‘Thomas Comes Southampton.’ The book was in fact bought with others by
6601,FIRST RECENSION.,"Thomas Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, from William Crashaw, Fellow"
6602,FIRST RECENSION.,"of St. John’s College, and presented by him to the College Library in"
6603,FIRST RECENSION.,the year 1635.
6604,FIRST RECENSION.,
6605,FIRST RECENSION.,This MS. gives a text which is nearer to the type of F than
6606,FIRST RECENSION.,that of any other first recension copy. In the later books
6607,FIRST RECENSION.,especially it seems often to stand alone of its class in
6608,FIRST RECENSION.,"agreement with F, as v. 649, 1112, 1339, 1578, 3340, 4351,"
6609,FIRST RECENSION.,"4643, 5242, 6059, 6461, 6771, vi. 162, 442, 784, 973, 2089,"
6610,FIRST RECENSION.,"vii. 445, 1027, 1666, 2424, 3235, 4336, 5348, viii. 13, 239,"
6611,FIRST RECENSION.,"747, 845, 1076, 1415, 1456 ff., 2195, 2220, 2228, 2442,"
6612,FIRST RECENSION.,"2670 ff., and it is noteworthy that this is the only first"
6613,FIRST RECENSION.,recension copy which supplies the accidental omission of ‘eorum
6614,FIRST RECENSION.,disciplina--materia’ in the author’s Latin account of the
6615,FIRST RECENSION.,_Conf. Amantis_ at the end. As regards individual correctness
6616,FIRST RECENSION.,"it is rather unequal. In some places it has many mistakes, as"
6617,FIRST RECENSION.,"vi. 1509 ff., while in others it is very correct. The spelling"
6618,FIRST RECENSION.,"is in most points like that of F, and it is usually good as"
6619,FIRST RECENSION.,regards terminations; but the scribe has some peculiarities of
6620,FIRST RECENSION.,"his own, which he introduces more or less freely, as ‘ho’ for"
6621,FIRST RECENSION.,"‘who,’ ‘heo’ for ‘sche’ (pretty regularly), ‘heor’ for ‘her,’"
6622,FIRST RECENSION.,‘whech’ for ‘which.’ It must also be an individual fancy which
6623,FIRST RECENSION.,leads him regularly to substitute ‘som tyme’ for ‘whilom’
6624,FIRST RECENSION.,wherever it occurs. Punctuation usually agrees with that of F.

6629,FIRST RECENSION.,"double columns of 46 lines: Latin summaries usually in margin, but"
6630,FIRST RECENSION.,"occasionally in the text, as in A. Several hands, as follows, (1) ff."
6631,FIRST RECENSION.,"1-32, 41-64, 73-88, 97-136, 145-152, 161-176; (2) ff. 33-40, 89-96,"
6632,FIRST RECENSION.,137-144; (3) ff. 65-72; (4) ff. 153-160; (5) ff. 177-183. Finally
6633,FIRST RECENSION.,"another, different from all the above, adds sometimes a marginal note"
6634,FIRST RECENSION.,"which has been dropped, as on ff. 4, 32 v^o, 65, 72 v^o. The first"
6635,FIRST RECENSION.,"hand, in which more than two-thirds of the book is written, is fairly"
6636,FIRST RECENSION.,"neat: the third much rougher than the rest, and also more inaccurate."
6637,FIRST RECENSION.,
6638,FIRST RECENSION.,Floreated half border in fairly good style at the beginning of each

6640,FIRST RECENSION.,"painted miniatures, viz. f. 4 v^o, Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (the king in"
6641,FIRST RECENSION.,"bed, crowned), and f. 8, the Confession, a curious little picture in"
6642,FIRST RECENSION.,"the margin. The priest is laying his stole on the head of the penitent,"
6643,FIRST RECENSION.,whose features are evidently meant for a portrait. It is quite
6644,FIRST RECENSION.,different however from that which we have in A. Below this picture we
6645,FIRST RECENSION.,"find the note, ‘Hic fiat Garn_imentum_.’"
6646,FIRST RECENSION.,
6647,FIRST RECENSION.,"The last leaf is lost, containing no doubt the ‘Explicit,’ ‘Quam"
6648,FIRST RECENSION.,"cinxere,’ and ‘Quia vnusquisque,’ as in A."
6649,FIRST RECENSION.,
6650,FIRST RECENSION.,The names Stanhope and Yelverton are written on f. 39 (sixteenth
6651,FIRST RECENSION.,"cent.), and ‘Margareta Straunge’ on the first leaf (seventeenth cent.)."
6652,FIRST RECENSION.,Later the book belonged to Bishop Moore of Norwich (No. 462 in his
6653,FIRST RECENSION.,"library), and it passed with the rest of his books to the University of"
6654,FIRST RECENSION.,"Cambridge in 1715, as a gift from the king."
6655,FIRST RECENSION.,
6656,FIRST RECENSION.,"M is very closely connected with A, as is shown by very many"
6657,FIRST RECENSION.,"instances of special agreement, and some considerations suggest"
6658,FIRST RECENSION.,"that it may be actually derived from it, as for example the"
6659,FIRST RECENSION.,"writing of the Latin verses in the margin after f. 80, which"
6660,FIRST RECENSION.,"in A seems to be connected with a change of hand, whereas in"
6661,FIRST RECENSION.,M it begins at the same point without any such reason. On
6662,FIRST RECENSION.,the other hand M has a good many readings which are clearly
6663,FIRST RECENSION.,"independent, either correcting mistakes and omissions in A, as"
6664,FIRST RECENSION.,"Prol. 195 _marg._, 937, i. 673 _marg._, 924, 1336, 3445, ii."
6665,FIRST RECENSION.,"951, iii. 2529, vi. 620, or giving an early reading where A has"
6666,FIRST RECENSION.,"a later, e.g. Prol. 869, i. 1118, 1755, ii. 961, 3516, iii."
6667,FIRST RECENSION.,"1939, v. 3914, 5524, &c. In correctness of text and of spelling"

6691,FIRST RECENSION.,
6692,FIRST RECENSION.,"The first leaf is lost, the MS. beginning Prol. 193, and also two"
6693,FIRST RECENSION.,leaves in the second quire (i. 1092-1491) and one in the tenth
6694,FIRST RECENSION.,(viii. 2111-2343); but besides these imperfections there are many
6695,FIRST RECENSION.,"omissions, apparently because the copyist got tired of his work, e.g."
6696,FIRST RECENSION.,"ii. 3155-3184, iii. 41-126, 817-842, 877-930, 1119-1196, iv. 17-72,"
6697,FIRST RECENSION.,"261-370, 569-704, 710-722, 915-968, 1117-1236, v. 72-112. There is also"
6698,FIRST RECENSION.,a good deal of omission and confusion in v. 6101-7082. At the end in a
6699,FIRST RECENSION.,"scroll is written ‘Notehurste,’ which indicates probably that the book"
6700,FIRST RECENSION.,"was copied for one of the Chethams of Nuthurst, perhaps Thomas Chetham,"
6701,FIRST RECENSION.,who died 1504. The word ‘Notehurst’ also occurs at the end of the

6711,FIRST RECENSION.,"in., in quires of 8 with catchwords; neatly written in double column"
6712,FIRST RECENSION.,of 40 lines (or 39). No Latin summaries or verses. The handwriting
6713,FIRST RECENSION.,changes after f. 62 (at iii. 2164) and becomes rather larger and more
6714,FIRST RECENSION.,ornamental.
6715,FIRST RECENSION.,
6716,FIRST RECENSION.,"Two leaves lost after f. 35, containing ii. 1066-1377, and some of the"
6717,FIRST RECENSION.,"leaves of the MS. from which it was copied had been displaced, so that"

6723,FIRST RECENSION.,"been written for Thomas Mompesson of Bathampton, sheriff of Wilts in"

6727,FIRST RECENSION.,
6728,FIRST RECENSION.,The text is a combination of two types. It has the Lancaster
6729,FIRST RECENSION.,"dedication at the beginning, but the conclusion which belongs"
6730,FIRST RECENSION.,to the first recension. On examination it proves that the
6731,FIRST RECENSION.,scribe who wrote the first eight quires followed a manuscript
6732,FIRST RECENSION.,"not of the F, but of the SΔ class (agreeing for example with"
6733,FIRST RECENSION.,"S in i. 1881 f., 2017 ff., ii. 2387, iii. 168, 1241, and"
6734,FIRST RECENSION.,"differing from F in regard to i. 2267 ff., 2343 ff., &c.),"
6735,FIRST RECENSION.,while the copyist of the remainder followed one of the revised

6776,FIRST RECENSION.,"not rank high, and it is especially bad as regards insertion"

6798,FIRST RECENSION.,
6799,FIRST RECENSION.,"This is a good manuscript, carefully written and finely"

6860,FIRST RECENSION.,in quires of 8 with catchwords: well and regularly written in double
6861,FIRST RECENSION.,"column of 46 lines, early fifteenth century. Latin summaries in the"
6862,FIRST RECENSION.,"text (red). Floreated page at the beginning of each book, so far as"
6863,FIRST RECENSION.,"they remain, and illuminated capitals. Many catchwords lost by cutting"
6864,FIRST RECENSION.,of the margin: it must once have been a very large book.
6865,FIRST RECENSION.,
6866,FIRST RECENSION.,"The manuscript has lost about sixteen leaves at the end, and eight"
6867,FIRST RECENSION.,"altogether in various other places. In every case except one, however,"
6868,FIRST RECENSION.,"the place of the lost leaf is supplied by a new leaf inserted, one of"
6869,FIRST RECENSION.,which has the missing portion of the text copied out from an early
6870,FIRST RECENSION.,"edition, while the rest are blank. The leaves lost are mostly such as"
6871,FIRST RECENSION.,"would probably have had miniatures or illuminations, including the"
6872,FIRST RECENSION.,"beginning of the first, second, sixth, seventh, and eighth books. The"
6873,FIRST RECENSION.,"losses are as follows: f. 4 (containing Prol. 504-657, probably with a"
6874,FIRST RECENSION.,"miniature), text supplied by later hand, f. 7 (Prol. 984-i. 30), f. 9"
6875,FIRST RECENSION.,"(i. 199-336, probably with a miniature), f. 28 (i. 3402-ii. 108), f."
6876,FIRST RECENSION.,"129 (131) (v. 7718-vi. 40), f. 143 (145) (vi. 2343-vii. 60), a leaf"
6877,FIRST RECENSION.,"after f. 175 (177) (vii. 5399-viii. 126), f. 177 (179) (viii. 271-441),"
6878,FIRST RECENSION.,"and all after f. 179 (181), that is from viii. 783 to the end."
6879,FIRST RECENSION.,
6880,FIRST RECENSION.,"A former owner (seventeenth cent.) says, ‘This Book, as I was told by"
6881,FIRST RECENSION.,"the Gent: who presented it to me, did originally belong to the Abbey of"
6882,FIRST RECENSION.,"Bury in Suffolk.’ If so, the _Confessio Amantis_ was probably read in"
6883,FIRST RECENSION.,this copy by Lydgate.
6884,FIRST RECENSION.,
6885,FIRST RECENSION.,"I am under great obligations to Dr. Young, Librarian of the Hunterian"
6886,FIRST RECENSION.,"Museum, for the trouble he has taken to give me access to this"
6887,FIRST RECENSION.,excellent manuscript.
6888,FIRST RECENSION.,
6889,FIRST RECENSION.,"The Glasgow MS. is especially related to X (iv. 2773, v. 1486,"
6890,FIRST RECENSION.,"3582, 3688, 4110, 6848 ff., vi. 101, vii. 769, &c.), and"
6891,FIRST RECENSION.,"belongs more generally to the group H₁X &c., which passes over"
6892,FIRST RECENSION.,to the revised class almost completely in a considerable part
6893,FIRST RECENSION.,"of the fifth book. The text, however, is on the whole much"
6894,FIRST RECENSION.,"better than that of X, being both individually more correct and"
6895,FIRST RECENSION.,"more frequently found on the side of the corrected readings,"
6896,FIRST RECENSION.,"e.g. i. 2836, ii. 1441, 1867, v. 781, 1203, 2996, 4425, 5966,"
6897,FIRST RECENSION.,"6839, 7223, 7630, vi. 86, 746 (corrected), 1437, vii. 510,"
6898,FIRST RECENSION.,"1361, 1574, 2337, 3902, viii. 568. In at least one place, vii."
6899,FIRST RECENSION.,"1574, it stands alone of the first recension, while in others,"
6900,FIRST RECENSION.,"as v. 4425, 5966, 7630, vi. 746, 1437, &c., it is accompanied"
6901,FIRST RECENSION.,"only by J. On the other hand in some passages, as v. 5802,"
6902,FIRST RECENSION.,"6019, 6257, vii. 1172 _marg._ &c., G has an earlier reading and"
6903,FIRST RECENSION.,"X the later, while there is also a whole series of passages"
6904,FIRST RECENSION.,"where G, sometimes in company with X, seems to show a special"
6905,FIRST RECENSION.,"connexion of some kind with B (BT), as ii. 1925, iii. 733, iv."
6906,FIRST RECENSION.,"2295, 2508, v. 4, 536, 2508, 3964, 4072, 7048, vi. 1267, 1733,"
6907,FIRST RECENSION.,"vii. 3748, 4123, &c."
6908,FIRST RECENSION.,
6909,FIRST RECENSION.,"The book is carefully written, and corrected in the same hand,"
6910,FIRST RECENSION.,"e.g. v. 3145, 5011, vi. 430, 746, vii. 4233. The spelling is"
6911,FIRST RECENSION.,"pretty good, and in particular it is a contrast to X in the"
6912,FIRST RECENSION.,"matter of final _e_. This is seldom wrongly inserted, and when"
6913,FIRST RECENSION.,it is omitted it is usually in places where the metre is not
6914,FIRST RECENSION.,"affected by it. Punctuation often in the course of the line,"
6915,FIRST RECENSION.,but not at the end.

6930,FIRST RECENSION.,
6931,FIRST RECENSION.,"In text this belongs to the XG group, agreeing with them, for"
6932,FIRST RECENSION.,"example, at v. 3688, 6848, and in general with H₁XG, where they"
6933,FIRST RECENSION.,"go together (so far as I have examined the book), e.g. in the"
6934,FIRST RECENSION.,"Latin verses after v. 2858 (‘Vltra testes falsos,’ ‘penitus’)"
6935,FIRST RECENSION.,"and in the readings of v. 1893, 1906, 2694, 3110, &c."
6936,FIRST RECENSION.,
6937,FIRST RECENSION.,The handwriting is somewhat like that of H₁: the spelling

6957,FIRST RECENSION.,"are lost and f. 32 is damaged (iii. 1150-iv. 1517), after f. 81 one"

6959,FIRST RECENSION.,
6960,FIRST RECENSION.,"Bought by Brit. Museum from Thos. Kerslake of Bristol, 1857."
6961,FIRST RECENSION.,
6962,FIRST RECENSION.,"The text is closely connected with that of X, but not copied"
6963,FIRST RECENSION.,"from that manuscript itself (see ii. 1711, vii. 92, viii."
6964,FIRST RECENSION.,2650). There are corrections here and there in a somewhat later

6966,FIRST RECENSION.,"of which are cases of lines supplied, which had been dropped."
6967,FIRST RECENSION.,In v. 3688 the ordinary reading has been substituted doubtless
6968,FIRST RECENSION.,"for that of X, and in some cases the alterations are wrong, as"
6969,FIRST RECENSION.,"vii. 2639, viii. 51. The manuscript has a good many individual"

6984,FIRST RECENSION.,"and the last leaf containing ‘Explicit,’ &c., is placed now at the"
6985,FIRST RECENSION.,beginning of the volume. There is a confusion of the text in the third
6986,FIRST RECENSION.,"book, iii. 236-329 being repeated after 678 and 679-766 left out, also"
6987,FIRST RECENSION.,a considerable omission in the fourth (iv. 2033-3148) without loss of
6988,FIRST RECENSION.,leaves in this MS. (The statement in the MS. that seven leaves are here
6989,FIRST RECENSION.,lost is a mistake.) In the passage vii. 1486-2678 several leaves have
6990,FIRST RECENSION.,been disarranged in the quire.
6991,FIRST RECENSION.,
6992,FIRST RECENSION.,"Given to the College in 1740 by Wm. Bohun of Beccles (Suffolk), to"

6995,FIRST RECENSION.,
6996,FIRST RECENSION.,"The text is of a rather irregular type, but often agrees with"
6997,FIRST RECENSION.,the XGO group. It has many mistakes and the spelling is poor.
6998,FIRST RECENSION.,
6999,FIRST RECENSION.,"Q. Belonged to the late Mr. B. Quaritch, who kindly allowed me to"

7004,FIRST RECENSION.,"on f. 3, of a rather unusual type--the priest seated to the left of the"
7005,FIRST RECENSION.,picture and the penitent at a little distance. Latin summaries in text
7006,FIRST RECENSION.,"(red). Begins with Prol. 342, having lost two leaves here, and has lost"
7007,FIRST RECENSION.,"also Prol. 529-688, Prol. 842-i. 85, and perhaps more."
7008,FIRST RECENSION.,
7009,FIRST RECENSION.,The book formerly belonged to a Marquess of Hastings.
7010,FIRST RECENSION.,
7011,FIRST RECENSION.,"This is a good manuscript, and the spelling is fairly correct."
7012,FIRST RECENSION.,"I place it provisionally here, because its readings seem to"

7023,FIRST RECENSION.,finely painted miniature of the Confession on f. 7 v^o.
7024,FIRST RECENSION.,
7025,FIRST RECENSION.,"Two leaves lost, originally ff. 1 and 3, containing Prol. 1-134 and"
7026,FIRST RECENSION.,"454-594. The book has also suffered from damp, and parts of the first"
7027,FIRST RECENSION.,and last leaves are so discoloured as to be illegible.
7028,FIRST RECENSION.,
7029,FIRST RECENSION.,A seventeenth cent. note on f. 1 v^o tells us that the book was given
7030,FIRST RECENSION.,"on April 5, 1609, ‘at Skarborough Castle’ to the lady Eliz. Dymoke by"
7031,FIRST RECENSION.,"her aunt the lady Catherine Burghe, daughter of Lord Clynton, who was"
7032,FIRST RECENSION.,"afterwards earl of Lincoln and Lord High Admiral, to whom it came by"
7033,FIRST RECENSION.,"her mother, the lady Eliz. Talboys. On f. 2 we find the register of"
7034,FIRST RECENSION.,"the birth of Master Harry Clinton, son and heir of Lord Clinton, born"
7035,FIRST RECENSION.,"at Canbery, June 6, 1542. The name Willoughby occurs also in the book"
7036,FIRST RECENSION.,"(sixteenth cent.), and on a flyleaf inserted at the beginning we find"
7037,FIRST RECENSION.,"‘John Brograve, 1682,’ with Latin lines in the form of an acrostic"
7038,FIRST RECENSION.,"about his family, signed ‘Thomas Tragiscus, Bohemus.’ Bought by the"
7039,FIRST RECENSION.,"Brit. Mus. August 6, 1865, at Lord Charlemont’s sale."
7040,FIRST RECENSION.,
7041,FIRST RECENSION.,The text of this fine MS. belongs clearly to the unrevised
7042,FIRST RECENSION.,group. At the same time its original must have had some
7043,FIRST RECENSION.,"corrections, and some also appear on the face of this MS. It"
7044,FIRST RECENSION.,"stands alone of the first recension in agreement with S, F in"
7045,FIRST RECENSION.,"a few passages, as v. 5438, vi. 1954, vii. 4318 _marg._, and"
7046,FIRST RECENSION.,"with J in ii. 2576, iii. 176, v. 4989 f., 7327, vii. 3484. It"
7047,FIRST RECENSION.,"has also some connexion with B (BTΛ), standing in this matter"
7048,FIRST RECENSION.,"either with C (or YC), as iii. 633, v. 3688, 3814, 5667, 6318,"
7049,FIRST RECENSION.,"or by itself, as Prol. 169, i. 2122, ii. 1353, iv. 3401, v."

7051,FIRST RECENSION.,
7052,FIRST RECENSION.,"The scribe seems to have had a good ear for metre, and seldom"
7053,FIRST RECENSION.,"goes wrong in any point of spelling which affects the verse,"
7054,FIRST RECENSION.,"though apt to omit final _e_ in case of elision. Sometimes,"
7055,FIRST RECENSION.,"however, he drops words, as ‘swerd,’ i. 433, ‘so,’ v. 122,"
7056,FIRST RECENSION.,"‘chaste,’ v. 6277. On the whole the text of E is probably the"
7057,FIRST RECENSION.,best of its class.

7070,FIRST RECENSION.,
7071,FIRST RECENSION.,We find on the last leaf in a hand perhaps as early as the fifteenth
7072,FIRST RECENSION.,"cent. ‘Liber partinet Thomam Crispe Ciuem et Mercerium Londiniarum,’"
7073,FIRST RECENSION.,"and on the flyleaf at the beginning a device containing the same name,"
7074,FIRST RECENSION.,"and also A. Crispe, F. Crispe, W. Rawson, Anne Rawson. ‘Augusten Crispe"
7075,FIRST RECENSION.,"me Iure tenet’ is written on the first leaf of the text, and also"
7076,FIRST RECENSION.,"‘Liber Willelmi Rawson A^o. Dni 1580.’ Finally, ‘Liber C. C. C. Oxon."
7077,FIRST RECENSION.,1676.’ The device referred to above appears also in the decoration of
7078,FIRST RECENSION.,"the book both at the beginning and the end, but the manuscript must"

7145,FIRST RECENSION.,by the Garter and its motto. The arms are those of Charles Brandon duke
7146,FIRST RECENSION.,"of Suffolk (Brandon with quartering of Bruyn and Rokeley, see Doyle,"
7147,FIRST RECENSION.,"_Official Baronage_, iii. 443), and on the same page is painted the"
7148,FIRST RECENSION.,"Brandon crest (lion’s head erased, crowned per pale gules and arg.,"
7149,FIRST RECENSION.,langued az.). These must have been painted in later than the date of
7150,FIRST RECENSION.,the MS. The binding is deeply stamped with the arms of Great Britain
7151,FIRST RECENSION.,"and Ireland in colours, and the letters I. R., showing that the book"
7152,FIRST RECENSION.,"belonged to James I. It was presented to the Bodleian by Dr. John King,"
7153,FIRST RECENSION.,who was Dean of Ch. Ch. 1605-1611. We must suppose that James gave it
7154,FIRST RECENSION.,to Dr. King.
7155,FIRST RECENSION.,
7156,FIRST RECENSION.,The fineness of the vellum and the general style of the book
7157,FIRST RECENSION.,seems to indicate that it was written for some distinguished
7158,FIRST RECENSION.,person. The text is very typical of its class. In correctness
7159,FIRST RECENSION.,"and spelling it is less good than L, oftener dropping final _e_"
7160,FIRST RECENSION.,and having less regard for the metre.

7178,FIRST RECENSION.,"from confusion between _þ_, _ȝ_, and _y_. Thus the scribe (who"
7179,FIRST RECENSION.,usually has _th_ for _þ_ and _y_ for _ȝ_) is capable of writing
7180,FIRST RECENSION.,"‘aþen’ or ‘athen’ for ‘aȝein,’ ‘yer of’ for ‘þer of,’ ‘yeff’"

7279,SECOND RECENSION.,"rudely painted miniature of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, in style resembling"
7280,SECOND RECENSION.,"that of F. This page has also three heraldic shields and a crest, of"
7281,SECOND RECENSION.,which more hereafter. Floreated half borders at the beginning of books
7282,SECOND RECENSION.,"and illuminated capitals throughout, well executed and with an unusual"

7285,SECOND RECENSION.,with an axe. This is part of the initial decoration of Lib. iv.
7286,SECOND RECENSION.,
7287,SECOND RECENSION.,"The book has unfortunately lost in all seventeen leaves, as follows:"
7288,SECOND RECENSION.,"one after f. 1 (Prol. 147-320), one after f. 7 (Prol. 1055-i. 106),"
7289,SECOND RECENSION.,"three after f. 46 (iii. 573-1112), one after f. 68 (iv. 2351-2530), two"

7293,SECOND RECENSION.,"153 (vii. 5417-viii. 336). In addition to this, one leaf, f. 50 (iii."
7294,SECOND RECENSION.,"1665-1848), is written in a different and probably rather later hand,"
7295,SECOND RECENSION.,and seems to have been inserted to supply the place of a leaf lost in
7296,SECOND RECENSION.,quite early times.
7297,SECOND RECENSION.,
7298,SECOND RECENSION.,The question about the former owners of this fine manuscript is an
7299,SECOND RECENSION.,"interesting one. As to the devices on the first page, the first shield"
7300,SECOND RECENSION.,"(within the initial O) is sable and gules per pale, a swan argent, the"
7301,SECOND RECENSION.,"second (in the lower margin) sable, three ostrich feathers (argent?)"
7302,SECOND RECENSION.,"set in three scrolls or, while in the right margin there is a crest of"
7303,SECOND RECENSION.,"a lion, collared with label of three points, standing on a chapeau, and"
7304,SECOND RECENSION.,"below is suspended a shield quartered az. and gules, with no device."
7305,SECOND RECENSION.,"The crest is evidently meant for that of John of Gaunt, though it is"
7306,SECOND RECENSION.,"not quite correct, and the three ostrich feathers (properly ermine)"
7307,SECOND RECENSION.,were used by him as a recognisance (see Sandford’s _Genealogical Hist._
7308,SECOND RECENSION.,"p. 249), while the swan is the well-known badge of Henry his son, to"
7309,SECOND RECENSION.,be seen suspended from Gower’s own collar of SS on his tomb and in
7310,SECOND RECENSION.,the miniature of the Fairfax MS. It seems probable then that the book
7311,SECOND RECENSION.,"was prepared for presentation to a member of the house of Lancaster,"
7312,SECOND RECENSION.,probably either John of Gaunt or Henry. If it be the fact that the swan
7313,SECOND RECENSION.,"badge was not adopted by Henry until 1397, this would not be the actual"
7314,SECOND RECENSION.,copy sent on the occasion of the dedication to him in 1392-93. On the
7315,SECOND RECENSION.,other hand the absence of all royal emblems indicates that the book was
7316,SECOND RECENSION.,prepared before Henry’s accession to the throne.
7317,SECOND RECENSION.,
7318,SECOND RECENSION.,In the sixteenth cent. (Queen Elizabeth’s reign) the book belonged to
7319,SECOND RECENSION.,"one William Downes, whose name is written more than once on f. 170. The"
7320,SECOND RECENSION.,"ornamental letters W. D. on f. 21 are probably his initials, and on f."
7321,SECOND RECENSION.,76 we have Phillipp Downes in a fifteenth-cent. hand. On f. 171 v^o
7322,SECOND RECENSION.,there is a note about ‘the parsonages of Gwend ... and Stythians in the
7323,SECOND RECENSION.,"county of Cornewell, percell of the possessions of the late monastary"
7324,SECOND RECENSION.,"of Rewley,’ and also about the ‘personage of Croppreadin in the county"
7325,SECOND RECENSION.,"of Oxforde,’ granted for xxi years by Edward VI and paying lvi pounds"
7326,SECOND RECENSION.,a year. ‘T. P. Goodwyn’ is another name (seventeenth cent.). When
7327,SECOND RECENSION.,"Todd saw the MS. at the beginning of this century, it belonged to the"
7328,SECOND RECENSION.,Marquess of Stafford.
7329,SECOND RECENSION.,
7330,SECOND RECENSION.,"S has the Lancaster dedication and the rewritten epilogue,"
7331,SECOND RECENSION.,"and with these the three additional passages, v. 6395*-6438*,"
7332,SECOND RECENSION.,"7086*-7210*, vii. 3207*-3360*, omitting v. 7701-7746, and"
7333,SECOND RECENSION.,transposing vi. 665-964. In correctness it is inferior only
7334,SECOND RECENSION.,"to F, and these two stand far above all others as primary"
7335,SECOND RECENSION.,"authorities. Their independence of one another is certain,"
7336,SECOND RECENSION.,and the general agreement of their text gives it the highest
7337,SECOND RECENSION.,guarantee of authenticity. The spelling is practically the
7338,SECOND RECENSION.,"same, as will be seen in those passages which are printed from"
7339,SECOND RECENSION.,"S in this edition, e.g. vii. 3207*-3360*, indeed in most places"
7340,SECOND RECENSION.,"the two texts are absolutely the same, letter for letter. As"
7341,SECOND RECENSION.,"regards f. 50, which is in a different hand, it should be"
7342,SECOND RECENSION.,"noted not only that it is far less correct than the rest, but"
7343,SECOND RECENSION.,"also that it is copied from a different original, a MS. of the"
7344,SECOND RECENSION.,"unrevised first recension, distinctive readings of which are"
7345,SECOND RECENSION.,"given in iii. 1686, 1763, 1800, 1806, while no trace of such"

7402,SECOND RECENSION.,"2329*-2340*, and 3149*-3180*, but does not seem fully to join"
7403,SECOND RECENSION.,the group until the latter part of the fifth book. In connexion
7404,SECOND RECENSION.,with this we may note the curious fact that the omitted
7405,SECOND RECENSION.,"passage, iii. 1665-1848, is precisely that contained in f. 50"
7406,SECOND RECENSION.,"of S, which apparently was supplied in place of a lost leaf. In"
7407,SECOND RECENSION.,"correctness and spelling the MS. is very fair, but not good in"
7408,SECOND RECENSION.,regard to final _e_. Punctuation often where there is a pause
7409,SECOND RECENSION.,in the line.

7426,SECOND RECENSION.,present with ii. 2687. Also the second col. of f. 84 r^o is left blank

7433,SECOND RECENSION.,and obviously having a special connexion in its readings with
7434,SECOND RECENSION.,"B. T, however, is of a more fully corrected type than B, and"
7435,SECOND RECENSION.,it must remain doubtful whether the preface of the poem in T
7436,SECOND RECENSION.,was of the earlier or the later form. In any case the original
7437,SECOND RECENSION.,"of the two, if (as it seems) they had a common original, was"
7438,SECOND RECENSION.,"not made up earlier than 1397, for the resemblance of the"
7439,SECOND RECENSION.,manuscripts extends to the French and Latin poems which follow
7440,SECOND RECENSION.,"the _Conf. Amantis_, and the last of these is dated the 20th"
7441,SECOND RECENSION.,year of king Richard.
7442,SECOND RECENSION.,
7443,SECOND RECENSION.,The third and fourth hands are neater and better than the
7444,SECOND RECENSION.,other two. The first is rather less correct and less good in
7445,SECOND RECENSION.,"spelling than the others, and also it omits the Latin marginal"
7446,SECOND RECENSION.,"notes. The parts written in this hand are ii. 2687-iii. 608, v."
7447,SECOND RECENSION.,"1415-2874, 5805-7082, v. 7545-vi. 1040, vi. 2201-vii. 2532."
7448,SECOND RECENSION.,
7449,SECOND RECENSION.,"With regard to the connexions within the group AdBTΛ, attention"
7450,SECOND RECENSION.,"may be drawn especially to v. 659, where Ad has the usual"
7451,SECOND RECENSION.,"reading, T omits the line, leaving a blank, while B and Λ have"
7452,SECOND RECENSION.,"bad lines made up for the occasion, to v. 4020, where Ad again"
7453,SECOND RECENSION.,"has the usual text, TΛ omit, and B has a made-up line, and to"
7454,SECOND RECENSION.,"v. 7303, where AdBT omit two lines necessary to the sense which"
7455,SECOND RECENSION.,Λ inserts. We may note the alteration by erasure in T of v.
7456,SECOND RECENSION.,"5936, apparently from the reading of the unrevised text."

7473,SECOND RECENSION.,"Form of text in v, vi, vii the same as AdT. We have in this"
7474,SECOND RECENSION.,MS. a combination of the early preface with the rewritten

7476,SECOND RECENSION.,"and which may have been that of T, as it certainly was of the"
7477,SECOND RECENSION.,MS. used by Berthelette. Something has already been said of
7478,SECOND RECENSION.,"the text of this MS., and for the rest sufficient information"
7479,SECOND RECENSION.,will be found in the critical apparatus. The spelling of B is
7480,SECOND RECENSION.,"exemplified in the passages printed from it, Prol. 24*-92*, v."
7481,SECOND RECENSION.,"7015*-7036*, vii. 2329*-2340*, 3149*-3180*. As in the case of"
7482,SECOND RECENSION.,"E, the copyist is careful of metre, and while omitting final"
7483,SECOND RECENSION.,"_e_ freely before a vowel, rarely does so where it affects"
7484,SECOND RECENSION.,"the metre, and seldom adds _-e_ unduly. There is hardly any"

7493,SECOND RECENSION.,"throughout, not painted. No leaves lost."
7494,SECOND RECENSION.,
7495,SECOND RECENSION.,The text of this MS. is in many ways interesting. It has
7496,SECOND RECENSION.,"Lancaster dedication, but in text it often seems to belong to"
7497,SECOND RECENSION.,the unrevised first recension; for though many of the errors
7498,SECOND RECENSION.,"of this group are found to be corrected in Λ, even in cases"
7499,SECOND RECENSION.,"where B retains them, as Prol. 7, 219, _Lat. Verses_ after 584,"
7500,SECOND RECENSION.,"812, 844, 937 f., i. 8, 54, 264, 278, &c., ii. 671, 833, &c.,"
7501,SECOND RECENSION.,"and though there are also many of the revised readings, as i."
7502,SECOND RECENSION.,"368, ii. 1758 ff. (in both of which B is unrevised), iv. 517,"
7503,SECOND RECENSION.,"766, 985 f., 2954, 3153, v. 30, 47 f., 82, 2694 f., 3110, &c.,"
7504,SECOND RECENSION.,"yet in many other places the original readings stand in Λ, as"
7505,SECOND RECENSION.,"i. 3374 ff., iv. 2407, 2556, v. 274, 316, 394, 1893, 1906 f.,"
7506,SECOND RECENSION.,"&c., where BT are revised. The characteristic second recension"
7507,SECOND RECENSION.,"readings are almost regularly given by Λ, which agrees with"
7508,SECOND RECENSION.,AdBT against SΔ in regard to the passages inserted; but there
7509,SECOND RECENSION.,are some important differences between this MS. and all others
7510,SECOND RECENSION.,"of its class, viz. (1) after v. 6430* it has a combination of"
7511,SECOND RECENSION.,first and second recensions. (2) v. 7701-7746 is inserted as in
7512,SECOND RECENSION.,the first and third recensions. (3) viii. 2941-2959 is inserted
7513,SECOND RECENSION.,as in the first recension (with the curious corruption ‘Cuther’
7514,SECOND RECENSION.,"for ‘Chaucer’), the rewritten epilogue being carried on from"
7515,SECOND RECENSION.,the line ‘Enclosed in a sterred skye.’
7516,SECOND RECENSION.,
7517,SECOND RECENSION.,"It will be observed that BTΛ often form a distinct group, as"
7518,SECOND RECENSION.,"(to take only a few examples) iv. 1567, 1996, 2034, 3132, 3138,"
7519,SECOND RECENSION.,"v. 654 ff., 4138, &c. We may note, however, v. 7303 f. which"
7520,SECOND RECENSION.,"are inserted by Λ, though omitted in AdBT, and the reading"
7521,SECOND RECENSION.,‘she’ in iv. 2973.

7528,SECOND RECENSION.,"in the border, and also a figure painted in the initial O. Two leaves"
7529,SECOND RECENSION.,"missing and supplied in blank after f. 1 (Prol. 154-509), and one later"
7530,SECOND RECENSION.,(vii. 3199-3382). On f. 1 v^o ‘Joh: Finch Comitis Winchilsea filius
7531,SECOND RECENSION.,1700.’
7532,SECOND RECENSION.,
7533,SECOND RECENSION.,A fine MS. of an early type. It has the Lancaster dedication
7534,SECOND RECENSION.,"in the Prologue and the later form of epilogue, and as regards"
7535,SECOND RECENSION.,the additional passages it agrees with AdBTΛ. In text P₂ is
7536,SECOND RECENSION.,"closely related to Λ, but it does not include v. 7701-7746 or"
7537,SECOND RECENSION.,"viii. 2941-2960, nor does it agree with Λ in v. 6431* ff. As"
7538,SECOND RECENSION.,"instances of their agreement we may cite Prol. 14, ‘It dwelleth"
7539,SECOND RECENSION.,"oft in,’ 115, ‘vneuened,’ 127, ‘ben nought diuided,’ &c. In the"
7540,SECOND RECENSION.,"marginal note of Prol. 22 P₂ has ‘sextodecimo,’ but the first"

7555,THIRD RECENSION.,"in., in quires of 8 with catchwords; the first quire begins at f. 2,"
7556,THIRD RECENSION.,the twenty-fourth quire has six leaves and the twenty-fifth (last)
7557,THIRD RECENSION.,three. The leaves of the seventh quire are disarranged and should
7558,THIRD RECENSION.,"be read in the following order, 50, 52, 53, 51, 56, 54, 55, 57. The"
7559,THIRD RECENSION.,"_Confessio Amantis_ is written in double column of 46 lines, in a very"
7560,THIRD RECENSION.,good hand of the end of the fourteenth cent. Latin summaries in the
7561,THIRD RECENSION.,"margin. Half borders, some with animal figures, at the beginning of"
7562,THIRD RECENSION.,"each book, and two miniatures, one at the beginning, rather large, of"
7563,THIRD RECENSION.,"Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, and the other on f. 8 of the Confession, in"
7564,THIRD RECENSION.,which the priest is dressed in green and has a wreath of roses on his
7565,THIRD RECENSION.,"head, while the penitent, whose features are damaged, wears a hood and"
7566,THIRD RECENSION.,"a collar of SS with a badge, probably a swan, dependent from it. This"
7567,THIRD RECENSION.,was no doubt intended as a portrait of the author: the collar and badge
7568,THIRD RECENSION.,have somewhat the appearance of having been added after the original
7569,THIRD RECENSION.,painting was made. The size of the illuminated capitals indicates
7570,THIRD RECENSION.,precisely the nature of the various divisions of the work.
7571,THIRD RECENSION.,
7572,THIRD RECENSION.,On f. 2 is written ‘The Ladie Isabell Fairfax daughter and hare of
7573,THIRD RECENSION.,"Thwats hir bouk,’ on f. 8 ‘This boke belongeth to my lady farfax off"
7574,THIRD RECENSION.,"Steton,’ and on f. 1 ‘S^r Thomas fayrfax of Denton Knighte true owner"
7575,THIRD RECENSION.,"of this booke, 1588.’ This Lady Isabell Fairfax was the granddaughter"
7576,THIRD RECENSION.,"and heiress of John Thwaites of Denton, who died in 1511, and was"
7577,THIRD RECENSION.,married to Sir William Fairfax of Steeton. Sir Thomas Fairfax of
7578,THIRD RECENSION.,"Denton, whose name appears in the book, was her grandson. The book no"
7579,THIRD RECENSION.,"doubt came from the Thwaites family, and we are thus able to trace"
7580,THIRD RECENSION.,"it back as far as John Thwaites of Denton, who died in old age not"
7581,THIRD RECENSION.,much more than a hundred years after the death of the author. It was
7582,THIRD RECENSION.,bequeathed with other MSS. to the University of Oxford by Sir Thomas
7583,THIRD RECENSION.,"Fairfax the parliamentary general, grandson of the above Sir Thomas"
7584,THIRD RECENSION.,"Fairfax of Denton, and was placed in the Bodleian Library in 1675."
7585,THIRD RECENSION.,
7586,THIRD RECENSION.,"The first leaf of the text, up to Prol. 146, is written in a"
7587,THIRD RECENSION.,"second hand which has also written ff. 186-194, including the"
7588,THIRD RECENSION.,last lines of the _Conf. Amantis_ from viii. 3147. A third hand
7589,THIRD RECENSION.,"(with very different orthography) has written viii. 2938-3146,"
7590,THIRD RECENSION.,being the last 29 lines of f. 41 v^o (over an erasure) and
7591,THIRD RECENSION.,"the whole of f. 185, which is a leaf inserted in the place"
7592,THIRD RECENSION.,of one cut away (the last of quire 23). At viii. 2938 there
7593,THIRD RECENSION.,"is visible a note, ‘now haue, etc.,’ for the guidance of the"
7594,THIRD RECENSION.,scribe after the erasure had been made. From the fact that two
7595,THIRD RECENSION.,hands have been employed in the transformation of the MS. at
7596,THIRD RECENSION.,the beginning and end it seems probable that the changes were
7597,THIRD RECENSION.,made at two separate times (as we also know by the dates that
7598,THIRD RECENSION.,"the rewritten epilogue preceded the rewritten preface), and"
7599,THIRD RECENSION.,that what I have called the third hand was really the second
7600,THIRD RECENSION.,"in order of time, being employed to substitute the later"
7601,THIRD RECENSION.,"epilogue for the former, while the other hand, doing its work"
7602,THIRD RECENSION.,"probably after the accession of Henry IV, replaced the first"
7603,THIRD RECENSION.,"leaf by one containing the Lancaster dedication, which had"
7604,THIRD RECENSION.,"been in existence since 1392-3, but perhaps only in private"
7605,THIRD RECENSION.,"circulation, and added also the _Traitié_ and the Latin poems,"
7606,THIRD RECENSION.,"with the account of the author’s books, ‘Quia vnusquisque,’"
7607,THIRD RECENSION.,"in its revised form. I say after the accession of Henry IV,"
7608,THIRD RECENSION.,because the reference in the third recension account of the
7609,THIRD RECENSION.,"books to Richard’s fall, ‘ab alto corruens in foueam quam"
7610,THIRD RECENSION.,"fecit finaliter proiectus est,’ seems to require as late a"
7611,THIRD RECENSION.,date as this. It should be noted that this hand is the same
7612,THIRD RECENSION.,as that which has made somewhat similar additions to the All
7613,THIRD RECENSION.,Souls and Glasgow MSS. of the _Vox Clamantis_. Other examples
7614,THIRD RECENSION.,of alteration of first recension readings by erasure in F are
7615,THIRD RECENSION.,"Prol. 331 _marg._, 336, i. 2713 f., iv. 1321 f., 1361 f., _Lat."
7616,THIRD RECENSION.,"Verses after_ vii. 1640, _Lat. Verses after_ vii. 1984."
7617,THIRD RECENSION.,
7618,THIRD RECENSION.,As this edition prints the text of the Fairfax MS. and its
7619,THIRD RECENSION.,"relations have already been discussed, little more need be"
7620,THIRD RECENSION.,said here except as to the manner in which the text is dealt
7621,THIRD RECENSION.,with in the printing. It should be noted then that _i_ and
7622,THIRD RECENSION.,"_j_, _u_ and _v_ are used in accordance with modern practice,"
7623,THIRD RECENSION.,"that no distinction is made between the two forms of _s_,"
7624,THIRD RECENSION.,"that _th_ is used for _þ_, and _y_ for _ȝ_ in _ȝe_, _ȝit_,"
7625,THIRD RECENSION.,"_ȝiue_, _aȝein_, _beȝete_, &c. (this last rather against my"
7626,THIRD RECENSION.,"judgement, for no good MS. has it). It should be observed also"
7627,THIRD RECENSION.,that the Fairfax scribe frequently uses _v_ for _u_ at the
7628,THIRD RECENSION.,"end of a word, as ‘nov,’ ‘hov’ (often ‘hou’), ‘þov’ (usually"
7629,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘þou’), ‘ȝov’ (also ‘ȝou’), ‘auov,’ ‘windov,’ ‘blev,’ ‘knev,’"
7630,THIRD RECENSION.,"&c., and sometimes in other positions, either for the sake"
7631,THIRD RECENSION.,"of distinction from _n_ or merely for ornament, as ‘comvne,’"
7632,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘retenve,’ ‘rvnne,’ ‘þvrgh,’ ‘havk,’ ‘fovl,’ ‘hovndes,’ ‘movþ,’"
7633,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘rovnede,’ ‘slovh,’ ‘trovþe,’ ‘ynovh,’ &c., beside ‘comune,’"
7634,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘runne,’ ‘þurgh,’ ‘hauk,’ ‘foul,’ &c. In all these cases _v_ is"
7635,THIRD RECENSION.,given in the text as _u_. The termination ‘-o̅n̅’ is regularly
7636,THIRD RECENSION.,printed as ‘-oun.’ French words with this ending appear in F
7637,THIRD RECENSION.,"with -o̅u̅ or -o̅n̅, usually the latter (but ‘resoun’ in full,"
7638,THIRD RECENSION.,"Prol. 151), and sometimes we have ‘to̅n̅’ for ‘toun,’ as vii."
7639,THIRD RECENSION.,"5313, viii. 2523. So also ‘sto̅n̅de : wounde,’ i. 1425 f.,"
7640,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘gro̅n̅de’ for ‘grounde,’ i. 2051, ‘expo̅n̅de : founde,’ i. 2867"
7641,THIRD RECENSION.,"f., ‘bra̅n̅che : staunche,’ i. 2837 f., ‘cha̅n̅ce,’ i. 3203,"
7642,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘gra̅n̅teþ,’ ii. 1463, ‘suppla̅n̅te,’ ii. 2369, ‘skla̅n̅dre,’"
7643,THIRD RECENSION.,"v. 5536 (‘sclaundre,’ v. 712), ‘coma̅n̅de : launde,’ vii. 2159."
7644,THIRD RECENSION.,
7645,THIRD RECENSION.,The contraction ꝑ as a separate word is in this edition almost
7646,THIRD RECENSION.,"regularly given as ‘per.’ It is hardly ever written fully in F,"
7647,THIRD RECENSION.,"but we have ‘Per aunter,’ v. 3351, ‘Per cha_u_nce,’ v. 7816,"
7648,THIRD RECENSION.,"and J regularly gives ‘per chance,’ ‘per cas,’ &c., without"
7649,THIRD RECENSION.,"contraction. Other MSS., as A and B, incline rather to ‘par.’ F"
7650,THIRD RECENSION.,"has ‘perceive,’ ‘aperceive,’ but ‘parfit.’"
7651,THIRD RECENSION.,
7652,THIRD RECENSION.,"With regard to the use of capitals, this edition in the main"
7653,THIRD RECENSION.,"follows the MS. Some letters, however, as _k_, _v_, _w_, _y_,"
7654,THIRD RECENSION.,"can hardly be said to have any difference of form, and others"
7655,THIRD RECENSION.,"are used rather rarely as capitals, while in the case of some,"
7656,THIRD RECENSION.,"and especially _s_, the capital form is used with excessive"
7657,THIRD RECENSION.,freedom. It has seemed desirable therefore to introduce a
7658,THIRD RECENSION.,"greater degree of consistency, while preserving the general"
7659,THIRD RECENSION.,usage of the MS. Proper names are regularly given in this
7660,THIRD RECENSION.,"edition with capitals (usually so in the MS., but not always),"
7661,THIRD RECENSION.,and sentences are begun with capital letters after a full stop.
7662,THIRD RECENSION.,"On the other hand the _I_ (or _J_), which is often used as"
7663,THIRD RECENSION.,"an initial, has frequently been suppressed, and occasionally"
7664,THIRD RECENSION.,this has been done in the case of other letters. It may be
7665,THIRD RECENSION.,"observed, however, that capital letters are on the whole used"
7666,THIRD RECENSION.,"very systematically in the MS., and other good MSS., especially"
7667,THIRD RECENSION.,"S, agree with F in the main principles. Certain substantives as"
7668,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘Ere,’ ‘Erthe,’ ‘Schip,’ ‘Sone,’ ‘Ston,’ are almost invariably"
7669,THIRD RECENSION.,"used with capitals, and names of animals, as ‘Cat,’ ‘Hare,’"
7670,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘Hound,’ ‘Leoun,’ ‘Mous,’ ‘Oxe,’ ‘Pie,’ ‘Ro,’ ‘Schep,’ ‘Tigre,’"
7671,THIRD RECENSION.,"of some parts of the body, as ‘Arm,’ ‘Hiele,’ ‘Lippes,’ ‘Nase,’"
7672,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘Pappes,’ ‘Skulle,’ and many other concrete substantives,"
7673,THIRD RECENSION.,"are apt to be written with capitals, sometimes apparently in"
7674,THIRD RECENSION.,order to give them more importance. Capitals are seldom thus
7675,THIRD RECENSION.,"used except in the case of substantives and some numerals, as"
7676,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘Nyne,’ ‘Seconde,’ ‘Sexte,’ ‘Tenthe,’ and in many cases it is"
7677,THIRD RECENSION.,"pretty evident that a distinction is intended, e.g. between"
7678,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘Sone’ and ‘sone’ (adv.), ‘Se’ (= sea) and ‘se’ (verb), ‘Dore’"
7679,THIRD RECENSION.,"and ‘dore’ (verb), see iv. 2825 f., ‘More’ and ‘more,’ ‘Pype’"
7680,THIRD RECENSION.,"and ‘pipe’ (verb), iv. 3342 f., ‘Myn’ and ‘myn’ (poss. pron.),"
7681,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘Mone’ and ‘mone’ (verb), but see v. 5804, 5808, ‘In’ and ‘in,’"
7682,THIRD RECENSION.,"vii. 4921 f., viii. 1169 f., 1285 f. That some importance was"
7683,THIRD RECENSION.,attached to the matter is shown by the cases where careful
7684,THIRD RECENSION.,alterations of small letters into capitals have been made in
7685,THIRD RECENSION.,"the MS., as Prol. 949, i. 1687, v. 1435, 3206, 4019, vii. 2785,"
7686,THIRD RECENSION.,&c.
7687,THIRD RECENSION.,
7688,THIRD RECENSION.,"Many corrections were made by the first hand, and some of these"
7689,THIRD RECENSION.,"are noteworthy, especially the cases where a final _e_ seems to"
7690,THIRD RECENSION.,be deliberately erased for the sake of the metre or before a
7691,THIRD RECENSION.,"vowel, as i. 60 ‘get’ for ‘gete,’ iii. 2346 ‘trew’ for ‘trewe,’"
7692,THIRD RECENSION.,"vi. 1359 ‘I red’ for ‘I rede,’ vii. 1706 ‘ffyf’ for ‘ffyue,’"
7693,THIRD RECENSION.,"or where an _e_ has been added afterwards, as ii. 3399 ‘deþe,’"
7694,THIRD RECENSION.,"iii. 449 ‘bowe,’ v. 1269, 3726, 5265, ‘whiche.’"
7695,THIRD RECENSION.,
7696,THIRD RECENSION.,"It remains only to speak of the punctuation of the MS., which"
7697,THIRD RECENSION.,is evidently carried out carefully. The frequent stops at the
7698,THIRD RECENSION.,"ends of lines are for the most part meaningless, but those"
7699,THIRD RECENSION.,elsewhere are of importance and usually may be taken as a guide
7700,THIRD RECENSION.,to the sense. They are sometimes certainly wrong (e.g. i. 1102
7701,THIRD RECENSION.,Togedre· 1284 will· 2965 fro· ii. 1104 wille· 1397 name· 2354
7702,THIRD RECENSION.,astat· iii. 2638 be· iv. 497 grace· 1751 besinesse· 1985 hardi·
7703,THIRD RECENSION.,2502 alle· 3354 Slep· 3635 lif· v. 4 good· 231 herte· 444 wynd·
7704,THIRD RECENSION.,"1342 See· 1630 only· 2318 bord· &c.), but the proportion of"
7705,THIRD RECENSION.,"error is small, and the punctuation of F generally must be"
7706,THIRD RECENSION.,treated with respect. There is usually a stop wherever a marked
7707,THIRD RECENSION.,"pause comes in the line, and this punctuation occurs on an"
7708,THIRD RECENSION.,average about once in ten lines. The following record of the
7709,THIRD RECENSION.,punctuation of iv. 1301-1600 will serve as an illustration of
7710,THIRD RECENSION.,its nature and extent: 1303 loue· 1307 ladis· 1316 cloþed· 1369

7766,THIRD RECENSION.,"This book seems to be derived from F, though perhaps not"

7829,THIRD RECENSION.,
7830,THIRD RECENSION.,The various hands differ very much from one another in
7831,THIRD RECENSION.,correctness. The first and the fourth give a text so closely
7832,THIRD RECENSION.,"corresponding to that of F, that it is almost impossible not"
7833,THIRD RECENSION.,to believe that it is copied from it. In the case of some
7834,THIRD RECENSION.,of the other hands this exact correspondence in details of
7835,THIRD RECENSION.,"spelling and punctuation disappears, and a much less correct"
7836,THIRD RECENSION.,"text is given, but this seems chiefly due to carelessness (the"
7837,THIRD RECENSION.,"third hand, for example, is evidently inaccurate and much"
7838,THIRD RECENSION.,neglects the metre). At the same time it must be noted that K
7839,THIRD RECENSION.,"has the marginal note at the beginning of the Prologue, which"
7840,THIRD RECENSION.,"is wanting in F, ‘Hic in principio,’ &c., and there are some"
7841,THIRD RECENSION.,"readings which seem to be derived from another source, as iii."
7842,THIRD RECENSION.,"778, 906, 921, 1732, 1832 (all in the seventh quire), where"
7843,THIRD RECENSION.,there is agreement with AM. On the whole the question of the
7844,THIRD RECENSION.,dependence of K upon F must be left doubtful.
7845,THIRD RECENSION.,
7846,THIRD RECENSION.,We can trace to this MS. a good many of the mistakes which
7847,THIRD RECENSION.,"appear in H₃ and the Magdalen MS., and found their way"
7848,THIRD RECENSION.,"sometimes thus into printed editions, e.g. Prol. 160 bothe,"
7849,THIRD RECENSION.,"260 to make manhode, i. 3170 _om._ his, ii. 78 fader, 101 hem"

7851,THIRD RECENSION.,(_originally_ The). The cause of the great increase of error
7852,THIRD RECENSION.,about the beginning of the second book is the appearance on
7853,THIRD RECENSION.,"the scene of the careless third hand, which on f. 40 (for"
7854,THIRD RECENSION.,example) in its last ten lines has at least twenty variations
7855,THIRD RECENSION.,"in spelling, &c., from the text of F, while the first hand"
7856,THIRD RECENSION.,resuming has not a single one in its first eighteen lines.
7857,THIRD RECENSION.,"Indeed, whole columns may be found in the parts copied by the"
7858,THIRD RECENSION.,first or the fourth hand which do not differ from F in the

7877,THIRD RECENSION.,On the first page ‘Oxford B. H.’
7878,THIRD RECENSION.,
7879,THIRD RECENSION.,"This is a very large and magnificent volume, written on fine"
7880,THIRD RECENSION.,"parchment, doubtless for some distinguished person. The text,"
7881,THIRD RECENSION.,"however, is late and not very good. It is almost certain that"
7882,THIRD RECENSION.,it is derived ultimately from the Keswick MS. The evidence of
7883,THIRD RECENSION.,this is as follows: (1) Mistakes made in that MS. are nearly
7884,THIRD RECENSION.,regularly reproduced in H₃. Some instances have been referred
7885,THIRD RECENSION.,to in the account of K: we may add here that where K omits
7886,THIRD RECENSION.,"the Latin summaries in a part of the seventh book, e.g. vii."
7887,THIRD RECENSION.,"1641-1884, 1917-2765, H₃ does the same, and where variants"
7888,THIRD RECENSION.,"apparently from the AM group appear in K, as iii. 778, 906,"
7889,THIRD RECENSION.,"921, 1732, they are found also in H₃. (2) The inequality which"
7890,THIRD RECENSION.,"is to be observed in the text of H₃, some parts being much"
7891,THIRD RECENSION.,"less correct than others, corresponds in the main with the"
7892,THIRD RECENSION.,difference of hands in K. Thus we find that a great crop of
7893,THIRD RECENSION.,error springs up in H₃ from the point where the third hand
7894,THIRD RECENSION.,"of K begins, the preceding portion of the text being very"
7895,THIRD RECENSION.,"fairly correct, and so to some extent elsewhere. For example,"
7896,THIRD RECENSION.,in v. 917-1017 (a part written in K by the first hand) there
7897,THIRD RECENSION.,"are about eight metrical faults in a hundred lines, while in"
7898,THIRD RECENSION.,"vi. 183-283 (written in K by the third hand), there are at"
7899,THIRD RECENSION.,least twenty-five. (3) In a certain part of the third book
7900,THIRD RECENSION.,"H₃ suddenly ceases to follow the third recension text, and"
7901,THIRD RECENSION.,almost regularly gives the readings of the ERCLB₂ group. This
7902,THIRD RECENSION.,appears first in iii. 1088 and ceases to be the case after iii.
7903,THIRD RECENSION.,"1686, thus remarkably corresponding with the gap caused in K"
7904,THIRD RECENSION.,by the loss of three leaves after iii. 1086. It is difficult
7905,THIRD RECENSION.,not to believe that this very marked change was caused by the
7906,THIRD RECENSION.,following of another MS. in a place where K was defective.

7929,THIRD RECENSION.,and dismissed from that office as ‘insufficiens’ in Dec. 1611. The book
7930,THIRD RECENSION.,is reported missing in Coxe’s catalogue.
7931,THIRD RECENSION.,
7932,THIRD RECENSION.,"This MS. is in many points like H₃ in its text, and must"
7933,THIRD RECENSION.,"certainly have the same origin, both being perhaps derived from"
7934,THIRD RECENSION.,a MS. dependent on K. It reproduces most of the corruptions
7935,THIRD RECENSION.,"which we find in H₃, adding many others of its own, and it has"
7936,THIRD RECENSION.,the same readings in the third book which we have already noted
7937,THIRD RECENSION.,in H₃.
7938,THIRD RECENSION.,
7939,THIRD RECENSION.,A point of interest about this MS. is its apparent connexion
7940,THIRD RECENSION.,with Caxton’s edition. It seems evident that among the MSS.
7941,THIRD RECENSION.,from which Caxton worked (and he had three at least) was
7942,THIRD RECENSION.,either this very copy or one so like it as to be practically
7943,THIRD RECENSION.,undistinguishable. Of this we shall say more when we speak of
7944,THIRD RECENSION.,Caxton’s edition.
7945,THIRD RECENSION.,
7946,THIRD RECENSION.,"W. WADHAM COLL., OXF. 13. _Confessio Amantis_ with ‘Explicit’ (six"
7947,THIRD RECENSION.,"lines) and ‘Quam cinxere,’ then the _Traitié_, slightly imperfect at"
7948,THIRD RECENSION.,"the end, ending ‘un amie soulain,’ xvii. 9. Paper, ff. 450, including"
7949,THIRD RECENSION.,"two original blanks at the beginning, 11½ × 8¼ in., in quires of"
7950,THIRD RECENSION.,8 with catchwords: written in column of 30-48 lines (without ruling) in
7951,THIRD RECENSION.,"two hands, of which the first wrote up to iv. 2132, and the other from"
7952,THIRD RECENSION.,"thence to the end. Latin summaries in margin, but sometimes omitted or"
7953,THIRD RECENSION.,cut short. Some decoration of the first page of the text in black and
7954,THIRD RECENSION.,"red; capitals, titles, &c. in red."
7955,THIRD RECENSION.,
7956,THIRD RECENSION.,"Three leaves are lost in the _Conf. Amantis_, containing Prol. 728-794,"
7957,THIRD RECENSION.,"iv. 2386-2473, and v. 1-78, and several also at the end of the volume."
7958,THIRD RECENSION.,"There is great confusion in the text of the Prologue, which goes as"
7959,THIRD RECENSION.,"follows: 1-92, 499-860 (with loss as above), 93-144, 861-1044, 145-498,"
7960,THIRD RECENSION.,and then 1045 ff. This is not produced by any disarrangement of leaves
7961,THIRD RECENSION.,"in the present MS., but a considerable dislocation of quires has taken"
7962,THIRD RECENSION.,"place in a later part of the volume, seven quires of the fourth and"
7963,THIRD RECENSION.,fifth books having been taken out of their proper place and bound up
7964,THIRD RECENSION.,between vi. 2132 and 2133.
7965,THIRD RECENSION.,
7966,THIRD RECENSION.,"This book was evidently written for one John Dedwood, since his name"
7967,THIRD RECENSION.,"and device, a piece of the trunk of a dead tree, occur as part of"
7968,THIRD RECENSION.,the decorations of the first page. The two blanks at the beginning
7969,THIRD RECENSION.,are written over with a list of Mayors and Sheriffs for a series of
7970,THIRD RECENSION.,"years, and these prove to be those of the city of Chester from the year"
7971,THIRD RECENSION.,"1469-1499 (see Ormerod’s _Hist. of Cheshire_, i. 211 f.). The name of"
7972,THIRD RECENSION.,John Dedwood occurs among these as Sheriff in the year 1481 and as
7973,THIRD RECENSION.,Mayor in 1483 (but the record in the MS. is here damaged). He had also
7974,THIRD RECENSION.,been Mayor in 1468. We may therefore suppose that the MS. dates from
7975,THIRD RECENSION.,about 1470. The name Troutbecke occurs several times (with other names)
7976,THIRD RECENSION.,"in the book, and later (1765) it belonged to Rich. Warner of Woodford"
7977,THIRD RECENSION.,"Row, Essex."
7978,THIRD RECENSION.,
7979,THIRD RECENSION.,"The first hand of this MS. is cramped and ugly, varying a good"
7980,THIRD RECENSION.,"deal in size, the second is neat and uniform. The text is late"
7981,THIRD RECENSION.,"and full of mistakes, and the spelling bad, even such forms"
7982,THIRD RECENSION.,"as ‘loves,’ ‘beres,’ ‘gos’ being quite common for ‘loveth,’"
7983,THIRD RECENSION.,"&c., and often _-et_ or _-ut_ as a participle termination,"
7984,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘despeyret,’ ‘resignet,’ ‘weddut,’ ‘cleput,’ &c. A certain"
7985,THIRD RECENSION.,interest attaches to the MS. however from the fact that it
7986,THIRD RECENSION.,seems to be clearly independent of F as well as of the KH₃
7987,THIRD RECENSION.,"group. While agreeing with F completely in form of text, and"
7988,THIRD RECENSION.,"supporting it also as a rule against the mistakes of KH₃, it"
7989,THIRD RECENSION.,has a considerable number of readings which belong to the
7990,THIRD RECENSION.,"first recension uncorrected type, and in other cases it agrees"
7991,THIRD RECENSION.,specially with B. Instances of the former are to be found
7992,THIRD RECENSION.,"in Prol. 159, i. 8, 1839, 2423, 2801, 3027, ii. 961, 1200,"
7993,THIRD RECENSION.,"1441, 3306, 3516, iii. 68, 626, 2056, v. 1698, 2500, 3376,"
7994,THIRD RECENSION.,"vi. 543, 1151, 1631, vii. 1490, _Latin verses after_ 1640 and"
7995,THIRD RECENSION.,"1984, 5104, viii. 510, 2342, 2925, &c. These, with others of"
7996,THIRD RECENSION.,"a similar kind, scattered through the whole book, seem to be"
7997,THIRD RECENSION.,"of the nature of accidental survivals, a first recension copy"
7998,THIRD RECENSION.,(the remote ancestor of W) having been altered by collation
7999,THIRD RECENSION.,with one resembling F. W agrees with apparent mistakes of F and
8000,THIRD RECENSION.,"the rest of the third recension in some passages, as iii. 446,"
8001,THIRD RECENSION.,"iv. 2867, 2973, vii. 5135, viii. 1069, 1999, but supports what"
8002,THIRD RECENSION.,"is apparently the true reading against them in Prol. 1078, i."
8003,THIRD RECENSION.,"1068, ii. 2299, 2537, iii. 1605, v. 2906, &c. In most of these"
8004,THIRD RECENSION.,last instances W merely remains in agreement with the first
8005,THIRD RECENSION.,"recension, where F, &c. depart from it, therefore its testimony"
8006,THIRD RECENSION.,may be of an accidental character.
8007,THIRD RECENSION.,
8008,THIRD RECENSION.,The list of Mayors and Sheriffs of Chester on the first pages has
8009,THIRD RECENSION.,"perhaps some local interest, as it is contemporary and probably"
8010,THIRD RECENSION.,made by a responsible person. Comparing it with that given in
8011,THIRD RECENSION.,"Ormerod’s _Hist. of Cheshire_, we find several differences, as"
8012,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘Ric. Sadler’ for ‘Rich. Smith’ as one of the Sheriffs of 1475,"
8013,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘John Monkesfelde, Rob. Pleche,’ Sheriffs for 1478, ‘Mathewe"
8014,THIRD RECENSION.,"Hewse’ for ‘Mathew Johnson,’ 1479, ‘Rychard Kir e’ for ‘Rich."
8015,THIRD RECENSION.,"Barker,’ 1492. The same pages have some notes about current"
8016,THIRD RECENSION.,"historical events, as (under 1469), ‘The which yere were hedet"
8017,THIRD RECENSION.,the lorde Wellybe and the lorde Well. his son for the grete
8018,THIRD RECENSION.,insurreccion and rysing of the Comyns of the Counte of Lyncolne.
8019,THIRD RECENSION.,Also the same yere entred our Souereyne and moste noble Prince
8020,THIRD RECENSION.,"Kynge Edward now reynynge,’ &c. Under 1470 is a note of the"
8021,THIRD RECENSION.,"battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury, and at 1476 the record of a"
8022,THIRD RECENSION.,"visit to Chester of ‘our Souereigne lorde Prince,’ who stayed"

8096,THIRD RECENSION.,
8097,THIRD RECENSION.,Nine good miniatures cut out of a MS. of the _Conf. Amantis_ are in
8098,THIRD RECENSION.,"the possession of Mr. A. H. Frere, who kindly allowed me to see them."
8099,THIRD RECENSION.,"They are as follows. (1) Tereus, (2) Codrus, (3) Socrates and his wife,"
8100,THIRD RECENSION.,"(4) Dives and Lazarus, (5) Roman Triumph, (6) Ulysses and Telegonus,"
8101,THIRD RECENSION.,"(7) The Three Questions, (8) Lycurgus taking an oath from the Athenians"
8102,THIRD RECENSION.,"(?), (9) King on a quay with bales and gold vessels, apparently landed"
8103,THIRD RECENSION.,"from a ship near, perhaps Apollonius landing at Tarsis. Several of"
8104,THIRD RECENSION.,"the pictures represent more than one scene of the story, as that of"
8105,THIRD RECENSION.,"Tereus, in which we have the king at meat presented with the head of"
8106,THIRD RECENSION.,"his son, while there are three birds in the background and the scene of"
8107,THIRD RECENSION.,"the outrage on Philomene on the left; and again in (4), where the rich"
8108,THIRD RECENSION.,"man and his wife are sitting at table and refusing food to the beggar,"
8109,THIRD RECENSION.,while in the background on the right an angel is receiving the soul of
8110,THIRD RECENSION.,the dying Lazarus.
8111,THIRD RECENSION.,
8112,THIRD RECENSION.,"These miniatures are supposed to have belonged to Sir John Fenn, editor"
8113,THIRD RECENSION.,of the Paston Letters. The MS. from which they were cut seems to have
8114,THIRD RECENSION.,been of the middle of the fifteenth cent.
8115,THIRD RECENSION.,
8116,THIRD RECENSION.,Evidence is afforded of one other large and well written MS. of the
8117,THIRD RECENSION.,_Conf. Amantis_ by a fragment of parchment in the Shrewsbury School
8118,THIRD RECENSION.,"Library, of which a photograph has most kindly been sent to me by Dr."
8119,THIRD RECENSION.,"Calvert of Shrewsbury. It contains about 70 lines of the Prologue, viz."
8120,THIRD RECENSION.,"189-195 (with the Latin), 224-244, 274-294, 323-343. The leaf to which"
8121,THIRD RECENSION.,"it belonged must have measured at least 15½ × 11½ in., and was"
8122,THIRD RECENSION.,written in double column of 50 lines.
8123,THIRD RECENSION.,
8124,THIRD RECENSION.,Three other MSS. are mentioned in the Catalogue of 1697 (vol. ii. pt.
8125,THIRD RECENSION.,"1), viz. 611 ‘John Gower’s Old English Poems’ with ‘S. Anselmi Speculum"
8126,THIRD RECENSION.,"Religiosorum,’ at Naworth Castle, which I strongly suspect is identical"
8127,THIRD RECENSION.,"with Harl. 3490 (H₁), 4035, ‘Goweri Confessio Amantis, Fol. magn.,’"
8128,THIRD RECENSION.,"belonging to Ric. Brideoake, Esq., of Ledwell, Oxon., and 6974, ‘Jo."
8129,THIRD RECENSION.,"Gower’s Poems, fol.,’ belonging to Sir Henry Langley of the County of"
8130,THIRD RECENSION.,"Salop (i.e. of the Abbey, Shrewsbury)."
8131,THIRD RECENSION.,
8132,THIRD RECENSION.,"The average excellence of the Gower MSS. stands high, and there"
8133,THIRD RECENSION.,is a surprisingly large proportion of well written and finely
8134,THIRD RECENSION.,"decorated copies, which attain to more than a respectable standard of"
8135,THIRD RECENSION.,"correctness. Manuscripts such as L or B₂, which stand in the third rank"
8136,THIRD RECENSION.,"among copies of the _Confessio Amantis_, would take a very different"
8137,THIRD RECENSION.,"place among the authorities for any of Chaucer’s works, second only to"
8138,THIRD RECENSION.,"the Ellesmere MS. if they were copies of the _Canterbury Tales_, and"
8139,THIRD RECENSION.,easily in the first place if it were a question of the _Legend of Good
8140,THIRD RECENSION.,Women_ or the _Hous of Fame_. It is evident not only that Gower was
8141,THIRD RECENSION.,"careful about the text of his writings, but also that there was some"
8142,THIRD RECENSION.,"organized system of reproduction, which was wanting in the case of"
8143,THIRD RECENSION.,Chaucer.
8144,THIRD RECENSION.,
8145,THIRD RECENSION.,VERSION. It remains to say something of the Spanish prose version of
8146,THIRD RECENSION.,"the _Confessio Amantis_, which exists in manuscript in the Library of"
8147,THIRD RECENSION.,the Escorial (g. ii. 19). Information about this was first given me by
8148,THIRD RECENSION.,"Mr. J. Fitzmaurice-Kelly, and since then by the learned Librarian of"
8149,THIRD RECENSION.,"the Escorial, Fr. Guillermo Antolin, O.S.A., who most obligingly sent"
8150,THIRD RECENSION.,me an account of it. The Catalogue (1858) thus describes the book:
8151,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘Confision del amante, libro así intitulado compuesto por Juan Goer"
8152,THIRD RECENSION.,"natural del Reyno de Englaterra, e tornado en lengua Portuguesa por"
8153,THIRD RECENSION.,"Roberto Payn ó Payna canónigo de la ciudad de Lisboa, e despues fué"
8154,THIRD RECENSION.,puesto en lenguaje castellano por Juan de Cuenca natural de Huete. Cod.
8155,THIRD RECENSION.,"escrito en papel el año de 1400, fol. menor. pasta.’ The statement"
8156,THIRD RECENSION.,about the author and the translators is taken from the beginning of the
8157,THIRD RECENSION.,translation itself. It seems to be rather implied that the Castilian
8158,THIRD RECENSION.,version made by Juan de Cuenca was based upon the Portuguese of Robert
8159,THIRD RECENSION.,"Payn, no doubt an Englishman. The present Librarian adds that it is a"
8160,THIRD RECENSION.,"book of 411 leaves, and of the end of the fourteenth or beginning of"
8161,THIRD RECENSION.,the fifteenth cent.
8162,THIRD RECENSION.,
8163,THIRD RECENSION.,The translation was made from a copy of the first recension. So far
8164,THIRD RECENSION.,as I can judge by the extracts with which the Librarian has furnished
8165,THIRD RECENSION.,"me, it is a tolerably close version. For example, Prol. 22 ff. ‘e"
8166,THIRD RECENSION.,por que pocos escriven en lenguaje yngles yo entiendo de componer
8167,THIRD RECENSION.,en el un lybro a onrra del Rey rricardo cuyo sugebto yo so en todo

8172,THIRD RECENSION.,"luego como me vido mando que fuese a una barca en que el venia, y"
8173,THIRD RECENSION.,"entre otras cosas que me dixo,’ &c. And again viii. 2941 ff. (the"
8174,THIRD RECENSION.,"Chaucer greeting), ‘Saluda de mi parte a caucer mi disciplo e mi poeta,"
8175,THIRD RECENSION.,"quando con el topares, el qual por mi en la su mancibia fiso toda su"
8176,THIRD RECENSION.,diligencia para componer y escreuir desyres e cantares de diversas
8177,THIRD RECENSION.,"maneras de los quales toda la tierra es llena, por la qual cosa en"
8178,THIRD RECENSION.,especial le soy mucho tenido mas que a ninguno de los otros. Por ende
8179,THIRD RECENSION.,dile que le enbio desir que tal esta en su postrimera hedad por dar fyn
8180,THIRD RECENSION.,"a todas sus obras se travaje de faser su testamento de amor, asi como"
8181,THIRD RECENSION.,tu has fecho agora en tu confision.’
8182,THIRD RECENSION.,
8183,THIRD RECENSION.,
8184,THIRD RECENSION.,"EDITIONS. The _Confessio Amantis_ has been already six times printed,"
8185,THIRD RECENSION.,"viz. by Caxton, by Berthelette (twice), in Chalmers’ English Poets, by"
8186,THIRD RECENSION.,"Pauli, and by Prof. Henry Morley. All the later editions are dependent,"
8187,THIRD RECENSION.,"directly or indirectly, on Berthelette."
8188,THIRD RECENSION.,
8189,THIRD RECENSION.,
8190,THIRD RECENSION.,CAXTON printed the _Conf. Amantis_ in 1483. His text is a composite
8191,THIRD RECENSION.,"one, taken from at least three MSS. At first he follows a copy of the"
8192,THIRD RECENSION.,"third recension, either the Magdalen MS. itself or one remarkably"
8193,THIRD RECENSION.,"like it, and he continues this for more than half the book, up to"
8194,THIRD RECENSION.,about v. 4500. Then for a time he seems to follow a second recension
8195,THIRD RECENSION.,"copy, either alone or in combination with the other, but from about"
8196,THIRD RECENSION.,v. 6400 to the end he prints from a manuscript of the unrevised first
8197,THIRD RECENSION.,"recension, inserting however the additional passages in the seventh"
8198,THIRD RECENSION.,book and the conclusion (after the Chaucer greeting) from one of his
8199,THIRD RECENSION.,other MSS. The account of the books ‘Quia vnusquisque’ at the end is
8200,THIRD RECENSION.,"from a first recension MS. The principle, no doubt, was to include as"
8201,THIRD RECENSION.,"much as possible, but two of the additional passages, v. 7015*-7036*"
8202,THIRD RECENSION.,"and 7086*-7210*, were omitted, probably by oversight, while a first"
8203,THIRD RECENSION.,recension copy was being followed. The later form of epilogue was
8204,THIRD RECENSION.,perhaps printed rather than the other because it is longer. Caxton
8205,THIRD RECENSION.,"prints the lines at the end of the Prologue, which are given only by"
8206,THIRD RECENSION.,"Δ, and there are some other indications that he had a MS. of this"
8207,THIRD RECENSION.,"type; but he had also one of the AdBT group, which alone contain vii."
8208,THIRD RECENSION.,2329*-2340* and 3149*-3180*.
8209,THIRD RECENSION.,
8210,THIRD RECENSION.,"On f. cxvi v^o Caxton still agrees with Magd. almost regularly,"
8211,THIRD RECENSION.,e.g. v. 4450 And myn hap 4454 is not trouble 4465 But for that
8212,THIRD RECENSION.,"4467 ne shall yeue and lene 4484 doo 4503 A good word, whereas"
8213,THIRD RECENSION.,"on f. cxvii he differs repeatedly, e.g. 4528, 4532, 4543, 4555,"
8214,THIRD RECENSION.,"4560, 4572, and seems never to be in full agreement after this."
8215,THIRD RECENSION.,That he is following a first recension copy after about v. 6400
8216,THIRD RECENSION.,is clear from the unbroken series of readings belonging to this
8217,THIRD RECENSION.,class which he exhibits. The text generally is very poor and
8218,THIRD RECENSION.,the metre extremely bad.
8219,THIRD RECENSION.,
8220,THIRD RECENSION.,
8221,THIRD RECENSION.,BERTHELETTE in 1532 printed the _Conf. Amantis_ from a MS. very closely
8222,THIRD RECENSION.,"resembling B. He did not venture, however, to substitute the preface"
8223,THIRD RECENSION.,"which he found in his copy for that to which Caxton had given currency,"
8224,THIRD RECENSION.,but merely expressed surprise that the printed copies should deviate so
8225,THIRD RECENSION.,"much from the MSS., and printed separately that which his manuscript"
8226,THIRD RECENSION.,"gave. He also takes from Caxton the lines at the end of the Prologue,"
8227,THIRD RECENSION.,"the additional third recension passages, Prol. 495-498, 579-584, i."
8228,THIRD RECENSION.,"1403-1406, 2267-2274, 2343-2358, 2369-2372[AK], and also the Chaucer"
8229,THIRD RECENSION.,"greeting, viii. 2941-2960*, but he has overlooked v. 7701-7746. He"
8230,THIRD RECENSION.,"inserts of course all the additional passages in v. and vii, as he"
8231,THIRD RECENSION.,"found them in his MS., loudly protesting against Caxton for omitting"
8232,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘lynes and columnes, ye and sometyme holle padges.’"
8233,THIRD RECENSION.,
8234,THIRD RECENSION.,"Berthelette’s text is better than Caxton’s, but his manuscript must"
8235,THIRD RECENSION.,have been decidedly inferior in correctness to B.
8236,THIRD RECENSION.,
8237,THIRD RECENSION.,"The second edition, 1554, is a reprint of the first, column for column,"
8238,THIRD RECENSION.,"in different type. A few mistakes are corrected, and the spelling is"
8239,THIRD RECENSION.,"somewhat changed, especially by substitution in many cases of _i_ for"
8240,THIRD RECENSION.,_y_.
8241,THIRD RECENSION.,
8242,THIRD RECENSION.,
8243,THIRD RECENSION.,CHALMERS published the _Conf. Amantis_ in vol. ii. of the collection of
8244,THIRD RECENSION.,"British Poets, 1810, taking the text from Berthelette’s edition of 1554."
8245,THIRD RECENSION.,
8246,THIRD RECENSION.,
8247,THIRD RECENSION.,PAULI professed to follow Berthelette’s first edition with collation
8248,THIRD RECENSION.,"throughout of MSS. Harl. 7184 and 3869, and occasional reference to"
8249,THIRD RECENSION.,Harl. 3490 and the Stafford MS. It is almost impossible that this full
8250,THIRD RECENSION.,"collation can really have been made, for by it nearly all Berthelette’s"
8251,THIRD RECENSION.,"errors might have been corrected, whereas we find them as a matter of"
8252,THIRD RECENSION.,fact on every page of Pauli’s edition. As to the critical judgement
8253,THIRD RECENSION.,"of the editor, it is enough to say that he regarded Harl. 7184 as a"
8254,THIRD RECENSION.,better authority for the text and spelling than either Harl. 3869
8255,THIRD RECENSION.,or the Stafford MS. (being attracted apparently by the external
8256,THIRD RECENSION.,"magnificence of the volume), and that he actually pronounced it to"
8257,THIRD RECENSION.,be of the fourteenth cent. His diligence may be measured by the fact
8258,THIRD RECENSION.,that because Harl. 3490 stops short at viii. 3062* (in the middle of
8259,THIRD RECENSION.,"a sentence), being left unfinished by the scribe, therefore Pauli’s"
8260,THIRD RECENSION.,"edition omits the remainder of this conclusion, 3063*-3114*[AL], though"
8261,THIRD RECENSION.,"he had the MS. in the Royal Library (R) within his reach, by means of"
8262,THIRD RECENSION.,which he might have completed his copy. He is also seriously inaccurate
8263,THIRD RECENSION.,in the statements which he makes about the Stafford MS. as regards the
8264,THIRD RECENSION.,additional passages.
8265,THIRD RECENSION.,
8266,THIRD RECENSION.,"A certain number of the errors in Berthelette’s edition are corrected,"
8267,THIRD RECENSION.,"but very many remain, and in some cases further corruption has been"
8268,THIRD RECENSION.,"introduced by the editor, either from Harl. 7184 or otherwise. The"
8269,THIRD RECENSION.,"orthography has been ‘restored,’ but hardly with success."
8270,THIRD RECENSION.,
8271,THIRD RECENSION.,
8272,THIRD RECENSION.,"MORLEY (1889) followed Pauli’s text, with conjectural alterations of"
8273,THIRD RECENSION.,"his own, and a few corrections from Berthelette, as i. 773. Often"
8274,THIRD RECENSION.,"the changes are quite wrong, e.g. Prol. 82, 608, i. 777, 1675 f.,"
8275,THIRD RECENSION.,"2957 f., the most extraordinary perhaps being iv. 2408 f. The editor"
8276,THIRD RECENSION.,professes to omit iii. 142-338 and a few lines here and there in other
8277,THIRD RECENSION.,"places. The omissions, however, are much more extensive than this"
8278,THIRD RECENSION.,"seems to imply. In the fourth book alone they are as follows, 401-408,"
8279,THIRD RECENSION.,"428-436, 443-506, 516-523, 1467-1475, 1490-1594, 2131-2182, 2754-2770,"
8280,THIRD RECENSION.,"2858-2862, 2883-2888, 3181-3302, and in some cases it is impossible"
8281,THIRD RECENSION.,even to conjecture on what principle they are made.
8282,THIRD RECENSION.,
8283,THIRD RECENSION.,
8284,THIRD RECENSION.,THE PRESENT EDITION. The text follows the Bodleian Fairfax MS.
8285,THIRD RECENSION.,and every deviation from this is noted. The critical apparatus is
8286,THIRD RECENSION.,constructed upon the following principles.
8287,THIRD RECENSION.,
8288,THIRD RECENSION.,Three manuscripts have been collated throughout with the text of
8289,THIRD RECENSION.,"F, viz. Bodley 902 (A), Corpus Christi Coll. 67 (C), and Bodley 294"
8290,THIRD RECENSION.,(B). These are selected to represent respectively the first recension
8291,THIRD RECENSION.,"revised, the first recension unrevised, and the second recension"
8292,THIRD RECENSION.,"texts. A is an excellent copy, the best of its class, C is a carefully"
8293,THIRD RECENSION.,"written MS., the best of the group to which it belongs, with the"
8294,THIRD RECENSION.,"exception of Egerton 1991, and B, besides being a good copy and almost"
8295,THIRD RECENSION.,"the only second recension MS. which is not imperfect, has perhaps"
8296,THIRD RECENSION.,a special claim to attention because its text is of the type which
8297,THIRD RECENSION.,all the editions except that of Caxton have followed. In all cases
8298,THIRD RECENSION.,"where variation has been found, except where it is merely of form and"
8299,THIRD RECENSION.,"spelling or of a very trifling and accidental kind, the readings of"
8300,THIRD RECENSION.,"at least fourteen other selected copies have been ascertained, and by"
8301,THIRD RECENSION.,this procedure those variations which are merely individual have been
8302,THIRD RECENSION.,distinguished from those which are shared by a class or a group. The
8303,THIRD RECENSION.,"result is given in the critical notes, all the variations of A and"
8304,THIRD RECENSION.,"B being there cited except those that are very trifling[AM], while"
8305,THIRD RECENSION.,the readings of C are usually given only when shared by some other
8306,THIRD RECENSION.,manuscript.
8307,THIRD RECENSION.,
8308,THIRD RECENSION.,It is important that it should be observed which the manuscripts are
8309,THIRD RECENSION.,which have thus been referred to and how their evidence is cited.
8310,THIRD RECENSION.,"They are divided always according to their recension, first, second"
8311,THIRD RECENSION.,"or third, and they are cited in an unvarying order, as follows:"
8312,THIRD RECENSION.,"AJMH₁X(G)ERCLB₂, SAdBTΔ, FWH₃ (or K), so that A ... B₂ means the whole"
8313,THIRD RECENSION.,"series of the first class, and S ... Δ that of the second, while"
8314,THIRD RECENSION.,"H₁ ... B₂ stands for H₁X(G)ERCLB₂, and E ... B₂ for ERCLB₂. These"
8315,THIRD RECENSION.,"nineteen (or eighteen) manuscripts are present as witnesses throughout,"
8316,THIRD RECENSION.,whether named or not; for when the manuscripts are named which give a
8317,THIRD RECENSION.,"variation, it is to be assumed that the remainder have the reading of"
8318,THIRD RECENSION.,the text. Thus the note
8319,THIRD RECENSION.,
8320,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘1295 wisdom] wordes H₁ ... B₂, H₃’"
8321,THIRD RECENSION.,
8322,THIRD RECENSION.,"must be taken to imply that ‘wisdom’ is the reading of AJM, SAdBTΔ, FW"
8323,THIRD RECENSION.,"and ‘wordes’ of H₁XGERCLB₂, H₃:"
8324,THIRD RECENSION.,
8325,THIRD RECENSION.,‘1296 gostly B’
8326,THIRD RECENSION.,
8327,THIRD RECENSION.,"means that the reading of the text, ‘goodly,’ is given by every one of"
8328,THIRD RECENSION.,the nineteen except B:
8329,THIRD RECENSION.,
8330,THIRD RECENSION.,‘1318 How þer(e) H₁G ... B₂’
8331,THIRD RECENSION.,
8332,THIRD RECENSION.,"means that the reading of the text is that of AJMX, SAdBTΔ, FWH₃ and"
8333,THIRD RECENSION.,that of the note belongs to H₁GERCLB₂:
8334,THIRD RECENSION.,
8335,THIRD RECENSION.,‘1330 for to] þat þou SAdBTΔ’
8336,THIRD RECENSION.,
8337,THIRD RECENSION.,indicates a reading of the second recension only:
8338,THIRD RECENSION.,
8339,THIRD RECENSION.,‘3340 tho] þe AM ... B₂’
8340,THIRD RECENSION.,
8341,THIRD RECENSION.,stands for the fact that all the first recension copies except J vary
8342,THIRD RECENSION.,"from F, while the rest agree. Occasionally readings of other MSS. are"
8343,THIRD RECENSION.,"cited besides those mentioned above, as Y, Λ or Magd., but the absence"
8344,THIRD RECENSION.,of such citation must not be taken to imply anything.
8345,THIRD RECENSION.,
8346,THIRD RECENSION.,"It must be observed, however, that in some cases a more limited"
8347,THIRD RECENSION.,"reference seemed desirable, especially on matters of form and spelling,"
8348,THIRD RECENSION.,points about which it would be idle to adduce any evidence but that of
8349,THIRD RECENSION.,"a few copies. Where selection of this kind is employed, the manuscripts"
8350,THIRD RECENSION.,on both sides are cited: thus such notes as
8351,THIRD RECENSION.,
8352,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘3691 set AJ, S, F sette C, B,’"
8353,THIRD RECENSION.,"‘4307 all S, F alle AJ, B’"
8354,THIRD RECENSION.,
8355,THIRD RECENSION.,must not be taken to imply the reading of any copy except those
8356,THIRD RECENSION.,mentioned. In a few cases this form is used to avoid misunderstanding
8357,THIRD RECENSION.,"in passages where the record of readings is for some reason incomplete,"
8358,THIRD RECENSION.,"as i. 2300, viii. 566, 1713, 1927."
8359,THIRD RECENSION.,
8360,THIRD RECENSION.,In citing a variation as given by a class or group of MSS. no attempt
8361,THIRD RECENSION.,is made to give the spelling of each one separately. The form cited is
8362,THIRD RECENSION.,that given either by the majority or by a leading MS. with variations
8363,THIRD RECENSION.,sometimes added in parentheses.
8364,THIRD RECENSION.,
8365,THIRD RECENSION.,Attention should be paid also to the following points: (1) It
8366,THIRD RECENSION.,was not found possible to complete the collation of the Glasgow
8367,THIRD RECENSION.,"MS. (G) before the text was printed, and consequently its"
8368,THIRD RECENSION.,"readings must not be taken as implied, when not mentioned, any"
8369,THIRD RECENSION.,further than v. 1970. The collation has since been completed
8370,THIRD RECENSION.,and some of the results are noted in the account of the MS.
8371,THIRD RECENSION.,"(2) K takes the place of H₃ in vi. 1671-vii. 1405, and vii."
8372,THIRD RECENSION.,"3594 to the end, where H₃ is defective. (3) Before assuming"
8373,THIRD RECENSION.,the evidence of any MS. _ex silentio_ it is necessary that
8374,THIRD RECENSION.,the reader should assure himself that it is not defective
8375,THIRD RECENSION.,in the part concerned. The means of doing this are fully
8376,THIRD RECENSION.,"afforded by the accounts given of the separate MSS., where"
8377,THIRD RECENSION.,"their imperfections are noted, and it must be remembered that"
8378,THIRD RECENSION.,J and Ad are for the most part defective as regards the Latin
8379,THIRD RECENSION.,"summaries, and that this is the case with T also in certain"
8380,THIRD RECENSION.,parts. The readings of S on f. 50 are for the most part passed
8381,THIRD RECENSION.,"over, as not originally belonging to that MS. (4) A few"
8382,THIRD RECENSION.,"abbreviated Latin terms are used in the critical notes, as _in"
8383,THIRD RECENSION.,"ras._ to indicate that the text is written over an erasure, or"
8384,THIRD RECENSION.,_p.m._ to denote the reading of the first hand.
8385,THIRD RECENSION.,
8386,THIRD RECENSION.,"The lines are numbered in each book (for the first time), and the"
8387,THIRD RECENSION.,numbers with an asterisk attached are those of the lines in other
8388,THIRD RECENSION.,recensions than that of the text. In addition to this it should be
8389,THIRD RECENSION.,observed that as nearly all references to Gower for the last forty
8390,THIRD RECENSION.,"years have been made by Pauli’s edition, it has been thought advisable"
8391,THIRD RECENSION.,to place in the margin of this text indications of the volumes and
8392,THIRD RECENSION.,"pages of that edition: thus =P. 1. 153= stands for ‘Pauli, vol. i. p."
8393,THIRD RECENSION.,153.’
8394,THIRD RECENSION.,
8395,THIRD RECENSION.,"Setting aside matters of spelling, punctuation and grammatical form, we"
8396,THIRD RECENSION.,may note that the material differences of reading between the text of
8397,THIRD RECENSION.,this edition and that of Pauli are in number about two thousand.
8398,THIRD RECENSION.,
8399,THIRD RECENSION.,
8400,THIRD RECENSION.,OTHER ENGLISH WORKS. With regard to the text of the poem _In Praise of
8401,THIRD RECENSION.,Peace_ all that need be said will be found in the notes upon it. The
8402,THIRD RECENSION.,"Trentham MS., which contains it, has already been fully described in"
8403,THIRD RECENSION.,the volume of ‘French Works.’
8404,THIRD RECENSION.,
8405,THIRD RECENSION.,"A poem in five seven-line stanzas, beginning ‘Passe forthe þou pilgryme"
8406,THIRD RECENSION.,"and bridel wele þy beste,’ occurs in (Shirley’s) MS. Ashmole 59, f."
8407,THIRD RECENSION.,"17 v^o (Bodl. Libr.), with the title ‘Balade moral of gode counseyle"
8408,THIRD RECENSION.,made by Gower.’ The same without the final stanza (owing to loss of a
8409,THIRD RECENSION.,"leaf) occurs in MS. Rawlinson C. 86, but with no title or ascription"
8410,THIRD RECENSION.,"of authorship, and both texts have been printed (not quite correctly)"
8411,THIRD RECENSION.,"by Dr. Karl Meyer in his _John Gower’s Beziehungen_, &c., 1889. In"
8412,THIRD RECENSION.,addition to these copies there is one in the British Museum MS. Addit.
8413,THIRD RECENSION.,"29729, which has been published by Dr. Max Förster in the _Archiv für"
8414,THIRD RECENSION.,"das Studium der neueren Sprachen_, vol. 102, p. 50. In this MS. the"
8415,THIRD RECENSION.,"piece is ascribed to Benedict Burgh, and it is called ‘A leson to kepe"
8416,THIRD RECENSION.,well the tonge.’
8417,THIRD RECENSION.,
8418,THIRD RECENSION.,It is almost impossible that these verses can have been written by
8419,THIRD RECENSION.,"Gower, but out of deference to Shirley’s authority (which is not very"
8420,THIRD RECENSION.,"weighty however), and in order that the reader may judge, it is printed"
8421,THIRD RECENSION.,"here, all deviations from the Ashmole text being noted, except in the"
8422,THIRD RECENSION.,"case of ‘th’ for ‘þ,’ and some readings of the Rawlinson copy (R) being"
8423,THIRD RECENSION.,added in parentheses.

8657,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"allowed by the auctioneers to examine the book before the sale, I am"
8658,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,able to give the following description of it.
8659,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,
8660,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"FOUNTAINE MS. Contains _Confessio Amantis_ with ‘Explicit’ (six lines),"

8662,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,Then at the end an alphabetical index to the contents of the poem.

8664,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"in double column of 46 lines to the column, Latin summaries in the"
8665,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"text, red: middle of the fifteenth century. Illustrated throughout with"
8666,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"well-painted miniatures, of which there were originally 108, including"
8667,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,pictures of the signs of the Zodiac and of the positions of the
8668,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"principal stars. Of these miniatures nine are missing from the book,"
8669,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,but these have now been identified with the series of nine miniatures
8670,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"in the possession of Mr. A. H. Frere, which are described on p. clxvi"
8671,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,of my Introduction. At the end of the text (f. 203) is written ‘And^w.
8672,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"Fountaine, 1791. Æ. 20.’"
8673,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,
8674,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"This is a very large folio, giving a fair text of the first"
8675,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,recension. The interest of it depends upon the miniatures. In
8676,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,describing the illustrated New College MS. 266 I remarked that
8677,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,other similar copies must once have existed. In saying this I
8678,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"was referring to the Frere miniatures, and it is a matter of"
8679,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,some interest to me to have been able to identify these with
8680,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,the nine which are missing from the Fountaine MS. The subjects
8681,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,of the Frere miniatures correspond duly with the places from
8682,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"which pictures have been cut out, and the words which in some"
8683,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,cases have been cut away with the pictures fit in with those
8684,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"that remain in the MS. For example, on f. 26 a miniature has"
8685,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"been cut out before i. 3067 (the tale of the Three Questions),"
8686,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,the text of the Latin summary above the missing picture being
8687,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,cut off after the words ‘tocius perdicionis.’ The Frere
8688,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"miniature which relates to this tale continues the sentence,"
8689,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,supplying the words ‘causam sua culpa ministrat’; and so also
8690,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,with some of the others. In some respects we can now correct
8691,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,our account of the Frere miniatures. The subjects of seven are
8692,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"correctly given in the description, but the last two represent,"
8693,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"as we can now see, (8) Alexander and the Pirate, iii. 2363 ff.,"

8695,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,"ff. The book was bought by Mr. Quaritch for £1550, certainly"
8696,AN ADDITIONAL MS. OF THE ‘CONFESSIO AMANTIS’,the highest price ever paid for a Gower manuscript.

31386,PROLOGUS,PROLOGUS
31387,PROLOGUS,
31388,PROLOGUS,_Latin Verses._ i. 1 f. The author acknowledges his incapacity for
31389,PROLOGUS,"higher themes, as at the beginning of the first book. The subject"
31390,PROLOGUS,of the present work is a less exalted one than that of those which
31391,PROLOGUS,preceded it.
31392,PROLOGUS,
31393,PROLOGUS,"3 f. _Qua tamen_ &c. The couplet may be translated, ‘Yet in that tongue"
31394,PROLOGUS,"of Hengist in which the island of Brut sings, I will utter English"
31395,PROLOGUS,measures by the aid of Carmentis.’
31396,PROLOGUS,
31397,PROLOGUS,"5 f. _Ossibus ergo carens_ &c. That is, ‘Let the evil tongue be far"
31398,PROLOGUS,"away.’ The reference is to Prov. xxv. 15, ‘A soft tongue breaketh the"
31399,PROLOGUS,"bone,’ taken here in a bad sense: cp. iii. 463 ff."
31400,PROLOGUS,
31401,PROLOGUS,
31402,PROLOGUS,7. ‘Moved by the example of these wise men of old.’ For this use of
31403,PROLOGUS,"‘ensampled’ cp. _Traitié_, xv. l. 4,"
31404,PROLOGUS,
31405,PROLOGUS,‘Pour essampler les autres du present.’
31406,PROLOGUS,
31407,PROLOGUS,13. _Who that al_ &c. ‘If one writes of wisdom only’: a common form of
31408,PROLOGUS,"expression in Gower’s French and English both; see note on _Mirour_,"
31409,PROLOGUS,"1244. In English we have ‘who that,’ ‘who so (that)’ or ‘what man"
31410,PROLOGUS,"(that),’ sometimes with indic. and sometimes with subjunctive: cp."
31411,PROLOGUS,"Prol. 460, 550, i. 383, 481, ii. 88, iii. 971, 2508, &c. See also note"
31412,PROLOGUS,on l. 460.
31413,PROLOGUS,
31414,PROLOGUS,"_writ_, present tense, syncopated form."
31415,PROLOGUS,
31416,PROLOGUS,"16. _if that ye rede_, ‘if ye so counsel me,’ i.e. if you approve,"
31417,PROLOGUS,"equivalent to the ‘si bon vous sembleroit’ of the _Mirour_, l. 33."
31418,PROLOGUS,
31419,PROLOGUS,"24. The marginal note is wanting in F and S, and may perhaps have"
31420,PROLOGUS,"been added after the year 1397, when Henry became Duke of Hereford,"
31421,PROLOGUS,"cp. ‘tunc Derbie comiti,’ or even later, for in the _Cron. Tripertita_"
31422,PROLOGUS,"Gower calls him Earl of Derby at the time of his exile, using the"
31423,PROLOGUS,"same expression as here, ‘tunc Derbie comiti.’ Caxton, followed by"
31424,PROLOGUS,"Berthelet, gives the following: ‘Hic in primis declarat Ioannes Gower"
31425,PROLOGUS,"quam ob causam presentem libellum composuit et finaliter compleuit, An."
31426,PROLOGUS,regni regis Ric. secundi 16.’
31427,PROLOGUS,
31428,PROLOGUS,"31. That is, compared with what it was in former time: cp. l. 133."
31429,PROLOGUS,
31430,PROLOGUS,41. _write ... stode_: subjunctive. For the subjunctive in indirect
31431,PROLOGUS,"question cp. ii. 1243, 1943, iii. 708, 771, &c."
31432,PROLOGUS,
31433,PROLOGUS,"43. _as who seith_, i.e. ‘as one may say,’ a qualification of what"
31434,PROLOGUS,"follows, ‘a gret partie’: the phrase is a common one, e.g. i. 1381, ‘as"
31435,PROLOGUS,"who seith, everemo,’ 2794, ii. 696, ‘as who seith, ded for feere,’ &c."
31436,PROLOGUS,
31437,PROLOGUS,"46. _schewen_, used absolutely, ‘set forth their histories.’"
31438,PROLOGUS,
31439,PROLOGUS,"52. _a burel clerk_, ‘a man of simple learning,’ esp. ‘a layman’; cp."
31440,PROLOGUS,"Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, B 3145, D 1872: ‘burel’ was a coarse cloth."
31441,PROLOGUS,
31442,PROLOGUS,"54. _tok_, ‘took place,’ ‘existed’: cp. Chaucer, _Troilus_, iv. 1562,"
31443,PROLOGUS,
31444,PROLOGUS,‘And if so be that pees herafter take.’
31445,PROLOGUS,
31446,PROLOGUS,"So ‘prendre’ in French, e.g. _Mir._ 831,"
31447,PROLOGUS,
31448,PROLOGUS,‘Le mariage devoit prendre.’
31449,PROLOGUS,
31450,PROLOGUS,"72. _the god_, so 198, ii. 594; cp. ‘the vertu,’ 116, ‘the manhode,’"
31451,PROLOGUS,"260, ‘the man,’ 546, 582, ‘The charite,’ 319, &c."
31452,PROLOGUS,
31453,PROLOGUS,"74. _ended_, ‘continued to the end.’"
31454,PROLOGUS,
31455,PROLOGUS,77 ff. Apparently a reference to the treatise on the duties of a ruler
31456,PROLOGUS,contained in the seventh book: ‘I shall make a discourse also with
31457,PROLOGUS,"regard to those who are in power, marking the distinction between the"
31458,PROLOGUS,virtues and the vices which belong to their office.’
31459,PROLOGUS,
31460,PROLOGUS,81 ff. ‘But as my wit is too small to correct the faults of every
31461,PROLOGUS,"one, I send this book unto my own lord Henry of Lancaster ... to be"
31462,PROLOGUS,amended at his command.’ For ‘upon amendement to stonde’ cp. ii. 583.
31463,PROLOGUS,The suggestion of amendment at the hands of the author’s patron is
31464,PROLOGUS,"of course a mere compliment, like that paid by Chaucer to Gower at"
31465,PROLOGUS,"the conclusion of _Troilus_, but it gives a modest appearance to the"
31466,PROLOGUS,general censure.
31467,PROLOGUS,
31468,PROLOGUS,It is not likely that the expression ‘upon amendement’ refers to the
31469,PROLOGUS,"change made in this part of the text, to which the author would hardly"
31470,PROLOGUS,"have called attention thus. Also, unless we explain as above, the"
31471,PROLOGUS,"meaning would seem to be ‘as my wit is too small to admonish every one,"
31472,PROLOGUS,"I send my work as now revised to my own lord Henry of Lancaster,’ a"
31473,PROLOGUS,much too pointed application of the coming admonitions.
31474,PROLOGUS,
31475,PROLOGUS,It is hardly needful to add that ‘to tellen every man his tale’ is not
31476,PROLOGUS,"a reference to the _Canterbury Tales_, as some have supposed."

31481,PROLOGUS,"is here followed, is as good as any other, but none of the copies which"
31482,PROLOGUS,"give the passage are thoroughly good in spelling, and the text has in"
31483,PROLOGUS,"this respect been slightly normalized. A and E are here defective, and"
31484,PROLOGUS,"J, which is the best available MS., has eccentricities of spelling"
31485,PROLOGUS,"(‘Richardus,’ ‘wyche,’ ‘hyt,’ ‘hys,’ ‘aftur,’ ‘resonabul,’ ‘ȝef,’ ‘be"
31486,PROLOGUS,"heste,’ ‘be ginne,’ &c.), which make it rather unsuitable as a basis"
31487,PROLOGUS,for the text. It will be found however that J and B mutually correct
31488,PROLOGUS,"each other to a great extent, and we have also MGRCL as additional"
31489,PROLOGUS,witnesses of a respectable character. Thus in regard to some of the
31490,PROLOGUS,variations in spelling from B we have as follows:--

31539,PROLOGUS,
31540,PROLOGUS,"34* ff. A very loosely constructed sentence. It means apparently, ‘I"
31541,PROLOGUS,"consider how it befell, as a thing destined then to come to pass,"
31542,PROLOGUS,"namely that as on Thames I came rowing by boat &c., I chanced to meet"
31543,PROLOGUS,my liege lord.’ The disorder in which the clauses are thrown together
31544,PROLOGUS,is a feature which we shall notice elsewhere in our author’s style.
31545,PROLOGUS,"‘The toun of newe Troye’ is of course London, supposed to have been"
31546,PROLOGUS,"founded by Brut of Troy, whence was derived ‘Britain,’ the ‘insula"
31547,PROLOGUS,Bruti’ of the opening lines.
31548,PROLOGUS,
31549,PROLOGUS,"52*. _loke_, ‘examine’: cp. ii. 733, vi. 1959."
31550,PROLOGUS,
31551,PROLOGUS,65*. There is here a corruption which affects all the existing copies.
31552,PROLOGUS,"The various readings are given in the critical notes, and evidently"
31553,PROLOGUS,‘outkrong’ is that which has most support. I conjecture that the
31554,PROLOGUS,"author wrote ‘onwrong,’ i.e. ‘awrong,’ which being an unusual word"
31555,PROLOGUS,"suffered corruption at the hand of the first transcriber, the ‘w’ being"
31556,PROLOGUS,"mistaken, as it easily might be, for ‘tk’: cp. Chaucer, _H. of Fame_,"
31557,PROLOGUS,"ii. 403, where ‘tokne’ is apparently a corruption of ‘towne.’"
31558,PROLOGUS,
31559,PROLOGUS,"66*. _the hevene king_, ‘the king of hevene.’ Gower regularly writes"
31560,PROLOGUS,"the final ‘e’ in ‘hevene,’ ‘evene,’ ‘evere,’ ‘nevere,’ &c. The"
31561,PROLOGUS,preceding syllable is of course syncopated in pronunciation.
31562,PROLOGUS,
31563,PROLOGUS,"69*. _what befalle_, ‘whatsoever may befall’: cp. iii. 325, ‘what it"
31564,PROLOGUS,were.’
31565,PROLOGUS,
31566,PROLOGUS,"75*. _bit_, i.e. ‘biddeth.’"
31567,PROLOGUS,
31568,PROLOGUS,"85*. The true reading is probably ‘listen pleie,’ which is preferable"
31569,PROLOGUS,"both as regards form and construction: cp. iv. 3147, ‘whan the wommen"
31570,PROLOGUS,"listen pleie.’ The readings are as follows: ‘listen pleye’ J, ‘lusten"
31571,PROLOGUS,"pleie’ M, ‘luste pley’ B₂; the rest mostly ‘lust to pleye.’ The verb"
31572,PROLOGUS,"seems usually to be followed by a preposition when used impersonally,"
31573,PROLOGUS,"as i. 147, 1403, and otherwise more generally not, as i. 2741, iv."
31574,PROLOGUS,"3147, but there are exceptions both ways, e.g. iv. 907 and iii. 111,"
31575,PROLOGUS,iv. 3187.
31576,PROLOGUS,
31577,PROLOGUS,90*. Cp. 54 ff.
31578,PROLOGUS,
31579,PROLOGUS,"92*. _for to newe._ This is the reading of the better MSS., and"
31580,PROLOGUS,‘schewe’ is probably the correction of a copyist who did not understand
31581,PROLOGUS,"it. The word ‘newe’ means here ‘produce,’ but in l. 59 ‘neweth’ is"
31582,PROLOGUS,intransitive and means ‘comes into being.’

31592,PROLOGUS,"decay throughout the world, and have no centre of rest there.’ (The"
31593,PROLOGUS,"first ‘que’ is the relative, for ‘quae.’) It is possible however that"
31594,PROLOGUS,"‘per orbem’ may refer again to Fortune’s wheel, cp. 138 ff., where"
31595,PROLOGUS,"the sense of this couplet seems to be expressed, and in that case the"
31596,PROLOGUS,"meaning is, ‘fall into decay as they turn upon the wheel.’"

31601,PROLOGUS,
31602,PROLOGUS,"122 ff. ‘And in witness of that I take the common voice of every land,"
31603,PROLOGUS,"which may not lie.’ This appeal to the common voice, the ‘commune"
31604,PROLOGUS,"dictum,’ is characteristic of our author, who repeats the proverb ‘Vox"
31605,PROLOGUS,"populi vox dei’ several times in various forms, e.g. _Mirour_, 12725."
31606,PROLOGUS,"For the use of ‘that’ in such expressions cp. l. 907, and iv. 2040."
31607,PROLOGUS,
31608,PROLOGUS,"133. _to loke_ &c., ‘when we look on all sides’: cp. 31, i. 1060, 2278,"
31609,PROLOGUS,&c.
31610,PROLOGUS,
31611,PROLOGUS,139. _blinde fortune._ ‘Fortune’ must here be taken as a proper

31618,PROLOGUS,
31619,PROLOGUS,‘Tho gan I wexen in a wer.’
31620,PROLOGUS,
31621,PROLOGUS,144 ff. ‘And especially if the power of the rulers of the world be not

31623,PROLOGUS,
31624,PROLOGUS,"152. _heved_, always a monosyllable in the metre: the word also appears"
31625,PROLOGUS,"as ‘hefd’ i. 199, and frequently as ‘hed.’"
31626,PROLOGUS,
31627,PROLOGUS,"154. _her trowthe allowe_, ‘approve of their loyalty,’ i.e. accept it."
31628,PROLOGUS,
31629,PROLOGUS,155. ‘And welcome them with all his heart.’ For the position of the
31630,PROLOGUS,"conjunction cp. 521, 756, 759, 1014, i. 854, 863, &c., and note on"

31637,PROLOGUS,
31638,PROLOGUS,162. A truce with both France and Scotland was made for three years in

31667,PROLOGUS,
31668,PROLOGUS,207 ff. The reference is to Lombard bankers employed as intermediaries
31669,PROLOGUS,in obtaining Church preferment. The ‘letter’ referred to is the papal
31670,PROLOGUS,"provision, or perhaps the letter of request addressed to the pope in"

31693,PROLOGUS,
31694,PROLOGUS,"220. ‘was then no charge of theirs,’ i.e. did not come under their"

31697,PROLOGUS,thing placed in a person’s charge.
31698,PROLOGUS,
31699,PROLOGUS,221. _The vein honour_: the definite form is rather less regularly used
31700,PROLOGUS,"by Gower in adjectives taken from French than in others, e.g. iii. 889,"
31701,PROLOGUS,"‘For with here fals compassement’; but on the other hand, i. 864, ‘the"

31709,PROLOGUS,(ecclesiastical) authority: cp. _Vox Clam._ iii. 227 ff. This is

31742,PROLOGUS,

31782,PROLOGUS,order to profit by the fines which may be imposed for breaches of
31783,PROLOGUS,morality and discipline. The meaning is fully illustrated by parallel

31785,PROLOGUS,"iii. 195; cp. Chaucer, _Pers. Tale_, 721. The sentence here is a little"

31898,PROLOGUS,"by Adrian I, and then against the rebellious citizens of Rome by Leo"

32333,LIB. I.,"(_Historia Troiana_, lib. 27: m 5, ed. Argent. 1494). The name Epius"
32334,LIB. I.,"is from Benoît, for Guido has ‘Apius’: on the other hand, Guido and"
32335,LIB. I.,not Benoît describes the horse as made of brass. In speaking of the
32336,LIB. I.,"discussion about pulling down a portion of the walls, and of the walls"
32337,LIB. I.,"themselves as built by Neptune, 1146, 1152 ff., our author is certainly"

32405,LIB. I.,"‘Wife of Bath’s Tale,’ but the details are in many ways different."
32406,LIB. I.,According to Chaucer the hero of the adventure is a knight of Arthur’s
32407,LIB. I.,court and the occasion of his trouble a much less creditable one than
32408,LIB. I.,in the case of Florent. In Chaucer’s tale the knight sees a fairy
32409,LIB. I.,"dance of ladies in the forest before he meets his repulsive deliverer,"
32410,LIB. I.,and she gets from him a promise that he will grant her next request
32411,LIB. I.,"if it lies in his power, the demand of marriage being put off until"
32412,LIB. I.,after the question has been successfully solved by her assistance. The
32413,LIB. I.,"rather unseasonable lectures on gentilesse, poverty, and old age are"
32414,LIB. I.,"not introduced by Gower. On the other hand, Chaucer’s alternative,"
32415,LIB. I.,"‘Will you have me old and ugly but a faithful wife, or young and fair"
32416,LIB. I.,with the attendant risks?’ is more pointed and satisfactory than the
32417,LIB. I.,"corresponding feature in Gower’s tale. Finally, Chaucer has nothing"
32418,LIB. I.,about the enchantment by which the lady had been transformed.

32420,LIB. I.,"It is tolerably certain that neither borrowed the story from the other,"

32428,LIB. I.,"F. Madden (Bannatyne Club, 1839) and contained in MS. Rawlinson C. 86."
32429,LIB. I.,In this ballad Arthur’s life is spared by a strange knight who meets
32430,LIB. I.,"him unarmed in the forest, on condition of answering his question,"
32431,LIB. I.,"‘What do women love best,’ at the end of twelve months. He is assisted"
32432,LIB. I.,"by Dame Ragnell, who demands in return to be married to Sir Gawain. Sir"
32433,LIB. I.,"Gawain accepts the proposal from loyalty to his lord, and the rest is"
32434,LIB. I.,much as in Gower’s version. It should be noted that the alternative of
32435,LIB. I.,day or night appears in the ballad and was a feature of the original
32436,LIB. I.,"story, which Chaucer altered."

32603,LIB. I.,"2377. _a place_, equivalent to ‘aplace,’ which we find in l. 1888, i.e."
32604,LIB. I.,"‘on place,’ ‘into place.’ We might read ‘aplace’ here also, for though"
32605,LIB. I.,"the words were at first written separately in F, there seems to have"
32606,LIB. I.,"been an intention of joining them afterwards. However, such separations"
32607,LIB. I.,"are often found elsewhere, as ‘a doun,’ iv. 2710, v. 385; ‘a ferr’; i."

32609,LIB. I.,
32610,LIB. I.,"2398. The reading of F, ‘Which elles scholde haue his wille,’ is a"
32611,LIB. I.,"possible one, but the preservation of final ‘e’ before ‘have’ used"
32612,LIB. I.,"unemphatically, as here, would be rather unusual. Instances such as"
32613,LIB. I.,"l. 2465, ‘a werre hadde,’ are not to the point, and in l. 2542, where"
32614,LIB. I.,"there is a better example, ‘Of such werk as it scholde have,’ the word"

32624,LIB. I.,have been one of the mistakes of the original copyist. The critical
32625,LIB. I.,"note here should be, ‘hunt(e) H₁YX ... C hante L haunt B₂,’ and the"
32626,LIB. I.,"actual reading in L is, ‘Haþ þilke errour hante in his office,’ which"

32637,LIB. I.,"2443. _daunger._ See note on _Balades_, xii. 8. The name represents the"
32638,LIB. I.,"influences which are unfavourable to the lover’s suit, and chiefly the"
32639,LIB. I.,feelings in the lady’s own mind which tend towards prudence or prompt
32640,LIB. I.,her to disdain. The personification in the _Roman de la Rose_ is well
32641,LIB. I.,"known. There Danger is the chief guardian of the rose-bush, and has for"
32642,LIB. I.,"his helpers Malebouche, who spreads unfavourable reports of the lover,"
32643,LIB. I.,"with Honte and Paour, who represent the feelings in the lady’s mind"
32644,LIB. I.,"which lead her to resist his advances: see _Roman de la Rose_, 2837"
32645,LIB. I.,"ff., Chaucer, _Leg. of G. Women_, B 160, _Troilus_, ii. 1376. Danger,"
32646,LIB. I.,"however, also stands without personification for scornfulness or"
32647,LIB. I.,"reluctance in love, and so the adjective ‘dangereus’ _Rom. de la Rose_,"
32648,LIB. I.,"479 (Eng. ‘dangerous,’ _Cant. Tales_, D 1090, ‘Is every knight of his"
32649,LIB. I.,so dangerous?’).

32651,LIB. I.,In the _Confessio Amantis_ the principal passages relating to Danger

32654,LIB. I.,"‘make daunger,’ ii. 1110; ‘withoute danger,’ iv. 1149: cp. Chaucer,"

32659,LIB. I.,
32660,LIB. I.,2459 ff. The story of Alboin and Rosemund is related by Paulus
32661,LIB. I.,"Diaconus, _Gest. Langob._ ii. 28, and after him by many others. This"
32662,LIB. I.,historian declares that he has himself seen the cup made of a skull
32663,LIB. I.,"from which the queen was invited to drink. According to him, Helmichis,"
32664,LIB. I.,"the king’s foster-brother and shield-bearer, plotted with Rosemunda"
32665,LIB. I.,against the king and induced her to gain the support of one Peredeus
32666,LIB. I.,by the device of substituting herself for her waiting-maid. In some
32667,LIB. I.,"versions of the story this Peredeus was omitted. For example, in the"
32668,LIB. I.,"_Pantheon_ of Godfrey of Viterbo (xvii), where the story is related"
32669,LIB. I.,"first in prose and then in verse, he is only slightly mentioned in the"
32670,LIB. I.,"prose account and not at all in the verse, Helmegis being substituted"
32671,LIB. I.,for him in both as the object of the queen’s artifice. It seems
32672,LIB. I.,"probable that Gower followed this author, with whose book we know he"
32673,LIB. I.,"was acquainted (viii. 271). The name of the waiting-maid, Glodeside,"
32674,LIB. I.,"seems to have been supplied by our author, who took it no doubt from"
32675,LIB. I.,"‘Glodosinda,’ the name of Alboin’s former wife. Helmege the king’s"
32676,LIB. I.,"‘boteler’ is the ‘Helmegis pincerna regis’ of the _Pantheon_, and some"
32677,LIB. I.,"expressions correspond closely, as 2474 (margin), ‘ciphum ex ea gemmis"
32678,LIB. I.,"et auro circumligatum ... fabricari constituit,’ with the line ‘Arte"
32679,LIB. I.,scyphum fieri statuens auroque ligari.’
32680,LIB. I.,
32681,LIB. I.,"The tale is well told by Gower, but he alters the final catastrophe,"
32682,LIB. I.,so as not to lengthen the story unnecessarily and divert attention
32683,LIB. I.,"from his principal object, which has to do with Alboin’s punishment"
32684,LIB. I.,for boasting and not with the fate of the adulterous pair. He is
32685,LIB. I.,responsible for most of the details: in the _Pantheon_ the story
32686,LIB. I.,occupies only sixty lines of Latin verse and is rather meagre in style.
32687,LIB. I.,"Compare, for example, the following with the account given by Gower of"
32688,LIB. I.,"the holding of the banquet, the cruel boast of Alboin, and the feelings"
32689,LIB. I.,"of the queen (2495-2569),"

32702,LIB. I.,prose account in the _Pantheon_.
32703,LIB. I.,
32704,LIB. I.,"2504. There is a stop after ‘ordeine’ in F, therefore ‘sende’ should be"
32705,LIB. I.,taken as a past tense rather than as infinitive dependent on ‘let.’

32707,LIB. I.,2533. ‘And took a pride within his heart.’

32709,LIB. I.,2548. The punctuation is that of the MSS.

32711,LIB. I.,"2569. _had mad._ The use of ‘had’ for ‘hadde’ in a position like this,"
32712,LIB. I.,where it is followed by a consonant (or of ‘hadde’ with the value of
32713,LIB. I.,"a monosyllable in such a position), is most unusual in Gower’s verse."
32714,LIB. I.,"If there were a little more authority for it, we might read ‘hath,’"
32715,LIB. I.,"as given by J: cp. iv. 170, where many of the best copies read ‘Had"
32716,LIB. I.,mad’ for ‘Hath mad.’ It is possible that the author meant here ‘hath
32717,LIB. I.,"had mad’ (‘had’ being past participle), but I cannot quote any clear"
32718,LIB. I.,example of this form of speech at so early a date.
32719,LIB. I.,
32720,LIB. I.,2642 ff. Here Gower departs from the authorities and winds up the story
32721,LIB. I.,"abruptly. According to the original story, Longinus the prefect of"

32772,LIB. I.,"thought better, but the alteration may have been made by the author to"

32825,LIB. I.,"is the past participle of ‘leten’ (lǣtan), and not from ‘letten,’"
32826,LIB. I.,meaning ‘hinder.’ In these expressions ‘lete’ means ‘left’ in the
32827,LIB. I.,"sense of ‘omitted’ (like ‘lete Of wrong to don,’ vii. 2726), and in"
32828,LIB. I.,"this usage is naturally followed by a negative: cp. v. 4465, ‘I wol"
32829,LIB. I.,"noght lete, What so befalle of mi beyete, That I ne schal hire yive and"
32830,LIB. I.,lene.’ The same phrase occurs with the past participle ‘let’ (meaning
32831,LIB. I.,"‘hindered’) in ii. 128, and the sense is nearly the same."

32876,LIB. II.,"Plowman_. The reference here has puzzled me rather, but the following,"
32877,LIB. II.,"I believe, is the explanation of it, strange as it may seem at first"
32878,LIB. II.,sight.
32879,LIB. II.,
32880,LIB. II.,"In the Institutions of Justinian, i. 7, ‘De lege Furia Caninia"
32881,LIB. II.,"sublata,’ we read that this law, which restricted the power of owners"
32882,LIB. II.,"of slaves to manumit them by will, was repealed ‘quasi libertatibus"
32883,LIB. II.,impedientem et quodammodo invidam.’ It seems that medieval commentators
32884,LIB. II.,"upon this, reading ‘canina’ for Caninia in the title of the law,"
32885,LIB. II.,explained the supposed epithet by reference to the adjective ‘invidam’
32886,LIB. II.,"used in the description of it, and conceived the law to have been"
32887,LIB. II.,called ‘canina’ because it compelled men to imitate the dog in the
32888,LIB. II.,manger by withholding liberty from those for whom they no longer had
32889,LIB. II.,any use as slaves. In Bromyard’s _Summa Predicantium_ we find the
32890,LIB. II.,following under the head of ‘Invidia’: ‘Omnes isti sunt de professione
32891,LIB. II.,legis Fusie canine. Ille enim Fusius inventor fuit legis cuius exemplum
32892,LIB. II.,seu casus est iste. Quidam habet fontem quo non potest proprium ortum
32893,LIB. II.,irrigare ... posset tamen alteri valere sine illius nocumento; ipse
32894,LIB. II.,"tamen impedit ne alteri prosit quod sibi prodesse non potest, ad modum"

32899,LIB. II.,
32900,LIB. II.,It seems likely then that Gower took the fable from some comment on
32901,LIB. II.,this passage of the Institutions.

33012,LIB. II.,"story was derived by the two authors from the same source, Nicholas"
33013,LIB. II.,Trivet’s Anglo-Norman chronicle. The story as told by him has been
33014,LIB. II.,"printed for the Chaucer Society from MS. Arundel 56, with collation of"
33015,LIB. II.,"a Stockholm copy (_Originals and Analogues_, 1872). The quotations in"
33016,LIB. II.,"these Notes, however, are from the Bodleian MS., Rawlinson B. 178."
33017,LIB. II.,
33018,LIB. II.,"Gower has followed the original more closely than Chaucer, but he"
33019,LIB. II.,"diverges from it in a good many points, as will be seen from the"
33020,LIB. II.,following enumeration:
33021,LIB. II.,
33022,LIB. II.,(1) Gower says nothing of the proficiency of Constance in sciences
33023,LIB. II.,"and languages, on which Trivet lays much stress. (2) He abridges the"
33024,LIB. II.,negotiations for marriage with the Souldan (620 ff.). (3) He does not
33025,LIB. II.,mention the seven hundred Saracens with whom the Souldan’s mother
33026,LIB. II.,conspired. (4) He brings Constance to land in Northumberland in the
33027,LIB. II.,summer instead of on Christmas day (732). (5) He omits the talk between
33028,LIB. II.,Constance and Hermyngeld which leads to the conversion of the latter
33029,LIB. II.,(cp. 752 ff.). (6) According to Trivet the blind man who received
33030,LIB. II.,his sight was one of the British Christians who had remained after
33031,LIB. II.,"the Saxon conquest, and he went to Wales to bring the bishop Lucius."
33032,LIB. II.,"(7) The knight who solicited Constance had been left, according to"
33033,LIB. II.,"Trivet, in charge during Elda’s absence, and planned his accusation"
33034,LIB. II.,against her for fear she should report his behaviour to Elda on his
33035,LIB. II.,return (cp. 792 ff.). (8) The words spoken when the felon knight was
33036,LIB. II.,smitten are not the same. Gower moreover makes him confess his crime
33037,LIB. II.,"and then die, whereas in the French book he is put to death by the"
33038,LIB. II.,king (cp. 879 ff.). (9) The reasons for Domilde’s hatred of Constance
33039,LIB. II.,are omitted by Gower. (10) Trivet says that Domilde gave the messenger
33040,LIB. II.,"a drugged potion on each occasion (cp. 952 ff., 1008 ff.). (11) The"
33041,LIB. II.,"communication to Constance of the supposed letter from the king, and"
33042,LIB. II.,"her acceptance of her fate, are omitted by Gower. (12) The prayers"
33043,LIB. II.,of Constance for herself and her child upon the sea and her nursing
33044,LIB. II.,of the child are additions made by Gower (1055-1083). (13) According
33045,LIB. II.,"to Trivet, Constance landed at the heathen admiral’s castle and was"
33046,LIB. II.,"entertained there, going back to her ship for the night. Then in the"
33047,LIB. II.,"night Thelous came to her, and professing to repent of having denied"
33048,LIB. II.,"his faith, prayed that he might go with her and return to a Christian"
33049,LIB. II.,"country. So they put out at sea, and he, moved by the devil, tempted"
33050,LIB. II.,"her to sin. She persuaded him to look out for land, with a promise of"
33051,LIB. II.,"yielding to his desires on reaching the shore, and while he is intent"
33052,LIB. II.,"on this occupation, she pushes him overboard (cp. 1084-1125). (14) The"
33053,LIB. II.,vengeance of king Alle on his mother is related by Trivet immediately
33054,LIB. II.,"after this, by Gower later. According to Trivet he hewed her to pieces"
33055,LIB. II.,(cp. 1226-1301). In the ballad of _Emaré_ the mother is condemned
33056,LIB. II.,"to be burnt, but her sentence is changed to exile. (15) Gower omits"
33057,LIB. II.,the entry of king Alle into Rome and the incident of his being seen
33058,LIB. II.,by Constance as he passed through the streets. (16) Trivet says that
33059,LIB. II.,"when Morice took the message to the Emperor, the latter was struck by"
33060,LIB. II.,his resemblance to his lost daughter. (17) Gower adds the incident of
33061,LIB. II.,Constance riding forward to meet her father (1500 ff.). (18) According
33062,LIB. II.,"to Trivet, Constance returned to Rome because of the illness of her"
33063,LIB. II.,father (cp. 1580 ff.).
33064,LIB. II.,
33065,LIB. II.,"These differences, besides others of detail, show that Gower treated"
33066,LIB. II.,the story with some degree of freedom.
33067,LIB. II.,
33068,LIB. II.,"Before Trivet was known as the common source for Chaucer and Gower,"
33069,LIB. II.,Tyrrwhitt suggested that Chaucer’s tale was taken from Gower. Chaucer
33070,LIB. II.,in fact criticizes and rejects one feature of the tale which occurs in
33071,LIB. II.,"Gower’s version of it, namely the sending of ‘the child Maurice’ to"
33072,LIB. II.,"invite the Emperor. This incident however comes from Trivet, and it is"
33073,LIB. II.,probably to him that Chaucer refers.
33074,LIB. II.,
33075,LIB. II.,It has been argued however in recent times from certain minute
33076,LIB. II.,resemblances in detail and forms of expression between Chaucer’s tale
33077,LIB. II.,"and Gower’s, that Chaucer was acquainted with Gower’s rendering of"
33078,LIB. II.,"the story as well as with Trivet’s (E. Lücke in _Anglia_, vol. xiv);"
33079,LIB. II.,"and the same line of reasoning has been employed by others, e.g. Dr."
33080,LIB. II.,"Skeat in his edition of Chaucer, to prove that Gower borrowed to"
33081,LIB. II.,some extent from Chaucer. It seems probable that Chaucer’s tale of
33082,LIB. II.,"Constance was written earlier than Gower’s, and it is likely enough"
33083,LIB. II.,that Gower was acquainted with his friend’s work and may have conveyed
33084,LIB. II.,some expressions from it into his own. Lücke adduces twenty-seven
33085,LIB. II.,"instances, more than half of them trivial or unconvincing, but"
33086,LIB. II.,amounting on the whole to a tolerably strong proof that one of the two
33087,LIB. II.,poets was acquainted with the other’s story. The most convincing of the
33088,LIB. II.,"parallels are the following: Gower, ‘Let take anon this Constantine’"
33089,LIB. II.,"706, Chaucer, ‘And Custance have they take anon’ _Cant. Tales_, B 438;"
33090,LIB. II.,"Gower, ‘lich hir oghne lif Constance loveth’ 750, Chaucer, ‘loved hire"
33091,LIB. II.,"right as hir lif’ B 535; Gower, ‘yif me my sihte’ 765, Chaucer, ‘yif me"
33092,LIB. II.,"my sighte again’ B 560, Trivet, ‘qe tu me facetz le signe de la croiz"
33093,LIB. II.,"sur mes eux enveugles’ f. 34; Gower, ‘The king with many another mo"
33094,LIB. II.,"Hath christned’ 907, Chaucer, ‘The kyng and many another in that place"
33095,LIB. II.,"converted was’ B 685; Gower, ‘to kepe his wif’ 925, Chaucer, ‘his wyf"
33096,LIB. II.,"to kepe’ B 717; Gower, ‘goth to seke Ayein the Scottes for to fonde The"
33097,LIB. II.,"werre’ 928 ff.; Chaucer, ‘whan he is gon To Scotlondward, his fomen for"
33098,LIB. II.,"to seke’ B 717 f.; Gower, ‘The time set of kinde is come, This lady"
33099,LIB. II.,"hath hir chambre nome’ 931 f. Chaucer, ‘She halt hire chambre abiding"
33100,LIB. II.,Cristes wille. The tyme is come’ B 721 f. These resemblances of phrase
33101,LIB. II.,are such as we might expect to find if Gower had read Chaucer’s story
33102,LIB. II.,"before writing his own. In all essentials he is independent, and it"
33103,LIB. II.,"is surely not necessary to suppose, as Dr. Skeat does, that a quarrel"
33104,LIB. II.,between them was caused by such a matter as this.
33105,LIB. II.,
33106,LIB. II.,590. Tiberius Constantinus was Emperor (at Constantinople) for four
33107,LIB. II.,"years only, 578-582; his wife’s name was Anastasia. He selected Maurice"
33108,LIB. II.,"of Cappadocia to succeed him, and gave him his daughter in marriage."
33109,LIB. II.,"The romance related by Trivet seems to have no historical foundation,"
33110,LIB. II.,but it was during the reign of Maurice that the mission went from Rome
33111,LIB. II.,"for the conversion of the English, and this may have had something to"
33112,LIB. II.,do with the story that Maurice himself was partly of English origin.
33113,LIB. II.,"Trivet himself mentions the historical form of the story, but pretends"
33114,LIB. II.,"that he finds a different account in the old Saxon chronicles, ‘les"
33115,LIB. II.,"aunciens croniques des Sessouns,’ or ‘l’estoire de Sessons.’"
33116,LIB. II.,
33117,LIB. II.,594. _the god_: cp. Prol. 72. We find both ‘god’ and ‘godd’ as forms of
33118,LIB. II.,"spelling, so ‘rod’ and ‘rodd,’ ‘bed’ and ‘bedd.’ Here ‘godd’ has been"
33119,LIB. II.,altered in F by erasure.
33120,LIB. II.,
33121,LIB. II.,"613. Both Chaucer and Gower make the Souldan send for the merchants,"
33122,LIB. II.,whereas in Trivet they are brought before him on accusation: but in
33123,LIB. II.,"fact here Gower agrees in essentials with Trivet, while Chaucer invents"
33124,LIB. II.,a quite different occasion for the interview.
33125,LIB. II.,
33126,LIB. II.,"653. _Betwen hem two_, ‘by themselves together’: cp. 752, 3517, iii."
33127,LIB. II.,1466.
33128,LIB. II.,
33129,LIB. II.,684. _Hire clos Envie_: see note on Prol. 221. The metaphor here may
33130,LIB. II.,"be from spreading a net, or perhaps it means simply she displayed her"
33131,LIB. II.,secret envy.
33132,LIB. II.,
33133,LIB. II.,"693 f. Compare Chaucer’s development of the idea with examples, _Cant."
33134,LIB. II.,"Tales_, B 470 ff."
33135,LIB. II.,
33136,LIB. II.,709. _withoute stiere_: Chaucer says ‘a ship al steereles’ where Trivet
33137,LIB. II.,"has ‘sanz sigle et sanz naviroun,’ or ‘sanz viron’ (MS. Rawl.): but"
33138,LIB. II.,either ‘viron’ or ‘naviron’ might stand for the oar with which the ship
33139,LIB. II.,was steered.
33140,LIB. II.,
33141,LIB. II.,709 ff. Note the free transposition of clauses for the sake of the
33142,LIB. II.,"rhymes. The logical order would be 709, 711, 710, 713, 712."
33143,LIB. II.,
33144,LIB. II.,"711. _for yeres fyve._ Trivet says ‘pur treis aunz,’ but he keeps her at"
33145,LIB. II.,sea nevertheless for nearly five.
33146,LIB. II.,
33147,LIB. II.,"736. _gon_, plural, ‘he and his wife go’: cp. 1152."
33148,LIB. II.,
33149,LIB. II.,"749 ff. In the MSS. the paragraph begins at ‘Constance loveth,’ l. 751."
33150,LIB. II.,
33151,LIB. II.,"752. ‘They speaking every day together alone,’ an absolute use: cp."
33152,LIB. II.,1723. For ‘betwen hem two’ cp. 653.
33153,LIB. II.,
33154,LIB. II.,762. Punctuated after ‘hire’ in F.
33155,LIB. II.,
33156,LIB. II.,771. _Thou bysne man._ The word ‘bysne’ is taken from the original
33157,LIB. II.,"story. Trivet says she spoke in the Saxon language and said, ‘Bisne"
33158,LIB. II.,"man, en Ihesu name in rode yslawe haue þi siht’ (MS. Rawl. f. 34)."
33159,LIB. II.,
33160,LIB. II.,"785. _As he that._ The reference is to the king, so that we should"
33161,LIB. II.,"rather expect ‘As him that,’ but the phrase is a stereotyped one and"
33162,LIB. II.,does not always vary in accordance with grammatical construction: cp.
33163,LIB. II.,"1623. We find however also ‘As him which,’ iii. 1276."
33164,LIB. II.,
33165,LIB. II.,791. ‘The time being appointed moreover’: an absolute use of the
33166,LIB. II.,participle.
33167,LIB. II.,
33168,LIB. II.,831. ‘trencha la gowle Hermigild’: therefore the fact that Gower
33169,LIB. II.,and Chaucer agree in saying that he cut her throat has no special
33170,LIB. II.,significance.
33171,LIB. II.,
33172,LIB. II.,"833. The reading ‘that dier,’ or ‘that diere,’ was apparently a mistake"
33173,LIB. II.,of the original copyist. It appears in all the unrevised copies of the
33174,LIB. II.,first recension and also in B. Λ however has the corrected reading.
33175,LIB. II.,
33176,LIB. II.,"857. _After_, ‘In accordance with.’"
33177,LIB. II.,
33178,LIB. II.,"880 ff. Here Chaucer follows the original more closely than Gower, as"
33179,LIB. II.,"also just above, ‘him smoot upon the nekke boon.’ The words of the"
33180,LIB. II.,"miraculous voice are given in Latin by Trivet, ‘Aduersus filiam matris"
33181,LIB. II.,ecclesie ponebas scandalum: hoc fecisti et tacui’ (‘et non tacui’ Rawl.
33182,LIB. II.,"Stockh.). Chaucer has (B 674 ff.),"
33183,LIB. II.,
33184,LIB. II.,"‘And seyde, “Thou hast desclaundred gilteles"
33185,LIB. II.,The doughter of holy chirche in heigh presence:
33186,LIB. II.,Thus hastou doon and yet holde I my pees.”’
33187,LIB. II.,
33188,LIB. II.,"895. This line occurs several times, e.g. i. 2106, ii. 2670."
33189,LIB. II.,
33190,LIB. II.,"905. _Lucie_, apparently to be pronounced ‘Lucíe.’ Such names usually"
33191,LIB. II.,"appear either in the Latin forms ‘Lucius,’ ‘Tiberius,’ ‘Claudius,’"
33192,LIB. II.,"‘Virginius,’ or with accent on the antepenultimate syllable ‘Tibérie,’"
33193,LIB. II.,"‘Mercúrie,’ the ‘i’ not being counted as a syllable."
33194,LIB. II.,
33195,LIB. II.,947. What the right name really is we can hardly say for certain. The
33196,LIB. II.,"printed text of the French gives ‘Domulde’ or ‘Domilde,’ the Rawlinson"
33197,LIB. II.,"MS. has ‘Downilde,’ and Chaucer makes it ‘Donegild.’"
33198,LIB. II.,
33199,LIB. II.,964. _which is of faierie._ In the French book the letter states that
33200,LIB. II.,the queen has been transformed since the king’s departure into the
33201,LIB. II.,likeness of another creature and is an evil spirit in woman’s form.
33202,LIB. II.,

33207,LIB. II.,
33208,LIB. II.,1010. The manuscript has a stop after ‘drunke’ and this seems best.
33209,LIB. II.,
33210,LIB. II.,1020. Here we have apparently one of the original corruptions of the
33211,LIB. II.,author’s text.
33212,LIB. II.,
33213,LIB. II.,1046 ff. The original has only ‘grant duel et grant dolour demeneient.’

33223,LIB. II.,"it hath,’ &c."
33224,LIB. II.,

33226,LIB. II.,Sone’: cp. 736.
33227,LIB. II.,
33228,LIB. II.,1163. Trivet adds ‘qar issit l’apelerent les Sessoneis’ f. 35 v^o.

33232,LIB. II.,
33233,LIB. II.,"1173. The stop after ‘Romeward’ is on the authority of F, with which A"
33234,LIB. II.,"agrees. We can say either, ‘He was coming from Barbarie towards Rome,"
33235,LIB. II.,"and was going home,’ or ‘He was coming from Barbarie, and was going"
33236,LIB. II.,home towards Rome’; but the latter perhaps is the more natural.
33237,LIB. II.,
33238,LIB. II.,"1191. _made sche no chiere._ This must mean here, ‘she gave no outward"
33239,LIB. II.,sign of her thought.’ Usually ‘to make cheer’ means to be cheerful.
33240,LIB. II.,
33241,LIB. II.,"1243. _what child that were_, subjunctive in indirect question: cp."
33242,LIB. II.,"1943, iii. 708, 771, &c. See note on Prol. 41."
33243,LIB. II.,
33244,LIB. II.,1259. _alle well_: ‘wel’ seems to be a substantive.
33245,LIB. II.,
33246,LIB. II.,1275. _as seith the bok._ The ‘book’ only says ‘ia tut enflammé de ire.’
33247,LIB. II.,
33248,LIB. II.,1285. _I schal be venged_: cp. v. 6766. The first and second recensions
33249,LIB. II.,have ‘It schal.’
33250,LIB. II.,
33251,LIB. II.,1300. _was after sunge._ The French book does not say this. It seems
33252,LIB. II.,"probable that Gower was acquainted with ballads on the subject, such as"
33253,LIB. II.,"that of _Emaré_, printed in Ritson’s _Metrical Romances_, ii. 204 ff."
33254,LIB. II.,It is to be noted that _Emaré_ is taken from a Breton lay:
33255,LIB. II.,
33256,LIB. II.,"‘Thys ys of Brytayne layes,"
33257,LIB. II.,That was used by olde dayes
33258,LIB. II.,Men callys playn the garye.’
33259,LIB. II.,
33260,LIB. II.,1317. According to Trivet he came especially to get absolution for
33261,LIB. II.,"having killed his mother, and Chaucer follows him here."
33262,LIB. II.,
33263,LIB. II.,1329. _In help to ben his herbergour._ This seems to mean that the
33264,LIB. II.,question was asked with a view to helping to provide a lodging for the
33265,LIB. II.,king. The expression is rather obscure however.
33266,LIB. II.,
33267,LIB. II.,"1351. _seknesse of the See._ This is absurd here, but not so in the"
33268,LIB. II.,original story. Constance attributes her weakness to the effects
33269,LIB. II.,"produced by her long wanderings at sea, ‘se acundut par feblesce de sa"
33270,LIB. II.,cervele que lui avint en la mere’ f. 36.
33271,LIB. II.,
33272,LIB. II.,"1369. _sihe_, subjunctive, ‘so that the king might see him.’"
33273,LIB. II.,

33275,LIB. II.,
33276,LIB. II.,"1393. ‘a ship which was,’ cp. i. 10."
33277,LIB. II.,
33278,LIB. II.,1405 f. See note on 1163. Trivet speaks here only of the name of Moris.
33279,LIB. II.,
33280,LIB. II.,"1423 f. Gower’s more usual form would be, ‘Desireth not the heaven so"
33281,LIB. II.,"much, that he ne longeth more,’ as i. 718, &c."
33282,LIB. II.,
33283,LIB. II.,"1464 ff. The connexion of this remark is clearer in the original story,"
33284,LIB. II.,"which says that Constance told her husband, if the Emperor should"
33285,LIB. II.,"refuse his prayer, to ask ‘pur l’amur q’il avoit al alme sa fille"
33286,LIB. II.,Constaunce’; because she knew that he denied no one who prayed in this
33287,LIB. II.,form.
33288,LIB. II.,
33289,LIB. II.,"1586 ff. _after that_, ‘according as’: cp. Prol. 544, iii. 1074. The"
33290,LIB. II.,book says in fact with much apparent accuracy that Alla died nine
33291,LIB. II.,"months after his return, that Constance returned to Rome half a year"
33292,LIB. II.,"after, ‘pur la novele qe ele oit de la maladie son pere,’ that on"
33293,LIB. II.,the thirteenth day after her arrival the Emperor died in the arms
33294,LIB. II.,"of his daughter, and she followed him in a year, the date being St."
33295,LIB. II.,"Clement’s day of the year 585. It is further stated that Elda, who had"
33296,LIB. II.,"accompanied Constance to Rome, died at Tours on his way back to England."
33297,LIB. II.,
33298,LIB. II.,1599. _the wel meninge of love._ In spite of the variations there can
33299,LIB. II.,hardly be a doubt about the true reading here. The word is clearly
33300,LIB. II.,"‘meninge’ both in F and S, and the change to ‘whel’ was suggested no"
33301,LIB. II.,"doubt by the misreading ‘meuinge.’ For the expression cp. iii. 599, ‘To"
33302,LIB. II.,love and to his welwillinge.’
33303,LIB. II.,
33304,LIB. II.,1613 ff. Gower apparently pieced together this story of Demetrius and
33305,LIB. II.,"Perseus from several sources, for it does not seem to occur in any"
33306,LIB. II.,"single authority precisely as he gives it. The first part, which has"
33307,LIB. II.,to do with the false accusation brought against Demetrius and its
33308,LIB. II.,"consequences, agrees with the account given in Justin, _Epitome_, lib."
33309,LIB. II.,xxxii. The story of the daughter of Paulus Emilius and her little dog
33310,LIB. II.,"is told by Valerius Maximus, _Mem._ i. 5. 3. Finally, the details"
33311,LIB. II.,of the defeat of Perseus seem to be taken from the account of a
33312,LIB. II.,"catastrophe which about the same time befell the Basternae, a Thracian"
33313,LIB. II.,"tribe allied with Perseus, who according to Orosius (iv. 20), when"
33314,LIB. II.,"crossing the Danube in winter with large numbers of men and horses,"
33315,LIB. II.,were almost annihilated by the breaking of the ice. The same author
33316,LIB. II.,mentions that after the defeat and capture of Perseus his son exercised
33317,LIB. II.,the craft of a brass-worker at Rome.
33318,LIB. II.,
33319,LIB. II.,It is possible of course that Gower had before him some single account
33320,LIB. II.,"in which these elements were already combined. In Vincent of Beauvais,"
33321,LIB. II.,"_Speculum Hist._ v. 65 f., we find first the catastrophe of the"
33322,LIB. II.,"Basternae, taken from Orosius, then the Macedonian war from Justin and"
33323,LIB. II.,"Orosius, with the incident of the dog inserted from Valerius."
33324,LIB. II.,
33325,LIB. II.,"1631 (margin). _testibus que iudicibus_, ‘witnesses and judges,’ a"
33326,LIB. II.,common use of the conjunction in Gower’s Latin: cp. ‘Celsior est Aquila
33327,LIB. II.,"que Leone ferocior,’ _Latin Verses after_ i. 574."
33328,LIB. II.,
33329,LIB. II.,"1633. _dorst_, so here in the best MSS. for ‘dorste.’"
33330,LIB. II.,
33331,LIB. II.,"1711. _apparant_, for ‘heir apparant,’ which was the original reading of"
33332,LIB. II.,"the first recension: cp. _Mirour_, 5580,"
33333,LIB. II.,
33334,LIB. II.,‘Car d’autre bien n’est apparant.’
33335,LIB. II.,
33336,LIB. II.,1723. _livende his father_: for this absolute use cp. 752.
33337,LIB. II.,
33338,LIB. II.,"1757. _upon depos_, that is, having his power given to him as a"
33339,LIB. II.,temporary charge. See the examples in the _New Engl. Dict._
33340,LIB. II.,
33341,LIB. II.,1778. _And he._ ‘As he’ is an error which crept into the third
33342,LIB. II.,recension. The interchange of ‘As’ with ‘And’ in Gower MSS. is very
33343,LIB. II.,common.
33344,LIB. II.,
33345,LIB. II.,"1793 f. ‘For such an omen of an hound was most like to him,’ the words"

33347,LIB. II.,
33348,LIB. II.,1799. _do slain._ This is apparently past participle by attraction for
33349,LIB. II.,"infinitive: cp. i. 3153, iv. 249, 816."
33350,LIB. II.,
33351,LIB. II.,1817 ff. This incident is not related of the army of Perseus in any
33352,LIB. II.,"history, so far as I know: see note on 1613."

33359,LIB. II.,

33382,LIB. II.,"from an O. E. ‘*hǣd,’ a collateral form of ‘hád,’ like the termination"
33383,LIB. II.,"‘-hed’ for ‘-hod.’ See _New Engl. Dict._, ‘hede.’ In that case, ‘of his"
33384,LIB. II.,oghne hed’ would mean ‘about his own condition.’ The rhyme with ‘red’

33399,LIB. II.,
33400,LIB. II.,"2157 ff. The story is mainly taken from Ovid, _Metam._ ix. 101 ff.,"
33401,LIB. II.,"but probably Gower was acquainted also with the epistle, _Deianira"
33402,LIB. II.,"Herculi_, and he has (naturally enough) supposed that what is there"
33403,LIB. II.,"said of Hercules and Omphale, the exchange of clothes &c., referred to"
33404,LIB. II.,the relations of Hercules and Iole: see 2268 ff. ‘The kinges dowhter of
33405,LIB. II.,Eurice’ is no doubt derived from the expression ‘Eurytidosque Ioles’:
33406,LIB. II.,"cp. _Traitié_, vii. 2. Ovid’s account of the death of Hercules is very"

33445,FH₃.,2451 ff. In the MSS. the paragraph is marked as beginning with the next
33446,FH₃.,"line, ‘At Troie how that,’ the line before being insignificant. As to"
33447,FH₃.,"the first story referred to in the text, Gower may have known it from"
33448,FH₃.,"Hyginus (_Fab._ cvi), or from Ovid, _Her. Ep._ iii. The example of"
33449,FH₃.,"Diomede and Troilus had been popularized by Chaucer, who had the name"
33450,FH₃.,‘Criseide’ from Boccaccio’s ‘Griseida.’ In Benoît and Guido the name is
33451,FH₃.,"‘Briseida,’ but Boccaccio was aware that Briseis was a different person"
33452,FH₃.,"(_Gen. Deorum_, xii. 52)."
33453,FH₃.,
33454,FH₃.,2459 ff. The name Geta was taken by Gower from the Geta of Vitalis
33455,FH₃.,"Blesensis, a dramatic piece in Latin elegiacs founded on Plautus, in"
33456,FH₃.,"which Geta takes the place of Sosia: see Wright’s Early Mysteries,"
33457,FH₃.,"&c., pp. 79-90. It may be suspected that our author himself"
33458,FH₃.,modified the story in order to make it more suitable for his purpose by
33459,FH₃.,substituting a mortal friend for Jupiter. We may note that he has also
33460,FH₃.,reversed the part played by Amphitryon.

33467,FH₃.,
33468,FH₃.,2550. _which that him beclipte._ Either this means ‘who was encompassing

33470,FH₃.,"Egypt, or ‘which encircled his territory,’ referring to what follows,"
33471,FH₃.,‘in a Marche costeiant.’ In the latter case we should have a very bold
33472,FH₃.,"inversion of clauses for the sake of rhyme, but hardly more so than in"
33473,FH₃.,709 ff.
33474,FH₃.,
33475,FH₃.,2558. _unto Kaire._ It is evident that the author conceives this as the

33485,FH₃.,
33486,FH₃.,"2680. _tome_, i.e. ‘leisure,’ ‘opportunity,’ from the adjective ‘tom,’"
33487,FH₃.,empty. The reading ‘come’ is due probably to the misunderstanding of a

33489,FH₃.,"an admissible one (cp. K. Fahrenburg in _Archiv für neuere Sprachen_,"
33490,FH₃.,"vol. 89, p. 406, who of course is not aware of the corruption)."
33491,FH₃.,
33492,FH₃.,2803. The account of Boniface VIII which was most current in England
33493,FH₃.,is that which we find given in Rishanger’s Chronicle and repeated by
33494,FH₃.,"Higden and Walsingham. It is as follows, under the year 1294:--"

33521,FH₃.,
33522,FH₃.,It remains to be asked where Gower found the story of the
33523,FH₃.,speaking-trumpet by means of which Celestin was moved to his
33524,FH₃.,"abdication, why he supposed that the capture of Boniface took place"
33525,FH₃.,"near Avignon, and whence came such additional details as we have in l."
33526,FH₃.,3028.
33527,FH₃.,
33528,FH₃.,"As to the first, it was certainly a current story, because we find it"
33529,FH₃.,"repeated by later writers, as Paulus Langius, _Chron. Citiz._, ann."
33530,FH₃.,"1294, ‘Per fistulam etiam frequentius noctu in cubili per parietem"

33533,FH₃.,excedit.”’
33534,FH₃.,
33535,FH₃.,"As to the death of Boniface, it was commonly reported that he had"
33536,FH₃.,"been starved in prison, the fact being that after the episode of his"
33537,FH₃.,"captivity he refused to take food, and the biting of his hands was"
33538,FH₃.,"observed as a symptom of extreme vexation, ‘saepe caput muro concussit"
33539,FH₃.,"et digitos momordit,’ ‘per plures dies ira feruidus manus sibi arrodere"
33540,FH₃.,"videbatur,’ &c. Ciacon. _Vita Pont._ p. 655."

33553,FH₃.,"equivalent, in the English Chronicles quoted, and also in Villani. The"
33554,FH₃.,true name was apparently ‘de Nogaret.’
33555,FH₃.,
33556,FH₃.,"3001. _at Avinoun._ This is quite unhistorical, and the precise mention"
33557,FH₃.,"of ‘Pontsorge’ (or as our author first wrote it, ‘Poursorge’) seems to"
33558,FH₃.,"point to the use of some particular form of the story, which cannot at"
33559,FH₃.,present be indicated.
33560,FH₃.,
33561,FH₃.,"3033 ff. This saying is sometimes given in the form of a prophecy, and"
33562,FH₃.,"attributed to the predecessor of Boniface, whose resignation he was"
33563,FH₃.,said to have procured: see the passage quoted on l. 2803.
33564,FH₃.,
33565,FH₃.,"3037. _to the houndes like_, ‘after the likeness of the hound’: cp. i."
33566,FH₃.,"2791, ‘to his liche.’ The form ‘like’ would hardly be admissible here"
33567,FH₃.,as an adjective for ‘lik.’
33568,FH₃.,
33569,FH₃.,3056. This prophecy no doubt was current among the many attributed to
33570,FH₃.,"the Abbot Joachim, but I do not find it exactly in the form here given."
33571,FH₃.,The quotation of it in the margin of F is in a different hand from that
33572,FH₃.,of the text and of the heading ‘Nota de prophecia’ &c. The omission of
33573,FH₃.,"the Latin altogether in some manuscripts, as AdT, W, has no special"
33574,FH₃.,significance for this passage.

33576,FH₃.,3081 f. ‘He shall not be able to abstain from hindering him.’
33577,FH₃.,
33578,FH₃.,"3095. This saying, which is here attributed to Seneca, and which"
33579,FH₃.,"appears also in the _Mirour de l’omme_ in a slightly different form,"
33580,FH₃.,"3831 ff., may be based really upon the well-known passage of Dante,"

33594,FH₃.,3187. The Latin books referred to are the current lives of Saint
33595,FH₃.,"Silvester, the substance of which is reproduced in the _Legenda Aurea_."
33596,FH₃.,Gower tells the story in considerably better style than we have it
33597,FH₃.,"there, with amplifications of his own, especially as regards the"
33598,FH₃.,"reflections of Constantine, 3243 ff., and the preaching of Silvester"
33599,FH₃.,"to the Emperor, 3383 ff. There are some variations in detail from the"
33600,FH₃.,current account which may or may not point to a special source. For
33601,FH₃.,"example, in the Life of Silvester we are told that the Emperor met the"
33602,FH₃.,lamenting mothers as he was riding up to the Capitol to take his bath
33603,FH₃.,"of blood, and in all forms of the legend that I have seen the mountain"
33604,FH₃.,where Silvester lay in hiding was Soracte (or Saraptis) and not Celion.
33605,FH₃.,"The name may however have been altered by Gower for metrical reasons,"
33606,FH₃.,as was sometimes his habit; see note on i. 1407 (end).
33607,FH₃.,
33608,FH₃.,3210. _of Accidence._ ‘Accidentia’ in its medical sense is explained as
33609,FH₃.,‘affectus praeter naturam’: cp. v. 763.
33610,FH₃.,
33611,FH₃.,"3243 ff. These reflections, continued to l. 3300, are an expanded"
33612,FH₃.,and improved form of the rather tasteless string of maxims given
33613,FH₃.,"in the legend, the most pointed of which is that with which our"
33614,FH₃.,"author concludes, ‘Omnium se esse dominum comprobat, qui servum se"
33615,FH₃.,monstraverit pietatis.’
33616,FH₃.,
33617,FH₃.,3260. _his oghne wone._ This appears to mean ‘according to his own
33618,FH₃.,"habits,’ like ‘his oghne hondes’ (i. 1427), ‘his oghne mouth’ (v."
33619,FH₃.,"5455), for ‘with his own hands,’ &c."
33620,FH₃.,
33621,FH₃.,"3507. _vertu sovereine_: a clear case of the French feminine inflexion,"
33622,FH₃.,which must have been a very natural variation in such expressions as
33623,FH₃.,this; cp. i. 2677. In French as in English our author would feel at
33624,FH₃.,liberty to adapt the form to the rhyme or metre: so we have ‘sa joye
33625,FH₃.,"soverein’ _Mir._ 4810, but ‘ma sovereine joie’ _Bal._ ix. 7."

33640,LIB. III.,
33641,LIB. III.,"143 ff. The story is from Ovid, _Her. Ep._ xi. It is that which is"
33642,LIB. III.,"referred to by Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, B 77,"
33643,LIB. III.,
33644,LIB. III.,‘But certeinly no word ne writeth he
33645,LIB. III.,"Of thilke wikke ensample of Canacee,"
33646,LIB. III.,That loved hir owene brother synfully.’
33647,LIB. III.,
33648,LIB. III.,(Note that the name ‘Canace’ is used by Gower so as to rhyme with
33649,LIB. III.,‘place.’)
33650,LIB. III.,
33651,LIB. III.,"In spite of the character of the subject, it must be allowed that Gower"
33652,LIB. III.,"tells the story in a very touching manner, and he shows good taste in"
33653,LIB. III.,"omitting some of Ovid’s details, as for example those in _Ep._ 39-44."
33654,LIB. III.,"The appeal of Canace to her father as given by Gower is original, and"
33655,LIB. III.,so for the most part is the letter to her brother and the picturesque
33656,LIB. III.,and pathetic scene of her death. On the whole this must be regarded as
33657,LIB. III.,a case in which our author has greatly improved upon his authority.
33658,LIB. III.,Lydgate obviously has Gower’s story before him when he introduces
33659,LIB. III.,the tale (quite needlessly) into his _Fall of Princes_. It may be
33660,LIB. III.,noted that in Ovid also the catastrophe is given as a consequence of
33661,LIB. III.,ungoverned anger:
33662,LIB. III.,
33663,LIB. III.,"‘Imperat, heu! ventis, tumidae non imperat irae.’"
33664,LIB. III.,
33665,LIB. III.,172. _lawe positif_: see note on Prol. 247. Gower’s view is that there
33666,LIB. III.,"is nothing naturally immoral about an incestuous marriage, but that it"
33667,LIB. III.,is made wrong by the ‘lex positiva’ of the Church. This position he
33668,LIB. III.,"makes clear at the beginning of the eighth book, by showing that in"
33669,LIB. III.,the first ages of the world such marriages must have been sanctioned
33670,LIB. III.,"by divine authority, and that the idea of kinship as a bar to marriage"
33671,LIB. III.,"had grown up gradually, cousins being allowed to marry among the Jews,"
33672,LIB. III.,"though brother and sister might not, and that finally the Church had"
33673,LIB. III.,"ordered,"
33674,LIB. III.,
33675,LIB. III.,‘That non schal wedden of his ken
33676,LIB. III.,Ne the seconde ne the thridde.’ viii. 147 f.
33677,LIB. III.,
33678,LIB. III.,"If attacked by Chaucer with regard to the subject of this story, he"
33679,LIB. III.,would no doubt defend himself by arguing that the vice with which it
33680,LIB. III.,"dealt was not against nature, and that the erring brother and sister"
33681,LIB. III.,were in truth far more deserving of sympathy than the father who
33682,LIB. III.,took such cruel vengeance. Notwithstanding his general strictness
33683,LIB. III.,"in matters of morality, Gower was something of a fatalist, cp. the"
33684,LIB. III.,"recurring phrases of 1222, 1348, 1677, iv. 1524, &c., and he repeatedly"
33685,LIB. III.,emphasizes the irresistible character of the impulses of nature in
33686,LIB. III.,"love; cp. i. 17 ff., 1051 ff., 2621, vi. 1261 ff., and here l. 161"

33696,LIB. III.,in Ovid is mainly narrative.
33697,LIB. III.,
33698,LIB. III.,292. _If that_ &c. The point of this as it occurs in Ovid depends upon
33699,LIB. III.,"the fact that her child has already been exposed and, as she conceives,"
33700,LIB. III.,"torn by wild beasts, and she entreats her brother if possible to"
33701,LIB. III.,"collect his remains and lay them by her,--a very natural and pathetic"
33702,LIB. III.,request. Gower has chosen for the sake of picturesque effect in this
33703,LIB. III.,scene to make the exposure of the child come after the death of the
33704,LIB. III.,"mother, and he should therefore perhaps have omitted the reference to"
33705,LIB. III.,the child’s burial.

33719,LIB. III.,
33720,LIB. III.,355. The revision of this line for the third recension may indicate
33721,LIB. III.,a preference for throwing back the accent of ‘nature’ in the English
33722,LIB. III.,"fashion: so ii. 1376, but ‘natúre’ ll. 175, 350."
33723,LIB. III.,
33724,LIB. III.,"361 ff. This is from Ovid, _Met._ iii. 324 ff. Gower has chosen to omit"
33725,LIB. III.,"the sequel of the story, which was that after seven years Tiresias saw"
33726,LIB. III.,"the same snakes again, and by striking them a second time recovered his"
33727,LIB. III.,"former sex. This being so, he is obliged to make a separate story (736"
33728,LIB. III.,"ff.) of the dispute between Jupiter and Juno, which gave Ovid occasion"

33758,LIB. III.,
33759,LIB. III.,"515. _balketh._ A ‘balk’ is a ridge left unploughed, and ‘to balk’"
33760,LIB. III.,in ploughing is to leave a ridge either between two furrows or in
33761,LIB. III.,"the furrow itself, the plough being permitted to pass over a piece"
33762,LIB. III.,of ground without breaking it. Here it is referred to as an accident
33763,LIB. III.,arising either from not ploughing straight or not keeping the
33764,LIB. III.,ploughshare regularly at the proper depth. From this idea of leaving
33765,LIB. III.,out something come most of the other meanings of the verb: see _New
33766,LIB. III.,Engl. Dict._
33767,LIB. III.,
33768,LIB. III.,544. _Hire oghte noght be._ For this impersonal use with the simple

33772,LIB. III.,
33773,LIB. III.,"585. This expression, which Pauli for some reason calls an ‘obscene"
33774,LIB. III.,"proverb,’ seems to be nearly equivalent to the saying about the bird"
33775,LIB. III.,"that fouls his own nest (cp. _Mirour_, 23413), and refers apparently to"
33776,LIB. III.,"recriminations between the owl and the stock upon which he sits, on the"
33777,LIB. III.,matter of cleanliness. The application is to the case of the man who
33778,LIB. III.,"quarrels with his own performances, and naturally has the worst of it"
33779,LIB. III.,himself.
33780,LIB. III.,
33781,LIB. III.,"626. ‘World’ seems to be the true reading here, though ‘word’ stood in"
33782,LIB. III.,the earlier form of text. The meaning is ‘that state of things shall
33783,LIB. III.,never be permitted by me.’ The use of ‘world’ is like that which we
33784,LIB. III.,"have in i. 178, where ‘mi world’ means ‘my condition’: cp. Prol. 383,"
33785,LIB. III.,1081. The verb ‘asterte’ is used in the sense of escaping notice and so
33786,LIB. III.,"being allowed to pass or to happen: cp. i. 1934,"
33787,LIB. III.,
33788,LIB. III.,"‘Bot that ne schal me noght asterte,"
33789,LIB. III.,"To wene forto be worthi,’ &c."
33790,LIB. III.,
33791,LIB. III.,Cp. i. 722.
33792,LIB. III.,
33793,LIB. III.,The expression ‘that word schal me nevere asterte’ is a more ordinary
33794,LIB. III.,"one (and therefore more likely to have been introduced by a copyist),"
33795,LIB. III.,but it gives no satisfactory sense here.
33796,LIB. III.,
33797,LIB. III.,"641 ff. The story was a hackneyed one, and occurs in many places. It is"

33813,LIB. III.,"referred to above, 361 ff. The point of the incident as told by Ovid is"
33814,LIB. III.,"(perhaps purposely) missed by Gower, who does not mention the reason"

33844,LIB. III.,"973 ff. This story may be found in Benoît’s _Roman de Troie_, 27551"
33845,LIB. III.,"ff. and in Guido, lib. 32 (n 3 v^o, ed. Argent.). We must note however"
33846,LIB. III.,"that for the classical Nauplius we find in Gower ‘Namplus,’ whereas in"
33847,LIB. III.,Benoît and Guido both it is ‘Naulus’: therefore it would seem that our
33848,LIB. III.,"author had before him also some other form of the story, where he found"
33849,LIB. III.,"the name ‘Nauplius’ or ‘Nauplus,’ which he read ‘Nanplus’ or ‘Namplus.’"
33850,LIB. III.,"Perhaps this may have been Hyginus, _Fab._ cxvi. Elsewhere Gower"
33851,LIB. III.,"usually follows Benoît rather than Guido, but here several expressions"
33852,LIB. III.,occur which seem to be suggested by Guido’s form of the story: see
33853,LIB. III.,notes on 1030 and 1063. Also Gower says nothing of the incident of
33854,LIB. III.,"rocks being hurled down on the Greeks (_Rom. de Troie_, 27795 ff.),"
33855,LIB. III.,which is also omitted by Guido.
33856,LIB. III.,
33857,LIB. III.,"1002. The name which appears here and in the Latin margin as ‘Namplus,’"
33858,LIB. III.,"with no important variation of reading, is quite clearly ‘Nauplus’ in"
33859,LIB. III.,iv. 1816 ff.

33875,LIB. III.,"1065. ‘what’ for ‘war,’ which appears in the unrevised form of the"
33876,LIB. III.,"first recension, must be an error of the original scribe: on the other"
33877,LIB. III.,"hand, ‘tyme’ for ‘dai’ proceeded no doubt originally from the author"
33878,LIB. III.,and was altered in order to make the verse run more smoothly.
33879,LIB. III.,
33880,LIB. III.,
33881,LIB. III.,_Latin Verses._ iv. 1. _et sit spiritus eius Naribus_: a reference to
33882,LIB. III.,"Isaiah ii. 22, ‘Quiescite ergo ab homine, cuius spiritus in naribus"
33883,LIB. III.,"eius est.’ The same passage is quoted in _Mirour_, 4754, and it is"
33884,LIB. III.,evident there that the ‘breath in the nostrils’ was understood by our
33885,LIB. III.,author to stand for fury of anger.

33891,LIB. III.,and Will and Hope on the other is quite in the style of the _Roman de
33892,LIB. III.,"la Rose_, where Reason and the Lover have an endless controversy (2983"
33893,LIB. III.,"ff.). Though the agencies are clearly personified here, the author has"
33894,LIB. III.,not assigned capital letters to their names.

33899,LIB. III.,"The first reading was ‘champartie,’ which may have proceeded from the"
33900,LIB. III.,author. It is clear that this word was used by Lydgate in the sense
33901,LIB. III.,"of ‘rivalry’ or ‘contest’ in the phrase ‘holde champartie,’ and this"
33902,LIB. III.,"may either have come from the idea of partnership, implying division"
33903,LIB. III.,"of power and so rivalry, as in Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, A 1949, or"
33904,LIB. III.,"from the legal sense, with which Gower and Lydgate would doubtless be"
33905,LIB. III.,"acquainted, meaning partnership for a contentious purpose. There seems"
33906,LIB. III.,no sufficient reason for supposing (with the _New Engl. Dict._) that
33907,LIB. III.,Lydgate’s use was founded on a misunderstanding of Chaucer.
33908,LIB. III.,
33909,LIB. III.,1183. _and til._ Caxton and Berthelet both have ‘tyl that’ for ‘and
33910,LIB. III.,"til,’ and one is tempted to suggest that ‘and til’ was meant to stand"
33911,LIB. III.,for ‘until.’
33912,LIB. III.,
33913,LIB. III.,1201 ff. The story of the visit of Alexander to Diogenes was a common
33914,LIB. III.,"one enough, and it is hardly worth while to investigate its source for"
33915,LIB. III.,"Gower. He probably here combined various materials into one narrative,"
33916,LIB. III.,"for the usual form of the story as given by Vincent of Beauvais, _Spec."
33917,LIB. III.,"Hist._ iii. 68 f., and in the _Gesta Romanorum_, does not include the"
33918,LIB. III.,conversation about the Reason and the Will. This may have been derived
33919,LIB. III.,"from Walter Burley, _De Vita Philosophorum_, cap. l., ‘Dum Alexander"
33920,LIB. III.,"rex coram Diogene transiret, Diogenes tanquam illum spernens non"
33921,LIB. III.,"respexit; cui dixit Alexander, “Quid est Diogenes quod me non respicis,"
33922,LIB. III.,"quasi mei non indigeas?” Cui ille, “Ad quid necesse habeo servi"
33923,LIB. III.,"servorum meorum?” Et Alexander, “Numquid servorum tuorum servus sum?”"
33924,LIB. III.,"Ait, “Ego prevaleo cupiditatibus meis refrenans illas et subiciens"
33925,LIB. III.,"mihi illas ut serviant: tibi autem cupiditates prevalent, et servus"
33926,LIB. III.,"earum efficeris, earum obtemperans iussioni: servus igitur es servorum"
33927,LIB. III.,meorum.”’ Burley gives the other part of the conversation separately.
33928,LIB. III.,
33929,LIB. III.,The incident of the messenger sent to inquire and of the answer which
33930,LIB. III.,"he brought back is no doubt due to Gower, as also the idea of the ‘tun’"
33931,LIB. III.,being set on an axle and adapted for astronomical observations.
33932,LIB. III.,
33933,LIB. III.,1212. The ‘dolium’ was of course popularly regarded as a wooden cask.

33939,LIB. III.,
33940,LIB. III.,"1310. _to schifte_, ‘to dispose of.’ In Burley, ‘rogo ne auferas quod"
33941,LIB. III.,dare non potes.’
33942,LIB. III.,
33943,LIB. III.,"1331 ff. The tale of Pyramus and Thisbe is from Ovid, _Met._ iv."
33944,LIB. III.,55-166. Chaucer has taken it from the same source in the _Legend of
33945,LIB. III.,"Good Women_. When we compare the results, we find that in this instance"
33946,LIB. III.,"it is Chaucer who has followed his authority closely, while Gower gives"
33947,LIB. III.,a paraphrase in his own language and with several variations of detail.
33948,LIB. III.,"He says, for example, that the lovers themselves made the hole in the"
33949,LIB. III.,wall through which they conversed; he omits Ninus’ tomb; he speaks
33950,LIB. III.,"of a lion, not a lioness; he says that Thisbe hid herself in a bush"
33951,LIB. III.,"(not a cave), and that then the lion slew and devoured a beast before"
33952,LIB. III.,drinking at the spring; he cuts short the speech of Pyramus before
33953,LIB. III.,killing himself; he represents that Pyramus was slain at once instead
33954,LIB. III.,of living until Thisbe came; he invents an entirely new speech for
33955,LIB. III.,"Thisbe; and he judiciously omits, as Chaucer does also, the mention of"
33956,LIB. III.,the mulberry-tree and its transformation.
33957,LIB. III.,
33958,LIB. III.,"In short, Gower writes apparently from a general recollection of the"
33959,LIB. III.,"story, while Chaucer evidently has his Ovid before him and endeavours"
33960,LIB. III.,"to translate almost every phrase, showing thereby his good taste, for"
33961,LIB. III.,Ovid tells the story well.
33962,LIB. III.,
33963,LIB. III.,The following points in Ovid (among others) are reproduced by Chaucer
33964,LIB. III.,"and not by Gower: l. 56, ‘quas Oriens habuit’; 58, ‘Coctilibus"
33965,LIB. III.,"muris’; 59, ‘Notitiam primosque gradus vicinia fecit’ (which Chaucer"
33966,LIB. III.,"misunderstands, however); 62, ‘Ex aequo captis ’ &c.; 64, ‘Quoque"
33967,LIB. III.,"magis tegitur, tectus magis aestuat ignis’; 65, ‘Fissus erat tenui"
33968,LIB. III.,"rima,’ &c.; 68, ‘Quid non sentit amor?’; 73-77, the speeches of the"
33969,LIB. III.,"lovers to the wall; 81 f., ‘Postera nocturnos aurora’ &c.; 85, ‘Fallere"
33970,LIB. III.,"custodes’; 87, ‘Neve sit errandum’ &c.; 94, ‘adopertaque vultum’; 97,"

33972,LIB. III.,"in alto Pulvere’ &c.; 108, ‘Una duos nox, inquit, perdet amantes,’"
33973,LIB. III.,"and the rest of this speech; 117 f., ‘Utque dedit notae lacrimas,’"
33974,LIB. III.,"&c.; 122, ‘Non aliter quam cum vitiato fistula plumbo Scinditur’;"
33975,LIB. III.,"130, ‘Quantaque vitarit narrare pericula gestit’; 133, ‘tremebunda"
33976,LIB. III.,"videt pulsare cruentum Membra solum’; 134 f., ‘oraque buxo’ &c.; 140,"
33977,LIB. III.,"‘Vulnera supplevit’ &c.; 145, ‘oculos iam morte gravatos’; 148 ff., the"
33978,LIB. III.,"speech of Thisbe, except the reference to the mulberry-tree."
33979,LIB. III.,
33980,LIB. III.,"Gower’s rendering of the story is inferior to that of Chaucer, as might"
33981,LIB. III.,"be expected, but nevertheless it is simple and pathetic. It has even"
33982,LIB. III.,"some points of superiority, as 1386 f., the passage of Thisbe through"
33983,LIB. III.,"the town at night; 1400, ‘with his blodi snoute’; 1411, the terror"
33984,LIB. III.,"of Thisbe when concealed in the bush; and finally 1486 ff., where"
33985,LIB. III.,instead of deliberately resolving on death and inflicting it with calm
33986,LIB. III.,"resolution, she is more naturally represented as overcome by a sudden"
33987,LIB. III.,impulse in the midst of her mourning and killing herself almost without
33988,LIB. III.,consciousness of what she did.
33989,LIB. III.,
33990,LIB. III.,"1348. _as it scholde be_: cp. 1222, ‘As thing which scholde so betyde.’"
33991,LIB. III.,

33993,LIB. III.,"distinction, however, between ‘miht’ (= mayest) and ‘mihte’ is usually"
33994,LIB. III.,well preserved by our author.

34048,LIB. III.,"1757 ff. This story is chiefly from Benoît, _Roman de Troie_, 28025"
34049,LIB. III.,ff. Guido omits many details which are given by Gower. Note that in
34050,LIB. III.,"l. 28025, where Joly’s edition has ‘Samas,’ Guido and Gower both have"
34051,LIB. III.,‘Athemas.’ Our author has treated his materials freely and tells the
34052,LIB. III.,story at greater length. The speech which he assigns to Nestor is for
34053,LIB. III.,the most part original.
34054,LIB. III.,
34055,LIB. III.,"1885 ff. The tale of Orestes is from Benoît de Sainte-More, _Rom. de"
34056,LIB. III.,"Troie_, 27925-27990, 28155-28283, and 28339-28402. Guido omits the"
34057,LIB. III.,"visit of Orestes to Athens to obtain help for his expedition, the"
34058,LIB. III.,"portion of the oracle which bad him tear away his mother’s breasts,"
34059,LIB. III.,"and the name of Menetius (or Menesteus), who defended Orestes, and"
34060,LIB. III.,Gower’s details are in general more in accordance with those of Benoît.
34061,LIB. III.,"A few exceptions may be found, however. For example, Gower says that"
34062,LIB. III.,"Agamemnon was murdered as he lay in bed (1915), Guido, ‘dum suo"
34063,LIB. III.,"soporatus dormiret in lecto,’ but Benoît only, ‘L’ont la premiere nuit"
34064,LIB. III.,"ocis.’ Again, Guido calls Idomeneus ‘consanguineum eius,’ and Gower"
34065,LIB. III.,"says, ‘So as he was of his lignage,’ of which Benoît says nothing. No"
34066,LIB. III.,"doubt Gower was acquainted with both, and preferred the French because"
34067,LIB. III.,he perceived it to be better.
34068,LIB. III.,
34069,LIB. III.,1911. ‘To set her love in place where it cannot be secure.’
34070,LIB. III.,
34071,LIB. III.,2022 f. _Cropheon ... Phoieus._ The names are given as ‘Trofion’
34072,LIB. III.,"and ‘Florentes’ by Benoît (Joly’s text), ‘Troiesem’ (‘Croeze’"
34073,LIB. III.,MS.) and ‘Forensis’ by Guido. They are originally derived from a
34074,LIB. III.,"misunderstanding of a passage in Dictys, _Bell. Troi._ vi. 3, ‘armatus"
34075,LIB. III.,"cum praedicta manu ad Strophium venit: is namque Phocensis, cuius"
34076,LIB. III.,"filia,’ &c."
34077,LIB. III.,
34078,LIB. III.,2055 ff. This speech is introduced by Gower.

34086,LIB. III.,
34087,LIB. III.,2145. _Menesteüs._ This is a more correct form of the name than the
34088,LIB. III.,"‘Menetius,’ which we have in Joly’s text of Benoît."
34089,LIB. III.,
34090,LIB. III.,2148. _of the goddes bede._ Here we perhaps have Guido rather than
34091,LIB. III.,Benoît.
34092,LIB. III.,
34093,LIB. III.,"2173. _Egiona._ The name is properly Erigona, and so it is given by"
34094,LIB. III.,"Benoît. The moralization on her fate, 2183 ff., is due to our author,"
34095,LIB. III.,"and it is rather out of place, considering the circumstances of the"
34096,LIB. III.,story.
34097,LIB. III.,
34098,LIB. III.,"2346. _the trew man._ In F we have ‘trew,’ altered apparently from"
34099,LIB. III.,"‘trewe,’ which is the usual and the more correct form: ‘the trew man to"
34100,LIB. III.,the plowh’ means the labourer who truly serves the plough.
34101,LIB. III.,
34102,LIB. III.,"2358. This is simply a repetition of 2355, ‘thei stonde of on acord.’"
34103,LIB. III.,‘As of corage’ means as regards their feeling or inclination: for this

34109,LIB. III.,
34110,LIB. III.,2424 f. ‘that men set their hearts to make gain by such wrong doing.’
34111,LIB. III.,
34112,LIB. III.,"2451. _homward_, i.e. ‘going homeward.’ The word included something of"
34113,LIB. III.,"a verbal sense, as we see in i. 938, iii. 1021: so also ‘toward’ in l."
34114,LIB. III.,2643.
34115,LIB. III.,
34116,LIB. III.,2458. _the world mistimed._ The verb ‘mistime’ means properly ‘to
34117,LIB. III.,"happen amiss,’ with the suggestion that it is by the fault of the"
34118,LIB. III.,person concerned. Gower uses it here transitively for ‘to manage
34119,LIB. III.,"amiss,’ while in vi. 4 ‘was mystymed’ means ‘came unhappily about.’"
34120,LIB. III.,
34121,LIB. III.,2508. _what man ... rede_: for the subjunctive see note on Prol. 460.
34122,LIB. III.,
34123,LIB. III.,2536. ‘Hardly have any fear’: see note on ii. 2124.
34124,LIB. III.,
34125,LIB. III.,"2555. Acastus was king of Iolcos. He purified Peleus, as some say of"
34126,LIB. III.,"the murder of Eurytion, but according to others of that of Phocus:"
34127,LIB. III.,"cp. Bocc. _Gen. Deorum_, xii. 50, ‘ad Magnetas abiit, ubi ab Achasto"
34128,LIB. III.,fraterna caede purgatus est.’

34130,LIB. III.,"2563 f. Alcmaeon, son of Amphiaraus, was purified by Achelous, whom our"
34131,LIB. III.,author here takes for a priest.
34132,LIB. III.,
34133,LIB. III.,"2599 ff. This anecdote is told also in the _Mirour_, 5029-5040, and"
34134,LIB. III.,"there also it is ascribed to Solinus. I do not find it, however, in his"
34135,LIB. III.,book.
34136,LIB. III.,
34137,LIB. III.,2608 ff. For the irregularity of this sentence cp. 1593 ff.
34138,LIB. III.,
34139,LIB. III.,"2639 ff. The story is taken from Benoît _(Rom. de Troie_, 6497-6590),"
34140,LIB. III.,"as we may see at once from the name ‘Theucer,’ which Guido gives"
34141,LIB. III.,"rather more correctly as ‘Theutran.’ Also ll. 2674-2680, _Roman de"
34142,LIB. III.,"Troie_, 6545-6553, have nothing corresponding to them in Guido. Guido"
34143,LIB. III.,"here certainly referred to a copy of the so-called Dares, where the"
34144,LIB. III.,name occurs in its classical form ‘Teuthras.’ He is particularly
34145,LIB. III.,"interested in the story on local grounds, being concerned to show"
34146,LIB. III.,that the ‘Messe’ which he found in Benoît might be connected with the
34147,LIB. III.,"name of his place of residence, Messina, and that the events related"
34148,LIB. III.,occurred actually in Sicily. Accordingly he speaks of certain columns
34149,LIB. III.,"popularly called ‘columns of Hercules,’ which existed in his own time"
34150,LIB. III.,"in Sicily, ‘ex parte Barbarorum,’ i.e. on the south coast, and takes"
34151,LIB. III.,"them as evidence of the connexion of Hercules with the island, and"
34152,LIB. III.,hence of the probability that this story (which in the original has to
34153,LIB. III.,"do with Hercules, though Gower has excluded him from it) had its scene"
34154,LIB. III.,"in Sicily. Dares, he admits, says nothing of this, and his reference"
34155,LIB. III.,"to Dares is here in more precise form than usual, ‘in suo codice’"
34156,LIB. III.,"according to the Bodleian MS., though the printed editions give ‘in suo"
34157,LIB. III.,"opere’ (MS. Add. A. 365, f. 50 v^o)."
34158,LIB. III.,
34159,LIB. III.,"He says of the place where these columns are, ‘qui locus dicitur adhuc"
34160,LIB. III.,"columpnarum,’ and adds that the emperor Frederic II has established"
34161,LIB. III.,"a town there, and that the place is now called ‘terra nova.’ This is"
34162,LIB. III.,"obviously identical with the modern Terranova, founded by Frederic"
34163,LIB. III.,II near the site of the ancient Gela. It seems probable that Guido
34164,LIB. III.,may have been himself a native of this place or of its immediate
34165,LIB. III.,"neighbourhood, and that he chose to call himself after its former"
34166,LIB. III.,"designation, ‘Columpna’ or ‘Columpnae,’ instead of by the new name"
34167,LIB. III.,which had come into use during his own lifetime[AN].
34168,LIB. III.,
34169,LIB. III.,2643. _His Sone._ This is a mistake on the part of Gower. Both Benoît
34170,LIB. III.,"and Guido state quite clearly that Telephus was the son of Hercules,"
34171,LIB. III.,and that it was to Hercules that the obligation was due which is
34172,LIB. III.,referred to in 2690 ff. Perhaps the copy of the _Roman de Troie_ which
34173,LIB. III.,Gower used had ‘Thelefus fu filz Achilles’ for ‘Thelefus fu filz
34174,LIB. III.,"Hercules,’ in l. 6506."
34175,LIB. III.,
34176,LIB. III.,2756. We should rather have expected ‘That I fro you wol nothing hele.’

34188,LIB. IV.,the _Mirour_ as ‘au fin.’
34189,LIB. IV.,
34190,LIB. IV.,77 ff. The only definite indication of sources here is the reference
34191,LIB. IV.,"(such as it is) to Ovid, _Her. Ep._ vii., contained in ll. 104-115."

34193,LIB. IV.,"92. _as it be scholde_, cp. iii. 1348."
34194,LIB. IV.,
34195,LIB. IV.,104 ff. This picture seems to be constructed partly from a misreading
34196,LIB. IV.,"or misunderstanding of Ovid, _Her. Ep._ vii. 1 f.,"
34197,LIB. IV.,
34198,LIB. IV.,"‘Sic ubi fata vocant, udis abiectus in herbis"
34199,LIB. IV.,Ad vada Maeandri concinit albus olor.’
34200,LIB. IV.,
34201,LIB. IV.,"It is difficult to see how our author translated these lines, but the"
34202,LIB. IV.,"result, which must have been chiefly due to his imagination, is rather"
34203,LIB. IV.,creditable to him. Chaucer gives the true sense in the _Legend of Good
34204,LIB. IV.,"Women_, 1355 ff.,"
34205,LIB. IV.,
34206,LIB. IV.,"‘Ryght so,’ quod she, ‘as that the white swan"

34212,LIB. IV.,"137. That is, to put all the slothful in mind (of their duty)."
34213,LIB. IV.,
34214,LIB. IV.,147 ff. The general idea of this is taken from the letter of Penelope
34215,LIB. IV.,"to Ulysses, Ovid, _Her. Ep._ i, but this is not closely followed in"
34216,LIB. IV.,"details, and it will be noticed that Gower represents the letter as"
34217,LIB. IV.,"sent while the siege of Troy still continued, and apparently he knows"
34218,LIB. IV.,nothing of the great length of the wandering afterwards: cp. 226 ff.
34219,LIB. IV.,
34220,LIB. IV.,"170. The reading ‘Had’ for ‘Hath’ is given by many MSS., including F."
34221,LIB. IV.,"We find ‘Hath’ in the following, H₁C, SAdTΔ, W, and it must certainly"
34222,LIB. IV.,be the true reading.

34227,LIB. IV.,"earned for him, as for his contemporary Roger Bacon, the character of"
34228,LIB. IV.,a student of magic. In the metrical life of Grosteste by Robert of
34229,LIB. IV.,"Bardney (Wharton, _Anglia Sacra_, i. 333) one chapter is ‘De aeneo"
34230,LIB. IV.,capite quod Oxoniae fecit Grosthede ad dubia quaeque determinanda.’
34231,LIB. IV.,This author says only that by some accident the head fell and was

34266,LIB. IV.,"‘sullen’ report as hardly to be found in French, occurs repeatedly"
34267,LIB. IV.,"in the _Mirour de l’omme_ in the sense of ‘alone,’ ‘lonely.’ For the"
34268,LIB. IV.,meaning here assigned to it we may compare the modern use of the
34269,LIB. IV.,"word ‘singular,’ which in Gower’s French meant ‘lonely.’ There is no"
34270,LIB. IV.,"authority for Pauli’s reading ‘solempne,’ and it gives neither sense"

34276,LIB. IV.,453 ff. The authority of the MSS. is strongly in favour of ‘grete:
34277,LIB. IV.,"lete’ in these lines, and this reading is certainly right. We must"
34278,LIB. IV.,take ‘lete’ as the past participle of the strong verb ‘leten’ (from
34279,LIB. IV.,"‘lǣtan’), meaning ‘leave,’ ‘omit,’ and ‘grete’ as accommodated to the"
34280,LIB. IV.,"rhyme. The negative construction following rather suggests ‘let,’"
34281,LIB. IV.,"meaning ‘hindered’ as ii. 128 ff., but the rhyme ‘let: gret’ would be"
34282,LIB. IV.,an impossible one. See note on i. 3365 and cp. l. 1153.

34308,LIB. IV.,"there was probably some other source, for our author would not find"
34309,LIB. IV.,anything in Ovid about the transformation into a tree. Many of the
34310,LIB. IV.,"details seem to be of his own invention, and he is probably responsible"
34311,LIB. IV.,for the variation which makes the visit of Demophon to Thrace take
34312,LIB. IV.,place on the way to Troy instead of on the return. Chaucer’s form of
34313,LIB. IV.,the story in the _Legend of Good Women_ is quite different.

34325,LIB. IV.,
34326,LIB. IV.,"787 ff. Except the idea of a letter being sent, Gower takes little here"
34327,LIB. IV.,from Ovid.
34328,LIB. IV.,
34329,LIB. IV.,"816 ff. This passage seems mostly of Gower’s invention, partly perhaps"
34330,LIB. IV.,"on the suggestion of the story of Hero and Leander in Ovid, _Her. Ep._"
34331,LIB. IV.,"xix. 33 ff. See Bech in _Anglia_, v. 347."
34332,LIB. IV.,
34333,LIB. IV.,"_do set up._ Apparently ‘set’ is the participle, cp. ii. 1799."
34334,LIB. IV.,
34335,LIB. IV.,"833. _al hire one._ This idea is emphasized by Ovid, _Rem. Am._ 591 f."
34336,LIB. IV.,
34337,LIB. IV.,"869. This piece of etymology is perhaps due to our author, who usually"
34338,LIB. IV.,adds something of his own to the stories of transformation which he
34339,LIB. IV.,relates; see note on i. 2355. Lydgate says that Phyllis hanged herself
34340,LIB. IV.,"upon a filbert-tree, but he perhaps took the notion from Gower:"
34341,LIB. IV.,
34342,LIB. IV.,‘Upon the walles depeint men myght se
34343,LIB. IV.,Hou she was honged upon a filbert tre.’

34350,LIB. IV.,
34351,LIB. IV.,"‘Lors est il sage apres la mein,’"
34352,LIB. IV.,
34353,LIB. IV.,of which this line is an exact reproduction.
34354,LIB. IV.,
34355,LIB. IV.,904. _pleith an aftercast._ This looks like a metaphor from casting
34356,LIB. IV.,"dice, but it is difficult to see the exact application. It means of"
34357,LIB. IV.,course here that he is always too late in what he says and does.
34358,LIB. IV.,
34359,LIB. IV.,"914. _come at thin above_, i.e. attain to success: cp. _Mirour_, 25350,"

34364,LIB. IV.,
34365,LIB. IV.,"979 ff. The story may probably enough be taken from Ovid, _Metam._ ii."

34367,LIB. IV.,
34368,LIB. IV.,"_which is the Sonne hote_, ‘which is called the Sun’; cp. ii. 131"
34369,LIB. IV.,"f. Possibly, however, ‘hote’ may be the adjective, with definite"
34370,LIB. IV.,termination for the sake of the rhyme. There would be no objection to
34371,LIB. IV.,rhyming with it the adverb of the same form.
34372,LIB. IV.,
34373,LIB. IV.,1030 ff. The moral drawn by Gower from the story of Phaeton is against
34374,LIB. IV.,"going too low, that is abandoning the higher concerns of love owing"
34375,LIB. IV.,to slothful negligence. The next story is against aiming too high and
34376,LIB. IV.,neglecting the due claims of service.

34382,LIB. IV.,1096. _who as evere take_: so ‘what man’ is very commonly used with
34383,LIB. IV.,"subjunctive, iii. 2508 &c., but the uncertainty of the construction is"
34384,LIB. IV.,"shown by ‘And thinkth’ in the next line. See notes on Prol. 13, 460."
34385,LIB. IV.,
34386,LIB. IV.,"1108 ff. Cp. _Mirour_, 5395 ff."
34387,LIB. IV.,
34388,LIB. IV.,"1131. A superfluous syllable, such as we have at the pause in this"
34389,LIB. IV.,"line, is very unusual in Gower’s verse; but cp. v. 447."
34390,LIB. IV.,
34391,LIB. IV.,"1153. _lete I ne mai_, ‘I may not neglect’: see note on i. 3365."
34392,LIB. IV.,
34393,LIB. IV.,"1180. Cp. i. 698, ‘And many a contenance he piketh.’ It means here"
34394,LIB. IV.,perhaps ‘thus I keep up a pretence (for staying).’
34395,LIB. IV.,
34396,LIB. IV.,1245 ff. A somewhat similar story to this is to be found in Andreas
34397,LIB. IV.,"Capellanus, _De Amore_, to which my attention was first called by Mr."
34398,LIB. IV.,Archer. This book (written about 1220) gives imaginary colloquies
34399,LIB. IV.,"between different kinds of persons, to illustrate the ways of"
34400,LIB. IV.,"courtship, ‘Plebeius loquitur plebeiae,’ ‘Plebeius nobili,’ ‘Nobilis"
34401,LIB. IV.,"plebeiae,’ ‘Nobilis nobili.’ In this last occurs the story of a"
34402,LIB. IV.,squire who saw the god of love leading a great company of ladies in
34403,LIB. IV.,"three bands, the first well mounted and well attended, the second"
34404,LIB. IV.,well mounted but attended by so many that it was a hindrance rather
34405,LIB. IV.,"than a help, and the third in wretched array with lame horses and no"
34406,LIB. IV.,attendance. The meaning of the sight is explained to the squire by
34407,LIB. IV.,"one of these last, and he is taken to see the appropriate rewards and"
34408,LIB. IV.,punishments of each band. He relates what he has seen to his mistress
34409,LIB. IV.,"in order to make her more ready to accept his suit (pp. 91-108, ed."
34410,LIB. IV.,"Trojel, 1892)."
34411,LIB. IV.,
34412,LIB. IV.,"There are some expressions which resemble those which Gower uses, as"
34413,LIB. IV.,‘quarum quaelibet in equo _pinguissimo_ et formoso et _suavissime
34414,LIB. IV.,"ambulante_ sedebat’ (p. 92), cp. 1309 f.,"
34415,LIB. IV.,
34416,LIB. IV.,‘On faire amblende hors thei sete
34417,LIB. IV.,"That were al whyte, fatte and grete.’"
34418,LIB. IV.,
34419,LIB. IV.,"And again, ‘domina quaedam ... habens equum macerrimum et turpem et"
34420,LIB. IV.,"tribus pedibus claudicantem,’ cp. 1343 ff. The story, however, is"
34421,LIB. IV.,different in many ways from that of Gower. For other similar stories
34422,LIB. IV.,see the article in _Romania_ for January 1900 on the ‘Purgatory of
34423,LIB. IV.,Cruel Beauties’ by W. A. Neilson.
34424,LIB. IV.,
34425,LIB. IV.,"The tale of Rosiphelee is well told by Gower, and in more than one"
34426,LIB. IV.,passage it bears marks of having been carefully revised by the author.
34427,LIB. IV.,"The alteration of 1321 f. is peculiarly happy, and gives us one of the"
34428,LIB. IV.,best couplets in the _Confessio Amantis_.
34429,LIB. IV.,
34430,LIB. IV.,1285. _the Sonne Ariste_: cp. iii. 1224. The capital letter was perhaps
34431,LIB. IV.,intended to mark ‘Ariste’ as a substantive.
34432,LIB. IV.,
34433,LIB. IV.,1307. _comen ryde_: cp. i. 350.
34434,LIB. IV.,
34435,LIB. IV.,1309. ‘hors’ is evidently plural here: so i. 2036 and often.
34436,LIB. IV.,
34437,LIB. IV.,"1320. _long and smal_, i.e. tall and slender. Adjectives used"
34438,LIB. IV.,predicatively with a plural subject take the plural inflection or not
34439,LIB. IV.,according to convenience. Thus in Prol. 81 we have ‘Bot for my wittes
34440,LIB. IV.,ben to smale’ in rhyme with ‘tale.’
34441,LIB. IV.,
34442,LIB. IV.,"1323. _beere._ This is pret. plur., as 1376: the same form for pret."
34443,LIB. IV.,subj. 2749.
34444,LIB. IV.,
34445,LIB. IV.,"1330. _For pure abaissht_: cp. Chaucer, _Troilus_, ii. 656, ‘And"
34446,LIB. IV.,with that thought for pure ashamed she Gan in hir hed to pulle.’ The
34447,LIB. IV.,"parallel, to which my attention was called by Prof. M^cCormick,"
34448,LIB. IV.,"suggests the idea that ‘abaissht’ is a participle rather than a noun,"
34449,LIB. IV.,and the use of the past participle with ‘for’ in this manner occurs
34450,LIB. IV.,"several times in Lydgate, e.g. ‘for unknowe,’ ‘meaning from ignorance,’"
34451,LIB. IV.,"_Temple of Glas_, 632, ‘for astonied,’ 934, 1366, and so with an"
34452,LIB. IV.,"adjective, ‘for pure wood’ in the English _Rom. of the Rose_, 276. See"
34453,LIB. IV.,"Dr. Schick’s note on Lydgate, _Temple of Glas_, 632."
34454,LIB. IV.,
34455,LIB. IV.,"1422. _That I ne hadde_, ‘I would that I had’: cp. v. 3747,"

34457,LIB. IV.,"‘Ha lord, that he ne were alonde!’"
34458,LIB. IV.,
34459,LIB. IV.,‘to late war’ is in a kind of loose apposition to the subject.
34460,LIB. IV.,
34461,LIB. IV.,"1429. _swiche._ Rather perhaps ‘swich,’ as ii. 566 f., v. 377. Most"
34462,LIB. IV.,MSS. have ‘such.’
34463,LIB. IV.,
34464,LIB. IV.,1432 ff. _warneth ... bidd._ The singular of the imperative seems to be
34465,LIB. IV.,freely interchanged with the plural in this form of address.
34466,LIB. IV.,
34467,LIB. IV.,1454 (margin). The author dissociates himself personally from the
34468,LIB. IV.,"extreme doctrines enunciated in the text, as at first he took care to"
34469,LIB. IV.,remind his readers that the character of a lover was for him only an
34470,LIB. IV.,assumed one (i. 63 ff. margin).
34471,LIB. IV.,
34472,LIB. IV.,1490. _and longe er that sche changeth_ &c. This is a puzzling
34473,LIB. IV.,"sentence, and we are not helped by the punctuation of the MSS., which"
34474,LIB. IV.,for the most part have a stop after ‘herte.’ I can only suppose that
34475,LIB. IV.,it means ‘and is long before she changes her heart in her youth to
34476,LIB. IV.,"marriage.’ We can hardly make ‘longe’ a verb, ‘and may be eager until"
34477,LIB. IV.,"she changes,’ because of the lines which follow."
34478,LIB. IV.,
34479,LIB. IV.,1505 ff. Judges xi. Our author has expanded the story so far as regards
34480,LIB. IV.,"the mourning for the virginity of Jephthah’s daughter, that being the"
34481,LIB. IV.,point with which he was particularly concerned here.
34482,LIB. IV.,
34483,LIB. IV.,1516. ‘Whether it be of man or woman.’
34484,LIB. IV.,
34485,LIB. IV.,"1537 ff. In the original this is different, ‘Heu me, filia mea,"
34486,LIB. IV.,"decepisti me et ipsa decepta es: aperui enim os meum ad Dominum, et"
34487,LIB. IV.,aliud facere non potero.’ Gower deals freely here as elsewhere with the
34488,LIB. IV.,"narrative, especially in the matter of speeches."
34489,LIB. IV.,
34490,LIB. IV.,1563. _fourty daies_: in the original ‘duobus mensibus.’

34493,LIB. IV.,
34494,LIB. IV.,"1649. _as me thenketh ... That_, equivalent to ‘me thinketh ... That,’"
34495,LIB. IV.,either ‘as’ or ‘That’ being redundant.
34496,LIB. IV.,
34497,LIB. IV.,"1659. The best MSS. give ‘heþen’ here, not ‘heþene.’"
34498,LIB. IV.,
34499,LIB. IV.,"1693 ff. _Roman de Troie_, 18385 ff. In the medieval Tale of Troy it"
34500,LIB. IV.,is the love of Polyxena which serves as motive for the withdrawal of
34501,LIB. IV.,Achilles from the war.
34502,LIB. IV.,
34503,LIB. IV.,1723. _which I travaile fore._ We have here rather a remarkable
34504,LIB. IV.,"instance of emphasis thrown on the preposition, with a modification of"
34505,LIB. IV.,form for the sake of the rhyme: cp. ii. 565.
34506,LIB. IV.,
34507,LIB. IV.,"1741. _On whether bord_, i.e. on which tack: technical terms of the sea"
34508,LIB. IV.,"occur several times in the _Confessio Amantis_, e.g. v. 3119, 7048,"
34509,LIB. IV.,viii. 1983.
34510,LIB. IV.,
34511,LIB. IV.,1810. _made_: cp. Prol. 300.
34512,LIB. IV.,
34513,LIB. IV.,1815 ff. Gower seems to have dealt rather freely with this story. The
34514,LIB. IV.,"usual form of it gives Palamedes, not Nauplius, as the person who came"
34515,LIB. IV.,"to fetch Ulysses, and makes Ulysses yoke a horse and an ox together in"
34516,LIB. IV.,"a plough as a sign of madness: see Hyginus, _Fab._ xcv. As to the name"
34517,LIB. IV.,"of Nauplus, see notes on iii. 973, 1002."
34518,LIB. IV.,
34519,LIB. IV.,"1833. That is, ‘feigning to be mad,’ not ‘like one who feigns to be"
34520,LIB. IV.,mad’: see note on i. 695.
34521,LIB. IV.,
34522,LIB. IV.,"1847 ff. ‘He thought to try if he were mad or no, however it might"
34523,LIB. IV.,"please Ulysses,’ that is, whether it pleased him or not. ‘Hou’ seems to"
34524,LIB. IV.,be for ‘How so evere’: cp. l. 415.
34525,LIB. IV.,
34526,LIB. IV.,"1875. _tothe_, written so when the emphasis falls on the preposition,"

34551,LIB. IV.,"acknowledged to be the virtue opposed to Sloth, see _Mirour_, 10136"
34552,LIB. IV.,"&c., must show itself partly in the spirit of warlike boldness, ‘the"
34553,LIB. IV.,"corage of hardiesce,’ leading to such undertakings as those of which"
34554,LIB. IV.,the Lover had disputed the necessity.
34555,LIB. IV.,
34556,LIB. IV.,"2040. _And that_, i.e. ‘And as to that’: cp. Prol. 122."
34557,LIB. IV.,
34558,LIB. IV.,2045 ff. The fight between Hercules and Achelous is related in detail
34559,LIB. IV.,"by Ovid, _Metam._ ix. 31-88. Some parts of this seem to be reproduced"
34560,LIB. IV.,"by Gower, but the details are not very exactly copied. For the story"
34561,LIB. IV.,"generally he had some other authority, whence he got for example the"
34562,LIB. IV.,names ‘Oënes’ and ‘Calidoyne.’
34563,LIB. IV.,
34564,LIB. IV.,"It is to be noted that Gower gives ‘Achelons’ instead of Achelous, as"
34565,LIB. IV.,"he does also in the _Traitié_, vii. 5, where the story is shortly told"
34566,LIB. IV.,"in the same way as here, and there we find ‘Achelontis’ in the margin"
34567,LIB. IV.,as the genitive case. He ought to have been preserved from the mistake
34568,LIB. IV.,by the occurrence of the name in Ovid’s verse.
34569,LIB. IV.,
34570,LIB. IV.,"2054. For these two pillars cp. Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, B 3307 f., but"
34571,LIB. IV.,"Gower supposes them to have been both set up in the ‘desert of India,’"
34572,LIB. IV.,"‘El grant desert d’Ynde superiour’ as he has it in _Traitié_, vii. 1,"
34573,LIB. IV.,whereas according to Chaucer one was set up in the East and the other
34574,LIB. IV.,"in the West, to mark the extreme bounds of the world."
34575,LIB. IV.,
34576,LIB. IV.,"2123 f. Such forms of spelling as ‘sleighte,’ ‘heighte’ are unusual"
34577,LIB. IV.,"with our author, but cp. vii. 1121, 1227 f."
34578,LIB. IV.,
34579,LIB. IV.,2135. For the stories of ‘Pantasilee’ and Philemenis we may refer to
34580,LIB. IV.,"the _Roman de Troie_, 23283 ff. and 25663-25704."
34581,LIB. IV.,
34582,LIB. IV.,2200 ff. From this question arises the inevitable discussion of the
34583,LIB. IV.,"nature of ‘gentilesse’ and how far it depends upon birth, riches or"
34584,LIB. IV.,"personal merit. Gower accepts only the last qualification, and argues"
34585,LIB. IV.,"for it after the fashion of John Ball, though he was neither a Lollard"
34586,LIB. IV.,"nor a social revolutionist: cp. _Mirour_, 23389 ff. For the general"
34587,LIB. IV.,"subject cp. Dante, _Convito_, iv. 10, _Roman de la Rose_, 18807 ff."

34617,LIB. IV.,
34618,LIB. IV.,2410. _Termegis._ The word is a dissyllable for the metre. Probably
34619,LIB. IV.,"this name stands for Termegistus (i.e. Trismegistus), and in that case"
34620,LIB. IV.,we must throw the accent upon the final syllable and pass lightly over
34621,LIB. IV.,the preceding one.
34622,LIB. IV.,
34623,LIB. IV.,2418 ff. I suspect that ‘Poulins’ means Apollo or Apollinis: cp.

34691,LIB. IV.,"165, ‘he is one the truest mannered’). He takes ‘on’ in the sense of"

34693,LIB. IV.,"It is perhaps more likely that the usual explanation, which regards it"

34736,LIB. IV.,persons. There would have been reason to suspect this from the passage
34737,LIB. IV.,in the seventh book where he refers to the debate on the death sentence
34738,LIB. IV.,"of the Catiline conspirators, speaking of Tullius as his authority for"
34739,LIB. IV.,"the rules of rhetoric there illustrated, and ‘Cithero’ as the consul,"
34740,LIB. IV.,without any hint that they are the same person (vii. 1588 ff.). In
34741,LIB. IV.,Gower’s French works Tullius (Tulles) is the only name used. The form
34742,LIB. IV.,"Cithero (or Scithero) is used also by Chaucer, _Cant. Tales_, F 722."

34754,LIB. IV.,"meaning determined beforehand, as we see by the piece called _The"

34756,LIB. IV.,"For example, the throw of six, four and ace is there explained by the"

34774,LIB. IV.,
34775,LIB. IV.,2895 f. Apparently he means that his dreams were of no such harmless
34776,LIB. IV.,"things as sheep and their wool, or perhaps not of business matters,"
34777,LIB. IV.,alluding to wool as the staple of English commerce.

34784,LIB. IV.,

34788,LIB. IV.,"2927 ff. This is from Ovid, _Metam._ xi. 266-748, where the story"
34789,LIB. IV.,"is told at great length. Gower follows some parts of it, as the"
34790,LIB. IV.,"description of the House of Sleep and its surroundings, very closely."
34791,LIB. IV.,
34792,LIB. IV.,"Chaucer tells the story in the _Book of the Duchess_, but he has not"
34793,LIB. IV.,been so successful in reproducing it as Gower. It is here introduced
34794,LIB. IV.,"only as an illustration of the truth of dreams, but with its"
34795,LIB. IV.,description of the House of Sleep it is very appropriate also in other
34796,LIB. IV.,"respects to the subject of Somnolence, which is under discussion."
34797,LIB. IV.,
34798,LIB. IV.,"2928. _Trocinie_, from the adjective ‘Trachinia,’ in such expressions"

34800,LIB. IV.,
34801,LIB. IV.,2973. The reading of all the best MSS. in this line is ‘he’: (S however
34802,LIB. IV.,"is defective). We cannot doubt that the author meant to write ‘sche,’"
34803,LIB. IV.,for in what follows he regularly refers to Iris as female; but the
34804,LIB. IV.,"mistake apparently escaped his notice, and we must regard the reading"
34805,LIB. IV.,‘she’ in the two copies in which I have found it as an unauthorized
34806,LIB. IV.,"correction. Chaucer makes the messenger male, but does not name him."
34807,LIB. IV.,
34808,LIB. IV.,"2977-3055. This passage very happily follows Ovid, _Met._ xi. 589-645."
34809,LIB. IV.,"Our author gives all the essential features, but rearranges them freely"
34810,LIB. IV.,and adds details of his own.

34832,LIB. IV.,of ‘Phantasos.’
34833,LIB. IV.,
34834,LIB. IV.,3061 ff. Here Gower has made a real improvement in the story by
34835,LIB. IV.,"employing the two other ministers of Sleep, whose functions have been"
34836,LIB. IV.,"described, to represent the scene of the tempest and the wreck, while"
34837,LIB. IV.,Morpheus plays the part of Ceyx in the same scene. Ovid introduces the
34838,LIB. IV.,"characters of Icelos and Phantasos, but makes no use of them, sending"
34839,LIB. IV.,"Morpheus alone to relate what has taken place, instead of representing"
34840,LIB. IV.,"it in action, as it would more naturally appear in a dream."
34841,LIB. IV.,
34842,LIB. IV.,"3159. _mi herte_: more usually ‘min herte’ as 3139, and so generally"
34843,LIB. IV.,"before ‘h,’ whether aspirated or not, e.g. 3561; but ‘for mi"
34844,LIB. IV.,"housebondes were,’ vii. 4813, (with ‘myn housebonde’ below, 4829)."
34845,LIB. IV.,
34846,LIB. IV.,3187 ff. This seems to be for the most part original. A hint may have
34847,LIB. IV.,been given by the lines of Ovid in which it is suggested that Aurora
34848,LIB. IV.,might have used a somewhat similar prayer:
34849,LIB. IV.,
34850,LIB. IV.,"‘At si quem manibus Cephalum complexa teneres,"
34851,LIB. IV.,"Clamares, Lente currite, noctis equi.’"

34853,LIB. IV.,"_Amor._ i. 13, 39."
34854,LIB. IV.,
34855,LIB. IV.,3222. The sun enters Capricorn on Dec. 21.
34856,LIB. IV.,
34857,LIB. IV.,"3273. _that he arise_: so 3374, ‘Til it be dai that I arise,’ and v."
34858,LIB. IV.,"3422, ‘Til dai cam that sche moste arise.’"
34859,LIB. IV.,
34860,LIB. IV.,The verb seems here to be attracted into the subjunctive by the
34861,LIB. IV.,indefinite meaning of ‘Til.’ In the other passages the mood is
34862,LIB. IV.,uncertain.
34863,LIB. IV.,
34864,LIB. IV.,"3317 ff. Ovid, _Metam._ i. 588-723, much abbreviated. It was, however,"
34865,LIB. IV.,Jupiter who turned Io into a cow.
34866,LIB. IV.,

34871,LIB. IV.,"For ‘that I nere’ cp. note on 1422. For ‘of this lif’ cp. vii. 2883,"
34872,LIB. IV.,‘whan he were of dawe.’

34874,LIB. IV.,3438 f. ‘And yet he (Obstinacy) cannot support his own cause by any
34875,LIB. IV.,argument but by headstrong wilfulness.’
34876,LIB. IV.,
34877,LIB. IV.,For the expression ‘of hed’ we may compare the Latin expression quoted
34878,LIB. IV.,"by Du Cange ‘de testa esse,’ explained ‘esse obstinatum’ (Ital. ‘essere"
34879,LIB. IV.,"di testa’), and the French adjective ‘testu,’"
34880,LIB. IV.,
34881,LIB. IV.,"‘Car fol estoient et testu,’ &c."
34882,LIB. IV.,
34883,LIB. IV.,Froissart says of Pope Urban VI that after his election ‘il s’en
34884,LIB. IV.,"outrecuida et enorguilli, et volt user de poissance et de teste,’"
34885,LIB. IV.,"which is translated by Berners, ‘he waxed proude and worked all on"
34886,LIB. IV.,heed.’ We find also the Latin adjective ‘capitosus’ used by Gower
34887,LIB. IV.,"in the margin at the beginning of the _Cronica Tripertita_, and the"
34888,LIB. IV.,"adverb ‘capitose,’ meaning ‘in a headstrong manner,’ in Walsingham,"
34889,LIB. IV.,"_Hist. Anglica_, e.g. ‘Regem contra regni consuetudinem Cancellarium"
34890,LIB. IV.,"deposuisse capitose,’ vol. ii. p. 70 (Rolls Series)."
34891,LIB. IV.,
34892,LIB. IV.,The usual way of reading the sentence has been to punctuate after
34893,LIB. IV.,"‘skile’ and to take ‘bot of hed’ with the next line, ‘but he wastes"
34894,LIB. IV.,away in his condition’ (‘hed’ from a supposed ‘hǣd’ akin to the suffix
34895,LIB. IV.,"‘-hed’ or ‘-hede’). This word perhaps occurs _Conf. Am._ ii. 2066, but"
34896,LIB. IV.,"it would give no very good sense here, and it is doubtful whether it"
34897,LIB. IV.,would be rhymed with ‘ded.’ The suffix ‘-hed’ ‘-hede’ apparently has
34898,LIB. IV.,"‘ẹ’ in Gower’s rhymes. Again, if so marked a break in the middle of the"
34899,LIB. IV.,"line were intended, the Fairfax MS. would almost certainly have had a"
34900,LIB. IV.,"stop to indicate it, as in 3423, 3431, 3458, 3459, 3484, 3485, to quote"
34901,LIB. IV.,instances only from the same page of the MS.
34902,LIB. IV.,
34903,LIB. IV.,"For the use of ‘avowe’ in this sense, cp. v. 124."
34904,LIB. IV.,
34905,LIB. IV.,"3515 ff. The story is based upon Ovid, _Metam._ xiv. 698-761. Our"
34906,LIB. IV.,"author, however, has reversed the position of the lover and his"
34907,LIB. IV.,"mistress. In Ovid Anaxarete is a high-born maid of the race of Teucer,"
34908,LIB. IV.,"while Iphis is ‘humili de stirpe creatus.’ Moreover, the story is"
34909,LIB. IV.,"considerably developed by Gower, to whom belong the speech of Iphis,"
34910,LIB. IV.,"the whole account of the grief and self-condemnation of Araxarathen,"
34911,LIB. IV.,"the details of the funeral and the tomb, and finally the very"
34912,LIB. IV.,successful epitaph. Ovid says that she saw from a window the body of
34913,LIB. IV.,"Iphis being carried by for burial, and was forthwith turned into stone,"
34914,LIB. IV.,and that as witness of the truth of his tale a statue may still be seen
34915,LIB. IV.,"at Salamis. There is nothing said about remorse on her part, rather the"
34916,LIB. IV.,opposite is implied.
34917,LIB. IV.,
34918,LIB. IV.,3516. Our author supposes this to be the same as the person mentioned
34919,LIB. IV.,in iii. 2645 ff. (who is really Teuthras king of Mysia). This is Teucer
34920,LIB. IV.,"son of Telamon, founder of Salamis in Cyprus."
34921,LIB. IV.,
34922,LIB. IV.,3520 f. These lines are transposed for the sake of the rhyme. It means
34923,LIB. IV.,"‘on a maid of low estate compared with his’: cp. ii. 709, and below, l."

35452,E 1749:,"as given in Pauli’s edition, is quite sound, and Prof. Skeat’s"
35453,E 1749:,defence of it will not do. Gower never rhymes a past participle
35454,E 1749:,"in _-ed_ with a weak preterite, though he sometimes drops the"
35455,E 1749:,_-e_ of the preterite before a vowel. The rhyme was good enough

35471,E 1749:,[AD] It may be noted that the four second recension MSS.
35472,E 1749:,which contain the author’s Latin note about his books (‘Quia
35473,E 1749:,"vnusquisque,’ &c.), viz. BTΛP₂, agree in a form of it which"
35474,E 1749:,is different both from that which is given by first recension
35475,E 1749:,"copies and that which we find in F, and is clearly intermediate"
35476,E 1749:,"between the other two, the first form fully excusing Richard II"
35477,E 1749:,for the troubles of his reign and the third entirely condemning
35478,E 1749:,"him, while this makes no mention of his merits or demerits, but"
35479,E 1749:,simply prays for the state of the kingdom. It is noticeable
35480,E 1749:,that the second recension form definitely substitutes Henry
35481,E 1749:,"for Richard as the patron of the _Confessio Amantis_, though"
35482,E 1749:,in one at least of the copies to which it is attached this

35490,E 1749:,It should be noted that AJM and FWH₃ represent in each case a
35491,E 1749:,"group of about seven MSS., and H₁ ... B₂ one of nearly twenty."
35492,E 1749:,We observe in the examples given that B and A are sometimes
35493,E 1749:,found either separately or together on the side of the H₁ ...
35494,E 1749:,"B₂ group, and that the same is true occasionally of W, while"
35495,E 1749:,on the other hand some MSS. of the H₁ ... B₂ group are apt to
35496,E 1749:,pass over to the other side in a certain part of the text and
35497,E 1749:,support what we call the revised reading.

35506,E 1749:,"[AI] It is doubtful, however, whether the special connexion"

35508,E 1749:,to begin about iii. 1500. The question about the relative

35511,E 1749:,the part where the connexion of B with the first recension is
35512,E 1749:,most apparent. The fact is that until about the middle of the
35513,E 1749:,"third book B is found usually in accord with the ERCLB₂ group,"
35514,E 1749:,and though it sometimes in these first books presents the
35515,E 1749:,"characteristic second recension reading, as ii. 193, 365 ff.,"

35521,E 1749:,[AK] In the case of most of these passages the text proves
35522,E 1749:,them to be taken from Caxton’s edition. Thus in Prol. 497 both
35523,E 1749:,"editions omit ‘to,’ Prol. 583 both omit ‘propre,’ i. 2248 both"
35524,E 1749:,"have ‘Vnder graue’ for ‘Vnder the grene,’ in 2354 ‘other’ for"
