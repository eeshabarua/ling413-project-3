61,DEAR PUBLIC:,"These Poems were written with pleasure; if they be read with pleasure, I"
62,DEAR PUBLIC:,shall be requited amply. How often the Guardian Angel of the Father of
63,DEAR PUBLIC:,Virginia in surpassing loveliness rose before my imagining eyes! Like
64,DEAR PUBLIC:,"the spirit of a dream, she glided through the foliage, verdant and"
65,DEAR PUBLIC:,"shadowy. Enchanted myself, the desire to enchant others seized me. The"
66,DEAR PUBLIC:,"""Poet's Enchanted Life"" is a gallery of poetic pictures of nature. Most"
67,DEAR PUBLIC:,"of the minor and miscellaneous pieces, breathe the spirit of virtuous"
68,DEAR PUBLIC:,"affection. If critics censure me unjustly or intemperately, I will fight"
69,DEAR PUBLIC:,"them--but I hope to find them, as well as you, dear Public, very kind"
70,DEAR PUBLIC:,friends of a loving Author.

78,POCAHONTAS.,
79,POCAHONTAS.,
80,POCAHONTAS.,"Where yonder moss-grown ruin[A] lonely stands,"
81,POCAHONTAS.,"Which from the James, the Pilgrim may survey,"
82,POCAHONTAS.,"Stretch alway forth its old, forsaken hands"
83,POCAHONTAS.,"As if to beg some friend its fall to stay,"
84,POCAHONTAS.,And now the wild vine flaunts in greenness gay;
85,POCAHONTAS.,"Erst rose a Castle, known to deathless fame,"
86,POCAHONTAS.,"Though now the mournful rampart falls away,"
87,POCAHONTAS.,"Hither Virginia's hero-father came,"
88,POCAHONTAS.,"To found a glorious state, and give these regions name."
89,POCAHONTAS.,
90,POCAHONTAS.,"For, then, both far and near the forest wide,"
91,POCAHONTAS.,"Stretched from the main unto the setting sun,"
92,POCAHONTAS.,"And Bears and Panthers walked in fiercest pride,"
93,POCAHONTAS.,"And slept at ease when their red feast was done,"
94,POCAHONTAS.,"But here of white men there had ne'er walked one,"
95,POCAHONTAS.,"But a fierce race of wild and savage hue,"
96,POCAHONTAS.,"Their simple life from chase and angling won,"
97,POCAHONTAS.,"And oft, when wrath arose, each other slew,"
98,POCAHONTAS.,In bloody wars which dyed their soil with crimson dew.
99,POCAHONTAS.,
100,POCAHONTAS.,I ween it was a novel sight to see
101,POCAHONTAS.,"The white man landing in the vasty wild,"
102,POCAHONTAS.,"Which each familiar creature seemed to flee,"
103,POCAHONTAS.,"Where not a christian dwelling ever smiled,"
104,POCAHONTAS.,"Nor e'er a well-known sound the ear beguiled,"
105,POCAHONTAS.,"But all was wild and hideous--and the heart,"
106,POCAHONTAS.,"Mayhap, of stout man, trembled as a child,"
107,POCAHONTAS.,"--And oft the exile's tear would, gushing, start,"
108,POCAHONTAS.,That ever he was lured from Albion's coast to part.
109,POCAHONTAS.,
110,POCAHONTAS.,"But there was one, the chieftain, of that band,"
111,POCAHONTAS.,"Whose soul no dread, however great, could chill,"
112,POCAHONTAS.,"His was the towering mind, the mighty hand,"
113,POCAHONTAS.,"On which, his feeble followers resting, still"
114,POCAHONTAS.,Would fear no peril from approaching ill.
115,POCAHONTAS.,"With him the strangers built their rugged home,"
116,POCAHONTAS.,"And turned the soil, and eat, and drank their fill;"
117,POCAHONTAS.,"Glad that to this fair Eden they had come,"
118,POCAHONTAS.,And reconciled became to their adopted home.
119,POCAHONTAS.,
120,POCAHONTAS.,"Thus pass'd away in peaceful happiness,"
121,POCAHONTAS.,"A little space by yonder river's side,"
122,POCAHONTAS.,"But now arose the wail of keen distress,"
123,POCAHONTAS.,"Gaunt Famine, with his murderous eye, they spied,"
124,POCAHONTAS.,"Stalk round the walls of those who wept and sighed,"
125,POCAHONTAS.,"And when their venturous chieftain wandered forth,"
126,POCAHONTAS.,"Ill hap betrayed him to the savage pride,"
127,POCAHONTAS.,"The death-club rose, his head upon the earth,"
128,POCAHONTAS.,"To perish there and thus, that man of kingly worth."
129,POCAHONTAS.,
130,POCAHONTAS.,"Not yet! before that last sad deed be done,"
131,POCAHONTAS.,"An Indian maiden springs beneath the blow,"
132,POCAHONTAS.,"And says her virgin blood shall freely run,"
133,POCAHONTAS.,"For him, extended on the ground below,"
134,POCAHONTAS.,"See! how, her face upturned, her tears do flow,"
135,POCAHONTAS.,"See Love and anguish painted in her eyes,"
136,POCAHONTAS.,"That, like a Seraph's, in their pity, glow,"
137,POCAHONTAS.,"And surely Angels, looking from the skies"
138,POCAHONTAS.,Claimed this poor savage girl a sister in disguise.
139,POCAHONTAS.,
140,POCAHONTAS.,"Those eyes, those tears prevent the falling stroke,"
141,POCAHONTAS.,"For Powhatan could not withstand her tears,"
142,POCAHONTAS.,"His favorite child, who, charmed, beneath the oak,"
143,POCAHONTAS.,"His savage spirit from her dawning years,"
144,POCAHONTAS.,"The wondering white man now he kindly rears,"
145,POCAHONTAS.,And bids his menials haste the Indian's fare
146,POCAHONTAS.,"For him whom now his daughter's love endears,"
147,POCAHONTAS.,"And lo! within the Lion's horrid lair,"
148,POCAHONTAS.,"The Dove has brought her mate, and sees him unhurt there."
149,POCAHONTAS.,
150,POCAHONTAS.,"Oh Love! how powerful o'er all thou art,"
151,POCAHONTAS.,"In dusky breasts or breasts of whiter hue,"
152,POCAHONTAS.,To thy delicious touch the human heart
153,POCAHONTAS.,Throbs with respondent transport ever true.
154,POCAHONTAS.,"On Love's swift wings, this Indian virgin flew,"
155,POCAHONTAS.,"To snatch from hateful death the lovely chief,"
156,POCAHONTAS.,"Love drew her tears, like showers of pearly dew,"
157,POCAHONTAS.,Love filled her passionate breast with tender grief
158,POCAHONTAS.,"And love still drinks her soul, and naught can give relief."
159,POCAHONTAS.,
160,POCAHONTAS.,"She decks her long, black hair with gayest flowers"
161,POCAHONTAS.,"And tries each girlish art to warm his breast,"
162,POCAHONTAS.,"And, straying oft, among the leafy bowers,"
163,POCAHONTAS.,"Whilst Luna's silvery smiles upon them rest,"
164,POCAHONTAS.,"And Earth sleeps deeply, in that beauty drest,"
165,POCAHONTAS.,"The lonely Muckawiss[B], with doleful strain,"
166,POCAHONTAS.,"Pities her fate--alas, she is not blest,"
167,POCAHONTAS.,"But hopes and doubts, and dares to hope again,"
168,POCAHONTAS.,"That Smith may love, and ne'er is free from love's soft pain."
169,POCAHONTAS.,
170,POCAHONTAS.,"And fair was she, the dim wood's lustrous child,"
171,POCAHONTAS.,"Though born amid a race of uncouth men,"
172,POCAHONTAS.,"And gentle as the fawn, which, through the wild,"
173,POCAHONTAS.,"Trembled with timorous haste, and fled, and when"
174,POCAHONTAS.,"She stood within the rude and silent glen,"
175,POCAHONTAS.,"Of deepest forests, she appear'd more bright,"
176,POCAHONTAS.,"Than other nymphs who roamed these regions then,"
177,POCAHONTAS.,"And now--for o'er her form and sylph-like waist,"
178,POCAHONTAS.,A native modesty entranced the most fastidious taste.
179,POCAHONTAS.,
180,POCAHONTAS.,"He whom she loved to all these charms was cold,"
181,POCAHONTAS.,"Though well he saw her bosom's gentle fire,"
182,POCAHONTAS.,"Stern is the soul that worships fame or gold,"
183,POCAHONTAS.,To all that softer ecstacies inspire.
184,POCAHONTAS.,"A stony heart these tyrants e'er require,"
185,POCAHONTAS.,"Brave Smith ne'er thought of Pocahontas' love,"
186,POCAHONTAS.,But only that his name would glitter higher
187,POCAHONTAS.,"In coming centuries, others' names above,"
188,POCAHONTAS.,Whose soon contented souls an humbler distance rove.
189,POCAHONTAS.,
190,POCAHONTAS.,"To cheat her pining soul of this dear dream,"
191,POCAHONTAS.,"They told a dreary tale that he had died,"
192,POCAHONTAS.,"While to her father's hut, like some fair gleam"
193,POCAHONTAS.,"Of sunlight, with some heavenly thought, she hied,"
194,POCAHONTAS.,"And now both day and night, how sorely sighed,"
195,POCAHONTAS.,"And inly groaned the poor bereaved maid,"
196,POCAHONTAS.,"Nor could restrain strong nature's gushing tide,"
197,POCAHONTAS.,"That in the dark, cold grave, her love was laid;--"
198,POCAHONTAS.,"Disconsolate, she moved along the leafy glade."
199,POCAHONTAS.,
200,POCAHONTAS.,"Pausing beside her Smith's imagined tomb,"
201,POCAHONTAS.,"Weeping, by moonlight pale, she strewed fair flowers,"
202,POCAHONTAS.,"To wither o'er him, emblems of his bloom"
203,POCAHONTAS.,So soon departed from these lovely bowers.
204,POCAHONTAS.,"Once plucked, these buds will never bless the showers,"
205,POCAHONTAS.,"Sweet charities, by wearing wonted charms,"
206,POCAHONTAS.,But lose for aye their balm for summer hours;
207,POCAHONTAS.,"So all her showery grief him no more charms,"
208,POCAHONTAS.,To spring and rest a joy in her exulting arms.
209,POCAHONTAS.,
210,POCAHONTAS.,"She deems he sleeps within the envious ground,"
211,POCAHONTAS.,"Which stole him early from her young, warm breast,"
212,POCAHONTAS.,"No more her brow with wild flower wreaths is bound,"
213,POCAHONTAS.,"And all her ornaments, neglected, rest;"
214,POCAHONTAS.,Since fled is now the dreamy hope which blest
215,POCAHONTAS.,"Her artless soul, she loathes her glance to fling"
216,POCAHONTAS.,"On corals, braids, and flowers, and royal vest,"
217,POCAHONTAS.,"And slowly wanders like some moon-struck thing,"
218,POCAHONTAS.,"Through gloomy cypress groves, and by yon haunted spring."
219,POCAHONTAS.,
220,POCAHONTAS.,But time must soothe the most exquisite smart
221,POCAHONTAS.,"Of love, when wounded by the dart of death;"
222,POCAHONTAS.,"For life would flee, should not such woe depart,"
223,POCAHONTAS.,Too deeply weighing on the heart beneath.
224,POCAHONTAS.,Fair Pocahontas breathes the wonted breath
225,POCAHONTAS.,"Of tranquil life, a creature darkly bright,"
226,POCAHONTAS.,"Decking her hair again with many a wreath,"
227,POCAHONTAS.,"Walking amid the high wood's gentle night,"
228,POCAHONTAS.,"Charming her wild, old Father's heart with strange delight."
229,POCAHONTAS.,
230,POCAHONTAS.,"Yet nought could make her cease to view with love,"
231,POCAHONTAS.,The tender memory of the mournful past;
232,POCAHONTAS.,"And once when warring clouds grew black above,"
233,POCAHONTAS.,"The shrieking Earth with awful night o'ercast,"
234,POCAHONTAS.,And long foiled Hatred hoped to glut his fast
235,POCAHONTAS.,"With English gore, with irksome steps she stole,"
236,POCAHONTAS.,"O'er deep morass, through tangled brake, and cast"
237,POCAHONTAS.,"The boon of life to each devoted soul,"
238,POCAHONTAS.,Who slept within that Castle's frail and weak control.
239,POCAHONTAS.,
240,POCAHONTAS.,"Oh! we might marvel that her savage heart,"
241,POCAHONTAS.,Would show such love to her loved father's foes;
242,POCAHONTAS.,"But love like this, will act no selfish part;"
243,POCAHONTAS.,"Over drear earth, diffusing joy, it goes,"
244,POCAHONTAS.,"Its breath the fragrance of the earliest rose,"
245,POCAHONTAS.,"Its voice the sound of an unearthly thing,"
246,POCAHONTAS.,"Its form an Angel's, and as pure as those,"
247,POCAHONTAS.,"Who come to gladdened man on shining wing,"
248,POCAHONTAS.,Which scatters round the sweets of an immortal spring.
249,POCAHONTAS.,
250,POCAHONTAS.,"Now when the dogwood gemmed with blossoms white,"
251,POCAHONTAS.,"The gorgeous grove where oak and stately pine,"
252,POCAHONTAS.,"Upthrew their gnarled arms of massy might,"
253,POCAHONTAS.,"And thus a leafy canopy did twine,"
254,POCAHONTAS.,"This dusky Dryad would with grace recline,"
255,POCAHONTAS.,"Along the mossy bank of crystal stream,"
256,POCAHONTAS.,"In whose smooth glass her angel beauties shine,"
257,POCAHONTAS.,"Beside brave Rolfe, a man of pallid gleam,"
258,POCAHONTAS.,"Who sighed his soul to her, and taught her love's true dream."
259,POCAHONTAS.,
260,POCAHONTAS.,"Beneath the silver moon, resplendent queen,"
261,POCAHONTAS.,"With simple rites, these mingling souls were wed;"
262,POCAHONTAS.,"The happy stars looked down, with brighter sheen,"
263,POCAHONTAS.,To view love's wretched fears for ever fled;
264,POCAHONTAS.,"The wild flowers trembled in their dewy bed,"
265,POCAHONTAS.,And up a most enchanting fragrance sent;
266,POCAHONTAS.,"The blissful Hours, unnoticed, onward sped;"
267,POCAHONTAS.,"And, with their gentle music sweetly blent,"
268,POCAHONTAS.,The breathing winds and waters murmured their content.
269,POCAHONTAS.,
270,POCAHONTAS.,"Ah me! what deep, celestial transports thrill'd"
271,POCAHONTAS.,"These beating bosoms, in so sweet a scene:"
272,POCAHONTAS.,"What tears of tender joy their visions filled,"
273,POCAHONTAS.,Scanning each other's soul-absorbing mien
274,POCAHONTAS.,"And, in that bower of paradisal green,"
275,POCAHONTAS.,"Happy, they sighed, in accents fond and warm,"
276,POCAHONTAS.,"That thus enclosed Earth's primal pair had been,"
277,POCAHONTAS.,"Where oft they spied bright Seraph's glorious form,"
278,POCAHONTAS.,And rose on high afar the grove's eternal charm.
279,POCAHONTAS.,
280,POCAHONTAS.,"There oft the mocking bird, a songster gay,"
281,POCAHONTAS.,"Would soothe their souls, with multifarious song,"
282,POCAHONTAS.,"Singing his farewell-hymns to dying Day,"
283,POCAHONTAS.,As fade his smiles the darkening glades along;
284,POCAHONTAS.,"And when the frowns of night more thickly throng,"
285,POCAHONTAS.,"The amorous firefly led them at that hour,"
286,POCAHONTAS.,"O'er wooded hills, and marshes deep and long,"
287,POCAHONTAS.,"To their sweet rest, which sank, with grateful power,"
288,POCAHONTAS.,"Along their wearied nerves, in their wild, oaken bower."
289,POCAHONTAS.,
290,POCAHONTAS.,"As flows the stream, with calm, unruffled wave,"
291,POCAHONTAS.,"O'er shining sands, to kiss the glassy main,"
292,POCAHONTAS.,"So flowed the life their gracious Maker gave,"
293,POCAHONTAS.,Nor felt the obstructive power of obvious pain;
294,POCAHONTAS.,"So deep o'er them was Passion's rapturous reign,"
295,POCAHONTAS.,"That mid their bower's delicious solitude,"
296,POCAHONTAS.,They dreamed their hearts might never sigh again;
297,POCAHONTAS.,"By love their gentle spirits were subdued,"
298,POCAHONTAS.,To the deep rapture of a heavenly seeming mood.
299,POCAHONTAS.,
300,POCAHONTAS.,"Alas! the race of Pocahontas flow,"
301,POCAHONTAS.,"As waves, away, which can return no more;"
302,POCAHONTAS.,"No more o'er plain and peak they bear the bow,"
303,POCAHONTAS.,Or shove the skiff from yonder curving shore;
304,POCAHONTAS.,"Their reign, their histories, their names are o'er;"
305,POCAHONTAS.,The plow insults their sires' indignant bones;
306,POCAHONTAS.,The very land disowns its look of yore;
307,POCAHONTAS.,"Vast cities rise, and hark! I hear the tones"
308,POCAHONTAS.,Of many mingling Tongues; and boundless labour groans.
309,POCAHONTAS.,
310,POCAHONTAS.,"And paler nymphs are sweetly wooed and won,"
311,POCAHONTAS.,"Upon this soil, and they are happy too,"
312,POCAHONTAS.,"But of these fairer English damsels, none"
313,POCAHONTAS.,"Have shown devotion more divinely true,"
314,POCAHONTAS.,"Than thou, untutor'd maid of dusky hue;"
315,POCAHONTAS.,"Nor shall thy tribes from memory vanish quite,"
316,POCAHONTAS.,"While beauteous deeds as angels ofttimes do,"
317,POCAHONTAS.,"Still sway the generous mind with heavenly might,"
318,POCAHONTAS.,For thine would snatch even worse from Time's oblivious night.
319,POCAHONTAS.,
320,POCAHONTAS.,"The tallest fir, that decks the blooming grove,"
321,POCAHONTAS.,"Decays the first, the most abounding rose,"
322,POCAHONTAS.,By worms is first consumed; the pearl we love
323,POCAHONTAS.,"Is stolen first, the star that brightest glows"
324,POCAHONTAS.,"To gild the gloom, is first that sets, and those"
325,POCAHONTAS.,"Whose lovely lives on earth we prized the most,"
326,POCAHONTAS.,"And most assuaged the pangs of thronging woes,"
327,POCAHONTAS.,"Which--oh how oft! our fated paths have cross'd,"
328,POCAHONTAS.,"By all are ever mourned, ""the loved and early lost."""
329,POCAHONTAS.,
330,POCAHONTAS.,"So Rolfe's dear spouse was early snatched away,--"
331,POCAHONTAS.,But left one pledge of her undying love--
332,POCAHONTAS.,(Perchance her happy spirit oft would stray
333,POCAHONTAS.,Round their dear footsteps wheresoe'er they rove)
334,POCAHONTAS.,And Europe's turf grow green her heart above.
335,POCAHONTAS.,No more could grief or joy disturb her breast.
336,POCAHONTAS.,Soft by her tomb let musing Fancy move!
337,POCAHONTAS.,Let not a sound of thoughtlessness molest
338,POCAHONTAS.,The melancholy spot of her eternal rest!
339,POCAHONTAS.,
340,POCAHONTAS.,Her fair form sank low in the gloomy earth--
341,POCAHONTAS.,"Her spirit soared and found a brighter home,"
342,POCAHONTAS.,"Where now with sun-bright smiles, she wanders forth,"
343,POCAHONTAS.,Beneath the glories of a heavenly dome;
344,POCAHONTAS.,"Where Seraphs o'er bright fields forever roam,"
345,POCAHONTAS.,"And flowers aloft Life's never dying tree,"
346,POCAHONTAS.,Whither no evil thing can ever come;
347,POCAHONTAS.,Where now she blends her heart and harp to sing
348,POCAHONTAS.,A ceaseless song of praise to her Eternal King.
349,POCAHONTAS.,
350,POCAHONTAS.,"But oft the eye which scans yon ruin old,"
351,POCAHONTAS.,"Where Jamestown erst in simple grandeur rose,"
352,POCAHONTAS.,Shall fill with tears--as there it doth behold--
353,POCAHONTAS.,"For it will speak to him of heroes' woes,"
354,POCAHONTAS.,"Felt erewhile whence this river gently flows,--"
355,POCAHONTAS.,"And sprang this famous, Hero-bearing State;--"
356,POCAHONTAS.,"And while with pride his patriot bosom glows,"
357,POCAHONTAS.,"His heart her gentle history will relate,"
358,POCAHONTAS.,"And warmly laud her deeds, and mourn her early fate."

402,PART FIRST.,"Sweet Elfindale, e'er loved of yore,"
403,PART FIRST.,"Has grown more fair, beloved more,"
404,PART FIRST.,"A part of some fay-walked shore,"
405,PART FIRST.,A haunt of beauties rare.
406,PART FIRST.,"The gay dawn smells more fragrant there,"
407,PART FIRST.,"(When youthful May, new, fresh and fair,"
408,PART FIRST.,"Comes, bird-like through the laughing air,)"
409,PART FIRST.,Than it was even of old;
410,PART FIRST.,"And Evening throws a richer dress,"
411,PART FIRST.,"(O'er Elfindale's mild loveliness,)"
412,PART FIRST.,Of fading pink and gold.
413,PART FIRST.,"The moonlight nights are lovelier now,"
414,PART FIRST.,On silent Elfindale;
415,PART FIRST.,"More pure the beams, more soft the glow,"
416,PART FIRST.,That sleeps upon the vale:
417,PART FIRST.,So much of beauty God hath given
418,PART FIRST.,To sweetest Frankie--gracious Heaven!
419,PART FIRST.,"She spares so much to beautify,"
420,PART FIRST.,"Fair Elfindale to my charm'd eye,--"
421,PART FIRST.,And yet she loses none at all
422,PART FIRST.,Of that which holds my soul in thrall.
423,PART FIRST.,"Now, if my harp shall echo well,"
424,PART FIRST.,"The story of her life, and tell,"
425,PART FIRST.,"In worthy feet, her beauty's power"
426,PART FIRST.,"That flourished as a springtime flower,"
427,PART FIRST.,"I shall be richer, happier far"
428,PART FIRST.,"Than one should own a round, bright star."
429,PART FIRST.,"And what if the fair maid should smile,"
430,PART FIRST.,To hear my warbled strain?
431,PART FIRST.,"Ah! that would all my grief beguile,"
432,PART FIRST.,Undo the life of Pain.
433,PART FIRST.,I one time saw a laughing mirth
434,PART FIRST.,"Leap in the maiden's eyes,"
435,PART FIRST.,And thought the too aspiring earth
436,PART FIRST.,"Had robbed the jewelled skies,"
437,PART FIRST.,"Of one bright angel, even her:"
438,PART FIRST.,She made my very being stir.
439,PART FIRST.,
440,PART FIRST.,"I ne'er saw sweet Frankie's mother,"
441,PART FIRST.,"What I had glowed to see,"
442,PART FIRST.,"Yet think no mortal earth's another,"
443,PART FIRST.,Bore child so fair as she.
444,PART FIRST.,I ween that mother was a queen
445,PART FIRST.,"In royal qualities,"
446,PART FIRST.,"And in her lofty eyes and mien,"
447,PART FIRST.,Lurked lovely majesties.
448,PART FIRST.,"I ne'er saw sweet Frankie's mother,"
449,PART FIRST.,What I had glowed to see;
450,PART FIRST.,"But cannot, long-lost mother! smother"
451,PART FIRST.,The love that swells for thee.
452,PART FIRST.,
453,PART FIRST.,"When Frankie came into this world,"
454,PART FIRST.,"In lovely Elfindale,"
455,PART FIRST.,"The winds were lulled, and waves lay curled,"
456,PART FIRST.,Beneath the moonlight pale:
457,PART FIRST.,"The cold stars twinkled far above,"
458,PART FIRST.,"And danced, with their bright eyes of love;"
459,PART FIRST.,"The gleaming waters did rejoice,"
460,PART FIRST.,"And breathed a soft, enamored voice;"
461,PART FIRST.,"The sleeping zephyr on his flowers,"
462,PART FIRST.,Awaked to bless the gliding hours
463,PART FIRST.,"Which gave this tiny being, birth,"
464,PART FIRST.,"A bliss, a Blessing to the earth."
465,PART FIRST.,"She was, in truth, a beauteous child:"
466,PART FIRST.,At three years old her eyes were wild
467,PART FIRST.,With something of a playfulness;
468,PART FIRST.,And then she had the softest tress
469,PART FIRST.,"Of auburn tint, that fell and flew"
470,PART FIRST.,About her neck of damask hue.
471,PART FIRST.,"To watch throughout the Summer day,"
472,PART FIRST.,"The butterfly's capricious play,"
473,PART FIRST.,"Or humming bird's bright, rainbow wings,"
474,PART FIRST.,"And all gay, joyous, natural things."
475,PART FIRST.,"To hear the poets of the grove,"
476,PART FIRST.,Sing forth their little lays of love;
477,PART FIRST.,"Or to survey the stars come forth,"
478,PART FIRST.,Or dancing rainbows hug the earth:
479,PART FIRST.,"These were the pastime and the play,"
480,PART FIRST.,That whiled her infant hours away.
481,PART FIRST.,"And blest was sylvan Elfindale,"
482,PART FIRST.,With child so fair within its pale.
483,PART FIRST.,
484,PART FIRST.,"That was a bland and holy morn,"
485,PART FIRST.,"Like one, on very purpose, born,"
486,PART FIRST.,"A gray godmother stood,"
487,PART FIRST.,"Before the chancel's sacred place,"
488,PART FIRST.,"With Frankie's sweet and artless grace,"
489,PART FIRST.,And heard the preacher good.
490,PART FIRST.,"And as the bright baptism fell,"
491,PART FIRST.,"Upon her fallen tresses well,"
492,PART FIRST.,"And o'er her bosom's chastened swell,"
493,PART FIRST.,The beauteous maiden smiled:
494,PART FIRST.,She looked a wingless cherub then--
495,PART FIRST.,"My inmost spirit fluttered, when"
496,PART FIRST.,"I said, O wondrous child!"
497,PART FIRST.,I thought a troop of angels stood
498,PART FIRST.,"Amid that lofty fane,"
499,PART FIRST.,And (I in that ecstatic mood)
500,PART FIRST.,They sped to bliss again.
501,PART FIRST.,"That, whole bright day, I wandered wide,"
502,PART FIRST.,"O'er sunny hill and vale,"
503,PART FIRST.,And thought no day of brighter pride
504,PART FIRST.,E'er lay on Elfindale;
505,PART FIRST.,"I thought, that day dear Frankie love,"
506,PART FIRST.,Had been new-linked with those above;
507,PART FIRST.,And henceforth angels would attend
508,PART FIRST.,"The maiden, to her journey's end."
509,PART FIRST.,
510,PART FIRST.,Fair Frankie grew in attributes
511,PART FIRST.,"That harmonized like golden flutes,"
512,PART FIRST.,Or harps of silver strain:
513,PART FIRST.,"She loved the Lovely--growing so,"
514,PART FIRST.,With every year's advancing flow;--
515,PART FIRST.,She was the Death of Pain!
516,PART FIRST.,"The dwellers in green Elfindale,"
517,PART FIRST.,"Were happier all for her,"
518,PART FIRST.,"The very flowers she loved to trail,"
519,PART FIRST.,"With pleasure's thrill, would stir."
520,PART FIRST.,She loved both man and brute that dwelt
521,PART FIRST.,Within that vale of Good;
522,PART FIRST.,"And they, as bettered beings, felt"
523,PART FIRST.,New virtue--as they should.
524,PART FIRST.,"And thus a shining, golden chain,"
525,PART FIRST.,"Of many links of love,"
526,PART FIRST.,"Knit Frankie to the peopled plain,"
527,PART FIRST.,And to the good above.
528,PART FIRST.,"Affection's wreathed rings of beauty,"
529,PART FIRST.,Bound round a globe of gold;
530,PART FIRST.,"It is my verse's pleasing duty,"
531,PART FIRST.,"To say to all, behold,"
532,PART FIRST.,Sweet Frank that central globe of worth;
533,PART FIRST.,"That gems, with pride, this spot of earth,"
534,PART FIRST.,"This flower-engirdled, blissful vale,"
535,PART FIRST.,This heart-delighting Elfindale.
536,PART FIRST.,
537,PART FIRST.,"And now when lovely Frankie stood,"
538,PART FIRST.,"In the dear pride of womanhood,"
539,PART FIRST.,The queen of Elfindale;
540,PART FIRST.,One sought her for her loveliness--
541,PART FIRST.,A joy--a heaven of happiness--
542,PART FIRST.,An earth-born angel meant to bless
543,PART FIRST.,My throbbing soul with rich excess
544,PART FIRST.,Of joys that never fail.
545,PART FIRST.,"She sat hid in a garden bower,"
546,PART FIRST.,"Watching the first, sweet star,"
547,PART FIRST.,"That crowns the lovely twilight hour,"
548,PART FIRST.,And glows to earth from far.
549,PART FIRST.,"A sad sweet dream oppressed her thought,"
550,PART FIRST.,"And tinged her calm, white face;"
551,PART FIRST.,"Her eyes fixed fast, their radiance fraught,"
552,PART FIRST.,With melancholy grace.
553,PART FIRST.,"I stole unto her close retreat,"
554,PART FIRST.,As winds creep on a vale;
555,PART FIRST.,"And, standing, gazed upon the sweet,"
556,PART FIRST.,Sweet queen of Elfindale.
557,PART FIRST.,"She turned her head, she faintly smiled,"
558,PART FIRST.,She bent her gaze on me;
559,PART FIRST.,"It made my very spirit wild,"
560,PART FIRST.,With thrilling ecstacy.
561,PART FIRST.,"I caught and clasped, her to my heart,"
562,PART FIRST.,Yet never spoke a word;--
563,PART FIRST.,"But the twin-vow that could not part,"
564,PART FIRST.,By Love in Heaven was heard.
565,PART FIRST.,
566,PART FIRST.,
567,PART SECOND.,PART SECOND.
568,PART SECOND.,
569,PART SECOND.,"Again unto the lofty fane,"
570,PART SECOND.,Sweet Frankie lightly went;
571,PART SECOND.,With smiling joy and same of pair
572,PART SECOND.,Upon her features blent.
573,PART SECOND.,"Again, as on that sunny morn,"
574,PART SECOND.,"When white-winged angels stood,"
575,PART SECOND.,"To see her, of bright water, born,"
576,PART SECOND.,Before the preacher good.
577,PART SECOND.,"Again within the chancel's gloom,"
578,PART SECOND.,"She sweetly, gently stands;"
579,PART SECOND.,"With marriage hymn, with rich perfume,"
580,PART SECOND.,With Hymen's happy bands;
581,PART SECOND.,"With wild-rose wreaths, with gayest bloom,"
582,PART SECOND.,And wreathed maiden's hands.
583,PART SECOND.,"But, now she stands with me even there,"
584,PART SECOND.,"With sweetly downcast eyes,"
585,PART SECOND.,"So purely white, so passing fair,"
586,PART SECOND.,Like one of Paradise.
587,PART SECOND.,"The preacher speaks the solemn words,"
588,PART SECOND.,Yet fraught with deepest bliss;
589,PART SECOND.,"We twain in one are bound by chords,"
590,PART SECOND.,With sob--with clasp--with kiss.
591,PART SECOND.,"Returning from that sacred place,"
592,PART SECOND.,"All earth and sky rejoiced,"
593,PART SECOND.,And all the winds and waters' race
594,PART SECOND.,Their compliments then voiced.
595,PART SECOND.,"The birds sang sweetly on the spray,"
596,PART SECOND.,As they ne'er sang before;
597,PART SECOND.,"And love lay o'er the world away,"
598,PART SECOND.,A robe of golden ore.
599,PART SECOND.,
600,PART SECOND.,"And now, we live in Elfindale,"
601,PART SECOND.,Dear Frank and I together;
602,PART SECOND.,"And there is light on this sweet dale,"
603,PART SECOND.,"In calm, or stormy weather."
604,PART SECOND.,A fairy daughter leaps between
605,PART SECOND.,Our nightly moving paces;
606,PART SECOND.,"Upon whose soft and marble brow,"
607,PART SECOND.,Gleam many artless graces.
608,PART SECOND.,"We dwell, we dwell, in Elfindale--"
609,PART SECOND.,I--child--and happy mother;
610,PART SECOND.,"And, if earth holds a sweeter vale,"
611,PART SECOND.,We cannot wish another.
612,PART SECOND.,"Life has been arched with bluer skies,"
613,PART SECOND.,By curved rainbows brighter;
614,PART SECOND.,"And nature--ah! what wondrous dyes,"
615,PART SECOND.,Now lavishly bedight her.
616,PART SECOND.,"Love has become a glorious robe,"
617,PART SECOND.,With thickest gold o'erladen;
618,PART SECOND.,And now we dwell upon a globe
619,PART SECOND.,"Which is, indeed, an Aidenn."
620,PART SECOND.,I dwell with fixed eyes upon
621,PART SECOND.,"My wife and cherub maiden,"
622,PART SECOND.,"I feel the light of that fire-sun,"
623,PART SECOND.,"That broadly shines on Aidenn,--"
624,PART SECOND.,"And all our days that brightly run,"
625,PART SECOND.,Are heavily joy-laden--
626,PART SECOND.,"And now we know our grief is done,"
627,PART SECOND.,And that we dwell in Aidenn.

4659,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"And felt sweet Peace her softest balm infuse,"
4660,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,Into his once too world-disturbed breast:
4661,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,There did he find a deep and quiet rest:
4662,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"The mockbird sang his vespers, while the star"

4664,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"There no rude sound the halcyon calm did mar,"

4672,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"And, often mid this sylvan scene was heard,"
4673,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"(Where no vile Envy gave its serpent hiss,)"
4674,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"The voice of love, the only, joyous, word"

4677,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"Sweet pair! with all that's best of life, possest,"

4681,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"And, when at evening mild, they saunter'd forth,"
4682,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"Beneath the rosy sky, they looked toward heaven,"
4683,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"And wondered why this was so bright an earth,"
4684,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"And why that God whose gifts to man are even,"
4685,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,This wondrous happiness to them alone had given.
4686,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,
4687,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"Then came a dark-soul'd man, with magic eye,"

4689,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"Became his slave, he could not now deny"
4690,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"His devilish spell, a villian, smooth refin'd,"
4691,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"Whose mighty arts his thoughtless victim bind,"
4692,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"In fearful chains: Burr was this Satan's name,"
4693,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"Who crept into this Eden unconfin'd,"
4694,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"And drove this erring pair of later fame,"
4695,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"Like that of old, to roam and sigh o'er earth the same."
4696,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,
4697,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"""Come, go with me,"" said Burr, ""and you shall find,"
4698,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"Strange honors, riches, and a deathless name,"""
4699,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"And Blannerhasset thought the villian kind,"
4700,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"Who fed his soul, on novel dreams of fame,"
4701,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"While Burr aspir'd to breathe a sinful flame,"
4702,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"Through Blannerhasset's sweet and guiltless wife,"
4703,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"But she his artful cozening overcame,"

4705,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,And sacredly maintained the whiteness of her life.
4706,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,
4707,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"But they were ruin'd, this sequester'd pair,"
4708,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"Who shunn'd the world's alluring charms to crime,"
4709,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"Soon they were driven forth in dark despair,"

4722,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,While he recalls that mournful history;
4723,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"And he may ask, with sudden sorrow, why,"
4724,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,The dream of rapture doth so early flee
4725,BLANNERHASSETT'S ISLAND.,"And souls so meek and good, the prey of fiends should be."
