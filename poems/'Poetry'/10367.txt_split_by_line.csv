57,PREFACE.,
58,PREFACE.,
59,PREFACE.,This Volume is submitted to the Public with all that diffidence which
60,PREFACE.,"ought to attend the publication of Verses, many of which were written"
61,PREFACE.,"in the gay and happy era of boyhood, and others in subsequent periods"
62,PREFACE.,"of maturer life, as a relief from more arduous pursuits."
63,PREFACE.,
64,PREFACE.,They lay no pretensions to the depth and solidity of the effusions of
65,PREFACE.,the Muse in her elevated flights; they are the few wild notes of the
66,PREFACE.,"simple shepherd, and do not even affect to imitate the rich cadence of"
67,PREFACE.,the scientific musician.
68,PREFACE.,
69,PREFACE.,"If the Author might, without the imputation of vanity, select for them"
70,PREFACE.,"a place in the Temple of Poetry, he would endeavour to class them in"
71,PREFACE.,that niche which is appropriated for the reception of the light and
72,PREFACE.,playful _Vers de Societé_.
73,PREFACE.,
74,PREFACE.,"Should the Reader find them but little worthy of his approval, he will"
75,PREFACE.,not have reason at the same time to condemn their prolixity: their
76,PREFACE.,"brevity will, at least in some degree, atone for their want of fire and"
77,PREFACE.,fancy.
78,PREFACE.,
79,PREFACE.,It is thought proper to state that some of the following Poems have
80,PREFACE.,"appeared before at various times, in a fugitive shape; and that the"
81,PREFACE.,Poetry in the Author’s Tours is here collected.

103,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"While not a sound disturbs thy stony hall,"
104,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"While all thy dewy drops forget to fall,—"
105,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Why canst thou not thy soothing charms impart,"
106,IN DEVONSHIRE.,And shed thy quiet o’er this beating heart?
107,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Tell me, thou richly-painted river! tell,"
108,IN DEVONSHIRE.,That on thy mirror’d plane dost mimic well
109,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Each pendent tree and every distant hill,"
110,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Tipp’d with red lustre, beauteous, bright, and still,—"
111,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Can I not, gazing on thy tranquil tide,"
112,IN DEVONSHIRE.,Shed ev’ry grief upon thy rocky side?
113,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Or must I rove thy margin, calm and clear,"
114,IN DEVONSHIRE.,The only agitated object near?
115,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Oh! tell me, too, thou babbling cold cascade!"
116,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Whose waters, falling thro’ successive shade,"
117,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Unspangled by the brightness of the sky,"
118,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Awake each echo to a soft reply,—"
119,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Say, canst thou not my bosom-grief befriend,"
120,IN DEVONSHIRE.,And bid one drop upon my heart descend?
121,IN DEVONSHIRE.,When all thy songsters soothe themselves to sleep.
122,IN DEVONSHIRE.,Ah! must these aching eyes for ever weep?
123,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"And must their frequent waters, like thine own,"
124,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Drop, idly drop, on unimpressive stone?"
125,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Or, when my beauteous fair shall deign to grace"
126,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"The humid foliage of thy mossy base,"
127,IN DEVONSHIRE.,Canst thou not tell how many a rock below
128,IN DEVONSHIRE.,Impedes to kiss thy waters as they flow?
129,IN DEVONSHIRE.,In _her_ mind canst thou not the feeling rear
130,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"To stop, or thus caress, each genuine tear?"
131,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Teach her, oh! teach her, then, thou cold cascade!"
132,IN DEVONSHIRE.,Pour all thy lessons for the lovely maid!
133,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"And thou, bless’d grotto! let thy silence prove"
134,IN DEVONSHIRE.,Her mute consenting answer to my love!
135,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"And thou, bright river! as thou roll’st along,"
136,IN DEVONSHIRE.,Bear on thy wand’ring wave a lover’s song!
137,IN DEVONSHIRE.,"Strong as thy current, as thy waters pure,"
138,IN DEVONSHIRE.,Teach her to feel the passion I endure!

165,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","The last long separating stroke of Fate,—"
166,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",When round thy bed a kindred weeping train
167,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Call’d on thy voice to greet them, but in vain,—"
168,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",When o’er thy lips we watch’d thy fault’ring breath—

172,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Unsettled still, tho’ exercis’d to grieve,"

176,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","’Till with sad proof thy wasted relics rise,"

182,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","No common joy, no fugitive delight,"
183,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",Regret like this could in my breast excite;
184,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","For then my sorrow had been less severe,"
185,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",And tears less copious had bedew’d the bier.
186,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","From the same breast our milky food we drew,"
187,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",Entwin’d affection strengthen’d as we grew;
188,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",Why further trace? The flatt’ring dream is o’er—
189,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",Thy transient joys and sorrows are no more!

210,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Cold is that band which Music form’d her own,"
211,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",When ev’ry chord resign’d its sweetest tone.
212,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Ah! long, fair source of rapture, shall thou rest,"

216,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Tho’ with’ring Sickness mark’d thee in the womb,"
217,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","And form’d thy cradle but to form thy tomb,"
218,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Yet, like a flow’r, she bade thee reach thy prime,"

228,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Still, darting forward from the weight of woe,"
229,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",Thy soul with all its energy would glow;
230,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",Still with the purest passion wouldst thou prove
231,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",The glow of friendship and the warmth of love.
232,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","And ah! to sacred Memory ever nigh,"
233,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",Thy wit and humour claim the passing sigh:
234,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","When, thro’ the hour, with unresisted skill,"
235,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","I’ve seen thee mould each feature to thy will,—"
236,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","When friends drew round thee with attentive ear,"
237,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",Pleas’d with the raill’ry which they could not fear.
238,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Oh! how I’ve heard thee, with concealing art,"
239,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Join in the song, tho’ sorrow rent thy heart;"
240,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","How have I seen thee too, with venial guile,"
241,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","O’er many an anguish force the faithless smile,—"
242,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Seen suffering Nature check each sigh, each fear,"
243,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",To rob maternal fondness of a tear!
244,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",Alas! those scenes are past!—Vain was the pray’r
245,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",That ask’d of Fate to soften and to spare;
246,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Ah! vain, if wit and virtue could not save"
247,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",Thy youthful honours from an early grave.
248,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","But yet, if here my warm fraternal love"
249,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",May claim alliance with the realms above;
250,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","If kindred Nature, with perpetual bloom,"
251,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Transplanted springs, and lives beyond the tomb;"
252,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Thy pitying soul shall smile upon my grief,"
253,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",Shall feel a pang that wishes not relief;
254,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","In visions still shall shield me as I go,"
255,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.",Along this gloomy wilderness of woe;
256,"W.T.P. CARR, ESQ.","Shall still regard me with peculiar pride,"

2963,FIRST CONSUL.,No secret I hide from your generous breast;
2964,FIRST CONSUL.,This invasion is always _invading my rest_:
2965,FIRST CONSUL.,"My soldiers, poor devils! are ready to start,"
2966,FIRST CONSUL.,But to stay where I am is the wish of my heart;
2967,FIRST CONSUL.,And yet I have sworn at their head to appear:

2973,TALLEYRAND.,Why I think I’ve a snug little project in view:
2974,TALLEYRAND.,"I have felt for you long, and have ransack’d my brain"
2975,TALLEYRAND.,To relieve you from so much embarrassing pain.
2976,TALLEYRAND.,To-morrow our principal tools shall repair

2980,TALLEYRAND.,"An expedient which you, my good Consul, must try,"
2981,TALLEYRAND.,For a drop never yet wag observ’d in your eye!
2982,TALLEYRAND.,And therefore I think ’twould be better for you

3023,TALLEYRAND.,"Not that I, my dear Premier! conceive ’twould be right"
