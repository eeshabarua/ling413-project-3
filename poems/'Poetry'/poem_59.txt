C. W. S.

_The Fourth Bishop of Truro
May_ 1912

          Prince of courtesy defeated,
          Heir of hope untimely cheated,
          Throned awhile he sat, and, seated,

          Saw his Cornish round him gather;
          "Teach us how to live, good Father!"
          How to die he taught us rather:

Heard the startling trumpet sound him,
          Smiled upon the feast around him,
          Rose, and wrapp'd his coat, and bound him

          When beyond the awful surges,
          Bathed in dawn on Syrian verges,
          God! thy star, thy Cross emerges.

_And so sing we all to it--_

          Crux, in coelo lux superna,
          Sis in carnis hac taberna
          Mihi pedibus lucerna:

          Quo vexillum dux cohortis
          Sistet, super flumen Mortis,
          Te, flammantibus in portis!
