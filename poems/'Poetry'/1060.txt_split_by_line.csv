49,E. M. S.,"Though Care, oft coming, hath the guile"
50,E. M. S.,From younger lips to steal the smile;

72,E. M. S.,MANY of the verses and translations in this volume were published first
73,E. M. S.,in _Ballads and Lyrics of Old France_ (1872).  Though very sensible that
74,E. M. S.,"they have the demerits of imitative and even of undergraduate rhyme, I"
75,E. M. S.,print them again because people I like have liked them.  The rest are of
76,E. M. S.,"different dates, and lack (though doubtless they need) the excuse of"
77,E. M. S.,"having been written, like some of the earlier pieces, during College"
78,E. M. S.,Lectures.  I would gladly have added to this volume what other more or
79,E. M. S.,"less serious rhymes I have written, but circumstances over which I have"
80,E. M. S.,"no control have bound them up with _Ballades_, and other toys of that"
81,E. M. S.,sort.
82,E. M. S.,
83,E. M. S.,"It may be as well to repeat in prose, what has already been said in"
84,E. M. S.,"verse, that Grass of Parnassus, the pretty Autumn flower, grows in the"
85,E. M. S.,"marshes at the foot of the Muses’ Hill, and other hills, not at the top"
86,E. M. S.,by any means.
87,E. M. S.,
88,E. M. S.,Several of the versions from the Greek Anthology have been published in
89,E. M. S.,"the _Fortnightly Review_, and the sonnet on Colonel Burnaby appeared in"
90,E. M. S.,"_Punch_.  These, with pieces from other serials, are reprinted by the"
91,E. M. S.,courteous permission of the Editors.
