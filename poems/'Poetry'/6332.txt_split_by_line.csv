73,INTRODUCTION.,INTRODUCTION.
74,INTRODUCTION.,
75,INTRODUCTION.,
76,INTRODUCTION.,THE last volume of these “Companion Poets” contained some of Chaucer’s
77,INTRODUCTION.,Tales as they were modernised by Dryden.  This volume contains more of
78,INTRODUCTION.,his Tales as they were modernised by later poets.  In 1841 there was a
79,INTRODUCTION.,"volume published entitled, “The Poems of Geoffrey Chaucer Modernized.”"
80,INTRODUCTION.,"Of this volume, when it was first projected, Wordsworth wrote to Moxon,"
81,INTRODUCTION.,"his publisher, on the 24th of February 1840: “Mr. Powell, my friend, has"
82,INTRODUCTION.,some thought of preparing for publication some portion of Chaucer
83,INTRODUCTION.,"modernised, as far and no farther than is done in my treatment of ‘The"
84,INTRODUCTION.,"Prioress’ Tale.’  That would, in fact, be his model.  He will have"
85,INTRODUCTION.,"coadjutors, among whom, I believe, will be Mr. Leigh Hunt, a man as"
86,INTRODUCTION.,capable of doing the work well as any living writer.  I have placed at my
87,INTRODUCTION.,"friend Mr. Powell’s disposal three other pieces which I did long ago, but"
88,INTRODUCTION.,"revised the other day.  They are ‘The Manciple’s Tale,’ ‘The Cuckoo and"
89,INTRODUCTION.,"the Nightingale,’ and twenty-four stanzas of ‘Troilus and Cressida.’"
90,INTRODUCTION.,"This I have done mainly out of my love and reverence for Chaucer, in"
91,INTRODUCTION.,"hopes that, whatever may be the merits of Mr. Powell’s attempt, the"
92,INTRODUCTION.,attention of other writers may be drawn to the subject; and a work
93,INTRODUCTION.,"hereafter produced, by different persons, which will place the treasures"
94,INTRODUCTION.,"of one of the greatest of poets within the reach of the multitude, which"
95,INTRODUCTION.,"now they are not.  I mention all this to you because, though I have not"
96,INTRODUCTION.,"given Mr. Powell the least encouragement to do so, he may sound you as to"
97,INTRODUCTION.,your disposition to undertake the publication.  I have myself nothing
98,INTRODUCTION.,further to do with it than I have stated.  Had the thing been suggested
99,INTRODUCTION.,"to me by any number of competent persons twenty years ago, I would have"
100,INTRODUCTION.,"undertaken the editorship and done much more myself, and endeavoured to"
101,INTRODUCTION.,improve the several contributions where they seemed to require it.  But
102,INTRODUCTION.,that is now out of the question.”
103,INTRODUCTION.,
104,INTRODUCTION.,Wordsworth had made his versions of Chaucer in the year 1801.  “The
105,INTRODUCTION.,"Prioress’s Tale” had been published in 1820, so that only the three"
106,INTRODUCTION.,"pieces he had revised for his friend’s use were available, and of these"
107,INTRODUCTION.,"the Manciple’s Tale was withdrawn, the version by Leigh Hunt (which is"
108,INTRODUCTION.,among the pieces here reprinted) being used.  The volume was published in
109,INTRODUCTION.,"1841, not by Moxon but by Whitaker.  Wordsworth’s versions of “The Cuckoo"
110,INTRODUCTION.,"and the Nightingale” (here reprinted), and of a passage taken from"
111,INTRODUCTION.,"“Troilus and Cressida,” were included in it.  Leigh Hunt contributed"
112,INTRODUCTION.,versions of the Manciple’s Tale and the Friar’s Tale (both here
113,INTRODUCTION.,"reprinted), and of the Squire’s Tale.  Elizabeth A. Barrett, afterwards"
114,INTRODUCTION.,"Mrs. Browning, contributed a version of “Queen Annelida and False"
115,INTRODUCTION.,"Arcite.”  Richard Hengist Horne entered heartily into the venture,"
116,INTRODUCTION.,"modernised the Prologue to the Canterbury Tales, the Reve’s Tale, and the"
117,INTRODUCTION.,"Franklin’s, and wrote an Introduction of more than a hundred pages, to"
118,INTRODUCTION.,which Professor Leonhard Schmitz added thirty-two pages of a Life of
119,INTRODUCTION.,"Chaucer.  Robert Bell, to whom we were afterwards indebted for an"
120,INTRODUCTION.,"“Annotated Edition of the English Poets,” modernised the Complaint of"
121,INTRODUCTION.,"Mars and Venus.  Thomas Powell, the editor, contributed his version of"
122,INTRODUCTION.,"the Legends of Ariadne, Philomene, and Phillis, and of “The Flower and"
123,INTRODUCTION.,"the Leaf,” and a friend, who signed only as Z. A. Z, dealt with “The Rime"
124,INTRODUCTION.,of Sir Thopas.”
125,INTRODUCTION.,
126,INTRODUCTION.,"After the volume had appeared, Wordsworth thus wrote of it to Professor"
127,INTRODUCTION.,Henry Reed of Philadelphia: “There has recently been published in London
128,INTRODUCTION.,a volume of some of Chaucer’s tales and poems modernised; this little
129,INTRODUCTION.,"specimen originated in what I attempted with ‘The Prioress’ Tale,’ and if"
130,INTRODUCTION.,the book should find its way to America you will see in it two further
131,INTRODUCTION.,specimens from myself.  I had no further connection with the publication
132,INTRODUCTION.,"than by making a present of these to one of the contributors.  Let me,"
133,INTRODUCTION.,"however, recommend to your notice the Prologue and the Franklin’s Tale."
134,INTRODUCTION.,"They are both by Mr. Horne, a gentleman unknown to me, but are—the latter"
135,INTRODUCTION.,in particular—very well done.  Mr. Leigh Hunt has not failed in the
136,INTRODUCTION.,"Manciple’s Tale, which I myself modernised many years ago; but though I"
137,INTRODUCTION.,"much admire the genius of Chaucer as displayed in this performance, I"
138,INTRODUCTION.,"could not place my version at the disposal of the editor, as I deemed the"
139,INTRODUCTION.,subject somewhat too indelicate for pure taste to be offered to the world
140,INTRODUCTION.,at this time of day.  Mr. Horne has much hurt this publication by not
141,INTRODUCTION.,"abstaining from the Reve’s Tale.  This, after making all allowance for"
142,INTRODUCTION.,"the rude manners of Chaucer’s age, is intolerable; and by indispensably"
143,INTRODUCTION.,"softening down the incidents, he has killed the spirit of that humour,"
144,INTRODUCTION.,"gross and farcical, that pervades the original.  When the work was first"
145,INTRODUCTION.,"mentioned to me, I protested as strongly as possible against admitting"
146,INTRODUCTION.,"any coarseness and indelicacy, so that my conscience is clear of"
147,INTRODUCTION.,countenancing aught of that kind.  So great is my admiration of Chaucer’s
148,INTRODUCTION.,"genius, and so profound my reverence for him. . . for spreading the light"
149,INTRODUCTION.,"of Literature through his native land, that, notwithstanding the defects"
150,INTRODUCTION.,"and faults in this publication, I am glad of it, as a means for making"
151,INTRODUCTION.,"many acquainted with the original, who would otherwise be ignorant of"
152,INTRODUCTION.,everything about him but his name.”
153,INTRODUCTION.,
154,INTRODUCTION.,Wordsworth’s objection to the Manciple’s Tale from Ovid’s Metamorphoses
155,INTRODUCTION.,was an afterthought.  He had begun by offering his version of it for
156,INTRODUCTION.,publication in this volume.  His objection to Horne’s treatment of the
157,INTRODUCTION.,Reve’s Tale was reasonable enough.  The original tale was the sixth novel
158,INTRODUCTION.,"in the ninth day of the Decameron, and probably was taken by Chaucer from"
159,INTRODUCTION.,"a Fabliau by Jean de Boves, “De Gombert et des Deux Clercs.”  The same"
160,INTRODUCTION.,"story has been imitated in the “Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles,” and in the"
161,INTRODUCTION.,“Berceau” of La Fontaine.  Horne’s removal from the tale of everything
162,INTRODUCTION.,that would offend a modern reader was designed to enable thousands to
163,INTRODUCTION.,find pleasure in an old farcical piece that would otherwise be left
164,INTRODUCTION.,unread.
165,INTRODUCTION.,
166,INTRODUCTION.,Chaucer’s “Rime of Sir Thopas” was a playful jest on the long-winded
167,INTRODUCTION.,"story-telling of the old romances, and had specially in mind Thomas"
168,INTRODUCTION.,"Chestre’s version of Launfal from Marie of France, and the same rhymer’s"
169,INTRODUCTION.,"romance of “Ly Beaus Disconus,” who was Gingelein, a son of Gawain,"
170,INTRODUCTION.,"called by his mother, for his beauty, only Beaufis (handsome son); but"
171,INTRODUCTION.,"when he offered himself in that name to be knighted by King Arthur, he"
172,INTRODUCTION.,was knighted and named by him Li Beaus Disconus (the fair unknown).  This
173,INTRODUCTION.,"is the method of the tediousness, in which it showed itself akin to many"
174,INTRODUCTION.,a rhyming tale.
175,INTRODUCTION.,

243,INTRODUCTION.,"‘The Faire Unknowe,’"
244,INTRODUCTION.,"Certes, so hatté he.”"
245,INTRODUCTION.,
246,INTRODUCTION.,"John Gower’s “Confessio Amantis” was a story book, like the Canterbury"
247,INTRODUCTION.,"Tales, with a contrivance of its own for stringing the tales together,"
248,INTRODUCTION.,and Gower was at work on it nearly about the time when his friend Chaucer
249,INTRODUCTION.,was busy with his Pilgrims.  The story here extracted was an old
250,INTRODUCTION.,"favourite.  It appeared in Greek about the year 800, in the romance of"
251,INTRODUCTION.,Barlaam and Josaphat.  It was told by Vincent of Beauvais in the year
252,INTRODUCTION.,1290 in his “Speculum Historiale;” and it was used by Boccaccio for the
253,INTRODUCTION.,first tale of the tenth day of his “Decameron.”
254,INTRODUCTION.,
255,INTRODUCTION.,"Chaucer, Gower, Lydgate were the old poetical triumvirate, though"
256,INTRODUCTION.,"Lydgate, who was about thirty years old when Chaucer died, has slipped"
257,INTRODUCTION.,much out of mind.  His verses on the adventures of the Kentish rustic who
258,INTRODUCTION.,"came to London to get justice in the law courts, and his words set to the"
259,INTRODUCTION.,"action of an old piece of rustic mumming, “Bicorn and Chichevache,” here"
260,INTRODUCTION.,represent his vein of playfulness.  He was a monk who taught literature
261,INTRODUCTION.,"at Bury St. Edmunds, and was justly looked upon as the chief poet of the"
262,INTRODUCTION.,generation who lived after Chaucer’s death.
263,INTRODUCTION.,
264,INTRODUCTION.,Next follows in this volume a scrap of wise counsel to take life
265,INTRODUCTION.,"cheerfully, from the Scottish poet, William Dunbar.  He lived at the"
266,INTRODUCTION.,Scottish Court of James the Fourth when Henry the Seventh reigned in
267,INTRODUCTION.,"England, and who was our greatest poet of the north country before Burns."
268,INTRODUCTION.,
269,INTRODUCTION.,"Next we come to the poets “who so did please Eliza and our James,” and"
270,INTRODUCTION.,"represent their playfulness by Drayton’s “Dowsabell,” and that most"
271,INTRODUCTION.,"exquisite of fairy pieces, his “Nymphidia,” where Oberon figures as the"
272,INTRODUCTION.,"mad Orlando writ small, and Drayton earned his claim to be the Fairies’"
273,INTRODUCTION.,"Laureate, though Herrick, in the same vein, followed close upon him."
274,INTRODUCTION.,"Michael Drayton, nearly of an age with Shakespeare, was, like"
275,INTRODUCTION.,"Shakespeare, a Warwickshire man.  Empty tradition says that Shakespeare"
276,INTRODUCTION.,"died of a too festive supper shared with his friend Drayton, who came to"
277,INTRODUCTION.,visit him.
278,INTRODUCTION.,
279,INTRODUCTION.,Then follows in this volume the playful treatment of a quarrel between
280,INTRODUCTION.,"friends, in Pope’s “Rape of the Lock.”  Lord Petre, aged twenty,"
281,INTRODUCTION.,"audaciously cut from the head of Miss Arabella Fermor, daughter of Mr."
282,INTRODUCTION.,"Fermor of Tusmore, a lock of her hair while she was playing cards in the"
283,INTRODUCTION.,"Queen’s rooms at Hampton Court.  Pope’s friend, Mr. Caryll, suggested to"
284,INTRODUCTION.,him that a mock heroic treatment of the resulting quarrel might restore
285,INTRODUCTION.,"peace, and Pope wrote a poem in two cantos, which was published in a"
286,INTRODUCTION.,"Miscellany in 1712, Pope’s age then being twenty-four.  But as epic poems"
287,INTRODUCTION.,"required supernatural machinery, Pope added afterwards to his mock epic"
288,INTRODUCTION.,"the machinery of sylphs and gnomes, suggested to him by the reading of a"
289,INTRODUCTION.,"French story, “Le Comte de Gabalis,” by the Abbé Villars.  Here there"
290,INTRODUCTION.,"were sylphs of the air and gnomes of the earth, little spirits who would"
291,INTRODUCTION.,"be in right proportion to the substance of his poem, which was"
292,INTRODUCTION.,"refashioned into five cantos, and republished as we have it now in"
293,INTRODUCTION.,February 1714.
294,INTRODUCTION.,
295,INTRODUCTION.,"“John Gilpin” was written by William Cowper in the year 1782, when Lady"
296,INTRODUCTION.,"Austin was lodging in the Vicarage at Olney, and spent every evening with"
297,INTRODUCTION.,"Cowper and Mrs. Unwin, cheering Cowper greatly by her liveliness.  One"
298,INTRODUCTION.,evening she told the story of John Gilpin’s ride in a way that tickled
299,INTRODUCTION.,"the poet’s fancy, set him laughing when he woke up in the night, and"
300,INTRODUCTION.,obliged him to turn it next day into ballad rhyme.  Mrs. Unwin’s son sent
301,INTRODUCTION.,"it to the _Public Advertiser_, for the poet’s corner.  It was printed in"
302,INTRODUCTION.,"that newspaper, and thought no more of until about three years later."
303,INTRODUCTION.,"Then it was suggested to a popular actor named Henderson, who gave"
304,INTRODUCTION.,"entertainments of his own, that this piece would tell well among his"
305,INTRODUCTION.,"recitations.  He introduced it into his entertainments, and soon all the"
306,INTRODUCTION.,town was running after John Gilpin as madly as the six gentlemen and the
307,INTRODUCTION.,post-boy.
308,INTRODUCTION.,
309,INTRODUCTION.,John Gilpin’s flight is followed in this volume by the flight of Tam o’
310,INTRODUCTION.,"Shanter.  Burns wrote “Tam o’ Shanter” at Elliesland, and himself"
311,INTRODUCTION.,considered it the best of all his poems.  He told the story to Captain
312,INTRODUCTION.,"Grose, as it was current among the people in his part of the country, its"
313,INTRODUCTION.,"scene laid almost on the spot where he was born.  Captain Grose, the"
314,INTRODUCTION.,"antiquary, who was collecting materials for his “Antiquities of"
315,INTRODUCTION.,"Scotland,” published in 1789–91, got Burns to versify it and give it to"
316,INTRODUCTION.,"him.  The poem made its first appearance, therefore, in Captain Grose’s"
317,INTRODUCTION.,book.  Mrs. Burns told of it that it was the work of a day.  Burns was
318,INTRODUCTION.,"most of the day on his favourite walk by the river, where his wife and"
319,INTRODUCTION.,some of the children joined him in the afternoon.  Mrs. Burns saw that
320,INTRODUCTION.,"her husband was busily engaged “crooning to himsell,” and she loitered"
321,INTRODUCTION.,behind with the little ones among the broom.  Presently she was attracted
322,INTRODUCTION.,by the poet’s strange and wild gesticulations; he seemed agonised with an
323,INTRODUCTION.,ungovernable joy.  He was reciting very loud.  Every circumstance
324,INTRODUCTION.,"suggested to heighten the impression of fear in the lines following,"
325,INTRODUCTION.,
326,INTRODUCTION.,“By this time he was ’cross the ford
327,INTRODUCTION.,"Where in the snaw the chapman smoored,” etc.,"
328,INTRODUCTION.,
329,INTRODUCTION.,was taken from local tradition.  Shanter was the real name of a farm near
330,INTRODUCTION.,"Kirkoswald, then occupied by a Douglas Grahame, who was much of Tam’s"
331,INTRODUCTION.,"character, and was well content to be called by his country neighbours"
332,INTRODUCTION.,"Tam o’ Shanter for the rest of his life, after Burns had made the name of"
333,INTRODUCTION.,the farm immortal.
334,INTRODUCTION.,
335,INTRODUCTION.,"Our selection ends with two pieces by Thomas Hood, whose “Tale of a"
336,INTRODUCTION.,Trumpet” is luxuriant with play of wit that has its earnest side.  Hood
337,INTRODUCTION.,died in 1845.
338,INTRODUCTION.,
339,INTRODUCTION.,"A Note upon the Game of Ombre is added, which is founded upon the"
340,INTRODUCTION.,description of the game in a little book—“The Court Gamester”—which
341,INTRODUCTION.,instructed card-players in the reigns of the first Georges.  In the “Rape
342,INTRODUCTION.,of the Lock” there is a game of ombre played through to the last trick.
343,INTRODUCTION.,That note will enable any reader to follow Belinda’s play.  It will also
344,INTRODUCTION.,enable any one who may care to do so to restore to a place among our home
345,INTRODUCTION.,"amusements a game which carried all before it in Queen Anne’s day, and"
346,INTRODUCTION.,"which is really, when cleared of its gambling details, as good a domestic"
347,INTRODUCTION.,game for three players as cribbage or piquet is for two.  My “Court
348,INTRODUCTION.,"Gamester,” which was in its fifth edition in 1728, after devoting its"
349,INTRODUCTION.,"best energies to ombre, contented its readers in fewer pages with the"
350,INTRODUCTION.,addition only of piquet and chess.
351,INTRODUCTION.,
352,INTRODUCTION.,"Obsolete words and words of Scottish dialect, with a few more as to the"
353,INTRODUCTION.,"meaning of which some readers might be uncertain, will be found explained"

1247,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,“Where ridest thou under the greenwood tree?
1248,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Goest thou far, thou jolly boy, to-day?”"
1249,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"This bully Sumner answered, and said, “Nay,"
1250,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Only hard-by, to strain a rent.”—“Hoh! hoh!"
1251,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Art thou a bailiff then?”—“Yea, even so.”"
1252,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"For he durst not, for very filth and shame,"
1253,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Say that he was a Sumner, for the name."
1254,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Well met, in God’s name,” quoth black fringe; “why, brother,"
1255,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Thou art a bailiff then, and I’m another;"
1256,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"But I’m a stranger in these parts; so, prythee,"
1257,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Lend me thine aid, and let me journey with thee."
1258,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"I’ve gold and silver, plenty, where I dwell;"
1259,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And if thou hap’st to come into our dell,"
1260,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Lord! how we’ll do our best to give thee greeting!”
1261,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Thanks,” quoth the Sumner; “merry be our meeting.”"
1262,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"So in each other’s hand their troths they lay,"
1263,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,And swear accord: and forth they ride and play.
1264,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1265,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"This Sumner then, which was as full of stir,"
1266,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And prate, and prying, as a woodpecker,"
1267,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And ever inquiring upon everything,"
1268,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Said, “Brother, where is thine inhabiting,"
1269,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,In case I come to find thee out some day?”
1270,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1271,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"This yeoman dropped his speech in a soft way,"
1272,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And said, “Far in the north.  But ere we part, {42}"
1273,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"I trow thou shalt have learnt it so by heart,"
1274,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Thou mayst not miss it, be it dark as pitch.”"
1275,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1276,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Good,” quoth the Sumner. “Now, as thou art rich,"
1277,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Show me, dear brother, riding thus with me,"
1278,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Since we are bailiffs both, some subtlety,"
1279,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"How I may play my game best, and may win:"
1280,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And spare not, pray, for conscience or for sin,"
1281,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"But, as my brother, tell me how do ye.”"
1282,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1283,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Why, ’faith, to tell thee a plain tale,” quoth he,"
1284,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“As to my wages, they be poor enough;"
1285,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"My lord’s a dangerous master, hard and chuff;"
1286,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And since my labour bringeth but abortion,"
1287,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"I live, so please ye, brother, by extortion,"
1288,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,I take what I can get; that is my course;
1289,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"By cunning, if I may; if not, by force;"
1290,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"So cometh, year by year, my salary.”"
1291,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Now certes,” quote the Sumner, “so fare I."
1292,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"I lay my hands on everything, God wot,"
1293,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Unless it be too heavy or too hot.
1294,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"What I may get in counsel, privily,"
1295,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"I feel no sort of qualm thereon, not I."
1296,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Extortion or starvation;—that’s my creed.
1297,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Repent who list.  The best of saints must feed.
1298,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,That’s all the stomach that my conscience knoweth.
1299,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Curse on the ass that to confession goeth.
1300,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Well be we met, ’Od’s heart! and by my dame!"
1301,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"But tell me, brother dear, what is thy name?”"
1302,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1303,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Now ye must know, that right in this meanwhile,"
1304,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,This yeoman ’gan a little for to smile.
1305,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Brother,” quoth he, “my name, if I must tell—"
1306,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,I am a fiend: my dwelling is in hell:
1307,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And here I ride about my fortuning,"
1308,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,To wot if folk will give me anything.
1309,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"To that sole end ride I, and ridest thou;"
1310,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And, without pulling rein, will I ride now"
1311,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"To the world’s end, ere I will lose a prey.”"
1312,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1313,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“God bless me,” quoth the Sumner, “what d’ye say?"
1314,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,I thought ye were a yeoman verily.
1315,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Ye have a man’s shape, sir, as well as I."
1316,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Have ye a shape then, pray, determinate"
1317,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"In hell, good sir, where ye have your estate?”"
1318,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1319,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Nay, certainly,” quoth he, “there have we none;"
1320,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"But whoso liketh it, he taketh one;"
1321,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,And so we make folk think us what we please.
1322,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Sometimes we go like apes, sometimes like bees,"
1323,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Like man, or angel, black dog, or black crow:—"
1324,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Nor is it wondrous that it should be so.
1325,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,A sorry juggler can bewilder thee;
1326,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And ’faith, I think I know more craft than he.”"
1327,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1328,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“But why,” inquired the Sumner, “must ye don"
1329,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"So many shapes, when ye might stick to one?”"
1330,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“We suit the bait unto the fish,” quoth he."
1331,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“And why,” quoth t’other, “all this slavery?”"
1332,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“For many a cause, Sir Sumner,” quoth the fiend;"
1333,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,“But time is brief—the day will have an end;
1334,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And here jog I, with nothing for my ride;"
1335,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Catch we our fox, and let this theme abide:"
1336,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"For, brother mine, thy wit it is too small"
1337,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"To understand me, though I told thee all;"
1338,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And yet, as toucheth that same slavery,"
1339,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"A devil must do God’s work, ’twixt you and me;"
1340,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"For without Him, albeit to our loathing,"
1341,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Strong as we go, we devils can do nothing;"
1342,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Though to our prayers, sometimes, He giveth leave"
1343,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Only the body, not the soul, to grieve."
1344,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Witness good Job, whom nothing could make wrath;"
1345,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,And sometimes have we power to harass both;
1346,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And, then again, soul only is possest,"
1347,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,And body free; and all is for the best.
1348,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Full many a sinner would have no salvation,"
1349,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Gat it he not by standing our temptation:
1350,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Though God He knows, ’twas far from our intent"
1351,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,To save the man:—his howl was what we meant.
1352,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Nay, sometimes we be servants to our foes:"
1353,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Witness the saint that pulled my master’s nose;
1354,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,And to the apostle servant eke was I.”
1355,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Yet tell me,” quoth this Sumner, “faithfully,"
1356,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Are the new shapes ye take for your intents
1357,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Fresh every time, and wrought of elements?”"
1358,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Nay,” quoth the fiend, “sometimes they be disguises;"
1359,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And sometimes in a corpse a devil rises,"
1360,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And speaks as sensibly, and fair, and well,"
1361,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,As did the Pythoness to Samuel:
1362,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And yet will some men say, it was not he!"
1363,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Lord help, say I, this world’s divinity."
1364,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Of one thing make thee sure; that thou shalt know,"
1365,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Before we part, the shapes we wear below."
1366,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Thou shalt—I jest thee not—the Lord forbid!
1367,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Thou shalt know more than ever Virgil did,"
1368,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Or Dante’s self.  So let us on, sweet brother,"
1369,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And stick, like right warm souls, to one another:"
1370,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"I’ll never quit thee, till thou quittest me.”"
1371,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1372,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Nay,” quoth the Sumner, “that can never be;"
1373,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"I am a man well known, respectable;"
1374,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And though thou wert the very lord of hell,"
1375,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Hold thee I should as mine own plighted brother:
1376,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Doubt not we’ll stick right fast, each to the other:"
1377,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And, as we think alike, so will we thrive:"
1378,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,We twain will be the merriest devils alive.
1379,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Take thou what’s given; for that’s thy mode, God wot;"
1380,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And I will take, whether ’tis given or not."
1381,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And if that either winneth more than t’other,"
1382,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Let him be true, and share it with his brother.”"
1383,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1384,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Done,” quoth the fiend, whose eyes in secret glowed;"
1385,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,And with that word they pricked along the road:
1386,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And soon it fell, that entering the town’s end,"
1387,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"To which this Sumner shaped him for to wend,"
1388,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"They saw a cart that loaded was with hay,"
1389,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,The which a carter drove forth on his way.
1390,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Deep was the mire, and sudden the cart stuck:"
1391,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"The carter, like a madman, smote and struck,"
1392,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And cried, “Heit, Scot; heit, Brock!  What! is’t the stones?"
1393,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"The devil clean fetch ye both, body and bones:"
1394,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Must I do nought but bawl and swinge all day?
1395,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Devil take the whole—horse, harness, cart, and hay.”"
1396,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1397,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"The Sumner whispered to the fiend, “I’ faith,"
1398,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,We have it here.  Hear’st thou not what he saith?
1399,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Take it anon, for he hath given it thee,"
1400,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Live stock and dead, hay, cart, and horses three!”"
1401,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1402,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Nay,” quoth the fiend, “not so;—the deuce a bit."
1403,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"He sayeth; but, alas! not meaneth it:"
1404,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Ask him thyself, if thou believ’st not me;"
1405,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Or else be still awhile, and thou shalt see.”"
1406,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1407,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Thwacketh the man his horses on the croup,"
1408,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And they begin to draw now, and to stoop."
1409,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“_Heit_ there,” quoth he; “_heit_, _heit_; ah, _matthywo_."
1410,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Lord love their hearts! how prettily they go!
1411,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"That was well twitched, methinks, mine own grey boy:"
1412,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"I pray God save thy body, and Saint Eloy."
1413,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Now is my cart out of the slough, _pardie_.”"
1414,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1415,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“There,” quoth the fiend unto the Sumner; “see,"
1416,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"I told thee how ’twould fall.  Thou seest, dear brother,"
1417,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"The churl spoke one thing, but he thought another."
1418,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Let us prick on, for we take nothing here.”"
1419,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1420,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And when from out the town they had got clear,"
1421,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"The Sumner said, “Here dwelleth an old witch,"
1422,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,That had as lief be tumbled in a ditch
1423,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And break her neck, as part with an old penny."
1424,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Nathless her twelve pence is as good as any,"
1425,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And I will have it, though she lose her wits;"
1426,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Or else I’ll cite her with a score of writs:
1427,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And yet, God wot, I know of her no vice."
1428,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"So learn of me, Sir Fiend: thou art too nice.”"
1429,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1430,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,The Sumner clappeth at the widow’s gate.
1431,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Come out,” he saith, “thou hag, thou quiver-pate:"
1432,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,I trow thou hast some friar or priest with thee.”
1433,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Who clappeth?” said this wife; “ah, what say ye?"
1434,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"God save ye, masters: what is your sweet will?”"
1435,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“I have,” said he, “of summons here a bill:"
1436,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Take care, on pain of cursing, that thou be"
1437,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"To-morrow morn, before the Archdeacon’s knee,"
1438,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,To answer to the court of certain things.”
1439,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1440,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Now, Lord,” quoth she, “sweet Jesu, King of kings,"
1441,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"So help me, as I cannot, sirs, nor may:"
1442,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"I have been sick, and that full many a day."
1443,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"I may not walk such distance, nay, nor ride,"
1444,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"But I be dead, so pricketh it my side."
1445,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,La! how I cough and quiver when I stir!—
1446,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,May I not ask some worthy officer
1447,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"To speak for me, to what the bill may say?”"
1448,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1449,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Yea, certainly,” this Sumner said, “ye may,"
1450,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,On paying—let me see—twelve pence anon.
1451,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Small profit cometh to myself thereon:
1452,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"My master hath the profit, and not I."
1453,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Come—twelve pence, mother—count it speedily,"
1454,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,And let me ride: I may no longer tarry.”
1455,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1456,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,“Twelve pence!” quoth she; “now may the sweet Saint Mary
1457,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"So wisely help me out of care and sin,"
1458,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"As in this wide world, though I sold my skin,"
1459,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"I could not scrape up twelve pence, for my life."
1460,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Ye know too well I am a poor old wife:
1461,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Give alms, for the Lord’s sake, to me, poor wretch.”"
1462,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1463,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Nay, if I quit thee then,” quoth he, “devil fetch"
1464,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Myself, although thou starve for it, and rot.”"
1465,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Alas!” quoth she, “the pence I have ’em not.”"
1466,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Pay me,” quoth he, “or by the sweet Saint Anne,"
1467,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,I’ll bear away thy staff and thy new pan
1468,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"For the old debt thou ow’st me for that fee,"
1469,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Which out of pocket I discharged for thee,"
1470,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,When thou didst make thy husband an old stag.”
1471,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Thou liest,” quoth she; “so leave me never a rag,"
1472,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"As I was never yet, widow nor wife,"
1473,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Summonsed before your court in all my life,"
1474,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Nor never of my body was untrue.
1475,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Unto the devil, rough and black of hue,"
1476,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Give I thy body, and the pan to boot.”"
1477,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1478,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,And when this devil heard her give the brute
1479,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Thus in his charge, he stooped into her ear,"
1480,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And said, “Now, Mabily, my mother dear,"
1481,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Is this your will in earnest that ye say?”
1482,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“The devil,” quoth she, “so fetch him cleanaway,"
1483,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Soul, pan, and all, unless that he repent.”"
1484,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Repent!” the Sumner cried; “pay up your rent,"
1485,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Old fool; and don’t stand preaching here to me.
1486,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"I would I had thy whole inventory,"
1487,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"The smock from off thy back, and every cloth.”"
1488,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,
1489,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"“Now, brother,” quoth the devil, “be not wroth;"
1490,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Thy body and this pan be mine by right,"
1491,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"And thou shalt straight to hell with me to-night,"
1492,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,"Where thou shalt know what sort of folk we be,"
1493,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,Better than Oxford university.”
1494,MODERNISED BY LEIGH HUNT.,

1558,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,
1559,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,"When that our Host had heard this sermoning,"
1560,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,He gan to speak as lordly as a king;
1561,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,"And said, “Why, what amounteth all this wit?"
1562,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,What! shall we speak all day of Holy Writ?
1563,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,"The devil can make a steward fit to preach,"
1564,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,"Or of a cobbler a sailor, or a leech."
1565,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,Say forth thy tale; and tarry not the time.
1566,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,Lo Deptford! and the hour is half-way prime:
1567,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,Lo Greenwich! there where many a shrew loves sin—
1568,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,It were high time thy story to begin.”
1569,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,
1570,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,"“Now, fair sirs,” quoth this Oswald, the old Reve,"
1571,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,"“I pray you all that you yourselves ne’er grieve,"
1572,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,Though my reply should somewhat fret his nose;
1573,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,"For lawful ’tis with force, force to oppose."
1574,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,This drunken Miller hath informed us here
1575,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,How that some folks beguiled a carpenter—
1576,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,Perhaps in scorn that I of yore was one.
1577,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,"So, by your leave, him I’ll requite anon."
1578,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,"In his own churlish language will I speak,"
1579,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,And pray to Heaven besides his neck may break.
1580,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,"A small stalk in mine eye he sees, I deem,"
1581,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,But in his own he cannot see a beam.”
1582,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,
1583,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,
1584,_THE REVE’S PROLOGUE_.,
1585,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,_THE REVE’S TALE_.
1586,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1587,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1588,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"At Trumpington, near Cambridge, if you look,"
1589,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"There goeth a bridge, and under that a brook,"
1590,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Upon which brook there stood a flour-mill;
1591,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And this is a known fact that now I tell.
1592,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,A Miller there had dwelt for many a day;
1593,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,As any peacock he was proud and gay.
1594,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"He could pipe well, and fish, mend nets, to boot,"
1595,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Turn cups with a lathe, and wrestle well, and shoot."
1596,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"A Norman dirk, as brown as is a spade,"
1597,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Hung by his belt, and eke a trenchant blade."
1598,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,A jolly dagger bare he in his pouch:
1599,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"There was no man, for peril, durst him touch."
1600,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,A Sheffield clasp-knife lay within his hose.
1601,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Round was his face, and broad and flat his nose."
1602,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,High and retreating was his bald ape’s skull:
1603,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,He swaggered when the market-place was full.
1604,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"There durst no wight a hand lift to resent it,"
1605,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"But soon, this Miller swore, he should repent it."
1606,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1607,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"A thief he was, forsooth, of corn and meal,"
1608,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"A sly one, too, and used long since to steal."
1609,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Disdainful Simkin was he called by name.
1610,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,A wife he had; of noble kin she came:
1611,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,The rector of the town her father was.
1612,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"With her he gave full many a pan of brass,"
1613,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,That Simkin with his blood should thus ally.
1614,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,She had been brought up in a nunnery;
1615,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"For Simkin ne’er would take a wife, he said,"
1616,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Unless she were well tutored and a maid,"
1617,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,To carry on his line of yeomanry:
1618,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And she was proud and pert as is a pie.
1619,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,It was a pleasant thing to see these two:
1620,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"On holidays before her he would go,"
1621,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,With his large tippet bound about his head;
1622,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"While she came after in a gown of red,"
1623,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And Simkin wore his long hose of the same.
1624,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,There durst no wight address her but as dame:
1625,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,None was so bold that passed along the way
1626,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Who with her durst once toy or jesting play,"
1627,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Unless he wished the sudden loss of life
1628,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Before Disdainful Simkin’s sword or knife.
1629,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,(For jealous folk most fierce and perilous grow;
1630,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And this they always wish their wives to know.)
1631,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,But since that to broad jokes she’d no dislike
1632,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"She was as pure as water in a dyke,"
1633,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And with abuse all filled and froward air.
1634,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"She thought that ladies should her temper bear,"
1635,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Both for her kindred and the lessons high
1636,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,That had been taught her in the nunnery.
1637,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1638,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"These two a fair and buxom daughter had,"
1639,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Of twenty years; no more since they were wed,"
1640,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Saving a child, that was but six months old;"
1641,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,A little boy in cradle rocked and rolled.
1642,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"This daughter was a stout and well-grown lass,"
1643,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"With broad flat nose, and eyes as grey as glass."
1644,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Broad were her hips; her bosom round and high;
1645,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,But right fair was she here—I will not lie.
1646,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1647,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"The rector of the town, as she was fair,"
1648,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"A purpose had to make her his sole heir,"
1649,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Both of his cattle and his tenement;
1650,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,But only if she married as he meant.
1651,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"It was his purpose to bestow her high,"
1652,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Into some worthy blood of ancestry:
1653,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,For holy Church’s good must be expended
1654,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,On holy Church’s blood that is descended;
1655,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Therefore he would his holy Church honour,"
1656,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Although that holy Church he should devour.
1657,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1658,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Great toll and fee had Simkin, out of doubt,"
1659,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"With wheat and malt, of all the land about,"
1660,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And in especial was the Soler Hall—
1661,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,A college great at Cambridge thus they call—
1662,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Which at this mill both wheat and malt had ground.
1663,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And on a day it suddenly was found,"
1664,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Sick lay the Manciple of a malady;
1665,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And men for certain thought that he must die.
1666,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Whereon this Miller both of corn and meal
1667,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,An hundred times more than before did steal;
1668,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"For, ere this chance, he stole but courteously,"
1669,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,But now he was a thief outrageously.
1670,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,The Warden scolded with an angry air;
1671,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,But this the Miller rated not a tare:
1672,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"He sang high bass, and swore it was not so!"
1673,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1674,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"There were two scholars young, and poor, I trow,"
1675,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,That dwelt within the Hall of which I say.
1676,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Headstrong they were and lusty for to play;
1677,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And merely for their mirth and revelry,"
1678,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Out to the Warden eagerly they cry,"
1679,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"That be should let them, for a merry round,"
1680,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Go to the mill and see their own corn ground,"
1681,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And each would fair and boldly lay his neck
1682,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,The Miller should not steal them half a peck
1683,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Of corn by sleight, nor by main force bereave."
1684,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1685,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And at the last the Warden gave them leave:
1686,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"One was called John, and Allen named the other;"
1687,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"From the same town they came, which was called Strauther,"
1688,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Far in the North—I cannot tell you where.
1689,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1690,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"This Allen maketh ready all his gear,"
1691,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And on a horse the sack he cast anon:
1692,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Forth go these merry clerks, Allen and John,"
1693,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,With good sword and with buckler by their side.
1694,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"John knew the way, and needed not a guide;"
1695,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And at the mill the sack adown he layeth.
1696,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1697,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Allen spake first:—“Simon, all hail! in faith,"
1698,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"How fares thy daughter, and thy worthy wife?”"
1699,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Allen,” quoth Simkin, “welcome, by my life;"
1700,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And also John:—how now! what do ye here?”
1701,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Simon,” quoth John, “compulsion has no peer."
1702,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"They who’ve nae lackeys must themselves bestir,"
1703,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Or else they are but fools, as clerks aver."
1704,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Our Manciple, I think, will soon be dead,"
1705,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Sae slowly work the grinders in his head;
1706,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And therefore am I come with Allen thus,"
1707,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"To grind our corn, and carry it hame with us:"
1708,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"I pray you speed us, that we may be gone.”"
1709,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1710,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Quoth Simkin, “By my faith it shall be done;"
1711,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,What will ye do while that it is in hand?”
1712,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Gude’s life! right by the hopper will I stand,”"
1713,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"(Quoth John), “and see how that the corn goes in."
1714,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"I never yet saw, by my father’s kin,"
1715,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,How that the hopper waggles to and fro.”
1716,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1717,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Allen continued,—“John, and wilt thou so?"
1718,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Then will I be beneath it, by my crown,"
1719,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And see how that the meal comes running down
1720,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Into the trough—and that shall be my sport.
1721,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"For, John, like you, I’m of the curious sort;"
1722,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And quite as bad a miller—so let’s see!”
1723,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1724,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"This Miller smiled at their ’cute nicety,"
1725,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And thought,—all this is done but for a wile;"
1726,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,They fancy that no man can them beguile:
1727,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"But, by my thrift, I’ll dust their searching eye,"
1728,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,For all the sleights in their philosophy.
1729,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"The more quaint knacks and guarded plans they make,"
1730,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,The more corn will I steal when once I take:
1731,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Instead of flour, I’ll leave them nought but bran:"
1732,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,The greatest clerks are not the wisest men.
1733,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,As whilom to the wolf thus spake the mare:
1734,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Of all their art I do not count a tare.
1735,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1736,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Out at the door he goeth full privily,"
1737,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"When that he saw his time, and noiselessly:"
1738,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"He looketh up and down, till he hath found"
1739,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"The clerks’ bay horse, where he was standing bound"
1740,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Under an ivy wall, behind the mill:"
1741,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And to the horse he goeth him fair and well,"
1742,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And strippeth off the bridle in a trice.
1743,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1744,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And when the horse was loose he ’gan to race
1745,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Unto the wild mares wandering in the fen,"
1746,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,With _wehee_! _whinny_! right through thick and thin!
1747,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"This Miller then returned; no word he said,"
1748,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"But doth his work, and with these clerks he played,"
1749,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Till that their corn was well and fairly ground.
1750,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And when the meal is sacked and safely bound
1751,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"John goeth out, and found his horse was gone,"
1752,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And cried aloud with many a stamp and groan,"
1753,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Our horse is lost!  Allen, ’od’s banes! I say,"
1754,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Up on thy feet!—come off, man—up, away!"
1755,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Alas! our Warden’s palfrey, it is gone!”"
1756,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1757,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Allen at once forgot both meal and corn—
1758,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Out of his mind went all his husbandry—
1759,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,“What! whilk way is he gone?” he ’gan to cry.
1760,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1761,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"The Miller’s wife came laughing inwardly,"
1762,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Alas!” said she, “your horse i’ the fens doth fly"
1763,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,After wild mares as fast as he can go!
1764,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Ill-luck betide the man that bound him so,"
1765,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And his that better should have knit the rein.”
1766,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1767,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Alas!” quoth John, “good Allen, haste amain;"
1768,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Lay down thy sword, as I will mine also;"
1769,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Heaven knoweth I am as nimble as a roe;
1770,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"He shall not ’scape us baith, or my saul’s dead!"
1771,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Why didst not put the horse within the shed?
1772,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"By the mass, Allen, thou’rt a fool, I say!”"
1773,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1774,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Those silly clerks have scampered fast away
1775,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Unto the fen; Allen and nimble John:
1776,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And when the Miller saw that they were gone,"
1777,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"He half a bushel of their flour doth take,"
1778,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And bade his wife go knead it in a cake.
1779,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"He said, “I trow these clerks feared what they’ve found;"
1780,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Yet can a miller turn a scholar round
1781,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"For all his art.  Yea, let them go their way!"
1782,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"See where they run! yea, let the children play:"
1783,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"They get him not so lightly, by my crown.”"
1784,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1785,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"The simple clerks go running up and down,"
1786,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"With “Soft, soft!—stand, stand!—hither!—back! take care!"
1787,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Now whistle thou, and I shall keep him here!”"
1788,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"But, to be brief, until the very night"
1789,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"They could not, though they tried with all their might,"
1790,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,The palfrey catch; he always ran so fast:
1791,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Till in a ditch they caught him at the last.
1792,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1793,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Weary and wet as beasts amid the rain,"
1794,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Allen and John come slowly back again.
1795,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Alas,” quoth John, “that ever I was born!"
1796,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Now are we turned into contempt and scorn.
1797,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Our corn is stolen; fools they will us call;
1798,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"The Warden, and our college fellows all,"
1799,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And ’specially the Miller—’las the day!”
1800,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1801,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Thus plaineth John while going by the way
1802,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Toward the mill, the bay nag in his hand."
1803,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"The Miller sitting by the fire they found,"
1804,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,For it was night: no further could they move;
1805,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"But they besought him, for Heaven’s holy love,"
1806,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Lodgment and food to give them for their penny.
1807,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1808,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And Simkin answered, “If that there be any,"
1809,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Such as it is, yet shall ye have your part."
1810,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"My house is small, but ye have learnéd art;"
1811,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Ye can, by arguments, well make a place"
1812,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"A mile broad, out of twenty foot of space!"
1813,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Let’s see now if this place, as ’tis, suffice;"
1814,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Or make more room with speech, as is your guise.”"
1815,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Now, Simon, by Saint Cuthbert,” said this John,"
1816,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Thou’rt ever merry, and that’s answered soon."
1817,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,I’ve heard that man must needs choose o’ twa things;
1818,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Such as he finds, or else such as he brings."
1819,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"But specially I pray thee, mine host dear,"
1820,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Let us have meat and drink, and make us cheer,"
1821,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And we shall pay you to the full, be sure:"
1822,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,With empty hand men may na’ hawks allure.
1823,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Lo! here’s our siller ready to be spent!”
1824,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1825,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,The Miller to the town his daughter sent
1826,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"For ale and bread, and roasted them a goose;"
1827,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And bound their horse; he should no more get loose;
1828,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And in his own room made for them a bed,"
1829,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"With blankets, sheets, and coverlet well spread:"
1830,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Not twelve feet from his own bed did it stand.
1831,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"His daughter, by herself, as it was planned,"
1832,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"In a small passage closet, slept close by:"
1833,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"It might no better be, for reasons why,—"
1834,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,There was no wider chamber in the place.
1835,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"They sup, and jest, and show a merry face,"
1836,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And drink of ale, the strongest and the best."
1837,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,It was just midnight when they went to rest.
1838,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1839,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Well hath this Simkin varnished his hot head;
1840,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Full pale he was with drinking, and nought red."
1841,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"He hiccougheth, and speaketh through the nose,"
1842,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"As with the worst of colds, or quinsy’s throes."
1843,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"To bed he goeth, and with him trips his wife;"
1844,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Light as a jay, and jolly seemed her life,"
1845,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,So was her jolly whistle well ywet.
1846,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,The cradle at her bed’s foot close she set
1847,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"To rock, or nurse the infant in the night."
1848,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And when the jug of ale was emptied quite,"
1849,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"To bed, likewise, the daughter went anon:"
1850,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,To bed goes Allen; with him also John.
1851,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"All’s said: they need no drugs from poppies pale,"
1852,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,This Miller hath so wisely bibbed of ale;
1853,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"But as an horse he snorteth in his sleep,"
1854,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And blurteth secrets which awake he’d keep.

1864,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Wha ever listened to sae strange a thing?

1872,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"That if a man in one point be aggrieved,"
1873,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Right in another he shall be relieved:
1874,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Our corn is stolen—sad yet sooth to say—
1875,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And we have had an evil bout to-day;
1876,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"But since the Miller no amends will make,"

1886,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Nay,” Allen said, “I count him not a flie!”"
1887,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And up he rose, and crept along the floor"
1888,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Into the passage humming with their snore:
1889,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,As narrow was it as a drum or tub.
1890,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And like a beetle doth he grope and grub,"

1898,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Allen may somewhat quit him for his wrong:

1900,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"So shall his ’venture happily be sped,"
1901,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,While like a rubbish-sack I lie in bed;
1902,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And when this jape is told another day,"

1905,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"‘Weak heart, worse fortune,’ as the proverb saith.”"
1906,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1907,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And up he rose at once, and softly went"
1908,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Unto the cradle, as ’twas his intent,"
1909,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And to his bed’s foot bare it, with the brat."
1910,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"The wife her routing ceased soon after that,"
1911,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And woke, and left her bed; for she was pained"

1918,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Alas,” quoth she, “I had almost misgone!"
1919,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,I well-nigh stumbled on the clerks a-bed:
1920,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,_Eh benedicite_! but I am safely sped.”
1921,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And on she went, till she the cradle found,"
1922,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,While through the dark still groping with her hand.
1923,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1924,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Meantime was heard the beating of a wing,"
1925,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And then the third cock of the morn ’gan sing.
1926,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Allen stole back, and thought, “Ere that it dawn"
1927,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,I will creep in by John that lieth forlorn.”
1928,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"He found the cradle in his hand, anon."
1929,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Gude Lord!” thought Allen, “all wrong have I gone!"
1930,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"My head is dizzy with the ale last night,"
1931,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And eke my piping, that I go not right."

1933,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Here lieth Simkin, and his wife alsó.”"
1934,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And, scrambling forthright on, he made his way"
1935,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Unto the bed where Simkin snoring lay!
1936,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"He thought to nestle by his fellow John,"
1937,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And by the Miller in he crept, anon,"
1938,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And caught him by the neck, and ’gan to shake,"
1939,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And said, “Thou John! thou swine’s head dull, awake!"
1940,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Wake, by the mass! and hear a noble game,"
1941,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"For, by St. Andrew! to thy ruth and shame,"
1942,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"I have been trolling roundelays this night,"
1943,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And won the Miller’s daughter’s heart outright,"
1944,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Who hath me told where hidden is our meal:
1945,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,All this—and more—and how they always steal;
1946,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,While thou hast as a coward lain aghast!”
1947,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1948,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Thou slanderous ribald!” quoth the Miller, “hast?"
1949,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"A traitor false, false lying clerk!” quoth he,"
1950,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Thou shalt be slain by heaven’s dignity,"
1951,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Who rudely dar’st disparage with foul lie
1952,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,My daughter that is come of lineage high!”
1953,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And by the throat he Allen grasped amain;
1954,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And caught him, yet more furiously, again,"
1955,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And on his nose he smote him with his fist!
1956,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Down ran the bloody stream upon his breast,"
1957,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And on the floor they tumble, heel and crown,"
1958,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And shake the house—it seemed all coming down.
1959,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And up they rise, and down again they roll;"
1960,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Till that the Miller, stumbling o’er a coal,"
1961,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Went plunging headlong like a bull at bait,"
1962,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And met his wife, and both fell flat as slate."
1963,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“Help, holy cross of Bromeholm!” loud she cried,"
1964,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"“And all ye martyrs, fight upon my side!"
1965,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,_In manus tuas_—help!—on thee I call!
1966,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Simon, awake! the fiend on me doth fall:"
1967,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,He crusheth me—help!—I am well-nigh dead:
1968,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"He lieth along my heart, and heels, and head."
1969,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Help, Simkin! for the false clerks rage and fight!”"
1970,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,
1971,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Now sprang up John as fast as ever he might,"
1972,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And graspeth by the dark walls to and fro
1973,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,To find a staff: the wife starts up alsó.
1974,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"She knew the place far better than this John,"
1975,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,And by the wall she caught a staff anon.
1976,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"She saw a little shimmering of a light,"
1977,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"For at an hole in shone the moon all bright,"
1978,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And by that gleam she saw the struggling two,"
1979,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"But knew not, as for certain, who was who,"
1980,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Save that she saw a white thing in her eye.
1981,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And when that she this white thing ’gan espy,"
1982,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"She thought that Allen did a nightcap wear,"
1983,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And with the staff she drew near, and more near,"
1984,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And, thinking ’twas the clerk, she smote at full"
1985,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,Disdainful Simkin on his bald ape’s skull.
1986,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"Down goes the Miller, crying, “Harow, I die!”"
1987,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"These clerks they beat him well, and let him lie."
1988,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"They make them ready, and take their horse anon,"
1989,_THE REVE’S TALE_.,"And eke their meal, and on their way are gone;"

3553,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,He calleth for a ferry;
3554,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Where you may some recovery note;
3555,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"What was his club he made his boat,"
3556,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And in his oaken cup doth float,"
3557,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,As safe as in a wherry.
3558,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3559,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Men talk of the adventures strange
3560,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Of Don Quixoit, and of their change"
3561,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Through which he arméd oft did range,"
3562,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Of Sancho Pancha’s travel;
3563,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,But should a man tell every thing
3564,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Done by this frantic Fairy King,"
3565,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And them in lofty numbers sing,"
3566,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,It well his wits might gravel.
3567,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3568,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Scarce set on shore, but therewithal"
3569,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"He meeteth Puck, which most men call"
3570,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Hobgoblin, and on him doth fall,"
3571,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,With words from frenzy spoken:
3572,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"“Oh, oh,” quoth Hob, “God save thy grace!"
3573,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Who drest thee in this piteous case?
3574,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"He thus that spoiled my sovereign’s face,"
3575,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,I would his neck were broken!”
3576,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3577,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"This Puck seems but a dreaming dolt,"
3578,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Still walking like a ragged colt,"
3579,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And oft out of a bush doth bolt,"
3580,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Of purpose to deceive us;
3581,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And leading us makes us to stray,"
3582,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Long winter’s nights, out of the way;"
3583,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And when we stick in mire and clay,"
3584,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Hob doth with laughter leave us.
3585,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3586,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"“Dear Puck,” quoth he, “my wife is gone:"
3587,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"As e’er thou lov’st King Oberon,"
3588,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Let everything but this alone,"
3589,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,With vengeance and pursue her;
3590,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Bring her to me alive or dead,"
3591,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Or that vile thief, Pigwiggin’s head,"
3592,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,That villain hath [my Queen misled];
3593,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,He to this folly drew her.”
3594,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3595,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Quoth Puck, “My liege, I’ll never lin,"
3596,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"But I will thorough thick and thin,"
3597,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Until at length I bring her in;
3598,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"My dearest lord, ne’er doubt it.”"
3599,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Thorough brake, thorough briar,"
3600,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Thorough muck, thorough mire,"
3601,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Thorough water, thorough fire;"
3602,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And thus goes Puck about it.
3603,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3604,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"This thing Nymphidia overheard,"
3605,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"That on this mad king had a guard,"
3606,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Not doubting of a great reward,"
3607,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,For first this business broaching;
3608,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And through the air away doth go,"
3609,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Swift as an arrow from the bow,"
3610,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,To let her sovereign Mab to know
3611,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,What peril was approaching.
3612,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3613,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"The Queen, bound with Love’s powerful charm,"
3614,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Sate with Pigwiggin arm in arm;
3615,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Her merry maids, that thought no harm,"
3616,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,About the room were skipping;
3617,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"A humble-bee, their minstrel, played"
3618,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Upon his hautboy, every maid"
3619,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Fit for this revel was arrayed,"
3620,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,The hornpipe neatly tripping.
3621,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3622,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"In comes Nymphidia, and doth cry,"
3623,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"“My sovereign, for your safety fly,"
3624,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,For there is danger but too nigh;
3625,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,I posted to forewarn you:
3626,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"The King hath sent Hobgoblin out,"
3627,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"To seek you all the fields about,"
3628,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And of your safety you may doubt,"
3629,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,If he but once discern you.”
3630,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3631,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"When, like an uproar in a town,"
3632,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Before them everything went down;
3633,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Some tore a ruff, and some a gown,"
3634,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,’Gainst one another justling;
3635,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,They flew about like chaff i’ th’ wind;
3636,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,For haste some left their masks behind;
3637,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Some could not stay their gloves to find;
3638,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,There never was such bustling.
3639,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3640,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Forth ran they, by a secret way,"
3641,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Into a brake that near them lay;
3642,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Yet much they doubted there to stay,"
3643,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Lest Hob should hap to find them;
3644,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"He had a sharp and piercing sight,"
3645,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,All one to him the day and night;
3646,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And therefore were resolved, by flight,"
3647,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,To leave this place behind them.
3648,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3649,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"At length one chanced to find a nut,"
3650,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"In th’ end of which a hole was cut,"
3651,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Which lay upon a hazel root,"
3652,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,There scattered by a squirrel
3653,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Which out the kernel gotten had;
3654,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"When quoth this Fay, “Dear Queen, be glad;"
3655,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Let Oberon be ne’er so mad,"
3656,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,I’ll set you safe from peril.
3657,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3658,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"“Come all into this nut,” quoth she,"
3659,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,“Come closely in; be ruled by me;
3660,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Each one may here a chooser be,"
3661,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,For room ye need not wrastle:
3662,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Nor need ye be together heaped;”
3663,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"So one by one therein they crept,"
3664,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And lying down they soundly slept,"
3665,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And safe as in a castle.
3666,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3667,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Nymphidia, that this while doth watch,"
3668,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Perceived if Puck the Queen should catch
3669,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"That he should be her over-match,"
3670,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Of which she well bethought her;
3671,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Found it must be some powerful charm,"
3672,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"The Queen against him that must arm,"
3673,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Or surely he would do her harm,"
3674,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,For throughly he had sought her.
3675,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3676,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And listening if she aught could hear,"
3677,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"That her might hinder, or might fear;"
3678,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,But finding still the coast was clear;
3679,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Nor creature had descried her;
3680,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Each circumstance and having scanned,"
3681,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"She came thereby to understand,"
3682,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Puck would be with them out of hand;
3683,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,When to her charms she hied her.
3684,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3685,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And first her fern-seed doth bestow,"
3686,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,The kernel of the mistletoe;
3687,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And here and there as Puck should go,"
3688,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"With terror to affright him,"
3689,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"She night-shade strews to work him ill,"
3690,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Therewith her vervain and her dill,"
3691,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"That hindreth witches of their will,"
3692,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Of purpose to despite him.
3693,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3694,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Then sprinkles she the juice of rue,"
3695,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,That groweth underneath the yew;
3696,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"With nine drops of the midnight dew,"
3697,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,From lunary distilling:
3698,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,The molewarp’s {108a} brain mixed therewithal;
3699,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And with the same the pismire’s gall:
3700,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"For she in nothing short would fall,"
3701,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,The Fairy was so willing.
3702,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3703,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Then thrice under a briar doth creep,"
3704,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Which at both ends was rooted deep,"
3705,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And over it three times she leap;
3706,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Her magic much availing:
3707,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Then on Prosérpina doth call,"
3708,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And so upon her spell doth fall,"
3709,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Which here to you repeat I shall,"
3710,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Not in one tittle failing.
3711,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3712,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,“By the croaking of a frog;
3713,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,By the howling of the dog;
3714,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,By the crying of the hog
3715,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Against the storm arising;
3716,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"By the evening curfew bell,"
3717,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"By the doleful dying knell,"
3718,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"O let this my direful spell,"
3719,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Hob, hinder thy surprising!"
3720,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3721,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,“By the mandrake’s {108b} dreadful groans;

3723,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,By the noise of dead men’s bones
3724,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,In charnel-houses rattling;
3725,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"By the hissing of the snake,"
3726,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"The rustling of the fire-drake, {108d}"
3727,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"I charge thee thou this place forsake,"
3728,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Nor of Queen Mab be prattling!
3729,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3730,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"“By the whirlwind’s hollow sound,"
3731,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"By the thunder’s dreadful stound,"
3732,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Yells of spirits underground,"
3733,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,I charge thee not to fear us;
3734,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"By the screech-owl’s dismal note,"
3735,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"By the black night-raven’s throat,"
3736,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"I charge thee, Hob, to tear thy coat"
3737,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"With thorns, if thou come near us!”"
3738,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3739,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Her spell thus spoke, she stept aside,"
3740,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And in a chink herself doth hide,"
3741,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"To see thereof what would betide,"
3742,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,For she doth only mind him:
3743,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"When presently she Puck espies,"
3744,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And well she marked his gloating eyes,"
3745,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"How under every leaf he pries,"
3746,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,In seeking still to find them.
3747,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3748,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"But once the circle got within,"
3749,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"The charms to work do straight begin,"
3750,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And he was caught as in a gin;
3751,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"For as he thus was busy,"
3752,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"A pain he in his head-piece feels,"
3753,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Against a stubbéd tree he reels,"
3754,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And up went poor Hobgoblin’s heels,"
3755,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Alas! his brain was dizzy!
3756,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3757,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"At length upon his feet he gets,"
3758,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Hobgoblin fumes, Hobgoblin frets;"
3759,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And as again he forward sets,"
3760,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And through the bushes scrambles,"
3761,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,A stump doth trip him in his pace;
3762,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Down comes poor Hob upon his face,"
3763,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And lamentably tore his case,"
3764,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Amongst the briars and brambles.
3765,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3766,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"“A plague upon Queen Mab!” quoth he,"
3767,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,“And all her maids where’er they be
3768,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"I think the devil guided me,"
3769,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,To seek her so provokéd!”
3770,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Where stumbling at a piece of wood,"
3771,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"He fell into a ditch of mud,"
3772,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Where to the very chin he stood,"
3773,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,In danger to be chokéd.

3775,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Now worse than e’er he was before,"

3777,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"That waked Queen Mab, who doubted sore"
3778,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Some treason had been wrought her:
3779,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Until Nymphidia told the Queen
3780,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"What she had done, what she had seen,"
3781,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Who then had well-near cracked her spleen
3782,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,With very extreme laughter.
3783,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3784,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"But leave we Hob to clamber out,"
3785,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Queen Mab and all her Fairy rout,"
3786,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And come again to have a bout
3787,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,With Oberon yet madding:
3788,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And with Pigwiggin now distraught,"
3789,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Who much was troubled in his thought,"
3790,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"That he so long the Queen had sought,"
3791,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And through the fields was gadding.
3792,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3793,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And as he runs he still doth cry,"
3794,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"“King Oberon, I thee defy,"
3795,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And dare thee here in arms to try,"
3796,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,For my dear lady’s honour:
3797,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"For that she is a Queen right good,"
3798,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"In whose defence I’ll shed my blood,"
3799,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And that thou in this jealous mood
3800,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Hast laid this slander on her.”
3801,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3802,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And quickly arms him for the field,"
3803,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"A little cockle-shell his shield,"
3804,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Which he could very bravely wield;
3805,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Yet could it not be piercéd:
3806,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"His spear a bent both stiff and strong,"
3807,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And well-near of two inches long:
3808,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"The pile was of a horse-fly’s tongue,"
3809,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Whose sharpness nought reverséd.
3810,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3811,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And puts him on a coat of mail,"
3812,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Which was made of a fish’s scale,"
3813,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"That when his foe should him assail,"
3814,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,No point should be prevailing:
3815,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"His rapier was a hornet’s sting,"
3816,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"It was a very dangerous thing,"
3817,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"For if he chanced to hurt the King,"
3818,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,It would be long in healing.
3819,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3820,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"His helmet was a beetle’s head,"
3821,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Most horrible and full of dread,"
3822,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"That able was to strike one dead,"
3823,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Yet did it well become him;
3824,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And for a plume a horse’s hair,"
3825,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Which, being tosséd with the air,"
3826,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Had force to strike his foe with fear,"
3827,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And turn his weapon from him.
3828,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3829,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Himself he on an earwig set,"
3830,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Yet scarce he on his back could get,"
3831,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"So oft and high he did curvet,"
3832,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Ere he himself could settle:
3833,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"He made him turn, and stop, and bound,"
3834,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"To gallop, and to trot the round,"
3835,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"He scarce could stand on any ground,"
3836,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,He was so full of mettle.
3837,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3838,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"When soon he met with Tomalin,"
3839,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"One that a valiant knight had been,"
3840,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And to King Oberon of kin;
3841,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Quoth he, “Thou manly Fairy,"
3842,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Tell Oberon I come prepared,"
3843,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Then bid him stand upon his guard;
3844,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"This hand his baseness shall reward,"
3845,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Let him be ne’er so wary.
3846,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3847,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"“Say to him thus, that I defy"
3848,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"His slanders and his infamy,"
3849,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And as a mortal enemy
3850,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Do publicly proclaim him:
3851,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Withal that if I had mine own,"
3852,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"He should not wear the Fairy crown,"
3853,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"But with a vengeance should come down,"
3854,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Nor we a king should name him.”
3855,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3856,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"This Tomalin could not abide,"
3857,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,To hear his sovereign vilified;
3858,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"But to the Fairy Court him hied,"
3859,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"(Full furiously he posted,)"
3860,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,With everything Pigwiggin said:
3861,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"How title to the crown he laid,"
3862,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And in what arms he was arrayed,"
3863,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,As how himself he boasted.
3864,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3865,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Twixt head and foot, from point to point,"
3866,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"He told the arming of each joint,"
3867,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"In every piece how neat and quoint,"
3868,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,For Tomalin could do it:
3869,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"How fair he sat, how sure he rid,"
3870,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"As of the courser he bestrid,"
3871,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"How managed, and how well he did:"
3872,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"The King which listened to it,"
3873,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3874,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Quoth he, “Go, Tomalin, with speed,"
3875,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Provide me arms, provide my steed,"
3876,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And everything that I shall need;
3877,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,By thee I will be guided:
3878,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,To straight account call thou thy wit;
3879,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"See there be wanting not a whit,"
3880,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"In everything see thou me fit,"
3881,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Just as my foe’s provided.”
3882,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3883,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Soon flew this news through Fairy-land,"
3884,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Which gave Queen Mab to understand
3885,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,The combat that was then in hand
3886,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Betwixt those men so mighty:
3887,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Which greatly she began to rue,"
3888,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Perceiving that all Fairy knew
3889,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,The first occasion from her grew
3890,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Of these affairs so weighty.
3891,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3892,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Wherefore attended with her maids,"
3893,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Through fogs, and mists, and damps she wades,"
3894,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"To Proserpine the Queen of Shades,"
3895,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"To treat, that it would please her"
3896,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"The cause into her hands to take,"
3897,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"For ancient love and friendship’s sake,"
3898,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And soon thereof an end to make,"
3899,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Which of much care would ease her.
3900,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3901,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"A while there let we Mab alone,"
3902,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And come we to King Oberon,"
3903,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Who, armed to meet his foe, is gone,"
3904,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,For proud Pigwiggin crying:
3905,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Who sought the Fairy King as fast,"
3906,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And had so well his journeys cast,"
3907,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"That he arrivéd at the last,"
3908,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,His puissant foe espying.
3909,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3910,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Stout Tomalin came with the King,"
3911,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Tom Thumb doth on Pigwiggin bring,"
3912,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,That perfect were in everything
3913,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,To single fights belonging:
3914,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And therefore they themselves engage,"
3915,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"To see them exercise their rage,"
3916,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"With fair and comely equipage,"
3917,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Not one the other wronging.
3918,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3919,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"So like in arms these champions were,"
3920,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"As they had been a very pair,"
3921,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"So that a man would almost swear,"
3922,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,That either had been either;
3923,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Their furious steeds began to neigh,"
3924,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,That they were heard a mighty way;
3925,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Their staves upon their rests they lay;
3926,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Yet ere they flew together
3927,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3928,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Their seconds minister an oath,"
3929,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Which was indifferent to them both,"
3930,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,That on their knightly faith and troth
3931,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,No magic them suppliéd;

3933,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Wherewith to work each other harms,"
3934,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,But came with simple open arms
3935,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,To have their causes triéd.
3936,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3937,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Together furiously they ran,"
3938,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,That to the ground came horse and man;
3939,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"The blood out of their helmets span,"
3940,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,So sharp were their encounters;
3941,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And though they to the earth were thrown,"
3942,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Yet quickly they regained their own,"
3943,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Such nimbleness was never shown,"
3944,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,They were two gallant mounters.
3945,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3946,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,When in a second course again
3947,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"They forward came with might and main,"
3948,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Yet which had better of the twain,"
3949,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,The seconds could not judge yet;
3950,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Their shields were into pieces cleft,"
3951,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Their helmets from their heads were reft,"
3952,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And to defend them nothing left,"
3953,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,These champions would not budge yet.
3954,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3955,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Away from them their staves they threw,"
3956,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Their cruel swords they quickly drew,"
3957,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And freshly they the fight renew,"
3958,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,They every stroke redoubled:
3959,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Which made Prosérpina take heed,"
3960,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And make to them the greater speed,"
3961,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"For fear lest they too much should bleed,"
3962,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Which wondrously her troubled.
3963,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3964,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"When to th’ infernal Styx she goes,"
3965,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"She takes the fogs from thence that rose,"
3966,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And {114} in a bag doth them enclose:
3967,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"When well she had them blended,"
3968,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"She hies her then to Lethe spring,"
3969,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"A bottle and thereof doth bring,"
3970,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Wherewith she meant to work the thing
3971,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Which only she intended.
3972,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3973,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Now Proserpine with Mab is gone,"
3974,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Unto the place where Oberon
3975,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And proud Pigwiggin, one to one,"
3976,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Both to be slain were likely:
3977,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And there themselves they closely hide,"
3978,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Because they would not be espied;
3979,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,For Proserpine meant to decide
3980,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,The matter very quickly.
3981,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3982,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And suddenly unties the poke,"
3983,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Which out of it sent such a smoke,"
3984,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"As ready was them all to choke,"
3985,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,So grievous was the pother;
3986,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"So that the knights each other lost,"
3987,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And stood as still as any post;
3988,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Tom Thumb nor Tomalin could boast
3989,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Themselves of any other.
3990,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
3991,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"But when the mist ’gan somewhat cease,"
3992,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Prosérpina commandeth peace;
3993,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And that a while they should release
3994,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Each other of their peril:
3995,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"“Which here,” quoth she, “I do proclaim"
3996,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"To all in dreadful Pluto’s name,"
3997,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"That as ye will eschew his blame,"
3998,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,You let me bear the quarrel:
3999,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
4000,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"“But here yourselves you must engage,"
4001,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Somewhat to cool your spleenish rage;
4002,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Your grievous thirst and to assuage
4003,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"That first you drink this liquor,"
4004,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Which shall your understanding clear,"
4005,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,As plainly shall to you appear;
4006,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Those things from me that you shall hear,"
4007,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Conceiving much the quicker.”
4008,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
4009,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"This Lethe water, you must know,"
4010,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"The memory destroyeth so,"
4011,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"That of our weal, or of our woe,"
4012,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Is all remembrance blotted;
4013,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Of it nor can you ever think,"
4014,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"For they no sooner took this drink,"
4015,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,But nought into their brains could sink
4016,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Of what had them besotted.
4017,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
4018,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"King Oberon forgotten had,"
4019,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"That he for jealousy ran mad,"
4020,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"But of his Queen was wondrous glad,"
4021,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And asked how they came thither:
4022,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,Pigwiggin likewise doth forget
4023,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,That he Queen Mab had ever met;
4024,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Or that they were so hard beset,"
4025,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,When they were found together.
4026,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
4027,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Nor neither of them both had thought,"
4028,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"That e’er they each had other sought,"
4029,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Much less that they a combat fought,"
4030,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,But such a dream were lothing.
4031,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Tom Thumb had got a little sup,"
4032,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And Tomalin scarce kissed the cup,"
4033,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Yet had their brains so sure locked up,"
4034,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,That they remembered nothing.
4035,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,
4036,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Queen Mab and her light maids, the while,"
4037,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Amongst themselves do closely smile,"
4038,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"To see the King caught with this wile,"
4039,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,With one another jesting:
4040,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"And to the Fairy Court they went,"
4041,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"With mickle joy and merriment,"
4042,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,"Which thing was done with good intent,"
4043,BY MICHAEL DRAYTON.,And thus I left them feasting.

4074,CANTO I.,Could make a gentle belle reject a lord?
4075,CANTO I.,"In tasks so bold, can little men engage,"

4077,CANTO I.,
4078,CANTO I.,"Sol through white curtains shot a timorous ray,"

4084,CANTO I.,"Belinda still her downy pillow pressed,"
4085,CANTO I.,Her guardian Sylph prolonged the balmy rest;
4086,CANTO I.,’Twas he had summoned to her silent bed
4087,CANTO I.,The morning-dream that hovered o’er her head;
4088,CANTO I.,"A youth more glittering than a birth-night beau,"
4089,CANTO I.,(That even in slumber caused her cheek to glow)

4164,CANTO I.,What tender maid but must a victim fall

4168,CANTO I.,"With varying vanities, from every part,"
4169,CANTO I.,They shift the moving toyshop of their heart;
4170,CANTO I.,"Where wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive,"
4171,CANTO I.,"Beaux banish beaux, and coaches coaches drive."
4172,CANTO I.,This erring mortal’s levity may call;

4175,CANTO I.,"“Of these am I, who thy protection claim,"

4186,CANTO I.,"He said; when Shock, who thought she slept too long,"

4193,CANTO I.,"And now, unveiled, the toilet stands displayed,"

4197,CANTO I.,"A heavenly image in the glass appears,"
4198,CANTO I.,"To that she bends, to that her eyes she rears;"
4199,CANTO I.,"The inferior priestess, at her altar’s side,"

4211,CANTO I.,Now awful beauty puts on all its arms;
4212,CANTO I.,"The fair each moment rises in her charms,"

4239,CANTO II.,"Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike,"

4264,CANTO II.,"For this, ere Phœbus rose, he had implored"

4283,CANTO II.,"All but the Sylph—with careful thoughts oppressed,"
4284,CANTO II.,Th’ impending woe sat heavy on his breast.
4285,CANTO II.,He summons straight his denizens of air;
4286,CANTO II.,The lucid squadrons round the sails repair:
4287,CANTO II.,"Soft o’er the shrouds aërial whispers breathe,"
4288,CANTO II.,That seemed but zephyrs to the train beneath.

4298,CANTO II.,Colours that change whene’er they wave their wings.
4299,CANTO II.,"Amid the circle, on the gilded mast,"
4300,CANTO II.,"Superior by the head, was Ariel placed;"

4318,CANTO II.,"Others on earth o’er human race preside,"
4319,CANTO II.,"Watch all their ways, and all their actions guide:"
4320,CANTO II.,"Of these the chief the care of nations own,"
4321,CANTO II.,And guard with arms divine the British throne.
4322,CANTO II.,
4323,CANTO II.,"“Our humbler province is to tend the fair,"
4324,CANTO II.,"Not a less pleasing, though less glorious care;"
4325,CANTO II.,"To save the powder from too rude a gale,"
4326,CANTO II.,Nor let the imprisoned essences exhale;
4327,CANTO II.,To draw fresh colours from the vernal flowers;
4328,CANTO II.,To steal from rainbows ere they drop in showers
4329,CANTO II.,"A brighter wash; to curl their waving hairs,"
4330,CANTO II.,"Assist their blushes, and inspire their airs;"
4331,CANTO II.,"Nay oft, in dreams, invention we bestow,"
4332,CANTO II.,To change a flounce or add a furbelow.
4333,CANTO II.,
4334,CANTO II.,“This day black omens threat the brightest fair
4335,CANTO II.,That e’er deserved a watchful spirit’s care;
4336,CANTO II.,"Some dire disaster, or by force or slight;"
4337,CANTO II.,"But what, or where, the fates have wrapt in night."
4338,CANTO II.,"Whether the nymph shall break Diana’s law,"
4339,CANTO II.,Or some frail china jar receive a flaw;
4340,CANTO II.,Or stain her honour or her new brocade;
4341,CANTO II.,"Forget her prayers, or miss a masquerade;"
4342,CANTO II.,"Or lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball;"
4343,CANTO II.,"Or whether Heaven has doomed that Shock must fall,"
4344,CANTO II.,"Haste, then, ye spirits! to your charge repair:"
4345,CANTO II.,The fluttering fan be Zephyretta’s care;
4346,CANTO II.,"The drops to thee, Brillante, we consign;"
4347,CANTO II.,"And, Momentilla, let the watch be thine;"
4348,CANTO II.,"Do thou, Crispissa, tend her favourite lock;"
4349,CANTO II.,Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock.
4350,CANTO II.,
4351,CANTO II.,"“To fifty chosen sylphs, of special note,"
4352,CANTO II.,"We trust th’ important charge, the petticoat:"
4353,CANTO II.,"Oft have we known that sevenfold fence to fail,"
4354,CANTO II.,"Though stiff with hoops, and armed with ribs of whale;"
4355,CANTO II.,"Form a strong line about the silver bound,"
4356,CANTO II.,And guard the wide circumference around.
4357,CANTO II.,
4358,CANTO II.,"“Whatever spirit, careless of his charge,"
4359,CANTO II.,"His post neglects, or leaves the fair at large,"
4360,CANTO II.,"Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o’ertake his sins,"
4361,CANTO II.,"Be stopped in vials, or transfixed with pins;"
4362,CANTO II.,"Or plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie,"
4363,CANTO II.,Or wedged whole ages in a bodkin’s eye:
4364,CANTO II.,"Gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain,"
4365,CANTO II.,While clogged he beats his silken wings in vain;
4366,CANTO II.,Or alum styptics with contracting power
4367,CANTO II.,Shrink his thin essence like a rivelled flower;
4368,CANTO II.,"Or, as Ixion fixed, the wretch shall feel"
4369,CANTO II.,"The giddy motion of the whirling mill,"
4370,CANTO II.,"In fumes of burning chocolate shall glow,"
4371,CANTO II.,And tremble at the sea that froths below!”
4372,CANTO II.,
4373,CANTO II.,He spoke; the spirits from the sails descend;
4374,CANTO II.,"Some, orb in orb, around the nymph extend;"
4375,CANTO II.,Some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair;
4376,CANTO II.,Some hang upon the pendants of her ear:
4377,CANTO II.,"With beating hearts the dire event they wait,"
4378,CANTO II.,"Anxious and trembling, for the birth of Fate."
4379,CANTO II.,
4380,CANTO II.,
4381,CANTO II.,
4382,CANTO III.,CANTO III.
4383,CANTO III.,
4384,CANTO III.,
4385,CANTO III.,"CLOSE by those meads, for ever crowned with flowers,"
4386,CANTO III.,"Where Thames with pride surveys his rising towers,"
4387,CANTO III.,"There stands a structure of majestic frame,"
4388,CANTO III.,Which from the neighbouring Hampton takes its name.
4389,CANTO III.,Here Britain’s statesmen oft the fall foredoom
4390,CANTO III.,Of foreign tyrants and of nymphs at home;
4391,CANTO III.,"Here thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey,"
4392,CANTO III.,Dost sometimes counsel take—and sometimes tea.
4393,CANTO III.,
4394,CANTO III.,"Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort,"
4395,CANTO III.,To taste awhile the pleasures of a court;
4396,CANTO III.,"In various talk the instructive hours they passed,"
4397,CANTO III.,"Who gave the ball, or paid the visit last;"
4398,CANTO III.,"One speaks the glory of the British Queen,"
4399,CANTO III.,And one describes a charming Indian screen;
4400,CANTO III.,"A third interprets motions, looks, and eyes;"
4401,CANTO III.,At every word a reputation dies.
4402,CANTO III.,"Snuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat,"
4403,CANTO III.,"With singing, laughing, ogling, _and all that_."
4404,CANTO III.,
4405,CANTO III.,"Meanwhile, declining from the noon of day,"
4406,CANTO III.,The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray;
4407,CANTO III.,"The hungry judges soon the sentence sign,"
4408,CANTO III.,And wretches hang that jurymen may dine;
4409,CANTO III.,"The merchant from the Exchange returns in peace,"
4410,CANTO III.,And the long labours of the toilet cease.
4411,CANTO III.,"Belinda now whom thirst of fame invites,"
4412,CANTO III.,"Burns to encounter two adventurous knights,"
4413,CANTO III.,At Ombre singly to decide their doom;
4414,CANTO III.,And swells her breast with conquests yet to come.
4415,CANTO III.,"Straight the three bands prepare in arms to join,"
4416,CANTO III.,Each band the number of the sacred nine.
4417,CANTO III.,"Soon as she spreads her hand, the aerial guard"
4418,CANTO III.,"Descend, and sit on each important card:"
4419,CANTO III.,"First Ariel, perched upon a Matador,"
4420,CANTO III.,"Then each, according to the rank they bore;"
4421,CANTO III.,"For sylphs, yet mindful of their ancient race,"
4422,CANTO III.,"Are, as when women, wondrous fond of place."
4423,CANTO III.,
4424,CANTO III.,"Behold, four Kings in majesty revered,"
4425,CANTO III.,With hoary whiskers and a forky beard;
4426,CANTO III.,"And four fair Queens whose hands sustain a flower,"
4427,CANTO III.,The expressive emblem of their softer power;
4428,CANTO III.,"Four Knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band,"
4429,CANTO III.,"Caps on their heads, and halberts in their hand;"
4430,CANTO III.,"And particoloured troops, a shining train,"
4431,CANTO III.,Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain.
4432,CANTO III.,
4433,CANTO III.,The skilful Nymph reviews her force with care:
4434,CANTO III.,"“Let Spades be trumps!” she said, and trumps they were."
4435,CANTO III.,
4436,CANTO III.,"Now move to war her sable Matadores,"
4437,CANTO III.,In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors.
4438,CANTO III.,"Spadillio first, unconquerable lord,"
4439,CANTO III.,"Led off two captive trumps, and swept the board."
4440,CANTO III.,"As many more Manillio forced to yield,"
4441,CANTO III.,And marched a victor from the verdant field.
4442,CANTO III.,"Him Basto followed, but his fate more hard"
4443,CANTO III.,Gained but one trump and one plebeian card.
4444,CANTO III.,"With his broad sabre next, a chief in years,"
4445,CANTO III.,"The hoary Majesty of Spades appears,"
4446,CANTO III.,"Puts forth one manly leg, to sight revealed,"
4447,CANTO III.,"The rest, his many-coloured robe concealed."
4448,CANTO III.,"The rebel Knave, who dares his prince engage,"
4449,CANTO III.,Proves the just victim of his royal rage.
4450,CANTO III.,"Even mighty Pam, {126} that Kings and Queens o’erthrew"
4451,CANTO III.,"And mowed down armies in the fights of Lu,"
4452,CANTO III.,"Sad chance of war! now destitute of aid,"
4453,CANTO III.,Falls undistinguished by the victor Spade!
4454,CANTO III.,
4455,CANTO III.,Thus far both armies to Belinda yield;
4456,CANTO III.,Now to the Baron fate inclines the field.
4457,CANTO III.,"His warlike Amazon her host invades,"
4458,CANTO III.,Th’ imperial consort of the crown of Spades.
4459,CANTO III.,"The Club’s black tyrant first her victim died,"
4460,CANTO III.,"Spite of his haughty mien, and barbarous pride;"
4461,CANTO III.,"What boots the regal circle on his head,"
4462,CANTO III.,"His giant limbs, in state unwieldy spread;"
4463,CANTO III.,"That long behind he trails his pompous robe,"
4464,CANTO III.,"And, of all monarchs, only grasps the globe?"
4465,CANTO III.,
4466,CANTO III.,The Baron now his Diamonds pours apace;
4467,CANTO III.,"The embroidered King who shows but half his face,"
4468,CANTO III.,"And his refulgent Queen, with powers combined"
4469,CANTO III.,Of broken troops an easy conquest find.
4470,CANTO III.,"Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, in wild disorder seen,"
4471,CANTO III.,With throngs promiscuous strow the level green.
4472,CANTO III.,"Thus when dispersed a routed army runs,"
4473,CANTO III.,"Of Asia’s troops, and Afric’s sable sons,"
4474,CANTO III.,"With like confusion different nations fly,"
4475,CANTO III.,"Of various habit, and of various dye,"
4476,CANTO III.,"The pierced battalions disunited fall,"
4477,CANTO III.,In heaps on heaps; one fate o’erwhelms them all.
4478,CANTO III.,
4479,CANTO III.,"The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts,"
4480,CANTO III.,And wins (oh shameful chance!) the Queen of Hearts.
4481,CANTO III.,"At this, the blood the virgin’s cheek forsook,"
4482,CANTO III.,A livid paleness spreads o’er all her look;
4483,CANTO III.,"She sees, and trembles at th’ approaching ill,"
4484,CANTO III.,"Just in the jaws of ruin, and codille."
4485,CANTO III.,And now (as oft in some distempered State)
4486,CANTO III.,On one nice trick depends the general fate.
4487,CANTO III.,An Ace of Hearts steps forth: the King unseen
4488,CANTO III.,"Lurked in her hand, and mourned his captive Queen:"
4489,CANTO III.,"He springs to vengeance with an eager pace,"
4490,CANTO III.,And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace.
4491,CANTO III.,The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky;
4492,CANTO III.,"The walls, the woods, and long canals reply."
4493,CANTO III.,
4494,CANTO III.,"Oh thoughtless mortals, ever blind to fate,"
4495,CANTO III.,"Too soon dejected, and too soon elate!"
4496,CANTO III.,"Sudden, these honours shall be snatched away,"
4497,CANTO III.,And cursed for ever this victorious day.
4498,CANTO III.,
4499,CANTO III.,"For lo, the board with cups and spoons is crowned,"
4500,CANTO III.,"The berries crackle, and the mill turns round;"
4501,CANTO III.,On shining altars of Japan they raise
4502,CANTO III.,The silver lamp; the fiery spirits blaze:
4503,CANTO III.,"From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide,"
4504,CANTO III.,While China’s earth receives the smoking tide:
4505,CANTO III.,"At once they gratify their scent and taste,"
4506,CANTO III.,And frequent cups prolong the rich repast.
4507,CANTO III.,Straight hover round the Fair her airy band;
4508,CANTO III.,"Some, as she sipped, the fuming liquor fanned,"
4509,CANTO III.,"Some o’er her lap their careful plumes displayed,"
4510,CANTO III.,"Trembling, and conscious of the rich brocade."
4511,CANTO III.,"Coffee (which makes the politician wise,"
4512,CANTO III.,And see through all things with his half-shut eyes)
4513,CANTO III.,Sent up in vapours to the Baron’s brain
4514,CANTO III.,New stratagems the radiant Lock to gain.
4515,CANTO III.,"Ah cease, rash youth! desist ere ’tis too late,"
4516,CANTO III.,"Fear the just Gods, and think of Scylla’s fate!"
4517,CANTO III.,"Changed to a bird, and sent to flit in air,"
4518,CANTO III.,She dearly pays for Nisus’ injured hair!
4519,CANTO III.,
4520,CANTO III.,"But when to mischief mortals bend their will,"
4521,CANTO III.,How soon they find fit instruments of ill!
4522,CANTO III.,"Just then, Clarissa drew with tempting grace"
4523,CANTO III.,A two-edged weapon from her shining case:
4524,CANTO III.,"So ladies in romance assist their knight,"
4525,CANTO III.,"Present the spear, and arm him for the fight."
4526,CANTO III.,"He takes the gift with reverence, and extends"
4527,CANTO III.,The little engine on his fingers’ ends;
4528,CANTO III.,"This just behind Belinda’s neck he spread,"
4529,CANTO III.,As o’er the fragrant steams she bends her head.
4530,CANTO III.,"Swift to the lock a thousand sprites repair,"
4531,CANTO III.,"A thousand wings, by turns, blow back the hair;"
4532,CANTO III.,And thrice they twitched the diamond in her ear;
4533,CANTO III.,"Thrice she looked back, and thrice the foe drew near."
4534,CANTO III.,"Just in that instant, anxious Ariel sought"
4535,CANTO III.,The close recesses of the virgin’s thought;
4536,CANTO III.,"As on the nosegay in her breast reclined,"
4537,CANTO III.,"He watched the ideas rising in her mind,"
4538,CANTO III.,"Sudden he viewed, in spite of all her art,"
4539,CANTO III.,An earthly lover lurking at her heart.
4540,CANTO III.,"Amazed, confused, he found his power expired,"
4541,CANTO III.,"Resigned to fate, and with a sigh retired."
4542,CANTO III.,
4543,CANTO III.,"The peer now spreads the glittering forfex wide,"
4544,CANTO III.,"To inclose the lock; now joins it, to divide."
4545,CANTO III.,"Even then, before the fatal engine closed,"
4546,CANTO III.,A wretched sylph too fondly interposed;
4547,CANTO III.,"Fate urged the shears, and cut the sylph in twain"
4548,CANTO III.,"(But airy substance soon unites again),"
4549,CANTO III.,The meeting points the sacred hair dissever
4550,CANTO III.,"From the fair head, for ever, and for ever!"
4551,CANTO III.,
4552,CANTO III.,"Then flashed the living lightning from her eyes,"
4553,CANTO III.,And screams of horror rend the affrighted skies.
4554,CANTO III.,"Not louder shrieks to pitying heaven are cast,"
4555,CANTO III.,When husbands or when lapdogs breathe their last;
4556,CANTO III.,"Or when rich china vessels fallen from high,"
4557,CANTO III.,In glittering dust and painted fragments lie!
4558,CANTO III.,
4559,CANTO III.,"“Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine,”"
4560,CANTO III.,"The victor cried, “the glorious prize is mine!”"
4561,CANTO III.,"While fish in streams, or birds delight in air,"
4562,CANTO III.,"Or in a coach-and-six the British fair,"
4563,CANTO III.,"As long as Atalantis shall be read, {129}"
4564,CANTO III.,"Or the small pillow grace a lady’s bed,"
4565,CANTO III.,"While visits shall be paid on solemn days,"
4566,CANTO III.,"When numerous wax-lights in bright order blaze,"
4567,CANTO III.,"While nymphs take treats, or assignations give,"
4568,CANTO III.,"So long my honour, name, and praise shall live!"
4569,CANTO III.,"What time would spare, from steel receives its date,"
4570,CANTO III.,"And monuments, like men, submit to fate!"
4571,CANTO III.,"Steel could the labour of the gods destroy,"
4572,CANTO III.,And strike to dust th’ imperial towers of Troy;
4573,CANTO III.,"Steel could the works of mortal pride confound,"
4574,CANTO III.,And hew triumphal arches to the ground.
4575,CANTO III.,"What wonder then, fair nymph! thy hairs should feel"
4576,CANTO III.,The conquering force of unresisting steel?
4577,CANTO III.,
4578,CANTO III.,
4579,CANTO III.,
4580,CANTO IV.,CANTO IV.
4581,CANTO IV.,
4582,CANTO IV.,
4583,CANTO IV.,"BUT anxious cares the pensive nymph oppressed,"
4584,CANTO IV.,And secret passions laboured in her breast.
4585,CANTO IV.,"Not youthful kings in battle seized alive,"
4586,CANTO IV.,"Not scornful virgins who their charms survive,"
4587,CANTO IV.,"Not ardent lovers robbed of all their bliss,"
4588,CANTO IV.,"Not ancient ladies when refused a kiss,"
4589,CANTO IV.,"Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die,"
4590,CANTO IV.,"Not Cynthia when her manteau’s pinned awry,"
4591,CANTO IV.,"E’er felt such rage, resentment, and despair,"
4592,CANTO IV.,"As thou, sad virgin! for thy ravished hair."
4593,CANTO IV.,
4594,CANTO IV.,For that sad moment when the sylphs withdrew.
4595,CANTO IV.,"And Ariel weeping from Belinda flew,"
4596,CANTO IV.,"Umbriel, a dusky, melancholy sprite,"
4597,CANTO IV.,"As ever sullied the fair face of light,"
4598,CANTO IV.,"Down to the central earth, his proper scene,"
4599,CANTO IV.,Repaired to search the gloomy cave of Spleen.
4600,CANTO IV.,
4601,CANTO IV.,"Swift on his sooty pinions flits the gnome,"
4602,CANTO IV.,And in a vapour reached the dismal dome.
4603,CANTO IV.,"No cheerful breeze this sullen region knows,"
4604,CANTO IV.,The dreaded east is all the wind that blows.
4605,CANTO IV.,"Here in a grotto, sheltered close from air,"
4606,CANTO IV.,"And screened in shades from day’s detested glare,"
4607,CANTO IV.,"She sighs for ever on her pensive bed,"
4608,CANTO IV.,"Pain at her side, and Megrim {130} at her head."
4609,CANTO IV.,
4610,CANTO IV.,"Two handmaids wait the throne: alike in place,"
4611,CANTO IV.,But differing far in figure and in face.
4612,CANTO IV.,"Here stood Ill-nature like an ancient maid,"
4613,CANTO IV.,Her wrinkled form in black and white arrayed;
4614,CANTO IV.,"With store of prayers, for mornings, nights, and noons,"
4615,CANTO IV.,Her hand is filled; her bosom with lampoons.
4616,CANTO IV.,
4617,CANTO IV.,"There Affectation, with a sickly mien,"
4618,CANTO IV.,"Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen,"
4619,CANTO IV.,"Practised to lisp, and hang the head aside,"
4620,CANTO IV.,"Faints into airs, and languishes with pride,"
4621,CANTO IV.,"On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe,"
4622,CANTO IV.,"Wrapped in a gown, for sickness, and for show."
4623,CANTO IV.,"The fair ones feel such maladies as these,"
4624,CANTO IV.,When each new night-dress gives a new disease.
4625,CANTO IV.,A constant vapour o’er the palace flies;
4626,CANTO IV.,Strange phantoms rising as the mists arise;
4627,CANTO IV.,"Dreadful as hermit’s dreams in haunted shades,"
4628,CANTO IV.,Or bright as visions of expiring maids.
4629,CANTO IV.,"Now glaring fiends, and snakes on rolling spires,"
4630,CANTO IV.,"Pale spectres, gaping tombs, and purple fires:"
4631,CANTO IV.,"Now lakes of liquid gold, Elysian scenes,"
4632,CANTO IV.,And crystal domes and angels in machines.
4633,CANTO IV.,
4634,CANTO IV.,"Unnumbered throngs on every side are seen,"
4635,CANTO IV.,Of bodies changed to various forms by Spleen.
4636,CANTO IV.,"Here living tea-pots stand, one arm held out,"
4637,CANTO IV.,"One bent; the handle this, and that the spout:"
4638,CANTO IV.,"A pipkin there, like Homer’s tripod walks;"
4639,CANTO IV.,"Here sighs a jar, and there a goose-pie talks;"
4640,CANTO IV.,"Men prove with child, as powerful fancy works,"
4641,CANTO IV.,And maids turned bottles call aloud for corks.
4642,CANTO IV.,
4643,CANTO IV.,"Safe past the Gnome, through this fantastic band,"
4644,CANTO IV.,A branch of healing spleenwort in his hand.
4645,CANTO IV.,"Then thus addressed the power: “Hail, wayward Queen!"
4646,CANTO IV.,Who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen:
4647,CANTO IV.,"Parent of vapours and of female wit,"
4648,CANTO IV.,"Who give the hysteric, or poetic fit,"
4649,CANTO IV.,"On various tempers act by various ways,"
4650,CANTO IV.,"Make some take physic, others scribble plays;"
4651,CANTO IV.,"Who cause the proud their visits to delay,"
4652,CANTO IV.,And send the godly in a pet to pray.
4653,CANTO IV.,"A nymph there is, that all thy power disdains,"
4654,CANTO IV.,And thousands more in equal mirth maintains.
4655,CANTO IV.,"But oh! if e’er thy gnome could spoil a grace,"
4656,CANTO IV.,"Or raise a pimple on a beauteous face,"
4657,CANTO IV.,"Like citron-waters matrons’ cheeks inflame,"
4658,CANTO IV.,Or change complexions at a losing game;
4659,CANTO IV.,"If e’er with airy horns I planted heads,"
4660,CANTO IV.,"Or rumpled petticoats, or tumbled beds,"
4661,CANTO IV.,"Or caused suspicion when no soul was rude,"
4662,CANTO IV.,"Or discomposed the head-dress of a prude,"
4663,CANTO IV.,"Or e’er to costive lapdog gave disease,"
4664,CANTO IV.,Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease:
4665,CANTO IV.,"Hear me, and touch Belinda with chagrin,"
4666,CANTO IV.,That single act gives half the world the spleen.”
4667,CANTO IV.,
4668,CANTO IV.,The Goddess with a discontented air
4669,CANTO IV.,"Seems to reject him, though she grants his prayer."
4670,CANTO IV.,"A wondrous bag with both her hands she binds,"
4671,CANTO IV.,Like that where once Ulysses held the winds;
4672,CANTO IV.,"There she collects the force of female lungs,"
4673,CANTO IV.,"Sighs, sobs, and passions, and the war of tongues."
4674,CANTO IV.,"A vial next she fills with fainting fears,"
4675,CANTO IV.,"Soft sorrows, melting griefs, and flowing tears."
4676,CANTO IV.,"The gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away,"
4677,CANTO IV.,"Spreads his black wings, and slowly mounts to day."
4678,CANTO IV.,
4679,CANTO IV.,"Sunk in Thalestris’ arms the nymph he found,"
4680,CANTO IV.,Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound.
4681,CANTO IV.,"Full o’er their heads the swelling bag he rent,"
4682,CANTO IV.,And all the Furies issued at the vent.
4683,CANTO IV.,"Belinda burns with more than mortal ire,"
4684,CANTO IV.,And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire.
4685,CANTO IV.,"“O wretched maid!” she spread her hands, and cried,"
4686,CANTO IV.,"(While Hampton’s echoes, “Wretched maid!” replied)"
4687,CANTO IV.,“Was it for this you took such constant care
4688,CANTO IV.,"The bodkin, comb, and essence to prepare?"
4689,CANTO IV.,"For this your locks in paper durance bound,"
4690,CANTO IV.,For this with torturing irons wreathed around?
4691,CANTO IV.,"For this with fillets strained your tender head,"
4692,CANTO IV.,And bravely bore the double loads of lead?
4693,CANTO IV.,"Gods! shall the ravisher display your hair,"
4694,CANTO IV.,"While the fops envy, and the ladies stare!"
4695,CANTO IV.,Honour forbid! at whose unrivalled shrine
4696,CANTO IV.,"Ease, pleasure, virtue, all our sex resign."
4697,CANTO IV.,"Methinks already I your tears survey,"
4698,CANTO IV.,"Already hear the horrid things they say,"
4699,CANTO IV.,"Already see you a degraded toast,"
4700,CANTO IV.,And all your honour in a whisper lost!
4701,CANTO IV.,"How shall I, then, your helpless fame defend?"
4702,CANTO IV.,’Twill then be infamy to seem your friend!
4703,CANTO IV.,"And shall this prize, the inestimable prize,"
4704,CANTO IV.,"Exposed through crystal to the gazing eyes,"
4705,CANTO IV.,"And heightened by the diamond’s circling rays,"
4706,CANTO IV.,On that rapacious hand for ever blaze?
4707,CANTO IV.,"Sooner shall grass in Hyde Park Circus grow,"
4708,CANTO IV.,And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow;
4709,CANTO IV.,"Sooner let earth, air, sea, to chaos fall,"
4710,CANTO IV.,"Men, monkeys, lap-dogs, parrots, perish all!”"
4711,CANTO IV.,
4712,CANTO IV.,"She said; then raging to Sir Plume repairs,"
4713,CANTO IV.,And bids her beau demand the precious hairs:
4714,CANTO IV.,"(Sir Plume of amber snuff-box justly vain,"
4715,CANTO IV.,And the nice conduct of a clouded cane)
4716,CANTO IV.,"With earnest eyes, and round unthinking face,"
4717,CANTO IV.,"He first the snuff-box opened, then the case,"
4718,CANTO IV.,"And thus broke out—“My Lord, why what the devil?"
4719,CANTO IV.,"Zounds! damn the lock! ’fore Gad, you must be civil!"
4720,CANTO IV.,"Plague on’t! ’tis past a jest—nay prithee, pox!"
4721,CANTO IV.,"Give her the hair”—he spoke, and rapped his box."
4722,CANTO IV.,
4723,CANTO IV.,“It grieves me much” (replied the Peer again)
4724,CANTO IV.,“Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain.
4725,CANTO IV.,"But by this lock, this sacred lock, I swear,"
4726,CANTO IV.,(Which never more shall join its parted hair;
4727,CANTO IV.,"Which never more its honours shall renew,"
4728,CANTO IV.,Clipped from the lovely head where late it grew)
4729,CANTO IV.,"That while my nostrils draw the vital air,"
4730,CANTO IV.,"This hand, which won it, shall for ever wear.”"
4731,CANTO IV.,"He spoke, and speaking, in proud triumph spread"
4732,CANTO IV.,The long-contended honours of her head.
4733,CANTO IV.,
4734,CANTO IV.,"But Umbriel, hateful gnome! forbears not so;"
4735,CANTO IV.,He breaks the vial whence the sorrows flow.
4736,CANTO IV.,"Then see! the nymph in beauteous grief appears,"
4737,CANTO IV.,"Her eyes half-languishing, half-drowned in tears;"
4738,CANTO IV.,"On her heaved bosom hung her drooping head,"
4739,CANTO IV.,"Which, with a sigh, she raised; and thus she said:"
4740,CANTO IV.,
4741,CANTO IV.,"“For ever cursed be this detested day,"
4742,CANTO IV.,"Which snatched my best, my favourite curl away!"
4743,CANTO IV.,"Happy! ah, ten times happy had I been,"
4744,CANTO IV.,If Hampton Court these eyes had never seen!
4745,CANTO IV.,"Yet am not I the first mistaken maid,"
4746,CANTO IV.,By love of courts to numerous ills betrayed.
4747,CANTO IV.,Oh had I rather unadmired remained
4748,CANTO IV.,"In some lone isle, or distant Northern land,"
4749,CANTO IV.,"Where the gilt chariot never marks the way,"
4750,CANTO IV.,"Where none learn ombre, none e’er taste Bohea;"
4751,CANTO IV.,"There kept my charms concealed from mortal eye,"
4752,CANTO IV.,Like roses that in deserts bloom and die!
4753,CANTO IV.,What moved my mind with youthful lords to roam?
4754,CANTO IV.,"Oh had I stayed, and said my prayers at home!"
4755,CANTO IV.,"’Twas this, the morning omens seemed to tell,"
4756,CANTO IV.,Thrice from my trembling hand the patch-box fell;
4757,CANTO IV.,"The tottering china shook without a wind,"
4758,CANTO IV.,"Nay, Poll sat mute, and Shock was most unkind!"
4759,CANTO IV.,"A sylph, too, warned me of the threats of fate,"
4760,CANTO IV.,"In mystic visions, now believed too late!"
4761,CANTO IV.,See the poor remnants of these slighted hairs!
4762,CANTO IV.,My hands shall rend what even thy rapine spares:
4763,CANTO IV.,"These in two sable ringlets taught to break,"
4764,CANTO IV.,Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck;
4765,CANTO IV.,"The sister-lock now sits uncouth, alone,"
4766,CANTO IV.,And in its fellow’s fate foresees its own;
4767,CANTO IV.,"Uncurled it hangs, the fatal shears demands,"
4768,CANTO IV.,And tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands.
4769,CANTO IV.,"Oh hadst thou, cruel! been content to seize"
4770,CANTO IV.,"Hairs less in sight, or any hairs but these!”"
4771,CANTO IV.,
4772,CANTO IV.,
4773,CANTO IV.,
4774,CANTO V.,CANTO V.
4775,CANTO V.,
4776,CANTO V.,
4777,CANTO V.,SHE said: the pitying audience melt in tears.
4778,CANTO V.,But Fate and Jove had stopped the Baron’s ears.
4779,CANTO V.,"In vain Thalestris with reproach assails,"
4780,CANTO V.,For who can move when fair Belinda fails?
4781,CANTO V.,"Not half so fixed the Trojan could remain,"
4782,CANTO V.,While Anna begged and Dido raged in vain.
4783,CANTO V.,Then grave Clarissa graceful waved her fan;
4784,CANTO V.,"Silence ensued, and thus the nymph began:"
4785,CANTO V.,
4786,CANTO V.,"“Say why are beauties praised and honoured most,"
4787,CANTO V.,"The wise man’s passion, and the vain man’s toast?"
4788,CANTO V.,"Why decked with all that land and sea afford,"
4789,CANTO V.,"Why angels called, and angel-like adored?"
4790,CANTO V.,"Why round our coaches crowd the white-gloved beaux,"
4791,CANTO V.,Why bows the side-box from its inmost rows;
4792,CANTO V.,"How vain are all these glories, all our pains,"
4793,CANTO V.,Unless good sense preserve what beauty gains:
4794,CANTO V.,"That men may say, when we the front-box grace:"
4795,CANTO V.,‘Behold the first in virtue as in face!’
4796,CANTO V.,"Oh! if to dance all night, and dress all day,"
4797,CANTO V.,"Charmed the smallpox, or chased old age away,"
4798,CANTO V.,"Who would not scorn what housewife’s cares produce,"
4799,CANTO V.,Or who would learn one earthly thing of use?
4800,CANTO V.,"To patch, nay ogle, might become a saint,"
4801,CANTO V.,Nor could it sure be such a sin to paint.
4802,CANTO V.,"But since, alas! frail beauty must decay;"
4803,CANTO V.,"Curled or uncurled, since locks will turn to grey;"
4804,CANTO V.,"Since painted, or not painted, all shall fade,"
4805,CANTO V.,"And she who scorns a man, must die a maid;"
4806,CANTO V.,"What then remains but well our power to use,"
4807,CANTO V.,And keep good-humour still whate’er we lose?
4808,CANTO V.,"And trust me, dear! good-humour can prevail,"
4809,CANTO V.,"When airs, and flights, and screams, and scolding fail."
4810,CANTO V.,Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll;
4811,CANTO V.,"Charms strike the sight, but merit wins the soul.”"
4812,CANTO V.,
4813,CANTO V.,"So spoke the dame, but no applause ensued;"
4814,CANTO V.,"Belinda frowned, Thalestris called her Prude."
4815,CANTO V.,"“To arms, to arms!” the fierce virago cries,"
4816,CANTO V.,And swift as lightning to the combat flies.
4817,CANTO V.,"All side in parties, and begin the attack;"
4818,CANTO V.,"Fans clap, silks rustle, and tough whalebones crack;"
4819,CANTO V.,"Heroes’ and heroines’ shouts confusedly rise,"
4820,CANTO V.,And bass and treble voices strike the skies.
4821,CANTO V.,"No common weapons in their hands are found,"
4822,CANTO V.,"Like gods they fight, nor dread a mortal wound."
4823,CANTO V.,
4824,CANTO V.,"So when bold Homer makes the gods engage,"
4825,CANTO V.,And heavenly breasts with human passions rage;
4826,CANTO V.,"’Gainst Pallas, Mars; Latona, Hermes arms;"
4827,CANTO V.,And all Olympus rings with loud alarms:
4828,CANTO V.,"Jove’s thunder roars, heaven trembles all around,"
4829,CANTO V.,"Blue Neptune storms, the bellowing deeps resound,"
4830,CANTO V.,"Earth shakes her nodding towers, the ground gives way,"
4831,CANTO V.,And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day!
4832,CANTO V.,
4833,CANTO V.,Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce’s height
4834,CANTO V.,"Clapped his glad wings, and sate to view the fight;"
4835,CANTO V.,"Propped on their bodkin spears, the sprites survey"
4836,CANTO V.,"The growing combat, or assist the fray."
4837,CANTO V.,
4838,CANTO V.,"While through the press enraged Thalestris flies,"
4839,CANTO V.,"And scatters death around from both her eyes,"
4840,CANTO V.,"A beau and witling perished in the throng,"
4841,CANTO V.,"One died in metaphor, and one in song."
4842,CANTO V.,
4843,CANTO V.,"“O cruel nymph! a living death I bear,”"
4844,CANTO V.,"Cried Dapperwit, and sunk beside his chair."
4845,CANTO V.,"A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast,"
4846,CANTO V.,“Those eyes are made so killing”—was his last.
4847,CANTO V.,Thus on Mæander’s flowery margin lies
4848,CANTO V.,"The expiring swan, and as he sings he dies."
4849,CANTO V.,
4850,CANTO V.,"When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down,"
4851,CANTO V.,"Chloe stepped in, and killed him with a frown;"
4852,CANTO V.,"She smiled to see the doughty hero slain,"
4853,CANTO V.,"But, at her smile, the beau revived again."
4854,CANTO V.,
4855,CANTO V.,"Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air,"
4856,CANTO V.,Weighs the men’s wits against the ladies’ hair;
4857,CANTO V.,The doubtful beam long nods from side to side;
4858,CANTO V.,"At length the wits mount up, the hairs subside."
4859,CANTO V.,
4860,CANTO V.,"See, fierce Belinda on the Baron flies,"
4861,CANTO V.,With more than usual lightning in her eyes:
4862,CANTO V.,"Nor feared the chief the unequal fight to try,"
4863,CANTO V.,Who sought no more than on his foe to die.
4864,CANTO V.,"But this bold lord with manly strength endued,"
4865,CANTO V.,She with one finger and a thumb subdued:
4866,CANTO V.,"Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew,"
4867,CANTO V.,A charge of snuff the wily virgin threw;
4868,CANTO V.,"The gnomes direct, to every atom just,"
4869,CANTO V.,The pungent grains of titillating dust.
4870,CANTO V.,"Sudden, with starting tears each eye o’erflows,"
4871,CANTO V.,And the high dome re-echoes to his nose.
4872,CANTO V.,
4873,CANTO V.,"“Now meet thy fate,” incensed Belinda cried,"
4874,CANTO V.,And drew a deadly bodkin from her side.
4875,CANTO V.,"(The same, his ancient personage to deck,"
4876,CANTO V.,"Her great-great-grandsire wore about his neck,"
4877,CANTO V.,"In three seal-rings; which after, melted down,"
4878,CANTO V.,Formed a vast buckle for his widow’s gown;
4879,CANTO V.,"Her infant grandame’s whistle next it grew,"
4880,CANTO V.,"The bells she jingled, and the whistle blew;"
4881,CANTO V.,"Then in a bodkin graced her mother’s hairs,"
4882,CANTO V.,"Which long she wore, and now Belinda wears)."
4883,CANTO V.,
4884,CANTO V.,"“Boast not my fall,” he cried, “insulting foe!"
4885,CANTO V.,"Thou by some other shalt be laid as low,"
4886,CANTO V.,Nor think to die dejects my lofty mind:
4887,CANTO V.,All that I dread is leaving you behind!
4888,CANTO V.,"Rather than so, ah! let me still survive,"
4889,CANTO V.,And burn in Cupid’s flames—but burn alive.”
4890,CANTO V.,
4891,CANTO V.,“Restore the lock!” she cries; and all around
4892,CANTO V.,“Restore the lock!” the vaulted roofs rebound.
4893,CANTO V.,Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain
4894,CANTO V.,Roared for the handkerchief that caused his pain.
4895,CANTO V.,"But see how oft ambitious aims are crossed,"
4896,CANTO V.,And chiefs contend till all the prize is lost!
4897,CANTO V.,"The lock, obtained with guilt, and kept with pain,"
4898,CANTO V.,"In every place is sought, but sought in vain:"
4899,CANTO V.,"With such a prize no mortal must be blest,"
4900,CANTO V.,So Heaven decrees: with Heaven who can contest?
4901,CANTO V.,
4902,CANTO V.,"Some thought it mounted to the lunar sphere,"
4903,CANTO V.,"Since all things lost on earth are treasured there,"
4904,CANTO V.,"There heroes’ wits are kept in ponderous vases,"
4905,CANTO V.,And beaux’ in snuff-boxes and tweezer-cases.
4906,CANTO V.,"There broken vows and death-bed alms are found,"
4907,CANTO V.,"And lovers’ hearts with ends of riband bound,"
4908,CANTO V.,"The courtiers promises, and sick man’s prayers,"
4909,CANTO V.,"The smiles of harlots, and the tears of heirs,"
4910,CANTO V.,"Cages for gnats, and chains to yoke a flea,"
4911,CANTO V.,Dried butterflies and tomes of casuistry.
4912,CANTO V.,
4913,CANTO V.,"But trust the Muse—she saw it upward rise,"
4914,CANTO V.,"Though marked by none but quick, poetic eyes:"
4915,CANTO V.,"(So Rome’s great founder to the heavens withdrew,"
4916,CANTO V.,To Proculus alone confessed in view)
4917,CANTO V.,"A sudden star, it shot through liquid air,"
4918,CANTO V.,And drew behind a radiant trail of hair.
4919,CANTO V.,"Not Berenice’s locks first rose so bright,"
4920,CANTO V.,The heavens bespangling with dishevelled light.
4921,CANTO V.,"The sylphs behold it kindling as it flies,"
4922,CANTO V.,And pleased pursue its progress through the skies.
4923,CANTO V.,
4924,CANTO V.,"This the beau-monde shall from the Mall survey,"
4925,CANTO V.,And hail with music its propitious ray.
4926,CANTO V.,"This the blest lover shall for Venus take,"
4927,CANTO V.,And send up vows from Rosamonda’s lake.
4928,CANTO V.,"This Partridge {137} soon shall view in cloudless skies,"
4929,CANTO V.,When next he looks through Galileo’s eyes;
4930,CANTO V.,And hence the egregious wizard shall foredoom
4931,CANTO V.,"The fate of Louis, and the fall of Rome."
4932,CANTO V.,
4933,CANTO V.,"Then cease, bright nymph! to mourn thy ravished hair,"
4934,CANTO V.,Which adds new glory to the shining sphere!
4935,CANTO V.,"Not all the tresses that fair head can boast,"
4936,CANTO V.,Shall draw such envy as the lock you lost.
4937,CANTO V.,"For, after all the murders of your eye,"
4938,CANTO V.,"When, after millions slain, yourself shall die:"
4939,CANTO V.,"When those fair suns shall set, as set they must,"
4940,CANTO V.,"And all those tresses shall be laid in dust,"
4941,CANTO V.,"This lock the Muse shall consecrate to fame,"
4942,CANTO V.,And ’midst the stars inscribe Belinda’s name.

4955,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
4956,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,JOHN GILPIN was a citizen
4957,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Of credit and renown,"
4958,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,A train-band captain eke was he
4959,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Of famous London town.
4960,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
4961,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"John Gilpin’s spouse said to her dear,"
4962,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,“Though wedded we have been
4963,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"These twice ten tedious years, yet we"
4964,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,No holiday have seen.
4965,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
4966,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"“To-morrow is our wedding-day,"
4967,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,And we will then repair
4968,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Unto the Bell at Edmonton,"
4969,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,All in a chaise and pair.
4970,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
4971,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"“My sister, and my sister’s child,"
4972,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Myself, and children three,"
4973,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Will fill the chaise; so you must ride
4974,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,On horseback after we.”
4975,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
4976,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"He soon replied, “I do admire"
4977,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Of womankind but one,"
4978,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And you are she, my dearest dear,"
4979,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Therefore it shall be done.
4980,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
4981,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"“I am a linen-draper bold,"
4982,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"As all the world doth know,"
4983,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,And my good friend the calender
4984,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Will lend his horse to go.”
4985,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
4986,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, “That’s well said:"
4987,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And for that wine is dear,"
4988,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"We will be furnished with our own,"
4989,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Which is both bright and clear.”
4990,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
4991,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,John Gilpin kissed his loving wife;
4992,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"O’erjoyed was he to find,"
4993,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"That though on pleasure she was bent,"
4994,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,She had a frugal mind.
4995,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
4996,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"The morning came, the chaise was brought,"
4997,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,But yet was not allowed
4998,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"To drive up to the door, lest all"
4999,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Should say that she was proud.
5000,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5001,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"So three doors off the chaise was stayed,"
5002,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Where they did all get in;
5003,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Six precious souls, and all agog"
5004,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,To dash through thick and thin.
5005,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5006,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,"
5007,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Were never folk so glad,"
5008,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"The stones did rattle underneath,"
5009,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,As if Cheapside were mad.
5010,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5011,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,John Gilpin at his horse’s side
5012,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Seized fast the flowing mane,"
5013,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And up he got, in haste to ride,"
5014,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,But soon came down again;
5015,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5016,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"For saddle-tree scarce reached had he,"
5017,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"His journey to begin,"
5018,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"When, turning round his head, he saw"
5019,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Three customers come in.
5020,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5021,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"So down he came; for loss of time,"
5022,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Although it grieved him sore,"
5023,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,"
5024,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Would trouble him much more.
5025,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5026,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,’Twas long before the customers
5027,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Were suited to their mind,"
5028,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"When Betty screaming came downstairs,"
5029,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,“The wine is left behind!”
5030,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5031,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"“Good lack!” quoth he—“yet bring it me,"
5032,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"My leathern belt likewise,"
5033,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"In which I bear my trusty sword,"
5034,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,When I do exercise.”
5035,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5036,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)
5037,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Had two stone bottles found,"
5038,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"To hold the liquor that she loved,"
5039,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,And keep it safe and sound.
5040,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5041,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Each bottle had a curling ear,"
5042,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Through which the belt he drew,"
5043,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And hung a bottle on each side,"
5044,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,To make his balance true.
5045,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5046,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Then over all, that he might be"
5047,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Equipped from top to toe,"
5048,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"His long red cloak, well brushed and neat,"
5049,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,He manfully did throw.
5050,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5051,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Now see him mounted once again
5052,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Upon his nimble steed,"
5053,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Full slowly pacing o’er the stones,"
5054,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,With caution and good heed.
5055,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5056,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,But finding soon a smoother road
5057,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Beneath his well-shod feet,"
5058,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"The snorting beast began to trot,"
5059,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Which galled him in his seat.
5060,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5061,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"So, “Fair and softly,” John he cried,"
5062,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,But John he cried in vain;
5063,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"That trot became a gallop soon,"
5064,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,In spite of curb and rein.
5065,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5066,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"So stooping down, as needs he must"
5067,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Who cannot sit upright,"
5068,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"He grasped the mane with both his hands,"
5069,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,And eke with all his might.
5070,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5071,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"His horse, who never in that sort"
5072,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Had handled been before,"
5073,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,What thing upon his back had got
5074,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Did wonder more and more.
5075,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5076,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Away went Gilpin, neck or nought;"
5077,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Away went hat and wig;
5078,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"He little dreamt, when he set out,"
5079,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Of running such a rig.
5080,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5081,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,"
5082,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Like streamer long and gay,"
5083,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Till, loop and button failing both,"
5084,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,At last it flew away.
5085,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5086,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Then might all people well discern
5087,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,The bottles he had slung;
5088,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"A bottle swinging at each side,"
5089,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,As hath been said or sung.
5090,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5091,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"The dogs did bark, the children screamed,"
5092,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Up flew the windows all;
5093,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And every soul cried out, “Well done!”"
5094,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,As loud as he could bawl.
5095,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5096,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Away went Gilpin—who but he?
5097,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,His fame soon spread around;
5098,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,“He carries weight!”  “He rides a race!”
5099,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,“’Tis for a thousand pound!”
5100,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5101,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And still, as fast as he drew near,"
5102,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"’Twas wonderful to view,"
5103,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,How in a trice the turnpike-men
5104,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Their gates wide open threw.
5105,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5106,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And now, as he went bowing down"
5107,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"His reeking head full low,"
5108,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,The bottles twain behind his back
5109,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Were shattered at a blow.
5110,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5111,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Down ran the wine into the road,"
5112,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Most piteous to be seen,"
5113,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Which made his horse’s flanks to smoke
5114,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,As they had basted been.
5115,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5116,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"But still be seemed to carry weight,"
5117,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,With leathern girdle braced;
5118,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,For all might see the bottle-necks
5119,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Still dangling at his waist.
5120,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5121,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Thus all through merry Islington
5122,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"These gambols he did play,"
5123,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Until he came unto the Wash
5124,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Of Edmonton so gay;
5125,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5126,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,And there he threw the Wash about
5127,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"On both sides of the way,"
5128,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Just like unto a trundling mop,"
5129,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Or a wild goose at play.
5130,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5131,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,At Edmonton his loving wife
5132,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,From the balcóny spied
5133,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Her tender husband, wondering much"
5134,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,To see how he did ride.
5135,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5136,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"“Stop, stop, John Gilpin!—Here’s the house!”"
5137,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,They all at once did cry;
5138,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"“The dinner waits, and we are tired;”"
5139,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Said Gilpin—“So am I!”
5140,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5141,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,But yet his horse was not a whit
5142,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Inclined to tarry there!
5143,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,For why?—his owner had a house
5144,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Full ten miles off, at Ware."
5145,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5146,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"So like an arrow swift he flew,"
5147,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Shot by an archer strong;
5148,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,So did he fly—which brings me to
5149,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,The middle of my song.
5150,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5151,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Away went Gilpin, out of breath,"
5152,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And sore against his will,"
5153,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Till at his friend the calender’s
5154,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,His horse at last stood still.
5155,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5156,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"The calender, amazed to see"
5157,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"His neighbour in such trim,"
5158,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,"
5159,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,And thus accosted him:
5160,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5161,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,“What news? what news? your tidings tell!
5162,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Tell me you must and shall—
5163,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Say why bareheaded you are come,"
5164,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Or why you come at all?”
5165,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5166,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,"
5167,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,And loved a timely joke;
5168,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,And thus unto the calender
5169,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,In merry guise he spoke:
5170,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5171,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"“I came because your horse would come,"
5172,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And, if I well forbode,"
5173,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,My hat and wig will soon be here—
5174,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,They are upon the road.”
5175,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5176,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"The calender, right glad to find"
5177,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"His friend in merry pin,"
5178,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Returned him not a single word,"
5179,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,But to the house went in;
5180,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5181,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Whence straight he came with hat and wig;
5182,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"A wig that flowed behind,"
5183,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"A hat not much the worse for wear,"
5184,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Each comely in its kind.
5185,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5186,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"He held them up, and in his turn"
5187,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Thus showed his ready wit,"
5188,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"“My head is twice as big as yours,"
5189,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,They therefore needs must fit.
5190,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5191,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,“But let me scrape the dirt away
5192,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,That hangs upon your face;
5193,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And stop and eat, for well you may"
5194,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Be in a hungry case.”
5195,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5196,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Said John, “It is my wedding-day,"
5197,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And all the world would stare,"
5198,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"If wife should dine at Edmonton,"
5199,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,And I should dine at Ware.”
5200,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5201,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"So turning to his horse, he said,"
5202,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,“I am in haste to dine;
5203,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"’Twas for your pleasure you came here,"
5204,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,You shall go back for mine.”
5205,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5206,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Ah, luckless speech, and bootless boast!"
5207,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,For which he paid full dear;
5208,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"For, while he spake, a braying ass"
5209,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Did sing most loud and clear;
5210,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5211,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Whereat his horse did snort, as he"
5212,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Had heard a lion roar,"
5213,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And galloped off with all his might,"
5214,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,As he had done before.
5215,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5216,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Away went Gilpin, and away"
5217,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Went Gilpin’s hat and wig:
5218,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,He lost them sooner than at first;
5219,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,For why?—they were too big.
5220,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5221,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw"
5222,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Her husband posting down
5223,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Into the country far away,"
5224,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,She pulled out half-a-crown;
5225,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5226,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,And thus unto the youth she said
5227,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"That drove them to the Bell,"
5228,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"“This shall be yours, when you bring back"
5229,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,My husband safe and well.”
5230,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5231,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"The youth did ride, and soon did meet"
5232,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,John coming back amain:
5233,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Whom in a trice he tried to stop,"
5234,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,By catching at his rein;
5235,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5236,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"But not performing what he meant,"
5237,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And gladly would have done,"
5238,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,The frighted steed he frighted more
5239,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,And made him faster run.
5240,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5241,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Away went Gilpin, and away"
5242,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Went postboy at his heels,"
5243,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,The postboy’s horse right glad to miss
5244,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,The lumbering of the wheels.
5245,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5246,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Six gentlemen upon the road,"
5247,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Thus seeing Gilpin fly,"
5248,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"With postboy scampering in the rear,"
5249,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,They raised the hue and cry:
5250,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5251,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,“Stop thief! stop thief!—a highwayman!”
5252,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Not one of them was mute;
5253,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,And all and each that passed that way
5254,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Did join in the pursuit.
5255,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5256,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,And now the turnpike gates again
5257,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Flew open in short space;
5258,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"The toll-men thinking, as before,"
5259,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,That Gilpin rode a race.
5260,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5261,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And so he did, and won it too,"
5262,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,For he got first to town;
5263,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,Nor stopped till where he had got up
5264,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,He did again get down.
5265,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,
5266,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"Now let us sing, Long live the king!"
5267,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,"And Gilpin, long live he!"
5268,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,And when he next doth ride abroad
5269,BY WILLIAM COWPER.,May I be there to see!

6508,THE GAME OF OMBRE,THE GAME OF OMBRE
6509,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6510,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6511,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"was invented by the Spaniards, and called by them _El Hombre_, or THE"
6512,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"MAN, _El Hombre_ being he (or she) who undertakes the game against the"
6513,THE GAME OF OMBRE,other players.
6514,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6515,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"There were variations in the way of playing, and there were sometimes"
6516,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"four or even five players; but usually there were three players, as"
6517,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"described by Pope in the third canto of _The Rape of the Lock_, where"
6518,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"Belinda played as Ombre against the Baron and another, and the course of"
6519,THE GAME OF OMBRE,the game is faithfully described.  It is the purpose of this note to
6520,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"enable any reader of _The Rape of the Lock_ to learn the game of Ombre,"
6521,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"play it, and be able to follow Pope’s description of a game."
6522,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6523,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"The game of Ombre is played with a pack of cards from which the eights,"
6524,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"nines, and tens of each of the four suits have been thrown out.  The"
6525,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"Ombre pack consists, therefore, of forty cards."
6526,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6527,THE GAME OF OMBRE,The values of cards when they are not trumps are not arranged in the same
6528,THE GAME OF OMBRE,order for each colour.
6529,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6530,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"For the two black suits, Spades and Clubs, the values, from highest to"
6531,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"lowest, follow the natural order—King, Queen, Knave, seven, six, five,"
6532,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"four, three, two.  But the two black aces always rank as trumps, and are"
6533,THE GAME OF OMBRE,not reckoned as parts of the black suit.  The Ace of Spades is named
6534,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"_Spadille_, the Ace of Clubs is _Basto_."
6535,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6536,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"For the two red suits, Hearts and Diamonds, only the King, Queen, and"
6537,THE GAME OF OMBRE,Knave keep their values in natural order; the other cards have their
6538,THE GAME OF OMBRE,order of values reversed.  The value from highest to lowest for each red
6539,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"suit is, therefore, King, Queen, Knave, ace, two, three, four, five, six,"
6540,THE GAME OF OMBRE,seven.
6541,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6542,THE GAME OF OMBRE,The values of trump cards are thus arranged:—
6543,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6544,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"The first and best trump is the Ace of Spades, _Spadille_."
6545,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6546,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"The second best trump is the lowest card of the trump suit, the two of"
6547,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"trumps in a black suit, or the seven of trumps if the trump suit be red."
6548,THE GAME OF OMBRE,This second trump is called _Manille_.
6549,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6550,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"The third trump is the Ace of Clubs, _Basto_."
6551,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6552,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"When the trump suit is red, its Ace becomes the fourth trump.  Thus if"
6553,THE GAME OF OMBRE,Diamonds be trumps the Ace of Diamonds can take the King of Diamonds; the
6554,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"Ace of Hearts can take the King of Hearts if Hearts be trumps, not"
6555,THE GAME OF OMBRE,otherwise.  There is no addition to the value of the Ace of Diamonds when
6556,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"Hearts are trumps.  The Ace of a red suit of trumps, having become in"
6557,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"this way the fourth trump in order of value, is called _Punto_."
6558,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6559,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"In order of their value, counted from the highest to the lowest, I now"
6560,THE GAME OF OMBRE,place in parallel columns the trumps in black suits and the trumps in
6561,THE GAME OF OMBRE,red:—
6562,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6563,THE GAME OF OMBRE,Black.                               Red.

6577,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6578,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"The three chief trumps, _Spadille_, _Manille_, and _Basto_, are called"
6579,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"_Matadores_, and have powers which, together with their name, are passed"
6580,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"to the trumps following them, so far as they are found in sequence in the"
6581,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"Ombre’s hand.  Thus, although _Spadille_, _Manille_, and _Basto_ are"
6582,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"strictly speaking the only _Matadores_, if the Ombre can show also in his"
6583,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"hand, say, in the red suit, Punto, King, Queen, Knave, he takes for seven"
6584,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"_Matadores_; and if there should be joined to these the two and three,"
6585,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"his trumps would be all in sequence, every card would be a _Matadore_,"
6586,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"and he would be paid for nine, which is the whole number of cards in a"
6587,THE GAME OF OMBRE,hand.
6588,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6589,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"Counters having been distributed, among which a fish is worth ten round"
6590,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"counters, each player lays down a fish before the deal.  The cards having"
6591,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"been shuffled by the dealer, and cut by the player who sits on the left"
6592,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"hand of the dealer, are dealt three at a time, and first to the player"
6593,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"who sits on the dealer’s right hand, which is contrary to the usual"
6594,THE GAME OF OMBRE,course.  The cards are dealt three times round.  Each of the three
6595,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"players then has nine, and the remaining thirteen cards are laid down at"
6596,THE GAME OF OMBRE,the right hand of the dealer.  No card is turned up to determine trumps.
6597,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6598,THE GAME OF OMBRE,Each player then looks at his hand.  The eldest hand is that to the
6599,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"dealer’s right.  He speaks first.  If his cards are bad, and he will not"
6600,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"venture to be Ombre, he says “Pass,” and lays a counter down at his left."
6601,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"If all three players say “Pass,” each laying a counter down, the cards"
6602,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"are dealt again.  When a player thinks his cards may win, and is willing"
6603,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"to be Ombre, unless he be the third to speak, and the two other hands"
6604,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"have passed, he says “Do you give me leave?” or “Do you play without"
6605,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"taking in?”  If the other players say “Pass,” each depositing his counter"
6606,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"at his own left hand, the Ombre begins by discarding from his hand two,"
6607,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"three, or more cards that he thinks unserviceable.  He lays them down at"
6608,THE GAME OF OMBRE,his left hand. Then before he deals to himself from the pack of thirteen
6609,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"left undistributed the same number of cards that he has thrown out, he"
6610,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"must name the trump suit.  In doing this he chooses for himself,"
6611,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"according to his hand, spades, clubs, hearts, diamonds, whichever suit he"
6612,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"thinks will best help him to win.  If he has a two of a black suit, or a"
6613,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"seven of a red, he can secure to himself _Manille_ by making that suit"
6614,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"trumps, or there may be reason why another suit should be preferred."
6615,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6616,THE GAME OF OMBRE,If the player who proposes to be Ombre has a safe game in his hand—five
6617,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"_Matadores_, for example—he names the trump and elects to play"
6618,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"_Sans-prendre_, that is to say, without discarding.  Whoever plays"
6619,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"_Sans-prendre_, if he win, receives three counters from each of the other"
6620,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"players, and pays three counters to each if he should lose the game."
6621,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6622,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"When the Ombre plays _Sans-Prendre_, his opponents have more cards from"
6623,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"which to draw, and the first who discards is even free to change all his"
6624,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"nine cards; but he usually limits his discard to six or seven, and avoids"
6625,THE GAME OF OMBRE,encroachment on the share of the next player.  The two who play against
6626,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"the Ombre are only half in the position of partners at whist, because one"
6627,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"of them, when his hand is strong enough, can be the only winner."
6628,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6629,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"The hands having been thus settled, the game begins, from the hand on the"
6630,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"right of the dealer.  After a trick has been taken, the lead, as at other"
6631,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"games, is with the winner of the trick, the order of play being still"
6632,THE GAME OF OMBRE,from left to right.
6633,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6634,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"As at whist, a suit led must be followed, and a player who cannot follow"
6635,THE GAME OF OMBRE,suit is not obliged to play a trump unless he please.
6636,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6637,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"If the first player who follows the Ombre’s lead with a better card, and"
6638,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"has in his hand so good a game that he desires, by winning the trick, to"
6639,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"obtain the lead, he declares that aloud by saying _Gano_, that is, “I"
6640,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"win.”  His partner then lets him win, if he can.  Thus, Ombre has played"
6641,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"a spade, which the next player wins with the Queen, saying _Gano_ when he"
6642,THE GAME OF OMBRE,does so.  If the third player has the King in his hand he refrains from
6643,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"playing it, unless he have no spade in his hand of smaller value, in"
6644,THE GAME OF OMBRE,which case he is obliged to follow suit and win the trick against his
6645,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"partner.  Where the lead is urgently desired, not for a personal gain of"
6646,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"more tricks than the Ombre, which is called _Codille_, but to defend the"
6647,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"stake, and the third player is seen to hesitate, _Gano_ may be pressed"
6648,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"for, three times, “Gano, if possible.”  When Ombre was played by gambling"
6649,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"courtiers under Queen Anne and George I., all such words spoken in the"
6650,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"game had to be given strictly in the Spanish form, which was, in this"
6651,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"case, _Yo Gano_, _si se puede_."
6652,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6653,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"Ombre, to win the stake, must make five tricks; but he can win with four"
6654,THE GAME OF OMBRE,if the other five are so divided between his antagonists that one has
6655,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"only three of them, the other only two.  If one of the two defenders of"
6656,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"the stakes, playing against Ombre, does not feel almost sure that he can"
6657,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"win at least three tricks, with a chance of the fourth, he should win"
6658,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"one, and try to avoid winning more, but help whatever chance his partner"
6659,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"seems to have of winning four, because Ombre wins with four when each of"
6660,THE GAME OF OMBRE,the other players has won less than four.
6661,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6662,THE GAME OF OMBRE,If Ombre lose he is said to be Beasted.  Whoever loses is said to be
6663,THE GAME OF OMBRE,Beasted.  Whoever is Beasted has to pay to the board counters of the
6664,THE GAME OF OMBRE,value of what the Ombre takes up if he wins.  When players were beasted
6665,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"for revokes and other oversights in play, the fines were heavy upon"
6666,THE GAME OF OMBRE,carelessness.
6667,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6668,THE GAME OF OMBRE,At the end of the game tricks are counted.  When Ombre wins he takes the
6669,THE GAME OF OMBRE,stakes; when he loses the two opponents will divide the stakes between
6670,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"them, unless one of them should have taken more tricks than the Ombre, in"
6671,THE GAME OF OMBRE,which case that one is said to have won _Codille_.  Whoever wins
6672,THE GAME OF OMBRE,_Codille_ takes all the stake the Ombre played for.  For this reason it
6673,THE GAME OF OMBRE,was not thought creditable for any one to call _Gano_ who had four tricks
6674,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"in his hand, as by so doing he would only be inducing the other player"
6675,THE GAME OF OMBRE,against Ombre to give up to him his half of the winnings.  Each player
6676,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"against the Ombre aims at _Codille_ when he thinks it within reach, but"
6677,THE GAME OF OMBRE,in that case it used to be held very bad manners to win by calling
6678,THE GAME OF OMBRE,_Gano_.  When one of the players against the Ombre must either give
6679,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"_Codille_ to the other or let the Ombre win, he gives the _Codille_.  For"
6680,THE GAME OF OMBRE,if the Ombre be beasted he has to replace the stakes.  But if the Ombre
6681,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"wins, both of the players against him have to stake again.  If any one"
6682,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"wins all the nine tricks he is said to have won the _Vole_, and clears"
6683,THE GAME OF OMBRE,all stakes upon the table.
6684,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6685,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"Belinda, in the _Rape of the Lock_, having looked at her hand, named"
6686,THE GAME OF OMBRE,trumps—
6687,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6688,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"“‘Let spades be trumps,’ she said, and trumps they were.”"
6689,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6690,THE GAME OF OMBRE,She chose that suit because she had not only the King but also the two of
6691,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"Spades, and two of trumps, called _Manille_, is the second best trump"
6692,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"after _Spadille_.  Her hand contained also the Ace of Spades,"
6693,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"“unconquerable lord” _Spadille_, and the third trump, _Basto_, Ace of"
6694,THE GAME OF OMBRE,Clubs.  By making spades trumps she secured the addition of _Manille_.
6695,THE GAME OF OMBRE,The three best trumps secured her the three best tricks.  _Spadille_ and
6696,THE GAME OF OMBRE,_Manille_ fetched small trumps out of the hands of her antagonists.
6697,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"_Basto_ brought a trump out of the Baron’s suit, that also held the Knave"
6698,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"and Queen of trumps, and a small card from the other hand, which showed"
6699,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"that it was out of trumps.  Then came Belinda’s King of trumps, to win"
6700,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"her fourth sure trick, and the Baron, who still had his best trumps in"
6701,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"his hand, the Knave and Queen, lost the Knave to it."
6702,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6703,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"After this the Baron’s Queen of trumps was the best card, and Belinda,"
6704,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"with no more trumps in her hand, or possibly the other player, sacrificed"
6705,THE GAME OF OMBRE,the King of Clubs to it.
6706,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6707,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"Trumps being exhausted, and the Baron having won a trick and the lead, it"
6708,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"is his turn now to win three tricks in succession with the King, Queen,"
6709,THE GAME OF OMBRE,and Knave of Diamonds.  At the third round of the Diamonds Belinda has
6710,THE GAME OF OMBRE,left in her hand only the King and Queen of Hearts.  She gives up the
6711,THE GAME OF OMBRE,Queen.
6712,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6713,THE GAME OF OMBRE,Each has now four tricks.  It is the Baron’s lead.  If his card be best
6714,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"he has more tricks than the Ombre, and will win _Codille_.  If his card"
6715,THE GAME OF OMBRE,be a club or a diamond—spades are played out—Belinda’s King of Hearts
6716,THE GAME OF OMBRE,will be unable to follow suit.  He will be taken.  Thus is she “between
6717,THE GAME OF OMBRE,the jaws of ruin and codille.”  But should his last card be a heart—she
6718,THE GAME OF OMBRE,has the best heart—
6719,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6720,THE GAME OF OMBRE,“An Ace of Hearts steps forth: the King unseen
6721,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"Lurked in her hand, and mourned his captive Queen."
6722,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"He springs to vengeance with an eager pace,"
6723,THE GAME OF OMBRE,And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace.
6724,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"The nymph exulting, fills with shouts the sky,"
6725,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"The walls, the woods, the long canals reply.”"
6726,THE GAME OF OMBRE,
6727,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"In addition to the stakes she won, Belinda was entitled also to the value"
6728,THE GAME OF OMBRE,of four counters from each of her antagonists for her sequence of four
6729,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"_Matadores_, _Spadille_, _Manille_, _Basto_, and the King of Spades."
6730,THE GAME OF OMBRE,"Furthermore, if she had been playing _Sans-prendre_, each of her"

7007,FOOTNOTES.,
7008,FOOTNOTES.,{26}  The sententious sermon which here follows might have had a purely
7009,FOOTNOTES.,"serious intention in Chaucer’s time, when books were rare, and moralities"
7010,FOOTNOTES.,not such commonplaces as they are now; yet it is difficult to believe
7011,FOOTNOTES.,that the poet did not intend something of a covert satire upon at least
7012,FOOTNOTES.,"the sermoniser’s own pretensions, especially as the latter had declared"
7013,FOOTNOTES.,"himself against text-spinning.  The Host, it is to be observed, had"
7014,FOOTNOTES.,"already charged him with forgetting his own faults, while preaching"
7015,FOOTNOTES.,against those of others. The _refashioner_ of the original lines has
7016,FOOTNOTES.,"accordingly endeavoured to retain the kind of tabernacle, or old woman’s"
7017,FOOTNOTES.,"tone, into which he conceives the Manciple to have fallen, compared with"
7018,FOOTNOTES.,that of his narrative style.—_Leigh Hunt_.
7019,FOOTNOTES.,
7020,FOOTNOTES.,"{42}  “We possess,” says Satan in _Paradise Lost_, “the quarters of the"

7023,FOOTNOTES.,"which that legend was constructed (Isa. xiv. 12–15), “Thou hast said in"

7040,FOOTNOTES.,
7041,FOOTNOTES.,The coincidence of the last line with the one quoted from Gray’s Elegy
7042,FOOTNOTES.,will be remarked.  Mr. Tyrwhit says he should certainly have considered
7043,FOOTNOTES.,"the latter as an “imitation” (of Chaucer), “if Mr. Gray himself had not"

7049,FOOTNOTES.,
7050,FOOTNOTES.,The sentiment is different in all three; but the form of expression here
7051,FOOTNOTES.,"adopted by Gray closely resembles that of the Father of English Poetry,"

7053,FOOTNOTES.,Petrarch than Chaucer.—_R. H. Horne_.
