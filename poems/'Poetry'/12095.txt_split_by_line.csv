30,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Ab ira et odio, et omni mala voluntate,"
31,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Libera nos, Domine."
32,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"A fulgure et tempestate,"
33,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Libera nos, Domine."

36,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
37,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"So rang forth the supplication, echoing from rock and fell, as the"
38,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,people of Claudiodunum streamed forth in the May sunshine to invoke
39,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"a blessing on the cornlands, olives, and vineyards that won vantage-"
40,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,ground on the terraces carefully kept up on the slopes of the
41,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,wonderful needle-shaped hills of Auvergne.
42,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
43,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Very recently had the Church of Gaul commenced the custom of going
44,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"forth, on the days preceding the Ascension feast, to chant Litanies,"
45,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"calling down the Divine protection on field and fold, corn and wine,"
46,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,basket and store.  It had been begun in a time of deadly peril from
47,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"famine and earthquake, wild beast and wilder foes, and it had been"
48,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"adopted in the neighbouring dioceses as a regular habit, as indeed"
49,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,it continued throughout the Western Church during the fourteen
50,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,subsequent centuries.
51,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
52,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,One great procession was formed by different bands.  The children
53,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"were in two troops, a motley collection of all shades; the deep"
54,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,olive and the rolling black eye betraying Ethiopian or Moorish slave
55,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"ancestry, the soft dark complexion and deep brown eye showing the"
56,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Roman, and the rufous hair and freckled skin the lower grade of"
57,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Cymric Kelt, while a few had the more stately pose, violet eye, and"
58,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,black hair of the Gael.  The boys were marshalled with extreme
59,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,difficulty by two or three young monks; their sisters walked far
60,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"more orderly, under the care of some consecrated virgin of mature"
61,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"age.  The men formed another troop, the hardy mountaineers still"
62,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"wearing the Gallic trousers and plaid, though the artisans and"
63,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,mechanics from the town were clad in the tunic and cloak that were
64,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the later Roman dress, and such as could claim the right folded over"
65,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"them the white, purple-edged scarf to which the toga had dwindled."
66,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
67,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Among the women there was the same scale of decreasing nationality
68,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"of costume according to rank, though the culmination was in"
69,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,resemblance to the graceful classic robe of Rome instead of the last
70,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Parisian mode.  The poorer women wore bright, dark crimson, or blue"
71,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"in gown or wrapping veil; the ladies were mostly in white or black,"
72,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"as were also the clergy, excepting such as had officiated at the"
73,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"previous Eucharist, and who wore their brilliant priestly vestments,"
74,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,heavy with gold and embroidery.
75,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
76,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Beautiful alike to eye and ear was the procession, above all from a"
77,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"distance, now filing round a delicate young green wheatfield, now"
78,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"lost behind a rising hill, now glancing through a vineyard, or"
79,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"contrasting with the gray tints of the olive, all that was"
80,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"incongruous or disorderly unseen, and all that was discordant"
81,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"unheard, as only the harmonious cadence of the united response was"
82,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"wafted fitfully on the breeze to the two elderly men who, unable to"
83,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"scale the wild mountain paths in the procession, had, after the"
84,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,previous service in the basilica and the blessing of the nearer
85,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"lands, returned to the villa, where they sat watching its progress."
86,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
87,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,It was as entirely a Roman villa as the form of the ground and the
88,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"need of security would permit.  Lying on the slope of a steep hill,"
89,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,which ran up above into a fantastic column or needle piercing the
90,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"sky, the courts of the villa were necessarily a succession of"
91,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"terraces, levelled and paved with steps of stone or marble leading"
92,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"from one to the other.  A strong stone wall enclosed the whole,"
93,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"cloistered, as a protection from sun and storm.  The lowest court"
94,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"had a gateway strongly protected, and thence a broad walk with box-"
95,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"trees on either side, trimmed into fantastic shapes, led through a"
96,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"lawn laid out in regular flower-beds to the second court, which was"
97,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"paved with polished marble, and had a fountain in the midst, with"
98,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"vases of flowers, and seats around.  Above was another broad flight"
99,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"of stone steps, leading to a portico running along the whole front"
100,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"of the house, with the principal chambers opening into it.  Behind"
101,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"lay another court, serving as stables for the horses and mules, as"
102,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"farmyard, and with the quarters of the slaves around it, and higher"
103,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,up there stretched a dense pine forest protecting the whole
104,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,establishment from avalanches and torrents of stones from the
105,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,mountain peak above.
106,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
107,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Under the portico, whose pillars were cut from the richly-coloured"
108,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"native marbles, reposed the two friends on low couches."
109,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
110,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"One was a fine-looking man, with a grand bald forehead, encircled"
111,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"with a wreath of oak, showing that in his time he had rescued a"
112,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Roman's life.  He also wore a richly-embroidered purple toga, the"
113,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"token of high civic rank, for he had put on his full insignia as a"
114,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,senator and of consular rank to do honour to the ceremonial.  Indeed
115,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"he would not have abstained from accompanying the procession, but"
116,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"that his guest, though no more aged than himself, was manifestly"
117,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"unequal to the rugged expedition, begun fasting in the morning chill"
118,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"and concluded, likewise fasting, in the noonday heat.  Still, it"
119,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"would scarcely have distressed those sturdy limbs, well developed"
120,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"and preserved by Roman training, never permitted by him to"
121,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,degenerate into effeminacy.  And as his fine countenance and well-
122,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"knit frame testified, Marcus AEmilius Victorinus inherited no small"
123,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,share of genuine Roman blood.  His noble name might be derived
124,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"through clientela, and his lineage had a Gallic intermixture; but"
125,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,the true Quirite predominated in his character and temperament.  The
126,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,citizenship of his family dated back beyond the first establishment
127,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"of the colony, and rank, property, and personal qualities alike"
128,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"rendered him the first man in the district, its chief magistrate,"
129,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"and protector from the Visigoths, who claimed it as part of their"
130,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,kingdom of Aquitania.
131,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
132,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,So much of the spirit of Vercingetorix survived among the remnant of
133,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"his tribe that Arvernia had never been overrun and conquered, but"
134,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,had held out until actually ceded by one of the degenerate Augusti
135,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"at Ravenna, and then favourable terms had been negotiated, partly by"
136,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"AEmilius the Senator, as he was commonly called, and partly by the"
137,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"honoured friend who sat beside him, another relic of the good old"
138,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,times when Southern Gaul enjoyed perfect peace as a favoured
139,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,province of the Empire.  This guest was a man of less personal
140,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"beauty than the Senator, and more bowed and aged, but with care and"
141,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"ill-health more than years, for the two had been comrades in school,"
142,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"fellow-soldiers and magistrates, working simultaneously, and with"
143,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"firm, mutual trust all their days."
144,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
145,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"The dress of the visitor was shaped like that of the senator, but of"
146,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,somewhat richer and finer texture.  He too wore the TOGA
147,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"PRAETEXTATA, but he had a large gold cross hanging on his breast and"
148,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,an episcopal ring on his finger; and instead of the wreath of bay he
149,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"might have worn, and which encircled his bust in the Capitol, the"
150,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,scanty hair on his finely-moulded head showed the marks of the
151,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,tonsure.  His brow was a grand and expansive one; his gray eyes were
152,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"full of varied expression, keen humour, and sagacity; a lofty"
153,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"devotion sometimes changing his countenance in a wonderful manner,"
154,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"even in the present wreck of his former self, when the cheeks showed"
155,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"furrows worn by care and suffering, and the once flexible and"
156,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,resolute mouth had fallen in from loss of teeth.  For this was the
157,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"scholar, soldier, poet, gentleman, letter-writer, statesman,"
158,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Sidonius Apollinaris, who had stood on the steps of the Imperial"
159,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"throne of the West, had been crowned as an orator in the Capitol,"
160,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,and then had been called by the exigences of his country to give up
161,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,his learned ease and become the protector of the Arvernii as a
162,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"patriot Bishop, where he had well and nobly served his God and his"
163,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"country, and had won the respect, not only of the Catholic Gauls but"
164,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"of the Arian Goths.  Jealousy and evil tongues had, however,"
165,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"prevailed to cause his banishment from his beloved hills, and when"
166,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,he repaired to the court of King Euric to solicit permission to
167,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"return, he was long detained there, and had only just obtained"
168,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,license to go back to his See.  He had arrived only a day or two
169,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"previously at the villa, exhausted by his journey, and though"
170,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"declaring that his dear mountain breezes must needs restore him, and"
171,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"that it was a joy to inhale them, yet, as he heard of the"
172,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"oppressions that were coming on his people, the mountain gales could"
173,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"only 'a momentary bliss bestow,' and AEmilius justly feared that the"
174,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,decay of his health had gone too far for even the breezes and baths
175,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,of Arvernia to reinvigorate him.
176,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
177,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"His own mountain estate, where dwelt his son, was of difficult"
178,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"access early in the year, and AEmilius hoped to persuade him to rest"
179,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"in the villa till after Pentecost, and then to bless the nuptials of"
180,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Columba AEmilia, the last unwedded daughter of the house, with Titus"
181,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Julius Verronax, a young Arvernian chief of the lineage of"
182,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Vercingetorix, highly educated in all Latin and Greek culture, and a"
183,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Roman citizen much as a Highland chieftain is an Englishman.  His
184,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"home was on an almost inaccessible peak, or PUY, which the Senator"
185,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"pointed out to the Bishop, saying--"
186,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
187,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""I would fain secure such a refuge for my family in case the tyranny"
188,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"of the barbarians should increase."""
189,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
190,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Are there any within the city?"" asked the Bishop.  ""I rejoice to"
191,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,see that thou art free from the indignity of having any quartered
192,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"upon thee."""
193,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
194,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""For which I thank Heaven,"" responded the Senator.  ""The nearest are"
195,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"on the farm of Deodatus, in the valley.  There is a stout old"
196,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,warrior named Meinhard who calls himself of the King's Trust; not a
197,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"bad old fellow in himself to deal with, but with endless sons,"
198,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"followers, and guests, whom poor Deodatus and Julitta have to keep"
199,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"supplied with whatever they choose to call for, being forced to"
200,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"witness their riotous orgies night after night."""
201,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
202,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Even so, we are far better off than our countrymen who have the"
203,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"heathen Franks for their lords."""
204,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
205,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""That Heaven forbid!"" said AEmilius.  ""These Goths are at least"
206,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Christians, though heretics, yet I shall be heartily glad when the"
207,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,circuit of Deodatus's fields is over.  The good man would not have
208,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"them left unblest, but the heretical barbarians make it a point of"
209,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"honour not to hear the Blessed Name invoked without mockery, such as"
210,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"our youths may hardly brook."""
211,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
212,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""They are unarmed,"" said the Bishop."
213,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
214,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""True; but, as none knows better than thou dost, dear father and"
215,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"friend, the Arvernian blood has not cooled since the days of Caius"
216,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Julius Caesar, and offences are frequent among the young men.  So"
217,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"often has our community had to pay 'wehrgeld,' as the barbarians"
218,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"call the price they lay upon blood, that I swore at last that I"
219,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"would never pay it again, were my own son the culprit."""
220,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
221,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Such oaths are perilous,"" said Sidonius.  ""Hast thou never had"
222,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"cause to regret this?"""
223,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
224,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""My father, thou wouldst have thought it time to take strong"
225,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,measures to check the swaggering of our young men and the foolish
226,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,provocations that cost more than one life.  One would stick a
227,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,peacock's feather in his cap and go strutting along with folded arms
228,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"and swelling breast, and when the Goths scowled at him and called"
229,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"him by well-deserved names, a challenge would lead to a deadly"
230,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,combat.  Another such fight was caused by no greater offence than
231,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the treading on a dog's tail; but in that it was the Roman, or more"
232,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"truly the Gaul, who was slain, and I must say the 'wehrgeld' was"
233,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"honourably paid.  It is time, however, that such groundless"
234,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"conflicts should cease; and, in truth, only a barbarian could be"
235,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"satisfied to let gold atone for life."""
236,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
237,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""It is certainly neither Divine law nor human equity,"" said the"
238,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Bishop.  ""Yet where no distinction can be made between the"
239,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"deliberate murder and the hasty blow, I have seen cause to be"
240,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,thankful for the means of escaping the utmost penalty.  Has this
241,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"oath had the desired effect?"""
242,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
243,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""There has been only one case since it was taken,"" replied AEmilius."
244,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""That was a veritable murder.  A vicious, dissolute lad stabbed a"
245,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"wounded Goth in a lonely place, out of vengeful spite.  I readily"
246,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"delivered him up to the kinsfolk for justice, and as this proved me"
247,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"to be in earnest, these wanton outrages have become much more rare."
248,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Unfortunately, however, the fellow was son to one of the widows of"
249,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the Church--a holy woman, and a favourite of my little Columba, who"
250,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"daily feeds and tends the poor thing, and thinks her old father very"
251,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"cruel."""
252,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
253,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Alas! from the beginning the doom of the guilty has struck the"
254,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"innocent,"" said the Bishop."
255,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
256,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""In due retribution, as even the heathen knew.""   Perfect"
257,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,familiarity with the great Greek tragedians was still the mark of a
258,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"gentleman, and then Sidonius quoted from Sophocles--"
259,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
260,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
261,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Compass'd with dazzling light,"
262,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Throned on Olympus's height,"
263,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,His front the Eternal God uprears
264,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"By toils unwearied, and unaged by years;"
265,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Far back, through ages past,"
266,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Far on, through time to come,"
267,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Hath been, and still must last,"
268,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Sin's never-changing doom.
269,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
270,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
271,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,AEmilius capped it from AEschylus--
272,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
273,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
274,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,But Justice holds her equal scales
275,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,With ever-waking eye;
276,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,O'er some her vengeful might prevails
277,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,When their life's sun is high;
278,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,On some her vigorous judgments light
279,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"In that dread pause 'twixt day and night,"
280,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Life's closing, twilight hour."
281,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,But soon as once the genial plain
282,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Has drunk the life-blood of the slain,"
283,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Indelible the spots remain,"
284,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,And aye for vengeance call.
285,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
286,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
287,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Yea,"" said the Bishop, ""such was the universal law given to Noah"
288,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"ere the parting of the nations--blood for blood!  And yet, where"
289,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"should we be did not Mercy rejoice against Justice, and the Blood of"
290,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Sprinkling speak better things than the blood of Abel?  Nay, think"
291,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"not that I blame thee, my dear brother.  Thou art the judge of thy"
292,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"people, and well do I know that one act of stern justice often, as"
293,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"in this instance, prevents innumerable deeds of senseless violence."""
294,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
295,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Moreover,"" returned the Senator, ""it was by the relaxing of the"
296,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,ancient Roman sternness of discipline and resolution that the
297,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"horrors of the Triumvirate began, and that, later on, spirit decayed"
298,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"and brought us to our present fallen state."""
299,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
300,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"By this time the procession, which had long since passed from their"
301,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"sight, was beginning to break up and disperse.  A flock of little"
302,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"children first appeared, all of whom went aside to the slaves'"
303,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"quarters except one, who came running up the path between the box-"
304,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"trees.  He was the eldest grandson and namesake of the Senator, a"
305,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"dark-eyed, brown-haired boy of seven, with the golden bulla hanging"
306,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"round his neck.  Up he came to the old man's knee, proud to tell how"
307,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"he had scaled every rock, and never needed any help from the"
308,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,pedagogue slave who had watched over him.
309,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
310,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Sawest thou any barbarians, my Victorinus?"" asked his grandfather."
311,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
312,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""They stood thickly about Deodatus's door, and Publius said they"
313,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,were going to mock; but we looked so bold and sang so loud that they
314,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"durst not.  And Verronax is come down, papa, with Celer; and Celer"
315,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"wanted to sing too, but they would not let him, and he was so good"
316,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"that he was silent the moment his master showed him the leash."""
317,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
318,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Then is Celer a hound?"" asked the Bishop, amused."
319,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
320,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""A hound of the old stock that used to fight battles for Bituitus,"""
321,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"returned the child.  ""Oh, papa, I am so hungry."""
322,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
323,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"He really did say 'papa,' the fond domestic name which passed from"
324,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,the patriarch of the household to the Father of the Roman Church.
325,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
326,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Thy mother is watching for thee.  Run to her, and she will give"
327,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"thee a cake--aye, and a bath before thy dinner.  So Verronax is"
328,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"come.  I am glad thou wilt see him, my father.  The youth has grown"
329,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"up with my own children, and is as dear to me as my own son.  Ah,"
330,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"here comes my Columba!"""
331,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
332,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"For the maidens were by this time returning, and Columba, robed in"
333,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"white, with a black veil, worn mantilla fashion over her raven hair,"
334,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"so as to shade her soft, liquid, dark eyes, came up the steps, and"
335,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"with a graceful obeisance to her father and the Bishop, took the"
336,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,seat to which the former drew her beside them.
337,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
338,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Has all gone well, my little dove?"" asked her father."
339,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
340,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Perfectly well so far, my father,"" she replied; but there was"
341,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,anxiety in her eyes until the gate again opened and admitted the
342,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,male contingent of the procession.  No sooner had she seen them
343,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,safely advancing up the box avenue than she murmured something about
344,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"preparing for the meal, and, desiring a dismissal from her father,"
345,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"disappeared into the women's apartments, while the old man smiled at"
346,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,her pretty maidenly modesty.
347,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
348,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Of the three men who were advancing, one, Marcus AEmilius, about"
349,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"seven or eight and twenty years of age, was much what the Senator"
350,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"must have been at his age--sturdy, resolute, with keen eyes, and"
351,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"crisp, curled, short black hair.  His younger brother, Lucius, was"
352,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"taller, slighter, more delicately made, with the same pensive"
353,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Italian eyes as his sister, and a gentle, thoughtful countenance."
354,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"The tonsure had not yet touched his soft, dark brown locks; but it"
355,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"was the last time he would march among the laity, for, both by his"
356,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"own desire and that of his dead mother, he was destined to the"
357,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,priesthood.  Beside these two brothers came a much taller figure.
358,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"The Arvernii seem to have been Gael rather than Cymri, and the"
359,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"mountain chief, Titus Julius Verronax, as the Romans rendered his"
360,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"name of Fearnagh, was of the purest descent.  He had thick, wavy"
361,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"chestnut hair, not cut so short as that of the Romans, though kept"
362,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"with the same care.  His eyebrows were dark, his eyes, both in hue"
363,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"and brightness, like a hawk's, his features nobly moulded, and his"
364,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"tall form, though large and stately, was in perfect symmetry, and"
365,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,had the free bearing and light springiness befitting a mountaineer.
366,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"He wore the toga as an official scarf, but was in his national garb"
367,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"of the loose trousers and short coat, and the gold torq round his"
368,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,neck had come to him from prehistoric ages.  He had the short Roman
369,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"sword in his belt, and carried in his hand a long hunting-spear,"
370,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"without which he seldom stirred abroad, as it served him both as"
371,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,alpenstock and as defence against the wolves and bears of the
372,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"mountains.  Behind him stalked a magnificent dog, of a kind"
373,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"approaching the Irish wolfhound, a perfect picture of graceful"
374,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"outline and of strength, swiftness, and dignity, slightly shaggy,"
375,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,and of tawny colouring--in all respects curiously like his master.
376,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
377,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"In language, learning, and manners Verronax the Arvernian was,"
378,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"however, a highly cultivated Roman, as Sidonius perceived in the"
379,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,first word of respectful welcome that he spoke when presented to the
380,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Bishop.
381,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
382,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"All had gone off well.  Old Meinhard had been on the watch, and had"
383,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"restrained any insult, if such had been intended, by the other"
384,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Goths, who had stood watching in silence the blessing of the fields"
385,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,and vineyards of Deodatus.
386,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
387,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"The peril over, the AEmilian household partook cheerfully of the"
388,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"social meal.  Marina, the wife of Marcus, and Columba sat on carved"
389,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"chairs, the men of the family reclining on the couches constructed"
390,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"to hold three.  The bright wit of Sidonius, an eminent"
391,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"conversationalist, shone the more brightly for his rejoicing at his"
392,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"return to his beloved country and flock, and to the friend of his"
393,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,youth.  There were such gleams in the storms that were overwhelming
394,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the tottering Empire, to which indeed these men belonged only in"
395,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,heart and in name.
396,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
397,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"The meal was for a fast day, and consisted of preparations of eggs,"
398,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"milk, flour, and fish from the mountain streams, but daintily"
399,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"cooked, for the traditions of the old Roman gastronomy survived, and"
400,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Marina, though half a Gaul, was anxious that her housekeeping should"
401,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"shine in the eyes of the Bishop, who in his secular days had been"
402,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,known to have a full appreciation of the refinements of the table.
403,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
404,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"When the family rose and the benediction had been pronounced,"
405,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Columba was seen collecting some of the remnants in a basket.
406,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
407,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Thou surely dost not intend going to that widow of thine to-day,"""
408,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"exclaimed her sister-in-law, Marina, ""after such a walk on the"

410,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
411,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Indeed I must, sister,"" replied Columba; ""she was in much pain and"
412,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"weakness yesterday, and needs me more than usual."""
413,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
414,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""And it is close to the farm of Deodatus,"" Marina continued to"
415,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"object, ""where, the slaves tell me, there are I know not how many"
416,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"fresh barbarian guests!"""
417,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
418,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""I shall of course take Stentor and Athenais,"" said Columba."

422,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
423,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""I will guard my sister,"" said Lucius, becoming aware of what was"
424,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,passing.
425,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
426,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Who should escort her save myself?"" said the graceful Verronax,"
427,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,turning at the same moment from replying to some inquiries from the
428,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Bishop.
429,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
430,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""I doubt whether his escort be not the most perilous thing of all,"""
431,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,sighed Marina.
432,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
433,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Come, Marina,"" said her husband good-humouredly, ""be not always a"
434,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"boder of ill.  Thou deemest a Goth worse than a gorgon or hydra,"
435,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"whereas, I assure you, they are very good fellows after all, if you"
436,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"stand up to them like a man, and trust their word.  Old Meinhard is"
437,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"a capital hunting comrade."""
438,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
439,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Wherewith the worthy Marcus went off with his little son at his
440,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,heels to inspect the doings of the slaves in the farm-court in the
441,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"rear, having no taste for the occupation of his father and the"
442,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Bishop, who composed themselves to listen to a MS. of the letters of"
443,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"S. Gregory Nazianzen, which Sidonius had lately acquired, and which"
444,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,was read aloud to them by a secretary slave.
445,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
446,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Some time had thus passed when a confused sound made the Senator
447,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,start up.  He beheld his daughter and her escort within the lower
448,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"court, but the slaves were hastily barring the gates behind them,"
449,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"and loud cries of ""Justice!  Vengeance!"" in the Gothic tongue,"
450,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,struck his only too well-accustomed ears.
451,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
452,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Columba flung herself before him, crying--"
453,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
454,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""O father, have pity!  It was for our holy faith."""
455,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
456,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""He blasphemed,"" was all that was uttered by Verronax, on whose"
457,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,dress there was blood.
458,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
459,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Open the gates,"" called out the Senator, as the cry outside waxed"
460,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"louder.  ""None shall cry for justice in vain at the gate of an"
461,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"AEmilius.  Go, Marcus, admit such as have a right to enter and be"
462,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"heard.  Rise, my daughter, show thyself a true Roman and Christian"
463,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"maiden before these barbarians.  And thou, my son, alas, what hast"
464,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"thou done?"" he added, turning to Verronax, and taking his arm while"
465,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"walking towards the tribunal, where he did justice as chief"
466,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,magistrate of the Roman settlement.
467,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
468,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,A few words told all.  While Columba was engaged with her sick
469,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"widow, a young stranger Goth strolled up, one who had stood combing"
470,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"his long fair hair, and making contemptuous gestures as the Rogation"
471,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,procession passed in the morning.  He and his comrades began
472,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,offensively to scoff at the two young men for having taken part in
473,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the procession, uttering the blasphemies which the invocation of our"
474,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Blessed Lord was wont to call forth.
475,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
476,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Verronax turned wrathfully round, a hasty challenge passed, a rapid"
477,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,exchange of blows; and while the Arvernian received only a slight
478,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"scratch, the Goth fell slain before the hovel.  His comrades were"
479,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,unarmed and intimidated.  They rushed back to fetch weapons from the
480,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"house of Deodatus, and there had been full time to take Columba"
481,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"safely home, Verronax and his dog stalking statelily in the rear as"
482,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,her guardians.
483,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
484,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Thou shouldst have sought thine impregnable crag, my son,"" said the"
485,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Senator sadly.
486,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
487,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""To bring the barbarian vengeance upon this house?"" responded"
488,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Verronax.
489,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
490,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Alas, my son, thou know'st mine oath."""
491,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
492,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""I know it, my father."""
493,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
494,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""It forbids not thy ransoming thyself."""
495,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
496,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Verronax smiled slightly, and touched the collar at his throat."
497,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
498,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""This is all the gold that I possess."""
499,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
500,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,The Senator rapidly appraised it with his eye.  There was a regular
501,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"tariff on the lives of free Romans, free Goths, guests, and trusted"
502,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"men of the King; and if the deceased were merely a LITE, or freeman"
503,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"of the lowest rank, it was just possible that the gold collar might"
504,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"purchase its master's life, provided he were not too proud to part"
505,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,with the ancestral badge.
506,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
507,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,By this time the tribunal had been reached--a special portion of the
508,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"peristyle, with a curule chair, inlaid with ivory, placed on a"
509,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"tesselated pavement, as in the old days of the Republic, and a"
510,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"servant on each side held the lictor's axe and bundle of rods, which"
511,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"betokened stern Roman justice, wellnigh a mockery now.  The forum of"
512,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the city would have been the regular place, but since an earthquake"
513,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"had done much damage there, and some tumults had taken place among"
514,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the citizens, the seat of judgment had by general consent been"
515,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"placed in the AEmilian household as the place of chief security, and"
516,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"as he was the accredited magistrate with their Gothic masters, as"
517,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Sidonius had been before his banishment.
518,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
519,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"As Sidonius looked at the grave face of the Senator, set like a"
520,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"rock, but deadly pale, he thought it was no unworthy representative"
521,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,of Brutus or Manlius of old who sat on that seat.
522,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
523,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Alas! would he not be bound by his fatal oath to be only too true a
524,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,representative of their relentless justice?
525,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
526,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"On one side of the judgment-seat stood Verronax, towering above all"
527,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"around; behind him Marina and Columba, clinging together, trembling"
528,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"and tearful, but their weeping restrained by the looks of the"
529,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Senator, and by a certain remnant of hope."
530,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
531,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"To the other side advanced the Goths, all much larger and taller men"
532,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,than any one except the young Gaulish chieftain.  The foremost was a
533,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"rugged-looking veteran, with grizzled locks and beard, and a"
534,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"sunburnt face.  This was Meinhard, the head of the garrison on"
535,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Deodatus's farm, a man well known to AEmilius, and able to speak"
536,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Latin enough to hold communication with the Romans.  Several younger
537,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"men pressed rudely behind him, but they were evidently impressed by"
538,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the dignity of the tribunal, though it was with a loud and fierce"
539,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,shout that they recognised Verronax standing so still and unmoved.
540,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
541,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Silence!"" exclaimed the Senator, lifting his ivory staff."
542,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
543,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Meinhard likewise made gestures to hush them, and they ceased, while"
544,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the Senator, greeting Meinhard and inviting him to share his seat of"
545,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"authority, demanded what they asked."
546,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
547,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Right!"" was their cry.  ""Right on the slayer of Odorik, the son of"
548,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Odo, of the lineage of Odin, our guest, and of the King's trust."""
549,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
550,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Right shall ye have, O Goths,"" returned AEmilius.  ""A Roman never"
551,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,flinches from justice.  Who are witnesses to the deed?  Didst thou
552,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"behold it, O Meinhard, son of Thorulf?"""
553,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
554,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""No, noble AEmilius.  It had not been wrought had I been present;"
555,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"but here are those who can avouch it.  Stand forth, Egilulf, son of"
556,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Amalrik."""
557,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
558,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""It needs not,"" said Verronax.  ""I acknowledge the deed.  The Goth"
559,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,scoffed at us for invoking a created Man.  I could not stand by to
560,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"hear my Master insulted, and I smote him, but in open fight, whereof"
561,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"I bear the token."""
562,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
563,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""That is true,"" said Meinhard.  ""I know that Verronax, the"
564,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Arvernian, would strike no coward blow.  Therefore did I withhold"
565,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,these comrades of Odorik from rushing on thee in their fury; but
566,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"none the less art thou in feud with Odo, the father of Odorik, who"
567,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"will require of thee either thy blood or the wehrgeld."""
568,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
569,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Wehrgeld I have none to pay,"" returned Verronax, in the same calm"
570,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,voice.
571,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
572,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""I have sworn!"" said AEmilius in a clear low voice, steady but full"
573,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"of suppressed anguish.  A shriek was heard among the women, and"
574,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Sidonius stepped forth and demanded the amount of wehrgeld.
575,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
576,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""That must be for King Euric to decide,"" returned Meinhard.  ""He"
577,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"will fix the amount, and it will be for Odo to choose whether he"
578,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"will accept it.  The mulct will be high, for the youth was of high"
579,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Baltic blood, and had but lately arrived with his father from the"
580,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"north!"""
581,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
582,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Enough,"" said Verronax.  ""Listen, Meinhard.  Thou knowest me, and"
583,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,the Arvernian faith.  Leave me this night to make my peace with
584,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Heaven and my parting with man.  At the hour of six to-morrow
585,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"morning, I swear that I will surrender myself into thine hands to be"
586,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"dealt with as it may please the father of this young man."""
587,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
588,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""So let it be, Meinhard,"" said AEmilius, in a stifled voice."
589,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
590,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""I know AEmilius, and I know Verronax,"" returned the Goth."
591,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
592,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"They grasped hands, and then Meinhard drew off his followers,"
593,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"leaving two, at the request of Marcus, to act as sentinels at the"
594,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,gate.
595,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
596,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,The Senator sat with his hands clasped over his face in unutterable
597,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"grief, Columba threw herself into the arms of her betrothed, Marina"
598,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"tore her hair, and shrieked out--"
599,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
600,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""I will not hold my peace!  It is cruel!  It is wicked!  It is"
601,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"barbarous!"""
602,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
603,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Silence, Marina,"" said Verronax.  ""It is just!  I am no ignorant"
604,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"child.  I knew the penalty when I incurred it!  My Columba,"
605,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"remember, though it was a hasty blow, it was in defence of our"
606,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Master's Name."""
607,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
608,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,The thought might comfort her by and by; as yet it could not.
609,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
610,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,The Senator rose and took his hand.
611,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
612,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Thou dost forgive me, my son?"" he said."
613,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
614,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""I should find it hard to forgive one who lessened my respect for"
615,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the AEmilian constancy,"" returned Verronax."
616,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
617,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Then he led Marcus aside to make arrangements with him respecting
618,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"his small mountain estate and the remnant of his tribe, since Marina"
619,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"was his nearest relative, and her little son would, if he were cut"
620,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"off, be the sole heir to the ancestral glories of Vercingetorix."
621,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
622,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""And I cannot stir to save such a youth as that!"" cried the Senator"
623,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"in a tone of agony as he wrung the hand of Sidonius.  ""I have bound"
624,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"mine own hands, when I would sell all I have to save him.  O my"
625,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"friend and father, well mightest thou blame my rashness, and doubt"
626,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the justice that could be stern where the heart was not touched."""
627,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
628,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""But I am not bound by thine oath, my friend,"" said Sidonius.  ""True"
629,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"it is that the Master would not be served by the temporal sword, yet"
630,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,such zeal as that of this youth merits that we should strive to
631,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,deliver him.  Utmost justice would here be utmost wrong.  May I send
632,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,one of your slaves as a messenger to my son to see what he can
633,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,raise?  Though I fear me gold and silver is more scarce than it was
634,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"in our younger days."""
635,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
636,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"This was done, and young Lucius also took a summons from the Bishop"
637,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"to the deacons of the Church in the town, authorising the use of the"
638,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"sacred vessels to raise the ransom, but almost all of these had been"
639,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,already parted with in the time of a terrible famine which had
640,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"ravaged Arvernia a few years previously, and had denuded all the"
641,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,wealthy and charitable families of their plate and jewels.  Indeed
642,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Verronax shrank from the treasure of the Church being thus applied.
643,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Columba might indeed weep for him exultingly as a martyr, but, as he"
644,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"well knew, martyrs do not begin as murderers, and passion,"
645,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"pugnacity, and national hatred had been uppermost with him.  It was"
646,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the hap of war, and he was ready to take it patiently, and prepare"
647,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"himself for death as a brave Christian man, but not a hero or a"
648,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,martyr; and there was little hope either that a ransom so
649,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,considerable as the rank of the parties would require could be
650,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"raised without the aid of the AEmilii, or that, even if it were, the"
651,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"fierce old father would accept it.  The more civilised Goths, whose"
652,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"families had ranged Italy, Spain, and Aquitaine for two or three"
653,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"generations, made murder the matter of bargain that had shocked"
654,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,AEmilius; but this was an old man from the mountain cradle of the
655,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"race, unsophisticated, and but lately converted."
656,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
657,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,In the dawn of the summer morning Bishop Sidonius celebrated the
658,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Holy Eucharist for the mournful family in the oratory, a vaulted"
659,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"chamber underground, which had served the same purpose in the days"
660,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"of persecution, and had the ashes of two tortured martyrs of the"
661,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"AEmilian household, mistress and slave, enshrined together beneath"
662,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the altar, which had since been richly inlaid with coloured marble."
663,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
664,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Afterwards a morning meal was served for Verronax and for the elder
665,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"AEmilius, who intended to accompany him on his sad journey to"
666,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Bordigala, where the King and the father of Odorik were known to be"
667,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"at the time.  Sidonius, who knew himself to have some interest with"
668,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Euric, would fain have gone with them, but his broken health"
669,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"rendered a rapid journey impossible, and he hoped to serve the"
670,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"friends better by remaining to console the two women, and to"
671,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,endeavour to collect the wehrgeld in case it should be accepted.
672,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
673,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"The farewells, owing to the Roman dignity of AEmilius and the proud"
674,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"self-respect of the Arvernian, were more calm than had been feared."
675,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Even thus, thought Sidonius, must Vercingetorix have looked when he"
676,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,mounted his horse and rode from his lines at Alesia to save his
677,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"people, by swelling Caesar's triumph and dying beneath the Capitol."
678,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Oh, ABSIT OMEN!  Columba was borne up by hopes which Verronax would"
679,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"not dash to the ground, and she received his embrace with steadfast,"
680,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"though brimming eyes, and an assurance that she would pray without"
681,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,ceasing.
682,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
683,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Lucius was not to be found, having no doubt gone forward, intending"
684,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"to direct his friend on his journey, and there part with him; but"
685,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,the saddest part of the whole was the passionate wailings and
686,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,bemoanings of the remnants of his clan.  One of his attendants had
687,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,carried the tidings; wild Keltic men and women had come down for one
688,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"last sight of their Fearnagh MacFearccadorigh, as they called him by"
689,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,his true Gaulish name--passionately kissing his hands and the hem of

691,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"throwing themselves in his path, as, with the high spirit which"
692,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"could not brook to be fetched as a criminal, he made his way to the"

694,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
695,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Mounted on two strong mules, the only animals serviceable in the"

714,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
715,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"So on they moved, the wildly-clad, barefooted Gauls, with locks"

717,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"long, low farm-buildings belonging to Deodatus, a half-bred Roman"
718,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Gaul, with a large vineyard and numerous herds of cattle.  The place"
719,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,was wonderfully quiet.  The Goths seemed to be indulging in very
720,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"sound slumbers after their carouse, for nothing was to be seen but"
721,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,the slaves coming in with bowls of milk from the cattle.  Some of

723,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Deodatus came to his door with the salutation, ""AVE CLARISSIME!"" and"

738,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
739,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,The excitable household was on the point of breaking out into

744,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,

746,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"while he was speaking, a messenger came up and put into his hand one"

749,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
750,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"L. AEM.  VIC. TO M. AEM. VIC.  S. Q.,--Pardon and bless thy son."

755,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
756,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
757,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,The little tablet could hold no more than this--almost every word

759,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""My brave son.  Thus does he redeem his father's rash oath!"""
760,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
761,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Verronax, whose Roman breeding had held his impulsive Keltic nature"

768,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
769,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"It would have been impossible to withhold him, and Marcus returned"
770,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"with the strange tidings, while his father and Verronax set forth"
771,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"with a few servants, mounted like themselves on mules, to reach the"
772,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"broad Roman road that led from Gergovia to Bordigala.  Three wild,"
773,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,barefooted Gauls of Verronax's clan shook their heads at all his
774,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"attempts to send them home, and went running along after him with"
775,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the same fidelity as poor Celer, whom he had left tied up at the"
776,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"villa as his parting gift to little Victorinus, but who had broken"
777,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"loose, and came bounding to his master, caressing him with nose and"
778,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,tongue at their first halt.
779,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
780,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"There had been, as in all Roman roads, regular posting stations at"
781,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"intervals along the way, where horses and mules could be hired, but"
782,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the troubles of the Empire, invasion, and scarcity had greatly"
783,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"disturbed the system.  Many of the stations were deserted, and at"
784,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"others either the whole of the animals, or all the fleeter ones, had"
785,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,been taken up by Meinhard and his convoy.  Indeed it almost seemed
786,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"that not only Lucius was anxious not to be overtaken, but that"
787,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Meinhard was forwarding his endeavours to consummate his sacrifice
788,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,before the Arvernian could prevent it.
789,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
790,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Hotly did Verronax chafe at each hindrance.  He would have dashed
791,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"onwards with feverish head-long speed, using his own fleet limbs"
792,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"when he could not obtain a horse, but AEmilius feared to trust him"
793,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"alone, lest, coming too late to rescue Lucius, he should bring on"
794,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"himself the fury of the Goths, strike perhaps in revenge, and not"
795,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"only lose his own life and render the sacrifice vain, but imperil"
796,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,many more.
797,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
798,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"So, while making all possible speed, he bound the young Arvernian,"
799,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"by all the ties of paternal guardianship and authority, to give his"
800,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,word not to use his lighter weight and youthful vigour to outstrip
801,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,the rest of the party.
802,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
803,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"The Senator himself hardly knew what was his own wish, for if his"
804,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"fatherly affection yearned over his gentle, dutiful, studious"
805,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Lucius, yet Columba's desolation, and the importance of Verronax as"
806,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"a protector for his family, so weighed down the other scale, that he"
807,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,could only take refuge in 'committing his way unto the Lord.'
808,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
809,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"The last halting-place was at a villa belonging to a Roman, where"
810,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,they heard that an assembly was being held in the fields near
811,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Bordigala for judgment on the slaughter of a young Goth of high
812,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"rank.  On learning how deeply they were concerned, their host lent"
813,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"them two horses, and rode with them himself, as they hastened on in"
814,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,speechless anxiety.
815,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
816,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,These early Teutonic nations all had their solemn assemblies in the
817,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"open air, and the Goths had not yet abandoned the custom, so that as"
818,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,the Senator and the chieftain turned the summit of the last low hill
819,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,they could see the plain beneath swarming like an ant-hill with
820,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"people, and as they pressed onward they could see a glittering tent,"
821,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"woven with cloth of gold, a throne erected in front, and around it a"
822,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"space cleared and guarded by a huge circle of warriors (LITES),"
823,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,whose shields joined so as to form a wall.
824,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
825,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Near the throne stood the men of higher degree, all alike to join"
826,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the King in his judgment, like the Homeric warriors of old, as"
827,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,indeed Sidonius had often said that there was no better comment on
828,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,the ILIAD than the meetings of the barbarians.
829,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
830,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"By the time AEmilius and Verronax had reached the spot, and gained"
831,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"an entrance in virtue of their rank and concern in the matter, Euric"
832,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,sat enthroned in the midst of the assembly.  He was far removed from
833,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"being a savage, though he had won his crown by the murder of his"
834,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,brother.  He and the counts (comrades) around him wore the Roman
835,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"garb, and used by preference the Latin speech, learning, arms, and"
836,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"habits, just as European civilisation is adopted by the Egyptian or"
837,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Japanese of the present day.  He understood Roman jurisprudence, and"
838,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"was the author of a code for the Goths, but in a case like this he"
839,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,was obliged to conform to national customs.
840,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
841,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"There he sat, a small, light-complexioned man, of slighter make than"
842,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"those around him, holding in his hand a scroll.  It was a letter"
843,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"from Sidonius, sent beforehand by a swift-footed mountaineer, and"
844,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"containing a guarantee for 1200 soldi, twice the price for a Goth of"
845,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"ordinary rank.  On the one side stood, unbound and unguarded, the"
846,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"slender form of Lucius; on the other a gigantic old Visigoth, blind,"
847,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"and with long streaming snowy hair and beard, his face stern with"
848,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"grief and passion, and both his knotted hands crossed upon the"
849,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,handle of a mighty battle-axe.
850,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
851,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,The King had evidently been explaining to him the terms of the
852,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Bishop's letter, for the first words that met the ear of AEmilius"
853,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,were--
854,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
855,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Nay, I say nay, King Euric.  Were I to receive treble the weight of"
856,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"gold, how should that enable me to face my son in the halls of Odin,"
857,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"with his blood unavenged?"""
858,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
859,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"There was a murmur, and the King exclaimed--"
860,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
861,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Now, now, Odo, we know no more of Odin."""
862,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
863,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Odin knows us no more,"" retorted the old man, ""since we have washed"
864,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"ourselves in the Name of another than the mighty Thor, and taken up"
865,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,the weakly worship of the conquered.  So my son would have it!  He
866,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,talked of a new Valhal of the Christian; but let him meet me where
867,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"he will, he shall not reproach me that he only of all his brethren"
868,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,died unavenged.  Where is the slayer?  Set him before me that I may
869,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"strike him dead with one blow!"""
870,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
871,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Lucius crossed himself, looked upwards, and was stepping forwards,"
872,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"when Verronax with a shout of 'Hold!' leapt into the midst, full"
873,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"before the avenger's uplifted weapon, crying--"
874,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
875,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Slay me, old man!  It was I who killed thy son, I, Fearnagh the"
876,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Arvernian!"""
877,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
878,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Ho!"" said Odo.  ""Give me thine hand.  Let me feel thee.  Yea, these"
879,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,be sinews!  It is well.  I marvelled how my Odorik should have
880,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,fallen by the soft Roman hand of yonder stripling; but thou art a
881,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,worthy foe.  What made the priestling thrust himself between me and
882,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"my prey?"""
883,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
884,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""His generous love,"" returned Verronax, as Lucius flung himself on"
885,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"his neck, crying--"
886,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
887,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""O my Verronax, why hast thou come?  The bitterness of death was"
888,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"past!  The gates were opening."""
889,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
890,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Meanwhile AEmilius had reached Euric, and had made him understand"
891,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the substitution.  Old Odo knew no Latin, and it was the King, an"
892,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"able orator in both tongues, who expounded all in Gothic, showing"
893,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"how Lucius AEmilius had offered his life in the stead of his friend,"
894,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"and how Verronax had hurried to prevent the sacrifice, reiterating,"
895,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"almost in a tone of command, the alternative of the wehrgeld."
896,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
897,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,The lites all burst into acclamations at the nobility of the two
898,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"young men, and some muttered that they had not thought these Romans"
899,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,had so much spirit.
900,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
901,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Euric made no decision.  He did full justice to the courage and
902,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"friendship of the youths, and likewise to the fact that Odorik had"
903,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"provoked the quarrel, and had been slain in fair fight; but the"
904,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"choice lay with the father, and perhaps in his heart the politic"
905,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Visigoth could not regret that Arvernia should lose a champion sure
906,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,to stand up for Roman or national claims.
907,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
908,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Odo listened in silence, leaning on his axe.  Then he turned his"
909,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"face to the bystanders, and demanded of them--"
910,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
911,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Which of them is the bolder?  Which of them flinched at my axe?"""
912,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
913,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,The spectators were unanimous that neither had blenched.  The
914,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,slender lad had presented himself as resolutely as the stately
915,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,warrior.
916,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
917,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""It is well,"" said Odo.  ""Either way my son will be worthily"
918,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"avenged.  I leave the choice to you, young men."""
919,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
920,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"A brief debate ended in an appeal to the Senator, who, in spite of"
921,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"all his fortitude, could not restrain himself from groaning aloud,"
922,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"hiding his face in his hands, and hoarsely saying, ""Draw lots."""
923,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
924,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Yes,"" said Euric; ""commit the judgment to Heaven."""
925,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
926,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,It was hailed as a relief; but Lucius stipulated that the lots
927,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"should be blessed by a Catholic priest, and Verronax muttered"
928,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,impatiently--
929,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
930,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""What matters it?  Let us make an end as quickly as may be!"""
931,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
932,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"He had scarcely spoken when shouts were heard, the throng made way,"
933,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the circle of lites opened, as, waving an olive branch, a wearied,"
934,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"exhausted rider and horse appeared, and staggering to the foot of"
935,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the throne, there went down entirely spent, the words being just"
936,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"audible, ""He lives!  Odorik lives!"""
937,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
938,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"It was Marcus AEmilius, covered with dust, and at first unable to"

940,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"brother, while his father made haste to administer the wine handed"
941,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,to him by an attendant.
942,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
943,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Am I in time?"" he asked."
944,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
945,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""In time, my son,"" replied his father, repeating his announcement in"
946,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Gothic.  ""Odorik lives!"""
947,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
948,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""He lives, he will live,"" repeated Marcus, reviving.  ""I came not"

950,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
951,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Is it truth?"" demanded the old Goth.  ""Romans have slippery ways."""
952,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
953,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Meinhard was quick to bear testimony that no man in Arvernia doubted
954,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the word of an AEmilius; but Marcus, taking a small dagger from his"
955,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"belt, held it out, saying--"
956,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
957,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""His son said that he would know this token."""
958,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,

964,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
965,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Marcus had gathered breath and memory to add, ""Tell him Odorik said"

968,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
969,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""I own the token,"" said Odo.  ""My son lives.  He needs no"
970,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"vengeance.""  He turned the handle of his axe downwards, passed it to"
971,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"his left hand, and stretched the right to Verronax, saying, ""Young"
972,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"man, thou art brave.  There is no blood feud between us.  Odo, son"
973,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"of Helgund, would swear friendship with you, though ye be Romans."""
974,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
975,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Compensation is still due according to the amount of the injury,"""
976,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"said the Senator scrupulously.  ""Is it not so, O King?"""
977,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
978,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Euric assented, but Odo exclaimed--"
979,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
980,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""No gold for me!  When Odo, son of Helgund, forgives, he forgives"
981,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"outright.  Where is my son?"""
982,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
983,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Food had by this time been brought by the King's order, and after"
984,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,swallowing a few mouthfuls Marcus could stand and speak.
985,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
986,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Odorik, apparently dead, had been dragged by the Goths into the hut"
987,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,of the widow Dubhina to await his father's decision as to the
988,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"burial, and the poor woman had been sheltered by her neighbour,"
989,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Julitta, leaving the hovel deserted."
990,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
991,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Columba, not allowing her grief and suspense to interfere with her"
992,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"visits of mercy to the poor woman, had come down as usual on the"
993,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,evening of the day on which her father and her betrothed had started
994,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"on their sad journey.  Groans, not likely to be emitted by her"
995,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"regular patient, had startled her, and she had found the floor"
996,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"occupied by the huge figure of a young Goth, his face and hair"
997,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"covered with blood from a deep wound on his head, insensible, but"
998,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,his moans and the motion of his limbs betraying life.
999,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1000,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Knowing the bitter hatred in Claudiodunum for everything Gothic, the"
1001,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,brave girl would not seek for aid nearer than the villa.  Thither
1002,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"she despatched her male slave, while with her old nurse she did all"
1003,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"in her power for the relief of the wounded man, with no"
1004,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,inconsiderable skill.  Marcus had brought the Greek physician of the
1005,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"place, but he had done nothing but declare the patient a dead man by"
1006,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"all the laws of Galen and Hippocrates.  However, the skull and"
1007,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"constitution of a vigorous young Goth, fresh from the mountains,"
1008,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,were tougher than could be imagined by a member of one of the
1009,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,exhausted races of the Levant.  Bishop Sidonius had brought his
1010,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"science and sagacity to the rescue, and under his treatment Odorik"
1011,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"had been restored to his senses, and was on the fair way to"
1012,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,recovery.
1013,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1014,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"On the first gleam of hope, Marcus had sent off a messenger, but so"
1015,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,many of his household and dependents were absent that he had no
1016,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"great choice; so that as soon as hope had become security, he had"
1017,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"set forth himself; and it was well he had done so, for he had"
1018,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,overtaken the messenger at what was reckoned as three days' journey
1019,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"from Bordigala.  He had ridden ever since without rest, only"
1020,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"dismounting to change his steed, scarcely snatching even then a"
1021,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"morsel of food, and that morning neither he nor the horse he rode"
1022,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,had relaxed for a moment the desperate speed with which he rode
1023,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,against time; so that he had no cause for the shame and vexation
1024,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,that he felt at his utter collapse before the barbarians.  King
1025,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Euric himself declared that he wished he had a Goth who could
1026,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,perform such a feat of endurance.
1027,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1028,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"While Marcus slept, AEmilius and the two young men offered their"
1029,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"heartfelt thanks in the Catholic church of Bordigala, and then Euric"
1030,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,would not be refused their presence at a great feast of
1031,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"reconciliation on the following day, two of Verronax's speedy-footed"
1032,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,followers having been sent off at once to bear home tidings that his
1033,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,intelligence had been in time.
1034,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1035,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"The feast was served in the old proconsular house, with the Roman"

1037,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,to be found at an English dinner-party in the abode of an Indian
1038,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Rajah.  It began with Roman etiquette, but ended in a Gothic revel,"

1040,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1041,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"They were to set off on their return early on the morrow, Meinhard"

1049,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Old Odo disdained a mule, and would let no hand save his own guide"
1050,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"his horse.  Verronax and Lucius constituted themselves his guides,"
1051,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"and whenever he permitted the slightest assistance, it was always"
1052,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"from the Arvernian, whom he seemed to regard as a sort of adopted"
1053,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,son.
1054,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1055,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"He felt over his weapons, and told him long stories, of which"
1056,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Verronax understood only a word or two here and there, though the"
1057,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,old man seemed little concerned thereat.  Now and then he rode along
1058,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"chanting to himself an extemporary song, which ran somewhat thus--"
1059,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1060,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1061,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Maids who choose the slain,"
1062,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Disappointed now.

1068,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Shall the soft priestling
1069,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Step before him to Valhal,"
1070,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Cheating Lok's daughter
1071,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Of weak-hearted prey?
1072,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Lo! the Wolf wakens.
1073,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Valkyr relaxes,"
1074,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Waits for a battlefield,"
1075,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Wolf-cub to claim.
1076,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Friendly the Falcon,"
1077,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,Friendly the Gray-Wolf.
1078,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1079,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1080,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"So it ran on, to the great scandal of Lucius, who longed for better"
1081,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,knowledge of the Gothic tongue to convince the old man of the folly
1082,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"of his heathen dreams.  Meinhard, who was likewise rather shocked,"
1083,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"explained that the father and son had been recent arrivals, who had"
1084,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,been baptized because Euric required his followers to embrace his
1085,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"faith, but with little real knowledge or acceptance on the part of"
1086,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"the father.  Young Odorik had been a far more ardent convert; and,"
1087,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"after the fashion of many a believer, had taken up the distinctions"
1088,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"of sect rather than of religion, and, zealous in the faith he knew,"
1089,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,had thought it incumbent on him to insult the Catholics where they
1090,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,seemed to him idolatrous.
1091,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1092,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,A message on the road informed the travellers that they would find
1093,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Odorik at the villa.  Thither then they went, and soon saw the whole"
1094,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"household on the steps in eager anticipation.  A tall young figure,"
1095,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"with a bandage still round his fair flowing locks, came down the"
1096,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"steps as Verronax helped the blind man to dismount; and Odo, with a"
1097,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"cry of 'My son!' with a ring of ecstasy in the sound, held the youth"
1098,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,to his breast and felt him all over.
1099,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1100,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Are we friends?"" said Odorik, turning to Verronax, when his father"
1101,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,released him.
1102,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1103,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""That is as thou wiliest,"" returned the Arvernian gravely."
1104,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1105,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Know then,"" said Odorik, ""that I know that I erred.  I knew not thy"
1106,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Lord when I mocked thine honour to Him.  Father, we had but half"
1107,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,learnt the Christian's God.  I have seen it now.  It was not thy
1108,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"blow, O Arvernian! that taught me; but the Master who inspired"
1109,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"yonder youth to offer his life, and who sent the maiden there to"
1110,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,wait upon her foe.  He is more than man.  I own in him the Eternal
1111,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"Creator, Redeemer, and Lord!"""
1112,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,
1113,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"""Yea,"" said Sidonius to his friend AEmilius, ""a great work hath been"
1114,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,wrought out.  Thus hath the parable of actual life led this zealous
1115,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,but half-taught youth to enter into the higher truth.  Lucius will
1116,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,be none the worse priest for having trodden in the steps of Him who
1117,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,"was High-priest and Victim.  Who may abide strict Divine Justice,"
1118,THE PRICE OF BLOOD,had not One stood between the sinner and the Judge?  Thus 'Mercy and

1226,V,"'Mid flashing sword, and axe, and flame,"

1239,V,"Time keeping with retracted claw,"
1240,V,Or patting with her velvet paw;
1241,V,"Although of home and friends bereft,"
1242,V,"Still this one comforter was left,"
1243,V,"So lithe, so swift, so soft, so white,"
1244,V,She might have seemed his guardian sprite.
1245,V,The rude Danes deemed her such;

1261,VI,"Fell on the coast; and far or near,"
1262,VI,"No voice caught Edric's wakeful ear,"
1263,VI,Save water's lapping sound.
1264,VI,"He wandered from the stern to prow,"
1265,VI,"Ate of the stores, and marvelled how"
1266,VI,He yet might reach the ground;
1267,VI,"Till low and lower sank the tide,"
1268,VI,Dark banks of mud spread far and wide
1269,VI,Around that fast-bound wreck.
1270,VI,"Then the lone boy climbed down the ship,"
1271,VI,"To cross the mud by bound and skip,"
1272,VI,His cat upon his neck.
1273,VI,"Light was his weight and swift his leap,"
1274,VI,"Now would he softly tread, now creep,"
1275,VI,"For treacherous was the mud, and deep"
1276,VI,"From stone to weed, from weed to plank,"
1277,VI,Leaving a hole where'er he sank;
1278,VI,With panting breath and sore taxed strength
1279,VI,The solid earth he felt at length.
1280,VI,"Sheltered within the copse he lay,"
1281,VI,"When dawn had brightened into day,"
1282,VI,"For when one moment there was seen,"
1283,VI,"His red cap glancing 'mid the green,"
1284,VI,A fearful cry arose--
1285,VI,"""Here lurks a Dane!""  ""The Dane seek out"""
1286,VI,"With knife and axe, the rabble rout"
1287,VI,Made the copse ring with yell and shout
1288,VI,To find their dreaded foes.
1289,VI,"And Edric feared to meet a stroke,"
1290,VI,Before they knew the tongue he spoke.
1291,VI,"Hid 'mid the branches of an oak,"
1292,VI,He heard their calls and blows.
1293,VI,"Of food he had a simple store,"
1294,VI,"And when the churls the chase gave o'er,"
1295,VI,"And evening sunk upon the vale,"
1296,VI,"With rubbing head and upright tail,"
1297,VI,"Pacing before him to and fro,"
1298,VI,Puss lured him on the way to go--
1299,VI,"Coaxing him on, with tender wile,"
1300,VI,O'er heath and down for many a mile.
1301,VI,Ask me not how her course she knows.
1302,VI,He from Whom every instinct flows
1303,VI,"Hath breathed into His creatures power,"
1304,VI,Giving to each its needful dower;
1305,VI,"And strive and question as we will,"
1306,VI,"We cannot trace the inborn skill,"
1307,VI,"Nor fathom how, where'er she roam,"
1308,VI,The cat ne'er fails to find her home.

1310,VII,VII
1311,VII,
1312,VII,"What pen may dare to paint the woe,"
1313,VII,When Egbert saw his home laid low?
1314,VII,"Where, by the desolated hearth,"
1315,VII,"The mother lay who gave him birth,"
1316,VII,"And, close beside, his fair young wife,"
1317,VII,"And servants, slain in bootless strife--"
1318,VII,Mournful the King stood near.
1319,VII,"Alfred, who came to be his guest,"
1320,VII,And deeply rued that his behest
1321,VII,"Had all unguarded left that nest,"
1322,VII,To meet such ruin drear.
1323,VII,"With hand, and heart, and lip, he gave"
1324,VII,"All king or friend, both true and brave,"
1325,VII,"Could give, one pang of grief to save,"
1326,VII,"To comfort, or to cheer--"
1327,VII,As from the blackened walls they drew
1328,VII,"Each corpse, and laid with reverence due;"
1329,VII,And then it was that Egbert knew
1330,VII,All save the child were here.
1331,VII,"King Alfred's noble head was bent,"
1332,VII,A monarch's pain his bosom rent;

1339,VII,"Safe, where the weary are at rest;"
1340,VII,"Safe, where the banish'd and opprest"

1345,VII,"And for the slain, from monk and priest"
1346,VII,"Rose requiems that never ceased,"
1347,VII,While still he sought his son.
1348,VII,"""Oh, would to Heaven!"" that father said,"
1349,VII,"""There lay my darling calmly dead,"

1363,VIII,"Hanging around his home once more,"
1364,VIII,Feeding his bitter pain.
1365,VIII,The King would fain with friendly force
1366,VIII,"Urge him anew to mount his horse,"
1367,VIII,"Turn from the piteous sight away,"
1368,VIII,"And fresh begin life's saddened day,"
1369,VIII,"His loved ones looking yet to greet,"
1370,VIII,Where ne'er shall part the blest who meet.
1371,VIII,"Just then a voice that well he knew,"
1372,VIII,"A sound that mixed the purr and mew,"
1373,VIII,Went to the father's heart.
1374,VIII,On a large stone King Alfred sat
1375,VIII,"Against his buskin rubbed a cat,"
1376,VIII,"Snow-white in every part,"
1377,VIII,Though drenched and soiled from head to tail.
1378,VIII,The poor Thane's tears poured down like hail--
1379,VIII,"""Poor puss, in vain thy loving wail,"""
1380,VIII,Then came a joyful start!
1381,VIII,A little hand was on his cloak--
1382,VIII,"""Father!"" a voice beside him spoke,"
1383,VIII,Emerging from the wood.
1384,VIII,"All travel-stained, and marked with mire,"
1385,VIII,"With trace of blood, and toil, and fire,"
1386,VIII,"Yet safe and sound beside his sire,"
1387,VIII,Edric before them stood.
1388,VIII,"And as his father wept for joy,"
1389,VIII,"King Alfred blessed the rescued boy,"
1390,VIII,And thanked his Maker good!
1391,VIII,"Who doth the captive's prayer fulfil,"
1392,VIII,Making His creatures work His will

1458,I.  DE FACTO,
1459,I.  DE FACTO,"'I say,' returned a black, bronzed hunter, pressing to the front,"
1460,I.  DE FACTO,"'that what I hold of thee, King William, on tenure of homage, and of"
1461,I.  DE FACTO,"two good horses and staunch hounds yearly, I yield to no English"
1462,I.  DE FACTO,"mongrel churl, who dares to meddle with me.'"
1463,I.  DE FACTO,
1464,I.  DE FACTO,"'Thou hear'st, lad,' said Rufus, with his accustomed oath, 'homage"
1465,I.  DE FACTO,"hath been done to us for the land, nor may it be taken back.  Out of"
1466,I.  DE FACTO,"our way, or--'"
1467,I.  DE FACTO,
1468,I.  DE FACTO,"'Sir! sir!' entreated the lad, grasping the bridle, 'if no more"
1469,I.  DE FACTO,"might be, we would be content if Sir Roger would but leave my mother"
1470,I.  DE FACTO,"enough for her maintenance among the nuns of Romsey, and give me a"
1471,I.  DE FACTO,horse and suit of mail to go on the Holy War with Duke Robert.'
1472,I.  DE FACTO,
1473,I.  DE FACTO,'Ho! ho! a modest request for a beggarly English clown!' cried the
1474,I.  DE FACTO,"King, aiming a blow at the lad with his whip, and pushing on his"
1475,I.  DE FACTO,"horse, so as almost to throw him back on the heath.  'Ho! ho! fit"
1476,I.  DE FACTO,him out for a fool's errand!'
1477,I.  DE FACTO,
1478,I.  DE FACTO,'We'll fit him!  We'll teach him to take the cross at other men's
1479,I.  DE FACTO,"expense!' shouted the followers, seizing on the boy."
1480,I.  DE FACTO,
1481,I.  DE FACTO,'Nay; we'll bestow his cross on him for a free gift!' exclaimed
1482,I.  DE FACTO,Roger de Maisonforte.
1483,I.  DE FACTO,
1484,I.  DE FACTO,"And Bertram, struggling desperately in vain among the band of"
1485,I.  DE FACTO,"ruffians, found his left arm bared, and two long and painful"
1486,I.  DE FACTO,"slashes, in the form of the Crusader's cross, inflicted, amid loud"
1487,I.  DE FACTO,"laughter, as the blood sprang forth."
1488,I.  DE FACTO,
1489,I.  DE FACTO,"'There, Sir Crusader,' said Roger, grinding his teeth over him.  'Go"
1490,I.  DE FACTO,"on thy way now--as a horse-boy, if so please thee, and know better"
1491,I.  DE FACTO,than to throw thy mean false English pretension in the face of a
1492,I.  DE FACTO,gentle Norman.'
1493,I.  DE FACTO,
1494,I.  DE FACTO,"Men, horses, dogs, all seemed to trample and scoff at Bertram as he"
1495,I.  DE FACTO,"fell back on the elastic stems of the heath and gorse, whose"
1496,I.  DE FACTO,prickles seemed to renew the insults by scratching his face.  When
1497,I.  DE FACTO,"the King's horn, the calls, the brutal laughter, and the baying of"
1498,I.  DE FACTO,"the dogs had begun to die away in the distance, he gathered himself"
1499,I.  DE FACTO,"together, sat up, and tried to find some means of stanching the"
1500,I.  DE FACTO,"blood.  Not only was the wound in a place hard to reach, but it had"
1501,I.  DE FACTO,"been ploughed with the point of a boar-spear, and was grievously"
1502,I.  DE FACTO,"torn.  He could do nothing with it, and, as he perceived, he had"
1503,I.  DE FACTO,"further been robbed of his sword, his last possession, his father's"
1504,I.  DE FACTO,sword.
1505,I.  DE FACTO,
1506,I.  DE FACTO,"The large tears of mingled rage, grief, and pain might well spring"
1507,I.  DE FACTO,"from the poor boy's eyes in his utter loneliness, as he clenched his"
1508,I.  DE FACTO,"hand with powerless wrath, and regained his feet, to retrace, as"
1509,I.  DE FACTO,"best he might, his way to where his widowed mother had found a"
1510,I.  DE FACTO,temporary shelter in a small religious house.
1511,I.  DE FACTO,
1512,I.  DE FACTO,"The sun grew hotter and hotter, Bertram's wound bled, though not"
1513,I.  DE FACTO,"profusely, the smart grew upon him, his tongue was parched with"
1514,I.  DE FACTO,"thirst, and though he kept resolutely on, his breath came panting,"
1515,I.  DE FACTO,"his head grew dizzy, his eyes dim, his feet faltered, and at last,"
1516,I.  DE FACTO,"just as he attained a wider and more trodden way, he dropped"
1517,I.  DE FACTO,"insensible by the side of the path, his dry lips trying to utter the"
1518,I.  DE FACTO,"cry, ""Lord, have mercy on me!"""

1523,II.  DE JURE,
1524,II.  DE JURE,When Bertram de Maisonforte opened his eyes again cold waters were
1525,II.  DE JURE,"on his face, wine was moistening his lips, the burning of his wound"
1526,II.  DE JURE,"was assuaged by cooling oil, while a bandage was being applied, and"
1527,II.  DE JURE,"he was supported on a breast and in arms, clad indeed in a hauberk,"
1528,II.  DE JURE,"but as tenderly kind as the full deep voice that spoke in English,"
1529,II.  DE JURE,"""He comes round.  How now, my child?"""
1530,II.  DE JURE,
1531,II.  DE JURE,"""Father,"" murmured Bertram, with dreamy senses."
1532,II.  DE JURE,
1533,II.  DE JURE,"""Better now; another sup from the flask, David,"" again said the kind"
1534,II.  DE JURE,"voice, and looking up, he became aware of the beautiful benignant"
1535,II.  DE JURE,"face, deep blue eyes, and long light locks of the man in early"
1536,II.  DE JURE,"middle age who had laid him on his knee, while a priest was binding"
1537,II.  DE JURE,"his arm, and a fair and graceful boy, a little younger than himself,"
1538,II.  DE JURE,"was standing by with the flask of wine in his hand, and a face of"
1539,II.  DE JURE,"such girlish beauty that as he knelt to hold the wine to his lips,"
1540,II.  DE JURE,Bertram asked--
1541,II.  DE JURE,
1542,II.  DE JURE,"""Am I among the Angels?"""
1543,II.  DE JURE,
1544,II.  DE JURE,"""Not yet,"" said the elder man.  ""Art thou near thine home?"""
1545,II.  DE JURE,
1546,II.  DE JURE,"""Alack!  I have no home, kind sir,"" said Bertram, now able to raise"
1547,II.  DE JURE,himself and to perceive that he was in the midst of a small hand of
1548,II.  DE JURE,"armed men, such as every knight or noble necessarily carried about"
1549,II.  DE JURE,"with him for protection.  There was a standard with a dragon, and"
1550,II.  DE JURE,"their leader himself was armed, all save his head, and, as Bertram"
1551,II.  DE JURE,"saw, was a man of massive strength, noble stature, and kingly"
1552,II.  DE JURE,appearance.
1553,II.  DE JURE,
1554,II.  DE JURE,"""What shall we do for thee?"" he asked.  ""Who hath put thee in this"
1555,II.  DE JURE,"evil case?"""
1556,II.  DE JURE,
1557,II.  DE JURE,"Bertram gave his name, and at its Norman sound there was a start of"
1558,II.  DE JURE,"repulsion from the boy.  ""French after all!"" he exclaimed."
1559,II.  DE JURE,
1560,II.  DE JURE,"""Nay, David,"" said the leader, ""if I mind me rightly, the Lady"
1561,II.  DE JURE,Elftrud of Boyatt wedded a brave Norman of that name.  Art thou her
1562,II.  DE JURE,"son?  I see something of her face, and thou hast an English tongue."""
1563,II.  DE JURE,
1564,II.  DE JURE,"""I am; I am her only son!"" exclaimed Bertram; and as he told of his"
1565,II.  DE JURE,"wrongs and the usage he had met with, young David cried out with"
1566,II.  DE JURE,indignation--
1567,II.  DE JURE,
1568,II.  DE JURE,"""Uncle, uncle, how canst thou suffer that these things should be?"
1569,II.  DE JURE,Here are our faithful cnihts.  Let us ride to the forest.  Wherefore
1570,II.  DE JURE,should it not be with Red William and his ruffians as with Scottish
1571,II.  DE JURE,"Duncan and Donald?"""
1572,II.  DE JURE,
1573,II.  DE JURE,"""Hush thee, David, my nephew.  Thou knowest that may not be.  But"
1574,II.  DE JURE,"for thee, young Bertram, we will see what can be done.  Canst sit a"
1575,II.  DE JURE,"horse now?"""
1576,II.  DE JURE,
1577,II.  DE JURE,"""Yea, my lord, full well.  I know not what came over me, even now,"""
1578,II.  DE JURE,"said Bertram, much ashamed of the condition in which he had been"
1579,II.  DE JURE,found.
1580,II.  DE JURE,
1581,II.  DE JURE,"A sumpter horse was found for him, the leader of the party saying"
1582,II.  DE JURE,"that they would go on to his own home, where the youth's wound"
1583,II.  DE JURE,"should be looked to, and they could then decide what could be done"
1584,II.  DE JURE,for him.
1585,II.  DE JURE,
1586,II.  DE JURE,"Bertram was still so far faint, suffering, weak, and weary, that he"
1587,II.  DE JURE,"was hardly awake to curiosity as to his surroundings, and had quite"
1588,II.  DE JURE,"enough to do to keep his seat in the saddle, and follow in the wake"
1589,II.  DE JURE,"of the leader's tall white horse, above which shone his bright chain"
1590,II.  DE JURE,"mail and his still brighter golden locks, so that the exhausted boy"
1591,II.  DE JURE,began in some measure to feel as if he were following St. Michael on
1592,II.  DE JURE,his way to some better world.
1593,II.  DE JURE,
1594,II.  DE JURE,"Now and then the tall figure turned to see how it was with him, and"
1595,II.  DE JURE,"as he drooped more with fatigue and pain, bade one of the retainers"
1596,II.  DE JURE,keep beside him and support him.
1597,II.  DE JURE,
1598,II.  DE JURE,Thus at length the cavalcade left the heathery expanse and reached a
1599,II.  DE JURE,"valley, green with meadow-land and waving corn, with silvery beards"
1600,II.  DE JURE,"of barley rippling in the evening light, and cows and sheep being"
1601,II.  DE JURE,gathered for the night towards a dwelling where the river had been
1602,II.  DE JURE,trained to form a moat round low green ramparts enclosing a number
1603,II.  DE JURE,"of one-storied thatched houses and barns, with one round tower, a"
1604,II.  DE JURE,"strong embattled gateway, and at a little distance a square church"
1605,II.  DE JURE,"tower, and other cottages standing outside."
1606,II.  DE JURE,
1607,II.  DE JURE,A shout of ecstasy broke out from the village as the advancing party
1608,II.  DE JURE,"was seen and recognised.  Men, women, and children, rudely but"
1609,II.  DE JURE,"substantially clad, and many wearing the collar of the thrall, ran"
1610,II.  DE JURE,"out from their houses, baring their heads, bowing low, and each in"
1611,II.  DE JURE,turn receiving some kind word or nod of greeting from the lord whom
1612,II.  DE JURE,"they welcomed, while one after another of his armed followers turned"
1613,II.  DE JURE,"aside, and was absorbed into a happy family by wife or parent.  A"
1614,II.  DE JURE,"drawbridge crossed the moat, and there was a throng of joyful"
1615,II.  DE JURE,"servants in the archway--foremost a priest, stretching out his hands"
1616,II.  DE JURE,"in blessing, and a foreign-looking old woman, gray-haired and dark-"
1617,II.  DE JURE,"eyed, who gathered young David into her embrace as he sprang from"
1618,II.  DE JURE,"his horse, calling him her heart's darling and her sunshine, and"
1619,II.  DE JURE,"demanding, with a certain alarm, where were his brothers."
1620,II.  DE JURE,
1621,II.  DE JURE,"""In Scotland, dear Nurse Agnes--even where they should be,"" was"
1622,II.  DE JURE,"David's answer.  ""We are conquerors, do you see!  Edgar is a crowned"
1623,II.  DE JURE,"and anointed King--seated on the holy stone of Scone, and Alexander"

1625,II.  DE JURE,
1626,II.  DE JURE,"""It is even so, nurse,"" said the elder man, turning from the priest,"
1627,II.  DE JURE,"to whom he had more briefly spoken; ""God hath blessed our arms, and"
1628,II.  DE JURE,"young Edgar has his right.  God shield him in it!  And now, nurse,"

1637,III.  KING AT HOME,"past caring for anything but the relief of rest, cool drink, and the"
1638,III.  KING AT HOME,dressing of his wound; nor did he even ask where he was until he
1639,III.  KING AT HOME,"awoke in broad daylight the next morning, to the sound of church"
1640,III.  KING AT HOME,"bells, to the sight of a low but spacious chamber, with stone walls,"
1641,III.  KING AT HOME,"deerskins laid on the floor, and the old nurse standing by him with"
1642,III.  KING AT HOME,"a cup of refreshing drink, and ready to attend to his wound."
1643,III.  KING AT HOME,
1644,III.  KING AT HOME,"It was then that, feeling greatly refreshed, he ventured upon asking"

1647,III.  KING AT HOME,

1651,III.  KING AT HOME,"own?"""
1652,III.  KING AT HOME,
1653,III.  KING AT HOME,"Bertram was amazed, for he had only heard Normans speak of Edgar"
1654,III.  KING AT HOME,"Atheling, the heir of the ancient race, as a poor, tame-spirited,"
1655,III.  KING AT HOME,"wretched creature, unable to assert himself, and therefore left"
1656,III.  KING AT HOME,unmolested by the conquerors out of contempt.  He proceeded to ask
1657,III.  KING AT HOME,"what the journey was from which the Atheling was returning, and the"
1658,III.  KING AT HOME,"nurse, nothing loth, beguiled the tendance on his arm by explaining"
1659,III.  KING AT HOME,"how she had long ago travelled from Hungary with her charges, Edgar,"
1660,III.  KING AT HOME,"Margaret, and Christina; how it had come about that the crown, which"
1661,III.  KING AT HOME,"should have been her darling's, had been seized by the fierce duke"
1662,III.  KING AT HOME,"from beyond the sea; how Edgar, then a mere child, had been forced"
1663,III.  KING AT HOME,to swear oaths of fealty by which he held himself still bound; how
1664,III.  KING AT HOME,"her sweetest pearl of ladies, her jewel Margaret, had been wedded to"
1665,III.  KING AT HOME,"the rude wild King of Scots, and how her gentle sweetness and"
1666,III.  KING AT HOME,"holiness had tamed and softened him, so that she had been the"
1667,III.  KING AT HOME,blessing of his kingdom till he and his eldest son had fallen at
1668,III.  KING AT HOME,Alnwick while she lay a-dying; how the fierce savage Scots had risen
1669,III.  KING AT HOME,and driven forth her young children; and how their uncle the
1670,III.  KING AT HOME,"Atheling had ridden forth, taken them to his home, bred them in all"
1671,III.  KING AT HOME,"holiness and uprightness and good and knightly courage, and when"
1672,III.  KING AT HOME,"Edgar and Alexander, the two eldest, were full grown, had gone"
1673,III.  KING AT HOME,"northward with them once more, and had won back, in fair field, the"
1674,III.  KING AT HOME,throne of their father Malcolm.
1675,III.  KING AT HOME,
1676,III.  KING AT HOME,Truly there might well be rejoicing and triumph on the estate where
1677,III.  KING AT HOME,the Atheling ruled as a father and had been sorely missed.  He was
1678,III.  KING AT HOME,"at his early mass of thanksgiving at present, and Bertram was so"
1679,III.  KING AT HOME,much better that Nurse Agnes did not withstand his desire to rise
1680,III.  KING AT HOME,"and join the household and villagers, who were all collected in the"
1681,III.  KING AT HOME,"building, low and massive, but on which Edgar Atheling had lavished"
1682,III.  KING AT HOME,the rich ornamental work introduced by the Normans.  The round
1683,III.  KING AT HOME,"arched doorway was set in a succession of elaborate zigzags, birds'"
1684,III.  KING AT HOME,"heads, lions' faces, twists and knots; and within, the altar-"
1685,III.  KING AT HOME,hangings and the priest's robes were stiff with the exquisite and
1686,III.  KING AT HOME,elaborate embroidery for which the English nunneries were famed.
1687,III.  KING AT HOME,
1688,III.  KING AT HOME,"The whole building, with its low-browed roof, circular chancel arch"
1689,III.  KING AT HOME,"still more richly adorned, and stout short columns, was filled with"
1690,III.  KING AT HOME,"kneeling figures in rough homespun or sheepskin garments, and with"
1691,III.  KING AT HOME,"shaggy heads, above which towered the shining golden locks of the"
1692,III.  KING AT HOME,"Atheling, which were allowed to grow to a much greater length than"
1693,III.  KING AT HOME,"was the Norman fashion, and beside him was the still fairer head of"
1694,III.  KING AT HOME,"his young nephew, David of Scotland.  It was a thanksgiving service"
1695,III.  KING AT HOME,for their victory and safe return; and Bertram was just in time for
1696,III.  KING AT HOME,the TE DEUM that followed the mass.
1697,III.  KING AT HOME,
1698,III.  KING AT HOME,"The Atheling, after all was over, came forth, exchanging greetings"

1700,III.  KING AT HOME,"whom seemed to be equally delighted to see him back again, and whom"
1701,III.  KING AT HOME,"he bade to a feast in the hall, which would be prepared in the"
1702,III.  KING AT HOME,"course of the day.  Some, meantime, went to their homes near at"
1703,III.  KING AT HOME,"hand, others would amuse themselves with games at ball, archery,"
1704,III.  KING AT HOME,"singlestick, and the like, in an open space within the moat--where"
1705,III.  KING AT HOME,others fished.
1706,III.  KING AT HOME,
1707,III.  KING AT HOME,"Bertram was not neglected.  The Atheling inquired after his health,"
1708,III.  KING AT HOME,"heard his story in more detail, and after musing on it, said that"
1709,III.  KING AT HOME,"after setting affairs in order at home, he meant to visit his sister"
1710,III.  KING AT HOME,"and niece in the Abbey at Romsey, and would then make some"
1711,III.  KING AT HOME,arrangement for the Lady of Maisonforte; also he would endeavour to
1712,III.  KING AT HOME,"see the King on his return to Winchester, and endeavour to plead"
1713,III.  KING AT HOME,with him.
1714,III.  KING AT HOME,
1715,III.  KING AT HOME,"""William will at times hearken to an old comrade,"" he said; ""but it"

1719,III.  KING AT HOME,
1720,III.  KING AT HOME,Bertram was indeed stiff and weary enough to be quite content to lie
1721,III.  KING AT HOME,"on a bearskin in the wide hall of the dwelling, or under the eaves"
1722,III.  KING AT HOME,"without, and watch the doings with some amusement."
1723,III.  KING AT HOME,
1724,III.  KING AT HOME,He had been bred in some contempt of the Saxons.  His father's
1725,III.  KING AT HOME,"marriage had been viewed as a MESALLIANCE, and though the knight of"
1726,III.  KING AT HOME,"Maisonforte had been honourable and kindly, and the Lady Elftrud had"
1727,III.  KING AT HOME,"fared better than many a Saxon bride, still the French and the"
1728,III.  KING AT HOME,"Breton dames of the neighbourhood had looked down on her, and the"
1729,III.  KING AT HOME,"retainers had taught her son to look on the English race as swine,"
1730,III.  KING AT HOME,"boors, and churls, ignorant of all gentle arts, of skill and grace."
1731,III.  KING AT HOME,
1732,III.  KING AT HOME,"But here was young David among youths of his own age, tilting as"
1733,III.  KING AT HOME,gracefully and well as any young Norman could--making Bertram long
1734,III.  KING AT HOME,"that his arm should cease to be so heavy and burning, so that he"
1735,III.  KING AT HOME,might show his prowess.
1736,III.  KING AT HOME,
1737,III.  KING AT HOME,Here was a contention with bow and arrow that would not have
1738,III.  KING AT HOME,"disgraced the best men-at-arms of Maisonforte--here again, later in"
1739,III.  KING AT HOME,"the day, was minstrelsy of a higher order than his father's ears had"
1740,III.  KING AT HOME,"cared for, but of which his mother had whispered her traditions."
1741,III.  KING AT HOME,
1742,III.  KING AT HOME,"Here, again, was the chaplain showing his brother-priests with the"
1743,III.  KING AT HOME,"greatest pride and delight a scroll of Latin, copied from a MS."
1744,III.  KING AT HOME,Psalter of the holy and Venerable Beda by the hand of his own dear

1746,III.  KING AT HOME,
1747,III.  KING AT HOME,"Bertram, who could neither read nor write, and knew no more Latin"
1748,III.  KING AT HOME,"than his Paternoster, Credo, and Ave, absolutely did not believe his"
1749,III.  KING AT HOME,"eyes and ears till he had asked the question, whether this were"
1750,III.  KING AT HOME,indeed the youth's work.  How could it be possible to wield pen as
1751,III.  KING AT HOME,well as lance?
1752,III.  KING AT HOME,
1753,III.  KING AT HOME,But the wonder of all was the Atheling.  After an absence of more
1754,III.  KING AT HOME,"than a year, there was much to be adjusted, and his authority on his"
1755,III.  KING AT HOME,"own lands was thoroughly judicial even for life or death, since even"
1756,III.  KING AT HOME,under Norman sway he held the power of an earl.
1757,III.  KING AT HOME,

2079,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2080,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Walter uttered an imprecation upon Roger, and a still stronger one"
2081,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"on Sigbert's meddling.  But instantly the cry was, ""Where is"
2082,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Sigbert?"""
2083,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,

2086,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,where Sigbert was; but no one could tell.
2087,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2088,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Gone over to the enemy, the old traitor,"" said Walter, again"
2089,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,dropping on the divan.

2099,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2100,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"It was a promising quarrel, but their lips were too dry to keep it"
2101,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"up for more than a snarl or two.  Walter cast himself down, and bade"
2102,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,old Tata fan him; why should Mabel have it all to herself?
2103,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2104,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Then sounds of wrangling were heard below, and Walter roused himself"
2105,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,to go down and interfere.  The men were disputing over some
2106,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,miserable dregs of wine at the bottom of a skin.  Walter shouted to
2107,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"call them to order, but they paid little heed."

2109,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Do not meddle and make, young sir,"" said a low-browed, swarthy"

2137,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,and brutal questions whether he should thus be carried to the

2181,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,were kept in ignorance; but the spirit of discipline and confidence
2182,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"had returned with Sigbert, and no one heeded the murmur.  Meantime,"
2183,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,Sigbert followed the young Lord Walter up the rough winding stairs
2184,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"to the chamber where Mabel lay on her cushions.  ""What! what!"""
2185,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"demanded the boy, pausing to enter.  Sigbert, by way of answer,"
2186,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,quietly produced from some hidden pouch two figs.  Walter snatched
2187,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"at one with a cry of joy.  Mabel held out her hand, then, with a"
2188,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"gasp, drew it back.  ""Has Roger had one?"""
2189,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2190,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Sigbert signed in the affirmative, and Mabel took a bite of the"

2198,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2199,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""For shame, my lord,"" Sigbert did not scruple to say, nor could the"
2200,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"thirsty girl help finishing the refreshing morsel, while Walter,"
2201,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"with some scanty murmur of excuse, demanded where it came from, and"
2202,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,what Sigbert had meant by promises of safety.
2203,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2204,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Sir,"" said Sigbert, ""you may remember how some time back your"

2213,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Now, in our extremity, I bethought me of it, and resolved to try"
2214,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"whether the prisoner had truly escaped, for where he went, we might"
2215,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"go.  Long and darksome is the way underground, but it opens at last"

2229,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""You will find chill enough, lady, long ere you reach the river,"""
2230,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"said Sigbert.  ""You must wrap yourself well.  'Tis an ugsome"
2231,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"passage; but your heart must not fail you, for it is the only hope"

2233,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2234,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,The two young people were far too glad to hear of any prospect of
2235,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"release, to think much of the dangers or discomforts of the mode."
2236,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Walter danced for joy up and down the room like a young colt, as he"
2237,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"thought of being in a few hours more in the free open air, with the"
2238,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"sound of water rippling below, and the shade of trees above him."
2239,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Mabel threw herself on her knees before her rude crucifix, partly in"
2240,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"thankfulness, partly in dread of the passage that was to come first."
2241,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2242,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Like going through the grave to life,"" she murmured to her nurse."
2243,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2244,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"And when the scanty garrison was gathered together, as many as"
2245,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"possible provided with brands that might serve as torches, and"
2246,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Sigbert led them, lower and lower, down rugged steps hewn in the"
2247,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"rock, through vaults where only a gleam came from above, and then"
2248,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"through deeper cavernous places, intensely dark, there was a shudder"
2249,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,perceptible by the clank and rattle of the armour which each had
2250,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"donned.  In the midst, Walter paused and exclaimed--"
2251,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2252,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Our banner!  How leave it to the Paynim dogs?"""
2253,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2254,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""It's here, sir,"" said Sigbert, showing a bundle on his back."
2255,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2256,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Warning to the foe to break in and seek us,"" grumbled Gilbert."
2257,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2258,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Not so,"" replied Sigbert.  ""I borrowed an old wrapper of nurse's"

2263,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,entrance save on hands and knees.
2264,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2265,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""That den!"" exclaimed Walter.  ""'Tis a rat-hole.  Never can we go"
2266,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"that way."""
2267,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2268,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""I have tried it, sir,"" quoth Sigbert.  ""Where I can go, you can go."
2269,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Your sister quails not."""
2270,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2271,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""It is fearful,"" said Mabel, unable to repress a shiver; ""but,"

2273,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"guard us."""
2274,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2275,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""The worst and lowest part only lasts for a few rods,"" explained"
2276,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Sigbert.  ""Now, sir, give your orders.  Torches and lanterns, save"
2277,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Hubert's and nurse's, to be extinguished.  We cannot waste them too"
2278,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"soon, but beware of loosing hold on them."""
2279,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2280,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Walter repeated the orders thus dictated to him, and Sigbert"
2281,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,arranged the file.  It was absolutely needful that Sigbert should go
2282,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,first to lead the way.  Mabel was to follow him for the sake of his
2283,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"help, then her brother, next nurse, happily the only other female."
2284,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,Between two stout and trustworthy men the wounded Roger came.  Then
2285,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"one after another the rest of the men-at-arms and servants, five-"
2286,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"and-twenty in number.  The last of the file was Hubert, with a lamp;"
2287,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,the others had to move in darkness.  There had been no horse of any
2288,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"value in the castle, for the knight's charger had been mortally hurt"
2289,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"in his last expedition, and there had been no opportunity of"
2290,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"procuring another.  A deerhound, however, pushed and scrambled to"
2291,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"the front, and Sigbert observed that he might be of great use in"
2292,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"running before them.  Before entering, however, Sigbert gave the"
2293,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"caution that no word nor cry must be uttered aloud, hap what might,"
2294,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"until permission was given, for they would pass under the Saracen"
2295,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"camp, and there was no knowing whether the sounds would reach the"
2296,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,ears above ground.
2297,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2298,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"A strange plunge it was into the utter darkness, crawling on hands"
2299,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"and knees, with the chill cavernous gloom and rock seeming to press"
2300,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"in upon those who slowly crept along, the dim light of Sigbert's"
2301,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,lamp barely showing as he slowly moved on before.  One of the two in
2302,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"the rear was dropped and extinguished in the dismal passage, a loss"
2303,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"proclaimed by a suppressed groan passing along the line, and a"
2304,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"louder exclamation from Walter, causing Sigbert to utter a sharp"
2305,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"'Hush!' enforced by a thud and tramp above, as if the rock were"
2306,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"coming down on them, but which probably was the trampling of horses"
2307,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,in the camp above.
2308,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2309,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"The smoke of the lamp in front drifted back, and the air was more"
2310,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"and more oppressive.  Mabel, with set teeth and compressed lips,"
2311,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"struggled on, clinging tight to the end of the cord which Sigbert"
2312,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"had tied to his body for her to hold by, while in like manner"
2313,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,Walter's hand was upon her dress.  It became more and more difficult
2314,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"to breathe, or crawl on, till at last, just as there was a sense"
2315,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"that it was unbearable, and that it would be easier to lie still and"
2316,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"die than be dragged an inch farther, the air became freer, the roof"
2317,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"seemed to be farther away, the cavern wider, and the motion freer."
2318,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2319,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Sigbert helped his young lady to stand upright, and one by one all"
2320,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,the train regained their feet.  The lamp was passed along to be
2321,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"rekindled, speech was permitted, crevices above sometimes admitted"
2322,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"air, sometimes dripped with water.  The worst was over--probably the"
2323,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"first part had been excavated, the farther portion was one of the"
2324,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"many natural 'dens and caves of the earth,' in which Palestine"
2325,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"abounds.  There was still a considerable distance to be traversed,"
2326,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"the lamps burnt out, and had to be succeeded by torches carefully"
2327,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"husbanded, for the way was rough and rocky, and a stumble might end"
2328,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"in a fall into an abyss.  In time, however, openings of side"
2329,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"galleries were seen, niches in the wall, and tokens that the outer"
2330,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,portion of the cavern had been once a burial-place of the ancient
2331,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Israelites--'the dog Jews,' as the Crusaders called them, with a"
2332,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,shudder of loathing and contempt.
2333,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2334,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,And joy infinite--clear daylight and a waving tree were perceptible
2335,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"beyond.  It was daylight, was it? but the sun was low.  Five hours"
2336,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"at least had been spent in that dismal transit, before the"
2337,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"exhausted, soiled, and chilled company stepped forth into a green"
2338,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,thicket with the Jordan rushing far below.  Five weeks' siege in a
2339,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"narrow fortress, then the two miles of subterranean struggle--these"
2340,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"might well make the grass beneath the wild sycamore, the cork-tree,"
2341,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"the long reeds, the willows, above all, the sound of the flowing"
2342,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"water, absolute ecstasy.  There was an instant rush for the river,"
2343,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,impeded by many a thorn-bush and creeper; but almost anything green
2344,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"was welcome at the moment, and the only disappointment was at the"
2345,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"height and steepness of the banks of rock.  However, at last one"
2346,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,happy man found a place where it was possible to climb down to the
2347,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"shingly bed of the river, close to a great mass of the branching"
2348,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,headed papyrus reed.  Into the muddy but eminently sweet water most
2349,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"of them waded; helmets became cups, hands scooped up the water,"
2350,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,there were gasps of joy and refreshment and blessing on the cool
2351,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,wave so long needed.
2352,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2353,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Sigbert and Walter between them helped down Mabel and her nurse, and"
2354,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"found a secure spot for them, where weary faces, feet, and hands"
2355,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,might be laved in the pool beneath a rock.
2356,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2357,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Then, taking up a bow and arrows laid down by one of the men,"
2358,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,Sigbert applied himself to the endeavour to shoot some of the water-
2359,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,fowl which were flying wildly about over the reeds in the unwonted
2360,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,disturbance caused by the bathers.  He brought down two or three of
2361,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"the duck kind, and another of the party had bethought him of angling"
2362,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"with a string and one of the only too numerous insects, and had"
2363,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,caught sundry of the unsuspecting and excellent fish.  He had also
2364,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"carefully preserved a little fire, and, setting his boy to collect"
2365,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"fuel, he produced embers enough to cook both fish and birds"
2366,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,sufficiently to form an appetising meal for those who had been
2367,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,reduced to scraps of salt food for full a fortnight.
2368,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2369,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""All is well so far,"" said Walter, with his little lordly air.  ""We"
2370,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,have arranged our retreat with great skill.  The only regret is that
2371,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,I have been forced to leave the castle to the enemy! the castle we
2372,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"were bound to defend."""
2373,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2374,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Nay, sir, if it be your will,"" said Sigbert, ""the tables might yet"
2375,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"be turned on the Saracen."""
2376,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2377,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"With great eagerness Walter asked how this could be, and Sigbert"
2378,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,reminded him that many a time it had been observed from the tower
2379,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"that, though the Saracens kept careful watch on the gates of the"
2380,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"besieged so as to prevent a sally, they left the rear of their camp"
2381,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"absolutely undefended, after the ordinary Eastern fashion, and"
2382,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Sigbert, with some dim recollection of rhymed chronicles of Gideon"
2383,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"and of Jonathan, believed that these enemies might be surprised"
2384,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"after the same fashion as theirs.  Walter leapt up for joy, but"
2385,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Sigbert had to remind him that the sun was scarcely set, and that"
2386,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,time must be given for the Saracens to fall asleep before the
2387,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"attack; besides that, his own men needed repose."
2388,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2389,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""There is all the distance to be traversed,"" said Walter."
2390,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2391,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Barely a league, sir."""
2392,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2393,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"It was hard to believe that the space, so endless underground, was"
2394,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"so short above, and Walter was utterly incredulous, till, climbing"
2395,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"the side of the ravine so high as to be above the trees, Sigbert"
2396,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,showed him the familiar landmarks known in hunting excursions with
2397,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,his father.  He was all eagerness; but Sigbert insisted on waiting
2398,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"till past midnight before moving, that the men might have time to"
2399,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"regain their vigour by sleep, and also that there might be time for"
2400,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,the Saracens to fall into the deepest of all slumbers in full
2401,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,security.
2402,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2403,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"The moon was low in the West when Sigbert roused the party, having"
2404,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"calculated that it would light them on the way, but would be set by"
2405,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,the time the attack was to be made.
2406,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2407,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,For Mabel's security it was arranged that a small and most unwilling
2408,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"guard should remain with her, near enough to be able to perceive how"
2409,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,matters went; and if there appeared to be defeat and danger for her
2410,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"brother, there would probably be full time to reach Tiberias even on"
2411,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,foot.
2412,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2413,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"However, the men of the party had little fear that flight would be"
2414,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"needed, for, though perhaps no one would have thought of the scheme"
2415,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"for himself, there was a general sense that what Sigbert devised was"
2416,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"prudent, and that he would not imperil his young lord and lady upon"
2417,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,a desperate venture.
2418,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2419,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Keeping well and compactly together, the little band moved on, along"
2420,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"arid, rocky paths, starting now and then at the howls of the jackals"
2421,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"which gradually gathered into a pack, and began to follow, as if--"
2422,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"some one whispered--they scented prey, ""On whom?"" was the question."
2423,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2424,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"On a cliff looking down on the Arab camp, and above it on the dark"
2425,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"mass of the castle, where, in the watch-tower, Sigbert had left a"
2426,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"lamp burning, they halted just as the half-moon was dipping below"
2427,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,the heights towards the Mediterranean.  Here the Lady Mabel and her
2428,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,guard were to wait until they heard the sounds which to their
2429,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,practised ears would show how the fight went.
2430,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2431,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"The Arab shout of victory they knew only too well, and it was to be"
2432,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,the signal of flight towards Tiberias; but if success was with the
2433,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"assailants, the war-cry 'Deus vult,' and 'St. Hubert for Hundberg,'"
2434,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,were to be followed by the hymn of victory as the token that it was
2435,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,safe to descend.
2436,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2437,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"All was dark, save for the magnificent stars of an Eastern night, as"
2438,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Mabel, her nurse, and the five men, commanded by the wounded Roger,"
2439,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,stood silently praying while listening intently to the muffled tramp
2440,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"of their own people, descending on the blacker mass denoting the"
2441,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,Saracen tents.
2442,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2443,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"The sounds of feet died away, only the jackal's whine and moan, were"
2444,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,heard.  Then suddenly came a flash of lights in different
2445,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"directions, and shouts here, there, everywhere, cries, yells,"
2446,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"darkness, an undistinguishable medley of noise, the shrill shriek of"
2447,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"the Moslem, and the exulting war-cry of the Christian ringing"
2448,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"farther and farther off, in the long valley leading towards the"
2449,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,Jordan fords.
2450,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2451,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,Dawn began to break--overthrown tents could be seen.  Mabel had time
2452,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"to wonder whether she was forgotten, when the hymn began to sound,"
2453,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"pealing on her ears up the pass, and she had not had time for more"
2454,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"than an earnest thanksgiving, and a few steps down the rocky"
2455,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"pathway, before a horse's tread was heard, and a man-at-arms came"
2456,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"towards her leading a slender, beautiful Arab horse.  ""All well! the"
2457,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"young lord and all.  The Saracens, surprised, fled without ever"
2458,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,guessing the number of their foes.  The Sheik made prisoner in his
2459,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"tent.  Ay, and a greater still, the Emir Hussein Bey, who had"
2460,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,arrived to take possession of the castle only that very evening.
2461,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"What a ransom he would pay!  Horses and all were taken, the spoil of"
2462,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"the country round, and Master Sigbert had sent this palfrey for Lady"
2463,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Mabel to ride down."""
2464,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2465,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Perhaps Sigbert, in all his haste and occupation, had been able to"
2466,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,discern that the gentle little mare was not likely to display the
2467,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Arab steed's perilous attachment to a master, for Mabel was safely"
2468,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"mounted, and ere sunrise was greeted by her joyous and victorious"
2469,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"brother.  ""Is not this noble, sister?  Down went the Pagan dogs"
2470,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,before my good sword!  There are a score of them dragged off to the
2471,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,dead man's hollow for the jackals and vultures; but I kept one
2472,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"fellow uppermost to show you the gash I made!  Come and see."""
2473,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2474,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,Roger here observed that the horse might grow restive at the
2475,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"carcase, and Mabel was excused the sight, though Walter continued to"
2476,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"relate his exploits, and demand whether he had not won his spurs by"
2477,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,so grand a ruse and victory.
2478,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2479,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Truly I think Sigbert has,"" said his sister.  ""It was all his"
2480,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"doing."""
2481,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2482,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Sigbert, an English churl!  What are you thinking of, Mabel?"""
2483,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2484,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""I am thinking to whom the honour is due."""
2485,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2486,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""You are a mere child, sister, or you would know better.  Sigbert is"
2487,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,a very fair squire; but what is a squire's business but to put his
2488,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"master in the way of honour?  Do not talk such folly."""
2489,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2490,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Mabel was silenced, and after being conducted across the bare"
2491,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"trampled ground among the tents of the Arabs, she re-entered the"
2492,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"castle, where in the court groups of disarmed Arabs stood, their"
2493,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"bournouses pulled over their brows, their long lances heaped in a"
2494,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"corner, grim and disconsolate at their discomfiture and captivity."
2495,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2496,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"A repast of stewed kid, fruit, and sherbet was prepared for her and"
2497,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"her brother from the spoil, after which both were weary enough to"
2498,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,throw themselves on their cushions for a long sound sleep.
2499,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2500,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Mabel slept the longer, and when she awoke, she found that the sun"
2501,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"was setting, and that supper was nearly ready."
2502,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2503,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Walter met her just as she had arranged her dress, to bid nurse make"
2504,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"ready her bales, for they were to start at dawn on the morrow for"
2505,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,Tiberias.  It was quite possible that the enemy might return in
2506,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"force to deliver their Emir.  A small garrison, freshly provisioned,"
2507,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,could hold out the castle until relief could be sent; but it would
2508,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"be best to conduct the two important prisoners direct to the King,"
2509,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,to say nothing of Walter's desire to present them and to display
2510,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,these testimonies of his prowess before the Court of Jerusalem.
2511,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2512,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"The Emir was a tall, slim, courteous Arab, with the exquisite"
2513,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,manners of the desert.  Both he and the Sheik were invited to the
2514,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,meal.  Both looked startled and shocked at the entrance of the fair-
2515,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"haired damsel, and the Sheik crouched in a corner, with a savage"
2516,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"glare in his eye like a freshly caught wild beast, though the Emir"
2517,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"sat cross-legged on the couch eating, and talking in the LINGUA"
2518,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"FRANCA, which was almost a native tongue, to the son and daughter of"
2519,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,the Crusader.  From him Walter learnt that King Fulk was probably at
2520,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Tiberias, and this quickened the eagerness of all for a start.  It"
2521,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"took place in the earliest morning, so as to avoid the heat of the"
2522,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,day.  How different from the departure in the dark underground
2523,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,passage!
2524,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2525,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,Horses enough had been captured to afford the Emir and the Sheik
2526,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,each his own beautiful steed (the more readily that the creatures
2527,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"could hardly have been ridden by any one else), and their parole was"
2528,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"trusted not to attempt to escape.  Walter, Mabel, Sigbert, and Roger"
2529,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"were also mounted, and asses were found in the camp for the nurse,"
2530,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,and the men who had been hurt in the night's surprise.
2531,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2532,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"The only mischance on the way was that in the noontide halt, just as"
2533,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"the shimmer of the Lake of Galilee met their eyes, under a huge"
2534,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"terebinth-tree, growing on a rock, when all, except Sigbert, had"
2535,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"composed themselves to a siesta, there was a sudden sound of loud"
2536,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"and angry altercation, and, as the sleepers started up, the Emir was"
2537,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,seen grasping the bridle of the horse on which the Sheik sat
2538,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,downcast and abject under the storm of fierce indignant words hurled
2539,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,at him for thus degrading his tribe and all Islam by breaking his
2540,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,plighted word to the Christian.
2541,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2542,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"This was in Arabic, and the Emir further insisted on his prostrating"
2543,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"himself to ask pardon, while he himself in LINGUA FRANCA explained"
2544,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"that the man was of a low and savage tribe of Bedouins, who knew not"
2545,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,how to keep faith.
2546,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2547,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Walter broke out in loud threats, declaring that the traitor dog"
2548,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"ought to be hung up at once on the tree, or dragged along with hands"
2549,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,tied behind him; but Sigbert contented himself with placing a man at
2550,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"each side of his horse's head, as they proceeded on their way to the"
2551,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"strongly fortified town of the ancient Herods, perched at the head"
2552,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"of the dark gray Lake of Galilee, shut in by mountain peaks.  The"
2553,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"second part of the journey was necessarily begun in glowing heat,"
2554,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,for it was most undesirable to have to spend a night in the open
2555,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"country, and it was needful to push on to a fortified hospice or"
2556,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"monastery of St. John, which formed a half-way house."
2557,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2558,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Weary, dusty, athirst, they came in sight of it in the evening; and"
2559,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,Walter and Roger rode forward to request admittance.  The porter
2560,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,begged them to wait when he heard that the party included women and
2561,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Saracen prisoners; and Walter began to storm.  However, a few"
2562,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"moments more brought a tall old Knight Hospitalier to the gate, and"
2563,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,he made no difficulties as to lodging the Saracens in a building at
2564,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"the end of the Court, where they could be well guarded; and Mabel"
2565,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,and her nurse were received in a part of the precincts appropriated
2566,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,to female pilgrims.
2567,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2568,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"It was a bare and empty place, a round turret over the gateway, with"
2569,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"a stone floor, and a few mats rolled up in the corner, mats which"
2570,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,former pilgrims had not left in an inviting condition.
2571,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2572,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"However, the notions of comfort of the twelfth century were not"
2573,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,exacting.  Water to wash away the dust of travel was brought to the
2574,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"door, and was followed by a substantial meal on roasted kid and thin"
2575,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,cakes of bread.  Sigbert came up with permission for the women to
2576,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"attend compline, though only strictly veiled; and Mabel knelt in the"
2577,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"little cool cryptlike chapel, almost like the late place of her"
2578,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"escape, and returned thanks for the deliverance from their recent"
2579,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,peril.
2580,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2581,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Then, fresh mats and cushions having been supplied, the damsel and"
2582,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"her nurse slept profoundly, and were only roused by a bell for a"
2583,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"mass in the darkness just before dawn, after which they again set"
2584,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"forth, the commander of the Hospice himself, and three or four"
2585,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"knights, accompanying them, and conversing familiarly with the Emir"
2586,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,on the current interests of Palestine.
2587,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2588,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"About half-way onward, the glint and glitter of spears was seen amid"
2589,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,a cloud of dust on the hill-path opposite.  The troop drew together
2590,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"on their guard, though, as the Hospitalier observed, from the side"
2591,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,of Tiberias an enemy could scarcely come.  A scout was sent forward
2592,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"to reconnoitre; but, even before he came spurring joyously back, the"
2593,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"golden crosses of Jerusalem had been recognised, and confirmed his"
2594,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"tidings that it was the rearguard of the army, commanded by King"
2595,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Fulk himself, on the way to the relief of the Castle of Gebel-Aroun."
2596,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2597,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"In a brief half-hour more, young Walter de Hundberg, with his sister"
2598,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"by his side, was kneeling before an alert, slender, wiry figure in"
2599,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"plain chamois leather, with a worn sunburnt face and keen blue eyes--"
2600,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,Fulk of Anjou--who had resigned his French county to lead the
2601,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,crusading cause in Palestine.
2602,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2603,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Stand up, fair youth, and tell thy tale, and how thou hast"
2604,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"forestalled our succour."""
2605,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2606,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Walter told his tale of the blockaded castle, the underground"
2607,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"passage, and the dexterous surprise of the besiegers, ending by"
2608,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"presenting, not ungracefully, his captives to the pleasure of the"
2609,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,King.
2610,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2611,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Why, this is well done!"" exclaimed Fulk.  ""Thou art a youth of"
2612,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"promise, and wilt well be a prop to our grandson's English throne."
2613,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,Thou shalt take knighthood from mine own hand as thy prowess well
2614,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"deserveth.  And thou, fair damsel, here is one whom we could scarce"
2615,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,hold back from rushing with single hand to deliver his betrothed.
2616,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Sir Raymond of Courtwood, you are balked of winning thy lady at the"
2617,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"sword's point, but thou wilt scarce rejoice the less."""
2618,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2619,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"A dark-eyed, slender young knight, in bright armour, drew towards"
2620,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Mabel, and she let him take her hand; but she was intent on"
2621,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"something else, and exclaimed--"
2622,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2623,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Oh, sir, Sir King, let me speak one word!  The guerdon should not"
2624,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"be only my brother's.  The device that served us was--our squire's."""
2625,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2626,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,The Baron of Courtwood uttered a fierce exclamation.  Walter
2627,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"muttered, ""Mabel, do not be such a meddling fool""; but the King"
2628,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"asked, ""And who may this same squire be?"""
2629,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2630,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""An old English churl,"" said Walter impatiently.  ""My father took"
2631,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"him as his squire for want of a better."""
2632,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2633,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""And he has been like a father to us,"" added Mabel"
2634,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2635,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Silence, sister!  It is not for you to speak!"" petulantly cried"
2636,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Walter.  ""Not that the Baron of Courtwood need be jealous,"" added"
2637,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"he, laughing somewhat rudely.  ""Where is the fellow?  Stand forth,"
2638,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Sigbert."""
2639,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2640,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"Travel and heat-soiled, sunburnt, gray, and ragged, armour rusted,"
2641,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"leathern garment stained, the rugged figure came forward, footsore"
2642,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"and lame, for he had given up his horse to an exhausted man-at-arms."
2643,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,A laugh went round at the bare idea of the young lady's preferring
2644,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"such a form to the splendid young knight, her destined bridegroom."
2645,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,
2646,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"""Is this the esquire who hath done such good service, according to"

2740,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"city was safe, none remembered the poor man.  True, the preacher"
2741,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"gave it a mystic meaning, and interpreted it as meaning the"
2742,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,"emphatically Poor Man by Whom Salvation came, and Whom too few bear"
2743,SIGBERT'S GUERDON,in mind.  Yet such a higher meaning did not exclude the thought of

2961,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.",must be used enough to society to do the honours genially and
2962,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.","gracefully, and not have her head turned by being the chief young"
2963,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.","lady in the place.  She ought to be well bred, if not high bred,"
2964,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.","enough to give a tone to the society of her contemporaries, and"
2965,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.",above all she must not flirt.  If I found flirtation going on with
2966,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.","the officers, I should send her home on the spot.  Of course, all"
2967,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.","this means that she must have the only real spring of good breeding,"
2968,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.","and be a thoroughly good, religious, unselfish, right-minded girl;"
2969,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.",otherwise we should have to rue our scheme.  In spite of all you
2970,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.","would do towards moulding and training a young maiden, there will be"
2971,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.",so many distractions and unavoidable counter-influences that the

2973,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.",manners ready formed.  There ought likewise to be cultivation and
2974,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.",intelligence to profit by the opportunities she will have.  I should
2975,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.","not like Greece and Italy, to say nothing of Egypt and Palestine, to"
2976,"UNITED SERVICE CLUB, 29TH JUNE.",be only so much gape seed.  You must have an eye likewise to good

2991,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.",impossible she' of a youth under twenty.  One comfort is that such
2992,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.",is the blindness of your kind that you will imagine all these charms
2993,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","in whatever good, ladylike, simple-hearted girl I pitch upon, and"
2994,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.",such I am sure I shall find all my nieces.  The only difficulty will
2995,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","be in deciding, and that will be fixed by details of style, and the"
2996,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.",parents' willingness to spare their child.
2997,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.",
2998,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.",This is an excellent plan of yours for bringing the whole family
2999,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.",together round our dear old mother and her home daughter.  This is
3000,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","the end house of three on a little promontory, and has a charming"
3001,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","view--of the sea in the first place, and then on the one side of"
3002,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","what is called by courtesy the parade, on the top of the sea wall"
3003,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","where there is a broad walk leading to S. Clements, nearly two miles"
3004,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","off.  There are not above a dozen houses altogether, and the hotel"
3005,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","is taken for the two families from London and Oxford, while the"
3006,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","Druces are to be in the house but one next to us, the middle one"
3007,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.",being unluckily let off to various inhabitants.  We have one bedroom
3008,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","free where we may lodge some of the overflowings, and I believe the"
3009,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.",whole party are to take their chief meals together in the large room
3010,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","at the hotel.  The houses are mostly scattered, being such as"
3011,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","fortunate skippers build as an investment, and that their wives may"
3012,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.",amuse themselves with lodgers in their absence.  The church is the
3013,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","weakest point in this otherwise charming place.  The nearest, and"
3014,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","actually the parish church, is a hideous compo structure, built in"
3015,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.",the worst of times as a chapel of ease to S. Clements.  I am afraid
3016,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.",my mother's loyalty to the parochial system will make her secure a
3017,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","pew there, though at the farther end of the town there is a new"
3018,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","church which is all that can be wished, and about a mile and a half"
3019,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","inland there is a village church called Hollyford, held, I believe,"
3020,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.",by a former fellow-curate of Horace Druce.  Perhaps they will
3021,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.","exchange duties, if Horace can be persuaded to take a longer holiday"
3022,"1 SHINGLE COTTAGES, NEW COVE, S. CLEMENTS, 30TH JUNE.",than merely for the three weeks he has provided for at Bourne Parva.

3035,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3036,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3037,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"JULY 4.--By noon to-day arrived Martyn, {127} with Mary his wife,"
3038,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Margaret and Avice their daughters, Uchtred their second son, and"
3039,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"poor Harry Fulford's orphan, Isabel, who has had a home with them"
3040,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,ever since she left school.  Though she is only a cousin once
3041,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"removed, she seems to fall into the category of eligible nieces, and"
3042,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"indeed she seems the obvious companion for us, as she has no home,"
3043,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and seems to me rather set aside among the others.  I hope there is
3044,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"no jealousy, for she is much better looking than her cousins, with"
3045,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"gentle, liquid eyes, a pretty complexion, and a wistful expression."
3046,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Moreover, she is dressed in a quiet ladylike way, whereas grandmamma"
3047,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"looked out just now in the twilight and said, ""My dear Martyn, have"
3048,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"you brought three boys down?""  It was a showery, chilly evening, and"
3049,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,they were all out admiring the waves.  Ulsters and sailor hats were
3050,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"appropriate enough then, but the genders were not easy to"
3051,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"distinguish, especially as the elder girl wears her hair short--no"
3052,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,improvement to a keen face which needs softening.  She is much too
3053,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"like a callow undergraduate altogether, and her sister follows suit,"
3054,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,though perhaps with more refinement of feature--indeed she looks
3055,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"delicate, and was soon called in.  They are in slight mourning, and"
3056,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"appear in gray serges.  They left a strap of books on the sofa, of"
3057,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,somewhat alarming light literature for the seaside.  Bacon's ESSAYS
3058,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"AND ELEMENTS OF LOGIC were the first Emily beheld, and while she"
3059,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"stood regarding them with mingled horror and respect, in ran Avice"
3060,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to fetch them, as the two sisters are reading up for the Oxford"
3061,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,exam--'ination' she added when she saw her two feeble-minded aunts
3062,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"looking for the rest of the word.  However, she says it is only Pica"
3063,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,who is going up for it this time.  She herself was not considered
3064,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,strong enough.  Yet there have those two set themselves down with
3065,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"their books under the rocks, blind to all the glory of sea and"
3066,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"shore, deaf to the dash and ripple of the waves!  I long to go and"
3067,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,shout Wordsworth's warning about 'growing double' to them.  I am
3068,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,glad to say that Uchtred has come and fetched Avice away.  I can
3069,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,hardly believe Martyn and Mary parents to this grown-up family.
3070,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"They look as youthful as ever, and are as active and vigorous, and"
3071,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,full of their jokes with one another and their children.  They are
3072,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"now gone out to the point of the rocks at the end of our promontory,"
3073,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"fishing for microscopical monsters, and comporting themselves boy"
3074,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and girl fashion.
3075,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3076,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Isabel has meantime been chatting very pleasantly with grandmamma,"
3077,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and trying to extricate us from our bewilderment as to names and
3078,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"nicknames.  My poor mother, after strenuously preventing"
3079,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"abbreviations in her own family, has to endure them in her"
3080,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"descendants, and as every one names a daughter after her, there is"
3081,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"some excuse!  This Oxford Margaret goes by the name of Pie or Pica,"
3082,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"apparently because it is the remotest portion of Magpie, and her"
3083,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"London cousin is universally known as Metelill--the Danish form, I"
3084,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,believe; but in the Bourne Parva family the young Margaret Druce is
3085,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"nothing worse than Meg, and her elder sister remains Jane.  ""Nobody"
3086,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"would dare to call her anything else,"" says Isa.  Avice cannot but"
3087,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"be sometimes translated into the Bird; while my poor name, in my"
3088,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"second London niece, has become the masculine Charley.  ""I shall"
3089,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"know why when I see her,"" says Isa laughing.  This good-natured"
3090,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"damsel is coming out walking with us old folks, and will walk on"
3091,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"with me, when grandmamma turns back with Emily.  Her great desire is"
3092,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,to find the whereabouts of a convalescent home in which she and her
3093,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,cousins have subscribed to place a poor young dressmaker for a six
3094,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,weeks' rest; but I am afraid it is on the opposite side of S.
3095,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Clements, too far for a walk."
3096,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3097,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,JULY 5.--Why did you never tell me how charming Metelill is?  I
3098,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"never supposed the Fulford features capable of so much beauty, and"
3099,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,the whole manner and address are so delightful that I do not wonder
3100,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"that all her cousins are devoted to her; Uchtred, or Butts, as they"
3101,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"are pleased to name him, has brightened into another creature since"
3102,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"she came, and she seems like sunshine to us all.  As to my namesake,"
3103,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,I am sorry to say that I perceive the appropriateness of Charley;
3104,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"but I suppose it is style, for the masculine dress which in Pica and"
3105,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Avice has an air of being worn for mere convenience' sake, and is"
3106,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"quite ladylike, especially on Avice, has in her an appearance of"
3107,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"defiance and coquetry.  Her fox-terrier always shares her room,"
3108,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"which therefore is eschewed by her sister, and this has made a"
3109,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"change in our arrangements.  We had thought the room in our house,"
3110,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"which it seems is an object of competition, would suit best for Jane"
3111,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Druce and one of her little sisters; but a hint was given by either
3112,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Pica or her mother that it would be a great boon to let Jane and
3113,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Avice share it, as they are very great friends, and we had the"
3114,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"latter there installed.  However, this fox-terrier made Metelill"
3115,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"protest against sleeping at the hotel with her sister, and her"
3116,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"mother begged us to take her in.  Thereupon, Emily saw Isa looking"
3117,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"annoyed, and on inquiry she replied sweetly, ""Oh, never mind, aunty"
3118,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,dear; I daresay Wasp won't be so bad as he looks; and I'll try not
3119,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to be silly, and then I daresay Charley will not tease me!  Only I"
3120,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,had hoped to be with dear Metelill; but no doubt she will prefer her
3121,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Bird--people always do.""  So they were going to make that poor child"
3122,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the victim!  For it seems Pica has a room to herself, and will not"
3123,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,give it up or take in any one.  Emily went at once to Avice and
3124,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"asked whether she would mind going to the hotel, and letting Isa be"
3125,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"with Metelill, and this she agreed to at once.  I don't know why I"
3126,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"tell you all these details, except that they are straws to show the"
3127,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"way of the wind, and you will see how Isabel is always the"
3128,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"sacrifice, unless some one stands up for her.  Here comes Martyn to"
3129,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,beguile me out to the beach.
3130,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3131,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"JULY 6 (Sunday).--My mother drove to church and took Edith, who was"
3132,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,glad neither to walk nor to have to skirmish for a seat.  Isa walked
3133,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"with Emily and me, and so we made up our five for our seat, which,"
3134,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to our dismay, is in the gallery, but, happily for my mother, the"
3135,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,stairs are easy.  The pews there are not quite so close to one's
3136,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"nose as those in the body of the church; they are a little wider,"
3137,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and are furnished with hassocks instead of traps to prevent
3138,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"kneeling, so that we think ourselves well off, and we were agreeably"
3139,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,surprised at the service.  There is a new incumbent who is striving
3140,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,to modify things as well as his people and their architecture
3141,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"permit, and who preached an excellent sermon.  So we triumph over"
3142,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the young folk, who try to persuade us that the gallery is a"
3143,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,judgment on us for giving in to the hired pew system.  They may
3144,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"banter me as much as they like, but I don't like to see them jest"
3145,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"with grandmamma about it, as if they were on equal terms, and she"
3146,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"does not understand it either.  ""My dear,"" she gravely says, ""your"
3147,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"grandpapa always said it was a duty to support the parish church."""
3148,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""Nothing will do but the Congregational system in these days; don't"
3149,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"you think so?"" began Pica dogmatically, when her father called her"
3150,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"off.  Martyn cannot bear to see his mother teased.  He and his wife,"
3151,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"with the young ones, made their way to Hollyford, where they found a"
3152,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"primitive old church and a service to match, but were terribly late,"
3153,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and had to sit in worm-eaten pews near the door, amid scents of"
3154,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"peppermint and southernwood.  On the way back, Martyn fraternised"
3155,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"with a Mr. Methuen, a Cambridge tutor with a reading party, who has,"
3156,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"I am sorry to say, arrived at the house VIS-A-VIS to ours, on the"
3157,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,other side of the cove.  Our Oxford young ladies turn up their noses
3158,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"at the light blue, and say the men have not the finish of the dark;"
3159,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,but Charley is in wild spirits.  I heard her announcing the arrival
3160,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"thus:  ""I say, Isa, what a stunning lark!  Not but that I was up to"
3161,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"it all the time, or else I should have skedaddled; for this place"
3162,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"was bound to be as dull as ditchwater.""  ""But how did you know?"""
3163,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"asked Isa.  ""Why, Bertie Elwood tipped me a line that he was coming"
3164,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"down here with his coach, or else I should have told the mater I"
3165,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"couldn't stand it and gone to stay with some one.""  This Bertie"
3166,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Elwood is, it seems, one of the many London acquaintance.  He looks"
3167,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"inoffensive, and so do the others, but I wish they had chosen some"
3168,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"other spot for their studies, and so perhaps does their tutor,"
3169,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,though he is now smoking very happily under a rock with Martyn.
3170,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3171,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,JULY 7.--Such a delightful evening walk with Metelill and Isa as
3172,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Emily and I had last night, going to evensong in our despised"
3173,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"church!  The others said they could stand no more walking and heat,"
3174,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and yet we met Martyn and Mary out upon the rocks when we were
3175,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"coming home, after being, I must confess, nearly fried to death by"
3176,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the gas and bad air.  They laughed at us and our exertions, all in"
3177,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the way of good humour, but it was not wholesome from parents.  Mary"
3178,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,tried to make me confess that we were coming home in a self-
3179,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"complacent fakir state of triumph in our headaches, much inferior to"
3180,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"her humble revelling in cool sea, sky, and moonlight.  It was like"
3181,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the difference between the BENEDICITE and the TE DEUM, I could not"
3182,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,help thinking; while Emily said a few words to Martyn as to how
3183,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"mamma would be disappointed at his absenting himself from Church,"
3184,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and was answered, ""Ah!  Emily, you are still the good home child of"
3185,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the primitive era,"" which she did not understand; but I faced about"
3186,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and asked if it were not what we all should be.  He answered rather
3187,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"sadly, ""If we could'; and his wife shrugged her shoulders.  Alas! I"
3188,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"fear the nineteenth century tone has penetrated them, and do not"
3189,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,wonder that this poor Isabel does not seem happy in her home.
3190,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3191,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,9.--What a delightful sight is a large family of young things
3192,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"together!  The party is complete, for the Druces arrived yesterday"
3193,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"evening in full force, torn from their bucolic life, as Martyn tells"
3194,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,them.  My poor dear old Margaret!  She does indeed look worn and
3195,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"aged, dragged by cares like a colonist's wife, and her husband is"
3196,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"quite bald, and as spare as a hermit.  It is hard to believe him"
3197,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"younger than Martyn; but then his whole soul is set on Bourne Parva,"
3198,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and hers on him, on the children, on the work, and on making both"
3199,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,ends meet; and they toil five times more severely in one month than
3200,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the professor and his lady in a year, besides having just twice as"
3201,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"many children, all of whom are here except the schoolboys.  Margaret"
3202,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"declares that the entire rest, and the talking to something not"
3203,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"entirely rural, will wind her husband up for the year; and it is"
3204,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"good to see her sitting in a basket-chair by my mother, knitting"
3205,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"indeed, but they both do that like breathing, while they purr away"
3206,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,to one another in a state of perfect repose and felicity.  Meantime
3207,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,her husband talks Oxford with Martyn and Mary.  Their daughter Jane
3208,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"seems to be a most valuable helper to both, but she too has a worn,"
3209,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"anxious countenance, and I fear she may be getting less rest than"
3210,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"her parents, as they have brought only one young nursemaid with"
3211,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"them, and seem to depend on her and Meg for keeping the middle-sized"
3212,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,children in order.  She seems to have all the cares of the world on
3213,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"her young brow, and is much exercised about one of the boxes which"
3214,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,has gone astray on the railway.  What do you think she did this
3215,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,morning?  She started off with Avice at eight o'clock for the S.
3216,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Clements station to see if the telegram was answered, and they went"
3217,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,on to the Convalescent Home and saw the Oxford dressmaker.  It seems
3218,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"that Avice had taken Uchtred with her on Sunday evening, made out"
3219,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the place, and gone to church at S. Clements close by--a very long"
3220,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,walk; but it seems that those foolish girls thought me too fine a
3221,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,lady to like to be seen with her in her round hat on a Sunday.  I
3222,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,wish they could understand what it is that I dislike.  If I objected
3223,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to appearances, I am afraid the poor Druces would fare ill."
3224,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Margaret's girls cannot help being essentially ladies, but they have"
3225,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,not much beauty to begin with--and their dress!  It was chiefly made
3226,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"by their own sewing machine, with the assistance of the Bourne Parva"
3227,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"mantua-maker, superintended by Jane, 'to prevent her from making it"
3228,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"foolish'; and the effect, I grieve to say, is ill-fitting dowdiness,"
3229,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,which becomes grotesque from their self-complacent belief that it
3230,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,displays the only graceful and sensible fashion in the place.  It
3231,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,was laughable to hear them criticising every hat or costume they
3232,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"have seen, quite unaware that they were stared at themselves, till"
3233,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Charley told them people thought they had come fresh out of Lady
3234,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Bountiful's goody-box, which piece of impertinence they took as a"
3235,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"great compliment to their wisdom and excellence.  To be sure, the"
3236,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"fashions are distressing enough, but Metelill shows that they can be"
3237,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"treated gracefully and becomingly, and even Avice makes her serge"
3238,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and hat look fresh and ladylike.  Spite of contrast, Avice and Jane"
3239,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,seem to be much devoted to each other.  Pica and Charley are another
3240,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"pair, and Isa and Metelill--though Metelill is the universal"
3241,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"favourite, and there is always competition for her.  In early"
3242,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"morning I see the brown heads and blue bathing-dresses, a-"
3243,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"mermaiding, as they call it, in the cove below, and they come in all"
3244,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"glowing, with the floating tresses that make Metelill look so"
3245,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"charming, and full of merry adventures at breakfast.  We all meet in"
3246,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the great room at the hotel for a substantial meal at half-past one,"
3247,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and again (most of us at least) at eight; but it is a moot point
3248,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,which of these meals we call dinner.  Very merry both of them are;
3249,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Martyn and Horace Druce are like boys together, and the girls scream"
3250,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"with laughter, rather too much so sometimes.  Charley is very noisy,"
3251,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and so is Meg Druce, when not overpowered by shyness.  She will not"
3252,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"exchange a sentence with any of the elders, but in the general laugh"
3253,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,she chuckles and shrieks like a young Cochin-Chinese chicken
3254,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,learning to crow; and I hear her squealing like a maniac while she
3255,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,is shrimping with the younger ones and Charley.  I must except those
3256,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"two young ladies from the unconscious competition, for one has no"
3257,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"manners at all, and the other affects those of a man; but as to the"
3258,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"rest, they are all as nice as possible, and I can only say, ""How"
3259,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"happy could I be with either.""  Isa, poor girl, seems to need our"
3260,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"care most, and would be the most obliging and attentive.  Metelill"
3261,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"would be the prettiest and sweetest ornament of our drawing-room,"
3262,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and would amuse you the most; Pica, with her scholarly tastes, would"
3263,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"be the best and most appreciative fellow-traveller; and Jane, if she"
3264,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"could or would go, would perhaps benefit the most by being freed"
3265,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"from a heavy strain, and having her views enlarged."
3266,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3267,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"10.--A worthy girl is Jane Druce, but I fear the Vicarage is no"
3268,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"school of manners.  Her mother is sitting with us, and has been"
3269,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,discoursing to grandmamma on her Jane's wonderful helpfulness and
3270,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"activity in house and parish, and how everything hinged on her last"
3271,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,winter when they had whooping-cough everywhere in and out of doors;
3272,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,indeed she doubts whether the girl has ever quite thrown off the
3273,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"effects of all her exertions then.  Suddenly comes a trampling, a"
3274,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"bounce and a rush, and in dashes Miss Jane, fiercely demanding"
3275,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,whether the children had leave to go to the cove.  Poor Margaret
3276,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"meekly responds that she had consented.  ""And didn't you know,"""
3277,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"exclaims the damsel, ""that all their everyday boots are in that"
3278,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"unlucky trunk?""  There is a humble murmur that Chattie had promised"
3279,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to be very careful, but it produces a hotter reply.  ""As if"
3280,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Chattie's promises of that kind could be trusted!  And I had _TOLD_
3281,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"them that they were to keep with baby on the cliff!""  Then came a"
3282,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"real apology for interfering with Jane's plans, to which we listened"
3283,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"aghast, and Margaret was actually getting up to go and look after"
3284,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"her amphibious offspring herself, when her daughter cut her off"
3285,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"short with, ""Nonsense, mamma, you know you are not to do any such"
3286,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"thing!  I must go, that's all, or they won't have a decent boot or"
3287,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"stocking left among them.""  Off she went with another bang, while"
3288,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,her mother began blaming herself for having yielded in haste to the
3289,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"persuasions of the little ones, oblivious of the boots, thus"
3290,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,sacrificing Jane's happy morning with Avice.  My mother showed
3291,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,herself shocked by the tone in which Margaret had let herself be
3292,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"hectored, and this brought a torrent of almost tearful apologies"
3293,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"from the poor dear thing, knowing she did not keep up her authority"
3294,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"or make herself respected as would be good for her girl, but if we"
3295,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"only knew how devoted Jane was, and how much there was to grind and"
3296,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"try her temper, we should not wonder that it gave way sometimes."
3297,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Indeed it was needful to turn away the subject, as Margaret was the"
3298,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,last person we wished to distress.
3299,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3300,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Jane could have shown no temper to the children, for at dinner a"
3301,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"roly-poly person of five years old, who seems to absorb all the fat"
3302,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"in the family, made known that he had had a very jolly day, and he"
3303,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"loved cousin Avice very much indeed, and sister Janie very much"
3304,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"indeeder, and he could with difficulty be restrained from an"
3305,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,expedition to kiss them both then and there.
3306,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3307,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"The lost box was announced while we were at dinner, and Jane is gone"
3308,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,with her faithful Avice to unpack it.  Her mother would have done it
3309,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and sent her boating with the rest, but submitted as usual when"
3310,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,commanded to adhere to the former plan of driving with grandmamma.
3311,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"These Druce children must be excellent, according to their mother,"
3312,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,but they are terribly brusque and bearish.  They are either seen and
3313,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"not heard, or not seen and heard a great deal too much.  Even Jane"
3314,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and Meg, who ought to know better, keep up a perpetual undercurrent"
3315,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"of chatter and giggle, whatever is going on, with any one who will"
3316,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,share it with them.
3317,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3318,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,10.--I am more and more puzzled about the new reading of the Fifth
3319,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Commandment.  None seem to understand it as we used to do.  The
3320,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"parents are content to be used as equals, and to be called by all"
3321,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,sorts of absurd names; and though grandmamma is always kindly and
3322,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"attentively treated, there is no reverence for the relationship.  I"
3323,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"heard Charley call her 'a jolly old party,' and Metelill respond"
3324,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"that she was 'a sweet old thing.'  Why, we should have thought such"
3325,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"expressions about our grandmother a sort of sacrilege, but when I"
3326,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"ventured to hint as much Charley flippantly answered, ""Gracious me,"
3327,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"we are not going back to buckram""; and Metelill, with her caressing"
3328,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"way, declared that she loved dear granny too much to be so stiff and"
3329,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,formal.  I quoted--
3330,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3331,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""If I be a Father, where is My honour?"""
3332,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3333,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"And one of them taking it, I am sorry to say, for a line of secular"
3334,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"poetry, exclaimed at the stiffness and coldness.  Pica then put in"
3335,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"her oar, and began to argue that honour must be earned, and that it"
3336,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,was absurd and illogical to claim it for the mere accident of
3337,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"seniority or relationship.  Jane, not at all conscious of being an"
3338,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"offender, howled at her that this was her horrible liberalism and"
3339,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"neology, while Metelill asked what was become of loyalty.  ""That"
3340,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"depends on what you mean by it,"" returned our girl graduate.  ""LOI-"
3341,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"AUTE, steadfastness to principle, is noble, but personal loyalty, to"
3342,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"some mere puppet or the bush the crown hangs on, is a pernicious"
3343,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"figment.""  Charley shouted that this was the No. 1 letter A point in"
3344,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Pie's prize essay, and there the discussion ended, Isa only sighing"
3345,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to herself, ""Ah, if I had any one to be loyal to!"""
3346,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3347,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""How you would jockey them!"" cried Charley, turning upon her so"
3348,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,roughly that the tears came into her eyes; and I must have put on
3349,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"what you call my Government-house look, for Charley subsided"
3350,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,instantly.
3351,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3352,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"11.--Here was a test as to this same obedience.  The pupils, who are"
3353,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"by this time familiars of the party, had devised a boating and"
3354,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"fishing expedition for all the enterprising, which was satisfactory"
3355,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,to the elders because it was to include both the fathers.
3356,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Unluckily, however, this morning's post brought a summons to Martyn"
3357,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and Mary to fulfil an engagement they have long made to meet an
3358,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"American professor at ---, and they had to start off at eleven"
3359,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"o'clock; and at the same time the Hollyford clergyman, an old"
3360,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"fellow-curate of Horace Druce, sent a note imploring him to take a"
3361,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,funeral.  So the voice of the seniors was for putting off the
3362,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"expedition, but the voice of the juniors was quite the other way."
3363,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,The three families took different lines.  The Druces show obedience
3364,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"though not respect; they growled and grumbled horribly, but"
3365,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"submitted, though with ill grace, to the explicit prohibition.  Non-"
3366,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"interference is professedly Mary's principle, but even she said,"
3367,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"with entreaty veiled beneath the playfulness, when it was pleaded"
3368,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"that two of the youths had oars at Cambridge, ""Freshwater fish, my"
3369,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,dears.  I wish you would wait for us!  I don't want you to attend
3370,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the submarine wedding of our old friends Tame and Isis.""  To which"
3371,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Pica rejoined, likewise talking out of Spenser, that Proteus would"
3372,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,provide a nice ancient nymph to tend on them.  Her father then
3373,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"chimed in, saying, ""You will spare our nerves by keeping to dry land"
3374,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,unless you can secure the ancient mariner who was with us
3375,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"yesterday."""
3376,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3377,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""Come, come, most illustrious,"" said Pica good-humouredly, ""I'm not"
3378,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,going to encourage you to set up for nerves.  You are much better
3379,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"without them, and I must get some medusae."""
3380,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3381,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"It ended with, ""I beg you will not go without that old man,"" the"
3382,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,most authoritative speech I have heard either Martyn or Mary make to
3383,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"their daughters; but it was so much breath wasted on Pica, who"
3384,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,maintains her right to judge for herself.  The ancient mariner had
3385,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,been voted an encumbrance and exchanged for a jolly young waterman.
3386,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3387,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Our other mother, Edith, implored, and was laughed down by Charley,"
3388,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"who declared she could swim, and that she did not think Uncle Martyn"
3389,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,would have been so old-womanish.  Metelill was so tender and
3390,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,caressing with her frightened mother that I thought here at last was
3391,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"submission, and with a good grace.  But after a turn on the"
3392,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"esplanade among the pupils, back came Metelill in a hurry to say,"
3393,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""Dear mother, will you very much _MIND_ if I go?  They will be so"
3394,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"disappointed, and there will be such a fuss if I don't; and Charley"
3395,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"really ought to have some one with her besides Pie, who will heed"
3396,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"nothing but magnifying medusae.""  I am afraid it is true, as Isa"
3397,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"says, that it was all owing to the walk with that young Mr Horne."
3398,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3399,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Poor Edith fell into such a state of nervous anxiety that I could
3400,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"not leave her, and she confided to me how Charley had caught her"
3401,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,foolish masculine affectations in the family of this very Bertie
3402,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Elwood, and told me of the danger of an attachment between Metelill"
3403,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and a young government clerk who is always on the look-out for her.
3404,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""And dear Metelill is so gentle and gracious that she cannot bear to"
3405,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"repel any one,"" says the mother, who would, I see, be thankful to"
3406,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,part with either daughter to our keeping in hopes of breaking off
3407,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"perilous habits.  I was saved, however, from committing myself by"
3408,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,the coming in of Isabel.  That child follows me about like a tame
3409,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"cat, and seems so to need mothering that I cannot bear to snub her."
3410,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3411,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,She came to propound to me a notion that has risen among these
3412,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Oxford girls, namely, that I should take out their convalescent"
3413,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,dressmaker as my maid instead of poor Amelie.  She is quite well
3414,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"now, and going back next week; but a few years in a warm climate"
3415,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,might be the saving of her health.  So I agreed to go with Isa to
3416,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"look at her, and judge whether the charming account I heard was all"
3417,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"youthful enthusiasm.  Edith went out driving with my mother, and we"
3418,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"began our TETE-A-TETE walk, in which I heard a great deal of the"
3419,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"difficulties of that free-and-easy house at Oxford, and how often"
3420,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Isa wishes for some one who would be a real guide and helper,"
3421,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"instead of only giving a playful, slap-dash answer, like good-"
3422,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"natured mockery.  The treatment may suit Mary's own daughters, but"
3423,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"'Just as you please, my dear,' is not good for sensitive, anxious"
3424,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,spirits.  We passed Jane and Avice reading together under a rock; I
3425,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"was much inclined to ask them to join us, but Isa was sure they were"
3426,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"much happier undisturbed, and she was so unwilling to share me with"
3427,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,any one that I let them alone.  I was much pleased with the
3428,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"dressmaker, Maude Harris, who is a nice, modest, refined girl, and"
3429,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,if the accounts I get from her employers bear out what I hear of
3430,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"her, I shall engage her; I shall be glad, for the niece's sake, to"
3431,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,have that sort of young woman about the place.  She speaks most
3432,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,warmly of what the Misses Fulford have done for her.
3433,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3434,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Jane will be disappointed if I cannot have her rival candidate--a
3435,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"pet schoolgirl who works under the Bourne Parva dressmaker.  ""What a"
3436,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"recommendation!"" cries Pica, and there is a burst of mirth, at which"
3437,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Jane looks round and says, ""What is there to laugh at?  Miss"
3438,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Dadworthy is a real good woman, and a real old Bourne Parva person,"
3439,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,so that you may be quite sure Martha will have learnt no nonsense to
3440,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"begin with."""
3441,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3442,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""No,"" says Pica, ""from all such pomps and vanities as style, she"
3443,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"will be quite clear."""
3444,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3445,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,While Avice's friendship goes as far as to say that if Aunt
3446,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Charlotte cannot have Maude, perhaps Martha could get a little more"
3447,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,training.  Whereupon Jane runs off by the yard explanations of the
3448,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"admirable training--religious, moral, and intellectual--of Bourne"
3449,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Parva, illustrated by the best answers of her favourite scholars,"
3450,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"anecdotes of them, and the reports of the inspectors, religious and"
3451,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"secular; and Avice listens with patience, nay, with respectful"
3452,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,sympathy.
3453,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3454,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,12.--We miss Mary and Martyn more than I expected.  Careless and
3455,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"easy-going as they seem, they made a difference in the ways of the"
3456,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"young people; they were always about with them, not as dragons, but"
3457,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,for their own pleasure.  The presence of a professor must needs
3458,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"impose upon young men, and Mary, with her brilliant wit and charming"
3459,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"manners, was a check without knowing it.  The boating party came"
3460,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"back gay and triumphant, and the young men joined in our late meal;"
3461,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and oh, what a noise there was! though I must confess that it was"
3462,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"not they who made the most.  Metelill was not guilty of the noise,"
3463,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,but she was--I fear I must say it--flirting with all her might with
3464,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"a youth on each side of her, and teasing a third; I am afraid she is"
3465,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"one of those girls who are charming to all, and doubly charming to"
3466,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"your sex, and that it will never do to have her among the staff.  I"
3467,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,don't think it is old-maidish in us to be scandalised at her walking
3468,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,up and down the esplanade with young Horne till ten o'clock last
3469,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"night; Charley was behind with Bertie Elwood, and, I grieve to say,"
3470,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,was smoking.  It lasted till Horace Druce went out to tell them that
3471,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Metelill must come in at once, as it was time to shut up the house."
3472,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3473,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,The Oxford girls were safe indoors; Isa working chess problems with
3474,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"another of the lads, Avice keeping Jane company over the putting the"
3475,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"little ones to sleep--in Mount Lebanon, as they call the Druce"
3476,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"lodging--and Pica preserving microscopic objects.  ""Isn't she"
3477,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"awful?"" said one of those pupils.  ""She's worse than all the dons in"
3478,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Cambridge.  She wants to be at it all day long, and all through the"
3479,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"vacation."""
3480,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3481,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,They perfectly flee from her.  They say she is always whipping out a
3482,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,microscope and lecturing upon protoplasms--and there is some truth
3483,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,in the accusation.  She is almost as bad on the emancipation of
3484,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"women, on which there is a standing battle, in earnest with Jane--in"
3485,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"joke with Metelill; but it has, by special orders, to be hushed at"
3486,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"dinner, because it almost terrifies grandmamma.  I fear Pica tries"
3487,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,to despise her!
3488,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3489,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"This morning the girls are all out on the beach in pairs and threes,"
3490,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,the pupils being all happily shut up with their tutor.  I see the
3491,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,invalid lady creep out with her beach-rest from the intermediate
3492,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"house, and come down to her usual morning station in the shade of a"
3493,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"rock, unaware, poor thing, that it has been monopolised by Isa and"
3494,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Metelill.  Oh, girls! why don't you get up and make room for her?"
3495,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"No; she moves on to the next shady place, but there Pica has a"
3496,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"perfect fortification of books spread on her rug, and Charley is"
3497,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"sketching on the outskirts, and the fox-terrier barks loudly.  Will"
3498,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"she go on to the third seat? where I can see, though she cannot,"
3499,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Jane and Avice sitting together, and Freddy shovelling sand at their"
3500,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,feet.  Ah! at last she is made welcome.  Good girls!  They have
3501,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"seated her and her things, planted a parasol to shelter her from the"
3502,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"wind, and lingered long enough not to make her feel herself turning"
3503,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,them out before making another settlement out of my sight.
3504,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3505,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,THREE O'CLOCK.--I am sorry to say Charley's sketch turned into a
3506,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,caricature of the unprotected female wandering in vain in search of
3507,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"a bit of shelter, with a torn parasol, a limp dress, and dragging"
3508,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"rug, and altogether unspeakably forlorn.  It was exhibited at the"
3509,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"dinner-table, and elicited peals of merriment, so that we elders"
3510,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,begged to see the cause of the young people's amusement.  My blood
3511,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"was up, and when I saw what it was, I said--"
3512,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3513,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""I wonder you like to record your own discourtesy, to call it"
3514,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"nothing worse."""
3515,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3516,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""But, Aunt Charlotte,"" said Metelill in her pretty pleading way, ""we"
3517,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"did not know her."""
3518,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3519,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""Well, what of that?"" I said."
3520,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3521,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""Oh, you know it is only abroad that people expect that sort of"
3522,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"things from strangers."""
3523,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3524,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""One of the worst imputations on English manners I ever heard,"" I"
3525,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,said.
3526,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3527,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""But she was such a guy!"" cried Charley.  ""Mother said she was sure"
3528,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"she was not a lady."""
3529,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3530,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""And therefore you did not show yourself one,"" I could not but"
3531,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,return.
3532,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3533,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,There her mother put in a gentle entreaty that Charley would not
3534,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"distress grandmamma with these loud arguments with her aunt, and I"
3535,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"added, seeing that Horace Druce's attention was attracted, that I"
3536,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"should like to have added another drawing called 'Courtesy,' and"
3537,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"shown that there was _SOME_ hospitality _EVEN_ to strangers, and"
3538,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,then I asked the two girls about her.  They had joined company
3539,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"again, and carried her beach-rest home for her, finding out by the"
3540,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,way that she was a poor homeless governess who had come down to stay
3541,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,in cheap lodgings with an old nurse to try to recruit herself till
3542,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"she could go out again.  My mother became immediately interested,"
3543,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and has sent Emily to call on her, and to try and find out whether"
3544,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,she is properly taken care of.
3545,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3546,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Isa was very much upset at my displeasure.  She came to me
3547,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,afterwards and said she was greatly grieved; but Metelill would not
3548,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"move, and she had always supposed it wrong to make acquaintance with"
3549,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,strangers in that chance way.  I represented that making room was
3550,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"not picking up acquaintance, and she owned it, and was really"
3551,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"grateful for the reproof; but, as I told her, no doubt such a rule"
3552,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,must be necessary in a place like Oxford.
3553,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3554,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,How curiously Christian courtesy and polished manners sometimes
3555,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,separate themselves! and how conceit interferes with both!  I acquit
3556,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Metelill and Isa of all but thoughtless habit, and Pica was"
3557,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,absorbed.  She can be well mannered enough when she is not defending
3558,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the rights of woman, or hotly dogmatical on the crude theories she"
3559,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"has caught--and suppose she has thought out, poor child!  And Jane,"
3560,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"though high-principled, kind, and self-sacrificing, is too narrow"
3561,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and--not exactly conceited--but exclusive and Bourne Parvaish, not"
3562,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to be as bad in her way, though it is the sound one.  The wars of"
3563,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the Druces and Maronites, as Martyn calls them, sometimes rage"
3564,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,beyond the bounds of good humour.
3565,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3566,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,TEN P.M.--I am vexed too on another score.  I must tell you that
3567,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"this hotel does not shine in puddings and sweets, and Charley has"
3568,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,not been ashamed to grumble beyond the bounds of good manners.  I
3569,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,heard some laughing and joking going on between the girls and the
3570,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"pupils, Metelill with her ""Oh no!  You won't!  Nonsense!"" in just"
3571,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"that tone which means ""I wish, I would, but I cannot bid you,""--the"
3572,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,tone I do not like to hear in a maiden of any degree.
3573,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3574,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,And behold three of those foolish lads have brought her gilt and
3575,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"painted boxes of bon-bons, over which there was a prodigious"
3576,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"giggling and semi-refusing and bantering among the young folks,"
3577,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"worrying Emily and me excessively, though we knew it would not do to"
3578,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,interfere.
3579,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3580,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,There is a sea-fog this evening unfavourable to the usual
3581,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"promenades, and we elders, including the tutor, were sitting with my"
3582,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"mother, when, in her whirlwind fashion, in burst Jane, dragging her"
3583,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"little sister Chattie with her, and breathlessly exclaiming,"
3584,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""Father, father, come and help!  They are gambling, and I can't get"
3585,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Meg away!"""
3586,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3587,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,When the nervous ones had been convinced that no one had been caught
3588,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"by the tide or fallen off the rocks, Jane explained that Metelill"
3589,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"had given one box of bon-bons to the children, who were to be served"
3590,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,with one apiece all round every day.  And the others were put up by
3591,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Metelill to serve as prizes in the 'racing game,' which some one had"
3592,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"routed out, left behind in the lodging, and which was now spread on"
3593,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the dining-table, with all the young people playing in high glee,"
3594,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and with immense noise.
3595,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3596,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""Betting too!"" said Jane in horror.  ""Mr. Elwood betted three"
3597,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"chocolate creams upon Charley, and Pica took it!  Father!  Come and"
3598,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"call Meg away."""
3599,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3600,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,She spoke exactly as if she were summoning him to snatch her sister
3601,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,from ROUGE ET NOIR at Monaco; and her face was indescribable when
3602,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"her aunt Edith set us all off laughing by saying, ""Fearful"
3603,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"depravity, my dear."""
3604,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3605,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""Won't you come, father?"" continued Jane; ""Mr. Methuen, won't you"
3606,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"come and stop those young men?"""
3607,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3608,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Mr. Methuen smiled a little and looked at Horace, who said--"
3609,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3610,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""Hush, Janie; these are not things in which to interfere."""
3611,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3612,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""Then,"" quoth Jane sententiously, ""I am not astonished at the"
3613,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"dissipation of the university."""
3614,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3615,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"And away she flounced in tears of wrath.  Her mother went after her,"
3616,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and we laughed a little, it was impossible to help it, at the bathos"
3617,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"of the chocolate creams; but, as Mr. Methuen said, she was really"
3618,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"right, the amusement was undesirable, as savouring of evil.  Edith,"
3619,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to my vexation, saw no harm in it; but Horace said very decidedly he"
3620,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"hoped it would not happen again; and Margaret presently returned,"
3621,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"saying she hoped that she had pacified Jane, and shown her that to"
3622,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,descend as if there were an uproar in the school would only do much
3623,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,more harm than was likely to happen in that one evening; and she
3624,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"said to me afterwards, ""I see what has been wanting in our training."
3625,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"We have let children's loyalty run into intolerance and rudeness."""
3626,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"But Meg was quite innocent of there being any harm in it, and only"
3627,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,needed reproof for being too much charmed by the pleasure for once
3628,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,to obey her dictatorial sister.
3629,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3630,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"13, TEN A.M.--Horace has had it out with sundry of the young ladies,"
3631,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"so as to prevent any more betting.  Several had regretted it.  ""Only"
3632,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,they did so want to get rid of the bon-bons!  And Jane did make such
3633,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"an uproar.""  After all, nobody did really bet but Charley and the"
3634,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"young Elwood, and Pica only that once.  Jane candidly owns that a"
3635,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,little gentleness would have made a difference.
3636,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3637,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Again I see this obtuseness to courtesy towards strangers.  Our
3638,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"despised church has become popular, and so many of the young folks"
3639,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,choose to accompany us that they overflowed into the free seats in
3640,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the aisle, where I had a full view of them from above.  These"
3641,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"benches are long, and I was sorry to see the girls planting"
3642,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"themselves fast at the outer end, and making themselves square, so"
3643,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"as to hinder any one else from getting in, till the verger came and"
3644,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"spoke to them, when Charley giggled offensively; and even then they"
3645,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"did not make room, but forced the people to squeeze past.  Isa could"
3646,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"not help herself, not being the outermost; but she was much"
3647,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"distressed, and does not shelter herself under Charley's plea that"
3648,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,it was so hot that the verger should have been indicted for cruelty
3649,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,to animals.  Certainly they all did come home very hot from walking
3650,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,back with the pupils.
3651,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3652,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Pica and Avice were not among them, having joined the Druces in"
3653,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"going to Hollyford, where Horace preached this morning.  Their gray"
3654,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"serges and sailor hats were, as they said, ""not adapted to the town"
3655,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"congregation."""
3656,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3657,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""It is the congregation you dress for?"" said their uncle dryly,"
3658,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,whereupon Pica upbraided him with inconsistency in telling his poor
3659,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"people not to use the excuse of 'no clothes,' and that the heart,"
3660,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"not the dress, is regarded.  He said it was true, but that he should"
3661,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,still advocate the poor man's coming in his cleanest and best.
3662,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""There are manners towards God as well as towards man,"" he said."
3663,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3664,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"I was too much tired by the heat to go to church again this evening,"
3665,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and am sitting with my mother, who is dozing.  Where the young"
3666,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"people are I do not know exactly, but I am afraid I hear Charley's"
3667,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,shrill laugh on the beach.
3668,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3669,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,14.--Who do you think has found us out?  Our dear old Governor-
3670,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"General, ""in all his laurels,"" as enthusiastic little Avice was"
3671,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"heard saying, which made Freddy stare hard and vainly in search of"
3672,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"them.  He is staying at Hollybridge Park, and seeing our name in the"
3673,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"S. Clements' list of visitors, he made Lady Hollybridge drive him"
3674,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"over to call, and was much disappointed to find that you could not"
3675,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"be here during his visit.  He was as kind and warm-hearted as ever,"
3676,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and paid our dear mother such compliments on her son, that we tell"
3677,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,her the bows on her cap are starting upright with pride.
3678,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3679,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Lady Hollybridge already knew Edith.  She made herself very
3680,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"pleasant, and insisted on our coming EN MASSE to a great garden"
3681,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,party which they are giving to-morrow.  Hollybridge is the S.
3682,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Clements' lion, with splendid grounds and gardens, and some fine old"
3683,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"pictures, so it is a fine chance for the young people; and we are"
3684,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"going to hire one of the large excursion waggonettes, which will"
3685,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"hold all who have age, dress, and will for gaieties.  The pupils, as"
3686,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Mr. Methuen is a friend of the Hollybridge people, will attend us as"
3687,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,outriders on their bicycles.  I am rather delighted at thus catching
3688,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,out the young ladies who did not think it worth while to bring a
3689,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Sunday bonnet.  They have all rushed into S. Clements to furbish
3690,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"themselves for the occasion, and we are left to the company of the"
3691,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"small Druces.  Neither Margaret nor Emily chooses to go, and will"
3692,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,keep my mother company.
3693,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3694,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,I ventured on administering a sovereign apiece to Isa and Jane
3695,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Druce.  The first blushed and owned that it was very welcome, as her"
3696,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,wardrobe had never recovered a great thunderstorm at Oxford.  Jane's
3697,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"awkwardness made her seem as if it were an offence on my part, but"
3698,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,her mother tells me it made her very happy.  Her father says that
3699,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"she tells him he was hard on Avice, a great favourite of his, and"
3700,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"that I must ask Jane to explain, for it is beyond him.  It is all"
3701,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"right about the Oxford girl.  I have engaged her, and she goes home"
3702,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,to-morrow to prepare herself.  This afternoon she is delighted to
3703,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,assist her young ladies in their preparations.  I liked her much in
3704,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,the private interview.  I was rather surprised to find that it was
3705,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"'Miss Avice,' of whom she spoke with the greatest fervour, as having"
3706,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"first made friends with her, and then having constantly lent her"
3707,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,books and read to her in her illness.
3708,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3709,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"15.--S.  Swithun is evidently going to be merciful to us to-day, and"
3710,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the damsels have been indefatigable--all, that is to say, but the"
3711,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"two Londoners, who have lawn tennis dresses, and their mother's maid"
3712,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,to turn them out complete.  Isa brought home some tulle and white
3713,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,jessamine with which she is deftly freshening the pretty compromise
3714,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,between a bonnet and a hat which she wears on Sunday; also a
3715,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"charming parasol, with a china knob and a wreath of roses at the"
3716,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"side.  She hopes I shall not think her extravagant, but she had a"
3717,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,little money of her own.
3718,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3719,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Jane Druce displays two pairs of gloves and two neckties for herself
3720,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and her sister; and after all Meg will not go; she is so uncouth
3721,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,that her mother does not like her to go without her own supervision;
3722,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and she with true Bourne Parva self-appreciation and exclusiveness
3723,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,says--
3724,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3725,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""I'm sure I don't want to go among a lot of stupid people, who care"
3726,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"for nothing but fine clothes and lawn tennis."""
3727,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3728,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,There was a light till one o'clock last night in the room where
3729,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Avice sleeps with Charley and the dog; and I scarcely saw either of
3730,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the Oxford sisters or Jane all this morning till dinner-time, when"
3731,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Pica appeared very appropriately to her name, turned out in an old"
3732,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"black silk dress left behind by her mother, and adorned with white"
3733,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"tulle in all sorts of folds, also a pretty white bonnet made up by"
3734,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Avice's clever fingers, and adorned with some soft gray sea-birds'"
3735,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,feathers and white down.  Isa and Metelill were very well got up and
3736,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"nice.  Metelill looks charming, but I am afraid her bouquet is from"
3737,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"one of those foolish pupils.  She, as usual, has shared it with Isa,"
3738,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"who has taken half to prevent her cousin being remarkable.  And,"
3739,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"after all, poor Avice is to be left behind.  There was no time to"
3740,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"make up things for two, and being in mourning, she could not borrow,"
3741,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,though Metelill would have been too happy to lend.  She says she
3742,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"shall be very happy with the children, but I can't help thinking"
3743,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,there was a tear in her eye when she ran to fetch her dress cloak
3744,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"for Jane, whom, by the bye, Avice has made wonderfully more like"
3745,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"other people.  Here is the waggonette, and I must finish to-morrow."
3746,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3747,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,16.--We have had a successful day.  The drive each way was a treat
3748,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"in itself, and the moon rising over the sea on our way home was a"
3749,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,sight never to be forgotten.  Hollybridge is charming in itself.
3750,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Those grounds with their sea-board are unique, and I never saw such"
3751,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Spanish chestnuts in England.  Then the gardens and the turf!  One
3752,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,must have lived as long in foreign parts as we have to appreciate
3753,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,the perfect finish and well-tended look of such places.  Your dear
3754,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"old chief does not quite agree.  He says he wants space, and is"
3755,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"oppressed with the sense of hedges and fences, except when he looks"
3756,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to the sea, and even there the rocks look polished off, and treated"
3757,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"by landscape gardeners!  He walked me about to see the show places,"
3758,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and look at the pictures, saying he had been so well lionised that"
3759,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,he wanted some one to discharge his information upon.  It was great
3760,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,fun to hear him criticising the impossibilities of a battle-piece--
3761,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Blenheim, I think--the anachronisms of the firearms and uniforms,"
3762,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and the want of discipline around Marlborough, who would never have"
3763,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,won a battle at that rate.  You know how his hawk's eye takes note
3764,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"of everything.  He looked at Metelill and said, ""Uncommonly pretty"
3765,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"girl that, and knows it,"" but when I asked what he thought of"
3766,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Isabel's looks, he said, ""Pretty, yes; but are you sure she is quite"
3767,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"aboveboard?  There's something I don't like about her eyes.""  I wish"
3768,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,he had not said so.  I know there is a kind of unfriendly feeling
3769,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"towards her among some of the girls, especially the Druces and"
3770,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Charley.  I have heard Charley openly call her a humbug, but I have"
3771,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"thought much of this was dislike to the softer manners, and perhaps"
3772,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"jealousy of my notice, and the expression that the old lord noticed"
3773,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,is often the consequence of living in an uncongenial home.
3774,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3775,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Of course my monopoly of the hero soon ended, and as I had no"
3776,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"acquaintances there, and the young ones had been absorbed into"
3777,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"games, or had fraternised with some one, I betook myself to"
3778,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"explorations in company with Jane, who had likewise been left out."
3779,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"After we had wandered along a dazzling stand of calceolarias, she"
3780,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"said, ""Aunt Charlotte, papa says I ought to tell you something; I"
3781,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"mean, why Avice could not come to-day, and why she has nothing to"
3782,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,wear but her round hat.  It is because she and Pica spent all they
3783,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,had in paying for that Maude Harris at the Convalescent Home.  They
3784,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,had some kind of flimsy gauzy bonnets that were faded and utterly
3785,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,done for after Commemoration week; and as Uncle Martyn is always
3786,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"growling about ladies' luggage, they thought it would be a capital"
3787,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"plan to go without all the time they are down here, till another"
3788,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,quarter is due.  Avice never thought of its not being right to go to
3789,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Church such a figure, and now she finds that papa thinks the command"
3790,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to ""have power on her head"" really may apply to that sort of"
3791,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"fashion, we are going to contrive something for Sunday, but it could"
3792,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"not be done in time for to-day.  Besides, she had no dress but a"
3793,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"serge."""
3794,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3795,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""She preferred dressing her sister to dressing herself,"" I answered;"
3796,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and Jane began assuring me that no one knew how unselfish that dear
3797,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"old Bird is.  The little money she had, she added to Pica's small"
3798,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"remnant, and thus enough had been provided to fit the elder sister"
3799,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,out.
3800,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3801,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""I suppose,"" I said, ""that Isa manages better, for she does not seem"
3802,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to be reduced to the same extremities, though I suppose she has less"
3803,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"allowance than her cousins."""
3804,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3805,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""She has exactly the same.  I know it.""  And Jane caught herself up,"
3806,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"evidently checking something I might have thought ill-natured, which"
3807,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"made me respond something intended to be moralising, but which was"
3808,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"perhaps foolish, about good habits of economy, and how this"
3809,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"disappointment, taken so good-humouredly, would be a lesson to"
3810,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Avice.  ""A lesson?  I should think so,"" said Jane bluntly.  ""A"
3811,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"lesson not to lend her money to Isa""; and then, when I asked what"
3812,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"she meant, she blurted out that all Isa's so-called share of the"
3813,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,subscription for Maude Harris had been advanced by Avice--Pica had
3814,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"told her so, with comments on her sister's folly in lending what she"
3815,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"well knew would never be repaid; and Alice could not deny it, only"
3816,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"defending herself by saying, she could not sacrifice the girl.  It"
3817,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"was a very uncomfortable revelation, considering that Isa might have"
3818,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"given her cousin my sovereign, but no doubt she did not think that"
3819,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"proper, as I had meant it to be spent for this outing."
3820,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3821,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"I will at least give her the benefit of the doubt, and I would not"
3822,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"encourage Jane to say any more about her.  Indeed, the girl herself"
3823,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,did not seem so desirous of dwelling on Isa as of doing justice to
3824,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Avice, whom, she told me very truly, I did not know.  ""She is always"
3825,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the one to give way and be put aside for Pie and Isa,"" said Jane."
3826,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"And now I think over the time we have had together, I believe it has"
3827,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"often been so.  ""You are very fond of her,"" I said; and Jane"
3828,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"answered, ""I should _THINK_ so!  Why, she spent eight months with us"
3829,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"once at Bourne Parva, just after the great row with Miss Hurlstone."
3830,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Oh, didn't you know?  They had a bad governess, who used to meet a"
3831,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"lover--a German musician, I think he was--when they were out"
3832,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"walking, and bullied Avice because she was honest.  When it all came"
3833,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to light, Pica came out and Isa was sent to school, but Avice had"
3834,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"got into a low state of health, and they said Oxford was not good"
3835,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"for her, so she came to us.  And papa prepared her for Confirmation,"
3836,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and she did everything with us, and she really is just like one of"
3837,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"ourselves,"" said Jane, as the highest praise imaginable, though any"
3838,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,one who contrasted poor Jane's stiff PIQUE (Miss Dadsworth's turn-
3839,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"out) with the grace even of the gray serge, might not think it a"
3840,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,compliment.  Jane was just beginning to tell me that Avice always
3841,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,wrote to her to lay before her father the difficulties about right
3842,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and wrong faith and practice that their way of life and habits of
3843,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"society bring before the poor child, when Isa descended upon us with"
3844,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""Oh! Aunt Charlotte, I could not think what had become of you, when"
3845,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"I saw the great man without you."""
3846,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3847,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"I begin to wonder whether she is really so very fond of me, or"
3848,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,whether she does not like to see me with one of the others.
3849,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3850,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"However, I shall be able to take Jane's hint, and cultivate Avice,"
3851,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"for, as my mother did not come yesterday, Lady Hollybridge has most"
3852,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,kindly insisted on her going over to-day.  The carriage is taking
3853,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"some one to the station, and is to call for her and me to bring us"
3854,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to luncheon, the kind people promising likewise to send us back.  So"
3855,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,I asked whether I might bring a niece who had not been able to come
3856,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"yesterday, and as the young people had, as usual, become enamoured"
3857,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"of Metelill, they begged for her likewise.  Avice looks very well in"
3858,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the dress she made up for Pica, and being sisters and in mourning,"
3859,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,the identity will only be natural.  She is very much pleased and
3860,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"very grateful, and declares that she shall see everything she cares"
3861,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"about much more pleasantly than in the larger party, and perhaps"
3862,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"'really hear the hero talk.'  And Uncle Horace says, ""True, you"
3863,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Bird, you are not like some young folk, who had rather hear"
3864,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"themselves talk than Socrates and S. Ambrose both at once.""  ""Oh!"""
3865,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"said saucy Pica, ""now we know what Uncle Horace thinks of his own"
3866,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"conversations with father!""  By the bye, Martyn and Mary come home"
3867,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to-morrow, and I am very glad of it, for those evening diversions on"
3868,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the beach go on in full force, and though there is nothing tangible,"
3869,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"except Charley's smoke, to object to, and it is the present way of"
3870,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"young people, there is something unsatisfactory in it.  Edith does"
3871,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,not seem to mind what her daughters do.  Margaret has no occasion to
3872,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"be uneasy about Jane, who always stays with the little ones while"
3873,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the maids are at supper, and generally takes with her the devoted"
3874,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Avice, who has some delicacy of throat forbidding these evening"
3875,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"excursions.  Meg gets more boisterous and noisy every day, Uchtred"
3876,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"being her chief companion; but as she is merely a tomboy, I believe"
3877,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,her parents think it inexpedient to give her hints that might only
3878,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,put fancies in her head.  So they have only prohibited learning to
3879,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"smoke, staying out later than nine o'clock, and shrieking louder"
3880,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,than a steam whistle!
3881,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3882,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"17.--Yesterday was a great success.  Avice was silent at first, but"
3883,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Metelill drew her out, and she had become quite at her ease before"
3884,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,we arrived.  You would have been enchanted to see how much was made
3885,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,of our dear mother.  Lord Hollybridge came out himself to give her
3886,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,his arm up the stone steps and across the slippery hall.  The good
3887,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"old chief talked to her by the hour about you, and Avice's eyes"
3888,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,shone all the time.  After luncheon our kind hostess arranged that
3889,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"dear mother should have half an hour's perfect rest, in a charming"
3890,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"little room fitted like a tent, and then had a low chair with two"
3891,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"little fairy ponies in it to drive her about the gardens, while I"
3892,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,walked with the two gentlemen and saw things much better than in the
3893,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"former hurly-burly, though that was a beautiful spectacle in its"
3894,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"way.  Avice, who has seen scores of FETES in college grounds, much"
3895,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"preferred the scenery, etc., in their natural state to a crowd of"
3896,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"strangers.  The young people took possession of the two girls, and"
3897,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"when we all met for the five o'clock tea, before going home, Lady"
3898,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Georgina eagerly told her father that Miss Fulford had made out the
3899,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"subject of 'that picture.'  It was a very beautiful Pre-Raffaelite,"
3900,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"of a lady gathering flowers in a meadow, and another in"
3901,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"contemplation, while a mysterious shape was at the back; the ladies"
3902,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"stiff-limbed but lovely faced, and the flowers--irises, anemones,"
3903,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"violets, and even the grass-blossom, done with botanical accuracy."
3904,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,A friend of Lord Hollybridge had picked it up for him in some
3905,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"obscure place in Northern Italy, and had not yet submitted it to an"
3906,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"expert.  Avice, it appeared, had recognised it as representing Leah"
3907,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and Rachel, as Action and Contemplation in the last books of Dante's"
3908,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"PURGATORIO, with the mystic griffin car in the distance.  Our hosts"
3909,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"were very much delighted; we all repaired to the picture, where she"
3910,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,very quietly and modestly pointed out the details.  A Dante was
3911,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"hunted up, but Lady Hollybridge and I were the only elders who knew"
3912,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"any Italian, and when the catalogue was brought, Avice knew all the"
3913,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"names of the translators, but as none were to be found, Lord"
3914,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Hollybridge asked if she would make him understand the passage,"
3915,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"which she did, blushing a little, but rendering it in very good"
3916,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"fluent English, so that he thanked her, and complimented her so much"
3917,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,that she was obliged to answer that she had got it up when they were
3918,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,hearing some lectures on Dante; and besides it was mentioned by
3919,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Ruskin; whereupon she was also made to find the reference, and mark"
3920,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,both it and Dante.
3921,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3922,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""I like that girl,"" said the old Governor-General, ""she is"
3923,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,intelligent and modest both.  There is something fine about the
3924,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"shape of her head."""
3925,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3926,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"When we went home, Metelill was as proud and delighted as possible"
3927,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,at what she called the Bird's triumph; but Avice did not seem at all
3928,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"elated, but to take her knowledge as a mere outcome of her ordinary"
3929,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Oxford life, where allusions, especially Ruskinese and Dantesque,"
3930,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"came naturally.  And then, as grandmamma went to sleep in her"
3931,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"corner, the two girls and I fell into a conversation on that whole"
3932,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,question of Action and Contemplation.  At least Metelill asked the
3933,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"explanation, but I doubt whether she listened much while Avice and I"
3934,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"talked out the matter, and I felt myself a girl again, holding the"
3935,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"old interminable talks with the first dear Avice, before you made"
3936,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"her my sister for those two happy years, and--Well, it is no use"
3937,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"paining you and myself with going back to those days, though there"
3938,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,was something in the earnest thoughtfulness and depth of her young
3939,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,namesake and godchild that carried me back to the choicest day of
3940,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,companionship before you came on the scene.  And to think what a
3941,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,jewel I have missed all this time!
3942,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3943,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"18.--I am deeply grieved, and am almost ashamed to write what I have"
3944,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,to tell you.  I had been out to see my mother with Margaret and
3945,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Emily settle in their favourite resort on the beach, and was coming"
3946,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"in to write my letters, when, in the sitting-room, which has open"
3947,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"French windows down to the ground, I heard an angry voice--"
3948,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3949,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""I tell you it was no joke.  It's no use saying so,"" and I beheld"
3950,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Charley and Isa in the midst of a violent quarrel.  ""I've looked on"
3951,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"at plenty of your dodges, sucking up to Aunt Charlotte to get taken"
3952,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,out with her; but when it comes to playing spiteful tricks on my
3953,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"sister I will speak out."""
3954,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3955,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"By this time I was on the window-step, checking Charley's very"
3956,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"improper tone, and asking what was the matter.  Isa sprang to me,"
3957,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,declaring that it was all Charley's absurd suspicion and
3958,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"misconstruction.  At last, amid hot words on both sides, I found"
3959,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"that Charley had just found, shut into a small album which Metelill"
3960,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"keeps upon the drawing-room table, a newly taken photograph of young"
3961,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Horne, one of the pupils, with a foolish devoted inscription upon"
3962,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the envelope, directed to Miss Fulford."
3963,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3964,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Isa protested that she had only popped it in to keep it safe until
3965,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"she could return it.  Charley broke out.  ""As if I did not know"
3966,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,better than that!  Didn't you make him give you that parasol and
3967,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"promise him your photo?  Ay, and give it him in return?  You thought"
3968,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"he would keep your secret, I suppose, but he tells everything, like"
3969,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"a donkey as he is, to Bertie Elwood, and Bertie and I have such fun"
3970,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"over him.  And now, because you are jealous of poor Metelill, and"
3971,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"think Aunt Charlotte may take a fancy to you instead of her, you are"
3972,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,sticking his photo into her book just to do her harm with the aunts.
3973,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,I'm not strait-laced.  I wouldn't mind having the photos of a
3974,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"hundred and fifty young men, only they would be horrid guys and all"
3975,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,just alike; but Aunt Charlotte is--is--well--a regular old maid
3976,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"about it, and you knew she would mind it, and so you did it on"
3977,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"purpose to upset Metelill's chances."""
3978,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3979,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Isa clung to me in floods of tears, desiring me not to believe"
3980,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"anything so cruel and false.  Every one always was so hard upon her,"
3981,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"she said, and she had only put the thing inadvertently there, to get"
3982,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"it out of sight, into the first book she saw, but unfortunately she"
3983,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,did not know I had heard her trying to pass it off to Charley as a
3984,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"jest.  However, as there was no proof there, I asked about the"
3985,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"parasol.  While the shopping was going on, she and young Horne had"
3986,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"been in another street, and this was the consequence!  I was"
3987,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,perfectly confounded.  Receive presents from young men!  It seemed
3988,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to me quite impossible.  ""Oh, Isa thinks nothing of that!"" said"
3989,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Charley.  ""Ask her where she got those bangles, and that bouquet"
3990,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"which she told you was half Metelill's.  You think me awful, I know,"
3991,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Aunt Charlotte, but I do draw a line, though I would never have said"
3992,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,one word about it if she had not played this nasty trick on
3993,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Metelill.""  Isa would have begun some imploring excuse, but our two"
3994,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"gentlemen were seen coming up towards the window, and she fled,"
3995,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,gasping out an entreaty that I would not tell Uncle Martyn.
3996,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
3997,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Nor did I then and there, for I needed to understand the matter and"
3998,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"look into it, so I told Martyn and Horace not to wait for me, and"
3999,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,heard Charley's story more coolly.  I had thought that Mr. Horne was
4000,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Metelill's friend.  ""So he was at first,"" Charley said, ""but he is"
4001,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"an uncommon goose, and Isa is no end of a hand at doing the pathetic"
4002,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"poverty-stricken orphan!  That's the way she gets so many presents!"""
4003,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Then she explained, in her select slang, that young Horne's love"
4004,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"affairs were the great amusement of his fellow-pupils, and that she,"
4005,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"being sure that the parasol was no present from me, as Isa had given"
4006,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the cousins to understand, had set Bertie Elwood to extract the"
4007,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"truth by teasing his friend.  ""But I never meant to have told,"" said"
4008,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Charley, ""if you had not come in upon us, when I was in the midst of"
4009,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"such a wax that I did not know what I was saying""; and on my"
4010,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,demanding what she meant by the elegant expression she had used
4011,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"about Isa and me, she explained that it was the schoolboy's word for"
4012,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"currying favour.  Every one but we stupid elders perceived the game,"
4013,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"nay, even the Druces, living in full confidence with their children,"
4014,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"knew what was going on.  I have never spoken, but somehow people"
4015,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"must read through one's brains, for there was a general conviction"
4016,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,that I was going to choose a niece to accompany us.  I wonder if
4017,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"you, my wise brother, let out anything to Edith.  It is what men"
4018,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"always do, they bind women to silence and then disclose the secret"
4019,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"themselves, and say, ""Nothing is safe with these women."""
4020,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
4021,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Any way, these girls have been generous, or else true to their"
4022,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"ESPRIT DE CORPS, I do not know which to call it; for though they"
4023,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,looked on at Isa's manoeuvres and my blindness with indignant
4024,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"contempt, they never attempted to interfere.  Jane Druce was seized"
4025,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"with a fit of passionate wrath and pity for me, but her father"
4026,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"withheld her from disclosures, assuring her that I should probably"
4027,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"find out the girl's true disposition, and that it would be wrong to"
4028,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,deprive Isa of a chance of coming under a fresh influence.
4029,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
4030,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Poor girl, she must be very clever, for she kept up her constant"
4031,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"wooing of me while she also coquetted with Mr. Horne, being really,"
4032,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"as her contemporaries declare, a much worse flirt than Metelill, but"
4033,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the temptation of the parasol threw her off her guard, and she was"
4034,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,very jealous of my taking out Metelill and Avice.  I see now that it
4035,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,has been her effort to keep the others away from me.  This spiteful
4036,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"trick, if it be true that she meant it, seems to have been done on"
4037,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Metelill, as being supposed to be her only real rival.  Avice always"
4038,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"yields to her, and besides, is too inoffensive to afford her any"
4039,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,such opportunity.
4040,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
4041,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"When I talked to Mary, she said, ""Oh yes, I always knew she was a"
4042,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"horrid little treacherous puss.  Nature began it, and that governess"
4043,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"worked on a ready soil.  We sent her to school, and hoped she was"
4044,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"cured, but I have long seen that it has only shown her how to be"
4045,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,more plausible.  But what can one do?  One could not turn out an
4046,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"orphan, and I did not see that she was doing our own girls any harm."
4047,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"I'm sure I gave her every chance of marrying, for there was nothing"
4048,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"I wished for so much, and I never told Martyn of her little"
4049,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"manoeuvres, knowing he would not stand them; and now what he will"
4050,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"do, I can't think, unless you and Edward will take her off our"
4051,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,hands.  I believe you might do her good.  She is an unfathomable
4052,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"mixture of sham and earnest, and she really likes you, and thinks"
4053,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"much of you, as having a certain prestige, and being a woman of the"
4054,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"world"" (fancy that).  ""Besides, she is really religious in a sort of"
4055,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"a way; much good you'll say it does her, but, as you know, there's a"
4056,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,certain sort of devotion which makes no difference to people's
4057,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"conduct."""
4058,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
4059,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,It seems to be the general desire of the family that we should take
4060,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,this unfortunate Isabel off their hands.  Shall we?  Cruelly as I
4061,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"have been disappointed in the girl, I can't help liking her; she is"
4062,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"obliging, pleasant, ladylike in manners, very affectionate, and I"
4063,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,can't help thinking that with the respect and fear for you she would
4064,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"feel she might be restrained, and that we could be the saving of"
4065,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"her, though at the same time I know that my having been so"
4066,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,egregiously deceived may be a sign that I am not fit to deal with
4067,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"her.  I leave it to your decision altogether, and will say no more"
4068,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"till I hear.  Metelill is a charming girl, and I fancy you prefer"
4069,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"her, and that her mother knows it, and would send her for at least a"
4070,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,winter; but she gets so entirely off her balance whenever a young
4071,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"man of any sort comes near, that I should not like to take charge of"
4072,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"her.  It might be good for the worthy Jane, but as she would take a"
4073,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"great deal of toning down and licking into shape, and as she would"
4074,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"despise it all, refer everything to the Bourne Parva standard, and"
4075,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"pine for home and village school, I don't think she need be"
4076,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"considered, especially as I am sure she would not go, and could not"
4077,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"be spared.  Pica would absorb herself in languages and antiquities,"
4078,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and maintain the rights of women by insisting on having full time to
4079,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"study her protoplasms, snubbing and deriding all the officers who"
4080,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,did not talk like Oxford dons.  Probably the E. E. would be the only
4081,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,people she would think fit to speak to.  Avice is the one to whom I
4082,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"feel the most drawn.  She is thoroughly thoughtful, and her religion"
4083,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,is not of the uninfluential kind Mary describes.  Those distresses
4084,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and perplexities which poor Isa affected were chiefly borrowed from
4085,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,her genuine ones; but she has obtained the high cultivation and
4086,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"intelligence that her Oxford life can give in full measure, and"
4087,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"without conceit or pretension, and it is her unselfish, yielding"
4088,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"spirit that has prevented me from knowing her sooner, though when"
4089,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"not suppressed she can be thoroughly agreeable, and take her part in"
4090,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"society with something of her mother's brilliancy.  I think, too,"
4091,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"that she would be spared, as Oxford does not agree with her, and a"
4092,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"southern winter or two would be very good for her.  Besides, the"
4093,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,others might come and see her in vacation time.  Could we not take
4094,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,both her and Isabel at least for the first winter?
4095,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
4096,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"19.--A stormy wet day, the first we have had.  Poor Isa has made an"
4097,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"attempt at explanation and apology, but lost herself in a mist of"
4098,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"words and tears.  I suppose I was severe, for she shrinks from me,"
4099,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and clings to Avice, who has stood her friend in many a storm"
4100,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"before, and, as Jane indignantly tells me, persists in believing"
4101,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,that she is really sorry and wishes to be good.  She is very
4102,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"attentive and obliging, and my dear mother, who is in happy"
4103,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"ignorance of all this uproar, really likes her the best of all the"
4104,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,girls.
4105,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
4106,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,21.--We have had a great alarm.  Last evening we went to the parish
4107,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"church; Horace Druce had been asked to preach, and the rain, which"
4108,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"had fallen all the morning, cleared off just in time for the walk."
4109,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Emily, Margaret, two of her children, and I sat in the gallery, and"
4110,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Avice and Isa in the free seats below.  Avice had been kept at home
4111,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"by the rain in the morning, but had begged leave to go later."
4112,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Darkness came on just as the first hymn was given out, and the"
4113,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,verger went round with his long wand lighting the gas.  In the
4114,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"gallery we saw plainly how, at the east end, something went wrong"
4115,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"with his match, one which he thought had failed, and threw aside."
4116,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"It fell on a strip of straw matting in the aisle, which, being very"
4117,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"dry, caught fire and blazed up for a few seconds before it was"
4118,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"trampled out.  Some foolish person, however, set the cry of 'Fire!'"
4119,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"going, and you know what that is in a crowded church.  The vicar, in"
4120,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"his high old-fashioned desk with a back to it, could not see."
4121,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Horace in a chair, in the narrow, shallow sanctuary, did see that it"
4122,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"was nothing, but between the cries of 'Fire!' and the dying peal of"
4123,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the organ, could not make his voice heard.  All he could do was to"
4124,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"get to the rear of the crowd, together with the other few who had"
4125,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"seen the real state of things, and turn back all those whom they"
4126,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"could, getting them out through the vestry.  But the main body were"
4127,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"quite out of their reach, and everybody tried to rush scrambling"
4128,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"into the narrow centre aisle, choking up the door, which was a"
4129,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,complicated trap meant to keep out draughts.  We in the gallery
4130,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"tried vainly to assure them that the only danger was in the crowd,"
4131,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and the clergyman in his desk, sure that was the chief peril, at any"
4132,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"rate, went on waving and calling to them to wait; but the cries and"
4133,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"shrieks drowned everything, and there was a most terrible time, as"
4134,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"some 600 people jammed themselves in that narrow space, fighting,"
4135,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"struggling, fainting."
4136,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
4137,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,You may suppose how we watched our girls.  They had let themselves
4138,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,be thrust up to the end of the seat by later comers:  Avice the
4139,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"innermost.  We saw them look up to us, with white faces.  To our"
4140,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"joy, Avice seemed to understand our signs and to try to withhold"
4141,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Isa, but she was too wild with fright not to try to push on to the"
4142,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"end of the pew.  Avice held her dress, and kept her back.  Then, as"
4143,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the crowd swayed, the two girls stood on the seat, and presently I"
4144,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"saw Avice bend down, and take from some one's arms a little child,"
4145,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"which she seated on the edge of the pew, holding it in her arms, and"
4146,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"soothing it.  I don't know how long it all lasted, Horace says it"
4147,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,was not ten minutes before he had got men and tools to break down
4148,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the obstruction at the door, and pull out the crowded, crushed"
4149,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"people, but to us it seemed hours.  They were getting calmer too in"
4150,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the rear, for many had followed the lead through the vestry door,"
4151,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and others had found out that there was no fire at all.
4152,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
4153,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Wonderful to tell, no one was killed.  There were some broken arms,"
4154,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"three I think, and some bad bruises.  Many people were fainting, and"
4155,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"much hurt by the horrible heat and crush, but when at last the way"
4156,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"was free, we saw Horace come into the church, looking about in great"
4157,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"anxiety for the two girls, whom he had failed to find in the"
4158,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"trampled multitude.  Then Avice came up to him, with the child in"
4159,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"her arms, and Isa followed, quite safe!  How thankful we all were!"
4160,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Avice says she remembered at once that she had been told of the
4161,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,American fireman's orders to his little girl always to keep still in
4162,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"such an alarm, for the crowd was a worse peril than the fire.  By"
4163,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"the time we had come down the stairs and joined them, the child's"
4164,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"father had come for it in great anxiety, for its sister had been"
4165,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"trampled down fainting, and had just only revived enough to miss it!"
4166,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,I shall never forget what it was to see people sucked down in that
4167,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"surging mass, and the thankful thrill of seeing our girls standing"
4168,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"there quietly with the child between them, its little fair head on"
4169,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,Avice's breast.  We went home quietly and thankfully.  Horace took
4170,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Avice to the hotel that he might explain all to her parents, and let"
4171,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"them know how well she had behaved; Isabel was shaken and tearful,"
4172,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and her voice sounded weak and nervous as she bade her cousin good-
4173,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,night and embraced her with much agitation.  So I went to her room
4174,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"to see whether she needed any doctoring, but I found Metelill"
4175,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"soothing her nicely, so I only kissed her (as I had not done these"
4176,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"two nights).  ""Ah, dear aunt, you forgive me!"" she said.  The tone"
4177,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"threw me back, as if she were making capital of her adventure, and I"
4178,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"said, ""You have not offended _ME_.""  ""Ah! you are still angry, and"
4179,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"yet you _DO_ love me still a little,"" she said, not letting me go."
4180,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"""The more love, the more grief for your having done wrong,"" I said;"
4181,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"and she returned, ""Ah! if I always had you.""  That chilled me, and I"
4182,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,went away.  She does not know the difference between pardon and
4183,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,remission of consequences.  One must have something of the spirit of
4184,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,the fifty-first Psalm before that perception comes.  Poor dear
4185,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"child, how one longs for power to breathe into her some such"
4186,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,penitence!
4187,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,
4188,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"Avice is quite knocked up to-day, and her mother has kept her in"
4189,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"bed, where she is very happy with her Jane.  I have been to see her,"
4190,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,and she has been thanking me for having suggested the making way for
4191,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,"fresh comers in a pew.  Otherwise, she says, she could not have"
4192,CHARLOTTE FULFORD.,withstood the rush.

4197,22D JULY.,
4198,22D JULY.,"My Dear Charlotte,--I decidedly object to the company of a young"
4199,22D JULY.,lady with such a genius for intrigue as Isabel Fulford seems to
4200,22D JULY.,"possess.  If we had only ourselves to consider, no doubt it would be"
4201,22D JULY.,"well for you to take her in hand, but in the sort of house ours will"
4202,22D JULY.,"be, there must be no one we cannot depend upon in our own family."
4203,22D JULY.,
4204,22D JULY.,I suppose I am guilty of having betrayed my thoughts to Edith.  I
4205,22D JULY.,"had certainly wished for Metelill.  She is an engaging creature, and"
4206,22D JULY.,I am sorry you take so adverse a view of her demeanour; but I
4207,22D JULY.,promised to abide by your judgment and I will not question it.  We
4208,22D JULY.,"will ask Arthur and Edith to bring her to visit us, and then perhaps"
4209,22D JULY.,you may be better satisfied with her.
4210,22D JULY.,
4211,22D JULY.,"The learned young lady is out of the question, and as Avice is my"
4212,22D JULY.,"dear wife's godchild as well as mine, I am very glad she has"
4213,22D JULY.,deserved that your choice should fall upon her.  It seems as if you
4214,22D JULY.,"would find in her just the companionship you wish, and if her health"
4215,22D JULY.,"needs the southern climate, it is well to give her the opportunity."
4216,22D JULY.,"You had better propose the scheme at once, and provide what she will"
4217,22D JULY.,need for an outfit.  The last touches might be given at Paris.  I
4218,22D JULY.,"hope to get time to run down to New Cove next week, and if you and"
4219,22D JULY.,"the niece can be ready to start by the middle of August, we will"
4220,22D JULY.,"take Switzerland by the way, and arrive at Malta by the end of"
4221,22D JULY.,September.
4222,22D JULY.,
4223,22D JULY.,I shall be curious to hear the result of your throwing the

4229,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD
4230,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,
4231,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,JULY 24.--I threw the handkerchief by asking Martyn and Mary to
4232,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"spare their daughter.  Tears came into Mary's eyes, the first I ever"
4233,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"saw there, and she tried in vain to say something ridiculous."
4234,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"Martyn walked to the window and said huskily, ""Dr. A--- said it"
4235,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,would confirm her health to spend a few winters in the South.  Thank
4236,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"you, Charlotte!""  They did not doubt a moment, but Martyn feels the"
4237,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"parting more than I ever thought he would, and Pica and Uchtred go"
4238,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"about howling and bewailing, and declaring that they never shall"
4239,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,know where to find anything again.
4240,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,
4241,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"Avice herself is much more sorrowful than glad, though she is too"
4242,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,courteous and grateful not to show herself gracious to me.  She did
4243,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"entreat me to take Isa instead, so earnestly that I was obliged to"
4244,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"read her your decided objections.  It was a blow to her at first,"
4245,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,but she is rapidly consoling herself over the wonderful commissions
4246,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"she accepts.  She is to observe Mediterranean zoophytes, and send"
4247,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,them home on glass slides for the family benefit.  She is to send
4248,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"her father photographs and drawings to illustrate his lectures, and"
4249,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"Jane has begged for a pebble or rock from S. Paul's Bay, to show to"
4250,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"her class at school.  Indeed, I believe Avice is to write a special"
4251,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"journal, to be published in the BOURNE PARVA PARISH MAGAZINE;"
4252,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"Charley begs for a sea-horse, and Freddy has been instructed by one"
4253,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,of the pupils to bargain for nothing less than the Colossus of
4254,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"Rhodes; Metelill is quite as cordial in her rejoicing, and Edith"
4255,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"owns that, now it has come to the point, she is very glad to keep"
4256,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,her daughter.
4257,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,
4258,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"And Isa?  Well, she is mortified, poor child.  I think she must have"
4259,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"cried bitterly over the disappointment, for she looked very wretched"
4260,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,when we met at dinner.
4261,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,
4262,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"Meanwhile, Martyn had a walk with Emily, who found that he was very"
4263,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"sorry not to be relieved from Isabel, though he knew you were quite"
4264,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,right not to take her.  He thought Oxford not a good place for such
4265,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"a girl, and the absence of the trustworthy Avice would make things"
4266,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,worse.  Then Emily proposed to take Isabel back to the Birchwood
4267,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"with her.  Grandmamma really likes the girl, who is kind and"
4268,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"attentive.  There are no young people to whom she could do harm,"
4269,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"Emily can look after her, and will be glad of help and"
4270,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,companionship.  The whole family council agreed that it will be a
4271,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"really charitable work, and that if any one can do her good, it will"
4272,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,be the mother and Aunt Emily.
4273,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,
4274,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,Isa has acquiesced with an overflow of gratitude and affection to
4275,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"them for taking pity on her.  It sounds a little fulsome, but I"
4276,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,believe some of it is genuine.  She is really glad that some one
4277,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"wishes for her, and I can quite believe that she will lose in Avice"
4278,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,all that made life congenial to her under Mary's brisk
4279,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,uncompromising rule.  If she can only learn to be true--true to
4280,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"herself and to others--she will yet be a woman to love and esteem,"
4281,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,and at Birchwood they will do their best to show that religious
4282,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,sentiment must be connected with Truth.
4283,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,
4284,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"And so ends my study of the manners of my nieces, convincing me the"
4285,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"more that as the manners are, so is the man or woman.  The heart, or"
4286,MISS FULFORD TO SIR EDWARD FULFORD,"rather the soul, forms the manners, and they _ARE_ the man."

4301,COME TO HER KINGDOM,progeny after the fashion of old ewes with their lambs; Susan
4302,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Merrifield in a huge, carefully preserved brown mushroom hat, with a"

4307,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the bells had been ringing fitfully all day, and had just burst out"

4312,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'A tricycle!' exclaimed the Vicar.

4314,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'A woman!  Oh!' cried Susan in horror, 'and she's stopping--at the"

4326,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4327,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Hark! here's something coming.'
4328,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4329,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"The Bonchamp fly came rattling up, loaded with luggage, and with a"
4330,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"quiet lady in black seated in it, which stopped at the same gate."
4331,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4332,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'The obedient mother, no doubt,' said Elizabeth.  'She looks like a"
4333,COME TO HER KINGDOM,lady.'
4334,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4335,COME TO HER KINGDOM,There had been a good deal of excitement at Stokesley about the
4336,COME TO HER KINGDOM,property known by the pleasing name of the Gap.  An old gentleman
4337,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"had lived there for many years, always in a secluded state, and"
4338,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"latterly imbecile, and on his death in the previous year no one had"
4339,COME TO HER KINGDOM,for some time appeared as heir; but it became known that the
4340,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"inheritrix was a young lady, a great-niece, living with a widowed"
4341,COME TO HER KINGDOM,mother in one of the large manufacturing towns in the north of
4342,COME TO HER KINGDOM,England.  Her father had been a clergyman and had died when she was
4343,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"an infant.  That was all that was known, and as the house had become"
4344,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"almost uninhabitable, the necessary repairs had prevented the"
4345,COME TO HER KINGDOM,heiress from taking possession all this time.  It was not a very
4346,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"large inheritance, only comprising a small farm, the substantial"
4347,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"village shop, four or five cottages, and a moderate-sized house and"
4348,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"grounds, where the neglected trees had grown to strange irregular"
4349,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"proportions, equally with the income, which, owing to the outgoings"
4350,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"being small, had increased to about 800 or 900 pounds a year, and of"
4351,COME TO HER KINGDOM,course it was a subject of much anxiety with Admiral Merrifield's
4352,COME TO HER KINGDOM,family to know what sort of people the newcomers would prove.
4353,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4354,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Of the large family only the two eldest daughters were at home;
4355,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Susan, now nearly forty, had never left it, but had been the"
4356,COME TO HER KINGDOM,daughter-of-all-work at home and lady-of-all-work to the parish ever
4357,COME TO HER KINGDOM,since she had emerged from the schoolroom; her apricot complexion
4358,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"showing hardly any change, and such as there was never perceived by"
4359,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"her parents.  The Admiral, still a light, wiry, hale man, as active"
4360,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"as ever, with his hands full of county, parish, and farming"
4361,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"business; an invalid for many years, but getting into that health"
4362,COME TO HER KINGDOM,which is LA JEUNESSE DE LA VIEILLESSE.
4363,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4364,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Elizabeth had, from twenty-five to thirty-two, been spared from home"
4365,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"by her father to take care of his stepmother in London, where she"
4366,COME TO HER KINGDOM,had beguiled her time with a certain amount of authorship under a
4367,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"NOM DE PLUME, and had been introduced to some choice society both"
4368,COME TO HER KINGDOM,through her literary abilities and her family connections.
4369,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4370,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Four years previous the old lady had died, leaving her a legacy,"
4371,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"which, together with her gains, would have enabled her to keep such"
4372,COME TO HER KINGDOM,a home in town as to remain in touch with the world to which she had
4373,COME TO HER KINGDOM,been introduced; but she had never lost her Stokesley heart enough
4374,COME TO HER KINGDOM,for the temptation to outweigh the disappointment she would have
4375,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"caused at home, and the satisfaction and rest of being among her own"
4376,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"people.  So she only went up for an occasional visit, and had become"
4377,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the brightness of the house, and Susan's beloved partner in all her"
4378,COME TO HER KINGDOM,works.
4379,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4380,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Her father, who understood better than did her mother and sister"
4381,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"what she had given up, had insisted on her having a sitting-room to"
4382,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"herself, which she embellished with the personal possessions she had"
4383,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"accumulated, and where she pursued her own avocations in the"
4384,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"forenoon, often indeed interrupted, but never showing, and not often"
4385,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"feeling, that it was to her hindrance, and indeed the family looked"
4386,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"on her work sufficiently as a profession, not only to acquiesce, but"
4387,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"to have a certain complacency in it, though it was a kind of"
4388,COME TO HER KINGDOM,transparent fiction that MESA was an anagram of her initials and
4389,COME TO HER KINGDOM,that of Stokesley.  Her mother at any rate believed that none of the
4390,COME TO HER KINGDOM,neighbours guessed at any such thing.
4391,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4392,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Stokesley was a good deal out of the world, five miles from the"
4393,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"station at Bonchamp, over hilly, stony roads, so that the cyclist"
4394,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"movement had barely reached it; the neighbourhood was sparse, and"
4395,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Mrs. Merrifield's health had not been conducive to visiting, any"
4396,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"more than was her inclination, so that there was a little agitation"
4397,COME TO HER KINGDOM,about first calls.
4398,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4399,COME TO HER KINGDOM,The newcomers appeared at church on Sunday at all the services.  A
4400,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"bright-faced girl of one-and-twenty, with little black eyes like"
4401,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"coals of fire, a tight ulster, like a riding habit, and a small"
4402,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"billycock hat, rather dismayed those who still held that bonnets"
4403,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"ought to be the Sunday gear of all beyond childhood; but the mother,"
4404,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"in rich black silk, was unexceptionable."
4405,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4406,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Refusing to be marshalled up the aisle to the seat which persistent
4407,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"tradition assigned to the Gap in the aristocratic quarter, daughter"
4408,COME TO HER KINGDOM,and mother (it was impossible not thus to call them) sat themselves
4409,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"down on the first vacant place, close to a surviving white smock-"
4410,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"frock, and blind to the bewildered glances of his much-bent friend"
4411,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"in velveteen, who, hobbling in next after, found himself displaced"
4412,COME TO HER KINGDOM,and separated alike from his well-thumbed prayer and hymn book and
4413,COME TO HER KINGDOM,the companion who found the places for him.
4414,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4415,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'It ain't fitty like,' said the old man confidentially to Susan,"
4416,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'nor the ladies wouldn't like it when we comes in with our old coats
4417,COME TO HER KINGDOM,all of a muck with wet.'
4418,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4419,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'The principle is right,' said Bessie, when this was repeated to"
4420,COME TO HER KINGDOM,her; 'but practice ought to wait till native manners and customs are
4421,COME TO HER KINGDOM,learnt.'
4422,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4423,COME TO HER KINGDOM,The two sisters offered to save their mother the first visit--leave
4424,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"her card, or make her excuses; but Mrs. Merrifield held that a card"
4425,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"thus left savoured of deceit, and that the deed must be womanfully"
4426,COME TO HER KINGDOM,done in person.  But she would not wait till the horses could be
4427,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"spared, saying that for near village neighbours it was more friendly"
4428,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"to go down in her donkey-chair; and so she did, Bessie driving her,"
4429,COME TO HER KINGDOM,and the Admiral walking with them.
4430,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4431,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"The Gap had, ever since Bessie could remember, been absolutely"
4432,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"shrouded in trees, its encircling wall hidden in ivy bushes, over"
4433,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"which laburnums, lilacs, pink thorns, and horse chestnuts towered;"
4434,COME TO HER KINGDOM,and the drive from the seldom-opened gate was almost obstructed by
4435,COME TO HER KINGDOM,the sweeping arms of laurels and larches.
4436,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4437,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"It was obstructed now, but by these same limbs lying amputated; and"
4438,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'chop, chop!' was heard in the distance."
4439,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4440,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh, the Arbutus!' sighed Bessie."
4441,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4442,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Clearing was much needed,' said her father, with a man's propensity"
4443,COME TO HER KINGDOM,for the axe.
4444,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4445,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"The donkey, however, thought it uncanny, 'upon the pivot of his"
4446,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"skull, turned round his long left ear,' and planted his feet firmly."
4447,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Mrs. Merrifield, deprecating the struggle by which her husband would"
4448,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"on such occasions enforce discipline, begged to get out; and while"
4449,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"this was going on, the ulstered young lady, with a small axe in"
4450,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"hand, came, as it were, to the rescue, and, while the donkey was"
4451,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"committed to a small boy, explained hastily, 'So overgrown, there is"
4452,COME TO HER KINGDOM,nothing to be done but to let in light and air.  My mother is at
4453,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"home,' she added; 'she will be happy to see you,' and, conducting"
4454,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"them in with complete self-possession--rather, as it occurred to"
4455,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Bessie, as the Queen might have led the way to the Duchess of Kent,"
4456,COME TO HER KINGDOM,though there was a perfect simplicity and evident enjoyment about
4457,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"her that was very prepossessing, and took off the edge of the sense"
4458,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"of conceit.  Besides, the palace was, to London eyes at least, so"
4459,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"little to boast of, with the narrow little box of a wooden porch,"
4460,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the odd, one-sided vestibule, and the tiny anteroom with the worn"
4461,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"carpet; but the drawing-room, in spite of George IV furniture, was"
4462,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"really pretty, with French windows opening on a well-mown lawn, and"
4463,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"fresh importations of knick-knacks, and vases of wild flowers, which"
4464,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"made it look inhabited and pleasant.  There was no one there, and"
4465,COME TO HER KINGDOM,the young lady proceeded to fetch her mother; and the unguarded
4466,COME TO HER KINGDOM,voice was caught by Bessie's quick ears from the window.
4467,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4468,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Here are Admiral and Mrs. Merrifield, and one daughter.  Come"
4469,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"along, little mammy!  Worthy, homely old folks--just in your line.'"
4470,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4471,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"To Bessie's relief, she perceived that this was wholly unheard by"
4472,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"her father and mother.  And there was no withstanding the eager,"
4473,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"happy, shy looks of the mother, whose whole face betrayed that after"
4474,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"many storms she had come into a haven of peace, and that she was"
4475,COME TO HER KINGDOM,proud to owe it to her daughter.
4476,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4477,COME TO HER KINGDOM,A few words showed that mother and daughter were absolutely
4478,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"enchanted with Stokesley, their own situation, and one another--the"
4479,COME TO HER KINGDOM,young lady evidently all the more because she perceived so much to
4480,COME TO HER KINGDOM,be done.
4481,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4482,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Everything wants improving.  It is so choked up,' she said, 'one"
4483,COME TO HER KINGDOM,wants to let in the light.'
4484,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4485,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'There are a good many trees,' said the Admiral, while Bessie"
4486,COME TO HER KINGDOM,suspected that she meant figuratively as well as literally; and as
4487,COME TO HER KINGDOM,the damsel was evidently burning to be out at her clearing
4488,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"operations again, and had never parted with her axe, the Admiral"
4489,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"offered to go with her and tell her about the trees, for, as he"
4490,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"observed, she could hardly judge of those not yet out in leaf."
4491,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4492,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"She accepted him, though Bessie shrewdly suspected that the advice"
4493,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"would be little heeded, and, not fancying the wet grass and"
4494,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"branches, nor the demolition of old friends, she did not follow the"
4495,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"pair, but effaced herself, and listened with much interest to the"
4496,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"two mothers, who sat on the sofa with their heads together.  Either"
4497,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Mrs. Merrifield was wonderful in inspiring confidence, or it was"
4498,COME TO HER KINGDOM,only too delightful to Mrs. Arthuret to find a listener of her own
4499,COME TO HER KINGDOM,standing to whom to pour forth her full heart of thankfulness and
4500,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"delight in her daughter.  'Oh, it is too much!' occurred so often in"
4501,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"her talk that, if it had not been said with liquid eyes, choking"
4502,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"voice, and hands clasped in devout gratitude, it would have been"
4503,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"tedious; but Mrs. Merrifield thoroughly went along with it, and was"
4504,COME TO HER KINGDOM,deeply touched.
4505,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4506,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"The whole story, as it became known, partly in these confidences,"
4507,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"partly afterwards, was this.  The good lady, who had struck the"
4508,COME TO HER KINGDOM,family at first as a somewhat elderly mother for so young a
4509,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"daughter, had been for many years a governess, engaged all the time"
4510,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"to a curate, who only obtained a small district incumbency in a"
4511,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"town, after wear and tear, waiting and anxiety, had so exhausted him"
4512,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"that the second winter brought on bronchitis, and he scarcely lived"
4513,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"to see his little daughter, Arthurine.  The mother had struggled on"
4514,COME TO HER KINGDOM,upon a pittance eked out with such music teaching as she could
4515,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"procure, with her little girl for her sole care, joy, and pride--a"
4516,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"child who, as she declared, had never given her one moment's pang or"
4517,COME TO HER KINGDOM,uneasiness.
4518,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4519,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Poor mamma, could she say that of any one of her nine?' thought"
4520,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Bessie; and Mrs. Merrifield made no such attempt.
4521,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4522,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Arthurine had brought home all prizes, all distinctions at the High"
4523,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"School, but--here was the only disappointment of her life--a low"
4524,COME TO HER KINGDOM,fever had prevented her trying for a scholarship at Girton.  In
4525,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"consideration, however, of her great abilities and high qualities,"
4526,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"as well as out of the great kindness of the committee, she had been"
4527,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"made an assistant to one of the class mistresses, and had worked on"
4528,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"with her own studies, till the wonderful tidings came of the"
4529,COME TO HER KINGDOM,inheritance that had fallen to her quite unexpectedly; for since her
4530,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"husband's death Mrs. Arthuret had known nothing of his family, and"
4531,COME TO HER KINGDOM,while he was alive there were too many between him and the
4532,COME TO HER KINGDOM,succession for the chance to occur to him as possible.  The relief
4533,COME TO HER KINGDOM,and blessing were more than the good lady could utter.  All things
4534,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"are comparative, and to one whose assured income had been 70 pounds"
4535,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"a year, 800 pounds was unbounded wealth; to one who had spent her"
4536,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"life in schoolrooms and lodgings, the Gap was a lordly demesne."
4537,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4538,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'And what do you think was the first thing my sweet child said?'
4539,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"added Mrs. Arthuret, with her eyes glittering through tears."
4540,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Mammy, you shall never hear the scales again, and you shall have"
4541,COME TO HER KINGDOM,the best Mocha coffee every day of your life.'
4542,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4543,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Bessie felt that after this she must like the sweet child, though"
4544,COME TO HER KINGDOM,sweetness did not seem to her the predominant feature in Arthurine.
4545,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4546,COME TO HER KINGDOM,After the pathos to which she had listened there was somewhat of a
4547,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"comedy to come, for the ladies had spent the autumn abroad, and had"
4548,COME TO HER KINGDOM,seen and enjoyed much.  'It was a perfect feast to see how Arthurine
4549,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"entered into it all,' said the mother.  'She was never at a loss,"
4550,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"and explained it all to me.  Besides, perhaps you have seen her"
4551,COME TO HER KINGDOM,article?'
4552,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4553,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'I beg your pardon.'
4554,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4555,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Her article in the KENSINGTON.  It attracted a great deal of
4556,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"attention, and she has had many compliments.'"
4557,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4558,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh! the KENSINGTON MAGAZINE,' said Mrs. Merrifield, rather"
4559,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"uneasily, for she was as anxious that Bessie should not be suspected"
4560,COME TO HER KINGDOM,of writing in the said periodical as the other mother was that
4561,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Arthurine should have the fame of her contributions.
4562,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4563,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Do you take it?' asked Mrs. Arthuret, 'for we should be very glad"
4564,COME TO HER KINGDOM,to lend it to you.'
4565,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4566,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"A whole pile was on the table, and Mrs. Merrifield looked at them"
4567,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"with feeble thanks and an odd sort of conscious dread, though she"
4568,COME TO HER KINGDOM,could with perfect truth have denied either 'taking it' or reading
4569,COME TO HER KINGDOM,it.
4570,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4571,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Bessie came to her relief.  'Thank you,' she said; 'we do; some of"
4572,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"us have it.  Is your daughter's article signed A. A., and doesn't it"
4573,COME TO HER KINGDOM,describe a boarding-house on the Italian lakes?  I thought it very
4574,COME TO HER KINGDOM,clever and amusing.'
4575,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4576,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Mrs. Arthuret's face lighted up.  'Oh yes, my dear,' slipped out in"
4577,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"her delight.  'And do you know, it all came of her letter to one of"
4578,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the High School ladies, who is sister to the sub-editor, such a"
4579,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"clever, superior girl!  She read it to the headmistress and all, and"
4580,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"they agreed that it was too good to be lost, and Arthurine copied it"
4581,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"out and added to it, and he--Mr. Jarrett--said it was just what he"
4582,COME TO HER KINGDOM,wanted--so full of information and liveliness--and she is writing
4583,COME TO HER KINGDOM,some more for him.'
4584,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4585,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Mrs. Merrifield was rather shocked, but she felt that she herself"
4586,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"was in a glass house, was, in fact, keeping a literary daughter, so"
4587,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"she only committed herself to, 'She is very young.'"
4588,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4589,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Only one-and-twenty,' returned Mrs. Arthuret triumphantly; 'but"
4590,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"then she has had such advantages, and made such use of them."
4591,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Everything seems to come at once, though, perhaps, it is unthankful"
4592,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"to say so.  Of course, it is no object now, but I could not help"
4593,COME TO HER KINGDOM,thinking what it would have been to us to have discovered this
4594,COME TO HER KINGDOM,talent of hers at the time when we could hardly make both ends
4595,COME TO HER KINGDOM,meet.'
4596,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4597,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'She will find plenty of use for it,' said Mrs. Merrifield, who, as"
4598,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the wife of a country squire and the mother of nine children, did"
4599,COME TO HER KINGDOM,not find it too easy to make her ends meet upon a larger income.
4600,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4601,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh yes! indeed she will, the generous child.  She is full of plans"
4602,COME TO HER KINGDOM,for the regeneration of the village.'
4603,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4604,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Poor Mrs. Merrifield! this was quite too much for her.  She thought
4605,COME TO HER KINGDOM,it irreverent to apply the word in any save an ecclesiastical sense;
4606,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"nor did she at all desire to have the parish, which was considered"
4607,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"to be admirably worked by the constituted authorities,"
4608,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'regenerated,' whatever that might mean, by a young lady of one-and-"
4609,COME TO HER KINGDOM,twenty.  She rose up and observed to her daughter that she saw papa
4610,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"out upon the lawn, and she thought it was time to go home."
4611,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4612,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Mrs. Arthuret came out with them, and found what Bessie could only"
4613,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"regard as a scene of desolation.  Though gentlemen, as a rule, have"
4614,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"no mercy on trees, and ladies are equally inclined to cry, 'Woodman,"
4615,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"spare that tree,' the rule was reversed, for Miss Arthuret was"
4616,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"cutting, and ordering cutting all round her ruthlessly with"
4617,COME TO HER KINGDOM,something of the pleasure of a child in breaking a new toy to prove
4618,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"that it is his own, scarcely listening when the Admiral told her"
4619,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"what the trees were, and how beautiful in their season; while even"
4620,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"as to the evergreens, she did not know a yew from a cedar, and"
4621,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"declared that she must get rid of this horrid old laurustinus, while"
4622,COME TO HER KINGDOM,she lopped away at a Portugal laurel.  Her one idea seemed to be
4623,COME TO HER KINGDOM,that it was very unwholesome to live in a house surrounded with
4624,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"trees; and the united influence of the Merrifields, working on her"
4625,COME TO HER KINGDOM,mother by representing what would be the absence of shade in a few
4626,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"months' time, barely availed to save the life of the big cedar;"
4627,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"while the great rhododendron, wont to present a mountain of shining"
4628,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"leaves and pale purple blossoms every summer, was hewn down without"
4629,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"remorse as an awful old laurel, and left a desolate brown patch in"
4630,COME TO HER KINGDOM,its stead.
4631,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4632,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Is it an emblem,' thought Bessie, 'of what she would like to do to"
4633,COME TO HER KINGDOM,all of us poor old obstructions?'
4634,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4635,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"After all, Mrs. Merrifield could not help liking the gentle mother,"
4636,COME TO HER KINGDOM,by force of sympathy; and the Admiral was somewhat fascinated by the
4637,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"freshness and impetuosity of the damsel, as elderly men are wont to"
4638,COME TO HER KINGDOM,be with young girls who amuse them with what they are apt to view as
4639,COME TO HER KINGDOM,an original form of the silliness common to the whole female world
4640,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"except their own wives, and perhaps their daughters; and Bessie was"
4641,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"extremely amused, and held her peace, as she had been used to do in"
4642,COME TO HER KINGDOM,London.  Susan was perhaps the most annoyed and indignant.  She was
4643,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"presiding over seams and button-holes the next afternoon at school,"
4644,COME TO HER KINGDOM,when the mother and daughter walked in; and the whole troop started
4645,COME TO HER KINGDOM,to their feet and curtsied.
4646,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4647,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Don't make them stand!  I hate adulation.  Sit down, please."
4648,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Where's the master?'
4649,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4650,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'In the boys' school, ma'am,' said the mistress, uncomfortably"
4651,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"indicating the presence of Miss Merrifield, who felt herself obliged"
4652,COME TO HER KINGDOM,to come forward and shake hands.
4653,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4654,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Oh! so you have separate schools.  Is not that a needless expense?'
4655,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4656,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'It has always been so,' returned Susan quietly."
4657,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4658,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Board?  No?  Well, no doubt you are right; but I suppose it is at a"
4659,COME TO HER KINGDOM,sacrifice of efficiency.  Have you cookery classes?'
4660,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4661,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'We have not apparatus, and the girls go out too early for it to be"
4662,COME TO HER KINGDOM,of much use.'
4663,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4664,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Ah, that's a mistake.  Drawing?'"
4665,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4666,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'The boys draw.'
4667,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4668,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'I shall go and see them.  Not the girls?  They look orderly enough;
4669,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"but are they intelligent?  Well, I shall look in and examine them on"
4670,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"their special subjects, if they have any.  I suppose not.'"
4671,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4672,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Only class.  Grammar and needlework.'
4673,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4674,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'I see, the old routine.  Quite the village school.'"
4675,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4676,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'It is very nice work,' put in Mrs. Arthuret, who had been looking"
4677,COME TO HER KINGDOM,at it.
4678,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4679,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh yes, it always is when everything is sacrificed to it.  Good-"
4680,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"morning, I shall see more of you, Mrs.--ahem.'"
4681,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4682,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Please, ma'am, should I tell her that she is not a school manager?'"
4683,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"inquired the mistress, somewhat indignantly, when the two ladies had"
4684,COME TO HER KINGDOM,departed.
4685,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4686,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'You had better ask the Vicar what to do,' responded Susan."
4687,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4688,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"The schoolmaster, on his side, seemed to have had so much advice and"
4689,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"offers of assistance in lessons on history, geography, and physical"
4690,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"science, that he had been obliged to refer her to the managers, and"
4691,COME TO HER KINGDOM,explain that till the next inspection he was bound to abide by the
4692,COME TO HER KINGDOM,time-table.
4693,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4694,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Ah, well, I will be one of the managers another year.'"
4695,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4696,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"So she told the Vicar, who smiled, and said, 'We must elect you.'"
4697,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4698,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'I am sure much ought to be done.  It is mere waste to have two
4699,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"separate schools, when a master can bring the children on so much"
4700,COME TO HER KINGDOM,better in the higher subjects.'
4701,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4702,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Mrs. Merrifield and the rest of us are inclined to think that what
4703,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"stands highest of all with us is endangered by mixed schools,' said"
4704,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Mr. Doyle.
4705,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4706,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Oh!' Arthurine opened her eyes; 'but education does all _THAT_!'
4707,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4708,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Education does, but knowledge is not wisdom.  Susan Merrifield's"
4709,COME TO HER KINGDOM,influence has done more for our young women than the best class
4710,COME TO HER KINGDOM,teaching could do.'
4711,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4712,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh, but the Merrifields are all so BORNES and homely; they stand in"
4713,COME TO HER KINGDOM,the way of all culture.'
4714,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4715,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Indeed,' said the Vicar, who had in his pocket a very favourable"
4716,COME TO HER KINGDOM,review of MESA's new historical essay.
4717,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4718,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Surely an old-fashioned squire and Lady Bountiful and their very
4719,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"narrow daughters should not be allowed to prevent improvement,"
4720,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"pauperise the place, and keep it in its old grooves.'"
4721,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4722,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Well, we shall see what you think by the time you have lived here"
4723,COME TO HER KINGDOM,long enough to be eligible for--what?'
4724,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4725,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'School manager, guardian of the poor!' cried Arthurine."
4726,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4727,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'We shall see,' repeated the Vicar.  'Good-morning.'"
4728,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4729,COME TO HER KINGDOM,He asked Bessie's leave to disclose who MESA was.
4730,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4731,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh, don't!' she cried, 'it would spoil the fun!  Besides, mamma"
4732,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"would not like it, which is a better reason.'"
4733,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4734,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"There were plenty of books, old and new, in Bessie's room, magazines"
4735,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"and reviews, but they did not come about the house much, unless any"
4736,COME TO HER KINGDOM,of the Rockstone cousins or the younger generation were staying
4737,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"there, or her brother David had come for a rest of mind and body."
4738,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Between housekeeping, gardening, parish work, and pottering, Mrs."
4739,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Merrifield and Susan never had time for reading, except that Susan"
4740,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"thought it her duty to keep something improving in hand, which"
4741,COME TO HER KINGDOM,generally lasted her six weeks on a moderate average.  The Admiral
4742,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"found quite reading enough in the newspapers, pamphlets, and"
4743,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"business publications; and their neighbours, the Greville family,"
4744,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"were chiefly devoted to hunting and lawn tennis, so that there was"
4745,COME TO HER KINGDOM,some reason in Mrs. Arthuret's lamentation to the Vicar that dear
4746,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Arthurine did so miss intellectual society, such as she had been"
4747,COME TO HER KINGDOM,used to with the High School mistresses--two of whom had actually
4748,COME TO HER KINGDOM,been at Girton!
4749,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4750,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Does she not get on with Bessie Merrifield?' he asked.
4751,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4752,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Miss Bessie has a very sweet face; Arthurine did say she seemed
4753,COME TO HER KINGDOM,well informed and more intelligent than her sister.  Perhaps
4754,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Arthurine might take her up.  It would be such an advantage to the
4755,COME TO HER KINGDOM,poor girl.'
4756,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4757,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Which?' was on Mr. Doyle's tongue, but he restrained it, and only"
4758,COME TO HER KINGDOM,observed that Bessie had lived for a good many years in London.
4759,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4760,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'So I understood,' said Arthurine, 'but with an old grandmother, and"
4761,COME TO HER KINGDOM,that is quite as bad as if it was in the country; but I will see
4762,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"about it.  I might get up a debating society, or one for studying"
4763,COME TO HER KINGDOM,German.'
4764,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4765,COME TO HER KINGDOM,In the meantime Arthurine decided on improving and embellishing the
4766,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"parish with a drinking fountain, and meeting Bessie one afternoon in"
4767,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the village, she started the idea."
4768,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4769,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'But,' said Bessie, 'there is a very good supply.  Papa saw that"
4770,COME TO HER KINGDOM,good water was accessible to all the houses in the village street
4771,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"ten years ago, and the outlying ones have wells, and there's the"
4772,COME TO HER KINGDOM,brook for the cattle.'
4773,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4774,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'I am sure every village should have a fountain and a trough, and I"
4775,COME TO HER KINGDOM,shall have it here instead of this dirty corner.'
4776,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4777,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Can you get the ground?'
4778,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4779,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh, any one would give ground for such a purpose!  Whose is it?'"
4780,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4781,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Mr. Grice's, at Butter End.'"
4782,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4783,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"The next time Susan and Bessie encountered Arthurine, she began--"
4784,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4785,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Can you or Admiral Merrifield do nothing with that horrid old
4786,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Grice!  Never was any one so pigheaded and stupid.'
4787,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4788,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'What?  He won't part with the land you want?'
4789,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4790,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'No; I wrote to him and got no answer.  Then I wrote again, and I"
4791,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"got a peaked-hand sort of note that his wife wrote, I should think."
4792,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"""Mr. Grice presented his compliments"" (compliments indeed!), ""and"
4793,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"had no intention of parting with any part of Spragg's portion."""
4794,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Well, then I called to represent what a benefit it would be to the"
4795,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"parish and his own cattle, and what do you think the old brute"
4796,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"said?--that ""there was a great deal too much done for the parish"
4797,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"already, and he wouldn't have no hand in setting up the labourers,"
4798,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"who were quite impudent enough already.""  Well, I saw it was of no"
4799,COME TO HER KINGDOM,use to talk to an old wretch like that about social movements and
4800,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"equal rights, so I only put the question whether having pure water"
4801,COME TO HER KINGDOM,easily accessible would not tend to make them better behaved and
4802,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"less impudent as he called it, upon which he broke out into a"
4803,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"tirade.  ""He didn't hold with cold water and teetotal, not he.  Why,"
4804,COME TO HER KINGDOM,it had come to _THAT_--that there was no such thing as getting a
4805,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"fair day's work out of a labouring man with their temperance, and"
4806,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"their lectures, and their schools, and their county councils and"
4807,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"what not!""  Really I had read of such people, but I hardly believed"
4808,COME TO HER KINGDOM,they still existed.'
4809,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4810,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Grice is very old, and the regular old sort of farmer,' said"
4811,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Bessie.
4812,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4813,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'But could not the Admiral persuade him, or Mr. Doyle?'"
4814,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4815,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh no,' said Susan, 'it would be of no use.  He was just as bad"
4816,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"about a playground for the boys, though it would have prevented"
4817,COME TO HER KINGDOM,their being troublesome elsewhere.'
4818,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4819,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Besides,' added Bessie, 'I am sure papa would say that there is no"
4820,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"necessity.  He had the water analysed, and it is quite good, and"
4821,COME TO HER KINGDOM,plenty of it.'
4822,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4823,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Well, I shall see what can be done.'"
4824,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4825,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'She thinks us as bad as old Grice,' said Susan, as they saw her"
4826,COME TO HER KINGDOM,walking away in a determined manner.
4827,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4828,COME TO HER KINGDOM,The next thing that was heard was the Admiral coming in from the
4829,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"servants' hall, whither he had been summoned by 'Please, sir, James"
4830,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Hodd wishes to speak to you.'
4831,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4832,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'What is this friend of yours about, Bessie?'"
4833,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4834,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'What friend, papa?'"
4835,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4836,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Why, this Miss Arthur--what d'ye call her?' said the Admiral (who"
4837,COME TO HER KINGDOM,on the whole was much more attracted by her than were his
4838,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"daughters).  'Here's a deputation from her tenant, James Hodd, with"
4839,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"""Please, sir, I wants to know if 'tis allowed to turn folks out of"
4840,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"their houses as they've paid rent for reg'lar with a week's notice,"
4841,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"when they pays by the year.""'"
4842,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4843,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'You don't mean it!' exclaimed Mrs. Merrifield and Susan together.
4844,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4845,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Poor old Mrs. West,' said the mother."
4846,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4847,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'And all the Tibbinses!' exclaimed Susan.  'She can't do it, can"
4848,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"she, papa?'"
4849,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4850,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Certainly not, without the proper notice, and so I told James, and"
4851,COME TO HER KINGDOM,that the notice she had sent down to him was so much waste-paper.'
4852,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4853,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'So at least she has created a village Hampden,' said Bessie,"
4854,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'though, depend upon it, she little supposes herself to be the petty"
4855,COME TO HER KINGDOM,tyrant.'
4856,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4857,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'I must go and explain to her, I suppose, to-morrow morning,' said"
4858,COME TO HER KINGDOM,the Admiral.
4859,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4860,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"However, he had scarcely reached his own gate before the ulstered"
4861,COME TO HER KINGDOM,form was seen rushing up to him.
4862,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4863,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh!  Admiral Merrifield, good-morning; I was coming to ask you--'"
4864,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4865,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'And I was coming to you.'
4866,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4867,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh!  Admiral, is it really so--as that impudent man told me--that"
4868,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"those horrid people can't be got out of those awful tumbledown,"
4869,COME TO HER KINGDOM,unhealthy places for all that immense time?'
4870,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4871,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Surely he was not impudent to you?  He was only asserting his
4872,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"right.  The cottages were taken by the year, and you have no choice"
4873,COME TO HER KINGDOM,but to give six months' notice.  I hope he was not disrespectful.'
4874,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4875,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Well, no--I can't say that he was, though I don't care for those"
4876,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"cap-in-hand ways of your people here.  But at any rate, he says he"
4877,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"won't go--no, not any of them, though I offered to pay them up to"
4878,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the end of the time, and now I must put off my beautiful plans.  I"
4879,COME TO HER KINGDOM,was drawing them all yesterday morning--two model cottages on each
4880,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"side, and the drinking fountain in the middle.  I brought them up to"
4881,COME TO HER KINGDOM,show you.  Could you get the people to move out?  I would promise
4882,COME TO HER KINGDOM,them to return after the rebuilding.'
4883,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4884,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Very nice drawings.  Yes--yes--very kind intentions.'
4885,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4886,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Then can't you persuade them?'
4887,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4888,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'But, my dear young lady, have you thought what is to become of them"
4889,COME TO HER KINGDOM,in the meantime?'
4890,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4891,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Why, live somewhere else!  People in Smokeland were always shifting"
4892,COME TO HER KINGDOM,about.'
4893,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4894,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Yes--those poor little town tenements are generally let on short
4895,COME TO HER KINGDOM,terms and are numerous enough.  But here--where are the vacant
4896,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"cottages for your four families?  Hodd with his five children,"
4897,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Tibbins with eight or nine, Mrs. West and her widow daughter and"
4898,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"three children, and the Porters with a bedridden father?'"
4899,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4900,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'They are dreadfully overcrowded.  Is there really no place?'
4901,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4902,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Probably not nearer than those trumpery new tenements at Bonchamp.
4903,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"That would be eight miles to be tramped to the men's work, and the"
4904,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Wests would lose the washing and charing that maintains them.'
4905,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4906,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Then do you think it can never be done?  See how nice my plans
4907,COME TO HER KINGDOM,are!'
4908,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4909,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh yes! very pretty drawings, but you don't allow much outlet.'"
4910,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4911,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'I thought you had allotments, and that they would do, and I mean to"
4912,COME TO HER KINGDOM,get rid of the pig-sties.'
4913,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4914,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'A most unpopular proceeding, I warn you.'"
4915,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4916,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'There's nothing more unsanitary than a pig-sty.'
4917,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4918,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'That depends on how it is kept.  And may I ask, do you mean also to"
4919,COME TO HER KINGDOM,dispense with staircases?'
4920,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4921,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Oh!  I forgot.  But do you really mean to say that I can never
4922,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"carry out my improvements, and that these people must live all"
4923,COME TO HER KINGDOM,herded together till everybody is dead?'
4924,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4925,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Not quite that,' said the Admiral, laughing; 'but most improvements"
4926,COME TO HER KINGDOM,require patience and a little experience of the temper and habits of
4927,COME TO HER KINGDOM,the people.  There are cottages worse than these.  I think two of
4928,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"them have four rooms, and the Wests and Porters do not require so"
4929,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"much.  If you built one or two elsewhere, and moved the people into"
4930,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"them, or waited for a vacant one, you might carry out some of your"
4931,COME TO HER KINGDOM,plans--gradually.'
4932,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4933,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'And my fountain?'
4934,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4935,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'I am not quite sure, but I am afraid your cottages are on that"
4936,COME TO HER KINGDOM,stratum where you could not bring the water without great expense.'
4937,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4938,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Arthurine controlled herself enough for a civil 'Good-morning!' but
4939,COME TO HER KINGDOM,she shed tears as she walked home and told her pitying mother that
4940,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"she was thwarted on every side, and that nobody could comprehend"
4941,COME TO HER KINGDOM,her.
4942,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4943,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"The meetings for German reading were, however, contrived chiefly--"
4944,COME TO HER KINGDOM,little as Arthurine guessed it--by the influence of Bessie
4945,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Merrifield.  The two Greville girls and Mr. Doyle's sister, together"
4946,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"with the doctor's young wife, two damsels from the next parish, and"
4947,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"a friend or two that the Arthurets had made at Bonchamp, formed an"
4948,COME TO HER KINGDOM,imposing circle--to begin.
4949,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4950,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh, not on WILHELM TELL!' cried Arthurine.  'It might as well be"
4951,COME TO HER KINGDOM,the alphabet at once.'
4952,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4953,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"However, the difficulties in the way of books, and consideration for"
4954,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"general incompetency, reduced her to WILHELM TELL, and she began"
4955,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"with a lecture first on Schiller, and then upon Switzerland, and on"
4956,COME TO HER KINGDOM,the legend; but when Bessie Merrifield put in a word of such history
4957,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"and criticisms as were not in the High School Manual, she was sure"
4958,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"everything else must be wrong--'Fraulein Blumenbach never said so,"
4959,COME TO HER KINGDOM,and she was an admirable German scholar.'
4960,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4961,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Miss Doyle went so far as to declare she should not go again to see
4962,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Bessie Merrifield so silenced, sitting by after the first saying"
4963,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"nothing, but only with a little laugh in her eyes."
4964,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4965,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'But,' said Bessie, 'it is such fun to see any person having it so"
4966,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"entirely her own way--like Macaulay, so cock-sure of everything--and"
4967,COME TO HER KINGDOM,to see those Bonchamp girls--Mytton is their name--so entirely
4968,COME TO HER KINGDOM,adoring her.'
4969,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4970,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'I am sorry she has taken up with those Myttons,' said Miss Doyle."
4971,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4972,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'So am I,' answered Susan."
4973,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4974,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'You too, Susie!' exclaimed Bessie--'you, who never have a word to"
4975,COME TO HER KINGDOM,say against any one!'
4976,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4977,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'I daresay they are very good girls,' said Susan; 'but they are--'"
4978,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4979,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Underbred,' put in Miss Doyle in the pause.  'And how they"
4980,COME TO HER KINGDOM,flatter!'
4981,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4982,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'I think the raptures are genuine gush,' said Bessie; 'but that is"
4983,COME TO HER KINGDOM,so much the worse for Arthurine.  Is there any positive harm in the
4984,COME TO HER KINGDOM,family beyond the second-rate tone?'
4985,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4986,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'It was while you were away,' said Susan; 'but their father somehow"
4987,COME TO HER KINGDOM,behaved very ill about old Colonel Mytton's will--at least papa
4988,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"thought so, and never wished us to visit them.'"
4989,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4990,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'He was thought to have used unfair influence on the old gentleman,'"
4991,COME TO HER KINGDOM,said Miss Doyle; 'but the daughters are so young that probably they
4992,COME TO HER KINGDOM,had no part in it.  Only it gives a general distrust of the family;
4993,COME TO HER KINGDOM,and the sons are certainly very undesirable young men.'
4994,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4995,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'It is unlucky,' said Bessie, 'that we can do nothing but inflict a"
4996,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"course of snubbing, in contrast with a course of admiration.'"
4997,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
4998,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'I am sure I don't want to snub her,' said good-natured Susan."
4999,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Only when she does want to do such queer things, how can it be"
5000,COME TO HER KINGDOM,helped?'
5001,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5002,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"It was quite true, Mrs. and Miss Arthuret had been duly called upon"
5003,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"and invited about by the neighbourhood; but it was a scanty one, and"
5004,COME TO HER KINGDOM,they had not wealth and position enough to compensate for the girl's
5005,COME TO HER KINGDOM,self-assertion and literary pretensions.  It was not a superior or
5006,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"intellectual society, and, as the Rockstone Merrifields laughingly"
5007,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"declared, it was fifty years behindhand, and where Bessie"
5008,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Merrifield, for the sake of the old stock and her meek bearing of"
5009,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"her success--nay, her total ignoring of her literary honours--would"
5010,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"be accepted.  Arthurine, half her age, and a newcomer, was disliked"
5011,COME TO HER KINGDOM,for the pretensions which her mother innocently pressed on the
5012,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"world.  Simplicity and complacency were taken for arrogance, and the"
5013,COME TO HER KINGDOM,mother and daughter were kept upon formal terms of civility by all
5014,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"but the Merrifields, who were driven into discussion and opposition"
5015,COME TO HER KINGDOM,by the young lady's attempts at reformations in the parish.
5016,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5017,COME TO HER KINGDOM,It was the less wonder that they made friends where their intimacy
5018,COME TO HER KINGDOM,was sought and appreciated.  There was nothing underbred about
5019,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"themselves; both were ladies ingrain, though Arthurine was abrupt"
5020,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"and sometimes obtrusive, but they had not lived a life such as to"
5021,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"render them sensitive to the lack of fine edges in others, and were"
5022,COME TO HER KINGDOM,quite ready to be courted by those who gave the meed of appreciation
5023,COME TO HER KINGDOM,that both regarded as Arthurine's just portion.
5024,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5025,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Mr. Mytton had been in India, and had come back to look after an old"
5026,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"relation; to whom he and his wife had paid assiduous attention, and"
5027,COME TO HER KINGDOM,had been so rewarded as to excite the suspicion and displeasure of
5028,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the rest of the family.  The prize had not been a great one, and the"
5029,COME TO HER KINGDOM,prosperity of the family was further diminished by the continual
5030,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"failures of the ne'er-do-well sons, so that they had to make the"
5031,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"best of the dull, respectable old house they had inherited, in the"
5032,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"dull, respectable old street of the dull, respectable old town."
5033,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Daisy and Pansy Mytton were, however, bright girls, and to them"
5034,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Arthurine Arthuret was a sort of realised dream of romance, raised"
5035,COME TO HER KINGDOM,suddenly to the pinnacle of all to which they had ever durst aspire.
5036,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5037,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"After meeting her at a great OMNIUM GATHERUM garden party, the"
5038,COME TO HER KINGDOM,acquaintance flourished.  Arthurine was delighted to give the
5039,COME TO HER KINGDOM,intense pleasure that the freedom of a country visit afforded to the
5040,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"sisters, and found in them the contemporaries her girl nature had"
5041,COME TO HER KINGDOM,missed.
5042,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5043,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"They were not stupid, though they had been poorly educated, and were"
5044,COME TO HER KINGDOM,quite willing to be instructed by her and to read all she told them.
5045,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"In fact, she was their idol, and a very gracious one.  Deeply did"
5046,COME TO HER KINGDOM,they sympathise in all her sufferings from the impediments cast in
5047,COME TO HER KINGDOM,her way at Stokesley.
5048,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5049,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Indeed, the ladies there did not meet her so often on their own"
5050,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"ground for some time, and were principally disturbed by reports of"
5051,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"her doings at Bonchamp, where she played at cricket, and at hockey,"
5052,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"gave a course of lectures on physiology, presided at a fancy-dress"
5053,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"bazaar for the schools as Lady Jane Grey, and was on two or three"
5054,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"committees.  She travelled by preference on her tricycle, though she"
5055,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"had a carriage, chiefly for the sake of her mother, who was still in"
5056,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"a state of fervent admiration, even though perhaps a little worried"
5057,COME TO HER KINGDOM,at times by being hurried past her sober paces.
5058,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5059,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"The next shock that descended on Stokesley was that, in great"
5060,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"indignation, a cousin sent the Merrifields one of those American"
5061,COME TO HER KINGDOM,magazines which are read and contributed to by a large proportion of
5062,COME TO HER KINGDOM,English.  It contained an article called 'The Bide-as-we-bes and
5063,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"parish of Stick-stodge-cum-Cadgerley,' and written with the same"
5064,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"sort of clever, flippant irony as the description of the mixed"
5065,COME TO HER KINGDOM,company in the boarding-house on the Lago Maggiore.
5066,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5067,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"There was the parish embowered, or rather choked, in trees, the"
5068,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"orderly mechanical routine, the perfect self-satisfaction of all"
5069,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"parties, and their imperviousness to progress,--the two squires, one"
5070,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"a fox-hunter, the other a general reposing on his laurels,--the"
5071,COME TO HER KINGDOM,school where everything was subordinated to learning to behave
5072,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"oneself lowly and reverently to all one's betters, and to do one's"
5073,COME TO HER KINGDOM,duty in that state of life to which it _HAS_ pleased Heaven to call
5074,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"one,--the horror at her tricycle, the impossibility of improvement,"
5075,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the predilection for farmyard odours, the adherence to tumbledown"
5076,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"dwellings, the contempt of drinking fountains,--all had their meed"
5077,COME TO HER KINGDOM,of exaggeration not without drollery.
5078,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5079,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"The two ancient spinsters, daughters to the general, with their"
5080,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"pudding-baskets, buttonholes, and catechisms, had their full share--"
5081,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"dragooning the parish into discipline,--the younger having so far"
5082,COME TO HER KINGDOM,marched with the century as to have indited a few little tracts of
5083,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the Goody Two-Shoes order, and therefore being mentioned by her"
5084,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"friends with bated breath as something formidable, 'who writes,'"
5085,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"although, when brought to the test, her cultivation was of the"
5086,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"vaguest, most discursive order.  Finally, there was a sketch of the"
5087,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"heavy dinner party which had welcomed the strangers, and of the"
5088,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"ponderous county magnates and their wives who had been invited, and"
5089,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the awe that their broad and expansive ladies expected to impress,"
5090,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"and how one set talked of their babies, and the other of G.F.S."
5091,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"girls, and the gentlemen seemed to be chiefly occupied in abusing"
5092,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"their M.P. and his politics.  Altogether, it was given as a lesson"
5093,COME TO HER KINGDOM,to Americans of the still feudal and stationary state of country
5094,COME TO HER KINGDOM,districts in poor old England.
5095,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5096,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'What do you think of this, Bessie?' exclaimed Admiral Merrifield."
5097,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'We seem to have got a young firebrand in the midst of us.'
5098,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5099,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh, papa! have you got that thing?  What a pity!'"
5100,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5101,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'You don't mean that you have seen it before?'
5102,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5103,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Yes; one of my acquaintances in London sent it to me.'
5104,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5105,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'And you kept it to yourself?'
5106,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5107,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'I thought it would only vex you and mamma.  Who sent it to you?'
5108,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5109,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Anne did, with all the passages marked.  What a horrid little"
5110,COME TO HER KINGDOM,treacherous baggage!'
5111,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5112,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'I daresay we are very tempting.  For once we see ourselves as
5113,COME TO HER KINGDOM,others see us!  And you see 'tis American.'
5114,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5115,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'All the worse, holding us, who have done our best to welcome her"
5116,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"hospitably, up to the derision of the Yankees!'"
5117,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5118,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'But you won't take any notice.'
5119,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5120,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Certainly not, ridiculous little puss, except to steer as clear of"
5121,COME TO HER KINGDOM,her as possible for fear she should be taking her observations.
5122,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"""Bide as we be""; why, 'tis the best we can do.  She can't pick a"
5123,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"hole in your mother though, Bess.  It would have been hard to have"
5124,COME TO HER KINGDOM,forgiven her that!  You're not such an aged spinster.'
5125,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5126,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'It is very funny, though,' said Bessie; 'just enough exaggeration"
5127,COME TO HER KINGDOM,to give it point!  Here is her interview with James Hodd.'
5128,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5129,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Whereat the Admiral could not help laughing heartily, and then he"
5130,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"picked himself out as the general, laughed again, and said:"
5131,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Naughty girl!  Bess, I'm glad that is not your line.  Little"
5132,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"tracts--Goody Two-Shoes!  Why, what did that paper say of your"
5133,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"essay, Miss Bess?  That it might stand a comparison with Helps,"
5134,COME TO HER KINGDOM,wasn't it?'
5135,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5136,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'And I wish I was likely to enjoy such lasting fame as Goody Two-
5137,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Shoes,' laughed Bessie, in a state of secret exultation at this bit"
5138,COME TO HER KINGDOM,of testimony from her father.
5139,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5140,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Mrs. Merrifield, though unscathed, was much more hurt and annoyed"
5141,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"than either her husband or her daughter, especially at Susan and"
5142,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Bessie being termed old maids.  She _DID_ think it very ungrateful,"
5143,COME TO HER KINGDOM,and wondered how Mrs. Arthuret could have suffered such a thing to
5144,COME TO HER KINGDOM,be done.  Only the poor woman was quite foolish about her daughter--
5145,COME TO HER KINGDOM,could have had no more authority than a cat.  'So much for modern
5146,COME TO HER KINGDOM,education.'
5147,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5148,COME TO HER KINGDOM,But it was not pleasant to see the numbers of the magazine on the
5149,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"counters at Bonchamp, and to know there were extracts in the local"
5150,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"papers, and still less to be indignantly condoled with by neighbours"
5151,COME TO HER KINGDOM,who expressed their intention of 'cutting' the impertinent girl.
5152,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"They were exactly the 'old fogies' Arthurine cared for the least,"
5153,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"yet whose acquaintance was the most creditable, and the home party"
5154,COME TO HER KINGDOM,at Stokesley were unanimous in entreating others to ignore the whole
5155,COME TO HER KINGDOM,and treat the newcomers as if nothing had happened.
5156,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5157,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"They themselves shook hands, and exchanged casual remarks as if"
5158,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"nothing were amiss, nor was the subject mentioned, except that Mrs."
5159,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Arthuret contrived to get a private interview with Mrs. Merrifield.
5160,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5161,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh! dear Mrs. Merrifield, I am so grieved, and so is Arthurine.  We"
5162,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"were told that the Admiral was so excessively angry, and he is so"
5163,COME TO HER KINGDOM,kind.  I could not bear for him to think Arthurine meant anything
5164,COME TO HER KINGDOM,personal.'
5165,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5166,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Indeed,' said Mrs. Merrifield, rather astonished."
5167,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5168,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'But is he so very angry?--for it is all a mistake.'
5169,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5170,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'He laughs, and so does Bessie,' said the mother."
5171,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5172,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Laughs!  Does he?  But I do assure you Arthurine never meant any
5173,COME TO HER KINGDOM,place in particular; she only intended to describe the way things go
5174,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"on in country districts, don't you understand?  She was talking one"
5175,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"day at the Myttons, and they were all so much amused that they"
5176,COME TO HER KINGDOM,wanted her to write it down.  She read it one evening when they were
5177,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"with us, and they declared it was too good not to be published--and"
5178,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"almost before she knew it, Fred Mytton's literary friend got hold of"
5179,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"it and took it to the agency of this paper.  But indeed, indeed, she"
5180,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"never thought of its being considered personal, and is as vexed as"
5181,COME TO HER KINGDOM,possible at the way in which it has been taken up.  She has every
5182,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"feeling about your kindness to us, and she was so shocked when Pansy"
5183,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Mytton told us that the Admiral was furious.'
5184,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5185,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Whoever told Miss Mytton so made a great mistake.  The Admiral only
5186,COME TO HER KINGDOM,is--is--amused--as you know gentlemen will be at young girls'
5187,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"little--little scrapes,' returned Mrs. Merrifield, longing to say"
5188,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'impertinences,' but refraining, and scarcely believing what"
5189,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"nevertheless was true, that Arthurine did not know how personal she"
5190,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"had been, although her mother said it all over again twice.  Bessie,"
5191,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"however, did believe it, from experience of resemblances where she"
5192,COME TO HER KINGDOM,had never intended direct portraiture; and when there was a somewhat
5193,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"earnest invitation to a garden party at the Gap, the Merrifields not"
5194,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"only accepted for themselves, but persuaded as many of their"
5195,COME TO HER KINGDOM,neighbours as they could to countenance the poor girl.  'There is
5196,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"something solid at the bottom in spite of all the effervescence,'"
5197,COME TO HER KINGDOM,said Bessie.
5198,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5199,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"It was late in the year for a garden party, being on the 2d of"
5200,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"October, but weather and other matters had caused delays, and the"
5201,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Indian summer had begun with warm sun and exquisite tints.  'What
5202,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"would not the maple and the liquid amber have been by this time,'"
5203,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"thought the sisters, 'if they had been spared.'  Some of the PETITE"
5204,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"NOBLESSE, however, repented of their condescension when they saw how"
5205,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"little it was appreciated.  Mrs. Arthuret, indeed, was making"
5206,COME TO HER KINGDOM,herself the best hostess that a lady who had served no
5207,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"apprenticeship could be to all alike, but Arthurine or 'Atty,' as"
5208,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Daisy and Pansy were heard shouting to her--all in white flannels, a"
5209,COME TO HER KINGDOM,man all but the petticoats--seemed to be absorbed in a little court
5210,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"of the second-rate people of Bonchamp, some whom, as Mrs. Greville"
5211,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"and Lady Smithson agreed, they had never expected to meet.  She was"
5212,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"laughing and talking eagerly, and by and by ran up to Bessie,"
5213,COME TO HER KINGDOM,exclaiming in a patronising tone--
5214,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5215,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Oh! my dear Miss Bessie, let me introduce you to Mr. Foxholm--such"
5216,COME TO HER KINGDOM,a clever literary man.  He knows everybody--all about everybody and
5217,COME TO HER KINGDOM,everything.  It would be such an advantage!  And he has actually
5218,COME TO HER KINGDOM,made me give him my autograph!  Only think of that!'
5219,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5220,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Bessie thought of her own good luck in being anonymous, but did not"
5221,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"express it, only saying, 'Autograph-hunters are a great nuisance.  I"
5222,COME TO HER KINGDOM,know several people who find them so.'
5223,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5224,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Yes, he said it was one of the penalties of fame that one must"
5225,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"submit to,' returned Miss Arthuret, with a delighted laugh of"
5226,COME TO HER KINGDOM,consciousness.
5227,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5228,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Bessie rejoiced that none of her own people were near to see the
5229,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"patronising manner in which Arthurine introduced her to Mr. Foxholm,"
5230,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"a heavily-bearded man, whose eyes she did not at all like, and who"
5231,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"began by telling her that he felt as if he had crossed the Rubicon,"
5232,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"and entering an Arcadia, had found a Parnassus."
5233,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5234,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Bessie looked to see whether the highly-educated young lady detected
5235,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the malaprop for the Helicon, but Arthurine was either too well-bred"
5236,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"or too much exalted to notice either small slips, or even bad taste,"
5237,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"and she stood smiling and blushing complacently.  However, just then"
5238,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Susan hurried up.  'Bessie, you are wanted.  Here's a card.  The"
5239,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"gentleman sent it in, and papa asked me to find you.'"
5240,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5241,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Bessie opened her eyes.  The card belonged to the editor of one of
5242,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the most noted magazines of the day, but one whose principles she"
5243,COME TO HER KINGDOM,did not entirely approve.  What could be coming?
5244,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5245,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Her father was waiting for her.
5246,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5247,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Well, Miss Bessie,' he said, laughing, 'Jane said the gentleman was"
5248,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"very urgent in wanting to know when you would be in.  An offer, eh?'"
5249,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5250,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Perhaps it is an offer, but not of _THAT_ sort,' said Bessie, and"
5251,COME TO HER KINGDOM,she explained what the unliterary Admiral had not understood.  He
5252,COME TO HER KINGDOM,answered with a whistle.
5253,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5254,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Shall you do it, Bessie?'"
5255,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5256,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'I think not,' she said quietly."
5257,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5258,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"The editor was found waiting for her, with many apologies for"
5259,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"bringing her home, and the Admiral was so delighted with his"
5260,COME TO HER KINGDOM,agreeableness as hardly to be able to tear himself away to bring
5261,COME TO HER KINGDOM,home his wife.
5262,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5263,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"The offer was, as Bessie expected, of excellent terms for a serial"
5264,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"story--terms that proved to her what was her own value, and in which"
5265,COME TO HER KINGDOM,she saw education for her sister Anne's eldest boy.
5266,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5267,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Of course, there would be a certain adaptation to our readers.'"
5268,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5269,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"She knew what that meant, and there was that in her face which drew"
5270,COME TO HER KINGDOM,forth the assurance.
5271,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5272,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Of course nothing you would not wish to say would be required, but"
5273,COME TO HER KINGDOM,it would be better not to press certain subjects.'
5274,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5275,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'I understand,' said Bessie.  'I doubt--'"
5276,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5277,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Perhaps you will think it over.'
5278,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5279,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Bessie's first thought was, 'If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, then let"
5280,COME TO HER KINGDOM,my right hand forget her cunning.'  That had been the inward motto
5281,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"of her life.  Her second was, 'Little Sam!  David's mission room!'"
5282,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"There was no necessity to answer at once, and she knew the"
5283,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"periodical rather by report than by reading, so she accepted the two"
5284,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"numbers that were left with her, and promised to reply in a week."
5285,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"It was a question on which to take counsel with her father, and with"
5286,COME TO HER KINGDOM,her own higher conscience and heavenly Guide.
5287,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5288,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"The Admiral, though not much given to reading for its own sake, and"
5289,COME TO HER KINGDOM,perhaps inclined to think ephemeral literature the more trifling
5290,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"because his little daughter was a great light there, was anything"
5291,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"but a dull man, and had an excellent judgment.  So Bessie, with all"
5292,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the comfort of a woman still with a wise father's head over her,"
5293,COME TO HER KINGDOM,decided to commit the matter to him.  He was somewhat disappointed
5294,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"at finding her agreeable guest gone, and wished that dinner and bed"
5295,COME TO HER KINGDOM,had been offered.
5296,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5297,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Mrs. Merrifield and Susan were still a good deal excited about
5298,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Arthurine's complimentary friend, who they said seemed to belong to"
5299,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Fred Mytton, of whom some of the ladies had been telling most"
5300,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"unpleasant reports, and there was much lamentation over the set into"
5301,COME TO HER KINGDOM,which their young neighbour had thrown herself.
5302,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5303,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'Such a dress too!' sighed Mrs. Merrifield.
5304,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5305,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'And her headmistress has just arrived,' said Susan, 'to make her"
5306,COME TO HER KINGDOM,worse than ever!'
5307,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5308,COME TO HER KINGDOM,'How comes a headmistress to be running about the country at this
5309,COME TO HER KINGDOM,time of year?' asked Bessie.
5310,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5311,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'She has been very ill,' said Mrs. Merrifield, 'and they wrote to"
5312,COME TO HER KINGDOM,her to come down as soon as she could move.  There was a telegram
5313,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"this morning, and she drove up in the midst of the party, and was"
5314,COME TO HER KINGDOM,taken to her room at once to rest.  That was the reason Miss
5315,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Arthuret was away so long.  I thought it nice in her.'
5316,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5317,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Perhaps she will do good,' said Bessie."
5318,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5319,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Dinner was just over, and the Admiral had settled down with his"
5320,COME TO HER KINGDOM,shaded lamp to read and judge of the article that Bessie had given
5321,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"him as a specimen, when in came the message, 'Mrs. Rudden wishes to"
5322,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"speak to you, sir.'"
5323,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5324,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Mrs. Rudden was the prosperous widow who continued the business in
5325,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the village shop, conjointly with the little farm belonging to the"
5326,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Gap property.  She was a shrewd woman, had been able to do very well"
5327,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"by her family, and was much esteemed, paying a rent which was a"
5328,COME TO HER KINGDOM,considerable item in the Gap means.  The ladies wondered together at
5329,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"the summons.  Susan hoped 'that girl' did not want to evict her, and"
5330,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Bessie suggested that a co-operative store was a more probable
5331,COME TO HER KINGDOM,peril.  Presently the Admiral came back.  'Do any of you know Miss
5332,COME TO HER KINGDOM,Arthuret's writing?' he said.
5333,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5334,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'Bessie knows it best,' said Susan."
5335,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5336,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"He showed a letter. 'That is hers--the signature,' said Bessie. 'I"
5337,COME TO HER KINGDOM,are not sure about the rest.  Why--what does it mean?'
5338,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5339,COME TO HER KINGDOM,For she read--
5340,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5341,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5342,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'The Gap, 2D OCT."
5343,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5344,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"'MRS. RUDDEN,--You are requested to pay over to the bearer, Mr."
5345,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"Foxholm, fifty pounds of the rent you were about to bring me to-"
5346,COME TO HER KINGDOM,"morrow.--I remain, etc.,"
5347,COME TO HER KINGDOM,
5348,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.','ARTHURINE ARTHURET.'
5349,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5350,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5351,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.','What does it mean?' asked Bessie again.  'That's just what Mrs.
5352,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"Rudden has come up to me to ask,' said the Admiral.  'This fellow"
5353,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',presented it in her shop about a quarter of an hour ago.  The good
5354,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',woman smelt a rat.  What do you think she did?  She looked at it and
5355,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"him, asked him to wait a bit, whipped out at her back door, luckily"
5356,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"met the policeman starting on his rounds, bade him have an eye to"
5357,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"the customer in her shop, and came off to show it to me.  That young"
5358,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"woman is demented enough for anything, and is quite capable of doing"
5359,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"it--for some absurd scheme.  But do you think it is hers, or a"
5360,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',swindle?'
5361,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5362,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.','Didn't she say she had given her autograph?' exclaimed Susan.
5363,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5364,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"'And see here,' said Bessie, 'her signature is at the top of the"
5365,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',sheet of note-paper--small paper.  And as she always writes very
5366,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"large, it would be easy to fill up the rest, changing the first side"
5367,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',over.'
5368,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5369,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"'I must take it up to her at once,' said the Admiral.  'Even if it"
5370,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"be genuine, she may just as well see that it is a queer thing to"
5371,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"have done, and not exactly the way to treat her tenants.'"
5372,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5373,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.','It is strange too that this man should have known anything about
5374,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"Mrs. Rudden,' said Mrs. Merrifield."
5375,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5376,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"'Mrs. Rudden says she had a message this morning, when she had come"
5377,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"up with her rent and accounts, to say that Miss Arthuret was very"
5378,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"much engaged, and would be glad if she would come to-morrow!  Could"
5379,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',this fellow have been about then?'
5380,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5381,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"No one knew, but Bessie breathed the word, 'Was not that young"
5382,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',Mytton there?'
5383,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5384,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"It was not taken up, for no one liked to pronounce the obvious"
5385,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"inference.  Besides, the Admiral was in haste, not thinking it well"
5386,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',that Mr. Foxholm should be longer kept under surveillance in the
5387,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"shop, among the bread, bacon, cheeses, shoes, and tins of potted"
5388,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',meat.
5389,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5390,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',He was then called for; and on his loudly exclaiming that he had
5391,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"been very strangely treated, the Admiral quietly told him that Mrs."
5392,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"Rudden had been disturbed at so unusual a way of demanding her rent,"
5393,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',and had come for advice on the subject; and to satisfy their minds
5394,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"that all was right, Mr. Foxholm would, no doubt, consent to wait"
5395,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',till the young lady could be referred to.  Mr. Foxholm did very
5396,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',decidedly object; he said no one had any right to detain him when
5397,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"the lady's signature was plain, and Admiral Merrifield had seen him"
5398,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"in her society, and he began an account of the philanthropical"
5399,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"purpose for which he said the money had been intended, but he was"
5400,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',cut short.
5401,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5402,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"'You must be aware,' said the Admiral, 'that this is not an ordinary"

5404,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',ascertain your authority more fully before paying over so large a
5405,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"sum.  I give you your choice, therefore, either of accompanying us"
5406,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"to the Gap, or of remaining in Mrs. Rudden's parlour till we"
5407,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',return.'
5408,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5409,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"The furtive eye glanced about, and the parlour was chosen.  Did he"

5411,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5412,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"The dinner at the Gap was over, and Miss Elmore, the headmistress,"
5413,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"was established in an arm-chair, listening to the outpouring of her"
5414,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',former pupil and the happy mother about all the felicities and
5415,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"glories of their present life, the only drawback being the dullness"
5416,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',and obstructiveness of the immediate neighbours.  'I thought Miss

5419,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"'Oh no--quite impossible!  These are Merrifields, but the daughters"

5430,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.','Oh! perhaps the editor is coming here!' cried Arthurine.  'Did you

5523,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"'1 will do my best,' said the Admiral.  'I will try and get a"
5524,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"confession out of him, and send him off, though it is a pity that"

5530,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"It was so late that the Admiral did not come back that night, and"

5532,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"on finding there was no escape, confessed the fraud, but threw most"
5533,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"of the blame on Fred Mytton, who was in debt, not only to him but to"
5534,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"others.  Foxholm himself seemed to have been an adventurer, who"
5535,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"preyed on young men at the billiard-table, and had there been in"
5536,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"some collusion with Fred, though the Admiral had little doubt as to"
5537,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',which was the greater villain.  He had been introduced to the Mytton
5538,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"family, who were not particular; indeed, Mr. Mytton had no objection"
5539,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"to increasing his pocket-money by a little wary, profitable betting"
5540,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"and gambling on his own account.  However, the associates had no"
5541,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"doubt brought Bonchamp to the point of being too hot to hold them,"
5542,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"and Fred, overhearing the arrangement with Mrs. Rudden, had"
5543,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',communicated it to him--whence the autograph trick.  Foxholm was
5544,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"gone, and in the course of the day it was known that young Mytton"
5545,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',was also gone.
5546,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5547,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',The Admiral promised that none of his family should mention the
5548,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"matter, and that he would do his best to silence Mrs. Rudden, who"
5549,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',for that matter probably believed the whole letter to have been
5550,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"forged, and would not enter into the enthusiasm of autographs."
5551,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5552,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"'Oh, thank you!  It is so kind,' said the mother; and Arthurine, who"

5559,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',
5560,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"'Is that the cruellest cut of all?' thought Miss Elmore, as she"
5561,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',beheld her former pupil scarcely restraining herself enough for the
5562,'ARTHURINE ARTHURET.',"farewell civilities, and then breaking down into a flood of tears."

5622,_ME_.',
5623,_ME_.','Oh! Arthurine.  How often have I told you that examinations are not

5638,_ME_.',
5639,_ME_.',It would be wearisome to relate all that Arthurine finally told of
5640,_ME_.',those thwartings by the Merrifields which had thrown her into the
5641,_ME_.',"arms of the Mytton family, nor how Miss Elmore brought her to"
5642,_ME_.',"confess that each scheme was either impracticable, or might have"
5643,_ME_.',"been injurious, and that a little grain of humility might have made"
5644,_ME_.',her see things very differently.  Yet it must be owned that the good
5645,_ME_.',lady felt rather like bending a bow that would spring back again.
5646,_ME_.',
5647,_ME_.',"Bessie Merrifield had, like her family, been inclined to conclude"
5648,_ME_.',that all was the fault of High Schools.  She did not see Miss Elmore
5649,_ME_.',"at first, thinking the Arthurets not likely to wish to be intruded"
5650,_ME_.',"upon, and having besides a good deal to think over.  For she and her"
5651,_ME_.',"father had talked over the proposal, which pecuniarily was so"
5652,_ME_.',"tempting, and he, without prejudice, but on principle, had concurred"
5653,_ME_.',with her in deciding that it was her duty not to add one touch of
5654,_ME_.',attractiveness to aught which supported a cause contrary to their
5655,_ME_.',strongest convictions.  Her father's approbation was the crowning
5656,_ME_.',"pleasure, though she felt the external testimony to her abilities,"
5657,_ME_.',quite enough to sympathise with such intoxication of success as to
5658,_ME_.',make any compliment seem possible.  Miss Elmore had one long talk

5660,_ME_.',
5661,_ME_.',"'I wish to consult you about my poor, foolish child.'"
5662,_ME_.',
5663,_ME_.','Ah!  I am afraid we have not helped her enough!' said Bessie.  'If
5664,_ME_.',we had been more sympathetic she might have trusted us more.'
5665,_ME_.',
5666,_ME_.','Then you are good enough to believe that it was not all folly and
5667,_ME_.',presumption.'
5668,_ME_.',
5669,_ME_.',"'I am sure it was not,' said Bessie.  'None of us ever thought it"
5670,_ME_.',"more than inexperience and a little exaltation, with immense good"
5671,_ME_.',"intention at the bottom.  Of course, our dear old habits did look"
5672,_ME_.',"dull, coming from life and activity, and we rather resented her"
5673,_ME_.',"contempt for them; but I am quite sure that after a little while,"
5674,_ME_.',"every one will forget all about this, or only recollect it as one"
5675,_ME_.',does a girlish scrape.'
5676,_ME_.',
5677,_ME_.','Yes.  To suppose all the neighbourhood occupied in laughing at her
5678,_ME_.',"is only another phase of self-importance.  You see, the poor child"

5680,_ME_.',"whatever I could do, to seem everything, and she only knew things"
5681,_ME_.',"beyond by books.  She had success enough there to turn her head, and"
5682,_ME_.',"not going to Cambridge, never had fair measure of her abilities."
5683,_ME_.',Then came prosperity--'
5684,_ME_.',
5685,_ME_.',"'Quite enough to upset any one's balance,' said Bessie.  'In fact,"

5687,_ME_.',
5688,_ME_.','Poor things!  They were so happy--so open-hearted.  I did long to

5690,_ME_.',
5691,_ME_.',"'It will all come right now,' said Bessie.  'Mrs Arthuret spoke of"

5840,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),
5841,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),"C.  So far as _YOU_ know.  Oh no, he is not naturally dense.  He is"
5842,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),"a dear old man; but you know clerics of his date, especially when"
5843,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),"they have vegetated in the country, never know anything but the"

5848,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),as none of the masters at old Coade's ever did.  What has made you
5849,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),take such a mortal aversion to the place?  We used to think it next

5860,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),
5861,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),C.  I shall tell mother that if she must needs come down to wallow
5862,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),"in her native goodiness, it is due to let me board in Kensington"

5867,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),
5868,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),"C.  Now, Lucius, you speak out of the remains of the old tyrannical"

5873,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),"C.  No doubt the men liked it!  But won't you stand by me, Lucius?"
5874,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),You say it would be for the general peace.
5875,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),
5876,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),L.  I only said you would be better away than making yourself
5877,L.  (A SLIGHT LAUGH.),"obnoxious.  I can't think how you can have the heart, Cis, such a"

5892,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,E.  There!  Mary has got the house at Brompton off her hands and can

5894,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,She wants to bring her piano; it has a better tone than ours.

5896,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,MR. A.  Certainly!  Little Miss Hilda there will soon be strumming

5898,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,the evening with hers.
5899,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5900,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,E.  Oh!
5901,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5902,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"MR. A.  Why, Phrasie, what's the matter?"
5903,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5904,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"E.  This is a blow!  Cicely is only coming to be bridesmaid, and"
5905,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,then going back to board at Kensington and go on with her studies.
5906,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5907,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,MR. A.  To board?  All alone?
5908,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5909,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,E.  Oh! that's the way with young ladies!
5910,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5911,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,MR. A.  Mary cannot have consented.
5912,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5913,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"E.  Have you done, little folks?  Then say grace, Hilda, and run out"
5914,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"till the lesson bell rings.  Yes, poor Mary, I am afraid she thinks"
5915,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,all that Cecilia decrees is right; or if she does not naturally
5916,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"believe so, she is made to."
5917,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5918,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"MR. A.  Come, come, Phrasie, I always thought Mary a model mother."
5919,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5920,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"E.  So did I, and so she was while the children were small, except"
5921,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,that they were more free and easy with her than was the way in our
5922,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,time.  And I think she is all that is to be desired to her son; but
5923,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"when last I was in London, I cannot say I was satisfied, I thought"
5924,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,Cissy had got beyond her.
5925,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5926,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,MR. A.  For want of a father?
5927,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5928,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,E.  Not entirely.  You know I could not think Charles Moldwarp quite
5929,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"worthy of Mary, though she never saw it."
5930,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5931,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,MR. A.  Latterly we saw so little of him!  He liked to spend his
5932,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"holiday in mountain climbing, and Mary made her visits here alone."
5933,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5934,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"E.  Exactly so.  Sympathy faded out between them, though she, poor"
5935,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"dear, never betrayed it, if she realised it, which I doubt.  And as"
5936,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"Cissy took after her father, this may have weakened her allegiance"
5937,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"to her mother.  At any rate, as soon as she was thought to have"
5938,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"outgrown her mother's teaching, those greater things, mother's"
5939,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"influence and culture, were not thought of, and she went to school"
5940,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"and had her companions and interests apart; while Mary, good soul,"
5941,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"filled up the vacancy with good works, and if once you get into the"
5942,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"swing of that sort of thing in town, there's no end to the demands"
5943,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,upon your time.  I don't think she ever let them bore her husband.
5944,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"He was out all day, and didn't want her; but I am afraid they do"
5945,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"bore her daughter, and absorb attention and time, so as to hinder"
5946,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"full companionship, till Cissy has grown up an extraneous creature,"
5947,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"not formed by her.  Mary thinks, in her humility, dear old thing,"
5948,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,that it is a much superior creature; but I don't like it as well as
5949,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,the old sort.
5950,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5951,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,MR. A.  The old barndoor hen hatched her eggs and bred up her chicks
5952,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,better than the fine prize fowl.  Eh?
5953,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5954,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"E.  So that incubator-hatched chicks, with a hot-bed instead of a"
5955,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"hovering wing and tender cluck-cluck, are the fashion!  I was in"
5956,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"hopes that coming down to the old coop, with no professors to run"
5957,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"after, and you to lead them both, all would right itself, but it"
5958,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,seems my young lady wants more improving.
5959,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5960,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"MR. A.  Well, my dear, it must be mortifying to a clever girl to"
5961,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,have her studies cut short.
5962,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5963,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,E.  Certainly; but in my time we held that studies were subordinate
5964,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,to duties; and that there were other kinds of improvement than in
5965,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,model-drawing and all the rest of it.
5966,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5967,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"MR. A.  It will not be for long, and Cissy will find the people, or"
5968,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"has found them, and Mary will accept them."
5969,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5970,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"E.  If her native instinct objects, she will be cajoled or bullied"
5971,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,into seeing with Cissy's eyes.
5972,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,
5973,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"MR. A.  Well, Euphrasia, my dear, let us trust that people are the"
5974,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"best judges of their own affairs, and remember that the world has"
5975,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,"got beyond us.  Mary was always a sensible, right-minded girl, and I"
5976,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,cannot believe her as blind as you would make out.
5977,CHILDREN EATING BREAD AND MILK.,

6078,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,C.  So I settled the matter at once.

6080,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"B.  Quite right, too, Cis."
6081,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6082,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,C.  The dear woman was torn every way.  Grandpapa and Aunt Phrasie
6083,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"wanted her to pin me down into the native stodge; and Lucius, like a"
6084,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"true man, went in for subjection:  so there was nothing for it but"
6085,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,to put my foot down.  And though little mother might moan a little
6086,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"to me, I knew she would stand up stoutly for me to all the rest, and"
6087,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,vindicate my liberty.
6088,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6089,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,B.  To keep you down there.  Such a place is very well to breathe in
6090,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"occasionally, like a whale; but as to living in them--"
6091,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6092,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"C.  Just hear how they spend the day.  First, 7.30, prayers in"
6093,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"church.  The dear old man has hammered on at them these forty years,"
6094,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,with a congregation averaging 4 to 2.5.
6095,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6096,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,B.  You are surely not expected to attend at that primitive

6098,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6099,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"C.  If I don't, the absence of such an important unit hurts folks'"
6100,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"feelings, and I am driven to the fabrication of excuses.  After"
6101,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"breakfast, whatever is available trots off to din the Catechism and"
6102,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,Genesis into the school-children's heads--the only things my
6103,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,respected forefather cares about teaching them.  Of course back
6104,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,again to the children's lessons.
6105,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6106,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,B.  What children?
6107,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6108,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"C.  Didn't I explain?  Three Indian orphans of my uncle's, turned"
6109,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"upon my grandfather--jolly little kids enough, as long as one hasn't"
6110,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,to teach them.
6111,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6112,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,B.  Are governesses unknown in those parts?
6113,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6114,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"C.  Too costly; and besides, my mother was designed by nature for a"
6115,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,nursery-governess.  She has taught the two elder ones to be
6116,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"wonderfully good when she is called off.  'The butcher, ma'am'; or,"
6117,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"'Mrs. Tyler wants to speak to you, ma'am'; or, 'Jane Cox is come for"
6118,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"a hospital paper, ma'am.'  Then early dinner, of all things"
6119,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"detestable, succeeded by school needlework, mothers' meeting, and"
6120,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"children's walk, combined with district visiting, or reading to old"
6121,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"women.  Church again, high tea, and evenings again pleasingly varied"
6122,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"by choir practices, night schools, or silence, while grandpapa"
6123,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,concocts his sermon.
6124,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6125,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,B.  Is this the easy life to which Mrs. Moldwarp has retired?
6126,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6127,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,C.  It is her native element.  People of her generation think it
6128,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,their vocation to be ladies-of-all-work to the parish of
6129,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,Stickinthemud cum-Humdrum.
6130,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6131,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,B.  All-work indeed!
6132,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6133,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"C.  I did not include Sundays, which are one rush of meals, schools,"
6134,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"and services, including harmonium."
6135,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6136,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"B.  No society or rational conversation, of course?"
6137,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6138,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,C.  Adjacent clergy and clergy woman rather less capable of aught
6139,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"but shop than the natives themselves!  You see, even if I did offer"
6140,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"myself as a victim, I couldn't do the thing!  Fancy my going on"
6141,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"about the six Mosaic days, and Jonah's whale, and Jael's nail, and"
6142,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,doing their duty in that state of life where it _HAS_ pleased Heaven
6143,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,to place them.
6144,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,
6145,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,"B.  Impossible, my dear!  Those things can't be taught--if they are"
6146,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,to be taught--except by those who accept them as entirely as ever;
6147,MOLDWARP AND BETTY THURSTON.,and it is absurd to think of keeping you where you would be totally

6181,SOIREE IN A LONDON DRAWING-ROOM.  PROFESSOR DUNLOP AND CECILIA.,PROF. D.  I was one of his pupils.  I may say that I owe everything

6183,SOIREE IN A LONDON DRAWING-ROOM.  PROFESSOR DUNLOP AND CECILIA.,seemed to me an ideal place.
6184,SOIREE IN A LONDON DRAWING-ROOM.  PROFESSOR DUNLOP AND CECILIA.,
6185,SOIREE IN A LONDON DRAWING-ROOM.  PROFESSOR DUNLOP AND CECILIA.,C.  Rather out of the world.
6186,SOIREE IN A LONDON DRAWING-ROOM.  PROFESSOR DUNLOP AND CECILIA.,
6187,SOIREE IN A LONDON DRAWING-ROOM.  PROFESSOR DUNLOP AND CECILIA.,PROF. D.  Of one sort of world perhaps; but what a beautiful

6189,SOIREE IN A LONDON DRAWING-ROOM.  PROFESSOR DUNLOP AND CECILIA.,lowliest work!  So entirely has he dedicated himself that he really

6516,HOLLAND AND LUCIUS.,"duty lay here, and then nothing would show her that her mother's"

6524,HOLLAND AND LUCIUS.,MRS. H.  I hope and pray that it may be so; but I am afraid that it

6538,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6539,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,MR. A.  Do you really wish it?
6540,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6541,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,C.  I don't know.  I hate it all; but if I were in the midst of
6542,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"everything again, it might stifle the pain a little."
6543,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6544,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,MR. A.  I am afraid that is not the right way of curing it.

6549,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6550,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,C.  I don't know.  It is only unbearable as it is; and yet when I
6551,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"think of my life in town, the din and the chatter and the bustle,"
6552,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"and the nobody caring, seem doubly intolerable; but I shall work off"
6553,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"that.  You had better let me go, grandpapa.  The sight of me can be"
6554,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,nothing but a grief and pain to you.
6555,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6556,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,MR. A.  No; it gives me hope.
6557,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6558,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,C.  Hope of what?
6559,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6560,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,MR. A.  That away from the whirl you will find your way to peace.
6561,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6562,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,C.  I don't see how.  Quiet only makes me more miserable.
6563,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6564,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"MR. A.  My poor child, if you can speak out and tell me exactly how"
6565,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"it is with you, I think it might be comfortable to you.  If it is"
6566,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"the missing your mother, and blaming yourself for having allowed her"
6567,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"to overdo herself, I may well share with you in that.  I feel most"
6568,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"grievously that I never perceived how much she was undertaking, nor"
6569,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,how she flagged under it.  Unselfish people want others to think for

6571,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6572,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"C.  Dear grandpapa, it would not have been too much if I had come"
6573,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,and helped.  I know that; but it is not the worst.  You can't feel
6574,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"as I do--that if my desertion led to her overworking herself, Aunt"
6575,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,Phrasie and Lucius say that what really broke her down was the

6577,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6578,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"MR. A.  I wish I could, my dear; but I cannot conceal that"
6579,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"unhappiness about you, and regret for having let you expose yourself"
6580,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"to those unfortunate arguments, broke her spirits so that her"

6583,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6584,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,C.  Poor dear mother!  And you and she can feel in that way about

6586,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,unproved.

6591,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"C.  I can't help it, grandpapa.  I read and read, till all the"

6594,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"on her belief, and grow peaceful.  They were perfect realities to"
6595,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,her; but I cannot unthink.  I would give anything to think that she
6596,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"is in perfect happiness now, and that we shall meet again; but"
6597,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,nothing seems certain to me.  All is extinguished.
6598,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6599,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,MR. A.  How do you mean?
6600,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6601,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"C.  They--Betty and her set, I mean--laughed at and argued one thing"

6604,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6605,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,MR. A.  No material grounds.
6606,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,

6610,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6611,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,C.  I saw she was; I see you are certain.  But what am I to do?  I

6613,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,
6614,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"MR. A.  Poor child, they have loosed you from the shore, because you"

6617,A MONTH LATER.  MR. AVELAND AND CECILIA.,"C.  Well, so I feel it sometimes; but if I could only feel that"

6661,CHOPS,
6662,CHOPS,You ask me why I call that old great-grandmother black cat Chops?
6663,CHOPS,"Well, thereby hangs a tale.  I don't mean the black tail which is"
6664,CHOPS,"standing upright and quivering at your caresses, but a story that"
6665,CHOPS,there will be time to tell you before Charlie gets home from market.
6666,CHOPS,
6667,CHOPS,"Seven years ago, Charlie had just finished his training both at an"
6668,CHOPS,"agricultural college and under a farmer, and was thinking of going"
6669,CHOPS,"out to Texas or to Canada, and sending for me when he should have"
6670,CHOPS,"been able to make a new home for me, when his godfather, Mr. Newton,"
6671,CHOPS,offered to let him come down and look after the draining and
6672,CHOPS,otherwise reclaiming of this great piece of waste land.  It had come
6673,CHOPS,"to Mr. Newton through some mortgages, I believe, and he thought"
6674,CHOPS,something might be made of it by an active agent.  It was the first
6675,CHOPS,"time Mr. Newton had shown the least interest in us, though he was a"
6676,CHOPS,"cousin of our poor mother's; and Charlie was very much gratified,"
6677,CHOPS,"more especially as when he had 150 pounds a year and a house, he"
6678,CHOPS,"thought I might leave the school where I was working as a teacher,"
6679,CHOPS,and make a home with him.
6680,CHOPS,
6681,CHOPS,"Yes, this is the house; but it has grown a good deal since we"
6682,CHOPS,"settled down, and will grow more before you come to it for good."
6683,CHOPS,"Then it was only meant for a superior sort of gamekeeper, and had"
6684,CHOPS,"only six rooms in it--parlour, kitchen, and back kitchen, and three"
6685,CHOPS,bedrooms above them; but this we agreed would be ample for ourselves
6686,CHOPS,"and Betsey, an old servant of our mother's, who could turn her hand"
6687,CHOPS,"to anything, and on the break-up of our home had begged to join us"
6688,CHOPS,again whenever or wherever we should have a house of our own once
6689,CHOPS,more.
6690,CHOPS,
6691,CHOPS,We have half a dozen cottages near us now; but then it seemed to us
6692,CHOPS,"like a lodge in a vast wilderness--three miles away from everything,"
6693,CHOPS,"shop, house, or church.  Betsey fairly sat down and cried when she"
6694,CHOPS,"heard how far away was the butcher, and it really seemed as if we"
6695,CHOPS,were to have the inconveniences of colonisation without the honour
6696,CHOPS,"of it.  However, contrivances made us merry; we made our rooms"
6697,CHOPS,"pretty and pleasant, and as a pony and trap were essential to"
6698,CHOPS,"Charlie in his work, we were able to fetch and carry easily."
6699,CHOPS,"Moreover, we had already a fair kitchen garden laid out, and there"
6700,CHOPS,"were outhouses for pigs and poultry, so that even while draining and"
6701,CHOPS,"fencing were going on, we raised a good proportion of our own"
6702,CHOPS,"provisions, and very proud of them we were; our own mustard and"
6703,CHOPS,"cress, which we sowed in our initials, tasted doubly sweet when we"
6704,CHOPS,reaped them as our earliest crop.
6705,CHOPS,
6706,CHOPS,Mr. Newton had always said that some day he should drop down and see
6707,CHOPS,"how Charles was getting on, but as he hardly ever stirred from his"
6708,CHOPS,"office in London, and only answered letters in the briefest and most"
6709,CHOPS,"business-like way, we had pretty well left off expecting him."
6710,CHOPS,
6711,CHOPS,"We had been here about six months, and had killed our first pig--'a"
6712,CHOPS,"pretty little porker as ever was seen,' as Betsey said.  It was hard"
6713,CHOPS,"to understand, after all the petting, admiration, and back-"
6714,CHOPS,"scratching Betsey had bestowed on him, how ready she was to sentence"
6715,CHOPS,"him, and triumph in his death; while I, feeble-minded creature,"
6716,CHOPS,delayed rising in the morning that I might cower under the
6717,CHOPS,"bedclothes and stop my ears against his dying squeals.  However,"
6718,CHOPS,"when he was no more, the housekeeping spirit triumphed in our"
6719,CHOPS,"independence of the butcher, while his fry and other delicacies"
6720,CHOPS,"lasted, and Betsey was supremely happy over the saltings of the"
6721,CHOPS,"legs, etc., with a view to the more distant future."
6722,CHOPS,
6723,CHOPS,It was a cold day of early spring.  I had been down the lanes and
6724,CHOPS,"brought in five tiny starved primroses with short stems, for which"
6725,CHOPS,"Betsey scolded me soundly, telling me that the first brood of"
6726,CHOPS,chickens was always the same in number as the first primroses
6727,CHOPS,"brought into the house.  I eked them out with moss in a saucer, and"
6728,CHOPS,"then, how well I remember the foolish, weary feeling that I wished"
6729,CHOPS,something would happen to break the quiet.  We were out of the reach
6730,CHOPS,"of new books, and the two magazines we took in would not be due for"
6731,CHOPS,ten long days.  I did not feel sensible or energetic enough to turn
6732,CHOPS,to one of the standard well-bound volumes that had been Charlie's
6733,CHOPS,"school prizes, and at the moment I hated my needlework, both steady"
6734,CHOPS,sewing and fancy work.  It was the same with my piano.  I had no new
6735,CHOPS,"fashionable music, and I was in a mood to disdain what was good and"
6736,CHOPS,"classical.  So, as the twilight came on, I sat drearily by the fire,"
6737,CHOPS,"fondling the cat--yes, this same black cat--and thinking that my"
6738,CHOPS,"life at the ladies' college had been a good deal livelier, and that"
6739,CHOPS,"if I had given it up for the sake of my brother's society, I had"
6740,CHOPS,very little of that.
6741,CHOPS,
6742,CHOPS,The hunt had gone by last week--what a treat it would be if some one
6743,CHOPS,would meet with a little accident and be carried in here!
6744,CHOPS,
6745,CHOPS,"Behold, I heard a step at the back door, and the loud call of"
6746,CHOPS,"'Kitty!  Kitty!'  There stood Charlie, as usual covered with clay"
6747,CHOPS,"nearly up to the top of his gaiters--clay either pale yellow, or"
6748,CHOPS,"horrid light blue, according to the direction of his walk.  He was"
6749,CHOPS,"beginning frantically to unbutton them, and as he beheld me he cried"
6750,CHOPS,"out, 'Kitty! he's coming!' and before I could say, 'Who?' he went"
6751,CHOPS,"on, 'Old Newton.  His fly is working through the mud in Draggletail"
6752,CHOPS,"Lane.  The driver hailed me to ask the way, and when I saw who it"
6753,CHOPS,"was, I cut across to give you notice.  He'll stay the night to a"
6754,CHOPS,dead certainty.'
6755,CHOPS,
6756,CHOPS,"What was to be done?  A wild hope seized me that, at sight of the"
6757,CHOPS,"place, he would retain his fly and go off elsewhere for better"
6758,CHOPS,accommodation.
6759,CHOPS,
6760,CHOPS,"Only, where would he find it?  The nearest town, where the only"
6761,CHOPS,"railway station then was, was eight miles off, and he was not likely"
6762,CHOPS,"to plod back thither again, and the village inn, five miles away,"
6763,CHOPS,was little more than a pot-house.
6764,CHOPS,
6765,CHOPS,"No, we must rise to the occasion, Betsey and I, while Charlie was"
6766,CHOPS,making himself respectable to receive the guest.  Where was he to
6767,CHOPS,"sleep?  What was he to eat?  A daintily fed, rather hypochrondriacal"
6768,CHOPS,"old bachelor, who seldom stirred out of his comfortable house in"
6769,CHOPS,London.  What a guest for us!
6770,CHOPS,
6771,CHOPS,The council was held while the gaiters were being unbuttoned.  He
6772,CHOPS,"must have my room, and I would sleep with Betsey.  As to food, it"
6773,CHOPS,was impossible to send to the butcher; and even if I could have
6774,CHOPS,"sacrificed my precious Dorking fowls, there would have been scant"
6775,CHOPS,time to prepare them.
6776,CHOPS,
6777,CHOPS,"There was nothing for it but to give him the pork chops, intended"
6778,CHOPS,"for our to-morrow's dinner, and if he did not like them, he might"
6779,CHOPS,fall back upon poached eggs and rashers.
6780,CHOPS,
6781,CHOPS,"'Mind,' called Charlie, as I dashed into my room to remove my"
6782,CHOPS,"properties and light the fire, so that it might get over its first"
6783,CHOPS,"smoking fit,--'mind you lock up the cat.  He hates them like"
6784,CHOPS,poison.'
6785,CHOPS,
6786,CHOPS,"It was so long before the carriage appeared, that I began half to"
6787,CHOPS,"hope, half to fear, it was a false alarm; but at last, just as it"
6788,CHOPS,"was perfectly dark, we heard it stop at the garden gate, and Charlie"
6789,CHOPS,"dashed out to open the fly door, and bring in the guest, who was"
6790,CHOPS,"panting, nervous--almost terrified, at a wild drive, so contrary to"
6791,CHOPS,"all his experiences.  When the flyman's demands had been appeased,"
6792,CHOPS,"and we had got the poor old gentleman out of his wraps, he turned"
6793,CHOPS,"out to be a neat, little, prim-looking London lawyer, clean-shaved,"
6794,CHOPS,"and with an indoor complexion.  I daresay Charlie, with his big"
6795,CHOPS,"frame, sunburnt face, curly beard, and loud hearty voice, seemed to"
6796,CHOPS,"him like a kind of savage, and he thought he had got among the"
6797,CHOPS,Aborigines.
6798,CHOPS,
6799,CHOPS,"After all, he had written to announce his coming.  But he had not"
6800,CHOPS,calculated on our never getting our letters unless we sent for them.
6801,CHOPS,"He was the very pink of politeness to me, and mourned so much over"
6802,CHOPS,putting me to inconvenience that we could only profess our delight
6803,CHOPS,and desire to make him comfortable.
6804,CHOPS,
6805,CHOPS,"On the whole, it went off very well.  I gave him a cup of tea to"
6806,CHOPS,warm and occupy him while the upstairs' chimney was coming to its
6807,CHOPS,senses; and then Charles took him upstairs.  He reappeared in
6808,CHOPS,"precise evening dress, putting us to shame; for Charles had not a"
6809,CHOPS,"dress-coat big enough for him to get into, and I had forgotten to"
6810,CHOPS,secure my black silk before abandoning my room.  We could not ask
6811,CHOPS,"him to eat in the best kitchen, as was our practice, and he showed"
6812,CHOPS,"himself rather dismayed at our having only one sitting-room, saying"
6813,CHOPS,"he had not thought the cottage such a dog-hole, or known that it"
6814,CHOPS,would be inhabited by a lady; and then he paid some pretty
6815,CHOPS,compliment on the feminine hand evident in the room.  We had laid
6816,CHOPS,"the table before he came down, but the waiting was managed by"
6817,CHOPS,"ourselves, or rather, by Charles, for Mr. Newton's politeness made"
6818,CHOPS,him jump up whenever I moved; so that I had to sit still and do the
6819,CHOPS,"lady hostess, while my brother changed plates and brought in relays"
6820,CHOPS,of the chops from the kitchen.  They were a great success.  Mr.
6821,CHOPS,"Newton eyed them for a moment distrustfully, but Betsey had turned"
6822,CHOPS,"them out beautifully--all fair and delicate with transparent fat,"
6823,CHOPS,and a brown stripe telling of the gridiron.  He refused the egg
6824,CHOPS,"alternative, and greatly enjoyed them and our Brussels sprouts,"
6825,CHOPS,"speaking highly of the pleasure of country fare, and apologising"
6826,CHOPS,"about the good appetising effects of a journey, when Charlie tempted"
6827,CHOPS,"him with a third chop, the hottest and most perfect of all."
6828,CHOPS,
6829,CHOPS,"I think we also produced a rhubarb tart, and I know he commended our"
6830,CHOPS,"prudence in having no wine, and though he refused my brother's ale,"
6831,CHOPS,"seemed highly satisfied with a tumbler of brandy and water, when I"
6832,CHOPS,"quitted the gentlemen to see to the coffee, while they talked over"
6833,CHOPS,"the scheme for farm-buildings, which Charlie had sent up to him."
6834,CHOPS,
6835,CHOPS,"When I bade him good-night, a couple of hours later, he was"
6836,CHOPS,"evidently in a serene state of mind, regarding us as very superior"
6837,CHOPS,young people.
6838,CHOPS,
6839,CHOPS,"In the middle of the night, Betsey and I were appalled by a"
6840,CHOPS,tremendous knocking on the wall.  I threw on a dressing-gown and
6841,CHOPS,"made for the door, while Betsey felt for the matches.  As I opened a"
6842,CHOPS,"crack of the door, Charlie's voice was to be heard, 'Yes, yes; I'll"
6843,CHOPS,"get you some, sir.  You'll be better presently,' interspersed with"
6844,CHOPS,"heavy groans; then, seeing me wide awake, he begged that Betsey"
6845,CHOPS,"would go down and get some hot water--'and mustard,' called out a"
6846,CHOPS,"suffering voice.  'Oh, those chops!'"
6847,CHOPS,
6848,CHOPS,"Poor Mr. Newton had, it appeared, wakened with a horrible oppression"
6849,CHOPS,"on his chest, and at once attributing it to his unwonted meal of"
6850,CHOPS,"pork chops, he had begun, in the dark, knocking and calling with"
6851,CHOPS,"great energy.  Charlie had stumbled in in the dark, not waiting to"
6852,CHOPS,"light a candle, and indeed ours were chiefly lamps, which took time"
6853,CHOPS,"to light.  Betsey had hers, however, and had bustled into some"
6854,CHOPS,"clothes, tumbling downstairs to see whether any water were still hot"
6855,CHOPS,"in the copper, Charlie running down to help her, while I fumbled"
6856,CHOPS,"about for a lamp and listened with awe to the groans from within,"
6857,CHOPS,wondering which of us would have to go for the doctor.
6858,CHOPS,
6859,CHOPS,"Up came Charlie, in his shirt sleeves, with a steaming jug in one"
6860,CHOPS,"hand and a lamp in the other.  Up came Betsey, in a scarlet"
6861,CHOPS,"petticoat and plaid shawl, her gray locks in curl-papers, and a"
6862,CHOPS,"tallow-candle in hand.  The door was thrown open, Charlie observing,"
6863,CHOPS,
6864,CHOPS,"'Now, sir,' then breaking out into 'Thunder and turf' (his favourite"
6865,CHOPS,"Hibernian ejaculation); 'Ssssssss!' and therewith, her green eyes"
6866,CHOPS,"all one glare, out burst this cat!  She was the nightmare!  She had"
6867,CHOPS,"been sitting on the unfortunate man's chest, and all her weight had"
6868,CHOPS,been laid to the score of the chops!
6869,CHOPS,
6870,CHOPS,"No doubt she had been attracted by the fire, stolen up in the"
6871,CHOPS,"confusion of the house, remained hidden whilst Mr. Newton was going"
6872,CHOPS,"to bed, and when the fire went out, settled herself on his chest, as"
6873,CHOPS,"it seems he slept on his back, and it was a warm position."
6874,CHOPS,
6875,CHOPS,"Probably his knockings on the wall dislodged her; but if so,"
6876,CHOPS,"imagination carried on the sense of oppression, and with feline"
6877,CHOPS,pertinacity she had returned as soon as he was still again.
6878,CHOPS,
6879,CHOPS,Poor old gentleman!  I am afraid he heard some irrepressible
6880,CHOPS,"laughter, and it was very sore to him to be ridiculous.  His grave"
6881,CHOPS,dignity and politeness when he came down very late the next morning
6882,CHOPS,"were something awful, and it must have been very dreadful to him"
6883,CHOPS,that he could not get away till half the day was over.
6884,CHOPS,
6885,CHOPS,So dry and short was he over matters of business that Charles
6886,CHOPS,actually thought we might begin to pack up and make our arrangements
6887,CHOPS,"for emigrating.  Grave, dry, and civil as ever, he departed, and I"
6888,CHOPS,"never saw him more, nor do I think he ever entirely forgave me."
6889,CHOPS,"There did not, however, come any dismissal, and when Charlie had"
6890,CHOPS,"occasion to go up to his office and see him, he was just the same as"
6891,CHOPS,"ever, and acceded to the various arrangements which have made this a"
6892,CHOPS,"civilised, though still rather remote place."
6893,CHOPS,
6894,CHOPS,"And when he died, a year ago, to our surprise we found that this"
6895,CHOPS,same reclaimed property was left to my brother.  The consequence
6896,CHOPS,"whereof you well know, my dear little sister that is to be.  Poor"
6897,CHOPS,"old Chops! you had nearly marred our fortunes; and now, will you go"
6898,CHOPS,"with me to my home at the Rectory, or do you prefer your old abode"
6899,CHOPS,to your old mistress?
