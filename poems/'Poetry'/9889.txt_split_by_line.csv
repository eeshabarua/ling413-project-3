29,INTRODUCTION,"""It is about impossible for a man to get rid of his Puritan grandfathers,"
30,INTRODUCTION,"and nobody who has ever had one has ever escaped his Puritan grandmother;"""
31,INTRODUCTION,"so said Eugene Field to me one sweet April day, when we talked together of"
32,INTRODUCTION,the things of the spirit. It is one of his own confessions that he was
33,INTRODUCTION,fond of clergymen. Most preachers are supposed to be helplessly tied up
34,INTRODUCTION,with such a set of limitations that there are but a few jokes which they
35,INTRODUCTION,"may tolerate, and a small number of delights into which they may enter."
36,INTRODUCTION,"Doubtless many a cheerful soul likes to meet such of the clergy, in order"
37,INTRODUCTION,"that the worldling may feel the contrast of liberty with bondage, and"
38,INTRODUCTION,"demonstrate by bombardment of wit and humor, how intellectually thin are"
39,INTRODUCTION,the walls against which certain forms of skepticism and fun offend. Eugene
40,INTRODUCTION,"Field did not belong to these. He called them ""a tribe which do unseemly"
41,INTRODUCTION,"beset the saints."" Nobody has ever had a more numerous or loving clientage"
42,INTRODUCTION,"of friendship among the ministers of this city than the author of ""The"
43,INTRODUCTION,"Holy Cross"" and ""The Little Yaller Baby."" Those of this number who were"
44,INTRODUCTION,closest to the full-hearted singer know that beneath and within all his
45,INTRODUCTION,exquisite wit and ludicrous raillery--so often directed against the
46,INTRODUCTION,"shallow formalist, or the unctuous hypocrite--there were an aspiration"
47,INTRODUCTION,"toward the divine, and a desire for what is often slightingly called"
48,INTRODUCTION,"""religious conversation,"" as sincere as it was resistless within him. My"
49,INTRODUCTION,own first remembrance of him brings back a conversation which ended in a
50,INTRODUCTION,"prayer, and the last sight I had of him was when he said, only four days"
51,INTRODUCTION,"before his death, ""Well, then, we will set the day soon and you will come"
52,INTRODUCTION,"out and baptize the children."""
53,INTRODUCTION,
54,INTRODUCTION,Some of the most humorous of his letters which have come under the
55,INTRODUCTION,"observation of his clerical friends, were addressed to the secretary of"
56,INTRODUCTION,one of them. Some little business matters with regard to his readings and
57,INTRODUCTION,the like had acquainted him with a better kind of handwriting than he had
58,INTRODUCTION,"been accustomed to receive from his pastor, and, noting the finely"
59,INTRODUCTION,"appended signature, ""per ---- ----,"" Field wrote a most effusively"
60,INTRODUCTION,"complimentary letter to his ministerial friend, congratulating him upon"
61,INTRODUCTION,"the fact that emanations from his office, or parochial study, were ""now"
62,INTRODUCTION,"readable as far West as Buena Park."" At length, nothing having appeared in"
63,INTRODUCTION,writing by which he might discover that ---- ---- was a lady of his own
64,INTRODUCTION,"acquaintance, she whose valuable services he desired to recognize was made"
65,INTRODUCTION,the recipient of a series of beautifully illuminated and daintily written
66,INTRODUCTION,"letters, all of them quaintly begun, continued, and ended in"
67,INTRODUCTION,"ecclesiastical terminology, most of them having to do with affairs in"
68,INTRODUCTION,"which the two gentlemen only were primarily interested, the larger number"
69,INTRODUCTION,"of them addressed in English to ""Brother ----,"" in care of the minister,"
70,INTRODUCTION,and yet others directed in Latin:

88,ILLINOIS.,or less jealousy between the presidents of the two south side institutions
89,ILLINOIS.,"of learning, I take it upon myself to invite the lord bishop of"
90,ILLINOIS.,"Armourville, our holy père, to be present on that occasion in his"
91,ILLINOIS.,"pontifical robes and followed by all the dignitaries of his see, including"
92,ILLINOIS.,"yourself. The processional will occur at 8 o'clock sharp, and the"
93,ILLINOIS.,"recessional circa 9:30. Pax vobiscum. Salute the holy Father with a kiss,"

104,EUGENIO AGRO.,"On an occasion of this lady's visit to the South-west, where Field's"
105,EUGENIO AGRO.,"fancied association of cowboys and miners was formed, she was fortunate"
106,EUGENIO AGRO.,enough to obtain for the decoration of his library the rather
107,EUGENIO AGRO.,extraordinary Indian blanket which often appears in the sketches of his
108,EUGENIO AGRO.,"loved workshop, and for the decoration of himself a very fine necktie made"
109,EUGENIO AGRO.,of the skin of a diamond-back rattlesnake. Some other friend had given his
110,EUGENIO AGRO.,"boys a ""vociferant burro."" After the presentation was made, though for two"
111,EUGENIO AGRO.,"years he had met her socially and at the pastor's office, he wrote to the"
112,EUGENIO AGRO.,"secretary, in acknowledgment, as follows:"
113,EUGENIO AGRO.,
114,EUGENIO AGRO.,
115,EUGENIO AGRO.,DEAR BROTHER ----: I thank you most heartily for the handsome specimens of
116,EUGENIO AGRO.,heathen manufacture which you brought with you for me out of the land of
117,EUGENIO AGRO.,"Nod. Mrs. Field is quite charmed--with the blanket, but I think I prefer"
118,EUGENIO AGRO.,"the necktie; the Old Adam predominates in me, and this pelt of the serpent"
119,EUGENIO AGRO.,appeals with peculiar force to my appreciation of the vicious and the
120,EUGENIO AGRO.,sinful. Nearly every morning I don that necktie and go out and twist the
121,EUGENIO AGRO.,supersensitive tail of our intelligent imported burro until the profane
122,EUGENIO AGRO.,beast burthens the air with his ribald protests. I shall ask the holy
123,EUGENIO AGRO.,father--Pere ---- to bring you with him when he comes again to pay a
124,EUGENIO AGRO.,parochial visit to my house. I have a fair and gracious daughter into
125,EUGENIO AGRO.,whose companionship I would fain bring so circumspect and diligent a young
126,EUGENIO AGRO.,"man as the holy father represents you to be. Therefore, without fear or"
127,EUGENIO AGRO.,trembling accompany that saintly man whensoever he says the word. Thereby
128,EUGENIO AGRO.,you shall further make me your debtor. I send you every assurance of
129,EUGENIO AGRO.,"cordial regard, and I beg you to salute the holy father for me with a"
130,EUGENIO AGRO.,"kiss, and may peace be unto his house and unto all that dwell therein."

143,"CHICAGO, MAY 26, 1892.","he did, he hunted up an old number of Peterson's Magazine, containing a"
144,"CHICAGO, MAY 26, 1892.","very highly colored and elaborate pattern for knit slippers, such as"
145,"CHICAGO, MAY 26, 1892.","clergymen received at Christmas thirty years ago, and, inclosing it with"
146,"CHICAGO, MAY 26, 1892.","utmost care, he forwarded it to the aforesaid ""Brother ----"" with this"

149,"CHICAGO, MAY 26, 1892.",DEAR BROTHER ----: It has occurred to me that maybe the sisters of our

151,"CHICAGO, MAY 26, 1892.","Christmas; so I inclose a lovely pattern for slippers, and I shall be glad"
152,"CHICAGO, MAY 26, 1892.","to ante up my share of the expense, if the sisters decide to give our dear"
153,"CHICAGO, MAY 26, 1892.",pastor this beautiful gift. I should like the pattern better if it had
154,"CHICAGO, MAY 26, 1892.","more red in it, but it will do very nicely. As I intend to go to"
155,"CHICAGO, MAY 26, 1892.","California very soon, you'll have to let me know at once what the"
156,"CHICAGO, MAY 26, 1892.","assessment _per cap._ is, or the rest of the sisters will be compelled to"

167,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.","This was only one phase of the life of this great-hearted man, as it came"
168,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.",close to his friends in the ministry. Other clergymen who knew him well
169,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.",will not forget his overflowing kindness in times of sickness and
170,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.",weariness. At least one will not forget the last day of their meeting and
171,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.","the ardor of the poet's prayer. Religion, as the Christian life, was not"
172,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.",less sacred to him because he knew how poorly men achieve the task of
173,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.","living always at the best level, nor did the reality of the soul's"
174,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.",approach to God grow less noble or commanding to him because he knew that
175,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.",too seldom do we lift our voices heavenward. I am permitted to copy this
176,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.","one letter addressed to a clerical friend, at a time when Eugene Field"
177,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.",responded to the call of that undying puritanism in his blood:
178,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.",
179,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.","DEAR, DEAR FRIEND: I was greatly shocked to read in the Post last night of"
180,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.",your dangerous illness. It is so seldom that I pray that when I do God
181,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.",knows I am in earnest. I do not pester Him with small matters. It is only
182,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.",when I am in real want that I get down on my wicked knees and pray. And
183,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.","I prayed for you last night, dear friend, for your friendship--the help"
184,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.","that it is to me--is what I need, and I cannot be bereft of it. God has"
185,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.","always been good to me, and He has said yes to my prayer, I am sure."
186,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.","Others, too--thousands of them--are praying for you, and for your"
187,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.",restoration to health; none other has had in it more love and loyalty than
188,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.","my prayer had, and none other, dear friend, among the thousands whom you"
189,"BUENA PARK, ILL., DECEMBER 4, 1893.","have blessed with your sweet friendship, loves you better than I do."

193,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",
194,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",I am still sick abed and I find it hard to think out and write a letter.
195,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",Read between the lines and the love there will comfort you more than my
196,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",faulty words can.
197,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",
198,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","I have often thought, as I saw him through his later years espousing the"
199,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","noblest causes with true-hearted zeal, of what he once said in the old"
200,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","""Saints' and Sinners' Corner"" when a conversation sprang up on the death"
201,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",of Professor David Swing. His words go far to explain to me that somewhat
202,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",reckless humor which oftentimes made it seem that he loved to imitate and
203,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",hold in the pillory of his own inimitable powers of mimicry some of the
204,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",least attractive forms of the genus _parson_ he had seen and known. He
205,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","said: ""A good many things I do and say are things I have to employ to keep"
206,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",down the intention of those who wanted me to be a parson. I guess their
207,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","desire got into my blood, too, for I have always to preach some little"
208,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","verses or I cannot get through Christmastide."""
209,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",
210,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",He had to get on with blood which was exquisitely harmonious with the
211,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",heart of the Christ. He was not only a born member of the Society for the
212,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","Prevention of Sorrow to Mankind, but he was by nature a champion of a"
213,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",working Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. This society was
214,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",composed of himself. He wished to enlarge the membership of this latter
215,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","association, but nobody was as orthodox in the faith as to the nobility of"
216,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","a balky horse, and he found none as intolerant of ill-treatment toward any"
217,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","and every brute, as was he. Professor Swing had written and read at the"
218,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","Parliament of Religions an essay on the Humane Treatment of the Brutes,"
219,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","which became a classic before the ink was dry, and one day Field proposed"
220,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",to him and another clergyman that they begin a practical crusade. On those
221,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","cold days, drivers were demanding impossible things of smooth-shod horses"
222,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","on icy streets, and he saw many a noble beast on his knees, ""begging me,"""
223,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","as he said, ""to get him a priest."" Field's scheme was that the delicate"
224,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","and intelligent seer, David Swing, and his less refined and less gentle"
225,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",contemporary should go with him to the City Hall and be sworn in as
226,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","special policemen and ""do up these fellows."" His clear blue eye was like a"
227,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","palpitating morning sky, and his whole thin and tall frame shook with"
228,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","passionate missionary zeal. ""Ah,"" said he, as the beloved knight of the"
229,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",unorthodox explained that if he undertook the proposed task he would
230,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","surely have to abandon all other work, ""I never was satisfied that you"
231,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","were orthodox."" His other friend had already fallen in his estimate as to"
232,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","fitness for such work. For, had not Eugene Field once started out to pay a"
233,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","bill of fifteen dollars, and had he not met a semblance of a man on the"
234,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",street who was beating a lengthily under-jawed and bad-eyed bull-dog of
235,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","his own, for some misdemeanor? ""Yea, verily,"" confessed the poet-humorist,"
236,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","who was then a reformer. ""Why didn't you have him arrested, Eugene?"" ""Why,"
237,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","well, I was going jingling along with some new verses in my heart, and I"
238,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","knew I'd lose the _tempo_ if I became militant. I said, 'What'll you take"
239,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","for him?' The pup was so homely that his face ached, but, as I was in a"
240,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","hurry to get to work, I gave him the fifteen dollars, and took the beast"
241,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","to the office."" For a solitary remark uttered at the conclusion of this"
242,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",relation and fully confirmed as to its justness by an observation of the
243,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","dog, his only other human prop for this enterprise was discarded. ""Oh, you"
244,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","won't do,"" he said."
245,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",
246,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",Christianity was increasingly dear to him as the discovery of childhood
247,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",and the unfolding of its revelations. Into what long disquisitions he
248,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","delighted to go, estimating the probable value of the idea that all"
249,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",returning to righteousness must be a child's returning. He saw what an
250,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",influence such a conception has upon the hard and fast lines of habit and
251,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",destiny to melt them down. He had a still greater estimate of the
252,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",importance of the fact that Jesus of Nazareth came and lived as a child;
253,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","and the dream of the last year of his life was to write, in the mood of"
254,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","the Holy-Cross tale, a sketch of the early years of the Little Galilean"
255,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",Peasant-Boy. This vision drifted its light into all his pictures of
256,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","children at the last. He knew the ""Old Adam"" in us all, especially as he"
257,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","reappeared in the little folk. ""But I don't believe the depravity is"
258,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","total, do you?"" he said, ""else a child would not care to hear about Mary's"
259,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","Little One;""--and then he would go on, following the Carpenter's Son about"
260,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","the cottage and over the hill, and rejoicing that, in following Him thus,"
261,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","he came back to his own open-eyed childhood, ""But, you know,"" said he,"
262,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","""my childhood was full of the absurdities and strenuosities"" (this last"
263,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","was his word) ""of my puritan surroundings. Why, I never knew how naturally"
264,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",and easily I can get back into the veins of an old puritan grandfather
265,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",that one of my grandmothers must have had--and how hard it is for me to
266,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","behave there, until I read Alice Morse Earle's 'The Sabbath in New"
267,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","England.' I read that book nearly all night, if haply I might subdue the"
268,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",confusion and sorrows that were wrought in me by eating a Christmas pie on
269,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","that feast-day. The fact is, my immediate ecclesiastical belongings are"
270,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",Episcopalian. I am of the church of Archbishop Laud and King Charles of
271,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","blessed memory. I like good, thick Christmas pie, 'reeking with sapid"
272,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","juices,' full-ripe and zealous for good or ill. But my 'Separatist'"
273,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","ancestors all mistook gastric difficulties for spiritual graces, and,"
274,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","living in me, they all revolt and want to sail in the Mayflower, or hold"
275,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","town-meetings inside of me after feast-day."""
276,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",
277,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","Then, as if he had it in his mind,--poor, pale, yellow-skinned sufferer,--"
278,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","to attract one to the book he delighted in, he related that he fell asleep"
279,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","with this delicious volume in his hand, and this is part of the dream he"
280,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",sketched afterward:
281,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",
282,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","""I went alone to the meeting-house the which those who are sinfully"
283,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","inclined toward Rome would call a 'church,' and it was on the Sabbath day."
284,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",I yearned and strove to repent me of the merry mood and full sorry humors
285,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",of Christmastide. For did not Judge Sewall make public his confession of
286,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",having an overwhelming sense of inward condemnation for having opposed the
287,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",Almighty with the witches of Salem? I fancied that one William F. Poole
288,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","of the Newberry Library went also to comfort me and strengthen, as he"
289,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","would fain have done for the Judge. Not one of us carried a cricket,"
290,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",though Friend Poole related that he had left behind a 'seemly brassen
291,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","foot-stove' full of hot coals from his hearthstone. On the day before,"
292,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","Pelitiah Underwood, the wolf-killer, had destroyed a fierce beast; and now"
293,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",the head thereof was 'nayled to the meetinghouse with a notice thereof.'
294,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",It grinned at me and spit forth fire such as I felt within me. I was glad
295,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","to enter the house, which was 'lathed on the inside and so daubed and"
296,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","whitened over workmanlike.' I had not been there, as it bethought me,"
297,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","since the day of the raising, when Jonathan Strong did 'break his thy,'"
298,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","and when all made complaint that only £9 had been spent for liquor, punch,"
299,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","beere, and flip, for the raising, whereas, on the day of the ordination,"
300,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","even at supper-time, besides puddings of corn meal and 'sewet baked"
301,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","therein, pyes, tarts, beare-stake and deer-meat,' there were 'cyder,"
302,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","rum-bitters, sling, old Barbadoes spirit, and Josslyn's nectar, made of"
303,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","Maligo raisins, spices, and syrup of clove gillyflowers'--all these given"
304,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",out freely to the worshippers over a newly made bar at the church door--
305,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","God be praised! As I mused on this merry ordination, the sounding-board"
306,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","above the pulpit appeared as if to fall upon the pulpit, whereon I read,"
307,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",after much effort: '_Holiness is the Lord's_.' The tassels and carved
308,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",pomegranates on the sounding-board became living creatures and changed
309,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","themselves into grimaces, and I was woefully wrought upon by the red"
310,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","cushion on the pulpit, which did seem a bag of fire. As the minister was"
311,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","heard coming up the winding stairs unseen, and, yet more truly, as his"
312,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","head at length appeared through the open trap-doorway, I thought him"
313,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","Satan, and, but for friend Poole, I had cried out lustily in fear. Terror"
314,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",fled me when I considered that none might do any harm there. For was not
315,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","the church militant now assembled? Besides, had they not obeyed the law of"
316,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",the General Court that each congregation should carry a 'competent number
317,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","of pieces, fixed and complete with powder and shot and swords, every"
318,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","Lord's-day at the meeting-house?' And, right well equipped 'with"
319,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","psalm-book, shot and powder-horn' sat that doughty man, Shear Yashub"
320,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",Millard along with Hezekiah Bristol and four others whose issue I have
321,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",known pleasantly in the flesh here; and those of us who had no pieces wore
322,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","'coats basted with cotton-wool, and thus made defensive against Indian"
323,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",arrows.' Yet it bethought me that there was no defence against what I had
324,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","devoured on Christmas day. I had rather been the least of these,--even he"
325,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",who 'blew the Kunk'--than to be thus seated there and afeared that the
326,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",brethren in the 'pitts' doubted I had true religion. That I had found a
327,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","proper seat--even this I wot not; and I quaked, for had not two of my kin"
328,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",been fined near unto poverty for 'disorderly going and setting in seats
329,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","not theirs by any means,' so great was their sin. It had not yet come upon"
330,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",the day when there was a 'dignifying of the meeting.' Did not even the
331,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",pious Judge Sewall's second spouse once sit in the foreseat when he
332,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","thought to have taken her into 'his own pue?' and, she having died in a"
333,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","few months, did not that godly man exclaim: 'God in his holy Sovereignity"
334,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",put my wife out of the Foreseat'? Was I not also in recollection by many
335,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","as one who once 'prophaned the Lord's Day in ye meeting-house, in ye times"
336,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","of ye forenoone service, by my rude and Indecent acting in Laughing and"
337,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","other Doings by my face with Tabatha Morgus, against ye peace of our"
338,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","Sovereign Lord ye King, His crown and Dignity?'"""
339,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",
340,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","At this, it appears that I groaned in my sleep, for I was not only asleep"
341,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","here and now, but I was dreaming that I was asleep there and then, in the"
342,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",meeting-house. It was in this latter sleep that I groaned so heavily in
343,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","spirit and in body that the tithing-man, or awakener, did approach me from"
344,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","behind, without stopping to brush me to awakening by the fox-taile which"
345,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","was fixed to the end of his long staffe, or even without painfully"
346,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",sticking into my body his sharp and pricking staffe which he did sometimes
347,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","use. He led me out bodily to the noone-house, where I found myself fully"
348,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","awakened, but much broken in spirit. Then and there did I write these"
349,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","verses, which I send to you:"
350,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",
351,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","""Mother,"" says I, ""is that a pie?"" in tones akin to scorning;"

353,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","It's fat with plums as big as your thumbs, reeking with sapid juices,"
354,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","And you'll find within all kinds of sin our grocery store produces!"""
355,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","""O, well,"" says I,"

361,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",
362,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","But once a year comes Christmas cheer, and one should then be merry,"
363,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","But as for me, as you can see, I'm disconcerted, very;"
364,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","For that pesky pie sticks grimly by my organs of digestion,"
365,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.",And that 't will stay by me till May or June I make no question.
366,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","So unto you,"
367,"BUENA PARK, NOVEMBER 15, 1893.","Good friends and true,"

653,TO CINNA,So far away in space

655,TO CINNA,Nor feel its soothing grace--
656,TO CINNA,Perhaps from that far-distant sphere
657,TO CINNA,Her quickened vision seeks
658,TO CINNA,For this poor heart of mine that here
659,TO CINNA,To its lost Cinna speaks.
660,TO CINNA,
661,TO CINNA,"Then search this heart, beloved eyes,"
662,TO CINNA,And find it still as true

665,TO CINNA,"Cinna, you know the mystery"

798,MARY SMITH,
799,MARY SMITH,"Away down East where I was reared amongst my Yankee kith,"
800,MARY SMITH,There used to live a pretty girl whose name was Mary Smith;
801,MARY SMITH,"And though it's many years since last I saw that pretty girl,"
802,MARY SMITH,And though I feel I'm sadly worn by Western strife and whirl;
803,MARY SMITH,"Still, oftentimes, I think about the old familiar place,"
804,MARY SMITH,"Which, someway, seemed the brighter for Miss Mary's pretty face,"
805,MARY SMITH,And in my heart I feel once more revivified the glow
806,MARY SMITH,I used to feel in those old times when I was Mary's beau.
807,MARY SMITH,
808,MARY SMITH,I saw her home from singing school--she warbled like a bird.
809,MARY SMITH,A sweeter voice than hers for song or speech I never heard.
810,MARY SMITH,"She was soprano in the choir, and I a solemn bass,"
811,MARY SMITH,And when we unisoned our voices filled that holy place;
812,MARY SMITH,"The tenor and the alto never had the slightest chance,"
813,MARY SMITH,For Mary's upper register made every heart-string dance;
814,MARY SMITH,"And, as for me, I shall not brag, and yet I'd have you know"
815,MARY SMITH,I sung a very likely bass when I was Mary's beau.
816,MARY SMITH,
817,MARY SMITH,"On Friday nights I'd drop around to make my weekly call,"
818,MARY SMITH,"And though I came to visit her, I'd have to see 'em all."
819,MARY SMITH,"With Mary's mother sitting here and Mary's father there,"
820,MARY SMITH,The conversation never flagged so far as I'm aware;
821,MARY SMITH,"Sometimes I'd hold her worsted, sometimes we'd play at games,"
822,MARY SMITH,Sometimes dissect the apples which we'd named each other's names.
823,MARY SMITH,Oh how I loathed the shrill-toned clock that told me when to go--
824,MARY SMITH,'Twas ten o'clock at half-past eight when I was Mary's beau.
825,MARY SMITH,
826,MARY SMITH,Now there was Luther Baker--because he'd come of age
827,MARY SMITH,And thought himself some pumpkins because he drove the stage--
828,MARY SMITH,He fancied he could cut me out; but Mary was my friend--
829,MARY SMITH,Elsewise I'm sure the issue had had a tragic end.
830,MARY SMITH,"For Luther Baker was a man I never could abide,"
831,MARY SMITH,"And, when it came to Mary, either he or I had died."
832,MARY SMITH,I merely cite this instance incidentally to show
833,MARY SMITH,That I was quite in earnest when I was Mary's beau.
834,MARY SMITH,
835,MARY SMITH,"How often now those sights, those pleasant sights, recur again:"
836,MARY SMITH,The little township that was all the world I knew of then--
837,MARY SMITH,"The meeting-house upon the hill, the tavern just beyond,"
838,MARY SMITH,"Old deacon Packard's general store, the sawmill by the pond,"
839,MARY SMITH,The village elms I vainly sought to conquer in my quest
840,MARY SMITH,"Of that surpassing trophy, the golden oriole's nest."
841,MARY SMITH,"And, last of all those visions that come back from long ago,"
842,MARY SMITH,The pretty face that thrilled my soul when I was Mary's beau.
843,MARY SMITH,
844,MARY SMITH,"Hush, gentle wife, there is no need a pang should vex your heart--"
845,MARY SMITH,'T is many years since fate ordained that she and I should part;
846,MARY SMITH,"To each a true, maturer love came in good time, and yet"
847,MARY SMITH,It brought not with its nobler grace the power to forget.
848,MARY SMITH,And would you fain begrudge me now the sentimental joy
849,MARY SMITH,That comes of recollections of my sparkings when a boy?
850,MARY SMITH,"I warrant me that, were your heart put to the rack, 't would show"
851,MARY SMITH,That it had predilections when I was Mary's beau.
852,MARY SMITH,
853,MARY SMITH,"And, Mary, should these lines of mine seek out your biding place,"
854,MARY SMITH,God grant they bring the old sweet smile back to your pretty face--
855,MARY SMITH,"God grant they bring you thoughts of me, not as I am to-day,"
856,MARY SMITH,With faltering step and brimming eyes and aspect grimly gray;
857,MARY SMITH,But thoughts that picture me as fair and full of life and glee
858,MARY SMITH,As _we_ were in the olden times--as _you_ shall always be.
859,MARY SMITH,"Think of me ever, Mary, as the boy you used to know"
860,MARY SMITH,"When time was fleet, and life was sweet, and I was Mary's beau."
861,MARY SMITH,
862,MARY SMITH,"Dear hills of old New England, look down with tender eyes"
863,MARY SMITH,Upon one little lonely grave that in your bosom lies;
864,MARY SMITH,For in that cradle sleeps a child who was so fair to see
865,MARY SMITH,God yearned to have unto Himself the joy she brought to me;
866,MARY SMITH,"And bid your winds sing soft and low the song of other days,"
867,MARY SMITH,"When, hand in hand and heart to heart, we went our pleasant ways--"
868,MARY SMITH,"Ah me! but could I sing again that song of long ago,"
869,MARY SMITH,Instead of this poor idle song of being Mary's beau.

890,JESSIE,"Admit it, all ye gallant squires--"
891,JESSIE,There are no eyes like Jessie's.

893,JESSIE,Her voice (like liquid beams that roll
894,JESSIE,From moonland to the river)
895,JESSIE,"Steals subtly to the raptured soul,"
896,JESSIE,Therein to lie and quiver;
897,JESSIE,Or falls upon the grateful ear
898,JESSIE,With chaste and warm caresses--
899,JESSIE,"Ah, all concede the truth (who hear):"
900,JESSIE,There's no such voice as Jessie's.
901,JESSIE,
902,JESSIE,Of other charms she hath such store
903,JESSIE,"All rivalry excelling,"
904,JESSIE,"Though I used adjectives galore,"
905,JESSIE,They'd fail me in the telling;
906,JESSIE,But now discretion stays my hand--
907,JESSIE,"Adieu, eyes, voice, and tresses."

1058,THE STODDARDS,He waves me to an easy chair and hands me out a weed
1059,THE STODDARDS,And pumps me full of that advice he seems to know I need;
1060,THE STODDARDS,So sweet the tap of his philosophy and knowledge flows
1061,THE STODDARDS,That I can't help wishing that I knew a half what Stoddard knows.
1062,THE STODDARDS,
1063,THE STODDARDS,"And so we sit for hours and hours, praising without restraint"

1066,THE STODDARDS,"But wretched, oh, how wretched he that hath provoked our ire;"
1067,THE STODDARDS,"For I speak emphatic English when I once get fairly r'iled,"
1068,THE STODDARDS,And Stoddard's wrath's an Ossa upon a Pelion piled.
1069,THE STODDARDS,
1070,THE STODDARDS,"Out yonder, in the alcove, a lady sits and darns,"
1071,THE STODDARDS,And interjects remarks that always serve to spice our yarns;
1072,THE STODDARDS,She's Mrs. Stoddard; there's a dame that's truly to my heart:
1073,THE STODDARDS,"A tiny little woman, but so quaint, and good, and smart"
1074,THE STODDARDS,"That, if you asked me to suggest which one I should prefer"
1075,THE STODDARDS,"Of all the Stoddard treasures, I should promptly mention her."
1076,THE STODDARDS,

1078,THE STODDARDS,"Down in your home in Fifteenth street, where all is snug and bright;"
1079,THE STODDARDS,"Where the shaggy little Cerberus dreams in its cushioned place,"
1080,THE STODDARDS,And the books and pictures all around smile in their old friend's face;

1090,THE THREE TAILORS,"On the Rhine, lovely Rhine;"
1091,THE THREE TAILORS,"They were broke, but the worst of it all, they were curst"
1092,THE THREE TAILORS,With that malady common to tailors--a thirst

1112,THE THREE TAILORS,"And, in such a deft way, patched a mirror that day"
1113,THE THREE TAILORS,That where it was mended no expert could say--

1115,THE THREE TAILORS,
1116,THE THREE TAILORS,The second thereat spied a poor little gnat
1117,THE THREE TAILORS,Go toiling along on his nose broad and flat

1121,THE THREE TAILORS,"All for wine, soothing wine."
1122,THE THREE TAILORS,
1123,THE THREE TAILORS,And next there occurred what you'll deem quite absurd--
1124,THE THREE TAILORS,"His needle a space in the wall thrust the third,"
1125,THE THREE TAILORS,"By the Rhine, wondrous Rhine;"
1126,THE THREE TAILORS,"And then all so spry, he leapt through the eye"
1127,THE THREE TAILORS,"Of that thin cambric needle--nay, think you I'd lie"
1128,THE THREE TAILORS,About wine--not for wine.
1129,THE THREE TAILORS,
1130,THE THREE TAILORS,The landlord allowed (with a smile) he was proud
1131,THE THREE TAILORS,To do the fair thing by that talented crowd
1132,THE THREE TAILORS,"On the Rhine, generous Rhine."
1133,THE THREE TAILORS,So a thimble filled he as full as could be--

1794,THE DREAMS,"Oh, sweet was the music the robins made"
1795,THE DREAMS,To the springtime everywhere!
1796,THE DREAMS,
1797,THE DREAMS,Was it the dew the dream had brought
1798,THE DREAMS,"From yonder midnight skies,"
1799,THE DREAMS,"Or was it tears from the dear, dead years"
1800,THE DREAMS,That lay in the dreamer's eyes?
1801,THE DREAMS,
1802,THE DREAMS,"The _other_ dream ran fast and free,"
1803,THE DREAMS,As the moon benignly shed
1804,THE DREAMS,Her golden grace on the smiling face
1805,THE DREAMS,In the little trundle-bed.
1806,THE DREAMS,
1807,THE DREAMS,For 't was a dream of times to come--
1808,THE DREAMS,Of the glorious noon of day--
1809,THE DREAMS,Of the summer that follows the careless spring
1810,THE DREAMS,When the child is done with play.
1811,THE DREAMS,
1812,THE DREAMS,And 't was a dream of the busy world
1813,THE DREAMS,Where valorous deeds are done;
1814,THE DREAMS,"Of battles fought in the cause of right,"
1815,THE DREAMS,And of victories nobly won.
1816,THE DREAMS,
1817,THE DREAMS,It breathed no breath of the dear old home
1818,THE DREAMS,And the quiet joys of youth;
1819,THE DREAMS,It gave no glimpse of the good old friends
1820,THE DREAMS,Or the old-time faith and truth.
1821,THE DREAMS,
1822,THE DREAMS,"But 't was a dream of youthful hopes,"
1823,THE DREAMS,"And fast and free it ran,"
1824,THE DREAMS,And it told to a little sleeping child
1825,THE DREAMS,Of a boy become a man!
1826,THE DREAMS,
1827,THE DREAMS,These were the dreams that came one night
1828,THE DREAMS,To earth from yonder sky;
1829,THE DREAMS,These were the dreams two dreamers dreamed--
1830,THE DREAMS,My little boy and I.
1831,THE DREAMS,
1832,THE DREAMS,And in our hearts my boy and I
1833,THE DREAMS,Were glad that it was so;
1834,THE DREAMS,"_He_ loved to dream of days to come,"
1835,THE DREAMS,And _I_ of long ago.
1836,THE DREAMS,
1837,THE DREAMS,So from our dreams my boy and I
1838,THE DREAMS,"Unwillingly awoke,"
1839,THE DREAMS,But neither of his precious dream
1840,THE DREAMS,Unto the other spoke.
1841,THE DREAMS,
1842,THE DREAMS,Yet of the love we bore those dreams
1843,THE DREAMS,Gave each his tender sign;
1844,THE DREAMS,For there was triumph in _his_ eyes--
1845,THE DREAMS,And there were tears in _mine!_
1846,THE DREAMS,

1850,IN NEW ORLEANS,
1851,IN NEW ORLEANS,'Twas in the Crescent City not long ago befell
1852,IN NEW ORLEANS,The tear-compelling incident I now propose to tell;
1853,IN NEW ORLEANS,"So come, my sweet collector friends, and listen while I sing"
1854,IN NEW ORLEANS,"Unto your delectation this brief, pathetic thing--"
1855,IN NEW ORLEANS,"No lyric pitched in vaunting key, but just a requiem"
1856,IN NEW ORLEANS,Of blowing twenty dollars in by nine o'clock a.m.
1857,IN NEW ORLEANS,
1858,IN NEW ORLEANS,"Let critic folk the poet's use of vulgar slang upbraid,"
1859,IN NEW ORLEANS,"But, when I'm speaking by the card, I call a spade a spade;"
1860,IN NEW ORLEANS,"And I, who have been touched of that same mania, myself,"
1861,IN NEW ORLEANS,"Am well aware that, when it comes to parting with his pelf,"
1862,IN NEW ORLEANS,The curio collector is so blindly lost in sin
1863,IN NEW ORLEANS,That he doesn't spend his money--he simply blows it in!
1864,IN NEW ORLEANS,
1865,IN NEW ORLEANS,"In Royal street (near Conti) there's a lovely curio-shop,"
1866,IN NEW ORLEANS,"And there, one balmy, fateful morn, it was my chance to stop;"
1867,IN NEW ORLEANS,To stop was hesitation--in a moment I was lost--
1868,IN NEW ORLEANS,_That_ kind of hesitation does not hesitate at cost!
1869,IN NEW ORLEANS,"I spied a pewter tankard there, and, my! it was a gem--"
1870,IN NEW ORLEANS,And the clock in old St. Louis told the hour of eight a.m.!
1871,IN NEW ORLEANS,
1872,IN NEW ORLEANS,"Three quaint Bohemian bottles, too, of yellow and of green,"
1873,IN NEW ORLEANS,Cut in archaic fashion that I ne'er before had seen;
1874,IN NEW ORLEANS,"A lovely, hideous platter wreathed about with pink and rose,"
1875,IN NEW ORLEANS,With its curious depression into which the gravy flows;
1876,IN NEW ORLEANS,"Two dainty silver salts--oh, there was no resisting _them_--"
1877,IN NEW ORLEANS,And I'd blown in twenty dollars by nine o'clock a.m.
1878,IN NEW ORLEANS,
1879,IN NEW ORLEANS,"With twenty dollars, one who is a prudent man, indeed,"
1880,IN NEW ORLEANS,Can buy the wealth of useful things his wife and children need;
1881,IN NEW ORLEANS,"Shoes, stockings, knickerbockers, gloves, bibs, nursing-bottles, caps,"
1882,IN NEW ORLEANS,"A gown--_the_ gown for which his spouse too long has pined, perhaps!"
1883,IN NEW ORLEANS,These and ten thousand other spectres harrow and condemn
1884,IN NEW ORLEANS,The man who's blown in twenty by nine o'clock a.m.
1885,IN NEW ORLEANS,
1886,IN NEW ORLEANS,"Oh, mean advantage conscience takes (and one that I abhor!)"
1887,IN NEW ORLEANS,"In asking one this question: ""What _did_ you buy it for?"""
1888,IN NEW ORLEANS,"Why doesn't conscience ply its blessed trade _before_ the act,"
1889,IN NEW ORLEANS,"_Before_ one's cussedness becomes a bald, accomplished fact--"
1890,IN NEW ORLEANS,_Before_ one's fallen victim to the Tempter's stratagem
1891,IN NEW ORLEANS,And blown in twenty dollars by nine o'clock a.m.?
1892,IN NEW ORLEANS,
1893,IN NEW ORLEANS,"Ah me! now that the deed is done, how penitent I am!"
1894,IN NEW ORLEANS,I _was_ a roaring lion--behold a bleating lamb!
1895,IN NEW ORLEANS,I've packed and shipped those precious things to that more precious wife
1896,IN NEW ORLEANS,"Who shares with our sweet babes the strange vicissitudes of life,"
1897,IN NEW ORLEANS,"While he who, in his folly, gave up his store of wealth"

1904,MY PLAYMATES,The wind comes whispering to me of the country green and cool--
1905,MY PLAYMATES,Of redwing blackbirds chattering beside a reedy pool;
1906,MY PLAYMATES,"It brings me soothing fancies of the homestead on the hill,"
1907,MY PLAYMATES,And I hear the thrush's evening song and the robin's morning trill;
1908,MY PLAYMATES,So I fall to thinking tenderly of those I used to know
1909,MY PLAYMATES,Where the sassafras and snakeroot and checkerberries grow.
1910,MY PLAYMATES,

1923,MY PLAYMATES,Who I am sure would answer could they only hear my call!
1924,MY PLAYMATES,
1925,MY PLAYMATES,I'd like to see Bill Warner and the Conkey boys again
1926,MY PLAYMATES,And talk about the times we used to wish that we were men!
1927,MY PLAYMATES,And one--I shall not name her--could I see her gentle face
1928,MY PLAYMATES,"And hear her girlish treble in this distant, lonely place!"
1929,MY PLAYMATES,"The flowers and hopes of springtime--they perished long ago,"
1930,MY PLAYMATES,And the garden where they blossomed is white with winter snow.
1931,MY PLAYMATES,
1932,MY PLAYMATES,"O cottage 'neath the maples, have you seen those girls and boys"
1933,MY PLAYMATES,"That but a little while ago made, oh! such pleasant noise?"
1934,MY PLAYMATES,"O trees, and hills, and brooks, and lanes, and meadows, do you know"
1935,MY PLAYMATES,Where I shall find my little friends of forty years ago?
1936,MY PLAYMATES,"You see I'm old and weary, and I've traveled long and far;"

2153,THE STRAW PARLOR,"He never made use of his horrid old sting,"
2154,THE STRAW PARLOR,But was just upon earth for the fun of the thing!
2155,THE STRAW PARLOR,I deeply regret to observe that so few
2156,THE STRAW PARLOR,"Of these good-natured insects are met with, don't you?"
2157,THE STRAW PARLOR,
2158,THE STRAW PARLOR,"And, down in the strawstack, a wee little mite"
2159,THE STRAW PARLOR,Of a cricket went chirping by day and by night;
2160,THE STRAW PARLOR,"And further down, still, a cunning blue mouse"
2161,THE STRAW PARLOR,In a snug little nook of that strawstack kept house!
2162,THE STRAW PARLOR,"When the cricket went ""chirp,"" Miss Mousie would squeak"
2163,THE STRAW PARLOR,"""Come in,"" and a blush would enkindle her cheek!"
2164,THE STRAW PARLOR,"She thought--silly girl! 't was a beau come to woo,"
2165,THE STRAW PARLOR,"But I guess it was only the cricket, don't you?"
2166,THE STRAW PARLOR,
2167,THE STRAW PARLOR,"So the cricket, the mouse, and the motherly bird"
2168,THE STRAW PARLOR,Made as soothingsome music as ever you heard
2169,THE STRAW PARLOR,"And, meanwhile, that spider by means of his swings"
2170,THE STRAW PARLOR,Achieved most astounding gyrations and things!
2171,THE STRAW PARLOR,No wonder the little folk liked what they saw
2172,THE STRAW PARLOR,And loved what they heard in that parlor of straw!
2173,THE STRAW PARLOR,With the mercury up to 102
2174,THE STRAW PARLOR,"In the shade, I opine they just sizzled, don't you?"
2175,THE STRAW PARLOR,
2176,THE STRAW PARLOR,But once there invaded that Eden of straw
2177,THE STRAW PARLOR,The evilest Feline that ever you saw!
2178,THE STRAW PARLOR,She pounced on that cricket with rare promptitude
2179,THE STRAW PARLOR,And she tucked him away where he'd do the most good;
2180,THE STRAW PARLOR,"And then, reaching down to the nethermost house,"
2181,THE STRAW PARLOR,She deftly expiscated little Miss Mouse!
2182,THE STRAW PARLOR,"And, as for the Swallow, she shrieked and withdrew--"
2183,THE STRAW PARLOR,"I rather admire her discretion, don't you?"
2184,THE STRAW PARLOR,
2185,THE STRAW PARLOR,"Now listen: That evening a cyclone obtained,"
2186,THE STRAW PARLOR,And the mortgage was all on that farm that remained!
2187,THE STRAW PARLOR,"Barn, strawstack and spider--they all blew away,"
2188,THE STRAW PARLOR,And nobody knows where they're at to this day!
2189,THE STRAW PARLOR,"And, as for the little straw parlor, I fear"
2190,THE STRAW PARLOR,It was wafted clean off this sublunary sphere!
2191,THE STRAW PARLOR,"I really incline to a hearty ""boo-hoo"""
2192,THE STRAW PARLOR,"When I think of this tragical ending, don't you?"

2512,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,There were two little skeezucks who lived in the isle
2513,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,Of Boo in a southern sea;
2514,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,They clambered and rollicked in heathenish style
2515,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,In the boughs of their cocoanut tree.
2516,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,They didn't fret much about clothing and such
2517,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,And they recked not a whit of the ills
2518,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,That sometimes accrue
2519,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,From having to do
2520,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,With tailor and laundry bills.
2521,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,
2522,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,The two little skeezucks once heard of a Fair
2523,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"Far off from their native isle,"
2524,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,And they asked of King Fan if they mightn't go there
2525,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,To take in the sights for awhile.
2526,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,Now old King Fan
2527,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,Was a good-natured man
2528,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"(As good-natured monarchs go),"
2529,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"And howbeit he swore that all Fairs were a bore,"
2530,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"He hadn't the heart to say ""No."""
2531,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,
2532,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,So the two little skeezucks sailed off to the Fair
2533,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"In a great big gum canoe,"
2534,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"And I fancy they had a good time there,"
2535,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,For they tarried a year or two.
2536,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,And old King Fan at last began
2537,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"To reckon they'd come to grief,"
2538,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,When glory! one day
2539,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,They sailed into the bay
2540,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"To the tune of ""Hail to the Chief!"""
2541,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,
2542,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"The two little skeezucks fell down on the sand,"
2543,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"Embracing his majesty's toes,"
2544,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,Till his majesty graciously bade them stand
2545,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,And salute him nose to nose.
2546,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,And then quoth he:
2547,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"""Divulge unto me"
2548,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,What happenings have hapt to you;
2549,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,And how did they dare to indulge in a Fair
2550,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"So far from the island of Boo?"""
2551,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,
2552,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,The two little skeezucks assured their king
2553,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,That what he surmised was true;
2554,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,That the Fair would have been a different thing
2555,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,Had it only been held in Boo!
2556,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"""The folk over there in no wise compare"
2557,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,With the folk of the southern seas;
2558,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"Why, they comb out their heads"
2559,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,And they sleep in beds
2560,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"Instead of in caverns and trees!"""
2561,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,
2562,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,The two little skeezucks went on to say
2563,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,That children (so far as they knew)
2564,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,Had a much harder time in that land far away
2565,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,Than here in the island of Boo!
2566,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,They have to wear clo'es
2567,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,Which (as every one knows)
2568,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"Are irksome to primitive laddies,"
2569,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"While, with forks and with spoons, they're denied the sweet boons"
2570,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,That accrue from free use of one's paddies!
2571,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,
2572,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"""And now that you're speaking of things to eat,"""
2573,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"Interrupted the monarch of Boo,"
2574,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"""We beg to inquire if you happened to meet"
2575,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"With a nice missionary or two?"""
2576,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"""No, that we did not; in that curious spot"
2577,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"Where were gathered the fruits of the earth,"
2578,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,Of that special kind
2579,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,Which Your Nibs has in mind
2580,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"There appeared a deplorable dearth!"""
2581,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,
2582,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,Then loud laughed that monarch in heathenish mirth
2583,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"And loud laughed his courtiers, too,"
2584,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"And they cried: ""There is elsewhere no land upon earth"
2585,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"So good as our island of Boo!"""
2586,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"And the skeezucks, tho' glad"
2587,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"Of the journey they'd had,"
2588,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,"Climbed up in their cocoanut trees,"
2589,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,Where they still may be seen with no shirts to keep clean
2590,THE TWO LITTLE SKEEZUCKS,Or trousers that bag at the knees.

2596,PAN LIVETH,"They told me once that Pan was dead,"
2597,PAN LIVETH,"And so, in sooth, I thought him;"
2598,PAN LIVETH,For vainly where the streamlets led
2599,PAN LIVETH,Through flowery meads I sought him--
2600,PAN LIVETH,Nor in his dewy pasture bed
2601,PAN LIVETH,Nor in the grove I caught him.

2606,PAN LIVETH,"A requiem sad and tender,"
2607,PAN LIVETH,"Lo, thither came a shepherd-maid--"
2608,PAN LIVETH,Full comely she and slender!
2609,PAN LIVETH,I were indeed a churlish blade
2610,PAN LIVETH,With wailings to offend 'er--
2611,PAN LIVETH,"_For, surely, wooing's sweeter than"
2612,PAN LIVETH,A mourning over Pan!_
2613,PAN LIVETH,
2614,PAN LIVETH,"So, presently, whiles I did scan"
2615,PAN LIVETH,"That shepherd-maiden pretty,"
2616,PAN LIVETH,"And heard her accents, I began"
2617,PAN LIVETH,To pipe a cheerful ditty;
2618,PAN LIVETH,"And so, betimes, forgot old Pan"
2619,PAN LIVETH,Whose death had waked my pity;
2620,PAN LIVETH,_So--so did Love undo the man
2621,PAN LIVETH,Who sought and pined for Pan!_
2622,PAN LIVETH,
2623,PAN LIVETH,He was _not_ dead! I found him there--
2624,PAN LIVETH,The Pan that I was after!
2625,PAN LIVETH,"Caught in that maiden's tangling hair,"
2626,PAN LIVETH,Drunk with her song and laughter!
2627,PAN LIVETH,I doubt if there be otherwhere
2628,PAN LIVETH,A merrier god or dafter--
2629,PAN LIVETH,"_Nay, nor a mortal kindlier than"
2630,PAN LIVETH,Is this same dear old Pan!_
2631,PAN LIVETH,
2632,PAN LIVETH,"Beside me, as my pipe I play,"
2633,PAN LIVETH,"My shepherdess is lying,"
2634,PAN LIVETH,While here and there her lambkins stray
2635,PAN LIVETH,As sunny hours go flying;
2636,PAN LIVETH,"They look like me--those lambs--they say,"
2637,PAN LIVETH,And that I'm not denying!
2638,PAN LIVETH,"_And for that sturdy, romping clan,"
2639,PAN LIVETH,All glory be to Pan!_
2640,PAN LIVETH,
2641,PAN LIVETH,"Pan is not dead, O sweetheart mine!"
2642,PAN LIVETH,It is to hear his voices
2643,PAN LIVETH,In every note and every line
2644,PAN LIVETH,Wherein the heart rejoices!
2645,PAN LIVETH,He liveth in that sacred shrine
2646,PAN LIVETH,"That Love's first, holiest choice is!"
2647,PAN LIVETH,"_So pipe, my pipe, while still you can,"
2648,PAN LIVETH,Sweet songs in praise of Pan!_

2884,THE PETER-BIRD,"Serpents and caw-caws and bats, screech-owls and crickets and adders--"
2885,THE PETER-BIRD,These were the guides of that witch through the dank deeps of the forest.
2886,THE PETER-BIRD,"Then, with her roots and her herbs, back to her cave in the morning"
2887,THE PETER-BIRD,Ambled that hussy to brew spells of unspeakable evil;
2888,THE PETER-BIRD,"And, when the people awoke, seeing that hillside and valley"
2889,THE PETER-BIRD,"Sweltered in swathes as of mist--""Look!"" they would whisper in terror--"
2890,THE PETER-BIRD,"""Look! the old witch is at work brewing her spells of great evil!"""
2891,THE PETER-BIRD,"Then would they pray till the sun, darting his rays through the vapor,"
2892,THE PETER-BIRD,Lifted the smoke from the earth and baffled the witch's intentions.
2893,THE PETER-BIRD,
2894,THE PETER-BIRD,"One of the boys at that time was a certain young person named Peter,"
2895,THE PETER-BIRD,"Given too little to work, given too largely to dreaming;"
2896,THE PETER-BIRD,"Fonder of books than of chores, you can imagine that Peter"
2897,THE PETER-BIRD,"Led a sad life on the farm, causing his parents much trouble."
2898,THE PETER-BIRD,"""Peter!"" his mother would call, ""the cream is a'ready for churning!"""
2899,THE PETER-BIRD,"""Peter!"" his father would cry, ""go grub at the weeds in the garden!"""
2900,THE PETER-BIRD,"So it was ""Peter!"" all day--calling, reminding, and chiding--"
2901,THE PETER-BIRD,Peter neglected his work; therefore that nagging at Peter!
2902,THE PETER-BIRD,
2903,THE PETER-BIRD,"Peter got hold of some books--how, I'm unable to tell you;"
2904,THE PETER-BIRD,Some have suspected the witch--this is no place for suspicions!
2905,THE PETER-BIRD,It is sufficient to stick close to the thread of the legend.
2906,THE PETER-BIRD,Nor is it stated or guessed what was the trend of those volumes;
2907,THE PETER-BIRD,"What thing soever it was--done with a pen and a pencil,"
2908,THE PETER-BIRD,"Wrought with a brain, not a hoe--surely 't was hostile to farming!"
2909,THE PETER-BIRD,
2910,THE PETER-BIRD,"""Fudge on all readin'!"" they quoth; or ""_that's_ what's the ruin of"
2911,THE PETER-BIRD,"Peter!"""
2912,THE PETER-BIRD,
2913,THE PETER-BIRD,"So, when the mornings were hot, under the beech or the maple,"
2914,THE PETER-BIRD,"Cushioned in grass that was blue, breathing the breath of the blossoms,"
2915,THE PETER-BIRD,"Lulled by the hum of the bees, the coo of the ring-doves a-mating,"
2916,THE PETER-BIRD,"Peter would frivol his time at reading, or lazing, or dreaming."
2917,THE PETER-BIRD,"""Peter!"" his mother would call, ""the cream is a'ready for churning!"""
2918,THE PETER-BIRD,"""Peter!"" his father would cry, ""go grub at the weeds in the garden!"""
2919,THE PETER-BIRD,"""Peter!"" and ""Peter!"" all day--calling, reminding, and chiding--"
2920,THE PETER-BIRD,Peter neglected his chores; therefore that outcry for Peter;
2921,THE PETER-BIRD,Therefore the neighbors allowed evil would surely befall him--
2922,THE PETER-BIRD,"Yes, on account of these things, ruin would come upon Peter!"
2923,THE PETER-BIRD,
2924,THE PETER-BIRD,"Surely enough, on a time, reading and lazing and dreaming"
2925,THE PETER-BIRD,Wrought the calamitous ill all had predicted for Peter;
2926,THE PETER-BIRD,"For, of a morning in spring when lay the mist in the valleys--"
2927,THE PETER-BIRD,"""See,"" quoth the folk, ""how the witch breweth her evil decoctions!"
2928,THE PETER-BIRD,See how the smoke from her fire broodeth on woodland and meadow!
2929,THE PETER-BIRD,Grant that the sun cometh out to smother the smudge of her caldron!
2930,THE PETER-BIRD,"She hath been forth in the night, full of her spells and devices,"
2931,THE PETER-BIRD,Roaming the marshes and dells for heathenish magical nostrums;
2932,THE PETER-BIRD,"Digging in leaves and at stumps for centipedes, pismires, and spiders,"
2933,THE PETER-BIRD,Grubbing in poisonous pools for hot salamanders and toadstools;
2934,THE PETER-BIRD,"Charming the bats from the flues, snaring the lizards by twilight,"
2935,THE PETER-BIRD,"Sucking the scorpion's egg and milking the breast of the adder!"""
2936,THE PETER-BIRD,
2937,THE PETER-BIRD,"Peter derided these things held in such faith by the farmer,"
2938,THE PETER-BIRD,"Scouted at magic and charms, hooted at Jonahs and hoodoos--"
2939,THE PETER-BIRD,Thinking and reading of books must have unsettled his reason!
2940,THE PETER-BIRD,"""There ain't no witches,"" he cried; ""it isn't smoky, but foggy!"
2941,THE PETER-BIRD,"I will go out in the wet--you all can't hender me, nuther!"""
2942,THE PETER-BIRD,
2943,THE PETER-BIRD,"Surely enough he went out into the damp of the morning,"
2944,THE PETER-BIRD,"Into the smudge that the witch spread over woodland and meadow,"
2945,THE PETER-BIRD,Into the fleecy gray pall brooding on hillside and valley.
2946,THE PETER-BIRD,"Laughing and scoffing, he strode into that hideous vapor;"
2947,THE PETER-BIRD,"Just as he said he would do, just as he bantered and threatened,"
2948,THE PETER-BIRD,"Ere they could fasten the door, Peter had done gone and done it!"
2949,THE PETER-BIRD,"Wasting his time over books, you see, had unsettled his reason--"
2950,THE PETER-BIRD,"Soddened his callow young brain with semi-pubescent paresis,"
2951,THE PETER-BIRD,And his neglect of his chores hastened this evil condition.
2952,THE PETER-BIRD,
2953,THE PETER-BIRD,Out of the woods by the creek cometh a calling for Peter
2954,THE PETER-BIRD,And from the orchard a voice echoes and echoes it over;
2955,THE PETER-BIRD,"Down in the pasture the sheep hear that shrill crying for Peter,"
2956,THE PETER-BIRD,"Up from the spring house the wail stealeth anon like a whisper,"
2957,THE PETER-BIRD,Over the meadows that call is aye and forever repeated.
2958,THE PETER-BIRD,Such were the voices that whooped wildly and vainly for Peter
2959,THE PETER-BIRD,Decades and decades ago down in the State of Kentucky--
2960,THE PETER-BIRD,"Such _are_ the voices that cry now from the woodland and meadow,"
2961,THE PETER-BIRD,"""Peter--O Peter!"" all day, calling, reminding, and chiding--"
2962,THE PETER-BIRD,Taking us back to the time when Peter he done gone and done it!
2963,THE PETER-BIRD,These are the voices of those left by the boy in the farmhouse
2964,THE PETER-BIRD,"When, with his laughter and scorn, hatless and bootless and sockless,"
2965,THE PETER-BIRD,"Clothed in his jeans and his pride, Peter sailed out in the weather,"
2966,THE PETER-BIRD,"Broke from the warmth of his home into that fog of the devil,"
2967,THE PETER-BIRD,Into the smoke of that witch brewing her damnable porridge!
2968,THE PETER-BIRD,
2969,THE PETER-BIRD,"Lo, when he vanished from sight, knowing the evil that threatened,"
2970,THE PETER-BIRD,Forth with importunate cries hastened his father and mother.
2971,THE PETER-BIRD,"""Peter!"" they shrieked in alarm, ""Peter!"" and evermore ""Peter!""--"
2972,THE PETER-BIRD,"Ran from the house to the barn, ran from the barn to the garden,"
2973,THE PETER-BIRD,"Ran to the corn-crib anon, then to the smoke-house proceeded;"
2974,THE PETER-BIRD,"Henhouse and woodpile they passed, calling and wailing and weeping,"
2975,THE PETER-BIRD,"Through the front gate to the road, braving the hideous vapor--"
2976,THE PETER-BIRD,"Sought him in lane and on pike, called him in orchard and meadow,"
2977,THE PETER-BIRD,"Clamoring ""Peter!"" in vain, vainly outcrying for Peter."
2978,THE PETER-BIRD,"Joining the search came the rest, brothers and sisters and cousins,"
2979,THE PETER-BIRD,Venting unspeakable fears in pitiful wailing for Peter!
2980,THE PETER-BIRD,"And from the neighboring farms gathered the men and the women,"
2981,THE PETER-BIRD,"Who, upon hearing the news, swelled the loud chorus for Peter."
2982,THE PETER-BIRD,
2983,THE PETER-BIRD,"Farmers and hussifs and maids, bosses and field-hands and niggers,"
2984,THE PETER-BIRD,"Colonels and jedges galore from cornfields and mint-beds and thickets,"
2985,THE PETER-BIRD,"All that had voices to voice, all to those parts appertaining,"
2986,THE PETER-BIRD,"Came to engage in the search, gathered and bellowed for Peter."
2987,THE PETER-BIRD,"The Taylors, the Dorseys, the Browns, the Wallers, the Mitchells, the"
2988,THE PETER-BIRD,"Logans,"
2989,THE PETER-BIRD,"The Yenowines, Crittendens, Dukes, the Hickmans, the Hobbses, the Morgans;"

2994,THE PETER-BIRD,Slaughters--
2995,THE PETER-BIRD,"All, famed in Kentucky of old for prowess prodigious at farming,"
2996,THE PETER-BIRD,Now surged from their prosperous homes to join in that hunt for the
2997,THE PETER-BIRD,"truant,"
2998,THE PETER-BIRD,"To ascertain where he was at, to help out the chorus for Peter."
2999,THE PETER-BIRD,
3000,THE PETER-BIRD,Still on those prosperous farms where heirs and assigns of the people
3001,THE PETER-BIRD,Specified hereinabove and proved by the records of probate--
3002,THE PETER-BIRD,_Still_ on those farms shall you hear (and still on the turnpikes
3003,THE PETER-BIRD,adjacent)
3004,THE PETER-BIRD,"That pitiful, petulant call, that pleading, expostulant wailing,"
3005,THE PETER-BIRD,"That hopeless, monotonous moan, that crooning and droning for Peter."
3006,THE PETER-BIRD,Some say the witch in her wrath transmogrified all those good people;
3007,THE PETER-BIRD,"That, wakened from slumber that day by the calling and bawling for Peter,"
3008,THE PETER-BIRD,"She out of her cave in a thrice, and, waving the foot of a rabbit"
3009,THE PETER-BIRD,"(Crossed with the caul of a coon and smeared with the blood of a chicken),"
3010,THE PETER-BIRD,She changed all those folk into birds and shrieked with demoniac venom:
3011,THE PETER-BIRD,"""Fly away over the land, moaning your Peter forever,"
3012,THE PETER-BIRD,"Croaking of Peter, the boy who didn't believe there were hoodoos,"
3013,THE PETER-BIRD,"Crooning of Peter, the fool who scouted at stories of witches,"
3014,THE PETER-BIRD,"Crying of Peter for aye, forever outcalling for Peter!"""
3015,THE PETER-BIRD,
3016,THE PETER-BIRD,This is the story they tell; so in good sooth saith the legend;
3017,THE PETER-BIRD,"As I have told it to you, so tell the folk and the legend."
3018,THE PETER-BIRD,"That it is true I believe, for on the breezes this morning"
3019,THE PETER-BIRD,Come the shrill voices of birds calling and calling for Peter;
3020,THE PETER-BIRD,"Out of the maple and beech glitter the eyes of the wailers,"
3021,THE PETER-BIRD,Peeping and peering for him who formerly lived in these places--
3022,THE PETER-BIRD,"Peter, the heretic lad, lazy and careless and dreaming,"
3023,THE PETER-BIRD,"Sorely afflicted with books and with pubescent paresis,"
3024,THE PETER-BIRD,"Hating the things of the farm, care of the barn and the garden,"
3025,THE PETER-BIRD,"Always neglecting his chores--given to books and to reading,"
3026,THE PETER-BIRD,"Which, as all people allow, turn the young person to mischief,"
3027,THE PETER-BIRD,"Harden his heart against toil, wean his affections from tillage."
3028,THE PETER-BIRD,
3029,THE PETER-BIRD,This is the legend of yore told in the state of Kentucky
3030,THE PETER-BIRD,"When in the springtime the birds call from the beeches and maples,"
3031,THE PETER-BIRD,"Call from the petulant thorn, call from the acrid persimmon;"
3032,THE PETER-BIRD,"When from the woods by the creek and from the pastures and meadows,"
3033,THE PETER-BIRD,"When from the spring house and lane and from the mint-bed and orchard,"
3034,THE PETER-BIRD,"When from the redbud and gum and from the redolent lilac,"
3035,THE PETER-BIRD,When from the dirt roads and pikes cometh that calling for Peter;
3036,THE PETER-BIRD,"Cometh the dolorous cry, cometh that weird iteration"
3037,THE PETER-BIRD,"Of ""Peter"" and ""Peter"" for aye, of ""Peter"" and ""Peter"" forever!"
3038,THE PETER-BIRD,"This is the legend of old, told in the tum-titty meter"
3039,THE PETER-BIRD,"Which the great poets prefer, being less labor than rhyming"
3040,THE PETER-BIRD,"(My first attempt at the same, my _last_ attempt, too, I reckon!);"

3047,SISTER'S CAKE,"I'd not complain of Sister Jane, for she was good and kind,"
3048,SISTER'S CAKE,Combining with rare comeliness distinctive gifts of mind;
3049,SISTER'S CAKE,"Nay, I'll admit it were most fit that, worn by social cares,"
3050,SISTER'S CAKE,"She'd crave a change from parlor life to that below the stairs,"
3051,SISTER'S CAKE,"And that, eschewing needlework and music, she should take"
3052,SISTER'S CAKE,Herself to the substantial art of manufacturing cake.
3053,SISTER'S CAKE,
3054,SISTER'S CAKE,"At breakfast, then, it would befall that Sister Jane would say:"
3055,SISTER'S CAKE,"""Mother, if you have got the things, I'll make some cake to-day!"""
3056,SISTER'S CAKE,"Poor mother'd cast a timid glance at father, like as not--"
3057,SISTER'S CAKE,For father hinted sister's cooking cost a frightful lot--
3058,SISTER'S CAKE,"But neither _she_ nor _he_ presumed to signify dissent,"
3059,SISTER'S CAKE,Accepting it for gospel truth that what she wanted went!
3060,SISTER'S CAKE,
3061,SISTER'S CAKE,"No matter what the rest of 'em might chance to have in hand,"
3062,SISTER'S CAKE,The whole machinery of the house came to a sudden stand;
3063,SISTER'S CAKE,"The pots were hustled off the stove, the fire built up anew,"
3064,SISTER'S CAKE,With every damper set just so to heat the oven through;
3065,SISTER'S CAKE,"The kitchen-table was relieved of everything, to make"
3066,SISTER'S CAKE,That ample space which Jane required when she compounded cake.
3067,SISTER'S CAKE,
3068,SISTER'S CAKE,"And, oh! the bustling here and there, the flying to and fro;"
3069,SISTER'S CAKE,The click of forks that whipped the eggs to lather white as snow--
3070,SISTER'S CAKE,And what a wealth of sugar melted swiftly out of sight--
3071,SISTER'S CAKE,"And butter? Mother said such waste would ruin father, quite!"
3072,SISTER'S CAKE,But Sister Jane preserved a mien no pleading could confound
3073,SISTER'S CAKE,As she utilized the raisins and the citron by the pound.
3074,SISTER'S CAKE,
3075,SISTER'S CAKE,"Oh, hours of chaos, tumult, heat, vexatious din, and whirl!"
3076,SISTER'S CAKE,Of deep humiliation for the sullen hired-girl;
3077,SISTER'S CAKE,"Of grief for mother, hating to see things wasted so,"
3078,SISTER'S CAKE,And of fortune for that little boy who pined to taste that dough!
3079,SISTER'S CAKE,"It looked so sweet and yellow--sure, to taste it were no sin--"
3080,SISTER'S CAKE,"But, oh! how sister scolded if he stuck his finger in!"
3081,SISTER'S CAKE,
3082,SISTER'S CAKE,"The chances were as ten to one, before the job was through,"
3083,SISTER'S CAKE,That sister'd think of something else she'd great deal rather do!
3084,SISTER'S CAKE,"So, then, she'd softly steal away, as Arabs in the night,"
3085,SISTER'S CAKE,Leaving the girl and ma to finish up as best they might;
3086,SISTER'S CAKE,These tactics (artful Sister Jane) enabled her to take
3087,SISTER'S CAKE,Or shift the credit or the blame of that too-treacherous cake!
3088,SISTER'S CAKE,
3089,SISTER'S CAKE,"And yet, unhappy is the man who has no Sister Jane--"
3090,SISTER'S CAKE,For he who has no sister seems to me to live in vain.
3091,SISTER'S CAKE,I never had a sister--may be that is why today
3092,SISTER'S CAKE,"I'm wizened and dyspeptic, instead of blithe and gay;"
3093,SISTER'S CAKE,"A boy who's only forty should be full of romp and mirth,"
3094,SISTER'S CAKE,But _I _(because I'm sisterless) am the oldest man on earth!
3095,SISTER'S CAKE,
3096,SISTER'S CAKE,"Had I a little sister--oh, how happy I should be!"
3097,SISTER'S CAKE,I'd never let her cast her eyes on any chap but me;
3098,SISTER'S CAKE,I'd love her and I'd cherish her for better and for worse--
3099,SISTER'S CAKE,"I'd buy her gowns and bonnets, and sing her praise in verse;"
3100,SISTER'S CAKE,"And--yes, what's more and vastly more--I tell you what I'd do:"
3101,SISTER'S CAKE,"I'd let her make her wondrous cake, and I would eat it, too!"
3102,SISTER'S CAKE,
3103,SISTER'S CAKE,"I have a high opinion of the sisters, as you see--"
3104,SISTER'S CAKE,Another fellow's sister is so very dear to me!
3105,SISTER'S CAKE,"I love to work anear her when she's making over frocks,"
3106,SISTER'S CAKE,When she patches little trousers or darns prosaic socks;
3107,SISTER'S CAKE,"But I draw the line at one thing--yes, I don my hat and take"
3108,SISTER'S CAKE,A three hours' walk when she is moved to try her hand at cake!

3263,NEW-YEAR'S EVE,"When the things of earth seemed full of life,"

3269,NEW-YEAR'S EVE,"But a voice--a spectre's, that mocked at love--"
3270,NEW-YEAR'S EVE,Came out of the yonder hall;

3452,FITTE THE FIRST,The pup was of as noble mien
3453,FITTE THE FIRST,As e'er you gazed upon;
3454,FITTE THE FIRST,They called his mother Lady
3455,FITTE THE FIRST,And his father was a Don.
3456,FITTE THE FIRST,
3457,FITTE THE FIRST,And both his mother and his sire
3458,FITTE THE FIRST,Were of the race Bernard--
3459,FITTE THE FIRST,The family famed in histories
3460,FITTE THE FIRST,And hymned of every bard.
3461,FITTE THE FIRST,
3462,FITTE THE FIRST,"His form was of exuberant mold,"
3463,FITTE THE FIRST,"Long, slim, and loose of joints;"

3466,FITTE THE FIRST,
3467,FITTE THE FIRST,"His hair was like to yellow fleece,"
3468,FITTE THE FIRST,"His eyes were black and kind,"
3469,FITTE THE FIRST,"And like a nodding, gilded plume"
3470,FITTE THE FIRST,His tail stuck up behind.
3471,FITTE THE FIRST,
3472,FITTE THE FIRST,"His bark was very, very fierce,"
3473,FITTE THE FIRST,"And fierce his appetite,"
3474,FITTE THE FIRST,Yet was it only things to eat
3475,FITTE THE FIRST,That he was prone to bite.
3476,FITTE THE FIRST,
3477,FITTE THE FIRST,But in that one particular
3478,FITTE THE FIRST,He was so passing true

3481,FITTE THE FIRST,
3482,FITTE THE FIRST,"Potatoes, biscuits, mush or hash,"

3491,FITTE THE FIRST,
3492,FITTE THE FIRST,So was he much beholden of

3494,FITTE THE FIRST,They loved him when he was awake

3520,FITTE THE SECOND,"""Take any soap, but take the pup"

3522,FITTE THE SECOND,And mix the three discreetly up
3523,FITTE THE SECOND,Till they a lather make.

3525,FITTE THE SECOND,"""Then mixing these constituent parts,"
3526,FITTE THE SECOND,"Let Nature take her way,"""
3527,FITTE THE SECOND,With which advice that sapient sir
3528,FITTE THE SECOND,Had nothing more to say.
3529,FITTE THE SECOND,
3530,FITTE THE SECOND,Then fared he to his daily toil
3531,FITTE THE SECOND,"All in the Board of Trade,"
3532,FITTE THE SECOND,While Mistress Taylor for that bath
3533,FITTE THE SECOND,Due preparation made.

3536,FITTE THE THIRD,FITTE THE THIRD
3537,FITTE THE THIRD,
3538,FITTE THE THIRD,She whistled gayly to the pup
3539,FITTE THE THIRD,"And called him by his name,"
3540,FITTE THE THIRD,And presently the guileless thing
3541,FITTE THE THIRD,All unsuspecting came.
3542,FITTE THE THIRD,
3543,FITTE THE THIRD,"But when she shut the bath-room door,"
3544,FITTE THE THIRD,"And caught him as catch-can,"
3545,FITTE THE THIRD,"And hove him in that odious tub,"
3546,FITTE THE THIRD,His sorrows then began.
3547,FITTE THE THIRD,
3548,FITTE THE THIRD,"How did that callow, yallow thing"
3549,FITTE THE THIRD,Regret that Aprile morn--
3550,FITTE THE THIRD,Alas! how bitterly he rued
3551,FITTE THE THIRD,The day that he was born!
3552,FITTE THE THIRD,
3553,FITTE THE THIRD,"Twice and again, but all in vain"
3554,FITTE THE THIRD,He lifted up his wail;
3555,FITTE THE THIRD,"His voice was all the pup could lift,"
3556,FITTE THE THIRD,For thereby hangs this tale.
3557,FITTE THE THIRD,
3558,FITTE THE THIRD,"'Twas by that tail she held him down,"
3559,FITTE THE THIRD,And presently she spread
3560,FITTE THE THIRD,"The creamy lather on his back,"
3561,FITTE THE THIRD,"His stomach, and his head."
3562,FITTE THE THIRD,
3563,FITTE THE THIRD,"His ears hung down in sorry wise,"
3564,FITTE THE THIRD,"His eyes were, oh! so sad--"
3565,FITTE THE THIRD,He looked as though he just had lost
3566,FITTE THE THIRD,The only friend he had.
3567,FITTE THE THIRD,
3568,FITTE THE THIRD,"And higher yet the water rose,"
3569,FITTE THE THIRD,"The lather still increased,"
3570,FITTE THE THIRD,And sadder still the countenance
3571,FITTE THE THIRD,Of that poor martyred beast!
3572,FITTE THE THIRD,
3573,FITTE THE THIRD,Yet all the time his mistress spoke
3574,FITTE THE THIRD,Such artful words of cheer
3575,FITTE THE THIRD,"As ""Oh, how nice!"" and ""Oh, how clean!"""
3576,FITTE THE THIRD,"And ""There's a patient dear!"""
3577,FITTE THE THIRD,
3578,FITTE THE THIRD,"At last the trial had an end,"
3579,FITTE THE THIRD,At last the pup was free;
3580,FITTE THE THIRD,She threw aside the bath-room door--
3581,FITTE THE THIRD,"""Now get you gone!"" quoth she."

3583,FITTE THE THIRD,
3584,FITTE THE FOURTH,FITTE THE FOURTH
3585,FITTE THE FOURTH,
3586,FITTE THE FOURTH,Then from that tub and from that room
3587,FITTE THE FOURTH,He gat with vast ado;
3588,FITTE THE FOURTH,"At every hop he gave a shake,"
3589,FITTE THE FOURTH,And--how the water flew!
3590,FITTE THE FOURTH,
3591,FITTE THE FOURTH,He paddled down the winding stairs
3592,FITTE THE FOURTH,"And to the parlor hied,"
3593,FITTE THE FOURTH,Dispensing pools of foamy suds
3594,FITTE THE FOURTH,And slop on every side.
3595,FITTE THE FOURTH,
3596,FITTE THE FOURTH,Upon the carpet then he rolled
3597,FITTE THE FOURTH,"And brushed against the wall,"
3598,FITTE THE FOURTH,"And, horror! whisked his lathery sides"
3599,FITTE THE FOURTH,On overcoat and shawl.
3600,FITTE THE FOURTH,
3601,FITTE THE FOURTH,"Attracted by the dreadful din,"
3602,FITTE THE FOURTH,His mistress came below--
3603,FITTE THE FOURTH,"Who, who can speak her wonderment--"
3604,FITTE THE FOURTH,"Who, who can paint her woe!"
3605,FITTE THE FOURTH,
3606,FITTE THE FOURTH,Great smears of soap were here and there--
3607,FITTE THE FOURTH,Her startled vision met
3608,FITTE THE FOURTH,"With blobs of lather everywhere,"
3609,FITTE THE FOURTH,And everything was wet!
3610,FITTE THE FOURTH,
3611,FITTE THE FOURTH,Then Mrs. Taylor gave a shriek
3612,FITTE THE FOURTH,Like one about to die:
3613,FITTE THE FOURTH,"""Get out--get out, and don't you dare"
3614,FITTE THE FOURTH,"Come in till you are dry!"""
3615,FITTE THE FOURTH,
3616,FITTE THE FOURTH,With that she opened wide the door
3617,FITTE THE FOURTH,And waved the critter through;
3618,FITTE THE FOURTH,Out in the circumambient air
3619,FITTE THE FOURTH,With grateful yelps he flew.
3620,FITTE THE FOURTH,
3621,FITTE THE FOURTH,
3622,FITTE THE FIFTH,FITTE THE FIFTH
3623,FITTE THE FIFTH,
3624,FITTE THE FIFTH,He whisked into the dusty street
3625,FITTE THE FIFTH,"And to the Waller lot,"
3626,FITTE THE FIFTH,Where bonnie Annie Evans played
3627,FITTE THE FIFTH,With charming Sissy Knott.
3628,FITTE THE FIFTH,
3629,FITTE THE FIFTH,And with those pretty little dears
3630,FITTE THE FIFTH,He mixed himself all up--
3631,FITTE THE FIFTH,"Oh, fie upon such boisterous play--"

3997,THE SLEEPING CHILD,"My baby slept--how calm his rest,"
3998,THE SLEEPING CHILD,As o'er his handsome face a smile
3999,THE SLEEPING CHILD,"Like that of angel flitted, while"
4000,THE SLEEPING CHILD,He lay so still upon my breast!
4001,THE SLEEPING CHILD,
4002,THE SLEEPING CHILD,My baby slept--his baby head
4003,THE SLEEPING CHILD,Lay all unkiss'd 'neath pall and shroud:
4004,THE SLEEPING CHILD,I did not weep or cry aloud--
4005,THE SLEEPING CHILD,"I only wished I, too, were dead!"
4006,THE SLEEPING CHILD,
4007,THE SLEEPING CHILD,"My baby sleeps--a tiny mound,"
4008,THE SLEEPING CHILD,"All covered by the little flowers,"
4009,THE SLEEPING CHILD,"Woos me in all my waking hours,"
4010,THE SLEEPING CHILD,Down in the quiet burying-ground.
4011,THE SLEEPING CHILD,
4012,THE SLEEPING CHILD,And when I sleep I seem to be
4013,THE SLEEPING CHILD,With baby in another land--
4014,THE SLEEPING CHILD,I take his little baby hand--
4015,THE SLEEPING CHILD,He smiles and sings sweet songs to me.
4016,THE SLEEPING CHILD,
4017,THE SLEEPING CHILD,"Sleep on, O baby, while I keep"
4018,THE SLEEPING CHILD,My vigils till this day be passed!
4019,THE SLEEPING CHILD,"Then shall I, too, lie down at last,"
4020,THE SLEEPING CHILD,And with my baby darling sleep.

4029,THE TWO COFFINS,And a singer sleeps hard by.
4030,THE TWO COFFINS,
4031,THE TWO COFFINS,Once had that King great power
4032,THE TWO COFFINS,And proudly ruled the land--
4033,THE TWO COFFINS,His crown e'en now is on his brow
4034,THE TWO COFFINS,And his sword is in his hand.
4035,THE TWO COFFINS,
4036,THE TWO COFFINS,How sweetly sleeps the singer
4037,THE TWO COFFINS,"With calmly folded eyes,"
4038,THE TWO COFFINS,And on the breast of the bard at rest
4039,THE TWO COFFINS,The harp that he sounded lies.
4040,THE TWO COFFINS,
4041,THE TWO COFFINS,The castle walls are falling
4042,THE TWO COFFINS,"And war distracts the land,"
4043,THE TWO COFFINS,But the sword leaps not from that mildewed spot
4044,THE TWO COFFINS,There in that dead king's hand.
4045,THE TWO COFFINS,
4046,THE TWO COFFINS,But with every grace of nature
4047,THE TWO COFFINS,There seems to float along--
4048,THE TWO COFFINS,To cheer again the hearts of men
4049,THE TWO COFFINS,The singer's deathless song.

4054,CLARE MARKET,
4055,CLARE MARKET,"In the market of Clare, so cheery the glare"
4056,CLARE MARKET,Of the shops and the booths of the tradespeople there;
4057,CLARE MARKET,That I take a delight on a Saturday night
4058,CLARE MARKET,In walking that way and in viewing the sight.
4059,CLARE MARKET,For it's here that one sees all the objects that please--
4060,CLARE MARKET,"New patterns in silk and old patterns in cheese,"
4061,CLARE MARKET,"For the girls pretty toys, rude alarums for boys,"
4062,CLARE MARKET,And baubles galore while discretion enjoys--
4063,CLARE MARKET,"But here I forbear, for I really despair"
4064,CLARE MARKET,Of naming the wealth of the market of Clare.
4065,CLARE MARKET,
4066,CLARE MARKET,A rich man comes down from the elegant town
4067,CLARE MARKET,And looks at it all with an ominous frown;
4068,CLARE MARKET,He seems to despise the grandiloquent cries
4069,CLARE MARKET,Of the vender proclaiming his puddings and pies;
4070,CLARE MARKET,And sniffing he goes through the lanes that disclose
4071,CLARE MARKET,Much cause for disgust to his sensitive nose;
4072,CLARE MARKET,"And free of the crowd, he admits he is proud"
4073,CLARE MARKET,That elsewhere in London this thing's not allowed;
4074,CLARE MARKET,"He has seen nothing there but filth everywhere,"
4075,CLARE MARKET,And he's glad to get out of the market of Clare.
4076,CLARE MARKET,
4077,CLARE MARKET,But the child that has come from the gloom of the slum
4078,CLARE MARKET,Is charmed by the magic of dazzle and hum;
4079,CLARE MARKET,"He feasts his big eyes on the cakes and the pies,"
4080,CLARE MARKET,And they seem to grow green and protrude with surprise
4081,CLARE MARKET,At the goodies they vend and the toys without end--
4082,CLARE MARKET,And it's oh! if he had but a penny to spend!
4083,CLARE MARKET,"But alas, he must gaze in a hopeless amaze"
4084,CLARE MARKET,At treasures that glitter and torches that blaze--
4085,CLARE MARKET,What sense of despair in this world can compare
4086,CLARE MARKET,With that of the waif in the market of Clare?
4087,CLARE MARKET,
4088,CLARE MARKET,"So, on Saturday night, when my custom invites"
4089,CLARE MARKET,"A stroll in old London for curious sights,"
4090,CLARE MARKET,I am likely to stray by a devious way
4091,CLARE MARKET,"Where goodies are spread in a motley array,"
4092,CLARE MARKET,The things which some eyes would appear to despise
4093,CLARE MARKET,"Impress me as pathos in homely disguise,"
4094,CLARE MARKET,"And my battered waif-friend shall have pennies to spend,"
4095,CLARE MARKET,So long as I've got 'em (or chums that will lend);
4096,CLARE MARKET,And the urchin shall share in my joy and declare
4097,CLARE MARKET,That there's beauty and good in the market of Clare.

4100,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE
4101,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,
4102,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,I'm weary of this weather and I hanker for the ways
4103,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,Which people read of in the psalms and preachers paraphrase--
4104,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"The grassy fields, the leafy woods, the banks where I can lie"
4105,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"And listen to the music of the brook that flutters by,"
4106,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"Or, by the pond out yonder, hear the redwing blackbird's call"
4107,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"Where he makes believe he has a nest, but hasn't one at all;"
4108,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"And by my side should be a friend--a trusty, genial friend,"
4109,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,With plenteous store of tales galore and natural leaf to lend;
4110,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"Oh, how I pine and hanker for the gracious boon of spring--"
4111,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,For _then_ I'm going a-fishing with John Lyle King!
4112,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,
4113,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"How like to pigmies will appear creation, as we float"
4114,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,Upon the bosom of the tide in a three-by-thirteen boat--
4115,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"Forgotten all vexations and all vanities shall be,"
4116,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,As we cast our cares to windward and our anchor to the lee;
4117,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"Anon the minnow-bucket will emit batrachian sobs,"
4118,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,And the devil's darning-needles shall come wooing of our bobs;
4119,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,The sun shall kiss our noses and the breezes toss our hair
4120,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,(This latter metaphoric--we've no fimbriae to spare!);
4121,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,And I--transported by the bliss--shan't do a plaguey thing
4122,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,But cut the bait and string the fish for John Lyle King!
4123,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,
4124,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"Or, if I angle, it will be for bullheads and the like,"
4125,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"While he shall fish for gamey bass, for pickerel, and for pike;"
4126,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,I really do not care a rap for all the fish that swim--
4127,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,But it's worth the wealth of Indies just to be along with him
4128,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"In grassy fields, in leafy woods, beside the water-brooks,"
4129,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,And hear him tell of things he's seen or read of in his books--
4130,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,To hear the sweet philosophy that trickles in and out
4131,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,The while he is discoursing of the things we talk about;
4132,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"A fountain-head refreshing--a clear, perennial spring"
4133,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,Is the genial conversation of John Lyle King!
4134,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,
4135,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,Should varying winds or shifting tides redound to our despite--
4136,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"In other words, should we return all bootless home at night,"
4137,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,I'd back him up in anything he had a mind to say
4138,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,Of mighty bass he'd left behind or lost upon the way;
4139,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,I'd nod assent to every yarn involving piscine game--
4140,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,I'd cross my heart and make my affidavit to the same;
4141,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,For what is friendship but a scheme to help a fellow out--
4142,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,And what a paltry fish or two to make such bones about!
4143,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"Nay, Sentiment a mantle of sweet charity would fling"
4144,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,O'er perjuries committed for John Lyle King.
4145,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,
4146,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"At night, when as the camp-fire cast a ruddy, genial flame,"
4147,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,He'd bring his tuneful fiddle out and play upon the same;
4148,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,No diabolic engine this--no instrument of sin--
4149,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"No relative at all to that lewd toy, the violin!"
4150,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,But a godly hoosier fiddle--a quaint archaic thing
4151,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,Full of all the proper melodies our grandmas used to sing;
4152,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"With ""Bonnie Doon,"" and ""Nellie Gray,"" and ""Sitting on the Stile,"""
4153,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"""The Heart Bowed Down,"" the ""White Cockade,"" and ""Charming Annie Lisle"""
4154,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,Our hearts would echo and the sombre empyrean ring
4155,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,Beneath the wizard sorcery of John Lyle King.
4156,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,
4157,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,The subsequent proceedings should interest me no more--
4158,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,Wrapped in a woolen blanket should I calmly dream and snore;
4159,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,The finny game that swims by day is my supreme delight--
4160,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,And _not_ the scaly game that flies in darkness of the night!
4161,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,Let those who are so minded pursue this latter game
4162,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,But not repine if they should lose a boodle in the same;
4163,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,For an example to you all one paragon should serve--
4164,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,He towers a very monument to valor and to nerve;
4165,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"No bob-tail flush, no nine-spot high, no measly pair can wring"
4166,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,A groan of desperation from John Lyle King!
4167,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,
4168,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,A truce to badinage--I hope far distant is the day
4169,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,When from these scenes terrestrial our friend shall pass away!
4170,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"We like to hear his cheery voice uplifted in the land,"
4171,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"To see his calm, benignant face, to grasp his honest hand;"
4172,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"We like him for his learning, his sincerity, his truth,"
4173,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"His gallantry to woman and his kindliness to youth,"
4174,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"For the lenience of his nature, for the vigor of his mind,"
4175,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,For the fulness of that charity he bears to all mankind--
4176,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,That's why we folks who know him best so reverently cling
4177,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,(And that is why I pen these lines) to John Lyle King.
4178,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,
4179,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"And now adieu, a fond adieu to thee, O muse of rhyme--"
4180,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,I do remand thee to the shades until that happier time
4181,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"When fields are green, and posies gay are budding everywhere,"
4182,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,And there's a smell of clover bloom upon the vernal air;
4183,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"When by the pond out yonder the redwing blackbird calls,"
4184,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,And distant hills are wed to Spring in veils of water-falls;
4185,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,When from his aqueous element the famished pickerel springs
4186,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,Two hundred feet into the air for butterflies and things--
4187,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,"_Then_ come again, O gracious muse, and teach me how to sing"
4188,A DREAM OF SUNSHINE,The glory of a fishing cruise with John Lyle King!
