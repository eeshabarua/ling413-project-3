13,,"Most of this etext was made with a ""Top Scan"" text scanner, with a bit"
14,,of correcting here and there. Mr. Riley does spell pretty=purty and
15,,"such things and have been left as printed, including the first poem"
16,,"in this book listed as ""Proem"" on both the contents page and the"
17,,"page headers, even though in later editions this poem is simply called"
18,,"""Afterwhiles."" In ""The South Wind and the Sun"" the line is 'Laughed out in"
19,,"every look.' while in later versions it has the word 'nook', replacing"
20,,"'look.' The poem ""Old Aunt Mary's"" is later retitled ""Out To Old Aunt"
21,,"Mary's"" and later enlarged by 13 verses. The ""In Dalect"" section has the '"

23,,"including words like sure-enuff he writes as sho'-nuff, or He'pless as"
24,,helpless and ect. This etext is based on the 1898 edition Published by The

128,,Where are they-- the Afterwhiles--
129,,Luring us the lengthening miles
130,,Of our lives? Where is the dawn
131,,With the dew across the lawn
132,,Stroked with eager feet the far
133,,Way the hills and valleys are?
134,,Were the sun that smites the frown
135,,Of the eastward-gazer down?
136,,Where the rifted wreaths of mist
137,,"O'er us, tinged with amethyst,"
138,,Round the mountain's steep defiles?
139,,Where are the afterwhiles?
140,,
141,,Afterwhile-- and we will go
142,,"Thither, yon, and too and fro--"
143,,From the stifling city streets
144,,To the country's cool retreats--
145,,From the riot to the rest
146,,Were hearts beat the placidest:
147,,"Afterwhile, and we will fall"
148,,"Under breezy trees, and loll"
149,,"In the shade, with thirsty sight"
150,,Drinking deep the blue delight
151,,Of the skies that will beguile
152,,Us as children-- afterwhile.
153,,
154,,Afterwhile-- and one intends
155,,"To be gentler to his friends--,"
156,,"To walk with them, in the hush"
157,,"Of still evenings, o'er the plush"
158,,"Of home-leading fields, and stand"
159,,"Long at parting, hand in hand:"
160,,"One, in time, will joy to take"
161,,"New resolves for some one's sake,"
162,,And wear then the look that lies
163,,Clear and pure in other eyes--
164,,We will soothe and reconcile
165,,His own conscience-- afterwhile.
166,,
167,,Afterwhile-- we have in view
168,,"A far scene to journey to--,"
169,,"Where the old home is, and where"
170,,"The old mother waits us there,"
171,,"Peering, as the time grows late,"
172,,Down the old path to the gate--.
173,,How we'll click the latch that locks
174,,"In the pinks and hollyhocks,"
175,,And leap up the path once more
176,,Where she waits us at the door--!
177,,"How we'll greet the dear old smile,"
178,,And the warm tears-- afterwhile!
179,,
180,,"Ah, the endless afterwhiles--!"
181,,"Leagues on leagues, and miles on miles,"
182,,"In distance far withdrawn,"
183,,"Stretching on, and on, and on,"
184,,Till the fancy is footsore
185,,And faints in the dust before
186,,"The last milestone's granite face,"
187,,Hacked with: Here Beginneth Space.
188,,"O far glimmering worlds and wings,"
189,,"Mystic smiles and beckonings,"
190,,Lead us through the shadowy aisles
191,,Out into the afterwhiles.
192,,
193,,
194,,_Herr Weiser_
195,,
196,,"Herr Weiser--! Three-score-years-and-ten--,"
197,,"A hale white rose of his country-men,"
198,,"Transplanted here in the Hoosier loam,"
199,,And blossomy as his German home--
200,,As blossomy and as pure and sweet
201,,"As the cool green glen of his calm retreat,"
202,,Far withdrawn from the noisy town
203,,"Where trade goes clamoring up and down,"
204,,"Whose fret and fever, and stress and strife,"
205,,May not trouble his tranquil life!
206,,
207,,"Breath of rest, what a balmy gust--!"
208,,"Quite of the city's heat and dust,"
209,,"Jostling down by the winding road,"
210,,Through the orchard ways of his quaint abode--.
211,,"Tether the horse, as we onward fare"
212,,"Under the pear-trees trailing there,"
213,,And thumping the wood bridge at night
214,,"With lumps of ripeness and lush delight,"
215,,"Till the stream, as it maunders on till dawn,"
216,,Is powdered and pelted and smiled upon.
217,,
218,,"Herr Weiser, with his wholesome face,"
219,,"And the gentle blue of his eyes, and grace"
220,,"Of unassuming honesty,"
221,,Be there to welcome you and me!
222,,And what though the toil of the farm be stopped
223,,"And the tireless plans of the place be dropped,"
224,,While the prayerful master's knees are set
225,,In beds of pansy and mignonette
226,,"And lily and aster and columbine,"
227,,"Offered in love, as yours and mine--?"
228,,
229,,"What, but a blessing of kindly thought,"
230,,Sweet as the breath of forget-me-not--!
231,,"What, but a spirit of lustrous love"
232,,White as the aster he bends above--!
233,,"What, but an odorous memory"
234,,"Of the dear old man, made known to me"
235,,"In days demanding a help like his--,"
236,,As sweet as the life of the lily is--
237,,"As sweet as the soul of a babe, bloom-wise"
238,,Born of a lily in paradise.
239,,
240,,_The Beautiful City_
241,,
242,,The Beautiful City! Forever
243,,Its rapturous praises resound;
244,,We fain would behold it-- but never
245,,A glimpse of its dory is found:
246,,We slacken our lips at the tender
247,,White breasts of our mothers to hear
248,,Of its marvellous beauty and splendor--;
249,,We see-- but the gleam of a tear!
250,,
251,,Yet never the story may tire us--
252,,First graven in symbols of stone--
253,,Rewritten on scrolls of papyrus
254,,"And parchment, and scattered and blown"
255,,"By the winds of the tongues of all nations,"
256,,Like a litter of leaves wildly whirled
257,,"Down the rack of a hundred translations,"
258,,From the earliest lisp of the world.
259,,
260,,"We compass the earth and the ocean,"
261,,"From the Orient's uttermost light,"
262,,To where the last ripple in motion
263,,"Lips hem of the skirt of the night--,"
264,,But the Beautiful City evades us--
265,,No spire of it glints in the sun--
266,,No glad-bannered battlement shades us
267,,When all our Journey is done.
268,,
269,,Where lies it? We question and listen;
270,,"We lean from the mountain, or mast,"
271,,"And see but dull earth, or the glisten"
272,,Of seas inconceivably vast:
273,,"The dust of the one blurs our vision,"
274,,"The glare of the other our brain,"
275,,Nor city nor island Elysian
276,,In all of the land or the main!
277,,
278,,We kneel in dim fanes where the thunders
279,,"Of organs tumultuous roll,"
280,,"And the longing heart listens and wonders,"
281,,And the eyes look aloft from the soul:
282,,"But the chanson grows fainter and fainter,"
283,,Swoons wholly away and is dead;
284,,AND our eyes only reach where the painter
285,,Has dabbled a saint overhead.
286,,
287,,"The Beautiful City! O mortal,"
288,,"Fare hopefully on in thy quest,"
289,,Pass down through the green grassy portal
290,,That leads to the Valley of Rest;
291,,"There first passed the One who, in pity"
292,,"Of all thy great yearning, awaits"
293,,"To point out The Beautiful City,"
294,,And loosen the trump at the gates.
295,,
296,,
297,,_Lockerbie Street_
298,,
299,,"Such a dear little street it is, nestled away"
300,,"From the noise of the city and heat of the day,"
301,,"In cool shady coverts of whispering trees,"
302,,With their leaves lifted up to shake hands with the breeze
303,,Which in all its wide wanderings never may meet
304,,With a resting-place fairer than Lockerbie street!
305,,
306,,"There is such a relief, from the clangor and din"
307,,"Of the heart of the town, to go loitering in"
308,,"Through the dim, narrow walks, with the sheltering shade"
309,,"Of the trees waving over the long promenade,"
310,,And littering lightly the ways of our feet
311,,With the gold of the sunshine of Lockerbie street.
312,,
313,,"And the nights that come down the dark pathways of dusk,"
314,,"With the stars in their tresses, and odors of musk"
315,,"In their moon-woven raiments, bespangled with dews,"
316,,And looped up with lilies for lovers to use
317,,In the songs that they sing to the tinkle and beat
318,,Of their sweet serenadings through Lockerbie street.
319,,
320,,O my Lockerbie street!  You are fair to be seen--
321,,"Be it noon of the day, or the rare and serene"
322,,"Afternoon of the night-- you are one to my heart,"
323,,"And I love you above all the phrases of art,"
324,,For no language could frame and no lips could repeat
325,,My rhyme-haunted raptures of Lockerbie street.
326,,
327,,
328,,_Das Krist Kindel_
329,,
330,,"I had fed the fire and stirred it, till the sparkles in delight"
331,,Snapped their saucy little fingers at the chill December night;
332,,"And in dressing-gown and slippers, I had tilted back ""my throne--"""
333,,The old split-bottomed rocker-- and was musing all alone.
334,,
335,,"I could hear the hungry Winter prowling round the outer door,"
336,,And the tread of muffled footsteps on the white piazza floor;
337,,But the sounds came to me only as the murmur of a stream
338,,That mingled with the current of a lazy-flowing dream.
339,,
340,,"Like a fragrant incense rising, curled the smoke of my cigar,"
341,,With the lamplight gleaming through it like a mist-enfolded star--;
342,,"And as I gazed, the vapor like a curtain rolled away,"
343,,"With a sound of bells that tinkled, and the clatter of a sleigh."
344,,
345,,"And in a vision, painted like a picture in the air,"
346,,"I saw the elfish figure, of a man with frosty hair--"
347,,"A quaint old man that chuckled with a laugh as he appeared,"
348,,And with ruddy cheeks like embers in the ashes of his beard.
349,,
350,,"He poised himself grotesquely, in an attitude of mirth,"
351,,On a damask-covered hassock that was sitting on the hearth;
352,,"And at a magic signal of his stubbly little thumb,"
353,,I saw the fireplace changing to a bright proscenium.
354,,
355,,"And looking there, I marvelled as I saw a mimic stage"
356,,Alive with little actors of a very tender age;
357,,"And some so very tiny that they tottered as they walked,"
358,,"And lisped and purled and gurgled like the brooklets, when they talked."
359,,
360,,"And their faces were like lilies, and their eyes like purest dew,"
361,,And their tresses like the shadows that the shine is woven through;
362,,"And they each had little burdens, and a little tale to tell"
363,,"Of fairy lore, and giants, and delights delectable."
364,,
365,,"And they mixed and intermingled, weaving melody with joy,"
366,,Till the magic circle clustered round a blooming baby-boy;
367,,"And they threw aside their treasures in an ecstasy of glee,"
368,,"And bent, with dazzled faces and with parted lips, to see."
369,,
370,,"'Twas a wondrous little fellow, with a dainty double-chin"
371,,"And chubby-cheeks, and dimples for the smiles to blossom in;"
372,,"And he looked as ripe and rosy, on his bed of straw and reeds,"
373,,As a mellow little pippin that had tumbled in the weeds.
374,,
375,,"And I saw the happy mother, and a group surrounding her"
376,,That knelt with costly presents of frankincense and myrrh;
377,,"And I thrilled with awe and wonder, as a murmur on the air"
378,,Came drifting o'er the hearing in a melody of prayer--:
379,,
380,,"By the splendor in the heavens, and the hush upon the sea,"
381,,"And the majesty of silence reigning over Galilee,"
382,,"We feel Thy kingly presence, and we humbly bow the knee"
383,,And lift our hearts and voices in gratefulness to Thee.
384,,
385,,"Thy messenger has spoken, and our doubts have fled and gone"
386,,As the dark and spectral shadows of the night before the dawn;
387,,"And in kindly shelter of the light around us drawn,"
388,,We would nestle down forever in the breast we lean upon.
389,,
390,,"You have given us a shepherd-- You have given us a guide,"
391,,"And the light of Heaven grew dimmer when You sent him from Your side--,"
392,,But he comes to lead Thy children where the gates will open wide
393,,To welcome his returning when his works are glorified.
394,,
395,,"By the splendor in the heavens, and the hush upon the sea,"
396,,"And the majesty of silence reigning over Galilee--,"
397,,"We feel Thy kingly presence, and we humbly bow the knee"
398,,And lift our hearts and voices in gratefulness to Thee.
399,,
400,,"Then the vision, slowly failing, with the words of the refrain,"
401,,Fell swooning in the moonlight through the frosty window-pane;
402,,"And I heard the clock proclaiming, like an eager sentinel"
403,,"Who brings the world good tidings--, ""It is Christmas-- all is well!"""
404,,
405,,
406,,_Anselmo_
407,,
408,,"Years did I vainly seek the good Lord's grace--,"
409,,"Prayed, fasted, and did penance dire and dread;"
410,,"Did kneel, with bleeding knees and rainy face,"
411,,"And mouth the dust, with ashes on my head;"
412,,"Yea, still with knotted scourge the flesh I flayed,"
413,,"Rent fresh the wounds, and moaned and shrieked insanely;"
414,,"And froth oozed with the pleadings that I made,"
415,,"And yet I prayed on vainly, vainly, vainly!"
416,,
417,,"A time, from out of swoon I lifted eye,"
418,,"To find a wretched outcast, gray and grim,"
419,,"Bathing my brow, with many a pitying sigh,"
420,,And I did pray God's grace might rest on him--.
421,,"Then, lo! A gentle voice fell on mine ears--"
422,,"""Thou shalt not sob in suppliance hereafter;"
423,,"Take up thy prayers and wring them dry of tears,"
424,,"And lift them, white and pure with love and laughter!"""
425,,
426,,So is it now for all men else I pray;
427,,So is it I am blest and glad alway.
428,,
429,,
430,,_A Home-Made Fairy Tale_
431,,
432,,"Bud, come here to your uncle a spell,"
433,,And I'll tell you something you mustn't tell--
434,,"For it's a secret and shore-'nuf true,"
435,,And maybe I oughtn't to tell it to you--!
436,,"But out in the garden, under the shade"
437,,"Of the apple-trees, where we romped and played"
438,,"Till the moon was up, and you thought I'd gone"
439,,"Fast asleep--, That was all put on!"
440,,For I was a-watchin' something queer
441,,"Goin' on there in the grass, my dear--!"
442,,"'Way down deep in it, there I see"
443,,"A little dude-Fairy who winked at me,"
444,,"And snapped his fingers, and laughed as low"
445,,And fine as the whine of a mus-kee-to!
446,,I kept still-- watchin' him closer-- and
447,,"I noticed a little guitar in his hand,"
448,,Which he leant 'ginst a little dead bee-- and laid
449,,"His cigarette down on a clean grass-blade,"
450,,And then climbed up on the shell of a snail--
451,,Carefully dusting his swallowtail--
452,,"And pulling up, by a waxed web-thread,"
453,,"This little guitar, you remember. I said!"
454,,"And there he trinkled and trilled a tune--,"
455,,"""My Love, so Fair, Tans in the Moon!"""
456,,"Till presently, out of the clover-top"
457,,"He seemed to be singing to, came k'pop!"
458,,"The purtiest, daintiest Fairy face"
459,,"In all this world, or any place!"
460,,"Then the little ser'nader waved his hand,"
461,,"As much as to say, ""We'll excuse you!"" and"
462,,"I heard, as I squinted my eyelids to,"
463,,A kiss like the drip of a drop of dew!
464,,
465,,
466,,_The South Wind and the Sun_
467,,
468,,O The South Wind and the Sun!
469,,How each loved the other one
470,,Full of fancy--- full folly--
471,,Full of jollity and fun!
472,,"How they romped and ran about,"
473,,"Like two boys when school is out,"
474,,"With glowing face, and lisping lip,"
475,,"Low laugh, and lifted shout!"
476,,
477,,And the South Wind-- he was dressed
478,,With a ribbon round his breast
479,,"That floated, flapped and fluttered"
480,,"In a riotous unrest,"
481,,And a drapery of mist
482,,From the shoulder and the wrist
483,,Flowing backward with the motion
484,,Of the waving hand he kissed.
485,,
486,,And the Sun had on a crown
487,,"Wrought of gilded thistle-down,"
488,,"And a scarf of velvet vapor,"
489,,And a ravelled-rainbow gown;
490,,"And his tinsel-tangled hair,"
491,,"Tossed and lost upon the air,"
492,,Was glossier and flossier
493,,Than any anywhere.
494,,
495,,And the South Wind's eyes were two
496,,"Little dancing drops of dew,"
497,,"As he puffed his cheeks, and pursed his lips,"
498,,And blew and blew and blew!
499,,"And the Sun's-- like diamond-stone,"
500,,"Brighter yet than ever known,"
501,,"As he knit his brows and held his breath,"
502,,And shone and shone and shone!
503,,
504,,And this pair of merry fays
505,,Wandered through the summer days;
506,,Arm-in-arm they went together
507,,Over heights of morning haze--
508,,Over slanting slopes of lawn
509,,"They went on and on and on,"
510,,Where the daisies looked like star-tracks
511,,Trailing up and down the dawn.
512,,
513,,And where'er they found the top
514,,Of a wheat-stalk droop and lop
515,,They chucked it underneath the chin
516,,"And praised the lavish crop,"
517,,Till it lifted with the pride
518,,"Of the heads it grew beside,"
519,,And then the South Wind and the Sun
520,,Went onward satisfied.
521,,
522,,"Over meadow-lands they tripped,"
523,,Where the dandelions dipped
524,,"In crimson foam of clover-bloom,"
525,,And dripped and dripped and dripped;
526,,"And they clinched the bumble-stings,"
527,,"Gauming honey on their wings,"
528,,"And bundling them in lily-bells,"
529,,With maudlin murmurings.
530,,
531,,And the humming-bird that hung
532,,Like a jewel up among
533,,"The tilted honeysuckle-horns,"
534,,"They mesmerized, and swung"
535,,"In the palpitating air,"
536,,"Drowsed with odors strange and rare,"
537,,"And with whispered laughter, slipped away,"
538,,And left him hanging there.
539,,
540,,And they braided blades of grass
541,,Where the truant had to pass;
542,,And they wriggled through the rushes
543,,"And the reeds of the morass,"
544,,"Where they danced, in rapture sweet,"
545,,O'er the leaves that laid a street
546,,Of undulant mosaic for
547,,The touches of their feet.
548,,
549,,By the brook with mossy brink
550,,Where the cattle came to drink.
551,,They trilled and piped and whistled
552,,"With the thrush and bobolink,"
553,,"Till the kine in listless pause,"
554,,"Switched their tails in mute applause,"
555,,"With lifted heads and dreamy eyes,"
556,,And bubble-dripping jaws.
557,,
558,,"And where the melons grew,"
559,,"Streaked with yellow, green and blue"
560,,These jolly sprites went wandering
561,,Through spangled paths of dew;
562,,"And the melons, here and there,"
563,,"They made love to, everywhere"
564,,Turning their pink souls to crimson
565,,With caresses fond and fair.
566,,
567,,"Over orchard walls they went,"
568,,Where the fruited boughs were bent
569,,Till they brushed the sward beneath them
570,,Where the shine and shadow blent;
571,,And the great green pear they shook
572,,Till the sallow hue forsook
573,,"Its features, and the gleam of gold"
574,,Laughed out in every look.
575,,
576,,And they stroked the downy cheek
577,,"Of the peach, and smoothed it sleek,"
578,,And flushed it into splendor;
579,,"And with many an elfish freak,"
580,,Gave the russet's rust a wipe--
581,,"Prankt the rambo with a stripe,"
582,,And the wine-sap blushed its reddest
583,,As they spanked the pippins ripe.
584,,
585,,Through the woven ambuscade
586,,"That the twining vines had made,"
587,,"They found the grapes, in clusters,"
588,,Drinking up the shine and shade--
589,,"Plumpt like tiny skins of wine,"
590,,With a vintage so divine
591,,That the tongue of fancy tingled
592,,With the tang of muscadine.
593,,
594,,"And the golden-banded bees,"
595,,"Droning o'er the flowery leas,"
596,,"They bridled, reigned, and rode away"
597,,"Across the fragrant breeze,"
598,,Till in hollow oak and elm
599,,They had groomed and stabled them
600,,In waxen stalls oozed with dews
601,,Of rose and lily-stem.
602,,
603,,"Where the dusty highway leads,"
604,,High above the wayside weeds
605,,They sowed the air with butterflies
606,,"Like blooming flower-seeds,"
607,,Till the dull grasshopper sprung
608,,"Half a man's height up, and hung"
609,,"Tranced in the heat, with whirring wings,"
610,,And sung and sung and sung!
611,,
612,,"And they loitered, hand in hand,"
613,,Where the snipe along the sand
614,,Of the river ran to meet them
615,,"As the ripple meets the land,"
616,,"Till the dragon-fly, in light"
617,,"Gauzy armor, burnished bright,"
618,,Came tilting down the waters
619,,"In a wild, bewildered flight."
620,,
621,,"And they heard the killdee's call,"
622,,"And afar, the waterfall,"
623,,But the rustle of a falling leaf
624,,They heard above it all;
625,,And the trailing willow crept
626,,Deeper in the tide that swept
627,,"The leafy shallop to the shore,"
628,,And wept and wept and wept!
629,,
630,,And the fairy vessel veered
631,,From its moorings-- tacked and steered
632,,For the centre of the current
633,,Sailed away and disappeared:
634,,And the burthen that it bore
635,,From the long-enchanted shore--
636,,"""Alas! The South Wind and the Sun!"""
637,,I murmur evermore.
638,,
639,,"For the South Wind and the Sun,"
640,,"Each so loves the other one,"
641,,For all his jolly folly
642,,"And frivolity and fun,"
643,,That our love for them they weigh
644,,"As their fickle fancies may,"
645,,"And when at last we love them most,"
646,,They laugh and sail away.

649,,_The Lost Kiss_
650,,
651,,"I put by the half-written poem,"
652,,"While the pen, idly trailed in my hand,"
653,,"Writes on--, ""Had I words to complete it,"
654,,"Who'd read it, or who'd understand?"""
655,,"But the little bare feet on the stairway,"
656,,"And the faint, smothered laugh in the hall,"
657,,"And the eerie-low lisp on the silence,"
658,,Cry up to me over it all.
659,,
660,,So I gather it up-- where was broken
661,,"The tear-faded thread of my theme,"
662,,"Telling how, as one night I sat writing,"
663,,"A fairy broke in on my dream,"
664,,A little inquisitive fairy--
665,,"My own little girl, with the gold"
666,,"Of the sun in her hair, and the dewy"
667,,Blue eyes of the fairies of old.
668,,
669,,'Twas the dear little girl that I scolded--
670,,"""For was it a moment like this,"""
671,,"I said, ""when she knew I was busy,"
672,,To come romping in for a kiss--?
673,,"Come rowdying up from her mother,"
674,,And clamoring there at my knee
675,,"For 'One 'ittle kiss for my dolly,"
676,,"And one 'ittle uzzer for me!"""
677,,
678,,"God pity, the heart that repelled her,"
679,,"And the cold hand that turned her away,"
680,,"And take, from the lips that denied her,"
681,,This answerless prayer of to-day!
682,,"Take Lord, from my mem'ry forever"
683,,"That pitiful sob of despair,"
684,,"And the patter and trip of the little bare feet,"
685,,And the one piercing cry on the stair!
686,,
687,,"I put by the half-written poem,"
688,,"While the pen, idly trailed in my hand"
689,,"Writes on--, ""Had I words to complete it"
690,,"Who'd read it, or who'd understand?"""
691,,"But the little bare feet on the stairway,"
692,,"And the faint, smothered laugh in the hall,"
693,,"And the eerie-low lisp on the silence,"
694,,Cry up to me over it all.
695,,
696,,
697,,_The Sphinx_
698,,
699,,I know all about the Sphinx--
700,,"I know even what she thinks,"
701,,Staring with her stony eyes
702,,Up forever at the skies.
703,,
704,,For last night I dreamed that she
705,,Told me all the mystery--
706,,Why for aeons mute she sat--:
707,,She was just cut out for that!
708,,
709,,
710,,_If I knew What Poets Know_
711,,
712,,"If I knew what poets know,"
713,,Would I write a rhyme
714,,Of the buds that never blow
715,,In the summer-time ?
716,,Would I sing of golden seeds
717,,Springing up in ironweeds?
718,,"And of raindrops turned to snow,"
719,,If I knew what poets know?
720,,
721,,"Did I know what poets do,"
722,,Would I sing a song
723,,Sadder than the pigeon's coo
724,,When the days are long?
725,,"Where I found a heart in pain,"
726,,I would make it glad again;
727,,"And the false should be the true,"
728,,Did I know what poets do.
729,,
730,,"If I knew what poets know,"
731,,I would find a theme
732,,Sweeter than the placid flow
733,,Of the fairest dream:
734,,I would sing of love that lives
735,,On the errors it forgives;
736,,And the world would better grow
737,,If I knew what poets know.

740,,_Ike Walton's Prayer_

742,,"I crave, dear Lord,"
743,,No boundless hoard
744,,"Of gold and gear,"
745,,"Nor jewels fine,"
746,,"Nor lands, nor kine,"
747,,Nor treasure-heaps of anything--.
748,,Let but a little hut be mine
749,,Where at the hearthstone I may hear
750,,"The cricket sing,"
751,,And have the shine
752,,"Of one glad woman's eyes to make,"
753,,"For my poor sake,"
754,,Our simple home a place divine--;
755,,Just the wee cot-- the cricket's chirr--
756,,Love and the smiling face of her.
757,,
758,,I pray not for
759,,"Great riches, nor"
760,,"For vast estates and castle-halls--,"
761,,Give me to hear the bare footfalls
762,,Of children o'er
763,,An oaken floor
764,,"New-rinsed with sunshine, or bespread"
765,,With but the tiny coverlet
766,,And pillow for the baby's head;
767,,"And pray Thou, may"
768,,The door stand open and the day
769,,"Send ever in a gentle breeze,"
770,,"With fragrance from the locust-trees,"
771,,"And drowsy moan of doves, and blur"
772,,"Of robin-chirps, and drone of bees,"
773,,With after-hushes of the stir
774,,"Of intermingling sounds, and then"
775,,The good-wife and the smile of her
776,,Filling the silences again--
777,,The cricket's call
778,,"And the wee cot,"
779,,"Dear Lord of all,"
780,,Deny me not!
781,,
782,,I pray not that
783,,Men tremble at
784,,My power of place
785,,"And lordly sway--,"
786,,I only pray for simple grace
787,,To look my neighbor in the face
788,,Full honestly from day to day--
789,,Yield me his horny palm to hold.
790,,And I'll not pray
791,,For gold--;
792,,"The tanned face, garlanded with mirth,"
793,,It hath the kingliest smile on earth;
794,,"The swart brow, diamonded with sweat,"
795,,Hath never need of coronet.
796,,"And so I reach,"
797,,"Dear Lord, to Thee,"
798,,And do beseech
799,,Thou givest me

804,,_A Rough Sketch_
805,,
806,,"I caught, for a second, across the crowd--"
807,,"Just for a second, and barely that--"
808,,"A face, pox-pitted and evil-browed,"
809,,Hid in the shade of a slouch-rim'd hat--
810,,"With small gray eyes, of a look as keen"
811,,"As the long, sharp nose that grew between."
812,,
813,,"And I said: 'Tis a sketch of Nature's own,"
814,,"Drawn i' the dark o' the moon, I swear,"
815,,On a tatter of Fate that the winds have blown
816,,Hither and thither and everywhere--
817,,"With its keen little sinister eyes of gray,"
818,,And nose like the beak of a bird of prey!

824,,The kind of a man for you and me!
825,,"He faces the world unflinchingly,"
826,,"And smites, as long as the wrong resists,"
827,,With a knuckled faith and force like fists:
828,,"He lives the life he is preaching of,"
829,,And loves where most is the need of love;
830,,"His voice is clear to the deaf man's ears,"
831,,And his face sublime through the blind man's tears;
832,,"The light shines out where the clouds were dim,"
833,,And the widow's prayer goes up for him;
834,,The latch is clicked at the hovel door
835,,"And the sick man sees the sun once more,"
836,,And out o'er the barren fields he sees
837,,"Springing blossoms and waving trees,"
838,,"Feeling as only the dying may,"
839,,"That God's own servant has come that way,"
840,,Smoothing the path as it still winds on
841,,Through the golden gate where his loved have gone.
842,,
843,,2
844,,The kind of a man for me and you!
845,,However little of worth we do
846,,"He credits full, and abides in trust"
847,,That time will teach us how more is just.
848,,"He walks abroad, and he meets all kinds"
849,,"Of querulous and uneasy minds,"
850,,"And sympathizing, he shares the pain"
851,,"Of the doubts that rack us, heart and brain;"
852,,"And knowing this, as we grasp his hand"
853,,We are surely coming to understand!
854,,He looks on sin with pitying eyes--
855,,"E'en as the Lord, since Paradise--,"
856,,"Else, should we read, Though our sins should glow"
857,,"As scarlet, they shall be white as snow--?"
858,,"And feeling still, with a grief half glad,"
859,,"That the bad are as good as the good are bad,"
860,,He strikes straight out for the Right-- and he
861,,Is the kind of a man for you and me!

864,,_The Harper_
865,,
866,,Like a drift of faded blossoms
867,,"Caught in a slanting rain,"
868,,His fingers glimpsed down the strings of his harp
869,,In a tremulous refrain:
870,,
871,,"Patter and tinkle, and drip and drip!"
872,,Ah! But the chords were rainy sweet!
873,,"And I closed my eyes and I bit my lip,"
874,,As he played there in the street.
875,,
876,,"Patter, and drip, and tinkle!"
877,,And there was the little bed
878,,"In the corner of the garret,"
879,,And the rafters overhead!
880,,
881,,And there was the little window--
882,,"Tinkle, and drip, and drip--!"

884,,And God's companionship!

890,,In those old days of the lost sunshine
891,,"Of youth-- when the Saturday's chores were through,"
892,,"And the ""Sunday's wood"" in the kitchen too,"
893,,"And we went visiting, ""me and you,"""
894,,Out to Old Aunt Mary's?
895,,
896,,It all comes back so clear to-day!
897,,Though I am as bald as you are gray--
898,,"Out by the barn-lot, and down the lane,"
899,,"We patter along in the dust again,"
900,,"As light as the tips of the drops of the rain,"
901,,Out to Old Aunt Mary's!
902,,
903,,"We cross the pasture, and through the wood"
904,,"Where the old gray snag of the poplar stood,"
905,,"Where the hammering ""red-heads"" hopped awry,"
906,,"And the buzzard ""raised"" in the ""clearing"" sky"
907,,"And lolled and circled, as we went by"
908,,Out to Old Aunt Mary's.
909,,
910,,And then in the dust of the road again;
911,,"And the teams we met, and the countrymen;"
912,,"And the long highway, with sunshine spread"
913,,"As thick as butter on country bread,"
914,,"Our cares behind, and our hearts ahead"
915,,Out to Old Aunt Mary's.
916,,
917,,"Why, I see her now in the open door,"
918,,Where the little gourds grew up the sides and o'er
919,,"The clapboard roof--! And her face-- ah, me!"
920,,Wasn't it good for a boy to see--
921,,And wasn't it good for a boy to be
922,,Out to Old Aunt Mary's?
923,,
924,,"The jelly-- the Jam and the marmalade,"
925,,"And the cherry and quince ""preserves'' she made!"
926,,"And the sweet-sour pickles of peach and pear,"
927,,"With cinnamon in 'em, and all things rare--!"
928,,"And the more we ate was the more to spare,"
929,,Out to Old Aunt Mary's!
930,,
931,,And the old spring-house in the cool green gloom
932,,"Of the willow-trees--, and the cooler room"
933,,Where the swinging-shelves and the crocks were kept--
934,,Where the cream in a golden languor slept
935,,While the waters gurgled and laughed and wept--
936,,Out to Old Aunt Mary's.
937,,
938,,"And O my brother, so far away,"
939,,This is to tell you she waits to-day

952,,
953,,"Illileo Legardi, in the garden there alone,"
954,,"With your figure carved of fervor, as the Psyche carved of stone,"
955,,There came to me no murmur of the fountain's undertone
956,,"So mystically, musically mellow as your own."
957,,
958,,"You whispered low, Illileo-- so low the leaves were mute,"
959,,And the echoes faltered breathless in your voice's vain pursuit;
960,,And there died the distant dalliance of the serenader's lute:
961,,And I held you in my bosom as the husk may hold the fruit.
962,,
963,,"Illileo, I listened. I believed you. In my bliss,"
964,,What were all the worlds above me since I found you thus in this--?
965,,"Let them reeling reach to win me-- even Heaven I would miss,"
966,,"Grasping earthward--! I would cling here, though I clung by just a kiss."
967,,
968,,And blossoms should grow odorless-- and lilies all aghast--
969,,"And I said the stars should slacken in their paces through the vast,"

979,,_The King_

981,,They rode right out of the morning sun--

985,,"And the king of them all, O he rode ahead,"
986,,"With a helmet of gold, and a plume of red"
987,,That spurted about in the breeze and bled
988,,In the bloom of the everglade.
989,,
990,,"And they rode high over the dewy lawn,"
991,,"With brave, glad banners of every hue"
992,,"That rolled in ripples, as they rode on"
993,,"In splendor, two and two;"
994,,And the tinkling links of the golden reins
995,,Of the steeds they rode rang such refrains
996,,As the castanets in a dream of Spain's
997,,Intensest gold and blue.
998,,
999,,And they rode and rode; and the steeds they neighed
1000,,"And pranced, and the sun on their glossy hides"
1001,,Flickered and lightened and glanced and played
1002,,Like the moon on rippling tides;
1003,,
1004,,"And their manes were silken, and thick and strong,"
1005,,"And their tails were flossy, and fetlock-long,"
1006,,"And jostled in time to the teeming throng,"
1007,,And their knightly song besides.
1008,,
1009,,"Clank of scabbard and jingle of spur,"
1010,,And the fluttering sash of the queen went wild
1011,,"In the wind, and the proud king glanced at her"
1012,,"As one at a wilful child--,"
1013,,"And as knight and lady away they flew,"
1014,,"And the banners flapped, and the falcon too,"
1015,,"And the lances flashed and the bugle blew,"
1016,,He kissed his hand and smiled.
1017,,
1018,,"And then, like a slanting sunlit shower,"
1019,,"The pageant glittered across the plain,"
1020,,"And the turf spun back, and the wildweed flower"
1021,,Was only a crimson stain.
1022,,"And a dreamer's eyes they are downward cast,"
1023,,As he blends these words with the wailing blast:
1024,,"""It is the King of the Year rides past!"""

1034,,"Over her jewels she flung herself drearily,"
1035,,"Crumpled the laces that snowed on her breast,"
1036,,Crushed with her fingers the lily that wearily
1037,,Clung in her hair like a dove in its nest--.
1038,,And naught but her shadowy form in the mirror
1039,,To kneel in dumb agony down and weep near her!
1040,,
1041,,"""Weary--?"" Of what? Could we fathom the mystery--?"
1042,,Lift up the lashes weighed down by her tears
1043,,"And wash with their dews one white face from her history,"
1044,,Set like a gem in the red rust of years?
1045,,Nothing will rest her-- unless he who died of her
1046,,"Strayed from his grave, and in place of the groom,"
1047,,"Tipping her face, kneeling there by the side of her,"

1060,,"Yesterday I thought: ""I know"

1064,,
1065,,This is to-day; and I have no thing

1078,,And the bluebird trills in the orchard tree;
1079,,"And in and out, when the eaves dip rain,"
1080,,The swallows are twittering ceaselessly.

1089,,"In the midnight black, or the mid-day blue:"
1090,,"The robin pipes when the sun is here,"
1091,,And the cricket chirrups the whole night through.
1092,,"The buds may blow, and the fruit may grow,"
1093,,And the autumn leaves drop crisp and sear;

1106,,"If from your own the dimpled hands had slipped,"
1107,,And ne'er would nestle in your palm again;
1108,,"If the white feet into the grave had tripped--"""
1109,,
1110,,When Bessie died--
1111,,"We braided the brown hair, and tied"
1112,,It just as her own little hands
1113,,Had fastened back the silken strands
1114,,A thousand times-- the crimson bit
1115,,Of ribbon woven into it
1116,,That she had worn with childish pride--
1117,,Smoothed down the dainty bow-- and cried
1118,,When Bessie died.
1119,,
1120,,When Bessie died--
1121,,"We drew the nursery blinds aside,"
1122,,And as the morning in the room
1123,,"Burst like a primrose into bloom,"
1124,,Her pet canary's cage we hung
1125,,Where she might hear him when he sung--
1126,,"And yet not any note he tried,"
1127,,Though she lay listening folded-eyed.
1128,,
1129,,When Bessie died--
1130,,We writhed in prayer unsatisfied:
1131,,"We begged of God, and He did smile"
1132,,In silence on us all the while;
1133,,"And we did see Him, through our tears,"
1134,,"Enfolding that fair form of hers,"
1135,,She laughing back against His love
1136,,The kisses had nothing of--
1137,,"And death to us He still denied,"
1138,,When Bessie died--
1139,,When Bessie died.

1142,,_The Shower_

1146,,"Fell on the fields, and in the darkened wild"
1147,,The zephyr held its breath.
1148,,
1149,,No wavering glamour-work of light and shade
1150,,Dappled the shivering surface of the brook;
1151,,The frightened ripples in their ambuscade
1152,,Of willows thrilled and shook.
1153,,
1154,,"The sullen day grew darker, and anon"
1155,,Dim flashes of pent anger lit the sky;
1156,,With rumbling wheels of wrath came rolling on
1157,,The storm's artillery.
1158,,
1159,,"The cloud above put on its blackest frown,"
1160,,"And then, as with a vengeful cry of pain,"
1161,,"The lightning snatched it, ripped and flung it down"
1162,,In ravelled shreds of rain:
1163,,
1164,,"While I, transfigured by some wondrous art,"
1165,,"Bowed with the thirsty lilies to the sod,"
1166,,"My empty soul brimmed over, and my heart"
1167,,Drenched with the love of God.

1204,,Words will not say what I yearn to say--
1205,,"They will not walk as I want them to,"
1206,,But they stumble and fall in the path of the way
1207,,Of my telling my love for you.
1208,,
1209,,Simply take what the scrawl is worth--
1210,,Knowing I love you as sun the sod

1219,,
1220,,"With a cheery smile, and a wave of the hand"

1222,,
1223,,And left us dreaming how very fair

1225,,
1226,,"And you-- O you, who the wildest yearn"
1227,,"For the old-time step and the glad return--,"
1228,,
1229,,"Think of him faring on, as dear"
1230,,In the love of There as the love of Here;

1232,,"And loyal still, as he gave the blows"
1233,,Of his warrior-strength to his country's foes--.
1234,,
1235,,"Mild and gentle, as he was brave--,"
1236,,When the sweetest love of his life he gave
1237,,
1238,,To simple things--: Where the violets grew
1239,,"Blue as the eyes they were likened to,"
1240,,
1241,,The touches of his hands have strayed
1242,,As reverently as his lips have prayed:
1243,,
1244,,When the little brown thrush that harshly chirred
1245,,Was dear to him as the mocking-bird;
1246,,
1247,,And he pitied as much as a man in pain
1248,,A writhing honey-bee wet with rain--.
1249,,
1250,,"Think of him still as the same, I say:"

1258,,"And lifts a mirthful roundelay,"
1259,,"However poor his fortunes be--,"
1260,,He will not fail in any qualm

1265,,Who bides his time-- he tastes the sweet

1291,,"And they met betimes with this maiden,"

1313,,_Fame_
1314,,
1315,,1
1316,,"Once, in a dream, I saw a man,"
1317,,"With haggard face and tangled hair,"
1318,,And eyes that nursed as wild a care
1319,,As gaunt Starvation ever can;
1320,,And in his hand he held a wand
1321,,Whose magic touch gave life and thought
1322,,Unto a form his fancy wrought
1323,,"And robed with coloring so grand,"
1324,,It seemed the reflex of some child
1325,,"Of Heaven, fair and undefiled--"
1326,,A face of purity and love--
1327,,To woo him into worlds above:
1328,,"And as I gazed with dazzled eyes,"
1329,,A gleaming smile lit up his lips
1330,,As his bright soul from its eclipse
1331,,Went flashing into Paradise.
1332,,Then tardy Fame came through the door
1333,,And found a picture-- nothing more.
1334,,
1335,,2
1336,,"And once I saw a man alone,"
1337,,"In abject poverty, with hand"
1338,,Uplifted o'er a block of stone
1339,,That took a shape at his command
1340,,"And smiled upon him, fair and good--"
1341,,"A perfect work of womanhood,"
1342,,"Save that the eyes might never weep,"
1343,,"Nor weary hands be crossed in sleep,"
1344,,"Nor hair that fell from crown to wrist,"
1345,,"Be brushed away, caressed and kissed."
1346,,"And as in awe I gazed on her,"
1347,,I saw the sculptor's chisel fall--
1348,,"I saw him sink, without a moan,"
1349,,"Sink life less at the feet of stone,"
1350,,And lie there like a worshipper.
1351,,"Fame crossed the threshold of the hall,"
1352,,And found a statue-- that was all.
1353,,
1354,,3
1355,,And once I saw a man who drew
1356,,"A gloom about him like cloak,"
1357,,And wandered aimlessly. The few
1358,,"Who spoke of him at all, but spoke"
1359,,Disparagingly of a mind
1360,,The Fates had faultily designed:
1361,,Too indolent for modern times--
1362,,"Too fanciful, and full of whims--"
1363,,"For talking to himself in rhymes,"
1364,,"And scrawling never-heard-of hymns,"
1365,,The idle life to which he clung
1366,,Was worthless as the songs he sung!
1367,,"I saw him, in my vision, filled"
1368,,With rapture o'er a spray of bloom
1369,,The wind threw in his lonely room;
1370,,And of the sweet perfume it spilled
1371,,"He drank to drunkenness, and flung"
1372,,"His long hair back, and laughed and sung"
1373,,And clapped his hands as children do
1374,,"At fairy tales they listen to,"
1375,,While from his flying quill there dripped
1376,,Such music on his manuscript
1377,,That he who listens to the words
1378,,May close his eyes and dream the birds
1379,,Are twittering on every hand
1380,,A language he can understand.
1381,,"He journeyed on through life unknown,"
1382,,Without one friend to call his own;
1383,,He tired. No kindly hand to press
1384,,The cooling touch of tenderness
1385,,"Upon his burning brow, nor lift"
1386,,To his parched lips God's freest gift--
1387,,No sympathetic sob or sigh
1388,,Of trembling lips-- no sorrowing eye
1389,,Looked out through tears to see him die.
1390,,And Fame her greenest laurels brought
1391,,To crown a head that heeded not.
1392,,
1393,,"And this is Fame! A thing indeed,"
1394,,That only comes when least the need:
1395,,The wisest minds of every age
1396,,The book of life from page to page
1397,,Have searched in vain; each lesson conned
1398,,Will promise it the page beyond--
1399,,"Until the last, when dusk of night"
1400,,"Falls over it, and reason's light"
1401,,Is smothered by that unknown friend
1402,,"Who signs his nom de plume, The End."

1407,,The ripest peach is highest on the tree--
1408,,"And so her love, beyond the reach of me,"
1409,,Is dearest in my sight. Sweet breezes bow
1410,,Her heart down to me where I worship now!
1411,,
1412,,She looms aloft where every eye may see
1413,,The ripest peach is highest on the tree.
1414,,"Such fruitage as her love I know, alas!"
1415,,I may not reach here from the orchard grass.
1416,,
1417,,I drink the sunshine showered past her lips
1418,,As roses drain the dewdrop as it drips.
1419,,"The ripest peach is highest on the tree,"
1420,,And so mine eyes gaze upward eagerly.
1421,,
1422,,Why-- why do I not turn away in wrath
1423,,And pluck some heart here hanging in my path--?

1437,,"Over the cottage window-sill,"
1438,,
1439,,Their fragrance down the garden walks
1440,,Where droop the dry-mouthed hollyhocks.

1454,,"High up, through curled green leaves, a pear"

1463,,Until their swollen girths express

1487,,Even as he feels his dazzled own--.
1488,,"Then blindingly, round either thrown,"
1489,,They feel a stress of arms that ever
1490,,"Strain tremblingly-- and ""Never! Never!"""
1491,,
1492,,"Is whispered brokenly, with half"

1657,,"Blossoms crimson, white, or blue,"
1658,,"Purple, pink, and every hue,"
1659,,"From sunny skies, to tintings drowned"
1660,,"In dusky drops of dew,"
1661,,"I praise you all, wherever found,"
1662,,And love you through and through--;
1663,,"But, Blossoms On The Trees,"
1664,,With your breath upon the breeze
1665,,There's nothing all the world around
1666,,As half as sweet as you!
1667,,
1668,,Could the rhymer only wring
1669,,All the sweetness to the lees
1670,,Of all the kisses clustering
1671,,"In juicy Used-to-bes,"
1672,,To dip his rhymes therein and sing
1673,,"The blossoms on the trees--,"
1674,,"""O Blossoms on the Trees,"""
1675,,"He would twitter, trill, and coo,"
1676,,"""However sweet, such songs as these"
1677,,Are not as sweet as you--:
1678,,For you are blooming melodies
1679,,"The eyes may listen to!"""
1680,,
1681,,
1682,,_Last Night-- And This_
1683,,
1684,,Last night-- how deep the darkness was!
1685,,"And well I knew its depths, because"
1686,,"I waded it from shore to shore,"
1687,,Thinking to reach the light no more.
1688,,
1689,,She would not even touch my hand---.
1690,,The winds rose and the cedars fanned
1691,,"The moon out, and the stars fled back"
1692,,In heaven and hid-- and all was black!
1693,,
1694,,"But ah! To-night a summons came,"
1695,,"Signed with a tear-drop for a name,"
1696,,"For as I wondering kissed it, lo"
1697,,A line beneath it told me so.
1698,,
1699,,And now-- the moon hangs over me
1700,,"A disk of dazzling brilliancy,"
1701,,And every star-tip stabs my sights
1702,,With splintered glitterings of light!
1703,,
1704,,
1705,,_A Discouraging Model_
1706,,
1707,,"Just the airiest, fairiest slip of a thing,"
1708,,"With a Gainsborough hat, like a butterfly's wing,"
1709,,"Tilted up at one side with the jauntiest air,"
1710,,And a knot of red roses sown in under there
1711,,Where the shadows are lost in her hair.
1712,,
1713,,"Then a cameo face, carven in on a ground"
1714,,Of that shadowy hair where the roses are wound;
1715,,"And the gleam of a smile, O as fair and as faint"
1716,,And as sweet as the master of old used to paint
1717,,Round the lips of their favorite saint!
1718,,
1719,,And that lace at her throat-- and fluttering hands
1720,,"Snowing there, with a grace that no art understands,"
1721,,The flakes of their touches-- first fluttering at
1722,,The bow-- then the roses-- the hair and then that
1723,,Little tilt of the Gainsborough hat.
1724,,
1725,,"Ah, what artist on earth with a model like this,"
1726,,"Holding not on his palette the tint of a kiss,"
1727,,Nor a pigment to hint of the hue of her hair
1728,,Nor the gold of her smile-- O what artist could dare
1729,,To expect a result half so fair?
1730,,
1731,,
1732,,_Back From a Two-years' Sentence_
1733,,
1734,,Back from a two-years' sentence!
1735,,"And though it had been ten,"
1736,,"You think, I were scarred no deeper"
1737,,In the eyes of my fellow-men.
1738,,"""My fellow-men--?"" Sounds like a satire,"
1739,,"You think-- and I so allow,"
1740,,"Here in my home since childhood,"
1741,,Yet more than a stranger now!
1742,,
1743,,"Pardon--! Not wholly a stranger--,"
1744,,For I have a wife and child:
1745,,"That woman has wept for two long years,"
1746,,And yet last night she smiled--!
1747,,"Smiled, as I leapt from the platform"
1748,,"Of the midnight train, and then--"
1749,,"All that I knew was that smile of hers,"
1750,,And our babe in my arms again!
1751,,
1752,,Back from a two-years' sentence--
1753,,"But I've thought the whole thing through--,"
1754,,A hint of it came when the bars swung back
1755,,And I looked straight up in the blue
1756,,Of the blessed skies with my hat off!
1757,,O-ho! I've a wife and child:
1758,,"That woman has wept for two long years,"
1759,,And yet last night she smiled!
1760,,
1761,,
1762,,_The Wandering Jew_
1763,,
1764,,"The stars are falling, and the sky"
1765,,Is like a field of faded flowers;
1766,,The winds on weary wings go by;
1767,,"The moon hides, and the tempest lowers;"
1768,,And still through every clime and age
1769,,I wander on a pilgrimage
1770,,"That all men know an idle quest,"
1771,,For that the goal I seek is-- Rest!
1772,,
1773,,"I hear the voice of summer streams,"
1774,,"And following, I find the brink"
1775,,"Of cooling springs, with childish dreams"
1776,,Returning as I bend to drink--
1777,,"But suddenly, with startled eyes,"
1778,,My face looks on its grim disguise
1779,,"Of long gray beard; and so, distressed,"
1780,,"I hasten on, nor taste of rest."
1781,,
1782,,I come upon a merry group
1783,,"Of children in the dusky wood,"
1784,,"Who answer back the owlet's whoop,"
1785,,That laughs as it had understood;
1786,,"And I would pause a little space,"
1787,,But that each happy blossom-face
1788,,Is like to one His hands have blessed
1789,,Who sent me forth in search of rest.
1790,,
1791,,Sometimes I fain would stay my feet
1792,,"In shady lanes, where huddled kine"
1793,,"Couch in the grasses cool and sweet,"
1794,,And lift their patient eyes to mine;
1795,,"But I, for thoughts that ever then"
1796,,"Go back to Bethlehem again,"
1797,,"Must needs fare on my weary quest,"
1798,,And weep for very need of rest.
1799,,
1800,,Is there no end? I plead in vain:
1801,,Lost worlds nor living answer me.
1802,,Since Pontius Pilate's awful reign
1803,,Have I not passed eternity?
1804,,Have I not drunk the fetid breath
1805,,"Of every fevered phase of death,"
1806,,And come unscathed through every pest
1807,,And scourge and plague that promised rest?
1808,,
1809,,Have I not seen the stars go out
1810,,"That shed their light o'er Galilee,"
1811,,And mighty kingdoms tossed about
1812,,And crumbled clod-like in the sea?
1813,,Dead ashes of dead ages blow
1814,,"And cover me like drifting snow,"
1815,,And time laughs on as 'twere a jest
1816,,That I have any need of rest.

1818,,_Becalmed_

1820,,1
1821,,Would that the winds might only blow
1822,,As they blew in the golden long ago--!
1823,,Laden with odors of Orient isles
1824,,"Where ever and ever the sunshine smiles,"
1825,,"And the bright sands blend with the shady trees,"
1826,,And the lotus blooms in the midst of these.
1827,,
1828,,2
1829,,Warm winds won from the midland vales
1830,,To where the tress of the Siren trails
1831,,O'er the flossy tip of the mountain phlox
1832,,"And the bare limbs twined in the crested rocks,"
1833,,High above as the seagulls flap
1834,,Their lopping wings at the thunder-clap.
1835,,
1836,,3
1837,,Ah! That the winds might rise and blow
1838,,"The great surge up from the port below,"
1839,,"Bloating the sad, lank, silken sails"
1840,,"Of the Argo out with the swift, sweet gales"
1841,,That blew from Colchis when Jason had
1842,,His love's full will and his heart was glad--
1843,,When Medea's voice was soft and low.
1844,,Ah! That the winds might rise and blow!

1847,,_To Santa Claus_
1848,,
1849,,"Most tangible of all the gods that be,"
1850,,O Santa Claus-- our own since Infancy!
1851,,"As first we scampered to thee-- now, as then,"
1852,,Take us as children to thy heart again.
1853,,
1854,,"Be wholly good to us, just as of old:"
1855,,"As a pleased father, let thine arms infold"
1856,,"Us, homed within the haven of thy love,"
1857,,And all the cheer and wholesomeness thereof.
1858,,
1859,,"Thou lone reality, when O so long"
1860,,Life's unrealities have wrought us wrong:
1861,,"Ambition hath allured us--, fame likewise,"
1862,,And all that promised honor in men's eyes.
1863,,
1864,,"Throughout the world's evasions, wiles, and shifts,"
1865,,Thou only bidest stable as thy gifts--:
1866,,"A grateful king re-ruleth from thy lap,"
1867,,Crowned with a little tinselled soldier-cap:
1868,,
1869,,A mighty general-- a nation's pride--
1870,,"Thou givest again a rocking-horse to ride,"
1871,,And wildly glad he groweth as the grim
1872,,Old jurist with the drum thou givest him:
1873,,
1874,,"The sculptor's chisel, at thy mirth's command,"
1875,,Is as a whistle in his boyish hand;
1876,,"The painters model fadeth utterly,"
1877,,"And there thou standest--, and he painteth thee--:"
1878,,
1879,,"Most like a winter pippin, sound and fine"
1880,,"And tingling-red that ripe old face of thine,"
1881,,Set in thy frosty beard of cheek and chin
1882,,As midst the snows the thaws of spring set in.
1883,,
1884,,Ho! Santa Claus-- our own since Infancy--
1885,,Most tangible of all the gods that be--!
1886,,"As first we scampered to thee-- now, as then,"
1887,,Take us as children to thy heart again.

1889,,
1890,,_Where the Children used to Play_
1891,,
1892,,"The old farm-home is Mother's yet and mine,"
1893,,"And filled it is with plenty and to spare--,"
1894,,"But we are lonely here in life's decline,"
1895,,Though fortune smiles around us everywhere:
1896,,We look across the gold
1897,,"Of the harvests, as of old--"
1898,,"The corn, the fragrant clover, and the hay;"
1899,,"But most we turn our gaze,"
1900,,"As with eyes of other days,"
1901,,To the orchard where the children used to play.
1902,,
1903,,O from our life's full measure
1904,,And rich hoard of worldly treasure
1905,,"We often turn our weary eyes away,"
1906,,And hand in hand we wander
1907,,Down the old path winding yonder
1908,,To the orchard where the children used to play.
1909,,
1910,,Our sloping pasture-lands are filled with herds;
1911,,The barn and granary-bins are bulging o'ver;
1912,,The grove's a paradise of singing birds--
1913,,The woodland brook leaps laughing by the door;
1914,,"Yet lonely, lonely still,"
1915,,"Let us prosper as we will,"
1916,,Our old hearts seem so empty everyway--
1917,,We can only through a mist
1918,,See the faces we have kissed
1919,,In the orchard where the children used to play.
1920,,
1921,,O from our life's full measure
1922,,And rich hoard of worldly treasure
1923,,"We often turn our weary eyes away,"
1924,,And hand in hand we wander
1925,,Down the old path winding yonder

1928,,
1929,,_A Glimpse of Pan_
1930,,
1931,,I caught but a glimpse of him. Summer was here.
1932,,And I strayed from the town and its dust and heat.
1933,,"And walked in a wood, while the noon was near,"
1934,,"Where the shadows were cool, and the atmosphere"
1935,,Was misty with fragrances stirred by my feet
1936,,From surges of blossoms that billowed sheer
1937,,"Of the grasses, green and sweet."
1938,,
1939,,"And I peered through a vista of leaning tree,"
1940,,Tressed with long tangles of vines that swept
1941,,"To the face of a river, that answered these"
1942,,"With vines in the wave like the vines in the breeze,"
1943,,Till the yearning lips of the ripples crept
1944,,"And kissed them, with quavering ecstasies,"
1945,,And wistfully laughed and wept
1946,,
1947,,"And there, like a dream in swoon, I swear"
1948,,"I saw Pan lying--, his limbs in the dew"
1949,,"And the shade, and his face in the dazzle and glare"
1950,,"Of the glad sunshine; while everywhere,"
1951,,"Over across, and around him blew"
1952,,"Filmy dragon-flies hither and there,"
1953,,"And little white butterflies, two and two,"
1954,,In eddies of odorous air.

1962,,_Pan_
1963,,
1964,,"This Pan is but an idle god, I guess,"
1965,,Since all the fair midsummer of my dreams
1966,,"He loiters listlessly by woody streams,"
1967,,Soaking the lush glooms up with laziness;
1968,,Or drowsing while the maiden-winds caress
1969,,"Him prankishly, and powder him with gleams"
1970,,Of sifted sunshine. And he ever seems
1971,,Drugged with a joy unutterable-- unless
1972,,His low pipes whistle hints of it far out
1973,,Across the ripples to the dragon-fly
1974,,"That like a wind-born blossom blown about,"
1975,,"Drops quiveringly down, as though to die--"
1976,,"Then lifts and wavers on, as if in doubt"
1977,,Whether to fan his wings or fly without.
1978,,
1979,,
1980,,_Dusk_
1981,,
1982,,The frightened herds of clouds across the sky
1983,,"Trample the sunshine down, and chase the day"
1984,,Into the dusky forest-lands of gray
1985,,"And sombre twilight. Far and faint, and high,"
1986,,"The wild goose trails his harrow, with a cry"
1987,,Sad as the wail of some poor castaway
1988,,Who sees a vessel drifting far astray
1989,,"Of his last hope, and lays him down to die."
1990,,"The children, riotous from school, grow bold"
1991,,And quarrel with the wind whose angry gust
1992,,"Plucks off the summer-hat, and flaps the fold"
1993,,"Of many a crimson cloak, and twirls the dust"
1994,,"In spiral shapes grotesque, and dims the gold"
1995,,Of gleaming tresses with the blur of rust.
1996,,
1997,,
1998,,_June_
1999,,
2000,,O queenly month of indolent repose!
2001,,"I drink thy breath in sips of rare perfume,"
2002,,As in thy downy lap of clover-bloom
2003,,I nestle like a drowsy child and doze
2004,,The lazy hours away. The zephyr throws
2005,,The shifting shuttle of the Summer's loom
2006,,And weaves a damask-work of gleam and gloom
2007,,Before thy listless feet. The lily blows
2008,,A bugle-call of fragrance o'er the glade;
2009,,"And wheeling into ranks, with plume and spear,"
2010,,Thy harvest-armies gather on parade;
2011,,"While faint and far away, yet pure and clear,"
2012,,A voice calls out of alien lands of shade--:
2013,,All hail the Peerless Goddess of the Year!
2014,,
2015,,
2016,,_Silence_
2017,,
2018,,"Thousands of thousands of hushed years ago,"
2019,,"Out on the edge of Chaos, all alone"
2020,,"I stood on peaks of vapor, high upthrown"
2021,,"Above a sea that knew nor ebb nor flow,"
2022,,"Nor any motion won of winds that blow,"
2023,,"Nor any sound of watery wail or moan,"
2024,,"Nor lisp of wave, nor wandering undertone"
2025,,Of any tide lost in the night below.
2026,,"So still it was, I mind me, as I laid"
2027,,My thirsty ear against mine own faint sigh
2028,,"To drink of that, I sipped it, half afraid"
2029,,'Twas but the ghost of a dead voice spilled by
2030,,The one starved star that tottered through the shade
2031,,And came tiptoeing toward me down the sky.
2032,,
2033,,
2034,,_Sleep_
2035,,
2036,,"Thou drowsy god, whose blurred eyes, half awink"
2037,,"Muse on me--, drifting out upon thy dreams,"
2038,,I lave my soul as in enchanted streams
2039,,"Where revelling satyrs pipe along the brink,"
2040,,"And tipsy with the melody they drink,"
2041,,"Uplift their dangling hooves, and down the beams"
2042,,Of sunshine dance like motes. Thy languor seems
2043,,An ocean-depth of love wherein I sink
2044,,"Like some fond Argonaut, right willingly--,"
2045,,"Because of wooing eyes upturned to mine,"
2046,,And siren-arms that coil their sorcery
2047,,"About my neck, with kisses so divine,"
2048,,"The heavens reel above me, and the sea"
2049,,Swallows and licks its wet lips over me.
2050,,
2051,,
2052,,_Her Hair_
2053,,
2054,,The beauty of her hair bewilders me--
2055,,"Pouring adown the brow, its cloven tide"
2056,,Swirling about the ears on either side
2057,,And storming round the neck tumultuously:
2058,,Or like the lights of old antiquity
2059,,"Through mullioned windows, in cathedrals wide"
2060,,Spilled moltenly o'er figures deified
2061,,"In chastest marble, nude of drapery."
2062,,And so I love it--. Either unconfined;
2063,,Or plaited in close braidings manifold;
2064,,Or smoothly drawn; or indolently twined
2065,,In careless knots whose coilings come unrolled
2066,,At any lightest kiss; or by the wind
2067,,Whipped out in flossy ravellings of gold.
2068,,
2069,,
2070,,_Dearth_
2071,,
2072,,I hold your trembling hand to-night-- and yet
2073,,"I may not know what wealth of bliss is mine,"
2074,,My heart is such a curious design
2075,,Of trust and jealousy! Your eyes are wet--
2076,,"So must I think they jewel some regret--,"
2077,,"And lo, the loving arms that round me twine"
2078,,Cling only as the tendrils of a vine
2079,,"Whose fruit has long been gathered: I forget,"
2080,,While crimson clusters of your kisses press
2081,,"Their wine out on my lips, my royal fair"
2082,,"Of rapture, since blind fancy needs must guess"
2083,,"They once poured out their sweetness otherwhere,"
2084,,With fuller flavoring of happiness
2085,,Than e'en your broken sobs may now declare.

2090,,"It is my dream to have you here with me,"
2091,,Out of the heated city's dust and din--
2092,,"Here where the colts have room to gambol in,"
2093,,"And kine to graze, in clover to the knee."
2094,,I want to see your wan face happily
2095,,Lit with the wholesome smiles that have not been
2096,,In use since the old games you used to win
2097,,When we pitched horseshoes: And I want to be
2098,,At utter loaf with you in this dim land
2099,,"Of grove and meadow, while the crickets make"
2100,,"Our own talk tedious, and the bat wields"
2101,,"His bulky flight, as we cease converse and"
2102,,In a dusk like velvet smoothly take
2103,,Our way toward home across the dewy fields.

2107,,
2108,,The midnight is not more bewildering
2109,,"To her drowsed eyes, than to her ears, the sound"
2110,,"Of dim, sweet singing voices, interwound"
2111,,"With purl of flute and subtle twang of string,"
2112,,"Strained through the lattice, where the roses cling"
2113,,"And, with their fragrance, waft the notes around"
2114,,Her haunted senses.  Thirsting beyond bound
2115,,"Of her slow-yielding dreams, the lilt and swing"
2116,,"Of the mysterious delirious tune,"
2117,,"She drains like some strange opiate, with awed eyes"
2118,,"Upraised against her casement, where aswoon,"
2119,,"The stars fail from her sight, and up the skies"
2120,,Of alien azure rolls the full round moon
2121,,Like some vast bubble blown of summer noon.

2125,,
2126,,He faced his canvas (as a seer whose ken
2127,,Pierces the crust of this existence through)
2128,,And smiled beyond on that his genius knew
2129,,Ere mated with his being. Conscious then
2130,,"Of his high theme alone, he smiled again"
2131,,Straight back upon himself in many a hue
2132,,"And tint, and light and shade, which slowly grew"
2133,,"Enfeatured of a fair girl's face, as when"
2134,,First time she smiles for love's sake with no fear.
2135,,"So wrought he, witless that behind him leant"
2136,,"A woman, with old features, dim and sear,"
2137,,"And glamoured eyes that felt the brimming tear,"
2138,,"And with a voice, like some sad instrument,"
2139,,"That sighing said, ""I'm dead there; love me here!"""

2144,,The winds have talked with him confidingly;
2145,,The trees have whispered to him; and the night
2146,,"Hath held him gently as a mother might,"
2147,,And taught him all sad tones of melody:
2148,,"The mountains have bowed to him; and the sea,"
2149,,"In clamorous waves, and murmurs exquisite,"
2150,,Hath told him all her sorrow and delight--
2151,,Her legends fair-- her darkest mystery.
2152,,"His verse blooms like a flower, night and day;"
2153,,Bees cluster round his rhymes; and twitterings
2154,,"Of lark and swallow, in an endless May,"
2155,,Are mingling with the tender songs he sings--.
2156,,Nor shall he cease to sing-- in every lay
2157,,Of Nature's voice he sings-- and will alway.
