57,INTRODUCTION.,INTRODUCTION.
58,INTRODUCTION.,
59,INTRODUCTION.,As a preface in verse
60,INTRODUCTION.,Is perhaps the reverse
61,INTRODUCTION.,"Of the common and so vulgar way,"
62,INTRODUCTION.,It is thus I intend
63,INTRODUCTION.,"Introducing my friend,"
64,INTRODUCTION.,Who would fain his respects to you pay.
65,INTRODUCTION.,"Of the place of his birth,"
66,INTRODUCTION.,"Though some snug spot on earth,"
67,INTRODUCTION.,"I ne'er heard, so can't tell;"
68,INTRODUCTION.,"Though I guess that the rogue,"
69,INTRODUCTION.,"From his twang of the brogue,"
70,INTRODUCTION.,Did in Old Erin dwell.
71,INTRODUCTION.,"But if not, it was surely some queer Irishman"
72,INTRODUCTION.,Who related the tale. I've tried all that I can
73,INTRODUCTION.,"To gain further partic'lars, which p'raps might amuse,"
74,INTRODUCTION.,But I naught could fish out--ev'ry bait proved no use.
75,INTRODUCTION.,Still I'll pause to explain
76,INTRODUCTION.,"(It may p'rhaps entertain),"
77,INTRODUCTION.,How at first I acquainted became
78,INTRODUCTION.,"With the facts I relate,"
79,INTRODUCTION.,"Which, with truth I may state,"
80,INTRODUCTION.,Occurred at some long bygone date.
81,INTRODUCTION.,"You must know that I love,"
82,INTRODUCTION.,"All amusements above,"
83,INTRODUCTION.,To arise ere the sun
84,INTRODUCTION.,"Has his day's work begun,"
85,INTRODUCTION.,"And roam to some river,"
86,INTRODUCTION.,Who'll kindly deliver
87,INTRODUCTION.,Up his subjects to fate
88,INTRODUCTION.,For a little ground bait.
89,INTRODUCTION.,Oh! how often my slumbering dreams have been broke
90,INTRODUCTION.,"By the thought I'm too late, and I've suddenly woke"
91,INTRODUCTION.,"To discover 'twas dark, and have dozed off again;"
92,INTRODUCTION.,"But the dose to repeat, hope for rest being vain."
93,INTRODUCTION.,
94,INTRODUCTION.,I in fancy have fished in most curious places--
95,INTRODUCTION.,"Down a coal-hole, in areas, and off cellar bases;"
96,INTRODUCTION.,"Where the queerest of things you can name I have caught, or"
97,INTRODUCTION.,"As I dropt down my line, has retreated the water."
98,INTRODUCTION.,
99,INTRODUCTION.,"Now that angling's a passion to me appears plain,"
100,INTRODUCTION.,Which amounts to disease if a tight hold it gain;
101,INTRODUCTION.,"It may oft be relieved by right treatment, perhaps,"
102,INTRODUCTION.,"But then, sooner or later, there's sure a relapse."
103,INTRODUCTION.,"Standing out a whole day, from its dawn until night,"
104,INTRODUCTION.,"In a good drenching rain, without even a bite,"
105,INTRODUCTION.,"Is a capital thing for just cooling the brain,"
106,INTRODUCTION.,Though time still will revive--and it warms up again.
107,INTRODUCTION.,"It is contagious, too, for a brother it caught,"
108,INTRODUCTION.,As he slept in a room where my tackle was brought;
109,INTRODUCTION.,"He was up with the lark, and my top joint had broke"
110,INTRODUCTION.,"Ere the 'larum had rung, which the family woke."
111,INTRODUCTION.,
112,INTRODUCTION.,"Let me see, it is now about five years ago,"
113,INTRODUCTION.,"When, admiring the Irish and blarney,"
114,INTRODUCTION.,"I packed up all my traps, and my tackle also,"
115,INTRODUCTION.,And set sail for the banks of Killarney.
116,INTRODUCTION.,I had heard of the lovely and beautiful views
117,INTRODUCTION.,Which adorned the fair Emerald Isle;
118,INTRODUCTION.,"So as long as I'd time I resolved to roam through,"
119,INTRODUCTION.,And admire what had made Nature smile.
120,INTRODUCTION.,
121,INTRODUCTION.,"My feelings, as the sea I crossed,"
122,INTRODUCTION.,Are distant from the tale;
123,INTRODUCTION.,Suffice it that I suffered loss--
124,INTRODUCTION.,'Twas not a pleasant sail.
125,INTRODUCTION.,"My rising thoughts unable to control,"
126,INTRODUCTION.,I drowned my sorrows in the waves that roll;
127,INTRODUCTION.,"The sickly waves a tribute would demand,"
128,INTRODUCTION.,Nor gave me rest till I obeyed command.
129,INTRODUCTION.,
130,INTRODUCTION.,With much delight I traversed o'er
131,INTRODUCTION.,"The land of Pats and praties,"
132,INTRODUCTION.,And mourned to note from what I saw
133,INTRODUCTION.,That indolence their fate is.
134,INTRODUCTION.,A pipe stuck easy in their mouth
135,INTRODUCTION.,For mind and body food is;
136,INTRODUCTION.,"Their dress, I must say, is uncouth,"
137,INTRODUCTION.,For it next door to nude is....
138,INTRODUCTION.,"I'm speaking of the lower sort,"
139,INTRODUCTION.,Not so bad are their betters;
140,INTRODUCTION.,"Though some, who wealth find ready wrought,"
141,INTRODUCTION.,Rest in luxurious fetters.
142,INTRODUCTION.,And have they been for ever so?
143,INTRODUCTION.,"Industrious, were they never?"
144,INTRODUCTION.,"Some things I've seen would p'rhaps say, ""No,"
145,INTRODUCTION.,"As now they were not ever."""
146,INTRODUCTION.,"But think not, reader, I intend"
147,INTRODUCTION.,To write on why and wherefore;
148,INTRODUCTION.,"I know not what these folks will mend,"
149,INTRODUCTION.,So cannot tell you therefore.
150,INTRODUCTION.,(Though industry in some to plant
151,INTRODUCTION.,"I tried, and put in training;"
152,INTRODUCTION.,"But soon they cried, ""O mend-i-cant!""--"
153,INTRODUCTION.,So beggars are remaining.)
154,INTRODUCTION.,Nor is it now my wish to write
155,INTRODUCTION.,On Ireland's beauteous scenery;
156,INTRODUCTION.,"Though filled with rapture and delight,"
157,INTRODUCTION.,I'll spare you what I've seen; or I
158,INTRODUCTION.,"Might fill a dozen pages quite,"
159,INTRODUCTION.,Describing lakes and greenery.
160,INTRODUCTION.,"No; such is not my present plan,"
161,INTRODUCTION.,On angling turns my story:
162,INTRODUCTION.,The pleasures of a fisherman
163,INTRODUCTION.,I soon shall lay before ye.
164,INTRODUCTION.,"By some mishap at Hull or Cork,"
165,INTRODUCTION.,My tackle was mislaid;
166,INTRODUCTION.,"So fate did inclination baulk,"
167,INTRODUCTION.,And sport some days delayed.
168,INTRODUCTION.,"I just had purchased, all quite new,"
169,INTRODUCTION.,Of flies a complete set;
170,INTRODUCTION.,"And though I had my rod, 'tis true,"
171,INTRODUCTION.,I would not fresh ones get.
172,INTRODUCTION.,"I'll wait, thinks I, and roam about,"
173,INTRODUCTION.,Though some days it may cost.
174,INTRODUCTION.,"I'll find the lucky places out,"
175,INTRODUCTION.,So time will not be lost.
176,INTRODUCTION.,"By telegraph's electric wire,"
177,INTRODUCTION.,"Or steam, I'll let them know"
178,INTRODUCTION.,The place to which I'd fain desire
179,INTRODUCTION.,These luckless flies should go.
180,INTRODUCTION.,
181,INTRODUCTION.,'Twas on a morn as bright as fair
182,INTRODUCTION.,"As any time, or anywhere,"
183,INTRODUCTION.,Mine eyes have ever seen;
184,INTRODUCTION.,"For bright and cloudless was the sky,"
185,INTRODUCTION.,"And blue as any maiden's eye,"
186,INTRODUCTION.,Where tears have seldom been.
187,INTRODUCTION.,It made my heart with pleasure beat;
188,INTRODUCTION.,"A lightness seemed to raise my feet,"
189,INTRODUCTION.,"And bear them forth to roam,"
190,INTRODUCTION.,"Ere yet the morning meal was laid,"
191,INTRODUCTION.,To ramble down a mossy glade
192,INTRODUCTION.,Some many miles from home.
193,INTRODUCTION.,"Then climbed I up a dew-bathed steep,"
194,INTRODUCTION.,Just on the other side to peep
195,INTRODUCTION.,And see what might be there.
196,INTRODUCTION.,"By tangled branches grasped right close,"
197,INTRODUCTION.,"Above impediments I rose,"
198,INTRODUCTION.,"And, lo, a valley fair!"
199,INTRODUCTION.,"Where, 'midst the shade of drooping trees,"
200,INTRODUCTION.,"All quiv'ring in the morning breeze,"
201,INTRODUCTION.,"Appeared a glitt'ring stream,"
202,INTRODUCTION.,"Which ran for miles, than gold more bright;"
203,INTRODUCTION.,"Refulgent with the source of light,"
204,INTRODUCTION.,The waves like diamonds gleam.
205,INTRODUCTION.,"Impelled I rushed like some wild deer,"
206,INTRODUCTION.,"And bounding o'er each bramble near,"
207,INTRODUCTION.,"Like torrent's fearful course,"
208,INTRODUCTION.,Was forced to run a whole field's length
209,INTRODUCTION.,Before expended was the strength
210,INTRODUCTION.,Of gravitation's force.
211,INTRODUCTION.,
212,INTRODUCTION.,"When at the water's side, I found"
213,INTRODUCTION.,"An aged man, who gazed around"
214,INTRODUCTION.,"Half terrified, to see"
215,INTRODUCTION.,"If some mad bull approached that way,"
216,INTRODUCTION.,Or steam-engine had gone astray;
217,INTRODUCTION.,And stared surprised at me.
218,INTRODUCTION.,"I bowed to him, and begged, polite,"
219,INTRODUCTION.,His pardon for the sudden fright
220,INTRODUCTION.,"Which I, unconscious, gave."
221,INTRODUCTION.,"""It was the beauteous scene which made"
222,INTRODUCTION.,"Me scamper down so wild,"" I said;"
223,INTRODUCTION.,"""For which I pardon crave."
224,INTRODUCTION.,"For, like yourself, I love the sport,"
225,INTRODUCTION.,And 'twas this sparkling stream which brought
226,INTRODUCTION.,Out hitherward my feet.
227,INTRODUCTION.,"What numbers, sir! what splendid trout!"
228,INTRODUCTION.,You must have early sallied out:
229,INTRODUCTION.,"Such sport I seldom meet!"""
230,INTRODUCTION.,"""A stranger, then, you are,"" said he;"
231,INTRODUCTION.,"""The fishes here bite mostly free,"
232,INTRODUCTION.,They love the gaudy fly.
233,INTRODUCTION.,"But scarce an hour I here have been,"
234,INTRODUCTION.,And hooked the few that you have seen
235,INTRODUCTION.,"For breakfast. By the bye,"
236,INTRODUCTION.,I very nearly had forgot
237,INTRODUCTION.,"That time for me will tarry not,"
238,INTRODUCTION.,That hour is drawing nigh.
239,INTRODUCTION.,"But, sir, with pleasure, if you love"
240,INTRODUCTION.,"The sport, I'll show you where they rove,"
241,INTRODUCTION.,For often here am I;
242,INTRODUCTION.,"And every nook and hole I know,"
243,INTRODUCTION.,Which any time you please I'll show:
244,INTRODUCTION.,"My house you yonder spy."""
245,INTRODUCTION.,"I, thanking, praised the old man's skill,"
246,INTRODUCTION.,"Though, as I viewed him nearer still,"
247,INTRODUCTION.,I deemed him younger far
248,INTRODUCTION.,Than I at first beholding thought;
249,INTRODUCTION.,"'Twas care, not age, had deeply wrought"
250,INTRODUCTION.,The wrinkle-furrowed scar.
251,INTRODUCTION.,"But though erect as poplar straight,"
252,INTRODUCTION.,He bent not 'neath the crushing weight
253,INTRODUCTION.,Of Time's remorseless might.
254,INTRODUCTION.,"Yet few and scanty were his locks,"
255,INTRODUCTION.,Which were than Shetland's rill-bathed flocks
256,INTRODUCTION.,Longer and purer white.
257,INTRODUCTION.,"A sudden int'rest in mine eyes,"
258,INTRODUCTION.,Which unaccounted will arise
259,INTRODUCTION.,"Ofttimes within the brain,"
260,INTRODUCTION.,"I felt tow'rds him, and longed to know"
261,INTRODUCTION.,What circumstance had made him so--
262,INTRODUCTION.,"If grief, or wearing pain."
263,INTRODUCTION.,"He friendly seemed, and not averse"
264,INTRODUCTION.,On fishing topics to converse;
265,INTRODUCTION.,"At length I told my woe,"
266,INTRODUCTION.,How that my flies and lines behind
267,INTRODUCTION.,"Were left. Said he, ""Oh, never mind;"
268,INTRODUCTION.,"If home with me you'll go,"
269,INTRODUCTION.,With pleasure I will lend you all
270,INTRODUCTION.,You want; my stock's by no means small--
271,INTRODUCTION.,Not very modern though.
272,INTRODUCTION.,"And, p'rhaps, if I, a stranger, may"
273,INTRODUCTION.,"Request a boon, as such a way"
274,INTRODUCTION.,"From home you've rambled out,"
275,INTRODUCTION.,I should feel overjoyed if you
276,INTRODUCTION.,Would stay and let your palate too
277,INTRODUCTION.,Be tickled by my trout.
278,INTRODUCTION.,"Except my housekeeper there's none,"
279,INTRODUCTION.,"And she will pardon what I've done,"
280,INTRODUCTION.,"So pray do not refuse."""
281,INTRODUCTION.,"I, pondering for a moment, thought,"
282,INTRODUCTION.,When he a fresh inducement brought
283,INTRODUCTION.,Which drowned my frail excuse.
284,INTRODUCTION.,"""And afterwards I'll take you out"
285,INTRODUCTION.,Where you may catch as fine a trout
286,INTRODUCTION.,"As ever bit at hook."""
287,INTRODUCTION.,"And, truly, I sharp hunger felt,"
288,INTRODUCTION.,And as three miles from where I dwelt
289,INTRODUCTION.,"I was, I gladly took"
290,INTRODUCTION.,"Him at his word, and pleased him quite"
291,INTRODUCTION.,By thus accepting his invite.
292,INTRODUCTION.,"He seized my hand and twice it shook,"
293,INTRODUCTION.,"And thanking me with cordial look,"
294,INTRODUCTION.,"He smiling said, ""For you I feel"
295,INTRODUCTION.,"A friendship, sir, I'll not conceal."
296,INTRODUCTION.,You cause my fancies back to fly
297,INTRODUCTION.,"To youth's bright days, when fearless I,"
298,INTRODUCTION.,"Like you, would dash through passes where"
299,INTRODUCTION.,A slip had sent me past all care;
300,INTRODUCTION.,But now those joyous moments seem
301,INTRODUCTION.,"Like wanderings in a pleasant dream,"
302,INTRODUCTION.,"And never will return, I fear."
303,INTRODUCTION.,"But, see, my garden-gate is here."""
304,INTRODUCTION.,"He led the way, with fish in hand;"
305,INTRODUCTION.,"We neared the house, perhaps not grand"
306,INTRODUCTION.,"In point of size, yet truly there"
307,INTRODUCTION.,"Resided Elegance, and Care"
308,INTRODUCTION.,Expended on each part had been:
309,INTRODUCTION.,"No imperfections could be seen,"
310,INTRODUCTION.,"For Order reigned throughout the place,"
311,INTRODUCTION.,Assisted by her sister Grace.
312,INTRODUCTION.,"The walls were built of reddish brick,"
313,INTRODUCTION.,"And massive as a house were thick,"
314,INTRODUCTION.,"That meant to combat with old Time,"
315,INTRODUCTION.,For still they seemed now in their prime.
316,INTRODUCTION.,Though cent'ries two past them had strayed
317,INTRODUCTION.,They scarce had an impression made.
318,INTRODUCTION.,A carved verandah ran before
319,INTRODUCTION.,"The front, and arched above the door"
320,INTRODUCTION.,"Arose, where flowers twined around"
321,INTRODUCTION.,"Their sweetness, and a dwelling found."
322,INTRODUCTION.,"""We're rather homely folks,"" said he,"
323,INTRODUCTION.,"""My housekeeper and I: we see"
324,INTRODUCTION.,And hear but little of the news
325,INTRODUCTION.,"And fashions which you moderns use,"
326,INTRODUCTION.,But sure I am you will excuse
327,INTRODUCTION.,"Our queerness, which may chance amuse."""
328,INTRODUCTION.,"With this we reached the hall, whose floor"
329,INTRODUCTION.,"Was paved with stone. He moved before,"
330,INTRODUCTION.,"And throwing wide an open door,"
331,INTRODUCTION.,He bade me enter and wage war
332,INTRODUCTION.,"With hunger a few moments more,"
333,INTRODUCTION.,The while he after the fishes saw.
334,INTRODUCTION.,
335,INTRODUCTION.,"The house was large, and opened out"
336,INTRODUCTION.,"Upon a lawn, where roamed about"
337,INTRODUCTION.,"A gentle fawn, who darted through"
338,INTRODUCTION.,"The casement, but as quick withdrew,--"
339,INTRODUCTION.,"He missed the hand that used to feed,"
340,INTRODUCTION.,So backward flew with rapid speed.
341,INTRODUCTION.,
342,INTRODUCTION.,"The floor of polished oak was made,"
343,INTRODUCTION.,O'er which a carpet rich was laid.
344,INTRODUCTION.,The furniture was carved antique;
345,INTRODUCTION.,"And had it been allowed to speak,"
346,INTRODUCTION.,Might tales of stirring int'rest tell
347,INTRODUCTION.,Of what in ancient times befell:
348,INTRODUCTION.,But that which most attracted me
349,INTRODUCTION.,"Seemed younger far than all to be,"
350,INTRODUCTION.,The portrait of a lady fair
351,INTRODUCTION.,"As ever breathed the vital air,"
352,INTRODUCTION.,"Or drove a lover to despair,"
353,INTRODUCTION.,Or claimed in any mischief share;--
354,INTRODUCTION.,As beautiful a face was there
355,INTRODUCTION.,As poet's quill did e'er compare
356,INTRODUCTION.,With aught above the earth that grows;
357,INTRODUCTION.,"Than even winter's drifting snows,"
358,INTRODUCTION.,"Her neck was white, while dark her eyes"
359,INTRODUCTION.,As night when moonbeams shun the skies;
360,INTRODUCTION.,"Her glossy locks down trickling,"
361,INTRODUCTION.,"Were blacker than the raven's wing,"
362,INTRODUCTION.,"While fresh-born pearls might even die with grief,"
363,INTRODUCTION.,Out-rivalled by her more transparent teeth.
364,INTRODUCTION.,"The rosy, tint-like blushes on her cheek,"
365,INTRODUCTION.,"Would puzzle Language, if he truth must speak."
366,INTRODUCTION.,"In fact, I saw the portrait was not real,--"
367,INTRODUCTION.,"A painter's fancy, beautiful, ideal."
368,INTRODUCTION.,"Yet still, enraptured, in a pensive mood,"
369,INTRODUCTION.,"Entranced I gazed, more pleased the more I viewed,"
370,INTRODUCTION.,"When, unperceived, beside me stood my host,"
371,INTRODUCTION.,Who like myself in wand'ring thought seemed lost.
372,INTRODUCTION.,"He sighed; I turned, and on his cheek beheld"
373,INTRODUCTION.,A falling tear his mem'ry's grief impelled:
374,INTRODUCTION.,"But soon above it rose a cheerful smile,"
375,INTRODUCTION.,And Joy seemed anxious Sorrow to beguile.
376,INTRODUCTION.,"""What form! what grace!"" half questioning, said I,"
377,INTRODUCTION.,"""No mortal face such beauty could supply?"""
378,INTRODUCTION.,"""But yet a fairer one I've seen,"" said he."
379,INTRODUCTION.,"""Then surely she th' original must be?"""
380,INTRODUCTION.,"""Not her, I mean; the grave has closed above"
381,INTRODUCTION.,"That beauteous form, which seeing was to love:"
382,INTRODUCTION.,"My housekeeper I meant,--you smile!"" said he,"
383,INTRODUCTION.,"""I own that I may not impartial be;"
384,INTRODUCTION.,"But still I hope you will not seek her heart,"
385,INTRODUCTION.,For it would kill me were we forced to part:
386,INTRODUCTION.,"Come, promise me you will not fall in love,"""
387,INTRODUCTION.,"He joking said, and cast his eyes above."
388,INTRODUCTION.,"I gave my word, though really I must own"
389,INTRODUCTION.,"On first beholding I was near o'erthrown,"
390,INTRODUCTION.,"And nigh had fallen into Cupid's snare,"
391,INTRODUCTION.,For such a sight I did but half prepare.
392,INTRODUCTION.,"A step approached, he left that toe to seek,"
393,INTRODUCTION.,"A smacking kiss salutes his aged cheek,"
394,INTRODUCTION.,"Then, whisp'ring low of me, I heard them speak,"
395,INTRODUCTION.,And felt uncertain what I ought to do.
396,INTRODUCTION.,When not long after they both entered through
397,INTRODUCTION.,The half-closed door my back was turned unto.
398,INTRODUCTION.,"""His housekeeper,"" thinks I: ""I'll not look round"
399,INTRODUCTION.,"Until he speak, but seem in thought profound,"
400,INTRODUCTION.,"Still gazing on that face for charms renowned."""
401,INTRODUCTION.,"""My niece, my friend."" I introduced am now,"
402,INTRODUCTION.,"And so, perforce, must turn me round and bow."
403,INTRODUCTION.,"When, like Miss Lalla Rookh,"
404,INTRODUCTION.,In Moore's delightful book
405,INTRODUCTION.,"(Who found her husband was Young What's-his-name),"
406,INTRODUCTION.,I with amazement found
407,INTRODUCTION.,(When I had gazed around)
408,INTRODUCTION.,The housekeeper and portrait were the same.
409,INTRODUCTION.,"The night-dark orbs, which radiant smiles bedeck"
410,INTRODUCTION.,"(Like sunbeams dancing on the ruffled wave),"
411,INTRODUCTION.,"The pearly teeth, the snowy, swan-like neck,"
412,INTRODUCTION.,"The roseate hue which health unsparing gave,"
413,INTRODUCTION.,"The velvet cheek, and deepened on the lips"
414,INTRODUCTION.,(Like double poppies whence the wise bee sips
415,INTRODUCTION.,"Entrancing sweets), and ev'ry other charm"
416,INTRODUCTION.,"That tongue has told, or fancy could describe,"
417,INTRODUCTION.,"In both appeared--yea, which had won the palm"
418,INTRODUCTION.,In beauty's flower-show (without a bribe)
419,INTRODUCTION.,"I cannot tell, but let the living form"
420,INTRODUCTION.,"But speak a word, and ev'ry doubt is gone."
421,INTRODUCTION.,
422,INTRODUCTION.,"His niece, he said; his sister's child is she?"
423,INTRODUCTION.,No wonder then their faces well agree.
424,INTRODUCTION.,"But still I gave him a reproving look,"
425,INTRODUCTION.,"At which he smiled, while in his arm he took"
426,INTRODUCTION.,"The portrait's twin, and bid me follow where"
427,INTRODUCTION.,The well-dressed trout for our repast prepare.
428,INTRODUCTION.,
429,INTRODUCTION.,"The meal concluded, out we went"
430,INTRODUCTION.,"With tackle which he kindly lent,"
431,INTRODUCTION.,"And reached a lonely spot,"
432,INTRODUCTION.,"Where, at the swarms of glittering flies,"
433,INTRODUCTION.,"The speckled trout enraptured rise,"
434,INTRODUCTION.,"Like lightning, or a shot;"
435,INTRODUCTION.,"And soon a splendid pair I caught,"
436,INTRODUCTION.,"As fine as I had seen, methought,"
437,INTRODUCTION.,Though I've tried lots of places.
438,INTRODUCTION.,"He calls: ""What luck, my friend?"" says he."
439,INTRODUCTION.,"""A brace!"" ""The same have favoured me--"
440,INTRODUCTION.,So that's a pair of braces;
441,INTRODUCTION.,And if the sun will but lie hid
442,INTRODUCTION.,"The fleecy, flutt'ring clouds amid,"
443,INTRODUCTION.,For two short hours more
444,INTRODUCTION.,"(Unless your arm be wearied out),"
445,INTRODUCTION.,"We'll line the bank with sparkling trout,"
446,INTRODUCTION.,"In number twice a score."""
447,INTRODUCTION.,
448,INTRODUCTION.,"I said before, I anxious felt to learn"
449,INTRODUCTION.,"The old man's history,"
450,INTRODUCTION.,There seemed some mystery;
451,INTRODUCTION.,"For he from grave to gay, and back, would turn"
452,INTRODUCTION.,"So very fast,"
453,INTRODUCTION.,That scarcely past
454,INTRODUCTION.,"The witty jest had flown, before a sigh"
455,INTRODUCTION.,"Burst forth, and buried deep he long would lie"
456,INTRODUCTION.,In thought;
457,INTRODUCTION.,And nought
458,INTRODUCTION.,"Would rouse him up, till some one near him spoke,"
459,INTRODUCTION.,And then some anecdote or lively joke
460,INTRODUCTION.,Appeared the offspring of his lethargy.
461,INTRODUCTION.,
462,INTRODUCTION.,"In vain the fish, with wistful eye,"
463,INTRODUCTION.,"Might long to seize his tempting fly,"
464,INTRODUCTION.,For rod and line unheeded lie
465,INTRODUCTION.,Quite harmless on the shore.--
466,INTRODUCTION.,"At breakfast also, by the bye,"
467,INTRODUCTION.,"The trout got cold, or very nigh,"
468,INTRODUCTION.,Before he asked if I would try
469,INTRODUCTION.,Another mouthful more.
470,INTRODUCTION.,
471,INTRODUCTION.,"I asked his name, and, as I thought,"
472,INTRODUCTION.,My voice him to remembrance brought;

750,INTRODUCTION.,"He asked, at length, if I much diff'rence found"

768,INTRODUCTION.,But though I learnt the broken limb to bind
769,INTRODUCTION.,I found no ease for my distracted mind.
770,INTRODUCTION.,"But much too long upon these scenes I dwell,"
771,INTRODUCTION.,"Excuse me, sir, for ev'ry word I tell"

779,INTRODUCTION.,But greatly had Rosina changed since I
780,INTRODUCTION.,"In sadness wished her that last, long good-bye."
781,INTRODUCTION.,The bounding step I loved so much to greet
782,INTRODUCTION.,"Was stately now, while for those kisses sweet"
783,INTRODUCTION.,(Which would such rapture in my bosom wake)
784,INTRODUCTION.,She proffered me her tiny hand to shake.
785,INTRODUCTION.,"I rather disappointed felt, I own,"
786,INTRODUCTION.,"To find the girl to womanhood had grown,"
787,INTRODUCTION.,But yet I would not any charm displace;
788,INTRODUCTION.,"For each she wore with such bewitching grace,"
789,INTRODUCTION.,That soon I liked her gentleness far more
790,INTRODUCTION.,Than e'en the lively mirth I loved before.
791,INTRODUCTION.,
792,INTRODUCTION.,But though her timid manner fled away
793,INTRODUCTION.,"(Like mist at morning 'fore the sunny ray),"
794,INTRODUCTION.,"My suit, alas! progressed but little way,"
795,INTRODUCTION.,For diffidence my lips would ever seal
796,INTRODUCTION.,When most I wished my passion to reveal;

798,INTRODUCTION.,My trembling voice grew dumb and never spoke.
799,INTRODUCTION.,A hint I from my guardian too received.

811,INTRODUCTION.,
812,INTRODUCTION.,"""Time crept--I toiled in spite of failing strength,"
813,INTRODUCTION.,And through th' examination passed at length
814,INTRODUCTION.,"With honours crowned, when as my health waxed low,"
815,INTRODUCTION.,I homeward wished for some few weeks to go.
816,INTRODUCTION.,"I fixed the day, but did not let them know,"
817,INTRODUCTION.,That unexpected I myself might show.
818,INTRODUCTION.,But on the morn at eve of starting came
819,INTRODUCTION.,"A letter, signed with her loved mother's name;"
820,INTRODUCTION.,Which told my heart how vainly passion raged--
821,INTRODUCTION.,Rosina to another was engaged.
822,INTRODUCTION.,"What then took place I've scarcely power to say,"
823,INTRODUCTION.,"For sense and reason nearly broke away,"
824,INTRODUCTION.,While I had surely cleft the foaming sea
825,INTRODUCTION.,Had not my man rushed forth and hindered me;
826,INTRODUCTION.,"For all that night, in spite of wind and rain,"
827,INTRODUCTION.,I paced the deck to cool my burning brain.
828,INTRODUCTION.,But ere again the vessel touched the land
829,INTRODUCTION.,"I calmer grew, and gained my self-command;"
830,INTRODUCTION.,And gave him orders never to make known
831,INTRODUCTION.,The great excitement I had lately shown.
832,INTRODUCTION.,
833,INTRODUCTION.,"""Arrived at home I entered quietly,"
834,INTRODUCTION.,And found my uncle in deep reverie;
835,INTRODUCTION.,So much absorbed he did not notice me.
836,INTRODUCTION.,"I sat me down. 'Poor fellow!' muttered he,"
837,INTRODUCTION.,'This is indeed an unexpected blow--

840,INTRODUCTION.,O that I could his wounded spirit cheer!'
841,INTRODUCTION.,"'Uncle,' I rising said, 'behold, I'm here!'"
842,INTRODUCTION.,"He started, grasped my hand, while swift a tear,"
843,INTRODUCTION.,"Pursued by others, bounded off his cheek;"
844,INTRODUCTION.,His swelling heart appeared too full to speak.
845,INTRODUCTION.,"But soon recov'ring from the first surprise,"
846,INTRODUCTION.,To calm my grief he unavailing tries;
847,INTRODUCTION.,"(For age and youth behold with diff'ring eyes,"
848,INTRODUCTION.,And one as well a vessel might advise
849,INTRODUCTION.,"Straight on unmoved its chart-drawn course to keep,"
850,INTRODUCTION.,"When fiercely battling with the raging deep,"
851,INTRODUCTION.,"As tell a youthful heart, by anguish torn,"
852,INTRODUCTION.,"To calm its poignant grief, and cease to mourn.)"
853,INTRODUCTION.,
854,INTRODUCTION.,"""I struggled hard but long could not sustain,"
855,INTRODUCTION.,For cold and fever seized my care-worn brain;
856,INTRODUCTION.,"My health, by over-study much impaired,"
857,INTRODUCTION.,For this encounter was but ill prepared.
858,INTRODUCTION.,"For weeks unconscious in this state I lay,"
859,INTRODUCTION.,"My life, despaired of, nearly sank away;"
860,INTRODUCTION.,"Until sweet Hope appeared with healing beam,"
861,INTRODUCTION.,And I awoke as from a pleasant dream.
862,INTRODUCTION.,"I dreamt my love had watched my bed beside,"
863,INTRODUCTION.,And nursed me till within her arms I died.
864,INTRODUCTION.,A step approached--oh! could that form be she?
865,INTRODUCTION.,I closed my eyes and slumb'ring seemed to be;
866,INTRODUCTION.,What would I not have given then to tell!
867,INTRODUCTION.,"But yet I would not, dared not, break the spell."
868,INTRODUCTION.,"'Have I been wise?' a voice beside me said,"
869,INTRODUCTION.,And gently smoothed the pillow 'neath my head;
870,INTRODUCTION.,"'Have I done right, in giving thus away"
871,INTRODUCTION.,The heart he deemed was his until that day?
872,INTRODUCTION.,"Oh, cruel fate! my love I must forsake,"
873,INTRODUCTION.,Or else the heart that loved so true will break.
874,INTRODUCTION.,"This I'll resolve, if he to health revives,"
875,INTRODUCTION.,"And for my hand again as suitor strives,"
876,INTRODUCTION.,"I'll fancy that we were betrothed before,"
877,INTRODUCTION.,And try to love him as we loved of yore.'
878,INTRODUCTION.,What joy! what bliss! what rapture! filled my heart.
879,INTRODUCTION.,"'One word, and I from her shall never part."
880,INTRODUCTION.,"But oh! she loves another one,' thought I"
881,INTRODUCTION.,"(And fell Despair and Grief again drew nigh),"
882,INTRODUCTION.,"'Who may more worthy be, though I deny"
883,INTRODUCTION.,"That he can love more true, more ardently."
884,INTRODUCTION.,"Still can my heart accept this sacrifice,"
885,INTRODUCTION.,Which duty forced her spirit to devise?
886,INTRODUCTION.,Should selfish feelings have sufficient weight
887,INTRODUCTION.,To wish two hearts betrothed to separate?
888,INTRODUCTION.,"No, I would rather lonely, ling'ring, die,"
889,INTRODUCTION.,Than thus my peace with so much suff'ring buy.'
890,INTRODUCTION.,"A shiv'ring seized me, and I heard her rise;"
891,INTRODUCTION.,Yet closely clenched I sealed my quiv'ring eyes;
892,INTRODUCTION.,"While on my cheek I felt her warm, sweet breath--"
893,INTRODUCTION.,"Oh, 'twas a struggle fierce as life with death!"
894,INTRODUCTION.,"For, weaker grown, I scarcely could restrain"
895,INTRODUCTION.,The varied feelings battling in my brain;
896,INTRODUCTION.,"For Hope, Fear, Justice, in succession reigned,"
897,INTRODUCTION.,Until Delirium conquered all again.
898,INTRODUCTION.,"Then trembling Life o'erpower'd seemed to have fled,"
899,INTRODUCTION.,And with a piercing scream she told them I was dead.
900,INTRODUCTION.,
901,INTRODUCTION.,"""But health and strength returning, by degrees"
902,INTRODUCTION.,Brought to my mind that long-lost stranger Ease;
903,INTRODUCTION.,But weeks and weeks passed silently before
904,INTRODUCTION.,I dared request to see her face once more.
905,INTRODUCTION.,"The youth she loved then entered by her side,"
906,INTRODUCTION.,And on the morrow she became his bride.
907,INTRODUCTION.,
908,INTRODUCTION.,"""An officer for India bound was he,"
909,INTRODUCTION.,"And with her mother soon they crossed the sea,"
910,INTRODUCTION.,While I roamed o'er the Continent to find
911,INTRODUCTION.,Relief and comfort for my restless mind.
912,INTRODUCTION.,But scarcely past a twelvemonth spent at Rome
913,INTRODUCTION.,Ere mournful tidings summoned me back home.
914,INTRODUCTION.,"My worthy uncle had died suddenly,"
915,INTRODUCTION.,And made me heir to all his property.
916,INTRODUCTION.,
917,INTRODUCTION.,"""But what is treasure but a gilded toy?"
918,INTRODUCTION.,The wounded spirit never can enjoy
919,INTRODUCTION.,"Its hollow pomp, which ne'er can satisfy"
920,INTRODUCTION.,The craving heart (where hope bloomed but to die).
921,INTRODUCTION.,"Yes, ev'ry tie which bound to earth had flown,"
922,INTRODUCTION.,And I seemed left forsaken and alone;
923,INTRODUCTION.,The guiding star which cheered me with its light
924,INTRODUCTION.,"Had, sinking, left me overwhelmed with night."
925,INTRODUCTION.,"Years past, but still my feelings were the same,"
926,INTRODUCTION.,"When melancholy news from India came,--"
927,INTRODUCTION.,"The youthful husband in the war was slain,"
928,INTRODUCTION.,"(Her mother long time in the grave had lain,)"
929,INTRODUCTION.,"And poor Rosina, worn with care and grief,"
930,INTRODUCTION.,In childhood's scenes resolved to seek relief:
931,INTRODUCTION.,"But deep disease was rooted in her breast,"
932,INTRODUCTION.,And soon her gentle spirit sank to rest.

955,INTRODUCTION.,"Of touching sweetness, charmed th' enraptured ear,"
956,INTRODUCTION.,So soft and plaintive like the whisp'rings near

964,INTRODUCTION.,Can there read through
965,INTRODUCTION.,What really I believe is true;
966,INTRODUCTION.,"For ruins near,"
967,INTRODUCTION.,"As proofs appear,"

969,INTRODUCTION.,And I the name of Mary found
970,INTRODUCTION.,"Carved on a stone from underground,"
971,INTRODUCTION.,While in the family for years
972,INTRODUCTION.,The tale has been; and it appears
973,INTRODUCTION.,"My grandfather searched o'er the place,"
974,INTRODUCTION.,"And ev'ry record he could trace,"
975,INTRODUCTION.,"Who said, from all he'd seen and knew,"
976,INTRODUCTION.,The legend without doubt was true.

978,INTRODUCTION.,"From folks who never, on my word,"
979,INTRODUCTION.,"Have seen the tale, or could have guessed"
980,INTRODUCTION.,That I the manuscript possessed.
981,INTRODUCTION.,"The river, too, in which to-day"
982,INTRODUCTION.,"We fished, through forests wends its way,"
983,INTRODUCTION.,And many (if you so desire)
984,INTRODUCTION.,Can show you where our worthy friar
985,INTRODUCTION.,"In vain his basket tried to fill,"
986,INTRODUCTION.,Not from the want of fish but skill;
987,INTRODUCTION.,Which place since then has haunted been;

998,INTRODUCTION.,"The tale; but read, and I will show"
999,INTRODUCTION.,"You where it is, that you may go"
1000,INTRODUCTION.,('Tis best upon a drizzling night)

1002,INTRODUCTION.,
1003,INTRODUCTION.,"I rose to leave,--it was a splendid night,"
1004,INTRODUCTION.,"The rising moon shone beautifully bright,"
1005,INTRODUCTION.,"And pleased I dwelt upon my homeward walk,"
1006,INTRODUCTION.,Which formed the subject of our passing talk;
1007,INTRODUCTION.,But as we parted at the garden-gate
1008,INTRODUCTION.,"A groom appearing said, ""The horses wait."""
1009,INTRODUCTION.,"My thoughtful host this pleasure had supplied,"
1010,INTRODUCTION.,And greatly I enjoyed the moonlight ride.
1011,INTRODUCTION.,This may indeed (thought I) a sample be
1012,INTRODUCTION.,Of Ireland's pleasing hospitality.
1013,INTRODUCTION.,
1014,INTRODUCTION.,Ere seeking rest I thought to read
1015,INTRODUCTION.,"The tale, but found that much indeed"
1016,INTRODUCTION.,"Of time and patience it would need,"
1017,INTRODUCTION.,Before its pages could defy
1018,INTRODUCTION.,"The watchful critic's piercing eye,"
1019,INTRODUCTION.,Which seeks and points out ev'ry flaw;
1020,INTRODUCTION.,"(Like landladies, when we withdraw"

1023,INTRODUCTION.,Which ev'ry lodger ev'ry year
1024,INTRODUCTION.,"Has paid them for, and paid too, dear.)"
1025,INTRODUCTION.,"In fact, so much had been destroyed"
1026,INTRODUCTION.,"That really I felt quite annoyed,"
1027,INTRODUCTION.,And feared I never could restore
1028,INTRODUCTION.,And make it perfect as before.
1029,INTRODUCTION.,"But, quite resolved to do my best,"
1030,INTRODUCTION.,"I gave my quill but little rest,"
1031,INTRODUCTION.,And sketched the outlines in a week;
1032,INTRODUCTION.,"When, as I wished with him to speak"
1033,INTRODUCTION.,"About some parts, I roamed across"
1034,INTRODUCTION.,"And found him,--not at home, of course,"
1035,INTRODUCTION.,Yet waited I quite patiently
1036,INTRODUCTION.,"(Although some time he p'rhaps might be),"
1037,INTRODUCTION.,And rambled o'er the garden wide
1038,INTRODUCTION.,With fair Rosina by my side.
1039,INTRODUCTION.,
1040,INTRODUCTION.,"At length he came, and truly he"

1049,INTRODUCTION.,"To print it for them to peruse?"""
1050,INTRODUCTION.,"""Well, really, I can't tell,"" said I;"
1051,INTRODUCTION.,"""If it were mine I think I'd try:"
1052,INTRODUCTION.,But many parts must altered be
1053,INTRODUCTION.,Before it will from faults be free.
1054,INTRODUCTION.,The satires on the lovely sex
1055,INTRODUCTION.,Some gentle heart will surely vex;
1056,INTRODUCTION.,You ought to rather soften down

1058,INTRODUCTION.,"""Not so,"" said he; ""'tis only those"
1059,INTRODUCTION.,"Whom the dress fits will wear the clothes,"

1064,INTRODUCTION.,
1065,INTRODUCTION.,"""Then, sir, I would curtail that scene"
1066,INTRODUCTION.,In which the Friar feigns a dream;
1067,INTRODUCTION.,"The tale he tells is much too long,"
1068,INTRODUCTION.,"And critics will pronounce it wrong,--"
1069,INTRODUCTION.,Too perfect it appears to me
1070,INTRODUCTION.,"For an impromptu fib to be."""
1071,INTRODUCTION.,"""That's exactly the point, my good fellow,"" he said;"
1072,INTRODUCTION.,"""It was Fiction who stuffed all those lies in his head."
1073,INTRODUCTION.,"He the fair muse invoked, so she had (I don't doubt it)"

1075,INTRODUCTION.,"I made other remarks, but each frailty he proved"
1076,INTRODUCTION.,"To be rather a beauty, so none were removed."
1077,INTRODUCTION.,"And, kind reader, I'll beg you to keep this in mind,"
1078,INTRODUCTION.,"If with aught in the legend you wish fault to find,"
1079,INTRODUCTION.,"That each blemish or bull's in the manuscript line,"
1080,INTRODUCTION.,While the prettiest bits are undoubtedly mine.
1081,INTRODUCTION.,
1082,INTRODUCTION.,But though he and Rosina took
1083,INTRODUCTION.,Me out one morn to have a look
1084,INTRODUCTION.,"At what is called the Friar's Nook,"
1085,INTRODUCTION.,And we together rambled o'er
1086,INTRODUCTION.,"The moulding ruins to explore,"
1087,INTRODUCTION.,Where I the name of Mary saw
1088,INTRODUCTION.,"(Or what a tombstone seemed to me),"
1089,INTRODUCTION.,I yet could never plainly see
1090,INTRODUCTION.,Why these should proofs conclusive be
1091,INTRODUCTION.,That Peter had resided here;
1092,INTRODUCTION.,"But as it seemed to him so clear,"
1093,INTRODUCTION.,"I would not breathe a contradiction,"
1094,INTRODUCTION.,"But thought, Then truth's more strange than fiction."
1095,INTRODUCTION.,"But now the tale itself we'll read,"
1096,INTRODUCTION.,"I have delayed you long, indeed;"
1097,INTRODUCTION.,But what is life? to most a plain
1098,INTRODUCTION.,In which men roam in search of gain;
1099,INTRODUCTION.,"They build, they plant, they heap up store,"
1100,INTRODUCTION.,"They work, they toil, they strive for more,"
1101,INTRODUCTION.,Nor joys nor comforts will desire:
1102,INTRODUCTION.,"Their wish, they say, is to retire,"
1103,INTRODUCTION.,But when they would their wealth enjoy
1104,INTRODUCTION.,They find that every sweet will cloy.
1105,INTRODUCTION.,"Now, though your patience, reader, 's vast,"
1106,INTRODUCTION.,"In hopes to reach the tale at last,"
1107,INTRODUCTION.,I still must hope that here and there
1108,INTRODUCTION.,Some parts you'll find reward your care.
1109,INTRODUCTION.,"The truth is I, so pleas'd had been"

1118,THE FRIAR.,THE FRIAR.
1119,THE FRIAR.,
1120,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._
1121,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,
1122,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"In a shady nook, with his learned book,"
1123,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,The friar sat with a sanctified look;
1124,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"By his side was rod that was shaped like a crook,"
1125,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Tied to which was a line and a well-baited hook
1126,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Which he dipped in the stream of a rippling brook.
1127,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Now this friar, no doubt, is a lover of trout,"
1128,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,For he chuckles with joy as he 's pulling them out;
1129,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For this savoury fish makes a delicate dish,"
1130,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,As nice as the greatest of monarchs could wish.
1131,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,But there 's one thing he fears--
1132,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,It may come to the ears
1133,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Of the Abbot severe,"
1134,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Who would make him pay dear
1135,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,For thus giving way to his base appetite!
1136,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,When he knows very well
1137,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"He should be in his cell,"
1138,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,And not thus be staying
1139,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"The forest away in,"
1140,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,In the hope that a nibble may end in a bite.
1141,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,For this Abbot was such a strict disciplinarian
1142,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,That roast beef he scorned as the foulest of carrion.
1143,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"His food was the coarsest of bread, and boil'd rice,"
1144,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And half-dirty water, which could not be nice."
1145,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And had he but known that the friar ate trout,"
1146,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Would have made a most terrible riot and rout;
1147,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,And would not have been quiet
1148,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Till he'd alter'd his diet,"
1149,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,And promised he'd never go angling more.
1150,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Which to one of his taste, you may be pretty sure,"
1151,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Would have been a great bother, a plague, and a bore."
1152,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,
1153,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"'T was a morning in May,"
1154,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And a beautiful day,"
1155,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"The little cock sparrows were chirping away,"
1156,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"When the friar, awoke by the birds or the fleas,"
1157,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Quickly rose, gave a yawn, and a cough and a sneeze,"
1158,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,And threw himself into his clothes with great ease.
1159,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But as he was dressing in very great haste,"
1160,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Much time spent in washing he thought would be waste;
1161,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,So a lick and a promise was just to his taste.
1162,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,For he meant to have rose
1163,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Ere the first of the crows
1164,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,From under her snug wing had popped out her nose.
1165,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But to finish a dream he had slumb'ring kept,"
1166,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And thus, long past the hour he intended, had slept."
1167,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"So now from his chamber with speed forth he crept,"
1168,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And bent his course the forest through,"
1169,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Whose branches, spangled o'er with dew,"
1170,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Being shook, soon made him sparkle too."
1171,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,But nought would he heed were he wet to the skin;
1172,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"It is not for his outside he cares, but his in;"
1173,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,And he thinks of the feast he shall have with a grin
1174,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,As he reaches the spot in the thick forest where
1175,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,The trees had been cut down and left a place bare.
1176,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And soon his rod finds, which with excellent care"
1177,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"He had hidden, lest others the sport too might share."
1178,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"As I told you before, by his side was a book;"
1179,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But not that within it he e'er wished to look,"
1180,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,For his mind was in truth at the point of his hook.
1181,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But, to form an excuse,"
1182,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,It might be of great use
1183,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,If any should happen that part by to stray;
1184,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,For it then would appear
1185,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Unto them very clear,"
1186,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,He to study had fled from the world far away.
1187,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Now, lest some fair reader be wishing to hear"
1188,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"How he got his fish dress'd, I will pause awhile here"
1189,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And explain how it was, though it cause slight delay;"
1190,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Still in hopes for your patience my tale may repay.
1191,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"At the back of the wood was a tumble-down dwelling,"
1192,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,But when 'twas erected is now long past telling;
1193,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Its roof might with straw, perchance, once have been thatched,"
1194,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Though now from the rafters 'twas near all detached.
1195,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But heather and mud were in place substituted,"
1196,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Which seemed with the rest of the mansion well suited.
1197,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For the windows, with rags stopped to keep out the rain,"
1198,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Though admitting rheumatics, yet owned not a pane;"
1199,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,While the door from its hinges had gone to supply
1200,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,A trough for the lady who lived in the sty.
1201,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Then as to the garden, 'twas quite a disgrace,"
1202,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,You never beheld such a wild-looking place.
1203,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"The grass than the flowers had grown somewhat higher,"
1204,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Entangled with bushes of bramble and brier.
1205,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,The trees and the bushes were so much neglected
1206,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"That fruit was ne'er looked for, as 'twas not expected."
1207,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"The hedges, so fine once, had lost all their beauty,"
1208,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,And look'd like policemen forgetting their duty;
1209,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Who would not take even the trouble to keep
1210,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Away from the garden the cows and the sheep,"
1211,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Which over or under would manage to creep,"
1212,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,T' enjoy 'mid the flowers a sweet fragrant sleep.
1213,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,
1214,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Now the Queen of this mansion was Widow O'Neal,"
1215,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,A lady of Irish extraction;
1216,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Who often procured our good friar a meal,"
1217,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Which gave him supreme satisfaction.
1218,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For though she a rum 'un might seem to the look,"
1219,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,She was without doubt a most excellent cook;
1220,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And could give fish and game such a delicate taste,"
1221,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"That your platter you'd empty in double-quick haste,"
1222,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Nor a scrap, nor a morsel would e'er chance to waste."
1223,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Now of children this widow had four,"
1224,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"As handsome a set as you anywhere saw,"
1225,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Although you the country have travelled right o'er.
1226,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"The eldest, her pet, was a beautiful boy,"
1227,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"The pride of his mother, her treasure, her joy;"
1228,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Whose light hair crept over his head like a mat,"
1229,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And boasted the 'nomen of ""Clever Young Pat."""
1230,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For he could milk cows, and was once known to try"
1231,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"To milk the old sow, but, alas! found her dry,"
1232,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,So left her in future at rest in her sty.
1233,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,For birds' nests Pat climbed up the tallest of trees--
1234,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,The greater the danger the more it would please.
1235,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"A stranger to fear as to sorrow was he,"
1236,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,For nothing delighted his heart like a spree;
1237,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And often, and dearly, his neighbours had rued"
1238,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,The spirits of fun which young Patrick pursued.
1239,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Then in racing he'd beat all competitors hollow,"
1240,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,And would leave them behind at a distance to follow.
1241,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For he had a knack,"
1242,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Without e'er a whack,--"
1243,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,As he stuck tight as wax to the animal's back--
1244,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,To make it proceed
1245,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,With such rapid speed
1246,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,That you'd doubt if 'twas really a jackass indeed.
1247,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,
1248,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"The next two were daughters, and might be called fair,"
1249,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For brightly would glitter their dark glossy hair,"
1250,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"As bandless and free, by no fetters confined"
1251,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"(Except when a wild flower its sweetness entwined),"
1252,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,'Twas wafted about by the impudent wind.
1253,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Then their eyes, black as sloes, with a sweet sunny smile,"
1254,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Would surely your thoughts for a moment beguile,"
1255,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And cause you, though hurried, to tarry awhile"
1256,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"To ask the best way to the neighbouring town,"
1257,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Or frame some excuse from your horse to get down
1258,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Just to look at the view from a picturesque stile
1259,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Of these two lovely daughters of Erin's green isle.
1260,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,
1261,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"The widow's fourth child was a delicate boy,"
1262,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Whose life seemed to hang by a thread;
1263,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"His ailings and wants both his sisters employ,"
1264,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Whose love even health seemed to shed.
1265,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For as his weak limbs were unable to walk,"
1266,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,They'd carry him up to the top of the hill;
1267,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And so would amuse with their innocent talk,"
1268,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,That he'd almost forget what it was to be ill.
1269,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And when the sun rose with his hot scorching rays,"
1270,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"They'd seek a cool spot in the forest shade, where"
1271,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"They would sing him to sleep with their sweet native lays,"
1272,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,And watch o'er his slumbers with sisterly care.
1273,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Then one would roam forth for his favourite flower,"
1274,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,And twine a fair wreath for his delicate brow;
1275,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Or weave round him sleeping a fairy-like bower,"
1276,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,By drooping and tangling the hazel's green bough.
1277,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,
1278,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But now to return to our friar, who still"
1279,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Is trying his utmost to catch and to kill
1280,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"A few members more of the slippery tribe,"
1281,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,With fine red worms dangling by way of a bribe.
1282,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,
1283,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"The sun long had risen, whose powerful ray"
1284,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Has scattered the dew-drops in vapour away;
1285,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And though our good friar had chose a snug spot,"
1286,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"O'ershadow'd by trees, yet they sheltered him not"
1287,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,In the midst of the day;
1288,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,For the sun then that way
1289,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Came over the water and stared in his face.
1290,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But, a fisherman true,"
1291,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Though he's roasted quite through,"
1292,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,To give o'er the sport he would think a disgrace;
1293,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"So he sits down again,"
1294,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Although fearing 'tis vain,"
1295,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,And for the dead worm puts a fresh in its place.
1296,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Then he looks at his fish, which are covered with grass,"
1297,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"(Lest any one rambling should happen to pass),"
1298,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But he finds there's but two, and those small ones, alas!"
1299,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"So he said, ""But one half-hour I'll stay here, and then"
1300,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,If I don't catch another I'll go to my den.
1301,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For I might just as well be performing my duty,"
1302,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,As being here roasted and spoiling my beauty.
1303,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But let's see, by the bye,"
1304,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,They might rise at a fly--
1305,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"There's lots on the wing, so I'll catch one and try."""
1306,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But this bait they refuse,"
1307,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,For they none of them choose
1308,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,By his kind endeavours existence to lose.
1309,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For when he threw fly they would all run away,"
1310,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Or round it would gambol and sportively play,"
1311,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,But never allowed it to lead them astray.
1312,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,
1313,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"""Oh, the half-hour has past"
1314,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And this throw is my last!"""
1315,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"The old friar exclaimed, when his hook was caught fast"
1316,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"By the bough of a tree,"
1317,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And he could not get free,"
1318,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Though he tugg'd and used words you shall not hear from me.
1319,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But finding his hand must the line disengage,"
1320,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"He turned, much excited (but not in a rage),"
1321,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"When a ghastly hue over his countenance spread,"
1322,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Before which the colour so instantly fled
1323,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"That it whitened his nose, which was mostly bright red,"
1324,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And made him look just like a calf over-bled,"
1325,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Or a hot piece of pork from a pig too well-fed;
1326,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For, suddenly shook by a terrible fright,"
1327,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Like a gander when seized by a fox late at night,"
1328,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,He discovered his wits had deserted him quite.
1329,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For the Abbot he spied,"
1330,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Who with slow solemn stride
1331,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Was approaching, and soon would be close at his side."
1332,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"How he trembled all o'er, and would gladly have died,"
1333,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"As he thought of escape, but could see no way how;"
1334,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,While the cold perspiration spread over his brow.
1335,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Oh, how he then wished that the earth would quake too,"
1336,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,And split a small crack which would just let him through
1337,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"To shield him from evil he feared would betide,"
1338,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,From which he's unable to run or to hide.
1339,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,But as to his wishes the earth's disinclined.
1340,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"He shook himself well, and then struggled to find"
1341,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,What he'd lost in the panic--his presence of mind.
1342,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,His line then he snaps from its perch with a crack
1343,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"And throws his rod into the stream with a smack,"
1344,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Although with the fear of not getting it back
1345,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"His heart's pit-a-pat, and is quite on the rack."
1346,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But he stopped not to think--'twas the work of a minute,"
1347,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,He snatches his book up to see what is in it.
1348,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"When, as if spiteful Fate had resolved his disgrace,"
1349,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,He finds out 'tis another popped into its place
1350,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"By young Patrick O'Neal, who had thought it fine fun;"
1351,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"When the friar, not noticing what he had done,"
1352,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Placed the book in his bosom and bore it away,"
1353,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"After dining, self-asked, at the cottage one day."
1354,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But it now is too late,"
1355,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"If unlucky his fate,"
1356,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,There is no time the book now to hide;
1357,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For the Abbot's so near,"
1358,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,There would surely appear
1359,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Something wrong if to hide it he tried.
1360,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"So he shut it up gently and seemed wrapt in mystery,"
1361,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Though all his thoughts dwelt on the marvellous history
1362,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Of George and the Dragon, who, Saint though he be,"
1363,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,He heartily wished in the depths of the sea.
1364,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Then spake he aloud as the Abbot drew near
1365,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"(In tones like the crow, as melodious and clear),"
1366,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,As it much was his wish that it plain might appear
1367,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"That of his good presence he had no idea,"
1368,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Though he did very well know
1369,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,He was close at his elbow.
1370,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,So he moralized thus:
1371,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"""Oh, that men were like us,"
1372,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"From pleasure abstaining,"
1373,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,From treasure refraining
1374,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Their hands and their hearts! but, alas! it is vain in"
1375,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,This earth for perfection to seek.
1376,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,For all men are for gaining;
1377,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Gold by some means obtaining;
1378,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Their covetous wishes not once e'er restraining.
1379,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Frail mortals, alas, are so weak!""----"
1380,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Much more he had said, but a touch on the shoulder"
1381,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Made the blood through each vein run more sluggish and colder.
1382,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But starting and turning with well-feigned surprise,"
1383,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Saw reflected his face in the Abbot's dark eyes.
1384,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Then a bow, long and low, to his rev'rence he made--"
1385,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,A rev'rence his rev'rence would always have paid;
1386,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For deep in his bosom he cherished the hope,"
1387,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"That, some day or other, they would make him the Pope."
1388,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Now the Abbot was tall, and so terribly thin,"
1389,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"That victuals scarce ever, you'd think, were asked in"
1390,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,To fill up the gap 'twixt the bones and the skin.
1391,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,The little of hair he had left on his crown
1392,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Was a dingy short circle of snuff-colour'd brown,"
1393,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Which straight as the ribs of umbrella hung down.
1394,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"His teeth good as new were, for, little in use,"
1395,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,They could not well plead that old-fashioned excuse
1396,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Of aching, because they're decayed or grown loose."
1397,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But his eye was his pride--'twas a regular piercer,"
1398,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Than even a Cyclops it made him look fiercer;
1399,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,For it stared every way
1400,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"At the same time of day,"
1401,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Nor yet from yourself for a moment would stray.
1402,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Now of his left optic I've heard, and don't doubt it,"
1403,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"He really had seen, and looked better without it;"
1404,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For, besides being not half so big as the other,"
1405,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"It would squint, blink, and wink at its handsome twin brother."
1406,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,
1407,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But the mind, after all, is the part of the man"
1408,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Which beauty should live in--deny it who can.
1409,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,While the face serves alone for an index to tell
1410,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,The force of the passions which inwardly dwell.
1411,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"When all's fair within, it will turn to a smile;"
1412,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"When vexed, it will change to a frown."
1413,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"If angry, most like 'twill be stormy awhile;"
1414,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"When sad, fast the rain will come down."
1415,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But to rambling a truce,"
1416,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"I the reins have let loose,"
1417,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,But my spirited muse I to back must induce.
1418,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For all I would say is, an ugly exterior"
1419,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Is often the fate of a mind that's superior.
1420,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Now the Abbot was one whose mind was his forte; he
1421,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Could never remember a thing he'd done naughty.
1422,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"His life would, he said, bear the strictest inspection--"
1423,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"It never could yield an unpleasant reflection,"
1424,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Because he had brought it so near to perfection.
1425,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,In languages dead he was learned and skilful;
1426,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"His head with quotations, in fact, seemed so filled full"
1427,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"That when condescending he happened to speak,"
1428,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,You would nearly be smothered with Latin and Greek.
1429,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But as my fair readers may chance to know neither,"
1430,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,I will not here tax their sweet patience with either.
1431,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,Not because when I was a young one at school
1432,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"I neglected declension, and grammar, and rule;"
1433,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But just for this reason, I would not perplex"
1434,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"A specimen fair of the feminine sex,"
1435,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Who, not fond of skipping, might feel rather vexed"
1436,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,If forced to leap over some old defunct text.
1437,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,
1438,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"[Illustration: ""What dost thou here, Peter?""]"
1439,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,
1440,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"""What dost thou here, Peter?"" the Abbot exclaimed;"
1441,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"""Explain, let me see if there's aught to be blamed:"
1442,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"For as What's-his-name says, in his Justice with Jury,"
1443,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"You ne'er at the culprit should fly in a fury,"
1444,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,But hear of the question--both sides ere convicting--
1445,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Although you're quite certain which way you'll verdict him."""
1446,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Then the friar his courage plucked up in a minute,"
1447,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,A mess was before him and he was near in it.
1448,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,A stroke swift and bold was the only plan waiting
1449,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,By which he might hope for a safe extricating.
1450,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"But while thus he was thinking the sage Abbot spoke,"
1451,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,He was three-fourths in earnest but one-fourth in joke--
1452,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"""What, speechless! then guilty you are I'm quite sure;"
1453,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,For not proving innocent's guilty by law.
1454,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"As the same author says, who lately I quoted,"
1455,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Whose works for their truth and great clearness are noted."""
1456,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,
1457,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"""O, help me, dear Fiction!"" soliloquised Peter,"
1458,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"(A-muse-meant t'invoke when Miss Truth we would cheat her),"
1459,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"""For without a few fibs I must really confess,"
1460,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,I shall never get out of this terrible mess.
1461,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"Then aid me, fair maiden, to frame some fine story"
1462,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,"To puzzle this old chap who now stands before me."""
1463,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,
1464,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,*       *       *       *       *
1465,_CHAPTER THE FIRST._,
1466,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._
1467,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1468,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,The muse was propitious; how could she decline
1469,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,A man so determined through her smiles to shine?
1470,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"So, gulping his fear down, and banishing fuss,"
1471,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Began his defence with a steady voice, thus,--"
1472,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""No, I'm not, as your highness might justly suppose,"
1473,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"In error entrapped, as my tale shall disclose;"
1474,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"For my life is as pure as this clear crystal stream,"
1475,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And reflects yon bright light as it does the sun's beam.
1476,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Last night, after hours of watching and fasting,"
1477,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,To slumber unconscious my wearied eyes passed in;
1478,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,When a vision I saw
1479,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Coming in at the door,"
1480,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Which beckoned me thrice with her hand.
1481,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,So I quickly arose
1482,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And slipt into my clothes,"
1483,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,To fulfil this said spectre's command.
1484,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Then she marched on before
1485,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Through a small secret door,"
1486,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And hurried away at such double-quick pace,"
1487,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"That I forced was to run,"
1488,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Till I almost begun
1489,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,To think I was in for a long wild-goose chase.
1490,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,But at length she stood still
1491,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,On the top of the hill
1492,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Where old farmer Jonas has set up his mill;
1493,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And pointing below,"
1494,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Said, 'There you must go,"
1495,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,To hear and see things which concern you to know.'
1496,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Then turning my head I beheld a faint, dim light,"
1497,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Which told me that some one was robbing old grim Night,"
1498,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And making my mind up to see what was doing,"
1499,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,I asked the young lady if she would go too in.
1500,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But she spoke not a word,"
1501,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"So I thought she'd not heard,"
1502,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And called out again in a much louder key;
1503,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"When I found she had flown,"
1504,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And had left me alone,"
1505,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,To go by myself this said mystery to see.
1506,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"So I quickly descended,"
1507,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And towards the light wended
1508,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"My steps, though it seemed to be far, far away."
1509,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Though I walked for an hour
1510,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Fast as legs have the power,"
1511,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Yet far in the distance appeared the faint ray.
1512,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Then I weary became,"
1513,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,For I thought that the flame
1514,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Must be but a will-o'-the-wisp after all.
1515,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"When like magic appear'd,"
1516,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"On an eminence rear'd,"
1517,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"A hut, whence the light seemed in streams forth to play."
1518,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But as I was gazing the light was extinguished,"
1519,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And nothing but darkness could well be distinguished.
1520,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Still I groped on, determined the goal now to win."
1521,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But the hut, though soon found,"
1522,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I had yet to walk round,"
1523,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Ere the door I perceived, when I tapped to begin;"
1524,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,But a growl and a groan
1525,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Were the answers alone
1526,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"That I got, so I lifted the latch and walked in."
1527,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"When, oh! what a sight to my eyes was portrayed!"
1528,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"It made my flesh crawl--I was almost afraid,"
1529,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And nearly had run out again.
1530,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But, quick plucking up courage, I stirred up the fire,"
1531,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Which, though nearly extinguished, soon shot up much higher"
1532,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And showed ev'ry thing plain.
1533,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"On a pallet, which seemed almost touching the fire,"
1534,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Made of rushes and heather embedded with mire,"
1535,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"In a hollow scooped out of the floor,"
1536,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"The skeleton form of a female was lying,"
1537,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Who, terribly groaning, appeared to be dying;"
1538,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,I twice thought the struggle was o'er.
1539,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"When she lifted her arm that was shrivelled and bare,"
1540,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And raised up her head with a wild piercing stare,"
1541,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,To demand who I was? what I wanted? and why
1542,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I'd intruded where lonely she'd lived, and would die?"
1543,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Then begging her pardon, I told her I bore"
1544,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"The order of monkhood, and grieved that I saw"
1545,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,One who soon must be leaving this earth far behind
1546,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"So uneasy, and sorely perplexed in her mind."
1547,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But confession, I said, is the readiest way"
1548,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"To purchase relief; O then, wherefore delay,"
1549,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,When I'm ready to hear all you're willing to say?
1550,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Then flushes, like fire, o'er her visage of stone"
1551,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Flew swift, as she threw herself down with a groan;"
1552,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And seemed quite determined that nothing she'd own.
1553,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"For a minute or two there was silent suspense,"
1554,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"When, as past hope of pardon I deemed my offence,"
1555,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,I decided 'twas best I should hasten far hence.
1556,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,So gently on tiptoe I walked to the door.
1557,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But suddenly turning, my movement she saw,"
1558,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And fixing upon me her keen piercing eye
1559,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"She bid me remain, as she meant to comply"
1560,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"With what I'd requested, and make her confession,"
1561,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,In hopes that her anguish of mind it might lessen.
1562,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"'You must know then,' she said,"
1563,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,'That I formerly led
1564,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"The life of a gipsy, till seized with the gout;"
1565,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"When as I no more with my race could roam out,"
1566,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Each one of my tribe
1567,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Agreed to subscribe
1568,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"To build me a cottage, or shed of some kind,"
1569,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Where shelter and rest in my pain I might find.
1570,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,'Twas a beautiful glen
1571,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Where these generous men
1572,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Erected my dwelling in less than a week,"
1573,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"For they had not far for materials to seek,"
1574,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,For a forest hard by
1575,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Did the timber supply,"
1576,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Which they axed to support roof and ceiling.
1577,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But though, after all, 'twas a rough-looking shed,"
1578,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,I thought as I lay on my soft heather bed
1579,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,That a monarch might envy my feelings.
1580,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But, alas! the next day,"
1581,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,The young Baron that way
1582,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Chanced to pass as out hunting he rode,"
1583,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Who stopp'd to inquire,"
1584,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"In tones full of ire,"
1585,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Who had dared to erect that abode
1586,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"In his favorite glen,"
1587,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Which he occupied when
1588,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,He gave a grand fête out in open air?
1589,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Then very soon after some servants appear'd,"
1590,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Who quickly began, as I sadly had fear'd,"
1591,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,To put my poor cottage quite out of repair.
1592,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,How I moaned! how I groaned!
1593,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Their compassion to raise.
1594,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Though all proved, alas! of no use."
1595,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"They cared not. They dared not,"
1596,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Against what their lord says,"
1597,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,To act if they that way should choose.
1598,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"So they dragged off the thatch,"
1599,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And tore down each rafter;
1600,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,While I underneath catch
1601,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"The dust, and their laughter;"
1602,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And would not remove till all was destroyed,"
1603,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,As if 'twas my anguish the ruffians enjoyed.
1604,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"'Again in a hurry you'll not build,' said they,"
1605,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"As lifting they bore me with speed far away,"
1606,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Though roaring and screaming with pain.
1607,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,They saw I was fainting yet checked not their pace;
1608,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And left me at last in a lone barren place,"
1609,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Where shelter I looked for in vain.
1610,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"For the sun seemed to scorch with his terrible might,"
1611,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And I feared that the damp chills descending at night
1612,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Would double my aches and my pain.
1613,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,But soon o'er the sky such a black cloud spread
1614,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,That quickly the rays of the bright sun fled;
1615,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,As it darker and darker grew.
1616,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Then the lightning flashed, and the thunder roared,"
1617,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"The hail and the rain down in torrents poured,"
1618,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And the wind tempestuous blew.
1619,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I was soon soaked through, while each drop of rain"
1620,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And the dart-like hail caused a shoot of pain,"
1621,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Till I raved with torture wild;
1622,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And swore, in the darkness of fell despair,"
1623,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,As I tore in my fury my whit'ning hair--
1624,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Though weak as a puny child.
1625,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"(For I wished to move, but in vain I tried,)"
1626,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I had slain myself, and had willingly died,"
1627,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Though sworn to be revenged.
1628,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"For I swore that nothing should cool my rage,"
1629,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"No kindness hereafter my hate assuage,"
1630,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Till I'd myself avenged.'
1631,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"The gipsy here stopped short and breathed,"
1632,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And much that rest she needed;
1633,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,But soon as she had strength received
1634,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Thus on the tale proceeded:--
1635,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1636,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"'My tribe,' said she, 'the next day found"
1637,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"The cottage levelled with the ground,"
1638,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And searching, found me lying"
1639,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Some distance from the ruined heap,"
1640,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"From numbing pain sunk deep in sleep,"
1641,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Worn out with rage and crying.
1642,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"They raised this hut above my head,"
1643,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Spread under me this heather bed.
1644,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And tended me with care.
1645,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"When, strange to say, I soon revived,"
1646,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Pains sharper e'en than death survived,"
1647,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And had of health my share.
1648,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But still I lived here, lest a fresh attack"
1649,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Might trip up my heels if I turned my back,"
1650,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And stretch me again on the painful rack.
1651,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And I nursed revenge, till with rage imprest."
1652,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,I dreamed of revenge when I sank to rest.
1653,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"My thoughts were revenge from the dawn of day,"
1654,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Till the darkness scattered the light away.
1655,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Oh, I pined for revenge as a maiden pines"
1656,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,For her lover returning from distant climes;
1657,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Who expects every day till remorseless eve
1658,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Makes her hope for next morn--for the present, grieve."
1659,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,All hope worse than hopeless appeared to be
1660,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"When fate, fiends, or fortune befriended me."
1661,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"'Twas a gala day, and the loathsome glen"
1662,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Resounded with laughter from joyful men.
1663,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I could see the grand tents where the flags waved high,"
1664,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And I gathered the news from a passer-by.
1665,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,'Twas the christ'ning-day of the son and heir
1666,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Of the Baron's estates and castles fair;
1667,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And guests without end were invited there,"
1668,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,To a sumptuous feast in the open air.
1669,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But, oh! 'twas a dreadful day for me;"
1670,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,'Must ever my rage then fruitless be?'
1671,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I said, and felt I could have willing died,"
1672,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Had the means of revenge then been supplied.
1673,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But again the sun sank swift away,"
1674,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And twilight attended expiring day.
1675,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"All nature appears preparing for sleep,"
1676,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,While wakeful alone mine eyelids keep.
1677,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But, hark, what's that?--the tramp of horse!"
1678,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Who hitherward can bend his course?
1679,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,There's no highroad this way.
1680,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"'Tis some one who, by yonder light,"
1681,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Where revels turn to day the night,"
1682,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Has here been led astray.
1683,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But, lo! he knocks, and straight walks in,"
1684,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"A gloomy figure tall and thin,"
1685,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,A bundle on his arm!
1686,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Who quickly gazed around to see
1687,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,If any one abode with me.
1688,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,His eye bespoke alarm.
1689,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"'Your pleasure, Sir?' I rising said."
1690,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,'I live alone in this poor shed;
1691,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"If you the bridle-path would seek,"
1692,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,'Tis hidden by yon dark hill's peak.
1693,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"If 'tis the Baron's stately hall,"
1694,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Yon lights will guide, where rout and ball--'"
1695,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"'Stop, dame, 'tis none of these, but you"
1696,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I seek, and what I'd have you do"
1697,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I quick must tell, for time away"
1698,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Flies fast, and long I dare not stay."
1699,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"This babe,' he said, 'so young and fair,"
1700,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,I leave a nursling to your care
1701,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,For five short hours; when three times told
1702,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Their number--I will pay you gold--
1703,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"The child myself I'll fetch, till then"
1704,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Preserve it from all earthly ken.'
1705,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1706,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"He left; the babe was softly sleeping,"
1707,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Its little eyes were red with weeping,"
1708,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,As if from recent pain.
1709,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I kissed its little tiny hand,"
1710,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And tried its tale to understand,"
1711,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"When o'er each limb a trembling spread,"
1712,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"A giddiness attacked my head,"
1713,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,My brain was growing wild.
1714,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Oh, could it be the Baron's heir,"
1715,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,That had been left my couch to share?
1716,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Yes, it must be his child!"
1717,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,In haste the snowy robes I tore;
1718,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,A coronet each garment bore--
1719,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,The infant woke and smiled.
1720,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I groaned, and turned my head away,"
1721,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,When crowing it began to play;
1722,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Nor showed the least alarm.
1723,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I neared, it raised its head at this,"
1724,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,As if it sought a mother's kiss--
1725,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,I could not do it harm.
1726,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I gave it food; and soon to rest,"
1727,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Like some young bird in leafy nest,"
1728,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"It slumb'ring fell, without a fear"
1729,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"For morrow's care, or danger near."
1730,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I sat me down the bed beside,"
1731,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And tried to sleep, but vainly tried."
1732,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,The terrors of the dreadful past
1733,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Were crowding through my mem'ry fast.
1734,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,The months and months of fruitless hate
1735,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Which mocked my eager rage of late;
1736,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"The hope of morn, despair of eve,"
1737,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"The night, when blasted hopes I'd grieve,"
1738,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,All stood before me; and with smother'd cries
1739,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Bid me revenge while Fate the chance supplies;
1740,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Then stole away, when that most dreadful night"
1741,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,With shiv'ring anguish passed before my sight.
1742,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Once more, methought, I lay upon the plain;"
1743,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Once more was rack'd with that tormenting pain;
1744,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Again I felt that flood of piercing hail,"
1745,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And screamed for succour, but without avail."
1746,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Then suddenly another phantom near'd,"
1747,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And lo! the dreadful oath I'd sworn appear'd.
1748,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"'Revenge, revenge!' its pale lips seemed to say,"
1749,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,As pointing where the slumb'ring infant lay;
1750,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"'Seize thy sole chance, nor lose it by delay.'"
1751,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I started, rose, and paced the hut across;"
1752,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"When from a distance came the tramp of horse,"
1753,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"While louder still the spectre madly cries,"
1754,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"'Revenge, revenge, ere chance for ever flies!'"
1755,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"'Twas dark, I groped until the babe I found,"
1756,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Then scrunched its neck, until without a sound"
1757,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,It died--then flung it lifeless to the ground.
1758,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"A knock, a call, the door wide open flew,"
1759,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,With hurried step the stranger hastens through.
1760,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""The child! be quick, I'm 'fore the hour I told,"
1761,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,But there you'll find the promised sum of gold.'
1762,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"His purse he flung into my lap, but still"
1763,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,I did not stir his orders to fulfil.
1764,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"He cast his eyes around, then gazed on me,"
1765,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,The object sought for he could nowhere see.
1766,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"'Woman!' he cried, 'hast thou thy trust betrayed?"
1767,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Thy treach'ry base shall swiftly be repaid.'
1768,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"He seized my hand, nigh crushed it in his own,"
1769,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Yet still I uttered not the slightest groan,"
1770,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But flung his gaze back with a fearless eye,"
1771,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And said, 'Revenged, I care not if I die!"
1772,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"The babe no more will cross thy path below,"
1773,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Nephew of Baron Reginald, I know"
1774,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Thy pale face now, and guess the reason why"
1775,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Thou fear'st to lose thy stolen property.'
1776,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Just then 'twixt clouds a straggling beam revealed
1777,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,The corner where the infant lay concealed.
1778,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"He raised it up, then raved with anger wild,"
1779,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"To see 'twas dead, whilst I with pleasure smiled,"
1780,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And said that I, yes I, had slain the child."
1781,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"'O wretch!' he cried, 'the gallows is too good"
1782,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,(But yet I dare not harm her if I would.
1783,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"My heart grows faint, is overpowered with dread,"
1784,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,The falling blow would also cleave my head:
1785,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I ne'er intended it should go thus far,"
1786,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Yet still the guilt and recompense mine are).
1787,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Speak, wretched woman! say, what tempted thee?"
1788,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Thou ne'er couldst think this crime would pleasure me.
1789,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Thy witch-like spells, by which ye think to know"
1790,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"My secret plans, are false--yea, doubly so.'"
1791,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"'Doubt as you like, but hear what I would tell,"
1792,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Then say if I have learnt my story well.
1793,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Yon babe you stole to rob him of his lands,"
1794,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And as afraid with blood to stain your hands,"
1795,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"You meant to bear him to some distant shore,"
1796,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Where parents' smiles would bless the child no more.
1797,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But not for thee I crushed the viper's brood,"
1798,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Far other thoughts and impulse I pursued.
1799,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"It was revenge, deep rankling in my breast,"
1800,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,That sent the infant to its last long rest.
1801,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"With hate I'd sworn, if chance should e'er incline,"
1802,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"To cause him pangs unbearable as mine,"
1803,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"On that dark night when, deluged with the rain,"
1804,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I called on death to terminate my pain,"
1805,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"My hut from o'er my head was torn, and I"
1806,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Was left in dreadful agony to die
1807,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"By his commands: then am I much to blame,"
1808,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,When greatest heroes boast of such-like shame?'
1809,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1810,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""No, woman, I can blame thine act no more;"
1811,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Thy tale, methinks, I've somewhere heard before."
1812,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"The guilt's more mine--thy life I'll therefore save,"
1813,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And bear this infant to some distant grave,"
1814,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Where dark oblivion shall his tombstone be,"
1815,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"In secret 'graved, unknown to all but me.'"
1816,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1817,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"''Not whilst I live'!--I seized the babe, and cried."
1818,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,''The corse is mine--the fun'ral I'll provide--
1819,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Beneath my bed its resting-place shall be:
1820,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,'Twill bring me sleep when slumber fain would flee.
1821,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Thou ne'er hast felt that heart-consuming power,"
1822,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"That rage increasing each successive hour,"
1823,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,That desp'rate longing to annihilate
1824,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,The wretch who dares augment our cruel fate;
1825,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,But think not I to foes would thee betray:
1826,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"No, hidden there the infant safe shall lay"
1827,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Till coming years shall rot each bone away.''
1828,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1829,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""Swear this to me,' he said, 'and I depart;"
1830,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,But let no temptings of thy magic art
1831,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Lead thee astray, for death must be thy lot"
1832,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,If e'er the oath of silence be forgot.
1833,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1834,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But as I'd keep thee now from further sin,"
1835,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Whene'er I pass this way I'll just look in;
1836,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Or send you gold, which ne'er fails to impart"
1837,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,The balm of comfort to a broken heart.'
1838,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1839,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""I willing swear, but not through threats,' said I,"
1840,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""For life's a burden; but I'll tell you why:"
1841,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Uncertain fears shall wear away his heart,"
1842,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,And even wealth shall fail to soothe his smart.'
1843,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1844,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""He left--the babe beneath my couch was laid,"
1845,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Beside the gold which seemed for murder paid,"
1846,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"With larger sums at diff'rent seasons brought,"
1847,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,For though half starved I yet would handle naught.
1848,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1849,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""But in the morn you it shall all exhume"
1850,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,If you will swear my body to entomb
1851,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Within this spot, and faithfully incline"
1852,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,To grant my dying wishes--then 'tis thine.
1853,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,I would the haughty Baron soon should know
1854,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"What hand it is has laid his glory low,"
1855,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,That she it is whose hut he once destroyed
1856,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Who now of heirs has made his house thus void.''
1857,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1858,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""She more had said, but sense appeared to stray,"
1859,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Yea, even life was ebbing fast away."
1860,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,'Begone! begone!' was all she'd strength to say.
1861,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I left, persuaded morn would see her clay."
1862,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"This morning early rising there I went,"
1863,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"--To seek the money, p'rhaps, my chief intent--"
1864,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"When neither the hut could anywhere be found,"
1865,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Nor yet the old lady, or trace on the ground;"
1866,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"So that really I thought, ere from slumber I woke,"
1867,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"She had vanished away like a cigar, in smoke."
1868,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1869,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""This then is, your rev'rence, the whole of my tale--"
1870,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"That I'm disappointed I greatly bewail,"
1871,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,For I meant to enrich with this wealth given me
1872,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"(As a proof of my zeal) this great monastery."""
1873,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1874,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""And this,"" said the Abbot, ""you plead in defence?"
1875,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,I'm almost persuaded 'tis but a pretence;
1876,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Yet, in justice, I cannot my credence refuse"
1877,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Until I discover my trust you abuse.
1878,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But if ever in falsehood you once are found out,"
1879,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,My anger would heavily fall there's no doubt.
1880,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Then it was, after all, but a slumb'ring delusion,--"
1881,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Just a slight indigestion, which caused this illusion?"
1882,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Still tell me, how is it I find you out here?"""
1883,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""To meditate, sir, on these doings so queer,"
1884,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I meant to devote a few moments to thought,"
1885,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,To see if by chance I could recollect aught
1886,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Of the hut's situation, as likely I might"
1887,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"P'rhaps have lost the right track through the darkness of night,"
1888,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"For the scenes of each action so plain to me seem,"
1889,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I can never believe 'twas a shadowy dream."""
1890,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""May I ask,"" said the Abbot, ""what book you're perusing?"
1891,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I am sure 'tis instructive, I hope 'tis amusing."""
1892,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""Well really, your rev'rence, I can't say it aint,"
1893,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"For 'tis an account of a very great saint,"
1894,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Who all kinds of evil with boldness defied,"
1895,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And ever was victor when battle he tried."""
1896,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1897,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Oh how heartily now the poor friar did wish
1898,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"He would go, for his foot was nigh crushing his fish;"
1899,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But suppose he had seen them, I have little doubt"
1900,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"He'd have said that, unaided, the stream they crept out,"
1901,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,For he ne'er could be trapped for the want of excuse;
1902,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Yet was still his companion most anxious to lose,"
1903,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,For the turn of a rush would have cost him his dinner.
1904,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But kind Fate had determined he should not get thinner,"
1905,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"For the Abbot departed without a word more,"
1906,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And so neither the fish nor the little hook saw,"
1907,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Which was dangling about--quite in sight you'll suppose,"
1908,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,As he nearly was caught once or twice by the nose.
1909,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1910,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"""Ah, ah, ah!"" said the friar, ""now isn't it good?"
1911,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,But I'd better not crow till he's out of the wood.
1912,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"I'm certain he's left me to look for the money,"
1913,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"The greedy old fellow: now isn't it funny,"
1914,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,To know that I have done him who thinks he's so 'cute
1915,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,He ne'er can be baffled in any dispute?
1916,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"O bravo, dear Fiction! you clever old girl,"
1917,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Your banner with pleasure I'll ever unfurl,"
1918,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And rejoice as a slave at your feet low to lie,"
1919,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Till old Fate shall determine that Peter must die.
1920,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"But just wait, let me see"
1921,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,Where my rod and line be.
1922,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Oh, there down midst the rushes they lie snug concealed."
1923,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,But those ill-fated fish
1924,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"Won't get cooked as I wish,"
1925,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,For I'm sure by this time that the taties are peeled.
1926,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,But I know what I'll do:
1927,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"While they're boiling--there's two,"
1928,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,But remarkably small--more's the pity!
1929,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,I will just take a nap
1930,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"In old Somnus's lap,"
1931,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,"And will dream of that angel, Miss Kitty."""
1932,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1933,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,*       *       *       *       *
1934,_CHAPTER THE SECOND._,
1935,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._
1936,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,
1937,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"We must now leave the monk for a moment or two,"
1938,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"And quick after the steps of the Abbot pursue,"
1939,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Who can very fast walk when he thinks he's not seen,"
1940,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"And is scamp'ring now o'er the meadows (so green),"
1941,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"For he really believed that the friar said true,"
1942,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"That he'd lost the right path which would lead the hut to,"
1943,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,But he felt quite determined to find it.
1944,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,And although the sun's rays were so scorchingly hot
1945,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"That he red in the face as a furnace had got,"
1946,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Yet he seemed not a moment to mind it;
1947,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"But clambered each hill's side and ran down each hollow,"
1948,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Oft looking to see if the friar would follow,"
1949,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Not thinking howe'er he'd be found thus.
1950,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"But when we do actions of which we're ashamed,"
1951,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"And conscience informs us we ought to be blamed,"
1952,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,We're sure to look anxious around us.
1953,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""But had not old Peter abandoned the chase,"""
1954,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"The Abbot exclaimed, ""ere I popp'd in his place,"
1955,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,As executor to the old lady?
1956,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Then, besides, but a moment or two back he told"
1957,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,That he meant to devote to our use all the gold.
1958,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Oh, how conscience soon quieted may be!"""
1959,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,
1960,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Now the Abbot remembered that somewhere he'd seen
1961,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"An old tumble-down hut when out rambling he'd been,"
1962,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Which he thought might be it,--and 'twas, by the bye,"
1963,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,The same Peter had all the while in his eye;
1964,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"For he had not erected, as Truth must declare,"
1965,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,The castle on clouds up aloft in the air.
1966,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"But the gold and old lady were really a joke,"
1967,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,And had both been dug out of and buried in smoke.
1968,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Then he happened to know,"
1969,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"About eight years ago,"
1970,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,A child had been lost by the Baron--and oh!
1971,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,He never should think
1972,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Old Peter could link
1973,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Such strange facts together as well deserved ink.
1974,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"So his story was true,"
1975,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,For he very well knew
1976,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,The friar possessed not a grain of romance.
1977,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,'Tis not book study that
1978,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Has made him grow so fat,"
1979,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"'Tis earth's lower pleasures, he fears, does entrance."
1980,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,
1981,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Now a distant rise
1982,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Presents to the eyes
1983,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Of the Abbot the hut, and with joy on he flies;"
1984,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"It is rugged indeed,"
1985,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"But he takes little heed,"
1986,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Though the walls are of mud, and each flower is a weed."
1987,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,
1988,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Not a sound then was heard,"
1989,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Not a chirp from a bird,"
1990,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Nor yet from a little grasshopper;
1991,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Should he knock at the shed,"
1992,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Or straight walk in instead?
1993,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,He wish'd to know which was most proper.
1994,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"For there spread o'er his heart such a feeling of awe,"
1995,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,He felt nervous whenever he ugly sights saw;
1996,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"And now p'rhaps the bed must be moved from the hovel,"
1997,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Before at the gold he can get--then the shovel:
1998,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"O dear, he's forgot it--oh, what shall he do"
1999,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,If there's none within when he penetrates through?
2000,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Then without much dispatch
2001,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"He uplifted the latch,"
2002,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"When he felt 'gainst his legs such a terrible poke,"
2003,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"That he staggered with fear,"
2004,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"And had swooned away near,"
2005,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Ere he saw 'twas a pig who inflicted the stroke;
2006,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"While a rough Irish laugh on his reverie broke,"
2007,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Whose possessor appeared to enjoy much the joke,"
2008,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"And cried, ""Och, the pig has got out of the door!"
2009,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Why couldn't you make a slight shindy before
2010,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,You poked in your carcase?--We'd held then his tail--it
2011,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Must now be 'gen cotched, or some feller will stale it."""
2012,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,But a terrible frown
2013,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"From the Abbot proceeded,"
2014,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"And he rustled his gown,"
2015,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Which at once Loony heeded;
2016,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,For the priests then were held by the whole of the nation
2017,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"In the highest respect, and in great veneration."
2018,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Your pardon, your rev'rence, I knew not 'twas you,"""
2019,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"He humbly exclaimed, whilst his head he was scratching."
2020,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Pray do me the honour to step just into"
2021,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,This bit of a dwelling--it p'rhaps may want thatching;
2022,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Still the holes in the roof make the fire burn better,"
2023,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Though rain, than is pleasant oft makes us much wetter."""
2024,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""No, what I would say I will speak here outside,--"
2025,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"'Tis of the old lady who yesternight died."""
2026,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""She dead! Oh no, no! Though I oft wished she were,"
2027,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Still yonder she sits in the corner down there,"
2028,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"On the edge of a tub, for want of a chair."""
2029,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Quite true,"" said the Abbot, ""for Socrates tells us,"
2030,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Old ladies in breath are as lasting as bellows;
2031,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,But is she not troubled with gout or rheumatic?
2032,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Or is she, from rain oft descending, aquatic?"
2033,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Rheumatics! yes, sure, there's much truth in that question."
2034,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,But what is far worse is her pow'rful digestion;
2035,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,For would ye believe it--within bounds I speak--
2036,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"A sack of best praties would last but a week,"
2037,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,If she was supplied whene'er victuals she'd seek.
2038,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"But she gave us last night such a terrible fright,"
2039,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,When we chanced late to come from the wake of old Wright.
2040,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,For her pains were so bad
2041,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"That she raved just like mad,"
2042,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"And called for a priest, though no priest could be had."
2043,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Still up in the morn she rose better than ever.
2044,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Pain never will kill her, I'm certain,--no, never!"
2045,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"She's my mother-in-law, sir, and not my own mother,"
2046,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Or as welcome she'd be in this world as another."""
2047,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"(""Oh, oh!"" thought the Abbot, ""the way's growing clearer!"
2048,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"I feared I had strayed--but I find the game nearer."")"
2049,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""She would see then a priest? with her wish I'll comply;"
2050,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"But alone it must be, for should you remain by,"
2051,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Any facts I would prove she would surely deny,"
2052,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Though of Mary's great abbey the Primate am I."""
2053,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Well, if ever!"" said Looney, with a wild kind of stare,"
2054,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"As he bolted inside, crying, ""Meg! quick--a chair!"
2055,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"There's the Abbot of Mary's a-standing out there!"""
2056,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Now that Meg was not well might be very well seen,"
2057,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"She'd been waking too late where she'd yesternight been,"
2058,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"For her eyes were as red as a lobster fresh boiled,"
2059,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,And her nose looked like beetroot in cooking when spoiled;
2060,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"So she ran in a corner, where safe she might hide"
2061,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,From the flood of reproofs which she feared might betide.
2062,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Then enter'd the Abbot, his eyes cast around,"
2063,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"And snug in a corner the old lady found,"
2064,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"While away on an errand had Looney been sent,"
2065,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,To prevent his eaves-dropping--if such his intent.
2066,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"(""That shows skill,"" thought Ted, ""but I yet shall defeat it,"
2067,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"For Meg will hear all, and is sure to repeat it."")"
2068,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""She sleeps,"" said the priest, ""and I don't like to wake her,"
2069,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,But fear she won't rouse if I try not to make her;
2070,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"So as time flies fast I will make bold to shake her."""
2071,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Fire! thieves!"" cried the dame. ""O, Meg, what are you arter?"
2072,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"You wicked, ungrateful, neglectful, young darter!"
2073,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"I was dreaming of dinner--oh, such a fine treat!"
2074,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Not of biled praties only, but roast and biled meat."""
2075,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Hush, hush!"" said the Abbot, ""I've heard your sad story,"
2076,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"And much I was grieved at, but felt sorry for ye."""
2077,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Ay, ay,"" she exclaimed, ""did yer spake of the child?"
2078,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"It's nigh broke my heart, and will soon drive me wild."
2079,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Though I don't wish to die, yet the dochters can't save,"
2080,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"When there's grief and rheumatics a-digging my grave."""
2081,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""But the gold,"" said the Abbot, ""I hope it's secure?"""
2082,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Did yer spake? Just spake out, for I'm deaf, certain sure."""
2083,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Down there?"" said he louder, and pointed close by,"
2084,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Yes, there, there,"" she answered, ""the creature will lie,"
2085,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Dead drunk as a baste, while I'm forced to attend"
2086,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"To the cooking and washing, or else a hand lend"
2087,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"For to keep the house tidy, or else the clothes mend:"
2088,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Yet I get but half-fed,"
2089,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Whilst she's snoring in bed.
2090,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"I often have thought I had better be dead."""
2091,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Just so,"" said the priest; ""sure the woman's quite mad."
2092,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Or else forgot all--oh, a spade that I had!"
2093,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"I'd soon have a look if the gold were there still,"
2094,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"And then set to work just to make out her will."""
2095,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"While speaking, he spied 'neath the bed a small leg"
2096,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Without shoe or stocking, which proved to be Meg."
2097,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Oh, she's heard every word, then!"" the Abbot exclaimed;"
2098,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""For the want of more caution I'm much to be blamed;"
2099,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"They will search every spot, and the wealth I shall lose it."
2100,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"But the old dame can help it, and she may not choose it."""
2101,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Och then it is you, sir? I thought it was Ted,"""
2102,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Cried Meg, as she crept from her nook near the bed;"
2103,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""For he's in such a pet of a passion to-day,"
2104,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"That I'm forced for peace sake to keep out of his way."""
2105,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Then too entered Looney, who, panting for breath,"
2106,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Had made up his mind to be in at the death.
2107,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Tom Smithers, yer rev'rence, I met close by here,"
2108,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,With pleasure he'd see yer whenever ye're near.
2109,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"His old father's but bad still--you've heard, I suppose,"
2110,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"He was thrown from his horse and was pitched on his nose?"""
2111,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Yes, I have of it heard, and will see him ere long;"
2112,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"He'd been drinking too much, which was dreadfully wrong."
2113,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"This cottage is small,"" he continued; ""I fear"
2114,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,That comfort and ease you can ne'er enjoy here.
2115,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Besides, you're so far off that you don't get your share"
2116,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Of the gifts I bestow on those under my care.
2117,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Now I have a neat cottage, and 'tis my intent,"
2118,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Ted, to let it to you at a moderate rent."
2119,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"And as to the Abbey, you'll then be so nigh,"
2120,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Its garden will work for your spare hours supply."""
2121,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Hurrah! thanks! your rev'rence!"" cried Ted with delight;"
2122,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""I am grateful, contented, and happy now quite."
2123,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Sure I'll back with you now, sir, and see what it's like,"
2124,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Then with pleasure the bargain I'll readily strike."""
2125,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Then with me at once, and your wife, if she'd see"
2126,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"The dwelling I speak of, can come too with me."
2127,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Though 'tis out of repair, yet to you 'twill appear"
2128,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Like a palace, compared with this old hut out here."
2129,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Then Jenkins will lend you his cart to remove
2130,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Your goods; and, I think, a good neighbour will prove."""
2131,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""Sure I'm ready,"" said Meg,"
2132,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,As she took from a peg
2133,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Her bonnet, which once might have been an old hat."
2134,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"""And,"" cried Ted, ""so am I,"
2135,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Though I feel rather dry,"
2136,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"And maybe his rev'rence admires a good vat."""
2137,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"But a dark frown descending,"
2138,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Made him tremble with awe;
2139,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,He was sadly offending
2140,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"The proud Abbot, he saw."
2141,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Then they went out together,"
2142,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"And, it being hot weather,"
2143,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Their pace was exceedingly slow;
2144,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,While the Abbot endeavours
2145,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,From converse to gather
2146,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,If they of the treasure aught know.
2147,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Now what after befell
2148,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"It is needless to tell,"
2149,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Save the cottage was liked and they went there to dwell.
2150,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,While their hut and its ground
2151,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"Was dug up all around,"
2152,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,Though there never a bone or a guinea was found.
2153,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,
2154,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,"[Illustration: Och then it is you, sir?]"
2155,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,
2156,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,*       *       *       *       *
2157,_CHAPTER THE THIRD._,
2158,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._
2159,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2160,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Now back to the friar
2161,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,I fain must desire
2162,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,My reader's attention to turn;
2163,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Who is round the place looking,"
2164,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"While his fish are a-cooking,"
2165,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,A snug spot for a nap to discern.
2166,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,A box full of worms he has laid by his side--
2167,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"A present young Pat never fails to provide,"
2168,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And gives him whenever he sees him.
2169,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Though often for fun he would place there instead
2170,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"A snail or a frog, or defunct chicken's head;"
2171,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,It gave him such pleasure to tease him.
2172,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For old Peter was one who could not stand a joke,"
2173,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And at one time young Pat got his head nearly broke
2174,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Through a comical trick which he played him.
2175,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For as slumb'ring one day by the water he sat,"
2176,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Pat had fixed to his hook the stale corpse of a cat,"
2177,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And then snug in the river's depth laid him.
2178,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Which the friar, when waking, had deemed a rich prize,"
2179,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And his little mouth watered, and twinkled both eyes,"
2180,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"As in scales, in his mind's eye, he weighed him."
2181,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""I shall lose it, I fear;"
2182,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,I've no landing-net here:
2183,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,I am sure it's a carp or a bream.
2184,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Should he run I am done,"
2185,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,While to help me there's none;
2186,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"O that even young Pat could be seen!"""
2187,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"At that moment appeared,"
2188,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And up suddenly reared
2189,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"The head of Miss Puss, in a very droll way."
2190,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"While a loud laugh up high,"
2191,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"In an oak-tree close by,"
2192,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Told Peter who he for the trick had to pay.
2193,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Oh, you imp of all mischief!"" he cried, ""come down here;"
2194,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For this trick that you've served me I'll make you pay dear."""
2195,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""No, thank you,"" said Pat, with a kind friendly nod;"
2196,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""I'd rather--much rather--not taste of your rod."""
2197,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Now who could stand this? Oh, not he! Round he lashed"
2198,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"His rod; and young Pat, who disliked to be thrashed,"
2199,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Tried to climb up still higher, but losing his hold,"
2200,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Swiftly down to the ground like an o'er-ripe pear roll'd.
2201,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""His neck's broke!"" said Peter; ""the mad, careless calf!"""
2202,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But Pat rose unhurt, and ran off with a laugh."
2203,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2204,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Now deep in the forest the friar had sought
2205,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"A snug shady spot, where no mortal he thought"
2206,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Would ere chance to disturb his repose;
2207,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For with talking and fright
2208,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"He is tired out quite,"
2209,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And would fain on the world his eyes close.
2210,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Above his head
2211,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,A tall oak spread
2212,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Its leafy shade;
2213,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And 'midst the trees
2214,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,The sportive breeze
2215,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,With young boughs played.
2216,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,From ev'ry bird
2217,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,A song was heard
2218,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,As forth they strayed
2219,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Some grub to seize,"
2220,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,While busy bees
2221,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,A buzzing made.
2222,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Reclining on a grassy mound,"
2223,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"His head a velvet cushion found,"
2224,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And bushes weave a curtain round;
2225,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Here ponders he the morning's scene,"
2226,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Till things that are with things that seem
2227,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Together blend and form a dream.
2228,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Again he feels red-hot with fright,"
2229,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Once more his tale he must recite,"
2230,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Must conjure up a thousand lies
2231,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,To blind Suspicion's wakeful eyes--
2232,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Must rise with hope and sink with fear,"
2233,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And all the while must feel most queer.
2234,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2235,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"His tale when told--instead of going,"
2236,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,The Abbot looks most wondrous knowing;
2237,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And says ""'Tis a falsehood,--a fable,"
2238,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Which he to deny is not able,"""
2239,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,As with throbbings of conscience he shook;
2240,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For he could not then think of the frailest excuse,"
2241,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Though he rummaged his brains--it was all of no use,"
2242,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For his cunning and skill him forsook.
2243,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""You are guilty, you sinner!"" the stern Abbot cried;"
2244,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Your confusion betrays you! Now don't try to hide"
2245,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Your wickedness more, for I shall not believe"
2246,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"A word that you say, as you've tried to deceive."""
2247,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Then the poor friar thought
2248,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"That for pardon he sought,"
2249,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But the Abbot appeared not to hear,"
2250,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"When he swooned right away,"
2251,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And insensible lay,"
2252,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Overcome with remorse or with fear.
2253,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"As he came to himself, thinks he, ""I'm in bed;"""
2254,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But very soon after thinks he, ""No, I'm dead:"
2255,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Oh, I feel so uncommonly queer!"
2256,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"I can move neither leg nor an arm,"
2257,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And my tongue's unaccountably calm,--"
2258,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"There is something wrong, certainly, here."
2259,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Where's the Abbot?--He's gone--'tis most like for assistance.
2260,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"They will bury me, p'rhaps, and I can't make resistance:"
2261,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Oh, my doom is now sealed I see clear!"""
2262,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2263,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"As thus he thought, for lips refused to speak,"
2264,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,A queer sensation trickled o'er his cheek.
2265,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"In vain each nerve he strains to turn his eyes,"
2266,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For they're immovable; but soon he spies
2267,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"A large red worm, and in its trail there creep"
2268,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"A dozen more, who prowl about and peep"
2269,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Into his mouth and nose, and tickle so"
2270,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,That what to do he's puzzled much to know.
2271,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""The bait has 'scaped from out my box,"" thought he;"
2272,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""And, while entranced, from spite would bother me."""
2273,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,What would he not have given for a scratch!
2274,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,A good hard rub would even nectar match.
2275,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,The richest feast he felt he could forego
2276,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For the relief of one good sweeping blow.
2277,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""O that some large, emancipated bear,"
2278,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Would for his lunch my corpse in pieces tear!
2279,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Than this dread tickling, I'm persuaded quite,"
2280,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"I'd much enjoy his hug and hearty bite."""
2281,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Hookey!"" exclaimed the worm: ""a bite no more"
2282,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"You'll get from us,--'tis useless to implore."
2283,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"You're 'off the hooks,' as vulgar writers scribble,"
2284,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But we'll supply you with a little nibble."""
2285,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,With this some dozen irritating teeth
2286,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Dashed through his skin, but gave him no relief."
2287,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"His face is stiffened o'er with mud and slime,"
2288,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,While burning rays are scorching all the time
2289,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"His dew-less eyes--and, parched with heat and thirst,"
2290,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,His swollen tongue appears as if 'twould burst.
2291,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Then a red worm arose,"
2292,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Perched a-top of his nose,"
2293,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And clearing his throat made the following speech:--
2294,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""My dearest friend Peter,"
2295,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"As your guests we greet yer,"
2296,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And mean to stick to you as tight as a leech;
2297,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For the bright sun will fry us
2298,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,All the meat you supply us.
2299,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Oh, you're now in such excellent season,"
2300,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"That for months we'll contrive,"
2301,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"If the crows don't arrive,"
2302,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"To repast, though our numbers increase on."
2303,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Now don't look so sulky,--recollect how you used us--"
2304,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,(For your airs and ill-temper will only amuse us).
2305,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Pray just think how you took,"
2306,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And for fun, on a hook"
2307,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Soused us head over heels in the depths of the river,"
2308,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For the fishes to bite
2309,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Till we're washed away quite.
2310,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But the thought is enough to make any worm shiver.
2311,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But your sport
2312,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Is all caught,"
2313,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And 'tis our turn to tease.
2314,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,We can't hook
2315,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"You--but, look"
2316,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"You, you won't get much ease,"
2317,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For your ears we shall enter, and down your throat dive:"
2318,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Whilst, to make the most of you, as rivals we'll strive:"
2319,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But your bones will be left when we've finally done
2320,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,To be washed by the rain and made white by the sun.
2321,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Oh, revenge is a sweet and a delicate sauce,"
2322,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Which will sharpen our teeth should we chance feel remorse."""
2323,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Then a dark'ning shade o'er the victim's head,"
2324,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Like a tiny cloud or a sun-blind, spread,"
2325,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"While his brow was fanned by a gentle breeze,"
2326,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Which seemed to descend from the waving trees.
2327,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"'Twas a moment of bliss, till, lo! he saw"
2328,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"A pair of black wings and a darksome claw,"
2329,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Which pierced through his face where 'twas peeled and raw.
2330,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""O joyful,"" he thought, ""if this crow devours"
2331,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,The tormentors of these distracted hours!
2332,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Once rid of these plagues I could rot with ease;
2333,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"They tickle far worse than a thousand fleas!"""
2334,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But the carrion crows preferred hot meat
2335,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"To such reptile food, and began to eat,"
2336,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And piece after piece from his cheek they tore,--"
2337,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Such torture he felt he could scarce endure;
2338,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"So he said, ""Good crow, if you'll raise your claw,"
2339,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,No fish I'll entice from the cool stream more.
2340,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"The worms in their holes shall be safe, I'm sure;"
2341,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"While the dryest of crusts with pleasure I'll gnaw,"
2342,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And won't dream of a trout though I'm hungry sore."""
2343,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""We'll grant your request,"" said the crow; ""but mind,"
2344,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"If ever you fishing we chance to find,"
2345,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"If ever maltreating the smallest worm,"
2346,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Or to the least item prove aught but firm,"
2347,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"We'll soon all come back, and will with us bring"
2348,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,The adder to bite with his poisoned sting;
2349,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,The earwig on those dull brains to prey
2350,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Which scattered within your pate may stray;
2351,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"While your eyes I shall pick out as dainty food,"
2352,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"As a bit of a snack for my unfledged brood."""
2353,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Yes, he now has enough of experience bought"
2354,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,To teach him to give o'er such cruel sport.
2355,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"As thus spake the crow,"
2356,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Her wings to and fro
2357,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"She waved, and told the worms to go."
2358,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""He's our lawful prey,"
2359,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Now he's dead,"" said they:"
2360,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""He'll get so tough by a future day."""
2361,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But without a word more
2362,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,She uplifted her claw
2363,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And swept them all off from his face and breast.
2364,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,While the breath from her wings
2365,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Such happiness brings
2366,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"That, gaping and snoring, he sank to rest."
2367,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But 'twas short, though sweet, like a donkey's trot--"
2368,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"He woke, not refreshed, but dreadfully hot,"
2369,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"When he found why such visions his fancies fill,--"
2370,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,He had fallen asleep near an old ant hill.
2371,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And the ants while he slept
2372,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Had over him crept,"
2373,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Into his shoes,"
2374,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And down his neck;
2375,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Wherever they chose--
2376,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For little they reck
2377,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,What mischief they do:
2378,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Now the master's out,"
2379,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"They run each room through,"
2380,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And frolic about.
2381,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2382,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,The moisture they sip
2383,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"As they cross his lip,"
2384,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And where there's a wrinkle to bathe, they dip."
2385,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Then at hide and seek
2386,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,On his whisker'd cheek
2387,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,They frisk about;
2388,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But soon they all flit,"
2389,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"They've an order to quit,"
2390,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Their lease is out.
2391,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For he shook his old coat, though he greatly fears"
2392,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,He's only increasing the rent in arrears;
2393,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,While he stamped in his rage to destroy the nest
2394,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Of the vermin who dared to disturb his rest.
2395,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Now tow'rds the cot his steps were bent,"
2396,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"A-musing as he onward went,"
2397,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Though no bright thoughts amuse,"
2398,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Until soon his mind turned to the forthcoming treat:
2399,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Though the trout are too small, little fishes are sweet,"
2400,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And beggars their banquets mayn't choose.
2401,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Now he enters the door, when, instead of too late,"
2402,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"He discovers he has some few minutes to wait,"
2403,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For the fish are not done,"
2404,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,As the dame had to run
2405,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,To borrow a saucepan--as fluids retire
2406,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Through theirs, and will fret, and oft put out the fire."
2407,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But the pan was in use,"
2408,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,So the dame's tongue ran loose
2409,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"While she stayed to chat there, for best part of an hour,"
2410,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Of the state of affairs,"
2411,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Of the price of the shares,"
2412,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Or the politics secret of some foreign power.
2413,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But now quick as steam they are boiling away,"
2414,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Resolved to o'ertake--if not run down--delay;
2415,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"While Pat and young Matty are laying the cloth,"
2416,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And Sally to slumber is getting Mike off.
2417,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""They're but small ones to-day,"" said the dame, ""and I fear"
2418,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But a very poor dinner when drest they'll appear.
2419,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"I wish that our cupboard could aid your repast,"
2420,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But Pat of them sausages just ate the last."""
2421,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Now the truth is,"" said Peter, ""I numbers had caught,"
2422,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But I dug in my book till so buried in thought,"
2423,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"That soon rod, float, and line were by me heeded nought."
2424,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Though lots came so near
2425,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"My lecture to hear,"
2426,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"That one with my hand I nigh caught her,"
2427,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Those two I'd not took
2428,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But they bit at my hook
2429,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"As baitless it lay in the water."""
2430,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Oh, my ears must deceive me,"" said Sally, ""I'm sure."
2431,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Did you say your discourse to destruction would lure
2432,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Those who listen by chance to the words that you say,"
2433,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,In the place of at once getting out of the way?
2434,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But wait--let me think--'twas our book you were reading.
2435,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,No wonder you were not your rod and line heeding.
2436,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"We missed it soon after you left, but we guessed,"
2437,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"That p'rhaps of the two you might like it the best."""
2438,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2439,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Oh how Peter longed to give Pat a good poke!
2440,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But he knew that the dame saw no harm in a joke,"
2441,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And he feared lest his fish she might burn.
2442,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"So smiling he said, ""I another one sought,"
2443,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But here's your one back, which with me I brought,"
2444,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"As I wished it at once to return."""
2445,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,O Fiction! Miss Fiction! 'tis really too bad
2446,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Thus one monstrous lie to another to add,"
2447,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,As boys thread birds' eggs on a string.
2448,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But he much had to fear,"
2449,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"As you'll presently hear,"
2450,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,His punishment's now on the wing.
2451,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"The trout by this were cooked,"
2452,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And so temptingly looked
2453,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And smelt, they made Peter's mouth water;"
2454,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"While Pat's lips at the view,"
2455,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And Mike's little beak, too,"
2456,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Are moist--and the dame's, and both daughters'."
2457,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"(For the child is not sleepy, and won't his eyes close--"
2458,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"There are victuals a-cooking he very well knows,"
2459,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Which, if not wide awake, he does justly suppose"
2460,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"He shall lose, as provisions had run rather close.)"
2461,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Now the monk, nigh had offered the ladies a slice,"
2462,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But they looked, oh, so small! and they smelt, oh, so nice!"
2463,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,That he thought he could never have meant it.
2464,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For his maxim it was, ne'er an action to do"
2465,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,When there was the least chance in a moment or two
2466,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Of his finding good cause to repent it.
2467,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"So he said, ""You've all dined?"" and, as matter of course,"
2468,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"He soon sat himself down to concoct the fish sauce,"
2469,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,As he fancied he did it the best.
2470,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But of what it was made I ne'er heard, so can't tell,"
2471,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Though I'm certain the subject he'd studied right well,"
2472,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For the good dame its merits confest.
2473,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2474,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But he long had not been
2475,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Ere he fancied he'd seen
2476,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,The tail of a coat through the hedge flap.
2477,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""'Tis the Abbot,"" he thought,"
2478,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""And I now shall be caught,"
2479,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Like a frog or a toad in a rat-trap.
2480,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"In this cupboard I'll go,"
2481,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And mind, dame, you say 'No,'"
2482,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,If about me he happen to ask.
2483,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"'Tis really provoking,"
2484,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And far beyond joking!
2485,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"To evade him 's become quite a task."""
2486,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2487,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"O Conscience! how truly the proverb declares,"
2488,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,That Sin about with him his punishment bears.
2489,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Yea his shadow will scare him, and make his heart quake,"
2490,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"If, instead of the right, he another path take."
2491,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,He was scarcely concealed when a form the door darken'd.
2492,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Quick his eye to the keyhole was placed, while he hearken'd"
2493,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Who it was to find out, when he felt a sharp bite"
2494,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"At his leg, which gave him such a terrible fright"
2495,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"That he near had rushed out, ere he found he had been"
2496,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,On the cat and her kittens a-tumbling in.
2497,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But a voice his attention that moment arrested--
2498,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"'Tis a subject, perchance, in which he's interested."
2499,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"So once more his gaze pierced the keyhole right through,"
2500,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Where he had of the table an excellent view.
2501,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2502,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""How are you, my angel? Much pleasure it gives"
2503,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Me to see you! For your sake alone Murphy lives.
2504,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Though your beautiful charms all his brains are fast stealing,"
2505,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And his heart it would break did you hurt but a feeling.
2506,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Will you bless, then, your slave, by accepting of this"
2507,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Tiny gift of affection--a sweet wholesome kiss?
2508,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For, believe me, no onion I've tasted to-day,"
2509,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Though that delicate fruit's very much in my way.
2510,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,What!--you'd much rather not? Sure yourself you are spiting
2511,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Quite as much as myself, whom your charms are delighting."
2512,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Only think, what a way, for your sake I have brought it,"
2513,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And though numbers of females most anxiously sought it
2514,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"(Some too passably fair, yet--believe me, 'tis true,--"
2515,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,I met never a one so bewitching as you).
2516,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Still I kept my teeth close, though 'twas really perplexing"
2517,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Their sweet lips to see pouting, and gentle hearts vexing."
2518,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But come, Matty and Sal, you will kiss your new father,"
2519,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For I'm sure that your ma would say Yes than No, rather."
2520,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Though some cruel event has her peace of mind crossed,"
2521,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Still she's anxious to find the sweet temper she's lost.
2522,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And Pat, my fine fellow, how are you to-day?"
2523,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Here's sixpence to spend in some comical way.
2524,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Shall I give it your mother? she'll of it take care;
2525,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But whatever you buy give your sisters a share.
2526,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Stay, what is this nice smell? who has dinner not done?"
2527,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For I see by the cloth it is spread but for one:
2528,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Sure you never expected to see me!
2529,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For there seemed not a chance, when I got up to-day,"
2530,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Of my having the power to come round this way,"
2531,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Though I felt almost dying to see thee."""
2532,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Now the dame was perplexed;
2533,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,What to say or do next
2534,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,She certainly knew not.
2535,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,While the friar must choose
2536,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,His nice dinner to lose
2537,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,If quick out he flew not.
2538,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For the cover was raised,"
2539,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And the cooking was praised,"
2540,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,As the dame whisp'ring low said
2541,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""'Twas, dear Murphy, for you"
2542,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"They were dressed, for we knew"
2543,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,You would call as you so said
2544,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,The last time you were here;
2545,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And your welcome's sincere,"
2546,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Though they're small ones--I fear
2547,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Pat was sleepy or lazy,"
2548,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For the hot weather, says he"
2549,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Makes one take all things aisy."""
2550,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Oh, no mother, I aint. I was reading my book,"
2551,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"When, without any bait, they both snapt at my hook."
2552,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"I had nigh chucked them back they're so small, but I thought"
2553,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"You might think half a loaf perhaps better than naught."""
2554,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2555,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Now Murphy was sure there was either some hoax,"
2556,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Or young Pat was a-playing his practical jokes.
2557,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But he conscious seem'd not, for 'twas always his way"
2558,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"To entice them to words, which their thoughts would betray."
2559,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2560,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,[Illustration: Sure it makes me feel hungry.]
2561,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2562,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Well, Patrick, my boy, you're a fisherman clever!"
2563,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Such a dainty repast a monarch saw never;
2564,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Sure it makes me feel hungry, although I've just dined."
2565,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But as eating two dinners seems greedy inclined,"
2566,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,I will just call this tea; but I'm not such a baste
2567,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,As to eat all myself--you must each have a taste.
2568,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Come here, Mike, we're old friends, you must sit on my knee;"
2569,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And pray girls, get chairs, quick; they are near cold I see;"
2570,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For the time I should come your ma guessed so near right,"
2571,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,They were out of the pot ere I came within sight.
2572,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But pray what's this black stuff? Pat, you rogue, come confess,"
2573,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For I'm sure it was you made this horrible mess.
2574,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"What! 'tis fish-sauce, you say? 'Twill a source prove of pain,"
2575,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And will beckon the trout to your mouth back again."""
2576,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Now all are supplied,"
2577,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But when you divide
2578,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"What is small 'mong a number, there's not much a-piece."
2579,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"'Twas a sum, Murphy thought,"
2580,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,In division called short.
2581,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"He had multiplied rather, if they'd so increase."
2582,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But skill failed to contrive;--
2583,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,So the two into five
2584,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Went only just once and none over.
2585,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,While the girls from each other
2586,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Cast sly looks at their mother,"
2587,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Whose thoughts to the cupboard run over.
2588,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Shall we eat it or leave it? their eyes seemed to say,"
2589,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Quite forgetting that looks will their secrets betray.
2590,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"While in vain the poor dame may nod, frown, or may wink,"
2591,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For whatever she means they can none of them think.
2592,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2593,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Meanwhile the poor friar half stifled remains,"
2594,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And gives vent to his thoughts in the following strains:--
2595,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""O, cruel Miss Fortune, my dinner thus stealing!"
2596,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,I wish that I never had thought of concealing.
2597,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"O do spare but a tail for one mouthful, I pray thee!"
2598,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"I could relish roast jackass, without sauce or gravy,"
2599,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"I so hungry have got; while this cupboard's so close,"
2600,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,That I'm speckled with dew like a morn-gathered rose.
2601,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"I would quickly escape, if it were not for shame."
2602,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Let me see if I cannot some good excuse frame,"
2603,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,As a cure for this terrible fasting.
2604,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Can I make it appear that for something I've sought?
2605,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But, O dear me, I fear that I here shall find naught"
2606,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Save the cats and myself who just past in.
2607,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But, hark! some one's speaking--I'll hear what they're saying,"
2608,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,I may chance get off free by a moment's delaying.
2609,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""A delicious repast"
2610,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"This,"" said Murphy; ""when last"
2611,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,I was feasted on trout was in good O'Neal's time.
2612,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,I considered him then
2613,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Among wisest of men,"
2614,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Till he drowned him in drink, which I thought quite a crime."
2615,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For, pray, who in his senses would be after leaving"
2616,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Such a family sweet at his loss to be grieving?
2617,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Sure, though I am single, and have not much wealth,"
2618,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,I would give all the world for such treasures myself.
2619,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Now, dear Mistress O'Neal, you've a very snug home,"
2620,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,'Tis a thousand of pities you live all alone
2621,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,With no male to protect you. I know a young fellow
2622,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Who the place of your slave would supply very well. O
2623,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"He's just the right size; is not ugly, very."
2624,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Has a voice for a song; is lively and merry.
2625,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Can hedge, ditch, reap, and sow; can attend to a farm;"
2626,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,While his heart is so soft he a flea would not harm.
2627,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Then he dotes upon children, from Pat's age to Mike's,"
2628,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And those sweet babes of your'n are the sort that he likes.
2629,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Sure you'll take him at once on my recommendation;
2630,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For although he's ne'er been in a like situation,"
2631,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,He has made it his business to please all the ladies;
2632,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Ev'ry wish, although nonsense, directly obeyed is."""
2633,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Then her hands clasping tight, on his knees down he plumped,"
2634,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"(While the echoing walls cried to hear the floor thumped),"
2635,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Saying, ""Sweetest of angels! my darling! my deary!"
2636,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Do just listen a moment, I pray thee, and hear me."
2637,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For you know that of nectar you are the sweet essence,"
2638,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Those who fail to admire you, than none sure have less sense."
2639,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"'Tis myself is the slave in whose praise I was speaking,"
2640,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Who, when wedded to you, would be prouder than the king."
2641,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Then consent to be mine--dearest one, don't say No,"
2642,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Or I out of my senses shall certainly go."""
2643,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Now the good dame the whole,"
2644,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"From the depth of her soul,"
2645,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Believed----and her feelings could scarcely control
2646,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"(She, 'tis true, had preferred"
2647,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"That the monk had not heard,"
2648,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For where he was hid he must catch ev'ry word),"
2649,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But, much pleased altogether,"
2650,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,She was pondering whether
2651,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,To escape out of hearing if she could endeavour.
2652,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"So she said, ""Mr. Murphy, if outside you'll walk,"
2653,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"On the subject you've mentioned we'll have a short talk,"
2654,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Though I cannot afford a man-servant to keep--
2655,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"It would ruin me quite!"" But her plan was too deep"
2656,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For poor Murphy to guess; who, not knowing her reason,"
2657,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Thought she lov'd some one else, and despising such treason"
2658,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Cried, ""Oh, treat me not falsely; my love is most true,"
2659,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And I never will love any other than you.
2660,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Oh, I cannot thus leave you--I will not depart"
2661,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Till you say, 'I am thine!' thou delight of my heart!"
2662,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,O 'tis cruel to keep me thus long in suspense;
2663,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Your mistaking my meaning is all a pretence.
2664,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But you women delight so to bother and tease us,"
2665,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,When your study should be to make much of and please us;
2666,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Like an angler ere landing his fish plays about
2667,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Just for sport, when he knows he might pull him straight out."
2668,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But remember, there's many a good fish been lost"
2669,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"By the snap of a line, which a dinner has cost."""
2670,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""That is meant sure, for me,"" thought the friar; ""no doubt."
2671,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,How I wish the good dame could have coaxed the chap out!
2672,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For 'tis plain as my face, she's in love with the man;"
2673,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And he jealous may grow, while do all that I can"
2674,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,I much trouble may find in him undeceiving.
2675,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Those fellows are often so hard of believing!"""
2676,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2677,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But not long could poor Peter discov'ry put off,"
2678,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For he's all at once seized with a tickling cough,"
2679,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Which to strangle he tries, but in vain; though he pokes"
2680,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,His red fist in his mouth till he very nigh chokes;
2681,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For escape it would find, like a boiler of steam:"
2682,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Wherein water expands to such size that 'twould seem
2683,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"It must verily burst, when the safety-valve opes"
2684,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And the vapour unfettered from darkness elopes.
2685,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"So it was with the monk; had his cough not dispersed,"
2686,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Sure his lungs from the pressure had certainly burst.
2687,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2688,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Hush!"" said Murphy; ""what's that?"""
2689,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Oh, 'tis naught but the cat,"""
2690,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Said the dame, while her voice seemed confusing:"
2691,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""She has been there all day,"
2692,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And is most like at play
2693,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"With her kittens, who are so amusing."""
2694,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But the cough was repeated,"
2695,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And the dame felt defeated,"
2696,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,While quick Murphy tore open the door;
2697,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Crying, ""Come out, you sinner!"
2698,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Can such charms as yours win her,"
2699,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,While I love from my very heart's core?
2700,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But I'll make you pay dear
2701,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For thus listening here."""
2702,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And he raised up his foot for a kick.
2703,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"When the dame rushed between,"
2704,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Or a struggle there'd been
2705,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Which on hearing would turn your heart sick.
2706,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For, though choking, could Peter scarce utter a word,"
2707,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Of which Murphy enraged not a syllable heard,"
2708,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But he took up his hat to be gone.
2709,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""For your sake, dame, I spare"
2710,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"That old wretch, but take care"
2711,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,That I never him catch out alone.
2712,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For, as sure as I live,"
2713,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Such a hiding I'll give,"
2714,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"As shall make him feel sore in each bone."""
2715,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Then he turned on his heel and went out of the door;
2716,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"When, recov'ring his voice, Peter called to implore"
2717,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Him a moment to stop, as he wished to explain"
2718,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,How in such a position by chance he became.
2719,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Which as soon as I've done I shall surely expect"
2720,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"You'll apologize, too, for your want of respect."""
2721,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Murphy turned and re-turned,"
2722,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"With a frown sat him down,"
2723,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And a glance which bespoke great attention.
2724,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Sir, proceed; but take heed."
2725,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"To deceive, I believe"
2726,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Is your plan, and your present intention."""
2727,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"(But, alas! when a thing we much wish to be true,"
2728,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"We are apt to believe it is really so, too."
2729,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,So the news Murphy heard was so sweet to his ear
2730,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,That of present detection the monk had no fear.)
2731,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Hush, hush, unbeliever!"" the friar exclaimed;"
2732,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Such terms, in my presence, should ne'er once be named."
2733,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For of Mary's a monk I've the honour to be;
2734,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Which, if not so enraged, by my dress you might see."
2735,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Now although there's no reason why I should explain,"
2736,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Still, as 'tis for your good, if you choose to remain"
2737,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"I will tell all I know, when with pleasure you'll find,"
2738,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,That instead of a foe I am friendly inclined.
2739,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"First, your love from its source and beginning I've traced,"
2740,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Which on Widow O'Neal for her beauty was placed,"
2741,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Till the various graces which decked out her mind,"
2742,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,To obtain her esteem made you feel more inclined;
2743,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"While you felt in your heart you would rather have died,"
2744,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Than ere chance to behold her another man's bride.
2745,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Now, is it not so? Yes, I see by those eyes;"
2746,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"No wonder at first they are filled with surprise,"
2747,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"To hear me your thoughts and your actions disclose,"
2748,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But we monks know far more than you mortals suppose,"
2749,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And that what I affirm is correct, hear, and know,"
2750,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For the thoughts of your heart at this moment I'll show.
2751,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"You are thinking why I,"
2752,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"In a cupboard should fly,"
2753,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"As if of my actions ashamed,"
2754,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,When a dinner I'd got
2755,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Of nice trout, smoking hot."
2756,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,It looks as if I should be blamed.
2757,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But so certain I was, and convinced in my mind,"
2758,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"That the question to pop you felt strongly inclined,"
2759,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Which should make you despair, or else happy for life"
2760,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"(I just mean about making this good dame your wife),"
2761,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"That I thought I had better slip out of the way,"
2762,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Lest my presence might check what you wished so to say:
2763,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"It is true I regretted my dinner to lose,"
2764,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But to cross all my plans I at once did refuse;
2765,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For an in'trest I take
2766,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"In the match, for her sake,"
2767,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For I'm positive sure she a good wife will make.
2768,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And as now on that point you seem both resolved quite,"
2769,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"I am ready this moment your hands to unite,"
2770,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For your hearts by each other have long been held tight."""
2771,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Oh, forgive me! dear father,"" cried Murphy, with glee:"
2772,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"""Thus your acts to mistake, what a fool I must be!"
2773,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Sure your pardon I crave for the words that I might
2774,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"In my flurry have said, in the moment of fright;"
2775,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"It was catching you hid made me think all not right,"
2776,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But upon that head now I am satisfied quite.
2777,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Still I fear, though I'm anxious my fate to unite"
2778,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"With this beautiful dame, that it can't be to-night;"
2779,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For the dress is not bought which I meant to provide her,"
2780,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,And the friends are not asked she would fain have beside her.
2781,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Then, besides, there's not whisky enough in the house"
2782,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,To intoxicate more than a newly-weaned mouse:
2783,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"But the day after next, if my charmer is willing,"
2784,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"I will snap, for her eyes are than fish-hooks more killing."
2785,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Oh, then say, dearest, say,"
2786,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Will it suit you that day,"
2787,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,From O'Neal into Murphy to change?
2788,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But if you would delay
2789,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,I will cheerful obey--
2790,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For I would not your plans disarrange."""
2791,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2792,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Now the widow scarce knew
2793,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"What on earth she should do,"
2794,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"There was nothing, she thought, to prevent it;"
2795,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And although she had rather have been all alone,"
2796,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Than the state of her heart 'fore another to own,"
2797,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Still refusing he might think she meant it.
2798,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And the chance would be gone,"
2799,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Which her hopes had upborne,"
2800,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,For a twelvemonth and some few days more.
2801,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"So she said, ""If you please, sir, I find on reflection,"
2802,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"That I really have not got the slightest objection,"
2803,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,But I could not be ready before;
2804,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For a bit of a party we must have at night,"
2805,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"As there's many I've promised I would then invite,"
2806,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Who, neglected, would feel very sore."
2807,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"I should next week have liked, but had rather a fear"
2808,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"That with washing or baking it might interfere,"
2809,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"So we'll make it the day you wished for."""
2810,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2811,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"She had scarcely said this,"
2812,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,When a good hearty kiss
2813,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Flew plump on her lips ripe as cherry;
2814,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,While an arm round her waist
2815,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"At the moment was placed,--"
2816,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,She did not dislike it much very.
2817,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"Then the friar took leave,"
2818,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,While the good people grieve
2819,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,That he of his meal was bereft;
2820,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"For he'd not been the least fed,"
2821,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Though in fancy he feasted
2822,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,(As that now was all that was left)
2823,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"On the banquet to come,"
2824,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,When he'd surely make one
2825,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,Of the guests on the grand bridal day:
2826,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"When right good farm-house cheer,"
2827,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"With prime ale and strong beer,"
2828,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,"And proof whisky, would make all hearts gay."
2829,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2830,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,*       *       *       *       *
2831,_CHAPTER THE FOURTH._,
2832,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._
2833,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
2834,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"'Twas a day of days,"
2835,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And birds to its praise
2836,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Their very best lays
2837,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Sung out.
2838,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"While the sheep and cows,"
2839,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Who their carols rouse
2840,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"O'er the meadows, browse"
2841,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,About.
2842,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Not a cloud was seen
2843,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,The bright sun between
2844,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And the pastures green,"
2845,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,When forth
2846,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"The good widow crept,"
2847,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Who had scarcely slept,"
2848,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Though 'twas bright thoughts kept
2849,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Sleep off.
2850,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"She was up with the sun,"
2851,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"As there's much to be done,"
2852,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And great numbers of things to provide
2853,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,For the grand bridal meal
2854,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"(Ere her fate she may seal),"
2855,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,But in showing her skill feels much pride.
2856,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"There's the butter to make,"
2857,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"All the new bread to bake,"
2858,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And a very large plum-cake beside;
2859,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,While she'd think with much dread
2860,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,She's not properly wed
2861,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,If aught ill to that cake should betide.
2862,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Yea, she has quite a doubt"
2863,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,If a marriage without
2864,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Would be legal, if lawyers it tried."
2865,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
2866,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Now Jonas the miller (her uncle) for dower
2867,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Had sent her a sack of the best wheaten flour;
2868,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"So on tarts, puddings, pies, she may work away fast"
2869,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"As she likes, for materials her time out will last."
2870,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
2871,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,She is rambling now
2872,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"To look after the cow,"
2873,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Who of course to a distance would stray.
2874,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"But she did not get cross,"
2875,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Though of time thus there's loss,"
2876,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,For p'rhaps Murphy might chance come that way.
2877,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"He had toiled away fast,"
2878,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"For the day or two past,"
2879,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,To make the house fit for his bride.
2880,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"As he felt quite inclined,"
2881,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And had made up his mind,"
2882,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,That there 'twould be best to reside.
2883,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
2884,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Sure this morning he's late,"""
2885,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Thought the dame, as a gate"
2886,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"She approached which led into a lane,"
2887,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,When a voice loud in song
2888,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Was heard strolling along;
2889,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Oh, she thought it a beautiful strain!"
2890,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Oh, my love she is merry,"
2891,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And beautiful, very;"
2892,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Her lips are as red as a ripe juicy cherry.
2893,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
2894,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Her neck than snow's whiter,"
2895,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Her eyes than stars brighter,"
2896,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Her step than the gentle gazelle's is far lighter.
2897,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
2898,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Her fine sculptured nose is"
2899,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Surrounded with roses,"
2900,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And tulips, whose sweetness fresh beauty discloses."
2901,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
2902,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Than the lark her voice sweeter,"
2903,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Yea, so perfect 's each feature,"
2904,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"She is without doubt a most beautiful creature."""
2905,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
2906,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Oh, good morning, dear Murphy,"" the dame cried with pleasure,"
2907,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"As she stept into sight when he finished the measure,"
2908,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""A most beautiful song that, and sung with much feeling;"
2909,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Quite enraptured, all care from my heart it seemed stealing,"
2910,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Like the music of birds, which will sometimes come creeping"
2911,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"O'er our dreams in that state betwixt waking and sleeping."""
2912,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Ah, you've listening been! I myself have betrayed,"
2913,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And the praises you've heard of a beautiful maid.
2914,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Now, as oft I've heard said by those proverb-wise elves,"
2915,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"That sly listeners never hear good of themselves,"
2916,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,It could ne'er have been you to whose praise I sung out:
2917,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"But I see by that smile that there lingers a doubt,"
2918,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And you still think 'tis you from the kind of description.
2919,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Well, 'tis true you seem made after such a prescription;"
2920,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"But it does not do justice, as I can assure ye."
2921,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"I'll remand you till eve, when assemble the jury,"
2922,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And then if this gown that I've bought you'll appear in,"
2923,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,The verdict of guilty I'm certain of hearing:
2924,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"For all of your guests will of envy be dying,--"
2925,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"The women, because you their charms are out-vieing;"
2926,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"The men, 'cause I've won you while vain they were trying."""
2927,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Then on they walked,"
2928,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And blithely talked
2929,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Of happiness in store.
2930,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,The cow soon caught
2931,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Was homeward brought,--"
2932,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Her rambling days are o'er;
2933,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"For Murphy all the hedges patched,"
2934,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"The wicket swung and firmly latched,"
2935,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,As it had hung before.
2936,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,The rotten roof with great dispatch
2937,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Received an outer coat of thatch,"
2938,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,While boards soon frame a door.
2939,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And time he in the garden found
2940,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"To sort the bed from paths around,"
2941,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And with the weeds wage war.
2942,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Meanwhile the hours onward rolled,"
2943,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"The clock the time had often told,"
2944,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"The dame her cooking had completed,"
2945,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"The pots and pans had all retreated,"
2946,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"The house in ev'ry point seemed righted,"
2947,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Naught's out of place but those invited,"
2948,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Just to witness the sticking of two soles together,"
2949,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Tight as e'er gutta percha has stuck unto leather.
2950,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Now although 'tis not late
2951,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"The dame likes not to wait,"
2952,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,It puts her in such a great fidget;
2953,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,There is nothing to do
2954,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"She can put her hand to,"
2955,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Or her fever would crawl to each digit.
2956,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,The fair maidens for hours
2957,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Had been decking with flow'rs
2958,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"The kitchen, and made it look gay"
2959,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,As a ribbon-clad sweep
2960,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Who from chimneys may creep
2961,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,To dance round a green (first of May).
2962,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"'Tis a quarter to five,"
2963,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And the guests fast arrive,"
2964,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And each with him some present brings:
2965,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"One a roast pig had got,"
2966,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"One a goose smoking hot,"
2967,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And numbers of other nice things.
2968,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"There were rabbits and hares,"
2969,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And prime roast-ducks in pairs,"
2970,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And pigeons delightfully cooked.
2971,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Like a pic-nic it seemed,"
2972,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,But might well have been deemed
2973,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"A banquet, so noble it looked."
2974,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,But a fear rising lest
2975,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Some nice girl might like best
2976,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"To hear how the bride than the victuals were dress'd,"
2977,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"In few words I'll express,"
2978,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Although feminine dress
2979,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Is out of my line I must really confess;
2980,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"For when I've had a look, it"
2981,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Has but been to hook it,--"
2982,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,I never then thought I might chance have to book it.
2983,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,So I beg you'll excuse
2984,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Me if strange terms I use,--"
2985,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Such a trifling request you will scarcely refuse.
2986,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
2987,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Now the gown Murphy gave her,"
2988,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"That expense he might save her,"
2989,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Though not quite bran new, still looked elegant rather,"
2990,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Of a sky-coloured blue,"
2991,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Without flounces, 'tis true,"
2992,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And being scanty in skirt rather tight round her drew;
2993,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"It was smothered with bows,"
2994,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Which descended in rows
2995,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"From her fine swelling chest to her neat little toes,"
2996,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Just like scarlet-runners,--"
2997,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Love, sure, they had won hers,"
2998,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,If at the beginning had been but for fun hers.
2999,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"At the top it was low,"
3000,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"That her neck it might show,"
3001,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,As white as a turnip or two-days'-back snow.
3002,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Then her rather red face
3003,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Was embedded in lace,"
3004,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"With large green rosette, garnished to heighten each grace."
3005,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,But a bright crimson shawl
3006,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Was her pride above all,"
3007,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Whose folds graceful descended the ground down to fall.
3008,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3009,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,The young ladies in white
3010,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Will appear towards night,"
3011,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Their frocks from the mangle are not yet dry quite.
3012,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"So like _grubs_ they appear,"
3013,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Till through starching they're clear,"
3014,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And then prouder than _butterflies_ up their heads rear.
3015,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,With sweet roses entwined
3016,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"They their fair brows will bind,"
3017,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,To make most of themselves they are really inclined.
3018,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3019,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Little Michael was drest
3020,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Out in his very best,"
3021,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"With a pinafore over, lest they might be messed."
3022,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"He had watched with great int'rest the good things provided,"
3023,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And much longed for the time when they should be divided.
3024,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3025,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""O you beautiful creature!"" said Flannagan Ted,"
3026,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""How I wish it was me, and not Murphy instead;"
3027,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"I quite think we must fight till there's one of us kilt,"
3028,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Unless he runs away that no blood may be spilt."""
3029,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Oh, the false, faithless man!"" cried a beauty beside him;"
3030,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""When I thought him so true, sure his words have belied him!"
3031,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"To speak so in my presence,--oh, really, 'tis shocking!"
3032,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,How often do men seem our best feelings mocking!'
3033,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"But the good dame replied, with a kind-hearted smile,"
3034,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""'Twas but flattery, Clare, his heart's your's all the while."""
3035,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Yet the beautiful maid still continued to pout,"
3036,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Till a loud, smacking kiss, rubbed the wrinkles all out."
3037,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3038,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Look! there's old Farmer Jonas arrived in his cart,"
3039,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"With a pair of twin daughters and wife dressed so smart,"
3040,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Whose plump cheeks are so covered with ribbons and bows,"
3041,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,That like owl from out ivy appears each peak'd nose.
3042,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"That the maidens were fair is a fib I can't tell you,"
3043,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And, what was most strange, 'twas a fact they both well knew,"
3044,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"For their eyes tow'rds each other were friendly inclined,"
3045,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,While their locks would bring carrots at once to your mind.
3046,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"But their tempers were sweet as the extract of bees,"
3047,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And where'er they might go they were certain to please.
3048,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"The old farmer himself is a jovial fellow,"
3049,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"With a loud, pealing laugh, as melodious and mellow"
3050,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,As the music of calves when for mammy they bellow.
3051,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"In stature he's stumpy, approaching to fat,"
3052,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"With a very broad face and a still broader hat,"
3053,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Which, perched all on one side, like an avalanche sat;"
3054,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And so brightly would twinkle his little black eyes
3055,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"(When he uttered his jokes, which would often arise)"
3056,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,That like di'monds they gleamed of first water and size.
3057,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3058,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"His good lady, however, was quite his reverse,--"
3059,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"She was scraggy and lanky, and, what was far worse,"
3060,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"For ever was teased with a terrible cough,"
3061,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,That threatened each moment to carry her off.
3062,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3063,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Now old Jonas was richer than any around,"
3064,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"He'd a farm and a mill--besides acres of ground,"
3065,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Where the ripe, waving corn, like an ocean appears,"
3066,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,While than even King Midas he boasts longer ears;
3067,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And like to that fabulous monarch of old,"
3068,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Whatever he touch'd was transformed into gold.
3069,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"No harm to his horses there ever befel,"
3070,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And his cattle had never at all felt unwell.
3071,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"His crops were all good, and increased fast his store;--"
3072,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Thus contented he lives, nor once wishes for more."
3073,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,By all ranks he is held in the greatest esteem;
3074,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Which is justly his due, as will presently seem,"
3075,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"For his house, always open, scarce wanted a door,"
3076,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And was styled a depôt for the wants of the poor.
3077,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3078,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Dear Uncle, to see you it gives me much pleasure,"
3079,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"The present you sent me was really a treasure,"""
3080,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"The young widow exclaimed, as a kiss on her brow"
3081,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Was descending, as light as a bird on a bough."
3082,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Dearest Aunt and sweet cousins, I felt it most kind,"
3083,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"That the state of my wardrobe you still kept in mind,"
3084,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"For without those fair garments, though hidden from view,"
3085,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,I had sorely been puzzled whatever to do:
3086,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"They're a beautiful fit, though the hooks will not meet;"
3087,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Still the gown fastened over them keeps all things neat."""
3088,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3089,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Now they all are arrived but the bridegroom and priest,"
3090,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,But of guests at a wedding they form not the least;
3091,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And the dame gets more anxious her true love to see,"
3092,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Who had left to adorn, but had promised to be"
3093,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Back in less than no time--but his word had not kept.
3094,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"She was angry and vexed, and had certainly wept,"
3095,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"But she would not her friends should suppose her infirm,"
3096,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And so tries to explain why he does not return.
3097,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Which, while she is doing, I'll try and describe"
3098,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,The friends of the bridegroom as well as the bride.
3099,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,There is Jerry Maguire
3100,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"(Who has brought, by desire,"
3101,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"His fiddle to strike up a dance),"
3102,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"He has long, curly hair,"
3103,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Which delights ev'ry fair,"
3104,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Who at him oft cast a sly glance.
3105,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"He is not very tall,"
3106,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Yet looks down upon all,"
3107,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And considers himself just the thing,"
3108,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"In his rough, white frock coat,"
3109,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Green cravat round his throat,"
3110,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And broad collar turned down o'er each wing.
3111,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,His young sister's there too
3112,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"(Quite a picture to view),"
3113,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"A sweet, rosy-cheeked, plump, little maid,"
3114,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Who appears rather shy,"
3115,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And will cast down her eye
3116,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"When she's spoke to, as if she's afraid."
3117,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Close beside her there sat,"
3118,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Full of kind, friendly chat,"
3119,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Her young cousins, the Misses Delhay,"
3120,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"With their big brother Sam,"
3121,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Who, quite certain I am,"
3122,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Is in love with Maguire's sister May.
3123,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"For attention he paid her,"
3124,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Such presents oft made her,"
3125,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And ever was close by her side,"
3126,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"While the mother oft winks,"
3127,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,When she's asked how she thinks
3128,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Pretty May would look dressed like a bride.
3129,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"In a corner remote,"
3130,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Where each look she may note,"
3131,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"At this very moment she's sitting,"
3132,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And attention scarce pays
3133,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"To what old Jonas says,"
3134,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Who is rather fidgetty getting.
3135,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"For she scarcely had spoke,"
3136,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Though a pun and a joke
3137,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,On the bride and the wedding he made;
3138,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"So for fear they'd be lost,"
3139,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"He uprose--the room crossed,"
3140,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And them safe to the widow conveyed;
3141,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Who said, ""Dear me, how funny!"" and laughed till she cried"
3142,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"With a fit of convulsions, which nigh cracked her side"
3143,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,(As a prelude to draw all attention).
3144,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""I must tell it them, uncle, although you say nay."""
3145,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""And screw up your dear mouth in that comical way?"""
3146,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""'Tis is a great deal too good not to mention."""
3147,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3148,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""I've a riddle to ask, though against me the jest,--"
3149,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Why are you all betrayed, and not one e'er a guest?"
3150,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"What, can none of you guess? Why, through those who so late are,"
3151,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"There is nowhere a guest, for each person's a waiter!"""
3152,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""What a dreadful bad pun!"" whispered Samuel Delhay,"
3153,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,As his red lips approached nigh the ear of fair May;
3154,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"But perceiving he's watched, he could do nothing more,"
3155,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Than just smile for a moment, and them back withdraw."
3156,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3157,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"But I now must return without further delay,"
3158,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,To describe all the guests of the grand wedding day.
3159,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"There is tall Miss O'Riley,"
3160,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,In a queerish old style she
3161,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Appears to be made; by the cut of her phiz
3162,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Though a spinster,--'tis sure,"
3163,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,She can flirting endure;
3164,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Her age when truth calculates right is
3165,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Forty--but, O dear me, pray what am I about?"
3166,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,I shall get by the fair sex kicked certainly out;
3167,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"I should only have said what is true, by the bye,"
3168,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,That though out of her teens she has ne'er got a tie.
3169,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3170,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"But pray who is that beauty of very great size,"
3171,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Who can't sit on one chair though she struggling tries,"
3172,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"With large gooseberry eyes, and complexion as sallow"
3173,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,As a half-melted dip of inferior tallow?
3174,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"By her beak her I know, which is long and red, rather--"
3175,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,She is spouse to the man who is Flanagan's father.
3176,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3177,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Now, O'Flanagan's self is as brown as a berry,"
3178,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Tallish, stout-built, ferocious, and fightable, very;"
3179,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"For no fray could you name in which he hadn't been,"
3180,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,While where'er he may go his shillaly is seen
3181,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Tucked under his arm, whence in less than a minute"
3182,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"It would leap to his hand, and deal blows ere quite in it."
3183,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"He is partial to racing, to gambling, to liquor,"
3184,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Can the value of horses than dealers tell quicker;
3185,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Can run, wrestle, and fight, any man in the village,"
3186,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And, when safe from detection, objects not to pillage;"
3187,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"I don't housebreaking mean, but just causing a sheep"
3188,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"To have unpleasant dreams, and to walk in its sleep."
3189,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Now, although much disliked by most people, yet still,"
3190,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Go wherever you may, there you certainly will"
3191,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Meet O'Flanagan John--though he's only invited
3192,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Just to keep his wrath cool, which oft boils when he's slighted;"
3193,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And like steam must find vent in some malice-fraught trick,"
3194,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Or will burst into flame like a smould'ring rick.
3195,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"His son, Flanagan Ted, is a nice little feller,"
3196,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"At least, so says Clare--and pray, who should know weller?"
3197,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"He is tall, handsome, well-made, and folks say they never"
3198,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Have beheld a young man more polite, or so clever."
3199,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Near, of course, to his side,"
3200,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Sat his young future bride,"
3201,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Who seems much inclined to be jealous.
3202,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Speaks he but to another,"
3203,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"She her thoughts can scarce smother,"
3204,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,And sighs like a pair of new bellows.
3205,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Her old father and brother are somewhere about,--"
3206,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"With O'Flanagan talking, I have not a doubt,"
3207,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Of the state of the crops, for of him land they rent,"
3208,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"(Not, p'rhaps, over well-tilled, but of wondrous extent),"
3209,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Near O'Flanagan Lodge, which are fixed by entail,"
3210,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Or, through winds often raised, they ere now had set sail."
3211,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Now O'Donoghue senior's a cunning, shrewd man,"
3212,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Who had sketched out his life to the following plan:--
3213,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Just take care of your money when once, 'tis obtained;"
3214,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"For a penny when saved is a penny well gained."""
3215,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"He is short, ugly, shrivelled, and bowed down with care;"
3216,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"What is styled a spare man, or a man all could spare."
3217,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"He is harsh, much despised by the people around,"
3218,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,For the lab'rers in him a severe master found.
3219,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"And the poor never called, for they knew 'twas no use,"
3220,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,As he gave naught away but a show'r of abuse.
3221,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,It was not quite respect made him seek for his daughter
3222,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Such a partner for life, but he wisely had taught her"
3223,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,His favourite maxim of--Get all you can;
3224,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,For 'tis money alone manufactures the man.
3225,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3226,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Young O'Donoghue, too,"
3227,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Is a bit of a screw,"
3228,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,For he wears an old coat which has never been new.
3229,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"The plain English of which is,"
3230,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"That, in spite of their riches,"
3231,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,'Twas a pair and a half of his father's old breeches.
3232,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,He has shouldered two legs--for the tails split another;
3233,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,While his back took a seat which his neck too will cover.
3234,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3235,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Now they're all introduced but a queer little man,"
3236,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"With broad nose, bushy hair, and complexion like tan;"
3237,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Who a foreigner seems, quite a fresh importation,"
3238,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,An exotic transplanted from some foreign nation.
3239,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3240,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""But what has delayed them?"""
3241,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Uncle Jonas exclaimed;
3242,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Some harm has waylaid them;"
3243,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Or they're to be blamed.
3244,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,For I hoped ere this time to have given away
3245,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"This good dame, who I fear on my hands still must stay."
3246,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"I bestowed her before, but just like a bad penny"
3247,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"She returns to my pocket, though welcome as any."
3248,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,For of her and the children it must be allowed
3249,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"I with justice have reason to be truly proud."""
3250,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""We had better begin,"
3251,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Food thus spoilt becomes sin,"""
3252,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Exclaimed Flanagan John, with a ravenous grin;"
3253,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""For, believe when I say,"
3254,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Scarce a toothful to-day
3255,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"I have eat, that I honour to all things might pay."
3256,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"I now too feel quite sinking,"
3257,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,While I cannot help thinking
3258,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"They've mistook the day."" He continued by winking;"
3259,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,When his speech was cut short by a loud joyful shout
3260,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"From young Patrick O'Neal, who had kept the look-out."
3261,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Here is Murphy a-coming! Hurrah! hurrah!"
3262,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Our mother's young husband! Our handsome new Pa!"""
3263,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3264,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Oh, I'm covered with blushes, one heap of confusion;"
3265,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Sure to pop in so late appears quite an intrusion.
3266,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"But I thought of a proverb which Truth conveys over,"
3267,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Which says, 'Coming, though late, is still better than never.'"
3268,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"But you all will forgive, my excuse when you've heard--"
3269,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Yet just now on that subject I'll speak not a word;
3270,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,I've delayed you too long--for the present at least.
3271,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"When you're fed, I'll tell all. But, pray, where is the priest?"
3272,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,I can't see his dear face. What! forgotten to call?
3273,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Oh then, sure, by good luck, I'm not last after all."""
3274,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,
3275,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Oh,"" said Jonas, ""like you"
3276,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,He some excuse too
3277,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Most likely will give us for coming so late.
3278,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"But as hunger grows stronger,"
3279,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"We will tarry no longer,"
3280,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"For hunger will not for a priest even wait."""
3281,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"""Stay, for him I'll atone,"
3282,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"'Tis no fault of his own,"""
3283,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,Said Murphy; I'm certain he'd choose
3284,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"(From the little I know),"
3285,_CHAPTER THE FIFTH._,"Through great dangers to go,"

3436,_CHAPTER THE SIXTH._,Who with clubs dashed their brains out to manure the ground.
3437,_CHAPTER THE SIXTH._,"And, thus, ever since (to these animals' shame)"
3438,_CHAPTER THE SIXTH._,"They made beasts of themselves,--Beast has been their name."

3442,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._
3443,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3444,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As 'tis likely all this
3445,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"You will skip o'er and miss,"
3446,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As remote from the subject before ye;
3447,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,I a few facts will lay
3448,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now before you, which may"
3449,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Form excuse for this turn of the story.
3450,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"First, I think it is rude to remark what folks eat,"
3451,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,So I mended my pen while they cut up the meat;
3452,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And this tale copied out, which I thought might apply"
3453,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To events that were passing close under my eye.
3454,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But my strain I'll resume when they come to dessert,"
3455,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And will note down their jokes, which no feelings can hurt."
3456,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For who'd like a reporter on paper with ink
3457,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To note all that you eat, and write down what you drink?"
3458,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Of the number of slices it takes you to fill?
3459,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Just as if he of parcels was making a bill!
3460,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"No, although--like all authors--I know each one's taste;"
3461,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"What they thought, too; yea, dream't! still I will not now waste"
3462,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Your time or your patience by piece-meal retailing
3463,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Who in this capacity showed greatest of feeling.
3464,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Suffice it to say, like the beasts in the fable,"
3465,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,They tucked in the victuals as long as they're able;
3466,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then applied to the bottle to fill up the chinks,"
3467,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,While each mouth to the bridegroom and would-be bride drinks.
3468,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""And now, pray, Mr. Murphy, we'll have your excuse;"
3469,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"No excuse to get off, sir, you'll find of much use,"""
3470,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Uncle Jonas exclaimed, as he shook his old head,"
3471,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Just to make it appear he knew more than he said.
3472,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Here's my niece has but eaten the third of a dinner,--"
3473,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Oh, this love it will make e'en the fattest one thinner!"
3474,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"She seems vexed with us all, p'rhaps with you not the least,"
3475,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though I rather believe it is most with the priest."""
3476,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3477,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Well,"" said Murphy, ""I meant through the forest to run"
3478,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To look out for old Peter, when dinner was done."
3479,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But before I set out I will frankly declare
3480,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"What detained me so late, though 'tis quite an affair"
3481,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Of a delicate nature----wait--p'rhaps it's best not
3482,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To go talking about it--'tis better forgot--
3483,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"She may think it unmanly, unjust, or unkind"
3484,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"If I spread it abroad, so you please must not mind"
3485,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"These few words I've just said; I'll be back here ere long,"
3486,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And will favour you then with a comical song."""
3487,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Oh, oh!"" said the farmer, and glanced a sly wink;"
3488,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""There's some gal in the gale then, you'd have us to think."
3489,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"We shall soon have a breeze, and a tempest will blow,"
3490,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,If what's up in the wind you don't presently show.
3491,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Pray be seated, there is no such great haste for the priest,"
3492,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Till we're satisfied all on this subject at least.
3493,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"What! oh, dear me! quick--water, she's fainting away!"""
3494,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"He cried out, as the dame 'gainst his arm her head lay."
3495,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"While he knew, by the bye, just as much what to do,"
3496,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As a pig does of making an Irish stew.
3497,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""No, no, brandy is better!"" O'Flanagan said;"
3498,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Raise her head!"" whispered Clare. ""Lay her down here!"" said Ted."
3499,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Here's my salts,"" said Miss Riley, who twice had searched o'er"
3500,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Both her pockets, then strewed the contents on the floor."
3501,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Or some vinegar, p'rhaps, if applied to her brow"
3502,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Might her senses revive, which seem slumbering now,"""
3503,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Exclaimed Mrs. Maguire; ""poor, dear thing! she, indeed,"
3504,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Must have ate or drank something which has disagreed."""
3505,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Warm her feet,"" said Miss Delhay; ""and loosen her dress;"
3506,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"If took out in the air she'd be better, I guess."""
3507,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Said her aunt, Mrs. Jonas, ""Come, Murphy, lead her;"
3508,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And, Patrick, you run for a doctor to bleed her."""
3509,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Oh, the wretch that I am! what a baste of a feller"
3510,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Thus to tease her to death, when I might as well tell her."
3511,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,It's no fault of my own if the girls will admire.
3512,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Sure I cannot look ugly because I desire?
3513,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Oh, pray come to, my dearest! my angel, revive!"
3514,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Do but squeeze out a smile, just to show you're alive."
3515,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"If you're not quite well soon, and my folly forgive,"
3516,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I shall ne'er more be happy as long as I live."""
3517,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then she opened her eyes, cast them down to the ground,"
3518,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Rolled them slowly about, and in tones most profound"
3519,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Said, ""There's not much the matter, I only was grieving"
3520,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For fear that dear Murphy had been a-deceiving.
3521,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But I'm much better now, and quite able to hear"
3522,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"What he wished to explain when I first was took queer."""
3523,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Oh, the wiles of the fair sex! What tricks they will try"
3524,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To beguile us poor men! With a tear in their eye
3525,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"They can crush Opposition without e'er a word,"
3526,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though he wear a long tongue, and is armed with a sword."
3527,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Yea, kingdoms have crumbled, washed away by a tear--"
3528,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,A deep sigh sent an army to a premature bier.
3529,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Twice a kiss has released condemned captives from death;
3530,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,While a frown often robs from a hero his breath.
3531,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Many heads once were broke when Meg Dogharty cried,"
3532,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And fair Chloe won lovers whenever she sighed.
3533,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And pray who has not felt the sweet force of a smile
3534,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Your heart from you stealing, though on guard all the while,"
3535,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"All your senses o'er-turning, and making your brain"
3536,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Like a teetotum spun by Miss Pleasure and Pain?
3537,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But the brute of a man who can firmly persist
3538,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"'Gainst the feminine tear and a sigh to resist,"
3539,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Leaves the fair one no weapons to urge her complaint
3540,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But to go in hysterics, or have a good faint."
3541,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3542,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But stop, pray where am I? I've been straying again!"
3543,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That I'm quite off my beat appears perfectly plain.
3544,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Like the dog I take with me when walking about,"
3545,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Who will run down each turning, first in and then out."
3546,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Thus, when but three miles past 'neath these two feet of mine,"
3547,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,I am certain his four feet have traversed o'er nine;
3548,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So this quill of wild goose, if the straight path it went,"
3549,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Might save more of your patience than thirty per cent.
3550,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3551,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Well,"" said Murphy, ""you know,"" (and his fair bride he placed"
3552,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"In a chair, while he bustled his arm round her waist;"
3553,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But perceiving a sore throat blow in at the door,"
3554,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,He just twisted his arm round her neck like a boa.)
3555,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Well,"" he said; ""you know""--but he could not get farther."
3556,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Oh, truly, the subject seems delicate rather."
3557,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Stop, 'tis really too bad thus your time to be wasting,"
3558,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,When I'm sure the sweet whisky you'd be after tasting.
3559,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"'Tis a beautiful spirit, will cure melancholy;"
3560,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And can make even grief to look pleasant and jolly."""
3561,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then continued he thus, in a still lower tone,"
3562,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Dearest! Much-better-half, 'tis no fault of my own,"
3563,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But I'd rather explain to yourself quite alone."""
3564,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""No, no, no!"" cried each voice; ""we will have it, sir, now."""
3565,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And they clapped, stamped, and made such a terrible row,"
3566,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That poor Murphy soon saw he no rest there should find
3567,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Till confessed, so thus spoke forth in accents resigned."
3568,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Well my friends, you must know,"
3569,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,About eight years ago
3570,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,I first went as a lad to old Donolly's farm;
3571,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Where I've been ever since,"
3572,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And, the truth not to mince,"
3573,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Am thought well-behaved, clever, and quite free from harm."
3574,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now of girls he has two,"
3575,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Pretty fair ones to view,"
3576,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,With such figures I'm sure can surpassed be by none.
3577,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But they both of them thought
3578,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"(Which their eyes soon me taught),"
3579,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That I'd make for their father an excellent son.
3580,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Now what could a man do?
3581,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"He can't marry wives two,"
3582,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And in truth I myself wanted neither.
3583,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So I hunted about,"
3584,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And a lover found out,"
3585,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Whom I gave a broad hint might have either.
3586,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But the other poor girl would each offer refuse,"
3587,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Till the young man decided 'twas worse than no use
3588,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To solicit her hand, and considered it mine,"
3589,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Though I two or three times did the honour decline;
3590,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then her father had made up his mind I should do,"
3591,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,While poor Joan on that point seemed quite satisfied too;
3592,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though I never the slightest encouragement gave,"
3593,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But was only polite--as I always behave.
3594,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I can but remember one time that I kissed her,"
3595,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And then sure the pleasure was shared by her sister.
3596,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Just of late, since I fixed on this dame for my bride,"
3597,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I have fled from her presence, and ever have tried"
3598,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To show plain as might be--though I could not be rude--
3599,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"That her love was misplaced, and would prove of no good."
3600,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now I lived in the house, and you'll therefore suppose"
3601,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"That she saw I was fed, and looked after my clothes;"
3602,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Sewing on truant buttons, and giving a darn"
3603,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To the rents--for that stitching I never could learn.
3604,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now it happened to-day,"
3605,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That I happened to say
3606,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That p'rhaps it might happen I should be away;
3607,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For some old friends of mine
3608,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Had just asked me to dine
3609,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To give my opinion on some foreign wine.
3610,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To m' Sarah, m' deary, of course I alluded,"
3611,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And though speaking a figure of speech only true did.
3612,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But the maiden appeared
3613,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As if something she feared;
3614,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And, somehow--I cannot tell why,"
3615,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I felt quite nervous too,"
3616,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And tried all I could do
3617,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To shun the sad turn of her eye.
3618,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now I told you she took of my raiment the care,"
3619,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,So I mentioned I wanted my best clothes to wear.
3620,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,When--can you believe it?--she would not give them out
3621,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"She declared, till I told her what I was about."
3622,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"There was something not right she could readily see,"
3623,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And she ne'er did expect such behaviour from me.
3624,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"One she much had respected and highly esteemed,"
3625,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Till my manner of late, which quite bearish she deemed"
3626,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Well, I tried all I knew"
3627,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"(While I thought, love, of you),"
3628,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To escape from her questions by no means a few.
3629,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But I found each plan vain,"
3630,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Till at length I spoke plain,--"
3631,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"'Then know, I am going a fair bride to obtain.'"
3632,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"'O the monster! the wretch!' she exclaimed with such fury,"
3633,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"That I'm sure any justice and impartial jury,"
3634,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Had she killed me, would say 'twas manslaughter."
3635,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As it was, from the fear she some rash act might do,"
3636,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To my heels out of sight like an arrow I flew,"
3637,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Truly grieved I was thus forced to thwart her.
3638,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Still returning, I lingered some moments about,"
3639,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To catch hold of some maid, if perchance one came out,"
3640,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Who would fetch me my clothes, for I wished to appear"
3641,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To the greatest advantage, when coming up here;"
3642,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But just as I had made up my mind to depart,"
3643,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"She stepp'd forth, and I scarcely had time back to start,"
3644,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Ere she drew near the spot where I stood;
3645,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And, overwhelmed by despair, on the bank's mossy side"
3646,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"She flung herself down, and most piteously cried."
3647,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"'Oh, poor dear! 'twill,' I thought, 'do her good.'"
3648,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"She had buried her face in her hands from my view,"
3649,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Yet I saw a tear trickle her long fingers through,--"
3650,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,How I wished I her grief could assuage!
3651,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But I feared all the means I the pow'r had to try,"
3652,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Which her sorrows could soothe, or her bitter tears dry,"
3653,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Might p'rhaps also rekindle her rage:
3654,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So I kept snug concealed there as still as a mouse,"
3655,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Till she sobbed out the very last tear;
3656,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then just waited to see her safe into the house,"
3657,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And made double-quick haste to get here.
3658,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So, my friends, you perceive that no blame I can own,"
3659,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,I felt sure the excuse for the fault would atone;
3660,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"With your leave I will go now and fetch Mr. Peter,"
3661,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Cruel Fate has perplexed me, but still I'll defeat her."""
3662,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3663,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Stop,"" said Flanagan John, ""little Patrick will go,--"
3664,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Every turn in the wood he from instinct must know;
3665,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And besides, I've been waiting I don't know how long,"
3666,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For the treat you just promised--a comical song."""
3667,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3668,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Well,"" said Murphy, ""I fear I'm not equal at present,"
3669,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And a molar he eased with the quill of a pheasant;
3670,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Not quite wound up, I mean, for a comical strain,"
3671,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Though not long in key doleful I mean to remain.
3672,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But if Pat, my young namesake, my son that's to be,"
3673,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Will just trouble himself after Peter to see,"
3674,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And Maguire will oblige with the part instrumental,"
3675,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I will try what I can in a song sentimental."""
3676,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""With the greatest of pleasure,"" said Patrick, ""I'm sure,"""
3677,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As he bolted without hat or cap through the door;
3678,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though he tarried outside till the singing was done,"
3679,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And then swift as the deer on his errand he run.
3680,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But quick, look, he returns,--he is after some spree;"
3681,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I can tell by his eyes, they are sparkling with glee:"
3682,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"See, he enters the house by a window behind,--"
3683,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"He will play them some trick, we shall presently find."
3684,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Per-ling, pling--twang, twang, twang, went the fiddle strings soon,"
3685,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As Maguire screwed them up to the requisite tune;
3686,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though he scarce knows the song, he with grief must declare;"
3687,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,So that Murphy politely first whistles the air;
3688,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And then, after a prelude of Maguire's composing,"
3689,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To the following words his melodious voice flows in:
3690,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3691,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""As rambling forth one morning,"
3692,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Whilst the birds were sweetly singing,"
3693,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I chanced to meet fair Kitty,"
3694,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Who her milk-pails home was bringing;
3695,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"She pretended not to see me,"
3696,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And was hastening away,"
3697,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"When I hurried quickly after her,"
3698,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And said, ""Sweet maiden, stay--"
3699,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For I love you fondly, dearly,"
3700,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Most tenderly, sincerely!"
3701,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And than a king more happy you can make me if you choose!"""
3702,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But the maid seemed scarce to hear me;
3703,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Oh! she loves me not, I feared me;"
3704,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For she only shook her little head and said it was no use.
3705,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Oh thou fairest, brightest, flower,"
3706,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That e'er bloomed in beauty's bower!
3707,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Than the nightingale's sweet melody I much prefer your voice;
3708,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then, dear maid, be not thus cruel,"
3709,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I can bear neglect from you, ill."
3710,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As I've banished all your rivals to allow you the first choice."""
3711,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Oh, you men do so deceive, sir,"
3712,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"That your vows I'll not believe, sir,"
3713,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For you tell each girl she's pretty, that you roaming chance to meet;"
3714,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then, besides, some other fellow"
3715,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"P'rhaps may love me quite as well oh,"
3716,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Who has vowed to be my slave through life, and thrown him at my feet."""
3717,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""I will challenge ev'ry other,"
3718,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Who presumes to be your lover,"
3719,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though I kill a man each morning, not a minikin care I;"
3720,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Sure, I'll perforate the river,"
3721,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though the thought it makes me shiver,"
3722,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For without you as I cannot live, 'tis pleasant so to die."
3723,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For my heart I know you'll break it,"
3724,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though my love you ne'er can shake it,"
3725,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,'Tis more deeply rooted than yon oak that rears its head on high;
3726,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though the stem of hope is shivered,"
3727,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And each branch of pleasure withered,"
3728,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Yet it clings unto the earth still firm,--so, to my love, will I."""
3729,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Will you promise ne'er to tease me,"
3730,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And do all you can to please me,"
3731,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"If I take you for the better, though I know 'twill be for worse?"
3732,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Are you sure you love me truly?
3733,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Well, I cannot think that you lie,"
3734,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But remember 'tis yourself I wed, and not your gilded purse."""
3735,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3736,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Bravo! bravo! capital song,"
3737,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Very good length, and nothing too long;"
3738,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Lots of fine feeling and plenty of sense,"
3739,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Comical rather, and of int'rest immense."""
3740,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3741,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,It was Flanagan John
3742,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Sang this snatch of a song,"
3743,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Though the tune he was far from correct in;
3744,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But he's one that don't care,"
3745,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And will do and can dare
3746,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"What he likes, without ever reflecting."
3747,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Let's encore it!--Encore!"""
3748,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""No,"" said Murphy, ""no more,"
3749,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,I must really the pleasure decline;
3750,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"'Tis now some lady's turn,"
3751,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"They such pretty songs learn,"
3752,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,When their voices to singing incline.
3753,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Ask the fairy-like May,"
3754,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Who with Samuel Delhay
3755,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,In a corner like two birds are caged.
3756,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Here, my sweet pretty Miss,"
3757,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"May I ask for a kiss,"
3758,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"When those sweet lips are quite disengaged?"""
3759,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Oh, for shame!"""
3760,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Said the dame,"
3761,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Dearest Murphy, you really should never"
3762,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Say such things,"
3763,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For it brings
3764,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,A deep tint to the fairest cheek ever.
3765,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But I'm sure Miss Maguire will oblige with a song,"
3766,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I have heard her fine voice, though some time ago, long;"
3767,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"When a child she was, under my care."""
3768,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Well,"" said Jerry Maguire,"
3769,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""She has at my desire"
3770,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Set her voice to an enchanting air;
3771,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Which with pleasure she'll sing,"
3772,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"'Tis exactly the thing,"
3773,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Will amuse our old friend sitting there."""
3774,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Oh, do sing, dearest May,"""
3775,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Whispered Samuel Delhay;
3776,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Pray oblige us,"" said every guest;"
3777,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Now then, May, don't be shy,"""
3778,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Said her brother, ""when I"
3779,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Can assist if you aid should request."""
3780,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""And,"" said Murphy, ""I, too,"
3781,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Will be sure to clap you,"
3782,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"If you will but oblige with your best."""
3783,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""I will try my best style,"""
3784,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,She replied with a smile;
3785,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""If you'll promise you'll not be offended."
3786,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Nor will go so far wrong,"
3787,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As to think that my song
3788,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As a close to your tale is intended."""
3789,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Dear, what can the girl mean?"
3790,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"'Twill be presently seen,"""
3791,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Muttered he as the promise he gave.
3792,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then her voice mounted high,"
3793,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As a lark in the sky,"
3794,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As she warbled each beautiful stave.
3795,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Ev'ry ear it arrests, ev'ry whisper soon dropt,"
3796,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Even breathing that moment appeared to be stopt.
3797,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"While each bosom seem'd touched by the soft, thrilling strain,"
3798,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And few eyes quite unwashed to the end could remain.
3799,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,The good dame as she hears
3800,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Gently melts into tears
3801,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As she thinks of disconsolate Joan.
3802,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Who, heart-broken and sad,"
3803,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Or from grief nearly mad,"
3804,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Is bewailing her hard fate alone.
3805,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"The words simply are these,"
3806,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Which fair May sang to tease
3807,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Mr. Murphy, though it she'll not own."
3808,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3809,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Oh, my beautiful flow'ret has faded,"
3810,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Is drooping its once joyous head;
3811,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For the bee with its sweetness has laded
3812,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,His wings and away with it fled.
3813,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3814,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And the fierce, cruel wind, it hath broken"
3815,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,The stem which the bright blossom fed;
3816,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,While the leaves by their sad looks have spoken
3817,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Their grief for the kind parent dead.
3818,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3819,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So my heart's fondest hope has been slighted,"
3820,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Ev'ry joy has been stolen from me.
3821,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I am drooping, am with'ring, am blighted;"
3822,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But the wreck of life shattered you see.
3823,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3824,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Never more shall the sun by its brightness
3825,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Illumine my dark gloomy fate;
3826,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Nor can peace to my spirit bring lightness,"
3827,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For he comes to this bosom too late."""
3828,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3829,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Now to scatter the gloom
3830,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Which pervaded the room,"
3831,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Murphy piles all the chairs into heaps.
3832,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Flings his arm round the dame
3833,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"(Declares he's not to blame),"
3834,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And with her to the room's centre creeps.
3835,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,While Maguire struck up soon
3836,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Such a capital tune,"
3837,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That like magic each youth forward leaps
3838,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To the side of some fair,"
3839,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Who, with pleasure, steps where"
3840,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,She in dancing can best show her feats.
3841,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"In and out,"
3842,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Round about,"
3843,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,It appears quite a riddle.
3844,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Hands across,"
3845,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Turn of course,"
3846,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And then rush down the middle.
3847,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Back again,"
3848,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Pleasant pain!
3849,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Sure he'll wear out his fiddle.
3850,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Quicker play!"""
3851,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Scrape away!"""
3852,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Cries each pair as they pass by;
3853,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As whirling
3854,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And twirling
3855,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,They still swifter and fast fly;
3856,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And in spite,"
3857,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though fagged quite,"
3858,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Who can keep up the last try.
3859,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Till whizzy
3860,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And dizzy
3861,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,They sink into a seat;
3862,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,If they aint
3863,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Fit to faint
3864,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,In a terrible heat.
3865,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"When to cool,"
3866,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As by rule,"
3867,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To some draught they retreat.
3868,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Where the fair one imbibes such a delicate chill
3869,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That her frame is refreshed; but ere morning she will
3870,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Find the thoroughfare stopped in her organ of smell;
3871,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,With a rising blockade in the thorax as well.
3872,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"While her forehead of snow into pieces seems splitting,"
3873,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As the pain ev'ry moment is worse and worse getting.
3874,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And her bright eyes are streaming regret for the folly
3875,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Which has garnished her lungs with a feeling like holly;
3876,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And has changed her sweet voice, as a matter of course,"
3877,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,From the nightingale's tone to sound dreadfully hoarse.
3878,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3879,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Oh, how funny it seems to one not fond of dancing,"
3880,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To see women and men just like animals prancing!
3881,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Roaming forwards and back like two bears in a cage,"
3882,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And then galloping round as if put in a rage.
3883,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Working harder--I'll bet ten young pigs to a sow,"
3884,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Than they've been all day long at the tail of the plough."""
3885,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Stop!"" I fancy I hear some fair maiden exclaim,"
3886,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,In a tone full of ire strongly mixed with disdain.
3887,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""'Tis some horrid old man has been writing this tale,"
3888,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Who will make his remarks, though so stupid and stale."""
3889,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now, kind reader, of this I must beg to assure you,"
3890,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That 'twas Flanagan muttered those words placed before you.
3891,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3892,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Rat-a-tat! ""Who is that?"" Murphy cried; ""pray come in."""
3893,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And a priest walked inside who had listening been.
3894,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,How the widow's heart beat as he stept up to greet her!
3895,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"He was very much like, still he was not old Peter."
3896,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Sure I'm in for it now,"" Murphy inwardly thought;"
3897,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""I would fly, but must own I've been quite fairly caught."
3898,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"No I aint!--'tis but Pat, though in clever disguise;"
3899,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"He may cheat his old Mother's, but not these young eyes."
3900,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But I'll not spoil the fun; I'm reprieved by his aid.
3901,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Ah! his voice, as I feared, has the secret betrayed;"
3902,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And the good little dame appears quite in a pet.
3903,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,P'rhaps she'll wait longer still for a young bridegroom yet!
3904,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For I rather repent having scouted poor Joan,"
3905,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"She is prettier far, though I don't like her home."
3906,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Still a second-hand wife, and four babes ready made,"
3907,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Must be popped in the scale and against that be weighed.
3908,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Now, Murphy,"" cried Flanagan, ""your comical song!"
3909,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Why, you look black as if all on earth had gone wrong!"
3910,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Come, I'll bet what you like I can guess what you thought"
3911,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"(If you did take the trouble to meditate aught),"
3912,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"'Tis a bother, I own, and you well may look blue"
3913,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,(Still you're quite green enough if your friends all speak true).
3914,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Oh, I fear you are out both of temper and tune,"
3915,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But I'll give you a song which shall banish care soon."""
3916,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then he whetted his whistle, and clearing his voice,"
3917,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,In a very gruff tone sang this ditty so choice:--
3918,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3919,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Oh, those that like, let them be sad,"
3920,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For my part I'll be merry.
3921,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"A life like theirs would drive me mad,"
3922,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So I'll be jolly, very."
3923,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3924,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"If Cupid should catch hold of me,"
3925,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And from my love me sever,"
3926,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And into woe would turn my glee,"
3927,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Shall he succeed?--no, never!"
3928,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3929,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"If valued friends prove false, unkind,"
3930,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,When any scrape I get in;
3931,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I'll drive their memory from my mind,"
3932,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And thus no sorrow let in.
3933,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3934,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"If Miss Fortune should use me ill,"
3935,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And steal my only penny,"
3936,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Contentedly I'll jog on still,"
3937,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As happy without any.
3938,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3939,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though Landladies may bore for rent,"
3940,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And duns may loudly bellow;
3941,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I'll tell them, though my money's spent,"
3942,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,I'm still a jolly fellow.
3943,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3944,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For love in sparkling wine I'll drown
3945,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,All care and melancholy;
3946,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,They are but fools who sigh and frown;
3947,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For my part I'll be jolly."""
3948,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3949,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,[Illustration: Then again the wild dance]
3950,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
3951,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Then again the wild dance
3952,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Does each young toe entrance,"
3953,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And p'rhaps many an old one beside.
3954,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,There's antique Miss O'Riley
3955,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Has coaxed Donoghue slily
3956,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Just to waltz, which he ne'er before tried."
3957,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For she chatted so pretty,"
3958,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And talked, oh, so witty,"
3959,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That he guessed at her age rather wide.
3960,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But the maiden soon found
3961,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"She must drag him right round,"
3962,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For he could not his steps at all guide.
3963,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"While his arms stuck out still,"
3964,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Like the sails of a mill--
3965,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,How young Flanagan laughed till he cried!
3966,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And called out, ""Take care, Tom, what sweet words you are saying;"
3967,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For the breach of a promise you'll not like the paying."""
3968,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""What are breaches of promise?"" said Donoghue laughing,"
3969,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Who was not so well versed as his friend was in chaffing.
3970,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Oh,"" said Flanagan Ted, who was comical rather,"
3971,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""They are breeches you'll get when worn out by your father."""
3972,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Oh, look, Mother!"" cried Pat; ""all the wood seems on fire;"
3973,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"It was first but a spark, but it now rises higher."
3974,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"We shall surely get burnt, for 'tis coming this way:"
3975,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"What a flare-up to finish a grand bridal day!"""
3976,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But the dame felt depressed
3977,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"In her feelings, and guessed"
3978,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,He was only a-joking again.
3979,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So that no heed she took,"
3980,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"No, not even a look,"
3981,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Although calling he still would remain.
3982,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Like the boy that we read of in old Æsop's fable,"
3983,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,He has jested till none to believe him are able.
3984,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Come, niece, give us some punch,"
3985,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And of cake a slight hunch,"
3986,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"May it taste as it looks, so uncommonly nice,"
3987,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"That I've wished for some long,"
3988,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But I feared 'twould be wrong,"
3989,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And might p'rhaps be thought greedy to ask for a slice.
3990,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"All the dancers, 'tis clear,"
3991,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Very hungry appear,"
3992,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And would much be refreshed by that snow-looking ice;
3993,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,While some hot whisky will
3994,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Perhaps warm up the chill
3995,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"They imbibed at the draught by not taking advice."""
3996,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"'Twas old Jonas thus spoke,"
3997,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Half in earnest, half joke,"
3998,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,The good dame from her rev'rie to rouse.
3999,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But the lady felt sad,"
4000,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And thought just cause she had
4001,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For the grief which her spirit allows.
4002,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4003,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Still the punch she prepared,"
4004,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Though she sharply declared
4005,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,She had rather not cut up the cake;
4006,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For the event it should grace
4007,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Had not yet taken place,"
4008,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And much trouble it took her to make.
4009,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4010,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Hark! what voices are those?"""
4011,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Murphy cried, as he rose"
4012,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And went to look out at the door.
4013,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But soon entered again,"
4014,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And admitted a train
4015,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Of monks, about twenty or more."
4016,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"All in darkness arrayed,"
4017,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"With their heads in a shade,"
4018,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Although each one a flaming torch bore.
4019,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,At the head of the band
4020,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Marched the Abbot so grand,"
4021,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Whom the beaux lowly bend soon before.
4022,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For him ev'ry one knows
4023,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As his very best clothes,"
4024,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And his mitre so gorgeous he wore.
4025,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Which seemed covered with gold,"
4026,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Then made sticky and rolled
4027,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Among jewels to spangle it o'er;
4028,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And which glittered so bright
4029,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As they shot back the light,"
4030,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That most folks the real gems took them for.
4031,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4032,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now young Patrick had noticed this monkish array,"
4033,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As amid the dark forest it wended its way;
4034,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But as no one would answer the first time he spoke,"
4035,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,He considered that p'rhaps it might be a good joke
4036,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,If the crew on the party came unawares in
4037,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As they're dancing, or drinking: things deemed a great sin"
4038,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"By the Abbot, he knows--who had vexed been right sore"
4039,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,When he stumbled on much the same party before.
4040,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And truly it did cause a little confusion,"
4041,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For the liquors just mixed in the greatest profusion
4042,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Filled the air with a grateful perfume.
4043,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But as for the present they're too hot for drinking,"
4044,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"The ladies were sniffing the odour, and thinking,"
4045,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,When he first had stept into the room;
4046,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though some rather too bold were near choked, by the bye,"
4047,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And got burnt in their fright, till a tear leaves each eye,"
4048,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Which their temper does rather consume.
4049,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4050,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But how sudden the spirits have vanished from sight!
4051,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Far more rapid, I'm certain, than conjuring quite."
4052,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For the Abbot, in spite of the scent, is believing"
4053,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"That his nose plays him false, and has been him deceiving."
4054,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Not the shade of a cork can he anywhere see,"
4055,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Though the kettle is boiling--it may be for tea.
4056,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4057,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But I often have seen the same trick played before
4058,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"When I was but a young one, about half a score,"
4059,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As my ma has been mending some portion of dress,"
4060,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,(What the garment might be I will leave you to guess).
4061,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"If a loud double-knock has been heard at the door,"
4062,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Quick as thought the said garment has rolled to the floor;
4063,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And been under the sofa kicked out of the way,"
4064,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Till the visit has ended the guest came to pay.
4065,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4066,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now no one had spoken,"
4067,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Till silence was broken
4068,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"By the Abbot, who said,--"
4069,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Friends, I'm come to unite"
4070,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,By the conjugal rite
4071,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,The young pair who would wed.
4072,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But, pray, which is the bridegroom, and which is the bride?--"
4073,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Are you firmly resolved, then, to have your fates tied"
4074,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"In a very tight knot, which you neither can sever,"
4075,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though you're sick of each other, as folks must get ever?"
4076,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As the poet so justly has said, (who so wise?)"
4077,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,'In the best-ordered families rows will arise.'
4078,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So I'll wait a few moments, just out of humanity,"
4079,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Till you've thought o'er again what may prove quite insanity.
4080,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now, young bridegroom, just think--are you feeling quite sure"
4081,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That for life you the ways of this dame can endure;
4082,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And with joy hear her chatter from morning till night
4083,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"(About nothing at all, mind,)--with unfeigned delight?"
4084,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For Plato remarks, 'That he ne'er in his life"
4085,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Heard an orator speak half so much as his wife.
4086,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"She would prate when she woke, and still chattering keep"
4087,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Until night, and would even then talk in her sleep.'"
4088,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now, could you bear this to the end of your days,"
4089,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Supposing that always she spoke to your praise?
4090,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Which by no means the case is, as sages declare,"
4091,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,(For of course in such matters we priests have no share).
4092,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now I somewhere have read, but where, by mishap,"
4093,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Can't remember at present--the fair are a trap
4094,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Made to catch the poor men, just like so many birds,"
4095,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"With a few pretty looks and a lot of sweet words,"
4096,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Which persuade them to think they would not mind it much,"
4097,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And they yield as a prey to the feminine clutch.
4098,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"When, lo!--but I'll not track this sad history farther;"
4099,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Than e'er marry myself I would really die rather."""
4100,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Sour grapes! sour grapes!"" whispered Jonas, ""'tis plain."
4101,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But how lucky that single he still can remain!
4102,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Sure I married have been thirty years, and ne'er found"
4103,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"The discomforts with which the said state does abound."""
4104,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Very likely,"" was Flanagan's smothered reply;"
4105,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""But _I've_ found all he said more than true by the bye;"
4106,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So it is, after all, but a matter of taste,"
4107,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And it really seems foolish so much time to waste.
4108,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But that Murphy is mad there is less than no doubt,"
4109,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Or he would the young wife, not the old one seek out."
4110,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For I've seen the fair damsel of whom he was speaking,"
4111,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As pretty a girl as you'd find, though far seeking;"
4112,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"With such beautiful eyes, such a sweet little nose;"
4113,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And such neat little ankles, and delicate toes:"
4114,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"That, though t'other's your niece, sir, you fain must agree"
4115,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"He must have some good reasons, or lunatic be."
4116,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Sure I felt much surprised when I heard he was going
4117,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To marry dame Neale, for I thought he was sowing"
4118,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,All the seeds of affection in little Joan's heart.
4119,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But most likely they've quarrelled, and settled to part."""
4120,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Hush,"" said Jonas; ""the Abbot is speaking again;"
4121,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That a screw has got loose appears perfectly plain.
4122,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,How I wish I could speak with the dame all alone!
4123,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I should learn rather more, then, concerning poor Joan."
4124,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But he seems in a hurry to marry them, now,--"
4125,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I've a good mind to stop him, but don't like a row."""
4126,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Then you really intend"
4127,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Both your fortunes to blend
4128,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Into one;
4129,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And promise you'll never
4130,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,From each other sever
4131,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Till life 's done?
4132,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"When as, sir, from your youth you will most like survive,"
4133,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To provide for these babes will you promise to strive?
4134,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For, deprived of their ma, if I right understand,"
4135,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Most young ladies are likely to stick long on hand.
4136,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Unless (and I here must the failings unfold
4137,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Of the world), all their pockets are stuffed full of gold;"
4138,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,When all other attractions--O thought most distressing!
4139,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Are considered no more than the regular blessing
4140,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Which the milkman bestows after measuring out
4141,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,The pale chalk-coloured fluid he carries about.
4142,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Yes! sweet temper and truth are of little avail
4143,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,When proud Wealth takes his seat in the opposite scale.
4144,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As the proverb declares, which we all so well know,"
4145,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That 'tis money alone that the mare makes to go.
4146,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But of course, sir, 'twas nothing at all of this kind"
4147,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Which has thus to stern fate made you meekly resigned!
4148,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"It was love--purely love, caused your heart to prefer,"
4149,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"From all others to flee, and reside here with her."
4150,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But what's this I hear?
4151,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Who dares interfere,"
4152,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,With such racket and unseemly noise?
4153,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Mr. Bridegroom go, see,"
4154,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"(We will tarry for thee),"
4155,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Please to flog 'em if 'tis your two boys."""
4156,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then not one of them spoke,"
4157,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Though all thought 'twas some joke
4158,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Of that monkey, young Patrick O'Neale,"
4159,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Till the urchin they saw
4160,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Fast asleep on the floor,"
4161,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Where he fled in the hopes to conceal
4162,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"The disguise he still wore,"
4163,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For he felt more and more
4164,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That the wrath of the Abbot he'd feel.
4165,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4166,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Let me go! let me go!"" cried a voice from without;"
4167,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And up many arose from their seats to rush out,"
4168,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"When a female dashed through, cast her eyes swift around,"
4169,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"ntAnd exhausted fell down, overwhelmed, to the ground,"
4170,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"At the feet of the dame, who was too much affected"
4171,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To afford the assistance the fair one expected.
4172,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4173,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,[Illustration: And exhausted fell down.]
4174,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4175,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""It is Joan! it is Joan!"" ran in whispers about,"
4176,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And in truth on that subject there seemed little doubt;
4177,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For poor Murphy kept popping his head in and out,"
4178,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Till the Abbot requested he'd walk in instead,"
4179,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"When he took to his heels and ran off with his head,"
4180,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And as fast out of sight as a pickpocket fled.
4181,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Fetch him back!"" cried the Abbot, in thundering tone,"
4182,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And far swifter than light'ning the monks out have flown;
4183,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Oh, such speed you'd have thought that they never could own!"
4184,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"It is true that old Peter kept quite in the rear,"
4185,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Still he bustled along though without an idea
4186,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Of beholding the sport till his friends brought it near.
4187,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Yet 'tis true (though you choose to believe it or not),"
4188,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,He was one of the first to return to the spot
4189,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,When the captors their pris'ner in safe keeping had got.
4190,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4191,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Now all through this commotion the beautiful maid
4192,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Veiled her face in her hands, as if really afraid"
4193,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To encounter the gaze of the numbers of eyes
4194,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Which she felt stared upon her with unfeigned surprise.
4195,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So reclining she sat on the brick-covered floor,"
4196,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And so mournfully sobbed, 'twould have made your heart sore"
4197,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To behold one so tender, so young, and so fair"
4198,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Almost broken in heart, and nigh crushed by despair;"
4199,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Nearly out of her mind, and without an idea"
4200,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Of what she should do, now she's found them out here."
4201,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then again silence reigned,"
4202,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And each tongue still remained,"
4203,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Till the monks back returned
4204,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"With their captive, held tight,"
4205,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Who seemed breathless with fright,"
4206,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"While his face fiercely burned,"
4207,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Like a red-hot coal blowed,"
4208,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Which to all plainly showed
4209,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,He had punishment earned.
4210,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For the Abbot was one who but rarely had missed
4211,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,The least chance that he had of his toe getting kissed.
4212,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Not exactly saluting his bunions, I mean,"
4213,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But of causing his sway to be visibly seen.
4214,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"By all other folks humbling he thought he should rise,"
4215,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,So had made it a point all the world to despise;
4216,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Ev'ry small fault exposing which hidden might pass,"
4217,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Was tracked out like a snake by the trail in the grass.
4218,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Sir, I'm sorry,"" he said, in a sarcastic tone,"
4219,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""If from other appointments I keep you: unknown"
4220,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To my sight till this hour you perhaps may have been,"
4221,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Still your character now I have readily seen;
4222,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And would say a few words ere we part for the night,"
4223,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,On a subject perhaps you can give us some light.
4224,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Be so kind as to give that young lady a seat."""
4225,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But before he could move Joan had rose to her feet,"
4226,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And exclaimed, ""Oh, base man! you might well flee with shame!"
4227,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,'Twas to warn these good people I hitherward came.
4228,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Oh, how could you thus serve me, who lov'd you so dearly!"
4229,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Whom you promised to wed once or twice--very nearly.
4230,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Is it thus all our kindness and trust you repay?
4231,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Such ingratitude never I met till to-day.
4232,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Still I'll wish you no worse, but your heart may relent,"
4233,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And for all the grief caused me may quickly repent."""
4234,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then again into tears she was melting away,"
4235,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Having said all she had for the present to say.
4236,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,While her beautiful hair (dark and soft as black silk)
4237,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Trickled down her fair neck (whiter far than new milk)
4238,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"In the greatest disorder, without comb or pin;"
4239,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For to be in good time, such a haste she was in;"
4240,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And unto the dame to support her she clung--
4241,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"With her head on her shoulder, her face downward hung;"
4242,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For the crimson tide rising rushed through ev'ry vein,"
4243,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,With a pang piercing sharper than actual pain.
4244,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4245,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Come, Sir, Mr. Bridegroom, or whatever 's your name,"
4246,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Let me hear some excuse which shall ward off the blame
4247,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Which you richly deserve, if appearance tells true."
4248,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But they say--and their saying shall benefit you--
4249,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"That folks ought not to go by appearances ever,"
4250,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But should judge from plain facts, as more law-like and clever."
4251,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So I'll hear all you have, sir, to say in defence"
4252,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Of what seems to these ladies a serious offence."""
4253,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4254,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now, between you and I, the good Abbot enjoys"
4255,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,This dispute quite as much as a child does his toys;
4256,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And his eyes wander oft to the beautiful maid,"
4257,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To whose cause he inclines, I am sadly afraid."
4258,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And so too you would feel if your heart be not stone,"
4259,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though, like him, p'rhaps the feeling you'd not care to own."
4260,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Still I'm sure your compassion would so far arise,"
4261,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That you'd lend her your kerchief to wipe up her eyes;
4262,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And would feel much inclined, and with justice, I'm fearing,"
4263,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To condemn the poor culprit before his case hearing.
4264,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4265,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But he speaks! and relates all he stated before,"
4266,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And declares he ne'er promised to marry her, nor"
4267,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Had said anything pointed, to give her to think"
4268,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That his fate unto hers he was wishing to link.
4269,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Stop--I did call her pretty, one time, by the bye,"
4270,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But she took not the trouble my words to deny;
4271,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So 'tis plain she thought them not so out of the way,"
4272,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But a kind of a tribute that folks ought to pay.
4273,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then I lived in the house, and so might once have kissed her,"
4274,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For I treated her just as if she'd been my sister;
4275,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Going out with her walks when she wanted fresh air,"
4276,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And by treating her always at every fair."""
4277,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4278,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now I've heard a remark, which I know to be true,"
4279,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That a man is no judge of the kind of a view
4280,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Which a sister presents to unprejudiced eyes.
4281,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For I've seen brothers stare with a look of surprise
4282,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"When I talked of a sister, and thought I would flatter"
4283,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"If I made a remark, or but cast a glance at her."
4284,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I, by chance, once myself made this very mistake"
4285,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"(Near as awkward a one as a man can well make),"
4286,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For I have a few sisters, but never once thought"
4287,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Them much out of the way, till more properly taught."
4288,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"They explained I was wrong, and I could not well doubt it,"
4289,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For they proved that I really knew nothing about it.
4290,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4291,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now in just this position was poor Murphy placed,"
4292,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,He could scarcely perceive Joan was prettily faced;
4293,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"She was handy, he knew, in the kitchen and dairy,"
4294,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But for beauty--he thought that tastes widely must vary.
4295,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"It was living together so long, I suppose,"
4296,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Made him blind to the charms of this beautiful rose.
4297,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For he's not what folks call a man really hard-hearted,"
4298,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And his conscience now pricked him, and terribly smarted,"
4299,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As he thought on the kindness she ever had shown him
4300,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Since the days of his boyhood, when first she had known him."
4301,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4302,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then the dame was asked next,"
4303,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,If she aught had to say;
4304,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"She look'd sad, much perplexed,"
4305,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And her head turned away
4306,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As she said, ""On my word,"
4307,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Till to-day I ne'er saw,"
4308,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"No, nor even have heard"
4309,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Of this maiden before.
4310,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Still it seems very plain
4311,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,She was first in the field;
4312,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So her rights she shall gain,"
4313,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For all claims I now yield.
4314,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"She has loved him, it seems, all her life pretty nigh,"
4315,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So I'm sure she deserves him far better than I,"
4316,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Who all hope--yea, the wish--now for ever resign"
4317,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Of beholding young Murphy a bridegroom of mine.
4318,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Unless (and she here had a slight tickling cough),"
4319,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Your rev'rence think right I should keep to my troth."""
4320,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4321,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Please to stop,"" said the priest; ""this is pretty, no doubt;"
4322,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Still when Justice begins she must have her say out.
4323,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"We have well scanned the subject on every side,"
4324,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But have not yet decreed which by law is the bride;
4325,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though, as some great philosopher wisely observed,"
4326,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,'They who come up the first ought to be the first served.'
4327,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"While the difference of ages compels me to fear,"
4328,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That a storm will arise ere the close of the year;
4329,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For of course the old lady must have her own way,"
4330,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As 'age before honesty goes,' the folks say."
4331,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,It is true she may not get the like chance again;
4332,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But she's had her turn once, so must patient remain."
4333,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Unless that the jury, when packed, shall think best"
4334,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To remake her a wife, and deny her request."""
4335,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4336,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then the jurors were chose,"
4337,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But so plainly he shows
4338,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"How the guests cannot impartial be,"
4339,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"That such aid they refuse,"
4340,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And the number out choose
4341,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,From eyes that unprejudiced see.
4342,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Who like peers soon pair out,"
4343,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To consider about
4344,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,In whose favour they ought to agree.
4345,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Now what thrilling suspense!
4346,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,(To poor Joan how intense!)
4347,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To the rest in a lesser degree.--
4348,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"All but Murphy, who ne'er"
4349,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Seemed to have the least care
4350,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,What Fate or what Justice decree.
4351,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But the Jury return, and the maid droops her head,"
4352,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,While her fair bosom heaves with a feeling of dread;
4353,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As nigh breathless she listens the verdict to hear,"
4354,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Which shall fill her with transports of pleasure or fear.
4355,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""And pray what's your decision?"" the Abbot inquired;"
4356,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"In the tones of a pig who has, murdered, expired."
4357,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Have you settled the point who the fair bride's to be?"
4358,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"They seem terribly anxious to hear your decree."""
4359,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then a very tall man with a very sharp nose,"
4360,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"All their wisdom united and cleverness shows,"
4361,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""'Tis the young one, we think, is by justice the bride,"
4362,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So we deem it our duty on her to decide."""
4363,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Then again a loud shout
4364,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Ran the chamber throughout,"
4365,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,While the maiden had fainted with bliss
4366,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Had not Murphy arose,"
4367,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Who both arms round her throws,"
4368,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And revives her at once with a kiss;
4369,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And whispers that once he but loved as a brother,"
4370,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But now is most anxious to love as some other.
4371,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4372,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But the Abbot, of course, must again interfere."
4373,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Loud he calls, ""Mr. Culprit, just step, sir, up here;"
4374,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And you, monks, keep your eyes on the door."
4375,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For our sentence is this,--that the maiden you wed;"
4376,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Yes, and live with her too till you're dead, sir--quite dead."
4377,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Oh, you ne'er shall escape from her more!"
4378,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And Miss Bride, you'll oblige by just letting me know"
4379,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"If he does not behave himself properly, so"
4380,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,I may think of some punishment sore.
4381,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now, before I unite"
4382,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,In the conjugal rite
4383,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"This unhappy young pair,"
4384,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Is there any one here
4385,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Has the slightest idea
4386,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Of a like rash affair?
4387,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"If there is, I advise,"
4388,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Ere the chance from him flies,"
4389,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That he hither repair.
4390,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For, as Romulus said, you should never delay"
4391,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Till to-morrow what can be as well done to-day.
4392,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For delays dang'rous are, as the widow can prove,"
4393,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And time never returns, but is still on the move."""
4394,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then he silent remained, as if buried in thought,"
4395,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,While his eyelids dropt down as if slumber they sought;
4396,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Till the beautiful Clare, by young Flanagan Ted"
4397,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"(Her long-betrothed lover), was joyfully led."
4398,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"When ""Ah!"" he exclaimed; and again closed his eyes,"
4399,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Just to ponder, no doubt, on some subject more wise;--"
4400,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"On the frailty, perhaps, of the masculine sex,"
4401,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Who allow pretty faces their thoughts to perplex,"
4402,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And their hearts twirl about like a conjurer's plate,"
4403,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,While they kindly persuade them they can't avoid Fate.
4404,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""O dear May! dearest May!"""
4405,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Whispered Samuel Delhay;
4406,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""I scarce know what I say,"
4407,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But just listen, I pray."
4408,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I've loved you so dearly,"
4409,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"A twelvemonth or nearly,"
4410,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Most truly, sincerely,--"
4411,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Not for your looks merely,"
4412,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But the bewitching grace
4413,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,In each action I trace;
4414,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,With which no charm keeps pace
4415,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But your beautiful face.
4416,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Oh, if you would hear me!"
4417,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To be ever near me!
4418,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,What joy would then cheer me!
4419,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though trembling I fear me,"
4420,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Lest you now should say Nay;
4421,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Your dear face turn away,"
4422,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Or should wish for delay,"
4423,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Which were death to obey."""
4424,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then May blushed crimson deep,"
4425,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"While her eyes downward keep,"
4426,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As she seems most intensely to think.
4427,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Till her gaze slily peeps;
4428,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Tow'rds her mother it creeps,"
4429,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Who she saw nearly audibly wink.
4430,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then, no more time to waste,"
4431,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"In his hands hers she placed,"
4432,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Who appeared with such rapture possess'd
4433,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"That he screamed with delight,"
4434,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Put poor May in a fright,"
4435,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And exceedingly startled each guest.
4436,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4437,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Is there no one else then to be married, I pray?"
4438,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Mr. Hymen is not found at work every day,"""
4439,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Said the Abbot; ""can no other man boast a heart?"
4440,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Have you all really 'scaped from young What's-his-name's dart?"""
4441,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Just as if he was only essaying to fill
4442,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Up the number required to form a quadrille;
4443,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And had cried, Take your partners, and no more time waste,"
4444,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,You young people might surely make rather more haste.
4445,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4446,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Oh, pray catch me! Oh, dear!"
4447,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,I'm so dreadfully queer--
4448,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,I shall faint--I shall die--
4449,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I must have a good cry""--"
4450,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Said Miss Riley, who could not her feelings command,"
4451,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As she seized and kept hold of young Donoghue's hand.
4452,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Shall you tell them? Oh, no;"
4453,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Though I'm very so-so.
4454,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And my heart beats so fast,"
4455,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,It will sure burst at last.
4456,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"No! 'tis useless cold water to throw on my grief,"
4457,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Far too deep are my sorrows for such a relief.
4458,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Oh, could you but feel"
4459,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,What my tongue must reveal--
4460,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"How much I love you,"
4461,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,My dear Donoghue!
4462,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Your heart surely would melt, though it very hard aint,"
4463,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And you'd try all you could to relieve my complaint."""
4464,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Well,"" thinks he, ""I don't care,"
4465,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Though in truth she's not fair;
4466,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Still there's hundreds far worse, that I'm sure."""
4467,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So he said, ""You're so kind,"
4468,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Miss, I'd fain ease your mind;"
4469,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But why did you not speak up before?
4470,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For you really have taken me quite by surprise,"
4471,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Though great presence of mind at emergence will rise.
4472,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Still, be quick; for should we by some chance be too late,"
4473,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I must leave you to struggle alone with your fate."""
4474,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4475,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But the course of true love it can never run smooth,"
4476,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As this tale will, as others, undoubtedly prove."
4477,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"There is always some guardian, or cruel old Pa,"
4478,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Who won't give his consent; or some tiresome Ma,"
4479,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Who don't think the young man is quite well enough off
4480,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For her beautiful daughter to wed; and so forth.
4481,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Now old Donoghue tries all he can to find out
4482,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"What so busies his son, till he leaps out of doubt,"
4483,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And jumps at the conclusion, which proves to be true,"
4484,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That he means to get married the old maid unto.
4485,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""I won't give my consent!"" he exclaims in a rage;"
4486,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""And you shall not yourselves to each other engage."
4487,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,I'll disinherit you sure if you dare to resist
4488,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"My commands, and shall still in this madness persist."""
4489,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Oh, oh! what's the matter?"
4490,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"What means all this clatter?"""
4491,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Said the Abbot, who seemed much amused;"
4492,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""It is really too bad!"
4493,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Sure the man must be mad:
4494,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Such an offer, what maid could refuse?"
4495,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Sir, you'd better allow me for life to provide"
4496,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For your child, by converting her into a bride."
4497,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As her poor little heart will undoubtedly break,"
4498,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"If you cruelly make her her first love forsake."""
4499,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""But it is not a daughter,"" the other replied;"
4500,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""'Tis the man is my boy, who, if now he decide"
4501,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To be snared by yon penniless girl, for himself"
4502,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Must look out, for no finger he lays on my wealth."""
4503,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Well, that alters the case;"
4504,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But I really must own
4505,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"That, were I in your place,"
4506,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I would leave them alone,"
4507,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For Love's arrows sink deep, and our heart's blood they quaff,"
4508,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,While the little wretch dares at e'en locksmiths to laugh.
4509,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So it really is wiser to give your consent,"
4510,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For you know you can't really the marriage prevent.
4511,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For what's gold, may I ask, when its charms you compare"
4512,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"With bright smiles, with such looks, and with features so fair?"
4513,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And, besides, the young people are quite old enough"
4514,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To decide for themselves; and advice would seem stuff
4515,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And great nonsense, I fear, to their prejudiced ears;"
4516,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For their eyes are so blinded they won't see your fears."""
4517,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Then the old man sat down
4518,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"With a dark gloomy frown,"
4519,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As he muttered he never would give them a ""brown."""
4520,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But the obstinate son
4521,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Could be ruled o'er by none;
4522,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,When he made up his mind he would have a thing done.
4523,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"So he still stood his ground,"
4524,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And the fearful maid found
4525,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That she now had a chance of her fate getting bound;
4526,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Not just stitched, or bound half,"
4527,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But quite whole bound with calf.
4528,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"How she chuckles with joy, as she grins forth a laugh!"
4529,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As she says the few words which proclaim her the wife
4530,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Of as stupid a man as e'er lived out a life!
4531,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4532,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Now the eight are but four, for a pair forms but one;"
4533,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"They have each one been halved, so they all are undone."
4534,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though the ladies of course (now pray don't make a jest of it),"
4535,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"As the bettermost half, have for ever the best of it."
4536,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Having two votes to one in nigh every dispute,"
4537,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And as much more to say if their words you compute.
4538,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4539,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"See, the bridegrooms are kissing their beautiful brides,"
4540,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Who a kiss too receive from the Abbot besides.
4541,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"All but Dame Donoghue, who by chance seems forgot;"
4542,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Or, perhaps, he had thought he had much rather not."
4543,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Then the Abbot and train prepare to go;
4544,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,They fall into ranks in a double row;
4545,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"While the chief, at their head, walks on before,"
4546,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Without ere a word or a syllable more.
4547,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But old Peter just tarries behind to state
4548,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Why the Abbot had come there, and why so late."
4549,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"He had noticed the monk who was rambling out,"
4550,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And, inquiring, had learnt all the facts about."
4551,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"When to Peter's surprise he declared his mind,"
4552,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That to marry the couple he felt inclined.
4553,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""I was very much vexed that he tarried so late,"
4554,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,As I feared that for me you might probably wait.
4555,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For I know very well, without being told twice,"
4556,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That when victuals are tepid they're not very nice.
4557,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"But I now must be gone; he will miss me, I fear;"
4558,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Though 'twould pleasure me much to await awhile here."""
4559,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4560,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then young Patrick O'Neal out of pity, or jest,"
4561,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Took the half of a duck, which with onions was drest,"
4562,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And to old Peter gave it, unseen by the rest;"
4563,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Who declared he of boys was undoubted the best.
4564,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Then he passed through the door and was soon with the throng
4565,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Who by torchlight were marching the forest along.
4566,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And 'twas lucky he did; for the Abbot inquired
4567,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"After him, who to walk by his side he desired."
4568,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,When a lecture he gave which the folly proved quite
4569,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Of rich dainties employing to cure appetite.
4570,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""They're the seed,"" he remarked, ""of nigh ev'ry disease"
4571,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Which frail mortals invent, them to rob of their ease."
4572,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"What is gout, may I ask, but these victuals condensed"
4573,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And forced into the blood to create pain intense?
4574,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then, just look at your teeth; when compared with a brute,"
4575,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,They're surpassed quite as much as a flower does its root.
4576,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"One is even, as smooth, and as white as a nut;"
4577,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"While the other is jagged, and blacker than soot."
4578,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Slow decaying away, from the poisonous food,"
4579,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Which, to pleasure the palate, the victims have chewed."
4580,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Still, in spite the result, as of sense quite bereft,"
4581,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"They persist, like the lunatics lately I've left."
4582,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I can't drive the _foul_ smell from my nose,"" he exclaimed;"
4583,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""The effluvia such hold on my sense has obtained."""
4584,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4585,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Then weeks and weeks rolled slowly by,"
4586,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And nothing strange had met the eye.
4587,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"The birds had ris'n every morn,"
4588,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And frightened been from off the corn.
4589,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"The bees had sipped the flow'ry juice,"
4590,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Preparing it for private use.
4591,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,The sheep had parted with their fleece;
4592,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,They held it on uncertain lease.
4593,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"The fruit had all been plucked, or fell,"
4594,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And made more ill than tongue can tell.
4595,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"The golden grain by reapers' care,"
4596,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Had strewn the rich fields everywhere;
4597,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And filled the barns with Nature's store,"
4598,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,For winter's use when summer's o'er.
4599,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For Autumn's sunny days are past,"
4600,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And gloomy clouds are gathering fast.
4601,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"While northern gales assail the trees,"
4602,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Their treasures scattering to the breeze.
4603,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Poor Peter, through unlucky fate,"
4604,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Has not been fishing out of late.
4605,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"He cannot fly that fearful dream,"
4606,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Which in the dusky night will seem
4607,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,To float before his slumb'ring gaze
4608,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"To fright his heart, and thoughts amaze."
4609,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"The Abbot fills him, too, with fear;"
4610,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"He fancies he is always near,"
4611,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"He cannot from his presence get,"
4612,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But feels like some one dunn'd for debt.
4613,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And trembles when he meets those eyes
4614,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,That love to catch him by surprise.
4615,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4616,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,But dogs can't always watchful keep;
4617,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Most wide-awake men sometimes sleep;
4618,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And Peter gains a short respite
4619,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,From thoughts which needlessly affright.
4620,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"For really he was watched by none,"
4621,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Save what his conscience may have done.
4622,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,
4623,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,O day of bliss! O joyful day!
4624,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"The Abbot hastens far away,"
4625,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And comes not back till morrow's night!
4626,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,Old Peter seems delighted quite.
4627,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""I will dine and will sup too off Jack,"" said he;"
4628,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"""Nicely lined with veal stuffing. What joy! what glee!"
4629,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"Let me see, where's my tackle? In yonder hole;"
4630,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,I must catch a few gudgeon and have a troll.
4631,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"O I know a snug spot where the river runs deep,"
4632,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,And there I will be ere they wake from their sleep.
4633,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"I will see that their breakfast is nicely made,"
4634,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,"And that, also, the reckoning's duly paid."
4635,_CHAPTER THE SEVENTH._,

4638,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._
4639,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,
4640,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,The morn was dull when Peter rose;
4641,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"And stormy, like the north wind blows;"
4642,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,While the dark sky too plainly shows
4643,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Ere long there will be rain.
4644,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"""But still,"" thinks he; ""I'll go in spite;"
4645,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"'Twill sharpen up their appetite,"
4646,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,And make them all the better bite;
4647,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Such chance to lose gives pain.
4648,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"I tarry may a month or more,"
4649,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Till Christmas comes perchance, before"
4650,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,I shall another day secure;
4651,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"If so, I'll go again."
4652,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Then, with what food he could procure,"
4653,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,He hurried through the Abbey door;
4654,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,But oft looked back to make quite sure;
4655,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,His fears were really vain.
4656,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,
4657,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Pray, angling reader, was it ne'er your fate,"
4658,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,When fish were biting to be short of bait?
4659,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Have you ne'er roked about in terra-firma
4660,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"To find a grub, a chrysalis, a worm--or"
4661,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,For e'en a grasshopper searched o'er a field
4662,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Which would not e'en a caterpillar yield,"
4663,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"While droves of perch, impatient to be hooked,"
4664,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Have vainly round for some temptation looked?
4665,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,
4666,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Now, in such a position was poor Peter placed;"
4667,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,He had flown to the river in very great haste.
4668,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Still, although he had sought out a gravelly nook,"
4669,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,But a pair of young gudgeons approached near his hook.
4670,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,In the space of an hour--so a trimmer he set;
4671,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"While he tried, though in vain, a few others to get."
4672,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"""There's a bite! there's a bite! see the reel how it turns!"""
4673,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"He exclaimed, and his face with excitement fierce burns,"
4674,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"""Ah, it now has stopt short! 'tis to pouch it,"" he thought;"
4675,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"""Look! 'tis running again, and the fellow is caught!"""
4676,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"But, alas! when he struck, to his grief and dismay"
4677,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"He discovered, the jack had his bait torn away."
4678,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"""O how foolish,"" he said; ""it was of me to throw"
4679,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,That fine gudgeon away! I might guess 'twould be so.
4680,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"I detest using live bait, you're certain to lose them,"
4681,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"For it seems the fish think they're put to amuse them,"
4682,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"And away he will drag them, or into bits chews them--"
4683,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Just avoiding the hook, which might stick in their teeth."
4684,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Oh, their cunning it really surpasses belief!"
4685,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,One would think they were brought up from birth as a thief.
4686,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"But I'll try trolling now, as they seem on the feed,"
4687,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,They must swallow the hook if the bait they then heed.
4688,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"But vain his hope, though time away"
4689,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Skips fast; the fish admire delay,"
4690,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,And scarce to him attention pay.
4691,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Perchance, his want of skill they saw,"
4692,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,And from destruction quick withdraw
4693,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,To where they may their lives insure.
4694,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,
4695,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"'Tis but midday, yet darkness shrouds the sky,"
4696,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,For clouds of blackness furiously roll by.
4697,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"The watery sun has fled, but not to rest--"
4698,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Behind a cloud which overflows the West--
4699,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"The distant thunder strikes the list'ning ear,"
4700,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,And streams of lightning pour down far and near.
4701,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Yet still dame Nature grasps the slippery rains,"
4702,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Who, struggling, long to scour the dusty plains."
4703,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,
4704,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,But all these signs of tempest are forgot
4705,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"As soon as seen, or p'rhaps are heeded not,"
4706,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"By our friend Peter, for behold his line"
4707,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Gently unrolls and cleaves a watery mine.
4708,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"With patient, anxious, fate-imploring look,"
4709,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,He trembling hopes that now his laden hook
4710,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"May sink low down into the dark abyss,"
4711,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Midst fishes' entrails, where it cannot miss"
4712,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Its deadly hold; and where, till life shall fly,"
4713,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,The barbèd hook immoveable may lie.
4714,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"But, oh! his chicks he counts before they're hatched,"
4715,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"For by his foe, in skill, he's more than matched,"
4716,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"(The scaly monster,) who at length of line,"
4717,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,The close acquaintance sharply does decline.
4718,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"He tugged, it pulled, but all, alas! was vain,"
4719,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,For one on t'other not an inch could gain.
4720,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"First Peter, winding, thought his foe waxed faint,"
4721,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"But quickly Jack untwisting--cried, ""I aint."""
4722,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Thus passed an hour, but still he keeps the water,"
4723,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Though Peter stormed, and vowed he'd give no quarter"
4724,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"When land he reached; but Jack thought all this fun,"
4725,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"And cried ""No quarter! I'll 'scape whole or none."""
4726,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Then the friar, impatient, began to use force,"
4727,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"When his line snapt in two, as a matter of course."
4728,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,
4729,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"[Illustration: The Friar, impatient, began to use force.]"
4730,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,
4731,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Oh! how then enraged, from his head he tore"
4732,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"The little of hair that his cropped pate bore,"
4733,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"As he flung himself down out of breath to the ground,"
4734,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,And furious raved at each object around.
4735,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"While such very bad words at the fish he said,"
4736,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,That I'm sure they should never in print be read.
4737,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"For, pray why should a muse, for amusement who sings,"
4738,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Fill her kind readers' mouth with another's foul things.
4739,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"'Tis a fault I lament, so I'll not have a share in"
4740,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,The habit some have of quotation in swearing.
4741,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,In heavy drops the water now descends;
4742,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,And earth with sky the darkening torrent blends.
4743,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Which soaking through the friar, tries to cool"
4744,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"His anger, and persuade him he's a fool."
4745,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"""But still,"" said he; ""I will not leave in spite,"
4746,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Till one I've caught, although the coming night"
4747,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Shall fling down shadows to obscure my sight;
4748,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Here will I stop until they choose to bite."""
4749,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,
4750,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Then Time rushed past, but unsuccessful still"
4751,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,His firm resolve he tarries to fulfil.
4752,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"While louder yet the tempest wildly roars,"
4753,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,And drives the torrent o'er surrounding shores.
4754,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Whence down, resistless, onward bounding hurls"
4755,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"The bubbling current, and like whirlpool curls."
4756,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"The frightened fish, too nervous, far, to feed,"
4757,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Dive down and hide beneath a battered reed.
4758,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Yet to measure the stream with his line he persists,"
4759,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Though his arms they feel sprained, and ache down to the wrists;"
4760,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"And the darkness of night appeared really approaching,"
4761,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,As quick shade after shade on his light came encroaching.
4762,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,
4763,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"But, wearied now, the rain gives o'er the fight,"
4764,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Though thundering clouds have not expended quite
4765,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Their rumbling yet; and oft the forkèd light
4766,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Illumes the stream, which to the friar shows"
4767,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,How high the waters o'er its margin flows.
4768,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,
4769,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"It is supper-time now, and a fish growing bold,"
4770,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,On the bait as it neared him caught suddenly hold.
4771,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"How the fisherman grins as the cord outward rolled,"
4772,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Though he shivers, and all his teeth chatter with cold."
4773,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"""How it runs! how it runs! like an arrow it flies!"
4774,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"I am certain,"" he said; ""'tis a fish of great size."
4775,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"For my patience, though late, I shall still gain a prize."
4776,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Sure, I think, it down straight"
4777,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Must have swallowed the bait;
4778,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"For, of line but a few yards are left."
4779,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"I must strike, or I fear"
4780,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"They will too, disappear,"
4781,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"And he then may walk off with his theft."""
4782,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"'Twas a capital stroke,"
4783,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"But his top-joint he broke,"
4784,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,So he seizes the line with his hand.
4785,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"And then works it about,"
4786,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Till he's tired quite out,"
4787,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,For the fish seems averse to the land.
4788,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"""Patience, patience!"" he said,"
4789,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Talking inside his head;
4790,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"""Have you not tried for hours, and have yet taken naught?"
4791,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Then be patient and wait,"
4792,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Though it p'rhaps may be late,"
4793,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Still the fish at the end of your line is half caught."""
4794,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,
4795,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"An hour passed, and every gleam of light"
4796,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Flies, with the sun afraid of gloomy night."
4797,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Yet still our friend is in the selfsame plight,"
4798,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"The fish is lively, though he's wearied quite."
4799,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"And shakes, not now with cold alone, but fright,"
4800,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,For every tree he fancies is a sprite.
4801,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"His sport, I fear, is not unmix'd delight."
4802,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"He once or twice had drawn the line up tight,"
4803,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"And thought by strength to drag the fish out right,"
4804,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"But feared that, p'rhaps, it like the other might"
4805,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Escape; so slackening, granted a respite"
4806,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"To Jack, who, rushing forth with new delight,"
4807,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Seemed much astonished at this act polite.
4808,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,
4809,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Another hour! and lively as before
4810,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"The pike appears; while Peter, wearied sore,"
4811,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"With itching fingers longs his fate to try,"
4812,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Yet dares not stand the hazard of the die.
4813,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"But with a dash the fish the die has cast,"
4814,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,For through his hand the slippery line ran fast;
4815,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"And, tangling 'mongst his fingers, drew him close"
4816,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"The rapid stream; which o'er its banks had rose,"
4817,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"A slip, a plunge, headforemost in the tide"
4818,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,He dived; then rising--vainly struggling--tried
4819,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,To reach the bank; but not a ray of light
4820,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,Appeared to guide; so deeper in his fright
4821,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"He sank; while waves fast closing o'er his head,"
4822,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"In murmurings whispered, that all hope had fled."
4823,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,"Then down the stream, still powerful and strong,"
4824,_CHAPTER THE EIGHTH._,The fish his breathless body drags along.

4830,_MORAL._,"Now in case that my tale may to some appear dry,"
4831,_MORAL._,"I will draw some more-ales,--fine old ones, by the bye;"
4832,_MORAL._,"Though, I fear, there are many who will not admire them,"
4833,_MORAL._,As they suit not those palates who mostly require them.
4834,_MORAL._,"First, young gentlemen all, never mind what degree,"
4835,_MORAL._,"Whether lowly or high, or whoever you be,"
4836,_MORAL._,"If you're but fond of fishing, I beg that you'll tricks shun;"
4837,_MORAL._,"If you're not, you're beneath me and my jurisdiction."
4838,_MORAL._,"Still I'll draw you a glass which will pay for inspection,"
4839,_MORAL._,As whene'er it is looked at it yields some reflexion.
4840,_MORAL._,"Though the draught may be bitter, the faculty back it,"
4841,_MORAL._,"So just make up your mind,--a bold face, and stomach it;"
4842,_MORAL._,"For there's more in the dose than aware of you are,"
4843,_MORAL._,As the old ancient said when he poisoned his Ma.
4844,_MORAL._,"My advice, if wishing"
4845,_MORAL._,"You are to go fishing,"
4846,_MORAL._,Is beforehand permission to get
4847,_MORAL._,"From your father, or master,"
4848,_MORAL._,"Or, if such things you past are,"
4849,_MORAL._,"You had better, I think, seek it yet"
4850,_MORAL._,"From the man in possession,"
4851,_MORAL._,Who might use some expression
4852,_MORAL._,"Unpolite, if by chance he you met"
4853,_MORAL._,"Treading down his long grass,"
4854,_MORAL._,In your hurry to pass
4855,_MORAL._,"To the river, your tackle to wet."
4856,_MORAL._,"Oh, it vexes one sore to be ordered to go!"
4857,_MORAL._,Quick to make one's self scarce! I have oft found it so;
4858,_MORAL._,"And have felt much inclined, as I quarrelled with Fate,"
4859,_MORAL._,To chuck in the old fellow instead of ground bait.
4860,_MORAL._,"But, if haply you 'scape from his telescope sight"
4861,_MORAL._,You will ever be losing some relishing bite
4862,_MORAL._,"While your gazing around, as he probably might"
4863,_MORAL._,"(Popping upon you unseen), make you jump in a fright."
4864,_MORAL._,
4865,_MORAL._,Now to those men who dare
4866,_MORAL._,"Fish on Sundays--""Beware,"""
4867,_MORAL._,"I would say; ""and take very great care"
4868,_MORAL._,"Lest a fish of great size,"
4869,_MORAL._,"Take you off by surprise,"
4870,_MORAL._,"And before you're aware should effect your demise."""
4871,_MORAL._,"But, a few words to anglers in general, still"
4872,_MORAL._,"I would say, ere my inkstand I close, then my quill"
4873,_MORAL._,"Must return to his duty, and figure away,"
4874,_MORAL._,And keep humbly a-summing accounts which won't pay:
4875,_MORAL._,"If a fish should get loose,"
4876,_MORAL._,"Which, p'rhaps, grumblers may choose,"
4877,_MORAL._,"From your line, what's the use,"
4878,_MORAL._,"May I ask, of abuse,"
4879,_MORAL._,Though it may be the largest has broken away?
4880,_MORAL._,Will an oath for a moment persuade it to stay?
4881,_MORAL._,"You remind me of perch, who, regardless of Fate,"
4882,_MORAL._,Often bite at a hook though quite guiltless of bait;
4883,_MORAL._,"So that anglers who angry become when they roam,"
4884,_MORAL._,Lest their tempers they lose had best leave them at home.
4885,_MORAL._,"As to low vulgar jests, which some think wit impart,"
4886,_MORAL._,They appear like the muck which o'erflows a mud cart.
4887,_MORAL._,"It is strange, though a fact, that a fisherman ever,"
4888,_MORAL._,"Although skilful he be, and remarkably clever,"
4889,_MORAL._,"Will be forced to confess, when by questions he's crossed,"
4890,_MORAL._,That the largest of fish in its landing was lost.
4891,_MORAL._,"Yes, 'tis always the best 'mong a number will stray,"
4892,_MORAL._,"Or get lost, let the articles be what they may."
4893,_MORAL._,"I, in even a buss, have oft proved that 'tis so,"
4894,_MORAL._,For the prettiest girl would be sure first to go.
4895,_MORAL._,
4896,_MORAL._,But a few moments more
4897,_MORAL._,"I for patience implore,--"
4898,_MORAL._,In behalf of your victims I speak;
4899,_MORAL._,And would beg when you draw
4900,_MORAL._,"Them up on to the shore,"
4901,_MORAL._,You at once for their lifetime would seek.
4902,_MORAL._,"Still, kind Reader, think not, though it so, p'rhaps, may look,"
4903,_MORAL._,"I'm like Johnson, who wrote out that fine-meaning book,"
4904,_MORAL._,"Who would angling define as a stick and a string,"
4905,_MORAL._,Which a worm and a fool into close contact bring.
4906,_MORAL._,"No! The sport I admire, and when the fish will but bite,"
4907,_MORAL._,'Tis a feeling which almost amounts to delight.
4908,_MORAL._,"Though a trifling addition will heighten, indeed,"
4909,_MORAL._,"The pleasure, I mean, if some nice girl would read"
4910,_MORAL._,"Out aloud by your side, and would shadow your eyes"
4911,_MORAL._,"From the sun, and away drive the flies"
4912,_MORAL._,"With her neat parasol. I have asked, but must state"
4913,_MORAL._,I could never persuade one to stick on the bait.
4914,_MORAL._,Though some ladies I know who can pull out a fish
4915,_MORAL._,With as much skill and science as Walton could wish.
4916,_MORAL._,
4917,_MORAL._,"Kind Reader, now, my parting bow"
4918,_MORAL._,"With many thanks I make,"
4919,_MORAL._,"For patience shown; though, overgrown,"
4920,_MORAL._,Much space the morals take.
4921,_MORAL._,"Still, I beg to remark, they're not meant for you,"
4922,_MORAL._,"Who have quietly waded their deep meaning through,"
4923,_MORAL._,"But for those who exclaim, ""O what humbug! what stuff!"""
4924,_MORAL._,"Who, though not at all wise, find one word quite enough."
