143,I,I
144,I,
145,I,He sang above the vineyards of the world.
146,I,And after him the vines with woven hands
147,I,"Clambered and clung, and everywhere unfurled"
148,I,Triumphing green above the barren lands;
149,I,"Till high as gardens grow, he climbed, he stood,"
150,I,"Sun-crowned with life and strength, and singing toil,"
151,I,And looked upon his work; and it was good:
152,I,"The corn, the wine, the oil."
153,I,
154,I,He sang above the noon. The topmost cleft
155,I,That grudged him footing on the mountain scars
156,I,He planted and despaired not; till he left
157,I,His vines soft breathing to the host of stars.
158,I,"He wrought, he tilled; and even as he sang,"
159,I,The creatures of his planting laughed to scorn
160,I,The ancient threat of deserts where there sprang
161,I,"The wine, the oil, the corn!"
162,I,
163,I,He sang not for abundance.--Over-lords
164,I,"Took of his tilth. Yet was there still to reap,"
165,I,The portion of his labor; dear rewards
166,I,"Of sunlit day, and bread, and human sleep."
167,I,He sang for strength; for glory of the light.
168,I,"He dreamed above the furrows, 'They are mine!'"
169,I,When all he wrought stood fair before his sight
170,I,"With corn, and oil, and wine."
171,I,
172,I,"_Truly, the light is sweet"
173,I,"Yea, and a pleasant thing"
174,I,It is to see the Sun.
175,I,And that a man should eat
176,I,His bread that he hath won;--
177,I,"(So is it sung and said),"
178,I,"That he should take and keep,"
179,I,"After his laboring,"
180,I,"The portion of his labor in his bread,"
181,I,His bread that he hath won;
182,I,"Yea, and in quiet sleep,"
183,I,When all is done._
184,I,
185,I,"He sang; above the burden and the heat,"
186,I,Above all seasons with their fitful grace;
187,I,Above the chance and change that led his feet
188,I,To this last ambush of the Market-place.
189,I,"'Enough for him,' they said--and still they say--"
190,I,"'A crust, with air to breathe, and sun to shine;"
191,I,He asks no more!'--Before they took away
192,I,"The corn, the oil, the wine."
193,I,
194,I,"He sang. No more he sings now, anywhere."
195,I,"Light was enough, before he was undone."
196,I,"They knew it well, who took away the air,"
197,I,--Who took away the sun;
198,I,"Who took, to serve their soul-devouring greed,"
199,I,"Himself, his breath, his bread--the goad of toil;--"
200,I,"Who have and hold, before the eyes of Need,"
201,I,"The corn, the wine,--the oil!"
202,I,
203,I,"_Truly, one thing is sweet"
204,I,Of things beneath the Sun;
205,I,"This, that a man should earn his bread and eat,"
206,I,Rejoicing in his work which he hath done.
207,I,What shall be sung or said
208,I,Of desolate deceit.
209,I,When others take his bread;
210,I,His and his children's bread?--
211,I,And the laborer hath none.
212,I,"This, for his portion now, of all that he hath done."
213,I,He earns; and others eat.
214,I,He starves;--they sit at meat
215,I,Who have taken away the Sun._
216,I,
217,I,
218,II,II
219,II,
220,II,"Seek him now, that singing Man."
221,II,"Look for him,"
222,II,Look for him
223,II,"In the mills,"
224,II,In the mines;
225,II,"Where the very daylight pines,--"
226,II,"He, who once did walk the hills!"
227,II,"You shall find him, if you scan"
228,II,"Shapes all unbefitting Man,"
229,II,"Bodies warped, and faces dim."
230,II,In the mines; in the mills
231,II,Where the ceaseless thunder fills
232,II,Spaces of the human brain
233,II,Till all thought is turned to pain.
234,II,"Where the skirl of wheel on wheel,"
235,II,"Grinding him who is their tool,"
236,II,Makes the shattered senses reel
237,II,To the numbness of the fool.
238,II,"Perisht thought, and halting tongue"
239,II,(Once it spoke;--once it sung!)
240,II,"Live to hunger, dead to song."
241,II,Only heart-beats loud with wrong
242,II,"Hammer on,--_How long_?"
243,II,... _How long_?--_How long_?
244,II,
245,II,Search for him;
246,II,Search for him;
247,II,Where the crazy atoms swim
248,II,Up the fiery furnace-blast.
249,II,"You shall find him, at the last,--"
250,II,"He whose forehead braved the sun,--"
251,II,Wreckt and tortured and undone.
252,II,Where no breath across the heat
253,II,Whispers him that life was sweet;
254,II,"But the sparkles mock and flare,"
255,II,Scattering up the crooked air.
256,II,"(Blackened with that bitter mirk,--"
257,II,Would God know His handiwork?)
258,II,
259,II,Thought is not for such as he;
260,II,"Naught but strength, and misery;"
261,II,"Since, for just the bite and sup,"
262,II,Life must needs be swallowed up.
263,II,"Only, reeling up the sky,"
264,II,"Hurtling flames that hurry by,"
265,II,"Gasp and flare, with _Why_--_Why_,"
266,II,... _Why_?...
267,II,
268,II,Why the human mind of him
269,II,"Shrinks, and falters and is dim"
270,II,When he tries to make it out:
271,II,What the torture is about.--
272,II,"Why he breathes, a fugitive"
273,II,Whom the World forbids to live.
274,II,"Why he earned for his abode,"
275,II,Habitation of the toad!
276,II,Why his fevered day by day
277,II,Will not serve to drive away
278,II,Horror that must always haunt:--
279,II,... _Want_ ... _Want_!
280,II,Nightmare shot with waking pangs;--
281,II,"Tightening coil, and certain fangs,"
282,II,"Close and closer, always nigh ..."
283,II,... _Why_?... _Why_?
284,II,
285,II,Why he labors under ban
286,II,That denies him for a man.
287,II,Why his utmost drop of blood
288,II,Buys for him no human good;
289,II,Why his utmost urge of strength
290,II,Only lets Them starve at length;--
291,II,Will not let him starve alone;
292,II,"He must watch, and see his own"
293,II,"Fade and fail, and starve, and die."

301,II,"Heart-beats, in a hammering song,"
302,II,"Heavy as an ox may plod,"
303,II,"Goaded--goaded--faint with wrong,"
304,II,Cry unto some ghost of God

310,III,
311,III,Seek him yet. Search for him!
312,III,"You shall find him, spent and grim;"
313,III,"In the prisons, where we pen"
314,III,These unsightly shards of men.
315,III,Sheltered fast;
316,III,Housed at length;
317,III,"Clothed and fed, no matter how!--"
318,III,"Where the householders, aghast,"
319,III,Measure in his broken strength
320,III,"Nought but power for evil, now."
321,III,Beast-of-burden drudgeries
322,III,Could not earn him what was his:
323,III,He who heard the world applaud
324,III,"Glories seized by force and fraud,"
325,III,"He must break,--he must take!--"
326,III,Both for hate and hunger's sake.
327,III,He must seize by fraud and force;
328,III,"He must strike, without remorse!"
329,III,Seize he might; but never keep.
330,III,"Strike, his once!--Behold him here."
331,III,"(Human life we buy so cheap,"
332,III,Who should know we held it dear?)
333,III,
334,III,"No denial,--no defence"
335,III,"From a brain bereft of sense,"
336,III,Any more than penitence.
337,III,"But the heart-beats now, that plod"
338,III,"Goaded--goaded--dumb with wrong,"
339,III,Ask not even a ghost of God
340,III,............._How long_?
341,III,
342,III,"_When the Sea gives up its dead,"
343,III,"Prison caverns, yield instead"
344,III,"This, rejected and despised;"
345,III,"This, the Soiled and Sacrificed!"
346,III,Without form or comeliness;
347,III,Shamed for us that did transgress;
348,III,"Bruised, for our iniquities,"
349,III,With the stripes that are all his!
350,III,"Face that wreckage, you who can."
351,III,It was once the Singing Man._
352,III,
353,III,
354,IV,IV
355,IV,
356,IV,Must it be?--Must we then
357,IV,Render back to God again
358,IV,"This His broken work, this thing,"
359,IV,For His man that once did sing?
360,IV,Will not all our wonders do?
361,IV,"Gifts we stored the ages through,"
362,IV,(Trusting that He had forgot)--
363,IV,Gifts the Lord requirèd not?
364,IV,
365,IV,Would the all-but-human serve!
366,IV,Monsters made of stone and nerve;

451,I,To sun themselves at ease;

471,II,"That once sold doves,--now grown so pennywise"
472,II,"To bargain with forlorner merchandise,--"
473,II,"They buy and sell, they buy and sell again,"
474,II,The life-long toil of men.
475,II,Worn with their market strife to dispossess
476,II,"The blind,--the fatherless,"

478,II,And woods with beckoning wonders new unfurled.

524,IV,"And if you take some Old One to the fields,"

550,IV,Even as they breathed and clung!
551,IV,"Lost lilies, bruised and sodden;"

553,IV,Where misery blasphemes the sacred young!
554,IV,"Mute outcry, most, of those"

955,THE FEASTER,Charm me some rare anointment I may trust
956,THE FEASTER,"Against her query, searching like a barb"
957,THE FEASTER,The dumbness of a heart unreconciled.
958,THE FEASTER,Clothe me with silver; fold me from dismay;
959,THE FEASTER,"Save me from pity. For I hear her say,"
960,THE FEASTER,"'Alas, Alas, poor child!'"
961,THE FEASTER,
962,THE FEASTER,"'Alas, Alas, thou lost poor child, how long?"
963,THE FEASTER,Why wilt thou suffer want?

965,THE FEASTER,And see thine eyes grow gaunt?
966,THE FEASTER,Making sad feast upon the crumbs of light
967,THE FEASTER,Shed long ago from heavenly highways where
968,THE FEASTER,Thy brethren are!
969,THE FEASTER,"And thy heart smoulders in thee, to be bright,"
970,THE FEASTER,"Thy one sole refuge from thy one despair,"
971,THE FEASTER,Fraying the thwarted body with a scar.

1172,THE PROPHET,And the shadow of the cloud

1174,THE PROPHET,
1175,THE PROPHET,"Where he dipped the water's cool,"
1176,THE PROPHET,"Filling boyish hands from thence,"
1177,THE PROPHET,Something breathed across the pool
1178,THE PROPHET,Stir of sweet enlightenments;
1179,THE PROPHET,"And he drank, with thirsty sense,"

1227,THE PROPHET,"Heart's-desire, from day to day."
1228,THE PROPHET,"But their eyes, some foreign way,"
1229,THE PROPHET,Looked at him; and he was still.
1230,THE PROPHET,
1231,THE PROPHET,"Last, he reached his arms to sleep,"
1232,THE PROPHET,"Where the Vision waited, dim,"
1233,THE PROPHET,Still beyond some deep-on-deep.

1695,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Most for his sake we dreamed. Tho' not as he,"
1696,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"From that lone spirit, brimmed with human woe,"
1697,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Your song once shook to surging overflow.
1698,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"How was it, sovran dweller of the tree,"
1699,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"His cry, still throbbing in the flooded shell"
1700,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Of silence with remembered melody,"
1701,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Could draw from you no answer to the spell?
1702,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"--O Voice, O Philomel?"
1703,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,
1704,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Long time we wondered (and we knew not why):--
1705,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Nor dream, nor prayer, of wayside gladness born,"
1706,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Nor vineyards waiting, nor reproachful thorn,"
1707,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Nor yet the nested hill-towns set so high
1708,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"All the white way beside the girdling blue,--"
1709,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Nor olives, gray against a golden sky,"
1710,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Could serve to wake that rapturous voice of you!
1711,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,But the wise silence knew.
1712,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,
1713,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"O Nightingale unheard!--Unheard alone,"
1714,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Throughout that woven music of the days
1715,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"From the faint sea-rim to the market-place,"
1716,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,And ring of hammers on cathedral stone!--
1717,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"So be it, better so: that there should fail"
1718,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"For sun-filled ones, one blessèd thing unknown."
1719,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"To them, be hid forever,--and all hail!"
1720,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Sing never, Nightingale."
1721,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,
1722,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Sing, for the others! Sing; to some pale cheek"
1723,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Against the window, like a starving flower."
1724,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Loose, with your singing, one poor pilgrim hour"
1725,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Of journey, with some Heart's Desire to seek."
1726,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Loose, with your singing, captives such as these"
1727,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"In misery and iron, hearts too meek,"
1728,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,For voyage--voyage over dreamful seas
1729,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,To lost Hesperides.
1730,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,
1731,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Sing not for free-men. Ah, but sing for whom"
1732,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"The walls shut in; and even as eyes that fade,"
1733,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"The windows take no heed of light nor shade,--"
1734,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,The leaves are lost in mutterings of the loom.
1735,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Sing near! So in that golden overflowing
1736,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,They may forget their wasted human bloom;
1737,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Pay the devouring days their all, unknowing.--"
1738,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Reck not of life's bright going!
1739,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,
1740,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Sing not for lovers, side by side that hark;"
1741,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Nor unto parted lovers, save they be"
1742,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Parted indeed by more than makes the Sea.
1743,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Where never hope shall meet--like mounting lark--
1744,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Far Joy's uprising; and no memories
1745,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Abide to star the music-haunted dark:
1746,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"To them that sit in darkness, such as these,"
1747,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Pour down, pour down heart's-ease."
1748,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,
1749,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Not in kings' gardens. No; but where there haunt
1750,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"The world's forgotten, both of men and birds;"
1751,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"The alleys of no hope and of no words,"
1752,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"The hidings where men reap not, though they plant;"
1753,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,But toil and thirst--so dying and so born;--
1754,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"And toil and thirst to gather to their want,"
1755,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"From the lean waste, beyond the daylight's scorn,"
1756,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,--To gather grapes of thorn!
1757,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,
1758,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,*       *       *       *       *
1759,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,
1760,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"And for those two, your pilgrims without tears,"
1761,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Who prayed a largess where there was no dearth,"
1762,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Forgive it to their human-happy ears:
1763,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Forgive it them, brown music of the Earth,"
1764,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Unknowing,--though the wiser silence knew!"
1765,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,Forgive it to the music of the spheres
1766,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"That while they walked together so, the Two"
1767,THE NIGHTINGALE UNHEARD,"Together,--heard not you."
