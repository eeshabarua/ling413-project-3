1622,FORGIVENESS,"Humbled and happy bows itself to Thee,"
1623,FORGIVENESS,Pleading that all its error and its sin
1624,FORGIVENESS,May be forgiven--even as I forgive.
1625,FORGIVENESS,
1626,FORGIVENESS,The cruel wrong swept o'er me like a flood;
1627,FORGIVENESS,"And my hurt soul in fierce defiance rose,"
1628,FORGIVENESS,And all forgetful that itself could sin
1629,FORGIVENESS,Heaped heavy hatred on the offender's head.
1630,FORGIVENESS,There came a calmer hour in which I saw
1631,FORGIVENESS,The strong temptation that had moved him thus
1632,FORGIVENESS,To barter all his better life away--
1633,FORGIVENESS,"Love, honor, principle--to gain the world."
1634,FORGIVENESS,And seeing this I learned to pity him.

1637,FORGIVENESS,And well I knew the golden fruit he grasped

1640,FORGIVENESS,And as my pity grew it turned to prayer--
1641,FORGIVENESS,"That when the glitter of the gold was gone,"
1642,FORGIVENESS,And the sweet fruit was bitter to his taste;
1643,FORGIVENESS,When the sad memory of the slighted past
1644,FORGIVENESS,"Came, and made deeper still the present gloom,"
1645,FORGIVENESS,"The darkness might be lifted, and the Soul,"

1650,FORGIVENESS,But suddenly I queried in my heart
1651,FORGIVENESS,What power had moved me that I should have prayed
1652,FORGIVENESS,For him I counted as my life-long foe.
1653,FORGIVENESS,Greatly I marveled what it meant that thus
1654,FORGIVENESS,I had called down such blessing upon him--
1655,FORGIVENESS,"The kindliest boon of heaven, the peace of God."
1656,FORGIVENESS,Deep in my soul there came an answering voice:

2412,MARGARET LEE,
2413,MARGARET LEE,Margaret Lee--you do not know her?
2414,MARGARET LEE,Rightly named--a pearl is she;
2415,MARGARET LEE,Half a score of years I've loved her--
2416,MARGARET LEE,Precious Margaret Lee.
2417,MARGARET LEE,
2418,MARGARET LEE,"""Dimples?"" No; nor ""golden tresses,"""
2419,MARGARET LEE,"Nor yet ""voice of silvery tone"";--"
2420,MARGARET LEE,"If such phrases must express her,"
2421,MARGARET LEE,Beauty she has none.
2422,MARGARET LEE,
2423,MARGARET LEE,Soft brown hair and grey eyes dreaming
2424,MARGARET LEE,Visions that none others see;
2425,MARGARET LEE,Plain her features; _you_ might call her
2426,MARGARET LEE,Homely Margaret Lee.
2427,MARGARET LEE,
2428,MARGARET LEE,"Margaret owns no stately mansion,"
2429,MARGARET LEE,Carries not a heavy purse;
2430,MARGARET LEE,"Heiress to no ""lordly acres,"""
2431,MARGARET LEE,Humble station hers.
2432,MARGARET LEE,
2433,MARGARET LEE,Quietly she treads life's highway;
2434,MARGARET LEE,"Quiet, yet with noble mien;"
2435,MARGARET LEE,"'Mid the lowly, 'mid the lofty"
2436,MARGARET LEE,Journeying like a queen.
2437,MARGARET LEE,
2438,MARGARET LEE,"Some have called her cold and haughty,"
2439,MARGARET LEE,"From her bearing, high and free;"
2440,MARGARET LEE,Some have said a lofty spirit
2441,MARGARET LEE,Dwells with Margaret Lee.
2442,MARGARET LEE,
2443,MARGARET LEE,"Why then do the ""heavy-laden"""
2444,MARGARET LEE,Hail with joy her coming nigh?
2445,MARGARET LEE,Why the childern love her shadow
2446,MARGARET LEE,As she passeth by?
2447,MARGARET LEE,
2448,MARGARET LEE,"Some have deemed her weak, erratic."
2449,MARGARET LEE,"Some, too self-reliant, strong;"
2450,MARGARET LEE,"One avers, her mood too gloomy;"
2451,MARGARET LEE,"One, too light her song."
2452,MARGARET LEE,
2453,MARGARET LEE,All may be; the clouds of error
2454,MARGARET LEE,"Ofttimes overshade her way,"
2455,MARGARET LEE,Hiding where the rough and changeful
2456,MARGARET LEE,Paths of duty lay.
2457,MARGARET LEE,
2458,MARGARET LEE,But unseen by mortal vision
2459,MARGARET LEE,Daily bends a suppliant knee;
2460,MARGARET LEE,Humbly bows a contrite spirit--
2461,MARGARET LEE,Praying Margaret Lee--
2462,MARGARET LEE,
2463,MARGARET LEE,Asking of the All-forgiving
2464,MARGARET LEE,Pardon for her erring life;
2465,MARGARET LEE,"Seeking wisdom, faith and patience"
2466,MARGARET LEE,For its coming strife.
2467,MARGARET LEE,
2468,MARGARET LEE,"So with footstep sometimes faltering,"
2469,MARGARET LEE,"But with steadfast hope in God,"
2470,MARGARET LEE,Keeps she still a blithesome journey
2471,MARGARET LEE,O'er the earthly road.
2472,MARGARET LEE,
2473,MARGARET LEE,And at last all loss and failure
2474,MARGARET LEE,"Lost in mercy, it may be"
2475,MARGARET LEE,Heaven's gate of pearl will open
2476,MARGARET LEE,For sweet Margaret Lee.
2477,MARGARET LEE,
2478,MARGARET LEE,"There redeemed from sin and sorrow,"
2479,MARGARET LEE,There from care and conflict free;
2480,MARGARET LEE,"She will walk the angel city,"
2481,MARGARET LEE,Angel Margaret Lee.

2486,SOARING UPWARD,SOARING UPWARD
2487,SOARING UPWARD,
2488,SOARING UPWARD,
2489,SOARING UPWARD,"A. G. M., lingering on the threshold of eternity, looked lovingly"
2490,SOARING UPWARD,"back to tell of the glory revealed to her purified vision. ""Angels are"
2491,SOARING UPWARD,"waiting,"" she whispered, ""and all is beautiful, beautiful."" Then, as"
2492,SOARING UPWARD,"her spirit winged its happy way, a sweet murmur again was heard,"
2493,SOARING UPWARD,"and the words were: ""Soaring upward, upward into Heaven."""
2494,SOARING UPWARD,
2495,SOARING UPWARD,"They call thee dead. They say that thou art gone,"
2496,SOARING UPWARD,Forevermore from earth. It is not so;
2497,SOARING UPWARD,I know thy gentle spirit will return
2498,SOARING UPWARD,And linger fondly round the loved below.
2499,SOARING UPWARD,
2500,SOARING UPWARD,They call thee dead. And now thou art not ours;
2501,SOARING UPWARD,"""God touched thee,"" for thy work on earth was done."
2502,SOARING UPWARD,Thy presence was to us like summer flowers;
2503,SOARING UPWARD,And they are faded now; and thou art gone.
2504,SOARING UPWARD,
2505,SOARING UPWARD,"I had not thought, fair girl, that thou couldst die;"
2506,SOARING UPWARD,"I knew thee gentle, innocent and gay;"
2507,SOARING UPWARD,"And dreamed not that the brightness of thine eye,"
2508,SOARING UPWARD,Was destined thus so soon to fade away.
2509,SOARING UPWARD,
2510,SOARING UPWARD,"'Tis well: ""He giveth His beloved sleep,""--"
2511,SOARING UPWARD,"O Sleeper, thou so early loved and blest!"
2512,SOARING UPWARD,"Say, were it wrong, if we who linger weep,"
2513,SOARING UPWARD,"And long to sleep, like thee, and be at rest?"
2514,SOARING UPWARD,
2515,SOARING UPWARD,"Ay, we who linger should not idlers be;"
2516,SOARING UPWARD,Day hath appointed work from morn till even;
2517,SOARING UPWARD,And while we wait 'tis sweet to think of thee
2518,SOARING UPWARD,"As ""soaring upward, upward into heaven!"""
