27,CHATTO & WINDUS,"_The following collection of verses_, _written at various times and"
28,CHATTO & WINDUS,"places_, _principally after the author's final departure from England in_"
29,CHATTO & WINDUS,"1887, _was sent home by him for publication some months before his"
30,CHATTO & WINDUS,death_.  _He had tried them in several different orders and under several
31,CHATTO & WINDUS,"different titles_, _as_ ""_Songs and Notes of Travel_,"" ""_Posthumous"
32,CHATTO & WINDUS,"Poems_,"" _etc._, _and in the end left their naming and arrangement to the"
33,CHATTO & WINDUS,"present editor_, _with the suggestion that they should be added as Book"
34,CHATTO & WINDUS,"III. to future editions of_ ""_Underwoods_.""  _This suggestion it is"
35,CHATTO & WINDUS,"proposed to carry out_; _but in the meantime_, _for the benefit of those"
36,CHATTO & WINDUS,"who possess_ ""_Underwoods_"" _in its original form_, _it has been thought"
37,CHATTO & WINDUS,desirable to publish them separately in the present volume_.  _They have
38,CHATTO & WINDUS,already been included in the Edinburgh Edition of the author's works_.

155,I--THE VAGABOND,
156,I--THE VAGABOND,"Let the blow fall soon or late,"
157,I--THE VAGABOND,Let what will be o'er me;

159,I--THE VAGABOND,And the road before me.
160,I--THE VAGABOND,"Wealth I seek not, hope nor love,"

164,I--THE VAGABOND,
165,I--THE VAGABOND,Or let autumn fall on me
166,I--THE VAGABOND,"Where afield I linger,"
167,I--THE VAGABOND,"Silencing the bird on tree,"
168,I--THE VAGABOND,Biting the blue finger.

235,IV,The unremembered tokens in your hand
236,IV,Avail no more.
237,IV,
238,IV,"No more the morning glow, no more the grace,"
239,IV,"Enshrines, endears."
240,IV,Cold beats the light of time upon your face
241,IV,And shows your tears.

243,IV,He came and went.  Perchance you wept a while

279,VI,
280,VI,"I saw them distant as heaven,"
281,VI,"Dumb and shining and dead,"
282,VI,And the idle stars of the night
283,VI,Were dearer to me than bread.
284,VI,
285,VI,Night after night in my sorrow
286,VI,"The stars stood over the sea,"
287,VI,Till lo!  I looked in the dusk

298,VII,"Her love appeared, appealed for mine,"
299,VII,And wantoned in her eyes.
300,VII,
301,VII,Clear as the shining tapers burned
302,VII,"On Cytherea's shrine,"
303,VII,"Those brimming, lustrous beauties turned,"
304,VII,And called and conquered mine.
305,VII,
306,VII,The beacon-lamp that Hero lit
307,VII,"No fairer shone on sea,"
308,VII,"No plainlier summoned will and wit,"
309,VII,Than hers encouraged me.
310,VII,
311,VII,"I thrilled to feel her influence near,"
312,VII,I struck my flag at sight.
313,VII,Her starry silence smote my ear
314,VII,Like sudden drums at night.
315,VII,
316,VII,"I ran as, at the cannon's roar,"
317,VII,The troops the ramparts man--
318,VII,As in the holy house of yore
319,VII,The willing Eli ran.
320,VII,
321,VII,"Here, lady, lo! that servant stands"
322,VII,"You picked from passing men,"

336,VIII,For her of duskier lustre
337,VIII,"Whose favour still I wear,"
338,VIII,"The snow be in her kirtle,"
339,VIII,The rose be in her hair!
340,VIII,
341,VIII,The hue of highland rivers
342,VIII,"Careering, full and cool,"
343,VIII,"From sable on to golden,"
344,VIII,From rapid on to pool--
345,VIII,"The hue of heather-honey,"
346,VIII,"The hue of honey-bees,"
347,VIII,"Shall tinge her golden shoulder,"
348,VIII,Shall gild her tawny knees.

364,IX,Awake in the crimson eve!

368,IX,To render again and receive!

383,X,One pebble in our path--one star

400,XI,Of green days in forests and blue days at sea.
401,XI,
402,XI,"I will make my kitchen, and you shall keep your room,"
403,XI,"Where white flows the river and bright blows the broom,"
404,XI,And you shall wash your linen and keep your body white
405,XI,In rainfall at morning and dewfall at night.
406,XI,
407,XI,"And this shall be for music when no one else is near,"
408,XI,"The fine song for singing, the rare song to hear!"
409,XI,"That only I remember, that only you admire,"
410,XI,Of the broad road that stretches and the roadside fire.

477,XIV,Bright is the ring of words
478,XIV,"When the right man rings them,"
479,XIV,Fair the fall of songs
480,XIV,When the singer sings them.
481,XIV,Still they are carolled and said--
482,XIV,On wings they are carried--
483,XIV,After the singer is dead
484,XIV,And the maker buried.
485,XIV,
486,XIV,Low as the singer lies
487,XIV,"In the field of heather,"
488,XIV,Songs of his fashion bring
489,XIV,The swains together.
490,XIV,And when the west is red
491,XIV,"With the sunset embers,"

493,XIV,And the maid remembers.

1327,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"In all the grove, nor stream nor bird"
1328,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Nor aught beside my blows was heard,"
1329,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,And the woods wore their noonday dress--
1330,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,The glory of their silentness.
1331,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"From the island summit to the seas,"
1332,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Trees mounted, and trees drooped, and trees"
1333,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Groped upward in the gaps.  The green
1334,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Inarboured talus and ravine
1335,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,By fathoms.  By the multitude
1336,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,The rugged columns of the wood
1337,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,And bunches of the branches stood;
1338,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Thick as a mob, deep as a sea,"
1339,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,And silent as eternity.
1340,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"With lowered axe, with backward head,"
1341,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Late from this scene my labourer fled,"
1342,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"And with a ravelled tale to tell,"
1343,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Returned.  Some denizen of hell,"
1344,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Dead man or disinvested god,"
1345,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Had close behind him peered and trod,"
1346,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,And triumphed when he turned to flee.
1347,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,How different fell the lines with me!
1348,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Whose eye explored the dim arcade
1349,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Impatient of the uncoming shade--
1350,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Shy elf, or dryad pale and cold,"
1351,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Or mystic lingerer from of old:
1352,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Vainly.  The fair and stately things,"
1353,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Impassive as departed kings,"
1354,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"All still in the wood's stillness stood,"
1355,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,And dumb.  The rooted multitude
1356,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Nodded and brooded, bloomed and dreamed,"
1357,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Unmeaning, undivined.  It seemed"
1358,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"No other art, no hope, they knew,"
1359,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Than clutch the earth and seek the blue.
1360,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,'Mid vegetable king and priest
1361,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"And stripling, I (the only beast)"
1362,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Was at the beast's work, killing; hewed"
1363,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"The stubborn roots across, bestrewed"
1364,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"The glebe with the dislustred leaves,"
1365,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,And bade the saplings fall in sheaves;
1366,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Bursting across the tangled math
1367,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"A ruin that I called a path,"
1368,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"A Golgotha that, later on,"
1369,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"When rains had watered, and suns shone,"
1370,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"And seeds enriched the place, should bear"
1371,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"And be called garden.  Here and there,"
1372,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,I spied and plucked by the green hair
1373,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"A foe more resolute to live,"
1374,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,The toothed and killing sensitive.
1375,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"He, semi-conscious, fled the attack;"
1376,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,He shrank and tucked his branches back;
1377,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"And straining by his anchor-strand,"
1378,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Captured and scratched the rooting hand.
1379,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"I saw him crouch, I felt him bite;"
1380,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,And straight my eyes were touched with sight.
1381,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,I saw the wood for what it was:
1382,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"The lost and the victorious cause,"
1383,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"The deadly battle pitched in line,"
1384,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Saw silent weapons cross and shine:
1385,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Silent defeat, silent assault,"
1386,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,A battle and a burial vault.
1387,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,
1388,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Thick round me in the teeming mud
1389,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Brier and fern strove to the blood:
1390,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,The hooked liana in his gin
1391,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Noosed his reluctant neighbours in:
1392,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"There the green murderer throve and spread,"
1393,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Upon his smothering victims fed,"
1394,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,And wantoned on his climbing coil.
1395,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Contending roots fought for the soil
1396,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Like frightened demons: with despair
1397,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Competing branches pushed for air.
1398,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Green conquerors from overhead
1399,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Bestrode the bodies of their dead:
1400,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"The Caesars of the sylvan field,"
1401,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Unused to fail, foredoomed to yield:"
1402,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"For in the groins of branches, lo!"
1403,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,The cancers of the orchid grow.
1404,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Silent as in the listed ring
1405,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Two chartered wrestlers strain and cling;
1406,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Dumb as by yellow Hooghly's side
1407,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,The suffocating captives died;
1408,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,So hushed the woodland warfare goes
1409,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Unceasing; and the silent foes
1410,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Grapple and smother, strain and clasp"
1411,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Without a cry, without a gasp."
1412,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Here also sound thy fans, O God,"
1413,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Here too thy banners move abroad:
1414,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Forest and city, sea and shore,"
1415,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"And the whole earth, thy threshing-floor!"
1416,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"The drums of war, the drums of peace,"
1417,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Roll through our cities without cease,"
1418,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,And all the iron halls of life
1419,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Ring with the unremitting strife.
1420,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,
1421,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,The common lot we scarce perceive.
1422,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Crowds perish, we nor mark nor grieve:"
1423,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,The bugle calls--we mourn a few!
1424,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,What corporal's guard at Waterloo?
1425,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,What scanty hundreds more or less
1426,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,In the man-devouring Wilderness?
1427,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,What handful bled on Delhi ridge?
1428,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"--See, rather, London, on thy bridge"
1429,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"The pale battalions trample by,"
1430,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Resolved to slay, resigned to die."
1431,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Count, rather, all the maimed and dead"
1432,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,In the unbrotherly war of bread.
1433,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"See, rather, under sultrier skies"
1434,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"What vegetable Londons rise,"
1435,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"And teem, and suffer without sound:"
1436,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Or in your tranquil garden ground,"
1437,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Contented, in the falling gloom,"
1438,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Saunter and see the roses bloom.
1439,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"That these might live, what thousands died!"
1440,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,All day the cruel hoe was plied;
1441,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,The ambulance barrow rolled all day;
1442,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Your wife, the tender, kind, and gay,"
1443,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Donned her long gauntlets, caught the spud,"
1444,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,And bathed in vegetable blood;
1445,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"And the long massacre now at end,"
1446,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"See! where the lazy coils ascend,"
1447,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"See, where the bonfire sputters red"
1448,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"At even, for the innocent dead."
1449,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,
1450,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Why prate of peace? when, warriors all,"
1451,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"We clank in harness into hall,"
1452,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,And ever bare upon the board
1453,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Lies the necessary sword.
1454,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"In the green field or quiet street,"
1455,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Besieged we sleep, beleaguered eat;"
1456,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Labour by day and wake o' nights,"
1457,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,In war with rival appetites.
1458,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,The rose on roses feeds; the lark
1459,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,On larks.  The sedentary clerk
1460,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,All morning with a diligent pen
1461,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Murders the babes of other men;
1462,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"And like the beasts of wood and park,"
1463,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Protects his whelps, defends his den."
1464,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,
1465,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Unshamed the narrow aim I hold;
1466,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"I feed my sheep, patrol my fold;"
1467,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Breathe war on wolves and rival flocks,"
1468,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,A pious outlaw on the rocks
1469,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Of God and morning; and when time
1470,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Shall bow, or rivals break me, climb"
1471,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"Where no undubbed civilian dares,"
1472,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,"In my war harness, the loud stairs"
1473,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Of honour; and my conqueror
1474,XXXVIII--THE WOODMAN,Hail me a warrior fallen in war.
