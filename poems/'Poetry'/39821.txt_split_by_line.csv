145,I.,
146,I.,Outside the village a man stood alone in the moonless night. Yet it
147,I.,was not dark; for in the unending depths of violet blue the stars hung
148,I.,"many-hued and many-sized--each in their order, so clear, so bright,"
149,I.,"that the simile ""as one star differeth from another in glory"" stood"
150,I.,"out in all its vivid truth, undimmed by the mists of a Western"
151,I.,atmosphere.
152,I.,
153,I.,"The man, however, neither looked nor thought of the stars. He had seen"
154,I.,them shine thus after the winter rains ever since he had been able to
155,I.,"see, and his eyes were full of the shadowy stretch of level fields"
156,I.,"which seemed to rise towards the pale horizon. There was a fresh, damp"
157,I.,"smell in the air, and close to his feet some lighter shadows"
158,I.,surrounded by darker ones showed that the recent rains had been heavy
159,I.,enough to leave fresh pools of water in the hollows whence the village
160,I.,"had been dug--hollows like the skeleton at the feast, serving to"
161,I.,"remind the inhabitants that their origin was dust, their end the"
162,I.,grave.
163,I.,
164,I.,Toil and moil flung their refuse into these as if in derision; the
165,I.,pitiless eastern rain washed the mud from wall and roof back to its
166,I.,birthplace; but year after year the antlike builders piled more mud
167,I.,"over the ruins of the old, until the village, girt by its grave, grew"
168,I.,"dignified by age, and, gaining renewal from its own mortality, rose"
169,I.,higher and higher above the surrounding plain.
170,I.,
171,I.,"Such a treeless, formless plain, circled round by that fillet of paler"
172,I.,"sky where the stars shone dimly, like distant fire-flies. Not a"
173,I.,"landmark anywhere, save, behind the man, his own village. By day an"
174,I.,"ant-hill of low huts; in the soft darkness piled like a fort,"
175,I.,"lightless, soundless. He turned towards it, his eyes seeking a central"
176,I.,block standing higher than the rest. It was his house; the house where
177,I.,he and his forebears for many a generation had been born; where he had
178,I.,stood by his father's death-bed and taken the reins of office from the
179,I.,"dying hands; where he, too, hoped to die and pass the headship of the"
180,I.,village to some stalwart son. And it was childless as yet. A curious
181,I.,thrill seemed to join heart and hand and brain in a trinity of skill
182,I.,"and strength and love, for yonder in that dim house a woman was"
183,I.,bringing a child into the world with pains beyond the primal curse;
184,I.,"and he, the father, driven by a restlessness new to him, had wandered"
185,I.,out into the night to seek patience in action. It could not be over
186,I.,"yet; his mother had said it would be long, and the jackals had not yet"
187,I.,given their second cry. He turned again to the fields.
188,I.,
189,I.,"""The land is good,"" he murmured to himself, ""the crop is good, and the"
190,I.,"rain is good. If only this be a son--"""
191,I.,
192,I.,He drew a long breath that was half a sigh. A stir in the thorn
193,I.,enclosures where the cattle were folded for the night caught his
194,I.,"practised ear, and he walked towards them, listening. A feeble bleat"
195,I.,followed by a patter of feet made him push aside the rude hurdle
196,I.,barring the entrance. Among the crowding sheep and goats the first
197,I.,"lamb of the season lay beside its mother, and his eyes lit up as he"
198,I.,forced his way through the circle of uncertain elders to reach it. He
199,I.,"was in luck to be there, else the first-fruits would have been dead by"
200,I.,"morning. He lifted the lamb gently, thinking the while that he must"
201,I.,"divide the flock ere another night, and so run no more risks. As he"
202,I.,made his way back to the village with swinging strides the mother
203,I.,"trotted after him, bleating, and the village dogs snuffed at his heels"
204,I.,"silently; they knew better than to bark at Gunesh Chund the head-man,"
205,I.,tall and strong; looking all the taller by reason of his white
206,I.,turban and the lank folds of white drapery falling from his high
207,I.,"shoulders--so tall, that he had to stoop in order to enter the door"
208,I.,leading to the outer court of his house. Within were lights and a
209,I.,"cackle of women's voices; but here, in the wide expanse of beaten mud"
210,I.,"floor, darkness and silence, save for the cud-chewing of the milch"
211,I.,"kine ranged in one corner, and the rasping rub of a weighted halter"
212,I.,"through its ring, as the head-man's pony turned at its master's"
213,I.,entrance.
214,I.,
215,I.,"Gunesh stood still and called, ""Mother! mother!"""
216,I.,
217,I.,An old woman with an oil cresset held above her head came to the inner
218,I.,doorway and peered into the darkness through the flowers and branches
219,I.,garlanding the entrance. Then she set aside the swinging sickle hung
220,I.,"to bar all passage to evil spirits, and, stepping out, shook her head"
221,I.,at the mute inquiry in her son's eyes.
222,I.,
223,I.,"""Not yet, O Gunesh. But all goes well. 'Twill come with the dawn, like"
224,I.,"many another. And fear not, O my child. 'Tis a son. The stars and the"
225,I.,"omens are agreed."""
226,I.,
227,I.,"A faint bleat made her set the cresset nearer. ""What hast thou there,"
228,I.,"O Gunesh?"""
229,I.,
230,I.,"""The firstling, mother. 'Twas in the fold. I have brought it hither"
231,I.,"for safety."""
232,I.,
233,I.,The old woman's face shone with delight.
234,I.,
235,I.,"""A ewe lamb! 'Tis another omen; and there is luck in the house"
236,I.,to-night; for as the ewe lamb to the fold so is the male child to the
237,I.,"hearth. Have no fear, O Gunesh! Have no fear!"""
238,I.,
239,I.,"She laid one wrinkled hand on her son's arm, and, with the lamp held"
240,I.,"high in the other, gazed fondly on his face, curiously like her"
241,I.,"own--the same refined, aquiline features and narrow forehead; but the"
242,I.,"man's was less alert than the woman's, and softer, especially now as"
243,I.,he stood hesitating.
244,I.,
245,I.,"""And--and--Veru?"" he asked, somewhat sheepishly."
246,I.,
247,I.,"His mother shrugged her shoulders. ""Oh, Veru! She is well enough. She"
248,I.,"suffers, but that is the woman's part. 'Twould have been better for"
249,I.,"her years ago. But she will forget. All women do, and the omens are"
250,I.,"good--"""
251,I.,
252,I.,"A querulous complaint from within, followed by women's voices, made"
253,I.,her pause.
254,I.,
255,I.,"""I must return. Folk are so ignorant nowadays, I wonder aught comes"
256,I.,"right. But thou needst not fear, my son; the old mother knows it all."
257,I.,"So! the lamps are lit, the flowers strewn, the spices burned, the"
258,I.,chants raised duly. The Great Ones must needs be pleased; and look
259,I.,"you, Guneshwa! the sun comes back with the dawn."""
260,I.,
261,I.,"""Yea, mother,"" he answered, meekly, ""and sure the firstling shows"
262,I.,"luck."""
263,I.,
264,I.,"When she left him he threw some straw in one corner for the ewe, and"
265,I.,"guided the tottering lamb towards it, smiling to himself over the"
266,I.,"frail, ridiculous attempts at escape made by the little creature. The"
267,I.,"bleats subsided into contented silence, and he groped a stumbling way"
268,I.,"up the narrow steps leading to the flat, square roof of his house."
269,I.,"There he sat down, his back against the parapet wall which gave"
270,I.,"seclusion to the women's court below, whence a glimmer of light and a"
271,I.,murmur of voices reached eyes and ears. The rest was darkness and
272,I.,silence.
273,I.,
274,I.,"""With the dawn,"" he muttered--""it will come with the dawn."""
275,I.,
276,I.,"He took a nugget of opium from an inner pocket, broke off a bit, and"
277,I.,having swallowed it set himself deliberately towards patience. Most
278,I.,"men of his race would have found the situation simple, and their"
279,I.,"minds, if on the rack of expectation, would have been free from doubt."
280,I.,"Gunesh Chund's heart, however, was softer than most men's--softer than"
281,I.,"his mother, for instance, deemed a true man's should be. It was"
282,I.,"occupied with one thought. Supposing it was a girl, after all? What"
283,I.,should he do? He could not feel orthodox disgust or anger at the idea.
284,I.,"Yet he longed for a son, if only because it would settle so many vexed"
285,I.,questions and make life so much easier. Even now with his mother and
286,I.,Veru peace was not always to be had; but how would it be if the second
287,I.,wife with whom the former threatened him came to make a third in the
288,I.,"quarrel? Sooner or later he would have to make a fourth, of course;"
289,I.,"that was always the end, and he had all a kindly man's hatred of tears"
290,I.,and fuss.
291,I.,
292,I.,"Yet a son he must have, and that quickly, for, as his mother said,"
293,I.,truly the cousin's young wife was becoming unbearably pretentious over
294,I.,those big boys of hers. What wonder? Were they not what all boys
295,I.,should be? Gunesh Chund felt himself mean and spiritless as he
296,I.,recognized his own admiration for those whom his mother regarded as
297,I.,"mere pretenders to the hereditary office of head-man. Did not Kishnu,"
298,I.,"their black-browed, sonsy mother, openly declare that, even if Gunesh"
299,I.,"had a son, hers might yet be preferred as being older, should autumn"
300,I.,chills and summer pestilence carry the present incumbent off before
301,I.,his time? At least so the old mother said. And one thing was certain:
302,I.,"Devi Ditta and Pooram Lal, the village elders, were no friends of his"
303,I.,since that dispute about the common lands. They might side with the
304,I.,other branch. Without doubt a son must be had to carry on work in this
305,I.,world and give life to the next.
306,I.,
307,I.,And if this was a girl? A bleat from the lamb below made him suddenly
308,I.,smile at the very idea of baby fingers playing with his beard and baby
309,I.,"kisses on his face. Were girls' kisses less sweet, girls' fingers less"
310,I.,soft?
311,I.,
312,I.,"He shifted uneasily, conscious that his thoughts were heresy in his"
313,I.,"mother's eyes. Doubtless she was right. He would have to marry again,"
314,I.,"since Veru would plainly be accursed, unable, even after all the"
315,I.,"pilgrimages and vows, to perform her first duty. As he sat trying to"
316,I.,"harden his heart, wild, skirling chants rose every now and again from"
317,I.,"the women's court, and at each outburst he shifted again uneasily; for"
318,I.,"through the noise he seemed to hear the cry it was meant to deaden,"
319,I.,lest a complaint might anger the Dread Givers of Pain and Pleasure.
320,I.,And Veru had been good to him. He sat on till the dream-compeller made
321,I.,"even his hazy thought more hazy, and patience came with sleep."
322,I.,
323,I.,"When he awoke the dawn was past, and as he stretched his long length"
324,I.,"skyward in the first enjoyment of past sleep, the whole circle of"
325,I.,earth and heaven round him was ablaze with the sun rising gloriously
326,I.,"over the cloudless world. He stood so, for a moment, the centre of his"
327,I.,"universe, contented, serene, ere memory returned to him. Then he made"
328,I.,his way down to the yard with fear at his heart. All was still as the
329,I.,"grave, even in the women's court, and it was a relief when he peered"
330,I.,past the swinging sickle to see his mother wrapped in her quilt dozing
331,I.,by the open fire-place in one corner.
332,I.,
333,I.,He went over to her and touched her on the arm.
334,I.,
335,I.,"""Mother!"" he called."
336,I.,
337,I.,"She was alert in an instant, and looking in his face answered his mute"
338,I.,question fiercely.
339,I.,
340,I.,"""It is a girl--a useless girl! What need to wake thee for such bitter"
341,I.,"news? The woman is accursed."""
342,I.,
343,I.,The quick assent rising to his lips was stilled by a little cry from
344,I.,within the quilt. Something--he knew not what it was--thrilled him and
345,I.,kept him silent.
346,I.,
347,I.,"""Is--is it pretty, mother?"" he asked, sheepishly, after a while."
348,I.,
349,I.,The old lady eyed him with suspicious scorn.
350,I.,
351,I.,"""See for thyself, ninny,"" she replied, shortly."
352,I.,
353,I.,Gunesh Chund felt a distinct disappointment as he looked down at his
354,I.,first-born. He had forgotten what new-born babies were like since the
355,I.,"days when, as a boy, he was admitted to such sights. This one struck"
356,I.,"him as ugly, or at least as less pleasing than a lamb or a calf."
357,I.,
358,I.,"""God send it be not ill-looking, mother!"" he blurted out in a tone of"
359,I.,alarm.
360,I.,
361,I.,"She laughed, still in the same short and scornful fashion."
362,I.,
363,I.,"""Lo! there never was a plain woman among us. The child is well enough,"
364,I.,"and favours thee. Is it not enough that it should be a girl?"""
365,I.,
366,I.,He did not hear the latter sentence. Accustomed in all things to
367,I.,"accept his mother's fiat, he was lost in trying to trace the likeness"
368,I.,"to himself, and, to aid his efforts, drew a reflective forefinger over"
369,I.,"the featureless face, feeling, as he did so, that strange thrill at"
370,I.,"his heart again. Suddenly, as he neared the mouth, the lips trembled"
371,I.,and a little red tongue shot swiftly on his finger-tip. He burst into
372,I.,a great roar of delighted laughter.
373,I.,
374,I.,"""Ho! ho! Look, mother, look!"""
375,I.,
376,I.,"""Didst never see a child suck before, O Gunesh Chund, _lumberdar?_""[1]"
377,I.,"retorted the old woman, crossly, as she tucked the baby away again. He"
378,I.,"felt abashed, but the laughter had left him at peace with all mankind."

386,I.,
387,I.,
388,I.,"""And Veru? How is she?"""
389,I.,
390,I.,This was too much. The stern old lady rose to her full height and
391,I.,"faced him. Her grey hair, disordered by the night's watching, escaped"
392,I.,"from the close folds of her veil, and the quilt slipping from her"
393,I.,"showed her tall, erect as a girl. She threw out her right hand in"
394,I.,declamation:
395,I.,
396,I.,"""Thou art no better than a woman thyself, O Gunesh! To ask after Veru,"
397,I.,the wife of disgrace! Thou shouldst not have thought of her. Were it
398,I.,not better she were dead? Ungrateful! wicked! For she must be wicked
399,I.,"to frustrate my prayers and alms. Lo, have I not fulfilled her every"
400,I.,"wish these nine months past? And now 'tis 'How is Veru?' forsooth, and"
401,I.,no thought of the mother who has slaved in vain. But this is an end.
402,I.,"She is accursed, and thou must bring a new wife to the hearth if thou"
403,I.,"wouldst not lose thine own soul, and the soul of those who begat thee."
404,I.,"Leave Veru her girl, and be kind to her, if thou art a ninny. There"
405,I.,"are other women in the world who can bear sons."""
406,I.,
407,I.,"As Gunesh crept out of the house feeling small, despite his great"
408,I.,"height, he told himself it was only what he had expected. For all"
409,I.,"that, his mother might have waited a day or two ere speaking of the"
410,I.,"new wife, within Veru's hearing also. God send she had been asleep"
411,I.,after her long suffering!
412,I.,
413,I.,He was so dispirited that he did not care to face the _dharmsala_ with
414,I.,"its congregation of elders ready to condole, and its younger men"
415,I.,"inclined to sneer. So he gave up his morning pipe, and carried the"
416,I.,firstling to take possession of the lambing fold. As he walked along
417,I.,"in the sunshine, as he had walked in the shadow, with it in his arms,"
418,I.,"he felt its little tongue sucking at his hand, and it seemed to hurt"
419,I.,"him, body and soul."
420,I.,
421,I.,
422,I.,
423,II.,II.
424,II.,
425,II.,"The forty days of seclusion being over, Veru, in her finest clothes,"
426,II.,sat cross-legged on a string bed ready to receive company. The
427,II.,"court-yard had been freshly swept, the brass cooking-vessels scoured"
428,II.,"and set in a row against the mud wall, where the sun smote them"
429,II.,"into retaliating rays. A few flat baskets of sweets, covered with"
430,II.,penny-halfpenny Manchester pocket-handkerchiefs printed in the
431,II.,"semblance of a pack of cards, stood ready for the expected guests, and"
432,II.,Gunesh Chund's mother had been busy all the morning making a sort of
433,II.,"furmenty in honour of the occasion; for, though she considered her"
434,II.,"labour thrown away on the birth of a girl, she would not for the world"
435,II.,"have omitted a single ceremony, and so have given colour to outside"
436,II.,"condolence. Veru herself was a delicate-looking, pretty woman of about"
437,II.,"six-and-twenty, with a broad forehead, and a thin-lipped, sensitive"
438,II.,mouth--both of which characteristics were more blemishes than beauties
439,II.,"in the opinion of her neighbours. Her chief defect, however, in the"
440,II.,"eyes of the stalwart, open-hearted, shrill-voiced, village women lay"
441,II.,"in a certain refined reserve, which they set down to conceit born of"
442,II.,her pretensions to scholarship--though how any woman could be so
443,II.,wrong-minded as to usurp man's estate by learning to read and write
444,II.,"passed their simple understanding. But Veru, who had lived with a rich"
445,II.,"uncle during her girlhood, had shared her cousin's desultory visits to"
446,II.,"a mission school for a year or two, and returned to her parents and"
447,II.,"marriage with a book in which she could read glibly, and a reputation"
448,II.,for writing. She could also knit many-hued comforters in _brioche_
449,II.,"stitch, and darn strips of net in divers patterns--appalling and"
450,II.,"almost incredible culture, viewed with disfavour by all save Gunesh,"
451,II.,who was simple enough to admire it; probably because _she_ was woman
452,II.,enough to admire him immensely.
453,II.,
454,II.,"The infant, to whom the name of Nihâli had been given, lay in her"
455,II.,"arms, bedizened into the semblance of a performing monkey; tight"
456,II.,"little silk trousers on the bandy legs, a tinsel-decorated muslin"
457,II.,"bodice, and a flowing veil, the size of a pocket-handkerchief,"
458,II.,disposed over the round skull-cap where a black fringe of wool
459,II.,"simulated hair. On this outfit Veru had spent much time and trouble,"
460,II.,"while her mother-in-law grumbled under her breath at the expense, or"
461,II.,openly said that in her day a decent woman would have thought it shame
462,II.,"to make such a fuss over a girl, after keeping her master waiting ten"
463,II.,long years for a child.
464,II.,
465,II.,"There was bitter war between these two women outwardly: yet, however"
466,II.,"fiercely Veru combated the elder woman's views, in her heart of hearts"
467,II.,she could not overcome the inherited conviction that the meanest thing
468,II.,"on God's earth, was a sonless wife. Cultured retorts as to what she"
469,II.,"had heard and read in school of Western opinions, and of the sex of"
470,II.,"the Queen-Empress, did very well as lethal weapons, but as inward balm"
471,II.,"were most unsatisfactory. Often and often, after a passage of arms in"
472,II.,which her more dexterous point had reduced her adversary to the usual
473,II.,"appeal for patience, she would creep away into one of the dark,"
474,II.,"windowless rooms opening off the central court-yard, on pretence that"
475,II.,"the light prevented her baby from sleeping. There, safe from"
476,II.,"observation, she would weep salt tears over its unconscious face."
477,II.,"After all her prayers and alms, why had not Fate given her a son? How"
478,II.,"much easier it would have been for everybody, Fate included; for now"
479,II.,high Heaven would have to be wearied once more!
480,II.,
481,II.,"She had seen but little of her husband during her days of seclusion,"
482,II.,so the task of shutting her white teeth over a retort when he
483,II.,was by had not been a very difficult one. But now the every-day
484,II.,"life was beginning again, and it would be harder to keep up the"
485,II.,forbearance--though she was clever enough to see that it earned his
486,II.,gratitude.
487,II.,
488,II.,He came in before going to his afternoon's work in the fields to
489,II.,inspect the preparations. The sight of the bedizened baby awoke his
490,II.,broad laugh.
491,II.,
492,II.,"""Ho! ho! ho! Grandmother, see what a figure Veru hath made of the"
493,II.,child! For sure it is like the puppets Dya Ram brought round at Diwâli
494,II.,"Fair, that danced on a string!"""
495,II.,
496,II.,"""I'm glad thy wits give thee sense to see the folly of dressing the"
497,II.,"child so,"" grumbled the old woman. ""In my day there were none of those"
498,II.,"fal-lals on farmers' children. We left them to the silly town's-folk."""
499,II.,
500,II.,"""In your day, mother, farmers' wives did not know how to make them;"
501,II.,"but I cut and sewed them all,"" retorted Veru, with studious courtesy."
502,II.,
503,II.,"""Aye, aye, that's true,"" remarked her husband, relieved. ""Thou hast"
504,II.,"clever fingers despite they are so small.--Hath she not, mother?"""
505,II.,
506,II.,"""Clever, mayhap; but in my time wives found better work than snipping"
507,II.,"and sewing. They made stalwart sons for the hearth, and left clothes"
508,II.,"to the tailor. 'Tis the other way on now, I suppose. Thou wilt send to"
509,II.,"the tailor for a son soon, I suppose. It is time."""
510,II.,
511,II.,"""Nay, but the mother is right,"" interrupted Gunesh Chund, hastily,"
512,II.,"seeing Veru's eyes begin to flash; ""the little one is like a puppet,"
513,II.,"as I said, Veru, and 'tis happier with its arms and legs free. I love"
514,II.,to watch it struggling on its back like a young duck with the megrims.
515,II.,"'Tis comical. But feed it well, wife; if 'twere a calf I would hold it"
516,II.,"over-thin. Young things need fat. Do as the mother bids thee, and 'tis"
517,II.,"sure to thrive. Had she not daughters of her own in her time?"" His"
518,II.,voice had a ring of appeal in it.
519,II.,
520,II.,"""Aye, and some of them in man's guise,"" muttered the old lady as she"
521,II.,"watched him bending over the baby. Nevertheless, she spoke more softly"
522,II.,"as she bade him get to his fields, the proper place for a man."
523,II.,
524,II.,"""True, mother, true,"" he assented happily, as he went to the door"
525,II.,"with her. ""And there is no place I like so well. 'Tis good to stand"
526,II.,"knee-deep in young corn when it grows blue-green, as this year. Thou"
527,II.,shouldst see it in the dip by the sandy bottom. And see the dappled
528,II.,"sky like a partridge breast, auguring more rain. A good harvest,"
529,II.,"mother! A good harvest and new dresses--"""
530,II.,
531,II.,"She checked him. ""Nay, Gunesh, there is the new wife to think of"
532,II.,"first. Good harvest days are good wedding days."""
533,II.,
534,II.,"They were beyond ear-shot, and yet the man gave a quick glance at the"
535,II.,woman within.
536,II.,
537,II.,"""Hush, mother, hush!"" he said, almost in a whisper. ""Should a man take"
538,II.,"the name of another woman in his mouth, with the cry of a month-old"
539,II.,"babe in his ear? There is time yet."""
540,II.,
541,II.,"""Time!"" she echoed. ""Time, indeed! 'Tis not time, but will, is"
542,II.,wanting. Get thee gone to thy fields--thank Heaven thou art not a
543,II.,"ninny there--for see, yonder comes Kishnu to the reception, bringing"
544,II.,"all her three. The jade! 'Tis only to crow over our girl!"""
545,II.,
546,II.,"Gunesh tried to frown as he stood irresolute, but his mild face"
547,II.,refused the task.
548,II.,
549,II.,"""May be, mother,"" he replied simply, ""yet were the boys mine I would"
550,II.,"take them wherever I went, crow or no crow. They are so sweet."""
551,II.,
552,II.,"His mother stamped her foot. ""Aye, aye! Sweet for sure. And will not"
553,II.,the eldest make a fine _lumberdar?_ Folk might almost deem him thy
554,II.,"son."""
555,II.,
556,II.,"""I could wish none better."""
557,II.,
558,II.,"Foiled by his gentleness, she watched his tall figure go down the"
559,II.,"alley for a minute, and then began the attack in a more promising"
560,II.,quarter.
561,II.,
562,II.,"""Here comes Kishnu, Veru. Did I not say she would be the first? The"
563,II.,"crowing cock loves early hours. She hath her three with her, and"
564,II.,"Gunesh, poor soul, must needs stop and fondle them. He loves those"
565,II.,"boys; and who can blame him? Sure, a man's heart cannot live in his"
566,II.,"breast always!"""
567,II.,
568,II.,"""That is true; but when a man gives it to a wife she can keep it from"
569,II.,"straying,"" retorted Veru. She was never without words, but they were"
570,II.,"empty diet, and she could not help looking at Kishnu's boys with"
571,II.,hungry eyes.
572,II.,
573,II.,"""I scarce liked to bring Shivu here to-day,"" quoth the latter,"
574,II.,settling herself with a flounce among the voluminous skirts that hung
575,II.,"half-way down her trousered legs. ""You see, he grows so big--almost"
576,II.,"too much of a man for these women's doings."""
577,II.,
578,II.,"She tittered, twisted her huge nose-ring to one side, disposed her"
579,II.,"youngest at her capacious bosom, and, thus prepared for conversation,"
580,II.,"began afresh in a shrill, strident voice:"
581,II.,
582,II.,"""So that's your girl, Veru! Sure you have dressed it for the wedding"
583,II.,already! Early days; but with a daughter one has to think betimes.--Is
584,II.,"it not so, grandmother?"""
585,II.,
586,II.,"""Our women have no difficulty in finding husbands,"" replied Veru's"
587,II.,"mother-in-law, who, whatever she might say herself, was not inclined"
588,II.,"to stand impertinence from outsiders. ""But perhaps in thy family 'tis"
589,II.,"a different story."""
590,II.,
591,II.,"Now Kishnu was no beauty, despite her fruitfulness. Neither was she"
592,II.,"ready of tongue. So she sniffed, comforting herself with the knowledge"
593,II.,"that words, after all, were but poor weapons against facts. As an"
594,II.,"immediate revenge, however, she dragged the most disagreeable topic"
595,II.,she could think of into the conversation.
596,II.,
597,II.,"""Guneshwa looked but ill at ease, it struck me. No doubt the new"
598,II.,"settlement in the village gives him trouble."""
599,II.,
600,II.,"""What new settlement?"" asked Veru, sharply."
601,II.,
602,II.,"Settlement time meant war time, since in the compiling of new records"
603,II.,lay ample opportunity for spite; and her husband as head-man had
604,II.,enemies.
605,II.,
606,II.,Kishnu tittered again. This was better than she had expected.
607,II.,
608,II.,"""So! I have broken the seal of a secret. Mayhap Gunesh said nothing"
609,II.,lest it should worry thee during the time of recovery. But 'tis so. My
610,II.,"man heard it awhile ago through his friends at court; for certain,"
611,II.,"yesterday. Sure, Veru, 'tis a thousand pities this is a girl. Gunesh"
612,II.,could have written a son's name as his heir in the new papers; and
613,II.,"that would have ended dispute forever."""
614,II.,
615,II.,"The _lumberdar's_ women folk looked at each other, for once in accord."
616,II.,"Gunesh had hidden this thing from them, and they were too proud to"
617,II.,"show how it had moved them. They preferred letting the shaft rankle,"
618,II.,"perhaps needlessly, rather than inquire further of Kishnu."
619,II.,
620,II.,"""'Tis no pity at all,"" retorted Veru, tossing her head. ""There can be"
621,II.,"no dispute that I know of. And I prefer girls."""
622,II.,
623,II.,This went too far for her mother-in-law. At the risk of Kishnu's
624,II.,"delectation, she lost patience."
625,II.,
626,II.,"""There 'tis! Heard one ever the like? '_I prefer girls_.' So! thus"
627,II.,"thou mockest the great ones, and by idle words turn my prayers to"
628,II.,"naught. 'Tis too vexatious--"""
629,II.,
630,II.,"""Girls are every whit as good as boys. The great Queen--"""
631,II.,
632,II.,"""Pshaw! I am sick of the great Queen! Why did she come to breed"
633,II.,"dissension, and teach young women to mock at the old? Though, for"
634,II.,"sure, she herself knows better, seeing she hath proved her worth by a"
635,II.,"good family of sons."""
636,II.,
637,II.,"""So may Nihâli in her time."""
638,II.,
639,II.,"""What! That sickly thing! Thou wilt scarce rear her to the first year,"
640,II.,"and mayhap 'tis better so. 'Dead girls,' thou knowest, 'bring live"
641,II.,"boys.'"""
642,II.,
643,II.,Veru's face of fear sent a pang of remorse to a heart which beat true
644,II.,"after its fashion, and the old lady went on, hastily:"
645,II.,
646,II.,"""Nay, daughter-in-law! Perchance I am wrong. The child dwindles a bit,"
647,II.,no more. I will make seven spices for it. 'Twill thrive if only thou
648,II.,"wilt be reasonable, and save thyself from tantrums and tears. 'Tis the"
649,II.,"calf has the pain, mind you, if the cow steals green wheat."""
650,II.,
651,II.,"""And with a girl the mind is at rest,"" continued Kishnu, in malicious"
652,II.,"consolation. ""Now, with me, if the charcoal rubs from their foreheads"
653,II.,"I'm agog with fear of the evil eye, and the rest of my day is wasted"
654,II.,"in prayers and offerings. As thou sayst, Veru, girls are better."""
655,II.,
656,II.,"Veru had no answer ready; and even when the stream of visitors set in,"
657,II.,"full of chattering congratulations and condolences, she did not find"
658,II.,"her tongue. The noise, she said, made her head ache and disturbed the"
659,II.,"baby. She stripped the finery from its little limbs, and, wrapping it"
660,II.,"warmly in her veil, held it tight to her breast, refusing to uncover"
661,II.,it in order to gratify the curious.
662,II.,
663,II.,"Gunesh, coming in from the darkening fields, with their calm in his"
664,II.,"face, found her crying in the inner room."
665,II.,
666,II.,"""She wants to bring another wife home even now. She will not have"
667,II.,"patience and wait awhile."" That was the burden of her complaint, while"
668,II.,Gunesh sat comforting her uneasily.
669,II.,
670,II.,"""Surely, Veru, I have waited,"" he said, after a time. ""Few would have"
671,II.,been so patient; but thou art a good wife and duteous even with the
672,II.,"mother."""
673,II.,
674,II.,"""And thou! Oh, thou art good, Gunesh--so good to me! See, thy patience"
675,II.,"hath brought Nihâli. Wait a year, only a year longer, husband, and it"
676,II.,"will bring thee a son."""
677,II.,
678,II.,He looked at the mother and child with kindling eyes.
679,II.,
680,II.,"""A year! Surely, surely! That is but fair. So dry thine eyes, wife,"
681,II.,"for I am hungry."""
682,II.,
683,II.,"That night, when Veru had retired to her bed with the baby, and he sat"
684,II.,"smoking with his mother in the outer yard, he asked her wistfully if"
685,II.,she really thought the child was dwindling.
686,II.,
687,II.,"She turned on him fiercely, perhaps from a feeling of pity."
688,II.,
689,II.,"""And if it does, canst not trust me to physic it? Or wouldst thou have"
690,II.,a man doctor to thy women's rooms? They tell me the travelling one
691,II.,sent on his rounds by the _Sirkar_[2] is in the next village but now.
692,II.,"Shall I bid him come, since thou seemst to hold by new-fangled ways?"""

700,II.,
701,II.,
702,II.,"Gunesh Chund filled his pipe again with poppy-leaves and tobacco, and"
703,II.,watched his mother carding cotton viciously. What would she say if she
704,II.,knew of the promise he had made to Veru? The narcotic did not soothe
705,II.,"him; and when sleep failed, he strolled out to where the village"
706,II.,elders sat discussing the possible effects of this new settlement on
707,II.,the total of revenue due from the community. The familiar company was
708,II.,"a relief, though it brought a doubt of his own wisdom in waiting a"
709,II.,"year. Still it was only a year. After that, if Veru failed to bear him"
710,II.,"a son, his duty to himself, to his ancestors, and to the _Sirkar_"
711,II.,demanded another wife.
712,II.,
713,II.,
714,II.,
715,III.,III.
716,III.,
717,III.,"Whether Gunesh Chund's mother, when she prophesied evil to little"
718,III.,"Nihâli, did so from conviction or temper, it was not long before her"
719,III.,"words came true. Despite the marvellous seven spices, and many another"
720,III.,"time-honoured remedy, the baby dwindled and pined unaccountably. Then"
721,III.,"came a day when Veru, half distraught and absolutely helpless, sat"
722,III.,"with it in her arms, sullen and silent. The old women of the village"
723,III.,"dropped in one after the other, more from curiosity than sympathy,"
724,III.,"each laying down the law as to some infallible nostrum, whose efficacy"
725,III.,they defended against other views in high-pitched cackle. At last
726,III.,"Veru, whose smattering of knowledge only brought incredulity without"
727,III.,"lending aid, declaring she would not have the child tormented further,"
728,III.,"laid it to her breast, and turned her back upon hoarded wisdom. Only"
729,III.,"when Gunesh Chund came wandering in restlessly from the fieldwork,"
730,III.,"which for the first time in his life failed to bring him peace, she"
731,III.,unclasped her straining arms to show him the still face lying against
732,III.,the full breast that roused no sign of life or desire.
733,III.,
734,III.,A piteous sight. The big tears ran down his cheeks and fell on the
735,III.,"soft, closed hand. He took a corner of his cotton shawl and wiped them"
736,III.,away clumsily but with infinite tenderness.
737,III.,
738,III.,"""Sure, thou dost love her, though she is a girl,"" said Veru, with the"
739,III.,calm of despair.
740,III.,
741,III.,The man broke into a sob and turned away.
742,III.,
743,III.,"""Mother, canst thou do nothing?"" he asked, in all the wistful"
744,III.,"confidence of a child, laying his great hand on the old woman's head"
745,III.,as she bent over her task of kneading the dough for his supper.
746,III.,
747,III.,"""Do! What is to be done with a woman who cries out if the child is"
748,III.,"touched? I tell thee, O Guneshwa, the little one is bewitched--though"
749,III.,God only knows why any one should trouble to cast an eye on a girl.
750,III.,"Ask Munlya. Ask Premi, or Chuni, or any wise woman. But Veru heeds us"
751,III.,"not, saying the books deny it. So be it! The child will die!"""
752,III.,
753,III.,"Gunesh Chund lingered, hesitating."
754,III.,
755,III.,"""I--I--perhaps, mother, 'twould be better to fetch the doctor. He is"
756,III.,"here still, they say."""
757,III.,
758,III.,"His mother sprang to her feet, all the vigour and fire of her past"
759,III.,youth in eyes and gesture.
760,III.,
761,III.,"""That I should have lived to hear such words in the house where I came"
762,III.,"a modest bride, where never man set foot save thy father and mine!"
763,III.,Wilt thou cast thy honour and mine in the dust for a baby girl? Be it
764,III.,"so, Gunesh! Choose now between her and me; or choose, rather, between"
765,III.,"Veru's barren kisses and my curse, for the child will die if the evil"
766,III.,"eye be not averted by charms. Choose, I say; for, by my father's soul,"
767,III.,"if this bastard half-a-man enters the house, I leave it!"""
768,III.,
769,III.,"""Nay, mother! I did but suggest. Veru--"""
770,III.,
771,III.,"""O Veru! Veru! I am sick of the name. 'Tis she who hath bewitched"
772,III.,"thee; 'tis her evil eye--"""
773,III.,
774,III.,"He interrupted her fiercely, seizing her by the wrist."
775,III.,
776,III.,"""Peace, I say, mother! Peace! I will not hear such words."""
777,III.,
778,III.,"""They are true for all that. She _hath_ bewitched thee!"""
779,III.,
780,III.,"They stood for a moment face to face, so like each other in their"
781,III.,"anger and dread. Then the strong man quailed, and fled before her"
782,III.,"words and his own thoughts. He was no wiser than his fellows, for all"
783,III.,"the soft heart that betrayed him into progress; perhaps less so, since"
784,III.,the superstitions of his fathers enslaved his mind without controlling
785,III.,"his affections. He wandered into the fields once more, where the rows"
786,III.,of blossoming mustard sown among the wheat showed like a yellow sea
787,III.,"against the horizon, but close at hand broke the green gloom of the"
788,III.,"earing corn in long, curling waves crested with gold--a sight dear to"
789,III.,husbandmen's eyes! Yet it brought no comfort to the dull ache in
790,III.,"Gunesh's heart, which drove him to finish work with the first excuse"
791,III.,of waning light.
792,III.,
793,III.,The child was at least no worse. Perhaps the warmth had soothed its
794,III.,"pain; perhaps the feeble life was sinking silently; but the ignorant,"
795,III.,loving eyes that watched it knew not whether the stillness made for
796,III.,sleep or death.
797,III.,
798,III.,"Save for Gunesh Chund and his wife the house was empty, for his mother"
799,III.,had sought the relief of words with a neighbouring crony.
800,III.,
801,III.,"""Veru,"" said Gunesh in a whisper, as if the darkening walls had ears,"
802,III.,"""dost think the doctor might do her good? The mother will not have him"
803,III.,"here--mayhap she is right--but I could take the child to him."""
804,III.,
805,III.,"""O husband!"" Brought face to face with decision, the woman shrank from"
806,III.,"action. ""I know not, and the mother would be so angry."""
807,III.,
808,III.,"But the slower mind and warmer heart had been at work on the problem,"
809,III.,and ciphered it out once and for all.
810,III.,
811,III.,"""She need never know. Sit within, silent, as if thou hadst it still,"
812,III.,"should she return. I shall not be long; so give the child to me."""
813,III.,
814,III.,"Half fearful, half pleased at his decision, the mother shifted her"
815,III.,"burden to his awkward arms. How small, how light it seemed, hidden"
816,III.,"away in the folds of his flowing plaid-like shawl, as he passed"
817,III.,"through the twilight alleys on his way to the camping-ground where, in"
818,III.,"the mud caravanserai, the travelling vaccinator was to be found!"
819,III.,"Neighbours, resting after the day's labour, called to him in various"
820,III.,"greeting, and he paused to reply with dull patience, conscious always"
821,III.,of the unseen burden near his heart. So had he carried the firstling
822,III.,lamb on the night when Nihâli was born. How it had struggled to
823,III.,"escape, and sucked at his restraining hand in fierce desire for life!"
824,III.,A fear lest the child's quiet was death made him turn aside more than
825,III.,once into a darker corner to look and listen.
826,III.,
827,III.,Still with the same dull patience he sat down before the vacant room
828,III.,in the serai to await the vaccinator's return; for patience and
829,III.,"doggedness are the peasant farmer's unfailing inheritance, not to be"
830,III.,"reft from him by tyrants or strangers. Some camel-drivers, newly"
831,III.,"arrived, were cooking their food at a blazing wood-fire in the open,"
832,III.,"whence the flames threw long shadows, distorted out of all human"
833,III.,"semblance, into the far corners of the court-yard, where a circle of"
834,III.,kneeling camels browsed upon a pile of green branches. Familiar sights
835,III.,"and sounds to Gunesh's eyes and ears, yet to-night, with that strange"
836,III.,"burden near his heart, seeming out of place and unexpected."
837,III.,
838,III.,"Meanwhile Veru, with empty arms and nervous fingers twisting and"
839,III.,"turning themselves on each other restlessly, was straining her eyes"
840,III.,"into the darkness, and wondering with greater and greater insistence"
841,III.,what kept her husband. Her mother-in-law had not returned. She almost
842,III.,"wished she had, for the solitude and silence seemed unending. At last,"
843,III.,"unable to endure the suspense any longer, she drew her veil tightly,"
844,III.,"to avoid recognition, and stole like a shadow along the darkest side"
845,III.,"of the street to meet Gunesh. But he, also weary of waiting, returned"
846,III.,from an unsuccessful pursuit of the doctor by another route. Thus no
847,III.,"reply came to his whispered call to Veru, as he stepped over the"
848,III.,threshold. What had happened? He repeated the call louder.
849,III.,
850,III.,"""Veru!--Mother! Is there no one in the house?"""
851,III.,
852,III.,"His mother's voice answered him from behind, and he turned to her,"
853,III.,"relieved; for all its lightness, the little burden at his heart grew"
854,III.,heavy in responsibility. Even in his mother's arms it seemed safer.
855,III.,
856,III.,"Two old women who had accompanied her, with the intention of making a"
857,III.,"last appeal to common sense, looked at the child critically."
858,III.,
859,III.,"""Truly, O mother of Gunesha,"" said one, ""'tis the evil eye; but there"
860,III.,"is time yet to cast the devil out by fumigations."""
861,III.,
862,III.,"""Without doubt,"" echoed the other. ""I have seen children nearer death"
863,III.,"than this, snatched from the grave by wisdom such as thine."""
864,III.,
865,III.,"Gunesh Chund's mother looked at him, her triumph dimmed and softened"
866,III.,by appeal.
867,III.,
868,III.,"""Wilt kill the little thing by over-kindness?"" she whispered. ""See,"
869,III.,"chance hath given her to us. Veru, poor fool, is away.--Let us work"
870,III.,"the charm, Guneshwa. I worked it on thee when thou wast a sickly babe,"
871,III.,"and see how strong and tall thou art."""
872,III.,
873,III.,"He looked from one to the other doubtfully. What was he, an ignorant"
874,III.,"man, to set his wishes against these wise mothers, when they assured"
875,III.,"him of success? He gave a sign of assent, and set himself towards"
876,III.,authority should Veru come back ere the business was well over.
877,III.,
878,III.,"The old women turned to their task joyfully. The time was past, they"
879,III.,"cackled, for any but robust measures, and life in Nihâli's frail form"
880,III.,"must be made unendurable to the devil without delay. For this purpose,"
881,III.,"what more effectual than red pepper and turmeric? Swiftly, with"
882,III.,"muttered charms, and many a deft passing through of this thing seven"
883,III.,"times, and that seven times seven, the child was laid on a low,"
884,III.,"strong-seated stool, in full blaze of the fire-light, while the"
885,III.,"grandmother, bringing the drugs from her stores within, mixed them in"
886,III.,approved manner. An earthenware saucer filled with smouldering
887,III.,"charcoal served for brazier. Then, all being ready and placed beneath"
888,III.,"the stool, a discordant chant was raised, and the powder flung on the"
889,III.,embers.
890,III.,
891,III.,From the dense yellow smoke enveloping poor little Nihâli came a
892,III.,"feeble, gasping cry."
893,III.,
894,III.,"""Mother!"" pleaded the man, hiding his face."
895,III.,
896,III.,"""'Tis the devil cries,"" replied the stern old woman, flinging fresh"
897,III.,drugs on the coals.
898,III.,
899,III.,"A fainter cry came, echoed in a shriek from the door, where Veru"
900,III.,"stood, paralyzed for an instant by rage and terror. The next, dashing"
901,III.,"the witches aside with furious blows, coughing and suffocating in the"
902,III.,"fumes, her empty, craving arms sought the child and found it--too"
903,III.,"late! A sigh, a struggle, and the demon, or angel of life, had fled"
904,III.,forever.
905,III.,
906,III.,"Smarting and half blind with the foul smoke, Veru's eyes failed to see"
907,III.,the tall figure half hidden in the corner; but her voice seemed to
908,III.,pierce him through and through.
909,III.,
910,III.,"""I gave her to Guneshwa! Where is he?"""
911,III.,
912,III.,"Then, as the full extent of the result came home to her, shriek after"
913,III.,"shriek rent the air, and she fell into one of the violent hysterical"
914,III.,fits so common among Indian women of all classes.
915,III.,
916,III.,"""The devil hath entered into _her_,"" said her mother-in-law, bitterly;"
917,III.,so the turmeric and red pepper came in handy.
918,III.,
919,III.,"Gunesh Chund, torn by a vague remorse, and uncertain what to think,"
920,III.,found his refuge in the dream-compeller. But while he dreamed under
921,III.,"the stars, on the roof that rose like a watch-tower above the village,"
922,III.,"and Veru lay in the unconsciousness of exhaustion below, a strange,"
923,III.,"ghastly scene was enacted in the outer court-yard, where the old women"
924,III.,"flitted about with tiny oil lamps in their hands. Little Nihâli,"
925,III.,"dressed in her fine clothes, with bandy legs straightened and"
926,III.,"struggling arms at rest, lay stiff on the string stool, with each tiny"
927,III.,"palm clenched over a ball of raw sugar, and miniature cards of"
928,III.,"cotton-wool, such as women prepare for their spinning, between each"
929,III.,"finger. So armed with all female attractions, the sugar symbolizing"
930,III.,"sweetness to a lover, the cotton diligence as a wife, Nihâli was"
931,III.,"ready, like a true woman, to sacrifice herself unconditionally in"
932,III.,order to bring sons to the hearth.
933,III.,
934,III.,"""Veru, of course, would not hear of this,"" said the stern grandmother"
935,III.,"to her cronies, ""and Guneshwa is fairly bewitched by her obstinacy."
936,III.,"Nevertheless, the opportunity shall not slip; for if the omens are"
937,III.,"bad, I must give him another wife without delay."""
938,III.,
939,III.,"So, in the darkest of the night, before the jackal's last cry heralded"
940,III.,"the dawn, the three women slipped through the deserted streets. No"
941,III.,"fear was on their faces, no huddling together or whispering; straight"
942,III.,"in solemn order, as to a sacred duty, went the little procession,"
943,III.,"headed by the tall, gaunt grandmother, bearing the dead baby in her"
944,III.,arms.
945,III.,
946,III.,"Past the still, shining pools of water girdling the village; beyond"
947,III.,"the thorn enclosures; through the fields of wheat, till the village"
948,III.,"common-land, a stretch of bare mud and low, sparse bushes, lay dim and"
949,III.,desolate around them.
950,III.,
951,III.,"""'Tis the nick of time,"" said one of the cronies, pointing to a grey"
952,III.,"shadow slinking away from their steps; ""now may the Great One send a"
953,III.,"good omen!"""
954,III.,
955,III.,In an open spot surrounded by bushes Gunesh Chund's mother paused and
956,III.,looked around.
957,III.,
958,III.,"""Here,"" she whispered, and the others nodded."
959,III.,
960,III.,"She stooped to lay the dead child on the ground, carefully placing it"
961,III.,so that the feet were from the village; then raising herself to her
962,III.,"full height, she stretched her right hand towards the horizon, as if"
963,III.,"pointing out a road, repeating in a wild chant echoed by those behind"
964,III.,her:
965,III.,
966,III.,
967,III.,"""Thus we drive you forth, O daughter!"
968,III.,"Come not back, but send a brother."""
969,III.,
970,III.,
971,III.,"Swift and silent as they had come, they made their way back to the"
972,III.,"village, leaving the dead baby alone, unwatched. For a while the night"
973,III.,"was still; then soft pattering feet crept round Nihâli, and fierce"
974,III.,eyes glared on her from the bushes; but Death held her in his arms
975,III.,"secure, and fear was over forever."
976,III.,
977,III.,"""Hist!"" cried the retreating women, as the sobbing wail of the jackal,"
978,III.,"beginning with a faint whine, rose louder and louder, till each bush"
979,III.,and brake seemed to give a voice to swell the horrid chorus.
980,III.,
981,III.,They waited listening.
982,III.,
983,III.,"""Now may the omen be good!"" said one."
984,III.,
985,III.,"""The dawn will show,"" replied the grandmother, calmly. ""I will wait"
986,III.,"here; go you home to bed."""
987,III.,
988,III.,"But when the rising sun brought sufficient light to see withal, her"
989,III.,eager eyes could find no certain indication on which to build either
990,III.,"hope or fear. Marks there were, and plenty, showing where the beasts"
991,III.,"had fought, but no broad track of dragging, either away from or"
992,III.,"towards the village, conveying Nihâli's last message to her friends."
993,III.,
994,III.,Had she gone over the edge of the world seeking for the long-sought
995,III.,son? Or had she come back to haunt the hearth with her unwelcome
996,III.,presence? Who could tell?
997,III.,
998,III.,"""Everything goes wrong nowadays,"" muttered the discontented old woman."
999,III.,"""Even the omens fail! 'Tis all the fault of the great Queen and her"
1000,III.,"new-fangled notions."""
1001,III.,
1002,III.,
1003,III.,
1004,IV.,IV.
1005,IV.,
1006,IV.,The next three months brought Gunesh Chund many an uneasy hour. Even
1007,IV.,"when, driven to bay by his mother's entreaties to allow her to look"
1008,IV.,"for a new wife, he confessed his promise to wait a year, he gained no"
1009,IV.,"respite from her reproaches, but rather enhanced their venom by her"
1010,IV.,"contempt for his weakness. What was he, to set himself above the"
1011,IV.,"wisdom of his fathers? What was the reading-writing woman, that she"
1012,IV.,should run counter to the traditions which held the first duty of a
1013,IV.,Hindu wife was to be that of bringing a son to the hearth? He had no
1014,IV.,answer save a dull consciousness that somehow he was not quite as his
1015,IV.,"fathers. They, for instance, had calmly acquiesced in such customs as"
1016,IV.,"the exposure of the dead child to the jackals; while, despite his"
1017,IV.,"familiarity with the idea, its practice had filled him with aversion."
1018,IV.,"Honest as he was by nature, he never regretted the deceit which sent"
1019,IV.,"Veru, after she recovered from the illness following on the shock of"
1020,IV.,"Nihâli's death, to cool a little grave[3] by the burning-ground with"
1021,IV.,her tears and offerings.
1022,IV.,
1023,IV.,
1024,IV.,---------------------
1025,IV.,
1026,IV.,[Footnote 3: Female children are not worth the expense of burning.]
1027,IV.,
1028,IV.,---------------------
1029,IV.,
1030,IV.,
1031,IV.,"""'Twill only make her ill again to know what thou hast done,"" he had"
1032,IV.,"said to his mother, with a decision new to him. ""Silence will be the"
1033,IV.,"wisest for thee also, since in this I am on her side."""
1034,IV.,
1035,IV.,As for the casting out of the demon which had hurried on the
1036,IV.,"inevitable end, Veru always maintained to her mother-in-law that it"
1037,IV.,partook of the nature of murder; but with her usual shrewdness she
1038,IV.,"exonerated Gunesh Chund from blame. For this he was grateful, though"
1039,IV.,his mind was by no means made up as to the rights and wrongs of the
1040,IV.,question.
1041,IV.,
1042,IV.,From this and many another problem he took refuge in the fields. The
1043,IV.,"fierce dry winds of summer blew with scorching heat, bringing with"
1044,IV.,them the necessity for a ceaseless watering of the crops. Many and
1045,IV.,"many a silent, peaceful hour he spent in the forked seat behind the"
1046,IV.,"oxen, half asleep, half awake; while the well-wheel circled round he"
1047,IV.,"circled round the wheel, and the great world circled round beyond him."
1048,IV.,Whether it span swift or slow he knew not and he cared not.
1049,IV.,
1050,IV.,"Many an hour, too, he spent resting, smoking and talking, under the"
1051,IV.,"shade of the one big mulberry-tree, while the greybeards wheezed out"
1052,IV.,"their mouldy proverbs, and the lads listened with their mouths full of"
1053,IV.,"the overripe dead-sweet fruit. A kindly, honest crew; mayhap not far"
1054,IV.,"above the circling bullocks in mind or ambitions, but for the most"
1055,IV.,part without an ungenerous thought or unfriendly wish.
1056,IV.,
1057,IV.,"Or he would take his pipe down to the village _dharmsala_, where"
1058,IV.,strangers found a lodging and the inhabitants a debating club; but
1059,IV.,here the goad of Fate hit keenly at times when the talk fell on the
1060,IV.,"coming settlement, and Kishnu's people would condole with him in"
1061,IV.,"covert sneers. For Gunesh Chund had been accustomed, ever since his"
1062,IV.,"father died, to have the first and last word in that assembly of"
1063,IV.,"elders, and even his gentle self-depreciation could not fail to feel a"
1064,IV.,"certain loss of authority. One night, after Kishnu's husband, his own"
1065,IV.,"cousin, backed by some friends, had openly derided his opinion, and"
1066,IV.,"talked big about changes in the future, Gunesh sat on longer than was"
1067,IV.,"his wont among the elder men. They had been his father's friends, and"
1068,IV.,"he turned to them instinctively for support. Yet as they sat, solemnly"
1069,IV.,crouched up on the high wooden bench which filled the rudely carved
1070,IV.,"veranda from end to end, no voice came from the darkness where they"
1071,IV.,"showed grey and shadowy in their white drapery; almost formless, save"
1072,IV.,when every now and again a more vigorous pull at a pipe fanned the
1073,IV.,"embers in it to a glow, which lit up the lean, high-featured faces and"
1074,IV.,wrinkled hands.
1075,IV.,
1076,IV.,"And Gunesh, too, remained silent and perturbed, knowing well what was"
1077,IV.,in their thoughts. It was a relief when the hubble-bubble of the pipes
1078,IV.,dropped into insignificance before a speech summoned up by neighbourly
1079,IV.,"nods and nudges. It came from the patriarch, whose palsied hand shook"
1080,IV.,as he stretched it forward.
1081,IV.,
1082,IV.,"""Listen, O Guneshwa, the _lumberdar_. Thy grandfather and I played"
1083,IV.,together as boys in the house of my father and his. But his father was
1084,IV.,"the _lumberdar_, and mine but an elder. If the seed of strife springs"
1085,IV.,"in the village, whose task is it to root it out? Answer me, ye who"
1086,IV.,"hear me!"""
1087,IV.,
1088,IV.,"A murmur of approbation ran round the assembly, whereat the patriarch"
1089,IV.,went on in a louder key.
1090,IV.,
1091,IV.,"""If there be young, untutored cattle in the herd, whose duty is it to"
1092,IV.,"see they do not gore the old? Answer ye who hear me!"""
1093,IV.,
1094,IV.,"But Gunesh Chund, knowing of old the length to which this system of"
1095,IV.,"exhortation could be extended, broke in quickly:"
1096,IV.,
1097,IV.,"""Granted that 'tis my task, wouldst thou have me root out mine own"
1098,IV.,"family?"""
1099,IV.,
1100,IV.,"""Nay!"" retorted the elder, laughing in proud anticipation of his own"
1101,IV.,"joke, ""I would have thee plant some more of the same stock.--Is it not"
1102,IV.,"so, my brothers?"""
1103,IV.,
1104,IV.,"This time a wheezy chuckle of assent came from the darkness, followed"
1105,IV.,by a fresh voice:
1106,IV.,
1107,IV.,"""A man without a son hath one life; a man rejoicing in a son hath"
1108,IV.,"two."""
1109,IV.,
1110,IV.,Then another took up the parable.
1111,IV.,
1112,IV.,"""Aye! and four hands to boot, wherewith to root out weeds."""
1113,IV.,
1114,IV.,"""The hundredfold wheat hath more stems than one,"" quoth a third."
1115,IV.,
1116,IV.,"""And a toddling child can drive bullocks,"" put in a fourth."
1117,IV.,
1118,IV.,"So in solemn adage ran the talk, with many a weighty pause, and many a"
1119,IV.,self-complacent wag of the head when the ball of ancient wit had been
1120,IV.,successfully passed to the next neighbour.
1121,IV.,
1122,IV.,"Accustomed as he was to this style of reasoning, each remark was a"
1123,IV.,fresh tap driving the nail of conviction into Gunesh Chund's slow
1124,IV.,"brain. As he stood on the roof that night, whence he could see the"
1125,IV.,"horizon strike the sky in one unbroken circle, a keen desire to live"
1126,IV.,as his fathers had lived excluded all other thoughts. Here was his
1127,IV.,world; here lay his duty.
1128,IV.,
1129,IV.,"""Thou canst choose a wife for me if thou wiliest,"" he said sheepishly"
1130,IV.,"to his mother, when, in the early dawn, he found her already at work,"
1131,IV.,while Veru lay abed with some ache or pain.
1132,IV.,
1133,IV.,"""O my son! O Guneshwa!"" cried the old woman, flinging her arms"
1134,IV.,"around his neck with unwonted tenderness, and with tears of joy in her"
1135,IV.,"bright old eyes. ""I will find thee a pearl and paragon. With a skin"
1136,IV.,"wheat-coloured, and--"""
1137,IV.,
1138,IV.,"""Nay, mother,"" interrupted the big man, still more sheepishly, ""an'"
1139,IV.,"she please thee, and have a soft tongue, that is all I care for. And,"
1140,IV.,"mother, say no word to Veru yet. There is time; and mayhap thou wilt"
1141,IV.,"not find a wife soon."""
1142,IV.,
1143,IV.,His mother laughed scornfully.
1144,IV.,
1145,IV.,"""Not find one to marry the _lumberdar!_ such a fine, straight man as"
1146,IV.,"thou art, Guneshwa. Why, they will come in crowds! Nay, be not so"
1147,IV.,"modest; that is the girl's part, not the man's. Nevertheless, as thou"
1148,IV.,"sayst, 'tis time enough to tell Veru when all things are settled."
1149,IV.,"There is but one woman needed in a marriage."""
1150,IV.,
1151,IV.,If some rankling doubt as to the honesty of his silence lingered in
1152,IV.,"Gunesh Chund's mind, it vanished quickly before the personal peace"
1153,IV.,which his decision brought to the household.
1154,IV.,
1155,IV.,Perhaps Veru might have wondered at the lull which thereinafter fell
1156,IV.,"over the combat, but that she herself was absorbed in a new hope of"
1157,IV.,"victory, and thought it possible that her keen-eyed mother-in-law"
1158,IV.,"might, in like manner, be preparing for defeat."
1159,IV.,
1160,IV.,"So the time of truce passed on; until one day, almost before Gunesh"
1161,IV.,"had realized his own capitulation, his mother informed him that a"
1162,IV.,bride had been found.
1163,IV.,
1164,IV.,"""So soon!"" he exclaimed, dismally. ""O mother, take care! Sure the"
1165,IV.,"choice of a plough-bullock would take me longer."""
1166,IV.,
1167,IV.,"""Then 'tis time to tell Veru,"" was his only remark, when the beauties,"
1168,IV.,"virtues, and charms of the young lady were dinned into his ears."
1169,IV.,"Whereupon his mother, with much inward contempt at his scruples, told"
1170,IV.,"him curtly that she had purposely chosen a bride from a far country,"
1171,IV.,"so that he need say nothing, since nothing would be known by others,"
1172,IV.,until the festivities began.
1173,IV.,
1174,IV.,"""I will tell her before then,"" he said, relieved; but somehow the days"
1175,IV.,"passed by, leaving behind them the silence that they found."
1176,IV.,
1177,IV.,Meanwhile Veru wearied Heaven with prayers and penances till she grew
1178,IV.,"thin and pale--given to fits of hysteria and tears, yet with a"
1179,IV.,triumphant look in her eyes as she listened to her mother-in-law's
1180,IV.,"constant allusions to her ill-health, with which the old lady"
1181,IV.,bolstered up Gunesh Chund's failing resolution. All three were too
1182,IV.,much occupied with their own thoughts and secrets to notice anything
1183,IV.,"unusual in the bearing of the others; or if they did notice it,"
1184,IV.,"naturally put the change down to vague suspicions, and so held their"
1185,IV.,own counsel more firmly.
1186,IV.,
1187,IV.,The crops were fast turning russet and gold under the glare of
1188,IV.,"sunlight succeeding to the monsoon rains, when Gunesh Chund said"
1189,IV.,"good-bye to his household for ten days, and rode by winding village"
1190,IV.,"ways to the broad white road that carried Western civilization, in the"
1191,IV.,"shape of a post-bag, through the district. Veru, clothed in madder and"
1192,IV.,"indigo, stood on the roof to watch him out of sight; loath to lose"
1193,IV.,"him, and regretting that she had not risked her secret ere he left."
1194,IV.,How much more would she have regretted it had she known that her
1195,IV.,"husband's destination lay far beyond his usual bourne, the Central"
1196,IV.,"Revenue Office, and that his bundle contained all things necessary"
1197,IV.,for the interchange of presents with a new bride! Meanwhile her
1198,IV.,"mother-in-law, stolidly at work below, wondered how any woman could be"
1199,IV.,so immodest as to show grief at a husband's departure. And Gunesh
1200,IV.,"Chund, riding between serried ranks of feather-topped maize and"
1201,IV.,"swelling bosses of millet, thought of the coming harvest. In a way,"
1202,IV.,each and all were looking forward with eager desire to reaping what
1203,IV.,they had sown; as if life held any other fate for humanity!
1204,IV.,
1205,IV.,"That same afternoon, Veru, unwilling to relax any of her efforts"
1206,IV.,"because of her hopes, set off to worship a snake which frequented an"
1207,IV.,old ant-hill at the farther end of the village common. The day had
1208,IV.,"been one of extreme heat, and a yellow dust-haze hung over everything."
1209,IV.,"Dust above, below, around her; only the ant-hill, furrowed by"
1210,IV.,"long-past rains into rugged pinnacles, rising clear and distinct. She"
1211,IV.,"was a timid woman, unused to roaming so far, and she looked fearfully"
1212,IV.,"around, dreading lest from one of the dark holes piercing the mound a"
1213,IV.,"hooded head might rear itself and speak to her. Such things had been,"
1214,IV.,she knew; for beneath the veneer of unbelief the old superstitions
1215,IV.,held her in thrall.
1216,IV.,
1217,IV.,"Hastily, yet carefully, lest evil should befall from any lack of"
1218,IV.,"ceremony, she ranged her sugar-cakes, hung up her chaplet of flowers,"
1219,IV.,and sprinkled the milk she had brought in a little brass pot with a
1220,IV.,"lavish hand; it left dark, ominous-looking stains on the white dust."
1221,IV.,
1222,IV.,"Glad to escape from such weird surroundings, yet feeling the need of"
1223,IV.,"rest, she drew aside among the wild caper-bushes, and sat down, wiping"
1224,IV.,the beads of perspiration from her forehead with the corner of her
1225,IV.,"veil. It felt quite hot against the damp skin, cooled by the fierce,"
1226,IV.,dry wind that even in this sheltered spot drove the dust along in
1227,IV.,"swirls. She drew her veil over her head and sat still as a statue, in"
1228,IV.,the curiously drooping attitude which to Western eyes suggests
1229,IV.,"absorbing grief; but Veru's mind was full of a great joy, which gained"
1230,IV.,no little sweetness from the thought of revenge. Yet as she dreamed
1231,IV.,"far away into the years, a spreading fold of her veil, caught in a"
1232,IV.,"caper-thorn, seemed pointing to something that glistened among the"
1233,IV.,"roots behind her. Veru, rising to go, stooped to disengage herself,"
1234,IV.,"and saw--a baby's bracelet! The next instant, with a shrill,"
1235,IV.,"high-pitched shriek of rage, she set off running towards the village."
1236,IV.,"Her mind, slow enough to take in novel ideas, needed no prompting"
1237,IV.,"here. It was little Nihâli's bracelet, and the explanation of this"
1238,IV.,fact followed as a matter of course. The dead child had been exposed
1239,IV.,"as an augury; _but what had the verdict been?_ Strange as it may seem,"
1240,IV.,"that thought came uppermost. Doubtless, had the truth been told her in"
1241,IV.,"the first freshness of bereavement, when the soft touch of the little"
1242,IV.,"hands and the clinging of the lips were more than a memory,"
1243,IV.,indignation and horror at the outrage on her child might have overcome
1244,IV.,"her curiosity. At any rate, the desire to pose as an advanced woman"
1245,IV.,"would have induced her to conceal it. But months had passed, bringing"
1246,IV.,"a new hope, to ensure which her inherited instincts would gladly have"
1247,IV.,"sacrificed more than a _dead_ girl. Indeed, the wish for some such"
1248,IV.,"augury had more than once invaded her, and lo! the sign had been"
1249,IV.,"given, and she knew nothing of it. That it had been favourable she"
1250,IV.,"assumed, believing that otherwise her mother-in-law would have"
1251,IV.,hastened to make it known. Unheard-of spite and cruelty!--but if it
1252,IV.,"were the climax, it should also be an end to tyranny. Trembling with"
1253,IV.,"excitement and the uneducated woman's desire for words, she ran"
1254,IV.,"forward panting and breathless, with little cries of anger and grief,"
1255,IV.,until she sank down exhausted with the unwonted exertion and her own
1256,IV.,"emotions. When she arose again, it was with greater calmness but more"
1257,IV.,resentment.
1258,IV.,
1259,IV.,"Her mother-in-law was toasting the new-made dough-cakes by the fire,"
1260,IV.,"when, after many pauses, Veru reached home. Wearied out, she leaned"
1261,IV.,"against the door-jamb for support ere commencing the fray, and looked"
1262,IV.,"at the elder woman with sombre, menacing eyes. The latter paid no"
1263,IV.,"attention, but went on tossing aside the heat-blistered cakes, and"
1264,IV.,placing others upright in the embers till they blew out like bladders.
1265,IV.,
1266,IV.,Suddenly Veru raised her hand; something gleaming flew through the
1267,IV.,"air, and the dead baby's bracelet fell at her enemy's feet and rolled"
1268,IV.,among the ashes.
1269,IV.,
1270,IV.,"""The jackals have sent thee a present, grandmother."""
1271,IV.,
1272,IV.,"The old woman looked at it, startled; then sprang up and faced her"
1273,IV.,adversary in fiercest indignation.
1274,IV.,
1275,IV.,"""What hast thou done, fool? Bringing the curse of girls back to the"
1276,IV.,"earth! The wild beasts were more merciful than thou art, for they gave"
1277,IV.,"no sign; and see, where the bread is baking thou hast thrown the"
1278,IV.,augury. O Guneshwa! O my son! would that thou wert here to see this
1279,IV.,witch casting her spells to bring barrenness to the bride thou art
1280,IV.,wooing! But no matter; the old mother will avert them; so bring home
1281,IV.,"thy bride, Guneshwa! bring home the virtuous Kirpa Devi, daughter of"
1282,IV.,"Kirpo Ram of Badrewallah!"""
1283,IV.,
1284,IV.,"Veru, struck dumb by the possible consequences of her own act, as"
1285,IV.,"revealed to her in her mother-in-law's unforeseen reproach, felt the"
1286,IV.,"whole world turn round as the old woman, roused out of caution, let"
1287,IV.,loose her secret and her tongue without reserve.
1288,IV.,
1289,IV.,"""It is not true! it is not true! Guneshwa would never deceive me so!"""
1290,IV.,was all the poor creature found to say against the torrent of words
1291,IV.,and facts.
1292,IV.,
1293,IV.,"""Not true!"" echoed the other, remorselessly. ""Come hither, and see if"
1294,IV.,"it be not true that a wedding is nigh."""
1295,IV.,
1296,IV.,"Seizing Veru by the wrist, she dragged her across the court-yard,"
1297,IV.,"flung open the store-room door, which was kept jealously locked"
1298,IV.,"against all intrusion, and pointed to a row of handkerchief-covered"
1299,IV.,"basket-trays, ranged in order on the ground."
1300,IV.,
1301,IV.,"""Behold!"" she cried, jeeringly, as she lifted the covering from one,"
1302,IV.,"displaying a pile of cheap tinsel-decked garments, such as are made to"
1303,IV.,"fill up the measure of more solid wedding presents. ""Guneshwa's mother"
1304,IV.,"is not so careless as his wife. Here is everything needful, and yonder"
1305,IV.,is the pile of dates whence he took the offering that went with him
1306,IV.,to-day. Stay--thou canst read! Put thy scholarship to some use for
1307,IV.,"once, and see if it be not true."""
1308,IV.,
1309,IV.,But Veru did not take the letters thrust at her; the shock was too
1310,IV.,"great, following on her excitement and utter weariness. She swayed as"
1311,IV.,"she stood, and with a cry of ""O Guneshwa, bring the dates back! bring"
1312,IV.,"them back!"" she fell in a heap among the baskets."
1313,IV.,
1314,IV.,"In the dawn of the next day, her mother-in-law, as she lay down to"
1315,IV.,"snatch a little sleep while one of her cronies watched by Veru's bed,"
1316,IV.,told herself that the house was cursed indeed! Who would have dreamed
1317,IV.,of the gods bringing such hopes to Veru? Who would have thought of her
1318,IV.,concealing them even for a day? And what a heritage of evil she would
1319,IV.,"leave behind her if she died now! Nihâli's augury was bad enough, but"
1320,IV.,what chance would there be for the new wife if the ghost of an
1321,IV.,expectant mother haunted the house?
1322,IV.,
1323,IV.,Veru must not die--should not die; so the old woman nursed her
1324,IV.,"tenderly, and strove in her rough way to bring comfort to the mind"
1325,IV.,stricken by mad jealousy and resentment.
1326,IV.,
1327,IV.,"""I _will_ die,"" was the only response; ""I will die and become a"
1328,IV.,"ghost![4] I will! I will!"""
1329,IV.,
1330,IV.,
1331,IV.,---------------------
1332,IV.,
1333,IV.,[Footnote 4: A woman dying with her unborn child has infinite power
1334,IV.,for ill.]
1335,IV.,
1336,IV.,---------------------
1337,IV.,
1338,IV.,
1339,IV.,"""Hearken, O Veru,"" replied her mother-in-law at last, ""thy dying will"
1340,IV.,"not harm any one, for if thou diest ere Guneshwa returns, I swear he"
1341,IV.,"shall never know a word, neither of thy hopes nor of thy fears! It"
1342,IV.,"shall be silence, silence forever, and who fears a ghost he knows not"
1343,IV.,"of? Answer me that!"""
1344,IV.,
1345,IV.,"And Veru, gripped in the stern old woman's greater strength, could"
1346,IV.,only turn her face to the wall sullenly.
1347,IV.,
1348,IV.,"""Hast thou no message for Guneshwa?"" asked the watcher at the last, as"
1349,IV.,Veru lay sinking.
1350,IV.,
1351,IV.,"""None--that--thou--wouldst--give,"" came the reply, with a strange"
1352,IV.,smile that remained on the lips even after death.
1353,IV.,
1354,IV.,"""Now, thank God, neither Guneshwa nor his bride need know aught of"
1355,IV.,"this!"" thought the old lady, as they streaked the corpse with many a"
1356,IV.,weird ceremony and precaution.
1357,IV.,
1358,IV.,
1359,IV.,
1360,V.,V.
1361,V.,
1362,V.,The moon shone brightly as Gunesh Chund rode through the village
1363,V.,common on his homeward way. There was scarcely a track to be seen on
1364,V.,"the hard, white ground, where the sparse bushes close at hand lay like"
1365,V.,"shadows here and there, but in the distance blended themselves into a"
1366,V.,"grey line against the lighter sky. No visible track, yet the"
1367,V.,"_lumberdar's_ pony picked its way unerringly, true as the needle,"
1368,V.,towards the manger awaiting it; instinct or habit supplying the place
1369,V.,of reason. Its rider could boast of no such contented certainty.
1370,V.,"Something--what, he would have been puzzled to say--had made the path"
1371,V.,"of custom seem doubtful, without supplying him with a new or clearer"
1372,V.,"road. And, overlying the dull sense of discomfort, was a distinct"
1373,V.,remorse for the deceit to which his honest if sluggish soul was quite
1374,V.,"a stranger. The memory of his promise troubled him, although he quite"
1375,V.,"acknowledged that a _pudmuni_, or ideal Hindu wife, would never have"
1376,V.,claimed its fulfilment.
1377,V.,
1378,V.,"Suddenly his pony started and swerved, throwing him forward in his"
1379,V.,shovel stirrups.
1380,V.,
1381,V.,In his efforts to keep in his seat the cause seemed to be the sudden
1382,V.,"appearance of a veiled woman, beckoning with outstretched hands; but"
1383,V.,"when he could give a calmer look, the difference in position caused by"
1384,V.,his pony's advance showed him that it was but the dead trunk of a
1385,V.,tree. With a sign of relief he gave the animal a dig in the sides.
1386,V.,
1387,V.,"""'Tis thinking so much of women-folk does it,"" he said to himself. ""I"
1388,V.,"weary for the ploughing and peace."""
1389,V.,
1390,V.,"A sense of well-being came over him at the familiar sights and sounds,"
1391,V.,as he neared the village. Even the dogs barking in chorus at the
1392,V.,"pony's echoing steps seemed to him a welcome, and the house, quiet"
1393,V.,"and dark though it was, a haven of rest after the hustle and bustle of"
1394,V.,his rapid excursion into an unknown world. The door of the inner court
1395,V.,"was closed, for he was not expected till dawn, and he stood for an"
1396,V.,"instant beside it, listening. All was still as death, and with another"
1397,V.,sigh of relief he stumbled up the steep stairs to his favourite
1398,V.,sleeping-place.
1399,V.,
1400,V.,"How calm it was there under the stars; how clear the path, now that he"
1401,V.,"was at home once more among familiar landmarks! Why, if difficulties"
1402,V.,"arose, had they not arisen over and over again in the lives of those"
1403,V.,who had gone before him? What more easy than to adopt the ancient
1404,V.,"remedy, and, by building a new court for the new wife, separate the"
1405,V.,"jealous women! His mother would, of course, side with her own choice;"
1406,V.,"so Veru, far from having any ground of complaint, would find greater"
1407,V.,"peace than heretofore. In his quiet, limited way, he loved her more"
1408,V.,"than he would have cared to avow, and so, thinking of her ease, he"
1409,V.,fell asleep full of content.
1410,V.,
1411,V.,"The night passed, the dawn lightened into sunshine; yet still he"
1412,V.,"slept, wearied out by his ten days' exile from the village. And so it"
1413,V.,"came to pass that his mother, apprised of his return by finding the"
1414,V.,"pony in its accustomed place, had to rouse him by sad words."
1415,V.,
1416,V.,"""Awake, O Gunesh Chund, son of Anant Ram, and make thy heart strong,"
1417,V.,"for Veru thy wife is dead."""
1418,V.,
1419,V.,"A sad amaze, an almost pitiful resignation, followed the first"
1420,V.,"incredulity; and then, as he sat below, patiently waiting for many a"
1421,V.,"rite and conventional lamentation, the memory of his last waking"
1422,V.,thought returned to him.
1423,V.,
1424,V.,"""I thought of building her a new house for peace' sake,"" he said,"
1425,V.,"wistfully, to his mother; ""and lo! the Great Ones have given her a"
1426,V.,"grave and peace forever."""
1427,V.,
1428,V.,"""Perhaps 'tis as well, Guneshwa!"" replied the old woman, softened by"
1429,V.,"his gentle grief. ""Her health was poor, and if Death drew nigh, it was"
1430,V.,"better he should come before the bride."""
1431,V.,
1432,V.,"Perhaps 'twas as well! That was all her tongue found to say, but her"
1433,V.,heart rejoiced exceedingly that eternal silence had fallen over the
1434,V.,"dead wife's reproaches. If Premi and Chuni only held their tongues, as"
1435,V.,"they always did if it was made worth their while, neither Gunesh Chund"
1436,V.,"nor his bride need know the curse that had come upon them. Above all,"
1437,V.,the soft-hearted bridegroom would be saved the daily terror of seeing
1438,V.,the fatal ghost.
1439,V.,
1440,V.,"Even as it were, the autumn chills were upon him, making him shiver"
1441,V.,"and shake, and bringing the haggard, ague-stricken look so common at"
1442,V.,that time of year to his sad face. He took little interest in the
1443,V.,"preparations which his mother pressed on with feverish haste, but"
1444,V.,"passed days and nights out of doors among his fields, going the round"
1445,V.,"of the crops with the village accountant, and seeing to the payment of"
1446,V.,revenue dues.
1447,V.,
1448,V.,"""Thou takest no rest, Gunesh Chund,"" exclaimed his mother,"
1449,V.,"indignantly, when he pleaded business as an excuse for not going to"
1450,V.,the silversmith's to hurry him up with the remodelling of poor Veru's
1451,V.,"ornaments. ""A _lumberdar_ was a _lumberdar_ long before the _sahibs_"
1452,V.,came to the land. What is it to thee if they want this written one
1453,V.,"way, and that another? There were no such piles of papers in thy"
1454,V.,"father's day, and he was a better _lumberdar_ than thou wilt ever be."""
1455,V.,
1456,V.,"""Mayhap, mother; but somehow 'tis ill work nowadays doing things as"
1457,V.,"they used to be done. It suits no one, not even thee."""
1458,V.,
1459,V.,"""Not suit me--I'd like to know--"""
1460,V.,
1461,V.,"""Nay! are not the old trinkets being altered even now. For my part, I"
1462,V.,"liked them best as they were."""
1463,V.,
1464,V.,"""Guneshwa thou art a ninny! But thou wilt sing another song when the"
1465,V.,bride comes to thee adorned. That new silversmith hath done well.
1466,V.,There is a fashion of necklet--French pattern he called it--like
1467,V.,"needlework for fineness. And I have not forgotten the old ways, for"
1468,V.,"the talisman Veru wore is made into a _saukinmhora_, to keep her ghost"
1469,V.,"away."""
1470,V.,
1471,V.,"The _lumberdar's_ face assumed a startled, alarmed look."
1472,V.,
1473,V.,"""The ghost, mother! Wherefore the ghost? Veru was a good wife, loving"
1474,V.,"me, and I was a good husband to her. There was no ill-will betwixt us,"
1475,V.,"surely."""
1476,V.,
1477,V.,His mother could have bitten her tongue out for her inadvertence.
1478,V.,
1479,V.,"""'Twas but a thoughtless word, O my son, and I am over-anxious. Surely"
1480,V.,the woman took too many blessings from thee in life to give thee
1481,V.,"curses in death. And see,"" she added, hastily, in the hope of"
1482,V.,"diverting his eager anxiety, ""I have found what thou wert asking"
1483,V.,for--the certificates of thy fathers to many and many a generation.
1484,V.,"Thou hadst given them into Veru's keeping, but they are too precious"
1485,V.,for a woman's holding. Who knows but she has lost some? Squandering
1486,V.,thy son's heritage out of spite! Who canst give back the praises of
1487,V.,"the dead?"""
1488,V.,
1489,V.,"So she went on in purposeful grumbling, while Gunesha, opening the"
1490,V.,"handkerchief in which the precious documents were folded, counted the"
1491,V.,frayed papers laboriously.
1492,V.,
1493,V.,"""Nay! they are here, and more; let me count again. Surely, there are"
1494,V.,"thirty-and-two, and when the canal _sahib_ gave me his last year there"
1495,V.,"were but thirty-and-one. Thirty-and-one, no more."""
1496,V.,
1497,V.,"He sat down on the door-step, shifting the papers through his awkward"
1498,V.,"hands, with the uncertain eyes of one who, being unable to read, has"
1499,V.,"to seek recognition through more devious ways. His mother, meanwhile,"
1500,V.,"utterly indifferent, had turned to some household occupation."
1501,V.,
1502,V.,"""See, there is a new one; that one, may be; 'tis cleaner than the"
1503,V.,"rest,"" he muttered to himself, opening up the folded sheet conspicuous"
1504,V.,by its whiteness.
1505,V.,
1506,V.,"It was written in the Nagari character, and his puzzled face cleared"
1507,V.,at the sight.
1508,V.,
1509,V.,"""'Tis all right, mother!"" he exclaimed; ""there are but thirty one. The"
1510,V.,"other is a letter."""
1511,V.,
1512,V.,"He was about to add a suggestion that Veru might have written it, but"
1513,V.,"checked himself, from fear of starting another tirade against the dead"
1514,V.,woman.
1515,V.,
1516,V.,"""A letter!"" echoed his mother, contemptuously. ""Throw it in the fire!"
1517,V.,I have no patience with folk who find their tongues too short to touch
1518,V.,"friend or foe."""
1519,V.,
1520,V.,"""But, mother,"" returned Gunesh, with a smile, ""even thy tongue is not"
1521,V.,"long enough to reach over the world."""
1522,V.,
1523,V.,"""And wherefore should I try? I tell thee, Guneshwa, that we"
1524,V.,peasant-folk have naught to do with the world. What he can touch with
1525,V.,"his hands is a man's portion till he dies, and 'tis theft to go"
1526,V.,beyond. Writing is no good except for certificates. There is Devi
1527,V.,"Ditta's house thrown into grief, just as the boy's betrothal began, by"
1528,V.,the news of his father being killed in Burma. God knows where Burma
1529,V.,"is. Far enough, may be, to keep the news back till a more convenient"
1530,V.,"time, if it came as God meant it to come. And the man is dead,"
1531,V.,"anyhow."""
1532,V.,
1533,V.,But Gunesh Chund refolded the paper and placed it in his waistband.
1534,V.,His friend the accountant could tell him its purport.
1535,V.,
1536,V.,"""The chills again?"" asked his mother, with no anxiety in her voice,"
1537,V.,"when, coming back from Devi Ditta's house with a throat rendered"
1538,V.,"hoarse by neighbourly lamentations, she found her son huddled up under"
1539,V.,"his quilt. ""You must get the sahib's white powder. For a wonder, it"
1540,V.,"does good."""
1541,V.,
1542,V.,"""Quinine will not cure me, mother,"" he replied in a curiously muffled"
1543,V.,voice that startled the hearer by its dull despair.
1544,V.,
1545,V.,"""What ails thee, then, Guneshwa?"""
1546,V.,
1547,V.,The man sat up amid his heavy wrappings and looked at her without
1548,V.,"resentment. The ague cramped his blue fingers, and made him draw"
1549,V.,"shuddering breaths through widely distended nostrils, as he sat gazing"
1550,V.,"at her with wild eyes full of a mute appeal and reproach. Then, with a"
1551,V.,"little, almost childish cry, he fell back among the quilts once more."
1552,V.,
1553,V.,"""Thou knowest, mother; thou knowest it well."""
1554,V.,
1555,V.,"Her heart throbbed, but her voice was steady as she replied:"
1556,V.,
1557,V.,"""What do I know, O Gunesh Chund?"""
1558,V.,
1559,V.,"""That Veru kept her promise and I broke mine! She knew you would not"
1560,V.,"tell me, so she wrote. That was the letter."""
1561,V.,
1562,V.,"The old woman stood for an instant bewildered. Then, as she realized"
1563,V.,"that all her wisdom had not availed against the dead wife's knowledge,"
1564,V.,she threw her lean arms up over her head and beat her hands together
1565,V.,"wildly, while the court re-echoed with her high, resonant voice."
1566,V.,
1567,V.,"""She wrote it? Now may God curse her utterly! My curse upon her and"
1568,V.,"every woman who learns--"""
1569,V.,
1570,V.,A shivering hand reached out towards her.
1571,V.,
1572,V.,"""Hush, mother! I have had enough of curses to-day."""
1573,V.,
1574,V.,The mild reproof made her forget her anger in thoughts for him.
1575,V.,
1576,V.,"""Light of mine eyes! heart of my heart!"" she cried, flinging herself"
1577,V.,"on her knees by the bed and stretching the arms, but now raised in"
1578,V.,"cursing, around him in fierce protecting. ""She cannot hurt thee--she"
1579,V.,"dare not, if charms avail. The iron rings are about her hands and"
1580,V.,"feet, the nails are through her cursed, writing fingers--would God"
1581,V.,they had been there ere she wrote that letter!--and the mustard-seed
1582,V.,"lies thick between her grave and the hearth. I have sown it, and will"
1583,V.,"sow it with each new moon. Look up, Guneshwa! She cannot, she dare not"
1584,V.,"return."""
1585,V.,
1586,V.,"""She hath returned already."""

1597,V.,
1598,V.,"""There will be no need to weep at all, my son,"" she said, crushing"
1599,V.,"down her own dread in order to lessen his, and fiercely determining to"

1601,V.,
1602,V.,"She kept her word; though, as the days passed on, even her wilful"
1603,V.,blindness could not fail to see how the strong man grew weaker and
1604,V.,"weaker. Her heart stood still with fear, as she watched for the sleep"
1605,V.,"of exhaustion which followed each successive attack of fever and ague,"
1606,V.,before stealing away to seize the opportunity for the charms she dared
1607,V.,not work save in secrecy.
1608,V.,
1609,V.,"Indeed, the subject was barred between them; and even when the fever"
1610,V.,"fiend held him in its grip, Gunesh Chund never alluded again to the"

1612,V.,
1613,V.,"He put aside the _saukin-mhora_ which, in her clutching at straws, she"

1619,V.,
1620,V.,"For all the courage of his words, a conviction that he was doomed"

1623,V.,restlessness.
1624,V.,
1625,V.,"""I will go and stop at the well, mother,"" he said at last; ""the air is"

1667,THE BLUE MONKEY.,The following story shows the effect that a blue monkey on a gilt
1668,THE BLUE MONKEY.,spike had in a remote Indian village called Jehâdpore--a very ordinary
1669,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"village set out on high, unirrigated soil, beside a large irregular"
1670,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"tank, whence the bricks of many generations of houses had been dug;"
1671,THE BLUE MONKEY.,the only peculiarity about it being a glaringly whitewashed mosque
1672,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"façade, rising above the whole and flanked by a palm-tree. Merely a"
1673,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"façade: viewed frontwise, distinctly imposing, with minarets and domes"
1674,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"in orthodox numbers and positions; viewed sidewise, as distinctly"
1675,THE BLUE MONKEY.,disappointing. The jerriest of London jerry builders could have done
1676,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"nothing better than this one brick front elevation, of which even the"
1677,THE BLUE MONKEY.,domes were but _basso-relievos_.
1678,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1679,THE BLUE MONKEY.,Still it dominated the village in every way; for it was built in the
1680,THE BLUE MONKEY.,court-yard of ex-Rissaldar-Major Azmutoollah Khan Sahib Bahadur's
1681,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"house, and he with his hangers-on represented Jehâdpore. It was a"
1682,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Rângur village--that is to say, a village of Mohammedan Rajputs, a"
1683,THE BLUE MONKEY.,race which supplies half the native cavalry of upper India with
1684,THE BLUE MONKEY.,recruits. That was the case at Jehâdpore. When the district officer
1685,THE BLUE MONKEY.,came round every year to attest and write up the big village note-book
1686,THE BLUE MONKEY.,there was always something to add on this score. Either the number of
1687,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"those away a-soldiering had to be increased, or an entry made that"
1688,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"So-and-so had returned with a ""_pinson_""[5] to his wife and family. On"
1689,THE BLUE MONKEY.,these occasions the district officer invariably found an escort
1690,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"awaiting him at the boundary, consisting of _sowars_ on leave"
1691,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"from various regiments (with their horses), a contingent of"
1692,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""_pinson-wallahs_"" in nondescript uniform on broodmares, and Khan"
1693,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Azmutoollah Khan Bahadur, C.I.E., ex-_rissaldar_, at their head. He"
1694,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"was a very old man, as deeply wrinkled as a young actor doing the part"
1695,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"of an ancient retainer. In the privacy of that court-yard, garnished"
1696,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"by the jerry mosque, he clothed himself scantily in limp white muslin,"
1697,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"and his beard was tricoloured--white at the roots, red in the middle,"
1698,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"purple at the ends. But on his screaming stallion, sword in hand, a"
1699,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"goodly row of medals on his worn tunic, Azmutoollah's beard was of the"
1700,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"fiercest black, and the line of moustache shaved from the hard mouth"
1701,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"into an arched curve under his aquiline nose, curled right up to his"
1702,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"eyes. His voice, too, lost its quaver of age, and before he had safely"
1703,THE BLUE MONKEY.,inducted the _Huzoor_ into his tents down by the tank that irregular
1704,THE BLUE MONKEY.,troop of cavalry had been put through enough man[oe]uvres to last out
1705,THE BLUE MONKEY.,three ordinary field days. It was the old soldier's _Kriegspiel_.

1720,THE BLUE MONKEY.,Then he had to resume the old uniform once more and go over to the
1721,THE BLUE MONKEY.,tents again with a petition. Rângurs always have petitions about
1722,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"wells, or water, or brood mares; for, if they make excellent troopers,"
1723,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"they are intolerably bad ploughmen. That was why Mool Raj, the"

1727,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"The ex-_rissaldar_, with two sons and three grandsons in the old"

1730,THE BLUE MONKEY.,element the latter represented in Jehâdpore. The fact that the

1732,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"the position of affairs at all, or detract from the feeling of"
1733,THE BLUE MONKEY.,virtuous tolerance which allowed a most modest and retiring Hindu
1734,THE BLUE MONKEY.,temple to conceal itself behind the back wall of the mosque façade. It
1735,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"was a great concession, for Azmutoollah was not the only _Hâdji_[6] in"
1736,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Jehâdpore. The place was a perfect hot-bed of fighting Mohammedanism,"

1784,THE BLUE MONKEY.,The usurer came back from his interview with his patron quite
1785,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"resigned. To tell the truth, he himself was not much set on these"
1786,THE BLUE MONKEY.,pious additions which cost a heap of hard-won money. Their initiator
1787,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"was Hunumân's mother, who, ever since her pilgrimage to Shah Sultan"
1788,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"had been rewarded by the long-prayed-for son, had looked on him as"
1789,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"doubly dependent on the favour of the gods--his very name, Hunumân,"
1790,THE BLUE MONKEY.,having been bestowed on him because she had seen a monkey when she
1791,THE BLUE MONKEY.,first regained consciousness after the curious hysterical crisis which
1792,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"seizes on most women at that most famous shrine. The inference being,"
1793,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"of course, that the monkey god was responsible for the baby--a"
1794,THE BLUE MONKEY.,presumption not in the least weakened by the fact that Shah Sultan was
1795,THE BLUE MONKEY.,a Mohammedan saint to whom monkeys and gods were an abomination.
1796,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1797,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Chand Kor, therefore, gave shrill disapproval to Azmutoollah's fiat."
1798,THE BLUE MONKEY.,In her heart of hearts she nourished the ideal of a blue monkey god
1799,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"perched on the top of that golden spike; and when, two days"
1800,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"afterwards, Hunumân Sing, B.A., came down for his vacation, she poured"
1801,THE BLUE MONKEY.,the tale of intolerance into his ear.
1802,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1803,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Now, Hunumân Sing, after the manner of his kind, did not care--well,"
1804,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"what the Iron Duke said cost him twopence--for his godfather, nor,"
1805,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"indeed, for most of the beliefs of his mother. How could he? Who could"
1806,THE BLUE MONKEY.,expect it of him? The cry which goes up now and again in India when
1807,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"some clever lad, educated at a mission-school, openly forsakes his"
1808,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"religion, is beneath contempt. There is not one orthodox Hindu father,"
1809,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"north or south, who, pushing his lad on for the sake of worldly"
1810,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"success, does not do it with his eyes open to the inevitable gulf"
1811,THE BLUE MONKEY.,which must separate them in the future. This particular son was like
1812,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"many another son of the sort; a good lad, on the whole, if more"
1813,THE BLUE MONKEY.,interested in his own development than anything else in the world.
1814,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"This, again, was inevitable. When you have to cram the evolution of"
1815,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"ages into two-and-twenty years, and grow from a baby named after the"
1816,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"monkey god into a B.A., a strict attention to business is necessary."
1817,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"If he was pushing, was not that also inevitable? Jonah's gourd had to"
1818,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"push ""some,"" as the Americans say. For the rest, he was like hundreds"
1819,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"of the amiable, clever young graduates whom one longs to have in the"
1820,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"desert for forty days and nights opposite the Sphinx. One by one, of"
1821,THE BLUE MONKEY.,course; for if there were two of them they would form a sub-committee
1822,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"and vote the Sphinx to the chair. Then the millennium would come, of"
1823,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"course, and that would be inconvenient for _nous autres_."
1824,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1825,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"But, though Hunumân cared not at all for the blue monkey god, he"
1826,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"worshipped liberty--especially his own; and he preferred it, if"
1827,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"possible, with a flavour of law about it. What! deprive a citizen, a"
1828,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"subject of the Queen Empress, from due exercise of religious right?"
1829,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Who was Azmutoollah Khan, to promulgate such a pernicious attempt at"

1832,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Little Mool Raj, who seemed to shrivel smaller as he grew older,"
1833,THE BLUE MONKEY.,listened to all this with great pride but steadfast inaction. He knew
1834,THE BLUE MONKEY.,who Azmutoollah Khan was well enough. He knew the temper of the people
1835,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"who had enriched him all too well. Liberty was a fine thing, but money"
1836,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"was better--peace and comfort best of all. This latter conviction,"
1837,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"however, made him give way slightly before Chand Kor's tears; and the"
1838,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"next evening, when the _rissaldar_--major was interviewing two new"
1839,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"arrivals on leave, and bringing the wisdom of a lifetime to bear on"
1840,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"their horses, an odd noise floated over the sham domes of the mosque."

1847,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"two boys, heads down, arms interlaced, wrestling stark naked in the"

1849,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"gamut, beginning with an earthquake, passing on to a foghorn, and"

1861,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1862,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"If the opponents had been better matched, there would have been"

1869,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1870,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"A roar of laughter went up from the crowd, as, alarmed but determined,"
1871,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"he backed from the onslaught to the temple door, stumbled on the step,"

1886,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1887,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"The spirit was willing, but the flesh, in the hustling hands of half a"

1902,THE BLUE MONKEY.,newly acquired love of freedom overflow into eloquence. Heart and head
1903,THE BLUE MONKEY.,were both full to inflation with the finest sentiments. As he stood on

1955,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"left in the _sahibs_ still, in spite of their setting goldsmiths'"
1956,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"sons, like Amr Nath, to rule over honest folk."
1957,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1958,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""I'm dashed if I can find a precedent,"" remarked the district officer,"
1959,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"disconsolately talking over the matter with the policeman, the doctor,"
1960,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"and the assistant. ""And in a case like this, where every thing depends"
1961,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"on the environment, and it's sure to be appealed again, there is no"
1962,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"mortal good in anything but a precedent. If I say there will be a row,"
1963,THE BLUE MONKEY.,I shall only be told with great dignity that Mr. Smith is expected to
1964,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"keep his district in order."""
1965,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1966,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"There was a pause. Finally, the doctor spoke. He hailed from Aberdeen."
1967,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1968,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""It's an ill burd that files his ain nest, but for religious"
1969,THE BLUE MONKEY.,into-lerance give me Scotland. Aw'm no saying ut'll hold as a
1970,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"preeceedent amongst the heathen, but it's a preeceedent in the Court"
1971,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"o' Session. It was _aprepaw_ of a bell."""
1972,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1973,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""A bell! Heaven be praised! the very thing."""
1974,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1975,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""A bell is not a conch,"" remarked the assistant."
1976,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1977,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""Alias, I should say,"" murmured the policeman. ""Bell, conch, call to"
1978,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"prayer: that's the spirit. Fire away, old chap!--Bearer, bring the"
1979,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"doctor-_sahib_ another peg."""
1980,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1981,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"So the precedent of a far-away cathedral, whose schismatic chime"
1982,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"annoyed good Calvinists, was brought to bear on Hunumân and the conch,"
1983,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"and the latter, not being an integral part of public worship, was"
1984,THE BLUE MONKEY.,proclaimed a nuisance.
1985,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1986,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"The deputy commissioner himself had no doubt about its being one, as"
1987,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"he wiped the perspiration from his brow, and remarked to Dhunput Rai"
1988,THE BLUE MONKEY.,that that ought to finish the business.
1989,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1990,THE BLUE MONKEY.,The courteous old gentleman smiled.
1991,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1992,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""_Huzoor_,"" he said, ""I have heard my father say that Akbar's order to"
1993,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"his judges was, 'Write ever with the pen which has been cut by the"
1994,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"sword; then there is peace in the land.' The case will be appealed,"
1995,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"and the pen of the _Huzoors_ is cut by machine."""
1996,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
1997,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"He was a true prophet. Hunumân, backed by the 'Sun of Asia,' not only"
1998,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"appealed the conch question, but raised another in the interim by"
1999,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"putting a small blue plaster monkey on the top of the gold spike, in"
2000,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"fulfilment, it was urged, of the pre-natal vow made for him by his"
2001,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"mother, a pious Hindu lady, whose virtuous life was crowned with"
2002,THE BLUE MONKEY.,honour.
2003,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2004,THE BLUE MONKEY.,The monkey remained there exactly five-and-twenty minutes after the
2005,THE BLUE MONKEY.,first beams of the rising sun disclosed the fact that it had been put
2006,THE BLUE MONKEY.,there during the night. That it remained so long was due to three
2007,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"reasons: First, that the Jehâdpore troopers, if good swordsmen, were"
2008,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"uncommonly bad shots; second, that Azmutoollah's blunderbuss was a"
2009,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"flint-lock; third, that he insisted on letting it off himself until it"
2010,THE BLUE MONKEY.,knocked him down.
2011,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2012,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"This time the case was taken direct to the deputy commissioner, who,"
2013,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"urged on the one side by a remembrance of Dhunput Rai's remark, and on"
2014,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"the other by a sneaking fear of revision, decided that the blue"
2015,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"monkey, as an idolatrous image, was a distinct nuisance when displayed"
2016,THE BLUE MONKEY.,unnecessarily over the top of a Mohammedan gentleman's private mosque.
2017,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"On the other hand, viewed from the Hindu standpoint, the image of a"
2018,THE BLUE MONKEY.,blue monkey might be an integral part of public worship. Azmutoollah
2019,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Khan Bahadur, C.I.E., ex-rissaldar, must therefore pay over to Mool"
2020,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Raj and to Hunumân Sing the price of the destroyed blue monkey, as"
2021,THE BLUE MONKEY.,they might wish to erect a similar one in a less conspicuous place.
2022,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2023,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Now, though Mool Raj's name was duly entered in the file as"
2024,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"complainant, the affair had long ago passed out of his hands and"
2025,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"become a real, solid, Heaven-sent grievance to a small knot of"
2026,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"advanced young pleaders. Indeed, the old man was so distinctly"
2027,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"unsatisfactory as chief victim, that they had more than once taken the"
2028,THE BLUE MONKEY.,opportunity of his absence to advance matters a step. Azmutoollah
2029,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Khan, as shrewd an old soldier as could be found on either side of the"
2030,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Indus, was not slow to notice this, and his blind opposition covered a"
2031,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"great longing to have these youngsters on the hip. After all, he and"
2032,THE BLUE MONKEY.,Mool Raj had pulled along well enough for years before this B.A. was
2033,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"thought of--ay, and their fathers before them. If the usurer had been"
2034,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"alone, the money screw could have been put on him somehow; since he"
2035,THE BLUE MONKEY.,would not risk a pice for all the blue monkeys in heaven or on earth.
2036,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2037,THE BLUE MONKEY.,Azmutoollah Khan was cogitating these matters one afternoon on the
2038,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"wooden bed, with his turban as usual standing like a helmet beside"
2039,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"him, when a party of boys rushed into the court-yard full of news and"
2040,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"excitement. Hunumân Sing, who, as every one knew, had come with some"
2041,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"friends in a bullock cart that morning, must have brought the thing"
2042,THE BLUE MONKEY.,with him; but as sure as fate there was a blue monkey sitting on the
2043,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"square pedestal in front of the temple which Alla Ditta, the mason,"
2044,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"had built in all innocence of heart last week--a blue monkey, not a"
2045,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"miniature marionette at the top of a gilt spike like the last, but a"
2046,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"life-sized affair, and, what is more, all the Hindus in the place and"
2047,THE BLUE MONKEY.,many more from neighbouring villages were doing _poojah_ to it.
2048,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2049,THE BLUE MONKEY.,The fierce old Mohammedan's very lips turned pale. He never even
2050,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"thought of his turban, but, bald-headed as he was, and stumbling in"
2051,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"his haste, was out of the court-yard into the narrow street. The next"
2052,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"minute a cry, that was not pleasant to hear, cut the calm sunshine"
2053,THE BLUE MONKEY.,like a sword.
2054,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2055,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""_Jehâd! Jehâd! Futt-eh Mohammed! Jehâd! Jehâd! Futt-eh Mohammed!_"""
2056,THE BLUE MONKEY.,shrilled the boys in refrain.
2057,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2058,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"A knot of young men in patent-leather shoes, standing by the blue"
2059,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"monkey, heard the cry with a glow of triumph."
2060,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2061,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""Brothers and sisters,"" called one, in the polished, curiously"
2062,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"artificial tones of one accustomed to public speaking, ""remember we"
2063,THE BLUE MONKEY.,are peaceable citizens. There is to be no opposition. Our trust is in
2064,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"truth and justice, not in violence. Our weapon is right, not might."
2065,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Stand aside and let them do their worst. 'I will repay,' saith the"
2066,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"law."""
2067,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2068,THE BLUE MONKEY.,It was a bold paraphrase lost on all save that little knot of culture
2069,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"which said, ""Hear, hear!"" as if to the manner born. The speech,"
2070,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"however, though admirable, proved somewhat superfluous. The first"
2071,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"sight of that mad assault coming round the corner sent the crowd,"
2072,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"composed for the most part of women and children, scattering hither"
2073,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"and thither like frightened sheep. Culture stood firm, unwisely firm,"
2074,THE BLUE MONKEY.,for a minute. Then a voice rose in English:
2075,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2076,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""Gentlemen, discretion is better part of valour--nor is it permissible"
2077,THE BLUE MONKEY.,to foster or excite breach of peace. We can speak with equal fluence
2078,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"and freedom from roof of house."" And they did."
2079,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2080,THE BLUE MONKEY.,The scene thus described sounds farcical. There was not even a grain
2081,THE BLUE MONKEY.,of comedy in it to the actors; least of all to the plaster monkey on
2082,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"whose blue hide the sabres hacked fast. Above, on the roof, as on a"
2083,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"hustings, the new culture wielded the sword of the Spirit; below, the"
2084,THE BLUE MONKEY.,older cult clinched argument by the sword of the flesh.
2085,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2086,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"That night peace reigned in Jehâdpore. Young India, in a body, had"
2087,THE BLUE MONKEY.,gone to report wilful destruction of private property accompanied by
2088,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"violence, to the deputy commissioner. Old India sat triumphant but"
2089,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"thoughtful on the wooden bed, while the troopers laughed and drank and"
2090,THE BLUE MONKEY.,made merry over the discomfiture of the blue monkey.
2091,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2092,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""By the Prophet,"" cried Rahmat Ali, ""I swear it had a look of old"

2096,THE BLUE MONKEY.,waiting leisure to burn his books and clear off old scores in the old
2097,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"way. He wept, and said 'twas none of his doing; that he asked but"
2098,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"peace, as in the old days. Yea, as he sat a-begging on his haunches,"
2099,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"praying forgiveness, he looked more like the blue monkey than ever."""
2100,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2101,THE BLUE MONKEY.,Khan Azmutoollah Khan let off a detonating _roulade_ of Arabic

2103,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2104,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""Fetch him here, Rahmat! I have a plan. We old folk will settle it old"
2105,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"ways."""
2106,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2107,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"The next morning the deputy commissioner, the police officer, and the"
2108,THE BLUE MONKEY.,doctor rode out in hot haste to the scene of what they were told had
2109,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"been a bloodthirsty riot. At the village boundary they were met,"
2110,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"rather to their surprise, by the usual escort. The leader of the"
2111,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"little band was more military than ever, but there was an odd twinkle"
2112,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"in his eye as he obeyed the curt order to fall behind, and the"
2113,THE BLUE MONKEY.,hint--which British majesty gave in the interests of law and
2114,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"order--that his presence even there was undesirable. Hunumân Sing, and"
2115,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"a friend who had remained to see fair play, certainly seemed to think"
2116,THE BLUE MONKEY.,the troopers jingling and clashing along in close order very much in
2117,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"their way. They edged their ponies here and there, only to find"
2118,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"themselves perpetually ridden over; especially when, at the head of"
2119,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"the lane leading to the temple, British majesty reined up short, the"
2120,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"troop behind turned to stone, the horses on their haunches steady as"
2121,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"rocks. Then there was a wild hustle; the two ponies shot out in front,"
2122,THE BLUE MONKEY.,where their owners managed to pull up flabbergasted at the sight which
2123,THE BLUE MONKEY.,met their eyes.
2124,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2125,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""How is this?"" asked the deputy commissioner, sternly. ""I thought you"
2126,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"said the blue monkey was destroyed; and there it is, in perfect"
2127,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"condition!"""
2128,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2129,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"There it was, indubitably--bright blue, with a long tail curving over"
2130,THE BLUE MONKEY.,its legs.
2131,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2132,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"From behind among the troopers came gentle grunts of disapproval, that"
2133,THE BLUE MONKEY.,the ears of the _Huzoor_ should be assailed with such wanton lies.
2134,THE BLUE MONKEY.,Blue monkeys indeed! What quarrel had the faithful with blue monkeys?
2135,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2136,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""Khan Azmutoollah Khan sahib,"" called British majesty, ""what does this"
2137,THE BLUE MONKEY.,mean? I was told you and your fellows had wantonly destroyed Mool
2138,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Raj's monkey. Is this true?"""
2139,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2140,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"The old man rode up from behind, his martial dignity undimmed by the"

2142,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2143,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""I am no scholar myself, _Huzoor_,"" he said, saluting, ""but I am a"
2144,THE BLUE MONKEY.,just man for all that. I injure neither man nor beast wantonly. Let
2145,THE BLUE MONKEY.,the _Huzoor_ ask the blue monkey if it or its master hath aught
2146,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"against me. Of these""--here he gave a contemptuous wave of his hand to"
2147,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"the pleaders on their ponies--""I know naught, nor did my fathers."""
2148,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2149,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Then he rode forward. ""Oh, _bunder-jee!_ speak for thyself and for thy"
2150,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"master."""
2151,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2152,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""By the Lord Harry,"" shrieked the policeman, as the figure on the"
2153,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"pedestal rose slowly and salaamed, ""it's old Mool Raj himself!"""
2154,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2155,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""My lord!"" faltered Hunumân, ""this is irrelevant--this is contempt of"
2156,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"court."""
2157,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2158,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""Peace! oh Hunumân! and respect the voice of thy parent,"" began the"
2159,THE BLUE MONKEY.,blue monkey.
2160,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2161,THE BLUE MONKEY.,Then a roar of inextinguishable laughter played the mischief with
2162,THE BLUE MONKEY.,majesty.
2163,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2164,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Half an hour afterwards, when Chand Kor in tears was washing the blue"
2165,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"distemper off her lord and master's shrivelled limbs, he repeated his"
2166,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"injunction regarding the fifth commandment to his son, who sat"
2167,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"haranguing on liberty, freedom, public spirit, equality, fraternity,"
2168,THE BLUE MONKEY.,and a host of other duties and privileges.
2169,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2170,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""They are good, my son,"" he said, ""but money is good also, and peace"
2171,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"best of all. Ask no more. I am content, and thou hast naught to do"
2172,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"with it. The temple is, and the blue monkey was mine--at least I was"
2173,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"the blue monkey."""
2174,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2175,THE BLUE MONKEY.,Then Hunumân Sing swore.
2176,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2177,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"That evening the deputy commissioner held a friendly inquiry, and"
2178,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"everybody shook hands all round, excepting Hunumân Sing and his"
2179,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"friend, who left by _ekka_ before the proceedings commenced, vowing"
2180,THE BLUE MONKEY.,vengeance on all summary justice. He was a full-blown pleader before
2181,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"the famous case of ""Mool Raj and a Conch _versus_ Azmutoollah Khan and"
2182,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Others"" came up before the chief court of appeal. On that occasion he"
2183,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"argued most eloquently on various subjects for half an hour, and was"
2184,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"about to resume his seat, covered with perspiration and honour, when a"
2185,THE BLUE MONKEY.,voice from the body of the court cried:
2186,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2187,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"""Respect thy parent, O Hunumân! Remember the things that are behind."""
2188,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2189,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Coiled up neatly on his chair was a blue tail, and once more laughter"
2190,THE BLUE MONKEY.,played the mischief with majesty.
2191,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2192,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"Some people say that was why the appeal was dismissed. Anyhow, it is"
2193,THE BLUE MONKEY.,certain that shortly afterwards Hunumân set up as a pleader in another
2194,THE BLUE MONKEY.,province.
2195,THE BLUE MONKEY.,
2196,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"So Jehâdpore brought up its troopers, and paid or did not pay its"
2197,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"debts in peace. And when Mool Raj died, the folk wagged their heads,"
2198,THE BLUE MONKEY.,"saying, ""Well, he was not much to speak of as a man, but he was a"

2204,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.
2205,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2206,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2207,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"He had no name. The village folk, it is true, called him Baba; but so"
2208,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,they called all such as he. Nor did he ever show that he identified
2209,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,the word as anything more personal than the rest of the strange sounds
2210,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,to which he listened serenely as if he had no part or lot in them.
2211,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"Perhaps he was deaf, perhaps he was dumb. Perhaps he was neither."
2212,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"Nobody knew, nor for the matter of that cared. He was one of Shah"
2213,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"Sujah's mice; no more, no less. In that lay the difference between him"
2214,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,and other men. A small difference in some ways; in others illimitable.
2215,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,To the level of the brows he was as fine a young fellow as you could
2216,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"meet; of middle height, with clean, straight limbs. Above that"
2217,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,nothing--nothing but a skull narrowed to the contours of a new-born
2218,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"babe's, conical, repulsive, like a rat's. Whence the name Shah Sujah's"
2219,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,mouse.
2220,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2221,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"The learned among us call such poor creatures microcephalous, and talk"
2222,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,glibly of joined sutures and osseous formation. The natives of upper
2223,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,India have a different theory. These mouselike ones belong to Shah
2224,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"Sujah's shrine, because they are the firstlings of barren women made"
2225,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"fruitful by the saints' intercession. Therefore, from their birth they"
2226,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"bear the token of the mother's vow, dedicating them to his service."
2227,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,The seal is set on them from the beginning in mute witness to the
2228,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,truth.
2229,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2230,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"Whatever that truth may be; whether, as some say, the new-born babes"
2231,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"brought to be reared, like Samuel in the temple, are born as other"
2232,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"babies, and the typical distortion produced by slow pressure--as in"
2233,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,lesser degree the coveted bomblike foreheads of the Sindhi women are
2234,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"produced--or whether, as others hold, a tradition favourable to the"
2235,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"wealth of the shrine is kept up, and additional gain assured by the"
2236,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"secret exchange, through agents all over India, of the normal babies"
2237,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,for that percentage of microcephalous infants which Nature makes--this
2238,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,much is certain: all children dedicated to Shah Sujah are his mice.
2239,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"There are hundreds of them; growing up at the shrine, dying there, and"
2240,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,during the cold months spreading over the length and breadth of India
2241,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"begging with unvarying success of all women, fruitful and unfruitful;"
2242,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"living meanwhile on the broken food given them, but hoarding the money"
2243,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,with an odd unconsciousness of all save that in some mysterious way it
2244,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"belongs to the saint; then, as the heat returns, wandering back like a"
2245,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"homing pigeon to the insignificant little shrine at Gujrât, which"
2246,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,means so much to so many.
2247,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2248,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"Most of the mice are repulsive; some are more or less deformed, more"
2249,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"or less idiotic, making idiotic noises as they dawdle through the"
2250,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,village alleys carrying their hollow gourds in their outstretched
2251,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"hands. He was not repulsive, and he made no sound of any kind; whether"
2252,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"from inability, or from some lingering consciousness that his sounds"
2253,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"would not be as those he heard, no one knew. In fact, no one knew"
2254,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"anything about him, save that he was a mouse; too naked to be dirty in"
2255,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"that country of canals and tanks, and seemingly quite content with a"
2256,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"beggar's staff and gourd as his only tie to this world. Here to-day,"
2257,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"gone to-morrow, secure of a meal, and of a sand blanket to sleep in if"
2258,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,the nights were cold.
2259,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2260,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,Perhaps he had more sense than others of his kind. Perhaps the theory
2261,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"of deliberate distortion was true, and his fine physique had struggled"
2262,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,against it more successfully than some. But all such things were idle
2263,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"speculations, and there was nothing to be learned even from the big,"
2264,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"luminous eyes, somewhat over-prominent, which looked at everything so"
2265,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"serenely. At the children running out to him with their mother's dole,"
2266,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"at the lean dogs following him in hopes of a scrap, at the birds and"

2394,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"There was no help for it, however; though, just for the sake of"
2395,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"appearances and proprieties, they gave him five whole rupees for the"

2403,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,forgotten all about Shah Sujah's mouse; but only for a time.
2404,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2405,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,At first they thought it nothing but a touch of sun fever from being
2406,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,out all day which made the darling of their hearts so languid. He was
2407,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"down in the heat a little later, too, than was perhaps quite wise, but"
2408,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"those holidays at the end of the month, which would give father the"
2409,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,chance of settling mother and son in the wee house among the Himalayan
2410,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"pines, and of getting a whiff of fresh air himself, had been so"

2412,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2413,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"But a week after, the doctor, summoned from headquarters, looked into"

2415,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"this knowledge, he had to ride back, promising to arrange his work so"
2416,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,as to be there as often as possible. He stood talking in undertones to
2417,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"the native doctor in the veranda before mounting, and the sound of"
2418,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,their voices made the mother shiver. It was soon after this that the
2419,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,little voice began:
2420,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2421,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""O Mummie, he had 'quilth'--lovely, lovely 'quilth.' Whereth he"
2422,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"gone--the 'quilth'--man? I wanth to thee the 'quilth' again.--Dada,"

2424,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2425,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Can't you send for him--somehow?"" She had Sonny in her arms, and the"
2426,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,heat of him struck through to her own breast. Yet she shivered again.
2427,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2428,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"Two days after, when the cot was set out in the veranda for the sake"
2429,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"of the cool evening air, she bent over the child, who lay more languid"
2430,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,than suffering among the toys he liked to see even while he did not
2431,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,care to play with them.
2432,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2433,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Sonny, the 'quilth'-man has come. Dada has brought him."""
2434,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2435,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"Whence, is no matter. The fiat had gone forth, as fiats do go forth."
2436,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"The order had been given to find and, if possible, to bring back one"
2437,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"of Shah Sujah's mice, who had wandered on northward through the"
2438,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"villages. They had found him, and he had returned with them peaceably,"
2439,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"contentedly, serenely."
2440,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2441,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Thath's jolly,"" sighed Sonny. ""Now, Mummie, l'oo'l thee the 'quilth,'"
2442,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"too."""
2443,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2444,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"He wanted to be carried out in those brown arms as before, and"
2445,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"stretched his hands to Shah Sujah's mouse, who stood just as he had"
2446,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"stood before, silent, uncomprehending, incomprehensible--except,"
2447,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"perhaps, to Sonny; but they took him, cot and all, as he lay, across"
2448,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"the petunias, and set him down under one of the great _shisham_-trees,"
2449,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,backed by palms and a wide-spreading banyan. The air was dry and
2450,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,balmy; he was as well there as elsewhere until the dew should begin to
2451,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,fall.
2452,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2453,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Spec'ths l'oo'l flighten them, Mummie; 'quilths' is flightful fings."

2455,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2456,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"So they sat right away, over the petunias once more, upon the veranda"
2457,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"steps, and two pairs of strained, anxious eyes looked at the group"
2458,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"under the trees. The third pair looked also, doubtfully. It was an odd"
2459,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"sight, certainly. The child's soft curls on the pillow, his flushed"
2460,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"cheek seen sidewise, his little hot hands clasped round the bars of"
2461,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"the cot. Beside him, on the grass, like a bronze statue, Shah Sujah's"
2462,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,mouse.
2463,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2464,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Now, manth! if l'oo pleath,"" murmured Sonny. And, as before, he"
2465,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,seemed obedient to the liquid voice. A strange sound indeed! Not a
2466,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"cry, not a whistle. More like the croon of wind through tall"
2467,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"tiger-grass. Scarcely audible, and yet a hush fell on the trees, as if"
2468,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"they stopped to listen. Jack, the fox-terrier, cocked his ears. A"
2469,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"horse neighed from the stables. Then came a rustle, as of leaves."
2470,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2471,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""I know,"" whispered Mummie, touching Dada on the arm. ""He means"
2472,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"squirrels. How stupid of me! Look!"""
2473,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2474,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"Along the branches they came, circling shyly down the trunks, now with"
2475,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"a swift patter, now hanging splayed against the bark, petrified by"
2476,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"curious timidity. Odd little mortals these, with the mark of Great"
2477,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"Ram's fingers on their shining coats, and barred tails a-bristle. Soft"
2478,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"little mortals, not much bigger than a mouse, their round ears cocked,"
2479,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"their bright eyes watchful. Nearer and nearer, by fits and starts,"
2480,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,hopping from distant trees through the short grass as through a
2481,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"thicket, while the croon went on, and Sonny's eyes grew heavy with"
2482,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,sheer satisfaction.
2483,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2484,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Lovely, lovely 'quilth.'--Go on, pleath, manth."""
2485,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2486,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,Nearer and nearer; a dozen or more sitting up with the scattered
2487,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"crumbs in their odd little fingers. Dainty over the feast, nibbling a"
2488,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"bit here and a bit there, and growing fearless, climbing on to the"
2489,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"bronze limbs, looking into the dark, serene eyes."
2490,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2491,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,Sonny's grew heavier and heavier.
2492,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2493,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""I think he is asleep,"" said Dada, indistinctly, through a lump in his"
2494,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,throat. But Mummie could not speak at all.
2495,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2496,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Dew fallin', _mem sahiba_"" remarked the _ayah_, in a dissatisfied"
2497,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"tone. ""Time Sonny baba leave _janowars_ alone."""
2498,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2499,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"It was a slow fever, as it often is with the little ones in India, and"
2500,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,every day for many days Sonny would rouse himself when the sun left
2501,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,the air cooler and ask for his 'quilth.'
2502,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2503,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""It will not hurt him,"" said the doctor, who looked graver at each"
2504,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"visit. ""Our best chance is to keep him going somehow. If you were on"
2505,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"the railway, I'd risk all and have him in the hills to-morrow; but"
2506,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,that long _dhooli_ journey--it is not to be thought of. We must keep
2507,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"him going--keep hold on life as best we can."""
2508,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2509,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,So they used to carry him out under the trees to the quilth and Shah
2510,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,Sujah's mouse. And some sort of a comprehension seemed to come to the
2511,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"_janowars_, as the _ayah_ called them scornfully, of what was required"
2512,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"of them, for day by day the crumbs were scattered nearer the cot, and"
2513,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"day by day the timid courage grew into some new venture, rousing a"
2514,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,languid smile from Sonny.
2515,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2516,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Lovely, lovely 'quilth,'"" he would say, as the bright eyes looked at"
2517,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"him knowingly, and the patter, patter of the little feet came nearer."
2518,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"But the sheer content came quicker and he slept sooner and sooner,"
2519,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,until one day when they were racing over the cot and playing
2520,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"gymnastics with the bars, he made up his mind that there could be"
2521,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"nothing more to wake for, and fell asleep once and for all."
2522,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2523,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Take her away at once,"" said the doctor, as in the early dawn they"
2524,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"drove back without the little coffin on the back seat of the dog-cart,"
2525,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,from the graveyard where Dada had read the service without a break in
2526,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,his voice. There was no lump in his throat now; nothing but an angry
2527,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"despair in his heart. ""Take her away. I telegraphed for you to the"
2528,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"commissioner last night; that will give you three days. Then furlough,"
2529,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"privilege, urgent, private--anything. She must not come back till the"
2530,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,baby is born. And leave the _ayah_ behind--they will get talking of
2531,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"the child."""
2532,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2533,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"That evening, when the servants were being paid off, and certificates"
2534,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"to character written, while the _dhoolies_ waited in the shade where"
2535,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"Sonny's cot had stood the day before, the _ayah_, whimpering but"
2536,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"indignant, asked what was to be done about the _janowar_."
2537,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2538,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""I'll look after that,"" said the doctor, kindly, seeing Dada's look."
2539,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Five rupees, I suppose, and the _tahsildar_ to have him escorted so"
2540,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"far on his way north to the shrine. 'Tis time he were getting back."""
2541,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2542,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,Undoubtedly. Even the last few days had brought the heat. The roses
2543,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"down in the Taleri gardens had dried to _pot-pourri_ as they grew,"
2544,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"smelling almost sweeter than ever. The mangoes grew larger and larger,"
2545,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"and the green parrots clung to them, eating the pulp as it ripened."
2546,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,That was when the gardeners were away turfing a grave in the little
2547,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"enclosure opening out of the garden, and planting red and white"
2548,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"quamoclit to twine up a wooden cross. It did not take long, for the"
2549,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"grave was small. So they came back to frighten the parrots, leaving it"
2550,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"to take care of itself; for the rains came early that year, and after"
2551,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,a time there was no need for watering.
2552,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2553,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"So much rain, that three months after, when Dada, back from leave,"
2554,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"walked through the garden at sunsetting, many of the mango-trees were"
2555,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"ankle-deep in water, and a second crop of roses nodded at their own"
2556,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,reflection in the still pools. But the graveyard stood purposely on
2557,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"higher ground, and its brick wall was backed by a perfect thicket of"
2558,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"date-palms stretching away to the low sand-hills, save on the side"
2559,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,marching with the garden. There oleanders and roses and elephant
2560,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"creeper massed themselves into a hedge, and clambered over the arched"
2561,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"gateway where Dada paused. The doctor was there too, for fever comes"
2562,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"with heavy rain, and the outlying hospitals needed constant"
2563,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"inspection. As the gate swung open, they paused again, not at the"
2564,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"sight within, but at a sound they seemed to recognize. It was a shady"
2565,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"spot. To begin with, great branches swept over it from the garden, and"
2566,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,then in the far corner a huge peepul stood quivering its silver-lined
2567,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"leaves. There lay the little grave, solitary in its square of grass,"
2568,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,for the place was divided into four by two narrow gravel walks ending
2569,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"abruptly at the walls. Two other graves claimed other squares, the"
2570,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"fourth lay vacant. It seemed as if, when that was occupied, the shady"
2571,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,spot would refuse another tenant. Yet there were others even now.
2572,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2573,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Who's that?"" cried the doctor, sharply."
2574,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2575,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"It was Shah Sujah's mouse. He sate propped against the peepul-tree,"
2576,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,and over the grass and the cross of quamoclits the squirrels were
2577,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,chasing each other and playing pranks with the crumbs they were
2578,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"scarcely hungry enough to eat, while the other _janowar_ looked at"
2579,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,them out of hollow serene eyes.
2580,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2581,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"He shifted his gaze to the new-comers, but did not rise. He could not."
2582,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2583,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Good God,"" muttered the doctor, kneeling down beside him, ""the man is"
2584,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"a skeleton, and burning with fever. How the mischief-- Well, the first"
2585,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"thing is to get him moved to hospital."""
2586,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2587,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,When Dada came back with a string bed and four coolies impressed from
2588,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"the garden, he found the doctor looking suspiciously at the crumbs, at"
2589,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,a piece of dough-cake and a bag of money. There were ten whole rupees
2590,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"in it, besides odd coins."
2591,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2592,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""The poor beggar seems starved, and yet he had this and--he was"
2593,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"feeding the squirrels. There's something deuced odd about it all."""
2594,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2595,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"Odd, but simple, especially in the _ayah's_ eyes. ""Master, having given"
2596,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"orders for the _janowar_ to go, the police had naturally taken him"
2597,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"away. He had come back again and begged--naturally, when the _mem"
2598,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"sahiba_ had given him sweet rice every day. But she had given nothing,"
2599,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"nothing at all, except information to the police. Then they had taken"
2600,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"him away again miles and miles, quite close to the highroad to the"
2601,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"shrine, and had bidden him to go home. Even a _janowar_ could have"
2602,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,found his way had he chosen; but the obstinate animal had come back
2603,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,after the sweet rice. So then every one had been told not to give the
2604,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"disobedient one anything to eat. Indeed, it was past time for alms to"
2605,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,Shah Sujah's mice; they should have been back at the shrine with their
2606,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"earnings. To linger was sacrilege, nothing less, especially when the"
2607,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"_Huzoor_ had said he was not wanted any longer. But instead of going,"
2608,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"when he was starved out, as every one imagined, he must have hidden in"
2609,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,the damp garden and got fever. As to what he was doing on the little
2610,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"king of kings' grave, that was mysterious. Perhaps now the master"
2611,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"might believe that _janowars_ were not safe round a sick--"""
2612,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2613,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""_Chuprao_,[9] you fool!"" shouted Dada. As the ayah sidled away, still"
2614,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"indignant, the two men sat and looked at each other."

2623,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2624,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""I'm afraid it's no use,"" said the doctor. ""Starvation and fever are"
2625,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,ill companions; but I'll stay over to-morrow and see what I can do. It
2626,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"is as much my fault as yours, if any one is to blame, but--"""
2627,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2628,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"The doctor, being orthodox, paused."
2629,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2630,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,When they went down on the following evening to see the patient in
2631,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,hospital they found the native assistant volubly apologetic. He had
2632,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"seemed so content, not to say weak, that they had left him alone while"
2633,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,busy over an accident. Half an hour ago they had missed him from his
2634,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"cot. ""Doubtless delirium had supervened with acerbation of fever; but"
2635,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"since peons were out in all directions, by the blessing of God--"""
2636,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2637,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Come on, doctor,"" said Dada, impatiently interrupting the flow of"
2638,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,words.
2639,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2640,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"He was there, face down on the grass, and the squirrels were playing"
2641,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,over his dead body and searching for crumbs.
2642,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2643,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""No!"" said Dada, when the coolies came with a string bed again. ""Bring"
2644,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"a spade or two. I'm going to bury him here."""
2645,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2646,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"The doctor, having religious views, looked doubtful. ""I--I wonder if"
2647,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"it is consecrated ground?"""
2648,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2649,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""I hope to God it is!"" said Dada, fervently."
2650,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2651,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"As they lingered at the gate when the work was over, a squirrel hung"
2652,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"head downward on the peepul-trunk, eying the new-turned earth"
2653,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,suspiciously. Then another with bushy tail erect came hopping
2654,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,fearlessly over the grass--
2655,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2656,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2657,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Cher ip--a pip--pip--pip!"""
2658,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2659,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2660,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,It was a challenge. The next moment they were chasing each other over
2661,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,the cross of quamoclits.
2662,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2663,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,Dada closed the gate softly.
2664,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2665,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"""Lovely, lovely 'quilth,'"" he murmured to himself."
2666,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2667,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,"The lump had come back to his throat, and the doctor gave something"
2668,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,between a laugh and a sob.
2669,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,
2670,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,But they neither of them said anything about the other _janowar_.
2671,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,Perhaps because there was a difficulty in finding an epithet to suit
2672,SHAH SUJAH'S MOUSE.,Shah Sujah's mouse.

2681,I.,I.
2682,I.,
2683,I.,A grove of date-palms; each cluster of carved stems set in its
2684,I.,"feathery crown and base, separated from its neighbours by sandy"
2685,I.,"spaces, where the snakes sunned themselves right in the wayfarer's"
2686,I.,"path. Finding few victims, however; for the _karait_, stretched out"
2687,I.,"like a blue whip-lash, curved back to the prickly cover at the distant"
2688,I.,"step, and though the dusk-coloured vipers tied in true-lovers' knots"
2689,I.,"held their ground, their evil temper gave warning of their presence as"
2690,I.,scale rustled on scale in the angry sliding of the watchful coil.
2691,I.,
2692,I.,"Day and night the sweeping fringes overhead swayed softly, even when"
2693,I.,"no breath stirred the tangle below. But now, when the coming of dawn"
2694,I.,"sent that curious whisper of wind through the world, as if warning it"
2695,I.,"of what the sun may disclose, the leaves tossed their long arms"
2696,I.,wildly.
2697,I.,
2698,I.,A stretch of level land curved inward to the palm-grove; outward till
2699,I.,it merged on the village common with its grey-spined caper-bushes set
2700,I.,"with coral buds. In the distance, shadowy in the half light, was a"
2701,I.,"native town, flat-roofed against the sky. Close at hand an open grave,"
2702,I.,"with a man and woman standing beside it. A queer couple. The old man,"
2703,I.,"dwarfed to distortion, grotesquely ugly; the woman young, straight as"
2704,I.,"a palm, supremely handsome."
2705,I.,
2706,I.,"""Lo, they come, Shâhbâsh!"" she said, in a bold, mellow voice which"
2707,I.,"fitted her appearance. As she shaded her eyes with her hand, the"
2708,I.,coarse madder veil she wore fell from her broad shoulders as if cut in
2709,I.,stone.
2710,I.,
2711,I.,"""_Wah illah!_ Thou hast sight to boast of, Mother Suttu,"" replied her"
2712,I.,"companion. She might have been his daughter in age, but he used the"
2713,I.,title of respect due to all decent women from one not of their own
2714,I.,blood.
2715,I.,
2716,I.,"""Yea, 'tis true,"" she echoed, carelessly. ""The Potter's hand slipped"
2717,I.,"not when he made me. I have naught to bring against him."" It was"
2718,I.,"perhaps a heartless truism, considering her company."
2719,I.,
2720,I.,But then Shâhbâsh was bucklered against bitter thoughts by an
2721,I.,"ingenious theory accounting for his own ill looks. A fairy, he held,"
2722,I.,"had fallen in love with him as a babe, when (as might be augured from"
2723,I.,"his name, which meant 'Well done! Bravo!') he must have been possessed"
2724,I.,of extraordinary beauty. Her jealous determination to keep his
2725,I.,"perfections to herself had attained its object in roundabout fashion,"
2726,I.,by preventing the eyes of others seeing him as he really was. Hence
2727,I.,the distortion lay with them.
2728,I.,
2729,I.,"""I would thine eyes were as sharp for the future as they are for the"
2730,I.,"present,"" he said, thoughtfully, leaning on his adze-like shovel."
2731,I.,
2732,I.,"""'Twere better they were sharp enough to see through dust,"" she"
2733,I.,"answered, smiling broadly into the grave at her feet. ""So thou didst"
2734,I.,"not find it after all, Shâhbâsh."""
2735,I.,
2736,I.,"""Not a cowrie, not a _dumri!_ And I swear 'tis into the tenth dozen of"
2737,I.,graves I have dug--with texts of the holy Koran pouring from me the
2738,I.,"while without stint. Good sound texts, hard as melted solder on a"
2739,I.,"body's teeth. And to no good, except to pave a blessed bed for another"
2740,I.,"sinner. For they pay worse and worse, _mai_ Suttu. When old Feroz"
2741,I.,"Shah buried his son, last week, he left but a rupee's worth of clothes"
2742,I.,on the corpse for perquisite. Look you! If I take not the very
2743,I.,"winding-sheet which decency would leave e'en to the dead, thou and the"
2744,I.,"holy saint yonder will starve--to say naught of servant Shâhbâsh, who"
2745,I.,"needs muscle to sow men in this hard soil."""
2746,I.,
2747,I.,He let his shovel fall on the hard ground to show how it echoed to the
2748,I.,clang.
2749,I.,
2750,I.,"Suttu laughed. ""If dead men do not pay, there are the dates still."
2751,I.,"They will ripen ere long."""
2752,I.,
2753,I.,"""Aye, but how long can they be kept? If the saint dies without"
2754,I.,"speaking, the others will find their tongues. A woman needs gold--or a"
2755,I.,man. Thou wilt have neither unless thou wilt give up the religious vow
2756,I.,"and marry the Kâzi's son. He is willing."""
2757,I.,
2758,I.,Suttu laughed.
2759,I.,
2760,I.,"""So are others that be not pock-marked and one eye to boot."""
2761,I.,
2762,I.,"""_Tobah!_ And thou virtuous and a widow! Lo, he is a man, and beauty"
2763,I.,"is not safe for us. Was not I, Shâhbâsh, the handsomest--"""
2764,I.,
2765,I.,"She interrupted him remorselessly. ""'Tis safe for me, anyhow. The"
2766,I.,grandfather may rouse any day and tell me where the gold is hidden.
2767,I.,"Once it is found, none will covet the graveyard."""
2768,I.,
2769,I.,Shâhbâsh wrinkled his hideous face to an appalling frown.
2770,I.,
2771,I.,"""God knows! If not, then it is a case of digging graves all my life"
2772,I.,till I get over-scant of breath for texts and mattock together. If
2773,I.,"only the sickness would come, 'twould give more chance. For the fox of"
2774,I.,a father-in-law will be claiming shares of treasure with thee if I dig
2775,I.,"aught but graves. Lo! _mai_ Suttu, I tell thee, 'tis ghoul-like work."
2776,I.,"I watch the old folk in the village, and my fingers itch to give them"
2777,I.,a blessed bed in Deen Ali's yard. 'Tis destroying my soul. Thou must
2778,I.,"marry, or I am damned!"""
2779,I.,
2780,I.,"""Sure the fairy will make thee a paradise anywhere,"" laughed Suttu."
2781,I.,"""Lo, they come! Is all prepared? Alms or no alms, Deen Ali's bed must"
2782,I.,"be ready for the faithful. 'Tis in the bond."""
2783,I.,
2784,I.,She spoke with a grave dignity quite apart from her previous manner.
2785,I.,
2786,I.,"""Would God they had put the alms in the bond likewise!"" grumbled the"
2787,I.,dwarf as he slid into the shallow grave to sweep some loosened soil
2788,I.,from the niche hollowed in the hard ground to one side for the
2789,I.,uncoffined tenant. Then he swung himself out again by his brawny arms
2790,I.,and strained his shortsighted eyes toward the advancing procession.
2791,I.,
2792,I.,"""'Tis well,"" he muttered, as a sudden braying of shawms, beating of"
2793,I.,"drums, and skirling of songs rent the still dawn. ""At least they"
2794,I.,remember that the burying of the old is as a bridal. Sure it may be
2795,I.,"better than I feared, and they will not send the decent patriarch back"
2796,I.,"to his friends half naked."""
2797,I.,
2798,I.,"It was an odd funeral. The bier, covered by a tissue-paper canopy,"
2799,I.,swayed as it was borne shoulder-high at a slow trot. The crowd
2800,I.,"laughed and sang. The streamers fluttered, flying round that still,"
2801,I.,muslin-swathed form bound with tinsel. Only Suttu seemed in keeping
2802,I.,"with it, as she stood forward welcoming it to Deen Ali's bed."
2803,I.,
2804,I.,"But the next instant, as she stepped aside to let it pass, a malicious"
2805,I.,look of amusement was on her face as she returned the greeting of a
2806,I.,pock-marked man with one eye.
2807,I.,
2808,I.,"Then, her _rôle_ of hostess being over, she walked away to the"
2809,I.,"date-grove followed by admiring eyes. For Suttu, the _fakeerni_, if"
2810,I.,"somewhat outrageous, was distinctly attractive. That made her vow of"
2811,I.,celibacy all the more unnatural.
2812,I.,
2813,I.,"She sat down on the edge of a back channel of the river, which, after"
2814,I.,"creeping tortuously in a deep, narrow bed, expanded here during the"
2815,I.,"rains to a broad, shallow lake, dotted by clumps of pillared palms,"
2816,I.,beneath whose fringed crowns great bunches of fruit were ripening
2817,I.,fast. Each islet was reflected so clearly in the water that it needed
2818,I.,sharp eyes to see where reality ended and unreality began. Here and
2819,I.,"there, showing where the perennial pools lay beneath the temporary"
2820,I.,"flood, stretched a green carpet of lotus-leaves, where the flowers"
2821,I.,"rose in varying height; the buds, still resting on the water; the"
2822,I.,full-blown flowers flaunting between them and the mace-like stems on
2823,I.,"which the hidden ""jewel in the lotus"" stood disclosed, while the"
2824,I.,"fallen petals floated like shells on the water, or lay piled up in"
2825,I.,"little pink heaps on the green carpet. A faint scent, as of bitter"
2826,I.,"almonds, perfumed the breeze which now and again ruffled the lake and"
2827,I.,"slid a fresh gift of rolling, sparkling water diamonds into the"
2828,I.,"leaf-cups. Beyond this was a golden sunrise, cloudless, serene."
2829,I.,
2830,I.,"Suttu, seated on the edge of grass which grew just as far as the"
2831,I.,"moisture filtered through the sand, and no farther, nodded at the"
2832,I.,scene approvingly. The Potter had made no mistake here either; she
2833,I.,"liked it, liked her own freedom purchased by an easy vow. The idea of"
2834,I.,giving it up in favour of another ten years or more of marriage in a
2835,I.,stifling city quarter was absurd.
2836,I.,
2837,I.,"A kingfisher flashed down into the water like a sapphire, and her"
2838,I.,quick eyes followed it.
2839,I.,
2840,I.,"""_Shâhbâsh!_"" she cried, gleefully, as the bird came up with a bar of"
2841,I.,silver in its purple bill.
2842,I.,
2843,I.,"""'Tis not Shâhbâsh,"" said a voice behind her. ""'Tis I, come to ask--"""
2844,I.,
2845,I.,"She leaped to her feet, confronting the Kâzi's son in real wrath."
2846,I.,
2847,I.,"""So! Will not even death keep thy mind from marriage? Why hast crept"
2848,I.,"here to see me alone? 'Tis not decent--far worse, 'tis not even"
2849,I.,"pleasant. Have I not told thee--aye, and others--that I am a pious"
2850,I.,"widow?"" She drew a corner of her veil across her eyes and hid the"
2851,I.,"suggestion of a smile under the semblance of tears. ""A pious widow"
2852,I.,"vowed to the sonless shrine of my ancestors."""
2853,I.,
2854,I.,The Kâzi's son drew a step nearer.
2855,I.,
2856,I.,"""Thou art too young and too well favoured for a religious. Every one"
2857,I.,"says so,"" he began."
2858,I.,
2859,I.,"""The Lord looks not at beauty, Mir Sahib,"" retorted Suttu, gravely;"
2860,I.,"""and 'tis well for some of us that it is so."""
2861,I.,
2862,I.,"""A sharp weapon is no weapon against enemies, and thou hast enemies."
2863,I.,"My house would protect you. Think! I am the Kâzi's son."""
2864,I.,
2865,I.,"""Lo, why should I forget my lord's merit?"" smiled Suttu, sweetly. ""He"
2866,I.,"has not so many."""
2867,I.,
2868,I.,"He bit his lip. Repartee of that sort he knew, but not from the lips"
2869,I.,of reputable women. The whole affair had the intoxication of an
2870,I.,"intrigue, and its defiance of conventionalities set his pulses"
2871,I.,throbbing.
2872,I.,
2873,I.,"""Listen, O Suttu!"" he said, curbing his passion. ""Hussan, thy dead"
2874,I.,"husband's father, will claim the land when the saint dies, and God"
2875,I.,"knows how the case may go against a woman! Marry me, and I will gain"
2876,I.,"it, were thy father-in-law fifty times over the village accountant."
2877,I.,"Hast heard the saying, 'Only the Kâzi can fight the Putwâri'?"""
2878,I.,
2879,I.,"""Lo, if I came to thy house, there would be fighting enow to fill thy"
2880,I.,"stomach, without going to a neighbour."""
2881,I.,
2882,I.,She drew the coarse veil which she had slipped from her head back to
2883,I.,"its place, with wide-spread arms, as she spoke; and the action"
2884,I.,displayed the full vigour of her finely moulded form. He cursed her
2885,I.,"bigness and boldness inwardly, but schooled himself to another and"
2886,I.,more tender appeal.
2887,I.,
2888,I.,"""Why not, O Suttu? Lo, I am rich, I am young. I--I lie awake o' nights"
2889,I.,"thinking of it. Yea, I swear it! I get no good from my food. I love"
2890,I.,"you. If I died, the very houris in paradise would not tempt me."
2891,I.,
2892,I.,"""But I would make thy grave gladly, Mir sahib, and then may be thou"
2893,I.,"wouldst find rest."""
2894,I.,
2895,I.,"It was too much. He seized her by the wrist and glared at her, every"
2896,I.,"evil instinct roused to fury. ""Then I will buy thee. Thy father-in-law"
2897,I.,"has the right, for the saint is half dead already. Listen! I will buy"
2898,I.,"thee to be my slave. What dost say now?"""

2900,I.,"""That even slaves have naught to do with pockmarks and one eye."" Her"

2903,I.,"""Go!"" she cried, ""or I will make Shâhbâsh yonder strangle thee with"

2906,I.,
2907,I.,"The Kâzi's son, entangled in the trail of his turban, which had fallen"
2908,I.,"off, caught sight of the gravedigger within call, and felt that his"
2909,I.,"chance was over. He stalked away, trying to look dignified as he wound"
2910,I.,"his head-dress on again, but conscious of a suppressed titter behind"
2911,I.,"him, making him grind his teeth and swear vengeance."
2912,I.,
2913,I.,"When he had gone, Suttu sat down again on the grass and slipped her"
2914,I.,hands into the cool water. They tingled unpleasantly.
2915,I.,
2916,I.,"""Yonder beans look ripe,"" she murmured, ""and they would eke out a"
2917,I.,"meal."""
2918,I.,
2919,I.,"Five minutes after, her sleek black head was rising and falling, her"
2920,I.,round arms gleaming in the overhead stroke which sent her straight to
2921,I.,"a lily-field. A couple of moor-hens fled, leaving a rippling streak of"
2922,I.,silver behind them. As she entered the leaf carpet it took in great
2923,I.,waves of water over the edges--waves which broke into dew-drops that
2924,I.,ran races with each other for first place in the leafy hollows.
2925,I.,
2926,I.,"The dragon-flies darted around her, timid but persistent; and myriads"
2927,I.,"of tiny insects, disturbed from the sweet stems, rose in clouds,"
2928,I.,attracting the swift swooping of the bronze-winged fly-catchers.
2929,I.,
2930,I.,"Shâbâsh was waiting for her on the bank as she came back wading, her"
2931,I.,"arms full of blown lotus, her track marked by drifting petals. As she"
2932,I.,approached he flung a few yards of tinsel and muslin on the ground in
2933,I.,"extravagant, theatrical disgust."
2934,I.,
2935,I.,"""That is all,"" he cried; ""by the faith of my fathers, six ells of"
2936,I.,false tinsel and four of twopenny muslin for digging a grave in
2937,I.,_kunker_[10] soil. God and his Prophet! why didst not send them to be
2938,I.,born Hindus? Then 'twould have taken ten rupees of fire-wood to save
2939,I.,"them from being burned in hell. And last night, look you, I cut a"
2940,I.,"sleeping snake in two as I dug, and both ends fell at my toes. _Ari!_"
2941,I.,"A riddle indeed in the dark, which be head and which be tail? And I am"
2942,I.,to go through such moments for six ells of tinsel and four of such
2943,I.,"muslin. No, _mai_ Suttu. 'Tis the Kâzi's son, or starvation."""

2953,I.,Suttu smiled as she stooped to wring the water from her scant
2954,I.,petticoat.
2955,I.,
2956,I.,"""Not so, Shâhbâsh. The Kâzi's son doth not like me. And lotus-beans"

2958,I.,"grave."""
2959,I.,
2960,I.,"He scratched his thick grey hair, on which he wore no turban,"
2961,I.,doubtfully.
2962,I.,
2963,I.,"""God knows! Every full moon I stretch my sheet on the ground and dance"
2964,I.,to please my fairy. Then when I fall into the trance I ask the old
2965,I.,"question, 'Where is Deen Ali's gold?' But there is no answer in the"
2966,I.,"morning. Now, if the fairy cannot tell--"""
2967,I.,
2968,I.,"Suttu laughed. ""Dost not, may be, forget the answer? The black bottle"
2969,I.,"steals thy brains--"""
2970,I.,
2971,I.,"'""Tis not the bottle,"" muttered Shâhbâsh, sulkily, as he gathered up"
2972,I.,"his perquisites. ""'Tis the fairy steals my brains. For sure there be"
2973,I.,"not rum enough in it nowadays--"""
2974,I.,
2975,I.,"So they walked home to the mosque-like tomb in the date-grove, she"
2976,I.,"with her sheaf of lotus, he with his shovel and shroud."
2977,I.,
2978,I.,
2979,I.,
2980,II.,II.
2981,II.,
2982,II.,Suttu's great-great-grandfather had been a saint of the first water--a
2983,II.,"double-distilled, above-proof performer of miracles; his holiness"
2984,II.,being strong enough to stand two generations of dilution and still
2985,II.,leave spiritual distinction to his descendants. Yet the difference in
2986,II.,"the saintship of Deen Ali, the original, and Inâm Ali, the present"
2987,II.,"incumbent of the shrine, lay more in their surroundings than in"
2988,II.,"themselves. The former, according to tradition, had lived for ten"
2989,II.,"years in a trance, oblivious of all save the touch of a certain"
2990,II.,"prayer-carpet on his feet; a carpet brought from holy Mecca, which had"
2991,II.,been used--again according to tradition--by the Prophet himself. Then
2992,II.,"sight, speech, action, were restored to Deen Ali for a space, and"
2993,II.,"while earth and sky wore the glorious apparel of sunrise and sunset,"
2994,II.,his soul came back in praise and prayer.
2995,II.,
2996,II.,"Inâm Ali inherited the trance, but folk called it paralysis, and the"
2997,II.,"death in life yielded to carnal, not spiritual, food. Doubtless"
2998,II.,"physiologically it was quite as wonderful that twice a day, regularly"
2999,II.,"as clock-work, the half-dead organism should accept nourishment;"
3000,II.,practically it was not so impressive.
3001,II.,
3002,II.,But other things had changed too in the seventy-and-odd years since
3003,II.,Deen Ali had planted the Arabian date-stones he had also brought back
3004,II.,from holy Mecca in the land granted to his saintship. Curious holdings
3005,II.,"these, burdened at times by quaint conditions in return for official"
3006,II.,canonization; for in those days saintship paid. In this case the
3007,II.,offerings of the faithful had taken visible shape in the blue-tiled
3008,II.,tomb where Deen Ali's body lay under a stucco roly-poly twelve feet
3009,II.,"long. Whether this length awarded to saintly tombs, which contrasts so"
3010,II.,"oddly with the curtness of those allowed to the laity, has reference"
3011,II.,"to the extent of piety, or whether some Mohammedan exemplar of old"
3012,II.,"really was of unusual stature, is a moot point. Certain it is that in"
3013,II.,"upper India, as elsewhere, the ""unco guid"" are tedious even when at"
3014,II.,rest.
3015,II.,
3016,II.,"The blue-green dome of the saint's tomb, therefore, soared up into the"
3017,II.,"green-grey plumes of the palms, as a record of past munificence; and"
3018,II.,round it the green-blue parrots circled and swept till the wearied eye
3019,II.,sought relief in the gold clusters of dates above and the gold sand
3020,II.,below.
3021,II.,
3022,II.,"Gold! If report said true, golden indeed with other records of"
3023,II.,munificence. But where? That secret lay hid in Inâm Ali's paralyzed
3024,II.,"brain. He must have known; for, despite the slackness of modern"
3025,II.,"offerings, there had never been any want in the mud hovel hitched on"
3026,II.,"to the tomb; until Suttu, coming in one evening with her veil full of"
3027,II.,"dates, had found the old man quite unconscious on the saint's high"
3028,II.,"wooden bed, which still stood over the grave under the dome."
3029,II.,
3030,II.,The news thrilled the adjoining township with brief enthusiasm. Then a
3031,II.,"bustling Hindu assistant surgeon got wind of the case, and sanctity"
3032,II.,"vanished before science. From that day, several years past, matters"
3033,II.,"had gone from bad to worse. A railway appeared, reducing offerings to"
3034,II.,"the lowest ebb; for, as Shâhbâsh declared with mingled truth and"
3035,II.,"tears, the pilgrims counted their third-class return tickets as"
3036,II.,"offerings to the shrine, and the traffic department charged dead"
3037,II.,"against charity in the extortionate fares for sheep, goats, and fowls."
3038,II.,"On the other hand, the railway had certainly brought cholera three"
3039,II.,years in succession--an unheard-of event--and that had increased the
3040,II.,"chances of finding the gold in the digging of graves--graves, however,"
3041,II.,for which the perquisites lessened month by month. That was due to the
3042,II.,village accountant's spite; spite born of family matters which went
3043,II.,back to the time when Suttu was born.
3044,II.,
3045,II.,"Inâm Ali, briefly, had lived for six months in hopes that a posthumous"
3046,II.,child of his only son would be an heir to the saintship; and in his
3047,II.,first disappointment had been only too glad to get rid of mother and
3048,II.,"child, by the former's marriage to the accountant and the latter's"
3049,II.,"betrothal to her stepfather's son. After a time, however, he had"
3050,II.,"bought the child back, with bribes, to keep him company, and"
3051,II.,"thereinafter had spent years in spoiling her. Consequently, when the"
3052,II.,"inevitable fulfilment of the betrothal came round, Suttu was dragged"
3053,II.,"off to _zenana_ life, struggling like a wild animal. She failed,"
3054,II.,"however, to fulfil her duty of bringing a son to inherit, through her,"
3055,II.,"the date-palms and the hidden treasure; and after one baby, born when"
3056,II.,"she was thirteen, ceased its feeble efforts to live, she settled"
3057,II.,"down--well, as a leopardess might settle in its cage."
3058,II.,
3059,II.,"Ten years after, she paid her first visit to the cemetery, in order to"
3060,II.,cool her newly buried husband's grave with decorous tears. She went
3061,II.,"there calmly, and then as calmly refused to return. She had made up"
3062,II.,"her mind to become a religious, she said. Now this fell in with both"
3063,II.,"the old man's and her father-in-law's views. The former was willing,"
3064,II.,"as before, to pay for her companionship; and the latter, with an eye"
3065,II.,"to a future when he should have Suttu entirely under his control,"
3066,II.,thought it as well she should keep in with her grandfather and the
3067,II.,"hidden treasure. So a religious she became, somewhat to the scandal of"
3068,II.,"the neighbourhood. Then came the paralysis, leaving Hussan _minus_ his"
3069,II.,"monthly payment, and quite uncertain whether Suttu said truth when she"
3070,II.,"denied all knowledge of the hoard. In truth, the position was awkward."
3071,II.,"The saint might recover speech, and then, if he found that Suttu had"
3072,II.,"been violently used, he might resent it and make away with the"
3073,II.,"treasure. If, however, by starving her out, Suttu could be induced to"
3074,II.,"break her vow and marry, Hussan could no doubt get himself appointed"
3075,II.,"guardian of the shrine, and so have an opportunity of searching where"
3076,II.,"he chose. The task was not a difficult one, since the people around"
3077,II.,were easily led to believe that her ways and works were anything but
3078,II.,"what a _fakeerni's_ should be. So the offerings grew less and less,"
3079,II.,the complaints of mischance or neglect more frequent; yet still Suttu
3080,II.,"held her head jauntily and laughed when, of an evening, she met her"
3081,II.,father-in-law prowling around the graveyard. It had a fascination for
3082,II.,"him; and often when his feet were not there, his finger was tracing"
3083,II.,"its outline on the village map. There, within that little space, lay"
3084,II.,"the treasure, and a horrible conjunction of a half-dead old man and a"
3085,II.,very much alive young woman prevented him from getting hold of it. The
3086,II.,thought kept him from sleeping when there had been a death in the
3087,II.,"village, and he knew Shâhbâsh was digging and delving. And when he"
3088,II.,"slept he dreamed that the old saint sat up and spoke, but that no one"
3089,II.,could hear a word he said. He did not know that Suttu and her henchman
3090,II.,"had gone the crucial length of spreading the holy carpet Mecca-ways,"
3091,II.,"and setting the old saint's feet upon it, more than once, at sunrising"
3092,II.,and sunsetting. In vain; the miracle would not work for gold; so they
3093,II.,had lifted him back again to the high wooden bed.
3094,II.,
3095,II.,Shâhbâsh was really losing his temper over his part of the business.
3096,II.,"Lotus-beans for breakfast were all very well, but you could not dig"
3097,II.,"graves on lotus-beans. Besides, the black bottle was always empty."
3098,II.,
3099,II.,"""Lo, _mai_, I grow thin,"" he grumbled; ""then the fairy will cease to"
3100,II.,"care for me, and that is an end. Women are not to be trusted."""
3101,II.,
3102,II.,"As he set to work on a baby's grave, he went on grumbling and"
3103,II.,"muttering to himself. He had been her father's foster-brother, and she"
3104,II.,"was the apple of his eye. For all that, he must eat. Some day her"
3105,II.,"enemy would tempt him to treason when he ached with hunger, and who"
3106,II.,could be faithful on an empty stomach? He blubbered at the thought of
3107,II.,his own betrayal.
3108,II.,
3109,II.,"Thus, on the evening of the day when Suttu slapped the Kâzi's son,"
3110,II.,"matters were approaching a crisis all round; even Hussan, prowling"
3111,II.,about the graveyard in the vague disquiet which beset him after every
3112,II.,"fresh excavation of the soil, made up his mind to a bolder game. As he"
3113,II.,"picked his way through the short mud mounds, a sort of thrill shot up"
3114,II.,his legs at the thought that he might be treading on gold; for the
3115,II.,"hope of buried treasure takes possession of men, body and soul. He"
3116,II.,found no one in the reed thatched-hut; but a savory smell of curried
3117,II.,beans from the fire-place showed that its mistress would soon be back
3118,II.,to supper. So he went over to the tomb where the saint lay on the
3119,II.,"wooden bed under the dome, in which the faint breathing of the old man"
3120,II.,swelled to a murmuring echo like a swarm of bees. Hussan stood beside
3121,II.,"the bed, full of rage, malice, and greed. If he could only crack that"
3122,II.,bald old noddle and pick out the kernel!
3123,II.,
3124,II.,Suddenly the thought came that perhaps now--this moment or the
3125,II.,next--was the one appointed from all eternity in which speech would
3126,II.,"return, and he stood petrified by expectation. Perhaps a call might"
3127,II.,rouse the sleeping soul. He started as his own hoarse whisper grew to
3128,II.,"a roar in the echoing dome. That should wake the dead. Then, as the"
3129,II.,"sound died ineffectually to silence, the desire to crack the old man's"
3130,II.,skull at all costs returned. The kernel might take care of itself.
3131,II.,
3132,II.,"Something of this must have showed in his face, for Suttu, coming in"
3133,II.,"behind him, passed softly to the bed and raised a menacing hand. Only"
3134,II.,for an instant. Then she sat down on the edge and laughed.
3135,II.,
3136,II.,"""Well! did he tell you?"""
3137,II.,
3138,II.,A brutal question; for the answer would be dinned into his ears by the
3139,II.,"echo, and he knew it all too well already."
3140,II.,
3141,II.,"""Come outside, daughter,"" he said, with a curse; ""one cannot hear"
3142,II.,"one's self speak in this chattering place."""
3143,II.,
3144,II.,They sat down on the topmost step of the low flight leading to the
3145,II.,"tomb. The heat of the sun was over, but a scorching air struck up from"
3146,II.,"the bricks, making Suttu fan herself with the corner of her veil. No"
3147,II.,"wonder men coveted her, thought her companion, eying her askance. She"
3148,II.,grew handsomer every day.
3149,II.,
3150,II.,"""Suttu,"" he began, taking the plunge boldly, ""peace is better than"
3151,II.,"war. Give me half the gold, and I am content. Let it stay in the"
3152,II.,"family, Suttu."""
3153,II.,
3154,II.,"""Whose family--mine or thine?"" she asked, scornfully."
3155,II.,
3156,II.,"""'Tis the same. Lo, is not Murghub thy brother, since he is thy"
3157,II.,"mother's son, though he be but a poor natural?"""
3158,II.,
3159,II.,"""Lay not that to her charge,"" retorted Suttu, flippantly. ""She made no"
3160,II.,"mistake in me."""
3161,II.,
3162,II.,"Hussan coughed down his impatience. ""Well, well, I care not. I came"
3163,II.,"not to chop words. It is the gold, Suttu! I mean to have some of it."""
3164,II.,
3165,II.,"""What gold? I know of none. I have seen none."""
3166,II.,
3167,II.,"""Then have I! See!"" He felt in an innermost pocket, and showed her,"
3168,II.,"lying in his palm, a broad gold-piece. ""They make not such pieces"
3169,II.,"nowadays. Where that came from there are more."""
3170,II.,
3171,II.,"She turned it over and over in her long, brown fingers. ""Aye, 'tis"
3172,II.,"old. Didst steal it from him, then?"" A backward toss of the head"
3173,II.,indicated her meaning.
3174,II.,
3175,II.,"""Nay, he gave it."""
3176,II.,
3177,II.,"""Wherefore?"""
3178,II.,
3179,II.,"""For thee, Suttu, when thou wast a child. Give it me back. Stop! what"
3180,II.,"dost thou?"""
3181,II.,
3182,II.,"""This,"" she cried, shrilly, seizing his clutching hand by the wrist"
3183,II.,"in a grasp firm as a man's, while in sheer bravado she held the coin"
3184,II.,"high above her head. ""I will give it back to the old man, and see"
3185,II.,what he thinks of thee for keeping it. What! wouldst fight for one
3186,II.,"gold-piece, fool, and lose the chance of lakhs by my death? Yea, yea,"
3187,II.,"I know. Thou art not my heir in death, though thou mayst have hold on"
3188,II.,"me alive. Hands off, or I will fight too! And Shâhbâsh comes to his"
3189,II.,"supper. He is a devil when hungry!"""
3190,II.,
3191,II.,"Her tone was still mocking, the grasp on his wrist firm but not"
3192,II.,"straining. Her temper in control as yet, but she meant mischief, if"
3193,II.,mischief was to be; and for the life of him Hussan could not help
3194,II.,admiring her.
3195,II.,
3196,II.,"""Thou art a she-devil,"" he said, sulkily--""a she-devil, and no woman."""
3197,II.,
3198,II.,"""I bore a son to your son, anyhow,"" she retorted quickly, and her"
3199,II.,frown warned him that he had gone too far.
3200,II.,
3201,II.,"""If thou wilt but listen--"""
3202,II.,
3203,II.,"""Not till I have laid this offering in the saint's hand,"" she"
3204,II.,"interrupted imperially, with a gesture of disdain. Hussan kicked his"
3205,II.,heels savagely as she marched over the platform and entered the tomb.
3206,II.,He could see her stoop and lay the coin in the indifferent palm
3207,II.,resting beside the still body. She came back much the better for this
3208,II.,"serio-comic interlude, for her dramatic instincts were strong, and she"
3209,II.,played her part of independence vigorously.
3210,II.,
3211,II.,"""Well,"" she began, quite graciously, settling herself down on the step"
3212,II.,"beside her father-in-law, ""if peace be better than war, what price"
3213,II.,"hath peace?"""
3214,II.,
3215,II.,"The accountant leaned over to her eagerly. ""Halves--halves in"
3216,II.,"everything save liberty. That is all thine own."""
3217,II.,
3218,II.,For an instant she felt tempted. Then her natural waywardness
3219,II.,returned.
3220,II.,
3221,II.,"""And if I claim the whole?"""
3222,II.,
3223,II.,"""War! And that to a woman without gold--"""
3224,II.,
3225,II.,"She gave an irritating chuckle. ""Bah! It may come any day. Shâhbâsh"
3226,II.,"may find it; the old man may speak."""
3227,II.,
3228,II.,"The very possibility of her words being true roused his anger. ""Speak!"
3229,II.,"He will never speak again."""
3230,II.,
3231,II.,A rattle behind made them both turn with the alertness of those who
3232,II.,live among snakes. Suttu was on her feet in a second without a cry.
3233,II.,"The accountant let loose a yell of dismay, and in his recoil rolled"
3234,II.,"back a step or two, where he lay clutching at the bricks wildly. For"
3235,II.,the old saint was sitting up on his bed waggling his bald head over
3236,II.,the coin; he could not have looked more ghastly had he risen from the
3237,II.,dead.
3238,II.,
3239,II.,The great moment was upon them!
3240,II.,
3241,II.,This thought came first to both spectators; and they were too
3242,II.,uncultured to conceal it.
3243,II.,
3244,II.,"""Tell us where!"" cried Suttu, as she stood."
3245,II.,
3246,II.,"""Yea, tell us ere you die!"" echoed the accountant as he lay."
3247,II.,
3248,II.,"Not a very warm welcome back to life, but the old man, though he"
3249,II.,"raised his head at the cry, understood nothing. The dim eyes passed"
3250,II.,the covetous faces and rested on the familiar landscape darkening
3251,II.,beyond the door of his tomb. Then the nerveless hand slipped from its
3252,II.,"resting-place on his knee--slipped, slipped, till with a clink, and a"
3253,II.,"roll, and a rattle, given back a thousand-fold by the dome, the coin"
3254,II.,fell upon the stone floor.
3255,II.,
3256,II.,"""Gone!"" he whispered, ""gone--yea, gone forever!"""
3257,II.,
3258,II.,But the look of life in his face had carried Suttu back to her
3259,II.,"childhood, and her arms were already round the failing figure, as she"
3260,II.,turned such fierce forbidding on her companion that he shrank back
3261,II.,silent.
3262,II.,
3263,II.,"""It is the last chance!"" he whispered, after a time."
3264,II.,
3265,II.,"""I care not."""
3266,II.,
3267,II.,Suddenly the bald head fell back on Suttu's breast.
3268,II.,
3269,II.,The chance was over.
3270,II.,
3271,II.,"They sat all through the night waiting for a sign, and none came."
3272,II.,"Before the dawn broke, the old saint and his secret had gone together"
3273,II.,into the darkness.
3274,II.,
3275,II.,"Hussan, as he walked cityward, felt that Fate had done him a good as"
3276,II.,"well as an ill turn. He had made no compact with Suttu, and, now that"
3277,II.,"the grandfather was out of the way, he could sue for guardianship at"
3278,II.,"once, and unmask a battery he had been keeping in reserve."
3279,II.,
3280,II.,"And Shâhbâsh, disconsolate over the cold curry he had actually"
3281,II.,forgotten to eat in the hope of hearing his old master speak once
3282,II.,"more, made gruesome faces over his coming task. The gold, for sure,"
3283,II.,"was not hidden under Deen Ali's roly-poly, so he would have to find a"
3284,II.,resting-place in it for the last incumbent without greed of gain to
3285,II.,beguile his labour.
3286,II.,
3287,II.,"Only Suttu did not think of the future, but of the past, when the old"
3288,II.,man had been her willing slave.
3289,II.,
3290,II.,
3291,II.,
3292,III.,III.
3293,III.,
3294,III.,The dates were ripe. Great drooping bunches of them hung under the
3295,III.,"swaying palm-leaves--rose-pink and purple-black, yellow and brown,"
3296,III.,many-tinted like some rare agate. Shâhbâsh gorged himself on the
3297,III.,"sickly-sweet fruit, and every one, far and near, grew visibly fatter."
3298,III.,"But Deen Ali's Arabian dates were too valuable for home consumption,"
3299,III.,and Suttu only awaited the new moon in order to summon the pluckers
3300,III.,"and driers to prepare the fruit for market. Shâhbâsh, with a sigh at"
3301,III.,"the shortness of opportunity, ate all the more and thought of little"
3302,III.,else.
3303,III.,
3304,III.,Yet the four weeks since the saint's death had not been uneventful.
3305,III.,The Kâzi's son and the accountant had joined issue in their desire to
3306,III.,"see Suttu worsted. As yet, however, there had been no overt act. To"
3307,III.,"begin with, the native of India does nothing in a hurry. In addition,"
3308,III.,none gauges better than he the indisputable advantage of an old lie
3309,III.,over a new one. It is like port wine depositing a crust for itself out
3310,III.,"of its own sediment. Finally, even a false claim acquires dignity by"
3311,III.,"being preferred deliberately, moderately. All these considerations had"
3312,III.,coincided towards inaction--as yet.
3313,III.,
3314,III.,"But a day or two before the new moon matters changed. Suttu, coming at"
3315,III.,"dawn from her hut, saw a sight which literally took her breath away."
3316,III.,Three of the tallest stems in the nearest clump of palms were swaying
3317,III.,under the weight of men clinging to them by clamps and a rope passed
3318,III.,"round their waists. Below, the freshly gathered fruit lay in heaps"
3319,III.,under the fingers of women busy in sorting it and carrying it in
3320,III.,baskets to a drying enclosure already fenced in by hedges of plaited
3321,III.,"leaves. In a word, date-picking was in full swing. Had she by chance"
3322,III.,given the orders in her sleep?
3323,III.,
3324,III.,"Incredulous of her own sight, she roused Shâhbâsh, who still lay"
3325,III.,snoring on the raised platform of the tomb.
3326,III.,
3327,III.,"He was on his feet in a moment, and shouting ""Thieves!"" loudly as the"
3328,III.,"only explanation, swung himself down like a monkey, and ran"
3329,III.,"gesticulating with windmill arms towards the trees. His ugliness, even"
3330,III.,"when familiar, was phenomenal; seen by the date-pickers, who as usual"
3331,III.,"were strangers employed by a big contractor, it appeared supernatural;"
3332,III.,"and the women, taking him to be nothing more nor less than the demon"
3333,III.,"in charge of the grove, flung down their baskets and fled, screaming."
3334,III.,"The men would doubtless have followed their example, had it been"
3335,III.,"possible; but, rather than run the gantlet of the dancing, yelling"
3336,III.,"creature below, they dug their clamps tighter and held on in mortal"
3337,III.,terror of what would happen next.
3338,III.,
3339,III.,Suttu's more tardy appearance led to an explanation; from which it
3340,III.,"appeared that the pickers had been sent by a contractor, who had"
3341,III.,formally bought the crop from one Hussan the accountant.
3342,III.,
3343,III.,"""Leave them to me, _mai_ Suttu!"" shrieked Shâhbâsh, in an ecstasy of"
3344,III.,"rage over this calm appropriation. ""Lo, I will give them a crop of"
3345,III.,"blows if they come down. If not, let them starve and drop like bats in"
3346,III.,"the cold. I am in no hurry."" He squatted himself on the matting and"
3347,III.,helped himself to the gathered dates with both hands. But Suttu saw
3348,III.,"further than the immediate present, and knew a protest must be raised,"
3349,III.,and that quickly. She turned at once to that confidence in the power
3350,III.,"of personal appeal which, thank Heaven, still lingers in India,"
3351,III.,despite Western attempts to strangle it with red tape and smother it
3352,III.,with sealing-wax.
3353,III.,
3354,III.,"""Yea, watch thou,"" she cried, ""while I go to the big _sahib's_ house"
3355,III.,"and cry for justice. He listens to the poor."""
3356,III.,
3357,III.,"""_Wâh! wâh!_"" assented the clingers, ""but see us safe first, O"
3358,III.,"mother!"""
3359,III.,
3360,III.,"""Let them be,"" said Shâhbâsh, confidentially, ""else they may make away"
3361,III.,"with the dates they have picked. Lo, they are safer there till the"
3362,III.,"police come."""
3363,III.,
3364,III.,"So there they clung, while the _fakeerni_, her indignation increasing"
3365,III.,"at every swinging stride, made her way to the deputy-commissioner's"
3366,III.,bungalow.
3367,III.,
3368,III.,"He was a small, fair English lad, put in charge--with many"
3369,III.,instructions to telegraph to headquarters if he saw signs of the
3370,III.,millennium or another mutiny--during the absence on three weeks' leave
3371,III.,of a senior man. He was just mounting his polo pony in order to keep
3372,III.,"his hand in by chivying a ball round a stick, when wronged womanhood"
3373,III.,appeared and flung out a pair of remarkably beautiful arms for
3374,III.,justice. Perhaps the fact that the complainant was superbly handsome
3375,III.,and struck a most impressive attitude had something to do with the
3376,III.,readiness with which he turned to the red-coated orderlies for a
3377,III.,translation of her _patois_ petition.
3378,III.,
3379,III.,"""'Tis Suttu, the _fakeerni_, and she comes to tell the Protector of"
3380,III.,"the Poor that contractors are feloniously picking her dates."""
3381,III.,
3382,III.,"""Send and stop 'em. And, and--what the deuce is the right thing to do."
3383,III.,"Oh, yes. Tell the police to report as usual."" Then, as he rode off, he"
3384,III.,"nodded affably to Suttu. ""Take comfort, mother; I'll see to it."""
3385,III.,
3386,III.,"He had been swished at Harrow quite an incredibly short time before,"
3387,III.,"but he did the part of Providence neatly, while men for whom he had"
3388,III.,fagged were enjoying the inestimable privilege of sitting on a
3389,III.,vestry--or the knife-board of an omnibus conveying them citywards to
3390,III.,act as copying-machines for the term of their natural lives.
3391,III.,
3392,III.,"Suttu's apparent triumph, however, dwindled in Shâhbâsh's eyes to"
3393,III.,ignominious defeat when the police refused permission for any one to
3394,III.,pick the dates until the petition of Hussan for the land on behalf of
3395,III.,his son Murghub should be decided.
3396,III.,
3397,III.,"""What has that idiot to do with my land?"" cried the _fakeerni_,"
3398,III.,"indignantly. ""Lo, there is no drop of saint's blood in him. He is of"
3399,III.,"the second marriage."""
3400,III.,
3401,III.,"The policeman sniggered. ""I know not, mother! But this I hear, that"
3402,III.,"Hussan saith otherwise, and the Kâzi is with him. And births and"
3403,III.,"marriages are ticklish things to date, if the Kâzi be not friendly."""
3404,III.,
3405,III.,"Suttu's heart throbbed. If the Kâzi were indeed her only refuge, she"
3406,III.,might have to face the storm in the open.
3407,III.,
3408,III.,"""O thou with the yellow trousers on thy legs, and wisdom in head and"
3409,III.,"heart,"" moaned Shâhbâsh, ""dost mean that these dates--Deen Ali's"
3410,III.,"famous dates--are to be food for parrots? while I----"" He sat in the"
3411,III.,"sand, clasping his stomach, rocking backwards and forwards, a"
3412,III.,ludicrous spectacle of woe; yet there was tragedy in the comedy.
3413,III.,
3414,III.,"That evening, when supper consisted of a few millet-cakes and a tray"
3415,III.,"of watery _pilu_-berries, which Suttu had gathered from the jungles,"
3416,III.,he looked at the ripe dates overhead and felt that the hour of
3417,III.,apostasy had come. After the barmecidal feast he took his mattock and
3418,III.,"went to the graveyard--not to dig, but solemnly to consider which of"
3419,III.,Suttu's two enemies should have his services. Dawn found him returning
3420,III.,"from the Kâzi's house, with the black bottle full of rum, and the"
3421,III.,remains of a perfect feast of _bakkar khana_ tied up in a
3422,III.,handkerchief--both of which he hid carefully. All that day he did
3423,III.,nothing but vaunt the delights of a sheltered home combined with rich
3424,III.,food; especially to a woman--more especially to a woman who had
3425,III.,nothing to eat but _pilu_-berries and millet cakes! Suttu smiled at
3426,III.,him indulgently.
3427,III.,
3428,III.,"""Lo, God did not make me all stomach,"" she said. ""I eat the air and"
3429,III.,the sunshine; and I like to see the parrot people and the squirrel
3430,III.,"people eat my dates, even if I can't."""
3431,III.,
3432,III.,"Shâhbâsh gave a rumble of despair, and bolstered up his uneasy"
3433,III.,"conscience by telling himself such views were unnatural, accursed."
3434,III.,
3435,III.,"""Is a grave ordered?"" asked Suttu, in surprise, when, that evening"
3436,III.,"after supper, the dwarf shouldered his mattock. ""Who is dead?"""
3437,III.,
3438,III.,"""The saddler's son. Leastways he was so nigh his end to-day that his"
3439,III.,people gave me warning it might be wanted. And like as not they would
3440,III.,"eat oaths had it been bespoke in form, for they are keen to quarrel."
3441,III.,"Aye, aye, if lies were satisfying, my belly wouldn't be empty."""
3442,III.,
3443,III.,"He disappeared into the soft, balmy darkness, grumbling and"
3444,III.,muttering--to come back circuitously to the hiding-place of the black
3445,III.,"bottle. He would need that for consolation, aye, for forgetfulness,"
3446,III.,before midnight brought the bribed watchmen to guard the date-grove.
3447,III.,"Then sooner or later after that some one's cries---- Well, why not?"
3448,III.,Suttu would not be the first woman who had been carried off to a rich
3449,III.,"marriage, and had lived to tell the tale cheerfully. Still, the"
3450,III.,thought of those cries when the Kâzi and his friends came was
3451,III.,disturbing. Shâhbâsh took a great pull at the bottle. It would bring
3452,III.,"the fairy, and the fairy was unfailing consolation."
3453,III.,
3454,III.,"Meanwhile Suttu sat on the steps of the tomb, too much disturbed, by"
3455,III.,"this outrageous claim of Hussan's, for sleep. The grounds which he"
3456,III.,would put forward were easy to guess. He and the Kâzi would post-date
3457,III.,"the second marriage, and ante-date Murghub, the idiot's birth, so as"
3458,III.,"to make him out her full brother. Besides, they had money for"
3459,III.,"evidence; she had none, and the neighbours were unfriendly. Her only"
3460,III.,"help lay in the Lord, and that, she knew, had nothing to do with a"
3461,III.,"court of justice. Still, it was as well to omit nothing which might be"
3462,III.,"of use; so she brought out the trestle-shaped stool, on which her"
3463,III.,"grandfather's copy of the Koran lay, and began to chant an additional"
3464,III.,chapter of Holy Writ as a kind of bribe to favour. As she rocked
3465,III.,"herself backward and forward, her lips busy with the long rhythm in"
3466,III.,"which the unknown words quite lost all identity, her mind was busy"
3467,III.,over the time when she had learned it all with tears and trouble from
3468,III.,"the saint, stern on this one point. How fond he had been of"
3469,III.,divinations!--and Suttu paused in the middle of a pious apothegm to
3470,III.,recollections of her grandfather compiling date-names for his
3471,III.,"neighbours--names, that is to say, which by the values of the"
3472,III.,"composing letters would give the date of birth. What if her own name,"
3473,III.,"Sutara Begum, was one of these, and the idiot's also? That would be"
3474,III.,"proof indeed! Perhaps Shâhbâsh---- She had started to her feet, when"
3475,III.,"she remembered her chapter, in some trepidation, since half a bribe"
3476,III.,was no bribe. She would just go on chanting till Shâhbâsh came home.
3477,III.,"It could do no harm, and might do good. Her round, full voice echoed"
3478,III.,"back from the tomb, and out into the date-palms."
3479,III.,
3480,III.,"""_Wâh!_ if she were really, after all, a pious one, and not a bad"
3481,III.,"walker,"" said one of the watchers to the other. His companion clucked"
3482,III.,"a denial. ""_Thchu!_ 'tis likely she knows the Kâzi is to be here"
3483,III.,"to-night. That is woman's way."""
3484,III.,
3485,III.,Suttu chanted and chanted till she grew hoarse. Then she stood up and
3486,III.,listened. The night was still and silent. Not even the distant thud of
3487,III.,"the mattock, so Shâhbâsh must be on his way back. She waited with the"
3488,III.,"little oil-lamp in her hand, eager for her question. Then impatience"
3489,III.,"gained the mastery, and still with the oil-cresset in her hand--for"
3490,III.,"the new moon gave little light, and snakes were common--she set off"
3491,III.,swiftly through the palms towards the cemetery.
3492,III.,
3493,III.,"""Shâhbâsh!"" she cried, but nothing stirred or answered as she picked"
3494,III.,her way through the short graves. Suddenly she was brought up sharply
3495,III.,by something at her feet--something she had deemed another grave. It
3496,III.,was the dwarf stretched fast asleep on a white sheet. His grey hair
3497,III.,"was twined with jasmine blossoms, and a black bottle lay empty by his"
3498,III.,side. He had been dancing to amuse his fairy. That was no uncommon
3499,III.,"affair; but whence had he got the inspiration, and the greasy remnants"
3500,III.,of a feast which the light of the lamp disclosed? What villainy had he
3501,III.,"been bribed to commit? Something, she felt sure, even if it were"
3502,III.,nothing more serious than a failure to fulfil the duties of her
3503,III.,"freehold, by having Deen Ali's bed ready for the saddler's son. If it"
3504,III.,"were that! She seized the shovel, and swinging it over her head"
3505,III.,"brought it down on the ground, where Shâhbâsh had outlined a grave,"
3506,III.,"with a thud which set her arms tingling. The soil was hard, indeed,"
3507,III.,and surely that was twelve o'clock chiming from the court gong! Not
3508,III.,much time left; but softer spots were to be found than the one
3509,III.,Shâhbâsh had chosen. She took up the oil-cresset again and wandered
3510,III.,round to the extreme edge of the graveyard where it merged into the
3511,III.,sandier common.
3512,III.,
3513,III.,Thud! thud! The strokes of the mattock echoing through the night made
3514,III.,"the Kâzi's son smile as, about an hour after midnight, he crept alone"
3515,III.,to the tomb. A man who is the prey of a purely animal passion does not
3516,III.,"have his ears boxed for nothing, and his idea of revenge went further"
3517,III.,"than marriage. No one would heed Suttu's cries for help this time, and"
3518,III.,the watchers were in his pay.
3519,III.,
3520,III.,Thud! thud! Suttu's respect for her henchman increased at every
3521,III.,"stroke. She was well into the grave by this time, digging round and"
3522,III.,"round methodically, though she ached all over. Yet, if she died of it,"
3523,III.,that grave should be ready. What was that? Metal on metal! The
3524,III.,surprise sent a tingle all through her. Then she was down on hands and
3525,III.,"knees, groping in the loosened soil."
3526,III.,
3527,III.,"Yes, it was the treasure at last, and no one, no soul alive, except"
3528,III.,"herself, must know of it. She looked round hastily into the darkness"
3529,III.,and silence. There was no fear of interruption now; there might be
3530,III.,"afterwards. Her best plan was to finish the grave, so as to obliterate"
3531,III.,"all trace of the spot whence she had taken that heavy brass pot, and"
3532,III.,"then, but not till then, to go home quietly. The next instant the thud"
3533,III.,"of the mattock began again. A lucky decision; for the Kâzi's son,"
3534,III.,"surprised at finding Suttu absent, was beginning to suspect treachery"
3535,III.,"from the silence, when the digging recommenced. Shâhbâsh, then, meant"
3536,III.,"to keep faith, and not seek safety in flight. But Suttu? As the"
3537,III.,spoiler sat beside the friendly watchman he asked himself if the lies
3538,III.,"he himself had circulated so diligently about the religious were true,"
3539,III.,and she had an assignation elsewhere. He gnashed his teeth over the
3540,III.,thought and his own rejection.
3541,III.,
3542,III.,"""A step, my lord! it was a step!"" whispered one of the guardians, and"
3543,III.,"the Kâzi's son crept towards the hut. He had not entered it before,"
3544,III.,"being assured it was empty; but now, thinking Suttu might have seen"
3545,III.,"him and slipped into the darkness for safety, he felt his way through"
3546,III.,the door and so on by the wall.
3547,III.,
3548,III.,Then a yell burst from him--a cry once heard never to be forgotten:
3549,III.,
3550,III.,"""Snake! snake!"""
3551,III.,
3552,III.,"The watchmen heard it and came slowly, feeling their dark way with"
3553,III.,"sticks, lest where one snake was there might be two. Suttu heard it"
3554,III.,"also, and, lamp in hand, ran back to the hut, knowing that friend or"
3555,III.,foe was in deadly peril.
3556,III.,
3557,III.,"Something huddled up, writhing, moaning, clasping one hand with the"
3558,III.,"other, shapeless, convulsed by fear, lay upon the ground--something"
3559,III.,that flung itself before her and yelled for a charm--the saint's
3560,III.,charm--for mercy--for help--for anything.
3561,III.,
3562,III.,"""Thou!"" she cried, ""thou! What dost here?"""
3563,III.,
3564,III.,"She knew well enough, and she thrust him back savagely."
3565,III.,
3566,III.,"""Never mind that now, mother,"" whimpered one of the men. ""Give him the"
3567,III.,"charm. Sure God gave such to the saints for all men, and all men are"
3568,III.,"sinners."""
3569,III.,
3570,III.,"""For men--not for dogs! Go, hound--go and die! I have no charm for"
3571,III.,"thee."""
3572,III.,
3573,III.,"The wretched creature, struggling from the hands of the watchmen, who"
3574,III.,"strove to set him on his feet, caught her by the ankle. ""Save me! save"
3575,III.,"me, to be thy friend! I know--I can save--I--"""
3576,III.,
3577,III.,"He sank down helpless, foaming at the mouth from abject fear."
3578,III.,
3579,III.,Suttu paused. There was something in that view of the case. If
3580,III.,"anything could be done, if by chance-- By the light of the lamp she"
3581,III.,"examined the bitten finger closely, and an odd look came to her face."
3582,III.,
3583,III.,"""It was near the door, breast-high by the sticks of the thatch thou"
3584,III.,"wast bitten,"" she said, as she hastily concealed the wound under a"
3585,III.,bandage.
3586,III.,
3587,III.,"""Yea, yea, thou knowest! The charm, mother Suttu, the charm! I swear"
3588,III.,"to be thy friend!"""
3589,III.,
3590,III.,"The _fakeerni_ looked contemptuously at her writhing lover. ""Swear by"
3591,III.,"thy son's head, fool! naught else will satisfy me!"""
3592,III.,
3593,III.,"When the only oath a native will not break had been pronounced, Suttu"
3594,III.,stood up with a laugh.
3595,III.,
3596,III.,"""The charm is worked, Mir Sahib. Thou wilt not die of that bite."" Then"
3597,III.,"she checked herself, and with the same odd look on her face assumed a"
3598,III.,"graver tone. ""Lo, I will work the charm. As for thee--go home, swift"
3599,III.,"as thou canst. Call the barber, let him bleed thee to faintness. Take"
3600,III.,"_kâla dâna_[11] and sulphur to the full. Eat naught for two days, live"
3601,III.,"righteous, and look not on the bite for a month. Then give a hundred"
3602,III.,"rupees to the saint's shrine."""
3603,III.,

3605,III.,---------------------
3606,III.,

3609,III.,---------------------
3610,III.,
3611,III.,
3612,III.,"""'Tis all right, master,"" whispered one of the men. ""There is no fear"
3613,III.,"of the bargain when payment follows cure. Lo, thou art better already,"
3614,III.,"and by this thou shouldst have been worse, had not the charm worked."
3615,III.,"Hurry, hurry, lest harm come from disobedience!"""
3616,III.,
3617,III.,"When they were quite out of sight and hearing, Suttu took the lamp,"
3618,III.,went to the door of the hut and chirruped. From a hole in the wall a
3619,III.,pair of bright eyes looked out.
3620,III.,
3621,III.,"""The Brahmans say true,"" she chuckled, ""and Ram befriends those who"
3622,III.,befriend his favourite. Shâhbâsh would have had me tear the squirrel's
3623,III.,"nest down, but I love the chattering things."""
3624,III.,
3625,III.,"She had little time, however, to spare for amusement at her own trick."
3626,III.,"The grave had to be completed, the treasure brought home by dawn. Her"
3627,III.,"arms ached worse than ever from their short rest, and there was a grey"
3628,III.,"glimmer in the east, before she judged that her work would pass"
3629,III.,muster. Then she removed all Shâhbâsh's belongings to the side of the
3630,III.,"grave, leaving him still in a drunken sleep upon the bare ground."
3631,III.,
3632,III.,"Finally, lifting the brass pot, which was carefully luted over with"
3633,III.,"hard clay, she carried it to the hut, shut the door, and by the"
3634,III.,growing light through the chinks began to open up her treasure.
3635,III.,
3636,III.,The pot was full of farthings--nothing but farthings. She sat and
3637,III.,looked at them hopelessly. What did it mean? Why should any one take
3638,III.,"the trouble to bury farthings? The puzzle was beyond her, and when a"
3639,III.,"gleam of real sun warned her that time was passing, she hid the pot"
3640,III.,"under a pile of brushwood, and stepped out with a feeling of relief"
3641,III.,"into the open air. The world was ablaze with the clear, uncompromising"
3642,III.,light of an Indian morning. The parrots were wheeling round the blue
3643,III.,"dome, and a squirrel sat on the top of the thatch chirping over a date"
3644,III.,stolen from the disputed crop.
3645,III.,
3646,III.,"Suttu thought of the Kâzi's son physicked, bled, and hungry. Her laugh"
3647,III.,"echoed out among the palms, and she felt more comforted than when, the"
3648,III.,"night before, she had sought solace in chanting."
3649,III.,
3650,III.,
3651,III.,
3652,IV.,IV.
3653,IV.,
3654,IV.,Shâhbâsh sat up and opened his mouth with a tremendous yawn. Then he
3655,IV.,"opened his eyes, and at the same moment reached around for the black"
3656,IV.,"bottle. Its absence woke him thoroughly, and the further discovery"
3657,IV.,"that he was on the bare ground made him instinctively cry ""Thieves!"""
3658,IV.,before he was alert enough to notice the sight of his belongings on
3659,IV.,"the ground some little way off. Rising slowly, for he was stiff in his"
3660,IV.,"limbs, he stumbled towards them, conscious only of a racking headache."
3661,IV.,"Memory of his own treachery had not yet returned, and when he all but"
3662,IV.,"fell into a new-made grave on his way to the black bottle, his mind"
3663,IV.,"seemed to him a perfect blank, and he stood transfigured before this"
3664,IV.,evidence of an industry which he could not remember. He sat down
3665,IV.,"helplessly on its edge, dangling his legs over the side, and peered"
3666,IV.,"into it critically. Without doubt, if that was his handiwork, he must"
3667,IV.,have been very drunk indeed. The mere force of habit made him slip
3668,IV.,"into it, and, seizing the mattock, begin to trim the shape. Suddenly"
3669,IV.,"he gave a yell, and the next moment was up on solid earth again,"
3670,IV.,clutching at something which had rolled out of the last spadeful of
3671,IV.,earth--something which had clinked and glittered.
3672,IV.,
3673,IV.,"Undoubtedly; for all that, it was only a farthing. His face fell."
3674,IV.,"Still, a farthing was money, and pointed to money. Ah, how pleased"
3675,IV.,little mother Suttu would be!
3676,IV.,
3677,IV.,The thought transfixed him again; this time by excess of memory. What
3678,IV.,"had happened to her? What had he done? What cursed fate was this, that"
3679,IV.,he should find money on the very day when he had given up hope and
3680,IV.,"faith? His trembling legs would scarcely support him, as, driven by"
3681,IV.,"the necessity of knowing the worst, he stumbled towards the hut,"
3682,IV.,"wondering how he should ever face the saint's roly-poly, or how he"
3683,IV.,would endure life without Suttu's laugh to lighten his labours.
3684,IV.,
3685,IV.,"What was that echoing among the palms? Surely, surely, it was her"
3686,IV.,"laugh. Were the fiends playing tricks with him, or-- Hope literally"
3687,IV.,"gave him wings, for, as he galloped forward, the sheet he had thrown"
3688,IV.,"round his shoulders spread out on either side, and his matted hair,"
3689,IV.,"still bound with chaplets, blew round his head like an aureole. Suttu,"
3690,IV.,"standing on the steps, laughed louder at the ridiculous figure"
3691,IV.,"gambolling towards her, uttering little cries of joy."
3692,IV.,
3693,IV.,"If he had looked like a whipped hound a minute before, he was like a"
3694,IV.,"cur restored to favour now, in his delight quite forgetting the"
3695,IV.,"necessity for caution, till Suttu sternly asked him to explain. Then,"
3696,IV.,"inspired by elation, he lied magnificently. Was there no just cause"
3697,IV.,for joy when he had found the treasure?
3698,IV.,
3699,IV.,"""The treasure! Thou hast found it?"" cried the _fakeerni_, paling"
3700,IV.,"before the fear lest she had overlooked the real prize. ""Where--what"
3701,IV.,"treasure?"""
3702,IV.,
3703,IV.,"""The saint's treasure--lakhs on lakhs! Listen, O incredulous! O"
3704,IV.,"suspicious! and eat shame. Last night, urged by the virulence of thine"
3705,IV.,"enemies, I vowed a mighty vow for the accomplishment of thy desires,"
3706,IV.,"caring naught for my own ruin. I spread a cloth for my fairy, setting"
3707,IV.,"it well with flowers, and dancing to please her. But when she came,"
3708,IV.,"allured by my graces, I spurned her. Yea, I trampled her under foot. I"
3709,IV.,took my heart and hers out of our bodies and ate them before her face.
3710,IV.,"'Show me the treasures,' I cried; 'rescue my little mother Suttu from"
3711,IV.,"the necessity of marrying a one-eyed, pock-marked man, or I set no"
3712,IV.,"more cloths for thee!' Lo, thou shouldst have seen her clinging to me"
3713,IV.,"like a weanling child; but I would none of her! Then she grew wroth,"
3714,IV.,"saying she would ne'er return; but I answered, 'Who cares?' Think,"
3715,IV.,"_mai_ Suttu--I, Shâhbâsh, said that to my fairy for thy sake, and thou"
3716,IV.,"hast suspicions. Nay, smite me, but I said more. I said--what did I"
3717,IV.,"not say?--till--till she smote me on the forehead, so--and I died."
3718,IV.,"Yea, I died as much as a man may and yet live. So--so--she dug a grave"
3719,IV.,"for me--for she would not the jackals had my beauty. Yea, a grave! See"
3720,IV.,"you, it was not much of a grave--a poor grave, such as a woman's hand"
3721,IV.,"could make. Lo, my heart aches for the blisters there must be--"""
3722,IV.,
3723,IV.,"""Go on, liar,"" said Suttu, calmly, ""and let the blisters be. They will"
3724,IV.,"heal without thy lip-salve."""
3725,IV.,
3726,IV.,"""May I eat dirt if it be not true! Then, towards morning, being"
3727,IV.,"chastened by blisters, her heart melted: so she buried the treasure"
3728,IV.,"instead of me. That is how it came about."""
3729,IV.,
3730,IV.,Suttu could not resist a smile.
3731,IV.,
3732,IV.,"""But the treasure, fool--the treasure?"""
3733,IV.,
3734,IV.,"Shâhbâsh, dancing round her, flourished a coin, which she snatched"
3735,IV.,from him hastily.
3736,IV.,
3737,IV.,"""Lo!"" she cried, in tones of disappointment, ""'tis only a farthing."""
3738,IV.,
3739,IV.,"""Only a farthing!"" echoed Shâhbâsh, ironically. ""Hark to the"
3740,IV.,"incredulous. Aye, but it means gold close at hand. Dost not know that"
3741,IV.,"wise men put pennies when they take pounds, so that the _jinn_ who"
3742,IV.,"guards the treasure may find the tale true when he counts the coins?"""
3743,IV.,
3744,IV.,Suttu's hand went up swiftly to her forehead; she gave a little cry.
3745,IV.,
3746,IV.,"""Dost mean they put farthings in place of gold?"""
3747,IV.,
3748,IV.,"""Aye! Sure, a coin is a coin to the _jinn_, and when the last gold bit"
3749,IV.,"is gone he sits guarding a pot of farthings till judgment. Ho,"
3750,IV.,"ho!--ha, ha!"""
3751,IV.,
3752,IV.,His mirth left Suttu smileless.
3753,IV.,
3754,IV.,"""A pot--of--farthings,"" she muttered slowly. Then a light broke in on"
3755,IV.,"her, and she threw up her hands, exclaiming: ""Gone! Aye, he said it"
3756,IV.,"was gone, and we thought he meant--gone! Yea, it is clear! Gone, gone,"
3757,IV.,"gone!"""
3758,IV.,
3759,IV.,"""What is clear? What hath gone?"" asked Shâhbâsh, curiously. The need"
3760,IV.,for caution came home to her.
3761,IV.,
3762,IV.,"""'Tis clear thou art a fool,"" she said, ""and my trust in thee is gone."
3763,IV.,"Why cannot folk leave me alone?"" she continued, querulously. ""I only"
3764,IV.,"ask peace and quiet."""
3765,IV.,
3766,IV.,"And then, to the dwarf's horror and amazement, she suddenly began to"
3767,IV.,cry--_mai_ Suttu crying like any other woman!
3768,IV.,
3769,IV.,"""'Tis but the _pilu_-berries,"" he whimpered. ""Did I not tell thee they"
3770,IV.,"were watery diet, apt to turn acid and destroy the courage? But there"
3771,IV.,"shall be no more wild meats for thee, _mai_ Suttu. The treasure is"
3772,IV.,"found."""
3773,IV.,
3774,IV.,"It was, indeed. All that day the _fakeerni_ sat wondering what she had"
3775,IV.,"better do; but, if she was quick to carry out a suggestion, she had no"
3776,IV.,head for the weaving of plots and plans. The pot of farthings
3777,IV.,"represented a few rupees, but not enough to purchase witnesses and"
3778,IV.,conduct a case in court. The Kâzi's son would at least not give
3779,IV.,"evidence against her, but even the break-down of this particular claim"
3780,IV.,"would benefit her little. She must have something to live upon; and,"
3781,IV.,"what is more, nothing but the hope of discovering treasure would keep"
3782,IV.,"Shâhbâsh faithful to his salt, or induce the accountant to come to"
3783,IV.,terms.
3784,IV.,
3785,IV.,"Towards evening she strolled over to watch the dwarf, who had been"
3786,IV.,"digging the grave deeper and deeper, longer and longer."
3787,IV.,
3788,IV.,"""Art going to bury a saint, O Shâhbâsh?"" she asked, with a broad"
3789,IV.,smile.
3790,IV.,
3791,IV.,From the trench behind the growing mountain of soil came grunts and
3792,IV.,"groans. Then a verse of the Koran, mingled with something suspiciously"
3793,IV.,like curses.
3794,IV.,
3795,IV.,She sat down on the pile and looked over the level stretch dotted by
3796,IV.,"mud hillocks, with here and there a masonry tomb. On one of these a"
3797,IV.,"squirrel sat perched, hard at work on a peach-stone which some"
3798,IV.,wayfarer on the adjoining path had flung aside.
3799,IV.,
3800,IV.,Suttu's keen delight in open-air sights and sounds kept her watching
3801,IV.,the dainty little creature as it shifted the prize this way and that
3802,IV.,in its deft fingers so as to bring its teeth to bear on the hard
3803,IV.,"shell. It worked as hard as Shâhbâsh, she thought, with another of her"
3804,IV.,"broad smiles, and deserved the sweet kernel. No, another squirrel had"
3805,IV.,caught wind of the affair and came pirating along with tail full set.
3806,IV.,"Lo, 'twas a play to watch! Up and down, round and round. The"
3807,IV.,"peach-stone dropped here, snatched up there, now in this one's"
3808,IV.,"possession, now in that, until finally the new-comer sat in the place"
3809,IV.,"of the old, gnawing at the hard shell, and twisting it about with deft"
3810,IV.,fingers.
3811,IV.,
3812,IV.,"Suttu, with her chin on her hands, watched the second as she had the"
3813,IV.,first.
3814,IV.,
3815,IV.,"And, after all, there was no kernel in the peach-stone, nothing but a"
3816,IV.,shrivelled skin which had once----!
3817,IV.,
3818,IV.,"Suttu stood up, clapping her hands."
3819,IV.,
3820,IV.,"""_Shâhbâsh! Shâhbâsh!_"" she cried."
3821,IV.,
3822,IV.,The dwarf stuck his head out of the grave.
3823,IV.,
3824,IV.,"""Well, _mai_ Suttu, what is it now?"""
3825,IV.,
3826,IV.,"She turned with a flaunt of her petticoat, a flinging out of her round"
3827,IV.,arms.
3828,IV.,
3829,IV.,"""'Twas the other 'Shâhbâsh' I meant, but 'tis all one. Leave digging,"
3830,IV.,"and go and call Hussan, the father-in-law. I have made up my mind."""
3831,IV.,
3832,IV.,
3833,IV.,*   *   *   *   *
3834,IV.,
3835,IV.,
3836,IV.,"It was ten years after these events that the English boy, who had"
3837,IV.,"stayed proceedings in the date-picking, returned to the district as"
3838,IV.,"deputy commissioner. Gratitude, she averred, was her first reason for"
3839,IV.,appearing in my garden with a cunningly plaited basket of Deen Ali's
3840,IV.,fruit. Afterwards a mutual fancy between her and my young barbarians
3841,IV.,led to confidences when she came over with all sorts of odd toys made
3842,IV.,out of palm-leaves and supplies of young squirrels for the children.
3843,IV.,"She was still undoubtedly handsome, and the indisputable possessor of"
3844,IV.,the tomb and the date-trees. The graveyard with its rights of alms and
3845,IV.,"treasure had passed into the hands of the village accountant, in"
3846,IV.,consideration of a monthly pension of ten rupees.
3847,IV.,
3848,IV.,It was in answer to a query why she kept so many tame squirrels that
3849,IV.,this tale was told.
3850,IV.,
3851,IV.,"""And you had no difficulty in persuading your father-in-law?"""
3852,IV.,
3853,IV.,"""None, _Huzoor!_ God gave the bait, the fool swallowed it. The"
3854,IV.,"farthing Shâhbâsh found bought him, greed and all. It was better than"
3855,IV.,"fighting when the Kâzi would not swear to the marriage, and our names"
3856,IV.,were birth-names. He signed the stamp paper gladly; and the
3857,IV.,"perquisites have gone up again, so he hath lost nothing."""
3858,IV.,
3859,IV.,"""Shâhbâsh?"""
3860,IV.,
3861,IV.,"A big, broad smile came to her face."
3862,IV.,
3863,IV.,"""He digs, and his stomach is always full. What more can he want? The"
3864,IV.,squirrels are quite happy over the peach-stones while they are
3865,IV.,"gnawing. Shâhbâsh and the father-in-law think the kernel is inside,"
3866,IV.,"that is all. I know it is not. So we are both content."""
3867,IV.,
3868,IV.,"When I left the district on promotion, Suttu came out as I rode past"
3869,IV.,"the blue-tiled tomb on my way to the river, with a great sheaf of"
3870,IV.,"lotus-blossoms in her arms. A tame squirrel, reared from the perennial"
3871,IV.,"nest in the thatch, peered from the folds in her veil, with furtive,"
3872,IV.,"bright eyes. The parrots circled, screaming round the ripening dates,"
3873,IV.,"and but a minute before my horse had shied from a _karait_, curving"
3874,IV.,back to the prickly covert. The well known setting seemed a part of
3875,IV.,that familiar figure.
3876,IV.,
3877,IV.,"""May the Lord have the _Huzoor_ in his keeping ever!"" she said,"
3878,IV.,"decorously, as became a _fakeerni_. But her smile seemed to dim the"
3879,IV.,"sunlight, as with a gesture full of grace she flung the lotus-blossoms"
3880,IV.,in my path.
3881,IV.,
3882,IV.,That was my last sight of Suttu.

3891,I.,I.
3892,I.,
3893,I.,"It was a large, square block of a building, which had once been"
3894,I.,"somebody's palace. Not very old. That could be recognized by the odd,"
3895,I.,"reminiscent air of a Genoese palazzo which clung to it, proclaiming"
3896,I.,the influence of some Italian adventurer in the Mogul times. In those
3897,I.,"days, doubtless, its blank arcaded walls had risen from a terraced"
3898,I.,"orange-garden; but now the surrounding slums of a big, native city"
3899,I.,"ended abruptly, at varying distance, in an irregular brick-strewn"
3900,I.,"space, where buffaloes were tethered to eat street sweepings, and"
3901,I.,their refuse in its turn was set out to dry in fuel cakes--that being
3902,I.,"the last resort of matter in India, where poverty and greed fight for"
3903,I.,the uttermost farthing of utility. Besides the buffaloes and the
3904,I.,"refuse-heaps, the space in its longest angle showed the inevitable"
3905,I.,weaver's warp twined in and out of tiger-grass stalks stuck slantwise
3906,I.,"in the dust--inevitable, because it is never absent from an open"
3907,I.,"space in a native city. Sometimes solitary, like a huge worm impaled"
3908,I.,"and left to dry; more often tended by two chattering Fates, one on"
3909,I.,"each side, whose tongues gabble an accompaniment to the whirring"
3910,I.,bobbins tied to long sticks which dance a ladies' chain through the
3911,I.,"grass-stalks, as the bearers walk swiftly up and down the long length"
3912,I.,"of growing warp--up and down, with an outward swirl of a full"
3913,I.,"petticoat and a veil bulging backward, as the free brown arms twist"
3914,I.,"and twine. A common sight, a picturesque one withal, seeing that it"
3915,I.,shows a good figure at its best. Sometimes beyond these two Fates you
3916,I.,"may see Clotho spinning her lacquered wheel, but not often. As a rule"
3917,I.,"she hides in narrow alleys, where, set well over the central gutter on"
3918,I.,"a stool, she can discuss past, present, and future with half a dozen"
3919,I.,neighbours at a time.
3920,I.,
3921,I.,"For the rest, the building was distinctly imposing. Like a palazzo, it"
3922,I.,"was tunnelled by one single high archway, leading into a central"
3923,I.,"court-yard, decorously circled by orange-trees in tubs. Above these,"
3924,I.,"again, was a further likeness in the three tiers of graceful arcades"
3925,I.,"surrounding a square of deep ultramarine sky. There, however, the"
3926,I.,resemblance ended. A Genoese palace is sacred to silence and shadow;
3927,I.,"this was set apart to sunshine and sound, excepting on a gala day,"
3928,I.,when the philanthropic great ones came down to distribute prizes.
3929,I.,"Then it burst forth into carpets, awnings, curtains, and even the"
3930,I.,_Alif-Bey--wallahs_ (alphabet-class) in the first story bit their
3931,I.,tongues to keep them still. That was the noisiest story. All day long
3932,I.,"the inmates chanted letters in high childish voices, while the"
3933,I.,"monitors stood over them like the parent bird, ready to drop a fresh"
3934,I.,titbit of knowledge into the clamorous mouths.
3935,I.,
3936,I.,"Up-stairs, in the primary department, the babel had lost its first"
3937,I.,barbarous simplicity; the makers of it did not always understand what
3938,I.,"they themselves were saying, and the uncertainty of all things had"
3939,I.,"damped their infant light-heartedness. Higher again, in the third"
3940,I.,"story, quite an academic silence prevailed among the girls working"
3941,I.,"away at Euclid, algebra, and all the 'ologies, and they had learned an"
3942,I.,automatic thrust forward of the arm towards the teacher worthy of a
3943,I.,British board school. This never failed to please exotic philanthropy.
3944,I.,"The connection may not have been quite clear, but this particular"
3945,I.,branch of knowledge was invariably looked upon as a sign that
3946,I.,education was really at last beginning to leaven the mass of
3947,I.,deplorable female ignorance in India.
3948,I.,
3949,I.,"Perhaps it was. Certainly this school, with its court-yard devoted to"
3950,I.,the _dhoolies_ in which the pupils were carried to and from their
3951,I.,"lessons, and its three stories of different standards, formed a"
3952,I.,"perfect ladder of learning; the lowermost rung being the listless,"
3953,I.,lazy group of bearers lounging in the gateway with the female
3954,I.,chaperons until four o'clock chimed from a hundred gongs in the
3955,I.,city. Then they earned a monthly pay from the Government by
3956,I.,carrying the climbers of the ladder back to their homes in decent
3957,I.,"seclusion--playing, as it were, the part of Prince Hassan's carpet in"
3958,I.,"transporting them into another hemisphere--nay, more, another world."
3959,I.,"At any rate, from algebra and the exact sciences to a cell of four"
3960,I.,"walls, and, if Fate were kind, a few square yards of flat roof open to"
3961,I.,the sky. Something of a mental somersault; therefore it was perhaps as
3962,I.,"well in one point of view, if not in another, that many of the"
3963,I.,claimants to genteel seclusion who were comfortably carried by a
3964,I.,"paternal Government to their own doors, could, on arrival, set aside"
3965,I.,the convenient pretence and go about to see their friends with the
3966,I.,more simple and less costly protection of a veil.
3967,I.,
3968,I.,"""_Ari_, sister!"" said a young, dissipated-looking lounger in the gate;"
3969,I.,"""there is that baby awake again. Go, Chundoo, and call Fâtma."""
3970,I.,
3971,I.,"The woman addressed--a big, brazen lump--went yawning and stretching"
3972,I.,to stand on the bottom step of the arched stairway. Then she called
3973,I.,into the clamour above:
3974,I.,
3975,I.,"""Fâtma! Fâtma! The baby is awake."""
3976,I.,
3977,I.,"Her hard tones echoed up the arcades, but the sing-song went on"
3978,I.,"without a break. After a while, however, a pattering step came down"
3979,I.,"the stairs, bringing into view a child of about ten, with a sharp, old"
3980,I.,"face. Her blue trousers were rent at the knees, her skinny hands"
3981,I.,inconceivably smeared with ink--there was more ink than hand--and the
3982,I.,"coarse cotton cloth she wore as a veil was frayed, worn, and dirty."
3983,I.,"Beneath it, the odd little galloon of plaited hair on her forehead"
3984,I.,"showed sun-bleached and rumpled, despite its tightness. A competent"
3985,I.,observer could have told at once that she belonged to the Cashmiri
3986,I.,"quarter, and to either a poverty-stricken or a bereaved house. No"
3987,I.,mother's fingers had been at that plaited hair for weeks.
3988,I.,
3989,I.,"""Where is Peru?"" she began shrilly, still coming down the stairs."
3990,I.,"""Gambling and dicing, or snoozing and sleeping. How am I to win"
3991,I.,"scholarships if my days are lost over a baby? _Ai_, sluggard! is that"
3992,I.,"you? Art not ashamed of thyself?"""
3993,I.,
3994,I.,"So, passing through the knot of jeering men into a dark recess in the"
3995,I.,"entry, till her rating ceased over a year-old baby whimpering on the"
3996,I.,"floor on a ragged quilt. ""Peace! peace, my son, it is I, Fâtma--yea,"
3997,I.,"it is Fâtma, thy father's sister."""
3998,I.,
3999,I.,"The baby's fat, yellow legs--for it was one of those fair Cashmiri"
4000,I.,children who look sickly among the brown ones--were astride her curved
4001,I.,"hip, the whole balance of her thin bare body against its weight, as"
4002,I.,she paused once more among the men to fling a parting gibe at the
4003,I.,sluggard.
4004,I.,

4007,I.,"A roar of laughter greeted the words, in which the girl joined, not"
4008,I.,"because she quite understood its cause, but because she was quick"
4009,I.,"enough to see that it was at Peru's expense, not hers. The veil which"
4010,I.,Nature draws to protect childhood counts for little among the men and
4011,I.,"women busy in drawing one to conceal their own unnatural vice, but"
4012,I.,Fâtma's hoary knowledge of evil did not extend to a _double entendre_.
4013,I.,"She repeated her sally in childish ineptitude, till Peru with a curse"

4025,I.,
4026,I.,Meanwhile the object of their remarks had begun to climb the stairs
4027,I.,with her heavy burden. She had to sit down every now and again to
4028,I.,"rest, for she was but a poor scrap of a thing, ill-fed from her birth."

4042,I.,
4043,I.,"""_Ari!_ Is that babe hungry again?"" queried a tall girl, flashing past"

4056,I.,
4057,I.,"Fâtma's foot was on the ladder again, for the babe, having sucked the"
4058,I.,"ink from her thumb, demanded something more satisfying."
4059,I.,
4060,I.,"Oh, how quiet it was up here in the long, matted corridor! One seemed"
4061,I.,to have left the stress of life behind. Through the doorways leading
4062,I.,into darker rooms you could see groups of girls and women squatted on
4063,I.,"the floor over their low desks. Here busy over pen and ink, here"
4064,I.,murmuring from books. More circled round the terrestrial globe. An odd
4065,I.,"company: some wrinkled and old, with shaven head and white shroud;"
4066,I.,"others dressed in the same fashion, but fair and fresh. Hindu widows"
4067,I.,"these, seeking solace for death in life endured or yet to come. A"
4068,I.,"young Sikh wife or two ablaze--ears, nose, and forehead--with jingling"
4069,I.,"gold set thick with jewels. And here, sharper than any, with finger"
4070,I.,"pointing to the pole, a small Bengali girl, who had been married these"
4071,I.,"seven years gone, and looked a perfect child."
4072,I.,
4073,I.,All this interested Fâtma not at all. She had seen it too often. Her
4074,I.,"goal lay in the end room among the second-year students, who sat on"

4085,I.,"teacher, sternly, as a delicate-looking young woman, rather"
4086,I.,"overdressed and overscented, took the child from Fâtma with a sigh,"
4087,I.,and retired to a corner.
4088,I.,
4089,I.,"""Fâtma breaks them on purpose,"" replied the mother, sullenly; ""she"
4090,I.,"says they disagree with him."""
4091,I.,
4092,I.,"""Yea, 'tis true,"" assented Fâtma, gravely; ""they give him a pain in"

4094,I.,"always tired, and Peru is too lazy."""
4095,I.,
4096,I.,Teacher looked at the little sharp face and was silent. That

4098,I.,gambled away the five rupees he gained by helping to carry his wife
4099,I.,"and other students to and from the school; shiftless Hoshiarbi, who"
4100,I.,"spent half her scholarship of ten rupees on her clothes; and Fâtma,"
4101,I.,"whose eight annas, a week for cleaning the writing-boards seemed to"
4102,I.,"keep the whole going, was a perpetual puzzle to the English lady, even"
4103,I.,without the child. And with it? She felt quite relieved when
4104,I.,Hoshiaribi came back to her equation minus the baby.
4105,I.,
4106,I.,The afternoon sun was slanting in bars through the closed grass
4107,I.,"chicks, making the floors ring-streaked. It was close on four o'clock;"
4108,I.,the tide of learning slackened at full flood. Down-stairs among the
4109,I.,"little ones, first to go, there would only be time to chant ""_One and"
4110,I.,"one make two--oo--oo_"" a few times more; so Fâtma sat down in the"
4111,I.,"sunny, sleepy corridor, with the baby in her limited lap; and as she"
4112,I.,"sat thinking, heaven knows of what, she jogged the base of its skull"
4113,I.,backward and forward on the palm of her supporting hand in approved
4114,I.,native fashion. She did not know that it conduces to slight concussion
4115,I.,"of the brain and consequent coma, convenient to the nurse; but she"
4116,I.,knew mother always did it. This odd little woman of ten knew most of
4117,I.,"the old-fashioned, old-established ways of the world she lived in;"
4118,I.,"and when the value of B had been discovered, she saw Hoshiaribi and"
4119,I.,"the baby into the folds of a white domino, and so, on their way"
4120,I.,"down-stairs to the husband, the curtained _dhoolie_, and the oblong"
4121,I.,room up two flights of stairs in the Cashmiri quarter. Then she came
4122,I.,"to linger sturdily yet unobtrusively in the corridor, till teacher,"
4123,I.,"coming out, busy over a mass of papers, nearly fell over her."
4124,I.,
4125,I.,"""Gracious me, child! what do you want? Why aren't you down-stairs?"""
4126,I.,
4127,I.,Perhaps Fâtma had been rehearsing her petition while she was nursing
4128,I.,"the baby; anyhow, she had it clear and pat."
4129,I.,
4130,I.,"""_Huzoor_, I want promotion to the primary department. It is such a"
4131,I.,"long way to carry the baby to Hoshiaribi, and he sleeps not at all"
4132,I.,among the infants. We make too much noise. And Peru goes away gambling
4133,I.,"and forgets him, so I get no time for study. Thus, when Hoshiaribi's"
4134,I.,"scholarship ends next year we shall be destitute, since Peru's money"
4135,I.,"goes in quail-fighting, and we cannot fill our stomachs on eight"
4136,I.,"annas."""
4137,I.,
4138,I.,"Incontrovertible facts, every one of them."
4139,I.,
4140,I.,"""Have you read your grammar through?"""
4141,I.,
4142,I.,Fâtma shook her head.
4143,I.,
4144,I.,"""Oh no, _Huzoor!_ But the baby could sleep in the upper primary, and"
4145,I.,"then, Miss Sahib, I could soon read it. Now I am always on the"
4146,I.,"stairs."""
4147,I.,
4148,I.,"Another incontrovertible fact. Teacher had visions of the big,"
4149,I.,yellow-legged baby going up and down the ladder of learning on Fâtma's
4150,I.,"curved hip. That, however, could not possibly be held equivalent to a"
4151,I.,pass from one department to another. Yet the child's face was deadly
4152,I.,earnest; a sudden sympathy and compassion brought a promise to
4153,I.,consider the matter.
4154,I.,
4155,I.,"""But there are already three babies in the primary!"" shrilled the"
4156,I.,"Mohammedan head of that department, a portly lady with voluminous"
4157,I.,"skirts trailing behind her, and red betel-stained teeth. There was no"
4158,I.,one in the school from the top story to the bottom who was the equal
4159,I.,"in deportment of Mumtaza Mihr--un--nissa Begum, whose father had been"
4160,I.,"Munshi to some dead-and-gone Mogul. To begin with, she could silence"
4161,I.,"every one with Persian epithets, and the pebbles of her polished"
4162,I.,"speech hit hard. ""These may Providence protect, but God hath sent this"
4163,I.,proof of his bounty to a handmaiden who is 'second-year student.'
4164,I.,What! are we to reduce this gift of the Most High to a standard
4165,I.,"beneath its birth? Let Hoshiaribi, out of her plenty, appoint a"
4166,I.,"wet-nurse, or let its amiable aunt supply it with 'Maw' at four annas."
4167,I.,"To allow her a primary pass without due qualification, in my poor"
4168,I.,"thought, is non-regulation; and, in addition, a bad precedent."""
4169,I.,
4170,I.,"Mumtaza mihr-un-nissa bowed her sleek, net-veiled head, and threw out"
4171,I.,"her podgy fat hands, as if deprecating her own opinions."
4172,I.,
4173,I.,"For all that, Fâtma stayed among the infants, and spent most of her"
4174,I.,"time on the wide stairs with the yellow-legged baby, while Peru joked"
4175,I.,"shamelessly with Chundoo on the sunshiny steps, and Hoshiaribi, in the"
4176,I.,"academic silence up-stairs, worked a crewel antimacassar between the"
4177,I.,"equations. It suited her indolent, comfort-loving nature. Ever since"
4178,I.,"she entered the school, nearly sixteen years ago, she had been in"
4179,I.,receipt of a scholarship of sorts. At the beginning influence may have
4180,I.,"had something to do with her good fortune, for her mother was only a"
4181,I.,"poor, good-looking Cashmiri, and her reputed father dead. But since"
4182,I.,"then she had justified her selection. If not clever, she was studious,"
4183,I.,and quite understood that learning meant livelihood. In the good old
4184,I.,"days when the one great object was to catch and keep a scholar, this"
4185,I.,"might have gone on indefinitely; but now, under new rules,"
4186,I.,"Hoshiaribi's scholarship would cease in a year, whether she passed or"
4187,I.,"did not pass. Then she must become a teacher, or starve on Peru's five"
4188,I.,rupees.
4189,I.,
4190,I.,The prospect was not pleasing. It would be a very different thing
4191,I.,"having to worry over thirty unwilling pupils in a poky little room,"
4192,I.,spending part of your own pay in bribes so as to get the grant for
4193,I.,"attendance, and then never knowing from day to day if some neighbourly"
4194,I.,spite would not result in empty mats on inspection-days.
4195,I.,
4196,I.,"""But if you pass,"" suggested a Hindu widow in her class, ""you can go"
4197,I.,"on, as I am doing, into the medical school. That is two years' more"
4198,I.,"scholarship, and certain employment afterwards."""
4199,I.,
4200,I.,"""'Tis all very well for you,"" muttered Hoshiaribi, sullenly. ""You only"
4201,I.,came in three years ago. I have been here all my life. I like it. I
4202,I.,don't want to go home and nurse the babies. I don't want to work. The
4203,I.,"committee paid me to learn, and I have learned. I will learn anything"
4204,I.,"else they like. Why, then, should they take away my scholarship?"""
4205,I.,
4206,I.,"""How foolish you are!"" said the little Bengali; ""you don't seem to"
4207,I.,"_understand_ what a _scholarship_ is."""
4208,I.,
4209,I.,"""Perhaps I don't,"" retorted Hoshiaribi, flushing up. ""My fathers were"
4210,I.,"not scriveners and quill-drivers since creation, like yours. My people"
4211,I.,are poor. If I go home I must spin and grind corn. I will not. I tell
4212,I.,"you _I will not!_ That is an end of it."""
4213,I.,
4214,I.,"""Then you must teach."""
4215,I.,
4216,I.,"""I don't want to teach. I want to stay here and learn."""
4217,I.,
4218,I.,"""Be quiet, girls!"" reproved the English teacher. ""Do stick to your"
4219,I.,"lessons, and remember why you come here. Think, just think, of the"
4220,I.,"money that is being spent on your education!"""
4221,I.,
4222,I.,Hoshiaribi gave a triumphant glance at the Bengali girl. That was it.
4223,I.,"They had paid her to learn, and she had learned. The rest was an"
4224,I.,injustice.
4225,I.,
4226,I.,
4227,I.,
4228,II.,II.
4229,II.,
4230,II.,"A loud, resounding slap, another, and another! A torrent of irrelevant"
4231,II.,abuse in a strange tongue. Then something which is the same all over
4232,II.,the world--a fit of hysterics.
4233,II.,
4234,II.,"Hoshiaribi, as she stormed and sobbed and laughed, might have been any"
4235,II.,"spoiled, overwrought young woman in any country."
4236,II.,
4237,II.,"That was an end of everything. After slaving for months, after doing"
4238,II.,"without a new bodice in order to pay the ungrateful imps, after"
4239,II.,"cozening and flattering their stupid, cow-like mothers, it had come to"
4240,II.,"this: that Sultani, on whose performances Hoshiari relied for a fair"
4241,II.,"inspection, had divided four thousand one hundred and seven by six"
4242,II.,thousand three hundred and two. She had not only tried to divide
4243,II.,"it--she had divided it--with a quotient of fifty-six, and a remainder"
4244,II.,of five thousand and three. It was too much--too much in every way;
4245,II.,"with Peru lounging all day at the Central flirting with Chundoo,"
4246,II.,"Fâtma thinking of nothing but the babies, the gold edge on the dress"
4247,II.,"she must wear at the wedding next week wanting renewal, and"
4248,II.,inspection-day next month.
4249,II.,
4250,II.,She propped herself up against the whitewashed wall at one end of the
4251,II.,"room, Sultani, the injured prize pupil, at the other, and the two"
4252,II.,"sobbed vindictively across the intervening space, while a connecting"
4253,II.,"circle of alphabet-learners whimpered in sympathy with some one,"
4254,II.,"which, they scarcely knew, for they were mites of babies, not six"
4255,II.,years old any of them.
4256,II.,
4257,II.,"The women up and down the central stair, which served also as a sort"
4258,II.,"of drain and dust-bin, came attracted by the hope of a scene, to"
4259,II.,discuss the whole aspect of the affair without the least reserve. Peru
4260,II.,"was a bad lot, and it was sheer tyranny of the _Sirkar_ to have"
4261,II.,refused Hoshiar a scholarship after all these years. At the same time
4262,II.,"she was a poor, flighty creature, and had no business to slap their"
4263,II.,children; the latter train of thought becoming accentuated by the
4264,II.,arrival from a neighbouring tenement of Sultani's mother. Was it for
4265,II.,this her daughter had been bribed away shamelessly for a neighbouring
4266,II.,"""missen,"" where, if they did read the Bible and try to pervert the"
4267,II.,"scholars, they made up for it in prizes? Was it for this that"
4268,II.,base-born brat of a base-born mother had taken one rupee a month out
4269,II.,of Hoshiar's own pocket? These two questions were the theses of a
4270,II.,"controversy, which spread like wild-fire till it embraced the personal"
4271,II.,"history of every one present, and the room was a seething mass of"
4272,II.,"excited women, bordered by a whimpering circle of small girls, until a"
4273,II.,little figure came rushing up the stairs and forced itself into the
4274,II.,thickest of the clamour.
4275,II.,
4276,II.,It was Fâtma returning from her daily marketing. Her already scrimped
4277,II.,veil was further abridged by all the corners being utilized as bags
4278,II.,for her various purchases; and as she flung out her skinny brown arms
4279,II.,"in the small space still left between the combatants, and turned first"
4280,II.,"to one side and then to the other in vociferous reproach, her weighted"
4281,II.,"veil swung out, leaving her body quite bare. It was not much bigger;"
4282,II.,"certainly no fatter than it had been, eighteen months gone, when she"
4283,II.,had struggled up the ladder of learning with the yellow-legged baby.
4284,II.,
4285,II.,"""_Ari_, mothers! _Ari_, sisters!"" she scolded in her thin child's"
4286,II.,"voice. ""This is unseemly! This is a deplorable word! Have you"
4287,II.,"forgotten this house is a school? You come here to learn, not to make"
4288,II.,"beast-like noises! What a bad example! Does not shame come to you?"""
4289,II.,
4290,II.,"The fateful phrases, which had so often reduced the infant department"
4291,II.,"to tears, fell powerless, and Fâtma's own imperious temper asserted"
4292,II.,itself. She turned like a whirlwind to the alphabet-learners; they
4293,II.,"were her special charge, they at least should obey her."
4294,II.,
4295,II.,"""Come, my daughters,"" she cried, ""let us leave this scene of infamy."
4296,II.,"This is no place for us people. Come, let us go!"""
4297,II.,
4298,II.,"The circle stood up instinctively. They adored Fâtma; besides, the"
4299,II.,"chance of escape was welcome. She thrust her new nephew, a babe of"
4300,II.,"three months, who had been squalling patiently in a corner, into the"
4301,II.,"biggest girl's arms, seized on the yellow-legged one herself, and so,"
4302,II.,"full of dignity, headed the little procession."
4303,II.,
4304,II.,"The women, touched by the passionate delight in children's ways which"
4305,II.,"is so marked among them, fell back with sudden laughter."
4306,II.,
4307,II.,"""_Ai! dil aziz! Wah_, the little marionettes. See how they go like old"
4308,II.,"women! Heart's-core! are we so wicked? Look at my Amma, Fuzli--not"
4309,II.,"four, I swear, and grave as a judge! _Tobah! tobah!_ Go not, little"
4310,II.,"lives. We are sorry. See, we bite our tongues, we hold our ears."""
4311,II.,
4312,II.,"So, squatting down, standing aside, reaching over, the women,"
4313,II.,"chattering their amusement, let the babies pass. And, as for Fâtma,"
4314,II.,"she was ""_pucki, burri pucki_."" God knows why, but the bairns were set"
4315,II.,"to obey her. This one's Miriam, not four till _Baisakh_, leaped out of"
4316,II.,"bed at her first call, as she came her morning rounds for the pupils,"
4317,II.,and that one's Janet had been known to refuse her breakfast if Fâtma
4318,II.,"said it was late. Aye--_pucki, burri pucki_--for good, not evil, and"
4319,II.,"'twere well others were more like her. So, with side sniffs, they"
4320,II.,"pattered up and down the stairs to their several abodes, leaving"
4321,II.,"Hoshiaribi sulkily exhausted. Sultani and her mother, as they went"
4322,II.,casting glances of final scorn at the odd little row of maidens ranged
4323,II.,"along the gutter in the sunshine, piping away the incontrovertible"
4324,II.,"fact that ""_one and one make two--oo--oo_"" while Fâtma and her babies"
4325,II.,sat opposite on a door-step and led the chorus.
4326,II.,
4327,II.,"So that was an end of the incident for one day. Unfortunately, it was"
4328,II.,"not the first of its kind, and Hoshiaribi had almost made up her mind"
4329,II.,"that it should be the last. She lay, feeling a perfect worm, as any"
4330,II.,"woman, East or West, might have done after the turmoil, kicking one"
4331,II.,heel petulantly over the side of the string-bed on which she had flung
4332,II.,"herself, and looked at the map of Asia and the map of Europe, which"
4333,II.,"hung on opposite walls, with equal abhorrence. She hated everything,"
4334,II.,"everybody. The last six months, since her failure to pass had sent her"
4335,II.,"as a favour to the lowest pay of a branch-school teacher, had been"
4336,II.,"sheer misery to her. For her husband's neglect she did not care, save"
4337,II.,in so far as it gave her complaint a sound basis. She had been
4338,II.,"betrothed to him, and so she had married him; but the six years since"
4339,II.,she had lived with him as his wife had only taught her that she could
4340,II.,"set her duty to him aside without reproach, for the sake of ten rupees"
4341,II.,"a month, and that he was quite content with this arrangement. She"
4342,II.,"looked once more round the long, narrow slip of a room with its mud"
4343,II.,"floor, its smoky rafters, its single-shuttered window two feet square,"
4344,II.,"giving on a close alley; then she thought of the cool, matted"
4345,II.,"corridors of the Genoese palazzo, the leisurely studies, the ease of"
4346,II.,"ten rupees compared with six, and rolled over, face down on the bed,"
4347,II.,"whimpering. She hated teaching, but it was that or starvation. At"
4348,II.,least--unless--
4349,II.,
4350,II.,"Some one came jingling up the stairs, heralded by a strong smell of"
4351,II.,"musk. Hoshiaribi set up frowning; for all that, content to be"
4352,II.,"interrupted, since Meran bibi, reputation or no reputation, was at any"
4353,II.,rate able to talk. At least she knew something of the world beyond
4354,II.,"that swarming yet dead-alive Cashmiri quarter, for she had been"
4355,II.,"show-pupil for years at another branch school, knew the three first"
4356,II.,"readers by heart, and, after a somewhat tarnished girlhood, had"
4357,II.,"married a policeman; consequently, she was not a woman to be scorned"
4358,II.,"in the quarter, just because folks' tongues had cause to wag. She was"
4359,II.,"a buxom person, with oily hair, great bosses of silver tassels in her"
4360,II.,"ears, and a perfunctory veil of Manchester hitched on to the very back"
4361,II.,"of her head and drawn tight over her high bust. Finally, she had the"
4362,II.,usual shrill voice in which she could always tell her gossip of the
4363,II.,"latest ""fassen"" in the cutting of a bodice or the number of suits in a"
4364,II.,"bride's trousseau, for she came of a tailor family, and spent all her"
4365,II.,"days in gadding about, despite her pretence to the _purdah_; an"
4366,II.,"institution which is, as a rule, only inviolable when exotic"
4367,II.,benevolence seeks to interfere with it.
4368,II.,
4369,II.,She and Hoshiaribi fell on each other's necks in an elaborate stage
4370,II.,"embrace, and then crouched up side by side upon the string-bed."
4371,II.,
4372,II.,"After a time, however, Hoshiaribi moved to put her head out of the"
4373,II.,window and call to Fâtma below:
4374,II.,
4375,II.,"""Send those brats away--it must be close on four--and make some tea."
4376,II.,"My head aches."""
4377,II.,
4378,II.,"Surely, when the Creator made women with his right hand, his left must"
4379,II.,"have been busy over tea. These two groups had it sickly sweet,"
4380,II.,"cinnamon-flavoured, in little basins with an English flag, and ""Union"
4381,II.,"is Strength"" upon them in gay colours."
4382,II.,
4383,II.,"""Yea, 'tis true, Hoshiaribi. A star of emerald with a red centre,"
4384,II.,"three crinkles of gold lace, like a 'heart's comfort' in pattern on"
4385,II.,"the breast, and two rows of seed-pearls round the collar. Then the"
4386,II.,"bridal dress! To begin with, a full skirt--for, look you, the newest"
4387,II.,"'fassen' is six breadths, gored--"""
4388,II.,
4389,II.,"So on, and so on, while the map of Europe winked at the map of Asia;"
4390,II.,"and Fâtma, after making the tea, was kneading as for dear life at the"
4391,II.,"dough of bare flour and water which, with the smear of some curd, was"
4392,II.,to form the household dinner.
4393,II.,
4394,II.,"""Thou couldst see it easily,"" continued Meran, ""and thou deservedst"
4395,II.,something to cheer thee after those senseless fools. Come! I could
4396,II.,"take thee by the Mori gate, a step from here; so into the gardens."
4397,II.,Lord! how they smell of orange blossoms--like any bride. Then we could
4398,II.,come home by the Badâmi bazar. To think thou hast never seen these
4399,II.,"things, and thou so clever--one who has learned wisdom of the"
4400,II.,"_sahibs_! _Wah!_ it tickles me."""
4401,II.,
4402,II.,"Meran's peal of laughter crackled like thorns, and Hoshiaribi flushed"
4403,II.,up.
4404,II.,
4405,II.,"""I could have gone had I wished. Peru should not stop me. But I have"
4406,II.,"not chosen."""
4407,II.,
4408,II.,"""Peru! Why, I tell thee, Hoshiaribi, he will marry the widow Chundoo."
4409,II.,"Tchut! what matters it if thou art not a fool, slaving away to no"
4410,II.,"purpose? Look you, they wanted me to keep school. Not I! Come,"
4411,II.,"Hoshiaribi, 'twill do thy head good. I have to buy new tinsel for a"
4412,II.,"_kurta_, and the bazar is worth seeing. A fair for noise, with the"
4413,II.,criers selling sugar-cane and fresh fritters. The shops full of
4414,II.,"jewels, the people crowding, the soldiers marching up and down, the"
4415,II.,"_mem-sahibas_ in their carriages, and, above all, the wooden balconies"
4416,II.,with the girls in white nodding and smiling; but the great ones like
4417,II.,"Chandni, of Delhi, stand up and salaam as the big folk go by. Yet she"
4418,II.,is naught to look at. Thou wouldst be twice her match for looks wert
4419,II.,"thou not so pale."""
4420,II.,
4421,II.,Half an hour afterwards Fâtma was alone in the room. The babies were
4422,II.,"asleep, so she had taken out a sort of lapstone, and was busy punching"
4423,II.,"gilt thread into stars through the front of a shoe upper. That, by"
4424,II.,"rights, was Peru's hereditary trade, which he had deserted in favour"
4425,II.,of _dhooli_ bearing and a fixed salary of five rupees a month. It
4426,II.,"came, therefore, more naturally than anything else to Fâtma, and so,"
4427,II.,"when the babies left leisure, she earned a pice or two by sweating for"
4428,II.,an old woman and her crippled grandson who lived up the same stair and
4429,II.,were employed by a big shop. But for these odd earnings life could not
4430,II.,"have gone on at all, what with Hoshiaribi's tea, and Peru's inroads"
4431,II.,for dinner or supper when he was short himself.
4432,II.,
4433,II.,"There he was, even now, coming up the stair lazily. Fâtma had put away"
4434,II.,"her lapstone ere he arrived, and was ready to greet him with calm"
4435,II.,"contumely, even while she set two cakes a toasting in the embers, and"
4436,II.,"brought out the green leaf of curds. If the one was his right, as"
4437,II.,"master of the house, the other was hers as mistress; and she exercised"
4438,II.,"it fully, Hoshiaribi being away with Mai Rajjun, who had a new baby;"
4439,II.,for Fâtma had no scruples about abstract truth when face to face with
4440,II.,the absence of a wife and the presence of an inquiring husband. With
4441,II.,that same unconscious knowledge that it was the right thing to do
4442,II.,"which had made her jog the baby's cerebellum to keep it quiet, she"
4443,II.,lied cheerfully to avoid possible disturbance. Peru accepted the
4444,II.,"explanation with a like indifference to its truth. To begin with, that"
4445,II.,same indifference to all save appearance is a common feature among
4446,II.,husbands; and then Peru would not have been exactly sorry to feel
4447,II.,cause of complaint. It would have balanced his own indiscretion.
4448,II.,"Briefly, he had married Chundoo two days before, and had come to break"
4449,II.,the fact to his first wife. There must be something painfully bald
4450,II.,about such a statement to European readers. When fully one half of
4451,II.,"harrowing modern fiction is based upon the axiom that Thingumbob,"
4452,II.,"having married So-and-So, cannot possibly marry What's-his-name also,"
4453,II.,it takes the starch out of a story when a hero can have as many wives
4454,II.,"as he likes, and his religion counsels four."
4455,II.,
4456,II.,"The facts in this case were extremely bald. Chundoo, the chaperone, an"
4457,II.,"elderly widow, had taken a fancy to the handsome young scamp; and"
4458,II.,"having been appointed doorkeeper to a new female hospital, thought it"
4459,II.,"more respectable to have a man of her own. Then, _dhooli_-bearers got"
4460,II.,"six rupees at the hospital, instead of five at the school. That,"
4461,II.,"sordid as it may seem, was why Peru had news to tell. The reason for"
4462,II.,his telling it was this: he knew perfectly well that Hoshiaribi would
4463,II.,"never consent to live in the same house as Chundoo, and so his"
4464,II.,"responsibility for her maintenance would cease, as he could plead"
4465,II.,poverty against any claim for separate alimony. As for her pay as a
4466,II.,"teacher, that, if Central school gossip said true, would not be for"
4467,II.,long; but Fâtma would look after the babies somehow. Such were his
4468,II.,thoughts as he sat watching the child's odd little figure busy over
4469,II.,"the cakes, which he did not want, seeing that his new bride had given"
4470,II.,him _kababs_ and _bakkharkana_ for breakfast. He had a sort of
4471,II.,"affection for Fâtma, who was the only relation he had in that part of"
4472,II.,"the world. He did not mean her to starve, and, if she could not"
4473,II.,"manage, it would be easy to give a rupee or two on the sly. What he"
4474,II.,"_did_ want was to keep Chundoo in a good temper, by showing"
4475,II.,conclusively that Hoshiaribi had no hold on his affections.
4476,II.,
4477,II.,"To be sure, he had shown this illegally for some months back, but now"
4478,II.,law and order demanded something legitimate; so he would respectfully
4479,II.,"command her to come and live with Chundoo, and, when she refused, be"
4480,II.,"quit of responsibility: for polygamy is made for the virtuous, not for"
4481,II.,the vicious.
4482,II.,
4483,II.,"Suddenly Fâtma looked at him, sniffed, and looked at him again."
4484,II.,
4485,II.,"""Thou hast been to a wedding--whose?"" she asked, suspiciously. In"
4486,II.,"truth, an odour of orange blossom and _attar_ began to be apparent in"
4487,II.,"the close room. Peru coughed, hesitated; it was a good beginning, and"
4488,II.,might save him a scene with his wife; so he began.
4489,II.,
4490,II.,"""H'm!"" commented Fâtma; ""then that's an end of bread for your stomach."
4491,II.,"God be praised!"" That is how it struck her."
4492,II.,
4493,II.,"""Little imp of sin!"" cried Peru, seizing her half roughly, half"
4494,II.,"jestingly, by the shoulder. ""Keep a quieter tongue in thy head, or"
4495,II.,"I'll find a husband to gag thee."""
4496,II.,
4497,II.,"She gave a shrill laugh of scorn, and twisted herself from his hold."
4498,II.,
4499,II.,"""A husband, indeed! Then Chundoo will take the babies? _Ai budzart!_"
4500,II.,"Think not I do not understand. Let be. They are my babies, not thine;"
4501,II.,"and, thank God, I go not to bed hungry this night."""
4502,II.,
4503,II.,"She sat herself down on the floor as she spoke, and began calmly on"
4504,II.,the cakes she had been toasting.
4505,II.,
4506,II.,"""Go, my brother--go back to thy Chundoo,"" she said, eying him"
4507,II.,"disdainfully--from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot,"
4508,II.,"dissolute idler was writ all over him--""Go! we have no need of thee."""
4509,II.,"Then her dignity gave way; she leaped to her feet, scattering the"
4510,II.,"broken cakes upon the floor, and the echoes of her plain speaking"
4511,II.,followed him down-stairs and flooded up into the room where Lalu the
4512,II.,"cripple sat, with a ray of sunlight glittering on the gold thread he"
4513,II.,was laying on the leather.
4514,II.,
4515,II.,"""Heaven save her husband!"" he muttered good-humoredly. Then he sighed."
4516,II.,Perhaps the thought that he would never have even a shrewish wife
4517,II.,oppressed him. When his grandmother died he would be quite alone in
4518,II.,"the dark room, with the glittering thread which seemed to make the"
4519,II.,"darkness more dingy and dreary. He was a young man of five-and-twenty,"
4520,II.,"who might stand years of imprisonment in those four walls,"
4521,II.,with--Heaven be praised!--a scrap of roof open to the sunlight beyond;
4522,II.,"that is to say, if he could pay the rent. He looked down at his fine,"
4523,II.,"supple hands and smiled, knowing that so long as they were left there"
4524,II.,"was no fear. If only the rest of him had been to match, instead of"
4525,II.,"marred, twisted, helpless!"
4526,II.,
4527,II.,"""'Tis God's will,"" he said half aloud, as fervently as any Christian;"
4528,II.,"for there are saints of all creeds, and this poor cripple, up three"
4529,II.,"flights of stairs in the Cashmiri quarter, was one of them. Then he"
4530,II.,"took to thinking tenderly of the odd little girl downstairs, whom his"
4531,II.,grandmother did out of the uttermost farthing. Poor little soul! when
4532,II.,he was alone he would at least be able to give her what was due.
4533,II.,
4534,II.,"Meanwhile Fâtma, down-stairs, was nursing her childish yet all too"
4535,II.,comprehending wrath against Peru for Hoshiaribi's return. Would she
4536,II.,not be angry? It would serve Peru right if she went off straight to
4537,II.,Chundoo's house and clawed her.
4538,II.,
4539,II.,"The room, with its one small window, darkened early. Fâtma put the"
4540,II.,"babies to sleep and went out into the alley to watch, eager to give"
4541,II.,the first words of disaster. After a time she ventured round the
4542,II.,corner. No one. A little farther. No one. Down the next turn. No one
4543,II.,still. Perhaps she had chosen the other way. Back up the now pitchy
4544,II.,stairs to the dim room. No one there save the sleeping babies. Fâtma's
4545,II.,"wrath--cooled, rose again against the loiterer, had time to cool again"
4546,II.,"into dismay. She knew well enough, young as she was, what Meran's"
4547,II.,guidance might mean in the Badami bazar. For all that she waited
4548,II.,"patiently, crouching on the stairs, peering down into the darkness,"
4549,II.,"watching, listening for the shuffling footstep of a veiled"
4550,II.,"woman--watching and waiting stolidly, without fear or blame."
4551,II.,
4552,II.,"Such things were, and neither Peru nor Hoshiaribi counted for much"
4553,II.,with her save as extra appetites for dinner. When ten o'clock chimed
4554,II.,"from the police station gong at the Mori gate, she went back to the"
4555,II.,"room and drew the bolt of the door. All was dark, save where a ray of"
4556,II.,moonlight shone through a chink in the shutter. She stole over to
4557,II.,"this, and, standing in the bar of light, undid a knot in the corner of"
4558,II.,"her veil. One, two, three annas, some pice, and a few cowries."
4559,II.,
4560,II.,"If the worst came to the worst, and Hoshiaribi did not come back, that"
4561,II.,"would buy a ""Maw"" at the gimcrack shop round the corner. So she"
4562,II.,cuddled up on the bed beside the babies contentedly.
4563,II.,
4564,II.,
4565,II.,
4566,III.,III.
4567,III.,
4568,III.,"""_One and one make two--oo--oo,"
4569,III.,"Two and two make four--or--or_."""
4570,III.,
4571,III.,"""That is enough, my daughters,"" said Fâtma, royally. ""Miream and Anna"
4572,III.,will play with Mohammed Ali; Janet and Kareem will take Ahmad Hassan
4573,III.,for a walk down the alley and back again. The rest of you will sit
4574,III.,"still and think how good you are going to be to-morrow."""
4575,III.,
4576,III.,"The little, large-eyed, gentle mites, ranged solemnly behind a row of"
4577,III.,"ink-pots, primers, and writing-boards, did as they were bid"
4578,III.,decorously--for the organization of Mussamat Fâtma's school was
4579,III.,"excellent, its discipline first class. The cleanliness, too, of its"
4580,III.,"primers, its pens, and its writing-boards was quite abnormal. Not"
4581,III.,"because of abnormal neatness, but because none of these things were"
4582,III.,ever used. They were there because that was part of the game of
4583,III.,"school, and Fâtma's school was emphatically a school with the learning"
4584,III.,"left out. To be sure, the pupils chanted their letters, and asserted"
4585,III.,"the gospel that one and one make two all the world over; but, after"
4586,III.,"that, education went down the by-path of learning how to sit still and"
4587,III.,"do as you were bid. Yet somehow the wee girlies liked it well, and"
4588,III.,their busy mothers liked it better still. In that crowded quarter of
4589,III.,"evil repute it was something to have a _crêche_, where for a few hours"
4590,III.,the little ones with a tempting jewel or two were safe from the
4591,III.,avarice of any passer-by. And then Fâtma's pupils gave no trouble at
4592,III.,"home. So the school throve, and though educationally, of course, it"
4593,III.,"was a miserable sham, it gave great satisfaction to all concerned;"
4594,III.,Fâtma finding sufficient payment in the general good-will of her
4595,III.,"neighbours, and the constant relays of nurse-maids she secured. She"
4596,III.,"had plenty of time now for the golden stars; and since Lâlu, the"
4597,III.,"cripple's grandmother, had died, Fâtma not only got full price for the"
4598,III.,"work she did for him, but earned something besides by cooking his"
4599,III.,"bread and doing his marketing when she did her own. An excellent plan,"
4600,III.,"said the neighbours, since Mussumat Fâtma, aged fourteen, was as"
4601,III.,"sedate as a great-grandmother, and poor Lâlu, for all his kind face"
4602,III.,"and clever hands, was not to be reckoned as a possible husband for any"
4603,III.,one. The only thing over which the women shook their heads was this
4604,III.,"lack of a husband for the girl, who, though she was a little crooked"
4605,III.,"perhaps, with hauling those big children up and down stairs, had not,"
4606,III.,"like Lâlu, lost her right to be married. What excuse could that rascal"
4607,III.,Peru offer to his conscience for his neglect of the natural guardian's
4608,III.,"first duty? He, and Chundoo, and Hoshiaribi flaunting away in the"
4609,III.,"Badâmi bazar, were no better than pigs of infidels. It would serve"
4610,III.,"them right if Fâtma were to appeal modestly to the elders, and let"
4611,III.,herself go to a husband for the beggarly five _dumris_ the law
4612,III.,"demands. Then Peru would have to support his boys, and would not even"
4613,III.,get compensation in the price of the bride. But Fâtma herself scouted
4614,III.,"the idea. She had seen enough of husbands, and would never marry. She"
4615,III.,"had her babies and her school; and then there was always Lâlu, who was"
4616,III.,"as wise as any saint, and as good as any father to the boys. She used"
4617,III.,to leave them in his charge when she did her marketing; for this was
4618,III.,"after hours, when her little school-maidens had gone home. And as for"
4619,III.,"Hassan Ahmad, the yellow-legged baby of two years past, if ever he"
4620,III.,"went a-missing, Fâtma knew she would find him cuddled up among Lâlu's"
4621,III.,"helpless legs, watching the gold thread loop itself into dainty"
4622,III.,"patterns very different from her coarse, crooked stars, and listening"
4623,III.,contentedly to Lâlu's musical voice intoning some versicle of the
4624,III.,"Koran. He knew as many as a Moulvi, she used to say proudly; for all"
4625,III.,that she repulsed with scorn his suggestion that she should teach some
4626,III.,to her pupils.
4627,III.,
4628,III.,"""_Ai tobak, Mian_ Lâl Khan! Dost forget mine is 'primary girls'"
4629,III.,school'? It is not a 'missen' or an 'indigenous school.' We do not
4630,III.,"teach such things. Only letters and tables, and such like."""
4631,III.,
4632,III.,She did not care to confess that she herself knew none of the
4633,III.,versicles which even the poorest girl ought to know.
4634,III.,
4635,III.,"""Well, well, perhaps thou art right, Mussumat Fâtma,"" he replied. ""All"
4636,III.,"learning is good."" As he sat at his work he used often to pause and"
4637,III.,"listen with a smile to the chorus of children's voices, insisting on"
4638,III.,"the fact that one and one make two. After all, it did not differ much"
4639,III.,from the creed he had somehow extracted from the sonorous Arabic
4640,III.,"phrases which were so constantly on his lips. What was, was; what"
4641,III.,"would be, would be."
4642,III.,
4643,III.,"Meanwhile life was brighter for him because of Fâtma and the baby,"
4644,III.,"Hassan Ahmad cuddling close to him, and the children's chorus echoing"
4645,III.,up the stairs. It was easier for Fâtma also. When she had closed the
4646,III.,"door at ten o'clock one night, nearly two years ago, and counted out"
4647,III.,"the money in order to buy a ""Maw,"" she had thought of nothing but the"
4648,III.,"immediate morrow. Now, when she barred it, she closed it deliberately"
4649,III.,"against all interference. Peru, at first, had come prowling round to"
4650,III.,"see how matters went, and Hoshiaribi had sent inquiries from the"
4651,III.,Badami bazar. Fâtma had given both a cool reception. She was quite
4652,III.,"happy, quite content. The babies did not belong to those _budzarts_;"
4653,III.,"they belonged to her. So, by degrees, they had left her to her own"
4654,III.,"devices, and for the last year she had seen or heard nothing of them."
4655,III.,
4656,III.,It was a stifling afternoon in August. The dry heat which had baked
4657,III.,"into the bricks with the June sun, had boiled out of them again with"
4658,III.,"the scanty rain of July into a sort of sodden vapour, like the hot"
4659,III.,breath of some evil creature. The alley smelled horribly. Even the
4660,III.,inhabitants spat as they emerged from the dark drain of a tenement
4661,III.,"stair, which all the sweeping in the world could not keep clean. The"
4662,III.,"very water spilled on it, as the woman carried the _chatties_ full to"
4663,III.,"their rooms, seemed to dissolve the dirt and give it greater freedom."
4664,III.,When those on the ground-floor sprinkled the entry for the sake of
4665,III.,"coolness, the stench rose to the roof. And in and out the highways and"
4666,III.,"byways of the city cholera played pranks with the people--here to-day,"
4667,III.,"gone tomorrow; biding its time, till on some steamy, dull morning folk"
4668,III.,would wake to find it in earnest.
4669,III.,
4670,III.,"""The sickness was at Haiyatun's yesterday,"" Râjjun would say to"
4671,III.,"Fâjjan; ""it took the cousin who came from Umritsur. The police were"
4672,III.,burning clothes and sulphur as I went by this morning. It is tyranny
4673,III.,"when the Lord is over all."""
4674,III.,
4675,III.,"""Yea, and they carried Mai Jeswant's man to the hospital, and the"
4676,III.,"doctors never left him, but he died all the same. Look you, 'tis God's"
4677,III.,"will."""
4678,III.,
4679,III.,And the two women grinding at the mill ground on. The one might be
4680,III.,"taken and the other left before the day was out, but the meal was"
4681,III.,wanted for the survivors' supper. People all over the world die
4682,III.,"silently from pluck, or pride, or piety; but not all of them die as"
4683,III.,"these do, casting no shadow of blame either on the heaven above or on"
4684,III.,"the earth beneath. One has to go to civilized lands, and to a people"
4685,III.,"who profess a faith which proclaims its triumph over the grave, before"
4686,III.,we find the fear of infection producing a selfish panic.
4687,III.,
4688,III.,"Fâtma, having attended the Central school during an epidemic, had"
4689,III.,views on sanitary subjects and the procedure due to the dignity of a
4690,III.,"primary school. She fumigated her maidens solemnly with sulphur, she"
4691,III.,"had covers to the water-pots, and confiscated melon-rinds with the"
4692,III.,utmost rigour. This proved a vast amusement to the squatting circle.
4693,III.,
4694,III.,"""_Ari, Muallama!_"" would come a little pipe. ""Juntu hath a bit of"
4695,III.,"pumpkin in her veil; I saw it."""
4696,III.,
4697,III.,"Then would ensue a sort of hunt the slipper, beset for each with"
4698,III.,"delicious tremors, lest, after all, the contraband morsel should be"
4699,III.,"found in your possession; until some one, seized by shyness or sudden"
4700,III.,"virtue, would give it up to be burned."
4701,III.,
4702,III.,"Fâtma, on a sultry August afternoon, had just been playing the part"
4703,III.,"of grand inquisitor over a gnawed fragment of cucumber, when a big"
4704,III.,"heavy-browed woman pushed her way unceremoniously into the room, and"
4705,III.,sat down on the bed with an air of possession. It was Chundoo. Fâtma
4706,III.,"had last seen her gossiping on the palazzo steps, and something told"
4707,III.,"the girl the visit boded no good. Her heart gave a throb, her usual"
4708,III.,courage seemed to leave her.
4709,III.,
4710,III.,"""So this is thy school,"" began her sister-in-law. ""Lord, what a farce!"
4711,III.,But that is over. I have come for thee because thy wedding is settled
4712,III.,"at last. The dates will be brought to-morrow, so thou hadst as well"
4713,III.,"return with me to-night. 'Twill save trouble."""
4714,III.,
4715,III.,The studiously careless tone of undoubted authority had its effect.
4716,III.,There was nothing incredible in it. Marriage in Fâtma's world meant
4717,III.,coercion. She had seen most of her contemporaries handed over to a
4718,III.,husband without even a pretence of consulting their wishes.
4719,III.,
4720,III.,"""I--I--want no husband,"" she faltered, utterly taken aback."
4721,III.,
4722,III.,Chundoo laughed--a nasty laugh.
4723,III.,
4724,III.,"""_Wah illah!_ So girls say ever. 'Tis pretty behaviour, and thou hast"
4725,III.,"said it. The thing is settled."""
4726,III.,
4727,III.,"""By Peru?"" asked the girl, quickly."
4728,III.,
4729,III.,"""By Peru; who else? Look you, the scoundrel is in jail. Nay, why"
4730,III.,"shouldst start? It was his appointed end, and serve him right, wasting"
4731,III.,"my substance to a shadow. He robbed a peasant in the _serai_, treating"
4732,III.,"him with liquor, after '_Englis fassen_.' Well, he is there for two"
4733,III.,"years, and hath repented him of the evil and bethought him of his"
4734,III.,"duty. So I have found thee a husband--honourable, if somewhat old. But"
4735,III.,"thou, God knows, art a grandmother, so that matters not. And he can"
4736,III.,"afford to pay for a young wife, and keep her in plenty. So send these"
4737,III.,"brats away, and the woman I have downstairs will take them to"
4738,III.,"Hoshiaribi. Their father being in jail, they are her charge, not mine."
4739,III.,"Come, chicken, there is no time to lose."""
4740,III.,
4741,III.,She laid her hand on the girl's arm as Fâtma stood stupidly staring at
4742,III.,"her. The touch seemed to make her realize the situation, for she"
4743,III.,darted with a cry to where her babies sat in the charge of the first
4744,III.,class.
4745,III.,
4746,III.,"Perhaps the little nurses, gazing with that stolid, wide-eyed dislike"
4747,III.,"at the strange woman who spoke so roughly to their teacher, thought"
4748,III.,that the latter sought their protection. They gave it anyhow. In a
4749,III.,"second, Chundoo was surrounded by a mob of twenty mites, full of"
4750,III.,"shrill cries and ineffectual beatings of tiny hands--ineffectual, till"
4751,III.,"the tiniest, giving way to the natural Eve, slipped down and"
4752,III.,"deliberately bit the enemy in the calf. Chundoo, yelling with pain,"
4753,III.,"slapped right and left. Fâtma, her fear gone before this attack on her"
4754,III.,"pupils, flew to the rescue. Such a scene had not been enacted within"
4755,III.,those walls for two years. Before five minutes passed even the stairs
4756,III.,were blocked by infuriated mothers.
4757,III.,
4758,III.,"When Chundoo had been dragged off the Kôtwal, followed by half the"
4759,III.,"matrons in the alley, Fâtma sat down, dazed and dry-eyed, between her"
4760,III.,two charges. That bite had saved her; she would not have to go that
4761,III.,"evening, perhaps not even to-morrow. But afterwards? Girls had to be"
4762,III.,"married, and Peru could marry her to any one he chose. Even the"
4763,III.,"neighbours, when they heard about the husband, would side against her."
4764,III.,And it would be of no use to beg mercy of Peru in jail. That was the
4765,III.,very reason why they had thought of marrying her. The money would be
4766,III.,"useful to keep Chundoo comfortable, and yet she would not be bothered"
4767,III.,"with the boys, as she would have been had Peru been free. Now"
4768,III.,"Hoshiaribi, their mother, must keep them, but Chundoo would get the"
4769,III.,"dowry. What did it matter who got it, if she must marry?--and if Peru"
4770,III.,"said she must, she must. There was no help; even the neighbours would"
4771,III.,side against her.
4772,III.,
4773,III.,A rapping on the floor above reminded her that she had forgotten
4774,III.,Lâlu's dinner. Poor Lâlu! Who would look after him when she was gone?
4775,III.,"Drearily and still dry-eyed, she hitched the two-year-old on her hip,"
4776,III.,and with a pile of dough-cakes and pease porridge in her hand toiled
4777,III.,"up the stair behind Hassan Ahmad, who climbed the high brick steps on"
4778,III.,"all-fours, slowly, methodically."
4779,III.,
4780,III.,"It was almost dark in the room above, and Lâlu's voice came kindly"
4781,III.,from a shadowy corner.
4782,III.,
4783,III.,"""Trouble no further, Mussumat Fâtma. I was loath to knock, yet knew"
4784,III.,thou wouldst be vexed to forget. Set the food down--so. Sure thou hast
4785,III.,"enough to-day without my service."""
4786,III.,
4787,III.,"She gave way to tears then, and crouched down on the floor suddenly,"
4788,III.,"an image of forlorn, crushing grief."
4789,III.,
4790,III.,"""O Lâlu, Lâlu! Peru is going to marry me, and what will become of my"
4791,III.,school? And what will become of my babies? And what will become of
4792,III.,"you, O Lâlu?"""
4793,III.,
4794,III.,"Hassan Ahmad had toddled over to the cripple's helpless knee, and"
4795,III.,"Mohammed Ali, half asleep, buried his head on the girl's thin breast."
4796,III.,"There was no sound in the room save her sobbing, and a passing rustle"
4797,III.,as if something in the shadows had tried to move and sank back to the
4798,III.,old position again. After a time the response came feebly:
4799,III.,
4800,III.,"""_Ai_, my sister, cry not. Marriage is good. It is the Lord's will,"
4801,III.,"and Peru hath the right."""
4802,III.,
4803,III.,Perhaps for the first time the cripple hesitated in his creed. To say
4804,III.,"sooth, it seemed odd to put Peru on the Lord's side."
4805,III.,
4806,III.,"""Yes, he hath the right. Therefore I cry, Lâlu. Is there nothing to be"
4807,III.,"done, Lâlu? Canst thou not help at all?"""
4808,III.,
4809,III.,"Lâlu, in the shadows, looked down at his dexterous hands, then covered"
4810,III.,his face with them. They were good for nothing else. A girl must marry
4811,III.,"where she was bidden, and even had the rest of him been as face and"
4812,III.,"hands, there would have been nothing to be done, nothing to be said."
4813,III.,"What chance had a cripple, a girl, and two babies, against the will of"
4814,III.,"the Lord represented by law backed up by principalities and powers, by"
4815,III.,"custom and chief courts, by wisdom and civilization?"
4816,III.,
4817,III.,"""Cry not, my sister, cry not. Marriage is honourable in all."""
4818,III.,
4819,III.,So by degrees Fâtma's sobs ceased before the inevitable.
4820,III.,
4821,III.,"""Come, Hassan Ahmad,"" she cried; ""it grows late. 'Tis time for sleep."""
4822,III.,
4823,III.,"""He sleeps already,"" replied the voice from the shadows; ""'twere pity"
4824,III.,"to wake him, sister."""
4825,III.,
4826,III.,"""I will carry Mohammed Ali first and then come back."" Her old decision"
4827,III.,and motherliness showed even through her utter dejection.
4828,III.,
4829,III.,Lâlu gathered the boy closer and half mechanically hummed the chorus
4830,III.,"he had so often heard Fâtma use as a lullaby. Yes, one and one made"
4831,III.,"two, and two and two made four. But only if God willed it so; not"
4832,III.,otherwise.
4833,III.,
4834,III.,"""Stoop down, little mother, and I will lift the boy to thee,"" he said,"
4835,III.,"when Fâtma, feeling her way through the dark, paused as her fingers"
4836,III.,touched Lâlu's knee. She felt his fine hands linger as he drew them
4837,III.,from the burden he laid in her arms--linger almost caressingly.
4838,III.,
4839,III.,"""One and one, and two and two, are what He chooses to make them."
4840,III.,"Remember that, my sister."""
4841,III.,
4842,III.,"""Not so, Lâlu. In school they are ever the same. The big teacher said"
4843,III.,"so. One and one is two all the world over."""
4844,III.,
4845,III.,"He sighed, sitting crouched up in the dark; then he called after her,"
4846,III.,"""Peace go with thee, Mussumat Fâtma."""
4847,III.,
4848,III.,"""And peace be thine, Lâlu,"" echoed back from the stairs."
4849,III.,
4850,III.,The next morning the whole alley was being censed. A group of
4851,III.,policemen were standing round a bonfire of beds and clothes over which
4852,III.,the flames licked blue and clear as the brimstone was scattered on it.
4853,III.,
4854,III.,"Fâtma's room was empty, so was Lâlu's. So were several others in the"
4855,III.,high pestilential tenements of the quarter. The cholera had grown
4856,III.,tired of playing at school. It had taken arithmetic and education and
4857,III.,creeds and customs all into its own hands and settled the problem its
4858,III.,"own way. Two and two were not four, but none; and only Chundoo called"
4859,III.,Heaven to witness that she had been defrauded of the remuneration
4860,III.,justly due to those who possess a marriageable female relation. The
4861,III.,rest of the neighbours said it was God's will.
4862,III.,
4863,III.,
4864,III.,
4865,III.,
4866,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,IN A CITRON GARDEN.
4867,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
4868,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
4869,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,This is a very idle tale--only the record of five minutes in a citron
4870,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"garden. Not a terraced patch set like a puzzle with toy trees, such as"
4871,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"one sees on the Riviera, but a vast scented shade, unpruned by greed"
4872,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"of gain, where sweet limes, mandarins, shaddocks, and blood-oranges"
4873,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,blended flower and fruit and leaf into one all-sufficing shelter from
4874,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"the sun. There are many such gardens in India, lingering round the"
4875,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,ruined palaces or tombs of bygone kings. This particular one hid in
4876,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"its perfumed heart a white marble mausoleum, where the red and green"
4877,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,parrots inlaid themselves like mosaic among the tracery. For they
4878,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"are decorative birds, and, being untrammelled by prejudice regarding"
4879,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"the position of their heads, lend themselves to many a graceful,"
4880,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"topsy-turvy pattern. Girding the garden was a wall twenty feet high,"
4881,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"bastioned like a fort, but, despite its thickness, crumbling here and"
4882,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"there from sheer old age; invisible, too, for all its height from"
4883,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"within, by reason of the tall thickets of wild lemon on its inner"
4884,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"edge. Four broad alleys, sentinelled by broken fountains, converged to"
4885,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"the mausoleum, high above a marble reservoir where the water still"
4886,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"lingered, hiding its stagnation beneath a carpet of lotus-leaves. From"
4887,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"these, again, narrower paths mapped the garden into squares, each"
4888,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,concealed by the dense foliage from the next. It was a maze of shadowy
4889,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,ways edged by little runnels of water and bordered by roses and
4890,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"jasmine, with here and there a huge white dræcena usurping the path."
4891,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"Day and night the water ran clear and cool, to flood each square in"
4892,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"turn, till it showed a shining lake, wherein the roof of fruit and"
4893,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,blossom lay reflected as in a mirror.
4894,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
4895,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"A Garden of Eden; like it, tenanted by a woman and a snake; famous,"
4896,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"also, for its forbidden fruit."
4897,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
4898,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,Nowhere did shaddocks grow so regardless of possible danger to the
4899,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,world. The green-gold globes weighed the branches to the ground; the
4900,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"massive flowers burdened the air with perfume. For all their solid,"
4901,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"somewhat stolid look, they are fragile flowers. Gather a spray as"
4902,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"gently as you can, and only the buds remain; the perfect flower has"
4903,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"fallen. So, in a citron garden it is well to purge the soul from"
4904,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"""_karma_"" or desire, in order to reach the ""_nirvana_"" of content in"
4905,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,which--so say the Buddhists--lies the full perfection of possession.
4906,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
4907,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"Naraini, the gardener's granddaughter, had different views. She stood,"
4908,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"at the beginning of the five minutes, beneath a citron-tree. One"
4909,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"dimpled brown hand held the branch above her, and, as she swayed her"
4910,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"body to and fro leisurely, the flowers dropped into her stretched"
4911,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"veil. She was not unlike a citron-blossom herself. Like them, arrayed"
4912,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"boldly in saffron and white; like them, looking the world in the face"
4913,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"with calm consciousness that she was worth a look in return. Finally,"
4914,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"her world was theirs--that is to say, these few acres of scented"
4915,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"shade. As yet Naraini knew no other, though the next day she was to"
4916,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,leave it and her childhood in order to follow the unknown bridegroom
4917,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,to whom she had been married for twelve years.
4918,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
4919,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"The incessant throbbing of a tom-tom, the occasional blare of a"
4920,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,horrible horn in the ruined arcade which was all that remained of a
4921,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"royal rest-house, proclaimed that the marriage festivities were even"
4922,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,now going on beyond the crumbling walls. From all this Naraini being
4923,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"necessarily excluded, she had spent the morning in receiving the"
4924,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"female visitors with simulated tears, in order to impress them"
4925,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"with her admirable culture; thereinafter relapsing, with them, to"
4926,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,shrill-voiced feminine chatter until the heat of noon stilled even the
4927,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"women's tongues. Then, driven by an odd unrest, she had slipped away"
4928,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,to the cool alleys she knew so well; even there busying herself with
4929,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"preparations, since the flowers she gathered would be needed to strew"
4930,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"the bridal bed. It was no new task. Every year an old distiller came,"
4931,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"in blossom-time, to set up his still beside the well. Then, in the"
4932,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"dewy dawns, she and the old grandmother beat down the blossoms, and"
4933,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,when sunset brought respite from the heat Naraini used to watch while
4934,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"the flowers were crushed into the pan, and luted down with clay as if"
4935,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,into a grave. And a grave it was to beauty. The first time she saw the
4936,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,yellow mash which was left after the sweetness had trickled into the
4937,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"odd assortment of bottles the old distiller brought with him, she had"
4938,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,cried bitterly. But a whole bottle of orange-flower water as her very
4939,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"own had been consoling, and the fact that the label proclaimed her"
4940,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"treasure to be ""_Genuine, Old, Unsweetened Gin_"" did not disturb her"
4941,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,ignorance.
4942,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
4943,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"Every year afterwards the old man had given her another bottle, and as"
4944,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"she had always chosen a fresh label, she had quite an assortment of"
4945,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"them in the shed which served her as a play-room. And now, being"
4946,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"nearly sixteen, she was about to leave other things besides that row"
4947,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"of bottles labelled ""_Encore_,"" ""_Dry Monopole_,"" ""_Heidsiecker_,"" and"
4948,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"""_Chloric Ether Bitters!_"""
4949,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
4950,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,She was not alarmed. She had taken a peep at her future husband that
4951,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,morning and satisfied herself that he had the requisite number of
4952,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"eyes, legs, and arms. For the rest, men were kind to pretty girls, and"
4953,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,she knew herself to be a very pretty girl. It is hard to convey any
4954,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"impression of the girl's state of mind to English ears, simply because"
4955,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,marriage had never been presented to her as an occasion for personal
4956,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,choice. She had been happy hitherto; the possession of a husband ought
4957,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"to increase that happiness, if Fate sent her a pleasant mother-in-law."
4958,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"The man himself was a trifle, since men were always kind to pretty"
4959,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"girls. That, formulated so plainly as to rob it of all offence, was"
4960,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,Naraini's first and last argument for content.
4961,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
4962,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"As she stood swaying in the shadow, some one came down the alley. She"
4963,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,recognized him at once. It was the bridegroom; and the demon of
4964,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"mischief, which enters into Eastern girlhood as causelessly as it does"
4965,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"into Western, suggested that she had him at an advantage. He had not"
4966,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,seen her since she was three years old--could not possibly recognize
4967,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"her. Besides, what brought him there? An intolerable curiosity,"
4968,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"mingled with a pleasant conviction, made her stand her ground. Perhaps"
4969,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,she knew that the spot occupied by her was the only one visible from
4970,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"the roof of the arcade, and drew her own conclusions. Perhaps she did"
4971,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"not. It was true nevertheless, and the bridegroom, having caught a"
4972,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"glimpse of something attractive, had taken advantage of the general"
4973,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,sleepiness to climb over the ruined wall for a closer view; for he was
4974,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"of those who are very kind indeed to pretty faces. He, it must be"
4975,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"remembered, had caught no consolatory glimpse of his bride. People"
4976,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"told him she was beautiful, but that was always said: but here was"
4977,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"undoubted good looks; so, despite his wedding-day on the morrow, he"
4978,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,slipped into the citron garden intent on a lark. No more refined word
4979,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,expresses his mood so clearly.
4980,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
4981,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"Naraini, however, neither shrieked nor giggled at the sight of a"
4982,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"stranger. She simply drew her veil closer, and went on gathering"
4983,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"citron-blossoms. He paused, uncertain of everything save her"
4984,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"entrancing grace. Was she only a servant, or did he run risks in"
4985,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"venturing closer? Naraini, meanwhile, behind her veil, gurgled with"
4986,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"soft laughter, pleased at being able to test the value of her beauty"
4987,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,on the man she meant to rule by it. So they stood--she in the shadow
4988,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"at one end of the alley, he in the shadow at the other; between them"
4989,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,the scented path bordered by the runnels of water slipping by to bring
4990,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,a deluge to some portion of that little world. Some might have called
4991,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"it a pretty scene, instinct with the joy of youth; others might have"
4992,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"turned their heads away, praying to be delivered from the world, the"
4993,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"flesh, and the devil. Naraini thought of nothing save her own"
4994,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,laughter.
4995,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
4996,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"The garden seemed asleep save for those two, as, with the cruelty of a"
4997,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"chase waking in him, as in a cat stalking a mouse, the cruelty of"
4998,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"success waking in her as in a snake charming a bird, the distance"
4999,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,between them lessened.
5000,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5001,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"Suddenly, with a burst of high, childish laughter, the veil full of"
5002,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"citron-blossoms was flung in his face, and Naraini was off down the"
5003,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"alleys, while he, with anger added to admiration, was after her."
5004,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5005,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"The walls echoed to the soft thud of their flying feet--down one path,"
5006,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"up another, round by the tomb, scaring the parrots to a screaming"
5007,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"wheel. Confident in her superior knowledge, she paused on the topmost"
5008,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"step, ere scudding across the causeway, to fling back a handful of"
5009,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,flowers lingering in a fold. He set his teeth hard. If she tried short
5010,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"cuts, so could he; and he was round the next square so fast, that she"
5011,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"gave a little shriek and dived into the thickest part of the garden,"
5012,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"whither the water was flowing, and where the beasts and birds and"
5013,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"creeping things innumerable found a cool, damp refuge. His blood was"
5014,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"up--the jade must be caught and kissed, if only in revenge! The"
5015,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,flutter of her saffron skirt at the opposite side of a square made him
5016,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,try strategy. He crept into the thickest undergrowth and waited.
5017,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5018,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"Something else waited, not a footfall off, but he did not see it. His"
5019,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"eyes were on that saffron flutter, pausing, advancing, retreating,"
5020,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"pausing again. Naraini had lost the bearings of her pursuer, and, like"
5021,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"a child playing ""I spy,"" was on the alert for a surprise."
5022,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5023,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"Suddenly came a cry as she caught sight of him, a shout as he bounded"
5024,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"out; both lost in a yell arresting her flight and his, as if it had"
5025,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,turned them to stone. He stood with the wide nostrils and fixed eyes
5026,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"of ghastly fear, clinging for support to the branch above him, whence"
5027,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,the flowers fell pattering to the ground. On his ankle two spots of
5028,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"blood, bright against the brown skin. Across the path a big, black"
5029,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"rope of a thing, curving swiftly to the roses beyond."
5030,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5031,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"""Snake! snake!"""

5033,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"Her cry echoed his, as she ran back to him; but he struck at her with"
5034,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,clenched hand.
5035,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5036,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"""Go, woman--she-devil! Thou hast killed me. Curse thee! oh, curse thee"
5037,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"for beguiling me! It has bitten me. Holy Gunga, I am dead! and I was"
5038,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"the bridegroom. 'Tis thy fault. I was the bridegroom."" He had sunk to"
5039,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"the ground clasping his ankle, and rocked himself backward and"
5040,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"forward, moaning and shuddering in impotent fear. Naraini stood by"
5041,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"him. There was no hope: the big, black rope of a thing did its work"
5042,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"well; yet, even so, anger was her first thought."
5043,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5044,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"""It was a lie! 'Tis not my fault! Why didst come? Why didst follow?"
5045,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"And if thou art the bridegroom, was not I the bride?"" Then something"
5046,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,leaped to memory. She threw her hands above her head and beat them
5047,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,wildly in passionate despair and horror.
5048,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5049,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"""He is dead! he is dead! And I am the bride."""
5050,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5051,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"The words rang through the garden, and pierced even his grovelling"

5054,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5055,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"""The bride? Then the widow! my widow! Thou hast killed me, but thou"

5057,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5058,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"His face was terrible in its fear, its regret, its revenge. She fought"
5059,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"against him desperately, but his hands held fast, shifting to her"

5061,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"crouched silent, like a young animal terrified into acquiescence."
5062,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5063,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"""Thou shalt see me die--'tis thy fault--thou shalt see me die!"" he"
5064,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,muttered again and again.
5065,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5066,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"So they sat side by side in the grip of death, his head on her bosom,"

5070,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"The sun-flecks shifted over them, the citron-flowers fell upon them as"

5073,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"body, lying with its face of desire and disgust hidden in her lap."
5074,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5075,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,She was a widow. The citron-blossom had fallen.
5076,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5077,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,That night there was weeping and wailing instead of feasting in the

5080,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"victim, it might seek a pair. Perhaps, as far as happiness goes, it"
5081,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,might as well have claimed Naraini also.
5082,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,
5083,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"After a time, to be sure, life went on as before. The old distiller"
5084,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,"came, and Naraini shook the blossoms for him into her widow's shroud."
5085,IN A CITRON GARDEN.,The sweetness of them was no less sweet as it trickled into the old

5307,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],dawn found us stealing along

5310,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],
5311,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"Well, we made for the river, through tamarisk jungle"

5313,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],And narrow-pathed tangle of _jhau_ that would scarce
5314,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"let a buffalo pass,"

5320,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"'Twas a broad, yellow plain, shining far in the rays"

5328,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],
5329,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],Then we looked at each other in silence; the looks

5331,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"But I thought of that challenge of Fuzla's, and"
5332,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"made up my mind I would go,"
5333,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"Though I knew that the odds were against me; so,"
5334,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"bidding the cowards turn back,"
5335,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],With a few of the beasts on their traces and try hard

5337,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],
5338,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"For 'twas time, it was time that I wanted--I drove"

5340,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],But the brutes wouldn't take to the water; they
5341,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],loved life too well not to shrink.
5342,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"So I took a young calf from its mother--'twas cruel,"
5343,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],but what did I reck?
5344,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"And butchered the brute with my hanger, and"
5345,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"fastened my _pug_ round its neck,"
5346,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],
5347,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"Then I dragged it right into the water, and buoyed"

5349,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],With a bundle of grasses and reeds that would keep
5350,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],the dead body afloat.
5351,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],I thought of that challenge of Fuzla's; then turned
5352,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"and struck out like a man,"
5353,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"While the mother leaped after her young one, and"
5354,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],all the rest followed the van.
5355,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],
5356,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"The flood swept me down like a leaf, and the calf"
5357,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"swept me farther down still,"
5358,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"But I knew 'twas a life or death struggle, and"
5359,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],breasted the stream with a will;
5360,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"While the hope I could lead the beasts on, till 'twas"
5361,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"safer before than behind,"
5362,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"And the fear lest Mian Fuzla should win, were the"
5363,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],only two thoughts in my mind.
5364,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],
5365,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],It was half a yard forward to half a mile
5366,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"downward, yet still I made way,"
5367,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"While behind, in a long single file, the black heads of"

5369,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"Till I knew we had reached the big stream, and that"

5371,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"Then I gave one faint shout, and I cast off the dead"
5372,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"calf, and let myself slack."
5373,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],
5374,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"So we drifted, and drifted, and drifted. I strove to"
5375,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"recover my breath,"
5376,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"But a numbness came over my heart, and I knew I"
5377,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"was drifting to death,"
5378,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"As the big, heavy beasts were swept past by the"
5379,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"terrible force of the stream,"
5380,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"And the whole world seemed slipping away, as I"
5381,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],swam on alone in a dream.
5382,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],
5383,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"Then I wondered how Fuzla would take it, and how"
5384,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],many miles I had come;
5385,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],Or guessed what the people would say when days
5386,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],passed and I never came home--
5387,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"Till it came to me, as in a dream, that the current"
5388,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],was setting in shore;
5389,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"And after that, _sahib_, it is strange I could never"
5390,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],recall any more.
5391,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],
5392,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"Only this I can tell you: we measured it after, from"
5393,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"starting to end,"
5394,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"And the distance was over ten miles by the straight,"
5395,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],without counting the bend.
5396,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],So Mian Fuzla was beat; and sent me a _pugri_ with
5397,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"knots which his women had tied,"
5398,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"And the song of the ""Crossing of Shurfu"" is known"
5399,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],through the whole countryside.
5400,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],
5401,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"_Wâh! illâh!_ How my tongue has been wagging, and"
5402,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],I the _zaildâr!_ But in sooth
5403,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],'Tis dull work for old Shurfu compared to the
5404,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"merry, mad days of his youth."
5405,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"_Ji salaam!_ And whatever you want, send for Shurfu"
5406,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],"the _zaildâr_; and, _sahib_,"
5407,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],You'll remember that Fuzla once met with his match
5408,SHURFU THE ZAILDAR[13],on this side of Chenâb!
