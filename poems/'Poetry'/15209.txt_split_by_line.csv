74,MOTHER'S PRAYER,Go before them and let light from above
75,MOTHER'S PRAYER,make their pathway bright. Come into their hearts

85,LET THERE BE PEACE,
86,LET THERE BE PEACE,
87,LET THERE BE PEACE,"Let there be peace, let clouds and storm roll past,"
88,LET THERE BE PEACE,And budding groves burst forth in little leaves.
89,LET THERE BE PEACE,When April showers flush the brooks and eaves;
90,LET THERE BE PEACE,May gardens grow and wheat go flowing fast.
91,LET THERE BE PEACE,"Let there be peace on earth, that men may cast"
92,LET THERE BE PEACE,Their hatreds far away and gather sheaves
93,LET THERE BE PEACE,Of golden days in patterns justice weaves;
94,LET THERE BE PEACE,"That sunset hours may glow with love at last,"
95,LET THERE BE PEACE,"The atmosphere be filled with faith and light,"
96,LET THERE BE PEACE,"No war, nor bombs, no words of discontent."
97,LET THERE BE PEACE,"Let there be peace on every hill and plain,"
98,LET THERE BE PEACE,"That men may live and toil with hearts alight,"
99,LET THERE BE PEACE,That each may aid his brother in content.
100,LET THERE BE PEACE,Let grasses grow and flowers bloom again.

108,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,"Remaining staunchly there in shriveled earth,"
109,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,"The canna stood serene, refreshed by dew"
110,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,"That silently, each cooling night anew"
111,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,Spread living gems to sparkle in their mirth.
112,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,"Beneath, the bulb lay proving well its birth--"
113,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,"A shower passed, the funnel leaves caught true--"
114,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,The plant awoke with life and beauty too.
115,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,And not a drop was wasted of the worth!
116,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,
117,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,"The bud refrained from coming into bloom,"
118,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,"As though it waited for the lusty rain,"
119,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,With low leaves dried and drooping to the ground.
120,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,What is this wisdom in all nature's room
121,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,"That fights to live and grow, and not in vain,"
122,WHAT IS THIS WISDOM,"But God, whose strength in all things may be found."

131,SOLDIER TRAINS,Soldier trains.
132,SOLDIER TRAINS,"Ever droning, jarring, roaring on the rails"
133,SOLDIER TRAINS,Through the amber lights of dawn.
134,SOLDIER TRAINS,Hear them rolling right along
135,SOLDIER TRAINS,"Now acoming and now gone,"
136,SOLDIER TRAINS,"Iron wheel follows wheel,"
137,SOLDIER TRAINS,Round the bend of the river going strong.
138,SOLDIER TRAINS,
139,SOLDIER TRAINS,They are taking our brave soldier boys
140,SOLDIER TRAINS,To the barracks. Hear the thumping of the drums
141,SOLDIER TRAINS,"How they beat and beat and beat,"
142,SOLDIER TRAINS,"In the morning and at night,"
143,SOLDIER TRAINS,"Hear the tramping, marching feet,"
144,SOLDIER TRAINS,All in line stepping fine
145,SOLDIER TRAINS,Hear the praying from the firesides down the street.
146,SOLDIER TRAINS,
147,SOLDIER TRAINS,"Hear the roaring of the trains,"
148,SOLDIER TRAINS,Speeding trains
149,SOLDIER TRAINS,With the rumbling. Shouting home-boys off to war!
150,SOLDIER TRAINS,Now they travel to far shores.
151,SOLDIER TRAINS,"See them waving their good-byes,"
152,SOLDIER TRAINS,There's the girl that Joe adores
153,SOLDIER TRAINS,"Waving hand, smiling band!"
154,SOLDIER TRAINS,Hear the laughter from the windows and the doors.

163,DEAR POSSESSIONS,"With a roof that shelters and a restful bed,"
164,DEAR POSSESSIONS,A place to wear the faded silk
165,DEAR POSSESSIONS,And a pillow for the aching head;

167,DEAR POSSESSIONS,"A kettle that sings while the night wind sighs,"
168,DEAR POSSESSIONS,And a cup of tea to drink;

181,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,
182,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,
183,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,Glad tears that rush like rivers down the cheek
184,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,Like gilding gold of morning's amber light.
185,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,"O happy hearts, by hearths when wills are meek!"
186,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,We welcome sun that chased away the night.
187,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,The weeping eyes will not acknowledge hate.
188,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,"When lovers meet forgiven after pain,"
189,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,"Tears cleanse the heart and mind of fire and mote,"
190,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,And freshen countenance and bleach the stain.
191,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,"O rain of peace, that washes doubt away,"
192,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,And casts a burden from the heart and home.
193,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,Sad hearts in joy united on this day;
194,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,Now buds will bloom again in garden loam.
195,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,Glad tears that come unbidden thus and free
196,THE UNBIDDEN TEARS,Have banished care and brought you back to me.

202,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,
203,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,
204,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,"Today resplendent in red, grays and gold,"
205,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,"No wind disturbs the calm of Winter's rest,"
206,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,But quiet and serene on earth's broad breast
207,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,Is shrub and bush and seed in loamy hold;
208,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,"The buds on elm are waiting to unfold,"
209,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,Our biddie hen wears crimson on her crest.
210,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,"This gorgeous day, when children laugh and jest,"
211,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,And run and dance and not a thought withhold.
212,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,
213,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,For Winter's frost was gone at early noon.
214,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,We know that Spring will come on southern breeze;
215,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,The grass will green and roses bloom again.
216,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,"We love the flowers, summer warmth and boon,"
217,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,"O joy of earth, in green and swaying trees,"
218,THE PROMISE OF SPRING,In buds and bees on this broad prairie plain.

224,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,
225,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,
226,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,O hallowed charm of long departed days;
227,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,The good and bad blend in a sparkling stream.
228,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,If one recalls youth's glad and care free ways;
229,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,"The distant roar of music is supreme,"
230,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,When viewing life's almost forgotten trail.
231,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,There is a stream that twines its way about
232,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,"Through shady spots, by broken, rotted rail."
233,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,"The falling water glitters, and the trout,"
234,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,"Again, like precious memories, flash and dart."
235,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,"Through bleak and cold, a precipice once crossed"
236,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,Still fills with pride and pain the aging heart;
237,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,"For time has now the thorns and rocks embossed,"
238,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,"And thus the long dead past is always bright,"
239,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,For those whose sun is sinking into night.
240,THE DAYS LIVE AGAIN,

250,ROLLING TRUCKS,Caring naught for fame or wage;
251,ROLLING TRUCKS,"Rolling trucks for Uncle Sam,"
252,ROLLING TRUCKS,In his kit are bread and ham.
253,ROLLING TRUCKS,Slipping over moon-lit dunes
254,ROLLING TRUCKS,Humming low the old men's tunes.
255,ROLLING TRUCKS,"Every moment plays the game,"
256,ROLLING TRUCKS,Like an iron in a flame.

266,AT DUSK,"A low blue cloud lies stretched beyond the trees,"
267,AT DUSK,"All quiet so. The chant of birds uplifts,"
268,AT DUSK,"And through the evening dusk a tremor sifts,"
269,AT DUSK,"The chill of night creeps close with turning keys,"
270,AT DUSK,"And darkness soothes each child. The daylight flees,"
271,AT DUSK,"Though many voices lend their artful gifts,"
272,AT DUSK,And mingle with the city's murmured rifts.
273,AT DUSK,"While twilight covers all with mysteries,"
274,AT DUSK,There is the roll of train or army truck;
275,AT DUSK,A mother calls her three year old within.
276,AT DUSK,The most of us preparing for the night;
277,AT DUSK,"Some go their way to labor for their luck,"
278,AT DUSK,And others toil that we may rest or spin.
279,AT DUSK,God guards the whole until the morning light.

287,THE MORNING,"The morning freshened with the dew of night,"
288,THE MORNING,Was glad with crowing cock and singing bird;
289,THE MORNING,And through the mists came hope and kindly word.
290,THE MORNING,The east aglow with early amber light.
291,THE MORNING,As perking coffee roused the hungry sprite;
292,THE MORNING,"Beside the hearth a friendly pussy purred,"
293,THE MORNING,"And in a crib a blue-eyed baby stirred,"
294,THE MORNING,Awakened from sweet slumber of the night.
295,THE MORNING,O dawning! Here with all her usual charm.
296,THE MORNING,"Another day to toil for child and friend,"
297,THE MORNING,"One hour to praise our God, while hatreds ebbed;"
298,THE MORNING,To hope and live and succor from all harm
299,THE MORNING,"Those weaker ones who know not how to fend,"
300,THE MORNING,And cast a beam that lights their way ahead.
