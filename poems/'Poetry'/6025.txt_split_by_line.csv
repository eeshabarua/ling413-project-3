131,THE ENGLISHMAN,
132,THE ENGLISHMAN,"Born in the flesh, and bred in the bone,"
133,THE ENGLISHMAN,Some of us harbour still
134,THE ENGLISHMAN,A New World pride: and we flaunt or hide
135,THE ENGLISHMAN,The Spirit of Bunker Hill.
136,THE ENGLISHMAN,"We claim our place, as a separate race,"
137,THE ENGLISHMAN,Or a self-created clan;
138,THE ENGLISHMAN,"Till there comes a day when we like to say,"
139,THE ENGLISHMAN,‘We are kin of the Englishman.’
140,THE ENGLISHMAN,
141,THE ENGLISHMAN,"For under the front that seems so cold,"
142,THE ENGLISHMAN,"And the voice that is wont to storm,"
143,THE ENGLISHMAN,"We are certain to find, a big, broad mind"
144,THE ENGLISHMAN,And a heart that is soft and warm.
145,THE ENGLISHMAN,"And he carries his woes in a lordly way,"
146,THE ENGLISHMAN,As only the great souls can:
147,THE ENGLISHMAN,"And it makes us glad when in truth we say,"
148,THE ENGLISHMAN,We are kin of the Englishman.’
149,THE ENGLISHMAN,
150,THE ENGLISHMAN,"He slams his door in the face of the world,"
151,THE ENGLISHMAN,If he thinks the world too bold.
152,THE ENGLISHMAN,He will even curse; but he opens his purse
153,THE ENGLISHMAN,"To the poor, and the sick, and the old."
154,THE ENGLISHMAN,"He is slow in giving to woman the vote,"
155,THE ENGLISHMAN,And slow to put up her fan;
156,THE ENGLISHMAN,"But he gives her room in the hour of doom,"
157,THE ENGLISHMAN,And dies—like an Englishman.

191,CANADA,
192,CANADA,"_England_, _father and mother in one_,"

242,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,To offer England’s son.
243,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,The rising bell of Progress rings;

266,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,"This is a crucial hour, when Fate"
267,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,Tries Monarchs as by fire.
268,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,All rulers must be more than just—
269,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,Men starve on bread alone.
270,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,Old England’s sense of _right_ is great:
271,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,But now let her aspire
272,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,"To feel more love, and build thereof"
273,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,An everlasting Throne.
274,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,
275,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,"The dreaming East, awake at last,"
276,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,Is asking ‘when’ and ‘why’;
277,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,"Wait not too long nor answer wrong,"

287,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,Must conquer first its heart.
288,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,"Such might as Man has never known,"
289,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,"And power undreamed by kings,"
290,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,And boundless strength would come at length
291,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,To one who used that art.
292,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,
293,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,For now has dawned the People’s day:
294,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,A day of great unrest.
295,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,Nor king nor creed can still man’s need
296,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,Of time and space to grow.
297,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,"All lands must shape a wider way,"

311,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,"On this round globe, oh, when and where"
312,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,Were fitter time and scene
313,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,For Woman’s soul to reach its goal
314,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,Than _now_ in England’s realm.
315,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,Was not the crown its King will wear
316,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,Made glorious by its Queen?
317,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,And who steered straight its ship of State?

320,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,"Kings have been kings by accident,"
321,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,"By favour and by force,"

323,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,And Empires rich and broad
324,CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER,For England’s King to-day are blent

401,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,
402,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,They walked the valley of the dead;
403,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,Lit by a weird half light;
404,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,"No sound they made, no word they said;"
405,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,And they were pale with fright.
406,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,Then suddenly from unseen places came
407,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,"Loud laughter, that was like a whip of flame."
408,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,
409,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,"They looked, and saw, beyond, above,"

413,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,"And each one stood in anguish dumb and wild,"

415,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,

436,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,
437,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,Thus spake the spectral children; thus

446,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,Their path was lit with one wan ray
447,A BALLADE OF THE UNBORN DEAD,From ghostly children’s eyes;

1668,FORWARD,With onward pointing feet and searching eyes

1771,THE GOSSIPS,
1772,THE GOSSIPS,
1773,THE GOSSIPS,"A rose in my garden, the sweetest and fairest,"
1774,THE GOSSIPS,Was hanging her head through the long golden hours;
1775,THE GOSSIPS,"And early one morning I saw her tears falling,"
1776,THE GOSSIPS,And heard a low gossiping talk in the bowers.
1777,THE GOSSIPS,
1778,THE GOSSIPS,"The yellow Nasturtium, a spinster all faded,"
1779,THE GOSSIPS,Was telling a Lily what ailed the poor Rose:
1780,THE GOSSIPS,"‘That wild, roving Bee, who was hanging about her"
1781,THE GOSSIPS,"Has jilted her squarely, as every one knows."
1782,THE GOSSIPS,
1783,THE GOSSIPS,"‘I knew when he came, with his singing and sighing,"
1784,THE GOSSIPS,"His airs and his speeches, so fine and so sweet,"
1785,THE GOSSIPS,"Just how it would end; but no one would believe me,"
1786,THE GOSSIPS,For all were quite ready to fall at his feet.’
1787,THE GOSSIPS,
1788,THE GOSSIPS,"‘Indeed, you are wrong,’ said the Lilybelle proudly,"
1789,THE GOSSIPS,‘I cared nothing for him.  He called on me once
1790,THE GOSSIPS,"And would have come often, no doubt, if I’d asked him."
1791,THE GOSSIPS,"But though he was handsome, I thought him a dunce.’"
1792,THE GOSSIPS,
1793,THE GOSSIPS,"‘Now, now, that’s not true,’ cried the tall Oleander."
1794,THE GOSSIPS,‘He has travelled and seen every flower that grows;
1795,THE GOSSIPS,"And one who has supped in the garden of princes,"
1796,THE GOSSIPS,We all might have known would not wed with the Rose.’
1797,THE GOSSIPS,
1798,THE GOSSIPS,‘But wasn’t she proud when he showed her attention?
1799,THE GOSSIPS,"And she let him caress her,’ said sly Mignonette."
1800,THE GOSSIPS,‘And I used to see it and blush for her folly.
1801,THE GOSSIPS,The silly thing thinks he will come to her yet.’
1802,THE GOSSIPS,
1803,THE GOSSIPS,"‘I thought he was splendid,’ said pretty, pert Larkspur."
1804,THE GOSSIPS,"‘So dark and so grand, with that gay cloak of gold;"
1805,THE GOSSIPS,"But he tried once to kiss me, the impudent fellow,"
1806,THE GOSSIPS,And I got offended; I thought him too bold.’
1807,THE GOSSIPS,
1808,THE GOSSIPS,"‘Oh, fie!’ laughed the Almond.  ‘That does for a story."
1809,THE GOSSIPS,"Though I hang down my head, yet I see all that goes;"
1810,THE GOSSIPS,"And I saw you reach out, trying hard to detain him,"
1811,THE GOSSIPS,But he just tapped your cheek and flew by to the Rose.
1812,THE GOSSIPS,
1813,THE GOSSIPS,"‘He cared nothing for her, he only was flirting"
1814,THE GOSSIPS,"To while away time, as every one knew;"
1815,THE GOSSIPS,"So I turned a cold shoulder to all his advances,"
1816,THE GOSSIPS,Because I was certain his heart was untrue.’
1817,THE GOSSIPS,
1818,THE GOSSIPS,‘The Rose it served right for her folly in trusting
1819,THE GOSSIPS,"An oily-tongued stranger,’ quoth proud Columbine."
1820,THE GOSSIPS,"‘I knew what he was, and thought once I would warn her."
1821,THE GOSSIPS,"But, of course, the affair was no business of mine.’"
1822,THE GOSSIPS,
1823,THE GOSSIPS,"‘Oh, well,’ cried the Peony, shrugging her shoulders,"
1824,THE GOSSIPS,‘I saw all along that the Bee was a flirt;
1825,THE GOSSIPS,"But the Rose has been always so praised and so petted,"
1826,THE GOSSIPS,I thought a good lesson would do her no hurt.’
1827,THE GOSSIPS,
1828,THE GOSSIPS,Just then came a sound of a love-song sung sweetly;
1829,THE GOSSIPS,I saw my proud Rose lifting up her bowed head;
1830,THE GOSSIPS,"And the talk of the gossips was hushed in a moment,"
1831,THE GOSSIPS,And the whole garden listened to hear what was said.
1832,THE GOSSIPS,
1833,THE GOSSIPS,"And the dark, handsome Bee, with his cloak o’er his shoulder,"
1834,THE GOSSIPS,"Came swift through the sunlight and kissed the sad Rose,"
1835,THE GOSSIPS,"And whispered: ‘My darling, I’ve roved the world over,"
