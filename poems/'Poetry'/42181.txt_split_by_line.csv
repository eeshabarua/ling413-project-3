43,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
44,PREFACE.,
45,PREFACE.,
46,PREFACE.,"The writer of the following pages has been in the habit, for many years,"
47,PREFACE.,of amusing himself with the composition of Poetry. Often has he been
48,PREFACE.,"advised by his friends to publish; and at length, influenced by their"
49,PREFACE.,"persuasion, and feeling a sort of paternal fondness for the offspring of"
50,PREFACE.,"his own brain, he ventures to present this small volume to the notice of"
51,PREFACE.,the Public.
52,PREFACE.,
53,PREFACE.,"It contains Poems of many different kinds, composed, of course, in as"
54,PREFACE.,many varieties of style; and the author has exerted his best endeavours
55,PREFACE.,to render them worthy of approbation. The present times--he is well
56,PREFACE.,aware--are unfavourable for the publication of poetical works. The
57,PREFACE.,booksellers complain generally of the little demand for them.
58,PREFACE.,"Nevertheless, it is very improbable that Poetry,--if excellent, (as it"
59,PREFACE.,"ought to be to deserve the name,) should ever be totally neglected. The"
60,PREFACE.,seed of poetic taste is sown by the hand of Nature in the souls of all
61,PREFACE.,men; though in a small number only it is by culture brought to maturity.
62,PREFACE.,
63,PREFACE.,"The author has exalted ideas of Poetry, He deems it--decidedly--the"
64,PREFACE.,"first of the Fine Arts. It is the most intellectual,--the most"
65,PREFACE.,"comprehensive,--the most powerful,--the most delightful,--and,"
66,PREFACE.,"also,--hear it, Utilitarians!--the most useful. In remote antiquity, as"
67,PREFACE.,"is well known, it was chiefly instrumental in teaching and civilising"
68,PREFACE.,"the then-barbarous human race. To lure their wild minds into reflection,"
69,PREFACE.,"it invested truth and morality with the many-coloured garb of Fiction,"
70,PREFACE.,"and introduced them, through their delighted imagination, to their"
71,PREFACE.,"understanding and their heart; while, by the charm of harmonious"
72,PREFACE.,"numbers, it soothed their fierce and licentious passions into submission"
73,PREFACE.,to the laws of social life. It was believed to have something divine in
74,PREFACE.,"its nature, and was universally held in the highest veneration. From"
75,PREFACE.,"ancient times, even to this day, it has continued to be a favourite"
76,PREFACE.,study with many of the most illustrious characters.
77,PREFACE.,
78,PREFACE.,"Finally,--and let this be for ever remembered, as conferring on it the"
79,PREFACE.,highest honour! Poetry has been deemed worthy by the Sacred Writers to
80,PREFACE.,be made an instrument in the cause of Religion; and by its sublime
81,PREFACE.,"descriptions it has assisted human imagination in forming grand, and"
82,PREFACE.,awful conceptions of the Almighty Creator!
