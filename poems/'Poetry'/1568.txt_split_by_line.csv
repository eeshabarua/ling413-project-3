82,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"_My friend and publisher_, _Mr. Alfred Nutt_, _asks me to introduce this"
83,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"re-issue of old work in a new shape_.  _At his request_, _then_, _I have"
84,_ADVERTISEMENT_,to say that nearly all the numbers contained in the present volume are
85,_ADVERTISEMENT_,reprinted from_ ‘_A Book of Verses_’ (1888) _and_ ‘_London Voluntaries_’
86,_ADVERTISEMENT_,(1892–3).  _From the first of these I have removed some copies of verse
87,_ADVERTISEMENT_,which seemed to me scarce worth keeping_; _and I have recovered for it
88,_ADVERTISEMENT_,certain others from those publications which had made room for them_.  _I
89,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"have corrected where I could_, _added such dates as I might_, _and_, _by"
90,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"re-arrangement and revision_, _done my best to give my book_, _such as it"
91,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"is_, _its final form_.  _If any be displeased by the result_, _I can but"
92,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"submit that my verses are my own_, _and that this is how I would have"
93,_ADVERTISEMENT_,them read_.
94,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
95,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"_The work of revision has reminded me that_, _small as is this book of"
96,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"mine_, _it is all in the matter of verse that I have to show for the"
97,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"years between_ 1872 _and_ 1897.  _A principal reason is that_, _after"
98,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"spending the better part of my life in the pursuit of poetry_, _I found"
99,_ADVERTISEMENT_,myself_ (_about_ 1877) _so utterly unmarketable that I had to own myself
100,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"beaten in art_, _and to addict myself to journalism for the next ten"
101,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"years_.  _Came the production by my old friend_, _Mr. H. B. Donkin_, _in"
102,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"his little collection of_ ‘_Voluntaries_’ (1888), _compiled for that"
103,_ADVERTISEMENT_,East-End Hospital to which he has devoted so much time and energy and
104,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"skill_, _of those unrhyming rhythms in which I had tried to"
105,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"quintessentialize_, _as_ (_I believe_) _one scarce can do in rhyme_, _my"
106,_ADVERTISEMENT_,impressions of the Old Edinburgh Infirmary_.  _They had long __since been
107,_ADVERTISEMENT_,rejected by every editor of standing in London—I had well-nigh said in
108,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"the world_; _but as soon as Mr. Nutt had read them_, _he entreated me to"
109,_ADVERTISEMENT_,look for more_.  _I did as I was told_; _old dusty sheaves were dragged
110,_ADVERTISEMENT_,to light_; _the work of selection and correction was begun_; _I burned
111,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"much_; _I found that_, _after all_, _the lyrical instinct had slept—not"
112,_ADVERTISEMENT_,died_; _I ventured_ (_in brief_) ‘_A Book of Verses_.’  _It was received
113,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"with so much interest that I took heart once more_, _and wrote the"
114,_ADVERTISEMENT_,numbers presently reprinted from_ ‘_The National Observer_’ _in the
115,_ADVERTISEMENT_,collection first_ (1892) _called_ ‘_The Song of the Sword_’ _and
116,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"afterwards_ (1893), ‘_London voluntaries_.’  _If I have said nothing"
117,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"since_, _it is that I have nothing to say which is not_, _as yet_, _too"
118,_ADVERTISEMENT_,personal—too personal and too a afflicting—for utterance_.
119,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
120,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"_For the matter of my book_, _it is there to speak for itself_:—"

122,_ADVERTISEMENT_,‘_Here’s a sigh to those who love me_
123,_ADVERTISEMENT_,_And a smile to those who hate_.’

1456,ENTERTAINMENTS,"His wonderful game,"

1458,ENTERTAINMENTS,Refreshed from kegs not coopered in this our world.
1459,ENTERTAINMENTS,
1460,ENTERTAINMENTS,"But what were these so near,"
1461,ENTERTAINMENTS,So neighbourly fancies to the spell that brought
1462,ENTERTAINMENTS,The run of Ali Baba’s Cave
1463,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Just for the saying ‘Open Sesame,’"
1464,ENTERTAINMENTS,"With gold to measure, peck by peck,"
1465,ENTERTAINMENTS,"In round, brown wooden stoups"
1466,ENTERTAINMENTS,You borrowed at the chandler’s? . . . Or one time
1467,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Made you Aladdin’s friend at school,"
1468,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Free of his Garden of Jewels, Ring and Lamp"
1469,ENTERTAINMENTS,"In perfect trim? . . . Or Ladies, fair"
1470,ENTERTAINMENTS,For all the embrowning scars in their white breasts
1471,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Went labouring under some dread ordinance,"
1472,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Which made them whip, and bitterly cry the while,"
1473,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Strange Curs that cried as they,"
1474,ENTERTAINMENTS,Till there was never a Black Bitch of all
1475,ENTERTAINMENTS,Your consorting but might have gone
1476,ENTERTAINMENTS,Spell-driven miserably for crimes
1477,ENTERTAINMENTS,Done in the pride of womanhood and desire . . .
1478,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Or at the ghostliest altitudes of night,"
1479,ENTERTAINMENTS,"While you lay wondering and acold,"
1480,ENTERTAINMENTS,Your sense was fearfully purged; and soon
1481,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Queen Labé, abominable and dear,"
1482,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Rose from your side, opened the Box of Doom,"
1483,ENTERTAINMENTS,Scattered the yellow powder (which I saw
1484,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Like sulphur at the Docks in bulk),"
1485,ENTERTAINMENTS,And muttered certain words you could not hear;
1486,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And there! a living stream,"
1487,ENTERTAINMENTS,"The brook you bathed in, with its weeds and flags"
1488,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And cresses, glittered and sang"
1489,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Out of the hearthrug over the nakedness,"
1490,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Fair-scrubbed and decent, of your bedroom floor! . . ."
1491,ENTERTAINMENTS,
1492,ENTERTAINMENTS,I was—how many a time!—
1493,ENTERTAINMENTS,"That Second Calendar, Son of a King,"
1494,ENTERTAINMENTS,"On whom ’twas vehemently enjoined,"
1495,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Pausing at one mysterious door,"
1496,ENTERTAINMENTS,"To pry no closer, but content his soul"
1497,ENTERTAINMENTS,With his kind Forty.  Yet I could not rest
1498,ENTERTAINMENTS,For idleness and ungovernable Fate.
1499,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And the Black Horse, which fed on sesame"
1500,ENTERTAINMENTS,"(That wonder-working word!),"
1501,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Vouchsafed his back to me, and spread his vans,"
1502,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And soaring, soaring on"
1503,ENTERTAINMENTS,"From air to air, came charging to the ground"
1504,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Sheer, like a lark from the midsummer clouds,"
1505,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And, shaking me out of the saddle, where I sprawled"
1506,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Flicked at me with his tail,"
1507,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And left me blinded, miserable, distraught"
1508,ENTERTAINMENTS,"(Even as I was in deed,"
1509,ENTERTAINMENTS,"When doctors came, and odious things were done"
1510,ENTERTAINMENTS,On my poor tortured eyes
1511,ENTERTAINMENTS,With lancets; or some evil acid stung
1512,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And wrung them like hot sand,"
1513,ENTERTAINMENTS,And desperately from room to room
1514,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Fumble I must my dark, disconsolate way),"
1515,ENTERTAINMENTS,To get to Bagdad how I might.  But there
1516,ENTERTAINMENTS,I met with Merry Ladies.  O you three—
1517,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Safie, Amine, Zobëidé—when my heart"
1518,ENTERTAINMENTS,Forgets you all shall be forgot!
1519,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And so we supped, we and the rest,"
1520,ENTERTAINMENTS,"On wine and roasted lamb, rose-water, dates,"
1521,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Almonds, pistachios, citrons.  And Haroun"
1522,ENTERTAINMENTS,Laughed out of his lordly beard
1523,ENTERTAINMENTS,On Giaffar and Mesrour (_I_ knew the Three
1524,ENTERTAINMENTS,For all their Mossoul habits).  And outside
1525,ENTERTAINMENTS,"The Tigris, flowing swift"
1526,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Like Severn bend for bend, twinkled and gleamed"
1527,ENTERTAINMENTS,With broken and wavering shapes of stranger stars;
1528,ENTERTAINMENTS,"The vast, blue night"
1529,ENTERTAINMENTS,Was murmurous with peris’ plumes
1530,ENTERTAINMENTS,And the leathern wings of genies; words of power
1531,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Were whispering; and old fishermen,"
1532,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Casting their nets with prayer, might draw to shore"
1533,ENTERTAINMENTS,Dead loveliness: or a prodigy in scales
1534,ENTERTAINMENTS,Worth in the Caliph’s Kitchen pieces of gold:
1535,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Or copper vessels, stopped with lead,"
1536,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Wherein some Squire of Eblis watched and railed,"
1537,ENTERTAINMENTS,In durance under potent charactry
1538,ENTERTAINMENTS,Graven by the seal of Solomon the King . . .
1539,ENTERTAINMENTS,
1540,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Then, as the Book was glassed"
1541,ENTERTAINMENTS,"In Life as in some olden mirror’s quaint,"
1542,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Bewildering angles, so would Life"
1543,ENTERTAINMENTS,Flash light on light back on the Book; and both
1544,ENTERTAINMENTS,Were changed.  Once in a house decayed
1545,ENTERTAINMENTS,"From better days, harbouring an errant show"
1546,ENTERTAINMENTS,(For all its stories of dry-rot
1547,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Were filled with gruesome visitants in wax,"
1548,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Inhuman, hushed, ghastly with Painted Eyes),"
1549,ENTERTAINMENTS,I wandered; and no living soul
1550,ENTERTAINMENTS,Was nearer than the pay-box; and I stared
1551,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Upon them staring—staring.  Till at last,"
1552,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Three sets of rafters from the streets,"
1553,ENTERTAINMENTS,"I strayed upon a mildewed, rat-run room,"
1554,ENTERTAINMENTS,"With the two Dancers, horrible and obscene,"
1555,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Guarding the door: and there, in a bedroom-set,"
1556,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Behind a fence of faded crimson cords,"
1557,ENTERTAINMENTS,With an aspect of frills
1558,ENTERTAINMENTS,And dimities and dishonoured privacy
1559,ENTERTAINMENTS,"That made you hanker and hesitate to look,"
1560,ENTERTAINMENTS,"A Woman with her litter of Babes—all slain,"
1561,ENTERTAINMENTS,"All in their nightgowns, all with Painted Eyes"
1562,ENTERTAINMENTS,Staring—still staring; so that I turned and ran
1563,ENTERTAINMENTS,"As for my neck, but in the street"
1564,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Took breath.  The same, it seemed,"
1565,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And yet not all the same, I was to find,"
1566,ENTERTAINMENTS,"As I went up!  For afterwards,"
1567,ENTERTAINMENTS,Whenas I went my round alone—
1568,ENTERTAINMENTS,"All day alone—in long, stern, silent streets,"
1569,ENTERTAINMENTS,Where I might stretch my hand and take
1570,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Whatever I would: still there were Shapes of Stone,"
1571,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Motionless, lifelike, frightening—for the Wrath"
1572,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Had smitten them; but they watched,"
1573,ENTERTAINMENTS,"This by her melons and figs, that by his rings"
1574,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And chains and watches, with the hideous gaze,"
1575,ENTERTAINMENTS,"The Painted Eyes insufferable,"
1576,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Now, of those grisly images; and I"
1577,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Pursued my best-belovéd quest,"
1578,ENTERTAINMENTS,Thrilled with a novel and delicious fear.
1579,ENTERTAINMENTS,So the night fell—with never a lamplighter;
1580,ENTERTAINMENTS,And through the Palace of the King
1581,ENTERTAINMENTS,"I groped among the echoes, and I felt"
1582,ENTERTAINMENTS,"That they were there,"
1583,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Dreadfully there, the Painted staring Eyes,"
1584,ENTERTAINMENTS,Hall after hall . . . Till lo! from far
1585,ENTERTAINMENTS,A Voice!  And in a little while
1586,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Two tapers burning!  And the Voice,"
1587,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Heard in the wondrous Word of God, was—whose?"
1588,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Whose but Zobëidé’s,"
1589,ENTERTAINMENTS,"The lady of my heart, like me"
1590,ENTERTAINMENTS,"A True Believer, and like me"
1591,ENTERTAINMENTS,An outcast thousands of leagues beyond the pale! . . .
1592,ENTERTAINMENTS,
1593,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Or, sailing to the Isles"
1594,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Of Khaledan, I spied one evenfall"
1595,ENTERTAINMENTS,A black blotch in the sunset; and it grew
1596,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Swiftly . . . and grew.  Tearing their beards,"
1597,ENTERTAINMENTS,"The sailors wept and prayed; but the grave ship,"
1598,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Deep laden with spiceries and pearls, went mad,"
1599,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Wrenched the long tiller out of the steersman’s hand,"
1600,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And, turning broadside on,"
1601,ENTERTAINMENTS,"As the most iron would, was haled and sucked"
1602,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Nearer, and nearer yet;"
1603,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And, all awash, with horrible lurching leaps"
1604,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Rushed at that Portent, casting a shadow now"
1605,ENTERTAINMENTS,"That swallowed sea and sky; and then,"
1606,ENTERTAINMENTS,Anchors and nails and bolts
1607,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Flew screaming out of her, and with clang on clang,"
1608,ENTERTAINMENTS,"A noise of fifty stithies, caught at the sides"
1609,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Of the Magnetic Mountain; and she lay,"
1610,ENTERTAINMENTS,"A broken bundle of firewood, strown piecemeal"
1611,ENTERTAINMENTS,About the waters; and her crew
1612,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Passed shrieking, one by one; and I was left"
1613,ENTERTAINMENTS,To drown.  All the long night I swam;
1614,ENTERTAINMENTS,"But in the morning, O, the smiling coast"
1615,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Tufted with date-trees, meadowlike,"
1616,ENTERTAINMENTS,Skirted with shelving sands!  And a great wave
1617,ENTERTAINMENTS,Cast me ashore; and I was saved alive.
1618,ENTERTAINMENTS,"So, giving thanks to God, I dried my clothes,"
1619,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And, faring inland, in a desert place"
1620,ENTERTAINMENTS,I stumbled on an iron ring—
1621,ENTERTAINMENTS,The fellow of fifty built into the Quays:
1622,ENTERTAINMENTS,"When, scenting a trap-door,"
1623,ENTERTAINMENTS,"I dug, and dug; until my biggest blade"
1624,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Stuck into wood.  And then,"
1625,ENTERTAINMENTS,"The flight of smooth-hewn, easy-falling stairs,"
1626,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Sunk in the naked rock!  The cool, clean vault,"
1627,ENTERTAINMENTS,So neat with niche on niche it might have been
1628,ENTERTAINMENTS,Our beer-cellar but for the rows
1629,ENTERTAINMENTS,Of brazen urns (like monstrous chemist’s jars)
1630,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Full to the wide, squat throats"
1631,ENTERTAINMENTS,"With gold-dust, but a-top"
1632,ENTERTAINMENTS,A layer of pickled-walnut-looking things
1633,ENTERTAINMENTS,"I knew for olives!  And far, O, far away,"
1634,ENTERTAINMENTS,The Princess of China languished!  Far away
1635,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Was marriage, with a Vizier and a Chief"
1636,ENTERTAINMENTS,Of Eunuchs and the privilege
1637,ENTERTAINMENTS,Of going out at night
1638,ENTERTAINMENTS,"To play—unkenned, majestical, secure—"
1639,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Where the old, brown, friendly river shaped"
1640,ENTERTAINMENTS,Like Tigris shore for shore!  Haply a Ghoul
1641,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Sat in the churchyard under a frightened moon,"
1642,ENTERTAINMENTS,"A thighbone in his fist, and glared"
1643,ENTERTAINMENTS,At supper with a Lady: she who took
1644,ENTERTAINMENTS,Her rice with tweezers grain by grain.
1645,ENTERTAINMENTS,Or you might stumble—there by the iron gates
1646,ENTERTAINMENTS,Of the Pump Room—underneath the limes—
1647,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Upon Bedreddin in his shirt and drawers,"
1648,ENTERTAINMENTS,Just as the civil Genie laid him down.
1649,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Or those red-curtained panes,"
1650,ENTERTAINMENTS,Whence a tame cornet tenored it throatily
1651,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Of beer-pots and spittoons and new long pipes,"
1652,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Might turn a caravansery’s, wherein"
1653,ENTERTAINMENTS,"You found Noureddin Ali, loftily drunk,"
1654,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And that fair Persian, bathed in tears,"
1655,ENTERTAINMENTS,You’d not have given away
1656,ENTERTAINMENTS,For all the diamonds in the Vale Perilous
1657,ENTERTAINMENTS,You had that dark and disleaved afternoon
1658,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Escaped on a roc’s claw,"
1659,ENTERTAINMENTS,Disguised like Sindbad—but in Christmas beef!
1660,ENTERTAINMENTS,And all the blissful while
1661,ENTERTAINMENTS,The schoolboy satchel at your hip
1662,ENTERTAINMENTS,Was such a bulse of gems as should amaze
1663,ENTERTAINMENTS,Grey-whiskered chapmen drawn
1664,ENTERTAINMENTS,"From over Caspian: yea, the Chief Jewellers"
1665,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Of Tartary and the bazaars,"
1666,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Seething with traffic, of enormous Ind.—"
1667,ENTERTAINMENTS,
1668,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Thus cried, thus called aloud, to the child heart"
1669,ENTERTAINMENTS,The magian East: thus the child eyes
1670,ENTERTAINMENTS,Spelled out the wizard message by the light
1671,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Of the sober, workaday hours"
1672,ENTERTAINMENTS,"They saw, week in week out, pass, and still pass"
1673,ENTERTAINMENTS,"In the sleepy Minster City, folded kind"
1674,ENTERTAINMENTS,"In ancient Severn’s arm,"
1675,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Amongst her water-meadows and her docks,"
1676,ENTERTAINMENTS,Whose floating populace of ships—
1677,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Galliots and luggers, light-heeled brigantines,"
1678,ENTERTAINMENTS,Bluff barques and rake-hell fore-and-afters—brought
1679,ENTERTAINMENTS,To her very doorsteps and geraniums
1680,ENTERTAINMENTS,The scents of the World’s End; the calls
1681,ENTERTAINMENTS,That may not be gainsaid to rise and ride
1682,ENTERTAINMENTS,Like fire on some high errand of the race;
1683,ENTERTAINMENTS,The irresistible appeals
1684,ENTERTAINMENTS,For comradeship that sound
1685,ENTERTAINMENTS,Steadily from the irresistible sea.
1686,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Thus the East laughed and whispered, and the tale,"
1687,ENTERTAINMENTS,Telling itself anew
1688,ENTERTAINMENTS,"In terms of living, labouring life,"
1689,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Took on the colours, busked it in the wear"
1690,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Of life that lived and laboured; and Romance,"
1691,ENTERTAINMENTS,"The Angel-Playmate, raining down"
1692,ENTERTAINMENTS,His golden influences
1693,ENTERTAINMENTS,"On all I saw, and all I dreamed and did,"
1694,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Walked with me arm in arm,"
1695,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Or left me, as one bediademed with straws"
1696,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And bits of glass, to gladden at my heart"
1697,ENTERTAINMENTS,Who had the gift to seek and feel and find
1698,ENTERTAINMENTS,His fiery-hearted presence everywhere.
1699,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Even so dear Hesper, bringer of all good things,"
1700,ENTERTAINMENTS,Sends the same silver dews
1701,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Of happiness down her dim, delighted skies"
1702,ENTERTAINMENTS,On some poor collier-hamlet—(mound on mound
1703,ENTERTAINMENTS,Of sifted squalor; here a soot-throated stalk
1704,ENTERTAINMENTS,Sullenly smoking over a row
1705,ENTERTAINMENTS,Of flat-faced hovels; black in the gritty air
1706,ENTERTAINMENTS,A web of rails and wheels and beams; with strings
1707,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Of hurtling, tipping trams)—"
1708,ENTERTAINMENTS,As on the amorous nightingales
1709,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And roses of Shíraz, or the walls and towers"
1710,ENTERTAINMENTS,Of Samarcand—the Ineffable—whence you espy
1711,ENTERTAINMENTS,"The splendour of Ginnistan’s embattled spears,"
1712,ENTERTAINMENTS,Like listed lightnings.
1713,ENTERTAINMENTS,Samarcand!
1714,ENTERTAINMENTS,That name of names!  That star-vaned belvedere
1715,ENTERTAINMENTS,Builded against the Chambers of the South!
1716,ENTERTAINMENTS,That outpost on the Infinite!
1717,ENTERTAINMENTS,And behold!
1718,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Questing therefrom, you knew not what wild tide"
1719,ENTERTAINMENTS,"Might overtake you: for one fringe,"
1720,ENTERTAINMENTS,"One suburb, is stablished on firm earth; but one"
1721,ENTERTAINMENTS,Floats founded vague
1722,ENTERTAINMENTS,In lubberlands delectable—isles of palm
1723,ENTERTAINMENTS,"And lotus, fortunate mains, far-shimmering seas,"
1724,ENTERTAINMENTS,The promise of wistful hills—

2240,BACK-VIEW,"Flowed radiant round your peacock feather,"
2241,BACK-VIEW,And glistered from your jewelled hand.
2242,BACK-VIEW,"Your tawny hair, turned strand on strand"
2243,BACK-VIEW,"And bound with blue ribands together,"
2244,BACK-VIEW,"Streaked the rough tartan, green like heather,"
2245,BACK-VIEW,That round your lissome shoulder spanned.
2246,BACK-VIEW,Your grace was quick my sense to seize:
2247,BACK-VIEW,"The quaint looped hat, the twisted tresses,"
2248,BACK-VIEW,"The close-drawn scarf, and under these"

2262,CROLUIS,His worn face glaring on the thoughtless throng
2263,CROLUIS,The stony peevishness of sightless men.
2264,CROLUIS,"He seemed scarce older than his clothes.  Again,"
2265,CROLUIS,"Grotesquing thinly many an old sweet song,"
2266,CROLUIS,"So cracked his fiddle, his hand so frail and wrong,"

2269,CROLUIS,"And, grasping wearily his bread-winner,"
2270,CROLUIS,"Stared dim towards the blue immensity,"

4160,V,The wealth of her enchanted urn
4161,V,"Till, over-billowing all between"
4162,V,"Her cheerful margents, grey and living green,"

4185,V,"But all desirable and frankly fair,"
4186,V,"As each were keeping some most prosperous tryst,"
4187,V,And in the knowledge went imparadised!
4188,V,"For look! a magical influence everywhere,"
4189,V,Look how the liberal and transfiguring air
4190,V,"Washes this inn of memorable meetings,"
4191,V,"This centre of ravishments and gracious greetings,"
4192,V,"Till, through its jocund loveliness of length"

4205,V,Renewing his beneficent endeavour!—
4206,V,"Still reigns and triumphs, as he hath triumphed and reigned"
4207,V,Since in the dim blue dawn of time
4208,V,"The universal ebb-and-flow began,"
4209,V,"To sound his ancient music, and prevails,"
4210,V,"By the persuasion of his mighty rhyme,"
4211,V,Here in this radiant and immortal street
4212,V,Lavishly and omnipotently as ever
4213,V,"In the open hills, the undissembling dales,"
4214,V,The laughing-places of the juvenile earth.
4215,V,"For lo! the wills of man and woman meet,"
4216,V,"Meet and are moved, each unto each endeared,"
4217,V,"As once in Eden’s prodigal bowers befell,"
4218,V,"To share his shameless, elemental mirth"
4219,V,"In one great act of faith: while deep and strong,"

5073,XXIII,Cheek on cheek—and where were they?
5074,XXIII,
5075,XXIII,Dust on dust engendering dust
5076,XXIII,"In the leafage fresh and boon,"
5077,XXIII,Man and maid fulfil their trust—
5078,XXIII,Still the morn turns merry June.
5079,XXIII,"Mother Life, Father Death"
5080,XXIII,"(O, the blackbird in the may!),"
5081,XXIII,"Each the other’s breath for breath,"
5082,XXIII,Fleet the times of the world away.

5087,XXIV,_To_ A. C.
5088,XXIV,
5089,XXIV,
5090,XXIV,"NOT to the staring Day,"
5091,XXIV,For all the importunate questionings he pursues
5092,XXIV,"In his big, violent voice,"
5093,XXIV,"Shall those mild things of bulk and multitude,"
5094,XXIV,The Trees—God’s sentinels
5095,XXIV,"Over His gift of live, life-giving air,"
5096,XXIV,"Yield of their huge, unutterable selves."
5097,XXIV,"Midsummer-manifold, each one"
5098,XXIV,"Voluminous, a labyrinth of life,"
5099,XXIV,"They keep their greenest musings, and the dim dreams"
5100,XXIV,"That haunt their leafier privacies,"
5101,XXIV,"Dissembled, baffling the random gapeseed still"
5102,XXIV,"With blank full-faces, or the innocent guile"
5103,XXIV,"Of laughter flickering back from shine to shade,"
5104,XXIV,"And disappearances of homing birds,"
5105,XXIV,And frolicsome freaks
5106,XXIV,Of little boughs that frisk with little boughs.
5107,XXIV,
5108,XXIV,But at the word
5109,XXIV,"Of the ancient, sacerdotal Night,"
5110,XXIV,"Night of the many secrets, whose effect—"
5111,XXIV,"Transfiguring, hierophantic, dread—"
5112,XXIV,"Themselves alone may fully apprehend,"
5113,XXIV,They tremble and are changed.
5114,XXIV,"In each, the uncouth individual soul"
5115,XXIV,Looms forth and glooms
5116,XXIV,"Essential, and, their bodily presences"
5117,XXIV,"Touched with inordinate significance,"
5118,XXIV,Wearing the darkness like the livery
5119,XXIV,"Of some mysterious and tremendous guild,"
5120,XXIV,They brood—they menace—they appal;
5121,XXIV,"Or the anguish of prophecy tears them, and they wring"
5122,XXIV,Wild hands of warning in the face
5123,XXIV,Of some inevitable advance of the doom;
5124,XXIV,"Or, each to the other bending, beckoning, signing"
5125,XXIV,"As in some monstrous market-place,"
5126,XXIV,"They pass the news, these Gossips of the Prime,"
5127,XXIV,In that old speech their forefathers
5128,XXIV,"Learned on the lawns of Eden, ere they heard"
5129,XXIV,The troubled voice of Eve
5130,XXIV,Naming the wondering folk of Paradise.
5131,XXIV,
5132,XXIV,"Your sense is sealed, or you should hear them tell"
5133,XXIV,"The tale of their dim life, with all"
5134,XXIV,Its compost of experience: how the Sun
5135,XXIV,"Spreads them their daily feast,"
5136,XXIV,"Sumptuous, of light, firing them as with wine;"
5137,XXIV,Of the old Moon’s fitful solicitude
5138,XXIV,And those mild messages the Stars
5139,XXIV,Descend in silver silences and dews;
5140,XXIV,"Or what the sweet-breathing West,"
5141,XXIV,"Wanton with wading in the swirl of the wheat,"
5142,XXIV,"Said, and their leafage laughed;"
5143,XXIV,And how the wet-winged Angel of the Rain
5144,XXIV,Came whispering . . . whispering; and the gifts of the Year—
5145,XXIV,The sting of the stirring sap
5146,XXIV,"Under the wizardry of the young-eyed Spring,"
5147,XXIV,"Their summer amplitudes of pomp,"
5148,XXIV,"Their rich autumnal melancholy, and the shrill,"
5149,XXIV,Embittered housewifery
5150,XXIV,"Of the lean Winter: all such things,"
5151,XXIV,"And with them all the goodness of the Master,"
5152,XXIV,"Whose right hand blesses with increase and life,"
5153,XXIV,Whose left hand honours with decay and death.
5154,XXIV,
5155,XXIV,Thus under the constraint of Night
5156,XXIV,"These gross and simple creatures,"
5157,XXIV,"Each in his scores of rings, which rings are years,"
5158,XXIV,A servant of the Will!
5159,XXIV,"And God, the Craftsman, as He walks"
5160,XXIV,"The floor of His workshop, hearkens, full of cheer"
5161,XXIV,In thus accomplishing
5162,XXIV,The aims of His miraculous artistry.
