9,DRIFTING.,[Illustration: 0019] 
10,DRIFTING.,|MY soul to-day 
11,DRIFTING.,Is far away 
12,DRIFTING.,Sailing the Vesuvian Bay; 
13,DRIFTING.,"My wing√©d boat, "
14,DRIFTING.,"A bird afloat, "
15,DRIFTING.,Swims round the purple peaks remote:-- 
16,DRIFTING.,|ROUND purple peaks 
17,DRIFTING.,"It sails, and seeks "
18,DRIFTING.,"Blue inlets and their crystal creeks, "
19,DRIFTING.,"Where high rocks throw, "
20,DRIFTING.,"Through deeps below, "
21,DRIFTING.,A duplicated golden glow. 
22,DRIFTING.,[Illustration: 0023] 
23,DRIFTING.,[Illustration: 0025] 
24,DRIFTING.,"|FAR, vague, and dim, "
25,DRIFTING.,The mountains swim; 
26,DRIFTING.,"While on Vesuvius' misty brim, "
27,DRIFTING.,"With outstretched hands, "
28,DRIFTING.,The gray smoke stands 
29,DRIFTING.,O'erlooking the volcanic lands. 
30,DRIFTING.,"|IN lofty lines, "
31,DRIFTING.,"'Mid palms and pines, "
32,DRIFTING.,"And olives, aloes, elms, and vines, "
33,DRIFTING.,Sorrento swings 
34,DRIFTING.,"On sunset wings, "
35,DRIFTING.,Where Tasso's spirit soars and sings. 
36,DRIFTING.,[Illustration: 0029] 
37,DRIFTING.,[Illustration: 0031] 
38,DRIFTING.,"|I HEED not, if "
39,DRIFTING.,My rippling skiff 
40,DRIFTING.,Float swift or slow from cliff to 
41,DRIFTING.,cliff;-- 
42,DRIFTING.,With dreamful eyes 
43,DRIFTING.,My spirit lies 
44,DRIFTING.,Under the walls of Paradise. 
45,DRIFTING.,Under the walls 
46,DRIFTING.,Where swells and falls 
47,DRIFTING.,The Bay's deep breast at intervals. 
48,DRIFTING.,[Illustration: 0033] 
49,DRIFTING.,"At peace I lie, "
50,DRIFTING.,"Blown softly by, "
51,DRIFTING.,A cloud upon this liquid sky. 
52,DRIFTING.,"The day, so mild, "
53,DRIFTING.,"Is Heaven's own child, "
54,DRIFTING.,With Earth and Ocean reconciled;-- 
55,DRIFTING.,The airs I feel 
56,DRIFTING.,Around me steal 
57,DRIFTING.,Are murmuring to the murmuring keel. 
58,DRIFTING.,|OVER the rail 
59,DRIFTING.,My hand I trail 
60,DRIFTING.,"Within the shadow of the sail, "
61,DRIFTING.,"A joy intense, "
62,DRIFTING.,The cooling sense 
63,DRIFTING.,Glides down my drowsy indolence. 
64,DRIFTING.,[Illustration: 0037] 
65,DRIFTING.,[Illustration: 0039] 
66,DRIFTING.,[Illustration: 0041] 
67,DRIFTING.,"|THE fisher's child, "
68,DRIFTING.,"With tresses wild, "
69,DRIFTING.,"Unto the smooth, bright sand beguiled, "
70,DRIFTING.,With glowing lips 
71,DRIFTING.,"Sings as she skips, "
72,DRIFTING.,Or gazes at the far-off ships. 
73,DRIFTING.,[Illustration: 0045] 
74,DRIFTING.,[Illustration: 0047] 
75,DRIFTING.,[Illustration: 0049] 
76,DRIFTING.,[Illustration: 0051] 
77,DRIFTING.,"|HAPPY ship, "
78,DRIFTING.,"To rise and dip, "
79,DRIFTING.,With the blue crystal at your lip! 
80,DRIFTING.,"O happy crew, "
81,DRIFTING.,My heart with you 
82,DRIFTING.,anew! 
83,DRIFTING.,"|NO more, no more "
84,DRIFTING.,The worldly shore 
85,DRIFTING.,Upbraids me with its loud uproar 
86,DRIFTING.,With dreamful eyes 
87,DRIFTING.,My spirit lies 
88,DRIFTING.,Under the walls of Paradise! 
89,DRIFTING.,[Illustration: 0055]
