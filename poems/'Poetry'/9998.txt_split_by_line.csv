26,ADVERTISEMENT.,"Before this book was printed, I thoughtlessly concluded there must be a"
27,ADVERTISEMENT.,"preface; but, on consideration, see no particular purpose it would"
28,ADVERTISEMENT.,"answer, and gladly decline a task I should have undertaken with much"
29,ADVERTISEMENT.,"timidity and reluctance. All I feel necessary to premise, is, that the"
30,ADVERTISEMENT.,tale in the Old Shepherd's Recollections is founded on an event which
31,ADVERTISEMENT.,happened in Ireland; and that last spring I suppressed the song ending
32,ADVERTISEMENT.,"in page 65 [The Old Man's Farewell], some time after it had been in the"
33,ADVERTISEMENT.,"hands of the composer, from meeting accidentally with a quotation in a"
34,ADVERTISEMENT.,magazine that resembled it.

101,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
102,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Though the heavens might menace on high,"
103,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,I would still push my vessel from shore;
104,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"At my calling undauntedly ply,"
105,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,And sing as I handled the oar.
106,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
107,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'When fortune rewarded my toil,"

111,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
112,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Though the winds and the waves were perverse,"
113,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,I was sure to be welcom'd with glee;

116,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
117,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Whether weary, with toiling in vain,"
118,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"Or gay, from abundant success,"
119,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"I heard the same blessing again,--"
120,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,I met the same tender caress:
121,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
122,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'I fancied the perils repay'd,"
123,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,That could such affection ensure;
124,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"By fondness and gratitude sway'd,"
125,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,I was eager to dare and endure.
126,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
127,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'My cot did each comfort contain,"

146,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
147,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'And yet, when some seasons had roll'd,"
148,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,I seem'd to awaken anew;

151,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
152,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'My boy became hardy and bold,"
153,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,His spirit was buoyant and free;

156,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
157,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'But the girl, like a bird in the bower,"

163,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"The manner endearing and mild,"
164,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,Not dreaming those qualities rare
165,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,Were to murther the peace of my child:
166,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
167,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,'That grandeur would ever descend
168,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"To seek for so lowly a bride,"
169,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"Or his fair one, a lover pretend,"
170,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,From all she held dear to divide:
171,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
172,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'That beauty was priz'd like a gem,"
173,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"Expected to dazzle and shine,"

186,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
187,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'With thy husband, from this happy clime,"
188,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,I had seen thee for ever depart!
189,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,Still hoping affection and time
190,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,Might soften the pride of his heart:
191,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
192,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'That a moment perhaps would arise,"
193,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"When, fondling a child on the knee,"
194,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"He might read, in its innocent eyes"
195,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,A lesson of pity for me.
196,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
197,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'But lips, which till then never said"
198,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"A word to cause any one pain,"
199,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"Inform'd me, when reason had fled,"
200,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,Of a conflict it could not sustain.
201,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
202,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'And he, who had wish'd to conceal"
203,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"That the woman he lov'd had been poor,"
204,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"Began all his folly to feel,"
205,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,When the victim could hearken no more.
206,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
207,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Yet still for himself did he mourn,"
208,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"And, indignant, I fled from the view:"

211,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
212,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'One prop, one sole comfort, remain'd,"
213,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"Who saw me o'erladen with grief,"

215,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,My heart was too sick for relief.
216,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
217,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'One, who always attentive and dear,"
218,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"Every effort exerted to please,"

220,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,To study my health and my ease.
221,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
222,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'For his was each toil and each care,"
223,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,The due observations to keep;
224,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"To sit watching amid the night air,"
225,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,And fancy his father asleep.
226,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
227,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Yet, dejected, and sadly forlorn,"
228,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"I dar'd in my heart to repine,--"
229,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"To lament that I ever was born,"
230,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,Though such worth and affection were mine.
231,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
232,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Alas! I was destin'd to know,"
233,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"However intense my despair,"
234,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"I still was reserv'd for a blow,"
235,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,More painful and cruel to bear.
236,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
237,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,'Yes! this only one fell in the main!
238,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,--I eagerly struggled to save;
239,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"But I strove with the current in vain,"
240,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,And saw him sink under the wave!
241,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
242,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'My head was astounded and wild,--"
243,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"Incessant I roam'd on the shore,"
244,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"To seek the dead corse of my child,"
245,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,And to weep on his bosom once more.
246,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,
247,THE OLD FISHERMAN.,"'Seven days undisturb'd was the sky,"
