50,PREFACE.,The arrogance of attempting a parody on the most ancient and sublime
51,PREFACE.,"poem in the Inspired Volume, is not mine. The great pleasure enjoyed in"
52,PREFACE.,"its perusal from early years, had occasionally prompted metrical"
53,PREFACE.,"imitations of isolated passages. These fragmentary effusions, recently"
54,PREFACE.,"woven together, are here presented, with the hope that as wandering"
55,PREFACE.,"streams are traced to their original fountain, some heart may thus be"
56,PREFACE.,"led to the history of the stricken and sustained Patriarch, with more"
57,PREFACE.,"studious research, purer delight, or a deeper spirit of devotion."

167,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--
168,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,The gathering back
169,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Of scattered flowrets to the household wreath.
170,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Brothers and sisters from their sever'd homes
171,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Meeting with ardent smile, to renovate"
172,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,The love that sprang from cradle memories
173,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"And childhood's sports, and whose perennial stream"
174,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Still threw fresh crystals o'er the sands of life.
175,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"--Each bore some treasured picture of the past,"
176,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Some graphic incident, by mellowing time"
177,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Made beautiful, while ever and anon,"
178,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Timbrel and harp broke forth, each pause between."
179,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Banquet and wine-cup, and the dance, gave speed"
180,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"To youthful spirits, and prolong'd the joy."

184,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The patriarch father, with a chasten'd heart"
185,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Partook his children's mirth, having God's fear"
186,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Ever before him. Earnestly he brought
187,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,His offerings and his prayers for every one
188,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Of that beloved group, lest in the swell"
189,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And surging superflux of happiness
190,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"They might forget the Hand from whence it came,"
191,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Perchance, displease the Almighty."
192,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Many a care
193,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Had he that wealth creates. Not such as lurks
194,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"In heaps metallic, which the rust corrodes,"
195,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,But wealth that fructifies within the earth
196,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Whence cometh bread, or o'er its surface roves"
197,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,In peaceful forms of quadrupedal life
198,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,That thronging round the world's first father came
199,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"To take their names, 'mid Eden's tranquil shades,"
200,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Ere sin was born.
201,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Obedient to the yoke,"
202,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Five hundred oxen turn'd the furrow'd glebe
203,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Where agriculture hides his buried seed
204,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Waiting the harvest hope, while patient wrought"
205,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,An equal number of that race who share
206,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The labor of the steed, without his praise."
207,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"--Three thousand camels, with their arching necks,"
208,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Ships of the desert, knelt to do his will,"
209,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"And bear his surplus wealth to distant climes,"
210,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,While more than twice three thousand snowy sheep
211,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Whitened the hills. Troops of retainers fed
212,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"These flocks and herds, and their subsistence drew"
213,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"From the same lord,--so that this man of Uz"
214,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Greater than all the magnates of the east,"
215,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Dwelt in old time before us.
216,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"True he gave,"
217,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"And faithfully, the hireling his reward,"
218,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Counting such justice 'mid the happier forms
219,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Of Charity, which with a liberal hand"
220,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,He to the sad and suffering poor dispensed.
221,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Eyes was he to the blind, and to the lame"
222,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Feet, while the stranger and the traveller found"
223,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Beneath, the welcome shelter of his roof"
224,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,The blessed boon of hospitality.
225,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,
226,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,To him the fatherless and widow sought
227,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,For aid and counsel. Fearlessly he rose
228,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,For those who had no helper. His just mind
229,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Brought stifled truth to light, disarm'd the wiles"
230,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Of power, and gave deliverance to the weak."
231,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"He pluck'd the victim from the oppressor's grasp,"
232,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And made the tyrant tremble.
233,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,To his words
234,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Men listened, as to lore oracular,"
235,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And when beside the gate he took his seat
236,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The young kept silence, and the old rose up"
237,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,To do him honor. After his decree
238,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"None spake again, for as a prince he dwelt"
239,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Wearing the diadem of righteousness,"
240,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And robed in that respect which greatness wins
241,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"When leagued with goodness, and by wisdom crown'd."
242,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,The grateful prayers and blessings of the souls
243,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Ready to perish, silently distill'd"
244,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Upon him, as he slept."
245,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,So as a tree
246,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Whose root is by the river's brink, he grew"
247,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"And flourish'd, while the dews like balm-drops hung"
248,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,All night upon his branches.
249,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Yet let none
250,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Of woman born, presume to build his hopes"
251,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"On the worn cliff of brief prosperity,"
252,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Or from the present promise, predicate"
253,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,The future joy. The exulting bird that sings
254,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Mid the green curtains of its leafy nest
255,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"His tuneful trust untroubled there to live,"
256,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"And there to die, may meet the archer's shaft"
257,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,When next it spreads the wing.
258,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,The tempest folds
259,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,O'er the smooth forehead of the summer noon
260,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Its undiscover'd purpose, to emerge"
261,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Resistless from its armory, and whelm"
262,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"In floods of ruin, ere the day decline."

265,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,
266,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Lightning and sword!
267,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Swift messengers, and sharp,"
268,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Reapers that leave no gleanings. In their path
269,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Silence and desolation fiercely stalk.
270,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"--O'er trampled hills, and on the blood-stain'd plains"
271,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"There is no low of kine, or bleat of flocks,"
272,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The fields are rifled, and the shepherds slain."
273,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,
274,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The Man of Uz, who stood but yestermorn"
275,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Above all compeers,--clothed with wealth and power,"
276,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,To day is poorer than his humblest hind.
277,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,A whirlwind from the desert!
278,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,All unwarn'd
279,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Its fury came. Earth like a vassal shook.
280,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Majestic trees flew hurtling through the air
281,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Like rootless reeds.
282,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,There was no time for flight.
283,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Buried in household wrecks, all helpless lay"
284,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Masses of quivering life.
285,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Job's eldest son
286,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,That day held banquet for their numerous line
287,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"At his own house. With revelry and song,"
288,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,One moment in the glow of kindred hearts
289,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The lordly mansion rang, the next they lay"
290,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Crush'd neath its ruins.
291,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"_He_,--the childless sire,"
292,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Last of his race, and lonely as the pine"
293,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,That crisps and blackens 'neath the lightning shaft
294,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Upon the cliff, with such a rushing tide"
295,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The mountain billows of his misery came,"
296,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Drove they not Reason from her beacon-hold?
297,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Swept they not his strong trust in Heaven away?
298,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,
299,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"List,--list,--the sufferer speaks."
300,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"""The Lord who gave"
301,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Hath taken away,--and blessed be His name."""
302,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,
303,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Oh Patriarch!--teach us, mid this changeful life"

354,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Alone he stole, and sadly took his seat"
355,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,In dust and ashes.
356,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"She, his bosom friend"
357,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The sharer of his lot for many years,"
358,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Sought out his dark retreat. Shuddering she saw
359,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"His kingly form like living sepulchre,"

373,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Her woman's strength gave way, and impious words"
374,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,In her despair she uttered.
375,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,But her lord
376,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,To deeper anguish stung by her defect
377,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"And rash advice, reprovingly replied"
378,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Pointing to Him who meeteth out below

422,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,When God's strong discipline doth try the soul;
423,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And that deep silence was more eloquent

1020,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Disdaineth not to fashion and sustain
1021,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,The crooked serpent. But how small a part
1022,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Of all its works are understood by us
1023,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Dim dwellers in this lowly vestibule,"
1024,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And by the thunders of mysterious power
1025,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Still held in awe.
1026,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,As the Eternal lives
1027,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Who hath bow'd down my soul, as long as breath"
1028,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Inspires this mortal frame, these lips shall ne'er"
1029,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Utter deceit, nor cast away the wealth"
1030,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Of a good conscience. While I live I'll hold
1031,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Fast mine integrity,--nor justify"
1032,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,The slanderous charges of a secret guilt
1033,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Ye bring against me.
1034,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,For what is the gain
1035,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Of the base hypocrite when God shall take
1036,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Away his perjured soul? Yourselves have seen
1037,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,How often in this life the wicked taste
1038,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Of retribution. The oppressor bears
1039,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Sway for a while,--but look!--the downfall comes."
1040,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"His offspring shall not flourish, nor his grave"
1041,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Be wet with widow's tears.
1042,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,The unjust rich man
1043,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Heapeth up silver for a stranger's hand,"
1044,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,He hoardeth raiment with a miser's greed
1045,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"To robe he knows not who, though he himself"
1046,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Had grudg'd to wear it. Boastfully he builds
1047,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,A costly mansion to preserve his name
1048,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Among the people. But like the slight booth,"
1049,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Brief lodge of summer, shall it pass away."
1050,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Terrors without a cause, disable him"
1051,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And drown his courage. Like a driven leaf
1052,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Before the whirlwind, shall he hasten down"
1053,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"To a dishonor'd tomb. Men shall rejoice,"
1054,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"And clap their hands, and hiss him from his place"
1055,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,When he departs.
1056,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Surely, there is a vein"
1057,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"For silver, and a secret bed for gold"
1058,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Which man discovers. Where the iron sleeps
1059,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"In darkest chambers of the mine he knows,"
1060,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And how the brass is molten. But a Mind
1061,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Deeper than his, close-hidden things explores,"
1062,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Searching out all perfection.
1063,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Earth unveils
1064,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The mystic treasures of her matron breast,"
1065,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Bread for her children, gems like living flame,"
1066,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Sapphires, whose azure emulates the skies,"
1067,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And dust of gold. Yet there's a curtain'd path
1068,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Which the unfettered denizens of air
1069,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Have not descried, nor even the piercing eye"
1070,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Of the black vulture seen. The lion's whelps
1071,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"In their wide roaming, nor their fiercer sire"
1072,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Have never trod it.
1073,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,There's a Hand that bares
1074,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The roots of mountains at its will, and cuts"
1075,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Through rifted rocks a channel, where the streams"
1076,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And rivers freely flow--an Eye that scans
1077,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Each precious thing.
1078,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,But where doth Wisdom dwell?
1079,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And in what curtain'd chamber was the birth
1080,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Of Understanding?
1081,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,The great Sea uplifts
1082,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Its hand in adjuration, and declares"
1083,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"""_'Tis not with me,_"" and its unfathom'd deep"
1084,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"In subterranean thunders, echoing cry"
1085,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"""_No, not with me._"""
1086,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Offer ye not for them
1087,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Silver, or Ophir's gold, nor think to exchange"
1088,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Onyx, or sapphire, or the coral branch"
1089,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Or crystal gem where hides imprison'd light,"
1090,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Nor make ye mention of the precious pearl
1091,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Or Ethiopian topaz, for their price"
1092,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Transcendeth rubies, or the dazzling ray"
1093,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Of concentrated jewels.
1094,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,In what place
1095,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Are found these wondrous treasures? Who will show
1096,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Their habitation? which alike defies
1097,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The ken of those who soar, or those who delve"
1098,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,In cells profound.
1099,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Death and destruction say,"
1100,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"From their hoarse caverns, ""We have heard their fame"
1101,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"But know them not."""
1102,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Lo! He who weighs the winds
1103,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Measures the floods, controls the surging sea"
1104,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"And points the forked lightnings where to play,"
1105,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"He, unto whom all mysteries are plain"
1106,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"All secrets open, all disguises clear,"
1107,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Saith unto man the questioner,--"
1108,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"""Behold"
1109,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The fear of God is wisdom, and to break"
1110,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,The sway of evil and depart from sin
1111,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Is understanding."""
1112,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Anguish wrings my soul
1113,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,As in my hours of musing I restore
1114,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The picture of my lost prosperity,"
1115,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,When round my side my loving children drew
1116,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And from my happy home my steps were hail'd
1117,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Where'er I went. The fatherless and poor,"
1118,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"And he who had no helper, welcomed me"
1119,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"As one to right their wrongs, and pluck the spoil"
1120,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,From the oppressor's teeth. Pale widows raised
1121,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The glistening eye of gratitude, and they"
1122,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Whose sight was quench'd, at my remembered tones"
1123,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Pour'd blessings on me. Overflowing wealth
1124,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Brought me no titles that I held so dear
1125,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"As father of the poor, and comforter"
1126,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Of all who mourn.
1127,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,When in the gate I sate
1128,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The nobles did me honor, and the wise"
1129,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Sought counsel of me. To my words the young
1130,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Gave earnest heed, the white-hair'd men stood up,"
1131,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"And princes waited for my speech, as wait"
1132,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,The fields in summer for the latter rain.
1133,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"But now, the children of base men spring up"
1134,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"And push away my feet, and make my name"
1135,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"A bye-word and a mockery, which was erst"
1136,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Set to the harp in song.
1137,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Because my wealth
1138,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"God hath resumed, they who ne'er dared to claim"
1139,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Equality with even the lowest ones
1140,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Who watch'd my flock, they whom my menials scorned,"
1141,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Dwellers in hovels, feeding like the brutes"
1142,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"On roots and bushes of the wilderness,"
1143,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Despise me, and in mean derision cast"
1144,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Marks of abhorrence at the fallen chief
1145,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Whom erst they fear'd.
1146,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Unpitied I endure
1147,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Sickness and pain that ope the narrow house
1148,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Where all the living go. My soul dissolves
1149,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And flows away as water--like the owl
1150,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"In lone, forgotten cavern I complain,"
1151,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,For all my instruments of music yield
1152,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"But mournful sounds, and from my organ comes"
1153,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,A sob of weeping.
1154,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,I appeal to Him
1155,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Who sees my ways, and all my steps doth count,"
1156,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,If I have walk'd with vanity or worn
1157,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"The veil of falsehood, or despised to obey"
1158,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,The law of duty; if I basely prowl'd
1159,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"With evil purpose round my neighbor's door,"
1160,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Or scorn'd my humblest menial's cause to right
1161,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"When he contended with me, and complain'd,"
1162,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Framed as he was of the same clay with me
1163,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,By the same Hand Divine; or shunn'd to share
1164,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Even my last morsel with the hungry poor,"
1165,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Or shield the uncovered suppliant with the fleece
1166,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Of my own cherish'd flock.
1167,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,If ere I made
1168,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Fine gold my confidence, or lifted up"
1169,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"My heart in pride, because my wealth was great,"
1170,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Or when I saw the glorious King of Day
1171,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Gladdening all nations, and the queenly Moon"
1172,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Walking in brightness, was enticed to pay"
1173,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"A secret homage,--'twere idolatry"
1174,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Unpardonably great.
1175,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,If I rejoiced
1176,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,In the affliction of mine enemy
1177,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Or for his hatred breathed a vengeful vow
1178,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"When trouble came upon him,--if I closed"
1179,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,The inhospitable door against the foot
1180,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Of stranger, or of traveller,--or withheld"
1181,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Full nutriment from any who abode
1182,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Within my tabernacle,--or refused"
1183,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Due justice even to my own furrow'd field,"
1184,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Then let my harvest unto thistles turn,"

1189,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Then ceased the Man of Uz, like one o'erspent,"
1190,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Feeling the fallacy of argument
1191,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"With auditors like these, his thoughts withdrew"
1192,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Into the shroud of silence, and he spake"
1193,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"No more unto them, standing fix'd and mute,"
1194,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Like statued marble.
1195,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Then, as none replied,"
1196,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"A youthful stranger rose, and while he stretch'd"
1197,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"His hand in act to speak, and heavenward raised"
1198,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"His clear, unshrinking brow, he worthy seem'd"
1199,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,To hold the balance of that high debate.
1200,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Still, an indignant warmth, with energy"

1207,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Or proved your theory that woes like his
1208,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Denote a secret guilt.
1209,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,I listened still
1210,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"With that respect which youth doth owe to age,"
1211,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"And till ye ceased to speak, refrain'd to show"
1212,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Mine own opinion. But there is a breath
1213,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"From the Almighty, that gives life to thought,"
1214,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And in my soul imprison'd utterance burns
1215,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Like torturing flame. So, will I give it vent"
1216,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Though I am young in years, and ye are old,"
1217,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,And should be wise. I will not shun to uphold

1219,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"With flattering titles, lest the kindling wrath"
1220,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Of an offended Maker, sweep me hence."
1221,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,
1222,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Hearken, O Job, I pray thee, to my words"

1225,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,More perfect innocence than appertains
1226,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"To erring man, and eager to refute"
1227,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,False accusation hast contemn'd the course
1228,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Of the All-Merciful.
1229,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Why shouldst thou strive
1230,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,With Him whose might of wisdom ne'er unveils
1231,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Its mysteries to man? Yet doth He deign
1232,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Such hints and precepts as the docile heart
1233,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"May comprehend. Sometimes in vision'd sleep,"
1234,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,His Spirit hovereth o'er the plastic mind
1235,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Sealing instruction. Or a different voice
1236,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Its sterner teaching tries. His vigor droops,"
1237,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,Strong pain amid the multitude of bones
1238,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"Doth revel, till his soul abhorreth meat."
1239,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,"His fair flesh wastes, and downward to the pit"
1240,A JOYOUS FESTIVAL.--,He hourly hastens. Holy Sympathy

2871,CANTO THIRD.,"To evil tempers, and a fierce disdain."
2872,CANTO THIRD.,"Methought, our Mother-Land, in this respect"
2873,CANTO THIRD.,Had wiser usages. Her little ones
2874,CANTO THIRD.,"At their own regular, plain table learn'd"
2875,CANTO THIRD.,"No culinary criticism, nor claim'd"
2876,CANTO THIRD.,Admission to the richly furnish'd board
2877,CANTO THIRD.,Nor deem'd the viands of their older friends
2878,CANTO THIRD.,Pertain'd to them.
2879,CANTO THIRD.,A pleasant sight it was
2880,CANTO THIRD.,"At close of day, their simple supper o'er,"
2881,CANTO THIRD.,"To find them in the quiet nursery laid,"
2882,CANTO THIRD.,Like rose-buds folded in a fragrant sheath
2883,CANTO THIRD.,To peaceful slumber. Hence their nerves attain'd
2884,CANTO THIRD.,"Firm texture, and the key-stone of the frame,"
2885,CANTO THIRD.,"This wondrous frame, so often sinn'd against,--"
2886,CANTO THIRD.,"Unwarp'd and undispeptic, gave to life"
2887,CANTO THIRD.,A higher zest.
2888,CANTO THIRD.,"Year after year swept by,"
2889,CANTO THIRD.,And Conrad's symmetry of form and face
2890,CANTO THIRD.,Grew more conspicuous. Yet he fail'd to win
2891,CANTO THIRD.,"Approval from the pious, or desire"
2892,CANTO THIRD.,To seek him as companion for their sons.
2893,CANTO THIRD.,
2894,CANTO THIRD.,"--At school and college he defied restraint,"
2895,CANTO THIRD.,And round the associates of his idle hours
2896,CANTO THIRD.,Threw a mysterious veil. But rumor spake
2897,CANTO THIRD.,"Of them, as those who would be sure to bring"
2898,CANTO THIRD.,Disgrace and infamy.
2899,CANTO THIRD.,Strong thirst for gold
2900,CANTO THIRD.,Sprang with the weeds of vice. His mother's purse
2901,CANTO THIRD.,"Was drain'd for him, and when at length she spake"
2902,CANTO THIRD.,"In warm remonstrance, he with rudeness rush'd"
2903,CANTO THIRD.,"Out of her presence, or withdrew himself"
2904,CANTO THIRD.,All night from her abode. Then she was fain
2905,CANTO THIRD.,To appease his anger by some lavish gift
2906,CANTO THIRD.,"From scant resources, which she ill could spare,"
2907,CANTO THIRD.,Making the evil worse.
2908,CANTO THIRD.,The growth of sin
2909,CANTO THIRD.,Is rank and rapid when the youthful heart
2910,CANTO THIRD.,Abjures the sway of duty. Weaving oft
2911,CANTO THIRD.,"The mesh of falsehood, may it not forget"
2912,CANTO THIRD.,"What the truth is? The wavering, moral sense"
2913,CANTO THIRD.,"Depraved and weaken'd, fails to grasp the clue"
2914,CANTO THIRD.,"Of certainty, nor scruples to deny"
2915,CANTO THIRD.,"Words utter'd, and deeds done, for conscience sleeps"
2916,CANTO THIRD.,"Stifled, and callous. Fearful must it be,"
2917,CANTO THIRD.,"When Truth offended and austere, confronts"
2918,CANTO THIRD.,The false soul at Heaven's bar.
2919,CANTO THIRD.,
2920,CANTO THIRD.,*   *   *   *   *
2921,CANTO THIRD.,
2922,CANTO THIRD.,An aged man
2923,CANTO THIRD.,"Dwelt by himself upon a dreary moor,"
2924,CANTO THIRD.,And it was whisper'd that a miser's hoard
2925,CANTO THIRD.,Absorb'd his thoughts.
2926,CANTO THIRD.,"There, at the midnight hour"
2927,CANTO THIRD.,The unwonted flash of lights was seen by those
2928,CANTO THIRD.,"Who chanced to pass, and entering in, they found"
2929,CANTO THIRD.,"The helpless inmate murder'd in his bed,"
2930,CANTO THIRD.,And the house rifled.
2931,CANTO THIRD.,Differing tracks they mark'd
2932,CANTO THIRD.,"Of flying footsteps in the moisten'd soil,"
2933,CANTO THIRD.,And eager search ensued.
2934,CANTO THIRD.,"At length, close hid"
2935,CANTO THIRD.,"In a dense thicket, Conrad they espied,"
2936,CANTO THIRD.,His shoes besmear'd with blood. Question'd of those
2937,CANTO THIRD.,"Who with him in this work of horror join'd,"
2938,CANTO THIRD.,He answered nothing.
2939,CANTO THIRD.,All unmov'd he stood
2940,CANTO THIRD.,"Upon his trial, the nefarious deed"
2941,CANTO THIRD.,"Denying, and of his accomplices"
2942,CANTO THIRD.,Disclosing nought. But still there seem'd a chain
2943,CANTO THIRD.,"Of evidence to bind him in its coil,"
2944,CANTO THIRD.,And Justice had her course. The prison bolts
2945,CANTO THIRD.,"Closed heavily behind him, and his doom"
2946,CANTO THIRD.,"For years, with felons was incorporate."
2947,CANTO THIRD.,
2948,CANTO THIRD.,*   *   *   *   *
2949,CANTO THIRD.,
2950,CANTO THIRD.,Of the wild anguish and despair that reign'd
2951,CANTO THIRD.,"In his ancestral home, no words can give"
2952,CANTO THIRD.,Description meet.
2953,CANTO THIRD.,In the poor mother's mind
2954,CANTO THIRD.,"Reason forsook its throne. Her last hope gone,"
2955,CANTO THIRD.,"Torn by a torrent from her death-like grasp,"
2956,CANTO THIRD.,"Having no anchor on the eternal Rock,"
2957,CANTO THIRD.,"She plunged beside it, into gulphs profound."
2958,CANTO THIRD.,"--She slept not, ate not, heeded no kind word,"
2959,CANTO THIRD.,"Caress of fondness, or benignant prayer:"
2960,CANTO THIRD.,"She only shriek'd,"
2961,CANTO THIRD.,"""My boy! my beautiful!"
2962,CANTO THIRD.,"They bind his hands!"""
2963,CANTO THIRD.,And then with frantic cries
2964,CANTO THIRD.,"She struggled 'gainst imaginary foes,"
2965,CANTO THIRD.,Till strength was gone.
2966,CANTO THIRD.,Through the long syncope
2967,CANTO THIRD.,Her never-resting lips essay'd to form
2968,CANTO THIRD.,"The gasping sounds,"
2969,CANTO THIRD.,"""My boy! my beautiful!"
2970,CANTO THIRD.,"Hence! Caitiffs! hence! my boy! my beautiful!"""
2971,CANTO THIRD.,"And in that unquell'd madness life went out,"
2972,CANTO THIRD.,Like lamp before the blast.
2973,CANTO THIRD.,
2974,CANTO THIRD.,*   *   *   *   *
2975,CANTO THIRD.,
2976,CANTO THIRD.,With sullen port
2977,CANTO THIRD.,Of bravery as one who scorns defeat
2978,CANTO THIRD.,"Though it hath come upon him, Conrad met"
2979,CANTO THIRD.,The sentence of the law. But its full force
2980,CANTO THIRD.,He fail'd to estimate; the stern restraint
2981,CANTO THIRD.,"On liberty of movement, coarsest fare,"
2982,CANTO THIRD.,"Stripes for the contumacious, and for all"
2983,CANTO THIRD.,"Labor, and silence."
2984,CANTO THIRD.,The inquiring glance
2985,CANTO THIRD.,"On the new-comer bent, from stolid eyes"
2986,CANTO THIRD.,"Of malefactors, harden'd to their lot,"
2987,CANTO THIRD.,"And hating all mankind, he coldly shunn'd"
2988,CANTO THIRD.,Or haughtily return'd. Yet there were lights
2989,CANTO THIRD.,"Even in this dark abode, not often found"
2990,CANTO THIRD.,"In penal regions, where the wrath of man"
2991,CANTO THIRD.,"Is prompt to punish, and remembereth not"
2992,CANTO THIRD.,The mercy that himself doth ask of God.
2993,CANTO THIRD.,
2994,CANTO THIRD.,"--A just man was the warden and humane,"
2995,CANTO THIRD.,"Not credulous, or easily deceiv'd,"
2996,CANTO THIRD.,"But hopeful of our nature, though deprav'd,"
2997,CANTO THIRD.,"And for the incarcerate, careful to restrain"
2998,CANTO THIRD.,All petty tyranny.
2999,CANTO THIRD.,Courteous was he
3000,CANTO THIRD.,"To visitants, for many such there were."
3001,CANTO THIRD.,"Philanthropists, whose happy faith believ'd"
3002,CANTO THIRD.,"Prisons reforming schools, came here to scan"
3003,CANTO THIRD.,Arrangements and appliances as guides
3004,CANTO THIRD.,"To other institutions: strangers too,"
3005,CANTO THIRD.,"Who 'mid their explorations of the State,"
3006,CANTO THIRD.,"Scenery and structures, would not overlook"
3007,CANTO THIRD.,Its model-prison.
3008,CANTO THIRD.,"Now and then, was seen"
3009,CANTO THIRD.,"Some care-worn mother, leading by the hand"
3010,CANTO THIRD.,"Her froward boy, with hope that he might learn"
3011,CANTO THIRD.,A lesson from the punishment he saw.
3012,CANTO THIRD.,
3013,CANTO THIRD.,--When day was closed and to his narrow cell
3014,CANTO THIRD.,"Bearing his supper, every prisoner went,"
3015,CANTO THIRD.,"The night-lock firmly clench'd, beside some grate"
3016,CANTO THIRD.,While the large lamp thro' the long corridors
3017,CANTO THIRD.,"Threw flickering light, the Chaplain often stood"
3018,CANTO THIRD.,Conversing. Of the criminal's past life
3019,CANTO THIRD.,"He made inquiry, and receiv'd replies"
3020,CANTO THIRD.,"Foreign from truth, or vague and taciturn:"
3021,CANTO THIRD.,"And added pious counsels, unobserv'd,"
3022,CANTO THIRD.,"Heeded but slightly, or ill understood."
3023,CANTO THIRD.,
3024,CANTO THIRD.,*   *   *   *   *
3025,CANTO THIRD.,
3026,CANTO THIRD.,"The leaden-footed weeks o'er Conrad pass'd,"
3027,CANTO THIRD.,With deadening weight.
3028,CANTO THIRD.,Privation bow'd his pride.
3029,CANTO THIRD.,"The lily-handed, smiting at the forge,"
3030,CANTO THIRD.,"Detested life, and meditated means"
3031,CANTO THIRD.,To accomplish suicide.
3032,CANTO THIRD.,"At dusk of eve,"
3033,CANTO THIRD.,"While in his cell, on darkest themes he mused,"
3034,CANTO THIRD.,"Before his grate, a veiled woman stood."
3035,CANTO THIRD.,
3036,CANTO THIRD.,"--She spake not, but her presence made him glad,--"
3037,CANTO THIRD.,A purer atmosphere seem'd breathing round
3038,CANTO THIRD.,To expand his shrivell'd heart.
3039,CANTO THIRD.,"Fair gifts she brought,"
3040,CANTO THIRD.,"Roses fresh-blown, and cates, and fragrant fruits"
3041,CANTO THIRD.,Most grateful to his fever'd lip.
3042,CANTO THIRD.,"""Oh speak!"
3043,CANTO THIRD.,"Speak to me!"""
3044,CANTO THIRD.,"But she glided light away,"
3045,CANTO THIRD.,"And heavenly sweet, her parting whisper said"
3046,CANTO THIRD.,"""Good night! With the new moon I'll come again."""
3047,CANTO THIRD.,
3048,CANTO THIRD.,*   *   *   *   *
3049,CANTO THIRD.,
3050,CANTO THIRD.,"""_With the new Moon!_"""
3051,CANTO THIRD.,Hope! hope! Its magic wand
3052,CANTO THIRD.,With phosphorescence ting'd that Stygian pool
3053,CANTO THIRD.,"Of chill despair, in which his soul had sank"
3054,CANTO THIRD.,"Lower and lower still. Now, at the forge"
3055,CANTO THIRD.,A blessed vision gleam'd. Its mystery woke
3056,CANTO THIRD.,The romance of his nature. Every day
3057,CANTO THIRD.,"Moved lighter on, and when he laid it down,"
3058,CANTO THIRD.,"It breathed ""_good night_!"" like a complacent child"
3059,CANTO THIRD.,Going to rest. One barrier less remain'd
3060,CANTO THIRD.,"Between him and the goal, and to each night"
3061,CANTO THIRD.,"A tarrying, tedious guest, he bade farewell,"
3062,CANTO THIRD.,"Like lover, counting toward his spousal-morn."
3063,CANTO THIRD.,
3064,CANTO THIRD.,*   *   *   *   *
3065,CANTO THIRD.,
3066,CANTO THIRD.,But _will she come_?
3067,CANTO THIRD.,"And then, he blamed the doubt."
3068,CANTO THIRD.,"His pulse beat quicker, as the old moon died."
3069,CANTO THIRD.,And when the slender sickle of pale gold
3070,CANTO THIRD.,"Cut the blue concave, by his grated door"
3071,CANTO THIRD.,Stood the veil'd visitant. The breath of flowers
3072,CANTO THIRD.,Foretold her coming. With their wealth she brought
3073,CANTO THIRD.,"Grapes in the cluster, and a clasped Book,"
3074,CANTO THIRD.,"The holiest, and the best."
3075,CANTO THIRD.,"""Show me thine eyes!"""
3076,CANTO THIRD.,"He pray'd. But still with undrawn veil, she gave"
3077,CANTO THIRD.,"The promise of return, in whisper sweet,"
3078,CANTO THIRD.,"""Good night! good night!"
3079,CANTO THIRD.,Wilt read my Book? and say
3080,CANTO THIRD.,"Oh Lamb of God, forgive!"""
3081,CANTO THIRD.,"So, by the lamp"
3082,CANTO THIRD.,"When tardy Evening still'd the din of toil,"
3083,CANTO THIRD.,"He read of Him who came to save the lost,"
3084,CANTO THIRD.,"Who touch'd the blind, and they receiv'd their sight,"
3085,CANTO THIRD.,"The dead young man, and raised him from his bier,"
3086,CANTO THIRD.,"Reproved the raging Sea, and it was still:"
3087,CANTO THIRD.,Deeds that his boyhood heard unheedingly.
3088,CANTO THIRD.,"But here, in this strange solitude of pain"
3089,CANTO THIRD.,"With different voice they spake. And as he read,"
3090,CANTO THIRD.,"The fragrance of the mignionette he loved,"
3091,CANTO THIRD.,"Press'd 'tween the pages, lured him onward still."
3092,CANTO THIRD.,
3093,CANTO THIRD.,*   *   *   *   *
3094,CANTO THIRD.,
3095,CANTO THIRD.,"Now, a new echo in his heart was born,"
3096,CANTO THIRD.,"And sometimes mid the weary task, and leer"
3097,CANTO THIRD.,"Of felon faces, ere he was aware"
3098,CANTO THIRD.,"From a compress'd unmurmuring lip, it broke,"
3099,CANTO THIRD.,_O Lamb of God!_ If still unquell'd Despair
3100,CANTO THIRD.,"Thrust up a rebel standard, down it fell"
3101,CANTO THIRD.,"At the o'er-powering sigh, _O Lamb of God!_"
3102,CANTO THIRD.,"And ere upon his pallet low, he sank,"
3103,CANTO THIRD.,"It sometimes breathed, ""_O Lamb of God, forgive!_"
3104,CANTO THIRD.,Like the taught lesson of a humbled child.
3105,CANTO THIRD.,
3106,CANTO THIRD.,*   *   *   *   *
3107,CANTO THIRD.,
3108,CANTO THIRD.,Yet duly as the silver vested moon
3109,CANTO THIRD.,Hiding awhile in the dark breast of night
3110,CANTO THIRD.,Return'd to take her regent watch again
3111,CANTO THIRD.,"Over our sleeping planet, softly came"
3112,CANTO THIRD.,"That shrouded visitant, preferring still"
3113,CANTO THIRD.,Like those who guard us lest we dash our foot
3114,CANTO THIRD.,"Against a stone, to do her blessed work"
3115,CANTO THIRD.,Unseen. And with the liberal gifts she brought
3116,CANTO THIRD.,"For body, and for soul, there seem'd to float"
3117,CANTO THIRD.,A legacy of holy themes and thoughts
3118,CANTO THIRD.,"Behind her, like an incense-stream. He mused"
3119,CANTO THIRD.,"Oft-times of patience, and the dying love"
3120,CANTO THIRD.,"Of our dear Lord, nor yet without remorse"
3121,CANTO THIRD.,"Of that unsullied Truth which Vice rejects,"
3122,CANTO THIRD.,And God requires.
3123,CANTO THIRD.,How beautiful is Truth!
3124,CANTO THIRD.,"Her right-lined course, amid the veering curves"
3125,CANTO THIRD.,"And tangents of the world, her open face"
3126,CANTO THIRD.,"Seeking communion with the scanning stars,"
3127,CANTO THIRD.,"Her grave, severe simplicity of speech"
3128,CANTO THIRD.,"Untrammelled by the wiles of rhetoric,"
3129,CANTO THIRD.,"By bribes of popular applause unbow'd,"
3130,CANTO THIRD.,In unison with Him she dwells who ruled
3131,CANTO THIRD.,"The tyranny of Chaos, with the words"
3132,CANTO THIRD.,"""_Let there be light!_"""
3133,CANTO THIRD.,Gladly we turn again
3134,CANTO THIRD.,To that fair mansion mid the rural vales
3135,CANTO THIRD.,Where first our song awoke. Advancing years
3136,CANTO THIRD.,Brought to its blessed Lady no regret
3137,CANTO THIRD.,Or weak complaint for what the hand of Time
3138,CANTO THIRD.,Had borne away. Enduring charms were hers
3139,CANTO THIRD.,"On which he laid no tax; the beaming smile,"
3140,CANTO THIRD.,"The voice of melody, the hand that mark'd"
3141,CANTO THIRD.,"Each day with deeds of goodness, and the heart"
3142,CANTO THIRD.,"That made God's gift of life more beautiful,"
3143,CANTO THIRD.,"The more prolong'd. Its griefs she counted gains,"
3144,CANTO THIRD.,"Since He who wisely will'd them cannot err,"
3145,CANTO THIRD.,And loves while He afflicts.
3146,CANTO THIRD.,Their dialect
3147,CANTO THIRD.,Was breathed in secret 'tween her soul and Him.
3148,CANTO THIRD.,"But toward mankind, her duties made more pure"
3149,CANTO THIRD.,"By the strong heat of their refining fires,"
3150,CANTO THIRD.,"Flow'd forth like molten gold. She sought the poor,"
3151,CANTO THIRD.,"Counsell'd the ignorant, consoled the sad,"
3152,CANTO THIRD.,"And made the happy happier, by her warmth"
3153,CANTO THIRD.,Of social sympathy. She loved to draw
3154,CANTO THIRD.,The young around her table; well she knew
3155,CANTO THIRD.,"To cheer and teach them, by the tale or song,"
3156,CANTO THIRD.,"Or sacred hymn, for music dwelt with her"
3157,CANTO THIRD.,Till life went out. It pleased her much to hear
3158,CANTO THIRD.,"Their innocent merriment, while from the flow"
3159,CANTO THIRD.,And swelling happiness of childhood's heart
3160,CANTO THIRD.,"So simply purchased, she herself imbibed"
3161,CANTO THIRD.,A fuller tide of fresh vitality.
3162,CANTO THIRD.,Her favor'd guests exultingly rehears'd
3163,CANTO THIRD.,"Their visits to ""the Lady,"" counting each"
3164,CANTO THIRD.,"A privilege, not having learned the creed"
3165,CANTO THIRD.,Which modern times inculcate in our land
3166,CANTO THIRD.,"That whatsoe'er is _old_, is _obsolete_."
3167,CANTO THIRD.,
3168,CANTO THIRD.,"--Still ever at her side, by night and day"
3169,CANTO THIRD.,"Was Bertha, entering into every plan,"
3170,CANTO THIRD.,"With zealous aid, assuming every care"
3171,CANTO THIRD.,"That brought a burden, catching every smile"
3172,CANTO THIRD.,"On the clear mirror of a loving heart,"
3173,CANTO THIRD.,"Which by reflection doubled. Thus they dwelt,"
3174,CANTO THIRD.,"Mother and daughter, in sweet fellowship,"
3175,CANTO THIRD.,One soul betwixt them. Filial piety
3176,CANTO THIRD.,Thrives best with generous natures. Here was nought
3177,CANTO THIRD.,"Of self to cheek it, so it richly bloom'd"
3178,CANTO THIRD.,"Like the life-tree, that yieldeth every month"
3179,CANTO THIRD.,"New fruits, still hiding mid its wealth of leaves"
3180,CANTO THIRD.,The balm of healing.
3181,CANTO THIRD.,In that peaceful home
3182,CANTO THIRD.,"The fair-haired orphan was a fount of joy,"
3183,CANTO THIRD.,Spreading her young heart like a tintless sheet
3184,CANTO THIRD.,"For Love to write on. Sporting 'mid the flowers,"
3185,CANTO THIRD.,"Caroling with the birds, or gliding light"
3186,CANTO THIRD.,"As fawn, her fine, elastic temperament"
3187,CANTO THIRD.,Took happiest coloring from each varying hour
3188,CANTO THIRD.,"Or changing duty. Kind, providing cares"
3189,CANTO THIRD.,Which younglings often thoughtlessly receive
3190,CANTO THIRD.,"Or thankless claim, she gratefully repaid"
3191,CANTO THIRD.,With glad obedience. Pleas'd was she to bear
3192,CANTO THIRD.,"Precocious part in household industry,"
3193,CANTO THIRD.,"Round shining bars to involve the shortening thread,"
3194,CANTO THIRD.,"And see the stocking grow, or side by side"
3195,CANTO THIRD.,With her loved benefactresses to work
3196,CANTO THIRD.,"Upon some garment for the ill-clad poor,"
3197,CANTO THIRD.,"With busy needle. As their almoner,"
3198,CANTO THIRD.,'Twas her delight to seek some lowly hut
3199,CANTO THIRD.,"And gliding thence, with noiseless footstep, leave"
3200,CANTO THIRD.,"With her kind dole, a wonder whence it came."
3201,CANTO THIRD.,--A heavenly blessing wrapp'd its wing around
3202,CANTO THIRD.,The adopted orphanage.
3203,CANTO THIRD.,Oh ye whose homes
3204,CANTO THIRD.,"Are childless, know ye not some little heart"
3205,CANTO THIRD.,"Collapsing, for the need of parent's love,"
3206,CANTO THIRD.,That ye might breathe upon? some outcast lamb
3207,CANTO THIRD.,That ye might shelter in your fold? content
3208,CANTO THIRD.,"To make the sad eye sparkle, guide the feet"
3209,CANTO THIRD.,"In duty's path, bring a new soul to Heaven,"
3210,CANTO THIRD.,"And take your payment from the Judge's Voice,"
3211,CANTO THIRD.,At the Last Day?
3212,CANTO THIRD.,"--A tireless tide of joy,"
3213,CANTO THIRD.,"A world of pleasure in the garden bound,"
3214,CANTO THIRD.,Open'd to Leonore. From the first glance
3215,CANTO THIRD.,"Of the frail Crocus through its snowy sheath,"
3216,CANTO THIRD.,"On, to the ripen'd gatherings of the Grape,"
3217,CANTO THIRD.,"And thorn-clad chestnut, all was sweet to her."
3218,CANTO THIRD.,"She loved to plant the seed and watch the germ,"
3219,CANTO THIRD.,"And nurse the tender leaflet like a babe,"
3220,CANTO THIRD.,And lead the tendril right. To her they seem'd
3221,CANTO THIRD.,Like living friends. She sedulously mark'd
3222,CANTO THIRD.,"Their health and order, and was skill'd to prune"
3223,CANTO THIRD.,"The too luxuriant spray, or gadding vine."
3224,CANTO THIRD.,"She taught the blushing Strawberry where to run,"
3225,CANTO THIRD.,"And stoop'd to kiss the timid Violet,"
3226,CANTO THIRD.,"Blossoming in the shade, and sometimes dream'd"
3227,CANTO THIRD.,"The Lily of the lakelet, calmly throned"
3228,CANTO THIRD.,"On its broad leaf, like Moses in his ark,"
3229,CANTO THIRD.,"Spake words to her. And so, as years fled by,"
3230,CANTO THIRD.,"Young Fancy, train'd by Nature, turn'd to God."
3231,CANTO THIRD.,"Her clear, Teutonic mind, took hold on truth"
3232,CANTO THIRD.,"And found in every season, change of joy."
3233,CANTO THIRD.,
3234,CANTO THIRD.,--Yet her prime pleasure seem'd at wintry eve
3235,CANTO THIRD.,"Tho' storms might fall, when from its branching arms"
3236,CANTO THIRD.,The antique candelabra shed fair light
3237,CANTO THIRD.,On polished wainscot and rich curtains dropp'd
3238,CANTO THIRD.,"Close o'er the casements, she might draw her seat"
3239,CANTO THIRD.,Near to her aged friend and take her hand
3240,CANTO THIRD.,"And frame her voice to join some tuneful song,"
3241,CANTO THIRD.,Treasuring whate'er of wise remark distill'd
3242,CANTO THIRD.,From those loved lips.
3243,CANTO THIRD.,"Then, as her Mentor spoke"
3244,CANTO THIRD.,"Of God's great goodness in this mortal life,"
3245,CANTO THIRD.,"Teaching us both by sorrow and by joy,"
3246,CANTO THIRD.,And how we ought to yield it back with trust
3247,CANTO THIRD.,"And not with dread, whenever He should call,"
3248,CANTO THIRD.,"Having such precious promises, through Christ"
3249,CANTO THIRD.,"Of gain unspeakable, beyond the grave,"
3250,CANTO THIRD.,The listening pupil felt her heart expand
3251,CANTO THIRD.,With reverent love.
3252,CANTO THIRD.,"Friendship, 'tween youth and age"
3253,CANTO THIRD.,"Is gain to both,--nor least to that which finds"
3254,CANTO THIRD.,The germs of knowledge and experience drop
3255,CANTO THIRD.,"And twine themselves around the unfrosted locks,"
3256,CANTO THIRD.,A fadeless coronet. In this sweet home
3257,CANTO THIRD.,"The lengthen'd day seem'd short for their delights,"
3258,CANTO THIRD.,And wintry evening brief. The historic page
3259,CANTO THIRD.,"Made vocal, brought large wealth to memory."
3260,CANTO THIRD.,"The lore of distant climes, that rose and fell"
3261,CANTO THIRD.,"Ere our New World, like Lazarus came forth,"
3262,CANTO THIRD.,"The napkin round her forehead, and sate down"
3263,CANTO THIRD.,Beside her startled sisters.
3264,CANTO THIRD.,"Last of all,"
3265,CANTO THIRD.,The large time-honor'd Bible loos'd its clasps
3266,CANTO THIRD.,And shed its manna on their waiting souls;
3267,CANTO THIRD.,"Then rose the sacred hymn in blended tones,"
3268,CANTO THIRD.,By Bertha's parlor-organ made intense
3269,CANTO THIRD.,"In melody of praise, and fervent Prayer"
3270,CANTO THIRD.,"Set its pure crown upon the parted day,"
3271,CANTO THIRD.,"And kiss'd the Angel, Sleep."
3272,CANTO THIRD.,Yet ere they rose
3273,CANTO THIRD.,"From bended knee, there was a lingering pause,"
3274,CANTO THIRD.,A silent orison for one whose name
3275,CANTO THIRD.,"But seldom pass'd their lips, though in their hearts"
3276,CANTO THIRD.,"His image with its faults and sorrows dwelt,"
3277,CANTO THIRD.,Invoking pity of a pardoning God.
3278,CANTO THIRD.,
3279,CANTO THIRD.,"--Thus fled the years away, the cultured glebe"
3280,CANTO THIRD.,"Stirr'd by the vernal plough-share, yielding charms"
3281,CANTO THIRD.,"To Summer, pouring wealth o'er Autumn's breast,"
3282,CANTO THIRD.,"Pausing from weary toil, when Winter comes,"
3283,CANTO THIRD.,"Bringing its Sabbath, as the man of eld"
3284,CANTO THIRD.,"With snow upon his temples, peaceful sits"
3285,CANTO THIRD.,"In his arm-chair, to ruminate and rest."

3290,CANTO THIRD.,"Befere the vernal equinox, at morn"
3291,CANTO THIRD.,"There was no movement in the Lady's room,"
3292,CANTO THIRD.,"Who prized the early hours like molten gold,"
3293,CANTO THIRD.,And ever rose before the kingly Sun.
3294,CANTO THIRD.,
3295,CANTO THIRD.,"--On the white pillow still reposed her head,"
3296,CANTO THIRD.,Her cheek upon her hand. She had retired
3297,CANTO THIRD.,"In health, affection's words, and trustful prayers"
3298,CANTO THIRD.,"Hallowing her lips. Now, on her brow there seem'd"
3299,CANTO THIRD.,"Unwonted smoothness, and the smile was there"
3300,CANTO THIRD.,"Set as a seal, with which the call she heard,"
3301,CANTO THIRD.,"""_Come! sister-spirit!_"""
3302,CANTO THIRD.,She had gain'd the wish
3303,CANTO THIRD.,"Oft utter'd to her God, to pass away"
3304,CANTO THIRD.,Without the sickness and enfeebled powers
3305,CANTO THIRD.,That tax the heart of love. Death that unbars
3306,CANTO THIRD.,"Unto the ready soul the Gate of Heaven,"
3307,CANTO THIRD.,"Claiming no pang or groan from failing flesh,"
3308,CANTO THIRD.,Doth angel-service.
3309,CANTO THIRD.,"But alas! the shock,"
3310,CANTO THIRD.,"The chill, the change, the anguish, where she dwelt,"
3311,CANTO THIRD.,And must return no more. As one amaz'd
3312,CANTO THIRD.,"The stricken daughter held her breath for awe,"
3313,CANTO THIRD.,God seem'd so near. Methought she saw the Hand
3314,CANTO THIRD.,"That smote her. Half herself was reft away,"
3315,CANTO THIRD.,Body and soul. Yet no repining word
3316,CANTO THIRD.,Announc'd her agony.
3317,CANTO THIRD.,The tolling bell
3318,CANTO THIRD.,"To hill and valley, told with solemn tongue"
3319,CANTO THIRD.,"That death had been among them, and at door"
3320,CANTO THIRD.,"And window listening, aged crone and child"
3321,CANTO THIRD.,"Counted its strokes, a stroke for every year,"
3322,CANTO THIRD.,"And predicated thence, as best they might,"
3323,CANTO THIRD.,"Whom they had lost. Neighbor of neighbor ask'd,"
3324,CANTO THIRD.,Till the sad tidings were possess'd by all.
3325,CANTO THIRD.,
3326,CANTO THIRD.,--A village funeral is a thing that warns
3327,CANTO THIRD.,"All from their homes. In the throng'd city's bound,"
3328,CANTO THIRD.,"Hearses unnoticed pass, and none inquire"
3329,CANTO THIRD.,Who goeth to his grave. But rural life
3330,CANTO THIRD.,Keepeth afresh the rills of sympathy.
3331,CANTO THIRD.,"True sorrow was there at these obsequies,"
3332,CANTO THIRD.,For all the poor were mourners. There the old
3333,CANTO THIRD.,"Came in the garments she had given, bow'd down"
3334,CANTO THIRD.,With their own sense of loss. O'er furrow'd cheeks
3335,CANTO THIRD.,In care-worn channels stole the trickling tear.
3336,CANTO THIRD.,"The young were weepers, for their memories stored"
3337,CANTO THIRD.,"Many a gentle word, and precept kind,"
3338,CANTO THIRD.,Like jewels dropp'd behind her. Mothers rais'd
3339,CANTO THIRD.,Their little ones above the coffin's side
3340,CANTO THIRD.,To look upon her face. Lingering they gazed
3341,CANTO THIRD.,Deeming the lovely Lady sweetly slept
3342,CANTO THIRD.,Among the flowers that on her pillow lay.
3343,CANTO THIRD.,
3344,CANTO THIRD.,*   *   *   *   *

3346,CANTO THIRD.,He's but a tyro in the school of grief
3347,CANTO THIRD.,Who hath not from the victor-tomb return'd
3348,CANTO THIRD.,Unto his rifled home. The utter weight
3349,CANTO THIRD.,Of whelming desolation doth not fall
3350,CANTO THIRD.,Till the last rites are paid. The cares of love
3351,CANTO THIRD.,"Having no longer scope, withdraw their shield,"
3352,CANTO THIRD.,"And even the seat whereon the lost one sate,"
3353,CANTO THIRD.,"The pen he held, the cup from which he drank,"
3354,CANTO THIRD.,Launch their keen darts against the festering soul.
3355,CANTO THIRD.,
3356,CANTO THIRD.,"--The lonely daughter, never since her birth"
3357,CANTO THIRD.,"Divided from the mother, having known"
3358,CANTO THIRD.,"No separate pleasure, or secreted thought,"
3359,CANTO THIRD.,With deep humility resumed her course
3360,CANTO THIRD.,"Of daily duty and philanthropy,"
3361,CANTO THIRD.,"Not murmuring, but remembering His great love"
3362,CANTO THIRD.,"Who lent so long that blessing beyond price,"
3363,CANTO THIRD.,And from her broken censer offering still
3364,CANTO THIRD.,Incense of praise.
3365,CANTO THIRD.,She deem'd it fearful loss
3366,CANTO THIRD.,"To lose a sorrow, be chastis'd in vain,"
3367,CANTO THIRD.,"Not yield our joys, but have them rent away,"
3368,CANTO THIRD.,And make this life a battle-field with God.
3369,CANTO THIRD.,
3370,CANTO THIRD.,The sombre shadow brooding o'er their home
3371,CANTO THIRD.,Was felt by all. The heart of Leonore
3372,CANTO THIRD.,"Dwindled and shrank beneath it. Vigor fled,"
3373,CANTO THIRD.,"The untastcd meal, and couch bedew'd with tears"
3374,CANTO THIRD.,"Gave the solution to her wasted flesh,"
3375,CANTO THIRD.,And drooping eye-lids.
3376,CANTO THIRD.,"Folded in her arms,"
3377,CANTO THIRD.,"Bertha with tender accents said, ""my child,"
3378,CANTO THIRD.,"We please not her who to the angels went,"
3379,CANTO THIRD.,By hopeless grief. Doubt not her watchful eye
3380,CANTO THIRD.,"Regards us, though unseen. How oft she taught"
3381,CANTO THIRD.,"To make God's will our own. You, who were glad"
3382,CANTO THIRD.,"To do her bidding then, distress her not"
3383,CANTO THIRD.,By disobedience now. Waste not the health
3384,CANTO THIRD.,"In reckless martyrdom, which Heaven hath link'd"

3398,CANTO THIRD.,"Fell by the wayside, struck by sudden Death"
3399,CANTO THIRD.,"That vice propels. A Man of God, who sought"
3400,CANTO THIRD.,Like his blest Master every form of woe
3401,CANTO THIRD.,"Found him, and to a shelter and a couch"
3402,CANTO THIRD.,"Convey'd. Then bending down, with earnest words"
3403,CANTO THIRD.,"For time grew short, he urg'd him to repent."
3404,CANTO THIRD.,"""Say, Lord have mercy on my soul."
3405,CANTO THIRD.,Look up
3406,CANTO THIRD.,"Unto the Lamb of God, for He can save"
3407,CANTO THIRD.,"Even to the uttermost."""
3408,CANTO THIRD.,Slight heed obtain'd
3409,CANTO THIRD.,"This adjuration, wild the glazing eye"
3410,CANTO THIRD.,"Fix'd on the wall,--and ever and anon"
3411,CANTO THIRD.,"The stiffening fingers clutch'd at things unseen,"
3412,CANTO THIRD.,"While from those spent lungs came a shuddering sound,"
3413,CANTO THIRD.,"""_That's he! That's he!"
3414,CANTO THIRD.,The old man! His grey hairs
3415,CANTO THIRD.,"Dabbled with blood!_"""
3416,CANTO THIRD.,"Then in a loud, long cry,"
3417,CANTO THIRD.,"Wrung out by torturing pain,"
3418,CANTO THIRD.,"""I struck the blow!"
3419,CANTO THIRD.,"I tell ye that I struck the blow, and scaped."
3420,CANTO THIRD.,"Conrad who bore the doom is innocent,"
3421,CANTO THIRD.,"Save fellowship with guilt."""
3422,CANTO THIRD.,And so he fled;
3423,CANTO THIRD.,"The voice of prayer around him, but the soul"
3424,CANTO THIRD.,Beyond its reach. The kneeling Pastor rose
3425,CANTO THIRD.,"Sadly, as when the Shepherd fails to snatch"
3426,CANTO THIRD.,A wanderer from the Lion.
3427,CANTO THIRD.,But the truth
3428,CANTO THIRD.,Couch'd in that dismal cry of parting life
3429,CANTO THIRD.,"He treasured up, and bore to those who held"
3430,CANTO THIRD.,Power to investigate and to reprieve;
3431,CANTO THIRD.,And authorized by them with gladness sought
3432,CANTO THIRD.,The gloomy prison. Conrad there he found
3433,CANTO THIRD.,"In sullen syncope of sickening thought,"
3434,CANTO THIRD.,And cautiously in measured terms disclosed
3435,CANTO THIRD.,His liberation. Wondering doubt look'd forth
3436,CANTO THIRD.,From eyes that opening wide and wider still
3437,CANTO THIRD.,Strain'd from their sockets. Yet the hand he took
3438,CANTO THIRD.,"That led him from the cell, and onward moved"
3439,CANTO THIRD.,Like Peter following his angel guide
3440,CANTO THIRD.,Deeming he saw a vision. As the bolts
3441,CANTO THIRD.,"Drew gratingly to let them pass, he seem'd"
3442,CANTO THIRD.,"To gather consciousness, and restless grew"
3443,CANTO THIRD.,"With an unspoken fear, lest at the last"
3444,CANTO THIRD.,"Some sterner turnkey, or gruff sentinel"
3445,CANTO THIRD.,Might bar their egress.
3446,CANTO THIRD.,When behind them closed.
3447,CANTO THIRD.,"The utmost barrier, and the sweet, fresh air"
3448,CANTO THIRD.,"So long witheld, fill'd his collapsing lungs,"
3449,CANTO THIRD.,"He shouted rapturously,"
3450,CANTO THIRD.,"""_Am I alive?_"
3451,CANTO THIRD.,"Or have I burst the gates of death, and found"
3452,CANTO THIRD.,"A second Eden?"""
3453,CANTO THIRD.,The unwonted sound
3454,CANTO THIRD.,"Of his own voice, freed from the drear constraint"
3455,CANTO THIRD.,"Of prison durance, swell'd his thrilling frame"
3456,CANTO THIRD.,"With strong and joyous impulse, for 'tis said"
3457,CANTO THIRD.,Long stifled utterance is torturing pain
3458,CANTO THIRD.,To organs train'd to speech.
3459,CANTO THIRD.,With one high leap
3460,CANTO THIRD.,Like an enfranchis'd steed he seem'd to throw
3461,CANTO THIRD.,His spirit-chain behind him. Then he took
3462,CANTO THIRD.,"The Pastor's offer'd arm, who led the way"
3463,CANTO THIRD.,"To his own house, and bade him bathe and change"
3464,CANTO THIRD.,"His prison garments, and repose that night"
3465,CANTO THIRD.,Under his roof.
3466,CANTO THIRD.,With thoughtful care he spoke
3467,CANTO THIRD.,"To his own household, kindly to receive"
3468,CANTO THIRD.,"The erring one,--""for we are sinners all,"
3469,CANTO THIRD.,And not upon our merits may depend
3470,CANTO THIRD.,"But on abounding grace."""
3471,CANTO THIRD.,So when the hour
3472,CANTO THIRD.,"Of cheerful supper summon'd to the board,"
3473,CANTO THIRD.,"He came among them as a comely guest,"
3474,CANTO THIRD.,Refresh'd and welcome. Pleasant converse cheer'd
3475,CANTO THIRD.,"The hospitable meal, and then withdrawn"
3476,CANTO THIRD.,"Into the quiet study 'mid the books,"
3477,CANTO THIRD.,That saintly good man with the hoary hair
3478,CANTO THIRD.,"Silvering his temples like a graceful crown,"
3479,CANTO THIRD.,Strove by wise counsel to encourage him
3480,CANTO THIRD.,"For life's important duties,"
3481,CANTO THIRD.,But he deem'd
3482,CANTO THIRD.,"A ban was on him, and a mark which all"
3483,CANTO THIRD.,Would scan who met him.
3484,CANTO THIRD.,"""He whose lot hath been"
3485,CANTO THIRD.,"With fiends in Pandemonium, must expect"

3487,CANTO THIRD.,"""Not so, my son!"
3488,CANTO THIRD.,"Wipe off the past, as a forgotten thing,"
3489,CANTO THIRD.,"Propitiate virtue, by forsaking vice."
3490,CANTO THIRD.,"The good will aid you, and a brighter day"
3491,CANTO THIRD.,Doubtless awaits you. Be not too much moved
3492,CANTO THIRD.,"By man's applause or blame, but ever look"
3493,CANTO THIRD.,"Unto a higher Judge."""
3494,CANTO THIRD.,Then there arose
3495,CANTO THIRD.,"A voice of supplication, so intense"
3496,CANTO THIRD.,"To the Great Pardoner, that He would send"
3497,CANTO THIRD.,His spirit down to change and purify
3498,CANTO THIRD.,"The erring heart, that those persuasive tones,"
3499,CANTO THIRD.,"So humble, yet so strangely eloquent"
3500,CANTO THIRD.,Breathed o'er the unhappy one like soothing spell
3501,CANTO THIRD.,"Of magic influence, and he slept that night"
3502,CANTO THIRD.,"With peace and hope, long exiled from his couch."
3503,CANTO THIRD.,
3504,CANTO THIRD.,*   *   *   *   *
3505,CANTO THIRD.,
3506,CANTO THIRD.,"A summer drive to one sequestered long,"
3507,CANTO THIRD.,Hath charms untold.
3508,CANTO THIRD.,"The common face of earth,"
3509,CANTO THIRD.,"The waving grass, the rustle of the leaves,"
3510,CANTO THIRD.,"Kiss'd by the zephyr, or by winged bird"
3511,CANTO THIRD.,"Disparted, as it finds its chirping nest,"
3512,CANTO THIRD.,"The murmur of the brooks, the low of herds,"
3513,CANTO THIRD.,"The ever-changing landscape, rock and stream,"
3514,CANTO THIRD.,And azure concave fleck'd with silver clouds
3515,CANTO THIRD.,"Awaken rapturous joy. This Conrad felt,"
3516,CANTO THIRD.,"While pleasure every kindling feature touch'd,"
3517,CANTO THIRD.,And every accent tuned. But when they saw
3518,CANTO THIRD.,"The fair ancestral roof through trees afar,"
3519,CANTO THIRD.,"Strong agony convuls'd him, and he cried,"
3520,CANTO THIRD.,"""_Not there! Not there!_"
3521,CANTO THIRD.,"First take me to _Her_ grave!"""
3522,CANTO THIRD.,"And so to that secluded spot they turn'd,"
3523,CANTO THIRD.,Where rest the silent dead.
3524,CANTO THIRD.,"On the green mound,"
3525,CANTO THIRD.,"His Mother's bed, with sobs and groans he fell,"
3526,CANTO THIRD.,And in his paroxysm of grief would fain
3527,CANTO THIRD.,"Have torn the turf-bound earth away, to reach"
3528,CANTO THIRD.,"The mouldering coffin. Then, a flood of tears,"
3529,CANTO THIRD.,"Heaven's blessed gift burst forth,"
3530,CANTO THIRD.,"""Oh weep, my Son!"
3531,CANTO THIRD.,These gushing tears shall help to wash away

3534,CANTO THIRD.,"And strong in heavenly trust, resolve to rise"
3535,CANTO THIRD.,"To a new life."""
3536,CANTO THIRD.,Still kneeling on the sod

3543,CANTO THIRD.,"And beaming brow, while the good Pastor said,"
3544,CANTO THIRD.,"""Thy Son was dead, but is alive again."""
3545,CANTO THIRD.,"A sweet voice answer'd,"
3546,CANTO THIRD.,"""Lost he was, and found!"
3547,CANTO THIRD.,"Oh, welcome home."""
3548,CANTO THIRD.,She would have folded him
3549,CANTO THIRD.,"In her embrace. But at her feet he fell,"
3550,CANTO THIRD.,"Clasping her knees, and bowing down his head,"
3551,CANTO THIRD.,Till she assured him that a mother's love
3552,CANTO THIRD.,Was in her heart.
3553,CANTO THIRD.,"""And there is joy in Heaven"

3567,CANTO THIRD.,"There are, who mix"

3571,CANTO THIRD.,Draw down his thoughts from God?
3572,CANTO THIRD.,"The mitred brow,"
3573,CANTO THIRD.,Doth it stoop low enough to find the souls

3575,CANTO THIRD.,Methinks ambitious honors might disturb
3576,CANTO THIRD.,"The man whose banner is the Cross of Christ,"
