28,THE DALBY BEAR,"There goes a bear on Dalby moors,"
29,THE DALBY BEAR,Oxen and horses he devours.
30,THE DALBY BEAR,
31,THE DALBY BEAR,The peasants are in deep distress
32,THE DALBY BEAR,The laidly bear should them oppress.
33,THE DALBY BEAR,
34,THE DALBY BEAR,"Their heads together at length they lay,"
35,THE DALBY BEAR,How they the bear might seize and slay.
36,THE DALBY BEAR,
37,THE DALBY BEAR,"They drove their porkers through the wood,"
38,THE DALBY BEAR,The bear turn'd round as he lay at food.
39,THE DALBY BEAR,
40,THE DALBY BEAR,Outspoke as best he could the bear:
41,THE DALBY BEAR,"""What kind of guests approach my lair?"""
42,THE DALBY BEAR,
43,THE DALBY BEAR,"Uprose the bear amain from his food,"
44,THE DALBY BEAR,A christian man before him stood.
45,THE DALBY BEAR,
46,THE DALBY BEAR,"A little hour together they fought,"
47,THE DALBY BEAR,The bear to the earth the man has brought.
48,THE DALBY BEAR,
49,THE DALBY BEAR,"Fast came a knight as he could make,"
50,THE DALBY BEAR,He heard the heart of the peasant break.
51,THE DALBY BEAR,
52,THE DALBY BEAR,The bear upon him fiercely glar'd;
53,THE DALBY BEAR,"""Thou needst not hurry, I'm prepar'd."""
54,THE DALBY BEAR,
55,THE DALBY BEAR,"""And thou by me shalt be stoutly met,"
56,THE DALBY BEAR,So thou may'st vapour and thou may'st threat.
57,THE DALBY BEAR,
58,THE DALBY BEAR,"""If thou hast spear and nimble hand,"
59,THE DALBY BEAR,"I've claws and teeth at my command."""
60,THE DALBY BEAR,
61,THE DALBY BEAR,"They fought for a day, they fought for two,"
62,THE DALBY BEAR,And so on the third they continu'd to do.
63,THE DALBY BEAR,
64,THE DALBY BEAR,"But when to night the fourth day drew,"
65,THE DALBY BEAR,The bear to the earth the warrior threw.
66,THE DALBY BEAR,
67,THE DALBY BEAR,"""Thou wilt no victory gain from me,"
68,THE DALBY BEAR,"Thou haughty knight, thou may'st certain be."
69,THE DALBY BEAR,
70,THE DALBY BEAR,"""I late was the son of a powerful King,"
71,THE DALBY BEAR,A Queen me into the world did bring.
72,THE DALBY BEAR,
73,THE DALBY BEAR,"""My Step-dame chang'd me, as you see,"
74,THE DALBY BEAR,She'd ruin me to eternity.
75,THE DALBY BEAR,
76,THE DALBY BEAR,"""About the wild forest I have run,"
77,THE DALBY BEAR,To the boors much scathe and violence done.
78,THE DALBY BEAR,
79,THE DALBY BEAR,"""In winter and in summer's tide"
80,THE DALBY BEAR,In peace for me they could not bide.
81,THE DALBY BEAR,
82,THE DALBY BEAR,"""But they may thank my cruel Dame,"
83,THE DALBY BEAR,For 'twas through her I a bear became.
84,THE DALBY BEAR,
85,THE DALBY BEAR,"""She plac'd around my neck so tight"
86,THE DALBY BEAR,An iron band in wrath and spite.
87,THE DALBY BEAR,
88,THE DALBY BEAR,"""If thou this accursed band canst break"
89,THE DALBY BEAR,"Thy life from thee I will not take."""
90,THE DALBY BEAR,
91,THE DALBY BEAR,"""O I will help thee from thy thrall;"
92,THE DALBY BEAR,Maria's son who has power for all
93,THE DALBY BEAR,
94,THE DALBY BEAR,"""Will loosen from thee this stubborn band,"
95,THE DALBY BEAR,"Full able thereto is his right hand."""
96,THE DALBY BEAR,
97,THE DALBY BEAR,"O'er him the cross the knight did make,"
98,THE DALBY BEAR,The iron burst from the bruin's neck.
99,THE DALBY BEAR,
100,THE DALBY BEAR,"He became a youth as fair as day,"
101,THE DALBY BEAR,His father's realm he went to sway.
102,THE DALBY BEAR,
103,THE DALBY BEAR,"A noble maid awaits the knight,"
104,THE DALBY BEAR,The hand of the Monarch's sister bright.
105,THE DALBY BEAR,
106,THE DALBY BEAR,"They liv'd together in honor and joy,"
107,THE DALBY BEAR,To the cruel Stepdame's great annoy.
108,THE DALBY BEAR,
109,THE DALBY BEAR,"A hard flint rock she soon became,"
110,THE DALBY BEAR,For herself she earn'd both woe and shame.

116,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
117,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
118,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,Down o'er the isle in torrents fell
119,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,On a Thursday morn the rain;
120,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,To fetch his bride now forth shall ride
121,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,Sir Tygge Hermandsen.
122,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
123,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"Sir Tygge out of the window look'd,"
124,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,The brooks ran boisterously;
125,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""To ride out now would bring me woe,"
126,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,So dear no bride I'll buy.
127,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
128,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""But hear thou, Nilaus Benditson,"
129,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,Long shanks has thy good steed;
130,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,I beg for the love of the God above
131,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"You'll fetch my bride with speed."""
132,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
133,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"Then answer'd Nilaus Benditson,"
134,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,In his sleeve thus answer'd he:
135,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""If me thou dispatch thy bride to fetch"
136,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"I'll trick thee certainly."""
137,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
138,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"It was Nilaus Benditson,"
139,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,He rode the bride to meet;
140,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,There hung silk sheen and sendal green
141,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,Before his courser's feet.
142,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
143,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"They clad themselves in silken cloth,"
144,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,And in cloth of gold beside;
145,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,In long array to the Kirk their way
146,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,They took with the youthful bride.
147,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
148,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,The bride before the holy Kirk door
149,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,Like a blooming rose did stand;
150,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"Oft did she turn to the water, to learn"
151,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,If the bridegroom was at hand.
152,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
153,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"Then answer'd Nilaus Benditson,"
154,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,He stood by the bride so close:
155,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""The brooks so roar'd that to cross the ford"
156,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"He fear'd would wet his hose."""
157,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
158,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,They plac'd the bride on the bridal bench
159,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,With pomp and honor high;
160,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,Oft would they turn to the water to learn
161,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,If the bridegroom bold drew nigh.
162,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
163,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"In the silver cup they skink the ale,"
164,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,And the nut-brown mead they pour;
165,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"Thus things they sped till day was fled,"
166,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,And until of bed the hour.
167,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
168,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"They lifted up the youthful bride,"
169,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,In the bride-bed her they set;
170,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"And there sat she for hours three,"
171,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,There came no bridegroom yet.
172,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
173,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"The priests before the bride-bed stood,"
174,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,And sang with all their might:
175,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""Who in the bed in the bridegroom's stead"
176,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"Shall sleep with the bride tonight?"""
177,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
178,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"Then forth stepp'd Nilaus Benditson,"
179,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,His lac'd shoe off flung he:
180,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""With the bride so bright I'll sleep tonight,"
181,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"And give her my troth with glee."""
182,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
183,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"So they the bridal solemnized,"
184,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,And glad themselves they made;
185,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"At home was then Tygge Hermandsen,"
186,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,To cross the brooks afraid.
187,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
188,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"It chanc'd upon a Wednesday,"
189,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,The waters began to fall;
190,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,Across came then Tygge Hermandsen
191,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,With his gay bridesmen all.
192,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
193,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,And he came to the bridal house
194,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"Where the feast was spread in state,"
195,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,Then up and cried the youthful bride:
196,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""Ride back, you come too late."""
197,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
198,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""Now hear, thou beauteous Sidselil,"
199,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"I've this to complain of thee,"
200,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,That thou hast ta'en another swain
201,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"And broke thy troth with me."""
202,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
203,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""Now hear, thou Tygge Hermandsen,"
204,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"Thou might'st have been aware,"
205,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,I would disdain to wed the swain
206,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,To wet his feet had fear.
207,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
208,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""If thou hadst been a Lady's swain,"
209,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"And hadst thou lov'd me true,"
210,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,With thy sword's stroke thou wouldst have broke
211,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"Thy way through the billows blue."""
212,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
213,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""To the cloyster I'll myself betake,"
214,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,And the monkish vow I'll swear;
215,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"For good or ill, proud Sidselil,"
216,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"I'll never more come here."""
217,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,
218,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"""But if hereby thy way shall lie"
219,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"When the brooks shall calmly run,"
220,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,If cheeses two in my store I view
221,TYGGE HERMANDSEN,"In thy sack I'll drop thee one."" {13}"
