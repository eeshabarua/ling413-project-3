30,MCMX,_While yet the light of Eastern skies_
31,MCMX,"_Was in my eyes,_"
32,MCMX,"_And still my heart, aglow with memories_"
33,MCMX,"_Of sun-enraptured seas,_"
34,MCMX,_And that old sea-girt town._
35,MCMX,"_Where, down dark alleys of enchanted night,_"
36,MCMX,"_We stole, until we came_"
37,MCMX,_To where the great dome glimmered white._
38,MCMX,"_And every minaret,_"
39,MCMX,"_A shaft of pearly flame,_"

54,AKRA THE SLAVE,
55,AKRA THE SLAVE,
56,AKRA THE SLAVE,He thought to see me tremble
57,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And totter as an oar-snapt reed,"
58,AKRA THE SLAVE,When he spake death to me--
59,AKRA THE SLAVE,"My courage, toppled in the dust,"
60,AKRA THE SLAVE,Even as the head of cactus
61,AKRA THE SLAVE,The camel-keeper slashes
62,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That his beasts may browse, unscathed,"
63,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The succulent, wounded green."
64,AKRA THE SLAVE,"He thought to have me, broken,"
65,AKRA THE SLAVE,And grovelling at his feet;
66,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Mouthing and mumbling to his sandal-ties,"
67,AKRA THE SLAVE,In stammering dread of death--
68,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Aye! even as a king,"
69,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Who, having from death’s hand,"
70,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Received his crown and kingdom,"
71,AKRA THE SLAVE,For ever treads in terror of the hour
72,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When death shall jog his elbow,"
73,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Twitch the purple from his shoulders,"
74,AKRA THE SLAVE,And claim again the borrowed crown.
75,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, little need have I to fear"
76,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The crouching, lean camp-follower,"
77,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Unto whose ever-gaping maw,"
78,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Day after day, I flung"
79,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The spoils of bow and arrow,"
80,AKRA THE SLAVE,Ere I was taken captive--
81,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I, who have often, at my mother’s breast,"
82,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Awakened in the night-time,"
83,AKRA THE SLAVE,"To see death leering on me from the cave-mouth,"
84,AKRA THE SLAVE,A gaunt and slinking shape
85,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That snuffed the dying embers,"
86,AKRA THE SLAVE,Blotting out the friendly stars--
87,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I, who, a scarce-weaned boy,"
88,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Have toddled, gay and fearless,"
89,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Down the narrow jungle-track,"
90,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Through bodeful forest-darkness, panther-eyed;"
91,AKRA THE SLAVE,And have felt cold snakes uncoiling
92,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And gliding ’neath my naked sole,"
93,AKRA THE SLAVE,From clammy slumber startled;
94,AKRA THE SLAVE,"While, with sharp snap and crackle,"
95,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Beast-trodden branches strained behind me,"
96,AKRA THE SLAVE,My father’s hand scarce snatching me
97,AKRA THE SLAVE,Before the spring of crouching death!
98,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, naught of this the King could know,"
99,AKRA THE SLAVE,"He only knew that, on that far-off morning,"
100,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When first I came before him, captive,"
101,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Among my captive brothers,"
102,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, as he lightly held, in idle fingers,"
103,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Above my unbowed head,"
104,AKRA THE SLAVE,In equal poise
105,AKRA THE SLAVE,Death’s freedom
106,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or the servitude of life,"
107,AKRA THE SLAVE,I clutched at life:
108,AKRA THE SLAVE,And cared but little that his lips
109,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Should curl, to see me, broken,"
110,AKRA THE SLAVE,A slave among his slaves.
111,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Yet, never slave of his was I;"
112,AKRA THE SLAVE,Nor did I take my new life from his nod--
113,AKRA THE SLAVE,I ... I who could have torn
114,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The proud life out of him,"
115,AKRA THE SLAVE,Before his guards could stay me...
116,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Had she not sat beside him, on her throne."
117,AKRA THE SLAVE,
118,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And he, who knew not then,"
119,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Nor ever, till to-day,"
120,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Has known me aught but slave,"
121,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Remembering that time,"
122,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Spake doom of death to me,"
123,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Idly, as to a slave:"
124,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And I await the end of night,"
125,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And dawn of death,"
126,AKRA THE SLAVE,Even as a slave awaits...
127,AKRA THE SLAVE,Nay! as the unvanquished veteran
128,AKRA THE SLAVE,Awaits the hour of victory.
129,AKRA THE SLAVE,
130,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In silence, wheels the night,"
131,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Star-marshalled, over dreaming Babylon;"
132,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And none in all the sleeping city stirs,"
133,AKRA THE SLAVE,Save the cloaked sentries on the outer walls
134,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Who tread out patience ’twixt the gates of brass,"
135,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Numb with scarce-baffled slumber,"
136,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or, maybe, some unsleeping priest of Bel,"
137,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A lonely warder of eternity,"
138,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Who watches on the temple’s seventh stage,"
139,AKRA THE SLAVE,With the unslumbering gods.
140,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Yet, may not she, the Queen,"
141,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Whose beauty, slaying my body,"
142,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Brings my soul to immortal birth,"
143,AKRA THE SLAVE,Although she does not know
144,AKRA THE SLAVE,Of my last vigil on the peak of life--
145,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Yet, may not she awaken, troubled"
146,AKRA THE SLAVE,"By strange, bewildering dreams,"
147,AKRA THE SLAVE,With heart a little fearful of the dawn
148,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of day, yet unrevealed?"
149,AKRA THE SLAVE,
150,AKRA THE SLAVE,"There is no sound at all,"
151,AKRA THE SLAVE,Save only the cool plashing
152,AKRA THE SLAVE,Of fountains in the courtyard
153,AKRA THE SLAVE,Without my lonely cell:
154,AKRA THE SLAVE,For fate has granted to me
155,AKRA THE SLAVE,"This last, least consolation of sweet sound"
156,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Though in the plains I perish,"
157,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I shall hear the noise of waters,"
158,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The noise of running waters,"
159,AKRA THE SLAVE,As I die.
160,AKRA THE SLAVE,My earliest lullaby shall sing
161,AKRA THE SLAVE,My heart again to slumber.
162,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, even now, I hear"
163,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Stream-voices, long-forgotten, calling me"
164,AKRA THE SLAVE,Back to the hills of home;
165,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, dreaming, I remember"
166,AKRA THE SLAVE,The little yellow brooks
167,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That ever, day and night,"
168,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Gush down the mountains singing,"
169,AKRA THE SLAVE,Singing by the caves:
170,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And hearkening unto them,"
171,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Once more a tiny baby,"
172,AKRA THE SLAVE,A wee brown fist I dabble
173,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In the foaming cool,"
174,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Frothing round my wrist,"
175,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Spurting up my arm,"
176,AKRA THE SLAVE,Spraying my warm face;
177,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And then again I chuckle,"
178,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As I see an empty gourd,"
179,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Fallen in the swirling waters,"
180,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Bobbing on the tawny eddies,"
181,AKRA THE SLAVE,Swiftly out of sight.
182,AKRA THE SLAVE,
183,AKRA THE SLAVE,And yet most clearly to remembrance comes
184,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That far-off night, in early Spring,"
185,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When, loud with melted snow from Northern peaks,"
186,AKRA THE SLAVE,The torrent roared and fretted;
187,AKRA THE SLAVE,"While, couched within the cavern,"
188,AKRA THE SLAVE,The clamour kept me wakeful;
189,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, even when I slept,"
190,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Tumbled, tumultuous, through my dreams,"
191,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And seemed to surge about me,"
192,AKRA THE SLAVE,As the brawl of armèd men.
193,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And once I sprang from slumber,"
194,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Hot and startled,"
195,AKRA THE SLAVE,Dreaming that I felt
196,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A warm breath on my cheek,"
197,AKRA THE SLAVE,As if a jackal nuzzled me;
198,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or some dread, slinking foe"
199,AKRA THE SLAVE,Made certain of my sleeping
200,AKRA THE SLAVE,Before he plunged the steel.
201,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But nothing stirred within the glimmering cavern,"
202,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Where, all around me, lay my sleeping kindred;"
203,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, when I stole without, with noiseless footsteps,"
204,AKRA THE SLAVE,"To rouse the smouldering watchfire into flame,"
205,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And cast fresh, crackling brushwood on the blaze,"
206,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I caught no glint of arms betwixt the branches,"
207,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Nor any sound or rumour, save"
208,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The choral noise of cold hill-waters,"
209,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Cold hill-waters singing,"
210,AKRA THE SLAVE,Singing to the stars.
211,AKRA THE SLAVE,And so I turned me from the brooding night;
212,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, couched again upon the leopard-skins,"
213,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I slept, till dawn, in dream-untroubled sleep."
214,AKRA THE SLAVE,
215,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I woke to see the cold sky kindling red,"
216,AKRA THE SLAVE,Beyond the mounded ash of the spent fire;
217,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And lay, a moment, watching"
218,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The pearly light, caught, trembling,"
219,AKRA THE SLAVE,In dewy-beaded spiders’ webs
220,AKRA THE SLAVE,About the cave-mouth woven.
221,AKRA THE SLAVE,Then I arose;
222,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And left my kindred, slumbering--"
223,AKRA THE SLAVE,"My mother, by my father,"
224,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, at her breast, her youngest babe,"
225,AKRA THE SLAVE,With dimpled fingers clutching at her bosom;
226,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, all around them, lying"
227,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Their sons and daughters, beautiful in sleep,"
228,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With parted lips,"
229,AKRA THE SLAVE,And easy limbs outstretched
230,AKRA THE SLAVE,Along the tumbled bedskins:
231,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And while they slumbered yet in shades of night,"
232,AKRA THE SLAVE,I sprang out naked
233,AKRA THE SLAVE,Into eager dawn.
234,AKRA THE SLAVE,The sun had not yet scaled the eastern ridge:
235,AKRA THE SLAVE,And still the vales were hidden from my eyes
236,AKRA THE SLAVE,By snowy wreaths of swathing mist:
237,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, high upon a scar"
238,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That jutted sheer and stark,"
239,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In cold grey light,"
240,AKRA THE SLAVE,"There stood an antelope,"
241,AKRA THE SLAVE,With lifted muzzle snuffing the fresh day;
242,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When scenting me afar,"
243,AKRA THE SLAVE,He plunged into the mist
244,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With one quick, startled bound:"
245,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, from the smoking vapour,"
246,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Arose a gentle pattering,"
247,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As, down the rocky trail,"
248,AKRA THE SLAVE,The unseen herd went trotting
249,AKRA THE SLAVE,Upon their leader’s heels.
250,AKRA THE SLAVE,And from the clear horizon
251,AKRA THE SLAVE,The exultant sun sprang god-like:
252,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And on a little mound I stood,"
253,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With eager arms outstretched,"
254,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That, over my cold body,"
255,AKRA THE SLAVE,The first warm golden beams
256,AKRA THE SLAVE,Of his life-giving light might fall.
257,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And thus, awhile, I stood."
258,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In radiant adoration tranced,"
259,AKRA THE SLAVE,Until I caught the call of waters;
260,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, running downwards to the stream,"
261,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That plunged into a darkling pool,"
262,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Where, in the rock was scooped a wide, deep basin;"
263,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Upon the glassy brink,"
264,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A moment, I hung, shivering,"
265,AKRA THE SLAVE,And gazing down through deeps of lucent shadow;
266,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And then I leapt headlong,"
267,AKRA THE SLAVE,And felt the cloven waters
268,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Closing, icy-cold, above me,"
269,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, again, with sobbing breath,"
270,AKRA THE SLAVE,Battled to the light and air:
271,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And I ran into the sunshine,"
272,AKRA THE SLAVE,Shaking from my tingling limbs
273,AKRA THE SLAVE,Showers of scintillating drops
274,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Over radiant, dewy beds"
275,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of the snowy cyclamen,"
276,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And dark-red anemone,"
277,AKRA THE SLAVE,Till my tawny body glowed
278,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With warm, ruddy, pulsing life."
279,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And then again I sought the stream,"
280,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And plunged; and now, more boldly,"
281,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I crossed the pool, with easy stroke;"
282,AKRA THE SLAVE,And climbed the further crag;
283,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, turning, plunged again."
284,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And so, I dived and swam,"
285,AKRA THE SLAVE,Till pangs of hunger pricked
286,AKRA THE SLAVE,My idle fancy homeward:
287,AKRA THE SLAVE,And eagerly I climbed the hill;
288,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When, not a sling’s throw from the cavern,"
289,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Stooping to pluck a red anemone,"
290,AKRA THE SLAVE,"To prank the wet, black tangle of my hair,"
291,AKRA THE SLAVE,I heard a shout;
292,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And looking up,"
293,AKRA THE SLAVE,I saw strange men
294,AKRA THE SLAVE,With lifted spears
295,AKRA THE SLAVE,Bear down on me:
296,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And as I turned,"
297,AKRA THE SLAVE,A javelin sang
298,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Above my shrinking shoulder,"
299,AKRA THE SLAVE,And bit the ground before me.
300,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, swift as light I sped,"
301,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Until I reached the pool,"
302,AKRA THE SLAVE,And leapt therein:
303,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And he who pressed most hotly on my heels,"
304,AKRA THE SLAVE,Fell stumbling after.
305,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Still I never slackened,"
306,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Although I heard a floundering splash,"
307,AKRA THE SLAVE,And then the laughter of his comrades:
308,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, as I swam for life,"
309,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Betwixt my thrusting heels,"
310,AKRA THE SLAVE,Another spear that clove the crystal waters
311,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Glanced underneath my body,"
312,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And in the stream-bed quivered bolt upright,"
313,AKRA THE SLAVE,Caught in a cleft of rock.
314,AKRA THE SLAVE,With frantic arm I struck
315,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Straight as a snake across the pool,"
316,AKRA THE SLAVE,And climbed the further bank;
317,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And plunging through deep brake,"
318,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Ran wildly onward,"
319,AKRA THE SLAVE,Startling as I went
320,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A browsing herd of antelope,"
321,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That, bounding, fled before me down the valley"
322,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And after them I raced,"
323,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As though the hunter,"
324,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Not the hunted,"
325,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Until the chase sang in my blood,"
326,AKRA THE SLAVE,And braced my straining thews.
327,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I knew not if men followed,"
328,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Yet, on I sped, impetuously,"
329,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As speeds the fleet-foot onaga,"
330,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That breasts the windy morning,"
331,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With lifted head, and nostrils wide,"
332,AKRA THE SLAVE,Exultant in his youth.
333,AKRA THE SLAVE,"So, on and ever on,"
334,AKRA THE SLAVE,Scarce knowing why I ran--
335,AKRA THE SLAVE,Enough for me to feel
336,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Earth beaten back behind my heels,"
337,AKRA THE SLAVE,And hear the loud air singing
338,AKRA THE SLAVE,The blood-song in my ears:
339,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Till, stumbling headlong over"
340,AKRA THE SLAVE,"An unseen, fallen branch,"
341,AKRA THE SLAVE,I rolled in a deep bed of withered leaves;
342,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And lay, full-length in shuddering ecstasy"
343,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of hot, tumultuous blood that rioted"
344,AKRA THE SLAVE,Through every throbbing vein.
345,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But when again, I breathed more easily,"
346,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And my wild, fluttering heart kept slower beat,"
347,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Hot-foot, my thoughts ran, wondering, backward:"
348,AKRA THE SLAVE,And I arose and followed them
349,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With swift and stealthy pace,"
350,AKRA THE SLAVE,Until I reached the stream.
351,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Along the bank I stole with wary step,"
352,AKRA THE SLAVE,Until I came to where the waters
353,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Narrowed, raging through a gorge,"
354,AKRA THE SLAVE,Nigh the threshold of my home:
355,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And across the thunderous flood,"
356,AKRA THE SLAVE,From crag to crag I leapt:
357,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And then I climbed a cedar,"
358,AKRA THE SLAVE,From whose close ambush I could watch
359,AKRA THE SLAVE,Who came or went about the cavern-mouth.
360,AKRA THE SLAVE,I lay along a level branch:
361,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, through the thick, dark screen,"
362,AKRA THE SLAVE,I peered with eager eyes:
363,AKRA THE SLAVE,But no one crossed my sight.
364,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The whole land lay before me, drowsing"
365,AKRA THE SLAVE,In deepest noonday slumber:
366,AKRA THE SLAVE,No twig stirred in the breathless blaze;
367,AKRA THE SLAVE,And underneath the boughs no serpent rustled:
368,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, in the earth and air,"
369,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Naught waked, save one lone eagle, nigh the sun,"
370,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With wings, unbaffled, beating"
371,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Up the blue, unclouded heavens."
372,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A dreamless, suave security"
373,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Seemed brooding o’er the valley’s golden slumber,"
374,AKRA THE SLAVE,Whence rang or flashed no hint of lurking peril.
375,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I dropped to earth,"
376,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And crouching low,"
377,AKRA THE SLAVE,I stole yet nearer
378,AKRA THE SLAVE,Through the brake:
379,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Till, drawing nigh the cavern-mouth,"
380,AKRA THE SLAVE,I heard the sound of half-hushed sobbing:
381,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And then I saw, within the gloom,"
382,AKRA THE SLAVE,My mother and my sisters clustering round
383,AKRA THE SLAVE,"My father’s body, lying stark and dead,"
384,AKRA THE SLAVE,A spear-wound in his breast.
385,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And as I crept to them, they did not hear me,"
386,AKRA THE SLAVE,Nor ever lift their heads;
387,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, shuddering, crouched together,"
388,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With drooping breasts half-hid in falling hair,"
389,AKRA THE SLAVE,By that familiar form
390,AKRA THE SLAVE,In such strange slumber bound.
391,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Only the baby, on her shoulder slung,"
392,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Saw me, and crowed me greeting,"
393,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As I stooped down to touch my weeping mother,"
394,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Who, turning suddenly,"
395,AKRA THE SLAVE,With wild tear-fevered eyes;
396,AKRA THE SLAVE,Arose with whispered warning;
397,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, even then, too late."
398,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Already, from behind,"
399,AKRA THE SLAVE,Around my throat
400,AKRA THE SLAVE,An arm was flung;
401,AKRA THE SLAVE,And heavily I fell:
402,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Yet, with a desperate wrench,"
403,AKRA THE SLAVE,I slipped the clutch of my assailant:
404,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And picking up a slingstone that lay handy,"
405,AKRA THE SLAVE,I crashed it through his helm;
406,AKRA THE SLAVE,And dead he dropped.
407,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And now upon me all his fellows thronged,"
408,AKRA THE SLAVE,Like hounds about an antelope;
409,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And gripped my naked limbs,"
410,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And dragged me down,"
411,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A struggling beast, among them:"
412,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And desperately I fought,"
413,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As fights the boar at bay,"
414,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When all the yelling pack,"
415,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With lathered lips, and white teeth gnashing,"
416,AKRA THE SLAVE,Is closing in upon him;
417,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And in his quivering flank, and gasping throat,"
418,AKRA THE SLAVE,He feels the fangs of death:
419,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Till, overcome at last,"
420,AKRA THE SLAVE,"They bound me hand and foot,"
421,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With knotted, leathern thongs;"
422,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And dragged me out to where, beneath the trees,"
423,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Trussed in like manner, with defiant eyes,"
424,AKRA THE SLAVE,"My brothers lay, already, side by side."
425,AKRA THE SLAVE,They laid me in the shade;
426,AKRA THE SLAVE,And flicked my wincing spirit
427,AKRA THE SLAVE,With laughter and light words:
428,AKRA THE SLAVE,"""Now is the roe-buck taken!"""
429,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Then another,"
430,AKRA THE SLAVE,"On whose dark, sullen face there burned a livid weal"
431,AKRA THE SLAVE,"""A buck in flight’s a panther brought to bay!"""
432,AKRA THE SLAVE,And then his fellow:
433,AKRA THE SLAVE,"""True enough! and yet,"
434,AKRA THE SLAVE,For such young thews they give good gold--
435,AKRA THE SLAVE,"They give good gold in Babylon!"""
436,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, laughing thus, they left us,"
437,AKRA THE SLAVE,"To lie through hours of aching silence,"
438,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Until, at length, the cool of evening fell;"
439,AKRA THE SLAVE,When they returned from slumber;
440,AKRA THE SLAVE,And loosed the ankle-cords that we might stand;
441,AKRA THE SLAVE,And bade our mother feed us;
442,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And she, with tender fingers, held"
443,AKRA THE SLAVE,The milk-bowl to our parching lips;
444,AKRA THE SLAVE,And thrust dried dates betwixt our teeth;
445,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And wept, to see us standing there,"
446,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With helpless hands, before her."
447,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Then, bringing out their mules, they saddled them;"
448,AKRA THE SLAVE,And tied us to the girths on either hand.
449,AKRA THE SLAVE,They drove my weeping sisters from the cavern;
450,AKRA THE SLAVE,And sought to tear my mother from her home;
451,AKRA THE SLAVE,But she escaped them;
452,AKRA THE SLAVE,And they let her bide
453,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Amid the ruins of her life,"
454,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Whose light had dropped, so suddenly,"
455,AKRA THE SLAVE,From out the highest heavens:
456,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, when I turned to look on her,"
457,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And win from her a last farewell,"
458,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I saw her, sitting desolate betwixt"
459,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Her silent husband and her wailing babe,"
460,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With still, strange eyes,"
461,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That stared upon the dead, unseeing,"
462,AKRA THE SLAVE,"While her own children went from her,"
463,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Scarce knowing that they left her, nevermore"
464,AKRA THE SLAVE,To look upon her face.
465,AKRA THE SLAVE,
466,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Thus, we set out, as over"
467,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The darkening, Southern crags"
468,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The new moon’s keen, curved blade was thrust:"
469,AKRA THE SLAVE,"My sisters trooping on before us,"
470,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Like a drove of young gazelles,"
471,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Which, in the dead of night,"
472,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With pards in leash, and torches flaring,"
473,AKRA THE SLAVE,The hunters have encompassed.
474,AKRA THE SLAVE,"They moved with timid steps,"
475,AKRA THE SLAVE,And little runs;
476,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Stumbling, with stifled cries;"
477,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And starting, panic-shot,"
478,AKRA THE SLAVE,From every lurking shadow--
479,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Behind them, terror’s lifted lash:"
480,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Before them, ever crouching,"
481,AKRA THE SLAVE,The horror of the unknown night--
482,AKRA THE SLAVE,"While, as they moved before us,"
483,AKRA THE SLAVE,The moonlight shivered off their shrinking shoulders
484,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And naked, glancing limbs,"
485,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In shimmering, strange beauty."
486,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And closely on their heels,"
487,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I, with my brothers, foremost in the file,"
488,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Marched, tethered ’twixt the plodding beasts,"
489,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Whose stolid riders sat,"
490,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Each with his javelin on the pummel couched,"
491,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In watchful silence, with dark eyes alert."
492,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And once, nigh driven crazy"
493,AKRA THE SLAVE,"By the tugging of the thongs,"
494,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I sprang into the air,"
495,AKRA THE SLAVE,As down a rocky steep we scrambled;
496,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And strove to burst the galling bonds,"
497,AKRA THE SLAVE,Or hurl my guards on one another;
498,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, all too sure of foot, the beasts,"
499,AKRA THE SLAVE,And too securely girths and cords
500,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Held me, and I stumbled."
501,AKRA THE SLAVE,Instantly a thong
502,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Struck my wincing shoulders,"
503,AKRA THE SLAVE,Blow on thudding blow.
504,AKRA THE SLAVE,I bit my lips; and strode on silently;
505,AKRA THE SLAVE,Nor fought again for freedom.
506,AKRA THE SLAVE,"So on we journeyed through the night,"
507,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And down familiar mountain-tracks,"
508,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Through deep, dark forest,"
509,AKRA THE SLAVE,Ever down and down;
510,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Fording the streams, whose moon-bright waters flowed,"
511,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In eddies of delicious, aching cool,"
512,AKRA THE SLAVE,About our weary thighs.
513,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, once, when in mid-torrent,"
514,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That swirled, girth-high about the plunging beasts,"
515,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A startled otter, glancing"
516,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Before their very hoofs,"
517,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Affrighted them; and, rearing,"
518,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With blind and desperate floundering,"
519,AKRA THE SLAVE,They nearly dragged us down to death:
520,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, ere we righted,"
521,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With a fearful cry,"
522,AKRA THE SLAVE,My eldest sister from the bevy broke;
523,AKRA THE SLAVE,And struck down-stream
524,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With wild arm lashing desperately,"
525,AKRA THE SLAVE,Until the current caught her;
526,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And she sank, to rise no more."
527,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And on again we travelled,"
528,AKRA THE SLAVE,Down through the darkling woodlands:
529,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And once I saw green, burning eyes,"
530,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Where, on a low-hung bough,"
531,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A night-black panther crouched,"
532,AKRA THE SLAVE,As though to pounce upon my sisters;
533,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, the sudden crack of whips,"
534,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Startling him, he snarled;"
535,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And turned with lashing tail,"
536,AKRA THE SLAVE,Crashing through dense brushwood.
537,AKRA THE SLAVE,
538,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When, once, again we came unto a clearing,"
539,AKRA THE SLAVE,The night was near its noon:
540,AKRA THE SLAVE,And all the vales that lay before us
541,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Were filled with moving, moonlit mists,"
542,AKRA THE SLAVE,That seemed phantasmal waters
543,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of that enchanted world,"
544,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Where we, in dreams, sail over still lagoons,"
545,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Throughout eternal night,"
546,AKRA THE SLAVE,And under unknown stars.
547,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Still, on we fared, unresting,"
548,AKRA THE SLAVE,Until the low moon paled;
549,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When, halting on a mountain-spur,"
550,AKRA THE SLAVE,"We first looked down on Babylon,"
551,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Far in the dreaming West,"
552,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A cluster of dim towers,"
553,AKRA THE SLAVE,Scarce visible to wearied eyes.
554,AKRA THE SLAVE,We camped within a sheltering cedar-grove;
555,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And all the day, beneath the level boughs,"
556,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Upon the agelong-bedded needles lay,"
557,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Half-slumbering, with fleeting, fretful dreams"
558,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That could not quite forget the chafing cords,"
559,AKRA THE SLAVE,That held our arms in aching numbness:
560,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, ere the noon, in sounder sleep I sank,"
561,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Dreaming I floated on a still, deep pool,"
562,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Beneath dark, overhanging branches;"
563,AKRA THE SLAVE,And seemed to feel upon my cheek
564,AKRA THE SLAVE,The cool caress of waters;
565,AKRA THE SLAVE,"While, far above me, through the night of trees,"
566,AKRA THE SLAVE,Noon glimmered faintly as the glint of stars.
567,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As thus I lay, in indolent ecstasy,"
568,AKRA THE SLAVE,"O’er me, suddenly, the waters"
569,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Curved, and I was dragged,"
570,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Down and down,"
571,AKRA THE SLAVE,Through gurgling deeps
572,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of swirling, drowning darkness..."
573,AKRA THE SLAVE,When I awoke in terror;
574,AKRA THE SLAVE,And strove to sit upright;
575,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, tautly, with a jerk,"
576,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The thongs that held me to my brothers,"
577,AKRA THE SLAVE,Dragged me back to earth.
578,AKRA THE SLAVE,
579,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Awhile I lay, with staring eyes, awake,"
580,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Watching a big, grey spider, crouched overhead,"
581,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In ambush ’neath a twig, beside her web,"
582,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Oft sallying out, to bind yet more securely,"
583,AKRA THE SLAVE,The half-entangled flies.
584,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And then, once more, I slumbered;"
585,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And dreamed a face leant over me,"
586,AKRA THE SLAVE,More fair than any face
587,AKRA THE SLAVE,My waking eyes had ever looked upon.
588,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Its beauty burned above me,"
589,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Not dusky like my sisters’ faces,"
590,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But pale as the wan moon,"
591,AKRA THE SLAVE,Reflected in a flood
592,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of darkly flowing waters,"
593,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or as the creaming froth,"
594,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That, born amid the thunder of the fall,"
595,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Floats on the river’s bosom in the sunshine,"
596,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Bubble after bubble,"
597,AKRA THE SLAVE,Perishing in air.
598,AKRA THE SLAVE,"So, a moment, over me,"
599,AKRA THE SLAVE,With frail and fleeting glimmer
600,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of strange elusive, evanescent light,"
601,AKRA THE SLAVE,The holy vision hovered.
602,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And yet, whenever, with a fervent longing,"
603,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I sought to look into the darkling eyes,"
604,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The face would fade from me,"
605,AKRA THE SLAVE,As foam caught in an eddy:
606,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Until, at last, I wakened,"
607,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, wondering, saw a pale star gleaming"
608,AKRA THE SLAVE,Betwixt the cedar-branches.
609,AKRA THE SLAVE,And soon our captors stirred:
610,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And we arose, to see"
611,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The walls and towers of Babylon, dark"
612,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Against the clear rose of the afterglow,"
613,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Already in the surge of shadows caught,"
614,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As night, beneath us, slowly Westward swept,"
615,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Flooding the dreaming plain that lay before us,"
616,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Vast, limitless, bewildering,"
617,AKRA THE SLAVE,And strange to mountain-eyes.
618,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As down the slope we went,"
619,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And when, at last, we left behind"
620,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The hills and singing waters,"
621,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A vague, oppressive fear"
622,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of those dim, silent leagues of level land,"
623,AKRA THE SLAVE,Fell on me; and I almost seemed
624,AKRA THE SLAVE,To bear upon my shoulders
625,AKRA THE SLAVE,The vaster dome of overwhelming night;
626,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, trembling like a child,"
627,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I looked askance at my two captors,"
628,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As they rode on in heedless silence,"
629,AKRA THE SLAVE,Their swarthy faces sharp
630,AKRA THE SLAVE,Against the lucent sky.
631,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And then, once more,"
632,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The old, familiar watchfires of the stars"
633,AKRA THE SLAVE,Brought courage to my bosom;
634,AKRA THE SLAVE,And the young moon’s brilliant horn
635,AKRA THE SLAVE,Was exalted in the sky:
636,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And soon, the glooming wilderness"
637,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Awoke with glittering waters,"
638,AKRA THE SLAVE,As a friendly wind sang unto me
639,AKRA THE SLAVE,Among the swaying reeds:
640,AKRA THE SLAVE,"While, cloud on cloud,"
641,AKRA THE SLAVE,The snowy flocks of pelican
642,AKRA THE SLAVE,Before our coming rose;
643,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, as they swerved to Southward,"
644,AKRA THE SLAVE,The moonlight shivered off their flashing pinions.
645,AKRA THE SLAVE,
646,AKRA THE SLAVE,"So, on we marched, till dawn, across the plain;"
647,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, on and on,"
648,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Beneath the waxing moon,"
649,AKRA THE SLAVE,Each night we travelled Westward;
650,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Until, at last, we halted"
651,AKRA THE SLAVE,By the broad dull-gleaming flood
652,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of mighty, roaring Tigris;"
653,AKRA THE SLAVE,And aroused from midnight slumber
654,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The surly, grumbling ferrymen,"
655,AKRA THE SLAVE,And crossed the swollen waters
656,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Upon the great, skin rafts:"
657,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Then on again we fared,"
658,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Until the far, dim towers soared in the dawnlight"
659,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And we encamped beside a stream,"
660,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Beneath dry, rustling palms."
661,AKRA THE SLAVE,And heavily I slumbered:
662,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And only wakened once, at noon,"
663,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When, lifting up my head,"
664,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I saw the towers of Babylon, burning blue,"
665,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Far off, in the blind heat:"
666,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And slept again, till sunset,"
667,AKRA THE SLAVE,When we took our Westward course
668,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Along the low bank of a broad canal,"
669,AKRA THE SLAVE,That glimmered wanly ’neath a moonless sky.
670,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Higher, and higher still,"
671,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As we drew slowly nearer,"
672,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Arose the vasty walls and serried towers,"
673,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That seemed to thrust among the stars,"
674,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And on embattled summits bear the night,"
675,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Unbowed beneath their burden,"
676,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As easily as, with unruffled brows,"
677,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And limber, upright bodies,"
678,AKRA THE SLAVE,The village-daughters carry
679,AKRA THE SLAVE,"At eve the brimming pitchers,"
680,AKRA THE SLAVE,Poised upon their heads.
681,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And when, above us, the wide-looming walls"
682,AKRA THE SLAVE,Shut out the Western stars;
683,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Beneath their shade, at midnight, we encamped,"
684,AKRA THE SLAVE,To await till dawn should open
685,AKRA THE SLAVE,The city gates for us.
686,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That night we did not sleep,"
687,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, crouched upon the ground,"
688,AKRA THE SLAVE,"We watched the moon rise over Babylon,"
689,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Till, far behind us, o’er the glittering waste,"
690,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Was flung the wall’s huge shadow,"
691,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And the moving shades of sentries,"
692,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Who, unseen above our heads,"
693,AKRA THE SLAVE,Paced through the night incessantly.
694,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Thus long we sat, hushed with awed expectation,"
695,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And gazing o’er the plain that we had travelled,"
696,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As, gradually, the climbing moon,"
697,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Escaping from the clustering towers,"
698,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Revealed far-gleaming waters,"
699,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And the sharp, shrill cry of owls,"
700,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Sweeping by on noiseless plumes,"
701,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Assailed the vasty silence,"
702,AKRA THE SLAVE,Shivering off like darts
703,AKRA THE SLAVE,From some impenetrable shield.
704,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, as we waited,"
705,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Sometimes, fearfully,"
706,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I gazed up those stupendous, soaring walls"
707,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of that great, slumbering city, wondering"
708,AKRA THE SLAVE,"What doom behind the bastioned ramparts slept,"
709,AKRA THE SLAVE,"What destiny, beneath the brooding night,"
710,AKRA THE SLAVE,Awaited me beyond the brazen gates.
711,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, naught the blind, indifferent stars revealed,"
712,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Though towards the long night’s ending,"
713,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Half-dazed with gazing up that aching height,"
714,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A drowsiness fell over me,"
715,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And in a restless waking-trance I lay,"
716,AKRA THE SLAVE,Dreaming that Life and Death before me stood.
717,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, as each thrust towards me a shrouded cup,"
718,AKRA THE SLAVE,Implacable silence bade me choose and drink.
719,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, as I stretched a blind, uncertain hand"
720,AKRA THE SLAVE,"To take the cup of death,"
721,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I wakened, and dawn trembled,"
722,AKRA THE SLAVE,"At last, beyond the Eastern hills,"
723,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, star by star, night failed;"
724,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And eagerly the sun leapt up the sky,"
725,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, as his flashing rays"
726,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Smote kindling towers and flaming gates of brass,"
727,AKRA THE SLAVE,Across the reedy moat
728,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A clattering drawbridge fell,"
729,AKRA THE SLAVE,And wide the glittering portals slowly swung:
730,AKRA THE SLAVE,And there came streaming out in slow procession
731,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A sleepy caravan of slouching camels,"
732,AKRA THE SLAVE,Groaning and grumbling as they strode along
733,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Beneath their mountainous burdens,"
734,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Upon whose swaying summits,"
735,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Impassively, the blue-robed merchants sat."
736,AKRA THE SLAVE,"They passed us slowly by,"
737,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And then we took the bridge,"
738,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, while our captors parleyed with the guards,"
739,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Who stood, on either hand,"
740,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With naked swords,"
741,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I turned my head,"
742,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And saw for the last time, far Eastward,"
743,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The cold, snow-brilliant peaks,"
744,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Beyond my dim, blue, native hills."
745,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, as I looked, my thoughts flew homeward,"
746,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And I, one dreaming moment,"
747,AKRA THE SLAVE,Stood by my mourning mother in the cavern
748,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of desolation, looking on the dead."
749,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And then, between the brazen gate-posts,"
750,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And underneath the brazen lintel,"
751,AKRA THE SLAVE,At last we entered Babylon.
752,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Before us, yet another wall arose,"
753,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, turning sharply"
754,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Down a narrow way,"
755,AKRA THE SLAVE,The living breath of heaven seemed shut from us
756,AKRA THE SLAVE,As though beneath the beetling crags
757,AKRA THE SLAVE,Of some deep mountain-gorge--
758,AKRA THE SLAVE,"By cliffs of wall, on either hand,"
759,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That soared up to the narrow sky,"
760,AKRA THE SLAVE,Which with dim lustre lit
761,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The shimmering surface of enamelled brick,"
762,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Whereon, through giant groves,"
763,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Blue-coated hunters chased the boar,"
764,AKRA THE SLAVE,Or ’loosed red-tasselled falcon
765,AKRA THE SLAVE,After flying crane.
766,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But soon we reached another gate,"
767,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Sword-guarded, and we entered,"
768,AKRA THE SLAVE,And plunged into the traffic
769,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of clamorous merchantmen,"
770,AKRA THE SLAVE,Speeding their business ere the heat of day.
771,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And as we jostled, slowly,"
772,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Through bewildering bazaars,"
773,AKRA THE SLAVE,The porters and the idler wayfarers
774,AKRA THE SLAVE,"All turned to look upon our shame,"
775,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With cold, unpitying eyes,"
776,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And indolent, gaping mouths,"
777,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or jested with our captors,"
778,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Until we left the busier thoroughfares,"
779,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And walked through groves of cypress and of ilex,"
780,AKRA THE SLAVE,Where not a sound or rumour troubled
781,AKRA THE SLAVE,The silence of the dark-plumed boughs
782,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And glimmering deeps of peace,"
783,AKRA THE SLAVE,Save only the cool spurt of waters
784,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That, from a myriad unseen jets,"
785,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Fretted the crystal airs of morning,"
786,AKRA THE SLAVE,And fell in frolic showers
787,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of twinkling, rainbow drops,"
788,AKRA THE SLAVE,That plashed in unseen basins;
789,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And through the blaze of almond-orchards,"
790,AKRA THE SLAVE,Tremulous with blossom
791,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That flickered in a rosy, silken snow"
792,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of falling petals over us,"
793,AKRA THE SLAVE,And wreathed about our feet
794,AKRA THE SLAVE,In soft and scented drifts;
795,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Beneath pomegranate trees in young, green leaf,"
796,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And through vast gardens, glowing with strange flowers,"
797,AKRA THE SLAVE,Such as no April kindled into bloom
798,AKRA THE SLAVE,Among the valleys of my native hills.
799,AKRA THE SLAVE,"We came unto a court of many fountains,"
800,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Where, leaping off their jaded mules,"
801,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Our captors loosed the thongs that held us,"
802,AKRA THE SLAVE,But left our wrists still bound.
803,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And one with great clay pitchers came,"
804,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And over our hot bodies, travel-stained,"
805,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Poured out cool, cleansing waters"
806,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In a gurgling, crystal stream,"
807,AKRA THE SLAVE,And flung coarse robes of indigo
808,AKRA THE SLAVE,About our naked shoulders.
809,AKRA THE SLAVE,And here we left behind us
810,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The maidens and the younger boys,"
811,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And passing through a gateway,"
812,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Came out upon a busy wharf,"
813,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Where, southward, midway through the city,"
814,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The broad Euphrates flows,"
815,AKRA THE SLAVE,"His dark flood thronged with merchant-dhows,"
816,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And fishing-boats of reed and bitumen,"
817,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Piled high with glistering barbel, freshly-caught;"
818,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And foreign craft, with many-coloured sails,"
819,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And laden deep with precious merchandise,"
820,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That, over wide, bewildering waters,"
821,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Across the perilous world,"
822,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The adventurous, dark-bearded mariners,"
823,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Who swear by unknown gods in alien tongues,"
824,AKRA THE SLAVE,Bring ever to the gates of Babylon.
825,AKRA THE SLAVE,"We crossed the drawbridge, round whose granite piers"
826,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Swirled strong, Spring-swollen waters,"
827,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Loud and tawny,"
828,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, through great brazen portals,"
829,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Passed within the palace gates,"
830,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When first I saw afar the hanging-gardens,"
831,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Arch on arch,"
832,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And tier on tier,"
833,AKRA THE SLAVE,Against a glowing sky.
834,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Two strapping Nubians, like young giants"
835,AKRA THE SLAVE,Hewn from blue-black marble
836,AKRA THE SLAVE,"By some immortal hand in immemorial ages,"
837,AKRA THE SLAVE,Led us slowly onward.
838,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The dappled pard-skins, slung across their shoulders,"
839,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Scarcely hid the ox-like thews,"
840,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Beneath the dark skin rippling,"
841,AKRA THE SLAVE,As they strode along before us.
842,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Through courts of alabaster,"
843,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And painted corridors,"
844,AKRA THE SLAVE,
845,AKRA THE SLAVE,And chambers fair with flowery tapestries
846,AKRA THE SLAVE,"They led us, wondering, till at last we came"
847,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Into a vast, dim hall of glimmering gold,"
848,AKRA THE SLAVE,The end of all our journeying.
849,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, as we halted on the threshold,"
850,AKRA THE SLAVE,"My eyes could see but little for a moment,"
851,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In the dusky, heavy air,"
852,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Through the ceaseless cloud of incense,"
853,AKRA THE SLAVE,Rising from the smouldering braziers
854,AKRA THE SLAVE,"To the gold, grey-clouded dome,"
855,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Tingling strangely in my nostrils,"
856,AKRA THE SLAVE,As I came from morning airs;
857,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Then slowly filling them with drowsy fume,"
858,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When, looking up with half-dazed eyes,"
859,AKRA THE SLAVE,I saw the King upon his golden throne:
860,AKRA THE SLAVE,And through my body
861,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Raged rebellious blood,"
862,AKRA THE SLAVE,In baffled riot beating
863,AKRA THE SLAVE,"At my corded wrists,"
864,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As if to burst the galling bonds,"
865,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That I might hurl that lean, swart face,"
866,AKRA THE SLAVE,"So idly turning towards us,"
867,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With thin curled lips,"
868,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And cold, incurious eyes,"
869,AKRA THE SLAVE,To headlong death--
870,AKRA THE SLAVE,Yea! even though I tumbled
871,AKRA THE SLAVE,The towers of Babylon round about my head.
872,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, when our captors bowed their foreheads low,"
873,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Obsequious to the throne,"
874,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I stood upright,"
875,AKRA THE SLAVE,And gazed my loathing on that listless form--
876,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The gay, embroidered robe,"
877,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The golden cap, that prankt the crispèd locks,"
878,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The short, square beard, new-oiled and barbered--"
879,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, in a flash,"
880,AKRA THE SLAVE,A heavy blow
881,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Fell on my head,"
882,AKRA THE SLAVE,And struck me to my knees
883,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Before the sleek, indifferent king."
884,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And then, on either hand,"
885,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With gripping palms upon my shoulders set,"
886,AKRA THE SLAVE,The Nubians towered above me
887,AKRA THE SLAVE,Like mighty men of stone.
888,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And savagely I struggled,"
889,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Half-stunned, to rise again;"
890,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When, as I vainly battled"
891,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In their unrelenting clutch,"
892,AKRA THE SLAVE,"My eyes lit for the first time on the Queen,"
893,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Who sat upon the daïs, by her lord"
894,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Half-shadowed, on a throne of ivory,"
895,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And all the hate died in me, as I saw"
896,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The face that hovered over me in dream,"
897,AKRA THE SLAVE,When I had slept beneath the low-boughed cedar:
898,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The moon-pale brows, o’er which the clustered hair"
899,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Hung like the smoke of torches, ruddy-gold,"
900,AKRA THE SLAVE,Against a canopy of peacock plumes:
901,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The deep brown, burning eyes,"
902,AKRA THE SLAVE,From which the soul looked on me in fierce pity.
903,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, as I gazed on that exultant beauty,"
904,AKRA THE SLAVE,The hunter and the slayer of men
905,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Was slain within me instantly,"
906,AKRA THE SLAVE,And I forgot the mountains and my home;
907,AKRA THE SLAVE,"My desolate mother, and my father’s death;"
908,AKRA THE SLAVE,My captive sisters ... and the thronèd King!
909,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I was as one, that moment,"
910,AKRA THE SLAVE,New-born into the world
911,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Full-limbed and thewed,"
912,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Yet, with the wondering heart"
913,AKRA THE SLAVE,Of earth-bewildered childhood.
914,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, unto me, it seemed"
915,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That, as the Queen looked down on me,"
916,AKRA THE SLAVE,There stole into her eyes
917,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Some dim remembrance of old dreams,"
918,AKRA THE SLAVE,That in their brown depths flickered
919,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With strange, elusive light,"
920,AKRA THE SLAVE,Like stars that tremble in still forest-pools.
921,AKRA THE SLAVE,One spake--
922,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I scarce knew whom, nor cared--"
923,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And bade me choose,"
924,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Before the throne,"
925,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Between a life of slavery,"
926,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or merciful, swift death--"
927,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Death, that but a moment since,"
928,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I would have dragged, exulting, on me--"
929,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And with my eyes still set on the Queen’s face,"
930,AKRA THE SLAVE,I answered:
931,AKRA THE SLAVE,"""I will serve"":"
932,AKRA THE SLAVE,And scarcely heeded that my wrists were loosed.
933,AKRA THE SLAVE,
934,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, huddled in a stifling hut,"
935,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That night, among my fellows,"
936,AKRA THE SLAVE,I could not sleep at all:
937,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But gazed, wild-eyed, till dawn upon that face,"
938,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Which hovered o’er me, like the moon of dreams;"
939,AKRA THE SLAVE,And seemed to draw the wandering tides of life
940,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In one vast wave, which ever strove"
941,AKRA THE SLAVE,"To climb the heavens wherein she moved,"
942,AKRA THE SLAVE,That it might break in triumphing foam about her.
943,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Not then, nor ever afterwards,"
944,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Was I a slave, among my fellow-slaves,"
945,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But one, who, with mean drudgery,"
946,AKRA THE SLAVE,And daily penance serves
947,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Before a holy altar,"
948,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That, sometimes, as he labours, his glad eyes"
949,AKRA THE SLAVE,May catch a gleam of the immortal light
950,AKRA THE SLAVE,Within the secret shrine;
951,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Yea! and, maybe, shall look, one day, with trembling,"
952,AKRA THE SLAVE,"On the bright-haired, imperishable god."
953,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, even when, day after day,"
954,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I bore the big reed-baskets, laden"
955,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With wet clay, digged beyond the Western moat,"
956,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Although I seemed to tread,"
957,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As treads the ox that turns the water-wheel,"
958,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A blindfold round of servitude,"
959,AKRA THE SLAVE,My quenchless vision ever burned before me:
960,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And when, in after days, I fed"
961,AKRA THE SLAVE,The roaring oven-furnaces;
962,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And toiled by them through sweltering days,"
963,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Though over me, at times, would come"
964,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Great longing for the hill-tops,"
965,AKRA THE SLAVE,And the noise of torrent-waters:
966,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or when, more skilled, I moulded"
967,AKRA THE SLAVE,The damp clay into bricks;
968,AKRA THE SLAVE,And spread the colour and the glaze;
969,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And in strength-giving heat of glowing kilns,"
970,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I baked them durable,"
971,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Clean-shaped, and meet for service:"
972,AKRA THE SLAVE,My vision flamed yet brighter;
973,AKRA THE SLAVE,And unto me it seemed
974,AKRA THE SLAVE,As if my gross and useless clay were burned
975,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In a white ecstasy of lustral fire,"
976,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That, in the fashioning of the house of love,"
977,AKRA THE SLAVE,I might serve perfectly the builder’s need.
978,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Thus, many months, I laboured;"
979,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Till, one day, at the noontide hour of rest,"
980,AKRA THE SLAVE,I lay; and with a sharpened reed--
981,AKRA THE SLAVE,As temple-scribes write down the holy lore
982,AKRA THE SLAVE,On tablets of wet clay--
983,AKRA THE SLAVE,"On the moist earth beside me,"
984,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I limned a young fawn, cropping"
985,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A bunch of tender, overhanging leaves."
986,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, as I slowly drew,"
987,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I dreamt a little sadly of the days,"
988,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When I, too, roamed, untethered,"
989,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And drinking in, unquestioning,"
990,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The sunshine and the air,"
991,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And all the rapture of the earth that turns,"
992,AKRA THE SLAVE,"New every morning to the wondering sun,"
993,AKRA THE SLAVE,Refashioned in still nights of starry dews:
994,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But one, the while, unseen of me,"
995,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Watched my unconscious hand, approving:"
996,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And I was set, next morning,"
997,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Among the craftsmen, who so deftly limned"
998,AKRA THE SLAVE,The hunts and battles for the palace walls.
999,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, happily, with them I lived"
1000,AKRA THE SLAVE,"A life of loving labour, for each line"
1001,AKRA THE SLAVE,Flowed from the knowledge of my heart:
1002,AKRA THE SLAVE,I drew the startled ostrich
1003,AKRA THE SLAVE,Fleeing from the far-flung noose:
1004,AKRA THE SLAVE,The brindled lynx; the onaga
1005,AKRA THE SLAVE,In dewy-plashing flight;
1006,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The bristling boar, at bay,"
1007,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Crouched in a deadly ring of threatening spears,"
1008,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With streaming nostrils, and red eyes ablaze;"
1009,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The striped hyæna; the gaunt, green-eyed wolf;"
1010,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The skulking jackal; the grey, brush-tailed fox;"
1011,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The hunting leopard and the antelope,"
1012,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In mid-chase tense,"
1013,AKRA THE SLAVE,With every thew astrain;
1014,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The dappled panther; the brown-eyed gazelle,"
1015,AKRA THE SLAVE,Butting with black horns through the tangled brake
1016,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The nimble hare, alert, with pricked-up ears;"
1017,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The tiger, crouched, with yellow eyes afire;"
1018,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The shaggy mountain-goat,"
1019,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Perched on the utmost crag,"
1020,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Against the afterglow of lucent ruby,"
1021,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or, poised with bunching hoofs"
1022,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In mid-spring over a dark, yawning chasm;"
1023,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or the black stallion, with his tameless troop,"
1024,AKRA THE SLAVE,Fording a mountain-river in the dawn.
1025,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, sometimes, as we toiled,"
1026,AKRA THE SLAVE,A terrible fleeting rapture
1027,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Would come upon me, when the Queen"
1028,AKRA THE SLAVE,Passed by us with her maidens;
1029,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or paused, a moment, gazing,"
1030,AKRA THE SLAVE,With tranced and kindling eyes upon our labours:
1031,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But never did I dare, at any time,"
1032,AKRA THE SLAVE,"To lift my eyes to hers,"
1033,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And look, as soul on soul,"
1034,AKRA THE SLAVE,As on the day her beauty brought to birth
1035,AKRA THE SLAVE,The strange new life within me.
1036,AKRA THE SLAVE,In silence she would ever leave us;
1037,AKRA THE SLAVE,And ever with her passing perished
1038,AKRA THE SLAVE,The light and colour of my work;
1039,AKRA THE SLAVE,"So that my heart failed, daunted by that glimpse"
1040,AKRA THE SLAVE,Of the ever-living beauty.
1041,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, sometimes, I would carve in ruddy teak,"
1042,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or ivory, from the Indian merchants bought,"
1043,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or in the rare, black basalt, little beasts"
1044,AKRA THE SLAVE,To please the idle fancies of the King;
1045,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or model in wet clay, and cast in bronze,"
1046,AKRA THE SLAVE,Great bulls and lions for the palace-courts;
1047,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or carve him seals of lapis-lazuli,"
1048,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of jasper, amethyst and serpentine,"
1049,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Chalcedony--carnelian, chrysoprase,"
1050,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Agate, sardonyx, and chalcedonyx--"
1051,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Green jade, and alabaster;"
1052,AKRA THE SLAVE,Or cut in stones that flashed and flickered
1053,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Like a glancing kingfisher,"
1054,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Or, in the sun-filled amber,"
1055,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The kite with broad wings spread,"
1056,AKRA THE SLAVE,Or little fluttering doves that pecked
1057,AKRA THE SLAVE,A golden bunch of dates:
1058,AKRA THE SLAVE,And then of these in settings of fine gold
1059,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Made fillets, rings and ear-rings."
1060,AKRA THE SLAVE,
1061,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Thus, one day,"
1062,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Dreaming, as ever, of the Queen,"
1063,AKRA THE SLAVE,I wrought a golden serpent for her hair:
1064,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And when I brought it to the King, next morn,"
1065,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Where he sat brooding over chess,"
1066,AKRA THE SLAVE,"He bade me bear it to the Queen, myself,"
1067,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And so, I went unto her, where she sat,"
1068,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Among her singing maidens, at the loom,"
1069,AKRA THE SLAVE,Weaving a silken web of Tyrian dye.
1070,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I laid the trinket at her feet, in silence:"
1071,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And she arose, and set it in her hair,"
1072,AKRA THE SLAVE,Whose living lustre far outshone
1073,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The cold, dead metal I had fashioned,"
1074,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As she stood before me, dreaming,"
1075,AKRA THE SLAVE,In her robe of flowing blue;
1076,AKRA THE SLAVE,Then looked a moment on me with kind eyes.
1077,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And though she spoke no word,"
1078,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I turned, and fled, in trembling,"
1079,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Before the light that shivered through me,"
1080,AKRA THE SLAVE,And struck my soul with shuddering ecstasy:
1081,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, still, through many days,"
1082,AKRA THE SLAVE,Although I did not look again
1083,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Upon those dreaming eyes,"
1084,AKRA THE SLAVE,Their visionary light
1085,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Within my soul, revealed eternity."
1086,AKRA THE SLAVE,
1087,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Thus, have the mortal years"
1088,AKRA THE SLAVE,Flowed onward to the perfect end--
1089,AKRA THE SLAVE,"This day of days,"
1090,AKRA THE SLAVE,"That never night shall quench,"
1091,AKRA THE SLAVE,Nor darkness vanquish:
1092,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, at dawn,"
1093,AKRA THE SLAVE,I die.
1094,AKRA THE SLAVE,
1095,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And yet, this morning, as I slowly climbed"
1096,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The steep, ascending stages"
1097,AKRA THE SLAVE,That lead up to the hanging-gardens--
1098,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Where, tier on tier,"
1099,AKRA THE SLAVE,The great brick arches bore
1100,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Their April wealth of blossoms,"
1101,AKRA THE SLAVE,Plumed with palm and dusky cypress--
1102,AKRA THE SLAVE,I little knew that I
1103,AKRA THE SLAVE,Who came to carve a garland
1104,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Round a fountain’s porphry basin,"
1105,AKRA THE SLAVE,Should scale so soon the utmost peak of life.
1106,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Throughout the morn I toiled,"
1107,AKRA THE SLAVE,Until an hour ere noon--
1108,AKRA THE SLAVE,"For no one, save the King and Queen,"
1109,AKRA THE SLAVE,"May walk in those high gardens, after midday--"
1110,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When, underneath a cypress shade,"
1111,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I paused, a moment, resting;"
1112,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And looking down upon the basking city,"
1113,AKRA THE SLAVE,Beneath me slumbering deeply--
1114,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Garden on garden glowing, grove on grove,"
1115,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Like some green fabric, shot with myriad hues,"
1116,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And chequered with white clusters of flat roofs,"
1117,AKRA THE SLAVE,Aquiver in clear heat:
1118,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And then I gazed up through the aching azure,"
1119,AKRA THE SLAVE,At the restless kites that hover
1120,AKRA THE SLAVE,Ever over Babylon:
1121,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, as I watched one broad-winged bird that hung"
1122,AKRA THE SLAVE,Above the seven-coloured pyramid
1123,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of Bel’s great temple,"
1124,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With wide pinions spread,"
1125,AKRA THE SLAVE,As though it kept eternal vigil over
1126,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The golden image in the golden shrine,"
1127,AKRA THE SLAVE,I thought of eagles poised
1128,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Above the peaks of glittering snows,"
1129,AKRA THE SLAVE,Beyond the Eastern plains.
1130,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Half-dreaming, thus, I lay,"
1131,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Lulled by the tinkling waters,"
1132,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Till, unawares, sleep slowly overcame me;"
1133,AKRA THE SLAVE,And noonday drifted by:
1134,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And still, I slept, unheeding:"
1135,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, in my sleep,"
1136,AKRA THE SLAVE,I looked on Beauty in a quiet place
1137,AKRA THE SLAVE,Of forest gloom and immemorial dream:
1138,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When, something rousing me from slumber,"
1139,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With waking eyes that yet seemed dream-enchanted,"
1140,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I looked upon the Queen,"
1141,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Where, in a secret close,"
1142,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Set thickly round with screens of yew and ilex,"
1143,AKRA THE SLAVE,"She stood upon the dark, broad brim"
1144,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Of a wide granite basin, gazing down,"
1145,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With dreaming eyes, into the glooming cool,"
1146,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Unraimented, save of the flickering gleam,"
1147,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Reflected from the lucent waters,"
1148,AKRA THE SLAVE,That flowed before her silently:
1149,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And slowly, from her feet,"
1150,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The cold light rippled up her body, till,"
1151,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Entangled in the meshes of her hair,"
1152,AKRA THE SLAVE,It flooded the calm rapture of her face:
1153,AKRA THE SLAVE,"When, dreaming still, she lifted up her eyes,"
1154,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Unseeing; and I looked upon her soul,"
1155,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Unveiled, in naked immortality,"
1156,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Untrammelled by the trappings of brief time,"
1157,AKRA THE SLAVE,And cloaks of circumstance.
1158,AKRA THE SLAVE,"How long I looked upon the perfect beauty,"
1159,AKRA THE SLAVE,I cannot tell--
1160,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Each moment, flowing to eternity,"
1161,AKRA THE SLAVE,Bearing me further from time’s narrow shores;
1162,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Though, yet, a little while,"
1163,AKRA THE SLAVE,From those unshadowed deeps time sought to hold me.
1164,AKRA THE SLAVE,
1165,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Suddenly, I felt"
1166,AKRA THE SLAVE,A ghostly arrow pierce my life;
1167,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And I leapt up, and turning,"
1168,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I saw the King beside me,"
1169,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With steely, glittering eyes"
1170,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Shooting barbed anger,"
1171,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Though he coldly spake,"
1172,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With evil, curling lips:"
1173,AKRA THE SLAVE,"""Slave, thou art dead!"""
1174,AKRA THE SLAVE,And yet I did not quail:
1175,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But, looking ’twixt his brows,"
1176,AKRA THE SLAVE,I answered: and he blenched before my words:
1177,AKRA THE SLAVE,"""Nay!  I have seen:"
1178,AKRA THE SLAVE,"""And am newborn, a King!"""
1179,AKRA THE SLAVE,And then his craven fingers
1180,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Went quaking to his wagging beard,"
1181,AKRA THE SLAVE,As if he felt my clutch upon his throat:
1182,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Yet, though, with one quick blow,"
1183,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I might have hurled him down to death,"
1184,AKRA THE SLAVE,I never stirred:
1185,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And, eyeing me, he summoned"
1186,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The negro-eunuchs, who kept watch below:"
1187,AKRA THE SLAVE,"But I, ere they could spring up the first stage,"
1188,AKRA THE SLAVE,Went forth to meet them;
1189,AKRA THE SLAVE,And they bound my wrists.
1190,AKRA THE SLAVE,
1191,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And so, down from the hills, my life has flowed,"
1192,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Until, at fullest flood, it meets the sea."
1193,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With calm and unregretful heart, I wait"
1194,AKRA THE SLAVE,Till dawn shall loose the arrow from the bow.
1195,AKRA THE SLAVE,"I, who, with eager, faltering hand have sought"
1196,AKRA THE SLAVE,"To fashion a little beauty, in the end,"
1197,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Have looked on the perfect beauty, and I die--"
1198,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Even as the priest, who, in the heart of night,"
1199,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Trembling before the thunder-riven shrine,"
1200,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Looks on the face of God, and perishes."
1201,AKRA THE SLAVE,I die...
1202,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And yet, maybe, when earth lies heavily"
1203,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Upon the time-o’ertoppled towers,"
1204,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And tumbled walls, and broken gates of brass;"
1205,AKRA THE SLAVE,And the winds whisper one another:
1206,AKRA THE SLAVE,"""Where, Oh! where is Babylon?"""
1207,AKRA THE SLAVE,"In the dim underworld of dreaming shades,"
1208,AKRA THE SLAVE,My soul shall seek out beauty
1209,AKRA THE SLAVE,"And look, once more,"
1210,AKRA THE SLAVE,Upon the unveiled vision...
1211,AKRA THE SLAVE,And not die.
1212,AKRA THE SLAVE,
1213,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Night passes: and already in the court,"
1214,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Amid the plash of fountains,"
1215,AKRA THE SLAVE,There sounds the pad of naked feet approaching.
1216,AKRA THE SLAVE,"With slow, deliberate pace,"
1217,AKRA THE SLAVE,"As though they trod out all my perished years,"
1218,AKRA THE SLAVE,"The Nubians come, to lead me out to death."
1219,AKRA THE SLAVE,Slowly the great door opens;
1220,AKRA THE SLAVE,And clearer comes the call of waters;
1221,AKRA THE SLAVE,Cool airs are on my brow ...
1222,AKRA THE SLAVE,"Lo! ... in the East, the dawn."
1223,AKRA THE SLAVE,
