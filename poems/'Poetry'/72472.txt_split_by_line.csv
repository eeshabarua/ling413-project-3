75,GERONTION,
76,GERONTION,_Thou hast nor youth nor age
77,GERONTION,"But as it were, an after dinner sleep"
78,GERONTION,Dreaming of both._
79,GERONTION,
80,GERONTION,"Here I am, an old man in a dry month"
81,GERONTION,"Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain."
82,GERONTION,I was neither at the hot gates
83,GERONTION,Nor fought in the warm rain
84,GERONTION,"Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass,"
85,GERONTION,"Bitten by flies, fought."
86,GERONTION,My house is a decayed house
87,GERONTION,"And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner,"
88,GERONTION,"Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp,"
89,GERONTION,"Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London."
90,GERONTION,The goat coughs at night in the field overhead;
91,GERONTION,"Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds."
92,GERONTION,"The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea,"
93,GERONTION,"Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter."
94,GERONTION,
95,GERONTION,"I an old man,"
96,GERONTION,A dull head among windy spaces.
97,GERONTION,
98,GERONTION,Signs are taken for wonders. “We would see a sign.”
99,GERONTION,"The word within a word, unable to speak a word,"
100,GERONTION,Swaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the year
101,GERONTION,Came Christ the tiger
102,GERONTION,"In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering judas,"
103,GERONTION,"To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk"
104,GERONTION,Among whispers; by Mr. Silvero
105,GERONTION,"With caressing hands, at Limoges"
106,GERONTION,
107,GERONTION,Who walked all night in the next room;
108,GERONTION,"By Hakagama, bowing among the Titians;"
109,GERONTION,"By Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room"
110,GERONTION,Shifting the candles; Fraülein von Kulp
111,GERONTION,"Who turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles"
112,GERONTION,"Weave the wind. I have no ghosts,"
113,GERONTION,An old man in a draughty house
114,GERONTION,Under a windy knob.
115,GERONTION,
116,GERONTION,"After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now"
117,GERONTION,"History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors"
118,GERONTION,"And issues; deceives with whispering ambitions,"
119,GERONTION,Guides us by vanities. Think now
120,GERONTION,"She gives when our attention is distracted,"
121,GERONTION,"And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions"
122,GERONTION,That the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late
123,GERONTION,"What’s not believed in, or if still believed,"
124,GERONTION,"In memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon"
125,GERONTION,Into weak hands what’s thought can be dispensed with
126,GERONTION,Till the refusal propagates a fear. Think
127,GERONTION,Neither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices
128,GERONTION,Are fathered by our heroism. Virtues
129,GERONTION,Are forced upon us by our impudent crimes.
130,GERONTION,
131,GERONTION,These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.
132,GERONTION,
133,GERONTION,The tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last
134,GERONTION,"We have not reached conclusion, when I"
135,GERONTION,Stiffen in a rented house. Think at last
136,GERONTION,I have not made this show purposelessly
137,GERONTION,And it is not by any concitation
138,GERONTION,Of the backward devils.
139,GERONTION,I would meet you upon this honestly.
140,GERONTION,I that was near your heart was removed therefrom
141,GERONTION,"To lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition."
142,GERONTION,I have lost my passion: why should I want to keep it
143,GERONTION,Since what is kept must be adulterated?
144,GERONTION,"I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:"
145,GERONTION,How should I use it for your closer contact?
146,GERONTION,
147,GERONTION,These with a thousand small deliberations
148,GERONTION,"Protract the profit of their chilled delirium,"
149,GERONTION,"Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,"
150,GERONTION,"With pungent sauces, multiply variety"
151,GERONTION,"In a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do,"
152,GERONTION,"Suspend its operations, will the weevil"
153,GERONTION,"Delay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs Cammell, whirled"
154,GERONTION,Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear
155,GERONTION,"In fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits"
156,GERONTION,"Of Belle Isle, or running by the Horn,"
157,GERONTION,"White feathers in the snow, the gulf claims"
158,GERONTION,"And an old man, driven on the Trades"
159,GERONTION,To a sleepy corner.
160,GERONTION,"Tenants of the house,"
161,GERONTION,Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.

786,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”"
787,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"Time to turn back and descend the stair,"
788,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,With a bald spot in the middle of my hair—
789,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,(They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”)
790,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,"
791,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin—"
792,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,(They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”)
793,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,Do I dare
794,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,Disturb the universe?
795,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,In a minute there is time
796,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.
797,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,
798,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"For I have known them all already, known them all:"
799,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,"
800,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
801,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,I know the voices dying with a dying fall
802,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,Beneath the music from a farther room.
803,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,So how should I presume?
804,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,
805,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"And I have known the eyes already, known them all—"
806,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,"
807,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,"
808,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,"
809,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,Then how should I begin
810,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,To spit out all the butt-ends of my ways and days?
811,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,And how should I presume?
812,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,
813,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"And I have known the arms already, known them all—"
814,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
815,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)"
816,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,Is it perfume from a dress
817,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,That makes me so digress?
818,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl."
819,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,And should I then presume?
820,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,And how should I begin?

824,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets"
825,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
826,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"Of lonely men in shirtsleeves, leaning out of windows?..."
827,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,
828,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,I should have been a pair of ragged claws

836,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me."
837,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,"
838,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
839,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,"
840,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought
841,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"in upon a platter,"
842,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,I am no prophet—and here’s no great matter;
843,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,"
844,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,"
845,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"And in short, I was afraid."
846,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,
847,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"And would it have been worth it, after all,"
848,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,"
849,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,"
850,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"Would it have been worth while,"
851,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"To have bitten off the matter with a smile,"
852,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,To have squeezed the universe into a ball
853,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"To roll it toward some overwhelming question,"
854,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead,"

861,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"Would it have been worth while,"
862,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,"
863,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail"
864,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,along the floor—
865,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"And this, and so much more?—"
866,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,It is impossible to say just what I mean!
867,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:

880,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,"Deferential, glad to be of use,"

894,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,
895,THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK,I have seen them riding seaward on the waves

913,THE JEW OF MALTA,
914,I,I
915,I,
916,I,Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
917,I,You have the scene arrange itself—as it will seem to do—
918,I,With “I have saved this afternoon for you”;
919,I,"And four wax candles in the darkened room,"
920,I,"Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,"
921,I,An atmosphere of Juliet’s tomb
922,I,"Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid."
923,I,"We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole"
924,I,"Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips."
925,I,"“So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul"
926,I,Should be resurrected only among friends
927,I,"Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom"
928,I,That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.”
929,I,—And so the conversation slips
930,I,Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
931,I,Through attenuated tones of violins
932,I,Mingled with remote cornets
933,I,And begins.
934,I,
935,I,"“You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,"
936,I,"And how, how rare and strange it is, to find"
937,I,"In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,"
938,I,(For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!
939,I,How keen you are!)
940,I,"To find a friend who has these qualities,"
941,I,"Who has, and gives"
942,I,Those qualities upon which friendship lives.
943,I,How much it means that I say this to you—
944,I,"Without these friendships—life, what _cauchemar_!”"
945,I,Among the windings of the violins
946,I,And the ariettes
947,I,Of cracked cornets
948,I,Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins
949,I,"Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,"
950,I,Capricious monotone
951,I,That is at least one definite “false note”.
952,I,"—Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,"
953,I,Admire the monuments
954,I,"Discuss the late events,"
955,I,Correct our watches by the public clocks.
956,I,Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.
957,I,
958,II,II
959,II,
960,II,Now that lilacs are in bloom
961,II,She has a bowl of lilacs in her room
962,II,And twists them in her fingers while she talks.
963,II,"“Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know"
964,II,"What life is, you who hold it in your hands;”"
965,II,(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks)
966,II,"“You let it flow from you, you let it flow"
967,II,"And youth is cruel, and has no remorse"
968,II,And smiles at situations which it cannot see.”
969,II,"I smile, of course,"
970,II,And go on drinking tea.
971,II,
972,II,"“Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall"
973,II,"My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,"
974,II,"I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world"
975,II,"To be wonderful and youthful, after all.”"
976,II,
977,II,The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune
978,II,Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:
979,II,“I am always sure that you understand
980,II,"My feelings, always sure that you feel,"
981,II,Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.
982,II,
983,II,"You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles’ heel."
984,II,"You will go on, and when you have prevailed"
985,II,You can say: at this point many a one has failed.
986,II,
987,II,"But what have I, but what have I, my friend,"
988,II,"To give you, what can you receive from me?"
989,II,Only the friendship and the sympathy
990,II,Of one about to reach her journey’s end.
991,II,
992,II,"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends....”"
993,II,
994,II,I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends
995,II,For what she has said to me?
996,II,
997,II,You will see me any morning in the park
998,II,Reading the comics and the sporting page.
999,II,Particularly I remark
1000,II,An English countess goes upon the stage.
1001,II,"A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,"
1002,II,Another bank defaulter has confessed.
1003,II,"I keep my countenance,"
1004,II,I remain self-possessed
1005,II,"Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired"
1006,II,Reiterates some worn-out common song
1007,II,With the smell of hyacinths across the garden
1008,II,Recalling things that other people have desired.
1009,II,Are these ideas right or wrong?
1010,II,
1011,III,III
1012,III,
1013,III,The October night comes down; returning as before
1014,III,Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease
1015,III,I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door
1016,III,And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.
1017,III,
1018,III,“And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?
1019,III,But that’s a useless question.
1020,III,"You hardly know when you are coming back,"
1021,III,You will find so much to learn.”
1022,III,My smile falls heavily among the bric-à-brac.
1023,III,
1024,III,“Perhaps you can write to me.”
1025,III,My self-possession flares up for a second;
1026,III,_This_ is as I had reckoned.
1027,III,“I have been wondering frequently of late
1028,III,(But our beginnings never know our ends!)
1029,III,Why we have not developed into friends.”
1030,III,
1031,III,"I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark"
1032,III,"Suddenly, his expression in a glass."
1033,III,My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.
1034,III,
1035,III,"“For everybody said so, all our friends,"
1036,III,They all were sure our feelings would relate
1037,III,So closely! I myself can hardly understand.
1038,III,We must leave it now to fate.
1039,III,"You will write, at any rate."
1040,III,Perhaps it is not too late.
1041,III,
1042,III,"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.”"
1043,III,
1044,III,And I must borrow every changing shape
1045,III,"To find expression ... dance, dance"
1046,III,"Like a dancing bear,"
1047,III,"Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape."
1048,III,"Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance—"
1049,III,
1050,III,"Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,"
1051,III,"Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;"
1052,III,Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand
1053,III,With the smoke coming down above the house-tops;
1054,III,"Doubtful, for quite a while"
1055,III,Not knowing what to feel or if I understand
1056,III,"Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ..."
1057,III,"Would she not have the advantage, after all?"
1058,III,This music is successful with a “dying fall”
1059,III,Now that we talk of dying—
1060,III,And should I have the right to smile?
1061,III,

1070,I,The winter evening settles down
1071,I,With smell of steaks in passageways.
1072,I,Six o’clock.
1073,I,The burn-out ends of smoky days.
1074,I,And now a gusty shower wraps
1075,I,The grimy scraps
1076,I,Of withered leaves about your feet
1077,I,And newspapers from vacant lots;
1078,I,The showers beat
1079,I,"On broken blinds and chimney-pots,"
1080,I,And at the corner of the street
1081,I,A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.
1082,I,And then the lighting of the lamps.
1083,I,
1084,II,II
1085,II,
1086,II,The morning comes to consciousness
1087,II,Of faint stale smells of beer
1088,II,From the sawdust-trampled street
1089,II,With all its muddy feet that press
1090,II,To early coffee-stands.
1091,II,
1092,II,With the other masquerades
1093,II,"That time resumes,"
1094,II,
1095,II,One thinks of all the hands
1096,II,That are raising dingy shades
1097,II,In a thousand furnished rooms.
1098,II,
1099,III,III
1100,III,
1101,III,"You tossed a blanket from the bed,"
1102,III,"You lay upon your back, and waited;"
1103,III,"You dozed, and watched the night revealing"
1104,III,The thousand sordid images
1105,III,Of which your soul was constituted;
1106,III,They flickered against the ceiling.
1107,III,And when all the world came back
1108,III,"And the light crept up between the shutters,"
1109,III,"And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,"
1110,III,You had such a vision of the street
1111,III,As the street hardly understands;
1112,III,"Sitting along the bed’s edge, where"
1113,III,"You curled the papers from your hair,"
1114,III,Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
1115,III,In the palms of both soiled hands.
1116,III,
1117,IV,IV
1118,IV,
1119,IV,His soul stretched tight across the skies
1120,IV,"That fade behind a city block,"
1121,IV,Or trampled by insistent feet
1122,IV,At four and five and six o’clock;
1123,IV,"And short square fingers stuffing pipes,"
1124,IV,"And evening newspapers, and eyes"
1125,IV,"Assured of certain certainties,"
1126,IV,The conscience of a blackened street
1127,IV,Impatient to assume the world.
1128,IV,
1129,IV,I am moved by fancies that are curled
1130,IV,"Around these images, and cling:"
1131,IV,The notion of some infinitely gentle
1132,IV,Infinitely suffering thing.
1133,IV,
1134,IV,"Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;"
1135,IV,The worlds revolve like ancient women
1136,IV,Gathering fuel in vacant lots.

1185,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,I could see nothing behind that child’s eye.
1186,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,I have seen eyes in the street
1187,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"Trying to peer through lighted shutters,"
1188,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"And a crab one afternoon in a pool,"
1189,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"An old crab with barnacles on his back,"
1190,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.
1191,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,
1192,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"Half-past three,"
1193,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"The lamp sputtered,"
1194,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,The lamp muttered in the dark.
1195,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,The lamp hummed:
1196,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"“Regard the moon,"
1197,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"La lune ne garde aucune rancune,"
1198,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"She winks a feeble eye,"
1199,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,She smiles into corners.
1200,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,She smoothes the hair of the grass.
1201,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,The moon has lost her memory.
1202,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,"
1203,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"Her hand twists a paper rose,"
1204,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"That smells of dust and old Cologne,"
1205,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,She is alone
1206,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,With all the old nocturnal smells
1207,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,That cross and cross across her brain.
1208,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,The reminiscence comes
1209,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,Of sunless dry geraniums
1210,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"And dust in crevices,"
1211,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"Smells of chestnuts in the streets,"
1212,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"And female smells in shuttered rooms,"
1213,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,And cigarettes in corridors
1214,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,And cocktail smells in bars.”
1215,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,
1216,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,The lamp said
1217,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"“Four o’clock,"
1218,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,Here is the number on the door.
1219,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,Memory!
1220,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,You have thè key
1221,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,"
1222,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,Mount.
1223,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"The bed is open: the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,"
1224,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,"Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.”"
1225,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,
1226,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,The last twist of the knife.
1227,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,
1228,RHAPSODY ON A WINDY NIGHT,

1232,MORNING AT THE WINDOW,
1233,MORNING AT THE WINDOW,
1234,MORNING AT THE WINDOW,They are rattling breakfast plates in basement kitchens
1235,MORNING AT THE WINDOW,And along the trampled edges of the street
1236,MORNING AT THE WINDOW,I am aware of the damp souls of housemaids
1237,MORNING AT THE WINDOW,Sprouting despondently at area gates.
1238,MORNING AT THE WINDOW,
1239,MORNING AT THE WINDOW,The brown waves of fog toss up to me
1240,MORNING AT THE WINDOW,"Twisted faces from the bottom of the street,"
1241,MORNING AT THE WINDOW,And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts
1242,MORNING AT THE WINDOW,An aimless smile that hovers in the air
1243,MORNING AT THE WINDOW,And vanishes along the level of the roofs.

1252,CONVERSATION GALANTE,"Or possibly (fantastic, I confess)"
1253,CONVERSATION GALANTE,It may be Prester John’s balloon
1254,CONVERSATION GALANTE,Or an old battered lantern hung aloft
1255,CONVERSATION GALANTE,To light poor travellers to their distress.”
1256,CONVERSATION GALANTE,She then: “How you digress!”
1257,CONVERSATION GALANTE,
1258,CONVERSATION GALANTE,And I then: “Some one frames upon the keys
1259,CONVERSATION GALANTE,"That exquisite nocturne, with which we explain"
1260,CONVERSATION GALANTE,The night and moonshine; music which we seize
1261,CONVERSATION GALANTE,To body forth our own vacuity.”
1262,CONVERSATION GALANTE,She then: “Does this refer to me?”
1263,CONVERSATION GALANTE,"“Oh no, it is I who am inane.”"
1264,CONVERSATION GALANTE,
1265,CONVERSATION GALANTE,"“You, madam, are the eternal humorist,"
1266,CONVERSATION GALANTE,"The eternal enemy of the absolute,"
1267,CONVERSATION GALANTE,Giving our vagrant moods the slightest twist!
1268,CONVERSATION GALANTE,With your air indifferent and imperious
1269,CONVERSATION GALANTE,At a stroke our mad poetics to confute—”
1270,CONVERSATION GALANTE,And—“Are we then so serious?”

1280,AUNT HELEN,Cared for by servants to the number of four.
1281,AUNT HELEN,Now when she died there was silence in heaven
1282,AUNT HELEN,And silence at her end of the street.
1283,AUNT HELEN,The shutters were drawn and the undertaker wiped his feet—
1284,AUNT HELEN,He was aware that this sort of thing had occurred before.
1285,AUNT HELEN,"The dogs were handsomely provided for,"
1286,AUNT HELEN,But shortly afterwards the parrot died too.
1287,AUNT HELEN,"The Dresden clock continued ticking on the mantelpiece,"
1288,AUNT HELEN,And the footman sat upon the dining-table

1323,MR. APPOLINAX,His laughter tinkled among the teacups.

1327,MR. APPOLINAX,"In the palace of Mrs. Phlaccus, at Professor Channing-Cheetah’s"

1330,MR. APPOLINAX,Like the old man of the sea’s
1331,MR. APPOLINAX,Hidden under coral islands
1332,MR. APPOLINAX,"Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green silence,"
1333,MR. APPOLINAX,Dropping from fingers of surf.

1335,MR. APPOLINAX,Or grinning over a screen
1336,MR. APPOLINAX,With seaweed in its hair.
1337,MR. APPOLINAX,I heard the beat of centaurs’ hoofs over the hard turf
1338,MR. APPOLINAX,As his dry and passionate talk devoured the afternoon.
1339,MR. APPOLINAX,“He is a charming man”—“But after all what did he mean?”—
