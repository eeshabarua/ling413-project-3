2673,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"Their anchors down, by London town, the Three Great Captains lay;"
2674,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to Skye,"
2675,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands thereby,"
2676,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse to Blackwall,"
2677,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,And he was Captain of the Fleet -- the bravest of them all.
2678,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,Their good guns guarded their great gray sides
2679,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"that were thirty foot in the sheer,"
2680,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,When there came a certain trading-brig with news of a privateer.
2681,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"Her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a Northern breeze,"
2682,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,Her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the Eastern seas.
2683,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"Light she rode in the rude tide-rip, to left and right she rolled,"

2688,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,We tack not now to a Gallang prow or a plunging Pei-ho junk;
2689,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,I had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare
2690,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,Till I met with a lime-washed Yankee brig that rode off Finisterre.
2691,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"There were canvas blinds to his bow-gun ports to screen the weight he bore,"
2692,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,And the signals ran for a merchantman from Sandy Hook to the Nore.
2693,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"He would not fly the Rovers' flag -- the bloody or the black,"
2694,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,But now he floated the Gridiron and now he flaunted the Jack.
2695,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,He spoke of the Law as he crimped my crew -- he swore it was only a loan;
2696,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"But when I would ask for my own again, he swore it was none of my own."
2697,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"He has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the Line,"
2698,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,He has stripped my rails of the shaddock-frails and the green unripened pine;
2699,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"He has taken my bale of dammer and spice I won beyond the seas,"
2700,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,He has taken my grinning heathen gods -- and what should he want o' these?

2702,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"He has whittled the two, this Yank Yahoo, to peddle for shoe-peg oats."
2703,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"I could not fight for the failing light and a rough beam-sea beside,"
2704,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,But I hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied.
2705,THE RHYME OF THE THREE CAPTAINS,"Had I had guns (as I had goods) to work my Christian harm,"

2984,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Left it unlighted and forgot Taman,"
2985,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,When all the Valley followed after Kysh
2986,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And Yabosh, little Gods but very wise,"
2987,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And from the sky Taman beheld their sin.
2988,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
2989,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"He sent the Sickness out upon the hills,"
2990,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"The Red Horse Sickness with the iron hooves,"
2991,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,To turn the Valley to Taman again.
2992,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
2993,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And the Red Horse snuffed thrice into the wind,"
2994,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,The naked wind that had no fear of him;
2995,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And the Red Horse stamped thrice upon the snow,"
2996,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,The naked snow that had no fear of him;
2997,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And the Red Horse went out across the rocks,"
2998,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,The ringing rocks that had no fear of him;
2999,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And downward, where the lean birch meets the snow,"
3000,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And downward, where the gray pine meets the birch,"
3001,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And downward, where the dwarf oak meets the pine,"
3002,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Till at his feet our cup-like pastures lay.
3003,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3004,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"That night, the slow mists of the evening dropped,"
3005,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Dropped as a cloth upon a dead man's face,"
3006,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And weltered in the Valley, bluish-white"
3007,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Like water very silent -- spread abroad,"
3008,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Like water very silent, from the Shrine"
3009,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Unlighted of Taman to where the stream
3010,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Is dammed to fill our cattle-troughs -- sent up
3011,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"White waves that rocked and heaved and then were still,"
3012,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Till all the Valley glittered like a marsh,"
3013,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Beneath the moonlight, filled with sluggish mist"
3014,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Knee-deep, so that men waded as they walked."
3015,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3016,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"That night, the Red Horse grazed above the Dam,"
3017,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Beyond the cattle-troughs.  Men heard him feed,"
3018,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And those that heard him sickened where they lay.
3019,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3020,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Thus came the Sickness to Er-Heb, and slew"
3021,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Ten men, strong men, and of the women four;"
3022,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And the Red Horse went hillward with the dawn,"
3023,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,But near the cattle-troughs his hoof-prints lay.
3024,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3025,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"That night, the slow mists of the evening dropped,"
3026,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Dropped as a cloth upon the dead, but rose"
3027,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"A little higher, to a young girl's height;"
3028,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Till all the Valley glittered like a lake,"
3029,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Beneath the moonlight, filled with sluggish mist."
3030,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3031,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"That night, the Red Horse grazed beyond the Dam,"
3032,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"A stone's-throw from the troughs.  Men heard him feed,"
3033,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And those that heard him sickened where they lay.
3034,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Thus came the Sickness to Er-Heb, and slew"
3035,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Of men a score, and of the women eight,"
3036,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And of the children two.
3037,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3038,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Because the road
3039,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"To Gorukh was a road of enemies,"
3040,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And Ao-Safai was blocked with early snow,"
3041,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,We could not flee from out the Valley.  Death
3042,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Smote at us in a slaughter-pen, and Kysh"
3043,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Was mute as Yabosh, though the goats were slain;"
3044,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And the Red Horse grazed nightly by the stream,"
3045,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And later, outward, towards the Unlighted Shrine,"
3046,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And those that heard him sickened where they lay.
3047,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3048,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Then said Bisesa to the Priests at dusk,"
3049,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"When the white mist rose up breast-high, and choked"
3050,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,The voices in the houses of the dead: --
3051,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"""Yabosh and Kysh avail not.  If the Horse"
3052,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Reach the Unlighted Shrine we surely die.
3053,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Ye have forgotten of all Gods the Chief,"
3054,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Taman!""  Here rolled the thunder through the Hills"
3055,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And Yabosh shook upon his pedestal.
3056,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"""Ye have forgotten of all Gods the Chief"
3057,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Too long.""  And all were dumb save one, who cried"
3058,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"On Yabosh with the Sapphire 'twixt His knees,"
3059,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"But found no answer in the smoky roof,"
3060,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And, being smitten of the Sickness, died"
3061,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Before the altar of the Sapphire Shrine.
3062,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3063,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Then said Bisesa: -- ""I am near to Death,"
3064,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And have the Wisdom of the Grave for gift
3065,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,To bear me on the path my feet must tread.
3066,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"If there be wealth on earth, then I am rich,"
3067,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,For Armod is the first of all Er-Heb;
3068,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"If there be beauty on the earth,"" -- her eyes"
3069,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Dropped for a moment to the temple floor, --"
3070,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"""Ye know that I am fair.  If there be love,"
3071,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Ye know that love is mine.""  The Chief in War,"
3072,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"The Man of Sixty Spears, broke from the press,"
3073,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And would have clasped her, but the Priests withstood,"
3074,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Saying: -- ""She has a message from Taman."""
3075,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Then said Bisesa: -- ""By my wealth and love"
3076,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And beauty, I am chosen of the God"
3077,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Taman.""  Here rolled the thunder through the Hills"
3078,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And Kysh fell forward on the Mound of Skulls.
3079,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3080,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"In darkness, and before our Priests, the maid"
3081,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Between the altars cast her bracelets down,"
3082,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Therewith the heavy earrings Armod made,"
3083,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"When he was young, out of the water-gold"
3084,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Of Gorukh -- threw the breast-plate thick with jade
3085,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Upon the turquoise anklets -- put aside
3086,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,The bands of silver on her brow and neck;
3087,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And as the trinkets tinkled on the stones,"
3088,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,The thunder of Taman lowed like a bull.
3089,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3090,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Then said Bisesa, stretching out her hands,"
3091,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"As one in darkness fearing Devils: -- ""Help!"
3092,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"O Priests, I am a woman very weak,"
3093,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And who am I to know the will of Gods?
3094,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Taman hath called me -- whither shall I go?"""
3095,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"The Chief in War, the Man of Sixty Spears,"
3096,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Howled in his torment, fettered by the Priests,"
3097,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"But dared not come to her to drag her forth,"
3098,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And dared not lift his spear against the Priests.
3099,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Then all men wept.
3100,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3101,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,There was a Priest of Kysh
3102,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Bent with a hundred winters, hairless, blind,"
3103,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And taloned as the great Snow-Eagle is.
3104,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"His seat was nearest to the altar-fires,"
3105,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And he was counted dumb among the Priests.
3106,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"But, whether Kysh decreed, or from Taman"
3107,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,The impotent tongue found utterance we know
3108,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,As little as the bats beneath the eaves.
3109,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,He cried so that they heard who stood without: --
3110,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"""To the Unlighted Shrine!"" and crept aside"
3111,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Into the shadow of his fallen God
3112,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And whimpered, and Bisesa went her way."
3113,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3114,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"That night, the slow mists of the evening dropped,"
3115,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Dropped as a cloth upon the dead, and rose"
3116,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Above the roofs, and by the Unlighted Shrine"
3117,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Lay as the slimy water of the troughs
3118,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,When murrain thins the cattle of Er-Heb:
3119,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And through the mist men heard the Red Horse feed.
3120,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3121,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"In Armod's house they burned Bisesa's dower,"
3122,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And killed her black bull Tor, and broke her wheel,"
3123,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And loosed her hair, as for the marriage-feast,"
3124,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,With cries more loud than mourning for the dead.
3125,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3126,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Across the fields, from Armod's dwelling-place,"
3127,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,We heard Bisesa weeping where she passed
3128,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,To seek the Unlighted Shrine; the Red Horse neighed
3129,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And followed her, and on the river-mint"
3130,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,His hooves struck dead and heavy in our ears.
3131,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3132,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Out of the mists of evening, as the star"
3133,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Of Ao-Safai climbs through the black snow-blur
3134,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"To show the Pass is clear, Bisesa stepped"
3135,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Upon the great gray slope of mortised stone,"
3136,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,The Causeway of Taman.  The Red Horse neighed
3137,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Behind her to the Unlighted Shrine -- then fled
3138,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,North to the Mountain where his stable lies.
3139,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3140,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"They know who dared the anger of Taman,"
3141,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And watched that night above the clinging mists,"
3142,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Far up the hill, Bisesa's passing in."
3143,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3144,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"She set her hand upon the carven door,"
3145,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Fouled by a myriad bats, and black with time,"
3146,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Whereon is graved the Glory of Taman
3147,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,In letters older than the Ao-Safai;
3148,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And twice she turned aside and twice she wept,"
3149,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Cast down upon the threshold, clamouring"
3150,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"For him she loved -- the Man of Sixty Spears,"
3151,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And for her father, -- and the black bull Tor,"
3152,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Hers and her pride.  Yea, twice she turned away"
3153,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Before the awful darkness of the door,"
3154,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And the great horror of the Wall of Man
3155,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Where Man is made the plaything of Taman,"
3156,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,An Eyeless Face that waits above and laughs.
3157,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3158,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,But the third time she cried and put her palms
3159,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Against the hewn stone leaves, and prayed Taman"
3160,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,To spare Er-Heb and take her life for price.
3161,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3162,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"They know who watched, the doors were rent apart"
3163,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And closed upon Bisesa, and the rain"
3164,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Broke like a flood across the Valley, washed"
3165,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,The mist away; but louder than the rain
3166,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,The thunder of Taman filled men with fear.
3167,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3168,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Some say that from the Unlighted Shrine she cried
3169,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"For succour, very pitifully, thrice,"
3170,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And others that she sang and had no fear.
3171,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"And some that there was neither song nor cry,"
3172,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,But only thunder and the lashing rain.
3173,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3174,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Howbeit, in the morning men rose up,"
3175,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Perplexed with horror, crowding to the Shrine."
3176,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And when Er-Heb was gathered at the doors
3177,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,The Priests made lamentation and passed in
3178,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,To a strange Temple and a God they feared
3179,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,But knew not.
3180,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3181,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,From the crevices the grass
3182,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Had thrust the altar-slabs apart, the walls"
3183,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Were gray with stains unclean, the roof-beams swelled"
3184,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"With many-coloured growth of rottenness,"
3185,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,And lichen veiled the Image of Taman
3186,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,In leprosy.  The Basin of the Blood
3187,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Above the altar held the morning sun:
3188,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"A winking ruby on its heart:  below,"
3189,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Face hid in hands, the maid Bisesa lay."
3190,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,
3191,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Er-Heb beyond the Hills of Ao-Safai
3192,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,"Bears witness to the truth, and Ao-Safai"
3193,THE SACRIFICE OF ER-HEB,Hath told the men of Gorukh.  Thence the tale

3207,THE EXPLANATION,Mingled arrows strewed the ground.
3208,THE EXPLANATION,Hastily they gathered then

3210,THE EXPLANATION,"Ah, the fateful dawn deceived!"
3211,THE EXPLANATION,Mingled arrows each one sheaved;

3228,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,
3229,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"The dead child lay in the shroud,"
3230,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,And the widow watched beside;
3231,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"And her mother slept, and the Channel swept"
3232,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,The gale in the teeth of the tide.
3233,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,
3234,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,But the mother laughed at all.
3235,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"""I have lost my man in the sea,"

3239,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"The widow watched the dead,"
3240,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"And the candle guttered low,"
3241,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,And she tried to sing the Passing Song
3242,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,That bids the poor soul go.
3243,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,
3244,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"And ""Mary take you now,"" she sang,"

3247,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"But she could not say ""Depart."""

3249,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"Then came a cry from the sea,"
3250,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"But the sea-rime blinded the glass,"
3251,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"And ""Heard ye nothing, mother?"" she said,"
3252,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"""'Tis the child that waits to pass."""

3263,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,
3264,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"They laid a sheet to the door,"
3265,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"With the little quilt atop,"

3269,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,The widow lifted the latch

3284,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"""The terns are blown inland,"

3298,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,
3299,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"In the heel of the wind-bit pier,"
3300,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"Where the twisted weed was piled,"
3301,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"She came to the life she had missed by an hour,"
3302,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,For she came to a little child.
3303,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,
3304,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"She laid it into her breast,"
3305,THE GIFT OF THE SEA,"And back to her mother she came,"

3972,L'ENVOI,"And the ricks stand gray to the sun,"
3973,L'ENVOI,"Singing: -- ""Over then, come over, for the bee has quit the clover,"
3974,L'ENVOI,"And your English summer's done."""
3975,L'ENVOI,"You have heard the beat of the off-shore wind,"
3976,L'ENVOI,And the thresh of the deep-sea rain;
3977,L'ENVOI,You have heard the song -- how long! how long?
3978,L'ENVOI,Pull out on the trail again!
3979,L'ENVOI,
3980,L'ENVOI,"Ha' done with the Tents of Shem, dear lass,"
3981,L'ENVOI,"We've seen the seasons through,"
3982,L'ENVOI,"And it's time to turn on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
3983,L'ENVOI,"Pull out, pull out, on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new."
3984,L'ENVOI,
3985,L'ENVOI,"It's North you may run to the rime-ringed sun,"

3988,L'ENVOI,Or West to the Golden Gate;
3989,L'ENVOI,"Where the blindest bluffs hold good, dear lass,"
3990,L'ENVOI,"And the wildest tales are true,"
3991,L'ENVOI,"And the men bulk big on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
3992,L'ENVOI,And life runs large on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.
3993,L'ENVOI,
3994,L'ENVOI,"The days are sick and cold, and the skies are gray and old,"
3995,L'ENVOI,And the twice-breathed airs blow damp;
3996,L'ENVOI,And I'd sell my tired soul for the bucking beam-sea roll
3997,L'ENVOI,Of a black Bilbao tramp;
3998,L'ENVOI,"With her load-line over her hatch, dear lass,"
3999,L'ENVOI,"And a drunken Dago crew,"
4000,L'ENVOI,"And her nose held down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail"
4001,L'ENVOI,From Cadiz Bar on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.
4002,L'ENVOI,
4003,L'ENVOI,"There be triple ways to take, of the eagle or the snake,"
4004,L'ENVOI,Or the way of a man with a maid;
4005,L'ENVOI,But the fairest way to me is a ship's upon the sea
4006,L'ENVOI,In the heel of the North-East Trade.
4007,L'ENVOI,"Can you hear the crash on her bows, dear lass,"
4008,L'ENVOI,"And the drum of the racing screw,"
4009,L'ENVOI,"As she ships it green on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
4010,L'ENVOI,As she lifts and 'scends on the Long Trail --
4011,L'ENVOI,the trail that is always new?
4012,L'ENVOI,
4013,L'ENVOI,"See the shaking funnels roar, with the Peter at the fore,"
4014,L'ENVOI,"And the fenders grind and heave,"
4015,L'ENVOI,"And the derricks clack and grate, as the tackle hooks the crate,"
4016,L'ENVOI,And the fall-rope whines through the sheave;
4017,L'ENVOI,"It's ""Gang-plank up and in,"" dear lass,"
4018,L'ENVOI,"It's ""Hawsers warp her through!"""
4019,L'ENVOI,"And it's ""All clear aft"" on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
4020,L'ENVOI,We're backing down on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.
4021,L'ENVOI,
4022,L'ENVOI,"O the mutter overside, when the port-fog holds us tied,"
4023,L'ENVOI,And the sirens hoot their dread!
4024,L'ENVOI,When foot by foot we creep o'er the hueless viewless deep
4025,L'ENVOI,To the sob of the questing lead!
4026,L'ENVOI,"It's down by the Lower Hope, dear lass,"
4027,L'ENVOI,"With the Gunfleet Sands in view,"
4028,L'ENVOI,"Till the Mouse swings green on the old trail,"
4029,L'ENVOI,"our own trail, the out trail,"
4030,L'ENVOI,And the Gull Light lifts on the Long Trail --
4031,L'ENVOI,the trail that is always new.
4032,L'ENVOI,
4033,L'ENVOI,"O the blazing tropic night, when the wake's a welt of light"
4034,L'ENVOI,"That holds the hot sky tame,"
4035,L'ENVOI,And the steady fore-foot snores through the planet-powdered floors
4036,L'ENVOI,Where the scared whale flukes in flame!
4037,L'ENVOI,"Her plates are scarred by the sun, dear lass,"
4038,L'ENVOI,"And her ropes are taut with the dew,"
4039,L'ENVOI,"For we're booming down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
4040,L'ENVOI,We're sagging south on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.
4041,L'ENVOI,
4042,L'ENVOI,"Then home, get her home, where the drunken rollers comb,"
4043,L'ENVOI,"And the shouting seas drive by,"
4044,L'ENVOI,"And the engines stamp and ring, and the wet bows reel and swing,"
4045,L'ENVOI,And the Southern Cross rides high!
4046,L'ENVOI,"Yes, the old lost stars wheel back, dear lass,"
4047,L'ENVOI,That blaze in the velvet blue.
4048,L'ENVOI,"They're all old friends on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"
4049,L'ENVOI,They're God's own guides on the Long Trail --
4050,L'ENVOI,the trail that is always new.
4051,L'ENVOI,
4052,L'ENVOI,"Fly forward, O my heart, from the Foreland to the Start --"
4053,L'ENVOI,"We're steaming all-too slow,"
4054,L'ENVOI,And it's twenty thousand mile to our little lazy isle
4055,L'ENVOI,Where the trumpet-orchids blow!
4056,L'ENVOI,"You have heard the call of the off-shore wind,"
4057,L'ENVOI,And the voice of the deep-sea rain;
4058,L'ENVOI,You have heard the song -- how long! how long?
4059,L'ENVOI,Pull out on the trail again!
4060,L'ENVOI,
4061,L'ENVOI,"The Lord knows what we may find, dear lass,"
4062,L'ENVOI,And The Deuce knows what we may do --
4063,L'ENVOI,"But we're back once more on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,"

4251,I,"As the deer breaks -- as the steer breaks -- from the herd where they graze,"
4252,I,In the faith of little children we went on our ways.
4253,I,Then the wood failed -- then the food failed -- then the last water dried --
4254,I,In the faith of little children we lay down and died.
4255,I,"On the sand-drift -- on the veldt-side -- in the fern-scrub we lay,"
4256,I,That our sons might follow after by the bones on the way.
4257,I,"Follow after -- follow after!  We have watered the root,"
4258,I,And the bud has come to blossom that ripens for fruit!
4259,I,"Follow after -- we are waiting, by the trails that we lost,"

4326,II,"Words, and the words of men, flicker and flutter and beat --"

4328,II,For a Power troubles the Still that has neither voice nor feet.

4523,THE FIRST CHANTEY,Hot rose her tribe on our track ere I had proved her;
4524,THE FIRST CHANTEY,"Hearing her laugh in the gloom, greatly I loved her."
4525,THE FIRST CHANTEY,
4526,THE FIRST CHANTEY,"Swift through the forest we ran; none stood to guard us,"
4527,THE FIRST CHANTEY,Few were my people and far; then the flood barred us --
4528,THE FIRST CHANTEY,"Him we call Son of the Sea, sullen and swollen."
4529,THE FIRST CHANTEY,"Panting we waited the death, stealer and stolen."
4530,THE FIRST CHANTEY,
4531,THE FIRST CHANTEY,"Yet ere they came to my lance laid for the slaughter,"
4532,THE FIRST CHANTEY,Lightly she leaped to a log lapped in the water;
4533,THE FIRST CHANTEY,"Holding on high and apart skins that arrayed her,"
4534,THE FIRST CHANTEY,Called she the God of the Wind that He should aid her.
4535,THE FIRST CHANTEY,
4536,THE FIRST CHANTEY,Life had the tree at that word (Praise we the Giver!)
4537,THE FIRST CHANTEY,Otter-like left he the bank for the full river.
4538,THE FIRST CHANTEY,"Far fell their axes behind, flashing and ringing,"
4539,THE FIRST CHANTEY,Wonder was on me and fear -- yet she was singing!
4540,THE FIRST CHANTEY,
4541,THE FIRST CHANTEY,"Low lay the land we had left.  Now the blue bound us,"
4542,THE FIRST CHANTEY,Even the Floor of the Gods level around us.
4543,THE FIRST CHANTEY,"Whisper there was not, nor word, shadow nor showing,"
4544,THE FIRST CHANTEY,"Till the light stirred on the deep, glowing and growing."
4545,THE FIRST CHANTEY,
4546,THE FIRST CHANTEY,"Then did He leap to His place flaring from under,"

4550,THE FIRST CHANTEY,
4551,THE FIRST CHANTEY,This we beheld (and we live) -- the Pit of the Burning!

4584,THE LAST CHANTEY,To cool me on the floe?
4585,THE LAST CHANTEY,"And Ye take my day of mercy if Ye take away the sea!"""
4586,THE LAST CHANTEY,
4587,THE LAST CHANTEY,Then said the soul of the Angel of the Off-shore Wind:
4588,THE LAST CHANTEY,(He that bits the thunder when the bull-mouthed breakers flee):
4589,THE LAST CHANTEY,"""I have watch and ward to keep"
4590,THE LAST CHANTEY,"O'er Thy wonders on the deep,"

4594,THE LAST CHANTEY,"""Nay, but we were angry, and a hasty folk are we!"
4595,THE LAST CHANTEY,If we worked the ship together
4596,THE LAST CHANTEY,"Till she foundered in foul weather,"
4597,THE LAST CHANTEY,"Are we babes that we should clamour for a vengeance on the sea?"""
4598,THE LAST CHANTEY,
4599,THE LAST CHANTEY,Then said the souls of the slaves that men threw overboard:
4600,THE LAST CHANTEY,"""Kennelled in the picaroon a weary band were we;"
4601,THE LAST CHANTEY,"But Thy arm was strong to save,"
4602,THE LAST CHANTEY,"And it touched us on the wave,"

4604,THE LAST CHANTEY,
4605,THE LAST CHANTEY,Then cried the soul of the stout Apostle Paul to God:
4606,THE LAST CHANTEY,"""Once we frapped a ship, and she laboured woundily."
4607,THE LAST CHANTEY,"There were fourteen score of these,"
4608,THE LAST CHANTEY,"And they blessed Thee on their knees,"
4609,THE LAST CHANTEY,"When they learned Thy Grace and Glory under Malta by the sea!"""
4610,THE LAST CHANTEY,
4611,THE LAST CHANTEY,"Loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners,"
4612,THE LAST CHANTEY,"Plucking at their harps, and they plucked unhandily:"
4613,THE LAST CHANTEY,"""Our thumbs are rough and tarred,"
4614,THE LAST CHANTEY,And the tune is something hard --
4615,THE LAST CHANTEY,"May we lift a Deep-sea Chantey such as seamen use at sea?"""
4616,THE LAST CHANTEY,
4617,THE LAST CHANTEY,Then said the souls of the gentlemen-adventurers --
4618,THE LAST CHANTEY,Fettered wrist to bar all for red iniquity:
4619,THE LAST CHANTEY,"""Ho, we revel in our chains"
4620,THE LAST CHANTEY,O'er the sorrow that was Spain's;
4621,THE LAST CHANTEY,"Heave or sink it, leave or drink it, we were masters of the sea!"""
4622,THE LAST CHANTEY,
4623,THE LAST CHANTEY,Up spake the soul of a gray Gothavn 'speckshioner --
4624,THE LAST CHANTEY,(He that led the flinching in the fleets of fair Dundee):
4625,THE LAST CHANTEY,"""Oh, the ice-blink white and near,"

4627,THE LAST CHANTEY,"Will Ye whelm them all for wantonness that wallow in the sea?"""
4628,THE LAST CHANTEY,
4629,THE LAST CHANTEY,"Loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners,"
4630,THE LAST CHANTEY,"Crying:  ""Under Heaven, here is neither lead nor lee!"

4633,THE LAST CHANTEY,"Take back your golden fiddles and we'll beat to open sea!"""
4634,THE LAST CHANTEY,
4635,THE LAST CHANTEY,"Then stooped the Lord, and He called the good sea up to Him,"
4636,THE LAST CHANTEY,"And 'stablished his borders unto all eternity,"
4637,THE LAST CHANTEY,That such as have no pleasure
4638,THE LAST CHANTEY,"For to praise the Lord by measure,"

4702,THE MERCHANTMEN,
4703,THE MERCHANTMEN,Beyond all outer charting
4704,THE MERCHANTMEN,"We sailed where none have sailed,"
4705,THE MERCHANTMEN,And saw the land-lights burning

4707,THE MERCHANTMEN,"Our hair stood up for wonder,"
4708,THE MERCHANTMEN,"But, when the night was done,"

4715,THE MERCHANTMEN,And flared on vane and truck:
4716,THE MERCHANTMEN,"Till, through the red tornado,"
4717,THE MERCHANTMEN,"That lashed us nigh to blind,"
4718,THE MERCHANTMEN,"We saw The Dutchman plunging,"
4719,THE MERCHANTMEN,"Full canvas, head to wind!"
4720,THE MERCHANTMEN,
4721,THE MERCHANTMEN,We've heard the Midnight Leadsman

4730,THE MERCHANTMEN,"And north, amid the hummocks,"
4731,THE MERCHANTMEN,"A biscuit-toss below,"
4732,THE MERCHANTMEN,We met the silent shallop
4733,THE MERCHANTMEN,That frighted whalers know;
4734,THE MERCHANTMEN,"For, down a cruel ice-lane,"
4735,THE MERCHANTMEN,"That opened as he sped,"
4736,THE MERCHANTMEN,We saw dead Henry Hudson
4737,THE MERCHANTMEN,"Steer, North by West, his dead."

4773,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Ay, wrought it in the furnace-flame -- _my_ ""Institutio""."
4774,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,I cannot get my sleep to-night; old bones are hard to please;
4775,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,I'll stand the middle watch up here -- alone wi' God an' these
4776,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"My engines, after ninety days o' race an' rack an' strain"
4777,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Through all the seas of all Thy world, slam-bangin' home again."
4778,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Slam-bang too much -- they knock a wee -- the crosshead-gibs are loose;
4779,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,But thirty thousand mile o' sea has gied them fair excuse. . . .
4780,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Fine, clear an' dark -- a full-draught breeze, wi' Ushant out o' sight,"
4781,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"An' Ferguson relievin' Hay.  Old girl, ye'll walk to-night!"
4782,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,His wife's at Plymouth. . . .  Seventy --
4783,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,One -- Two -- Three since he began --
4784,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Three turns for Mistress Ferguson. . .and who's to blame the man?
4785,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"There's none at any port for me, by drivin' fast or slow,"
4786,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Since Elsie Campbell went to Thee, Lord, thirty years ago."
4787,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"(The year the _Sarah Sands_ was burned.  Oh roads we used to tread,"
4788,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Fra' Maryhill to Pollokshaws -- fra' Govan to Parkhead!)
4789,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Not but they're ceevil on the Board.  Ye'll hear Sir Kenneth say:
4790,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"""Good-morrn, M'Andrew!  Back again?  An' how's your bilge to-day?"""
4791,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Miscallin' technicalities but handin' me my chair
4792,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"To drink Madeira wi' three Earls -- the auld Fleet Engineer,"
4793,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,That started as a boiler-whelp -- when steam and he were low.
4794,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,I mind the time we used to serve a broken pipe wi' tow.
4795,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Ten pound was all the pressure then -- Eh!  Eh! -- a man wad drive;
4796,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"An' here, our workin' gauges give one hunder fifty-five!"
4797,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,We're creepin' on wi' each new rig -- less weight an' larger power:
4798,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,There'll be the loco-boiler next an' thirty knots an hour!
4799,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Thirty an' more.  What I ha' seen since ocean-steam began
4800,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Leaves me no doot for the machine:  but what about the man?
4801,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"The man that counts, wi' all his runs, one million mile o' sea:"
4802,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Four time the span from earth to moon. . . .  How far, O Lord, from Thee?"
4803,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,That wast beside him night an' day.  Ye mind my first typhoon?
4804,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,It scoughed the skipper on his way to jock wi' the saloon.
4805,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Three feet were on the stokehold-floor -- just slappin' to an' fro --
4806,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,An' cast me on a furnace-door.  I have the marks to show.
4807,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Marks!  I ha' marks o' more than burns -- deep in my soul an' black,"
4808,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"An' times like this, when things go smooth, my wickudness comes back."
4809,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"The sins o' four and forty years, all up an' down the seas,"
4810,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Clack an' repeat like valves half-fed. . . .  Forgie's our trespasses.
4811,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Nights when I'd come on deck to mark, wi' envy in my gaze,"
4812,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,The couples kittlin' in the dark between the funnel stays;
4813,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Years when I raked the ports wi' pride to fill my cup o' wrong --
4814,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Judge not, O Lord, my steps aside at Gay Street in Hong-Kong!"
4815,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Blot out the wastrel hours of mine in sin when I abode --
4816,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Jane Harrigan's an' Number Nine, The Reddick an' Grant Road!"
4817,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,An' waur than all -- my crownin' sin -- rank blasphemy an' wild.
4818,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,I was not four and twenty then -- Ye wadna judge a child?
4819,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"I'd seen the Tropics first that run -- new fruit, new smells, new air --"
4820,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,How could I tell -- blind-fou wi' sun -- the Deil was lurkin' there?
4821,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,By day like playhouse-scenes the shore slid past our sleepy eyes;
4822,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"By night those soft, lasceevious stars leered from those velvet skies,"
4823,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,In port (we used no cargo-steam) I'd daunder down the streets --
4824,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"An ijjit grinnin' in a dream -- for shells an' parrakeets,"
4825,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,An' walkin'-sticks o' carved bamboo an' blowfish stuffed an' dried --
4826,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Fillin' my bunk wi' rubbishry the Chief put overside.
4827,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Till, off Sambawa Head, Ye mind, I heard a land-breeze ca',"
4828,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Milk-warm wi' breath o' spice an' bloom:  ""M'Andrew, come awa'!"""
4829,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Firm, clear an' low -- no haste, no hate -- the ghostly whisper went,"
4830,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Just statin' eevidential facts beyon' all argument:
4831,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"""Your mither's God's a graspin' deil, the shadow o' yoursel',"
4832,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Got out o' books by meenisters clean daft on Heaven an' Hell.
4833,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"They mak' Him in the Broomielaw, o' Glasgie cold an' dirt,"
4834,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"A jealous, pridefu' fetich, lad, that's only strong to hurt,"
4835,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Ye'll not go back to Him again an' kiss His red-hot rod,"
4836,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"But come wi' Us"" (Now, who were _They_?) ""an' know the Leevin' God,"
4837,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"That does not kipper souls for sport or break a life in jest,"
4838,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"But swells the ripenin' cocoanuts an' ripes the woman's breast."""
4839,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"An' there it stopped:  cut off:  no more; that quiet, certain voice --"
4840,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"For me, six months o' twenty-four, to leave or take at choice."
4841,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,'Twas on me like a thunderclap -- it racked me through an' through --
4842,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Temptation past the show o' speech, unnameable an' new --"
4843,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"The Sin against the Holy Ghost? . . .  An' under all, our screw."
4844,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"That storm blew by but left behind her anchor-shiftin' swell,"
4845,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Thou knowest all my heart an' mind, Thou knowest, Lord, I fell."
4846,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Third on the _Mary Gloster_ then, and first that night in Hell!"
4847,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Yet was Thy hand beneath my head, about my feet Thy care --"
4848,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Fra' Deli clear to Torres Strait, the trial o' despair,"
4849,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,But when we touched the Barrier Reef Thy answer to my prayer!
4850,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"We dared not run that sea by night but lay an' held our fire,"
4851,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,An' I was drowsin' on the hatch -- sick -- sick wi' doubt an' tire:
4852,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"""_Better the sight of eyes that see than wanderin' o' desire!_"""
4853,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Ye mind that word?  Clear as our gongs -- again, an' once again,"
4854,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,When rippin' down through coral-trash ran out our moorin'-chain;
4855,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,An' by Thy Grace I had the Light to see my duty plain.
4856,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Light on the engine-room -- no more -- bright as our carbons burn.
4857,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"I've lost it since a thousand times, but never past return."
4858,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,
4859,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,.    .    .    .    .
4860,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,
4861,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Obsairve.  Per annum we'll have here two thousand souls aboard --
4862,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Think not I dare to justify myself before the Lord,"
4863,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,But -- average fifteen hunder souls safe-borne fra' port to port --
4864,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,I _am_ o' service to my kind.  Ye wadna blame the thought?
4865,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Maybe they steam from grace to wrath -- to sin by folly led, --"
4866,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,It isna mine to judge their path -- their lives are on my head.
4867,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Mine at the last -- when all is done it all comes back to me,"
4868,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,The fault that leaves six thousand ton a log upon the sea.
4869,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,We'll tak' one stretch -- three weeks an' odd by any road ye steer --
4870,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Fra' Cape Town east to Wellington -- ye need an engineer.
4871,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Fail there -- ye've time to weld your shaft -- ay, eat it, ere ye're spoke;"
4872,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Or make Kerguelen under sail -- three jiggers burned wi' smoke!
4873,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"An' home again, the Rio run:  it's no child's play to go"
4874,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Steamin' to bell for fourteen days o' snow an' floe an' blow --
4875,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,The bergs like kelpies overside that girn an' turn an' shift
4876,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Whaur, grindin' like the Mills o' God, goes by the big South drift."
4877,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"(Hail, snow an' ice that praise the Lord:  I've met them at their work,"
4878,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,An' wished we had anither route or they anither kirk.)
4879,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Yon's strain, hard strain, o' head an' hand, for though Thy Power brings"
4880,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"All skill to naught, Ye'll understand a man must think o' things."
4881,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Then, at the last, we'll get to port an' hoist their baggage clear --"
4882,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"The passengers, wi' gloves an' canes -- an' this is what I'll hear:"
4883,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"""Well, thank ye for a pleasant voyage.  The tender's comin' now."""
4884,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,While I go testin' follower-bolts an' watch the skipper bow.
4885,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"They've words for every one but me -- shake hands wi' half the crew,"
4886,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Except the dour Scots engineer, the man they never knew."
4887,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,An' yet I like the wark for all we've dam' few pickin's here --
4888,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"No pension, an' the most we earn's four hunder pound a year."
4889,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Better myself abroad?  Maybe.  _I'd_ sooner starve than sail
4890,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Wi' such as call a snifter-rod _ross_. . .French for nightingale.
4891,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Commeesion on my stores?  Some do; but I can not afford
4892,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,To lie like stewards wi' patty-pans --.  I'm older than the Board.
4893,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"A bonus on the coal I save?  Ou ay, the Scots are close,"
4894,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,But when I grudge the strength Ye gave I'll grudge their food to _those_.
4895,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,(There's bricks that I might recommend -- an' clink the fire-bars cruel.
4896,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,No!  Welsh -- Wangarti at the worst -- an' damn all patent fuel!)
4897,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Inventions?  Ye must stay in port to mak' a patent pay.
4898,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"My Deeferential Valve-Gear taught me how that business lay,"
4899,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,I blame no chaps wi' clearer head for aught they make or sell.
4900,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,_I_ found that I could not invent an' look to these -- as well.
4901,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"So, wrestled wi' Apollyon -- Nah! -- fretted like a bairn --"
4902,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,But burned the workin'-plans last run wi' all I hoped to earn.
4903,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Ye know how hard an Idol dies, an' what that meant to me --"
4904,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,E'en tak' it for a sacrifice acceptable to Thee. . . .
4905,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,_Below there!  Oiler!  What's your wark?  Ye find it runnin' hard?
4906,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Ye needn't swill the cap wi' oil -- this isn't the Cunard!
4907,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Ye thought?  Ye are not paid to think.  Go, sweat that off again!_"
4908,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Tck!  Tck!  It's deeficult to sweer nor tak' The Name in vain!
4909,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Men, ay an' women, call me stern.  Wi' these to oversee"
4910,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Ye'll note I've little time to burn on social repartee.
4911,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"The bairns see what their elders miss; they'll hunt me to an' fro,"
4912,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Till for the sake of -- well, a kiss -- I tak' 'em down below."
4913,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,That minds me of our Viscount loon -- Sir Kenneth's kin -- the chap
4914,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Wi' Russia leather tennis-shoon an' spar-decked yachtin'-cap.
4915,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"I showed him round last week, o'er all -- an' at the last says he:"
4916,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"""Mister M'Andrew, don't you think steam spoils romance at sea?"""
4917,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Damned ijjit!  I'd been doon that morn to see what ailed the throws,"
4918,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Manholin', on my back -- the cranks three inches off my nose."
4919,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Romance!  Those first-class passengers they like it very well,"
4920,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Printed an' bound in little books; but why don't poets tell?
4921,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,I'm sick of all their quirks an' turns -- the loves an' doves they dream --
4922,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Lord, send a man like Robbie Burns to sing the Song o' Steam!"
4923,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,To match wi' Scotia's noblest speech yon orchestra sublime
4924,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Whaurto -- uplifted like the Just -- the tail-rods mark the time.
4925,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"The crank-throws give the double-bass, the feed-pump sobs an' heaves,"
4926,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,An' now the main eccentrics start their quarrel on the sheaves:
4927,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Her time, her own appointed time, the rocking link-head bides,"
4928,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Till -- hear that note? -- the rod's return
4929,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,whings glimmerin' through the guides.
4930,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"They're all awa'!  True beat, full power, the clangin' chorus goes"
4931,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Clear to the tunnel where they sit, my purrin' dynamos."
4932,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Interdependence absolute, foreseen, ordained, decreed,"
4933,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"To work, Ye'll note, at any tilt an' every rate o' speed."
4934,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Fra' skylight-lift to furnace-bars, backed, bolted, braced an' stayed,"
4935,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,An' singin' like the Mornin' Stars for joy that they are made;
4936,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"While, out o' touch o' vanity, the sweatin' thrust-block says:"
4937,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"""Not unto us the praise, or man -- not unto us the praise!"""
4938,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Now, a' together, hear them lift their lesson -- theirs an' mine:"
4939,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"""Law, Orrder, Duty an' Restraint, Obedience, Discipline!"""
4940,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Mill, forge an' try-pit taught them that when roarin' they arose,"
4941,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,An' whiles I wonder if a soul was gied them wi' the blows.
4942,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Oh for a man to weld it then, in one trip-hammer strain,"
4943,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Till even first-class passengers could tell the meanin' plain!
4944,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,But no one cares except mysel' that serve an' understand
4945,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,My seven thousand horse-power here.
4946,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Eh, Lord!  They're grand -- they're grand!"
4947,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Uplift am I?  When first in store the new-made beasties stood,"
4948,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Were Ye cast down that breathed the Word declarin' all things good?
4949,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Not so!  O' that warld-liftin' joy no after-fall could vex,"
4950,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Ye've left a glimmer still to cheer the Man -- the Arrtifex!
4951,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"_That_ holds, in spite o' knock and scale, o' friction, waste an' slip,"
4952,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"An' by that light -- now, mark my word -- we'll build the Perfect Ship."
4953,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,I'll never last to judge her lines or take her curve -- not I.
4954,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"But I ha' lived an' I ha' worked. 'Be thanks to Thee, Most High!"
4955,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,An' I ha' done what I ha' done -- judge Thou if ill or well --
4956,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Always Thy Grace preventin' me. . . .
4957,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Losh!  Yon's the ""Stand by"" bell."
4958,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Pilot so soon?  His flare it is.  The mornin'-watch is set.
4959,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"Well, God be thanked, as I was sayin', I'm no Pelagian yet."
4960,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,Now I'll tak' on. . . .
4961,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,"_'Morrn, Ferguson.  Man, have ye ever thought"
4962,M'ANDREW'S HYMN,What your good leddy costs in coal? . . .  I'll burn 'em down to port._

4967,THE MIRACLES,THE MIRACLES
4968,THE MIRACLES,
4969,THE MIRACLES,
4970,THE MIRACLES,I sent a message to my dear --
4971,THE MIRACLES,A thousand leagues and more to Her --
4972,THE MIRACLES,"The dumb sea-levels thrilled to hear,"
4973,THE MIRACLES,And Lost Atlantis bore to Her.
4974,THE MIRACLES,
4975,THE MIRACLES,"Behind my message hard I came,"
4976,THE MIRACLES,And nigh had found a grave for me;
4977,THE MIRACLES,But that I launched of steel and flame
4978,THE MIRACLES,Did war against the wave for me.
4979,THE MIRACLES,
4980,THE MIRACLES,"Uprose the deep, by gale on gale,"
4981,THE MIRACLES,To bid me change my mind again --
4982,THE MIRACLES,"He broke his teeth along my rail,"
4983,THE MIRACLES,"And, roaring, swung behind again."
4984,THE MIRACLES,
4985,THE MIRACLES,I stayed the sun at noon to tell
4986,THE MIRACLES,My way across the waste of it;
4987,THE MIRACLES,I read the storm before it fell
4988,THE MIRACLES,And made the better haste of it.
4989,THE MIRACLES,
4990,THE MIRACLES,"Afar, I hailed the land at night --"
4991,THE MIRACLES,The towers I built had heard of me --
4992,THE MIRACLES,"And, ere my rocket reached its height,"
4993,THE MIRACLES,Had flashed my Love the word of me.
4994,THE MIRACLES,
4995,THE MIRACLES,Earth sold her chosen men of strength
4996,THE MIRACLES,(They lived and strove and died for me)
4997,THE MIRACLES,"To drive my road a nation's length,"
4998,THE MIRACLES,And toss the miles aside for me.
4999,THE MIRACLES,
5000,THE MIRACLES,I snatched their toil to serve my needs --
5001,THE MIRACLES,Too slow their fleetest flew for me --
5002,THE MIRACLES,"I tired twenty smoking steeds,"
5003,THE MIRACLES,And bade them bait a new for me.
5004,THE MIRACLES,
5005,THE MIRACLES,I sent the lightnings forth to see
5006,THE MIRACLES,Where hour by hour She waited me.
5007,THE MIRACLES,"Among ten million one was She,"
5008,THE MIRACLES,And surely all men hated me!
5009,THE MIRACLES,
5010,THE MIRACLES,Dawn ran to meet me at my goal --
5011,THE MIRACLES,"Ah, day no tongue shall tell again!"
5012,THE MIRACLES,And little folk of little soul
5013,THE MIRACLES,Rose up to buy and sell again!

5021,THE NATIVE-BORN,We've drunk to the Queen -- God bless her! --
5022,THE NATIVE-BORN,We've drunk to our mothers' land;
5023,THE NATIVE-BORN,We've drunk to our English brother
5024,THE NATIVE-BORN,(But he does not understand);
5025,THE NATIVE-BORN,"We've drunk to the wide creation,"
5026,THE NATIVE-BORN,And the Cross swings low for the morn;
5027,THE NATIVE-BORN,"Last toast, and of obligation,"
5028,THE NATIVE-BORN,A health to the Native-born!
5029,THE NATIVE-BORN,
5030,THE NATIVE-BORN,"They change their skies above them,"
5031,THE NATIVE-BORN,But not their hearts that roam!
5032,THE NATIVE-BORN,We learned from our wistful mothers
5033,THE NATIVE-BORN,"To call old England ""home"";"
5034,THE NATIVE-BORN,"We read of the English skylark,"
5035,THE NATIVE-BORN,"Of the spring in the English lanes,"

5037,THE NATIVE-BORN,As we rode on the dusty plains!
5038,THE NATIVE-BORN,
5039,THE NATIVE-BORN,They passed with their old-world legends --

5042,THE NATIVE-BORN,But we by the right of birth;

5050,THE NATIVE-BORN,"To the men of the Four New Nations,"

5210,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,
5211,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,Away by the lands of the Japanee
5212,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,Where the paper lanterns glow
5213,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And the crews of all the shipping drink
5214,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"In the house of Blood Street Joe,"
5215,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"At twilight, when the landward breeze"
5216,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Brings up the harbour noise,"

5219,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,In Cisco's Dewdrop Dining-Rooms
5220,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,They tell the tale anew
5221,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Of a hidden sea and a hidden fight,"
5222,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,When the _Baltic_ ran from the _Northern Light_
5223,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And the _Stralsund_ fought the two.
5224,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,
5225,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Now this is the Law of the Muscovite, that he proves with shot and steel,"
5226,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"When ye come by his isles in the Smoky Sea ye must not take the seal,"
5227,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Where the gray sea goes nakedly between the weed-hung shelves,"
5228,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And the little blue fox he is bred for his skin
5229,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,and the seal they breed for themselves;
5230,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"For when the _matkas_ seek the shore to drop their pups aland,"
5231,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"The great man-seal haul out of the sea, a-roaring, band by band;"
5232,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And when the first September gales have slaked their rutting-wrath,"
5233,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,The great man-seal haul back to the sea and no man knows their path.
5234,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Then dark they lie and stark they lie -- rookery, dune, and floe,"
5235,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And the Northern Lights come down o' nights to dance with the houseless snow;
5236,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And God Who clears the grounding berg and steers the grinding floe,"
5237,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,He hears the cry of the little kit-fox and the wind along the snow.
5238,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"But since our women must walk gay and money buys their gear,"
5239,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,The sealing-boats they filch that way at hazard year by year.
5240,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"English they be and Japanee that hang on the Brown Bear's flank,"
5241,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And some be Scot, but the worst of the lot, and the boldest thieves, be Yank!"
5242,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,
5243,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"It was the sealer _Northern Light_, to the Smoky Seas she bore,"
5244,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,With a stovepipe stuck from a starboard port and the Russian flag at her fore.
5245,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"(_Baltic_, _Stralsund_, and _Northern Light_ --"
5246,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,oh! they were birds of a feather --
5247,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Slipping away to the Smoky Seas, three seal-thieves together!)"
5248,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And at last she came to a sandy cove and the Baltic lay therein,"
5249,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,But her men were up with the herding seal to drive and club and skin.
5250,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"There were fifteen hundred skins abeach, cool pelt and proper fur,"
5251,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,When the _Northern Light_ drove into the bight
5252,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,and the sea-mist drove with her.
5253,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,The _Baltic_ called her men and weighed -- she could not choose but run --
5254,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"For a stovepipe seen through the closing mist, it shows like a four-inch gun."
5255,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,(And loss it is that is sad as death to lose both trip and ship
5256,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And lie for a rotting contraband on Vladivostock slip.)
5257,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"She turned and dived in the sea-smother as a rabbit dives in the whins,"
5258,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And the _Northern Light_ sent up her boats to steal the stolen skins.
5259,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"They had not brought a load to side or slid their hatches clear,"
5260,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"When they were aware of a sloop-of-war, ghost-white and very near."
5261,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Her flag she showed, and her guns she showed -- three of them, black, abeam,"
5262,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And a funnel white with the crusted salt, but never a show of steam."
5263,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,
5264,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"There was no time to man the brakes, they knocked the shackle free,"
5265,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And the _Northern Light_ stood out again, goose-winged to open sea."
5266,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"(For life it is that is worse than death, by force of Russian law"
5267,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,To work in the mines of mercury that loose the teeth in your jaw.)
5268,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,They had not run a mile from shore -- they heard no shots behind --
5269,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,When the skipper smote his hand on his thigh and threw her up in the wind:
5270,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"""Bluffed -- raised out on a bluff,"" said he, ""for if my name's Tom Hall,"
5271,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,You must set a thief to catch a thief -- and a thief has caught us all!
5272,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"By every butt in Oregon and every spar in Maine,"
5273,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,The hand that spilled the wind from her sail was the hand of Reuben Paine!
5274,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"He has rigged and trigged her with paint and spar,"
5275,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"and, faith, he has faked her well --"
5276,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,But I'd know the _Stralsund_'s deckhouse yet from here to the booms o' Hell.
5277,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Oh, once we ha' met at Baltimore, and twice on Boston pier,"
5278,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"But the sickest day for you, Reuben Paine, was the day that you came here --"
5279,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"The day that you came here, my lad, to scare us from our seal"
5280,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"With your funnel made o' your painted cloth, and your guns o' rotten deal!"
5281,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Ring and blow for the _Baltic_ now, and head her back to the bay,"
5282,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And we'll come into the game again -- with a double deck to play!"""
5283,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,
5284,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,They rang and blew the sealers' call -- the poaching cry of the sea --
5285,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And they raised the _Baltic_ out of the mist, and an angry ship was she:"
5286,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And blind they groped through the whirling white and blind to the bay again,"
5287,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,Till they heard the creak of the _Stralsund_'s boom
5288,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,and the clank of her mooring chain.
5289,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"They laid them down by bitt and boat, their pistols in their belts,"
5290,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And:  ""Will you fight for it, Reuben Paine, or will you share the pelts?"""
5291,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,
5292,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"A dog-toothed laugh laughed Reuben Paine, and bared his flenching-knife."
5293,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"""Yea, skin for skin, and all that he hath a man will give for his life;"
5294,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"But I've six thousand skins below, and Yeddo Port to see,"
5295,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And there's never a law of God or man runs north of Fifty-Three:
5296,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"So go in peace to the naked seas with empty holds to fill,"
5297,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And I'll be good to your seal this catch, as many as I shall kill!"""
5298,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,
5299,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Answered the snap of a closing lock and the jar of a gun-butt slid,"
5300,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,But the tender fog shut fold on fold to hide the wrong they did.
5301,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"The weeping fog rolled fold on fold the wrath of man to cloak,"
5302,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And the flame-spurts pale ran down the rail as the sealing-rifles spoke.
5303,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"The bullets bit on bend and butt, the splinter slivered free"
5304,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"(Little they trust to sparrow-dust that stop the seal in his sea!),"
5305,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"The thick smoke hung and would not shift, leaden it lay and blue,"
5306,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,But three were down on the _Baltic_'s deck and two of the _Stralsund_'s crew.
5307,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"An arm's-length out and overside the banked fog held them bound,"
5308,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"But, as they heard or groan or word, they fired at the sound."
5309,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"For one cried out on the Name of God, and one to have him cease,"
5310,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And the questing volley found them both and bade them hold their peace;
5311,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And one called out on a heathen joss and one on the Virgin's Name,"
5312,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And the schooling bullet leaped across and showed them whence they came.
5313,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And in the waiting silences the rudder whined beneath,"
5314,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And each man drew his watchful breath slow taken 'tween the teeth --
5315,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Trigger and ear and eye acock, knit brow and hard-drawn lips --"
5316,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,Bracing his feet by chock and cleat for the rolling of the ships.
5317,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Till they heard the cough of a wounded man that fought in the fog for breath,"
5318,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,Till they heard the torment of Reuben Paine that wailed upon his death:
5319,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,
5320,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"""The tides they'll go through Fundy Race but I'll go nevermore"
5321,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And see the hogs from ebb-tide mark turn scampering back to shore.
5322,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"No more I'll see the trawlers drift below the Bass Rock ground,"
5323,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,Or watch the tall Fall steamer lights tear blazing up the Sound.
5324,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Sorrow is me, in a lonely sea and a sinful fight I fall,"
5325,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"But if there's law o' God or man you'll swing for it yet, Tom Hall!"""
5326,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Tom Hall stood up by the quarter-rail.  ""Your words in your teeth,"" said he."
5327,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"""There's never a law of God or man runs north of Fifty-Three."
5328,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"So go in grace with Him to face, and an ill-spent life behind,"
5329,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And I'll be good to your widows, Rube, as many as I shall find."""
5330,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,
5331,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"A _Stralsund_ man shot blind and large, and a war-lock Finn was he,"
5332,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And he hit Tom Hall with a bursting ball a hand's-breadth over the knee.
5333,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Tom Hall caught hold by the topping-lift, and sat him down with an oath,"
5334,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"""You'll wait a little, Rube,"" he said, ""the Devil has called for both."
5335,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"The Devil is driving both this tide, and the killing-grounds are close,"
5336,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And we'll go up to the Wrath of God as the holluschickie goes.
5337,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"O men, put back your guns again and lay your rifles by,"
5338,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"We've fought our fight, and the best are down.  Let up and let us die!"
5339,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Quit firing, by the bow there -- quit!  Call off the _Baltic_'s crew!"
5340,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"You're sure of Hell as me or Rube -- but wait till we get through."""
5341,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"There went no word between the ships, but thick and quick and loud"
5342,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"The life-blood drummed on the dripping decks,"
5343,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"with the fog-dew from the shroud,"
5344,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"The sea-pull drew them side by side, gunnel to gunnel laid,"
5345,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And they felt the sheerstrakes pound and clear, but never a word was said."
5346,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,
5347,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,Then Reuben Paine cried out again before his spirit passed:
5348,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"""Have I followed the sea for thirty years to die in the dark at last?"
5349,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,Curse on her work that has nipped me here with a shifty trick unkind --
5350,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"I have gotten my death where I got my bread, but I dare not face it blind."
5351,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,Curse on the fog!  Is there never a wind of all the winds I knew
5352,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"To clear the smother from off my chest, and let me look at the blue?"""
5353,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"The good fog heard -- like a splitten sail, to left and right she tore,"
5354,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And they saw the sun-dogs in the haze and the seal upon the shore.
5355,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"Silver and gray ran spit and bay to meet the steel-backed tide,"
5356,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,And pinched and white in the clearing light the crews stared overside.
5357,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"O rainbow-gay the red pools lay that swilled and spilled and spread,"
5358,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"And gold, raw gold, the spent shell rolled between the careless dead --"
5359,THE RHYME OF THE THREE SEALERS,"The dead that rocked so drunkenwise to weather and to lee,"

7717,THE JACKET,"But the Captain 'ad 'is jacket, an' the jacket it was new --"
7718,THE JACKET,"('Orse Gunners, listen to my song!)"
7719,THE JACKET,"An' the wettin' of the jacket is the proper thing to do,"

7721,THE JACKET,
7722,THE JACKET,"One day they gave us orders for to shell a sand redoubt,"
7723,THE JACKET,Loadin' down the axle-arms with case;
7724,THE JACKET,"But the Captain knew 'is dooty, an' he took the crackers out"
7725,THE JACKET,An' he put some proper liquor in its place.
7726,THE JACKET,"An' the Captain saw the shrapnel, which is six-an'-thirty clear."

7731,THE JACKET,
7732,THE JACKET,"Then we trotted gentle, not to break the bloomin' glass,"
7733,THE JACKET,Though the Arabites 'ad all their ranges marked;
7734,THE JACKET,"But we dursn't 'ardly gallop, for the most was bottled Bass,"
7735,THE JACKET,An' we'd dreamed of it since we was disembarked:
7736,THE JACKET,"So we fired economic with the shells we 'ad in 'and,"
7737,THE JACKET,"('Orse Gunners, listen to my song!)"
7738,THE JACKET,"But the beggars under cover 'ad the impidence to stand,"
7739,THE JACKET,An' we couldn't keep 'em waitin' very long.
7740,THE JACKET,"_And the Captain, etc._"
7741,THE JACKET,
7742,THE JACKET,"So we finished 'arf the liquor (an' the Captain took champagne),"
7743,THE JACKET,An' the Arabites was shootin' all the while;
7744,THE JACKET,"An' we left our wounded 'appy with the empties on the plain,"
7745,THE JACKET,An' we used the bloomin' guns for pro-jec-tile!
7746,THE JACKET,We limbered up an' galloped -- there were nothin' else to do --
7747,THE JACKET,"('Orse Gunners, listen to my song!)"
7748,THE JACKET,"An' the Battery came a-boundin' like a boundin' kangaroo,"
7749,THE JACKET,But they didn't watch us comin' very long.
7750,THE JACKET,"_As the Captain, etc._"
7751,THE JACKET,
7752,THE JACKET,"We was goin' most extended -- we was drivin' very fine,"
7753,THE JACKET,"An' the Arabites were loosin' 'igh an' wide,"
7754,THE JACKET,"Till the Captain took the glassy with a rattlin' right incline,"
7755,THE JACKET,An' we dropped upon their 'eads the other side.
7756,THE JACKET,"Then we give 'em quarter -- such as 'adn't up and cut,"
7757,THE JACKET,"('Orse Gunners, listen to my song!)"
7758,THE JACKET,"An' the Captain stood a limberful of fizzy -- somethin' Brutt,"
7759,THE JACKET,But we didn't leave it fizzing very long.
7760,THE JACKET,"_For the Captain, etc._"
7761,THE JACKET,
7762,THE JACKET,"We might ha' been court-martialled, but it all come out all right"
7763,THE JACKET,When they signalled us to join the main command.
7764,THE JACKET,"There was every round expended, there was every gunner tight,"

8032,FOR TO ADMIRE,"The Lascar sings, ""_Hum deckty hai!_""                 [""I'm looking out.""]"
8033,FOR TO ADMIRE,
8034,FOR TO ADMIRE,"For to admire an' for to see,"
8035,FOR TO ADMIRE,For to be'old this world so wide --
8036,FOR TO ADMIRE,"It never done no good to me,"
8037,FOR TO ADMIRE,But I can't drop it if I tried!
8038,FOR TO ADMIRE,
8039,FOR TO ADMIRE,"I see the sergeants pitchin' quoits,"
8040,FOR TO ADMIRE,"I 'ear the women laugh an' talk,"
8041,FOR TO ADMIRE,I spy upon the quarter-deck
8042,FOR TO ADMIRE,The orficers an' lydies walk.
8043,FOR TO ADMIRE,"I thinks about the things that was,"
8044,FOR TO ADMIRE,"An' leans an' looks acrost the sea,"
8045,FOR TO ADMIRE,Till spite of all the crowded ship
8046,FOR TO ADMIRE,There's no one lef' alive but me.
8047,FOR TO ADMIRE,
8048,FOR TO ADMIRE,"The things that was which I 'ave seen,"
8049,FOR TO ADMIRE,"In barrick, camp, an' action too,"
8050,FOR TO ADMIRE,"I tells them over by myself,"
8051,FOR TO ADMIRE,An' sometimes wonders if they're true;
8052,FOR TO ADMIRE,For they was odd -- most awful odd --
8053,FOR TO ADMIRE,"But all the same now they are o'er,"
8054,FOR TO ADMIRE,"There must be 'eaps o' plenty such,"
8055,FOR TO ADMIRE,An' if I wait I'll see some more.
8056,FOR TO ADMIRE,
8057,FOR TO ADMIRE,"Oh, I 'ave come upon the books,"
8058,FOR TO ADMIRE,"An' frequent broke a barrick rule,"
8059,FOR TO ADMIRE,An' stood beside an' watched myself
8060,FOR TO ADMIRE,Be'avin' like a bloomin' fool.
8061,FOR TO ADMIRE,"I paid my price for findin' out,"
8062,FOR TO ADMIRE,"Nor never grutched the price I paid,"
8063,FOR TO ADMIRE,"But sat in Clink without my boots,"
8064,FOR TO ADMIRE,Admirin' 'ow the world was made.
8065,FOR TO ADMIRE,
8066,FOR TO ADMIRE,"Be'old a crowd upon the beam,"
8067,FOR TO ADMIRE,An' 'umped above the sea appears
8068,FOR TO ADMIRE,"Old Aden, like a barrick-stove"
8069,FOR TO ADMIRE,That no one's lit for years an' years!
8070,FOR TO ADMIRE,"I passed by that when I began,"
8071,FOR TO ADMIRE,"An' I go 'ome the road I came,"
8072,FOR TO ADMIRE,A time-expired soldier-man
8073,FOR TO ADMIRE,With six years' service to 'is name.
8074,FOR TO ADMIRE,
8075,FOR TO ADMIRE,"My girl she said, ""Oh, stay with me!"""

8077,FOR TO ADMIRE,"They've never written none, an' so"
8078,FOR TO ADMIRE,They must 'ave gone with all the rest --
8079,FOR TO ADMIRE,With all the rest which I 'ave seen
8080,FOR TO ADMIRE,An' found an' known an' met along.
8081,FOR TO ADMIRE,"I cannot say the things I feel,"
8082,FOR TO ADMIRE,And so I sing my evenin' song:
