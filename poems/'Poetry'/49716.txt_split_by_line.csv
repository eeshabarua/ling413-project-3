56,NOTE,
57,NOTE,"THE last fifteen pieces in this book, which are founded on odes of"
58,NOTE,"Hafez, are not translations. Their aim is rather to convey if possible"
59,NOTE,something of the original spirit than to give a faithful rendering of
60,NOTE,"either thought or form; & I have not scrupled to omit, insert, alter or"
61,NOTE,even deliberately to pervert the idea as fancy or feeling dictated. Some
62,NOTE,"of the poems follow the Persian fairly closely (especially nos. 30, 31,"
63,NOTE,"34, & 35); others are merely founded on or suggested by one or two"
64,NOTE,couplets.
65,NOTE,
66,NOTE,No. 4 was suggested by a Persian dialect quatrain by Baba Tahir.
67,NOTE,
68,NOTE,The remainder are original.

115,A. A. D.,"‘Whither, glad light, away?"
116,A. A. D.,"Take me, O take me too!’"

144,A. A. D.,"I gave thee birth, thou shalt return to me."
145,A. A. D.,
146,A. A. D.,Thy heart is light as the empty wind
147,A. A. D.,"Of barren purposeless change,—but I"
148,A. A. D.,Am the thought-burden’d slow-searching mind:
149,A. A. D.,I am the agony to form & find;—

427,SONG,"From some soft climate of Elysian field,"
428,SONG,Garmented in its own ethereal flame;
429,SONG,
430,SONG,"When first from heav’n’s high peace it enter’d here,"

434,SONG,"Seeing in every face its own sweet face,"

451,SONG,"Set store on riches, & for these alone:"
452,SONG,For these two glories only do they prize
453,SONG,Power & majesty of kingly throne:
454,SONG,
455,SONG,"Or this: to succour friendship in distress,"
456,SONG,"To comfort humble sorrow, nor despise"
457,SONG,"To cheer the joyless heart of weariness,"
458,SONG,To guard & aid whom fortune doth oppress
459,SONG,That he to life’s glad kingdom be restor’d
460,SONG,(& thus their monument of thanks they raise
461,SONG,"More high than pomp’s vain pinnacle of praise),"
462,SONG,

477,SONG,"Nor doth she vaunt afar her heart’s hid prize,"
478,SONG,Nor with wide-lavish’d scent of hope allure
479,SONG,"Ere men behold her, nor with rich disguise."
480,SONG,
481,SONG,"Nor hath she wit, that sword wherewith to smart"
482,SONG,"Delicate souls, with flashing stroke unsure"
483,SONG,"Of sharp misprise, wounding some gentle heart."
484,SONG,
485,SONG,"Yet not unlovely she, my silent rose,"

934,DAWN,"Or ever thou receive this ruby red,"
