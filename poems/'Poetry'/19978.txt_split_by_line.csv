11,I.,I.
12,I.,
13,I.,
14,I.,Whether we write or speak or do but look
15,I.,We are ever unapparent. What we are
16,I.,Cannot be transfused into word or book.
17,I.,Our soul from us is infinitely far.
18,I.,However much we give our thoughts the will
19,I.,"To be our soul and gesture it abroad,"
20,I.,Our hearts are incommunicable still.
21,I.,In what we show ourselves we are ignored.
22,I.,The abyss from soul to soul cannot be bridged
23,I.,By any skill of thought or trick of seeming.
24,I.,Unto our very selves we are abridged
25,I.,When we would utter to our thought our being.
26,I.,"We are our dreams of ourselves, souls by gleams,"
27,I.,And each to each other dreams of others’ dreams.
28,I.,
29,I.,
30,I.,
31,I.,
32,II.,II.
33,II.,
34,II.,
35,II.,If that apparent part of life’s delight
36,II.,Our tingled flesh-sense circumscribes were seen
37,II.,"By aught save reflex and co-carnal sight,"
38,II.,"Joy, flesh and life might prove but a gross screen."
39,II.,"Haply Truth’s body is no eyable being,"
40,II.,"Appearance even as appearance lies,"
41,II.,"Haply our close, dark, vague, warm sense of seeing"
42,II.,Is the choked vision of blindfolded eyes.
43,II.,Wherefrom what comes to thought’s sense of life? Nought.
44,II.,All is either the irrational world we see
45,II.,Or some aught-else whose being-unknown doth rot
46,II.,Its use for our thought’s use. Whence taketh me
47,II.,"A qualm-like ache of life, a body-deep"
48,II.,Soul-hate of what we seek and what we weep.
49,II.,
50,II.,
51,II.,
52,II.,
53,III.,III.
54,III.,
55,III.,
56,III.,When I do think my meanest line shall be
57,III.,"More in Time’s use than my creating whole,"
58,III.,That future eyes more clearly shall feel me
59,III.,In this inked page than in my direct soul;
60,III.,When I conjecture put to make me seeing
61,III.,"Good readers of me in some aftertime,"
62,III.,Thankful to some idea of my being
63,III.,That doth not even my with gone true soul rime;
64,III.,"An anger at the essence of the world,"
65,III.,"That makes this thus, or thinkable this wise,"
66,III.,Takes my soul by the throat and makes it hurled
67,III.,"In nightly horrors of despaired surmise,"
68,III.,And I become the mere sense of a rage
69,III.,That lacks the very words whose waste might ’suage.
70,III.,
71,III.,
72,III.,
73,III.,
74,IV.,IV.
75,IV.,
76,IV.,
77,IV.,"I could not think of thee as piecèd rot,"
78,IV.,"Yet such thou wert, for thou hadst been long dead;"
79,IV.,Yet thou liv’dst entire in my seeing thought
80,IV.,And what thou wert in me had never fled.
81,IV.,"Nay, I had fixed the moments of thy beauty—"
82,IV.,"Thy ebbing smile, thy kiss’s readiness,"
83,IV.,And memory had taught my heart the duty
84,IV.,To know thee ever at that deathlessness.
85,IV.,"But when I came where thou wert laid, and saw"
86,IV.,"The natural flowers ignoring thee sans blame,"
87,IV.,"And the encroaching grass, with casual flaw,"
88,IV.,"Framing the stone to age where was thy name,"
89,IV.,"I knew not how to feel, nor what to be"
90,IV.,Towards thy fate’s material secrecy.
91,IV.,
92,IV.,
93,IV.,
94,IV.,
95,V.,V.
96,V.,
97,V.,
98,V.,"How can I think, or edge my thoughts to action,"
99,V.,When the miserly press of each day’s need
100,V.,Aches to a narrowness of spilled distraction
101,V.,My soul appalled at the world’s work’s time-greed?
102,V.,How can I pause my thoughts upon the task
103,V.,My soul was born to think that it must do
104,V.,When every moment has a thought to ask
105,V.,To fit the immediate craving of its cue?
106,V.,The coin I’d heap for marrying my Muse
107,V.,And build our home i’th’ greater Time-to-be
108,V.,Becomes dissolved by needs of each day’s use
109,V.,"And I feel beggared of infinity,"
110,V.,"Like a true-Christian sinner, each day flesh-driven"
111,V.,By his own act to forfeit his wished heaven.
112,V.,
113,V.,
114,V.,
115,V.,
116,VI.,VI.
117,VI.,
118,VI.,
119,VI.,"As a bad orator, badly o’er-book-skilled,"
120,VI.,"Doth overflow his purpose with made heat,"
121,VI.,"And, like a clock, winds with withoutness willed"
122,VI.,What should have been an inner instinct’s feat;
123,VI.,"Or as a prose-wit, harshly poet turned,"
124,VI.,"Lacking the subtler music in his measure,"
125,VI.,"With useless care labours but to be spurned,"
126,VI.,Courting in alien speech the Muse’s pleasure;
127,VI.,"I study how to love or how to hate,"
128,VI.,"Estranged by consciousness from sentiment,"
129,VI.,With a thought feeling forced to be sedate
130,VI.,Even when the feeling’s nature is violent;
131,VI.,"As who would learn to swim without the river,"
132,VI.,"When nearest to the trick, as far as ever."
133,VI.,
134,VI.,
135,VI.,
136,VI.,
137,VII.,VII.
138,VII.,
139,VII.,
140,VII.,"Thy words are torture to me, that scarce grieve thee—"
141,VII.,That entire death shall null my entire thought;
142,VII.,"And I feel torture, not that I believe thee,"
143,VII.,But that I cannot disbelieve thee not.
144,VII.,Shall that of me that now contains the stars
145,VII.,Be by the very contained stars survived?
146,VII.,Thus were Fate all unjust. Yet what truth bars
147,VII.,An all unjust Fate’s truth from being believed?
148,VII.,Conjecture cannot fit to the seen world
149,VII.,"A garment of its thought untorn or covering,"
150,VII.,Or with its stuffed garb forge an otherworld
151,VII.,Without itself its dead deceit discovering;
152,VII.,"So, all being possible, an idle thought may"
153,VII.,"Less idle thoughts, self-known no truer, dismay."
154,VII.,
155,VII.,
156,VII.,
157,VII.,
158,VIII.,VIII.
159,VIII.,
160,VIII.,
161,VIII.,"How many masks wear we, and undermasks,"
162,VIII.,"Upon our countenance of soul, and when,"
163,VIII.,"If for self-sport the soul itself unmasks,"
164,VIII.,Knows it the last mask off and the face plain?
165,VIII.,The true mask feels no inside to the mask
166,VIII.,But looks out of the mask by co-masked eyes.
167,VIII.,Whatever consciousness begins the task
168,VIII.,The task’s accepted use to sleepness ties.
169,VIII.,"Like a child frighted by its mirrored faces,"
170,VIII.,"Our souls, that children are, being thought-losing,"
171,VIII.,Foist otherness upon their seen grimaces
172,VIII.,And get a whole world on their forgot causing;
173,VIII.,"And, when a thought would unmask our soul’s masking,"
174,VIII.,Itself goes not unmasked to the unmasking.
175,VIII.,
176,VIII.,
177,VIII.,
178,VIII.,
179,IX.,IX.
180,IX.,
181,IX.,
182,IX.,Oh to be idle loving idleness!
183,IX.,But I am idle all in hate of me;
184,IX.,"Ever in action’s dream, in the false stress"
185,IX.,Of purposed action never set to be.
186,IX.,"Like a fierce beast self-penned in a bait-lair,"
187,IX.,"My will to act binds with excess my action,"
188,IX.,"Not-acting coils the thought with raged despair,"
189,IX.,And acting rage doth paint despair distraction.
190,IX.,"Like someone sinking in a treacherous sand,"
191,IX.,Each gesture to deliver sinks the more;
192,IX.,"The struggle avails not, and to raise no hand,"
193,IX.,"Though but more slowly useless, we’ve no power."
194,IX.,"Hence live I the dead life each day doth bring,"
195,IX.,Repurposed for next day’s repurposing.

197,IX.,
198,IX.,
199,IX.,
200,X.,X.
201,X.,
202,X.,
203,X.,"As to a child, I talked my heart asleep"
204,X.,"With empty promise of the coming day,"
205,X.,And it slept rather for my words made sleep
206,X.,Than from a thought of what their sense did say.
207,X.,"For did it care for sense, would it not wake"
208,X.,And question closer to the morrow’s pleasure?
209,X.,"Would it not edge nearer my words, to take"
210,X.,The promise in the meting of its measure?
211,X.,"So, if it slept, ’twas that it cared but for"
212,X.,"The present sleepy use of promised joy,"
213,X.,Thanking the fruit but for the forecome flower
214,X.,Which the less active senses best enjoy.
215,X.,Thus with deceit do I detain the heart
216,X.,Of which deceit’s self knows itself a part.

221,XI.,XI.
222,XI.,
223,XI.,
224,XI.,"Like to a ship that storms urge on its course,"
225,XI.,By its own trials our soul is surer made.
226,XI.,The very things that make the voyage worse
227,XI.,Do make it better; its peril is its aid.
228,XI.,"And, as the storm drives from the storm, our heart"
229,XI.,Within the peril disimperilled grows;
230,XI.,A port is near the more from port we part—
231,XI.,The port whereto our driven direction goes.
232,XI.,"If we reap knowledge to cross-profit, this"
233,XI.,"From storms we learn, when the storm’s height doth drive—"
234,XI.,That the black presence of its violence is
235,XI.,The pushing promise of near far blue skies.
236,XI.,"Learn we but how to have the pilot-skill,"
237,XI.,And the storm’s very might shall mate our will.

239,XI.,
240,XI.,
241,XI.,
242,XII.,XII.
243,XII.,
244,XII.,
245,XII.,"As the lone, frighted user of a night-road"
246,XII.,"Suddenly turns round, nothing to detect,"
247,XII.,Yet on his fear’s sense keepeth still the load
248,XII.,Of that brink-nothing he doth but suspect;
249,XII.,And the cold terror moves to him more near
250,XII.,"Of something that from nothing casts a spell,"
251,XII.,"That, when he moves, to fright more is not there,"
252,XII.,And’s only visible when invisible
253,XII.,"So I upon the world turn round in thought,"
254,XII.,"And nothing viewing do no courage take,"
255,XII.,"But my more terror, from no seen cause got,"
256,XII.,"To that felt corporate emptiness forsake,"
257,XII.,And draw my sense of mystery’s horror from
258,XII.,Seeing no mystery’s mystery alone.
259,XII.,
260,XII.,
261,XII.,
262,XII.,
263,XIII.,XIII.
264,XIII.,
265,XIII.,
266,XIII.,When I should be asleep to mine own voice
267,XIII.,"In telling thee how much thy love’s my dream,"
268,XIII.,"I find me listening to myself, the noise"
269,XIII.,Of my words othered in my hearing them.
270,XIII.,Yet wonder not: this is the poet’s soul.
271,XIII.,"I could not tell thee well of how I love,"
272,XIII.,"Loved I not less by knowing it, were all"
273,XIII.,My self my love and no thought love to prove.
274,XIII.,"What consciousness makes more by consciousness,"
275,XIII.,"It makes less, for it makes it less itself,"
276,XIII.,My sense of love could not my love rich-dress
277,XIII.,Did it not for it spend love’s own love-pelf.
278,XIII.,Poet’s love’s this (as in these words I prove thee):
279,XIII.,I love my love for thee more than I love thee.

284,XIV.,XIV.
285,XIV.,
286,XIV.,
287,XIV.,"We are born at sunset and we die ere morn,"
288,XIV.,"And the whole darkness of the world we know,"
289,XIV.,"How can we guess its truth, to darkness born,"
290,XIV.,The obscure consequence of absent glow?
291,XIV.,Only the stars do teach us light. We grasp
292,XIV.,"Their scattered smallnesses with thoughts that stray,"
293,XIV.,"And, though their eyes look through night’s complete mask,"
294,XIV.,Yet they speak not the features of the day.
295,XIV.,Why should these small denials of the whole
296,XIV.,More than the black whole the pleased eyes attract?
297,XIV.,Why what it calls «worth» does the captive soul
298,XIV.,Add to the small and from the large detract?
299,XIV.,"So, put of light’s love wishing it night’s stretch,"
300,XIV.,A nightly thought of day we darkly reach.

302,XIV.,
303,XIV.,
304,XIV.,
305,XV.,XV.
306,XV.,
307,XV.,
308,XV.,Like a bad suitor desperate and trembling
309,XV.,"From the mixed sense of being not loved and loving,"
310,XV.,"Who with feared longing half would know, dissembling"
311,XV.,"With what he’d wish proved what he fears soon proving,"
312,XV.,"I look with inner eyes afraid to look,"
313,XV.,"Yet perplexed into looking, at the worth"
314,XV.,"This verse may have and wonder, of my book,"
315,XV.,To what thoughts shall’t in alien hearts give birth.
316,XV.,"But, as he who doth love, and, loving, hopes,"
317,XV.,"Yet, hoping, fears, fears to put proof to proof,"
318,XV.,"And in his mind for possible proofs gropes,"
319,XV.,"Delaying the true proof, lest the real thing scoff,"
320,XV.,"I daily live, i’th’ fame I dream to see,"
321,XV.,But by my thought of others’ thought of me.
322,XV.,
323,XV.,
324,XV.,
325,XV.,
326,XVI.,XVI.
327,XVI.,
328,XVI.,
329,XVI.,We never joy enjoy to that full point
330,XVI.,"Regret doth wish joy had enjoyèd been,"
331,XVI.,Nor have the strength regret to disappoint
332,XVI.,"Recalling not past joy’s thought, but its mien."
333,XVI.,Yet joy was joy when it enjoyèd was
334,XVI.,"And after-enjoyed when as joy recalled,"
335,XVI.,It must have been joy ere its joy did pass
336,XVI.,"And, recalled, joy still, since its being-past galled."
337,XVI.,"Alas! All this is useless, for joy’s in"
338,XVI.,"Enjoying, not in thinking of enjoying."
339,XVI.,"Its mere thought-mirroring gainst itself doth sin,"
340,XVI.,"By mere reflecting solid life destroying,"
341,XVI.,Yet the more thought we take to thought to prove
342,XVI.,"It must not think, doth further from joy move."
343,XVI.,
344,XVI.,
345,XVI.,
346,XVI.,
347,XVII.,XVII.
348,XVII.,
349,XVII.,
350,XVII.,"My love, and not I, is the egoist."
351,XVII.,My love for thee loves itself more than thee;
352,XVII.,"Ay, more than me, in whom it doth exist,"
353,XVII.,And makes me live that it may feed on me.
354,XVII.,In the country of bridges the bridge is
355,XVII.,More real than the shores it doth unsever;
356,XVII.,"So in our world, all of Relation, this"
357,XVII.,Is true—that truer is Love than either lover.
358,XVII.,This thought therefore comes lightly to Doubt’s door—
359,XVII.,"If we, seeing substance of this world, are not"
360,XVII.,"Mere Intervals, God’s Absence and no more,"
361,XVII.,Hollows in real Consciousness and Thought.
362,XVII.,"And if ’tis possible to Thought to bear this fruit,"
363,XVII.,Why should it not be possible to Truth?
364,XVII.,
365,XVII.,
366,XVII.,
367,XVII.,
368,XVIII.,XVIII.
369,XVIII.,
370,XVIII.,
371,XVIII.,"Indefinite space, which, by co-substance night,"
372,XVIII.,In one black mystery two void mysteries blends;
373,XVIII.,"The stray stars, whose innumerable light"
374,XVIII.,Repeats one mystery till conjecture ends;
375,XVIII.,"The stream of time, known by birth-bursting bubbles;"
376,XVIII.,"The gulf of silence, empty even of nought;"
377,XVIII.,"Thought’s high-walled maze, which the outed owner troubles"
378,XVIII.,Because the string’s lost and the plan forgot:
379,XVIII.,"When I think on this and that here I stand,"
380,XVIII.,"The thinker of these thoughts, emptily wise,"
381,XVIII.,Holding up to my thinking my thing-hand
382,XVIII.,"And looking at it with thought-alien eyes,"
383,XVIII.,The prayer of my wonder looketh past
384,XVIII.,The universal darkness lone and vast.
385,XVIII.,
386,XVIII.,
387,XVIII.,
388,XVIII.,
389,XIX.,XIX.
390,XIX.,
391,XIX.,
392,XIX.,"Beauty and love let no one separate,"
393,XIX.,"Whom exact Nature did to each other fit,"
394,XIX.,Giving to Beauty love as finishing fate
395,XIX.,And to Love beauty as true colour of it.
396,XIX.,"Let he but friend be who the soul finds fair,"
397,XIX.,"But let none love outside the body’s thought,"
398,XIX.,So the seen couple’s togetherness shall bear
399,XIX.,Truth to the beauty each in the other sought.
400,XIX.,I could but love thee out of mockery
401,XIX.,Of love and thee and mine own ugliness;
402,XIX.,"Therefore thy beauty I sing and wish not thee,"
403,XIX.,"Thanking the Gods I long not out of place,"
404,XIX.,"Lest, like a slave that for kings’ robes doth long,"
405,XIX.,"Obtained, shall with mere wearing do them wrong."
406,XIX.,
407,XIX.,
408,XIX.,
409,XIX.,
410,XX.,XX.
411,XX.,
412,XX.,
413,XX.,When in the widening circle of rebirth
414,XX.,"To a new flesh my travelled soul shall come,"
415,XX.,And try again the unremembered earth
416,XX.,"With the old sadness for the immortal home,"
417,XX.,Shall I revisit these same differing fields
418,XX.,"And cull the old new flowers with the same sense,"
419,XX.,"That some small breath of foiled remembrance yields,"
420,XX.,Of more age than my days in this pretence?
421,XX.,Shall I again regret strange faces lost
422,XX.,Of which the present memory is forgot
423,XX.,And but in unseen bulks of vagueness tossed
424,XX.,Out of the closed sea and black night of Thought?
425,XX.,"Were thy face one, what sweetness will’t not be,"
426,XX.,"Though by blind feeling, to remember thee!"
427,XX.,
428,XX.,
429,XX.,
430,XX.,
431,XXI.,XXI.
432,XXI.,
433,XXI.,
434,XXI.,"Thought was born blind, but Thought knows what is seeing."
435,XXI.,"Its careful touch, deciphering forms from shapes,"
436,XXI.,Still suggests form as aught whose proper being
437,XXI.,Mere finding touch with erring darkness drapes.
438,XXI.,"Yet whence, except from guessed sight, does touch teach"
439,XXI.,That touch is but a close and empty sense?
440,XXI.,"How does mere touch, self-uncontented, reach"
441,XXI.,For some truer sense’s whole intelligence?
442,XXI.,"The thing once touched, if touch be now omitted,"
443,XXI.,"Stands yet in memory real and outward known,"
444,XXI.,So the untouching memory of touch is fitted
445,XXI.,With sense of a sense whereby far things are shown
446,XXI.,"So, by touch of untouching, wrongly aright,"
447,XXI.,Touch’ thought of seeing sees not things but Sight.

453,XXII.,
454,XXII.,
455,XXII.,"My soul is a stiff pageant, man by man,"
456,XXII.,"Of some Egyptian art than Egypt older,"
457,XXII.,"Found in some tomb whose rite no guess can scan,"
458,XXII.,Where all things else to coloured dust did moulder.
459,XXII.,"Whate’er its sense may mean, its age is twin"
460,XXII.,"To that of priesthoods whose feet stood near God,"
461,XXII.,When knowledge was so great that ’twas a sin
462,XXII.,And man’s mere soul too man for its abode.
463,XXII.,But when I ask what means that pageant I
464,XXII.,"And would look at it suddenly, I lose"
465,XXII.,"The sense I had of seeing it, nor can try"
466,XXII.,"Again to look, nor hath my memory a use"
467,XXII.,"That seems recalling, save that it recalls"
468,XXII.,An emptiness of having seen those walls.

471,XXII.,
472,XXII.,
473,XXIII.,XXIII.
474,XXIII.,
475,XXIII.,
476,XXIII.,"Even as upon a low and cloud-domed day,"
477,XXIII.,"When clouds are one cloud till the horizon,"
478,XXIII.,Our thinking senses deem the sun away
479,XXIII.,And say «’tis sunless» and «there is no sun»;
480,XXIII.,And yet the very day they wrong truth by
481,XXIII.,"Is of the unseen sun’s effluent essence,"
482,XXIII.,"The very words do give themselves the lie,"
483,XXIII.,The very thought of absence comes from presence:
484,XXIII.,Even so deem we through Good of what is evil.
485,XXIII.,"He speaks of light that speaks of absent light,"
486,XXIII.,"And absent god, becoming present devil,"
487,XXIII.,Is still the absent god by essence’ right.
488,XXIII.,The withdrawn cause by being withdrawn doth get
489,XXIII.,(Being thereby cause still) the denied effect.

493,XXIII.,
494,XXIV.,XXIV.
495,XXIV.,
496,XXIV.,
497,XXIV.,Something in me was born before the stars
498,XXIV.,And saw the sun begin from far away.
499,XXIV.,"Our yellow, local day on its wont jars,"
500,XXIV.,For it hath communed with an absolute day.
501,XXIV.,"Through my Thought’s night, as a worn robe’s heard trail"
502,XXIV.,"That I have never seen, I drag this past"
503,XXIV.,That saw the Possible like a dawn grow pale
504,XXIV.,"On the lost night before it, mute and vast."
505,XXIV.,"It dates remoter than God’s birth can reach,"
506,XXIV.,That had no birth but the world’s coming after.
507,XXIV.,"So the world’s to me as, after whispered speech,"
508,XXIV.,The cause-ignored sudden echoing of laughter.
509,XXIV.,"That ’t has a meaning my conjecture knows,"
510,XXIV.,But that ’t has meaning’s all its meaning shows.

513,XXIV.,
514,XXIV.,
515,XXV.,XXV.
516,XXV.,
517,XXV.,
518,XXV.,We are in Fate and Fate’s and do but lack
519,XXV.,"Outness from soul to know ourselves its dwelling,"
520,XXV.,And do but compel Fate aside or back
521,XXV.,By Fate’s own immanence in the compelling.
522,XXV.,We are too far in us from outward truth

526,XXV.,"The doubleness of mind fails us, to glance"
527,XXV.,"At our exterior presence amid things,"
528,XXV.,Sizing from otherness our countenance
529,XXV.,And seeing our puppet will’s act-acting strings.

541,XXVI.,That when we hold to aught our thinking’s mirror
542,XXVI.,We know it not by knowing it thereby.
543,XXVI.,"For but one side of things the mirror knows,"
544,XXVI.,And knows it colded from its solidness.
545,XXVI.,A double lie its truth is; what it shows
546,XXVI.,By true show’s false and nowhere by true place.
547,XXVI.,"Thought clouds our life’s day-sense with strangeness, yet"
548,XXVI.,Never from strangeness more than that it’s strange
549,XXVI.,"Doth buy our perplexed thinking, for we get"

563,XXVII.,In irreparable sameness far away.
564,XXVII.,How the to-be is infinitely ever
565,XXVII.,"Out of the place wherein it will be Now,"
566,XXVII.,"Like the seen wave yet far up in the river,"
567,XXVII.,"Which reaches not us, but the new-waved flow!"
568,XXVII.,"This thing Time is, whose being is having none,"
569,XXVII.,"The equable tyrant of our different fates,"
