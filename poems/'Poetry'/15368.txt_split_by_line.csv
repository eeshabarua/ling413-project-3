45,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"_Fugitive Pieces_, Byron's first volume of verse, was privately"
46,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"printed in the autumn of 1806, when Byron was eighteen years of age."
47,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,Passages in Byron's correspondence indicate that as early as August
48,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,of that year some of the poems were in the printers' hands and that
49,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,during the latter part of August and during September the printing
50,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"was suspended in order that Byron might give his poems an ""entire"
51,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"new form."" The new form consisted, in part, in an enlargement; for he"
52,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,wrote to Elizabeth Pigot about September that he had nearly doubled
53,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"his poems ""partly by the discovery of some I conceived to be lost, and"
54,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"partly by some new productions."" According to Moore, _Fugitive Pieces_"
55,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,was ready for distribution in November. The last poem in the volume
56,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"bears the date of November 16, 1806."
57,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,
58,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,A difficulty in supposing the date of completion of the volume to be
59,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,about November 16 is that two copies contain inscriptions in Byron's
60,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"hand with earlier dates. On the copy of the late Mr. J.A. Spoor,"
61,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"of Chicago, the inscription reads: ""October 21st Tuesday 1806--Haec"
62,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"poemata ex dono sunt--Georgii Gordon Byron, Vale."" That on the"
63,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"copy in the Morgan library reads: ""Nov. 8, 1806, H.P.E.D.S.G.G.B.,"
64,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Southwell.--Vale!--Byron,"" the initials evidently standing for the"
65,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Latin words of the preceding inscription. The Latin ""Vale"" in each"
66,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"inscription, however, suggests that it commemorates a leave-taking,"
67,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,the date referring not to the presentation but to the farewell.
68,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,
69,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,It has been suggested that copies of the volume were distributed
70,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"earlier than November and that some of the poems, printed separately"
71,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"and distributed in fly-leaf form, were added later. This would explain"
72,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"such discrepancies as the early dates of the inscriptions, and the"
73,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,presence of Byron's name on pages 46 and 48 in a volume otherwise
74,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"anonymous, but there is little evidence to support it."
75,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,
76,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,Moore's account of _Fugitive Pieces_ is that it was distributed in
77,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"November, Byron presenting the first copy to the Reverend J.T. Becher,"
78,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"prebendary of Southwell minster, who objected to what he considered"
79,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"the too voluptuous coloring of the poem ""To Mary."" The objection led"
80,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Byron to suppress the edition immediately, he himself burning nearly"
81,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,every copy. This account is corroborated in part by Miss Pigot and in
82,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,part by Byron.
83,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,
84,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Immediately after the destruction, Byron began the preparation of a"
85,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"second volume, to replace _Fugitive Pieces_. This appeared in January,"
86,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"1807, as _Poems on Various Occasions_, Byron describing it as ""vastly"
87,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"correct and miraculously chaste."" Of the 38 poems that constitute"
88,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"_Fugitive Pieces_, all except ""To Mary,"" ""To Caroline,"" and the last"
89,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"six stanzas of ""To Miss E.P."" were reprinted in _Poems on Various"
90,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,Occasions_. Nineteen of the original 38 poems occur in Byron's third
91,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"work, _Hours of Idleness_, published in June or July, 1807. All three"
92,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"editions were printed by S. and J. Ridge, booksellers of Newark,"
93,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,England.
94,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,
95,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Byron himself never reprinted the poems ""To Mary"" or ""To Caroline,"" or"
96,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"the last six stanzas of ""To Miss E.P."" Except in a limited facsimile"
97,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"of _Fugitive Pieces_, supervised by H. Buxton Forman in 1886, ""To"
98,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Mary"" has never been reprinted--not even in supposedly complete"
99,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,editions of Byron's works.
100,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,
101,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Only four copies of _Fugitive Pieces_ are known to-day, and one of"
102,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,these is incomplete. The copy from which the present facsimile is made
103,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,was originally given by Byron to Becher and preserved by him in spite
104,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"of his objections to the poem ""To Mary."" From Becher's family it"
105,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"passed into the possession of Mr. Faulkner, of Louth, solicitor for"
106,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"the Becher family. In 1885 it was in the possession of H.W. Ball,"
107,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"antiquary and bookseller of Barton-on-Humber, who sold it to H. Buxton"
108,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Forman. Forman used it for his facsimile, but incorporated certain"
109,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"manuscript corrections of the original, so that his facsimile is not"
110,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"exact. The original is now owned by Mr. Thomas J. Wise, who has kindly"
111,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,permitted its use for the present facsimile.
112,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,
113,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Of the other three copies, the incomplete one, lacking pages 17-20"
114,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"(""To Mary"") and all after page 58, is in the possession of the family"
115,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"of the late Mr. H.C. Roe, of Nottingham. This was originally sent by"
116,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"Byron to Pigot, then studying medicine in Edinburgh. Byron later asked"
117,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,Pigot to destroy the copy and Pigot seems to have complied so far
118,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"as to tear out the offending verses ""To Mary."" For many years it was"
119,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,thought that only the Pigot and Becher copies had escaped destruction
120,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,at Byron's hands. But another complete copy came to light in 1907
121,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,and is now in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. This contains
122,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"numerous manuscript corrections and alterations, and seems to have"
123,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"been used as a proof copy for _Poems on Various Occasions_ (not, as"
124,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"has sometimes been stated, for _Hours of Idleness_). A fourth copy,"
125,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"also complete, was offered at public sale in 1912, and is now in the"
126,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"hands of the executors of the late Mr. J.A. Spoor, of Chicago."
127,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,
128,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,The present facsimile is an exact photographic reproduction of the
129,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"text with all typographical and other errors as in the original,"
130,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,except that certain manuscript corrections which appear in the
131,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"original perforce appear in the photographic reproduction, as follows:"

137,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"the second ""e"" of ""meets"" has"
138,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"been inserted to replace ""l."""

155,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"""l,"" but was changed by hand."
156,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,
157,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"The text has been collated with that in the Morgan library, and"
158,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"except for later corrections made in ink in the Morgan copy, the only"
159,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,differences noted are as follows:
160,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,
161,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"1.) On p. 5, in the first line of the footnote, the Morgan"
162,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"copy reads ""piece"" where the Wise copy reads ""p*ece,"" the"
163,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"""[dotless i]"" lacking."
164,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,
165,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,2.) The two pages of signature M are incorrectly numbered in
166,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"the Wise copy as ""41, 41,"" this copy having no page numbered"
167,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"42; and are incorrectly numbered in the Morgan copy as ""40,"
168,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,"42,"" the latter copy having no page numbered 41. The text of"
169,BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE,these pages is identical.
