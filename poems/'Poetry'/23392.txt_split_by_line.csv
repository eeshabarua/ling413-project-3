35,PREFACE,PREFACE
36,PREFACE,
37,PREFACE,There are two great traditions of womanhood. One presents the
38,PREFACE,"Madonna brooding over the mystery of motherhood; the other, more"
39,PREFACE,"confusedly, tells of the acolyte, the priestess, the clairvoyante of"
40,PREFACE,"the unknown gods. This latter exists complete in herself, a personality"
41,PREFACE,as definite and as significant as a symbol. She is behind all the
42,PREFACE,"processes of art, though she rarely becomes a conscious artist, except"
43,PREFACE,"in delicate and impassioned modes of living. Indeed, matters are cruelly"
44,PREFACE,complicated for her if the entanglements of destiny drag her forward
45,PREFACE,"into the deliberate aesthetic effort. Strange, wistful, bitter and"
46,PREFACE,"sweet, she troubles and quickens the soul of man, as earthly or as"
47,PREFACE,heavenly lover redeeming him from the spiritual sloth which is more
48,PREFACE,to be dreaded than any kind of pain.
49,PREFACE,
50,PREFACE,"The second tradition of womanhood does not perish; but, in these"
51,PREFACE,"present confusions of change, women of the more emotional and"
52,PREFACE,imaginative type are less potent than they have been and will be again.
53,PREFACE,They appear equally inimical and heretical to the opposing camps of
54,PREFACE,"hausfrau and of suffragist. Their intellectual forces, liberated and"
55,PREFACE,"intensified, prey upon the more instinctive part of their natures, vexing"
56,PREFACE,them with unanswerable questions. So Fiammetta mistakes herself to
57,PREFACE,"some degree, loses her keynote, becomes embittered and perplexed."
58,PREFACE,The equilibrium of soul and body is disturbed; and she fortifies herself
59,PREFACE,in an obstinate idealism that cannot come to terms with the assaults of
60,PREFACE,life. No single sonnet expresses absolute truth from even her own point
61,PREFACE,"of view. The verses present the moods, misconceptions, extravagances,"
62,PREFACE,"revulsions, reveries--all the obscure crises whereby she reaches a state"
63,PREFACE,"of illumination and reconciliation regarding the enigma of love as it is,"
64,PREFACE,making her transition from the purely romantic and ascetic ideal
65,PREFACE,fostered by the exquisitely selective conspiracies of the art of the great
66,PREFACE,"love-poets, through a great darkness of disillusion, to a new vision"
67,PREFACE,"infinitely stronger and sweeter, because unafraid of the whole truth."
68,PREFACE,
69,PREFACE,Fiammetta is frankly an enthusiast of the things of art; and her
70,PREFACE,meditations unfortunately betray the fact that Etruscan mirrors are as
71,PREFACE,"dear to her as the daisies, and that she cannot find it more virtuous to"
72,PREFACE,contemplate a few cows in a pasture than a group of Leonardo's people
73,PREFACE,in their rock-bound cloisters. For the long miracle of the human soul
74,PREFACE,and its expression is for her not less sacredly part of the universal
75,PREFACE,process than the wheeling of suns and planets: a Greek vase is to her as
76,PREFACE,intimately concerned with Nature as the growing corn--with that Nature
77,PREFACE,"who formed the swan and the peacock for decorative delight, and who"
78,PREFACE,puts ivory and ebony cunningly together on the blackthorn every
79,PREFACE,patterned Spring.
80,PREFACE,
81,PREFACE,The Shaksperean form of sonnet yields most readily the piercing
82,PREFACE,quality of sound that helps to describe a malady of the soul. But the
83,PREFACE,system of completed quatrains in that model suits more assured and
84,PREFACE,dominating passion than the present matter provides. A more agitated
85,PREFACE,"hurry of the syllables, a more involved sentence-structure, sometimes a"
86,PREFACE,"fainter rime-stress, seem necessary to the music of bewilderment."
