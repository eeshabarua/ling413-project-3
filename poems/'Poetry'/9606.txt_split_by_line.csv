71,A MEMORY,
72,A MEMORY,When those we love have passed away; when from our lives something has
73,A MEMORY,gone out; when with each successive day we miss the presence that has
74,A MEMORY,"become a part of ourselves, and struggle against the realization that"
75,A MEMORY,"it is with us no more, we begin to live in the past and thank God for"
76,A MEMORY,"the gracious boon of memory. Few of us there are who, having advanced"
77,A MEMORY,"to middle life, have not come to look back on the travelled road of"
78,A MEMORY,"human existence in thought of those who journeyed awhile with us, a"
79,A MEMORY,"part of all our hopes and joyousness, the sharers of all our ambitions"
80,A MEMORY,"and our pleasures, whose mission has been fulfilled and who have left"
81,A MEMORY,us with the mile-stones of years still seeming to stretch out on the
82,A MEMORY,"path ahead. It is then that memory comes with its soothing influence,"
83,A MEMORY,telling us of the happiness that was ours and comforting us with the
84,A MEMORY,ever recurring thought of the pleasures of that travelled road. For it
85,A MEMORY,"is happiness to walk and talk with a brother for forty years, and it is"
86,A MEMORY,"happiness to know that the surety of that brother's affection, the"
87,A MEMORY,"knowledge of the greatness of his heart and the nobility of his mind,"
88,A MEMORY,are not for one memory alone but may be publicly attested for
89,A MEMORY,admiration and emulation. That it has fallen to me to speak to the
90,A MEMORY,"world of my brother as I knew him I rejoice. I do not fear that,"
91,A MEMORY,"speaking as a brother, I shall crowd the laurel wreaths upon him, for"
92,A MEMORY,to this extent he lies in peace already honored; but if I can show him
93,A MEMORY,"to the world, not as a poet but as a man,--if I may lead men to see"
94,A MEMORY,"more of that goodness, sweetness, and gentleness that were in him, I"
95,A MEMORY,shall the more bless the memory that has survived.
96,A MEMORY,
97,A MEMORY,My brother was born in St. Louis in 1850. Whether the exact day was
98,A MEMORY,September 2 or September 3 was a question over which he was given to
99,A MEMORY,"speculation, more particularly in later years, when he was accustomed to"
100,A MEMORY,discuss it frequently and with much earnest ness. In his youth the
101,A MEMORY,"anniversary was generally held to be September 2, perhaps the result of"
102,A MEMORY,a half-humorous remark by my father that Oliver Cromwell had died
103,A MEMORY,"September 3, and he could not reconcile this date to the thought that it"
104,A MEMORY,"was an important anniversary to one of his children. Many years after,"
105,A MEMORY,"when my uncle, Charles Kellogg Field, of Vermont, published the"
106,A MEMORY,"genealogy of the Field family, the original date, September 3, was"
107,A MEMORY,"restored, and from that time my brother accepted it, although with each"
108,A MEMORY,"recurring anniversary the controversy was gravely renewed, much to the"
109,A MEMORY,"amusement of the family and always to his own perplexity. In November,"
110,A MEMORY,"1856, my mother died, and, at the breaking up of the family in St."
111,A MEMORY,"Louis, my brother and myself, the last of six children, were taken to"
112,A MEMORY,"Amherst, Massachusetts, by our cousin, Miss Mary F. French, who took"
113,A MEMORY,upon herself the care and responsibility of our bringing up. How nobly
114,A MEMORY,and self-sacrificingly she entered upon and discharged those duties my
115,A MEMORY,brother gladly testified in the beautiful dedication of his first
116,A MEMORY,"published poems, ""A Little Book of Western Verse,"" wherein he honored"
117,A MEMORY,"the ""gracious love"" in which he grew, and bade her look as kindly on the"
118,A MEMORY,faults of his pen as she had always looked on his own. For a few years
119,A MEMORY,"my brother attended a private school for boys in Amherst; then, at the"
120,A MEMORY,"age of fourteen, he was intrusted to the care of Rev. James Tufts, of"
121,A MEMORY,"Monson, one of those noble instructors of the blessed old school who are"
122,A MEMORY,passing away from the arena of education in America. By Mr. Tufts he was
123,A MEMORY,"fitted for college, and from the enthusiasm of this old scholar he"
124,A MEMORY,caught perhaps the inspiration for the love of the classics which he
125,A MEMORY,carried through life. In the fall of 1868 he entered Williams
126,A MEMORY,College--the choice was largely accidental--and remained there one year.
127,A MEMORY,"My father died in the summer of 1869, and my brother chose as his"
128,A MEMORY,"guardian Professor John William Burgess, now of Columbia University, New"
129,A MEMORY,"York City. When Professor Burgess, later in the summer, accepted a call"
130,A MEMORY,"to Knox College, Galesburg, Illinois, my brother accompanied him and"
131,A MEMORY,"entered that institution, but the restlessness which was so"
132,A MEMORY,characteristic of him in youth asserted itself after another year and
133,A MEMORY,"he joined me, then in my junior year at the University of Missouri, at"
134,A MEMORY,Columbia. It was at this institution that he finished his education so
135,A MEMORY,far as it related to prescribed study.
136,A MEMORY,
137,A MEMORY,"Shortly after attaining his majority he went to Europe, remaining six"
138,A MEMORY,months in France and Italy. From this European trip have sprung the
139,A MEMORY,absurd stories which have represented him as squandering thousands of
140,A MEMORY,dollars in the pursuit of pleasure. Unquestionably he had the not
141,A MEMORY,unnatural extravagance which accompanies youth and a most generous
142,A MEMORY,"disposition, for he was lavish and open-handed all through life to an"
143,A MEMORY,"unusual degree, but at no time was he particularly given to wild"
144,A MEMORY,"excesses, and the fact that my father's estate, which was largely"
145,A MEMORY,"realty, had shrunk perceptibly during the panic days of 1873 was enough"
146,A MEMORY,to make him soon reach the limit of even moderate extravagance. At the
147,A MEMORY,same time many good stories have been told illustrative of his contempt
148,A MEMORY,"for money, and it is eminently characteristic of his lack of the"
149,A MEMORY,Puritan regard for small things that one day he approached my father's
150,A MEMORY,"executor, Hon. M. L. Gray, of St. Louis, with a request for"
151,A MEMORY,seventy-five dollars.
152,A MEMORY,
153,A MEMORY,"""But,"" objected this cautious and excellent man, ""I gave you"
154,A MEMORY,"seventy-five dollars only yesterday, Eugene. What did you do with that?"""
155,A MEMORY,
156,A MEMORY,"""Oh,"" replied my brother, with an impatient and scornful toss of the"
157,A MEMORY,"head, ""I believe I bought some postage stamps."""
158,A MEMORY,
159,A MEMORY,"Before going to Europe he had met Miss Julia Sutherland Comstock, of St."
160,A MEMORY,"Joseph, Missouri, the sister of a college friend, and the attachment"
161,A MEMORY,"which was formed led to their marriage in October, 1873. Much of his"
162,A MEMORY,tenderest and sweetest verse was inspired by love for the woman who
163,A MEMORY,"became his wife, and the dedication to the ""Second Book of Verse"" is"
164,A MEMORY,"hardly surpassed for depth of affection and daintiness of sentiment,"
165,A MEMORY,"while ""Lover's Lane, St. Jo.,"" is the very essence of loyalty, love, and"
166,A MEMORY,reminiscential ardor. At the time of his marriage my brother realized
167,A MEMORY,"the importance of going to work in earnest, and shortly before the"
168,A MEMORY,appointment of the wedding-day he entered upon the active duties of
169,A MEMORY,"journalism, which he never relinquished during life. These duties, with"
170,A MEMORY,the exception of the year he passed in Europe with his family in
171,A MEMORY,"1889-90, were confined to the West. He began as a paragrapher in St."
172,A MEMORY,"Louis, quickly achieving somewhat more than a merely local reputation."
173,A MEMORY,"For a time he was in St. Joseph, and for eighteen months following"
174,A MEMORY,"January 1880 he lived in Kansas City, removing thence to Denver. In 1883"
175,A MEMORY,"he came to Chicago at the solicitation of Melville E. Stone, then editor"
176,A MEMORY,"of the Chicago Daily News, retaining his connection with the News and"
177,A MEMORY,"its offspring, the Record, until his death. Thus hastily have been"
178,A MEMORY,skimmed over the bare outlines of his life.
179,A MEMORY,
180,A MEMORY,"The formative period of my brother's youth was passed in New England,"
181,A MEMORY,and to the influences which still prevail in and around her peaceful
182,A MEMORY,"hills and gentle streams, the influences of a sturdy stock which has"
183,A MEMORY,sent so many good and brave men to the West for the upbuilding of the
184,A MEMORY,"country and the upholding of what is best in Puritan tradition, he"
185,A MEMORY,gladly acknowledged he owed much that was strong and enduring. While he
186,A MEMORY,gloried in the West and remained loyal to the section which gave him
187,A MEMORY,"birth, and in which he chose to cast his lot, he was not the less proud"
188,A MEMORY,of his New England blood and not the less conscious of the benefits of a
189,A MEMORY,New England training. His boyhood was similar to that of other boys
190,A MEMORY,"brought up with the best surroundings in a Massachusetts village, where"
191,A MEMORY,the college atmosphere prevailed. He had his boyish pleasures and his
192,A MEMORY,"trials, his share of that queer mixture of nineteenth-century"
193,A MEMORY,worldliness and almost austere Puritanism which is yet characteristic of
194,A MEMORY,"many New England families. The Sabbath was a veritable day of judgment,"
195,A MEMORY,and in later years he spoke humorously of the terrors of those all-day
196,A MEMORY,"sessions in church and Sunday-school, though he never failed to"
197,A MEMORY,acknowledge the benefits he had derived from an enforced study of the
198,A MEMORY,"Bible. ""If I could be grateful to New England for nothing else,"" he"
199,A MEMORY,"would say, ""I should bless her forevermore for pounding me with the"
200,A MEMORY,"Bible and the spelling-book."" And in proof of the earnestness of this"
201,A MEMORY,"declaration he spent many hours in Boston a year or two ago, trying to"
202,A MEMORY,"find ""one of those spellers that temporarily made me lose my faith in"
203,A MEMORY,"the system of the universe."""
204,A MEMORY,
205,A MEMORY,It is easy at this day to look back three decades and note the
206,A MEMORY,"characteristics which appeared trivial enough then, but which, clinging"
207,A MEMORY,"to him and developing, had a marked effect on his manhood and on the"
208,A MEMORY,direction of his talents. As a boy his fondness for pets amounted to a
209,A MEMORY,"passion, but unlike other boys he seemed to carry his pets into a higher"
210,A MEMORY,"sphere and to give them personality. For each pet, whether dog, cat,"
211,A MEMORY,"bird, goat, or squirrel--he had the family distrust of a horse--he not"
212,A MEMORY,"only had a name, but it was his delight to fancy that each possessed a"
213,A MEMORY,"peculiar dialect of human speech, and each he addressed in the humorous"
214,A MEMORY,manner conceived. He ignored the names in common use for domestic
215,A MEMORY,animals and chose or invented those more pleasing to his exuberant
216,A MEMORY,"fancy. This conceit was always with him, and years afterward, when his"
217,A MEMORY,"children took the place of his boyish pets, he gratified his whim for"
218,A MEMORY,strange names by ignoring those designated at the baptismal font and
219,A MEMORY,substituting freakish titles of his own riotous fancy. Indeed it must
220,A MEMORY,have been a tax on his imaginative powers. When in childhood he was
221,A MEMORY,"conducting a poultry annex to the homestead, each chicken was properly"
222,A MEMORY,"instructed to respond to a peculiar call, and Finnikin, Minnikin,"
223,A MEMORY,"Winnikin, Dump, Poog, Boog, seemed to recognize immediately the queer"
224,A MEMORY,intonations of their master with an intelligence that is not usually
225,A MEMORY,accorded to chickens. With this love for animal life was developed also
226,A MEMORY,that tenderness of heart which was so manifest in my brother's daily
227,A MEMORY,"actions. One day--he was then a good-sized boy--he came into the house,"
228,A MEMORY,"and throwing himself on the sofa, sobbed for half an hour. One of the"
229,A MEMORY,chickens hatched the day before had been crushed under his foot as he
230,A MEMORY,"was walking in the chicken-house, and no murderer could have felt more"
231,A MEMORY,keenly the pangs of remorse. The other boys looked on curiously at this
232,A MEMORY,"exhibition of feeling, and it was indeed an unusual outburst. But it was"
233,A MEMORY,"strongly characteristic of him through life, and nothing would so excite"
234,A MEMORY,"his anger as cruelty to an animal, while every neglected, friendless"
235,A MEMORY,dog or persecuted cat always found in him a champion and a friend.
236,A MEMORY,
237,A MEMORY,In illustration of this humane instinct it is recalled that a few weeks
238,A MEMORY,before he died a lady visiting the house found his room swarming with
239,A MEMORY,flies. In response to her exclamation of astonishment he explained that
240,A MEMORY,"a day or two before he had seen a poor, half-frozen fly on the"
241,A MEMORY,"window-pane outside, and he had been moved by a kindly impulse to open"
242,A MEMORY,"the window and admit her. ""And this,"" he added, ""is what I get for it."
243,A MEMORY,"That ungrateful creature is, as you perceive, the grandmother of eight"
244,A MEMORY,"thousand nine hundred and seventy-six flies!"""
245,A MEMORY,
246,A MEMORY,That the birds that flew about his house in Buena Park knew his voice
247,A MEMORY,has been demonstrated more than once. He would keep bread crumbs
248,A MEMORY,"scattered along the window-sill for the benefit, as he explained, of"
249,A MEMORY,the blue jays and the robins who were not in their usual robust health
250,A MEMORY,or were too overcome by the heat to make customary exertion. If the
251,A MEMORY,jays were particularly noisy he would go into the yard and expostulate
252,A MEMORY,"with them in a tone of friendly reproach, whereupon, the family"
253,A MEMORY,"affirms, they would apparently apologize and fly away. Once he"
254,A MEMORY,maintained at considerable expense a thoroughly hopeless and useless
255,A MEMORY,"donkey, and it was his custom, when returning from the office at any"
256,A MEMORY,"hour of the night, to go into the back yard and say ""Poor old Don"" in a"
257,A MEMORY,"bass voice that carried a block away, whereupon old Don would lift up"
258,A MEMORY,his own voice with a melancholy bray of welcome that would shake the
259,A MEMORY,windows and start the neighbors from their slumbers. Old Don is passing
260,A MEMORY,"his declining years in an ""Old Kentucky home,"" and the robins and the"
261,A MEMORY,blue jays as they return with the spring will look in vain for the
262,A MEMORY,friend who fed them at the window.
263,A MEMORY,
264,A MEMORY,"The family dog at Amherst, which was immortalized many years later with"
265,A MEMORY,"""The Bench-Legged Fyce,"" and which was known in his day to hundreds of"
266,A MEMORY,"students at the college on account of his surpassing lack of beauty,"
267,A MEMORY,"rejoiced originally in the honest name of Fido, but my brother rejected"
268,A MEMORY,"this name as commonplace and unworthy, and straightway named him"
269,A MEMORY,"""Dooley"" on the presumption that there was something Hibernian in his"
270,A MEMORY,"face. It was to Dooley that he wrote his first poem, a parody on ""O Had"
271,A MEMORY,"I Wings Like a Dove,"" a song then in great vogue. Near the head of the"
272,A MEMORY,"village street was the home of the Emersons, a large frame house, now"
273,A MEMORY,"standing for more than a century, and in the great yard in front stood"
274,A MEMORY,the magnificent elms which are the glory of the Connecticut valley. Many
275,A MEMORY,"times the boys, returning from school, would linger to cool off in the"
276,A MEMORY,"shade of these glorious trees, and it was on one of these occasions that"
277,A MEMORY,my brother put into the mouth of Dooley his maiden effort in verse:
278,A MEMORY,
279,A MEMORY,"O had I wings like a dove I would fly,"
280,A MEMORY,Away from this world of fleas;
281,A MEMORY,"I'd fly all round Miss Emerson's yard,"
282,A MEMORY,And light on Miss Emerson's trees.
283,A MEMORY,
284,A MEMORY,"Even this startling parody, which was regarded by the boys as a"
285,A MEMORY,"veritable stroke of genius, failed to impress the adult villagers with"
286,A MEMORY,the conviction that a poet was budding. Yet how much of quiet humor and
287,A MEMORY,lively imagination is betrayed by these four lines. How easy it is now
288,A MEMORY,to look back at the small boy and picture him sympathizing with his
289,A MEMORY,"little friend tormented by the heat and the pests of his kind, and"
290,A MEMORY,making him sigh for the rest that seemed to lurk in the rustling leaves
291,A MEMORY,of the stately elms. Perhaps it was not astonishing poetry even for a
292,A MEMORY,"child, but was there not something in the fancy, the sentiment, and the"
293,A MEMORY,rhythm which bespoke far more than ordinary appreciation? Is it not this
294,A MEMORY,same quality of alert and instinctive sympathy which has run through
295,A MEMORY,Eugene Field's writings and touched the spring of popular affection?
296,A MEMORY,
297,A MEMORY,Dooley went to the dog heaven many years ago. Finnikin and Poog and Boog
298,A MEMORY,and the scores of boyhood friends that followed them have passed to
299,A MEMORY,their Pythagorean reward; but the boy who first found in them the
300,A MEMORY,delight of companionship and the kindlings of imagination retained all
301,A MEMORY,the youthful impulses which made him for nearly half a century the lover
302,A MEMORY,of animal life and the gentle singer of the faithful and the good.
303,A MEMORY,
304,A MEMORY,Comradeship was the indispensable factor in my brother's life. It was
305,A MEMORY,strong in his youth; it grew to be an imperative necessity in later
306,A MEMORY,years. In the theory that it is sometimes good to be alone he had
307,A MEMORY,"little or no faith. Even when he was at work in his study, when it was"
308,A MEMORY,"almost essential to thought that he should be undisturbed, he was never"
309,A MEMORY,quite content unless aware of the presence of human beings near at
310,A MEMORY,"hand, as betrayed by their voices. It is customary to think of a poet"
311,A MEMORY,"wandering off in the great solitudes, standing alone in contemplation"
312,A MEMORY,"of the wonderful work of nature, on the cliffs overlooking the ocean,"
313,A MEMORY,in the paths of the forest or on the mountain side. My brother was not
314,A MEMORY,of this order. That he was primarily and essentially a poet of humanity
315,A MEMORY,and not of nature does not argue that he was insensible to natural
316,A MEMORY,beauty or natural grandeur. Nobody could have been more keenly
317,A MEMORY,"susceptible to the influences of nature in their temperamental effect,"
318,A MEMORY,and perhaps this may explain that he did not love nature the less but
319,A MEMORY,that he prized companionship more. If nature pleased him he longed for
320,A MEMORY,a friend to share his pleasure; if it appalled him he turned from it
321,A MEMORY,with repugnance and fear.
322,A MEMORY,
323,A MEMORY,Throughout his writings may be found the most earnest appreciation of
324,A MEMORY,"the joyousness and loveliness of a beautiful landscape, but as he would"
325,A MEMORY,share it intellectually with his readers so it was a necessity that he
326,A MEMORY,"could not seek it alone as an actuality. In his boyhood, in the full"
327,A MEMORY,"glory of a perfect day, he loved to ramble through the woods and"
328,A MEMORY,"meadows, and delighted in the azure tints of the far-away Berkshire"
329,A MEMORY,hills; and later in life he was keen to notice and admire the soft
330,A MEMORY,"harmonies of landscape, but with a change in weather or with the"
331,A MEMORY,approach of a storm the poet would be lost in the timidity and distrust
332,A MEMORY,of a child.
333,A MEMORY,
334,A MEMORY,Companionship with him meant cheerfulness. His horror of gloom and
335,A MEMORY,darkness was almost morbid. From the tragedies of life he instinctively
336,A MEMORY,"shrank, and large as was his sympathy, and generous and genuine his"
337,A MEMORY,"affection, he was often prompted to run from suffering and to betray"
338,A MEMORY,what must have been a constitutional terror of distress. He did not
339,A MEMORY,"hesitate to acknowledge this characteristic, and sought to atone for it"
340,A MEMORY,by writing the most tender and touching lines to those to whom he
341,A MEMORY,believed he owed a gift of comfort and strength. His private letters to
342,A MEMORY,friends in adversity or bereavement were beautiful in their simplicity
343,A MEMORY,"and honest and outspoken love, for he was not ashamed to let his friends"
344,A MEMORY,"see how much he thought of them. And even if the emotional quality,"
345,A MEMORY,"which asserts itself in the nervous and artistic temperament, made him"
346,A MEMORY,"realize that he could not trust himself, that same quality gave him a"
347,A MEMORY,personality marvelous in its magnetism. Both as boy and man he made
348,A MEMORY,"friends everywhere, and that he retained them to the last speaks for the"
349,A MEMORY,whole-heartedness and genuineness of his nature.
350,A MEMORY,
351,A MEMORY,To two weaknesses he frankly confessed: that he was inclined to be
352,A MEMORY,superstitious and that he was afraid of the dark. One of these he
353,A MEMORY,"stoutly defended, asserting that he who was not fearful in the dark was"
354,A MEMORY,"a dull clod, utterly devoid of imagination. From his earliest childhood"
355,A MEMORY,"my brother was a devourer of fairy tales, and he continually stored his"
356,A MEMORY,"mind with fantastic legends, which found a vent in new shapes in his"
357,A MEMORY,verses and prose tales. In the ceiling of one of his dens a trap-door
358,A MEMORY,"led into the attic, and as this door was open he seriously contemplated"
359,A MEMORY,"closing it, because, as he said, he fancied that queer things would come"
360,A MEMORY,down in the night and spirit him away. It is not to be inferred that he
361,A MEMORY,"thus remained in a condition of actual fear, but it is true that he was"
362,A MEMORY,"imaginative to the degree of acute nervousness, and, like a child,"
363,A MEMORY,associated light with safety and darkness with the uncanny and the
364,A MEMORY,"supernatural. It was after all the better for his songs that it was so,"
365,A MEMORY,else they might not have been filled with that cheery optimism which
366,A MEMORY,"praised the happiness of sunlight and warmth, and sought to lift"
367,A MEMORY,humanity from the darkness of despondency.
368,A MEMORY,
369,A MEMORY,"This weakness, or intellectual virtue as he pleasantly regarded it, was"
370,A MEMORY,perhaps rather stronger in him as a man than in his boyhood. He has
371,A MEMORY,"himself declared that he wrote ""Seein' Things at Night"" more to solace"
372,A MEMORY,"his own feelings than to delineate the sufferings of childhood, however"
373,A MEMORY,"aptly it may describe them. And when he put into rhythm that ""any color,"
374,A MEMORY,"so long as it's red, is the color that suits me best,"" he spoke not only"
375,A MEMORY,"as a poet but as a man, for red conveyed to him the idea of warmth and"
376,A MEMORY,"cheeriness, and seemed to express to him in color his temperamental"
377,A MEMORY,demand. All through his life he pandered to these feelings instead of
378,A MEMORY,"seeking to repress them, for to this extent there was little of the"
379,A MEMORY,"Puritan in his nature, and as he believed that happiness comes largely"
380,A MEMORY,"from within, so he felt that it is not un-Christian philosophy to avoid"
381,A MEMORY,as far as possible whatever may cloud and render less acceptable one's
382,A MEMORY,own existence.
383,A MEMORY,
384,A MEMORY,The literary talent of my brother is not easily traceable to either
385,A MEMORY,branch of the family. In fact it was tacitly accepted that he would be a
386,A MEMORY,"lawyer as his father and grandfather had been before him, but the"
387,A MEMORY,"futility of this arrangement was soon manifest, and surely no man less"
388,A MEMORY,temperamentally equipped for the law ever lived. It has been said of the
389,A MEMORY,"Fields, speaking generally of the New England division, that they were"
390,A MEMORY,"well adapted to be either musicians or actors, though the talent for"
391,A MEMORY,music or mimicry has been in no case carried out of private life save in
392,A MEMORY,my brother's public readings. Eugene had more than a boy's share of
393,A MEMORY,"musical talent, but he never cultivated it, preferring to use the fine"
394,A MEMORY,"voice with which he was endowed for recitation, of which he was always"
395,A MEMORY,fond. Acting was his strongest boyish passion. Even as a child he was a
396,A MEMORY,wonderful mimic and thereby the delight of his playmates and the terror
397,A MEMORY,of his teachers. He organized a stock company among the small boys of
398,A MEMORY,the village and gave performances in the barn of one of the less
399,A MEMORY,"scrupulous neighbors, but whether for pins or pennies memory does not"
400,A MEMORY,suggest. He assigned the parts and always reserved for himself the
401,A MEMORY,"eccentric character and the low comedy, caring nothing for the heroic or"
402,A MEMORY,the sentimental. One of the plays performed was Lester Wallack's
403,A MEMORY,"""Rosedale"" with Eugene in the dual role of the low comedian and the"
404,A MEMORY,"heavy villain. At this time also he delighted in monologues, imitations"
405,A MEMORY,"of eccentric types, or what Mr. Sol. Smith Russell calls ""comics,"" a"
406,A MEMORY,word which always amused Eugene and which he frequently used. This
407,A MEMORY,fondness for parlor readings and private theatricals he carried through
408,A MEMORY,"college, remaining steadfast to the ""comics"" until a few years ago,"
409,A MEMORY,"when he began to give public readings, and discovered that he was"
410,A MEMORY,capable of higher and more effective work. It was in fact his
411,A MEMORY,versatility that made him the most accomplished and the most popular
412,A MEMORY,author-entertainer in America. Before he went into journalism the more
413,A MEMORY,sedate of his family connections were in constant fear lest he should
414,A MEMORY,"adopt the profession of the actor, and he held it over them as a"
415,A MEMORY,"good-natured threat. On one occasion, failing to get a coveted"
416,A MEMORY,"appropriation from the executor of the estate, he said calmly to the"
417,A MEMORY,"worthy man: ""Very well. I must have money for my living expenses. If you"
418,A MEMORY,cannot advance it to me out of the estate I shall be compelled to go on
419,A MEMORY,the stage. But as I cannot keep my own name I have decided to assume
420,A MEMORY,"yours, and shall have lithographs struck off at once. They will read,"
421,A MEMORY,"'Tonight, M. L. Gray, Banjo and Specialty Artist.'"" The appropriation"
422,A MEMORY,was immediately forthcoming.
423,A MEMORY,
424,A MEMORY,It is in no sense depreciatory of my brother's attainments in life to
425,A MEMORY,say that he gave no evidence of precocity in his studies in childhood.
426,A MEMORY,"On the contrary he was somewhat slow in development, though this was due"
427,A MEMORY,not so much to a lack of natural ability--he learned easily and quickly
428,A MEMORY,when so disposed--as to a fondness for the hundred diversions which
429,A MEMORY,occupy a wide-awake boy's time. He possessed a marked talent for
430,A MEMORY,"caricature, and not a small part of the study hours was devoted to"
431,A MEMORY,"amusing pictures of his teachers, his playmates, and his pets. This"
432,A MEMORY,"habit of drawing, which was wholly without instruction, he always"
433,A MEMORY,"preserved, and it was his honest opinion, even at the height of his"
434,A MEMORY,"success in authorship, that he would have been much greater as a"
435,A MEMORY,caricaturist than as a writer. Until he was thirty years of age he wrote
436,A MEMORY,"a fair-sized legible hand, but about that time he adopted the"
437,A MEMORY,"microscopic penmanship which has been so widely reproduced, using for"
438,A MEMORY,the purpose very fine-pointed pens. With his manuscript he took the
439,A MEMORY,"greatest pains, often going to infinite trouble to illuminate his"
440,A MEMORY,letters. Among his friends these letters are held as curiosities of
441,A MEMORY,"literature, hardly more for the quaint sentiments expressed than for the"
442,A MEMORY,queer designs in colored inks which embellished them. He was specially
443,A MEMORY,"fond of drawing weird elves and gnomes, and would spend an hour or two"
444,A MEMORY,decorating with these comical figures a letter he had written in ten
445,A MEMORY,minutes. He was as fastidious with the manuscript for the office as if
446,A MEMORY,"it had been a specimen copy for exhibition, and it was always understood"
447,A MEMORY,that his manuscript should be returned to him after it had passed
448,A MEMORY,through the printers' hands. In this way all the original copies of his
449,A MEMORY,"stories and poems have been preserved, and those which he did not give"
450,A MEMORY,to friends as souvenirs have been bound for his children.
451,A MEMORY,
452,A MEMORY,"A taste for literary composition might not have passed, as doubtless it"
453,A MEMORY,"did pass, so many years unnoticed, had he been deficient in other"
454,A MEMORY,"talents, and had he devoted himself exclusively to writing. But as a boy"
455,A MEMORY,"he was fond, though in a less degree than many boys, of athletic sports,"
456,A MEMORY,"and his youthful desire for theatrical entertainments, pen caricaturing,"
457,A MEMORY,and dallying with his pets took up much of his time. Yet he often gave
458,A MEMORY,"way to a fondness for composition, and there is in the family"
459,A MEMORY,"possession a sermon which he wrote before he was ten years of age, in"
460,A MEMORY,which he showed the results of those arduous Sabbath days in the old
461,A MEMORY,"Congregational meeting-house. And at one time, when yet very young, he"
462,A MEMORY,"was at the head of a flourishing boys' paper, while at another, fresh"
463,A MEMORY,"from the inspiration of a blood-curdling romance in a New York Weekly,"
464,A MEMORY,"he prepared a series of tales of adventure which, unhappily, have not"
465,A MEMORY,been preserved. In his college days he was one of the associate editors
466,A MEMORY,"of the university magazine, and while at that time he had no serious"
467,A MEMORY,"thought of devoting his life to literature, his talents in that"
468,A MEMORY,"direction were freely confessed. From my father, whose studious habits"
469,A MEMORY,in life had made him not only eminent at the bar but profoundly
470,A MEMORY,"conversant with general literature, he had inherited a taste for"
471,A MEMORY,"reading, and it was this omnivorous passion for books that led my"
472,A MEMORY,brother to say that his education had only begun when he fancied that it
473,A MEMORY,had left off. In boyhood he contracted that fascinating but highly
474,A MEMORY,"injurious habit of reading in bed, which he subsequently extolled with"
475,A MEMORY,great fervor; and as he grew older the habit increased upon him until
476,A MEMORY,he was obliged to admit that he could not enjoy literature unless he
477,A MEMORY,"took it horizontally. If a friend expostulated with him, advising him to"
478,A MEMORY,"give up tobacco, reading in bed, and late hours, he said: ""And what have"
479,A MEMORY,"we left in life if we give up all our bad habits?"""
480,A MEMORY,
481,A MEMORY,That the poetic instinct was always strong within him there has never
482,A MEMORY,"been room to question, but, perhaps, for the reasons before assigned, it"
483,A MEMORY,was tardy in making its way outward. For years his mind lay fallow and
484,A MEMORY,"receptive, awaiting the occasion which should develop the true"
485,A MEMORY,"inspiration of the poet. He was accustomed to speak of himself, and too"
486,A MEMORY,"modestly, as merely a versifier, but his own experience should have"
487,A MEMORY,"contradicted this estimate, for his first efforts at verse were"
488,A MEMORY,"singularly halting in mechanical construction, and he was well past his"
489,A MEMORY,twenty-fifth year before he gave to the world any verse worthy the name.
490,A MEMORY,"What might be called the ""curse of comedy"" was on him, and it was not"
491,A MEMORY,until he threw off that yoke and gave expression to the better and the
492,A MEMORY,"sweeter thoughts within him that, as with Bion, ""the voice of song"
493,A MEMORY,"flowed freely from the heart."" It seems strange that a man who became a"
494,A MEMORY,master of the art of mechanism in verse should have been deficient in
495,A MEMORY,"this particular at a period comparatively late, but it merely"
496,A MEMORY,illustrates the theory of gradual development and marks the phases of
497,A MEMORY,"life through which, with his character of many sides, he was compelled"
498,A MEMORY,"to pass. He was nearly thirty when he wrote ""Christmas Treasures,"" the"
499,A MEMORY,"first poem he deemed worthy, and very properly, of preservation, and the"
500,A MEMORY,publication of this tender commemoration of the death of a child opened
501,A MEMORY,the springs of sentiment and love for childhood destined never to run
502,A MEMORY,dry while life endured.
503,A MEMORY,
504,A MEMORY,"In journalism he became immediately successful, not so much for"
505,A MEMORY,adaptability to the treadmill of that calling as for the brightness and
506,A MEMORY,distinctive character of his writing. He easily established a reputation
507,A MEMORY,"as a humorist, and while he fairly deserved the title he often regretted"
508,A MEMORY,that he could not entirely shake it off. His powers of perception were
509,A MEMORY,"phenomenally keen, and he detected the peculiarities of people with"
510,A MEMORY,"whom he was thrown in contact almost at a glance, while his gift of"
511,A MEMORY,mimicry was such that after a minute's interview he could burlesque the
512,A MEMORY,"victim to the life, even emphasizing the small details which had been"
513,A MEMORY,apparently too minute to attract the special notice of those who were
514,A MEMORY,acquaintances of years' standing. This faculty he carried into his
515,A MEMORY,"writing, and it proved immensely valuable, for, with his quick"
516,A MEMORY,appreciation of the ludicrous and his power of delineating personal
517,A MEMORY,peculiarities his sketches were remarkable for their resemblances even
518,A MEMORY,when he was indulging apparently in the wildest flights of imagination.
519,A MEMORY,"It is to be regretted that much of his newspaper work, covering a period"
520,A MEMORY,"of twenty years, was necessarily so full of purely local color that its"
521,A MEMORY,brilliancy could not be generally appreciated. For it is as if an artist
522,A MEMORY,"had painted a wondrous picture, clever enough in the general view, but"
523,A MEMORY,full of a significance hidden to the world.
524,A MEMORY,
525,A MEMORY,Equally facile was he in the way of adaptation. He could write a hoax
526,A MEMORY,"worthy of Poe, and one of his humors of imagination was sufficiently"
527,A MEMORY,"subtle and successful to excite comment in Europe and America, and to"
528,A MEMORY,call for an explanation and denial from a distinguished Englishman. He
529,A MEMORY,lived in Denver only a few weeks when he was writing verse in miners'
530,A MEMORY,dialect which has been rightly placed at the head of that style of
531,A MEMORY,"composition. No matter where he wandered, he speedily became imbued with"
532,A MEMORY,"the spirit of his surroundings, and his quickly and accurately gathered"
533,A MEMORY,"impressions found vent in his pen, whether he was in ""St. Martin's Lane"""
534,A MEMORY,"in London, with ""Mynheer Von Der Bloom"" in Amsterdam, or on the"
535,A MEMORY,"""Schnellest Zug"" from Hanover to Leipzig."
536,A MEMORY,
537,A MEMORY,"At the time of my brother's arrival in Chicago, in 1883--he was then in"
538,A MEMORY,his thirty-fourth year--he had performed an immense amount of newspaper
539,A MEMORY,"work, but had done little or nothing of permanent value or with any real"
540,A MEMORY,literary significance. But despite the fact that he had lived up to that
541,A MEMORY,time in the smaller cities he had a large number of acquaintances and a
542,A MEMORY,"certain following in the journalistic and artistic world, of which from"
543,A MEMORY,the very moment of his entrance into journalism he never had been
544,A MEMORY,"deprived. His immense fund of good humor, his powers as a story-teller,"
545,A MEMORY,"his admirable equipment as an entertainer, and the wholehearted way with"
546,A MEMORY,which he threw himself into life and the pleasures of living attracted
547,A MEMORY,men to him and kept him the centre of the multitude that prized his
548,A MEMORY,fascinating companionship. His fellows in journalism furthermore had
549,A MEMORY,"been quick to recognize his talents, and no man was more widely"
550,A MEMORY,"""copied,"" as the technical expression goes. His early years in Chicago"
551,A MEMORY,"did not differ materially from those of the previous decade, but the"
552,A MEMORY,enlarged scope gave greater play to his fancy and more opportunity for
553,A MEMORY,"his talents as a master of satire. The publication of ""The Denver"
554,A MEMORY,"Primer"" and ""Culture's Garland,"" while adding to his reputation as a"
555,A MEMORY,"humorist, happily did not satisfy him. He was now past the age of"
556,A MEMORY,"thirty-five, and a great psychical revolution was coming on. Though"
557,A MEMORY,"still on the sunny side of middle life, he was wearying of the cup of"
558,A MEMORY,"pleasure he had drunk so joyously, and was drawing away from the"
559,A MEMORY,multitude and toward the companionship of those who loved books and
560,A MEMORY,"bookish things, and who could sympathize with him in the aspirations for"
561,A MEMORY,"the better work, the consciousness of which had dawned. It was now that"
562,A MEMORY,he began to apply himself diligently to the preparation for higher
563,A MEMORY,"effort, and it is to the credit of journalism, which has so many sins to"
564,A MEMORY,"answer for, that in this he was encouraged beyond the usual fate of men"
565,A MEMORY,"who become slaves to that calling. And yet, though from this time he was"
566,A MEMORY,privileged to be regarded one of the sweetest singers in American
567,A MEMORY,"literature, and incomparably the noblest bard of childhood, though the"
568,A MEMORY,"grind of journalism was measurably taken from him, he chafed under the"
569,A MEMORY,conviction that he was condemned to mingle the prosaic and the practical
570,A MEMORY,"with the fanciful and the ideal, and that, having given hostages to"
571,A MEMORY,"fortune, he must conform even in a measure to the requirements of a"
572,A MEMORY,position too lucrative to be cast aside. From this time also his
573,A MEMORY,"physical condition, which never had been robust, began to show the"
574,A MEMORY,"effects of sedentary life, but the warning of a long siege of nervous"
575,A MEMORY,"dyspepsia was suffered to pass unheeded, and for five or six years he"
576,A MEMORY,"labored prodigiously, his mind expanding and his intellect growing more"
577,A MEMORY,brilliant as the vital powers decayed.
578,A MEMORY,
579,A MEMORY,It would seem that with the awakening of the consciousness of the better
580,A MEMORY,"powers within him, with the realization that he was destined for a place"
581,A MEMORY,"in literature, my brother felt a quasi remorse for the years he fancied"
582,A MEMORY,he had wasted. He was too severe with himself to understand that his
583,A MEMORY,"comparative tardiness in arriving at the earnest, thoughtful stage of"
584,A MEMORY,lifework was the inexorable law of gradual development which must govern
585,A MEMORY,"the career of a man of his temperament, with his exuberant vitality and"
586,A MEMORY,"his showy talents. It was a serious mistake, but it was not the less a"
587,A MEMORY,noble one. And now also the influences of home crept a little closer
588,A MEMORY,into his heart. His family life had not been without its tragedies of
589,A MEMORY,"bereavement, and the death of his oldest boy in Germany had drawn him"
590,A MEMORY,even nearer to the children who were growing up around him.
591,A MEMORY,
592,A MEMORY,"Much of his tenderest verse was inspired by affection for his family,"
593,A MEMORY,and as some great shock is often essential to the revolution in a
594,A MEMORY,"buoyant nature, so it seemed to require the oft-recurring tragedies of"
595,A MEMORY,life to draw from him all that was noblest and sweetest in his
596,A MEMORY,sympathetic soul. Had the angel of death never hovered over the crib in
597,A MEMORY,"my brother's home, had he never known the pangs and the heart-hunger"
598,A MEMORY,which come when the little voice is stilled and the little chair is
599,A MEMORY,"empty, he could not have written the lines which voice the great cry of"
600,A MEMORY,humanity and the hope of reunion in immortality beyond the grave.
601,A MEMORY,
602,A MEMORY,The flood of appeals for platform readings from cities and towns in all
603,A MEMORY,parts of the United States came too late for his physical strength and
604,A MEMORY,his ambition. Earlier in life he would have delighted in this form of
605,A MEMORY,"travel and entertainment, but his nature had wonderfully changed, and,"
606,A MEMORY,"strong as were the financial inducements, he was loath to leave his"
607,A MEMORY,"family and circle of intimate friends, and the home he had just"
608,A MEMORY,acquired. All of the time which he allotted for recreation he devoted
609,A MEMORY,"to working around his grounds, in arranging and rearranging his large"
610,A MEMORY,"library, and in the disposition of his curios. For years he had been an"
611,A MEMORY,"indefatigable collector, and he took a boyish pleasure not only in his"
612,A MEMORY,"souvenirs of long journeys and distinguished men and women, but in the"
613,A MEMORY,queer toys and trinkets of children which seemed to give him inspiration
614,A MEMORY,for much that was effective in childhood verse. To the careless observer
615,A MEMORY,the immense array of weird dolls and absurd toys in his working-room
616,A MEMORY,"meant little more than an idiosyncratic passion for the anomalous, but"
617,A MEMORY,those who were near to him knew what a connecting link they were between
618,A MEMORY,"him and the little children of whom he wrote, and how each trumpet and"
619,A MEMORY,"drum, each ""spinster doll,"" each little toy dog, each little tin"
620,A MEMORY,"soldier, played its part in the poems he sent out into the world. No"
621,A MEMORY,writer ever made more persistent and consistent use of the material by
622,A MEMORY,"which he was surrounded, or put a higher literary value on the little"
623,A MEMORY,things which go to make up the sum of human existence.
624,A MEMORY,
625,A MEMORY,Of the spiritual development of my brother much might be said in
626,A MEMORY,conviction and in tenderness. He was not a man who discussed religion
627,A MEMORY,"freely; he was associated with no religious denomination, and he"
628,A MEMORY,professed no creed beyond the brotherhood of mankind and the infinitude
629,A MEMORY,of God's love and mercy. In childhood he had been reared in much of the
630,A MEMORY,austerity of the Puritan doctrine of the relation of this life to the
631,A MEMORY,"hereafter, and much of the hardness and severity of Christianity, as"
632,A MEMORY,"still interpreted in many parts of New England, was forced upon him. As"
633,A MEMORY,"is not unusual in such cases, he rebelled against this conception of"
634,A MEMORY,"God and God's day, even while he confessed the intellectual advantages"
635,A MEMORY,"he had reaped from frequent compulsory communion with the Bible, and he"
636,A MEMORY,many times declared that his children should not be brought up to
637,A MEMORY,regard religion and the Sabbath as a bugbear. What evolution was going
638,A MEMORY,on in his mind at the turning point in his life who can say? Who shall
639,A MEMORY,look into the silent soul of the poet and see the hope and confidence
640,A MEMORY,and joy that have come from out the chaos of strife and doubt? Yet who
641,A MEMORY,"can read the verses, telling over and over the beautiful story of"
642,A MEMORY,"Bethlehem, the glory of the Christ-child and the comfort that comes"
643,A MEMORY,"from the Teacher, and doubt that in those moments he walked in the"
644,A MEMORY,light of the love of God?
645,A MEMORY,
646,A MEMORY,It is true that no man living in a Christian nation who is stirred by
647,A MEMORY,poetic instinct can fail to recognize and pay homage to that story of
648,A MEMORY,"wonderful sweetness, the coming of the Christ-child for the redemption"
649,A MEMORY,of the world. It is true that in commemoration the poet may speak while
650,A MEMORY,the man within is silent. But it is hardly true that he whose generous
651,A MEMORY,"soul responded to every principle of Christ, the Teacher, pleading for"
652,A MEMORY,"humanity, would sing over and over that tender song of love and"
653,A MEMORY,sacrifice as a mere poetic inspiration. As he slept my brother's soul
654,A MEMORY,was called. Who shall say that it was not summoned by that same angel
655,A MEMORY,"song that awakened ""Little Boy Blue""? Who shall doubt that the smile of"
656,A MEMORY,supreme peace and rest which lingered on his face after that noble
657,A MEMORY,"spirit had departed spoke for the victory he had won, for the hope and"
658,A MEMORY,"belief that had been justified, and for the happiness he had gained?"
659,A MEMORY,
660,A MEMORY,"To have been with my brother in the last year of his life, to have"
661,A MEMORY,seen the sweetening of a character already lovable to an unusual
662,A MEMORY,"degree, to know now that in his unconscious preparation for the life"
663,A MEMORY,"beyond he was drawing closer to those he loved and who loved him, this"
664,A MEMORY,"is the tenderest memory, the most precious heritage. Not to have seen"
665,A MEMORY,"him in that year is never to realize the full beauty of his nature, the"
666,A MEMORY,"complete development of his nobler self, the perfect abandonment of all"
667,A MEMORY,that might have been ungenerous and intemperate in one even less
668,A MEMORY,conscious of the weakness of mortality. He would say when chided for
669,A MEMORY,"public expression of kind words to those not wholly deserving, that he"
670,A MEMORY,"had felt the sting of harshness and ungraciousness, and never again"
671,A MEMORY,would he use his power to inflict suffering or wound the feelings of
672,A MEMORY,"man or child. Who is there to wonder, then, that the love of all went"
673,A MEMORY,"out to him, and that the other triumphs of his life were as nothing in"
674,A MEMORY,comparison with the grasp he maintained on popular affection? The day
675,A MEMORY,after his death a lady was purchasing flowers to send in sympathy for
676,A MEMORY,"the mourning family, when she was approached by a poorly-clad little"
677,A MEMORY,girl who timidly asked what she was going to do with so many roses.
678,A MEMORY,"When she replied that she intended sending them to Mr. Field, the"
679,A MEMORY,"little one said that she wanted so much to send Mr. Field a rose,"
680,A MEMORY,adding pathetically that she had no money. Deeply touched by the
681,A MEMORY,child's sorrowful earnestness the lady picked out a yellow rose and
682,A MEMORY,"gave it to her, and when the coffin was lowered to the grave a wealth"
683,A MEMORY,"of wreaths and designs was strewn around to mark the spot, but down"
684,A MEMORY,"below the hand of the silent poet held only a little yellow rose, the"
685,A MEMORY,"tribute of a child who did not know him in life, but in whose heart"
686,A MEMORY,nestled the love his songs had awakened and the magnetism of his great
687,A MEMORY,humanity had stirred.
688,A MEMORY,
689,A MEMORY,A few hours after his spirit had gone a crippled boy came to the house
690,A MEMORY,"and begged permission to go to the chamber. The wish was granted, and"
691,A MEMORY,"the boy hobbled to the bedside. Who he was, and in what manner my"
692,A MEMORY,"brother had befriended him, none of the family knew, but as he painfully"
693,A MEMORY,"picked his way down stairs the tears were streaming over his face, and"
694,A MEMORY,the onlookers forgot their own sorrow in contemplation of his grief.
695,A MEMORY,"The morning of the funeral, while the family stood around the coffin,"
696,A MEMORY,"the letter-carrier at Buena Park came into the room, and laying a bunch"
697,A MEMORY,"of letters at the foot of the bier said reverently: ""There is your last"
698,A MEMORY,"mail, Mr. Field."" Then turning with tears in his eyes, as if apologizing"
699,A MEMORY,"for an intrusion, he added: ""He was always good to me and I loved him."""
700,A MEMORY,
701,A MEMORY,It was this affection of those in humbler life that seems to speak the
702,A MEMORY,more eloquently for the beneficence and the triumph of his life's work.
703,A MEMORY,"No funeral could have been less ostentatious, yet none could have been"
704,A MEMORY,"more impressive in the multitude that overflowed the church, or more"
705,A MEMORY,conformable to his tenacious belief in the democracy of man. People of
706,A MEMORY,"eminence, of wealth, of fashion, were there, but they were swallowed up"
707,A MEMORY,in the great congregation of those to whom we are bound by the ties of
708,A MEMORY,"humanity and universal brotherhood, whose tears as they passed the bier"
709,A MEMORY,of the dead singer were the earnest and the best tribute to him who sang
710,A MEMORY,for all. What greater blessing hath man than this? What stronger
711,A MEMORY,assurance can there be of happiness in that life where all is weighed
712,A MEMORY,"in the scale of love, and where love is triumphant and eternal?"
713,A MEMORY,
714,A MEMORY,"Sleep, my brother, in the perfect joy of an awakening to that happiness"

716,A MEMORY,loved you will always cherish the memory of that love as the tender
717,A MEMORY,inspiration of your gentle spirit. Sleep and dream that the songs you
718,A MEMORY,sang will still be sung when those who sing them now are sleeping with

720,A MEMORY,"your last ""Good-Night"" lengthened into eternity. And if the Horace you"

821,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,
822,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"Oh, them days on Red Hoss Mountain, when the skies wuz fair 'nd blue,"
823,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"When the money flowed like likker, 'nd the  folks wuz brave 'nd true!"
824,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"When the nights wuz crisp 'nd balmy, 'nd  the camp wuz all astir,"
825,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,With the joints all throwed wide open 'nd no sheriff to demur!
826,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"Oh, them times on Red Hoss Mountain in the Rockies fur away,--"
827,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,There's no sich place nor times like them as I kin find to-day!
828,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,What though the camp _hez_ busted? I seem to see it still
829,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"A-lyin', like it loved it, on that big 'nd warty hill;"
830,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,And I feel a sort of yearnin' 'nd a chokin' in my throat
831,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,When I think of Red Hoss Mountain 'nd of Casey's tabble dote!
832,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,
833,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"Wal, yes; it's true I struck it rich, but that don't cut a show"
834,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,When one is old 'nd feeble 'nd it's nigh his time to go;
835,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,The money that he's got in bonds or carries to invest
836,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,Don't figger with a codger who has lived a life out West;
837,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"Us old chaps like to set around, away from folks 'nd noise,"
838,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,'Nd think about the sights we seen and things we done when boys;
839,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,The which is why _I_ love to set 'nd think of them old days
840,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"When all us Western fellers got the Colorado craze,--"
841,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,And _that_ is why I love to set around all day 'nd gloat
842,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,On thoughts of Red Hoss Mountain 'nd of Casey's tabble dote.
843,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,
844,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"This Casey wuz an Irishman,--you'd know it by his name"
845,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,And by the facial features appertainin' to the same.
846,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"He'd lived in many places 'nd had done a thousand things,"
847,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"From the noble art of actin' to the work of dealin' kings,"
848,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"But, somehow, hadn't caught on; so, driftin' with the rest,"
849,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"He drifted for a fortune to the undeveloped West,"
850,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"And he come to Red Hoss Mountain when the little camp wuz new,"
851,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"When the money flowed like likker, 'nd the folks wuz brave 'nd true;"
852,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"And, havin' been a stewart on a Mississippi boat,"
853,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,He opened up a caffy 'nd he run a tabble dote.
854,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,
855,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"The bar wuz long 'nd rangy, with a mirrer on the shelf,"
856,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"'Nd a pistol, so that Casey, when required, could help himself;"
857,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"Down underneath there wuz a row of bottled beer 'nd wine,"
858,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,'Nd a kag of Burbun whiskey of the run of '59;
859,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"Upon the walls wuz pictures of hosses 'nd of girls,--"
860,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"Not much on dress, perhaps, but strong on records 'nd on curls!"
861,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"The which had been identified with Casey in the past,--"
862,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"The hosses 'nd the girls, I mean,--and both wuz mighty fast!"
863,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,But all these fine attractions wuz of precious little note
864,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,By the side of what wuz offered at Casey's tabble dote.
865,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,
866,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"There wuz half-a-dozen tables altogether in the place,"
867,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,And the tax you had to pay upon your vittles wuz a case;
868,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,The boardin'-houses in the camp protested 't wuz a shame
869,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"To patronize a robber, which this Casey wuz the same!"
870,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,They said a case was robbery to tax for ary meal;
871,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"But Casey tended strictly to his biz, 'nd let 'em squeal;"
872,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"And presently the boardin'-houses all began to bust,"
873,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,While Casey kept on sawin' wood 'nd layin' in the dust;
874,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,And oncet a tray'lin' editor from Denver City wrote
875,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"A piece back to his paper, puffin' Casey's tabble dote."
876,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,
877,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,A tabble dote is different from orderin' aller cart:
878,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"In _one_ case you git all there is, in _t' other_, only _part_!"
879,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"And Casey's tabble dote began in French,--as all begin,--"
880,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"And Casey's ended with the same, which is to say, with ""vin;"""
881,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"But in between wuz every kind of reptile, bird, 'nd beast,"
882,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,The same like you can git in high-toned restauraws down east;
883,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"'Nd windin' up wuz cake or pie, with coffee demy tass,"
884,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"Or, sometimes, floatin' Ireland in a soothin' kind of sass"
885,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"That left a sort of pleasant ticklin' in a feller's throat,"
886,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,'Nd made him hanker after more of Casey's tabble dote.
887,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,
888,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,The very recollection of them puddin's 'nd them pies
889,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,Brings a yearnin' to my buzzum 'nd the water to my eyes;
890,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,'Nd seems like cookin' nowadays ain't what it used to be
891,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,In camp on Red Hoss Mountain in that year of '63;
892,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"But, maybe, it is better, 'nd, maybe, I'm to blame--"
893,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,I'd like to be a-livin' in the mountains jest the same--
894,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"I'd like to live that life again when skies wuz fair 'nd blue,"
895,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,When things wuz run wide open 'nd men wuz brave 'nd true;
896,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,When brawny arms the flinty ribs of Red Hoss Mountain smote
897,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,For wherewithal to pay the price of Casey's tabble dote.
898,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,
899,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"And you, O cherished brother, a-sleepin' 'way out west,"
900,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"With Red Hoss Mountain huggin' you close to its lovin' breast,--"
901,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"Oh, do you dream in your last sleep of how we used to do,"
902,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"Of how we worked our little claims together, me 'nd you?"
903,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"Why, when I saw you last a smile wuz restin' on your face,"
904,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,Like you wuz glad to sleep forever in that lonely place;
905,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"And so you wuz, 'nd I 'd be, too, if I wuz sleepin' so."
906,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"But, bein' how a brother's love ain't for the world to know,"
907,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,"Whenever I've this heartache 'nd this chokin' in my throat,"
908,CASEY'S TABLE D'HÔTE,I lay it all to thinkin' of Casey's tabble dote.

916,LITTLE BOY BLUE,"The little toy dog is covered with dust,"
917,LITTLE BOY BLUE,But sturdy and stanch he stands;
918,LITTLE BOY BLUE,"And the little toy soldier is red with rust,"
919,LITTLE BOY BLUE,And his musket molds in his hands.
920,LITTLE BOY BLUE,Time was when the little toy dog was new
921,LITTLE BOY BLUE,"And the soldier was passing fair,"
922,LITTLE BOY BLUE,And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue
923,LITTLE BOY BLUE,Kissed them and put them there.
924,LITTLE BOY BLUE,
925,LITTLE BOY BLUE,"""Now, don't you go till I come,"" he said,"
926,LITTLE BOY BLUE,"""And don't you make any noise!"""
927,LITTLE BOY BLUE,So toddling off to his trundle-bed
928,LITTLE BOY BLUE,He dreamed of the pretty toys.
929,LITTLE BOY BLUE,"And as he was dreaming, an angel song"
930,LITTLE BOY BLUE,"Awakened our Little Boy Blue,--"
931,LITTLE BOY BLUE,"Oh, the years are many, the years are long,"
932,LITTLE BOY BLUE,But the little toy friends are true.
933,LITTLE BOY BLUE,
934,LITTLE BOY BLUE,"Ay, faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand,"
935,LITTLE BOY BLUE,"Each in the same old place,"
936,LITTLE BOY BLUE,"Awaiting the touch of a little hand,"
937,LITTLE BOY BLUE,The smile of a little face.
938,LITTLE BOY BLUE,"And they wonder, as waiting these long years through,"
939,LITTLE BOY BLUE,"In the dust of that little chair,"
940,LITTLE BOY BLUE,What has become of our Little Boy Blue
941,LITTLE BOY BLUE,Since he kissed them and put them there.

2278,OUR LADY OF THE MINE,"The which we did not take to be respectful to a lady,"

3345,DUTCH LULLABY,And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
3346,DUTCH LULLABY,Is a wee one's trundle-bed;
3347,DUTCH LULLABY,So shut your eyes while Mother sings
3348,DUTCH LULLABY,"Of wonderful sights that be,"
3349,DUTCH LULLABY,And you shall see the beautiful things

3775,THE CONVERSAZZHYONY,We all opined his treatment uv the girl deserved rebuke.
3776,THE CONVERSAZZHYONY,"It warn't no use for Sorry Tom to nail it for a lie,--"
3777,THE CONVERSAZZHYONY,"When it come to sassin' wimmin, there wuz blood in every eye;"
3778,THE CONVERSAZZHYONY,"The boom for Charlotte Rooze swep' on an' took the polls by storm,"
3779,THE CONVERSAZZHYONY,An' so Three-fingered Hoover fell a martyr to reform!
3780,THE CONVERSAZZHYONY,
3781,THE CONVERSAZZHYONY,"Three-fingered Hoover said it was a terrible mistake,"

3790,THE CONVERSAZZHYONY,How we vindicated all their sex a twenty year ago.
3791,THE CONVERSAZZHYONY,
3792,THE CONVERSAZZHYONY,"For in these wondrous twenty years has come a mighty change,"

4232,YVYTOT,
4233,YVYTOT,_Where wail the waters in their flaw
4234,YVYTOT,"A spectre wanders to and fro,"
4235,YVYTOT,And evermore that ghostly shore
4236,YVYTOT,Bemoans the heir of Yvytot_.
4237,YVYTOT,
4238,YVYTOT,"_Sometimes, when, like a fleecy pall,"
4239,YVYTOT,"The mists upon the waters fall,"
4240,YVYTOT,Across the main float shadows twain
4241,YVYTOT,That do not heed the spectre's call_.
4242,YVYTOT,
4243,YVYTOT,The king his son of Yvytot
4244,YVYTOT,Stood once and saw the waters go
4245,YVYTOT,Boiling around with hissing sound
4246,YVYTOT,The sullen phantom rocks below.
4247,YVYTOT,
4248,YVYTOT,And suddenly he saw a face
4249,YVYTOT,Lift from that black and seething place--
4250,YVYTOT,Lift up and gaze in mute amaze
4251,YVYTOT,"And tenderly a little space,"
4252,YVYTOT,
4253,YVYTOT,A mighty cry of love made he--
4254,YVYTOT,"No answering word to him gave she,"
4255,YVYTOT,"But looked, and then sunk back again"
4256,YVYTOT,Into the dark and depthless sea.
4257,YVYTOT,
4258,YVYTOT,"And ever afterward that face,"
4259,YVYTOT,"That he beheld such little space,"
4260,YVYTOT,Like wraith would rise within his eyes
4261,YVYTOT,And in his heart find biding place.
4262,YVYTOT,
4263,YVYTOT,So oft from castle hall he crept
4264,YVYTOT,"Where mid the rocks grim shadows slept,"
4265,YVYTOT,And where the mist reached down and kissed
4266,YVYTOT,The waters as they wailed and wept.
4267,YVYTOT,
4268,YVYTOT,The king it was of Yvytot
4269,YVYTOT,"That vaunted, many years ago,"
4270,YVYTOT,There was no coast his valiant host
4271,YVYTOT,Had not subdued with spear and bow.
4272,YVYTOT,
4273,YVYTOT,For once to him the sea-king cried:
4274,YVYTOT,"""In safety all thy ships shall ride"
4275,YVYTOT,An thou but swear thy princely heir
4276,YVYTOT,Shall take my daughter to his bride.
4277,YVYTOT,
4278,YVYTOT,"""And lo, these winds that rove the sea"
4279,YVYTOT,"Unto our pact shall witness be,"
4280,YVYTOT,And of the oath which binds us both
4281,YVYTOT,"Shall be the judge 'twixt me and thee!"""
4282,YVYTOT,
4283,YVYTOT,Then swore the king of Yvytot
4284,YVYTOT,"Unto the sea-king years ago,"
4285,YVYTOT,And with great cheer for many a year
4286,YVYTOT,His ships went harrying to and fro.
4287,YVYTOT,
4288,YVYTOT,Unto this mighty king his throne
4289,YVYTOT,"Was born a prince, and one alone--"
4290,YVYTOT,Fairer than he in form and blee
4291,YVYTOT,And knightly grace was never known.
4292,YVYTOT,
4293,YVYTOT,But once he saw a maiden face
4294,YVYTOT,Lift from a haunted ocean place--
4295,YVYTOT,Lift up and gaze in mute amaze
4296,YVYTOT,And tenderly a little space.
4297,YVYTOT,
4298,YVYTOT,"Wroth was the king of Yvytot,"
4299,YVYTOT,For that his son would never go
4300,YVYTOT,"Sailing the sea, but liefer be"
4301,YVYTOT,"Where wailed the waters in their flow,"
4302,YVYTOT,
4303,YVYTOT,"Where winds in clamorous anger swept,"
4304,YVYTOT,"Where to and fro grim shadows crept,"
4305,YVYTOT,And where the mist reached down and kissed
4306,YVYTOT,The waters as they wailed and wept.
4307,YVYTOT,
4308,YVYTOT,"So sped the years, till came a day"
4309,YVYTOT,"The haughty king was old and gray,"
4310,YVYTOT,And in his hold were spoils untold
4311,YVYTOT,That he had wrenched from Norroway.
4312,YVYTOT,
4313,YVYTOT,Then once again the sea-king cried:
4314,YVYTOT,"""Thy ships have harried far and wide;"
4315,YVYTOT,My part is done--now let thy son
4316,YVYTOT,"Require my daughter to his bride!"""
4317,YVYTOT,
4318,YVYTOT,"Loud laughed the king of Yvytot,"
4319,YVYTOT,And by his soul he bade him no--
4320,YVYTOT,"""I heed no more what oath I swore,"
4321,YVYTOT,"For I was mad to bargain so!"""
4322,YVYTOT,
4323,YVYTOT,Then spake the sea-king in his wrath:
4324,YVYTOT,"""Thy ships lie broken in my path!"
4325,YVYTOT,"Go now and wring thy hands, false king!"
4326,YVYTOT,Nor ship nor heir thy kingdom hath!
4327,YVYTOT,
4328,YVYTOT,"""And thou shalt wander evermore"
4329,YVYTOT,"All up and down this ghostly shore,"
4330,YVYTOT,And call in vain upon the twain
4331,YVYTOT,"That keep what oath a dastard swore!"""
4332,YVYTOT,
4333,YVYTOT,The king his son of Yvytot
4334,YVYTOT,Stood even then where to and fro
4335,YVYTOT,The breakers swelled--and there beheld
4336,YVYTOT,A maiden face lift from below.
4337,YVYTOT,
4338,YVYTOT,"""Be thou or truth or dream,"" he cried,"
4339,YVYTOT,"""Or spirit of the restless tide,"
4340,YVYTOT,"It booteth not to me, God wot!"
4341,YVYTOT,"But I would have thee to my bride."""
4342,YVYTOT,
4343,YVYTOT,"Then spake the maiden: ""Come with me"
4344,YVYTOT,"Unto a palace in the sea,"
4345,YVYTOT,For there my sire in kingly ire
4346,YVYTOT,"Requires thy king his oath of thee!"""
4347,YVYTOT,
4348,YVYTOT,Gayly he fared him down the sands
4349,YVYTOT,And took the maiden's outstretched hands;
4350,YVYTOT,And so went they upon their way
4351,YVYTOT,To do the sea-king his commands.
4352,YVYTOT,
4353,YVYTOT,The winds went riding to and fro
4354,YVYTOT,"And scourged the waves that crouched below,"
4355,YVYTOT,And bade them sing to a childless king
4356,YVYTOT,The bridal song of Yvytot.
4357,YVYTOT,
4358,YVYTOT,"So fell the curse upon that shore,"
4359,YVYTOT,And hopeless wailing evermore
4360,YVYTOT,Was the righteous dole of the craven soul
4361,YVYTOT,That heeded not what oath he swore.
4362,YVYTOT,
4363,YVYTOT,An hundred ships went down that day
4364,YVYTOT,"All off the coast of Norroway,"
4365,YVYTOT,And the ruthless sea made mighty glee
4366,YVYTOT,Over the spoil that drifting lay.
4367,YVYTOT,
4368,YVYTOT,The winds went calling far and wide
4369,YVYTOT,To the dead that tossed in the mocking tide:
4370,YVYTOT,"""Come forth, ye slaves! from your fleeting graves"
4371,YVYTOT,"And drink a health to your prince his bride!"""
4372,YVYTOT,
4373,YVYTOT,_Where wail the waters in their flow
4374,YVYTOT,"A spectre wanders to and fro,"
4375,YVYTOT,But nevermore that ghostly shore
4376,YVYTOT,Shall claim the heir of Yvytot_.
4377,YVYTOT,
4378,YVYTOT,"_Sometimes, when, like a fleecy pall,"
4379,YVYTOT,"The mists upon the waters fall,"
4380,YVYTOT,Across the main flit shadows twain
4381,YVYTOT,That do not heed the spectre's call_.

4386,LONG AGO,LONG AGO
4387,LONG AGO,
4388,LONG AGO,
4389,LONG AGO,I once knew all the birds that came
4390,LONG AGO,And nested in our orchard trees;
4391,LONG AGO,For every flower I had a name--
4392,LONG AGO,"My friends were woodchucks, toads, and bees;"
4393,LONG AGO,I knew where thrived in yonder glen
4394,LONG AGO,What plants would soothe a stone-bruised toe--
4395,LONG AGO,"Oh, I was very learned then;"
4396,LONG AGO,But that was very long ago!
4397,LONG AGO,
4398,LONG AGO,I knew the spot upon the hill
4399,LONG AGO,"Where checkerberries could be found,"
4400,LONG AGO,I knew the rushes near the mill
4401,LONG AGO,Where pickerel lay that weighed a pound!
4402,LONG AGO,"I knew the wood,--the very tree"
4403,LONG AGO,"Where lived the poaching, saucy crow,"
4404,LONG AGO,And all the woods and crows knew me--
4405,LONG AGO,But that was very long ago.
4406,LONG AGO,
4407,LONG AGO,"And pining for the joys of youth,"
4408,LONG AGO,I tread the old familiar spot
4409,LONG AGO,Only to learn this solemn truth:
4410,LONG AGO,"I have forgotten, am forgot."
4411,LONG AGO,Yet here's this youngster at my knee
4412,LONG AGO,Knows all the things I used to know;
4413,LONG AGO,To think I once was wise as he--
4414,LONG AGO,But that was very long ago.
4415,LONG AGO,
4416,LONG AGO,I know it's folly to complain
4417,LONG AGO,Of whatsoe'er the Fates decree;
4418,LONG AGO,"Yet were not wishes all in vain,"
4419,LONG AGO,I tell you what my wish should be:
4420,LONG AGO,"I'd wish to be a boy again,"
4421,LONG AGO,Back with the friends I used to know;
4422,LONG AGO,"For I was, oh! so happy then--"
4423,LONG AGO,But that was very long ago!

4431,TO A SOUBRETTE,"'Tis years, soubrette, since last we met;"
4432,TO A SOUBRETTE,"And yet--ah, yet, how swift and tender"
4433,TO A SOUBRETTE,My thoughts go back in time's dull track
4434,TO A SOUBRETTE,"To you, sweet pink of female gender!"
4435,TO A SOUBRETTE,I shall not say--though others may--
4436,TO A SOUBRETTE,That time all human joy enhances;
4437,TO A SOUBRETTE,But the same old thrill comes to me still
4438,TO A SOUBRETTE,With memories of your songs and dances.
4439,TO A SOUBRETTE,
4440,TO A SOUBRETTE,Soubrettish ways these latter days
4441,TO A SOUBRETTE,"Invite my praise, but never get it;"
4442,TO A SOUBRETTE,I still am true to yours and you--
4443,TO A SOUBRETTE,"My record's made, I'll not upset it!"
4444,TO A SOUBRETTE,"The pranks they play, the things they say--"
4445,TO A SOUBRETTE,"I'd blush to put the like on paper,"
4446,TO A SOUBRETTE,And I'll avow they don't know how
4447,TO A SOUBRETTE,"To dance, so awkwardly they caper!"
4448,TO A SOUBRETTE,
4449,TO A SOUBRETTE,I used to sit down in the pit
4450,TO A SOUBRETTE,And see you flit like elf or fairy
4451,TO A SOUBRETTE,"Across the stage, and I'll engage"
4452,TO A SOUBRETTE,No moonbeam sprite was half so airy;
4453,TO A SOUBRETTE,"Lo, everywhere about me there"
4454,TO A SOUBRETTE,"Were rivals reeking with pomatum,"
4455,TO A SOUBRETTE,"And if, perchance, they caught your glance"
4456,TO A SOUBRETTE,"In song or dance, how did I hate 'em!"
4457,TO A SOUBRETTE,
4458,TO A SOUBRETTE,At half-past ten came rapture--then
4459,TO A SOUBRETTE,"Of all those men was I most happy,"
4460,TO A SOUBRETTE,For bottled beer and royal cheer
4461,TO A SOUBRETTE,And têtes-à-têtes were on the tapis.
4462,TO A SOUBRETTE,"Do you forget, my fair soubrette,"
4463,TO A SOUBRETTE,"Those suppers at the Cafe Rector,--"
4464,TO A SOUBRETTE,The cosey nook where we partook
4465,TO A SOUBRETTE,Of sweeter cheer than fabled nectar?
4466,TO A SOUBRETTE,
4467,TO A SOUBRETTE,"Oh, happy days, when youth's wild ways"
4468,TO A SOUBRETTE,Knew every phase of harmless folly!
4469,TO A SOUBRETTE,"Oh, blissful nights, whose fierce delights"
4470,TO A SOUBRETTE,Defied gaunt-featured Melancholy!
4471,TO A SOUBRETTE,"Gone are they all beyond recall,"
4472,TO A SOUBRETTE,"And I--a shade, a mere reflection--"
4473,TO A SOUBRETTE,Am forced to feed my spirit's greed
4474,TO A SOUBRETTE,Upon the husks of retrospection!
4475,TO A SOUBRETTE,
4476,TO A SOUBRETTE,"And lo! to-night, the phantom light,"
4477,TO A SOUBRETTE,"That, as a sprite, flits on the fender,"
4478,TO A SOUBRETTE,Reveals a face whose girlish grace
4479,TO A SOUBRETTE,"Brings back the feeling, warm and tender;"
4480,TO A SOUBRETTE,"And, all the while, the old-time smile"
4481,TO A SOUBRETTE,"Plays on my visage, grim and wrinkled,--"
4482,TO A SOUBRETTE,"As though, soubrette, your footfalls yet"
4483,TO A SOUBRETTE,Upon my rusty heart-strings tinkled!
