158,CHAPTER I,
159,CHAPTER I,
160,CHAPTER I,"It has been my lot to have had my name introduced both in conversation,"
161,CHAPTER I,"and in print, more frequently than I find it easy to explain, whether"
162,CHAPTER I,"I consider the fewness, unimportance, and limited circulation of my"
163,CHAPTER I,"writings, or the retirement and distance, in which I have lived, both"
164,CHAPTER I,from the literary and political world. Most often it has been connected
165,CHAPTER I,"with some charge which I could not acknowledge, or some principle which"
166,CHAPTER I,"I had never entertained. Nevertheless, had I had no other motive"
167,CHAPTER I,"or incitement, the reader would not have been troubled with this"
168,CHAPTER I,"exculpation. What my additional purposes were, will be seen in the"
169,CHAPTER I,"following pages. It will be found, that the least of what I have written"
170,CHAPTER I,concerns myself personally. I have used the narration chiefly for the
171,CHAPTER I,"purpose of giving a continuity to the work, in part for the sake of"
172,CHAPTER I,"the miscellaneous reflections suggested to me by particular events, but"
173,CHAPTER I,"still more as introductory to a statement of my principles in Politics,"
174,CHAPTER I,"Religion, and Philosophy, and an application of the rules, deduced from"
175,CHAPTER I,"philosophical principles, to poetry and criticism. But of the objects,"
176,CHAPTER I,"which I proposed to myself, it was not the least important to effect,"
177,CHAPTER I,"as far as possible, a settlement of the long continued controversy"
178,CHAPTER I,concerning the true nature of poetic diction; and at the same time to
179,CHAPTER I,define with the utmost impartiality the real poetic character of the
180,CHAPTER I,"poet, by whose writings this controversy was first kindled, and has been"
181,CHAPTER I,since fuelled and fanned.
182,CHAPTER I,
183,CHAPTER I,"In the spring of 1796, when I had but little passed the verge of"
184,CHAPTER I,"manhood, I published a small volume of juvenile poems. They were"
185,CHAPTER I,"received with a degree of favour, which, young as I was, I well know"
186,CHAPTER I,"was bestowed on them not so much for any positive merit, as because they"
187,CHAPTER I,"were considered buds of hope, and promises of better works to come. The"
188,CHAPTER I,"critics of that day, the most flattering, equally with the severest,"
189,CHAPTER I,"concurred in objecting to them obscurity, a general turgidness of"
190,CHAPTER I,"diction, and a profusion of new coined double epithets [1]. The first"
191,CHAPTER I,is the fault which a writer is the least able to detect in his own
192,CHAPTER I,compositions: and my mind was not then sufficiently disciplined to
193,CHAPTER I,"receive the authority of others, as a substitute for my own conviction."
194,CHAPTER I,"Satisfied that the thoughts, such as they were, could not have been"
195,CHAPTER I,"expressed otherwise, or at least more perspicuously, I forgot to"
196,CHAPTER I,"inquire, whether the thoughts themselves did not demand a degree of"
197,CHAPTER I,attention unsuitable to the nature and objects of poetry. This remark
198,CHAPTER I,"however applies chiefly, though not exclusively, to the Religious"
199,CHAPTER I,"Musings. The remainder of the charge I admitted to its full extent,"
200,CHAPTER I,and not without sincere acknowledgments both to my private and public
201,CHAPTER I,"censors for their friendly admonitions. In the after editions, I pruned"
202,CHAPTER I,"the double epithets with no sparing hand, and used my best efforts to"
203,CHAPTER I,"tame the swell and glitter both of thought and diction; though in truth,"
204,CHAPTER I,these parasite plants of youthful poetry had insinuated themselves into
205,CHAPTER I,"my longer poems with such intricacy of union, that I was often obliged"
206,CHAPTER I,"to omit disentangling the weed, from the fear of snapping the flower."
207,CHAPTER I,From that period to the date of the present work I have published
208,CHAPTER I,"nothing, with my name, which could by any possibility have come before"
209,CHAPTER I,"the board of anonymous criticism. Even the three or four poems, printed"
210,CHAPTER I,"with the works of a friend [2], as far as they were censured at all,"
211,CHAPTER I,"were charged with the same or similar defects, (though I am persuaded"
212,CHAPTER I,"not with equal justice),--with an excess of ornament, in addition to"
213,CHAPTER I,"strained and elaborate diction. I must be permitted to add, that,"
214,CHAPTER I,"even at the early period of my juvenile poems, I saw and admitted the"
215,CHAPTER I,"superiority of an austerer and more natural style, with an insight not"
216,CHAPTER I,"less clear, than I at present possess. My judgment was stronger than"
217,CHAPTER I,"were my powers of realizing its dictates; and the faults of my language,"
218,CHAPTER I,"though indeed partly owing to a wrong choice of subjects, and the desire"
219,CHAPTER I,"of giving a poetic colouring to abstract and metaphysical truths,"
220,CHAPTER I,"in which a new world then seemed to open upon me, did yet, in part"
221,CHAPTER I,"likewise, originate in unfeigned diffidence of my own comparative"
222,CHAPTER I,"talent.--During several years of my youth and early manhood, I"
223,CHAPTER I,reverenced those who had re-introduced the manly simplicity of the
224,CHAPTER I,"Greek, and of our own elder poets, with such enthusiasm as made the hope"
225,CHAPTER I,seem presumptuous of writing successfully in the same style. Perhaps
226,CHAPTER I,a similar process has happened to others; but my earliest poems were
227,CHAPTER I,"marked by an ease and simplicity, which I have studied, perhaps with"
228,CHAPTER I,"inferior success, to impress on my later compositions."
229,CHAPTER I,
230,CHAPTER I,"At school, (Christ’s Hospital,) I enjoyed the inestimable advantage of"
231,CHAPTER I,"a very sensible, though at the same time, a very severe master, the"
232,CHAPTER I,Reverend James Bowyer. He early moulded my taste to the preference of
233,CHAPTER I,"Demosthenes to Cicero, of Homer and Theocritus to Virgil, and again of"
234,CHAPTER I,"Virgil to Ovid. He habituated me to compare Lucretius, (in such extracts"
235,CHAPTER I,"as I then read,) Terence, and above all the chaster poems of Catullus,"
236,CHAPTER I,"not only with the Roman poets of the, so called, silver and brazen ages;"
237,CHAPTER I,but with even those of the Augustan aera: and on grounds of plain sense
238,CHAPTER I,and universal logic to see and assert the superiority of the former in
239,CHAPTER I,the truth and nativeness both of their thoughts and diction. At the
240,CHAPTER I,"same time that we were studying the Greek tragic poets, he made us read"
241,CHAPTER I,"Shakespeare and Milton as lessons: and they were the lessons too, which"
242,CHAPTER I,"required most time and trouble to bring up, so as to escape his"
243,CHAPTER I,"censure. I learned from him, that poetry, even that of the loftiest and,"
244,CHAPTER I,"seemingly, that of the wildest odes, had a logic of its own, as severe"
245,CHAPTER I,"as that of science; and more difficult, because more subtle, more"
246,CHAPTER I,"complex, and dependent on more, and more fugitive causes. In the truly"
247,CHAPTER I,"great poets, he would say, there is a reason assignable, not only for"
248,CHAPTER I,"every word, but for the position of every word; and I well remember"
249,CHAPTER I,"that, availing himself of the synonymes to the Homer of Didymus, he made"
250,CHAPTER I,"us attempt to show, with regard to each, why it would not have answered"
251,CHAPTER I,the same purpose; and wherein consisted the peculiar fitness of the word
252,CHAPTER I,in the original text.
253,CHAPTER I,
254,CHAPTER I,"In our own English compositions, (at least for the last three years of"
255,CHAPTER I,"our school education,) he showed no mercy to phrase, metaphor, or image,"
256,CHAPTER I,"unsupported by a sound sense, or where the same sense might have been"
257,CHAPTER I,"conveyed with equal force and dignity in plainer words [3]. Lute,"
258,CHAPTER I,"harp, and lyre, Muse, Muses, and inspirations, Pegasus, Parnassus, and"
259,CHAPTER I,Hippocrene were all an abomination to him. In fancy I can almost hear
260,CHAPTER I,"him now, exclaiming “Harp? Harp? Lyre? Pen and ink, boy, you mean! Muse,"
261,CHAPTER I,"boy, Muse? Your nurse’s daughter, you mean! Pierian spring? Oh aye!"
262,CHAPTER I,"the cloister-pump, I suppose!” Nay certain introductions, similes,"
263,CHAPTER I,"and examples, were placed by name on a list of interdiction. Among the"
264,CHAPTER I,"similes, there was, I remember, that of the manchineel fruit, as suiting"
265,CHAPTER I,equally well with too many subjects; in which however it yielded the
266,CHAPTER I,"palm at once to the example of Alexander and Clytus, which"
267,CHAPTER I,"was equally good and apt, whatever might be the theme. Was"
268,CHAPTER I,it ambition? Alexander and Clytus!--Flattery? Alexander and
269,CHAPTER I,Clytus!--anger--drunkenness--pride--friendship--ingratitude--late
270,CHAPTER I,"repentance? Still, still Alexander and Clytus! At length, the praises of"
271,CHAPTER I,"agriculture having been exemplified in the sagacious observation that,"
272,CHAPTER I,"had Alexander been holding the plough, he would not have run his friend"
273,CHAPTER I,"Clytus through with a spear, this tried, and serviceable old friend"
274,CHAPTER I,was banished by public edict in saecula saeculorum. I have sometimes
275,CHAPTER I,"ventured to think, that a list of this kind, or an index expurgatorius"
276,CHAPTER I,"of certain well-known and ever-returning phrases, both introductory,"
277,CHAPTER I,"and transitional, including a large assortment of modest egoisms, and"
278,CHAPTER I,"flattering illeisms, and the like, might be hung up in our Law-courts,"
279,CHAPTER I,"and both Houses of Parliament, with great advantage to the public, as"
280,CHAPTER I,"an important saving of national time, an incalculable relief to his"
281,CHAPTER I,"Majesty’s ministers, but above all, as insuring the thanks of country"
282,CHAPTER I,"attornies, and their clients, who have private bills to carry through"
283,CHAPTER I,the House.
284,CHAPTER I,
285,CHAPTER I,"Be this as it may, there was one custom of our master’s, which I"
286,CHAPTER I,"cannot pass over in silence, because I think it imitable and worthy of"
287,CHAPTER I,"imitation. He would often permit our exercises, under some pretext of"
288,CHAPTER I,"want of time, to accumulate, till each lad had four or five to be looked"
289,CHAPTER I,"over. Then placing the whole number abreast on his desk, he would"
290,CHAPTER I,"ask the writer, why this or that sentence might not have found"
291,CHAPTER I,as appropriate a place under this or that other thesis: and if no
292,CHAPTER I,"satisfying answer could be returned, and two faults of the same kind"
293,CHAPTER I,"were found in one exercise, the irrevocable verdict followed, the"
294,CHAPTER I,"exercise was torn up, and another on the same subject to be produced, in"
295,CHAPTER I,"addition to the tasks of the day. The reader will, I trust, excuse this"
296,CHAPTER I,"tribute of recollection to a man, whose severities, even now, not seldom"
297,CHAPTER I,"furnish the dreams, by which the blind fancy would fain interpret to the"
298,CHAPTER I,mind the painful sensations of distempered sleep; but neither lessen nor
299,CHAPTER I,dim the deep sense of my moral and intellectual obligations. He sent
300,CHAPTER I,"us to the University excellent Latin and Greek scholars, and tolerable"
301,CHAPTER I,"Hebraists. Yet our classical knowledge was the least of the good gifts,"
302,CHAPTER I,which we derived from his zealous and conscientious tutorage. He is now
303,CHAPTER I,"gone to his final reward, full of years, and full of honours, even of"
304,CHAPTER I,"those honours, which were dearest to his heart, as gratefully bestowed"
305,CHAPTER I,"by that school, and still binding him to the interests of that school,"
306,CHAPTER I,"in which he had been himself educated, and to which during his whole"
307,CHAPTER I,life he was a dedicated thing.
308,CHAPTER I,
309,CHAPTER I,"From causes, which this is not the place to investigate, no models"
310,CHAPTER I,"of past times, however perfect, can have the same vivid effect on"
311,CHAPTER I,"the youthful mind, as the productions of contemporary genius. The"
312,CHAPTER I,"discipline, my mind had undergone, Ne falleretur rotundo sono et versuum"
313,CHAPTER I,"cursu, cincinnis, et floribus; sed ut inspiceret quidnam subesset, quae,"
314,CHAPTER I,"sedes, quod firmamentum, quis fundus verbis; an figures essent mera"
315,CHAPTER I,ornatura et orationis fucus; vel sanguinis e materiae ipsius corde
316,CHAPTER I,effluentis rubor quidam nativus et incalescentia genuina;--removed all
317,CHAPTER I,obstacles to the appreciation of excellence in style without diminishing
318,CHAPTER I,my delight. That I was thus prepared for the perusal of Mr. Bowles’s
319,CHAPTER I,"sonnets and earlier poems, at once increased their influence, and my"
320,CHAPTER I,enthusiasm. The great works of past ages seem to a young man things of
321,CHAPTER I,"another race, in respect to which his faculties must remain passive"
322,CHAPTER I,"and submiss, even as to the stars and mountains. But the writings of a"
323,CHAPTER I,"contemporary, perhaps not many years older than himself, surrounded by"
324,CHAPTER I,"the same circumstances, and disciplined by the same manners, possess a"
325,CHAPTER I,"reality for him, and inspire an actual friendship as of a man for a man."
326,CHAPTER I,His very admiration is the wind which fans and feeds his hope. The
327,CHAPTER I,"poems themselves assume the properties of flesh and blood. To recite, to"
328,CHAPTER I,"extol, to contend for them is but the payment of a debt due to one, who"
329,CHAPTER I,exists to receive it.
330,CHAPTER I,
331,CHAPTER I,"There are indeed modes of teaching which have produced, and are"
332,CHAPTER I,"producing, youths of a very different stamp; modes of teaching, in"
333,CHAPTER I,comparison with which we have been called on to despise our great public
334,CHAPTER I,"schools, and universities,"
335,CHAPTER I,
336,CHAPTER I,in whose halls are hung
337,CHAPTER I,Armoury of the invincible knights of old--
338,CHAPTER I,
339,CHAPTER I,"modes, by which children are to be metamorphosed into prodigies. And"
340,CHAPTER I,prodigies with a vengeance have I known thus produced; prodigies of
341,CHAPTER I,"self-conceit, shallowness, arrogance, and infidelity! Instead of"
342,CHAPTER I,"storing the memory, during the period when the memory is the predominant"
343,CHAPTER I,"faculty, with facts for the after exercise of the judgment; and instead"
344,CHAPTER I,of awakening by the noblest models the fond and unmixed love and
345,CHAPTER I,"admiration, which is the natural and graceful temper of early youth;"
346,CHAPTER I,these nurslings of improved pedagogy are taught to dispute and decide;
347,CHAPTER I,to suspect all but their own and their lecturer’s wisdom; and to
348,CHAPTER I,"hold nothing sacred from their contempt, but their own contemptible"
349,CHAPTER I,"arrogance; boy-graduates in all the technicals, and in all the dirty"
350,CHAPTER I,passions and impudence of anonymous criticism. To such dispositions
351,CHAPTER I,"alone can the admonition of Pliny be requisite, Neque enim debet"
352,CHAPTER I,"operibus ejus obesse, quod vivit. An si inter eos, quos nunquam vidimus,"
353,CHAPTER I,"floruisset, non solum libros ejus, verum etiam imagines conquireremus,"
354,CHAPTER I,"ejusdem nunc honor prasentis, et gratia quasi satietate languescet?"
355,CHAPTER I,"At hoc pravum, malignumque est, non admirari hominem admiratione"
356,CHAPTER I,"dignissimum, quia videre, complecti, nec laudare tantum, verum etiam"
357,CHAPTER I,amare contingit.
358,CHAPTER I,
359,CHAPTER I,"I had just entered on my seventeenth year, when the sonnets of Mr."
360,CHAPTER I,"Bowles, twenty in number, and just then published in a quarto pamphlet,"
361,CHAPTER I,"were first made known and presented to me, by a schoolfellow who had"
362,CHAPTER I,"quitted us for the University, and who, during the whole time that he"
363,CHAPTER I,"was in our first form (or in our school language a Grecian,) had been my"
364,CHAPTER I,"patron and protector. I refer to Dr. Middleton, the truly learned, and"
365,CHAPTER I,every way excellent Bishop of Calcutta:
366,CHAPTER I,
367,CHAPTER I,qui laudibus amplis
368,CHAPTER I,"Ingenium celebrare meum, calamumque solebat,"
369,CHAPTER I,Calcar agens animo validum. Non omnia terra
370,CHAPTER I,"Obruta; vivit amor, vivit dolor; ora negatur"
371,CHAPTER I,Dulcia conspicere; at fiere et meminisse relictum est.
372,CHAPTER I,
373,CHAPTER I,"It was a double pleasure to me, and still remains a tender recollection,"
374,CHAPTER I,that I should have received from a friend so revered the first knowledge
375,CHAPTER I,"of a poet, by whose works, year after year, I was so enthusiastically"
376,CHAPTER I,delighted and inspired. My earliest acquaintances will not have
377,CHAPTER I,"forgotten the undisciplined eagerness and impetuous zeal, with which I"
378,CHAPTER I,"laboured to make proselytes, not only of my companions, but of all with"
379,CHAPTER I,"whom I conversed, of whatever rank, and in whatever place. As my school"
380,CHAPTER I,"finances did not permit me to purchase copies, I made, within less than"
381,CHAPTER I,"a year and a half, more than forty transcriptions, as the best presents"
382,CHAPTER I,"I could offer to those, who had in any way won my regard. And with"
383,CHAPTER I,almost equal delight did I receive the three or four following
384,CHAPTER I,publications of the same author.
385,CHAPTER I,
386,CHAPTER I,"Though I have seen and known enough of mankind to be well aware, that"
387,CHAPTER I,"I shall perhaps stand alone in my creed, and that it will be well, if"
388,CHAPTER I,I subject myself to no worse charge than that of singularity; I am not
389,CHAPTER I,"therefore deterred from avowing, that I regard, and ever have regarded"
390,CHAPTER I,the obligations of intellect among the most sacred of the claims of
391,CHAPTER I,"gratitude. A valuable thought, or a particular train of thoughts, gives"
392,CHAPTER I,"me additional pleasure, when I can safely refer and attribute it to the"
393,CHAPTER I,conversation or correspondence of another. My obligations to Mr. Bowles
394,CHAPTER I,"were indeed important, and for radical good. At a very premature age,"
395,CHAPTER I,"even before my fifteenth year, I had bewildered myself in metaphysics,"
396,CHAPTER I,"and in theological controversy. Nothing else pleased me. History, and"
397,CHAPTER I,"particular facts, lost all interest in my mind. Poetry--(though for a"
398,CHAPTER I,"school-boy of that age, I was above par in English versification, and"
399,CHAPTER I,"had already produced two or three compositions which, I may venture to"
400,CHAPTER I,"say, without reference to my age, were somewhat above mediocrity, and"
401,CHAPTER I,"which had gained me more credit than the sound, good sense of my old"
402,CHAPTER I,"master was at all pleased with,)--poetry itself, yea, novels and"
403,CHAPTER I,"romances, became insipid to me. In my friendless wanderings on our"
404,CHAPTER I,"leave-days [4], (for I was an orphan, and had scarcely any connections"
405,CHAPTER I,"in London,) highly was I delighted, if any passenger, especially if he"
406,CHAPTER I,"were dressed in black, would enter into conversation with me. For I soon"
407,CHAPTER I,found the means of directing it to my favourite subjects
408,CHAPTER I,
409,CHAPTER I,"Of providence, fore-knowledge, will, and fate,"
410,CHAPTER I,"Fixed fate, free will, fore-knowledge absolute,"
411,CHAPTER I,And found no end in wandering mazes lost.
412,CHAPTER I,
413,CHAPTER I,"This preposterous pursuit was, beyond doubt, injurious both to my"
414,CHAPTER I,"natural powers, and to the progress of my education. It would perhaps"
415,CHAPTER I,"have been destructive, had it been continued; but from this I was"
416,CHAPTER I,"auspiciously withdrawn, partly indeed by an accidental introduction to"
417,CHAPTER I,"an amiable family, chiefly however, by the genial influence of a style"
418,CHAPTER I,"of poetry, so tender and yet so manly, so natural and real, and yet so"
419,CHAPTER I,"dignified and harmonious, as the sonnets and other early poems of Mr."
420,CHAPTER I,"Bowles. Well would it have been for me, perhaps, had I never relapsed"
421,CHAPTER I,into the same mental disease; if I had continued to pluck the flower and
422,CHAPTER I,"reap the harvest from the cultivated surface, instead of delving in the"
423,CHAPTER I,unwholesome quicksilver mines of metaphysic lore. And if in after time
424,CHAPTER I,I have sought a refuge from bodily pain and mismanaged sensibility in
425,CHAPTER I,"abstruse researches, which exercised the strength and subtilty of the"
426,CHAPTER I,understanding without awakening the feelings of the heart; still there
427,CHAPTER I,"was a long and blessed interval, during which my natural faculties were"
428,CHAPTER I,"allowed to expand, and my original tendencies to develop themselves;--my"
429,CHAPTER I,"fancy, and the love of nature, and the sense of beauty in forms and"
430,CHAPTER I,sounds.
431,CHAPTER I,
432,CHAPTER I,"The second advantage, which I owe to my early perusal, and admiration"
433,CHAPTER I,"of these poems, (to which let me add,) though known to me at a somewhat"
434,CHAPTER I,"later period, the Lewesdon Hill of Mr. Crowe bears more immediately on"
435,CHAPTER I,"my present subject. Among those with whom I conversed, there were,"
436,CHAPTER I,"of course, very many who had formed their taste, and their notions of"
437,CHAPTER I,"poetry, from the writings of Pope and his followers; or to speak more"
438,CHAPTER I,"generally, in that school of French poetry, condensed and invigorated by"
439,CHAPTER I,"English understanding, which had predominated from the last century. I"
440,CHAPTER I,"was not blind to the merits of this school, yet, as from inexperience of"
441,CHAPTER I,"the world, and consequent want of sympathy with the general subjects of"
442,CHAPTER I,"these poems, they gave me little pleasure, I doubtless undervalued the"
443,CHAPTER I,"kind, and with the presumption of youth withheld from its masters"
444,CHAPTER I,the legitimate name of poets. I saw that the excellence of this kind
445,CHAPTER I,consisted in just and acute observations on men and manners in an
446,CHAPTER I,"artificial state of society, as its matter and substance; and in the"
447,CHAPTER I,"logic of wit, conveyed in smooth and strong epigrammatic couplets, as"
448,CHAPTER I,"its form: that even when the subject was addressed to the fancy, or the"
449,CHAPTER I,"intellect, as in the Rape of the Lock, or the Essay on Man; nay, when it"
450,CHAPTER I,"was a consecutive narration, as in that astonishing product of matchless"
451,CHAPTER I,talent and ingenuity Pope’s Translation of the Iliad; still a point
452,CHAPTER I,"was looked for at the end of each second line, and the whole was, as"
453,CHAPTER I,"it were, a sorites, or, if I may exchange a logical for a grammatical"
454,CHAPTER I,"metaphor, a conjunction disjunctive, of epigrams. Meantime the matter"
455,CHAPTER I,"and diction seemed to me characterized not so much by poetic thoughts,"
456,CHAPTER I,as by thoughts translated into the language of poetry. On this last
457,CHAPTER I,"point, I had occasion to render my own thoughts gradually more and"
458,CHAPTER I,"more plain to myself, by frequent amicable disputes concerning Darwin’s"
459,CHAPTER I,"Botanic Garden, which, for some years, was greatly extolled, not only"
460,CHAPTER I,"by the reading public in general, but even by those, whose genius and"
461,CHAPTER I,natural robustness of understanding enabled them afterwards to act
462,CHAPTER I,foremost in dissipating these “painted mists” that occasionally rise
463,CHAPTER I,from the marshes at the foot of Parnassus. During my first Cambridge
464,CHAPTER I,"vacation, I assisted a friend in a contribution for a literary society"
465,CHAPTER I,in Devonshire: and in this I remember to have compared Darwin’s work to
466,CHAPTER I,"the Russian palace of ice, glittering, cold and transitory. In the same"
467,CHAPTER I,"essay too, I assigned sundry reasons, chiefly drawn from a comparison"
468,CHAPTER I,"of passages in the Latin poets with the original Greek, from which they"
469,CHAPTER I,"were borrowed, for the preference of Collins’s odes to those of Gray;"
470,CHAPTER I,and of the simile in Shakespeare
471,CHAPTER I,
472,CHAPTER I,How like a younker or a prodigal
473,CHAPTER I,"The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,"
474,CHAPTER I,Hugg’d and embraced by the strumpet wind!
475,CHAPTER I,"How like the prodigal doth she return,"
476,CHAPTER I,"With over-weather’d ribs and ragged sails,"
477,CHAPTER I,"Lean, rent, and beggar’d by the strumpet wind!"
478,CHAPTER I,(Merch. of Ven. Act II. sc. 6.)
479,CHAPTER I,
480,CHAPTER I,to the imitation in the Bard;
481,CHAPTER I,
482,CHAPTER I,"Fair laughs the morn, and soft the zephyr blows"
483,CHAPTER I,While proudly riding o’er the azure realm
484,CHAPTER I,"In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes,"
485,CHAPTER I,Youth at the prow and pleasure at the helm;
486,CHAPTER I,"Regardless of the sweeping whirlwind’s sway,"
487,CHAPTER I,"That hush’d in grim repose, expects it’s evening prey."
488,CHAPTER I,
489,CHAPTER I,"(in which, by the bye, the words “realm” and “sway” are rhymes dearly"
490,CHAPTER I,"purchased)--I preferred the original on the ground, that in the"
491,CHAPTER I,"imitation it depended wholly on the compositor’s putting, or not"
492,CHAPTER I,"putting, a small capital, both in this, and in many other passages of"
493,CHAPTER I,"the same poet, whether the words should be personifications, or mere"
494,CHAPTER I,"abstractions. I mention this, because, in referring various lines in"
495,CHAPTER I,"Gray to their original in Shakespeare and Milton, and in the clear"
496,CHAPTER I,"perception how completely all the propriety was lost in the transfer,"
497,CHAPTER I,"I was, at that early period, led to a conjecture, which, many years"
498,CHAPTER I,afterwards was recalled to me from the same thought having been started
499,CHAPTER I,"in conversation, but far more ably, and developed more fully, by"
500,CHAPTER I,"Mr. Wordsworth;--namely, that this style of poetry, which I have"
501,CHAPTER I,"characterized above, as translations of prose thoughts into poetic"
502,CHAPTER I,"language, had been kept up by, if it did not wholly arise from, the"
503,CHAPTER I,"custom of writing Latin verses, and the great importance attached to"
504,CHAPTER I,"these exercises, in our public schools. Whatever might have been the"
505,CHAPTER I,"case in the fifteenth century, when the use of the Latin tongue was so"
506,CHAPTER I,"general among learned men, that Erasmus is said to have forgotten his"
507,CHAPTER I,"native language; yet in the present day it is not to be supposed, that a"
508,CHAPTER I,"youth can think in Latin, or that he can have any other reliance on the"
509,CHAPTER I,"force or fitness of his phrases, but the authority of the writer"
510,CHAPTER I,from whom he has adopted them. Consequently he must first prepare his
511,CHAPTER I,"thoughts, and then pick out, from Virgil, Horace, Ovid, or perhaps more"
512,CHAPTER I,"compendiously from his Gradus, halves and quarters of lines, in which to"
513,CHAPTER I,embody them.
514,CHAPTER I,
515,CHAPTER I,I never object to a certain degree of disputatiousness in a young man
516,CHAPTER I,"from the age of seventeen to that of four or five and twenty, provided I"
517,CHAPTER I,"find him always arguing on one side of the question. The controversies,"
518,CHAPTER I,occasioned by my unfeigned zeal for the honour of a favourite
519,CHAPTER I,"contemporary, then known to me only by his works, were of great"
520,CHAPTER I,advantage in the formation and establishment of my taste and critical
521,CHAPTER I,"opinions. In my defence of the lines running into each other, instead of"
522,CHAPTER I,"closing at each couplet; and of natural language, neither bookish, nor"
523,CHAPTER I,"vulgar, neither redolent of the lamp, nor of the kennel, such as I will"
524,CHAPTER I,remember thee; instead of the same thought tricked up in the rag-fair
525,CHAPTER I,"finery of,"
526,CHAPTER I,
527,CHAPTER I,------thy image on her wing
528,CHAPTER I,"Before my fancy’s eye shall memory bring,--"
529,CHAPTER I,
530,CHAPTER I,"I had continually to adduce the metre and diction of the Greek poets,"
531,CHAPTER I,from Homer to Theocritus inclusively; and still more of our elder
532,CHAPTER I,"English poets, from Chaucer to Milton. Nor was this all. But as it was"
533,CHAPTER I,my constant reply to authorities brought against me from later poets
534,CHAPTER I,"of great name, that no authority could avail in opposition to Truth,"
535,CHAPTER I,"Nature, Logic, and the Laws of Universal Grammar; actuated too by my"
536,CHAPTER I,former passion for metaphysical investigations; I laboured at a solid
537,CHAPTER I,"foundation, on which permanently to ground my opinions, in the component"
538,CHAPTER I,"faculties of the human mind itself, and their comparative dignity and"
539,CHAPTER I,"importance. According to the faculty or source, from which the pleasure"
540,CHAPTER I,"given by any poem or passage was derived, I estimated the merit of"
541,CHAPTER I,"such poem or passage. As the result of all my reading and meditation,"
542,CHAPTER I,"I abstracted two critical aphorisms, deeming them to comprise the"
543,CHAPTER I,"conditions and criteria of poetic style;--first, that not the poem which"
544,CHAPTER I,"we have read, but that to which we return, with the greatest pleasure,"
545,CHAPTER I,"possesses the genuine power, and claims the name of essential"
546,CHAPTER I,"poetry;--secondly, that whatever lines can be translated into other"
547,CHAPTER I,"words of the same language, without diminution of their significance,"
548,CHAPTER I,"either in sense or association, or in any worthy feeling, are so far"
549,CHAPTER I,"vicious in their diction. Be it however observed, that I excluded from"
550,CHAPTER I,"the list of worthy feelings, the pleasure derived from mere novelty in"
551,CHAPTER I,"the reader, and the desire of exciting wonderment at his powers in the"
552,CHAPTER I,"author. Oftentimes since then, in pursuing French tragedies, I"
553,CHAPTER I,"have fancied two marks of admiration at the end of each line, as"
554,CHAPTER I,hieroglyphics of the author’s own admiration at his own cleverness.
555,CHAPTER I,Our genuine admiration of a great poet is a continuous undercurrent of
556,CHAPTER I,"feeling! it is everywhere present, but seldom anywhere as a separate"
557,CHAPTER I,"excitement. I was wont boldly to affirm, that it would be scarcely more"
558,CHAPTER I,"difficult to push a stone out from the Pyramids with the bare hand, than"
559,CHAPTER I,"to alter a word, or the position of a word, in Milton or Shakespeare,"
560,CHAPTER I,"(in their most important works at least,) without making the poet"
561,CHAPTER I,"say something else, or something worse, than he does say. One great"
562,CHAPTER I,"distinction, I appeared to myself to see plainly between even the"
563,CHAPTER I,"characteristic faults of our elder poets, and the false beauty of the"
564,CHAPTER I,"moderns. In the former, from Donne to Cowley, we find the most fantastic"
565,CHAPTER I,"out-of-the-way thoughts, but in the most pure and genuine mother"
566,CHAPTER I,"English, in the latter the most obvious thoughts, in language the most"
567,CHAPTER I,fantastic and arbitrary. Our faulty elder poets sacrificed the passion
568,CHAPTER I,and passionate flow of poetry to the subtleties of intellect and to the
569,CHAPTER I,"stars of wit; the moderns to the glare and glitter of a perpetual, yet"
570,CHAPTER I,"broken and heterogeneous imagery, or rather to an amphibious something,"
571,CHAPTER I,"made up, half of image, and half of abstract [5] meaning. The one"
572,CHAPTER I,sacrificed the heart to the head; the other both heart and head to point
573,CHAPTER I,and drapery.
574,CHAPTER I,
575,CHAPTER I,The reader must make himself acquainted with the general style of
576,CHAPTER I,"composition that was at that time deemed poetry, in order to understand"
577,CHAPTER I,"and account for the effect produced on me by the Sonnets, the Monody"
578,CHAPTER I,"at Matlock, and the Hope, of Mr. Bowles; for it is peculiar to original"
579,CHAPTER I,"genius to become less and less striking, in proportion to its success"
580,CHAPTER I,in improving the taste and judgment of its contemporaries. The poems of
581,CHAPTER I,"West, indeed, had the merit of chaste and manly diction; but they were"
582,CHAPTER I,"cold, and, if I may so express it, only dead-coloured; while in the"
583,CHAPTER I,"best of Warton’s there is a stiffness, which too often gives them the"
584,CHAPTER I,"appearance of imitations from the Greek. Whatever relation, therefore,"
585,CHAPTER I,of cause or impulse Percy’s collection of Ballads may bear to the most
586,CHAPTER I,popular poems of the present day; yet in a more sustained and elevated
587,CHAPTER I,"style, of the then living poets, Cowper and Bowles [6] were, to the best"
588,CHAPTER I,"of my knowledge, the first who combined natural thoughts with natural"
589,CHAPTER I,diction; the first who reconciled the heart with the head.
590,CHAPTER I,
591,CHAPTER I,"It is true, as I have before mentioned, that from diffidence in my own"
592,CHAPTER I,"powers, I for a short time adopted a laborious and florid diction, which"
593,CHAPTER I,"I myself deemed, if not absolutely vicious, yet of very inferior worth."
594,CHAPTER I,"Gradually, however, my practice conformed to my better judgment; and the"
595,CHAPTER I,"compositions of my twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth years--(for example,"
596,CHAPTER I,"the shorter blank verse poems, the lines, which now form the middle and"
597,CHAPTER I,"conclusion of the poem entitled the Destiny of Nations, and the tragedy"
598,CHAPTER I,of Remorse)--are not more below my present ideal in respect of the
599,CHAPTER I,general tissue of the style than those of the latest date. Their faults
600,CHAPTER I,"were at least a remnant of the former leaven, and among the many who"
601,CHAPTER I,have done me the honour of putting my poems in the same class with those
602,CHAPTER I,"of my betters, the one or two, who have pretended to bring examples of"
603,CHAPTER I,"affected simplicity from my volume, have been able to adduce but"
604,CHAPTER I,"one instance, and that out of a copy of verses half ludicrous, half"
605,CHAPTER I,"splenetic, which I intended, and had myself characterized, as sermoni"
606,CHAPTER I,propiora.
607,CHAPTER I,
608,CHAPTER I,"Every reform, however necessary, will by weak minds be carried to an"
609,CHAPTER I,"excess, which will itself need reforming. The reader will excuse me for"
610,CHAPTER I,"noticing, that I myself was the first to expose risu honesto the three"
611,CHAPTER I,"sins of poetry, one or the other of which is the most likely to beset a"
612,CHAPTER I,young writer. So long ago as the publication of the second number of the
613,CHAPTER I,"Monthly Magazine, under the name of Nehemiah Higginbottom, I contributed"
614,CHAPTER I,"three sonnets, the first of which had for its object to excite a"
615,CHAPTER I,"good-natured laugh at the spirit of doleful egotism, and at the"
616,CHAPTER I,"recurrence of favourite phrases, with the double defect of being at"
617,CHAPTER I,once trite and licentious;--the second was on low creeping language and
618,CHAPTER I,"thoughts, under the pretence of simplicity; the third, the phrases of"
619,CHAPTER I,"which were borrowed entirely from my own poems, on the indiscriminate"
620,CHAPTER I,use of elaborate and swelling language and imagery. The reader will find
621,CHAPTER I,"them in the note [7] below, and will I trust regard them as reprinted"
622,CHAPTER I,"for biographical purposes alone, and not for their poetic merits. So"
623,CHAPTER I,"general at that time, and so decided was the opinion concerning the"
624,CHAPTER I,"characteristic vices of my style, that a celebrated physician (now,"
625,CHAPTER I,"alas! no more) speaking of me in other respects with his usual kindness,"
626,CHAPTER I,"to a gentleman, who was about to meet me at a dinner party, could not"
627,CHAPTER I,however resist giving him a hint not to mention ‘The house that Jack
628,CHAPTER I,"built’ in my presence, for “that I was as sore as a boil about that"
629,CHAPTER I,sonnet;” he not knowing that I was myself the author of it.

638,CHAPTER II,
639,CHAPTER II,
640,CHAPTER II,"I have often thought, that it would be neither uninstructive nor"
641,CHAPTER II,"unamusing to analyze, and bring forward into distinct consciousness,"
642,CHAPTER II,"that complex feeling, with which readers in general take part against"
643,CHAPTER II,"the author, in favour of the critic; and the readiness with which they"
644,CHAPTER II,apply to all poets the old sarcasm of Horace upon the scribblers of his
645,CHAPTER II,time
646,CHAPTER II,
647,CHAPTER II,------genus irritabile vatum.
648,CHAPTER II,
649,CHAPTER II,"A debility and dimness of the imaginative power, and a consequent"
650,CHAPTER II,"necessity of reliance on the immediate impressions of the senses, do, we"
651,CHAPTER II,"know well, render the mind liable to superstition and fanaticism. Having"
652,CHAPTER II,"a deficient portion of internal and proper warmth, minds of this class"
653,CHAPTER II,"seek in the crowd circum fana for a warmth in common, which they do not"
654,CHAPTER II,"possess singly. Cold and phlegmatic in their own nature, like damp"
655,CHAPTER II,"hay, they heat and inflame by co-acervation; or like bees they become"
656,CHAPTER II,restless and irritable through the increased temperature of collected
657,CHAPTER II,"multitudes. Hence the German word for fanaticism, (such at least was"
658,CHAPTER II,"its original import,) is derived from the swarming of bees, namely,"
659,CHAPTER II,"schwaermen, schwaermerey. The passion being in an inverse proportion to"
660,CHAPTER II,"the insight,--that the more vivid, as this the less distinct--anger is"
661,CHAPTER II,the inevitable consequence. The absense of all foundation within their
662,CHAPTER II,"own minds for that, which they yet believe both true and indispensable"
663,CHAPTER II,"to their safety and happiness, cannot but produce an uneasy state of"
664,CHAPTER II,"feeling, an involuntary sense of fear from which nature has no means"
665,CHAPTER II,of rescuing herself but by anger. Experience informs us that the first
666,CHAPTER II,defence of weak minds is to recriminate.
667,CHAPTER II,
668,CHAPTER II,"There’s no philosopher but sees,"
669,CHAPTER II,That rage and fear are one disease;
670,CHAPTER II,"Tho’ that may burn, and this may freeze,"
671,CHAPTER II,They’re both alike the ague.
672,CHAPTER II,
673,CHAPTER II,"But where the ideas are vivid, and there exists an endless power of"
674,CHAPTER II,"combining and modifying them, the feelings and affections blend more"
675,CHAPTER II,easily and intimately with these ideal creations than with the objects
676,CHAPTER II,"of the senses; the mind is affected by thoughts, rather than by things;"
677,CHAPTER II,and only then feels the requisite interest even for the most important
678,CHAPTER II,"events and accidents, when by means of meditation they have passed into"
679,CHAPTER II,thoughts. The sanity of the mind is between superstition with fanaticism
680,CHAPTER II,"on the one hand, and enthusiasm with indifference and a diseased"
681,CHAPTER II,slowness to action on the other. For the conceptions of the mind may be
682,CHAPTER II,"so vivid and adequate, as to preclude that impulse to the realizing of"
683,CHAPTER II,"them, which is strongest and most restless in those, who possess more"
684,CHAPTER II,"than mere talent, (or the faculty of appropriating and applying the"
685,CHAPTER II,"knowledge of others,)--yet still want something of the creative and"
686,CHAPTER II,"self-sufficing power of absolute genius. For this reason therefore,"
687,CHAPTER II,they are men of commanding genius. While the former rest content between
688,CHAPTER II,"thought and reality, as it were in an intermundium of which their"
689,CHAPTER II,"own living spirit supplies the substance, and their imagination the"
690,CHAPTER II,ever-varying form; the latter must impress their preconceptions on the
691,CHAPTER II,"world without, in order to present them back to their own view with the"
692,CHAPTER II,"satisfying degree of clearness, distinctness, and individuality. These"
693,CHAPTER II,"in tranquil times are formed to exhibit a perfect poem in palace, or"
694,CHAPTER II,"temple, or landscape-garden; or a tale of romance in canals that join"
695,CHAPTER II,"sea with sea, or in walls of rock, which, shouldering back the billows,"
696,CHAPTER II,"imitate the power, and supply the benevolence of nature to sheltered"
697,CHAPTER II,"navies; or in aqueducts that, arching the wide vale from mountain to"
698,CHAPTER II,"mountain, give a Palmyra to the desert. But alas! in times of tumult"
699,CHAPTER II,"they are the men destined to come forth as the shaping spirit of ruin,"
700,CHAPTER II,to destroy the wisdom of ages in order to substitute the fancies of a
701,CHAPTER II,"day, and to change kings and kingdoms, as the wind shifts and shapes the"
702,CHAPTER II,clouds [8]. The records of biography seem to confirm this theory. The
703,CHAPTER II,"men of the greatest genius, as far as we can judge from their own works"
704,CHAPTER II,"or from the accounts of their contemporaries, appear to have been of"
705,CHAPTER II,calm and tranquil temper in all that related to themselves. In the
706,CHAPTER II,"inward assurance of permanent fame, they seem to have been either"
707,CHAPTER II,indifferent or resigned with regard to immediate reputation. Through all
708,CHAPTER II,"the works of Chaucer there reigns a cheerfulness, a manly hilarity which"
709,CHAPTER II,makes it almost impossible to doubt a correspondent habit of feeling in
710,CHAPTER II,the author himself. Shakespeare’s evenness and sweetness of temper were
711,CHAPTER II,almost proverbial in his own age. That this did not arise from ignorance
712,CHAPTER II,"of his own comparative greatness, we have abundant proof in his Sonnets,"
713,CHAPTER II,"which could scarcely have been known to Pope [9], when he asserted, that"
714,CHAPTER II,our great bard--
715,CHAPTER II,
716,CHAPTER II,------grew immortal in his own despite.
717,CHAPTER II,(Epist. to Augustus.)
718,CHAPTER II,
719,CHAPTER II,"Speaking of one whom he had celebrated, and contrasting the duration of"
720,CHAPTER II,"his works with that of his personal existence, Shakespeare adds:"
721,CHAPTER II,
722,CHAPTER II,"Your name from hence immortal life shall have,"
723,CHAPTER II,Tho’ I once gone to all the world must die;
724,CHAPTER II,"The earth can yield me but a common grave,"
725,CHAPTER II,When you entombed in men’s eyes shall lie.
726,CHAPTER II,"Your monument shall be my gentle verse,"
727,CHAPTER II,Which eyes not yet created shall o’er-read;
728,CHAPTER II,"And tongues to be your being shall rehearse,"
729,CHAPTER II,When all the breathers of this world are dead:

731,CHAPTER II,"Where breath most breathes, e’en in the mouth of men."

736,SONNET LXXXI.,"with those whom he deemed most worthy of his praise, are alike"
737,SONNET LXXXI.,manifested in another Sonnet.
738,SONNET LXXXI.,
739,SONNET LXXXI.,"Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,"
740,SONNET LXXXI.,"Bound for the praise of all-too-precious you,"
741,SONNET LXXXI.,"That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,"
742,SONNET LXXXI.,"Making their tomb, the womb wherein they grew?"
743,SONNET LXXXI.,"Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write"
744,SONNET LXXXI.,Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead?
745,SONNET LXXXI.,"No, neither he, nor his compeers by night"
746,SONNET LXXXI.,"Giving him aid, my verse astonished."
747,SONNET LXXXI.,"He, nor that affable familiar ghost,"
748,SONNET LXXXI.,"Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,"
749,SONNET LXXXI.,As victors of my silence cannot boast;
750,SONNET LXXXI.,I was not sick of any fear from thence!
751,SONNET LXXXI.,"But when your countenance fill’d up his line,"
752,SONNET LXXXI.,"Then lack’d I matter, that enfeebled mine."
753,S. LXXXVI.,S. LXXXVI.
754,S. LXXXVI.,
755,S. LXXXVI.,"In Spenser, indeed, we trace a mind constitutionally tender, delicate,"
756,S. LXXXVI.,"and, in comparison with his three great compeers, I had almost said,"
757,S. LXXXVI.,effeminate; and this additionally saddened by the unjust persecution of
758,S. LXXXVI.,"Burleigh, and the severe calamities, which overwhelmed his latter days."
759,S. LXXXVI.,These causes have diffused over all his compositions “a melancholy
760,S. LXXXVI.,"grace,” and have drawn forth occasional strains, the more pathetic"
761,S. LXXXVI.,from their gentleness. But no where do we find the least trace of
762,S. LXXXVI.,"irritability, and still less of quarrelsome or affected contempt of his"
763,S. LXXXVI.,censurers.
764,S. LXXXVI.,
765,S. LXXXVI.,"The same calmness, and even greater self-possession, may be affirmed"
766,S. LXXXVI.,"of Milton, as far as his poems, and poetic character are concerned."
767,S. LXXXVI.,"He reserved his anger for the enemies of religion, freedom, and his"
768,S. LXXXVI.,"country. My mind is not capable of forming a more august conception,"
769,S. LXXXVI.,than arises from the contemplation of this great man in his latter
770,S. LXXXVI.,"days;--poor, sick, old, blind, slandered, persecuted,--"
771,S. LXXXVI.,
772,S. LXXXVI.,"Darkness before, and danger’s voice behind,--"
773,S. LXXXVI.,
774,S. LXXXVI.,"in an age in which he was as little understood by the party, for whom,"
775,S. LXXXVI.,"as by that against whom, he had contended; and among men before whom he"
776,S. LXXXVI.,strode so far as to dwarf himself by the distance; yet still listening
777,S. LXXXVI.,"to the music of his own thoughts, or if additionally cheered,"
778,S. LXXXVI.,yet cheered only by the prophetic faith of two or three solitary
779,S. LXXXVI.,"individuals, he did nevertheless"
780,S. LXXXVI.,
781,S. LXXXVI.,------argue not
782,S. LXXXVI.,"Against Heaven’s hand or will, nor bate a jot"
783,S. LXXXVI.,Of heart or hope; but still bore up and steer’d
784,S. LXXXVI.,Right onward.
785,S. LXXXVI.,
786,S. LXXXVI.,"From others only do we derive our knowledge that Milton, in his latter"
787,S. LXXXVI.,"day, had his scorners and detractors; and even in his day of youth and"
788,S. LXXXVI.,"hope, that he had enemies would have been unknown to us, had they not"
789,S. LXXXVI.,been likewise the enemies of his country.
790,S. LXXXVI.,
791,S. LXXXVI.,"I am well aware, that in advanced stages of literature, when there exist"
792,S. LXXXVI.,"many and excellent models, a high degree of talent, combined with taste"
793,S. LXXXVI.,"and judgment, and employed in works of imagination, will acquire for"
794,S. LXXXVI.,"a man the name of a great genius; though even that analogon of genius,"
795,S. LXXXVI.,"which, in certain states of society, may even render his writings more"
796,S. LXXXVI.,"popular than the absolute reality could have done, would be sought"
797,S. LXXXVI.,for in vain in the mind and temper of the author himself. Yet even in
798,S. LXXXVI.,"instances of this kind, a close examination will often detect, that the"
799,S. LXXXVI.,"irritability, which has been attributed to the author’s genius as its"
800,S. LXXXVI.,"cause, did really originate in an ill conformation of body, obtuse pain,"
801,S. LXXXVI.,or constitutional defect of pleasurable sensation. What is charged to
802,S. LXXXVI.,"the author, belongs to the man, who would probably have been still more"
803,S. LXXXVI.,"impatient, but for the humanizing influences of the very pursuit, which"
804,S. LXXXVI.,yet bears the blame of his irritability.
805,S. LXXXVI.,
806,S. LXXXVI.,How then are we to explain the easy credence generally given to this
807,S. LXXXVI.,"charge, if the charge itself be not, as I have endeavoured to show,"
808,S. LXXXVI.,supported by experience? This seems to me of no very difficult solution.
809,S. LXXXVI.,"In whatever country literature is widely diffused, there will be many"
810,S. LXXXVI.,who mistake an intense desire to possess the reputation of poetic
811,S. LXXXVI.,"genius, for the actual powers, and original tendencies which constitute"
812,S. LXXXVI.,"it. But men, whose dearest wishes are fixed on objects wholly out of"
813,S. LXXXVI.,"their own power, become in all cases more or less impatient and prone to"
814,S. LXXXVI.,"anger. Besides, though it may be paradoxical to assert, that a man can"
815,S. LXXXVI.,"know one thing and believe the opposite, yet assuredly a vain person may"
816,S. LXXXVI.,"have so habitually indulged the wish, and persevered in the attempt, to"
817,S. LXXXVI.,"appear what he is not, as to become himself one of his own proselytes."
818,S. LXXXVI.,"Still, as this counterfeit and artificial persuasion must differ, even"
819,S. LXXXVI.,"in the person’s own feelings, from a real sense of inward power, what"
820,S. LXXXVI.,"can be more natural, than that this difference should betray itself"
821,S. LXXXVI.,"in suspicious and jealous irritability? Even as the flowery sod, which"
822,S. LXXXVI.,"covers a hollow, may be often detected by its shaking and trembling."
823,S. LXXXVI.,
824,S. LXXXVI.,"But, alas! the multitude of books and the general diffusion of"
825,S. LXXXVI.,"literature, have produced other and more lamentable effects in the world"
826,S. LXXXVI.,"of letters, and such as are abundant to explain, though by no means to"
827,S. LXXXVI.,"justify, the contempt with which the best grounded complaints of injured"
828,S. LXXXVI.,"genius are rejected as frivolous, or entertained as matter of merriment."
829,S. LXXXVI.,"In the days of Chaucer and Gower, our language might (with due allowance"
830,S. LXXXVI.,for the imperfections of a simile) be compared to a wilderness of vocal
831,S. LXXXVI.,"reeds, from which the favourites only of Pan or Apollo could construct"
832,S. LXXXVI.,even the rude syrinx; and from this the constructors alone could elicit
833,S. LXXXVI.,"strains of music. But now, partly by the labours of successive"
834,S. LXXXVI.,"poets, and in part by the more artificial state of society and social"
835,S. LXXXVI.,"intercourse, language, mechanized as it were into a barrel-organ,"
836,S. LXXXVI.,"supplies at once both instrument and tune. Thus even the deaf may play,"
837,S. LXXXVI.,"so as to delight the many. Sometimes (for it is with similes, as it"
838,S. LXXXVI.,"is with jests at a wine table, one is sure to suggest another) I have"
839,S. LXXXVI.,"attempted to illustrate the present state of our language, in its"
840,S. LXXXVI.,"relation to literature, by a press-room of larger and smaller stereotype"
841,S. LXXXVI.,"pieces, which, in the present Anglo-Gallican fashion of unconnected,"
842,S. LXXXVI.,"epigrammatic periods, it requires but an ordinary portion of ingenuity"
843,S. LXXXVI.,"to vary indefinitely, and yet still produce something, which, if not"
844,S. LXXXVI.,"sense, will be so like it as to do as well. Perhaps better: for it"
845,S. LXXXVI.,"spares the reader the trouble of thinking; prevents vacancy, while"
846,S. LXXXVI.,it indulges indolence; and secures the memory from all danger of an
847,S. LXXXVI.,"intellectual plethora. Hence of all trades, literature at present"
848,S. LXXXVI.,"demands the least talent or information; and, of all modes of"
849,S. LXXXVI.,"literature, the manufacturing of poems. The difference indeed between"
850,S. LXXXVI.,these and the works of genius is not less than between an egg and an
851,S. LXXXVI.,egg-shell; yet at a distance they both look alike.
852,S. LXXXVI.,
853,S. LXXXVI.,"Now it is no less remarkable than true, with how little examination"
854,S. LXXXVI.,"works of polite literature are commonly perused, not only by the mass of"
855,S. LXXXVI.,"readers, but by men of first rate ability, till some accident or chance"
856,S. LXXXVI.,"[10] discussion have roused their attention, and put them on their"
857,S. LXXXVI.,guard. And hence individuals below mediocrity not less in natural power
858,S. LXXXVI.,"than in acquired knowledge; nay, bunglers who have failed in the lowest"
859,S. LXXXVI.,"mechanic crafts, and whose presumption is in due proportion to their"
860,S. LXXXVI.,"want of sense and sensibility; men, who being first scribblers"
861,S. LXXXVI.,"from idleness and ignorance, next become libellers from envy and"
862,S. LXXXVI.,"malevolence,--have been able to drive a successful trade in the"
863,S. LXXXVI.,"employment of the booksellers, nay, have raised themselves into"
864,S. LXXXVI.,"temporary name and reputation with the public at large, by that most"
865,S. LXXXVI.,"powerful of all adulation, the appeal to the bad and malignant passions"
866,S. LXXXVI.,"of mankind [11]. But as it is the nature of scorn, envy, and all"
867,S. LXXXVI.,"malignant propensities to require a quick change of objects, such"
868,S. LXXXVI.,"writers are sure, sooner or later, to awake from their dream of vanity"
869,S. LXXXVI.,to disappointment and neglect with embittered and envenomed feelings.
870,S. LXXXVI.,"Even during their short-lived success, sensible in spite of themselves"
871,S. LXXXVI.,"on what a shifting foundation it rests, they resent the mere refusal"
872,S. LXXXVI.,"of praise as a robbery, and at the justest censures kindle at once into"
873,S. LXXXVI.,violent and undisciplined abuse; till the acute disease changing into
874,S. LXXXVI.,"chronical, the more deadly as the less violent, they become the fit"
875,S. LXXXVI.,instruments of literary detraction and moral slander. They are then no
876,S. LXXXVI.,"longer to be questioned without exposing the complainant to ridicule,"
877,S. LXXXVI.,"because, forsooth, they are anonymous critics, and authorized, in Andrew"
878,S. LXXXVI.,"Marvell’s phrase, as “synodical individuals” to speak of themselves"
879,S. LXXXVI.,"plurali majestatico! As if literature formed a caste, like that of"
880,S. LXXXVI.,"the Paras in Hindostan, who, however maltreated, must not dare to deem"
881,S. LXXXVI.,"themselves wronged! As if that, which in all other cases adds a deeper"
882,S. LXXXVI.,"dye to slander, the circumstance of its being anonymous, here acted"
883,S. LXXXVI.,"only to make the slanderer inviolable! [12] Thus, in part, from the"
884,S. LXXXVI.,"accidental tempers of individuals--(men of undoubted talent, but not"
885,S. LXXXVI.,men of genius)--tempers rendered yet more irritable by their desire to
886,S. LXXXVI.,appear men of genius; but still more effectively by the excesses of the
887,S. LXXXVI.,mere counterfeits both of talent and genius; the number too being so
888,S. LXXXVI.,"incomparably greater of those who are thought to be, than of those"
889,S. LXXXVI.,"who really are men of genius; and in part from the natural, but not"
890,S. LXXXVI.,"therefore the less partial and unjust distinction, made by the public"
891,S. LXXXVI.,itself between literary and all other property; I believe the prejudice
892,S. LXXXVI.,"to have arisen, which considers an unusual irascibility concerning the"
893,S. LXXXVI.,reception of its products as characteristic of genius.
894,S. LXXXVI.,
895,S. LXXXVI.,"It might correct the moral feelings of a numerous class of readers, to"
896,S. LXXXVI.,"suppose a Review set on foot, the object of which should be to criticise"
897,S. LXXXVI.,"all the chief works presented to the public by our ribbon-weavers,"
898,S. LXXXVI.,"calico-printers, cabinet-makers, and china-manufacturers; which should"
899,S. LXXXVI.,"be conducted in the same spirit, and take the same freedom with personal"
900,S. LXXXVI.,"character, as our literary journals. They would scarcely, I think,"
901,S. LXXXVI.,"deny their belief, not only that the genus irritabile would be found"
902,S. LXXXVI.,to include many other species besides that of bards; but that the
903,S. LXXXVI.,irritability of trade would soon reduce the resentments of poets into
904,S. LXXXVI.,mere shadow-fights in the comparison. Or is wealth the only rational
905,S. LXXXVI.,"object of human interest? Or even if this were admitted, has the poet"
906,S. LXXXVI.,"no property in his works? Or is it a rare, or culpable case, that he"
907,S. LXXXVI.,"who serves at the altar of the Muses, should be compelled to derive"
908,S. LXXXVI.,"his maintenance from the altar, when too he has perhaps deliberately"
909,S. LXXXVI.,abandoned the fairest prospects of rank and opulence in order to
910,S. LXXXVI.,"devote himself, an entire and undistracted man, to the instruction or"
911,S. LXXXVI.,"refinement of his fellow-citizens? Or, should we pass by all higher"
912,S. LXXXVI.,"objects and motives, all disinterested benevolence, and even that"
913,S. LXXXVI.,"ambition of lasting praise which is at once the crutch and ornament,"
914,S. LXXXVI.,"which at once supports and betrays, the infirmity of human virtue,--is"
915,S. LXXXVI.,"the character and property of the man, who labours for our intellectual"
916,S. LXXXVI.,"pleasures, less entitled to a share of our fellow feeling, than that of"
917,S. LXXXVI.,"the wine-merchant or milliner? Sensibility indeed, both quick and deep,"
918,S. LXXXVI.,"is not only a characteristic feature, but may be deemed a component"
919,S. LXXXVI.,"part, of genius. But it is not less an essential mark of true genius,"
920,S. LXXXVI.,that its sensibility is excited by any other cause more powerfully than
921,S. LXXXVI.,"by its own personal interests; for this plain reason, that the man of"
922,S. LXXXVI.,"genius lives most in the ideal world, in which the present is still"
923,S. LXXXVI.,constituted by the future or the past; and because his feelings have
924,S. LXXXVI.,"been habitually associated with thoughts and images, to the number,"
925,S. LXXXVI.,"clearness, and vivacity of which the sensation of self is always in an"
926,S. LXXXVI.,"inverse proportion. And yet, should he perchance have occasion to repel"
927,S. LXXXVI.,"some false charge, or to rectify some erroneous censure, nothing is more"
928,S. LXXXVI.,common than for the many to mistake the general liveliness of his manner
929,S. LXXXVI.,"and language, whatever is the subject, for the effects of peculiar"
930,S. LXXXVI.,irritation from its accidental relation to himself. [13]
931,S. LXXXVI.,
932,S. LXXXVI.,"For myself, if from my own feelings, or from the less suspicious test"
933,S. LXXXVI.,"of the observations of others, I had been made aware of any literary"
934,S. LXXXVI.,"testiness or jealousy; I trust, that I should have been, however,"
935,S. LXXXVI.,neither silly nor arrogant enough to have burthened the imperfection on
936,S. LXXXVI.,genius. But an experience--(and I should not need documents in abundance
937,S. LXXXVI.,"to prove my words, if I added)--a tried experience of twenty years, has"
938,S. LXXXVI.,"taught me, that the original sin of my character consists in a careless"
939,S. LXXXVI.,"indifference to public opinion, and to the attacks of those who"
940,S. LXXXVI.,influence it; that praise and admiration have become yearly less and
941,S. LXXXVI.,"less desirable, except as marks of sympathy; nay that it is difficult"
942,S. LXXXVI.,and distressing to me to think with any interest even about the sale
943,S. LXXXVI.,"and profit of my works, important as, in my present circumstances, such"
944,S. LXXXVI.,considerations must needs be. Yet it never occurred to me to believe or
945,S. LXXXVI.,"fancy, that the quantum of intellectual power bestowed on me by nature"
946,S. LXXXVI.,or education was in any way connected with this habit of my feelings;
947,S. LXXXVI.,or that it needed any other parents or fosterers than constitutional
948,S. LXXXVI.,"indolence, aggravated into languor by ill-health; the accumulating"
949,S. LXXXVI.,"embarrassments of procrastination; the mental cowardice, which is the"
950,S. LXXXVI.,"inseparable companion of procrastination, and which makes us anxious to"
951,S. LXXXVI.,think and converse on any thing rather than on what concerns ourselves;
952,S. LXXXVI.,"in fine, all those close vexations, whether chargeable on my faults"
953,S. LXXXVI.,"or my fortunes, which leave me but little grief to spare for evils"
954,S. LXXXVI.,comparatively distant and alien.
955,S. LXXXVI.,
956,S. LXXXVI.,Indignation at literary wrongs I leave to men born under happier stars.
957,S. LXXXVI.,"I cannot afford it. But so far from condemning those who can, I deem"
958,S. LXXXVI.,"it a writer’s duty, and think it creditable to his heart, to feel and"
959,S. LXXXVI.,"express a resentment proportioned to the grossness of the provocation,"
960,S. LXXXVI.,"and the importance of the object. There is no profession on earth, which"
961,S. LXXXVI.,"requires an attention so early, so long, or so unintermitting as that of"
962,S. LXXXVI.,"poetry; and indeed as that of literary composition in general, if it be"
963,S. LXXXVI.,such as at all satisfies the demands both of taste and of sound logic.
964,S. LXXXVI.,"How difficult and delicate a task even the mere mechanism of verse is,"
965,S. LXXXVI.,"may be conjectured from the failure of those, who have attempted poetry"
966,S. LXXXVI.,"late in life. Where then a man has, from his earliest youth, devoted"
967,S. LXXXVI.,"his whole being to an object, which by the admission of all civilized"
968,S. LXXXVI.,"nations in all ages is honourable as a pursuit, and glorious as an"
969,S. LXXXVI.,"attainment; what of all that relates to himself and his family, if only"
970,S. LXXXVI.,"we except his moral character, can have fairer claims to his protection,"
971,S. LXXXVI.,"or more authorize acts of self-defence, than the elaborate products of"
972,S. LXXXVI.,his intellect and intellectual industry? Prudence itself would command
973,S. LXXXVI.,"us to show, even if defect or diversion of natural sensibility had"
974,S. LXXXVI.,"prevented us from feeling, a due interest and qualified anxiety for the"
975,S. LXXXVI.,"offspring and representatives of our nobler being. I know it, alas! by"
976,S. LXXXVI.,woful experience. I have laid too many eggs in the hot sands of this
977,S. LXXXVI.,"wilderness, the world, with ostrich carelessness and ostrich oblivion."
978,S. LXXXVI.,"The greater part indeed have been trod under foot, and are forgotten;"
979,S. LXXXVI.,"but yet no small number have crept forth into life, some to furnish"
980,S. LXXXVI.,"feathers for the caps of others, and still more to plume the shafts in"
981,S. LXXXVI.,"the quivers of my enemies, of them that unprovoked have lain in wait"
982,S. LXXXVI.,against my soul.

995,CHAPTER III,

997,CHAPTER III,"name and rank, and to satirists with or without a name in verse or"
998,CHAPTER III,"prose, or in verse-text aided by prose-comment, I do seriously believe"
999,CHAPTER III,"and profess, that I owe full two-thirds of whatever reputation and"
1000,CHAPTER III,publicity I happen to possess. For when the name of an individual has
1001,CHAPTER III,"occurred so frequently, in so many works, for so great a length of time,"
1002,CHAPTER III,"the readers of these works--(which with a shelf or two of beauties,"
1003,CHAPTER III,"elegant Extracts and Anas, form nine-tenths of the reading of the"
1004,CHAPTER III,"reading Public [14])--cannot but be familiar with the name, without"
1005,CHAPTER III,distinctly remembering whether it was introduced for eulogy or for
1006,CHAPTER III,"censure. And this becomes the more likely, if (as I believe) the"
1007,CHAPTER III,habit of perusing periodical works may be properly added to Averroes’
1008,CHAPTER III,"catalogue of Anti-Mnemonics, or weakeners of the memory [15]. But where"
1009,CHAPTER III,"this has not been the case, yet the reader will be apt to suspect that"
1010,CHAPTER III,there must be something more than usually strong and extensive in
1011,CHAPTER III,"a reputation, that could either require or stand so merciless"
1012,CHAPTER III,and long-continued a cannonading. Without any feeling of anger
1013,CHAPTER III,"therefore--(for which indeed, on my own account, I have no pretext)--I"
1014,CHAPTER III,"may yet be allowed to express some degree of surprise, that, after"
1015,CHAPTER III,having run the critical gauntlet for a certain class of faults which
1016,CHAPTER III,"I had, nothing having come before the judgment-seat in the interim, I"
1017,CHAPTER III,"should, year after year, quarter after quarter, month after month--(not"
1018,CHAPTER III,"to mention sundry petty periodicals of still quicker revolution,"
1019,CHAPTER III,"“or weekly or diurnal”)--have been, for at least seventeen years"
1020,CHAPTER III,"consecutively, dragged forth by them into the foremost ranks of the"
1021,CHAPTER III,"proscribed, and forced to abide the brunt of abuse, for faults directly"
1022,CHAPTER III,"opposite, and which I certainly had not. How shall I explain this?"
1023,CHAPTER III,
1024,CHAPTER III,"Whatever may have been the case with others, I certainly cannot"
1025,CHAPTER III,"attribute this persecution to personal dislike, or to envy, or to"
1026,CHAPTER III,"feelings of vindictive animosity. Not to the former, for with the"
1027,CHAPTER III,"exception of a very few who are my intimate friends, and were so before"
1028,CHAPTER III,"they were known as authors, I have had little other acquaintance"
1029,CHAPTER III,"with literary characters, than what may be implied in an accidental"
1030,CHAPTER III,"introduction, or casual meeting in a mixed company. And as far as words"
1031,CHAPTER III,"and looks can be trusted, I must believe that, even in these instances,"
1032,CHAPTER III,"I had excited no unfriendly disposition. Neither by letter, nor in"
1033,CHAPTER III,"conversation, have I ever had dispute or controversy beyond the common"
1034,CHAPTER III,"social interchange of opinions. Nay, where I had reason to suppose my"
1035,CHAPTER III,"convictions fundamentally different, it has been my habit, and I may"
1036,CHAPTER III,"add, the impulse of my nature, to assign the grounds of my belief,"
1037,CHAPTER III,"rather than the belief itself; and not to express dissent, till I could"
1038,CHAPTER III,"establish some points of complete sympathy, some grounds common to both"
1039,CHAPTER III,"sides, from which to commence its explanation."
1040,CHAPTER III,
1041,CHAPTER III,Still less can I place these attacks to the charge of envy. The few
1042,CHAPTER III,"pages which I have published, are of too distant a date, and the extent"
1043,CHAPTER III,of their sale a proof too conclusive against their having been popular
1044,CHAPTER III,"at any time, to render probable, I had almost said possible, the"
1045,CHAPTER III,excitement of envy on their account; and the man who should envy me on
1046,CHAPTER III,"any other, verily he must be envy-mad!"
1047,CHAPTER III,
1048,CHAPTER III,"Lastly, with as little semblance of reason, could I suspect any"
1049,CHAPTER III,animosity towards me from vindictive feelings as the cause. I have
1050,CHAPTER III,"before said, that my acquaintance with literary men has been limited and"
1051,CHAPTER III,distant; and that I have had neither dispute nor controversy. From my
1052,CHAPTER III,"first entrance into life, I have, with few and short intervals, lived"
1053,CHAPTER III,either abroad or in retirement. My different essays on subjects of
1054,CHAPTER III,"national interest, published at different times, first in the Morning"
1055,CHAPTER III,"Post and then in the Courier, with my courses of Lectures on the"
1056,CHAPTER III,"principles of criticism as applied to Shakespeare and Milton, constitute"
1057,CHAPTER III,my whole publicity; the only occasions on which I could offend any
1058,CHAPTER III,member of the republic of letters. With one solitary exception in
1059,CHAPTER III,which my words were first misstated and then wantonly applied to an
1060,CHAPTER III,"individual, I could never learn that I had excited the displeasure of"
1061,CHAPTER III,any among my literary contemporaries. Having announced my intention to
1062,CHAPTER III,give a course of Lectures on the characteristic merits and defects of
1063,CHAPTER III,"English poetry in its different aeras; first, from Chaucer to Milton;"
1064,CHAPTER III,"second, from Dryden inclusively to Thomson; and third, from Cowper to"
1065,CHAPTER III,"the present day; I changed my plan, and confined my disquisition to the"
1066,CHAPTER III,"former two periods, that I might furnish no possible pretext for the"
1067,CHAPTER III,"unthinking to misconstrue, or the malignant to misapply my words, and"
1068,CHAPTER III,"having stamped their own meaning on them, to pass them as current coin"
1069,CHAPTER III,in the marts of garrulity or detraction.
1070,CHAPTER III,
1071,CHAPTER III,Praises of the unworthy are felt by ardent minds as robberies of the
1072,CHAPTER III,"deserving; and it is too true, and too frequent, that Bacon, Harrington,"
1073,CHAPTER III,"Machiavel, and Spinoza, are not read, because Hume, Condillac, and"
1074,CHAPTER III,Voltaire are. But in promiscuous company no prudent man will oppugn
1075,CHAPTER III,the merits of a contemporary in his own supposed department; contenting
1076,CHAPTER III,himself with praising in his turn those whom he deems excellent. If
1077,CHAPTER III,I should ever deem it my duty at all to oppose the pretensions of
1078,CHAPTER III,"individuals, I would oppose them in books which could be weighed and"
1079,CHAPTER III,"answered, in which I could evolve the whole of my reasons and feelings,"
1080,CHAPTER III,with their requisite limits and modifications; not in irrecoverable
1081,CHAPTER III,"conversation, where however strong the reasons might be, the feelings"
1082,CHAPTER III,that prompted them would assuredly be attributed by some one or other
1083,CHAPTER III,"to envy and discontent. Besides I well know, and, I trust, have acted on"
1084,CHAPTER III,"that knowledge, that it must be the ignorant and injudicious who extol"
1085,CHAPTER III,the unworthy; and the eulogies of critics without taste or judgment are
1086,CHAPTER III,the natural reward of authors without feeling or genius. Sint unicuique
1087,CHAPTER III,sua praemia.
1088,CHAPTER III,
1089,CHAPTER III,"How then, dismissing, as I do, these three causes, am I to account for"
1090,CHAPTER III,"attacks, the long continuance and inveteracy of which it would require"
1091,CHAPTER III,"all three to explain? The solution seems to be this,--I was in habits of"
1092,CHAPTER III,"intimacy with Mr. Wordsworth and Mr. Southey! This, however, transfers,"
1093,CHAPTER III,"rather than removes the difficulty. Be it, that, by an unconscionable"
1094,CHAPTER III,"extension of the old adage, noscitur a socio, my literary friends are"
1095,CHAPTER III,"never under the water-fall of criticism, but I must be wet through with"
1096,CHAPTER III,the spray; yet how came the torrent to descend upon them?
1097,CHAPTER III,
1098,CHAPTER III,"First then, with regard to Mr. Southey. I well remember the general"
1099,CHAPTER III,"reception of his earlier publications; namely, the poems published with"
1100,CHAPTER III,Mr. Lovell under the names of Moschus and Bion; the two volumes of poems
1101,CHAPTER III,"under his own name, and the Joan of Arc. The censures of the critics by"
1102,CHAPTER III,"profession are extant, and may be easily referred to:--careless lines,"
1103,CHAPTER III,"inequality in the merit of the different poems, and (in the lighter"
1104,CHAPTER III,"works) a predilection for the strange and whimsical; in short, such"
1105,CHAPTER III,"faults as might have been anticipated in a young and rapid writer, were"
1106,CHAPTER III,indeed sufficiently enforced. Nor was there at that time wanting a party
1107,CHAPTER III,"spirit to aggravate the defects of a poet, who with all the courage of"
1108,CHAPTER III,"uncorrupted youth had avowed his zeal for a cause, which he deemed"
1109,CHAPTER III,"that of liberty, and his abhorrence of oppression by whatever name"
1110,CHAPTER III,"consecrated. But it was as little objected by others, as dreamed of by"
1111,CHAPTER III,"the poet himself, that he preferred careless and prosaic lines on rule"
1112,CHAPTER III,"and of forethought, or indeed that he pretended to any other art or"
1113,CHAPTER III,"theory of poetic diction, except that which we may all learn from"
1114,CHAPTER III,"Horace, Quinctilian, the admirable dialogue, De Oratoribus, generally"
1115,CHAPTER III,"attributed to Tacitus, or Strada’s Prolusions; if indeed natural good"
1116,CHAPTER III,sense and the early study of the best models in his own language had
1117,CHAPTER III,"not infused the same maxims more securely, and, if I may venture the"
1118,CHAPTER III,"expression, more vitally. All that could have been fairly deduced was,"
1119,CHAPTER III,that in his taste and estimation of writers Mr. Southey agreed far more
1120,CHAPTER III,"with Thomas Warton, than with Dr. Johnson. Nor do I mean to deny, that"
1121,CHAPTER III,at all times Mr. Southey was of the same mind with Sir Philip Sidney in
1122,CHAPTER III,preferring an excellent ballad in the humblest style of poetry to twenty
1123,CHAPTER III,indifferent poems that strutted in the highest. And by what have his
1124,CHAPTER III,"works, published since then, been characterized, each more strikingly"
1125,CHAPTER III,"than the preceding, but by greater splendour, a deeper pathos,"
1126,CHAPTER III,"profounder reflections, and a more sustained dignity of language and of"
1127,CHAPTER III,"metre? Distant may the period be, but whenever the time shall come,"
1128,CHAPTER III,when all his works shall be collected by some editor worthy to be his
1129,CHAPTER III,"biographer, I trust that an appendix of excerpta of all the passages,"
1130,CHAPTER III,"in which his writings, name, and character have been attacked, from"
1131,CHAPTER III,"the pamphlets and periodical works of the last twenty years, may be an"
1132,CHAPTER III,accompaniment. Yet that it would prove medicinal in after times I dare
1133,CHAPTER III,"not hope; for as long as there are readers to be delighted with calumny,"
1134,CHAPTER III,there will be found reviewers to calumniate. And such readers will
1135,CHAPTER III,"become in all probability more numerous, in proportion as a still"
1136,CHAPTER III,"greater diffusion of literature shall produce an increase of sciolists,"
1137,CHAPTER III,"and sciolism bring with it petulance and presumption. In times of old,"
1138,CHAPTER III,"books were as religious oracles; as literature advanced, they next"
1139,CHAPTER III,became venerable preceptors; they then descended to the rank of
1140,CHAPTER III,"instructive friends; and, as their numbers increased, they sank still"
1141,CHAPTER III,lower to that of entertaining companions; and at present they seem
1142,CHAPTER III,degraded into culprits to hold up their hands at the bar of every
1143,CHAPTER III,"self-elected, yet not the less peremptory, judge, who chooses to write"
1144,CHAPTER III,"from humour or interest, from enmity or arrogance, and to abide the"
1145,CHAPTER III,"decision “of him that reads in malice, or him that reads after dinner.”"
1146,CHAPTER III,
1147,CHAPTER III,"The same retrograde movement may be traced, in the relation which the"
1148,CHAPTER III,authors themselves have assumed towards their readers. From the lofty
1149,CHAPTER III,"address of Bacon: “these are the meditations of Francis of Verulam,"
1150,CHAPTER III,"which that posterity should be possessed of, he deemed their interest:”"
1151,CHAPTER III,"or from dedication to Monarch or Pontiff, in which the honour given was"
1152,CHAPTER III,asserted in equipoise to the patronage acknowledged: from Pindar’s

1163,CHAPTER III,
1164,CHAPTER III,there was a gradual sinking in the etiquette or allowed style of
1165,CHAPTER III,pretension.
1166,CHAPTER III,
1167,CHAPTER III,"Poets and Philosophers, rendered diffident by their very number,"
1168,CHAPTER III,addressed themselves to “learned readers;” then aimed to conciliate
1169,CHAPTER III,"the graces of “the candid reader;” till, the critic still rising as the"
1170,CHAPTER III,"author sank, the amateurs of literature collectively were erected into a"
1171,CHAPTER III,"municipality of judges, and addressed as the Town! And now, finally,"
1172,CHAPTER III,"all men being supposed able to read, and all readers able to judge,"
1173,CHAPTER III,"the multitudinous Public, shaped into personal unity by the magic of"
1174,CHAPTER III,"abstraction, sits nominal despot on the throne of criticism. But, alas!"
1175,CHAPTER III,"as in other despotisms, it but echoes the decisions of its invisible"
1176,CHAPTER III,"ministers, whose intellectual claims to the guardianship of the Muses"
1177,CHAPTER III,"seem, for the greater part, analogous to the physical qualifications"
1178,CHAPTER III,which adapt their oriental brethren for the superintendence of the
1179,CHAPTER III,"Harem. Thus it is said, that St. Nepomuc was installed the guardian of"
1180,CHAPTER III,"bridges, because he had fallen over one, and sunk out of sight; thus"
1181,CHAPTER III,"too St. Cecilia is said to have been first propitiated by musicians,"
1182,CHAPTER III,"because, having failed in her own attempts, she had taken a dislike to"
1183,CHAPTER III,the art and all its successful professors. But I shall probably have
1184,CHAPTER III,occasion hereafter to deliver my convictions more at large concerning
1185,CHAPTER III,"this state of things, and its influences on taste, genius and morality."
1186,CHAPTER III,
1187,CHAPTER III,"In the Thalaba, the Madoc, and still more evidently in the unique [16]"
1188,CHAPTER III,"Cid, in the Kehama, and, as last, so best, the Roderick; Southey has"
1189,CHAPTER III,"given abundant proof, se cogitare quam sit magnum dare aliquid in manus"
1190,CHAPTER III,"hominum: nec persuadere sibi posse, non saepe tractandum quod placere"
1191,CHAPTER III,"et semper et omnibus cupiat. But on the other hand, I conceive, that Mr."
1192,CHAPTER III,"Southey was quite unable to comprehend, wherein could consist the crime"
1193,CHAPTER III,or mischief of printing half a dozen or more playful poems; or to speak
1194,CHAPTER III,"more generally, compositions which would be enjoyed or passed over,"
1195,CHAPTER III,according as the taste and humour of the reader might chance to be;
1196,CHAPTER III,provided they contained nothing immoral. In the present age periturae
1197,CHAPTER III,parcere chartae is emphatically an unreasonable demand. The merest
1198,CHAPTER III,trifle he ever sent abroad had tenfold better claims to its ink and
1199,CHAPTER III,"paper than all the silly criticisms on it, which proved no more than"
1200,CHAPTER III,"that the critic was not one of those, for whom the trifle was written;"
1201,CHAPTER III,and than all the grave exhortations to a greater reverence for the
1202,CHAPTER III,"public--as if the passive page of a book, by having an epigram or"
1203,CHAPTER III,"doggerel tale impressed on it, instantly assumed at once loco-motive"
1204,CHAPTER III,"power and a sort of ubiquity, so as to flutter and buz in the ear of the"
1205,CHAPTER III,public to the sore annoyance of the said mysterious personage. But what
1206,CHAPTER III,gives an additional and more ludicrous absurdity to these lamentations
1207,CHAPTER III,"is the curious fact, that if in a volume of poetry the critic should"
1208,CHAPTER III,"find poem or passage which he deems more especially worthless, he"
1209,CHAPTER III,"is sure to select and reprint it in the review; by which, on his own"
1210,CHAPTER III,"grounds, he wastes as much more paper than the author, as the copies of"
1211,CHAPTER III,a fashionable review are more numerous than those of the original book;
1212,CHAPTER III,"in some, and those the most prominent instances, as ten thousand to five"
1213,CHAPTER III,hundred. I know nothing that surpasses the vileness of deciding on the
1214,CHAPTER III,"merits of a poet or painter,--(not by characteristic defects; for where"
1215,CHAPTER III,"there is genius, these always point to his characteristic beauties;"
1216,CHAPTER III,but)--by accidental failures or faulty passages; except the impudence
1217,CHAPTER III,"of defending it, as the proper duty, and most instructive part, of"
1218,CHAPTER III,"criticism. Omit or pass slightly over the expression, grace,"
1219,CHAPTER III,and grouping of Raffael’s figures; but ridicule in detail the
1220,CHAPTER III,"knitting-needles and broom-twigs, that are to represent trees in his"
1221,CHAPTER III,back grounds; and never let him hear the last of his galli-pots! Admit
1222,CHAPTER III,that the Allegro and Penseroso of Milton are not without merit; but
1223,CHAPTER III,"repay yourself for this concession, by reprinting at length the two"
1224,CHAPTER III,"poems on the University Carrier! As a fair specimen of his Sonnets,"
1225,CHAPTER III,quote
1226,CHAPTER III,
1227,CHAPTER III,“A Book was writ of late called Tetrachordon;”
1228,CHAPTER III,
1229,CHAPTER III,"and, as characteristic of his rhythm and metre, cite his literal"
1230,CHAPTER III,"translation of the first and second Psalm! In order to justify yourself,"
1231,CHAPTER III,"you need only assert, that had you dwelt chiefly on the beauties and"
1232,CHAPTER III,"excellencies of the poet, the admiration of these might seduce the"
1233,CHAPTER III,"attention of future writers from the objects of their love and wonder,"
1234,CHAPTER III,to an imitation of the few poems and passages in which the poet was most
1235,CHAPTER III,unlike himself.
1236,CHAPTER III,
1237,CHAPTER III,"But till reviews are conducted on far other principles, and with far"
1238,CHAPTER III,other motives; till in the place of arbitrary dictation and petulant
1239,CHAPTER III,"sneers, the reviewers support their decisions by reference to fixed"
1240,CHAPTER III,"canons of criticism, previously established and deduced from the nature"
1241,CHAPTER III,of man; reflecting minds will pronounce it arrogance in them thus to
1242,CHAPTER III,"announce themselves to men of letters, as the guides of their taste"
1243,CHAPTER III,"and judgment. To the purchaser and mere reader it is, at all events, an"
1244,CHAPTER III,"injustice. He who tells me that there are defects in a new work,"
1245,CHAPTER III,tells me nothing which I should not have taken for granted without his
1246,CHAPTER III,"information. But he, who points out and elucidates the beauties of"
1247,CHAPTER III,"an original work does indeed give me interesting information, such"
1248,CHAPTER III,as experience would not have authorized me in anticipating. And as to
1249,CHAPTER III,compositions which the authors themselves announce with
1250,CHAPTER III,
1251,CHAPTER III,"Haec ipsi novimus esse nihil,"
1252,CHAPTER III,
1253,CHAPTER III,"why should we judge by a different rule two printed works, only because"
1254,CHAPTER III,"the one author is alive, and the other in his grave? What literary man"
1255,CHAPTER III,has not regretted the prudery of Spratt in refusing to let his friend
1256,CHAPTER III,Cowley appear in his slippers and dressing gown? I am not perhaps
1257,CHAPTER III,"the only one who has derived an innocent amusement from the riddles,"
1258,CHAPTER III,"conundrums, tri-syllable lines, and the like, of Swift and his"
1259,CHAPTER III,"correspondents, in hours of languor, when to have read his more finished"
1260,CHAPTER III,"works would have been useless to myself, and, in some sort, an act"
1261,CHAPTER III,of injustice to the author. But I am at a loss to conceive by what
1262,CHAPTER III,"perversity of judgment, these relaxations of his genius could be"
1263,CHAPTER III,"employed to diminish his fame as the writer of Gulliver, or the Tale of"
1264,CHAPTER III,"a Tub. Had Mr. Southey written twice as many poems of inferior merit, or"
1265,CHAPTER III,"partial interest, as have enlivened the journals of the day, they"
1266,CHAPTER III,"would have added to his honour with good and wise men, not merely or"
1267,CHAPTER III,"principally as proving the versatility of his talents, but as evidences"
1268,CHAPTER III,"of the purity of that mind, which even in its levities never dictated a"
1269,CHAPTER III,line which it need regret on any moral account.
1270,CHAPTER III,
1271,CHAPTER III,I have in imagination transferred to the future biographer the duty of
1272,CHAPTER III,"contrasting Southey’s fixed and well-earned fame, with the abuse and"
1273,CHAPTER III,indefatigable hostility of his anonymous critics from his early youth to
1274,CHAPTER III,his ripest manhood. But I cannot think so ill of human nature as not
1275,CHAPTER III,"to believe, that these critics have already taken shame to themselves,"
1276,CHAPTER III,whether they consider the object of their abuse in his moral or his
1277,CHAPTER III,literary character. For reflect but on the variety and extent of his
1278,CHAPTER III,"acquirements! He stands second to no man, either as an historian or as"
1279,CHAPTER III,"a bibliographer; and when I regard him as a popular essayist,--(for the"
1280,CHAPTER III,"articles of his compositions in the reviews are, for the greater part,"
1281,CHAPTER III,essays on subjects of deep or curious interest rather than criticisms
1282,CHAPTER III,"on particular works)--I look in vain for any writer, who has conveyed so"
1283,CHAPTER III,"much information, from so many and such recondite sources, with so many"
1284,CHAPTER III,"just and original reflections, in a style so lively and poignant, yet so"
1285,CHAPTER III,"uniformly classical and perspicuous; no one, in short, who has combined"
1286,CHAPTER III,so much wisdom with so much wit; so much truth and knowledge with
1287,CHAPTER III,so much life and fancy. His prose is always intelligible and always
1288,CHAPTER III,entertaining. In poetry he has attempted almost every species of
1289,CHAPTER III,"composition known before, and he has added new ones; and if we except"
1290,CHAPTER III,"the highest lyric,--(in which how few, how very few even of the greatest"
1291,CHAPTER III,minds have been fortunate)--he has attempted every species successfully;
1292,CHAPTER III,"from the political song of the day, thrown off in the playful overflow"
1293,CHAPTER III,"of honest joy and patriotic exultation, to the wild ballad; from"
1294,CHAPTER III,"epistolary ease and graceful narrative, to austere and impetuous moral"
1295,CHAPTER III,declamation; from the pastoral charms and wild streaming lights of the
1296,CHAPTER III,"Thalaba, in which sentiment and imagery have given permanence even to"
1297,CHAPTER III,"the excitement of curiosity; and from the full blaze of the Kehama,--(a"
1298,CHAPTER III,"gallery of finished pictures in one splendid fancy piece, in which,"
1299,CHAPTER III,"notwithstanding, the moral grandeur rises gradually above the brilliance"
1300,CHAPTER III,of the colouring and the boldness and novelty of the machinery)--to
1301,CHAPTER III,"the more sober beauties of the Madoc; and lastly, from the Madoc to"
1302,CHAPTER III,"his Roderick, in which, retaining all his former excellencies of a"
1303,CHAPTER III,"poet eminently inventive and picturesque, he has surpassed himself"
1304,CHAPTER III,"in language and metre, in the construction of the whole, and in the"
1305,CHAPTER III,splendour of particular passages.
1306,CHAPTER III,
1307,CHAPTER III,"Here then shall I conclude? No! The characters of the deceased, like the"
1308,CHAPTER III,"encomia on tombstones, as they are described with religious tenderness,"
1309,CHAPTER III,"so are they read, with allowing sympathy indeed, but yet with rational"
1310,CHAPTER III,"deduction. There are men, who deserve a higher record; men with whose"
1311,CHAPTER III,"characters it is the interest of their contemporaries, no less than"
1312,CHAPTER III,"that of posterity, to be made acquainted; while it is yet possible for"
1313,CHAPTER III,"impartial censure, and even for quick-sighted envy, to cross-examine"
1314,CHAPTER III,the tale without offence to the courtesies of humanity; and while the
1315,CHAPTER III,"eulogist, detected in exaggeration or falsehood, must pay the full"
1316,CHAPTER III,penalty of his baseness in the contempt which brands the convicted
1317,CHAPTER III,"flatterer. Publicly has Mr. Southey been reviled by men, who, as I would"
1318,CHAPTER III,"fain hope for the honour of human nature, hurled fire-brands against"
1319,CHAPTER III,a figure of their own imagination; publicly have his talents been
1320,CHAPTER III,"depreciated, his principles denounced; as publicly do I therefore, who"
1321,CHAPTER III,"have known him intimately, deem it my duty to leave recorded, that it"
1322,CHAPTER III,"is Southey’s almost unexampled felicity, to possess the best gifts of"
1323,CHAPTER III,talent and genius free from all their characteristic defects. To those
1324,CHAPTER III,who remember the state of our public schools and universities some
1325,CHAPTER III,"twenty years past, it will appear no ordinary praise in any man to have"
1326,CHAPTER III,"passed from innocence into virtue, not only free from all vicious habit,"
1327,CHAPTER III,"but unstained by one act of intemperance, or the degradations akin to"
1328,CHAPTER III,"intemperance. That scheme of head, heart, and habitual demeanour, which"
1329,CHAPTER III,"in his early manhood, and first controversial writings, Milton, claiming"
1330,CHAPTER III,"the privilege of self-defence, asserts of himself, and challenges"
1331,CHAPTER III,"his calumniators to disprove; this will his school-mates, his"
1332,CHAPTER III,"fellow-collegians, and his maturer friends, with a confidence"
1333,CHAPTER III,"proportioned to the intimacy of their knowledge, bear witness to, as"
1334,CHAPTER III,again realized in the life of Robert Southey. But still more striking to
1335,CHAPTER III,"those, who by biography or by their own experience are familiar with the"
1336,CHAPTER III,"general habits of genius, will appear the poet’s matchless industry"
1337,CHAPTER III,and perseverance in his pursuits; the worthiness and dignity of those
1338,CHAPTER III,"pursuits; his generous submission to tasks of transitory interest, or"
1339,CHAPTER III,such as his genius alone could make otherwise; and that having thus more
1340,CHAPTER III,"than satisfied the claims of affection or prudence, he should yet have"
1341,CHAPTER III,"made for himself time and power, to achieve more, and in more various"
1342,CHAPTER III,"departments, than almost any other writer has done, though employed"
1343,CHAPTER III,wholly on subjects of his own choice and ambition. But as Southey
1344,CHAPTER III,"possesses, and is not possessed by, his genius, even so is he master"
1345,CHAPTER III,even of his virtues. The regular and methodical tenor of his daily
1346,CHAPTER III,"labours, which would be deemed rare in the most mechanical pursuits,"
1347,CHAPTER III,"and might be envied by the mere man of business, loses all semblance of"
1348,CHAPTER III,"formality in the dignified simplicity of his manners, in the spring and"
1349,CHAPTER III,"healthful cheerfulness of his spirits. Always employed, his friends find"
1350,CHAPTER III,"him always at leisure. No less punctual in trifles, than steadfast in"
1351,CHAPTER III,"the performance of highest duties, he inflicts none of those small pains"
1352,CHAPTER III,"and discomforts which irregular men scatter about them, and which in"
1353,CHAPTER III,the aggregate so often become formidable obstacles both to happiness
1354,CHAPTER III,"and utility; while on the contrary he bestows all the pleasures, and"
1355,CHAPTER III,inspires all that ease of mind on those around him or connected with
1356,CHAPTER III,"him, which perfect consistency, and (if such a word might be framed)"
1357,CHAPTER III,"absolute reliability, equally in small as in great concerns, cannot but"
1358,CHAPTER III,inspire and bestow; when this too is softened without being weakened
1359,CHAPTER III,by kindness and gentleness. I know few men who so well deserve the
1360,CHAPTER III,"character which an antient attributes to Marcus Cato, namely, that"
1361,CHAPTER III,"he was likest virtue, in as much as he seemed to act aright, not in"
1362,CHAPTER III,"obedience to any law or outward motive, but by the necessity of a happy"
1363,CHAPTER III,"nature, which could not act otherwise. As son, brother, husband,"
1364,CHAPTER III,"father, master, friend, he moves with firm yet light steps, alike"
1365,CHAPTER III,"unostentatious, and alike exemplary. As a writer, he has uniformly made"
1366,CHAPTER III,"his talents subservient to the best interests of humanity, of public"
1367,CHAPTER III,"virtue, and domestic piety; his cause has ever been the cause of pure"
1368,CHAPTER III,"religion and of liberty, of national independence and of national"
1369,CHAPTER III,illumination. When future critics shall weigh out his guerdon of praise
1370,CHAPTER III,"and censure, it will be Southey the poet only, that will supply them"
1371,CHAPTER III,with the scanty materials for the latter. They will likewise not fail to
1372,CHAPTER III,"record, that as no man was ever a more constant friend, never had poet"
1373,CHAPTER III,more friends and honourers among the good of all parties; and that
1374,CHAPTER III,"quacks in education, quacks in politics, and quacks in criticism were"
1375,CHAPTER III,his only enemies. [17]

1395,CHAPTER IV,As little do I believe that Mr. Wordsworth’s Lyrical Ballads were
1396,CHAPTER IV,in themselves the cause. I speak exclusively of the two volumes so
1397,CHAPTER IV,entitled. A careful and repeated examination of these confirms me in
1398,CHAPTER IV,"the belief, that the omission of less than a hundred lines would have"
1399,CHAPTER IV,precluded nine-tenths of the criticism on this work. I hazard this
1400,CHAPTER IV,"declaration, however, on the supposition, that the reader has taken it"
1401,CHAPTER IV,"up, as he would have done any other collection of poems purporting to"
1402,CHAPTER IV,derive their subjects or interests from the incidents of domestic or
1403,CHAPTER IV,"ordinary life, intermingled with higher strains of meditation which"
1404,CHAPTER IV,"the poet utters in his own person and character; with the proviso, that"
1405,CHAPTER IV,"these poems were perused without knowledge of, or reference to,"
1406,CHAPTER IV,"the author’s peculiar opinions, and that the reader had not had his"
1407,CHAPTER IV,"attention previously directed to those peculiarities. In that case,"
1408,CHAPTER IV,"as actually happened with Mr. Southey’s earlier works, the lines and"
1409,CHAPTER IV,"passages which might have offended the general taste, would have been"
1410,CHAPTER IV,"considered as mere inequalities, and attributed to inattention, not to"
1411,CHAPTER IV,perversity of judgment. The men of business who had passed their lives
1412,CHAPTER IV,"chiefly in cities, and who might therefore be expected to derive the"
1413,CHAPTER IV,"highest pleasure from acute notices of men and manners conveyed in easy,"
1414,CHAPTER IV,"yet correct and pointed language; and all those who, reading but little"
1415,CHAPTER IV,"poetry, are most stimulated with that species of it, which seems"
1416,CHAPTER IV,"most distant from prose, would probably have passed by the volumes"
1417,CHAPTER IV,"altogether. Others more catholic in their taste, and yet habituated to"
1418,CHAPTER IV,"be most pleased when most excited, would have contented themselves"
1419,CHAPTER IV,"with deciding, that the author had been successful in proportion to the"
1420,CHAPTER IV,"elevation of his style and subject. Not a few, perhaps, might, by their"
1421,CHAPTER IV,"admiration of the Lines written near Tintern Abbey, on revisiting the"
1422,CHAPTER IV,"Wye, those Left upon a Yew Tree Seat, The Old Cumberland Beggar,"
1423,CHAPTER IV,"and Ruth, have been gradually led to peruse with kindred feeling"
1424,CHAPTER IV,"The Brothers, the Hart-leap Well, and whatever other poems in that"
1425,CHAPTER IV,collection may be described as holding a middle place between those
1426,CHAPTER IV,written in the highest and those in the humblest style; as for instance
1427,CHAPTER IV,"between the Tintern Abbey, and The Thorn, or Simon Lee. Should their"
1428,CHAPTER IV,"taste submit to no further change, and still remain unreconciled to the"
1429,CHAPTER IV,"colloquial phrases, or the imitations of them, that are, more or less,"
1430,CHAPTER IV,scattered through the class last mentioned; yet even from the small
1431,CHAPTER IV,"number of the latter, they would have deemed them but an inconsiderable"
1432,CHAPTER IV,"subtraction from the merit of the whole work; or, what is sometimes not"
1433,CHAPTER IV,"unpleasing in the publication of a new writer, as serving to ascertain"
1434,CHAPTER IV,"the natural tendency, and consequently the proper direction of the"
1435,CHAPTER IV,author’s genius.
1436,CHAPTER IV,
1437,CHAPTER IV,"In the critical remarks, therefore, prefixed and annexed to the Lyrical"
1438,CHAPTER IV,"Ballads, I believe, we may safely rest, as the true origin of the"
1439,CHAPTER IV,unexampled opposition which Mr. Wordsworth’s writings have been since
1440,CHAPTER IV,doomed to encounter. The humbler passages in the poems themselves were
1441,CHAPTER IV,dwelt on and cited to justify the rejection of the theory. What in
1442,CHAPTER IV,and for themselves would have been either forgotten or forgiven as
1443,CHAPTER IV,"imperfections, or at least comparative failures, provoked direct"
1444,CHAPTER IV,"hostility when announced as intentional, as the result of choice after"
1445,CHAPTER IV,"full deliberation. Thus the poems, admitted by all as excellent, joined"
1446,CHAPTER IV,"with those which had pleased the far greater number, though they formed"
1447,CHAPTER IV,"two-thirds of the whole work, instead of being deemed (as in all right"
1448,CHAPTER IV,"they should have been, even if we take for granted that the reader"
1449,CHAPTER IV,"judged aright) an atonement for the few exceptions, gave wind and fuel"
1450,CHAPTER IV,to the animosity against both the poems and the poet. In all perplexity
1451,CHAPTER IV,"there is a portion of fear, which predisposes the mind to anger. Not"
1452,CHAPTER IV,able to deny that the author possessed both genius and a powerful
1453,CHAPTER IV,"intellect, they felt very positive,--but yet were not quite certain"
1454,CHAPTER IV,"that he might not be in the right, and they themselves in the wrong; an"
1455,CHAPTER IV,"unquiet state of mind, which seeks alleviation by quarrelling with the"
1456,CHAPTER IV,"occasion of it, and by wondering at the perverseness of the man, who had"
1457,CHAPTER IV,"written a long and argumentative essay to persuade them, that"
1458,CHAPTER IV,
1459,CHAPTER IV,"Fair is foul, and foul is fair;"
1460,CHAPTER IV,
1461,CHAPTER IV,"in other words, that they had been all their lives admiring without"
1462,CHAPTER IV,"judgment, and were now about to censure without reason. [18]"
1463,CHAPTER IV,
1464,CHAPTER IV,"That this conjecture is not wide from the mark, I am induced to believe"
1465,CHAPTER IV,"from the noticeable fact, which I can state on my own knowledge, that"
1466,CHAPTER IV,the same general censure has been grounded by almost every different
1467,CHAPTER IV,"person on some different poem. Among those, whose candour and judgment"
1468,CHAPTER IV,"I estimate highly, I distinctly remember six who expressed their"
1469,CHAPTER IV,"objections to the Lyrical Ballads almost in the same words, and"
1470,CHAPTER IV,"altogether to the same purport, at the same time admitting, that several"
1471,CHAPTER IV,"of the poems had given them great pleasure; and, strange as it might"
1472,CHAPTER IV,"seem, the composition which one cited as execrable, another quoted as"
1473,CHAPTER IV,"his favourite. I am indeed convinced in my own mind, that could the same"
1474,CHAPTER IV,"experiment have been tried with these volumes, as was made in the well"
1475,CHAPTER IV,"known story of the picture, the result would have been the same; the"
1476,CHAPTER IV,"parts which had been covered by black spots on the one day, would be"
1477,CHAPTER IV,found equally albo lapide notatae on the succeeding.
1478,CHAPTER IV,
1479,CHAPTER IV,"However this may be, it was assuredly hard and unjust to fix the"
1480,CHAPTER IV,"attention on a few separate and insulated poems with as much aversion,"
1481,CHAPTER IV,"as if they had been so many plague-spots on the whole work, instead of"
1482,CHAPTER IV,"passing them over in silence, as so much blank paper, or leaves of a"
1483,CHAPTER IV,"bookseller’s catalogue; especially, as no one pretended to have found"
1484,CHAPTER IV,"in them any immorality or indelicacy; and the poems, therefore, at the"
1485,CHAPTER IV,"worst, could only be regarded as so many light or inferior coins in a"
1486,CHAPTER IV,"rouleau of gold, not as so much alloy in a weight of bullion. A friend"
1487,CHAPTER IV,"whose talents I hold in the highest respect, but whose judgment and"
1488,CHAPTER IV,"strong sound sense I have had almost continued occasion to revere,"
1489,CHAPTER IV,making the usual complaints to me concerning both the style and subjects
1490,CHAPTER IV,of Mr. Wordsworth’s minor poems; I admitted that there were some few of
1491,CHAPTER IV,"the tales and incidents, in which I could not myself find a sufficient"
1492,CHAPTER IV,cause for their having been recorded in metre. I mentioned Alice Fell as
1493,CHAPTER IV,"an instance; “Nay,” replied my friend with more than usual quickness of"
1494,CHAPTER IV,"manner, “I cannot agree with you there!--that, I own, does seem to me"
1495,CHAPTER IV,"a remarkably pleasing poem.” In the Lyrical Ballads, (for my experience"
1496,CHAPTER IV,does not enable me to extend the remark equally unqualified to the two
1497,CHAPTER IV,"subsequent volumes,) I have heard at different times, and from different"
1498,CHAPTER IV,"individuals, every single poem extolled and reprobated, with the"
1499,CHAPTER IV,"exception of those of loftier kind, which as was before observed, seem"
1500,CHAPTER IV,to have won universal praise. This fact of itself would have made me
1501,CHAPTER IV,"diffident in my censures, had not a still stronger ground been furnished"
1502,CHAPTER IV,by the strange contrast of the heat and long continuance of the
1503,CHAPTER IV,"opposition, with the nature of the faults stated as justifying it. The"
1504,CHAPTER IV,"seductive faults, the dulcia vitia of Cowley, Marini, or Darwin might"
1505,CHAPTER IV,reasonably be thought capable of corrupting the public judgment for half
1506,CHAPTER IV,"a century, and require a twenty years war, campaign after campaign, in"
1507,CHAPTER IV,order to dethrone the usurper and re-establish the legitimate taste.
1508,CHAPTER IV,"But that a downright simpleness, under the affectation of simplicity,"
1509,CHAPTER IV,"prosaic words in feeble metre, silly thoughts in childish phrases, and"
1510,CHAPTER IV,"a preference of mean, degrading, or at best trivial associations and"
1511,CHAPTER IV,"characters, should succeed in forming a school of imitators, a company"
1512,CHAPTER IV,"of almost religious admirers, and this too among young men of ardent"
1513,CHAPTER IV,"minds, liberal education, and not"
1514,CHAPTER IV,
1515,CHAPTER IV,------with academic laurels unbestowed;
1516,CHAPTER IV,
1517,CHAPTER IV,"and that this bare and bald counterfeit of poetry, which is"
1518,CHAPTER IV,"characterized as below criticism, should for nearly twenty years have"
1519,CHAPTER IV,"well-nigh engrossed criticism, as the main, if not the only, butt of"
1520,CHAPTER IV,"review, magazine, pamphlet, poem, and paragraph; this is indeed matter"
1521,CHAPTER IV,"of wonder. Of yet greater is it, that the contest should still continue"
1522,CHAPTER IV,as undecided as [19] that between Bacchus and the frogs in Aristophanes;
1523,CHAPTER IV,when the former descended to the realms of the departed to bring back
1524,CHAPTER IV,the spirit of old and genuine poesy;--
1525,CHAPTER IV,

1541,CHAPTER IV,
1542,CHAPTER IV,"During the last year of my residence at Cambridge, 1794, I became"
1543,CHAPTER IV,acquainted with Mr. Wordsworth’s first publication entitled Descriptive
1544,CHAPTER IV,"Sketches; and seldom, if ever, was the emergence of an original poetic"
1545,CHAPTER IV,genius above the literary horizon more evidently announced. In the
1546,CHAPTER IV,"form, style, and manner of the whole poem, and in the structure of"
1547,CHAPTER IV,"the particular lines and periods, there is a harshness and acerbity"
1548,CHAPTER IV,"connected and combined with words and images all a-glow, which might"
1549,CHAPTER IV,"recall those products of the vegetable world, where gorgeous blossoms"
1550,CHAPTER IV,"rise out of a hard and thorny rind and shell, within which the rich"
1551,CHAPTER IV,"fruit is elaborating. The language is not only peculiar and strong, but"
1552,CHAPTER IV,"at times knotty and contorted, as by its own impatient strength; while"
1553,CHAPTER IV,"the novelty and struggling crowd of images, acting in conjunction with"
1554,CHAPTER IV,"the difficulties of the style, demands always a greater closeness of"
1555,CHAPTER IV,"attention, than poetry,--at all events, than descriptive poetry--has"
1556,CHAPTER IV,a right to claim. It not seldom therefore justified the complaint of
1557,CHAPTER IV,"obscurity. In the following extract I have sometimes fancied, that I saw"
1558,CHAPTER IV,"an emblem of the poem itself, and of the author’s genius as it was then"
1559,CHAPTER IV,displayed.--
1560,CHAPTER IV,
1561,CHAPTER IV,"’Tis storm; and hid in mist from hour to hour,"
1562,CHAPTER IV,All day the floods a deepening murmur pour;
1563,CHAPTER IV,"The sky is veiled, and every cheerful sight"
1564,CHAPTER IV,Dark is the region as with coming night;
1565,CHAPTER IV,Yet what a sudden burst of overpowering light!
1566,CHAPTER IV,"Triumphant on the bosom of the storm,"
1567,CHAPTER IV,Glances the fire-clad eagle’s wheeling form;
1568,CHAPTER IV,"Eastward, in long perspective glittering, shine"
1569,CHAPTER IV,The wood-crowned cliffs that o’er the lake recline;
1570,CHAPTER IV,"Those Eastern cliffs a hundred streams unfold,"
1571,CHAPTER IV,At once to pillars turned that flame with gold;
1572,CHAPTER IV,Behind his sail the peasant strives to shun
1573,CHAPTER IV,"The west, that burns like one dilated sun,"
1574,CHAPTER IV,Where in a mighty crucible expire
1575,CHAPTER IV,"The mountains, glowing hot, like coals of fire."
1576,CHAPTER IV,
1577,CHAPTER IV,"The poetic Psyche, in its process to full development, undergoes as many"
1578,CHAPTER IV,"changes as its Greek namesake, the butterfly [20]. And it is remarkable"
1579,CHAPTER IV,how soon genius clears and purifies itself from the faults and errors of
1580,CHAPTER IV,"its earliest products; faults which, in its earliest compositions, are"
1581,CHAPTER IV,"the more obtrusive and confluent, because as heterogeneous elements,"
1582,CHAPTER IV,"which had only a temporary use, they constitute the very ferment,"
1583,CHAPTER IV,by which themselves are carried off. Or we may compare them to some
1584,CHAPTER IV,"diseases, which must work on the humours, and be thrown out on the"
1585,CHAPTER IV,"surface, in order to secure the patient from their future recurrence."
1586,CHAPTER IV,"I was in my twenty-fourth year, when I had the happiness of knowing Mr."
1587,CHAPTER IV,"Wordsworth personally, and while memory lasts, I shall hardly forget"
1588,CHAPTER IV,"the sudden effect produced on my mind, by his recitation of a manuscript"
1589,CHAPTER IV,"poem, which still remains unpublished, but of which the stanza and tone"
1590,CHAPTER IV,"of style were the same as those of The Female Vagrant, as originally"
1591,CHAPTER IV,printed in the first volume of the Lyrical Ballads. There was here no
1592,CHAPTER IV,"mark of strained thought, or forced diction, no crowd or turbulence of"
1593,CHAPTER IV,"imagery; and, as the poet hath himself well described in his Lines on"
1594,CHAPTER IV,"revisiting the Wye, manly reflection and human associations had given"
1595,CHAPTER IV,"both variety, and an additional interest to natural objects, which,"
1596,CHAPTER IV,"in the passion and appetite of the first love, they had seemed to him"
1597,CHAPTER IV,"neither to need nor permit. The occasional obscurities, which had risen"
1598,CHAPTER IV,"from an imperfect control over the resources of his native language, had"
1599,CHAPTER IV,"almost wholly disappeared, together with that worse defect of arbitrary"
1600,CHAPTER IV,"and illogical phrases, at once hackneyed and fantastic, which hold so"
1601,CHAPTER IV,"distinguished a place in the technique of ordinary poetry, and will,"
1602,CHAPTER IV,"more or less, alloy the earlier poems of the truest genius, unless"
1603,CHAPTER IV,the attention has been specially directed to their worthlessness and
1604,CHAPTER IV,incongruity [21]. I did not perceive anything particular in the mere
1605,CHAPTER IV,"style of the poem alluded to during its recitation, except indeed such"
1606,CHAPTER IV,difference as was not separable from the thought and manner; and the
1607,CHAPTER IV,"Spenserian stanza, which always, more or less, recalls to the reader’s"
1608,CHAPTER IV,"mind Spenser’s own style, would doubtless have authorized, in my then"
1609,CHAPTER IV,"opinion, a more frequent descent to the phrases of ordinary life, than"
1610,CHAPTER IV,could without an ill effect have been hazarded in the heroic couplet.
1611,CHAPTER IV,"It was not however the freedom from false taste, whether as to common"
1612,CHAPTER IV,"defects, or to those more properly his own, which made so unusual an"
1613,CHAPTER IV,"impression on my feelings immediately, and subsequently on my judgment."
1614,CHAPTER IV,It was the union of deep feeling with profound thought; the fine balance
1615,CHAPTER IV,"of truth in observing, with the imaginative faculty in modifying, the"
1616,CHAPTER IV,"objects observed; and above all the original gift of spreading the tone,"
1617,CHAPTER IV,"the atmosphere, and with it the depth and height of the ideal world"
1618,CHAPTER IV,"around forms, incidents, and situations, of which, for the common view,"
1619,CHAPTER IV,"custom had bedimmed all the lustre, had dried up the sparkle and the dew"
1620,CHAPTER IV,drops.
1621,CHAPTER IV,
1622,CHAPTER IV,"This excellence, which in all Mr. Wordsworth’s writings is more or"
1623,CHAPTER IV,"less predominant, and which constitutes the character of his mind, I no"
1624,CHAPTER IV,"sooner felt, than I sought to understand. Repeated meditations led me"
1625,CHAPTER IV,"first to suspect,--(and a more intimate analysis of the human faculties,"
1626,CHAPTER IV,"their appropriate marks, functions, and effects matured my conjecture"
1627,CHAPTER IV,"into full conviction,)--that Fancy and Imagination were two distinct and"
1628,CHAPTER IV,"widely different faculties, instead of being, according to the general"
1629,CHAPTER IV,"belief, either two names with one meaning, or, at furthest, the lower"
1630,CHAPTER IV,"and higher degree of one and the same power. It is not, I own, easy to"
1631,CHAPTER IV,conceive a more apposite translation of the Greek phantasia than the
1632,CHAPTER IV,Latin imaginatio; but it is equally true that in all societies there
1633,CHAPTER IV,"exists an instinct of growth, a certain collective, unconscious good"
1634,CHAPTER IV,sense working progressively to desynonymize [22] those words originally
1635,CHAPTER IV,"of the same meaning, which the conflux of dialects supplied to the"
1636,CHAPTER IV,"more homogeneous languages, as the Greek and German: and which the"
1637,CHAPTER IV,"same cause, joined with accidents of translation from original works of"
1638,CHAPTER IV,"different countries, occasion in mixed languages like our own. The first"
1639,CHAPTER IV,"and most important point to be proved is, that two conceptions perfectly"
1640,CHAPTER IV,"distinct are confused under one and the same word, and--this done--to"
1641,CHAPTER IV,"appropriate that word exclusively to the one meaning, and the synonyme,"
1642,CHAPTER IV,"should there be one, to the other. But if,--(as will be often the case"
1643,CHAPTER IV,"in the arts and sciences,)--no synonyme exists, we must either invent"
1644,CHAPTER IV,or borrow a word. In the present instance the appropriation has already
1645,CHAPTER IV,"begun, and been legitimated in the derivative adjective: Milton had a"
1646,CHAPTER IV,"highly imaginative, Cowley a very fanciful mind. If therefore I should"
1647,CHAPTER IV,succeed in establishing the actual existence of two faculties generally
1648,CHAPTER IV,"different, the nomenclature would be at once determined. To the"
1649,CHAPTER IV,"faculty by which I had characterized Milton, we should confine the term"
1650,CHAPTER IV,‘imagination;’ while the other would be contra-distinguished as ‘fancy.’
1651,CHAPTER IV,"Now were it once fully ascertained, that this division is no less"
1652,CHAPTER IV,"grounded in nature than that of delirium from mania, or Otway’s"
1653,CHAPTER IV,
1654,CHAPTER IV,"Lutes, laurels, seas of milk, and ships of amber,"
1655,CHAPTER IV,
1656,CHAPTER IV,from Shakespeare’s
1657,CHAPTER IV,
1658,CHAPTER IV,What! have his daughters brought him to this pass?
1659,CHAPTER IV,
1660,CHAPTER IV,or from the preceding apostrophe to the elements; the theory of the fine
1661,CHAPTER IV,"arts, and of poetry in particular, could not but derive some additional"
1662,CHAPTER IV,and important light. It would in its immediate effects furnish a torch
1663,CHAPTER IV,of guidance to the philosophical critic; and ultimately to the poet
1664,CHAPTER IV,"himself. In energetic minds, truth soon changes by domestication into"
1665,CHAPTER IV,power; and from directing in the discrimination and appraisal of the
1666,CHAPTER IV,"product, becomes influencive in the production. To admire on principle,"
1667,CHAPTER IV,is the only way to imitate without loss of originality.
1668,CHAPTER IV,
1669,CHAPTER IV,"It has been already hinted, that metaphysics and psychology have long"
1670,CHAPTER IV,"been my hobby-horse. But to have a hobby-horse, and to be vain of it,"
1671,CHAPTER IV,"are so commonly found together, that they pass almost for the same. I"
1672,CHAPTER IV,"trust therefore, that there will be more good humour than contempt,"
1673,CHAPTER IV,"in the smile with which the reader chastises my self-complacency, if I"
1674,CHAPTER IV,"confess myself uncertain, whether the satisfaction from the perception"
1675,CHAPTER IV,of a truth new to myself may not have been rendered more poignant by the
1676,CHAPTER IV,"conceit, that it would be equally so to the public. There was a time,"
1677,CHAPTER IV,"certainly, in which I took some little credit to myself, in the belief"
1678,CHAPTER IV,"that I had been the first of my countrymen, who had pointed out the"
1679,CHAPTER IV,"diverse meaning of which the two terms were capable, and analyzed the"
1680,CHAPTER IV,faculties to which they should be appropriated. Mr. W. Taylor’s recent
1681,CHAPTER IV,volume of synonymes I have not yet seen [23]; but his specification of
1682,CHAPTER IV,the terms in question has been clearly shown to be both insufficient and
1683,CHAPTER IV,erroneous by Mr. Wordsworth in the Preface added to the late collection
1684,CHAPTER IV,"of his Poems. The explanation which Mr. Wordsworth has himself given,"
1685,CHAPTER IV,"will be found to differ from mine, chiefly, perhaps as our objects are"
1686,CHAPTER IV,"different. It could scarcely indeed happen otherwise, from the advantage"
1687,CHAPTER IV,I have enjoyed of frequent conversation with him on a subject to which
1688,CHAPTER IV,"a poem of his own first directed my attention, and my conclusions"
1689,CHAPTER IV,concerning which he had made more lucid to myself by many happy
1690,CHAPTER IV,instances drawn from the operation of natural objects on the mind. But
1691,CHAPTER IV,it was Mr. Wordsworth’s purpose to consider the influences of fancy and
1692,CHAPTER IV,"imagination as they are manifested in poetry, and from the different"
1693,CHAPTER IV,effects to conclude their diversity in kind; while it is my object to
1694,CHAPTER IV,"investigate the seminal principle, and then from the kind to deduce the"
1695,CHAPTER IV,degree. My friend has drawn a masterly sketch of the branches with their
1696,CHAPTER IV,"poetic fruitage. I wish to add the trunk, and even the roots as far as"
1697,CHAPTER IV,"they lift themselves above ground, and are visible to the naked eye of"
1698,CHAPTER IV,our common consciousness.
1699,CHAPTER IV,
1700,CHAPTER IV,Yet even in this attempt I am aware that I shall be obliged to draw more
1701,CHAPTER IV,"largely on the reader’s attention, than so immethodical a miscellany as"
1702,CHAPTER IV,this can authorize; when in such a work (the Ecclesiasical Polity) of
1703,CHAPTER IV,"such a mind as Hooker’s, the judicious author, though no less admirable"
1704,CHAPTER IV,"for the perspicuity than for the port and dignity of his language,--and"
1705,CHAPTER IV,"though he wrote for men of learning in a learned age,--saw nevertheless"
1706,CHAPTER IV,"occasion to anticipate and guard against “complaints of obscurity,” as"
1707,CHAPTER IV,often as he was to trace his subject “to the highest well-spring and
1708,CHAPTER IV,"fountain.” Which, (continues he) “because men are not accustomed to, the"
1709,CHAPTER IV,"pains we take are more needful a great deal, than acceptable; and the"
1710,CHAPTER IV,"matters we handle, seem by reason of newness (till the mind grow better"
1711,CHAPTER IV,acquainted with them) dark and intricate.” I would gladly therefore
1712,CHAPTER IV,"spare both myself and others this labour, if I knew how without it"
1713,CHAPTER IV,"to present an intelligible statement of my poetic creed,--not as my"
1714,CHAPTER IV,"opinions, which weigh for nothing, but as deductions from established"
1715,CHAPTER IV,"premises conveyed in such a form, as is calculated either to effect a"
1716,CHAPTER IV,"fundamental conviction, or to receive a fundamental confutation. If I"
1717,CHAPTER IV,"may dare once more adopt the words of Hooker, “they, unto whom we shall"
1718,CHAPTER IV,"seem tedious, are in no wise injured by us, because it is in their own"
1719,CHAPTER IV,"hands to spare that labour, which they are not willing to endure.” Those"
1720,CHAPTER IV,"at least, let me be permitted to add, who have taken so much pains to"
1721,CHAPTER IV,"render me ridiculous for a perversion of taste, and have supported the"
1722,CHAPTER IV,charge by attributing strange notions to me on no other authority than
1723,CHAPTER IV,"their own conjectures, owe it to themselves as well as to me not to"
1724,CHAPTER IV,refuse their attention to my own statement of the theory which I do
1725,CHAPTER IV,acknowledge; or shrink from the trouble of examining the grounds on

1733,CHAPTER V,On the law of Association--Its history traced from Aristotle to Hartley.
1734,CHAPTER V,
1735,CHAPTER V,
1736,CHAPTER V,"There have been men in all ages, who have been impelled as by an"
1737,CHAPTER V,"instinct to propose their own nature as a problem, and who devote their"
1738,CHAPTER V,attempts to its solution. The first step was to construct a table of
1739,CHAPTER V,"distinctions, which they seem to have formed on the principle of the"
1740,CHAPTER V,"absence or presence of the Will. Our various sensations, perceptions,"
1741,CHAPTER V,"and movements were classed as active or passive, or as media partaking"
1742,CHAPTER V,of both. A still finer distinction was soon established between the
1743,CHAPTER V,voluntary and the spontaneous. In our perceptions we seem to ourselves
1744,CHAPTER V,"merely passive to an external power, whether as a mirror reflecting the"
1745,CHAPTER V,"landscape, or as a blank canvass on which some unknown hand paints it."
1746,CHAPTER V,"For it is worthy of notice, that the latter, or the system of Idealism"
1747,CHAPTER V,"may be traced to sources equally remote with the former, or Materialism;"
1748,CHAPTER V,and Berkeley can boast an ancestry at least as venerable as Gassendi
1749,CHAPTER V,"or Hobbes. These conjectures, however, concerning the mode in which our"
1750,CHAPTER V,"perceptions originated, could not alter the natural difference of Things"
1751,CHAPTER V,"and Thoughts. In the former, the cause appeared wholly external,"
1752,CHAPTER V,"while in the latter, sometimes our will interfered as the producing or"
1753,CHAPTER V,"determining cause, and sometimes our nature seemed to act by a mechanism"
1754,CHAPTER V,"of its own, without any conscious effort of the will, or even against"
1755,CHAPTER V,"it. Our inward experiences were thus arranged in three separate classes,"
1756,CHAPTER V,"the passive sense, or what the School-men call the merely receptive"
1757,CHAPTER V,"quality of the mind; the voluntary; and the spontaneous, which holds the"
1758,CHAPTER V,middle place between both. But it is not in human nature to meditate on
1759,CHAPTER V,"any mode of action, without inquiring after the law that governs it;"
1760,CHAPTER V,"and in the explanation of the spontaneous movements of our being, the"
1761,CHAPTER V,metaphysician took the lead of the anatomist and natural philosopher. In
1762,CHAPTER V,"Egypt, Palestine, Greece, and India the analysis of the mind had reached"
1763,CHAPTER V,"its noon and manhood, while experimental research was still in its dawn"
1764,CHAPTER V,"and infancy. For many, very many centuries, it has been difficult to"
1765,CHAPTER V,"advance a new truth, or even a new error, in the philosophy of the"
1766,CHAPTER V,"intellect or morals. With regard, however, to the laws that direct the"
1767,CHAPTER V,spontaneous movements of thought and the principle of their intellectual
1768,CHAPTER V,"mechanism there exists, it has been asserted, an important exception"
1769,CHAPTER V,"most honourable to the moderns, and in the merit of which our own"
1770,CHAPTER V,"country claims the largest share. Sir James Mackintosh,--(who, amid the"
1771,CHAPTER V,"variety of his talents and attainments, is not of less repute for the"
1772,CHAPTER V,depth and accuracy of his philosophical inquiries than for the
1773,CHAPTER V,eloquence with which he is said to render their most difficult results
1774,CHAPTER V,"perspicuous, and the driest attractive,)--affirmed in the Lectures,"
1775,CHAPTER V,"delivered by him in Lincoln’s Inn Hall, that the law of association as"
1776,CHAPTER V,"established in the contemporaneity of the original impressions,"
1777,CHAPTER V,formed the basis of all true psychology; and that any ontological or
1778,CHAPTER V,"metaphysical science, not contained in such (that is, an empirical)"
1779,CHAPTER V,"psychology, was but a web of abstractions and generalizations. Of this"
1780,CHAPTER V,"prolific truth, of this great fundamental law, he declared Hobbes to"
1781,CHAPTER V,"have been the original discoverer, while its full application to the"
1782,CHAPTER V,whole intellectual system we owed to Hartley; who stood in the same
1783,CHAPTER V,relation to Hobbes as Newton to Kepler; the law of association being
1784,CHAPTER V,"that to the mind, which gravitation is to matter."
1785,CHAPTER V,
1786,CHAPTER V,"Of the former clause in this assertion, as it respects the comparative"
1787,CHAPTER V,"merits of the ancient metaphysicians, including their commentators, the"
1788,CHAPTER V,"School-men, and of the modern and British and French philosophers from"
1789,CHAPTER V,"Hobbes to Hume, Hartley, and Condillac, this is not the place to speak."
1790,CHAPTER V,So wide indeed is the chasm between Sir James Mackintosh’s philosophical
1791,CHAPTER V,"creed and mine, that so far from being able to join hands, we could"
1792,CHAPTER V,scarcely make our voices intelligible to each other: and to bridge it
1793,CHAPTER V,"over would require more time, skill, and power than I believe myself"
1794,CHAPTER V,to possess. But the latter clause involves for the greater part a mere
1795,CHAPTER V,"question of fact and history, and the accuracy of the statement is to be"
1796,CHAPTER V,tried by documents rather than reasoning.
1797,CHAPTER V,
1798,CHAPTER V,"First, then, I deny Hobbes’s claim in toto: for he had been anticipated"
1799,CHAPTER V,"by Des Cartes, whose work De Methodo, preceded Hobbes’s De Natura"
1800,CHAPTER V,"Humana, by more than a year. But what is of much more importance,"
1801,CHAPTER V,Hobbes builds nothing on the principle which he had announced. He does
1802,CHAPTER V,"not even announce it, as differing in any respect from the general laws"
1803,CHAPTER V,"of material motion and impact: nor was it, indeed, possible for him so"
1804,CHAPTER V,"to do, compatibly with his system, which was exclusively material and"
1805,CHAPTER V,mechanical. Far otherwise is it with Des Cartes; greatly as he too in
1806,CHAPTER V,his after writings (and still more egregiously his followers De la
1807,CHAPTER V,"Forge, and others) obscured the truth by their attempts to explain it"
1808,CHAPTER V,"on the theory of nervous fluids, and material configurations. But, in"
1809,CHAPTER V,"his interesting work, De Methodo, Des Cartes relates the circumstance"
1810,CHAPTER V,"which first led him to meditate on this subject, and which since then"
1811,CHAPTER V,has been often noticed and employed as an instance and illustration of
1812,CHAPTER V,the law. A child who with its eyes bandaged had lost several of his
1813,CHAPTER V,"fingers by amputation, continued to complain for many days successively"
1814,CHAPTER V,"of pains, now in this joint and now in that, of the very fingers which"
1815,CHAPTER V,had been cut off. Des Cartes was led by this incident to reflect on the
1816,CHAPTER V,uncertainty with which we attribute any particular place to any inward
1817,CHAPTER V,"pain or uneasiness, and proceeded after long consideration to establish"
1818,CHAPTER V,"it as a general law: that contemporaneous impressions, whether images"
1819,CHAPTER V,"or sensations, recall each other mechanically. On this principle, as a"
1820,CHAPTER V,"ground work, he built up the whole system of human language, as one"
1821,CHAPTER V,continued process of association. He showed in what sense not only
1822,CHAPTER V,"general terms, but generic images,--under the name of abstract"
1823,CHAPTER V,"ideas,--actually existed, and in what consist their nature and power."
1824,CHAPTER V,"As one word may become the general exponent of many, so by association"
1825,CHAPTER V,a simple image may represent a whole class. But in truth Hobbes himself
1826,CHAPTER V,"makes no claims to any discovery, and introduces this law of"
1827,CHAPTER V,"association, or (in his own language) discursion of mind, as an"
1828,CHAPTER V,"admitted fact, in the solution alone of which, and this by causes"
1829,CHAPTER V,"purely physiological, he arrogates any originality. His system is"
1830,CHAPTER V,"briefly this; whenever the senses are impinged on by external objects,"
1831,CHAPTER V,"whether by the rays of light reflected from them, or by effluxes of"
1832,CHAPTER V,"their finer particles, there results a correspondent motion of the"
1833,CHAPTER V,innermost and subtlest organs. This motion constitutes a
1834,CHAPTER V,"representation, and there remains an impression of the same, or a"
1835,CHAPTER V,certain disposition to repeat the same motion. Whenever we feel several
1836,CHAPTER V,"objects at the same time, the impressions that are left, (or in the"
1837,CHAPTER V,"language of Mr. Hume, the ideas,)[24] are linked together. Whenever"
1838,CHAPTER V,"therefore any one of the movements, which constitute a complex"
1839,CHAPTER V,"impression, is renewed through the senses, the others succeed"
1840,CHAPTER V,"mechanically. It follows of necessity, therefore, that Hobbes, as well"
1841,CHAPTER V,as Hartley and all others who derive association from the connection
1842,CHAPTER V,"and interdependence of the supposed matter, the movements of which"
1843,CHAPTER V,"constitute our thoughts, must have reduced all its forms to the one law"
1844,CHAPTER V,of Time. But even the merit of announcing this law with philosophic
1845,CHAPTER V,precision cannot be fairly conceded to him. For the objects of any two
1846,CHAPTER V,ideas need not have co-existed in the same sensation in order to become
1847,CHAPTER V,mutually associable. The same result will follow when one only of the
1848,CHAPTER V,"two ideas has been represented by the senses, and the other by the"
1849,CHAPTER V,memory.
1850,CHAPTER V,
1851,CHAPTER V,Long however before either Hobbes or Des Cartes the law of association
1852,CHAPTER V,"had been defined, and its important functions set forth by Ludovicus"
1853,CHAPTER V,"Vives. Phantasia, it is to be noticed, is employed by Vives to express"
1854,CHAPTER V,"the mental power of comprehension, or the active function of the mind;"
1855,CHAPTER V,"and imaginatio for the receptivity (via receptiva) of impressions, or"
1856,CHAPTER V,for the passive perception. The power of combination he appropriates
1857,CHAPTER V,"to the former: “quae singula et simpliciter acceperat imaginatio, ea"
1858,CHAPTER V,conjungit et disjungait phantasia.” And the law by which the thoughts
1859,CHAPTER V,are spontaneously presented follows thus: “quae simul sunt a phantasia
1860,CHAPTER V,"comprehensa, si alterutrum occurrat, solet secum alterum representare.”"
1861,CHAPTER V,To time therefore he subordinates all the other exciting causes
1862,CHAPTER V,"of association. The soul proceeds “a causa ad effectum, ab hoc ad"
1863,CHAPTER V,"instrumentum, a parte ad totum;” thence to the place, from place to"
1864,CHAPTER V,"person, and from this to whatever preceded or followed, all as being"
1865,CHAPTER V,"parts of a total impression, each of which may recall the other. The"
1866,CHAPTER V,"apparent springs “saltus vel transitus etiam longissimos,” he explains"
1867,CHAPTER V,by the same thought having been a component part of two or more total
1868,CHAPTER V,"impressions. Thus “ex Scipione venio in cogitationem potentiae Turcicae,"
1869,CHAPTER V,"propter victorias ejus de Asia, in qua regnabat Antiochus.”"
1870,CHAPTER V,
1871,CHAPTER V,"But from Vives I pass at once to the source of his doctrines, and (as"
1872,CHAPTER V,far as we can judge from the remains yet extant of Greek philosophy)
1873,CHAPTER V,"as to the first, so to the fullest and most perfect enunciation of the"
1874,CHAPTER V,"associative principle, namely, to the writings of Aristotle; and of"
1875,CHAPTER V,"these in particular to the treatises De Anima, and “De Memoria,” which"
1876,CHAPTER V,last belongs to the series of essays entitled in the old translations
1877,CHAPTER V,"Parva Naturalia. In as much as later writers have either deviated from,"
1878,CHAPTER V,"or added to his doctrines, they appear to me to have introduced either"
1879,CHAPTER V,error or groundless supposition.
1880,CHAPTER V,
1881,CHAPTER V,"In the first place it is to be observed, that Aristotle’s positions on"
1882,CHAPTER V,this subject are unmixed with fiction. The wise Stagyrite speaks of no
1883,CHAPTER V,"successive particles propagating motion like billiard balls, as Hobbes;"
1884,CHAPTER V,"nor of nervous or animal spirits, where inanimate and irrational solids"
1885,CHAPTER V,"are thawed down, and distilled, or filtrated by ascension, into living"
1886,CHAPTER V,"and intelligent fluids, that etch and re-etch engravings on the brain,"
1887,CHAPTER V,"as the followers of Des Cartes, and the humoral pathologists in general;"
1888,CHAPTER V,nor of an oscillating ether which was to effect the same service for the
1889,CHAPTER V,"nerves of the brain considered as solid fibres, as the animal"
1890,CHAPTER V,"spirits perform for them under the notion of hollow tubes, as Hartley"
1891,CHAPTER V,"teaches--nor finally, (with yet more recent dreamers) of chemical"
1892,CHAPTER V,"compositions by elective affinity, or of an electric light at once the"
1893,CHAPTER V,"immediate object and the ultimate organ of inward vision, which rises"
1894,CHAPTER V,"to the brain like an Aurora Borealis, and there, disporting in various"
1895,CHAPTER V,"shapes,--as the balance of plus and minus, or negative and positive,"
1896,CHAPTER V,"is destroyed or re-established,--images out both past and present."
1897,CHAPTER V,Aristotle delivers a just theory without pretending to an hypothesis;
1898,CHAPTER V,"or in other words a comprehensive survey of the different facts, and"
1899,CHAPTER V,"of their relations to each other without supposition, that is, a fact"
1900,CHAPTER V,"placed under a number of facts, as their common support and explanation;"
1901,CHAPTER V,though in the majority of instances these hypotheses or suppositions
1902,CHAPTER V,"better deserve the name of upopoiaeseis, or suffictions. He uses indeed"
1903,CHAPTER V,"the word kinaeseis, to express what we call representations or ideas,"
1904,CHAPTER V,"but he carefully distinguishes them from material motion, designating"
1905,CHAPTER V,"the latter always by annexing the words en topo, or kata topon. On the"
1906,CHAPTER V,"contrary, in his treatise De Anima, he excludes place and motion from"
1907,CHAPTER V,"all the operations of thought, whether representations or volitions, as"
1908,CHAPTER V,attributes utterly and absurdly heterogeneous.
1909,CHAPTER V,
1910,CHAPTER V,"The general law of association, or, more accurately, the common"
1911,CHAPTER V,"condition under which all exciting causes act, and in which they may"
1912,CHAPTER V,"be generalized, according to Aristotle is this. Ideas by having been"
1913,CHAPTER V,together acquire a power of recalling each other; or every partial
1914,CHAPTER V,representation awakes the total representation of which it had been
1915,CHAPTER V,a part. In the practical determination of this common principle to
1916,CHAPTER V,"particular recollections, he admits five agents or occasioning"
1917,CHAPTER V,"causes: first, connection in time, whether simultaneous, preceding,"
1918,CHAPTER V,"or successive; second, vicinity or connection in space; third,"
1919,CHAPTER V,"interdependence or necessary connection, as cause and effect; fourth,"
1920,CHAPTER V,"likeness; and fifth, contrast. As an additional solution of the"
1921,CHAPTER V,"occasional seeming chasms in the continuity of reproduction he proves,"
1922,CHAPTER V,that movements or ideas possessing one or the other of these five
1923,CHAPTER V,"characters had passed through the mind as intermediate links,"
1924,CHAPTER V,sufficiently clear to recall other parts of the same total impressions
1925,CHAPTER V,"with which they had co-existed, though not vivid enough to excite that"
1926,CHAPTER V,"degree of attention which is requisite for distinct recollection, or"
1927,CHAPTER V,"as we may aptly express it, after consciousness. In association then"
1928,CHAPTER V,"consists the whole mechanism of the reproduction of impressions, in the"
1929,CHAPTER V,Aristotelian Psychology. It is the universal law of the passive fancy
1930,CHAPTER V,and mechanical memory; that which supplies to all other faculties their
1931,CHAPTER V,"objects, to all thought the elements of its materials."
1932,CHAPTER V,
1933,CHAPTER V,In consulting the excellent commentary of St. Thomas Aquinas on the
1934,CHAPTER V,"Parva Naturalia of Aristotle, I was struck at once with its close"
1935,CHAPTER V,resemblance to Hume’s Essay on Association. The main thoughts were
1936,CHAPTER V,"the same in both, the order of the thoughts was the same, and even the"
1937,CHAPTER V,illustrations differed only by Hume’s occasional substitution of more
1938,CHAPTER V,modern examples. I mentioned the circumstance to several of my literary
1939,CHAPTER V,"acquaintances, who admitted the closeness of the resemblance, and"
1940,CHAPTER V,that it seemed too great to be explained by mere coincidence; but
1941,CHAPTER V,they thought it improbable that Hume should have held the pages of the
1942,CHAPTER V,Angelic Doctor worth turning over. But some time after Mr. Payne showed
1943,CHAPTER V,"Sir James Mackintosh some odd volumes of St. Thomas Aquinas, partly"
1944,CHAPTER V,perhaps from having heard that he had in his Lectures passed a high
1945,CHAPTER V,"encomium on this canonized philosopher; but chiefly from the fact, that"
1946,CHAPTER V,"the volumes had belonged to Mr. Hume, and had here and there marginal"
1947,CHAPTER V,marks and notes of reference in his own hand writing. Among these
1948,CHAPTER V,"volumes was that which contains the Parva Naturalia, in the old Latin"
1949,CHAPTER V,"version, swathed and swaddled in the commentary afore mentioned"
1950,CHAPTER V,
1951,CHAPTER V,"It remains then for me, first to state wherein Hartley differs from"
1952,CHAPTER V,"Aristotle; then, to exhibit the grounds of my conviction, that"
1953,CHAPTER V,"he differed only to err: and next as the result, to show, by what"
1954,CHAPTER V,influences of the choice and judgment the associative power becomes
1955,CHAPTER V,"either memory or fancy; and, in conclusion, to appropriate the remaining"
1956,CHAPTER V,"offices of the mind to the reason, and the imagination. With my best"
1957,CHAPTER V,efforts to be as perspicuous as the nature of language will permit
1958,CHAPTER V,"on such a subject, I earnestly solicit the good wishes and friendly"
1959,CHAPTER V,"patience of my readers, while I thus go “sounding on my dim and perilous"
1960,CHAPTER V,way.”
1961,CHAPTER V,
1962,CHAPTER V,
1963,CHAPTER V,
1964,CHAPTER V,
1965,CHAPTER VI,CHAPTER VI
1966,CHAPTER VI,
1967,CHAPTER VI,"That Hartley’s system, as far as it differs from that of Aristotle, is"
1968,CHAPTER VI,"neither tenable in theory, nor founded in facts."
1969,CHAPTER VI,
1970,CHAPTER VI,
1971,CHAPTER VI,Of Hartley’s hypothetical vibrations in his hypothetical oscillating
1972,CHAPTER VI,"ether of the nerves, which is the first and most obvious distinction"
1973,CHAPTER VI,"between his system and that of Aristotle, I shall say little. This, with"
1974,CHAPTER VI,all other similar attempts to render that an object of the sight which
1975,CHAPTER VI,"has no relation to sight, has been already sufficiently exposed by the"
1976,CHAPTER VI,"younger Reimarus, Maasz, and others, as outraging the very axioms"
1977,CHAPTER VI,"of mechanics in a scheme, the merit of which consists in its being"
1978,CHAPTER VI,"mechanical. Whether any other philosophy be possible, but the"
1979,CHAPTER VI,"mechanical; and again, whether the mechanical system can have any"
1980,CHAPTER VI,"claim to be called philosophy; are questions for another place. It is,"
1981,CHAPTER VI,"however, certain, that as long as we deny the former, and affirm the"
1982,CHAPTER VI,"latter, we must bewilder ourselves, whenever we would pierce into the"
1983,CHAPTER VI,"adyta of causation; and all that laborious conjecture can do, is to fill"
1984,CHAPTER VI,up the gaps of fancy. Under that despotism of the eye (the emancipation
1985,CHAPTER VI,"from which Pythagoras by his numeral, and Plato by his musical, symbols,"
1986,CHAPTER VI,"and both by geometric discipline, aimed at, as the first propaideuma of"
1987,CHAPTER VI,"the mind)--under this strong sensuous influence, we are restless"
1988,CHAPTER VI,because invisible things are not the objects of vision; and metaphysical
1989,CHAPTER VI,"systems, for the most part, become popular, not for their truth, but in"
1990,CHAPTER VI,"proportion as they attribute to causes a susceptibility of being seen,"
1991,CHAPTER VI,if only our visual organs were sufficiently powerful.
1992,CHAPTER VI,
1993,CHAPTER VI,From a hundred possible confutations let one suffice. According to
1994,CHAPTER VI,this system the idea or vibration a from the external object A becomes
1995,CHAPTER VI,"associable with the idea or vibration m from the external object M,"
1996,CHAPTER VI,because the oscillation a propagated itself so as to re-produce the
1997,CHAPTER VI,oscillation m. But the original impression from M was essentially
1998,CHAPTER VI,different from the impression A: unless therefore different causes
1999,CHAPTER VI,"may produce the same effect, the vibration a could never produce the"
2000,CHAPTER VI,"vibration m: and this therefore could never be the means, by which a and"
2001,CHAPTER VI,"m are associated. To understand this, the attentive reader need only be"
2002,CHAPTER VI,"reminded, that the ideas are themselves, in Hartley’s system, nothing"
2003,CHAPTER VI,more than their appropriate configurative vibrations. It is a mere
2004,CHAPTER VI,"delusion of the fancy to conceive the pre-existence of the ideas, in any"
2005,CHAPTER VI,"chain of association, as so many differently coloured billiard-balls in"
2006,CHAPTER VI,"contact, so that when an object, the billiard-stick, strikes the first"
2007,CHAPTER VI,"or white ball, the same motion propagates itself through the red, green,"
2008,CHAPTER VI,"blue and black, and sets the whole in motion. No! we must suppose the"
2009,CHAPTER VI,"very same force, which constitutes the white ball, to constitute the red"
2010,CHAPTER VI,or black; or the idea of a circle to constitute the idea of a triangle;
2011,CHAPTER VI,which is impossible.
2012,CHAPTER VI,
2013,CHAPTER VI,"But it may be said, that by the sensations from the objects A and M,"
2014,CHAPTER VI,"the nerves have acquired a disposition to the vibrations a and m, and"
2015,CHAPTER VI,therefore a need only be repeated in order to re-produce m. Now we will
2016,CHAPTER VI,"grant, for a moment, the possibility of such a disposition in a"
2017,CHAPTER VI,"material nerve, which yet seems scarcely less absurd than to say, that a"
2018,CHAPTER VI,"weather-cock had acquired a habit of turning to the east, from the wind"
2019,CHAPTER VI,"having been so long in that quarter: for if it be replied, that we must"
2020,CHAPTER VI,"take in the circumstance of life, what then becomes of the mechanical"
2021,CHAPTER VI,"philosophy? And what is the nerve, but the flint which the wag placed in"
2022,CHAPTER VI,"the pot as the first ingredient of his stone broth, requiring only"
2023,CHAPTER VI,"salt, turnips, and mutton, for the remainder! But if we waive this, and"
2024,CHAPTER VI,pre-suppose the actual existence of such a disposition; two cases
2025,CHAPTER VI,"are possible. Either, every idea has its own nerve and correspondent"
2026,CHAPTER VI,"oscillation, or this is not the case. If the latter be the truth, we"
2027,CHAPTER VI,"should gain nothing by these dispositions; for then, every nerve having"
2028,CHAPTER VI,"several dispositions, when the motion of any other nerve is propagated"
2029,CHAPTER VI,"into it, there will be no ground or cause present, why exactly the"
2030,CHAPTER VI,"oscillation m should arise, rather than any other to which it was"
2031,CHAPTER VI,"equally pre-disposed. But if we take the former, and let every idea have"
2032,CHAPTER VI,"a nerve of its own, then every nerve must be capable of propagating its"
2033,CHAPTER VI,"motion into many other nerves; and again, there is no reason assignable,"
2034,CHAPTER VI,"why the vibration m should arise, rather than any other ad libitum."
2035,CHAPTER VI,
2036,CHAPTER VI,It is fashionable to smile at Hartley’s vibrations and vibratiuncles;
2037,CHAPTER VI,"and his work has been re-edited by Priestley, with the omission of the"
2038,CHAPTER VI,"material hypothesis. But Hartley was too great a man, too coherent a"
2039,CHAPTER VI,"thinker, for this to have been done, either consistently or to any wise"
2040,CHAPTER VI,"purpose. For all other parts of his system, as far as they are peculiar"
2041,CHAPTER VI,"to that system, once removed from their mechanical basis, not only lose"
2042,CHAPTER VI,"their main support, but the very motive which led to their adoption."
2043,CHAPTER VI,"Thus the principle of contemporaneity, which Aristotle had made the"
2044,CHAPTER VI,"common condition of all the laws of association, Hartley was constrained"
2045,CHAPTER VI,to represent as being itself the sole law. For to what law can the
2046,CHAPTER VI,"action of material atoms be subject, but that of proximity in place? And"
2047,CHAPTER VI,"to what law can their motions be subjected but that of time? Again, from"
2048,CHAPTER VI,"this results inevitably, that the will, the reason, the judgment,"
2049,CHAPTER VI,"and the understanding, instead of being the determining causes of"
2050,CHAPTER VI,"association, must needs be represented as its creatures, and among its"
2051,CHAPTER VI,"mechanical effects. Conceive, for instance, a broad stream, winding"
2052,CHAPTER VI,"through a mountainous country with an indefinite number of currents,"
2053,CHAPTER VI,varying and running into each other according as the gusts chance to
2054,CHAPTER VI,blow from the opening of the mountains. The temporary union of several
2055,CHAPTER VI,"currents in one, so as to form the main current of the moment, would"
2056,CHAPTER VI,present an accurate image of Hartley’s theory of the will.
2057,CHAPTER VI,
2058,CHAPTER VI,"Had this been really the case, the consequence would have been, that"
2059,CHAPTER VI,our whole life would be divided between the despotism of outward
2060,CHAPTER VI,"impressions, and that of senseless and passive memory. Take his law in"
2061,CHAPTER VI,"its highest abstraction and most philosophical form, namely, that every"
2062,CHAPTER VI,partial representation recalls the total representation of which it was
2063,CHAPTER VI,"a part; and the law becomes nugatory, were it only for its universality."
2064,CHAPTER VI,"In practice it would indeed be mere lawlessness. Consider, how immense"
2065,CHAPTER VI,must be the sphere of a total impression from the top of St. Paul’s
2066,CHAPTER VI,church; and how rapid and continuous the series of such total
2067,CHAPTER VI,"impressions. If, therefore, we suppose the absence of all interference"
2068,CHAPTER VI,"of the will, reason, and judgment, one or other of two consequences must"
2069,CHAPTER VI,"result. Either the ideas, or reliques of such impression, will exactly"
2070,CHAPTER VI,"imitate the order of the impression itself, which would be absolute"
2071,CHAPTER VI,delirium: or any one part of that impression might recall any other
2072,CHAPTER VI,"part, and--(as from the law of continuity, there must exist in every"
2073,CHAPTER VI,"total impression, some one or more parts, which are components of some"
2074,CHAPTER VI,"other following total impression, and so on ad infinitum)--any part"
2075,CHAPTER VI,"of any impression might recall any part of any other, without a cause"
2076,CHAPTER VI,"present to determine what it should be. For to bring in the will, or"
2077,CHAPTER VI,"reason, as causes of their own cause, that is, as at once causes and"
2078,CHAPTER VI,"effects, can satisfy those only who, in their pretended evidences of a"
2079,CHAPTER VI,"God, having first demanded organization, as the sole cause and ground"
2080,CHAPTER VI,"of intellect, will then coolly demand the pre-existence of intellect,"
2081,CHAPTER VI,as the cause and ground-work of organization. There is in truth but
2082,CHAPTER VI,"one state to which this theory applies at all, namely, that of complete"
2083,CHAPTER VI,"light-headedness; and even to this it applies but partially, because the"
2084,CHAPTER VI,will and reason are perhaps never wholly suspended.
2085,CHAPTER VI,
2086,CHAPTER VI,A case of this kind occurred in a Roman Catholic town in Germany a year
2087,CHAPTER VI,"or two before my arrival at Goettingen, and had not then ceased to be"
2088,CHAPTER VI,a frequent subject of conversation. A young woman of four or five and
2089,CHAPTER VI,"twenty, who could neither read, nor write, was seized with a nervous"
2090,CHAPTER VI,"fever; during which, according to the asseverations of all the priests"
2091,CHAPTER VI,"and monks of the neighbourhood, she became possessed, and, as it"
2092,CHAPTER VI,"appeared, by a very learned devil. She continued incessantly talking"
2093,CHAPTER VI,"Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, in very pompous tones and with most distinct"
2094,CHAPTER VI,enunciation. This possession was rendered more probable by the known
2095,CHAPTER VI,fact that she was or had been a heretic. Voltaire humorously advises the
2096,CHAPTER VI,devil to decline all acquaintance with medical men; and it would have
2097,CHAPTER VI,"been more to his reputation, if he had taken this advice in the present"
2098,CHAPTER VI,instance. The case had attracted the particular attention of a
2099,CHAPTER VI,"young physician, and by his statement many eminent physiologists and"
2100,CHAPTER VI,"psychologists visited the town, and cross-examined the case on the spot."
2101,CHAPTER VI,"Sheets full of her ravings were taken down from her own mouth, and"
2102,CHAPTER VI,"were found to consist of sentences, coherent and intelligible each for"
2103,CHAPTER VI,"itself, but with little or no connection with each other. Of the Hebrew,"
2104,CHAPTER VI,a small portion only could be traced to the Bible; the remainder seemed
2105,CHAPTER VI,to be in the Rabbinical dialect. All trick or conspiracy was out of
2106,CHAPTER VI,"the question. Not only had the young woman ever been a harmless, simple"
2107,CHAPTER VI,creature; but she was evidently labouring under a nervous fever. In
2108,CHAPTER VI,"the town, in which she had been resident for many years as a servant in"
2109,CHAPTER VI,"different families, no solution presented itself. The young physician,"
2110,CHAPTER VI,"however, determined to trace her past life step by step; for the patient"
2111,CHAPTER VI,herself was incapable of returning a rational answer. He at length
2112,CHAPTER VI,"succeeded in discovering the place, where her parents had lived:"
2113,CHAPTER VI,"travelled thither, found them dead, but an uncle surviving; and from him"
2114,CHAPTER VI,"learned, that the patient had been charitably taken by an old Protestant"
2115,CHAPTER VI,"pastor at nine years old, and had remained with him some years, even"
2116,CHAPTER VI,"till the old man’s death. Of this pastor the uncle knew nothing, but"
2117,CHAPTER VI,"that he was a very good man. With great difficulty, and after much"
2118,CHAPTER VI,"search, our young medical philosopher discovered a niece of the"
2119,CHAPTER VI,"pastor’s, who had lived with him as his house-keeper, and had inherited"
2120,CHAPTER VI,"his effects. She remembered the girl; related, that her venerable uncle"
2121,CHAPTER VI,"had been too indulgent, and could not bear to hear the girl scolded;"
2122,CHAPTER VI,"that she was willing to have kept her, but that, after her patron’s"
2123,CHAPTER VI,"death, the girl herself refused to stay. Anxious inquiries were then,"
2124,CHAPTER VI,"of course, made concerning the pastor’s habits; and the solution of the"
2125,CHAPTER VI,"phenomenon was soon obtained. For it appeared, that it had been the old"
2126,CHAPTER VI,"man’s custom, for years, to walk up and down a passage of his house into"
2127,CHAPTER VI,"which the kitchen door opened, and to read to himself with a loud voice,"
2128,CHAPTER VI,out of his favourite books. A considerable number of these were still in
2129,CHAPTER VI,"the niece’s possession. She added, that he was a very learned man and"
2130,CHAPTER VI,a great Hebraist. Among the books were found a collection of Rabbinical
2131,CHAPTER VI,"writings, together with several of the Greek and Latin Fathers; and the"
2132,CHAPTER VI,physician succeeded in identifying so many passages with those taken
2133,CHAPTER VI,"down at the young woman’s bedside, that no doubt could remain in any"
2134,CHAPTER VI,rational mind concerning the true origin of the impressions made on her
2135,CHAPTER VI,nervous system.
2136,CHAPTER VI,
2137,CHAPTER VI,"This authenticated case furnishes both proof and instance, that reliques"
2138,CHAPTER VI,"of sensation may exist for an indefinite time in a latent state, in"
2139,CHAPTER VI,the very same order in which they were originally impressed; and as we
2140,CHAPTER VI,cannot rationally suppose the feverish state of the brain to act in any
2141,CHAPTER VI,"other way than as a stimulus, this fact (and it would not be difficult"
2142,CHAPTER VI,to adduce several of the same kind) contributes to make it even
2143,CHAPTER VI,"probable, that all thoughts are in themselves imperishable; and, that if"
2144,CHAPTER VI,"the intelligent faculty should be rendered more comprehensive, it"
2145,CHAPTER VI,"would require only a different and apportioned organization,--the body"
2146,CHAPTER VI,"celestial instead of the body terrestrial,--to bring before every human"
2147,CHAPTER VI,"soul the collective experience of its whole past existence. And this,"
2148,CHAPTER VI,"this, perchance, is the dread book of judgment, in the mysterious"
2149,CHAPTER VI,"hieroglyphics of which every idle word is recorded! Yea, in the very"
2150,CHAPTER VI,"nature of a living spirit, it may be more possible that heaven and earth"
2151,CHAPTER VI,"should pass away, than that a single act, a single thought, should be"
2152,CHAPTER VI,"loosened or lost from that living chain of causes, with all the links of"
2153,CHAPTER VI,"which, conscious or unconscious, the free-will, our only absolute Self,"
2154,CHAPTER VI,is coextensive and co-present. But not now dare I longer discourse of
2155,CHAPTER VI,"this, waiting for a loftier mood, and a nobler subject, warned from"
2156,CHAPTER VI,"within and from without, that it is profanation to speak of these"
2157,CHAPTER VI,"“mysteries tois maede phantasteisin, os kalon to taes dikaiosynaes kai"
2158,CHAPTER VI,"sophrosynaes prosopon, kai oute hesperos oute eoos outo kala. To gar"

2163,CHAPTER VI,the countenance of justice and wisdom; and that neither the morning nor
2164,CHAPTER VI,"the evening star are so fair. For in order to direct the view aright,"
2165,CHAPTER VI,it behoves that the beholder should have made himself congenerous and
2166,CHAPTER VI,"similar to the object beheld. Never could the eye have beheld the sun,"
2167,CHAPTER VI,"had not its own essence been soliform,” (i.e. pre-configured to light"
2168,CHAPTER VI,by a similarity of essence with that of light) “neither can a soul not
2169,CHAPTER VI,beautiful attain to an intuition of beauty.”

2180,CHAPTER VII,We will pass by the utter incompatibility of such a law--if law it may
2181,CHAPTER VII,"be called, which would itself be a slave of chances--with even that"
2182,CHAPTER VII,appearance of rationality forced upon us by the outward phaenomena of
2183,CHAPTER VII,"human conduct, abstracted from our own consciousness. We will agree"
2184,CHAPTER VII,"to forget this for the moment, in order to fix our attention on that"
2185,CHAPTER VII,"subordination of final to efficient causes in the human being, which"
2186,CHAPTER VII,"flows of necessity from the assumption, that the will and, with the"
2187,CHAPTER VII,"will, all acts of thought and attention are parts and products of this"
2188,CHAPTER VII,"blind mechanism, instead of being distinct powers, the function of"
2189,CHAPTER VII,"which it is to control, determine, and modify the phantasmal chaos"
2190,CHAPTER VII,"of association. The soul becomes a mere ens logicum; for, as a real"
2191,CHAPTER VII,"separable being, it would be more worthless and ludicrous than the"
2192,CHAPTER VII,"Grimalkins in the cat-harpsichord, described in the Spectator. For these"
2193,CHAPTER VII,"did form a part of the process; but, to Hartley’s scheme, the soul is"
2194,CHAPTER VII,"present only to be pinched or stroked, while the very squeals or purring"
2195,CHAPTER VII,are produced by an agency wholly independent and alien. It involves all
2196,CHAPTER VII,"the difficulties, all the incomprehensibility (if it be not indeed, os"
2197,CHAPTER VII,"emoige dokei, the absurdity), of intercommunion between substances"
2198,CHAPTER VII,"that have no one property in common, without any of the convenient"
2199,CHAPTER VII,consequences that bribed the judgment to the admission of the Dualistic
2200,CHAPTER VII,"hypothesis. Accordingly, this caput mortuum of the Hartleian process has"
2201,CHAPTER VII,"been rejected by his followers, and the consciousness considered as a"
2202,CHAPTER VII,"result, as a tune, the common product of the breeze and the harp"
2203,CHAPTER VII,though this again is the mere remotion of one absurdity to make way
2204,CHAPTER VII,"for another, equally preposterous. For what is harmony but a mode of"
2205,CHAPTER VII,"relation, the very esse of which is percipi?--an ens rationale, which"
2206,CHAPTER VII,"pre-supposes the power, that by perceiving creates it? The razor’s edge"
2207,CHAPTER VII,becomes a saw to the armed vision; and the delicious melodies of Purcell
2208,CHAPTER VII,"or Cimarosa might be disjointed stammerings to a hearer, whose partition"
2209,CHAPTER VII,of time should be a thousand times subtler than ours. But this obstacle
2210,CHAPTER VII,"too let us imagine ourselves to have surmounted, and “at one bound high"
2211,CHAPTER VII,"overleap all bound.” Yet according to this hypothesis the disquisition,"
2212,CHAPTER VII,"to which I am at present soliciting the reader’s attention, may be as"
2213,CHAPTER VII,"truly said to be written by Saint Paul’s church, as by me: for it is the"
2214,CHAPTER VII,mere motion of my muscles and nerves; and these again are set in motion
2215,CHAPTER VII,"from external causes equally passive, which external causes stand"
2216,CHAPTER VII,themselves in interdependent connection with every thing that exists or
2217,CHAPTER VII,has existed. Thus the whole universe co-operates to produce the minutest
2218,CHAPTER VII,"stroke of every letter, save only that I myself, and I alone, have"
2219,CHAPTER VII,"nothing to do with it, but merely the causeless and effectless beholding"
2220,CHAPTER VII,of it when it is done. Yet scarcely can it be called a beholding; for
2221,CHAPTER VII,it is neither an act nor an effect; but an impossible creation of a
2222,CHAPTER VII,something nothing out of its very contrary! It is the mere quick-silver
2223,CHAPTER VII,plating behind a looking-glass; and in this alone consists the poor
2224,CHAPTER VII,"worthless I! The sum total of my moral and intellectual intercourse,"
2225,CHAPTER VII,"dissolved into its elements, is reduced to extension, motion, degrees"
2226,CHAPTER VII,"of velocity, and those diminished copies of configurative motion, which"
2227,CHAPTER VII,"form what we call notions, and notions of notions. Of such philosophy"
2228,CHAPTER VII,well might Butler say--
2229,CHAPTER VII,
2230,CHAPTER VII,The metaphysic’s but a puppet motion
2231,CHAPTER VII,"That goes with screws, the notion of a notion;"
2232,CHAPTER VII,The copy of a copy and lame draught
2233,CHAPTER VII,Unnaturally taken from a thought
2234,CHAPTER VII,"That counterfeits all pantomimic tricks,"
2235,CHAPTER VII,"And turns the eyes, like an old crucifix;"
2236,CHAPTER VII,That counterchanges whatsoe’er it calls
2237,CHAPTER VII,"By another name, and makes it true or false;"
2238,CHAPTER VII,"Turns truth to falsehood, falsehood into truth,"
2239,CHAPTER VII,By virtue of the Babylonian’s tooth.
2240,CHAPTER VII,
2241,CHAPTER VII,"The inventor of the watch, if this doctrine be true, did not in reality"
2242,CHAPTER VII,"invent it; he only looked on, while the blind causes, the only true"
2243,CHAPTER VII,"artists, were unfolding themselves. So must it have been too with my"
2244,CHAPTER VII,"friend Allston, when he sketched his picture of the dead man revived by"
2245,CHAPTER VII,the bones of the prophet Elijah. So must it have been with Mr. Southey
2246,CHAPTER VII,"and Lord Byron, when the one fancied himself composing his Roderick, and"
2247,CHAPTER VII,the other his Childe Harold. The same must hold good of all systems of
2248,CHAPTER VII,"philosophy; of all arts, governments, wars by sea and by land; in short,"
2249,CHAPTER VII,"of all things that ever have been or that ever will be produced. For,"
2250,CHAPTER VII,"according to this system, it is not the affections and passions that are"
2251,CHAPTER VII,"at work, in as far as they are sensations or thoughts. We only fancy,"
2252,CHAPTER VII,"that we act from rational resolves, or prudent motives, or from impulses"
2253,CHAPTER VII,"of anger, love, or generosity. In all these cases the real agent is a"
2254,CHAPTER VII,"something-nothing-everything, which does all of which we know, and knows"
2255,CHAPTER VII,nothing of all that itself does.
2256,CHAPTER VII,
2257,CHAPTER VII,"The existence of an infinite spirit, of an intelligent and holy will,"
2258,CHAPTER VII,"must, on this system, be mere articulated motions of the air. For as the"
2259,CHAPTER VII,function of the human understanding is no other than merely to appear to
2260,CHAPTER VII,itself to combine and to apply the phaenomena of the association; and
2261,CHAPTER VII,as these derive all their reality from the primary sensations; and the
2262,CHAPTER VII,sensations again all their reality from the impressions ab extra; a
2263,CHAPTER VII,"God not visible, audible, or tangible, can exist only in the sounds and"
2264,CHAPTER VII,letters that form his name and attributes. If in ourselves there be no
2265,CHAPTER VII,"such faculties as those of the will, and the scientific reason, we must"
2266,CHAPTER VII,"either have an innate idea of them, which would overthrow the whole"
2267,CHAPTER VII,"system; or we can have no idea at all. The process, by which Hume"
2268,CHAPTER VII,degraded the notion of cause and effect into a blind product of delusion
2269,CHAPTER VII,"and habit, into the mere sensation of proceeding life (nisus vitalis)"
2270,CHAPTER VII,associated with the images of the memory; this same process must be
2271,CHAPTER VII,repeated to the equal degradation of every fundamental idea in ethics or
2272,CHAPTER VII,theology.
2273,CHAPTER VII,
2274,CHAPTER VII,"Far, very far am I from burthening with the odium of these consequences"
2275,CHAPTER VII,"the moral characters of those who first formed, or have since adopted"
2276,CHAPTER VII,"the system! It is most noticeable of the excellent and pious Hartley,"
2277,CHAPTER VII,"that, in the proofs of the existence and attributes of God, with which"
2278,CHAPTER VII,"his second volume commences, he makes no reference to the principle or"
2279,CHAPTER VII,"results of the first. Nay, he assumes, as his foundations, ideas which,"
2280,CHAPTER VII,"if we embrace the doctrines of his first volume, can exist no where but"
2281,CHAPTER VII,in the vibrations of the ethereal medium common to the nerves and to the
2282,CHAPTER VII,"atmosphere. Indeed the whole of the second volume is, with the fewest"
2283,CHAPTER VII,"possible exceptions, independent of his peculiar system. So true is it,"
2284,CHAPTER VII,"that the faith, which saves and sanctifies, is a collective energy, a"
2285,CHAPTER VII,total act of the whole moral being; that its living sensorium is in the
2286,CHAPTER VII,heart; and that no errors of the understanding can be morally arraigned
2287,CHAPTER VII,"unless they have proceeded from the heart. But whether they be such, no"
2288,CHAPTER VII,"man can be certain in the case of another, scarcely perhaps even in his"
2289,CHAPTER VII,"own. Hence it follows by inevitable consequence, that man may perchance"
2290,CHAPTER VII,determine what is a heresy; but God only can know who is a heretic. It
2291,CHAPTER VII,"does not, however, by any means follow that opinions fundamentally"
2292,CHAPTER VII,false are harmless. A hundred causes may co-exist to form one complex
2293,CHAPTER VII,"antidote. Yet the sting of the adder remains venomous, though there"
2294,CHAPTER VII,"are many who have taken up the evil thing, and it hurted them not. Some"
2295,CHAPTER VII,"indeed there seem to have been, in an unfortunate neighbour nation at"
2296,CHAPTER VII,"least, who have embraced this system with a full view of all its moral"
2297,CHAPTER VII,and religious consequences; some--
2298,CHAPTER VII,
2299,CHAPTER VII,"------who deem themselves most free,"
2300,CHAPTER VII,When they within this gross and visible sphere
2301,CHAPTER VII,"Chain down the winged thought, scoffing ascent,"
2302,CHAPTER VII,Proud in their meanness; and themselves they cheat
2303,CHAPTER VII,"With noisy emptiness of learned phrase,"
2304,CHAPTER VII,"Their subtle fluids, impacts, essences,"
2305,CHAPTER VII,"Self-working tools, uncaus’d effects, and all"
2306,CHAPTER VII,"Those blind omniscients, those almighty slaves,"
2307,CHAPTER VII,Untenanting creation of its God!
2308,CHAPTER VII,
2309,CHAPTER VII,"Such men need discipline, not argument; they must be made better men,"
2310,CHAPTER VII,before they can become wiser.
2311,CHAPTER VII,
2312,CHAPTER VII,The attention will be more profitably employed in attempting to discover
2313,CHAPTER VII,"and expose the paralogisms, by the magic of which such a faith could"
2314,CHAPTER VII,"find admission into minds framed for a nobler creed. These, it appears"
2315,CHAPTER VII,"to me, may be all reduced to one sophism as their common genus; the"
2316,CHAPTER VII,mistaking the conditions of a thing for its causes and essence; and
2317,CHAPTER VII,"the process, by which we arrive at the knowledge of a faculty, for the"
2318,CHAPTER VII,"faculty itself. The air I breathe is the condition of my life, not its"
2319,CHAPTER VII,cause. We could never have learned that we had eyes but by the process
2320,CHAPTER VII,of seeing; yet having seen we know that the eyes must have pre-existed
2321,CHAPTER VII,in order to render the process of sight possible. Let us cross-examine
2322,CHAPTER VII,Hartley’s scheme under the guidance of this distinction; and we shall
2323,CHAPTER VII,"discover, that contemporaneity, (Leibnitz’s Lex Continui,) is the limit"
2324,CHAPTER VII,"and condition of the laws of mind, itself being rather a law of matter,"
2325,CHAPTER VII,"at least of phaenomena considered as material. At the utmost, it is to"
2326,CHAPTER VII,"thought the same, as the law of gravitation is to loco-motion. In every"
2327,CHAPTER VII,"voluntary movement we first counteract gravitation, in order to avail"
2328,CHAPTER VII,"ourselves of it. It must exist, that there may be a something to be"
2329,CHAPTER VII,"counteracted, and which, by its re-action, may aid the force that is"
2330,CHAPTER VII,exerted to resist it. Let us consider what we do when we leap. We first
2331,CHAPTER VII,"resist the gravitating power by an act purely voluntary, and then by"
2332,CHAPTER VII,"another act, voluntary in part, we yield to it in order to alight on the"
2333,CHAPTER VII,"spot, which we had previously proposed to ourselves. Now let a man watch"
2334,CHAPTER VII,"his mind while he is composing; or, to take a still more common case,"
2335,CHAPTER VII,while he is trying to recollect a name; and he will find the process
2336,CHAPTER VII,completely analogous. Most of my readers will have observed a small
2337,CHAPTER VII,"water-insect on the surface of rivulets, which throws a cinque-spotted"
2338,CHAPTER VII,shadow fringed with prismatic colours on the sunny bottom of the brook;
2339,CHAPTER VII,"and will have noticed, how the little animal wins its way up against the"
2340,CHAPTER VII,"stream, by alternate pulses of active and passive motion, now resisting"
2341,CHAPTER VII,"the current, and now yielding to it in order to gather strength and a"
2342,CHAPTER VII,momentary fulcrum for a further propulsion. This is no unapt emblem of
2343,CHAPTER VII,the mind’s self-experience in the act of thinking. There are evidently
2344,CHAPTER VII,"two powers at work, which relatively to each other are active and"
2345,CHAPTER VII,"passive; and this is not possible without an intermediate faculty, which"
2346,CHAPTER VII,"is at once both active and passive. In philosophical language, we"
2347,CHAPTER VII,must denominate this intermediate faculty in all its degrees and
2348,CHAPTER VII,"determinations, the IMAGINATION. But, in common language, and especially"
2349,CHAPTER VII,"on the subject of poetry, we appropriate the name to a superior degree"
2350,CHAPTER VII,"of the faculty, joined to a superior voluntary control over it."
2351,CHAPTER VII,
2352,CHAPTER VII,"Contemporaneity, then, being the common condition of all the laws of"
2353,CHAPTER VII,"association, and a component element in the materia subjecta, the"
2354,CHAPTER VII,"parts of which are to be associated, must needs be co-present with all."
2355,CHAPTER VII,"Nothing, therefore, can be more easy than to pass off on an incautious"
2356,CHAPTER VII,"mind this constant companion of each, for the essential substance of"
2357,CHAPTER VII,"all. But if we appeal to our own consciousness, we shall find that"
2358,CHAPTER VII,"even time itself, as the cause of a particular act of association, is"
2359,CHAPTER VII,"distinct from contemporaneity, as the condition of all association."
2360,CHAPTER VII,"Seeing a mackerel, it may happen, that I immediately think of"
2361,CHAPTER VII,"gooseberries, because I at the same time ate mackerel with gooseberries"
2362,CHAPTER VII,"as the sauce. The first syllable of the latter word, being that which"
2363,CHAPTER VII,"had coexisted with the image of the bird so called, I may then think"
2364,CHAPTER VII,of a goose. In the next moment the image of a swan may arise before
2365,CHAPTER VII,"me, though I had never seen the two birds together. In the first two"
2366,CHAPTER VII,"instances, I am conscious that their co-existence in time was the"
2367,CHAPTER VII,"circumstance, that enabled me to recollect them; and equally conscious"
2368,CHAPTER VII,am I that the latter was recalled to me by the joint operation of
2369,CHAPTER VII,likeness and contrast. So it is with cause and effect: so too with
2370,CHAPTER VII,"order. So I am able to distinguish whether it was proximity in time, or"
2371,CHAPTER VII,"continuity in space, that occasioned me to recall B on the mention of A."
2372,CHAPTER VII,They cannot be indeed separated from contemporaneity; for that would
2373,CHAPTER VII,be to separate them from the mind itself. The act of consciousness is
2374,CHAPTER VII,indeed identical with time considered in its essence. I mean time per
2375,CHAPTER VII,"se, as contra-distinguished from our notion of time; for this is always"
2376,CHAPTER VII,"blended with the idea of space, which, as the opposite of time, is"
2377,CHAPTER VII,therefore its measure. Nevertheless the accident of seeing two objects
2378,CHAPTER VII,"at the same moment, and the accident of seeing them in the same place"
2379,CHAPTER VII,are two distinct or distinguishable causes: and the true practical
2380,CHAPTER VII,general law of association is this; that whatever makes certain parts of
2381,CHAPTER VII,"a total impression more vivid or distinct than the rest, will determine"
2382,CHAPTER VII,the mind to recall these in preference to others equally linked together
2383,CHAPTER VII,"by the common condition of contemporaneity, or (what I deem a more"
2384,CHAPTER VII,appropriate and philosophical term) of continuity. But the will itself
2385,CHAPTER VII,by confining and intensifying [25] the attention may arbitrarily give
2386,CHAPTER VII,vividness or distinctness to any object whatsoever; and from hence we
2387,CHAPTER VII,"may deduce the uselessness, if not the absurdity, of certain recent"
2388,CHAPTER VII,"schemes which promise an artificial memory, but which in reality can"
2389,CHAPTER VII,"only produce a confusion and debasement of the fancy. Sound logic, as"
2390,CHAPTER VII,"the habitual subordination of the individual to the species, and of"
2391,CHAPTER VII,the species to the genus; philosophical knowledge of facts under the
2392,CHAPTER VII,relation of cause and effect; a cheerful and communicative temper
2393,CHAPTER VII,"disposing us to notice the similarities and contrasts of things, that"
2394,CHAPTER VII,we may be able to illustrate the one by the other; a quiet conscience;
2395,CHAPTER VII,"a condition free from anxieties; sound health, and above all (as far as"
2396,CHAPTER VII,"relates to passive remembrance) a healthy digestion; these are the best,"
2397,CHAPTER VII,these are the only Arts of Memory.

2404,CHAPTER VIII,The system of Dualism introduced by Des Cartes--Refined first by
2405,CHAPTER VIII,Spinoza and afterwards by Leibnitz into the doctrine of Harmonia
2406,CHAPTER VIII,"praestabilita--Hylozoism--Materialism--None of these systems, or any"
2407,CHAPTER VIII,"possible theory of association, supplies or supersedes a theory of"
2408,CHAPTER VIII,"perception, or explains the formation of the associable."
2409,CHAPTER VIII,
2410,CHAPTER VIII,
2411,CHAPTER VIII,To the best of my knowledge Des Cartes was the first philosopher who
2412,CHAPTER VIII,introduced the absolute and essential heterogenity of the soul as
2413,CHAPTER VIII,"intelligence, and the body as matter. The assumption, and the form of"
2414,CHAPTER VIII,"speaking have remained, though the denial of all other properties"
2415,CHAPTER VIII,"to matter but that of extension, on which denial the whole system of"
2416,CHAPTER VIII,"Dualism is grounded, has been long exploded. For since impenetrability"
2417,CHAPTER VIII,is intelligible only as a mode of resistance; its admission places the
2418,CHAPTER VIII,"essence of matter in an act or power, which it possesses in common"
2419,CHAPTER VIII,with spirit; and body and spirit are therefore no longer absolutely
2420,CHAPTER VIII,"heterogeneous, but may without any absurdity be supposed to be different"
2421,CHAPTER VIII,"modes, or degrees in perfection, of a common substratum. To this"
2422,CHAPTER VIII,"possibility, however, it was not the fashion to advert. The soul was a"
2423,CHAPTER VIII,"thinking substance, and body a space-filling substance. Yet the apparent"
2424,CHAPTER VIII,action of each on the other pressed heavy on the philosopher on the one
2425,CHAPTER VIII,"hand; and no less heavily on the other hand pressed the evident truth,"
2426,CHAPTER VIII,"that the law of causality holds only between homogeneous things, that"
2427,CHAPTER VIII,"is, things having some common property; and cannot extend from one world"
2428,CHAPTER VIII,"into another, its contrary. A close analysis evinced it to be no less"
2429,CHAPTER VIII,absurd than the question whether a man’s affection for his wife lay
2430,CHAPTER VIII,"North-east, or South-west of the love he bore towards his child."
2431,CHAPTER VIII,Leibnitz’s doctrine of a pre-established harmony; which he certainly
2432,CHAPTER VIII,"borrowed from Spinoza, who had himself taken the hint from Des Cartes’s"
2433,CHAPTER VIII,"animal machines, was in its common interpretation too strange to survive"
2434,CHAPTER VIII,the inventor--too repugnant to our common sense; which is not indeed
2435,CHAPTER VIII,entitled to a judicial voice in the courts of scientific philosophy;
2436,CHAPTER VIII,"but whose whispers still exert a strong secret influence. Even Wolf,"
2437,CHAPTER VIII,"the admirer and illustrious systematizer of the Leibnitzian doctrine,"
2438,CHAPTER VIII,"contents himself with defending the possibility of the idea, but does"
2439,CHAPTER VIII,not adopt it as a part of the edifice.
2440,CHAPTER VIII,
2441,CHAPTER VIII,"The hypothesis of Hylozoism, on the other side, is the death of all"
2442,CHAPTER VIII,"rational physiology, and indeed of all physical science; for that"
2443,CHAPTER VIII,"requires a limitation of terms, and cannot consist with the arbitrary"
2444,CHAPTER VIII,"power of multiplying attributes by occult qualities. Besides, it answers"
2445,CHAPTER VIII,"no purpose; unless, indeed, a difficulty can be solved by multiplying"
2446,CHAPTER VIII,"it, or we can acquire a clearer notion of our soul by being told that we"
2447,CHAPTER VIII,"have a million of souls, and that every atom of our bodies has a soul"
2448,CHAPTER VIII,"of its own. Far more prudent is it to admit the difficulty once for all,"
2449,CHAPTER VIII,and then let it lie at rest. There is a sediment indeed at the bottom
2450,CHAPTER VIII,"of the vessel, but all the water above it is clear and transparent. The"
2451,CHAPTER VIII,"Hylozoist only shakes it up, and renders the whole turbid."
2452,CHAPTER VIII,
2453,CHAPTER VIII,"But it is not either the nature of man, or the duty of the philosopher"
2454,CHAPTER VIII,"to despair concerning any important problem until, as in the squaring of"
2455,CHAPTER VIII,"the circle, the impossibility of a solution has been demonstrated. How"
2456,CHAPTER VIII,"the esse assumed as originally distinct from the scire, can ever unite"
2457,CHAPTER VIII,"itself with it; how being can transform itself into a knowing, becomes"
2458,CHAPTER VIII,"conceivable on one only condition; namely, if it can be shown that the"
2459,CHAPTER VIII,"vis representativa, or the Sentient, is itself a species of being;"
2460,CHAPTER VIII,"that is, either as a property or attribute, or as an hypostasis or self"
2461,CHAPTER VIII,subsistence. The former--that thinking is a property of matter under
2462,CHAPTER VIII,"particular conditions,--is, indeed, the assumption of materialism; a"
2463,CHAPTER VIII,"system which could not but be patronized by the philosopher, if only it"
2464,CHAPTER VIII,actually performed what it promises. But how any affection from without
2465,CHAPTER VIII,"can metamorphose itself into perception or will, the materialist has"
2466,CHAPTER VIII,"hitherto left, not only as incomprehensible as he found it, but has"
2467,CHAPTER VIII,"aggravated it into a comprehensible absurdity. For, grant that an object"
2468,CHAPTER VIII,"from without could act upon the conscious self, as on a consubstantial"
2469,CHAPTER VIII,object; yet such an affection could only engender something homogeneous
2470,CHAPTER VIII,with itself. Motion could only propagate motion. Matter has no Inward.
2471,CHAPTER VIII,"We remove one surface, but to meet with another. We can but divide"
2472,CHAPTER VIII,a particle into particles; and each atom comprehends in itself the
2473,CHAPTER VIII,properties of the material universe. Let any reflecting mind make
2474,CHAPTER VIII,the experiment of explaining to itself the evidence of our sensuous
2475,CHAPTER VIII,"intuitions, from the hypothesis that in any given perception there is"
2476,CHAPTER VIII,"a something which has been communicated to it by an impact, or"
2477,CHAPTER VIII,"an impression ab extra. In the first place, by the impact on the"
2478,CHAPTER VIII,"percipient, or ens representans, not the object itself, but only its"
2479,CHAPTER VIII,"action or effect, will pass into the same. Not the iron tongue, but"
2480,CHAPTER VIII,"its vibrations, pass into the metal of the bell. Now in our immediate"
2481,CHAPTER VIII,"perception, it is not the mere power or act of the object, but the"
2482,CHAPTER VIII,"object itself, which is immediately present. We might indeed attempt to"
2483,CHAPTER VIII,"explain this result by a chain of deductions and conclusions; but that,"
2484,CHAPTER VIII,"first, the very faculty of deducing and concluding would equally"
2485,CHAPTER VIII,"demand an explanation; and secondly, that there exists in fact no such"
2486,CHAPTER VIII,"intermediation by logical notions, such as those of cause and effect. It"
2487,CHAPTER VIII,"is the object itself, not the product of a syllogism, which is present"
2488,CHAPTER VIII,to our consciousness. Or would we explain this supervention of the
2489,CHAPTER VIII,"object to the sensation, by a productive faculty set in motion by"
2490,CHAPTER VIII,"an impulse; still the transition, into the percipient, of the object"
2491,CHAPTER VIII,"itself, from which the impulse proceeded, assumes a power that can"
2492,CHAPTER VIII,"permeate and wholly possess the soul,"
2493,CHAPTER VIII,
2494,CHAPTER VIII,"And like a God by spiritual art,"
2495,CHAPTER VIII,"Be all in all, and all in every part."
2496,CHAPTER VIII,
2497,CHAPTER VIII,And how came the percipient here? And what is become of the
2498,CHAPTER VIII,"wonder-promising Matter, that was to perform all these marvels by force"
2499,CHAPTER VIII,"of mere figure, weight and motion? The most consistent proceeding of"
2500,CHAPTER VIII,the dogmatic materialist is to fall back into the common rank of
2501,CHAPTER VIII,"soul-and-bodyists; to affect the mysterious, and declare the whole"
2502,CHAPTER VIII,"process a revelation given, and not to be understood, which it would be"
2503,CHAPTER VIII,profane to examine too closely. Datur non intelligitur. But a
2504,CHAPTER VIII,"revelation unconfirmed by miracles, and a faith not commanded by the"
2505,CHAPTER VIII,"conscience, a philosopher may venture to pass by, without suspecting"
2506,CHAPTER VIII,himself of any irreligious tendency.
2507,CHAPTER VIII,
2508,CHAPTER VIII,"Thus, as materialism has been generally taught, it is utterly"
2509,CHAPTER VIII,"unintelligible, and owes all its proselytes to the propensity so common"
2510,CHAPTER VIII,"among men, to mistake distinct images for clear conceptions; and vice"
2511,CHAPTER VIII,"versa, to reject as inconceivable whatever from its own nature is"
2512,CHAPTER VIII,"unimaginable. But as soon as it becomes intelligible, it ceases to be"
2513,CHAPTER VIII,"materialism. In order to explain thinking, as a material phaenomenon, it"
2514,CHAPTER VIII,"is necessary to refine matter into a mere modification of intelligence,"
2515,CHAPTER VIII,with the two-fold function of appearing and perceiving. Even so did
2516,CHAPTER VIII,Priestley in his controversy with Price. He stripped matter of all its
2517,CHAPTER VIII,material properties; substituted spiritual powers; and when we expected
2518,CHAPTER VIII,"to find a body, behold! we had nothing but its ghost--the apparition of"
2519,CHAPTER VIII,a defunct substance!
2520,CHAPTER VIII,
2521,CHAPTER VIII,"I shall not dilate further on this subject; because it will, (if God"
2522,CHAPTER VIII,"grant health and permission), be treated of at large and systematically"
2523,CHAPTER VIII,"in a work, which I have many years been preparing, on the Productive"
2524,CHAPTER VIII,"Logos human and divine; with, and as the introduction to, a full"
2525,CHAPTER VIII,commentary on the Gospel of St. John. To make myself intelligible as
2526,CHAPTER VIII,"far as my present subject requires, it will be sufficient briefly to"
2527,CHAPTER VIII,observe.--1. That all association demands and presupposes the existence
2528,CHAPTER VIII,of the thoughts and images to be associated.--2. That the hypothesis of
2529,CHAPTER VIII,an external world exactly correspondent to those images or modifications
2530,CHAPTER VIII,"of our own being, which alone, according to this system, we actually"
2531,CHAPTER VIII,"behold, is as thorough idealism as Berkeley’s, inasmuch as it equally,"
2532,CHAPTER VIII,"perhaps in a more perfect degree, removes all reality and immediateness"
2533,CHAPTER VIII,"of perception, and places us in a dream-world of phantoms and spectres,"
2534,CHAPTER VIII,the inexplicable swarm and equivocal generation of motions in our own
2535,CHAPTER VIII,"brains.--3. That this hypothesis neither involves the explanation, nor"
2536,CHAPTER VIII,"precludes the necessity, of a mechanism and co-adequate forces in the"
2537,CHAPTER VIII,"percipient, which at the more than magic touch of the impulse from"
2538,CHAPTER VIII,without is to create anew for itself the correspondent object. The
2539,CHAPTER VIII,formation of a copy is not solved by the mere pre-existence of an
2540,CHAPTER VIII,original; the copyist of Raffael’s Transfiguration must repeat more or
2541,CHAPTER VIII,less perfectly the process of Raffael. It would be easy to explain a
2542,CHAPTER VIII,"thought from the image on the retina, and that from the geometry of"
2543,CHAPTER VIII,"light, if this very light did not present the very same difficulty."
2544,CHAPTER VIII,We might as rationally chant the Brahim creed of the tortoise that
2545,CHAPTER VIII,"supported the bear, that supported the elephant, that supported the"
2546,CHAPTER VIII,"world, to the tune of “This is the house that Jack built.” The sic"
2547,CHAPTER VIII,"Deo placitum est we all admit as the sufficient cause, and the divine"
2548,CHAPTER VIII,goodness as the sufficient reason; but an answer to the Whence and Why
2549,CHAPTER VIII,"is no answer to the How, which alone is the physiologist’s concern."
2550,CHAPTER VIII,"It is a sophisma pigrum, and (as Bacon hath said) the arrogance of"
2551,CHAPTER VIII,"pusillanimity, which lifts up the idol of a mortal’s fancy and commands"
2552,CHAPTER VIII,"us to fall down and worship it, as a work of divine wisdom, an ancile or"
2553,CHAPTER VIII,palladium fallen from heaven. By the very same argument the supporters
2554,CHAPTER VIII,"of the Ptolemaic system might have rebuffed the Newtonian, and pointing"
2555,CHAPTER VIII,"to the sky with self-complacent grin [26] have appealed to common sense,"
2556,CHAPTER VIII,whether the sun did not move and the earth stand still.

2575,CHAPTER IX,"for my reason, I began to ask myself; is a system of philosophy; as"
2576,CHAPTER IX,"different from mere history and historic classification, possible? If"
2577,CHAPTER IX,"possible, what are its necessary conditions? I was for a while disposed"
2578,CHAPTER IX,"to answer the first question in the negative, and to admit that the sole"
2579,CHAPTER IX,"practicable employment for the human mind was to observe, to collect,"
2580,CHAPTER IX,"and to classify. But I soon felt, that human nature itself fought up"
2581,CHAPTER IX,"against this wilful resignation of intellect; and as soon did I find,"
2582,CHAPTER IX,"that the scheme, taken with all its consequences and cleared of all"
2583,CHAPTER IX,"inconsistencies, was not less impracticable than contranatural. Assume"
2584,CHAPTER IX,"in its full extent the position, nihil in intellectu quod non prius"
2585,CHAPTER IX,"in sensu, assume it without Leibnitz’s qualifying praeter ipsum"
2586,CHAPTER IX,"intellectum, and in the same sense, in which the position was understood"
2587,CHAPTER IX,by Hartley and Condillac: and then what Hume had demonstratively deduced
2588,CHAPTER IX,"from this concession concerning cause and effect, will apply with equal"
2589,CHAPTER IX,"and crushing force to all the other eleven categorical forms [27], and"
2590,CHAPTER IX,the logical functions corresponding to them. How can we make bricks
2591,CHAPTER IX,without straw;--or build without cement? We learn all things indeed by
2592,CHAPTER IX,occasion of experience; but the very facts so learned force us inward on
2593,CHAPTER IX,"the antecedents, that must be presupposed in order to render experience"
2594,CHAPTER IX,"itself possible. The first book of Locke’s Essay, (if the supposed"
2595,CHAPTER IX,"error, which it labours to subvert, be not a mere thing of straw, an"
2596,CHAPTER IX,"absurdity which, no man ever did, or indeed ever could, believe,) is"

2600,CHAPTER IX,"The term, Philosophy, defines itself as an affectionate seeking after"

2602,CHAPTER IX,"conceivable, but by assuming as a postulate, that both are ab initio,"
2603,CHAPTER IX,identical and coinherent; that intelligence and being are reciprocally
2604,CHAPTER IX,"each other’s substrate. I presumed that this was a possible conception,"
2605,CHAPTER IX,"(i.e. that it involved no logical inconsonance,) from the length of time"
2606,CHAPTER IX,"during which the scholastic definition of the Supreme Being, as actus"
2607,CHAPTER IX,"purissimus sine ulla potentialitate, was received in the schools of"
2608,CHAPTER IX,"Theology, both by the Pontifician and the Reformed divines. The early"
2609,CHAPTER IX,"study of Plato and Plotinus, with the commentaries and the THEOLOGIA"
2610,CHAPTER IX,"PLATONICA of the illustrious Florentine; of Proclus, and Gemistius"
2611,CHAPTER IX,Pletho; and at a later period of the De Immenso et Innumerabili and the
2612,CHAPTER IX,"“De la causa, principio et uno,” of the philosopher of Nola, who could"
2613,CHAPTER IX,"boast of a Sir Philip Sidney and Fulke Greville among his patrons, and"
2614,CHAPTER IX,whom the idolaters of Rome burnt as an atheist in the year 1600; had all
2615,CHAPTER IX,contributed to prepare my mind for the reception and welcoming of the
2616,CHAPTER IX,"Cogito quia Sum, et Sum quia Cogito; a philosophy of seeming hardihood,"

2620,CHAPTER IX,Why need I be afraid? Say rather how dare I be ashamed of the Teutonic
2621,CHAPTER IX,"theosophist, Jacob Behmen? Many, indeed, and gross were his delusions;"
2622,CHAPTER IX,and such as furnish frequent and ample occasion for the triumph of
2623,CHAPTER IX,"the learned over the poor ignorant shoemaker, who had dared think for"
2624,CHAPTER IX,"himself. But while we remember that these delusions were such, as might"
2625,CHAPTER IX,"be anticipated from his utter want of all intellectual discipline, and"
2626,CHAPTER IX,"from his ignorance of rational psychology, let it not be forgotten that"
2627,CHAPTER IX,the latter defect he had in common with the most learned theologians
2628,CHAPTER IX,"of his age. Neither with books, nor with book-learned men was he"
2629,CHAPTER IX,"conversant. A meek and shy quietest, his intellectual powers were never"
2630,CHAPTER IX,"stimulated into feverous energy by crowds of proselytes, or by the"
2631,CHAPTER IX,"ambition of proselyting. Jacob Behmen was an enthusiast, in"
2632,CHAPTER IX,"the strictest sense, as not merely distinguished, but as"
2633,CHAPTER IX,"contra-distinguished, from a fanatic. While I in part translate the"
2634,CHAPTER IX,"following observations from a contemporary writer of the Continent, let"
2635,CHAPTER IX,"me be permitted to premise, that I might have transcribed the substance"
2636,CHAPTER IX,"from memoranda of my own, which were written many years before his"
2637,CHAPTER IX,pamphlet was given to the world; and that I prefer another’s words to my
2638,CHAPTER IX,"own, partly as a tribute due to priority of publication; but still"
2639,CHAPTER IX,more from the pleasure of sympathy in a case where coincidence only was
2640,CHAPTER IX,possible.
2641,CHAPTER IX,
2642,CHAPTER IX,"Whoever is acquainted with the history of philosophy, during the last"
2643,CHAPTER IX,"two or three centuries, cannot but admit that there appears to have"
2644,CHAPTER IX,"existed a sort of secret and tacit compact among the learned, not to"
2645,CHAPTER IX,pass beyond a certain limit in speculative science. The privilege of
2646,CHAPTER IX,"free thought, so highly extolled, has at no time been held valid in"
2647,CHAPTER IX,"actual practice, except within this limit; and not a single stride"
2648,CHAPTER IX,beyond it has ever been ventured without bringing obloquy on the
2649,CHAPTER IX,"transgressor. The few men of genius among the learned class, who"
2650,CHAPTER IX,"actually did overstep this boundary, anxiously avoided the appearance of"
2651,CHAPTER IX,"having so done. Therefore the true depth of science, and the penetration"
2652,CHAPTER IX,"to the inmost centre, from which all the lines of knowledge diverge to"
2653,CHAPTER IX,"their ever distant circumference, was abandoned to the illiterate and"
2654,CHAPTER IX,"the simple, whom unstilled yearning, and an original ebulliency of"
2655,CHAPTER IX,"spirit, had urged to the investigation of the indwelling and living"
2656,CHAPTER IX,"ground of all things. These, then, because their names had never been"
2657,CHAPTER IX,"enrolled in the guilds of the learned, were persecuted by the registered"
2658,CHAPTER IX,livery-men as interlopers on their rights and privileges. All without
2659,CHAPTER IX,"distinction were branded as fanatics and phantasts; not only those,"
2660,CHAPTER IX,whose wild and exorbitant imaginations had actually engendered only
2661,CHAPTER IX,"extravagant and grotesque phantasms, and whose productions were, for the"
2662,CHAPTER IX,"most part, poor copies and gross caricatures of genuine inspiration; but"
2663,CHAPTER IX,"the truly inspired likewise, the originals themselves. And this for no"
2664,CHAPTER IX,"other reason, but because they were the unlearned, men of humble"
2665,CHAPTER IX,"and obscure occupations. When, and from whom among the literati by"
2666,CHAPTER IX,"profession, have we ever heard the divine doxology repeated, I thank"
2667,CHAPTER IX,"thee, O Father! Lord of Heaven and Earth! because thou hast hid these"
2668,CHAPTER IX,"things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes"
2669,CHAPTER IX,[28]. No; the haughty priests of learning not only banished from the
2670,CHAPTER IX,schools and marts of science all who had dared draw living waters from
2671,CHAPTER IX,"the fountain, but drove them out of the very Temple, which mean time the"
2672,CHAPTER IX,"buyers, and sellers, and money-changers were suffered to make a den of"
2673,CHAPTER IX,thieves.
2674,CHAPTER IX,
2675,CHAPTER IX,And yet it would not be easy to discover any substantial ground for
2676,CHAPTER IX,"this contemptuous pride in those literati, who have most distinguished"
2677,CHAPTER IX,"themselves by their scorn of Behmen, Thaulerus, George Fox, and others;"
2678,CHAPTER IX,"unless it be, that they could write orthographically, make smooth"
2679,CHAPTER IX,"periods, and had the fashions of authorship almost literally at their"
2680,CHAPTER IX,"fingers’ ends, while the latter, in simplicity of soul, made their words"
2681,CHAPTER IX,immediate echoes of their feelings. Hence the frequency of those
2682,CHAPTER IX,"phrases among them, which have been mistaken for pretences to immediate"
2683,CHAPTER IX,"inspiration; as for instance, “It was delivered unto me;”--“I strove"
2684,CHAPTER IX,"not to speak;”-“I said, I will be silent;”--“But the word was in my"
2685,CHAPTER IX,heart as a burning fire;”--“and I could not forbear.” Hence too the
2686,CHAPTER IX,"unwillingness to give offence; hence the foresight, and the dread of the"
2687,CHAPTER IX,"clamours, which would be raised against them, so frequently avowed in"
2688,CHAPTER IX,"the writings of these men, and expressed, as was natural, in the words"
2689,CHAPTER IX,"of the only book, with which they were familiar [29]. “Woe is me that I"
2690,CHAPTER IX,"am become a man of strife, and a man of contention,--I love peace: the"
2691,CHAPTER IX,souls of men are dear unto me: yet because I seek for light every one
2692,CHAPTER IX,"of them doth curse me!” O! it requires deeper feeling, and a stronger"
2693,CHAPTER IX,"imagination, than belong to most of those, to whom reasoning and fluent"
2694,CHAPTER IX,"expression have been as a trade learnt in boyhood, to conceive with what"
2695,CHAPTER IX,"might, with what inward strivings and commotion, the perception of a"
2696,CHAPTER IX,new and vital truth takes possession of an uneducated man of genius.
2697,CHAPTER IX,"His meditations are almost inevitably employed on the eternal, or the"
2698,CHAPTER IX,"everlasting; for “the world is not his friend, nor the world’s law.”"
2699,CHAPTER IX,"Need we then be surprised, that, under an excitement at once so strong"
2700,CHAPTER IX,"and so unusual, the man’s body should sympathize with the struggles of"
2701,CHAPTER IX,"his mind; or that he should at times be so far deluded, as to mistake"
2702,CHAPTER IX,"the tumultuous sensations of his nerves, and the co-existing spectres of"
2703,CHAPTER IX,"his fancy, as parts or symbols of the truths which were opening on"
2704,CHAPTER IX,"him? It has indeed been plausibly observed, that in order to derive any"
2705,CHAPTER IX,"advantage, or to collect any intelligible meaning, from the writings"
2706,CHAPTER IX,"of these ignorant Mystics, the reader must bring with him a spirit and"
2707,CHAPTER IX,judgment superior to that of the writers themselves:
2708,CHAPTER IX,
2709,CHAPTER IX,"And what he brings, what needs he elsewhere seek?"
2710,CHAPTER IX,
2711,CHAPTER IX,"--a sophism, which I fully agree with Warburton, is unworthy of Milton;"
2712,CHAPTER IX,"how much more so of the awful Person, in whose mouth he has placed it?"
2713,CHAPTER IX,"One assertion I will venture to make, as suggested by my own experience,"
2714,CHAPTER IX,"that there exist folios on the human understanding, and the nature"
2715,CHAPTER IX,"of man, which would have a far juster claim to their high rank and"
2716,CHAPTER IX,"celebrity, if in the whole huge volume there could be found as much"
2717,CHAPTER IX,"fulness of heart and intellect, as burst forth in many a simple page of"
2718,CHAPTER IX,"George Fox, Jacob Behmen, and even of Behmen’s commentator, the pious"
2719,CHAPTER IX,and fervid William Law.
2720,CHAPTER IX,
2721,CHAPTER IX,"The feeling of gratitude, which I cherish toward these men, has caused"
2722,CHAPTER IX,me to digress further than I had foreseen or proposed; but to have
2723,CHAPTER IX,passed them over in an historical sketch of my literary life and
2724,CHAPTER IX,"opinions, would have seemed to me like the denial of a debt, the"
2725,CHAPTER IX,concealment of a boon. For the writings of these Mystics acted in
2726,CHAPTER IX,no slight degree to prevent my mind from being imprisoned within the
2727,CHAPTER IX,outline of any single dogmatic system. They contributed to keep alive
2728,CHAPTER IX,"the heart in the head; gave me an indistinct, yet stirring and working"
2729,CHAPTER IX,"presentiment, that all the products of the mere reflective faculty"
2730,CHAPTER IX,"partook of death, and were as the rattling twigs and sprays in winter,"
2731,CHAPTER IX,into which a sap was yet to be propelled from some root to which I had
2732,CHAPTER IX,"not penetrated, if they were to afford my soul either food or shelter."
2733,CHAPTER IX,"If they were too often a moving cloud of smoke to me by day, yet they"
2734,CHAPTER IX,"were always a pillar of fire throughout the night, during my wanderings"
2735,CHAPTER IX,"through the wilderness of doubt, and enabled me to skirt, without"
2736,CHAPTER IX,"crossing, the sandy deserts of utter unbelief. That the system is"
2737,CHAPTER IX,"capable of being converted into an irreligious Pantheism, I well know."
2738,CHAPTER IX,"The Ethics of Spinoza, may, or may not, be an instance. But at no time"
2739,CHAPTER IX,"could I believe, that in itself and essentially it is incompatible with"
2740,CHAPTER IX,"religion, natural or revealed: and now I am most thoroughly persuaded of"
2741,CHAPTER IX,"the contrary. The writings of the illustrious sage of Koenigsberg, the"
2742,CHAPTER IX,"founder of the Critical Philosophy, more than any other work, at once"
2743,CHAPTER IX,"invigorated and disciplined my understanding. The originality, the"
2744,CHAPTER IX,"depth, and the compression of the thoughts; the novelty and subtlety,"
2745,CHAPTER IX,yet solidity and importance of the distinctions; the adamantine chain
2746,CHAPTER IX,of the logic; and I will venture to add--(paradox as it will appear to
2747,CHAPTER IX,those who have taken their notion of Immanuel Kant from Reviewers and
2748,CHAPTER IX,"Frenchmen)--the clearness and evidence, of the Critique of the Pure"
2749,CHAPTER IX,Reason; and Critique of the Judgment; of the Metaphysical Elements
2750,CHAPTER IX,of Natural Philosophy; and of his Religion within the bounds of Pure
2751,CHAPTER IX,"Reason, took possession of me as with the giant’s hand. After fifteen"
2752,CHAPTER IX,"years’ familiarity with them, I still read these and all his other"
2753,CHAPTER IX,productions with undiminished delight and increasing admiration. The few
2754,CHAPTER IX,"passages that remained obscure to me, after due efforts of thought, (as"
2755,CHAPTER IX,"the chapter on original apperception,) and the apparent contradictions"
2756,CHAPTER IX,"which occur, I soon found were hints and insinuations referring to"
2757,CHAPTER IX,"ideas, which KANT either did not think it prudent to avow, or which he"
2758,CHAPTER IX,"considered as consistently left behind in a pure analysis, not of human"
2759,CHAPTER IX,"nature in toto, but of the speculative intellect alone. Here therefore"
2760,CHAPTER IX,"he was constrained to commence at the point of reflection, or natural"
2761,CHAPTER IX,consciousness: while in his moral system he was permitted to assume a
2762,CHAPTER IX,higher ground (the autonomy of the will) as a postulate deducible from
2763,CHAPTER IX,"the unconditional command, or (in the technical language of his school)"
2764,CHAPTER IX,"the categorical imperative, of the conscience. He had been in imminent"
2765,CHAPTER IX,"danger of persecution during the reign of the late king of Prussia, that"
2766,CHAPTER IX,strange compound of lawless debauchery and priest-ridden superstition:
2767,CHAPTER IX,"and it is probable that he had little inclination, in his old age,"
2768,CHAPTER IX,"to act over again the fortunes, and hair-breadth escapes of Wolf. The"
2769,CHAPTER IX,"expulsion of the first among Kant’s disciples, who attempted to complete"
2770,CHAPTER IX,"his system, from the University of Jena, with the confiscation and"
2771,CHAPTER IX,prohibition of the obnoxious work by the joint efforts of the courts of
2772,CHAPTER IX,"Saxony and Hanover, supplied experimental proof, that the venerable"
2773,CHAPTER IX,old man’s caution was not groundless. In spite therefore of his own
2774,CHAPTER IX,"declarations, I could never believe, that it was possible for him to"
2775,CHAPTER IX,"have meant no more by his Noumenon, or Thing in itself, than his mere"
2776,CHAPTER IX,words express; or that in his own conception he confined the whole
2777,CHAPTER IX,"plastic power to the forms of the intellect, leaving for the external"
2778,CHAPTER IX,"cause, for the materiale of our sensations, a matter without form, which"
2779,CHAPTER IX,"is doubtless inconceivable. I entertained doubts likewise, whether, in"
2780,CHAPTER IX,"his own mind, he even laid all the stress, which he appears to do, on"
2781,CHAPTER IX,the moral postulates.
2782,CHAPTER IX,
2783,CHAPTER IX,"An idea, in the highest sense of that word, cannot be conveyed but by"
2784,CHAPTER IX,"a symbol; and, except in geometry, all symbols of necessity involve an"
2785,CHAPTER IX,apparent contradiction. Phonaese synetoisin: and for those who could
2786,CHAPTER IX,"not pierce through this symbolic husk, his writings were not intended."
2787,CHAPTER IX,Questions which cannot be fully answered without exposing the respondent
2788,CHAPTER IX,"to personal danger, are not entitled to a fair answer; and yet to say"
2789,CHAPTER IX,"this openly, would in many cases furnish the very advantage which the"
2790,CHAPTER IX,adversary is insidiously seeking after. Veracity does not consist
2791,CHAPTER IX,"in saying, but in the intention of communicating, truth; and the"
2792,CHAPTER IX,philosopher who cannot utter the whole truth without conveying
2793,CHAPTER IX,"falsehood, and at the same time, perhaps, exciting the most malignant"
2794,CHAPTER IX,"passions, is constrained to express himself either mythically or"
2795,CHAPTER IX,equivocally. When Kant therefore was importuned to settle the disputes
2796,CHAPTER IX,"of his commentators himself, by declaring what he meant, how could"
2797,CHAPTER IX,"he decline the honours of martyrdom with less offence, than by simply"
2798,CHAPTER IX,"replying, “I meant what I said, and at the age of near fourscore, I have"
2799,CHAPTER IX,"something else, and more important to do, than to write a commentary on"
2800,CHAPTER IX,my own works.”
2801,CHAPTER IX,
2802,CHAPTER IX,"Fichte’s Wissenschaftslehre, or Lore of Ultimate Science, was to add the"
2803,CHAPTER IX,"key-stone of the arch: and by commencing with an act, instead of a thing"
2804,CHAPTER IX,"or substance, Fichte assuredly gave the first mortal blow to Spinozism,"
2805,CHAPTER IX,as taught by Spinoza himself; and supplied the idea of a system truly
2806,CHAPTER IX,"metaphysical, and of a metaphysique truly systematic: (i.e. having"
2807,CHAPTER IX,its spring and principle within itself). But this fundamental idea he
2808,CHAPTER IX,"overbuilt with a heavy mass of mere notions, and psychological acts"
2809,CHAPTER IX,of arbitrary reflection. Thus his theory degenerated into a crude [30]
2810,CHAPTER IX,"egoismus, a boastful and hyperstoic hostility to Nature, as lifeless,"
2811,CHAPTER IX,"godless, and altogether unholy: while his religion consisted in the"
2812,CHAPTER IX,"assumption of a mere Ordo ordinans, which we were permitted exoterice"
2813,CHAPTER IX,"to call GOD; and his ethics in an ascetic, and almost monkish,"
2814,CHAPTER IX,mortification of the natural passions and desires. In Schelling’s
2815,CHAPTER IX,"Natur-Philosophie, and the System des transcendentalen Idealismus, I"
2816,CHAPTER IX,first found a genial coincidence with much that I had toiled out for
2817,CHAPTER IX,"myself, and a powerful assistance in what I had yet to do."
2818,CHAPTER IX,
2819,CHAPTER IX,"I have introduced this statement, as appropriate to the narrative"
2820,CHAPTER IX,nature of this sketch; yet rather in reference to the work which I have
2821,CHAPTER IX,"announced in a preceding page, than to my present subject. It would be"
2822,CHAPTER IX,"but a mere act of justice to myself, were I to warn my future readers,"
2823,CHAPTER IX,"than an identity of thought, or even similarity of phrase, will not be"
2824,CHAPTER IX,at all times a certain proof that the passage has been borrowed from
2825,CHAPTER IX,"Schelling, or that the conceptions were originally learnt from him. In"
2826,CHAPTER IX,"this instance, as in the dramatic lectures of Schlegel to which I have"
2827,CHAPTER IX,"before alluded, from the same motive of self-defence against the charge"
2828,CHAPTER IX,"of plagiarism, many of the most striking resemblances, indeed all the"
2829,CHAPTER IX,"main and fundamental ideas, were born and matured in my mind before"
2830,CHAPTER IX,I had ever seen a single page of the German Philosopher; and I might
2831,CHAPTER IX,"indeed affirm with truth, before the more important works of Schelling"
2832,CHAPTER IX,"had been written, or at least made public. Nor is this coincidence"
2833,CHAPTER IX,at all to be wondered at. We had studied in the same school; been
2834,CHAPTER IX,"disciplined by the same preparatory philosophy, namely, the writings"
2835,CHAPTER IX,of Kant; we had both equal obligations to the polar logic and dynamic
2836,CHAPTER IX,"philosophy of Giordano Bruno; and Schelling has lately, and, as of"
2837,CHAPTER IX,"recent acquisition, avowed that same affectionate reverence for the"
2838,CHAPTER IX,"labours of Behmen, and other mystics, which I had formed at a much"
2839,CHAPTER IX,earlier period. The coincidence of Schelling’s system with certain
2840,CHAPTER IX,"general ideas of Behmen, he declares to have been mere coincidence;"
2841,CHAPTER IX,while my obligations have been more direct. He needs give to Behmen only
2842,CHAPTER IX,feelings of sympathy; while I owe him a debt of gratitude. God forbid!
2843,CHAPTER IX,that I should be suspected of a wish to enter into a rivalry with
2844,CHAPTER IX,"Schelling for the honours so unequivocally his right, not only as a"
2845,CHAPTER IX,"great and original genius, but as the founder of the Philosophy of"
2846,CHAPTER IX,"Nature, and as the most successful improver of the Dynamic System [31]"
2847,CHAPTER IX,"which, begun by Bruno, was re-introduced (in a more philosophical form,"
2848,CHAPTER IX,and freed from all its impurities and visionary accompaniments) by Kant;
2849,CHAPTER IX,in whom it was the native and necessary growth of his own system. Kant’s
2850,CHAPTER IX,"followers, however, on whom (for the greater part) their master’s cloak"
2851,CHAPTER IX,"had fallen without, or with a very scanty portion of, his spirit, had"
2852,CHAPTER IX,"adopted his dynamic ideas, only as a more refined species of mechanics."
2853,CHAPTER IX,"With exception of one or two fundamental ideas, which cannot be withheld"
2854,CHAPTER IX,"from Fichte, to Schelling we owe the completion, and the most important"
2855,CHAPTER IX,"victories, of this revolution in philosophy. To me it will be happiness"
2856,CHAPTER IX,"and honour enough, should I succeed in rendering the system itself"
2857,CHAPTER IX,"intelligible to my countrymen, and in the application of it to the most"
2858,CHAPTER IX,awful of subjects for the most important of purposes. Whether a work
2859,CHAPTER IX,"is the offspring of a man’s own spirit, and the product of original"
2860,CHAPTER IX,"thinking, will be discovered by those who are its sole legitimate"
2861,CHAPTER IX,"judges, by better tests than the mere reference to dates. For readers in"
2862,CHAPTER IX,"general, let whatever shall be found in this or any future work of"
2863,CHAPTER IX,"mine, that resembles, or coincides with, the doctrines of my German"
2864,CHAPTER IX,"predecessor, though contemporary, be wholly attributed to him: provided,"
2865,CHAPTER IX,"that the absence of distinct references to his books, which I could"
2866,CHAPTER IX,not at all times make with truth as designating citations or thoughts
2867,CHAPTER IX,"actually derived from him; and which, I trust, would, after this general"
2868,CHAPTER IX,acknowledgment be superfluous; be not charged on me as an ungenerous
2869,CHAPTER IX,concealment or intentional plagiarism. I have not indeed (eheu! res
2870,CHAPTER IX,angusta domi!) been hitherto able to procure more than two of his
2871,CHAPTER IX,"books, viz. the first volume of his collected Tracts, and his System of"
2872,CHAPTER IX,"Transcendental Idealism; to which, however, I must add a small pamphlet"
2873,CHAPTER IX,"against Fichte, the spirit of which was to my feelings painfully"
2874,CHAPTER IX,"incongruous with the principles, and which (with the usual allowance"
2875,CHAPTER IX,afforded to an antithesis) displayed the love of wisdom rather than the
2876,CHAPTER IX,wisdom of love. I regard truth as a divine ventriloquist: I care not
2877,CHAPTER IX,"from whose mouth the sounds are supposed to proceed, if only the words"
2878,CHAPTER IX,"are audible and intelligible. “Albeit, I must confess to be half in"
2879,CHAPTER IX,"doubt, whether I should bring it forth or no, it being so contrary to"
2880,CHAPTER IX,"the eye of the world, and the world so potent in most men’s hearts, that"
2881,CHAPTER IX,I shall endanger either not to be regarded or not to be understood.”
2882,CHAPTER IX,
2883,CHAPTER IX,"And to conclude the subject of citation, with a cluster of citations,"
2884,CHAPTER IX,"which as taken from books, not in common use, may contribute to the"
2885,CHAPTER IX,"reader’s amusement, as a voluntary before a sermon: “Dolet mihi quidem"
2886,CHAPTER IX,"deliciis literarum inescatos subito jam homines adeo esse, praesertim"
2887,CHAPTER IX,"qui Christianos se profitentur, et legere nisi quod ad delectationem"
2888,CHAPTER IX,"facit, sustineant nihil: unde et discipline severiores et philosophia"
2889,CHAPTER IX,ipsa jam fere prorsus etiam a doctis negliguntur. Quod quidem propositum
2890,CHAPTER IX,"studiorum, nisi mature corrigitur, tam magnum rebus incommodum dabit,"
2891,CHAPTER IX,"quam dedit barbaries olim. Pertinax res barbaries est, fateor: sed minus"
2892,CHAPTER IX,"potent tamen, quam illa mollities et persuasa prudentia literarum,"
2893,CHAPTER IX,"si ratione caret, sapientiae virtutisque specie mortales misere"

2895,CHAPTER IX,rusticana seculi nostri ruditate captatrix illa communi-loquentia robur

2897,CHAPTER IX,
2898,CHAPTER IX,"A too prophetic remark, which has been in fulfilment from the year"
2899,CHAPTER IX,"1680, to the present 1815. By persuasa prudentia, Grynaeus means"

2901,CHAPTER IX,reason.

2947,CHAPTER X,"elsewhere.” Neither have, I. I constructed it myself from the Greek"
2948,CHAPTER X,"words, eis en plattein, to shape into one; because, having to convey a"
2949,CHAPTER X,"new sense, I thought that a new term would both aid the recollection of"
2950,CHAPTER X,"my meaning, and prevent its being confounded with the usual import of"
2951,CHAPTER X,"the word, imagination. “But this is pedantry!” Not necessarily so, I"
2952,CHAPTER X,"hope. If I am not misinformed, pedantry consists in the use of words"
2953,CHAPTER X,"unsuitable to the time, place, and company. The language of the market"
2954,CHAPTER X,"would be in the schools as pedantic, though it might not be reprobated"
2955,CHAPTER X,"by that name, as the language of the schools in the market. The mere"
2956,CHAPTER X,"man of the world, who insists that no other terms but such as occur in"
2957,CHAPTER X,"common conversation should be employed in a scientific disquisition, and"
2958,CHAPTER X,"with no greater precision, is as truly a pedant as the man of letters,"
2959,CHAPTER X,"who either over-rating the acquirements of his auditors, or misled by"
2960,CHAPTER X,"his own familiarity with technical or scholastic terms, converses at the"
2961,CHAPTER X,wine-table with his mind fixed on his museum or laboratory; even though
2962,CHAPTER X,the latter pedant instead of desiring his wife to make the tea should
2963,CHAPTER X,bid her add to the quant. suff. of thea Sinensis the oxyd of hydrogen
2964,CHAPTER X,saturated with caloric. To use the colloquial (and in truth somewhat
2965,CHAPTER X,"vulgar) metaphor, if the pedant of the cloister, and the pedant of the"
2966,CHAPTER X,"lobby, both smell equally of the shop, yet the odour from the Russian"
2967,CHAPTER X,binding of good old authentic-looking folios and quartos is less
2968,CHAPTER X,"annoying than the steams from the tavern or bagnio. Nay, though the"
2969,CHAPTER X,"pedantry of the scholar should betray a little ostentation, yet a"
2970,CHAPTER X,"well-conditioned mind would more easily, methinks, tolerate the fox"
2971,CHAPTER X,"brush of learned vanity, than the sans culotterie of a contemptuous"

2973,CHAPTER X,sneer at the pompous incumbrance of tails.
2974,CHAPTER X,
2975,CHAPTER X,The first lesson of philosophic discipline is to wean the student’s
2976,CHAPTER X,"attention from the degrees of things, which alone form the vocabulary of"
2977,CHAPTER X,"common life, and to direct it to the kind abstracted from degree. Thus"
2978,CHAPTER X,the chemical student is taught not to be startled at disquisitions on
2979,CHAPTER X,"the heat in ice, or on latent and fixible light. In such discourse the"
2980,CHAPTER X,instructor has no other alternative than either to use old words
2981,CHAPTER X,with new meanings (the plan adopted by Darwin in his Zoonomia;) or to
2982,CHAPTER X,"introduce new terms, after the example of Linnaeus, and the framers"
2983,CHAPTER X,of the present chemical nomenclature. The latter mode is evidently
2984,CHAPTER X,"preferable, were it only that the former demands a twofold exertion of"
2985,CHAPTER X,"thought in one and the same act. For the reader, or hearer, is required"
2986,CHAPTER X,"not only to learn and bear in mind the new definition; but to unlearn,"
2987,CHAPTER X,"and keep out of his view, the old and habitual meaning; a far more"
2988,CHAPTER X,"difficult and perplexing task, and for which the mere semblance of"
2989,CHAPTER X,"eschewing pedantry seems to me an inadequate compensation. Where,"
2990,CHAPTER X,"indeed, it is in our power to recall an unappropriate term that had"
2991,CHAPTER X,"without sufficient reason become obsolete, it is doubtless a less evil"
2992,CHAPTER X,to restore than to coin anew. Thus to express in one word all that
2993,CHAPTER X,"appertains to the perception, considered as passive and merely"
2994,CHAPTER X,"recipient, I have adopted from our elder classics the word sensuous;"
2995,CHAPTER X,"because sensual is not at present used, except in a bad sense, or at"
2996,CHAPTER X,least as a moral distinction; while sensitive and sensible would each
2997,CHAPTER X,"convey a different meaning. Thus too have I followed Hooker, Sanderson,"
2998,CHAPTER X,"Milton and others, in designating the immediateness of any act or"
2999,CHAPTER X,"object of knowledge by the word intuition, used sometimes subjectively,"
3000,CHAPTER X,"sometimes objectively, even as we use the word, thought; now as the"
3001,CHAPTER X,"thought, or act of thinking, and now as a thought, or the object of"
3002,CHAPTER X,our reflection; and we do this without confusion or obscurity. The very
3003,CHAPTER X,"words, objective and subjective, of such constant recurrence in the"
3004,CHAPTER X,"schools of yore, I have ventured to re-introduce, because I could not"
3005,CHAPTER X,so briefly or conveniently by any more familiar terms distinguish the
3006,CHAPTER X,"percipere from the percipi. Lastly, I have cautiously discriminated the"
3007,CHAPTER X,"terms, the reason, and the understanding, encouraged and confirmed"
3008,CHAPTER X,"by the authority of our genuine divines and philosophers, before the"
3009,CHAPTER X,Revolution.

3020,CHAPTER X,"of the necessity of the distinction, as both an indispensable condition"
3021,CHAPTER X,"and a vital part of all sound speculation in metaphysics, ethical or"
3022,CHAPTER X,theological. To establish this distinction was one main object of
3023,CHAPTER X,The Friend; if even in a biography of my own literary life I can with
3024,CHAPTER X,"propriety refer to a work, which was printed rather than published, or"
3025,CHAPTER X,"so published that it had been well for the unfortunate author, if it"
3026,CHAPTER X,had remained in manuscript. I have even at this time bitter cause for
3027,CHAPTER X,"remembering that, which a number of my subscribers have but a trifling"
3028,CHAPTER X,motive for forgetting. This effusion might have been spared; but I
3029,CHAPTER X,"would fain flatter myself, that the reader will be less austere than an"
3030,CHAPTER X,"oriental professor of the bastinado, who during an attempt to extort per"
3031,CHAPTER X,"argumentum baculinum a full confession from a culprit, interrupted his"
3032,CHAPTER X,"outcry of pain by reminding him, that it was “a mere digression!” “All"
3033,CHAPTER X,"this noise, Sir! is nothing to the point, and no sort of answer to my"
3034,CHAPTER X,"questions!” “Ah! but,” (replied the sufferer,) “it is the most pertinent"

3040,CHAPTER X,"should be preparing or intending a periodical work, I warn him, in the"
3041,CHAPTER X,"first place, against trusting in the number of names on his subscription"
3042,CHAPTER X,list. For he cannot be certain that the names were put down by
3043,CHAPTER X,"sufficient authority; or, should that be ascertained, it still remains"
3044,CHAPTER X,"to be known, whether they were not extorted by some over zealous"
3045,CHAPTER X,"friend’s importunity; whether the subscriber had not yielded his name,"
3046,CHAPTER X,"merely from want of courage to answer, no; and with the intention of"
3047,CHAPTER X,dropping the work as soon as possible. One gentleman procured me nearly
3048,CHAPTER X,"a hundred names for THE FRIEND, and not only took frequent opportunity"
3049,CHAPTER X,"to remind me of his success in his canvass, but laboured to impress my"
3050,CHAPTER X,"mind with the sense of the obligation, I was under to the subscribers;"
3051,CHAPTER X,"for, (as he very pertinently admonished me,) “fifty-two shillings a year"
3052,CHAPTER X,"was a large sum to be bestowed on one individual, where there were so"
3053,CHAPTER X,many objects of charity with strong claims to the assistance of the
3054,CHAPTER X,benevolent.” Of these hundred patrons ninety threw up the publication
3055,CHAPTER X,"before the fourth number, without any notice; though it was well known"
3056,CHAPTER X,"to them, that in consequence of the distance, and the slowness and"
3057,CHAPTER X,"irregularity of the conveyance, I was compelled to lay in a stock of"
3058,CHAPTER X,stamped paper for at least eight weeks beforehand; each sheet of which
3059,CHAPTER X,stood me in five pence previously to its arrival at my printer’s; though
3060,CHAPTER X,the subscription money was not to be received till the twenty-first week
3061,CHAPTER X,"after the commencement of the work; and lastly, though it was in nine"
3062,CHAPTER X,cases out of ten impracticable for me to receive the money for two or
3063,CHAPTER X,three numbers without paying an equal sum for the postage.
3064,CHAPTER X,
3065,CHAPTER X,"In confirmation of my first caveat, I will select one fact among many."
3066,CHAPTER X,"On my list of subscribers, among a considerable number of names equally"
3067,CHAPTER X,"flattering, was that of an Earl of Cork, with his address. He might as"
3068,CHAPTER X,"well have been an Earl of Bottle, for aught I knew of him, who had been"
3069,CHAPTER X,"content to reverence the peerage in abstracto, rather than in concretis."
3070,CHAPTER X,"Of course THE FRIEND was regularly sent as far, if I remember right, as"
3071,CHAPTER X,"the eighteenth number; that is, till a fortnight before the subscription"
3072,CHAPTER X,was to be paid. And lo! just at this time I received a letter from his
3073,CHAPTER X,"Lordship, reproving me in language far more lordly than courteous for my"
3074,CHAPTER X,"impudence in directing my pamphlets to him, who knew nothing of me or my"
3075,CHAPTER X,"work! Seventeen or eighteen numbers of which, however, his Lordship"
3076,CHAPTER X,"was pleased to retain, probably for the culinary or post-culinary"
3077,CHAPTER X,conveniences of his servants.
3078,CHAPTER X,
3079,CHAPTER X,"Secondly, I warn all others from the attempt to deviate from the"
3080,CHAPTER X,"ordinary mode of publishing a work by the trade. I thought indeed, that"
3081,CHAPTER X,"to the purchaser it was indifferent, whether thirty per cent of the"
3082,CHAPTER X,purchase-money went to the booksellers or to the government; and that
3083,CHAPTER X,the convenience of receiving the work by the post at his own door would
3084,CHAPTER X,"give the preference to the latter. It is hard, I own, to have been"
3085,CHAPTER X,"labouring for years, in collecting and arranging the materials; to have"
3086,CHAPTER X,spent every shilling that could be spared after the necessaries of life
3087,CHAPTER X,"had been furnished, in buying books, or in journeys for the purpose of"
3088,CHAPTER X,consulting them or of acquiring facts at the fountain head; then to buy
3089,CHAPTER X,"the paper, pay for the printing, and the like, all at least fifteen per"
3090,CHAPTER X,cent beyond what the trade would have paid; and then after all to give
3091,CHAPTER X,"thirty per cent not of the net profits, but of the gross results of the"
3092,CHAPTER X,"sale, to a man who has merely to give the books shelf or warehouse room,"
3093,CHAPTER X,and permit his apprentice to hand them over the counter to those who may
3094,CHAPTER X,"ask for them; and this too copy by copy, although, if the work be on any"
3095,CHAPTER X,"philosophical or scientific subject, it may be years before the edition"
3096,CHAPTER X,"is sold off. All this, I confess, must seem a hardship, and one, to"
3097,CHAPTER X,which the products of industry in no other mode of exertion are subject.
3098,CHAPTER X,"Yet even this is better, far better, than to attempt in any way to unite"
3099,CHAPTER X,the functions of author and publisher. But the most prudent mode is to
3100,CHAPTER X,"sell the copy-right, at least of one or more editions, for the most that"
3101,CHAPTER X,the trade will offer. By few only can a large remuneration be expected;
3102,CHAPTER X,but fifty pounds and ease of mind are of more real advantage to a
3103,CHAPTER X,"literary man, than the chance of five hundred with the certainty"
3104,CHAPTER X,of insult and degrading anxieties. I shall have been grievously
3105,CHAPTER X,"misunderstood, if this statement should be interpreted as written"
3106,CHAPTER X,with the desire of detracting from the character of booksellers or
3107,CHAPTER X,publishers. The individuals did not make the laws and customs of their
3108,CHAPTER X,"trade, but, as in every other trade, take them as they find them. Till"
3109,CHAPTER X,"the evil can be proved to be removable, and without the substitution of"
3110,CHAPTER X,"an equal or greater inconvenience, it were neither wise nor manly even"
3111,CHAPTER X,"to complain of it. But to use it as a pretext for speaking, or even for"
3112,CHAPTER X,"thinking, or feeling, unkindly or opprobriously of the tradesmen, as"
3113,CHAPTER X,"individuals, would be something worse than unwise or even than unmanly;"
3114,CHAPTER X,it would be immoral and calumnious. My motives point in a far different
3115,CHAPTER X,"direction and to far other objects, as will be seen in the conclusion of"
3116,CHAPTER X,the chapter.
3117,CHAPTER X,
3118,CHAPTER X,"A learned and exemplary old clergyman, who many years ago went to his"
3119,CHAPTER X,"reward followed by the regrets and blessings of his flock, published"
3120,CHAPTER X,"at his own expense two volumes octavo, entitled, A NEW THEORY OF"
3121,CHAPTER X,REDEMPTION. The work was most severely handled in THE MONTHLY or
3122,CHAPTER X,"CRITICAL REVIEW, I forget which; and this unprovoked hostility became"
3123,CHAPTER X,the good old man’s favourite topic of conversation among his friends.
3124,CHAPTER X,"“Well!” (he used to exclaim,) “in the second edition, I shall have an"
3125,CHAPTER X,opportunity of exposing both the ignorance and the malignity of the
3126,CHAPTER X,anonymous critic.” Two or three years however passed by without any
3127,CHAPTER X,"tidings from the bookseller, who had undertaken the printing and"
3128,CHAPTER X,"publication of the work, and who was perfectly at his ease, as the"
3129,CHAPTER X,author was known to be a man of large property. At length the accounts
3130,CHAPTER X,were written for; and in the course of a few weeks they were presented
3131,CHAPTER X,"by the rider for the house, in person. My old friend put on"
3132,CHAPTER X,"his spectacles, and holding the scroll with no very firm hand,"
3133,CHAPTER X,"began--“Paper, so much: O moderate enough--not at all beyond my"
3134,CHAPTER X,"expectation! Printing, so much: well! moderate enough! Stitching,"
3135,CHAPTER X,"covers, advertisements, carriage, and so forth, so much.”--Still"
3136,CHAPTER X,nothing amiss. Selleridge (for orthography is no necessary part of
3137,CHAPTER X,a bookseller’s literary acquirements) L3. 3s. “Bless me! only three
3138,CHAPTER X,"guineas for the what d’ye call it--the selleridge?” “No more, Sir!”"
3139,CHAPTER X,"replied the rider. “Nay, but that is too moderate!” rejoined my old"
3140,CHAPTER X,friend. “Only three guineas for selling a thousand copies of a work in
3141,CHAPTER X,two volumes?” “O Sir!” (cries the young traveller) “you have mistaken
3142,CHAPTER X,the word. There have been none of them sold; they have been sent
3143,CHAPTER X,"back from London long ago; and this L3. 3s. is for the cellaridge,"
3144,CHAPTER X,or warehouse-room in our book cellar.” The work was in consequence
3145,CHAPTER X,preferred from the ominous cellar of the publisher’s to the author’s
3146,CHAPTER X,"garret; and, on presenting a copy to an acquaintance, the old gentleman"
3147,CHAPTER X,used to tell the anecdote with great humour and still greater good
3148,CHAPTER X,nature.
3149,CHAPTER X,
3150,CHAPTER X,"With equal lack of worldly knowledge, I was a far more than equal"
3151,CHAPTER X,"sufferer for it, at the very outset of my authorship. Toward the close"
3152,CHAPTER X,"of the first year from the time, that in an inauspicious hour I left the"
3153,CHAPTER X,"friendly cloisters, and the happy grove of quiet, ever honoured Jesus"
3154,CHAPTER X,"College, Cambridge, I was persuaded by sundry philanthropists and"
3155,CHAPTER X,"Anti-polemists to set on foot a periodical work, entitled THE WATCHMAN,"
3156,CHAPTER X,"that, according to the general motto of the work, all might know the"
3157,CHAPTER X,"truth, and that the truth might make us free! In order to exempt it from"
3158,CHAPTER X,"the stamp-tax, and likewise to contribute as little as possible to the"
3159,CHAPTER X,"supposed guilt of a war against freedom, it was to be published on every"
3160,CHAPTER X,"eighth day, thirty-two pages, large octavo, closely printed, and price"
3161,CHAPTER X,"only four-pence. Accordingly with a flaming prospectus,--“Knowledge is"
3162,CHAPTER X,"Power,” “To cry the state of the political atmosphere,”--and so forth,"
3163,CHAPTER X,"I set off on a tour to the North, from Bristol to Sheffield, for the"
3164,CHAPTER X,"purpose of procuring customers, preaching by the way in most of"
3165,CHAPTER X,"the great towns, as an hireless volunteer, in a blue coat and white"
3166,CHAPTER X,"waistcoat, that not a rag of the woman of Babylon might be seen on me."
3167,CHAPTER X,"For I was at that time and long after, though a Trinitarian (that is"
3168,CHAPTER X,"ad normam Platonis) in philosophy, yet a zealous Unitarian in religion;"
3169,CHAPTER X,"more accurately, I was a Psilanthropist, one of those who believe our"
3170,CHAPTER X,"Lord to have been the real son of Joseph, and who lay the main stress on"
3171,CHAPTER X,the resurrection rather than on the crucifixion. O! never can I remember
3172,CHAPTER X,"those days with either shame or regret. For I was most sincere, most"
3173,CHAPTER X,disinterested. My opinions were indeed in many and most important points
3174,CHAPTER X,"erroneous; but my heart was single. Wealth, rank, life itself then"
3175,CHAPTER X,"seemed cheap to me, compared with the interests of what I believed to"
3176,CHAPTER X,"be the truth, and the will of my Maker. I cannot even accuse myself of"
3177,CHAPTER X,having been actuated by vanity; for in the expansion of my enthusiasm I
3178,CHAPTER X,did not think of myself at all.
3179,CHAPTER X,
3180,CHAPTER X,My campaign commenced at Birmingham; and my first attack was on a rigid
3181,CHAPTER X,"Calvinist, a tallow-chandler by trade. He was a tall dingy man, in whom"
3182,CHAPTER X,"length was so predominant over breadth, that he might almost have been"
3183,CHAPTER X,borrowed for a foundery poker. O that face! a face kat’ emphasin! I
3184,CHAPTER X,"have it before me at this moment. The lank, black, twine-like hair,"
3185,CHAPTER X,"pingui-nitescent, cut in a straight line along the black stubble of his"
3186,CHAPTER X,"thin gunpowder eye-brows, that looked like a scorched after-math from a"
3187,CHAPTER X,"last week’s shaving. His coat collar behind in perfect unison, both of"
3188,CHAPTER X,"colour and lustre, with the coarse yet glib cordage, which I suppose"
3189,CHAPTER X,"he called his hair, and which with a bend inward at the nape of the"
3190,CHAPTER X,"neck,--the only approach to flexure in his whole figure,--slunk in"
3191,CHAPTER X,"behind his waistcoat; while the countenance lank, dark, very hard, and"
3192,CHAPTER X,"with strong perpendicular furrows, gave me a dim notion of some one"
3193,CHAPTER X,"looking at me through a used gridiron, all soot, grease, and iron! But"
3194,CHAPTER X,"he was one of the thorough-bred, a true lover of liberty, and, as I was"
3195,CHAPTER X,"informed, had proved to the satisfaction of many, that Mr. Pitt was one"
3196,CHAPTER X,"of the horns of the second beast in THE REVELATIONS, that spake as a"
3197,CHAPTER X,"dragon. A person, to whom one of my letters of recommendation had been"
3198,CHAPTER X,"addressed, was my introducer. It was a new event in my life, my first"
3199,CHAPTER X,"stroke in the new business I had undertaken of an author, yea, and of"
3200,CHAPTER X,an author trading on his own account. My companion after some imperfect
3201,CHAPTER X,sentences and a multitude of hums and has abandoned the cause to his
3202,CHAPTER X,"client; and I commenced an harangue of half an hour to Phileleutheros,"
3203,CHAPTER X,"the tallow-chandler, varying my notes, through the whole gamut of"
3204,CHAPTER X,"eloquence, from the ratiocinative to the declamatory, and in the latter"
3205,CHAPTER X,"from the pathetic to the indignant. I argued, I described, I promised, I"
3206,CHAPTER X,prophesied; and beginning with the captivity of nations I ended with the
3207,CHAPTER X,"near approach of the millennium, finishing the whole with some of my own"
3208,CHAPTER X,verses describing that glorious state out of the Religious Musings:
3209,CHAPTER X,
3210,CHAPTER X,------Such delights
3211,CHAPTER X,"As float to earth, permitted visitants!"
3212,CHAPTER X,When in some hour of solemn jubilee
3213,CHAPTER X,The massive gates of Paradise are thrown
3214,CHAPTER X,"Wide open, and forth come in fragments wild"
3215,CHAPTER X,"Sweet echoes of unearthly melodies,"
3216,CHAPTER X,"And odours snatched from beds of amaranth,"
3217,CHAPTER X,"And they, that from the crystal river of life"
3218,CHAPTER X,"Spring up on freshened wing, ambrosial gales!"
3219,CHAPTER X,
3220,CHAPTER X,My taper man of lights listened with perseverant and praiseworthy
3221,CHAPTER X,"patience, though, as I was afterwards told, on complaining of certain"
3222,CHAPTER X,"gales that were not altogether ambrosial, it was a melting day with"
3223,CHAPTER X,"him. “And what, Sir,” he said, after a short pause, “might the cost be?”"
3224,CHAPTER X,"“Only four-pence,”--(O! how I felt the anti-climax, the abysmal"
3225,CHAPTER X,"bathos of that four-pence!)--“only four-pence, Sir, each number, to be"
3226,CHAPTER X,published on every eighth day.”--“That comes to a deal of money at
3227,CHAPTER X,"the end of a year. And how much, did you say, there was to be for"
3228,CHAPTER X,"the money?”--“Thirty-two pages, Sir, large octavo, closely"
3229,CHAPTER X,printed.”--“Thirty and two pages? Bless me! why except what I does in a
3230,CHAPTER X,"family way on the Sabbath, that’s more than I ever reads, Sir! all"
3231,CHAPTER X,"the year round. I am as great a one, as any man in Brummagem, Sir!"
3232,CHAPTER X,"for liberty and truth and all them sort of things, but as to this,--no"
3233,CHAPTER X,"offence, I hope, Sir,--I must beg to be excused.”"
3234,CHAPTER X,
3235,CHAPTER X,"So ended my first canvass: from causes that I shall presently mention, I"
3236,CHAPTER X,made but one other application in person. This took place at Manchester
3237,CHAPTER X,to a stately and opulent wholesale dealer in cottons. He took my letter
3238,CHAPTER X,"of introduction, and, having perused it, measured me from head to foot"
3239,CHAPTER X,"and again from foot to head, and then asked if I had any bill or invoice"
3240,CHAPTER X,of the thing. I presented my prospectus to him. He rapidly skimmed
3241,CHAPTER X,"and hummed over the first side, and still more rapidly the second and"
3242,CHAPTER X,concluding page; crushed it within his fingers and the palm of his hand;
3243,CHAPTER X,then most deliberately and significantly rubbed and smoothed one part
3244,CHAPTER X,against the other; and lastly putting it into his pocket turned his back
3245,CHAPTER X,on me with an “over-run with these articles!” and so without another
3246,CHAPTER X,"syllable retired into his counting house. And, I can truly say, to my"
3247,CHAPTER X,unspeakable amusement.
3248,CHAPTER X,
3249,CHAPTER X,"This, I have said, was my second and last attempt. On returning baffled"
3250,CHAPTER X,"from the first, in which I had vainly essayed to repeat the miracle of"
3251,CHAPTER X,"Orpheus with the Brummagem patriot, I dined with the tradesman who had"
3252,CHAPTER X,introduced me to him. After dinner he importuned me to smoke a pipe with
3253,CHAPTER X,"him, and two or three other illuminati of the same rank. I objected,"
3254,CHAPTER X,both because I was engaged to spend the evening with a minister and
3255,CHAPTER X,"his friends, and because I had never smoked except once or twice in"
3256,CHAPTER X,"my lifetime, and then it was herb tobacco mixed with Oronooko. On the"
3257,CHAPTER X,"assurance, however, that the tobacco was equally mild, and seeing"
3258,CHAPTER X,too that it was of a yellow colour; not forgetting the lamentable
3259,CHAPTER X,"difficulty, I have always experienced, in saying, “No,” and in"
3260,CHAPTER X,"abstaining from what the people about me were doing,--I took half a"
3261,CHAPTER X,"pipe, filling the lower half of the bowl with salt. I was soon however"
3262,CHAPTER X,"compelled to resign it, in consequence of a giddiness and distressful"
3263,CHAPTER X,"feeling in my eyes, which, as I had drunk but a single glass of ale,"
3264,CHAPTER X,"must, I knew, have been the effect of the tobacco. Soon after, deeming"
3265,CHAPTER X,"myself recovered, I sallied forth to my engagement; but the walk and the"
3266,CHAPTER X,"fresh air brought on all the symptoms again, and, I had scarcely entered"
3267,CHAPTER X,"the minister’s drawing-room, and opened a small pacquet of letters,"
3268,CHAPTER X,which he had received from Bristol for me; ere I sank back on the sofa
3269,CHAPTER X,in a sort of swoon rather than sleep. Fortunately I had found just time
3270,CHAPTER X,"enough to inform him of the confused state of my feelings, and of"
3271,CHAPTER X,"the occasion. For here and thus I lay, my face like a wall that is"
3272,CHAPTER X,"white-washing, deathly pale and with the cold drops of perspiration"
3273,CHAPTER X,"running down it from my forehead, while one after another there dropped"
3274,CHAPTER X,"in the different gentlemen, who had been invited to meet, and spend the"
3275,CHAPTER X,"evening with me, to the number of from fifteen to twenty. As the"
3276,CHAPTER X,"poison of tobacco acts but for a short time, I at length awoke from"
3277,CHAPTER X,"insensibility, and looked round on the party, my eyes dazzled by the"
3278,CHAPTER X,candles which had been lighted in the interim. By way of relieving my
3279,CHAPTER X,"embarrassment one of the gentlemen began the conversation, with “Have"
3280,CHAPTER X,"you seen a paper to-day, Mr. Coleridge?” “Sir!” I replied, rubbing my"
3281,CHAPTER X,"eyes, “I am far from convinced, that a Christian is permitted to read"
3282,CHAPTER X,either newspapers or any other works of merely political and temporary
3283,CHAPTER X,"interest.” This remark, so ludicrously inapposite to, or rather,"
3284,CHAPTER X,"incongruous with, the purpose, for which I was known to have visited"
3285,CHAPTER X,"Birmingham, and to assist me in which they were all then met, produced"
3286,CHAPTER X,an involuntary and general burst of laughter; and seldom indeed have
3287,CHAPTER X,"I passed so many delightful hours, as I enjoyed in that room from"
3288,CHAPTER X,the moment of that laugh till an early hour the next morning.
3289,CHAPTER X,"Never, perhaps, in so mixed and numerous a party have I since heard"
3290,CHAPTER X,"conversation, sustained with such animation, enriched with such variety"
3291,CHAPTER X,of information and enlivened with such a flow of anecdote. Both then
3292,CHAPTER X,and afterwards they all joined in dissuading me from proceeding with
3293,CHAPTER X,my scheme; assured me in the most friendly and yet most flattering
3294,CHAPTER X,"expressions, that neither was the employment fit for me, nor I fit for"
3295,CHAPTER X,"the employment. Yet, if I determined on persevering in it, they promised"
3296,CHAPTER X,"to exert themselves to the utmost to procure subscribers, and insisted"
3297,CHAPTER X,"that I should make no more applications in person, but carry on the"
3298,CHAPTER X,"canvass by proxy. The same hospitable reception, the same dissuasion,"
3299,CHAPTER X,"and, that failing, the same kind exertions in my behalf, I met with at"
3300,CHAPTER X,"Manchester, Derby, Nottingham, Sheffield,--indeed, at every place in"
3301,CHAPTER X,which I took up my sojourn. I often recall with affectionate pleasure
3302,CHAPTER X,"the many respectable men who interested themselves for me, a perfect"
3303,CHAPTER X,"stranger to them, not a few of whom I can still name among my friends."
3304,CHAPTER X,They will bear witness for me how opposite even then my principles were
3305,CHAPTER X,"to those of Jacobinism or even of democracy, and can attest the strict"
3306,CHAPTER X,accuracy of the statement which I have left on record in the tenth and
3307,CHAPTER X,eleventh numbers of THE FRIEND.
3308,CHAPTER X,
3309,CHAPTER X,From this rememberable tour I returned with nearly a thousand names on
3310,CHAPTER X,"the subscription list of THE WATCHMAN; yet more than half convinced,"
3311,CHAPTER X,that prudence dictated the abandonment of the scheme. But for this
3312,CHAPTER X,very reason I persevered in it; for I was at that period of my life
3313,CHAPTER X,so completely hag-ridden by the fear of being influenced by selfish
3314,CHAPTER X,"motives, that to know a mode of conduct to be the dictate of prudence"
3315,CHAPTER X,"was a sort of presumptive proof to my feelings, that the contrary"
3316,CHAPTER X,"was the dictate of duty. Accordingly, I commenced the work, which was"
3317,CHAPTER X,announced in London by long bills in letters larger than had ever been
3318,CHAPTER X,"seen before, and which, I have been informed, for I did not see them"
3319,CHAPTER X,"myself, eclipsed the glories even of the lottery puffs. But alas!"
3320,CHAPTER X,the publication of the very first number was delayed beyond the day
3321,CHAPTER X,announced for its appearance. In the second number an essay against fast
3322,CHAPTER X,"days, with a most censurable application of a text from Isaiah for its"
3323,CHAPTER X,"motto, lost me near five hundred of my subscribers at one blow. In the"
3324,CHAPTER X,two following numbers I made enemies of all my Jacobin and democratic
3325,CHAPTER X,"patrons; for, disgusted by their infidelity, and their adoption of"
3326,CHAPTER X,"French morals with French psilosophy; and perhaps thinking, that charity"
3327,CHAPTER X,ought to begin nearest home; Instead of abusing the government and the
3328,CHAPTER X,"Aristocrats chiefly or entirely, as had been expected of me, I levelled"
3329,CHAPTER X,"my attacks at “modern patriotism,” and even ventured to declare my"
3330,CHAPTER X,"belief, that whatever the motives of ministers might have been for the"
3331,CHAPTER X,"sedition, or as it was then the fashion to call them, the gagging bills,"
3332,CHAPTER X,yet the bills themselves would produce an effect to be desired by all
3333,CHAPTER X,"the true friends of freedom, as far as they should contribute to deter"
3334,CHAPTER X,"men from openly declaiming on subjects, the principles of which they had"
3335,CHAPTER X,"never bottomed and from “pleading to the poor and ignorant, instead"
3336,CHAPTER X,"of pleading for them.” At the same time I avowed my conviction, that"
3337,CHAPTER X,national education and a concurring spread of the Gospel were the
3338,CHAPTER X,indispensable condition of any true political melioration. Thus by the
3339,CHAPTER X,"time the seventh number was published, I had the mortification--(but why"
3340,CHAPTER X,"should I say this, when in truth I cared too little for any thing that"
3341,CHAPTER X,concerned my worldly interests to be at all mortified about it?)--of
3342,CHAPTER X,seeing the preceding numbers exposed in sundry old iron shops for a
3343,CHAPTER X,penny a piece. At the ninth number I dropt the work. But from the London
3344,CHAPTER X,publisher I could not obtain a shilling; he was a ------ and set me at
3345,CHAPTER X,"defiance. From other places I procured but little, and after such delays"
3346,CHAPTER X,as rendered that little worth nothing; and I should have been inevitably
3347,CHAPTER X,"thrown into jail by my Bristol printer, who refused to wait even for a"
3348,CHAPTER X,"month, for a sum between eighty and ninety pounds, if the money had"
3349,CHAPTER X,"not been paid for me by a man by no means affluent, a dear friend,"
3350,CHAPTER X,"who attached himself to me from my first arrival at Bristol, who has"
3351,CHAPTER X,continued my friend with a fidelity unconquered by time or even by my
3352,CHAPTER X,own apparent neglect; a friend from whom I never received an advice that
3353,CHAPTER X,"was not wise, nor a remonstrance that was not gentle and affectionate."
3354,CHAPTER X,
3355,CHAPTER X,"Conscientiously an opponent of the first revolutionary war, yet with"
3356,CHAPTER X,my eyes thoroughly opened to the true character and impotence of the
3357,CHAPTER X,"favourers of revolutionary principles in England, principles which"
3358,CHAPTER X,"I held in abhorrence,--(for it was part of my political creed, that"
3359,CHAPTER X,whoever ceased to act as an individual by making himself a member of
3360,CHAPTER X,"any society not sanctioned by his Government, forfeited the rights of"
3361,CHAPTER X,"a citizen)--a vehement Anti-Ministerialist, but after the invasion of"
3362,CHAPTER X,"Switzerland, a more vehement Anti-Gallican, and still more intensely"
3363,CHAPTER X,"an Anti-Jacobin, I retired to a cottage at Stowey, and provided for my"
3364,CHAPTER X,scanty maintenance by writing verses for a London Morning Paper. I saw
3365,CHAPTER X,"plainly, that literature was not a profession, by which I could expect"
3366,CHAPTER X,"to live; for I could not disguise from myself, that, whatever my talents"
3367,CHAPTER X,"might or might not be in other respects, yet they were not of the sort"
3368,CHAPTER X,that could enable me to become a popular writer; and that whatever my
3369,CHAPTER X,"opinions might be in themselves, they were almost equi-distant from"
3370,CHAPTER X,"all the three prominent parties, the Pittites, the Foxites, and the"
3371,CHAPTER X,Democrats. Of the unsaleable nature of my writings I had an amusing
3372,CHAPTER X,memento one morning from our own servant girl. For happening to rise
3373,CHAPTER X,"at an earlier hour than usual, I observed her putting an extravagant"
3374,CHAPTER X,"quantity of paper into the grate in order to light the fire, and mildly"
3375,CHAPTER X,"checked her for her wastefulness; “La, Sir!” (replied poor Nanny) “why,"
3376,CHAPTER X,it is only Watchmen.”
3377,CHAPTER X,
3378,CHAPTER X,I now devoted myself to poetry and to the study of ethics and
3379,CHAPTER X,psychology; and so profound was my admiration at this time of Hartley’s
3380,CHAPTER X,"ESSAY ON MAN, that I gave his name to my first-born. In addition to the"
3381,CHAPTER X,"gentleman, my neighbour, whose garden joined on to my little orchard,"
3382,CHAPTER X,and the cultivation of whose friendship had been my sole motive in
3383,CHAPTER X,"choosing Stowey for my residence, I was so fortunate as to acquire,"
3384,CHAPTER X,"shortly after my settlement there, an invaluable blessing in the society"
3385,CHAPTER X,"and neighbourhood of one, to whom I could look up with equal reverence,"
3386,CHAPTER X,"whether I regarded him as a poet, a philosopher, or a man. His"
3387,CHAPTER X,"conversation extended to almost all subjects, except physics and"
3388,CHAPTER X,politics; with the latter he never troubled himself. Yet neither my
3389,CHAPTER X,retirement nor my utter abstraction from all the disputes of the day
3390,CHAPTER X,"could secure me in those jealous times from suspicion and obloquy, which"
3391,CHAPTER X,"did not stop at me, but extended to my excellent friend, whose perfect"
3392,CHAPTER X,innocence was even adduced as a proof of his guilt. One of the many busy
3393,CHAPTER X,"sycophants of that day,--(I here use the word sycophant in its original"
3394,CHAPTER X,"sense, as a wretch who flatters the prevailing party by informing"
3395,CHAPTER X,"against his neighbours, under pretence that they are exporters of"
3396,CHAPTER X,"prohibited figs or fancies,--for the moral application of the term it"
3397,CHAPTER X,"matters not which)--one of these sycophantic law-mongrels, discoursing"
3398,CHAPTER X,"on the politics of the neighbourhood, uttered the following deep"
3399,CHAPTER X,"remark: “As to Coleridge, there is not so much harm in him, for he is a"
3400,CHAPTER X,whirl-brain that talks whatever comes uppermost; but that ------! he is
3401,CHAPTER X,the dark traitor. You never hear HIM say a syllable on the subject.”
3402,CHAPTER X,
3403,CHAPTER X,Now that the hand of Providence has disciplined all Europe into
3404,CHAPTER X,"sobriety, as men tame wild elephants, by alternate blows and caresses;"
3405,CHAPTER X,now that Englishmen of all classes are restored to their old English
3406,CHAPTER X,"notions and feelings; it will with difficulty be credited, how great an"
3407,CHAPTER X,influence was at that time possessed and exerted by the spirit of secret
3408,CHAPTER X,"defamation,--(the too constant attendant on party-zeal)--during"
3409,CHAPTER X,the restless interim from 1793 to the commencement of the Addington
3410,CHAPTER X,"administration, or the year before the truce of Amiens. For by the"
3411,CHAPTER X,"latter period the minds of the partizans, exhausted by excess of"
3412,CHAPTER X,"stimulation and humbled by mutual disappointment, had become languid."
3413,CHAPTER X,"The same causes, that inclined the nation to peace, disposed the"
3414,CHAPTER X,individuals to reconciliation. Both parties had found themselves in
3415,CHAPTER X,the wrong. The one had confessedly mistaken the moral character of
3416,CHAPTER X,"the revolution, and the other had miscalculated both its moral and"
3417,CHAPTER X,"its physical resources. The experiment was made at the price of great,"
3418,CHAPTER X,"almost, we may say, of humiliating sacrifices; and wise men foresaw that"
3419,CHAPTER X,"it would fail, at least in its direct and ostensible object. Yet it"
3420,CHAPTER X,"was purchased cheaply, and realized an object of equal value, and,"
3421,CHAPTER X,"if possible, of still more vital importance. For it brought about"
3422,CHAPTER X,a national unanimity unexampled in our history since the reign of
3423,CHAPTER X,"Elizabeth; and Providence, never wanting to a good work when men have"
3424,CHAPTER X,"done their parts, soon provided a common focus in the cause of Spain,"
3425,CHAPTER X,which made us all once more Englishmen by at once gratifying and
3426,CHAPTER X,correcting the predilections of both parties. The sincere reverers of
3427,CHAPTER X,the throne felt the cause of loyalty ennobled by its alliance with that
3428,CHAPTER X,"of freedom; while the honest zealots of the people could not but admit,"
3429,CHAPTER X,"that freedom itself assumed a more winning form, humanized by loyalty"
3430,CHAPTER X,"and consecrated by religious principle. The youthful enthusiasts who,"
3431,CHAPTER X,"flattered by the morning rainbow of the French revolution, had made a"
3432,CHAPTER X,"boast of expatriating their hopes and fears, now, disciplined by the"
3433,CHAPTER X,"succeeding storms and sobered by increase of years, had been taught"
3434,CHAPTER X,to prize and honour the spirit of nationality as the best safeguard of
3435,CHAPTER X,"national independence, and this again as the absolute pre-requisite and"
3436,CHAPTER X,necessary basis of popular rights.
3437,CHAPTER X,
3438,CHAPTER X,"If in Spain too disappointment has nipped our too forward expectations,"
3439,CHAPTER X,yet all is not destroyed that is checked. The crop was perhaps springing
3440,CHAPTER X,"up too rank in the stalk to kern well; and there were, doubtless,"
3441,CHAPTER X,symptoms of the Gallican blight on it. If superstition and despotism
3442,CHAPTER X,have been suffered to let in their wolvish sheep to trample and eat it
3443,CHAPTER X,"down even to the surface, yet the roots remain alive, and the"
3444,CHAPTER X,second growth may prove the stronger and healthier for the temporary
3445,CHAPTER X,"interruption. At all events, to us heaven has been just and gracious."
3446,CHAPTER X,"The people of England did their best, and have received their rewards."
3447,CHAPTER X,"Long may we continue to deserve it! Causes, which it had been too"
3448,CHAPTER X,generally the habit of former statesmen to regard as belonging to
3449,CHAPTER X,"another world, are now admitted by all ranks to have been the main"
3450,CHAPTER X,agents of our success. “We fought from heaven; the stars in their
3451,CHAPTER X,courses fought against Sisera.” If then unanimity grounded on moral
3452,CHAPTER X,feelings has been among the least equivocal sources of our national
3453,CHAPTER X,"glory, that man deserves the esteem of his countrymen, even as patriots,"
3454,CHAPTER X,who devotes his life and the utmost efforts of his intellect to the
3455,CHAPTER X,preservation and continuance of that unanimity by the disclosure
3456,CHAPTER X,and establishment of principles. For by these all opinions must be
3457,CHAPTER X,"ultimately tried; and, (as the feelings of men are worthy of regard only"
3458,CHAPTER X,"as far as they are the representatives of their fixed opinions,) on the"
3459,CHAPTER X,"knowledge of these all unanimity, not accidental and fleeting, must be"
3460,CHAPTER X,"grounded. Let the scholar, who doubts this assertion, refer only to"
3461,CHAPTER X,the speeches and writings of Edmund Burke at the commencement of the
3462,CHAPTER X,American war and compare them with his speeches and writings at the
3463,CHAPTER X,commencement of the French revolution. He will find the principles
3464,CHAPTER X,exactly the same and the deductions the same; but the practical
3465,CHAPTER X,inferences almost opposite in the one case from those drawn in the
3466,CHAPTER X,other; yet in both equally legitimate and in both equally confirmed by
3467,CHAPTER X,the results. Whence gained he the superiority of foresight? Whence arose
3468,CHAPTER X,"the striking difference, and in most instances even, the discrepancy"
3469,CHAPTER X,"between the grounds assigned by him and by those who voted with him, on"
3470,CHAPTER X,"the same questions? How are we to explain the notorious fact, that"
3471,CHAPTER X,the speeches and writings of Edmund Burke are more interesting at the
3472,CHAPTER X,present day than they were found at the time of their first publication;
3473,CHAPTER X,"while those of his illustrious confederates are either forgotten, or"
3474,CHAPTER X,"exist only to furnish proofs, that the same conclusion, which one man"
3475,CHAPTER X,"had deduced scientifically, may be brought out by another in consequence"
3476,CHAPTER X,of errors that luckily chanced to neutralize each other. It would be
3477,CHAPTER X,"unhandsome as a conjecture, even were it not, as it actually is, false"
3478,CHAPTER X,in point of fact to attribute this difference to the deficiency
3479,CHAPTER X,"of talent on the part of Burke’s friends, or of experience, or of"
3480,CHAPTER X,"historical knowledge. The satisfactory solution is, that Edmund Burke"
3481,CHAPTER X,"possessed and had sedulously sharpened that eye, which sees all things,"
3482,CHAPTER X,"actions, and events, in relation to the laws that determine their"
3483,CHAPTER X,existence and circumscribe their possibility. He referred habitually
3484,CHAPTER X,to principles. He was a scientific statesman; and therefore a seer. For
3485,CHAPTER X,"every principle contains in itself the germs of a prophecy; and, as the"
3486,CHAPTER X,"prophetic power is the essential privilege of science, so the fulfilment"
3487,CHAPTER X,"of its oracles supplies the outward and, (to men in general,) the"
3488,CHAPTER X,only test of its claim to the title. Wearisome as Burke’s refinements
3489,CHAPTER X,"appeared to his parliamentary auditors, yet the cultivated classes"
3490,CHAPTER X,"throughout Europe have reason to be thankful, that he"
3491,CHAPTER X,
3492,CHAPTER X,"------went on refining,"
3493,CHAPTER X,"And thought of convincing, while they thought of dining."
3494,CHAPTER X,
3495,CHAPTER X,"Our very sign-boards, (said an illustrious friend to me,) give evidence,"
3496,CHAPTER X,"that there has been a Titian in the world. In like manner, not only the"
3497,CHAPTER X,"debates in parliament, not only our proclamations and state papers,"
3498,CHAPTER X,but the essays and leading paragraphs of our journals are so many
3499,CHAPTER X,remembrancers of Edmund Burke. Of this the reader may easily convince
3500,CHAPTER X,"himself, if either by recollection or reference he will compare the"
3501,CHAPTER X,opposition newspapers at the commencement and during the five or six
3502,CHAPTER X,"following years of the French revolution with the sentiments, and"
3503,CHAPTER X,"grounds of argument assumed in the same class of journals at present,"
3504,CHAPTER X,and for some years past.
3505,CHAPTER X,
3506,CHAPTER X,"Whether the spirit of jacobinism, which the writings of Burke exorcised"
3507,CHAPTER X,"from the higher and from the literary classes, may not, like the ghost"
3508,CHAPTER X,"in Hamlet, be heard moving and mining in the underground chambers"
3509,CHAPTER X,"with an activity the more dangerous because less noisy, may admit of"
3510,CHAPTER X,"a question. I have given my opinions on this point, and the grounds of"
3511,CHAPTER X,"them, in my letters to judge Fletcher occasioned by his charge to the"
3512,CHAPTER X,"Wexford grand jury, and published in the Courier. Be this as it may, the"
3513,CHAPTER X,"evil spirit of jealousy, and with it the Cerberean whelps of feud and"
3514,CHAPTER X,"slander, no longer walk their rounds, in cultivated society."
3515,CHAPTER X,
3516,CHAPTER X,Far different were the days to which these anecdotes have carried me
3517,CHAPTER X,back. The dark guesses of some zealous Quidnunc met with so congenial a
3518,CHAPTER X,"soil in the grave alarm of a titled Dogberry of our neighbourhood, that"
3519,CHAPTER X,a spy was actually sent down from the government pour surveillance of
3520,CHAPTER X,"myself and friend. There must have been not only abundance, but variety"
3521,CHAPTER X,of these “honourable men” at the disposal of Ministers: for this proved
3522,CHAPTER X,a very honest fellow. After three weeks’ truly Indian perseverance in
3523,CHAPTER X,"tracking us, (for we were commonly together,) during all which"
3524,CHAPTER X,"time seldom were we out of doors, but he contrived to be within"
3525,CHAPTER X,"hearing,--(and all the while utterly unsuspected; how indeed could such"
3526,CHAPTER X,a suspicion enter our fancies?)--he not only rejected Sir Dogberry’s
3527,CHAPTER X,"request that he would try yet a little longer, but declared to him his"
3528,CHAPTER X,"belief, that both my friend and myself were as good subjects, for aught"
3529,CHAPTER X,"he could discover to the contrary, as any in His Majesty’s dominions. He"
3530,CHAPTER X,"had repeatedly hid himself, he said, for hours together behind a bank at"
3531,CHAPTER X,"the sea-side, (our favourite seat,) and overheard our conversation. At"
3532,CHAPTER X,"first he fancied, that we were aware of our danger; for he often heard"
3533,CHAPTER X,"me talk of one Spy Nozy, which he was inclined to interpret of himself,"
3534,CHAPTER X,and of a remarkable feature belonging to him; but he was speedily
3535,CHAPTER X,convinced that it was the name of a man who had made a book and lived
3536,CHAPTER X,"long ago. Our talk ran most upon books, and we were perpetually desiring"
3537,CHAPTER X,"each other to look at this, and to listen to that; but he could not"
3538,CHAPTER X,catch a word about politics. Once he had joined me on the road; (this
3539,CHAPTER X,"occurred, as I was returning home alone from my friend’s house, which"
3540,CHAPTER X,"was about three miles from my own cottage,) and, passing himself off"
3541,CHAPTER X,"as a traveller, he had entered into conversation with me, and talked"
3542,CHAPTER X,"of purpose in a democrat way in order to draw me out. The result, it"
3543,CHAPTER X,"appears, not only convinced him that I was no friend of jacobinism; but,"
3544,CHAPTER X,"(he added,) I had “plainly made it out to be such a silly as well as"
3545,CHAPTER X,"wicked thing, that he felt ashamed though he had only put it on.” I"
3546,CHAPTER X,"distinctly remembered the occurrence, and had mentioned it immediately"
3547,CHAPTER X,"on my return, repeating what the traveller with his Bardolph nose had"
3548,CHAPTER X,"said, with my own answer; and so little did I suspect the true object"
3549,CHAPTER X,"of my “tempter ere accuser,” that I expressed with no small pleasure my"
3550,CHAPTER X,"hope and belief, that the conversation had been of some service to the"
3551,CHAPTER X,poor misled malcontent. This incident therefore prevented all doubt as
3552,CHAPTER X,"to the truth of the report, which through a friendly medium came to me"
3553,CHAPTER X,"from the master of the village inn, who had been ordered to entertain"
3554,CHAPTER X,"the Government gentleman in his best manner, but above all to be silent"
3555,CHAPTER X,concerning such a person being in his house. At length he received Sir
3556,CHAPTER X,Dogberry’s commands to accompany his guest at the final interview;
3557,CHAPTER X,"and, after the absolving suffrage of the gentleman honoured with the"
3558,CHAPTER X,"confidence of Ministers, answered, as follows, to the following queries:"
3559,CHAPTER X,"D. “Well, landlord! and what do you know of the person in question? L."
3560,CHAPTER X,"I see him often pass by with maister ----, my landlord, (that is, the"
3561,CHAPTER X,"owner of the house,) and sometimes with the new-comers at Holford; but"
3562,CHAPTER X,"I never said a word to him or he to me. D. But do you not know, that he"
3563,CHAPTER X,has distributed papers and hand-bills of a seditious nature among the
3564,CHAPTER X,"common people? L. No, your Honour! I never heard of such a thing. D."
3565,CHAPTER X,"Have you not seen this Mr. Coleridge, or heard of, his haranguing and"
3566,CHAPTER X,talking to knots and clusters of the inhabitants?--What are you grinning
3567,CHAPTER X,"at, Sir? L. Beg your Honour’s pardon! but I was only thinking, how"
3568,CHAPTER X,"they’d have stared at him. If what I have heard be true, your Honour!"
3569,CHAPTER X,"they would not have understood a word he said. When our Vicar was here,"
3570,CHAPTER X,"Dr. L. the master of the great school and Canon of Windsor, there was a"
3571,CHAPTER X,"great dinner party at maister’s; and one of the farmers, that was there,"
3572,CHAPTER X,told us that he and the Doctor talked real Hebrew Greek at each other
3573,CHAPTER X,"for an hour together after dinner. D. Answer the question, Sir! does he"
3574,CHAPTER X,ever harangue the people? L. I hope your Honour an’t angry with me. I
3575,CHAPTER X,"can say no more than I know. I never saw him talking with any one, but"
3576,CHAPTER X,"my landlord, and our curate, and the strange gentleman. D. Has he not"
3577,CHAPTER X,"been seen wandering on the hills towards the Channel, and along the"
3578,CHAPTER X,"shore, with books and papers in his hand, taking charts and maps of"
3579,CHAPTER X,"the country? L. Why, as to that, your Honour! I own, I have heard; I am"
3580,CHAPTER X,"sure, I would not wish to say ill of any body; but it is certain, that I"
3581,CHAPTER X,"have heard--D. Speak out, man! don’t be afraid, you are doing your duty"
3582,CHAPTER X,"to your King and Government. What have you heard? L. Why, folks do"
3583,CHAPTER X,"say, your Honour! as how that he is a Poet, and that he is going to put"
3584,CHAPTER X,"Quantock and all about here in print; and as they be so much together,"
3585,CHAPTER X,I suppose that the strange gentleman has some consarn in the
3586,CHAPTER X,"business.”--So ended this formidable inquisition, the latter part of"
3587,CHAPTER X,"which alone requires explanation, and at the same time entitles the"
3588,CHAPTER X,anecdote to a place in my literary life. I had considered it as a defect
3589,CHAPTER X,"in the admirable poem of THE TASK, that the subject, which gives the"
3590,CHAPTER X,"title to the work, was not, and indeed could not be, carried on beyond"
3591,CHAPTER X,"the three or four first pages, and that, throughout the poem, the"
3592,CHAPTER X,"connections are frequently awkward, and the transitions abrupt and"
3593,CHAPTER X,"arbitrary. I sought for a subject, that should give equal room and"
3594,CHAPTER X,"freedom for description, incident, and impassioned reflections on men,"
3595,CHAPTER X,"nature, and society, yet supply in itself a natural connection to the"
3596,CHAPTER X,"parts, and unity to the whole. Such a subject I conceived myself to"
3597,CHAPTER X,"have found in a stream, traced from its source in the hills among the"
3598,CHAPTER X,"yellow-red moss and conical glass-shaped tufts of bent, to the first"
3599,CHAPTER X,"break or fall, where its drops become audible, and it begins to form a"
3600,CHAPTER X,"channel; thence to the peat and turf barn, itself built of the same dark"
3601,CHAPTER X,squares as it sheltered; to the sheepfold; to the first cultivated
3602,CHAPTER X,plot of ground; to the lonely cottage and its bleak garden won from the
3603,CHAPTER X,"heath; to the hamlet, the villages, the market-town, the manufactories,"
3604,CHAPTER X,and the seaport. My walks therefore were almost daily on the top
3605,CHAPTER X,"of Quantock, and among its sloping coombes. With my pencil and"
3606,CHAPTER X,"memorandum-book in my hand, I was making studies, as the artists call"
3607,CHAPTER X,"them, and often moulding my thoughts into verse, with the objects and"
3608,CHAPTER X,"imagery immediately before my senses. Many circumstances, evil and good,"
3609,CHAPTER X,"intervened to prevent the completion of the poem, which was to have been"
3610,CHAPTER X,"entitled THE BROOK. Had I finished the work, it was my purpose in the"
3611,CHAPTER X,heat of the moment to have dedicated it to our then committee of public
3612,CHAPTER X,"safety as containing the charts and maps, with which I was to have"
3613,CHAPTER X,supplied the French Government in aid of their plans of invasion. And
3614,CHAPTER X,"these too for a tract of coast that, from Clevedon to Minehead, scarcely"
3615,CHAPTER X,permits the approach of a fishing-boat!
3616,CHAPTER X,
3617,CHAPTER X,All my experience from my first entrance into life to the present hour
3618,CHAPTER X,"is in favour of the warning maxim, that the man, who opposes in toto the"
3619,CHAPTER X,"political or religious zealots of his age, is safer from their obloquy"
3620,CHAPTER X,"than he who differs from them but in one or two points, or perhaps only"
3621,CHAPTER X,in degree. By that transfer of the feelings of private life into the
3622,CHAPTER X,"discussion of public questions, which is the queen bee in the hive of"
3623,CHAPTER X,"party fanaticism, the partisan has more sympathy with an intemperate"
3624,CHAPTER X,"opposite than with a moderate friend. We now enjoy an intermission,"
3625,CHAPTER X,and long may it continue! In addition to far higher and more important
3626,CHAPTER X,"merits, our present Bible societies and other numerous associations"
3627,CHAPTER X,"for national or charitable objects, may serve perhaps to carry off"
3628,CHAPTER X,the superfluous activity and fervour of stirring minds in innocent
3629,CHAPTER X,hyperboles and the bustle of management. But the poison-tree is not
3630,CHAPTER X,"dead, though the sap may for a season have subsided to its roots. At"
3631,CHAPTER X,"least let us not be lulled into such a notion of our entire security, as"
3632,CHAPTER X,"not to keep watch and ward, even on our best feelings. I have seen gross"
3633,CHAPTER X,intolerance shown in support of toleration; sectarian antipathy
3634,CHAPTER X,most obtrusively displayed in the promotion of an undistinguishing
3635,CHAPTER X,"comprehension of sects: and acts of cruelty, (I had almost said,) of"
3636,CHAPTER X,"treachery, committed in furtherance of an object vitally important"
3637,CHAPTER X,to the cause of humanity; and all this by men too of naturally kind
3638,CHAPTER X,dispositions and exemplary conduct.
3639,CHAPTER X,
3640,CHAPTER X,The magic rod of fanaticism is preserved in the very adyta of human
3641,CHAPTER X,nature; and needs only the re-exciting warmth of a master hand to bud
3642,CHAPTER X,forth afresh and produce the old fruits. The horror of the Peasants’ war
3643,CHAPTER X,"in Germany, and the direful effects of the Anabaptists’ tenets,"
3644,CHAPTER X,(which differed only from those of jacobinism by the substitution of
3645,CHAPTER X,"theological for philosophical jargon,) struck all Europe for a time with"
3646,CHAPTER X,affright. Yet little more than a century was sufficient to obliterate
3647,CHAPTER X,all effective memory of these events. The same principles with
3648,CHAPTER X,similar though less dreadful consequences were again at work from the
3649,CHAPTER X,imprisonment of the first Charles to the restoration of his son. The
3650,CHAPTER X,fanatic maxim of extirpating fanaticism by persecution produced a civil
3651,CHAPTER X,war. The war ended in the victory of the insurgents; but the temper
3652,CHAPTER X,"survived, and Milton had abundant grounds for asserting, that “Presbyter"
3653,CHAPTER X,"was but OLD PRIEST writ large!” One good result, thank heaven! of this"
3654,CHAPTER X,zealotry was the re-establishment of the church. And now it might have
3655,CHAPTER X,"been hoped, that the mischievous spirit would have been bound for a"
3656,CHAPTER X,"season, “and a seal set upon him, that he should deceive the nation"
3657,CHAPTER X,no more.” [33] But no! The ball of persecution was taken up with
3658,CHAPTER X,"undiminished vigour by the persecuted. The same fanatic principle that,"
3659,CHAPTER X,"under the solemn oath and covenant, had turned cathedrals into stables,"
3660,CHAPTER X,"destroyed the rarest trophies of art and ancestral piety, and hunted the"
3661,CHAPTER X,"brightest ornaments of learning and religion into holes and corners, now"
3662,CHAPTER X,"marched under episcopal banners, and, having first crowded the prisons"
3663,CHAPTER X,"of England, emptied its whole vial of wrath on the miserable Covenanters"
3664,CHAPTER X,of Scotland [34]. A merciful providence at length constrained both
3665,CHAPTER X,parties to join against a common enemy. A wise government followed;
3666,CHAPTER X,"and the established church became, and now is, not only the brightest"
3667,CHAPTER X,"example, but our best and only sure bulwark, of toleration!--the"
3668,CHAPTER X,true and indispensable bank against a new inundation of persecuting
3669,CHAPTER X,zeal--Esto perpetua!
3670,CHAPTER X,
3671,CHAPTER X,"A long interval of quiet succeeded; or rather, the exhaustion had"
3672,CHAPTER X,produced a cold fit of the ague which was symptomatized by indifference
3673,CHAPTER X,"among the many, and a tendency to infidelity or scepticism in the"
3674,CHAPTER X,"educated classes. At length those feelings of disgust and hatred,"
3675,CHAPTER X,which for a brief while the multitude had attached to the crimes and
3676,CHAPTER X,"absurdities of sectarian and democratic fanaticism, were transferred to"
3677,CHAPTER X,"the oppressive privileges of the noblesse, and the luxury; intrigues and"
3678,CHAPTER X,"favouritism of the continental courts. The same principles, dressed"
3679,CHAPTER X,"in the ostentatious garb of a fashionable philosophy, once more rose"
3680,CHAPTER X,triumphant and effected the French revolution. And have we not
3681,CHAPTER X,"within the last three or four years had reason to apprehend, that"
3682,CHAPTER X,the detestable maxims and correspondent measures of the late French
3683,CHAPTER X,despotism had already bedimmed the public recollections of democratic
3684,CHAPTER X,phrensy; had drawn off to other objects the electric force of the
3685,CHAPTER X,feelings which had massed and upheld those recollections; and that a
3686,CHAPTER X,favourable concurrence of occasions was alone wanting to awaken the
3687,CHAPTER X,thunder and precipitate the lightning from the opposite quarter of the
3688,CHAPTER X,political heaven?
3689,CHAPTER X,
3690,CHAPTER X,"In part from constitutional indolence, which in the very hey-day of"
3691,CHAPTER X,"hope had kept my enthusiasm in check, but still more from the habits and"
3692,CHAPTER X,"influences of a classical education and academic pursuits, scarcely"
3693,CHAPTER X,had a year elapsed from the commencement of my literary and political
3694,CHAPTER X,adventures before my mind sank into a state of thorough disgust and
3695,CHAPTER X,"despondency, both with regard to the disputes and the parties disputant."
3696,CHAPTER X,With more than poetic feeling I exclaimed:
3697,CHAPTER X,
3698,CHAPTER X,"The sensual and the dark rebel in vain,"
3699,CHAPTER X,Slaves by their own compulsion! In mad game
3700,CHAPTER X,"They break their manacles, to wear the name"
3701,CHAPTER X,"Of freedom, graven on a heavier chain."
3702,CHAPTER X,O Liberty! with profitless endeavour
3703,CHAPTER X,Have I pursued thee many a weary hour;
3704,CHAPTER X,"But thou nor swell’st the victor’s pomp, nor ever"
3705,CHAPTER X,Didst breathe thy soul in forms of human power!
3706,CHAPTER X,"Alike from all, howe’er they praise thee,"
3707,CHAPTER X,(Nor prayer nor boastful name delays thee)
3708,CHAPTER X,From Superstition’s harpy minions
3709,CHAPTER X,"And factious Blasphemy’s obscener slaves,"
3710,CHAPTER X,"Thou speedest on thy cherub pinions,"
3711,CHAPTER X,The guide of homeless winds and playmate of the waves!
3712,CHAPTER X,
3713,CHAPTER X,"I retired to a cottage in Somersetshire at the foot of Quantock, and"
3714,CHAPTER X,devoted my thoughts and studies to the foundations of religion and
3715,CHAPTER X,morals. Here I found myself all afloat. Doubts rushed in; broke upon me
3716,CHAPTER X,"“from the fountains of the great deep,” and fell “from the windows"
3717,CHAPTER X,of heaven.” The fontal truths of natural religion and the books of
3718,CHAPTER X,Revelation alike contributed to the flood; and it was long ere my ark
3719,CHAPTER X,"touched on an Ararat, and rested. The idea of the Supreme Being appeared"
3720,CHAPTER X,to me to be as necessarily implied in all particular modes of being as
3721,CHAPTER X,the idea of infinite space in all the geometrical figures by which space
3722,CHAPTER X,"is limited. I was pleased with the Cartesian opinion, that the idea of"
3723,CHAPTER X,God is distinguished from all other ideas by involving its reality; but
3724,CHAPTER X,"I was not wholly satisfied. I began then to ask myself, what proof I"
3725,CHAPTER X,had of the outward existence of anything? Of this sheet of paper for
3726,CHAPTER X,"instance, as a thing in itself, separate from the phaenomenon or image"
3727,CHAPTER X,"in my perception. I saw, that in the nature of things such proof is"
3728,CHAPTER X,"impossible; and that of all modes of being, that are not objects of the"
3729,CHAPTER X,"senses, the existence is assumed by a logical necessity arising from the"
3730,CHAPTER X,"constitution of the mind itself,--by the absence of all motive to"
3731,CHAPTER X,"doubt it, not from any absolute contradiction in the supposition of the"
3732,CHAPTER X,"contrary. Still the existence of a Being, the ground of all existence,"
3733,CHAPTER X,"was not yet the existence of a moral creator, and governour. “In the"
3734,CHAPTER X,"position, that all reality is either contained in the necessary being as"
3735,CHAPTER X,"an attribute, or exists through him, as its ground, it remains undecided"
3736,CHAPTER X,whether the properties of intelligence and will are to be referred to
3737,CHAPTER X,the Supreme Being in the former or only in the latter sense; as inherent
3738,CHAPTER X,"attributes, or only as consequences that have existence in other things"
3739,CHAPTER X,"through him [35]. Were the latter the truth, then notwithstanding all"
3740,CHAPTER X,the pre-eminence which must be assigned to the Eternal First from the
3741,CHAPTER X,"sufficiency, unity, and independence of his being, as the dread ground"
3742,CHAPTER X,"of the universe, his nature would yet fall far short of that, which we"
3743,CHAPTER X,"are bound to comprehend in the idea of GOD. For, without any knowledge"
3744,CHAPTER X,"or determining resolve of its own, it would only be a blind"
3745,CHAPTER X,necessary ground of other things and other spirits; and thus would
3746,CHAPTER X,be distinguished from the FATE of certain ancient philosophers in no
3747,CHAPTER X,"respect, but that of being more definitely and intelligibly described.”"
3748,CHAPTER X,
3749,CHAPTER X,"For a very long time, indeed, I could not reconcile personality with"
3750,CHAPTER X,"infinity; and my head was with Spinoza, though my whole heart remained"
3751,CHAPTER X,"with Paul and John. Yet there had dawned upon me, even before I had met"
3752,CHAPTER X,"with the CRITIQUE OF THE PURE REASON, a certain guiding light. If the"
3753,CHAPTER X,mere intellect could make no certain discovery of a holy and intelligent
3754,CHAPTER X,"first cause, it might yet supply a demonstration, that no legitimate"
3755,CHAPTER X,argument could be drawn from the intellect against its truth. And what
3756,CHAPTER X,"is this more than St. Paul’s assertion, that by wisdom,--(more properly"
3757,CHAPTER X,translated by the powers of reasoning)--no man ever arrived at the
3758,CHAPTER X,"knowledge of God? What more than the sublimest, and probably the oldest,"
3759,CHAPTER X,"book on earth has taught us,"
3760,CHAPTER X,
3761,CHAPTER X,Silver and gold man searcheth out:
3762,CHAPTER X,"Bringeth the ore out of the earth, and darkness into light."
3763,CHAPTER X,
3764,CHAPTER X,But where findeth he wisdom?
3765,CHAPTER X,Where is the place of understanding?
3766,CHAPTER X,
3767,CHAPTER X,The abyss crieth; it is not in me!
3768,CHAPTER X,Ocean echoeth back; not in me!
3769,CHAPTER X,
3770,CHAPTER X,Whence then cometh wisdom?
3771,CHAPTER X,Where dwelleth understanding?
3772,CHAPTER X,
3773,CHAPTER X,Hidden from the eyes of the living
3774,CHAPTER X,Kept secret from the fowls of heaven!
3775,CHAPTER X,
3776,CHAPTER X,Hell and death answer;
3777,CHAPTER X,We have heard the rumour thereof from afar!
3778,CHAPTER X,
3779,CHAPTER X,GOD marketh out the road to it;
3780,CHAPTER X,GOD knoweth its abiding place!
3781,CHAPTER X,
3782,CHAPTER X,He beholdeth the ends of the earth;
3783,CHAPTER X,He surveyeth what is beneath the heavens!
3784,CHAPTER X,
3785,CHAPTER X,"And as he weighed out the winds, and measured the sea,"
3786,CHAPTER X,"And appointed laws to the rain,"
3787,CHAPTER X,"And a path to the thunder,"
3788,CHAPTER X,A path to the flashes of the lightning!
3789,CHAPTER X,
3790,CHAPTER X,"Then did he see it,"
3791,CHAPTER X,And he counted it;
3792,CHAPTER X,"He searched into the depth thereof,"
3793,CHAPTER X,And with a line did he compass it round!
3794,CHAPTER X,
3795,CHAPTER X,"But to man he said,"
3796,CHAPTER X,The fear of the Lord is wisdom for thee!
3797,CHAPTER X,"And to avoid evil,"
3798,CHAPTER X,That is thy understanding. [36]
3799,CHAPTER X,
3800,CHAPTER X,"I become convinced, that religion, as both the cornerstone and the"
3801,CHAPTER X,"key-stone of morality, must have a moral origin; so far at least, that"
3802,CHAPTER X,"the evidence of its doctrines could not, like the truths of abstract"
3803,CHAPTER X,"science, be wholly independent of the will. It were therefore to be"
3804,CHAPTER X,"expected, that its fundamental truth would be such as might be denied;"
3805,CHAPTER X,"though only, by the fool, and even by the fool from the madness of the"
3806,CHAPTER X,heart alone!
3807,CHAPTER X,
3808,CHAPTER X,"The question then concerning our faith in the existence of a God, not"
3809,CHAPTER X,"only as the ground of the universe by his essence, but as its maker and"
3810,CHAPTER X,"judge by his wisdom and holy will, appeared to stand thus. The sciential"
3811,CHAPTER X,"reason, the objects of which are purely theoretical, remains neutral, as"
3812,CHAPTER X,long as its name and semblance are not usurped by the opponents of the
3813,CHAPTER X,doctrine. But it then becomes an effective ally by exposing the false
3814,CHAPTER X,"show of demonstration, or by evincing the equal demonstrability of the"
3815,CHAPTER X,contrary from premises equally logical [37]. The understanding meantime
3816,CHAPTER X,"suggests, the analogy of experience facilitates, the belief. Nature"
3817,CHAPTER X,"excites and recalls it, as by a perpetual revelation. Our feelings"
3818,CHAPTER X,almost necessitate it; and the law of conscience peremptorily commands
3819,CHAPTER X,"it. The arguments, that at all apply to it, are in its favour; and"
3820,CHAPTER X,"there is nothing against it, but its own sublimity. It could not be"
3821,CHAPTER X,intellectually more evident without becoming morally less effective;
3822,CHAPTER X,without counteracting its own end by sacrificing the life of faith to
3823,CHAPTER X,the cold mechanism of a worth less because compulsory assent. The belief
3824,CHAPTER X,"of a God and a future state, (if a passive acquiescence may be flattered"
3825,CHAPTER X,"with the name of belief,) does not indeed always beget a good heart;"
3826,CHAPTER X,"but a good heart so naturally begets the belief, that the very few"
3827,CHAPTER X,exceptions must be regarded as strange anomalies from strange and
3828,CHAPTER X,unfortunate circumstances.
3829,CHAPTER X,
3830,CHAPTER X,From these premises I proceeded to draw the following conclusions.
3831,CHAPTER X,"First, that having once fully admitted the existence of an infinite yet"
3832,CHAPTER X,"self-conscious Creator, we are not allowed to ground the irrationality"
3833,CHAPTER X,of any other article of faith on arguments which would equally prove
3834,CHAPTER X,"that to be irrational, which we had allowed to be real. Secondly, that"
3835,CHAPTER X,whatever is deducible from the admission of a self-comprehending and
3836,CHAPTER X,creative spirit may be legitimately used in proof of the possibility
3837,CHAPTER X,of any further mystery concerning the divine nature. Possibilitatem
3838,CHAPTER X,"mysteriorum, (Trinitatis, etc.) contra insultus Infidelium et"
3839,CHAPTER X,"Haereticorum a contradictionibus vindico; haud quidem veritatem, quae"
3840,CHAPTER X,revelatione sola stabiliri possit; says Leibnitz in a letter to his
3841,CHAPTER X,Duke. He then adds the following just and important remark. “In
3842,CHAPTER X,vain will tradition or texts of scripture be adduced in support of a
3843,CHAPTER X,"doctrine, donec clava impossibilitatis et contradictionis e manibus"
3844,CHAPTER X,"horum Herculum extorta fuerit. For the heretic will still reply, that"
3845,CHAPTER X,"texts, the literal sense of which is not so much above as directly"
3846,CHAPTER X,"against all reason, must be understood figuratively, as Herod is a fox,"
3847,CHAPTER X,and so forth.”
3848,CHAPTER X,
3849,CHAPTER X,"These principles I held, philosophically, while in respect of revealed"
3850,CHAPTER X,religion I remained a zealous Unitarian. I considered the idea of the
3851,CHAPTER X,"Trinity a fair scholastic inference from the being of God, as a creative"
3852,CHAPTER X,intelligence; and that it was therefore entitled to the rank of an
3853,CHAPTER X,esoteric doctrine of natural religion. But seeing in the same no
3854,CHAPTER X,"practical or moral bearing, I confined it to the schools of philosophy."
3855,CHAPTER X,"The admission of the Logos, as hypostasized (that is, neither a mere"
3856,CHAPTER X,"attribute, nor a personification) in no respect removed my doubts"
3857,CHAPTER X,concerning the Incarnation and the Redemption by the cross; which I
3858,CHAPTER X,could neither reconcile in reason with the impassiveness of the Divine
3859,CHAPTER X,"Being, nor in my moral feelings with the sacred distinction between"
3860,CHAPTER X,"things and persons, the vicarious payment of a debt and the vicarious"
3861,CHAPTER X,expiation of guilt. A more thorough revolution in my philosophic
3862,CHAPTER X,"principles, and a deeper insight into my own heart, were yet wanting."
3863,CHAPTER X,"Nevertheless, I cannot doubt, that the difference of my metaphysical"
3864,CHAPTER X,notions from those of Unitarians in general contributed to my final
3865,CHAPTER X,re-conversion to the whole truth in Christ; even as according to his own
3866,CHAPTER X,confession the books of certain Platonic philosophers (libri quorundam
3867,CHAPTER X,Platonicorum) commenced the rescue of St. Augustine’s faith from the
3868,CHAPTER X,same error aggravated by the far darker accompaniment of the Manichaean
3869,CHAPTER X,heresy.
3870,CHAPTER X,
3871,CHAPTER X,"While my mind was thus perplexed, by a gracious providence for which"
3872,CHAPTER X,"I can never be sufficiently grateful, the generous and munificent"
3873,CHAPTER X,"patronage of Mr. Josiah, and Mr. Thomas Wedgwood enabled me to finish"
3874,CHAPTER X,my education in Germany. Instead of troubling others with my own crude
3875,CHAPTER X,"notions and juvenile compositions, I was thenceforward better employed"
3876,CHAPTER X,in attempting to store my own head with the wisdom of others. I made the
3877,CHAPTER X,best use of my time and means; and there is therefore no period of my
3878,CHAPTER X,life on which I can look back with such unmingled satisfaction. After
3879,CHAPTER X,acquiring a tolerable sufficiency in the German language [38] at
3880,CHAPTER X,"Ratzeburg, which with my voyage and journey thither I have described in"
3881,CHAPTER X,"The Friend, I proceeded through Hanover to Goettingen."
3882,CHAPTER X,
3883,CHAPTER X,"Here I regularly attended the lectures on physiology in the morning, and"
3884,CHAPTER X,"on natural history in the evening, under Blumenbach, a name as dear to"
3885,CHAPTER X,"every Englishman who has studied at that university, as it is venerable"
3886,CHAPTER X,to men of science throughout Europe! Eichhorn’s lectures on the New
3887,CHAPTER X,"Testament were repeated to me from notes by a student from Ratzeburg,"
3888,CHAPTER X,"a young man of sound learning and indefatigable industry, who is now,"
3889,CHAPTER X,"I believe, a professor of the oriental languages at Heidelberg. But my"
3890,CHAPTER X,chief efforts were directed towards a grounded knowledge of the German
3891,CHAPTER X,language and literature. From professor Tychsen I received as many
3892,CHAPTER X,lessons in the Gothic of Ulphilas as sufficed to make me acquainted with
3893,CHAPTER X,"its grammar, and the radical words of most frequent occurrence; and with"
3894,CHAPTER X,"the occasional assistance of the same philosophical linguist, I read"
3895,CHAPTER X,"through [39] Ottfried’s metrical paraphrase of the gospel, and the most"
3896,CHAPTER X,"important remains of the Theotiscan, or the transitional state of the"
3897,CHAPTER X,Teutonic language from the Gothic to the old German of the Swabian
3898,CHAPTER X,period. Of this period--(the polished dialect of which is analogous to
3899,CHAPTER X,"that of our Chaucer, and which leaves the philosophic student in doubt,"
3900,CHAPTER X,whether the language has not since then lost more in sweetness and
3901,CHAPTER X,"flexibility, than it has gained in condensation and copiousness)--I"
3902,CHAPTER X,"read with sedulous accuracy the Minnesinger (or singers of love, the"
3903,CHAPTER X,Provencal poets of the Swabian court) and the metrical romances; and
3904,CHAPTER X,"then laboured through sufficient specimens of the master singers, their"
3905,CHAPTER X,degenerate successors; not however without occasional pleasure from the
3906,CHAPTER X,"rude, yet interesting strains of Hans Sachs, the cobbler of Nuremberg."
3907,CHAPTER X,Of this man’s genius five folio volumes with double columns are
3908,CHAPTER X,"extant in print, and nearly an equal number in manuscript; yet the"
3909,CHAPTER X,"indefatigable bard takes care to inform his readers, that he never made"
3910,CHAPTER X,"a shoe the less, but had virtuously reared a large family by the labour"
3911,CHAPTER X,of his hands.
3912,CHAPTER X,
3913,CHAPTER X,"In Pindar, Chaucer, Dante, Milton, and many more, we have instances of"
3914,CHAPTER X,the close connection of poetic genius with the love of liberty and of
3915,CHAPTER X,"genuine reformation. The moral sense at least will not be outraged, if"
3916,CHAPTER X,"I add to the list the name of this honest shoemaker, (a trade by the by"
3917,CHAPTER X,remarkable for the production of philosophers and poets).
3918,CHAPTER X,
3919,CHAPTER X,"His poem entitled THE MORNING STAR, was the very first publication that"
3920,CHAPTER X,appeared in praise and support of Luther; and an excellent hymn of Hans
3921,CHAPTER X,"Sachs, which has been deservedly translated into almost all the European"
3922,CHAPTER X,"languages, was commonly sung in the Protestant churches, whenever the"
3923,CHAPTER X,heroic reformer visited them.
3924,CHAPTER X,
3925,CHAPTER X,"In Luther’s own German writings, and eminently in his translation of"
3926,CHAPTER X,"the Bible, the German language commenced. I mean the language as it is"
3927,CHAPTER X,"at present written; that which is called the High-German, as"
3928,CHAPTER X,"contra-distinguished from the Platt-Teutsch, the dialect on the flat or"
3929,CHAPTER X,"northern countries, and from the Ober-Teutsch, the language of the"
3930,CHAPTER X,middle and Southern Germany. The High German is indeed a lingua
3931,CHAPTER X,"communis, not actually the native language of any province, but the"
3932,CHAPTER X,choice and fragrancy of all the dialects. From this cause it is at once
3933,CHAPTER X,the most copious and the most grammatical of all the European tongues.
3934,CHAPTER X,
3935,CHAPTER X,Within less than a century after Luther’s death the German was inundated
3936,CHAPTER X,with pedantic barbarisms. A few volumes of this period I read through
3937,CHAPTER X,from motives of curiosity; for it is not easy to imagine any thing more
3938,CHAPTER X,"fantastic, than the very appearance of their pages. Almost every third"
3939,CHAPTER X,"word is a Latin word with a Germanized ending, the Latin portion being"
3940,CHAPTER X,"always printed in Roman letters, while in the last syllable the German"
3941,CHAPTER X,character is retained.
3942,CHAPTER X,
3943,CHAPTER X,"At length, about the year 1620, Opitz arose, whose genius more nearly"
3944,CHAPTER X,"resembled that of Dryden than any other poet, who at present occurs to"
3945,CHAPTER X,"my recollection. In the opinion of Lessing, the most acute of critics,"
3946,CHAPTER X,"and of Adelung, the first of Lexicographers, Opitz, and the Silesian"
3947,CHAPTER X,"poets, his followers, not only restored the language, but still remain"
3948,CHAPTER X,the models of pure diction. A stranger has no vote on such a question;
3949,CHAPTER X,but after repeated perusal of the works of Opitz my feelings justified
3950,CHAPTER X,"the verdict, and I seemed to have acquired from them a sort of tact for"
3951,CHAPTER X,what is genuine in the style of later writers.
3952,CHAPTER X,
3953,CHAPTER X,"Of the splendid aera, which commenced with Gellert, Klopstock, Ramler,"
3954,CHAPTER X,"Lessing, and their compeers, I need not speak. With the opportunities"
3955,CHAPTER X,"which I enjoyed, it would have been disgraceful not to have been"
3956,CHAPTER X,familiar with their writings; and I have already said as much as the
3957,CHAPTER X,"present biographical sketch requires concerning the German philosophers,"
3958,CHAPTER X,"whose works, for the greater part, I became acquainted with at a far"
3959,CHAPTER X,later period.
3960,CHAPTER X,
3961,CHAPTER X,Soon after my return from Germany I was solicited to undertake the
3962,CHAPTER X,literary and political department in the Morning Post; and I acceded to
3963,CHAPTER X,the proposal on the condition that the paper should thenceforwards be
3964,CHAPTER X,"conducted on certain fixed and announced principles, and that I should"
3965,CHAPTER X,neither be obliged nor requested to deviate from them in favour of any
3966,CHAPTER X,"party or any event. In consequence, that journal became and for many"
3967,CHAPTER X,"years continued anti-ministerial indeed, yet with a very qualified"
3968,CHAPTER X,"approbation of the opposition, and with far greater earnestness and zeal"
3969,CHAPTER X,both anti-Jacobin and anti-Gallican. To this hour I cannot find reason
3970,CHAPTER X,to approve of the first war either in its commencement or its conduct.
3971,CHAPTER X,"Nor can I understand, with what reason either Mr. Perceval, (whom I"
3972,CHAPTER X,am singular enough to regard as the best and wisest minister of this
3973,CHAPTER X,"reign,) nor the present Administration, can be said to have pursued the"
3974,CHAPTER X,"plans of Mr. Pitt. The love of their country, and perseverant hostility"
3975,CHAPTER X,to French principles and French ambition are indeed honourable qualities
3976,CHAPTER X,common to them and to their predecessor. But it appears to me as clear
3977,CHAPTER X,"as the evidence of the facts can render any question of history, that"
3978,CHAPTER X,the successes of the Perceval and of the existing ministry have been
3979,CHAPTER X,owing to their having pursued measures the direct contrary to Mr.
3980,CHAPTER X,Pitt’s. Such for instance are the concentration of the national force to
3981,CHAPTER X,"one object; the abandonment of the subsidizing policy, so far at least"
3982,CHAPTER X,"as neither to goad nor bribe the continental courts into war, till"
3983,CHAPTER X,the convictions of their subjects had rendered it a war of their own
3984,CHAPTER X,"seeking; and above all, in their manly and generous reliance on the good"
3985,CHAPTER X,"sense of the English people, and on that loyalty which is linked to"
3986,CHAPTER X,the very [40] heart of the nation by the system of credit and the
3987,CHAPTER X,interdependence of property.
3988,CHAPTER X,
3989,CHAPTER X,"Be this as it may, I am persuaded that the Morning Post proved a far"
3990,CHAPTER X,"more useful ally to the Government in its most important objects,"
3991,CHAPTER X,in consequence of its being generally considered as moderately anti-
3992,CHAPTER X,"ministerial, than if it had been the avowed eulogist of Mr. Pitt. The"
3993,CHAPTER X,"few, whose curiosity or fancy should lead them to turn over the journals"
3994,CHAPTER X,"of that date, may find a small proof of this in the frequent charges"
3995,CHAPTER X,"made by the Morning Chronicle, that such and such essays or leading"
3996,CHAPTER X,paragraphs had been sent from the Treasury. The rapid and unusual
3997,CHAPTER X,"increase in the sale of the Morning Post is a sufficient pledge, that"
3998,CHAPTER X,genuine impartiality with a respectable portion of literary talent
3999,CHAPTER X,will secure the success of a newspaper without the aid of party
4000,CHAPTER X,or ministerial patronage. But by impartiality I mean an honest and
4001,CHAPTER X,enlightened adherence to a code of intelligible principles previously
4002,CHAPTER X,"announced, and faithfully referred to in support of every judgment"
4003,CHAPTER X,"on men and events; not indiscriminate abuse, not the indulgence of an"
4004,CHAPTER X,"editor’s own malignant passions, and still less, if that be possible,"
4005,CHAPTER X,"a determination to make money by flattering the envy and cupidity, the"
4006,CHAPTER X,vindictive restlessness and self-conceit of the half-witted vulgar; a
4007,CHAPTER X,"determination almost fiendish, but which, I have been informed, has"
4008,CHAPTER X,"been boastfully avowed by one man, the most notorious of these"
4009,CHAPTER X,mob-sycophants! From the commencement of the Addington administration to
4010,CHAPTER X,"the present day, whatever I have written in THE MORNING POST, or (after"
4011,CHAPTER X,"that paper was transferred to other proprietors) in THE COURIER, has"
4012,CHAPTER X,been in defence or furtherance of the measures of Government.
4013,CHAPTER X,
4014,CHAPTER X,Things of this nature scarce survive that night
4015,CHAPTER X,That gives them birth; they perish in the sight;
4016,CHAPTER X,"Cast by so far from after-life, that there"
4017,CHAPTER X,"Can scarcely aught be said, but that they were!"
4018,CHAPTER X,
4019,CHAPTER X,"Yet in these labours I employed, and, in the belief of partial friends"
4020,CHAPTER X,"wasted, the prime and manhood of my intellect. Most assuredly, they"
4021,CHAPTER X,added nothing to my fortune or my reputation. The industry of the week
4022,CHAPTER X,supplied the necessities of the week. From government or the friends of
4023,CHAPTER X,"government I not only never received remuneration, nor ever expected it;"
4024,CHAPTER X,"but I was never honoured with a single acknowledgment, or expression"
4025,CHAPTER X,of satisfaction. Yet the retrospect is far from painful or matter of
4026,CHAPTER X,regret. I am not indeed silly enough to take as any thing more than a
4027,CHAPTER X,"violent hyperbole of party debate, Mr. Fox’s assertion that the late war"
4028,CHAPTER X,(I trust that the epithet is not prematurely applied) was a war produced
4029,CHAPTER X,by the Morning Post; or I should be proud to have the words inscribed on
4030,CHAPTER X,"my tomb. As little do I regard the circumstance, that I was a specified"
4031,CHAPTER X,object of Buonaparte’s resentment during my residence in Italy in
4032,CHAPTER X,consequence of those essays in the Morning Post during the peace of
4033,CHAPTER X,"Amiens. Of this I was warned, directly, by Baron Von Humboldt, the"
4034,CHAPTER X,"Prussian Plenipotentiary, who at that time was the minister of the"
4035,CHAPTER X,"Prussian court at Rome; and indirectly, through his secretary,"
4036,CHAPTER X,by Cardinal Fesch himself. Nor do I lay any greater weight on the
4037,CHAPTER X,"confirming fact, that an order for my arrest was sent from Paris, from"
4038,CHAPTER X,"which danger I was rescued by the kindness of a noble Benedictine, and"
4039,CHAPTER X,"the gracious connivance of that good old man, the present Pope. For the"
4040,CHAPTER X,"late tyrant’s vindictive appetite was omnivorous, and preyed equally on"
4041,CHAPTER X,"a Duc d’Enghien [41], and the writer of a newspaper paragraph. Like a"
4042,CHAPTER X,"true vulture [42], Napoleon with an eye not less telescopic, and with a"
4043,CHAPTER X,"taste equally coarse in his ravin, could descend from the most dazzling"
4044,CHAPTER X,"heights to pounce on the leveret in the brake, or even on the field"
4045,CHAPTER X,mouse amid the grass. But I do derive a gratification from the
4046,CHAPTER X,"knowledge, that my essays contributed to introduce the practice of"
4047,CHAPTER X,placing the questions and events of the day in a moral point of view;
4048,CHAPTER X,in giving a dignity to particular measures by tracing their policy or
4049,CHAPTER X,"impolicy to permanent principles, and an interest to principles by the"
4050,CHAPTER X,application of them to individual measures. In Mr. Burke’s writings
4051,CHAPTER X,indeed the germs of almost all political truths may be found. But I
4052,CHAPTER X,dare assume to myself the merit of having first explicitly defined
4053,CHAPTER X,and analyzed the nature of Jacobinism; and that in distinguishing the
4054,CHAPTER X,"Jacobin from the republican, the democrat, and the mere demagogue, I"
4055,CHAPTER X,"both rescued the word from remaining a mere term of abuse, and put on"
4056,CHAPTER X,"their guard many honest minds, who even in their heat of zeal against"
4057,CHAPTER X,"Jacobinism, admitted or supported principles from which the worst parts"
4058,CHAPTER X,of that system may be legitimately deduced. That these are not
4059,CHAPTER X,"necessary practical results of such principles, we owe to that fortunate"
4060,CHAPTER X,"inconsequence of our nature, which permits the heart to rectify the"
4061,CHAPTER X,errors of the understanding. The detailed examination of the consular
4062,CHAPTER X,"Government and its pretended constitution, and the proof given by me,"
4063,CHAPTER X,"that it was a consummate despotism in masquerade, extorted a recantation"
4064,CHAPTER X,"even from the Morning Chronicle, which had previously extolled this"
4065,CHAPTER X,constitution as the perfection of a wise and regulated liberty. On every
4066,CHAPTER X,"great occurrence I endeavoured to discover in past history the event,"
4067,CHAPTER X,"that most nearly resembled it. I procured, wherever it was possible,"
4068,CHAPTER X,"the contemporary historians, memorialists, and pamphleteers. Then fairly"
4069,CHAPTER X,"subtracting the points of difference from those of likeness, as the"
4070,CHAPTER X,"balance favoured the former or the latter, I conjectured that the result"
4071,CHAPTER X,would be the same or different. In the series of essays entitled “A
4072,CHAPTER X,"comparison of France under Napoleon with Rome under the first Caesars,”"
4073,CHAPTER X,and in those which followed “On the probable final restoration of the
4074,CHAPTER X,"Bourbons,” I feel myself authorized to affirm, by the effect produced on"
4075,CHAPTER X,"many intelligent men, that, were the dates wanting, it might have"
4076,CHAPTER X,been suspected that the essays had been written within the last twelve
4077,CHAPTER X,months. The same plan I pursued at the commencement of the Spanish
4078,CHAPTER X,"revolution, and with the same success, taking the war of the United"
4079,CHAPTER X,Provinces with Philip II as the ground work of the comparison. I have
4080,CHAPTER X,"mentioned this from no motives of vanity, nor even from motives of self"
4081,CHAPTER X,"defence, which would justify a certain degree of egotism, especially"
4082,CHAPTER X,"if it be considered, how often and grossly I have been attacked for"
4083,CHAPTER X,"sentiments, which I have exerted my best powers to confute and expose,"
4084,CHAPTER X,and how grievously these charges acted to my disadvantage while I was
4085,CHAPTER X,"in Malta. Or rather they would have done so, if my own feelings had not"
4086,CHAPTER X,precluded the wish of a settled establishment in that island. But I
4087,CHAPTER X,"have mentioned it from the full persuasion that, armed with the two-fold"
4088,CHAPTER X,"knowledge of history and the human mind, a man will scarcely err in his"
4089,CHAPTER X,"judgment concerning the sum total of any future national event, if he"
4090,CHAPTER X,"have been able to procure the original documents of the past, together"
4091,CHAPTER X,"with authentic accounts of the present, and if he have a philosophic"
4092,CHAPTER X,"tact for what is truly important in facts, and in most instances"
4093,CHAPTER X,therefore for such facts as the dignity of history has excluded from
4094,CHAPTER X,"the volumes of our modern compilers, by the courtesy of the age entitled"
4095,CHAPTER X,historians.
4096,CHAPTER X,
4097,CHAPTER X,"To have lived in vain must be a painful thought to any man, and"
4098,CHAPTER X,especially so to him who has made literature his profession. I should
4099,CHAPTER X,"therefore rather condole than be angry with the mind, which could"
4100,CHAPTER X,"attribute to no worthier feelings than those of vanity or self-love,"
4101,CHAPTER X,the satisfaction which I acknowledged myself to have enjoyed from the
4102,CHAPTER X,republication of my political essays (either whole or as extracts) not
4103,CHAPTER X,"only in many of our own provincial papers, but in the federal journals"
4104,CHAPTER X,throughout America. I regarded it as some proof of my not having
4105,CHAPTER X,"laboured altogether in vain, that from the articles written by me"
4106,CHAPTER X,shortly before and at the commencement of the late unhappy war with
4107,CHAPTER X,"America, not only the sentiments were adopted, but in some instances the"
4108,CHAPTER X,"very language, in several of the Massachusetts state papers."
4109,CHAPTER X,
4110,CHAPTER X,But no one of these motives nor all conjointly would have impelled me
4111,CHAPTER X,"to a statement so uncomfortable to my own feelings, had not my character"
4112,CHAPTER X,"been repeatedly attacked, by an unjustifiable intrusion on private life,"
4113,CHAPTER X,"as of a man incorrigibly idle, and who intrusted not only with ample"
4114,CHAPTER X,"talents, but favoured with unusual opportunities of improving them, had"
4115,CHAPTER X,"nevertheless suffered them to rust away without any efficient exertion,"
4116,CHAPTER X,either for his own good or that of his fellow creatures. Even if the
4117,CHAPTER X,"compositions, which I have made public, and that too in a form the most"
4118,CHAPTER X,"certain of an extensive circulation, though the least flattering to an"
4119,CHAPTER X,"author’s self-love, had been published in books, they would have"
4120,CHAPTER X,"filled a respectable number of volumes, though every passage of merely"
4121,CHAPTER X,temporary interest were omitted. My prose writings have been charged
4122,CHAPTER X,with a disproportionate demand on the attention; with an excess of
4123,CHAPTER X,refinement in the mode of arriving at truths; with beating the ground
4124,CHAPTER X,for that which might have been run down by the eye; with the length and
4125,CHAPTER X,laborious construction of my periods; in short with obscurity and the
4126,CHAPTER X,love of paradox. But my severest critics have not pretended to have
4127,CHAPTER X,"found in my compositions triviality, or traces of a mind that shrunk"
4128,CHAPTER X,from the toil of thinking. No one has charged me with tricking out in
4129,CHAPTER X,"other words the thoughts of others, or with hashing up anew the cramben"
4130,CHAPTER X,jam decies coctam of English literature or philosophy. Seldom have I
4131,CHAPTER X,"written that in a day, the acquisition or investigation of which had not"
4132,CHAPTER X,cost me the previous labour of a month.
4133,CHAPTER X,
4134,CHAPTER X,But are books the only channel through which the stream of intellectual
4135,CHAPTER X,usefulness can flow? Is the diffusion of truth to be estimated by
4136,CHAPTER X,"publications; or publications by the truth, which they diffuse or at"
4137,CHAPTER X,least contain? I speak it in the excusable warmth of a mind stung by an
4138,CHAPTER X,"accusation, which has not only been advanced in reviews of the widest"
4139,CHAPTER X,"circulation, not only registered in the bulkiest works of periodical"
4140,CHAPTER X,"literature, but by frequency of repetition has become an admitted fact"
4141,CHAPTER X,"in private literary circles, and thoughtlessly repeated by too many who"
4142,CHAPTER X,"call themselves my friends, and whose own recollections ought to have"
4143,CHAPTER X,suggested a contrary testimony. Would that the criterion of a scholar’s
4144,CHAPTER X,"utility were the number and moral value of the truths, which he has been"
4145,CHAPTER X,the means of throwing into the general circulation; or the number and
4146,CHAPTER X,"value of the minds, whom by his conversation or letters, he has excited"
4147,CHAPTER X,"into activity, and supplied with the germs of their after-growth!"
4148,CHAPTER X,"A distinguished rank might not indeed, even then, be awarded to"
4149,CHAPTER X,my exertions; but I should dare look forward with confidence to
4150,CHAPTER X,an honourable acquittal. I should dare appeal to the numerous and
4151,CHAPTER X,"respectable audiences, which at different times and in different places"
4152,CHAPTER X,"honoured my lecture rooms with their attendance, whether the points"
4153,CHAPTER X,"of view from which the subjects treated of were surveyed,--whether the"
4154,CHAPTER X,"grounds of my reasoning were such, as they had heard or read elsewhere,"
4155,CHAPTER X,or have since found in previous publications. I can conscientiously
4156,CHAPTER X,"declare, that the complete success of the REMORSE on the first night of"
4157,CHAPTER X,"its representation did not give me as great or as heart-felt a pleasure,"
4158,CHAPTER X,as the observation that the pit and boxes were crowded with faces
4159,CHAPTER X,"familiar to me, though of individuals whose names I did not know, and"
4160,CHAPTER X,"of whom I knew nothing, but that they had attended one or other of my"
4161,CHAPTER X,courses of lectures. It is an excellent though perhaps somewhat vulgar
4162,CHAPTER X,"proverb, that there are cases where a man may be as well “in for a pound"
4163,CHAPTER X,"as for a penny.” To those, who from ignorance of the serious injury"
4164,CHAPTER X,I have received from this rumour of having dreamed away my life to no
4165,CHAPTER X,"purpose, injuries which I unwillingly remember at all, much less am"
4166,CHAPTER X,"disposed to record in a sketch of my literary life; or to those, who"
4167,CHAPTER X,"from their own feelings, or the gratification they derive from thinking"
4168,CHAPTER X,"contemptuously of others, would like job’s comforters attribute these"
4169,CHAPTER X,"complaints, extorted from me by the sense of wrong, to self conceit or"
4170,CHAPTER X,"presumptuous vanity, I have already furnished such ample materials, that"
4171,CHAPTER X,I shall gain nothing by withholding the remainder. I will not
4172,CHAPTER X,"therefore hesitate to ask the consciences of those, who from their long"
4173,CHAPTER X,acquaintance with me and with the circumstances are best qualified to
4174,CHAPTER X,"decide or be my judges, whether the restitution of the suum cuique would"
4175,CHAPTER X,increase or detract from my literary reputation. In this exculpation
4176,CHAPTER X,"I hope to be understood as speaking of myself comparatively, and in"
4177,CHAPTER X,"proportion to the claims, which others are entitled to make on my time"
4178,CHAPTER X,"or my talents. By what I have effected, am I to be judged by my fellow"
4179,CHAPTER X,"men; what I could have done, is a question for my own conscience. On"
4180,CHAPTER X,my own account I may perhaps have had sufficient reason to lament my
4181,CHAPTER X,"deficiency in self-control, and the neglect of concentering my powers"
4182,CHAPTER X,to the realization of some permanent work. But to verse rather than to
4183,CHAPTER X,"prose, if to either, belongs the voice of mourning for"
4184,CHAPTER X,
4185,CHAPTER X,"Keen pangs of Love, awakening as a babe"
4186,CHAPTER X,"Turbulent, with an outcry in the heart;"
4187,CHAPTER X,And fears self-willed that shunned the eye of hope;
4188,CHAPTER X,And hope that scarce would know itself from fear;
4189,CHAPTER X,"Sense of past youth, and manhood come in vain,"
4190,CHAPTER X,And genius given and knowledge won in vain;
4191,CHAPTER X,"And all which I had culled in wood-walks wild,"
4192,CHAPTER X,"And all which patient toil had reared, and all,"
4193,CHAPTER X,Commune with thee had opened out--but flowers
4194,CHAPTER X,"Strewed on my corpse, and borne upon my bier,"
4195,CHAPTER X,"In the same coffin, for the self-same grave!"
4196,CHAPTER X,
4197,CHAPTER X,"These will exist, for the future, I trust, only in the poetic strains,"
4198,CHAPTER X,"which the feelings at the time called forth. In those only, gentle"
4199,CHAPTER X,"reader,"
4200,CHAPTER X,
4201,CHAPTER X,"Affectus animi varios, bellumque sequacis"
4202,CHAPTER X,"Perlegis invidiae, curasque revolvis inanes,"
4203,CHAPTER X,Quas humilis tenero stylus olim effudit in aevo.
4204,CHAPTER X,"Perlegis et lacrymas, et quod pharetratus acuta"
4205,CHAPTER X,Ille puer puero fecit mihi cuspide vulnus.
4206,CHAPTER X,"Omnia paulatim consumit longior aetas,"
4207,CHAPTER X,"Vivendoque simul morimur, rapimurque manendo."
4208,CHAPTER X,Ipse mihi collatus enim non ille videbor;
4209,CHAPTER X,"Frons alia est, moresque alii, nova mentis imago,"
4210,CHAPTER X,Vox aliudque sonat--Jamque observatio vitae
4211,CHAPTER X,"Multa dedit--lugere nihil, ferre omnia; jamque"
4212,CHAPTER X,Paulatim lacrymas rerum experientia tersit.

4217,CHAPTER XI,CHAPTER XI
4218,CHAPTER XI,
4219,CHAPTER XI,An affectionate exhortation to those who in early life feel themselves
4220,CHAPTER XI,disposed to become authors.
4221,CHAPTER XI,
4222,CHAPTER XI,
4223,CHAPTER XI,"It was a favourite remark of the late Mr. Whitbread’s, that no man does"
4224,CHAPTER XI,"any thing from a single motive. The separate motives, or rather moods of"
4225,CHAPTER XI,"mind, which produced the preceding reflections and anecdotes have been"
4226,CHAPTER XI,laid open to the reader in each separate instance. But an interest in
4227,CHAPTER XI,"the welfare of those, who at the present time may be in circumstances"
4228,CHAPTER XI,"not dissimilar to my own at my first entrance into life, has been"
4229,CHAPTER XI,"the constant accompaniment, and (as it were) the under-song of all"
4230,CHAPTER XI,my feelings. Whitehead exerting the prerogative of his laureateship
4231,CHAPTER XI,"addressed to youthful poets a poetic Charge, which is perhaps the"
4232,CHAPTER XI,"best, and certainly the most interesting, of his works. With no other"
4233,CHAPTER XI,"privilege than that of sympathy and sincere good wishes, I would address"
4234,CHAPTER XI,"an affectionate exhortation to the youthful literati, grounded on my"
4235,CHAPTER XI,"own experience. It will be but short; for the beginning, middle, and"
4236,CHAPTER XI,end converge to one charge: never pursue literature as a trade. With the
4237,CHAPTER XI,"exception of one extraordinary man, I have never known an individual,"
4238,CHAPTER XI,"least of all an individual of genius, healthy or happy without a"
4239,CHAPTER XI,"profession, that is, some regular employment, which does not depend on"
4240,CHAPTER XI,"the will of the moment, and which can be carried on so far mechanically"
4241,CHAPTER XI,"that an average quantum only of health, spirits, and intellectual"
4242,CHAPTER XI,exertion are requisite to its faithful discharge. Three hours of
4243,CHAPTER XI,"leisure, unannoyed by any alien anxiety, and looked forward to"
4244,CHAPTER XI,"with delight as a change and recreation, will suffice to realize in"
4245,CHAPTER XI,"literature a larger product of what is truly genial, than weeks of"
4246,CHAPTER XI,"compulsion. Money, and immediate reputation form only an arbitrary and"
4247,CHAPTER XI,accidental end of literary labour. The hope of increasing them by
4248,CHAPTER XI,any given exertion will often prove a stimulant to industry; but the
4249,CHAPTER XI,necessity of acquiring them will in all works of genius convert the
4250,CHAPTER XI,"stimulant into a narcotic. Motives by excess reverse their very nature,"
4251,CHAPTER XI,"and instead of exciting, stun and stupify the mind. For it is one"
4252,CHAPTER XI,"contradistinction of genius from talent, that its predominant end is"
4253,CHAPTER XI,"always comprised in the means; and this is one of the many points, which"
4254,CHAPTER XI,establish an analogy between genius and virtue. Now though talents may
4255,CHAPTER XI,"exist without genius, yet as genius cannot exist, certainly not manifest"
4256,CHAPTER XI,"itself, without talents, I would advise every scholar, who feels the"
4257,CHAPTER XI,"genial power working within him, so far to make a division between"
4258,CHAPTER XI,"the two, as that he should devote his talents to the acquirement of"
4259,CHAPTER XI,"competence in some known trade or profession, and his genius to objects"
4260,CHAPTER XI,of his tranquil and unbiassed choice; while the consciousness of being
4261,CHAPTER XI,"actuated in both alike by the sincere desire to perform his duty, will"
4262,CHAPTER XI,"alike ennoble both. “My dear young friend,” (I would say) “suppose"
4263,CHAPTER XI,yourself established in any honourable occupation. From the manufactory
4264,CHAPTER XI,"or counting house, from the law-court, or from having visited your last"
4265,CHAPTER XI,"patient, you return at evening,"
4266,CHAPTER XI,
4267,CHAPTER XI,"Dear tranquil time, when the sweet sense of Home"
4268,CHAPTER XI,Is sweetest------
4269,CHAPTER XI,
4270,CHAPTER XI,"to your family, prepared for its social enjoyments, with the very"
4271,CHAPTER XI,"countenances of your wife and children brightened, and their voice of"
4272,CHAPTER XI,"welcome made doubly welcome, by the knowledge that, as far as they are"
4273,CHAPTER XI,"concerned, you have satisfied the demands of the day by the labour of"
4274,CHAPTER XI,"the day. Then, when you retire into your study, in the books on"
4275,CHAPTER XI,your shelves you revisit so many venerable friends with whom you can
4276,CHAPTER XI,converse. Your own spirit scarcely less free from personal anxieties
4277,CHAPTER XI,"than the great minds, that in those books are still living for you! Even"
4278,CHAPTER XI,your writing desk with its blank paper and all its other implements will
4279,CHAPTER XI,"appear as a chain of flowers, capable of linking your feelings as well"
4280,CHAPTER XI,as thoughts to events and characters past or to come; not a chain of
4281,CHAPTER XI,"iron, which binds you down to think of the future and the remote by"
4282,CHAPTER XI,recalling the claims and feelings of the peremptory present. But why
4283,CHAPTER XI,should I say retire? The habits of active life and daily intercourse
4284,CHAPTER XI,"with the stir of the world will tend to give you such self-command, that"
4285,CHAPTER XI,"the presence of your family will be no interruption. Nay, the social"
4286,CHAPTER XI,"silence, or undisturbing voices of a wife or sister will be like a"
4287,CHAPTER XI,"restorative atmosphere, or soft music which moulds a dream without"
4288,CHAPTER XI,becoming its object. If facts are required to prove the possibility of
4289,CHAPTER XI,combining weighty performances in literature with full and independent
4290,CHAPTER XI,"employment, the works of Cicero and Xenophon among the ancients; of"
4291,CHAPTER XI,"Sir Thomas More, Bacon, Baxter, or to refer at once to later and"
4292,CHAPTER XI,"contemporary instances, Darwin and Roscoe, are at once decisive of the"
4293,CHAPTER XI,question.”
4294,CHAPTER XI,
4295,CHAPTER XI,But all men may not dare promise themselves a sufficiency of
4296,CHAPTER XI,self-control for the imitation of those examples: though strict
4297,CHAPTER XI,"scrutiny should always be made, whether indolence, restlessness, or a"
4298,CHAPTER XI,"vanity impatient for immediate gratification, have not tampered with"
4299,CHAPTER XI,the judgment and assumed the vizard of humility for the purposes of
4300,CHAPTER XI,self-delusion. Still the Church presents to every man of learning and
4301,CHAPTER XI,"genius a profession, in which he may cherish a rational hope of being"
4302,CHAPTER XI,able to unite the widest schemes of literary utility with the strictest
4303,CHAPTER XI,performance of professional duties. Among the numerous blessings of
4304,CHAPTER XI,"Christianity, the introduction of an established Church makes an"
4305,CHAPTER XI,especial claim on the gratitude of scholars and philosophers; in
4306,CHAPTER XI,"England, at least, where the principles of Protestantism have conspired"
4307,CHAPTER XI,with the freedom of the government to double all its salutary powers by
4308,CHAPTER XI,the removal of its abuses.
4309,CHAPTER XI,
4310,CHAPTER XI,"That not only the maxims, but the grounds of a pure morality, the mere"
4311,CHAPTER XI,fragments of which
4312,CHAPTER XI,
4313,CHAPTER XI,------the lofty grave tragedians taught
4314,CHAPTER XI,"In chorus or iambic, teachers best"
4315,CHAPTER XI,"Of moral prudence, with delight received"
4316,CHAPTER XI,In brief sententious precepts; [43]
4317,CHAPTER XI,
4318,CHAPTER XI,"and that the sublime truths of the divine unity and attributes, which"
4319,CHAPTER XI,a Plato found most hard to learn and deemed it still more difficult to
4320,CHAPTER XI,reveal; that these should have become the almost hereditary property of
4321,CHAPTER XI,"childhood and poverty, of the hovel and the workshop; that even to the"
4322,CHAPTER XI,"unlettered they sound as common place, is a phaenomenon, which must"
4323,CHAPTER XI,withhold all but minds of the most vulgar cast from undervaluing the
4324,CHAPTER XI,"services even of the pulpit and the reading desk. Yet those, who confine"
4325,CHAPTER XI,"the efficiency of an established Church to its public offices, can"
4326,CHAPTER XI,hardly be placed in a much higher rank of intellect. That to every
4327,CHAPTER XI,parish throughout the kingdom there is transplanted a germ of
4328,CHAPTER XI,"civilization; that in the remotest villages there is a nucleus, round"
4329,CHAPTER XI,which the capabilities of the place may crystallize and brighten;
4330,CHAPTER XI,"a model sufficiently superior to excite, yet sufficiently near to"
4331,CHAPTER XI,"encourage and facilitate, imitation; this, the unobtrusive, continuous"
4332,CHAPTER XI,"agency of a protestant church establishment, this it is, which the"
4333,CHAPTER XI,"patriot, and the philanthropist, who would fain unite the love of"
4334,CHAPTER XI,"peace with the faith in the progressive melioration of mankind, cannot"
4335,CHAPTER XI,estimate at too high a price. It cannot be valued with the gold of
4336,CHAPTER XI,"Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. No mention shall be made"
4337,CHAPTER XI,"of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies. The"
4338,CHAPTER XI,clergyman is with his parishioners and among them; he is neither in
4339,CHAPTER XI,"the cloistered cell, nor in the wilderness, but a neighbour and a"
4340,CHAPTER XI,"family-man, whose education and rank admit him to the mansion of the"
4341,CHAPTER XI,"rich landholder, while his duties make him the frequent visitor of the"
4342,CHAPTER XI,"farmhouse and the cottage. He is, or he may become, connected, with"
4343,CHAPTER XI,the families of his parish or its vicinity by marriage. And among the
4344,CHAPTER XI,"instances of the blindness, or at best of the short-sightedness, which"
4345,CHAPTER XI,"it is the nature of cupidity to inflict, I know few more striking than"
4346,CHAPTER XI,the clamours of the farmers against Church property. Whatever was not
4347,CHAPTER XI,paid to the clergyman would inevitably at the next lease be paid to the
4348,CHAPTER XI,"landholder, while, as the case at present stands, the revenues of the"
4349,CHAPTER XI,"Church are in some sort the reversionary property of every family, that"
4350,CHAPTER XI,"may have a member educated for the Church, or a daughter that may marry"
4351,CHAPTER XI,"a clergyman. Instead of being foreclosed and immovable, it is in fact"
4352,CHAPTER XI,"the only species of landed property, that is essentially moving and"
4353,CHAPTER XI,"circulative. That there exist no inconveniences, who will pretend to"
4354,CHAPTER XI,"assert? But I have yet to expect the proof, that the inconveniences are"
4355,CHAPTER XI,greater in this than in any other species; or that either the farmers
4356,CHAPTER XI,or the clergy would be benefited by forcing the latter to become either
4357,CHAPTER XI,"Trullibers or salaried placemen. Nay, I do not hesitate to declare my"
4358,CHAPTER XI,"firm persuasion, that whatever reason of discontent the farmers may"
4359,CHAPTER XI,"assign, the true cause is this; that they may cheat the parson, but"
4360,CHAPTER XI,"cannot cheat the steward; and that they are disappointed, if they should"
4361,CHAPTER XI,"have been able to withhold only two pounds less than the legal claim,"
4362,CHAPTER XI,"having expected to withhold five. At all events, considered relatively"
4363,CHAPTER XI,"to the encouragement of learning and genius, the establishment presents"
4364,CHAPTER XI,"a patronage at once so effective and unburdensome, that it would be"
4365,CHAPTER XI,impossible to afford the like or equal in any but a Christian and
4366,CHAPTER XI,Protestant country. There is scarce a department of human knowledge
4367,CHAPTER XI,"without some bearing on the various critical, historical, philosophical"
4368,CHAPTER XI,"and moral truths, in which the scholar must be interested as a"
4369,CHAPTER XI,"clergyman; no one pursuit worthy of a man of genius, which may not be"
4370,CHAPTER XI,followed without incongruity. To give the history of the Bible as a
4371,CHAPTER XI,"book, would be little less than to relate the origin or first excitement"
4372,CHAPTER XI,"of all the literature and science, that we now possess. The very"
4373,CHAPTER XI,"decorum, which the profession imposes, is favourable to the best"
4374,CHAPTER XI,"purposes of genius, and tends to counteract its most frequent defects."
4375,CHAPTER XI,"Finally, that man must be deficient in sensibility, who would not find"
4376,CHAPTER XI,"an incentive to emulation in the great and burning lights, which in a"
4377,CHAPTER XI,long series have illustrated the church of England; who would not hear
4378,CHAPTER XI,"from within an echo to the voice from their sacred shrines,"
4379,CHAPTER XI,
4380,CHAPTER XI,Et Pater Aeneas et avunculus excitat Hector.
4381,CHAPTER XI,
4382,CHAPTER XI,"But, whatever be the profession or trade chosen, the advantages are many"
4383,CHAPTER XI,"and important, compared with the state of a mere literary man, who in"
4384,CHAPTER XI,any degree depends on the sale of his works for the necessaries and
4385,CHAPTER XI,"comforts of life. In the former a man lives in sympathy with the world,"
4386,CHAPTER XI,in which he lives. At least he acquires a better and quicker tact for
4387,CHAPTER XI,"the knowledge of that, with which men in general can sympathize. He"
4388,CHAPTER XI,learns to manage his genius more prudently and efficaciously. His
4389,CHAPTER XI,powers and acquirements gain him likewise more real admiration; for they
4390,CHAPTER XI,surpass the legitimate expectations of others. He is something besides
4391,CHAPTER XI,"an author, and is not therefore considered merely as an author. The"
4392,CHAPTER XI,"hearts of men are open to him, as to one of their own class; and"
4393,CHAPTER XI,whether he exerts himself or not in the conversational circles of
4394,CHAPTER XI,"his acquaintance, his silence is not attributed to pride, nor his"
4395,CHAPTER XI,communicativeness to vanity. To these advantages I will venture to add
4396,CHAPTER XI,"a superior chance of happiness in domestic life, were it only that it is"
4397,CHAPTER XI,as natural for the man to be out of the circle of his household during
4398,CHAPTER XI,"the day, as it is meritorious for the woman to remain for the most part"
4399,CHAPTER XI,within it. But this subject involves points of consideration so numerous
4400,CHAPTER XI,"and so delicate, and would not only permit, but require such ample"
4401,CHAPTER XI,"documents from the biography of literary men, that I now merely allude"
4402,CHAPTER XI,to it in transitu. When the same circumstance has occurred at very
4403,CHAPTER XI,"different times to very different persons, all of whom have some one"
4404,CHAPTER XI,thing in common; there is reason to suppose that such circumstance is
4405,CHAPTER XI,"not merely attributable to the persons concerned, but is in some measure"
4406,CHAPTER XI,occasioned by the one point in common to them all. Instead of the
4407,CHAPTER XI,"vehement and almost slanderous dehortation from marriage, which the"
4408,CHAPTER XI,"Misogyne, Boccaccio [44] addresses to literary men, I would substitute"
4409,CHAPTER XI,the simple advice: be not merely a man of letters! Let literature be an
4410,CHAPTER XI,"honourable augmentation to your arms; but not constitute the coat, or"
4411,CHAPTER XI,fill the escutcheon!
4412,CHAPTER XI,
4413,CHAPTER XI,"To objections from conscience I can of course answer in no other way,"
4414,CHAPTER XI,than by requesting the youthful objector (as I have already done on
4415,CHAPTER XI,"a former occasion) to ascertain with strict self-examination, whether"
4416,CHAPTER XI,"other influences may not be at work; whether spirits, “not of health,”"
4417,CHAPTER XI,"and with whispers “not from heaven,” may not be walking in the twilight"
4418,CHAPTER XI,"of his consciousness. Let him catalogue his scruples, and reduce them to"
4419,CHAPTER XI,"a distinct intelligible form; let him be certain, that he has read with"
4420,CHAPTER XI,a docile mind and favourable dispositions the best and most fundamental
4421,CHAPTER XI,works on the subject; that he has had both mind and heart opened to the
4422,CHAPTER XI,"great and illustrious qualities of the many renowned characters, who"
4423,CHAPTER XI,"had doubted like himself, and whose researches had ended in the clear"
4424,CHAPTER XI,"conviction, that their doubts had been groundless, or at least in no"
4425,CHAPTER XI,"proportion to the counter-weight. Happy will it be for such a man, if"
4426,CHAPTER XI,among his contemporaries elder than himself he should meet with
4427,CHAPTER XI,"one, who, with similar powers and feelings as acute as his own,"
4428,CHAPTER XI,had entertained the same scruples; had acted upon them; and who by
4429,CHAPTER XI,"after-research (when the step was, alas! irretrievable, but for that"
4430,CHAPTER XI,very reason his research undeniably disinterested) had discovered
4431,CHAPTER XI,himself to have quarrelled with received opinions only to embrace
4432,CHAPTER XI,"errors, to have left the direction tracked out for him on the high road"
4433,CHAPTER XI,"of honourable exertion, only to deviate into a labyrinth, where when he"
4434,CHAPTER XI,"had wandered till his head was giddy, his best good fortune was finally"
4435,CHAPTER XI,"to have found his way out again, too late for prudence though not too"
4436,CHAPTER XI,late for conscience or for truth! Time spent in such delay is time
4437,CHAPTER XI,"won: for manhood in the meantime is advancing, and with it increase of"
4438,CHAPTER XI,"knowledge, strength of judgment, and above all, temperance of feelings."
4439,CHAPTER XI,"And even if these should effect no change, yet the delay will at least"
4440,CHAPTER XI,prevent the final approval of the decision from being alloyed by
4441,CHAPTER XI,"the inward censure of the rashness and vanity, by which it had been"
4442,CHAPTER XI,"precipitated. It would be a sort of irreligion, and scarcely less than"
4443,CHAPTER XI,"a libel on human nature to believe, that there is any established and"
4444,CHAPTER XI,"reputable profession or employment, in which a man may not continue to"
4445,CHAPTER XI,"act with honesty and honour; and doubtless there is likewise none, which"
4446,CHAPTER XI,may not at times present temptations to the contrary. But wofully will
4447,CHAPTER XI,"that man find himself mistaken, who imagines that the profession of"
4448,CHAPTER XI,"literature, or (to speak more plainly) the trade of authorship, besets"
4449,CHAPTER XI,"its members with fewer or with less insidious temptations, than the"
4450,CHAPTER XI,"Church, the law, or the different branches of commerce. But I have"
4451,CHAPTER XI,treated sufficiently on this unpleasant subject in an early chapter of
4452,CHAPTER XI,this volume. I will conclude the present therefore with a short extract
4453,CHAPTER XI,"from Herder, whose name I might have added to the illustrious list of"
4454,CHAPTER XI,"those, who have combined the successful pursuit of the Muses, not only"
4455,CHAPTER XI,"with the faithful discharge, but with the highest honours and honourable"
4456,CHAPTER XI,emoluments of an established profession. The translation the reader
4457,CHAPTER XI,"will find in a note below [45]. “Am sorgfaeltigsten, meiden sie die"

4469,CHAPTER XII,
4470,CHAPTER XII,A chapter of requests and premonitions concerning the perusal or
4471,CHAPTER XII,omission of the chapter that follows.
4472,CHAPTER XII,
4473,CHAPTER XII,
4474,CHAPTER XII,In the perusal of philosophical works I have been greatly benefited by
4475,CHAPTER XII,"a resolve, which, in the antithetic form and with the allowed quaintness"
4476,CHAPTER XII,"of an adage or maxim, I have been accustomed to word thus: until you"
4477,CHAPTER XII,"understand a writer’s ignorance, presume yourself ignorant of his"
4478,CHAPTER XII,"understanding. This golden rule of mine does, I own, resemble those of"
4479,CHAPTER XII,Pythagoras in its obscurity rather than in its depth. If however the
4480,CHAPTER XII,"reader will permit me to be my own Hierocles, I trust, that he will"
4481,CHAPTER XII,find its meaning fully explained by the following instances. I have
4482,CHAPTER XII,"now before me a treatise of a religious fanatic, full of dreams and"
4483,CHAPTER XII,"supernatural experiences. I see clearly the writer’s grounds, and their"
4484,CHAPTER XII,"hollowness. I have a complete insight into the causes, which through the"
4485,CHAPTER XII,medium of his body has acted on his mind; and by application of received
4486,CHAPTER XII,and ascertained laws I can satisfactorily explain to my own reason all
4487,CHAPTER XII,"the strange incidents, which the writer records of himself. And this I"
4488,CHAPTER XII,can do without suspecting him of any intentional falsehood. As when in
4489,CHAPTER XII,"broad day-light a man tracks the steps of a traveller, who had lost his"
4490,CHAPTER XII,"way in a fog or by a treacherous moonshine, even so, and with the same"
4491,CHAPTER XII,"tranquil sense of certainty, can I follow the traces of this bewildered"
4492,CHAPTER XII,visionary. I understand his ignorance.
4493,CHAPTER XII,
4494,CHAPTER XII,"On the other hand, I have been re-perusing with the best energies of my"
4495,CHAPTER XII,"mind the TIMAEUS of Plato. Whatever I comprehend, impresses me with a"
4496,CHAPTER XII,reverential sense of the author’s genius; but there is a considerable
4497,CHAPTER XII,"portion of the work, to which I can attach no consistent meaning."
4498,CHAPTER XII,"In other treatises of the same philosopher, intended for the average"
4499,CHAPTER XII,"comprehensions of men, I have been delighted with the masterly good"
4500,CHAPTER XII,"sense, with the perspicuity of the language, and the aptness of the"
4501,CHAPTER XII,"inductions. I recollect likewise, that numerous passages in this author,"
4502,CHAPTER XII,"which I thoroughly comprehend, were formerly no less unintelligible to"
4503,CHAPTER XII,"me, than the passages now in question. It would, I am aware, be quite"
4504,CHAPTER XII,fashionable to dismiss them at once as Platonic jargon. But this I
4505,CHAPTER XII,"cannot do with satisfaction to my own mind, because I have sought in"
4506,CHAPTER XII,vain for causes adequate to the solution of the assumed inconsistency.
4507,CHAPTER XII,"I have no insight into the possibility of a man so eminently wise, using"
4508,CHAPTER XII,"words with such half-meanings to himself, as must perforce pass into no"
4509,CHAPTER XII,meaning to his readers. When in addition to the motives thus suggested
4510,CHAPTER XII,"by my own reason, I bring into distinct remembrance the number and the"
4511,CHAPTER XII,"series of great men, who, after long and zealous study of these works"
4512,CHAPTER XII,"had joined in honouring the name of Plato with epithets, that almost"
4513,CHAPTER XII,"transcend humanity, I feel, that a contemptuous verdict on my part might"
4514,CHAPTER XII,"argue want of modesty, but would hardly be received by the judicious, as"
4515,CHAPTER XII,"evidence of superior penetration. Therefore, utterly baffled in all"
4516,CHAPTER XII,"my attempts to understand the ignorance of Plato, I conclude myself"
4517,CHAPTER XII,ignorant of his understanding.
4518,CHAPTER XII,
4519,CHAPTER XII,In lieu of the various requests which the anxiety of authorship
4520,CHAPTER XII,"addresses to the unknown reader, I advance but this one; that he will"
4521,CHAPTER XII,"either pass over the following chapter altogether, or read the whole"
4522,CHAPTER XII,connectedly. The fairest part of the most beautiful body will appear
4523,CHAPTER XII,"deformed and monstrous, if dissevered from its place in the organic"
4524,CHAPTER XII,"whole. Nay, on delicate subjects, where a seemingly trifling difference"
4525,CHAPTER XII,"of more or less may constitute a difference in kind, even a faithful"
4526,CHAPTER XII,"display of the main and supporting ideas, if yet they are separated from"
4527,CHAPTER XII,"the forms by which they are at once clothed and modified, may perchance"
4528,CHAPTER XII,present a skeleton indeed; but a skeleton to alarm and deter. Though I
4529,CHAPTER XII,"might find numerous precedents, I shall not desire the reader to strip"
4530,CHAPTER XII,"his mind of all prejudices, nor to keep all prior systems out of view"
4531,CHAPTER XII,"during his examination of the present. For in truth, such requests"
4532,CHAPTER XII,appear to me not much unlike the advice given to hypochondriacal
4533,CHAPTER XII,"patients in Dr. Buchan’s domestic medicine; videlicet, to preserve"
4534,CHAPTER XII,themselves uniformly tranquil and in good spirits. Till I had discovered
4535,CHAPTER XII,"the art of destroying the memory a parte post, without injury to its"
4536,CHAPTER XII,"future operations, and without detriment to the judgment, I should"
4537,CHAPTER XII,"suppress the request as premature; and therefore, however much I may"
4538,CHAPTER XII,"wish to be read with an unprejudiced mind, I do not presume to state it"
4539,CHAPTER XII,as a necessary condition.
4540,CHAPTER XII,
4541,CHAPTER XII,"The extent of my daring is to suggest one criterion, by which it may be"
4542,CHAPTER XII,"rationally conjectured beforehand, whether or no a reader would lose"
4543,CHAPTER XII,"his time, and perhaps his temper, in the perusal of this, or any other"
4544,CHAPTER XII,treatise constructed on similar principles. But it would be cruelly
4545,CHAPTER XII,"misinterpreted, as implying the least disrespect either for the moral"
4546,CHAPTER XII,or intellectual qualities of the individuals thereby precluded. The
4547,CHAPTER XII,"criterion is this: if a man receives as fundamental facts, and therefore"
4548,CHAPTER XII,"of course indemonstrable and incapable of further analysis, the general"
4549,CHAPTER XII,"notions of matter, spirit, soul, body, action, passiveness, time, space,"
4550,CHAPTER XII,"cause and effect, consciousness, perception, memory and habit; if"
4551,CHAPTER XII,"he feels his mind completely at rest concerning all these, and is"
4552,CHAPTER XII,"satisfied, if only he can analyse all other notions into some one or"
4553,CHAPTER XII,more of these supposed elements with plausible subordination and apt
4554,CHAPTER XII,arrangement: to such a mind I would as courteously as possible convey
4555,CHAPTER XII,"the hint, that for him the chapter was not written."
4556,CHAPTER XII,
4557,CHAPTER XII,"Vir bonus es, doctus, prudens; ast haud tibi spiro."
4558,CHAPTER XII,
4559,CHAPTER XII,"For these terms do in truth include all the difficulties, which the"
4560,CHAPTER XII,"human mind can propose for solution. Taking them therefore in mass, and"
4561,CHAPTER XII,"unexamined, it required only a decent apprenticeship in logic, to draw"
4562,CHAPTER XII,"forth their contents in all forms and colours, as the professors of"
4563,CHAPTER XII,legerdemain at our village fairs pull out ribbon after ribbon from their
4564,CHAPTER XII,mouths. And not more difficult is it to reduce them back again to their
4565,CHAPTER XII,different genera. But though this analysis is highly useful in rendering
4566,CHAPTER XII,"our knowledge more distinct, it does not really add to it. It does not"
4567,CHAPTER XII,"increase, though it gives us a greater mastery over, the wealth which"
4568,CHAPTER XII,"we before possessed. For forensic purposes, for all the established"
4569,CHAPTER XII,"professions of society, this is sufficient. But for philosophy in its"
4570,CHAPTER XII,"highest sense as the science of ultimate truths, and therefore scientia"
4571,CHAPTER XII,"scientiarum, this mere analysis of terms is preparative only, though as"
4572,CHAPTER XII,a preparative discipline indispensable.
4573,CHAPTER XII,
4574,CHAPTER XII,Still less dare a favourable perusal be anticipated from the proselytes
4575,CHAPTER XII,"of that compendious philosophy, which talking of mind but thinking"
4576,CHAPTER XII,"of brick and mortar, or other images equally abstracted from body,"
4577,CHAPTER XII,"contrives a theory of spirit by nicknaming matter, and in a few hours"
4578,CHAPTER XII,can qualify its dullest disciples to explain the omne scibile by
4579,CHAPTER XII,"reducing all things to impressions, ideas, and sensations."
4580,CHAPTER XII,
4581,CHAPTER XII,But it is time to tell the truth; though it requires some courage to
4582,CHAPTER XII,"avow it in an age and country, in which disquisitions on all subjects,"
4583,CHAPTER XII,"not privileged to adopt technical terms or scientific symbols, must be"
4584,CHAPTER XII,"addressed to the Public. I say then, that it is neither possible nor"
4585,CHAPTER XII,"necessary for all men, nor for many, to be philosophers. There is a"
4586,CHAPTER XII,"philosophic (and inasmuch as it is actualized by an effort of freedom,"
4587,CHAPTER XII,"an artificial) consciousness, which lies beneath or (as it were) behind"
4588,CHAPTER XII,the spontaneous consciousness natural to all reflecting beings. As the
4589,CHAPTER XII,elder Romans distinguished their northern provinces into Cis-Alpine and
4590,CHAPTER XII,"Trans-Alpine, so may we divide all the objects of human knowledge into"
4591,CHAPTER XII,"those on this side, and those on the other side of the spontaneous"
4592,CHAPTER XII,consciousness; citra et trans conscientiam communem. The latter is
4593,CHAPTER XII,"exclusively the domain of pure philosophy, which is therefore properly"
4594,CHAPTER XII,"entitled transcendental, in order to discriminate it at once, both from"
4595,CHAPTER XII,"mere reflection and representation on the one hand, and on the other"
4596,CHAPTER XII,"from those flights of lawless speculation which, abandoned by all"
4597,CHAPTER XII,"distinct consciousness, because transgressing the bounds and purposes of"
4598,CHAPTER XII,"our intellectual faculties, are justly condemned, as transcendent [46]."
4599,CHAPTER XII,"The first range of hills, that encircles the scanty vale of human life,"
4600,CHAPTER XII,is the horizon for the majority of its inhabitants. On its ridges the
4601,CHAPTER XII,"common sun is born and departs. From them the stars rise, and touching"
4602,CHAPTER XII,"them they vanish. By the many, even this range, the natural limit and"
4603,CHAPTER XII,"bulwark of the vale, is but imperfectly known. Its higher ascents are"
4604,CHAPTER XII,"too often hidden by mists and clouds from uncultivated swamps, which"
4605,CHAPTER XII,few have courage or curiosity to penetrate. To the multitude below these
4606,CHAPTER XII,"vapours appear, now as the dark haunts of terrific agents, on which none"
4607,CHAPTER XII,"may intrude with impunity; and now all aglow, with colours not their"
4608,CHAPTER XII,"own, they are gazed at as the splendid palaces of happiness and power."
4609,CHAPTER XII,"But in all ages there have been a few, who measuring and sounding the"
4610,CHAPTER XII,rivers of the vale at the feet of their furthest inaccessible falls have
4611,CHAPTER XII,"learned, that the sources must be far higher and far inward; a few, who"
4612,CHAPTER XII,"even in the level streams have detected elements, which neither the vale"
4613,CHAPTER XII,itself nor the surrounding mountains contained or could supply [47].
4614,CHAPTER XII,"How and whence to these thoughts, these strong probabilities, the"
4615,CHAPTER XII,"ascertaining vision, the intuitive knowledge may finally supervene, can"
4616,CHAPTER XII,be learnt only by the fact. I might oppose to the question the words
4617,CHAPTER XII,with which [48] Plotinus supposes Nature to answer a similar difficulty.
4618,CHAPTER XII,"“Should any one interrogate her, how she works, if graciously she"
4619,CHAPTER XII,"vouchsafe to listen and speak, she will reply, it behoves thee not to"
4620,CHAPTER XII,"disquiet me with interrogatories, but to understand in silence, even as"
4621,CHAPTER XII,"I am silent, and work without words.”"
4622,CHAPTER XII,
4623,CHAPTER XII,"Likewise in the fifth book of the fifth Ennead, speaking of the highest"
4624,CHAPTER XII,"and intuitive knowledge as distinguished from the discursive, or in the"
4625,CHAPTER XII,"language of Wordsworth,"
4626,CHAPTER XII,
4627,CHAPTER XII,“The vision and the faculty divine;”
4628,CHAPTER XII,
4629,CHAPTER XII,"he says: “it is not lawful to inquire from whence it sprang, as if it"
4630,CHAPTER XII,"were a thing subject to place and motion, for it neither approached"
4631,CHAPTER XII,"hither, nor again departs from hence to some other place; but it either"
4632,CHAPTER XII,appears to us or it does not appear. So that we ought not to pursue it
4633,CHAPTER XII,"with a view of detecting its secret source, but to watch in quiet"
4634,CHAPTER XII,till it suddenly shines upon us; preparing ourselves for the blessed
4635,CHAPTER XII,spectacle as the eye waits patiently for the rising sun.” They and
4636,CHAPTER XII,"they only can acquire the philosophic imagination, the sacred power of"
4637,CHAPTER XII,"self-intuition, who within themselves can interpret and understand the"
4638,CHAPTER XII,"symbol, that the wings of the air-sylph are forming within the skin"
4639,CHAPTER XII,"of the caterpillar; those only, who feel in their own spirits the same"
4640,CHAPTER XII,"instinct, which impels the chrysalis of the horned fly to leave room in"
4641,CHAPTER XII,"its involucrum for antenna, yet to come. They know and feel, that the"
4642,CHAPTER XII,"potential works in them, even as the actual works on them! In short, all"
4643,CHAPTER XII,the organs of sense are framed for a corresponding world of sense; and
4644,CHAPTER XII,we have it. All the organs of spirit are framed for a correspondent
4645,CHAPTER XII,world of spirit: though the latter organs are not developed in all
4646,CHAPTER XII,"alike. But they exist in all, and their first appearance discloses"
4647,CHAPTER XII,"itself in the moral being. How else could it be, that even worldlings,"
4648,CHAPTER XII,"not wholly debased, will contemplate the man of simple and disinterested"
4649,CHAPTER XII,goodness with contradictory feelings of pity and respect? “Poor man!
4650,CHAPTER XII,he is not made for this world.” Oh! herein they utter a prophecy of
4651,CHAPTER XII,universal fulfilment; for man must either rise or sink.
4652,CHAPTER XII,
4653,CHAPTER XII,It is the essential mark of the true philosopher to rest satisfied with
4654,CHAPTER XII,"no imperfect light, as long as the impossibility of attaining a fuller"
4655,CHAPTER XII,knowledge has not been demonstrated. That the common consciousness
4656,CHAPTER XII,"itself will furnish proofs by its own direction, that it is connected"
4657,CHAPTER XII,"with master-currents below the surface, I shall merely assume as"
4658,CHAPTER XII,"a postulate pro tempore. This having been granted, though but in"
4659,CHAPTER XII,"expectation of the argument, I can safely deduce from it the equal truth"
4660,CHAPTER XII,"of my former assertion, that philosophy cannot be intelligible to all,"
4661,CHAPTER XII,"even of the most learned and cultivated classes. A system, the first"
4662,CHAPTER XII,principle of which it is to render the mind intuitive of the spiritual
4663,CHAPTER XII,in man (i.e. of that which lies on the other side of our natural
4664,CHAPTER XII,"consciousness) must needs have a great obscurity for those, who have"
4665,CHAPTER XII,never disciplined and strengthened this ulterior consciousness. It must
4666,CHAPTER XII,"in truth be a land of darkness, a perfect Anti-Goshen, for men to whom"
4667,CHAPTER XII,the noblest treasures of their own being are reported only through the
4668,CHAPTER XII,"imperfect translation of lifeless and sightless motions. Perhaps, in"
4669,CHAPTER XII,"great part, through words which are but the shadows of notions; even"
4670,CHAPTER XII,as the notional understanding itself is but the shadowy abstraction of
4671,CHAPTER XII,"living and actual truth. On the IMMEDIATE, which dwells in every man,"
4672,CHAPTER XII,"and on the original intuition, or absolute affirmation of it, (which"
4673,CHAPTER XII,"is likewise in every man, but does not in every man rise into"
4674,CHAPTER XII,consciousness) all the certainty of our knowledge depends; and this
4675,CHAPTER XII,becomes intelligible to no man by the ministry of mere words from
4676,CHAPTER XII,"without. The medium, by which spirits understand each other, is not the"
4677,CHAPTER XII,"surrounding air; but the freedom which they possess in common, as the"
4678,CHAPTER XII,"common ethereal element of their being, the tremulous reciprocations"
4679,CHAPTER XII,of which propagate themselves even to the inmost of the soul. Where the
4680,CHAPTER XII,spirit of a man is not filled with the consciousness of freedom (were it
4681,CHAPTER XII,"only from its restlessness, as of one still struggling in bondage) all"
4682,CHAPTER XII,"spiritual intercourse is interrupted, not only with others, but even"
4683,CHAPTER XII,"with himself. No wonder then, that he remains incomprehensible to"
4684,CHAPTER XII,"himself as well as to others. No wonder, that, in the fearful desert of"
4685,CHAPTER XII,"his consciousness, he wearies himself out with empty words, to which"
4686,CHAPTER XII,"no friendly echo answers, either from his own heart, or the heart of a"
4687,CHAPTER XII,"fellow being; or bewilders himself in the pursuit of notional phantoms,"
4688,CHAPTER XII,the mere refractions from unseen and distant truths through the
4689,CHAPTER XII,distorting medium of his own unenlivened and stagnant understanding!
4690,CHAPTER XII,"To remain unintelligible to such a mind, exclaims Schelling on a like"
4691,CHAPTER XII,"occasion, is honour and a good name before God and man."
4692,CHAPTER XII,
4693,CHAPTER XII,The history of philosophy (the same writer observes) contains instances
4694,CHAPTER XII,"of systems, which for successive generations have remained enigmatic."
4695,CHAPTER XII,"Such he deems the system of Leibnitz, whom another writer (rashly I"
4696,CHAPTER XII,"think, and invidiously) extols as the only philosopher, who was himself"
4697,CHAPTER XII,"deeply convinced of his own doctrines. As hitherto interpreted, however,"
4698,CHAPTER XII,"they have not produced the effect, which Leibnitz himself, in a most"
4699,CHAPTER XII,"instructive passage, describes as the criterion of a true philosophy;"
4700,CHAPTER XII,"namely, that it would at once explain and collect the fragments of truth"
4701,CHAPTER XII,"scattered through systems apparently the most incongruous. The truth,"
4702,CHAPTER XII,"says he, is diffused more widely than is commonly believed; but it"
4703,CHAPTER XII,"is often painted, yet oftener masked, and is sometimes mutilated and"
4704,CHAPTER XII,"sometimes, alas! in close alliance with mischievous errors. The deeper,"
4705,CHAPTER XII,"however, we penetrate into the ground of things, the more truth we"
4706,CHAPTER XII,discover in the doctrines of the greater number of the philosophical
4707,CHAPTER XII,"sects. The want of substantial reality in the objects of the senses,"
4708,CHAPTER XII,"according to the sceptics; the harmonies or numbers, the prototypes and"
4709,CHAPTER XII,"ideas, to which the Pythagoreans and Platonists reduced all things:"
4710,CHAPTER XII,"the ONE and ALL of Parmenides and Plotinus, without [49] Spinozism; the"
4711,CHAPTER XII,"necessary connection of things according to the Stoics, reconcilable"
4712,CHAPTER XII,with the spontaneity of the other schools; the vital-philosophy of the
4713,CHAPTER XII,"Cabalists and Hermetists, who assumed the universality of sensation;"
4714,CHAPTER XII,"the substantial forms and entelechies of Aristotle and the schoolmen,"
4715,CHAPTER XII,together with the mechanical solution of all particular phaenomena
4716,CHAPTER XII,according to Democritus and the recent philosophers--all these we shall
4717,CHAPTER XII,"find united in one perspective central point, which shows regularity"
4718,CHAPTER XII,"and a coincidence of all the parts in the very object, which from every"
4719,CHAPTER XII,other point of view must appear confused and distorted. The spirit of
4720,CHAPTER XII,"sectarianism has been hitherto our fault, and the cause of our failures."
4721,CHAPTER XII,"We have imprisoned our own conceptions by the lines, which we have"
4722,CHAPTER XII,"drawn, in order to exclude the conceptions of others. J’ai trouve que"
4723,CHAPTER XII,la plupart des Sectes ont raison dans une bonne partie de ce qu’elles
4724,CHAPTER XII,"avancent, mais non pas tant en ce qu’elles nient."
4725,CHAPTER XII,
4726,CHAPTER XII,"A system, which aims to deduce the memory with all the other functions"
4727,CHAPTER XII,"of intelligence, must of course place its first position from beyond the"
4728,CHAPTER XII,"memory, and anterior to it, otherwise the principle of solution would"
4729,CHAPTER XII,be itself a part of the problem to be solved. Such a position therefore
4730,CHAPTER XII,"must, in the first instance be demanded, and the first question will be,"
4731,CHAPTER XII,by what right is it demanded? On this account I think it expedient
4732,CHAPTER XII,to make some preliminary remarks on the introduction of Postulates
4733,CHAPTER XII,in philosophy. The word postulate is borrowed from the science
4734,CHAPTER XII,of mathematics [50]. In geometry the primary construction is not
4735,CHAPTER XII,"demonstrated, but postulated. This first and most simple construction in"
4736,CHAPTER XII,"space is the point in motion, or the line. Whether the point is moved"
4737,CHAPTER XII,"in one and the same direction, or whether its direction is continually"
4738,CHAPTER XII,"changed, remains as yet undetermined. But if the direction of the point"
4739,CHAPTER XII,"have been determined, it is either by a point without it, and then there"
4740,CHAPTER XII,arises the straight line which incloses no space; or the direction of
4741,CHAPTER XII,"the point is not determined by a point without it, and then it must flow"
4742,CHAPTER XII,"back again on itself, that is, there arises a cyclical line, which does"
4743,CHAPTER XII,"enclose a space. If the straight line be assumed as the positive, the"
4744,CHAPTER XII,"cyclical is then the negation of the straight. It is a line, which at"
4745,CHAPTER XII,"no point strikes out into the straight, but changes its direction"
4746,CHAPTER XII,"continuously. But if the primary line be conceived as undetermined, and"
4747,CHAPTER XII,"the straight line as determined throughout, then the cyclical is the"
4748,CHAPTER XII,third compounded of both. It is at once undetermined and determined;
4749,CHAPTER XII,"undetermined through any point without, and determined through itself."
4750,CHAPTER XII,Geometry therefore supplies philosophy with the example of a primary
4751,CHAPTER XII,"intuition, from which every science that lays claim to evidence"
4752,CHAPTER XII,must take its commencement. The mathematician does not begin with a
4753,CHAPTER XII,"demonstrable proposition, but with an intuition, a practical idea."
4754,CHAPTER XII,
4755,CHAPTER XII,But here an important distinction presents itself. Philosophy is
4756,CHAPTER XII,"employed on objects of the inner SENSE, and cannot, like geometry,"
4757,CHAPTER XII,appropriate to every construction a correspondent outward intuition.
4758,CHAPTER XII,"Nevertheless, philosophy, if it is to arrive at evidence, must proceed"
4759,CHAPTER XII,"from the most original construction, and the question then is, what is"
4760,CHAPTER XII,the most original construction or first productive act for the inner
4761,CHAPTER XII,sense. The answer to this question depends on the direction which is
4762,CHAPTER XII,given to the inner sense. But in philosophy the inner sense cannot
4763,CHAPTER XII,have its direction determined by an outward object. To the original
4764,CHAPTER XII,construction of the line I can be compelled by a line drawn before me
4765,CHAPTER XII,on the slate or on sand. The stroke thus drawn is indeed not the line
4766,CHAPTER XII,"itself, but only the image or picture of the line. It is not from it,"
4767,CHAPTER XII,"that we first learn to know the line; but, on the contrary, we"
4768,CHAPTER XII,bring this stroke to the original line generated by the act of the
4769,CHAPTER XII,imagination; otherwise we could not define it as without breadth or
4770,CHAPTER XII,thickness. Still however this stroke is the sensuous image of
4771,CHAPTER XII,"the original or ideal line, and an efficient mean to excite every"
4772,CHAPTER XII,imagination to the intuition of it.
4773,CHAPTER XII,
4774,CHAPTER XII,"It is demanded then, whether there be found any means in philosophy"
4775,CHAPTER XII,"to determine the direction of the inner sense, as in mathematics it is"
4776,CHAPTER XII,determinable by its specific image or outward picture. Now the inner
4777,CHAPTER XII,sense has its direction determined for the greater part only by an act
4778,CHAPTER XII,of freedom. One man’s consciousness extends only to the pleasant or
4779,CHAPTER XII,unpleasant sensations caused in him by external impressions; another
4780,CHAPTER XII,enlarges his inner sense to a consciousness of forms and quantity; a
4781,CHAPTER XII,third in addition to the image is conscious of the conception or notion
4782,CHAPTER XII,of the thing; a fourth attains to a notion of his notions--he reflects
4783,CHAPTER XII,"on his own reflections; and thus we may say without impropriety, that"
4784,CHAPTER XII,"the one possesses more or less inner sense, than the other. This more or"
4785,CHAPTER XII,"less betrays already, that philosophy in its first principles must have"
4786,CHAPTER XII,"a practical or moral, as well as a theoretical or speculative side."
4787,CHAPTER XII,This difference in degree does not exist in the mathematics. Socrates in
4788,CHAPTER XII,"Plato shows, that an ignorant slave may be brought to understand and of"
4789,CHAPTER XII,himself to solve the most difficult geometrical problem. Socrates drew
4790,CHAPTER XII,the figures for the slave in the sand. The disciples of the critical
4791,CHAPTER XII,philosophy could likewise (as was indeed actually done by La Forge
4792,CHAPTER XII,and some other followers of Des Cartes) represent the origin of our
4793,CHAPTER XII,"representations in copper-plates; but no one has yet attempted it, and"
4794,CHAPTER XII,it would be utterly useless. To an Esquimaux or New Zealander our most
4795,CHAPTER XII,"popular philosophy would be wholly unintelligible. The sense, the inward"
4796,CHAPTER XII,"organ, for it is not yet born in him. So is there many a one among"
4797,CHAPTER XII,"us, yes, and some who think themselves philosophers too, to whom the"
4798,CHAPTER XII,philosophic organ is entirely wanting. To such a man philosophy is a
4799,CHAPTER XII,"mere play of words and notions, like a theory of music to the deaf, or"
4800,CHAPTER XII,like the geometry of light to the blind. The connection of the parts and
4801,CHAPTER XII,their logical dependencies may be seen and remembered; but the whole is
4802,CHAPTER XII,"groundless and hollow, unsustained by living contact, unaccompanied with"
4803,CHAPTER XII,any realizing intuition which exists by and in the act that affirms its
4804,CHAPTER XII,"existence, which is known, because it is, and is, because it is known."
4805,CHAPTER XII,"The words of Plotinus, in the assumed person of Nature, hold true of the"
4806,CHAPTER XII,"philosophic energy. To theoroun mou, theoraema poiei, osper oi geometrai"
4807,CHAPTER XII,"theorountes graphousin; all’ emon mae graphousaes, theorousaes de,"
4808,CHAPTER XII,uphistantai ai ton somaton grammai. With me the act of contemplation
4809,CHAPTER XII,"makes the thing contemplated, as the geometricians contemplating"
4810,CHAPTER XII,"describe lines correspondent; but I not describing lines, but simply"
4811,CHAPTER XII,"contemplating, the representative forms of things rise up into"
4812,CHAPTER XII,existence.
4813,CHAPTER XII,
4814,CHAPTER XII,The postulate of philosophy and at the same time the test of philosophic
4815,CHAPTER XII,"capacity, is no other than the heaven-descended KNOW THYSELF! (E"
4816,CHAPTER XII,"coelo descendit, Gnothi seauton). And this at once practically and"
4817,CHAPTER XII,speculatively. For as philosophy is neither a science of the reason or
4818,CHAPTER XII,"understanding only, nor merely a science of morals, but the science of"
4819,CHAPTER XII,"BEING altogether, its primary ground can be neither merely speculative"
4820,CHAPTER XII,"nor merely practical, but both in one. All knowledge rests on the"
4821,CHAPTER XII,coincidence of an object with a subject. (My readers have been warned
4822,CHAPTER XII,"in a former chapter that, for their convenience as well as the writer’s,"
4823,CHAPTER XII,"the term, subject, is used by me in its scholastic sense as equivalent"
4824,CHAPTER XII,"to mind or sentient being, and as the necessary correlative of object or"
4825,CHAPTER XII,quicquid objicitur menti.) For we can know that only which is true: and
4826,CHAPTER XII,the truth is universally placed in the coincidence of the thought with
4827,CHAPTER XII,"the thing, of the representation with the object represented."
4828,CHAPTER XII,
4829,CHAPTER XII,"Now the sum of all that is merely OBJECTIVE, we will henceforth call"
4830,CHAPTER XII,"NATURE, confining the term to its passive and material sense, as"
4831,CHAPTER XII,comprising all the phaenomena by which its existence is made known
4832,CHAPTER XII,"to us. On the other hand the sum of all that is SUBJECTIVE, we may"
4833,CHAPTER XII,comprehend in the name of the SELF or INTELLIGENCE. Both conceptions
4834,CHAPTER XII,are in necessary antithesis. Intelligence is conceived of as exclusively
4835,CHAPTER XII,"representative, nature as exclusively represented; the one as conscious,"
4836,CHAPTER XII,the other as without consciousness. Now in all acts of positive
4837,CHAPTER XII,"knowledge there is required a reciprocal concurrence of both, namely"
4838,CHAPTER XII,"of the conscious being, and of that which is in itself unconscious."
4839,CHAPTER XII,"Our problem is to explain this concurrence, its possibility and its"
4840,CHAPTER XII,necessity.
4841,CHAPTER XII,
4842,CHAPTER XII,"During the act of knowledge itself, the objective and subjective are"
4843,CHAPTER XII,"so instantly united, that we cannot determine to which of the two"
4844,CHAPTER XII,"the priority belongs. There is here no first, and no second; both are"
4845,CHAPTER XII,coinstantaneous and one. While I am attempting to explain this intimate
4846,CHAPTER XII,"coalition, I must suppose it dissolved. I must necessarily set out from"
4847,CHAPTER XII,"the one, to which therefore I give hypothetical antecedence, in order to"
4848,CHAPTER XII,arrive at the other. But as there are but two factors or elements in the
4849,CHAPTER XII,"problem, subject and object, and as it is left indeterminate from which"
4850,CHAPTER XII,"of them I should commence, there are two cases equally possible."

4868,"ACCOUNT FOR THE SUPERVENTION OF THE SUBJECTIVE, WHICH COALESCES WITH IT.","is founded in nature. For if all knowledge has, as it were, two poles"

4872,"ACCOUNT FOR THE SUPERVENTION OF THE SUBJECTIVE, WHICH COALESCES WITH IT.",necessary tendency therefore of all natural philosophy is from nature to

4972,THERE SUPERVENES TO IT A COINCIDENT OBJECTIVE.,realism of mankind properly consist? In the assertion that there exists
4973,THERE SUPERVENES TO IT A COINCIDENT OBJECTIVE.,"a something without them, what, or how, or where they know not, which"
4974,THERE SUPERVENES TO IT A COINCIDENT OBJECTIVE.,occasions the objects of their perception? Oh no! This is neither
4975,THERE SUPERVENES TO IT A COINCIDENT OBJECTIVE.,connatural nor universal. It is what a few have taught and learned
4976,THERE SUPERVENES TO IT A COINCIDENT OBJECTIVE.,"in the schools, and which the many repeat without asking themselves"
4977,THERE SUPERVENES TO IT A COINCIDENT OBJECTIVE.,concerning their own meaning. The realism common to all mankind is far
4978,THERE SUPERVENES TO IT A COINCIDENT OBJECTIVE.,elder and lies infinitely deeper than this hypothetical explanation
4979,THERE SUPERVENES TO IT A COINCIDENT OBJECTIVE.,"of the origin of our perceptions, an explanation skimmed from the mere"

4982,THERE SUPERVENES TO IT A COINCIDENT OBJECTIVE.,"from which he may argumentatively deduce the reality of a table, which"

4985,THERE SUPERVENES TO IT A COINCIDENT OBJECTIVE.,"modern metaphysics, which banishes us to a land of shadows, surrounds"
4986,THERE SUPERVENES TO IT A COINCIDENT OBJECTIVE.,"us with apparitions, and distinguishes truth from illusion only by the"
4987,THERE SUPERVENES TO IT A COINCIDENT OBJECTIVE.,majority of those who dream the same dream? “I asserted that the world

5047,THESIS II,"act of the imagination, which, instinctively and without our noticing"

5076,THESIS IV,"a circle that it is equi-radial, the predicate indeed is implied in the"
5077,THESIS IV,definition of the subject; but the existence of the subject itself
5078,THESIS IV,"is contingent, and supposes both a cause and a percipient. The same"
5079,THESIS IV,reasoning will apply to the indefinite number of supposed indemonstrable

5091,THESIS V,"thing, is no less a contradiction, than an infinite circle or a sideless"

5100,THESIS V,"nor subject taken separately, and consequently, as no other third is"

5109,THESIS VI,"object and subject, being and knowing, are identical, each involving"

5112,THESIS VI,"which never is an object except for itself, and only so far as by the"
5113,THESIS VI,very same act it becomes a subject. It may be described therefore as

5117,THESIS VI,"SCHOLIUM. If a man be asked how he knows that he is? he can only answer,"

5119,THESIS VI,"admitted) he be again asked, how he, the individual person, came to be,"
5120,THESIS VI,"then in relation to the ground of his existence, not to the ground of"
5121,THESIS VI,"his knowledge of that existence, he might reply, sum quia Deus est, or"

5123,THESIS VI,
5124,THESIS VI,"But if we elevate our conception to the absolute self, the great eternal"

5134,THESIS VII,Only in the self-consciousness of a spirit is there the required
5135,THESIS VII,identity of object and of representation; for herein consists the
5136,THESIS VII,"essence of a spirit, that it is self-representative. If therefore this"
5137,THESIS VII,"be the one only immediate truth, in the certainty of which the reality"
5138,THESIS VII,"of our collective knowledge is grounded, it must follow that the spirit"
5139,THESIS VII,"in all the objects which it views, views only itself. If this could"
5140,THESIS VII,"be proved, the immediate reality of all intuitive knowledge would be"
5141,THESIS VII,"assured. It has been shown, that a spirit is that, which is its own"
5142,THESIS VII,"object, yet not originally an object, but an absolute subject for which"
5143,THESIS VII,"all, itself included, may become an object. It must therefore be an ACT;"
5144,THESIS VII,"for every object is, as an object, dead, fixed, incapable in itself of"
5145,THESIS VII,"any action, and necessarily finite. Again the spirit (originally"
5146,THESIS VII,the identity of object and subject) must in some sense dissolve this
5147,THESIS VII,"identity, in order to be conscious of it; fit alter et idem. But"
5148,THESIS VII,"this implies an act, and it follows therefore that intelligence"
5149,THESIS VII,"or self-consciousness is impossible, except by and in a will. The"
5150,THESIS VII,self-conscious spirit therefore is a will; and freedom must be assumed
5151,THESIS VII,"as a ground of philosophy, and can never be deduced from it."

5154,THESIS VIII,
5155,THESIS VIII,"Whatever in its origin is objective, is likewise as such necessarily"

5157,THESIS VIII,"as the subject exists in antithesis to an object, the spirit cannot"
5158,THESIS VIII,originally be finite. But neither can it be a subject without becoming
5159,THESIS VIII,"an object, and, as it is originally the identity of both, it can be"
5160,THESIS VIII,"conceived neither as infinite nor finite exclusively, but as the most"
5161,THESIS VIII,"original union of both. In the existence, in the reconciling, and the"
5162,THESIS VIII,recurrence of this contradiction consists the process and mystery of
5163,THESIS VIII,production and life.

5166,THESIS IX,
5167,THESIS IX,"This principium commune essendi et cognoscendi, as subsisting in a WILL,"
5168,THESIS IX,"or primary ACT of self-duplication, is the mediate or indirect principle"
5169,THESIS IX,of every science; but it is the immediate and direct principle of the
5170,THESIS IX,"ultimate science alone, i.e. of transcendental philosophy alone. For it"
5171,THESIS IX,"must be remembered, that all these Theses refer solely to one of the"
5172,THESIS IX,"two Polar Sciences, namely, to that which commences with, and rigidly"
5173,THESIS IX,"confines itself within, the subjective, leaving the objective (as far"
5174,THESIS IX,"as it is exclusively objective) to natural philosophy, which is its"
5175,THESIS IX,opposite pole. In its very idea therefore as a systematic knowledge of
5176,THESIS IX,"our collective KNOWING, (scientia scientiae) it involves the necessity"
5177,THESIS IX,"of some one highest principle of knowing, as at once the source and"
5178,THESIS IX,accompanying form in all particular acts of intellect and perception.
5179,THESIS IX,"This, it has been shown, can be found only in the act and evolution of"
5180,THESIS IX,self-consciousness. We are not investigating an absolute principium
5181,THESIS IX,"essendi; for then, I admit, many valid objections might be started"
5182,THESIS IX,against our theory; but an absolute principium cognoscendi. The result
5183,THESIS IX,"of both the sciences, or their equatorial point, would be the principle"
5184,THESIS IX,"of a total and undivided philosophy, as, for prudential reasons, I"
5185,THESIS IX,have chosen to anticipate in the Scholium to Thesis VI and the note
5186,THESIS IX,"subjoined. In other words, philosophy would pass into religion, and"
5187,THESIS IX,religion become inclusive of philosophy. We begin with the I KNOW
5188,THESIS IX,"MYSELF, in order to end with the absolute I AM. We proceed from the"
5189,THESIS IX,"SELF, in order to lose and find all self in GOD."

5192,THESIS X,
5193,THESIS X,"The transcendental philosopher does not inquire, what ultimate ground of"
5194,THESIS X,"our knowledge there may lie out of our knowing, but what is the last in"
5195,THESIS X,"our knowing itself, beyond which we cannot pass. The principle of our"
5196,THESIS X,knowing is sought within the sphere of our knowing. It must be some
5197,THESIS X,"thing therefore, which can itself be known. It is asserted only, that"
5198,THESIS X,the act of self-consciousness is for us the source and principle of
5199,THESIS X,all our possible knowledge. Whether abstracted from us there exists any
5200,THESIS X,"thing higher and beyond this primary self-knowing, which is for us the"
5201,THESIS X,form of all our knowing must be decided by the result.
5202,THESIS X,
5203,THESIS X,"That the self-consciousness is the fixed point, to which for us all is"
5204,THESIS X,"mortised and annexed, needs no further proof. But that the"
5205,THESIS X,"self-consciousness may be the modification of a higher form of being,"
5206,THESIS X,"perhaps of a higher consciousness, and this again of a yet higher, and"
5207,THESIS X,"so on in an infinite regressus; in short, that self-consciousness may"
5208,THESIS X,"be itself something explicable into something, which must lie beyond"
5209,THESIS X,"the possibility of our knowledge, because the whole synthesis of our"
5210,THESIS X,"intelligence is first formed in and through the self-consciousness,"
5211,THESIS X,"does not at all concern us as transcendental philosophers. For to us,"
5212,THESIS X,"self-consciousness is not a kind of being, but a kind of knowing, and"
5213,THESIS X,that too the highest and farthest that exists for us. It may however be
5214,THESIS X,"shown, and has in part already been shown earlier, that even when the"
5215,THESIS X,"Objective is assumed as the first, we yet can never pass beyond the"
5216,THESIS X,"principle of self-consciousness. Should we attempt it, we must be"
5217,THESIS X,"driven back from ground to ground, each of which would cease to be a"
5218,THESIS X,ground the moment we pressed on it. We must be whirled down the gulf of
5219,THESIS X,an infinite series. But this would make our reason baffle the end and
5220,THESIS X,"purpose of all reason, namely, unity and system. Or we must break off"
5221,THESIS X,"the series arbitrarily, and affirm an absolute something that is in and"
5222,THESIS X,"of itself at once cause and effect (causa sui), subject and object, or"
5223,THESIS X,"rather the absolute identity of both. But as this is inconceivable,"
5224,THESIS X,"except in a self-consciousness, it follows, that even as natural"
5225,THESIS X,philosophers we must arrive at the same principle from which as
5226,THESIS X,"transcendental philosophers we set out; that is, in a"
5227,THESIS X,self-consciousness in which the principium essendi does not stand to
5228,THESIS X,"the principlum cognoscende in the relation of cause to effect, but both"
5229,THESIS X,the one and the other are co-inherent and identical. Thus the true
5230,THESIS X,system of natural philosophy places the sole reality of things in an
5231,THESIS X,"ABSOLUTE, which is at once causa sui et effectus, pataer autopator,"
5232,THESIS X,"uios heautou--in the absolute identity of subject and object, which it"
5233,THESIS X,"calls nature, and which in its highest power is nothing else than"
5234,THESIS X,self-conscious will or intelligence. In this sense the position of
5235,THESIS X,"Malebranche, that we see all things in God, is a strict philosophical"
5236,THESIS X,"truth; and equally true is the assertion of Hobbes, of Hartley, and of"
5237,THESIS X,"their masters in ancient Greece, that all real knowledge supposes a"
5238,THESIS X,"prior sensation. For sensation itself is but vision nascent, not the"
5239,THESIS X,"cause of intelligence, but intelligence itself revealed as an earlier"
5240,THESIS X,power in the process of self-construction.

5247,THESIS X,
5248,THESIS X,"Bearing then this in mind, that intelligence is a self-development, not"
5249,THESIS X,"a quality supervening to a substance, we may abstract from all degree,"
5250,THESIS X,"and for the purpose of philosophic construction reduce it to kind, under"
5251,THESIS X,the idea of an indestructible power with two opposite and counteracting
5252,THESIS X,"forces, which by a metaphor borrowed from astronomy, we may call the"
5253,THESIS X,centrifugal and centripetal forces. The intelligence in the one tends to
5254,THESIS X,"objectize itself, and in the other to know itself in the object. It"
5255,THESIS X,will be hereafter my business to construct by a series of intuitions
5256,THESIS X,"the progressive schemes, that must follow from such a power with such"
5257,THESIS X,"forces, till I arrive at the fulness of the human intelligence. For"
5258,THESIS X,"my present purpose, I assume such a power as my principle, in order to"
5259,THESIS X,"deduce from it a faculty, the generation, agency, and application of"
5260,THESIS X,which form the contents of the ensuing chapter.
5261,THESIS X,
5262,THESIS X,In a preceding page I have justified the use of technical terms in
5263,THESIS X,"philosophy, whenever they tend to preclude confusion of thought, and"
5264,THESIS X,when they assist the memory by the exclusive singleness of their meaning
5265,THESIS X,"more than they may, for a short time, bewilder the attention by their"
5266,THESIS X,"strangeness. I trust, that I have not extended this privilege beyond"
5267,THESIS X,"the grounds on which I have claimed it; namely, the conveniency of the"
5268,THESIS X,"scholastic phrase to distinguish the kind from all degrees, or rather"
5269,THESIS X,"to express the kind with the abstraction of degree, as for instance"
5270,THESIS X,"multeity instead of multitude; or secondly, for the sake of"
5271,THESIS X,"correspondence in sound in interdependent or antithetical terms, as"
5272,THESIS X,"subject and object; or lastly, to avoid the wearying recurrence of"
5273,THESIS X,"circumlocutions and definitions. Thus I shall venture to use potence,"
5274,THESIS X,"in order to express a specific degree of a power, in imitation of the"
5275,THESIS X,"Algebraists. I have even hazarded the new verb potenziate, with its"
5276,THESIS X,"derivatives, in order to express the combination or transfer of powers."
5277,THESIS X,"It is with new or unusual terms, as with privileges in courts of justice"
5278,THESIS X,"or legislature; there can be no legitimate privilege, where there"
5279,THESIS X,already exists a positive law adequate to the purpose; and when there is
5280,THESIS X,"no law in existence, the privilege is to be justified by its accordance"
5281,THESIS X,"with the end, or final cause, of all law. Unusual and new-coined"
5282,THESIS X,"words are doubtless an evil; but vagueness, confusion, and imperfect"
5283,THESIS X,"conveyance of our thoughts, are a far greater. Every system, which is"
5284,THESIS X,under the necessity of using terms not familiarized by the metaphysics
5285,THESIS X,"in fashion, will be described as written in an unintelligible style, and"
5286,THESIS X,the author must expect the charge of having substituted learned jargon
5287,THESIS X,"for clear conception; while, according to the creed of our modern"
5288,THESIS X,"philosophers, nothing is deemed a clear conception, but what is"
5289,THESIS X,representable by a distinct image. Thus the conceivable is reduced
5290,THESIS X,"within the bounds of the picturable. Hinc patet, qui fiat, ut cum"

5307,THESIS X,
5308,THESIS X,"Critics, who are most ready to bring this charge of pedantry and"
5309,THESIS X,"unintelligibility, are the most apt to overlook the important"
5310,THESIS X,"fact, that, besides the language of words, there is a language of"
5311,THESIS X,spirits--(sermo interior)--and that the former is only the vehicle of
5312,THESIS X,"the latter. Consequently their assurance, that they do not understand"
5313,THESIS X,"the philosophic writer, instead of proving any thing against the"
5314,THESIS X,"philosophy, may furnish an equal, and (caeteris paribus) even a stronger"
5315,THESIS X,presumption against their own philosophic talent.
5316,THESIS X,
5317,THESIS X,Great indeed are the obstacles which an English metaphysician has to
5318,THESIS X,"encounter. Amongst his most respectable and intelligent judges, there"
5319,THESIS X,will be many who have devoted their attention exclusively to the
5320,THESIS X,"concerns and interests of human life, and who bring with them to"
5321,THESIS X,the perusal of a philosophic system an habitual aversion to all
5322,THESIS X,"speculations, the utility and application of which are not evident"
5323,THESIS X,and immediate. To these I would in the first instance merely oppose an
5324,THESIS X,"authority, which they themselves hold venerable, that of Lord Bacon: non"
5325,THESIS X,"inutiles Scientiae existimandae sunt, quarum in se nullus est usus, si"
5326,THESIS X,ingenia acuant et ordinent.
5327,THESIS X,
5328,THESIS X,"There are others, whose prejudices are still more formidable, inasmuch"
5329,THESIS X,"as they are grounded in their moral feelings and religious principles,"
5330,THESIS X,which had been alarmed and shocked by the impious and pernicious tenets
5331,THESIS X,"defended by Hume, Priestley, and the French fatalists or necessitarians;"
5332,THESIS X,some of whom had perverted metaphysical reasonings to the denial of the
5333,THESIS X,mysteries and indeed of all the peculiar doctrines of Christianity;
5334,THESIS X,and others even to the subversion of all distinction between right
5335,THESIS X,and wrong. I would request such men to consider what an eminent and
5336,THESIS X,"successful defender of the Christian faith has observed, that true"
5337,THESIS X,"metaphysics are nothing else but true divinity, and that in fact the"
5338,THESIS X,"writers, who have given them such just offence, were sophists, who had"
5339,THESIS X,taken advantage of the general neglect into which the science of logic
5340,THESIS X,"has unhappily fallen, rather than metaphysicians, a name indeed which"
5341,THESIS X,"those writers were the first to explode as unmeaning. Secondly, I would"
5342,THESIS X,"remind them, that as long as there are men in the world to whom the"
5343,THESIS X,"Gnothi seauton is an instinct and a command from their own nature, so"
5344,THESIS X,long will there be metaphysicians and metaphysical speculations; that
5345,THESIS X,false metaphysics can be effectually counteracted by true metaphysics
5346,THESIS X,"alone; and that if the reasoning be clear, solid and pertinent, the"
5347,THESIS X,truth deduced can never be the less valuable on account of the depth
5348,THESIS X,from which it may have been drawn.
5349,THESIS X,
5350,THESIS X,"A third class profess themselves friendly to metaphysics, and believe"
5351,THESIS X,that they are themselves metaphysicians. They have no objection to
5352,THESIS X,"system or terminology, provided it be the method and the nomenclature"
5353,THESIS X,"to which they have been familiarized in the writings of Locke, Hume,"
5354,THESIS X,"Hartley, Condillac, or perhaps Dr. Reid, and Professor Stewart. To"
5355,THESIS X,"objections from this cause, it is a sufficient answer, that one main"
5356,THESIS X,object of my attempt was to demonstrate the vagueness or insufficiency
5357,THESIS X,of the terms used in the metaphysical schools of France and Great
5358,THESIS X,"Britain since the revolution, and that the errors which I propose to"
5359,THESIS X,"attack cannot subsist, except as they are concealed behind the mask of a"
5360,THESIS X,plausible and indefinite nomenclature.
5361,THESIS X,
5362,THESIS X,But the worst and widest impediment still remains. It is the
5363,THESIS X,"predominance of a popular philosophy, at once the counterfeit and the"
5364,THESIS X,mortal enemy of all true and manly metaphysical research. It is that
5365,THESIS X,"corruption, introduced by certain immethodical aphorisming eclectics,"
5366,THESIS X,"who, dismissing not only all system, but all logical connection, pick"
5367,THESIS X,"and choose whatever is most plausible and showy; who select, whatever"
5368,THESIS X,words can have some semblance of sense attached to them without the
5369,THESIS X,least expenditure of thought; in short whatever may enable men to talk
5370,THESIS X,"of what they do not understand, with a careful avoidance of every thing"
5371,THESIS X,that might awaken them to a moment’s suspicion of their ignorance. This
5372,THESIS X,"alas! is an irremediable disease, for it brings with it, not so much an"
5373,THESIS X,"indisposition to any particular system, but an utter loss of taste and"
5374,THESIS X,faculty for all system and for all philosophy. Like echoes that beget
5375,THESIS X,"each other amongst the mountains, the praise or blame of such men"
5376,THESIS X,rolls in volleys long after the report from the original blunderbuss.

5379,THESIS X,
5380,THESIS X,I shall now proceed to the nature and genesis of the Imagination; but I
5381,THESIS X,"must first take leave to notice, that after a more accurate perusal of"
5382,THESIS X,"Mr. Wordsworth’s remarks on the Imagination, in his preface to the new"
5383,THESIS X,"edition of his poems, I find that my conclusions are not so consentient"
5384,THESIS X,"with his as, I confess, I had taken for granted. In an article"
5385,THESIS X,"contributed by me to Mr. Southey’s Omniana, On the soul and its organs"
5386,THESIS X,"of sense, are the following sentences. “These (the human faculties) I"
5387,THESIS X,"would arrange under the different senses and powers: as the eye, the"
5388,THESIS X,"ear, the touch, etc.; the imitative power, voluntary and automatic;"
5389,THESIS X,"the imagination, or shaping and modifying power; the fancy, or the"
5390,THESIS X,"aggregative and associative power; the understanding, or the regulative,"
5391,THESIS X,"substantiating and realizing power; the speculative reason, vis"
5392,THESIS X,"theoretica et scientifica, or the power by which we produce or aim to"
5393,THESIS X,"produce unity, necessity, and universality in all our knowledge by means"
5394,THESIS X,"of principles a priori [56]; the will, or practical reason; the faculty"
5395,THESIS X,"of choice (Germanice, Willkuehr) and (distinct both from the moral will"
5396,THESIS X,"and the choice,) the sensation of volition, which I have found reason to"
5397,THESIS X,"include under the head of single and double touch.” To this, as far as"
5398,THESIS X,"it relates to the subject in question, namely the words (the aggregative"
5399,THESIS X,and associative power) Mr. Wordsworth’s “objection is only that the
5400,THESIS X,"definition is too general. To aggregate and to associate, to evoke and"
5401,THESIS X,"to combine, belong as well to the Imagination as to the Fancy.” I reply,"
5402,THESIS X,"that if, by the power of evoking and combining, Mr. Wordsworth means the"
5403,THESIS X,"same as, and no more than, I meant by the aggregative and associative,"
5404,THESIS X,"I continue to deny, that it belongs at all to the Imagination; and I"
5405,THESIS X,"am disposed to conjecture, that he has mistaken the copresence of Fancy"
5406,THESIS X,with Imagination for the operation of the latter singly. A man may work
5407,THESIS X,with two very different tools at the same moment; each has its share in
5408,THESIS X,"the work, but the work effected by each is distinct and different. But"
5409,THESIS X,"it will probably appear in the next chapter, that deeming it necessary"
5410,THESIS X,to go back much further than Mr. Wordsworth’s subject required or
5411,THESIS X,"permitted, I have attached a meaning to both Fancy and Imagination,"
5412,THESIS X,"which he had not in view, at least while he was writing that preface. He"
5413,THESIS X,"will judge. Would to Heaven, I might meet with many such readers! I will"
5414,THESIS X,conclude with the words of Bishop Jeremy Taylor: “He to whom all things
5415,THESIS X,"are one, who draweth all things to one, and seeth all things in one, may"
5416,THESIS X,enjoy true peace and rest of spirit.” [57]

5470,CHAPTER XIII,We must of course understand him to have meant; I will render the
5471,CHAPTER XIII,construction of the universe intelligible. In the same sense the
5472,CHAPTER XIII,transcendental philosopher says; grant me a nature having two contrary
5473,CHAPTER XIII,"forces, the one of which tends to expand infinitely, while the other"
5474,CHAPTER XIII,"strives to apprehend or find itself in this infinity, and I will"
5475,CHAPTER XIII,cause the world of intelllgences with the whole system of their
5476,CHAPTER XIII,representations to rise up before you. Every other science presupposes

5480,CHAPTER XIII,
5481,CHAPTER XIII,The venerable sage of Koenigsberg has preceded the march of this
5482,CHAPTER XIII,master-thought as an effective pioneer in his essay on the introduction
5483,CHAPTER XIII,"of negative quantities into philosophy, published 1763. In this he"
5484,CHAPTER XIII,"has shown, that instead of assailing the science of mathematics by"
5485,CHAPTER XIII,"metaphysics, as Berkeley did in his ANALYST, or of sophisticating it,"
5486,CHAPTER XIII,"as Wolf did, by the vain attempt of deducing the first principles"
5487,CHAPTER XIII,"of geometry from supposed deeper grounds of ontology, it behoved the"
5488,CHAPTER XIII,"metaphysician rather to examine whether the only province of knowledge,"
5489,CHAPTER XIII,"which man has succeeded in erecting into a pure science, might not"
5490,CHAPTER XIII,"furnish materials, or at least hints, for establishing and pacifying the"
5491,CHAPTER XIII,"unsettled, warring, and embroiled domain of philosophy. An imitation of"
5492,CHAPTER XIII,the mathematical method had indeed been attempted with no better success
5493,CHAPTER XIII,than attended the essay of David to wear the armour of Saul. Another
5494,CHAPTER XIII,"use however is possible and of far greater promise, namely, the actual"
5495,CHAPTER XIII,application of the positions which had so wonderfully enlarged the
5496,CHAPTER XIII,"discoveries of geometry, mutatis mutandis, to philosophical subjects."
5497,CHAPTER XIII,Kant having briefly illustrated the utility of such an attempt in the
5498,CHAPTER XIII,"questions of space, motion, and infinitely small quantities, as employed"
5499,CHAPTER XIII,"by the mathematician, proceeds to the idea of negative quantities and"
5500,CHAPTER XIII,"the transfer of them to metaphysical investigation. Opposites, he"
5501,CHAPTER XIII,"well observes, are of two kinds, either logical, that is, such as are"
5502,CHAPTER XIII,"absolutely incompatible; or real, without being contradictory. The"
5503,CHAPTER XIII,"former he denominates Nihil negativum irrepraesentabile, the connection"
5504,CHAPTER XIII,of which produces nonsense. A body in motion is something--Aliquid
5505,CHAPTER XIII,"cogitabile; but a body, at one and the same time in motion and not in"
5506,CHAPTER XIII,"motion, is nothing, or, at most, air articulated into nonsense. But a"
5507,CHAPTER XIII,"motory force of a body in one direction, and an equal force of the"
5508,CHAPTER XIII,"same body in an opposite direction is not incompatible, and the"
5509,CHAPTER XIII,"result, namely, rest, is real and representable. For the purposes of"
5510,CHAPTER XIII,"mathematical calculus it is indifferent which force we term negative,"
5511,CHAPTER XIII,"and which positive, and consequently we appropriate the latter to that,"
5512,CHAPTER XIII,which happens to be the principal object in our thoughts. Thus if a
5513,CHAPTER XIII,"man’s capital be ten and his debts eight, the subtraction will be the"
5514,CHAPTER XIII,"same, whether we call the capital negative debt, or the debt negative"
5515,CHAPTER XIII,capital. But in as much as the latter stands practically in reference to
5516,CHAPTER XIII,"the former, we of course represent the sum as 10-8. It is equally clear"
5517,CHAPTER XIII,"that two equal forces acting in opposite directions, both being finite"
5518,CHAPTER XIII,"and each distinguished from the other by its direction only, must"
5519,CHAPTER XIII,neutralize or reduce each other to inaction. Now the transcendental
5520,CHAPTER XIII,"philosophy demands; first, that two forces should be conceived which"
5521,CHAPTER XIII,counteract each other by their essential nature; not only not in
5522,CHAPTER XIII,"consequence of the accidental direction of each, but as prior to all"
5523,CHAPTER XIII,"direction, nay, as the primary forces from which the conditions of all"
5524,CHAPTER XIII,"possible directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that"
5525,CHAPTER XIII,"these forces should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike"
5526,CHAPTER XIII,indestructible. The problem will then be to discover the result or
5527,CHAPTER XIII,"product of two such forces, as distinguished from the result of those"
5528,CHAPTER XIII,"forces which are finite, and derive their difference solely from the"
5529,CHAPTER XIII,circumstance of their direction. When we have formed a scheme or outline
5530,CHAPTER XIII,"of these two different kinds of force, and of their different results,"
5531,CHAPTER XIII,"by the process of discursive reasoning, it will then remain for us to"
5532,CHAPTER XIII,"elevate the thesis from notional to actual, by contemplating intuitively"
5533,CHAPTER XIII,this one power with its two inherent indestructible yet counteracting
5534,CHAPTER XIII,"forces, and the results or generations to which their inter-penetration"
5535,CHAPTER XIII,"gives existence, in the living principle and in the process of our own"
5536,CHAPTER XIII,self-consciousness. By what instrument this is possible the solution
5537,CHAPTER XIII,"itself will discover, at the same time that it will reveal to and for"
5538,CHAPTER XIII,whom it is possible. Non omnia possumus omnes. There is a philosophic
5539,CHAPTER XIII,"no less than a poetic genius, which is differenced from the highest"
5540,CHAPTER XIII,"perfection of talent, not by degree but by kind."
5541,CHAPTER XIII,
5542,CHAPTER XIII,The counteraction then of the two assumed forces does not depend on
5543,CHAPTER XIII,their meeting from opposite directions; the power which acts in them
5544,CHAPTER XIII,is indestructible; it is therefore inexhaustibly re-ebullient; and as
5545,CHAPTER XIII,"something must be the result of these two forces, both alike infinite,"
5546,CHAPTER XIII,and both alike indestructible; and as rest or neutralization cannot be
5547,CHAPTER XIII,"this result; no other conception is possible, but that the product must"
5548,CHAPTER XIII,"be a tertium aliquid, or finite generation. Consequently this conception"
5549,CHAPTER XIII,is necessary. Now this tertium aliquid can be no other than an
5550,CHAPTER XIII,"inter-penetration of the counteracting powers, partaking of both."

5632,CHAPTER XIII,"I have before hinted, be almost entitled to accuse you of a sort of"
5633,CHAPTER XIII,"imposition on him. For who, he might truly observe, could from your"
5634,CHAPTER XIII,"title-page, to wit, “My Literary Life and Opinions,” published too as"
5635,CHAPTER XIII,"introductory to a volume of miscellaneous poems, have anticipated, or"
5636,CHAPTER XIII,"even conjectured, a long treatise on Ideal Realism which holds the same"
5637,CHAPTER XIII,"relation in abstruseness to Plotinus, as Plotinus does to Plato. It will"
5638,CHAPTER XIII,"be well, if already you have not too much of metaphysical disquisition"
5639,CHAPTER XIII,"in your work, though as the larger part of the disquisition is"
5640,CHAPTER XIII,"historical, it will doubtless be both interesting and instructive to"
5641,CHAPTER XIII,many to whose unprepared minds your speculations on the esemplastic
5642,CHAPTER XIII,"power would be utterly unintelligible. Be assured, if you do publish"
5643,CHAPTER XIII,"this Chapter in the present work, you will be reminded of Bishop"
5644,CHAPTER XIII,"Berkeley’s Siris, announced as an Essay on Tar-water, which beginning"
5645,CHAPTER XIII,"with Tar ends with the Trinity, the omne scibile forming the interspace."
5646,CHAPTER XIII,I say in the present work. In that greater work to which you have
5647,CHAPTER XIII,"devoted so many years, and study so intense and various, it will be in"
5648,CHAPTER XIII,its proper place. Your prospectus will have described and announced both
5649,CHAPTER XIII,"its contents and their nature; and if any persons purchase it, who"
5650,CHAPTER XIII,"feel no interest in the subjects of which it treats, they will have"
5651,CHAPTER XIII,themselves only to blame.
5652,CHAPTER XIII,
5653,CHAPTER XIII,"“I could add to these arguments one derived from pecuniary motives,"
5654,CHAPTER XIII,and particularly from the probable effects on the sale of your present
5655,CHAPTER XIII,publication; but they would weigh little with you compared with the
5656,CHAPTER XIII,"preceding. Besides, I have long observed, that arguments drawn from"
5657,CHAPTER XIII,your own personal interests more often act on you as narcotics than as
5658,CHAPTER XIII,"stimulants, and that in money concerns you have some small portion"
5659,CHAPTER XIII,"of pig-nature in your moral idiosyncrasy, and, like these amiable"
5660,CHAPTER XIII,"creatures, must occasionally be pulled backward from the boat in order"
5661,CHAPTER XIII,"to make you enter it. All success attend you, for if hard thinking and"
5662,CHAPTER XIII,"hard reading are merits, you have deserved it."

5668,CHAPTER XIII,"conviction on my mind, I shall content myself for the present with"
5669,CHAPTER XIII,"stating the main result of the chapter, which I have reserved for that"
5670,CHAPTER XIII,"future publication, a detailed prospectus of which the reader will find"
5671,CHAPTER XIII,at the close of the second volume.

5673,CHAPTER XIII,"The Imagination then I consider either as primary, or secondary. The"
5674,CHAPTER XIII,primary Imagination I hold to be the living power and prime agent of all
5675,CHAPTER XIII,"human perception, and as a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal"
5676,CHAPTER XIII,act of creation in the infinite I AM. The secondary Imagination I
5677,CHAPTER XIII,"consider as an echo of the former, co-existing with the conscious will,"
5678,CHAPTER XIII,"yet still as identical with the primary in the kind of its agency,"
5679,CHAPTER XIII,"and differing only in degree, and in the mode of its operation. It"
5680,CHAPTER XIII,"dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to recreate: or where this"
5681,CHAPTER XIII,"process is rendered impossible, yet still at all events it struggles to"
5682,CHAPTER XIII,"idealize and to unify. It is essentially vital, even as all objects (as"
5683,CHAPTER XIII,objects) are essentially fixed and dead.
5684,CHAPTER XIII,
5685,CHAPTER XIII,"FANCY, on the contrary, has no other counters to play with, but fixities"
5686,CHAPTER XIII,and definites. The fancy is indeed no other than a mode of memory
5687,CHAPTER XIII,"emancipated from the order of time and space; while it is blended with,"
5688,CHAPTER XIII,"and modified by that empirical phaenomenon of the will, which we express"
5689,CHAPTER XIII,by the word Choice. But equally with the ordinary memory the Fancy must
5690,CHAPTER XIII,receive all its materials ready made from the law of association.

5701,CHAPTER XIV,
5702,CHAPTER XIV,
5703,CHAPTER XIV,"During the first year that Mr. Wordsworth and I were neighbours, our"
5704,CHAPTER XIV,"conversations turned frequently on the two cardinal points of poetry,"
5705,CHAPTER XIV,the power of exciting the sympathy of the reader by a faithful adherence
5706,CHAPTER XIV,"to the truth of nature, and the power of giving the interest of novelty"
5707,CHAPTER XIV,"by the modifying colours of imagination. The sudden charm, which"
5708,CHAPTER XIV,"accidents of light and shade, which moon-light or sunset diffused over"
5709,CHAPTER XIV,"a known and familiar landscape, appeared to represent the practicability"
5710,CHAPTER XIV,of combining both. These are the poetry of nature. The thought suggested
5711,CHAPTER XIV,itself--(to which of us I do not recollect)--that a series of poems
5712,CHAPTER XIV,"might be composed of two sorts. In the one, the incidents and agents"
5713,CHAPTER XIV,"were to be, in part at least, supernatural; and the excellence aimed"
5714,CHAPTER XIV,at was to consist in the interesting of the affections by the dramatic
5715,CHAPTER XIV,"truth of such emotions, as would naturally accompany such situations,"
5716,CHAPTER XIV,supposing them real. And real in this sense they have been to every
5717,CHAPTER XIV,"human being who, from whatever source of delusion, has at any time"
5718,CHAPTER XIV,"believed himself under supernatural agency. For the second class,"
5719,CHAPTER XIV,subjects were to be chosen from ordinary life; the characters and
5720,CHAPTER XIV,incidents were to be such as will be found in every village and its
5721,CHAPTER XIV,"vicinity, where there is a meditative and feeling mind to seek after"
5722,CHAPTER XIV,"them, or to notice them, when they present themselves."
5723,CHAPTER XIV,
5724,CHAPTER XIV,In this idea originated the plan of the LYRICAL BALLADS; in which it was
5725,CHAPTER XIV,"agreed, that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters"
5726,CHAPTER XIV,"supernatural, or at least romantic; yet so as to transfer from our"
5727,CHAPTER XIV,inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to
5728,CHAPTER XIV,procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension
5729,CHAPTER XIV,"of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith. Mr."
5730,CHAPTER XIV,"Wordsworth, on the other hand, was to propose to himself as his object,"
5731,CHAPTER XIV,"to give the charm of novelty to things of every day, and to excite a"
5732,CHAPTER XIV,"feeling analogous to the supernatural, by awakening the mind’s attention"
5733,CHAPTER XIV,"to the lethargy of custom, and directing it to the loveliness and the"
5734,CHAPTER XIV,"wonders of the world before us; an inexhaustible treasure, but for"
5735,CHAPTER XIV,"which, in consequence of the film of familiarity and selfish solicitude,"
5736,CHAPTER XIV,"we have eyes, yet see not, ears that hear not, and hearts that neither"
5737,CHAPTER XIV,feel nor understand.
5738,CHAPTER XIV,
5739,CHAPTER XIV,"With this view I wrote THE ANCIENT MARINER, and was preparing among"
5740,CHAPTER XIV,"other poems, THE DARK LADIE, and the CHRISTABEL, in which I should have"
5741,CHAPTER XIV,"more nearly realized my ideal, than I had done in my first attempt. But"
5742,CHAPTER XIV,"Mr. Wordsworth’s industry had proved so much more successful, and the"
5743,CHAPTER XIV,"number of his poems so much greater, that my compositions, instead of"
5744,CHAPTER XIV,"forming a balance, appeared rather an interpolation of heterogeneous"
5745,CHAPTER XIV,matter. Mr. Wordsworth added two or three poems written in his own
5746,CHAPTER XIV,"character, in the impassioned, lofty, and sustained diction, which is"
5747,CHAPTER XIV,characteristic of his genius. In this form the LYRICAL BALLADS were
5748,CHAPTER XIV,"published; and were presented by him, as an experiment, whether"
5749,CHAPTER XIV,"subjects, which from their nature rejected the usual ornaments and"
5750,CHAPTER XIV,"extra-colloquial style of poems in general, might not be so managed in"
5751,CHAPTER XIV,"the language of ordinary life as to produce the pleasurable interest,"
5752,CHAPTER XIV,which it is the peculiar business of poetry to impart. To the
5753,CHAPTER XIV,"second edition he added a preface of considerable length; in which,"
5754,CHAPTER XIV,"notwithstanding some passages of apparently a contrary import, he was"
5755,CHAPTER XIV,understood to contend for the extension of this style to poetry of all
5756,CHAPTER XIV,"kinds, and to reject as vicious and indefensible all phrases and forms"
5757,CHAPTER XIV,"of speech that were not included in what he (unfortunately, I think,"
5758,CHAPTER XIV,adopting an equivocal expression) called the language of real life. From
5759,CHAPTER XIV,"this preface, prefixed to poems in which it was impossible to deny the"
5760,CHAPTER XIV,"presence of original genius, however mistaken its direction might"
5761,CHAPTER XIV,"be deemed, arose the whole long-continued controversy. For from the"
5762,CHAPTER XIV,conjunction of perceived power with supposed heresy I explain the
5763,CHAPTER XIV,"inveteracy and in some instances, I grieve to say, the acrimonious"
5764,CHAPTER XIV,"passions, with which the controversy has been conducted by the"
5765,CHAPTER XIV,assailants.
5766,CHAPTER XIV,
5767,CHAPTER XIV,"Had Mr. Wordsworth’s poems been the silly, the childish things, which"
5768,CHAPTER XIV,they were for a long time described as being had they been really
5769,CHAPTER XIV,distinguished from the compositions of other poets merely by meanness of
5770,CHAPTER XIV,language and inanity of thought; had they indeed contained nothing more
5771,CHAPTER XIV,than what is found in the parodies and pretended imitations of them;
5772,CHAPTER XIV,"they must have sunk at once, a dead weight, into the slough of oblivion,"
5773,CHAPTER XIV,and have dragged the preface along with them. But year after year
5774,CHAPTER XIV,increased the number of Mr. Wordsworth’s admirers. They were found too
5775,CHAPTER XIV,"not in the lower classes of the reading public, but chiefly among young"
5776,CHAPTER XIV,men of strong sensibility and meditative minds; and their admiration
5777,CHAPTER XIV,(inflamed perhaps in some degree by opposition) was distinguished by its
5778,CHAPTER XIV,"intensity, I might almost say, by its religious fervour. These facts,"
5779,CHAPTER XIV,"and the intellectual energy of the author, which was more or less"
5780,CHAPTER XIV,"consciously felt, where it was outwardly and even boisterously denied,"
5781,CHAPTER XIV,"meeting with sentiments of aversion to his opinions, and of alarm at"
5782,CHAPTER XIV,"their consequences, produced an eddy of criticism, which would of itself"
5783,CHAPTER XIV,have borne up the poems by the violence with which it whirled them round
5784,CHAPTER XIV,and round. With many parts of this preface in the sense attributed
5785,CHAPTER XIV,"to them and which the words undoubtedly seem to authorize, I never"
5786,CHAPTER XIV,concurred; but on the contrary objected to them as erroneous in
5787,CHAPTER XIV,"principle, and as contradictory (in appearance at least) both to other"
5788,CHAPTER XIV,"parts of the same preface, and to the author’s own practice in the"
5789,CHAPTER XIV,greater part of the poems themselves. Mr. Wordsworth in his recent
5790,CHAPTER XIV,"collection has, I find, degraded this prefatory disquisition to the end"
5791,CHAPTER XIV,"of his second volume, to be read or not at the reader’s choice. But he"
5792,CHAPTER XIV,"has not, as far as I can discover, announced any change in his poetic"
5793,CHAPTER XIV,"creed. At all events, considering it as the source of a controversy,"
5794,CHAPTER XIV,in which I have been honoured more than I deserve by the frequent
5795,CHAPTER XIV,"conjunction of my name with his, I think it expedient to declare once"
5796,CHAPTER XIV,"for all, in what points I coincide with the opinions supported in that"
5797,CHAPTER XIV,"preface, and in what points I altogether differ. But in order to render"
5798,CHAPTER XIV,"myself intelligible I must previously, in as few words as possible,"
5799,CHAPTER XIV,"explain my views, first, of a Poem; and secondly, of Poetry itself, in"
5800,CHAPTER XIV,"kind, and in essence."
5801,CHAPTER XIV,
5802,CHAPTER XIV,The office of philosophical disquisition consists in just distinction;
5803,CHAPTER XIV,while it is the privilege of the philosopher to preserve himself
5804,CHAPTER XIV,"constantly aware, that distinction is not division. In order to obtain"
5805,CHAPTER XIV,"adequate notions of any truth, we must intellectually separate its"
5806,CHAPTER XIV,distinguishable parts; and this is the technical process of philosophy.
5807,CHAPTER XIV,"But having so done, we must then restore them in our conceptions to"
5808,CHAPTER XIV,"the unity, in which they actually co-exist; and this is the result of"
5809,CHAPTER XIV,philosophy. A poem contains the same elements as a prose composition;
5810,CHAPTER XIV,the difference therefore must consist in a different combination of
5811,CHAPTER XIV,"them, in consequence of a different object being proposed. According to"
5812,CHAPTER XIV,the difference of the object will be the difference of the combination.
5813,CHAPTER XIV,"It is possible, that the object may be merely to facilitate the"
5814,CHAPTER XIV,recollection of any given facts or observations by artificial
5815,CHAPTER XIV,"arrangement; and the composition will be a poem, merely because it is"
5816,CHAPTER XIV,"distinguished from prose by metre, or by rhyme, or by both conjointly."
5817,CHAPTER XIV,"In this, the lowest sense, a man might attribute the name of a poem to"
5818,CHAPTER XIV,the well-known enumeration of the days in the several months;
5819,CHAPTER XIV,
5820,CHAPTER XIV,"“Thirty days hath September,"
5821,CHAPTER XIV,"April, June, and November,” etc."
5822,CHAPTER XIV,
5823,CHAPTER XIV,and others of the same class and purpose. And as a particular pleasure
5824,CHAPTER XIV,"is found in anticipating the recurrence of sounds and quantities,"
5825,CHAPTER XIV,"all compositions that have this charm super-added, whatever be their"
5826,CHAPTER XIV,"contents, may be entitled poems."
5827,CHAPTER XIV,
5828,CHAPTER XIV,So much for the superficial form. A difference of object and contents
5829,CHAPTER XIV,supplies an additional ground of distinction. The immediate purpose
5830,CHAPTER XIV,may be the communication of truths; either of truth absolute and
5831,CHAPTER XIV,"demonstrable, as in works of science; or of facts experienced and"
5832,CHAPTER XIV,"recorded, as in history. Pleasure, and that of the highest and most"
5833,CHAPTER XIV,"permanent kind, may result from the attainment of the end; but it is not"
5834,CHAPTER XIV,itself the immediate end. In other works the communication of pleasure
5835,CHAPTER XIV,"may be the immediate purpose; and though truth, either moral or"
5836,CHAPTER XIV,"intellectual, ought to be the ultimate end, yet this will distinguish"
5837,CHAPTER XIV,"the character of the author, not the class to which the work belongs."
5838,CHAPTER XIV,"Blest indeed is that state of society, in which the immediate purpose"
5839,CHAPTER XIV,would be baffled by the perversion of the proper ultimate end; in which
5840,CHAPTER XIV,no charm of diction or imagery could exempt the BATHYLLUS even of an
5841,CHAPTER XIV,"Anacreon, or the ALEXIS of Virgil, from disgust and aversion!"
5842,CHAPTER XIV,
5843,CHAPTER XIV,But the communication of pleasure may be the immediate object of a work
5844,CHAPTER XIV,not metrically composed; and that object may have been in a high degree
5845,CHAPTER XIV,"attained, as in novels and romances. Would then the mere superaddition"
5846,CHAPTER XIV,"of metre, with or without rhyme, entitle these to the name of poems? The"
5847,CHAPTER XIV,"answer is, that nothing can permanently please, which does not contain"
5848,CHAPTER XIV,"in itself the reason why it is so, and not otherwise. If metre be"
5849,CHAPTER XIV,"superadded, all other parts must be made consonant with it. They must be"
5850,CHAPTER XIV,"such, as to justify the perpetual and distinct attention to each"
5851,CHAPTER XIV,"part, which an exact correspondent recurrence of accent and sound are"
5852,CHAPTER XIV,"calculated to excite. The final definition then, so deduced, may be thus"
5853,CHAPTER XIV,"worded. A poem is that species of composition, which is opposed to works"
5854,CHAPTER XIV,"of science, by proposing for its immediate object pleasure, not truth;"
5855,CHAPTER XIV,and from all other species--(having this object in common with it)--it
5856,CHAPTER XIV,"is discriminated by proposing to itself such delight from the whole, as"
5857,CHAPTER XIV,is compatible with a distinct gratification from each component part.
5858,CHAPTER XIV,
5859,CHAPTER XIV,Controversy is not seldom excited in consequence of the disputants
5860,CHAPTER XIV,attaching each a different meaning to the same word; and in few
5861,CHAPTER XIV,"instances has this been more striking, than in disputes concerning the"
5862,CHAPTER XIV,present subject. If a man chooses to call every composition a
5863,CHAPTER XIV,"poem, which is rhyme, or measure, or both, I must leave his opinion"
5864,CHAPTER XIV,uncontroverted. The distinction is at least competent to characterize
5865,CHAPTER XIV,"the writer’s intention. If it were subjoined, that the whole is likewise"
5866,CHAPTER XIV,"entertaining or affecting, as a tale, or as a series of interesting"
5867,CHAPTER XIV,"reflections; I of course admit this as another fit ingredient of a poem,"
5868,CHAPTER XIV,and an additional merit. But if the definition sought for be that of a
5869,CHAPTER XIV,"legitimate poem, I answer, it must be one, the parts of which mutually"
5870,CHAPTER XIV,support and explain each other; all in their proportion harmonizing
5871,CHAPTER XIV,"with, and supporting the purpose and known influences of metrical"
5872,CHAPTER XIV,arrangement. The philosophic critics of all ages coincide with the
5873,CHAPTER XIV,"ultimate judgment of all countries, in equally denying the praises of a"
5874,CHAPTER XIV,"just poem, on the one hand, to a series of striking lines or distiches,"
5875,CHAPTER XIV,"each of which, absorbing the whole attention of the reader to itself,"
5876,CHAPTER XIV,"becomes disjoined from its context, and forms a separate whole,"
5877,CHAPTER XIV,"instead of a harmonizing part; and on the other hand, to an unsustained"
5878,CHAPTER XIV,"composition, from which the reader collects rapidly the general result"
5879,CHAPTER XIV,unattracted by the component parts. The reader should be carried
5880,CHAPTER XIV,"forward, not merely or chiefly by the mechanical impulse of curiosity,"
5881,CHAPTER XIV,or by a restless desire to arrive at the final solution; but by the
5882,CHAPTER XIV,pleasureable activity of mind excited by the attractions of the journey
5883,CHAPTER XIV,"itself. Like the motion of a serpent, which the Egyptians made the"
5884,CHAPTER XIV,emblem of intellectual power; or like the path of sound through
5885,CHAPTER XIV,the air;--at every step he pauses and half recedes; and from the
5886,CHAPTER XIV,retrogressive movement collects the force which again carries him
5887,CHAPTER XIV,"onward. Praecipitandus est liber spiritus, says Petronius most happily."
5888,CHAPTER XIV,"The epithet, liber, here balances the preceding verb; and it is not easy"
5889,CHAPTER XIV,to conceive more meaning condensed in fewer words.
5890,CHAPTER XIV,
5891,CHAPTER XIV,"But if this should be admitted as a satisfactory character of a poem,"
5892,CHAPTER XIV,"we have still to seek for a definition of poetry. The writings of Plato,"
5893,CHAPTER XIV,"and Jeremy Taylor, and Burnet’s Theory of the Earth, furnish undeniable"
5894,CHAPTER XIV,"proofs that poetry of the highest kind may exist without metre, and even"
5895,CHAPTER XIV,without the contradistringuishing objects of a poem. The first chapter
5896,CHAPTER XIV,of Isaiah--(indeed a very large portion of the whole book)--is poetry
5897,CHAPTER XIV,in the most emphatic sense; yet it would be not less irrational than
5898,CHAPTER XIV,"strange to assert, that pleasure, and not truth was the immediate object"
5899,CHAPTER XIV,"of the prophet. In short, whatever specific import we attach to the"
5900,CHAPTER XIV,"word, Poetry, there will be found involved in it, as a necessary"
5901,CHAPTER XIV,"consequence, that a poem of any length neither can be, nor ought to be,"
5902,CHAPTER XIV,"all poetry. Yet if an harmonious whole is to be produced, the remaining"
5903,CHAPTER XIV,parts must be preserved in keeping with the poetry; and this can be
5904,CHAPTER XIV,no otherwise effected than by such a studied selection and artificial
5905,CHAPTER XIV,"arrangement, as will partake of one, though not a peculiar property of"
5906,CHAPTER XIV,poetry. And this again can be no other than the property of exciting a
5907,CHAPTER XIV,"more continuous and equal attention than the language of prose aims at,"
5908,CHAPTER XIV,whether colloquial or written.
5909,CHAPTER XIV,
5910,CHAPTER XIV,"My own conclusions on the nature of poetry, in the strictest use of the"
5911,CHAPTER XIV,"word, have been in part anticipated in some of the remarks on the Fancy"
5912,CHAPTER XIV,and Imagination in the early part of this work. What is poetry?--is so
5913,CHAPTER XIV,"nearly the same question with, what is a poet?--that the answer to the"
5914,CHAPTER XIV,one is involved in the solution of the other. For it is a distinction
5915,CHAPTER XIV,"resulting from the poetic genius itself, which sustains and modifies the"
5916,CHAPTER XIV,"images, thoughts, and emotions of the poet’s own mind."
5917,CHAPTER XIV,
5918,CHAPTER XIV,"The poet, described in ideal perfection, brings the whole soul of man"
5919,CHAPTER XIV,"into activity, with the subordination of its faculties to each other"
5920,CHAPTER XIV,according to their relative worth and dignity. He diffuses a tone and
5921,CHAPTER XIV,"spirit of unity, that blends, and (as it were) fuses, each into each,"
5922,CHAPTER XIV,"by that synthetic and magical power, to which I would exclusively"
5923,CHAPTER XIV,"appropriate the name of Imagination. This power, first put in action by"
5924,CHAPTER XIV,"the will and understanding, and retained under their irremissive, though"
5925,CHAPTER XIV,"gentle and unnoticed, control, laxis effertur habenis, reveals “itself"
5926,CHAPTER XIV,in the balance or reconcilement of opposite or discordant” qualities:
5927,CHAPTER XIV,"of sameness, with difference; of the general with the concrete; the idea"
5928,CHAPTER XIV,with the image; the individual with the representative; the sense of
5929,CHAPTER XIV,novelty and freshness with old and familiar objects; a more than usual
5930,CHAPTER XIV,state of emotion with more than usual order; judgment ever awake and
5931,CHAPTER XIV,steady self-possession with enthusiasm and feeling profound or vehement;
5932,CHAPTER XIV,"and while it blends and harmonizes the natural and the artificial, still"
5933,CHAPTER XIV,subordinates art to nature; the manner to the matter; and our admiration
5934,CHAPTER XIV,"of the poet to our sympathy with the poetry. Doubtless, as Sir John"
5935,CHAPTER XIV,Davies observes of the soul--(and his words may with slight alteration
5936,CHAPTER XIV,"be applied, and even more appropriately, to the poetic Imagination)--"
5937,CHAPTER XIV,
5938,CHAPTER XIV,"Doubtless this could not be, but that she turns"
5939,CHAPTER XIV,"Bodies to spirit by sublimation strange,"
5940,CHAPTER XIV,"As fire converts to fire the things it burns,"
5941,CHAPTER XIV,As we our food into our nature change.
5942,CHAPTER XIV,
5943,CHAPTER XIV,"From their gross matter she abstracts their forms,"
5944,CHAPTER XIV,And draws a kind of quintessence from things;
5945,CHAPTER XIV,Which to her proper nature she transforms
5946,CHAPTER XIV,To bear them light on her celestial wings.
5947,CHAPTER XIV,
5948,CHAPTER XIV,"Thus does she, when from individual states"
5949,CHAPTER XIV,She doth abstract the universal kinds;
5950,CHAPTER XIV,Which then re-clothed in divers names and fates
5951,CHAPTER XIV,Steal access through the senses to our minds.

5970,CHAPTER XV,as distinguished from general talent determined to poetic composition
5971,CHAPTER XV,"by accidental motives, by an act of the will, rather than by the"
5972,CHAPTER XV,"inspiration of a genial and productive nature. In this investigation, I"

5975,CHAPTER XV,"myriad-minded [61] Shakespeare. I mean the VENUS AND ADONIS, and the"

5978,CHAPTER XV,"abstracted the following marks, as characteristics of original poetic"
5979,CHAPTER XV,genius in general.
5980,CHAPTER XV,
5981,CHAPTER XV,"1. In the VENUS AND ADONIS, the first and most obvious excellence is the"
5982,CHAPTER XV,perfect sweetness of the versification; its adaptation to the subject;
5983,CHAPTER XV,and the power displayed in varying the march of the words without
5984,CHAPTER XV,passing into a loftier and more majestic rhythm than was demanded by the
5985,CHAPTER XV,"thoughts, or permitted by the propriety of preserving a sense of melody"
5986,CHAPTER XV,"predominant. The delight in richness and sweetness of sound, even to"
5987,CHAPTER XV,"a faulty excess, if it be evidently original, and not the result of an"
5988,CHAPTER XV,"easily imitable mechanism, I regard as a highly favourable promise in"
5989,CHAPTER XV,the compositions of a young man. The man that hath not music in his soul
5990,CHAPTER XV,"can indeed never be a genuine poet. Imagery,--(even taken from nature,"
5991,CHAPTER XV,"much more when transplanted from books, as travels, voyages, and works"
5992,CHAPTER XV,"of natural history),--affecting incidents, just thoughts, interesting"
5993,CHAPTER XV,"personal or domestic feelings, and with these the art of their"
5994,CHAPTER XV,"combination or intertexture in the form of a poem,--may all by incessant"
5995,CHAPTER XV,"effort be acquired as a trade, by a man of talent and much reading,"
5996,CHAPTER XV,"who, as I once before observed, has mistaken an intense desire of poetic"
5997,CHAPTER XV,reputation for a natural poetic genius; the love of the arbitrary
5998,CHAPTER XV,end for a possession of the peculiar means. But the sense of musical
5999,CHAPTER XV,"delight, with the power of producing it, is a gift of imagination; and"
6000,CHAPTER XV,"this together with the power of reducing multitude into unity of effect,"
6001,CHAPTER XV,and modifying a series of thoughts by some one predominant thought or
6002,CHAPTER XV,"feeling, may be cultivated and improved, but can never be learned. It is"
6003,CHAPTER XV,in these that “poeta nascitur non fit.”
6004,CHAPTER XV,
6005,CHAPTER XV,2. A second promise of genius is the choice of subjects very remote from
6006,CHAPTER XV,the private interests and circumstances of the writer himself. At least
6007,CHAPTER XV,"I have found, that where the subject is taken immediately from the"
6008,CHAPTER XV,"author’s personal sensations and experiences, the excellence of a"
6009,CHAPTER XV,"particular poem is but an equivocal mark, and often a fallacious"
6010,CHAPTER XV,"pledge, of genuine poetic power. We may perhaps remember the tale of the"
6011,CHAPTER XV,"statuary, who had acquired considerable reputation for the legs of his"
6012,CHAPTER XV,"goddesses, though the rest of the statue accorded but indifferently with"
6013,CHAPTER XV,"ideal beauty; till his wife, elated by her husband’s praises, modestly"
6014,CHAPTER XV,acknowledged that she had been his constant model. In the VENUS
6015,CHAPTER XV,AND ADONIS this proof of poetic power exists even to excess. It is
6016,CHAPTER XV,"throughout as if a superior spirit more intuitive, more intimately"
6017,CHAPTER XV,"conscious, even than the characters themselves, not only of every"
6018,CHAPTER XV,"outward look and act, but of the flux and reflux of the mind in all its"
6019,CHAPTER XV,"subtlest thoughts and feelings, were placing the whole before our view;"
6020,CHAPTER XV,"himself meanwhile unparticipating in the passions, and actuated only"
6021,CHAPTER XV,"by that pleasurable excitement, which had resulted from the energetic"
6022,CHAPTER XV,fervour of his own spirit in so vividly exhibiting what it had
6023,CHAPTER XV,"so accurately and profoundly contemplated. I think, I should have"
6024,CHAPTER XV,"conjectured from these poems, that even then the great instinct, which"
6025,CHAPTER XV,"impelled the poet to the drama, was secretly working in him, prompting"
6026,CHAPTER XV,"him--by a series and never broken chain of imagery, always vivid and,"
6027,CHAPTER XV,"because unbroken, often minute; by the highest effort of the picturesque"
6028,CHAPTER XV,"in words, of which words are capable, higher perhaps than was ever"
6029,CHAPTER XV,"realized by any other poet, even Dante not excepted; to provide a"
6030,CHAPTER XV,"substitute for that visual language, that constant intervention and"
6031,CHAPTER XV,"running comment by tone, look and gesture, which in his dramatic works"
6032,CHAPTER XV,he was entitled to expect from the players. His Venus and Adonis seem
6033,CHAPTER XV,"at once the characters themselves, and the whole representation of those"
6034,CHAPTER XV,"characters by the most consummate actors. You seem to be told nothing,"
6035,CHAPTER XV,"but to see and hear everything. Hence it is, from the perpetual activity"
6036,CHAPTER XV,"of attention required on the part of the reader; from the rapid flow,"
6037,CHAPTER XV,"the quick change, and the playful nature of the thoughts and images; and"
6038,CHAPTER XV,"above all from the alienation, and, if I may hazard such an expression,"
6039,CHAPTER XV,"the utter aloofness of the poet’s own feelings, from those of which he"
6040,CHAPTER XV,is at once the painter and the analyst; that though the very subject
6041,CHAPTER XV,"cannot but detract from the pleasure of a delicate mind, yet never was"
6042,CHAPTER XV,"poem less dangerous on a moral account. Instead of doing as Ariosto, and"
6043,CHAPTER XV,"as, still more offensively, Wieland has done, instead of degrading and"
6044,CHAPTER XV,"deforming passion into appetite, the trials of love into the struggles"
6045,CHAPTER XV,of concupiscence; Shakespeare has here represented the animal impulse
6046,CHAPTER XV,"itself, so as to preclude all sympathy with it, by dissipating the"
6047,CHAPTER XV,"reader’s notice among the thousand outward images, and now beautiful,"
6048,CHAPTER XV,"now fanciful circumstances, which form its dresses and its scenery; or"
6049,CHAPTER XV,by diverting our attention from the main subject by those frequent witty
6050,CHAPTER XV,"or profound reflections, which the poet’s ever active mind has deduced"
6051,CHAPTER XV,"from, or connected with, the imagery and the incidents. The reader is"
6052,CHAPTER XV,forced into too much action to sympathize with the merely passive of our
6053,CHAPTER XV,nature. As little can a mind thus roused and awakened be brooded on by
6054,CHAPTER XV,"mean and indistinct emotion, as the low, lazy mist can creep upon the"
6055,CHAPTER XV,"surface of a lake, while a strong gale is driving it onward in waves and"
6056,CHAPTER XV,billows.
6057,CHAPTER XV,
6058,CHAPTER XV,"3. It has been before observed that images, however beautiful, though"
6059,CHAPTER XV,"faithfully copied from nature, and as accurately represented in words,"
6060,CHAPTER XV,do not of themselves characterize the poet. They become proofs of
6061,CHAPTER XV,original genius only as far as they are modified by a predominant
6062,CHAPTER XV,passion; or by associated thoughts or images awakened by that passion;
6063,CHAPTER XV,"or when they have the effect of reducing multitude to unity, or"
6064,CHAPTER XV,"succession to an instant; or lastly, when a human and intellectual life"
6065,CHAPTER XV,"is transferred to them from the poet’s own spirit,"
6066,CHAPTER XV,
6067,CHAPTER XV,"Which shoots its being through earth, sea, and air."
6068,CHAPTER XV,
6069,CHAPTER XV,"In the two following lines for instance, there is nothing objectionable,"
6070,CHAPTER XV,"nothing which would preclude them from forming, in their proper place,"
6071,CHAPTER XV,part of a descriptive poem:
6072,CHAPTER XV,
6073,CHAPTER XV,"Behold yon row of pines, that shorn and bow’d"
6074,CHAPTER XV,"Bend from the sea-blast, seen at twilight eve."
6075,CHAPTER XV,
6076,CHAPTER XV,"But with a small alteration of rhythm, the same words would be equally"
6077,CHAPTER XV,"in their place in a book of topography, or in a descriptive tour. The"
6078,CHAPTER XV,same image will rise into semblance of poetry if thus conveyed:
6079,CHAPTER XV,
6080,CHAPTER XV,"Yon row of bleak and visionary pines,"
6081,CHAPTER XV,"By twilight glimpse discerned, mark! how they flee"
6082,CHAPTER XV,"From the fierce sea-blast, all their tresses wild"
6083,CHAPTER XV,Streaming before them.
6084,CHAPTER XV,
6085,CHAPTER XV,"I have given this as an illustration, by no means as an instance, of"
6086,CHAPTER XV,"that particular excellence which I had in view, and in which Shakespeare"
6087,CHAPTER XV,"even in his earliest, as in his latest, works surpasses all other"
6088,CHAPTER XV,"poets. It is by this, that he still gives a dignity and a passion to"
6089,CHAPTER XV,"the objects which he presents. Unaided by any previous excitement, they"
6090,CHAPTER XV,"burst upon us at once in life and in power,--"
6091,CHAPTER XV,
6092,CHAPTER XV,“Full many a glorious morning have I seen
6093,CHAPTER XV,Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye.”
6094,CHAPTER XV,
6095,CHAPTER XV,"“Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul"
6096,CHAPTER XV,Of the wide world dreaming on things to come--
6097,CHAPTER XV,
6098,CHAPTER XV,*     *     *     *     *     *
6099,CHAPTER XV,*     *     *     *     *     *
6100,CHAPTER XV,
6101,CHAPTER XV,"The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,"
6102,CHAPTER XV,And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
6103,CHAPTER XV,"Incertainties now crown themselves assur’d,"
6104,CHAPTER XV,And Peace proclaims olives of endless age.
6105,CHAPTER XV,Now with the drops of this most balmy time
6106,CHAPTER XV,"My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,"
6107,CHAPTER XV,"Since spite of him, I’ll live in this poor rhyme,"
6108,CHAPTER XV,While he insults o’er dull and speechless tribes.
6109,CHAPTER XV,"And thou in this shalt find thy monument,"
6110,CHAPTER XV,"When tyrants’ crests, and tombs of brass are spent.”"
6111,CHAPTER XV,
6112,CHAPTER XV,"As of higher worth, so doubtless still more characteristic of poetic"
6113,CHAPTER XV,"genius does the imagery become, when it moulds and colours itself to the"
6114,CHAPTER XV,"circumstances, passion, or character, present and foremost in the mind."
6115,CHAPTER XV,"For unrivalled instances of this excellence, the reader’s own memory"
6116,CHAPTER XV,"will refer him to the LEAR, OTHELLO, in short to which not of the"
6117,CHAPTER XV,"“great, ever living, dead man’s” dramatic works? Inopem em copia"
6118,CHAPTER XV,"fecit. How true it is to nature, he has himself finely expressed in the"
6119,CHAPTER XV,instance of love in his 98th Sonnet.
6120,CHAPTER XV,
6121,CHAPTER XV,"From you have I been absent in the spring,"
6122,CHAPTER XV,"When proud-pied April drest in all its trim,"
6123,CHAPTER XV,Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing;
6124,CHAPTER XV,That heavy Saturn laugh’d and leap’d with him.
6125,CHAPTER XV,"Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell"
6126,CHAPTER XV,"Of different flowers in odour and in hue,"
6127,CHAPTER XV,"Could make me any summer’s story tell,"
6128,CHAPTER XV,"Or from their proud lap pluck them, where they grew"
6129,CHAPTER XV,"Nor did I wonder at the lilies white,"
6130,CHAPTER XV,Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
6131,CHAPTER XV,"They were, tho’ sweet, but figures of delight,"
6132,CHAPTER XV,"Drawn after you, you pattern of all those."
6133,CHAPTER XV,"Yet seem’d it winter still, and, you away,"
6134,CHAPTER XV,"As with your shadow, I with these did play!”"
6135,CHAPTER XV,
6136,CHAPTER XV,"Scarcely less sure, or if a less valuable, not less indispensable mark"
6137,CHAPTER XV,
6138,CHAPTER XV,Gonimon men poiaetou------
6139,CHAPTER XV,"------hostis rhaema gennaion lakoi,"
6140,CHAPTER XV,
6141,CHAPTER XV,"will the imagery supply, when, with more than the power of the painter,"
6142,CHAPTER XV,the poet gives us the liveliest image of succession with the feeling of
6143,CHAPTER XV,simultaneousness:--
6144,CHAPTER XV,
6145,CHAPTER XV,"With this, he breaketh from the sweet embrace"
6146,CHAPTER XV,"Of those fair arms, which bound him to her breast,"
6147,CHAPTER XV,And homeward through the dark laund runs apace;--
6148,CHAPTER XV,
6149,CHAPTER XV,*     *     *     *     *     *
6150,CHAPTER XV,
6151,CHAPTER XV,"Look! how a bright star shooteth from the sky,"
6152,CHAPTER XV,So glides he in the night from Venus’ eye.
6153,CHAPTER XV,
6154,CHAPTER XV,"4. The last character I shall mention, which would prove indeed but"
6155,CHAPTER XV,"little, except as taken conjointly with the former;--yet without which"
6156,CHAPTER XV,"the former could scarce exist in a high degree, and (even if this were"
6157,CHAPTER XV,possible) would give promises only of transitory flashes and a meteoric
6158,CHAPTER XV,"power;--is depth, and energy of thought. No man was ever yet a great"
6159,CHAPTER XV,"poet, without being at the same time a profound philosopher. For poetry"
6160,CHAPTER XV,"is the blossom and the fragrancy of all human knowledge, human thoughts,"
6161,CHAPTER XV,"human passions, emotions, language. In Shakespeare’s poems the creative"
6162,CHAPTER XV,power and the intellectual energy wrestle as in a war embrace. Each in
6163,CHAPTER XV,its excess of strength seems to threaten the extinction of the other.
6164,CHAPTER XV,"At length in the drama they were reconciled, and fought each with its"
6165,CHAPTER XV,"shield before the breast of the other. Or like two rapid streams, that,"
6166,CHAPTER XV,"at their first meeting within narrow and rocky banks, mutually strive"
6167,CHAPTER XV,to repel each other and intermix reluctantly and in tumult; but soon
6168,CHAPTER XV,"finding a wider channel and more yielding shores blend, and dilate, and"
6169,CHAPTER XV,flow on in one current and with one voice. The VENUS AND ADONIS did
6170,CHAPTER XV,not perhaps allow the display of the deeper passions. But the story of
6171,CHAPTER XV,Lucretia seems to favour and even demand their intensest workings. And
6172,CHAPTER XV,"yet we find in Shakespeare’s management of the tale neither pathos,"
6173,CHAPTER XV,nor any other dramatic quality. There is the same minute and faithful
6174,CHAPTER XV,"imagery as in the former poem, in the same vivid colours, inspirited by"
6175,CHAPTER XV,"the same impetuous vigour of thought, and diverging and contracting with"
6176,CHAPTER XV,the same activity of the assimilative and of the modifying faculties;
6177,CHAPTER XV,"and with a yet larger display, a yet wider range of knowledge"
6178,CHAPTER XV,"and reflection; and lastly, with the same perfect dominion, often"
6179,CHAPTER XV,"domination, over the whole world of language. What then shall we say?"
6180,CHAPTER XV,"even this; that Shakespeare, no mere child of nature; no automaton of"
6181,CHAPTER XV,"genius; no passive vehicle of inspiration, possessed by the spirit, not"
6182,CHAPTER XV,"possessing it; first studied patiently, meditated deeply, understood"
6183,CHAPTER XV,"minutely, till knowledge, become habitual and intuitive, wedded itself"
6184,CHAPTER XV,"to his habitual feelings, and at length gave birth to that stupendous"
6185,CHAPTER XV,"power, by which he stands alone, with no equal or second in his own"
6186,CHAPTER XV,class; to that power which seated him on one of the two glory-smitten
6187,CHAPTER XV,"summits of the poetic mountain, with Milton as his compeer not rival."
6188,CHAPTER XV,"While the former darts himself forth, and passes into all the forms of"
6189,CHAPTER XV,"human character and passion, the one Proteus of the fire and the flood;"
6190,CHAPTER XV,"the other attracts all forms and things to himself, into the unity of"
6191,CHAPTER XV,his own ideal. All things and modes of action shape themselves anew in
6192,CHAPTER XV,"the being of Milton; while Shakespeare becomes all things, yet for ever"
6193,CHAPTER XV,"remaining himself. O what great men hast thou not produced, England, my"
6194,CHAPTER XV,country!--Truly indeed--
6195,CHAPTER XV,
6196,CHAPTER XV,"We must be free or die, who speak the tongue,"
6197,CHAPTER XV,"Which Shakespeare spake; the faith and morals hold,"
6198,CHAPTER XV,Which Milton held. In everything we are sprung
6199,CHAPTER XV,"Of earth’s first blood, have titles manifold."
6200,CHAPTER XV,

6202,CHAPTER XV,
6203,CHAPTER XV,
6204,CHAPTER XVI,CHAPTER XVI
6205,CHAPTER XVI,
6206,CHAPTER XVI,Striking points of difference between the Poets of the present age and
6207,CHAPTER XVI,those of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries--Wish expressed for the
6208,CHAPTER XVI,union of the characteristic merits of both.
6209,CHAPTER XVI,
6210,CHAPTER XVI,
6211,CHAPTER XVI,"Christendom, from its first settlement on feudal rights, has been so"
6212,CHAPTER XVI,"far one great body, however imperfectly organized, that a similar spirit"
6213,CHAPTER XVI,will be found in each period to have been acting in all its members.
6214,CHAPTER XVI,"The study of Shakespeare’s poems--(I do not include his dramatic works,"
6215,CHAPTER XVI,eminently as they too deserve that title)--led me to a more careful
6216,CHAPTER XVI,examination of the contemporary poets both in England and in other
6217,CHAPTER XVI,"countries. But my attention was especially fixed on those of Italy, from"
6218,CHAPTER XVI,the birth to the death of Shakespeare; that being the country in which
6219,CHAPTER XVI,"the fine arts had been most sedulously, and hitherto most successfully"
6220,CHAPTER XVI,cultivated. Abstracted from the degrees and peculiarities of individual
6221,CHAPTER XVI,"genius, the properties common to the good writers of each period seem"
6222,CHAPTER XVI,to establish one striking point of difference between the poetry of
6223,CHAPTER XVI,"the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and that of the present age. The"
6224,CHAPTER XVI,remark may perhaps be extended to the sister art of painting. At least
6225,CHAPTER XVI,the latter will serve to illustrate the former. In the present age the
6226,CHAPTER XVI,"poet--(I would wish to be understood as speaking generally, and without"
6227,CHAPTER XVI,allusion to individual names)--seems to propose to himself as his main
6228,CHAPTER XVI,"object, and as that which is the most characteristic of his art, new and"
6229,CHAPTER XVI,striking images; with incidents that interest the affections or excite
6230,CHAPTER XVI,"the curiosity. Both his characters and his descriptions he renders,"
6231,CHAPTER XVI,"as much as possible, specific and individual, even to a degree of"
6232,CHAPTER XVI,"portraiture. In his diction and metre, on the other hand, he is"
6233,CHAPTER XVI,comparatively careless. The measure is either constructed on no previous
6234,CHAPTER XVI,"system, and acknowledges no justifying principle but that of the"
6235,CHAPTER XVI,"writer’s convenience; or else some mechanical movement is adopted, of"
6236,CHAPTER XVI,"which one couplet or stanza is so far an adequate specimen, as that the"
6237,CHAPTER XVI,"occasional differences appear evidently to arise from accident, or the"
6238,CHAPTER XVI,"qualities of the language itself, not from meditation and an intelligent"
6239,CHAPTER XVI,"purpose. And the language from Pope’s translation of Homer, to Darwin’s"
6240,CHAPTER XVI,"Temple of Nature [62], may, notwithstanding some illustrious exceptions,"
6241,CHAPTER XVI,"be too faithfully characterized, as claiming to be poetical for no"
6242,CHAPTER XVI,"better reason, than that it would be intolerable in conversation or in"
6243,CHAPTER XVI,"prose. Though alas! even our prose writings, nay even the style of our"
6244,CHAPTER XVI,"more set discourses, strive to be in the fashion, and trick themselves"
6245,CHAPTER XVI,out in the soiled and over-worn finery of the meretricious muse. It is
6246,CHAPTER XVI,true that of late a great improvement in this respect is observable in
6247,CHAPTER XVI,"our most popular writers. But it is equally true, that this recurrence"
6248,CHAPTER XVI,to plain sense and genuine mother English is far from being general; and
6249,CHAPTER XVI,"that the composition of our novels, magazines, public harangues, and the"
6250,CHAPTER XVI,"like is commonly as trivial in thought, and yet enigmatic in expression,"
6251,CHAPTER XVI,as if Echo and Sphinx had laid their heads together to construct it.
6252,CHAPTER XVI,"Nay, even of those who have most rescued themselves from this contagion,"
6253,CHAPTER XVI,"I should plead inwardly guilty to the charge of duplicity or cowardice,"
6254,CHAPTER XVI,"if I withheld my conviction, that few have guarded the purity of their"
6255,CHAPTER XVI,"native tongue with that jealous care, which the sublime Dante in his"
6256,CHAPTER XVI,"tract De la volgare Eloquenza, declares to be the first duty of a poet."
6257,CHAPTER XVI,For language is the armoury of the human mind; and at once contains
6258,CHAPTER XVI,"the trophies of its past, and the weapons of its future conquests."
6259,CHAPTER XVI,"Animadverte, says Hobbes, quam sit ab improprietate verborum pronum"
6260,CHAPTER XVI,"hominihus prolabi in errores circa ipsas res! Sat [vero], says"
6261,CHAPTER XVI,"Sennertus, in hac vitae brevitate et naturae obscuritate, rerum est,"
6262,CHAPTER XVI,"quibus cognoscendis tempus impendatur, ut [confusis et multivotis]"
6263,CHAPTER XVI,sermonibus intelligendis illud consumere opus non sit. [Eheu! quantas
6264,CHAPTER XVI,"strages paravere verba nubila, quae tot dicunt ut nihil dicunt;--nubes"

6274,CHAPTER XVI,ut patriae vivat.
6275,CHAPTER XVI,
6276,CHAPTER XVI,Something analogous to the materials and structure of modern poetry I
6277,CHAPTER XVI,seem to have noticed--(but here I beg to be understood as speaking
6278,CHAPTER XVI,with the utmost diffidence)--in our common landscape painters. Their
6279,CHAPTER XVI,foregrounds and intermediate distances are comparatively unattractive:
6280,CHAPTER XVI,"while the main interest of the landscape is thrown into the background,"
6281,CHAPTER XVI,"where mountains and torrents and castles forbid the eye to proceed, and"
6282,CHAPTER XVI,nothing tempts it to trace its way back again. But in the works of the
6283,CHAPTER XVI,"great Italian and Flemish masters, the front and middle objects of the"
6284,CHAPTER XVI,"landscape are the most obvious and determinate, the interest gradually"
6285,CHAPTER XVI,"dies away in the background, and the charm and peculiar worth of the"
6286,CHAPTER XVI,"picture consists, not so much in the specific objects which it conveys"
6287,CHAPTER XVI,to the understanding in a visual language formed by the substitution of
6288,CHAPTER XVI,"figures for words, as in the beauty and harmony of the colours, lines,"
6289,CHAPTER XVI,"and expression, with which the objects are represented. Hence novelty of"
6290,CHAPTER XVI,subject was rather avoided than sought for. Superior excellence in
6291,CHAPTER XVI,the manner of treating the same subjects was the trial and test of the
6292,CHAPTER XVI,artist’s merit.
6293,CHAPTER XVI,
6294,CHAPTER XVI,Not otherwise is it with the more polished poets of the fifteenth and
6295,CHAPTER XVI,"sixteenth centuries, especially those of Italy. The imagery is almost"
6296,CHAPTER XVI,"always general: sun, moon, flowers, breezes, murmuring streams, warbling"
6297,CHAPTER XVI,"songsters, delicious shades, lovely damsels cruel as fair, nymphs,"
6298,CHAPTER XVI,"naiads, and goddesses, are the materials which are common to all, and"
6299,CHAPTER XVI,"which each shaped and arranged according to his judgment or fancy,"
6300,CHAPTER XVI,little solicitous to add or to particularize. If we make an honourable
6301,CHAPTER XVI,"exception in favour of some English poets, the thoughts too are as"
6302,CHAPTER XVI,"little novel as the images; and the fable of their narrative poems,"
6303,CHAPTER XVI,"for the most part drawn from mythology, or sources of equal notoriety,"
6304,CHAPTER XVI,derive their chief attractions from the manner of treating them; from
6305,CHAPTER XVI,"impassioned flow, or picturesque arrangement. In opposition to the"
6306,CHAPTER XVI,"present age, and perhaps in as faulty an extreme, they placed the"
6307,CHAPTER XVI,"essence of poetry in the art. The excellence, at which they aimed,"
6308,CHAPTER XVI,"consisted in the exquisite polish of the diction, combined with perfect"
6309,CHAPTER XVI,simplicity. This their prime object they attained by the avoidance of
6310,CHAPTER XVI,"every word, which a gentleman would not use in dignified conversation,"
6311,CHAPTER XVI,"and of every word and phrase, which none but a learned man would use;"
6312,CHAPTER XVI,"by the studied position of words and phrases, so that not only each"
6313,CHAPTER XVI,"part should be melodious in itself, but contribute to the harmony of"
6314,CHAPTER XVI,"the whole, each note referring and conducting to the melody of all the"
6315,CHAPTER XVI,foregoing and following words of the same period or stanza; and lastly
6316,CHAPTER XVI,"with equal labour, the greater because unbetrayed, by the variation and"
6317,CHAPTER XVI,"various harmonies of their metrical movement. Their measures, however,"
6318,CHAPTER XVI,"were not indebted for their variety to the introduction of new metres,"
6319,CHAPTER XVI,"such as have been attempted of late in the Alonzo and Imogen, and others"
6320,CHAPTER XVI,"borrowed from the German, having in their very mechanism a specific"
6321,CHAPTER XVI,"overpowering tune, to which the generous reader humours his voice and"
6322,CHAPTER XVI,"emphasis, with more indulgence to the author than attention to the"
6323,CHAPTER XVI,"meaning or quantity of the words; but which, to an ear familiar with the"
6324,CHAPTER XVI,"numerous sounds of the Greek and Roman poets, has an effect not unlike"
6325,CHAPTER XVI,that of galloping over a paved road in a German stage-waggon without
6326,CHAPTER XVI,"springs. On the contrary, the elder bards both of Italy and England"
6327,CHAPTER XVI,produced a far greater as well as more charming variety by countless
6328,CHAPTER XVI,"modifications, and subtle balances of sound in the common metres of"
6329,CHAPTER XVI,their country. A lasting and enviable reputation awaits that man of
6330,CHAPTER XVI,"genius, who should attempt and realize a union;--who should recall the"
6331,CHAPTER XVI,"high finish, the appropriateness, the facility, the delicate proportion,"
6332,CHAPTER XVI,"and above all, the perfusive and omnipresent grace, which have"
6333,CHAPTER XVI,"preserved, as in a shrine of precious amber, the Sparrow of Catullus,"
6334,CHAPTER XVI,"the Swallow, the Grasshopper, and all the other little loves of"
6335,CHAPTER XVI,"Anacreon; and which, with bright, though diminished glories, revisited"
6336,CHAPTER XVI,"the youth and early manhood of Christian Europe, in the vales of [63]"
6337,CHAPTER XVI,"Arno, and the groves of Isis and of Cam; and who with these should"
6338,CHAPTER XVI,"combine the keener interest, deeper pathos, manlier reflection, and the"
6339,CHAPTER XVI,"fresher and more various imagery, which give a value and a name that"
6340,CHAPTER XVI,"will not pass away to the poets who have done honour to our own times,"
6341,CHAPTER XVI,and to those of our immediate predecessors.

6349,CHAPTER XVII,"all, low and rustic life) especially unfavourable to the formation of a"
6350,CHAPTER XVII,"human diction--The best parts of language the product of philosophers,"
6351,CHAPTER XVII,not of clowns or shepherds--Poetry essentially ideal and generic--The
6352,CHAPTER XVII,"language of Milton as much the language of real life, yea, incomparably"
6353,CHAPTER XVII,more so than that of the cottager.

6356,CHAPTER XVII,"As far then as Mr. Wordsworth in his preface contended, and most ably"
6357,CHAPTER XVII,"contended, for a reformation in our poetic diction, as far as he has"
6358,CHAPTER XVII,"evinced the truth of passion, and the dramatic propriety of those"
6359,CHAPTER XVII,"figures and metaphors in the original poets, which, stripped of their"
6360,CHAPTER XVII,"justifying reasons, and converted into mere artifices of connection or"
6361,CHAPTER XVII,"ornament, constitute the characteristic falsity in the poetic style of"
6362,CHAPTER XVII,"the moderns; and as far as he has, with equal acuteness and clearness,"
6363,CHAPTER XVII,"pointed out the process by which this change was effected, and the"
6364,CHAPTER XVII,resemblances between that state into which the reader’s mind is thrown
6365,CHAPTER XVII,by the pleasurable confusion of thought from an unaccustomed train
6366,CHAPTER XVII,of words and images; and that state which is induced by the natural
6367,CHAPTER XVII,"language of impassioned feeling; he undertook a useful task, and"
6368,CHAPTER XVII,"deserves all praise, both for the attempt and for the execution. The"
6369,CHAPTER XVII,provocations to this remonstrance in behalf of truth and nature were
6370,CHAPTER XVII,still of perpetual recurrence before and after the publication of this
6371,CHAPTER XVII,"preface. I cannot likewise but add, that the comparison of such poems"
6372,CHAPTER XVII,"of merit, as have been given to the public within the last ten or twelve"
6373,CHAPTER XVII,"years, with the majority of those produced previously to the appearance"
6374,CHAPTER XVII,"of that preface, leave no doubt on my mind, that Mr. Wordsworth is fully"
6375,CHAPTER XVII,justified in believing his efforts to have been by no means ineffectual.
6376,CHAPTER XVII,Not only in the verses of those who have professed their admiration
6377,CHAPTER XVII,"of his genius, but even of those who have distinguished themselves"
6378,CHAPTER XVII,"by hostility to his theory, and depreciation of his writings, are the"
6379,CHAPTER XVII,"impressions of his principles plainly visible. It is possible, that with"
6380,CHAPTER XVII,"these principles others may have been blended, which are not equally"
6381,CHAPTER XVII,evident; and some which are unsteady and subvertible from the narrowness
6382,CHAPTER XVII,"or imperfection of their basis. But it is more than possible, that"
6383,CHAPTER XVII,"these errors of defect or exaggeration, by kindling and feeding the"
6384,CHAPTER XVII,"controversy, may have conduced not only to the wider propagation of the"
6385,CHAPTER XVII,"accompanying truths, but that, by their frequent presentation to the"
6386,CHAPTER XVII,"mind in an excited state, they may have won for them a more permanent"
6387,CHAPTER XVII,and practical result. A man will borrow a part from his opponent the
6388,CHAPTER XVII,"more easily, if he feels himself justified in continuing to reject a"
6389,CHAPTER XVII,part. While there remain important points in which he can still feel
6390,CHAPTER XVII,"himself in the right, in which he still finds firm footing for continued"
6391,CHAPTER XVII,"resistance, he will gradually adopt those opinions, which were the least"
6392,CHAPTER XVII,"remote from his own convictions, as not less congruous with his own"
6393,CHAPTER XVII,theory than with that which he reprobates. In like manner with a kind of
6394,CHAPTER XVII,"instinctive prudence, he will abandon by little and little his weakest"
6395,CHAPTER XVII,"posts, till at length he seems to forget that they had ever belonged"
6396,CHAPTER XVII,"to him, or affects to consider them at most as accidental and “petty"
6397,CHAPTER XVII,"annexments,” the removal of which leaves the citadel unhurt and"
6398,CHAPTER XVII,unendangered.
6399,CHAPTER XVII,
6400,CHAPTER XVII,My own differences from certain supposed parts of Mr. Wordsworth’s
6401,CHAPTER XVII,"theory ground themselves on the assumption, that his words had been"
6402,CHAPTER XVII,"rightly interpreted, as purporting that the proper diction for poetry"
6403,CHAPTER XVII,"in general consists altogether in a language taken, with due exceptions,"
6404,CHAPTER XVII,"from the mouths of men in real life, a language which actually"
6405,CHAPTER XVII,constitutes the natural conversation of men under the influence of
6406,CHAPTER XVII,"natural feelings. My objection is, first, that in any sense this rule"
6407,CHAPTER XVII,"is applicable only to certain classes of poetry; secondly, that even"
6408,CHAPTER XVII,"to these classes it is not applicable, except in such a sense, as"
6409,CHAPTER XVII,"hath never by any one (as far as I know or have read,) been denied or"
6410,CHAPTER XVII,"doubted; and lastly, that as far as, and in that degree in which it"
6411,CHAPTER XVII,"is practicable, it is yet as a rule useless, if not injurious, and"
6412,CHAPTER XVII,"therefore either need not, or ought not to be practised. The poet"
6413,CHAPTER XVII,"informs his reader, that he had generally chosen low and rustic life;"
6414,CHAPTER XVII,"but not as low and rustic, or in order to repeat that pleasure of"
6415,CHAPTER XVII,"doubtful moral effect, which persons of elevated rank and of superior"
6416,CHAPTER XVII,refinement oftentimes derive from a happy imitation of the rude
6417,CHAPTER XVII,unpolished manners and discourse of their inferiors. For the pleasure
6418,CHAPTER XVII,so derived may be traced to three exciting causes. The first is the
6419,CHAPTER XVII,"naturalness, in fact, of the things represented. The second is the"
6420,CHAPTER XVII,"apparent naturalness of the representation, as raised and qualified"
6421,CHAPTER XVII,"by an imperceptible infusion of the author’s own knowledge and talent,"
6422,CHAPTER XVII,"which infusion does, indeed, constitute it an imitation as distinguished"
6423,CHAPTER XVII,from a mere copy. The third cause may be found in the reader’s conscious
6424,CHAPTER XVII,feeling of his superiority awakened by the contrast presented to
6425,CHAPTER XVII,him; even as for the same purpose the kings and great barons of yore
6426,CHAPTER XVII,"retained, sometimes actual clowns and fools, but more frequently shrewd"
6427,CHAPTER XVII,"and witty fellows in that character. These, however, were not Mr."
6428,CHAPTER XVII,"Wordsworth’s objects. He chose low and rustic life, “because in that"
6429,CHAPTER XVII,"condition the essential passions of the heart find a better soil, in"
6430,CHAPTER XVII,"which they can attain their maturity, are less under restraint, and"
6431,CHAPTER XVII,speak a plainer and more emphatic language; because in that condition of
6432,CHAPTER XVII,"life our elementary feelings coexist in a state of greater simplicity,"
6433,CHAPTER XVII,"and consequently may be more accurately contemplated, and more forcibly"
6434,CHAPTER XVII,communicated; because the manners of rural life germinate from
6435,CHAPTER XVII,those elementary feelings; and from the necessary character of rural
6436,CHAPTER XVII,"occupations are more easily comprehended, and are more durable; and"
6437,CHAPTER XVII,"lastly, because in that condition the passions of men are incorporated"
6438,CHAPTER XVII,with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature.”
6439,CHAPTER XVII,
6440,CHAPTER XVII,"Now it is clear to me, that in the most interesting of the poems, in"
6441,CHAPTER XVII,"which the author is more or less dramatic, as THE BROTHERS, MICHAEL,"
6442,CHAPTER XVII,"RUTH, THE MAD MOTHER, and others, the persons introduced are by no"
6443,CHAPTER XVII,means taken from low or rustic life in the common acceptation of those
6444,CHAPTER XVII,"words! and it is not less clear, that the sentiments and language, as"
6445,CHAPTER XVII,far as they can be conceived to have been really transferred from the
6446,CHAPTER XVII,"minds and conversation of such persons, are attributable to causes and"
6447,CHAPTER XVII,circumstances not necessarily connected with “their occupations and
6448,CHAPTER XVII,"abode.” The thoughts, feelings, language, and manners of the"
6449,CHAPTER XVII,"shepherd-farmers in the vales of Cumberland and Westmoreland, as far as"
6450,CHAPTER XVII,"they are actually adopted in those poems, may be accounted for from"
6451,CHAPTER XVII,"causes, which will and do produce the same results in every state of"
6452,CHAPTER XVII,"life, whether in town or country. As the two principal I rank that"
6453,CHAPTER XVII,"independence, which raises a man above servitude, or daily toil for the"
6454,CHAPTER XVII,"profit of others, yet not above the necessity of industry and a frugal"
6455,CHAPTER XVII,"simplicity of domestic life; and the accompanying unambitious, but"
6456,CHAPTER XVII,"solid and religious, education, which has rendered few books familiar,"
6457,CHAPTER XVII,"but the Bible, and the Liturgy or Hymn book. To this latter cause,"
6458,CHAPTER XVII,"indeed, which is so far accidental, that it is the blessing of"
6459,CHAPTER XVII,"particular countries and a particular age, not the product of"
6460,CHAPTER XVII,"particular places or employments, the poet owes the show of"
6461,CHAPTER XVII,"probability, that his personages might really feel, think, and talk"
6462,CHAPTER XVII,with any tolerable resemblance to his representation. It is an
6463,CHAPTER XVII,"excellent remark of Dr. Henry More’s, that “a man of confined"
6464,CHAPTER XVII,"education, but of good parts, by constant reading of the Bible will"
6465,CHAPTER XVII,naturally form a more winning and commanding rhetoric than those that
6466,CHAPTER XVII,are learned: the intermixture of tongues and of artificial phrases
6467,CHAPTER XVII,debasing their style.”
6468,CHAPTER XVII,
6469,CHAPTER XVII,"It is, moreover, to be considered that to the formation of healthy"
6470,CHAPTER XVII,"feelings, and a reflecting mind, negations involve impediments not less"
6471,CHAPTER XVII,formidable than sophistication and vicious intermixture. I am
6472,CHAPTER XVII,"convinced, that for the human soul to prosper in rustic life a certain"
6473,CHAPTER XVII,vantage-ground is prerequisite. It is not every man that is likely to
6474,CHAPTER XVII,"be improved by a country life or by country labours. Education, or"
6475,CHAPTER XVII,"original sensibility, or both, must pre-exist, if the changes, forms,"
6476,CHAPTER XVII,and incidents of nature are to prove a sufficient stimulant. And where
6477,CHAPTER XVII,"these are not sufficient, the mind contracts and hardens by want of"
6478,CHAPTER XVII,"stimulants: and the man becomes selfish, sensual, gross, and"
6479,CHAPTER XVII,"hard-hearted. Let the management of the Poor Laws in Liverpool,"
6480,CHAPTER XVII,"Manchester, or Bristol be compared with the ordinary dispensation of"
6481,CHAPTER XVII,"the poor rates in agricultural villages, where the farmers are the"
6482,CHAPTER XVII,overseers and guardians of the poor. If my own experience have not been
6483,CHAPTER XVII,"particularly unfortunate, as well as that of the many respectable"
6484,CHAPTER XVII,"country clergymen with whom I have conversed on the subject, the result"
6485,CHAPTER XVII,would engender more than scepticism concerning the desirable influences
6486,CHAPTER XVII,of low and rustic life in and for itself. Whatever may be concluded on
6487,CHAPTER XVII,"the other side, from the stronger local attachments and enterprising"
6488,CHAPTER XVII,"spirit of the Swiss, and other mountaineers, applies to a particular"
6489,CHAPTER XVII,"mode of pastoral life, under forms of property that permit and beget"
6490,CHAPTER XVII,"manners truly republican, not to rustic life in general, or to the"
6491,CHAPTER XVII,"absence of artificial cultivation. On the contrary the mountaineers,"
6492,CHAPTER XVII,"whose manners have been so often eulogized, are in general better"
6493,CHAPTER XVII,educated and greater readers than men of equal rank elsewhere. But
6494,CHAPTER XVII,"where this is not the case, as among the peasantry of North Wales, the"
6495,CHAPTER XVII,"ancient mountains, with all their terrors and all their glories, are"
6496,CHAPTER XVII,"pictures to the blind, and music to the deaf."
6497,CHAPTER XVII,
6498,CHAPTER XVII,"I should not have entered so much into detail upon this passage,"
6499,CHAPTER XVII,"but here seems to be the point, to which all the lines of difference"
6500,CHAPTER XVII,"converge as to their source and centre;--I mean, as far as, and in"
6501,CHAPTER XVII,"whatever respect, my poetic creed does differ from the doctrines"
6502,CHAPTER XVII,"promulgated in this preface. I adopt with full faith, the principle of"
6503,CHAPTER XVII,"Aristotle, that poetry, as poetry, is essentially ideal, that it avoids"
6504,CHAPTER XVII,"and excludes all accident; that its apparent individualities of rank,"
6505,CHAPTER XVII,"character, or occupation must be representative of a class; and that"
6506,CHAPTER XVII,"the persons of poetry must be clothed with generic attributes, with the"
6507,CHAPTER XVII,common attributes of the class: not with such as one gifted individual
6508,CHAPTER XVII,"might possibly possess, but such as from his situation it is most"
6509,CHAPTER XVII,probable before-hand that he would possess. If my premises are right and
6510,CHAPTER XVII,"my deductions legitimate, it follows that there can be no poetic medium"
6511,CHAPTER XVII,between the swains of Theocritus and those of an imaginary golden age.
6512,CHAPTER XVII,
6513,CHAPTER XVII,The characters of the vicar and the shepherd-mariner in the poem of THE
6514,CHAPTER XVII,"BROTHERS, and that of the shepherd of Green-head Ghyll in the MICHAEL,"
6515,CHAPTER XVII,"have all the verisimilitude and representative quality, that the"
6516,CHAPTER XVII,purposes of poetry can require. They are persons of a known and
6517,CHAPTER XVII,"abiding class, and their manners and sentiments the natural product of"
6518,CHAPTER XVII,circumstances common to the class. Take Michael for instance:
6519,CHAPTER XVII,
6520,CHAPTER XVII,"An old man stout of heart, and strong of limb."
6521,CHAPTER XVII,His bodily frame had been from youth to age
6522,CHAPTER XVII,"Of an unusual strength: his mind was keen,"
6523,CHAPTER XVII,"Intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs,"
6524,CHAPTER XVII,And in his shepherd’s calling he was prompt
6525,CHAPTER XVII,And watchful more than ordinary men.
6526,CHAPTER XVII,"Hence he had learned the meaning of all winds,"
6527,CHAPTER XVII,Of blasts of every tone; and oftentimes
6528,CHAPTER XVII,"When others heeded not, He heard the South"
6529,CHAPTER XVII,"Make subterraneous music, like the noise"
6530,CHAPTER XVII,Of bagpipers on distant Highland hills.
6531,CHAPTER XVII,"The Shepherd, at such warning, of his flock"
6532,CHAPTER XVII,"Bethought him, and he to himself would say,"
6533,CHAPTER XVII,‘The winds are now devising work for me!’
6534,CHAPTER XVII,"And truly, at all times, the storm, that drives"
6535,CHAPTER XVII,"The traveller to a shelter, summoned him"
6536,CHAPTER XVII,Up to the mountains: he had been alone
6537,CHAPTER XVII,"Amid the heart of many thousand mists,"
6538,CHAPTER XVII,That came to him and left him on the heights.
6539,CHAPTER XVII,"So lived he, until his eightieth year was past."
6540,CHAPTER XVII,"And grossly that man errs, who should suppose"
6541,CHAPTER XVII,"That the green valleys, and the streams and rocks,"
6542,CHAPTER XVII,Were things indifferent to the Shepherd’s thoughts.
6543,CHAPTER XVII,"Fields, where with cheerful spirits he had breathed"
6544,CHAPTER XVII,"The common air; the hills, which he so oft"
6545,CHAPTER XVII,Had climbed with vigorous steps; which had impressed
6546,CHAPTER XVII,So many incidents upon his mind
6547,CHAPTER XVII,"Of hardship, skill or courage, joy or fear;"
6548,CHAPTER XVII,"Which, like a book, preserved the memory"
6549,CHAPTER XVII,"Of the dumb animals, whom he had saved,"
6550,CHAPTER XVII,"Had fed or sheltered, linking to such acts,"
6551,CHAPTER XVII,"So grateful in themselves, the certainty"
6552,CHAPTER XVII,"Of honourable gain; these fields, these hills"
6553,CHAPTER XVII,"Which were his living Being, even more"
6554,CHAPTER XVII,Than his own blood--what could they less? had laid
6555,CHAPTER XVII,"Strong hold on his affections, were to him"
6556,CHAPTER XVII,"A pleasurable feeling of blind love,"
6557,CHAPTER XVII,The pleasure which there is in life itself.
6558,CHAPTER XVII,
6559,CHAPTER XVII,"On the other hand, in the poems which are pitched in a lower key, as the"
6560,CHAPTER XVII,"HARRY GILL, and THE IDIOT BOY, the feelings are those of human nature in"
6561,CHAPTER XVII,"general; though the poet has judiciously laid the scene in the country,"
6562,CHAPTER XVII,"in order to place himself in the vicinity of interesting images, without"
6563,CHAPTER XVII,the necessity of ascribing a sentimental perception of their beauty
6564,CHAPTER XVII,"to the persons of his drama. In THE IDIOT BOY, indeed, the mother’s"
6565,CHAPTER XVII,character is not so much the real and native product of a “situation
6566,CHAPTER XVII,"where the essential passions of the heart find a better soil, in which"
6567,CHAPTER XVII,they can attain their maturity and speak a plainer and more emphatic
6568,CHAPTER XVII,"language,” as it is an impersonation of an instinct abandoned by"
6569,CHAPTER XVII,judgment. Hence the two following charges seem to me not wholly
6570,CHAPTER XVII,"groundless: at least, they are the only plausible objections, which I"
6571,CHAPTER XVII,"have heard to that fine poem. The one is, that the author has not, in"
6572,CHAPTER XVII,"the poem itself, taken sufficient care to preclude from the reader’s"
6573,CHAPTER XVII,"fancy the disgusting images of ordinary morbid idiocy, which yet it was"
6574,CHAPTER XVII,"by no means his intention to represent. He was even by the “burr, burr,"
6575,CHAPTER XVII,"burr,” uncounteracted by any preceding description of the boy’s beauty,"
6576,CHAPTER XVII,"assisted in recalling them. The other is, that the idiocy of the boy"
6577,CHAPTER XVII,"is so evenly balanced by the folly of the mother, as to present to the"
6578,CHAPTER XVII,general reader rather a laughable burlesque on the blindness of anile
6579,CHAPTER XVII,"dotage, than an analytic display of maternal affection in its ordinary"
6580,CHAPTER XVII,workings.
6581,CHAPTER XVII,
6582,CHAPTER XVII,"In THE THORN, the poet himself acknowledges in a note the necessity of"
6583,CHAPTER XVII,"an introductory poem, in which he should have portrayed the character"
6584,CHAPTER XVII,of the person from whom the words of the poem are supposed to proceed:
6585,CHAPTER XVII,"a superstitious man moderately imaginative, of slow faculties and deep"
6586,CHAPTER XVII,"feelings, “a captain of a small trading vessel, for example, who, being"
6587,CHAPTER XVII,"past the middle age of life, had retired upon an annuity, or small"
6588,CHAPTER XVII,"independent income, to some village or country town of which he was"
6589,CHAPTER XVII,"not a native, or in which he had not been accustomed to live. Such men"
6590,CHAPTER XVII,having nothing to do become credulous and talkative from indolence.” But
6591,CHAPTER XVII,"in a poem, still more in a lyric poem--and the Nurse in ROMEO AND JULIET"
6592,CHAPTER XVII,"alone prevents me from extending the remark even to dramatic poetry, if"
6593,CHAPTER XVII,indeed even the Nurse can be deemed altogether a case in point--it is
6594,CHAPTER XVII,"not possible to imitate truly a dull and garrulous discourser, without"
6595,CHAPTER XVII,"repeating the effects of dullness and garrulity. However this may be, I"
6596,CHAPTER XVII,"dare assert, that the parts--(and these form the far larger portion of"
6597,CHAPTER XVII,the whole)--which might as well or still better have proceeded from the
6598,CHAPTER XVII,"poet’s own imagination, and have been spoken in his own character,"
6599,CHAPTER XVII,"are those which have given, and which will continue to give, universal"
6600,CHAPTER XVII,delight; and that the passages exclusively appropriate to the supposed
6601,CHAPTER XVII,"narrator, such as the last couplet of the third stanza [64]; the seven"
6602,CHAPTER XVII,"last lines of the tenth [65]; and the five following stanzas, with"
6603,CHAPTER XVII,the exception of the four admirable lines at the commencement of the
6604,CHAPTER XVII,"fourteenth, are felt by many unprejudiced and unsophisticated hearts,"
6605,CHAPTER XVII,as sudden and unpleasant sinkings from the height to which the poet had
6606,CHAPTER XVII,"previously lifted them, and to which he again re-elevates both himself"
6607,CHAPTER XVII,and his reader.
6608,CHAPTER XVII,
6609,CHAPTER XVII,"If then I am compelled to doubt the theory, by which the choice of"
6610,CHAPTER XVII,"characters was to be directed, not only a priori, from grounds of"
6611,CHAPTER XVII,"reason, but both from the few instances in which the poet himself"
6612,CHAPTER XVII,"need be supposed to have been governed by it, and from the comparative"
6613,CHAPTER XVII,inferiority of those instances; still more must I hesitate in my assent
6614,CHAPTER XVII,to the sentence which immediately follows the former citation; and
6615,CHAPTER XVII,"which I can neither admit as particular fact, nor as general rule. “The"
6616,CHAPTER XVII,"language, too, of these men has been adopted (purified indeed from what"
6617,CHAPTER XVII,"appear to be its real defects, from all lasting and rational causes of"
6618,CHAPTER XVII,dislike or disgust) because such men hourly communicate with the best
6619,CHAPTER XVII,objects from which the best part of language is originally derived; and
6620,CHAPTER XVII,"because, from their rank in society and the sameness and narrow circle"
6621,CHAPTER XVII,"of their intercourse, being less under the action of social vanity,"
6622,CHAPTER XVII,they convey their feelings and notions in simple and unelaborated
6623,CHAPTER XVII,"expressions.” To this I reply; that a rustic’s language, purified from"
6624,CHAPTER XVII,"all provincialism and grossness, and so far reconstructed as to be made"
6625,CHAPTER XVII,consistent with the rules of grammar--(which are in essence no
6626,CHAPTER XVII,"other than the laws of universal logic, applied to psychological"
6627,CHAPTER XVII,materials)--will not differ from the language of any other man of
6628,CHAPTER XVII,"common sense, however learned or refined he may be, except as far as"
6629,CHAPTER XVII,"the notions, which the rustic has to convey, are fewer and more"
6630,CHAPTER XVII,"indiscriminate. This will become still clearer, if we add the"
6631,CHAPTER XVII,"consideration--(equally important though less obvious)--that the rustic,"
6632,CHAPTER XVII,"from the more imperfect development of his faculties, and from the"
6633,CHAPTER XVII,"lower state of their cultivation, aims almost solely to convey insulated"
6634,CHAPTER XVII,"facts, either those of his scanty experience or his traditional belief;"
6635,CHAPTER XVII,while the educated man chiefly seeks to discover and express those
6636,CHAPTER XVII,"connections of things, or those relative bearings of fact to fact, from"
6637,CHAPTER XVII,which some more or less general law is deducible. For facts are valuable
6638,CHAPTER XVII,"to a wise man, chiefly as they lead to the discovery of the indwelling"
6639,CHAPTER XVII,"law, which is the true being of things, the sole solution of their modes"
6640,CHAPTER XVII,"of existence, and in the knowledge of which consists our dignity and our"
6641,CHAPTER XVII,power.
6642,CHAPTER XVII,
6643,CHAPTER XVII,"As little can I agree with the assertion, that from the objects with"
6644,CHAPTER XVII,which the rustic hourly communicates the best part of language is
6645,CHAPTER XVII,"formed. For first, if to communicate with an object implies such an"
6646,CHAPTER XVII,"acquaintance with it, as renders it capable of being discriminately"
6647,CHAPTER XVII,"reflected on, the distinct knowledge of an uneducated rustic would"
6648,CHAPTER XVII,furnish a very scanty vocabulary. The few things and modes of action
6649,CHAPTER XVII,requisite for his bodily conveniences would alone be individualized;
6650,CHAPTER XVII,while all the rest of nature would be expressed by a small number of
6651,CHAPTER XVII,"confused general terms. Secondly, I deny that the words and combinations"
6652,CHAPTER XVII,"of words derived from the objects, with which the rustic is familiar,"
6653,CHAPTER XVII,"whether with distinct or confused knowledge, can be justly said to form"
6654,CHAPTER XVII,"the best part of language. It is more than probable, that many classes"
6655,CHAPTER XVII,"of the brute creation possess discriminating sounds, by which they can"
6656,CHAPTER XVII,"convey to each other notices of such objects as concern their food,"
6657,CHAPTER XVII,"shelter, or safety. Yet we hesitate to call the aggregate of such"
6658,CHAPTER XVII,"sounds a language, otherwise than metaphorically. The best part of human"
6659,CHAPTER XVII,"language, properly so called, is derived from reflection on the acts"
6660,CHAPTER XVII,of the mind itself. It is formed by a voluntary appropriation of fixed
6661,CHAPTER XVII,"symbols to internal acts, to processes and results of imagination, the"
6662,CHAPTER XVII,greater part of which have no place in the consciousness of uneducated
6663,CHAPTER XVII,"man; though in civilized society, by imitation and passive remembrance"
6664,CHAPTER XVII,"of what they hear from their religious instructors and other superiors,"
6665,CHAPTER XVII,"the most uneducated share in the harvest which they neither sowed,"
6666,CHAPTER XVII,nor reaped. If the history of the phrases in hourly currency among our
6667,CHAPTER XVII,"peasants were traced, a person not previously aware of the fact would"
6668,CHAPTER XVII,"be surprised at finding so large a number, which three or four centuries"
6669,CHAPTER XVII,ago were the exclusive property of the universities and the schools;
6670,CHAPTER XVII,"and, at the commencement of the Reformation, had been transferred from"
6671,CHAPTER XVII,"the school to the pulpit, and thus gradually passed into common life."
6672,CHAPTER XVII,"The extreme difficulty, and often the impossibility, of finding words"
6673,CHAPTER XVII,for the simplest moral and intellectual processes of the languages of
6674,CHAPTER XVII,uncivilized tribes has proved perhaps the weightiest obstacle to the
6675,CHAPTER XVII,progress of our most zealous and adroit missionaries. Yet these tribes
6676,CHAPTER XVII,are surrounded by the same nature as our peasants are; but in still more
6677,CHAPTER XVII,"impressive forms; and they are, moreover, obliged to particularize many"
6678,CHAPTER XVII,"more of them. When, therefore, Mr. Wordsworth adds, “accordingly, such"
6679,CHAPTER XVII,"a language”--(meaning, as before, the language of rustic life purified"
6680,CHAPTER XVII,from provincialism)--“arising out of repeated experience and regular
6681,CHAPTER XVII,"feelings, is a more permanent, and a far more philosophical language,"
6682,CHAPTER XVII,"than that which is frequently substituted for it by Poets, who think"
6683,CHAPTER XVII,that they are conferring honour upon themselves and their art in
6684,CHAPTER XVII,proportion as they indulge in arbitrary and capricious habits of
6685,CHAPTER XVII,"expression;” it may be answered, that the language, which he has in"
6686,CHAPTER XVII,"view, can be attributed to rustics with no greater right, than the style"
6687,CHAPTER XVII,"of Hooker or Bacon to Tom Brown or Sir Roger L’Estrange. Doubtless, if"
6688,CHAPTER XVII,"what is peculiar to each were omitted in each, the result must needs be"
6689,CHAPTER XVII,"the same. Further, that the poet, who uses an illogical diction, or a"
6690,CHAPTER XVII,style fitted to excite only the low and changeable pleasure of wonder by
6691,CHAPTER XVII,"means of groundless novelty, substitutes a language of folly and vanity,"
6692,CHAPTER XVII,"not for that of the rustic, but for that of good sense and natural"
6693,CHAPTER XVII,feeling.
6694,CHAPTER XVII,
6695,CHAPTER XVII,"Here let me be permitted to remind the reader, that the positions, which"
6696,CHAPTER XVII,"I controvert, are contained in the sentences--“a selection of the real"
6697,CHAPTER XVII,"language of men;”--“the language of these men” (that is, men in low and"
6698,CHAPTER XVII,"rustic life) “has been adopted; I have proposed to myself to imitate,"
6699,CHAPTER XVII,"and, as far as is possible, to adopt the very language of men.”"
6700,CHAPTER XVII,
6701,CHAPTER XVII,"“Between the language of prose and that of metrical composition, there"
6702,CHAPTER XVII,"neither is, nor can be, any essential difference:” it is against these"
6703,CHAPTER XVII,exclusively that my opposition is directed.
6704,CHAPTER XVII,
6705,CHAPTER XVII,"I object, in the very first instance, to an equivocation in the use of"
6706,CHAPTER XVII,"the word “real.” Every man’s language varies, according to the extent of"
6707,CHAPTER XVII,"his knowledge, the activity of his faculties, and the depth or quickness"
6708,CHAPTER XVII,"of his feelings. Every man’s language has, first, its individualities;"
6709,CHAPTER XVII,"secondly, the common properties of the class to which he belongs; and"
6710,CHAPTER XVII,"thirdly, words and phrases of universal use. The language of Hooker,"
6711,CHAPTER XVII,"Bacon, Bishop Taylor, and Burke differs from the common language of the"
6712,CHAPTER XVII,learned class only by the superior number and novelty of the thoughts
6713,CHAPTER XVII,and relations which they had to convey. The language of Algernon Sidney
6714,CHAPTER XVII,"differs not at all from that, which every well-educated gentleman would"
6715,CHAPTER XVII,"wish to write, and (with due allowances for the undeliberateness, and"
6716,CHAPTER XVII,"less connected train, of thinking natural and proper to conversation)"
6717,CHAPTER XVII,such as he would wish to talk. Neither one nor the other differ half as
6718,CHAPTER XVII,"much from the general language of cultivated society, as the language"
6719,CHAPTER XVII,of Mr. Wordsworth’s homeliest composition differs from that of a common
6720,CHAPTER XVII,"peasant. For “real” therefore, we must substitute ordinary, or lingua"
6721,CHAPTER XVII,"communis. And this, we have proved, is no more to be found in the"
6722,CHAPTER XVII,phraseology of low and rustic life than in that of any other class. Omit
6723,CHAPTER XVII,the peculiarities of each and the result of course must be common to
6724,CHAPTER XVII,all. And assuredly the omissions and changes to be made in the language
6725,CHAPTER XVII,"of rustics, before it could be transferred to any species of poem,"
6726,CHAPTER XVII,"except the drama or other professed imitation, are at least as numerous"
6727,CHAPTER XVII,"and weighty, as would be required in adapting to the same purpose the"
6728,CHAPTER XVII,"ordinary language of tradesmen and manufacturers. Not to mention,"
6729,CHAPTER XVII,that the language so highly extolled by Mr. Wordsworth varies in every
6730,CHAPTER XVII,"county, nay in every village, according to the accidental character"
6731,CHAPTER XVII,"of the clergyman, the existence or non-existence of schools; or even,"
6732,CHAPTER XVII,"perhaps, as the exciteman, publican, and barber happen to be, or not to"
6733,CHAPTER XVII,"be, zealous politicians, and readers of the weekly newspaper pro bono"
6734,CHAPTER XVII,"publico. Anterior to cultivation the lingua communis of every country,"
6735,CHAPTER XVII,"as Dante has well observed, exists every where in parts, and no where as"
6736,CHAPTER XVII,a whole.
6737,CHAPTER XVII,
6738,CHAPTER XVII,Neither is the case rendered at all more tenable by the addition of
6739,CHAPTER XVII,"the words, “in a state of excitement.” For the nature of a man’s words,"
6740,CHAPTER XVII,"where he is strongly affected by joy, grief, or anger, must necessarily"
6741,CHAPTER XVII,"depend on the number and quality of the general truths, conceptions and"
6742,CHAPTER XVII,"images, and of the words expressing them, with which his mind had been"
6743,CHAPTER XVII,previously stored. For the property of passion is not to create; but
6744,CHAPTER XVII,"to set in increased activity. At least, whatever new connections of"
6745,CHAPTER XVII,"thoughts or images, or--(which is equally, if not more than equally,"
6746,CHAPTER XVII,the appropriate effect of strong excitement)--whatever generalizations
6747,CHAPTER XVII,of truth or experience the heat of passion may produce; yet the terms of
6748,CHAPTER XVII,"their conveyance must have pre-existed in his former conversations, and"
6749,CHAPTER XVII,are only collected and crowded together by the unusual stimulation. It
6750,CHAPTER XVII,"is indeed very possible to adopt in a poem the unmeaning repetitions,"
6751,CHAPTER XVII,"habitual phrases, and other blank counters, which an unfurnished or"
6752,CHAPTER XVII,"confused understanding interposes at short intervals, in order to keep"
6753,CHAPTER XVII,"hold of his subject, which is still slipping from him, and to give him"
6754,CHAPTER XVII,"time for recollection; or, in mere aid of vacancy, as in the scanty"
6755,CHAPTER XVII,companies of a country stage the same player pops backwards and
6756,CHAPTER XVII,"forwards, in order to prevent the appearance of empty spaces, in the"
6757,CHAPTER XVII,"procession of Macbeth, or Henry VIII. But what assistance to the poet,"
6758,CHAPTER XVII,"or ornament to the poem, these can supply, I am at a loss to conjecture."
6759,CHAPTER XVII,Nothing assuredly can differ either in origin or in mode more widely
6760,CHAPTER XVII,"from the apparent tautologies of intense and turbulent feeling, in which"
6761,CHAPTER XVII,the passion is greater and of longer endurance than to be exhausted or
6762,CHAPTER XVII,satisfied by a single representation of the image or incident exciting
6763,CHAPTER XVII,it. Such repetitions I admit to be a beauty of the highest kind; as
6764,CHAPTER XVII,illustrated by Mr. Wordsworth himself from the song of Deborah. At her
6765,CHAPTER XVII,"feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell:"
6766,CHAPTER XVII,"where he bowed, there he fell down dead. Judges v. 27."
6767,CHAPTER XVII,
6768,CHAPTER XVII,
6769,CHAPTER XVII,
6770,CHAPTER XVII,
6771,CHAPTER XVIII,CHAPTER XVIII
6772,CHAPTER XVIII,
6773,CHAPTER XVIII,"Language of metrical composition, why and wherein essentially different"
6774,CHAPTER XVIII,from that of prose--Origin and elements of metre--Its necessary
6775,CHAPTER XVIII,"consequences, and the conditions thereby imposed on the metrical writer"
6776,CHAPTER XVIII,in the choice of his diction.
6777,CHAPTER XVIII,
6778,CHAPTER XVIII,
6779,CHAPTER XVIII,"I conclude, therefore, that the attempt is impracticable; and that, were"
6780,CHAPTER XVIII,"it not impracticable, it would still be useless. For the very power of"
6781,CHAPTER XVIII,making the selection implies the previous possession of the language
6782,CHAPTER XVIII,selected. Or where can the poet have lived? And by what rules could
6783,CHAPTER XVIII,"he direct his choice, which would not have enabled him to select and"
6784,CHAPTER XVIII,arrange his words by the light of his own judgment? We do not adopt the
6785,CHAPTER XVIII,"language of a class by the mere adoption of such words exclusively, as"
6786,CHAPTER XVIII,"that class would use, or at least understand; but likewise by following"
6787,CHAPTER XVIII,"the order, in which the words of such men are wont to succeed each"
6788,CHAPTER XVIII,"other. Now this order, in the intercourse of uneducated men, is"
6789,CHAPTER XVIII,distinguished from the diction of their superiors in knowledge and
6790,CHAPTER XVIII,"power, by the greater disjunction and separation in the component parts"
6791,CHAPTER XVIII,"of that, whatever it be, which they wish to communicate. There is a want"
6792,CHAPTER XVIII,"of that prospectiveness of mind, that surview, which enables a man"
6793,CHAPTER XVIII,"to foresee the whole of what he is to convey, appertaining to any one"
6794,CHAPTER XVIII,point; and by this means so to subordinate and arrange the different
6795,CHAPTER XVIII,"parts according to their relative importance, as to convey it at once,"
6796,CHAPTER XVIII,and as an organized whole.
6797,CHAPTER XVIII,
6798,CHAPTER XVIII,"Now I will take the first stanza, on which I have chanced to open, in"
6799,CHAPTER XVIII,the Lyrical Ballads. It is one the most simple and the least peculiar in
6800,CHAPTER XVIII,its language.
6801,CHAPTER XVIII,
6802,CHAPTER XVIII,"“In distant countries have I been,"
6803,CHAPTER XVIII,And yet I have not often seen
6804,CHAPTER XVIII,"A healthy man, a man full grown,"
6805,CHAPTER XVIII,"Weep in the public roads, alone."
6806,CHAPTER XVIII,"But such a one, on English ground,"
6807,CHAPTER XVIII,"And in the broad highway, I met;"
6808,CHAPTER XVIII,"Along the broad highway he came,"
6809,CHAPTER XVIII,His cheeks with tears were wet
6810,CHAPTER XVIII,"Sturdy he seemed, though he was sad;"
6811,CHAPTER XVIII,And in his arms a lamb he had.”
6812,CHAPTER XVIII,
6813,CHAPTER XVIII,The words here are doubtless such as are current in all ranks of life;
6814,CHAPTER XVIII,"and of course not less so in the hamlet and cottage than in the shop,"
6815,CHAPTER XVIII,"manufactory, college, or palace. But is this the order, in which the"
6816,CHAPTER XVIII,"rustic would have placed the words? I am grievously deceived, if the"
6817,CHAPTER XVIII,following less compact mode of commencing the same tale be not a far
6818,CHAPTER XVIII,"more faithful copy. “I have been in a many parts, far and near, and I"
6819,CHAPTER XVIII,don’t know that I ever saw before a man crying by himself in the public
6820,CHAPTER XVIII,"road; a grown man I mean, that was neither sick nor hurt,” etc., etc."
6821,CHAPTER XVIII,But when I turn to the following stanza in The Thorn:
6822,CHAPTER XVIII,
6823,CHAPTER XVIII,“At all times of the day and night
6824,CHAPTER XVIII,This wretched woman thither goes;
6825,CHAPTER XVIII,"And she is known to every star,"
6826,CHAPTER XVIII,And every wind that blows
6827,CHAPTER XVIII,"And there, beside the Thorn, she sits,"
6828,CHAPTER XVIII,"When the blue day-light’s in the skies,"
6829,CHAPTER XVIII,"And when the whirlwind’s on the hill,"
6830,CHAPTER XVIII,"Or frosty air is keen and still,"
6831,CHAPTER XVIII,"And to herself she cries,"
6832,CHAPTER XVIII,Oh misery! Oh misery!
6833,CHAPTER XVIII,Oh woe is me! Oh misery!”
6834,CHAPTER XVIII,
6835,CHAPTER XVIII,and compare this with the language of ordinary men; or with that which
6836,CHAPTER XVIII,"I can conceive at all likely to proceed, in real life, from such a"
6837,CHAPTER XVIII,"narrator, as is supposed in the note to the poem; compare it either in"
6838,CHAPTER XVIII,the succession of the images or of the sentences; I am reminded of the
6839,CHAPTER XVIII,"sublime prayer and hymn of praise, which Milton, in opposition to an"
6840,CHAPTER XVIII,"established liturgy, presents as a fair specimen of common extemporary"
6841,CHAPTER XVIII,"devotion, and such as we might expect to hear from every self-inspired"
6842,CHAPTER XVIII,"minister of a conventicle! And I reflect with delight, how little a mere"
6843,CHAPTER XVIII,"theory, though of his own workmanship, interferes with the processes of"
6844,CHAPTER XVIII,"genuine imagination in a man of true poetic genius, who possesses, as"
6845,CHAPTER XVIII,"Mr. Wordsworth, if ever man did, most assuredly does possess,"
6846,CHAPTER XVIII,
6847,CHAPTER XVIII,“The Vision and the Faculty divine.”
6848,CHAPTER XVIII,
6849,CHAPTER XVIII,"One point then alone remains, but that the most important; its"
6850,CHAPTER XVIII,"examination having been, indeed, my chief inducement for the preceding"
6851,CHAPTER XVIII,inquisition. “There neither is nor can be any essential difference
6852,CHAPTER XVIII,between the language of prose and metrical composition.” Such is Mr.
6853,CHAPTER XVIII,"Wordsworth’s assertion. Now prose itself, at least in all argumentative"
6854,CHAPTER XVIII,"and consecutive works, differs, and ought to differ, from the language"
6855,CHAPTER XVIII,of conversation; even as [66] reading ought to differ from talking.
6856,CHAPTER XVIII,"Unless therefore the difference denied be that of the mere words, as"
6857,CHAPTER XVIII,"materials common to all styles of writing, and not of the style itself"
6858,CHAPTER XVIII,"in the universally admitted sense of the term, it might be naturally"
6859,CHAPTER XVIII,presumed that there must exist a still greater between the ordonnance
6860,CHAPTER XVIII,"of poetic composition and that of prose, than is expected to distinguish"
6861,CHAPTER XVIII,prose from ordinary conversation.
6862,CHAPTER XVIII,
6863,CHAPTER XVIII,"There are not, indeed, examples wanting in the history of literature,"
6864,CHAPTER XVIII,of apparent paradoxes that have summoned the public wonder as new and
6865,CHAPTER XVIII,"startling truths, but which, on examination, have shrunk into tame and"
6866,CHAPTER XVIII,"harmless truisms; as the eyes of a cat, seen in the dark, have been"
6867,CHAPTER XVIII,"mistaken for flames of fire. But Mr. Wordsworth is among the last men,"
6868,CHAPTER XVIII,"to whom a delusion of this kind would be attributed by anyone, who"
6869,CHAPTER XVIII,had enjoyed the slightest opportunity of understanding his mind and
6870,CHAPTER XVIII,character. Where an objection has been anticipated by such an author as
6871,CHAPTER XVIII,"natural, his answer to it must needs be interpreted in some sense which"
6872,CHAPTER XVIII,"either is, or has been, or is capable of being controverted. My object"
6873,CHAPTER XVIII,then must be to discover some other meaning for the term “essential
6874,CHAPTER XVIII,"difference” in this place, exclusive of the indistinction and community"
6875,CHAPTER XVIII,of the words themselves. For whether there ought to exist a class of
6876,CHAPTER XVIII,"words in the English, in any degree resembling the poetic dialect of"
6877,CHAPTER XVIII,"the Greek and Italian, is a question of very subordinate importance. The"
6878,CHAPTER XVIII,"number of such words would be small indeed, in our language; and even in"
6879,CHAPTER XVIII,"the Italian and Greek, they consist not so much of different words, as"
6880,CHAPTER XVIII,of slight differences in the forms of declining and conjugating the same
6881,CHAPTER XVIII,"words; forms, doubtless, which having been, at some period more or less"
6882,CHAPTER XVIII,"remote, the common grammatic flexions of some tribe or province, had"
6883,CHAPTER XVIII,been accidentally appropriated to poetry by the general admiration of
6884,CHAPTER XVIII,"certain master intellects, the first established lights of inspiration,"
6885,CHAPTER XVIII,to whom that dialect happened to be native.
6886,CHAPTER XVIII,
6887,CHAPTER XVIII,"Essence, in its primary signification, means the principle of"
6888,CHAPTER XVIII,"individuation, the inmost principle of the possibility of any thing, as"
6889,CHAPTER XVIII,"that particular thing. It is equivalent to the idea of a thing, whenever"
6890,CHAPTER XVIII,"we use the word, idea, with philosophic precision. Existence, on the"
6891,CHAPTER XVIII,"other hand, is distinguished from essence, by the superinduction of"
6892,CHAPTER XVIII,"reality. Thus we speak of the essence, and essential properties of a"
6893,CHAPTER XVIII,"circle; but we do not therefore assert, that any thing, which really"
6894,CHAPTER XVIII,"exists, is mathematically circular. Thus too, without any tautology we"
6895,CHAPTER XVIII,"contend for the existence of the Supreme Being; that is, for a reality"
6896,CHAPTER XVIII,"correspondent to the idea. There is, next, a secondary use of the word"
6897,CHAPTER XVIII,"essence, in which it signifies the point or ground of contra-distinction"
6898,CHAPTER XVIII,between two modifications of the same substance or subject. Thus we
6899,CHAPTER XVIII,"should be allowed to say, that the style of architecture of Westminster"
6900,CHAPTER XVIII,"Abbey is essentially different from that of St. Paul, even though both"
6901,CHAPTER XVIII,"had been built with blocks cut into the same form, and from the same"
6902,CHAPTER XVIII,quarry. Only in this latter sense of the term must it have been denied
6903,CHAPTER XVIII,by Mr. Wordsworth (for in this sense alone is it affirmed by the general
6904,CHAPTER XVIII,"opinion) that the language of poetry (that is the formal construction,"
6905,CHAPTER XVIII,"or architecture, of the words and phrases) is essentially different from"
6906,CHAPTER XVIII,"that of prose. Now the burden of the proof lies with the oppugner,"
6907,CHAPTER XVIII,"not with the supporters of the common belief. Mr. Wordsworth, in"
6908,CHAPTER XVIII,"consequence, assigns as the proof of his position, “that not only"
6909,CHAPTER XVIII,"the language of a large portion of every good poem, even of the most"
6910,CHAPTER XVIII,"elevated character, must necessarily, except with reference to the"
6911,CHAPTER XVIII,"metre, in no respect differ from that of good prose, but likewise that"
6912,CHAPTER XVIII,some of the most interesting parts of the best poems will be found to be
6913,CHAPTER XVIII,"strictly the language of prose, when prose is well written. The truth of"
6914,CHAPTER XVIII,this assertion might be demonstrated by innumerable passages from almost
6915,CHAPTER XVIII,"all the poetical writings, even of Milton himself.” He then quotes"
6916,CHAPTER XVIII,Gray’s sonnet--
6917,CHAPTER XVIII,
6918,CHAPTER XVIII,"“In vain to me the smiling mornings shine,"
6919,CHAPTER XVIII,And reddening Phoebus lifts his golden fire;
6920,CHAPTER XVIII,"The birds in vain their amorous descant join,"
6921,CHAPTER XVIII,Or cheerful fields resume their green attire.
6922,CHAPTER XVIII,"These ears, alas! for other notes repine;"
6923,CHAPTER XVIII,_A different object do these eyes require;
6924,CHAPTER XVIII,My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine;
6925,CHAPTER XVIII,And in my breast the imperfect joys expire._
6926,CHAPTER XVIII,"Yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer,"
6927,CHAPTER XVIII,And new-born pleasure brings to happier men;
6928,CHAPTER XVIII,The fields to all their wonted tribute bear;
6929,CHAPTER XVIII,To warm their little loves the birds complain:
6930,CHAPTER XVIII,"_I fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear,"
6931,CHAPTER XVIII,"And weep the more, because I weep in vain.”_"
6932,CHAPTER XVIII,
6933,CHAPTER XVIII,"and adds the following remark:--“It will easily be perceived, that the"
6934,CHAPTER XVIII,"only part of this Sonnet which is of any value, is the lines printed in"
6935,CHAPTER XVIII,"italics; it is equally obvious, that, except in the rhyme, and in the"
6936,CHAPTER XVIII,"use of the single word `fruitless’ for fruitlessly, which is so far a"
6937,CHAPTER XVIII,"defect, the language of these lines does in no respect differ from that"
6938,CHAPTER XVIII,of prose.”
6939,CHAPTER XVIII,
6940,CHAPTER XVIII,"An idealist defending his system by the fact, that when asleep we often"
6941,CHAPTER XVIII,"believe ourselves awake, was well answered by his plain neighbour, “Ah,"
6942,CHAPTER XVIII,but when awake do we ever believe ourselves asleep?” Things identical
6943,CHAPTER XVIII,must be convertible. The preceding passage seems to rest on a similar
6944,CHAPTER XVIII,"sophism. For the question is not, whether there may not occur in prose"
6945,CHAPTER XVIII,"an order of words, which would be equally proper in a poem; nor whether"
6946,CHAPTER XVIII,there are not beautiful lines and sentences of frequent occurrence in
6947,CHAPTER XVIII,"good poems, which would be equally becoming as well as beautiful in good"
6948,CHAPTER XVIII,prose; for neither the one nor the other has ever been either denied
6949,CHAPTER XVIII,"or doubted by any one. The true question must be, whether there are not"
6950,CHAPTER XVIII,"modes of expression, a construction, and an order of sentences, which"
6951,CHAPTER XVIII,"are in their fit and natural place in a serious prose composition, but"
6952,CHAPTER XVIII,"would be disproportionate and heterogeneous in metrical poetry; and,"
6953,CHAPTER XVIII,"vice versa, whether in the language of a serious poem there may not be"
6954,CHAPTER XVIII,"an arrangement both of words and sentences, and a use and selection"
6955,CHAPTER XVIII,"of (what are called) figures of speech, both as to their kind, their"
6956,CHAPTER XVIII,"frequency, and their occasions, which on a subject of equal weight would"
6957,CHAPTER XVIII,"be vicious and alien in correct and manly prose. I contend, that in both"
6958,CHAPTER XVIII,cases this unfitness of each for the place of the other frequently will
6959,CHAPTER XVIII,and ought to exist.
6960,CHAPTER XVIII,
6961,CHAPTER XVIII,And first from the origin of metre. This I would trace to the balance
6962,CHAPTER XVIII,in the mind effected by that spontaneous effort which strives to hold in
6963,CHAPTER XVIII,check the workings of passion. It might be easily explained likewise
6964,CHAPTER XVIII,"in what manner this salutary antagonism is assisted by the very state,"
6965,CHAPTER XVIII,which it counteracts; and how this balance of antagonists became
6966,CHAPTER XVIII,"organized into metre (in the usual acceptation of that term), by a"
6967,CHAPTER XVIII,"supervening act of the will and judgment, consciously and for the"
6968,CHAPTER XVIII,"foreseen purpose of pleasure. Assuming these principles, as the data of"
6969,CHAPTER XVIII,"our argument, we deduce from them two legitimate conditions, which the"
6970,CHAPTER XVIII,"critic is entitled to expect in every metrical work. First, that, as"
6971,CHAPTER XVIII,the elements of metre owe their existence to a state of increased
6972,CHAPTER XVIII,"excitement, so the metre itself should be accompanied by the natural"
6973,CHAPTER XVIII,"language of excitement. Secondly, that as these elements are formed"
6974,CHAPTER XVIII,"into metre artificially, by a voluntary act, with the design and for"
6975,CHAPTER XVIII,"the purpose of blending delight with emotion, so the traces of present"
6976,CHAPTER XVIII,volition should throughout the metrical language be proportionately
6977,CHAPTER XVIII,discernible. Now these two conditions must be reconciled and co-
6978,CHAPTER XVIII,"present. There must be not only a partnership, but a union; an"
6979,CHAPTER XVIII,"interpenetration of passion and of will, of spontaneous impulse and"
6980,CHAPTER XVIII,"of voluntary purpose. Again, this union can be manifested only in a"
6981,CHAPTER XVIII,"frequency of forms and figures of speech, (originally the offspring of"
6982,CHAPTER XVIII,"passion, but now the adopted children of power), greater than would be"
6983,CHAPTER XVIII,"desired or endured, where the emotion is not voluntarily encouraged and"
6984,CHAPTER XVIII,"kept up for the sake of that pleasure, which such emotion, so tempered"
6985,CHAPTER XVIII,"and mastered by the will, is found capable of communicating. It not only"
6986,CHAPTER XVIII,"dictates, but of itself tends to produce a more frequent employment of"
6987,CHAPTER XVIII,"picturesque and vivifying language, than would be natural in any other"
6988,CHAPTER XVIII,"case, in which there did not exist, as there does in the present, a"
6989,CHAPTER XVIII,"previous and well understood, though tacit, compact between the poet and"
6990,CHAPTER XVIII,"his reader, that the latter is entitled to expect, and the former bound"
6991,CHAPTER XVIII,to supply this species and degree of pleasurable excitement. We may
6992,CHAPTER XVIII,"in some measure apply to this union the answer of Polixenes, in the"
6993,CHAPTER XVIII,"Winter’s Tale, to Perdita’s neglect of the streaked gilliflowers,"
6994,CHAPTER XVIII,"because she had heard it said,"
6995,CHAPTER XVIII,
6996,CHAPTER XVIII,"“There is an art, which, in their piedness, shares"
6997,CHAPTER XVIII,With great creating nature.
6998,CHAPTER XVIII,POL.                      Say there be;
6999,CHAPTER XVIII,"Yet nature is made better by no mean,"
7000,CHAPTER XVIII,"But nature makes that mean; so, o’er that art,"
7001,CHAPTER XVIII,"Which, you say, adds to nature, is an art,"
7002,CHAPTER XVIII,"That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry"
7003,CHAPTER XVIII,A gentler scion to the wildest stock;
7004,CHAPTER XVIII,And make conceive a bark of baser kind
7005,CHAPTER XVIII,"By bud of nobler race. This is an art,"
7006,CHAPTER XVIII,"Which does mend nature,--change it rather; but"
7007,CHAPTER XVIII,The art itself is nature.”
7008,CHAPTER XVIII,
7009,CHAPTER XVIII,"Secondly, I argue from the effects of metre. As far as metre acts in and"
7010,CHAPTER XVIII,"for itself, it tends to increase the vivacity and susceptibility both"
7011,CHAPTER XVIII,of the general feelings and of the attention. This effect it produces by
7012,CHAPTER XVIII,"the continued excitement of surprise, and by the quick reciprocations"
7013,CHAPTER XVIII,"of curiosity still gratified and still re-excited, which are too slight"
7014,CHAPTER XVIII,"indeed to be at any one moment objects of distinct consciousness,"
7015,CHAPTER XVIII,yet become considerable in their aggregate influence. As a medicated
7016,CHAPTER XVIII,"atmosphere, or as wine during animated conversation, they act"
7017,CHAPTER XVIII,"powerfully, though themselves unnoticed. Where, therefore, correspondent"
7018,CHAPTER XVIII,food and appropriate matter are not provided for the attention and
7019,CHAPTER XVIII,feelings thus roused there must needs be a disappointment felt; like
7020,CHAPTER XVIII,"that of leaping in the dark from the last step of a stair-case, when we"
7021,CHAPTER XVIII,had prepared our muscles for a leap of three or four.
7022,CHAPTER XVIII,
7023,CHAPTER XVIII,The discussion on the powers of metre in the preface is highly ingenious
7024,CHAPTER XVIII,and touches at all points on truth. But I cannot find any statement of
7025,CHAPTER XVIII,its powers considered abstractly and separately. On the contrary Mr.
7026,CHAPTER XVIII,"Wordsworth seems always to estimate metre by the powers, which it exerts"
7027,CHAPTER XVIII,"during, (and, as I think, in consequence of) its combination with other"
7028,CHAPTER XVIII,"elements of poetry. Thus the previous difficulty is left unanswered,"
7029,CHAPTER XVIII,"what the elements are, with which it must be combined, in order"
7030,CHAPTER XVIII,to produce its own effects to any pleasurable purpose. Double and
7031,CHAPTER XVIII,"tri-syllable rhymes, indeed, form a lower species of wit, and, attended"
7032,CHAPTER XVIII,"to exclusively for their own sake, may become a source of momentary"
7033,CHAPTER XVIII,amusement; as in poor Smart’s distich to the Welsh Squire who had
7034,CHAPTER XVIII,promised him a hare:
7035,CHAPTER XVIII,
7036,CHAPTER XVIII,"“Tell me, thou son of great Cadwallader!"
7037,CHAPTER XVIII,Hast sent the hare? or hast thou swallow’d her?”
7038,CHAPTER XVIII,
7039,CHAPTER XVIII,"But for any poetic purposes, metre resembles, (if the aptness of the"
7040,CHAPTER XVIII,"simile may excuse its meanness), yeast, worthless or disagreeable by"
7041,CHAPTER XVIII,"itself, but giving vivacity and spirit to the liquor with which it is"
7042,CHAPTER XVIII,proportionally combined.
7043,CHAPTER XVIII,
7044,CHAPTER XVIII,The reference to THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD by no means satisfies my
7045,CHAPTER XVIII,judgment. We all willingly throw ourselves back for awhile into the
7046,CHAPTER XVIII,"feelings of our childhood. This ballad, therefore, we read under such"
7047,CHAPTER XVIII,"recollections of our own childish feelings, as would equally endear to"
7048,CHAPTER XVIII,"us poems, which Mr. Wordsworth himself would regard as faulty in the"
7049,CHAPTER XVIII,opposite extreme of gaudy and technical ornament. Before the invention
7050,CHAPTER XVIII,"of printing, and in a still greater degree, before the introduction of"
7051,CHAPTER XVIII,"writing, metre, especially alliterative metre, (whether alliterative at"
7052,CHAPTER XVIII,"the beginning of the words, as in PIERCE PLOUMAN, or at the end, as in"
7053,CHAPTER XVIII,"rhymes) possessed an independent value as assisting the recollection,"
7054,CHAPTER XVIII,"and consequently the preservation, of any series of truths or incidents."
7055,CHAPTER XVIII,"But I am not convinced by the collation of facts, that THE CHILDREN"
7056,CHAPTER XVIII,"IN THE WOOD owes either its preservation, or its popularity, to its"
7057,CHAPTER XVIII,metrical form. Mr. Marshal’s repository affords a number of tales in
7058,CHAPTER XVIII,"prose inferior in pathos and general merit, some of as old a date, and"
7059,CHAPTER XVIII,"many as widely popular. TOM HICKATHRIFT, JACK THE GIANT-KILLER, GOODY"
7060,CHAPTER XVIII,"TWO-SHOES, and LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD are formidable rivals. And"
7061,CHAPTER XVIII,"that they have continued in prose, cannot be fairly explained by the"
7062,CHAPTER XVIII,"assumption, that the comparative meanness of their thoughts and images"
7063,CHAPTER XVIII,precluded even the humblest forms of metre. The scene of GOODY TWO-SHOES
7064,CHAPTER XVIII,"in the church is perfectly susceptible of metrical narration; and, among"
7065,CHAPTER XVIII,"the thaumata thaumastotata even of the present age, I do not recollect a"
7066,CHAPTER XVIII,"more astonishing image than that of the “whole rookery, that flew out"
7067,CHAPTER XVIII,"of the giant’s beard,” scared by the tremendous voice, with which this"
7068,CHAPTER XVIII,monster answered the challenge of the heroic TOM HICKATHRIFT!
7069,CHAPTER XVIII,
7070,CHAPTER XVIII,"If from these we turn to compositions universally, and independently of"
7071,CHAPTER XVIII,"all early associations, beloved and admired; would the MARIA, THE MONK,"
7072,CHAPTER XVIII,"or THE POOR MAN’S ASS of Sterne, be read with more delight, or have a"
7073,CHAPTER XVIII,"better chance of immortality, had they without any change in the diction"
7074,CHAPTER XVIII,"been composed in rhyme, than in their present state? If I am not grossly"
7075,CHAPTER XVIII,"mistaken, the general reply would be in the negative. Nay, I will"
7076,CHAPTER XVIII,"confess, that, in Mr. Wordsworth’s own volumes, the ANECDOTE FOR"
7077,CHAPTER XVIII,"FATHERS, SIMON LEE, ALICE FELL, BEGGARS, and THE SAILOR’S MOTHER,"
7078,CHAPTER XVIII,notwithstanding the beauties which are to be found in each of them where
7079,CHAPTER XVIII,"the poet interposes the music of his own thoughts, would have been more"
7080,CHAPTER XVIII,"delightful to me in prose, told and managed, as by Mr. Wordsworth they"
7081,CHAPTER XVIII,"would have been, in a moral essay or pedestrian tour."
7082,CHAPTER XVIII,
7083,CHAPTER XVIII,"Metre in itself is simply a stimulant of the attention, and therefore"
7084,CHAPTER XVIII,excites the question: Why is the attention to be thus stimulated? Now
7085,CHAPTER XVIII,the question cannot be answered by the pleasure of the metre itself;
7086,CHAPTER XVIII,"for this we have shown to be conditional, and dependent on the"
7087,CHAPTER XVIII,"appropriateness of the thoughts and expressions, to which the metrical"
7088,CHAPTER XVIII,form is superadded. Neither can I conceive any other answer that can be
7089,CHAPTER XVIII,"rationally given, short of this: I write in metre, because I am about to"
7090,CHAPTER XVIII,"use a language different from that of prose. Besides, where the language"
7091,CHAPTER XVIII,"is not such, how interesting soever the reflections are, that are"
7092,CHAPTER XVIII,capable of being drawn by a philosophic mind from the thoughts or
7093,CHAPTER XVIII,"incidents of the poem, the metre itself must often become feeble. Take"
7094,CHAPTER XVIII,"the last three stanzas of THE SAILOR’S MOTHER, for instance. If I could"
7095,CHAPTER XVIII,"for a moment abstract from the effect produced on the author’s feelings,"
7096,CHAPTER XVIII,"as a man, by the incident at the time of its real occurrence, I would"
7097,CHAPTER XVIII,"dare appeal to his own judgment, whether in the metre itself he found a"
7098,CHAPTER XVIII,sufficient reason for their being written metrically?
7099,CHAPTER XVIII,
7100,CHAPTER XVIII,"And, thus continuing, she said,"
7101,CHAPTER XVIII,"“I had a Son, who many a day"
7102,CHAPTER XVIII,Sailed on the seas; but he is dead;
7103,CHAPTER XVIII,In Denmark he was cast away;
7104,CHAPTER XVIII,And I have travelled far as Hull to see
7105,CHAPTER XVIII,"What clothes he might have left, or other property."
7106,CHAPTER XVIII,
7107,CHAPTER XVIII,The Bird and Cage they both were his
7108,CHAPTER XVIII,’Twas my Son’s Bird; and neat and trim
7109,CHAPTER XVIII,He kept it: many voyages
7110,CHAPTER XVIII,This Singing-bird hath gone with him;
7111,CHAPTER XVIII,When last he sailed he left the Bird behind;
7112,CHAPTER XVIII,"As it might be, perhaps, from bodings of his mind."
7113,CHAPTER XVIII,
7114,CHAPTER XVIII,He to a Fellow-lodger’s care
7115,CHAPTER XVIII,"Had left it, to be watched and fed,"
7116,CHAPTER XVIII,Till he came back again; and there
7117,CHAPTER XVIII,I found it when my Son was dead;
7118,CHAPTER XVIII,"And now, God help me for my little wit!"
7119,CHAPTER XVIII,"I trail it with me, Sir! he took so much delight in it.”"
7120,CHAPTER XVIII,
7121,CHAPTER XVIII,If disproportioning the emphasis we read these stanzas so as to make the
7122,CHAPTER XVIII,"rhymes perceptible, even tri-syllable rhymes could scarcely produce an"
7123,CHAPTER XVIII,"equal sense of oddity and strangeness, as we feel here in finding rhymes"
7124,CHAPTER XVIII,at all in sentences so exclusively colloquial. I would further ask
7125,CHAPTER XVIII,"whether, but for that visionary state, into which the figure of the"
7126,CHAPTER XVIII,woman and the susceptibility of his own genius had placed the poet’s
7127,CHAPTER XVIII,"imagination,--(a state, which spreads its influence and colouring over"
7128,CHAPTER XVIII,"all, that co-exists with the exciting cause, and in which"
7129,CHAPTER XVIII,
7130,CHAPTER XVIII,"“The simplest, and the most familiar things"
7131,CHAPTER XVIII,"Gain a strange power of spreading awe around them,”) [67]"
7132,CHAPTER XVIII,
7133,CHAPTER XVIII,I would ask the poet whether he would not have felt an abrupt downfall
7134,CHAPTER XVIII,in these verses from the preceding stanza?
7135,CHAPTER XVIII,
7136,CHAPTER XVIII,“The ancient spirit is not dead;
7137,CHAPTER XVIII,"Old times, thought I, are breathing there;"
7138,CHAPTER XVIII,Proud was I that my country bred
7139,CHAPTER XVIII,"Such strength, a dignity so fair:"
7140,CHAPTER XVIII,"She begged an alms, like one in poor estate;"
7141,CHAPTER XVIII,"I looked at her again, nor did my pride abate.”"
7142,CHAPTER XVIII,
7143,CHAPTER XVIII,"It must not be omitted, and is besides worthy of notice, that those"
7144,CHAPTER XVIII,stanzas furnish the only fair instance that I have been able to discover
7145,CHAPTER XVIII,"in all Mr. Wordsworth’s writings, of an actual adoption, or true"
7146,CHAPTER XVIII,"imitation, of the real and very language of low and rustic life, freed"
7147,CHAPTER XVIII,from provincialisms.
7148,CHAPTER XVIII,
7149,CHAPTER XVIII,"Thirdly, I deduce the position from all the causes elsewhere assigned,"
7150,CHAPTER XVIII,"which render metre the proper form of poetry, and poetry imperfect and"
7151,CHAPTER XVIII,"defective without metre. Metre, therefore, having been connected with"
7152,CHAPTER XVIII,"poetry most often and by a peculiar fitness, whatever else is combined"
7153,CHAPTER XVIII,"with metre must, though it be not itself essentially poetic, have"
7154,CHAPTER XVIII,"nevertheless some property in common with poetry, as an intermedium"
7155,CHAPTER XVIII,"of affinity, a sort, (if I may dare borrow a well-known phrase from"
7156,CHAPTER XVIII,"technical chemistry), of mordaunt between it and the super-added metre."
7157,CHAPTER XVIII,"Now poetry, Mr. Wordsworth truly affirms, does always imply passion:"
7158,CHAPTER XVIII,"which word must be here understood in its most general sense, as an"
7159,CHAPTER XVIII,excited state of the feelings and faculties. And as every passion has
7160,CHAPTER XVIII,"its proper pulse, so will it likewise have its characteristic modes"
7161,CHAPTER XVIII,of expression. But where there exists that degree of genius and talent
7162,CHAPTER XVIII,"which entitles a writer to aim at the honours of a poet, the very act of"
7163,CHAPTER XVIII,"poetic composition itself is, and is allowed to imply and to produce,"
7164,CHAPTER XVIII,"an unusual state of excitement, which of course justifies and demands a"
7165,CHAPTER XVIII,"correspondent difference of language, as truly, though not perhaps in as"
7166,CHAPTER XVIII,"marked a degree, as the excitement of love, fear, rage, or jealousy. The"
7167,CHAPTER XVIII,"vividness of the descriptions or declamations in Donne or Dryden, is as"
7168,CHAPTER XVIII,"much and as often derived from the force and fervour of the describer,"
7169,CHAPTER XVIII,"as from the reflections, forms or incidents, which constitute their"
7170,CHAPTER XVIII,subject and materials. The wheels take fire from the mere rapidity of
7171,CHAPTER XVIII,"their motion. To what extent, and under what modifications, this may"
7172,CHAPTER XVIII,"be admitted to act, I shall attempt to define in an after remark on Mr."
7173,CHAPTER XVIII,"Wordsworth’s reply to this objection, or rather on his objection to this"
7174,CHAPTER XVIII,"reply, as already anticipated in his preface."
7175,CHAPTER XVIII,
7176,CHAPTER XVIII,"Fourthly, and as intimately connected with this, if not the same"
7177,CHAPTER XVIII,"argument in a more general form, I adduce the high spiritual instinct of"
7178,CHAPTER XVIII,"the human being impelling us to seek unity by harmonious adjustment, and"
7179,CHAPTER XVIII,thus establishing the principle that all the parts of an organized whole
7180,CHAPTER XVIII,must be assimilated to the more important and essential parts. This and
7181,CHAPTER XVIII,"the preceding arguments may be strengthened by the reflection, that the"
7182,CHAPTER XVIII,"composition of a poem is among the imitative arts; and that imitation,"
7183,CHAPTER XVIII,"as opposed to copying, consists either in the interfusion of the same"
7184,CHAPTER XVIII,"throughout the radically different, or of the different throughout a"
7185,CHAPTER XVIII,base radically the same.
7186,CHAPTER XVIII,
7187,CHAPTER XVIII,"Lastly, I appeal to the practice of the best poets, of all countries"
7188,CHAPTER XVIII,"and in all ages, as authorizing the opinion, (deduced from all the"
7189,CHAPTER XVIII,"foregoing,) that in every import of the word essential, which would"
7190,CHAPTER XVIII,"not here involve a mere truism, there may be, is, and ought to be an"
7191,CHAPTER XVIII,essential difference between the language of prose and of metrical
7192,CHAPTER XVIII,composition.
7193,CHAPTER XVIII,
7194,CHAPTER XVIII,"In Mr. Wordsworth’s criticism of Gray’s Sonnet, the reader’s sympathy"
7195,CHAPTER XVIII,with his praise or blame of the different parts is taken for granted
7196,CHAPTER XVIII,"rather perhaps too easily. He has not, at least, attempted to win or"
7197,CHAPTER XVIII,"compel it by argumentative analysis. In my conception at least, the"
7198,CHAPTER XVIII,"lines rejected as of no value do, with the exception of the two first,"
7199,CHAPTER XVIII,"differ as much and as little from the language of common life, as those"
7200,CHAPTER XVIII,which he has printed in italics as possessing genuine excellence. Of the
7201,CHAPTER XVIII,"five lines thus honourably distinguished, two of them differ from prose"
7202,CHAPTER XVIII,"even more widely, than the lines which either precede or follow, in the"
7203,CHAPTER XVIII,position of the words.
7204,CHAPTER XVIII,
7205,CHAPTER XVIII,“A different object do these eyes require;
7206,CHAPTER XVIII,My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine;
7207,CHAPTER XVIII,And in my breast the imperfect joys expire.”
7208,CHAPTER XVIII,
7209,CHAPTER XVIII,"But were it otherwise, what would this prove, but a truth, of which no"
7210,CHAPTER XVIII,"man ever doubted?--videlicet, that there are sentences, which would be"
7211,CHAPTER XVIII,equally in their place both in verse and prose. Assuredly it does not
7212,CHAPTER XVIII,"prove the point, which alone requires proof; namely, that there are not"
7213,CHAPTER XVIII,"passages, which would suit the one and not suit the other. The first"
7214,CHAPTER XVIII,line of this sonnet is distinguished from the ordinary language of
7215,CHAPTER XVIII,"men by the epithet to morning. For we will set aside, at present, the"
7216,CHAPTER XVIII,"consideration, that the particular word “smiling” is hackneyed, and,"
7217,CHAPTER XVIII,"as it involves a sort of personification, not quite congruous with"
7218,CHAPTER XVIII,"the common and material attribute of “shining.” And, doubtless, this"
7219,CHAPTER XVIII,"adjunction of epithets for the purpose of additional description, where"
7220,CHAPTER XVIII,"no particular attention is demanded for the quality of the thing, would"
7221,CHAPTER XVIII,be noticed as giving a poetic cast to a man’s conversation. Should the
7222,CHAPTER XVIII,"sportsman exclaim, “Come boys! the rosy morning calls you up:” he will"
7223,CHAPTER XVIII,"be supposed to have some song in his head. But no one suspects this,"
7224,CHAPTER XVIII,"when he says, “A wet morning shall not confine us to our beds.” This"
7225,CHAPTER XVIII,"then is either a defect in poetry, or it is not. Whoever should decide"
7226,CHAPTER XVIII,"in the affirmative, I would request him to re-peruse any one poem, of"
7227,CHAPTER XVIII,"any confessedly great poet from Homer to Milton, or from Aeschylus to"
7228,CHAPTER XVIII,"Shakespeare; and to strike out, (in thought I mean), every instance of"
7229,CHAPTER XVIII,this kind. If the number of these fancied erasures did not startle him;
7230,CHAPTER XVIII,or if he continued to deem the work improved by their total omission;
7231,CHAPTER XVIII,"he must advance reasons of no ordinary strength and evidence, reasons"
7232,CHAPTER XVIII,"grounded in the essence of human nature. Otherwise, I should not"
7233,CHAPTER XVIII,hesitate to consider him as a man not so much proof against all
7234,CHAPTER XVIII,"authority, as dead to it."
7235,CHAPTER XVIII,
7236,CHAPTER XVIII,"The second line,"
7237,CHAPTER XVIII,
7238,CHAPTER XVIII,“And reddening Phoebus lifts his golden fire;--”
7239,CHAPTER XVIII,
7240,CHAPTER XVIII,"has indeed almost as many faults as words. But then it is a bad line,"
7241,CHAPTER XVIII,not because the language is distinct from that of prose; but because
7242,CHAPTER XVIII,it conveys incongruous images; because it confounds the cause and the
7243,CHAPTER XVIII,effect; the real thing with the personified representative of the thing;
7244,CHAPTER XVIII,"in short, because it differs from the language of good sense! That the"
7245,CHAPTER XVIII,"“Phoebus” is hackneyed, and a school-boy image, is an accidental fault,"
7246,CHAPTER XVIII,"dependent on the age in which the author wrote, and not deduced from"
7247,CHAPTER XVIII,"the nature of the thing. That it is part of an exploded mythology, is an"
7248,CHAPTER XVIII,objection more deeply grounded. Yet when the torch of ancient learning
7249,CHAPTER XVIII,"was re-kindled, so cheering were its beams, that our eldest poets, cut"
7250,CHAPTER XVIII,"off by Christianity from all accredited machinery, and deprived of all"
7251,CHAPTER XVIII,"acknowledged guardians and symbols of the great objects of nature,"
7252,CHAPTER XVIII,"were naturally induced to adopt, as a poetic language, those fabulous"
7253,CHAPTER XVIII,"personages, those forms of the [68]supernatural in nature, which had"
7254,CHAPTER XVIII,"given them such dear delight in the poems of their great masters. Nay,"
7255,CHAPTER XVIII,even at this day what scholar of genial taste will not so far sympathize
7256,CHAPTER XVIII,"with them, as to read with pleasure in Petrarch, Chaucer, or Spenser,"
7257,CHAPTER XVIII,what he would perhaps condemn as puerile in a modern poet?
7258,CHAPTER XVIII,
7259,CHAPTER XVIII,"I remember no poet, whose writings would safelier stand the test of Mr."
7260,CHAPTER XVIII,"Wordsworth’s theory, than Spenser. Yet will Mr. Wordsworth say, that the"
7261,CHAPTER XVIII,"style of the following stanza is either undistinguished from prose,"
7262,CHAPTER XVIII,"and the language of ordinary life? Or that it is vicious, and that the"
7263,CHAPTER XVIII,stanzas are blots in THE FAERY QUEEN?
7264,CHAPTER XVIII,
7265,CHAPTER XVIII,“By this the northern wagoner had set
7266,CHAPTER XVIII,"His sevenfold teme behind the stedfast starre,"
7267,CHAPTER XVIII,"That was in ocean waves yet never wet,"
7268,CHAPTER XVIII,But firme is fixt and sendeth light from farre

7275,CHAPTER XVIII,“At last the golden orientall gate
7276,CHAPTER XVIII,"Of greatest heaven gan to open fayre,"
7277,CHAPTER XVIII,"And Phoebus fresh, as brydegrome to his mate,"

7279,CHAPTER XVIII,And hurl’d his glist’ring beams through gloomy ayre:

7284,CHAPTER XVIII,
7285,CHAPTER XVIII,"On the contrary to how many passages, both in hymn books and in blank"
7286,CHAPTER XVIII,"verse poems, could I, (were it not invidious), direct the reader’s"
7287,CHAPTER XVIII,"attention, the style of which is most unpoetic, because, and only"
7288,CHAPTER XVIII,"because, it is the style of prose? He will not suppose me capable of"
7289,CHAPTER XVIII,"having in my mind such verses, as"
7290,CHAPTER XVIII,
7291,CHAPTER XVIII,“I put my hat upon my head
7292,CHAPTER XVIII,And walk’d into the Strand;
7293,CHAPTER XVIII,"And there I met another man,"
7294,CHAPTER XVIII,Whose hat was in his hand.”
7295,CHAPTER XVIII,
7296,CHAPTER XVIII,"To such specimens it would indeed be a fair and full reply, that these"
7297,CHAPTER XVIII,"lines are not bad, because they are unpoetic; but because they are empty"
7298,CHAPTER XVIII,of all sense and feeling; and that it were an idle attempt to prove that
7299,CHAPTER XVIII,"“an ape is not a Newton, when it is self-evident that he is not a"
7300,CHAPTER XVIII,"man.” But the sense shall be good and weighty, the language correct and"
7301,CHAPTER XVIII,"dignified, the subject interesting and treated with feeling; and yet"
7302,CHAPTER XVIII,"the style shall, notwithstanding all these merits, be justly blamable as"
7303,CHAPTER XVIII,"prosaic, and solely because the words and the order of the words would"
7304,CHAPTER XVIII,"find their appropriate place in prose, but are not suitable to metrical"
7305,CHAPTER XVIII,"composition. The CIVIL WARS of Daniel is an instructive, and even"
7306,CHAPTER XVIII,"interesting work; but take the following stanzas, (and from the hundred"
7307,CHAPTER XVIII,instances which abound I might probably have selected others far more
7308,CHAPTER XVIII,striking):
7309,CHAPTER XVIII,
7310,CHAPTER XVIII,“And to the end we may with better ease
7311,CHAPTER XVIII,"Discern the true discourse, vouchsafe to shew"
7312,CHAPTER XVIII,"What were the times foregoing near to these,"
7313,CHAPTER XVIII,That these we may with better profit know.

7315,CHAPTER XVIII,And how so great distemperature did grow;
7316,CHAPTER XVIII,So shall we see with what degrees it came;

7318,CHAPTER XVIII,
7319,CHAPTER XVIII,“Ten kings had from the Norman Conqu’ror reign’d

7341,CHAPTER XVIII,"contemporaries no less than of all succeeding critics, “the prosaic"
7342,CHAPTER XVIII,"Daniel.” Yet those, who thus designate this wise and amiable writer"
7343,CHAPTER XVIII,from the frequent incorrespondency of his diction to his metre in
7344,CHAPTER XVIII,"the majority of his compositions, not only deem them valuable and"
7345,CHAPTER XVIII,"interesting on other accounts; but willingly admit, that there are to"
7346,CHAPTER XVIII,"be found throughout his poems, and especially in his EPISTLES and in his"
7347,CHAPTER XVIII,"HYMEN’S TRIUMPH, many and exquisite specimens of that style which, as"
7348,CHAPTER XVIII,"the neutral ground of prose and verse, is common to both. A fine and"
7349,CHAPTER XVIII,"almost faultless extract, eminent as for other beauties, so for its"
7350,CHAPTER XVIII,"perfection in this species of diction, may be seen in Lamb’s DRAMATIC"
7351,CHAPTER XVIII,"SPECIMENS, a work of various interest from the nature of the selections"
7352,CHAPTER XVIII,"themselves, (all from the plays of Shakespeare’s contemporaries),--and"
7353,CHAPTER XVIII,"deriving a high additional value from the notes, which are full of just"
7354,CHAPTER XVIII,"and original criticism, expressed with all the freshness of originality."
7355,CHAPTER XVIII,
7356,CHAPTER XVIII,"Among the possible effects of practical adherence to a theory, that aims"
7357,CHAPTER XVIII,"to identify the style of prose and verse,--(if it does not indeed claim"
7358,CHAPTER XVIII,for the latter a yet nearer resemblance to the average style of men
7359,CHAPTER XVIII,in the viva voce intercourse of real life)--we might anticipate the
7360,CHAPTER XVIII,"following as not the least likely to occur. It will happen, as I have"
7361,CHAPTER XVIII,"indeed before observed, that the metre itself, the sole acknowledged"
7362,CHAPTER XVIII,"difference, will occasionally become metre to the eye only. The"
7363,CHAPTER XVIII,"existence of prosaisms, and that they detract from the merit of a poem,"
7364,CHAPTER XVIII,"must at length be conceded, when a number of successive lines can be"
7365,CHAPTER XVIII,"rendered, even to the most delicate ear, unrecognizable as verse, or"
7366,CHAPTER XVIII,"as having even been intended for verse, by simply transcribing them as"
7367,CHAPTER XVIII,"prose; when if the poem be in blank verse, this can be effected without"
7368,CHAPTER XVIII,"any alteration, or at most by merely restoring one or two words to"
7369,CHAPTER XVIII,"their proper places, from which they have been transplanted [69] for no"
7370,CHAPTER XVIII,assignable cause or reason but that of the author’s convenience; but if
7371,CHAPTER XVIII,"it be in rhyme, by the mere exchange of the final word of each line"
7372,CHAPTER XVIII,"for some other of the same meaning, equally appropriate, dignified and"
7373,CHAPTER XVIII,euphonic.
7374,CHAPTER XVIII,
7375,CHAPTER XVIII,The answer or objection in the preface to the anticipated remark
7376,CHAPTER XVIII,"“that metre paves the way to other distinctions,” is contained in the"
7377,CHAPTER XVIII,following words. “The distinction of rhyme and metre is regular and
7378,CHAPTER XVIII,"uniform, and not, like that produced by (what is usually called) poetic"
7379,CHAPTER XVIII,"diction, arbitrary, and subject to infinite caprices, upon which no"
7380,CHAPTER XVIII,calculation whatever can be made. In the one case the reader is utterly
7381,CHAPTER XVIII,at the mercy of the poet respecting what imagery or diction he may
7382,CHAPTER XVIII,"choose to connect with the passion.” But is this a poet, of whom a poet"
7383,CHAPTER XVIII,is speaking? No surely! rather of a fool or madman: or at best of a vain
7384,CHAPTER XVIII,or ignorant phantast! And might not brains so wild and so deficient
7385,CHAPTER XVIII,"make just the same havoc with rhymes and metres, as they are supposed to"
7386,CHAPTER XVIII,effect with modes and figures of speech? How is the reader at the mercy
7387,CHAPTER XVIII,"of such men? If he continue to read their nonsense, is it not his own"
7388,CHAPTER XVIII,fault? The ultimate end of criticism is much more to establish the
7389,CHAPTER XVIII,"principles of writing, than to furnish rules how to pass judgment on"
7390,CHAPTER XVIII,what has been written by others; if indeed it were possible that the two
7391,CHAPTER XVIII,"could be separated. But if it be asked, by what principles the poet is"
7392,CHAPTER XVIII,"to regulate his own style, if he do not adhere closely to the sort"
7393,CHAPTER XVIII,"and order of words which he hears in the market, wake, high-road, or"
7394,CHAPTER XVIII,"plough-field? I reply; by principles, the ignorance or neglect of which"
7395,CHAPTER XVIII,"would convict him of being no poet, but a silly or presumptuous usurper"
7396,CHAPTER XVIII,"of the name. By the principles of grammar, logic, psychology. In one"
7397,CHAPTER XVIII,"word by such a knowledge of the facts, material and spiritual, that most"
7398,CHAPTER XVIII,"appertain to his art, as, if it have been governed and applied by good"
7399,CHAPTER XVIII,"sense, and rendered instinctive by habit, becomes the representative and"
7400,CHAPTER XVIII,"reward of our past conscious reasonings, insights, and conclusions, and"
7401,CHAPTER XVIII,acquires the name of Taste. By what rule that does not leave the
7402,CHAPTER XVIII,"reader at the poet’s mercy, and the poet at his own, is the latter"
7403,CHAPTER XVIII,"to distinguish between the language suitable to suppressed, and the"
7404,CHAPTER XVIII,"language, which is characteristic of indulged, anger? Or between that of"
7405,CHAPTER XVIII,rage and that of jealousy? Is it obtained by wandering about in search
7406,CHAPTER XVIII,"of angry or jealous people in uncultivated society, in order to copy"
7407,CHAPTER XVIII,their words? Or not far rather by the power of imagination proceeding
7408,CHAPTER XVIII,"upon the all in each of human nature? By meditation, rather than by"
7409,CHAPTER XVIII,observation? And by the latter in consequence only of the former? As
7410,CHAPTER XVIII,"eyes, for which the former has pre-determined their field of vision, and"
7411,CHAPTER XVIII,"to which, as to its organ, it communicates a microscopic power? There"
7412,CHAPTER XVIII,"is not, I firmly believe, a man now living, who has, from his own inward"
7413,CHAPTER XVIII,"experience, a clearer intuition, than Mr. Wordsworth himself, that the"
7414,CHAPTER XVIII,last mentioned are the true sources of genial discrimination. Through
7415,CHAPTER XVIII,the same process and by the same creative agency will the poet
7416,CHAPTER XVIII,distinguish the degree and kind of the excitement produced by the very
7417,CHAPTER XVIII,"act of poetic composition. As intuitively will he know, what differences"
7418,CHAPTER XVIII,of style it at once inspires and justifies; what intermixture of
7419,CHAPTER XVIII,conscious volition is natural to that state; and in what instances
7420,CHAPTER XVIII,such figures and colours of speech degenerate into mere creatures of an
7421,CHAPTER XVIII,"arbitrary purpose, cold technical artifices of ornament or connection."
7422,CHAPTER XVIII,"For, even as truth is its own light and evidence, discovering at once"
7423,CHAPTER XVIII,"itself and falsehood, so is it the prerogative of poetic genius"
7424,CHAPTER XVIII,to distinguish by parental instinct its proper offspring from the
7425,CHAPTER XVIII,"changelings, which the gnomes of vanity or the fairies of fashion may"
7426,CHAPTER XVIII,have laid in its cradle or called by its names. Could a rule be
7427,CHAPTER XVIII,"given from without, poetry would cease to be poetry, and sink into a"
7428,CHAPTER XVIII,"mechanical art. It would be morphosis, not poiaesis. The rules of the"
7429,CHAPTER XVIII,Imagination are themselves the very powers of growth and production.
7430,CHAPTER XVIII,"The words to which they are reducible, present only the outlines"
7431,CHAPTER XVIII,and external appearance of the fruit. A deceptive counterfeit of the
7432,CHAPTER XVIII,superficial form and colours may be elaborated; but the marble peach
7433,CHAPTER XVIII,"feels cold and heavy, and children only put it to their mouths. We find"
7434,CHAPTER XVIII,"no difficulty in admitting as excellent, and the legitimate language of"
7435,CHAPTER XVIII,"poetic fervour self-impassioned, Donne’s apostrophe to the Sun in the"
7436,CHAPTER XVIII,second stanza of his PROGRESS OF THE SOUL.
7437,CHAPTER XVIII,
7438,CHAPTER XVIII,"“Thee, eye of heaven! this great Soul envies not;"
7439,CHAPTER XVIII,"By thy male force is all, we have, begot."
7440,CHAPTER XVIII,"In the first East thou now beginn’st to shine,"
7441,CHAPTER XVIII,"Suck’st early balm and island spices there,"
7442,CHAPTER XVIII,And wilt anon in thy loose-rein’d career
7443,CHAPTER XVIII,"At Tagus, Po, Seine, Thames, and Danow dine,"
7444,CHAPTER XVIII,And see at night this western world of mine:
7445,CHAPTER XVIII,"Yet hast thou not more nations seen than she,"
7446,CHAPTER XVIII,"Who before thee one day began to be,"
7447,CHAPTER XVIII,"And, thy frail light being quench’d, shall long, long outlive"
7448,CHAPTER XVIII,thee.”
7449,CHAPTER XVIII,
7450,CHAPTER XVIII,Or the next stanza but one:
7451,CHAPTER XVIII,
7452,CHAPTER XVIII,"“Great Destiny, the commissary of God,"
7453,CHAPTER XVIII,That hast mark’d out a path and period
7454,CHAPTER XVIII,"For every thing! Who, where we offspring took,"
7455,CHAPTER XVIII,Our ways and ends see’st at one instant: thou
7456,CHAPTER XVIII,"Knot of all causes! Thou, whose changeless brow"
7457,CHAPTER XVIII,"Ne’er smiles nor frowns! O! vouchsafe thou to look,"
7458,CHAPTER XVIII,"And shew my story in thy eternal book,” etc."
7459,CHAPTER XVIII,
7460,CHAPTER XVIII,As little difficulty do we find in excluding from the honours of
7461,CHAPTER XVIII,"unaffected warmth and elevation the madness prepense of pseudopoesy, or"
7462,CHAPTER XVIII,"the startling hysteric of weakness over-exerting itself, which bursts on"
7463,CHAPTER XVIII,the unprepared reader in sundry odes and apostrophes to abstract terms.
7464,CHAPTER XVIII,"Such are the Odes to jealousy, to Hope, to Oblivion, and the like, in"
7465,CHAPTER XVIII,"Dodsley’s collection and the magazines of that day, which seldom fail"
7466,CHAPTER XVIII,"to remind me of an Oxford copy of verses on the two SUTTONS, commencing"
7467,CHAPTER XVIII,with
7468,CHAPTER XVIII,
7469,CHAPTER XVIII,"“Inoculation, heavenly maid! descend!”"
7470,CHAPTER XVIII,
7471,CHAPTER XVIII,"It is not to be denied that men of undoubted talents, and even poets"
7472,CHAPTER XVIII,"of true, though not of first-rate, genius, have from a mistaken theory"
7473,CHAPTER XVIII,deluded both themselves and others in the opposite extreme. I once read
7474,CHAPTER XVIII,to a company of sensible and well-educated women the introductory period
7475,CHAPTER XVIII,"of Cowley’s preface to his “Pindaric Odes,” written in imitation of"
7476,CHAPTER XVIII,"the style and manner of the odes of Pindar. “If,” (says Cowley), “a man"
7477,CHAPTER XVIII,"should undertake to translate Pindar, word for word, it would be thought"
7478,CHAPTER XVIII,"that one madman had translated another as may appear, when he, that"
7479,CHAPTER XVIII,"understands not the original, reads the verbal traduction of him into"
7480,CHAPTER XVIII,"Latin prose, than which nothing seems more raving.” I then proceeded"
7481,CHAPTER XVIII,"with his own free version of the second Olympic, composed for the"
7482,CHAPTER XVIII,charitable purpose of rationalizing the Theban Eagle.
7483,CHAPTER XVIII,
7484,CHAPTER XVIII,"“Queen of all harmonious things,"
7485,CHAPTER XVIII,"Dancing words and speaking strings,"
7486,CHAPTER XVIII,"What god, what hero, wilt thou sing?"
7487,CHAPTER XVIII,What happy man to equal glories bring?
7488,CHAPTER XVIII,"Begin, begin thy noble choice,"
7489,CHAPTER XVIII,And let the hills around reflect the image of thy voice.
7490,CHAPTER XVIII,"Pisa does to Jove belong,"
7491,CHAPTER XVIII,Jove and Pisa claim thy song.
7492,CHAPTER XVIII,"The fair first-fruits of war, th’ Olympic games,"
7493,CHAPTER XVIII,"Alcides, offer’d up to Jove;"
7494,CHAPTER XVIII,"Alcides, too, thy strings may move,"
7495,CHAPTER XVIII,"But, oh! what man to join with these can worthy prove?"
7496,CHAPTER XVIII,Join Theron boldly to their sacred names;
7497,CHAPTER XVIII,Theron the next honour claims;
7498,CHAPTER XVIII,"Theron to no man gives place,"
7499,CHAPTER XVIII,Is first in Pisa’s and in Virtue’s race;
7500,CHAPTER XVIII,"Theron there, and he alone,"
7501,CHAPTER XVIII,Ev’n his own swift forefathers has outgone.”
7502,CHAPTER XVIII,
7503,CHAPTER XVIII,"One of the company exclaimed, with the full assent of the rest, that"
7504,CHAPTER XVIII,"if the original were madder than this, it must be incurably mad. I then"
7505,CHAPTER XVIII,"translated the ode from the Greek, and as nearly as possible, word"
7506,CHAPTER XVIII,"for word; and the impression was, that in the general movement of the"
7507,CHAPTER XVIII,"periods, in the form of the connections and transitions, and in the"
7508,CHAPTER XVIII,"sober majesty of lofty sense, it appeared to them to approach more"
7509,CHAPTER XVIII,"nearly, than any other poetry they had heard, to the style of our Bible,"
7510,CHAPTER XVIII,in the prophetic books. The first strophe will suffice as a specimen:
7511,CHAPTER XVIII,
7512,CHAPTER XVIII,“Ye harp-controlling hymns! (or) ye hymns the sovereigns of harps!
7513,CHAPTER XVIII,What God? what Hero?
7514,CHAPTER XVIII,What Man shall we celebrate?
7515,CHAPTER XVIII,"Truly Pisa indeed is of Jove,"
7516,CHAPTER XVIII,"But the Olympiad (or the Olympic games) did Hercules establish,"
7517,CHAPTER XVIII,The first-fruits of the spoils of war.
7518,CHAPTER XVIII,"But Theron for the four-horsed car,"
7519,CHAPTER XVIII,"That bore victory to him,"
7520,CHAPTER XVIII,It behoves us now to voice aloud:
7521,CHAPTER XVIII,"The Just, the Hospitable,"
7522,CHAPTER XVIII,"The Bulwark of Agrigentum,"
7523,CHAPTER XVIII,Of renowned fathers
7524,CHAPTER XVIII,"The Flower, even him"
7525,CHAPTER XVIII,Who preserves his native city erect and safe.”
7526,CHAPTER XVIII,
7527,CHAPTER XVIII,But are such rhetorical caprices condemnable only for their deviation
7528,CHAPTER XVIII,from the language of real life? and are they by no other means to be
7529,CHAPTER XVIII,"precluded, but by the rejection of all distinctions between prose and"
7530,CHAPTER XVIII,"verse, save that of metre? Surely good sense, and a moderate insight"
7531,CHAPTER XVIII,"into the constitution of the human mind, would be amply sufficient to"
7532,CHAPTER XVIII,"prove, that such language and such combinations are the native product"
7533,CHAPTER XVIII,neither of the fancy nor of the imagination; that their operation
7534,CHAPTER XVIII,consists in the excitement of surprise by the juxta-position and
7535,CHAPTER XVIII,apparent reconciliation of widely different or incompatible things. As
7536,CHAPTER XVIII,"when, for instance, the hills are made to reflect the image of a"
7537,CHAPTER XVIII,"voice. Surely, no unusual taste is requisite to see clearly, that"
7538,CHAPTER XVIII,this compulsory juxtaposition is not produced by the presentation of
7539,CHAPTER XVIII,"impressive or delightful forms to the inward vision, nor by any sympathy"
7540,CHAPTER XVIII,with the modifying powers with which the genius of the poet had united
7541,CHAPTER XVIII,and inspirited all the objects of his thought; that it is therefore
7542,CHAPTER XVIII,"a species of wit, a pure work of the will, and implies a leisure and"
7543,CHAPTER XVIII,"self-possession both of thought and of feeling, incompatible with the"
7544,CHAPTER XVIII,steady fervour of a mind possessed and filled with the grandeur of its
7545,CHAPTER XVIII,"subject. To sum up the whole in one sentence. When a poem, or a part of"
7546,CHAPTER XVIII,"a poem, shall be adduced, which is evidently vicious in the figures and"
7547,CHAPTER XVIII,"centexture of its style, yet for the condemnation of which no reason can"
7548,CHAPTER XVIII,"be assigned, except that it differs from the style in which men actually"
7549,CHAPTER XVIII,"converse, then, and not till then, can I hold this theory to be either"
7550,CHAPTER XVIII,"plausible, or practicable, or capable of furnishing either rule,"
7551,CHAPTER XVIII,"guidance, or precaution, that might not, more easily and more safely, as"
7552,CHAPTER XVIII,"well as more naturally, have been deduced in the author’s own mind from"
7553,CHAPTER XVIII,"considerations of grammar, logic, and the truth and nature of things,"
7554,CHAPTER XVIII,"confirmed by the authority of works, whose fame is not of one country"
7555,CHAPTER XVIII,nor of one age.
7556,CHAPTER XVIII,
7557,CHAPTER XVIII,
7558,CHAPTER XVIII,
7559,CHAPTER XVIII,
7560,CHAPTER XIX,CHAPTER XIX
7561,CHAPTER XIX,
7562,CHAPTER XIX,"Continuation--Concerning the real object which, it is probable, Mr."
7563,CHAPTER XIX,Wordsworth had before him in his critical preface--Elucidation and
7564,CHAPTER XIX,application of this.
7565,CHAPTER XIX,
7566,CHAPTER XIX,
7567,CHAPTER XIX,It might appear from some passages in the former part of Mr.
7568,CHAPTER XIX,"Wordsworth’s preface, that he meant to confine his theory of style, and"
7569,CHAPTER XIX,"the necessity of a close accordance with the actual language of men,"
7570,CHAPTER XIX,"to those particular subjects from low and rustic life, which by way of"
7571,CHAPTER XIX,experiment he had purposed to naturalize as a new species in our English
7572,CHAPTER XIX,poetry. But from the train of argument that follows; from the reference
7573,CHAPTER XIX,to Milton; and from the spirit of his critique on Gray’s sonnet; those
7574,CHAPTER XIX,"sentences appear to have been rather courtesies of modesty, than actual"
7575,CHAPTER XIX,limitations of his system. Yet so groundless does this system appear
7576,CHAPTER XIX,on a close examination; and so strange and overwhelming [70] in its
7577,CHAPTER XIX,"consequences, that I cannot, and I do not, believe that the poet did"
7578,CHAPTER XIX,"ever himself adopt it in the unqualified sense, in which his expressions"
7579,CHAPTER XIX,"have been understood by others, and which, indeed, according to all the"
7580,CHAPTER XIX,common laws of interpretation they seem to bear. What then did he
7581,CHAPTER XIX,"mean? I apprehend, that in the clear perception, not unaccompanied with"
7582,CHAPTER XIX,"disgust or contempt, of the gaudy affectations of a style which passed"
7583,CHAPTER XIX,"current with too many for poetic diction, (though in truth it had as"
7584,CHAPTER XIX,"little pretensions to poetry, as to logic or common sense,) he narrowed"
7585,CHAPTER XIX,his view for the time; and feeling a justifiable preference for the
7586,CHAPTER XIX,"language of nature and of good sense, even in its humblest and least"
7587,CHAPTER XIX,"ornamented forms, he suffered himself to express, in terms at once too"
7588,CHAPTER XIX,"large and too exclusive, his predilection for a style the most remote"
7589,CHAPTER XIX,possible from the false and showy splendour which he wished to explode.
7590,CHAPTER XIX,"It is possible, that this predilection, at first merely comparative,"
7591,CHAPTER XIX,deviated for a time into direct partiality. But the real object which
7592,CHAPTER XIX,"he had in view, was, I doubt not, a species of excellence which had"
7593,CHAPTER XIX,been long before most happily characterized by the judicious and amiable
7594,CHAPTER XIX,"Garve, whose works are so justly beloved and esteemed by the Germans,"
7595,CHAPTER XIX,"in his remarks on Gellert, from which the following is literally"
7596,CHAPTER XIX,"translated. “The talent, that is required in order to make, excellent"
7597,CHAPTER XIX,"verses, is perhaps greater than the philosopher is ready to admit, or"
7598,CHAPTER XIX,would find it in his power to acquire: the talent to seek only the apt
7599,CHAPTER XIX,"expression of the thought, and yet to find at the same time with it the"
7600,CHAPTER XIX,"rhyme and the metre. Gellert possessed this happy gift, if ever any one"
7601,CHAPTER XIX,of our poets possessed it; and nothing perhaps contributed more to the
7602,CHAPTER XIX,great and universal impression which his fables made on their first
7603,CHAPTER XIX,"publication, or conduces more to their continued popularity. It was"
7604,CHAPTER XIX,"a strange and curious phaenomenon, and such as in Germany had been"
7605,CHAPTER XIX,"previously unheard of, to read verses in which everything was expressed"
7606,CHAPTER XIX,"just as one would wish to talk, and yet all dignified, attractive,"
7607,CHAPTER XIX,and interesting; and all at the same time perfectly correct as to the
7608,CHAPTER XIX,"measure of the syllables and the rhyme. It is certain, that poetry when"
7609,CHAPTER XIX,it has attained this excellence makes a far greater impression than
7610,CHAPTER XIX,"prose. So much so indeed, that even the gratification which the very"
7611,CHAPTER XIX,"rhymes afford, becomes then no longer a contemptible or trifling"
7612,CHAPTER XIX,gratification.” [71]
7613,CHAPTER XIX,
7614,CHAPTER XIX,However novel this phaenomenon may have been in Germany at the time
7615,CHAPTER XIX,"of Gellert, it is by no means new, nor yet of recent existence in our"
7616,CHAPTER XIX,language. Spite of the licentiousness with which Spenser occasionally
7617,CHAPTER XIX,"compels the orthography of his words into a subservience to his rhymes,"
7618,CHAPTER XIX,the whole FAIRY QUEEN is an almost continued instance of this beauty.
7619,CHAPTER XIX,"Waller’s song GO, LOVELY ROSE, is doubtless familiar to most of my"
7620,CHAPTER XIX,"readers; but if I had happened to have had by me the Poems of Cotton,"
7621,CHAPTER XIX,more but far less deservedly celebrated as the author of the VIRGIL
7622,CHAPTER XIX,"TRAVESTIED, I should have indulged myself, and I think have gratified"
7623,CHAPTER XIX,"many, who are not acquainted with his serious works, by selecting some"
7624,CHAPTER XIX,admirable specimens of this style. There are not a few poems in that
7625,CHAPTER XIX,"volume, replete with every excellence of thought, image, and passion,"
7626,CHAPTER XIX,which we expect or desire in the poetry of the milder muse; and yet so
7627,CHAPTER XIX,"worded, that the reader sees no one reason either in the selection or"
7628,CHAPTER XIX,"the order of the words, why he might not have said the very same in an"
7629,CHAPTER XIX,"appropriate conversation, and cannot conceive how indeed he could have"
7630,CHAPTER XIX,expressed such thoughts otherwise without loss or injury to his meaning.
7631,CHAPTER XIX,
7632,CHAPTER XIX,"But in truth our language is, and from the first dawn of poetry ever"
7633,CHAPTER XIX,"has been, particularly rich in compositions distinguished by this"
7634,CHAPTER XIX,"excellence. The final e, which is now mute, in Chaucer’s age was either"
7635,CHAPTER XIX,sounded or dropt indifferently. We ourselves still use either “beloved”
7636,CHAPTER XIX,"or “belov’d” according as the rhyme, or measure, or the purpose of"
7637,CHAPTER XIX,more or less solemnity may require. Let the reader then only adopt the
7638,CHAPTER XIX,"pronunciation of the poet and of the court, at which he lived, both with"
7639,CHAPTER XIX,respect to the final e and to the accentuation of the last syllable;
7640,CHAPTER XIX,"I would then venture to ask, what even in the colloquial language of"
7641,CHAPTER XIX,"elegant and unaffected women, (who are the peculiar mistresses of “pure"
7642,CHAPTER XIX,"English and undefiled,”) what could we hear more natural, or seemingly"
7643,CHAPTER XIX,"more unstudied, than the following stanzas from Chaucer’s TROILUS AND"

7690,CRESEIDE.,"I shall be glad, if al the world be trewe!”"
7691,CRESEIDE.,
7692,CRESEIDE.,"Another exquisite master of this species of style, where the scholar and"
7693,CRESEIDE.,"the poet supplies the material, but the perfect well-bred gentleman the"
7694,CRESEIDE.,"expressions and the arrangement, is George Herbert. As from the nature"
7695,CRESEIDE.,"of the subject, and the too frequent quaintness of the thoughts, his"
7696,CRESEIDE.,TEMPLE; or SACRED POEMS AND PRIVATE EJACULATIONS are Comparatively but
7697,CRESEIDE.,"little known, I shall extract two poems. The first is a sonnet, equally"
7698,CRESEIDE.,"admirable for the weight, number, and expression of the thoughts, and"
7699,CRESEIDE.,"for the simple dignity of the language. Unless, indeed, a fastidious"
7700,CRESEIDE.,taste should object to the latter half of the sixth line. The second is
7701,CRESEIDE.,"a poem of greater length, which I have chosen not only for the present"
7702,CRESEIDE.,"purpose, but likewise as a striking example and illustration of an"
7703,CRESEIDE.,"assertion hazarded in a former page of these sketches namely, that the"
7704,CRESEIDE.,"characteristic fault of our elder poets is the reverse of that, which"
7705,CRESEIDE.,distinguishes too many of our more recent versifiers; the one conveying
7706,CRESEIDE.,the most fantastic thoughts in the most correct and natural language;
7707,CRESEIDE.,the other in the most fantastic language conveying the most trivial
7708,CRESEIDE.,thoughts. The latter is a riddle of words; the former an enigma of
7709,CRESEIDE.,thoughts. The one reminds me of an odd passage in Drayton’s IDEAS
7710,CRESEIDE.,
7711,CRESEIDE.,"As other men, so I myself do muse,"
7712,CRESEIDE.,Why in this sort I wrest invention so;
7713,CRESEIDE.,"And why these giddy metaphors I use,"
7714,CRESEIDE.,Leaving the path the greater part do go;
7715,CRESEIDE.,I will resolve you: I am lunatic! [72]
7716,CRESEIDE.,
7717,CRESEIDE.,The other recalls a still odder passage in THE SYNAGOGUE: or THE SHADOW
7718,CRESEIDE.,"OF THE TEMPLE, a connected series of poems in imitation of Herbert’s"
7719,CRESEIDE.,"TEMPLE, and, in some editions, annexed to it."
7720,CRESEIDE.,
7721,CRESEIDE.,O how my mind
7722,CRESEIDE.,Is gravell’d!
7723,CRESEIDE.,"Not a thought,"
7724,CRESEIDE.,"That I can find,"
7725,CRESEIDE.,But’s ravell’d
7726,CRESEIDE.,All to nought!
7727,CRESEIDE.,"Short ends of threds,"
7728,CRESEIDE.,And narrow shreds
7729,CRESEIDE.,"Of lists,"
7730,CRESEIDE.,"Knots, snarled ruffs,"
7731,CRESEIDE.,Loose broken tufts
7732,CRESEIDE.,"Of twists,"
7733,CRESEIDE.,"Are my torn meditations ragged clothing,"
7734,CRESEIDE.,"Which, wound and woven, shape a suit for nothing:"
7735,CRESEIDE.,"One while I think, and then I am in pain"
7736,CRESEIDE.,To think how to unthink that thought again.
7737,CRESEIDE.,
7738,CRESEIDE.,Immediately after these burlesque passages I cannot proceed to the
7739,CRESEIDE.,"extracts promised, without changing the ludicrous tone of feeling by the"
7740,CRESEIDE.,interposition of the three following stanzas of Herbert’s.

7781,LOVE UNKNOWN.,
7782,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Dear friend, sit down, the tale is long and sad"
7783,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"And in my faintings, I presume, your love"
7784,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Will more comply than help. A Lord I had,"
7785,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"And have, of whom some grounds, which may improve,"
7786,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"I hold for two lives, and both lives in me."
7787,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"To him I brought a dish of fruit one day,"
7788,LOVE UNKNOWN.,And in the middle placed my heart. But he
7789,LOVE UNKNOWN.,(I sigh to say)
7790,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Look’d on a servant, who did know his eye,"
7791,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Better than you know me, or (which is one)"
7792,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Than I myself. The servant instantly,"
7793,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Quitting the fruit, seiz’d on my heart alone,"
7794,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"And threw it in a font, wherein did fall"
7795,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"A stream of blood, which issued from the side"
7796,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Of a great rock: I well remember all,"
7797,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"And have good cause: there it was dipt and dyed,"
7798,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"And wash’d, and wrung: the very wringing yet"
7799,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Enforceth tears. “Your heart was foul, I fear.”"
7800,LOVE UNKNOWN.,Indeed ’tis true. I did and do commit
7801,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Many a fault, more than my lease will bear;"
7802,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Yet still ask’d pardon, and was not denied."
7803,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"But you shall hear. After my heart was well,"
7804,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"And clean and fair, as I one eventide"
7805,LOVE UNKNOWN.,(I sigh to tell)
7806,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Walk’d by myself abroad, I saw a large"
7807,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"And spacious furnace flaming, and thereon"
7808,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"A boiling caldron, round about whose verge"
7809,LOVE UNKNOWN.,Was in great letters set AFFLICTION.
7810,LOVE UNKNOWN.,The greatness shew’d the owner. So I went
7811,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"To fetch a sacrifice out of my fold,"
7812,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Thinking with that, which I did thus present,"
7813,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"To warm his love, which, I did fear, grew cold."
7814,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"But as my heart did tender it, the man"
7815,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Who was to take it from me, slipt his hand,"
7816,LOVE UNKNOWN.,And threw my heart into the scalding pan;
7817,LOVE UNKNOWN.,My heart that brought it (do you understand?)
7818,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"The offerer’s heart. “Your heart was hard, I fear.”"
7819,LOVE UNKNOWN.,Indeed ’tis true. I found a callous matter
7820,LOVE UNKNOWN.,Began to spread and to expatiate there:
7821,LOVE UNKNOWN.,But with a richer drug than scalding water
7822,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"I bath’d it often, ev’n with holy blood,"
7823,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Which at a board, while many drank bare wine,"
7824,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"A friend did steal into my cup for good,"
7825,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Ev’n taken inwardly, and most divine"
7826,LOVE UNKNOWN.,To supple hardnesses. But at the length
7827,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Out of the caldron getting, soon I fled"
7828,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Unto my house, where to repair the strength"
7829,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Which I had lost, I hasted to my bed:"
7830,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"But when I thought to sleep out all these faults,"
7831,LOVE UNKNOWN.,(I sigh to speak)
7832,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"I found that some had stuff’d the bed with thoughts,"
7833,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"I would say thorns. Dear, could my heart not break,"
7834,LOVE UNKNOWN.,When with my pleasures ev’n my rest was gone?
7835,LOVE UNKNOWN.,Full well I understood who had been there:
7836,LOVE UNKNOWN.,For I had given the key to none but one:
7837,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"It must be he. “Your heart was dull, I fear.”"
7838,LOVE UNKNOWN.,Indeed a slack and sleepy state of mind
7839,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Did oft possess me; so that when I pray’d,"
7840,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Though my lips went, my heart did stay behind."
7841,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"But all my scores were by another paid,"
7842,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"Who took my guilt upon him. “Truly, Friend,"
7843,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"“For aught I hear, your Master shews to you"
7844,LOVE UNKNOWN.,“More favour than you wot of. Mark the end.
7845,LOVE UNKNOWN.,“The font did only what was old renew
7846,LOVE UNKNOWN.,“The caldron suppled what was grown too hard:
7847,LOVE UNKNOWN.,“The thorns did quicken what was grown too dull:
7848,LOVE UNKNOWN.,“All did but strive to mend what you had marr’d.
7849,LOVE UNKNOWN.,"“Wherefore be cheer’d, and praise him to the full"

7856,CHAPTER XX,CHAPTER XX
7857,CHAPTER XX,
7858,CHAPTER XX,"The former subject continued--The neutral style, or that common to Prose"
7859,CHAPTER XX,"and Poetry, exemplified by specimens from Chaucer, Herbert, and others."
7860,CHAPTER XX,
7861,CHAPTER XX,
7862,CHAPTER XX,"I have no fear in declaring my conviction, that the excellence defined"
7863,CHAPTER XX,and exemplified in the preceding chapter is not the characteristic
7864,CHAPTER XX,excellence of Mr. Wordsworth’s style; because I can add with equal
7865,CHAPTER XX,"sincerity, that it is precluded by higher powers. The praise of uniform"
7866,CHAPTER XX,"adherence to genuine, logical English is undoubtedly his; nay, laying"
7867,CHAPTER XX,"the main emphasis on the word uniform, I will dare add that, of all"
7868,CHAPTER XX,"contemporary poets, it is his alone. For, in a less absolute sense of"
7869,CHAPTER XX,"the word, I should certainly include Mr. Bowies, Lord Byron, and, as to"
7870,CHAPTER XX,"all his later writings, Mr. Southey, the exceptions in their works being"
7871,CHAPTER XX,so few and unimportant. But of the specific excellence described in
7872,CHAPTER XX,"the quotation from Garve, I appear to find more, and more undoubted"
7873,CHAPTER XX,"specimens in the works of others; for instance, among the minor poems of"
7874,CHAPTER XX,"Mr. Thomas Moore, and of our illustrious Laureate. To me it will always"
7875,CHAPTER XX,"remain a singular and noticeable fact; that a theory, which would"
7876,CHAPTER XX,"establish this lingua communis, not only as the best, but as the only"
7877,CHAPTER XX,"commendable style, should have proceeded from a poet, whose diction,"
7878,CHAPTER XX,"next to that of Shakespeare and Milton, appears to me of all others the"
7879,CHAPTER XX,"most individualized and characteristic. And let it be remembered too,"
7880,CHAPTER XX,that I am now interpreting the controverted passages of Mr. Wordsworth’s
7881,CHAPTER XX,"critical preface by the purpose and object, which he may be supposed to"
7882,CHAPTER XX,"have intended, rather than by the sense which the words themselves must"
7883,CHAPTER XX,"convey, if they are taken without this allowance."
7884,CHAPTER XX,
7885,CHAPTER XX,"A person of any taste, who had but studied three or four of"
7886,CHAPTER XX,"Shakespeare’s principal plays, would without the name affixed scarcely"
7887,CHAPTER XX,"fail to recognise as Shakespeare’s a quotation from any other play,"
7888,CHAPTER XX,"though but of a few lines. A similar peculiarity, though in a less"
7889,CHAPTER XX,"degree, attends Mr. Wordsworth’s style, whenever he speaks in his own"
7890,CHAPTER XX,"person; or whenever, though under a feigned name, it is clear that he"
7891,CHAPTER XX,"himself is still speaking, as in the different dramatis personae of"
7892,CHAPTER XX,"THE RECLUSE. Even in the other poems, in which he purposes to be most"
7893,CHAPTER XX,"dramatic, there are few in which it does not occasionally burst forth."
7894,CHAPTER XX,The reader might often address the poet in his own words with reference
7895,CHAPTER XX,to the persons introduced:
7896,CHAPTER XX,
7897,CHAPTER XX,"“It seems, as I retrace the ballad line by line"
7898,CHAPTER XX,"That but half of it is theirs, and the better half is thine.”"
7899,CHAPTER XX,
7900,CHAPTER XX,"Who, having been previously acquainted with any considerable portion"
7901,CHAPTER XX,"of Mr. Wordsworth’s publications, and having studied them with a full"
7902,CHAPTER XX,"feeling of the author’s genius, would not at once claim as Wordsworthian"
7903,CHAPTER XX,the little poem on the rainbow?
7904,CHAPTER XX,
7905,CHAPTER XX,"“The Child is father of the Man, etc.”"
7906,CHAPTER XX,
7907,CHAPTER XX,Or in the LUCY GRAY?
7908,CHAPTER XX,
7909,CHAPTER XX,"“No mate, no comrade Lucy knew;"
7910,CHAPTER XX,She dwelt on a wide moor;
7911,CHAPTER XX,The sweetest thing that ever grew
7912,CHAPTER XX,Beside a human door.”
7913,CHAPTER XX,
7914,CHAPTER XX,Or in the IDLE SHEPHERD-BOYS?
7915,CHAPTER XX,
7916,CHAPTER XX,“Along the river’s stony marge
7917,CHAPTER XX,The sand-lark chants a joyous song;
7918,CHAPTER XX,"The thrush is busy in the wood,"
7919,CHAPTER XX,And carols loud and strong.
7920,CHAPTER XX,"A thousand lambs are on the rocks,"
7921,CHAPTER XX,All newly born! both earth and sky
7922,CHAPTER XX,"Keep jubilee, and more than all,"
7923,CHAPTER XX,Those boys with their green coronal;
7924,CHAPTER XX,"They never hear the cry,"
7925,CHAPTER XX,That plaintive cry! which up the hill
7926,CHAPTER XX,Comes from the depth of Dungeon-Ghyll.”
7927,CHAPTER XX,
7928,CHAPTER XX,Need I mention the exquisite description of the Sea-Loch in THE BLIND
7929,CHAPTER XX,HIGHLAND BOY. Who but a poet tells a tale in such language to the little
7930,CHAPTER XX,ones by the fire-side as--
7931,CHAPTER XX,
7932,CHAPTER XX,“Yet had he many a restless dream;
7933,CHAPTER XX,"Both when he heard the eagle’s scream,"
7934,CHAPTER XX,"And when he heard the torrents roar,"
7935,CHAPTER XX,And heard the water beat the shore
7936,CHAPTER XX,Near where their cottage stood.
7937,CHAPTER XX,
7938,CHAPTER XX,"Beside a lake their cottage stood,"
7939,CHAPTER XX,"Not small like our’s, a peaceful flood;"
7940,CHAPTER XX,"But one of mighty size, and strange;"
7941,CHAPTER XX,"That, rough or smooth, is full of change,"
7942,CHAPTER XX,And stirring in its bed.
7943,CHAPTER XX,
7944,CHAPTER XX,"For to this lake, by night and day,"
7945,CHAPTER XX,The great Sea-water finds its way
7946,CHAPTER XX,"Through long, long windings of the hills,"
7947,CHAPTER XX,And drinks up all the pretty rills
7948,CHAPTER XX,And rivers large and strong:
7949,CHAPTER XX,
7950,CHAPTER XX,Then hurries back the road it came
7951,CHAPTER XX,Returns on errand still the same;
7952,CHAPTER XX,This did it when the earth was new;
7953,CHAPTER XX,"And this for evermore will do,"
7954,CHAPTER XX,As long as earth shall last.
7955,CHAPTER XX,
7956,CHAPTER XX,"And, with the coming of the tide,"
7957,CHAPTER XX,"Come boats and ships that sweetly ride,"
7958,CHAPTER XX,Between the woods and lofty rocks;
7959,CHAPTER XX,And to the shepherds with their flocks
7960,CHAPTER XX,Bring tales of distant lands.”
7961,CHAPTER XX,
7962,CHAPTER XX,"I might quote almost the whole of his RUTH, but take the following"
7963,CHAPTER XX,stanzas:
7964,CHAPTER XX,
7965,CHAPTER XX,"But, as you have before been told,"
7966,CHAPTER XX,"This Stripling, sportive, gay, and bold,"
7967,CHAPTER XX,"And, with his dancing crest,"
7968,CHAPTER XX,"So beautiful, through savage lands"
7969,CHAPTER XX,Had roamed about with vagrant bands
7970,CHAPTER XX,Of Indians in the West.
7971,CHAPTER XX,
7972,CHAPTER XX,"The wind, the tempest roaring high,"
7973,CHAPTER XX,"The tumult of a tropic sky,"
7974,CHAPTER XX,Might well be dangerous food
7975,CHAPTER XX,"For him, a Youth to whom was given"
7976,CHAPTER XX,"So much of earth--so much of heaven,"
7977,CHAPTER XX,And such impetuous blood.
7978,CHAPTER XX,
7979,CHAPTER XX,Whatever in those climes he found
7980,CHAPTER XX,Irregular in sight or sound
7981,CHAPTER XX,Did to his mind impart
7982,CHAPTER XX,"A kindred impulse, seemed allied"
7983,CHAPTER XX,"To his own powers, and justified"
7984,CHAPTER XX,The workings of his heart.
7985,CHAPTER XX,
7986,CHAPTER XX,"Nor less, to feed voluptuous thought,"
7987,CHAPTER XX,"The beauteous forms of nature wrought,"
7988,CHAPTER XX,Fair trees and lovely flowers;
7989,CHAPTER XX,The breezes their own languor lent;
7990,CHAPTER XX,"The stars had feelings, which they sent"
7991,CHAPTER XX,Into those magic bowers.
7992,CHAPTER XX,
7993,CHAPTER XX,"Yet in his worst pursuits, I ween,"
7994,CHAPTER XX,That sometimes there did intervene
7995,CHAPTER XX,Pure hopes of high intent
7996,CHAPTER XX,For passions linked to forms so fair
7997,CHAPTER XX,"And stately, needs must have their share"
7998,CHAPTER XX,Of noble sentiment.”
7999,CHAPTER XX,
8000,CHAPTER XX,"But from Mr. Wordsworth’s more elevated compositions, which already form"
8001,CHAPTER XX,"three-fourths of his works; and will, I trust, constitute hereafter a"
8002,CHAPTER XX,"still larger proportion;--from these, whether in rhyme or blank verse,"
8003,CHAPTER XX,it would be difficult and almost superfluous to select instances of a
8004,CHAPTER XX,"diction peculiarly his own, of a style which cannot be imitated without"
8005,CHAPTER XX,"its being at once recognised, as originating in Mr. Wordsworth. It would"
8006,CHAPTER XX,"not be easy to open on any one of his loftier strains, that does not"
8007,CHAPTER XX,contain examples of this; and more in proportion as the lines are more
8008,CHAPTER XX,"excellent, and most like the author. For those, who may happen to have"
8009,CHAPTER XX,"been less familiar with his writings, I will give three specimens"
8010,CHAPTER XX,taken with little choice. The first from the lines on the BOY OF
8011,CHAPTER XX,"WINANDER-MERE,--who"
8012,CHAPTER XX,
8013,CHAPTER XX,"“Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls,"
8014,CHAPTER XX,That they might answer him.--And they would shout
8015,CHAPTER XX,"Across the watery vale, and shout again,"
8016,CHAPTER XX,"With long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud"
8017,CHAPTER XX,Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild
8018,CHAPTER XX,"Of mirth and jocund din! And when it chanced,"
8019,CHAPTER XX,"That pauses of deep silence mocked his skill,"
8020,CHAPTER XX,"Then sometimes in that silence, while he hung"
8021,CHAPTER XX,"Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise"
8022,CHAPTER XX,Has carried far into his heart the voice
8023,CHAPTER XX,Of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene [73]
8024,CHAPTER XX,Would enter unawares into his mind
8025,CHAPTER XX,"With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,"
8026,CHAPTER XX,"Its woods, and that uncertain heaven, received"
8027,CHAPTER XX,Into the bosom of the steady lake.”
8028,CHAPTER XX,
8029,CHAPTER XX,The second shall be that noble imitation of Drayton [74] (if it was not
8030,CHAPTER XX,rather a coincidence) in the lines TO JOANNA.
8031,CHAPTER XX,
8032,CHAPTER XX,"--“When I had gazed perhaps two minutes’ space,"
8033,CHAPTER XX,"Joanna, looking in my eyes, beheld"
8034,CHAPTER XX,"That ravishment of mine, and laughed aloud."
8035,CHAPTER XX,"The Rock, like something starting from a sleep,"
8036,CHAPTER XX,"Took up the Lady’s voice, and laughed again!"
8037,CHAPTER XX,That ancient woman seated on Helm-crag
8038,CHAPTER XX,Was ready with her cavern; Hammar-scar
8039,CHAPTER XX,And the tall Steep of Silver-How sent forth
8040,CHAPTER XX,"A noise of laughter; southern Lougbrigg heard,"
8041,CHAPTER XX,And Fairfield answered with a mountain tone.
8042,CHAPTER XX,Helvellyn far into the clear blue sky
8043,CHAPTER XX,Carried the lady’s voice!--old Skiddaw blew
8044,CHAPTER XX,His speaking trumpet!--back out of the clouds
8045,CHAPTER XX,From Glaramara southward came the voice:
8046,CHAPTER XX,And Kirkstone tossed it from its misty head!”
8047,CHAPTER XX,
8048,CHAPTER XX,"The third, which is in rhyme, I take from the SONG AT THE FEAST OF"
8049,CHAPTER XX,"BROUGHAM CASTLE, upon the restoration of Lord Clifford, the Shepherd, to"
8050,CHAPTER XX,the Estates and Honours of his Ancestors.
8051,CHAPTER XX,
8052,CHAPTER XX,"------“Now another day is come,"
8053,CHAPTER XX,"Fitter hope, and nobler doom;"
8054,CHAPTER XX,"He hath thrown aside his crook,"
8055,CHAPTER XX,And hath buried deep his book;
8056,CHAPTER XX,Armour rusting in his halls

8063,CHAPTER XX,Groan thou with our victory!
8064,CHAPTER XX,"Happy day, and mighty hour,"
8065,CHAPTER XX,"When our Shepherd, in his power,"
8066,CHAPTER XX,"Mailed and horsed, with lance and sword,"
8067,CHAPTER XX,"To his ancestors restored,"
8068,CHAPTER XX,"Like a re-appearing Star,"

8072,CHAPTER XX,"“Alas! the fervent harper did not know,"

8078,CHAPTER XX,"His daily teachers had been woods and rills,"

8081,CHAPTER XX,
8082,CHAPTER XX,"The words themselves in the foregoing extracts, are, no doubt,"
8083,CHAPTER XX,sufficiently common for the greater part.--But in what poem are they not
8084,CHAPTER XX,"so, if we except a few misadventurous attempts to translate the arts"
8085,CHAPTER XX,and sciences into verse? In THE EXCURSION the number of polysyllabic
8086,CHAPTER XX,"(or what the common people call, dictionary) words is more than usually"
8087,CHAPTER XX,"great. And so must it needs be, in proportion to the number and variety"
8088,CHAPTER XX,"of an author’s conceptions, and his solicitude to express them with"
8089,CHAPTER XX,precision.--But are those words in those places commonly employed in
8090,CHAPTER XX,real life to express the same thought or outward thing? Are they the
8091,CHAPTER XX,style used in the ordinary intercourse of spoken words? No! nor are the
8092,CHAPTER XX,modes of connections; and still less the breaks and transitions. Would
8093,CHAPTER XX,any but a poet--at least could any one without being conscious that he
8094,CHAPTER XX,had expressed himself with noticeable vivacity--have described a bird
8095,CHAPTER XX,"singing loud by, “The thrush is busy in the wood?”--or have spoken of"
8096,CHAPTER XX,"boys with a string of club-moss round their rusty hats, as the boys"
8097,CHAPTER XX,“with their green coronal?”--or have translated a beautiful May-day into
8098,CHAPTER XX,“Both earth and sky keep jubilee!”--or have brought all the different
8099,CHAPTER XX,"marks and circumstances of a sealoch before the mind, as the actions of"
8100,CHAPTER XX,a living and acting power? Or have represented the reflection of the sky
8101,CHAPTER XX,"in the water, as “That uncertain heaven received into the bosom of the"
8102,CHAPTER XX,steady lake?” Even the grammatical construction is not unfrequently
8103,CHAPTER XX,"peculiar; as “The wind, the tempest roaring high, the tumult of a tropic"
8104,CHAPTER XX,"sky, might well be dangerous food to him, a youth to whom was given,"
8105,CHAPTER XX,etc.” There is a peculiarity in the frequent use of the asymartaeton
8106,CHAPTER XX,"(that is, the omission of the connective particle before the last of"
8107,CHAPTER XX,"several words, or several sentences used grammatically as single words,"
8108,CHAPTER XX,all being in the same case and governing or governed by the same verb)
8109,CHAPTER XX,"and not less in the construction of words by apposition (“to him, a"
8110,CHAPTER XX,"youth”). In short, were there excluded from Mr. Wordsworth’s poetic"
8111,CHAPTER XX,"compositions all, that a literal adherence to the theory of his preface"
8112,CHAPTER XX,"would exclude, two thirds at least of the marked beauties of his poetry"
8113,CHAPTER XX,must be erased. For a far greater number of lines would be sacrificed
8114,CHAPTER XX,than in any other recent poet; because the pleasure received from
8115,CHAPTER XX,Wordsworth’s poems being less derived either from excitement of
8116,CHAPTER XX,"curiosity or the rapid flow of narration, the striking passages form a"
8117,CHAPTER XX,larger proportion of their value. I do not adduce it as a fair criterion
8118,CHAPTER XX,"of comparative excellence, nor do I even think it such; but merely as"
8119,CHAPTER XX,"matter of fact. I affirm, that from no contemporary writer could so many"
8120,CHAPTER XX,"lines be quoted, without reference to the poem in which they are found,"
8121,CHAPTER XX,for their own independent weight or beauty. From the sphere of my own
8122,CHAPTER XX,experience I can bring to my recollection three persons of no every-day
8123,CHAPTER XX,"powers and acquirements, who had read the poems of others with more and"
8124,CHAPTER XX,"more unallayed pleasure, and had thought more highly of their authors,"
8125,CHAPTER XX,"as poets; who yet have confessed to me, that from no modern work had so"
8126,CHAPTER XX,"many passages started up anew in their minds at different times, and as"
8127,CHAPTER XX,different occasions had awakened a meditative mood.

8137,CHAPTER XXI,Long have I wished to see a fair and philosophical inquisition into the
8138,CHAPTER XXI,"character of Wordsworth, as a poet, on the evidence of his published"
8139,CHAPTER XXI,"works; and a positive, not a comparative, appreciation of their"
8140,CHAPTER XXI,"characteristic excellencies, deficiencies, and defects. I know no claim"
8141,CHAPTER XXI,that the mere opinion of any individual can have to weigh down the
8142,CHAPTER XXI,opinion of the author himself; against the probability of whose parental
8143,CHAPTER XXI,partiality we ought to set that of his having thought longer and more
8144,CHAPTER XXI,deeply on the subject. But I should call that investigation fair and
8145,CHAPTER XXI,philosophical in which the critic announces and endeavours to establish
8146,CHAPTER XXI,"the principles, which he holds for the foundation of poetry in general,"
8147,CHAPTER XXI,with the specification of these in their application to the different
8148,CHAPTER XXI,classes of poetry. Having thus prepared his canons of criticism for
8149,CHAPTER XXI,"praise and condemnation, he would proceed to particularize the most"
8150,CHAPTER XXI,"striking passages to which he deems them applicable, faithfully noticing"
8151,CHAPTER XXI,"the frequent or infrequent recurrence of similar merits or defects,"
8152,CHAPTER XXI,and as faithfully distinguishing what is characteristic from what is
8153,CHAPTER XXI,"accidental, or a mere flagging of the wing. Then if his premises be"
8154,CHAPTER XXI,"rational, his deductions legitimate, and his conclusions justly applied,"
8155,CHAPTER XXI,"the reader, and possibly the poet himself, may adopt his judgment in"
8156,CHAPTER XXI,the light of judgment and in the independence of free-agency. If he has
8157,CHAPTER XXI,"erred, he presents his errors in a definite place and tangible form, and"
8158,CHAPTER XXI,holds the torch and guides the way to their detection.

8160,CHAPTER XXI,"I most willingly admit, and estimate at a high value, the services which"
8161,CHAPTER XXI,"the EDINBURGH REVIEW, and others formed afterwards on the same plan,"
8162,CHAPTER XXI,have rendered to society in the diffusion of knowledge. I think the
8163,CHAPTER XXI,commencement of the EDINBURGH REVIEW an important epoch in periodical
8164,CHAPTER XXI,criticism; and that it has a claim upon the gratitude of the literary
8165,CHAPTER XXI,"republic, and indeed of the reading public at large, for having"
8166,CHAPTER XXI,"originated the scheme of reviewing those books only, which are"
8167,CHAPTER XXI,susceptible and deserving of argumentative criticism. Not less
8168,CHAPTER XXI,"meritorious, and far more faithfully and in general far more ably"
8169,CHAPTER XXI,"executed, is their plan of supplying the vacant place of the trash or"
8170,CHAPTER XXI,"mediocrity, wisely left to sink into oblivion by its own weight, with"
8171,CHAPTER XXI,"original essays on the most interesting subjects of the time, religious,"
8172,CHAPTER XXI,or political; in which the titles of the books or pamphlets prefixed
8173,CHAPTER XXI,furnish only the name and occasion of the disquisition. I do not arraign
8174,CHAPTER XXI,"the keenness, or asperity of its damnatory style, in and for itself, as"
8175,CHAPTER XXI,long as the author is addressed or treated as the mere impersonation of
8176,CHAPTER XXI,"the work then under trial. I have no quarrel with them on this account,"
8177,CHAPTER XXI,"as long as no personal allusions are admitted, and no re-commitment"
8178,CHAPTER XXI,"(for new trial) of juvenile performances, that were published, perhaps"
8179,CHAPTER XXI,"forgotten, many years before the commencement of the review: since for"
8180,CHAPTER XXI,the forcing back of such works to public notice no motives are easily
8181,CHAPTER XXI,"assignable, but such as are furnished to the critic by his own personal"
8182,CHAPTER XXI,"malignity; or what is still worse, by a habit of malignity in the form"
8183,CHAPTER XXI,of mere wantonness.

8192,S. T. C.,"Every censure, every sarcasm respecting a publication which the critic,"
8193,S. T. C.,"with the criticised work before him, can make good, is the critic’s"
8194,S. T. C.,"right. The writer is authorized to reply, but not to complain. Neither"
8195,S. T. C.,"can anyone prescribe to the critic, how soft or how hard; how friendly,"
8196,S. T. C.,"or how bitter, shall be the phrases which he is to select for the"
8197,S. T. C.,"expression of such reprehension or ridicule. The critic must know, what"
8198,S. T. C.,effect it is his object to produce; and with a view to this effect must
8199,S. T. C.,"he weigh his words. But as soon as the critic betrays, that he knows"
8200,S. T. C.,"more of his author, than the author’s publications could have told him;"
8201,S. T. C.,"as soon as from this more intimate knowledge, elsewhere obtained, he"
8202,S. T. C.,avails himself of the slightest trait against the author; his censure
8203,S. T. C.,"instantly becomes personal injury, his sarcasms personal insults. He"
8204,S. T. C.,"ceases to be a critic, and takes on him the most contemptible character"
8205,S. T. C.,"to which a rational creature can be degraded, that of a gossip,"
8206,S. T. C.,"backbiter, and pasquillant: but with this heavy aggravation, that he"
8207,S. T. C.,"steals the unquiet, the deforming passions of the world into the museum;"
8208,S. T. C.,"into the very place which, next to the chapel and oratory, should be our"
8209,S. T. C.,"sanctuary, and secure place of refuge; offers abominations on the altar"
8210,S. T. C.,of the Muses; and makes its sacred paling the very circle in which he
8211,S. T. C.,conjures up the lying and profane spirit.
8212,S. T. C.,
8213,S. T. C.,"This determination of unlicensed personality, and of permitted and"
8214,S. T. C.,"legitimate censure, (which I owe in part to the illustrious Lessing,"
8215,S. T. C.,"himself a model of acute, spirited, sometimes stinging, but always"
8216,S. T. C.,"argumentative and honourable, criticism) is beyond controversy the"
8217,S. T. C.,true one: and though I would not myself exercise all the rights of the
8218,S. T. C.,"latter, yet, let but the former be excluded, I submit myself to"
8219,S. T. C.,"its exercise in the hands of others, without complaint and without"
8220,S. T. C.,resentment.

8222,S. T. C.,Let a communication be formed between any number of learned men in the
8223,S. T. C.,various branches of science and literature; and whether the president
8224,S. T. C.,"and central committee be in London, or Edinburgh, if only they"
8225,S. T. C.,"previously lay aside their individuality, and pledge themselves"
8226,S. T. C.,"inwardly, as well as ostensibly, to administer judgment according to"
8227,S. T. C.,a constitution and code of laws; and if by grounding this code on the
8228,S. T. C.,"two-fold basis of universal morals and philosophic reason, independent"
8229,S. T. C.,"of all foreseen application to particular works and authors, they obtain"
8230,S. T. C.,the right to speak each as the representative of their body corporate;
8231,S. T. C.,"they shall have honour and good wishes from me, and I shall accord to"
8232,S. T. C.,"them their fair dignities, though self-assumed, not less cheerfully than"
8233,S. T. C.,"if I could inquire concerning them in the herald’s office, or turn"
8234,S. T. C.,to them in the book of peerage. However loud may be the outcries for
8235,S. T. C.,"prevented or subverted reputation, however numerous and impatient the"
8236,S. T. C.,"complaints of merciless severity and insupportable despotism, I shall"
8237,S. T. C.,"neither feel, nor utter aught but to the defence and justification of"
8238,S. T. C.,the critical machine. Should any literary Quixote find himself provoked
8239,S. T. C.,"by its sounds and regular movements, I should admonish him with Sancho"
8240,S. T. C.,"Panza, that it is no giant but a windmill; there it stands on its own"
8241,S. T. C.,"place, and its own hillock, never goes out of its way to attack anyone,"
8242,S. T. C.,and to none and from none either gives or asks assistance. When
8243,S. T. C.,the public press has poured in any part of its produce between its
8244,S. T. C.,"mill-stones, it grinds it off, one man’s sack the same as another, and"
8245,S. T. C.,with whatever wind may happen to be then blowing. All the two-and-thirty
8246,S. T. C.,winds are alike its friends. Of the whole wide atmosphere it does not
8247,S. T. C.,desire a single finger-breadth more than what is necessary for its sails
8248,S. T. C.,"to turn round in. But this space must be left free and unimpeded. Gnats,"
8249,S. T. C.,"beetles, wasps, butterflies, and the whole tribe of ephemerals and"
8250,S. T. C.,"insignificants, may flit in and out and between; may hum, and buzz, and"
8251,S. T. C.,"jar; may shrill their tiny pipes, and wind their puny horns, unchastised"
8252,S. T. C.,and unnoticed. But idlers and bravadoes of larger size and prouder show
8253,S. T. C.,"must beware, how they place themselves within its sweep. Much less may"
8254,S. T. C.,"they presume to lay hands on the sails, the strength of which is"
8255,S. T. C.,"neither greater nor less than as the wind is, which drives them round."
8256,S. T. C.,"Whomsoever the remorseless arm slings aloft, or whirls along with it in"
8257,S. T. C.,"the air, he has himself alone to blame; though, when the same arm throws"
8258,S. T. C.,"him from it, it will more often double than break the force of his fall."
8259,S. T. C.,
8260,S. T. C.,Putting aside the too manifest and too frequent interference of national
8261,S. T. C.,"party, and even personal predilection or aversion; and reserving for"
8262,S. T. C.,deeper feelings those worse and more criminal intrusions into the
8263,S. T. C.,"sacredness of private life, which not seldom merit legal rather than"
8264,S. T. C.,"literary chastisement, the two principal objects and occasions which I"
8265,S. T. C.,find for blame and regret in the conduct of the review in question are
8266,S. T. C.,"first, its unfaithfulness to its own announced and excellent plan, by"
8267,S. T. C.,"subjecting to criticism works neither indecent nor immoral, yet of such"
8268,S. T. C.,"trifling importance even in point of size and, according to the critic’s"
8269,S. T. C.,"own verdict, so devoid of all merit, as must excite in the most candid"
8270,S. T. C.,"mind the suspicion, either that dislike or vindictive feelings were at"
8271,S. T. C.,work; or that there was a cold prudential pre-determination to increase
8272,S. T. C.,the sale of the review by flattering the malignant passions of human
8273,S. T. C.,"nature. That I may not myself become subject to the charge, which I am"
8274,S. T. C.,"bringing against others, by an accusation without proof, I refer to"
8275,S. T. C.,the article on Dr. Rennell’s sermon in the very first number of the
8276,S. T. C.,EDINBURGH REVIEW as an illustration of my meaning. If in looking through
8277,S. T. C.,all the succeeding volumes the reader should find this a solitary
8278,S. T. C.,"instance, I must submit to that painful forfeiture of esteem, which"
8279,S. T. C.,awaits a groundless or exaggerated charge.
8280,S. T. C.,
8281,S. T. C.,The second point of objection belongs to this review only in common with
8282,S. T. C.,"all other works of periodical criticism: at least, it applies in common"
8283,S. T. C.,"to the general system of all, whatever exception there may be in favour"
8284,S. T. C.,"of particular articles. Or if it attaches to THE EDINBURGH REVIEW, and"
8285,S. T. C.,"to its only corrival (THE QUARTERLY), with any peculiar force, this"
8286,S. T. C.,"results from the superiority of talent, acquirement, and information"
8287,S. T. C.,which both have so undeniably displayed; and which doubtless deepens
8288,S. T. C.,the regret though not the blame. I am referring to the substitution
8289,S. T. C.,of assertion for argument; to the frequency of arbitrary and sometimes
8290,S. T. C.,"petulant verdicts, not seldom unsupported even by a single quotation"
8291,S. T. C.,"from the work condemned, which might at least have explained the"
8292,S. T. C.,"critic’s meaning, if it did not prove the justice of his sentence. Even"
8293,S. T. C.,"where this is not the case, the extracts are too often made without"
8294,S. T. C.,reference to any general grounds or rules from which the faultiness or
8295,S. T. C.,inadmissibility of the qualities attributed may be deduced; and without
8296,S. T. C.,"any attempt to show, that the qualities are attributable to the passage"
8297,S. T. C.,"extracted. I have met with such extracts from Mr. Wordsworth’s poems,"
8298,S. T. C.,"annexed to such assertions, as led me to imagine, that the reviewer,"
8299,S. T. C.,"having written his critique before he had read the work, had then"
8300,S. T. C.,"pricked with a pin for passages, wherewith to illustrate the various"
8301,S. T. C.,branches of his preconceived opinions. By what principle of rational
8302,S. T. C.,choice can we suppose a critic to have been directed (at least in a
8303,S. T. C.,"Christian country, and himself, we hope, a Christian) who gives the"
8304,S. T. C.,"following lines, portraying the fervour of solitary devotion excited by"
8305,S. T. C.,"the magnificent display of the Almighty’s works, as a proof and"
8306,S. T. C.,"example of an author’s tendency to downright ravings, and absolute"
8307,S. T. C.,unintelligibility?
8308,S. T. C.,
8309,S. T. C.,"“O then what soul was his, when on the tops"
8310,S. T. C.,Of the high mountains he beheld the sun
8311,S. T. C.,"Rise up, and bathe the world in light! He looked--"
8312,S. T. C.,"Ocean and earth, the solid frame of earth,"
8313,S. T. C.,"And ocean’s liquid mass, beneath him lay"
8314,S. T. C.,"In gladness and deep joy. The clouds were touched,"
8315,S. T. C.,And in their silent faces did he read
8316,S. T. C.,"Unutterable love. Sound needed none,"
8317,S. T. C.,Nor any voice of joy: his spirit drank
8318,S. T. C.,"The spectacle! sensation, soul, and form,"
8319,S. T. C.,All melted into him; they swallowed up
8320,S. T. C.,"His animal being; in them did he live,"
8321,S. T. C.,And by them did he live: they were his life.”
8322,S. T. C.,
8323,S. T. C.,"Can it be expected, that either the author or his admirers, should be"
8324,S. T. C.,induced to pay any serious attention to decisions which prove nothing
8325,S. T. C.,but the pitiable state of the critic’s own taste and sensibility? On
8326,S. T. C.,"opening the review they see a favourite passage, of the force and truth"
8327,S. T. C.,of which they had an intuitive certainty in their own inward experience
8328,S. T. C.,"confirmed, if confirmation it could receive, by the sympathy of their"
8329,S. T. C.,"most enlightened friends; some of whom perhaps, even in the world’s"
8330,S. T. C.,"opinion, hold a higher intellectual rank than the critic himself would"
8331,S. T. C.,"presume to claim. And this very passage they find selected, as the"
8332,S. T. C.,characteristic effusion of a mind deserted by reason!--as furnishing
8333,S. T. C.,"evidence that the writer was raving, or he could not have thus strung"
8334,S. T. C.,words together without sense or purpose! No diversity of taste seems
8335,S. T. C.,capable of explaining such a contrast in judgment.
8336,S. T. C.,
8337,S. T. C.,"That I had over-rated the merit of a passage or poem, that I had erred"
8338,S. T. C.,"concerning the degree of its excellence, I might be easily induced to"
8339,S. T. C.,"believe or apprehend. But that lines, the sense of which I had analysed"
8340,S. T. C.,and found consonant with all the best convictions of my understanding;
8341,S. T. C.,and the imagery and diction of which had collected round those
8342,S. T. C.,convictions my noblest as well as my most delightful feelings; that I
8343,S. T. C.,"should admit such lines to be mere nonsense or lunacy, is too much for"
8344,S. T. C.,the most ingenious arguments to effect. But that such a revolution of
8345,S. T. C.,"taste should be brought about by a few broad assertions, seems little"
8346,S. T. C.,"less than impossible. On the contrary, it would require an effort of"
8347,S. T. C.,"charity not to dismiss the criticism with the aphorism of the wise man,"
8348,S. T. C.,in animam malevolam sapientia haud intrare potest.
8349,S. T. C.,
8350,S. T. C.,What then if this very critic should have cited a large number of single
8351,S. T. C.,"lines and even of long paragraphs, which he himself acknowledges to"
8352,S. T. C.,"possess eminent and original beauty? What if he himself has owned, that"
8353,S. T. C.,beauties as great are scattered in abundance throughout the whole
8354,S. T. C.,"book? And yet, though under this impression, should have commenced his"
8355,S. T. C.,critique in vulgar exultation with a prophecy meant to secure its own
8356,S. T. C.,fulfilment? With a “This won’t do!” What? if after such acknowledgments
8357,S. T. C.,extorted from his own judgment he should proceed from charge to charge
8358,S. T. C.,"of tameness and raving; flights and flatness; and at length, consigning"
8359,S. T. C.,"the author to the house of incurables, should conclude with a strain of"
8360,S. T. C.,rudest contempt evidently grounded in the distempered state of his own
8361,S. T. C.,moral associations? Suppose too all this done without a single leading
8362,S. T. C.,"principle established or even announced, and without any one attempt at"
8363,S. T. C.,"argumentative deduction, though the poet had presented a more than usual"
8364,S. T. C.,"opportunity for it, by having previously made public his own principles"
8365,S. T. C.,"of judgment in poetry, and supported them by a connected train of"
8366,S. T. C.,reasoning!
8367,S. T. C.,

8372,S. T. C.,
8373,S. T. C.,"The reverse, for in all cases a reverse is possible, is the appropriate"
8374,S. T. C.,"business of burlesque and travesty, a predominant taste for which has"
8375,S. T. C.,been always deemed a mark of a low and degraded mind. When I was at
8376,S. T. C.,"Rome, among many other visits to the tomb of Julius II. I went thither"
8377,S. T. C.,"once with a Prussian artist, a man of genius and great vivacity of"
8378,S. T. C.,"feeling. As we were gazing on Michael Angelo’s MOSES, our conversation"
8379,S. T. C.,turned on the horns and beard of that stupendous statue; of the
8380,S. T. C.,necessity of each to support the other; of the super-human effect of the
8381,S. T. C.,"former, and the necessity of the existence of both to give a harmony and"
8382,S. T. C.,integrity both to the image and the feeling excited by it. Conceive
8383,S. T. C.,"them removed, and the statue would become un-natural, without being"
8384,S. T. C.,"super-natural. We called to mind the horns of the rising sun, and I"
8385,S. T. C.,repeated the noble passage from Taylor’s HOLY DYING. That horns were the
8386,S. T. C.,"emblem of power and sovereignty among the Eastern nations, and are still"
8387,S. T. C.,retained as such in Abyssinia; the Achelous of the ancient Greeks; and
8388,S. T. C.,"the probable ideas and feelings, that originally suggested the mixture"
8389,S. T. C.,"of the human and the brute form in the figure, by which they realized"
8390,S. T. C.,"the idea of their mysterious Pan, as representing intelligence blended"
8391,S. T. C.,"with a darker power, deeper, mightier, and more universal than the"
8392,S. T. C.,conscious intellect of man; than intelligence;--all these thoughts and
8393,S. T. C.,recollections passed in procession before our minds. My companion who
8394,S. T. C.,"possessed more than his share of the hatred, which his countrymen bore"
8395,S. T. C.,"to the French, had just observed to me, “a Frenchman, Sir! is the only"
8396,S. T. C.,"animal in the human shape, that by no possibility can lift itself up to"
8397,S. T. C.,"religion or poetry:” when, lo! two French officers of distinction and"
8398,S. T. C.,"rank entered the church! “Mark you,” whispered the Prussian, “the"
8399,S. T. C.,first thing which those scoundrels will notice--(for they will begin by
8400,S. T. C.,"instantly noticing the statue in parts, without one moment’s pause of"
8401,S. T. C.,admiration impressed by the whole)--will be the horns and the beard. And
8402,S. T. C.,"the associations, which they will immediately connect with them will be"
8403,S. T. C.,those of a he-goat and a cuckold.” Never did man guess more luckily. Had
8404,S. T. C.,"he inherited a portion of the great legislator’s prophetic powers, whose"
8405,S. T. C.,"statue we had been contemplating, he could scarcely have uttered words"
8406,S. T. C.,"more coincident with the result: for even as he had said, so it came to"
8407,S. T. C.,pass.
8408,S. T. C.,
8409,S. T. C.,"In THE EXCURSION the poet has introduced an old man, born in humble but"
8410,S. T. C.,"not abject circumstances, who had enjoyed more than usual advantages of"
8411,S. T. C.,"education, both from books and from the more awful discipline of nature."
8412,S. T. C.,"This person he represents, as having been driven by the restlessness of"
8413,S. T. C.,"fervid feelings, and from a craving intellect to an itinerant life; and"
8414,S. T. C.,"as having in consequence passed the larger portion of his time, from"
8415,S. T. C.,"earliest manhood, in villages and hamlets from door to door,"
8416,S. T. C.,
8417,S. T. C.,“A vagrant Merchant bent beneath his load.”
8418,S. T. C.,
8419,S. T. C.,"Now whether this be a character appropriate to a lofty didactick poem,"
8420,S. T. C.,is perhaps questionable. It presents a fair subject for controversy; and
8421,S. T. C.,the question is to be determined by the congruity or incongruity of such
8422,S. T. C.,a character with what shall be proved to be the essential constituents
8423,S. T. C.,"of poetry. But surely the critic who, passing by all the opportunities"
8424,S. T. C.,which such a mode of life would present to such a man; all the
8425,S. T. C.,"advantages of the liberty of nature, of solitude, and of solitary"
8426,S. T. C.,"thought; all the varieties of places and seasons, through which his"
8427,S. T. C.,"track had lain, with all the varying imagery they bring with them; and"
8428,S. T. C.,"lastly, all the observations of men,"
8429,S. T. C.,
8430,S. T. C.,"“Their manners, their enjoyments, and pursuits,"
8431,S. T. C.,Their passions and their feelings=”
8432,S. T. C.,
8433,S. T. C.,which the memory of these yearly journeys must have given and recalled
8434,S. T. C.,"to such a mind--the critic, I say, who from the multitude of possible"
8435,S. T. C.,associations should pass by all these in order to fix his attention
8436,S. T. C.,"exclusively on the pin-papers, and stay-tapes, which might have been"
8437,S. T. C.,"among the wares of his pack; this critic, in my opinion, cannot be"
8438,S. T. C.,thought to possess a much higher or much healthier state of moral
8439,S. T. C.,"feeling, than the Frenchmen above recorded."

8445,CHAPTER XXII,
8446,CHAPTER XXII,"The characteristic defects of Wordsworth’s poetry, with the principles"
8447,CHAPTER XXII,"from which the judgment, that they are defects, is deduced--Their"
8448,CHAPTER XXII,proportion to the beauties--For the greatest part characteristic of his
8449,CHAPTER XXII,theory only.
8450,CHAPTER XXII,
8451,CHAPTER XXII,
8452,CHAPTER XXII,If Mr. Wordsworth have set forth principles of poetry which his
8453,CHAPTER XXII,"arguments are insufficient to support, let him and those who have"
8454,CHAPTER XXII,adopted his sentiments be set right by the confutation of those
8455,CHAPTER XXII,"arguments, and by the substitution of more philosophical principles. And"
8456,CHAPTER XXII,still let the due credit be given to the portion and importance of the
8457,CHAPTER XXII,"truths, which are blended with his theory; truths, the too exclusive"
8458,CHAPTER XXII,"attention to which had occasioned its errors, by tempting him to carry"
8459,CHAPTER XXII,those truths beyond their proper limits. If his mistaken theory have at
8460,CHAPTER XXII,"all influenced his poetic compositions, let the effects be pointed"
8461,CHAPTER XXII,"out, and the instances given. But let it likewise be shown, how far the"
8462,CHAPTER XXII,"influence has acted; whether diffusively, or only by starts; whether the"
8463,CHAPTER XXII,number and importance of the poems and passages thus infected be great
8464,CHAPTER XXII,"or trifling compared with the sound portion; and lastly, whether they"
8465,CHAPTER XXII,"are inwoven into the texture of his works, or are loose and separable."
8466,CHAPTER XXII,"The result of such a trial would evince beyond a doubt, what it is high"
8467,CHAPTER XXII,"time to announce decisively and aloud, that the supposed characteristics"
8468,CHAPTER XXII,"of Mr. Wordsworth’s poetry, whether admired or reprobated; whether they"
8469,CHAPTER XXII,"are simplicity or simpleness; faithful adherence to essential nature, or"
8470,CHAPTER XXII,wilful selections from human nature of its meanest forms and under the
8471,CHAPTER XXII,least attractive associations; are as little the real characteristics of
8472,CHAPTER XXII,"his poetry at large, as of his genius and the constitution of his mind."
8473,CHAPTER XXII,
8474,CHAPTER XXII,In a comparatively small number of poems he chose to try an experiment;
8475,CHAPTER XXII,and this experiment we will suppose to have failed. Yet even in these
8476,CHAPTER XXII,poems it is impossible not to perceive that the natural tendency of
8477,CHAPTER XXII,the poet’s mind is to great objects and elevated conceptions. The
8478,CHAPTER XXII,"poem entitled FIDELITY is for the greater part written in language,"
8479,CHAPTER XXII,as unraised and naked as any perhaps in the two volumes. Yet take the
8480,CHAPTER XXII,following stanza and compare it with the preceding stanzas of the same
8481,CHAPTER XXII,poem.
8482,CHAPTER XXII,
8483,CHAPTER XXII,“There sometimes doth a leaping fish
8484,CHAPTER XXII,Send through the tarn a lonely cheer;
8485,CHAPTER XXII,"The crags repeat the raven’s croak,"
8486,CHAPTER XXII,In symphony austere;
8487,CHAPTER XXII,Thither the rainbow comes--the cloud--
8488,CHAPTER XXII,And mists that spread the flying shroud;
8489,CHAPTER XXII,"And sun-beams; and the sounding blast,"
8490,CHAPTER XXII,"That, if it could, would hurry past;"
8491,CHAPTER XXII,But that enormous barrier holds it fast.”
8492,CHAPTER XXII,
8493,CHAPTER XXII,Or compare the four last lines of the concluding stanza with the former
8494,CHAPTER XXII,half.
8495,CHAPTER XXII,
8496,CHAPTER XXII,"“Yes, proof was plain that, since the day"
8497,CHAPTER XXII,"On which the Traveller thus had died,"
8498,CHAPTER XXII,"The Dog had watched about the spot,"
8499,CHAPTER XXII,Or by his Master’s side:
8500,CHAPTER XXII,How nourish’d here through such long time
8501,CHAPTER XXII,"He knows, who gave that love sublime,--"
8502,CHAPTER XXII,"And gave that strength of feeling, great"
8503,CHAPTER XXII,Above all human estimate!”
8504,CHAPTER XXII,
8505,CHAPTER XXII,"Can any candid and intelligent mind hesitate in determining, which of"
8506,CHAPTER XXII,these best represents the tendency and native character of the poet’s
8507,CHAPTER XXII,genius? Will he not decide that the one was written because the poet
8508,CHAPTER XXII,"would so write, and the other because he could not so entirely repress"
8509,CHAPTER XXII,"the force and grandeur of his mind, but that he must in some part or"
8510,CHAPTER XXII,"other of every composition write otherwise? In short, that his only"
8511,CHAPTER XXII,"disease is the being out of his element; like the swan, that, having"
8512,CHAPTER XXII,"amused himself, for a while, with crushing the weeds on the river’s"
8513,CHAPTER XXII,"bank, soon returns to his own majestic movements on its reflecting and"
8514,CHAPTER XXII,sustaining surface. Let it be observed that I am here supposing the
8515,CHAPTER XXII,"imagined judge, to whom I appeal, to have already decided against the"
8516,CHAPTER XXII,"poet’s theory, as far as it is different from the principles of the art,"
8517,CHAPTER XXII,generally acknowledged.
8518,CHAPTER XXII,
8519,CHAPTER XXII,I cannot here enter into a detailed examination of Mr. Wordsworth’s
8520,CHAPTER XXII,"works; but I will attempt to give the main results of my own judgment,"
8521,CHAPTER XXII,"after an acquaintance of many years, and repeated perusals. And though,"
8522,CHAPTER XXII,to appreciate the defects of a great mind it is necessary to understand
8523,CHAPTER XXII,"previously its characteristic excellences, yet I have already expressed"
8524,CHAPTER XXII,"myself with sufficient fulness, to preclude most of the ill effects that"
8525,CHAPTER XXII,might arise from my pursuing a contrary arrangement. I will therefore
8526,CHAPTER XXII,commence with what I deem the prominent defects of his poems hitherto
8527,CHAPTER XXII,published.
8528,CHAPTER XXII,
8529,CHAPTER XXII,"The first characteristic, though only occasional defect, which I appear"
8530,CHAPTER XXII,to myself to find in these poems is the inconstancy of the style. Under
8531,CHAPTER XXII,this name I refer to the sudden and unprepared transitions from lines
8532,CHAPTER XXII,or sentences of peculiar felicity--(at all events striking and
8533,CHAPTER XXII,"original)--to a style, not only unimpassioned but undistinguished. He"
8534,CHAPTER XXII,"sinks too often and too abruptly to that style, which I should place"
8535,CHAPTER XXII,"in the second division of language, dividing it into the three species;"
8536,CHAPTER XXII,"first, that which is peculiar to poetry; second, that which is only"
8537,CHAPTER XXII,"proper in prose; and third, the neutral or common to both. There have"
8538,CHAPTER XXII,"been works, such as Cowley’s Essay on Cromwell, in which prose and verse"
8539,CHAPTER XXII,"are intermixed (not as in the Consolation of Boetius, or the ARGENIS"
8540,CHAPTER XXII,"of Barclay, by the insertion of poems supposed to have been spoken or"
8541,CHAPTER XXII,"composed on occasions previously related in prose, but) the poet passing"
8542,CHAPTER XXII,"from one to the other, as the nature of the thoughts or his own feelings"
8543,CHAPTER XXII,dictated. Yet this mode of composition does not satisfy a cultivated
8544,CHAPTER XXII,taste. There is something unpleasant in the being thus obliged to
8545,CHAPTER XXII,"alternate states of feeling so dissimilar, and this too in a species of"
8546,CHAPTER XXII,"writing, the pleasure from which is in part derived from the preparation"
8547,CHAPTER XXII,and previous expectation of the reader. A portion of that awkwardness
8548,CHAPTER XXII,is felt which hangs upon the introduction of songs in our modern comic
8549,CHAPTER XXII,operas; and to prevent which the judicious Metastasio (as to whose
8550,CHAPTER XXII,"exquisite taste there can be no hesitation, whatever doubts may be"
8551,CHAPTER XXII,entertained as to his poetic genius) uniformly placed the aria at the
8552,CHAPTER XXII,"end of the scene, at the same time that he almost always raises and"
8553,CHAPTER XXII,impassions the style of the recitative immediately preceding. Even in
8554,CHAPTER XXII,"real life, the difference is great and evident between words used as the"
8555,CHAPTER XXII,"arbitrary marks of thought, our smooth market-coin of intercourse,"
8556,CHAPTER XXII,with the image and superscription worn out by currency; and those which
8557,CHAPTER XXII,convey pictures either borrowed from one outward object to enliven and
8558,CHAPTER XXII,particularize some other; or used allegorically to body forth the inward
8559,CHAPTER XXII,state of the person speaking; or such as are at least the exponents of
8560,CHAPTER XXII,"his peculiar turn and unusual extent of faculty. So much so indeed, that"
8561,CHAPTER XXII,in the social circles of private life we often find a striking use of
8562,CHAPTER XXII,"the latter put a stop to the general flow of conversation, and by the"
8563,CHAPTER XXII,excitement arising from concentred attention produce a sort of damp
8564,CHAPTER XXII,and interruption for some minutes after. But in the perusal of works of
8565,CHAPTER XXII,"literary art, we prepare ourselves for such language; and the business"
8566,CHAPTER XXII,"of the writer, like that of a painter whose subject requires unusual"
8567,CHAPTER XXII,"splendour and prominence, is so to raise the lower and neutral tints,"
8568,CHAPTER XXII,"that what in a different style would be the commanding colours, are"
8569,CHAPTER XXII,here used as the means of that gentle degradation requisite in order to
8570,CHAPTER XXII,"produce the effect of a whole. Where this is not achieved in a poem,"
8571,CHAPTER XXII,the metre merely reminds the reader of his claims in order to disappoint
8572,CHAPTER XXII,"them; and where this defect occurs frequently, his feelings are"
8573,CHAPTER XXII,alternately startled by anticlimax and hyperclimax.
8574,CHAPTER XXII,
8575,CHAPTER XXII,I refer the reader to the exquisite stanzas cited for another purpose
8576,CHAPTER XXII,"from THE BLIND HIGHLAND BOY; and then annex, as being in my opinion"
8577,CHAPTER XXII,"instances of this disharmony in style, the two following:"
8578,CHAPTER XXII,
8579,CHAPTER XXII,"“And one, the rarest, was a shell,"
8580,CHAPTER XXII,"Which he, poor child, had studied well:"
8581,CHAPTER XXII,"The shell of a green turtle, thin"
8582,CHAPTER XXII,"And hollow;--you might sit therein,"
8583,CHAPTER XXII,"It was so wide, and deep.”"
8584,CHAPTER XXII,
8585,CHAPTER XXII,“Our Highland Boy oft visited
8586,CHAPTER XXII,"The house which held this prize; and, led"
8587,CHAPTER XXII,"By choice or chance, did thither come"
8588,CHAPTER XXII,"One day, when no one was at home,"
8589,CHAPTER XXII,And found the door unbarred.”
8590,CHAPTER XXII,
8591,CHAPTER XXII,"Or page 172, vol. I."
8592,CHAPTER XXII,
8593,CHAPTER XXII,"“’Tis gone forgotten, let me do"
8594,CHAPTER XXII,My best. There was a smile or two--
8595,CHAPTER XXII,"I can remember them, I see"
8596,CHAPTER XXII,The smiles worth all the world to me.
8597,CHAPTER XXII,Dear Baby! I must lay thee down:
8598,CHAPTER XXII,Thou troublest me with strange alarms;
8599,CHAPTER XXII,"Smiles hast thou, sweet ones of thine own;"
8600,CHAPTER XXII,I cannot keep thee in my arms;
8601,CHAPTER XXII,"For they confound me: as it is,"
8602,CHAPTER XXII,I have forgot those smiles of his!”
8603,CHAPTER XXII,
8604,CHAPTER XXII,"Or page 269, vol. I."
8605,CHAPTER XXII,
8606,CHAPTER XXII,"“Thou hast a nest, for thy love and thy rest"
8607,CHAPTER XXII,And though little troubled with sloth
8608,CHAPTER XXII,Drunken lark! thou would’st be loth
8609,CHAPTER XXII,To be such a traveller as I.
8610,CHAPTER XXII,"Happy, happy liver!"
8611,CHAPTER XXII,_With a soul as strong as a mountain river
8612,CHAPTER XXII,"Pouring out praise to th’ Almighty giver,_"
8613,CHAPTER XXII,Joy and jollity be with us both!
8614,CHAPTER XXII,"Hearing thee or else some other,"
8615,CHAPTER XXII,As merry a brother
8616,CHAPTER XXII,I on the earth will go plodding on
8617,CHAPTER XXII,By myself cheerfully till the day is done.”
8618,CHAPTER XXII,
8619,CHAPTER XXII,"The incongruity, which I appear to find in this passage, is that of the"
8620,CHAPTER XXII,two noble lines in italics with the preceding and following. So vol. II.
8621,CHAPTER XXII,page 30.
8622,CHAPTER XXII,
8623,CHAPTER XXII,"“Close by a Pond, upon the further side,"
8624,CHAPTER XXII,"He stood alone; a minute’s space I guess,"
8625,CHAPTER XXII,"I watch’d him, he continuing motionless"
8626,CHAPTER XXII,To the Pool’s further margin then I drew;
8627,CHAPTER XXII,He being all the while before me full in view.”
8628,CHAPTER XXII,
8629,CHAPTER XXII,"Compare this with the repetition of the same image, the next stanza but"
8630,CHAPTER XXII,two.
8631,CHAPTER XXII,
8632,CHAPTER XXII,"“And, still as I drew near with gentle pace,"
8633,CHAPTER XXII,Beside the little pond or moorish flood
8634,CHAPTER XXII,"Motionless as a Cloud the Old Man stood,"
8635,CHAPTER XXII,That heareth not the loud winds when they call;
8636,CHAPTER XXII,"And moveth altogether, if it move at all.”"
8637,CHAPTER XXII,
8638,CHAPTER XXII,"Or lastly, the second of the three following stanzas, compared both with"
8639,CHAPTER XXII,the first and the third.
8640,CHAPTER XXII,
8641,CHAPTER XXII,“My former thoughts returned; the fear that kills;
8642,CHAPTER XXII,And hope that is unwilling to be fed;
8643,CHAPTER XXII,"Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills;"
8644,CHAPTER XXII,And mighty Poets in their misery dead.
8645,CHAPTER XXII,"But now, perplex’d by what the Old Man had said,"
8646,CHAPTER XXII,"My question eagerly did I renew,"
8647,CHAPTER XXII,"‘How is it that you live, and what is it you do?’"
8648,CHAPTER XXII,
8649,CHAPTER XXII,“He with a smile did then his words repeat;
8650,CHAPTER XXII,"And said, that gathering Leeches far and wide"
8651,CHAPTER XXII,He travell’d; stirring thus about his feet
8652,CHAPTER XXII,The waters of the Ponds where they abide.
8653,CHAPTER XXII,`Once I could meet with them on every side;
8654,CHAPTER XXII,‘But they have dwindled long by slow decay;
8655,CHAPTER XXII,"‘Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may.’"
8656,CHAPTER XXII,
8657,CHAPTER XXII,"While he was talking thus, the lonely place,"
8658,CHAPTER XXII,"The Old Man’s shape, and speech, all troubled me"
8659,CHAPTER XXII,In my mind’s eye I seemed to see him pace
8660,CHAPTER XXII,"About the weary moors continually,"
8661,CHAPTER XXII,Wandering about alone and silently.”
8662,CHAPTER XXII,
8663,CHAPTER XXII,Indeed this fine poem is especially characteristic of the author. There
8664,CHAPTER XXII,is scarce a defect or excellence in his writings of which it would
8665,CHAPTER XXII,not present a specimen. But it would be unjust not to repeat that this
8666,CHAPTER XXII,defect is only occasional. From a careful reperusal of the two volumes
8667,CHAPTER XXII,"of poems, I doubt whether the objectionable passages would amount in the"
8668,CHAPTER XXII,whole to one hundred lines; not the eighth part of the number of pages.
8669,CHAPTER XXII,In THE EXCURSION the feeling of incongruity is seldom excited by
8670,CHAPTER XXII,"the diction of any passage considered in itself, but by the sudden"
8671,CHAPTER XXII,superiority of some other passage forming the context.
8672,CHAPTER XXII,
8673,CHAPTER XXII,"The second defect I can generalize with tolerable accuracy, if the"
8674,CHAPTER XXII,"reader will pardon an uncouth and new-coined word. There is, I should"
8675,CHAPTER XXII,"say, not seldom a matter-of-factness in certain poems. This may"
8676,CHAPTER XXII,"be divided into, first, a laborious minuteness and fidelity in the"
8677,CHAPTER XXII,"representation of objects, and their positions, as they appeared to the"
8678,CHAPTER XXII,"poet himself; secondly, the insertion of accidental circumstances,"
8679,CHAPTER XXII,"in order to the full explanation of his living characters, their"
8680,CHAPTER XXII,dispositions and actions; which circumstances might be necessary to
8681,CHAPTER XXII,"establish the probability of a statement in real life, where nothing is"
8682,CHAPTER XXII,"taken for granted by the hearer; but appear superfluous in poetry, where"
8683,CHAPTER XXII,the reader is willing to believe for his own sake. To this actidentality
8684,CHAPTER XXII,"I object, as contravening the essence of poetry, which Aristotle"
8685,CHAPTER XXII,"pronounces to be spoudaiotaton kai philosophotaton genos, the most"
8686,CHAPTER XXII,"intense, weighty and philosophical product of human art; adding, as the"
8687,CHAPTER XXII,"reason, that it is the most catholic and abstract. The following passage"
8688,CHAPTER XXII,from Davenant’s prefatory letter to Hobbes well expresses this truth.
8689,CHAPTER XXII,“When I considered the actions which I meant to describe; (those
8690,CHAPTER XXII,"inferring the persons), I was again persuaded rather to choose those"
8691,CHAPTER XXII,"of a former age, than the present; and in a century so far removed, as"
8692,CHAPTER XXII,"might preserve me from their improper examinations, who know not the"
8693,CHAPTER XXII,"requisites of a poem, nor how much pleasure they lose, (and even the"
8694,CHAPTER XXII,"pleasures of heroic poesy are not unprofitable), who take away the"
8695,CHAPTER XXII,"liberty of a poet, and fetter his feet in the shackles of an historian."
8696,CHAPTER XXII,For why should a poet doubt in story to mend the intrigues of fortune
8697,CHAPTER XXII,"by more delightful conveyances of probable fictions, because austere"
8698,CHAPTER XXII,"historians have entered into bond to truth? An obligation, which were"
8699,CHAPTER XXII,"in poets as foolish and unnecessary, as is the bondage of false martyrs,"
8700,CHAPTER XXII,"who lie in chains for a mistaken opinion. But by this I would imply,"
8701,CHAPTER XXII,"that truth, narrative and past, is the idol of historians, (who worship"
8702,CHAPTER XXII,"a dead thing), and truth operative, and by effects continually alive,"
8703,CHAPTER XXII,"is the mistress of poets, who hath not her existence in matter, but in"
8704,CHAPTER XXII,reason.”
8705,CHAPTER XXII,
8706,CHAPTER XXII,"For this minute accuracy in the painting of local imagery, the lines in"
8707,CHAPTER XXII,"THE EXCURSION, pp. 96, 97, and 98, may be taken, if not as a striking"
8708,CHAPTER XXII,"instance, yet as an illustration of my meaning. It must be some strong"
8709,CHAPTER XXII,"motive--(as, for instance, that the description was necessary to the"
8710,CHAPTER XXII,intelligibility of the tale)--which could induce me to describe in
8711,CHAPTER XXII,a number of verses what a draughtsman could present to the eye with
8712,CHAPTER XXII,"incomparably greater satisfaction by half a dozen strokes of his pencil,"
8713,CHAPTER XXII,or the painter with as many touches of his brush. Such descriptions too
8714,CHAPTER XXII,"often occasion in the mind of a reader, who is determined to understand"
8715,CHAPTER XXII,"his author, a feeling of labour, not very dissimilar to that, with"
8716,CHAPTER XXII,"which he would construct a diagram, line by line, for a long geometrical"
8717,CHAPTER XXII,proposition. It seems to be like taking the pieces of a dissected map
8718,CHAPTER XXII,"out of its box. We first look at one part, and then at another, then"
8719,CHAPTER XXII,join and dove-tail them; and when the successive acts of attention have
8720,CHAPTER XXII,"been completed, there is a retrogressive effort of mind to behold it as"
8721,CHAPTER XXII,"a whole. The poet should paint to the imagination, not to the fancy; and"
8722,CHAPTER XXII,I know no happier case to exemplify the distinction between these two
8723,CHAPTER XXII,faculties. Master-pieces of the former mode of poetic painting abound
8724,CHAPTER XXII,"in the writings of Milton, for example:"
8725,CHAPTER XXII,
8726,CHAPTER XXII,"“The fig-tree; not that kind for fruit renown’d,"
8727,CHAPTER XXII,"“But such as at this day, to Indians known,"
8728,CHAPTER XXII,“In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms
8729,CHAPTER XXII,"“Branching so broad and long, that in the ground"
8730,CHAPTER XXII,"“The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow"
8731,CHAPTER XXII,"“About the mother tree, a pillar’d shade"
8732,CHAPTER XXII,“High over-arch’d and ECHOING WALKS BETWEEN;
8733,CHAPTER XXII,"“There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat,"
8734,CHAPTER XXII,"“Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds"
8735,CHAPTER XXII,“At hoop-holes cut through thickest shade.”
8736,CHAPTER XXII,
8737,CHAPTER XXII,"This is creation rather than painting, or if painting, yet such, and"
8738,CHAPTER XXII,with such co-presence of the whole picture flashed at once upon the
8739,CHAPTER XXII,"eye, as the sun paints in a camera obscura. But the poet must likewise"
8740,CHAPTER XXII,understand and command what Bacon calls the vestigia communia of the
8741,CHAPTER XXII,"senses, the latency of all in each, and more especially as by a magical"
8742,CHAPTER XXII,"penny duplex, the excitement of vision by sound and the exponents of"
8743,CHAPTER XXII,"sound. Thus, “The echoing walks between,” may be almost said to reverse"
8744,CHAPTER XXII,"the fable in tradition of the head of Memnon, in the Egyptian statue."
8745,CHAPTER XXII,Such may be deservedly entitled the creative words in the world of
8746,CHAPTER XXII,imagination.
8747,CHAPTER XXII,
8748,CHAPTER XXII,The second division respects an apparent minute adherence to
8749,CHAPTER XXII,matter-of-fact in character and Incidents; a biographical attention to
8750,CHAPTER XXII,"probability, and an anxiety of explanation and retrospect. Under this"
8751,CHAPTER XXII,"head I shall deliver, with no feigned diffidence, the results of my"
8752,CHAPTER XXII,best reflection on the great point of controversy between Mr.
8753,CHAPTER XXII,"Wordsworth and his objectors; namely, on the choice of his characters."
8754,CHAPTER XXII,"I have already declared, and, I trust justified, my utter dissent from"
8755,CHAPTER XXII,the mode of argument which his critics have hitherto employed. To their
8756,CHAPTER XXII,"question, “Why did you choose such a character, or a character from"
8757,CHAPTER XXII,such a rank of life?”--the poet might in my opinion fairly retort: why
8758,CHAPTER XXII,with the conception of my character did you make wilful choice of mean
8759,CHAPTER XXII,"or ludicrous associations not furnished by me, but supplied from your"
8760,CHAPTER XXII,"own sickly and fastidious feelings? How was it, indeed, probable, that"
8761,CHAPTER XXII,"such arguments could have any weight with an author, whose plan, whose"
8762,CHAPTER XXII,"guiding principle, and main object it was to attack and subdue that"
8763,CHAPTER XXII,"state of association, which leads us to place the chief value on those"
8764,CHAPTER XXII,"things on which man differs from man, and to forget or disregard the"
8765,CHAPTER XXII,"high dignities, which belong to Human Nature, the sense and the"
8766,CHAPTER XXII,"feeling, which may be, and ought to be, found in all ranks? The"
8767,CHAPTER XXII,"feelings with which, as Christians, we contemplate a mixed congregation"
8768,CHAPTER XXII,"rising or kneeling before their common Maker, Mr. Wordsworth would have"
8769,CHAPTER XXII,"us entertain at all times, as men, and as readers; and by the"
8770,CHAPTER XXII,"excitement of this lofty, yet prideless impartiality in poetry, he"
8771,CHAPTER XXII,might hope to have encouraged its continuance in real life. The praise
8772,CHAPTER XXII,"of good men be his! In real life, and, I trust, even in my imagination,"
8773,CHAPTER XXII,"I honour a virtuous and wise man, without reference to the presence or"
8774,CHAPTER XXII,absence of artificial advantages. Whether in the person of an armed
8775,CHAPTER XXII,"baron, a laurelled bard, or of an old Pedlar, or still older"
8776,CHAPTER XXII,"Leech-gatherer, the same qualities of head and heart must claim the"
8777,CHAPTER XXII,"same reverence. And even in poetry I am not conscious, that I have ever"
8778,CHAPTER XXII,suffered my feelings to be disturbed or offended by any thoughts or
8779,CHAPTER XXII,"images, which the poet himself has not presented."
8780,CHAPTER XXII,
8781,CHAPTER XXII,"But yet I object, nevertheless, and for the following reasons. First,"
8782,CHAPTER XXII,"because the object in view, as an immediate object, belongs to the moral"
8783,CHAPTER XXII,"philosopher, and would be pursued, not only more appropriately, but in"
8784,CHAPTER XXII,"my opinion with far greater probability of success, in sermons or moral"
8785,CHAPTER XXII,"essays, than in an elevated poem. It seems, indeed, to destroy the main"
8786,CHAPTER XXII,"fundamental distinction, not only between a poem and prose, but even"
8787,CHAPTER XXII,"between philosophy and works of fiction, inasmuch as it proposes truth"
8788,CHAPTER XXII,"for its immediate object, instead of pleasure. Now till the blessed time"
8789,CHAPTER XXII,"shall come, when truth itself shall be pleasure, and both shall be so"
8790,CHAPTER XXII,"united, as to be distinguishable in words only, not in feeling, it will"
8791,CHAPTER XXII,"remain the poet’s office to proceed upon that state of association,"
8792,CHAPTER XXII,which actually exists as general; instead of attempting first to make
8793,CHAPTER XXII,"it what it ought to be, and then to let the pleasure follow. But here"
8794,CHAPTER XXII,is unfortunately a small hysteron-proteron. For the communication of
8795,CHAPTER XXII,pleasure is the introductory means by which alone the poet must expect
8796,CHAPTER XXII,"to moralize his readers. Secondly: though I were to admit, for a moment,"
8797,CHAPTER XXII,this argument to be groundless: yet how is the moral effect to be
8798,CHAPTER XXII,"produced, by merely attaching the name of some low profession to powers"
8799,CHAPTER XXII,"which are least likely, and to qualities which are assuredly not more"
8800,CHAPTER XXII,"likely, to be found in it? The Poet, speaking in his own person, may"
8801,CHAPTER XXII,"at once delight and improve us by sentiments, which teach us the"
8802,CHAPTER XXII,"independence of goodness, of wisdom, and even of genius, on the favours"
8803,CHAPTER XXII,of fortune. And having made a due reverence before the throne of
8804,CHAPTER XXII,"Antonine, he may bow with equal awe before Epictetus among his"
8805,CHAPTER XXII,fellow-slaves
8806,CHAPTER XXII,
8807,CHAPTER XXII,------“and rejoice
8808,CHAPTER XXII,In the plain presence of his dignity.”
8809,CHAPTER XXII,
8810,CHAPTER XXII,"Who is not at once delighted and improved, when the Poet Wordsworth"
8811,CHAPTER XXII,"himself exclaims,"
8812,CHAPTER XXII,
8813,CHAPTER XXII,“Oh! many are the Poets that are sown
8814,CHAPTER XXII,By Nature; men endowed with highest gifts
8815,CHAPTER XXII,"The vision and the faculty divine,"
8816,CHAPTER XXII,"Yet wanting the accomplishment of verse,"
8817,CHAPTER XXII,"Nor having e’er, as life advanced, been led"
8818,CHAPTER XXII,By circumstance to take unto the height
8819,CHAPTER XXII,"The measure of themselves, these favoured Beings,"
8820,CHAPTER XXII,"All but a scattered few, live out their time,"
8821,CHAPTER XXII,"Husbanding that which they possess within,"
8822,CHAPTER XXII,"And go to the grave, unthought of. Strongest minds"
8823,CHAPTER XXII,Are often those of whom the noisy world
8824,CHAPTER XXII,Hears least.”
8825,CHAPTER XXII,
8826,CHAPTER XXII,"To use a colloquial phrase, such sentiments, in such language, do one’s"
8827,CHAPTER XXII,"heart good; though I for my part, have not the fullest faith in the"
8828,CHAPTER XXII,truth of the observation. On the contrary I believe the instances to
8829,CHAPTER XXII,be exceedingly rare; and should feel almost as strong an objection to
8830,CHAPTER XXII,"introduce such a character in a poetic fiction, as a pair of black swans"
8831,CHAPTER XXII,"on a lake, in a fancy landscape. When I think how many, and how much"
8832,CHAPTER XXII,"better books than Homer, or even than Herodotus, Pindar or Aeschylus,"
8833,CHAPTER XXII,"could have read, are in the power of almost every man, in a country"
8834,CHAPTER XXII,where almost every man is instructed to read and write; and how
8835,CHAPTER XXII,"restless, how difficultly hidden, the powers of genius are; and yet find"
8836,CHAPTER XXII,"even in situations the most favourable, according to Mr. Wordsworth, for"
8837,CHAPTER XXII,the formation of a pure and poetic language; in situations which ensure
8838,CHAPTER XXII,"familiarity with the grandest objects of the imagination; but one Burns,"
8839,CHAPTER XXII,"among the shepherds of Scotland, and not a single poet of humble life"
8840,CHAPTER XXII,"among those of English lakes and mountains; I conclude, that Poetic"
8841,CHAPTER XXII,Genius is not only a very delicate but a very rare plant.
8842,CHAPTER XXII,
8843,CHAPTER XXII,"But be this as it may, the feelings with which,"
8844,CHAPTER XXII,
8845,CHAPTER XXII,"“I think of Chatterton, the marvellous Boy,"
8846,CHAPTER XXII,"The sleepless Soul, that perished in his pride;"
8847,CHAPTER XXII,"Of Burns, who walk’d in glory and in joy"
8848,CHAPTER XXII,"Behind his plough, upon the mountain-side”--"
8849,CHAPTER XXII,
8850,CHAPTER XXII,"are widely different from those with which I should read a poem,"
8851,CHAPTER XXII,"where the author, having occasion for the character of a poet and a"
8852,CHAPTER XXII,"philosopher in the fable of his narration, had chosen to make him a"
8853,CHAPTER XXII,"chimney-sweeper; and then, in order to remove all doubts on the subject,"
8854,CHAPTER XXII,"had invented an account of his birth, parentage and education, with all"
8855,CHAPTER XXII,the strange and fortunate accidents which had concurred in making him at
8856,CHAPTER XXII,"once poet, philosopher, and sweep! Nothing, but biography, can justify"
8857,CHAPTER XXII,"this. If it be admissible even in a novel, it must be one in the manner"
8858,CHAPTER XXII,"of De Foe’s, that were meant to pass for histories, not in the manner of"
8859,CHAPTER XXII,"Fielding’s: In THE LIFE OF MOLL FLANDERS, Or COLONEL JACK, not in a TOM"
8860,CHAPTER XXII,"JONES, or even a JOSEPH ANDREWS. Much less then can it be legitimately"
8861,CHAPTER XXII,"introduced in a poem, the characters of which, amid the strongest"
8862,CHAPTER XXII,"individualization, must still remain representative. The precepts of"
8863,CHAPTER XXII,"Horace, on this point, are grounded on the nature both of poetry and of"
8864,CHAPTER XXII,"the human mind. They are not more peremptory, than wise and prudent."
8865,CHAPTER XXII,For in the first place a deviation from them perplexes the reader’s
8866,CHAPTER XXII,"feelings, and all the circumstances which are feigned in order to make"
8867,CHAPTER XXII,"such accidents less improbable, divide and disquiet his faith, rather"
8868,CHAPTER XXII,"than aid and support it. Spite of all attempts, the fiction will appear,"
8869,CHAPTER XXII,and unfortunately not as fictitious but as false. The reader not only
8870,CHAPTER XXII,"knows, that the sentiments and language are the poet’s own, and his"
8871,CHAPTER XXII,"own too in his artificial character, as poet; but by the fruitless"
8872,CHAPTER XXII,"endeavours to make him think the contrary, he is not even suffered to"
8873,CHAPTER XXII,"forget it. The effect is similar to that produced by an Epic Poet, when"
8874,CHAPTER XXII,"the fable and the characters are derived from Scripture history, as in"
8875,CHAPTER XXII,"THE MESSIAH of Klopstock, or in CUMBERLAND’S CALVARY; and not merely"
8876,CHAPTER XXII,"suggested by it as in the PARADISE LOST of Milton. That illusion,"
8877,CHAPTER XXII,"contradistinguished from delusion, that negative faith, which simply"
8878,CHAPTER XXII,"permits the images presented to work by their own force, without either"
8879,CHAPTER XXII,"denial or affirmation of their real existence by the judgment, is"
8880,CHAPTER XXII,rendered impossible by their immediate neighbourhood to words and facts
8881,CHAPTER XXII,"of known and absolute truth. A faith, which transcends even historic"
8882,CHAPTER XXII,"belief, must absolutely put out this mere poetic analogon of faith, as"
8883,CHAPTER XXII,"the summer sun is said to extinguish our household fires, when it shines"
8884,CHAPTER XXII,full upon them. What would otherwise have been yielded to as pleasing
8885,CHAPTER XXII,"fiction, is repelled as revolting falsehood. The effect produced in"
8886,CHAPTER XXII,"this latter case by the solemn belief of the reader, is in a less degree"
8887,CHAPTER XXII,"brought about in the instances, to which I have been objecting, by the"
8888,CHAPTER XXII,balked attempts of the author to make him believe.
8889,CHAPTER XXII,
8890,CHAPTER XXII,Add to all the foregoing the seeming uselessness both of the project and
8891,CHAPTER XXII,"of the anecdotes from which it is to derive support. Is there one word,"
8892,CHAPTER XXII,"for instance, attributed to the pedlar in THE EXCURSION, characteristic"
8893,CHAPTER XXII,"of a Pedlar? One sentiment, that might not more plausibly, even without"
8894,CHAPTER XXII,"the aid of any previous explanation, have proceeded from any wise and"
8895,CHAPTER XXII,"beneficent old man, of a rank or profession in which the language of"
8896,CHAPTER XXII,learning and refinement are natural and to be expected? Need the
8897,CHAPTER XXII,"rank have been at all particularized, where nothing follows which the"
8898,CHAPTER XXII,knowledge of that rank is to explain or illustrate? When on the contrary
8899,CHAPTER XXII,"this information renders the man’s language, feelings, sentiments,"
8900,CHAPTER XXII,"and information a riddle, which must itself be solved by episodes"
8901,CHAPTER XXII,"of anecdote? Finally when this, and this alone, could have induced a"
8902,CHAPTER XXII,"genuine Poet to inweave in a poem of the loftiest style, and on subjects"
8903,CHAPTER XXII,"the loftiest and of most universal interest, such minute matters of"
8904,CHAPTER XXII,"fact, (not unlike those furnished for the obituary of a magazine by the"
8905,CHAPTER XXII,friends of some obscure “ornament of society lately deceased” in some
8906,CHAPTER XXII,"obscure town,) as"
8907,CHAPTER XXII,
8908,CHAPTER XXII,“Among the hills of Athol he was born
8909,CHAPTER XXII,"There, on a small hereditary Farm,"
8910,CHAPTER XXII,"An unproductive slip of rugged ground,"
8911,CHAPTER XXII,His Father dwelt; and died in poverty;
8912,CHAPTER XXII,"While He, whose lowly fortune I retrace,"
8913,CHAPTER XXII,"The youngest of three sons, was yet a babe,"
8914,CHAPTER XXII,A little One--unconscious of their loss.
8915,CHAPTER XXII,But ere he had outgrown his infant days
8916,CHAPTER XXII,"His widowed Mother, for a second Mate,"
8917,CHAPTER XXII,Espoused the teacher of the Village School;
8918,CHAPTER XXII,Who on her offspring zealously bestowed
8919,CHAPTER XXII,Needful instruction.”
8920,CHAPTER XXII,
8921,CHAPTER XXII,"“From his sixth year, the Boy of whom I speak,"
8922,CHAPTER XXII,In summer tended cattle on the Hills;
8923,CHAPTER XXII,"But, through the inclement and the perilous days"
8924,CHAPTER XXII,"Of long-continuing winter, he repaired"

8926,CHAPTER XXII,
8927,CHAPTER XXII,"For all the admirable passages interposed in this narration, might, with"
8928,CHAPTER XXII,"trifling alterations, have been far more appropriately, and with far"
8929,CHAPTER XXII,"greater verisimilitude, told of a poet in the character of a poet;"
8930,CHAPTER XXII,"and without incurring another defect which I shall now mention, and a"
8931,CHAPTER XXII,sufficient illustration of which will have been here anticipated.
8932,CHAPTER XXII,
8933,CHAPTER XXII,"Third; an undue predilection for the dramatic form in certain poems,"
8934,CHAPTER XXII,from which one or other of two evils result. Either the thoughts and
8935,CHAPTER XXII,"diction are different from that of the poet, and then there arises an"
8936,CHAPTER XXII,"incongruity of style; or they are the same and indistinguishable, and"
8937,CHAPTER XXII,"then it presents a species of ventriloquism, where two are represented"
8938,CHAPTER XXII,"as talking, while in truth one man only speaks."
8939,CHAPTER XXII,
8940,CHAPTER XXII,The fourth class of defects is closely connected with the former;
8941,CHAPTER XXII,but yet are such as arise likewise from an intensity of feeling
8942,CHAPTER XXII,"disproportionate to such knowledge and value of the objects described,"
8943,CHAPTER XXII,"as can be fairly anticipated of men in general, even of the most"
8944,CHAPTER XXII,"cultivated classes; and with which therefore few only, and those few"
8945,CHAPTER XXII,"particularly circumstanced, can be supposed to sympathize: In this"
8946,CHAPTER XXII,"class, I comprise occasional prolixity, repetition, and an eddying,"
8947,CHAPTER XXII,"instead of progression, of thought. As instances, see pages 27, 28, and"
8948,CHAPTER XXII,"62 of the Poems, vol. I. and the first eighty lines of the VIth Book of"
8949,THE EXCURSION.,THE EXCURSION.
8950,THE EXCURSION.,
8951,THE EXCURSION.,Fifth and last; thoughts and images too great for the subject. This
8952,THE EXCURSION.,"is an approximation to what might be called mental bombast,"
8953,THE EXCURSION.,"as distinguished from verbal: for, as in the latter there is a"
8954,THE EXCURSION.,disproportion of the expressions to the thoughts so in this there is a
8955,THE EXCURSION.,"disproportion of thought to the circumstance and occasion. This, by the"
8956,THE EXCURSION.,"bye, is a fault of which none but a man of genius is capable. It is the"
8957,THE EXCURSION.,awkwardness and strength of Hercules with the distaff of Omphale.
8958,THE EXCURSION.,
8959,THE EXCURSION.,"It is a well-known fact, that bright colours in motion both make and"
8960,THE EXCURSION.,"leave the strongest impressions on the eye. Nothing is more likely too,"
8961,THE EXCURSION.,"than that a vivid image or visual spectrum, thus originated, may become"
8962,THE EXCURSION.,the link of association in recalling the feelings and images that had
8963,THE EXCURSION.,accompanied the original impression. But if we describe this in such
8964,THE EXCURSION.,"lines, as"
8965,THE EXCURSION.,
8966,THE EXCURSION.,"“They flash upon that inward eye,"
8967,THE EXCURSION.,Which is the bliss of solitude!”
8968,THE EXCURSION.,
8969,THE EXCURSION.,"in what words shall we describe the joy of retrospection, when the"
8970,THE EXCURSION.,"images and virtuous actions of a whole well-spent life, pass before that"
8971,THE EXCURSION.,conscience which is indeed the inward eye: which is indeed “the bliss
8972,THE EXCURSION.,"of solitude?” Assuredly we seem to sink most abruptly, not to say"
8973,THE EXCURSION.,"burlesquely, and almost as in a medley, from this couplet to--"
8974,THE EXCURSION.,
8975,THE EXCURSION.,"“And then my heart with pleasure fills,"
8976,THE EXCURSION.,And dances with the daffodils.”    Vol. I. p. 328.
8977,THE EXCURSION.,
8978,THE EXCURSION.,"The second instance is from vol. II. page 12, where the poet having gone"
8979,THE EXCURSION.,"out for a day’s tour of pleasure, meets early in the morning with a knot"
8980,THE EXCURSION.,"of Gipsies, who had pitched their blanket-tents and straw-beds, together"
8981,THE EXCURSION.,"with their children and asses, in some field by the road-side. At the"
8982,THE EXCURSION.,close of the day on his return our tourist found them in the same place.
8983,THE EXCURSION.,"“Twelve hours,” says he,"
8984,THE EXCURSION.,
8985,THE EXCURSION.,"“Twelve hours, twelve bounteous hours are gone, while I"
8986,THE EXCURSION.,"Have been a traveller under open sky,"
8987,THE EXCURSION.,"Much witnessing of change and cheer,"
8988,THE EXCURSION.,Yet as I left I find them here!”
8989,THE EXCURSION.,
8990,THE EXCURSION.,"Whereat the poet, without seeming to reflect that the poor tawny"
8991,THE EXCURSION.,wanderers might probably have been tramping for weeks together through
8992,THE EXCURSION.,"road and lane, over moor and mountain, and consequently must have been"
8993,THE EXCURSION.,"right glad to rest themselves, their children and cattle, for one whole"
8994,THE EXCURSION.,"day; and overlooking the obvious truth, that such repose might be quite"
8995,THE EXCURSION.,"as necessary for them, as a walk of the same continuance was pleasing"
8996,THE EXCURSION.,or healthful for the more fortunate poet; expresses his indignation in a
8997,THE EXCURSION.,"series of lines, the diction and imagery of which would have been rather"
8998,THE EXCURSION.,"above, than below the mark, had they been applied to the immense empire"
8999,THE EXCURSION.,of China improgressive for thirty centuries:
9000,THE EXCURSION.,
9001,THE EXCURSION.,“The weary Sun betook himself to rest:--
9002,THE EXCURSION.,"--Then issued Vesper from the fulgent west,"
9003,THE EXCURSION.,"Outshining, like a visible God,"
9004,THE EXCURSION.,The glorious path in which he trod.
9005,THE EXCURSION.,"And now, ascending, after one dark hour,"
9006,THE EXCURSION.,"And one night’s diminution of her power,"
9007,THE EXCURSION.,Behold the mighty Moon! this way
9008,THE EXCURSION.,"She looks, as if at them--but they"
9009,THE EXCURSION.,"Regard not her:--oh, better wrong and strife,"
9010,THE EXCURSION.,Better vain deeds or evil than such life!
9011,THE EXCURSION.,The silent Heavens have goings on
9012,THE EXCURSION.,The stars have tasks!--but these have none!”
9013,THE EXCURSION.,
9014,THE EXCURSION.,"The last instance of this defect,(for I know no other than these already"
9015,THE EXCURSION.,"cited) is from the Ode, page 351, vol. II., where, speaking of a child,"
9016,THE EXCURSION.,"“a six years’ Darling of a pigmy size,” he thus addresses him:"
9017,THE EXCURSION.,
9018,THE EXCURSION.,"“Thou best Philosopher, who yet dost keep"
9019,THE EXCURSION.,"Thy heritage, thou Eye among the blind,"
9020,THE EXCURSION.,"That, deaf and silent, read’st the eternal deep,"
9021,THE EXCURSION.,"Haunted for ever by the Eternal Mind,--"
9022,THE EXCURSION.,Mighty Prophet! Seer blest!
9023,THE EXCURSION.,"On whom those truths do rest,"
9024,THE EXCURSION.,Which we are toiling all our lives to find!
9025,THE EXCURSION.,"Thou, over whom thy Immortality"
9026,THE EXCURSION.,"Broods like the Day, a Master o’er a Slave,"
9027,THE EXCURSION.,A Present which is not to be put by!”
9028,THE EXCURSION.,
9029,THE EXCURSION.,"Now here, not to stop at the daring spirit of metaphor which connects"
9030,THE EXCURSION.,"the epithets “deaf and silent,” with the apostrophized eye: or (if we"
9031,THE EXCURSION.,"are to refer it to the preceding word, “Philosopher”), the faulty and"
9032,THE EXCURSION.,equivocal syntax of the passage; and without examining the propriety of
9033,THE EXCURSION.,"making a “Master brood o’er a Slave,” or “the Day” brood at all; we will"
9034,THE EXCURSION.,"merely ask, what does all this mean? In what sense is a child of that"
9035,THE EXCURSION.,age a Philosopher? In what sense does he read “the eternal deep?” In
9036,THE EXCURSION.,what sense is he declared to be “for ever haunted” by the Supreme Being?
9037,THE EXCURSION.,"or so inspired as to deserve the splendid titles of a Mighty Prophet, a"
9038,THE EXCURSION.,blessed Seer? By reflection? by knowledge? by conscious intuition? or
9039,THE EXCURSION.,by any form or modification of consciousness? These would be tidings
9040,THE EXCURSION.,indeed; but such as would pre-suppose an immediate revelation to
9041,THE EXCURSION.,"the inspired communicator, and require miracles to authenticate his"
9042,THE EXCURSION.,inspiration. Children at this age give us no such information of
9043,THE EXCURSION.,"themselves; and at what time were we dipped in the Lethe, which has"
9044,THE EXCURSION.,produced such utter oblivion of a state so godlike? There are many of us
9045,THE EXCURSION.,"that still possess some remembrances, more or less distinct, respecting"
9046,THE EXCURSION.,themselves at six years old; pity that the worthless straws only should
9047,THE EXCURSION.,"float, while treasures, compared with which all the mines of Golconda"
9048,THE EXCURSION.,"and Mexico were but straws, should be absorbed by some unknown gulf into"
9049,THE EXCURSION.,some unknown abyss.
9050,THE EXCURSION.,
9051,THE EXCURSION.,But if this be too wild and exorbitant to be suspected as having
9052,THE EXCURSION.,"been the poet’s meaning; if these mysterious gifts, faculties, and"
9053,THE EXCURSION.,"operations, are not accompanied with consciousness; who else is"
9054,THE EXCURSION.,"conscious of them? or how can it be called the child, if it be no part"
9055,THE EXCURSION.,"of the child’s conscious being? For aught I know, the thinking Spirit"
9056,THE EXCURSION.,"within me may be substantially one with the principle of life, and of"
9057,THE EXCURSION.,"vital operation. For aught I know, it might be employed as a secondary"
9058,THE EXCURSION.,agent in the marvellous organization and organic movements of my body.
9059,THE EXCURSION.,"But, surely, it would be strange language to say, that I construct my"
9060,THE EXCURSION.,heart! or that I propel the finer influences through my nerves! or that
9061,THE EXCURSION.,"I compress my brain, and draw the curtains of sleep round my own eyes!"
9062,THE EXCURSION.,"Spinoza and Behmen were, on different systems, both Pantheists; and"
9063,THE EXCURSION.,"among the ancients there were philosophers, teachers of the EN KAI PAN,"
9064,THE EXCURSION.,"who not only taught that God was All, but that this All constituted God."
9065,THE EXCURSION.,"Yet not even these would confound the part, as a part, with the"
9066,THE EXCURSION.,"whole, as the whole. Nay, in no system is the distinction between"
9067,THE EXCURSION.,"the individual and God, between the Modification, and the one only"
9068,THE EXCURSION.,"Substance, more sharply drawn, than in that of Spinoza. Jacobi indeed"
9069,THE EXCURSION.,"relates of Lessing, that, after a conversation with him at the house of"
9070,THE EXCURSION.,"the Poet, Gleim, (the Tyrtaeus and Anacreon of the German Parnassus,) in"
9071,THE EXCURSION.,which conversation Lessing had avowed privately to Jacobi his reluctance
9072,THE EXCURSION.,"to admit any personal existence of the Supreme Being, or the possibility"
9073,THE EXCURSION.,"of personality except in a finite Intellect, and while they were sitting"
9074,THE EXCURSION.,"at table, a shower of rain came on unexpectedly. Gleim expressed his"
9075,THE EXCURSION.,"regret at the circumstance, because they had meant to drink their"
9076,THE EXCURSION.,"wine in the garden: upon which Lessing in one of his half-earnest,"
9077,THE EXCURSION.,"half-joking moods, nodded to Jacobi, and said, “It is I, perhaps, that"
9078,THE EXCURSION.,"am doing that,” i.e. raining!--and Jacobi answered, “or perhaps I;”"
9079,THE EXCURSION.,"Gleim contented himself with staring at them both, without asking for"
9080,THE EXCURSION.,any explanation.
9081,THE EXCURSION.,
9082,THE EXCURSION.,So with regard to this passage. In what sense can the magnificent
9083,THE EXCURSION.,"attributes, above quoted, be appropriated to a child, which would not"
9084,THE EXCURSION.,"make them equally suitable to a bee, or a dog, or afield of corn: or"
9085,THE EXCURSION.,"even to a ship, or to the wind and waves that propel it? The omnipresent"
9086,THE EXCURSION.,"Spirit works equally in them, as in the child; and the child is equally"
9087,THE EXCURSION.,"unconscious of it as they. It cannot surely be, that the four lines,"
9088,THE EXCURSION.,"immediately following, are to contain the explanation?"
9089,THE EXCURSION.,
9090,THE EXCURSION.,“To whom the grave
9091,THE EXCURSION.,Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight
9092,THE EXCURSION.,"Of day or the warm light,"
9093,THE EXCURSION.,A place of thought where we in waiting lie;”--
9094,THE EXCURSION.,
9095,THE EXCURSION.,"Surely, it cannot be that this wonder-rousing apostrophe is but a"
9096,THE EXCURSION.,"comment on the little poem, “We are Seven?”--that the whole meaning of"
9097,THE EXCURSION.,"the passage is reducible to the assertion, that a child, who by the bye"
9098,THE EXCURSION.,at six years old would have been better instructed in most Christian
9099,THE EXCURSION.,"families, has no other notion of death than that of lying in a dark,"
9100,THE EXCURSION.,"cold place? And still, I hope, not as in a place of thought! not the"
9101,THE EXCURSION.,frightful notion of lying awake in his grave! The analogy between death
9102,THE EXCURSION.,"and sleep is too simple, too natural, to render so horrid a belief"
9103,THE EXCURSION.,"possible for children; even had they not been in the habit, as all"
9104,THE EXCURSION.,"Christian children are, of hearing the latter term used to express the"
9105,THE EXCURSION.,"former. But if the child’s belief be only, that “he is not dead, but"
9106,THE EXCURSION.,"sleepeth:” wherein does it differ from that of his father and mother,"
9107,THE EXCURSION.,or any other adult and instructed person? To form an idea of a thing’s
9108,THE EXCURSION.,becoming nothing; or of nothing becoming a thing; is impossible to
9109,THE EXCURSION.,"all finite beings alike, of whatever age, and however educated or"
9110,THE EXCURSION.,uneducated. Thus it is with splendid paradoxes in general. If the words
9111,THE EXCURSION.,"are taken in the common sense, they convey an absurdity; and if, in"
9112,THE EXCURSION.,"contempt of dictionaries and custom, they are so interpreted as to avoid"
9113,THE EXCURSION.,"the absurdity, the meaning dwindles into some bald truism. Thus you must"
9114,THE EXCURSION.,"at once understand the words contrary to their common import, in order"
9115,THE EXCURSION.,"to arrive at any sense; and according to their common import, if you are"
9116,THE EXCURSION.,to receive from them any feeling of sublimity or admiration.
9117,THE EXCURSION.,
9118,THE EXCURSION.,Though the instances of this defect in Mr. Wordsworth’s poems are so
9119,THE EXCURSION.,"few, that for themselves it would have been scarcely just to attract the"
9120,THE EXCURSION.,"reader’s attention toward them; yet I have dwelt on it, and perhaps the"
9121,THE EXCURSION.,"more for this very reason. For being so very few, they cannot sensibly"
9122,THE EXCURSION.,"detract from the reputation of an author, who is even characterized"
9123,THE EXCURSION.,"by the number of profound truths in his writings, which will stand"
9124,THE EXCURSION.,"the severest analysis; and yet few as they are, they are exactly those"
9125,THE EXCURSION.,"passages which his blind admirers would be most likely, and best able,"
9126,THE EXCURSION.,"to imitate. But Wordsworth, where he is indeed Wordsworth, may be"
9127,THE EXCURSION.,"mimicked by copyists, he may be plundered by plagiarists; but he cannot"
9128,THE EXCURSION.,"be imitated, except by those who are not born to be imitators. For"
9129,THE EXCURSION.,without his depth of feeling and his imaginative power his sense would
9130,THE EXCURSION.,"want its vital warmth and peculiarity; and without his strong sense, his"
9131,THE EXCURSION.,"mysticism would become sickly--mere fog, and dimness!"
9132,THE EXCURSION.,
9133,THE EXCURSION.,"To these defects which, as appears by the extracts, are only occasional,"
9134,THE EXCURSION.,"I may oppose, with far less fear of encountering the dissent of"
9135,THE EXCURSION.,"any candid and intelligent reader, the following (for the most part"
9136,THE EXCURSION.,"correspondent) excellencies. First, an austere purity of language both"
9137,THE EXCURSION.,grammatically and logically; in short a perfect appropriateness of
9138,THE EXCURSION.,"the words to the meaning. Of how high value I deem this, and how"
9139,THE EXCURSION.,"particularly estimable I hold the example at the present day, has been"
9140,THE EXCURSION.,already stated: and in part too the reasons on which I ground both the
9141,THE EXCURSION.,moral and intellectual importance of habituating ourselves to a strict
9142,THE EXCURSION.,"accuracy of expression. It is noticeable, how limited an acquaintance"
9143,THE EXCURSION.,with the masterpieces of art will suffice to form a correct and even
9144,THE EXCURSION.,"a sensitive taste, where none but master-pieces have been seen and"
9145,THE EXCURSION.,"admired: while on the other hand, the most correct notions, and the"
9146,THE EXCURSION.,widest acquaintance with the works of excellence of all ages and
9147,THE EXCURSION.,"countries, will not perfectly secure us against the contagious"
9148,THE EXCURSION.,familiarity with the far more numerous offspring of tastelessness or of
9149,THE EXCURSION.,"a perverted taste. If this be the case, as it notoriously is, with the"
9150,THE EXCURSION.,"arts of music and painting, much more difficult will it be, to avoid the"
9151,THE EXCURSION.,"infection of multiplied and daily examples in the practice of an art,"
9152,THE EXCURSION.,"which uses words, and words only, as its instruments. In poetry, in"
9153,THE EXCURSION.,"which every line, every phrase, may pass the ordeal of deliberation and"
9154,THE EXCURSION.,"deliberate choice, it is possible, and barely possible, to attain that"
9155,THE EXCURSION.,ultimatum which I have ventured to propose as the infallible test of
9156,THE EXCURSION.,a blameless style; namely: its untranslatableness in words of the same
9157,THE EXCURSION.,"language without injury to the meaning. Be it observed, however, that I"
9158,THE EXCURSION.,"include in the meaning of a word not only its correspondent object, but"
9159,THE EXCURSION.,likewise all the associations which it recalls. For language is framed
9160,THE EXCURSION.,"to convey not the object alone but likewise the character, mood and"
9161,THE EXCURSION.,intentions of the person who is representing it. In poetry it is
9162,THE EXCURSION.,practicable to preserve the diction uncorrupted by the affectations
9163,THE EXCURSION.,"and misappropriations, which promiscuous authorship, and reading not"
9164,THE EXCURSION.,promiscuous only because it is disproportionally most conversant with
9165,THE EXCURSION.,"the compositions of the day, have rendered general. Yet even to the"
9166,THE EXCURSION.,"poet, composing in his own province, it is an arduous work: and as"
9167,THE EXCURSION.,the result and pledge of a watchful good sense of fine and luminous
9168,THE EXCURSION.,"distinction, and of complete self-possession, may justly claim all the"
9169,THE EXCURSION.,"honour which belongs to an attainment equally difficult and valuable,"
9170,THE EXCURSION.,and the more valuable for being rare. It is at all times the proper food
9171,THE EXCURSION.,of the understanding; but in an age of corrupt eloquence it is both food
9172,THE EXCURSION.,and antidote.
9173,THE EXCURSION.,
9174,THE EXCURSION.,In prose I doubt whether it be even possible to preserve our style
9175,THE EXCURSION.,"wholly unalloyed by the vicious phraseology which meets us everywhere,"
9176,THE EXCURSION.,"from the sermon to the newspaper, from the harangue of the legislator"
9177,THE EXCURSION.,"to the speech from the convivial chair, announcing a toast or sentiment."
9178,THE EXCURSION.,"Our chains rattle, even while we are complaining of them. The poems of"
9179,THE EXCURSION.,Boetius rise high in our estimation when we compare them with those of
9180,THE EXCURSION.,"his contemporaries, as Sidonius Apollinaris, and others. They might even"
9181,THE EXCURSION.,"be referred to a purer age, but that the prose, in which they are"
9182,THE EXCURSION.,"set, as jewels in a crown of lead or iron, betrays the true age of the"
9183,THE EXCURSION.,writer. Much however may be effected by education. I believe not only
9184,THE EXCURSION.,"from grounds of reason, but from having in great measure assured myself"
9185,THE EXCURSION.,"of the fact by actual though limited experience, that, to a youth led"
9186,THE EXCURSION.,from his first boyhood to investigate the meaning of every word and
9187,THE EXCURSION.,"the reason of its choice and position, logic presents itself as an old"
9188,THE EXCURSION.,acquaintance under new names.
9189,THE EXCURSION.,
9190,THE EXCURSION.,"On some future occasion, more especially demanding such disquisition, I"
9191,THE EXCURSION.,shall attempt to prove the close connection between veracity and habits
9192,THE EXCURSION.,of mental accuracy; the beneficial after-effects of verbal precision in
9193,THE EXCURSION.,"the preclusion of fanaticism, which masters the feelings more especially"
9194,THE EXCURSION.,by indistinct watch-words; and to display the advantages which language
9195,THE EXCURSION.,"alone, at least which language with incomparably greater ease and"
9196,THE EXCURSION.,"certainty than any other means, presents to the instructor of impressing"
9197,THE EXCURSION.,"modes of intellectual energy so constantly, so imperceptibly, and as it"
9198,THE EXCURSION.,"were by such elements and atoms, as to secure in due time the formation"
9199,THE EXCURSION.,"of a second nature. When we reflect, that the cultivation of the"
9200,THE EXCURSION.,"judgment is a positive command of the moral law, since the reason can"
9201,THE EXCURSION.,"give the principle alone, and the conscience bears witness only to the"
9202,THE EXCURSION.,"motive, while the application and effects must depend on the judgment"
9203,THE EXCURSION.,"when we consider, that the greater part of our success and comfort in"
9204,THE EXCURSION.,"life depends on distinguishing the similar from the same, that which is"
9205,THE EXCURSION.,"peculiar in each thing from that which it has in common with others, so"
9206,THE EXCURSION.,"as still to select the most probable, instead of the merely possible or"
9207,THE EXCURSION.,"positively unfit, we shall learn to value earnestly and with a practical"
9208,THE EXCURSION.,"seriousness a mean, already prepared for us by nature and society,"
9209,THE EXCURSION.,of teaching the young mind to think well and wisely by the same
9210,THE EXCURSION.,"unremembered process and with the same never forgotten results, as those"
9211,THE EXCURSION.,by which it is taught to speak and converse. Now how much warmer
9212,THE EXCURSION.,"the interest is, how much more genial the feelings of reality and"
9213,THE EXCURSION.,"practicability, and thence how much stronger the impulses to imitation"
9214,THE EXCURSION.,"are, which a contemporary writer, and especially a contemporary poet,"
9215,THE EXCURSION.,"excites in youth and commencing manhood, has been treated of in the"
9216,THE EXCURSION.,"earlier pages of these sketches. I have only to add, that all the"
9217,THE EXCURSION.,praise which is due to the exertion of such influence for a purpose so
9218,THE EXCURSION.,"important, joined with that which must be claimed for the infrequency of"
9219,THE EXCURSION.,"the same excellence in the same perfection, belongs in full right to"
9220,THE EXCURSION.,Mr. Wordsworth. I am far however from denying that we have poets whose
9221,THE EXCURSION.,"general style possesses the same excellence, as Mr. Moore, Lord"
9222,THE EXCURSION.,"Byron, Mr. Bowles, and, in all his later and more important works, our"
9223,THE EXCURSION.,"laurel-honouring Laureate. But there are none, in whose works I do not"
9224,THE EXCURSION.,"appear to myself to find more exceptions, than in those of Wordsworth."
9225,THE EXCURSION.,"Quotations or specimens would here be wholly out of place, and must be"
9226,THE EXCURSION.,left for the critic who doubts and would invalidate the justice of this
9227,THE EXCURSION.,eulogy so applied.
9228,THE EXCURSION.,
9229,THE EXCURSION.,The second characteristic excellence of Mr. Wordsworth’s work is: a
9230,THE EXCURSION.,"correspondent weight and sanity of the Thoughts and Sentiments,--won,"
9231,THE EXCURSION.,not from books; but--from the poet’s own meditative observation. They
9232,THE EXCURSION.,"are fresh and have the dew upon them. His muse, at least when in her"
9233,THE EXCURSION.,"strength of wing, and when she hovers aloft in her proper element,"
9234,THE EXCURSION.,
9235,THE EXCURSION.,"Makes audible a linked lay of truth,"
9236,THE EXCURSION.,"Of truth profound a sweet continuous lay,"
9237,THE EXCURSION.,"Not learnt, but native, her own natural notes!"
9238,THE EXCURSION.,
9239,THE EXCURSION.,"Even throughout his smaller poems there is scarcely one, which is not"
9240,THE EXCURSION.,rendered valuable by some just and original reflection.
9241,THE EXCURSION.,
9242,THE EXCURSION.,"See page 25, vol. II.: or the two following passages in one of his"
9243,THE EXCURSION.,humblest compositions.
9244,THE EXCURSION.,
9245,THE EXCURSION.,“O Reader! had you in your mind
9246,THE EXCURSION.,"Such stores as silent thought can bring,"
9247,THE EXCURSION.,O gentle Reader! you would find
9248,THE EXCURSION.,A tale in every thing;”
9249,THE EXCURSION.,
9250,THE EXCURSION.,and
9251,THE EXCURSION.,
9252,THE EXCURSION.,"“I’ve heard of hearts unkind, kind deeds"
9253,THE EXCURSION.,With coldness still returning;
9254,THE EXCURSION.,Alas! the gratitude of men
9255,THE EXCURSION.,Has oftener left me mourning;”
9256,THE EXCURSION.,
9257,THE EXCURSION.,"or in a still higher strain the six beautiful quatrains, page 134."
9258,THE EXCURSION.,
9259,THE EXCURSION.,“Thus fares it still in our decay:
9260,THE EXCURSION.,And yet the wiser mind
9261,THE EXCURSION.,Mourns less for what age takes away
9262,THE EXCURSION.,Than what it leaves behind.
9263,THE EXCURSION.,
9264,THE EXCURSION.,"The Blackbird in the summer trees,"
9265,THE EXCURSION.,"The Lark upon the hill,"
9266,THE EXCURSION.,"Let loose their carols when they please,"
9267,THE EXCURSION.,Are quiet when they will.
9268,THE EXCURSION.,
9269,THE EXCURSION.,With Nature never do they wage
9270,THE EXCURSION.,A foolish strife; they see
9271,THE EXCURSION.,"A happy youth, and their old age"
9272,THE EXCURSION.,Is beautiful and free!
9273,THE EXCURSION.,
9274,THE EXCURSION.,But we are pressed by heavy laws;
9275,THE EXCURSION.,"And often glad no more,"
9276,THE EXCURSION.,"We wear a face of joy, because"
9277,THE EXCURSION.,We have been glad of yore.
9278,THE EXCURSION.,
9279,THE EXCURSION.,"If there is one, who need bemoan"
9280,THE EXCURSION.,"His kindred laid in earth,"
9281,THE EXCURSION.,"The household hearts that were his own,"
9282,THE EXCURSION.,It is the man of mirth.
9283,THE EXCURSION.,
9284,THE EXCURSION.,"My days, my Friend, are almost gone,"
9285,THE EXCURSION.,"My life has been approved,"
9286,THE EXCURSION.,And many love me; but by none
9287,THE EXCURSION.,Am I enough beloved;”
9288,THE EXCURSION.,
9289,THE EXCURSION.,"or the sonnet on Buonaparte, page 202, vol. II. or finally (for a volume"
9290,THE EXCURSION.,"would scarce suffice to exhaust the instances,) the last stanza of the"
9291,THE EXCURSION.,"poem on the withered Celandine, vol. II. p. 312."
9292,THE EXCURSION.,
9293,THE EXCURSION.,"“To be a Prodigal’s Favorite--then, worse truth,"
9294,THE EXCURSION.,A Miser’s Pensioner--behold our lot!
9295,THE EXCURSION.,O Man! That from thy fair and shining youth
9296,THE EXCURSION.,Age might but take the things Youth needed not.”
9297,THE EXCURSION.,
9298,THE EXCURSION.,"Both in respect of this and of the former excellence, Mr. Wordsworth"
9299,THE EXCURSION.,"strikingly resembles Samuel Daniel, one of the golden writers of our"
9300,THE EXCURSION.,"golden Elizabethan age, now most causelessly neglected: Samuel Daniel,"
9301,THE EXCURSION.,"whose diction bears no mark of time, no distinction of age which"
9302,THE EXCURSION.,"has been, and as long as our language shall last, will be so far the"
9303,THE EXCURSION.,"language of the to-day and for ever, as that it is more intelligible to"
9304,THE EXCURSION.,"us, than the transitory fashions of our own particular age. A similar"
9305,THE EXCURSION.,praise is due to his sentiments. No frequency of perusal can deprive
9306,THE EXCURSION.,them of their freshness. For though they are brought into the full
9307,THE EXCURSION.,day-light of every reader’s comprehension; yet are they drawn up from
9308,THE EXCURSION.,"depths which few in any age are privileged to visit, into which few in"
9309,THE EXCURSION.,any age have courage or inclination to descend. If Mr. Wordsworth is
9310,THE EXCURSION.,not equally with Daniel alike intelligible to all readers of average
9311,THE EXCURSION.,"understanding in all passages of his works, the comparative difficulty"
9312,THE EXCURSION.,"does not arise from the greater impurity of the ore, but from the nature"
9313,THE EXCURSION.,"and uses of the metal. A poem is not necessarily obscure, because it"
9314,THE EXCURSION.,"does not aim to be popular. It is enough, if a work be perspicuous to"
9315,THE EXCURSION.,"those for whom it is written, and"
9316,THE EXCURSION.,
9317,THE EXCURSION.,"“Fit audience find, though few.”"
9318,THE EXCURSION.,
9319,THE EXCURSION.,To the “Ode on the Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of
9320,THE EXCURSION.,early Childhood” the poet might have prefixed the lines which Dante
9321,THE EXCURSION.,addresses to one of his own Canzoni--
9322,THE EXCURSION.,
9323,THE EXCURSION.,"“Canzone, i’ credo, che saranno radi"
9324,THE EXCURSION.,"Color, che tua ragione intendan bene,"
9325,THE EXCURSION.,Tanto lor sei faticoso ed alto.”
9326,THE EXCURSION.,
9327,THE EXCURSION.,"“O lyric song, there will be few, I think,"
9328,THE EXCURSION.,Who may thy import understand aright:
9329,THE EXCURSION.,Thou art for them so arduous and so high!”
9330,THE EXCURSION.,
9331,THE EXCURSION.,But the ode was intended for such readers only as had been accustomed
9332,THE EXCURSION.,"to watch the flux and reflux of their inmost nature, to venture at times"
9333,THE EXCURSION.,"into the twilight realms of consciousness, and to feel a deep interest"
9334,THE EXCURSION.,"in modes of inmost being, to which they know that the attributes of time"
9335,THE EXCURSION.,"and space are inapplicable and alien, but which yet can not be conveyed,"
9336,THE EXCURSION.,save in symbols of time and space. For such readers the sense is
9337,THE EXCURSION.,"sufficiently plain, and they will be as little disposed to charge Mr."
9338,THE EXCURSION.,Wordsworth with believing the Platonic pre-existence in the ordinary
9339,THE EXCURSION.,"interpretation of the words, as I am to believe, that Plato himself ever"
9340,THE EXCURSION.,meant or taught it.
9341,THE EXCURSION.,

9353,THE EXCURSION.,
9354,THE EXCURSION.,Third (and wherein he soars far above Daniel) the sinewy strength
9355,THE EXCURSION.,and originality of single lines and paragraphs: the frequent curiosa
9356,THE EXCURSION.,"felicitas of his diction, of which I need not here give specimens,"
9357,THE EXCURSION.,"having anticipated them in a preceding page. This beauty, and as"
9358,THE EXCURSION.,"eminently characteristic of Wordsworth’s poetry, his rudest assailants"
9359,THE EXCURSION.,have felt themselves compelled to acknowledge and admire.
9360,THE EXCURSION.,
9361,THE EXCURSION.,Fourth; the perfect truth of nature in his images and descriptions as
9362,THE EXCURSION.,"taken immediately from nature, and proving a long and genial intimacy"
9363,THE EXCURSION.,with the very spirit which gives the physiognomic expression to all the
9364,THE EXCURSION.,works of nature. Like a green field reflected in a calm and perfectly
9365,THE EXCURSION.,"transparent lake, the image is distinguished from the reality only by"
9366,THE EXCURSION.,its greater softness and lustre. Like the moisture or the polish on a
9367,THE EXCURSION.,"pebble, genius neither distorts nor false-colours its objects; but on"
9368,THE EXCURSION.,"the contrary brings out many a vein and many a tint, which escape the"
9369,THE EXCURSION.,"eye of common observation, thus raising to the rank of gems what had"
9370,THE EXCURSION.,been often kicked away by the hurrying foot of the traveller on the
9371,THE EXCURSION.,dusty high road of custom.
9372,THE EXCURSION.,
9373,THE EXCURSION.,"Let me refer to the whole description of skating, vol. I. page 42 to 47,"
9374,THE EXCURSION.,especially to the lines
9375,THE EXCURSION.,
9376,THE EXCURSION.,"“So through the darkness and the cold we flew,"
9377,THE EXCURSION.,And not a voice was idle. with the din
9378,THE EXCURSION.,Meanwhile the precipices rang aloud;
9379,THE EXCURSION.,The leafless trees and every icy crag
9380,THE EXCURSION.,Tinkled like iron; while the distant hills
9381,THE EXCURSION.,Into the tumult sent an alien sound
9382,THE EXCURSION.,"Of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars,"
9383,THE EXCURSION.,"Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west"
9384,THE EXCURSION.,The orange sky of evening died away.”
9385,THE EXCURSION.,
9386,THE EXCURSION.,"Or to the poem on THE GREEN LINNET, vol. I. page 244. What can be more"
9387,THE EXCURSION.,accurate yet more lovely than the two concluding stanzas?
9388,THE EXCURSION.,
9389,THE EXCURSION.,"“Upon yon tuft of hazel trees,"
9390,THE EXCURSION.,"That twinkle to the gusty breeze,"
9391,THE EXCURSION.,"Behold him perched in ecstasies,"
9392,THE EXCURSION.,Yet seeming still to hover;
9393,THE EXCURSION.,There! where the flutter of his wings
9394,THE EXCURSION.,Upon his back and body flings
9395,THE EXCURSION.,"Shadows and sunny glimmerings,"
9396,THE EXCURSION.,That cover him all over.
9397,THE EXCURSION.,
9398,THE EXCURSION.,"While thus before my eyes he gleams,"
9399,THE EXCURSION.,A Brother of the Leaves he seems;
9400,THE EXCURSION.,When in a moment forth he teems
9401,THE EXCURSION.,His little song in gushes
9402,THE EXCURSION.,As if it pleased him to disdain
9403,THE EXCURSION.,And mock the Form which he did feign
9404,THE EXCURSION.,While he was dancing with the train
9405,THE EXCURSION.,Of Leaves among the bushes.”
9406,THE EXCURSION.,
9407,THE EXCURSION.,"Or the description of the blue-cap, and of the noontide silence, page"
9408,THE EXCURSION.,"284; or the poem to the cuckoo, page 299; or, lastly, though I might"
9409,THE EXCURSION.,"multiply the references to ten times the number, to the poem, so"
9410,THE EXCURSION.,"completely Wordsworth’s, commencing"
9411,THE EXCURSION.,
9412,THE EXCURSION.,“Three years she grew in sun and shower”--
9413,THE EXCURSION.,
9414,THE EXCURSION.,"Fifth: a meditative pathos, a union of deep and subtle thought with"
9415,THE EXCURSION.,sensibility; a sympathy with man as man; the sympathy indeed of a
9416,THE EXCURSION.,"contemplator, rather than a fellow-sufferer or co-mate, (spectator, haud"
9417,THE EXCURSION.,"particeps) but of a contemplator, from whose view no difference of rank"
9418,THE EXCURSION.,"conceals the sameness of the nature; no injuries of wind or weather, or"
9419,THE EXCURSION.,"toil, or even of ignorance, wholly disguise the human face divine. The"
9420,THE EXCURSION.,superscription and the image of the Creator still remain legible to
9421,THE EXCURSION.,"him under the dark lines, with which guilt or calamity had cancelled or"
9422,THE EXCURSION.,cross-barred it. Here the Man and the Poet lose and find themselves in
9423,THE EXCURSION.,"each other, the one as glorified, the latter as substantiated. In this"
9424,THE EXCURSION.,"mild and philosophic pathos, Wordsworth appears to me without a compeer."
9425,THE EXCURSION.,"Such as he is: so he writes. See vol. I. page 134 to 136, or that most"
9426,THE EXCURSION.,"affecting composition, THE AFFLICTION OF MARGARET ---- OF ----, page 165"
9427,THE EXCURSION.,"to 168, which no mother, and, if I may judge by my own experience, no"
9428,THE EXCURSION.,"parent can read without a tear. Or turn to that genuine lyric, in the"
9429,THE EXCURSION.,"former edition, entitled, THE MAD MOTHER, page 174 to 178, of which I"
9430,THE EXCURSION.,"cannot refrain from quoting two of the stanzas, both of them for their"
9431,THE EXCURSION.,"pathos, and the former for the fine transition in the two concluding"
9432,THE EXCURSION.,"lines of the stanza, so expressive of that deranged state, in which,"
9433,THE EXCURSION.,"from the increased sensibility, the sufferer’s attention is abruptly"
9434,THE EXCURSION.,"drawn off by every trifle, and in the same instant plucked back again by"
9435,THE EXCURSION.,"the one despotic thought, bringing home with it, by the blending, fusing"
9436,THE EXCURSION.,"power of Imagination and Passion, the alien object to which it had been"
9437,THE EXCURSION.,"so abruptly diverted, no longer an alien but an ally and an inmate."
9438,THE EXCURSION.,
9439,THE EXCURSION.,"“Suck, little babe, oh suck again!"
9440,THE EXCURSION.,It cools my blood; it cools my brain;
9441,THE EXCURSION.,"Thy lips, I feel them, baby! They"
9442,THE EXCURSION.,Draw from my heart the pain away.
9443,THE EXCURSION.,Oh! press me with thy little hand;
9444,THE EXCURSION.,It loosens something at my chest
9445,THE EXCURSION.,About that tight and deadly band
9446,THE EXCURSION.,I feel thy little fingers prest.
9447,THE EXCURSION.,The breeze I see is in the tree!
9448,THE EXCURSION.,It comes to cool my babe and me.”
9449,THE EXCURSION.,
9450,THE EXCURSION.,"“Thy father cares not for my breast,"
9451,THE EXCURSION.,"’Tis thine, sweet baby, there to rest;"
9452,THE EXCURSION.,’Tis all thine own!--and if its hue
9453,THE EXCURSION.,"Be changed, that was so fair to view,"
9454,THE EXCURSION.,"’Tis fair enough for thee, my dove!"
9455,THE EXCURSION.,"My beauty, little child, is flown,"
9456,THE EXCURSION.,But thou wilt live with me in love;
9457,THE EXCURSION.,And what if my poor cheek be brown?
9458,THE EXCURSION.,"’Tis well for me, thou canst not see"
9459,THE EXCURSION.,How pale and wan it else would be.”
9460,THE EXCURSION.,
9461,THE EXCURSION.,"Last, and pre-eminently, I challenge for this poet the gift of"
9462,THE EXCURSION.,Imagination in the highest and strictest sense of the word. In the
9463,THE EXCURSION.,"play of fancy, Wordsworth, to my feelings, is not always graceful,"
9464,THE EXCURSION.,"and sometimes recondite. The likeness is occasionally too strange, or"
9465,THE EXCURSION.,"demands too peculiar a point of view, or is such as appears the creature"
9466,THE EXCURSION.,"of predetermined research, rather than spontaneous presentation. Indeed"
9467,THE EXCURSION.,"his fancy seldom displays itself, as mere and unmodified fancy. But"
9468,THE EXCURSION.,"in imaginative power, he stands nearest of all modern writers to"
9469,THE EXCURSION.,Shakespeare and Milton; and yet in a kind perfectly unborrowed and
9470,THE EXCURSION.,"his own. To employ his own words, which are at once an instance and an"
9471,THE EXCURSION.,"illustration, he does indeed to all thoughts and to all objects--"
9472,THE EXCURSION.,
9473,THE EXCURSION.,"“------add the gleam,"
9474,THE EXCURSION.,"The light that never was, on sea or land,"
9475,THE EXCURSION.,"The consecration, and the Poet’s dream.”"
9476,THE EXCURSION.,
9477,THE EXCURSION.,I shall select a few examples as most obviously manifesting this
9478,THE EXCURSION.,faculty; but if I should ever be fortunate enough to render my analysis
9479,THE EXCURSION.,"of Imagination, its origin and characters, thoroughly intelligible to"
9480,THE EXCURSION.,"the reader, he will scarcely open on a page of this poet’s works without"
9481,THE EXCURSION.,"recognising, more or less, the presence and the influences of this"
9482,THE EXCURSION.,"faculty. From the poem on the YEW TREES, vol. I. page 303, 304."

9484,THE EXCURSION.,“But worthier still of note
9485,THE EXCURSION.,"Are those fraternal Four of Borrowdale,"

9488,THE EXCURSION.,Of intertwisted fibres serpentine
9489,THE EXCURSION.,"Up-coiling, and inveterately convolved;"
9490,THE EXCURSION.,"Not uninformed with phantasy, and looks"

9492,THE EXCURSION.,"Upon whose grassless floor of red-brown hue,"
9493,THE EXCURSION.,By sheddings from the pinal umbrage tinged
9494,THE EXCURSION.,Perennially--beneath whose sable roof
9495,THE EXCURSION.,"Of boughs, as if for festal purpose, decked"

9500,THE EXCURSION.,As in a natural temple scattered o’er
9501,THE EXCURSION.,"With altars undisturbed of mossy stone,"
9502,THE EXCURSION.,United worship; or in mute repose
9503,THE EXCURSION.,"To lie, and listen to the mountain flood"

9542,THE EXCURSION.,“O joy! that in our embers
9543,THE EXCURSION.,"Is something that doth live,"
9544,THE EXCURSION.,That nature yet remembers
9545,THE EXCURSION.,What was so fugitive!
9546,THE EXCURSION.,The thought of our past years in me doth breed
9547,THE EXCURSION.,Perpetual benedictions: not indeed
9548,THE EXCURSION.,For that which is most worthy to be blest;
9549,THE EXCURSION.,"Delight and liberty, the simple creed"
9550,THE EXCURSION.,"Of Childhood, whether busy or at rest,"
9551,THE EXCURSION.,With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:--
9552,THE EXCURSION.,Not for these I raise
9553,THE EXCURSION.,The song of thanks and praise;
9554,THE EXCURSION.,But for those obstinate questionings
9555,THE EXCURSION.,"Of sense and outward things,"
9556,THE EXCURSION.,"Fallings from us, vanishings;"
9557,THE EXCURSION.,Blank misgivings of a Creature
9558,THE EXCURSION.,"Moving about in worlds not realized,"
9559,THE EXCURSION.,"High instincts, before which our mortal Nature"
9560,THE EXCURSION.,Did tremble like a guilty Thing surprised!
9561,THE EXCURSION.,"But for those first affections,"
9562,THE EXCURSION.,"Those shadowy recollections,"
9563,THE EXCURSION.,"Which, be they what they may,"
9564,THE EXCURSION.,"Are yet the fountain light of all our day,"
9565,THE EXCURSION.,Are yet a master light of all our seeing;
9566,THE EXCURSION.,Uphold us--cherish--and have power to make
9567,THE EXCURSION.,Our noisy years seem moments in the being
9568,THE EXCURSION.,Of the eternal Silence; truths that wake
9569,THE EXCURSION.,To perish never;
9570,THE EXCURSION.,"Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,"
9571,THE EXCURSION.,"Nor Man nor Boy,"
9572,THE EXCURSION.,"Nor all that is at enmity with joy,"
9573,THE EXCURSION.,Can utterly abolish or destroy!

9576,THE EXCURSION.,Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea
9577,THE EXCURSION.,Which brought us hither;
9578,THE EXCURSION.,"Can in a moment travel thither,--"

9581,THE EXCURSION.,
9582,THE EXCURSION.,"And since it would be unfair to conclude with an extract, which, though"

9584,THE EXCURSION.,"subject, be interesting or perhaps intelligible, to but a limited number"
9585,THE EXCURSION.,"of readers; I will add, from the poet’s last published work, a passage"
9586,THE EXCURSION.,"equally Wordsworthian; of the beauty of which, and of the imaginative"

9590,THE EXCURSION.,“Fast the church-yard fills;--anon
9591,THE EXCURSION.,Look again and they all are gone;
9592,THE EXCURSION.,"The cluster round the porch, and the folk"
9593,THE EXCURSION.,Who sate in the shade of the Prior’s Oak!
9594,THE EXCURSION.,And scarcely have they disappeared
9595,THE EXCURSION.,Ere the prelusive hymn is heard;--
9596,THE EXCURSION.,"With one consent the people rejoice,"
9597,THE EXCURSION.,Filling the church with a lofty voice!
9598,THE EXCURSION.,They sing a service which they feel:
9599,THE EXCURSION.,For ’tis the sun-rise now of zeal;
9600,THE EXCURSION.,And faith and hope are in their prime
9601,THE EXCURSION.,In great Eliza’s golden time.”

9606,THE EXCURSION.,"Recites the holy liturgy,"
9607,THE EXCURSION.,The only voice which you can hear
9608,THE EXCURSION.,Is the river murmuring near.
9609,THE EXCURSION.,"--When soft!--the dusky trees between,"
9610,THE EXCURSION.,"And down the path through the open green,"
9611,THE EXCURSION.,Where is no living thing to be seen;
9612,THE EXCURSION.,"And through yon gateway, where is found,"
9613,THE EXCURSION.,"Beneath the arch with ivy bound,"
9614,THE EXCURSION.,Free entrance to the church-yard ground--
9615,THE EXCURSION.,"And right across the verdant sod,"
9616,THE EXCURSION.,Towards the very house of God;
9617,THE EXCURSION.,"Comes gliding in with lovely gleam,"
9618,THE EXCURSION.,"Comes gliding in serene and slow,"
9619,THE EXCURSION.,Soft and silent as a dream.
9620,THE EXCURSION.,A solitary Doe!
9621,THE EXCURSION.,"White she is as lily of June,"
9622,THE EXCURSION.,And beauteous as the silver moon
9623,THE EXCURSION.,When out of sight the clouds are driven
9624,THE EXCURSION.,And she is left alone in heaven!
9625,THE EXCURSION.,Or like a ship some gentle day
9626,THE EXCURSION.,In sunshine sailing far away
9627,THE EXCURSION.,A glittering ship that hath the plain
9628,THE EXCURSION.,Of ocean for her own domain.”
9629,THE EXCURSION.,
9630,THE EXCURSION.,*     *     *     *     *     *
9631,THE EXCURSION.,
9632,THE EXCURSION.,“What harmonious pensive changes
9633,THE EXCURSION.,Wait upon her as she ranges
9634,THE EXCURSION.,Round and through this Pile of state
9635,THE EXCURSION.,Overthrown and desolate!
9636,THE EXCURSION.,Now a step or two her way
9637,THE EXCURSION.,"Is through space of open day,"
9638,THE EXCURSION.,Where the enamoured sunny light
9639,THE EXCURSION.,Brightens her that was so bright;
9640,THE EXCURSION.,"Now doth a delicate shadow fall,"
9641,THE EXCURSION.,"Falls upon her like a breath,"
9642,THE EXCURSION.,"From some lofty arch or wall,"
9643,THE EXCURSION.,As she passes underneath.”
9644,THE EXCURSION.,
9645,THE EXCURSION.,"The following analogy will, I am apprehensive, appear dim and fantastic,"
9646,THE EXCURSION.,but in reading Bartram’s Travels I could not help transcribing the
9647,THE EXCURSION.,"following lines as a sort of allegory, or connected simile and metaphor"
9648,THE EXCURSION.,"of Wordsworth’s intellect and genius.--“The soil is a deep, rich, dark"
9649,THE EXCURSION.,"mould, on a deep stratum of tenacious clay; and that on a foundation of"
9650,THE EXCURSION.,"rocks, which often break through both strata, lifting their backs above"
9651,THE EXCURSION.,"the surface. The trees which chiefly grow here are the gigantic, black"
9652,THE EXCURSION.,oak; magnolia grandi-flora; fraximus excelsior; platane; and a few
9653,THE EXCURSION.,"stately tulip trees.” What Mr. Wordsworth will produce, it is not for me"
9654,THE EXCURSION.,to prophesy but I could pronounce with the liveliest convictions what he
9655,THE EXCURSION.,is capable of producing. It is the FIRST GENUINE PHILOSOPHIC POEM.
9656,THE EXCURSION.,
9657,THE EXCURSION.,"The preceding criticism will not, I am aware, avail to overcome the"
9658,THE EXCURSION.,"prejudices of those, who have made it a business to attack and ridicule"
9659,THE EXCURSION.,Mr. Wordsworth’s compositions.
9660,THE EXCURSION.,
9661,THE EXCURSION.,Truth and prudence might be imaged as concentric circles. The poet may
9662,THE EXCURSION.,"perhaps have passed beyond the latter, but he has confined himself far"
9663,THE EXCURSION.,"within the bounds of the former, in designating these critics, as “too"
9664,THE EXCURSION.,"petulant to be passive to a genuine poet, and too feeble to grapple with"
9665,THE EXCURSION.,"him;----men of palsied imaginations, in whose minds all healthy action"
9666,THE EXCURSION.,"is languid;----who, therefore, feed as the many direct them, or with the"
9667,THE EXCURSION.,many are greedy after vicious provocatives.”
9668,THE EXCURSION.,
9669,THE EXCURSION.,"So much for the detractors from Wordsworth’s merits. On the other hand,"
9670,THE EXCURSION.,"much as I might wish for their fuller sympathy, I dare not flatter"
9671,THE EXCURSION.,"myself, that the freedom with which I have declared my opinions"
9672,THE EXCURSION.,"concerning both his theory and his defects, most of which are more"
9673,THE EXCURSION.,"or less connected with his theory, either as cause or effect, will be"
9674,THE EXCURSION.,satisfactory or pleasing to all the poet’s admirers and advocates.
9675,THE EXCURSION.,More indiscriminate than mine their admiration may be: deeper and more
9676,THE EXCURSION.,sincere it cannot be. But I have advanced no opinion either for praise
9677,THE EXCURSION.,"or censure, other than as texts introductory to the reasons which compel"
9678,THE EXCURSION.,"me to form it. Above all, I was fully convinced that such a criticism"
9679,THE EXCURSION.,"was not only wanted; but that, if executed with adequate ability, it"
9680,THE EXCURSION.,"must conduce, in no mean degree, to Mr. Wordsworth’s reputation."
9681,THE EXCURSION.,"His fame belongs to another age, and can neither be accelerated nor"
9682,THE EXCURSION.,"retarded. How small the proportion of the defects are to the beauties,"
9683,THE EXCURSION.,I have repeatedly declared; and that no one of them originates in
9684,THE EXCURSION.,"deficiency of poetic genius. Had they been more and greater, I should"
9685,THE EXCURSION.,"still, as a friend to his literary character in the present age,"
9686,THE EXCURSION.,"consider an analytic display of them as pure gain; if only it removed,"
9687,THE EXCURSION.,as surely to all reflecting minds even the foregoing analysis must have
9688,THE EXCURSION.,"removed, the strange mistake, so slightly grounded, yet so widely and"
9689,THE EXCURSION.,"industriously propagated, of Mr. Wordsworth’s turn for simplicity! I"
9690,THE EXCURSION.,am not half as much irritated by hearing his enemies abuse him for
9691,THE EXCURSION.,"vulgarity of style, subject, and conception, as I am disgusted with the"
9692,THE EXCURSION.,"gilded side of the same meaning, as displayed by some affected admirers,"
9693,THE EXCURSION.,"with whom he is, forsooth, a “sweet, simple poet!” and so natural, that"
9694,THE EXCURSION.,"little master Charles and his younger sister are so charmed with them,"
9695,THE EXCURSION.,"that they play at “Goody Blake,” or at “Johnny and Betty Foy!”"
9696,THE EXCURSION.,
9697,THE EXCURSION.,"Were the collection of poems, published with these biographical"
9698,THE EXCURSION.,"sketches, important enough, (which I am not vain enough to believe,)"
9699,THE EXCURSION.,"to deserve such a distinction; even as I have done, so would I be done"
9700,THE EXCURSION.,unto.

9705,THE EXCURSION.,"which are alone natural to me under the circumstances of late years, I"
9706,THE EXCURSION.,would fain present myself to the Reader as I was in the first dawn of my
9707,THE EXCURSION.,literary life:

9726,LETTER I,
9727,LETTER I,"On Sunday morning, September 16, 1798, the Hamburg packet set sail from"
9728,LETTER I,"Yarmouth; and I, for the first time in my life, beheld my native land"
9729,LETTER I,"retiring from me. At the moment of its disappearance--in all the kirks,"
9730,LETTER I,"churches, chapels, and meeting-houses, in which the greater number, I"
9731,LETTER I,"hope, of my countrymen were at that time assembled, I will dare question"
9732,LETTER I,"whether there was one more ardent prayer offered up to heaven, than"
9733,LETTER I,"that which I then preferred for my country. “Now then,” (said I to a"
9734,LETTER I,"gentleman who was standing near me,) “we are out of our country.” “Not"
9735,LETTER I,"yet, not yet!” he replied, and pointed to the sea; “This, too, is a"
9736,LETTER I,"Briton’s country.” This bon mot gave a fillip to my spirits, I rose and"
9737,LETTER I,"looked round on my fellow-passengers, who were all on the deck. We"
9738,LETTER I,"were eighteen in number, videlicet, five Englishmen, an English lady,"
9739,LETTER I,"a French gentleman and his servant, an Hanoverian and his servant, a"
9740,LETTER I,"Prussian, a Swede, two Danes, and a Mulatto boy, a German tailor and his"
9741,LETTER I,"wife, (the smallest couple I ever beheld,) and a Jew. We were all on the"
9742,LETTER I,deck; but in a short time I observed marks of dismay. The lady retired
9743,LETTER I,"to the cabin in some confusion, and many of the faces round me assumed a"
9744,LETTER I,very doleful and frog-coloured appearance; and within an hour the number
9745,LETTER I,"of those on deck was lessened by one half. I was giddy, but not sick,"
9746,LETTER I,"and the giddiness soon went away, but left a feverishness and want of"
9747,LETTER I,"appetite, which I attributed, in great measure, to the saeva Mephitis of"
9748,LETTER I,the bilge-water; and it was certainly not decreased by the exportations
9749,LETTER I,"from the cabin. However, I was well enough to join the able-bodied"
9750,LETTER I,"passengers, one of whom observed not inaptly, that Momus might have"
9751,LETTER I,"discovered an easier way to see a man’s inside, than by placing a"
9752,LETTER I,window in his breast. He needed only have taken a saltwater trip in a
9753,LETTER I,packet-boat.
9754,LETTER I,
9755,LETTER I,"I am inclined to believe, that a packet is far superior to a"
9756,LETTER I,"stage-coach, as a means of making men open out to each other. In the"
9757,LETTER I,"latter the uniformity of posture disposes to dozing, and the"
9758,LETTER I,"definitiveness of the period, at which the company will separate, makes"
9759,LETTER I,"each individual think more of those to whom he is going, than of those"
9760,LETTER I,"with whom he is going. But at sea, more curiosity is excited, if only"
9761,LETTER I,"on this account, that the pleasant or unpleasant qualities of your"
9762,LETTER I,"companions are of greater importance to you, from the uncertainty how"
9763,LETTER I,"long you may be obliged to house with them. Besides, if you are"
9764,LETTER I,"countrymen, that now begins to form a distinction and a bond of"
9765,LETTER I,"brotherhood; and if of different countries, there are new incitements"
9766,LETTER I,"of conversation, more to ask and more to communicate. I found that I"
9767,LETTER I,had interested the Danes in no common degree. I had crept into the boat
9768,LETTER I,"on the deck and fallen asleep; but was awakened by one of them, about"
9769,LETTER I,"three o’clock in the afternoon, who told me that they had been seeking"
9770,LETTER I,"me in every hole and corner, and insisted that I should join their"
9771,LETTER I,"party and drink with them. He talked English with such fluency, as left"
9772,LETTER I,me wholly unable to account for the singular and even ludicrous
9773,LETTER I,"incorrectness with which he spoke it. I went, and found some excellent"
9774,LETTER I,wines and a dessert of grapes with a pine-apple. The Danes had
9775,LETTER I,"christened me Doctor Teology, and dressed as I was all in black, with"
9776,LETTER I,"large shoes and black worsted stockings, I might certainly have passed"
9777,LETTER I,very well for a Methodist missionary. However I disclaimed my title.
9778,LETTER I,What then may you be? A man of fortune? No!--A merchant? No!--A
9779,LETTER I,"merchant’s traveller? No!--A clerk? No!--Un Philosophe, perhaps? It was"
9780,LETTER I,"at that time in my life, in which of all possible names and characters"
9781,LETTER I,I had the greatest disgust to that of “un Philosophe.” But I was weary
9782,LETTER I,"of being questioned, and rather than be nothing, or at best only the"
9783,LETTER I,"abstract idea of a man, I submitted by a bow, even to the aspersion"
9784,LETTER I,"implied in the word “un Philosophe.”--The Dane then informed me, that"
9785,LETTER I,all in the present party were Philosophers likewise. Certes we were not
9786,LETTER I,"of the Stoick school. For we drank and talked and sung, till we talked"
9787,LETTER I,and sung all together; and then we rose and danced on the deck a set of
9788,LETTER I,"dances, which in one sense of the word at least, were very intelligibly"
9789,LETTER I,"and appropriately entitled reels. The passengers, who lay in the cabin"
9790,LETTER I,"below in all the agonies of sea-sickness, must have found our"
9791,LETTER I,bacchanalian merriment
9792,LETTER I,
9793,LETTER I,------a tune
9794,LETTER I,Harsh and of dissonant mood from their complaint.
9795,LETTER I,
9796,LETTER I,"I thought so at the time; and, (by way, I suppose, of supporting my"
9797,LETTER I,"newly assumed philosophical character,) I thought too, how closely the"
9798,LETTER I,"greater number of our virtues are connected with the fear of death, and"
9799,LETTER I,"how little sympathy we bestow on pain, where there is no danger."
9800,LETTER I,
9801,LETTER I,The two Danes were brothers. The one was a man with a clear white
9802,LETTER I,"complexion, white hair, and white eyebrows; looked silly, and nothing"
9803,LETTER I,"that he uttered gave the lie to his looks. The other, whom, by way of"
9804,LETTER I,"eminence I have called the Dane, had likewise white hair, but was much"
9805,LETTER I,"shorter than his brother, with slender limbs, and a very thin face"
9806,LETTER I,slightly pockfretten. This man convinced me of the justice of an old
9807,LETTER I,"remark, that many a faithful portrait in our novels and farces has been"
9808,LETTER I,"rashly censured for an outrageous caricature, or perhaps nonentity. I"
9809,LETTER I,had retired to my station in the boat--he came and seated himself by my
9810,LETTER I,"side, and appeared not a little tipsy. He commenced the conversation in"
9811,LETTER I,"the most magnific style, and, as a sort of pioneering to his own vanity,"
9812,LETTER I,he flattered me with such grossness! The parasites of the old comedy
9813,LETTER I,were modest in the comparison. His language and accentuation were so
9814,LETTER I,"exceedingly singular, that I determined for once in my life to take"
9815,LETTER I,"notes of a conversation. Here it follows, somewhat abridged, indeed, but"
9816,LETTER I,in all other respects as accurately as my memory permitted.
9817,LETTER I,
9818,LETTER I,THE DANE. Vat imagination! vat language! vat vast science! and vat eyes!
9819,LETTER I,"vat a milk-vite forehead! O my heafen! vy, you’re a Got!"
9820,LETTER I,
9821,LETTER I,"ANSWER. You do me too much honour, Sir."
9822,LETTER I,
9823,LETTER I,"THE DANE. O me! if you should dink I is flattering you!--No, no, no! I"
9824,LETTER I,"haf ten tousand a year--yes, ten tousand a year--yes, ten tousand pound"
9825,LETTER I,a year! Vel--and vat is dhat? a mere trifle! I ’ouldn’t gif my sincere
9826,LETTER I,"heart for ten times dhe money. Yes, you’re a Got! I a mere man! But, my"
9827,LETTER I,"dear friend! dhink of me, as a man! Is, is--I mean to ask you now, my"
9828,LETTER I,dear friend--is I not very eloquent? Is I not speak English very fine?
9829,LETTER I,
9830,LETTER I,"ANSWER. Most admirably! Believe me, Sir! I have seldom heard even a"
9831,LETTER I,native talk so fluently.
9832,LETTER I,
9833,LETTER I,THE DANE. (Squeezing my hand with great vehemence.) My dear friend! vat
9834,LETTER I,"an affection and fidelity ve have for each odher! But tell me, do tell"
9835,LETTER I,"me,--Is I not, now and den, speak some fault? Is I not in some wrong?"
9836,LETTER I,
9837,LETTER I,"ANSWER. Why, Sir! perhaps it might be observed by nice critics in the"
9838,LETTER I,"English language, that you occasionally use the word “is” instead of"
9839,LETTER I,"“am.” In our best companies we generally say I am, and not I is or I’se."
9840,LETTER I,"Excuse me, Sir! it is a mere trifle."
9841,LETTER I,
9842,LETTER I,"THE DANE. O!--is, is, am, am, am. Yes, yes--I know, I know."
9843,LETTER I,
9844,LETTER I,"ANSWER. I am, thou art, he is, we are, ye are, they are."
9845,LETTER I,
9846,LETTER I,"THE DANE. Yes, yes,--I know, I know--Am, am, am, is dhe praesens, and is"
9847,LETTER I,"is dhe perfectum--yes, yes--and are is dhe plusquam perfectum."
9848,LETTER I,
9849,LETTER I,"ANSWER. And art, Sir! is--?"
9850,LETTER I,
9851,LETTER I,"THE DANE. My dear friend! it is dhe plusquam perfectum, no, no--dhat"
9852,LETTER I,is a great lie; are is dhe plusquam perfectum--and art is dhe plasquam
9853,LETTER I,"plue-perfectum--(then swinging my hand to and fro, and cocking his"
9854,LETTER I,"little bright hazel eyes at me, that danced with vanity and wine)--You"
9855,LETTER I,"see, my dear friend that I too have some lehrning?"
9856,LETTER I,
9857,LETTER I,"ANSWER. Learning, Sir? Who dares suspect it? Who can listen to you for a"
9858,LETTER I,"minute, who can even look at you, without perceiving the extent of it?"
9859,LETTER I,
9860,LETTER I,"THE DANE. My dear friend!--(then with a would-be humble look, and in a"
9861,LETTER I,tone of voice as if he was reasoning) I could not talk so of prawns and
9862,LETTER I,"imperfectum, and futurum and plusquamplue perfectum, and all dhat, my"
9863,LETTER I,dear friend! without some lehrning?
9864,LETTER I,
9865,LETTER I,ANSWER. Sir! a man like you cannot talk on any subject without
9866,LETTER I,discovering the depth of his information.
9867,LETTER I,
9868,LETTER I,"THE DANE. Dhe grammatic Greek, my friend; ha! ha! Ha! (laughing, and"
9869,LETTER I,swinging my hand to and fro--then with a sudden transition to great
9870,LETTER I,"solemnity) Now I will tell you, my dear friend! Dhere did happen about"
9871,LETTER I,me vat de whole historia of Denmark record no instance about nobody
9872,LETTER I,else. Dhe bishop did ask me all dhe questions about all dhe religion in
9873,LETTER I,dhe Latin grammar.
9874,LETTER I,
9875,LETTER I,"ANSWER. The grammar, Sir? The language, I presume--"
9876,LETTER I,
9877,LETTER I,"THE DANE. (A little offended.) Grammar is language, and language is"
9878,LETTER I,grammar--
9879,LETTER I,
9880,LETTER I,ANSWER. Ten thousand pardons!
9881,LETTER I,
9882,LETTER I,"THE DANE. Vell, and I was only fourteen years--"
9883,LETTER I,
9884,LETTER I,ANSWER. Only fourteen years old?
9885,LETTER I,
9886,LETTER I,THE DANE. No more. I vas fourteen years old--and he asked me all
9887,LETTER I,"questions, religion and philosophy, and all in dhe Latin language--and I"
9888,LETTER I,"answered him all every one, my dear friend! all in dhe Latin language."
9889,LETTER I,
9890,LETTER I,ANSWER. A prodigy! an absolute prodigy!
9891,LETTER I,
9892,LETTER I,"THE DANE. No, no, no! he was a bishop, a great superintendent."
9893,LETTER I,
9894,LETTER I,ANSWER. Yes! a bishop.
9895,LETTER I,
9896,LETTER I,"THE DANE. A bishop--not a mere predicant, not a prediger."
9897,LETTER I,
9898,LETTER I,ANSWER. My dear Sir! we have misunderstood each other. I said that your
9899,LETTER I,"answering in Latin at so early an age was a prodigy, that is, a thing"
9900,LETTER I,that is wonderful; that does not often happen.
9901,LETTER I,
9902,LETTER I,THE DANE. Often! Dhere is not von instance recorded in dhe whole
9903,LETTER I,historia of Denmark.
9904,LETTER I,
9905,LETTER I,"ANSWER. And since then, Sir--?"
9906,LETTER I,
9907,LETTER I,"THE DANE. I was sent ofer to dhe Vest Indies--to our Island, and dhere I"
9908,LETTER I,had no more to do vid books. No! no! I put my genius anodher way--and
9909,LETTER I,"I haf made ten tousand pound a year. Is not dhat ghenius, my dear"
9910,LETTER I,friend?--But vat is money?--I dhink dhe poorest man alive my equal.
9911,LETTER I,"Yes, my dear friend; my little fortune is pleasant to my generous heart,"
9912,LETTER I,because I can do good--no man with so little a fortune ever did so much
9913,LETTER I,"generosity--no person--no man person, no woman person ever denies it."
9914,LETTER I,But we are all Got’s children.
9915,LETTER I,
9916,LETTER I,"Here the Hanoverian interrupted him, and the other Dane, the Swede, and"
9917,LETTER I,"the Prussian, joined us, together with a young Englishman who spoke the"
9918,LETTER I,"German fluently, and interpreted to me many of the Prussian’s jokes. The"
9919,LETTER I,"Prussian was a travelling merchant, turned of threescore, a hale"
9920,LETTER I,"man, tall, strong, and stout, full of stories, gesticulations, and"
9921,LETTER I,"buffoonery, with the soul as well as the look of a mountebank, who,"
9922,LETTER I,"while he is making you laugh, picks your pocket. Amid all his droll"
9923,LETTER I,"looks and droll gestures, there remained one look untouched by laughter;"
9924,LETTER I,"and that one look was the true face, the others were but its mask. The"
9925,LETTER I,"Hanoverian was a pale, fat, bloated young man, whose father had made a"
9926,LETTER I,"large fortune in London, as an army-contractor. He seemed to emulate"
9927,LETTER I,the manners of young Englishmen of fortune. He was a good-natured
9928,LETTER I,"fellow, not without information or literature; but a most egregious"
9929,LETTER I,"coxcomb. He had been in the habit of attending the House of Commons, and"
9930,LETTER I,"had once spoken, as he informed me, with great applause in a debating"
9931,LETTER I,society. For this he appeared to have qualified himself with laudable
9932,LETTER I,"industry: for he was perfect in Walker’s Pronouncing Dictionary, and"
9933,LETTER I,"with an accent, which forcibly reminded me of the Scotchman in Roderic"
9934,LETTER I,"Random, who professed to teach the English pronunciation, he was"
9935,LETTER I,"constantly deferring to my superior judgment, whether or no I had"
9936,LETTER I,"pronounced this or that word with propriety, or “the true delicacy.”"
9937,LETTER I,"When he spoke, though it were only half a dozen sentences, he always"
9938,LETTER I,"rose: for which I could detect no other motive, than his partiality"
9939,LETTER I,to that elegant phrase so liberally introduced in the orations of
9940,LETTER I,"our British legislators, “While I am on my legs.” The Swede, whom"
9941,LETTER I,"for reasons that will soon appear, I shall distinguish by the name"
9942,LETTER I,"of Nobility, was a strong-featured, scurvy-faced man, his complexion"
9943,LETTER I,"resembling in colour, a red hot poker beginning to cool. He appeared"
9944,LETTER I,"miserably dependent on the Dane; but was, however, incomparably the"
9945,LETTER I,best informed and most rational of the party. Indeed his manners
9946,LETTER I,and conversation discovered him to be both a man of the world and a
9947,LETTER I,gentleman. The Jew was in the hold: the French gentleman was lying on
9948,LETTER I,"the deck so ill, that I could observe nothing concerning him, except the"
9949,LETTER I,affectionate attentions of his servant to him. The poor fellow was very
9950,LETTER I,"sick himself, and every now and then ran to the side of the vessel,"
9951,LETTER I,"still keeping his eye on his master, but returned in a moment and seated"
9952,LETTER I,"himself again by him, now supporting his head, now wiping his forehead"
9953,LETTER I,and talking to him all the while in the most soothing tones. There
9954,LETTER I,"had been a matrimonial squabble of a very ludicrous kind in the cabin,"
9955,LETTER I,between the little German tailor and his little wife. He had secured two
9956,LETTER I,"beds, one for himself and one for her. This had struck the little woman"
9957,LETTER I,"as a very cruel action; she insisted upon their having but one, and"
9958,LETTER I,"assured the mate in the most piteous tones, that she was his lawful"
9959,LETTER I,"wife. The mate and the cabin boy decided in her favour, abused the"
9960,LETTER I,"little man for his want of tenderness with much humour, and hoisted"
9961,LETTER I,him into the same compartment with his sea-sick wife. This quarrel was
9962,LETTER I,"interesting to me, as it procured me a bed, which I otherwise should not"
9963,LETTER I,have had.
9964,LETTER I,
9965,LETTER I,"In the evening, at seven o’clock, the sea rolled higher, and the Dane,"
9966,LETTER I,"by means of the greater agitation, eliminated enough of what he had been"
9967,LETTER I,swallowing to make room for a great deal more. His favourite potation
9968,LETTER I,"was sugar and brandy, i.e. a very little warm water with a large"
9969,LETTER I,"quantity of brandy, sugar, and nutmeg His servant boy, a black-eyed"
9970,LETTER I,"Mulatto, had a good-natured round face, exactly the colour of the skin"
9971,LETTER I,"of the walnut-kernel. The Dane and I were again seated, tete-a-tete,"
9972,LETTER I,"in the ship’s boat. The conversation, which was now indeed rather an"
9973,LETTER I,"oration than a dialogue, became extravagant beyond all that I ever"
9974,LETTER I,heard. He told me that he had made a large fortune in the island of
9975,LETTER I,"Santa Cruz, and was now returning to Denmark to enjoy it. He expatiated"
9976,LETTER I,"on the style in which he meant to live, and the great undertakings which"
9977,LETTER I,"he proposed to himself to commence, till, the brandy aiding his vanity,"
9978,LETTER I,"and his vanity and garrulity aiding the brandy, he talked like a"
9979,LETTER I,madman--entreated me to accompany him to Denmark--there I should see his
9980,LETTER I,"influence with the government, and he would introduce me to the king,"
9981,LETTER I,"etc., etc. Thus he went on dreaming aloud, and then passing with a very"
9982,LETTER I,"lyrical transition to the subject of general politics, he declaimed,"
9983,LETTER I,"like a member of the Corresponding Society, about, (not concerning,)"
9984,LETTER I,"the Rights of Man, and assured me that, notwithstanding his fortune, he"
9985,LETTER I,"thought the poorest man alive his equal. “All are equal, my dear friend!"
9986,LETTER I,all are equal! Ve are all Got’s children. The poorest man haf the same
9987,LETTER I,rights with me. Jack! Jack! some more sugar and brandy. Dhere is dhat
9988,LETTER I,"fellow now! He is a Mulatto--but he is my equal.--That’s right, Jack!"
9989,LETTER I,(taking the sugar and brandy.) Here you Sir! shake hands with dhis
9990,LETTER I,"gentleman! Shake hands with me, you dog! Dhere, dhere!--We are all equal"
9991,LETTER I,"my dear friend! Do I not speak like Socrates, and Plato, and Cato--they"
9992,LETTER I,"were all philosophers, my dear philosophe! all very great men!--and so"
9993,LETTER I,"was Homer and Virgil--but they were poets. Yes, yes! I know all about"
9994,LETTER I,"it!--But what can anybody say more than this? We are all equal, all"
9995,LETTER I,"Got’s children. I haf ten tousand a year, but I am no more dhan de"
9996,LETTER I,"meanest man alive. I haf no pride; and yet, my dear friend! I can"
9997,LETTER I,"say, do! and it is done. Ha! ha! ha! my dear friend! Now dhere is dhat"
9998,LETTER I,gentleman (pointing to Nobility) he is a Swedish baron--you shall see.
9999,LETTER I,"Ho! (calling to the Swede) get me, will you, a bottle of wine from the"
10000,LETTER I,"cabin. SWEDE.--Here, Jack! go and get your master a bottle of wine from"
10001,LETTER I,"the cabin. DANE. No, no, no! do you go now--you go yourself you go now!"
10002,LETTER I,"SWEDE. Pah!--DANE. Now go! Go, I pray you.” And the Swede went!!"
10003,LETTER I,
10004,LETTER I,"After this the Dane commenced an harangue on religion, and mistaking"
10005,LETTER I,"me for un philosophe in the continental sense of the word, he talked of"
10006,LETTER I,"Deity in a declamatory style, very much resembling the devotional rants"
10007,LETTER I,"of that rude blunderer, Mr. Thomas Paine, in his Age of Reason, and"
10008,LETTER I,"whispered in my ear, what damned hypocrism all Jesus Christ’s business"
10009,LETTER I,"was. I dare aver, that few men have less reason to charge themselves"
10010,LETTER I,"with indulging in persiflage than myself. I should hate it, if it were"
10011,LETTER I,"only that it is a Frenchman’s vice, and feel a pride in avoiding it,"
10012,LETTER I,because our own language is too honest to have a word to express it by.
10013,LETTER I,"But in this instance the temptation had been too powerful, and I have"
10014,LETTER I,placed it on the list of my offences. Pericles answered one of his
10015,LETTER I,"dearest friends, who had solicited him on a case of life and death, to"
10016,LETTER I,"take an equivocal oath for his preservation: Debeo amicis opitulari, sed"
10017,LETTER I,usque ad Deos [75]. Friendship herself must place her last and boldest
10018,LETTER I,step on this side the altar. What Pericles would not do to save a
10019,LETTER I,"friend’s life, you may be assured, I would not hazard merely to mill the"
10020,LETTER I,chocolate-pot of a drunken fool’s vanity till it frothed over. Assuming
10021,LETTER I,"a serious look, I professed myself a believer, and sunk at once an"
10022,LETTER I,"hundred fathoms in his good graces. He retired to his cabin, and I"
10023,LETTER I,"wrapped myself up in my great coat, and looked at the water. A beautiful"
10024,LETTER I,white cloud of foam at momently intervals coursed by the side of the
10025,LETTER I,"vessel with a roar, and little stars of flame danced and sparkled and"
10026,LETTER I,went out in it: and every now and then light detachments of this white
10027,LETTER I,"cloud-like foam darted off from the vessel’s side, each with its own"
10028,LETTER I,"small constellation, over the sea, and scoured out of sight like a"
10029,LETTER I,Tartar troop over a wilderness.
10030,LETTER I,
10031,LETTER I,"It was cold, the cabin was at open war with my olfactories, and I found"
10032,LETTER I,"reason to rejoice in my great coat, a weighty high-caped, respectable"
10033,LETTER I,"rug, the collar of which turned over, and played the part of a night-cap"
10034,LETTER I,"very passably. In looking up at two or three bright stars, which"
10035,LETTER I,"oscillated with the motion of the sails, I fell asleep, but was awakened"
10036,LETTER I,"at one o’clock, Monday morning, by a shower of rain. I found myself"
10037,LETTER I,"compelled to go down into the cabin, where I slept very soundly, and"
10038,LETTER I,"awoke with a very good appetite at breakfast time, my nostrils, the most"
10039,LETTER I,"placable of all the senses, reconciled to, or indeed insensible of the"
10040,LETTER I,mephitis.
10041,LETTER I,
10042,LETTER I,"Monday, September 17th, I had a long conversation with the Swede, who"
10043,LETTER I,"spoke with the most poignant contempt of the Dane, whom he described as"
10044,LETTER I,"a fool, purse-mad; but he confirmed the boasts of the Dane respecting"
10045,LETTER I,"the largeness of his fortune, which he had acquired in the first"
10046,LETTER I,"instance as an advocate, and afterwards as a planter. From the Dane and"
10047,LETTER I,"from himself I collected that he was indeed a Swedish nobleman, who had"
10048,LETTER I,"squandered a fortune, that was never very large, and had made over his"
10049,LETTER I,"property to the Dane, on whom he was now utterly dependent. He seemed"
10050,LETTER I,to suffer very little pain from the Dane’s insolence. He was in a high
10051,LETTER I,"degree humane and attentive to the English lady, who suffered most"
10052,LETTER I,"fearfully, and for whom he performed many little offices with a"
10053,LETTER I,tenderness and delicacy which seemed to prove real goodness of heart.
10054,LETTER I,"Indeed his general manners and conversation were not only pleasing,"
10055,LETTER I,but even interesting; and I struggled to believe his insensibility
10056,LETTER I,respecting the Dane philosophical fortitude. For though the Dane was
10057,LETTER I,"now quite sober, his character oozed out of him at every pore. And after"
10058,LETTER I,"dinner, when he was again flushed with wine, every quarter of an hour or"
10059,LETTER I,"perhaps oftener he would shout out to the Swede, “Ho! Nobility, go--do"
10060,LETTER I,"such a thing! Mr. Nobility!--tell the gentlemen such a story, and"
10061,LETTER I,so forth;” with an insolence which must have excited disgust and
10062,LETTER I,"detestation, if his vulgar rants on the sacred rights of equality,"
10063,LETTER I,joined to his wild havoc of general grammar no less than of the English
10064,LETTER I,"language, had not rendered it so irresistibly laughable."
10065,LETTER I,
10066,LETTER I,"At four o’clock I observed a wild duck swimming on the waves, a single"
10067,LETTER I,"solitary wild duck. It is not easy to conceive, how interesting a thing"
10068,LETTER I,it looked in that round objectless desert of waters. I had associated
10069,LETTER I,"such a feeling of immensity with the ocean, that I felt exceedingly"
10070,LETTER I,"disappointed, when I was out of sight of all land, at the narrowness and"
10071,LETTER I,"nearness, as it were, of the circle of the horizon. So little are images"
10072,LETTER I,capable of satisfying the obscure feelings connected with words. In the
10073,LETTER I,"evening the sails were lowered, lest we should run foul of the land,"
10074,LETTER I,"which can be seen only at a small distance. And at four o’clock, on"
10075,LETTER I,"Tuesday morning, I was awakened by the cry of “land! land!” It was an"
10076,LETTER I,"ugly island rock at a distance on our left, called Heiligeland, well"
10077,LETTER I,"known to many passengers from Yarmouth to Hamburg, who have been obliged"
10078,LETTER I,"by stormy weather to pass weeks and weeks in weary captivity on it,"
10079,LETTER I,stripped of all their money by the exorbitant demands of the wretches
10080,LETTER I,who inhabit it. So at least the sailors informed me.--About nine o’clock
10081,LETTER I,"we saw the main land, which seemed scarcely able to hold its head above"
10082,LETTER I,"water, low, flat, and dreary, with lighthouses and land-marks which"
10083,LETTER I,seemed to give a character and language to the dreariness. We entered
10084,LETTER I,"the mouth of the Elbe, passing Neu-werk; though as yet the right bank"
10085,LETTER I,"only of the river was visible to us. On this I saw a church, and thanked"
10086,LETTER I,"God for my safe voyage, not without affectionate thoughts of those I"
10087,LETTER I,had left in England. At eleven o’clock on the same morning we arrived
10088,LETTER I,"at Cuxhaven, the ship dropped anchor, and the boat was hoisted out, to"
10089,LETTER I,carry the Hanoverian and a few others on shore. The captain agreed to
10090,LETTER I,"take us, who remained, to Hamburg for ten guineas, to which the Dane"
10091,LETTER I,"contributed so largely, that the other passengers paid but half a guinea"
10092,LETTER I,"each. Accordingly we hauled anchor, and passed gently up the river. At"
10093,LETTER I,Cuxhaven both sides of the river may be seen in clear weather; we could
10094,LETTER I,now see the right bank only. We passed a multitude of English traders
10095,LETTER I,that had been waiting many weeks for a wind. In a short time both banks
10096,LETTER I,"became visible, both flat and evidencing the labour of human hands by"
10097,LETTER I,their extreme neatness. On the left bank I saw a church or two in
10098,LETTER I,the distance; on the right bank we passed by steeple and windmill and
10099,LETTER I,"cottage, and windmill and single house, windmill and windmill, and neat"
10100,LETTER I,"single house, and steeple. These were the objects and in the succession."
10101,LETTER I,The shores were very green and planted with trees not inelegantly.
10102,LETTER I,"Thirty-five miles from Cuxhaven the night came on us, and, as the"
10103,LETTER I,"navigation of the Elbe is perilous, we dropped anchor."
10104,LETTER I,
10105,LETTER I,"Over what place, thought I, does the moon hang to your eye, my dearest"
10106,LETTER I,friend? To me it hung over the left bank of the Elbe. Close above the
10107,LETTER I,"moon was a huge volume of deep black cloud, while a very thin fillet"
10108,LETTER I,"crossed the middle of the orb, as narrow and thin and black as a ribbon"
10109,LETTER I,"of crape. The long trembling road of moonlight, which lay on the water"
10110,LETTER I,"and reached to the stern of our vessel, glimmered dimly and obscurely."
10111,LETTER I,"We saw two or three lights from the right bank, probably from bed-rooms."
10112,LETTER I,I felt the striking contrast between the silence of this majestic
10113,LETTER I,"stream, whose banks are populous with men and women and children, and"
10114,LETTER I,"flocks and herds--between the silence by night of this peopled river,"
10115,LETTER I,"and the ceaseless noise, and uproar, and loud agitations of the desolate"
10116,LETTER I,solitude of the ocean. The passengers below had all retired to their
10117,LETTER I,beds; and I felt the interest of this quiet scene the more deeply from
10118,LETTER I,the circumstance of having just quitted them. For the Prussian had
10119,LETTER I,during the whole of the evening displayed all his talents to captivate
10120,LETTER I,"the Dane, who had admitted him into the train of his dependents. The"
10121,LETTER I,young Englishman continued to interpret the Prussian’s jokes to me. They
10122,LETTER I,"were all without exception profane and abominable, but some sufficiently"
10123,LETTER I,"witty, and a few incidents, which he related in his own person, were"
10124,LETTER I,valuable as illustrating the manners of the countries in which they had
10125,LETTER I,taken place.
10126,LETTER I,
10127,LETTER I,"Five o’clock on Wednesday morning we hauled the anchor, but were soon"
10128,LETTER I,"obliged to drop it again in consequence of a thick fog, which our"
10129,LETTER I,captain feared would continue the whole day; but about nine it cleared
10130,LETTER I,"off, and we sailed slowly along, close by the shore of a very beautiful"
10131,LETTER I,"island, forty miles from Cuxhaven, the wind continuing slack. This"
10132,LETTER I,"holm or island is about a mile and a half in length, wedge-shaped,"
10133,LETTER I,"well wooded, with glades of the liveliest green, and rendered more"
10134,LETTER I,interesting by the remarkably neat farm-house on it. It seemed made for
10135,LETTER I,"retirement without solitude--a place that would allure one’s friends,"
10136,LETTER I,while it precluded the impertinent calls of mere visitors. The shores of
10137,LETTER I,"the Elbe now became more beautiful, with rich meadows and trees running"
10138,LETTER I,"like a low wall along the river’s edge; and peering over them,"
10139,LETTER I,"neat houses and, (especially on the right bank,) a profusion of"
10140,LETTER I,"steeple-spires, white, black, or red. An instinctive taste teaches men"
10141,LETTER I,"to build their churches in flat countries with spire-steeples, which,"
10142,LETTER I,"as they cannot be referred to any other object, point, as with silent"
10143,LETTER I,"finger, to the sky and stars, and sometimes, when they reflect the"
10144,LETTER I,"brazen light of a rich though rainy sun-set, appear like a pyramid of"
10145,LETTER I,"flame burning heavenward. I remember once, and once only, to have seen"
10146,LETTER I,a spire in a narrow valley of a mountainous country. The effect was
10147,LETTER I,"not only mean but ludicrous, and reminded me against my will of an"
10148,LETTER I,"extinguisher; the close neighbourhood of the high mountain, at the foot"
10149,LETTER I,"of which it stood, had so completely dwarfed it, and deprived it of"
10150,LETTER I,all connection with the sky or clouds. Forty-six English miles from
10151,LETTER I,"Cuxhaven, and sixteen from Hamburg, the Danish village Veder ornaments"
10152,LETTER I,"the left bank with its black steeple, and close by it is the wild and"
10153,LETTER I,"pastoral hamlet of Schulau. Hitherto both the right and left bank, green"
10154,LETTER I,"to the very brink, and level with the river, resembled the shores of a"
10155,LETTER I,"park canal. The trees and houses were alike low, sometimes the low trees"
10156,LETTER I,"over-topping the yet lower houses, sometimes the low houses rising"
10157,LETTER I,above the yet lower trees. But at Schulau the left bank rises at once
10158,LETTER I,"forty or fifty feet, and stares on the river with its perpendicular"
10159,LETTER I,"facade of sand, thinly patched with tufts of green. The Elbe continued"
10160,LETTER I,to present a more and more lively spectacle from the multitude of
10161,LETTER I,"fishing boats and the flocks of sea gulls wheeling round them, the"
10162,LETTER I,clamorous rivals and companions of the fishermen; till we came to
10163,LETTER I,"Blankaness, a most interesting village scattered amid scattered trees,"
10164,LETTER I,over three hills in three divisions. Each of the three hills stares upon
10165,LETTER I,"the river, with faces of bare sand, with which the boats with their"
10166,LETTER I,"bare poles, standing in files along the banks, made a sort of fantastic"
10167,LETTER I,"harmony. Between each facade lies a green and woody dell, each deeper"
10168,LETTER I,than the other. In short it is a large village made up of individual
10169,LETTER I,"cottages, each cottage in the centre of its own little wood or orchard,"
10170,LETTER I,and each with its own separate path: a village with a labyrinth of
10171,LETTER I,"paths, or rather a neighbourhood of houses! It is inhabited by fishermen"
10172,LETTER I,"and boat-makers, the Blankanese boats being in great request through the"
10173,LETTER I,"whole navigation of the Elbe. Here first we saw the spires of Hamburg,"
10174,LETTER I,"and from hence, as far as Altona, the left bank of the Elbe is"
10175,LETTER I,"uncommonly pleasing, considered as the vicinity of an industrious and"
10176,LETTER I,"republican city--in that style of beauty, or rather prettiness, that"
10177,LETTER I,"might tempt the citizen into the country, and yet gratify the taste"
10178,LETTER I,which he had acquired in the town. Summer-houses and Chinese show-work
10179,LETTER I,are everywhere scattered along the high and green banks; the boards
10180,LETTER I,of the farm-houses left unplastered and gaily painted with green and
10181,LETTER I,yellow; and scarcely a tree not cut into shapes and made to remind the
10182,LETTER I,human being of his own power and intelligence instead of the wisdom of
10183,LETTER I,"nature. Still, however, these are links of connection between town and"
10184,LETTER I,"country, and far better than the affectation of tastes and enjoyments"
10185,LETTER I,for which men’s habits have disqualified them. Pass them by on Saturdays
10186,LETTER I,"and Sundays with the burghers of Hamburg smoking their pipes, the women"
10187,LETTER I,"and children feasting in the alcoves of box and yew, and it becomes a"
10188,LETTER I,"nature of its own. On Wednesday, four o’clock, we left the vessel, and"
10189,LETTER I,passing with trouble through the huge masses of shipping that seemed to
10190,LETTER I,"choke the wide Elbe from Altona upward, we were at length landed at the"
10191,LETTER I,"Boom House, Hamburg."

10199,LETTER II,
10200,RATZEBURG.,RATZEBURG.
10201,RATZEBURG.,
10202,RATZEBURG.,"Meine liebe Freundinn,"
10203,RATZEBURG.,
10204,RATZEBURG.,"See how natural the German comes from me, though I have not yet"
10205,RATZEBURG.,been six weeks in the country!--almost as fluently as English from my
10206,RATZEBURG.,"neighbour the Amtsschreiber, (or public secretary,) who as often as"
10207,RATZEBURG.,"we meet, though it should be half a dozen times in the same day,"
10208,RATZEBURG.,"never fails to greet me with--“---ddam your ploot unt eyes, my"
10209,RATZEBURG.,dearest Englander! vhee goes it!”--which is certainly a proof of great
10210,RATZEBURG.,"generosity on his part, these words being his whole stock of English."
10211,RATZEBURG.,"I had, however, a better reason than the desire of displaying my"
10212,RATZEBURG.,"proficiency: for I wished to put you in good humour with a language,"
10213,RATZEBURG.,from the acquirement of which I have promised myself much edification
10214,RATZEBURG.,and the means too of communicating a new pleasure to you and your
10215,RATZEBURG.,"sister, during our winter readings. And how can I do this better than"
10216,RATZEBURG.,"by pointing out its gallant attention to the ladies? Our English affix,"
10217,RATZEBURG.,"ess, is, I believe, confined either to words derived from the Latin, as"
10218,RATZEBURG.,"actress, directress, etc., or from the French, as mistress, duchess, and"
10219,RATZEBURG.,"the like. But the German, inn, enables us to designate the sex in"
10220,RATZEBURG.,every possible relation of life. Thus the Amtmann’s lady is the Frau
10221,RATZEBURG.,"Amtmanninn--the secretary’s wife, (by the bye, the handsomest"
10222,RATZEBURG.,"woman I have yet seen in Germany,) is die allerliebste Frau"
10223,RATZEBURG.,"Amtsschreiberinn--the colonel’s lady, die Frau Obristinn or"
10224,RATZEBURG.,"Colonellinn--and even the parson’s wife, die Frau Pastorinn. But I am"
10225,RATZEBURG.,"especially pleased with their Freundinn, which, unlike the amica of the"
10226,RATZEBURG.,"Romans, is seldom used but in its best and purest sense. Now, I know"
10227,RATZEBURG.,"it will be said, that a friend is already something more than a friend,"
10228,RATZEBURG.,when a man feels an anxiety to express to himself that this friend is a
10229,RATZEBURG.,female; but this I deny--in that sense at least in which the objection
10230,RATZEBURG.,"will be made. I would hazard the impeachment of heresy, rather than"
10231,RATZEBURG.,abandon my belief that there is a sex in our souls as well as in their
10232,RATZEBURG.,"perishable garments; and he who does not feel it, never truly loved a"
10233,RATZEBURG.,"sister--nay, is not capable even of loving a wife as she deserves to be"
10234,RATZEBURG.,"loved, if she indeed be worthy of that holy name."
10235,RATZEBURG.,
10236,RATZEBURG.,"Now I know, my gentle friend, what you are murmuring to yourself--“This"
10237,RATZEBURG.,"is so like him! running away after the first bubble, that chance has"
10238,RATZEBURG.,blown off from the surface of his fancy; when one is anxious to learn
10239,RATZEBURG.,where he is and what he has seen.” Well then! that I am settled at
10240,RATZEBURG.,"Ratzeburg, with my motives and the particulars of my journey hither,"
10241,RATZEBURG.,"will inform you. My first letter to him, with which doubtless he has"
10242,RATZEBURG.,"edified your whole fireside, left me safely landed at Hamburg on the"
10243,RATZEBURG.,"Elbe Stairs, at the Boom House. While standing on the stairs, I was"
10244,RATZEBURG.,amused by the contents of the passage-boat which crosses the river once
10245,RATZEBURG.,or twice a day from Hamburg to Haarburg. It was stowed close with all
10246,RATZEBURG.,"people of all nations, in all sorts of dresses; the men all with pipes"
10247,RATZEBURG.,"in their mouths, and these pipes of all shapes and fancies--straight"
10248,RATZEBURG.,"and wreathed, simple and complex, long and short, cane, clay, porcelain,"
10249,RATZEBURG.,"wood, tin, silver, and ivory; most of them with silver chains and silver"
10250,RATZEBURG.,bole-covers. Pipes and boots are the first universal characteristic of
10251,RATZEBURG.,the male Hamburgers that would strike the eye of a raw traveller. But
10252,RATZEBURG.,"I forget my promise of journalizing as much as possible.--Therefore,"
10253,RATZEBURG.,"Septr. 19th Afternoon. My companion, who, you recollect, speaks"
10254,RATZEBURG.,"the French language with unusual propriety, had formed a kind of"
10255,RATZEBURG.,"confidential acquaintance with the emigrant, who appeared to be a man"
10256,RATZEBURG.,"of sense, and whose manners were those of a perfect gentleman. He seemed"
10257,RATZEBURG.,about fifty or rather more. Whatever is unpleasant in French manners
10258,RATZEBURG.,"from excess in the degree, had been softened down by age or affliction;"
10259,RATZEBURG.,"and all that is delightful in the kind, alacrity and delicacy in little"
10260,RATZEBURG.,"attentions, etc., remained, and without bustle, gesticulation,"
10261,RATZEBURG.,or disproportionate eagerness. His demeanour exhibited the minute
10262,RATZEBURG.,"philanthropy of a polished Frenchman, tempered by the sobriety of"
10263,RATZEBURG.,the English character disunited from its reserve. There is something
10264,RATZEBURG.,strangely attractive in the character of a gentleman when you apply the
10265,RATZEBURG.,"word emphatically, and yet in that sense of the term which it is more"
10266,RATZEBURG.,easy to feel than to define. It neither includes the possession of high
10267,RATZEBURG.,"moral excellence, nor of necessity even the ornamental graces of manner."
10268,RATZEBURG.,I have now in my mind’s eye a person whose life would scarcely stand
10269,RATZEBURG.,"scrutiny even in the court of honour, much less in that of conscience;"
10270,RATZEBURG.,"and his manners, if nicely observed, would of the two excite an idea"
10271,RATZEBURG.,of awkwardness rather than of elegance: and yet every one who conversed
10272,RATZEBURG.,"with him felt and acknowledged the gentleman. The secret of the matter,"
10273,RATZEBURG.,"I believe to be this--we feel the gentlemanly character present to us,"
10274,RATZEBURG.,"whenever, under all the circumstances of social intercourse, the trivial"
10275,RATZEBURG.,"not less than the important, through the whole detail of his manners"
10276,RATZEBURG.,"and deportment, and with the ease of a habit, a person shows respect to"
10277,RATZEBURG.,"others in such a way, as at the same time implies in his own feelings"
10278,RATZEBURG.,an habitual and assured anticipation of reciprocal respect from them to
10279,RATZEBURG.,"himself. In short, the gentlemanly character arises out of the feeling"
10280,RATZEBURG.,"of Equality acting, as a Habit, yet flexible to the varieties of"
10281,RATZEBURG.,"Rank, and modified without being disturbed or superseded by them. This"
10282,RATZEBURG.,description will perhaps explain to you the ground of one of your own
10283,RATZEBURG.,"remarks, as I was englishing to you the interesting dialogue concerning"
10284,RATZEBURG.,the causes of the corruption of eloquence. “What perfect gentlemen these
10285,RATZEBURG.,"old Romans must have been! I was impressed, I remember, with the"
10286,RATZEBURG.,same feeling at the time I was reading a translation of Cicero’s
10287,RATZEBURG.,philosophical dialogues and of his epistolary correspondence: while in
10288,RATZEBURG.,Pliny’s Letters I seemed to have a different feeling--he gave me the
10289,RATZEBURG.,notion of a very fine gentleman.” You uttered the words as if you had
10290,RATZEBURG.,felt that the adjunct had injured the substance and the increased degree
10291,RATZEBURG.,altered the kind. Pliny was the courtier of an absolute monarch--Cicero
10292,RATZEBURG.,"an aristocratic republican. For this reason the character of gentleman,"
10293,RATZEBURG.,"in the sense to which I have confined it, is frequent in England, rare"
10294,RATZEBURG.,"in France, and found, where it is found, in age or the latest period"
10295,RATZEBURG.,of manhood; while in Germany the character is almost unknown. But
10296,RATZEBURG.,the proper antipode of a gentleman is to be sought for among the
10297,RATZEBURG.,Anglo-American democrats.
10298,RATZEBURG.,
10299,RATZEBURG.,"I owe this digression, as an act of justice to this amiable Frenchman,"
10300,RATZEBURG.,and of humiliation for myself. For in a little controversy between us
10301,RATZEBURG.,"on the subject of French poetry, he made me feel my own ill behaviour by"
10302,RATZEBURG.,"the silent reproof of contrast, and when I afterwards apologized to him"
10303,RATZEBURG.,"for the warmth of my language, he answered me with a cheerful expression"
10304,RATZEBURG.,"of surprise, and an immediate compliment, which a gentleman might both"
10305,RATZEBURG.,make with dignity and receive with pleasure. I was pleased therefore to
10306,RATZEBURG.,"find it agreed on, that we should, if possible, take up our quarters in"
10307,RATZEBURG.,"the same house. My friend went with him in search of an hotel, and I to"
10308,RATZEBURG.,deliver my letters of recommendation.
10309,RATZEBURG.,
10310,RATZEBURG.,"I walked onward at a brisk pace, enlivened not so much by anything I"
10311,RATZEBURG.,"actually saw, as by the confused sense that I was for the first time"
10312,RATZEBURG.,in my life on the continent of our planet. I seemed to myself like a
10313,RATZEBURG.,"liberated bird that had been hatched in an aviary, who now, after his"
10314,RATZEBURG.,"first soar of freedom, poises himself in the upper air. Very naturally I"
10315,RATZEBURG.,"began to wonder at all things, some for being so like and some for being"
10316,RATZEBURG.,so unlike the things in England--Dutch women with large umbrella hats
10317,RATZEBURG.,"shooting out half a yard before them, with a prodigal plumpness of"
10318,RATZEBURG.,petticoat behind--the women of Hamburg with caps plaited on the caul
10319,RATZEBURG.,"with silver, or gold, or both, bordered round with stiffened lace, which"
10320,RATZEBURG.,"stood out before their eyes, but not lower, so that the eyes sparkled"
10321,RATZEBURG.,"through it--the Hanoverian with the fore part of the head bare, then a"
10322,RATZEBURG.,"stiff lace standing up like a wall perpendicular on the cap, and the cap"
10323,RATZEBURG.,behind tailed with an enormous quantity of ribbon which lies or tosses
10324,RATZEBURG.,on the back:
10325,RATZEBURG.,
10326,RATZEBURG.,“Their visnomies seem’d like a goodly banner
10327,RATZEBURG.,Spread in defiance of all enemies.”
10328,RATZEBURG.,
10329,RATZEBURG.,"The ladies all in English dresses, all rouged, and all with bad teeth:"
10330,RATZEBURG.,"which you notice instantly from their contrast to the almost animal, too"
10331,RATZEBURG.,glossy mother-of-pearl whiteness and the regularity of the teeth of the
10332,RATZEBURG.,"laughing, loud-talking country-women and servant-girls, who with their"
10333,RATZEBURG.,"clean white stockings and with slippers without heel quarters, tripped"
10334,RATZEBURG.,"along the dirty streets, as if they were secured by a charm from"
10335,RATZEBURG.,"the dirt: with a lightness too, which surprised me, who had always"
10336,RATZEBURG.,"considered it as one of the annoyances of sleeping in an Inn, that I"
10337,RATZEBURG.,had to clatter up stairs in a pair of them. The streets narrow; to my
10338,RATZEBURG.,"English nose sufficiently offensive, and explaining at first sight"
10339,RATZEBURG.,the universal use of boots; without any appropriate path for the
10340,RATZEBURG.,"foot-passengers; the gable ends of the houses all towards the street,"
10341,RATZEBURG.,some in the ordinary triangular form and entire as the botanists say;
10342,RATZEBURG.,but the greater number notched and scolloped with more than Chinese
10343,RATZEBURG.,"grotesqueness. Above all, I was struck with the profusion of windows,"
10344,RATZEBURG.,"so large and so many, that the houses look all glass. Mr. Pitt’s window"
10345,RATZEBURG.,"tax, with its pretty little additionals sprouting out from it like young"
10346,RATZEBURG.,"toadlets on the back of a Surinam toad, would certainly improve the"
10347,RATZEBURG.,"appearance of the Hamburg houses, which have a slight summer look, not"
10348,RATZEBURG.,"in keeping with their size, incongruous with the climate, and precluding"
10349,RATZEBURG.,"that feeling of retirement and self-content, which one wishes to"
10350,RATZEBURG.,"associate with a house in a noisy city. But a conflagration would, I"
10351,RATZEBURG.,"fear, be the previous requisite to the production of any architectural"
10352,RATZEBURG.,beauty in Hamburg: for verily it is a filthy town. I moved on and
10353,RATZEBURG.,"crossed a multitude of ugly bridges, with huge black deformities of"
10354,RATZEBURG.,"water wheels close by them. The water intersects the city everywhere,"
10355,RATZEBURG.,and would have furnished to the genius of Italy the capabilities of all
10356,RATZEBURG.,that is most beautiful and magnificent in architecture. It might have
10357,RATZEBURG.,"been the rival of Venice, and it is huddle and ugliness, stench and"
10358,RATZEBURG.,"stagnation. The Jungfer Stieg, (that is, Young Ladies’ Walk), to which"
10359,RATZEBURG.,"my letters directed me, made an exception. It was a walk or promenade"
10360,RATZEBURG.,"planted with treble rows of elm trees, which, being yearly pruned and"
10361,RATZEBURG.,"cropped, remain slim and dwarf-like. This walk occupies one side of a"
10362,RATZEBURG.,"square piece of water, with many swans on it perfectly tame, and, moving"
10363,RATZEBURG.,"among the swans, shewy pleasure-boats with ladies in them, rowed by"
10364,RATZEBURG.,their husbands or lovers.------
10365,RATZEBURG.,
10366,RATZEBURG.,(Some paragraphs have been here omitted.)------thus embarrassed by sad
10367,RATZEBURG.,"and solemn politeness still more than by broken English, it sounded like"
10368,RATZEBURG.,the voice of an old friend when I heard the emigrant’s servant inquiring
10369,RATZEBURG.,after me. He had come for the purpose of guiding me to our hotel.
10370,RATZEBURG.,"Through streets and streets I pressed on as happy as a child, and, I"
10371,RATZEBURG.,"doubt not, with a childish expression of wonderment in my busy eyes,"
10372,RATZEBURG.,"amused by the wicker waggons with movable benches across them, one"
10373,RATZEBURG.,"behind the other, (these were the hackney coaches;) amused by the"
10374,RATZEBURG.,"sign-boards of the shops, on which all the articles sold within are"
10375,RATZEBURG.,"painted, and that too very exactly, though in a grotesque confusion, (a"
10376,RATZEBURG.,useful substitute for language in this great mart of nations;) amused
10377,RATZEBURG.,"with the incessant tinkling of the shop and house door bells, the"
10378,RATZEBURG.,bell hanging over each door and struck with a small iron rod at every
10379,RATZEBURG.,"entrance and exit;--and finally, amused by looking in at the windows,"
10380,RATZEBURG.,as I passed along; the ladies and gentlemen drinking coffee or playing
10381,RATZEBURG.,"cards, and the gentlemen all smoking. I wished myself a painter, that I"
10382,RATZEBURG.,might have sent you a sketch of one of the card parties. The long pipe
10383,RATZEBURG.,"of one gentleman rested on the table, its bole half a yard from his"
10384,RATZEBURG.,"mouth, fuming like a censer by the fish-pool--the other gentleman, who"
10385,RATZEBURG.,"was dealing the cards, and of course had both hands employed, held his"
10386,RATZEBURG.,"pipe in his teeth, which hanging down between his knees, smoked beside"
10387,RATZEBURG.,his ancles. Hogarth himself never drew a more ludicrous distortion both
10388,RATZEBURG.,"of attitude and physiognomy, than this effort occasioned nor was there"
10389,RATZEBURG.,wanting beside it one of those beautiful female faces which the same
10390,RATZEBURG.,"Hogarth, in whom the satirist never extinguished that love of beauty"
10391,RATZEBURG.,"which belonged to him as a poet, so often and so gladly introduces, as"
10392,RATZEBURG.,"the central figure, in a crowd of humorous deformities, which figures,"
10393,RATZEBURG.,"(such is the power of true genius!) neither acts, nor is meant to act"
10394,RATZEBURG.,"as a contrast; but diffuses through all, and over each of the group,"
10395,RATZEBURG.,"a spirit of reconciliation and human kindness; and, even when the"
10396,RATZEBURG.,attention is no longer consciously directed to the cause of this
10397,RATZEBURG.,"feeling, still blends its tenderness with our laughter: and thus"
10398,RATZEBURG.,prevents the instructive merriment at the whims of nature or the foibles
10399,RATZEBURG.,or humours of our fellow-men from degenerating into the heart-poison of
10400,RATZEBURG.,contempt or hatred.
10401,RATZEBURG.,
10402,RATZEBURG.,"Our hotel DIE WILDE MAN, (the sign of which was no bad likeness of the"
10403,RATZEBURG.,"landlord, who had ingrafted on a very grim face a restless grin, that"
10404,RATZEBURG.,"was at every man’s service, and which indeed, like an actor rehearsing"
10405,RATZEBURG.,"to himself, he kept playing in expectation of an occasion for"
10406,RATZEBURG.,"it)--neither our hotel, I say, nor its landlord were of the genteelest"
10407,RATZEBURG.,"class. But it has one great advantage for a stranger, by being in the"
10408,RATZEBURG.,"market place, and the next neighbour of the huge church of St. Nicholas:"
10409,RATZEBURG.,"a church with shops and houses built up against it, out of which wens"
10410,RATZEBURG.,"and warts its high massy steeple rises, necklaced near the top with a"
10411,RATZEBURG.,round of large gilt balls. A better pole-star could scarcely be desired.
10412,RATZEBURG.,"Long shall I retain the impression made on my mind by the awful echo,"
10413,RATZEBURG.,"so loud and long and tremulous, of the deep-toned clock within this"
10414,RATZEBURG.,"church, which awoke me at two in the morning from a distressful dream,"
10415,RATZEBURG.,"occasioned, I believe, by the feather bed, which is used here instead"
10416,RATZEBURG.,of bed-clothes. I will rather carry my blanket about with me like a wild
10417,RATZEBURG.,"Indian, than submit to this abominable custom. Our emigrant acquaintance"
10418,RATZEBURG.,"was, we found, an intimate friend of the celebrated Abbe de Lisle:"
10419,RATZEBURG.,"and from the large fortune which he possessed under the monarchy, had"
10420,RATZEBURG.,"rescued sufficient not only for independence, but for respectability. He"
10421,RATZEBURG.,"had offended some of his fellow-emigrants in London, whom he had obliged"
10422,RATZEBURG.,"with considerable sums, by a refusal to make further advances, and"
10423,RATZEBURG.,in consequence of their intrigues had received an order to quit the
10424,RATZEBURG.,"kingdom. I thought it one proof of his innocence, that he attached no"
10425,RATZEBURG.,"blame either to the alien act, or to the minister who had exerted it"
10426,RATZEBURG.,"against him; and a still greater, that he spoke of London with rapture,"
10427,RATZEBURG.,"and of his favourite niece, who had married and settled in England, with"
10428,RATZEBURG.,all the fervour and all the pride of a fond parent. A man sent by force
10429,RATZEBURG.,"out of a country, obliged to sell out of the stocks at a great loss, and"
10430,RATZEBURG.,exiled from those pleasures and that style of society which habit had
10431,RATZEBURG.,"rendered essential to his happiness, whose predominant feelings were yet"
10432,RATZEBURG.,"all of a private nature, resentment for friendship outraged, and anguish"
10433,RATZEBURG.,"for domestic affections interrupted--such a man, I think, I could dare"
10434,RATZEBURG.,"warrant guiltless of espionnage in any service, most of all in that of"
10435,RATZEBURG.,the present French Directory. He spoke with ecstasy of Paris under the
10436,RATZEBURG.,"Monarchy: and yet the particular facts, which made up his description,"
10437,RATZEBURG.,"left as deep a conviction on my mind, of French worthlessness, as his"
10438,RATZEBURG.,own tale had done of emigrant ingratitude. Since my arrival in
10439,RATZEBURG.,"Germany, I have not met a single person, even among those who abhor"
10440,RATZEBURG.,"the Revolution, that spoke with favour, or even charity of the French"
10441,RATZEBURG.,emigrants. Though the belief of their influence in the organization
10442,RATZEBURG.,"of this disastrous war (from the horrors of which, North Germany deems"
10443,RATZEBURG.,"itself only reprieved, not secured,) may have some share in the general"
10444,RATZEBURG.,aversion with which they are regarded: yet I am deeply persuaded
10445,RATZEBURG.,"that the far greater part is owing to their own profligacy, to their"
10446,RATZEBURG.,"treachery and hardheartedness to each other, and the domestic misery or"
10447,RATZEBURG.,corrupt principles which so many of them have carried into the families
10448,RATZEBURG.,"of their protectors. My heart dilated with honest pride, as I recalled"
10449,RATZEBURG.,"to mind the stern yet amiable characters of the English patriots, who"
10450,RATZEBURG.,sought refuge on the Continent at the Restoration! O let not our civil
10451,RATZEBURG.,war under the first Charles be paralleled with the French Revolution!
10452,RATZEBURG.,"In the former, the character overflowed from excess of principle; in the"
10453,RATZEBURG.,"latter from the fermentation of the dregs! The former, was a civil war"
10454,RATZEBURG.,between the virtues and virtuous prejudices of the two parties; the
10455,RATZEBURG.,"latter, between the vices. The Venetian glass of the French monarchy"
10456,RATZEBURG.,shivered and flew asunder with the working of a double poison.
10457,RATZEBURG.,
10458,RATZEBURG.,"Sept. 20th. I was introduced to Mr. Klopstock, the brother of the poet,"
10459,RATZEBURG.,"who again introduced me to Professor Ebeling, an intelligent and lively"
10460,RATZEBURG.,"man, though deaf: so deaf, indeed, that it was a painful effort to talk"
10461,RATZEBURG.,"with him, as we were obliged to drop our pearls into a huge ear-trumpet."
10462,RATZEBURG.,"From this courteous and kind-hearted man of letters, (I hope, the"
10463,RATZEBURG.,"German literati in general may resemble this first specimen), I heard a"
10464,RATZEBURG.,"tolerable Italian pun, and an interesting anecdote. When Buonaparte was"
10465,RATZEBURG.,"in Italy, having been irritated by some instance of perfidy, he said in"
10466,RATZEBURG.,"a loud and vehement tone, in a public company--“’tis a true proverb, gli"
10467,RATZEBURG.,"Italiani tutti ladroni”--(that is, the Italians all plunderers.) A lady"
10468,RATZEBURG.,"had the courage to reply, “Non tutti; ma BUONA PARTE,” (not all, but a"
10469,RATZEBURG.,"good part, or Buonaparte.) This, I confess, sounded to my ears, as one"
10470,RATZEBURG.,of the many good things that might have been said. The anecdote is more
10471,RATZEBURG.,valuable; for it instances the ways and means of French insinuation.
10472,RATZEBURG.,Hoche had received much information concerning the face of the country
10473,RATZEBURG.,"from a map of unusual fulness and accuracy, the maker of which, he"
10474,RATZEBURG.,"heard, resided at Duesseldorf. At the storming of Duesseldorf by the"
10475,RATZEBURG.,"French army, Hoche previously ordered, that the house and property of"
10476,RATZEBURG.,"this man should be preserved, and intrusted the performance of the order"
10477,RATZEBURG.,"to an officer on whose troop he could rely. Finding afterwards, that the"
10478,RATZEBURG.,"man had escaped before the storming commenced, Hoche exclaimed, “HE had"
10479,RATZEBURG.,"no reason to flee! It is for such men, not against them, that the French"
10480,RATZEBURG.,"nation makes war, and consents to shed the blood of its children.” You"
10481,RATZEBURG.,remember Milton’s sonnet--
10482,RATZEBURG.,
10483,RATZEBURG.,“The great Emathian conqueror bid spare
10484,RATZEBURG.,The house of Pindarus when temple and tower
10485,RATZEBURG.,Went to the ground”------
10486,RATZEBURG.,
10487,RATZEBURG.,Now though the Duesseldorf map-maker may stand in the same relation to
10488,RATZEBURG.,"the Theban bard, as the snail, that marks its path by lines of film on"
10489,RATZEBURG.,"the wall it creeps over, to the eagle that soars sunward and beats the"
10490,RATZEBURG.,"tempest with its wings; it does not therefore follow, that the Jacobin"
10491,RATZEBURG.,"of France may not be as valiant a general and as good a politician, as"
10492,RATZEBURG.,the madman of Macedon.
10493,RATZEBURG.,
10494,RATZEBURG.,From Professor Ebeling’s Mr. Klopstock accompanied my friend and me
10495,RATZEBURG.,"to his own house, where I saw a fine bust of his brother. There was a"
10496,RATZEBURG.,"solemn and heavy greatness in his countenance, which corresponded to my"
10497,RATZEBURG.,"preconceptions of his style and genius.--I saw there, likewise, a very"
10498,RATZEBURG.,"fine portrait of Lessing, whose works are at present the chief object of"
10499,RATZEBURG.,"my admiration. His eyes were uncommonly like mine, if anything, rather"
10500,RATZEBURG.,larger and more prominent. But the lower part of his face and his
10501,RATZEBURG.,nose--O what an exquisite expression of elegance and sensibility!--There
10502,RATZEBURG.,"appeared no depth, weight, or comprehensiveness in the forehead.--The"
10503,RATZEBURG.,"whole face seemed to say, that Lessing was a man of quick and voluptuous"
10504,RATZEBURG.,feelings; of an active but light fancy; acute; yet acute not in the
10505,RATZEBURG.,"observation of actual life, but in the arrangements and management of"
10506,RATZEBURG.,"the ideal world, that is, in taste, and in metaphysics. I assure you,"
10507,RATZEBURG.,that I wrote these very words in my memorandum-book with the portrait
10508,RATZEBURG.,"before my eyes, and when I knew nothing of Lessing but his name, and"
10509,RATZEBURG.,that he was a German writer of eminence.
10510,RATZEBURG.,
10511,RATZEBURG.,"We consumed two hours and more over a bad dinner, at the table d’hote."
10512,RATZEBURG.,"“Patience at a German ordinary, smiling at time.” The Germans are the"
10513,RATZEBURG.,worst cooks in Europe. There is placed for every two persons a bottle
10514,RATZEBURG.,of common wine--Rhenish and Claret alternately; but in the houses of the
10515,RATZEBURG.,"opulent, during the many and long intervals of the dinner, the servants"
10516,RATZEBURG.,hand round glasses of richer wines. At the Lord of Culpin’s they came
10517,RATZEBURG.,in this order. Burgundy--Madeira--Port--Frontiniac--Pacchiaretti--Old
10518,RATZEBURG.,"Hock--Mountain--Champagne--Hock again--Bishop, and lastly, Punch. A"
10519,RATZEBURG.,"tolerable quantum, methinks! The last dish at the ordinary, viz. slices"
10520,RATZEBURG.,"of roast pork, (for all the larger dishes are brought in, cut up, and"
10521,RATZEBURG.,"first handed round and then set on the table,) with stewed prunes and"
10522,RATZEBURG.,"other sweet fruits, and this followed by cheese and butter, with plates"
10523,RATZEBURG.,"of apples, reminded me of Shakespeare [76], and Shakespeare put it in my"
10524,RATZEBURG.,head to go to the French comedy.
10525,RATZEBURG.,
10526,RATZEBURG.,Bless me! why it is worse than our modern English plays! The first act
10527,RATZEBURG.,"informed me, that a court martial is to be held on a Count Vatron, who"
10528,RATZEBURG.,"had drawn his sword on the Colonel, his brother-in-law. The officers"
10529,RATZEBURG.,"plead in his behalf--in vain! His wife, the Colonel’s sister, pleads"
10530,RATZEBURG.,with most tempestuous agonies--in vain! She falls into hysterics and
10531,RATZEBURG.,"faints away, to the dropping of the inner curtain! In the second act"
10532,RATZEBURG.,"sentence of death is passed on the Count--his wife, as frantic and"
10533,RATZEBURG.,hysterical as before: more so (good industrious creature!) she could
10534,RATZEBURG.,"not be. The third and last act, the wife still frantic, very frantic"
10535,RATZEBURG.,"indeed!--the soldiers just about to fire, the handkerchief actually"
10536,RATZEBURG.,dropped; when reprieve! reprieve! is heard from behind the scenes:
10537,RATZEBURG.,"and in comes Prince Somebody, pardons the Count, and the wife is still"
10538,RATZEBURG.,"frantic, only with joy; that was all!"
10539,RATZEBURG.,
10540,RATZEBURG.,"O dear lady! this is one of the cases, in which laughter is followed"
10541,RATZEBURG.,"by melancholy: for such is the kind of drama, which is now substituted"
10542,RATZEBURG.,"every where for Shakespeare and Racine. You well know, that I offer"
10543,RATZEBURG.,violence to my own feelings in joining these names. But however meanly
10544,RATZEBURG.,"I may think of the French serious drama, even in its most perfect"
10545,RATZEBURG.,specimens; and with whatever right I may complain of its perpetual
10546,RATZEBURG.,"falsification of the language, and of the connections and transitions"
10547,RATZEBURG.,"of thought, which Nature has appropriated to states of passion; still,"
10548,RATZEBURG.,"however, the French tragedies are consistent works of art, and the"
10549,RATZEBURG.,offspring of great intellectual power. Preserving a fitness in the
10550,RATZEBURG.,"parts, and a harmony in the whole, they form a nature of their own,"
10551,RATZEBURG.,though a false nature. Still they excite the minds of the spectators to
10552,RATZEBURG.,"active thought, to a striving after ideal excellence. The soul is not"
10553,RATZEBURG.,stupefied into mere sensations by a worthless sympathy with our
10554,RATZEBURG.,"own ordinary sufferings, or an empty curiosity for the surprising,"
10555,RATZEBURG.,undignified by the language or the situations which awe and delight the
10556,RATZEBURG.,"imagination. What, (I would ask of the crowd, that press forward to"
10557,RATZEBURG.,the pantomimic tragedies and weeping comedies of Kotzebue and his
10558,RATZEBURG.,"imitators), what are you seeking? Is it comedy? But in the comedy of"
10559,RATZEBURG.,"Shakespeare and Moliere the more accurate my knowledge, and the more"
10560,RATZEBURG.,"profoundly I think, the greater is the satisfaction that mingles with"
10561,RATZEBURG.,my laughter. For though the qualities which these writers pourtray are
10562,RATZEBURG.,"ludicrous indeed, either from the kind or the excess, and exquisitely"
10563,RATZEBURG.,"ludicrous, yet are they the natural growth of the human mind and such"
10564,RATZEBURG.,"as, with more or less change in the drapery, I can apply to my own"
10565,RATZEBURG.,"heart, or at least to whole classes of my fellow-creatures. How often"
10566,RATZEBURG.,are not the moralist and the metaphysician obliged for the happiest
10567,RATZEBURG.,illustrations of general truths and the subordinate laws of human
10568,RATZEBURG.,"thought and action to quotations, not only from the tragic characters,"
10569,RATZEBURG.,"but equally from the Jaques, Falstaff, and even from the fools and"
10570,RATZEBURG.,"clowns of Shakespeare, or from the Miser, Hypochondriast, and Hypocrite,"
10571,RATZEBURG.,"of Moliere! Say not, that I am recommending abstractions: for these"
10572,RATZEBURG.,"class-characteristics, which constitute the instructiveness of a"
10573,RATZEBURG.,"character, are so modified and particularized in each person of the"
10574,RATZEBURG.,"Shakesperian Drama, that life itself does not excite more distinctly"
10575,RATZEBURG.,that sense of individuality which belongs to real existence. Paradoxical
10576,RATZEBURG.,"as it may sound, one of the essential properties of geometry is not"
10577,RATZEBURG.,"less essential to dramatic excellence, and, (if I may mention his name"
10578,RATZEBURG.,"without pedantry to a lady,) Aristotle has accordingly required of"
10579,RATZEBURG.,the poet an involution of the universal in the individual. The chief
10580,RATZEBURG.,"differences are, that in geometry it is the universal truth itself,"
10581,RATZEBURG.,"which is uppermost in the consciousness, in poetry the individual form"
10582,RATZEBURG.,"in which the truth is clothed. With the ancients, and not less with the"
10583,RATZEBURG.,"elder dramatists of England and France, both comedy and tragedy were"
10584,RATZEBURG.,considered as kinds of poetry. They neither sought in comedy to make
10585,RATZEBURG.,"us laugh merely, much less to make us laugh by wry faces, accidents of"
10586,RATZEBURG.,"jargon, slang phrases for the day, or the clothing of commonplace morals"
10587,RATZEBURG.,in metaphors drawn from the shops or mechanic occupations of their
10588,RATZEBURG.,characters; nor did they condescend in tragedy to wheedle away the
10589,RATZEBURG.,"applause of the spectators, by representing before them fac-similes"
10590,RATZEBURG.,"of their own mean selves in all their existing meanness, or to work on"
10591,RATZEBURG.,their sluggish sympathies by a pathos not a whit more respectable than
10592,RATZEBURG.,the maudlin tears of drunkenness. Their tragic scenes were meant to
10593,RATZEBURG.,"affect us indeed, but within the bounds of pleasure, and in union with"
10594,RATZEBURG.,the activity both of our understanding and imagination. They wished to
10595,RATZEBURG.,"transport the mind to a sense of its possible greatness, and to implant"
10596,RATZEBURG.,the germs of that greatness during the temporary oblivion of the
10597,RATZEBURG.,"worthless “thing, we are” and of the peculiar state, in which each man"
10598,RATZEBURG.,happens to be; suspending our individual recollections and lulling them
10599,RATZEBURG.,to sleep amid the music of nobler thoughts.
10600,RATZEBURG.,
10601,RATZEBURG.,"Hold!--(methinks I hear the spokesman of the crowd reply, and we will"
10602,RATZEBURG.,"listen to him. I am the plaintiff, and he the defendant.)"
10603,RATZEBURG.,
10604,RATZEBURG.,DEFENDANT. Hold! are not our modern sentimental plays filled with the
10605,RATZEBURG.,best Christian morality?
10606,RATZEBURG.,
10607,RATZEBURG.,"PLAINTIFF. Yes! just as much of it, and just that part of it, which"
10608,RATZEBURG.,you can exercise without a single Christian virtue--without a single
10609,RATZEBURG.,"sacrifice that is really painful to you!--just as much as flatters you,"
10610,RATZEBURG.,"sends you away pleased with your own hearts, and quite reconciled to"
10611,RATZEBURG.,"your vices, which can never be thought very ill of, when they keep"
10612,RATZEBURG.,"such good company, and walk hand in hand with so much compassion and"
10613,RATZEBURG.,"generosity; adulation so loathsome, that you would spit in the man’s"
10614,RATZEBURG.,"face who dared offer it to you in a private company, unless you"
10615,RATZEBURG.,"interpreted it as insulting irony, you appropriate with infinite"
10616,RATZEBURG.,"satisfaction, when you share the garbage with the whole stye, and gobble"
10617,RATZEBURG.,"it out of a common trough. No Caesar must pace your boards--no Antony,"
10618,RATZEBURG.,"no royal Dane, no Orestes, no Andromache!"
10619,RATZEBURG.,
10620,RATZEBURG.,D. No: or as few of them as possible. What has a plain citizen of
10621,RATZEBURG.,"London, or Hamburg, to do with your kings and queens, and your old"
10622,RATZEBURG.,"school-boy Pagan heroes? Besides, every body knows the stories; and what"
10623,RATZEBURG.,curiosity can we feel----
10624,RATZEBURG.,
10625,RATZEBURG.,"P. What, Sir, not for the manner?--not for the delightful language"
10626,RATZEBURG.,"of the poet?--not for the situations, the action and reaction of the"
10627,RATZEBURG.,passions?
10628,RATZEBURG.,
10629,RATZEBURG.,"D. You are hasty, Sir! the only curiosity, we feel, is in the story: and"
10630,RATZEBURG.,"how can we be anxious concerning the end of a play, or be surprised by"
10631,RATZEBURG.,"it, when we know how it will turn out?"
10632,RATZEBURG.,
10633,RATZEBURG.,"P. Your pardon, for having interrupted you! we now understand each"
10634,RATZEBURG.,"other. You seek then, in a tragedy, which wise men of old held for the"
10635,RATZEBURG.,"highest effort of human genius, the same gratification, as that you"
10636,RATZEBURG.,"receive from a new novel, the last German romance, and other dainties of"
10637,RATZEBURG.,"the day, which can be enjoyed but once. If you carry these feelings to"
10638,RATZEBURG.,"the sister art of Painting, Michael Angelo’s Sixtine Chapel, and the"
10639,RATZEBURG.,Scripture Gallery of Raphael can expect no favour from you. You know
10640,RATZEBURG.,"all about them beforehand; and are, doubtless, more familiar with the"
10641,RATZEBURG.,"subjects of those paintings, than with the tragic tales of the historic"
10642,RATZEBURG.,"or heroic ages. There is a consistency, therefore, in your preference of"
10643,RATZEBURG.,"contemporary writers: for the great men of former times, those at least"
10644,RATZEBURG.,"who were deemed great by our ancestors, sought so little to gratify this"
10645,RATZEBURG.,"kind of curiosity, that they seemed to have regarded the story in a not"
10646,RATZEBURG.,"much higher light, than the painter regards his canvass: as that on, not"
10647,RATZEBURG.,"by, which they were to display their appropriate excellence. No work,"
10648,RATZEBURG.,"resembling a tale or romance, can well show less variety of invention"
10649,RATZEBURG.,"in the incidents, or less anxiety in weaving them together, than the DON"
10650,RATZEBURG.,QUIXOTE of Cervantes. Its admirers feel the disposition to go back and
10651,RATZEBURG.,"re-peruse some preceding chapter, at least ten times for once that they"
10652,RATZEBURG.,find any eagerness to hurry forwards: or open the book on those parts
10653,RATZEBURG.,"which they best recollect, even as we visit those friends oftenest whom"
10654,RATZEBURG.,"we love most, and with whose characters and actions we are the most"
10655,RATZEBURG.,"intimately acquainted. In the divine Ariosto, (as his countrymen call"
10656,RATZEBURG.,"this, their darling poet,) I question whether there be a single tale of"
10657,RATZEBURG.,"his own invention, or the elements of which, were not familiar to the"
10658,RATZEBURG.,"readers of “old romance.” I will pass by the ancient Greeks, who thought"
10659,RATZEBURG.,"it even necessary to the fable of a tragedy, that its substance should"
10660,RATZEBURG.,be previously known. That there had been at least fifty tragedies with
10661,RATZEBURG.,"the same title, would be one of the motives which determined Sophocles"
10662,RATZEBURG.,"and Euripides, in the choice of Electra as a subject. But Milton--"
10663,RATZEBURG.,
10664,RATZEBURG.,"D. Aye Milton, indeed!--but do not Dr. Johnson and other great men tell"
10665,RATZEBURG.,"us, that nobody now reads Milton but as a task?"
10666,RATZEBURG.,
10667,RATZEBURG.,"P. So much the worse for them, of whom this can be truly said! But why"
10668,RATZEBURG.,"then do you pretend to admire Shakespeare? The greater part, if not"
10669,RATZEBURG.,"all, of his dramas were, as far as the names and the main incidents are"
10670,RATZEBURG.,"concerned, already stock plays. All the stories, at least, on which they"
10671,RATZEBURG.,"are built, pre-existed in the chronicles, ballads, or translations of"
10672,RATZEBURG.,"contemporary or preceding English writers. Why, I repeat, do you pretend"
10673,RATZEBURG.,"to admire Shakespeare? Is it, perhaps, that you only pretend to admire"
10674,RATZEBURG.,"him? However, as once for all, you have dismissed the well-known events"
10675,RATZEBURG.,"and personages of history, or the epic muse, what have you taken in"
10676,RATZEBURG.,their stead? Whom has your tragic muse armed with her bowl and dagger?
10677,RATZEBURG.,"the sentimental muse I should have said, whom you have seated in the"
10678,RATZEBURG.,throne of tragedy? What heroes has she reared on her buskins?
10679,RATZEBURG.,
10680,RATZEBURG.,"D. O! our good friends and next-door neighbours--honest tradesmen,"
10681,RATZEBURG.,"valiant tars, high-spirited half-pay officers, philanthropic Jews,"
10682,RATZEBURG.,"virtuous courtezans, tender-hearted braziers, and sentimental"
10683,RATZEBURG.,"rat-catchers!--(a little bluff or so, but all our very generous,"
10684,RATZEBURG.,"tender-hearted characters are a little rude or misanthropic, and all"
10685,RATZEBURG.,our misanthropes very tender-hearted.)
10686,RATZEBURG.,
10687,RATZEBURG.,"P. But I pray you, friend, in what actions great or interesting, can"
10688,RATZEBURG.,such men be engaged?
10689,RATZEBURG.,
10690,RATZEBURG.,D. They give away a great deal of money; find rich dowries for young
10691,RATZEBURG.,men and maidens who have all other good qualities; they brow-beat
10692,RATZEBURG.,"lords, baronets, and justices of the peace, (for they are as bold as"
10693,RATZEBURG.,Hector!)--they rescue stage coaches at the instant they are falling down
10694,RATZEBURG.,precipices; carry away infants in the sight of opposing armies; and some
10695,RATZEBURG.,"of our performers act a muscular able-bodied man to such perfection,"
10696,RATZEBURG.,"that our dramatic poets, who always have the actors in their eye, seldom"
10697,RATZEBURG.,fail to make their favourite male character as strong as Samson. And
10698,RATZEBURG.,then they take such prodigious leaps!! And what is done on the stage is
10699,RATZEBURG.,more striking even than what is acted. I once remember such a deafening
10700,RATZEBURG.,"explosion, that I could not hear a word of the play for half an act"
10701,RATZEBURG.,after it: and a little real gunpowder being set fire to at the same
10702,RATZEBURG.,"time, and smelt by all the spectators, the naturalness of the scene was"
10703,RATZEBURG.,quite astonishing!
10704,RATZEBURG.,
10705,RATZEBURG.,P. But how can you connect with such men and such actions that
10706,RATZEBURG.,"dependence of thousands on the fate of one, which gives so lofty an"
10707,RATZEBURG.,"interest to the personages of Shakespeare, and the Greek Tragedians? How"
10708,RATZEBURG.,"can you connect with them that sublimest of all feelings, the power of"
10709,RATZEBURG.,"destiny and the controlling might of heaven, which seems to elevate the"
10710,RATZEBURG.,characters which sink beneath its irresistible blow?
10711,RATZEBURG.,
10712,RATZEBURG.,D. O mere fancies! We seek and find on the present stage our own wants
10713,RATZEBURG.,"and passions, our own vexations, losses, and embarrassments."
10714,RATZEBURG.,
10715,RATZEBURG.,"P. It is your own poor pettifogging nature then, which you desire to"
10716,RATZEBURG.,have represented before you?--not human nature in its height and vigour?
10717,RATZEBURG.,"But surely you might find the former with all its joys and sorrows, more"
10718,RATZEBURG.,conveniently in your own houses and parishes.
10719,RATZEBURG.,
10720,RATZEBURG.,"D. True! but here comes a difference. Fortune is blind, but the poet has"
10721,RATZEBURG.,"his eyes open, and is besides as complaisant as fortune is capricious."
10722,RATZEBURG.,He makes every thing turn out exactly as we would wish it. He gratifies
10723,RATZEBURG.,us by representing those as hateful or contemptible whom we hate and
10724,RATZEBURG.,wish to despise.
10725,RATZEBURG.,
10726,RATZEBURG.,"P. (aside.) That is, he gratifies your envy by libelling your superiors."
10727,RATZEBURG.,
10728,RATZEBURG.,"D. He makes all those precise moralists, who affect to be better than"
10729,RATZEBURG.,"their neighbours, turn out at last abject hypocrites, traitors, and"
10730,RATZEBURG.,"hard-hearted villains; and your men of spirit, who take their girl and"
10731,RATZEBURG.,"their glass with equal freedom, prove the true men of honour, and, (that"
10732,RATZEBURG.,"no part of the audience may remain unsatisfied,) reform in the last"
10733,RATZEBURG.,"scene, and leave no doubt in the minds of the ladies, that they will"
10734,RATZEBURG.,"make most faithful and excellent husbands: though it does seem a pity,"
10735,RATZEBURG.,that they should be obliged to get rid of qualities which had made them
10736,RATZEBURG.,"so interesting! Besides, the poor become rich all at once; and in the"
10737,RATZEBURG.,final matrimonial choice the opulent and high-born themselves are made
10738,RATZEBURG.,"to confess; that VIRTUE IS THE ONLY TRUE NOBILITY, AND THAT A LOVELY"

10773,RATZEBURG.,RATZEBURG.
10774,RATZEBURG.,"No little fish thrown back again into the water, no fly unimprisoned"
10775,RATZEBURG.,"from a child’s hand, could more buoyantly enjoy its element, than I this"
10776,RATZEBURG.,"clean and peaceful house, with this lovely view of the town, groves,"
10777,RATZEBURG.,"and lake of Ratzeburg, from the window at which I am writing. My spirits"
10778,RATZEBURG.,"certainly, and my health I fancied, were beginning to sink under the"
10779,RATZEBURG.,"noise, dirt, and unwholesome air of our Hamburg hotel. I left it"
10780,RATZEBURG.,"on Sunday, Sept. 23rd, with a letter of introduction from the poet"
10781,RATZEBURG.,"Klopstock, to the Amtmann of Ratzeburg. The Amtmann received me with"
10782,RATZEBURG.,"kindness, and introduced me to the worthy pastor, who agreed to board"
10783,RATZEBURG.,"and lodge me for any length of time not less than a month. The vehicle,"
10784,RATZEBURG.,"in which I took my place, was considerably larger than an English"
10785,RATZEBURG.,"stage-coach, to which it bore much the same proportion and rude"
10786,RATZEBURG.,"resemblance, that an elephant’s ear does to the human. Its top was"
10787,RATZEBURG.,"composed of naked boards of different colours, and seeming to have been"
10788,RATZEBURG.,parts of different wainscots. Instead of windows there were leathern
10789,RATZEBURG.,curtains with a little eye of glass in each: they perfectly answered
10790,RATZEBURG.,the purpose of keeping out the prospect and letting in the cold. I
10791,RATZEBURG.,"could observe little therefore, but the inns and farmhouses at which"
10792,RATZEBURG.,"we stopped. They were all alike, except in size: one great room, like"
10793,RATZEBURG.,"a barn, with a hay-loft over it, the straw and hay dangling in tufts"
10794,RATZEBURG.,"through the boards which formed the ceiling of the room, and the floor"
10795,RATZEBURG.,"of the loft. From this room, which is paved like a street, sometimes"
10796,RATZEBURG.,"one, sometimes two smaller ones, are enclosed at one end. These are"
10797,RATZEBURG.,"commonly floored. In the large room the cattle, pigs, poultry, men,"
10798,RATZEBURG.,"women, and children, live in amicable community; yet there was an"
10799,RATZEBURG.,appearance of cleanliness and rustic comfort. One of these houses I
10800,RATZEBURG.,measured. It was an hundred feet in length. The apartments were taken
10801,RATZEBURG.,off from one corner. Between these and the stalls there was a small
10802,RATZEBURG.,"interspace, and here the breadth was forty-eight feet, but thirty-two"
10803,RATZEBURG.,"where the stalls were; of course, the stalls were on each side eight"
10804,RATZEBURG.,"feet in depth. The faces of the cows, etc. were turned towards the room;"
10805,RATZEBURG.,"indeed they were in it, so that they had at least the comfort of seeing"
10806,RATZEBURG.,"each other’s faces. Stall-feeding is universal in this part of Germany,"
10807,RATZEBURG.,a practice concerning which the agriculturist and the poet are likely
10808,RATZEBURG.,"to entertain opposite opinions--or at least, to have very different"
10809,RATZEBURG.,feelings. The woodwork of these buildings on the outside is left
10810,RATZEBURG.,"unplastered, as in old houses among us, and, being painted red and"
10811,RATZEBURG.,"green, it cuts and tesselates the buildings very gaily. From within"
10812,RATZEBURG.,"three miles of Hamburg almost to Molln, which is thirty miles from it,"
10813,RATZEBURG.,"the country, as far as I could see it, was a dead flat, only varied by"
10814,RATZEBURG.,woods. At Molln it became more beautiful. I observed a small lake nearly
10815,RATZEBURG.,"surrounded with groves, and a palace in view belonging to the King of"
10816,RATZEBURG.,"Great Britain, and inhabited by the Inspector of the Forests. We were"
10817,RATZEBURG.,nearly the same time in travelling the thirty-five miles from Hamburg to
10818,RATZEBURG.,"Ratzeburg, as we had been in going from London to Yarmouth, one hundred"
10819,RATZEBURG.,and twenty-six miles.
10820,RATZEBURG.,
10821,RATZEBURG.,"The lake of Ratzeburg runs from south to north, about nine miles in"
10822,RATZEBURG.,"length, and varying in breadth from three miles to half a mile. About a"
10823,RATZEBURG.,"mile from the southernmost point it is divided into two, of course very"
10824,RATZEBURG.,"unequal, parts by an island, which, being connected by a bridge and a"
10825,RATZEBURG.,"narrow slip of land with the one shore, and by another bridge of immense"
10826,RATZEBURG.,"length with the other shore, forms a complete isthmus. On this island"
10827,RATZEBURG.,"the town of Ratzeburg is built. The pastor’s house or vicarage, together"
10828,RATZEBURG.,"with the Amtmann’s Amtsschreiber’s, and the church, stands near the"
10829,RATZEBURG.,"summit of a hill, which slopes down to the slip of land and the little"
10830,RATZEBURG.,"bridge, from which, through a superb military gate, you step into"
10831,RATZEBURG.,"the island-town of Ratzeburg. This again is itself a little hill, by"
10832,RATZEBURG.,"ascending and descending which, you arrive at the long bridge, and so to"
10833,RATZEBURG.,the other shore. The water to the south of the town is called the Little
10834,RATZEBURG.,"Lake, which however almost engrosses the beauties of the whole the"
10835,RATZEBURG.,shores being just often enough green and bare to give the proper
10836,RATZEBURG.,effect to the magnificent groves which occupy the greater part of their
10837,RATZEBURG.,"circumference. From the turnings, windings, and indentations of the"
10838,RATZEBURG.,"shore, the views vary almost every ten steps, and the whole has a sort"
10839,RATZEBURG.,"of majestic beauty, a feminine grandeur. At the north of the Great Lake,"
10840,RATZEBURG.,"and peeping over it, I see the seven church towers of Luebec, at the"
10841,RATZEBURG.,"distance of twelve or thirteen miles, yet as distinctly as if they"
10842,RATZEBURG.,"were not three. The only defect in the view is, that Ratzeburg is built"
10843,RATZEBURG.,"entirely of red bricks, and all the houses roofed with red tiles. To the"
10844,RATZEBURG.,"eye, therefore, it presents a clump of brick-dust red. Yet this evening,"
10845,RATZEBURG.,"Oct. 10th, twenty minutes past five, I saw the town perfectly beautiful,"
10846,RATZEBURG.,"and the whole softened down into complete keeping, if I may borrow a"
10847,RATZEBURG.,term from the painters. The sky over Ratzeburg and all the east was a
10848,RATZEBURG.,"pure evening blue, while over the west it was covered with light sandy"
10849,RATZEBURG.,"clouds. Hence a deep red light spread over the whole prospect, in"
10850,RATZEBURG.,"undisturbed harmony with the red town, the brown-red woods, and the"
10851,RATZEBURG.,"yellow-red reeds on the skirts of the lake. Two or three boats, with"
10852,RATZEBURG.,"single persons paddling them, floated up and down in the rich light,"
10853,RATZEBURG.,"which not only was itself in harmony with all, but brought all into"
10854,RATZEBURG.,harmony.
10855,RATZEBURG.,
10856,RATZEBURG.,I should have told you that I went back to Hamburg on Thursday (Sept.
10857,RATZEBURG.,"27th) to take leave of my friend, who travels southward, and returned"
10858,RATZEBURG.,"hither on the Monday following. From Empfelde, a village half way from"
10859,RATZEBURG.,"Ratzeburg, I walked to Hamburg through deep sandy roads and a dreary"
10860,RATZEBURG.,"flat: the soil everywhere white, hungry, and excessively pulverised; but"
10861,RATZEBURG.,"the approach to the city is pleasing. Light cool country houses, which"
10862,RATZEBURG.,"you can look through and see the gardens behind them, with arbours and"
10863,RATZEBURG.,"trellis work, and thick vegetable walls, and trees in cloisters and"
10864,RATZEBURG.,"piazzas, each house with neat rails before it, and green seats within"
10865,RATZEBURG.,"the rails. Every object, whether the growth of nature or the work of"
10866,RATZEBURG.,"man, was neat and artificial. It pleased me far better, than if the"
10867,RATZEBURG.,"houses and gardens, and pleasure fields, had been in a nobler taste:"
10868,RATZEBURG.,"for this nobler taste would have been mere apery. The busy, anxious,"
10869,RATZEBURG.,"money-loving merchant of Hamburg could only have adopted, he could not"
10870,RATZEBURG.,have enjoyed the simplicity of nature. The mind begins to love nature by
10871,RATZEBURG.,"imitating human conveniences in nature; but this is a step in intellect,"
10872,RATZEBURG.,"though a low one--and were it not so, yet all around me spoke"
10873,RATZEBURG.,"of innocent enjoyment and sensitive comforts, and I entered with"
10874,RATZEBURG.,unscrupulous sympathy into the enjoyments and comforts even of the
10875,RATZEBURG.,"busy, anxious, money-loving merchants of Hamburg. In this charitable and"
10876,RATZEBURG.,catholic mood I reached the vast ramparts of the city. These are huge
10877,RATZEBURG.,"green cushions, one rising above the other, with trees growing in the"
10878,RATZEBURG.,"interspaces, pledges and symbols of a long peace. Of my return I have"
10879,RATZEBURG.,"nothing worth communicating, except that I took extra post, which"
10880,RATZEBURG.,answers to posting in England. These north German post chaises are
10881,RATZEBURG.,"uncovered wicker carts. An English dust-cart is a piece of finery, a"
10882,RATZEBURG.,"chef d’auvre of mechanism, compared with them and the horses!--a savage"
10883,RATZEBURG.,might use their ribs instead of his fingers for a numeration table.
10884,RATZEBURG.,"Wherever we stopped, the postilion fed his cattle with the brown rye"
10885,RATZEBURG.,"bread of which he eat himself, all breakfasting together; only the"
10886,RATZEBURG.,"horses had no gin to their water, and the postilion no water to his gin."
10887,RATZEBURG.,"Now and henceforward for subjects of more interest to you, and to"
10888,RATZEBURG.,"the objects in search of which I left you: namely, the literati and"
10889,RATZEBURG.,literature of Germany.
10890,RATZEBURG.,
10891,RATZEBURG.,"Believe me, I walked with an impression of awe on my spirits, as"
10892,RATZEBURG.,"W----and myself accompanied Mr. Klopstock to the house of his brother,"
10893,RATZEBURG.,"the poet, which stands about a quarter of a mile from the city gate."
10894,RATZEBURG.,"It is one of a row of little common-place summer-houses, (for so they"
10895,RATZEBURG.,"looked,) with four or five rows of young meagre elm trees before the"
10896,RATZEBURG.,"windows, beyond which is a green, and then a dead flat intersected with"
10897,RATZEBURG.,"several roads. Whatever beauty, (thought I,) may be before the poet’s"
10898,RATZEBURG.,"eyes at present, it must certainly be purely of his own creation. We"
10899,RATZEBURG.,"waited a few minutes in a neat little parlour, ornamented with the"
10900,RATZEBURG.,"figures of two of the Muses and with prints, the subjects of which were"
10901,RATZEBURG.,from Klopstock’s odes. The poet entered. I was much disappointed in his
10902,RATZEBURG.,"countenance, and recognised in it no likeness to the bust. There was"
10903,RATZEBURG.,"no comprehension in the forehead, no weight over the eye-brows, no"
10904,RATZEBURG.,"expression of peculiarity, moral or intellectual, on the eyes, no"
10905,RATZEBURG.,"massiveness in the general countenance. He is, if anything, rather below"
10906,RATZEBURG.,"the middle size. He wore very large half-boots, which his legs filled,"
10907,RATZEBURG.,"so fearfully were they swollen. However, though neither W---- nor"
10908,RATZEBURG.,myself could discover any indications of sublimity or enthusiasm in his
10909,RATZEBURG.,"physiognomy, we were both equally impressed with his liveliness, and his"
10910,RATZEBURG.,"kind and ready courtesy. He talked in French with my friend, and with"
10911,RATZEBURG.,difficulty spoke a few sentences to me in English. His enunciation was
10912,RATZEBURG.,not in the least affected by the entire want of his upper teeth. The
10913,RATZEBURG.,conversation began on his part by the expression of his rapture at the
10914,RATZEBURG.,surrender of the detachment of French troops under General Humbert.
10915,RATZEBURG.,Their proceedings in Ireland with regard to the committee which they
10916,RATZEBURG.,"had appointed, with the rest of their organizing system, seemed to have"
10917,RATZEBURG.,given the poet great entertainment. He then declared his sanguine belief
10918,RATZEBURG.,"in Nelson’s victory, and anticipated its confirmation with a keen and"
10919,RATZEBURG.,"triumphant pleasure. His words, tones, looks, implied the most vehement"
10920,RATZEBURG.,"Anti-Gallicanism. The subject changed to literature, and I inquired"
10921,RATZEBURG.,in Latin concerning the history of German poetry and the elder German
10922,RATZEBURG.,"poets. To my great astonishment he confessed, that he knew very little"
10923,RATZEBURG.,on the subject. He had indeed occasionally read one or two of their
10924,RATZEBURG.,"elder writers, but not so as to enable him to speak of their merits."
10925,RATZEBURG.,"Professor Ebeling, he said, would probably give me every information of"
10926,RATZEBURG.,this kind: the subject had not particularly excited his curiosity.
10927,RATZEBURG.,"He then talked of Milton and Glover, and thought Glover’s blank verse"
10928,RATZEBURG.,superior to Milton’s. W---- and myself expressed our surprise: and
10929,RATZEBURG.,"my friend gave his definition and notion of harmonious verse, that"
10930,RATZEBURG.,"it consisted, (the English iambic blank verse above all,) in the apt"
10931,RATZEBURG.,"arrangement of pauses and cadences, and the sweep of whole paragraphs,"
10932,RATZEBURG.,
10933,RATZEBURG.,“with many a winding bout
10934,RATZEBURG.,"Of linked sweetness long drawn out,”"
10935,RATZEBURG.,
10936,RATZEBURG.,"and not in the even flow, much less in the prominence of antithetic"
10937,RATZEBURG.,"vigour, of single lines, which were indeed injurious to the total"
10938,RATZEBURG.,"effect, except where they were introduced for some specific purpose."
10939,RATZEBURG.,"Klopstock assented, and said that he meant to confine Glover’s"
10940,RATZEBURG.,"superiority to single lines. He told us that he had read Milton, in"
10941,RATZEBURG.,"a prose translation, when he was fourteen [77]. I understood him thus"
10942,RATZEBURG.,"myself, and W---- interpreted Klopstock’s French as I had already"
10943,RATZEBURG.,construed it. He appeared to know very little of Milton or indeed of our
10944,RATZEBURG.,poets in general. He spoke with great indignation of the English prose
10945,RATZEBURG.,"translation of his MESSIAH. All the translations had been bad, very"
10946,RATZEBURG.,bad--but the English was no translation--there were pages on pages
10947,RATZEBURG.,not in the original--and half the original was not to be found in the
10948,RATZEBURG.,translation. W---- told him that I intended to translate a few of his
10949,RATZEBURG.,"odes as specimens of German lyrics--he then said to me in English, “I"
10950,RATZEBURG.,"wish you would render into English some select passages of THE MESSIAH,"
10951,RATZEBURG.,and revenge me of your countryman!”. It was the liveliest thing which he
10952,RATZEBURG.,"produced in the whole conversation. He told us, that his first ode was"
10953,RATZEBURG.,fifty years older than his last. I looked at him with much emotion--I
10954,RATZEBURG.,considered him as the venerable father of German poetry; as a good man;
10955,RATZEBURG.,as a Christian; seventy-four years old; with legs enormously swollen;
10956,RATZEBURG.,"yet active, lively, cheerful, and kind, and communicative. My eyes felt"
10957,RATZEBURG.,as if a tear were swelling into them. In the portrait of Lessing
10958,RATZEBURG.,"there was a toupee periwig, which enormously injured the effect of his"
10959,RATZEBURG.,"physiognomy--Klopstock wore the same, powdered and frizzled. By the"
10960,RATZEBURG.,"bye, old men ought never to wear powder--the contrast between a large"
10961,RATZEBURG.,"snow-white wig and the colour of an old man’s skin is disgusting, and"
10962,RATZEBURG.,wrinkles in such a neighbourhood appear only channels for dirt. It is
10963,RATZEBURG.,"an honour to poets and great men, that you think of them as parts of"
10964,RATZEBURG.,"nature; and anything of trick and fashion wounds you in them, as much as"
10965,RATZEBURG.,when you see venerable yews clipped into miserable peacocks.--The author
10966,RATZEBURG.,of THE MESSIAH should have worn his own grey hair.--His powder and
10967,RATZEBURG.,periwig were to the eye what Mr. Virgil would be to the ear.
10968,RATZEBURG.,
10969,RATZEBURG.,Klopstock dwelt much on the superior power which the German language
10970,RATZEBURG.,"possessed of concentrating meaning. He said, he had often translated"
10971,RATZEBURG.,"parts of Homer and Virgil, line by line, and a German line proved always"
10972,RATZEBURG.,sufficient for a Greek or Latin one. In English you cannot do this. I
10973,RATZEBURG.,"answered, that in English we could commonly render one Greek heroic line"
10974,RATZEBURG.,"in a line and a half of our common heroic metre, and I conjectured that"
10975,RATZEBURG.,this line and a half would be found to contain no more syllables than
10976,RATZEBURG.,"one German or Greek hexameter. He did not understand me [78]: and I, who"
10977,RATZEBURG.,"wished to hear his opinions, not to correct them, was glad that he did"
10978,RATZEBURG.,not.
10979,RATZEBURG.,
10980,RATZEBURG.,We now took our leave. At the beginning of the French Revolution
10981,RATZEBURG.,Klopstock wrote odes of congratulation. He received some honorary
10982,RATZEBURG.,"presents from the French Republic, (a golden crown I believe), and,"
10983,RATZEBURG.,"like our Priestley, was invited to a seat in the legislature, which he"
10984,RATZEBURG.,"declined. But when French liberty metamorphosed herself into a fury, he"
10985,RATZEBURG.,"sent back these presents with a palinodia, declaring his abhorrence of"
10986,RATZEBURG.,their proceedings: and since then he has been perhaps more than enough
10987,RATZEBURG.,"an Anti-Gallican. I mean, that in his just contempt and detestation"
10988,RATZEBURG.,"of the crimes and follies of the Revolutionists, he suffers himself to"
10989,RATZEBURG.,forget that the revolution itself is a process of the Divine Providence;
10990,RATZEBURG.,"and that as the folly of men is the wisdom of God, so are their"
10991,RATZEBURG.,iniquities instruments of his goodness. From Klopstock’s house we walked
10992,RATZEBURG.,"to the ramparts, discoursing together on the poet and his conversation,"
10993,RATZEBURG.,till our attention was diverted to the beauty and singularity of the
10994,RATZEBURG.,sunset and its effects on the objects around us. There were woods in the
10995,RATZEBURG.,"distance. A rich sandy light, (nay, of a much deeper colour than sandy,)"
10996,RATZEBURG.,lay over these woods that blackened in the blaze. Over that part of
10997,RATZEBURG.,"the woods which lay immediately under the intenser light, a brassy mist"
10998,RATZEBURG.,"floated. The trees on the ramparts, and the people moving to and fro"
10999,RATZEBURG.,"between them, were cut or divided into equal segments of deep shade and"
11000,RATZEBURG.,"brassy light. Had the trees, and the bodies of the men and women, been"
11001,RATZEBURG.,"divided into equal segments by a rule or pair of compasses, the portions"
11002,RATZEBURG.,could not have been more regular. All else was obscure. It was a
11003,RATZEBURG.,"fairy scene!--and to increase its romantic character, among the moving"
11004,RATZEBURG.,"objects, thus divided into alternate shade and brightness, was a"
11005,RATZEBURG.,"beautiful child, dressed with the elegant simplicity of an English"
11006,RATZEBURG.,"child, riding on a stately goat, the saddle, bridle, and other"
11007,RATZEBURG.,accoutrements of which were in a high degree costly and splendid. Before
11008,RATZEBURG.,"I quit the subject of Hamburg, let me say, that I remained a day or two"
11009,RATZEBURG.,"longer than I otherwise should have done, in order to be present at the"
11010,RATZEBURG.,"feast of St. Michael, the patron saint of Hamburg, expecting to see"
11011,RATZEBURG.,the civic pomp of this commercial Republic. I was however disappointed.
11012,RATZEBURG.,"There were no processions, two or three sermons were preached to two"
11013,RATZEBURG.,"or three old women in two or three churches, and St. Michael and"
11014,RATZEBURG.,"his patronage wished elsewhere by the higher classes, all places of"
11015,RATZEBURG.,"entertainment, theatre, etc. being shut up on this day. In Hamburg,"
11016,RATZEBURG.,there seems to be no religion at all; in Luebec it is confined to the
11017,RATZEBURG.,women. The men seemed determined to be divorced from their wives in the
11018,RATZEBURG.,"other world, if they cannot in this. You will not easily conceive a more"
11019,RATZEBURG.,"singular sight, than is presented by the vast aisle of the principal"
11020,RATZEBURG.,"church at Luebec, seen from the organ loft: for being filled with female"
11021,RATZEBURG.,"servants and persons in the same class of life, and all their caps"
11022,RATZEBURG.,"having gold and silver cauls, it appears like a rich pavement of gold"
11023,RATZEBURG.,and silver.
11024,RATZEBURG.,
11025,RATZEBURG.,"I will conclude this letter with the mere transcription of notes, which"
11026,RATZEBURG.,"my friend W---- made of his conversations with Klopstock, during the"
11027,RATZEBURG.,interviews that took place after my departure. On these I shall make but
11028,RATZEBURG.,"one remark at present, and that will appear a presumptuous one, namely,"
11029,RATZEBURG.,that Klopstock’s remarks on the venerable sage of Koenigsburg are to my
11030,RATZEBURG.,"own knowledge injurious and mistaken; and so far is it from being true,"
11031,RATZEBURG.,"that his system is now given up, that throughout the Universities of"
11032,RATZEBURG.,Germany there is not a single professor who is not either a Kantean or
11033,RATZEBURG.,"a disciple of Fichte, whose system is built on the Kantean, and"
11034,RATZEBURG.,"presupposes its truth; or lastly who, though an antagonist of Kant, as"
11035,RATZEBURG.,"to his theoretical work, has not embraced wholly or in part his moral"
11036,RATZEBURG.,"system, and adopted part of his nomenclature. “Klopstock having wished"
11037,RATZEBURG.,"to see the CALVARY of Cumberland, and asked what was thought of it in"
11038,RATZEBURG.,"England, I went to Remnant’s (the English bookseller) where I procured"
11039,RATZEBURG.,"the Analytical Review, in which is contained the review of Cumberland’s"
11040,RATZEBURG.,CALVARY. I remembered to have read there some specimens of a blank verse
11041,RATZEBURG.,"translation of THE MESSIAH. I had mentioned this to Klopstock, and he"
11042,RATZEBURG.,had a great desire to see them. I walked over to his house and put the
11043,RATZEBURG.,"book into his hands. On adverting to his own poem, he told me he began"
11044,RATZEBURG.,THE MESSIAH when he was seventeen; he devoted three entire years to the
11045,RATZEBURG.,plan without composing a single line. He was greatly at a loss in
11046,RATZEBURG.,what manner to execute his work. There were no successful specimens of
11047,RATZEBURG.,versification in the German language before this time. The first three
11048,RATZEBURG.,"cantos he wrote in a species of measured or numerous prose. This, though"
11049,RATZEBURG.,"done with much labour and some success, was far from satisfying him. He"
11050,RATZEBURG.,"had composed hexameters both Latin and Greek as a school exercise, and"
11051,RATZEBURG.,there had been also in the German language attempts in that style of
11052,RATZEBURG.,versification. These were only of very moderate merit.--One day he was
11053,RATZEBURG.,struck with the idea of what could be done in this way--he kept his
11054,RATZEBURG.,"room a whole day, even went without his dinner, and found that in the"
11055,RATZEBURG.,"evening he had written twenty-three hexameters, versifying a part of"
11056,RATZEBURG.,"what he had before written in prose. From that time, pleased with his"
11057,RATZEBURG.,"efforts, he composed no more in prose. Today he informed me that he"
11058,RATZEBURG.,had finished his plan before he read Milton. He was enchanted to see an
11059,RATZEBURG.,author who before him had trod the same path. This is a contradiction
11060,RATZEBURG.,of what he said before. He did not wish to speak of his poem to any one
11061,RATZEBURG.,till it was finished: but some of his friends who had seen what he had
11062,RATZEBURG.,"finished, tormented him till he had consented to publish a few books in"
11063,RATZEBURG.,"a journal. He was then, I believe, very young, about twenty-five."
11064,RATZEBURG.,"The rest was printed at different periods, four books at a time. The"
11065,RATZEBURG.,reception given to the first specimens was highly flattering. He was
11066,RATZEBURG.,"nearly thirty years in finishing the whole poem, but of these thirty"
11067,RATZEBURG.,years not more than two were employed in the composition. He only
11068,RATZEBURG.,composed in favourable moments; besides he had other occupations. He
11069,RATZEBURG.,"values himself upon the plan of his odes, and accuses the modern lyrical"
11070,RATZEBURG.,writers of gross deficiency in this respect. I laid the same accusation
11071,RATZEBURG.,against Horace: he would not hear of it--but waived the discussion.
11072,RATZEBURG.,He called Rousseau’s ODE TO FORTUNE a moral dissertation in stanzas.
11073,RATZEBURG.,I spoke of Dryden’s ST. CECILIA; but he did not seem familiar with our
11074,RATZEBURG.,writers. He wished to know the distinctions between our dramatic and
11075,RATZEBURG.,epic blank verse. He recommended me to read his HERMANN before I read
11076,RATZEBURG.,either THE MESSIAH or the odes. He flattered himself that some time or
11077,RATZEBURG.,other his dramatic poems would be known in England. He had not heard of
11078,RATZEBURG.,Cowper. He thought that Voss in his translation of THE ILIAD had done
11079,RATZEBURG.,"violence to the idiom of the Germans, and had sacrificed it to the"
11080,RATZEBURG.,"Greeks, not remembering sufficiently that each language has its"
11081,RATZEBURG.,particular spirit and genius. He said Lessing was the first of their
11082,RATZEBURG.,dramatic writers. I complained of NATHAN as tedious. He said there was
11083,RATZEBURG.,not enough of action in it; but that Lessing was the most chaste of
11084,RATZEBURG.,their writers. He spoke favourably of Goethe; but said that his SORROWS
11085,RATZEBURG.,"OF WERTER was his best work, better than any of his dramas: he preferred"
11086,RATZEBURG.,the first written to the rest of Goethe’s dramas. Schiller’s ROBBERS he
11087,RATZEBURG.,"found so extravagant, that he could not read it. I spoke of the scene of"
11088,RATZEBURG.,the setting sun. He did not know it. He said Schiller could not live.
11089,RATZEBURG.,He thought DON CARLOS the best of his dramas; but said that the plot
11090,RATZEBURG.,was inextricable.--It was evident he knew little of Schiller’s works:
11091,RATZEBURG.,"indeed, he said, he could not read them. Buerger, he said, was a true"
11092,RATZEBURG.,"poet, and would live; that Schiller, on the contrary, must soon be"
11093,RATZEBURG.,"forgotten; that he gave himself up to the imitation of Shakespeare, who"
11094,RATZEBURG.,"often was extravagant, but that Schiller was ten thousand times more so."
11095,RATZEBURG.,"He spoke very slightingly of Kotzebue, as an immoral author in the first"
11096,RATZEBURG.,"place, and next, as deficient in power. At Vienna, said he, they are"
11097,RATZEBURG.,transported with him; but we do not reckon the people of Vienna either
11098,RATZEBURG.,the wisest or the wittiest people of Germany. He said Wieland was a
11099,RATZEBURG.,"charming author, and a sovereign master of his own language: that in"
11100,RATZEBURG.,"this respect Goethe could not be compared to him, nor indeed could any"
11101,RATZEBURG.,body else. He said that his fault was to be fertile to exuberance. I
11102,RATZEBURG.,told him the OBERON had just been translated into English. He asked me
11103,RATZEBURG.,"if I was not delighted with the poem. I answered, that I thought the"
11104,RATZEBURG.,"story began to flag about the seventh or eighth book; and observed, that"
11105,RATZEBURG.,it was unworthy of a man of genius to make the interest of a long poem
11106,RATZEBURG.,turn entirely upon animal gratification. He seemed at first disposed to
11107,RATZEBURG.,"excuse this by saying, that there are different subjects for poetry, and"
11108,RATZEBURG.,"that poets are not willing to be restricted in their choice. I answered,"
11109,RATZEBURG.,that I thought the passion of love as well suited to the purposes of
11110,RATZEBURG.,poetry as any other passion; but that it was a cheap way of pleasing
11111,RATZEBURG.,to fix the attention of the reader through a long poem on the mere
11112,RATZEBURG.,"appetite. Well! but, said he, you see, that such poems please every"
11113,RATZEBURG.,"body. I answered, that it was the province of a great poet to raise"
11114,RATZEBURG.,"people up to his own level, not to descend to theirs. He agreed, and"
11115,RATZEBURG.,"confessed, that on no account whatsoever would he have written a work"
11116,RATZEBURG.,"like the OBERON. He spoke in raptures of Wieland’s style, and pointed"
11117,RATZEBURG.,"out the passage where Retzia is delivered of her child, as exquisitely"
11118,RATZEBURG.,beautiful. I said that I did not perceive any very striking passages;
11119,RATZEBURG.,but that I made allowance for the imperfections of a translation. Of the
11120,RATZEBURG.,"thefts of Wieland, he said, they were so exquisitely managed, that the"
11121,RATZEBURG.,greatest writers might be proud to steal as he did. He considered the
11122,RATZEBURG.,books and fables of old romance writers in the light of the ancient
11123,RATZEBURG.,"mythology, as a sort of common property, from which a man was free to"
11124,RATZEBURG.,take whatever he could make a good use of. An Englishman had presented
11125,RATZEBURG.,"him with the odes of Collins, which he had read with pleasure. He"
11126,RATZEBURG.,"knew little or nothing of Gray, except his ELEGY written in a country"
11127,RATZEBURG.,CHURCH-YARD. He complained of the fool in LEAR. I observed that he
11128,RATZEBURG.,seemed to give a terrible wildness to the distress; but still he
11129,RATZEBURG.,"complained. He asked whether it was not allowed, that Pope had written"
11130,RATZEBURG.,rhymed poetry with more skill than any of our writers--I said I
11131,RATZEBURG.,"preferred Dryden, because his couplets had greater variety in their"
11132,RATZEBURG.,movement. He thought my reason a good one; but asked whether the rhyme
11133,RATZEBURG.,of Pope were not more exact. This question I understood as applying to
11134,RATZEBURG.,"the final terminations, and observed to him that I believed it was the"
11135,RATZEBURG.,case; but that I thought it was easy to excuse some inaccuracy in the
11136,RATZEBURG.,"final sounds, if the general sweep of the verse was superior. I told him"
11137,RATZEBURG.,that we were not so exact with regard to the final endings of the lines
11138,RATZEBURG.,as the French. He did not seem to know that we made no distinction
11139,RATZEBURG.,"between masculine and feminine (i.e. single or double,) rhymes: at"
11140,RATZEBURG.,least he put inquiries to me on this subject. He seemed to think that
11141,RATZEBURG.,no language could be so far formed as that it might not be enriched by
11142,RATZEBURG.,idioms borrowed from another tongue. I said this was a very dangerous
11143,RATZEBURG.,"practice; and added, that I thought Milton had often injured both his"
11144,RATZEBURG.,prose and verse by taking this liberty too frequently. I recommended to
11145,RATZEBURG.,him the prose works of Dryden as models of pure and native English. I
11146,RATZEBURG.,"was treading upon tender ground, as I have reason to suppose that he has"
11147,RATZEBURG.,himself liberally indulged in the practice.”
11148,RATZEBURG.,
11149,RATZEBURG.,"The same day I dined at Mr. Klopstock’s, where I had the pleasure of a"
11150,RATZEBURG.,third interview with the poet. We talked principally about indifferent
11151,RATZEBURG.,things. I asked him what he thought of Kant. He said that his reputation
11152,RATZEBURG.,was much on the decline in Germany. That for his own part he was not
11153,RATZEBURG.,"surprised to find it so, as the works of Kant were to him utterly"
11154,RATZEBURG.,incomprehensible--that he had often been pestered by the Kanteans;
11155,RATZEBURG.,but was rarely in the practice of arguing with them. His custom was to
11156,RATZEBURG.,"produce the book, open it and point to a passage, and beg they would"
11157,RATZEBURG.,explain it. This they ordinarily attempted to do by substituting their
11158,RATZEBURG.,"own ideas. I do not want, I say, an explanation of your own ideas, but"
11159,RATZEBURG.,of the passage which is before us. In this way I generally bring the
11160,RATZEBURG.,dispute to an immediate conclusion. He spoke of Wolfe as the first
11161,RATZEBURG.,Metaphysician they had in Germany. Wolfe had followers; but they could
11162,RATZEBURG.,"hardly be called a sect, and luckily till the appearance of Kant,"
11163,RATZEBURG.,"about fifteen years ago, Germany had not been pestered by any sect of"
11164,RATZEBURG.,philosophers whatsoever; but that each man had separately pursued his
11165,RATZEBURG.,inquiries uncontrolled by the dogmas of a master. Kant had appeared
11166,RATZEBURG.,ambitious to be the founder of a sect; that he had succeeded: but that
11167,RATZEBURG.,the Germans were now coming to their senses again. That Nicolai and
11168,RATZEBURG.,Engel had in different ways contributed to disenchant the nation; but
11169,RATZEBURG.,above all the incomprehensibility of the philosopher and his philosophy.
11170,RATZEBURG.,"He seemed pleased to hear, that as yet Kant’s doctrines had not met with"
11171,RATZEBURG.,many admirers in England--did not doubt but that we had too much wisdom
11172,RATZEBURG.,to be duped by a writer who set at defiance the common sense and common
11173,RATZEBURG.,understandings of men. We talked of tragedy. He seemed to rate highly
11174,RATZEBURG.,the power of exciting tears--I said that nothing was more easy than to
11175,RATZEBURG.,"deluge an audience, that it was done every day by the meanest writers."
11176,RATZEBURG.,
11177,RATZEBURG.,"I must remind you, my friend, first, that these notes are not intended"
11178,RATZEBURG.,"as specimens of Klopstock’s intellectual power, or even “colloquial"
11179,RATZEBURG.,"prowess,” to judge of which by an accidental conversation, and this with"
11180,RATZEBURG.,"strangers, and those too foreigners, would be not only unreasonable, but"
11181,RATZEBURG.,"calumnious. Secondly, I attribute little other interest to the remarks"
11182,RATZEBURG.,than what is derived from the celebrity of the person who made them.
11183,RATZEBURG.,"Lastly, if you ask me, whether I have read THE MESSIAH, and what I"
11184,RATZEBURG.,think of it? I answer--as yet the first four books only: and as to my
11185,RATZEBURG.,opinion--(the reasons of which hereafter)--you may guess it from what
11186,RATZEBURG.,"I could not help muttering to myself, when the good pastor this morning"
11187,RATZEBURG.,"told me, that Klopstock was the German Milton--“a very German Milton"
11188,RATZEBURG.,indeed!!!”

11220,CHAPTER XXIII,"You remember, my dear Sir, that Mr. Whitbread, shortly before his death,"
11221,CHAPTER XXIII,"proposed to the assembled subscribers of Drury Lane Theatre, that the"
11222,CHAPTER XXIII,concern should be farmed to some responsible individual under certain
11223,CHAPTER XXIII,"conditions and limitations: and that his proposal was rejected,"
11224,CHAPTER XXIII,"not without indignation, as subversive of the main object, for the"
11225,CHAPTER XXIII,attainment of which the enlightened and patriotic assemblage of
11226,CHAPTER XXIII,philodramatists had been induced to risk their subscriptions. Now this
11227,CHAPTER XXIII,object was avowed to be no less than the redemption of the British stage
11228,CHAPTER XXIII,"not only from horses, dogs, elephants, and the like zoological rarities,"
11229,CHAPTER XXIII,but also from the more pernicious barbarisms and Kotzebuisms in morals
11230,CHAPTER XXIII,and taste. Drury Lane was to be restored to its former classical renown;
11231,CHAPTER XXIII,"Shakespeare, Jonson, and Otway, with the expurgated muses of Vanbrugh,"
11232,CHAPTER XXIII,"Congreve, and Wycherley, were to be reinaugurated in their rightful"
11233,CHAPTER XXIII,dominion over British audiences; and the Herculean process was to
11234,CHAPTER XXIII,"commence, by exterminating the speaking monsters imported from the banks"
11235,CHAPTER XXIII,"of the Danube, compared with which their mute relations, the emigrants"
11236,CHAPTER XXIII,"from Exeter ’Change, and Polito (late Pidcock’s) show-carts, were tame"
11237,CHAPTER XXIII,"and inoffensive. Could an heroic project, at once so refined and so"
11238,CHAPTER XXIII,"arduous, be consistently entrusted to, could its success be rationally"
11239,CHAPTER XXIII,"expected from, a mercenary manager, at whose critical quarantine the"
11240,CHAPTER XXIII,lucri bonus odor would conciliate a bill of health to the plague in
11241,CHAPTER XXIII,"person? No! As the work proposed, such must be the work-masters. Rank,"
11242,CHAPTER XXIII,"fortune, liberal education, and (their natural accompaniments, or"
11243,CHAPTER XXIII,"consequences) critical discernment, delicate tact, disinterestedness,"
11244,CHAPTER XXIII,"unsuspected morals, notorious patriotism, and tried Maecenasship, these"
11245,CHAPTER XXIII,were the recommendations that influenced the votes of the proprietary
11246,CHAPTER XXIII,"subscribers of Drury Lane Theatre, these the motives that occasioned the"
11247,CHAPTER XXIII,election of its Supreme Committee of Management. This circumstance alone
11248,CHAPTER XXIII,"would have excited a strong interest in the public mind, respecting the"
11249,CHAPTER XXIII,first production of the Tragic Muse which had been announced under such
11250,CHAPTER XXIII,"auspices, and had passed the ordeal of such judgments: and the tragedy,"
11251,CHAPTER XXIII,"on which you have requested my judgment, was the work on which the great"
11252,CHAPTER XXIII,"expectations, justified by so many causes, were doomed at length to"
11253,CHAPTER XXIII,settle.
11254,CHAPTER XXIII,
11255,CHAPTER XXIII,"But before I enter on the examination of BERTRAM, or THE CASTLE OF ST."
11256,CHAPTER XXIII,"ALDOBRAND, I shall interpose a few words, on the phrase German Drama,"
11257,CHAPTER XXIII,"which I hold to be altogether a misnomer. At the time of Lessing, the"
11258,CHAPTER XXIII,"German stage, such as it was, appears to have been a flat and servile"
11259,CHAPTER XXIII,copy of the French. It was Lessing who first introduced the name and the
11260,CHAPTER XXIII,works of Shakespeare to the admiration of the Germans; and I should not
11261,CHAPTER XXIII,"perhaps go too far, if I add, that it was Lessing who first proved to"
11262,CHAPTER XXIII,"all thinking men, even to Shakespeare’s own countrymen, the true nature"
11263,CHAPTER XXIII,"of his apparent irregularities. These, he demonstrated, were deviations"
11264,CHAPTER XXIII,only from the accidents of the Greek tragedy; and from such accidents as
11265,CHAPTER XXIII,"hung a heavy weight on the wings of the Greek poets, and narrowed"
11266,CHAPTER XXIII,their flight within the limits of what we may call the heroic opera. He
11267,CHAPTER XXIII,"proved, that, in all the essentials of art, no less than in the truth of"
11268,CHAPTER XXIII,"nature, the Plays of Shakespeare were incomparably more coincident"
11269,CHAPTER XXIII,"with the principles of Aristotle, than the productions of Corneille"
11270,CHAPTER XXIII,"and Racine, notwithstanding the boasted regularity of the latter. Under"
11271,CHAPTER XXIII,these convictions were Lessing’s own dramatic works composed. Their
11272,CHAPTER XXIII,deficiency is in depth and imagination: their excellence is in the
11273,CHAPTER XXIII,construction of the plot; the good sense of the sentiments; the sobriety
11274,CHAPTER XXIII,of the morals; and the high polish of the diction and dialogue. In
11275,CHAPTER XXIII,"short, his dramas are the very antipodes of all those which it has been"
11276,CHAPTER XXIII,"the fashion of late years at once to abuse and enjoy, under the name of"
11277,CHAPTER XXIII,"the German drama. Of this latter, Schiller’s ROBBERS was the earliest"
11278,CHAPTER XXIII,"specimen; the first fruits of his youth, (I had almost said of his"
11279,CHAPTER XXIII,"boyhood), and as such, the pledge, and promise of no ordinary genius."
11280,CHAPTER XXIII,"Only as such, did the maturer judgment of the author tolerate the Play."
11281,CHAPTER XXIII,During his whole life he expressed himself concerning this production
11282,CHAPTER XXIII,"with more than needful asperity, as a monster not less offensive to good"
11283,CHAPTER XXIII,"taste, than to sound morals; and, in his latter years, his indignation"
11284,CHAPTER XXIII,at the unwonted popularity of the ROBBERS seduced him into the contrary
11285,CHAPTER XXIII,"extremes, viz. a studied feebleness of interest, (as far as the interest"
11286,CHAPTER XXIII,was to be derived from incidents and the excitement of curiosity);
11287,CHAPTER XXIII,a diction elaborately metrical; the affectation of rhymes; and the
11288,CHAPTER XXIII,pedantry of the chorus.
11289,CHAPTER XXIII,
11290,CHAPTER XXIII,"But to understand the true character of the ROBBERS, and of the"
11291,CHAPTER XXIII,"countless imitations which were its spawn, I must inform you, or at"
11292,CHAPTER XXIII,"least call to your recollection, that, about that time, and for some"
11293,CHAPTER XXIII,"years before it, three of the most popular books in the German language"
11294,CHAPTER XXIII,"were, the translations Of YOUNG’S NIGHT THOUGHTS, HERVEY’S MEDITATIONS,"
11295,CHAPTER XXIII,and RICHARDSON’S CLARISSA HARLOW. Now we have only to combine the
11296,CHAPTER XXIII,"bloated style and peculiar rhythm of Hervey, which is poetic only on"
11297,CHAPTER XXIII,"account of its utter unfitness for prose, and might as appropriately"
11298,CHAPTER XXIII,"be called prosaic, from its utter unfitness for poetry; we have only,"
11299,CHAPTER XXIII,"I repeat, to combine these Herveyisms with the strained thoughts, the"
11300,CHAPTER XXIII,figurative metaphysics and solemn epigrams of Young on the one hand; and
11301,CHAPTER XXIII,"with the loaded sensibility, the minute detail, the morbid consciousness"
11302,CHAPTER XXIII,"of every thought and feeling in the whole flux and reflux of the mind,"
11303,CHAPTER XXIII,in short the self-involution and dreamlike continuity of Richardson on
11304,CHAPTER XXIII,"the other hand; and then to add the horrific incidents, and mysterious"
11305,CHAPTER XXIII,"villains, (geniuses of supernatural intellect, if you will take the"
11306,CHAPTER XXIII,"authors’ words for it, but on a level with the meanest ruffians of"
11307,CHAPTER XXIII,"the condemned cells, if we are to judge by their actions and"
11308,CHAPTER XXIII,"contrivances)--to add the ruined castles, the dungeons, the trap-doors,"
11309,CHAPTER XXIII,"the skeletons, the flesh-and-blood ghosts, and the perpetual moonshine"
11310,CHAPTER XXIII,"of a modern author, (themselves the literary brood of the CASTLE OF"
11311,CHAPTER XXIII,"OTRANTO, the translations of which, with the imitations and improvements"
11312,CHAPTER XXIII,"aforesaid, were about that time beginning to make as much noise in"
11313,CHAPTER XXIII,"Germany as their originals were making in England),--and as the compound"
11314,CHAPTER XXIII,"of these ingredients duly mixed, you will recognize the so-called German"
11315,CHAPTER XXIII,"drama. The olla podrida thus cooked up, was denounced, by the best"
11316,CHAPTER XXIII,"critics in Germany, as the mere cramps of weakness, and orgasms of a"
11317,CHAPTER XXIII,"sickly imagination on the part of the author, and the lowest provocation"
11318,CHAPTER XXIII,"of torpid feeling on that of the readers. The old blunder, however,"
11319,CHAPTER XXIII,"concerning the irregularity and wildness of Shakespeare, in which the"
11320,CHAPTER XXIII,"German did but echo the French, who again were but the echoes of our own"
11321,CHAPTER XXIII,"critics, was still in vogue, and Shakespeare was quoted as authority for"
11322,CHAPTER XXIII,the most anti-Shakespearean drama. We have indeed two poets who wrote as
11323,CHAPTER XXIII,"one, near the age of Shakespeare, to whom, (as the worst characteristic"
11324,CHAPTER XXIII,"of their writings), the Coryphaeus of the present drama may challenge"
11325,CHAPTER XXIII,"the honour of being a poor relation, or impoverished descendant. For"
11326,CHAPTER XXIII,"if we would charitably consent to forget the comic humour, the wit, the"
11327,CHAPTER XXIII,"felicities of style, in other words, all the poetry, and nine-tenths of"
11328,CHAPTER XXIII,"all the genius of Beaumont and Fletcher, that which would remain becomes"
11329,CHAPTER XXIII,a Kotzebue.
11330,CHAPTER XXIII,
11331,CHAPTER XXIII,"The so-called German drama, therefore, is English in its origin, English"
11332,CHAPTER XXIII,"in its materials, and English by re-adoption; and till we can prove that"
11333,CHAPTER XXIII,"Kotzebue, or any of the whole breed of Kotzebues, whether dramatists or"
11334,CHAPTER XXIII,"romantic writers, or writers of romantic dramas, were ever admitted"
11335,CHAPTER XXIII,to any other shelf in the libraries of well-educated Germans than were
11336,CHAPTER XXIII,"occupied by their originals, and apes’ apes in their mother country,"
11337,CHAPTER XXIII,we should submit to carry our own brat on our own shoulders; or rather
11338,CHAPTER XXIII,consider it as a lack-grace returned from transportation with such
11339,CHAPTER XXIII,improvements only in growth and manners as young transported convicts
11340,CHAPTER XXIII,usually come home with.
11341,CHAPTER XXIII,
11342,CHAPTER XXIII,I know nothing that contributes more to a clearer insight into the true
11343,CHAPTER XXIII,"nature of any literary phaenomenon, than the comparison of it with some"
11344,CHAPTER XXIII,"elder production, the likeness of which is striking, yet only apparent,"
11345,CHAPTER XXIII,while the difference is real. In the present case this opportunity is
11346,CHAPTER XXIII,"furnished us, by the old Spanish play, entitled Atheista Fulminato,"
11347,CHAPTER XXIII,"formerly, and perhaps still, acted in the churches and monasteries of"
11348,CHAPTER XXIII,"Spain, and which, under various names (Don Juan, the Libertine,"
11349,CHAPTER XXIII,etc.) has had its day of favour in every country throughout Europe. A
11350,CHAPTER XXIII,"popularity so extensive, and of a work so grotesque and extravagant,"
11351,CHAPTER XXIII,claims and merits philosophical attention and investigation. The first
11352,CHAPTER XXIII,"point to be noticed is, that the play is throughout imaginative."
11353,CHAPTER XXIII,"Nothing of it belongs to the real world, but the names of the places and"
11354,CHAPTER XXIII,"persons. The comic parts, equally with the tragic; the living, equally"
11355,CHAPTER XXIII,"with the defunct characters, are creatures of the brain; as little"
11356,CHAPTER XXIII,"amenable to the rules of ordinary probability, as the Satan Of PARADISE"
11357,CHAPTER XXIII,"LOST, or the Caliban of THE TEMPEST, and therefore to be understood"
11358,CHAPTER XXIII,"and judged of as impersonated abstractions. Rank, fortune, wit, talent,"
11359,CHAPTER XXIII,"acquired knowledge, and liberal accomplishments, with beauty of person,"
11360,CHAPTER XXIII,"vigorous health, and constitutional hardihood,--all these advantages,"
11361,CHAPTER XXIII,elevated by the habits and sympathies of noble birth and national
11362,CHAPTER XXIII,"character, are supposed to have combined in Don Juan, so as to give him"
11363,CHAPTER XXIII,the means of carrying into all its practical consequences the doctrine
11364,CHAPTER XXIII,"of a godless nature, as the sole ground and efficient cause not only of"
11365,CHAPTER XXIII,"all things, events, and appearances, but likewise of all our thoughts,"
11366,CHAPTER XXIII,"sensations, impulses and actions. Obedience to nature is the only"
11367,CHAPTER XXIII,virtue: the gratification of the passions and appetites her only
11368,CHAPTER XXIII,dictate: each individual’s self-will the sole organ through which nature
11369,CHAPTER XXIII,"utters her commands, and"
11370,CHAPTER XXIII,
11371,CHAPTER XXIII,“Self-contradiction is the only wrong!
11372,CHAPTER XXIII,"For, by the laws of spirit, in the right"
11373,CHAPTER XXIII,Is every individual character
11374,CHAPTER XXIII,That acts in strict consistence with itself.”
11375,CHAPTER XXIII,
11376,CHAPTER XXIII,"That speculative opinions, however impious and daring they may be, are"
11377,CHAPTER XXIII,"not always followed by correspondent conduct, is most true, as well as"
11378,CHAPTER XXIII,"that they can scarcely in any instance be systematically realized, on"
11379,CHAPTER XXIII,account of their unsuitableness to human nature and to the institutions
11380,CHAPTER XXIII,"of society. It can be hell, only where it is all hell: and a separate"
11381,CHAPTER XXIII,world of devils is necessary for the existence of any one complete
11382,CHAPTER XXIII,"devil. But on the other hand it is no less clear, nor, with the"
11383,CHAPTER XXIII,"biography of Carrier and his fellow atheists before us, can it be denied"
11384,CHAPTER XXIII,"without wilful blindness, that the (so called) system of nature (that"
11385,CHAPTER XXIII,"is, materialism, with the utter rejection of moral responsibility, of"
11386,CHAPTER XXIII,"a present Providence, and of both present and future retribution)"
11387,CHAPTER XXIII,"may influence the characters and actions of individuals, and even of"
11388,CHAPTER XXIII,"communities, to a degree that almost does away the distinction between"
11389,CHAPTER XXIII,"men and devils, and will make the page of the future historian resemble"
11390,CHAPTER XXIII,the narration of a madman’s dreams. It is not the wickedness of Don
11391,CHAPTER XXIII,"Juan, therefore, which constitutes the character an abstraction, and"
11392,CHAPTER XXIII,removes it from the rules of probability; but the rapid succession of
11393,CHAPTER XXIII,"the correspondent acts and incidents, his intellectual superiority,"
11394,CHAPTER XXIII,"and the splendid accumulation of his gifts and desirable qualities, as"
11395,CHAPTER XXIII,co-existent with entire wickedness in one and the same person. But this
11396,CHAPTER XXIII,likewise is the very circumstance which gives to this strange play its
11397,CHAPTER XXIII,"charm and universal interest. Don Juan is, from beginning to end, an"
11398,CHAPTER XXIII,intelligible character: as much so as the Satan of Milton. The poet asks
11399,CHAPTER XXIII,"only of the reader, what, as a poet, he is privileged to ask: namely,"
11400,CHAPTER XXIII,"that sort of negative faith in the existence of such a being, which we"
11401,CHAPTER XXIII,"willingly give to productions professedly ideal, and a disposition"
11402,CHAPTER XXIII,"to the same state of feeling, as that with which we contemplate the"
11403,CHAPTER XXIII,"idealized figures of the Apollo Belvidere, and the Farnese Hercules."
11404,CHAPTER XXIII,"What the Hercules is to the eye in corporeal strength, Don Juan is"
11405,CHAPTER XXIII,to the mind in strength of character. The ideal consists in the happy
11406,CHAPTER XXIII,balance of the generic with the individual. The former makes the
11407,CHAPTER XXIII,"character representative and symbolical, therefore instructive; because,"
11408,CHAPTER XXIII,"mutatis mutandis, it is applicable to whole classes of men. The latter"
11409,CHAPTER XXIII,"gives it living interest; for nothing lives or is real, but as definite"
11410,CHAPTER XXIII,"and individual. To understand this completely, the reader need only"
11411,CHAPTER XXIII,"recollect the specific state of his feelings, when in looking at a"
11412,CHAPTER XXIII,"picture of the historic (more properly of the poetic or heroic) class,"
11413,CHAPTER XXIII,he objects to a particular figure as being too much of a portrait;
11414,CHAPTER XXIII,and this interruption of his complacency he feels without the least
11415,CHAPTER XXIII,"reference to, or the least acquaintance with, any person in real life"
11416,CHAPTER XXIII,whom he might recognise in this figure. It is enough that such a figure
11417,CHAPTER XXIII,"is not ideal: and therefore not ideal, because one of the two factors"
11418,CHAPTER XXIII,or elements of the ideal is in excess. A similar and more powerful
11419,CHAPTER XXIII,objection he would feel towards a set of figures which were mere
11420,CHAPTER XXIII,"abstractions, like those of Cipriani, and what have been called Greek"
11421,CHAPTER XXIII,"forms and faces, that is, outlines drawn according to a recipe. These"
11422,CHAPTER XXIII,again are not ideal; because in these the other element is in excess.
11423,CHAPTER XXIII,"“Forma formans per formam formatam translucens,” [80] is the definition"
11424,CHAPTER XXIII,and perfection of ideal art.
11425,CHAPTER XXIII,
11426,CHAPTER XXIII,"This excellence is so happily achieved in the Don Juan, that it is"
11427,CHAPTER XXIII,"capable of interesting without poetry, nay, even without words, as in"
11428,CHAPTER XXIII,our pantomime of that name. We see clearly how the character is formed;
11429,CHAPTER XXIII,"and the very extravagance of the incidents, and the super-human"
11430,CHAPTER XXIII,"entireness of Don Juan’s agency, prevents the wickedness from shocking"
11431,CHAPTER XXIII,our minds to any painful degree. We do not believe it enough for this
11432,CHAPTER XXIII,"effect; no, not even with that kind of temporary and negative belief or"
11433,CHAPTER XXIII,acquiescence which I have described above. Meantime the qualities of his
11434,CHAPTER XXIII,"character are too desirable, too flattering to our pride and our wishes,"
11435,CHAPTER XXIII,not to make up on this side as much additional faith as was lost on
11436,CHAPTER XXIII,the other. There is no danger (thinks the spectator or reader) of my
11437,CHAPTER XXIII,becoming such a monster of iniquity as Don Juan! I never shall be an
11438,CHAPTER XXIII,atheist! I shall never disallow all distinction between right and wrong!
11439,CHAPTER XXIII,I have not the least inclination to be so outrageous a drawcansir in my
11440,CHAPTER XXIII,love affairs! But to possess such a power of captivating and enchanting
11441,CHAPTER XXIII,the affections of the other sex!--to be capable of inspiring in a
11442,CHAPTER XXIII,"charming and even a virtuous woman, a love so deep, and so entirely"
11443,CHAPTER XXIII,"personal to me!--that even my worst vices, (if I were vicious), even"
11444,CHAPTER XXIII,"my cruelty and perfidy, (if I were cruel and perfidious), could not"
11445,CHAPTER XXIII,"eradicate the passion!--to be so loved for my own self, that even with a"
11446,CHAPTER XXIII,"distinct knowledge of my character, she yet died to save me!--this, sir,"
11447,CHAPTER XXIII,"takes hold of two sides of our nature, the better and the worse. For the"
11448,CHAPTER XXIII,"heroic disinterestedness, to which love can transport a woman, can"
11449,CHAPTER XXIII,not be contemplated without an honourable emotion of reverence towards
11450,CHAPTER XXIII,"womanhood: and, on the other hand, it is among the miseries, and abides"
11451,CHAPTER XXIII,"in the dark ground-work of our nature, to crave an outward confirmation"
11452,CHAPTER XXIII,"of that something within us, which is our very self, that something,"
11453,CHAPTER XXIII,"not made up of our qualities and relations, but itself the supporter and"
11454,CHAPTER XXIII,"substantial basis of all these. Love me, and not my qualities, may be"
11455,CHAPTER XXIII,"a vicious and an insane wish, but it is not a wish wholly without a"
11456,CHAPTER XXIII,meaning.
11457,CHAPTER XXIII,
11458,CHAPTER XXIII,"Without power, virtue would be insufficient and incapable of revealing"
11459,CHAPTER XXIII,its being. It would resemble the magic transformation of Tasso’s heroine
11460,CHAPTER XXIII,"into a tree, in which she could only groan and bleed. Hence power is"
11461,CHAPTER XXIII,necessarily an object of our desire and of our admiration. But of all
11462,CHAPTER XXIII,"power, that of the mind is, on every account, the grand desideratum of"
11463,CHAPTER XXIII,"human ambition. We shall be as Gods in knowledge, was and must have been"
11464,CHAPTER XXIII,the first temptation: and the coexistence of great intellectual lordship
11465,CHAPTER XXIII,with guilt has never been adequately represented without exciting
11466,CHAPTER XXIII,"the strongest interest, and for this reason, that in this bad and"
11467,CHAPTER XXIII,heterogeneous co-ordination we can contemplate the intellect of man more
11468,CHAPTER XXIII,"exclusively as a separate self-subsistence, than in its proper state"
11469,CHAPTER XXIII,"of subordination to his own conscience, or to the will of an infinitely"
11470,CHAPTER XXIII,superior being.
11471,CHAPTER XXIII,
11472,CHAPTER XXIII,This is the sacred charm of Shakespeare’s male characters in general.
11473,CHAPTER XXIII,They are all cast in the mould of Shakespeare’s own gigantic intellect;
11474,CHAPTER XXIII,"and this is the open attraction of his Richard, Iago, Edmund, and others"
11475,CHAPTER XXIII,"in particular. But again; of all intellectual power, that of superiority"
11476,CHAPTER XXIII,to the fear of the invisible world is the most dazzling. Its influence
11477,CHAPTER XXIII,"is abundantly proved by the one circumstance, that it can bribe us into"
11478,CHAPTER XXIII,"a voluntary submission of our better knowledge, into suspension of all"
11479,CHAPTER XXIII,"our judgment derived from constant experience, and enable us to peruse"
11480,CHAPTER XXIII,"with the liveliest interest the wildest tales of ghosts, wizards,"
11481,CHAPTER XXIII,"genii, and secret talismans. On this propensity, so deeply rooted in our"
11482,CHAPTER XXIII,"nature, a specific dramatic probability may be raised by a true poet, if"
11483,CHAPTER XXIII,"the whole of his work be in harmony: a dramatic probability, sufficient"
11484,CHAPTER XXIII,"for dramatic pleasure, even when the component characters and incidents"
11485,CHAPTER XXIII,border on impossibility. The poet does not require us to be awake and
11486,CHAPTER XXIII,believe; he solicits us only to yield ourselves to a dream; and this
11487,CHAPTER XXIII,"too with our eyes open, and with our judgment perdue behind the curtain,"
11488,CHAPTER XXIII,"ready to awaken us at the first motion of our will: and meantime,"
11489,CHAPTER XXIII,"only, not to disbelieve. And in such a state of mind, who but must be"
11490,CHAPTER XXIII,impressed with the cool intrepidity of Don john on the appearance of his
11491,CHAPTER XXIII,father’s ghost:
11492,CHAPTER XXIII,
11493,CHAPTER XXIII,“GHOST.--Monster! behold these wounds!

11609,CHAPTER XXIII,"for devils,” etc."
11610,CHAPTER XXIII,
11611,CHAPTER XXIII,"Nor is the scene from which we quote interesting, in dramatic"
11612,CHAPTER XXIII,probability alone; it is susceptible likewise of a sound moral; of a
11613,CHAPTER XXIII,moral that has more than common claims on the notice of a too numerous
11614,CHAPTER XXIII,"class, who are ready to receive the qualities of gentlemanly courage,"
11615,CHAPTER XXIII,"and scrupulous honour, (in all the recognised laws of honour,) as the"
11616,CHAPTER XXIII,"substitutes of virtue, instead of its ornaments. This, indeed, is the"
11617,CHAPTER XXIII,"moral value of the play at large, and that which places it at a world’s"
11618,CHAPTER XXIII,distance from the spirit of modern jacobinism. The latter introduces
11619,CHAPTER XXIII,"to us clumsy copies of these showy instrumental qualities, in order to"
11620,CHAPTER XXIII,reconcile us to vice and want of principle; while the Atheista Fulminato
11621,CHAPTER XXIII,"presents an exquisite portraiture of the same qualities, in all their"
11622,CHAPTER XXIII,"gloss and glow, but presents them for the sole purpose of displaying"
11623,CHAPTER XXIII,"their hollowness, and in order to put us on our guard by demonstrating"
11624,CHAPTER XXIII,"their utter indifference to vice and virtue, whenever these and the like"
11625,CHAPTER XXIII,accomplishments are contemplated for themselves alone.
11626,CHAPTER XXIII,
11627,CHAPTER XXIII,"Eighteen years ago I observed, that the whole secret of the modern"
11628,CHAPTER XXIII,"jacobinical drama, (which, and not the German, is its appropriate"
11629,CHAPTER XXIII,"designation,) and of all its popularity, consists in the confusion and"
11630,CHAPTER XXIII,subversion of the natural order of things in their causes and effects:
11631,CHAPTER XXIII,"namely, in the excitement of surprise by representing the qualities of"
11632,CHAPTER XXIII,"liberality, refined feeling, and a nice sense of honour (those things"
11633,CHAPTER XXIII,rather which pass amongst us for such) in persons and in classes where
11634,CHAPTER XXIII,experience teaches us least to expect them; and by rewarding with all
11635,CHAPTER XXIII,"the sympathies which are the due of virtue, those criminals whom law,"
11636,CHAPTER XXIII,"reason, and religion have excommunicated from our esteem."
11637,CHAPTER XXIII,
11638,CHAPTER XXIII,"This of itself would lead me back to BERTRAM, or the CASTLE OF ST."
11639,CHAPTER XXIII,"ALDOBRAND; but, in my own mind, this tragedy was brought into connection"
11640,CHAPTER XXIII,"with THE LIBERTINE, (Shadwell’s adaptation of the Atheista Fulminato to"
11641,CHAPTER XXIII,"the English stage in the reign of Charles the Second,) by the fact, that"
11642,CHAPTER XXIII,"our modern drama is taken, in the substance of it, from the first scene"
11643,CHAPTER XXIII,of the third act of THE LIBERTINE. But with what palpable superiority of
11644,CHAPTER XXIII,"judgment in the original! Earth and hell, men and spirits are up in arms"
11645,CHAPTER XXIII,against Don John; the two former acts of the play have not only prepared
11646,CHAPTER XXIII,"us for the supernatural, but accustomed us to the prodigious. It is,"
11647,CHAPTER XXIII,"therefore, neither more nor less than we anticipate when the Captain"
11648,CHAPTER XXIII,"exclaims: “In all the dangers I have been, such horrors I never knew."
11649,CHAPTER XXIII,"I am quite unmanned:” and when the Hermit says, that he had “beheld the"
11650,CHAPTER XXIII,"ocean in wildest rage, yet ne’er before saw a storm so dreadful, such"
11651,CHAPTER XXIII,"horrid flashes of lightning, and such claps of thunder, were never in"
11652,CHAPTER XXIII,my remembrance.” And Don John’s burst of startling impiety is equally
11653,CHAPTER XXIII,"intelligible in its motive, as dramatic in its effect."
11654,CHAPTER XXIII,
11655,CHAPTER XXIII,But what is there to account for the prodigy of the tempest at Bertram’s
11656,CHAPTER XXIII,"shipwreck? It is a mere supernatural effect, without even a hint of any"
11657,CHAPTER XXIII,"supernatural agency; a prodigy, without any circumstance mentioned that"
11658,CHAPTER XXIII,"is prodigious; and a miracle introduced without a ground, and ending"
11659,CHAPTER XXIII,without a result. Every event and every scene of the play might have
11660,CHAPTER XXIII,taken place as well if Bertram and his vessel had been driven in by a
11661,CHAPTER XXIII,"common hard gale, or from want of provisions. The first act would have"
11662,CHAPTER XXIII,indeed lost its greatest and most sonorous picture; a scene for the sake
11663,CHAPTER XXIII,"of a scene, without a word spoken; as such, therefore, (a rarity without"
11664,CHAPTER XXIII,"a precedent), we must take it, and be thankful! In the opinion of not a"
11665,CHAPTER XXIII,"few, it was, in every sense of the word, the best scene in the play."
11666,CHAPTER XXIII,"I am quite certain it was the most innocent: and the steady, quiet"
11667,CHAPTER XXIII,"uprightness of the flame of the wax-candles, which the monks held"
11668,CHAPTER XXIII,"over the roaring billows amid the storm of wind and rain, was really"
11669,CHAPTER XXIII,miraculous.
11670,CHAPTER XXIII,
11671,CHAPTER XXIII,"The Sicilian sea coast: a convent of monks: night: a most portentous,"
11672,CHAPTER XXIII,"unearthly storm: a vessel is wrecked contrary to all human expectation,"
11673,CHAPTER XXIII,"one man saves himself by his prodigious powers as a swimmer, aided by"
11674,CHAPTER XXIII,the peculiarity of his destination--
11675,CHAPTER XXIII,
11676,CHAPTER XXIII,"“PRIOR.------All, all did perish"
11677,CHAPTER XXIII,
11678,CHAPTER XXIII,"FIRST MONK.--Change, change those drenched weeds--"
11679,CHAPTER XXIII,
11680,CHAPTER XXIII,PRIOR.--I wist not of them--every soul did perish--
11681,CHAPTER XXIII,Enter third Monk hastily.
11682,CHAPTER XXIII,
11683,CHAPTER XXIII,"“THIRD MONK.--No, there was one did battle with the storm"
11684,CHAPTER XXIII,With careless desperate force; full many times
11685,CHAPTER XXIII,"His life was won and lost, as tho’ he recked not--"
11686,CHAPTER XXIII,"No hand did aid him, and he aided none--"
11687,CHAPTER XXIII,"Alone he breasted the broad wave, alone"
11688,CHAPTER XXIII,That man was saved.”
11689,CHAPTER XXIII,
11690,CHAPTER XXIII,"Well! This man is led in by the monks, supposed dripping wet, and to"
11691,CHAPTER XXIII,"very natural inquiries he either remains silent, or gives most brief and"
11692,CHAPTER XXIII,"surly answers, and after three or four of these half-line courtesies,"
11693,CHAPTER XXIII,"“dashing off the monks” who had saved him, he exclaims in the true"
11694,CHAPTER XXIII,sublimity of our modern misanthropic heroism--
11695,CHAPTER XXIII,
11696,CHAPTER XXIII,“Off! ye are men--there’s poison in your touch.
11697,CHAPTER XXIII,"But I must yield, for this” (what?) “hath left me strengthless.”"
11698,CHAPTER XXIII,
11699,CHAPTER XXIII,So end the three first scenes. In the next (the Castle of St.
11700,CHAPTER XXIII,"Aldobrand,) we find the servants there equally frightened with this"
11701,CHAPTER XXIII,"unearthly storm, though wherein it differed from other violent storms we"
11702,CHAPTER XXIII,"are not told, except that Hugo informs us, page 9--"
11703,CHAPTER XXIII,
11704,CHAPTER XXIII,"“PIET.--Hugo, well met. Does e’en thy age bear"
11705,CHAPTER XXIII,Memory of so terrible a storm?
11706,CHAPTER XXIII,
11707,CHAPTER XXIII,HUGO.--They have been frequent lately.
11708,CHAPTER XXIII,
11709,CHAPTER XXIII,PIET.--They are ever so in Sicily.
11710,CHAPTER XXIII,
11711,CHAPTER XXIII,HUGO.--So it is said. But storms when I was young
11712,CHAPTER XXIII,"Would still pass o’er like Nature’s fitful fevers,"
11713,CHAPTER XXIII,"And rendered all more wholesome. Now their rage,"
11714,CHAPTER XXIII,"Sent thus unseasonable and profitless,"
11715,CHAPTER XXIII,Speaks like the threats of heaven.”
11716,CHAPTER XXIII,
11717,CHAPTER XXIII,A most perplexing theory of Sicilian storms is this of old Hugo! and
11718,CHAPTER XXIII,"what is very remarkable, not apparently founded on any great familiarity"
11719,CHAPTER XXIII,of his own with this troublesome article. For when Pietro asserts the
11720,CHAPTER XXIII,"“ever more frequency” of tempests in Sicily, the old man professes to"
11721,CHAPTER XXIII,"know nothing more of the fact, but by hearsay. “So it is said.”--But why"
11722,CHAPTER XXIII,"he assumed this storm to be unseasonable, and on what he grounded"
11723,CHAPTER XXIII,"his prophecy, (for the storm is still in full fury), that it would be"
11724,CHAPTER XXIII,"profitless, and without the physical powers common to all other violent"
11725,CHAPTER XXIII,"sea-winds in purifying the atmosphere, we are left in the dark; as"
11726,CHAPTER XXIII,"well concerning the particular points in which he knew it, during its"
11727,CHAPTER XXIII,"continuance, to differ from those that he had been acquainted with in"
11728,CHAPTER XXIII,"his youth. We are at length introduced to the Lady Imogine, who,"
11729,CHAPTER XXIII,"we learn, had not rested “through” the night; not on account of the"
11730,CHAPTER XXIII,"tempest, for"
11731,CHAPTER XXIII,
11732,CHAPTER XXIII,"“Long ere the storm arose, her restless gestures"
11733,CHAPTER XXIII,Forbade all hope to see her blest with sleep.”
11734,CHAPTER XXIII,
11735,CHAPTER XXIII,"Sitting at a table, and looking at a portrait, she informs us--First,"
11736,CHAPTER XXIII,"that portrait-painters may make a portrait from memory,"
11737,CHAPTER XXIII,
11738,CHAPTER XXIII,“The limner’s art may trace the absent feature.”
11739,CHAPTER XXIII,
11740,CHAPTER XXIII,"For surely these words could never mean, that a painter may have a"
11741,CHAPTER XXIII,person sit to him who afterwards may leave the room or perhaps the
11742,CHAPTER XXIII,"country? Secondly, that a portrait-painter can enable a mourning lady"
11743,CHAPTER XXIII,"to possess a good likeness of her absent lover, but that the"
11744,CHAPTER XXIII,"portrait-painter cannot, and who shall--"
11745,CHAPTER XXIII,
11746,CHAPTER XXIII,“Restore the scenes in which they met and parted?”
11747,CHAPTER XXIII,
11748,CHAPTER XXIII,The natural answer would have been--Why the scene-painter to be sure!
11749,CHAPTER XXIII,But this unreasonable lady requires in addition sundry things to be
11750,CHAPTER XXIII,painted that have neither lines nor colours--
11751,CHAPTER XXIII,
11752,CHAPTER XXIII,"“The thoughts, the recollections, sweet and bitter,"
11753,CHAPTER XXIII,Or the Elysian dreams of lovers when they loved.”
11754,CHAPTER XXIII,
11755,CHAPTER XXIII,"Which last sentence must be supposed to mean; when they were present,"
11756,CHAPTER XXIII,"and making love to each other.--Then, if this portrait could speak, it"
11757,CHAPTER XXIII,would “acquit the faith of womankind.” How? Had she remained constant?
11758,CHAPTER XXIII,"No, she has been married to another man, whose wife she now is. How"
11759,CHAPTER XXIII,"then? Why, that, in spite of her marriage vow, she had continued to"
11760,CHAPTER XXIII,yearn and crave for her former lover--
11761,CHAPTER XXIII,
11762,CHAPTER XXIII,"“This has her body, that her mind:"
11763,CHAPTER XXIII,Which has the better bargain?”
11764,CHAPTER XXIII,
11765,CHAPTER XXIII,"The lover, however, was not contented with this precious arrangement, as"
11766,CHAPTER XXIII,we shall soon find. The lady proceeds to inform us that during the many
11767,CHAPTER XXIII,"years of their separation, there have happened in the different parts of"
11768,CHAPTER XXIII,"the world, a number of “such things;” even such, as in a course of"
11769,CHAPTER XXIII,"years always have, and till the Millennium, doubtless always will happen"
11770,CHAPTER XXIII,"somewhere or other. Yet this passage, both in language and in metre, is"
11771,CHAPTER XXIII,perhaps amongst the best parts of the play. The lady’s love companion
11772,CHAPTER XXIII,"and most esteemed attendant, Clotilda, now enters and explains this love"
11773,CHAPTER XXIII,"and esteem by proving herself a most passive and dispassionate listener,"
11774,CHAPTER XXIII,"as well as a brief and lucky querist, who asks by chance, questions that"
11775,CHAPTER XXIII,"we should have thought made for the very sake of the answers. In short,"
11776,CHAPTER XXIII,"she very much reminds us of those puppet-heroines, for whom the"
11777,CHAPTER XXIII,"showman contrives to dialogue without any skill in ventriloquism. This,"
11778,CHAPTER XXIII,"notwithstanding, is the best scene in the Play, and though crowded with"
11779,CHAPTER XXIII,"solecisms, corrupt diction, and offences against metre, would possess"
11780,CHAPTER XXIII,"merits sufficient to out-weigh them, if we could suspend the moral"
11781,CHAPTER XXIII,sense during the perusal. It tells well and passionately the preliminary
11782,CHAPTER XXIII,"circumstances, and thus overcomes the main difficulty of most first"
11783,CHAPTER XXIII,"acts, to wit, that of retrospective narration. It tells us of her having"
11784,CHAPTER XXIII,"been honourably addressed by a noble youth, of rank and fortune vastly"
11785,CHAPTER XXIII,"superior to her own: of their mutual love, heightened on her part"
11786,CHAPTER XXIII,by gratitude; of his loss of his sovereign’s favour; his disgrace;
11787,CHAPTER XXIII,"attainder; and flight; that he (thus degraded) sank into a vile ruffian,"
11788,CHAPTER XXIII,the chieftain of a murderous banditti; and that from the habitual
11789,CHAPTER XXIII,"indulgence of the most reprobate habits and ferocious passions, he had"
11790,CHAPTER XXIII,"become so changed, even in appearance, and features,"
11791,CHAPTER XXIII,
11792,CHAPTER XXIII,"“That she who bore him had recoiled from him,"
11793,CHAPTER XXIII,"Nor known the alien visage of her child,"
11794,CHAPTER XXIII,Yet still she (Imogine) lov’d him.”
11795,CHAPTER XXIII,
11796,CHAPTER XXIII,"She is compelled by the silent entreaties of a father, perishing with"
11797,CHAPTER XXIII,"“bitter shameful want on the cold earth,” to give her hand, with a heart"
11798,CHAPTER XXIII,"thus irrecoverably pre-engaged, to Lord Aldobrand, the enemy of her"
11799,CHAPTER XXIII,"lover, even to the very man who had baffled his ambitious schemes, and"
11800,CHAPTER XXIII,"was, at the present time, entrusted with the execution of the sentence"
11801,CHAPTER XXIII,"of death which had been passed on Bertram. Now, the proof of “woman’s"
11802,CHAPTER XXIII,"love,” so industriously held forth for the sympathy, if not for the"
11803,CHAPTER XXIII,"esteem of the audience, consists in this, that, though Bertram had"
11804,CHAPTER XXIII,"become a robber and a murderer by trade, a ruffian in manners, yea, with"
11805,CHAPTER XXIII,"form and features at which his own mother could not but “recoil,” yet"
11806,CHAPTER XXIII,"she (Lady Imogine) “the wife of a most noble, honoured Lord,” estimable"
11807,CHAPTER XXIII,"as a man, exemplary and affectionate as a husband, and the fond father"
11808,CHAPTER XXIII,"of her only child--that she, notwithstanding all this, striking her"
11809,CHAPTER XXIII,"heart, dares to say to it--"
11810,CHAPTER XXIII,
11811,CHAPTER XXIII,"“But thou art Bertram’s still, and Bertram’s ever.”"
11812,CHAPTER XXIII,
11813,CHAPTER XXIII,"A Monk now enters, and entreats in his Prior’s name for the wonted"
11814,CHAPTER XXIII,"hospitality, and “free noble usage” of the Castle of St. Aldobrand for"
11815,CHAPTER XXIII,"some wretched shipwrecked souls, and from this we learn, for the"
11816,CHAPTER XXIII,"first time, to our infinite surprise, that notwithstanding the"
11817,CHAPTER XXIII,"supernaturalness of the storm aforesaid, not only Bertram, but the whole"
11818,CHAPTER XXIII,"of his gang, had been saved, by what means we are left to conjecture,"
11819,CHAPTER XXIII,and can only conclude that they had all the same desperate swimming
11820,CHAPTER XXIII,"powers, and the same saving destiny as the hero, Bertram himself. So"
11821,CHAPTER XXIII,"ends the first act, and with it the tale of the events, both those with"
11822,CHAPTER XXIII,"which the tragedy begins, and those which had occurred previous to"
11823,CHAPTER XXIII,the date of its commencement. The second displays Bertram in disturbed
11824,CHAPTER XXIII,"sleep, which the Prior, who hangs over him, prefers calling a “starting"
11825,CHAPTER XXIII,"trance,” and with a strained voice, that would have awakened one of the"
11826,CHAPTER XXIII,"seven sleepers, observes to the audience--"
11827,CHAPTER XXIII,
11828,CHAPTER XXIII,“How the lip works! How the bare teeth do grind!
11829,CHAPTER XXIII,And beaded drops course [81] down his writhen brow!”
11830,CHAPTER XXIII,
11831,CHAPTER XXIII,The dramatic effect of which passage we not only concede to the admirers
11832,CHAPTER XXIII,"of this tragedy, but acknowledge the further advantages of preparing the"
11833,CHAPTER XXIII,"audience for the most surprising series of wry faces, proflated mouths,"
11834,CHAPTER XXIII,and lunatic gestures that were ever “launched” on an audience to “sear
11835,CHAPTER XXIII,the sense.” [82]
11836,CHAPTER XXIII,
11837,CHAPTER XXIII,“PRIOR.--I will awake him from this horrid trance. This is no
11838,CHAPTER XXIII,"natural sleep! Ho, wake thee, stranger!”"
11839,CHAPTER XXIII,
11840,CHAPTER XXIII,This is rather a whimsical application of the verb reflex we must
11841,CHAPTER XXIII,"confess, though we remember a similar transfer of the agent to the"
11842,CHAPTER XXIII,"patient in a manuscript tragedy, in which the Bertram of the piece,"
11843,CHAPTER XXIII,"prostrating a man with a single blow of his fist, exclaims--“Knock me"
11844,CHAPTER XXIII,"thee down, then ask thee if thou liv’st.” Well; the stranger obeys, and"
11845,CHAPTER XXIII,"whatever his sleep might have been, his waking was perfectly natural;"
11846,CHAPTER XXIII,for lethargy itself could not withstand the scolding Stentorship of
11847,CHAPTER XXIII,"Mr. Holland, the Prior. We next learn from the best authority, his own"
11848,CHAPTER XXIII,"confession, that the misanthropic hero, whose destiny was incompatible"
11849,CHAPTER XXIII,"with drowning, is Count Bertram, who not only reveals his past fortunes,"
11850,CHAPTER XXIII,"but avows with open atrocity, his Satanic hatred of Imogine’s lord, and"
11851,CHAPTER XXIII,"his frantick thirst of revenge; and so the raving character raves, and"
11852,CHAPTER XXIII,the scolding character scolds--and what else? Does not the Prior act?
11853,CHAPTER XXIII,Does he not send for a posse of constables or thief-takers to handcuff
11854,CHAPTER XXIII,"the villain, or take him either to Bedlam or Newgate? Nothing of the"
11855,CHAPTER XXIII,"kind; the author preserves the unity of character, and the scolding"
11856,CHAPTER XXIII,"Prior from first to last does nothing but scold, with the exception"
11857,CHAPTER XXIII,"indeed of the last scene of the last act, in which, with a most"
11858,CHAPTER XXIII,"surprising revolution, he whines, weeps, and kneels to the condemned"
11859,CHAPTER XXIII,"blaspheming assassin out of pure affection to the high-hearted man, the"
11860,CHAPTER XXIII,"sublimity of whose angel-sin rivals the star-bright apostate, (that"
11861,CHAPTER XXIII,"is, who was as proud as Lucifer, and as wicked as the Devil), and, “had"
11862,CHAPTER XXIII,"thrilled him,” (Prior Holland aforesaid), with wild admiration."
11863,CHAPTER XXIII,
11864,CHAPTER XXIII,"Accordingly in the very next scene, we have this tragic Macheath, with"
11865,CHAPTER XXIII,"his whole gang, in the Castle of St. Aldobrand, without any attempt"
11866,CHAPTER XXIII,"on the Prior’s part either to prevent him, or to put the mistress and"
11867,CHAPTER XXIII,servants of the Castle on their guard against their new inmates; though
11868,CHAPTER XXIII,"he (the Prior) knew, and confesses that he knew, that Bertram’s “fearful"
11869,CHAPTER XXIII,"mates” were assassins so habituated and naturalized to guilt, that--"
11870,CHAPTER XXIII,
11871,CHAPTER XXIII,"“When their drenched hold forsook both gold and gear,"
11872,CHAPTER XXIII,They griped their daggers with a murderer’s instinct;”
11873,CHAPTER XXIII,
11874,CHAPTER XXIII,"and though he also knew, that Bertram was the leader of a band whose"
11875,CHAPTER XXIII,"trade was blood. To the Castle however he goes, thus with the holy"
11876,CHAPTER XXIII,"Prior’s consent, if not with his assistance; and thither let us follow"
11877,CHAPTER XXIII,him.
11878,CHAPTER XXIII,
11879,CHAPTER XXIII,"No sooner is our hero safely housed in the Castle of St. Aldobrand, than"
11880,CHAPTER XXIII,"he attracts the notice of the lady and her confidante, by his “wild and"
11881,CHAPTER XXIII,"terrible dark eyes,” “muffled form,” “fearful form,” [83] “darkly wild,”"
11882,CHAPTER XXIII,"“proudly stern,” and the like common-place indefinites, seasoned by"
11883,CHAPTER XXIII,"merely verbal antitheses, and at best, copied with very slight change,"
11884,CHAPTER XXIII,"from the Conrade of Southey’s JOAN OF ARC. The lady Imogine, who has"
11885,CHAPTER XXIII,"been, (as is the case, she tells us, with all soft and solemn spirits,)"
11886,CHAPTER XXIII,"worshipping the moon on a terrace or rampart within view of the Castle,"
11887,CHAPTER XXIII,"insists on having an interview with our hero, and this too tete-a-tete."
11888,CHAPTER XXIII,"Would the reader learn why and wherefore the confidante is excluded, who"
11889,CHAPTER XXIII,"very properly remonstrates against such “conference, alone, at night,"
11890,CHAPTER XXIII,"with one who bears such fearful form;” the reason follows--“why,"
11891,CHAPTER XXIII,"therefore send him!” I say, follows, because the next line, “all things"
11892,CHAPTER XXIII,"of fear have lost their power over me,” is separated from the former"
11893,CHAPTER XXIII,"by a break or pause, and besides that it is a very poor answer to the"
11894,CHAPTER XXIII,"danger, is no answer at all to the gross indelicacy of this wilful"
11895,CHAPTER XXIII,"exposure. We must therefore regard it as a mere after-thought, that a"
11896,CHAPTER XXIII,"little softens the rudeness, but adds nothing to the weight, of that"
11897,CHAPTER XXIII,exquisite woman’s reason aforesaid. And so exit Clotilda and enter
11898,CHAPTER XXIII,"Bertram, who “stands without looking at her,” that is, with his lower"
11899,CHAPTER XXIII,"limbs forked, his arms akimbo, his side to the lady’s front, the whole"
11900,CHAPTER XXIII,figure resembling an inverted Y. He is soon however roused from the
11901,CHAPTER XXIII,"state surly to the state frantick, and then follow raving, yelling,"
11902,CHAPTER XXIII,"cursing, she fainting, he relenting, in runs Imogine’s child, squeaks"
11903,CHAPTER XXIII,"“mother!” He snatches it up, and with a “God bless thee, child! Bertram"
11904,CHAPTER XXIII,"has kissed thy child,”--the curtain drops. The third act is short, and"
11905,CHAPTER XXIII,short be our account of it. It introduces Lord St. Aldobrand on his road
11906,CHAPTER XXIII,"homeward, and next Imogine in the convent, confessing the foulness of"
11907,CHAPTER XXIII,"her heart to the Prior, who first indulges his old humour with a fit"
11908,CHAPTER XXIII,"of senseless scolding, then leaves her alone with her ruffian paramour,"
11909,CHAPTER XXIII,"with whom she makes at once an infamous appointment, and the curtain"
11910,CHAPTER XXIII,"drops, that it may be carried into act and consummation."
11911,CHAPTER XXIII,
11912,CHAPTER XXIII,I want words to describe the mingled horror and disgust with which I
11913,CHAPTER XXIII,"witnessed the opening of the fourth act, considering it as a melancholy"
11914,CHAPTER XXIII,proof of the depravation of the public mind. The shocking spirit of
11915,CHAPTER XXIII,jacobinism seemed no longer confined to politics. The familiarity with
11916,CHAPTER XXIII,"atrocious events and characters appeared to have poisoned the taste,"
11917,CHAPTER XXIII,"even where it had not directly disorganized the moral principles, and"
11918,CHAPTER XXIII,"left the feelings callous to all the mild appeals, and craving alone for"
11919,CHAPTER XXIII,the grossest and most outrageous stimulants. The very fact then present
11920,CHAPTER XXIII,"to our senses, that a British audience could remain passive under such"
11921,CHAPTER XXIII,"an insult to common decency, nay, receive with a thunder of applause, a"
11922,CHAPTER XXIII,human being supposed to have come reeking from the consummation of this
11923,CHAPTER XXIII,"complex foulness and baseness, these and the like reflections so pressed"
11924,CHAPTER XXIII,"as with the weight of lead upon my heart, that actor, author, and"
11925,CHAPTER XXIII,"tragedy would have been forgotten, had it not been for a plain elderly"
11926,CHAPTER XXIII,"man sitting beside me, who, with a very serious face, that at once"
11927,CHAPTER XXIII,"expressed surprise and aversion, touched my elbow, and, pointing to"
11928,CHAPTER XXIII,"the actor, said to me in a half-whisper--“Do you see that little fellow"
11929,CHAPTER XXIII,there? he has just been committing adultery!” Somewhat relieved by the
11930,CHAPTER XXIII,"laugh which this droll address occasioned, I forced back my attention"
11931,CHAPTER XXIII,"to the stage sufficiently to learn, that Bertram is recovered from a"
11932,CHAPTER XXIII,"transient fit of remorse by the information, that St. Aldobrand was"
11933,CHAPTER XXIII,"commissioned (to do, what every honest man must have done without"
11934,CHAPTER XXIII,"commission, if he did his duty) to seize him and deliver him to the"
11935,CHAPTER XXIII,"just vengeance of the law; an information which, (as he had long known"
11936,CHAPTER XXIII,"himself to be an attainted traitor and proclaimed outlaw, and not only"
11937,CHAPTER XXIII,"a trader in blood himself, but notoriously the Captain of a gang of"
11938,CHAPTER XXIII,"thieves, pirates, and assassins), assuredly could not have been new to"
11939,CHAPTER XXIII,"him. It is this, however, which alone and instantly restores him to"
11940,CHAPTER XXIII,"his accustomed state of raving, blasphemy, and nonsense. Next follows"
11941,CHAPTER XXIII,"Imogine’s constrained interview with her injured husband, and his sudden"
11942,CHAPTER XXIII,"departure again, all in love and kindness, in order to attend the feast"
11943,CHAPTER XXIII,"of St. Anselm at the convent. This was, it must be owned, a very strange"
11944,CHAPTER XXIII,engagement for so tender a husband to make within a few minutes after so
11945,CHAPTER XXIII,long an absence. But first his lady has told him that she has “a vow
11946,CHAPTER XXIII,"on her,” and wishes “that black perdition may gulf her perjured"
11947,CHAPTER XXIII,"soul,”--(Note: she is lying at the very time)--if she ascends his bed,"
11948,CHAPTER XXIII,"till her penance is accomplished. How, therefore, is the poor husband to"
11949,CHAPTER XXIII,"amuse himself in this interval of her penance? But do not be distressed,"
11950,CHAPTER XXIII,"reader, on account of the St. Aldobrand’s absence! As the author has"
11951,CHAPTER XXIII,"contrived to send him out of the house, when a husband would be in his,"
11952,CHAPTER XXIII,"and the lover’s way, so he will doubtless not be at a loss to bring him"
11953,CHAPTER XXIII,back again as soon as he is wanted. Well! the husband gone in on the one
11954,CHAPTER XXIII,"side, out pops the lover from the other, and for the fiendish purpose of"
11955,CHAPTER XXIII,"harrowing up the soul of his wretched accomplice in guilt, by announcing"
11956,CHAPTER XXIII,"to her, with most brutal and blasphemous execrations, his fixed and"
11957,CHAPTER XXIII,deliberate resolve to assassinate her husband; all this too is for no
11958,CHAPTER XXIII,"discoverable purpose on the part of the author, but that of introducing"
11959,CHAPTER XXIII,"a series of super-tragic starts, pauses, screams, struggling,"
11960,CHAPTER XXIII,"dagger-throwing, falling on the ground, starting up again wildly,"
11961,CHAPTER XXIII,"swearing, outcries for help, falling again on the ground, rising again,"
11962,CHAPTER XXIII,"faintly tottering towards the door, and, to end the scene, a most"
11963,CHAPTER XXIII,"convenient fainting fit of our lady’s, just in time to give Bertram an"
11964,CHAPTER XXIII,"opportunity of seeking the object of his hatred, before she alarms the"
11965,CHAPTER XXIII,"house, which indeed she has had full time to have done before, but that"
11966,CHAPTER XXIII,the author rather chose she should amuse herself and the audience by the
11967,CHAPTER XXIII,"above-described ravings and startings. She recovers slowly, and to her"
11968,CHAPTER XXIII,"enter, Clotilda, the confidante and mother confessor; then commences,"
11969,CHAPTER XXIII,"what in theatrical language is called the madness, but which the author"
11970,CHAPTER XXIII,"more accurately entitles, delirium, it appearing indeed a sort of"
11971,CHAPTER XXIII,"intermittent fever with fits of lightheadedness off and on, whenever"
11972,CHAPTER XXIII,occasion and stage effect happen to call for it. A convenient return
11973,CHAPTER XXIII,"of the storm, (we told the reader before-hand how it would be), had"
11974,CHAPTER XXIII,changed--
11975,CHAPTER XXIII,
11976,CHAPTER XXIII,"“The rivulet, that bathed the convent walls,"
11977,CHAPTER XXIII,Into a foaming flood: upon its brink
11978,CHAPTER XXIII,The Lord and his small train do stand appalled.
11979,CHAPTER XXIII,With torch and bell from their high battlements
11980,CHAPTER XXIII,The monks do summon to the pass in vain;
11981,CHAPTER XXIII,He must return to-night.”
11982,CHAPTER XXIII,
11983,CHAPTER XXIII,"Talk of the Devil, and his horns appear, says the proverb and sure"
11984,CHAPTER XXIII,"enough, within ten lines of the exit of the messenger, sent to stop him,"
11985,CHAPTER XXIII,the arrival of Lord St. Aldobrand is announced. Bertram’s ruffian band
11986,CHAPTER XXIII,"now enter, and range themselves across the stage, giving fresh cause for"
11987,CHAPTER XXIII,"Imogine’s screams and madness. St. Aldobrand, having received his mortal"
11988,CHAPTER XXIII,"wound behind the scenes, totters in to welter in his blood, and to die"
11989,CHAPTER XXIII,at the feet of this double-damned adultress.
11990,CHAPTER XXIII,
11991,CHAPTER XXIII,"Of her, as far as she is concerned in this fourth act, we have two"
11992,CHAPTER XXIII,"additional points to notice: first, the low cunning and Jesuitical trick"
11993,CHAPTER XXIII,"with which she deludes her husband into words of forgiveness, which he"
11994,CHAPTER XXIII,"himself does not understand; and secondly, that everywhere she is made"
11995,CHAPTER XXIII,"the object of interest and sympathy, and it is not the author’s fault,"
11996,CHAPTER XXIII,"if, at any moment, she excites feelings less gentle, than those we are"
11997,CHAPTER XXIII,accustomed to associate with the self-accusations of a sincere religious
11998,CHAPTER XXIII,penitent. And did a British audience endure all this?--They received
11999,CHAPTER XXIII,"it with plaudits, which, but for the rivalry of the carts and hackney"
12000,CHAPTER XXIII,"coaches, might have disturbed the evening-prayers of the scanty week"
12001,CHAPTER XXIII,day congregation at St. Paul’s cathedral.
12002,CHAPTER XXIII,
12003,CHAPTER XXIII,"Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis."
12004,CHAPTER XXIII,
12005,CHAPTER XXIII,"Of the fifth act, the only thing noticeable, (for rant and nonsense,"
12006,CHAPTER XXIII,"though abundant as ever, have long before the last act become things of"
12007,CHAPTER XXIII,"course,) is the profane representation of the high altar in a chapel,"
12008,CHAPTER XXIII,with all the vessels and other preparations for the holy sacrament. A
12009,CHAPTER XXIII,hymn is actually sung on the stage by the chorister boys! For the
12010,CHAPTER XXIII,"rest, Imogine, who now and then talks deliriously, but who is always"
12011,CHAPTER XXIII,"light-headed as far as her gown and hair can make her so, wanders about"
12012,CHAPTER XXIII,in dark woods with cavern-rocks and precipices in the back-scene; and a
12013,CHAPTER XXIII,"number of mute dramatis personae move in and out continually, for"
12014,CHAPTER XXIII,"whose presence, there is always at least this reason, that they afford"
12015,CHAPTER XXIII,"something to be seen, by that very large part of a Drury Lane audience"
12016,CHAPTER XXIII,"who have small chance of hearing a word. She had, it appears, taken her"
12017,CHAPTER XXIII,"child with her, but what becomes of the child, whether she murdered"
12018,CHAPTER XXIII,"it or not, nobody can tell, nobody can learn; it was a riddle at the"
12019,CHAPTER XXIII,"representation, and after a most attentive perusal of the Play, a riddle"
12020,CHAPTER XXIII,it remains.
12021,CHAPTER XXIII,
12022,CHAPTER XXIII,"“No more I know, I wish I did,"
12023,CHAPTER XXIII,And I would tell it all to you;
12024,CHAPTER XXIII,For what became of this poor child
12025,CHAPTER XXIII,There’s none that ever knew.”
12026,CHAPTER XXIII,
12027,CHAPTER XXIII,Our whole information [84] is derived from the following words--
12028,CHAPTER XXIII,
12029,CHAPTER XXIII,“PRIOR.--Where is thy child?
12030,CHAPTER XXIII,
12031,CHAPTER XXIII,CLOTIL.--(Pointing to the cavern into which she has looked)
12032,CHAPTER XXIII,Oh he lies cold within his cavern-tomb!
12033,CHAPTER XXIII,Why dost thou urge her with the horrid theme?
12034,CHAPTER XXIII,
12035,CHAPTER XXIII,"PRIOR.--(who will not, the reader may observe, be disappointed of"
12036,CHAPTER XXIII,his dose of scolding)
12037,CHAPTER XXIII,"It was to make (query wake) one living cord o’ th’ heart,"
12038,CHAPTER XXIII,"And I will try, tho’ my own breaks at it."
12039,CHAPTER XXIII,Where is thy child?
12040,CHAPTER XXIII,
12041,CHAPTER XXIII,IMOG.--(with a frantic laugh) The forest fiend hath snatched him--
12042,CHAPTER XXIII,He (who? the fiend or the child?) rides the night-mare thro’ the
12043,CHAPTER XXIII,wizard woods.”
12044,CHAPTER XXIII,
12045,CHAPTER XXIII,Now these two lines consist in a senseless plagiarism from the
12046,CHAPTER XXIII,"counterfeited madness of Edgar in Lear, who, in imitation of the"
12047,CHAPTER XXIII,"gypsy incantations, puns on the old word mair, a hag; and the no less"
12048,CHAPTER XXIII,"senseless adoption of Dryden’s forest fiend, and the wisard stream by"
12049,CHAPTER XXIII,"which Milton, in his Lycidas, so finely characterizes the spreading"
12050,CHAPTER XXIII,"Deva, fabulosus amnis. Observe too these images stand unique in the"
12051,CHAPTER XXIII,"speeches of Imogine, without the slightest resemblance to anything she"
12052,CHAPTER XXIII,says before or after. But we are weary. The characters in this act
12053,CHAPTER XXIII,"frisk about, here, there, and every where, as teasingly as the Jack"
12054,CHAPTER XXIII,"o’ Lantern-lights which mischievous boys, from across a narrow street,"
12055,CHAPTER XXIII,throw with a looking-glass on the faces of their opposite neighbours.
12056,CHAPTER XXIII,"Bertram disarmed, outheroding Charles de Moor in the Robbers, befaces"
12057,CHAPTER XXIII,"the collected knights of St. Anselm, (all in complete armour) and so, by"
12058,CHAPTER XXIII,"pure dint of black looks, he outdares them into passive poltroons. The"
12059,CHAPTER XXIII,"sudden revolution in the Prior’s manners we have before noticed, and"
12060,CHAPTER XXIII,"it is indeed so outre, that a number of the audience imagined a great"
12061,CHAPTER XXIII,"secret was to come out, viz.: that the Prior was one of the many"
12062,CHAPTER XXIII,"instances of a youthful sinner metamorphosed into an old scold, and that"
12063,CHAPTER XXIII,this Bertram would appear at last to be his son. Imogine re-appears at
12064,CHAPTER XXIII,"the convent, and dies of her own accord. Bertram stabs himself, and dies"
12065,CHAPTER XXIII,"by her side, and that the play may conclude as it began, to wit, in"
12066,CHAPTER XXIII,"a superfetation of blasphemy upon nonsense, because he had snatched"
12067,CHAPTER XXIII,"a sword from a despicable coward, who retreats in terror when it is"
12068,CHAPTER XXIII,"pointed towards him in sport; this felo de se, and thief-captain--this"
12069,CHAPTER XXIII,"loathsome and leprous confluence of robbery, adultery, murder, and"
12070,CHAPTER XXIII,"cowardly assassination,--this monster, whose best deed is, the having"
12071,CHAPTER XXIII,"saved his betters from the degradation of hanging him, by turning Jack"
12072,CHAPTER XXIII,Ketch to himself; first recommends the charitable Monks and holy Prior
12073,CHAPTER XXIII,"to pray for his soul, and then has the folly and impudence to exclaim--"
12074,CHAPTER XXIII,
12075,CHAPTER XXIII,"“I die no felon’s death,"

12086,CONCLUSION,"It sometimes happens that we are punished for our faults by incidents,"
12087,CONCLUSION,in the causation of which these faults had no share: and this I have
12088,CONCLUSION,always felt the severest punishment. The wound indeed is of the same
12089,CONCLUSION,"dimensions; but the edges are jagged, and there is a dull underpain"
12090,CONCLUSION,that survives the smart which it had aggravated. For there is always a
12091,CONCLUSION,consolatory feeling that accompanies the sense of a proportion between
12092,CONCLUSION,antecedents and consequents. The sense of Before and After becomes both
12093,CONCLUSION,"intelligible and intellectual when, and only when, we contemplate the"
12094,CONCLUSION,"succession in the relations of Cause and Effect, which, like the two"
12095,CONCLUSION,poles of the magnet manifest the being and unity of the one power by
12096,CONCLUSION,"relative opposites, and give, as it were, a substratum of permanence, of"
12097,CONCLUSION,"identity, and therefore of reality, to the shadowy flux of Time. It is"
12098,CONCLUSION,Eternity revealing itself in the phaenomena of Time: and the perception
12099,CONCLUSION,and acknowledgment of the proportionality and appropriateness of the
12100,CONCLUSION,"Present to the Past, prove to the afflicted Soul, that it has not yet"
12101,CONCLUSION,"been deprived of the sight of God, that it can still recognise the"
12102,CONCLUSION,"effective presence of a Father, though through a darkened glass and a"
12103,CONCLUSION,"turbid atmosphere, though of a Father that is chastising it. And for"
12104,CONCLUSION,"this cause, doubtless, are we so framed in mind, and even so organized"
12105,CONCLUSION,"in brain and nerve, that all confusion is painful. It is within the"
12106,CONCLUSION,"experience of many medical practitioners, that a patient, with strange"
12107,CONCLUSION,"and unusual symptoms of disease, has been more distressed in mind, more"
12108,CONCLUSION,"wretched, from the fact of being unintelligible to himself and others,"
12109,CONCLUSION,"than from the pain or danger of the disease: nay, that the patient"
12110,CONCLUSION,"has received the most solid comfort, and resumed a genial and enduring"
12111,CONCLUSION,"cheerfulness, from some new symptom or product, that had at once"
12112,CONCLUSION,"determined the name and nature of his complaint, and rendered it an"
12113,CONCLUSION,intelligible effect of an intelligible cause: even though the discovery
12114,CONCLUSION,did at the same moment preclude all hope of restoration. Hence the
12115,CONCLUSION,"mystic theologians, whose delusions we may more confidently hope to"
12116,CONCLUSION,"separate from their actual intuitions, when we condescend to read their"
12117,CONCLUSION,"works without the presumption that whatever our fancy, (always the ape,"
12118,CONCLUSION,"and too often the adulterator and counterfeit of our memory,) has not"
12119,CONCLUSION,"made or cannot make a picture of, must be nonsense,--hence, I say, the"
12120,CONCLUSION,Mystics have joined in representing the state of the reprobate spirits
12121,CONCLUSION,"as a dreadful dream in which there is no sense of reality, not even of"
12122,CONCLUSION,"the pangs they are enduring--an eternity without time, and as it were"
12123,CONCLUSION,below it--God present without manifestation of his presence. But these
12124,CONCLUSION,"are depths, which we dare not linger over. Let us turn to an instance"
12125,CONCLUSION,"more on a level with the ordinary sympathies of mankind. Here then, and"
12126,CONCLUSION,"in this same healing influence of Light and distinct Beholding, we may"
12127,CONCLUSION,"detect the final cause of that instinct which, in the great majority of"
12128,CONCLUSION,"instances, leads, and almost compels the Afflicted to communicate their"
12129,CONCLUSION,sorrows. Hence too flows the alleviation that results from “opening out
12130,CONCLUSION,our griefs:” which are thus presented in distinguishable forms instead
12131,CONCLUSION,"of the mist, through which whatever is shapeless becomes magnified and"
12132,CONCLUSION,"(literally) enormous. Casimir, in the fifth Ode of his third Book, has"
12133,CONCLUSION,happily [85] expressed this thought.

12153,CONCLUSION,"any complaints or explanations, with which, as readers, they have little"
12154,CONCLUSION,"or no concern. It may suffice, (for the present at least,) to declare,"
12155,CONCLUSION,that the causes that have delayed the publication of these volumes for
12156,CONCLUSION,"so long a period after they had been printed off, were not connected"
12157,CONCLUSION,with any neglect of my own; and that they would form an instructive
12158,CONCLUSION,"comment on the chapter concerning authorship as a trade, addressed to"
12159,CONCLUSION,young men of genius in the first volume of this work. I remember
12160,CONCLUSION,the ludicrous effect produced on my mind by the fast sentence of
12161,CONCLUSION,"an auto-biography, which, happily for the writer, was as meagre in"
12162,CONCLUSION,incidents as it is well possible for the life of an individual to
12163,CONCLUSION,"be--“The eventful life which I am about to record, from the hour"
12164,CONCLUSION,"in which I rose into existence on this planet, etc.” Yet when,"
12165,CONCLUSION,"notwithstanding this warning example of self-importance before me, I"
12166,CONCLUSION,"review my own life, I cannot refrain from applying the same epithet to"
12167,CONCLUSION,"it, and with more than ordinary emphasis--and no private feeling, that"
12168,CONCLUSION,"affected myself only, should prevent me from publishing the same, (for"
12169,CONCLUSION,"write it I assuredly shall, should life and leisure be granted me,)"
12170,CONCLUSION,"if continued reflection should strengthen my present belief, that my"
12171,CONCLUSION,history would add its contingent to the enforcement of one important
12172,CONCLUSION,"truth, to wit, that we must not only love our neighbours as ourselves,"
12173,CONCLUSION,but ourselves likewise as our neighbours; and that we can do neither
12174,CONCLUSION,unless we love God above both.

12178,CONCLUSION,Not one spurn to the grave of their friends’ gift?
12179,CONCLUSION,
12180,CONCLUSION,"Strange as the delusion may appear, yet it is most true, that three"
12181,CONCLUSION,years ago I did not know or believe that I had an enemy in the world:
12182,CONCLUSION,"and now even my strongest sensations of gratitude are mingled with fear,"
12183,CONCLUSION,"and I reproach myself for being too often disposed to ask,--Have I one"
12184,CONCLUSION,friend?--During the many years which intervened between the composition
12185,CONCLUSION,"and the publication of the CHRISTABEL, it became almost as well known"
12186,CONCLUSION,among literary men as if it had been on common sale; the same references
12187,CONCLUSION,"were made to it, and the same liberties taken with it, even to the very"
12188,CONCLUSION,names of the imaginary persons in the poem. From almost all of our
12189,CONCLUSION,"most celebrated poets, and from some with whom I had no personal"
12190,CONCLUSION,"acquaintance, I either received or heard of expressions of admiration"
12191,CONCLUSION,"that, (I can truly say,) appeared to myself utterly disproportionate"
12192,CONCLUSION,"to a work, that pretended to be nothing more than a common Faery Tale."
12193,CONCLUSION,"Many, who had allowed no merit to my other poems, whether printed or"
12194,CONCLUSION,"manuscript, and who have frankly told me as much, uniformly made an"
12195,CONCLUSION,exception in favour of the CHRISTABEL and the poem entitled LOVE. Year
12196,CONCLUSION,"after year, and in societies of the most different kinds, I had been"
12197,CONCLUSION,"entreated to recite it and the result was still the same in all, and"
12198,CONCLUSION,altogether different in this respect from the effect produced by the
12199,CONCLUSION,occasional recitation of any other poems I had composed.--This before
12200,CONCLUSION,"the publication. And since then, with very few exceptions, I have heard"
12201,CONCLUSION,"nothing but abuse, and this too in a spirit of bitterness at least as"
12202,CONCLUSION,"disproportionate to the pretensions of the poem, had it been the most"
12203,CONCLUSION,"pitiably below mediocrity, as the previous eulogies, and far more"
12204,CONCLUSION,"inexplicable.--This may serve as a warning to authors, that in their"
12205,CONCLUSION,"calculations on the probable reception of a poem, they must subtract"
12206,CONCLUSION,"to a large amount from the panegyric, which may have encouraged them to"
12207,CONCLUSION,"publish it, however unsuspicious and however various the sources of this"
12208,CONCLUSION,"panegyric may have been. And, first, allowances must be made for private"
12209,CONCLUSION,"enmity, of the very existence of which they had perhaps entertained no"
12210,CONCLUSION,suspicion--for personal enmity behind the mask of anonymous criticism:
12211,CONCLUSION,secondly for the necessity of a certain proportion of abuse and ridicule
12212,CONCLUSION,"in a Review, in order to make it saleable, in consequence of which, if"
12213,CONCLUSION,"they have no friends behind the scenes, the chance must needs be against"
12214,CONCLUSION,"them; but lastly and chiefly, for the excitement and temporary sympathy"
12215,CONCLUSION,"of feeling, which the recitation of the poem by an admirer, especially"
12216,CONCLUSION,"if he be at once a warm admirer and a man of acknowledged celebrity,"
12217,CONCLUSION,calls forth in the audience. For this is really a species of animal
12218,CONCLUSION,"magnetism, in which the enkindling reciter, by perpetual comment of"
12219,CONCLUSION,"looks and tones, lends his own will and apprehensive faculty to his"
12220,CONCLUSION,auditors. They live for the time within the dilated sphere of his
12221,CONCLUSION,"intellectual being. It is equally possible, though not equally common,"
12222,CONCLUSION,"that a reader left to himself should sink below the poem, as that"
12223,CONCLUSION,the poem left to itself should flag beneath the feelings of the
12224,CONCLUSION,"reader.--But, in my own instance, I had the additional misfortune of"
12225,CONCLUSION,"having been gossiped about, as devoted to metaphysics, and worse than"
12226,CONCLUSION,"all, to a system incomparably nearer to the visionary flights of Plato,"
12227,CONCLUSION,"and even to the jargon of the Mystics, than to the established tenets"
12228,CONCLUSION,of Locke. Whatever therefore appeared with my name was condemned
12229,CONCLUSION,"beforehand, as predestined metaphysics. In a dramatic poem, which had"
12230,CONCLUSION,been submitted by me to a gentleman of great influence in the theatrical
12231,CONCLUSION,"world, occurred the following passage:--"
12232,CONCLUSION,
12233,CONCLUSION,“O we are querulous creatures! Little less
12234,CONCLUSION,Than all things can suffice to make us happy:
12235,CONCLUSION,And little more than nothing is enough
12236,CONCLUSION,To make us wretched.”
12237,CONCLUSION,
12238,CONCLUSION,"Aye, here now! (exclaimed the critic) here come Coleridge’s metaphysics!"
12239,CONCLUSION,"And the very same motive (that is, not that the lines were unfit for the"
12240,CONCLUSION,present state of our immense theatres; but that they were metaphysics
12241,CONCLUSION,[87]) was assigned elsewhere for the rejection of the two following
12242,CONCLUSION,"passages. The first is spoken in answer to a usurper, who had rested his"
12243,CONCLUSION,"plea on the circumstance, that he had been chosen by the acclamations of"
12244,CONCLUSION,the people.--
12245,CONCLUSION,
12246,CONCLUSION,"“What people? How convened? or, if convened,"
12247,CONCLUSION,Must not the magic power that charms together
12248,CONCLUSION,"Millions of men in council, needs have power"
12249,CONCLUSION,"To win or wield them? Rather, O far rather"
12250,CONCLUSION,"Shout forth thy titles to yon circling mountains,"
12251,CONCLUSION,And with a thousand-fold reverberation
12252,CONCLUSION,"Make the rocks flatter thee, and the volleying air,"
12253,CONCLUSION,"Unbribed, shout back to thee, King Emerick!"
12254,CONCLUSION,"By wholesome laws to embank the sovereign power,"
12255,CONCLUSION,"To deepen by restraint, and by prevention"
12256,CONCLUSION,Of lawless will to amass and guide the flood
12257,CONCLUSION,"In its majestic channel, is man’s task"
12258,CONCLUSION,And the true patriot’s glory! In all else
12259,CONCLUSION,"Men safelier trust to Heaven, than to themselves"
12260,CONCLUSION,When least themselves: even in those whirling crowds
12261,CONCLUSION,"Where folly is contagious, and too oft"
12262,CONCLUSION,"Even wise men leave their better sense at home,"
12263,CONCLUSION,"To chide and wonder at them, when returned.”"

12315,CONCLUSION,premising only that I was speaking exclusively of miracles worked for
12316,CONCLUSION,the outward senses of men. “It was only to overthrow the usurpation
12317,CONCLUSION,"exercised in and through the senses, that the senses were miraculously"
12318,CONCLUSION,appealed to. REASON AND RELIGION ARE THEIR OWN EVIDENCE. The natural sun

12330,CONCLUSION,"cessation of the latter, we tempt God, and merit the same reply which"
12331,CONCLUSION,our Lord gave to the Pharisees on a like occasion.”
12332,CONCLUSION,
12333,CONCLUSION,In the sermon and the notes both the historical truth and the necessity
12334,CONCLUSION,of the miracles are strongly and frequently asserted. “The testimony
12335,CONCLUSION,"of books of history (that is, relatively to the signs and wonders,"
12336,CONCLUSION,with which Christ came) is one of the strong and stately pillars of the
12337,CONCLUSION,"church: but it is not the foundation!” Instead, therefore, of defending"
12338,CONCLUSION,"myself, which I could easily effect by a series of passages, expressing"
12339,CONCLUSION,"the same opinion, from the Fathers and the most eminent Protestant"
12340,CONCLUSION,"Divines, from the Reformation to the Revolution, I shall merely state"
12341,CONCLUSION,"what my belief is, concerning the true evidences of Christianity. 1."
12342,CONCLUSION,"Its consistency with right Reason, I consider as the outer court of the"
12343,CONCLUSION,"temple--the common area, within which it stands. 2. The miracles, with"
12344,CONCLUSION,"and through which the Religion was first revealed and attested, I regard"
12345,CONCLUSION,"as the steps, the vestibule, and the portal of the temple. 3. The"
12346,CONCLUSION,"sense, the inward feeling, in the soul of each believer of its exceeding"
12347,CONCLUSION,"desirableness--the experience, that he needs something, joined with the"
12348,CONCLUSION,"strong foretokening, that the redemption and the graces propounded to"
12349,CONCLUSION,us in Christ are what he needs--this I hold to be the true foundation of
12350,CONCLUSION,the spiritual edifice. With the strong a priori probability that flows
12351,CONCLUSION,"in from 1 and 3 on the correspondent historical evidence of 2, no man"
12352,CONCLUSION,"can refuse or neglect to make the experiment without guilt. But, 4, it"
12353,CONCLUSION,is the experience derived from a practical conformity to the conditions
12354,CONCLUSION,of the Gospel--it is the opening eye; the dawning light: the terrors and
12355,CONCLUSION,the promises of spiritual growth; the blessedness of loving God as
12356,CONCLUSION,"God, the nascent sense of sin hated as sin, and of the incapability of"
12357,CONCLUSION,attaining to either without Christ; it is the sorrow that still rises
12358,CONCLUSION,up from beneath and the consolation that meets it from above; the
12359,CONCLUSION,bosom treacheries of the principal in the warfare and the exceeding
12360,CONCLUSION,"faithfulness and long-suffering of the uninteresting ally;--in a word,"
12361,CONCLUSION,"it is the actual trial of the faith in Christ, with its accompaniments"
12362,CONCLUSION,"and results, that must form the arched roof, and the faith itself is the"
12363,CONCLUSION,"completing key-stone. In order to an efficient belief in Christianity,"
12364,CONCLUSION,"a man must have been a Christian, and this is the seeming argumentum"
12365,CONCLUSION,"in circulo, incident to all spiritual Truths, to every subject not"
12366,CONCLUSION,"presentable under the forms of Time and Space, as long as we attempt to"
12367,CONCLUSION,master by the reflex acts of the Understanding what we can only know by
12368,CONCLUSION,"the act of becoming. Do the will of my Father, and ye shall know whether"
12369,CONCLUSION,I am of God. These four evidences I believe to have been and still to
12370,CONCLUSION,"be, for the world, for the whole Church, all necessary, all equally"
12371,CONCLUSION,"necessary: but at present, and for the majority of Christians born in"
12372,CONCLUSION,"Christian countries, I believe the third and the fourth evidences to"
12373,CONCLUSION,"be the most operative, not as superseding but as involving a glad"
12374,CONCLUSION,"undoubting faith in the two former. Credidi, ideoque intellexi, appears"
12375,CONCLUSION,"to me the dictate equally of Philosophy and Religion, even as I"
12376,CONCLUSION,"believe Redemption to be the antecedent of Sanctification, and not its"
12377,CONCLUSION,consequent. All spiritual predicates may be construed indifferently as
12378,CONCLUSION,"modes of Action or as states of Being, Thus Holiness and Blessedness"
12379,CONCLUSION,"are the same idea, now seen in relation to act and now to existence."
12380,CONCLUSION,The ready belief which has been yielded to the slander of my “potential
12381,CONCLUSION,"infidelity,” I attribute in part to the openness with which I have"
12382,CONCLUSION,"avowed my doubts, whether the heavy interdict, under which the name of"
12383,CONCLUSION,"Benedict Spinoza lies, is merited on the whole or to the whole extent."
12384,CONCLUSION,"Be this as it may, I wish, however, that I could find in the books of"
12385,CONCLUSION,"philosophy, theoretical or moral, which are alone recommended to the"
12386,CONCLUSION,"present students of theology in our established schools, a few passages"
12387,CONCLUSION,"as thoroughly Pauline, as completely accordant with the doctrines of the"
12388,CONCLUSION,"Established Church, as the following sentences in the concluding page"
12389,CONCLUSION,"of Spinoza’s Ethics. Deinde quo mens hoc amore divino, seu beatitudine"
12390,CONCLUSION,"magis gaudet, eo plus intelligit, hoc est, eo majorem in affectus habet"
12391,CONCLUSION,"potentiam, et eo minus ab affectibus, qui mali sunt, patitur; atque adeo"
12392,CONCLUSION,"ex eo, quod mens hoc amore divino, seu beatitudine gaudet, potestatem"

12395,CONCLUSION,"quia affectus coercuit, sed contra potestas libidines coercendi ex ipsa"
12396,CONCLUSION,beatitudine oritur.
12397,CONCLUSION,
12398,CONCLUSION,"With regard to the Unitarians, it has been shamelessly asserted, that"
12399,CONCLUSION,"I have denied them to be Christians. God forbid! For how should I know,"
12400,CONCLUSION,"what the piety of the heart may be, or what quantum of error in the"
12401,CONCLUSION,understanding may consist with a saving faith in the intentions and
12402,CONCLUSION,actual dispositions of the whole moral being in any one individual?
12403,CONCLUSION,Never will God reject a soul that sincerely loves him: be his
12404,CONCLUSION,speculative opinions what they may: and whether in any given instance
12405,CONCLUSION,"certain opinions, be they unbelief, or misbelief, are compatible with a"
12406,CONCLUSION,"sincere love of God, God can only know.--But this I have said, and shall"
12407,CONCLUSION,"continue to say: that if the doctrines, the sum of which I believe to"
12408,CONCLUSION,"constitute the truth in Christ, be Christianity, then Unitarianism"
12409,CONCLUSION,"is not, and vice versa: and that, in speaking theologically and"
12410,CONCLUSION,"impersonally, i.e. of Psilanthropism and Theanthropism as schemes of"
12411,CONCLUSION,"belief, without reference to individuals, who profess either the one or"
12412,CONCLUSION,"the other, it will be absurd to use a different language as long as it"
12413,CONCLUSION,"is the dictate of common sense, that two opposites cannot properly be"
12414,CONCLUSION,called by the same name. I should feel no offence if a Unitarian applied
12415,CONCLUSION,"the same to me, any more than if he were to say, that two and two being"

12453,FOOTNOTES,[Footnote 1: The authority of Milton and Shakespeare may be usefully pointed out
12454,FOOTNOTES,to young authors. In the Comus and other early poems of Milton there
12455,FOOTNOTES,is a superfluity of double epithets; while in the Paradise Lost we find

12459,FOOTNOTES,Hamlet of our great Dramatist. The rule for the admission of double
12460,FOOTNOTES,epithets seems to be this: either that they should be already
12461,FOOTNOTES,"denizens of our language, such as blood-stained, terror-stricken,"
12462,FOOTNOTES,"self-applauding: or when a new epithet, or one found in books only, is"
12463,FOOTNOTES,"hazarded, that it, at least, be one word, not two words made one by mere"
12464,FOOTNOTES,"virtue of the printers hyphen. A language which, like the English,"

12612,SONNET III,"illustrations of the same thoughts, was addressed to very numerous, and"
12613,SONNET III,"I need not add, respectable audiences at the Royal institution, before"
12614,SONNET III,Mr. Schlegel gave his lectures on the same subjects at Vienna.]
12615,SONNET III,
12616,SONNET III,"[Footnote 10: In the course of one of my Lectures, I had occasion to"
12617,SONNET III,"point out the almost faultless position and choice of words, in Pope’s"
12618,SONNET III,"original compositions, particularly in his Satires and moral Essays,"
12619,SONNET III,"for the purpose of comparing them with his translation of Homer, which,"
12620,SONNET III,"I do not stand alone in regarding, as the main source of our"
12621,SONNET III,"pseudo-poetic diction. And this, by the bye, is an additional"
12622,SONNET III,"confirmation of a remark made, I believe, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, that"
12623,SONNET III,"next to the man who forms and elevates the taste of the public, he that"
12624,SONNET III,"corrupts it, is commonly the greatest genius. Among other passages, I"
12625,SONNET III,"analyzed sentence by sentence, and almost word by word, the popular"
12626,SONNET III,"lines,"
12627,SONNET III,
12628,SONNET III,"As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night, etc."
12629,SONNET III,(Iliad. B. viii.)
12630,SONNET III,
12631,SONNET III,"much in the same way as has been since done, in an excellent article on"
12632,SONNET III,Chalmers’s British Poets in the Quarterly Review. The impression on the
12633,SONNET III,audience in general was sudden and evident: and a number of enlightened
12634,SONNET III,"and highly educated persons, who at different times afterwards addressed"
12635,SONNET III,"me on the subject, expressed their wonder, that truth so obvious should"
12636,SONNET III,not have struck them before; but at the same time acknowledged--(so much
12637,SONNET III,"had they been accustomed, in reading poetry, to receive pleasure from"
12638,SONNET III,"the separate images and phrases successively, without asking themselves"
12639,SONNET III,whether the collective meaning was sense or nonsense)--that they might
12640,SONNET III,in all probability have read the same passage again twenty times with
12641,SONNET III,"undiminished admiration, and without once reflecting, that"
12642,SONNET III,
12643,SONNET III,astra phaeinaen amphi selaenaen
12644,SONNET III,phainet aritretea--
12645,SONNET III,
12646,SONNET III,"(that is, the stars around, or near the full moon, shine pre-eminently"
12647,SONNET III,bright) conveys a just and happy image of a moonlight sky: while it is
12648,SONNET III,"difficult to determine whether, in the lines,"
12649,SONNET III,
12650,SONNET III,"Around her throne the vivid planets roll,"
12651,SONNET III,"And stars unnumber’d gild the glowing pole,"
12652,SONNET III,
12653,SONNET III,"the sense or the diction be the more absurd. My answer was; that, though"
12654,SONNET III,"I had derived peculiar advantages from my school discipline, and"
12655,SONNET III,"though my general theory of poetry was the same then as now, I had yet"
12656,SONNET III,"experienced the same sensations myself, and felt almost as if I had"
12657,SONNET III,"been newly couched, when, by Mr. Wordsworth’s conversation, I had been"
12658,SONNET III,induced to re-examine with impartial strictness Gray’s celebrated Elegy.
12659,SONNET III,I had long before detected the defects in The Bard; but the Elegy I had
12660,SONNET III,considered as proof against all fair attacks; and to this day I cannot
12661,SONNET III,"read either without delight, and a portion of enthusiasm. At all events,"
12662,SONNET III,whatever pleasure I may have lost by the clearer perception of the
12663,SONNET III,"faults in certain passages, has been more than repaid to me by the"
12664,SONNET III,additional delight with which I read the remainder.
12665,SONNET III,
12666,SONNET III,Another instance in confirmation of these remarks occurs to me in the
12667,SONNET III,Faithful Shepherdess. Seward first traces Fletcher’s lines;
12668,SONNET III,
12669,SONNET III,More foul diseases than e’er yet the hot
12670,SONNET III,"Sun bred thro’ his burnings, while the dog"
12671,SONNET III,"Pursues the raging lion, throwing the fog"
12672,SONNET III,"And deadly vapour from his angry breath,"
12673,SONNET III,"Filling the lower world with plague and death,"
12674,SONNET III,
12675,SONNET III,"to Spenser’s Shepherd’s Calendar,"
12676,SONNET III,
12677,SONNET III,The rampant lion hunts he fast
12678,SONNET III,With dogs of noisome breath;
12679,SONNET III,"Whose baleful barking brings, in haste,"
12680,SONNET III,"Pine, plagues, and dreary death!"
12681,SONNET III,
12682,SONNET III,He then takes occasion to introduce Homer’s simile of the appearance of
12683,SONNET III,Achilles’ mail to Priam compared with the Dog Star; literally thus--
12684,SONNET III,
12685,SONNET III,"“For this indeed is most splendid, but it was made an evil sign, and"
12686,SONNET III,brings many a consuming disease to wretched mortals.” Nothing can be
12687,SONNET III,"more simple as a description, or more accurate as a simile; which, (says"
12688,SONNET III,"Seward,) is thus finely translated by Mr. Pope"
12689,SONNET III,
12690,SONNET III,Terrific Glory! for his burning breath
12691,SONNET III,"Taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death!"
12692,SONNET III,
12693,SONNET III,"Now here--(not to mention the tremendous bombast)--the Dog Star, so"
12694,SONNET III,"called, is turned into a real dog, a very odd dog, a fire, fever,"
12695,SONNET III,"plague, and death-breathing, red, air-tainting dog: and the whole"
12696,SONNET III,"visual likeness is lost, while the likeness in the effects is rendered"
12697,SONNET III,absurd by the exaggeration. In Spenser and Fletcher the thought is
12698,SONNET III,"justifiable; for the images are at least consistent, and it was the"
12699,SONNET III,intention of the writers to mark the seasons by this allegory of
12700,SONNET III,visualized puns.]
12701,SONNET III,

13237,TRANSLATION:,[Footnote 40: Lord Grenville has lately re-asserted (in the House of

13239,TRANSLATION:,"war against France. I doubt not, that his Lordship is sincere; and it"

13241,TRANSLATION:,"evidences of the danger, to which a future historian can appeal? Or"
13242,TRANSLATION:,must he rest on an assertion? Let me be permitted to extract a passage
13243,TRANSLATION:,on the subject from The Friend. “I have said that to withstand the
13244,TRANSLATION:,"arguments of the lawless, the anti-Jacobins proposed to suspend the"
13245,TRANSLATION:,"law, and by the interposition of a particular statute to eclipse the"
13246,TRANSLATION:,"blessed light of the universal sun, that spies and informers might"
13247,TRANSLATION:,tyrannize and escape in the ominous darkness. Oh! if these mistaken
13248,TRANSLATION:,"men, intoxicated with alarm and bewildered by that panic of property,"
13249,TRANSLATION:,"which they themselves were the chief agents in exciting, had ever lived"
13250,TRANSLATION:,in a country where there really existed a general disposition to change
13251,TRANSLATION:,and rebellion! Had they ever travelled through Sicily; or through
13252,TRANSLATION:,France at the first coming on of the revolution; or even alas! through
13253,TRANSLATION:,too many of the provinces of a sister island; they could not but have
13254,TRANSLATION:,shrunk from their own declarations concerning the state of feeling and
13255,TRANSLATION:,opinion at that time predominant throughout Great Britain. There was a
13256,TRANSLATION:,time--(Heaven grant that that time may have passed by!)--when by
13257,TRANSLATION:,"crossing a narrow strait, they might have learned the true symptoms of"
13258,TRANSLATION:,"approaching danger, and have secured themselves from mistaking the"
13259,TRANSLATION:,"meetings and idle rant of such sedition, as shrank appalled from the"
13260,TRANSLATION:,"sight of a constable, for the dire murmuring and strange consternation"
13261,TRANSLATION:,which precedes the storm or earthquake of national discord. Not only in
13262,TRANSLATION:,"coffee-houses and public theatres, but even at the tables of the"
13263,TRANSLATION:,"wealthy, they would have heard the advocates of existing Government"
13264,TRANSLATION:,"defend their cause in the language and with the tone of men, who are"
13265,TRANSLATION:,"conscious that they are in a minority. But in England, when the alarm"
13266,TRANSLATION:,"was at its highest, there was not a city, no, not a town or village, in"
13267,TRANSLATION:,which a man suspected of holding democratic principles could move
13268,TRANSLATION:,abroad without receiving some unpleasant proof of the hatred in which
13269,TRANSLATION:,his supposed opinions were held by the great majority of the people;
13270,TRANSLATION:,and the only instances of popular excess and indignation were on the
13271,TRANSLATION:,side of the government and the established church. But why need I
13272,TRANSLATION:,appeal to these invidious facts? Turn over the pages of history and
13273,TRANSLATION:,seek for a single instance of a revolution having been effected without
13274,TRANSLATION:,"the concurrence of either the nobles, or the ecclesiastics, or the"
13275,TRANSLATION:,"monied classes, in any country, in which the influences of property had"
13276,TRANSLATION:,"ever been predominant, and where the interests of the proprietors were"
13277,TRANSLATION:,interlinked! Examine the revolution of the Belgic provinces under
13278,TRANSLATION:,Philip II; the civil wars of France in the preceding generation; the
13279,TRANSLATION:,"history of the American revolution, or the yet more recent events in"
13280,TRANSLATION:,Sweden and in Spain; and it will be scarcely possible not to perceive
13281,TRANSLATION:,that in England from 1791 to the peace of Amiens there were neither
13282,TRANSLATION:,"tendencies to confederacy nor actual confederacies, against which the"
13283,TRANSLATION:,existing laws had not provided both sufficient safeguards and an ample
13284,TRANSLATION:,punishment. But alas! the panic of property had been struck in the
13285,TRANSLATION:,"first instance for party purposes; and when it became general, its"
13286,TRANSLATION:,propagators caught it themselves and ended in believing their own lie;
13287,TRANSLATION:,even as our bulls to Borrowdale sometimes run mad with the echo of
13288,TRANSLATION:,their own bellowing. The consequences were most injurious. Our
13289,TRANSLATION:,"attention was concentrated on a monster, which could not survive the"
13290,TRANSLATION:,"convulsions, in which it had been brought forth,--even the enlightened"
13291,TRANSLATION:,"Burke himself too often talking and reasoning, as if a perpetual and"
13292,TRANSLATION:,organized anarchy had been a possible thing! Thus while we were warring
13293,TRANSLATION:,"against French doctrines, we took little heed whether the means by"
13294,TRANSLATION:,"which we attempted to overthrow them, were not likely to aid and"
13295,TRANSLATION:,augment the far more formidable evil of French ambition. Like children
13296,TRANSLATION:,"we ran away from the yelping of a cur, and took shelter at the heels of"

13475,TRANSLATION:,ordinated as the arguments seem to require. For Cogito is Sum Cogitans.
13476,TRANSLATION:,"This is clear by the inevidence of the converse. Cogitat, ergo est is"
13477,TRANSLATION:,"true, because it is a mere application of the logical rule: Quicquid in"

13501,TRANSLATION:,"reader, that those, who adopt so perverted a mode of reasoning, are"
13502,TRANSLATION:,under a grievous error. Whatever opposes the formal principles of the

13511,TRANSLATION:,"itself merely subjective (i.e. an incapacity in the nature of man), too"
13512,TRANSLATION:,often passes for an incongruity or impossibility in the object (i.e.

13563,TRANSLATION:,"their author mentioned in any English work, or to have found them in"
13564,TRANSLATION:,any of the common collections of Italian poetry; and as the little work
13565,TRANSLATION:,is of rare occurrence; I will transcribe a few specimens. I have seldom
13566,TRANSLATION:,"met with compositions that possessed, to my feelings, more of that"
13567,TRANSLATION:,"satisfying entireness, that complete adequateness of the manner to the"
13568,TRANSLATION:,"matter which so charms us in Anacreon, joined with the tenderness, and"
13569,TRANSLATION:,"more than the delicacy of Catullus. Trifles as they are, they were"
13570,TRANSLATION:,probably elaborated with great care; yet to the perusal we refer them
13571,TRANSLATION:,to a spontaneous energy rather than to voluntary effort. To a
13572,TRANSLATION:,"cultivated taste there is a delight in perfection for its own sake,"
13573,TRANSLATION:,"independently of the material in which it is manifested, that none but"
13574,TRANSLATION:,a cultivated taste can understand or appreciate.
13575,TRANSLATION:,
13576,TRANSLATION:,"After what I have advanced, it would appear presumption to offer a"
13577,TRANSLATION:,translation; even if the attempt were not discouraged by the different
13578,TRANSLATION:,"genius of the English mind and language, which demands a denser body of"
13579,TRANSLATION:,"thought as the condition of a high polish, than the Italian. I cannot"
13580,TRANSLATION:,"but deem it likewise an advantage in the Italian tongue, in many other"
13581,TRANSLATION:,"respects inferior to our own, that the language of poetry is more"
13582,TRANSLATION:,distinct from that of prose than with us. From the earlier appearance
13583,TRANSLATION:,"and established primacy of the Tuscan poets, concurring with the number"
13584,TRANSLATION:,"of independent states, and the diversity of written dialects, the"
13585,TRANSLATION:,"Italians have gained a poetic idiom, as the Greeks before them had"
13586,TRANSLATION:,obtained from the same causes with greater and more various
13587,TRANSLATION:,"discriminations, for example, the Ionic for their heroic verses; the"
13588,TRANSLATION:,Attic for their iambic; and the two modes of the Doric for the lyric or
13589,TRANSLATION:,"sacerdotal, and the pastoral, the distinctions of which were doubtless"
13590,TRANSLATION:,more obvious to the Greeks themselves than they are to us.
13591,TRANSLATION:,
13592,TRANSLATION:,I will venture to add one other observation before I proceed to the
13593,TRANSLATION:,transcription. I am aware that the sentiments which I have avowed
13594,TRANSLATION:,concerning the points of difference between the poetry of the present
13595,TRANSLATION:,"age, and that of the period between 1500 and 1650, are the reverse of"
13596,TRANSLATION:,the opinion commonly entertained. I was conversing on this subject with
13597,TRANSLATION:,"a friend, when the servant, a worthy and sensible woman, coming in, I"
13598,TRANSLATION:,"placed before her two engravings, the one a pinky-coloured plate of the"
13599,TRANSLATION:,"day, the other a masterly etching by Salvator Rosa from one of his own"
13600,TRANSLATION:,"pictures. On pressing her to tell us, which she preferred, after a"
13601,TRANSLATION:,"little blushing and flutter of feeling, she replied “Why, that, Sir, to"
13602,TRANSLATION:,be sure! (pointing to the ware from the Fleet-street print
13603,TRANSLATION:,shops);--it’s so neat and elegant. T’other is such a scratchy slovenly
13604,TRANSLATION:,"thing.” An artist, whose writings are scarcely less valuable than his"
13605,TRANSLATION:,"pictures, and to whose authority more deference will be willingly paid,"
13606,TRANSLATION:,"than I could even wish should be shown to mine, has told us, and from"
13607,TRANSLATION:,"his own experience too, that good taste must be acquired, and like all"
13608,TRANSLATION:,"other good things, is the result of thought and the submissive study of"
13609,TRANSLATION:,"the best models. If it be asked, “But what shall I deem such?”--the"
13610,TRANSLATION:,"answer is; presume those to be the best, the reputation of which has"
13611,TRANSLATION:,been matured into fame by the consent of ages. For wisdom always has a
13612,TRANSLATION:,"final majority, if not by conviction, yet by acquiescence. In addition"
13613,TRANSLATION:,to Sir J. Reynolds I may mention Harris of Salisbury; who in one of his
13614,TRANSLATION:,philosophical disquisitions has written on the means of acquiring a
13615,TRANSLATION:,"just taste with the precision of Aristotle, and the elegance of"

13785,MADRIGALI.,"a difference, the child is made to repeat the words with his eyes from"
13786,MADRIGALI.,"off the book; and then, indeed, his tones resemble talking, as far as"
13787,MADRIGALI.,"his fears, tears and trembling will permit. But as soon as the eye is"
13788,MADRIGALI.,"again directed to the printed page, the spell begins anew; for an"

13843,REMORSE.,"already quoted from THE SAILOR’S MOTHER, I can recollect but one"
13844,REMORSE.,"instance: that is to say, a short passage of four or five lines in THE"
13845,REMORSE.,"BROTHERS, that model of English pastoral, which I never yet read with"
13846,REMORSE.,"unclouded eye.--“James, pointing to its summit, over which they had all"
13847,REMORSE.,"purposed to return together, informed them that he would wait for them"
13848,REMORSE.,"there. They parted, and his comrades passed that way some two hours"
13849,REMORSE.,"after, but they did not find him at the appointed place, _a"
13850,REMORSE.,"circumstance of which they took no heed:_ but one of them, going by"
13851,REMORSE.,"chance into the house, which at this time was James’s house, learnt"
13852,REMORSE.,"_there,_ that nobody had seen him all that day.” The only change which"
13853,REMORSE.,has been made is in the position of the little word there in two
13854,REMORSE.,"instances, the position in the original being clearly such as is not"
13855,REMORSE.,adopted in ordinary conversation. The other words printed in italics
13856,REMORSE.,"were so marked because, though good and genuine English, they are not"
13857,REMORSE.,the phraseology of common conversation either in the word put in
13858,REMORSE.,"apposition, or in the connection by the genitive pronoun. Men in"
13859,REMORSE.,"general would have said, “but that was a circumstance they paid no"
13860,REMORSE.,"attention to, or took no notice of;” and the language is, on the theory"
13861,REMORSE.,"of the preface, justified only by the narrator’s being the Vicar. Yet"
13862,REMORSE.,"if any ear could suspect, that these sentences were ever printed as"

13885,REMORSE.,have made in the works of a poet less austerely accurate in the use of
13886,REMORSE.,"words, than he is, to his own great honour. It respects the propriety"
13887,REMORSE.,"of the word, “scene,” even in the sentence in which it is retained."
13888,REMORSE.,"Dryden, and he only in his more careless verses, was the first, as far"
13889,REMORSE.,"as my researches have discovered, who for the convenience of rhyme used"
13890,REMORSE.,"this word in the vague sense, which has been since too current even in"
13891,REMORSE.,"our best writers, and which (unfortunately, I think) is given as its"
13892,REMORSE.,first explanation in Dr. Johnson’s Dictionary and therefore would be
13893,REMORSE.,taken by an incautious reader as its proper sense. In Shakespeare and
13894,REMORSE.,"Milton the word is never used without some clear reference, proper or"
13895,REMORSE.,"metaphorical, to the theatre. Thus Milton:"
13896,REMORSE.,
13897,REMORSE.,"“Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm"
13898,REMORSE.,"A sylvan scene; and, as the ranks ascend"

13900,REMORSE.,Of stateliest view.”
13901,REMORSE.,
13902,REMORSE.,"I object to any extension of its meaning, because the word is already"
13903,REMORSE.,"more equivocal than might be wished; inasmuch as to the limited use,"
13904,REMORSE.,"which I recommend, it may still signify two different things; namely,"
13905,REMORSE.,"the scenery, and the characters and actions presented on the stage"
13906,REMORSE.,during the presence of particular scenes. It can therefore be preserved

13939,REMORSE.,
13940,REMORSE.,[Footnote 78: Klopstock’s observation was partly true and partly
13941,REMORSE.,"erroneous. In the literal sense of his words, and, if we confine the"
13942,REMORSE.,comparison to the average of space required for the expression of the
13943,REMORSE.,"same thought in the two languages, it is erroneous. I have translated"
13944,REMORSE.,"some German hexameters into English hexameter; and find, that on the"
13945,REMORSE.,average three English lines will express four lines German. The reason
13946,REMORSE.,is evident: our language abounds in monosyllables and dissyllables. The
13947,REMORSE.,"German, not less than the Greek, is a polysyllable language. But in"
13948,REMORSE.,another point of view the remark was not without foundation. For the
13949,REMORSE.,"German possessing the same unlimited privilege of forming compounds,"
13950,REMORSE.,"both with prepositions and with epithets, as the Greek, it can express"
13951,REMORSE.,"the richest single Greek word in a single German one, and is thus freed"
13952,REMORSE.,from the necessity of weak or ungraceful paraphrases. I will content
13953,REMORSE.,"myself with one at present, viz. the use of the prefixed participles"
13954,REMORSE.,"ver, zer, ent, and weg: thus reissen to rend, verreissen to rend away,"
13955,REMORSE.,"zerreissen to rend to pieces, entreissen to rend off or out of a thing,"
13956,REMORSE.,"in the active sense: or schmelzen to melt--ver, zer, ent,"
13957,REMORSE.,schmelzen--and in like manner through all the verbs neuter and active.
13958,REMORSE.,"If you consider only how much we should feel the loss of the prefix be,"
13959,REMORSE.,"as in bedropt, besprinkle, besot, especially in our poetical language,"
13960,REMORSE.,and then think that this same mode of composition is carved through all
13961,REMORSE.,"their simple and compound prepositions, and many of their adverbs; and"
13962,REMORSE.,that with most of these the Germans have the same privilege as we have
13963,REMORSE.,of dividing them from the verb and placing them at the end of the
13964,REMORSE.,sentence; you will have no difficulty in comprehending the reality and
13965,REMORSE.,"the cause of this superior power in the German of condensing meaning,"
13966,REMORSE.,in which its great poet exulted. It is impossible to read half a dozen
13967,REMORSE.,pages of Wieland without perceiving that in this respect the German has
13968,REMORSE.,"no rival but the Greek. And yet I feel, that concentration or"
13969,REMORSE.,"condensation is not the happiest mode of expressing this excellence,"
13970,REMORSE.,which seems to consist not so much in the less time required for
13971,REMORSE.,"conveying an impression, as in the unity and simultaneousness with"
13972,REMORSE.,which the impression is conveyed. It tends to make their language more
13973,REMORSE.,picturesque: it depictures images better. We have obtained this power
13974,REMORSE.,in part by our compound verbs derived from the Latin: and the sense of
13975,REMORSE.,its great effect no doubt induced our Milton both to the use and the
13976,REMORSE.,"abuse of Latin derivatives. But still these prefixed particles,"
13977,REMORSE.,"conveying no separate or separable meaning to the mere English reader,"
13978,REMORSE.,cannot possibly act on the mind with the force or liveliness of an
13979,REMORSE.,"original and homogeneous language such as the German is, and besides"
