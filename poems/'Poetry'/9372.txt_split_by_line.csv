114,THE VEERY,THE VEERY
115,THE VEERY,
116,THE VEERY,"The moonbeams over Arno's vale in silver flood were pouring,"
117,THE VEERY,When first I heard the nightingale a long-lost love deploring.
118,THE VEERY,"So passionate, so full of pain, it sounded strange and eerie;"
119,THE VEERY,"I longed to hear a simpler strain,--the woodnotes of the veery."
120,THE VEERY,
121,THE VEERY,The laverock sings a bonny lay above the Scottish heather;
122,THE VEERY,It sprinkles down from far away like light and love together;
123,THE VEERY,"He drops the golden notes to greet his brooding mate, his dearie;"
124,THE VEERY,"I only know one song more sweet,--the vespers of the veery."
125,THE VEERY,
126,THE VEERY,"In English gardens, green and bright and full of fruity treasure,"
127,THE VEERY,I heard the blackbird with delight repeat his merry measure:
128,THE VEERY,"The ballad was a pleasant one, the tune was loud and cheery,"
129,THE VEERY,"And yet, with every setting sun, I listened for the veery."
130,THE VEERY,
131,THE VEERY,"But far away, and far away, the tawny thrush is singing;"
132,THE VEERY,"New England woods, at close of day, with that clear chant are ringing:"
133,THE VEERY,"And when my light of life is low, and heart and flesh are weary,"
134,THE VEERY,"I fain would hear, before I go, the wood-notes of the veery."
135,THE VEERY,

141,THE SONG-SPARROW,THE SONG-SPARROW
142,THE SONG-SPARROW,
143,THE SONG-SPARROW,"There is a bird I know so well,"
144,THE SONG-SPARROW,It seems as if he must have sung
145,THE SONG-SPARROW,Beside my crib when I was young;
146,THE SONG-SPARROW,Before I knew the way to spell
147,THE SONG-SPARROW,"The name of even the smallest bird,"
148,THE SONG-SPARROW,His gentle-joyful song I heard.
149,THE SONG-SPARROW,"Now see if you can tell, my dear,"
150,THE SONG-SPARROW,"What bird it is that, every year,"
151,THE SONG-SPARROW,"Sings _""Sweet--sweet--sweet--very merry cheer.""_"
152,THE SONG-SPARROW,
153,THE SONG-SPARROW,"He comes in March, when winds are strong,"
154,THE SONG-SPARROW,And snow returns to hide the earth;
155,THE SONG-SPARROW,"But still he warms his heart with mirth,"
156,THE SONG-SPARROW,And waits for May. He lingers long
157,THE SONG-SPARROW,While flowers fade; and every day
158,THE SONG-SPARROW,"Repeats his small, contented lay;"
159,THE SONG-SPARROW,"As if to say, we need not fear"
160,THE SONG-SPARROW,"The season's change, if love is here"
161,THE SONG-SPARROW,"With _""Sweet--sweet--sweet--very merry cheer.""_"
162,THE SONG-SPARROW,
163,THE SONG-SPARROW,He does not wear a Joseph's-coat
164,THE SONG-SPARROW,"Of many colours, smart and gay;"
165,THE SONG-SPARROW,"His suit is Quaker brown and gray,"
166,THE SONG-SPARROW,With darker patches at his throat.
167,THE SONG-SPARROW,And yet of all the well-dressed throng
168,THE SONG-SPARROW,Not one can sing so brave a song.
169,THE SONG-SPARROW,It makes the pride of looks appear
170,THE SONG-SPARROW,"A vain and foolish thing, to hear"
171,THE SONG-SPARROW,"His _""Sweet--sweet--sweet--very merry cheer.""_"
172,THE SONG-SPARROW,
173,THE SONG-SPARROW,"A lofty place he does not love,"
174,THE SONG-SPARROW,"But sits by choice, and well at ease,"
175,THE SONG-SPARROW,"In hedges, and in little trees"
176,THE SONG-SPARROW,That stretch their slender arms above
177,THE SONG-SPARROW,The meadow-brook; and there he sings
178,THE SONG-SPARROW,Till all the field with pleasure rings;
179,THE SONG-SPARROW,"And so he tells in every ear,"
180,THE SONG-SPARROW,That lowly homes to heaven are near
181,THE SONG-SPARROW,"In _""Sweet--sweet--sweet--very merry cheer.""_"
182,THE SONG-SPARROW,
183,THE SONG-SPARROW,"I like the tune, I like the words;"
184,THE SONG-SPARROW,"They seem so true, so free from art,"
185,THE SONG-SPARROW,"So friendly, and so full of heart,"
186,THE SONG-SPARROW,That if but one of all the birds
187,THE SONG-SPARROW,"Could be my comrade everywhere,"
188,THE SONG-SPARROW,"My little brother of the air,"
189,THE SONG-SPARROW,"I'd choose the song-sparrow, my dear,"
190,THE SONG-SPARROW,"Because he'd bless me, every year,"
191,THE SONG-SPARROW,"With _""Sweet--sweet--sweet--very merry cheer.""_"

199,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,
200,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,When May bedecks the naked trees
201,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"With tassels and embroideries,"
202,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,And many blue-eyed violets beam
203,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"Along the edges of the stream,"
204,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"I hear a voice that seems to say,"
205,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"Now near at hand, now far away,"
206,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"_""Witchery--witchery--witchery.""_"
207,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,
208,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"An incantation so serene,"
209,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"So innocent, befits the scene:"
210,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,There's magic in that small bird's note--
211,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"See, there he flits--the Yellow-throat;"
212,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"A living sunbeam, tipped with wings,"
213,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,A spark of light that shines and sings
214,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"_""Witchery--witchery--witchery.""_"
215,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,
216,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"You prophet with a pleasant name,"
217,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"If out of Mary-land you came,"
218,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,You know the way that thither goes
219,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,Where Mary's lovely garden grows:
220,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"Fly swiftly back to her, I pray,"
221,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"And try to call her down this way,"
222,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"_""Witchery--witchery--witchery.""_"
223,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,
224,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"Tell her to leave her cockle-shells,"
225,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,And all her little silver bells
226,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"That blossom into melody,"
227,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,And all her maids less fair than she.
228,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"She does not need these pretty things,"
229,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"For everywhere she comes, she brings"
230,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"_""Witchery--witchery--witchery.""_"
231,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,
232,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"The woods are greening overhead,"
233,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,And flowers adorn each mossy bed;
234,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,The waters babble as they run--
235,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"One thing is lacking, only one:"
236,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"If Mary were but here to-day,"
237,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"I would believe your charming lay,"
238,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"_""Witchery--witchery--witchery.""_"
239,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,
240,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,Along the shady road I look--
241,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,Who's coming now across the brook?
242,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"A woodland maid, all robed in white--"
243,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"The leaves dance round her with delight,"
244,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,The stream laughs out beneath her feet--
245,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"Sing, merry bird, the charm's complete,"
246,THE MARYLAND YELLOW-THROAT,"""_Witchery--witchery--witchery!_"""

255,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"Do you remember, father,--"
256,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"It seems so long ago,--"
257,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,The day we fished together
258,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,Along the Pocono?
259,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"At dusk I waited for you,"
260,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"Beside the lumber-mill,"
261,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,And there I heard a hidden bird
262,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"That chanted, ""whip-poor-will,"""
263,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"""_Whippoorwill! whippoorwill!_"""
264,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"Sad and shrill,--""_whippoorwill!_"""
265,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,
266,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,The place was all deserted;
267,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,The mill-wheel hung at rest;
268,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,The lonely star of evening
269,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,Was throbbing in the west;
270,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,The veil of night was falling;
271,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,The winds were folded still;
272,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,And everywhere the trembling air
273,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"Re-echoed ""whip-poor-will!"""
274,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"""_Whippoorwill! whippoorwill!_"""
275,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"Sad and shrill,--""_whippoorwill!_"""
276,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,
277,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"You seemed so long in coming,"
278,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,I felt so much alone;
279,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"The wide, dark world was round me,"
280,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,And life was all unknown;
281,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"The hand of sorrow touched me,"
282,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,And made my senses thrill
283,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,With all the pain that haunts the strain
284,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,Of mournful whip-poor-will.
285,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"""_Whippoorwill! whippoorwill!_"""
286,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"Sad and shrill,--""_whippoorwill!_"""
287,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,
288,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,What knew I then of trouble?
289,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"An idle little lad,"
290,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,I had not learned the lessons
291,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,That make men wise and sad.
292,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"I dreamed of grief and parting,"
293,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,And something seemed to fill
294,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"My heart with tears, while in my ears"
295,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"Resounded ""whip-poor-will."""
296,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"""_Whippoorwill!  whippoorwill!_"""
297,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"Sad and shrill,--""_whippoorwill!_"""
298,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,
299,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"'Twas but a cloud of sadness,"
300,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,That lightly passed away;
301,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,But I have learned the meaning
302,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"Of sorrow, since that day."
303,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"For nevermore at twilight,"
304,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"Beside the silent mill,"
305,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"I'll wait for you, in the falling dew,"
306,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,And hear the whip-poor-will.
307,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"""_Whippoorwill!  whippoorwill!_"""
308,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"Sad and shrill,--""_whippoorwill!_"""
309,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,
310,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,But if you still remember
311,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"In that fair land of light,"
312,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,The pains and fears that touch us
313,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"Along this edge of night,"
314,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"I think all earthly grieving,"
315,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"And all our mortal ill,"
316,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,To you must seem like a sad boy's dream
317,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,Who hears the whip-poor-will.
318,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"""_Whippoorwill! whippoorwill!_"""
319,THE WHIP-POOR-WILL,"A passing thrill,--""_whippoorwill!_"""

418,SEA-GULLS OF MANHATTAN,
419,SEA-GULLS OF MANHATTAN,Even so the wild-woods of Manhattan

683,THE LILY OF YORROW,Faintly it falls through the shadowy glades when the south wind is blowing.
684,THE LILY OF YORROW,

700,THE LILY OF YORROW,
701,THE LILY OF YORROW,Surely to see it is peace and the crown of a lifelong endeavour;
702,THE LILY OF YORROW,"Surely to pluck it is gladness,--but they who have found it can never"

856,THE PARTING AND THE COMING GUEST,"But look, her violet eyes are wet"
857,THE PARTING AND THE COMING GUEST,"With bright, unfallen, dewy tears;"
858,THE PARTING AND THE COMING GUEST,And in her song my fancy hears
859,THE PARTING AND THE COMING GUEST,A note of sorrow trembling yet.
860,THE PARTING AND THE COMING GUEST,"Perhaps, beyond the town, she met"
861,THE PARTING AND THE COMING GUEST,Old Winter as he limped away
862,THE PARTING AND THE COMING GUEST,"To die forlorn, and let him lay"
863,THE PARTING AND THE COMING GUEST,"His weary head upon her knee,"
864,THE PARTING AND THE COMING GUEST,And kissed his forehead with regret
865,THE PARTING AND THE COMING GUEST,"For one so gray and lonely,--see,"
866,THE PARTING AND THE COMING GUEST,Her eyes with tender tears are wet.
867,THE PARTING AND THE COMING GUEST,

881,I,"When tulips bloom in Union Square,"

893,I,I'm only wishing to go a-fishing;
894,I,For this the month of May was made.

897,II,II
898,II,
899,II,I guess the pussy-willows now
900,II,Are creeping out on every bough
901,II,Along the brook; and robins look
902,II,For early worms behind the plough.
903,II,
904,II,"The thistle-birds have changed their dun,"

906,II,And in the same array of flame
907,II,The Dandelion Show's begun.
908,II,
909,II,The flocks of young anemones
910,II,Are dancing round the budding trees:
911,II,Who can help wishing to go a-fishing
912,II,In days as full of joy as these?
913,II,

917,III,I think the meadow-lark's clear sound
918,III,"Leaks upward slowly from the ground,"
919,III,While on the wing the bluebirds ring
920,III,Their wedding-bells to woods around.
921,III,
922,III,The flirting chewink calls his dear
923,III,"Behind the bush; and very near,"
924,III,"Where water flows, where green grass grows,"
925,III,"Song-sparrows gently sing, ""Good cheer."""
926,III,
927,III,"And, best of all, through twilight's calm"
928,III,The hermit-thrush repeats his psalm.
929,III,How much I'm wishing to go a-fishing
930,III,In days so sweet with music's balm!

935,IV,'Tis not a proud desire of mine;

937,IV,"No heavy weight, no salmon great,"

939,IV,
940,IV,"Only an idle little stream,"
941,IV,"Whose amber waters softly gleam,"
942,IV,"Where I may wade through woodland shade,"
943,IV,"And cast the fly, and loaf, and dream:"
944,IV,

960,I,"Ah, who will tell me, in these leaden days,"
961,I,"Why the sweet Spring delays,"
962,I,"And where she hides,--the dear desire"
963,I,Of every heart that longs
964,I,"For bloom, and fragrance, and the ruby fire"
965,I,"Of maple-buds along the misty hills,"
966,I,And that immortal call which fills
967,I,The waiting wood with songs?
968,I,"The snow-drops came so long ago,"
969,I,It seemed that Spring was near!
970,I,But then returned the snow
971,I,"With biting winds, and earth grew sere,"
972,I,And sullen clouds drooped low
973,I,To veil the sadness of a hope deferred:
974,I,"Then rain, rain, rain, incessant rain"
975,I,"Beat on the window-pane,"
976,I,
977,I,Through which I watched the solitary bird
978,I,"That braved the tempest, buffeted and tossed"
979,I,With rumpled feathers down the wind again.
980,I,"Oh, were the seeds all lost"
981,I,When winter laid the wild flowers in their tomb?
982,I,I searched the woods in vain
983,I,"For blue hepaticas, and trilliums white,"
984,I,"And trailing arbutus, the Spring's delight,"
985,I,Starring the withered leaves with rosy bloom.
986,I,But every night the frost
987,I,"To all my longing spoke a silent nay,"
988,I,And told me Spring was far away.
989,I,"Even the robins were too cold to sing,"
990,I,"Except a broken and discouraged note,--"
991,I,"Only the tuneful sparrow, on whose throat"
992,I,"Music has put her triple finger-print,"
993,I,"Lifted his head and sang my heart a hint,--"

999,II,"But now, Carina, what divine amends"
1000,II,"For all delay! What sweetness treasured up,"
1001,II,What wine of joy that blends
1002,II,"A hundred flavours in a single cup,"
1003,II,Is poured into this perfect day!
1004,II,"For look, sweet heart, here are the early flowers"
1005,II,"That lingered on their way,"
1006,II,"Thronging in haste to kiss the feet of May,"
1007,II,"Entangled with the bloom of later hours,--"
1008,II,"Anemones and cinque-foils, violets blue"
1009,II,"And white, and iris richly gleaming through"
1010,II,"The grasses of the meadow, and a blaze"
1011,II,"Of butter-cups and daisies in the field,"
1012,II,"Filling the air with praise,"
1013,II,As if a chime of golden bells had pealed!
1014,II,The frozen songs within the breast
1015,II,"Of silent birds that hid in leafless woods,"
1016,II,Melt into rippling floods
1017,II,Of gladness unrepressed.
1018,II,"Now oriole and bluebird, thrush and lark,"
1019,II,"Warbler and wren and vireo,"
1020,II,Mingle their melody; the living spark
1021,II,"Of love has touched the fuel of desire,"
1022,II,And every heart leaps up in singing fire.
1023,II,
1024,II,It seems as if the land
1025,II,"Were breathing deep beneath the sun's caress,"
1026,II,"Trembling with tenderness,"
1027,II,"While all the woods expand,"
1028,II,"In shimmering clouds of rose and gold and green,"
1029,II,To veil a joy too sacred to be seen.
1030,II,
1031,II,
1032,III,III
1033,III,
1034,III,"Come, put your hand in mine,"

1036,III,And lead me deep into the Spring divine
1037,III,That makes amends for all the wintry past.
1038,III,For all the flowers and songs I feared to miss
1039,III,Arrive with you;
1040,III,And in the lingering pressure of your kiss
1041,III,My dreams come true;
1042,III,And in the promise of your generous eyes
1043,III,I read the mystic sign
1044,III,Of joy more perfect made
1045,III,"Because so long delayed,"
1046,III,And bliss enhanced by rapture of surprise.
1047,III,
1048,III,"Ah, think not early love alone is strong;"
1049,III,He loveth best whose heart has learned to wait:
1050,III,"Dear messenger of Spring that tarried long,"
1051,III,You're doubly dear because you come so late.

1784,SALUTE TO THE TREES,"Some for the strength of the gnarled root,"
1785,SALUTE TO THE TREES,Some for the sweetness of flower or fruit;
1786,SALUTE TO THE TREES,"Some for shelter against the storm,"

1790,SALUTE TO THE TREES,In the wealth of the wood since the world began
1791,SALUTE TO THE TREES,The trees have offered their gifts to man.
1792,SALUTE TO THE TREES,
1793,SALUTE TO THE TREES,But the glory of trees is more than their gifts:

1799,SALUTE TO THE TREES,Their roots are the nurses of rivers in birth;

1834,DAYBREAK,"Of ancient secrets,--gray and ghostly gulf"
1835,DAYBREAK,"Cleft in the green of this high forest land,"
1836,DAYBREAK,And crowded in the dark with giant forms!
1837,DAYBREAK,"Art thou a grave, a prison, or a shrine?"
1838,DAYBREAK,
1839,DAYBREAK,A stillness deeper than the dearth of sound
1840,DAYBREAK,Broods over thee: a living silence breathes
1841,DAYBREAK,Perpetual incense from thy dim abyss.
1842,DAYBREAK,The morning-stars that sang above the bower
1843,DAYBREAK,"Of Eden, passing over thee, are dumb"
1844,DAYBREAK,With trembling bright amazement; and the

1848,DAYBREAK,"Her hand upon her lips, to look on thee!"
1849,DAYBREAK,
1850,DAYBREAK,She peers into thy depths with silent prayer

1852,DAYBREAK,"O Earth, swift-rolling Earth, reveal, reveal,--"
1853,DAYBREAK,"Turn to the East, and show upon thy breast"

1856,DAYBREAK,The resurrection of the world of hues
1857,DAYBREAK,"That die with dark, and daily rise again"
1858,DAYBREAK,With every rising of the splendid Sun!
1859,DAYBREAK,
1860,DAYBREAK,"Be still, my heart! Now Nature holds her breath"
1861,DAYBREAK,To see the solar flood of radiance leap
1862,DAYBREAK,"Across the chasm, and crown the western rim"
1863,DAYBREAK,Of alabaster with a far-away
1864,DAYBREAK,"Rampart of pearl, and flowing down by walls"
1865,DAYBREAK,"Of changeful opal, deepen into gold"
1866,DAYBREAK,"Of topaz, rosy gold of tourmaline,"
1867,DAYBREAK,"Crimson of garnet, green and gray of jade,"
1868,DAYBREAK,"Purple of amethyst, and ruby red,"
1869,DAYBREAK,"Beryl, and sard, and royal porphyry;"
1870,DAYBREAK,Until the cataract of colour breaks
1871,DAYBREAK,Upon the blackness of the granite floor.
1872,DAYBREAK,
1873,DAYBREAK,How far below! And all between is cleft
1874,DAYBREAK,And carved into a hundred curving miles
1875,DAYBREAK,"Of unimagined architecture! Tombs,"
1876,DAYBREAK,"Temples, and colonnades are neighboured there"
1877,DAYBREAK,"By fortresses that Titans might defend,"
1878,DAYBREAK,And amphitheatres where Gods might strive.
1879,DAYBREAK,"Cathedrals, buttressed with unnumbered tiers"
1880,DAYBREAK,"Of ruddy rock, lift to the sapphire sky"
1881,DAYBREAK,A single spire of marble pure as snow;
1882,DAYBREAK,And huge aerial palaces arise
1883,DAYBREAK,Like mountains built of unconsuming flame.
1884,DAYBREAK,"Along the weathered walls, or standing deep"
1885,DAYBREAK,"In riven valleys where no foot may tread,"
1886,DAYBREAK,"Are lonely pillars, and tall monuments"
1887,DAYBREAK,Of perished aeons and forgotten things.
1888,DAYBREAK,My sight is baffled by the wide array
1889,DAYBREAK,Of countless forms: my vision reels and swims
1890,DAYBREAK,"Above them, like a bird in whirling winds."
1891,DAYBREAK,Yet no confusion fills the awful chasm;
1892,DAYBREAK,But spacious order and a sense of peace
1893,DAYBREAK,Brood over all. For every shape that looms
1894,DAYBREAK,"Majestic in the throng, is set apart"
1895,DAYBREAK,"From all the others by its far-flung shade,"
1896,DAYBREAK,"Blue, blue, as if a mountain-lake were there."
1897,DAYBREAK,
1898,DAYBREAK,"How still it is!  Dear God, I hardly dare"
1899,DAYBREAK,"To breathe, for fear the fathomless abyss"
1900,DAYBREAK,Will draw me down into eternal sleep.
1901,DAYBREAK,
1902,DAYBREAK,What force has formed this masterpiece of awe?
1903,DAYBREAK,What hands have wrought these wonders in the waste?
1904,DAYBREAK,"O river, gleaming in the narrow rift"
1905,DAYBREAK,"Of gloom that cleaves the valley's nether deep,--"
1906,DAYBREAK,"Fierce Colorado, prisoned by thy toil,"
1907,DAYBREAK,"And blindly toiling still to reach the sea,--"
1908,DAYBREAK,"Thy waters, gathered from the snows and springs"
1909,DAYBREAK,"Amid the Utah hills, have carved this road"
1910,DAYBREAK,Of glory to the California Gulf.
1911,DAYBREAK,"But now, O sunken stream, thy splendour lost,"
1912,DAYBREAK,"'Twixt iron walls thou rollest turbid waves,"
1913,DAYBREAK,Too far away to make their fury heard!
1914,DAYBREAK,
1915,DAYBREAK,"At sight of thee, thou sullen labouring slave"
1916,DAYBREAK,"Of gravitation,--yellow torrent poured"
1917,DAYBREAK,"From distant mountains by no will of thine,"
1918,DAYBREAK,Through thrice a hundred centuries of slow
1919,DAYBREAK,"Fallings and liftings of the crust of Earth,--"
1920,DAYBREAK,At sight of thee my spirit sinks and fails.
1921,DAYBREAK,Art thou alone the Maker? Is the blind
1922,DAYBREAK,Unconscious power that drew thee dumbly down
1923,DAYBREAK,"To cut this gash across the layered globe,"
1924,DAYBREAK,The sole creative cause of all I see?
1925,DAYBREAK,Are force and matter all? The rest a dream?
1926,DAYBREAK,
1927,DAYBREAK,"Then is thy gorge a canyon of despair,"
1928,DAYBREAK,"A prison for the soul of man, a grave"
1929,DAYBREAK,Of all his dearest daring hopes! The world
1930,DAYBREAK,"Wherein we live and move is meaningless,"
1931,DAYBREAK,No spirit here to answer to our own!
1932,DAYBREAK,The stars without a guide: The chance-born
1933,DAYBREAK,Earth
1934,DAYBREAK,"Adrift in space, no Captain on the ship:"
1935,DAYBREAK,Nothing in all the universe to prove
1936,DAYBREAK,Eternal wisdom and eternal love!
1937,DAYBREAK,"And man, the latest accident of Time,--"
1938,DAYBREAK,"Who thinks he loves, and longs to understand,"
1939,DAYBREAK,"Who vainly suffers, and in vain is brave,"
1940,DAYBREAK,"Who dupes his heart with immortality,--"
1941,DAYBREAK,"Man is a living lie,--a bitter jest"
1942,DAYBREAK,"Upon himself,--a conscious grain of sand"
1943,DAYBREAK,"Lost in a desert of unconsciousness,"
1944,DAYBREAK,Thirsting for God and mocked by his own thirst.
1945,DAYBREAK,
1946,DAYBREAK,"Spirit of Beauty, mother of delight,"
1947,DAYBREAK,Thou fairest offspring of Omnipotence
1948,DAYBREAK,"Inhabiting this lofty lone abode,"
1949,DAYBREAK,Speak to my heart again and set me free
1950,DAYBREAK,From all these doubts that darken earth and
1951,DAYBREAK,heaven!
1952,DAYBREAK,Who sent thee forth into the wilderness
1953,DAYBREAK,To bless and comfort all who see thy face?
1954,DAYBREAK,Who clad thee in this more than royal robe
1955,DAYBREAK,Of rainbows? Who designed these jewelled
1956,DAYBREAK,thrones
1957,DAYBREAK,"For thee, and wrought these glittering palaces?"
1958,DAYBREAK,Who gave thee power upon the soul of man
1959,DAYBREAK,To lift him up through wonder into joy?
1960,DAYBREAK,"God! let the radiant cliffs bear witness, God!"
1961,DAYBREAK,"Let all the shining pillars signal, God!"
1962,DAYBREAK,"He only, on the mystic loom of light,"
1963,DAYBREAK,Hath woven webs of loveliness to clothe
1964,DAYBREAK,His most majestic works: and He alone
1965,DAYBREAK,Hath delicately wrought the cactus-flower
1966,DAYBREAK,To star the desert floor with rosy bloom.
1967,DAYBREAK,
1968,DAYBREAK,"O Beauty, handiwork of the Most High,"
1969,DAYBREAK,"Where'er thou art He tells his Love to man,"

1971,DAYBREAK,
1972,DAYBREAK,"Now, far beyond all language and all art"
1973,DAYBREAK,"In thy wild splendour, Canyon marvellous,"
1974,DAYBREAK,The secret of thy stillness lies unveiled
1975,DAYBREAK,In worldless worship! This is holy ground;

1977,DAYBREAK,"Garden of Temples filled with Silent Praise,"

2139,VII,"Good cheer to help me bear the traveller's load,"
2140,VII,"And, for the hours of rest that come between,"
2141,VII,An inward joy in all things heard and seen.
2142,VII,These are the sins I fain
2143,VII,Would have thee take away:
2144,VII,"Malice, and cold disdain,"
2145,VII,"Hot anger, sullen hate,"
2146,VII,"Scorn of the lowly, envy of the great,"
2147,VII,And discontent that casts a shadow gray
2148,VII,On all the brightness of the common day.
2149,VII,These are the things I prize
2150,VII,And hold of dearest worth:
2151,VII,"Light of the sapphire skies,"
2152,VII,"Peace of the silent hills,"
2153,VII,"Shelter of forests, comfort of the grass,"
2154,VII,"Music of birds, murmur of little rills,"

2157,VII,The smell of flowers
2158,VII,"And of the good brown earth,--"
2159,VII,"And best of all, along the way, friendship and mirth."
2160,VII,So let me keep
2161,VII,These treasures of the humble heart
2162,VII,"In true possession, owning them by love;"
2163,VII,And when at last I can no longer move
2164,VII,"Among them freely, but must part"
2165,VII,"From the green fields and from the waters clear,"
2166,VII,Let me not creep
2167,VII,Into some darkened room and hide
2168,VII,From all that makes the world so bright and dear;
2169,VII,But throw the windows wide
2170,VII,To welcome in the light;
2171,VII,"And while I clasp a well-belovèd hand,"
2172,VII,Let me once more have sight
2173,VII,"Of the deep sky and the far-smiling land,--"
2174,VII,"Then gently fall on sleep,"
2175,VII,"And breathe my body back to Nature's care,"
2176,VII,"My spirit out to thee, God of the open air."
