83,PREFACE,
84,PREFACE,This volume consists of lectures delivered during my tenure of the Chair
85,PREFACE,of Poetry at Oxford and not included in _Shakespearean Tragedy_. Most of
86,PREFACE,"them have been enlarged, and all have been revised. As they were given"
87,PREFACE,"at intervals, and the majority before the publication of that book, they"
88,PREFACE,contained repetitions which I have not found it possible wholly to
89,PREFACE,remove. Readers of a lecture published by the University of Manchester
90,PREFACE,on _English Poetry and German Philosophy in the Age of Wordsworth_ will
91,PREFACE,pardon also the restatement of some ideas expressed in it.
92,PREFACE,
93,PREFACE,"The several lectures are dated, as I have been unable to take account of"
94,PREFACE,most of the literature on their subjects published since they were
95,PREFACE,delivered.
96,PREFACE,
97,PREFACE,"They are arranged in the order that seems best to me, but it is of"
98,PREFACE,importance only in the case of the four which deal with the poets of
99,PREFACE,Wordsworth's time.
100,PREFACE,
101,PREFACE,"I am indebted to the Delegates of the University Press, and to the"
102,PREFACE,"proprietors and editors of the _Hibbert Journal_ and the _Albany_,"
103,PREFACE,"_Fortnightly_, and _Quarterly Reviews_, respectively, for permission to"
104,PREFACE,"republish the first, third, fifth, eighth, and ninth lectures. A like"
105,PREFACE,acknowledgment is due for leave to use some sentences of an article on

123,NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,There was an oversight in the first edition which I regret. In adding
124,NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,the note on p. 247 I forgot that I had not referred to Professor Dowden
125,NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"in the lecture on ""Shakespeare the Man."" In everything that I have"
126,NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"written on Shakespeare I am indebted to Professor Dowden, and certainly"

169,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"One who, after twenty years, is restored to the University where he was"
170,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"taught and first tried to teach, and who has received at the hands of"
171,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"his Alma Mater an honour of which he never dreamed, is tempted to speak"
172,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),both of himself and of her. But I remember that you have come to listen
173,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"to my thoughts about a great subject, and not to my feelings about"
174,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),myself; and of Oxford who that holds this Professorship could dare to
175,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"speak, when he recalls the exquisite verse in which one of his"
176,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"predecessors described her beauty, and the prose in which he gently"
177,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),touched on her illusions and protested that they were as nothing when
178,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"set against her age-long warfare with the Philistine? How, again,"
179,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"remembering him and others, should I venture to praise my predecessors?"
180,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"It would be pleasant to do so, and even pleasanter to me and you if,"
181,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"instead of lecturing, I quoted to you some of their best passages. But I"
182,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"could not do this for five years. Sooner or later, my own words would"
183,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"have to come, and the inevitable contrast. Not to sharpen it now, I"
184,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),will be silent concerning them also; and will only assure you that I do
185,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"not forget them, or the greatness of the honour of succeeding them, or"
186,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),the responsibility which it entails.
187,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
188,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),The words 'Poetry for poetry's sake' recall the famous phrase 'Art for
189,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),Art.' It is far from my purpose to examine the possible meanings of that
190,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"phrase, or all the questions it involves. I propose to state briefly"
191,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"what I understand by 'Poetry for poetry's sake,' and then, after"
192,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"guarding against one or two misapprehensions of the formula, to consider"
193,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"more fully a single problem connected with it. And I must premise,"
194,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"without attempting to justify them, certain explanations. We are to"
195,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"consider poetry in its essence, and apart from the flaws which in most"
196,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),poems accompany their poetry. We are to include in the idea of poetry
197,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the metrical form, and not to regard this as a mere accident or a mere"
198,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"vehicle. And, finally, poetry being poems, we are to think of a poem as"
199,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"it actually exists; and, without aiming here at accuracy, we may say"
200,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"that an actual poem is the succession of experiences--sounds, images,"
201,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"thoughts, emotions--through which we pass when we are reading as"
202,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),poetically as we can.[2] Of course this imaginative experience--if I may
203,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),use the phrase for brevity--differs with every reader and every time of
204,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),reading: a poem exists in innumerable degrees. But that insurmountable
205,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),fact lies in the nature of things and does not concern us now.
206,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
207,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),What then does the formula 'Poetry for poetry's sake' tell us about this
208,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"experience? It says, as I understand it, these things. First, this"
209,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"experience is an end in itself, is worth having on its own account, has"
210,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"an intrinsic value. Next, its _poetic_ value is this intrinsic worth"
211,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),alone. Poetry may have also an ulterior value as a means to culture or
212,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"religion; because it conveys instruction, or softens the passions, or"
213,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),furthers a good cause; because it brings the poet fame or money or a
214,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),quiet conscience. So much the better: let it be valued for these reasons
215,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),too. But its ulterior worth neither is nor can directly determine its
216,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),poetic worth as a satisfying imaginative experience; and this is to be
217,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),judged entirely from within. And to these two positions the formula
218,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"would add, though not of necessity, a third. The consideration of"
219,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"ulterior ends, whether by the poet in the act of composing or by the"
220,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"reader in the act of experiencing, tends to lower poetic value. It does"
221,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),so because it tends to change the nature of poetry by taking it out of
222,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"its own atmosphere. For its nature is to be not a part, nor yet a copy,"
223,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"of the real world (as we commonly understand that phrase), but to be a"
224,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"world by itself, independent, complete, autonomous; and to possess it"
225,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"fully you must enter that world, conform to its laws, and ignore for the"
226,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"time the beliefs, aims, and particular conditions which belong to you in"
227,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),the other world of reality.
228,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
229,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),Of the more serious misapprehensions to which these statements may give
230,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),rise I will glance only at one or two. The offensive consequences often
231,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),drawn from the formula 'Art for Art' will be found to attach not to the
232,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"doctrine that Art is an end in itself, but to the doctrine that Art is"
233,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the whole or supreme end of human life. And as this latter doctrine,"
234,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"which seems to me absurd, is in any case quite different from the"
235,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"former, its consequences fall outside my subject. The formula 'Poetry is"
236,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),an end in itself' has nothing to say on the various questions of moral
237,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),judgment which arise from the fact that poetry has its place in a
238,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"many-sided life. For anything it says, the intrinsic value of poetry"
239,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"might be so small, and its ulterior effects so mischievous, that it had"
240,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),better not exist. The formula only tells us that we must not place in
241,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"antithesis poetry and human good, for poetry is one kind of human good;"
242,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),and that we must not determine the intrinsic value of this kind of good
243,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"by direct reference to another. If we do, we shall find ourselves"
244,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),maintaining what we did not expect. If poetic value lies in the
245,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"stimulation of religious feelings, _Lead, kindly Light_ is no better a"
246,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),poem than many a tasteless version of a Psalm: if in the excitement of
247,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"patriotism, why is _Scots, wha hae_ superior to _We don't want to"
248,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"fight?_ if in the mitigation of the passions, the Odes of Sappho will"
249,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"win but little praise: if in instruction, Armstrong's _Art of preserving"
250,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),Health_ should win much.
251,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
252,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Again, our formula may be accused of cutting poetry away from its"
253,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),connection with life. And this accusation raises so huge a problem that
254,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),I must ask leave to be dogmatic as well as brief. There is plenty of
255,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"connection between life and poetry, but it is, so to say, a connection"
256,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),underground. The two may be called different forms of the same thing:
257,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"one of them having (in the usual sense) reality, but seldom fully"
258,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),satisfying imagination; while the other offers something which satisfies
259,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),imagination but has not full 'reality.' They are parallel developments
260,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"which nowhere meet, or, if I may use loosely a word which will be"
261,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"serviceable later, they are analogues. Hence we understand one by help"
262,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"of the other, and even, in a sense, care for one because of the other;"
263,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"but hence also, poetry neither is life, nor, strictly speaking, a copy"
264,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),of it. They differ not only because one has more mass and the other a
265,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"more perfect shape, but because they have different _kinds_ of"
266,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),existence. The one touches us as beings occupying a given position in
267,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"space and time, and having feelings, desires, and purposes due to that"
268,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"position: it appeals to imagination, but appeals to much besides. What"
269,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),meets us in poetry has not a position in the same series of time and
270,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"space, or, if it has or had such a position, it is taken apart from much"
271,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),that belonged to it there;[3] and therefore it makes no direct appeal
272,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"to those feelings, desires, and purposes, but speaks only to"
273,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),contemplative imagination--imagination the reverse of empty or
274,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"emotionless, imagination saturated with the results of 'real'"
275,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"experience, but still contemplative. Thus, no doubt, one main reason why"
276,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),poetry has poetic value for us is that it presents to us in its own way
277,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),something which we meet in another form in nature or life; and yet the
278,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),test of its poetic value for us lies simply in the question whether it
279,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"satisfies our imagination; the rest of us, our knowledge or conscience,"
280,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"for example, judging it only so far as they appear transmuted in our"
281,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"imagination. So also Shakespeare's knowledge or his moral insight,"
282,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Milton's greatness of soul, Shelley's 'hate of hate' and 'love of love,'"
283,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),and that desire to help men or make them happier which may have
284,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"influenced a poet in hours of meditation--all these have, as such, no"
285,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"poetical worth: they have that worth only when, passing through the"
286,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"unity of the poet's being, they reappear as qualities of imagination,"
287,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),and then are indeed mighty powers in the world of poetry.
288,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
289,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"I come to a third misapprehension, and so to my main subject. This"
290,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"formula, it is said, empties poetry of its meaning: it is really a"
291,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),doctrine of form for form's sake. 'It is of no consequence what a poet
292,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"says, so long as he says the thing well. The _what_ is poetically"
293,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"indifferent: it is the _how_ that counts. Matter, subject, content,"
294,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"substance, determines nothing; there is no subject with which poetry may"
295,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"not deal: the form, the treatment, is everything. Nay, more: not only is"
296,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the matter indifferent, but it is the secret of Art to ""eradicate the"
297,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"matter by means of the form,""'--phrases and statements like these meet"
298,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),us everywhere in current criticism of literature and the other arts.
299,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),They are the stock-in-trade of writers who understand of them little
300,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),more than the fact that somehow or other they are not 'bourgeois.' But
301,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"we find them also seriously used by writers whom we must respect,"
302,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),whether they are anonymous or not; something like one or another of them
303,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"might be quoted, for example, from Professor Saintsbury, the late R. A."
304,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"M. Stevenson, Schiller, Goethe himself; and they are the watchwords of a"
305,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"school in the one country where Aesthetics has flourished. They come, as"
306,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"a rule, from men who either practise one of the arts, or, from study of"
307,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"it, are interested in its methods. The general reader--a being so"
308,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),general that I may say what I will of him--is outraged by them. He feels
309,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),that he is being robbed of almost all that he cares for in a work of
310,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"art. 'You are asking me,' he says, 'to look at the Dresden Madonna as if"
311,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),it were a Persian rug. You are telling me that the poetic value of
312,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"_Hamlet_ lies solely in its style and versification, and that my"
313,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),interest in the man and his fate is only an intellectual or moral
314,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"interest. You allege that, if I want to enjoy the poetry of _Crossing"
315,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the Bar_, I must not mind what Tennyson says there, but must consider"
316,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),solely his way of saying it. But in that case I can care no more for a
317,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),poem than I do for a set of nonsense verses; and I do not believe that
318,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),the authors of _Hamlet_ and _Crossing the Bar_ regarded their poems
319,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),thus.'
320,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
321,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"These antitheses of subject, matter, substance on the one side, form,"
322,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"treatment, handling on the other, are the field through which I"
323,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"especially want, in this lecture, to indicate a way. It is a field of"
324,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),battle; and the battle is waged for no trivial cause; but the cries of
325,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),the combatants are terribly ambiguous. Those phrases of the so-called
326,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),formalist may each mean five or six different things. Taken in one sense
327,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),they seem to me chiefly true; taken as the general reader not
328,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"unnaturally takes them, they seem to me false and mischievous. It would"
329,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),be absurd to pretend that I can end in a few minutes a controversy
330,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"which concerns the ultimate nature of Art, and leads perhaps to problems"
331,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"not yet soluble; but we can at least draw some plain distinctions which,"
332,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"in this controversy, are too often confused."
333,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
334,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"In the first place, then, let us take 'subject' in one particular sense;"
335,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"let us understand by it that which we have in view when, looking at the"
336,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"title of an un-read poem, we say that the poet has chosen this or that"
337,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"for his subject. The subject, in this sense, so far as I can discover,"
338,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"is generally something, real or imaginary, as it exists in the minds of"
339,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),fairly cultivated people. The subject of _Paradise Lost_ would be the
340,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),story of the Fall as that story exists in the general imagination of a
341,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),Bible-reading people. The subject of Shelley's stanzas _To a Skylark_
342,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"would be the ideas which arise in the mind of an educated person when,"
343,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"without knowing the poem, he hears the word 'skylark'. If the title of a"
344,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"poem conveys little or nothing to us, the 'subject' appears to be either"
345,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),what we should gather by investigating the title in a dictionary or
346,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"other book of the kind, or else such a brief suggestion as might be"
347,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"offered by a person who had read the poem, and who said, for example,"
348,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),that the subject of _The Ancient Mariner_ was a sailor who killed an
349,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),albatross and suffered for his deed.
350,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
351,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Now the subject, in this sense (and I intend to use the word in no"
352,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"other), is not, as such, inside the poem, but outside it. The contents"
353,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),of the stanzas _To a Skylark_ are not the ideas suggested by the work
354,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),'skylark' to the average man; they belong to Shelley just as much as the
355,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"language does. The subject, therefore, is not the matter _of_ the poem"
356,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"at all; and its opposite is not the _form_ of the poem, but the whole"
357,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"poem. The subject is one thing; the poem, matter and form alike, another"
358,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"thing. This being so, it is surely obvious that the poetic value cannot"
359,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"lie in the subject, but lies entirely in its opposite, the poem. How"
360,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),can the subject determine the value when on one and the same subject
361,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),poems may be written of all degrees of merit and demerit; or when a
362,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"perfect poem may be composed on a subject so slight as a pet sparrow,"
363,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"and, if Macaulay may be trusted, a nearly worthless poem on a subject so"
364,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),stupendous as the omnipresence of the Deity? The 'formalist' is here
365,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),perfectly right. Nor is he insisting on something unimportant. He is
366,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),fighting against our tendency to take the work of art as a mere copy or
367,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"reminder of something already in our heads, or at the best as a"
368,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),suggestion of some idea as little removed as possible from the familiar.
369,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"The sightseer who promenades a picture-gallery, remarking that this"
370,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"portrait is so like his cousin, or that landscape the very image of his"
371,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"birthplace, or who, after satisfying himself that one picture is about"
372,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Elijah, passes on rejoicing to discover the subject, and nothing but the"
373,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"subject, of the next--what is he but an extreme example of this"
374,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"tendency? Well, but the very same tendency vitiates much of our"
375,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"criticism, much criticism of Shakespeare, for example, which, with all"
376,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"its cleverness and partial truth, still shows that the critic never"
377,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),passed from his own mind into Shakespeare's; and it may be traced even
378,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"in so fine a critic as Coleridge, as when he dwarfs the sublime struggle"
379,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),of Hamlet into the image of his own unhappy weakness. Hazlitt by no
380,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"means escaped its influence. Only the third of that great trio, Lamb,"
381,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),appears almost always to have rendered the conception of the composer.
382,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
383,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Again, it is surely true that we cannot determine beforehand what"
384,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"subjects are fit for Art, or name any subject on which a good poem might"
385,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"not possibly be written. To divide subjects into two groups, the"
386,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"beautiful or elevating, and the ugly or vicious, and to judge poems"
387,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"according as their subjects belong to one of these groups or the other,"
388,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"is to fall into the same pit, to confuse with our pre-conceptions the"
389,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),meaning of the poet. What the thing is in the poem he is to be judged
390,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"by, not by the thing as it was before he touched it; and how can we"
391,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),venture to say beforehand that he cannot make a true poem out of
392,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),something which to us was merely alluring or dull or revolting? The
393,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"question whether, having done so, he ought to publish his poem; whether"
394,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),the thing in the poet's work will not be still confused by the
395,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),incompetent Puritan or the incompetent sensualist with the thing in
396,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"_his_ mind, does not touch this point: it is a further question, one of"
397,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"ethics, not of art. No doubt the upholders of 'Art for art's sake' will"
398,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"generally be in favour of the courageous course, of refusing to"
399,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),sacrifice the better or stronger part of the public to the weaker or
400,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),worse; but their maxim in no way binds them to this view. Rossetti
401,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"suppressed one of the best of his sonnets, a sonnet chosen for"
402,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"admiration by Tennyson, himself extremely sensitive about the moral"
403,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"effect of poetry; suppressed it, I believe, because it was called"
404,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),fleshly. One may regret Rossetti's judgment and at the same time respect
405,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),his scrupulousness; but in any case he judged in his capacity of
406,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"citizen, not in his capacity of artist."
407,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
408,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"So far then the 'formalist' appears to be right. But he goes too far, I"
409,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"think, if he maintains that the subject is indifferent and that all"
410,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),subjects are the same to poetry. And he does not prove his point by
411,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"observing that a good poem might be written on a pin's head, and a bad"
412,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),one on the Fall of Man. That truth shows that the subject _settles_
413,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"nothing, but not that it counts for nothing. The Fall of Man is really a"
414,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"more favourable subject than a pin's head. The Fall of Man, that is to"
415,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"say, offers opportunities of poetic effects wider in range and more"
416,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"penetrating in appeal. And the fact is that such a subject, as it exists"
417,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"in the general imagination, has some aesthetic value before the poet"
418,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"touches it. It is, as you may choose to call it, an inchoate poem or"
419,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),the débris of a poem. It is not an abstract idea or a bare isolated
420,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"fact, but an assemblage of figures, scenes, actions, and events, which"
421,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),already appeal to emotional imagination; and it is already in some
422,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),degree organized and formed. In spite of this a bad poet would make a
423,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),bad poem on it; but then we should say he was unworthy of the subject.
424,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),And we should not say this if he wrote a bad poem on a pin's head.
425,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Conversely, a good poem on a pin's head would almost certainly transform"
426,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),its subject far more than a good poem on the Fall of Man. It might
427,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"revolutionize its subject so completely that we should say, 'The subject"
428,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"may be a pin's head, but the substance of the poem has very little to do"
429,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),with it.'
430,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
431,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"This brings us to another and a different antithesis. Those figures,"
432,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"scenes, events, that form part of the subject called the Fall of Man,"
433,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),are not the substance of _Paradise Lost_; but in _Paradise Lost_ there
434,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"are figures, scenes, and events resembling them in some degree. These,"
435,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"with much more of the same kind, may be described as its substance, and"
436,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"may then be contrasted with the measured language of the poem, which"
437,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),will be called its form. Subject is the opposite not of form but of the
438,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"whole poem. Substance is within the poem, and its opposite, form, is"
439,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"also within the poem. I am not criticizing this antithesis at present,"
440,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),but evidently it is quite different from the other. It is practically
441,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the distinction used in the old-fashioned criticism of epic and drama,"
442,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"and it flows down, not unsullied, from Aristotle. Addison, for example,"
443,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"in examining _Paradise Lost_ considers in order the fable, the"
444,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"characters, and the sentiments; these will be the substance: then he"
445,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"considers the language, that is, the style and numbers; this will be the"
446,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"form. In like manner, the substance or meaning of a lyric may be"
447,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),distinguished from the form.
448,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
449,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),Now I believe it will be found that a large part of the controversy we
450,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),are dealing with arises from a confusion between these two distinctions
451,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"of substance and form, and of subject and poem. The extreme formalist"
452,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),lays his whole weight on the form because he thinks its opposite is the
453,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"mere subject. The general reader is angry, but makes the same mistake,"
454,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),and gives to the subject praises that rightly belong to the
455,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),substance[4]. I will read an example of what I mean. I can only explain
456,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),the following words of a good critic by supposing that for the moment he
457,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"has fallen into this confusion: 'The mere matter of all poetry--to wit,"
458,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),the appearances of nature and the thoughts and feelings of men--being
459,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"unalterable, it follows that the difference between poet and poet will"
460,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"depend upon the manner of each in applying language, metre, rhyme,"
461,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"cadence, and what not, to this invariable material.' What has become"
462,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"here of the substance of _Paradise Lost_--the story, scenery,"
463,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"characters, sentiments, as they are in the poem? They have vanished"
464,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"clean away. Nothing is left but the form on one side, and on the other"
465,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"not even the subject, but a supposed invariable material, the"
466,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),appearances of nature and the thoughts and feelings of men. Is it
467,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),surprising that the whole value should then be found in the form?
468,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
469,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),So far we have assumed that this antithesis of substance and form is
470,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"valid, and that it always has one meaning. In reality it has several,"
471,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"but we will leave it in its present shape, and pass to the question of"
472,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"its validity. And this question we are compelled to raise, because we"
473,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),have to deal with the two contentions that the poetic value lies wholly
474,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"or mainly in the substance, and that it lies wholly or mainly in the"
475,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"form. Now these contentions, whether false or true, may seem at least to"
476,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"be clear; but we shall find, I think, that they are both of them false,"
477,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),or both of them nonsense: false if they concern anything outside the
478,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"poem, nonsense if they apply to something in it. For what do they"
479,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"evidently imply? They imply that there are in a poem two parts, factors,"
480,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"or components, a substance and a form; and that you can conceive them"
481,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"distinctly and separately, so that when you are speaking of the one you"
482,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"are not speaking of the other. Otherwise how can you ask the question,"
483,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"In which of them does the value lie? But really in a poem, apart from"
484,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"defects, there are no such factors or components; and therefore it is"
485,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),strictly nonsense to ask in which of them the value lies. And on the
486,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"other hand, if the substance and the form referred to are not in the"
487,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"poem, then both the contentions are false, for its poetic value lies in"
488,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),itself.
489,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
490,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"What I mean is neither new nor mysterious; and it will be clear, I"
491,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"believe, to any one who reads poetry poetically and who closely examines"
492,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"his experience. When you are reading a poem, I would ask--not analysing"
493,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"it, and much less criticizing it, but allowing it, as it proceeds, to"
494,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),make its full impression on you through the exertion of your recreating
495,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),imagination--do you then apprehend and enjoy as one thing a certain
496,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"meaning or substance, and as another thing certain articulate sounds,"
497,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"and do you somehow compound these two? Surely you do not, any more than"
498,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"you apprehend apart, when you see some one smile, those lines in the"
499,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"face which express a feeling, and the feeling that the lines express."
500,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Just as there the lines and their meaning are to you one thing, not two,"
501,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"so in poetry the meaning and the sounds are one: there is, if I may put"
502,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"it so, a resonant meaning, or a meaning resonance. If you read the line,"
503,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"'The sun is warm, the sky is clear,' you do not experience separately"
504,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the image of a warm sun and clear sky, on the one side, and certain"
505,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),unintelligible rhythmical sounds on the other; nor yet do you experience
506,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"them together, side by side; but you experience the one _in_ the other."
507,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"And in like manner, when you are really reading _Hamlet_, the action and"
508,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),the characters are not something which you conceive apart from the
509,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"words; you apprehend them from point to point _in_ the words, and the"
510,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"words as expressions of them. Afterwards, no doubt, when you are out of"
511,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the poetic experience but remember it, you may by analysis decompose"
512,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"this unity, and attend to a substance more or less isolated, and a form"
513,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"more or less isolated. But these are things in your analytic head, not"
514,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"in the poem, which is _poetic_ experience. And if you want to have the"
515,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"poem again, you cannot find it by adding together these two products of"
516,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),decomposition; you can only find it by passing back into poetic
517,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"experience. And then what you recover is no aggregate of factors, it is"
518,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),a unity in which you can no more separate a substance and a form than
519,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"you can separate living blood and the life in the blood. This unity has,"
520,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"if you like, various 'aspects' or 'sides,' but they are not factors or"
521,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"parts; if you try to examine one, you find it is also the other. Call"
522,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"them substance and form if you please, but these are not the"
523,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),reciprocally exclusive substance and form to which the two contentions
524,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"_must_ refer. They do not 'agree,' for they are not apart: they are one"
525,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"thing from different points of view, and in that sense identical. And"
526,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"this identity of content and form, you will say, is no accident; it is"
527,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"of the essence of poetry in so far as it is poetry, and of all art in so"
528,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),far as it is art. Just as there is in music not sound on one side and a
529,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"meaning on the other, but expressive sound, and if you ask what is the"
530,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),meaning you can only answer by pointing to the sounds; just as in
531,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"painting there is not a meaning _plus_ paint, but a meaning _in_ paint,"
532,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"or significant paint, and no man can really express the meaning in any"
533,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),other way than in paint and in _this_ paint; so in a poem the true
534,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),content and the true form neither exist nor can be imagined apart. When
535,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),then you are asked whether the value of a poem lies in a substance got
536,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"by decomposing the poem, and present, as such, only in reflective"
537,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"analysis, or whether the value lies in a form arrived at and existing in"
538,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the same way, you will answer, 'It lies neither in one, nor in the"
539,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"other, nor in any addition of them, but in the poem, where they are"
540,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),not.'
541,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
542,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"We have then, first, an antithesis of subject and poem. This is clear"
543,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),and valid; and the question in which of them does the value lie is
544,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"intelligible; and its answer is, In the poem. We have next a distinction"
545,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"of substance and form. If the substance means ideas, images, and the"
546,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"like taken alone, and the form means the measured language taken by"
547,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"itself, this is a possible distinction, but it is a distinction of"
548,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"things not in the poem, and the value lies in neither of them. If"
549,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"substance and form mean anything _in_ the poem, then each is involved in"
550,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the other, and the question in which of them the value lies has no"
551,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"sense. No doubt you may say, speaking loosely, that in this poet or poem"
552,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the aspect of substance is the more noticeable, and in that the aspect"
553,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"of form; and you may pursue interesting discussions on this basis,"
554,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),though no principle or ultimate question of value is touched by them.
555,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"And apart from that question, of course, I am not denying the usefulness"
556,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),and necessity of the distinction. We cannot dispense with it. To
557,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"consider separately the action or the characters of a play, and"
558,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"separately its style or versification, is both legitimate and valuable,"
559,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),so long as we remember what we are doing. But the true critic in
560,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"speaking of these apart does not really think of them apart; the whole,"
561,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the poetic experience, of which they are but aspects, is always in his"
562,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"mind; and he is always aiming at a richer, truer, more intense"
563,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"repetition of that experience. On the other hand, when the question of"
564,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"principle, of poetic value, is raised, these aspects _must_ fall apart"
565,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"into components, separately conceivable; and then there arise two"
566,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"heresies, equally false, that the value lies in one of two things, both"
567,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"of which are outside the poem, and therefore where its value cannot lie."
568,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
569,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),On the heresy of the separable substance a few additional words will
570,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"suffice. This heresy is seldom formulated, but perhaps some unconscious"
571,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),holder of it may object: 'Surely the action and the characters of
572,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"_Hamlet_ are in the play; and surely I can retain these, though I have"
573,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"forgotten all the words. I admit that I do not possess the whole poem,"
574,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"but I possess a part, and the most important part.' And I would answer:"
575,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"'If we are not concerned with any question of principle, I accept all"
576,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"that you say except the last words, which do raise such a question."
577,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Speaking loosely, I agree that the action and characters, as you perhaps"
578,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"conceive them, together with a great deal more, are in the poem. Even"
579,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"then, however, you must not claim to possess all of this kind that is in"
580,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),the poem; for in forgetting the words you must have lost innumerable
581,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"details of the action and the characters. And, when the question of"
582,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"value is raised, I must insist that the action and characters, as you"
583,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"conceive them, are not in _Hamlet_ at all. If they are, point them out."
584,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),You cannot do it. What you find at any moment of that succession of
585,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"experiences called _Hamlet_ is words. In these words, to speak loosely"
586,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"again, the action and characters (more of them than you can conceive"
587,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"apart) are focussed; but your experience is not a combination of them,"
588,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"as ideas, on the one side, with certain sounds on the other; it is an"
589,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),experience of something in which the two are indissolubly fused. If you
590,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"deny this, to be sure I can make no answer, or can only answer that I"
591,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"have reason to believe that you cannot read poetically, or else are"
592,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"misinterpreting your experience. But if you do not deny this, then you"
593,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"will admit that the action and characters of the poem, as you separately"
594,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"imagine them, are no part of it, but a product of it in your reflective"
595,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"imagination, a faint analogue of one aspect of it taken in detachment"
596,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"from the whole. Well, I do not dispute, I would even insist, that, in"
597,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the case of so long a poem as _Hamlet_, it may be necessary from time to"
598,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"time to interrupt the poetic experience, in order to enrich it by"
599,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"forming such a product and dwelling on it. Nor, in a wide sense of"
600,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"""poetic,"" do I question the poetic value of this product, as you think"
601,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),of it apart from the poem. It resembles our recollections of the heroes
602,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"of history or legend, who move about in our imaginations, ""forms more"
603,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"real than living man,"" and are worth much to us though we do not"
604,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"remember anything they said. Our ideas and images of the ""substance"" of"
605,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"a poem have this poetic value, and more, if they are at all adequate."
606,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"But they cannot determine the poetic value of the poem, for (not to"
607,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"speak of the competing claims of the ""form"") nothing that is outside the"
608,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"poem can do that, and they, as such, are outside it.'[5]"
609,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
610,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),Let us turn to the so-called form--style and versification. There is no
611,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),such thing as mere form in poetry. All form is expression. Style may
612,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),have indeed a certain aesthetic worth in partial abstraction from the
613,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"particular matter it conveys, as in a well-built sentence you may take"
614,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"pleasure in the build almost apart from the meaning. Even so, style is"
615,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"expressive--presents to sense, for example, the order, ease, and"
616,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),rapidity with which ideas move in the writer's mind--but it is not
617,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),expressive of the meaning of that particular sentence. And it is
618,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"possible, interrupting poetic experience, to decompose it and abstract"
619,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),for comparatively separate consideration this nearly formal element of
620,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),style. But the aesthetic value of style so taken is not considerable;[6]
621,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),you could not read with pleasure for an hour a composition which had no
622,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),other merit. And in poetic experience you never apprehend this value by
623,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"itself; the style is here expressive also of a particular meaning, or"
624,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),rather is one aspect of that unity whose other aspect is meaning. So
625,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),that what you apprehend may be called indifferently an expressed meaning
626,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),or a significant form. Perhaps on this point I may in Oxford appeal to
627,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"authority, that of Matthew Arnold and Walter Pater, the latter at any"
628,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),rate an authority whom the formalist will not despise. What is the gist
629,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"of Pater's teaching about style, if it is not that in the end the one"
630,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"virtue of style is truth or adequacy; that the word, phrase, sentence,"
631,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"should express perfectly the writer's perception, feeling, image, or"
632,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"thought; so that, as we read a descriptive phrase of Keats's, we"
633,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"exclaim, 'That is the thing itself'; so that, to quote Arnold, the words"
634,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"are 'symbols equivalent with the thing symbolized,' or, in our technical"
635,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"language, a form identical with its content? Hence in true poetry it is,"
636,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"in strictness, impossible to express the meaning in any but its own"
637,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"words, or to change the words without changing the meaning. A"
638,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),translation of such poetry is not really the old meaning in a fresh
639,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"dress; it is a new product, something like the poem, though, if one"
640,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"chooses to say so, more like it in the aspect of meaning than in the"
641,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),aspect of form.
642,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
643,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"No one who understands poetry, it seems to me, would dispute this, were"
644,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"it not that, falling away from his experience, or misled by theory, he"
645,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),takes the word 'meaning' in a sense almost ludicrously inapplicable to
646,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"poetry. People say, for instance, 'steed' and 'horse' have the same"
647,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"meaning; and in bad poetry they have, but not in poetry that _is_"
648,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),poetry.
649,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
650,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),'Bring forth the horse!' The horse was brought:
651,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),In truth he was a noble steed!
652,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
653,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"says Byron in _Mazeppa_. If the two words mean the same here, transpose"
654,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),them:
655,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
656,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),'Bring forth the steed!' The steed was brought:
657,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),In truth he was a noble horse!
658,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
659,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),and ask again if they mean the same. Or let me take a line certainly
660,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),very free from 'poetic diction':
661,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
662,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"To be or not to be, that is the question."
663,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
664,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),You may say that this means the same as 'What is just now occupying my
665,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),attention is the comparative disadvantages of continuing to live or
666,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"putting an end to myself.' And for practical purposes--the purpose, for"
667,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"example, of a coroner--it does. But as the second version altogether"
668,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"misrepresents the speaker at that moment of his existence, while the"
669,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"first does represent him, how can they for any but a practical or"
670,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),logical purpose be said to have the same sense? Hamlet was well able to
671,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"'unpack his heart with words,' but he will not unpack it with our"
672,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),paraphrases.
673,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
674,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),These considerations apply equally to versification. If I take the
675,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),famous line which describes how the souls of the dead stood waiting by
676,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the river, imploring a passage from Charon:"
677,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
678,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),Tendebantque manus ripae ulterioris amore;
679,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
680,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"and if I translate it, 'and were stretching forth their hands in longing"
681,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"for the further bank,' the charm of the original has fled. Why has it"
682,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),fled? Partly (but we have dealt with that) because I have substituted
683,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"for five words, and those the words of Virgil, twelve words, and those"
684,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),my own. In some measure because I have turned into rhythmless prose a
685,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"line of verse which, as mere sound, has unusual beauty. But much more"
686,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),because in doing so I have also changed the _meaning_ of Virgil's line.
687,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),What that meaning is _I_ cannot say: Virgil has said it. But I can see
688,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"this much, that the translation conveys a far less vivid picture of the"
689,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"outstretched hands and of their remaining outstretched, and a far less"
690,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),poignant sense of the distance of the shore and the longing of the
691,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),souls. And it does so partly because this picture and this sense are
692,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"conveyed not only by the obvious meaning of the words, but through the"
693,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"long-drawn sound of 'tendebantque,' through the time occupied by the"
694,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"five syllables and therefore by the idea of 'ulterioris,' and through"
695,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),the identity of the long sound 'or' in the penultimate syllables of
696,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"'ulterioris amore'--all this, and much more, apprehended not in this"
697,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"analytical fashion, nor as _added_ to the beauty of mere sound and to"
698,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the obvious meaning, but in unity with them and so as expressive of the"
699,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),poetic meaning of the whole.
700,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
701,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"It is always so in fine poetry. The value of versification, when it is"
702,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"indissolubly fused with meaning, can hardly be exaggerated. The gift for"
703,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"feeling it, even more perhaps than the gift for feeling the value of"
704,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"style, is the _specific_ gift for poetry, as distinguished from other"
705,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"arts. But versification, taken, as far as possible, all by itself, has a"
706,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"very different worth. Some aesthetic worth it has; how much, you may"
707,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),experience by reading poetry in a language of which you do not
708,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"understand a syllable.[7] The pleasure is quite appreciable, but it is"
709,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"not great; nor in actual poetic experience do you meet with it, as such,"
710,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"at all. For, I repeat, it is not _added_ to the pleasure of the meaning"
711,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),when you read poetry that you do understand: by some mystery the music
712,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"is then the music _of_ the meaning, and the two are one. However fond"
713,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"of versification you might be, you would tire very soon of reading"
714,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),verses in Chinese; and before long of reading Virgil and Dante if you
715,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),were ignorant of their languages. But take the music as it is _in_ the
716,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"poem, and there is a marvellous change. Now"
717,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
718,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),It gives a very echo to the seat
719,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),Where love is throned;
720,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
721,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"or 'carries far into your heart,' almost like music itself, the sound"
722,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
723,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Of old, unhappy, far-off things"
724,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),And battles long ago.
725,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
726,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),What then is to be said of the following sentence of the critic quoted
727,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),before: 'But when any one who knows what poetry is reads--
728,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
729,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),Our noisy years seem moments in the being
730,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Of the eternal silence,"
731,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
732,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"he sees that, quite independently of the meaning, ... there is one note"
733,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),added to the articulate music of the world--a note that never will leave
734,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),off resounding till the eternal silence itself gulfs it' must think that
735,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),the writer is deceiving himself. For I could quite understand his
736,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"enthusiasm, if it were an enthusiasm for the music of the meaning; but"
737,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"as for the music, 'quite independently of the meaning,' so far as I can"
738,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"hear it thus (and I doubt if any one who knows English can quite do so),"
739,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"I find it gives some pleasure, but only a trifling pleasure. And indeed"
740,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"I venture to doubt whether, considered as mere sound, the words are at"
741,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"all exceptionally beautiful, as Virgil's line certainly is."
742,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
743,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"When poetry answers to its idea and is purely or almost purely poetic,"
744,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),we find the identity of form and content; and the degree of purity
745,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),attained may be tested by the degree in which we feel it hopeless to
746,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),convey the effect of a poem or passage in any form but its own. Where
747,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the notion of doing so is simply ludicrous, you have quintessential"
748,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"poetry. But a great part even of good poetry, especially in long works,"
749,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),is of a mixed nature; and so we find in it no more than a partial
750,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),agreement of a form and substance which remain to some extent distinct.
751,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),This is so in many passages of Shakespeare (the greatest of poets when
752,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"he chose, but not always a conscientious poet); passages where something"
753,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"was wanted for the sake of the plot, but he did not care about it or was"
754,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),hurried. The conception of the passage is then distinct from the
755,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"execution, and neither is inspired. This is so also, I think, wherever"
756,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),we can truly speak of merely decorative effect. We seem to perceive that
757,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"the poet had a truth or fact--philosophical, agricultural,"
758,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"social--distinctly before him, and then, as we say, clothed it in"
759,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"metrical and coloured language. Most argumentative, didactic, or satiric"
760,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),poems are partly of this kind; and in imaginative poems anything which
761,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),is really a mere 'conceit' is mere decoration. We often deceive
762,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"ourselves in this matter, for what we call decoration has often a new"
763,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),and genuinely poetic content of its own; but wherever there is mere
764,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"decoration, we judge the poetry to be not wholly poetic. And so when"
765,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Wordsworth inveighed against poetic diction, though he hurled his darts"
766,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"rather wildly, what he was rightly aiming at was a phraseology, not the"
767,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"living body of a new content, but the mere worn-out body of an old"
768,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),one.[8]
769,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
770,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),In pure poetry it is otherwise. Pure poetry is not the decoration of a
771,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),preconceived and clearly defined matter: it springs from the creative
772,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),impulse of a vague imaginative mass pressing for development and
773,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"definition. If the poet already knew exactly what he meant to say, why"
774,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),should he write the poem? The poem would in fact already be written. For
775,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"only its completion can reveal, even to him, exactly what he wanted."
776,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"When he began and while he was at work, he did not possess his meaning;"
777,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),it possessed him. It was not a fully formed soul asking for a body: it
778,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),was an inchoate soul in the inchoate body of perhaps two or three vague
779,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),ideas and a few scattered phrases. The growing of this body into its
780,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),full stature and perfect shape was the same thing as the gradual
781,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),self-definition of the meaning.[9] And this is the reason why such poems
782,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"strike us as creations, not manufactures, and have the magical effect"
783,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"which mere decoration cannot produce. This is also the reason why, if we"
784,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"insist on asking for the meaning of such a poem, we can only be answered"
785,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),'It means itself.'
786,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
787,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),And so at last I may explain why I have troubled myself and you with
788,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),what may seem an arid controversy about mere words. It is not so. These
789,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),heresies which would make poetry a compound of two factors--a matter
790,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"common to it with the merest prose, _plus_ a poetic form, as the one"
791,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"heresy says: a poetical substance _plus_ a negligible form, as the other"
792,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"says--are not only untrue, they are injurious to the dignity of poetry."
793,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),In an age already inclined to shrink from those higher realms where
794,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"poetry touches religion and philosophy, the formalist heresy encourages"
795,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"men to taste poetry as they would a fine wine, which has indeed an"
796,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"aesthetic value, but a small one. And then the natural man, finding an"
797,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"empty form, hurls into it the matter of cheap pathos, rancid sentiment,"
798,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"vulgar humour, bare lust, ravenous vanity--everything which, in"
799,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Schiller's phrase,[10] the form should extirpate, but which no mere form"
800,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),can extirpate. And the other heresy--which is indeed rather a practice
801,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),than a creed--encourages us in the habit so dear to us of putting our
802,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),own thoughts or fancies into the place of the poet's creation. What he
803,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"meant by _Hamlet_, or the _Ode to a Nightingale_, or _Abt Vogler_, we"
804,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"say, is this or that which we knew already; and so we lose what he had"
805,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"to tell us. But he meant what he said, and said what he meant."
806,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
807,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Poetry in this matter is not, as good critics of painting and music"
808,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"often affirm, different from the other arts; in all of them the content"
809,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"is one thing with the form. What Beethoven meant by his symphony, or"
810,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Turner by his picture, was not something which you can name, but the"
811,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"picture and the symphony. Meaning they have, but _what_ meaning can be"
812,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"said in no language but their own: and we know this, though some strange"
813,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),delusion makes us think the meaning has less worth because we cannot put
814,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"it into words. Well, it is just the same with poetry. But because poetry"
815,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"is words, we vainly fancy that some other words than its own will"
816,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"express its meaning. And they will do so no more--or, if you like to"
817,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"speak loosely, only a trifle more--than words will express the meaning"
818,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),of the Dresden Madonna.[11] Something a little like it they may indeed
819,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"express. And we may find analogues of the meaning of poetry outside it,"
820,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"which may help us to appropriate it. The other arts, the best ideas of"
821,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"philosophy or religion, much that nature and life offer us or force upon"
822,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"us, are akin to it. But they are only akin. Nor is it the expression of"
823,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),them. Poetry does not present to imagination our highest knowledge or
824,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"belief, and much less our dreams and opinions; but it, content and form"
825,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"in unity, embodies in its own irreplaceable way something which embodies"
826,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"itself also in other irreplaceable ways, such as philosophy or religion."
827,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),And just as each of these gives a satisfaction which the other cannot
828,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"possibly give, so we find in poetry, which cannot satisfy the needs they"
829,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"meet, that which by their natures they cannot afford us. But we shall"
830,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),not find it fully if we look for something else.
831,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
832,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"And now, when all is said, the question will still recur, though now in"
833,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"quite another sense, What does poetry mean?[12] This unique expression,"
834,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"which cannot be replaced by any other, still seems to be trying to"
835,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"express something beyond itself. And this, we feel, is also what the"
836,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"other arts, and religion, and philosophy are trying to express: and that"
837,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),is what impels us to seek in vain to translate the one into the other.
838,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"About the best poetry, and not only the best, there floats an atmosphere"
839,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"of infinite suggestion. The poet speaks to us of one thing, but in this"
840,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"one thing there seems to lurk the secret of all. He said what he meant,"
841,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"but his meaning seems to beckon away beyond itself, or rather to expand"
842,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),into something boundless which is only focussed in it; something also
843,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"which, we feel, would satisfy not only the imagination, but the whole of"
844,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"us; that something within us, and without, which everywhere"
845,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
846,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),makes us seem
847,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"To patch up fragments of a dream,"
848,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Part of which comes true, and part"
849,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),Beats and trembles in the heart.
850,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
851,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Those who are susceptible to this effect of poetry find it not only,"
852,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"perhaps not most, in the ideals which she has sometimes described, but"
853,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),in a child's song by Christina Rossetti about a mere crown of
854,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"wind-flowers, and in tragedies like _Lear_, where the sun seems to have"
855,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),set for ever. They hear this spirit murmuring its undertone through the
856,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"_Aeneid_, and catch its voice in the song of Keats's nightingale, and"
857,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"its light upon the figures on the Urn, and it pierces them no less in"
858,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"Shelley's hopeless lament, _O world, O life, O time_, than in the"
859,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),rapturous ecstasy of his _Life of Life_. This all-embracing perfection
860,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"cannot be expressed in poetic words or words of any kind, nor yet in"
861,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"music or in colour, but the suggestion of it is in much poetry, if not"
862,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"all, and poetry has in this suggestion, this 'meaning,' a great part of"
863,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"its value. We do it wrong, and we defeat our own purposes, when we try"
864,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),to bend it to them:
865,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
866,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"We do it wrong, being so majestical,"
867,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),To offer it the show of violence;
868,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"For it is as the air invulnerable,"
869,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),And our vain blows malicious mockery.
870,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),
871,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),It is a spirit. It comes we know not whence. It will not speak at our
872,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),"bidding, nor answer in our language. It is not our servant; it is our"
873,(INAUGURAL LECTURE),master.

882,NOTE A,when we read poetically would be absurd indeed. My object was to suggest
883,NOTE A,to my hearers in passing that it is futile to ask questions about the
884,NOTE A,"end, or substance, or form of poetry, if we forget that a poem is"

897,NOTE A,
898,NOTE A,The passage to which the present note refers raises difficult questions
899,NOTE A,which any attempt at a 'Poetics' ought to discuss. I will mention three.
900,NOTE A,(1) If the experience called a poem varies 'with every reader and every
901,NOTE A,"time of reading' and 'exists in innumerable degrees,' what is the poem"
902,NOTE A,"itself, if there is such a thing? (2) How does a series of successive"
903,NOTE A,experiences form _one_ poem? (3) If the object in the case of poetry and
904,NOTE A,music ('arts of hearing') is a succession somehow and to some extent
905,NOTE A,"unified, how does it differ in this respect from the object in 'arts of"
906,NOTE A,"sight'--a building, a statue, a picture?"
907,NOTE A,
908,NOTE A,
909,NOTE B,NOTE B
910,NOTE B,
911,NOTE B,"A lyric, for example, may arise from 'real' emotions due to transitory"
912,NOTE B,"conditions peculiar to the poet. But these emotions and conditions,"
913,NOTE B,"however interesting biographically, are poetically irrelevant. The poem,"
914,NOTE B,"what the poet _says_, is universal, and is appropriated by people who"
915,NOTE B,live centuries after him and perhaps know nothing of him and his life;
916,NOTE B,and if it arose from mere imagination it is none the worse (or the
917,NOTE B,better) for that. So far as it cannot be appropriated without a
918,NOTE B,"knowledge of the circumstances in which it arose, it is probably, so"
919,NOTE B,"far, faulty (probably, because the difficulty _may_ come from our"
920,NOTE B,distance from the whole mental world of the poet's time and country).
921,NOTE B,
922,NOTE B,What is said in the text applies equally to all the arts. It applies
923,NOTE B,also to such aesthetic apprehension as does not issue in a work of art.
924,NOTE B,And it applies to this apprehension whether the object belongs to
925,NOTE B,'Nature' or to 'Man.' A beautiful landscape is not a 'real' landscape.
926,NOTE B,Much that belongs to the 'real' landscape is ignored when it is
927,NOTE B,apprehended aesthetically; and the painter only carries this unconscious
928,NOTE B,idealisation further when he deliberately alters the 'real' landscape in
929,NOTE B,further ways.
930,NOTE B,
931,NOTE B,"All this does not in the least imply that the 'real' thing, where there"
932,NOTE B,"is one (personal emotion, landscape, historical event, etc.), is of"
933,NOTE B,small importance to the aesthetic apprehension or the work of art. But
934,NOTE B,it is relevant only as it appears _in_ that apprehension or work.
935,NOTE B,
936,NOTE B,If an artist alters a reality (_e.g._ a well-known scene or historical
937,NOTE B,character) so much that his product clashes violently with our familiar
938,NOTE B,"ideas, he may be making a mistake: not because his product is untrue to"
939,NOTE B,"the reality (this by itself is perfectly irrelevant), but because the"
940,NOTE B,'untruth' may make it difficult or impossible for others to appropriate
941,NOTE B,"his product, or because this product may be aesthetically inferior to"
942,NOTE B,the reality even as it exists in the general imagination.

950,NOTE C,"understands the language to read or recite to you poems written in it,"

958,NOTE C,"a poem is always, to speak loosely, influenced by the sense. The bare"
959,NOTE C,"metrical scheme, to go no further, is practically never followed by the"

969,NOTE C,"In the text, therefore, more is admitted than in strictness should be"

982,NOTE D,degree in poeticalness (if I may use the word) is put as a difference
983,NOTE D,"between 'mixed' and 'pure' poetry; and that distinction is, I think,"

987,NOTE D,failure to hold fast the main idea of the lecture. Naturally it would be
988,NOTE D,"most agreeable to me to re-write the paragraph, but if I reprint it and"
989,NOTE D,expose my errors the reader will perhaps be helped to a firmer grasp of
990,NOTE D,that idea.
991,NOTE D,
992,NOTE D,It is true that where poetry is most poetic we feel most decidedly how
993,NOTE D,impossible it is to separate content and form. But where poetry is less
994,NOTE D,"poetic and does not make us feel this unity so decidedly, it does not"
995,NOTE D,follow that the unity is imperfect. Failure or partial failure in this
996,NOTE D,unity is always (as in the case of Shakespeare referred to) a failure on
997,NOTE D,the part of the _poet_ (though it is not always due to the same causes).
998,NOTE D,It does not lie of necessity in the nature of a particular kind of
999,NOTE D,poetry (_e.g._ satire) or in the nature of a particular passage. All
1000,NOTE D,"poetry cannot be equally poetic, but _all_ poetry ought to maintain the"
1001,NOTE D,"unity of content and form, and, in that sense, to be 'pure.' Only in"
1002,NOTE D,"certain kinds, and in certain passages, it is more difficult for the"
1003,NOTE D,poet to maintain it than in others.
1004,NOTE D,
1005,NOTE D,Let us take first the 'passages' and suppose them to occur in one of the
1006,NOTE D,more poetic kinds of poetry. In certain parts of any epic or tragedy
1007,NOTE D,"matter has to be treated which, though necessary to the whole, is not in"
1008,NOTE D,"itself favourable to poetry, or would not in itself be a good 'subject.'"
1009,NOTE D,But it is the business of the poet to do his best to make this matter
1010,NOTE D,"poetry, and pure poetry. And, if he succeeds, the passage, though it"
1011,NOTE D,"will probably be less poetic than the bulk of the poem, will exhibit the"
1012,NOTE D,complete unity of content and form. It will not strike us as a mere
1013,NOTE D,bridge between other passages; it will be enjoyable for itself; and it
1014,NOTE D,will not occur to us to think that the poet was dealing with an
1015,NOTE D,un-poetic 'matter' and found his task difficult or irksome. Shakespeare
1016,NOTE D,frequently does not trouble himself to face this problem and leaves an
1017,NOTE D,"imperfect unity. The conscientious artists, like Virgil, Milton,"
1018,NOTE D,"Tennyson, habitually face, it and frequently solve it.[13] And when they"
1019,NOTE D,"wholly or partially fail, the fault is still _theirs_. It is, in one"
1020,NOTE D,"sense, due to the 'matter,' which set a hard problem; but they would be"
1021,NOTE D,the first to declare that _nothing_ in the poem ought to be only mixedly
1022,NOTE D,poetic.
1023,NOTE D,
1024,NOTE D,"In the same way, satire is not in its nature a highly poetic kind of"
1025,NOTE D,"poetry, but it ought, in its own kind, to be poetry throughout, and"
1026,NOTE D,therefore ought not to show a merely partial unity of content and form.
1027,NOTE D,If the satirist makes us exclaim 'This is sheer prose wonderfully well
1028,NOTE D,"disguised,' that is a fault, and _his_ fault (unless it happens to be"
1029,NOTE D,ours). The idea that a tragedy or lyric could really be reproduced in a
1030,NOTE D,form not its own strikes us as ridiculous; the idea that a satire could
1031,NOTE D,so be reproduced seems much less ridiculous; but if it were true the
1032,NOTE D,satire would not be poetry at all.
1033,NOTE D,
1034,NOTE D,"The reader will now see where, in my judgment, the paragraph is wrong."
1035,NOTE D,"Elsewhere it is, I think, right, though it deals with a subject far too"
1036,NOTE D,"large for a paragraph. This is also true of the next paragraph, which"
1037,NOTE D,"uses the false distinction of 'pure' and 'mixed,' and which will hold in"
1038,NOTE D,various degrees of poetry in various degrees poetical.
1039,NOTE D,
1040,NOTE D,It is of course possible to use a distinction of 'pure' and 'mixed' in
1041,NOTE D,"another sense. Poetry, whatever its kind, would be pure as far as it"
1042,NOTE D,"preserved the unity of content and form; mixed, so far as it failed to"
1043,NOTE D,"do so--in other words, failed to be poetry and was partly prosaic."

1048,NOTE E,"It is possible therefore that the poem, as it existed at certain stages"
1049,NOTE E,"in its growth, may correspond roughly with the poem as it exists in the"
1050,NOTE E,memories of various readers. A reader who is fond of the poem and often
1051,NOTE E,"thinks of it, but remembers only half the words and perhaps fills up the"
1052,NOTE E,"gaps with his own words, may possess something like the poem as it was"
1053,NOTE E,when half-made. There are readers again who retain only what they would
1054,NOTE E,call the 'idea' of the poem; and the poem _may_ have begun from such an
1055,NOTE E,"idea. Others will forget all the words, and will not profess to remember"
1056,NOTE E,"even the 'meaning,' but believe that they possess the 'spirit' of the"
1057,NOTE E,"poem. And what they possess may have, I think, an immense value. The"
1058,NOTE E,"poem, of course, it is not; but it may answer to the state of"
1059,NOTE E,imaginative feeling or emotional imagination which was the germ of the
1060,NOTE E,"poem. This is, in one sense, quite definite: it would not be the germ of"
1061,NOTE E,"a decidedly different poem: but in another sense it is indefinite,"
1062,NOTE E,"comparatively structureless, more a 'stimmung' than an idea."

1072,NOTE F,"regards poetry, such attempts, though they cannot possibly express the"

1074,NOTE F,"apprehension of that meaning. And, although the attempt is still more"
1075,NOTE F,"hazardous in the case of music and painting, I believe it may have a"
1076,NOTE F,similar value. That its results _may_ be absurd or disgusting goes
1077,NOTE F,"without saying, and whether they are ever of use to musicians or the"
1078,NOTE F,musically educated I do not know. But I see no reason why an exceedingly
1079,NOTE F,competent person should not try to indicate the emotional tone of a
1080,NOTE F,"composition, movement, or passage, or the changes of feeling within it,"
1081,NOTE F,"or even, very roughly, the 'idea' he may suppose it to embody (though he"
1082,NOTE F,need not imply that the composer had any of this before his mind). And I

1090,NOTE G,"This new question has 'quite another sense' than that of the question,"
1091,NOTE G,What is the meaning or content expressed by the form of a poem? The new
1092,NOTE G,"question asks, What is it that the _poem_, the unity of this content and"
1093,NOTE G,"form, is trying to express? This 'beyond' is beyond the content as well"
1094,NOTE G,as the form.
1095,NOTE G,
1096,NOTE G,"Of course, I should add, it is not _merely_ beyond them or outside of"
1097,NOTE G,"them. If it were, they (the poem) could not 'suggest' it. They are a"
1098,NOTE G,"partial manifestation of it, and point beyond themselves to it, both"
1099,NOTE G,because they _are_ a manifestation and because this is partial.
1100,NOTE G,
1101,NOTE G,"The same thing is true, not only (as is remarked in the text) of the"
1102,NOTE G,"other arts and of religion and philosophy, but also of what is commonly"
1103,NOTE G,called reality. This reality is a manifestation of a different order
1104,NOTE G,"from poetry, and in certain important respects a much more imperfect"
1105,NOTE G,"manifestation. Hence, as was pointed out (pp. 6, 7, note B), poetry is"
1106,NOTE G,"not a copy of it, but in dealing with it idealises it, and in doing so"
1107,NOTE G,"produces in certain respects a fuller manifestation. On the other hand,"
1108,NOTE G,that imperfect 'reality' has for us a character in which poetry is
1109,NOTE G,"deficient,--the character in virtue of which we call it 'reality.' It"
1110,NOTE G,"is, we feel, thrust upon us, not made by us or by any other man. And in"
1111,NOTE G,"this respect it seems more akin than poetry to that 'beyond,' or"
1112,NOTE G,"absolute, or perfection, which we want, which partially expresses itself"
1113,NOTE G,"in both, and which could not be perfection and could not satisfy us if"
1114,NOTE G,it were not real (though it cannot be real in the same sense as that
1115,NOTE G,imperfect 'reality'). This seems the ultimate ground of the requirement
1116,NOTE G,"that poetry, though no copy of 'reality,' should not be mere 'fancy,'"
1117,NOTE G,"but should refer to, and interpret, that 'reality.' For that reality,"
1118,NOTE G,"however imperfectly it reveals perfection, is at least no mere fancy."
1119,NOTE G,(Not that the merest fancy can fail to reveal something of perfection.)

1180,THE SUBLIME[1],
1181,THE SUBLIME[1],
1182,THE SUBLIME[1],Coleridge used to tell a story about his visit to the Falls of Clyde;
1183,THE SUBLIME[1],"but he told it with such variations that the details are uncertain, and"
1184,THE SUBLIME[1],without regard to truth I shall change it to the shape that suits my
1185,THE SUBLIME[1],"purpose best. After gazing at the Falls for some time, he began to"
1186,THE SUBLIME[1],consider what adjective would answer most precisely to the impression he
1187,THE SUBLIME[1],had received; and he came to the conclusion that the proper word was
1188,THE SUBLIME[1],"'sublime.' Two other tourists arrived, and, standing by him, looked in"
1189,THE SUBLIME[1],"silence at the spectacle. Then, to Coleridge's high satisfaction, the"
1190,THE SUBLIME[1],"gentleman exclaimed, 'It is sublime.' To which the lady responded, 'Yes,"
1191,THE SUBLIME[1],it is the prettiest thing I ever saw.'
1192,THE SUBLIME[1],
1193,THE SUBLIME[1],This poor lady's incapacity (for I assume that Coleridge and her husband
1194,THE SUBLIME[1],"were in the right) is ludicrous, but it is also a little painful."
1195,THE SUBLIME[1],Sublimity and prettiness are qualities separated by so great a distance
1196,THE SUBLIME[1],that our sudden attempt to unite them has a comically incongruous
1197,THE SUBLIME[1],effect. At the same time the first of these qualities is so exalted that
1198,THE SUBLIME[1],the exhibition of entire inability to perceive it is distressing.
1199,THE SUBLIME[1],"Astonishment, rapture, awe, even self-abasement, are among the emotions"
1200,THE SUBLIME[1],evoked by sublimity. Many would be inclined to pronounce it the very
1201,THE SUBLIME[1],"highest of all the forms assumed by beauty, whether in nature or in"
1202,THE SUBLIME[1],works of imagination.
1203,THE SUBLIME[1],
1204,THE SUBLIME[1],"I propose to make some remarks on this quality, and even to attempt some"
1205,THE SUBLIME[1],sort of answer to the question what sublimity is. I say 'some sort of
1206,THE SUBLIME[1],"answer,' because the question is large and difficult, and I can deal"
1207,THE SUBLIME[1],with it only in outline and by drawing artificial limits round it and
1208,THE SUBLIME[1],refusing to discuss certain presuppositions on which the answer rests.
1209,THE SUBLIME[1],What I mean by these last words will be evident if I begin by referring
1210,THE SUBLIME[1],to a term which will often recur in this lecture--the term 'beauty.'
1211,THE SUBLIME[1],
1212,THE SUBLIME[1],"When we call sublimity a form of beauty, as I did just now, the word"
1213,THE SUBLIME[1],'beauty' is obviously being used in the widest sense. It is the sense
1214,THE SUBLIME[1],which the word bears when we distinguish beauty from goodness and from
1215,THE SUBLIME[1],"truth, or when 'beautiful' is taken to signify anything and everything"
1216,THE SUBLIME[1],"that gives aesthetic satisfaction, or when 'Aesthetics' and 'Philosophy"
1217,THE SUBLIME[1],"of the Beautiful' are used as equivalent expressions. Of beauty, thus"
1218,THE SUBLIME[1],"understood, sublimity is one particular kind among a number of others,"
1219,THE SUBLIME[1],for instance prettiness. But 'beauty' and 'beautiful' have also another
1220,THE SUBLIME[1],"meaning, narrower and more specific, as when we say that a thing is"
1221,THE SUBLIME[1],"pretty but not beautiful, or that it is beautiful but not sublime. The"
1222,THE SUBLIME[1],beauty we have in view here is evidently not the same as beauty in the
1223,THE SUBLIME[1],"wider sense; it is only, like sublimity or prettiness, a particular kind"
1224,THE SUBLIME[1],or mode of that beauty. This ambiguity of the words 'beauty' and
1225,THE SUBLIME[1],"'beautiful' is a great inconvenience, and especially so in a lecture,"
1226,THE SUBLIME[1],where it forces us to add some qualification to the words whenever they
1227,THE SUBLIME[1],occur: but it cannot be helped. (Now that the lecture is printed I am
1228,THE SUBLIME[1],able to avoid these qualifications by printing the words in inverted
1229,THE SUBLIME[1],commas where they bear the narrower sense.)[2]
1230,THE SUBLIME[1],
1231,THE SUBLIME[1],"Now, obviously, all the particular kinds or modes of beauty must have,"
1232,THE SUBLIME[1],"up to a certain point, the same nature. They must all possess that"
1233,THE SUBLIME[1],character in virtue of which they are called beautiful rather than good
1234,THE SUBLIME[1],"or true. And so a philosopher, investigating one of these kinds, would"
1235,THE SUBLIME[1],first have to determine this common nature or character; and then he
1236,THE SUBLIME[1],would go on to ascertain what it is that distinguishes the particular
1237,THE SUBLIME[1],kind from its companions. But here we cannot follow such a method. The
1238,THE SUBLIME[1],nature of beauty in general is so much disputed and so variously defined
1239,THE SUBLIME[1],that to discuss it here by way of preface would be absurd; and on the
1240,THE SUBLIME[1],other hand it would be both presumptuous and useless to assume the truth
1241,THE SUBLIME[1],"of any one account of it. Our only plan, therefore, must be to leave it"
1242,THE SUBLIME[1],"entirely alone, and to consider merely the distinctive character of"
1243,THE SUBLIME[1],"sublimity. Let beauty in general be what it may, what is it that marks"
1244,THE SUBLIME[1],"off _this_ kind of beauty from others, and what is there peculiar in our"
1245,THE SUBLIME[1],state of mind when we are moved to apply to anything the specific
1246,THE SUBLIME[1],epithet 'sublime'?--such is our question. And this plan is not merely
1247,THE SUBLIME[1],"the only possible one, but it is, I believe, quite justifiable, since,"
1248,THE SUBLIME[1],"so far as I can see, the answer to our particular question, unless it is"
1249,THE SUBLIME[1],"pushed further than I propose to go, is unaffected by the differences"
1250,THE SUBLIME[1],"among theories of repute concerning beauty in general. At the same time,"
1251,THE SUBLIME[1],it is essential to realise and always to bear in mind one consequence of
1252,THE SUBLIME[1],this plan; which is that our account of what is peculiar to sublimity
1253,THE SUBLIME[1],will not be an account of sublimity in its full nature. For sublimity is
1254,THE SUBLIME[1],"not those peculiar characteristics alone, it is that _beauty_ which is"
1255,THE SUBLIME[1],"distinguished by them, and a large part of its effect is due to that"
1256,THE SUBLIME[1],"general nature of beauty which it shares with other kinds, and which we"
1257,THE SUBLIME[1],leave unexamined.
1258,THE SUBLIME[1],
1259,THE SUBLIME[1],In considering the question thus defined I propose to start from our
1260,THE SUBLIME[1],common aesthetic experience and to attempt to arrive at an answer by
1261,THE SUBLIME[1],"degrees. It will be understood, therefore, that our first results may"
1262,THE SUBLIME[1],"have to be modified as we proceed. And I will venture to ask my hearers,"
1263,THE SUBLIME[1],"further, to ignore for the time any doubts they may feel whether I am"
1264,THE SUBLIME[1],"right in saying, by way of illustration, that this or that thing is"
1265,THE SUBLIME[1],"sublime. Such differences of opinion scarcely affect our question, which"
1266,THE SUBLIME[1],"is not whether in a given case the epithet is rightly applied, but what"
1267,THE SUBLIME[1],"the epithet signifies. And it has to be borne in mind that, while no two"
1268,THE SUBLIME[1],"kinds of beauty can be quite the same, a _thing_ may very well possess"
1269,THE SUBLIME[1],beauty of two different kinds.
1270,THE SUBLIME[1],
1271,THE SUBLIME[1],Let us begin by placing side by side five terms which represent five of
1272,THE SUBLIME[1],"the many modes of beauty--sublime, grand, 'beautiful,' graceful, pretty."
1273,THE SUBLIME[1],"'Beautiful' is here placed in the middle. Before it come two terms,"
1274,THE SUBLIME[1],"sublime and grand; and beyond it lie two others, graceful and pretty."
1275,THE SUBLIME[1],"Now is it not the case that the first two, though not identical, still"
1276,THE SUBLIME[1],seem to be allied in some respect; that the last two also seem to be
1277,THE SUBLIME[1],"allied in some respect; that in this respect, whatever it may be, these"
1278,THE SUBLIME[1],"two pairs seem to stand apart from one another, and even to stand in"
1279,THE SUBLIME[1],"contrast; that 'beauty,' in this respect, seems to hold a neutral"
1280,THE SUBLIME[1],"position, though perhaps inclining rather to grace than to grandeur; and"
1281,THE SUBLIME[1],"that the extreme terms, sublime and pretty, seem in this respect to be"
1282,THE SUBLIME[1],"the most widely removed; so that this series of five constitutes, in a"
1283,THE SUBLIME[1],"sense, a descending series,--descending not necessarily in value, but in"
1284,THE SUBLIME[1],"some particular respect not yet assigned? If, for example, in the lady's"
1285,THE SUBLIME[1],"answer, 'Yes, it is the prettiest thing I ever saw,' you substitute for"
1286,THE SUBLIME[1],"'prettiest' first 'most graceful,' and then 'most beautiful,' and then"
1287,THE SUBLIME[1],"'grandest,' you will find that your astonishment at her diminishes at"
1288,THE SUBLIME[1],"each step, and that at the last, when she identifies sublimity and"
1289,THE SUBLIME[1],"grandeur, she is guilty no longer of an absurdity, but only of a slight"
1290,THE SUBLIME[1],"anti-climax. If, I may add, she had said 'majestic,' the anti-climax"
1291,THE SUBLIME[1],"would have been slighter still, and, in fact, in one version of the"
1292,THE SUBLIME[1],story Coleridge says that 'majestic' was the word he himself chose.
1293,THE SUBLIME[1],
1294,THE SUBLIME[1],"What then is the 'respect' in question here,--the something or other in"
1295,THE SUBLIME[1],regard to which sublimity and grandeur seemed to be allied with one
1296,THE SUBLIME[1],"another, and to differ decidedly from grace and prettiness? It appears"
1297,THE SUBLIME[1],"to be greatness. Thousands of things are 'beautiful,' graceful, or"
1298,THE SUBLIME[1],"pretty, and yet make no impression of greatness, nay, this impression in"
1299,THE SUBLIME[1],"many cases appears to collide with, and even to destroy, that of grace"
1300,THE SUBLIME[1],"or prettiness, so that if a pretty thing produced it you would cease to"
1301,THE SUBLIME[1],call it pretty. But whatever strikes us as sublime produces an
1302,THE SUBLIME[1],"impression of greatness, and more--of exceeding or even overwhelming"
1303,THE SUBLIME[1],"greatness. And this greatness, further, is apparently no mere"
1304,THE SUBLIME[1],"accompaniment of sublimity, but essential to it: remove the greatness in"
1305,THE SUBLIME[1],"imagination, and the sublimity vanishes. Grandeur, too, seems always to"
1306,THE SUBLIME[1],"possess greatness, though not in this superlative degree; while 'beauty'"
1307,THE SUBLIME[1],"neither invariably possesses it nor tends, like prettiness and grace, to"
1308,THE SUBLIME[1],"exclude it. I will try, not to defend these statements by argument, but"
1309,THE SUBLIME[1],"to develop their meaning by help of illustrations, dismissing from view"
1310,THE SUBLIME[1],"the minor differences between these modes of beauty, and, for the most"
1311,THE SUBLIME[1],"part, leaving grandeur out of account."
1312,THE SUBLIME[1],
1313,THE SUBLIME[1],We need not ask here what is the exact meaning of that 'greatness' of
1314,THE SUBLIME[1],which I have spoken: but we must observe at once that the greatness in
1315,THE SUBLIME[1],"question is of more than one kind. Let us understand by the term, to"
1316,THE SUBLIME[1],"begin with, greatness of extent,--of size, number, or duration; and let"
1317,THE SUBLIME[1],"us ask whether sublime things are, in this sense, exceedingly great."
1318,THE SUBLIME[1],"Some certainly are. The vault of heaven, one expanse of blue, or dark"
1319,THE SUBLIME[1],and studded with countless and prodigiously distant stars; the sea that
1320,THE SUBLIME[1],"stretches to the horizon and beyond it, a surface smooth as glass or"
1321,THE SUBLIME[1],"breaking into innumerable waves; time, to which we can imagine no"
1322,THE SUBLIME[1],"beginning and no end,--these furnish favourite examples of sublimity;"
1323,THE SUBLIME[1],"and to call them great seems almost mockery, for they are images of"
1324,THE SUBLIME[1],"immeasurable magnitude. When we turn from them to living beings, of"
1325,THE SUBLIME[1],"course our standard of greatness changes;[3] but, using the standard"
1326,THE SUBLIME[1],"appropriate to the sphere, we find again that the sublime things have,"
1327,THE SUBLIME[1],"for the most part, great magnitude. A graceful tree need not be a large"
1328,THE SUBLIME[1],one; a pretty tree is almost always small; but a sublime tree is almost
1329,THE SUBLIME[1],"always large. If you were asked to mention sublime animals, you would"
1330,THE SUBLIME[1],"perhaps suggest, among birds, the eagle; among fishes, if any, the"
1331,THE SUBLIME[1],"whale; among beasts, the lion or the tiger, the python or the elephant."
1332,THE SUBLIME[1],But you would find it hard to name a sublime insect; and indeed it is
1333,THE SUBLIME[1],"not easy, perhaps not possible, to feel sublimity in any animal smaller"
1334,THE SUBLIME[1],"than oneself, unless one goes beyond the special kind of greatness at"
1335,THE SUBLIME[1],present under review. Consider again such facts as these: that a human
1336,THE SUBLIME[1],"being of average, or even of less than average, stature and build may be"
1337,THE SUBLIME[1],"graceful and even 'beautiful,' but can hardly, in respect of stature and"
1338,THE SUBLIME[1],"build, be grand or sublime; that we most commonly think of flowers as"
1339,THE SUBLIME[1],"little things, and also most commonly think of them as 'beautiful,'"
1340,THE SUBLIME[1],"graceful, pretty, but rarely as grand, and still more rarely as"
1341,THE SUBLIME[1],"sublime, and that in these latter cases we do not think of them as"
1342,THE SUBLIME[1],"small; that a mighty river may well be sublime, but hardly a stream; a"
1343,THE SUBLIME[1],"towering or far-stretching mountain, but hardly a low hill; a vast"
1344,THE SUBLIME[1],"bridge, but hardly one of moderate span; a great cathedral, but hardly a"
1345,THE SUBLIME[1],"village church; that a model of a sublime building is not sublime,"
1346,THE SUBLIME[1],unless in imagination you expand it to the dimensions of its original;
1347,THE SUBLIME[1],"that a plain, though flat, may be sublime if its extent is immense; that"
1348,THE SUBLIME[1],"while we constantly say 'a pretty little thing,' or even 'a beautiful"
1349,THE SUBLIME[1],"little thing,' nobody ever says 'a sublime little thing.' Examples like"
1350,THE SUBLIME[1],"these seem to show clearly--not that bigness is sublimity, for bigness"
1351,THE SUBLIME[1],"need have no beauty, while sublimity is a mode of beauty--but that this"
1352,THE SUBLIME[1],"particular mode of beauty is frequently connected with, and dependent"
1353,THE SUBLIME[1],"on, exceeding greatness of extent."
1354,THE SUBLIME[1],
1355,THE SUBLIME[1],Let us now take a further step. Can there be sublimity when such
1356,THE SUBLIME[1],"greatness is absent? And, if there can, is greatness of some other sort"
1357,THE SUBLIME[1],"always present in such cases, and essential to the sublime effect? The"
1358,THE SUBLIME[1],answer to the first of these questions is beyond doubt. Children have no
1359,THE SUBLIME[1],"great extension, and what Wordsworth calls 'a six-years' darling of a"
1360,THE SUBLIME[1],pigmy size' is (if a darling) generally called pretty but not sublime;
1361,THE SUBLIME[1],"for it _is_ 'of a pigmy size.' Yet it certainly _may_ be sublime, and it"
1362,THE SUBLIME[1],is so to the poet who addresses it thus:
1363,THE SUBLIME[1],
1364,THE SUBLIME[1],Thou whose exterior semblance doth belie
1365,THE SUBLIME[1],Thy soul's immensity....
1366,THE SUBLIME[1],Mighty prophet! Seer blest!
1367,THE SUBLIME[1],On whom those truths do rest
1368,THE SUBLIME[1],Which we are toiling all our lives to find.
1369,THE SUBLIME[1],
1370,THE SUBLIME[1],"A baby is still smaller, but a baby too may be sublime. The starry sky"
1371,THE SUBLIME[1],is not more sublime than the babe on the arm of the Madonna di San
1372,THE SUBLIME[1],Sisto. A sparrow is more diminutive still; but that it is possible for a
1373,THE SUBLIME[1],sparrow to be sublime is not difficult to show. This is a translation
1374,THE SUBLIME[1],of a prose poem by Tourgénieff:
1375,THE SUBLIME[1],
1376,THE SUBLIME[1],"I was on my way home from hunting, and was walking up the garden"
1377,THE SUBLIME[1],avenue. My dog was running on in front of me.
1378,THE SUBLIME[1],
1379,THE SUBLIME[1],"Suddenly he slackened his pace, and began to steal forward as though"
1380,THE SUBLIME[1],he scented game ahead.
1381,THE SUBLIME[1],
1382,THE SUBLIME[1],"I looked along the avenue; and I saw on the ground a young sparrow,"
1383,THE SUBLIME[1],"its beak edged with yellow, and its head covered with soft down. It"
1384,THE SUBLIME[1],"had fallen from the nest (a strong wind was blowing, and shaking the"
1385,THE SUBLIME[1],"birches of the avenue); and there it sat and never stirred, except to"
1386,THE SUBLIME[1],stretch out its little half-grown wings in a helpless flutter.
1387,THE SUBLIME[1],
1388,THE SUBLIME[1],"My dog was slowly approaching it, when suddenly, darting from the tree"
1389,THE SUBLIME[1],"overhead, an old black-throated sparrow dropt like a stone right"
1390,THE SUBLIME[1],"before his nose, and, all rumpled and flustered, with a plaintive"
1391,THE SUBLIME[1],"desperate cry flung itself, once, twice, at his open jaws with their"
1392,THE SUBLIME[1],great teeth.
1393,THE SUBLIME[1],
1394,THE SUBLIME[1],It would save its young one; it screened it with its own body; the
1395,THE SUBLIME[1],tiny frame quivered with terror; the little cries grew wild and
1396,THE SUBLIME[1],hoarse; it sank and died. It had sacrificed itself.
1397,THE SUBLIME[1],
1398,THE SUBLIME[1],What a huge monster the dog must have seemed to it! And yet it could
1399,THE SUBLIME[1],not stay up there on its safe bough. A power stronger than its own
1400,THE SUBLIME[1],will tore it away.
1401,THE SUBLIME[1],
1402,THE SUBLIME[1],"My dog stood still, and then slunk back disconcerted. Plainly he too"
1403,THE SUBLIME[1],had to recognise that power. I called him to me; and a feeling of
1404,THE SUBLIME[1],reverence came over me as I passed on.
1405,THE SUBLIME[1],
1406,THE SUBLIME[1],"Yes, do not laugh. It was really reverence I felt before that little"
1407,THE SUBLIME[1],heroic bird and the passionate outburst of its love.
1408,THE SUBLIME[1],
1409,THE SUBLIME[1],"Love, I thought, is verily stronger than death and the terror of"
1410,THE SUBLIME[1],"death. By love, only by love, is life sustained and moved."
1411,THE SUBLIME[1],
1412,THE SUBLIME[1],"This sparrow, it will be agreed, is sublime. What, then, makes it so?"
1413,THE SUBLIME[1],"Not largeness of size, assuredly, but, we answer, its love and courage."
1414,THE SUBLIME[1],Yes; but what do we mean by '_its_ love and courage'? We often meet with
1415,THE SUBLIME[1],"love and courage, and always admire and approve them; but we do not"
1416,THE SUBLIME[1],"always find them sublime. Why, then, are they sublime in the sparrow?"
1417,THE SUBLIME[1],"From their extraordinary greatness. It is not in the quality alone, but"
1418,THE SUBLIME[1],"in the quantity of the quality, that the sublimity lies. And this may be"
1419,THE SUBLIME[1],"readily seen if we imagine the quantity to be considerably reduced,--if"
1420,THE SUBLIME[1],"we imagine the parent bird, after its first brave effort, flinching and"
1421,THE SUBLIME[1],"flying away, or if we suppose the bird that sacrifices itself to be no"
1422,THE SUBLIME[1],"sparrow but a turkey. In either case love and courage would remain, but"
1423,THE SUBLIME[1],"sublimity would recede or vanish, simply because the love and courage"
1424,THE SUBLIME[1],would no longer possess the required immensity.[4]
1425,THE SUBLIME[1],
1426,THE SUBLIME[1],"The sublimity of the sparrow, then, no less than that of the sky or sea,"
1427,THE SUBLIME[1],"depends on exceeding or overwhelming greatness--a greatness, however,"
1428,THE SUBLIME[1],"not of extension but rather of strength or power, and in this case of"
1429,THE SUBLIME[1],"spiritual power. 'Love is _stronger_ than death,' quotes the poet; 'a"
1430,THE SUBLIME[1],power _stronger_ than its own tore it away.' So it is with the dog of
1431,THE SUBLIME[1],"whom Scott and Wordsworth sang, whose master had perished among the"
1432,THE SUBLIME[1],"crags of Helvellyn, and who was found three months after by his master's"
1433,THE SUBLIME[1],"body,"
1434,THE SUBLIME[1],
1435,THE SUBLIME[1],How nourished here through such long time
1436,THE SUBLIME[1],"He knows who gave that love sublime,"
1437,THE SUBLIME[1],"And gave that strength of feeling, great"
1438,THE SUBLIME[1],Above all human estimate.[5]
1439,THE SUBLIME[1],
1440,THE SUBLIME[1],"And if we look further we shall find that these cases of sublimity are,"
1441,THE SUBLIME[1],"in this respect, far from being exceptions: 'thy soul's _immensity_,'"
1442,THE SUBLIME[1],says Wordsworth to the child; '_mighty_ prophet' he calls it. We shall
1443,THE SUBLIME[1],"find, in fact, that in the sublime, when there is not greatness of"
1444,THE SUBLIME[1],"extent, there is another greatness, which (without saying that the"
1445,THE SUBLIME[1],phrase is invariably the most appropriate) we may call greatness of
1446,THE SUBLIME[1],power and which in these cases is essential.
1447,THE SUBLIME[1],
1448,THE SUBLIME[1],"We must develop this statement a little. Naturally the power, and"
1449,THE SUBLIME[1],"therefore the sublimity, will differ in its character in different"
1450,THE SUBLIME[1],"instances, and therefore will affect us variously. It may be--to"
1451,THE SUBLIME[1],"classify very roughly--physical, or vital, or (in the old wide sense of"
1452,THE SUBLIME[1],"the word) moral, like that of the sparrow and the dog. And physical"
1453,THE SUBLIME[1],"force will appeal to the imagination in one way, and vital in another,"
1454,THE SUBLIME[1],and moral or spiritual in another. But it is still power of some kind
1455,THE SUBLIME[1],"that makes a thing sublime rather than graceful, and immensity of power"
1456,THE SUBLIME[1],"that makes it sublime rather than merely grand. For example, the lines"
1457,THE SUBLIME[1],"of the water in a thin cascade may be exquisitely graceful, but such a"
1458,THE SUBLIME[1],cascade has not power enough to be sublime. Flickering fire in a grate
1459,THE SUBLIME[1],"is often 'beautiful,' but it is not sublime; the fire of a big bonfire"
1460,THE SUBLIME[1],"is on the way to be so; a 'great fire' frequently is so, because it"
1461,THE SUBLIME[1],"gives the impression of tremendous power. The ocean, in those stanzas of"
1462,THE SUBLIME[1],_Childe Harold_ which no amount of familiarity or of defect can deprive
1463,THE SUBLIME[1],"of their sublimity, is the untameable monster which engulfs men as"
1464,THE SUBLIME[1],lightly as rain-drops and shatters fleets like toys. The sublimity of
1465,THE SUBLIME[1],Behemoth and Leviathan in the _Book of Job_ lies in the contrast of
1466,THE SUBLIME[1],their enormous might with the puny power of man; that of the horse in
1467,THE SUBLIME[1],the fiery energy of his courage and strength. Think of sublime figures
1468,THE SUBLIME[1],"or ideas in the world of fiction or of history, and you find that,"
1469,THE SUBLIME[1],"whether they are radiant or gloomy, violent or peaceful, terrible or"
1470,THE SUBLIME[1],"adorable, they all impress the imagination by their immense or even"
1471,THE SUBLIME[1],"irresistible might. It is so with Achilles, standing alone beyond the"
1472,THE SUBLIME[1],"wall, with the light of the divine flame soaring from his head, while he"
1473,THE SUBLIME[1],sends across the trench that shout at whose far-off sound the hearts of
1474,THE SUBLIME[1],"the Trojans die within them; or with Odysseus, when the moment of his"
1475,THE SUBLIME[1],"vengeance has come, and he casts off his rags, and leaps onto the"
1476,THE SUBLIME[1],"threshold with his bow, and pours his arrows down at his feet, and looks"
1477,THE SUBLIME[1],down the long hall at the doomed faces of his feasting enemies. Milton's
1478,THE SUBLIME[1],Satan is sublime when he refuses to accept defeat from an omnipotent
1479,THE SUBLIME[1],"foe; he ceases to be so in tempting Eve, because here he shows not power"
1480,THE SUBLIME[1],"but cunning, and we feel not the strength of his cunning but the"
1481,THE SUBLIME[1],"weakness of his victim. In the bust of Zeus in the Vatican, in some of"
1482,THE SUBLIME[1],"the figures of the Medici Chapel, in 'The horse and his rider,' we feel"
1483,THE SUBLIME[1],"again sublimity, because we feel gigantic power, put forth or held in"
1484,THE SUBLIME[1],"reserve. Fate or Death, imagined as a lurking assassin, is not sublime,"
1485,THE SUBLIME[1],"but may become so when imagined as inevitable, irresistible,"
1486,THE SUBLIME[1],"_ineluctabile fatum_. The eternal laws to which Antigone appeals, like"
1487,THE SUBLIME[1],that Duty which preserves the strength and freshness of the most ancient
1488,THE SUBLIME[1],"heavens, are sublime. Prometheus, the saviour of mankind, opposing a"
1489,THE SUBLIME[1],boundless power of enduring pain to a boundless power of inflicting it;
1490,THE SUBLIME[1],"Regulus returning unmoved to his doom; Socrates, serene and even joyous"
1491,THE SUBLIME[1],"in the presence of injury and death and the lamentations of his friends,"
1492,THE SUBLIME[1],are sublime. The words 'I have overcome the world' are among the most
1493,THE SUBLIME[1],"sublime on record, and they are also the expression of the absolute"
1494,THE SUBLIME[1],power of the spirit.[6]
1495,THE SUBLIME[1],
1496,THE SUBLIME[1],"It seems clear, then, that sublimity very often arises from an"
1497,THE SUBLIME[1],"overwhelming greatness of power. So abundant, indeed, are the instances"
1498,THE SUBLIME[1],that one begins to wonder whether it ever arises from any other kind of
1499,THE SUBLIME[1],"greatness, and whether we were right in supposing that mere magnitude of"
1500,THE SUBLIME[1],"extension can produce it. Would such magnitude, however prodigious, seem"
1501,THE SUBLIME[1],to us sublime unless we insensibly construed it as the sign of power? In
1502,THE SUBLIME[1],"the case of living things, at any rate, this doubt seems to be well"
1503,THE SUBLIME[1],founded. A tree is sublime not because it occupies a large extent of
1504,THE SUBLIME[1],"empty space or time, but from the power in it which raises aloft and"
1505,THE SUBLIME[1],"spreads abroad a thousand branches and a million leaves, or which has"
1506,THE SUBLIME[1],battled for centuries with buffeting storms and has seen summers and
1507,THE SUBLIME[1],winters arise and pass like the hours of our day. It is not the mere
1508,THE SUBLIME[1],bulk of the lion or the eagle that wins them their title as king of
1509,THE SUBLIME[1],"beasts or of birds, but the power exhibited in the gigantic head and arm"
1510,THE SUBLIME[1],or the stretch of wing and the piercing eye. And even when we pass from
1511,THE SUBLIME[1],"the realm of life our doubt remains. Would a mountain, a river, or a"
1512,THE SUBLIME[1],building be sublime to us if we did not read their masses and lines as
1513,THE SUBLIME[1],"symbols of force? Would even the illimitable extent of sea or sky, the"
1514,THE SUBLIME[1],"endlessness of time, or the countlessness of stars or sands or waves,"
1515,THE SUBLIME[1],bring us anything but fatigue or depression if we did not apprehend
1516,THE SUBLIME[1],"them, in some way and however vaguely, as expressions of immeasurable"
1517,THE SUBLIME[1],"power--power that created them, or lives in them, or _can_ count them;"
1518,THE SUBLIME[1],"so that what impresses us is not the mere absence of limits, but the"
1519,THE SUBLIME[1],presence of something that overpowers any imaginable limit? If these
1520,THE SUBLIME[1],"doubts are justified (as in my opinion they are), the conclusion will"
1521,THE SUBLIME[1],follow that the exceeding greatness required for sublimity is _always_
1522,THE SUBLIME[1],"greatness of some kind of power, though in one class of cases the"
1523,THE SUBLIME[1],impression of this greatness can only be conveyed through immensity of
1524,THE SUBLIME[1],extent.
1525,THE SUBLIME[1],
1526,THE SUBLIME[1],"However this question may be decided, our result so far seems to be that"
1527,THE SUBLIME[1],the peculiarity of the sublime lies in some exceeding and overwhelming
1528,THE SUBLIME[1],"greatness. But before this result can be considered safe, two obstacles"
1529,THE SUBLIME[1],"must be removed. In the first place, are there no negative instances? Is"
1530,THE SUBLIME[1],it impossible to find anything sublime which does _not_ show this
1531,THE SUBLIME[1],greatness? Naturally I can say no more than that I have conscientiously
1532,THE SUBLIME[1],searched for exceptions to the rule and have searched in vain. I can
1533,THE SUBLIME[1],find only apparent exceptions which in reality confirm the rule; and I
1534,THE SUBLIME[1],will mention only those which look the most formidable. They are cases
1535,THE SUBLIME[1],where at first sight there seems to be not merely an inconsiderable
1536,THE SUBLIME[1],"amount of power or other greatness, but actually the negation of it. For"
1537,THE SUBLIME[1],"example, the silence of night, or the sudden pause in a storm or in"
1538,THE SUBLIME[1],"stormy music, or again the silence and movelessness of death, may"
1539,THE SUBLIME[1],"undoubtedly be sublime; and how, it may be asked, can a mere absence of"
1540,THE SUBLIME[1],"sound and motion be an exhibition of immense greatness? It cannot, I"
1541,THE SUBLIME[1],answer; but neither can it be sublime. If you apprehend the silence in
1542,THE SUBLIME[1],"these cases as a mere absence, no feeling of sublimity will arise in"
1543,THE SUBLIME[1],"your mind; and if you do apprehend the silence as sublime, it is to you"
1544,THE SUBLIME[1],"the sign of immense power, put forth or held in reserve. The 'dead pause"
1545,THE SUBLIME[1],abrupt of mighty winds' is the pause _of_ mighty winds and not of gentle
1546,THE SUBLIME[1],"breezes; and it is not the absence of mighty winds, but their _pause_"
1547,THE SUBLIME[1],before they burst into renewed fury; or if their silence is not their
1548,THE SUBLIME[1],"will, it is a silence imposed on them by something mightier even than"
1549,THE SUBLIME[1],"they. In either case there may be sublimity, but then there is the"
1550,THE SUBLIME[1],"impression of immense power. In the same way the silence of night, when"
1551,THE SUBLIME[1],"it seems sublime, is apprehended not as the absence but as the subdual"
1552,THE SUBLIME[1],"of sound,--the stillness wrought by a power so mighty that at its touch"
1553,THE SUBLIME[1],"all the restless noises of the day fall dumb,--or the brooding of an"
1554,THE SUBLIME[1],"omnipotent peace over the world. And such a peace it is, an unassailable"
1555,THE SUBLIME[1],"peace, that may make the face of death sublime, a stillness which is not"
1556,THE SUBLIME[1],moveless but immovable.[7]
1557,THE SUBLIME[1],
1558,THE SUBLIME[1],"At present, then, our result seems to stand firm. But another danger"
1559,THE SUBLIME[1],remains. Granted that in the sublime there is always some exceeding and
1560,THE SUBLIME[1],"overwhelming greatness, is that _all_ there is? Is there not in every"
1561,THE SUBLIME[1],"case some further characteristic? This question, premising that the"
1562,THE SUBLIME[1],phrase 'overwhelming greatness' contains important implications which
1563,THE SUBLIME[1],"have yet to be considered, I can only answer like the last. I do not"
1564,THE SUBLIME[1],find any other peculiarity that is _always_ present. Several have been
1565,THE SUBLIME[1],"alleged, and one or two of these will be mentioned later, but none of"
1566,THE SUBLIME[1],them appears to show itself indubitably wherever sublimity is found. It
1567,THE SUBLIME[1],is easy to give a much fuller account of the sublime if you include in
1568,THE SUBLIME[1],it everything that impresses you in a sublime baby while you omit to
1569,THE SUBLIME[1],"consider Behemoth, or if you build upon Socrates and ignore Satan, or if"
1570,THE SUBLIME[1],you confine yourself to the sublime thunderstorm and forget the sublime
1571,THE SUBLIME[1],rainbow or sunrise. But then your account will not answer to the
1572,THE SUBLIME[1],instances you have ignored; and when you take them in you will have to
1573,THE SUBLIME[1],pare it down until perhaps you end in a result like ours. At any rate we
1574,THE SUBLIME[1],"had better be content with it for the present, and turn to another"
1575,THE SUBLIME[1],aspect of the matter.[8]
1576,THE SUBLIME[1],
1577,THE SUBLIME[1],"So far, on the whole, we have been regarding the sublime object as if"
1578,THE SUBLIME[1],its sublimity were independent of our state of mind in feeling and
1579,THE SUBLIME[1],apprehending it. Yet the adjective in the phrase 'overwhelming
1580,THE SUBLIME[1],greatness' should at once suggest the truth that this state of mind is
1581,THE SUBLIME[1],"essential to sublimity. Let us now therefore look inward, and ask how"
1582,THE SUBLIME[1],this state differs from our state in perceiving or imagining what is
1583,THE SUBLIME[1],"graceful or 'beautiful.' Since Kant dealt with the subject, most writers"
1584,THE SUBLIME[1],who have thought about it have agreed that there is a decided
1585,THE SUBLIME[1],"difference, which I will try to describe broadly, and without pledging"
1586,THE SUBLIME[1],myself to the entire accuracy of the description.
1587,THE SUBLIME[1],
1588,THE SUBLIME[1],"When, on seeing or hearing something, we exclaim, How graceful! or How"
1589,THE SUBLIME[1],lovely! or How 'beautiful'! there is in us an immediate outflow of
1590,THE SUBLIME[1],"pleasure, an unchecked expansion, a delightful sense of harmony between"
1591,THE SUBLIME[1],the thing and ourselves.
1592,THE SUBLIME[1],
1593,THE SUBLIME[1],The air
1594,THE SUBLIME[1],Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
1595,THE SUBLIME[1],Unto our gentle senses.... The heaven's breath
1596,THE SUBLIME[1],Smells wooingly here.
1597,THE SUBLIME[1],
1598,THE SUBLIME[1],The thing wins us and draws us towards itself without resistance.
1599,THE SUBLIME[1],"Something in us hastens to meet it in sympathy or love. Our feeling, we"
1600,THE SUBLIME[1],"may say, is entirely affirmative. For though it is not always untouched"
1601,THE SUBLIME[1],"by pain (for the thing may have sadness in it),[9] this touch of pain or"
1602,THE SUBLIME[1],"sadness does not mean any disharmony between the thing and us, or"
1603,THE SUBLIME[1],involve any check in our acceptance of it.
1604,THE SUBLIME[1],
1605,THE SUBLIME[1],"In the case of sublimity, on the other hand, this acceptance does not"
1606,THE SUBLIME[1],"seem to be so simple or immediate. There seem, in fact, to be two"
1607,THE SUBLIME[1],'aspects' or stages in it.[10] First--if only for a fraction of a
1608,THE SUBLIME[1],"second--there is a sense of being checked, or baffled, or even"
1609,THE SUBLIME[1],"stupefied, or possibly even repelled or menaced, as though something"
1610,THE SUBLIME[1],"were affecting us which we could not receive, or grasp, or stand up to."
1611,THE SUBLIME[1],"In certain cases we appear to shrink away from it, as though it thrust"
1612,THE SUBLIME[1],upon us a sense of our own feebleness or insignificance. This we may
1613,THE SUBLIME[1],call by the convenient but too strong name of the negative stage. It is
1614,THE SUBLIME[1],essential to sublimity; and nothing seems to correspond to it in our
1615,THE SUBLIME[1],perception of loveliness or grace except sometimes a sense of surprise
1616,THE SUBLIME[1],"or wonder, which is wholly pleasant, and which does not necessarily"
1617,THE SUBLIME[1],qualify the lovely or graceful thing.
1618,THE SUBLIME[1],
1619,THE SUBLIME[1],But this first stage or aspect clearly does not by itself suffice for
1620,THE SUBLIME[1],"sublimity. To it there succeeds, it may be instantaneously or more"
1621,THE SUBLIME[1],"gradually, another: a powerful reaction, a rush of self-expansion, or an"
1622,THE SUBLIME[1],"uplifting, or a sense of being borne out of the self that was checked,"
1623,THE SUBLIME[1],or even of being carried away beyond all checks and limits. These
1624,THE SUBLIME[1],"feelings, even when the sublime thing might be called forbidding,"
1625,THE SUBLIME[1],"menacing, or terrible, are always positive,--feelings of union with it;"
1626,THE SUBLIME[1],"and, when its nature permits of this, they may amount to rapture or"
1627,THE SUBLIME[1],"adoration. But the mark of the negation from which they have issued, the"
1628,THE SUBLIME[1],"'smell of the fire,' usually remains on them. The union, we may say"
1629,THE SUBLIME[1],"perhaps, has required a self-surrender, and the rapture or adoration is"
1630,THE SUBLIME[1],often strongly tinged with awe.
1631,THE SUBLIME[1],
1632,THE SUBLIME[1],"Now, this peculiar doubleness in our apprehension of sublimity, this"
1633,THE SUBLIME[1],"presence of two equally necessary stages or phases, a negative and a"
1634,THE SUBLIME[1],"positive, seems to correspond with the peculiarity which we found in the"
1635,THE SUBLIME[1],sublime object when we were provisionally regarding it by itself. It is
1636,THE SUBLIME[1],"its overwhelming greatness which for a moment checks, baffles, subdues,"
1637,THE SUBLIME[1],"even repels us or makes us feel our littleness, and which then, forcing"
1638,THE SUBLIME[1],"its way into the imagination and emotions, distends or uplifts them to"
1639,THE SUBLIME[1],"its own dimensions. We burst our own limits, go out to the sublime thing,"
1640,THE SUBLIME[1],"identify ourselves ideally with it, and share its immense greatness. But"
1641,THE SUBLIME[1],"if, and in so far as, we remain conscious of our difference from it, we"
1642,THE SUBLIME[1],"still feel the insignificance of our actual selves, and our glory is"
1643,THE SUBLIME[1],mingled with awe or even with self-abasement.[11]
1644,THE SUBLIME[1],
1645,THE SUBLIME[1],In writing thus I was endeavouring simply and without any _arrière
1646,THE SUBLIME[1],pensée_ to describe a mode of aesthetic experience. But it must have
1647,THE SUBLIME[1],occurred to some of my hearers that the description recalls other kinds
1648,THE SUBLIME[1],"of experience. And if they find it accurate in the main, they will"
1649,THE SUBLIME[1],"appreciate, even if they do not accept, the exalted claim which"
1650,THE SUBLIME[1],"philosophers, in various forms, have made for the sublime. It awakes in"
1651,THE SUBLIME[1],"us, they say, through the check or shock which it gives to our finitude,"
1652,THE SUBLIME[1],the consciousness of an infinite or absolute; and this is the reason of
1653,THE SUBLIME[1],the kinship we feel between this particular mode of aesthetic experience
1654,THE SUBLIME[1],"on the one side, and, on the other, morality or religion. For there, by"
1655,THE SUBLIME[1],"the denial of our merely finite or individual selves, we rise into union"
1656,THE SUBLIME[1],"with the law which imposes on us an unconditional demand, or with the"
1657,THE SUBLIME[1],infinite source and end of our spiritual life.
1658,THE SUBLIME[1],
1659,THE SUBLIME[1],"These are ideas much too large to be considered now, and even later I"
1660,THE SUBLIME[1],can but touch on them. But the mere mention of them may carry us to the
1661,THE SUBLIME[1],last enquiries with which we can deal. For it suggests this question:
1662,THE SUBLIME[1],"Supposing that high claim to be justified at all, can it really be made"
1663,THE SUBLIME[1],"for _all_ sublimity, or must it not be confined to the very highest"
1664,THE SUBLIME[1],forms? A similar question must be raised as to various other statements
1665,THE SUBLIME[1],regarding the sublime; and I go on to speak of some of these.
1666,THE SUBLIME[1],
1667,THE SUBLIME[1],(1) Burke asserted that the sublime is always founded on fear; indeed he
1668,THE SUBLIME[1],"considered this to be its distinguishing characteristic. Setting aside,"
1669,THE SUBLIME[1],"then, the connection of this statement with Burke's general doctrine (a"
1670,THE SUBLIME[1],"doctrine impossible to accept), we may ask, Is it true that the 'check'"
1671,THE SUBLIME[1],administered by the sublime object is always one of fear? We must
1672,THE SUBLIME[1],"answer, first, that if this check is part of an aesthetic experience and"
1673,THE SUBLIME[1],"not a mere preliminary to it, it can _never_ be fear in the common"
1674,THE SUBLIME[1],"meaning of that word, or what may be called practical or real fear. So"
1675,THE SUBLIME[1],"far as we are _practically_ afraid of a storm or a mountain, afraid, for"
1676,THE SUBLIME[1],"instance, for ourselves as bodily beings in this particular spatial and"
1677,THE SUBLIME[1],"temporal position, the storm or mountain is not sublime to us, it is"
1678,THE SUBLIME[1],"simply terrible. _That_ fear must be absent, or must not engage"
1679,THE SUBLIME[1],"attention, or must be changed in character, if the object is to be for"
1680,THE SUBLIME[1],"us _sublimely_ terrible, something with which we identify ourselves in"
1681,THE SUBLIME[1],"imaginative sympathy, and which so causes a great self-expansion. But,"
1682,THE SUBLIME[1],"secondly, even if 'fear' is understood rightly as indicating a feature"
1683,THE SUBLIME[1],"in an aesthetic and not a practical experience, our question must"
1684,THE SUBLIME[1],obviously be answered in the negative. There is fear in the apprehension
1685,THE SUBLIME[1],"of some sublimity, but by no means in that of all. If there is a"
1686,THE SUBLIME[1],"momentary check, for example, in the case of a rainbow, a glorious"
1687,THE SUBLIME[1],"sunrise, the starry night, Socrates, or Tourgénieff's sparrow, 'fear,'"
1688,THE SUBLIME[1],"unless the meaning of the word is unnaturally extended, is surely not"
1689,THE SUBLIME[1],the name for this check.
1690,THE SUBLIME[1],
1691,THE SUBLIME[1],"Burke's mistake, however, implies a recognition of the 'negative aspect'"
1692,THE SUBLIME[1],"in sublimity, and it may remind us of a truth. Instances of the sublime"
1693,THE SUBLIME[1],differ greatly in regard to the prominence and tone of this aspect. It
1694,THE SUBLIME[1],"is less marked, for example, and less obvious, in the case of a sublime"
1695,THE SUBLIME[1],rainbow or sunrise than in that of a sublime and 'terrible'
1696,THE SUBLIME[1],thunderstorm. And in general we may say that the _distinctive_ nature of
1697,THE SUBLIME[1],"sublimity appears most clearly where this aspect is most prominent,--so"
1698,THE SUBLIME[1],"prominent, perhaps, that we have a more or less explicit sense of the"
1699,THE SUBLIME[1],"littleness and powerlessness of ourselves, and indeed of the whole"
1700,THE SUBLIME[1],world of our usual experience. It is here that the object is most
1701,THE SUBLIME[1],"decidedly more than 'glorious,' or even 'majestic,' and that sublimity"
1702,THE SUBLIME[1],appears in antithesis to grace. Only we must not give an account of the
1703,THE SUBLIME[1],"sublime which fully applies to these cases _alone_, or suppose that the"
1704,THE SUBLIME[1],negative aspect is absent in other cases. If a rainbow or sunrise is
1705,THE SUBLIME[1],"really sublime, it is overwhelming as well as uplifting. Nor must we"
1706,THE SUBLIME[1],assume that the most distinctively sublime must also be the most
1707,THE SUBLIME[1],sublime. The sunrise witnessed from an immense snowfield in the high
1708,THE SUBLIME[1],"Alps may be as sublime as an Alpine thunderstorm, though its sublimity"
1709,THE SUBLIME[1],is different.
1710,THE SUBLIME[1],
1711,THE SUBLIME[1],"(2) Grace and 'beauty,' it has been said, though not of course merely"
1712,THE SUBLIME[1],"sensuous, are yet friendly to sense. It is their essence, in fact, to be"
1713,THE SUBLIME[1],"a harmonious unity of sense and spirit, and so to reconcile powers which"
1714,THE SUBLIME[1],in much of our experience are conflicting and dissonant. But sublimity
1715,THE SUBLIME[1],is harsh and hostile to sense. It makes us feel in ourselves and in the
1716,THE SUBLIME[1],world the presence of something irresistibly superior to sense. And this
1717,THE SUBLIME[1],"is the reason why it does not soothe or delight, but uplifts us."
1718,THE SUBLIME[1],
1719,THE SUBLIME[1],"This statement recalls some of the ideas we have been considering, but"
1720,THE SUBLIME[1],"it may easily mislead. For one thing, it is impossible for any sublimity"
1721,THE SUBLIME[1],"whatever to be _merely_ hostile to 'sense,' since everything aesthetic"
1722,THE SUBLIME[1],"must appeal to sense or sensuous imagination, so that the sublime must"
1723,THE SUBLIME[1],at least express its hostility to sense by means of sense. And if we
1724,THE SUBLIME[1],"take the phrase in another meaning, the statement may mislead still, for"
1725,THE SUBLIME[1],it attributes to sublimity in general what is a characteristic only of
1726,THE SUBLIME[1],certain forms of the sublime. Scores of examples could easily be quoted
1727,THE SUBLIME[1],"which show no hostility to sense: _e.g._ a sublime lion, or bull, or"
1728,THE SUBLIME[1],tree. And if we think of our old examples of the rainbow and the
1729,THE SUBLIME[1],"sunrise, or, better still, of a thunderstorm, or 'The horse and his"
1730,THE SUBLIME[1],"rider,' or the 'Sanctus' in Bach's Mass, we find the sublime thing"
1731,THE SUBLIME[1],actually making a powerful appeal to sense and depending for its
1732,THE SUBLIME[1],sublimity on the vehemence or volume of this appeal. Diminish at all
1733,THE SUBLIME[1],"markedly in these cases the amount of light, colour, or sound, and the"
1734,THE SUBLIME[1],sublimity would vanish. Of course the appeal here is not merely to
1735,THE SUBLIME[1],"sense, but it _is_ to sense."
1736,THE SUBLIME[1],
1737,THE SUBLIME[1],But undoubtedly there is another kind of sublimity; and it is
1738,THE SUBLIME[1],"particularly interesting. Here, it is true, a sort of despite is done to"
1739,THE SUBLIME[1],"the senses and what speaks to them. As we have seen, the greatness of"
1740,THE SUBLIME[1],soul in the sparrow is enhanced by contrast with the smallness and
1741,THE SUBLIME[1],"feebleness of its body, and pours contempt on the visible magnitude of"
1742,THE SUBLIME[1],the hound; and the stillness of night or death is sublime from its
1743,THE SUBLIME[1],"active negation of sound and motion. Again, there is a famous passage"
1744,THE SUBLIME[1],"which depends for its effect on this, that, first, sublime things are"
1745,THE SUBLIME[1],"introduced which appeal powerfully to sense, and then something else,"
1746,THE SUBLIME[1],"which does not so appeal, is made to appear even more sublime and to put"
1747,THE SUBLIME[1],"them to shame: first a great and strong wind, an earthquake, a fire; and"
1748,THE SUBLIME[1],"after the fire a still small voice. Sometimes, again, as Burke observed,"
1749,THE SUBLIME[1],"sublimity depends on, or is increased by, darkness, obscurity,"
1750,THE SUBLIME[1],"vagueness,--refusal of satisfaction to the sense of sight. Often in"
1751,THE SUBLIME[1],"these cases the sublime object is terrible, and its terror is increased"
1752,THE SUBLIME[1],by inability to see or distinguish it. Examples are the image of 'the
1753,THE SUBLIME[1],"pestilence that walketh in darkness,' or Milton's description of Death,"
1754,THE SUBLIME[1],or the lines in the _Book of Job_:
1755,THE SUBLIME[1],
1756,THE SUBLIME[1],In thoughts from the visions of the night
1757,THE SUBLIME[1],"When deep sleep falleth on men,"
1758,THE SUBLIME[1],"Fear came upon me and trembling,"
1759,THE SUBLIME[1],Which made all my bones to shake.
1760,THE SUBLIME[1],Then a spirit passed before my face;
1761,THE SUBLIME[1],The hair of my flesh stood up.
1762,THE SUBLIME[1],"It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof."
1763,THE SUBLIME[1],An image was before mine eyes.
1764,THE SUBLIME[1],"There was silence, and I heard a voice."
1765,THE SUBLIME[1],
1766,THE SUBLIME[1],It has been observed that attempts to illustrate such passages as these
1767,THE SUBLIME[1],dissipate their sublimity by diminishing the obscurity of the object.
1768,THE SUBLIME[1],"Blake's illustrations of the lines in Milton and in _Job_[12] show this,"
1769,THE SUBLIME[1],while his design of the morning-stars singing together is worthy even of
1770,THE SUBLIME[1],the words.
1771,THE SUBLIME[1],
1772,THE SUBLIME[1],"We may trace this severity towards sense, again, in examples already"
1773,THE SUBLIME[1],"mentioned, the ideas of Fate, of the eternal laws to which Antigone"
1774,THE SUBLIME[1],"appeals, of Duty in Wordsworth's ode. We imagine these powers as removed"
1775,THE SUBLIME[1],"from sight, and indeed wholly immaterial, and yet as exercising"
1776,THE SUBLIME[1],sovereign dominion over the visible and material world. And their
1777,THE SUBLIME[1],sublimity would be endangered if we tried to bring them nearer to sense
1778,THE SUBLIME[1],by picturing the means by which they exercise their control.
1779,THE SUBLIME[1],
1780,THE SUBLIME[1],I will take a last example. It has probably been mentioned in almost
1781,THE SUBLIME[1],every account of the sublime since Longinus quoted it in his work on
1782,THE SUBLIME[1],Elevation of Style. And it is of special interest here because it
1783,THE SUBLIME[1],illustrates at one and the same time the two kinds of sublimity which we
1784,THE SUBLIME[1],"are engaged in distinguishing. 'God said, Let there be light, and there"
1785,THE SUBLIME[1],"was light.' The idea of the first and instantaneous appearance of light,"
1786,THE SUBLIME[1],"and that the whole light of the whole world, is already sublime; and its"
1787,THE SUBLIME[1],primary appeal is to sense. The further idea that this transcendently
1788,THE SUBLIME[1],"glorious apparition is due to mere words, to a breath--our symbol of"
1789,THE SUBLIME[1],"tenuity, evanescence, impotence to influence material bulk--heightens"
1790,THE SUBLIME[1],enormously the impression of absolutely immeasurable power.
1791,THE SUBLIME[1],
1792,THE SUBLIME[1],"To sum up, then, on this matter. It is not safe to distinguish the"
1793,THE SUBLIME[1],sublime from the 'beautiful' by its hostility to sense. The sublime may
1794,THE SUBLIME[1],"impress its overwhelming greatness in either of two ways, by an appeal"
1795,THE SUBLIME[1],"to sense, or by a kind of despite done to it. Nor can we assert, if we"
1796,THE SUBLIME[1],"think of the sunrise, the thunderstorm, or of sublime music, that the"
1797,THE SUBLIME[1],second of these ways is more distinctive of the sublime than the first.
1798,THE SUBLIME[1],But perhaps we may say this. In 'beauty' that which appears in a
1799,THE SUBLIME[1],"sensuous form seems to rest in it, to be perfectly embodied in it, and"
1800,THE SUBLIME[1],"to have no tendency to pass beyond it. In the sublime, even where no"
1801,THE SUBLIME[1],"such tendency is felt and sublimity is nearest to 'beauty,' we still"
1802,THE SUBLIME[1],"feel the presence of a power held in reserve, which could with ease"
1803,THE SUBLIME[1],"exceed its present expression. In _some_ forms of sublimity, again, the"
1804,THE SUBLIME[1],sensuous embodiment seems threatening to break in its effort to express
1805,THE SUBLIME[1],what appears in it. And in others we definitely feel that the power
1806,THE SUBLIME[1],which for a moment intimates its presence to sense is infinite and
1807,THE SUBLIME[1],utterly uncontainable by any or all vehicles of its manifestation. Here
1808,THE SUBLIME[1],"we are furthest (in a way) from sense, and furthest also from 'beauty.'"
1809,THE SUBLIME[1],
1810,THE SUBLIME[1],"(3) I come finally and, as it will at first seem, needlessly to an idea"
1811,THE SUBLIME[1],"which has already been touched on. The words 'boundless,' 'illimitable,'"
1812,THE SUBLIME[1],"'infinite,' constantly recur in discussions of sublimity, and it cannot"
1813,THE SUBLIME[1],be denied that our experience constantly provokes them. The sublime has
1814,THE SUBLIME[1],been said to awake in us the consciousness of our own infinity. It has
1815,THE SUBLIME[1],"been said, again, to represent in all cases the inadequacy of all finite"
1816,THE SUBLIME[1],"forms to express the infinite. And so we may be told that, even if we do"
1817,THE SUBLIME[1],"not adopt some such formula, but continue to speak of 'greatness,' we"
1818,THE SUBLIME[1],"ought at least to go beyond the adjective 'exceeding' or 'overwhelming,'"
1819,THE SUBLIME[1],and to substitute 'immeasurable' or 'incomparable' or 'infinite.'
1820,THE SUBLIME[1],
1821,THE SUBLIME[1],"Now, at the point we have reached, it would seem we might at once answer"
1822,THE SUBLIME[1],that a claim is here being made for the sublime in general which really
1823,THE SUBLIME[1],holds good only of one kind of sublimity. Sometimes the sublime object
1824,THE SUBLIME[1],"_is_ apprehended as the Infinite, or again as an expression of it. This"
1825,THE SUBLIME[1],"is, for example, a point of view frequent in Hebrew poetry. Sometimes,"
1826,THE SUBLIME[1],"again, the object (_e.g._ time or the heavens) is apprehended, not"
1827,THE SUBLIME[1],"indeed as _the_ Infinite, but still as infinite or immeasurable. But how"
1828,THE SUBLIME[1],"are we to say that a sublime lion or mountain, or Satan or Lady Macbeth,"
1829,THE SUBLIME[1],"is apprehended as the Infinite, or as infinite, or (usually) as even an"
1830,THE SUBLIME[1],expression of the Infinite? And how are we to say that the greatness of
1831,THE SUBLIME[1],most sublime objects is apprehended as incomparable or immeasurable? It
1832,THE SUBLIME[1],is only failure to observe these distinctions that leads to errors like
1833,THE SUBLIME[1],"one recorded in Coleridge's Table-talk (July 25, 1832): 'Could you ever"
1834,THE SUBLIME[1],"discover anything sublime, in our sense of the word, in the classic"
1835,THE SUBLIME[1],Greek literature? I never could. Sublimity is Hebrew by birth.'
1836,THE SUBLIME[1],
1837,THE SUBLIME[1],"This reply, however, though sound so far as it goes, does not settle the"
1838,THE SUBLIME[1],"question raised. It may still be maintained that sublimity in all cases,"
1839,THE SUBLIME[1],"and even when we have no idea of infinity before us, does represent the"
1840,THE SUBLIME[1],inadequacy of all finite forms to express the infinite. And it is
1841,THE SUBLIME[1],unfortunately impossible for us to deal fully with this contention. It
1842,THE SUBLIME[1],"would carry us into the region of metaphysics; and, while believing that"
1843,THE SUBLIME[1],no theory of the sublime can be complete which stops short of that
1844,THE SUBLIME[1],"region, I am aiming in this lecture at no such theory, but only at a"
1845,THE SUBLIME[1],result which may hold good without regard to further developments. All
1846,THE SUBLIME[1],"that I can do is to add a few words on the question whether, going"
1847,THE SUBLIME[1],"beyond the adjective 'exceeding' or 'overwhelming,' we can say that the"
1848,THE SUBLIME[1],"sublime is the beautiful which has immeasurable, incomparable, or"
1849,THE SUBLIME[1],infinite greatness. And the answer which I suggest and will go on to
1850,THE SUBLIME[1],"explain may be put thus: the greatness is only sometimes immeasurable,"
1851,THE SUBLIME[1],but it is _always_ unmeasured.
1852,THE SUBLIME[1],
1853,THE SUBLIME[1],We cannot apprehend an object as sublime while we apprehend it as
1854,THE SUBLIME[1],"comparably, measurably, or finitely great. Let the thing be what it"
1855,THE SUBLIME[1],"may--physical, vital, or spiritual--the moment we say to ourselves, 'It"
1856,THE SUBLIME[1],"is very great, but I know _how_ great,' or 'It is very great, but"
1857,THE SUBLIME[1],"something else is as great or greater,' at that moment it has ceased to"
1858,THE SUBLIME[1],be sublime. Outside the consciousness of its sublimity we may be
1859,THE SUBLIME[1],"perfectly well aware that a thing is limited, measurable, equal or"
1860,THE SUBLIME[1],inferior to something else. But then we are _not_ finding it sublime.
1861,THE SUBLIME[1],"And when we _are_ so finding it, we are absorbed in _its_ greatness, and"
1862,THE SUBLIME[1],have no thought either of the limits of that or of its equality or
1863,THE SUBLIME[1],"inferiority to anything else. The lion of whom we are thinking, 'An"
1864,THE SUBLIME[1],"elephant could kill him,' is no sublime lion. The Falls of Schaffhausen"
1865,THE SUBLIME[1],"are sublime when you are lost in astonishment at them, but not when you"
1866,THE SUBLIME[1],"are saying to yourself 'What must Niagara be!' This seems indubitable,"
1867,THE SUBLIME[1],"and hence we may say that, in one sense, all sublimity has unmeasured"
1868,THE SUBLIME[1],"greatness, and that no greatness is sublime which we apprehend as"
1869,THE SUBLIME[1],finite.
1870,THE SUBLIME[1],
1871,THE SUBLIME[1],But the absence of a consciousness of measure or finitude is one thing;
1872,THE SUBLIME[1],the presence of a consciousness of immeasurableness or infinity is
1873,THE SUBLIME[1],"another. The first belongs to all sublimity, the second only to one kind"
1874,THE SUBLIME[1],"of it,--to that where we _attempt_ to measure, or find limits to, the"
1875,THE SUBLIME[1],"greatness of the thing. _If_ we make this attempt, as when we try in"
1876,THE SUBLIME[1],"imagination to number the stars or to find an end to time, then it is"
1877,THE SUBLIME[1],"essential to sublimity that we should fail, and so fail that the idea of"
1878,THE SUBLIME[1],"immeasurability or endlessness emerges. In like manner, _if_ we compare"
1879,THE SUBLIME[1],"things, nothing will appear sublime whose greatness is surpassed or even"
1880,THE SUBLIME[1],"equalled by that of something else; and, if this process of comparison"
1881,THE SUBLIME[1],"is pursued, in the end nothing will be found sublime except the absolute"
1882,THE SUBLIME[1],"totality (however it may be imagined). And this kind of sublimity,"
1883,THE SUBLIME[1],"which arises from attempts to measure or compare, is often exceedingly"
1884,THE SUBLIME[1],striking. But it is only one kind. For it is an entire delusion--though
1885,THE SUBLIME[1],a very common one in theories of the sublime--to suppose that we _must_
1886,THE SUBLIME[1],"attempt to measure or compare. On the contrary, in the majority of cases"
1887,THE SUBLIME[1],our impression of overwhelming greatness is accompanied neither by any
1888,THE SUBLIME[1],"idea that this greatness has a measure, nor by the idea that it is"
1889,THE SUBLIME[1],immeasurable or infinite.[13]
1890,THE SUBLIME[1],
1891,THE SUBLIME[1],"It will not do, then, to lay it down that the sublime is the beautiful"
1892,THE SUBLIME[1],"which has immeasurable, incomparable, or infinite greatness. But I"
1893,THE SUBLIME[1],"suggest that, after the explanations given, we may conveniently use the"
1894,THE SUBLIME[1],"adjective 'unmeasured,' so long as we remember that this means one thing"
1895,THE SUBLIME[1],"where we do not measure at all, and another thing where we try to"
1896,THE SUBLIME[1],"measure and fail. And, this being so, it seems that we may say that"
1897,THE SUBLIME[1],"_all_ sublimity, and not only that in which the idea of infinite"
1898,THE SUBLIME[1],"greatness or of the Infinite emerges, is an image of infinity; for in"
1899,THE SUBLIME[1],"all, through a certain check or limitation and the overcoming of it, we"
1900,THE SUBLIME[1],"reach the perception or the imaginative idea of something which, on the"
1901,THE SUBLIME[1],"one hand, has a positive nature, and, on the other, is either _not_"
1902,THE SUBLIME[1],determined as finite or _is_ determined as infinite. But we must not add
1903,THE SUBLIME[1],that this makes the sublime superior to the 'beautiful.' For the
1904,THE SUBLIME[1],"'beautiful' too, though in a different way, is an image of infinity. In"
1905,THE SUBLIME[1],"'beauty,' as we said, that which appears in a sensuous form seems to"
1906,THE SUBLIME[1],"rest in that form, to be wholly embodied in it; it shows no tendency to"
1907,THE SUBLIME[1],"pass beyond it, and intimates no reserve of force that might strain or"
1908,THE SUBLIME[1],"break it. So that the 'beautiful' thing is a whole complete in itself,"
1909,THE SUBLIME[1],and in moments when beauty fills our souls we know what Wordsworth meant
1910,THE SUBLIME[1],"when he said 'the least of things seemed infinite,' though each thing,"
1911,THE SUBLIME[1],"being but one of many, must from another point of view, here suppressed,"
1912,THE SUBLIME[1],"be finite. 'Beauty,' then, we may perhaps say, is the image of the total"
1913,THE SUBLIME[1],presence of the Infinite within any limits it may choose to assume;
1914,THE SUBLIME[1],"sublimity the image of its boundlessness, and of its rejection of any"
1915,THE SUBLIME[1],pretension to independence or absoluteness on the part of its finite
1916,THE SUBLIME[1],"forms; the one the image of its immanence, the other of its"
1917,THE SUBLIME[1],transcendence.
1918,THE SUBLIME[1],
1919,THE SUBLIME[1],Within an hour I could attempt no more than an outline of our subject.
1920,THE SUBLIME[1],"That is inevitable; and so is another defect, which I regret more. In"
1921,THE SUBLIME[1],analysing any kind of aesthetic experience we have to begin by
1922,THE SUBLIME[1],disentangling the threads that meet in it; and when we can only make a
1923,THE SUBLIME[1],"beginning, no time is left for the further task of showing how they are"
1924,THE SUBLIME[1],"interwoven. We distinguish, for example, one kind of sublimity from"
1925,THE SUBLIME[1],"another, and we must do so; but in the actual experience, the single"
1926,THE SUBLIME[1],"instance, these kinds often melt together. I take one case of this."
1927,THE SUBLIME[1],"Trying to overlook the field in which sublimity appears, we say that"
1928,THE SUBLIME[1],"there is a sublimity of inorganic things, and of things vital, and of"
1929,THE SUBLIME[1],"things spiritual, and that these kinds differ. And this is true; and"
1930,THE SUBLIME[1],"perhaps it is also true that sometimes we experience one of these kinds,"
1931,THE SUBLIME[1],"so to say, quite pure and unmixed with others. But it is not always,"
1932,THE SUBLIME[1],"perhaps not usually so. More frequently kind mingles with kind, and we"
1933,THE SUBLIME[1],mutilate the experience when we name it after one of them. In life the
1934,THE SUBLIME[1],"imagination, touched at one point, tingles all over and responds at all"
1935,THE SUBLIME[1],"points. It is offered an impression of physical or vital greatness, but"
1936,THE SUBLIME[1],at once it brings from the other end of its world reminiscences of
1937,THE SUBLIME[1],"quite another order, and fuses the impression with them. Or an appeal is"
1938,THE SUBLIME[1],"made to the sense of spiritual greatness, but there rises before the"
1939,THE SUBLIME[1],imagination a vision with the outlines and hues of material Nature.
1940,THE SUBLIME[1],Offer it a sunset--a mere collection of coloured lines and spots--and
1941,THE SUBLIME[1],they become to it regrets and hopes and longings too deep for tears.
1942,THE SUBLIME[1],"Tell it of souls made perfect in bliss, and it sees an immeasurable"
1943,THE SUBLIME[1],"rose, or city-walls that flash with the light of all the gems on earth."
1944,THE SUBLIME[1],"The truth that a sparrow and a mountain are different, and that Socrates"
1945,THE SUBLIME[1],"is not Satan, interests it but little. What it cares for is the truth"
1946,THE SUBLIME[1],"that, when they are sublime, they are all the same; for each becomes"
1947,THE SUBLIME[1],"infinite, and it feels in each its own infinity."

1952,NOTES[14],NOTES[14]
1953,NOTES[14],
1954,NOTES[14],I add here a few remarks on some points which it was not convenient to
1955,NOTES[14],discuss in the lecture.
1956,NOTES[14],
1957,NOTES[14],1. We have seen that in the apprehension of sublimity we do not always
1958,NOTES[14],employ comparison or attempt to measure. To feel a thing overwhelmingly
1959,NOTES[14],great it is not necessary to have before the mind either the idea of
1960,NOTES[14],"something less great, or any standard of greatness. To argue that this"
1961,NOTES[14],must be necessary because 'great' means nothing except as opposed to
1962,NOTES[14],"'small,' is like arguing that I cannot have a perception of pride"
1963,NOTES[14],without thinking of humility.
1964,NOTES[14],
1965,NOTES[14],This point seems to me quite clear. But a question remains. If we go
1966,NOTES[14],"below consciousness, what is it that happens in us? The apprehension of"
1967,NOTES[14],sublimity implies that we have received an exceedingly strong
1968,NOTES[14],impression. This as a matter of fact must mean an impression very much
1969,NOTES[14],"stronger than something else; and this something else must be, so to"
1970,NOTES[14],"say, a standard with which the impression is unconsciously compared."
1971,NOTES[14],What then is it?
1972,NOTES[14],
1973,NOTES[14],"Stated in the most general terms, it must apparently be the usual or"
1974,NOTES[14],average strength of impressions.
1975,NOTES[14],
1976,NOTES[14],But this unconscious standard takes particular concrete forms in various
1977,NOTES[14],classes of cases. Not seldom it seems to be our sense of our own power
1978,NOTES[14],or of average human power. This is especially so where the thing felt to
1979,NOTES[14],"be sublime is, in the relevant respect, _in eodem genere_ with"
1980,NOTES[14],"ourselves. A sublime lion, for example, is immensely superior to us, or"
1981,NOTES[14],"to the average man, in muscular force and so in dangerousness,"
1982,NOTES[14],"Tourgénieff's sparrow in courage and love, a god in all sorts of ways."
1983,NOTES[14],And the use of this unconscious standard is probably the reason of the
1984,NOTES[14],"fact, noted in the lecture, that it is difficult to feel sublimity, as"
1985,NOTES[14],"regards vital force, in a creature smaller than ourselves."
1986,NOTES[14],
1987,NOTES[14],But this is not the only standard. A sublime lion is not only immensely
1988,NOTES[14],"stronger than we are, but is generally also exceptional among lions; and"
1989,NOTES[14],so with a sublime tree or bridge or thunderstorm. So that we seem also
1990,NOTES[14],to use as unconscious standard the idea of the average of the kind to
1991,NOTES[14],"which the thing belongs. An average thunderstorm hardly seems sublime,"
1992,NOTES[14],and yet it is overwhelmingly superior to us in power.[15]
1993,NOTES[14],
1994,NOTES[14],"What, again, is the psychical machinery employed when we attempt to"
1995,NOTES[14],"measure the shoreless sea, or time, and find them immeasurable? Is there"
1996,NOTES[14],any standard of the 'usual' here? I will leave this question to more
1997,NOTES[14],skilled psychologists than myself.
1998,NOTES[14],
1999,NOTES[14],2. Since the impression produced by sublimity is one of very exceptional
2000,NOTES[14],"strength, we are not able to feel it continuously for long, though we"
2001,NOTES[14],can repeat it after a pause. In this the sublime differs from the
2002,NOTES[14],"'beautiful,' on which we like to _dwell_ after our first surprise is"
2003,NOTES[14],over. A tragedy or symphony that was sublime from beginning to end could
2004,NOTES[14],"not be so experienced. Living among mountains, we feel their beauty more"
2005,NOTES[14],"or less constantly, their sublimity only by flashes."
2006,NOTES[14],
2007,NOTES[14],"3. If our account of the impression produced by sublimity is true, why"
2008,NOTES[14],should not any sensation whatever produce this impression merely by
2009,NOTES[14],"gaining extraordinary strength? It seems to me it would, supposing at"
2010,NOTES[14],its normal strength it conformed to the general requirements of
2011,NOTES[14],"aesthetic experience, and supposing the requisite accession of strength"
2012,NOTES[14],"did not remove this conformity. But this, in one respect at least, it"
2013,NOTES[14],"would do. It would make the light, sound, smell, physiologically"
2014,NOTES[14],"painful, and we should feel it as painful or even dangerous. We find"
2015,NOTES[14],this in the case of lightning. If it is to be felt as aesthetic it must
2016,NOTES[14],"not pass a certain degree of brightness; or, as we sometimes say, it"
2017,NOTES[14],must not be too 'near.'
2018,NOTES[14],
2019,NOTES[14],
2020,FOOTNOTES:,FOOTNOTES:
2021,FOOTNOTES:,
2022,FOOTNOTES:,[1] I have learned something from many discussions of this subject.
2023,FOOTNOTES:,In its outline the view I have taken is perhaps nearer to Hartmann's
2024,FOOTNOTES:,than to any other.
2025,FOOTNOTES:,
2026,FOOTNOTES:,"[2] Popular usage coincides roughly with this sense. Indeed, it can"
2027,FOOTNOTES:,hardly be said to recognise the wider one at all. 'Beauty' and
2028,FOOTNOTES:,"'beautiful,' in that wider sense, are technical terms of Aesthetics."
2029,FOOTNOTES:,It is a misfortune that the language of Aesthetics should thus differ
2030,FOOTNOTES:,from the ordinary language of speech and literature; but the
2031,FOOTNOTES:,"misfortune seems to be unavoidable, for there is no word in the"
2032,FOOTNOTES:,ordinary language which means 'whatever gives aesthetic
2033,FOOTNOTES:,"satisfaction,' and yet that idea _must_ have a name in Aesthetics."
2034,FOOTNOTES:,
2035,FOOTNOTES:,[3] I do not mean to imply that in aesthetic apprehension itself we
2036,FOOTNOTES:,"always, or generally, make conscious use of a standard or, indeed,"
2037,FOOTNOTES:,think of greatness. But here we are _reflecting_ on this
2038,FOOTNOTES:,apprehension.
2039,FOOTNOTES:,
2040,FOOTNOTES:,"[4] Thus, it may be noticed, the sparrow's size, which is the reverse"
2041,FOOTNOTES:,"of sublime, is yet indirectly essential to the sublimity of the"
2042,FOOTNOTES:,sparrow.
2043,FOOTNOTES:,
2044,FOOTNOTES:,[5] The poet's language here has done our analysis for us.
2045,FOOTNOTES:,
2046,FOOTNOTES:,[6] A word may be added here on a disputed point as to 'spiritual'
2047,FOOTNOTES:,sublimity. It has been held that intellect cannot be sublime; but
2048,FOOTNOTES:,surely in the teeth of facts. Not to speak of intellect as it appears
2049,FOOTNOTES:,"in the sphere of practice, how can it be denied that the intellect of"
2050,FOOTNOTES:,Aristotle or Shakespeare or Newton may produce the impression of
2051,FOOTNOTES:,"sublimity? All that is true is, first, that the intellect must be"
2052,FOOTNOTES:,apprehended imaginatively and not thought abstractly (otherwise it
2053,FOOTNOTES:,"can produce _no_ aesthetic impression), and, secondly, that it"
2054,FOOTNOTES:,appears sublime in virtue not of its quality alone but of the
2055,FOOTNOTES:,"quantity, or force, of that quality."
2056,FOOTNOTES:,
2057,FOOTNOTES:,"[7] The same principle applies to other cases. If, for example, the"
2058,FOOTNOTES:,"desolation of a landscape is felt to be sublime, it is so not as the"
2059,FOOTNOTES:,"mere negation of life, verdure, etc., but as their _active_ negation."
2060,FOOTNOTES:,
2061,FOOTNOTES:,"[8] The reader will remember that in one sense of the question, Is"
2062,FOOTNOTES:,there no more in the sublime than overwhelming greatness? this
2063,FOOTNOTES:,question must of course be answered in the affirmative. Sublimity is
2064,FOOTNOTES:,"a mode of beauty: the sublime is not the overwhelmingly great, it is"
2065,FOOTNOTES:,the beautiful which has overwhelming greatness; and it affects us
2066,FOOTNOTES:,"through its whole nature, not by mere greatness."
2067,FOOTNOTES:,
2068,FOOTNOTES:,[9] I am warning the reader against a mistake which may arise from
2069,FOOTNOTES:,the complexity of aesthetic experience. We may make a broad
2070,FOOTNOTES:,distinction between 'glad' and 'sad' modes of beauty; but that does
2071,FOOTNOTES:,not coincide with the distinction of modes with which we are
2072,FOOTNOTES:,concerned in this lecture. What is lovely or 'beautiful' may be glad
2073,FOOTNOTES:,"or sad, and so may what is grand or sublime."
2074,FOOTNOTES:,
2075,FOOTNOTES:,[10] In what follows I have spoken as if the two were always
2076,FOOTNOTES:,"successive stages, and as if these always came in the same order. It"
2077,FOOTNOTES:,"is easier to make the matter quickly clear by taking this view, which"
2078,FOOTNOTES:,also seemed to answer to my own experience. But I do not wish to
2079,FOOTNOTES:,"commit myself to an opinion on the point, which is of minor"
2080,FOOTNOTES:,importance. What is essential is to recognise the presence of the two
2081,FOOTNOTES:,"'aspects' or 'stages,' and to see that both are requisite to"
2082,FOOTNOTES:,sublimity.
2083,FOOTNOTES:,
2084,FOOTNOTES:,"[11] 'Ich fühlte mich so klein, so gross,' says Faust, remembering"
2085,FOOTNOTES:,"the vision of the Erdgeist, whom he addresses as 'Erhabener Geist.'"
2086,FOOTNOTES:,He was at once overwhelmed and uplifted.
2087,FOOTNOTES:,
2088,FOOTNOTES:,[12] At least if the 'Vision' is sublime its sublimity is not that of
2089,FOOTNOTES:,the original. We can 'discern the form thereof' distinctly enough.
2090,FOOTNOTES:,
2091,FOOTNOTES:,[13] To avoid complication I have passed by the case where we compare
2092,FOOTNOTES:,the sublime thing with another thing and find it much greater without
2093,FOOTNOTES:,"finding it immeasurably great. Here the greatness, it appears to me,"
2094,FOOTNOTES:,"is still unmeasured. That is to say, we do not attempt to determine"
2095,FOOTNOTES:,"its amount, and if we did we should lose the impression of sublimity."
2096,FOOTNOTES:,"We may _say_, perhaps, that it is ten, fifty, or a million times, as"
2097,FOOTNOTES:,great; but these words no more represent mathematical calculations
2098,FOOTNOTES:,than Hamlet's 'forty thousand brothers.'
2099,FOOTNOTES:,
2100,FOOTNOTES:,[14] I am far from being satisfied with the ideas imperfectly
2101,FOOTNOTES:,"expressed in the first and third of these Notes, but they require"
2102,FOOTNOTES:,more consideration than I can give to them during the printing of the
2103,FOOTNOTES:,Second Edition. The reader is requested to take them as mere
2104,FOOTNOTES:,suggestions.
2105,FOOTNOTES:,
2106,FOOTNOTES:,"[15] Hence a creature much less powerful than ourselves _may_, I"
2107,FOOTNOTES:,"suppose, be sublime, even from the mere point of view of vital"
2108,FOOTNOTES:,energy. But I doubt if this is so in my own case. I have seen
2109,FOOTNOTES:,"'magnificent' or 'glorious' cocks and cats, but if I called them"
2110,FOOTNOTES:,"'sublime' I should say rather more than I feel. I mention cocks,"
2111,FOOTNOTES:,because Ruskin somewhere mentions a sublime cock; but I cannot find
2112,FOOTNOTES:,"the passage, and this cock may have been sublime (if it really was so"
2113,FOOTNOTES:,to Ruskin) from some other than 'vital' greatness.

2126,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"later hand has rivalled, the only philosopher who has treated it in a"
2127,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],manner both original and searching is Hegel. I propose here to give a
2128,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"sketch of Hegel's theory, and to add some remarks upon it. But I cannot"
2129,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],possibly do justice in a sketch to a theory which fills many pages of
2130,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],the _Aesthetik_; which I must tear from its connections with the
2131,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"author's general view of poetry, and with the rest of his philosophy[2];"
2132,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],and which I must try to exhibit as far as possible in the language of
2133,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"ordinary literature. To estimate this theory, therefore, from my sketch"
2134,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"would be neither safe nor just--all the more because, in the interest of"
2135,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"immediate clearness, I have not scrupled to insert without warning"
2136,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],various remarks and illustrations for which Hegel is not responsible.
2137,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2138,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],On certain characteristics of tragedy the briefest reminder will
2139,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],suffice. A large part of the nature of this form of drama is common to
2140,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],the drama in all its forms; and of this nothing need be said. It will be
2141,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"agreed, further, that in all tragedy there is some sort of collision or"
2142,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"conflict--conflict of feelings, modes of thought, desires, wills,"
2143,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"purposes; conflict of persons with one another, or with circumstances,"
2144,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"or with themselves; one, several, or all of these kinds of conflict, as"
2145,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"the case may be. Again, it may be taken for granted that a tragedy is a"
2146,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"story of unhappiness or suffering, and excites such feelings as pity and"
2147,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"fear. To this, if we followed the present usage of the term, we should"
2148,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],add that the story of unhappiness must have an unhappy end; by which we
2149,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],mean in effect that the conflict must close with the death of one or
2150,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],more of the principal characters. But this usage of the word 'tragedy'
2151,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"is comparatively recent; it leaves us without a name for many plays, in"
2152,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"many languages, which deal with unhappiness without ending unhappily;"
2153,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],and Hegel takes the word in its older and wider sense.
2154,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2155,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Passing on from these admitted characteristics of tragedy, we may best"
2156,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],approach Hegel's peculiar view by observing that he lays particular
2157,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],stress on one of them. That a tragedy is a story of suffering is
2158,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],probably to many people the most obvious fact about it. Hegel says very
2159,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"little of this; partly, perhaps, because it is obvious, but more because"
2160,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"the essential point to him is not the suffering but its cause, namely,"
2161,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"the action or conflict. Mere suffering, he would say, is not tragic, but"
2162,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],only the suffering that comes of a special kind of action. Pity for mere
2163,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"misfortune, like fear of it, is not tragic pity or fear. These are due"
2164,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"to the spectacle of the conflict and its attendant suffering, which do"
2165,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],not appeal simply to our sensibilities or our instinct of
2166,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"self-preservation, but also to our deeper mind or spirit (_Geist_, a"
2167,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"word which, with its adjective, I shall translate 'spirit,' 'spiritual,'"
2168,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],because our words 'mind' and 'mental' suggest something merely
2169,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],intellectual).
2170,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2171,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],The reason why the tragic conflict thus appeals to the spirit is that it
2172,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"is itself a conflict of the spirit. It is a conflict, that is to say,"
2173,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],between powers that rule the world of man's will and action--his
2174,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"'ethical substance.' The family and the state, the bond of parent and"
2175,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"child, of brother and sister, of husband and wife, of citizen and ruler,"
2176,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"or citizen and citizen, with the obligations and feelings appropriate to"
2177,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"these bonds; and again the powers of personal love and honour, or of"
2178,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],devotion to a great cause or an ideal interest like religion or science
2179,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],or some kind of social welfare--such are the forces exhibited in tragic
2180,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"action; not indeed alone, not without others less affirmative and"
2181,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"perhaps even evil, but still in preponderating mass. And as they form"
2182,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"the substance of man, are common to all civilised men, and are"
2183,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"acknowledged as powers rightfully claiming human allegiance, their"
2184,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"exhibition in tragedy has that interest, at once deep and universal,"
2185,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],which is essential to a great work of art.
2186,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2187,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"In many a work of art, in many a statue, picture, tale, or song, such"
2188,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],powers are shown in solitary peace or harmonious co-operation. Tragedy
2189,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"shows them in collision. Their nature is divine, and in religion they"
2190,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"appear as gods; but, as seen in the world of tragic action, they have"
2191,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"left the repose of Olympus, have entered into human wills, and now meet"
2192,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"as foes. And this spectacle, if sublime, is also terrible. The"
2193,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],essentially tragic fact is the self-division and intestinal warfare of
2194,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"the ethical substance, not so much the war of good with evil as the war"
2195,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"of good with good. Two of these isolated powers face each other, making"
2196,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"incompatible demands. The family claims what the state refuses, love"
2197,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],requires what honour forbids. The competing forces are both in
2198,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"themselves rightful, and so far the claim of each is equally justified;"
2199,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"but the right of each is pushed into a wrong, because it ignores the"
2200,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"right of the other, and demands that absolute sway which belongs to"
2201,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"neither alone, but to the whole of which each is but a part."
2202,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2203,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],And one reason why this happens lies in the nature of the characters
2204,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"through whom these claims are made. It is the nature of the tragic hero,"
2205,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"at once his greatness and his doom, that he knows no shrinking or"
2206,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"half-heartedness, but identifies himself wholly with the power that"
2207,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"moves him, and will admit the justification of no other power. However"
2208,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"varied and rich his inner life and character may be, in the conflict it"
2209,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],is all concentrated in one point. Antigone _is_ the determination to do
2210,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],her duty to her dead brother; Romeo is not a son or a citizen as well as
2211,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"a lover, he is lover pure and simple, and his love is the whole of him."
2212,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2213,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],The end of the tragic conflict is the denial of both the exclusive
2214,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],claims. It is not the work of chance or blank fate; it is the act of the
2215,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"ethical substance itself, asserting its absoluteness against the"
2216,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"excessive pretensions of its particular powers. In that sense, as"
2217,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],proceeding from an absolute right which cancels claims based on right
2218,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"but pushed into wrong, it may be called the act of 'eternal justice.'"
2219,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Sometimes it can end the conflict peacefully, and the tragedy closes"
2220,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"with a solution. Appearing as a divine being, the spiritual unity"
2221,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],reconciles by some adjustment the claims of the contending powers
2222,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],(_Eumenides_); or at its bidding one of them softens its demand
2223,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"(_Philoctetes_); or again, as in the more beautiful solution of the"
2224,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"_Oedipus Coloneus_, the hero by his own self-condemnation and inward"
2225,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"purification reconciles himself with the supreme justice, and is"
2226,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],accepted by it. But sometimes the quarrel is pressed to extremes; the
2227,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],denial of the one-sided claims involves the death of one or more of the
2228,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],persons concerned; and we have a catastrophe. The ultimate power thus
2229,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"appears as a destructive force. Yet even here, as Hegel insists, the end"
2230,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],is not without an aspect of reconciliation. For that which is denied is
2231,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],not the rightful powers with which the combatants have identified
2232,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"themselves. On the contrary, those powers, and with them the only thing"
2233,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"for which the combatants cared, are affirmed. What is denied is the"
2234,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],exclusive and therefore wrongful assertion of their right.
2235,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2236,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],Such in outline is Hegel's main view. It may be illustrated more fully
2237,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"by two examples, favourites of his, taken from Aeschylus and Sophocles."
2238,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Clytemnestra has murdered Agamemnon, her husband and king. Orestes,"
2239,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"their son, is impelled by filial piety to avenge his father, and is"
2240,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],ordered by Apollo to do so. But to kill a mother is to sin against
2241,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],filial piety. The spiritual substance is divided against itself. The
2242,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],sacred bond of father and son demands what the equally sacred bond of
2243,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"son and mother forbids. When, therefore, Orestes has done the deed, the"
2244,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],Furies of his murdered mother claim him for their prey. He appeals to
2245,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Apollo, who resists their claim. A solution is arrived at without a"
2246,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"catastrophe. The cause is referred to Athene, who institutes at Athens a"
2247,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"court of sworn judges. The votes of this court being equally divided,"
2248,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],Athene gives her casting-vote for Orestes; while the Furies are at last
2249,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],appeased by a promise of everlasting honour at Athens.
2250,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2251,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"In the _Antigone_, on the other hand, to Hegel the 'perfect exemplar of"
2252,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"tragedy,' the solution is negative. The brother of Antigone has brought"
2253,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],against his native city an army of foreigners bent on destroying it. He
2254,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"has been killed in the battle, and Creon, the ruler of the city, has"
2255,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],issued an edict forbidding anyone on pain of death to bury the corpse.
2256,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"In so doing he not only dishonours the dead man, but violates the rights"
2257,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],of the gods of the dead. Antigone without hesitation disobeys the
2258,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"edict, and Creon, despite the remonstrance of his son, who is affianced"
2259,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"to her, persists in exacting the penalty. Warned by the prophet"
2260,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Teiresias, he gives way, but too late. Antigone, immured in a rocky"
2261,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"chamber to starve, has anticipated her death. Her lover follows her"
2262,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"example, and his mother refuses to survive him. Thus Antigone has lost"
2263,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],her life through her absolute assertion of the family against the state;
2264,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Creon has violated the sanctity of the family, and in return sees his"
2265,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],own home laid in ruins. But in this catastrophe neither the right of the
2266,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],family nor that of the state is denied; what is denied is the
2267,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],absoluteness of the claim of each.
2268,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2269,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],The danger of illustrations like these is that they divert attention
2270,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],from the principle illustrated to questions about the interpretation of
2271,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],particular works. So it will be here. I cannot stay to discuss these
2272,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"questions, which do not affect Hegel's principle; but it will be well,"
2273,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"before going further, to remove a misunderstanding of it which is"
2274,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],generally to be found in criticisms of his treatment of the _Eumenides_
2275,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],and the _Antigone_. The main objection may be put thus: 'Hegel talks of
2276,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],equally justified powers or claims. But Aeschylus never meant that
2277,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],Orestes and the Furies were equally justified; for Orestes was
2278,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],acquitted. Nor did Sophocles mean that Antigone and Creon were equally
2279,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],right. And how can it have been equally the duty of Orestes to kill his
2280,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"mother and not to kill her?' But, in the first place, it is most"
2281,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],important to observe that Hegel is not discussing at all what we should
2282,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"generally call the moral quality of the acts and persons concerned, or,"
2283,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"in the ordinary sense, what it was their duty to do. And, in the second"
2284,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"place, when he speaks of 'equally justified' powers, what he means, and,"
2285,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"indeed, sometimes says, is that these powers are _in themselves_ equally"
2286,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"justified. The family and the state, the bond of father and son, the"
2287,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"bond of mother and son, the bond of citizenship, these are each and all,"
2288,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"one as much as another, powers rightfully claiming human allegiance. It"
2289,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],is tragic that observance of one should involve the violation of
2290,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"another. These are Hegel's propositions, and surely they are true. Their"
2291,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],truth is quite unaffected by the fact (assuming it is one) that in the
2292,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],circumstances the act combining this observance of one and violation of
2293,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"another was morally right, or by the fact (if so it is) that one such"
2294,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"act (say Antigone's) was morally right, and another (say Creon's) was"
2295,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],morally wrong. It is sufficient for Hegel's principle that the violation
2296,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"should take place, and that we should feel its weight. We do feel it. We"
2297,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"may approve the act of Antigone or Orestes, but in approving it we still"
2298,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],feel that it is no light matter to disobey the law or to murder a
2299,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"mother, that (as we might say) there is much justice in the pleas of the"
2300,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Furies and of Creon, and that the _tragic_ effect depends upon these"
2301,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"facts. If, again, it is objected that the underlying conflict in the"
2302,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"_Antigone_ is not between the family and the state, but between divine"
2303,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"and human law, that objection, if sound, might touch Hegel's"
2304,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"interpretation,[3] but it would not affect his principle, except for"
2305,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],those who recognise no obligation in human law; and it will scarcely be
2306,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],contended that Sophocles is to be numbered among them. On the other
2307,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"hand, it is, I think, a matter for regret that Hegel employed such words"
2308,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"as 'right,' 'justified,' and 'justice.' They do not mislead readers"
2309,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"familiar with his writings, but to others they suggest associations with"
2310,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"criminal law, or our everyday moral judgments, or perhaps the theory of"
2311,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],'poetic justice'; and these are all out of place in a discussion on
2312,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],tragedy.
2313,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2314,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Having determined in outline the idea or principle of tragedy, Hegel"
2315,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],proceeds to give an account of some differences between ancient and
2316,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],modern works. In the limited time at our disposal we shall do best to
2317,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],confine ourselves to a selection from his remarks on the latter. For in
2318,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"speaking of ancient tragedy Hegel, who finds something modern in"
2319,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Euripides, makes accordingly but little use of him for purposes of"
2320,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"contrast, while his main point of view as to Aeschylus and Sophocles has"
2321,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],already appeared in the illustrations we have given of the general
2322,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"principle. I will only add, by way of preface, that the pages about to"
2323,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"be summarised leave on one, rightly or wrongly, the impression that to"
2324,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],his mind the principle is more adequately realised in the best classical
2325,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],tragedies than in modern works. But the question whether this really was
2326,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],his deliberate opinion would detain us too long from weightier
2327,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],matters.[4]
2328,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2329,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],Hegel considers first the cases where modern tragedy resembles ancient
2330,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],in dealing with conflicts arising from the pursuit of ends which may be
2331,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],called substantial or objective and not merely personal. And he points
2332,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],out that modern tragedy here shows a much greater variety. Subjects are
2333,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"taken, for example, from the quarrels of dynasties, of rivals for the"
2334,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"throne, of kings and nobles, of state and church. Calderon shows the"
2335,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],conflict of love and honour regarded as powers imposing obligations.
2336,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],Schiller in his early works makes his characters defend the rights of
2337,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"nature against convention, or of freedom of thought against"
2338,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],prescription--rights in their essence universal. Wallenstein aims at the
2339,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],unity and peace of Germany; Karl Moor attacks the whole arrangement of
2340,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],society; Faust seeks to attain in thought and action union with the
2341,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],Absolute. In such cases the end is more than personal; it represents a
2342,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"power claiming the allegiance of the individual; but, on the other"
2343,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"hand, it does not always or generally represent a great _ethical_"
2344,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],institution or bond like the family or the state. We have passed into a
2345,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],wider world.
2346,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2347,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"But, secondly, he observes, in regard to modern tragedy, that in a"
2348,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],larger number of instances such public or universal interests either do
2349,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"not appear at all, or, if they appear, are scarcely more than a"
2350,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"background for the real subject. The real subject, the impelling end or"
2351,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"passion, and the ensuing conflict, is personal,--these particular"
2352,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],characters with their struggle and their fate. The importance given to
2353,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"subjectivity--this is the distinctive mark of modern sentiment, and so"
2354,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],of modern art; and such tragedies bear its impress. A part at least of
2355,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],Hegel's meaning may be illustrated thus. We are interested in the
2356,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"personality of Orestes or Antigone, but chiefly as it shows itself in"
2357,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"one aspect, as identifying itself with a certain ethical relation; and"
2358,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],our interest in the personality is inseparable and indistinguishable
2359,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],from our interest in the power it represents. This is not so with
2360,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Hamlet, whose position so closely resembles that of Orestes. What"
2361,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],engrosses our attention is the whole personality of Hamlet in his
2362,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"conflict, not with an opposing spiritual power, but with circumstances"
2363,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"and, still more, with difficulties in his own nature. No one could think"
2364,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],of describing Othello as the representative of an ethical family
2365,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"relation. His passion, however much nobility he may show in it, is"
2366,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"personal. So is Romeo's love. It is not pursued, like Posa's freedom of"
2367,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"thought, as something universal, a right of man. Its right, if it could"
2368,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"occur to us to use the term at all, is Romeo's right."
2369,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2370,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],On this main characteristic of modern tragedy others depend. For
2371,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"instance, that variety of subject to which reference has just been made"
2372,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"depends on it. For when so much weight is attached to personality,"
2373,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],almost any fatal collision in which a sufficiently striking character is
2374,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"involved may yield material for tragedy. Naturally, again,"
2375,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"characterisation has become fuller and more subtle, except in dramas"
2376,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],which are more or less an imitation of the antique. The characters in
2377,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Greek tragedy are far from being types or personified abstractions, as"
2378,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],those of classical French tragedy tend to be: they are genuine
2379,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],individuals. But still they are comparatively simple and easy to
2380,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"understand, and have not the intricacy of the characters in Shakespeare."
2381,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"These, for the most part, represent simply themselves; and the loss of"
2382,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],that interest which attached to the Greek characters from their
2383,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"identification with an ethical power, is compensated by an extraordinary"
2384,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"subtlety in their portrayal, and also by their possession of some"
2385,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"peculiar charm or some commanding superiority. Finally, the interest in"
2386,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],personality explains the freedom with which characters more or less
2387,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],definitely evil are introduced in modern tragedy. Mephistopheles is as
2388,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],essentially modern as Faust. The passion of Richard or Macbeth is not
2389,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"only personal, like that of Othello; it is egoistic and anarchic, and"
2390,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],leads to crimes done with a full knowledge of their wickedness; but to
2391,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],the modern mind the greatness of the personality justifies its
2392,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"appearance in the position of hero. Such beings as Iago and Goneril,"
2393,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"almost portents of evil, are not indeed made the heroes of tragedies;"
2394,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"but, according to Hegel, they would not have been admitted in Greek"
2395,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],tragedy at all. If Clytemnestra had been cited in objection as a
2396,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"parallel to Lady Macbeth, he would have replied that Lady Macbeth had"
2397,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"not the faintest ground of complaint against Duncan, while in reading"
2398,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],the _Agamemnon_ we are frequently reminded that Clytemnestra's husband
2399,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],was the sacrificer of their child. He might have added that Clytemnestra
2400,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"is herself an example of the necessity, where one of the principal"
2401,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"characters inspires hatred or horror, of increasing the subtlety of the"
2402,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],drawing or adding grandeur to the evil will.
2403,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2404,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],It remains to compare ancient and modern tragedy in regard to the issue
2405,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],of the conflict. We have seen that Hegel attributes this issue in the
2406,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"former to the ethical substance or eternal justice, and so accounts for"
2407,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],such reconciliation as we feel to be present even where the end is a
2408,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"catastrophe. Now, in the catastrophe of modern tragedy, he says, a"
2409,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],certain justice is sometimes felt to be present; but even then it
2410,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],differs from the antique justice. It is in some cases more 'abstract':
2411,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"the end pursued by the hero, though it is not egoistic, is still"
2412,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],presented rather as his particular end than as something rightful though
2413,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"partial; and hence the catastrophe appears as the reaction, not of an"
2414,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"undivided ethical totality, but merely of the universal turning against"
2415,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"a too assertive particular.[5] In cases, again, where the hero (Richard"
2416,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"or Macbeth) openly attacks an ethical power and plunges into evil, we"
2417,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"feel that he meets with justice, and only gets what he deserves; but"
2418,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],then this justice is colder and more 'criminalistic' than that of
2419,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],ancient tragedy. Thus even when the modern work seems to resemble the
2420,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"ancient in its issue, the sense of reconciliation is imperfect. And"
2421,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"partly for this reason, partly from the concentration of our interest on"
2422,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"individuality as such, we desire to see in the individual himself some"
2423,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"sort of reconciliation with his fate. What shape this will take depends,"
2424,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"of course, on the story and the character of the hero. It may appear in"
2425,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"a religious form, as his feeling that he is exchanging his earthly being"
2426,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"for an indestructible happiness; or again, in his recognition of the"
2427,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"justice of his fall; or at least he may show us that, in face of the"
2428,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"forces that crush him to death, he maintains untouched the freedom and"
2429,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],strength of his own will.
2430,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2431,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"But there remain, says Hegel, many modern tragedies where we have to"
2432,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"attribute the catastrophe not to any kind of justice, but to unhappy"
2433,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],circumstances and outward accidents. And then we can only feel that the
2434,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],individual whose merely personal ends are thwarted by mere particular
2435,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"circumstances and chances, pays the penalty that awaits existence in a"
2436,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],scene of contingency and finitude. Such a feeling cannot rise above
2437,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"sadness, and, if the hero is a noble soul, it may become the impression"
2438,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],of a dreadful external necessity. This impression can be avoided only
2439,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],when circumstance and accident are so depicted that they are felt to
2440,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"coincide with something in the hero himself, so that he is not simply"
2441,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],destroyed by an outward force. So it is with Hamlet. 'This bank and
2442,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"shoal of time' is too narrow for his soul, and the death that seems to"
2443,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],fall on him by chance is also within him. And so in _Romeo and Juliet_
2444,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],we feel that the rose of a love so beautiful is too tender to bloom in
2445,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],the storm-swept valley of its birth. But such a feeling of
2446,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"reconciliation is still one of pain, an unhappy blessedness.[6] And if"
2447,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],the situation displayed in a drama is of such a kind that we feel the
2448,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],issue to depend _simply_ on the turn the dramatist may choose to give to
2449,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"the course of events, we are fully justified in our preference for a"
2450,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],happy ending.
2451,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2452,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"In this last remark (or rather in the pages misrepresented by it) Hegel,"
2453,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"of course, is not criticising Shakespeare. He is objecting to the"
2454,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"destiny-dramas of his own time, and to the fashionable indulgence in"
2455,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],sentimental melancholy. Strongly as he asserted the essential function
2456,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"of negation throughout the universe, the affirmative power of the"
2457,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"spirit, even in its profoundest divisions, was for him the deepest truth"
2458,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],and the most inspiring theme. And one may see this even in his
2459,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],references to Shakespeare. He appreciated Shakespeare's representation
2460,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"of extreme forms of evil, but, even if he was fully satisfied of its"
2461,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"justification, his personal preference lay in another direction, and"
2462,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],while I do not doubt that he thought _Hamlet_ a greater work than
2463,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"_Iphigenie_, I suspect he loved Goethe's play the best."
2464,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2465,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],Most of those who have thought about this subject will agree that the
2466,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],ideas I have tried to sketch are interesting and valuable; but they
2467,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"suggest scores of questions. Alike in the account of tragedy in general,"
2468,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"and in that of the differences between ancient and modern tragedy,"
2469,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],everyone will find statements to doubt and omissions to regret; and
2470,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],scarcely one of Hegel's interpretations of particular plays will escape
2471,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],objection. It is impossible for me to touch on more than a few points;
2472,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],and to the main ideas I owe so much that I am more inclined to dwell on
2473,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],their truth than to criticise what seem to be defects. But perhaps after
2474,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],all an attempt to supplement and amend may be the best way of throwing
2475,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],some part of Hegel's meaning more into relief. And I will begin with the
2476,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],attempt to supplement.
2477,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2478,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],He seems to be right in laying emphasis on the action and conflict in
2479,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],tragedy rather than on the suffering and misfortune. No mere suffering
2480,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"or misfortune, no suffering that does not spring in great part from"
2481,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"human agency, and in some degree from the agency of the sufferer, is"
2482,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"tragic, however pitiful or dreadful it may be. But, sufficient"
2483,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"connection with these agencies being present, misfortune, the fall from"
2484,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"prosperity to adversity, with the suffering attending it, at once"
2485,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"becomes tragic; and in many tragedies it forms a large ingredient, as"
2486,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"does the pity for it in the tragic feeling. Hegel, I think, certainly"
2487,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],takes too little notice of it; and by this omission he also withdraws
2488,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],attention from something the importance of which he would have admitted
2489,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"at once; I mean the way in which suffering is borne. Physical pain, to"
2490,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"take an extreme instance, is one thing: Philoctetes, bearing it, is"
2491,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],another. And the noble endurance of pain that rends the heart is the
2492,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],source of much that is best worth having in tragedy.
2493,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2494,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Again, there is one particular kind of misfortune _not_ obviously due to"
2495,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"human agency, which undoubtedly may affect us in a tragic way. I mean"
2496,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],that kind which suggests the idea of fate. Tragedies which represent man
2497,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"as the mere plaything of chance or a blank fate or a malicious fate, are"
2498,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"never really deep: it is satisfactory to see that Maeterlinck, a man of"
2499,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"true genius, has now risen above these ideas. But, where those factors"
2500,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"of tragedy are present which Hegel emphasises, the impression of"
2501,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"something fateful in what we call accident, the impression that the hero"
2502,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],not only invites misfortune by his exceptional stature and exceptional
2503,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"daring, but is also, if I may so put it, strangely and terribly unlucky,"
2504,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"is in many plays a genuine ingredient in tragic effect. It is so, for"
2505,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"example, in the _Oedipus Tyrannus_. It is so even in dramas like"
2506,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Shakespeare's, which exemplify the saying that character is destiny."
2507,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],Hegel's own reference to the prominence of accident in the plot of
2508,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],_Hamlet_ proves it. Othello would not have become Iago's victim if his
2509,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"own character had been different; but still, as we say, it is an"
2510,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],extraordinary fatality which makes him the companion of the one man in
2511,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"the world who is at once able enough, brave enough, and vile enough to"
2512,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"ensnare him. In the _Antigone_ itself, and in the very catastrophe of"
2513,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"it, accident plays its part: we can hardly say that it depends solely on"
2514,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],the characters of Creon and Antigone that the one yields just too late
2515,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"to save the life of the other. Now, it may be said with truth that"
2516,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],Hegel's whole account of the ultimate power in tragedy is a
2517,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"rationalisation of the idea of fate, but his remarks on this particular"
2518,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],aspect of fate are neither sufficient nor satisfactory.
2519,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2520,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],His insistence on the need for some element of reconciliation in a
2521,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"tragic catastrophe, and his remarks on the various forms it assumes,"
2522,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],have the greatest value; but one result of the omissions just noticed is
2523,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"that he sometimes exaggerates it, and at other times rates it too low."
2524,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"When he is speaking of the kind of tragedy he most approves, his"
2525,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],language almost suggests that our feeling at the close of the conflict
2526,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"is, or should be, one of complete reconciliation. This it surely neither"
2527,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"is nor can be. Not to mention the suffering and death we have witnessed,"
2528,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"the very existence of the conflict, even if a supreme ethical power is"
2529,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"felt to be asserted in its close, remains a painful fact, and, in large"
2530,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"measure, a fact not understood. For, though we may be said to see, in"
2531,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"one sense, how the opposition of spiritual powers arises, something in"
2532,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"us, and that the best, still cries out against it. And even the"
2533,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],perception or belief that it must needs be that offences come would not
2534,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"abolish our feeling that the necessity is terrible, or our pain in the"
2535,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"woe of the guilty and the innocent. Nay, one may conjecture, the feeling"
2536,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],and the pain would not vanish if we fully understood that the conflict
2537,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],and catastrophe were by a rational necessity involved in the divine and
2538,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],eternally accomplished purpose of the world. But this exaggeration in
2539,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Hegel's language, if partly due to his enthusiasm for the affirmative,"
2540,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"may be mainly, like some other defects, an accident of lecturing. In the"
2541,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"_Philosophy of Religion_, I may add, he plainly states that in the"
2542,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],solution even of tragedies like the _Antigone_ something remains
2543,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],unresolved (ii. 135).
2544,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2545,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"On the other hand, his treatment of the aspect of reconciliation in"
2546,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],modern tragedy is in several respects insufficient. I will mention only
2547,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],one. He does not notice that in the conclusion of not a few tragedies
2548,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"pain is mingled not merely with acquiescence, but with something like"
2549,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"exultation. Is there not such a feeling at the close of _Hamlet_,"
2550,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"_Othello_, and _King Lear_; and that although the end in the last two"
2551,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],cases touches the limit of legitimate pathos? This exultation appears to
2552,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],be connected with our sense that the hero has never shown himself so
2553,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],great or noble as in the death which seals his failure. A rush of
2554,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"passionate admiration, and a glory in the greatness of the soul, mingle"
2555,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"with our grief; and the coming of death, so far from destroying these"
2556,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"feelings, appears to leave them untouched, or even to be entirely in"
2557,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],harmony with them. If in such dramas we may be said to feel that the
2558,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"ultimate power is no mere fate, but a spiritual power, then we also feel"
2559,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],that the hero was never so near to this power as in the moment when it
2560,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],required his life.
2561,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2562,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],The last omission I would notice in Hegel's theory is that he underrates
2563,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],the action in tragedy of what may be called by a rough distinction moral
2564,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],evil rather than defect. Certainly the part played by evil differs
2565,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"greatly in different cases, but it is never absent, not even from"
2566,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],tragedies of Hegel's favourite type. If it does not appear in the main
2567,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"conflict, it appears in its occasion. You may say that, while Iago and"
2568,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Macbeth have evil purposes, neither the act of Orestes nor the vengeance"
2569,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"of the Furies, neither Antigone's breach of the edict nor even Creon's"
2570,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"insistence on her punishment, springs from evil in them; but the"
2571,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"situation with which Orestes or Antigone has to deal, and so in a sense"
2572,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"the whole tragedy, arises from evil, the murder of Agamemnon, and the"
2573,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"attempt of Polyneices to bring ruin on his native city. In fact, if we"
2574,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"confine the title 'tragedy' to plays ending with a catastrophe, it will"
2575,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"be found difficult to name great tragedies, ancient or modern, in which"
2576,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],evil has not directly or indirectly a prominent part. And its presence
2577,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],has an important bearing on the effect produced by the catastrophe. On
2578,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"the one hand, it deepens the sense of painful awe. The question why"
2579,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],affirmative spiritual forces should collide is hard enough; but the
2580,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"question why, together with them, there should be generated violent evil"
2581,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"and extreme depravity is harder and more painful still. But, on the"
2582,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"other hand, the element of reconciliation in the catastrophe is"
2583,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],strengthened by recognition of the part played by evil in bringing it
2584,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],about; because our sense that the ultimate power cannot endure the
2585,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],presence of such evil is implicitly the sense that this power is at
2586,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],least more closely allied with good. If it rejects the exaggerated
2587,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"claims of its own isolated powers, that which provokes from it a much"
2588,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],more vehement reaction must be still more alien to its nature. This
2589,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"feeling is forcibly evoked by Shakespeare's tragedies, and in many Greek"
2590,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],dramas it is directly appealed to by repeated reminders that what is at
2591,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],work in the disasters is the unsleeping Ate which follows an ancestral
2592,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],sin. If Aristotle did not in some lost part of the _Poetics_ discuss
2593,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"ideas like this, he failed to give a complete rationale of Greek"
2594,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],tragedy.
2595,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2596,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],I come lastly to the matter I have most at heart. What I take to be the
2597,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],central idea in Hegel's theory seems to me to touch the essence of
2598,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],tragedy. And I will not assert that his own statement of it fails to
2599,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"cover the whole field of instances. For he does not teach, as he is"
2600,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"often said to do, that tragedy portrays only the conflict of such"
2601,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"ethical powers as the family and the state. He adds to these, as we have"
2602,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"seen, others, such as love and honour, together with various universal"
2603,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],ends; and it may even be maintained that he has provided in his general
2604,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"statement for those numerous cases where, according to himself, no"
2605,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"substantial or universal ends collide, but the interest is centred on"
2606,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"'personalities.' Nevertheless, when these cases come to be considered"
2607,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"more fully--and, in Hegel's view, they are the most characteristically"
2608,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],modern cases--we are not satisfied. They naturally tend to appear as
2609,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],declensions from the more ideal ancient form; for how can a personality
2610,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],which represents only itself claim the interest of one which represents
2611,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"something universal? And further, they are sometimes described in a"
2612,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"manner which strikes the reader, let us say, of Shakespeare, as both"
2613,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"insufficient and misleading. Without raising, then, unprofitable"
2614,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"questions about the comparative merits of ancient and modern tragedy, I"
2615,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],should like to propose a restatement of Hegel's general principle which
2616,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],would make it more obviously apply to both.
2617,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2618,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"If we omit all reference to ethical or substantial powers and interests,"
2619,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],what have we left? We have the more general idea--to use again a formula
2620,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],not Hegel's own--that tragedy portrays a self-division and self-waste of
2621,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"spirit, or a division of spirit involving conflict and waste. It is"
2622,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],implied in this that on _both_ sides in the conflict there is a
2623,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"spiritual value. The same idea may be expressed (again, I think, not in"
2624,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],Hegel's own words) by saying that the tragic conflict is one not merely
2625,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"of good with evil, but also, and more essentially, of good with good."
2626,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Only, in saying this, we must be careful to observe that 'good' here"
2627,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"means anything that has spiritual value, not moral goodness alone,[7]"
2628,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],and that 'evil' has a similarly wide sense.
2629,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2630,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],Now this idea of a division of spirit involving conflict and waste
2631,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"covers the tragedies of ethical and other universal powers, and it"
2632,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],covers much besides. According to it the collision of such powers would
2633,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"be one kind of tragic collision, but only one. _Why_ are we tragically"
2634,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],moved by the conflict of family and state? Because we set a high value
2635,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],on family and state. Why then should not the conflict of anything else
2636,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],that has sufficient value affect us tragically? It does. The value must
2637,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],be sufficient--a moderate value will not serve; and other
2638,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"characteristics must be present which need not be considered here. But,"
2639,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"granted these conditions, _any_ spiritual conflict involving spiritual"
2640,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],waste is tragic. And it is just one greatness of modern art that it has
2641,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],shown the tragic fact in situations of so many and such diverse kinds.
2642,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],These situations have not the peculiar effectiveness of the conflicts
2643,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"preferred by Hegel, but they may have an equal effectiveness peculiar to"
2644,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],themselves.
2645,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2646,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],Let me attempt to test these ideas by choosing a most unfavourable
2647,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],instance--unfavourable because the play seems at first to represent a
2648,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"conflict simply of good and evil, and so, according both to Hegel's"
2649,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"statement and the proposed restatement, to be no tragedy at all: I mean"
2650,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],_Macbeth_. What is the conflict here? It will be agreed that it does not
2651,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"lie between two ethical powers or universal ends, and that, as Hegel"
2652,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"says, the main interest is in personalities. Let us take it first, then,"
2653,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"to lie between Macbeth and the persons opposing him, and let us ask"
2654,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],whether there is not spiritual value or good on both sides--not an equal
2655,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"amount of good (that is not necessary), but enough good on each to give"
2656,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],the impression of spiritual waste. Is there not such good in Macbeth? It
2657,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"is not a question merely of moral goodness, but of good. It is not a"
2658,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"question of the use made of good, but of its presence. And such bravery"
2659,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],and skill in war as win the enthusiasm of everyone about him; such an
2660,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],imagination as few but poets possess; a conscience so vivid that his
2661,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"deed is to him beforehand a thing of terror, and, once done, condemns"
2662,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],him to that torture of the mind on which he lies in restless ecstasy; a
2663,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"determination so tremendous and a courage so appalling that, for all"
2664,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"this torment, he never dreams of turning back, but, even when he has"
2665,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"found that life is a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing,"
2666,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],will tell it out to the end though earth and heaven and hell are leagued
2667,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"against him; are not these things, in themselves, good, and gloriously"
2668,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"good? Do they not make you, for all your horror, admire Macbeth,"
2669,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"sympathise with his agony, pity him, and see in him the waste of forces"
2670,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],on which you place a spiritual value? It is simply on this account that
2671,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"he is for you, not the abstraction called a criminal who merely 'gets"
2672,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"what he deserves' (art, like religion, knows no such thing), but a"
2673,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"tragic hero, and that his war with other forces of indubitable spiritual"
2674,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],worth is a tragic war.[8]
2675,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2676,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],It is required by the restatement of Hegel's principle to show that in
2677,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],the external conflict of persons there is good on both sides. It is not
2678,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"required that this should be true, secondly, of both sides in the"
2679,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],conflict within the hero's soul; for the hero is only a part of the
2680,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"tragedy. Nevertheless in almost all cases, if not in all, it is true. It"
2681,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"is obviously so where, as in the hero and also the heroine of the _Cid_,"
2682,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],the contending powers in this internal struggle are love and honour.
2683,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Even when love is of a quality less pure and has a destructive force, as"
2684,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"in Shakespeare's Antony, it is clearly true. And it remains true even"
2685,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"where, as in Hamlet and Macbeth, the contest seems to lie, and for most"
2686,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"purposes might conveniently be said to lie, between forces simply good"
2687,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"and simply the reverse. This is not really so, and the tragic effect"
2688,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],depends upon the fact. It depends on our feeling that the elements in
2689,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"the man's nature are so inextricably blended that the good in him, that"
2690,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"which we admire, instead of simply opposing the evil, reinforces it."
2691,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Macbeth's imagination deters him from murder, but it also makes the"
2692,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"vision of a crown irresistibly bright. If he had been less determined,"
2693,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"nay, if his conscience had been less maddening in its insistence that he"
2694,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"had thrown the precious jewel of his soul irretrievably away, he might"
2695,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"have paused after his first deed, might even have repented. Yet his"
2696,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"imagination, his determination, and his conscience were things good."
2697,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Hamlet's desire to do his duty is a good thing, but what opposes this"
2698,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],desire is by no means simply evil. It is something to which a
2699,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],substantial contribution is made by the qualities we most admire in him.
2700,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Thus the nature of tragedy, as seen in the external conflict, repeats"
2701,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"itself on each side of this conflict, and everywhere there is a"
2702,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],spiritual value in both the contending forces.
2703,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2704,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"In showing that _Macbeth_, a tragedy as far removed as possible from the"
2705,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"_Antigone_ as understood by Hegel, is still of one nature with it, and"
2706,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"equally answers to the account of tragedy proposed, it has been"
2707,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],necessary to ignore the great difference between the two plays. But when
2708,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"once the common essence of all tragedies has been determined, their"
2709,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],differences become the interesting subject. They could be distinguished
2710,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"according to the character of the collisions on which they are built, or"
2711,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],of the main forces which move the principal agents. And it may well be
2712,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"that, other things being equal (as they never are), the tragedy in which"
2713,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"the hero is, as we say, a good man, is more tragic than that in which he"
2714,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"is, as we say, a bad one. The more spiritual value, the more tragedy in"
2715,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"conflict and waste. The death of Hamlet or Othello is, so far, more"
2716,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"tragic than that of Macbeth, that of Macbeth than that of Richard. Below"
2717,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Richard stands Iago, a figure still tragic, but unfit for the hero's"
2718,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"part; below him persons like Regan or, in the very depth, Oswald,"
2719,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],characters no longer (at least in the dramatic sense) tragic at all.
2720,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"Moral evil, that is to say, so greatly diminishes the spiritual value we"
2721,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],ascribe to the personality that a very large amount of good of some kind
2722,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"is required to bring this personality up to the tragic level, the"
2723,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"destruction of evil as such being in no degree tragic. And again, it may"
2724,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"well be that, other things being equal, the more nearly the contending"
2725,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"forces approach each other in goodness, the more tragic is the conflict;"
2726,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"that the collision is, so far, more tragic in the _Antigone_ than in"
2727,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"_Macbeth_, and Hamlet's internal conflict than his struggle with outward"
2728,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],enemies and obstacles. But it is dangerous to describe tragedy in terms
2729,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"that even appear to exclude _Macbeth_, or to describe _Macbeth_, even"
2730,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"casually or by implication, in terms which imply that it portrays a"
2731,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],conflict of mere evil with mere good.
2732,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2733,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],The restatement of Hegel's main principle as to the conflict would
2734,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],involve a similar restatement as to the catastrophe (for we need not
2735,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"consider here those 'tragedies' which end with a solution). As before,"
2736,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"we must avoid any reference to ethical or universal ends, or to the work"
2737,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"of 'justice' in the catastrophe. We might then simply say that, as the"
2738,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"tragic action portrays a self-division or intestinal conflict of spirit,"
2739,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],so the catastrophe displays the violent annulling of this division or
2740,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"conflict. But this statement, which might be pretty generally accepted,"
2741,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"would represent only half of Hegel's idea, and perhaps nothing of what"
2742,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],is most characteristic and valuable in it. For the catastrophe (if I may
2743,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"put his idea in my own way) has two aspects, a negative and an"
2744,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"affirmative, and we have ignored the latter. On the one hand it is the"
2745,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"act of a power immeasurably superior to that of the conflicting agents,"
2746,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"a power which is irresistible and unescapable, and which overbears and"
2747,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"negates whatever is incompatible with it. So far, it may be called, in"
2748,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"relation to the conflicting agents,[9] necessity or fate; and unless a"
2749,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],catastrophe affects us in ways corresponding with this aspect it is not
2750,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],truly tragic. But then if this were all and this necessity were merely
2751,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"infinite, characterless, external force, the catastrophe would not only"
2752,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"terrify (as it should), it would also horrify, depress, or at best"
2753,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],provoke indignation or rebellion; and these are not tragic feelings. The
2754,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"catastrophe, then, must have a second and affirmative aspect, which is"
2755,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"the source of our feelings of reconciliation, whatever form they may"
2756,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],assume. And this will be taken into account if we describe the
2757,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],catastrophe as the violent self-restitution of the divided spiritual
2758,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"unity. The necessity which acts and negates in it, that is to say, is"
2759,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],yet of one substance with both the agents. _It_ is divided against
2760,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],itself in them; they are _its_ conflicting forces; and in restoring its
2761,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"unity through negation it affirms them, so far as they are compatible"
2762,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"with that unity. The qualification is essential, since the hero, for all"
2763,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"his affinity with that power, is, as the living man we see before us,"
2764,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"not so compatible. He must die, and his union with 'eternal justice'"
2765,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],(which is more than 'justice') must itself be 'eternal' or ideal. But
2766,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],the qualification does not abolish what it qualifies. This is no
2767,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"occasion to ask how in particular, and in what various ways in various"
2768,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"works, we feel the effect of this affirmative aspect in the catastrophe."
2769,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],But it corresponds at least with that strange double impression which is
2770,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"produced by the hero's death. He dies, and our hearts die with him; and"
2771,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"yet his death matters nothing to us, or we even exult. He is dead; and"
2772,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],he has no more to do with death than the power which killed him and with
2773,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],which he is one.
2774,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],
2775,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],I leave it to students of Hegel to ask whether he would have accepted
2776,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],the criticisms and modifications I have suggested. Naturally I think he
2777,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"would, as I believe they rest on truth, and am sure he had a habit of"
2778,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],"arriving at truth. But in any case their importance is trifling,"
2779,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],compared with that of the theory which they attempt to strengthen and to
2780,HEGEL'S THEORY OF TRAGEDY[1],which they owe their existence.

2785,NOTE,NOTE
2786,NOTE,
2787,NOTE,"Why did Hegel, in his lectures on Aesthetics, so treat of tragedy as to"
2788,NOTE,suggest the idea that the kind of tragedy which he personally preferred
2789,NOTE,(let us for the sake of brevity call it 'ancient') is also the most
2790,NOTE,adequate embodiment of the idea of tragedy? This question can be
2791,NOTE,"answered, I think, only conjecturally, but some remarks on it may have"
2792,NOTE,an interest for readers of Hegel (they are too brief to be of use to
2793,NOTE,others).
2794,NOTE,
2795,NOTE,One answer might be this. Hegel did not really hold that idea. But he
2796,NOTE,"was lecturing, not writing a book. He thought the principle of tragedy"
2797,NOTE,was more clearly and readily visible in ancient works than in modern;
2798,NOTE,"and so, for purposes of exposition, he emphasised the ancient form. And"
2799,NOTE,"this fact, with his personal enthusiasm for certain Greek plays, leads"
2800,NOTE,the reader of the _Aesthetik_ to misconstrue him.
2801,NOTE,
2802,NOTE,"Again, we must remember the facts of Hegel's life. He seems first to"
2803,NOTE,have reflected on tragedy at a time when his enthusiasm for the Greeks
2804,NOTE,"and their 'substantial' ethics was combined, not only with a"
2805,NOTE,contemptuous dislike for much modern 'subjectivity' (this he never
2806,NOTE,"ceased to feel), but with a certain hostility to the individualism and"
2807,NOTE,the un-political character of Christian morality. His first view of
2808,NOTE,"tragedy was thus, in effect, a theory of Aeschylean and Sophoclean"
2809,NOTE,tragedy; and it appears in the early essay on _Naturrecht_ and more
2810,NOTE,"fully in the _Phaenomenologie_. Perhaps, then, when he came to deal with"
2811,NOTE,"the subject more generally, he insensibly regarded the ancient form as"
2812,NOTE,"the typical form, and tended to treat the modern rather as a"
2813,NOTE,modification of this type than as an alternative embodiment of the
2814,NOTE,general idea of tragedy. The note in the _Rechtsphilosophie_ (p. 196)
2815,NOTE,perhaps favours this idea.
2816,NOTE,
2817,NOTE,"But, whether it is correct or no, I believe that the impression produced"
2818,NOTE,"by the _Aesthetik_ is a true one, and that Hegel did deliberately"
2819,NOTE,"consider the ancient form the more satisfactory. It would not follow, of"
2820,NOTE,"course, from that opinion that he thought the advantage was all on one"
2821,NOTE,"side, or considered this or that ancient poet greater than this or that"
2822,NOTE,"modern, or wished that modern poets had tried to write tragedies of the"
2823,NOTE,"Greek type. Tragedy would, in his view, be in somewhat the same position"
2824,NOTE,"as Sculpture. Renaissance sculpture, he might say, has qualities in"
2825,NOTE,"which it is superior to Greek, and Michael Angelo may have been as great"
2826,NOTE,an artist as Pheidias; but all the same for certain reasons Greek
2827,NOTE,"sculpture is, and probably will remain, sculpture _par excellence_. So,"
2828,NOTE,"though not to the same extent, with tragedy."
2829,NOTE,
2830,NOTE,And such a view would cohere with his general view of Art. For he taught
2831,NOTE,"that, in a sense, Classical Art is Art _par excellence_, and that in"
2832,NOTE,Greece beauty held a position such as it never held before and will not
2833,NOTE,hold again. To explain in a brief note how this position bears upon his
2834,NOTE,treatment of modern tragedy would be impossible: but if the student of
2835,NOTE,Hegel will remember in what sense and on what grounds he held it; that
2836,NOTE,he describes Beauty as the '_sinnliches_ Scheinen der Idee'; that for
2837,NOTE,him the new idea that distinguished Christianity and Romantic Art from
2838,NOTE,Greek religion and Classical Art is that '_unendliche_ Subjektivität'
2839,NOTE,"which implies a negative, though not merely negative, relation to sense;"
2840,NOTE,and that in Romantic Art this idea is not only exhibited in the
2841,NOTE,"religious sphere, but appears in the position given to personal honour,"
2842,NOTE,"love, and loyalty, and indirectly in what Hegel calls 'die formelle"
2843,NOTE,"Selbstständigkeit der individuellen Besonderheiten,' and in the fuller"
2844,NOTE,admission of common and un-beautiful reality into the realm of
2845,NOTE,"Beauty,--he will see how all this is connected with those"
2846,NOTE,characteristics of modern tragedy which Hegel regards as necessary and
2847,NOTE,"yet as, in part, drawbacks. This connection, which Hegel has no occasion"
2848,NOTE,"to work out, will be apparent even from consideration of the"
2849,NOTE,"introductory chapter on 'die romantische Kunstform,' _Aesthetik_, ii."
2850,NOTE,120-135.
2851,NOTE,
2852,NOTE,"There is one marked difference, I may add, between ancient and modern"
2853,NOTE,"tragedy, which should be considered with reference to this subject, and"
2854,NOTE,"which Hegel, I think, does not explicitly point out. Speaking roughly,"
2855,NOTE,"we may say that the former includes, while the latter tends to ignore,"
2856,NOTE,the accepted religious ideas of the time. The ultimate reason of this
2857,NOTE,"difference, on Hegel's view, would be that the Olympian gods are"
2858,NOTE,"themselves the '_sinnliches_ Scheinen der Idee,' and so are in the same"
2859,NOTE,"element as Art, while this is, on the whole, not so with modern"
2860,NOTE,religious ideas. One result would be that Greek tragedy represents the
2861,NOTE,total Greek mind more fully than modern tragedy can the total modern
2862,NOTE,mind.

2951,WORDSWORTH[1],"of his poetry prevalent among general readers, a disproportionate"
2952,WORDSWORTH[1],emphasis is often laid on certain aspects of his mind and writings. And
2953,WORDSWORTH[1],"I should like to offer some words of warning as to this tendency, and"
2954,WORDSWORTH[1],also some advice as to the spirit in which he should be approached. I
2955,WORDSWORTH[1],"will begin with the advice, though I am tempted at the last moment to"
2956,WORDSWORTH[1],"omit it, and simply to refer you to Mr. Raleigh, who throughout his book"
2957,WORDSWORTH[1],has practised what I am about to preach.
2958,WORDSWORTH[1],
2959,WORDSWORTH[1],
2960,WORDSWORTH[1],1.
2961,WORDSWORTH[1],
2962,WORDSWORTH[1],"There have been greater poets than Wordsworth, but none more original."
2963,WORDSWORTH[1],"He saw new things, or he saw things in a new way. Naturally, this would"
2964,WORDSWORTH[1],"have availed us little if his new things had been private fancies, or if"
2965,WORDSWORTH[1],his new perception had been superficial. But that was not so. If it had
2966,WORDSWORTH[1],"been, Wordsworth might have won acceptance more quickly, but he would"
2967,WORDSWORTH[1],"not have gained his lasting hold on poetic minds. As it is, those in"
2968,WORDSWORTH[1],"whom he creates the taste by which he is relished, those who learn to"
2969,WORDSWORTH[1],"love him (and in each generation they are not a few), never let him go."
2970,WORDSWORTH[1],"Their love for him is of the kind that he himself celebrated, a settled"
2971,WORDSWORTH[1],"passion, perhaps 'slow to begin,' but 'never ending,' and twined around"
2972,WORDSWORTH[1],the roots of their being. And the reason is that they find his way of
2973,WORDSWORTH[1],"seeing the world, his poetic experience, what Arnold meant by his"
2974,WORDSWORTH[1],"'criticism of life,' to be something deep, and therefore something that"
2975,WORDSWORTH[1],"will hold. It continues to bring them joy, peace, strength, exaltation."
2976,WORDSWORTH[1],It does not thin out or break beneath them as they grow older and wiser;
2977,WORDSWORTH[1],"nor does it fail them, much less repel them, in sadness or even in their"
2978,WORDSWORTH[1],sorest need. And yet--to return to our starting-point--it continues to
2979,WORDSWORTH[1],"strike them as original, and something more. It is not like"
2980,WORDSWORTH[1],"Shakespeare's myriad-mindedness; it is, for good or evil or both,"
2981,WORDSWORTH[1],"peculiar. They can remember, perhaps, the day when first they saw a"
2982,WORDSWORTH[1],"cloud somewhat as Wordsworth saw it, or first really understood what"
2983,WORDSWORTH[1],"made him write this poem or that; his unique way of seeing and feeling,"
2984,WORDSWORTH[1],"though now familiar and beloved, still brings them not only peace,"
2985,WORDSWORTH[1],"strength, exaltation, but a 'shock of mild surprise'; and his paradoxes,"
2986,WORDSWORTH[1],"long known by heart and found full of truth, still remain paradoxes."
2987,WORDSWORTH[1],
2988,WORDSWORTH[1],"If this is so, the road into Wordsworth's mind must be through his"
2989,WORDSWORTH[1],"strangeness and his paradoxes, and not round them. I do not mean that"
2990,WORDSWORTH[1],"they are everywhere in his poetry. Much of it, not to speak of"
2991,WORDSWORTH[1],"occasional platitudes, is beautiful without being peculiar or difficult;"
2992,WORDSWORTH[1],and some of this may be as valuable as that which is audacious or
2993,WORDSWORTH[1],"strange. But unless we get hold of that, we remain outside Wordsworth's"
2994,WORDSWORTH[1],"centre; and, if we have not a most unusual affinity to him, we cannot"
2995,WORDSWORTH[1],"get hold of that unless we realise its strangeness, and refuse to blunt"
2996,WORDSWORTH[1],"the sharpness of its edge. Consider, for example, two or three of his"
2997,WORDSWORTH[1],"statements; the statements of a poet, no doubt, and not of a"
2998,WORDSWORTH[1],"philosopher, but still evidently statements expressing, intimating, or"
2999,WORDSWORTH[1],"symbolising, what for him was the most vital truth. He said that the"
3000,WORDSWORTH[1],meanest flower that blows could give him thoughts that often lie too
3001,WORDSWORTH[1],"deep for tears. He said, in a poem not less solemn, that Nature was the"
3002,WORDSWORTH[1],soul of all his moral being; and also that she can so influence us that
3003,WORDSWORTH[1],nothing will be able to disturb our faith that all that we behold is
3004,WORDSWORTH[1],full of blessings. After making his Wanderer tell the heart-rending tale
3005,WORDSWORTH[1],"of Margaret, he makes him say that the beauty and tranquillity of her"
3006,WORDSWORTH[1],ruined cottage had once so affected him
3007,WORDSWORTH[1],
3008,WORDSWORTH[1],That what we feel of sorrow and despair
3009,WORDSWORTH[1],"From ruin and from change, and all the grief"
3010,WORDSWORTH[1],"The passing shows of Being leave behind,"
3011,WORDSWORTH[1],"Appeared an idle dream, that could not live"
3012,WORDSWORTH[1],Where meditation was.
3013,WORDSWORTH[1],
3014,WORDSWORTH[1],He said that this same Wanderer could read in the silent faces of the
3015,WORDSWORTH[1],"clouds unutterable love, and that among the mountains all things for him"
3016,WORDSWORTH[1],"breathed immortality. He said to 'Almighty God,'"
3017,WORDSWORTH[1],
3018,WORDSWORTH[1],But thy most dreaded instrument
3019,WORDSWORTH[1],For working out a pure intent
3020,WORDSWORTH[1],Is Man arrayed for mutual slaughter;
3021,WORDSWORTH[1],"Yea, Carnage is thy daughter."
3022,WORDSWORTH[1],
3023,WORDSWORTH[1],"This last, it will be agreed, is a startling statement; but is it a whit"
3024,WORDSWORTH[1],more extraordinary than the others? It is so only if we assume that we
3025,WORDSWORTH[1],"are familiar with thoughts that lie too deep for tears, or if we"
3026,WORDSWORTH[1],translate 'the soul of all my moral being' into 'somehow concordant with
3027,WORDSWORTH[1],"my moral feelings,' or convert 'all that we behold' into 'a good deal"
3028,WORDSWORTH[1],"that we behold,' or transform the Wanderer's reading of the silent faces"
3029,WORDSWORTH[1],of the clouds into an argument from 'design.' But this is the road round
3030,WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth's mind, not into it.[2]"
3031,WORDSWORTH[1],
3032,WORDSWORTH[1],"Again, with all Wordsworth's best poems, it is essential not to miss the"
3033,WORDSWORTH[1],unique tone of his experience. This doubtless holds good of any true
3034,WORDSWORTH[1],"poet, but not in the same way. With many poems there is little risk of"
3035,WORDSWORTH[1],"our failing either to feel what is distinctive of the writer, or to"
3036,WORDSWORTH[1],"appropriate what he says. What is characteristic, for example, in"
3037,WORDSWORTH[1],"Byron's lines, _On this day I complete my thirty-sixth year_, or in"
3038,WORDSWORTH[1],"Shelley's _Stanzas written in dejection near Naples_, cannot escape"
3039,WORDSWORTH[1],"discovery, nor is there any difficulty in understanding the mood"
3040,WORDSWORTH[1],"expressed. But with Wordsworth, for most readers, this risk is"
3041,WORDSWORTH[1],"constantly present in some degree. Take, for instance, one of the most"
3042,WORDSWORTH[1],"popular of his lyrics, the poem about the daffodils by the lake. It is"
3043,WORDSWORTH[1],popular partly because it remains a pretty thing even to those who
3044,WORDSWORTH[1],convert it into something quite undistinctive of Wordsworth. And it is
3045,WORDSWORTH[1],"comparatively easy, too, to perceive and to reproduce in imagination a"
3046,WORDSWORTH[1],"good deal that _is_ distinctive; for instance, the feeling of the"
3047,WORDSWORTH[1],"sympathy of the waves and the flowers and the breeze in their glee, and"
3048,WORDSWORTH[1],the Wordsworthian 'emotion recollected in tranquillity' expressed in the
3049,WORDSWORTH[1],"lines (written by his wife),"
3050,WORDSWORTH[1],
3051,WORDSWORTH[1],They flash upon that inward eye
3052,WORDSWORTH[1],Which is the bliss of solitude.
3053,WORDSWORTH[1],
3054,WORDSWORTH[1],But there remains something still more intimately Wordsworthian:
3055,WORDSWORTH[1],
3056,WORDSWORTH[1],I wandered lonely as a Cloud
3057,WORDSWORTH[1],That floats on high o'er vales and hills.
3058,WORDSWORTH[1],
3059,WORDSWORTH[1],"It is thrust into the reader's face, for these are the opening lines."
3060,WORDSWORTH[1],"But with many readers it passes unheeded, because it is strange and"
3061,WORDSWORTH[1],outside their own experience. And yet it is absolutely essential to the
3062,WORDSWORTH[1],effect of the poem.
3063,WORDSWORTH[1],
3064,WORDSWORTH[1],"This poem, however, even when thoroughly conventionalised, would remain,"
3065,WORDSWORTH[1],"as I said, a pretty thing; and it could scarcely excite derision. Our"
3066,WORDSWORTH[1],point is best illustrated from the pieces by which Wordsworth most
3067,WORDSWORTH[1],"earned ridicule, the ballad poems. They arose almost always from some"
3068,WORDSWORTH[1],"incident which, for him, had a novel and arresting character and came on"
3069,WORDSWORTH[1],his mind with a certain shock; and if we do not get back to this through
3070,WORDSWORTH[1],"the poem, we remain outside it. We may, of course, get back to this and"
3071,WORDSWORTH[1],yet consider the poem to be more or less a failure. There is here
3072,WORDSWORTH[1],therefore room for legitimate differences of opinion. Mr. Swinburne
3073,WORDSWORTH[1],"sees, no doubt, as clearly as Coleridge did, the intention of _The Idiot"
3074,WORDSWORTH[1],"Boy_ and _The Thorn_, yet he calls them 'doleful examples of"
3075,WORDSWORTH[1],"eccentricity in dullness,' while Coleridge's judgment, though he"
3076,WORDSWORTH[1],"criticised both poems, was very different. I believe (if I may venture"
3077,WORDSWORTH[1],into the company of such critics) that I see why Wordsworth wrote _Goody
3078,WORDSWORTH[1],"Blake and Harry Gill_ and the _Anecdote for Fathers_, and yet I doubt if"
3079,WORDSWORTH[1],"he has succeeded in either; but a great man, Charles James Fox, selected"
3080,WORDSWORTH[1],"the former for special praise, and Matthew Arnold included the latter in"
3081,WORDSWORTH[1],"a selection from which he excluded _The Sailor's Mother_.[3] Indeed, of"
3082,WORDSWORTH[1],all the poems at first most ridiculed there is probably not one that has
3083,WORDSWORTH[1],not been praised by some excellent judge. But they were ridiculed by
3084,WORDSWORTH[1],men who judged them without attempting first to get inside them. And
3085,WORDSWORTH[1],this is fatal.
3086,WORDSWORTH[1],
3087,WORDSWORTH[1],I may bring out the point by referring more fully to one of them. _Alice
3088,WORDSWORTH[1],"Fell_ was beloved by the best critic of the nineteenth century, Charles"
3089,WORDSWORTH[1],Lamb; but the general distaste for it was such that it was excluded 'in
3090,WORDSWORTH[1],policy' from edition after edition of Wordsworth's Poems; many still who
3091,WORDSWORTH[1],admire _Lucy Gray_ see nothing to admire in _Alice Fell_; and you may
3092,WORDSWORTH[1],"still hear the question asked, What could be made of a child crying for"
3093,WORDSWORTH[1],"the loss of her cloak? And what, I answer, could be made of a man poking"
3094,WORDSWORTH[1],his stick into a pond to find leeches? What sense is there in asking
3095,WORDSWORTH[1],"questions about the subject of a poem, if you first deprive this subject"
3096,WORDSWORTH[1],of all the individuality it possesses in the poem? Let me illustrate
3097,WORDSWORTH[1],this individuality methodically. A child crying for the loss of her
3098,WORDSWORTH[1],"cloak is one thing, quite another is a child who has an imagination, and"
3099,WORDSWORTH[1],who sees the tattered remnants of her cloak whirling in the wheel-spokes
3100,WORDSWORTH[1],of a post-chaise fiercely driven by strangers on lonesome roads through
3101,WORDSWORTH[1],"a night of storm in which the moon is drowned. She was alone, and,"
3102,WORDSWORTH[1],"having to reach the town she belonged to, she got up behind the chaise,"
3103,WORDSWORTH[1],and her cloak was caught in the wheel. And she is fatherless and
3104,WORDSWORTH[1],"motherless, and her poverty (the poem is called _Alice Fell, or"
3105,WORDSWORTH[1],Poverty_) is so extreme that for the loss of her weather-beaten rag she
3106,WORDSWORTH[1],does not 'cry'; she weeps loud and bitterly; weeps as if her innocent
3107,WORDSWORTH[1],heart would break; sits by the stranger who has placed her by his side
3108,WORDSWORTH[1],"and is trying to console her, insensible to all relief; sends forth sob"
3109,WORDSWORTH[1],"after sob as if her grief could never, never have an end; checks herself"
3110,WORDSWORTH[1],"for a moment to answer a question, and then weeps on as if she had lost"
3111,WORDSWORTH[1],"her only friend, and the thought would choke her very heart. It was"
3112,WORDSWORTH[1],_this_ poverty and _this_ grief that Wordsworth described with his
3113,WORDSWORTH[1],reiterated hammering blows. Is it not pathetic? And to Wordsworth it was
3114,WORDSWORTH[1],more. To him grief like this is sublime. It is the agony of a soul from
3115,WORDSWORTH[1],which something is torn away that was made one with its very being. What
3116,WORDSWORTH[1],"does it matter whether the thing is a woman, or a kingdom, or a tattered"
3117,WORDSWORTH[1],cloak? It is the passion that counts. Othello must not agonise for a
3118,WORDSWORTH[1],"cloak, but 'the little orphan Alice Fell' has nothing else to agonise"
3119,WORDSWORTH[1],for. Is all this insignificant? And then--for this poem about a child is
3120,WORDSWORTH[1],right to the last line--next day the storm and the tragedy have
3121,WORDSWORTH[1],"vanished, and the new cloak is bought, of duffil grey, as warm a cloak"
3122,WORDSWORTH[1],as man can sell; and the child is as pleased as Punch.[4]
3123,WORDSWORTH[1],
3124,WORDSWORTH[1],
3125,WORDSWORTH[1],2.
3126,WORDSWORTH[1],
3127,WORDSWORTH[1],"I pass on from this subject to another, allied to it, but wider. In"
3128,WORDSWORTH[1],"spite of all the excellent criticism of Wordsworth, there has gradually"
3129,WORDSWORTH[1],"been formed, I think, in the mind of the general reader a partial and"
3130,WORDSWORTH[1],misleading idea of the poet and his work. This partiality is due to
3131,WORDSWORTH[1],"several causes: for instance, to the fact that personal recollections of"
3132,WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth have inevitably been, for the most part, recollections of his"
3133,WORDSWORTH[1],later years; to forgetfulness of his position in the history of
3134,WORDSWORTH[1],"literature, and of the restricted purpose of his first important poems;"
3135,WORDSWORTH[1],"and to the insistence of some of his most influential critics, notably"
3136,WORDSWORTH[1],"Arnold, on one particular source of his power--an insistence perfectly"
3137,WORDSWORTH[1],"just, but accompanied now and then by a lack of sympathy with other"
3138,WORDSWORTH[1],aspects of his poetry. The result is an idea of him which is mainly true
3139,WORDSWORTH[1],"and really characteristic, but yet incomplete, and so, in a sense,"
3140,WORDSWORTH[1],"untrue; a picture, I might say, somewhat like Millais' first portrait of"
3141,WORDSWORTH[1],"Gladstone, which renders the inspiration, the beauty, the light, but"
3142,WORDSWORTH[1],"not the sternness or imperiousness, and not all of the power and fire."
3143,WORDSWORTH[1],"Let me try to express this idea, which, it is needless to say, I do not"
3144,WORDSWORTH[1],"attribute, in the shape here given to it, to anyone in particular."
3145,WORDSWORTH[1],
3146,WORDSWORTH[1],"It was not Wordsworth's function to sing, like most great poets, of war,"
3147,WORDSWORTH[1],"or love, or tragic passions, or the actions of supernatural beings. His"
3148,WORDSWORTH[1],peculiar function was 'to open out the soul of little and familiar
3149,WORDSWORTH[1],"things,' alike in nature and in human life. His 'poetry is great because"
3150,WORDSWORTH[1],of the extraordinary power with which he feels the joy offered to us in
3151,WORDSWORTH[1],"nature, the joy offered to us in the simple primary affections and"
3152,WORDSWORTH[1],"duties.' His field was therefore narrow; and, besides, he was deficient"
3153,WORDSWORTH[1],"in romance, his moral sympathies were somewhat limited, and he tended"
3154,WORDSWORTH[1],also to ignore the darker aspects of the world. But in this very
3155,WORDSWORTH[1],optimism lay his strength. The gulf which for Byron and Shelley yawned
3156,WORDSWORTH[1],"between the real and the ideal, had no existence for him. For him the"
3157,WORDSWORTH[1],"ideal was realised, and Utopia a country which he saw every day, and"
3158,WORDSWORTH[1],"which, he thought, every man might see who did not strive, nor cry, nor"
3159,WORDSWORTH[1],"rebel, but opened his heart in love and thankfulness to sweet influences"
3160,WORDSWORTH[1],as universal and perpetual as the air. The spirit of his poetry was also
3161,WORDSWORTH[1],that of his life--a life full of strong but peaceful affections; of a
3162,WORDSWORTH[1],communion with nature in keen but calm and meditative joy; of perfect
3163,WORDSWORTH[1],devotion to the mission with which he held himself charged; and of a
3164,WORDSWORTH[1],natural piety gradually assuming a more distinctively religious tone.
3165,WORDSWORTH[1],"Some verses of his own best describe him, and some verses of Matthew"
3166,WORDSWORTH[1],Arnold his influence on his readers. These are his own words (from _A
3167,WORDSWORTH[1],Poet's Epitaph_):
3168,WORDSWORTH[1],
3169,WORDSWORTH[1],"But who is he, with modest looks,"
3170,WORDSWORTH[1],And clad in homely russet brown?
3171,WORDSWORTH[1],He murmurs near the running brooks
3172,WORDSWORTH[1],A music sweeter than their own.
3173,WORDSWORTH[1],
3174,WORDSWORTH[1],
3175,WORDSWORTH[1],"He is retired as noontide dew,"
3176,WORDSWORTH[1],Or fountain in a noon-day grove;
3177,WORDSWORTH[1],"And you must love him, ere to you"
3178,WORDSWORTH[1],He will seem worthy of your love.
3179,WORDSWORTH[1],
3180,WORDSWORTH[1],"The outward shows of sky and earth,"
3181,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of hill and valley, he has viewed;"
3182,WORDSWORTH[1],And impulses of deeper birth
3183,WORDSWORTH[1],Have come to him in solitude.
3184,WORDSWORTH[1],
3185,WORDSWORTH[1],In common things that round us lie
3186,WORDSWORTH[1],"Some random truths he can impart,"
3187,WORDSWORTH[1],--The harvest of a quiet eye
3188,WORDSWORTH[1],That broods and sleeps on his own heart.
3189,WORDSWORTH[1],
3190,WORDSWORTH[1],"But he is weak; both man and boy,"
3191,WORDSWORTH[1],Hath been an idler in the land:
3192,WORDSWORTH[1],Contented if he might enjoy
3193,WORDSWORTH[1],The things which others understand.
3194,WORDSWORTH[1],
3195,WORDSWORTH[1],And these are the words from Arnold's _Memorial Verses_:
3196,WORDSWORTH[1],
3197,WORDSWORTH[1],He too upon a wintry clime
3198,WORDSWORTH[1],Had fallen--on this iron time
3199,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of doubts, disputes, distractions, fears"
3200,WORDSWORTH[1],He found us when the age had bound
3201,WORDSWORTH[1],Our souls in its benumbing round--
3202,WORDSWORTH[1],"He spoke, and loosed our heart in tears."
3203,WORDSWORTH[1],He laid us as we lay at birth
3204,WORDSWORTH[1],On the cool flowery lap of earth;
3205,WORDSWORTH[1],Smiles broke from us and we had ease.
3206,WORDSWORTH[1],"The hills were round us, and the breeze"
3207,WORDSWORTH[1],Went o'er the sunlit fields again;
3208,WORDSWORTH[1],Our foreheads felt the wind and rain.
3209,WORDSWORTH[1],Our youth returned: for there was shed
3210,WORDSWORTH[1],"On spirits that had long been dead,"
3211,WORDSWORTH[1],"Spirits dried up and closely furled,"
3212,WORDSWORTH[1],The freshness of the early world.
3213,WORDSWORTH[1],
3214,WORDSWORTH[1],"Ah, since dark days still bring to light"
3215,WORDSWORTH[1],"Man's prudence and man's fiery might,"
3216,WORDSWORTH[1],Time may restore us in his course
3217,WORDSWORTH[1],Goethe's sage mind and Byron's force;
3218,WORDSWORTH[1],But where will Europe's latter hour
3219,WORDSWORTH[1],Again find Wordsworth's healing power?
3220,WORDSWORTH[1],"Others will teach us how to dare,"
3221,WORDSWORTH[1],And against fear our breast to steel;
3222,WORDSWORTH[1],Others will strengthen us to bear--
3223,WORDSWORTH[1],"But who, ah who, will make us feel?"
3224,WORDSWORTH[1],"The cloud of mortal destiny,"
3225,WORDSWORTH[1],Others will front it fearlessly--
3226,WORDSWORTH[1],"But who, like him, will put it by?"
3227,WORDSWORTH[1],
3228,WORDSWORTH[1],"Keep fresh the grass upon his grave,"
3229,WORDSWORTH[1],O Rotha! with thy living wave.
3230,WORDSWORTH[1],Sing him thy best! for few or none
3231,WORDSWORTH[1],"Hears thy voice right, now he is gone."
3232,WORDSWORTH[1],
3233,WORDSWORTH[1],"Those last words are enough to disarm dissent. No, that voice will never"
3234,WORDSWORTH[1],"again be heard quite right now Wordsworth is gone. Nor is it, for the"
3235,WORDSWORTH[1],"most part, dissent that I wish to express. The picture we have been"
3236,WORDSWORTH[1],"looking at, though we may question the accuracy of this line or that,"
3237,WORDSWORTH[1],"seems to me, I repeat, substantially true. But is there nothing missing?"
3238,WORDSWORTH[1],"Consider this picture, and refuse to go beyond it, and then ask if it"
3239,WORDSWORTH[1],accounts for all that is most characteristic in Wordsworth. How did the
3240,WORDSWORTH[1],"man in the picture ever come to write the Immortality _Ode_, or"
3241,WORDSWORTH[1],"_Yew-trees_, or why should he say,"
3242,WORDSWORTH[1],
3243,WORDSWORTH[1],"For I must tread on shadowy ground, must sink"
3244,WORDSWORTH[1],"Deep--and, aloft ascending, breathe in worlds"
3245,WORDSWORTH[1],To which the heaven of heavens is but a veil?
3246,WORDSWORTH[1],
3247,WORDSWORTH[1],"How, again, could he say that Carnage is God's daughter, or write the"
3248,WORDSWORTH[1],"_Sonnets dedicated to National Liberty and Independence_, or the tract"
3249,WORDSWORTH[1],on the Convention of Cintra? Can it be true of him that many of his
3250,WORDSWORTH[1],best-known poems of human life--perhaps the majority--deal with painful
3251,WORDSWORTH[1],"subjects, and not a few with extreme suffering? Should we expect him to"
3252,WORDSWORTH[1],"make an 'idol' of Milton, or to show a 'strong predilection for such"
3253,WORDSWORTH[1],"geniuses as Dante and Michael Angelo'? He might easily be 'reserved,'"
3254,WORDSWORTH[1],"but is it not surprising to find him described as haughty, prouder than"
3255,WORDSWORTH[1],"Lucifer, inhumanly arrogant? Why should his forehead have been marked by"
3256,WORDSWORTH[1],"the 'severe worn pressure of thought,' or his eyes have looked so"
3257,WORDSWORTH[1],"'supernatural ... like fires, half burning, half smouldering, with a"
3258,WORDSWORTH[1],"sort of acrid fixture of regard, and seated at the further end of two"
3259,WORDSWORTH[1],caverns'? In all this there need be nothing inconsistent with the
3260,WORDSWORTH[1],picture we have been looking at; but that picture fails to suggest it.
3261,WORDSWORTH[1],"In that way the likeness it presents is only partial, and I propose to"
3262,WORDSWORTH[1],emphasise some of the traits which it omits or marks too faintly.[5]
3263,WORDSWORTH[1],
3264,WORDSWORTH[1],And first as to the restriction of Wordsworth's field. Certainly his
3265,WORDSWORTH[1],"field, as compared with that of some poets, is narrow; but to describe"
3266,WORDSWORTH[1],"it as confined to external nature and peasant life, or to little and"
3267,WORDSWORTH[1],"familiar things, would be absurdly untrue, as a mere glance at his Table"
3268,WORDSWORTH[1],of Contents suffices to show. And its actual restriction was not due to
3269,WORDSWORTH[1],"any false theory, nor mainly to any narrowness of outlook. It was due,"
3270,WORDSWORTH[1],"apart from limitation of endowment, on the one hand to that diminution"
3271,WORDSWORTH[1],"of poetic energy which in Wordsworth began comparatively soon, and on"
3272,WORDSWORTH[1],"the other, especially in his best days, to deliberate choice; and we"
3273,WORDSWORTH[1],must not assume without question that he was inherently incapable of
3274,WORDSWORTH[1],"doing either what he would not do, or what, in his last five and thirty"
3275,WORDSWORTH[1],"years, he could no longer do."
3276,WORDSWORTH[1],
3277,WORDSWORTH[1],There is no reason to suppose that Wordsworth undervalued or objected to
3278,WORDSWORTH[1],"the subjects of such poets as Homer and Virgil, Chaucer and Spenser,"
3279,WORDSWORTH[1],"Shakespeare and Milton. And when, after writing his part of the _Lyrical"
3280,WORDSWORTH[1],"Ballads_, he returned from Germany and settled in the Lake Country, the"
3281,WORDSWORTH[1],subjects he himself revolved for a great poem were not concerned with
3282,WORDSWORTH[1],"rural life or humble persons. Some old 'romantic' British theme, left"
3283,WORDSWORTH[1],"unsung by Milton; some tale of Chivalry, dire enchantments, war-like"
3284,WORDSWORTH[1],feats; vanquished Mithridates passing north and becoming Odin; the
3285,WORDSWORTH[1],fortunes of the followers of Sertorius; de Gourgues' journey of
3286,WORDSWORTH[1],vengeance to Florida; Gustavus; Wallace and his exploits in the war for
3287,WORDSWORTH[1],"his country's independence,--these are the subjects he names first. And,"
3288,WORDSWORTH[1],though his 'last and favourite aspiration' was towards
3289,WORDSWORTH[1],
3290,WORDSWORTH[1],Some philosophic song
3291,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of Truth that cherishes our daily life,"
3292,WORDSWORTH[1],
3293,WORDSWORTH[1],"--that song which was never completed--yet, some ten years later, he"
3294,WORDSWORTH[1],"still hoped, when it should be finished, to write an epic. Whether at"
3295,WORDSWORTH[1],"any time he was fitted for the task or no, he wished to undertake it;"
3296,WORDSWORTH[1],"and his addiction, by no means entire even in his earlier days, to"
3297,WORDSWORTH[1],"little and familiar things was due, not at all to an opinion that they"
3298,WORDSWORTH[1],"are the only right subjects or the best, nor merely to a natural"
3299,WORDSWORTH[1],"predilection for them, but to the belief that a particular kind of"
3300,WORDSWORTH[1],poetry was wanted at that time to counteract its special evils. There
3301,WORDSWORTH[1],"prevailed, he thought, a 'degrading thirst after outrageous"
3302,WORDSWORTH[1],"stimulation.' The violent excitement of public events, and 'the"
3303,WORDSWORTH[1],"increasing accumulation of men in cities, where the uniformity of their"
3304,WORDSWORTH[1],"occupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident, which the"
3305,WORDSWORTH[1],"rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies,' had induced a"
3306,WORDSWORTH[1],torpor of mind which only yielded to gross and sensational effects--such
3307,WORDSWORTH[1],"effects as were produced by 'frantic novels,' of the Radcliffe or Monk"
3308,WORDSWORTH[1],"Lewis type, full of mysterious criminals, gloomy castles and terrifying"
3309,WORDSWORTH[1],spectres. He wanted to oppose to this tendency one as far removed from
3310,WORDSWORTH[1],it as possible; to write a poetry even _more_ alien to it than
3311,WORDSWORTH[1],Shakespeare's tragedies or Spenser's stories of knights and dragons; to
3312,WORDSWORTH[1],"show men that wonder and beauty can be felt, and the heart be moved,"
3313,WORDSWORTH[1],"even when the rate of the pulse is perfectly normal. In the same way, he"
3314,WORDSWORTH[1],grieved Coleridge by refusing to interest himself in the Somersetshire
3315,WORDSWORTH[1],"fairies, and declared that he desired for his scene no planet but the"
3316,WORDSWORTH[1],"earth, and no region of the earth stranger than England and the lowliest"
3317,WORDSWORTH[1],"ways in England. And, being by no means merely a gentle shepherd, but a"
3318,WORDSWORTH[1],born fighter who was easily provoked and could swing his crook with
3319,WORDSWORTH[1],"uncommon force, he asserted his convictions defiantly and carried them"
3320,WORDSWORTH[1],"out to extremes. And so in later days, after he had somewhat narrowed,"
3321,WORDSWORTH[1],when in the Seventh Book of the _Excursion_ he made the Pastor protest
3322,WORDSWORTH[1],"that poetry was not wanted to multiply and aggravate the din of war, or"
3323,WORDSWORTH[1],"to propagate the pangs and turbulence of passionate love, he did this"
3324,WORDSWORTH[1],perhaps because the world which would not listen to him[6] was
3325,WORDSWORTH[1],enraptured by _Marmion_ and the earlier poems of Byron.
3326,WORDSWORTH[1],
3327,WORDSWORTH[1],How great Wordsworth's success might have been in fields which he
3328,WORDSWORTH[1],"deliberately avoided, it is perhaps idle to conjecture. I do not suppose"
3329,WORDSWORTH[1],"it would have been very great, but I see no reason to believe that he"
3330,WORDSWORTH[1],"would have failed. With regard, for instance, to love, one cannot read"
3331,WORDSWORTH[1],"without a smile his reported statement that, had he been a writer of"
3332,WORDSWORTH[1],"love-poetry, it would have been natural to him to write it with a degree"
3333,WORDSWORTH[1],"of warmth which could hardly have been approved by his principles, and"
3334,WORDSWORTH[1],which might have been undesirable for the reader. But one may smile at
3335,WORDSWORTH[1],"his naïveté without disbelieving his statement. And, in fact, Wordsworth"
3336,WORDSWORTH[1],neither wholly avoided the subject nor failed when he touched it. The
3337,WORDSWORTH[1],"poems about Lucy are not poems of passion, in the usual sense, but they"
3338,WORDSWORTH[1],surely are love-poems. The verses _'Tis said that some have died for
3339,WORDSWORTH[1],"love_, excluded from Arnold's selection but praised by Ruskin, are"
3340,WORDSWORTH[1],poignant enough. And the following lines from _Vaudracour and Julia_
3341,WORDSWORTH[1],make one wonder how this could be to Arnold the only poem of
3342,WORDSWORTH[1],Wordsworth's that he could not read with pleasure:
3343,WORDSWORTH[1],
3344,WORDSWORTH[1],Arabian fiction never filled the world
3345,WORDSWORTH[1],With half the wonders that were wrought for him.
3346,WORDSWORTH[1],Earth breathed in one great presence of the spring;
3347,WORDSWORTH[1],"Life turned the meanest of her implements,"
3348,WORDSWORTH[1],"Before his eyes, to price above all gold;"
3349,WORDSWORTH[1],The house she dwelt in was a sainted shrine;
3350,WORDSWORTH[1],Her chamber-window did surpass in glory
3351,WORDSWORTH[1],The portals of the dawn; all paradise
3352,WORDSWORTH[1],"Could, by the simple opening of a door,"
3353,WORDSWORTH[1],"Let itself in upon him:--pathways, walks,"
3354,WORDSWORTH[1],"Swarmed with enchantment, till his spirit sank,"
3355,WORDSWORTH[1],"Surcharged, within him, overblest to move"
3356,WORDSWORTH[1],Beneath a sun that wakes a weary world
3357,WORDSWORTH[1],To its dull round of ordinary cares;
3358,WORDSWORTH[1],A man too happy for mortality!
3359,WORDSWORTH[1],
3360,WORDSWORTH[1],"As a whole, _Vaudracour and Julia_ is a failure, but these lines haunt"
3361,WORDSWORTH[1],"my memory, and I cannot think them a poor description of that which they"
3362,WORDSWORTH[1],"profess to describe. This is not precisely 'passion,' and, I admit, they"
3363,WORDSWORTH[1],do not prove Wordsworth's capacity to deal with passion. The main reason
3364,WORDSWORTH[1],"for doubting whether, if he had made the attempt, he would have reached"
3365,WORDSWORTH[1],"his highest level, is that, so far as we can see, he did not strongly"
3366,WORDSWORTH[1],feel--perhaps hardly felt at all--that the _passion_ of love is a way
3367,WORDSWORTH[1],into the Infinite; and a thing must be no less than this to Wordsworth
3368,WORDSWORTH[1],"if it is to rouse all his power. Byron, it seemed to him, had"
3369,WORDSWORTH[1],
3370,WORDSWORTH[1],dared to take
3371,WORDSWORTH[1],Life's rule from passion craved for passion's sake;[7]
3372,WORDSWORTH[1],
3373,WORDSWORTH[1],and he utterly repudiated that. 'The immortal mind craves objects that
3374,WORDSWORTH[1],endure.'
3375,WORDSWORTH[1],
3376,WORDSWORTH[1],Then there is that 'romance' which Wordsworth abjured. In using the word
3377,WORDSWORTH[1],I am employing the familiar distinction between two tendencies of the
3378,WORDSWORTH[1],"Romantic Revival, one called naturalistic and one called, in a more"
3379,WORDSWORTH[1],"special sense, romantic, and signalised, among other ways, by a love of"
3380,WORDSWORTH[1],"the marvellous, the supernatural, the exotic, the worlds of mythology."
3381,WORDSWORTH[1],It is a just and necessary distinction: the _Ancient Mariner_ and
3382,WORDSWORTH[1],"_Michael_ are very dissimilar. But, like most distinctions of the kind,"
3383,WORDSWORTH[1],it becomes misleading when it is roughly handled or pushed into an
3384,WORDSWORTH[1],antithesis; and it would be easy to show that these two tendencies
3385,WORDSWORTH[1],"exclude one another only in their inferior examples, and that the better"
3386,WORDSWORTH[1],"the example of either, the more it shows its community with the other."
3387,WORDSWORTH[1],"There is not a great deal of truth to nature in _Lalla Rookh_, but there"
3388,WORDSWORTH[1],is plenty in the _Ancient Mariner_: in certain poems of Crabbe there is
3389,WORDSWORTH[1],"little romance, but there is no want of it in _Sir Eustace Grey_ or in"
3390,WORDSWORTH[1],"_Peter Grimes_. Taking the distinction, however, as we find it, and"
3391,WORDSWORTH[1],"assuming, as I do, that it lay beyond Wordsworth's power to write an"
3392,WORDSWORTH[1],"_Ancient Mariner_, or to tell us of"
3393,WORDSWORTH[1],
3394,WORDSWORTH[1],magic casements opening on the foam
3395,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn,"
3396,WORDSWORTH[1],
3397,WORDSWORTH[1],we are not therefore to conclude that he was by nature deficient in
3398,WORDSWORTH[1],romance and incapable of writing well what he refused to write. The
3399,WORDSWORTH[1],indications are quite contrary. Not to speak here of his own peculiar
3400,WORDSWORTH[1],"dealings with the supernatural, his vehement defence (in the _Prelude_)"
3401,WORDSWORTH[1],of fairy-tales as food for the young is only one of many passages which
3402,WORDSWORTH[1],show that in his youth he lived in a world not haunted only by the
3403,WORDSWORTH[1],supernatural powers of nature. He delighted in 'Arabian fiction.' The
3404,WORDSWORTH[1],'Arabian sands' (_Solitary Reaper_) had the same glamour for him as for
3405,WORDSWORTH[1],"others. His dream of the Arab and the two books (_Prelude_, v.) has a"
3406,WORDSWORTH[1],"very curious romantic effect, though it is not romance _in excelsis_,"
3407,WORDSWORTH[1],"like _Kubla Khan_. His love of Spenser; his very description of him,"
3408,WORDSWORTH[1],
3409,WORDSWORTH[1],"Sweet Spenser, moving through his clouded heaven"
3410,WORDSWORTH[1],With the moon's beauty and the moon's soft pace;
3411,WORDSWORTH[1],
3412,WORDSWORTH[1],"the very lines, so characteristic of his habitual attitude, in which he"
3413,WORDSWORTH[1],praises the Osmunda fern as
3414,WORDSWORTH[1],
3415,WORDSWORTH[1],"lovelier, in its own retired abode"
3416,WORDSWORTH[1],"On Grasmere's beach, than Naiad by the side"
3417,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of Grecian brook, or Lady of the Mere"
3418,WORDSWORTH[1],"Sole-sitting by the shores of old romance,[8]"
3419,WORDSWORTH[1],
3420,WORDSWORTH[1],"--these, and a score of other passages, all point the same way. He would"
3421,WORDSWORTH[1],"not carry his readers to the East, like Southey and Moore and Byron,"
3422,WORDSWORTH[1],"nor, like Coleridge, towards the South Pole; but when it suited his"
3423,WORDSWORTH[1],"purpose, as in _Ruth_, he could write well enough of un-English scenery:"
3424,WORDSWORTH[1],
3425,WORDSWORTH[1],"He told of the magnolia, spread"
3426,WORDSWORTH[1],"High as a cloud, high overhead,"
3427,WORDSWORTH[1],The cypress and her spire;
3428,WORDSWORTH[1],Of flowers that with one scarlet gleam
3429,WORDSWORTH[1],"Cover a hundred leagues, and seem"
3430,WORDSWORTH[1],To set the hills on fire.
3431,WORDSWORTH[1],
3432,WORDSWORTH[1],"He would not choose Endymion or Hyperion for a subject, for he was"
3433,WORDSWORTH[1],determined to speak of what Englishmen may see every day; but what he
3434,WORDSWORTH[1],wrote of Greek religion in the _Excursion_ is full of imagination and
3435,WORDSWORTH[1],"brought inspiration to Keats, and the most famous expression in English"
3436,WORDSWORTH[1],of that longing for the perished glory of Greek myth which appears in
3437,WORDSWORTH[1],much Romantic poetry came from Wordsworth's pen:
3438,WORDSWORTH[1],
3439,WORDSWORTH[1],Great God! I'd rather be
3440,WORDSWORTH[1],A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;
3441,WORDSWORTH[1],"So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,"
3442,WORDSWORTH[1],Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
3443,WORDSWORTH[1],Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;
3444,WORDSWORTH[1],Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.
3445,WORDSWORTH[1],
3446,WORDSWORTH[1],"As for war, Wordsworth neither strongly felt, nor at all approved, that"
3447,WORDSWORTH[1],"elementary love of fighting which, together with much nobler things, is"
3448,WORDSWORTH[1],"gratified by some great poetry. And assuredly he could not, even if he"
3449,WORDSWORTH[1],"would, have rivalled the last canto of _Marmion_, nor even the best"
3450,WORDSWORTH[1],passages in the _Siege of Corinth_. But he is not to be judged by his
3451,WORDSWORTH[1],intentional failures. The martial parts of the _White Doe of Rylstone_
3452,WORDSWORTH[1],"are, with few exceptions, uninteresting, if not painfully tame. The"
3453,WORDSWORTH[1],former at least they were meant to be. The _Lay of the Last Minstrel_
3454,WORDSWORTH[1],was on every tongue. The modest poet was as stiff-necked a person as
3455,WORDSWORTH[1],ever walked the earth; and he was determined that no reader of his poem
3456,WORDSWORTH[1],who missed its spiritual interest should be interested in anything else.
3457,WORDSWORTH[1],Probably he overshot his mark. For readers who could understand him the
3458,WORDSWORTH[1],effect he aimed at would not have been weakened by contrast with an
3459,WORDSWORTH[1],"outward action narrated with more spirit and sympathy. But, however that"
3460,WORDSWORTH[1],"may be, he did what he meant to do. In the _Song at the Feast of"
3461,WORDSWORTH[1],"Brougham Castle_, again, the war-like close of the Song was not written"
3462,WORDSWORTH[1],for its own sake. It was designed with a view to the transition to the
3463,WORDSWORTH[1],"longer metre, the thought of peace in communion with nature, and the"
3464,WORDSWORTH[1],"wonderful stanza 'Love had he found in huts where poor men lie.' But,"
3465,WORDSWORTH[1],"for the effect of this transition, it was necessary for Wordsworth to"
3466,WORDSWORTH[1],put his heart into the martial close of the Song; and surely it has
3467,WORDSWORTH[1],plenty of animation and glory. Its author need not have shrunk from the
3468,WORDSWORTH[1],subject of war if he had wished to handle it _con amore_.
3469,WORDSWORTH[1],
3470,WORDSWORTH[1],The poet whose portrait we drew when we began might have been the author
3471,WORDSWORTH[1],"of the _White Doe_, and perhaps of _Brougham Castle_, and possibly of"
3472,WORDSWORTH[1],the _Happy Warrior_. He could no more have composed the _Poems dedicated
3473,WORDSWORTH[1],to National Independence and Liberty_ than the political sonnets of
3474,WORDSWORTH[1],Milton. And yet Wordsworth wrote nothing more characteristic than these
3475,WORDSWORTH[1],"Poems, which I am not going to praise, since Mr. Swinburne's praise of"
3476,WORDSWORTH[1],"them is, to my mind, not less just than eloquent. They are"
3477,WORDSWORTH[1],"characteristic in many ways. The later are, on the whole, decidedly"
3478,WORDSWORTH[1],"inferior to the earlier. Even in this little series, which occupies the"
3479,WORDSWORTH[1],"first fifteen years of the century, the decline of Wordsworth's poetic"
3480,WORDSWORTH[1],power and the increasing use of theological ideas are clearly visible.
3481,WORDSWORTH[1],"The Odes, again, are much inferior to the majority of the Sonnets. And"
3482,WORDSWORTH[1],this too is characteristic. The entire success of the _Ode to Duty_ is
3483,WORDSWORTH[1],"exceptional, and it is connected with the fact that the poem is written"
3484,WORDSWORTH[1],in regular stanzas of a simple metrical scheme. The irregular Odes are
3485,WORDSWORTH[1],never thus successful. Wordsworth could not command the tone of
3486,WORDSWORTH[1],"sustained rapture, and where his metrical form is irregular his ear is"
3487,WORDSWORTH[1],"uncertain. The Immortality Ode, like _King Lear_, is its author's"
3488,WORDSWORTH[1],"greatest product, but not his best piece of work. The Odes among the"
3489,WORDSWORTH[1],"_Poems_ which we are now considering are declamatory, even violent, and"
3490,WORDSWORTH[1],"yet they stir comparatively little emotion, and they do not sing. The"
3491,WORDSWORTH[1],"sense of massive passion, concentrated, and repressing the utterance it"
3492,WORDSWORTH[1],"permits itself, is that which most moves us in his political verse. And"
3493,WORDSWORTH[1],the Sonnet suited this.
3494,WORDSWORTH[1],
3495,WORDSWORTH[1],The patriotism of these _Poems_ is equally characteristic. It
3496,WORDSWORTH[1],illustrates Wordsworth's total rejection of the Godwinian ideas in which
3497,WORDSWORTH[1],"he had once in vain sought refuge, and his belief in the necessity and"
3498,WORDSWORTH[1],sanctity of forms of association arising from natural kinship. It is
3499,WORDSWORTH[1],"composed, we may say, of two elements. The first is the simple love of"
3500,WORDSWORTH[1],"country raised to a high pitch, the love of 'a lover or a child'; the"
3501,WORDSWORTH[1],love that makes it for some men a miserable doom to be forced to live in
3502,WORDSWORTH[1],"a foreign land, and that makes them feel their country's virtues and"
3503,WORDSWORTH[1],"faults, and joys and sorrows, like those of the persons dearest to them."
3504,WORDSWORTH[1],We talk as if this love were common. It is very far from common; but
3505,WORDSWORTH[1],Wordsworth felt it.[9] The other element in his patriotism I must call
3506,WORDSWORTH[1],"by the dreaded name of 'moral,' a name which Wordsworth did not dread,"
3507,WORDSWORTH[1],because it meant for him nothing stereotyped or narrow. His country is
3508,WORDSWORTH[1],"to him the representative of freedom, left, as he writes in 1803,"
3509,WORDSWORTH[1],
3510,WORDSWORTH[1],the only light
3511,WORDSWORTH[1],Of Liberty that yet remains on earth.
3512,WORDSWORTH[1],
3513,WORDSWORTH[1],"This Liberty is, first, national independence; and that requires"
3514,WORDSWORTH[1],"military power, the maintenance of which is a primary moral duty.[10]"
3515,WORDSWORTH[1],But neither military power nor even national independence is of value in
3516,WORDSWORTH[1],itself; and neither could be long maintained without that which gives
3517,WORDSWORTH[1],"value to both. This is the freedom of the soul, plain living and high"
3518,WORDSWORTH[1],"thinking, indifference to the externals of mere rank or wealth or power,"
3519,WORDSWORTH[1],domestic affections not crippled (as they may be) by poverty. Wordsworth
3520,WORDSWORTH[1],fears for his country only when he doubts whether this inward freedom is
3521,WORDSWORTH[1],"not failing;[11] but he seldom fears for long. England, in the war"
3522,WORDSWORTH[1],"against Napoleon, is to him almost what the England of the Long"
3523,WORDSWORTH[1],"Parliament and the Commonwealth was to Milton,--an elect people, the"
3524,WORDSWORTH[1],"chosen agent of God's purpose on the earth. His ideal of life, unlike"
3525,WORDSWORTH[1],Milton's in the stress he lays on the domestic affections and the
3526,WORDSWORTH[1],"influence of nature, is otherwise of the same Stoical cast. His country"
3527,WORDSWORTH[1],"is to him, as to Milton,"
3528,WORDSWORTH[1],
3529,WORDSWORTH[1],"An old and haughty nation, proud in arms.[12]"
3530,WORDSWORTH[1],
3531,WORDSWORTH[1],"And his own pride in it is, like Milton's, in the highest degree"
3532,WORDSWORTH[1],haughty. It would be calumnious to say that it recalls the description
3533,WORDSWORTH[1],"of the English given by the Irishman Goldsmith,"
3534,WORDSWORTH[1],
3535,WORDSWORTH[1],"Pride in their port, defiance in their eye,"
3536,WORDSWORTH[1],I see the lords of human kind pass by;
3537,WORDSWORTH[1],
3538,WORDSWORTH[1],for Wordsworth had not the faintest wish to see his countrymen the lords
3539,WORDSWORTH[1],"of human kind, nor is there anything vulgar in his patriotism; but there"
3540,WORDSWORTH[1],"_is_ pride in his port and defiance in his eye. And, lastly, the"
3541,WORDSWORTH[1],"character of his ideal and of this national pride, with him as with"
3542,WORDSWORTH[1],"Milton, is connected with personal traits,--impatience of constraint,"
3543,WORDSWORTH[1],"severity, a certain austere passion, an inclination of imagination to"
3544,WORDSWORTH[1],the sublime.
3545,WORDSWORTH[1],
3546,WORDSWORTH[1],
3547,WORDSWORTH[1],3.
3548,WORDSWORTH[1],
3549,WORDSWORTH[1],"These personal traits, though quite compatible with the portrait on"
3550,WORDSWORTH[1],"which I am commenting, are not visible in it. Nor are others, which"
3551,WORDSWORTH[1],"belong especially, but not exclusively, to the younger Wordsworth. He"
3552,WORDSWORTH[1],had a spirit so vehement and affections so violent (it is his sister's
3553,WORDSWORTH[1],word) as to inspire alarm for him. If he had been acquainted with that
3554,WORDSWORTH[1],"excuse for impotent idleness and selfishness, 'the artistic"
3555,WORDSWORTH[1],"temperament,' he might have made out a good claim to it. He was from the"
3556,WORDSWORTH[1],"beginning self-willed, and for a long time he appeared aimless. He would"
3557,WORDSWORTH[1],not work at the studies of his university: he preferred to imagine a
3558,WORDSWORTH[1],university in which he _would_ work. He had a passion for wandering
3559,WORDSWORTH[1],"which was restrained only by want of means, and which opened his heart"
3560,WORDSWORTH[1],to every pedlar or tramp whom he met. After leaving Cambridge he would
3561,WORDSWORTH[1],"not fix on a profession. He remained, to the displeasure of his"
3562,WORDSWORTH[1],"relatives, an idler in the land or out of it; and as soon as he had £900"
3563,WORDSWORTH[1],of capital left to him he determined _not_ to have a profession.
3564,WORDSWORTH[1],"Sometimes he worked hard at his poetry, even heroically hard; but he did"
3565,WORDSWORTH[1],"not work methodically, and often he wrote nothing for weeks, but loafed"
3566,WORDSWORTH[1],"and walked and enjoyed himself. He was not blind like Milton, but the"
3567,WORDSWORTH[1],"act of writing was physically disagreeable to him, and he made his"
3568,WORDSWORTH[1],"woman-kind write to his dictation. He would not conform to rules, or"
3569,WORDSWORTH[1],"attend to the dinner-bell, or go to church (he made up for this neglect"
3570,WORDSWORTH[1],"later). 'He wrote his _Ode to Duty_,' said one of his friends, 'and then"
3571,WORDSWORTH[1],he had done with that matter.' He never 'tired' of his 'unchartered
3572,WORDSWORTH[1],"freedom.' In age, if he wanted to go out, whatever the hour and whatever"
3573,WORDSWORTH[1],"the weather, he must have his way. 'In vain one reminded him that a"
3574,WORDSWORTH[1],letter needed an answer or that the storm would soon be over. It was
3575,WORDSWORTH[1],very necessary for him to do what he liked.' If the poetic fit was on
3576,WORDSWORTH[1],him he could attend to nothing else. He was passionately fond of his
3577,WORDSWORTH[1],"children, but, when the serious illness of one of them coincided with an"
3578,WORDSWORTH[1],"onset of inspiration, it was impossible to rouse him to a sense of"
3579,WORDSWORTH[1],danger. At such times he was as completely possessed as any wild poet
3580,WORDSWORTH[1],who ruins the happiness of everyone dependent on him. But he has himself
3581,WORDSWORTH[1],"described the tyranny of inspiration, and the reaction after it, in his"
3582,WORDSWORTH[1],_Stanzas written in Thomson's Castle of Indolence_. It is almost beyond
3583,WORDSWORTH[1],"doubt, I think, that the first portrait there is that of himself; and"
3584,WORDSWORTH[1],though it is idealised it is probably quite as accurate as the portrait
3585,WORDSWORTH[1],"in _A Poet's Epitaph_. In the _Prelude_ he tells us that, though he"
3586,WORDSWORTH[1],rarely at Cambridge betrayed by gestures or looks his feelings about
3587,WORDSWORTH[1],"nature, yet, when he did so, some of his companions said he was mad."
3588,WORDSWORTH[1],"Hazlitt, describing his manner of reading his own poetry in much later"
3589,WORDSWORTH[1],"years, says, 'It is clear that he is either mad or inspired.'"
3590,WORDSWORTH[1],
3591,WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth's lawlessness was of the innocuous kind, but it is a"
3592,WORDSWORTH[1],superstition to suppose that he was a disgustingly well-regulated
3593,WORDSWORTH[1],person. It is scarcely less unjust to describe his poetic sympathies as
3594,WORDSWORTH[1],"narrow and his poetic morality as puritanical. The former, of course,"
3595,WORDSWORTH[1],"had nothing like the range of minds like Chaucer, or Shakespeare, or"
3596,WORDSWORTH[1],"Browning, or the great novelists. Wordsworth's want of humour would by"
3597,WORDSWORTH[1],"itself have made that impossible; and, in addition, though by no means"
3598,WORDSWORTH[1],"wanting in psychological curiosity, he was not much interested in"
3599,WORDSWORTH[1],"complex natures. Simple souls, and especially simple souls that are also"
3600,WORDSWORTH[1],"deep, were the natures that attracted him: and in the same way the"
3601,WORDSWORTH[1],passions he loved to depict are not those that storm themselves out or
3602,WORDSWORTH[1],"rush to a catastrophe, but those that hold the soul in a vice for long"
3603,WORDSWORTH[1],"years. But, these limitations admitted, it will not be found by anyone"
3604,WORDSWORTH[1],who reviews the characters in the smaller poems and the _Excursion_
3605,WORDSWORTH[1],"(especially Book vii.), that Wordsworth's poetic sympathies are narrow."
3606,WORDSWORTH[1],They are wider than those of any imaginative writer of his time and
3607,WORDSWORTH[1],country except Scott and perhaps Crabbe.
3608,WORDSWORTH[1],
3609,WORDSWORTH[1],"Nor is his morality narrow. It is serious, but it is human and kindly"
3610,WORDSWORTH[1],"and not in the least ascetic. 'It is the privilege of poetic genius,' he"
3611,WORDSWORTH[1],"says in his defence of Burns, 'to catch a spirit of pleasure wherever it"
3612,WORDSWORTH[1],can be found--in the walks of nature and in the business of men. The
3613,WORDSWORTH[1],"poet, trusting to primary instincts, luxuriates among the felicities of"
3614,WORDSWORTH[1],"love and wine, and is enraptured while he describes the fairer aspects"
3615,WORDSWORTH[1],of war: nor does he shrink from the company of the passion of love
3616,WORDSWORTH[1],though immoderate--from convivial pleasure though intemperate--nor from
3617,WORDSWORTH[1],the presence of war though savage and recognised as the handmaid of
3618,WORDSWORTH[1],desolation. Who but some impenetrable dunce or narrow-minded puritan in
3619,WORDSWORTH[1],works of art ever read without delight the picture which Burns has drawn
3620,WORDSWORTH[1],of the convivial exaltation of the rustic adventurer Tam o' Shanter?'
3621,WORDSWORTH[1],There is no want of sympathy in Wordsworth's own picture of the
3622,WORDSWORTH[1],'convivial exaltation' of his Waggoner. It is true that he himself never
3623,WORDSWORTH[1],"describes a scene in which, to quote his astonishing phrase, 'conjugal"
3624,WORDSWORTH[1],"fidelity archly bends to the service of general benevolence,' and that"
3625,WORDSWORTH[1],"his treatment of sexual passion is always grave and, in a true sense,"
3626,WORDSWORTH[1],moral; but it is plain and manly and perfectly free from timidity or
3627,WORDSWORTH[1],monkishness. It would really be easier to make out against Wordsworth a
3628,WORDSWORTH[1],charge of excessive tolerance than a charge of excessive rigidity. A
3629,WORDSWORTH[1],beggar is the sort of person he likes. It is all very well for him to
3630,WORDSWORTH[1],"say that he likes the Old Cumberland Beggar because, by making people"
3631,WORDSWORTH[1],"give, he keeps love alive in their hearts. It may be so--he says so, and"
3632,WORDSWORTH[1],I always believe him. But that was not his only reason; and it is clear
3633,WORDSWORTH[1],"to me that, when he met the tall gipsy-beggar, he gave her money because"
3634,WORDSWORTH[1],"she was beautiful and queenly, and that he delighted in her two lying"
3635,WORDSWORTH[1],boys because of their gaiety and joy in life. Neither has he the least
3636,WORDSWORTH[1],objection to a thief. The grandfather and grandson who go pilfering
3637,WORDSWORTH[1],"together, two infants separated by ninety years, meet with nothing but"
3638,WORDSWORTH[1],"smiles from him. The Farmer of Tilsbury Vale, after thirty years of"
3639,WORDSWORTH[1],"careless hospitality, found himself ruined. He borrowed money, spent"
3640,WORDSWORTH[1],"some of it in paying a few of his other debts, and absconded to London."
3641,WORDSWORTH[1],
3642,WORDSWORTH[1],But this he did all in the _ease_ of his heart.
3643,WORDSWORTH[1],
3644,WORDSWORTH[1],"And for this reason, and because in London he keeps the ease of his"
3645,WORDSWORTH[1],"heart and continues to love the country, Wordsworth dismisses him with a"
3646,WORDSWORTH[1],blessing. What he cannot bear is torpor. He passes a knot of gipsies in
3647,WORDSWORTH[1],"the morning; and, passing them again after his twelve hours of joyful"
3648,WORDSWORTH[1],"rambling, he finds them just as they were, sunk in sloth; and he breaks"
3649,WORDSWORTH[1],"out,"
3650,WORDSWORTH[1],
3651,WORDSWORTH[1],"Oh, better wrong and strife,"
3652,WORDSWORTH[1],Better vain deeds and evil than such life.
3653,WORDSWORTH[1],
3654,WORDSWORTH[1],"He changed this shocking exclamation later, but it represents his"
3655,WORDSWORTH[1],"original feeling, and he might have trusted that only an 'impenetrable"
3656,WORDSWORTH[1],dunce or narrow-minded puritan' would misunderstand him.[13]
3657,WORDSWORTH[1],
3658,WORDSWORTH[1],Wordsworth's morality is of one piece with his optimism and with his
3659,WORDSWORTH[1],determination to seize and exhibit in everything the element of good.
3660,WORDSWORTH[1],"But this is a subject far too large for treatment here, and I can refer"
3661,WORDSWORTH[1],to it only in the most summary way. What Arnold precisely meant when he
3662,WORDSWORTH[1],said that Wordsworth 'put by' the cloud of human destiny I am not sure.
3663,WORDSWORTH[1],That Wordsworth saw this cloud and looked at it steadily is beyond all
3664,WORDSWORTH[1],question. I am not building on such famous lines as
3665,WORDSWORTH[1],
3666,WORDSWORTH[1],"The still sad music of humanity,"
3667,WORDSWORTH[1],
3668,WORDSWORTH[1],or
3669,WORDSWORTH[1],
3670,WORDSWORTH[1],the fierce confederate storm
3671,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of Sorrow, barricadoed evermore"
3672,WORDSWORTH[1],Within the walls of cities;
3673,WORDSWORTH[1],
3674,WORDSWORTH[1],or
3675,WORDSWORTH[1],
3676,WORDSWORTH[1],"Amid the groves, under the shadowy hills,"
3677,WORDSWORTH[1],"The generations are prepared; the pangs,"
3678,WORDSWORTH[1],"The internal pangs, are ready; the dread strife"
3679,WORDSWORTH[1],Of poor humanity's afflicted will
3680,WORDSWORTH[1],Struggling in vain with ruthless destiny;
3681,WORDSWORTH[1],
3682,WORDSWORTH[1],"for, although such quotations could be multiplied, isolated expressions,"
3683,WORDSWORTH[1],"even when not dramatic,[14] would prove little. But I repeat the remark"
3684,WORDSWORTH[1],"already made, that if we review the subjects of many of Wordsworth's"
3685,WORDSWORTH[1],"famous poems on human life,--the subjects, for example, of _The Thorn_,"
3686,WORDSWORTH[1],"_The Sailor's Mother_, _Ruth_, _The Brothers_, _Michael_, _The"
3687,WORDSWORTH[1],"Affliction of Margaret_, _The White Doe of Rylstone_, the story of"
3688,WORDSWORTH[1],"Margaret in _Excursion_, i., half the stories told in _Excursion_, vi."
3689,WORDSWORTH[1],"and vii.--we find ourselves in the presence of poverty, crime, insanity,"
3690,WORDSWORTH[1],"ruined innocence, torturing hopes doomed to extinction, solitary"
3691,WORDSWORTH[1],"anguish, even despair. Ignore the manner in which Wordsworth treated"
3692,WORDSWORTH[1],"his subjects, and you will have to say that his world, so far as"
3693,WORDSWORTH[1],"humanity is concerned, is a dark world,--at least as dark as that of"
3694,WORDSWORTH[1],"Byron. Unquestionably then he saw the cloud of human destiny, and he did"
3695,WORDSWORTH[1],not avert his eyes from it. Nor did he pretend to understand its
3696,WORDSWORTH[1],"darkness. The world was to him in the end 'this unintelligible world,'"
3697,WORDSWORTH[1],and the only 'adequate support for the calamities of mortal life' was
3698,WORDSWORTH[1],"faith.[15] But he was profoundly impressed, through the experience of"
3699,WORDSWORTH[1],"his own years of crisis, alike by the dangers of despondency, and by the"
3700,WORDSWORTH[1],superficiality of the views which it engenders. It was for him (and
3701,WORDSWORTH[1],"here, as in other points, he shows his natural affinity to Spinoza) a"
3702,WORDSWORTH[1],"condition in which the soul, concentrated on its own suffering, for that"
3703,WORDSWORTH[1],very reason loses hold both of its own being and of the reality of which
3704,WORDSWORTH[1],it forms a part. His experience also made it impossible for him to doubt
3705,WORDSWORTH[1],that what he grasped
3706,WORDSWORTH[1],
3707,WORDSWORTH[1],At times when most existence with herself
3708,WORDSWORTH[1],"Is satisfied,"
3709,WORDSWORTH[1],
3710,WORDSWORTH[1],--and these are the times when existence is most united in love with
3711,WORDSWORTH[1],"other existence--was, in a special sense or degree, the truth, and"
3712,WORDSWORTH[1],"therefore that the evils which we suffer, deplore, or condemn, cannot"
3713,WORDSWORTH[1],"really be what they seem to us when we merely suffer, deplore, or"
3714,WORDSWORTH[1],"condemn them. He set himself to _see_ this, as far as he could, and to"
3715,WORDSWORTH[1],"show it. He sang of pleasure, joy, glee, blitheness, love, wherever in"
3716,WORDSWORTH[1],nature or humanity they assert their indisputable power; and turning to
3717,WORDSWORTH[1],"pain and wrong, and gazing at them steadfastly, and setting himself to"
3718,WORDSWORTH[1],"present the facts with a quiet but unsparing truthfulness, he yet"
3719,WORDSWORTH[1],"endeavoured to show what he had seen, that sometimes pain and wrong are"
3720,WORDSWORTH[1],the conditions of a happiness and good which without them could not
3721,WORDSWORTH[1],"have been, that no limit can be set to the power of the soul to"
3722,WORDSWORTH[1],"transmute them into its own substance, and that, in suffering and even"
3723,WORDSWORTH[1],"in misery, there may still be such a strength as fills us with awe or"
3724,WORDSWORTH[1],"with glory. He did not pretend, I repeat, that what he saw sufficed to"
3725,WORDSWORTH[1],solve the riddle of the painful earth. 'Our being rests' on 'dark
3726,WORDSWORTH[1],"foundations,' and 'our haughty life is crowned with darkness.' But still"
3727,WORDSWORTH[1],"what he showed was what he _saw_, and he saw it in the cloud of human"
3728,WORDSWORTH[1],destiny. We are not here concerned with his faith in the sun behind that
3729,WORDSWORTH[1],cloud; my purpose is only to insist that he 'fronted' it 'fearlessly.'
3730,WORDSWORTH[1],
3731,WORDSWORTH[1],
3732,WORDSWORTH[1],4.
3733,WORDSWORTH[1],
3734,WORDSWORTH[1],"After quoting the lines from _A Poet's Epitaph_, and Arnold's lines on"
3735,WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth, I asked how the man described in them ever came to write the"
3736,WORDSWORTH[1],"_Ode_ on Immortality, or _Yew-trees_, or why he should say,"
3737,WORDSWORTH[1],
3738,WORDSWORTH[1],"For I must tread on shadowy ground, must sink"
3739,WORDSWORTH[1],"Deep--and, aloft ascending, breathe in worlds"
3740,WORDSWORTH[1],To which the heaven of heavens is but a veil.
3741,WORDSWORTH[1],
3742,WORDSWORTH[1],The aspect of Wordsworth's poetry which answers this question forms my
3743,WORDSWORTH[1],last subject.
3744,WORDSWORTH[1],
3745,WORDSWORTH[1],"We may recall this aspect in more than one way. First, not a little of"
3746,WORDSWORTH[1],Wordsworth's poetry either approaches or actually enters the province of
3747,WORDSWORTH[1],the sublime. His strongest natural inclination tended there. He himself
3748,WORDSWORTH[1],"speaks of his temperament as 'stern,' and tells us that"
3749,WORDSWORTH[1],
3750,WORDSWORTH[1],to the very going out of youth
3751,WORDSWORTH[1],"[He] too exclusively esteemed _that_ love,"
3752,WORDSWORTH[1],"And sought _that_ beauty, which, as Milton says,"
3753,WORDSWORTH[1],Hath terror in it.
3754,WORDSWORTH[1],
3755,WORDSWORTH[1],This disposition is easily traced in the imaginative impressions of his
3756,WORDSWORTH[1],childhood as he describes them in the _Prelude_. His fixed habit of
3757,WORDSWORTH[1],looking
3758,WORDSWORTH[1],
3759,WORDSWORTH[1],with feelings of fraternal love
3760,WORDSWORTH[1],Upon the unassuming things that hold
3761,WORDSWORTH[1],"A silent station in this beauteous world,"
3762,WORDSWORTH[1],
3763,WORDSWORTH[1],"was only formed, it would seem, under his sister's influence, after his"
3764,WORDSWORTH[1],recovery from the crisis that followed the ruin of his towering hopes in
3765,WORDSWORTH[1],the French Revolution. It was a part of his endeavour to find something
3766,WORDSWORTH[1],of the distant ideal in life's familiar face. And though this attitude
3767,WORDSWORTH[1],"of sympathy and humility did become habitual, the first bent towards"
3768,WORDSWORTH[1],"grandeur, austerity, sublimity, retained its force. It is evident in the"
3769,WORDSWORTH[1],"political poems, and in all those pictures of life which depict the"
3770,WORDSWORTH[1],"unconquerable power of affection, passion, resolution, patience, or"
3771,WORDSWORTH[1],faith. It inspires much of his greatest poetry of Nature. It emerges
3772,WORDSWORTH[1],"occasionally with a strange and thrilling effect in the serene,"
3773,WORDSWORTH[1],"gracious, but sometimes stagnant atmosphere of the later poems,--for the"
3774,WORDSWORTH[1],"last time, perhaps, in that magnificent stanza of the _Extempore"
3775,WORDSWORTH[1],"Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg_ (1835),"
3776,WORDSWORTH[1],
3777,WORDSWORTH[1],"Like clouds that rake the mountain-summits,"
3778,WORDSWORTH[1],"Or waves that own no curbing hand,"
3779,WORDSWORTH[1],How fast has brother followed brother
3780,WORDSWORTH[1],From sunshine to the sunless land!
3781,WORDSWORTH[1],
3782,WORDSWORTH[1],Wordsworth is indisputably the most sublime of our poets since Milton.
3783,WORDSWORTH[1],
3784,WORDSWORTH[1],"We may put the matter, secondly, thus. However much Wordsworth was the"
3785,WORDSWORTH[1],"poet of small and humble things, and the poet who saw his ideal"
3786,WORDSWORTH[1],"realised, not in Utopia, but here and now before his eyes, he was, quite"
3787,WORDSWORTH[1],"as much, what some would call a mystic. He saw everything in the light"
3788,WORDSWORTH[1],"of 'the visionary power.' He was, for himself,"
3789,WORDSWORTH[1],
3790,WORDSWORTH[1],The transitory being that beheld
3791,WORDSWORTH[1],This Vision.
3792,WORDSWORTH[1],
3793,WORDSWORTH[1],"He apprehended all things, natural or human, as the expression of"
3794,WORDSWORTH[1],"something which, while manifested in them, immeasurably transcends them."
3795,WORDSWORTH[1],And nothing can be more intensely Wordsworthian than the poems and
3796,WORDSWORTH[1],passages most marked by this visionary power and most directly issuing
3797,WORDSWORTH[1],from this apprehension. The bearing of these statements on Wordsworth's
3798,WORDSWORTH[1],inclination to sublimity will be obvious at a glance.
3799,WORDSWORTH[1],
3800,WORDSWORTH[1],Now we may prefer the Wordsworth of the daffodils to the Wordsworth of
3801,WORDSWORTH[1],"the yew-trees, and we may even believe the poet's mysticism to be"
3802,WORDSWORTH[1],moonshine; but it is certain that to neglect or throw into the shade
3803,WORDSWORTH[1],this aspect of his poetry is neither to take Wordsworth as he really was
3804,WORDSWORTH[1],"nor to judge his poetry truly, since this aspect appears in much of it"
3805,WORDSWORTH[1],"that we cannot deny to be first-rate. Yet there is, I think, and has"
3806,WORDSWORTH[1],"been for some time, a tendency to this mistake. It is exemplified in"
3807,WORDSWORTH[1],"Arnold's Introduction and has been increased by it, and it is visible in"
3808,WORDSWORTH[1],some degree even in Pater's essay. Arnold wished to make Wordsworth more
3809,WORDSWORTH[1],popular; and so he was tempted to represent Wordsworth's poetry as much
3810,WORDSWORTH[1],"more simple and unambitious than it really was, and as much more easily"
3811,WORDSWORTH[1],apprehended than it ever can be. He was also annoyed by attempts to
3812,WORDSWORTH[1],"formulate a systematic Wordsworthian philosophy; partly, doubtless,"
3813,WORDSWORTH[1],"because he knew that, however great the philosophical value of a poet's"
3814,WORDSWORTH[1],"ideas may be, it cannot by itself determine the value of his poetry; but"
3815,WORDSWORTH[1],"partly also because, having himself but little turn for philosophy, he"
3816,WORDSWORTH[1],"was disposed to regard it as illusory; and further because, even in the"
3817,WORDSWORTH[1],"poetic sphere, he was somewhat deficient in that kind of imagination"
3818,WORDSWORTH[1],which is allied to metaphysical thought. This is one reason of his
3819,WORDSWORTH[1],"curious failure to appreciate Shelley, and of the evident irritation"
3820,WORDSWORTH[1],"which Shelley produced in him. And it is also one reason why, both in"
3821,WORDSWORTH[1],his _Memorial Verses_ and in the introduction to his selection from
3822,WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth, he either ignores or depreciates that aspect of the poetry"
3823,WORDSWORTH[1],"with which we are just now concerned. It is not true, we must bluntly"
3824,WORDSWORTH[1],"say, that the cause of the greatness of this poetry 'is simple and may"
3825,WORDSWORTH[1],"be told quite simply.' It is true, and it is admirably said, that this"
3826,WORDSWORTH[1],poetry 'is great because of the extraordinary power with which
3827,WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth feels the joy offered to us in nature, the joy offered to us"
3828,WORDSWORTH[1],in the simple primary affections and duties.' But this is only half the
3829,WORDSWORTH[1],truth.
3830,WORDSWORTH[1],
3831,WORDSWORTH[1],"Pater's essay is not thus one-sided. It is, to my mind, an extremely"
3832,WORDSWORTH[1],fine piece of criticism. Yet the tendency to which I am objecting does
3833,WORDSWORTH[1],"appear in it. Pater says, for example, that Wordsworth is the poet of"
3834,WORDSWORTH[1],"nature, 'and of nature, after all, in her modesty. The English Lake"
3835,WORDSWORTH[1],"country has, of course, its grandeurs. But the peculiar function of"
3836,WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth's genius, as carrying in it a power to open out the soul of"
3837,WORDSWORTH[1],"apparently little and familiar things, would have found its true test"
3838,WORDSWORTH[1],"had he become the poet of Surrey, say! and the prophet of its life.'"
3839,WORDSWORTH[1],"This last sentence is, in one sense, doubtless true. The 'function'"
3840,WORDSWORTH[1],"referred to could have been exercised in Surrey, and was exercised in"
3841,WORDSWORTH[1],"Dorset and Somerset, as well as in the Lake country. And this function"
3842,WORDSWORTH[1],was a 'peculiar function of Wordsworth's genius.' But that it was _the_
3843,WORDSWORTH[1],"peculiar function of his genius, or more peculiar than that other"
3844,WORDSWORTH[1],"function which forms our present subject, I venture to deny; and for the"
3845,WORDSWORTH[1],"full exercise of this latter function, it is hardly hazardous to assert,"
3846,WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth's childhood in a mountain district, and his subsequent"
3847,WORDSWORTH[1],"residence there, were indispensable. This will be doubted for a moment,"
3848,WORDSWORTH[1],"I believe, only by those readers (and they are not a few) who ignore the"
3849,WORDSWORTH[1],"_Prelude_ and the _Excursion_. But the _Prelude_ and the _Excursion_,"
3850,WORDSWORTH[1],"though there are dull pages in both, contain much of Wordsworth's best"
3851,WORDSWORTH[1],"and most characteristic poetry. And even in a selection like Arnold's,"
3852,WORDSWORTH[1],"which, perhaps wisely, makes hardly any use of them, many famous poems"
3853,WORDSWORTH[1],will be found which deal with nature but not with nature 'in her
3854,WORDSWORTH[1],modesty.'
3855,WORDSWORTH[1],
3856,WORDSWORTH[1],"My main object was to insist that the 'mystic,' 'visionary,' 'sublime,'"
3857,WORDSWORTH[1],aspect of Wordsworth's poetry must not be slighted. I wish to add a few
3858,WORDSWORTH[1],"remarks on it, but to consider it fully would carry us far beyond our"
3859,WORDSWORTH[1],"bounds; and, even if I attempted the task, I should not formulate its"
3860,WORDSWORTH[1],"results in a body of doctrines. Such a formulation is useful, and I see"
3861,WORDSWORTH[1],"no objection to it in principle, as one method of exploring Wordsworth's"
3862,WORDSWORTH[1],mind with a view to the better apprehension of his poetry. But the
3863,WORDSWORTH[1],"method has its dangers, and it is another matter to put forward the"
3864,WORDSWORTH[1],"results as philosophically adequate, or to take the position that"
3865,WORDSWORTH[1],"'Wordsworth was first and foremost a philosophical thinker, a man whose"
3866,WORDSWORTH[1],"intention and purpose it was to think out for himself, faithfully and"
3867,WORDSWORTH[1],"seriously, the questions concerning man and nature and human life' (Dean"
3868,WORDSWORTH[1],"Church). If this were true, he should have given himself to philosophy"
3869,WORDSWORTH[1],and not to poetry; and there is no reason to think that he would have
3870,WORDSWORTH[1],been eminently successful. Nobody ever was so who was not forced by a
3871,WORDSWORTH[1],special natural power and an imperious impulsion into the business of
3872,WORDSWORTH[1],"'thinking out,' and who did not develope this power by years of arduous"
3873,WORDSWORTH[1],"discipline. Wordsworth does not show it in any marked degree; and,"
3874,WORDSWORTH[1],"though he reflected deeply and acutely, he was without philosophical"
3875,WORDSWORTH[1],training. His poetry is immensely interesting as an imaginative
3876,WORDSWORTH[1],"expression of the same mind which, in his day, produced in Germany great"
3877,WORDSWORTH[1],"philosophies. His poetic experience, his intuitions, his single"
3878,WORDSWORTH[1],"thoughts, even his large views, correspond in a striking way, sometimes"
3879,WORDSWORTH[1],"in a startling way, with ideas methodically developed by Kant,"
3880,WORDSWORTH[1],"Schelling, Hegel, Schopenhauer. They remain admirable material for"
3881,WORDSWORTH[1],philosophy; and a philosophy which found itself driven to treat them as
3882,WORDSWORTH[1],moonshine would probably be a very poor affair. But they are like the
3883,WORDSWORTH[1],experience and the utterances of men of religious genius: great truths
3884,WORDSWORTH[1],"are enshrined in them, but generally the shrine would have to be broken"
3885,WORDSWORTH[1],to liberate these truths in a form which would satisfy the desire to
3886,WORDSWORTH[1],understand. To claim for them the power to satisfy that desire is an
3887,WORDSWORTH[1],"error, and it tempts those in whom that desire is predominant to treat"
3888,WORDSWORTH[1],them as mere beautiful illusions.
3889,WORDSWORTH[1],
3890,WORDSWORTH[1],"Setting aside, then, any questions as to the ultimate import of the"
3891,WORDSWORTH[1],"'mystic' strain in Wordsworth's poetry, I intend only to call attention"
3892,WORDSWORTH[1],to certain traits in the kind of poetic experience which exhibits it
3893,WORDSWORTH[1],most plainly. And we may observe at once that in this there is always
3894,WORDSWORTH[1],traceable a certain hostility to 'sense.' I do not mean that hostility
3895,WORDSWORTH[1],"which is present in _all_ poetic experience, and of which Wordsworth was"
3896,WORDSWORTH[1],very distinctly aware. The regular action of the senses on their
3897,WORDSWORTH[1],"customary material produces, in his view, a 'tyranny' over the soul. It"
3898,WORDSWORTH[1],"helps to construct that every-day picture of the world, of sensible"
3899,WORDSWORTH[1],"objects and events 'in disconnection dead and spiritless,' which we take"
3900,WORDSWORTH[1],for reality. In relation to this reality we become passive slaves;[16]
3901,WORDSWORTH[1],it lies on us with a weight 'heavy as frost and deep almost as life.' It
3902,WORDSWORTH[1],is the origin alike of our torpor and our superficiality. _All_ poetic
3903,WORDSWORTH[1],"experience frees us from it to some extent, or breaks into it, and so"
3904,WORDSWORTH[1],"may be called hostile to sense. But this experience is, broadly"
3905,WORDSWORTH[1],"speaking, of two different kinds. The perception of the daffodils as"
3906,WORDSWORTH[1],"dancing in glee, and in sympathy with other gleeful beings, shows us a"
3907,WORDSWORTH[1],"living, joyous, loving world, and so a 'spiritual' world, not a merely"
3908,WORDSWORTH[1],'sensible' one. But the hostility to sense is here no more than a
3909,WORDSWORTH[1],hostility to _mere_ sense: this 'spiritual' world is itself the sensible
3910,WORDSWORTH[1],world more fully apprehended: the daffodils do not change or lose their
3911,WORDSWORTH[1],"colour in disclosing their glee. On the other hand, in the kind of"
3912,WORDSWORTH[1],"experience which forms our present subject, there is always some feeling"
3913,WORDSWORTH[1],of definite contrast with the limited sensible world. The arresting
3914,WORDSWORTH[1],"feature or object is felt in some way _against_ this background, or even"
3915,WORDSWORTH[1],as in some way a denial of it. Sometimes it is a visionary unearthly
3916,WORDSWORTH[1],light resting on a scene or on some strange figure. Sometimes it is the
3917,WORDSWORTH[1],feeling that the scene or figure belongs to the world of dream.
3918,WORDSWORTH[1],"Sometimes it is an intimation of boundlessness, contradicting or"
3919,WORDSWORTH[1],abolishing the fixed limits of our habitual view. Sometimes it is the
3920,WORDSWORTH[1],"obscure sense of 'unknown modes of being,' unlike the familiar modes."
3921,WORDSWORTH[1],"This kind of experience, further, comes often with a distinct shock,"
3922,WORDSWORTH[1],"which may bewilder, confuse or trouble the mind. And, lastly, it is"
3923,WORDSWORTH[1],"especially, though not invariably, associated with mountains, and again"
3924,WORDSWORTH[1],"with solitude. Some of these bald statements I will go on to illustrate,"
3925,WORDSWORTH[1],"only remarking that the boundary between these modes of imagination is,"
3926,WORDSWORTH[1],"naturally, less marked and more wavering in Wordsworth's poetry than in"
3927,WORDSWORTH[1],my brief analysis.
3928,WORDSWORTH[1],
3929,WORDSWORTH[1],"We may begin with a poem standing near this boundary, the famous verses"
3930,WORDSWORTH[1],"_To the Cuckoo_, 'O blithe new-comer.' It stands near the boundary"
3931,WORDSWORTH[1],"because, like the poem on the Daffodils, it is entirely happy. But it"
3932,WORDSWORTH[1],"stands unmistakably on the further side of the boundary, and is, in"
3933,WORDSWORTH[1],"truth, more nearly allied to the _Ode_ on Immortality than to the poem"
3934,WORDSWORTH[1],"on the Daffodils. The sense of sight is baffled, and its tyranny broken."
3935,WORDSWORTH[1],"Only a cry is heard, which makes the listener look a thousand ways, so"
3936,WORDSWORTH[1],shifting is the direction from which it reaches him. It seems to come
3937,WORDSWORTH[1],"from a mere 'voice,' 'an invisible thing,' 'a mystery.' It brings him"
3938,WORDSWORTH[1],"'a tale of visionary hours,'--hours of childhood, when he sought this"
3939,WORDSWORTH[1],"invisible thing in vain, and the earth appeared to his bewildered but"
3940,WORDSWORTH[1],"liberated fancy 'an unsubstantial fairy place.' And still, when he hears"
3941,WORDSWORTH[1],"it, the great globe itself, we may say, fades like an unsubstantial"
3942,WORDSWORTH[1],"pageant; or, to quote from the Immortality _Ode_, the 'shades of the"
3943,WORDSWORTH[1],prison house' melt into air. These words are much more solemn than the
3944,WORDSWORTH[1],"Cuckoo poem; but the experience is of the same type, and 'the visionary"
3945,WORDSWORTH[1],"gleam' of the ode, like the 'wandering voice' of the poem, is the"
3946,WORDSWORTH[1],expression through sense of something beyond sense.
3947,WORDSWORTH[1],
3948,WORDSWORTH[1],"Take another passage referring to childhood. It is from the _Prelude_,"
3949,WORDSWORTH[1],"ii. Here there is something more than perplexity. There is apprehension,"
3950,WORDSWORTH[1],and we are approaching the sublime:
3951,WORDSWORTH[1],
3952,WORDSWORTH[1],One summer evening (led by her[17]) I found
3953,WORDSWORTH[1],A little boat tied to a willow tree
3954,WORDSWORTH[1],"Within a rocky cave, its usual home."
3955,WORDSWORTH[1],"Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in"
3956,WORDSWORTH[1],Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth
3957,WORDSWORTH[1],"And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice"
3958,WORDSWORTH[1],Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;
3959,WORDSWORTH[1],"Leaving behind her still, on either side,"
3960,WORDSWORTH[1],"Small circles glittering idly in the moon,"
3961,WORDSWORTH[1],Until they melted all into one track
3962,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,"
3963,WORDSWORTH[1],"Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point"
3964,WORDSWORTH[1],"With an unswerving line, I fixed my view"
3965,WORDSWORTH[1],"Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,"
3966,WORDSWORTH[1],The horizon's utmost boundary; far above
3967,WORDSWORTH[1],Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.
3968,WORDSWORTH[1],She was an elfin pinnace; lustily
3969,WORDSWORTH[1],"I dipped my oars into the silent lake,"
3970,WORDSWORTH[1],"And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat"
3971,WORDSWORTH[1],Went heaving through the water like a swan;
3972,WORDSWORTH[1],"When, from behind that craggy steep till then"
3973,WORDSWORTH[1],"The horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,"
3974,WORDSWORTH[1],"As if with voluntary power instinct,"
3975,WORDSWORTH[1],"Upreared its head. I struck and struck again,"
3976,WORDSWORTH[1],And growing still in stature the grim shape
3977,WORDSWORTH[1],"Towered up between me and the stars, and still,"
3978,WORDSWORTH[1],"For so it seemed, with purpose of its own"
3979,WORDSWORTH[1],"And measured motion like a living thing,"
3980,WORDSWORTH[1],"Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,"
3981,WORDSWORTH[1],And through the silent water stole my way
3982,WORDSWORTH[1],Back to the covert of the willow tree;
3983,WORDSWORTH[1],"There in her mooring-place I left my bark,--"
3984,WORDSWORTH[1],"And through the meadows homeward went, in grave"
3985,WORDSWORTH[1],And serious mood; but after I had seen
3986,WORDSWORTH[1],"That spectacle, for many days, my brain"
3987,WORDSWORTH[1],Worked with a dim and undetermined sense
3988,WORDSWORTH[1],Of unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts
3989,WORDSWORTH[1],"There hung a darkness, call it solitude"
3990,WORDSWORTH[1],Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes
3991,WORDSWORTH[1],"Remained, no pleasant images of trees,"
3992,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;"
3993,WORDSWORTH[1],"But huge and mighty forms, that do not live"
3994,WORDSWORTH[1],"Like living men, moved slowly through the mind"
3995,WORDSWORTH[1],"By day, and were a trouble to my dreams."
3996,WORDSWORTH[1],
3997,WORDSWORTH[1],The best commentary on a poem is generally to be found in the poet's
3998,WORDSWORTH[1],other works. And those last dozen lines furnish the best commentary on
3999,WORDSWORTH[1],"that famous passage in the _Ode_, where the poet, looking back to his"
4000,WORDSWORTH[1],"childhood, gives thanks for it,--not however for its careless delight"
4001,WORDSWORTH[1],"and liberty,"
4002,WORDSWORTH[1],
4003,WORDSWORTH[1],But for those obstinate questionings
4004,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of sense and outward things,"
4005,WORDSWORTH[1],"Fallings from us, vanishings;"
4006,WORDSWORTH[1],Blank misgivings of a Creature
4007,WORDSWORTH[1],"Moving about in worlds not realised,"
4008,WORDSWORTH[1],High instincts before which our mortal Nature
4009,WORDSWORTH[1],Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised.
4010,WORDSWORTH[1],
4011,WORDSWORTH[1],"Whether, or how, these experiences afford 'intimations of immortality'"
4012,WORDSWORTH[1],is not in question here; but it will never do to dismiss them so airily
4013,WORDSWORTH[1],as Arnold did. Without them Wordsworth is not Wordsworth.
4014,WORDSWORTH[1],
4015,WORDSWORTH[1],The most striking recollections of his childhood have not in all cases
4016,WORDSWORTH[1],"this manifest affinity to the _Ode_, but wherever the visionary feeling"
4017,WORDSWORTH[1],"appears in them (and it appears in many), this affinity is still"
4018,WORDSWORTH[1],"traceable. There is, for instance, in _Prelude_, xii., the description"
4019,WORDSWORTH[1],"of the crag, from which, on a wild dark day, the boy watched eagerly"
4020,WORDSWORTH[1],the two highways below for the ponies that were coming to take him home
4021,WORDSWORTH[1],"for the holidays. It is too long to quote, but every reader of it will"
4022,WORDSWORTH[1],remember
4023,WORDSWORTH[1],
4024,WORDSWORTH[1],"the wind and sleety rain,"
4025,WORDSWORTH[1],"And all the business of the elements,"
4026,WORDSWORTH[1],"The single sheep, and the one blasted tree,"
4027,WORDSWORTH[1],"And the bleak music from that old stone wall,"
4028,WORDSWORTH[1],"The noise of wood and water, and the mist"
4029,WORDSWORTH[1],That on the line of each of those two roads
4030,WORDSWORTH[1],Advanced in such indisputable shapes.
4031,WORDSWORTH[1],
4032,WORDSWORTH[1],"Everything here is natural, but everything is apocalyptic. And we happen"
4033,WORDSWORTH[1],to know why. Wordsworth is describing the scene in the light of memory.
4034,WORDSWORTH[1],"In that eagerly expected holiday his father died; and the scene, as he"
4035,WORDSWORTH[1],"recalled it, was charged with the sense of contrast between the narrow"
4036,WORDSWORTH[1],"world of common pleasures and blind and easy hopes, and the vast unseen"
4037,WORDSWORTH[1],world which encloses it in beneficent yet dark and inexorable arms. The
4038,WORDSWORTH[1],"visionary feeling has here a peculiar tone; but always, openly or"
4039,WORDSWORTH[1],"covertly, it is the intimation of something illimitable, over-arching or"
4040,WORDSWORTH[1],breaking into the customary 'reality.' Its character varies; and so
4041,WORDSWORTH[1],"sometimes at its touch the soul, suddenly conscious of its own infinity,"
4042,WORDSWORTH[1],melts in rapture into that infinite being; while at other times the
4043,WORDSWORTH[1],"'mortal nature' stands dumb, incapable of thought, or shrinking from"
4044,WORDSWORTH[1],some presence
4045,WORDSWORTH[1],
4046,WORDSWORTH[1],"Not un-informed with Phantasy, and looks"
4047,WORDSWORTH[1],That threaten the profane.
4048,WORDSWORTH[1],
4049,WORDSWORTH[1],This feeling is so essential to many of Wordsworth's most characteristic
4050,WORDSWORTH[1],poems that it may almost be called their soul; and failure to understand
4051,WORDSWORTH[1],them frequently arises from obtuseness to it. It appears in a mild and
4052,WORDSWORTH[1],"tender form, but quite openly, in the lines _To a Highland Girl_, where"
4053,WORDSWORTH[1],"the child, and the rocks and trees and lake and road by her home, seem"
4054,WORDSWORTH[1],to the poet
4055,WORDSWORTH[1],
4056,WORDSWORTH[1],Like something fashioned in a dream.
4057,WORDSWORTH[1],
4058,WORDSWORTH[1],It gives to _The Solitary Reaper_ its note of remoteness and wonder; and
4059,WORDSWORTH[1],even the slight shock of bewilderment due to it is felt in the opening
4060,WORDSWORTH[1],line of the most famous stanza:
4061,WORDSWORTH[1],
4062,WORDSWORTH[1],Will no one tell me what she sings?
4063,WORDSWORTH[1],
4064,WORDSWORTH[1],"Its etherial music accompanies every vision of the White Doe, and sounds"
4065,WORDSWORTH[1],faintly to us from far away through all the tale of failure and anguish.
4066,WORDSWORTH[1],Without it such shorter narratives as _Hartleap Well_ and _Resolution
4067,WORDSWORTH[1],and Independence_ would lose the imaginative atmosphere which adds
4068,WORDSWORTH[1],mystery and grandeur to the apparently simple 'moral.'
4069,WORDSWORTH[1],
4070,WORDSWORTH[1],In _Hartleap Well_ it is conveyed at first by slight touches of
4071,WORDSWORTH[1],"contrast. Sir Walter, in his long pursuit of the Hart, has mounted his"
4072,WORDSWORTH[1],third horse.
4073,WORDSWORTH[1],
4074,WORDSWORTH[1],Joy sparkled in the prancing courser's eyes;
4075,WORDSWORTH[1],The horse and horseman are a happy pair;
4076,WORDSWORTH[1],"But, though Sir Walter like a falcon flies,"
4077,WORDSWORTH[1],There is a doleful silence in the air.
4078,WORDSWORTH[1],
4079,WORDSWORTH[1],"A rout this morning left Sir Walter's hall,"
4080,WORDSWORTH[1],That as they galloped made the echoes roar;
4081,WORDSWORTH[1],"But horse and man are vanished, one and all;"
4082,WORDSWORTH[1],"Such race, I think, was never seen before."
4083,WORDSWORTH[1],
4084,WORDSWORTH[1],"At last even the dogs are left behind, stretched one by one among the"
4085,WORDSWORTH[1],mountain fern.
4086,WORDSWORTH[1],
4087,WORDSWORTH[1],"Where is the throng, the tumult of the race?"
4088,WORDSWORTH[1],The bugles that so joyfully were blown?
4089,WORDSWORTH[1],--This chase it looks not like an earthly chase;
4090,WORDSWORTH[1],Sir Walter and the Hart are left alone.
4091,WORDSWORTH[1],
4092,WORDSWORTH[1],Thus the poem begins. At the end we have the old shepherd's description
4093,WORDSWORTH[1],of the utter desolation of the spot where the waters of the little
4094,WORDSWORTH[1],"spring had trembled with the last deep groan of the dying stag, and"
4095,WORDSWORTH[1],"where the Knight, to commemorate his exploit, had built a basin for the"
4096,WORDSWORTH[1],"spring, three pillars to mark the last three leaps of his victim, and a"
4097,WORDSWORTH[1],"pleasure-house, surrounded by trees and trailing plants, for the summer"
4098,WORDSWORTH[1],"joy of himself and his paramour. But now 'the pleasure-house is dust,'"
4099,WORDSWORTH[1],"and the trees are grey, 'with neither arms nor head':"
4100,WORDSWORTH[1],
4101,WORDSWORTH[1],"Now, here is neither grass nor pleasant shade;"
4102,WORDSWORTH[1],The sun on drearier hollow never shone;
4103,WORDSWORTH[1],"So will it be, as I have often said,"
4104,WORDSWORTH[1],"Till trees, and stones, and fountain all are gone."
4105,WORDSWORTH[1],
4106,WORDSWORTH[1],"It is only this feeling of the presence of mysterious inviolable Powers,"
4107,WORDSWORTH[1],"behind the momentary powers of hard pleasure and empty pride, that"
4108,WORDSWORTH[1],justifies the solemnity of the stanza:
4109,WORDSWORTH[1],
4110,WORDSWORTH[1],"The Being, that is in the clouds and air,"
4111,WORDSWORTH[1],"That is in the green leaves among the groves,"
4112,WORDSWORTH[1],Maintains a deep and reverential care
4113,WORDSWORTH[1],For the unoffending creatures whom he loves.
4114,WORDSWORTH[1],
4115,WORDSWORTH[1],"_Hartleap Well_ is a beautiful poem, but whether it is entirely"
4116,WORDSWORTH[1],"successful is, perhaps, doubtful. There can be no sort of doubt as to"
4117,WORDSWORTH[1],"_Resolution and Independence_, probably, if we must choose, the most"
4118,WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworthian of Wordsworth's poems, and the best test of ability to"
4119,WORDSWORTH[1],"understand him. The story, if given in a brief argument, would sound far"
4120,WORDSWORTH[1],"from promising. We should expect for it, too, a ballad form somewhat"
4121,WORDSWORTH[1],"like that of _Simon Lee_. When we read it, we find instead lines of"
4122,WORDSWORTH[1],"extraordinary grandeur, but, mingled with them, lines more pedestrian"
4123,WORDSWORTH[1],"than could be found in an impressive poem from any other hand,--for"
4124,WORDSWORTH[1],"instance,"
4125,WORDSWORTH[1],
4126,WORDSWORTH[1],"And, drawing to his side, to him did say,"
4127,WORDSWORTH[1],'This morning gives us promise of a glorious day.'
4128,WORDSWORTH[1],
4129,WORDSWORTH[1],"or,"
4130,WORDSWORTH[1],
4131,WORDSWORTH[1],"'How is it that you live, and what is it you do?'"
4132,WORDSWORTH[1],
4133,WORDSWORTH[1],"We meet also with that perplexed persistence, and that helpless"
4134,WORDSWORTH[1],"reiteration of a question (in this case one already clearly answered),"
4135,WORDSWORTH[1],"which in other poems threatens to become ludicrous, and on which a"
4136,WORDSWORTH[1],writer with a keener sense of the ludicrous would hardly have ventured.
4137,WORDSWORTH[1],"Yet with all this, and by dint of all this, we read with bated breath,"
4138,WORDSWORTH[1],almost as if we were in the presence of that 'majestical' Spirit in
4139,WORDSWORTH[1],"_Hamlet_, come to 'admonish' from another world, though not this time by"
4140,WORDSWORTH[1],"terror. And one source of this effect is the confusion, the almost"
4141,WORDSWORTH[1],"hypnotic obliteration of the habitual reasoning mind, that falls on the"
4142,WORDSWORTH[1],"poet as he gazes at the leech-gatherer, and hears, without"
4143,WORDSWORTH[1],"understanding, his plain reply to the enquiry about himself and the"
4144,WORDSWORTH[1],prosaic 'occupation' he 'pursues':
4145,WORDSWORTH[1],
4146,WORDSWORTH[1],The old man still stood talking by my side;
4147,WORDSWORTH[1],But now his voice to me was like a stream
4148,WORDSWORTH[1],Scarce heard; nor word from word could I divide;
4149,WORDSWORTH[1],And the whole body of the man did seem
4150,WORDSWORTH[1],Like one whom I had met with in a dream;
4151,WORDSWORTH[1],"Or like a man from some far region sent,"
4152,WORDSWORTH[1],"To give me human strength, by apt admonishment."
4153,WORDSWORTH[1],
4154,WORDSWORTH[1],"The same question was asked again, and the answer was repeated. But"
4155,WORDSWORTH[1],
4156,WORDSWORTH[1],"While he was talking thus, the lonely place,"
4157,WORDSWORTH[1],"The old man's shape, and speech, all troubled me."
4158,WORDSWORTH[1],
4159,WORDSWORTH[1],'Trouble' is a word not seldom employed by the poet to denote the
4160,WORDSWORTH[1],"confusion caused by some visionary experience. Here are, again, the"
4161,WORDSWORTH[1],"fallings from us, vanishings, blank misgivings, dim fore-feelings of the"
4162,WORDSWORTH[1],soul's infinity.
4163,WORDSWORTH[1],
4164,WORDSWORTH[1],Out of many illustrations I will choose three more. There is in the
4165,WORDSWORTH[1],"_Prelude_, iv., the passage (so strongly resembling _Resolution and"
4166,WORDSWORTH[1],Independence_ that I merely refer to it) where Wordsworth describes an
4167,WORDSWORTH[1],"old soldier suddenly seen, leaning against a milestone on the moon-lit"
4168,WORDSWORTH[1],"road, all alone:"
4169,WORDSWORTH[1],
4170,WORDSWORTH[1],No living thing appeared in earth or air;
4171,WORDSWORTH[1],"And, save the flowing water's peaceful voice,"
4172,WORDSWORTH[1],Sound there was none ...
4173,WORDSWORTH[1],... still his form
4174,WORDSWORTH[1],Kept the same awful steadiness--at his feet
4175,WORDSWORTH[1],"His shadow lay, and moved not."
4176,WORDSWORTH[1],
4177,WORDSWORTH[1],His shadow proves he was no ghost; but a ghost was never ghostlier than
4178,WORDSWORTH[1],"he. And by him we may place the London beggar of _Prelude_, vii.:"
4179,WORDSWORTH[1],
4180,WORDSWORTH[1],"How oft, amid those overflowing streets,"
4181,WORDSWORTH[1],"Have I gone forward with the crowd, and said"
4182,WORDSWORTH[1],"Unto myself, 'The face of every one"
4183,WORDSWORTH[1],That passes by me is a mystery!'
4184,WORDSWORTH[1],"Thus have I looked, nor ceased to look, oppressed"
4185,WORDSWORTH[1],"By thoughts of what and whither, when and how,"
4186,WORDSWORTH[1],Until the shapes before my eyes became
4187,WORDSWORTH[1],"A second-sight procession, such as glides"
4188,WORDSWORTH[1],"Over still mountains, or appears in dreams;"
4189,WORDSWORTH[1],"And once, far-travelled in such mood, beyond"
4190,WORDSWORTH[1],"The reach of common indication, lost"
4191,WORDSWORTH[1],"Amid the moving pageant, I was smitten"
4192,WORDSWORTH[1],"Abruptly, with the view (a sight not rare)"
4193,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of a blind Beggar, who, with upright face,"
4194,WORDSWORTH[1],"Stood, propped against a wall, upon his chest"
4195,WORDSWORTH[1],"Wearing a written paper, to explain"
4196,WORDSWORTH[1],"His story, whence he came, and who he was."
4197,WORDSWORTH[1],Caught by the spectacle my mind turned round
4198,WORDSWORTH[1],As with the might of waters; an apt type
4199,WORDSWORTH[1],"This label seemed of the utmost we can know,"
4200,WORDSWORTH[1],Both of ourselves and of the universe;
4201,WORDSWORTH[1],"And, on the shape of that unmoving man,"
4202,WORDSWORTH[1],"His steadfast face and sightless eyes, I gazed,"
4203,WORDSWORTH[1],As if admonished from another world.
4204,WORDSWORTH[1],
4205,WORDSWORTH[1],"Still more curious psychologically is the passage, in the preceding book"
4206,WORDSWORTH[1],"of the _Prelude_, which tells us of a similar shock and leads to the"
4207,WORDSWORTH[1],description of its effects. The more prosaically I introduce the
4208,WORDSWORTH[1],"passage, the better. Wordsworth and Jones ('Jones, as from Calais"
4209,WORDSWORTH[1],"southward you and I') set out to walk over the Simplon, then traversed"
4210,WORDSWORTH[1],"only by a rough mule-track. They wandered out of the way, and, meeting a"
4211,WORDSWORTH[1],"peasant, discovered from his answers to their questions that, without"
4212,WORDSWORTH[1],"knowing it, they '_had crossed the Alps_.' This may not sound important,"
4213,WORDSWORTH[1],"and the italics are Wordsworth's, not mine. But the next words are"
4214,WORDSWORTH[1],these:
4215,WORDSWORTH[1],
4216,WORDSWORTH[1],Imagination--here the Power so called
4217,WORDSWORTH[1],"Through sad incompetence of human speech,"
4218,WORDSWORTH[1],That awful Power rose from the mind's abyss
4219,WORDSWORTH[1],"Like an unfathered vapour that enwraps,"
4220,WORDSWORTH[1],"At once, some lonely traveller. I was lost;"
4221,WORDSWORTH[1],Halted without an effort to break through;
4222,WORDSWORTH[1],But to my conscious soul I now can say--
4223,WORDSWORTH[1],'I recognise thy glory': in such strength
4224,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of usurpation, when the light of sense"
4225,WORDSWORTH[1],"Goes out, but with a flash that has revealed"
4226,WORDSWORTH[1],"The invisible world, doth greatness make abode,"
4227,WORDSWORTH[1],"There harbours; whether we be young or old,"
4228,WORDSWORTH[1],"Our destiny, our being's heart and home,"
4229,WORDSWORTH[1],"Is with infinitude, and only there;"
4230,WORDSWORTH[1],"With hope it is, hope that can never die,"
4231,WORDSWORTH[1],"Effort, and expectation, and desire,"
4232,WORDSWORTH[1],And something evermore about to be.
4233,WORDSWORTH[1],
4234,WORDSWORTH[1],And what was the result of this shock? The poet may answer for himself
4235,WORDSWORTH[1],in some of the greatest lines in English poetry. The travellers
4236,WORDSWORTH[1],proceeded on their way down the Defile of Gondo.
4237,WORDSWORTH[1],
4238,WORDSWORTH[1],"Downwards we hurried fast,"
4239,WORDSWORTH[1],"And, with the half-shaped road which we had missed,"
4240,WORDSWORTH[1],Entered a narrow chasm. The brook and road
4241,WORDSWORTH[1],"Were fellow-travellers in this gloomy strait,"
4242,WORDSWORTH[1],And with them did we journey several hours
4243,WORDSWORTH[1],At a slow pace. The immeasurable height
4244,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of woods decaying, never to be decayed,"
4245,WORDSWORTH[1],"The stationary blasts of waterfalls,"
4246,WORDSWORTH[1],And in the narrow rent at every turn
4247,WORDSWORTH[1],"Winds thwarting winds, bewildered and forlorn,"
4248,WORDSWORTH[1],"The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,"
4249,WORDSWORTH[1],"The rocks that muttered close upon our ears,"
4250,WORDSWORTH[1],Black drizzling crags that spake by the way-side
4251,WORDSWORTH[1],"As if a voice were in them, the sick sight"
4252,WORDSWORTH[1],"And giddy prospect of the raving stream,"
4253,WORDSWORTH[1],"The unfettered clouds and region of the Heavens,"
4254,WORDSWORTH[1],"Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light--"
4255,WORDSWORTH[1],"Were all like workings of one mind, the features"
4256,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree;"
4257,WORDSWORTH[1],"Characters of the great Apocalypse,"
4258,WORDSWORTH[1],"The types and symbols of Eternity,"
4259,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of first, and last, and midst, and without end.[18]"
4260,WORDSWORTH[1],
4261,WORDSWORTH[1],"I hardly think that 'the poet of Surrey, say, and the prophet of its"
4262,WORDSWORTH[1],life' could have written thus. And of all the poems to which I have
4263,WORDSWORTH[1],"lately referred, and all the passages I have quoted, there are but two"
4264,WORDSWORTH[1],or three which do not cry aloud that their birth-place was the moor or
4265,WORDSWORTH[1],"the mountain, and that severed from their birth-place they would perish."
4266,WORDSWORTH[1],"The more sublime they are, or the nearer they approach sublimity, the"
4267,WORDSWORTH[1],"more is this true. The cry of the cuckoo in _O blithe new-comer_, though"
4268,WORDSWORTH[1],"visionary, is not sublime; but, echoed by the mountain, it is"
4269,WORDSWORTH[1],
4270,WORDSWORTH[1],"Like--but oh, how different![19]"
4271,WORDSWORTH[1],
4272,WORDSWORTH[1],"It was among the mountains that Wordsworth, as he says of his Wanderer,"
4273,WORDSWORTH[1],_felt_ his faith. It was there that all things
4274,WORDSWORTH[1],
4275,WORDSWORTH[1],"Breathed immortality, revolving life,"
4276,WORDSWORTH[1],And greatness still revolving; infinite.
4277,WORDSWORTH[1],There littleness was not; the least of things
4278,WORDSWORTH[1],Seemed infinite; and there his spirit shaped
4279,WORDSWORTH[1],"Her prospects, nor did he believe,--he _saw_."
4280,WORDSWORTH[1],
4281,WORDSWORTH[1],"And even if we count his vision a mere dream, still he put into words,"
4282,WORDSWORTH[1],"as no other poet has, the spirit of the mountains."
4283,WORDSWORTH[1],
4284,WORDSWORTH[1],"Two voices are there; one is of the sea,"
4285,WORDSWORTH[1],One of the mountains; each a mighty voice.
4286,WORDSWORTH[1],
4287,WORDSWORTH[1],And of the second of these we may say that 'few or none hears it right'
4288,WORDSWORTH[1],now he is gone.
4289,WORDSWORTH[1],
4290,WORDSWORTH[1],"Partly because he is the poet of mountains he is, even more"
4291,WORDSWORTH[1],"pre-eminently, the poet of solitude. For there are tones in the mountain"
4292,WORDSWORTH[1],"voice scarcely audible except in solitude, and the reader whom"
4293,WORDSWORTH[1],Wordsworth's greatest poetry baffles could have no better advice offered
4294,WORDSWORTH[1],him than to do what he has probably never done in his life--to be on a
4295,WORDSWORTH[1],"mountain alone. But for Wordsworth not this solitude only, but all"
4296,WORDSWORTH[1],solitude and all things solitary had an extraordinary fascination.
4297,WORDSWORTH[1],
4298,WORDSWORTH[1],"The outward shows of sky and earth,"
4299,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of hill and valley, he has viewed;"
4300,WORDSWORTH[1],And impulses _of deeper birth_
4301,WORDSWORTH[1],Have come to him in solitude.
4302,WORDSWORTH[1],
4303,WORDSWORTH[1],"The sense of solitude, it will readily be found, is essential to nearly"
4304,WORDSWORTH[1],"all the poems and passages we have been considering, and to some of"
4305,WORDSWORTH[1],"quite a different character, such as the Daffodil stanzas. And it is not"
4306,WORDSWORTH[1],merely that the poet is alone; what he sees is so too. If the
4307,WORDSWORTH[1],leech-gatherer and the soldier on the moon-lit road had not been
4308,WORDSWORTH[1],"solitary figures, they would not have awaked 'the visionary power'; and"
4309,WORDSWORTH[1],it is scarcely fanciful to add that if the boy who was watching for his
4310,WORDSWORTH[1],father's ponies had had beside him any more than
4311,WORDSWORTH[1],
4312,WORDSWORTH[1],"The _single_ sheep and the _one_ blasted tree,"
4313,WORDSWORTH[1],
4314,WORDSWORTH[1],the mist would not have advanced along the roads 'in such indisputable
4315,WORDSWORTH[1],shapes.' With Wordsworth that power seems to have sprung into life at
4316,WORDSWORTH[1],once on the perception of loneliness. What is lonely is a spirit. To
4317,WORDSWORTH[1],"call a thing lonely or solitary is, with him, to say that it opens a"
4318,WORDSWORTH[1],bright or solemn vista into infinity. He himself 'wanders lonely as a
4319,WORDSWORTH[1],cloud': he seeks the 'souls of lonely places': he listens in awe to
4320,WORDSWORTH[1],
4321,WORDSWORTH[1],"One voice, the solitary raven ..."
4322,WORDSWORTH[1],"An iron knell, with echoes from afar:"
4323,WORDSWORTH[1],
4324,WORDSWORTH[1],"against the distant sky he descries the shepherd,"
4325,WORDSWORTH[1],
4326,WORDSWORTH[1],"A solitary object and sublime,"
4327,WORDSWORTH[1],Above all height! like an aerial cross
4328,WORDSWORTH[1],Stationed alone upon a spiry rock
4329,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of the Chartreuse, for worship."
4330,WORDSWORTH[1],
4331,WORDSWORTH[1],"But this theme might be pursued for hours, and I will refer only to two"
4332,WORDSWORTH[1],"poems more. The editor of the _Golden Treasury_, a book never to be"
4333,WORDSWORTH[1],"thought of without gratitude, changed the title _The Solitary_ _Reaper_"
4334,WORDSWORTH[1],into _The Highland Reaper_. He may have had his reasons. Perhaps he had
4335,WORDSWORTH[1],met some one who thought that the Reaper belonged to Surrey. Still the
4336,WORDSWORTH[1],change was a mistake: the 'solitary' in Wordsworth's title gave the
4337,WORDSWORTH[1],"keynote. The other poem is _Lucy Gray_. 'When I was little,' a lover of"
4338,WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth once said, 'I could hardly bear to read _Lucy Gray_, it made"
4339,WORDSWORTH[1],"me feel so lonely.' Wordsworth called it _Lucy Gray, or Solitude_, and"
4340,WORDSWORTH[1],"this young reader understood him. But there is too much, reason to fear"
4341,WORDSWORTH[1],that for half his readers his 'solitary child' is generalised into a
4342,WORDSWORTH[1],"mere 'little girl,' and that they never receive the main impression he"
4343,WORDSWORTH[1],"wished to produce. Yet his intention is announced in the opening lines,"
4344,WORDSWORTH[1],"and as clearly shown in the lovely final stanzas, which give even to"
4345,WORDSWORTH[1],this ballad the visionary touch which distinguishes it from _Alice
4346,WORDSWORTH[1],Fell_:
4347,WORDSWORTH[1],
4348,WORDSWORTH[1],Yet some maintain that to this day
4349,WORDSWORTH[1],She is a living child;
4350,WORDSWORTH[1],That you may see sweet Lucy Gray
4351,WORDSWORTH[1],Upon the lonesome wild.
4352,WORDSWORTH[1],
4353,WORDSWORTH[1],"O'er rough and smooth she trips along,"
4354,WORDSWORTH[1],And never looks behind;
4355,WORDSWORTH[1],And sings a solitary song
4356,WORDSWORTH[1],That whistles in the wind.
4357,WORDSWORTH[1],
4358,WORDSWORTH[1],The solitariness which exerted so potent a spell on Wordsworth had in it
4359,WORDSWORTH[1],nothing 'Byronic.' He preached in the _Excursion_ against the solitude
4360,WORDSWORTH[1],"of 'self-indulging spleen.' He was even aware that he himself, though"
4361,WORDSWORTH[1],"free from that weakness, had felt"
4362,WORDSWORTH[1],
4363,WORDSWORTH[1],perhaps too much
4364,WORDSWORTH[1],The self-sufficing power of Solitude.[20]
4365,WORDSWORTH[1],
4366,WORDSWORTH[1],No poet is more emphatically the poet of community. A great part of his
4367,WORDSWORTH[1],verse--a part as characteristic and as precious as the part on which I
4368,WORDSWORTH[1],have been dwelling--is dedicated to the affections of home and
4369,WORDSWORTH[1],"neighbourhood and country, and to that soul of joy and love which links"
4370,WORDSWORTH[1],"together all Nature's children, and 'steals from earth to man, from man"
4371,WORDSWORTH[1],to earth.' And this soul is for him as truly the presence of 'the Being
4372,WORDSWORTH[1],"that is in the clouds and air' and in the mind of man as are the power,"
4373,WORDSWORTH[1],"the darkness, the silence, the strange gleams and mysterious visitations"
4374,WORDSWORTH[1],which startle and confuse with intimations of infinity. But solitude and
4375,WORDSWORTH[1],"solitariness were to him, in the main, one of these intimations. They"
4376,WORDSWORTH[1],had not for him merely the 'eeriness' which they have at times for
4377,WORDSWORTH[1],"everyone, though that was essential to some of the poems we have"
4378,WORDSWORTH[1],"reviewed. They were the symbol of power to stand alone, to be"
4379,WORDSWORTH[1],"'self-sufficing,' to dispense with custom and surroundings and aid and"
4380,WORDSWORTH[1],sympathy--a self-dependence at once the image and the communication of
4381,WORDSWORTH[1],'the soul of all the worlds.' Even when they were full of 'sounds and
4382,WORDSWORTH[1],"sweet airs that give delight and hurt not,' the solitude of the Reaper"
4383,WORDSWORTH[1],"or of Lucy, they so appealed to him. But they appealed also to that"
4384,WORDSWORTH[1],"austerer strain which led him to love 'bare trees and mountains bare,'"
4385,WORDSWORTH[1],"and lonely places, and the bleak music of the old stone wall, and to"
4386,WORDSWORTH[1],"dwell with awe, and yet with exultation, on the majesty of that"
4387,WORDSWORTH[1],'unconquerable mind' which through long years holds its solitary
4388,WORDSWORTH[1],"purpose, sustains its solitary passion, feeds upon its solitary anguish."
4389,WORDSWORTH[1],"For this mind, as for the blind beggar or the leech-gatherer, the 'light"
4390,WORDSWORTH[1],of sense' and the sweetness of life have faded or 'gone out'; but in it
4391,WORDSWORTH[1],"'greatness makes abode,' and it 'retains its station proud,' 'by form or"
4392,WORDSWORTH[1],"image unprofaned.' Thus, in whatever guise it might present itself,"
4393,WORDSWORTH[1],solitariness 'carried far into his heart' the haunting sense of an
4394,WORDSWORTH[1],'invisible world'; of some Life beyond this 'transitory being' and
4395,WORDSWORTH[1],'unapproachable by death';
4396,WORDSWORTH[1],
4397,WORDSWORTH[1],"Of Life continuous, Being unimpaired;"
4398,WORDSWORTH[1],"That hath been, is, and where it was and is"
4399,WORDSWORTH[1],"There shall endure,--existence unexposed"
4400,WORDSWORTH[1],To the blind walk of mortal accident;
4401,WORDSWORTH[1],From diminution safe and weakening age;
4402,WORDSWORTH[1],"While man grows old, and dwindles, and decays;"
4403,WORDSWORTH[1],And countless generations of mankind
4404,WORDSWORTH[1],Depart; and leave no vestige where they trod.
4405,WORDSWORTH[1],
4406,WORDSWORTH[1],"For me, I confess, all this is far from being 'mere poetry'--partly"
4407,WORDSWORTH[1],because I do not believe that any such thing as 'mere poetry' exists.
4408,WORDSWORTH[1],"But whatever kind or degree of truth we may find in all this, everything"
4409,WORDSWORTH[1],"in Wordsworth that is sublime or approaches sublimity has, directly or"
4410,WORDSWORTH[1],"more remotely, to do with it. And without this part of his poetry"
4411,WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth would be 'shorn of his strength,' and would no longer stand,"
4412,WORDSWORTH[1],"as he does stand, nearer than any other poet of the Nineteenth Century"
4413,WORDSWORTH[1],to Milton.

4416,NOTE.,NOTE.
4417,NOTE.,
4418,NOTE.,I take this opportunity of airing a heresy about _We are Seven_.
4419,NOTE.,"Wordsworth's friend, James Tobin, who saw the _Lyrical Ballads_ while"
4420,NOTE.,"they were going through the press, told him that this poem would make"
4421,NOTE.,"him everlastingly ridiculous, and entreated him in vain to cancel it. I"
4422,NOTE.,"have forgotten how it was received in 1798, but it has long been one of"
4423,NOTE.,"the most popular of the ballad poems, and I do not think I have ever"
4424,NOTE.,"heard it ridiculed. I wonder, however, what its readers take to be the"
4425,NOTE.,"'moral' of it, for I have never been able to convince myself that the"
4426,NOTE.,'moral' given in the poem itself truly represents the imaginative
4427,NOTE.,impression from which the poem arose.
4428,NOTE.,
4429,NOTE.,"The 'moral' is in this instance put at the beginning, in the mutilated"
4430,NOTE.,opening stanza:
4431,NOTE.,
4432,NOTE.,"--------A simple child,"
4433,NOTE.,"That lightly draws its breath,"
4434,NOTE.,"And feels its life in every limb,"
4435,NOTE.,What should it know of death?
4436,NOTE.,
4437,NOTE.,"Wordsworth, in composing, began his poem with the end; and when it was"
4438,NOTE.,"all but finished he recited it to Dorothy and Coleridge, and observed"
4439,NOTE.,"that a prefatory stanza was wanted, and that he should enjoy his tea"
4440,NOTE.,better if he could add it first. Coleridge at once threw off the stanza
4441,NOTE.,"as we have it, except that the first line ran, 'A simple child, dear"
4442,NOTE.,"brother Jim,'--this Jim, who rhymes with 'limb,' being the James Tobin"
4443,NOTE.,who protested afterwards against the poem. The stanza was printed in the
4444,NOTE.,"_Lyrical Ballads_ as Coleridge made it, Wordsworth objecting to the"
4445,NOTE.,"words 'dear brother Jim' as ludicrous, but (apparently) giving way for"
4446,NOTE.,the sake of the joke of introducing Tobin.
4447,NOTE.,
4448,NOTE.,"Now the poem gains in one way by this stanza, which has a felicity of"
4449,NOTE.,style such as Wordsworth perhaps would not have achieved in expressing
4450,NOTE.,"the idea. And the idea was not only accepted by Wordsworth, but,"
4451,NOTE.,"according to his own account, he had mentioned in substance what he"
4452,NOTE.,"wished to be expressed. It must seem, therefore, outrageous to hint a"
4453,NOTE.,doubt whether the stanza truly represents the imaginative experience
4454,NOTE.,"from which the poem arose; and I can only say, in excuse, that this"
4455,NOTE.,"doubt does not spring from reflection, or from knowledge of Coleridge's"
4456,NOTE.,"authorship of the stanza, for I do not remember ever having read _We are"
4457,NOTE.,"Seven_ without feeling it or without saying to myself at the end, 'This"
4458,NOTE.,"means more than the first stanza says.' And, however improbable, it"
4459,NOTE.,cannot be called impossible that even so introspective a poet as
4460,NOTE.,Wordsworth might misconstrue the impression that stirred him to write. I
4461,NOTE.,"will take courage, therefore, to confess the belief that what stirred"
4462,NOTE.,him was the coincidence of the child's feelings with some of those
4463,NOTE.,feelings of his own childhood which he described in the Immortality
4464,NOTE.,"_Ode_, and once or twice in conversation, and which, in a less"
4465,NOTE.,"individual and peculiar form, he attributes, in the Essay on Epitaphs,"
4466,NOTE.,"to children in general. But, rather than argue the point, I will refer"
4467,NOTE.,to one or two passages. 'At that time I could not believe that I should
4468,NOTE.,"lie down quietly in the grave, and that my body would moulder into dust'"
4469,NOTE.,"(remark recorded by Bishop Wordsworth, _Prose Works_, ed. Grosart, iii."
4470,NOTE.,464). Is not this the condition of the child in _We are Seven_?
4471,NOTE.,"'Nothing,' he says to Miss Fenwick, 'was more difficult for me in"
4472,NOTE.,childhood than to admit the notion of death as a state applicable to my
4473,NOTE.,own being' (_ib._ iii. 194). He then quotes the first stanza of _We are
4474,NOTE.,Seven_. It is true that thereupon he expressly distinguishes his own
4475,NOTE.,"case from the child's, attributing the difficulty in her case to 'animal"
4476,NOTE.,vivacity.' But I have already fully admitted that Wordsworth's direct
4477,NOTE.,testimony goes against me; and I have now only to call attention to a
4478,NOTE.,passage in the Essay on Epitaphs. In that essay Wordsworth begins by
4479,NOTE.,saying that the custom of raising monuments to the dead 'proceeded
4480,NOTE.,"obviously from a two-fold desire; first, to guard the remains of the"
4481,NOTE.,"deceased from irreverent approach or from savage violation, and,"
4482,NOTE.,"secondly, to preserve their memory.' But these desires, in his opinion,"
4483,NOTE.,"resolve themselves into one, and both proceed from the consciousness or"
4484,NOTE.,"fore-feeling of immortality, also described as 'an intimation or"
4485,NOTE.,"assurance within us, that some part of our nature is imperishable.' And"
4486,NOTE.,"he goes on thus: 'If we look back upon the days of childhood, we shall"
4487,NOTE.,"find that the time is not in remembrance when, with respect to our own"
4488,NOTE.,"individual Being, the mind was without this assurance.... Forlorn, and"
4489,NOTE.,"cut off from communication with the best part of his nature, must that"
4490,NOTE.,"man be, who should derive the sense of immortality, as it exists in the"
4491,NOTE.,"mind of a child, from the same unthinking gaiety or liveliness of animal"
4492,NOTE.,spirits with which the lamb in the meadow or any other irrational
4493,NOTE.,creature is endowed; to an inability arising from the imperfect state of
4494,NOTE.,"his faculties to come, in any point of his being, into contact with a"
4495,NOTE.,notion of death; or to an unreflecting acquiescence in what had been
4496,NOTE.,"instilled into him!' Now Coleridge's stanza, and Wordsworth's own"
4497,NOTE.,"distinction between the child and himself, do come at least very near to"
4498,NOTE.,attributing the child's inability to realise the fact of death to that
4499,NOTE.,"very liveliness of animal spirits which, as a sufficient cause of it, is"
4500,NOTE.,"here indignantly repudiated. According to the present passage, this"
4501,NOTE.,inability ought to have been traced to that 'sense' or 'consciousness'
4502,NOTE.,of immortality which is inherent in human nature. And (whether or no
4503,NOTE.,"Wordsworth rightly describes this sense) it was _this_, I suggest, that,"
4504,NOTE.,"unknown to himself, arrested him in the child's persistent ignoring of"
4505,NOTE.,the fact of death. The poem is thus allied to the Immortality _Ode_. The
4506,NOTE.,child is in possession of one of those 'truths that wake to perish
4507,NOTE.,"never,' though the tyranny of the senses and the deadening influence of"
4508,NOTE.,custom obscure them as childhood passes away. When the conversation took
4509,NOTE.,"place (in 1793), and even when the poem was written (1798), Wordsworth"
4510,NOTE.,had not yet come to regard the experiences of his own childhood as he
4511,NOTE.,"saw them later (_Tintern Abbey_, 1798, shows this), and so he gave to"
4512,NOTE.,the poem a moral which is not adequate to it. Or perhaps he accepted
4513,NOTE.,from Coleridge a formulation of his moral which was not quite true even
4514,NOTE.,to his own thoughts at that time. It is just worth observing as possibly
4515,NOTE.,significant that the child in _We are Seven_ is not described as showing
4516,NOTE.,"any particular 'animal vivacity': she strikes one as rather a quiet,"
4517,NOTE.,"though determined, little person."
4518,NOTE.,
4519,NOTE.,"These remarks, of course, can have no interest for those readers who"
4520,NOTE.,"feel no misgivings, such as I have always felt, in reading the poem. But"
4521,NOTE.,"many, I think, must feel them."

4619,FOOTNOTES:,"The collocation of the last two quotations shows how, for Wordsworth,"
4620,FOOTNOTES:,"'the visionary power' arises from, and testifies to, the mind's"
4621,FOOTNOTES:,"infinity, and how the feeling of this is, or involves, or is united"
4622,FOOTNOTES:,"with, a feeling or idea of _the_ infinite or 'one mind,' and of union"
4623,FOOTNOTES:,with it. This connection of ideas (as to which I purposely use vague
4624,FOOTNOTES:,"alternative terms, because I do not want to theorise the poet's"
4625,FOOTNOTES:,"experience), is frequent or constant in Wordsworth, and it ought"
4626,FOOTNOTES:,always to be borne in mind in regard to his language about
4627,FOOTNOTES:,'immortality' or 'eternity.' His sense or consciousness of
4628,FOOTNOTES:,"'immortality,' that is to say, is at once a consciousness that he (in"
4629,FOOTNOTES:,"some sense of that word) is potentially infinite, and a consciousness"
4630,FOOTNOTES:,"that 'he' belongs to, is part of, is the home of, or is, an 'active"
4631,FOOTNOTES:,"principle' which is eternal, indivisible, and the 'soul of all the"
4632,FOOTNOTES:,"worlds' (cf. opening of _Excursion_, ix.). Whatever we may make of"
4633,FOOTNOTES:,"this connection of ideas, unless we realise it we shall remain"
4634,FOOTNOTES:,entirely outside Wordsworth's mind in passages like that just
4635,FOOTNOTES:,"referred to, and in passages where he talks of 'acts of immortality"
4636,FOOTNOTES:,"in Nature's course,' or says that to the Wanderer 'all things among"
4637,FOOTNOTES:,"the mountains breathed immortality,' or says that he has been"
4638,FOOTNOTES:,"unfolding 'far-stretching views of immortality,' though he may not"
4639,FOOTNOTES:,appear to us to have touched in any way on the subject. Nature and
4640,FOOTNOTES:,"Man (in one sense) are for Wordsworth 'transitory,' but Nature always"
4641,FOOTNOTES:,"and everywhere _reveals_ 'immortality,' and Man (in another sense) is"
4642,FOOTNOTES:,'immortal.' Unquestionably for Wordsworth he is so. In what precise
4643,FOOTNOTES:,"sense he is so for Wordsworth may not be discoverable, but the only"
4644,FOOTNOTES:,"chance of discovering it is to forget what we or anybody else, except"

4698,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,The ideas of Wordsworth and of Coleridge about poetry have often been
4699,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"discussed and are familiar. Those of Shelley are much less so, and in"
4700,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,his eloquent exposition of them there is a radiance which almost
4701,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"conceals them from many readers. I wish, at the cost of all the"
4702,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"radiance, to try to see them and show them rather more distinctly. Even"
4703,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"if they had little value for the theory of poetry, they would still have"
4704,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"much as material for it, since they allow us to look into a poet's"
4705,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"experience in conceiving and composing. And, in addition, they throw"
4706,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,light on some of the chief characteristics of Shelley's own poetry.
4707,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4708,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,His poems in their turn form one of the sources from which his ideas on
4709,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,the subject may be gathered. We have also some remarks in his letters
4710,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,and in prose pieces dealing with other topics. We have the prefaces to
4711,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"those of his works which he himself published. And, lastly, there is the"
4712,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,_Defence of Poetry_. This essay was written in reply to an attack made
4713,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"on contemporary verse by Shelley's friend Peacock,--not a favourable"
4714,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"specimen of Peacock's writing. The _Defence_, we can see, was hurriedly"
4715,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"composed, and it remains a fragment, being only the first of three"
4716,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"projected parts. It contains a good deal of historical matter, highly"
4717,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"interesting, but too extensive to be made use of here. Being polemical,"
4718,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,it no doubt exaggerates such of Shelley's views as collided with those
4719,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"of his antagonist. But, besides being the only full expression of these"
4720,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"views, it is the most mature, for it was written within eighteen months"
4721,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,of his death. It appears to owe very little either to Wordsworth's
4722,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,Prefaces or to Coleridge's _Biographia Literaria_; but there are a few
4723,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"reminiscences of Sidney's _Apology_, which Shelley had read just before"
4724,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"he wrote his own _Defence_; and it shows, like much of his mature"
4725,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"poetry, how deeply he was influenced by the more imaginative dialogues"
4726,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,of Plato.
4727,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4728,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4729,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,1.
4730,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4731,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,Any one familiar with the manner in which Shelley in his verse
4732,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,habitually represents the world could guess at his general view of
4733,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"poetry. The world to him is a melancholy place, a 'dim vast vale of"
4734,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"tears,' illuminated in flashes by the light of a hidden but glorious"
4735,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"power. Nor is this power, as that favourite metaphor would imply, wholly"
4736,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,outside the world. It works within it as a soul contending with
4737,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,obstruction and striving to penetrate and transform the whole mass. And
4738,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"though the fulness of its glory is concealed, its nature is known in"
4739,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,outline. It is the realised perfection of everything good and beautiful
4740,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"on earth; or, in other words, all such goodness and beauty is its"
4741,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"partial manifestation. 'All,' I say: for the splendour of nature, the"
4742,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"love of lovers, every affection and virtue, any good action or just law,"
4743,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the wisdom of philosophy, the creations of art, the truths deformed by"
4744,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"superstitious religion,--all are equally operations or appearances of"
4745,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,the hidden power. It is of the first importance for the understanding of
4746,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,Shelley to realise how strong in him is the sense and conviction of this
4747,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,unity in life: it is one of his Platonic traits. The intellectual Beauty
4748,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"of his _Hymn_ is absolutely the same thing as the Liberty of his _Ode_,"
4749,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the 'Great Spirit' of Love that he invokes to bring freedom to Naples,"
4750,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the One which in _Adonaïs_ he contrasts with the Many, the Spirit of"
4751,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Nature of _Queen Mab_, and the Vision of _Alastor_ and _Epipsychidion_."
4752,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"The skylark of the famous stanzas is free from our sorrows, not because"
4753,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"it is below them, but because, as an embodiment of that perfection, it"
4754,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"knows the rapture of love without its satiety, and understands death as"
4755,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"we cannot. The voice of the mountain, if a whole nation could hear it"
4756,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"with the poet's ear, would 'repeal large codes of fraud and woe'; it is"
4757,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,the same voice as the reformer's and the martyr's. And in the far-off
4758,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,day when the 'plastic stress' of this power has mastered the last
4759,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"resistance and is all in all, outward nature, which now suffers with"
4760,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"man, will be redeemed with him, and man, in becoming politically free,"
4761,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"will become also the perfect lover. Evidently, then, poetry, as the"
4762,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"world now is, must be one of the voices of this power, or one tone of"
4763,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"its voice. To use the language so dear to Shelley, it is the revelation"
4764,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"of those eternal ideas which lie behind the many-coloured, ever-shifting"
4765,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"veil that we call reality or life. Or rather, it is one such revelation"
4766,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,among many.
4767,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4768,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,When we turn to the _Defence of Poetry_ we meet substantially the same
4769,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,view. There is indeed a certain change; for Shelley is now
4770,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"philosophising and writing prose, and he wishes not to sing from the"
4771,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"mid-sky, but, for a while at least, to argue with his friend on the"
4772,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,earth. Hence at first we hear nothing of that perfect power at the heart
4773,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"of things, and poetry is considered as a creation rather than a"
4774,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"revelation. But for Shelley, we soon discover, this would be a false"
4775,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"antithesis. The poet creates, but this creation is no mere fancy of his;"
4776,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,it represents 'those forms which are common to universal nature and
4777,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"existence,' and 'a poem is the very image of life expressed in its"
4778,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"eternal truth.' We notice, further, that the more voluntary and"
4779,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,conscious work of invention and execution is regarded as quite
4780,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"subordinate in the creative process. In that process the mind, obedient"
4781,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"to an influence which it does not understand and cannot control, is"
4782,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,driven to produce images of perfection which rather form themselves in
4783,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,it than are formed by it. The greatest stress is laid on this influence
4784,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,or inspiration; and in the end we learn that the origin of the whole
4785,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,process lies in certain exceptional moments when visitations of thought
4786,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"and feeling, elevating and delightful beyond all expression, but always"
4787,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"arising unforeseen and departing unbidden, reach the soul; that these"
4788,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"are, as it were, the inter-penetration of a diviner nature through our"
4789,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"own; and that the province of the poet is to arrest these apparitions,"
4790,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"to veil them in language, to colour every other form he touches with"
4791,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"their evanescent hues, and so to 'redeem from decay the visitations of"
4792,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,the divinity in man.'
4793,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4794,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,Even more decided is the emphasis laid on the unity of all the forms in
4795,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"which the 'divinity' or ideal power thus attests its presence. Indeed,"
4796,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"throughout a large part of the essay, that 'Poetry' which Shelley is"
4797,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,defending is something very much wider than poetry in the usual sense.
4798,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,The enemy he has to meet is the contention that poetry and its influence
4799,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"steadily decline as civilisation advances, and that they are giving"
4800,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"place, and ought to give place, to reasoning and the pursuit of utility."
4801,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"His answer is that, on the contrary, imagination has been, is, and"
4802,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"always will be, the prime source of everything that has intrinsic value"
4803,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"in life. Reasoning, he declares, cannot create, it can only operate upon"
4804,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the products of imagination. Further, he holds that the predominance of"
4805,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,mere reasoning and mere utility has become in great part an evil; for
4806,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"while it has accumulated masses of material goods and moral truths, we"
4807,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"distribute the goods iniquitously and fail to apply the truths, because,"
4808,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"for want of imagination, we have not sympathy in our hearts and do not"
4809,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"feel what we know. The 'Poetry' which he defends, therefore, is the"
4810,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,whole creative imagination with all its products. And these include not
4811,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"merely literature in verse, but, first, whatever prose writing is allied"
4812,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"to that literature; and, next, all the other fine arts; and, finally,"
4813,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"all actions, inventions, institutions, and even ideas and moral"
4814,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"dispositions, which imagination brings into being in its effort to"
4815,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,satisfy the longing for perfection. Painters and musicians are poets.
4816,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Plato and Bacon, even Herodotus and Livy, were poets, though there is"
4817,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,much in their works which is not poetry. So were the men who invented
4818,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the arts of life, constructed laws for tribes or cities, disclosed, as"
4819,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"sages or founders of religion, the excellence of justice and love. And"
4820,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"every one, Shelley would say, who, perceiving the beauty of an imagined"
4821,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"virtue or deed, translates the image into a fact, is so far a poet. For"
4822,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,all these things come from imagination.
4823,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4824,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Shelley's exposition of this, which is probably the most original part"
4825,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"of his theory, is not very clear; but, if I understand his meaning, that"
4826,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,which he takes to happen in all these cases might be thus described. The
4827,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"imagination--that is to say, the soul imagining--has before it, or feels"
4828,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"within it, something which, answering perfectly to its nature, fills it"
4829,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,with delight and with a desire to realise what delights it. This
4830,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"something, for the sake of brevity, we may call an idea, so long as we"
4831,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,remember that it need not be distinctly imagined and that it is always
4832,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,accompanied by emotion. The reason why such ideas delight the imagining
4833,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"soul is that they are, in fact, images or forebodings of its own"
4834,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,perfection--of itself become perfect--in one aspect or another. These
4835,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,aspects are as various as the elements and forms of its own inner life
4836,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,and outward existence; and so the idea may be that of the perfect
4837,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"harmony of will and feeling (a virtue), or of the perfect union of soul"
4838,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"with soul (love), or of the perfect order of certain social relations"
4839,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"or forces (a law or institution), or of the perfect adjustment of"
4840,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,intellectual elements (a truth); and so on. The formation and expression
4841,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,of any such idea is thus the work of Poetry in the widest sense; while
4842,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"at the same time (as we must add, to complete Shelley's thought) any"
4843,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,such idea is a gleam or apparition of the perfect Intellectual Beauty.
4844,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4845,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,I choose this particular title of the hidden power or divinity in order
4846,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,to point out (what the reader is left to observe for himself) that the
4847,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"imaginative idea is always regarded by Shelley as beautiful. It is, for"
4848,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"example, desirable for itself and not merely as a means to a further"
4849,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"result; and it has the formal characters of beauty. For, as will have"
4850,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"been noticed in the instances given, it is always the image of an order,"
4851,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"or harmony, or unity in variety, of the elements concerned. Shelley"
4852,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"sometimes even speaks of their 'rhythm.' For example, he uses this word"
4853,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"in reference to an action; and I quote the passage because, though it"
4854,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"occurs at some distance from the exposition of his main view, it"
4855,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"illustrates it well. He is saying that the true poetry of Rome, unlike"
4856,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"that of Greece, did not fully express itself in poems. 'The true poetry"
4857,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"of Rome lived in its institutions: for whatever of beautiful, true and"
4858,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"majestic they contained, could have sprung only from the faculty which"
4859,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,creates the order in which they consist. The life of Camillus; the death
4860,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"of Regulus; the expectation of the senators, in their god-like state, of"
4861,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,the victorious Gauls; the refusal of the Republic to make peace with
4862,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,Hannibal after the battle of Cannæ'--these he describes as 'a rhythm and
4863,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"order in the shows of life,' an order not arranged with a view to"
4864,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"utility or outward result, but due to the imagination, which, 'beholding"
4865,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the beauty of this order, created it out of itself according to its own"
4866,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,idea.'
4867,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4868,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4869,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,2.
4870,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4871,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"If this, then, is the nature of Poetry in the widest sense, how does the"
4872,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"poet, in the special sense, differ from other unusually creative souls?"
4873,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Not essentially in the inspiration and general substance of his poetry,"
4874,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,but in the kind of expression he gives to them. In so far as he is a
4875,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"poet, his medium of expression, of course, is not virtue, or action, or"
4876,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"law; poetry is one of the acts. And, again, it differs from the rest,"
4877,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"because its particular vehicle is language. We have now to see,"
4878,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"therefore, what Shelley has to say of the form of poetry, and especially"
4879,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,of poetic language.
4880,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4881,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"First, he claims for language the highest place among the vehicles of"
4882,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"artistic expression, on the ground that it is the most direct and also"
4883,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,the most plastic. It is itself produced by imagination instead of being
4884,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"simply encountered by it, and it has no relation except to imagination;"
4885,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"whereas any more material medium has a nature of its own, and relations"
4886,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"to other things in the material world, and this nature and these"
4887,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,relations intervene between the artist's conception and his expression
4888,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,of it in the medium. It is to the superiority of its vehicle that
4889,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,Shelley attributes the greater fame which poetry has always enjoyed as
4890,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,compared with other arts. He forgets (if I may interpose a word of
4891,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"criticism) that the media of the other arts have, on their side, certain"
4892,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"advantages over language, and that these perhaps counterbalance the"
4893,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,inferiority which he notices. He would also have found it difficult to
4894,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"show that language, on its physical side, is any more a product of"
4895,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,imagination than stone or pigments. And his idea that the medium in the
4896,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,other arts is an obstacle intervening between conception and expression
4897,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"is, to say the least, one-sided. A sculptor, painter, or musician, would"
4898,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,probably reply that it is only the qualities of his medium that enable
4899,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,him to express at all; that what he expresses is inseparable from the
4900,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,vehicle of expression; and that he has no conceptions which are not from
4901,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the beginning sculpturesque, pictorial, or musical. It is true, no"
4902,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"doubt, that his medium is an obstacle as well as a medium; but this is"
4903,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,also true of language.
4904,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4905,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"But to resume. Language, Shelley goes on to say, receives in poetry a"
4906,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,peculiar form. As it represents in its meaning a perfection which is
4907,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"always an order, harmony, or rhythm, so it itself, as so much sound,"
4908,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"_is_ an order, harmony, or rhythm. It is measured language, which is not"
4909,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,the proper vehicle for the mere recital of facts or for mere reasoning.
4910,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"For Shelley, however, this measured language is not of necessity"
4911,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,metrical. The order or measure may remain at the stage which it reaches
4912,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"in beautiful prose, like that of Plato, the melody of whose language,"
4913,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Shelley declares, is the most intense it is possible to conceive. It may"
4914,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"again advance to metre; and he admits that metrical form is convenient,"
4915,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"popular, and preferable, especially in poetry containing much action."
4916,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,But he will not have any new great poet tied down to it. It is not
4917,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"essential, while measure is absolutely so. For it is no mere accident of"
4918,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"poetry that its language is measured, nor does a delight in this measure"
4919,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,mean little. As sensitiveness to the order of the relations of sounds is
4920,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,always connected with sensitiveness to the order of the relations of
4921,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"thoughts, so also the harmony of the words is scarcely less"
4922,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,indispensable than their meaning to the communication of the influence
4923,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"of poetry. 'Hence,' says Shelley, 'the vanity of translation: it were as"
4924,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,wise to cast a violet into a crucible that you might discover the formal
4925,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"principle of its colour and odour, as seek to transfuse from one"
4926,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,language into another the creations of a poet.' Strong words to come
4927,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,from the translator of the _Hymn to Mercury_ and of Agathon's speech in
4928,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,the _Symposium_![1] And is not all that Shelley says of the difference
4929,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"between measured and unrhythmical language applicable, at least in some"
4930,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"degree, to the difference between metrical and merely measured language?"
4931,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,Could he really have supposed that metre is no more than a
4932,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"'convenience,' which contributes nothing of any account to the influence"
4933,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,of poetry? But I will not criticise. Let me rather point out how
4934,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"surprising, at first sight, and how significant, is Shelley's insistence"
4935,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,on the importance of measure or rhythm. No one could assert more
4936,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,absolutely than he the identity of the general substance of poetry with
4937,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"that of moral life and action, of the other arts, and of the higher"
4938,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,kinds of philosophy. And yet it would be difficult to go beyond the
4939,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,emphasis of his statement that the formal element (as he understood it)
4940,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,is indispensable to the effect of poetry.
4941,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4942,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Shelley, however, nowhere considers this element more at length. He has"
4943,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"no discussions, like those of Wordsworth and Coleridge, on diction. He"
4944,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"never says, with Keats, that he looks on fine phrases like a lover. We"
4945,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,hear of his deep-drawn sigh of satisfaction as he finished reading a
4946,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"passage of Homer, but not of his shouting his delight, as he ramped"
4947,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"through the meadows of Spenser, at some marvellous flower. When in his"
4948,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"letters he refers to any poem he is reading, he scarcely ever mentions"
4949,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"particular lines or expressions; and we have no evidence that, like"
4950,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Coleridge and Keats, he was a curious student of metrical effects or the"
4951,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,relations of vowel-sounds. I doubt if all this is wholly accidental.
4952,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Poetry was to him so essentially an effusion of aspiration, love and"
4953,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"worship, that we can imagine his feeling it almost an impiety to break"
4954,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"up its unity even for purposes of study, and to give a separate"
4955,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,attention to its means of utterance. And what he does say on the
4956,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"subject confirms this impression. In the first place, as we have seen,"
4957,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"he lays great stress on inspiration; and his statements, if exaggerated"
4958,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"and misleading, must still reflect in some degree his own experience. No"
4959,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"poem, he asserts, however inspired it may be, is more than a feeble"
4960,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"shadow of the original conception; for when composition begins,"
4961,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,inspiration is already on the decline. And so in a letter he speaks of
4962,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,the detail of execution destroying all wild and beautiful visions.
4963,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Still, inspiration, if diminished by composition, is not wholly"
4964,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,dispelled; and he appeals to the greatest poets of his day whether it is
4965,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,not an error to assert that the finest passages of poetry are produced
4966,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,by labour and study. Such toil he would restrict to those parts which
4967,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"connect the inspired passages, and he speaks with contempt of the"
4968,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,fifty-six various readings of the first line of the _Orlando Furioso_.
4969,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,He seems to exaggerate on this matter because in the _Defence_ his foe
4970,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,is cold reason and calculation. Elsewhere he writes more truly of the
4971,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,original conception as being obscure as well as intense;[2] from which
4972,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"it would seem to follow that the feeble shadow, if darker, is at least"
4973,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"more distinct than the original. He forgets, too, what is certainly the"
4974,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"fact, that the poet in reshaping and correcting is able to revive in"
4975,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,some degree the fire of the first impulse. And we know from himself that
4976,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,his greatest works cost him a severe labour not confined to the
4977,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"execution, while his manuscripts show plenty of various readings, if"
4978,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,never so many as fifty-six in one line.
4979,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
4980,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Still, what he says is highly characteristic of his own practice in"
4981,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"composition. He allowed the rush of his ideas to have its way, without"
4982,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,pausing to complete a troublesome line or to find a word that did not
4983,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,come; and the next day (if ever) he filled up the gaps and smoothed the
4984,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,ragged edges. And the result answers to his theory. Keats was right in
4985,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"telling him that he might be more of an artist. His language, indeed,"
4986,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"unlike Wordsworth's or Byron's, is, in his mature work, always that of a"
4987,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,poet; we never hear his mere speaking voice; but he is frequently
4988,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"diffuse and obscure, and even in fine passages his constructions are"
4989,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,sometimes trailing and amorphous. The glowing metal rushes into the
4990,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,mould so vehemently that it overleaps the bounds and fails to find its
4991,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,way into all the little crevices. But no poetry is more manifestly
4992,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"inspired, and even when it is plainly imperfect it is sometimes so"
4993,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,inspired that it is impossible to wish it changed. It has the rapture of
4994,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the mystic, and that is too rare to lose. Tennyson quaintly said of the"
4995,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,hymn _Life of Life_: 'He seems to go up into the air and burst.' It is
4996,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"true: and, if we are to speak of poems as fireworks, I would not compare"
4997,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,_Life of Life_ with a great set piece of Homer or Shakespeare that
4998,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"illumines the whole sky; but, all the same, there is no more thrilling"
4999,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"sight than the heavenward rush of a rocket, and it bursts at a height no"
5000,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,other fire can reach.
5001,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5002,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,In addition to his praise of inspiration Shelley has some scattered
5003,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,remarks on another point which show the same spirit. He could not bear
5004,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"in poetic language any approach to artifice, or any sign that the writer"
5005,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,had a theory or system of style. He thought Keats's earlier poems faulty
5006,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"in this respect, and there is perhaps a reference to Wordsworth in the"
5007,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,following sentence from the Preface to the _Revolt of Islam_: 'Nor have
5008,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,I permitted any system relating to mere words to divert the attention of
5009,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the reader, from whatever interest I may have succeeded in creating, to"
5010,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"my own ingenuity in contriving,--to disgust him according to the rules"
5011,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,of criticism. I have simply clothed my thoughts in what appeared to me
5012,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,the most obvious and appropriate language. A person familiar with
5013,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"nature, and with the most celebrated productions of the human mind, can"
5014,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"scarcely err in following the instinct, with respect to selection of"
5015,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"language, produced by that familiarity.'[3] His own poetic style"
5016,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,certainly corresponds with his intention. It cannot give the kind of
5017,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,pleasure afforded by what may be called without disparagement a learned
5018,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"and artful style, such as Virgil's or Milton's; but, like the best"
5019,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"writing of Shakespeare and Goethe, it is, with all its individuality,"
5020,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,almost entirely free from mannerism and the other vices of
5021,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"self-consciousness, and appears to flow so directly from the thought"
5022,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,that one is ashamed to admire it for itself. This is equally so whether
5023,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the appropriate style is impassioned and highly figurative, or simple"
5024,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,and even plain. It is indeed in the latter case that Shelley wins his
5025,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"greatest, because most difficult, triumph. In the dialogue part of"
5026,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,_Julian and Maddalo_ he has succeeded remarkably in keeping the style
5027,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"quite close to that of familiar though serious conversation, while"
5028,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,making it nevertheless unmistakably poetic. And the _Cenci_ is an
5029,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,example of a success less complete only because the problem was even
5030,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,harder. The ideal of the style of tragic drama in the nineteenth or
5031,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"twentieth century should surely be, not to reproduce with modifications"
5032,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the style of Shakespeare, but to do what Shakespeare did--to idealise,"
5033,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"without deserting, the language of contemporary speech. Shelley in the"
5034,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,_Cenci_ seems to me to have come nearest to this ideal.
5035,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5036,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5037,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,3.
5038,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5039,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,So much for general exposition. If now we consider more closely what
5040,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Shelley says of the substance of poetry, a question at once arises. He"
5041,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,may seem to think of poetry solely as the direct expression of
5042,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"perfection in some form, and accordingly to imagine its effect as simply"
5043,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"joy or delighted aspiration. Much of his own poetry, too, is such an"
5044,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,expression; and we understand when we find him saying that Homer
5045,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"embodied the ideal perfection of his age in human character, and"
5046,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"unveiled in Achilles, Hector, and Ulysses 'the truth and beauty of"
5047,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"friendship, patriotism, and persevering devotion to an object.' But"
5048,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"poetry, it is obvious, is not wholly, perhaps not even mainly, of this"
5049,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"kind. What is to be said, on Shelley's theory, of his own melancholy"
5050,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"lyrics, those 'sweetest songs' that 'tell of saddest thought'? What of"
5051,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"satire, of the epic of conflict and war, or of tragic exhibitions of"
5052,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,violent and destructive passion? Does not his theory reflect the
5053,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"weakness of his own practice, his tendency to portray a thin and"
5054,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,abstract ideal instead of interpreting the concrete detail of nature and
5055,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,life; and ought we not to oppose to it a theory which would consider
5056,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,poetry simply as a representation of fact?
5057,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5058,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"To this last question I should answer No. Shelley's theory, rightly"
5059,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"understood, will take in, I think, everything really poetic. And to a"
5060,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,considerable extent he himself shows the way to meet these doubts. He
5061,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,did not mean that the _immediate_ subject of poetry must be perfection
5062,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"in some form. The poet, he says, can colour with the hues of the ideal"
5063,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"everything he touches. If so, he may write of absolutely anything so"
5064,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"long as he _can_ so colour it, and nothing would be excluded from his"
5065,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,province except those things (if any such exist) in which no positive
5066,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"relation to the ideal, however indirect, can be shown or intimated. Thus"
5067,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"to take the instance of Shelley's melancholy lyrics, clearly the lament"
5068,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"which arises from loss of the ideal, and mourns the evanescence of its"
5069,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"visitations or the desolation of its absence, is indirectly an"
5070,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,expression _of_ the ideal; and so on his theory is the simplest song of
5071,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"unhappy love or the simplest dirge. Further, he himself observes that,"
5072,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"though the joy of poetry is often unalloyed, yet the pleasure of the"
5073,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,'highest portions of our being is frequently connected with the pain of
5074,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the inferior,' that 'the pleasure that is in sorrow is sweeter than the"
5075,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"pleasure of pleasure itself,' and that not sorrow only, but 'terror,"
5076,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"anguish, despair itself, are often the chosen expressions of an"
5077,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"approximation to the highest good.' That, then, which appeals poetically"
5078,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,to such painful emotions will again be an indirect portrayal of the
5079,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"ideal; and it is clear, I think, that this was how Shelley in the"
5080,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"_Defence_ regarded heroic and tragic poetry, whether narrative or"
5081,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"dramatic, with its manifestly imperfect characters and its exhibition of"
5082,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"conflict and wild passion. He had, it is true, another and an"
5083,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,unsatisfactory way of explaining the presence of these things in poetry;
5084,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,and I will refer to this in a moment. But he tells us that the Athenian
5085,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,tragedies represent the highest idealisms (his name for ideals) of
5086,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,passion and of power (not merely of virtue); and that in them we behold
5087,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"ourselves, 'under a thin disguise of circumstance, stripped of all but"
5088,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,that ideal perfection and energy which every one feels to be the
5089,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"internal type of all that he loves, admires, and would become.' He"
5090,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,writes of Milton's Satan in somewhat the same strain. The Shakespearean
5091,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,tragedy from which he most often quotes is one in which evil holds the
5092,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"stage, _Macbeth_; and he was inclined to think _King Lear_, which"
5093,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"certainly is no direct portrait of perfection, the greatest drama in the"
5094,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"world. Lastly, in the Preface to his own _Cenci_ he truly says that,"
5095,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"while the story is fearful and monstrous, 'the poetry which exists in"
5096,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"these tempestuous sufferings and crimes,' if duly brought out,"
5097,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,'mitigates the pain of the contemplation of moral deformity': so that he
5098,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"regards Count Cenci himself as a _poetic_ character, and therefore as in"
5099,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,_some_ sense an expression of the ideal. He does not further explain his
5100,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,meaning. Perhaps it was that the perfection which poetry is to exhibit
5101,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"includes, together with those qualities which win our immediate and"
5102,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"entire approval or sympathy, others which are capable of becoming the"
5103,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"instruments of evil. For these, the energy, power and passion of the"
5104,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"soul, though they may be perverted, are in themselves elements of"
5105,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"perfection; and so, even in their perversion or their combination with"
5106,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"moral deformity, they retain their value, they are not simply ugly or"
5107,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"horrible, but appeal through emotions predominantly painful to the same"
5108,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,love of the ideal which is directly satisfied by pictures of goodness
5109,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,and beauty. Now to these various considerations we shall wish to add
5110,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"others; but if we bear these in mind, I believe we shall find Shelley's"
5111,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"theory wide enough, and must hold that the substance of poetry is never"
5112,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"mere fact, but is always ideal, though its method of representation is"
5113,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"sometimes more direct, sometimes more indirect."
5114,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5115,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Nevertheless, he does not seem to have made his view quite clear to"
5116,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"himself, or to hold to it consistently. We are left with the impression,"
5117,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"not merely that he personally preferred the direct method (as he was, of"
5118,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"course, entitled to do), but that his use of it shows a certain"
5119,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"weakness, and also that even in theory he unconsciously tends to regard"
5120,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"it as the primary and proper method, and to admit only by a reluctant"
5121,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,after-thought the representation of imperfection. Let me point out some
5122,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,signs of this. He considered his own _Cenci_ as a poem inferior in kind
5123,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"to his other main works, even as a sort of accommodation to the public."
5124,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,With all his modesty he knew what to think of the neglected
5125,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"_Prometheus_ and _Adonaïs_, but there is no sign that he, any more than"
5126,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the world, was aware that the character of Cenci was a creation without"
5127,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,a parallel in our poetry since the seventeenth century. His enthusiasm
5128,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"for some second-rate and third-rate Italian paintings, and his failure"
5129,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"to understand Michael Angelo, seem to show the same tendency. He could"
5130,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,not enjoy comedy: it seemed to him simply cruel: he did not perceive
5131,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,that to show the absurdity of the imperfect is to glorify the perfect.
5132,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"And, as I mentioned just now, he wavers in his view of the"
5133,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,representation of heroic and tragic imperfection. We find in the Preface
5134,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,to _Prometheus Unbound_ the strange notion that Prometheus is a more
5135,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,poetic character than Milton's Satan because he is free from Satan's
5136,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"imperfections, which are said to interfere with the interest. And in the"
5137,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"_Defence_ a similar error appears. Achilles, Hector, Ulysses, though"
5138,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"they exhibit ideal virtues, are, he admits, imperfect. Why, then, did"
5139,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Homer make them so? Because, he seems to reply, Homer's contemporaries"
5140,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,regarded their vices (_e.g._ revengefulness and deceitfulness) as
5141,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,virtues. Homer accordingly had to conceal in the costume of these vices
5142,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the unspotted beauty that he himself imagined; and, like Homer, 'few"
5143,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,poets of the highest class have chosen to exhibit the beauty of their
5144,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"conceptions in its naked truth and splendour.' Now, this idea, to say"
5145,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"nothing of its grotesque improbability in reference to Homer, and its"
5146,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"probable baselessness in reference to most other poets, is quite"
5147,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,inconsistent with that truer view of heroic and tragic character which
5148,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,was explained just now. It is an example of Shelley's tendency to
5149,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,abstract idealism or spurious Platonism. He is haunted by the fancy that
5150,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"if he could only get at the One, the eternal Idea, in complete aloofness"
5151,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"from the Many, from life with all its change, decay, struggle, sorrow"
5152,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"and evil, he would have reached the true object of poetry: as if the"
5153,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"whole finite world were a mere mistake or illusion, the sheer opposite"
5154,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"of the infinite One, and in no way or degree its manifestation. Life, he"
5155,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,says--
5156,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5157,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,"
5158,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,Stains the white radiance of eternity;
5159,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5160,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"but the other side, the fact that the many colours _are_ the white light"
5161,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"broken, he tends to forget, by no means always, but in one, and that not"
5162,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the least inspired, of his moods. This is the source of that thinness"
5163,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,and shallowness of which his view of the world and of history is justly
5164,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"accused, a view in which all imperfect being is apt to figure as"
5165,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"absolutely gratuitous, and everything and everybody as pure white or"
5166,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"pitch black. Hence also his ideals of good, whether as a character or as"
5167,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"a mode of life, resting as they do on abstraction from the mass of real"
5168,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"existence, tend to lack body and individuality; and indeed, if the"
5169,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"existence of the many is a mere calamity, clearly the next best thing to"
5170,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,their disappearance is that they should all be exactly alike and have as
5171,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,little character as possible. But we must remember that Shelley's
5172,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"strength and weakness are closely allied, and it may be that the very"
5173,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,abstractness of his ideal was a condition of that quivering intensity of
5174,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,aspiration towards it in which his poetry is unequalled. We must not go
5175,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,for this to Homer and Shakespeare and Goethe; and if we go for it to
5176,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Dante, we shall find, indeed, a mind far vaster than Shelley's, but also"
5177,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"that dualism of which we complain in him, and the description of a"
5178,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"heaven which, equally with Shelley's regenerated earth, is no place for"
5179,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"mere mortality. In any case, as we have seen, the weakness in his"
5180,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"poetical practice, though it occasionally appears also as a defect in"
5181,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"his poetical theory, forms no necessary part of it."
5182,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5183,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5184,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,4.
5185,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5186,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,I pass to his views on a last point. If the business of poetry is
5187,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"somehow to express ideal perfection, it may seem to follow that the"
5188,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,poet should embody in his poems his beliefs about this perfection and
5189,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the way to approach it, and should thus have a moral purpose and aim to"
5190,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,be a teacher. And in regard to Shelley this conclusion seems the more
5191,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,natural because his own poetry allows us to see clearly some of his
5192,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,beliefs about morality and moral progress. Yet alike in his Prefaces and
5193,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,in the _Defence_ he takes up most decidedly the position that the poet
5194,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,ought neither to affect a moral aim nor to express his own conceptions
5195,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"of right and wrong. 'Didactic poetry,' he declares, 'is my abhorrence:"
5196,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and
5197,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"supererogatory in verse.'[4] 'There was little danger,' he tells us in"
5198,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the _Defence_, 'that Homer or any of the eternal poets' should make a"
5199,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"mistake in this matter; but 'those in whom the poetical faculty, though"
5200,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"great, is less intense, as Euripides, Lucan, Tasso, Spenser, have"
5201,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"frequently affected a moral aim, and the effect of their poetry is"
5202,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,diminished in exact proportion to the degree in which they compel us to
5203,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"advert to this purpose.' These statements may appeal to us, but are they"
5204,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,consistent with Shelley's main views of poetry? To answer this question
5205,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,we must observe what exactly it is that he means to condemn.
5206,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5207,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,Shelley was one of the few persons who can literally be said to _love_
5208,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"their kind. He held most strongly, too, that poetry does benefit men,"
5209,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"and benefits them morally. The moral purpose, then, to which he objects"
5210,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,cannot well be a poet's general purpose of doing moral as well as other
5211,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"good through his poetry--such a purpose, I mean, as he may cherish when"
5212,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"he contemplates his life and his life's work. And, indeed, it seems"
5213,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"obvious that nobody with any humanity or any sense can object to that,"
5214,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"except through some intellectual confusion. Nor, secondly, does Shelley"
5215,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"mean, I think, to condemn even the writing of a particular poem with a"
5216,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"view to a particular moral or practical effect; certainly, at least, if"
5217,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"this was his meaning he was condemning some of his own poetry. Nor,"
5218,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"thirdly, can he be referring to the portrayal of moral ideals; for that"
5219,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"he regarded as one of the main functions of poetry, and in the very"
5220,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"place where he says that didactic poetry is his abhorrence he also says,"
5221,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"by way of contrast, that he has tried to familiarise the minds of his"
5222,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence. It appears,"
5223,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"therefore, that what he is really attacking is the attempt to give, in"
5224,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the strict sense, moral _instruction_, to communicate doctrines, to"
5225,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"offer argumentative statements of opinion on right and wrong, and more"
5226,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"especially, I think, on controversial questions of the day. An example"
5227,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,would be Wordsworth's discourse on education at the end of the
5228,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"_Excursion_, a discourse of which Shelley, we know, had a very low"
5229,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"opinion. In short, his enemy is not the purpose of producing a moral"
5230,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"effect, it is the appeal made for this purpose to the reasoning"
5231,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,intellect. He says to the poet: By all means aim at bettering men; you
5232,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"are a man, and are bound to do so; but you are also a poet, and"
5233,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,therefore your proper way of doing so is not by reasoning and preaching.
5234,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"His idea is of a piece with his general championship of imagination, and"
5235,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,it is quite consistent with his main view of poetry.[5]
5236,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5237,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"What, then, are the _grounds_ of this position? They are not clearly set"
5238,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"out, but we can trace several, and they are all solid. Reasoning on"
5239,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"moral subjects, moral philosophy, was by no means 'tedious' to Shelley;"
5240,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"it seldom is to real poets. He loved it, and (outside his _Defence_) he"
5241,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,rated its value very high.[6] But he thought it tedious and out of place
5242,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"in poetry, because it can be equally well expressed in 'unmeasured'"
5243,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"language--much better expressed, one may venture to add. You invent an"
5244,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,art in order to effect by it a particular purpose which nothing else can
5245,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"effect as well. How foolish, then, to use this art for a purpose better"
5246,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"served by something else! I know no answer to this argument, and its"
5247,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"application is far wider than that given to it by Shelley. Secondly,"
5248,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,Shelley remarks that a poet's own conceptions on moral subjects are
5249,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"usually those of his place and time, while the matter of his poem ought"
5250,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"to be eternal, or, as we say, of permanent and universal interest. This,"
5251,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"again, seems true, and has a wide application; and it holds good even"
5252,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"when the poet, like Shelley himself, is in rebellion against orthodox"
5253,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,moral opinion; for his heterodox opinions will equally show the marks of
5254,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"his place and time, and constitute a perishable element in his work."
5255,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,Doubtless no poetry can be without a perishable element; but that poetry
5256,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,has least of it which interprets life least through the medium of
5257,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,systematic and doctrinal ideas. The veil which time and place have hung
5258,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,between Homer or Shakespeare and the general reader of to-day is almost
5259,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"transparent, while even a poetry so intense as that of Dante and Milton"
5260,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"is impeded in its passage to him by systems which may be unfamiliar,"
5261,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"and, if familiar, may be distasteful."
5262,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5263,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,Lastly--and this is Shelley's central argument--as poetry itself is
5264,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"directly due to imaginative inspiration and not to reasoning, so its"
5265,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,true moral effect is produced through imagination and not through
5266,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"doctrine. Imagination is, for Shelley, 'the great instrument of moral"
5267,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,good.' The 'secret of morals is love.' It is not 'for want of admirable
5268,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,doctrines that men hate and despise and censure and deceive and
5269,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,subjugate one another': it is for want of love. And love is 'a going out
5270,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"of our own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the beautiful"
5271,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"which exists in thought, action or person not our own.' 'A man,'"
5272,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"therefore, 'to be greatly good must imagine intensely and"
5273,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"comprehensively.' And poetry ministers to moral good, the effect, by"
5274,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"acting on its cause, imagination. It strengthens imagination as exercise"
5275,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"strengthens a limb, and so it indirectly promotes morality. It also"
5276,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,fills the imagination with beautiful impersonations of all that we
5277,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"should wish to be. But moral reasoning does not act upon the cause, it"
5278,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,only analyses the effect; and the poet has no right to be content to
5279,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"analyse what he ought indirectly to create. Here, again, in his"
5280,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"eagerness, Shelley cuts his antitheses too clean, but the defect is"
5281,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"easily made good, and the main argument is sound."
5282,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5283,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,Limits of time will compel me to be guilty of the same fault in adding a
5284,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,consideration which is in the spirit of Shelley's. The chief moral
5285,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"effect claimed for poetry by Shelley is exerted, primarily, by"
5286,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"imagination on the emotions; but there is another influence, exerted"
5287,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,primarily through imagination on the understanding. Poetry is largely an
5288,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"interpretation of life; and, considering what life is, that must mean a"
5289,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"moral interpretation. This, to have poetic value, must satisfy"
5290,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"imagination; but we value it also because it gives us knowledge, a wider"
5291,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"comprehension, a new insight into ourselves and the world.[7] Now, it"
5292,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,may be held--and this view answers to a very general feeling among
5293,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,lovers of poetry now--that the most deep and original moral
5294,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,interpretation is not likely to be that which most shows a moral purpose
5295,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"or is most governed by reflective beliefs and opinions, and that as a"
5296,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"rule we learn most from those who do not try to teach us, and whose"
5297,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,opinions may even remain unknown to us: so that there is this weighty
5298,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"objection to the appearance of such purpose and opinions, that it tends"
5299,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,to defeat its own intention. And the reason that I wish to suggest is
5300,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"this, that always we get most from the _genius_ in a man of genius and"
5301,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"not from the rest of him. Now, although poets often have unusual powers"
5302,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"of reflective thought, the specific genius of a poet does not lie there,"
5303,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,but in imagination. Therefore his deepest and most original
5304,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,interpretation is likely to come by the way of imagination. And the
5305,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,specific way of imagination is not to clothe in imagery consciously held
5306,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"ideas; it is to produce half-consciously a matter from which, when"
5307,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"produced, the reader may, if he chooses, extract ideas. Poetry (I must"
5308,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"exaggerate to be clear), psychologically considered, is not the"
5309,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,_expression_ of ideas or of a view of life; it is their discovery or
5310,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"creation, or rather both discovery and creation in one. The"
5311,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,interpretation contained in _Hamlet_ or _King Lear_ was not brought
5312,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,ready-made to the old stories. What was brought to them was the huge
5313,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"substance of Shakespeare's imagination, in which all his experience and"
5314,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"thought was latent; and this, dwelling and working on the stories with"
5315,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"nothing but a dramatic purpose, and kindling into heat and motion,"
5316,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,gradually discovered or created in them a meaning and a mass of truth
5317,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"about life, which was brought to birth by the process of composition,"
5318,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"but never preceded it in the shape of ideas, and probably never, even"
5319,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"after it, took that shape to the poet's mind. And _this_ is the"
5320,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"interpretation which we find inexhaustibly instructive, because"
5321,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Shakespeare's _genius_ is in it. On the other hand, however much from"
5322,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,curiosity and personal feeling towards him we may wish to know his
5323,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,opinions and beliefs about morals or religion or his own poems or Queen
5324,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Elizabeth, we have not really any reason to suppose that their value"
5325,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"would prove extraordinary. And so, to apply this generally, the"
5326,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"opinions, reasonings and beliefs of poets are seldom of the same quality"
5327,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"as their purely imaginative product. Occasionally, as with Goethe, they"
5328,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,are not far off it; but sometimes they are intense without being
5329,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"profound, and more eccentric than original; and often they are very sane"
5330,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"and sound, but not very different from those of wise men without genius."
5331,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,And therefore poetry is not the place for them. For we want in poetry a
5332,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"moral interpretation, but not the interpretation we have already. As a"
5333,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,rule the genuine artist's quarrel with 'morality' in art is not really
5334,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"with morality, it is with a stereotyped or narrow morality; and when he"
5335,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,refuses in his art to consider things from what he calls the moral point
5336,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"of view, his reasons are usually wrong, but his instinct is right."
5337,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,
5338,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Poetry itself confirms on the whole this contention, though doubtless in"
5339,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,these last centuries a great poet's work will usually reveal more of
5340,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,conscious reflection than once it did. Homer and Shakespeare show no
5341,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,moral aim and no system of opinion. Milton was far from justifying the
5342,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,ways of God to men by the argumentation he put into divine and angelic
5343,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,lips; his truer moral insight is in the creations of his genius; for
5344,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"instance, in the character of Satan or the picture of the glorious"
5345,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,humanity of Adam and Eve. Goethe himself could never have told the world
5346,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,what he was going to express in the First Part of _Faust_: the poem told
5347,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"_him_, and it is one of the world's greatest. He knew too well what he"
5348,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"was going to express in the Second Part, and with all its wisdom and"
5349,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,beauty it is scarcely a great poem. Wordsworth's original message was
5350,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"delivered, not when he was a Godwinian semi-atheist, nor when he had"
5351,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"subsided upon orthodoxy, but when his imagination, with a few hints from"
5352,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Coleridge, was creating a kind of natural religion; and this religion"
5353,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,itself is more profoundly expressed in his descriptions of his
5354,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,experience than in his attempts to formulate it. The moral virtue of
5355,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Tennyson is in poems like _Ulysses_ and parts of _In Memoriam_, where"
5356,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,sorrow and the consciousness of a deathless affection or an unquenchable
5357,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,desire for experience forced an utterance; but when in the _Idylls_ he
5358,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,tried to found a great poem on explicit ideas about the soul and the
5359,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"ravages wrought in it by lawless passion, he succeeded but partially,"
5360,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"because these ideas, however sound, were no product of his genius. And"
5361,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"so the moral virtue of Shelley's poetry lay, not in his doctrines about"
5362,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"the past and future of man, but in an intuition, which was the substance"
5363,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"of his soul, of the unique value of love. In the end, for him, the"
5364,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"truest name of that perfection called Intellectual Beauty, Liberty,"
5365,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,"Spirit of Nature, is Love. Whatever in the world has any worth is an"
5366,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,expression of Love. Love sometimes talks. Love talking musically is
5367,SHELLEY'S VIEW OF POETRY,Poetry.

5436,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"The poetry of the age of Wordsworth, we are all agreed, is one of the"
5437,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"glories of our literature. It is surpassed, many would add, by the"
5438,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],poetry of no other period except the Elizabethan. But it has obvious
5439,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"flaws, of which perhaps we are becoming more and more distinctly"
5440,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"conscious now; and, apart from these definite defects, it also leaves"
5441,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"with us, when we review it, a certain feeling of disappointment. It is"
5442,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"great, we say to ourselves, but why is it not greater still? It shows a"
5443,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],wonderful abundance of genius: why does it not show an equal
5444,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],accomplishment?
5445,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],

5447,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],1.
5448,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5449,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Matthew Arnold, in his essay on _The Function of Criticism at the"
5450,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Present Time_, gave an answer to this question. 'It has long seemed to"
5451,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"me,' he wrote, 'that the burst of creative activity in our literature,"
5452,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"through the first quarter of this century, had about it, in fact,"
5453,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],something premature.... And this prematureness comes from its having
5454,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"proceeded without having its proper data, without sufficient materials"
5455,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"to work with. In other words, the English poetry of the first quarter of"
5456,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"this century, with plenty of energy, plenty of creative force, did not"
5457,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"know enough. This makes Byron so empty of matter, Shelley so incoherent,"
5458,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth even, profound as he is, yet so wanting in completeness and"
5459,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"in variety.' The statement that this poetry 'did not know enough' means,"
5460,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"of course, for Arnold, not that it lacked information, reading, ideas of"
5461,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"a kind, but that it lacked 'criticism.' And this means that it did not"
5462,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"live and move freely in an atmosphere of the best available ideas, of"
5463,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"ideas gained by a free, sincere, and continued effort, in theology,"
5464,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"philosophy, history, science, to see things as they are. In such an"
5465,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"atmosphere Goethe lived. There was not indeed in Goethe's Germany, nor"
5466,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"was there in the England of our poets, the 'national glow of life and"
5467,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],thought' that prevailed in the Athens of Pericles or the England of
5468,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Elizabeth. That happiest atmosphere for poetry was wanting in both
5469,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],countries. But there was for Goethe 'a sort of equivalent for it in the
5470,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"complete culture and unfettered thinking of a large body of Germans,' a"
5471,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],culture produced by a many-sided learning and a long and widely-combined
5472,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],critical effort. It was this that our poets lacked.
5473,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5474,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Now, if this want existed, as Arnold affirms, it may not have had all"
5475,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the importance he ascribes to it, but considerable importance it must"
5476,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],have had. And as to its existence there can hardly be a doubt. One of
5477,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],the most striking characteristics of Wordsworth's age is the very
5478,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],unusual superiority of the imaginative literature to the scientific. I
5479,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"mean by the 'scientific' literature that of philosophy, theology,"
5480,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"history, politics, economics, not only that of the sciences of Nature,"
5481,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],which for our present purpose are perhaps the least important. In this
5482,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],kind of literature Wordsworth's age has hardly an author to show who
5483,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"could for a moment be placed on a level with some five of the poets,"
5484,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"with the novelists Scott and Jane Austen, or with the poetic critics"
5485,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Lamb, Hazlitt, and Coleridge. It has no writers to compare with Bacon,"
5486,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Newton, Hume, Gibbon, Johnson, or Burke. It is the time of Paley,"
5487,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Godwin, Stewart, Bentham, Mitford, Lingard, Coleridge the philosopher"
5488,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"and theologian. These are names worthy of all respect, but they"
5489,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],represent a literature quite definitely of the second rank. And this
5490,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"great disproportion between the two kinds of literature, we must"
5491,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"observe, is a peculiar phenomenon. If we go back as far as the"
5492,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Elizabethan age we shall find no parallel to it. The one kind was
5493,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"doubtless superior to the other in Shakespeare's time, possibly even in"
5494,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Milton's; but Hooker and Bacon and Taylor and Clarendon and Hobbes are
5495,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],not separated from the best poets of their day by any startling
5496,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"difference of quality;[2] while in the later periods, right down to the"
5497,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"age of Wordsworth, the scientific literature quite holds its own, to say"
5498,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"no more, with the imaginative. Nor in the Germany of Wordsworth's own"
5499,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],time is there that gap between the two that we find in England. In
5500,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"respect of genius the philosophers, for example, though none of them was"
5501,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the equal of Goethe, were as a body not at all inferior to the poets."
5502,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],The case of England in Wordsworth's age is anomalous.
5503,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5504,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"This peculiarity must be symptomatic, and it must have been influential."
5505,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],It confirms Arnold's view that the intellectual atmosphere of the time
5506,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],was not of the best. If we think of the periodical literature--of the
5507,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],_Quarterly_ and _Edinburgh_ and _Blackwood_--we shall be still more
5508,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],inclined to assent to that view. And when we turn to the poets
5509,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"themselves, and especially to their prose writings, letters, and"
5510,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"recorded conversation, and even to the critiques of Hazlitt, of Lamb,"
5511,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"and of Coleridge, we cannot reject it. Assuredly we read with"
5512,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"admiration, and the signs of native genius we meet with in abundance--in"
5513,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"greater abundance, I think, than in the poetry and criticism of Germany,"
5514,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"if Goethe is excepted. But the freedom of spirit, the knowledge, the"
5515,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"superiority to prejudice and caprice and fanaticism, the openness to"
5516,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"ideas, the atmosphere that is all about us when we read Lessing, Goethe,"
5517,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Schiller, Heine, we do not find. Can we imagine any one of those four"
5518,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],either inspired or imprisoned as Shelley was by the doctrines of Godwin?
5519,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Could any of them have seen in the French Revolution no more
5520,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],significance than Scott appears to have detected? How cramped are the
5521,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"attitudes, sympathetic or antipathetic, of nearly all our poets towards"
5522,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],the Christian religion! Could anything be more _borné_ than Coleridge's
5523,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],professed reason for not translating _Faust_?[3] Is it possible that a
5524,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],German poet with the genius of Byron or Wordsworth could have inhabited
5525,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],a mental world so small and so tainted with vulgarity as is opened to us
5526,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"by the brilliant letters of the former, or could have sunk, like the"
5527,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"latter, to suggesting that the cholera was a divine condemnation of"
5528,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Catholic Emancipation and the Reform Bill?
5529,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5530,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],But if we accept Arnold's statement as to the intellectual atmosphere of
5531,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the poetry of Wordsworth's time, a question will remain. Was he right in"
5532,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"regarding this atmosphere as the sole, or even as the chief, cause of"
5533,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],the fact (if it is one) that the poetry does not fully correspond in
5534,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],greatness with the genius of the poets? And before we come to this
5535,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],question we must put another. Is the fact really as it has just been
5536,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"stated? I do not think so. The disappointment that we feel attends, it"
5537,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"seems to me, mainly our reading of the long poems. Reviewing these in"
5538,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"memory, and asking ourselves how many we can unreservedly call 'great,'"
5539,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"we hesitate. Beyond doubt there is great poetry in some of them, fine"
5540,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],poetry in many; but that does not make a great whole. Which of them is
5541,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"great as a whole? Not the _Prelude_ or the _Excursion_, still less"
5542,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"_Endymion_ or _The Revolt of Islam_ or _Childe Harold_, which hardly"
5543,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"pretends to unity. _Christabel_, the wonderful fragment, is a fragment;"
5544,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"so is _Hyperion_; _Don Juan_, also unfinished, becomes more discursive"
5545,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the further it proceeds, and in spirit is nowhere great. All the"
5546,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"principal poets wrote dramas, or at least dramatic pieces; and some"
5547,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"readers think that in _Manfred_, and still more certainly in _Cain_, we"
5548,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"have great poems, while others think this of _Prometheus Unbound_ and"
5549,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"_The Cenci_. But if as to one or more of these we assent, is our"
5550,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"judgment quite confident, and can we say that any of them _satisfy_ us,"
5551,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"like some works of earlier times? We are thus satisfied, it seems to me,"
5552,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"only when we come to poems of smaller dimensions, like _The Ancient"
5553,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Mariner_, or _The Eve of Saint Agnes_, or _Adonaïs_, or _The Vision of"
5554,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Judgment_, or when we read the lyrics. To save time I will confine"
5555,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],myself to the latter.
5556,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5557,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Within this sphere we have no longer that impression of genius which
5558,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"fails to reach full accomplishment. I would go further. No poet, of"
5559,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"course, of Wordsworth's age is the equal of Shakespeare or of Milton;"
5560,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"and there are certain qualities, too, of lyrical verse in which the"
5561,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],times of Shakespeare and of Milton are superior to that of Wordsworth.
5562,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],But if we take the better part of the lyrical poetry of these three
5563,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"periods in the mass, or again in a representative selection, it will not"
5564,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"be the latest period, I think, that need fear the comparison. In the"
5565,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"original edition of the _Golden Treasury_, Book I. (Wyatt to"
5566,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Shakespeare) occupies forty pages; Book II. (the rest of the seventeenth
5567,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"century) sixty-five; Book IV., which covers the very much shorter"
5568,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"period from Wordsworth to Hood, close on a hundred and forty. 'Book"
5569,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"I.,' perhaps most of us would say, 'should be longer, and Book IV. a"
5570,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"good deal shorter: some third-rate pieces are included in it, and"
5571,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Wordsworth is over-represented. And the Elizabethan poems are mostly
5572,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"quite short, while the Nineteenth Century poets shine equally in the"
5573,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"longer kinds of lyric. And Mr. Palgrave excluded the old ballads, but"
5574,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],admitted poems like Coleridge's _Love_ and Wordsworth's _Ruth_ (seven
5575,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],whole pages). And in any case we cannot judge by mere quantity.' No; but
5576,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"still quantity must count for something, and the _Golden Treasury_ is a"
5577,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"volume excellent in selection, arrangement, and taste. It does, I think,"
5578,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],leave the impression that the age of Wordsworth was our greatest period
5579,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],in lyrical poetry. And if Book I. were swelled to the dimensions of Book
5580,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"IV., this impression would not be materially altered; it might even be"
5581,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],deepened. For the change would force into notice the comparative
5582,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"monotony of the themes of the earlier poetry, and the immensely wider"
5583,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],range of the thought and emotion that attain expression in the later. It
5584,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"might also convince us that, on the whole, this more varied material is"
5585,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"treated with a greater intensity of feeling, though on this point it is"
5586,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"difficult to be sure, since we recognise what may be called the"
5587,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"conventions of an earlier age, and are perhaps a little blind to those"
5588,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],of a time near our own.
5589,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5590,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Now the eminence of Wordsworth's age in lyrical poetry, even if it is"
5591,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"not also a pre-eminence, is a significant fact. It may mean that the"
5592,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],whole poetic spirit of the time was lyrical in tendency; and this may
5593,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],indirectly be a cause of that sense of disappointment which mingles with
5594,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"our admiration of the long poems. I will call attention, therefore, to"
5595,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],two or three allied facts. (1) The longer poems of Campbell are already
5596,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],dead; he survives only in lyrics. This is also true of Moore. In spite
5597,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],of fine passages (and the battle in _Marmion_ is in certain qualities
5598,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],superior to anything else of the time) Scott's longer poems cannot be
5599,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],classed with the best contemporary poetry; but in some of his ballads
5600,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"and songs he attains that rank. (2) Again, much of the most famous"
5601,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"narrative poetry is semi-lyrical in form, as a moment's thought of"
5602,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Scott, Byron, and Coleridge will show. Some of it (for instance, several"
5603,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"of Byron's tales, or Wordsworth's _White Doe of Rylstone_) is strongly"
5604,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],tinged with the lyrical spirit. The centre of interest is inward. It is
5605,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"an interest in emotion, thought, will, rather than in scenes, events,"
5606,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"actions, which express and re-act on emotions, thoughts, will. It would"
5607,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],hardly be going too far to say that in the most characteristic narrative
5608,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],poetry the balance of outward and inward is rarely attained.[4] (3) The
5609,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],same tendencies are visible in much of the dramatic writing. Byron's
5610,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"regular dramas, for instance, if they ever lived, are almost forgotten;"
5611,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"but _Heaven and Earth_, which is still alive, is largely composed of"
5612,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"lyrics, and the first two acts of _Manfred_ are full of them."
5613,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],_Prometheus Unbound_ is called 'a lyrical drama.' Though it has some
5614,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],very fine and some very beautiful blank verse passages (usually
5615,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"undramatic), its lyrics are its glory; and this is even more the case"
5616,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],with _Hellas_. It would be untrue to say that the comparative failure of
5617,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"most of the dramas of the time is principally due to the lyrical spirit,"
5618,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],but many of them show it. (4) The strength of this spirit may be
5619,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],illustrated lastly by a curious fact. The ode is one of the longest and
5620,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"most ambitious forms of lyric, and some of the most famous poems of"
5621,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats are odes. But the greatest of the"
5622,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"lyrists, who wrote the Odes to Liberty and Naples and the West Wind,"
5623,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],found the limits even of the ode too narrow for his 'flight of fire.' If
5624,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],_Lycidas_ and _L'Allegro_ and Spenser's _Epithalamion_ are lyrical
5625,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"poems, and if we are not arbitrarily to determine that nothing shall be"
5626,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"called lyrical which exceeds a certain length, _Adonaïs_ will be a"
5627,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"lyrical elegy in fifty-five Spenserian stanzas, and the _Lines written"
5628,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],among the Euganean Hills_ and _Epipsychidion_ will be lyrics consisting
5629,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],respectively of 370 and 600 lines.
5630,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5631,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],It will however be agreed that in general a lyrical poem may be called
5632,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"short as compared with a narrative or drama. It is usual, further, to"
5633,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"say that lyrical poetry is 'subjective,' since, instead of telling or"
5634,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"representing a story of people, actions, and events, it expresses the"
5635,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],thoughts and feelings of the poet himself. This statement is ambiguous
5636,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],and in other ways defective; but it will be admitted to have a basis in
5637,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"fact. It may be suggested, then, that the excellence of the lyrical"
5638,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"poetry of Wordsworth's time, and the imperfection of the long narratives"
5639,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"and dramas, may have a common origin. Just as it was most natural to"
5640,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Homer or to Shakespeare to express the imaginative substance of his mind
5641,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],in the 'objective' shape of a world of persons and actions ostensibly
5642,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"severed from his own thoughts and feelings, so, perhaps, for some reason"
5643,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"or reasons, it was most natural to the best poets of this later time to"
5644,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"express that substance in the shape of impassioned reflections,"
5645,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"aspirations, prophecies, laments, outcries of joy, murmurings of peace."
5646,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"The matter of these might, in another sense of the word, be 'objective'"
5647,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"enough, a matter of general human interest, not personal in any"
5648,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],exclusive way; but it appeared in the form of the poet's thought and
5649,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"feeling. Just because he most easily expressed it thus, he succeeded"
5650,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],less completely when he attempted the more objective form of utterance;
5651,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],and for the same reason it was especially important that he should be
5652,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"surrounded and penetrated by an atmosphere of wide, deep, and liberal"
5653,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"'criticism.' For he not only lived among ideas; he expressed ideas, and"
5654,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],expressed them _as_ ideas.
5655,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5656,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],These suggestions seem to be supported by other phenomena of the poetry.
5657,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"The 'subjective' spirit extends, we saw, into many of the longer poems."
5658,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"This is obvious when it can plausibly be said, as in Byron's case, that"
5659,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the poet's one hero is himself. It appears in another way when the poem,"
5660,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"through its story or stories, displays the poet's favourite ideas and"
5661,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],beliefs. The _Excursion_ does this; most of Shelley's longer poems do
5662,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],it. And the strength of this tendency may be seen in an apparent
5663,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],contradiction. One of the marks of the Romantic Revival is a disposition
5664,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],to substitute the more concrete and vivid forms of narrative and drama
5665,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],for the eighteenth century form of satiric or so-called didactic
5666,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"reflection. Yet most of the greater poets, especially in their"
5667,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"characteristic beginnings, show a strong tendency to reflective verse;"
5668,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Coleridge, for example, in _Religious Musings_, Byron in the first two"
5669,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"cantos of _Childe Harold_, Shelley in _Queen Mab_, and Keats in _Sleep"
5670,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"and Poetry_. These are not, like the _Pleasures of Memory_ and"
5671,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"_Pleasures of Hope_, continuations of the traditional style; they are"
5672,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"thoroughly Romantic; and yet they are reflective. Scott, indeed, goes"
5673,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"straight to the objective forms; but then Scott, for good and evil, was"
5674,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],little affected by the spiritual upheaval of his time. Those who were
5675,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"deeply affected by it, directly or indirectly, had their minds full of"
5676,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"theoretic ideas. They were groping after, or were already inflamed by,"
5677,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"some explicit view of life, and of life seen in relation to an ideal"
5678,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"which it revealed or contradicted. And this view of life, at least at"
5679,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"first, pressed for utterance in a more or less abstract shape, or"
5680,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],became a sort of soul or second meaning within those appearances of
5681,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"nature, or actions of men, or figures and fantasies of youthful"
5682,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"imagination, which formed the ostensible subject of the poetry."
5683,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5684,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Considered in this light, the following facts become very significant."
5685,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth, now about thirty, and the author of many characteristic"
5686,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"lyrics, on returning from Germany and settling at Grasmere, begins to"
5687,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],meditate a long poem. He tells us in the _Prelude_ of the subjects he
5688,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"thought of. They are good subjects, legendary and historical, stories of"
5689,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"action, not at all theoretical.[5] But it will not do: his mind 'turns"
5690,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"recreant to her task.' He has another hope, a 'favourite aspiration'"
5691,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],towards 'a philosophic song of Truth.' But even this will not do; it is
5692,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],premature; even Truth (I venture to suggest) is not inward enough. He
5693,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],must first tell the story of his own mind: the subject of his long poem
5694,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"must be Poetry itself. He tells this story, to our great gain, in the"
5695,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],_Prelude_; and it is the story of the steps by which he came to see
5696,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"reality, Nature and Man, as the partial expression of the ideal, of an"
5697,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],all-embracing and perfect spiritual life or Being. Not till this is done
5698,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"can he proceed to the _Excursion_, which, together with much reflection"
5699,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"and even argumentation, contains pictures of particular men."
5700,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5701,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],'This for our greatest'; but it is not his history alone. The first
5702,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],longer poem of Shelley which can be called mature was _Alastor_. And
5703,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],what is its subject? The subject of the _Prelude_; the story of a Poet's
5704,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"soul, and of the effect on it of the revelation of its ideal. The first"
5705,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],long poem of Keats was _Endymion_. The tendency to the concrete was
5706,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"strong in Keats; he has been called, I think, an Elizabethan born out of"
5707,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"due time; and _Endymion_, like _Venus and Adonis_, is a mythological"
5708,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],story. But it is by no means that alone. The infection of his time was
5709,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],in him. The further subject of _Endymion_ is again the subject of the
5710,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"_Prelude_, the story of a poet's soul smitten by love of its ideal, the"
5711,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Principle of Beauty, and striving for union with it, for the 'wedding'"
5712,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],of the mind of man 'with this goodly universe in love and holy passion.'
5713,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"What, again, is the subject of _Epipsychidion_? The same."
5714,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5715,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],There was a Being whom my spirit oft
5716,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Met on its visioned wanderings, far aloft"
5717,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],In the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn.
5718,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5719,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],The poem is all about the search of the poet's soul for this ideal
5720,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Being. And the _Sensitive Plant_ is this soul, and the Lady of the"
5721,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Garden this Being, And _Prince Athanase_ is the same soul, and if the"
5722,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],poem had been continued the Being would soon have appeared. Is it not an
5723,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],astonishing proof of Shelley's powers that the _Cenci_ was ever written?
5724,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Shelley, when he died, had half escaped--Keats, some time before he"
5725,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"died, had quite escaped--from that bewitching inward world of the poet's"
5726,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],soul and its shadowy adventures. Could that well be the world of what we
5727,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],call emphatically a 'great poem'?
5728,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5729,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5730,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],2.
5731,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5732,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Let us review for a moment the course of our discussion. I have been
5733,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"suggesting that, if our pleasure and glory in the poetry of Wordsworth's"
5734,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"age is tinged with disappointment, this does not extend to the lyrical"
5735,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"poetry; that the lyrical spirit, or, more generally, an inward or"
5736,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"subjective tendency, shows itself in many of the longer works; and that"
5737,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"their imperfection is partly due to it. Now, let me suggest that the"
5738,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],atmosphere of adequate 'criticism' which Arnold misses in the age and
5739,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"its poetry, while doubtless it would have influenced favourably even the"
5740,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"lyrics, and much more the larger works, could hardly have diminished the"
5741,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"force of that tendency, and that the main difficulty lay _there_. But,"
5742,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"before developing this idea further, I propose to leave for a time the"
5743,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"English poetry of Wordsworth's age, to look beyond it, and to ask"
5744,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],certain questions.
5745,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5746,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"First, granted that in that age the atmosphere of 'criticism' was more"
5747,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"favourable in Germany than in England, how many long poems were produced"
5748,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],in Germany that we can call without hesitation or qualification 'great'?
5749,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Were _any_ produced except by Goethe? And, if we admit (as I gladly do)"
5750,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"that he produced several, was not the _main_ reason simply that he was"
5751,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"born with more poetic genius than any of his contemporaries, just as"
5752,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Dante and Shakespeare and Milton were? And again, with this native"
5753,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"genius and his long laborious life, did he produce anything like as many"
5754,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"great poems as might have been expected? And, if not, why not? I do not"
5755,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"suggest that his general culture, so superior to that of his English"
5756,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"contemporaries, did not help him; but are we sure that it did not also"
5757,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"hinder him? And is it not also significant that, in spite of his love of"
5758,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"new ideas, he felt an instinctive dread of the influence of philosophy,"
5759,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"in the strict sense, as of something dangerous to the poetic modes of"
5760,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],vision and creation?
5761,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5762,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Secondly, if we look beyond the first quarter of the century to the"
5763,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"second and third, do we find in Europe a large number of those"
5764,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"emphatically great poems, solid coherent structures of concrete"
5765,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],imagination? It seems more than doubtful. To confine ourselves to
5766,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"English examples, is it not the case that Tennyson is primarily a"
5767,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"lyrical poet, that the best of his longer poems, _Maud_ and _In"
5768,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Memoriam_, are lyrical, and that the most ambitious, the narrative"
5769,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"_Idylls of the King_, is, as a whole, not great? Is the _Ring and the"
5770,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Book_, however fine in parts, a great whole, or comparable as a whole"
5771,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],with _Andrea del Sarto_ or _Rabbi ben Ezra_? And is any one of
5772,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Browning's dramas a great play? What these questions suggest is that,"
5773,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],while the difficulty about the long poem affects in an extreme degree
5774,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the age of Wordsworth, it affects in some degree the time that follows."
5775,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Its beginnings, too, are traceable before the nineteenth century. In"
5776,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],fact it is connected with essential characteristics of modern poetry and
5777,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],art; and these characteristics are connected with the nature of modern
5778,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"life, and the position of the artist within that life. I wish to touch"
5779,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],on this huge subject before returning to the age of Wordsworth.
5780,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5781,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Art, we may say, has become free, and, in a sense, universal. The poet"
5782,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"is no longer the minstrel of king or nobles, nor even of a city or"
5783,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"country. Literature, as Goethe foretold, becomes increasingly European,"
5784,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"and more than European; and the poet, however national, is a citizen of"
5785,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the Republic of Letters. No class of subject, again, has any prerogative"
5786,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"claim on him. Whatever, in any time or place, is human, whatever has"
5787,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"been conceived as divine, whatever belongs even to external nature, he"
5788,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"may choose, as it suits his bent or offers a promising material. The"
5789,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],world is all before him; and it is a world which the increase of
5790,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"knowledge has made immensely wide and rich. His art, further, has"
5791,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],asserted its independence. Its public exhibition must conform to the
5792,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],law; but otherwise it neither asks the approval nor submits to the
5793,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],control of any outward authority; and it is the handmaid of nothing. It
5794,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"claims a value for itself, as an expression of mind co-ordinate with"
5795,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"other expressions, theoretic and practical; satisfying a need and"
5796,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"serving a purpose that none of them can fulfil; subject only, as they"
5797,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"too are subject, to the unity of human nature and human good. Finally,"
5798,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],in respect of the methods of his art the poet claims and enjoys the same
5799,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"freedom. The practice of the past, the 'rules' of the past (if they"
5800,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"existed or exist), are without authority for him. It is improbable"
5801,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],beforehand that a violent breach with them will lead him to a real
5802,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"advance, just as it is improbable that such a breach with the morals or"
5803,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],the science of his day will do so. But there is no certainty beforehand;
5804,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"and if he fails, he expects blame not because he innovates, but because"
5805,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],he has failed by innovating.
5806,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5807,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"The freedom of modern art, and the universality of its field, are great"
5808,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"things, and the value of the second is easily seen in the extraordinary"
5809,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],variety of subject-matter in the longer poems of the nineteenth century.
5810,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],But in candid minds most recitals of our modern advantages are followed
5811,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],by a melancholy sense of our feebleness in using them. And so in some
5812,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],degree it is here. The unrivalled opportunities fail to produce
5813,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],unrivalled works. And we can see that the deepest cause of this is not a
5814,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],want of native genius or of acquired skill or even of conscientious
5815,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"labour, but the fact that the opportunities themselves bring danger and"
5816,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],difficulty. The poet who knows everything and may write about anything
5817,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"has, after all, a hard task. Things must have been easier, it seems to"
5818,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"us, for an artist whose choice, if his aim was high, was restricted to a"
5819,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"cycle of ideas and stories, mythological, legendary, or historical, or"
5820,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"all together, concerning beings divine, daemonic, angelic, or heroic."
5821,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"His matter, as it existed in the general imagination, was already highly"
5822,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"poetical. If not created by imagination, it was shaped or coloured by"
5823,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"it; a world not of bodiless thoughts and emotions, but of scenes,"
5824,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"figures, actions, and events. For the most part he lived in unity with"
5825,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"it; it appealed to his own religious and moral feelings and beliefs,"
5826,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"sometimes to his patriotic feelings; and he wrote, painted, or carved,"
5827,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],for people who shared with him both his material and his attitude
5828,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"towards it. It belonged usually to the past, but he did not view it over"
5829,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],a great gulf of time with the eye of a scientific historian. If he
5830,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"wished to robe it in the vesture of the life around him, he was checked"
5831,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"by no scruples as to truth; and the life around him can seldom, we"
5832,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"think, have appeared to him repulsively prosaic. Broad statements like"
5833,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"these require much qualification; but, when it is supplied, they may"
5834,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],still describe periods in which perhaps most of the greatest
5835,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"architecture, sculpture, painting, and poetry has come into being."
5836,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5837,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],How different the position of the artist has now become we see at a
5838,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"glance, and I confine myself to some points which specially concern the"
5839,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],difficulty of the long poem. If a poem is to be anything like great it
5840,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"must, in one sense, be concerned with the present. Whatever its"
5841,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"'subject' may be, it must express something living in the mind from"
5842,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"which it comes and the minds to which it goes. Wherever its body is, its"
5843,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"soul must be here and now. What subject, then, in the measureless field"
5844,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"of choice, is the poet to select and fashion into a body? The outward"
5845,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"life around him, as he and his critics so often lament, appears uniform,"
5846,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"ugly, and rationally regulated, a world of trousers, machinery and"
5847,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"policemen. Law--the rule, however imperfect, of the general reasonable"
5848,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],will--is a vast achievement and priceless possession; but it is not
5849,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],favourable to striking events or individual actions on the grand scale.
5850,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Beneath the surface, and breaking through it, there is doubtless an"
5851,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"infinity of poetic matter; but this is inward, or it fails to appear in"
5852,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"impressive forms; and therefore it may suit the lyric or idyll, the"
5853,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"monologue or short story, the prose drama or novel, but hardly the long"
5854,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"poem or high tragedy. Even war, for reasons not hard to find, is no"
5855,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],longer the subject that it was.
5856,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5857,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"But when the poet turns to a subject distant in place or time or both,"
5858,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],new troubles await him. If he aims at complete truth to time and place
5859,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],the soul of the present will hardly come into his work. Yet he lives in
5860,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"an age of history and science, and these hamper as well as help him. The"
5861,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"difficulty is not that he is bound to historical or scientific truth,"
5862,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"for in principle, I venture to say, he is free. If he _can_ satisfy"
5863,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],imagination by violating them he is justified. It is no function of his
5864,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"to attain or propagate them; and a critic who objected, say, to the"
5865,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],First Part of _Faust_ on the ground that it puts a modern spirit into
5866,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the legend, would rightly be laughed at. It is its triumph to do so and"
5867,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],yet to succeed. But then success is exceedingly difficult. For the poet
5868,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],lives in a time when the violation of truth is _prima facie_ felt to be
5869,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"a fault, something that does require justification by the result."
5870,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Further, he has himself to start from a clear consciousness of"
5871,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"difference between the present and the past, the spirit and the story,"
5872,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],and has to produce on this basis a harmony of spirit and story. And
5873,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"again, living in an age of analytical thought, he is likely--all the"
5874,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"more likely, if he has much greatness of mind--to be keenly interested"
5875,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],in ideas; and so he is exposed to the temptation of using as the spirit
5876,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],of the old story some highly reflective idea--an idea not only
5877,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"historically alien to his material, but perhaps not very poetical, or"
5878,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"again not very deep, because it belongs to him rather as philosopher"
5879,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"than poet, while his genius is that of a poet."
5880,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5881,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],The influence of some of these difficulties might readily be shown in
5882,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the Second Part of _Faust_ or in _Prometheus Unbound_, especially where"
5883,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"we perceive in a figure or action some symbolical meaning, but find this"
5884,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"meaning deficient in interest or poetic truth, or are vexed by the doubt"
5885,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],how far it ought to be pursued.[6] But the matter is more easily
5886,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],illustrated by the partial failure of the _Idylls of the King_. We have
5887,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],no right to condemn beforehand an attempt to modernise the Arthurian
5888,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"legends. Tennyson's treatment of them, even his outrage on the story of"
5889,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Tristram, might conceivably have been justified by the result. And,"
5890,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"indeed, in the _Holy Grail_ and the _Passing of Arthur_ his treatment,"
5891,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"to my mind, was more than justified. But, in spite of countless"
5892,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"beauties, the total result of the _Idylls_ was disappointing, not merely"
5893,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"from the defects of this or that poem, but because the old unity of"
5894,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"spirit and story was broken up, and the new was neither equal to the old"
5895,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"nor complete in itself. For the main semi-allegorical idea, having"
5896,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"already the disadvantage of not being poetic in its origin, was, as a"
5897,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"reflective idea, by no means profound, and it led to such inconsistency"
5898,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],in the very centre of the story as the imagination refuses to accept.
5899,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Tennyson's Lancelot might have wronged the Arthur who is merely a
5900,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],blameless king and represents Conscience; but Tennyson's Lancelot would
5901,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],much rather have killed himself than be systematically treacherous to
5902,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],the friend and lover-husband who appears in _Guinevere_.[7]
5903,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5904,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],These difficulties belong in some measure to the whole modern time--the
5905,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],whole time that begins with the Renaissance; but they become so much
5906,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],clearer and so much more serious with the advance of knowledge and
5907,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"criticism, that in speaking of them I have been referring specially to"
5908,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],the last century. There are other difficulties not so closely connected
5909,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"with that advance, and I will venture some very tentative remarks on"
5910,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"one of these, which also has increased with time. It has to do with the"
5911,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],kind of life commonly lived by our poets. Is there not some significance
5912,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"in the fact that the most famous of our narrative poets were all three,"
5913,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"in their various ways and degrees, public men, or in contact with great"
5914,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],affairs; and that poets in earlier times no less must usually have seen
5915,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"something at first hand of adventure, political struggles, or war;"
5916,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"whereas poets now, for the most part, live wholly private lives, and,"
5917,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"like the majority of their readers, are acquainted only by report with"
5918,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"anything of the kind? If Chaucer had never been at Court, or seen"
5919,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"service in the French war, or gone on embassies abroad; if Spenser had"
5920,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],not known Sidney and Raleigh and been secretary to Lord Grey in Ireland;
5921,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],if Milton had spent his whole life at Horton; would it have made no
5922,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"difference to their poetry? Again, if we turn to the drama and ask why"
5923,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],the numerous tragedies of the nineteenth century poets so rarely
5924,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"satisfy, what is the answer? There are many reasons, and among them the"
5925,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],poet's ignorance of the stage will doubtless count for much; but must we
5926,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],not also consider that he scarcely ever saw anything resembling the
5927,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],things he tried to portray? When we study the history of the time in
5928,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"which the Elizabethan dramas were composed, when we examine the"
5929,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"portraits of the famous men, or read such a book as the autobiography of"
5930,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Lord Herbert of Cherbury, we realise that the violent actions and"
5931,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],passions which the dramatist depicted were like the things he saw.
5932,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Whatever Shakespeare's own disposition was, he lived among these men,"
5933,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],jested with the fellow-actor who had borne arms abroad and killed his
5934,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"man in a duel at home, conversed with nobles whose heads perhaps were no"
5935,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],great way from the block. But the poet who strolls about the lanes or
5936,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"plods the London streets with an umbrella for a sword, and who has"
5937,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"probably never seen a violent deed in his life, or for a moment really"
5938,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"longed to kill so much as a critic, how is he to paint the vengeance of"
5939,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Hamlet or the frenzy of Macbeth, and not merely to thrill you with the"
5940,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],emotions of his actors but to make them _do_ things that take your
5941,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],imagination by the throat?
5942,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5943,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5944,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],3.
5945,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5946,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Assuming, now, that (even if this last idea is doubtful or unimportant)"
5947,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],there is some truth in the suggestion that the difficulties of the long
5948,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"poem arise largely from the conditions described, and especially from"
5949,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],the nature of the intellectual atmosphere which the modern poet
5950,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"breathes, let us return to Wordsworth's age in particular. In that age"
5951,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],these difficulties were aggravated in a quite exceptional way by special
5952,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"causes, causes responsible also in part for the unusual originality and"
5953,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],intensity of the poetry. In it we find conditions removed to the
5954,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"extremest distance from those of the poet who wrote, in the midst of a"
5955,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"generally accepted social order, for an audience with which he shared"
5956,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],traditional ideas and beliefs and a more or less traditional imaginative
5957,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"material. It was, in a word, a revolutionary age, in the electric"
5958,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],atmosphere of which the most potent intellectual influences were those
5959,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],of Rousseau and (for the English poets) of Godwin. Milton's time was not
5960,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"in the same sense revolutionary, much less Shakespeare's. The forces of"
5961,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],the great movement of mind in Shakespeare's day _we_ may formulate as
5962,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"'ideas,' but they were not the abstractly conceived ideas of"
5963,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth's day. Such theoretical ideas were potent in Milton's time,"
5964,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"but they were not ideas that made a total breach with the past,"
5965,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"rejecting as worthless, or worse, the institutions, beliefs, and modes"
5966,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"of life in which human nature had endeavoured to realise itself, and"
5967,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],drawing airy pictures of a different human nature on a new earth. Nor
5968,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],was the poetic mind of those ages enraptured or dejected by the haunting
5969,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],many-featured contrast of real and ideal. But the poetic mind in
5970,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Wordsworth's age breathed this atmosphere of revolution, though it was"
5971,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],not always sensitive to the influence. Nor is it a question of the
5972,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],acceptance or rejection of the 'ideas of the Revolution.' That influence
5973,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],is clearly traceable in all the greater writers except Scott and Jane
5974,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Austen. It is equally obvious in Wordsworth, who hungered for realities,"
5975,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"recovered from his theoretic malady, sought for good in life's familiar"
5976,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"face, yet remained a preacher; in Byron, who was too shrewd, sceptical,"
5977,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"and selfish to contract that particular malady, but who suffered from"
5978,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the sickness from which Goethe freed himself by writing _Werther_,[8]"
5979,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],and who punctuates his story in _Don Juan_ with bursts of laughter and
5980,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"tears; and in Shelley, whose 'rapid spirit' was quickened, and then"
5981,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"clogged, by the abstractions of revolutionary theory."
5982,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
5983,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"But doubtless Shelley is, in a sense, the typical example of this"
5984,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],influence and of its effects. From the world of his imagination the
5985,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"shapes of the old world had disappeared, and their place was taken by a"
5986,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"stream of radiant vapours, incessantly forming, shifting, and dissolving"
5987,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"in the 'clear golden dawn,' and hymning with the voices of seraphs, to"
5988,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the music of the stars and the 'singing rain,' the sublime ridiculous"
5989,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],formulas of Godwin. In his heart were emotions that responded to the
5990,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"vision,--an aspiration or ecstasy, a dejection or despair, like those of"
5991,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"spirits rapt into Paradise or mourning over its ruin. And he wrote, not,"
5992,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"like Shakespeare or Pope, for Londoners sitting in a theatre or a"
5993,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"coffee-house, intelligences vivid enough but definitely embodied in a"
5994,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"definite society; he wrote, or rather he sang, to his own soul, to"
5995,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],other spirit-sparks of the fire of Liberty scattered over the dark
5996,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"earth, to spirits in the air, to the boundless spirit of Nature or"
5997,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Freedom or Love, his one place of rest and the one source of his vision,"
5998,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"ecstasy, and sorrow. He sang _to_ this, and he sang _of_ it, and of the"
5999,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"emotions it inspired, and of its world-wide contest with such shapes of"
6000,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],darkness as Faith and Custom. And he made immortal music; now in
6001,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"melodies as exquisite and varied as the songs of Schubert, and now in"
6002,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],symphonies where the crudest of Philosophies of History melted into
6003,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],golden harmony. But the songs were more perfect than the symphonies; and
6004,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"they could hardly fail to be so. For a single thought and mood,"
6005,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"expressive of one aspect of things, suffices, with its melody, for a"
6006,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"lyric, but not for a long poem. That requires a substance which"
6007,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],implicitly contains a whole 'criticism' or interpretation of life. And
6008,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"although there was something always working in Shelley's mind, and"
6009,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"issuing in those radiant vapours, that was far deeper and truer than his"
6010,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"philosophic creed, its expression and even its development were"
6011,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],constantly checked or distorted by the hard and narrow framework of that
6012,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],creed. And it was one which in effect condemned nine-tenths of the human
6013,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],nature that has formed the material of the world's great poems.[9]
6014,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
6015,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],The second and third quarters of the century were not in the same degree
6016,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"as the first a revolutionary time, and we feel this change in the"
6017,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"poetry. The fever-heat is gone, the rapture and the dejection moderate,"
6018,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the culture is wider, the thought more staid and considerate, the"
6019,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"fascination of abstractions less potent, and the formative or plastic"
6020,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"impulse, if not stronger, less impeded. Late in the period, with Morris,"
6021,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the born teller of tales re-appears. If, as we saw, the lyrical spirit"
6022,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"continues to prevail, no one would deny to Browning the full and robust"
6023,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],sympathy of the dramatist with all the variety of character and passion.
6024,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Yet these changes and others are far from obliterating those features of
6025,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],the earlier generation on which we have dwelt. To describe the
6026,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],atmosphere of 'criticism' as that of a common faith or view of the world
6027,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"would be laughable. If not revolutionary, it was agitated, restless, and"
6028,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],distressed by the conflict of theoretic ideas. To Arnold's mind it was
6029,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"indeed a most unhappy time for poetry, though the poetic impulse"
6030,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"remained as yet, and even later, powerful. The past was dead, but he"
6031,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],could share neither the soaring hope nor the passionate melancholy of
6032,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],the opening century. He was
6033,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
6034,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Wandering between two worlds, one dead,"
6035,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"The other powerless to be born,"
6036,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],With nowhere yet to rest his head.
6037,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
6038,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"And the two greatest poets, as well as he, still offer not only, as"
6039,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"poets always must, an interpretation, but a definite theory of life,"
6040,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"and, more insistently than ever before, of death. Confidence in the"
6041,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"detail, at least, of such theories has diminished, and with the rapid"
6042,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],advance of the critical sciences the poets may prophesy less than their
6043,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"predecessors; but they probe, and weigh, and deliberate more. And the"
6044,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"strength of the 'inward' tendency, obvious in Tennyson and Arnold, may"
6045,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"be clearly seen even in Browning, and not alone in such works as"
6046,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],_Christmas Eve and Easter Day_ or _La Saisiaz_.
6047,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
6048,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Objective and dramatic as Browning is called and by comparison is, he is"
6049,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"surely most at home, and succeeds most completely, in lyrics, and in"
6050,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],monologues divested of action and merely suggestive of a story or
6051,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"suggested by one. He too must begin, in _Pauline_, with the picture of a"
6052,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],youthful poet's soul. Dramatic the drama of _Paracelsus_ neither is nor
6053,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],tries to be: it consists of scenes in the history of souls. Of the
6054,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],narrative _Sordello_ its author wrote: 'The historical decoration was
6055,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],purposely of no more importance than a background requires; and my
6056,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],stress lay on the incidents in the development of a soul: little else is
6057,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"worth study.' Even if that is so, great narrative poems are not written"
6058,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],thus. And what Browning says here applies more or less fully to most of
6059,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"his works. In the end, if we set aside the short lyrics, his best poems"
6060,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"are all 'studies' of souls. 'Well,' it may be answered, 'so are"
6061,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Shakespeare's tragedies and tragi-comedies.' But the difference is
6062,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"great. Shakespeare, doubtless, is little concerned with the accuracy of"
6063,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the historical background,--much less concerned than Browning. But his"
6064,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"subject is not a soul, nor even souls: it is the actions of souls, or"
6065,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],souls coming into action. It is more. It is that clash of souls which
6066,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"exhibits not them alone, but a whole of spiritual forces, appearing in"
6067,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"them, but spreading beyond them into the visible society to which they"
6068,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"essentially belong, and into invisible regions which enclose it. The"
6069,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"thing shown, therefore, is huge, multiform, ponderous, yet quivering"
6070,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],with an inward agitation which explodes into violent bodily expression
6071,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],and speaks to the _eye_ of imagination. What specially interests
6072,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Browning is not this. It is the soul moving in itself, often in its most"
6073,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"secret windings and recesses; before action or after it, where there is"
6074,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],action at all; and this soul not essentially as in its society (that is
6075,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"'background' or 'decoration'), but alone, or in relation to another"
6076,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"soul, or to God. He exhibits it best, therefore, in monologue, musing,"
6077,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"explaining, debating, pleading, overflowing into the expression of"
6078,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"feeling or passion, but not acting. The 'men and women' that haunt the"
6079,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"reader's imagination are not so much men of action as lovers, artists,"
6080,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],men of religion. And when they act (as for example in _The Ring and the
6081,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Book_, or the dramas) what rivets attention, and is first recalled to"
6082,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"memory by their names, is not the action, but its reflection in the soul"
6083,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"of the doer or spectator. Such, at least, is my experience; and in the"
6084,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],end a critic can only offer to others his considered experience. But
6085,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],with Homer and Shakespeare and Milton it is otherwise. Even with Dante
6086,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"it is otherwise. I see not souls alone, but souls in visible attitudes,"
6087,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"in outward movement, often in action. I see Paolo and Francesca drifting"
6088,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],on the wind: I see them sitting and reading: I see them kiss: I _see_
6089,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Dante's pity:
6090,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
6091,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],E caddi come corpo morto cade.
6092,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
6093,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
6094,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],4.
6095,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
6096,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"I spoke of Tennyson and Browning in order to point out that, although in"
6097,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"their day the intellectual atmosphere was no longer 'revolutionary,' it"
6098,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],remained an atmosphere of highly reflective ideas representing no common
6099,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"'faith' or way of envisaging the world, and that the inward tendency"
6100,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],still asserts itself in their poetry. We cannot pursue the history
6101,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"further, but it does not appear that in the last forty years culture has"
6102,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"advanced much, or at all, towards such a faith or way, or shows the"
6103,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],working of new semi-conscious creative ideas beneath the surface of
6104,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],warring theories and opinions. Only the younger among us can hope to see
6105,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"what Arnold descried in the distance,"
6106,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
6107,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],One mighty wave of thought and joy
6108,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Lifting mankind again.
6109,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
6110,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"And even when, for them or their descendants, that hope is realised, and"
6111,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"with it the hope of a new great poetry, the atmosphere must assuredly"
6112,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"still be one of 'criticism,' and Arnold's insistence on the necessity of"
6113,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],the best criticism will still be as urgently required. It must indeed be
6114,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],more and more needed as the power of half-educated journalism grows. How
6115,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"poetry then will overcome the obstacles which, therefore, must in some"
6116,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"measure still beset it, is a question for it, a question answerable not"
6117,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"by the reflections of critics, but by the creative deeds of poets"
6118,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"themselves. Accordingly, while one may safely prophesy that their long"
6119,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"poems will differ from those of any past age, I have no idea of"
6120,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"predicting the nature of this difference, and will refer in conclusion"
6121,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],only to certain views which seem to me delusive.
6122,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
6123,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],It must surely be vain for the poet to seek an escape from modern
6124,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],difficulties by any attempt to withdraw himself from the atmosphere of
6125,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"free and scientific culture, to maintain by force simplicity of view and"
6126,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"concreteness of imagination, to live in a past century or a sanctuary of"
6127,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"esoteric art, whether secular or religious. Whatever of value such an"
6128,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],attempt may yield--and that it may yield much I do not deny--it will
6129,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],never yield poems at once long and great.
6130,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
6131,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Such poems, we may allow ourselves to hope, will sometimes deal with"
6132,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"much of the common and painful and ugly stuff of life, and be in that"
6133,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],sense more 'democratic' or universal than any poetry of the past. But it
6134,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],is vain to imagine that this can be done by a refusal to 'interpret' and
6135,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],an endeavour to photograph. Even in the most thorough-going prose
6136,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"'realism' there is selection; and, to go no further, selection itself is"
6137,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"interpretation. And, as for poetry, the mirror which the least"
6138,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"theoretical of great poets holds up to nature is his soul. And that,"
6139,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"whether he likes it or not, is an activity which divides, and sifts,"
6140,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"and recombines into a unity of its own, and by a method of its own, the"
6141,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],crude material which experience thrusts upon it. This must be so; the
6142,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],only question is of the choice of matter and the method of treatment.
6143,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"Nor can the end to be achieved be anything but beauty, though the"
6144,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],meaning of that word may be extended and deepened. And beauty in its
6145,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"essence is something that gives satisfaction, however much of pain,"
6146,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"repulsion, or horror that satisfaction may contain and overcome."
6147,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
6148,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"'But, even so,' it may be said, 'why should the poet trouble himself"
6149,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"about figures, events, and actions? That inward tendency in which you"
6150,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"see danger and difficulty is, on the contrary, simply and solely what on"
6151,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"one side you admit it to be, the sign of our advance. What we really"
6152,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],need is to make our long poems _entirely_ interior. We only want to know
6153,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],how Dante felt; we do not _wish_ to see his pity felling him to the
6154,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"ground; and much less do we wish to hear Othello say ""and smote him"
6155,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"thus,"" or even to imagine the blow. We are not children or savages.' We"
6156,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"do not want, I agree, attempts to repeat the Elizabethan drama. But"
6157,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"those who speak thus forget, perhaps, in how many kinds of poem this"
6158,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],inward tendency can display its power without any injury or drawback.
6159,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"They fail to ask themselves, perhaps, whether a _long_ poem so entirely"
6160,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"'interior' can possibly have the clearness, variety, and solidity of"
6161,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],effect that the best long poems have possessed; whether it can produce
6162,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the same impression of a massive, building, organising, 'architectonic'"
6163,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],power of imagination; and whether all this and much else is of little
6164,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"value. They can hardly have realised, one must suspect, how much of life"
6165,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"they wish to leave unrepresented. They fail to consider, too, that"
6166,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"perhaps the business of art is not to ignore, but at once to satisfy and"
6167,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"to purify, the primitive instincts from which it arises; and that, in"
6168,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the case of poetic art, the love of a story, and of exceptional figures,"
6169,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"scenes, events, and actions, is one of those instincts, and one that in"
6170,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"the immense majority of men shows no sign of decay. And finally, if they"
6171,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"suppose that the desire to see or imagine action, in particular, is a"
6172,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"symptom of mere sensationalism or a relic of semi-barbarism, I am sure"
6173,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],they are woefully mistaken. There is more virtue than their philosophy
6174,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"dreams of in deeds, in 'the motion of a muscle this way or that.'"
6175,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],Doubtless it is the soul that matters; but the soul that remains
6176,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],interior is not the whole soul. If I suppose that mere self-scrutiny can
6177,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"show me that, I deceive myself; and my deeds, good and evil, will"
6178,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],undeceive me.
6179,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],
6180,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"A last delusion remains. 'There is,' we may be told, 'a simple, final,"
6181,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],and comfortable answer to all these doubts and fears. The long poem is
6182,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"not merely difficult, it is impossible. It is dead, and should be"
6183,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"publicly buried, and there is not the least occasion to mourn it. It has"
6184,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"become impossible not because we cannot write it, but because we see"
6185,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"that we ought not. And, in truth, it never was written. The thing called"
6186,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"a long poem was really, as any long poem must be, a number of short"
6187,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"ones, linked together by passages of prose. And these passages _could_"
6188,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],be nothing except prose; for poetry is the language of a state of
6189,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"crisis, and a crisis is brief. The long poem is an offence to art.' I"
6190,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"believe I have stated this theory fairly. It was, unless I mistake, the"
6191,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"invention of Poe, and it is about as true as I conceive his story of the"
6192,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],composition of _The Raven_ to be. It became a gospel with some
6193,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],representatives of the Symbolist movement in France; and in fact it
6194,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"would condemn not only the long poem, but the middle-sized one, and"
6195,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],indeed all sizes but the smallest. To reject this theory is to imply no
6196,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],want of gratitude for the lyrics of some of its adherents; but the
6197,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"theory itself seems strangely thoughtless. Naturally, in any poem not"
6198,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"quite short, there must be many variations and grades of poetic"
6199,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],intensity; but to represent the differences of these numerous grades as
6200,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],a simple antithesis between pure poetry and mere prose is like saying
6201,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"that, because the eyes are the most expressive part of the face, the"
6202,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"rest of the face expresses nothing. To hold, again, that this variation"
6203,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],of intensity is a defect is like holding that a face would be more
6204,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"beautiful if it were all eyes, a picture better if the illumination were"
6205,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"equally intense all over it, a symphony better if it consisted of one"
6206,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"movement, and if that were all crisis. And to speak as if a small poem"
6207,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"could do all that a long one does, and do it much more completely, is to"
6208,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],speak as though a humming-bird could have the same kind of beauty as an
6209,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"eagle, the rainbow in a fountain produce the same effect as the rainbow"
6210,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"in the sky, or a moorland stream thunder like Niagara. A long poem, as"
6211,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"we have seen, requires imaginative powers superfluous in a short one;"
6212,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],and it would be easy to show that it admits of strictly poetic effects
6213,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],of the highest value which the mere brevity of a short one excludes.
6214,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"That the long poem is doomed is a possible, however groundless, belief;"
6215,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],"but it is futile to deny that, if it dies, something of inestimable"
6216,THE LONG POEM IN THE AGE OF WORDSWORTH[1],worth will perish.[10]

6252,FOOTNOTES:,which many lovers of Tennyson read parts of Arthur's speech in that
6253,FOOTNOTES:,"Idyll; but it is the main cause, and, unlike other defects, it lies"
6254,FOOTNOTES:,in the plan of the story. It may be brought out further thus. So far
6255,FOOTNOTES:,as Arthur is merely the blameless king and representative of
6256,FOOTNOTES:,"Conscience, the attitude of a judge which he assumes in the speech is"
6257,FOOTNOTES:,"appropriate, and, again, Lancelot's treachery to him is intelligible"

6259,FOOTNOTES:,"could never be a satisfactory husband, and ought not to astound or"

6269,FOOTNOTES:,"Having written this criticism, I cannot refrain from adding that I"

6282,FOOTNOTES:,to observe that Godwin's formulas are called sublime as well as
6283,FOOTNOTES:,ridiculous. _Political Justice_ would never have fascinated such
6284,FOOTNOTES:,"young men as Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley, unless a great truth"

6288,FOOTNOTES:,
6289,FOOTNOTES:,"[10] The theory criticised in this paragraph arises, I think, from a"
6290,FOOTNOTES:,misapplication of the truth that the content of a genuine poem is
6291,FOOTNOTES:,fully expressible only in the words of that poem. It is seen that
6292,FOOTNOTES:,"this is so in a lyric, and then it is assumed that it is _not_ so in"
6293,FOOTNOTES:,a narrative or drama. But the assumption is false. At first sight we
6294,FOOTNOTES:,may seem able to give a more adequate account of the long poem than
6295,FOOTNOTES:,of the short one; but in reality you can no more convey the whole
6296,FOOTNOTES:,poetic content of the _Divine Comedy_ in a form not its own than you
6297,FOOTNOTES:,can the content of a song.
6298,FOOTNOTES:,
6299,FOOTNOTES:,The theory is connected in some minds with the view that 'music is
6300,FOOTNOTES:,the true type or measure of perfected art.' That view again rests on
6301,FOOTNOTES:,the idea that 'it is the art of music which most completely realises
6302,FOOTNOTES:,"[the] artistic ideal, [the] perfect identification of form and"

6308,FOOTNOTES:,follows is that poetry should endeavour _in its own way_ to achieve
6309,FOOTNOTES:,that perfect identification; but it does not in the least follow that
6310,FOOTNOTES:,it should endeavour to do so by reducing itself as nearly as possible

6321,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6322,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6323,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,There is no lack of good criticism on the poetry of Keats. It has been
6324,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,discussed by the leading poets of three generations or semi-generations;
6325,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"by Matthew Arnold, by Mr. Swinburne, and, much more fully, by Mr."
6326,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Bridges. Lord Houghton's _Life and Letters_ and Mr. Colvin's biography
6327,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,both contain excellent criticisms or studies of the poems. And (to go no
6328,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,further) they have lately been edited by Mr. de Sélincourt in a volume
6329,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"invaluable to students of Keats, and reflecting honour not only on its"
6330,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"author but on the Oxford School of English, to the strength of which he"
6331,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,has contributed so much. My principal object is to consider Keats's
6332,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"attitude to poetry and his views about it, in connection with the ideas"
6333,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,set forth in previous lectures on Shelley's views and on the age of
6334,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Wordsworth. But I wish to preface my remarks on this subject, and to"
6335,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"prepare for them, by an urgent appeal, addressed to any reader of the"
6336,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"poems who may need it, to study the letters of Keats. If I may judge"
6337,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"from my experience, such readers are still far too numerous; and I am"
6338,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,sure that no one already familiar with the letters will be sorry to
6339,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,listen to quotations from them.[1]
6340,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6341,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6342,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"The best of Keats's poems, of course, can be fully appreciated without"
6343,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"extraneous help; but the letters throw light on all, and they are almost"
6344,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,necessary to the understanding of _Endymion_ and of some of the earlier
6345,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,or contemporaneous pieces. They clearly reveal those changes in his mind
6346,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,and temper which appear in his poetry. They dispose for ever of the
6347,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,fictions once current of a puny Keats who was 'snuffed out by an
6348,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"article,' a sensual Keats who found his ideal in claret and 'slippery"
6349,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"blisses,' and a mere artist Keats who cared nothing for his country and"
6350,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,his fellow-creatures. Written in his last four years by a man who died
6351,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"at twenty-five, they contain abundant evidence of his immaturity and his"
6352,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"faults, but they disclose a nature and character which command on the"
6353,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"whole not less respect than affection, and they show not a little of"
6354,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,that general intellectual power which rarely fails to accompany poetic
6355,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,genius.
6356,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6357,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Of Keats's character, as the letters manifest it, Arnold has written."
6358,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,While speaking plainly and decidedly of the weakness visible in those to
6359,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Miss Brawne, Arnold brought together the evidence which proves that"
6360,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Keats 'had flint and iron in him,' 'had virtue in the true and large"
6361,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"sense of the word.' And he selected passages, too, which illustrate the"
6362,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,'admirable wisdom and temper' and the 'strength and clearness of
6363,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"judgment' shown by Keats, alike in matters of friendship and in his"
6364,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"criticisms of his own productions, of the public, and of the literary"
6365,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"circles,--the 'jabberers about pictures and books,' as Keats in a bitter"
6366,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"mood once called them. We may notice, in addition, two characteristics."
6367,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"In spite of occasional despondency, and of feelings of awe at the"
6368,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"magnitude of his ambition, Keats, it is tolerably plain from these"
6369,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"letters, had a clear and habitual consciousness of his genius. He never"
6370,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,dreamed of being a minor poet. He knew that he was a poet; sometimes he
6371,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,hoped to be a great one. I remember no sign that he felt himself the
6372,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"inferior of any living poet except Wordsworth. How he thought of Byron,"
6373,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"whom in boyhood he had admired, is obvious. When Shelley wrote, hinting"
6374,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"a criticism, but referring to himself as excelled by Keats in genius, he"
6375,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,returned the criticism without the compliment. His few references to
6376,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Coleridge are critical, and his amusing description of Coleridge's talk"
6377,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"is not more reverential than Carlyle's. Something, indeed, of the native"
6378,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,pugnacity which his friends ascribe to him seems to show itself in his
6379,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"allusions to contemporaries, including even Wordsworth. Yet with all"
6380,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"this, and with all his pride and his desire of fame, no letters extant"
6381,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,breathe a more simple and natural modesty than these; and from end to
6382,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"end they exhibit hardly a trace, if any trace, either of the irritable"
6383,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,vanity attributed to poets or of the sublime egotism of Milton and
6384,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Wordsworth. He was of Shakespeare's tribe.
6385,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6386,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,The other trait that I wish to refer to appears in a particular series
6387,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,of letters--sometimes mere notes--scattered through the collection. They
6388,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"are addressed to Keats's school-girl sister Fanny, who was eight years"
6389,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"younger than he, and who died in the same year as Browning.[2] Keats, as"
6390,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"we see him in 1817 and 1818, in the first half of Mr. Colvin's"
6391,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"collection, was absorbed by an enthusiasm and ambition which his sister"
6392,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"was too young to understand. During his last two years he was, besides,"
6393,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"passionately and miserably in love, and, latterly, ill and threatened"
6394,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"with death. His soul was full of bitterness. He shrank into himself,"
6395,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"avoided society, and rarely sought even intimate friends. Yet, until he"
6396,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"left England, he never ceased to visit his sister when he could; and,"
6397,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"when he could not, he continued to write letters to her, full of amusing"
6398,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"nonsense, full of brotherly care for her, and of excellent advice"
6399,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,offered as by an equal who happened to be her senior; letters quite free
6400,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"from thoughts of himself, and from the forced gaiety and the resentment"
6401,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,against fate which in parts of his later correspondence with others
6402,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"betray his suffering. These letters to his sister are, in one sense, the"
6403,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"least remarkable in the collection, yet it would lose much by their"
6404,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"omission. They tell us next to nothing of his genius, but as we come"
6405,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"upon them the light in our picture of him, if it had grown for a moment"
6406,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"hard or troubled, becomes once more soft and bright."
6407,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6408,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,To turn (with apologies for the distinction) from the character to the
6409,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"mind of Keats, if the reader has formed a notion of him as a youth with"
6410,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"a genius for poetry and an exclusive interest in poetry, but otherwise"
6411,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"not intellectually remarkable, this error will soon be dispelled by the"
6412,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"letters. With Keats, no doubt, poetry and the hope of success in it were"
6413,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,passions more glowing than we have reason to attribute to his
6414,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,contemporaries at the same time of life.[3] The letters remind us also
6415,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"that, compared with them, he was at a disadvantage in intellectual"
6416,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"training and acquisitions, like the young Shakespeare among the"
6417,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"University wits. They show, too--the earlier far more than the later--in"
6418,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,certain literary mannerisms the unwholesome influence of Leigh Hunt and
6419,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,his circle. But everywhere we feel in them the presence of an
6420,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"intellectual nature, not merely sensitive and delicate, but open,"
6421,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"daring, rich, and strong; exceedingly poetic and romantic, yet"
6422,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"observant, acute, humorous, and sensible; intense without narrowness,"
6423,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,and quite as various both in its interests and its capacities as the
6424,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"mind of Wordsworth or of Shelley. Fundamentally, and in spite of"
6425,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"abundant high spirits and a love of nonsense, the mind of Keats was very"
6426,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"serious and thoughtful. It was original, and not more imitative than an"
6427,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,original mind should be in youth; an intelligence which now startles by
6428,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"flashes of sudden beauty, and now is seen struggling with new and deep"
6429,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"thoughts, which labour into shape, with scanty aid from theories, out of"
6430,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,personal experience. In quality--and I speak of nothing else--the mind
6431,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,of Shakespeare at three and twenty may not have been very different.
6432,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6433,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Short extracts can give but little idea of all this; but they may at
6434,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"least illustrate the variety of Keats's mind, and the passages I am"
6435,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"about to read have been chosen mainly with this intention, and not"
6436,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,because the majority are among the most striking that might be found.
6437,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"The earliest belong to the September of 1817, and I take them partly for"
6438,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"their local interest. Keats spent most of that month here in Oxford,"
6439,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"staying in the Magdalen Hall of those days with his friend Bailey, a man"
6440,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"whose gentle and disinterested character he warmly admired. 'We lead,'"
6441,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"he writes to his sister, 'very industrious lives--he in general studies,"
6442,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,and I in proceeding at a pretty good pace with a Poem which I hope you
6443,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"will see early in the next year.' It was _Endymion_: he wrote, it seems,"
6444,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,the whole of the Third Book in Bailey's rooms. Unluckily the hero in
6445,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,that Book is wandering at the bottom of the sea; but even in those
6446,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"regions, as Keats imagined them, a diligent student may perhaps find"
6447,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"some traces of Oxford. In the letters we hear of towers and quadrangles,"
6448,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,cloisters and groves; of the deer in Magdalen Park; and how
6449,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6450,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"The mouldering arch,"
6451,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Shaded o'er by a larch,"
6452,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Lives next door to Wilson the hosier
6453,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6454,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,(that should be discoverable). But we hear most of the clear
6455,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,streams--'more clear streams than ever I saw together.' 'I take a walk
6456,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,by the side of one of them every evening.' 'For these last five or six
6457,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"days,' he writes to Reynolds, 'we have had regularly a boat on the Isis,"
6458,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and explored all the streams about, which are more in number than your"
6459,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"eyelashes. We sometimes skim into a bed of rushes, and there become"
6460,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"naturalised river-folks. There is one particularly nice nest, which we"
6461,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"have christened ""Reynolds's Cove,"" in which we have read Wordsworth and"
6462,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,talked as may be.' Of those talks over Wordsworth with the grave
6463,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,religious Bailey came perhaps the thoughts expressed later in the
6464,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"best-known of all the letters (it is too well known to quote), thoughts"
6465,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,which take their origin from the _Lines written near Tintern Abbey_.[4]
6466,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6467,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"About a year after this, Keats went with his friend Brown on a"
6468,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,walking-tour to the Highlands; and I will quote two passages from the
6469,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"letters written during this tour, for the sake of the contrast they"
6470,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,exhibit between the two strains in Keats's mind. The first is the later.
6471,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,The letter is dated 'Cairn-something July 17th':
6472,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6473,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Steam-boats on Loch Lomond, and Barouches on its sides, take a little"
6474,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,from the pleasure of such romantic chaps as Brown and I. The banks of
6475,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,the Clyde are extremely beautiful--the north end of Loch Lomond grand
6476,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,in excess--the entrance at the lower end to the narrow part is
6477,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,precious good--the evening was beautiful--nothing could surpass our
6478,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,fortune in the weather. Yet was I worldly enough to wish for a fleet
6479,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"of chivalry Barges with trumpets and banners, just to die away before"
6480,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,me into that blue place among the mountains.[5]
6481,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6482,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Keats all over! Yes; but so is this, which was written a fortnight"
6483,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,earlier from Carlisle:
6484,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6485,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"After Skiddaw, we walked to Ireby, the oldest market town in"
6486,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Cumberland, where we were greatly amused by a country dancing-school"
6487,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,holden at the Tun. It was indeed 'no new cotillion fresh from
6488,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"France.' No, they kickit and jumpit with mettle extraordinary, and"
6489,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"whiskit, and friskit, and toed it and go'd it, and twirl'd it and"
6490,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"whirl'd it, and stamped it, and sweated it, tattooing the floor like"
6491,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,mad. The difference between our country dances and these Scottish
6492,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,figures is about the same as leisurely stirring a cup o' tea and
6493,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"beating up a batter-pudding. I was extremely gratified to think that,"
6494,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"if I had pleasures they knew nothing of, they had also some into which"
6495,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,I could not possibly enter. I hope I shall not return without having
6496,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,got the Highland fling. There was as fine a row of boys and girls as
6497,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"you ever saw; some beautiful faces, and one exquisite mouth. I never"
6498,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"felt so near the glory of Patriotism, the glory of making by any means"
6499,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,a country happier. This is what I like better than scenery.[6]
6500,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6501,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,There is little enough here of the young poet who believes himself to
6502,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,care for nothing but 'Art'; and as little of the theoretic
6503,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,cosmopolitanism of some of Keats's friends.
6504,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6505,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Some three months later we find Keats writing from London to his brother
6506,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,and his sister-in-law in America; and he tells them of a young lady from
6507,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,India whom he has just met:
6508,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6509,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"She is not a Cleopatra, but she is at least a Charmian. She has a rich"
6510,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Eastern look. When she comes into a room she makes an impression the
6511,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,same as the beauty of a leopardess.... You will by this time think I
6512,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,am in love with her; so before I go any further I will tell you I am
6513,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,not--she kept me awake one night as a tune of Mozart's might do. I
6514,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"speak of the thing as a pastime and an amusement, than which I can"
6515,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"feel none deeper than a conversation with an imperial woman, the very"
6516,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"'yes' and 'no' of whose lips is to me a banquet.... I believe, though,"
6517,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,she has faults--the same as Charmian and Cleopatra might have had. Yet
6518,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"she is a fine thing, speaking in a worldly way: for there are two"
6519,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"distinct tempers of mind in which we judge of things,--the worldly,"
6520,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"theatrical and pantomimical; and the unearthly, spiritual and"
6521,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"ethereal. In the former, Buonaparte, Lord Byron, and this Charmian,"
6522,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"hold the first place in our minds; in the latter, John Howard, Bishop"
6523,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Hooker rocking his child's cradle, and you, my dear sister, are the"
6524,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,conquering feelings.[7]
6525,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6526,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"I do not read this passage merely for its biographical interest, but a"
6527,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,word may be ventured on that. The lady was not Miss Brawne; but less
6528,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"than a month later, on meeting Miss Brawne, he immediately became her"
6529,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"slave. When we observe the fact, and consider how very unlike the words"
6530,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"I have quoted are to anything in Keats's previous letters, we can hardly"
6531,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,help suspecting that he was at this time in a peculiar condition and
6532,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,ripe for his fate. Then we remember that he had lately returned from his
6533,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Scotch tour, which was broken off because the Inverness doctor used the"
6534,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"most menacing language about the state of his throat; and further, that"
6535,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"he was now, in the late autumn, nursing his brother Tom, who died of"
6536,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"consumption before the year was out. And an idea suggests itself which,"
6537,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"if exceedingly prosaic, has yet some comfort in it. How often have"
6538,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"readers of Keats's life cried out that, if only he had never met Miss"
6539,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Brawne, he might have lived and prospered! Does it not seem at least as"
6540,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"probable that, if Miss Brawne had never existed, what happened would"
6541,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"still have happened, and even that the fever of passion which helped to"
6542,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,destroy him was itself a token of incipient disease?
6543,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6544,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"I turn the leaf and come, in the same letter, to a passage on politics."
6545,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"The friends of Keats were, for the most part, advanced liberals. His own"
6546,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,sympathies went that way. A number of lines in the poems of his boyhood
6547,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"show this, and so do many remarks in the letters. And his sympathies"
6548,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"were not mere sentiments. 'I hope sincerely,' he wrote in September,"
6549,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"1819, 'I shall be able to put a mite of help to the liberal side of the"
6550,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"question before I die'; and a few days later, when he tells Brown of his"
6551,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"wish to act instead of dreaming, and to work for his livelihood,"
6552,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"composing deliberate poems only when he can afford to, he says that he"
6553,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"will write as a journalist for whoever will pay him, but he makes it a"
6554,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,condition that he is to write 'on the liberal side of the question.' It
6555,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,is a mistake to suppose that he had no political interests. But he
6556,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,cared nothing for the mere quarrels of Whig and Tory; a 'Radical' was
6557,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,for him the type of an 'obstinate and heady' man; and the perfectibility
6558,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,theories of friends like Shelley and Dilke slipped from his mind like
6559,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,water from a duck's back. We have seen the concrete shape his patriotism
6560,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"took. He always saw ideas embodied, and was 'convinced that small causes"
6561,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,make great alterations.' I could easily find passages more
6562,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"characteristic than the following; but it is short, it shows that Keats"
6563,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"thought for himself, and it has a curious interest just now (1905):[8]"
6564,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6565,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Notwithstanding the part which the Liberals take in the cause of
6566,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Napoleon, I cannot but think he has done more harm to the life of"
6567,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Liberty than anyone else could have done. Not that the divine right
6568,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"gentlemen have done, or intend to do, any good. No, they have taken a"
6569,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"lesson of him, and will do all the further harm he would have done,"
6570,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,without any of the good. The worst thing he has done is that he has
6571,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,taught them how to organise their monstrous armies. The Emperor
6572,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Alexander, it is said, intends to divide his Empire as did Diocletian,"
6573,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"creating two Czars beside himself, and continuing the supreme monarch"
6574,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"of the whole. Should he do this, and they for a series of years keep"
6575,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"peaceable among themselves, Russia may spread her conquest even to"
6576,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,China. I think it a very likely thing that China itself may fall;
6577,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Turkey certainly will. Meanwhile European North Russia will hold its
6578,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"horns against the rest of Europe, intriguing constantly with France."
6579,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6580,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Still aiming chiefly to show the variety there is in these letters, I"
6581,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,may take next one or two passages which have an interest also from their
6582,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"bearing on Keats's poems. Here we have, for example, the unmistakable"
6583,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,origin of the _Ode on Indolence_:
6584,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6585,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,This morning I am in a sort of temper indolent and supremely careless.
6586,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,I long after a stanza or two of Thomson's _Castle of Indolence_. My
6587,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"passions are all asleep, from my having slumbered till nearly eleven"
6588,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and weakened the animal fibre all over me to a delightful sensation,"
6589,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,about three degrees on this side of faintness. If I had teeth of pearl
6590,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and the breath of lilies, I should call it languor, but as I am* I"
6591,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,must call it laziness. In this state of effeminacy the fibres of the
6592,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"brain are relaxed in common with the rest of the body, and to such a"
6593,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"happy degree that pleasure has no show of enticement, and pain no"
6594,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,unbearable power.[9] Neither Poetry nor Ambition nor Love have any
6595,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,alertness of countenance as they pass by me. They seem rather like
6596,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,figures on a Greek vase--a man and two women whom no one but myself
6597,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"could distinguish in their disguisement. This is the only happiness,"
6598,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,and is a rare instance of the advantage of the body overpowering the
6599,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,mind.[10]
6600,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6601,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,* Especially as I have a black eye.
6602,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6603,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,'This is the only happiness'--the sentence will surprise no one who has
6604,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,even dipped into Keats's letters. It expresses a settled conviction.
6605,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Happiness, he feels, belongs only to childhood and early youth. A young"
6606,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"man thinks he can keep it, but a little experience shows him he must do"
6607,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"without it. The mere growth of the mind, if nothing else, is fatal to"
6608,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"it. To think is to be full of sorrow, because it is to realise the"
6609,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,sorrow of the world and to feel the burden of the mystery. 'Health and
6610,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"spirits,' he says, 'can only belong unalloyed to the selfish man.'[11]"
6611,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Shelley might be speaking. 'To see an entirely disinterested girl quite
6612,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,happy is the most pleasant and extraordinary thing in the world. It
6613,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,depends upon a thousand circumstances. On my word it is extraordinary.
6614,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Women must want Imagination, and they may thank God for it: and so may"
6615,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"we, that a delicate being can feel happy without any sense of"
6616,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"crime.'[12] These passages, taken alone, even when we observe his"
6617,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"qualifications, would give a false impression of Keats; but they supply"
6618,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,a curious commentary on the legend of the sensuous Keats. We may connect
6619,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,with them his feeling of the inferiority of poets (or rather of such
6620,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,'dreaming' poets as himself) to men of action.
6621,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6622,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,In this same letter he copies out for his correspondents several
6623,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"recently written poems, and among them the ballad _La Belle Dame Sans"
6624,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Merci_. He copies it without a word of introduction. He could not say,"
6625,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"'Here is the record of my love and my despair,' for on this one subject"
6626,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,he never opened his heart to his brother. But when he has finished the
6627,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,copy he adds a few lines referring to the stanza (afterwards altered):
6628,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6629,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"She took me to her elfin grot,"
6630,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"And there she wept and sighed full sore,"
6631,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,And there I shut her wild wild eyes
6632,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,With kisses four.
6633,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6634,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"'Why four kisses, you will say, why four? Because I wish to restrain the"
6635,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"headlong impetuosity of my Muse. She would have fain said ""score"""
6636,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"without hurting the rhyme: but we must temper the Imagination, as the"
6637,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Critics say, with Judgment. I was obliged to choose an even number that"
6638,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"both eyes might have fair play; and, to speak truly, I think two apiece"
6639,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"quite sufficient. Suppose I had said seven, there would have been three"
6640,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and a half apiece--a very awkward affair, and well got out of on my"
6641,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,side.' This is not very like the comments of Wordsworth on his best
6642,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"poems, but I dare say the author of _Hamlet_ made such jests about it."
6643,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Is it not strange, let me add, to think that Keats and his friends were"
6644,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,probably unconscious of the extraordinary merit of this poem? It was not
6645,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,published with the Odes in the volume of 1820.
6646,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6647,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"I will quote, finally, three passages to illustrate in different ways"
6648,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Keats's insight into human nature. It appears, on the whole, more"
6649,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"decidedly in the letters than in the poems, and it helps us to believe"
6650,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"that, so far as his gifts were concerned, his hope of ultimate success"
6651,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"in dramatic poetry was well founded. The first is a piece of 'nonsense,'"
6652,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"rattled off on the spur of the moment to amuse his correspondents, and"
6653,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,worth quoting only for its last sentence. He has been describing 'three
6654,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"witty people, all distinct in their excellence'; and he goes on:"
6655,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6656,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"I know three people of no wit at all, each distinct in his"
6657,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"excellence--A, B, and C. A is the foolishest, B the sulkiest, C is a"
6658,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"negative. A makes you yawn, B makes you hate, as for C you never see"
6659,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"him at all though he were six feet high. I bear the first, I forbear"
6660,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"the second, I am not certain that the third is. The first is gruel,"
6661,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"the second ditch-water, the third is spilt--he ought to be wiped up."
6662,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6663,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"C, who is spilt and ought to be wiped up, how often we have met and"
6664,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"still shall meet him! Shakespeare, I think, would gladly have fathered"
6665,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"the phrase that describes him, and the words that follow are not much"
6666,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"out of the tune of Falstaff: 'C, they say, is not his mother's true"
6667,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"child, but she bought him of the man who cries, Young lambs to"
6668,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,sell.'[13]
6669,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6670,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,In the second passage Keats is describing one of his friends:
6671,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6672,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Dilke is a man who cannot feel he has a personal identity unless he
6673,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,has made up his mind about everything. The only means of strengthening
6674,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,one's intellect is to make up one's mind about nothing--to let the
6675,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"mind be a thoroughfare for all thoughts, not a select party. The genus"
6676,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,is not scarce in population: all the stubborn arguers you meet are of
6677,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,the same brood. They never begin on a subject they have not
6678,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"pre-resolved on. They want to hammer their nail into you, and if you"
6679,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"turn the point, still they think you wrong. Dilke will never come at a"
6680,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"truth so long as he lives, because he is always trying at it. He is a"
6681,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Godwin Methodist.[14]
6682,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6683,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,These lines illustrate the instinctive feeling of Keats that it is
6684,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,essential to the growth of the poetic mind to preserve its natural
6685,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,receptiveness and to welcome all the influences that stream in upon it.
6686,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,They illustrate also his dislike of the fixed theories held and preached
6687,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,by some members of his circle. We shall have to consider later the
6688,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"meaning of his occasional outbreaks against 'thought,' 'knowledge,'"
6689,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"'philosophy.' It is important not to be misled by them, and not to"
6690,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,forget the frequent expressions of his feeling that what he lacks and
6691,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,must strive to gain is this very 'knowledge' and 'philosophy.' Here I
6692,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"will only observe that his polemics against them, though coloured by his"
6693,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"temperament, coincide to a large extent with Wordsworth's dislike of 'a"
6694,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"reasoning self-sufficing thing,' his depreciation of mere"
6695,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"book-knowledge, and his praise of a wise passiveness. And, further, what"
6696,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"he objects to here is not the pursuit of truth, it is the 'Methodism,'"
6697,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"the stubborn argument, and the habit of bringing to the argument and"
6698,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,maintaining throughout it a ready-made theory. He offers his own
6699,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,thoughts and speculations freely enough to Bailey and to his
6700,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,brother--men willing to probe with him any serious idea--but not to
6701,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Dilke. It is clear that he neither liked nor rated high the confident
6702,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,assertions and negations of Shelley and his other Godwinian friends and
6703,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,acquaintances. Probably from his ignorance of theories he felt at a
6704,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,disadvantage in talking with them. But he did not dismiss their theories
6705,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"as something of no interest to a poet. He thought about them, convinced"
6706,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"himself that they were fundamentally unsound, and himself philosophises"
6707,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"in criticising them. The following passage, from a letter to George and"
6708,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Georgiana Keats, is the nearest approach to be found in his writings to"
6709,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"a theory of the world, a theology as he jestingly calls it; and although"
6710,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"it is long, I make no apology for quoting it. He has been reading, he"
6711,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"says, Robertson's _History of America_ and Voltaire's _Siècle de Louis"
6712,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"XIV._, and he observes that, though the two civilisations described are"
6713,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"so different, the case of the great body of the people is equally"
6714,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,lamentable in both. And he goes on thus:
6715,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6716,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,The whole appears to resolve into this--that man is originally a poor
6717,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"forked creature, subject to the same mischances as the beasts of the"
6718,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"forest, destined to hardships and disquietude of some kind or other."
6719,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"If he improves by degrees his bodily accommodations and comforts, at"
6720,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"each stage, at each ascent, there are waiting for him a fresh set of"
6721,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"annoyances--he is mortal, and there is still a heaven with its stars"
6722,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,above his head. The most interesting question that can come before us
6723,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"is, How far by the persevering endeavours of a seldom-appearing"
6724,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Socrates mankind may be made happy. I can imagine such happiness
6725,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"carried to an extreme, but what must it end in? Death--and who could"
6726,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"in such a case bear with death? The whole troubles of life, which are"
6727,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"now frittered away in a series of years, would then be accumulated for"
6728,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"the last days of a being who, instead of hailing its approach, would"
6729,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,leave this world as Eve left Paradise. But in truth I do not at all
6730,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,believe in this sort of perfectibility. The nature of the world will
6731,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,not admit of it--the inhabitants of the world will correspond to
6732,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,itself. Let the fish philosophise the ice away from the rivers in
6733,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"winter time, and they shall be at continual play in the tepid delight"
6734,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"of summer. Look at the Poles, and at the sands of Africa--whirlpools"
6735,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and volcanoes. Let men exterminate them, and I will say that they may"
6736,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,arrive at earthly happiness. The point at which man may arrive is as
6737,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"far as the parallel state in inanimate nature, and no further. For"
6738,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"instance, suppose a rose to have sensation; it blooms on a beautiful"
6739,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"morning; it enjoys itself; but then comes a cold wind, a hot sun. It"
6740,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"cannot escape it, it cannot destroy its annoyances--they are as native"
6741,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"to the world as itself. No more can man be happy in spite [?], the"
6742,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,worldly elements will prey upon his nature.
6743,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6744,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,The common cognomen of this world among the misguided and
6745,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"superstitious is 'a vale of tears,' from which we are to be redeemed"
6746,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,by a certain arbitrary interposition of God and taken to Heaven. What
6747,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,a little circumscribed straitened notion! Call the world if you please
6748,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,'The vale of Soul-making.' Then you will find out the use of the world
6749,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"(I am speaking now in the highest terms for human nature, admitting it"
6750,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"to be immortal, which I will here take for granted for the purpose of"
6751,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,showing a thought which has struck me concerning it). I say
6752,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,'_Soul-making_'--Soul as distinguished from an Intelligence.[15] There
6753,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"may be intelligences or sparks of the divinity in millions, but they"
6754,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"are not Souls till they acquire identities, till each one is"
6755,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,personally itself. Intelligences are atoms of perception--they know
6756,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,and they see and they are pure; in short they are God. How then are
6757,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,souls to be made? How then are these sparks which are God to have
6758,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,identity given them--so as ever to possess a bliss peculiar to each
6759,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,one's individual existence? How but by the medium of a world like
6760,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"this? This point I sincerely wish to consider, because I think it a"
6761,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,grander system of salvation than the Christian religion--or rather it
6762,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,is a system of Spirit-creation. This is effected by three grand
6763,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,materials acting the one upon the other for a series of years. These
6764,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"three materials are the _Intelligence_, the _human heart_ (as"
6765,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"distinguished from intelligence or mind), and the World or elemental"
6766,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,space suited for the proper action of _Mind_ and _Heart_ on each other
6767,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,for the purpose of forming the _Soul_ or _Intelligence destined to
6768,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,possess the sense of Identity_. I can scarcely express what I but
6769,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,dimly perceive--and yet I think I perceive it. That you may judge the
6770,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,more clearly I will put it in the most homely form possible. I will
6771,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,call the _world_ a School instituted for the purpose of teaching
6772,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,little children to read. I will call the _human heart_ the horn-book
6773,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"read in that School. And I will call the _Child able to read_, the"
6774,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,_Soul_ made from that School and its horn-book. Do you not see how
6775,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school an Intelligence
6776,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,and make it a Soul? A place where the heart must feel and suffer in a
6777,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"thousand diverse ways. Not merely is the Heart a horn-book, it is the"
6778,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Mind's Bible, it is the mind's experience, it is the text from which"
6779,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,the Mind or Intelligence sucks its identity. As various as the lives
6780,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"of men are, so various become their Souls; and thus does God make"
6781,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"individual beings, Souls, identical Souls, of the sparks of his own"
6782,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,essence. This appears to me a faint sketch of a system of Salvation
6783,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,which does not offend our reason and humanity.[16]
6784,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6785,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Surely, when Keats's education is considered, this, with all its"
6786,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"crudity, is not a little remarkable. It would not be easy to find"
6787,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,anything written at the same age by another poet of the time which shows
6788,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"more openness of mind, more knowledge of human nature, or more original"
6789,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,power of thought.
6790,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6791,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"About a fortnight after Keats wrote that description of A, B, and C, he"
6792,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,received what he recognised at once for his death-warrant. He had yet
6793,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"fourteen months to endure, but at this point the development of his mind"
6794,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"was arrested. During the three preceding years it had been very rapid,"
6795,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and is easy to trace; and it is all the more interesting because, in"
6796,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"spite of its continuity, we are aware of a decided difference between"
6797,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,the Keats of the earlier letters and the Keats of the later. The tour in
6798,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Scotland in the summer of 1818 may be taken with sufficient accuracy as
6799,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,a dividing-line. The earlier Keats is the youth who had written the
6800,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"_Sonnet on first_ _looking into Chapman's Homer_, and _Sleep and"
6801,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Poetry_, and who was writing _Endymion_. He is thoughtful, often grave,"
6802,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"sometimes despondent; but he is full of the enthusiasm of beauty, and of"
6803,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"the joy and fear, the hope and the awe, that accompanied the sense of"
6804,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"poetic power. He is the poet who looked, we are told, as though he had"
6805,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,been gazing on some glorious sight; whose eyes shone and whose face
6806,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,worked with pleasure as he walked in the fields about Hampstead; who is
6807,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,described watching with rapture the billowing of the wind through the
6808,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"trees and over meadow-grasses and corn, and looking sometimes like a"
6809,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,young eagle and sometimes like a wild fawn waiting for some cry from the
6810,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,forest depths. This is the Keats who wrote 'A thing of beauty is a joy
6811,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,for ever'; who found 'the Religion of Joy' in the monuments of the Greek
6812,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"spirit, in sculpture and vases, and mere translations and mere handbooks"
6813,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"of mythology; who never ceased, he said, to wonder at all that incarnate"
6814,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"delight, and would point out to Severn how essentially modern, how"
6815,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"imperishable, the Greek spirit is--a joy for ever."
6816,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6817,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Yet, as we have seen already, he was aware, and we find him becoming"
6818,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"more and more aware, that joy is not the only word. He had not read for"
6819,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"nothing Wordsworth's great Ode, and _Tintern Abbey_, and the"
6820,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"_Excursion_. We know it from _Endymion_, and the letter about the"
6821,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,'burden of the mystery' was written before the tour in Scotland. But
6822,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"after this we feel a more decided change, doubtless hastened by outward"
6823,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,events. The Blackwood and Quarterly reviews of _Endymion_
6824,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,appeared--reviews not less inexcusable because we understand their
6825,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,origin. Then came his brother's death. A few weeks later he met Miss
6826,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Brawne. Henceforth his youth has vanished. There are traces of morbid
6827,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"feeling in the change, painful traces; but they are connected, I think,"
6828,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,solely with his passion. His brother's death deepened his sympathies.
6829,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"The reviews, so long as health remained to him, did him nothing but"
6830,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"good. He rated them at their true value, but they gave him a salutary"
6831,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"shock. They quickened his perception, already growing keen, of the"
6832,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,weaknesses and mannerism of Hunt's verse and his own. Through them he
6833,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"saw a false but useful picture of himself, as a silly boy, dandled into"
6834,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"self-worship by foolish friends, and posturing as a man of genius. He"
6835,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"kept his faith in his genius, but he felt that he must prove it. He"
6836,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"became impatient of dreaming. Poetry, he felt, is not mere luxury and"
6837,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"rapture, it is a deed. We trace at times a kind of fierceness. He turns"
6838,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"against his old self harshly. Some of his friends, he says, think he has"
6839,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"lost his old poetic ardour, and perhaps they are right. He speaks"
6840,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"slightingly of wonders, even of scenery: the human heart is something"
6841,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"finer,--not its dreams, but its actions and its anguish. His gaze is as"
6842,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"intent as ever,--more intent; but the glory he would see walks in a"
6843,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"fiery furnace, and to see it he must think and learn. He is young, he"
6844,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"says, writing at random, straining his eyes at particles of light in the"
6845,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,midst of a great darkness. He knows at times the 'agony' of ignorance.
6846,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"In one year he writes six or seven of the best poems in the language,"
6847,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"but he is little satisfied. 'Thus far,' he says, 'I have a consciousness"
6848,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"of having been pretty dull and heavy, both in subject and phrase.' Two"
6849,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"months later he ends a note to Haydon with the words, 'I am afraid I"
6850,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,shall pop off just when my mind is able to run alone.' And so it was.
6851,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6852,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,It is important to remember this change in Keats in considering his
6853,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,ideas about poetry; but we have first to look at them in a more general
6854,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,way. Many of the most interesting occur in detached remarks or
6855,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"aphorisms, and these I must pass by. The others I intended at first to"
6856,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"deal with in connection with Shelley's view of poetry; and, although"
6857,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"that plan proved to be too large for a single lecture, I do not wish"
6858,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"altogether to abandon it, because in the extracts which I have been"
6859,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,reading the difference between the minds of the two poets has already
6860,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"appeared, and because it re-appears both in their poetic practice and in"
6861,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"their opinions about their art. Indeed, with so much difference, it"
6862,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,might be thought unlikely that these opinions would show also a marked
6863,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"resemblance. For Keats, it may be said, was of all the great poets then"
6864,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"alive the one least affected by the spirit of the time, or by that"
6865,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,'revolutionary' atmosphere of which I spoke in a previous lecture. He
6866,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"did not concern himself, we may be told, with the progress of humanity,"
6867,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,or with Manchester Massacres or risings in Naples. He cared nothing for
6868,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"theories, abstractions, or ideals. He worshipped Beauty, not Liberty;"
6869,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and the beauty he worshipped was not 'intellectual,' but visible,"
6870,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"audible, tangible. 'O for a life of sensations,' he cried, 'rather than"
6871,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"of thoughts.' He was an artist, intent upon fashioning his material"
6872,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,until the outward sensible form is perfectly expressive and delightful.
6873,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,In all this he was at the opposite pole to Shelley; and he himself felt
6874,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"it. He refused to visit Shelley, in order that he might keep his own"
6875,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"unfettered scope; and he never speaks of Shelley cordially. He told him,"
6876,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"too, that he might be more of an artist and load every rift of his"
6877,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"subject with ore; and that, while many people regard the purpose of a"
6878,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"work as the God, and the poetry as the Mammon, an artist must serve"
6879,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Mammon. And his practice, like his opinions, proves that, both in his"
6880,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"strength and his limitations, he belongs to quite a different type."
6881,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6882,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,In such a plea there would certainly be much truth; and yet it is not
6883,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"_the_ truth, for it ignores other truths which must somehow be combined"
6884,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"with it. There are great differences between the two poets, but then in"
6885,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Keats himself there are contending strains. Along with the differences,"
6886,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"too, we find very close affinities. And these affinities with Shelley"
6887,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,also show that Keats was deeply influenced by the spirit of his time.
6888,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Let me illustrate these statements.
6889,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6890,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"The poet who cried, 'O for a life of sensations,' was consoled, as his"
6891,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"life withered away, by the remembrance that he 'had loved the principle"
6892,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,of beauty in all things.' And this is not a chance expression; it
6893,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"repeats, for instance, a phrase used two years before, 'the mighty"
6894,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,abstract idea I have of Beauty in all things.' If Shelley had used this
6895,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"language, it would be taken to prove his love of abstractions. How does"
6896,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,it differ from the language of the _Hymn to Intellectual Beauty_?[17]
6897,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6898,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Again, we noticed in a previous lecture the likeness between _Alastor_"
6899,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and _Endymion_, each the first poem of any length in which the writer's"
6900,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,genius decisively declared itself. Both tell the story of a young poet;
6901,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"of a dream in which his ideal appears in human form, and he knows the"
6902,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"rapture of union with it; of the passion thus enkindled, and the search"
6903,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,for its complete satisfaction. We may prefer to read _Endymion_ simply
6904,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,as we read _Isabella_; but the question here is not of our preferences.
6905,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"If we examine the poem without regard to them, we shall be unable to"
6906,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,doubt that to some extent the story symbolises or allegorises this
6907,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,pursuit of the principle of beauty by the poetic soul. This is one of
6908,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,the causes of its failure as a narrative. Keats had not in himself the
6909,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"experience required by parts of his design, and hence in them he had to"
6910,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"write from mere imagination. And the poem, besides, shows in a flagrant"
6911,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,degree the defect felt here and there in _Prometheus Unbound_. If we
6912,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"wish to read it as the author meant it, we must ask for the significance"
6913,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"of the figures, events, and actions. Yet it is clear that not all of"
6914,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"them are intended to have this further significance, and we are"
6915,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"perplexed by the question where, and how far, we are to look for it.[18]"
6916,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6917,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Take, again, some of the most famous of the lyrical poems. Is it true"
6918,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,that Keats was untroubled by that sense of contrast between ideal and
6919,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,real which haunted Shelley and was so characteristic of the time? So far
6920,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,is this from being the case that a critic might more plausibly object to
6921,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,his monotonous insistence on that contrast. Probably the best-known
6922,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,lyrics of the two poets are the stanzas _To a Skylark_ and the _Ode to a
6923,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Nightingale_. Well, if we summarise prosaically the subject of the one"
6924,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,poem we have summarised that of the other. 'Our human life is all unrest
6925,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and sorrow, an oscillation between longing and satiety, a looking before"
6926,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and after. We are aware of a perfection that we cannot attain, and that"
6927,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"leaves us dissatisfied by everything attainable. And we die, and do not"
6928,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,understand death. But the bird is beyond this division and dissonance;
6929,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,it attains the ideal;
6930,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6931,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Das Unzulängliche,"
6932,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Hier wird's Ereigniss.'
6933,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6934,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"This is the burden of both poems. In style, metre, tone, atmosphere,"
6935,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,they are far apart; the 'idea' is identical. And what else is the idea
6936,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"of the _Ode_ _on a Grecian Urn_, where a moment, arrested in its"
6937,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"ideality by art and made eternal, is opposed to the change and decay of"
6938,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,reality? And what else is the idea of the playful lines _To
6939,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Fancy_,--Fancy who brings together the joys which in life are parted by"
6940,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"distances of time and place, and who holds in sure possession what life"
6941,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,wins only to lose? Even a poem so pictorial and narrative and free from
6942,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,symbolism as the _The Eve of St. Agnes_ rests on the same feeling. The
6943,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"contrast, so exquisitely imagined and conveyed, between the cold, the"
6944,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"storm, the old age, the empty pleasure and noisy enmity of the world"
6945,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"outside Madeline's chamber, and the glow, the hush, the rich and dreamy"
6946,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"bliss within it, is in effect the contrast which inspired the _Ode to a"
6947,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Nightingale_.
6948,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6949,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"It would be easy to pursue this subject. It would be easy, too, to show"
6950,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,that Keats was far from indifferent to the 'progress of humanity.' He
6951,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"conceived it in his own way, but it is as much the theme of _Hyperion_"
6952,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,as of _Prometheus Unbound_. We are concerned however here not with the
6953,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"interpretation of his poems, but with his view of poetry, and especially"
6954,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,with certain real or apparent inconsistencies in it. For in the letters
6955,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"he now praises 'sensation' and decries thought or knowledge, and now"
6956,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,cries out for 'knowledge' as his greatest need; in one place declares
6957,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"that an artist must have self-concentration, perhaps selfishness, and in"
6958,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,others insists that what he desires is to be of use to his fellow-men.
6959,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,We shall gain light on these matters and on his relation to Shelley if I
6960,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,try to reduce his general view to a precise and prosaic form.
6961,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6962,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,That which the poet seeks is Beauty. Beauty is a 'principle'; it is One.
6963,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"All things beautiful manifest it, and so far therefore are one and the"
6964,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,same. This idea of the unity of all beauty comes out in many crucial
6965,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,passages in the poems and letters. I take a single example. The goddess
6966,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Cynthia in _Endymion_ is the Principle of Beauty. In this story she is
6967,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"also identified with the Moon. Accordingly the hero, gazing at the moon,"
6968,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,declares that in all that he ever loved he loved _her_:
6969,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6970,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,thou wast the deep glen--
6971,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Thou wast the mountain-top--the sage's pen--
6972,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,The poet's harp--the voice of friends--the sun;
6973,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Thou wast the river--thou wast glory won;
6974,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Thou wast my clarion's blast--thou wast my steed--
6975,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,My goblet full of wine--my topmost deed:--
6976,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Thou wast the charm of women, lovely Moon!"
6977,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,O what a wild and harmonised tune
6978,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,My spirit struck from all the beautiful!
6979,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6980,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,When he says this he does not yet understand that the Moon and his
6981,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"strange visitant are one; he thinks they are rivals. So later, when he"
6982,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"loves the Indian maid, and is in despair because he fancies himself"
6983,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"therefore false to his goddess, he is in error; for she is only his"
6984,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"goddess veiled, the shaded half of the moon."
6985,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
6986,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Still the mountain-top and the voice of friends differ. Indeed, the one"
6987,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Beauty is infinitely various. But its manifestations, for Keats, tend to"
6988,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,fall into two main classes. On the one hand there is the kind of beauty
6989,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,that comes easily and is all sweetness and pleasure. In receiving it we
6990,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,seem to suppress nothing in our nature. Though it is not merely
6991,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"sensuous, for the Principle of Beauty is in it, it speaks to sense and"
6992,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"delights us. It is 'luxury.' But the other kind is won through thought,"
6993,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,and also through pain. And this second and more difficult kind is also
6994,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"the higher, the fuller, the nearer to the Principle. That it is won"
6995,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"through pain is doubly true. First, because the poet cannot reach it"
6996,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"unless he consents to suffer painful sympathies, which disturb his"
6997,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"enjoyment of the simpler and sweeter beauty, and may even seem to lead"
6998,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,him away from beauty altogether. Thus Endymion can attain union with his
6999,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"goddess only by leaving the green hill-sides where he met her first, and"
7000,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,by wandering unhappily in cold moonless regions inside the earth and
7001,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"under the sea. Here he feels for the woes of other lovers, and to help"
7002,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,them undertakes tasks which seem to interrupt his search for Cynthia.
7003,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Returning to earth he becomes enamoured of a maiden devoted to sorrow,"
7004,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,and gains his goddess just when he thinks he has resigned her. The
7005,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"highest beauty, then, is reached through the poet's pain; and, in the"
7006,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"second place, it has pain in itself, or at least appears in objects that"
7007,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,are painful. In his early poem _Sleep and Poetry_ Keats asks himself the
7008,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"question,"
7009,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7010,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,And can I ever bid these joys farewell?
7011,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7012,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,And he answers:
7013,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7014,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Yes, I must pass them for a nobler life,"
7015,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Where I may find the agonies, the strife"
7016,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Of human hearts.
7017,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7018,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,He felt himself as yet unequal to this task. He never became equal to
7019,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"it, but the idea was realised to some extent in _Isabella_ and _Lamia_"
7020,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and _Hyperion_. The first two of these are tales of passion, 'agony,'"
7021,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and death. The third, obviously, is on one side a story of 'strife.'"
7022,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7023,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Such, in its bare outline, is Keats's habitual view of poetry. What,"
7024,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"then, are the points where, in spite of its evident resemblance to"
7025,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Shelley's, we feel a marked difference? The most important seem to be"
7026,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,two. In the first place Keats lays far the heavier stress on the idea
7027,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,that beauty is manifested in suffering and conflict. The idea itself is
7028,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"to be found in Shelley, but (as we saw in another lecture) it is not"
7029,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,congenial to him; it appears almost incidentally and is stated
7030,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,half-heartedly; and of the further idea that beauty is not only
7031,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"manifested in this sphere, but is there manifested most fully, we find,"
7032,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"I believe, no trace. And this was inevitable; for the whole tendency of"
7033,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Shelley's mind was to regard suffering and conflict with mere distress
7034,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and horror as something senseless and purely evil, and to look on the"
7035,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"world as naturally a paradise entirely free from them, but ruined by an"
7036,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,inexplicable failure on the part of man. To this world of woe his
7037,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Intellectual Beauty does not really belong; it appears there only in
7038,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"flashes; its true home is a place where no contradictions, not even"
7039,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"reconciled contradictions, exist. The idealism of Keats is much more"
7040,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,concrete. He has no belief either in this natural paradise or in
7041,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,'Godwinian perfectibility.' Pain and conflict have a meaning to him.
7042,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Without them souls could not be made; and the business of the world, he"
7043,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"conjectures, is the making of souls. They are not therefore simply"
7044,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"obstacles to the ideal. On the contrary, in this world it manifests"
7045,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"itself most fully in and through them. For 'scenery is fine, but human"
7046,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,nature is finer';[19] and the passions and actions of man are finer than
7047,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"his enjoyments and dreams. In the same way, the conflict in _Hyperion_"
7048,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"is not one between light and darkness, the ideal and mere might, as in"
7049,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"_Prometheus Unbound_. The Titans must yield to the Olympians because, in"
7050,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"a word, they are less beautiful, and"
7051,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7052,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,'tis the eternal law
7053,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,That first in beauty should be first in might.
7054,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7055,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"But the Titans, though less beautiful, _are_ beautiful; it is one and"
7056,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,the same 'principle' that manifests itself in them and more fully in
7057,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"their victors. Their defeat therefore is not, in the end, defeat, but"
7058,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"the completion of their own being. This, it seems probable, the hero in"
7059,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"_Hyperion_ would have come to recognise, so that the poem, at least so"
7060,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"far as he is concerned, would have ended with a reconciliation born of"
7061,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,strife.
7062,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7063,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Man is 'finer,' Keats says, and the Titans must submit because they are"
7064,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,less 'beautiful.' The second point of difference between him and
7065,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,Shelley lies in this emphasis on beauty. The ideal with Shelley has many
7066,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"names, and one of them is beauty, but we hardly feel it to be the name"
7067,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,nearest to his heart. The spirit of his worship is rather
7068,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7069,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,that sustaining Love
7070,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Which, through the web of being blindly wove"
7071,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"By man and beast and earth and air and sea,"
7072,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of"
7073,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,The fire for which all thirst;
7074,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7075,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and 'love' is a word less distinctively aesthetic, if the term must be"
7076,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"used, than 'beauty.' But the ideal for Keats is always and emphatically"
7077,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,beauty or the 'principle of beauty.' When he sets the agonies and
7078,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"strifes of human hearts above a painless or luxurious loveliness, it is"
7079,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,because they are the more beautiful. He would not have said that the
7080,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"_Midsummer Night's Dream_ is superior to _King Lear_ in beauty, but"
7081,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,inferior to it in some other respect; it is inferior in _beauty_ to
7082,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"_King Lear_. Let art only be 'intense' enough, let the poet only look"
7083,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"hard enough and feel with force enough, so that the pain in his object"
7084,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"is seen truly as the vesture of great passion and action, and all"
7085,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"'disagreeables' will 'evaporate,' and nothing will remain but"
7086,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"beauty.[20] Hence, though well aware how little he has as yet of the"
7087,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"great poet's power of vision, he is still content when he can feel that"
7088,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"a poem of his has intensity, has (as he says of _Lamia_) 'that sort of"
7089,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,fire in it that must take hold of people some way.'[21] And an earlier
7090,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and inferior poem, _Isabella_, may show his mind. The mere subject is"
7091,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"exceedingly painful, and Keats by no means suppresses the painful"
7092,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,incidents and details; but the poem can hardly be called painful at all;
7093,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"for the final impression is that of beauty, almost as decidedly so as"
7094,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,the final impression left by the blissful story of _St. Agnes' Eve_. And
7095,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,this is most characteristic of Keats. If the word beauty is used in his
7096,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"sense, and not in the common contracted sense, we may truly say that he"
7097,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"was, and must have remained, more than any other poet of his time, a"
7098,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,worshipper of Beauty.
7099,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7100,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"When, then--to come to his apparent inconsistencies--he exalts sensation"
7101,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and decries thought or knowledge, what he is crying out for is beauty."
7102,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"The word 'sensation,' as a comparison of passages would readily show,"
7103,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,has not in his letters its usual meaning. It stands for _poetic_
7104,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"sensation, and, indeed, for much more. It is, to speak broadly, a name"
7105,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,for _all_ poetic or imaginative experience; and the contents of the
7106,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"speech of Oceanus are, in kind, just as much 'sensation' as the eating"
7107,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"of nectarines (which may well be poetic to the poetic). This is, I"
7108,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"repeat, to speak broadly. For it is true that sometimes in the earlier"
7109,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,letters we find Keats false to his better mind. Knowing that the more
7110,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"difficult beauty is the fuller, he is yet, to our great advantage, so"
7111,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"entranced by the delight or glory of the easier, that he rebels against"
7112,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,everything that would disturb its magic or trouble his 'exquisite sense
7113,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,of the luxurious.' And then he is tempted to see in thought only that
7114,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"vexatious questioning that 'spoils the singing of the nightingale,' and"
7115,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,to forget that it is necessary to the fuller and more difficult kind of
7116,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,beauty. But these moods are occasional. He knew that there was something
7117,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"wilful and weak about them; and they gradually disappear. On the whole,"
7118,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,the gist of his attitude to 'thought' or 'philosophy' may be stated as
7119,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,follows.
7120,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7121,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"He was far from being indifferent to truth, or from considering it"
7122,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"unimportant for poetry. In an early letter, when he criticises a poem of"
7123,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Wordsworth's, he ventures to say that 'if Wordsworth had thought a"
7124,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"little deeper at that moment he would not have written it,' and that 'it"
7125,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"is a kind of sketchy intellectual landscape, not a search after"
7126,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,truth.'[22] He writes of a passage in _Endymion_: 'The whole thing
7127,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"must, I think, have appeared to you, who are a consecutive man, as a"
7128,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"thing almost of mere words, but I assure you that, when I wrote it, it"
7129,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,was the regular stepping of Imagination towards a truth.'[23] And many
7130,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,passages show his conviction that for his progress towards this truth
7131,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"'thought,' 'knowledge,' 'philosophy,' are indispensable;[24] that he"
7132,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"must submit to the toil and the solitude that they involve, just as he"
7133,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"must undergo the pains of sympathy; that 'there is but one way for him,'"
7134,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and that this one 'road lies through application, study, and"
7135,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"thought.'[25] On the other hand he had, in the first place, as we saw, a"
7136,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"strong feeling that a man, and especially a poet, must not be in a hurry"
7137,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"to arrive at results, and must not shut up his mind in the box of his"
7138,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"supposed results, but must be content with half-knowledge, and capable"
7139,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"of 'living in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable"
7140,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"reaching after fact and reason.' And, in the second place, a poet, he"
7141,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"felt, will never be able to rest in thoughts and reasonings which do not"
7142,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,also satisfy imagination and give a truth which is also beauty; and in
7143,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"so far as they fail to do this, in so far as they are _mere_ thoughts"
7144,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and reasonings, they are no more than a means, though a necessary means,"
7145,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"to an end, which end is beauty,--that beauty which is also truth. This"
7146,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"alone is the poet's end, and therefore his law. 'With a great poet the"
7147,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"sense of beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather"
7148,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"obliterates all consideration.'[26] Thought, knowledge, philosophy, if"
7149,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"they fall short of this, are nothing but a 'road' to his goal. They"
7150,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,bring matter for him to mould to his purpose of beauty; but he must not
7151,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"allow them to impose _their_ purpose on him, or to ask that it shall"
7152,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,appear in his product. These statements formulate Keats's position more
7153,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"than he formulates it, but I believe that they represent it truly. He"
7154,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"was led to it mainly by the poetic instinct in him, or because, while"
7155,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"his mind had much general power, he was, more than Wordsworth or"
7156,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Coleridge or Shelley, a poet pure and simple.[27]"
7157,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7158,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,We can now deal more briefly with another apparent inconsistency. Keats
7159,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"says again and again that the poet must not live for himself, but must"
7160,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,feel for others and try to help them; that 'there is no worthy pursuit
7161,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,but the idea of doing some good for the world'; that he is ambitious to
7162,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,do some good or to serve his country. Yet he writes to Shelley about the
7163,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,_Cenci_: 'There is only one part of it I am judge of--the poetry and
7164,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"dramatic effect, which by many spirits nowadays is considered the Mammon."
7165,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"A modern work, it is said, must have a purpose, which may be the God. An"
7166,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"artist must serve Mammon; he must have ""self-concentration""--selfishness,"
7167,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"perhaps.'[28] These are ungracious sentences, especially when we remember"
7168,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,the letter to which Keats is replying; and they are also unfair to
7169,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Shelley, whose tragedy cannot justly be accused of having an ultra-poetic"
7170,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"purpose, and whose Count Cenci shows much more dramatic imagination than"
7171,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,any figure drawn by Keats. But it is ungracious too to criticise the
7172,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,irritability of a man condemned to death; and in any case these sentences
7173,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,are perfectly consistent with Keats's expressed desire to do good. The
7174,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"poet is to do good; yes, but by being a poet. He is to have a purpose of"
7175,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"doing good by his poetry; yes, but he is not to obtrude it in his"
7176,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"poetry, or to show that he has a design upon us.[29] To make beauty is"
7177,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,_his_ philanthropy. He will not succeed in it best by making what is only
7178,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"in part beauty,--something like the _Excursion_, half poem and half"
7179,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"lecture. He must be unselfish, no doubt, but perhaps by being selfish; by"
7180,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"refusing, that is, to be diverted from his poetic way of helping by the"
7181,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,desire to help in another way. This is the drift of Keats's thought. If
7182,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"we remember what he means by 'beauty' and 'poet,' and how he"
7183,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"distinguishes the poet from the 'dreamer,'[30] we shall think it sound"
7184,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,doctrine.
7185,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7186,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Keats was by nature both dreamer and poet, and his ambition was to"
7187,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"become poet pure and simple. There was, in a further sense, a double"
7188,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"strain in his nature. He had in him the poetic temper of his time, the"
7189,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"ever-present sense of an infinite, the tendency to think of this as an"
7190,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"ideal perfection manifesting itself in reality, and yet surpassing"
7191,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"reality, and so capable of being contrasted with it. He was allied here"
7192,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"especially to Wordsworth and to Shelley, by the former of whom he was"
7193,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,greatly influenced. But there was also in him another tendency; and
7194,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"this, it would seem, was strengthening at the expense of the first, and"
7195,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,would in time have dominated it. It was perhaps the deeper and more
7196,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"individual. It may be called the Shakespearean strain, and it works"
7197,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"against any inclination to erect walls between ideal and real, or to"
7198,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,magnify differences of grade into oppositions of kind. Keats had the
7199,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"impulse to interest himself in everything he saw or heard of, to be"
7200,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"curious about a thing, accept it, identify himself with it, without"
7201,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"first asking whether it is better or worse than another, or how far it"
7202,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,is from the ideal principle. It is this impulse that speaks in the
7203,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"words, 'If a sparrow come before my window, I take part in its existence"
7204,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and pick about the gravel';[31] and in the words, 'When she comes into a"
7205,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,room she makes an impression the same as the beauty of a leopardess';
7206,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and in the feeling that she is fine, though Bishop Hooker is finer. It"
7207,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"too is the source of his complaint that he has no personal identity, and"
7208,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,of his description of the poetical character; 'It has no self; it is
7209,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"everything and nothing.... It enjoys light and shade; it lives in gusto,"
7210,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"be it foul or fair, high or low, rich or poor, mean or elevated. It has"
7211,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,as much delight in conceiving an Iago as an Imogen. What shocks the
7212,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,virtuous philosopher delights the chameleon poet. It does no harm from
7213,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"its relish of the dark side of things, any more than from its taste for"
7214,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"the bright one, because they both end in speculation.[32] A poet is the"
7215,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"most unpoetical of anything in existence, because he has no identity. He"
7216,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"is continually in, for, and filling some other body.'[33] That is not a"
7217,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,description of Milton or Wordsworth or Shelley; neither does it apply
7218,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,very fully to Keats; but it describes something at least of the spirit
7219,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,of Shakespeare.
7220,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,
7221,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Now this spirit, it is obvious, tends in poetry, I do not say to a"
7222,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"realistic, but to what may be called a concrete method of treatment; to"
7223,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"the vivid presentment of scenes, individualities, actions, in preference"
7224,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,to the expression of unembodied thoughts and feelings. The atmosphere of
7225,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"Wordsworth's age, as we have seen, was not, on the whole, favourable to"
7226,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"it, and in various degrees it failed in strength, or it suffered, in all"
7227,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,the greater poets. Scott had it in splendid abundance and vigour; but
7228,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,he had too little of the idealism or the metaphysical imagination which
7229,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"was common to those poets, and which Shakespeare united with his"
7230,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"universal comprehension; nor was he, like Shakespeare and like some of"
7231,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"them, a master of magic in language. But Keats had that magic in fuller"
7232,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"measure, perhaps, than any of our poets since Milton; and, sharing the"
7233,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"idealism of Wordsworth and Shelley, he possessed also wider sympathies,"
7234,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"and, if not a more plastic or pictorial imagination than the latter, at"
7235,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,least a greater freedom from the attraction of theoretic ideas. To what
7236,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,results might not this combination have led if his life had been as long
7237,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"as Wordsworth's or even as Byron's? It would be more than hazardous, I"
7238,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"think, to say that he was the most highly endowed of all our poets in"
7239,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,"the nineteenth century, but he might well have written its greatest long"
7240,THE LETTERS OF KEATS,poems.

7247,NOTE,I have pointed out certain marked resemblances between _Alastor_ and
7248,NOTE,"_Endymion_, and it would be easy to extend the list. These resemblances"
7249,NOTE,"are largely due to similarities in the minds of the two poets, and to"
7250,NOTE,"the action of a common influence on both. But I believe that, in"
7251,NOTE,"addition, Keats was affected by the reading of _Alastor_, which appeared"
7252,NOTE,"in 1816, while his own poem was begun in the spring of 1817."
7253,NOTE,
7254,NOTE,"The common influence to which I refer was that of Wordsworth, and"

7256,NOTE,"or rather a misquotation, from it in the Preface to _Alastor_. The"
7257,NOTE,_Excursion_ is concerned in part with the danger of inactive and
7258,NOTE,"unsympathetic solitude; and this, treated of course in Shelley's own"
7259,NOTE,"way, is the subject of _Alastor_, which also contains phrases"
7260,NOTE,reminiscent of Wordsworth's poem. Its Preface too reminds one
7261,NOTE,immediately of the _Elegiac Stanzas on a Picture of Peele Castle_; of
7262,NOTE,"the main idea, and of the lines,"

7274,NOTE,would naturally read it. In comparing that poem with _Endymion_ I am
7275,NOTE,obliged to repeat remarks already made in the lecture.
7276,NOTE,
7277,NOTE,"_Alastor_, composed under the influence described, tells of the fate of"
7278,NOTE,"a young poet, who is 'pure and tender-hearted,' but who, in his search"
7279,NOTE,"for communion with the ideal influences of nature and of knowledge,"
7280,NOTE,keeps aloof from sympathies with his kind. 'So long as it is possible
7281,NOTE,"for his desires to point towards objects thus infinite and unmeasured,"
7282,NOTE,he is joyous and tranquil and self-possessed.' But a time comes when he
7283,NOTE,thirsts for intercourse with an intelligence like himself. His ideal
7284,NOTE,requirements are embodied in the form of a being who appears to him in a
7285,NOTE,"dream, and to whom he is united in passionate love. But his"
7286,NOTE,'self-centred seclusion' now avenges itself. The 'spirit of sweet human
7287,NOTE,"love' vanishes as he wakes, and he wanders over the earth, vainly"
7288,NOTE,seeking the 'prototype' of the vision until he dies.
7289,NOTE,
7290,NOTE,"In _Endymion_ the story of a dream-vision, of rapturous union with it,"
7291,NOTE,"and of the consequent pursuit of it, re-appears, though the beginning"
7292,NOTE,"and the end are different. The hero, before the coming of the vision,"
7293,NOTE,"has of course a poetic soul, but he is not self-secluded, or inactive,"
7294,NOTE,"or fragile, or philosophic; and his pursuit of the goddess leads not to"
7295,NOTE,"extinction but to immortal union with her. It does lead, however, to"
7296,NOTE,adventures of which the main idea evidently is that the poetic soul can
7297,NOTE,only reach complete union with the ideal (which union is immortality) by
7298,NOTE,wandering in a world which seems to deprive him of it; by trying to
7299,NOTE,mitigate the woes of others instead of seeking the ideal for himself;
7300,NOTE,"and by giving himself up to love for what seems to be a mere woman, but"
7301,NOTE,is found to be the goddess herself. It seems almost beyond doubt that
7302,NOTE,the story of Cynthia and Endymion would not have taken this shape but
7303,NOTE,for _Alastor_.
7304,NOTE,
7305,NOTE,The reader will find this impression confirmed if he compares the
7306,NOTE,"descriptions in _Alastor_ and _Endymion_, Book I., of the dreamer's"
7307,NOTE,"feelings on awakening from his dream, of the disenchantment that has"
7308,NOTE,"fallen on the landscape, and of his 'eager' pursuit of the lost vision."
7309,NOTE,"Everything is, in one sense, different, for the two poets differ"
7310,NOTE,"greatly, and Keats, of course, was writing without any conscious"
7311,NOTE,recollection of the passage in _Alastor_; but the conception is the
7312,NOTE,same.[34]
7313,NOTE,
7314,NOTE,"Consider, again, the passage (near the beginning of _Endymion_, Book"
7315,NOTE,III.) quoted on p. 230 of the lecture. The hero is addressing the moon;
7316,NOTE,"and he says, to put it baldly, that from his boyhood everything that was"
7317,NOTE,beautiful to him was associated with his love of the moon's beauty. The
7318,NOTE,passage continues thus:
7319,NOTE,
7320,NOTE,"On some bright essence could I lean, and lull"
7321,NOTE,Myself to immortality: I prest
7322,NOTE,Nature's soft pillow in a wakeful rest.
7323,NOTE,"But, gentle Orb! there came a nearer bliss--"
7324,NOTE,My strange love came--Felicity's abyss!
7325,NOTE,"She came, and thou didst fade, and fade away."
7326,NOTE,
7327,NOTE,"In spite of the dissimilarities, surely the 'wakeful rest' here"
7328,NOTE,corresponds to the condition of the poet in _Alastor_ prior to the
7329,NOTE,dream. 'So long as it is possible for his desires to point towards
7330,NOTE,"objects thus infinite and unmeasured, he is joyous and tranquil and"
7331,NOTE,"self-possessed'; but when his 'strange love' comes these objects, like"
7332,NOTE,"the objects of Endymion's earlier desires, no longer suffice him."
7333,NOTE,
7334,NOTE,"There is, however, further evidence, indeed positive proof, of the"
7335,NOTE,"effect of _Alastor_, and especially of its Preface, on Keats's mind. In"
7336,NOTE,"the revised version of _Hyperion_, Book I., the dreamer in the Temple"
7337,NOTE,wonders why he has been preserved from death. The Prophetess tells him
7338,NOTE,the reason (I italicise certain words):
7339,NOTE,
7340,NOTE,"'None can usurp this height,' returned that shade,"
7341,NOTE,'But those to whom the _miseries of the world_
7342,NOTE,"Are misery, and will not let them rest."
7343,NOTE,"_All else_ who find a haven in the world,"
7344,NOTE,"Where they may thoughtless sleep away their days,"
7345,NOTE,"If by a chance into this fane they come,"
7346,NOTE,Rot on the pavement where thou rottedst half.'
7347,NOTE,"'Are there not thousands in the world,' said I,"
7348,NOTE,"Encouraged by the sooth voice of the shade,"
7349,NOTE,"'Who _love their fellows_ even to the death,"
7350,NOTE,"Who feel the giant agony of the world,"
7351,NOTE,"And more, like slaves to poor humanity,"
7352,NOTE,Labour for mortal good?'
7353,NOTE,
7354,NOTE,If the reader compares with this the following passage from the Preface
7355,NOTE,"to _Alastor_, and if he observes the words I have italicised in it, he"
7356,NOTE,will hardly doubt that some unconscious recollection of the Preface was
7357,NOTE,at work in Keats's mind. Shelley is distinguishing the self-centred
7358,NOTE,seclusion of his poet from that of common selfish souls:
7359,NOTE,
7360,NOTE,'The picture is not barren of instruction to actual men. The Poet's
7361,NOTE,self-centred seclusion was avenged by the furies of an irresistible
7362,NOTE,passion pursuing him to speedy ruin. But that Power which strikes the
7363,NOTE,"luminaries of the world with sudden darkness and extinction, by"
7364,NOTE,"awakening them to too exquisite a perception of its influences, dooms to"
7365,NOTE,a slow and poisonous decay those meaner spirits that dare to abjure its
7366,NOTE,dominion. Their destiny is more abject and inglorious as their
7367,NOTE,"delinquency is more contemptible and pernicious. They who, deluded by no"
7368,NOTE,"generous error, instigated by no sacred thirst of doubtful knowledge,"
7369,NOTE,"duped by no illustrious superstition, loving nothing on this earth, and"
7370,NOTE,"cherishing no hopes beyond, yet keep aloof from sympathies with their"
7371,NOTE,"kind, rejoicing neither in human joy nor mourning with human grief;"
7372,NOTE,"these, and such as they, have their apportioned curse. They languish,"
7373,NOTE,because none feel with them their common nature. They are morally dead.
7374,NOTE,"They are neither friends, nor lovers, nor fathers, nor citizens of the"
7375,NOTE,"world, nor benefactors of their country. Among those who attempt to"
7376,NOTE,"exist without human sympathy, the pure and tender-hearted perish through"
7377,NOTE,"the intensity and passion of their search after its communities, when"
7378,NOTE,"the vacancy of their spirit suddenly makes itself felt. _All else_,"
7379,NOTE,"selfish, blind, and torpid, are those unforeseeing multitudes who"
7380,NOTE,"constitute, together with their own, the lasting _misery_ and loneliness"
7381,NOTE,"_of the world_. Those who _love not their fellow-beings_, live"
7382,NOTE,"unfruitful lives, and prepare for their old age a miserable grave.'[35]"
7383,NOTE,
7384,NOTE,I have still a passage to refer to. Let the reader turn to the quotation
7385,NOTE,on p. 236 from Keats's reply to Shelley's letter of invitation to his
7386,NOTE,home in Italy; and let him ask himself why Keats puts the word
7387,NOTE,"""self-concentration"" in inverted commas. He is not referring to anything"
7388,NOTE,"in Shelley's letter, and he is not in the habit in the letters of using"
7389,NOTE,"inverted commas except to mark a quotation. Without doubt, I think, he"
7390,NOTE,is referring from memory to the Preface to _Alastor_ and the phrase
7391,NOTE,'self-centred seclusion.' He has come to feel that this self-centred
7392,NOTE,"seclusion is _right_ for a poet like himself, and that the direct"
7393,NOTE,pursuit of philanthropy in poetry (which he supposes Shelley to
7394,NOTE,advocate) is wrong. But this is another proof how much he had been
7395,NOTE,influenced by Shelley's poem; and it is perhaps not too rash to
7396,NOTE,conjecture that his consciousness of this influence was one reason why
7397,NOTE,"he had earlier refused to visit Shelley, in order that he might 'have"
7398,NOTE,his own unfettered scope.'[36]
7399,NOTE,
7400,NOTE,"If it seems to anyone that these conclusions are derogatory to Keats,"
7401,NOTE,"either as a man or a poet, I can only say that I differ from him"
7402,NOTE,entirely. But I will add that there seems to me some reason to
7403,NOTE,conjecture that Shelley had read the _Ode to a Nightingale_ before he
7404,NOTE,wrote the stanzas _To a Skylark_.

7580,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"V._, and nowhere else. But not very long after these plays were"
7581,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"composed, Shakespeare wrote, and he afterwards revised, the very"
7582,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],entertaining piece called _The Merry Wives of Windsor_. Perhaps his
7583,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"company wanted a new play on a sudden; or perhaps, as one would rather"
7584,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"believe, the tradition may be true that Queen Elizabeth, delighted with"
7585,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the Falstaff scenes of _Henry IV._, expressed a wish to see the hero of"
7586,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"them again, and to see him in love. Now it was no more possible for"
7587,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Shakespeare to show his own Falstaff in love than to turn twice two
7588,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"into five. But he could write in haste--the tradition says, in a"
7589,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"fortnight--a comedy or farce differing from all his other plays in this,"
7590,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"that its scene is laid in English middle-class life, and that it is"
7591,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],prosaic almost to the end. And among the characters he could introduce a
7592,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"disreputable fat old knight with attendants, and could call them"
7593,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Falstaff, Bardolph, Pistol, and Nym. And he could represent this knight"
7594,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"assailing, for financial purposes, the virtue of two matrons, and in the"
7595,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"event baffled, duped, treated like dirty linen, beaten, burnt, pricked,"
7596,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"mocked, insulted, and, worst of all, repentant and didactic. It is"
7597,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],horrible. It is almost enough to convince one that Shakespeare himself
7598,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],could sanction the parody of Ophelia in the _Two Noble Kinsmen_. But it
7599,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],no more touches the real Falstaff than Ophelia is degraded by that
7600,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],parody. To picture the real Falstaff befooled like the Falstaff of the
7601,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"_Merry Wives_ is like imagining Iago the gull of Roderigo, or Becky"
7602,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Sharp the dupe of Amelia Osborne. Before he had been served the least of
7603,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"these tricks he would have had his brains taken out and buttered, and"
7604,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],have given them to a dog for a New Year's gift. I quote the words of the
7605,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"impostor, for after all Shakespeare made him and gave to him a few"
7606,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],sentences worthy of Falstaff himself. But they are only a few--one side
7607,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],of a sheet of notepaper would contain them. And yet critics have
7608,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],solemnly debated at what period in his life Sir John endured the gibes
7609,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"of Master Ford, and whether we should put this comedy between the two"
7610,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"parts of _Henry IV._, or between the second of them and _Henry V._ And"
7611,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the Falstaff of the general reader, it is to be feared, is an impossible"
7612,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"conglomerate of two distinct characters, while the Falstaff of the mere"
7613,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],play-goer is certainly much more like the impostor than the true man.
7614,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7615,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"The separation of these two has long ago been effected by criticism, and"
7616,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],is insisted on in almost all competent estimates of the character of
7617,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Falstaff. I do not propose to attempt a full account either of this
7618,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"character or of that of Prince Henry, but shall connect the remarks I"
7619,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],have to make on them with a question which does not appear to have been
7620,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],satisfactorily discussed--the question of the rejection of Falstaff by
7621,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the Prince on his accession to the throne. What do we feel, and what are"
7622,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"we meant to feel, as we witness this rejection? And what does our"
7623,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],feeling imply as to the characters of Falstaff and the new King?
7624,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7625,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7626,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],1.
7627,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7628,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Sir John, you remember, is in Gloucestershire, engaged in borrowing a"
7629,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"thousand pounds from Justice Shallow; and here Pistol, riding"
7630,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"helter-skelter from London, brings him the great news that the old King"
7631,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"is as dead as nail in door, and that Harry the Fifth is the man. Sir"
7632,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"John, in wild excitement, taking any man's horses, rushes to London; and"
7633,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"he carries Shallow with him, for he longs to reward all his friends. We"
7634,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"find him standing with his companions just outside Westminster Abbey, in"
7635,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],the crowd that is waiting for the King to come out after his coronation.
7636,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"He himself is stained with travel, and has had no time to spend any of"
7637,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],the thousand pounds in buying new liveries for his men. But what of
7638,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"that? This poor show only proves his earnestness of affection, his"
7639,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"devotion, how he could not deliberate or remember or have patience to"
7640,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"shift himself, but rode day and night, thought of nothing else but to"
7641,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"see Henry, and put all affairs else in oblivion, as if there were"
7642,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],nothing else to be done but to see him. And now he stands sweating with
7643,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"desire to see him, and repeating and repeating this one desire of his"
7644,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],heart--'to see him.' The moment comes. There is a shout within the Abbey
7645,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"like the roaring of the sea, and a clangour of trumpets, and the doors"
7646,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],open and the procession streams out.
7647,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7648,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"FAL. God save thy grace, King Hal! my royal Hal!"
7649,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7650,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"PIST. The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp of fame!"
7651,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7652,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"FAL. God save thee, my sweet boy!"
7653,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7654,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"KING. My Lord Chief Justice, speak to that vain man."
7655,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7656,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],CH. JUST. Have you your wits? Know you what 'tis you speak?
7657,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7658,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"FAL. My King! my Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!"
7659,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7660,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"KING. I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers."
7661,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!
7662,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,"
7663,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"So surfeit-swell'd, so old and so profane;"
7664,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],But being awaked I do despise my dream.
7665,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;"
7666,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape
7667,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],For thee thrice wider than for other men.
7668,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Reply not to me with a fool-born jest:
7669,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Presume not that I am the thing I was;
7670,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,"
7671,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],That I have turn'd away my former self;
7672,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],So will I those that kept me company.
7673,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"When thou dost hear I am as I have been,"
7674,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,"
7675,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],The tutor and the feeder of my riots:
7676,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,"
7677,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"As I have done the rest of my misleaders,"
7678,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Not to come near our person by ten mile.
7679,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"For competence of life I will allow you,"
7680,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],That lack of means enforce you not to evil:
7681,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,"
7682,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"We will, according to your strengths and qualities,"
7683,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,"
7684,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],To see perform'd the tenour of our word.
7685,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Set on.
7686,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7687,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"The procession passes out of sight, but Falstaff and his friends remain."
7688,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"He shows no resentment. He comforts himself, or tries to comfort"
7689,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"himself--first, with the thought that he has Shallow's thousand pounds,"
7690,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"and then, more seriously, I believe, with another thought. The King, he"
7691,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"sees, must look thus to the world; but he will be sent for in private"
7692,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"when night comes, and will yet make the fortunes of his friends. But"
7693,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"even as he speaks, the Chief Justice, accompanied by Prince John,"
7694,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"returns, and gives the order to his officers:"
7695,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7696,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet;"
7697,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Take all his company along with him.
7698,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7699,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Falstaff breaks out, 'My lord, my lord,' but he is cut short and hurried"
7700,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],away; and after a few words between the Prince and the Chief Justice the
7701,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"scene closes, and with it the drama."
7702,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7703,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],What are our feelings during this scene? They will depend on our
7704,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],feelings about Falstaff. If we have not keenly enjoyed the Falstaff
7705,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"scenes of the two plays, if we regard Sir John chiefly as an old"
7706,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"reprobate, not only a sensualist, a liar, and a coward, but a cruel and"
7707,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"dangerous ruffian, I suppose we enjoy his discomfiture and consider that"
7708,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],the King has behaved magnificently. But if we _have_ keenly enjoyed the
7709,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Falstaff scenes, if we have enjoyed them as Shakespeare surely meant"
7710,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"them to be enjoyed, and if, accordingly, Falstaff is not to us solely or"
7711,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"even chiefly a reprobate and ruffian, we feel, I think, during the"
7712,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"King's speech, a good deal of pain and some resentment; and when,"
7713,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"without any further offence on Sir John's part, the Chief Justice"
7714,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"returns and sends him to prison, we stare in astonishment. These, I"
7715,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"believe, are, in greater or less degree, the feelings of most of those"
7716,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],who really enjoy the Falstaff scenes (as many readers do not). Nor are
7717,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"these feelings diminished when we remember the end of the whole story,"
7718,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"as we find it in _Henry V._, where we learn that Falstaff quickly died,"
7719,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"and, according to the testimony of persons not very sentimental, died of"
7720,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],a broken heart.[2] Suppose this merely to mean that he sank under the
7721,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"shame of his public disgrace, and it is pitiful enough: but the words of"
7722,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Mrs. Quickly, 'The king has killed his heart'; of Nym, 'The king hath"
7723,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"run bad humours on the knight; that's the even of it'; of Pistol,"
7724,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7725,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Nym, thou hast spoke the right,"
7726,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"His heart is fracted and corroborate,"
7727,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7728,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],assuredly point to something more than wounded pride; they point to
7729,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"wounded affection, and remind us of Falstaff's own answer to Prince"
7730,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Hal's question, 'Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?' 'A thousand"
7731,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"pound, Hal? a million: thy love is worth a million: thou owest me thy"
7732,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],love.'
7733,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7734,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Now why did Shakespeare end his drama with a scene which, though"
7735,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"undoubtedly striking, leaves an impression so unpleasant? I will venture"
7736,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],to put aside without discussion the idea that he meant us throughout the
7737,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"two plays to regard Falstaff with disgust or indignation, so that we"
7738,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],naturally feel nothing but pleasure at his fall; for this idea implies
7739,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],that kind of inability to understand Shakespeare with which it is idle
7740,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],to argue. And there is another and a much more ingenious suggestion
7741,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"which must equally be rejected as impossible. According to it, Falstaff,"
7742,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"having listened to the King's speech, did not seriously hope to be sent"
7743,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"for by him in private; he fully realised the situation at once, and was"
7744,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],only making game of Shallow; and in his immediate turn upon Shallow when
7745,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the King goes out, 'Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound,' we are"
7746,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"meant to see his humorous superiority to any rebuff, so that we end the"
7747,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"play with the delightful feeling that, while Henry has done the right"
7748,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"thing, Falstaff, in his outward overthrow, has still proved himself"
7749,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],inwardly invincible. This suggestion comes from a critic who understands
7750,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Falstaff, and in the suggestion itself shows that he understands him.[3]"
7751,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"But it provides no solution, because it wholly ignores, and could not"
7752,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"account for, that which follows the short conversation with Shallow."
7753,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Falstaff's dismissal to the Fleet, and his subsequent death, prove"
7754,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],beyond doubt that his rejection was meant by Shakespeare to be taken as
7755,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],a catastrophe which not even his humour could enable him to surmount.
7756,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7757,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Moreover, these interpretations, even if otherwise admissible, would"
7758,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],still leave our problem only partly solved. For what troubles us is not
7759,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"only the disappointment of Falstaff, it is the conduct of Henry. It was"
7760,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],inevitable that on his accession he should separate himself from Sir
7761,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"John, and we wish nothing else. It is satisfactory that Sir John should"
7762,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"have a competence, with the hope of promotion in the highly improbable"
7763,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],case of his reforming himself. And if Henry could not trust himself
7764,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"within ten miles of so fascinating a companion, by all means let him be"
7765,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],banished that distance: we do not complain. These arrangements would not
7766,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],have prevented a satisfactory ending: the King could have communicated
7767,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"his decision, and Falstaff could have accepted it, in a private"
7768,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],interview rich in humour and merely touched with pathos. But Shakespeare
7769,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],has so contrived matters that Henry could not send a private warning to
7770,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Falstaff even if he wished to, and in their public meeting Falstaff is"
7771,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],made to behave in so infatuated and outrageous a manner that great
7772,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],sternness on the King's part was unavoidable. And the curious thing is
7773,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],that Shakespeare did not stop here. If this had been all we should have
7774,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"felt pain for Falstaff, but not, perhaps, resentment against Henry. But"
7775,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"two things we do resent. Why, when this painful incident seems to be"
7776,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"over, should the Chief Justice return and send Falstaff to prison? Can"
7777,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],this possibly be meant for an act of private vengeance on the part of
7778,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the Chief Justice, unknown to the King? No; for in that case Shakespeare"
7779,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],would have shown at once that the King disapproved and cancelled it. It
7780,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],must have been the King's own act. This is one thing we resent; the
7781,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],other is the King's sermon. He had a right to turn away his former
7782,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"self, and his old companions with it, but he had no right to talk all of"
7783,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],a sudden like a clergyman; and surely it was both ungenerous and
7784,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"insincere to speak of them as his 'misleaders,' as though in the days of"
7785,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Eastcheap and Gadshill he had been a weak and silly lad. We have seen
7786,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"his former self, and we know that it was nothing of the kind. He had"
7787,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"shown himself, for all his follies, a very strong and independent young"
7788,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"man, deliberately amusing himself among men over whom he had just as"
7789,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"much ascendency as he chose to exert. Nay, he amused himself not only"
7790,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"among them, but at their expense. In his first soliloquy--and first"
7791,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],soliloquies are usually significant--he declares that he associates with
7792,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"them in order that, when at some future time he shows his true"
7793,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"character, he may be the more wondered at for his previous aberrations."
7794,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],You may think he deceives himself here; you may believe that he
7795,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],frequented Sir John's company out of delight in it and not merely with
7796,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],this cold-blooded design; but at any rate he _thought_ the design was
7797,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"his one motive. And, that being so, two results follow. He ought in"
7798,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],honour long ago to have given Sir John clearly to understand that they
7799,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"must say good-bye on the day of his accession. And, having neglected to"
7800,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"do this, he ought not to have lectured him as his misleader. It was not"
7801,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"only ungenerous, it was dishonest. It looks disagreeably like an attempt"
7802,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],to buy the praise of the respectable at the cost of honour and truth.
7803,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],And it succeeded. Henry _always_ succeeded.
7804,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7805,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"You will see what I am suggesting, for the moment, as a solution of our"
7806,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],problem. I am suggesting that our fault lies not in our resentment at
7807,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Henry's conduct, but in our surprise at it; that if we had read his"
7808,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"character truly in the light that Shakespeare gave us, we should have"
7809,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],been prepared for a display both of hardness and of policy at this point
7810,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"in his career, And although this suggestion does not suffice to solve"
7811,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the problem before us, I am convinced that in itself it is true. Nor is"
7812,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],it rendered at all improbable by the fact that Shakespeare has made
7813,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Henry, on the whole, a fine and very attractive character, and that here"
7814,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],he makes no one express any disapprobation of the treatment of Falstaff.
7815,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],For in similar cases Shakespeare is constantly misunderstood. His
7816,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],readers expect him to mark in some distinct way his approval or
7817,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],disapproval of that which he represents; and hence where _they_
7818,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"disapprove and _he_ says nothing, they fancy that he does _not_"
7819,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"disapprove, and they blame his indifference, like Dr. Johnson, or at the"
7820,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],least are puzzled. But the truth is that he shows the fact and leaves
7821,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the judgment to them. And again, when he makes us like a character we"
7822,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],expect the character to have no faults that are not expressly pointed
7823,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"out, and when other faults appear we either ignore them or try to"
7824,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],explain them away. This is one of our methods of conventionalising
7825,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Shakespeare. We want the world's population to be neatly divided into
7826,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"sheep and goats, and we want an angel by us to say, 'Look, that is a"
7827,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"goat and this is a sheep,' and we try to turn Shakespeare into this"
7828,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],angel. His impartiality makes us uncomfortable: we cannot bear to see
7829,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"him, like the sun, lighting up everything and judging nothing. And this"
7830,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"is perhaps especially the case in his historical plays, where we are"
7831,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],always trying to turn him into a partisan. He shows us that Richard II.
7832,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"was unworthy to be king, and we at once conclude that he thought"
7833,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Bolingbroke's usurpation justified; whereas he shows merely, what under"
7834,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the conditions was bound to exist, an inextricable tangle of right and"
7835,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"unright. Or, Bolingbroke being evidently wronged, we suppose"
7836,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Bolingbroke's statements to be true, and are quite surprised when, after"
7837,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"attaining his end through them, he mentions casually on his death-bed"
7838,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],that they were lies. Shakespeare makes us admire Hotspur heartily; and
7839,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"accordingly, when we see Hotspur discussing with others how large his"
7840,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"particular slice of his mother-country is to be, we either fail to"
7841,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"recognise the monstrosity of the proceeding, or, recognising it, we"
7842,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],complain that Shakespeare is inconsistent. Prince John breaks a
7843,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],tottering rebellion by practising a detestable fraud on the rebels. We
7844,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"are against the rebels, and have heard high praise of Prince John, but"
7845,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],we cannot help seeing that his fraud is detestable; so we say
7846,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"indignantly to Shakespeare, 'Why, you told us he was a sheep'; whereas,"
7847,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"in fact, if we had used our eyes we should have known beforehand that he"
7848,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"was the brave, determined, loyal, cold-blooded, pitiless, unscrupulous"
7849,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],son of a usurper whose throne was in danger.
7850,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7851,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"To come, then, to Henry. Both as prince and as king he is deservedly a"
7852,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"favourite, and particularly so with English readers, being, as he is,"
7853,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],perhaps the most distinctively English of all Shakespeare's men. In
7854,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],_Henry V._ he is treated as a national hero. In this play he has lost
7855,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],much of the wit which in him seems to have depended on contact with
7856,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Falstaff, but he has also laid aside the most serious faults of his"
7857,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"youth. He inspires in a high degree fear, enthusiasm, and affection;"
7858,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],thanks to his beautiful modesty he has the charm which is lacking to
7859,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"another mighty warrior, Coriolanus; his youthful escapades have given"
7860,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"him an understanding of simple folk, and sympathy with them; he is the"
7861,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"author of the saying, 'There is some soul of goodness in things evil';"
7862,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],and he is much more obviously religious than most of Shakespeare's
7863,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"heroes. Having these and other fine qualities, and being without certain"
7864,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"dangerous tendencies which mark the tragic heroes, he is, perhaps, the"
7865,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"most _efficient_ character drawn by Shakespeare, unless Ulysses, in"
7866,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"_Troilus and Cressida_, is his equal. And so he has been described as"
7867,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Shakespeare's ideal man of action; nay, it has even been declared that"
7868,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"here for once Shakespeare plainly disclosed his own ethical creed, and"
7869,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"showed us his ideal, not simply of a man of action, but of a man."
7870,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7871,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],But Henry is neither of these. The poet who drew Hamlet and Othello can
7872,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],never have thought that even the ideal man of action would lack that
7873,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],light upon the brow which at once transfigures them and marks their
7874,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"doom. It is as easy to believe that, because the lunatic, the lover, and"
7875,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the poet are not far apart, Shakespeare would have chosen never to have"
7876,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"loved and sung. Even poor Timon, the most inefficient of the tragic"
7877,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"heroes, has something in him that Henry never shows. Nor is it merely"
7878,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],that his nature is limited: if we follow Shakespeare and look closely at
7879,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Henry, we shall discover with the many fine traits a few less pleasing."
7880,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Henry IV. describes him as the noble image of his own youth; and, for"
7881,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"all his superiority to his father, he is still his father's son, the son"
7882,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"of the man whom Hotspur called a 'vile politician.' Henry's religion,"
7883,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"for example, is genuine, it is rooted in his modesty; but it is also"
7884,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],superstitious--an attempt to buy off supernatural vengeance for
7885,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Richard's blood; and it is also in part political, like his father's"
7886,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"projected crusade. Just as he went to war chiefly because, as his father"
7887,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"told him, it was the way to keep factious nobles quiet and unite the"
7888,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"nation, so when he adjures the Archbishop to satisfy him as to his right"
7889,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"to the French throne, he knows very well that the Archbishop _wants_ the"
7890,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"war, because it will defer and perhaps prevent what he considers the"
7891,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],spoliation of the Church. This same strain of policy is what Shakespeare
7892,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"marks in the first soliloquy in _Henry IV._, where the prince describes"
7893,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],his riotous life as a mere scheme to win him glory later. It implies
7894,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],that readiness to use other people as means to his own ends which is a
7895,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],conspicuous feature in his father; and it reminds us of his father's
7896,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],plan of keeping himself out of the people's sight while Richard was
7897,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],making himself cheap by his incessant public appearances. And if I am
7898,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],not mistaken there is a further likeness. Henry is kindly and pleasant
7899,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"to every one as Prince, to every one deserving as King; and he is so not"
7900,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],merely out of policy: but there is no sign in him of a strong affection
7901,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"for any one, such an affection as we recognise at a glance in Hamlet and"
7902,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Horatio, Brutus and Cassius, and many more. We do not find this in"
7903,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"_Henry V._, not even in the noble address to Lord Scroop, and in _Henry"
7904,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"IV._ we find, I think, a liking for Falstaff and Poins, but no more:"
7905,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"there is no more than a liking, for instance, in his soliloquy over the"
7906,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"supposed corpse of his fat friend, and he never speaks of Falstaff to"
7907,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Poins with any affection. The truth is, that the members of the family"
7908,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"of Henry IV. have love for one another, but they cannot spare love for"
7909,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"any one outside their family, which stands firmly united, defending its"
7910,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],royal position against attack and instinctively isolating itself from
7911,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],outside influence.
7912,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7913,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Thus I would suggest that Henry's conduct in his rejection of Falstaff
7914,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],is in perfect keeping with his character on its unpleasant side as well
7915,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"as on its finer; and that, so far as Henry is concerned, we ought not to"
7916,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],feel surprise at it. And on this view we may even explain the strange
7917,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],incident of the Chief Justice being sent back to order Falstaff to
7918,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],prison (for there is no sign of any such uncertainty in the text as
7919,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],might suggest an interpolation by the players). Remembering his father's
7920,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"words about Henry, 'Being incensed, he's flint,' and remembering in"
7921,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],_Henry V._ his ruthlessness about killing the prisoners when he is
7922,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"incensed, we may imagine that, after he had left Falstaff and was no"
7923,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"longer influenced by the face of his old companion, he gave way to anger"
7924,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],at the indecent familiarity which had provoked a compromising scene on
7925,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],the most ceremonial of occasions and in the presence alike of court and
7926,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"crowd, and that he sent the Chief Justice back to take vengeance. And"
7927,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],this is consistent with the fact that in the next play we find Falstaff
7928,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"shortly afterwards not only freed from prison, but unmolested in his old"
7929,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"haunt in Eastcheap, well within ten miles of Henry's person. His anger"
7930,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"had soon passed, and he knew that the requisite effect had been produced"
7931,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],both on Falstaff and on the world.
7932,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7933,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"But all this, however true, will not solve our problem. It seems, on the"
7934,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"contrary, to increase its difficulty. For the natural conclusion is that"
7935,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Shakespeare _intended_ us to feel resentment against Henry. And yet that
7936,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"cannot be, for it implies that he meant the play to end disagreeably;"
7937,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],and no one who understands Shakespeare at all will consider that
7938,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],supposition for a moment credible. No; he must have meant the play to
7939,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"end pleasantly, although he made Henry's action consistent. And hence it"
7940,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],follows that he must have intended our sympathy with Falstaff to be so
7941,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],far weakened when the rejection-scene arrives that his discomfiture
7942,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],should be satisfactory to us; that we should enjoy this sudden reverse
7943,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],of enormous hopes (a thing always ludicrous if sympathy is absent); that
7944,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],we should approve the moral judgment that falls on him; and so should
7945,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],pass lightly over that disclosure of unpleasant traits in the King's
7946,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],character which Shakespeare was too true an artist to suppress. Thus our
7947,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"pain and resentment, if we feel them, are wrong, in the sense that they"
7948,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],do not answer to the dramatist's intention. But it does not follow that
7949,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"they are wrong in a further sense. They may be right, because the"
7950,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"dramatist has missed what he aimed at. And this, though the dramatist"
7951,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"was Shakespeare, is what I would suggest. In the Falstaff scenes he"
7952,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"overshot his mark. He created so extraordinary a being, and fixed him so"
7953,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"firmly on his intellectual throne, that when he sought to dethrone him"
7954,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],he could not. The moment comes when we are to look at Falstaff in a
7955,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"serious light, and the comic hero is to figure as a baffled schemer; but"
7956,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"we cannot make the required change, either in our attitude or in our"
7957,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],sympathies. We wish Henry a glorious reign and much joy of his crew of
7958,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"hypocritical politicians, lay and clerical; but our hearts go with"
7959,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Falstaff to the Fleet, or, if necessary, to Arthur's bosom or"
7960,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],wheresomever he is.[4]
7961,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7962,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],In the remainder of the lecture I will try to make this view clear. And
7963,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],to that end we must go back to the Falstaff of the body of the two
7964,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"plays, the immortal Falstaff, a character almost purely humorous, and"
7965,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"therefore no subject for moral judgments. I can but draw an outline, and"
7966,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],in describing one aspect of this character must be content to hold
7967,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],another in reserve.
7968,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7969,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7970,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],2.
7971,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7972,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Up to a certain point Falstaff is ludicrous in the same way as many
7973,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"other figures, his distinction lying, so far, chiefly in the mere"
7974,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],abundance of ludicrous traits. _Why_ we should laugh at a man with a
7975,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],huge belly and corresponding appetites; at the inconveniences he suffers
7976,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"on a hot day, or in playing the footpad, or when he falls down and there"
7977,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],are no levers at hand to lift him up again; at the incongruity of his
7978,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"unwieldy bulk and the nimbleness of his spirit, the infirmities of his"
7979,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],age and his youthful lightness of heart; at the enormity of his lies and
7980,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"wiles, and the suddenness of their exposure and frustration; at the"
7981,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"contrast between his reputation and his real character, seen most"
7982,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"absurdly when, at the mere mention of his name, a redoubted rebel"
7983,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"surrenders to him--_why_, I say, we should laugh at these and many such"
7984,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"things, this is no place to inquire; but unquestionably we do. Here we"
7985,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],have them poured out in endless profusion and with that air of careless
7986,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],ease which is so fascinating in Shakespeare; and with the enjoyment of
7987,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],them I believe many readers stop. But while they are quite essential to
7988,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the character, there is in it much more. For these things by themselves"
7989,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"do not explain why, beside laughing at Falstaff, we are made happy by"
7990,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"him and laugh _with_ him. He is not, like Parolles, a mere _object_ of"
7991,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],mirth.
7992,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
7993,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],The main reason why he makes us so happy and puts us so entirely at our
7994,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],ease is that he himself is happy and entirely at his ease. 'Happy' is
7995,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"too weak a word; he is in bliss, and we share his glory. Enjoyment--no"
7996,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"fitful pleasure crossing a dull life, nor any vacant convulsive"
7997,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],mirth--but a rich deep-toned chuckling enjoyment circulates continually
7998,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"through all his being. If you ask _what_ he enjoys, no doubt the answer"
7999,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"is, in the first place, eating and drinking, taking his ease at his inn,"
8000,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"and the company of other merry souls. Compared with these things, what"
8001,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"we count the graver interests of life are nothing to him. But then,"
8002,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"while we are under his spell, it is impossible to consider these graver"
8003,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"interests; gravity is to us, as to him, inferior to gravy; and what he"
8004,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],does enjoy he enjoys with such a luscious and good-humoured zest that we
8005,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"sympathise and he makes us happy. And if any one objected, we should"
8006,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"answer with Sir Toby Belch, 'Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous,"
8007,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],there shall be no more cakes and ale?'
8008,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
8009,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"But this, again, is far from all. Falstaff's ease and enjoyment are not"
8010,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],simply those of the happy man of appetite;[5] they are those of the
8011,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"humorist, and the humorist of genius. Instead of being comic to you and"
8012,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"serious to himself, he is more ludicrous to himself than to you; and he"
8013,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"makes himself out more ludicrous than he is, in order that he and"
8014,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],others may laugh. Prince Hal never made such sport of Falstaff's person
8015,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],as he himself did. It is _he_ who says that his skin hangs about him
8016,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"like an old lady's loose gown, and that he walks before his page like a"
8017,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],sow that hath o'erwhelmed all her litter but one. And he jests at
8018,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],himself when he is alone just as much as when others are by. It is the
8019,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],same with his appetites. The direct enjoyment they bring him is scarcely
8020,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],so great as the enjoyment of laughing at this enjoyment; and for all his
8021,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],addiction to sack you never see him for an instant with a brain dulled
8022,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"by it, or a temper turned solemn, silly, quarrelsome, or pious. The"
8023,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"virtue it instils into him, of filling his brain with nimble, fiery, and"
8024,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"delectable shapes--this, and his humorous attitude towards it, free him,"
8025,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"in a manner, from slavery to it; and it is this freedom, and no secret"
8026,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],longing for better things (those who attribute such a longing to him are
8027,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"far astray), that makes his enjoyment contagious and prevents our"
8028,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],sympathy with it from being disturbed.
8029,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
8030,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],The bliss of freedom gained in humour is the essence of Falstaff. His
8031,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],humour is not directed only or chiefly against obvious absurdities; he
8032,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"is the enemy of everything that would interfere with his ease, and"
8033,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"therefore of anything serious, and especially of everything respectable"
8034,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"and moral. For these things impose limits and obligations, and make us"
8035,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the subjects of old father antic the law, and the categorical"
8036,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"imperative, and our station and its duties, and conscience, and"
8037,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"reputation, and other people's opinions, and all sorts of nuisances. I"
8038,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],say he is therefore their enemy; but I do him wrong; to say that he is
8039,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],their enemy implies that he regards them as serious and recognises their
8040,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"power, when in truth he refuses to recognise them at all. They are to"
8041,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],him absurd; and to reduce a thing _ad absurdum_ is to reduce it to
8042,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],nothing and to walk about free and rejoicing. This is what Falstaff
8043,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"does with all the would-be serious things of life, sometimes only by his"
8044,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"words, sometimes by his actions too. He will make truth appear absurd by"
8045,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"solemn statements, which he utters with perfect gravity and which he"
8046,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"expects nobody to believe; and honour, by demonstrating that it cannot"
8047,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"set a leg, and that neither the living nor the dead can possess it; and"
8048,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"law, by evading all the attacks of its highest representative and almost"
8049,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"forcing him to laugh at his own defeat; and patriotism, by filling his"
8050,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],pockets with the bribes offered by competent soldiers who want to escape
8051,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"service, while he takes in their stead the halt and maimed and the"
8052,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"gaol-birds; and duty, by showing how he labours in his vocation--of"
8053,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"thieving; and courage, alike by mocking at his own capture of Colvile"
8054,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"and gravely claiming to have killed Hotspur; and war, by offering the"
8055,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Prince his bottle of sack when he is asked for a sword; and religion, by"
8056,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],amusing himself with remorse at odd times when he has nothing else to
8057,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"do; and the fear of death, by maintaining perfectly untouched, in the"
8058,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"face of imminent peril and even while he _feels_ the fear of death, the"
8059,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],very same power of dissolving it in persiflage that he shows when he
8060,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],sits at ease in his inn. These are the wonderful achievements which he
8061,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"performs, not with the sourness of a cynic, but with the gaiety of a"
8062,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"boy. And, therefore, we praise him, we laud him, for he offends none but"
8063,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the virtuous, and denies that life is real or life is earnest, and"
8064,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"delivers us from the oppression of such nightmares, and lifts us into"
8065,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],the atmosphere of perfect freedom.
8066,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
8067,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"No one in the play understands Falstaff fully, any more than Hamlet was"
8068,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],understood by the persons round him. They are both men of genius. Mrs.
8069,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Quickly and Bardolph are his slaves, but they know not why. 'Well, fare"
8070,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"thee well,' says the hostess whom he has pillaged and forgiven; 'I have"
8071,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"known thee these twenty-nine years, come peas-cod time, but an honester"
8072,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"and truer-hearted man--well, fare thee well.' Poins and the Prince"
8073,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],delight in him; they get him into corners for the pleasure of seeing him
8074,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],escape in ways they cannot imagine; but they often take him much too
8075,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"seriously. Poins, for instance, rarely sees, the Prince does not always"
8076,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"see, and moralising critics never see, that when Falstaff speaks ill of"
8077,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"a companion behind his back, or writes to the Prince that Poins spreads"
8078,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"it abroad that the Prince is to marry his sister, he knows quite well"
8079,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"that what he says will be repeated, or rather, perhaps, is absolutely"
8080,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"indifferent whether it be repeated or not, being certain that it can"
8081,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"only give him an opportunity for humour. It is the same with his lying,"
8082,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"and almost the same with his cowardice, the two main vices laid to his"
8083,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],charge even by sympathisers. Falstaff is neither a liar nor a coward in
8084,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the usual sense, like the typical cowardly boaster of comedy. He tells"
8085,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"his lies either for their own humour, or on purpose to get himself into"
8086,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"a difficulty. He rarely expects to be believed, perhaps never. He"
8087,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],abandons a statement or contradicts it the moment it is made. There is
8088,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],scarcely more intent in his lying than in the humorous exaggerations
8089,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],which he pours out in soliloquy just as much as when others are by.
8090,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Poins and the Prince understand this in part. You see them waiting
8091,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"eagerly to convict him, not that they may really put him to shame, but"
8092,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],in order to enjoy the greater lie that will swallow up the less. But
8093,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],their sense of humour lags behind his. Even the Prince seems to accept
8094,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],as half-serious that remorse of his which passes so suddenly into glee
8095,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"at the idea of taking a purse, and his request to his friend to bestride"
8096,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],him if he should see him down in the battle. Bestride Falstaff! 'Hence!
8097,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Wilt thou lift up Olympus?'
8098,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
8099,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Again, the attack of the Prince and Poins on Falstaff and the other"
8100,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"thieves on Gadshill is contrived, we know, with a view to the"
8101,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"incomprehensible lies it will induce him to tell. But when, more than"
8102,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"rising to the occasion, he turns two men in buckram into four, and then"
8103,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"seven, and then nine, and then eleven, almost in a breath, I believe"
8104,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"they partly misunderstand his intention, and too many of his critics"
8105,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],misunderstand it altogether. Shakespeare was not writing a mere farce.
8106,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],It is preposterous to suppose that a man of Falstaff's intelligence
8107,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"would utter these gross, palpable, open lies with the serious intention"
8108,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"to deceive, or forget that, if it was too dark for him to see his own"
8109,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"hand, he could hardly see that the three misbegotten knaves were wearing"
8110,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Kendal green. No doubt, if he _had_ been believed, he would have been"
8111,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"hugely tickled at it, but he no more expected to be believed than when"
8112,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],he claimed to have killed Hotspur. Yet he is supposed to be serious even
8113,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],then. Such interpretations would destroy the poet's whole conception;
8114,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],and of those who adopt them one might ask this out of some twenty
8115,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"similar questions:--When Falstaff, in the men in buckram scene, begins"
8116,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"by calling twice at short intervals for sack, and then a little later"
8117,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"calls for more and says, 'I am a rogue if I drunk to-day,' and the"
8118,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Prince answers, 'O villain, thy lips are scarce wiped since thou"
8119,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"drunk'st last,' do they think that _that_ lie was meant to deceive? And"
8120,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"if not, why do they take it for granted that the others were? I suppose"
8121,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"they consider that Falstaff was in earnest when, wanting to get"
8122,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],twenty-two yards of satin on trust from Master Dombledon the
8123,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"silk-mercer, he offered Bardolph as security; or when he said to the"
8124,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Chief Justice about Mrs. Quickly, who accused him of breaking his"
8125,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"promise to marry her, 'My lord, this is a poor mad soul, and she says up"
8126,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],and down the town that her eldest son is like you'; or when he explained
8127,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"his enormous bulk by exclaiming, 'A plague of sighing and grief! It"
8128,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],blows a man up like a bladder'; or when he accounted for his voice
8129,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],being cracked by declaring that he had 'lost it with singing of
8130,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],anthems'; or even when he sold his soul on Good-Friday to the devil for
8131,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],a cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg. Falstaff's lies about Hotspur
8132,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],and the men in buckram do not essentially differ from these statements.
8133,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],There is nothing serious in any of them except the refusal to take
8134,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],anything seriously.
8135,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
8136,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"This is also the explanation of Falstaff's cowardice, a subject on which"
8137,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"I should say nothing if Maurice Morgann's essay,[6] now more than a"
8138,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"century old, were better known. That Falstaff sometimes behaves in what"
8139,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],we should generally call a cowardly way is certain; but that does not
8140,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],show that he was a coward; and if the word means a person who feels
8141,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"painful fear in the presence of danger, and yields to that fear in spite"
8142,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"of his better feelings and convictions, then assuredly Falstaff was no"
8143,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"coward. The stock bully and boaster of comedy is one, but not Falstaff."
8144,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"It is perfectly clear in the first place that, though he had"
8145,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],unfortunately a reputation for stabbing and caring not what mischief he
8146,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"did if his weapon were out, he had not a reputation for cowardice."
8147,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Shallow remembered him five-and-fifty years ago breaking Scogan's head
8148,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],at the court-gate when he was a crack not thus high; and Shallow knew
8149,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],him later a good back-swordsman. Then we lose sight of him till about
8150,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"twenty years after, when his association with Bardolph began; and that"
8151,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],association implies that by the time he was thirty-five or forty he had
8152,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"sunk into the mode of life we witness in the plays. Yet, even as we see"
8153,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"him there, he remains a person of consideration in the army. Twelve"
8154,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],captains hurry about London searching for him. He is present at the
8155,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Council of War in the King's tent at Shrewsbury, where the only other"
8156,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"persons are the King, the two princes, a nobleman and Sir Walter Blunt."
8157,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],The messenger who brings the false report of the battle to
8158,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Northumberland mentions, as one of the important incidents, the death of"
8159,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Sir John Falstaff. Colvile, expressly described as a famous rebel,"
8160,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],surrenders to him as soon as he hears his name. And if his own wish that
8161,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"his name were not so terrible to the enemy, and his own boast of his"
8162,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"European reputation, are not evidence of the first rank, they must not"
8163,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],be entirely ignored in presence of these other facts. What do these
8164,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"facts mean? Does Shakespeare put them all in with no purpose at all, or"
8165,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],in defiance of his own intentions? It is not credible.
8166,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
8167,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"And when, in the second place, we look at Falstaff's actions, what do we"
8168,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"find? He boldly confronted Colvile, he was quite ready to fight with"
8169,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"him, however pleased that Colvile, like a kind fellow, gave himself"
8170,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"away. When he saw Henry and Hotspur fighting, Falstaff, instead of"
8171,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"making off in a panic, stayed to take his chance if Hotspur should be"
8172,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],the victor. He _led_ his hundred and fifty ragamuffins where they were
8173,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"peppered, he did not _send_ them. To draw upon Pistol and force him"
8174,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"downstairs and wound him in the shoulder was no great feat, perhaps, but"
8175,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],the stock coward would have shrunk from it. When the Sheriff came to the
8176,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"inn to arrest him for an offence whose penalty was death, Falstaff, who"
8177,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"was hidden behind the arras, did not stand there quaking for fear, he"
8178,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],immediately fell asleep and snored. When he stood in the battle
8179,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],reflecting on what would happen if the weight of his paunch should be
8180,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"increased by that of a bullet, he cannot have been in a tremor of craven"
8181,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"fear. He _never_ shows such fear; and surely the man who, in danger of"
8182,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"his life, and with no one by to hear him, meditates thus: 'I like not"
8183,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath. Give me life: which if I can
8184,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"save, so; if not, honour comes unlooked-for, and there's an end,' is not"
8185,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],what we commonly call a coward.
8186,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
8187,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"'Well,' it will be answered, 'but he ran away on Gadshill; and when"
8188,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Douglas attacked him he fell down and shammed dead.' Yes, I am thankful"
8189,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"to say, he did. For of course he did not want to be dead. He wanted to"
8190,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],live and be merry. And as he had reduced the idea of honour _ad
8191,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"absurdum_, had scarcely any self-respect, and only a respect for"
8192,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"reputation as a means of life, naturally he avoided death when he could"
8193,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"do so without a ruinous loss of reputation, and (observe) with the"
8194,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],satisfaction of playing a colossal practical joke. For _that_ after all
8195,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],was his first object. If his one thought had been to avoid death he
8196,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"would not have faced Douglas at all, but would have run away as fast as"
8197,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],his legs could carry him; and unless Douglas had been one of those
8198,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"exceptional Scotchmen who have no sense of humour, he would never have"
8199,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],thought of pursuing so ridiculous an object as Falstaff running. So
8200,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"that, as Mr. Swinburne remarks, Poins is right when he thus"
8201,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"distinguishes Falstaff from his companions in robbery: 'For two of them,"
8202,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the
8203,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll forswear arms.' And"
8204,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the event justifies this distinction. For it is exactly thus that,"
8205,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"according to the original stage-direction, Falstaff behaves when Henry"
8206,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],and Poins attack him and the others. The rest run away at once;
8207,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Falstaff, here as afterwards with Douglas, fights for a blow or two,"
8208,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"but, finding himself deserted and outmatched, runs away also. Of course."
8209,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],He saw no reason to stay. _Any_ man who had risen superior to all
8210,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],serious motives would have run away. But it does not follow that he
8211,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"would run from mere fear, or be, in the ordinary sense, a coward.[7]"
8212,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
8213,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
8214,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],3.
8215,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
8216,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"The main source, then, of our sympathetic delight in Falstaff is his"
8217,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"humorous superiority to everything serious, and the freedom of soul"
8218,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"enjoyed in it. But, of course, this is not the whole of his character."
8219,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Shakespeare knew well enough that perfect freedom is not to be gained in
8220,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],this manner; we are ourselves aware of it even while we are sympathising
8221,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],with Falstaff; and as soon as we regard him seriously it becomes
8222,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],obvious. His freedom is limited in two main ways. For one thing he
8223,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],cannot rid himself entirely of respect for all that he professes to
8224,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"ridicule. He shows a certain pride in his rank: unlike the Prince, he is"
8225,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"haughty to the drawers, who call him a proud Jack. He is not really"
8226,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],quite indifferent to reputation. When the Chief Justice bids him pay his
8227,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"debt to Mrs. Quickly for his reputation's sake, I think he feels a"
8228,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"twinge, though to be sure he proceeds to pay her by borrowing from her."
8229,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"He is also stung by any thoroughly serious imputation on his courage,"
8230,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],and winces at the recollection of his running away on Gadshill; he knows
8231,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"that his behaviour there certainly looked cowardly, and perhaps he"
8232,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"remembers that he would not have behaved so once. It is, further, very"
8233,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"significant that, for all his dissolute talk, he has never yet allowed"
8234,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],the Prince and Poins to _see_ him as they saw him afterwards with Doll
8235,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Tearsheet; not, of course, that he has any moral shame in the matter,"
8236,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"but he knows that in such a situation he, in his old age, must appear"
8237,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"contemptible--not a humorist but a mere object of mirth. And, finally,"
8238,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"he has affection in him--affection, I think, for Poins and Bardolph, and"
8239,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],certainly for the Prince; and that is a thing which he cannot jest out
8240,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"of existence. Hence, as the effect of his rejection shows, he is not"
8241,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"really invulnerable. And then, in the second place, since he is in the"
8242,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"flesh, his godlike freedom has consequences and conditions;"
8243,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"consequences, for there is something painfully wrong with his great toe;"
8244,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"conditions, for he cannot eat and drink for ever without money, and his"
8245,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"purse suffers from consumption, a disease for which he can find no"
8246,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"remedy.[8] As the Chief Justice tells him, his means are very slender"
8247,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"and his waste great; and his answer, 'I would it were otherwise; I would"
8248,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"my means were greater and my waist slenderer,' though worth much money,"
8249,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],brings none in. And so he is driven to evil deeds; not only to cheating
8250,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"his tailor like a gentleman, but to fleecing Justice Shallow, and to"
8251,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"highway robbery, and to cruel depredations on the poor woman whose"
8252,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],affection he has secured. All this is perfectly consistent with the
8253,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"other side of his character, but by itself it makes an ugly picture."
8254,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
8255,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Yes, it makes an ugly picture when you look at it seriously. But then,"
8256,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"surely, so long as the humorous atmosphere is preserved and the humorous"
8257,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"attitude maintained, you do not look at it so. You no more regard"
8258,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Falstaff's misdeeds morally than you do the much more atrocious misdeeds
8259,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"of Punch or Reynard the Fox. You do not exactly ignore them, but you"
8260,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"attend only to their comic aspect. This is the very spirit of comedy,"
8261,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"and certainly of Shakespeare's comic world, which is one of"
8262,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"make-believe, not merely as his tragic world is, but in a further"
8263,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"sense--a world in which gross improbabilities are accepted with a smile,"
8264,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"and many things are welcomed as merely laughable which, regarded"
8265,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"gravely, would excite anger and disgust. The intervention of a serious"
8266,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"spirit breaks up such a world, and would destroy our pleasure in"
8267,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Falstaff's company. Accordingly through the greater part of these dramas
8268,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Shakespeare carefully confines this spirit to the scenes of war and
8269,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"policy, and dismisses it entirely in the humorous parts. Hence, if"
8270,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"_Henry IV._ had been a comedy like _Twelfth Night_, I am sure that he"
8271,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],would no more have ended it with the painful disgrace of Falstaff than
8272,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],he ended _Twelfth Night_ by disgracing Sir Toby Belch.[9]
8273,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
8274,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"But _Henry IV._ was to be in the main a historical play, and its chief"
8275,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],hero Prince Henry. In the course of it his greater and finer qualities
8276,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"were to be gradually revealed, and it was to end with beautiful scenes"
8277,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"of reconciliation and affection between his father and him, and a final"
8278,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"emergence of the wild Prince as a just, wise, stern, and glorious King."
8279,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Hence, no doubt, it seemed to Shakespeare that Falstaff at last must be"
8280,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"disgraced, and must therefore appear no longer as the invincible"
8281,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"humorist, but as an object of ridicule and even of aversion. And"
8282,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"probably also his poet's insight showed him that Henry, as he conceived"
8283,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"him, _would_ behave harshly to Falstaff in order to impress the world,"
8284,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],especially when his mind had been wrought to a high pitch by the scene
8285,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],with his dying father and the impression of his own solemn consecration
8286,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],to great duties.
8287,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
8288,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],This conception was a natural and a fine one; and if the execution was
8289,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"not an entire success, it is yet full of interest. Shakespeare's purpose"
8290,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"being to work a gradual change in our feelings towards Falstaff, and to"
8291,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"tinge the humorous atmosphere more and more deeply with seriousness, we"
8292,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],see him carrying out this purpose in the Second Part of _Henry IV._ Here
8293,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"he separates the Prince from Falstaff as much as he can, thus"
8294,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"withdrawing him from Falstaff's influence, and weakening in our minds"
8295,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],the connection between the two. In the First Part we constantly see them
8296,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],together; in the Second (it is a remarkable fact) only once before the
8297,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"rejection. Further, in the scenes where Henry appears apart from"
8298,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"Falstaff, we watch him growing more and more grave, and awakening more"
8299,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"and more poetic interest; while Falstaff, though his humour scarcely"
8300,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"flags to the end, exhibits more and more of his seamy side. This is"
8301,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],nowhere turned to the full light in Part I.; but in Part II. we see him
8302,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"as the heartless destroyer of Mrs. Quickly, as a ruffian seriously"
8303,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],defying the Chief Justice because his position as an officer on service
8304,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"gives him power to do wrong, as the pike preparing to snap up the poor"
8305,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"old dace Shallow, and (this is the one scene where Henry and he meet) as"
8306,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"the worn-out lecher, not laughing at his servitude to the flesh but sunk"
8307,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"in it. Finally, immediately before the rejection, the world where he is"
8308,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],king is exposed in all its sordid criminality when we find Mrs. Quickly
8309,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"and Doll arrested for being concerned in the death of one man, if not"
8310,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"more, beaten to death by their bullies; and the dangerousness of"
8311,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Falstaff is emphasised in his last words as he hurries from Shallow's
8312,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"house to London, words at first touched with humour but at bottom only"
8313,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],too seriously meant: 'Let us take any man's horses; the laws of England
8314,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"are at my commandment. Happy are they which have been my friends, and"
8315,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],woe unto my Lord Chief Justice.' His dismissal to the Fleet by the Chief
8316,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Justice is the dramatic vengeance for that threat.
8317,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],
8318,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Yet all these excellent devices fail. They cause us momentary
8319,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],embarrassment at times when repellent traits in Falstaff's character are
8320,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],disclosed; but they fail to change our attitude of humour into one of
8321,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"seriousness, and our sympathy into repulsion. And they were bound to"
8322,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"fail, because Shakespeare shrank from adding to them the one device"
8323,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"which would have ensured success. If, as the Second Part of _Henry IV._"
8324,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"advanced, he had clouded over Falstaff's humour so heavily that the man"
8325,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"of genius turned into the Falstaff of the _Merry Wives_, we should have"
8326,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],witnessed his rejection without a pang. This Shakespeare was too much
8327,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],of an artist to do--though even in this way he did something--and
8328,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"without this device he could not succeed. As I said, in the creation of"
8329,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],Falstaff he overreached himself. He was caught up on the wind of his own
8330,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"genius, and carried so far that he could not descend to earth at the"
8331,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"selected spot. It is not a misfortune that happens to many authors, nor"
8332,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"is it one we can regret, for it costs us but a trifling inconvenience in"
8333,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"one scene, while we owe to it perhaps the greatest comic character in"
8334,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"literature. For it is in this character, and not in the judgment he"
8335,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"brings upon Falstaff's head, that Shakespeare asserts his supremacy. To"
8336,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"show that Falstaff's freedom of soul was in part illusory, and that the"
8337,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],realities of life refused to be conjured away by his humour--this was
8338,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"what we might expect from Shakespeare's unfailing sanity, but it was"
8339,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],surely no achievement beyond the power of lesser men. The achievement
8340,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"was Falstaff himself, and the conception of that freedom of soul, a"
8341,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"freedom illusory only in part, and attainable only by a mind which had"
8342,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],received from Shakespeare's own the inexplicable touch of infinity which
8343,THE REJECTION OF FALSTAFF[1],"he bestowed on Hamlet and Macbeth and Cleopatra, but denied to Henry the"

8357,NOTE,"Embassy for ratifying the peace with America, in 1783. He died at his"
8358,NOTE,"house in Knightsbridge, in the seventy-seventh year of his age, on the"
8359,NOTE,"28th March, 1802' (Preface to the edition of 1825). He was a remarkable"
8360,NOTE,"and original man, who seems to have written a good deal, but, beyond"
8361,NOTE,"this essay and some pamphlets on public affairs, all or nearly all"
8362,NOTE,"anonymous, he published nothing, and at his death he left orders that"
8363,NOTE,all his papers should be destroyed. The _Essay on the Dramatic Character
8364,NOTE,of Sir John Falstaff_ was first published in 1777. It arose out of a
8365,NOTE,conversation in which Morgann expressed his belief that Shakespeare
8366,NOTE,never meant Falstaff for a coward. He was challenged to explain and
8367,NOTE,"support in print what was considered an extraordinary paradox, and his"
8368,NOTE,"essay bears on its title-page the quotation, 'I am not John of Gaunt,"
8369,NOTE,"your grandfather: but yet no coward, Hal'--one of Falstaff's few serious"
8370,NOTE,sentences. But Morgann did not confine himself to the question of
8371,NOTE,"Falstaff's cowardice; he analysed the whole character, and incidentally"
8372,NOTE,"touched on many points in Shakespearean criticism. 'The reader,' he"
8373,NOTE,"observes, 'will not need to be told that this inquiry will resolve"
8374,NOTE,"itself of course into a critique on the genius, the arts, and the"
8375,NOTE,"conduct, of Shakespeare: for what is Falstaff, what Lear, what Hamlet,"
8376,NOTE,"or Othello, but different modifications of Shakespeare's thought? It is"
8377,NOTE,true that this inquiry is narrowed almost to a single point; but general
8378,NOTE,criticism is as uninstructive as it is easy: Shakespeare deserves to be
8379,NOTE,considered in detail;--a task hitherto unattempted.'
8380,NOTE,
8381,NOTE,The last words are significant. Morgann was conscious that he was
8382,NOTE,striking out a new line. The Eighteenth Century critics had done much
8383,NOTE,for Shakespeare in the way of scholarship; some of them had praised him
8384,NOTE,well and blamed him well; but they had done little to interpret the
8385,NOTE,process of his imagination from within. This was what Morgann attempted.
8386,NOTE,"His attitude towards Shakespeare is that of Goethe, Coleridge, Lamb,"
8387,NOTE,"Hazlitt. The dangers of his method might be illustrated from the Essay,"
8388,NOTE,but in his hands it yielded most valuable results. And though he did not
8389,NOTE,"attempt the eloquence of some of his successors, but wrote like a"
8390,NOTE,"cultivated ironical man of the world, he wrote delightfully; so that in"
8391,NOTE,"all respects his Essay, which has long been out of print, deserves to be"
8392,NOTE,republished and better known. [It was republished in Mr. Nichol Smith's
8393,NOTE,"excellent _Eighteenth Century Essays on Shakespeare_, 1903; and, in"
8394,NOTE,"1912, by itself, with an introduction by W. A. Gill.]"
8395,NOTE,
8396,NOTE,"Readers of Boswell (under the year 1783) will remember that Morgann, who"
8397,NOTE,"once met Johnson, favoured his biographer with two most characteristic"
8398,NOTE,"anecdotes. Boswell also records Johnson's judgment of Morgann's Essay,"
8399,NOTE,"which, says Mr. Swinburne, elicited from him 'as good a jest and as bad"
8400,NOTE,"a criticism as might have been expected.' Johnson, we are told, being"
8401,NOTE,"asked his opinion of the Essay, answered: 'Why, Sir, we shall have the"
8402,NOTE,"man come forth again; and as he has proved Falstaff to be no coward, he"
8403,NOTE,may prove Iago to be a very good character.' The following passage from
8404,NOTE,"Morgann's _Essay_ (p. 66 of the 1825 edition, p. 248 of Mr. Nichol"
8405,NOTE,"Smith's book) gives, I presume, his opinion of Johnson. Having referred"
8406,NOTE,"to Warburton, he adds: 'Another has since undertaken the custody of our"
8407,NOTE,"author, whom he seems to consider as a sort of wild Proteus or madman,"
8408,NOTE,"and accordingly knocks him down with the butt-end of his critical staff,"
8409,NOTE,"as often as he exceeds that line of sober discretion, which this learned"
8410,NOTE,"Editor appears to have chalked out for him: yet is this Editor,"
8411,NOTE,"notwithstanding, ""a man, take him for all in all,"" very highly"
8412,NOTE,respectable for his genius and his learning.'

8460,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8461,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Coleridge's one page of general criticism on _Antony and Cleopatra_
8462,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"contains some notable remarks. 'Of all Shakespeare's historical plays,'"
8463,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"he writes, '_Antony and Cleopatra_ is by far the most wonderful. There"
8464,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"is not one in which he has followed history so minutely, and yet there"
8465,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],are few in which he impresses the notion of angelic strength so
8466,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],much--perhaps none in which he impresses it more strongly. This is
8467,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],greatly owing to the manner in which the fiery force is sustained
8468,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],throughout.' In a later sentence he refers to the play as 'this
8469,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],astonishing drama.' In another he describes the style: '_feliciter
8470,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],audax_ is the motto for its style comparatively with that of
8471,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Shakespeare's other works.' And he translates this motto in the phrase
8472,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],'happy valiancy of style.'
8473,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8474,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Coleridge's assertion that in _Antony and Cleopatra_ Shakespeare
8475,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],followed history more minutely than in any other play might well be
8476,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],disputed; and his statement about the style of this drama requires some
8477,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],qualification in view of the results of later criticism as to the order
8478,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],of Shakespeare's works. The style is less individual than he imagined.
8479,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],On the whole it is common to the six or seven dramas subsequent to
8480,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"_Macbeth_, though in _Antony and Cleopatra_, probably the earliest of"
8481,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"them, its development is not yet complete. And we must add that this"
8482,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"style has certain special defects, unmentioned by Coleridge, as well as"
8483,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],the quality which he points out in it. But it is true that here that
8484,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],quality is almost continuously present; and in the phrase by which he
8485,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"describes it, as in his other phrases, he has signalised once for all"
8486,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],some of the most salient features of the drama.
8487,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8488,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"It is curious to notice, for example, alike in books and in"
8489,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"conversation, how often the first epithets used in reference to _Antony"
8490,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],and Cleopatra_ are 'wonderful' and 'astonishing.' And the main source of
8491,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],the feeling thus expressed seems to be the 'angelic strength' or 'fiery
8492,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"force' of which Coleridge wrote. The first of these two phrases is, I"
8493,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"think, the more entirely happy. Except perhaps towards the close, one is"
8494,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],not so conscious of fiery force as in certain other tragedies; but one
8495,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],is astonished at the apparent ease with which extraordinary effects are
8496,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"produced, the ease, if I may paraphrase Coleridge, of an angel moving"
8497,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],with a wave of the hand that heavy matter which men find so intractable.
8498,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],We feel this sovereign ease in contemplating Shakespeare's picture of
8499,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the world--a vast canvas, crowded with figures, glowing with colour and"
8500,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"a superb animation, reminding one spectator of Paul Veronese and another"
8501,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],of Rubens. We feel it again when we observe (as we can even without
8502,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"consulting Plutarch) the nature of the material; how bulky it was, and,"
8503,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"in some respects, how undramatic; and how the artist, though he could"
8504,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"not treat history like legend or fiction, seems to push whole masses"
8505,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"aside, and to shift and refashion the remainder, almost with the air of"
8506,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],an architect playing (at times rather carelessly) with a child's bricks.
8507,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8508,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Something similar is felt even in the portrait of Cleopatra. Marvellous
8509,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"as it is, the drawing of it suggests not so much the passionate"
8510,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"concentration or fiery force of _Macbeth_, as that sense of effortless"
8511,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],and exultant mastery which we feel in the portraits of Mercutio and
8512,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Falstaff. And surely it is a total mistake to find in this portrait any
8513,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],trace of the distempered mood which disturbs our pleasure in _Troilus
8514,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"and Cressida_. If the sonnets about the dark lady were, as need not be"
8515,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"doubted, in some degree autobiographical, Shakespeare may well have used"
8516,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],his personal experience both when he drew Cressida and when he drew
8517,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Cleopatra. And, if he did, the story in the later play was the nearer to"
8518,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"his own; for Antony might well have said what Troilus could never say,"
8519,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8520,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"When my love swears that she is made of truth,"
8521,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"I do believe her, though I know she lies."
8522,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8523,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"But in the later play, not only is the poet's vision unclouded, but his"
8524,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"whole nature, emotional as well as intellectual, is free. The subject no"
8525,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],more embitters or seduces him than the ambition of Macbeth. So that here
8526,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],too we feel the angelic strength of which Coleridge speaks. If we
8527,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"quarrelled with the phrase at all, it would be because we fancied we"
8528,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],could trace in Shakespeare's attitude something of the irony of
8529,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],superiority; and this may not altogether suit our conception of an
8530,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],angel.
8531,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8532,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],I have still another sentence to quote from Coleridge: 'The highest
8533,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"praise, or rather form of praise, of this play which I can offer in my"
8534,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"own mind, is the doubt which the perusal always occasions in me, whether"
8535,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the ""Antony and Cleopatra"" is not, in all exhibitions of a giant power"
8536,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"in its strength and vigour of maturity, a formidable rival of ""Macbeth,"""
8537,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"""Lear,"" ""Hamlet,"" and ""Othello.""' Now, unless the clause here about the"
8538,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],'giant power' may be taken to restrict the rivalry to the quality of
8539,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"angelic strength, Coleridge's doubt seems to show a lapse in critical"
8540,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"judgment. To regard this tragedy as a rival of the famous four, whether"
8541,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"on the stage or in the study, is surely an error. The world certainly"
8542,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"has not so regarded it; and, though the world's reasons for its verdicts"
8543,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"on works of art may be worth little, its mere verdict is worth much."
8544,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Here, it seems to me, that verdict must be accepted. One may notice"
8545,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"that, in calling _Antony and Cleopatra_ wonderful or astonishing, we"
8546,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"appear to be thinking first of the artist and his activity, while in the"
8547,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"case of the four famous tragedies it is the product of this activity,"
8548,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the thing presented, that first engrosses us. I know that I am stating"
8549,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"this difference too sharply, but I believe that it is often felt; and,"
8550,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"if this is so, the fact is significant. It implies that, although"
8551,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],_Antony and Cleopatra_ may be for us as wonderful an achievement as the
8552,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"greatest of Shakespeare's plays, it has not an equal value. Besides, in"
8553,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the attempt to rank it with them there is involved something more, and"
8554,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"more important, than an error in valuation. There is a failure to"
8555,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"discriminate the peculiar marks of _Antony and Cleopatra_ itself, marks"
8556,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"which, whether or no it be the equal of the earlier tragedies, make it"
8557,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],decidedly different. If I speak first of some of these differences it is
8558,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"because they thus contribute to the individuality of the play, and"
8559,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],because they seem often not to be distinctly apprehended in criticism.
8560,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8561,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8562,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],1.
8563,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8564,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Why, let us begin by asking, is _Antony and Cleopatra_, though so"
8565,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"wonderful an achievement, a play rarely acted? For a tragedy, it is not"
8566,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"painful. Though unfit for children, it cannot be called indecent; some"
8567,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"slight omissions, and such a flattening of the heroine's part as might"
8568,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"confidently be expected, would leave it perfectly presentable. It is, no"
8569,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"doubt, in the third and fourth Acts, very defective in construction."
8570,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Even on the Elizabethan stage, where scene followed scene without a"
8571,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"pause, this must have been felt; and in our theatres it would be felt"
8572,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"much more. There, in fact, these two and forty scenes could not possibly"
8573,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],be acted as they stand. But defective construction would not distress
8574,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the bulk of an audience, if the matter presented were that of _Hamlet_"
8575,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"or _Othello_, of _Lear_ or _Macbeth_. The matter, then, must lack"
8576,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],something which is present in those tragedies; and it is mainly owing to
8577,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],this difference in substance that _Antony and Cleopatra_ has never
8578,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],attained their popularity either on the stage or off it.
8579,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8580,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Most of Shakespeare's tragedies are dramatic, in a special sense of the"
8581,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"word as well as in its general sense, from beginning to end. The story"
8582,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],is not merely exciting and impressive from the movement of conflicting
8583,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"forces towards a terrible issue, but from time to time there come"
8584,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"situations and events which, even apart from their bearing on this"
8585,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"issue, appeal most powerfully to the dramatic feelings--scenes of action"
8586,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"or passion which agitate the audience with alarm, horror, painful"
8587,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"expectation, or absorbing sympathies and antipathies. Think of the"
8588,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"street fights in _Romeo and Juliet_, the killing of Mercutio and Tybalt,"
8589,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the rapture of the lovers, and their despair when Romeo is banished."
8590,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Think of the ghost-scenes in the first Act of _Hamlet_, the passion of"
8591,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the early soliloquies, the scene between Hamlet and Ophelia, the"
8592,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"play-scene, the sparing of the King at prayer, the killing of Polonius."
8593,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Is not _Hamlet_, if you choose so to regard it, the best melodrama in"
8594,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the world? Think at your leisure of _Othello_, _Lear_, and _Macbeth_"
8595,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],from the same point of view; but consider here and now even the two
8596,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"tragedies which, as dealing with Roman history, are companions of"
8597,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],_Antony and Cleopatra_. Recall in _Julius Cæsar_ the first suggestion of
8598,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the murder, the preparation for it in a 'tempest dropping fire,' the"
8599,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"murder itself, the speech of Antony over the corpse, and the tumult of"
8600,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the furious crowd; in _Coriolanus_ the bloody battles on the stage, the"
8601,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"scene in which the hero attains the consulship, the scene of rage in"
8602,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],which he is banished. And remember that in each of these seven tragedies
8603,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],the matter referred to is contained in the first three Acts.
8604,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8605,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],In the first three Acts of our play what is there resembling this?
8606,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Almost nothing. People converse, discuss, accuse one another, excuse"
8607,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"themselves, mock, describe, drink together, arrange a marriage, meet and"
8608,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"part; but they do not kill, do not even tremble or weep. We see hardly"
8609,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],one violent movement; until the battle of Actium is over we witness
8610,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"scarcely any vehement passion; and that battle, as it is a naval action,"
8611,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"we do not see. Even later, Enobarbus, when he dies, simply dies; he does"
8612,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"not kill himself.[2] We hear wonderful talk; but it is not talk, like"
8613,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"that of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, or that of Othello and Iago, at which"
8614,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],we hold our breath. The scenes that we remember first are those that
8615,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"portray Cleopatra; Cleopatra coquetting, tormenting, beguiling her lover"
8616,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],to stay; Cleopatra left with her women and longing for him; Cleopatra
8617,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],receiving the news of his marriage; Cleopatra questioning the messenger
8618,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],about Octavia's personal appearance. But this is to say that the scenes
8619,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],we remember first are the least indispensable to the plot. One at least
8620,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"is not essential to it at all. And this, the astonishing scene where she"
8621,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"storms at the messenger, strikes him, and draws her dagger on him, is"
8622,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],the one passage in the first half of the drama that contains either an
8623,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],explosion of passion or an exciting bodily action. Nor is this all. The
8624,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"first half of the play, though it forebodes tragedy, is not decisively"
8625,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],tragic in tone. Certainly the Cleopatra scenes are not so. We read
8626,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"them, and we should witness them, in delighted wonder and even with"
8627,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"amusement. The only scene that can vie with them, that of the revel on"
8628,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Pompey's ship, though full of menace, is in great part humorous."
8629,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Enobarbus, in this part of the play, is always humorous. Even later,"
8630,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"when the tragic tone is deepening, the whipping of Thyreus, in spite of"
8631,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Antony's rage, moves mirth. A play of which all this can truly be said"
8632,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"may well be as masterly as _Othello_ or _Macbeth_, and more delightful;"
8633,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"but, in the greater part of its course, it cannot possibly excite the"
8634,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],same emotions. It makes no attempt to do so; and to regard it as though
8635,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],it made this attempt is to miss its specific character and the intention
8636,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],of its author.
8637,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8638,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],That character depends only in part on Shakespeare's fidelity to his
8639,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"historical authority, a fidelity which, I may remark, is often greatly"
8640,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],exaggerated. For Shakespeare did not merely present the story of ten
8641,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"years as though it occupied perhaps one fifth of that time, nor did he"
8642,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"merely invent freely, but in critical places he effected startling"
8643,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],changes in the order and combination of events. Still it may be said
8644,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"that, dealing with a history so famous, he could not well make the first"
8645,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"half of his play very exciting, moving, or tragic. And this is true so"
8646,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"far as mere situations and events are concerned. But, if he had chosen,"
8647,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],he might easily have heightened the tone and tension in another way. He
8648,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"might have made the story of Antony's attempt to break his bondage, and"
8649,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the story of his relapse, extremely exciting, by portraying with all his"
8650,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],force the severity of the struggle and the magnitude of the fatal step.
8651,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8652,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],And the structure of the play might seem at first to suggest this
8653,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"intention. At the opening, Antony is shown almost in the beginning of"
8654,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"his infatuation; for Cleopatra is not sure of her power over him, exerts"
8655,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"all her fascination to detain him, and plays the part of the innocent"
8656,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],victim who has yielded to passion and must now expect to be deserted by
8657,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],her seducer. Alarmed and ashamed at the news of the results of his
8658,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"inaction, he rouses himself, tears himself away, and speeds to Italy."
8659,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],His very coming is enough to frighten Pompey into peace. He reconciles
8660,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"himself with Octavius, and, by his marriage with the good and beautiful"
8661,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Octavia, seems to have knit a bond of lasting amity with her brother,"
8662,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],and to have guarded himself against the passion that threatened him with
8663,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"ruin. At this point his power, the world's peace, and his own peace,"
8664,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],appear to be secured; his fortune has mounted to its apex. But soon
8665,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],(very much sooner than in Plutarch's story) comes the downward turn or
8666,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],counter-stroke. New causes of offence arise between the brothers-in-law.
8667,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],To remove them Octavia leaves her husband in Athens and hurries to Rome.
8668,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Immediately Antony returns to Cleopatra and, surrendering himself at"
8669,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],once and wholly to her enchantment is quickly driven to his doom.
8670,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8671,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Now Shakespeare, I say, with his matchless power of depicting an inward"
8672,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"struggle, might have made this story, even where it could not furnish"
8673,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"him with thrilling incidents, the source of powerful tragic emotions;"
8674,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"and, in doing so, he would have departed from his authority merely in"
8675,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],his conception of the hero's character. But he does no such thing till
8676,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],the catastrophe is near. Antony breaks away from Cleopatra without any
8677,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],strenuous conflict. No serious doubt of his return is permitted to
8678,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],agitate us. We are almost assured of it through the impression made on
8679,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"us by Octavius, through occasional glimpses into Antony's mind, through"
8680,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the absence of any doubt in Enobarbus, through scenes in Alexandria"
8681,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"which display Cleopatra and display her irresistible. And, finally, the"
8682,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"downward turn itself, the fatal step of Antony's return, is shown"
8683,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"without the slightest emphasis. Nay, it is not shown, it is only"
8684,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],reported; and not a line portrays any inward struggle preceding it. On
8685,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"this side also, then, the drama makes no attempt to rival the other"
8686,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],tragedies; and it was essential to its own peculiar character and its
8687,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"most transcendent effects that this attempt should not be made, but that"
8688,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Antony's passion should be represented as a force which he could hardly
8689,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"even desire to resist. By the very scheme of the work, therefore, tragic"
8690,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],impressions of any great volume or depth were reserved for the last
8691,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"stage of the conflict; while the main interest, down to the battle of"
8692,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Actium, was directed to matters exceedingly interesting and even, in the"
8693,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"wider sense, dramatic, but not overtly either terrible or piteous: on"
8694,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the one hand, to the political aspect of the story; on the other, to the"
8695,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],personal causes which helped to make the issue inevitable.
8696,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8697,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8698,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],2.
8699,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8700,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],The political situation and its development are simple. The story is
8701,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"taken up almost where it was left, years before, in _Julius Cæsar_."
8702,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"There Brutus and Cassius, to prevent the rule of one man, assassinate"
8703,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Cæsar. Their purpose is condemned to failure, not merely because they"
8704,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"make mistakes, but because that political necessity which Napoleon"
8705,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],identified with destiny requires the rule of one man. They spill Cæsar's
8706,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"blood, but his spirit walks abroad and turns their swords against their"
8707,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"own breasts; and the world is left divided among three men, his friends"
8708,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],and his heir. Here _Antony and Cleopatra_ takes up the tale; and its
8709,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"business, from this point of view, is to show the reduction of these"
8710,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],three to one. That Lepidus will not be this one was clear already in
8711,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"_Julius Cæsar_; it must be Octavius or Antony. Both ambitious, they are"
8712,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],also men of such opposite tempers that they would scarcely long agree
8713,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"even if they wished to, and even if destiny were not stronger than they."
8714,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"As it is, one of them has fixed his eyes on the end, sacrifices"
8715,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"everything for it, uses everything as a means to it. The other, though"
8716,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"far the greater soldier and worshipped by his followers, has no such"
8717,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"singleness of aim; nor yet is power, however desirable to him, the most"
8718,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],desirable thing in the world. At the beginning he is risking it for
8719,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"love; at the end he has lost his half of the world, and lost his life,"
8720,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],and Octavius rules alone. Whether Shakespeare had this clearly in his
8721,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],mind is a question neither answerable nor important; this is what came
8722,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],out of his mind.
8723,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8724,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Shakespeare, I think, took little interest in the character of Octavius,"
8725,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],and he has not made it wholly clear. It is not distinct in Plutarch's
8726,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],'Life of Antony'; and I have not found traces that the poet studied
8727,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],closely the 'Life of Octavius' included in North's volume. To
8728,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Shakespeare he is one of those men, like Bolingbroke and Ulysses, who"
8729,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"have plenty of 'judgment' and not much 'blood.' Victory in the world,"
8730,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"according to the poet, almost always goes to such men; and he makes us"
8731,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"respect, fear, and dislike them. His Octavius is very formidable. His"
8732,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],cold determination half paralyses Antony; it is so even in _Julius
8733,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Cæsar_. In _Antony and Cleopatra_ Octavius is more than once in the
8734,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],wrong; but he never admits it; he silently pushes his rival a step
8735,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"backward; and, when he ceases to fear, he shows contempt. He neither"
8736,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"enjoys war nor is great in it; at first, therefore, he is anxious about"
8737,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the power of Pompey, and stands in need of Antony. As soon as Antony's"
8738,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"presence has served his turn, and he has patched up a union with him and"
8739,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"seen him safely off to Athens, he destroys first Pompey and next"
8740,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Lepidus. Then, dexterously using Antony's faithlessness to Octavia and"
8741,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"excesses in the East in order to put himself in the right, he makes for"
8742,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],his victim with admirable celerity while he is still drunk with the joy
8743,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"of reunion with Cleopatra. For his ends Octavius is perfectly efficient,"
8744,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],but he is so partly from his limitations. One phrase of his is
8745,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],exceedingly characteristic. When Antony in rage and desperation
8746,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"challenges him to single combat, Octavius calls him 'the old ruffian.'"
8747,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"There is a horrid aptness in the phrase, but it disgusts us. It is"
8748,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"shameful in this boy, as hard and smooth as polished steel, to feel at"
8749,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],such a time nothing of the greatness of his victim and the tragedy of
8750,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"his victim's fall. Though the challenge of Antony is absurd, we would"
8751,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],give much to see them sword to sword. And when Cleopatra by her death
8752,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"cheats the conqueror of his prize, we feel unmixed delight."
8753,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8754,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],The doubtful point in the character is this. Plutarch says that Octavius
8755,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],was reported to love his sister dearly; and Shakespeare's Octavius
8756,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"several times expresses such love. When, then, he proposed the marriage"
8757,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"with Antony (for of course it was he who spoke through Agrippa), was he"
8758,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"honest, or was he laying a trap and, in doing so, sacrificing his"
8759,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],sister? Did he hope the marriage would really unite him with his
8760,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],brother-in-law; or did he merely mean it to be a source of future
8761,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"differences; or did he calculate that, whether it secured peace or"
8762,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"dissension, it would in either case bring him great advantage?"
8763,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Shakespeare, who was quite as intelligent as his readers, must have"
8764,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],asked himself some such question; but he may not have cared to answer it
8765,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"even to himself; and, in any case, he has left the actor (at least the"
8766,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],actor in days later than his own) to choose an answer. If I were forced
8767,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"to choose, I should take the view that Octavius was, at any rate, not"
8768,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],wholly honest; partly because I think it best suits Shakespeare's usual
8769,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],way of conceiving a character of the kind; partly because Plutarch
8770,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],construed in this manner Octavius's behaviour in regard to his sister at
8771,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"a later time, and this hint might naturally influence the poet's way of"
8772,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],imagining his earlier action.[3]
8773,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8774,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Though the character of Octavius is neither attractive nor wholly clear,"
8775,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"his figure is invested with a certain tragic dignity, because he is felt"
8776,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"to be the Man of Destiny, the agent of forces against which the"
8777,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],intentions of an individual would avail nothing. He is represented as
8778,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"having himself some feeling of this sort. His lament over Antony, his"
8779,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"grief that their stars were irreconcilable, may well be genuine, though"
8780,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],we should be surer if it were uttered in soliloquy. His austere words to
8781,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Octavia again probably speak his true mind:
8782,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8783,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Be you not troubled with the time, which drives"
8784,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],O'er your content these strong necessities;
8785,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],But let determined things to destiny
8786,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Hold unbewailed their way.
8787,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8788,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],In any case the feeling of fate comes through to us. It is aided by
8789,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],slight touches of supernatural effect; first in the Soothsayer's warning
8790,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],to Antony that his genius or angel is overpowered whenever he is near
8791,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Octavius; then in the strangely effective scene where Antony's soldiers,"
8792,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"in the night before his last battle, hear music in the air or under the"
8793,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],earth:
8794,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8795,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,"
8796,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Now leaves him.
8797,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8798,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],And to the influence of this feeling in giving impressiveness to the
8799,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],story is added that of the immense scale and world-wide issue of the
8800,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],conflict. Even the distances traversed by fleets and armies enhance this
8801,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],effect.
8802,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8803,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],And yet there seems to be something half-hearted in Shakespeare's appeal
8804,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"here, something even ironical in his presentation of this conflict. Its"
8805,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"external magnitude, like Antony's magnificence in lavishing realms and"
8806,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"gathering the kings of the East in his support, fails to uplift or"
8807,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],dilate the imagination. The struggle in Lear's little island seems to us
8808,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],to have an infinitely wider scope. It is here that we are sometimes
8809,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"reminded of _Troilus and Cressida_, and the cold and disenchanting light"
8810,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],that is there cast on the Trojan War. The spectacle which he portrays
8811,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],leaves Shakespeare quite undazzled; he even makes it appear inwardly
8812,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"small. The lordship of the world, we ask ourselves, what is it worth,"
8813,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],and in what spirit do these 'world-sharers' contend for it? They are no
8814,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],champions of their country like Henry V. The conqueror knows not even
8815,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the glory of battle. Their aims, for all we see, are as personal as if"
8816,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],they were captains of banditti; and they are followed merely from
8817,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],self-interest or private attachment. The scene on Pompey's galley is
8818,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],full of this irony. One 'third part of the world' is carried drunk to
8819,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],bed. In the midst of this mock boon-companionship the pirate whispers to
8820,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],his leader to cut first the cable of his ship and then the throats of
8821,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],the two other Emperors; and at the moment we should not greatly care if
8822,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Pompey took the advice. Later, a short scene, totally useless to the"
8823,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"plot and purely satiric in its purport, is slipped in to show how"
8824,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Ventidius fears to pursue his Parthian conquests because it is not safe
8825,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],for Antony's lieutenant to outdo his master.[4] A painful sense of
8826,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],hollowness oppresses us. We know too well what must happen in a world so
8827,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"splendid, so false, and so petty. We turn for relief from the political"
8828,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],game to those who are sure to lose it; to those who love some human
8829,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"being better than a prize, to Eros and Charmian and Iras; to Enobarbus,"
8830,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"whom the world corrupts, but who has a heart that can break with shame;"
8831,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"to the lovers, who seem to us to find in death something better than"
8832,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],their victor's life.
8833,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8834,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"This presentation of the outward conflict has two results. First, it"
8835,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],blunts our feeling of the greatness of Antony's fall from prosperity.
8836,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Indeed this feeling, which we might expect to be unusually acute, is"
8837,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"hardly so; it is less acute, for example, than the like feeling in the"
8838,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"case of Richard II., who loses so much smaller a realm. Our deeper"
8839,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"sympathies are focussed rather on Antony's heart, on the inward fall to"
8840,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"which the enchantment of passion leads him, and the inward recovery"
8841,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],which succeeds it. And the second result is this. The greatness of
8842,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Antony and Cleopatra in their fall is so much heightened by contrast
8843,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"with the world they lose and the conqueror who wins it, that the"
8844,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"positive element in the final tragic impression, the element of"
8845,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"reconciliation, is strongly emphasised. The peculiar effect of the drama"
8846,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"depends partly, as we have seen, on the absence of decidedly tragic"
8847,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],scenes and events in its first half; but it depends quite as much on
8848,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],this emphasis. In any Shakespearean tragedy we watch some elect spirit
8849,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"colliding, partly through its error and defect, with a superhuman power"
8850,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"which bears it down; and yet we feel that this spirit, even in the error"
8851,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"and defect, rises by its greatness into ideal union with the power that"
8852,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],overwhelms it. In some tragedies this latter feeling is relatively weak.
8853,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"In _Antony and Cleopatra_ it is unusually strong; stronger, with some"
8854,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"readers at least, than the fear and grief and pity with which they"
8855,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],contemplate the tragic error and the advance of doom.
8856,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8857,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8858,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],3.
8859,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8860,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],The two aspects of the tragedy are presented together in the opening
8861,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],scene. Here is the first. In Cleopatra's palace one friend of Antony is
8862,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"describing to another, just arrived from Rome, the dotage of their great"
8863,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"general; and, as the lovers enter, he exclaims:"
8864,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8865,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Look, where they come:"
8866,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Take but good note, and you shall see in him"
8867,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],The triple pillar of the world transformed
8868,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.
8869,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8870,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],With the next words the other aspect appears:
8871,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8872,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"CLEO. If it be love indeed, tell me how much."
8873,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8874,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],ANT. There's beggary in the love that can be reckoned.
8875,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8876,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],CLEO. I'll set a bourne how far to be beloved.
8877,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8878,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"ANT. Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth."
8879,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8880,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"And directly after, when he is provoked by reminders of the news from"
8881,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Rome:
8882,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8883,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch"
8884,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.
8885,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
8886,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life
8887,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Is to do thus.
8888,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8889,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Here is the tragic excess, but with it the tragic greatness, the"
8890,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"capacity of finding in something the infinite, and of pursuing it into"
8891,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],the jaws of death.
8892,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8893,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],The two aspects are shown here with the exaggeration proper in dramatic
8894,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"characters. Neither the phrase 'a strumpet's fool,' nor the assertion"
8895,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"'the nobleness of life is to do thus,' answers to the total effect of"
8896,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],the play. But the truths they exaggerate are equally essential; and the
8897,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],commoner mistake in criticism is to understate the second. It is plain
8898,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],that the love of Antony and Cleopatra is destructive; that in some way
8899,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"it clashes with the nature of things; that, while they are sitting in"
8900,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"their paradise like gods, its walls move inward and crush them at last"
8901,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],to death. This is no invention of moralising critics; it is in the play;
8902,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],and any one familiar with Shakespeare would expect beforehand to find it
8903,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"there. But then to forget because of it the other side, to deny the name"
8904,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"of love to this ruinous passion, to speak as though the lovers had"
8905,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"utterly missed the good of life, is to mutilate the tragedy and to"
8906,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],ignore a great part of its effect upon us. For we sympathise with them
8907,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],in their passion; we feel in it the infinity there is in man; even while
8908,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],we acquiesce in their defeat we are exulting in their victory; and when
8909,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"they have vanished we say,"
8910,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8911,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the odds is gone,"
8912,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],And there is nothing left remarkable
8913,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Beneath the visiting moon.
8914,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8915,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Though we hear nothing from Shakespeare of the cruelty of Plutarch's
8916,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Antony, or of the misery caused by his boundless profusion, we do not"
8917,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"feel the hero of the tragedy to be a man of the noblest type, like"
8918,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Brutus, Hamlet, or Othello. He seeks power merely for himself, and uses"
8919,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"it for his own pleasure. He is in some respects unscrupulous; and, while"
8920,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],it would be unjust to regard his marriage exactly as if it were one in
8921,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"private life, we resent his treatment of Octavia, whose character"
8922,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Shakespeare was obliged to leave a mere sketch, lest our feeling for the"
8923,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"hero and heroine should be too much chilled. Yet, for all this, we"
8924,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"sympathise warmly with Antony, are greatly drawn to him, and are"
8925,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],inclined to regard him as a noble nature half spoiled by his time.
8926,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8927,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"It is a large, open, generous, expansive nature, quite free from envy,"
8928,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"capable of great magnanimity, even of entire devotion. Antony is"
8929,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"unreserved, naturally straightforward, we may almost say simple. He can"
8930,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"admit faults, accept advice and even reproof, take a jest against"
8931,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"himself with good-humour. He is courteous (to Lepidus, for example, whom"
8932,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Octavius treats with cold contempt); and, though he can be exceedingly"
8933,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"dignified, he seems to prefer a blunt though sympathetic plainness,"
8934,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],which is one cause of the attachment of his soldiers. He has none of the
8935,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"faults of the brooder, the sentimentalist, or the man of principle; his"
8936,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],nature tends to splendid action and lusty enjoyment. But he is neither a
8937,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"mere soldier nor a mere sensualist. He has imagination, the temper of an"
8938,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"artist who revels in abundant and rejoicing appetites, feasts his senses"
8939,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"on the glow and richness of life, flings himself into its mirth and"
8940,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"revelry, yet feels the poetry in all this, and is able also to put it"
8941,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],by and be more than content with the hardships of adventure. Such a man
8942,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"could never have sought a crown by a murder like Macbeth's, or, like"
8943,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Brutus, have killed on principle the man who loved him, or have lost the"
8944,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],world for a Cressida.
8945,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8946,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Beside this strain of poetry he has a keen intellect, a swift perception"
8947,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"of the lie of things, and much quickness in shaping a course to suit"
8948,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"them. In _Julius Cæsar_ he shows this after the assassination, when he"
8949,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],appears as a dexterous politician as well as a warm-hearted friend. He
8950,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"admires what is fine, and can fully appreciate the nobility of Brutus;"
8951,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"but he is sure that Brutus's ideas are moonshine, that (as he says in"
8952,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"our play) Brutus is mad; and, since his mighty friend, who was"
8953,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"incomparably the finest thing in the world, has perished, he sees no"
8954,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"reason why the inheritance should not be his own. Full of sorrow, he yet"
8955,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"uses his sorrow like an artist to work on others, and greets his success"
8956,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],with the glee of a successful adventurer. In the earlier play he proves
8957,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"himself a master of eloquence, and especially of pathos; and he does so"
8958,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],again in the later. With a few words about his fall he draws tears from
8959,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],his followers and even from the caustic humorist Enobarbus. Like Richard
8960,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"II., he sees his own fall with the eyes of a poet, but a poet much"
8961,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"greater than the young Shakespeare, who could never have written"
8962,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Antony's marvellous speech about the sunset clouds. But we listen to
8963,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Antony, as we do not to Richard, with entire sympathy, partly because he"
8964,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"is never unmanly, partly because he himself is sympathetic and longs for"
8965,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],sympathy.
8966,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8967,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"The first of living soldiers, an able politician, a most persuasive"
8968,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"orator, Antony nevertheless was not born to rule the world. He enjoys"
8969,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"being a great man, but he has not the love of rule for rule's sake."
8970,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Power for him is chiefly a means to pleasure. The pleasure he wants is
8971,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"so huge that he needs a huge power; but half the world, even a third of"
8972,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"it, would suffice. He will not pocket wrongs, but he shows not the"
8973,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],slightest wish to get rid of his fellow Triumvirs and reign alone. He
8974,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],never minded being subordinate to Julius Cæsar. By women he is not only
8975,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],attracted but governed; from the effect of Cleopatra's taunts we can see
8976,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],that he had been governed by Fulvia. Nor has he either the patience or
8977,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the steadfastness of a born ruler. He contends fitfully, and is prone to"
8978,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],take the step that is easiest at the moment. This is the reason why he
8979,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],consents to marry Octavia. It seems the shortest way out of an awkward
8980,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],situation. He does not intend even to try to be true to her. He will not
8981,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],think of the distant consequences.
8982,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
8983,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],A man who loved power as much as thousands of insignificant people love
8984,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"it, would have made a sterner struggle than Antony's against his"
8985,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],enchantment. He can hardly be said to struggle at all. He brings himself
8986,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],to leave Cleopatra only because he knows he will return. In every moment
8987,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"of his absence, whether he wake or sleep, a siren music in his blood is"
8988,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"singing him back to her; and to this music, however he may be occupied,"
8989,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],the soul within his soul leans and listens. The joy of life had always
8990,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],culminated for him in the love of women: he could say 'no' to none of
8991,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],them: of Octavia herself he speaks like a poet. When he meets Cleopatra
8992,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"he finds his Absolute. She satisfies, nay glorifies, his whole being."
8993,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"She intoxicates his senses. Her wiles, her taunts, her furies and"
8994,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"meltings, her laughter and tears, bewitch him all alike. She loves what"
8995,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"he loves, and she surpasses him. She can drink him to his bed, out-jest"
8996,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"his practical jokes, out-act the best actress who ever amused him,"
8997,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"out-dazzle his own magnificence. She is his play-fellow, and yet a great"
8998,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"queen. Angling in the river, playing billiards, flourishing the sword he"
8999,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"used at Philippi, hopping forty paces in a public street, she remains"
9000,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"an enchantress. Her spirit is made of wind and flame, and the poet in"
9001,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],him worships her no less than the man. He is under no illusion about
9002,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"her, knows all her faults, sees through her wiles, believes her capable"
9003,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],of betraying him. It makes no difference. She is his heart's desire made
9004,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],perfect. To love her is what he was born for. What have the gods in
9005,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],heaven to say against it? To imagine heaven is to imagine her; to die is
9006,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],to rejoin her. To deny that this is love is the madness of morality. He
9007,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],gives her every atom of his heart.
9008,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9009,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"She destroys him. Shakespeare, availing himself of the historic fact,"
9010,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"portrays, on Antony's return to her, the suddenness and the depth of his"
9011,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"descent. In spite of his own knowledge, the protests of his captains,"
9012,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the entreaties even of a private soldier, he fights by sea simply and"
9013,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"solely because she wishes it. Then in mid-battle, when she flies, he"
9014,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],deserts navy and army and his faithful thousands and follows her. 'I
9015,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"never saw an action of such shame,' cries Scarus; and we feel the"
9016,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],dishonour of the hero keenly. Then Shakespeare begins to raise him
9017,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"again. First, his own overwhelming sense of shame redeems him. Next, we"
9018,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],watch the rage of the dying lion. Then the mere sally before the final
9019,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],defeat--a sally dismissed by Plutarch in three lines--is magnified into
9020,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"a battle, in which Antony displays to us, and himself feels for the last"
9021,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"time, the glory of his soldiership. And, throughout, the magnanimity and"
9022,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],gentleness which shine through his desperation endear him to us. How
9023,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"beautiful is his affection for his followers and even for his servants,"
9024,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],and the devotion they return! How noble his reception of the news that
9025,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Enobarbus has deserted him! How touchingly significant the refusal of
9026,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Eros either to kill him or survive him! How pathetic and even sublime
9027,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],the completeness of his love for Cleopatra! His anger is born and dies
9028,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"in an hour. One tear, one kiss, outweighs his ruin. He believes she has"
9029,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"sold him to his enemy, yet he kills himself because he hears that she is"
9030,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"dead. When, dying, he learns that she has deceived him once more, no"
9031,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],thought of reproach crosses his mind: he simply asks to be carried to
9032,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"her. He knows well that she is not capable of dying because he dies, but"
9033,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"that does not sting him; when, in his last agony, he calls for wine that"
9034,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"he may gain a moment's strength to speak, it is to advise her for the"
9035,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],days to come. Shakespeare borrowed from Plutarch the final speech of
9036,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Antony. It is fine, but it is not miraculous. The miraculous speeches"
9037,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],belong only to his own hero:
9038,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9039,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"I am dying, Egypt, dying; only"
9040,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"I here importune death awhile, until"
9041,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Of many thousand kisses the poor last
9042,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],I lay upon thy lips;
9043,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9044,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],or the first words he utters when he hears of Cleopatra's death:
9045,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9046,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Unarm, Eros: the long day's task is done,"
9047,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],And we must sleep.
9048,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9049,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"If he meant the task of statesman and warrior, that is not what his"
9050,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],words mean to us. They remind us of words more familiar and less great--
9051,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9052,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],No rest but the grave for the pilgrim of love.
9053,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9054,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],And he is more than love's pilgrim; he is love's martyr.
9055,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9056,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9057,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],4.
9058,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9059,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"To reserve a fragment of an hour for Cleopatra, if it were not palpably"
9060,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"absurd, would seem an insult. If only one could hear her own remarks"
9061,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],upon it! But I had to choose between this absurdity and the plan of
9062,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],giving her the whole hour; and to that plan there was one fatal
9063,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],objection. She has been described (by Ten Brink) as a courtesan of
9064,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"genius. So brief a description must needs be incomplete, and Cleopatra"
9065,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"never forgets, nor, if we read aright, do we forget, that she is a"
9066,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],great queen. Still the phrase is excellent; only a public lecture is no
9067,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],occasion for the full analysis and illustration of the character it
9068,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],describes.
9069,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9070,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Shakespeare has paid Cleopatra a unique compliment. The hero dies in the
9071,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"fourth Act, and the whole of the fifth is devoted to the heroine.[5] In"
9072,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"that Act she becomes unquestionably a tragic character, but, it appears"
9073,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"to me, not till then. This, no doubt, is a heresy; but as I cannot help"
9074,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"holding it, and as it is connected with the remarks already made on the"
9075,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"first half of the play, I will state it more fully. Cleopatra stands in"
9076,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],a group with Hamlet and Falstaff. We might join with them Iago if he
9077,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],were not decidedly their inferior in one particular quality. They are
9078,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"inexhaustible. You feel that, if they were alive and you spent your"
9079,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"whole life with them, their infinite variety could never be staled by"
9080,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"custom; they would continue every day to surprise, perplex, and delight"
9081,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"you. Shakespeare has bestowed on each of them, though they differ so"
9082,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"much, his own originality, his genius. He has given it most fully to"
9083,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Hamlet, to whom none of the chambers of experience is shut, and perhaps"
9084,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"more of it to Cleopatra than to Falstaff. Nevertheless, if we ask"
9085,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"whether Cleopatra, in the first four Acts, is a tragic figure like"
9086,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Hamlet, we surely cannot answer 'yes.' Naturally it does not follow that"
9087,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"she is a comic figure like Falstaff. This would be absurd; for, even if"
9088,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"she were ridiculous like Falstaff, she is not ridiculous to herself; she"
9089,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],is no humorist. And yet there is a certain likeness. She shares a
9090,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"weakness with Falstaff--vanity; and when she displays it, as she does"
9091,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"quite naively (for instance, in the second interview with the"
9092,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Messenger), she does become comic. Again, though like Falstaff she is"
9093,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"irresistible and carries us away no less than the people around her, we"
9094,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"are secretly aware, in the midst of our delight, that her empire is"
9095,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"built on sand. And finally, as his love for the Prince gives dignity and"
9096,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"pathos to Falstaff in his overthrow, so what raises Cleopatra at last"
9097,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"into pure tragedy is, in part, that which some critics have denied her,"
9098,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],her love for Antony.
9099,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9100,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Many unpleasant things can be said of Cleopatra; and the more that are
9101,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],said the more wonderful she appears. The exercise of sexual attraction
9102,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],is the element of her life; and she has developed nature into a
9103,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],consummate art. When she cannot exert it on the present lover she
9104,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"imagines its effects on him in absence. Longing for the living, she"
9105,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],remembers with pride and joy the dead; and the past which the furious
9106,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Antony holds up to her as a picture of shame is, for her, glory. She"
9107,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"cannot see an ambassador, scarcely even a messenger, without desiring to"
9108,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"bewitch him. Her mind is saturated with this element. If she is dark, it"
9109,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],is because the sun himself has been amorous of her. Even when death is
9110,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],close at hand she imagines his touch as a lover's. She embraces him that
9111,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],she may overtake Iras and gain Antony's first kiss in the other world.
9112,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9113,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"She lives for feeling. Her feelings are, so to speak, sacred, and pain"
9114,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],must not come near her. She has tried numberless experiments to discover
9115,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the easiest way to die. Her body is exquisitely sensitive, and her"
9116,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],emotions marvellously swift. They are really so; but she exaggerates
9117,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"them so much, and exhibits them so continually for effect, that some"
9118,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"readers fancy them merely feigned. They are all-important, and everybody"
9119,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"must attend to them. She announces to her women that she is pale, or"
9120,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],sick and sullen; they must lead her to her chamber but must not speak to
9121,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"her. She is as strong and supple as a leopard, can drink down a master"
9122,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"of revelry, can raise her lover's helpless heavy body from the ground"
9123,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"into her tower with the aid only of two women; yet, when he is sitting"
9124,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"apart sunk in shame, she must be supported into his presence, she cannot"
9125,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"stand, her head droops, she will die (it is the opinion of Eros) unless"
9126,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],he comforts her. When she hears of his marriage and has discharged her
9127,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"rage, she bids her women bear her away; she faints; at least she would"
9128,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"faint, but that she remembers various questions she wants put to the"
9129,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Messenger about Octavia. Enobarbus has seen her die twenty times upon
9130,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],far poorer moment than the news that Antony is going to Rome.
9131,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9132,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Some of her feelings are violent, and, unless for a purpose, she does"
9133,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"not dream of restraining them; her sighs and tears are winds and waters,"
9134,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"storms and tempests. At times, as when she threatens to give Charmian"
9135,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"bloody teeth, or hales the luckless Messenger up and down by the hair,"
9136,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"strikes him and draws her knife on him, she resembles (if I dare say it)"
9137,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],Doll Tearsheet sublimated. She is a mother; but the threat of Octavius
9138,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],to destroy her children if she takes her own life passes by her like the
9139,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],wind (a point where Shakespeare contradicts Plutarch). She ruins a great
9140,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"man, but shows no sense of the tragedy of his ruin. The anguish of"
9141,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],spirit that appears in his language to his servants is beyond her; she
9142,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],has to ask Enobarbus what he means. Can we feel sure that she would not
9143,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],have sacrificed him if she could have saved herself by doing so? It is
9144,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],not even certain that she did not attempt it. Antony himself believes
9145,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],that she did--that the fleet went over to Octavius by her orders. That
9146,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],she and her people deny the charge proves nothing. The best we can say
9147,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"is that, if it were true, Shakespeare would have made that clear. She is"
9148,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"willing also to survive her lover. Her first thought, to follow him"
9149,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"after the high Roman fashion, is too great for her. She would live on if"
9150,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"she could, and would cheat her victor too of the best part of her"
9151,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],fortune. The thing that drives her to die is the certainty that she
9152,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],will be carried to Rome to grace his triumph. That alone decides her.[6]
9153,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9154,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],The marvellous thing is that the knowledge of all this makes hardly more
9155,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],difference to us than it did to Antony. It seems to us perfectly
9156,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"natural, nay, in a sense perfectly right, that her lover should be her"
9157,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"slave; that her women should adore her and die with her; that Enobarbus,"
9158,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"who foresaw what must happen, and who opposes her wishes and braves her"
9159,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"anger, should talk of her with rapture and feel no bitterness against"
9160,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"her; that Dolabella, after a minute's conversation, should betray to her"
9161,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],his master's intention and enable her to frustrate it. And when Octavius
9162,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"shows himself proof against her fascination, instead of admiring him we"
9163,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],turn from him with disgust and think him a disgrace to his species. Why?
9164,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],It is not that we consider him bound to fall in love with her. Enobarbus
9165,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],did not; Dolabella did not; we ourselves do not. The feeling she
9166,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"inspires was felt then, and is felt now, by women no less than men, and"
9167,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],would have been shared by Octavia herself. Doubtless she wrought magic
9168,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"on the senses, but she had not extraordinary beauty, like Helen's, such"
9169,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],beauty as seems divine.[7] Plutarch says so. The man who wrote the
9170,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],sonnets to the dark lady would have known it for himself. He goes out of
9171,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"his way to add to her age, and tells us of her wrinkles and the waning"
9172,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"of her lip. But Enobarbus, in his very mockery, calls her a wonderful"
9173,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"piece of work. Dolabella interrupts her with the cry, 'Most sovereign"
9174,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"creature,' and we echo it. And yet Octavius, face to face with her and"
9175,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"listening to her voice, can think only how best to trap her and drag her"
9176,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],to public dishonour in the streets of Rome. We forgive him only for his
9177,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],words when he sees her dead:
9178,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9179,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"She looks like sleep,"
9180,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],As she would catch another Antony
9181,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],In her strong toil of grace.
9182,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9183,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"And the words, I confess, sound to me more like Shakespeare's than his."
9184,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9185,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"That which makes her wonderful and sovereign laughs at definition, but"
9186,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"she herself came nearest naming it when, in the final speech (a passage"
9187,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"surpassed in poetry, if at all, only by the final speech of Othello),"
9188,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"she cries,"
9189,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9190,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],I am fire and air; my other elements
9191,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],I give to baser life.
9192,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9193,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],The fire and air which at death break from union with those other
9194,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"elements, transfigured them during her life, and still convert into"
9195,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],engines of enchantment the very things for which she is condemned. I can
9196,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],refer only to one. She loves Antony. We should marvel at her less and
9197,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],love her more if she loved him more--loved him well enough to follow him
9198,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],at once to death; but it is to blunder strangely to doubt that she loved
9199,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"him, or that her glorious description of him (though it was also meant"
9200,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],to work on Dolabella) came from her heart. Only the spirit of fire and
9201,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],air within her refuses to be trammelled or extinguished; burns its way
9202,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],through the obstacles of fortune and even through the resistance of her
9203,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],love and grief; and would lead her undaunted to fresh life and the
9204,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],conquest of new worlds. It is this which makes her 'strong toil of
9205,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],grace' unbreakable; speaks in her brows' bent and every tone and
9206,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],movement; glorifies the arts and the rages which in another would merely
9207,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"disgust or amuse us; and, in the final scenes of her life, flames into"
9208,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],such brilliance that we watch her entranced as she struggles for
9209,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"freedom, and thrilled with triumph as, conquered, she puts her conqueror"
9210,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],to scorn and goes to meet her lover in the splendour that crowned and
9211,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"robed her long ago, when her barge burnt on the water like a burnished"
9212,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"throne, and she floated to Cydnus on the enamoured stream to take him"
9213,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],captive for ever.[8]
9214,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],
9215,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Why is it that, although we close the book in a triumph which is more"
9216,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"than reconciliation, this is mingled, as we look back on the story, with"
9217,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"a sadness so peculiar, almost the sadness of disenchantment? Is it that,"
9218,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"when the glow has faded, Cleopatra's ecstasy comes to appear, I would"
9219,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"not say factitious, but an effort strained and prodigious as well as"
9220,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"glorious, not, like Othello's last speech, the final expression of"
9221,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"character, of thoughts and emotions which have dominated a whole life?"
9222,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"Perhaps this is so, but there is something more, something that sounds"
9223,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],paradoxical: we are saddened by the very fact that the catastrophe
9224,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],saddens us so little; it pains us that we should feel so much triumph
9225,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"and pleasure. In _Romeo and Juliet_, _Hamlet_, _Othello_, though in a"
9226,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"sense we accept the deaths of hero and heroine, we feel a keen sorrow."
9227,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"We look back, think how noble or beautiful they were, wish that fate had"
9228,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"opposed to them a weaker enemy, dream possibly of the life they might"
9229,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],then have led. Here we can hardly do this. With all our admiration and
9230,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],sympathy for the lovers we do not wish them to gain the world. It is
9231,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"better for the world's sake, and not less for their own, that they"
9232,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"should fail and die. At the very first they came before us, unlike those"
9233,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"others, unlike Coriolanus and even Macbeth, in a glory already"

9235,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],most unusual effect in their story is that this marvellous passion comes
9236,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"to adepts in the experience and art of passion, who might be expected to"
9237,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"have worn its charm away. Its splendour dazzles us; but, when the"
9238,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"splendour vanishes, we do not mourn, as we mourn for the love of Romeo"
9239,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"or Othello, that a thing so bright and good should die. And the fact"
9240,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],that we mourn so little saddens us.

9242,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],A comparison of Shakespearean tragedies seems to prove that the tragic
9243,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],emotions are stirred in the fullest possible measure only when such
9244,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],beauty or nobility of character is displayed as commands unreserved
9245,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"admiration or love; or when, in default of this, the forces which move"
9246,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"the agents, and the conflict which results from these forces, attain a"
9247,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],terrifying and overwhelming power. The four most famous tragedies
9248,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"satisfy one or both of these conditions; _Antony and Cleopatra_, though"
9249,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"a great tragedy, satisfies neither of them completely. But to say this"
9250,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"is not to criticise it. It does not attempt to satisfy these conditions,"
9251,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"and then fail in the attempt. It attempts something different, and"
9252,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],succeeds as triumphantly as _Othello_ itself. In doing so it gives us
9253,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"what no other tragedy can give, and it leaves us, no less than any"
9254,SHAKESPEARE'S _ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA_[1],"other, lost in astonishment at the powers which created it."

9295,NOTE C,"Since this lecture was published (_Quarterly Review_, April, 1906) two"

9297,NOTE C,"recently written on Shakespeare, I venture to say, shows more thorough"
9298,NOTE C,scholarship or better judgment than Mr. Case's edition in the Arden

9320,NOTE D,"Shakespeare, it seems clear, imagined Cleopatra as a gipsy. And this, I"
9321,NOTE D,"would suggest, may be the explanation of a word which has caused much"
9322,NOTE D,"difficulty. Antony, when 'all is lost,' exclaims (IV. x. 38):"
9323,NOTE D,
9324,NOTE D,"O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,--"
9325,NOTE D,"Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home,"
9326,NOTE D,"Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--"
9327,NOTE D,"Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,"
9328,NOTE D,Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss.
9329,NOTE D,
9330,NOTE D,Pope changed 'grave' in the first line into 'gay.' Others conjecture
9331,NOTE D,"'great' and 'grand.' Steevens says that 'grave' means 'deadly,' and"
9332,NOTE D,that the word 'is often used by Chapman' thus; and one of his two
9333,NOTE D,quotations supports his statement; but certainly in Shakespeare the word
9334,NOTE D,"does not elsewhere bear this sense. It could mean 'majestic,' as Johnson"
9335,NOTE D,"takes it here. But why should it not have its usual meaning? Cleopatra,"
9336,NOTE D,"we know, was a being of 'infinite variety,' and her eyes may sometimes"
9337,NOTE D,"have had, like those of some gipsies, a mysterious gravity or solemnity"
9338,NOTE D,"which would exert a spell more potent than her gaiety. Their colour,"
9339,NOTE D,"presumably, was what is called 'black'; but surely they were not, like"
9340,NOTE D,"those of Tennyson's Cleopatra, '_bold_ black eyes.' Readers interested"
9341,NOTE D,in seeing what criticism is capable of may like to know that it has been
9342,NOTE D,"proposed to read, for the first line of the quotation above, 'O this"
9343,NOTE D,false fowl of Egypt! haggard charmer.' [Though I have not cancelled this
9344,NOTE D,"note I have modified some phrases in it, as I have not much confidence"
9345,NOTE D,"in my suggestion, and am inclined to think that Steevens was right.]"

9389,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9390,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Such phrases as 'Shakespeare the man' or 'Shakespeare's personality'
9391,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"are, no doubt, open to objection. They seem to suggest that, if we could"
9392,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"subtract from Shakespeare the mind that produced his works, the residue"
9393,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,would be the man himself; and that his mind was some pure impersonal
9394,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"essence unaffected by the accidents of physique, temperament, and"
9395,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"character. If this were so, one could but echo Tennyson's thanksgiving"
9396,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"that we know so little of Shakespeare. But as it is assuredly not so,"
9397,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,and as 'Shakespeare the man' really means the one indivisible
9398,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Shakespeare, regarded for the time from a particular point of view, the"
9399,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,natural desire to know whatever can be known of him is not to be
9400,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,repressed merely because there are people so foolish as to be careless
9401,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,about his works and yet curious about his private life. For my own part
9402,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"I confess that, though I should care nothing about the man if he had not"
9403,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"written the works, yet, since we possess them, I would rather see and"
9404,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,hear him for five minutes in his proper person than discover a new one.
9405,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,And though we may be content to die without knowing his income or even
9406,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the surname of Mr. W. H., we cannot so easily resign the wish to find"
9407,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the man in his writings, and to form some idea of the disposition, the"
9408,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"likes and dislikes, the character and the attitude towards life, of the"
9409,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,human being who seems to us to have understood best our common human
9410,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,nature.
9411,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9412,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,The answer of course will be that our biographical knowledge of
9413,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Shakespeare is so small, and his writings are so completely dramatic,"
9414,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"that this wish, however natural, is idle. But I cannot think so."
9415,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Doubtless, in trying to form an idea of Shakespeare, we soon reach the"
9416,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,limits of reasonable certainty; and it is also true that the idea we can
9417,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,form without exceeding them is far from being as individual as we could
9418,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"desire. But it is more distinct than is often supposed, and it _is_"
9419,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,reasonably certain; and although we can add to its distinctness only by
9420,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"more or less probable conjectures, they are not mere guesses, they"
9421,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,really have probability in various degrees. On this whole subject there
9422,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"is a tendency at the present time to an extreme scepticism, which"
9423,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,appears to me to be justified neither by the circumstances of the
9424,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,particular case nor by our knowledge of human nature in general.
9425,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9426,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,This scepticism is due in part to the interest excited by Mr. Lee's
9427,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"discussion of the Sonnets in his _Life_ of Shakespeare, and to the"
9428,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,importance rightly attached to that discussion. The Sonnets are lyrical
9429,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,poems of friendship and love. In them the poet ostensibly speaks in his
9430,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"own person and expresses his own feelings. Many critics, no doubt, had"
9431,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"denied that he really did so; but they had not Mr. Lee's knowledge, nor"
9432,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,had they examined the matter so narrowly as he; and therefore they had
9433,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"not much weakened the general belief that the Sonnets, however"
9434,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"conventional or exaggerated their language may sometimes be, do tell us"
9435,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"a good deal about their author. Mr. Lee, however, showed far more fully"
9436,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"than any previous writer that many of the themes, many even of the"
9437,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"ideas, of these poems are commonplaces of Renaissance sonnet-writing;"
9438,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,and he came to the conclusion that in the Sonnets Shakespeare
9439,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"'unlocked,' not 'his heart,' but a very different kind of armoury, and"
9440,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,that the sole biographical inference deducible from them is that 'at one
9441,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,time in his career Shakespeare disdained no weapon of flattery in an
9442,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,endeavour to monopolise the bountiful patronage of a young man of rank.'
9443,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Now, if that inference is correct, it certainly tells us something about"
9444,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Shakespeare the man; but it also forbids us to take seriously what the
9445,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Sonnets profess to tell us of his passionate affection, with its hopes"
9446,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and fears, its pain and joy; of his pride and his humility, his"
9447,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"self-reproach and self-defence, his weariness of life and his"
9448,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"consciousness of immortal genius. And as, according to Mr. Lee's"
9449,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"statement, the Sonnets alone of Shakespeare's works 'can be held to"
9450,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"throw any illumination on a personal trait,' it seems to follow that, so"
9451,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,far as the works are concerned (for Mr. Lee is not specially sceptical
9452,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"as to the external testimony), the only idea we can form of the man is"
9453,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,contained in that single inference.
9454,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9455,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Now, I venture to surmise that Mr. Lee's words go rather beyond his"
9456,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"meaning. But that is not our business here, nor could a brief discussion"
9457,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,do justice to a theory to which those who disagree with it are still
9458,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,greatly indebted. What I wish to deny is the presupposition which seems
9459,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,to be frequently accepted as an obvious truth. Even if Mr. Lee's view of
9460,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the Sonnets were indisputably correct, nay, if even, to go much further,"
9461,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,the persons and the story in the Sonnets were as purely fictitious as
9462,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"those of _Twelfth Night_, they might and would still tell us something"
9463,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,of the personality of their author. For however free a poet may be from
9464,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the emotions which he simulates, and however little involved in the"
9465,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"conditions which he imagines, he cannot (unless he is a mere copyist)"
9466,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,write a hundred and fifty lyrics expressive of those simulated emotions
9467,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"without disclosing something of himself, something of the way in which"
9468,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,he in particular _would_ feel and behave under the imagined conditions.
9469,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,And the same thing holds in principle of the dramas. Is it really
9470,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"conceivable that a man can write some five and thirty dramas, and"
9471,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"portray in them an enormous amount and variety of human nature, without"
9472,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,betraying anything whatever of his own disposition and preferences? I do
9473,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"not believe that he could do this, even if he deliberately set himself"
9474,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,to the task. The only question is how much of himself he would betray.
9475,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9476,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"One is entitled to say this, I think, on general grounds; but we may"
9477,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,appeal further to specific experience. Of many poets and novelists we
9478,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,know a good deal from external sources. And in these cases we find that
9479,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the man so known to us appears also in his works, and that these by"
9480,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"themselves would have left on us a personal impression which, though"
9481,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"imperfect and perhaps in this or that point even false, would have been"
9482,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,broadly true. Of course this holds of some writers much more fully than
9483,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"of others; but, except where the work is very scanty in amount, it seems"
9484,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"to hold in some degree of all.[1] If so, there is an antecedent"
9485,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"probability that it will apply to Shakespeare too. After all, he was"
9486,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,human. We may exclaim in our astonishment that he was as universal and
9487,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,impartial as nature herself; but this is the language of religious
9488,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,rapture. If we assume that he was six times as universal as Sir Walter
9489,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Scott, which is praise enough for a mortal, we may hope to form an idea"
9490,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,of him from his plays only six times as dim as the idea of Scott that we
9491,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,should derive from the Waverley Novels.
9492,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9493,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"And this is not all. As a matter of fact, the great majority of"
9494,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Shakespeare's readers--lovers of poetry untroubled by theories and
9495,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,questions--do form from the plays some idea of the man. Knowingly or
9496,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"not, they possess such an idea; and up to a certain point the idea is"
9497,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,the same. Ask such a man whether he thinks Shakespeare was at all like
9498,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Shelley, or Wordsworth, or Milton, and it will not occur to him to"
9499,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,answer 'I have not the faintest notion'; he will answer unhesitatingly
9500,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,No. Ask him whether he supposes that Shakespeare was at all like
9501,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Fielding or Scott, and he will probably be found to imagine that, while"
9502,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"differing greatly from both, he did belong to the same type or class."
9503,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"And such answers unquestionably imply an idea which, however deficient"
9504,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"in detail, is definite."
9505,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9506,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Again, to go a little further in the same direction, take this fact."
9507,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"After I had put together my notes for the present lecture, I re-read"
9508,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Bagehot's essay on Shakespeare the Man, and I read a book by Goldwin"
9509,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Smith and an essay by Leslie Stephen (who, I found, had anticipated a"
9510,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"good deal that I meant to say).[2] These three writers, with all their"
9511,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"variety, have still substantially the same idea of Shakespeare; and it"
9512,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,is the idea of the competent 'general reader' more fully developed. Nor
9513,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,is the value of their agreement in the least diminished by the fact that
9514,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,they make no claim to be Shakespeare scholars. They show themselves much
9515,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"abler than most scholars, and if they lack the scholar's knowledge they"
9516,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,are free from his defects. When they wrote their essays they had not
9517,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"wearied themselves with rival hypotheses, or pored over minutiae until"
9518,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,they lost the broad and deep impressions which vivid reading leaves.
9519,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Ultra-scepticism in this matter does not arise merely or mainly from the
9520,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,humility which every man of sense must feel as he creeps to and fro in
9521,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Shakespeare's prodigious mind. It belongs either to the clever faddist
9522,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"who can see nothing straight, or it proceeds from those dangers and"
9523,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,infirmities which the expert in any subject knows too well.
9524,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9525,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,The remarks I am going to make can have an interest only for those who
9526,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,share the position I have tried to indicate; who believe that the most
9527,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"dramatic of writers must reveal in his writings something of himself,"
9528,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,but who recognise that in Shakespeare's case we can expect a reasonable
9529,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"certainty only within narrow limits, while beyond them we have to trust"
9530,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"to impressions, the value of which must depend on familiarity with his"
9531,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"writings, on freedom from prejudice and the desire to reach any"
9532,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"particular result, and on the amount of perception we may happen to"
9533,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"possess. I offer my own impressions, insecure and utterly unprovable as"
9534,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"I know them to be, simply because those of other readers have an"
9535,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"interest for me; and I offer them for the most part without argument,"
9536,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,because even where argument might be useful it requires more time than a
9537,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"lecture can afford. For the same reason I shall assume, without"
9538,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"attempting to define it further, and without dilating on its"
9539,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"implications, the truth of that general feeling about Shakespeare and"
9540,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Fielding and Scott.
9541,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9542,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"But, before we come to impressions at all, we must look at the scanty"
9543,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,store of external evidence: for we may lay down at once the canon that
9544,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,impressions derived from the works must supplement and not contradict
9545,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"this evidence, so far as it appears trustworthy. It is scanty, but it"
9546,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,yields a decided outline.
9547,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9548,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"This figure that thou here seest put,"
9549,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,It was for gentle Shakespeare cut:
9550,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9551,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"--so Jonson writes of the portrait in the Folio, and the same adjective"
9552,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,'gentle' is used elsewhere of Shakespeare. It had not in Elizabethan
9553,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"English so confined a meaning as it has now; but it meant something, and"
9554,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,I do not remember that their contemporaries called Marlowe or Jonson or
9555,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Marston 'gentle.' Next, in the earliest extant reference that we have to"
9556,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Shakespeare, the writer says that he himself has seen his 'demeanour' to"
9557,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,be 'civil.'[3] It is not saying much; but it is not the first remark an
9558,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,acquaintance would probably have made about Ben Jonson or Samuel
9559,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Johnson. The same witness adds about Shakespeare that 'divers of worship
9560,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,have reported his uprightness of dealing which argues his honesty.'
9561,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,'Honesty' and 'honest' in an Elizabethan passage like this mean more
9562,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,than they would now; they answer rather to our 'honourable' or 'honour.'
9563,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Lastly we have the witness borne by Jonson in the words: 'I loved the
9564,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"man, and do honour his memory, on this side idolatry, as much as any. He"
9565,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"was, indeed, honest, and of an open and free nature.' With this notable"
9566,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"phrase, to which I shall have to return, we come to an end of the"
9567,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,testimony of eye-witnesses to Shakespeare the Man (for we have nothing
9568,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"to do with references to the mere actor or author). It is scanty, and"
9569,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"insufficient to discriminate him from other persons who were gentle,"
9570,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"civil, upright in their dealings, honourable, open, and free: but I"
9571,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,submit that there have been not a few writers to whom all these
9572,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"qualities could not be truly ascribed, and that the testimony therefore"
9573,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,does tell us something definite. To which must be added that we have
9574,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,absolutely no evidence which conflicts with it. Whatever Greene in his
9575,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"jealous embitterment might have said would carry little weight, but in"
9576,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"fact, apart from general abuse of actors, he only says that the upstart"
9577,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,had an over-weening opinion of his own capacities.
9578,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9579,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,There remain certain traditions and certain facts; and without
9580,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,discussing them I will mention what seems to me to have a more or less
9581,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,probable significance. Stratford stories of drinking bouts may go for
9582,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"nothing, but not the consensus of tradition to the effect that"
9583,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Shakespeare was a pleasant and convivial person, 'very good company, and"
9584,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,of a very ready and pleasant smooth wit.'[4] That after his retirement
9585,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"to Stratford he spent at the rate of £1000 a year is incredible, but"
9586,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,that he spent freely seems likely enough. The tradition that as a young
9587,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,man he got into trouble with Sir Thomas Lucy for deer-stealing (which
9588,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,would probably be an escapade rather than an essay in serious poaching)
9589,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,is supported by his unsavoury jest about the 'luces' in Sir Robert
9590,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Shallow's coat. The more general statement that in youth he was wild
9591,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"does not sound improbable; and, obscure as the matter is, I cannot"
9592,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,regard as comfortable the little we know of the circumstances of his
9593,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,very early marriage. A contemporary story of an amorous adventure in
9594,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"London may well be pure invention, but we have no reason to reject it"
9595,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"peremptorily as we should any similar gossip about Milton. Lastly,"
9596,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"certain inferences may safely be drawn from the facts that, once"
9597,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"securely started in London, Shakespeare soon began to prosper, and"
9598,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"acquired, for an actor and playwright, considerable wealth; that he"
9599,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"bought property in his native town, and was consulted sometimes by"
9600,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,fellow-townsmen on matters of business; that he enforced the payment of
9601,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,certain debts; and that he took the trouble to get a coat of arms. But
9602,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"what cannot with any logic or any safety be inferred is that he, any"
9603,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"more than Scott, was impelled to write simply and solely by the desire"
9604,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,to make money and improve his social position; and the comparative
9605,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,abundance of business records will mislead only those who are
9606,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"thoughtless enough to forget that, if they buy a house or sue a debtor,"
9607,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the fact will be handed down, while their kind or generous deeds may be"
9608,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"recorded, if at all, only in the statement that they were 'of an open"
9609,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,and free nature.'
9610,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9611,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"That Shakespeare was a good and perhaps keen man of business, or that he"
9612,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"set store by a coat of arms, we could not have inferred from his"
9613,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"writings. But we could have judged from them that he worked hard, and"
9614,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,have guessed with some probability that he would rather have been a
9615,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,'gentleman' than an actor. And most of the other characteristics that
9616,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"appear from the external evidence would, I think, have seemed probable"
9617,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,from a study of the works. This should encourage us to hope that we may
9618,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,be right in other impressions which we receive from them. And we may
9619,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,begin with one on which the external evidence has a certain bearing.
9620,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9621,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Readers of Shakespeare, I believe, imagine him to have been not only"
9622,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,sweet-tempered but modest and unassuming. I do not doubt that they are
9623,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"right; and, vague as the Folio portrait and the Stratford bust are, it"
9624,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"would be difficult to believe that their subject was an irritable,"
9625,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"boastful, or pushing person. But if we confine ourselves to the works,"
9626,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,it is not easy to give reasons for the idea that their author was modest
9627,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and unassuming; and a man is not necessarily so because he is open,"
9628,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"free, and very good company. Perhaps we feel that a man who was not so"
9629,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,would have allowed much more of himself to appear in his works than
9630,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Shakespeare does. Perhaps again we think that anything like presumption
9631,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,or self-importance was incompatible with Shakespeare's sense of the
9632,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"ridiculous, his sublime common-sense, and his feeling of man's"
9633,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"insignificance. And, lastly, it seems to us clear that the playwright"
9634,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"admires and likes people who are modest, unassuming, and plain; while it"
9635,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,may perhaps safely be said that those who lack these qualities rarely
9636,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"admire them in others and not seldom despise them. But, however we may"
9637,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"justify our impression that Shakespeare possessed them, we certainly"
9638,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,receive it; and assuming it to be as correct as the similar impression
9639,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"left by the Waverley Novels indubitably is, I go on to observe that the"
9640,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"possession of them does not of necessity imply a want of spirit, or of"
9641,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"proper self-assertion or insistence on rights.[5] It did not in Scott,"
9642,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and we have ground for saying that it did not in Shakespeare. If it had,"
9643,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"he could not, being of an open and free nature, have prospered as he"
9644,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"prospered. He took offence at Greene's attack on him, and showed that he"
9645,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"took it. He was 'gentle,' but he liked his debts to be paid. However his"
9646,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"attitude as to the enclosure at Welcombe may be construed, it is clear"
9647,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,that he had to be reckoned with. It appears probable that he held
9648,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"himself wronged by Sir Thomas Lucy, and, pocketing up the injury because"
9649,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"he could not resent it, gave him tit for tat after some fifteen years."
9650,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"The man in the Sonnets forgives his friend easily, but it is not from"
9651,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,humility; and towards the world he is very far from humble. Of the
9652,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"dedication of _The Rape of Lucrece_ we cannot judge, for we do not know"
9653,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Shakespeare's relations with Lord Southampton at that date; but, as for"
9654,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the dedication of _Venus and Adonis_, could modesty and dignity be"
9655,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,better mingled in a letter from a young poet to a great noble than they
9656,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,are there?
9657,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9658,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Some of Shakespeare's writings point to a strain of deep reflection and
9659,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,of quasi-metaphysical imagination in his nature; and a few of them seem
9660,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"to reveal a melancholy, at times merely sad, at times embittered or"
9661,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"profound, if never hopeless. It is on this side mainly that we feel a"
9662,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"decided difference between him and Fielding, and even between him and"
9663,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Scott. Yet nothing in the contemporary allusions or in the traditions
9664,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"would suggest that he was notably thoughtful or serious, and much less"
9665,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,that he was melancholy. And although we could lay no stress on this fact
9666,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"if it stood alone, it is probably significant. Shakespeare's writings,"
9667,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"on the whole, leave a strong impression that his native disposition was"
9668,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,much more gay than grave. They seem always to have made this impression.
9669,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Fuller tells us that 'though his genius generally was jocular and
9670,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"inclining him to festivity, yet he could, when so disposed, be solemn"
9671,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and serious, as appears by his tragedies.'[6] Johnson agreed with Rymer"
9672,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"that his 'natural disposition' led him to comedy; and, although Johnson"
9673,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,after his manner distorts a true idea by wilful exaggeration and by
9674,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"perverting distinctions into antitheses, there is truth in his"
9675,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,development of Rymer's remark. It would be easy to quote nineteenth
9676,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,century critics to the same effect; and the study of Shakespeare's early
9677,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,works leads to a similar result. It has been truly said that we feel
9678,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,ourselves in much closer contact with his personality in the early
9679,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,comedies and in _Romeo and Juliet_ than in _Henry VI._ and _Richard
9680,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"III._ and _Titus Andronicus_. In the latter, so far as we suppose them"
9681,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"to be his own, he seems on the whole to be following, and then improving"
9682,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"on, an existing style, and to be dealing with subjects which engage him"
9683,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,as a playwright without much appealing to him personally. With _Romeo
9684,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and Juliet_, on the other hand, and with _Richard II._ (which seems"
9685,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,clearly to be his first attempt to write historical tragedy in a manner
9686,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"entirely his own), it is different, and we feel the presence of the"
9687,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"whole man. The stories are tragic, but it is not precisely the _tragic_"
9688,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"aspect of them that attracts him most; and even Johnson's statement,"
9689,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"grotesquely false of the later tragedies, that 'in tragedy he is always"
9690,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"struggling after some occasion to be comic,' is no more than an"
9691,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"exaggeration in respect to _Romeo and Juliet_.[7] From these tragedies,"
9692,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"as from _Love's Labour's Lost_ and the other early comedies, we should"
9693,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"guess that the author was a young man, happy, alert, light-hearted, full"
9694,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"of romance and poetry, but full also of fun; blessed with a keen"
9695,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"enjoyment of absurdities, but, for all his intellectual subtlety and"
9696,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"power, not markedly reflective, and certainly not particularly grave or"
9697,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"much inclined to dejection. One might even suspect, I venture to think,"
9698,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,that with such a flow of spirits and such exceeding alacrity of mind he
9699,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,might at present be a trifle wanting in feeling and disposed to levity.
9700,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"In any case, if our general impression is correct, we shall not find it"
9701,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,hard to believe that the author of these plays and the creator of
9702,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Falstaff was 'very good company' and a convivial good-fellow; and it
9703,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,might easily happen that he was tempted at times to 'go here and there'
9704,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"in society, and 'make himself a motley to the view' in a fashion that"
9705,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,left some qualms behind.[8]
9706,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9707,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,There is a tradition that Shakespeare was 'a handsome well-shaped man.'
9708,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"If the Stratford monument does not lie, he was not in later life a"
9709,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"meagre man. And if our notion of his temperament has any truth, he can"
9710,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"hardly have been physically feeble, bloodless, or inactive. Most readers"
9711,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,probably imagine him the reverse. Even sceptical critics tell us that he
9712,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,was fond of field-sports; and of his familiar knowledge of them there
9713,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,can be no question. Yet--I can but record the impression without trying
9714,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,to justify it--his writings do not at all suggest to me that he was a
9715,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"splendidly powerful creature like Fielding, or that he greatly enjoyed"
9716,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"bodily exertion, or was not easily tired. He says much of horses, but he"
9717,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"does not make one think, as Scott does, that a gallop was a great"
9718,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,delight to him. Nor again do I feel after reading him that he had a
9719,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"strong natural love of adventurous deeds, or longed to be an explorer or"
9720,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,a soldier. The island of his boyish dreams--if he heard much of voyages
9721,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"as a boy--was, I fancy, the haunt of marmosets and hedgehogs, quaint"
9722,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"moon-calves and flitting sprites, lovely colours, sounds and sweet airs"
9723,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"that give delight and hurt not, less like Treasure Island than the Coral"
9724,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Island of Ballantyne in the original illustrations, and more full of"
9725,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,wonders than of dangers. He would have liked the Arabian Nights better
9726,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"than Dumas. Of course he admired men of action, understood them, and"
9727,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,could express their feelings; but we do not feel particularly close to
9728,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"his personality as we read the warrior speeches of Hotspur, Henry,"
9729,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Othello, Coriolanus, as we do when we read of Romeo or Hamlet, or when"
9730,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"we feel the attraction of Henry's modesty. In the same way, I suppose"
9731,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,nobody feels Shakespeare's personal presence in the ambition of Macbeth
9732,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,or the pride of Coriolanus; many feel it in Macbeth's imaginative
9733,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"terrors, and in the disgust of Coriolanus at the idea of recounting his"
9734,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,exploits in order to win votes. When we seem to hear Shakespeare's
9735,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,voice--and we hear it from many mouths besides Romeo's or Hamlet's--it
9736,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"is the voice of a man with a happy, enjoying, but still contemplative"
9737,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and even dreamy nature, not of a man richly endowed with the impulses"
9738,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,and feelings either of strenuous action or of self-assertion. If he had
9739,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"drawn a Satan, we should not have felt his personality, as we do"
9740,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Milton's, in Satan's pride and indomitable courage and intolerance of"
9741,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,rule.
9742,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9743,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"We know how often Shakespeare uses the antithesis of blood or passion,"
9744,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and judgment or reason; how he praises the due commingling of the two,"
9745,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,or the control of the first by the second; how frequently it is the want
9746,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,of such control that exposes his heroes to the attack of Fortune or
9747,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Fate. What, then, were the passions or the 'affections of the blood'"
9748,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"most dangerous to himself? Not, if we have been right, those of pride or"
9749,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"ambition; nor yet those of envy, hatred, or revenge; and still less that"
9750,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"of avarice. But, in the first place, let us remember Jonson's words, 'he"
9751,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"was honest and of an open and free nature,' and let me repeat an"
9752,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"observation, made elsewhere in passing, that these words are true also"
9753,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"of the great majority of Shakespeare's heroes, and not least of his"
9754,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,tragic heroes. Jonson almost quotes Iago:
9755,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9756,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"The Moor is of a free and open nature,"
9757,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,That thinks men honest that but seem to be so.
9758,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9759,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"The king says that Hamlet,"
9760,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9761,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"being remiss,"
9762,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Most generous, and free from all contrivings,"
9763,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Will not peruse the foils.
9764,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9765,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"The words 'open and free' apply no less eminently to Brutus, Lear, and"
9766,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Timon. Antony and Coriolanus are men naturally frank, liberal, and"
9767,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,large. Prospero lost his dukedom through his trustfulness. Romeo and
9768,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Troilus and Orlando, and many slighter characters, are so far of the"
9769,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"same type. Now such a free and open nature, obviously, is specially"
9770,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"exposed to the risks of deception, perfidy, and ingratitude. If it is"
9771,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"also a nature sensitive and intense, but not particularly active or (if"
9772,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the word may be excused) volitional, such experiences will tempt it to"
9773,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"melancholy, embitterment, anger, possibly even misanthropy. If it _is_"
9774,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"thus active or volitional, it may become the prey of violent and"
9775,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"destructive passion, such as that of Othello and of Coriolanus, and such"
9776,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"as Lear's would be if he were not so old. These affections, passions,"
9777,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,and sufferings of free and open natures are Shakespeare's favourite
9778,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"tragic subject; and his favouritism, surely, goes so far as to"
9779,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"constitute a decided peculiarity, not found thus in other tragic poets."
9780,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Here he painted most, one cannot but think, what his own nature was most"
9781,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"inclined to feel. But it would rather be melancholy, embitterment, an"
9782,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"inactive rage or misanthropy, than any destructive passion; and it would"
9783,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"be a further question whether, and how far, he may at any time have"
9784,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,experienced what he depicts. I am speaking here only of his
9785,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,disposition.[9]
9786,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9787,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,That Shakespeare was as much inclined to be a lover as most poets we may
9788,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,perhaps safely assume; but can we conjecture anything further on this
9789,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,subject? I will confine myself to two points. He treats of love
9790,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"romantically, and tragically, and humorously. In the earlier plays"
9791,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"especially the humorous aspect of the matter, the aspect so prominent in"
9792,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the _Midsummer-Night's Dream_, the changefulness, brevity,"
9793,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"irrationality, of the feeling, is at least as much dwelt on as the"
9794,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"romantic, and with at least as much relish:"
9795,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9796,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Lord! what fools these mortals be!
9797,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9798,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Now, if there is anything peculiar in the pictures here, it is, perhaps,"
9799,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,the special interest that Shakespeare seems to take in what we may call
9800,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,the unreality of the feeling of love in an imaginative nature. Romeo as
9801,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"he first appears, and, in a later play, Orsino, are examples of this."
9802,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"They are perfectly sincere, of course, but neither of them is really in"
9803,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,love with a woman; each is in love with the state of being in love. This
9804,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"state is able to attach itself to a particular object, but it is not"
9805,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,induced by the particular qualities of that object; it is more a dream
9806,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"than a passion, and can melt away without carrying any of the lover's"
9807,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"heart with it; and in that sense it is unreal. This weakness, no doubt,"
9808,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"is not confined to imaginative natures, but they may well be specially"
9809,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"disposed to it (as Shelley was), and Shakespeare may have drawn it from"
9810,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,his own experience. The suspicion is strengthened when we think of
9811,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"_Richard II_. In Richard this imaginative weakness is exhibited again,"
9812,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,though not in relation to love. He luxuriates in images of his royal
9813,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"majesty, of the angels who guard his divine right, and of his own"
9814,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"pathetic and almost sacred sufferings. The images are not insincere, and"
9815,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"yet they are like dreams, for they refuse to touch earth and to connect"
9816,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,themselves either with his past misdeeds or with the actions he ought
9817,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"now to perform. A strain of a similar weakness appears again in Hamlet,"
9818,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,though only as one strain in a much more deep and complex nature. But
9819,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"this is not a common theme in poetry, much less in dramatic poetry.[10]"
9820,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9821,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,To come to our second question. When Shakespeare painted Cressida or
9822,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"described her through the mouth of Ulysses ('O these encounterers,'"
9823,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"etc.), or, again, when he portrayed the love of Antony for Cleopatra,"
9824,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,was he using his personal experience? To answer that he _must_ have done
9825,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,so would be as ridiculous as to argue that Iago must be a portrait of
9826,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"himself; and the two plays contain nothing which, by itself, would"
9827,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,justify us even in thinking that he probably did so. But we have the
9828,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,series of sonnets about the dark lady; and if we accept the sonnets to
9829,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,the friend as to some considerable extent based on fact and expressive
9830,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"of personal feelings, how can we refuse to take the others on the same"
9831,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"footing? Even if the stories of the two series were not intertwined, we"
9832,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"should have no ground for treating the two in different ways, unless we"
9833,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"could say that external evidence, or the general impression we derive"
9834,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"from Shakespeare's works, forbids us to believe that he could ever have"
9835,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"been entangled in an intrigue like that implied in the second series, or"
9836,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,have felt and thought in the manner there portrayed. Being unable to say
9837,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"this, I am compelled, most regretfully, to hold it probable that this"
9838,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"series is, in the main, based on personal experience. And I say 'most"
9839,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"regretfully,' not merely because one would regret to think that"
9840,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Shakespeare was the victim of a Cressida or even the lover of a
9841,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Cleopatra, but because the story implied in these sonnets is of quite"
9842,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"another kind. They leave, on the whole, a very disagreeable impression."
9843,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"We cannot compare it with the impressions produced, for example, by the"
9844,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"'heathen' spirit of Goethe's _Roman Elegies_, or by the passion of"
9845,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Shakespeare's Antony. In these two cases, widely dissimilar of course,"
9846,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"we may speak of 'immorality,' but we are not discomfited, much less"
9847,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"disgusted. The feeling and the attitude are poetic, whole-hearted, and"
9848,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,in one case passionate in the extreme. But the state of mind expressed
9849,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"in the sonnets about the dark lady is half-hearted, often prosaic, and"
9850,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"never worthy of the name of passion. It is uneasy, dissatisfied,"
9851,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"distempered, the state of mind of a man who despises his 'passion' and"
9852,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"its object and himself, but, standing intellectually far above it, still"
9853,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"has not resolution to end it, and only pains us by his gross and joyless"
9854,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,jests. In _Troilus and Cressida_--not at all in the portrayal of
9855,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Troilus's love, but in the atmosphere of the drama--we seem to trace a"
9856,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"similar mood of dissatisfaction, and of intellectual but practically"
9857,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,impotent contempt.
9858,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9859,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,In this connection it is natural to think of the 'unhappy period' which
9860,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,has so often been surmised in Shakespeare's life. There is not time here
9861,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,to expand the summary remarks made elsewhere on this subject; but I may
9862,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,refer a little more fully to a persistent impression left on my mind by
9863,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,writings which we have reason to assign to the years 1602-6.[11] There
9864,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,is surely something unusual in their tone regarding certain 'vices of
9865,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the blood,' regarding drunkenness and sexual corruption. It does not lie"
9866,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"in Shakespeare's _view_ of these vices, but in an undertone of disgust."
9867,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Read Hamlet's language about the habitual drunkenness of his uncle, or"
9868,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,even Cassio's words about his casual excess; then think of the tone of
9869,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,_Henry IV._ or _Twelfth Night_ or the _Tempest_; and ask if the
9870,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,difference is not striking. And if you are inclined to ascribe it wholly
9871,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"to the fact that _Hamlet_ and _Othello_ are tragedies, compare the"
9872,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,passages in them with the scene on Pompey's galley in _Antony and
9873,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Cleopatra_. The intent of that scene is terrible enough, but in the tone"
9874,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,there is no more trace of disgust than in _Twelfth Night_. As to the
9875,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"other matter, what I refer to is not the transgression of lovers like"
9876,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Claudio and Juliet, nor even light-hearted irregularities like those of"
9877,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Cassio: here Shakespeare's speech has its habitual tone. But, when he is"
9878,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"dealing with lechery and corruption, the undercurrent of disgust seems"
9879,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,to become audible. Is it not true that in the plays from _Hamlet_ to
9880,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"_Timon_ that subject, in one shape or another, is continually before us;"
9881,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,that the intensity of loathing in Hamlet's language about his mother's
9882,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,lust is unexampled in Shakespeare; that the treatment of the subject in
9883,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"_Measure for Measure_, though occasionally purely humorous, is on the"
9884,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,whole quite unlike the treatment in _Henry IV._ or even in the brothel
9885,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,scenes of _Pericles_;[12] that while _Troilus and Cressida_ is full of
9886,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"disgust and contempt, there is not a trace of either in _Antony and"
9887,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Cleopatra_, though some of the jesting there is obscene enough; that"
9888,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,this same tone is as plainly heard in the unquestioned parts of _Timon_;
9889,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and that, while it is natural in Timon to inveigh against female lechery"
9890,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"when he speaks to Alcibiades and his harlots, there is no apparent"
9891,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,reason why Lear in his exalted madness should choose this subject for
9892,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"similar invectives? 'Pah! give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to"
9893,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,sweeten my imagination'--it is a fainter echo of this exclamation that
9894,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,one seems to hear in the plays of those years. Of course I am not
9895,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"suggesting that it is mainly due, or as regards drunkenness due in the"
9896,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"least, to any private experience of Shakespeare's. It may have no"
9897,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,connection whatever with that experience. It might well be connected
9898,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,with it only in so far as a man frequently wearied and depressed might
9899,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"be unusually sensitive to the ugly aspects of life. But, if we do not"
9900,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"take the second series of sonnets to be purely fanciful, we shall think"
9901,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,it probable that to some undefined extent it owed its origin to the
9902,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,experience depicted in them.[13]
9903,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9904,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,There remain the sonnets addressed to the friend. Even if it were
9905,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"possible to discuss the general question about them here, it would be"
9906,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"needless; for I accept almost wholly, and in some points am greatly"
9907,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"indebted to, the views put forward by Mr. Beeching in his admirable"
9908,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"edition, to which I may therefore refer my hearers.[14] I intend only to"
9909,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"state the main reason why I believe the sonnets to be, substantially,"
9910,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"what they purport to be, and then to touch upon one or two of the points"
9911,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,where they seem to throw light on Shakespeare's personality.
9912,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9913,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"The sonnets to the friend are, so far as we know, unique in Renaissance"
9914,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,sonnet literature in being a prolonged and varied record of the intense
9915,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"affection of an older friend for a younger, and of other feelings"
9916,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,arising from their relations. They have no real parallel in any series
9917,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"imitative of Virgil's second Eclogue, or in occasional sonnets to"
9918,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,patrons or patron-friends couched in the high-flown language of the
9919,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"time. The intensity of the feelings expressed, however, ought not, by"
9920,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"itself, to convince us that they are personal. The author of the plays"
9921,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"could, I make no doubt, have written the most intimate of these poems to"
9922,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,a mere creature of his imagination and without ever having felt them
9923,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,except in imagination. Nor is there any but an aesthetic reason why he
9924,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,should not have done so if he had wished. But an aesthetic reason there
9925,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"is; and this is the decisive point. No capable poet, much less a"
9926,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Shakespeare, intending to produce a merely 'dramatic' series of poems,"
9927,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"would dream of inventing a story like that of these sonnets, or, even if"
9928,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"he did, of treating it as they treat it. The story is very odd and"
9929,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,unattractive. Such capacities as it has are but slightly developed. It
9930,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"is left obscure, and some of the poems are unintelligible to us because"
9931,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,they contain allusions of which we can make nothing. Now all this is
9932,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,perfectly natural if the story is substantially a real story of
9933,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Shakespeare himself and of certain other persons; if the sonnets were
9934,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"written from time to time as the relations of the persons changed, and"
9935,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,sometimes in reference to particular incidents; and if they were written
9936,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,_for_ one or more of these persons (far the greater number for only
9937,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"one), and perhaps in a few cases for other friends,--written, that is to"
9938,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"say, for people who knew the details and incidents of which we are"
9939,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"ignorant. But it is all unnatural, well-nigh incredibly unnatural, if,"
9940,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"with the most sceptical critics, we regard the sonnets as a free product"
9941,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,of mere imagination.[15]
9942,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9943,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Assuming, then, that the persons of the story, with their relations, are"
9944,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"real, I would add only two remarks about the friend. In the first place,"
9945,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Mr. Beeching seems to me right in denying that there is sufficient
9946,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,evidence of his standing to Shakespeare and the 'rival' poet or poets in
9947,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the position of a literary patron; while, even if he did, it appears to"
9948,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,me quite impossible to take the language of many of the sonnets as that
9949,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,of interested flattery. And in the second place I should be inclined to
9950,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,push even further Mr. Beeching's view on another point. It is clear that
9951,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,the young man was considerably superior to the actor-dramatist in social
9952,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"position; but any gentleman would be so, and there is nothing to prove"
9953,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"that he was more than a gentleman of some note, more than plain 'Mr. W."
9954,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"H.' (for these, on the obvious though not compulsory interpretation of"
9955,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the dedication, seem to have been his initials). It is remarkable"
9956,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"besides that, while the earlier sonnets show much deference, the later"
9957,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"show very little, so little that, when the writer, finding that he has"
9958,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"pained his young friend by neglecting him, begs to be forgiven, he"
9959,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"writes almost, if not quite, as an equal. Read, for example, sonnets"
9960,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"109, 110, 120, and ask whether it is probable that Shakespeare is"
9961,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,addressing here a great nobleman. It seems therefore most likely (though
9962,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the question is not of much importance) that the sonnets are, to quote"
9963,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Meres's phrase,[16] his 'sonnets among his private friends.'"
9964,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
9965,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"If then there is, as it appears, no obstacle of any magnitude to our"
9966,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"taking the sonnets as substantially what they purport to be, we may"
9967,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"naturally look in them for personal traits (and, indeed, to repeat a"
9968,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"remark made earlier, we might still expect to find such traits even if"
9969,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,we knew the sonnets to be purely dramatic). But in drawing inferences we
9970,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,have to bear in mind what is implied by the qualification
9971,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,'substantially.' We have to remember that _some_ of these poems may be
9972,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"mere exercises of art; that all of them are poems, and not letters, much"
9973,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,less _affidavits_; that they are Elizabethan poems; that the Elizabethan
9974,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"language of deference, and also of affection, is to our minds habitually"
9975,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,extravagant and fantastic;[17] and that in Elizabethan plays friends
9976,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,openly express their love for one another as Englishmen now rarely do.
9977,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Allowance being made, however, on account of these facts, the sonnets"
9978,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,will still leave two strong impressions--that the poet was exceedingly
9979,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"sensitive to the charm of beauty, and that his love for his friend was,"
9980,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"at least at one time, a feeling amounting almost to adoration, and so"
9981,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,intense as to be absorbing. Those who are surprised by the first of
9982,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,these traits must have read Shakespeare's dramas with very inactive
9983,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"minds, and I must add that they seem to be somewhat ignorant of human"
9984,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"nature. We do not necessarily love best those of our relatives, friends,"
9985,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,and acquaintances who please our eyes most; and we should look askance
9986,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,on anyone who regulated his behaviour chiefly by the standard of beauty;
9987,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"but most of us, I suppose, love any human being, of either sex and of"
9988,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"any age, the better for being beautiful, and are not the least ashamed"
9989,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"of the fact. It is further the case that men who are beginning, like the"
9990,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"writer of the sonnets, to feel tired and old, are apt to feel an"
9991,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,increased and special pleasure in the beauty of the young.[18] If we
9992,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"remember, in addition, what some critics appear constantly to forget,"
9993,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"that Shakespeare was a particularly poetical being, we shall hardly be"
9994,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,surprised that the beginning of this friendship seems to have been
9995,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"something like a falling in love; and, if we must needs praise and"
9996,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"blame, we should also remember that it became a 'marriage of true"
9997,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,minds.'[19] And as to the intensity of the feeling expressed in the
9998,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"sonnets, we can easily believe it to be characteristic of the man who"
9999,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"made Valentine and Proteus, Brutus and Cassius, Horatio and Hamlet; who"
10000,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"painted that strangely moving portrait of Antonio, middle-aged, sad, and"
10001,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"almost indifferent between life and death, but devoted to the young,"
10002,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,brilliant spendthrift Bassanio; and who portrayed the sudden compelling
10003,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,enchantment exercised by the young Sebastian over the Antonio of
10004,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"_Twelfth Night_. 'If you will not murder me for your love, let me be"
10005,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,your servant.' Antonio is accused of piracy: he may lose his life if he
10006,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,is identified:
10007,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10008,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"I have many enemies in Orsino's court,"
10009,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"But, come what may, I do adore thee so"
10010,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"That danger shall seem sport, and I will go."
10011,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10012,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"The adoration, the 'prostration,' of the writer of the sonnets is of one"
10013,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,kind with this.
10014,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10015,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,I do not remember what critic uses the word 'prostration.' It applies to
10016,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Shakespeare's attitude only in some of the sonnets, but there it does"
10017,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"apply, unless it is taken to suggest humiliation. _That_ is the term"
10018,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"used by Hallam, but chiefly in view of a particular point, namely the"
10019,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"failure of the poet to 'resent,' though he 'felt and bewailed,' the"
10020,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,injury done him in 'the seduction of his mistress.' Though I think we
10021,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"should substitute 'resent more strongly' for the mere 'resent,' I do not"
10022,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,deny that the poet's attitude in this matter strikes us at first as
10023,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,surprising as well as unpleasant to contemplate. But Hallam's
10024,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"explanation of it as perhaps due to the exalted position of the friend,"
10025,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,would make it much more than unpleasant; and his language seems to show
10026,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"that he, like many critics, did not fully imagine the situation. It is"
10027,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,not easy to speak of it in public with the requisite frankness; but it
10028,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"is necessary to realise that, whatever the friend's rank might be, he"
10029,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and the poet were intimate friends; that, manifestly, it was rather the"
10030,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,mistress who seduced the friend than the friend the mistress; and that
10031,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"she was apparently a woman not merely of no reputation, but of such a"
10032,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,nature that she might readily be expected to be mistress to two men at
10033,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,one and the same time. Anyone who realises this may call the situation
10034,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"'humiliating' in one sense, and I cannot quarrel with him; but he will"
10035,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,not call it 'humiliating' in respect of Shakespeare's relation to his
10036,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,friend; nor will he wonder much that the poet felt more pain than
10037,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,resentment at his friend's treatment of him. There is something
10038,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"infinitely stranger in a play of Shakespeare's, and it may be"
10039,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,symptomatic. Ten Brink called attention to it. Proteus actually offers
10040,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"violence to Sylvia, a spotless lady and the true love of his friend"
10041,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Valentine; and Valentine not only forgives him at once when he professes
10042,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"repentance, but offers to resign Sylvia to him! The incident is to us so"
10043,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,utterly preposterous that we find it hard to imagine how the audience
10044,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"stood it; but, even if we conjecture that Shakespeare adopted it from"
10045,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the story he was using, we can hardly suppose that it was so absurd to"
10046,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,him as it is to us.[20] And it is not the Sonnets alone which lead us to
10047,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"surmise that forgiveness was particularly attractive to him, and the"
10048,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,forgiveness of a friend much easier than resentment. From the Sonnets we
10049,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,gather--and there is nothing in the plays or elsewhere to contradict the
10050,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"impression--that he would not be slow to resent the criticisms,"
10051,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"slanders, or injuries of strangers or the world, and that he bore"
10052,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"himself towards them with a proud, if silent, self-sufficiency. But, we"
10053,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"surmise, for anyone whom he loved"
10054,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10055,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,He carried anger as a flint bears fire;
10056,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark"
10057,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,And straight is cold again;
10058,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10059,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,and towards anyone so fondly loved as the friend of the Sonnets he was
10060,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,probably incapable of fierce or prolonged resentment.
10061,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10062,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10063,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,The Sonnets must not occupy us further; and I will not dwell on the
10064,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,indications they afford that Shakespeare sometimes felt bitterly both
10065,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the social inferiority of his position as an actor,[21] and its"
10066,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,influence on his own character; or that (as we have already conjectured)
10067,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"he may sometimes have played the fool in society, sometimes felt weary"
10068,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"of life, and often was over-tired by work. It is time to pass on to a"
10069,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,few hesitating conjectures about what may be called his tastes.
10070,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10071,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Some passages of his about music have become household words. It is not
10072,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"downright impossible that, like Bottom, having only a reasonable good"
10073,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"ear, he liked best the tongs and the bones; that he wondered, with"
10074,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Benedick, how sheeps-guts should hale souls out of men's bodies; and"
10075,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,that he wrote the famous lines in the _Merchant of Venice_ and in
10076,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,_Twelfth Night_ from mere observation and imagination. But it is futile
10077,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"to deal with scepticism run well-nigh mad, and certainly inaccessible to"
10078,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,argument from the cases of poets whose tastes are matter of knowledge.
10079,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Assuming therefore that Shakespeare was fond of music, I may draw"
10080,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,attention to two points. Almost always he speaks of music as having a
10081,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"softening, tranquillising, or pensive influence. It lulls killing care"
10082,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and grief of heart to sleep. It soothes the sick and weary, and even"
10083,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,makes them drowsy. Hamlet calls for it in his hysterical excitement
10084,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,after the success of the play scene. When it is hoped that Lear's long
10085,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"sleep will have carried his madness away, music is played as he awakes,"
10086,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,apparently to increase the desired 'temperance.' It harmonises with the
10087,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"still and moon-lit night, and the dreamy happiness of newly-wedded"
10088,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"lovers. Almost all the rare allusions to lively or exciting music,"
10089,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"apart from dancing, refer, I believe, to 'the lofty instruments of"
10090,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,_war_.' These facts would almost certainly have a personal significance
10091,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"if Shakespeare were a more modern poet. Whether they have any, or have"
10092,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"much, in an Elizabethan I do not venture to judge."
10093,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10094,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"The second point is diminutive, but it may be connected with the first."
10095,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,The Duke in _Measure for Measure_ observes that music often has
10096,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10097,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,a charm
10098,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,To make bad good and good provoke to harm.
10099,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10100,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"If we ask how it should provoke good to harm, we may recall what was"
10101,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"said (p. 326) of the weaknesses of some poetic natures, and that no one"
10102,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"speaks more feelingly of music than Orsino; further, how he refers to"
10103,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"music as 'the food of love,' and who it is that almost repeats the"
10104,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,phrase.
10105,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10106,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Give me some music: music, moody food"
10107,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Of us that trade in love:
10108,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10109,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,--the words are Cleopatra's.[22] Did Shakespeare as he wrote them
10110,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"remember, I wonder, the dark lady to whose music he had listened (Sonnet"
10111,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,128)?
10112,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10113,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,We should be greatly surprised to find in Shakespeare signs of the
10114,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"nineteenth century feeling for mountain scenery, but we can no more"
10115,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,doubt that within certain limits he was sensitive to the beauty of
10116,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,nature than that he was fond of music.[23] The only question is whether
10117,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,we can guess at any preferences here. It is probably inevitable that the
10118,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,flowers most often mentioned should be the rose and the lily;[24] but
10119,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"hardly that the violet should come next and not far behind, and that the"
10120,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,fragrance of the violet should be spoken of more often even than that of
10121,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the rose, and, it seems, with special affection. This may be a fancy,"
10122,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and it will be thought a sentimental fancy too; but poets, like other"
10123,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"people, may have favourite flowers; that of Keats, we happen to know,"
10124,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,was the violet.
10125,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10126,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Again, if we may draw any conclusion from the frequency and the"
10127,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"character of the allusions, the lark held for Shakespeare the place of"
10128,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"honour among birds; and the lines,"
10129,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10130,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Hark! hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,"
10131,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"And Phoebus gins arise,"
10132,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10133,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"may suggest one reason for this. The lark, as several other collocations"
10134,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"show, was to him the bird of joy that welcomes the sun; and it can"
10135,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,hardly be doubted that dawn and early morning was the time of day that
10136,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,most appealed to him. That he felt the beauty of night and of moonlight
10137,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"is obvious; but we find very little to match the lines in _Richard II._,"
10138,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10139,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"The setting sun, and music at the close,"
10140,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last;"
10141,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10142,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and still less to prove that he felt the magic of evening twilight, the"
10143,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,'heavenliest hour' of a famous passage in _Don Juan_. There is a
10144,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"wonderful line in Sonnet 132,"
10145,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10146,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"And that full star that ushers in the even,"
10147,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10148,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"but I remember little else of the same kind. Shakespeare, as it happens,"
10149,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"uses the word 'twilight' only once, and in an unforgetable passage:"
10150,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10151,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,In me thou see'st the twilight of such day
10152,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,As after sunset fadeth in the west:
10153,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Which by and by black night doth take away,"
10154,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Death's second self that seals up all in rest.
10155,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10156,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"And this feeling, though not often so solemn, is on the whole the"
10157,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,prevailing sentiment in the references to sunset and evening twilight.
10158,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,It corresponds with the analogy between the times of the day and the
10159,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,periods of human life. The sun sets from the weariness of age; but he
10160,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"rises in the strength and freshness of youth, firing the proud tops of"
10161,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the eastern pines, and turning the hills and the sea into burnished"
10162,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"gold, while jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops, and the"
10163,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,lark sings at the gate of heaven. In almost all the familiar lines about
10164,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,dawn one seems to catch that 'indescribable gusto' which Keats heard in
10165,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Kean's delivery of the words:
10166,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10167,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk."
10168,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10169,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Two suggestions may be ventured as to Shakespeare's feelings towards
10170,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,four-footed animals. The first must be very tentative. We do not expect
10171,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,in a writer of that age the sympathy with animals which is so beautiful
10172,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,a trait in much of the poetry of the last hundred and fifty years. And I
10173,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,can remember in Shakespeare scarcely any sign of _fondness_ for an
10174,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"animal,--not even for a horse, though he wrote so often of horses. But"
10175,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"there are rather frequent, if casual, expressions of pity, in"
10176,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"references, for example, to the hunted hare or stag, or to the spurred"
10177,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,horse:[25] and it may be questioned whether the passage in _As You Like
10178,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,It_ about the wounded deer is quite devoid of personal significance. No
10179,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,doubt Shakespeare thought the tears of Jaques sentimental; but he put a
10180,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"piece of himself into Jaques. And, besides, it is not Jaques alone who"
10181,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"dislikes the killing of the deer, but the Duke; and we may surely hear"
10182,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,some tone of Shakespeare's voice in the Duke's speech about the life in
10183,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the forest. Perhaps we may surmise that, while he enjoyed field-sports,"
10184,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,he felt them at times to be out of tune with the harmony of nature.
10185,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10186,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"On the second point, I regret to say, I can feel no doubt. Shakespeare"
10187,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"did not care for dogs, as Homer did; he even disliked them, as Goethe"
10188,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,did. Of course he can write eloquently about the points of hounds and the
10189,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"music of their voices in the chase, and humorously about Launce's love"
10190,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,for his cur and even about the cur himself; but this is no more
10191,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,significant on the one side than is his conventional use of 'dog' as a
10192,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,term of abuse on the other. What is significant is the absence of
10193,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"allusion, or (to be perfectly accurate) of sympathetic allusion, to the"
10194,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"characteristic virtues of dogs, and the abundance of allusions of an"
10195,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"insulting kind. Shakespeare has observed and recorded, in some instances"
10196,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"profusely, every vice that I can think of in an ill-conditioned dog. He"
10197,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"fawns and cringes and flatters, and then bites the hand that caressed"
10198,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"him; he is a coward who attacks you from behind, and barks at you the"
10199,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"more the farther off you go; he knows neither charity, humanity, nor"
10200,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"gratitude; as he flatters power and wealth, so he takes part against the"
10201,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"poor and unfashionable, and if fortune turns against you so does he.[26]"
10202,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,The plays swarm with these charges. Whately's exclamation--uttered after
10203,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"a College meeting or a meeting of Chapter, I forget which--'The more I"
10204,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"see of men, the more I like dogs,' would never have been echoed by"
10205,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Shakespeare. The things he most loathed in men he found in dogs too. And
10206,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,yet all this might go for nothing if we could set anything of weight
10207,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"against it. But what can we set? Nothing whatever, so far as I remember,"
10208,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"except a recognition of courage in bear-baiting, bull-baiting mastiffs."
10209,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,For I cannot quote as favourable to the spaniel the appeal of Helena:
10210,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10211,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,"
10212,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,The more you beat me I will fawn on you:
10213,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,"
10214,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,"
10215,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Unworthy as I am, to follow you."
10216,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10217,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,This may show that Shakespeare was alive to the baseness of a
10218,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"spaniel-owner, but not that he appreciated that self-less affection"
10219,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"which he describes. It is more probable that it irritated him, as it"
10220,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"does many men still; and, as for its implying fidelity, there is no"
10221,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"reference, I believe, to the fidelity of the dog in the whole of his"
10222,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"works, and he chooses the spaniel himself as a symbol of flattery and"
10223,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,ingratitude: his Cæsar talks of
10224,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10225,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Knee-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning;
10226,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10227,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,his Antony exclaims:
10228,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10229,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,the hearts
10230,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave"
10231,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets"
10232,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,On blossoming Cæsar.
10233,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10234,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,To all that he loved most in men he was blind in dogs. And then we call
10235,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,him universal!
10236,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10237,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,This line of research into Shakespeare's tastes might be pursued a good
10238,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"deal further, but we must return to weightier matters. We saw that he"
10239,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"could sympathise with anyone who erred and suffered from impulse,"
10240,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"affections of the blood, or even such passions as were probably no"
10241,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"danger to himself,--ambition, for instance, and pride. Can we learn"
10242,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,anything more about him by observing virtues or types of character with
10243,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"which he appears to feel little sympathy, though he may approve them? He"
10244,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,certainly does not show this imperfect sympathy towards self-control; we
10245,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"seem to feel even a special liking for Brutus, and again for Horatio,"
10246,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"who has suffered much, is quietly patient, and has mastered both himself"
10247,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and fortune. But, not to speak of coldly selfish natures, he seems"
10248,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"averse to bloodless people, those who lack, or those who have deadened,"
10249,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the natural desires for joy and sympathy, and those who tend to be"
10250,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"precise.[27] Nor does he appear to be drawn to men who, as we say, try"
10251,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,to live or to act on principle; nor to those who aim habitually at
10252,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"self-improvement; nor yet to the saintly type of character. I mean, not"
10253,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"that he _could_ not sympathise with them, but that they did not attract"
10254,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"him. Isabella, in _Measure for Measure_, is drawn, of course, with"
10255,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"understanding, but, it seems to me, with little sympathy. Her readiness"
10256,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"to abandon her pleading for Claudio, out of horror at his sin and a"
10257,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"sense of the justice of Angelo's reasons for refusing his pardon, is"
10258,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,doubtless in character; but if Shakespeare had sympathised more with her
10259,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"at this point, so should we; while, as it is, we are tempted to exclaim,"
10260,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10261,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"She loves him not, she wants the natural touch;"
10262,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10263,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,and perhaps if Shakespeare had liked her better and had not regarded her
10264,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"with some irony, he would not have allowed himself, for mere"
10265,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"convenience, to degrade her by marrying her to the Duke. Brutus and"
10266,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Cordelia, on the other hand, are drawn with the fullest imaginative"
10267,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"sympathy, and they, it may be said, are characters of principle; but"
10268,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,then (even if Cordelia could be truly so described) they are also
10269,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"intensely affectionate, and by no means inhumanly self-controlled."
10270,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10271,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,The mention of Brutus may carry us somewhat farther. Shakespeare's
10272,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Brutus kills Cæsar, not because Cæsar aims at absolute power, but"
10273,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,because Brutus fears that absolute power may make him cruel. That is not
10274,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Plutarch's idea, it is Shakespeare's. He could fully sympathise with the"
10275,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"gentleness of Brutus, with his entire superiority to private aims and"
10276,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"almost entire freedom from personal susceptibilities, and even with his"
10277,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,resolution to sacrifice his friend; but he could not so sympathise with
10278,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,mere horror of monarchy or absolute power. And now extend this a little.
10279,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Can you imagine Shakespeare an enthusiast for an 'idea'; a devotee of
10280,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"divine right, or the rights of Parliament, or any particular form of"
10281,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"government in Church or State; a Fifth Monarchy man, or a Quaker, or a"
10282,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"thick-and-thin adherent of any compact, exclusive, abstract creed, even"
10283,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"if it were as rational and noble as Mazzini's? This type of mind, even"
10284,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"at its best, is alien from his. Scott is said, rightly or wrongly, to"
10285,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,have portrayed the Covenanters without any deep understanding of them;
10286,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"it would have been the same with Shakespeare. I am not praising him, or"
10287,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,at least not merely praising him. One may even suggest that on this side
10288,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,he was limited. In any age he would have been safe against fanaticism
10289,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,and one-sided ideas; but perhaps in no age would he have been the man to
10290,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,insist with the necessary emphasis on those one-sided ideas which the
10291,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"moment may need, or even to give his whole heart to men who join a"
10292,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,forlorn hope or are martyred for a faith. And though it is rash to
10293,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"suggest that anything in the way of imagination was beyond his reach,"
10294,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"perhaps the legend of Faust, with his longings for infinite power and"
10295,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"knowledge and enjoyment of beauty, would have suited him less well than"
10296,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Marlowe; and if he had written on the subject that Cervantes took, his"
10297,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Don Quixote would have been at least as laughable as the hero we know,"
10298,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,but would he have been a soul so ideally noble and a figure so
10299,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,profoundly pathetic?
10300,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10301,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,This would be the natural place to discuss Shakespeare's politics if we
10302,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,were to discuss them at all. But even if the question whether he shows
10303,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"any interest in the political differences of his time, or any sympathies"
10304,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"or antipathies in regard to them, admits of an answer, it could be"
10305,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"answered only by an examination of details; and I must pass it by, and"
10306,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"offer only the briefest remarks on a wider question. Shakespeare, as we"
10307,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"might expect, shows no sign of believing in what is sometimes called a"
10308,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"political 'principle.' The main ideas which, consciously or"
10309,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"unconsciously, seem to govern or emerge from his presentation of state"
10310,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"affairs, might perhaps be put thus. National welfare is the end of"
10311,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"politics, and the criterion by which political actions are to be judged."
10312,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"It implies of necessity 'degree'; that is, differences of position and"
10313,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,function in the members of the body politic.[28] And the first
10314,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"requisites of national welfare are the observance of this degree, and"
10315,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,the concordant performance of these functions in the general interest.
10316,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,But there appear to be no further absolute principles than these: beyond
10317,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,them all is relative to the particular case and its particular
10318,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"conditions. We find no hint, for example, in _Julius Cæsar_ that"
10319,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Shakespeare regarded a monarchical form of government as intrinsically
10320,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"better than a republican, or _vice versa_; no trace in _Richard II._"
10321,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"that the author shares the king's belief in his inviolable right, or"
10322,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"regards Bolingbroke's usurpation as justifiable. We perceive, again,"
10323,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"pretty clearly in several plays a dislike and contempt of demagogues,"
10324,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and an opinion that mobs are foolish, fickle, and ungrateful. But these"
10325,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"are sentiments which the most determined of believers in democracy, if"
10326,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"he has sense, may share; and if he thinks that the attitude of"
10327,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,aristocrats like Volumnia and Coriolanus is inhuman and as inexcusable
10328,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"as that of the mob, and that a mob is as easily led right as wrong and"
10329,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"has plenty of good nature in it, he has abundant ground for holding that"
10330,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Shakespeare thought so too. That Shakespeare greatly liked and admired
10331,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,the typical qualities of the best kind of aristocrat seems highly
10332,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,probable; but then this taste has always been compatible with a great
10333,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,variety of political opinions. It is interesting but useless to wonder
10334,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,what his own opinions would have been at various periods of English
10335,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,history: perhaps the only thing we can be pretty sure of in regard to
10336,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"them is that they would never have been extreme, and that he would never"
10337,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,have supposed his opponents to be entirely wrong.
10338,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10339,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"We have tried to conjecture the impulses, passions, and errors with"
10340,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"which Shakespeare could easily sympathise, and the virtues and types of"
10341,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,character which he may have approved without much sympathy. It remains
10342,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,to ask whether we can notice tendencies and vices to which he felt any
10343,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,special antipathy; and it is obvious and safe to point to those most
10344,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"alien to a gentle, open, and free nature, the vices of a cold and hard"
10345,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"disposition, self-centred and incapable of fusion with others. Passing"
10346,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"over, again, the plainly hideous forms or extremes of such vice, as we"
10347,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"see them in characters like Richard III., Iago, Goneril and Regan, or"
10348,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the Queen in _Cymbeline_, we seem to detect a particular aversion to"
10349,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"certain vices which have the common mark of baseness; for instance,"
10350,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,servility and flattery (especially when deliberate and practised with a
10351,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"view to self-advancement), feigning in friendship, and ingratitude."
10352,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Shakespeare's _animus_ against the dog arises from the attribution of
10353,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"these vices to him, and against them in men are directed the invectives"
10354,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,which seem to have a personal ring. There appears to be traceable also a
10355,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"feeling of a special, though less painful, kind against unmercifulness."
10356,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"I do not mean, of course, cruelty, but unforgivingness, and even the"
10357,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"tendency to prefer justice to mercy. From no other dramatic author,"
10358,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"probably, could there be collected such prolonged and heart-felt praises"
10359,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"of mercy as from Shakespeare. He had not at all strongly, I think, that"
10360,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,instinct and love of justice and retribution which in many men are so
10361,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"powerful; but Prospero's words,"
10362,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10363,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"they being penitent,"
10364,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
10365,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Not a jot further,"
10366,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10367,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,came from his heart. He perceived with extreme clearness the connection
10368,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,of acts with their consequences; but his belief that in this sense 'the
10369,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,gods are just' was accompanied by the strongest feeling that forgiveness
10370,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"ought to follow repentance, and (if I may so put it) his favourite"
10371,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,petition was the one that begins 'Forgive us our trespasses.' To
10372,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"conclude, I have fancied that he shows an unusual degree of disgust at"
10373,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,slander and dislike of censoriousness; and where he speaks in the
10374,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Sonnets of those who censured him he betrays an exceptionally decided
10375,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,feeling that a man's offences are his own affair and not the
10376,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,world's.[29]
10377,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10378,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Some of the vices which seem to have been particularly odious to
10379,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Shakespeare have, we may notice, a special connection with prosperity"
10380,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,and power. Men feign and creep and flatter to please the powerful and
10381,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,to win their own way to ease or power; and they envy and censure and
10382,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"slander their competitors in the race; and when they succeed, they are"
10383,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,ungrateful to their friends and helpers and patrons; and they become
10384,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"hard and unmerciful, and despise and bully those who are now below them."
10385,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"So, perhaps, Shakespeare said to himself in those years when, as we"
10386,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"imagine, melancholy and embitterment often overclouded his sky, though"
10387,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,they did not obscure his faith in goodness and much less his
10388,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"intellectual vision. And prosperity and power, he may have added, come"
10389,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,less frequently by merit than by those base arts or by mere fortune. The
10390,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"divorce of goodness and power was, to Shelley, the 'woe of the world';"
10391,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"if we substitute for 'goodness' the wider word 'merit,' we may say that"
10392,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"this divorce, with the evil bred by power, is to Shakespeare also the"
10393,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"root of bitterness. This fact, presented in its extreme form of the"
10394,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"appalling cruelty of the prosperous, and the heart-rending suffering of"
10395,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the defenceless, forms the problem of his most tremendous drama. We have"
10396,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,no reason to surmise that his own sufferings were calamitous; and the
10397,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,period which seems to be marked by melancholy and embitterment was one
10398,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"of outward, or at least financial, prosperity; but nevertheless we can"
10399,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,hardly doubt that he felt on the small scale of his own life the
10400,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,influence of that divorce of power and merit. His complaint against
10401,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Fortune, who had so ill provided for his life, runs through the Sonnets."
10402,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Even if we could regard as purely conventional the declarations that his
10403,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"verses would make his friend immortal, it is totally impossible that he"
10404,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,can have been unaware of the gulf between his own gifts and those of
10405,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"others, or can have failed to feel the disproportion between his"
10406,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,position and his mind. Hamlet had never experienced
10407,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10408,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,the spurns
10409,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"That patient merit of the unworthy takes,"
10410,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10411,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,and that make the patient soul weary of life; the man who had
10412,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"experienced them was the writer of Sonnet 66, who cried for death"
10413,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,because he was tired with beholding
10414,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10415,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"desert a beggar born,"
10416,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"And needy nothing trimmed in jollity,"
10417,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10418,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,--a beggarly soul flaunting in brave array. Neither had Hamlet felt in
10419,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,his own person 'the insolence of office'; but the actor had doubtless
10420,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"felt it often enough, and we can hardly err in hearing his own voice in"
10421,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,dramatic expressions of wonder and contempt at the stupid pride of mere
10422,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,authority and at men's slavish respect for it. Two examples will
10423,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"suffice. 'Thou hast seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar, and the"
10424,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great image of
10425,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"authority. A dog's obeyed in office': so says Lear, when madness has"
10426,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"cleared his vision, and indignation makes the Timon-like verses that"
10427,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,follow. The other example is almost too famous for quotation but I have
10428,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,a reason for quoting it:
10429,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10430,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"man, proud man,"
10431,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Drest in a little brief authority,"
10432,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Most ignorant of what he's most assured,"
10433,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"His glassy essence, like an angry ape,"
10434,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
10435,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"As makes the angels weep; who, with our spleens,"
10436,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Would all themselves laugh mortal.
10437,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10438,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,It is Isabella who says that; but it is scarcely in character;
10439,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Shakespeare himself is speaking.[30]
10440,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10441,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,It is with great hesitation that I hazard a few words on Shakespeare's
10442,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,religion. Any attempt to penetrate his reserve on this subject may
10443,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"appear a crowning impertinence; and, since his dramas are almost"
10444,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"exclusively secular, any impressions we may form must here be even more"
10445,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,speculative than usual. Yet it is scarcely possible to read him much
10446,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,without such speculations; and there are at least some theories which
10447,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,may confidently be dismissed. It cannot be called absolutely impossible
10448,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"that Shakespeare was indifferent to music and to the beauty of Nature,"
10449,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and yet the idea is absurd; and in the same way it is barely possible,"
10450,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and yet it is preposterous, to suppose that he was an ardent and devoted"
10451,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"atheist or Brownist or Roman Catholic, and that all the indications to"
10452,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,the contrary are due to his artfulness and determination not to get into
10453,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"trouble. There is no absurdity, on the other hand, nor of necessity"
10454,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"anything hopeless, in the question whether there are signs that he"
10455,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"belonged to this or that church, and was inclined to one mode of thought"
10456,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,within it rather than to another. Only the question is scarcely worth
10457,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"asking for our present purpose, unless there is some reason to believe"
10458,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"that he took a keen interest in these matters. Suppose, for example,"
10459,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"that we had ground to accept a tradition that he 'died a papist,' this"
10460,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,would not tell us much about him unless we had also ground to think that
10461,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"he lived a papist, and that his faith went far into his personality. But"
10462,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"in fact we receive from his writings, it appears to me, a rather strong"
10463,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"impression that he concerned himself little, if at all, with differences"
10464,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,of doctrine or church government.[31] And we may go further. Have we not
10465,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"reason to surmise that he was not, in the distinctive sense of the word,"
10466,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"a religious man--a man, that is to say, whose feelings and actions are"
10467,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,constantly and strongly influenced by thoughts of his relation to an
10468,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"object of worship? If Shakespeare had been such a man, is it credible"
10469,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,that we should find nothing in tradition or in his works to indicate the
10470,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,fact; and is it likely that we should find in his works some things
10471,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,that we do find there?[32]
10472,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10473,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Venturing with much doubt a little farther I will put together certain
10474,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,facts and impressions without at once drawing any conclusion from them.
10475,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Almost all the speeches that can be called pronouncedly religious and
10476,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Christian in phraseology and spirit are placed in the mouths of persons
10477,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"to whom they are obviously appropriate, either from their position"
10478,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"(_e.g._ bishops, friars, nuns), or from what Shakespeare found in"
10479,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"histories (_e.g._ Henry IV., V., and VI.), or for some other plain"
10480,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"reason. We cannot build, therefore, on these speeches in the least. On"
10481,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the other hand (except, of course, where they are hypocritical or"
10482,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"politic), we perceive in Shakespeare's tone in regard to them not the"
10483,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,faintest trace of dislike or contempt; nor can we find a trace anywhere
10484,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"of such feelings, or of irreverence, towards Christian ideas,"
10485,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"institutions, or customs (mere humorous irreverence is not relevant"
10486,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"here); and in the case of 'sympathetic' characters, living in Christian"
10487,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"times but not in any decided sense religious, no disposition is visible"
10488,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"to suppress or ignore their belief in, and use of, religious ideas. Some"
10489,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"characters, again, Christian or heathen, who appear to be drawn with"
10490,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"rather marked sympathy, have strong, if simple, religious convictions"
10491,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"(e.g. Horatio, Edgar, Hermione); and in others, of whom so much can"
10492,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"hardly be said, but who strike many readers, rightly or wrongly, as"
10493,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"having a good deal of Shakespeare in them (_e.g._ Romeo and Hamlet), we"
10494,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,observe a quiet but deep sense that they and other men are neither their
10495,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"own masters nor responsible only to themselves and other men, but are in"
10496,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,the hands of 'Providence' or guiding powers 'above.'[33]
10497,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10498,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"To this I will add two remarks. To every one, I suppose, certain"
10499,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,speeches sound peculiarly personal. Perhaps others may share my feeling
10500,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,about Hamlet's words:
10501,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10502,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"There's a divinity that shapes our ends,"
10503,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Rough-hew them how we will;
10504,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10505,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,and about those other words of his:
10506,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10507,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,"
10508,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Than are dreamt of in your philosophy;
10509,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10510,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and about the speech of Prospero ending, 'We are such stuff as dreams"
10511,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"are made on.'[34] On the other hand, we observe that Hamlet seems to"
10512,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"have arrived at that conviction as to the 'divinity' after reflection,"
10513,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and that, while he usually speaks as one who accepts the received"
10514,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Christian ideas, yet, when meditating profoundly, he appears to ignore"
10515,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,them.[35] In the same way the Duke in _Measure for Measure_ is for the
10516,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"most part, and necessarily, a Christian; yet nobody would guess it from"
10517,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the great speech, 'Be absolute for death,' addressed by a supposed friar"
10518,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"to a youth under sentence to die, yet containing not a syllable about a"
10519,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,future life.[36]
10520,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10521,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Without adducing more of the endless but baffling material for a
10522,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"conclusion, I will offer the result left on my mind, and, merely for the"
10523,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"sake of brevity, will state it with hardly any of the qualifications it"
10524,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"doubtless needs. Shakespeare, I imagine, was not, in the sense assigned"
10525,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"to the word some minutes ago, a religious man. Nor was it natural to him"
10526,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"to regard good and evil, better and worse, habitually from a theological"
10527,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,point of view. But (this appears certain) he had a lively and serious
10528,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"sense of 'conscience,' of the pain of self-reproach and"
10529,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"self-condemnation, and of the torment to which this pain might rise.[37]"
10530,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,He was not in the least disposed to regard conscience as somehow
10531,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"illusory or a human invention, but on the contrary thought of it (I use"
10532,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,the most non-committal phrase I can find) as connected with the power
10533,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,that rules the world and is not escapable by man. He realised very fully
10534,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and felt very keenly, after his youth was past and at certain times of"
10535,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"stress, the sufferings and wrongs of men, the strength of evil, the"
10536,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"hideousness of certain forms of it, and its apparent incurability in"
10537,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,certain cases. And he must sometimes have felt all this as a terrible
10538,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"problem. But, however he may have been tempted, and may have yielded, to"
10539,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"exasperation and even despair, he never doubted that it is best to be"
10540,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,good; felt more and more that one must be patient and must forgive;[38]
10541,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and probably maintained unbroken a conviction, practical if not"
10542,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"formulated, that to be good is to be at peace with that unescapable"
10543,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,power. But it is unlikely that he attempted to theorise further on the
10544,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"nature of the power. All was for him, in the end, mystery; and, while we"
10545,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,have no reason whatever to attribute to him a belief in the ghosts and
10546,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"oracles he used in his dramas, he had no inclination to play the spy on"
10547,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,God or to limit his power by our notions of it. That he had dreams and
10548,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,ponderings about the mystery such as he never put into the mouths of
10549,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,actors I do not doubt; but I imagine they were no more than dreams and
10550,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,ponderings and movings about in worlds unrealised.
10551,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10552,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Whether to this 'religion' he joined a more or less conventional
10553,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"acceptance of some or all of the usual Christian ideas, it is impossible"
10554,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,to tell. There is no great improbability to me in the idea that he did
10555,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"not, but it is more probable to me that he did,--that, in fact, though"
10556,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"he was never so tormented as Hamlet, his position in this matter was, at"
10557,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"least in middle life (and he never reached old age), much like Hamlet's."
10558,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"If this were so it might naturally happen that, as he grew older and"
10559,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"wearier of labour, and perhaps of the tumult of pleasure and thought and"
10560,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"pain, his more personal religion, the natural piety which seems to gain"
10561,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"in weight and serenity in the latest plays, came to be more closely"
10562,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,joined with Christian ideas. But I can find no clear indications that
10563,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,this did happen; and though some have believed that they discovered
10564,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"these ideas displayed in full, though not explicitly, in the _Tempest_,"
10565,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,I am not able to hear there more than the stream of Shakespeare's own
10566,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,'religion' moving with its fullest volume and making its deepest and
10567,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,most harmonious music.[39]
10568,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10569,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"This lecture must end, though its subject is endless, and I will touch"
10570,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"on only one point more,--one that may to some extent recall and connect"
10571,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,the scattered suggestions I have offered.
10572,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10573,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,If we were obliged to answer the question which of Shakespeare's plays
10574,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"contains, not indeed the fullest picture of his mind, but the truest"
10575,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"expression of his nature and habitual temper, unaffected by special"
10576,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"causes of exhilaration or gloom, I should be disposed to choose _As You"
10577,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Like It_. It wants, to go no further, the addition of a touch of Sir"
10578,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Toby or Falstaff, and the ejection of its miraculous conversions of"
10579,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"ill-disposed characters. But the misbehaviour of Fortune, and the"
10580,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"hardness and ingratitude of men, form the basis of its plot, and are a"
10581,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"frequent topic of complaint. And, on the other hand, he who is reading"
10582,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"it has a smooth brow and smiling lips, and a heart that murmurs,"
10583,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10584,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Happy is your grace,"
10585,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
10586,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
10587,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10588,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"And it is full not only of sweetness, but of romance, fun, humour of"
10589,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"various kinds, delight in the oddities of human nature, love of modesty"
10590,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"and fidelity and high spirit and patience, dislike of scandal and"
10591,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"censure, contemplative curiosity, the feeling that in the end we are all"
10592,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"merely players, together with a touch of the feeling that"
10593,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10594,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Then is there mirth in heaven
10595,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,When earthly things made even
10596,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Atone together.
10597,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10598,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"And, finally, it breathes the serene holiday mood of escape from the"
10599,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"toil, competition, and corruption of city and court into the sun and"
10600,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"shadow and peace of the country, where one can be idle and dream and"
10601,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"meditate and sing, and pursue or watch the deer as the fancy takes one,"
10602,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,and make love or smile at lovers according to one's age.[40]
10603,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,
10604,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"If, again, the question were put to us, which of Shakespeare's"
10605,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"characters reveals most of his personality, the majority of those who"
10606,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,consented to give an answer would answer 'Hamlet.' This impression may
10607,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"be fanciful, but it is difficult to think it wholly so, and, speaking"
10608,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"for those who share it, I will try to trace some of its sources. There"
10609,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"is a good deal of Shakespeare that is not in Hamlet. But Hamlet, we"
10610,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"think, is the only character in Shakespeare who could possibly have"
10611,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"composed his plays (though it appears unlikely, from his verses to"
10612,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Ophelia, that he could have written the best songs). Into Hamlet's mouth"
10613,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,are put what are evidently Shakespeare's own views on drama and acting.
10614,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Hamlet alone, among the great serious characters, can be called a"
10615,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,humorist. When in some trait of another character we seem to touch
10616,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Shakespeare's personality, we are frequently reminded of Hamlet.[41]"
10617,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"When in a profound reflective speech we hear Shakespeare's voice, we"
10618,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"usually hear Hamlet's too, and his peculiar humour and turns of phrase"
10619,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,appear unexpectedly in persons otherwise unlike him and unlike one
10620,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,another. The most melancholy group of Sonnets (71-74) recalls Hamlet at
10621,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"once, here and there recalls even his words; and he and the writer of"
10622,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,Sonnet 66 both recount in a list the ills that make men long for death.
10623,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,And then Hamlet 'was indeed honest and of an open and free nature';
10624,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"sweet-tempered and modest, yet not slow to resent calumny or injury; of"
10625,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,a serious but not a melancholy disposition; and the lover of his friend.
10626,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"And, with these traits, we remember his poet ecstasy at the glory of"
10627,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,earth and sky and the marvellous endowments of man; his eager
10628,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,affectionate response to everything noble or sweet in human nature; his
10629,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,tendency to dream and to live in the world of his own mind; his
10630,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"liability to sudden vehement emotion, and his admiration for men whose"
10631,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,blood and judgment are better commingled; the overwhelming effect of
10632,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"disillusionment upon him; his sadness, fierceness, bitterness and"
10633,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"cynicism. All this, and more: his sensitiveness to the call of duty; his"
10634,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"longing to answer to it, and his anguish over his strange delay; the"
10635,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,conviction gathering in his tortured soul that man's purposes and
10636,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,failures are divinely shaped to ends beyond his vision; his incessant
10637,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"meditation, and his sense that there are mysteries which no meditation"
10638,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"can fathom; nay, even little traits like his recourse to music to calm"
10639,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"his excitement, or his feeling on the one hand that the peasant should"
10640,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"not tread on the courtier's heels, and on the other that the mere"
10641,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"courtier is spacious in the possession of dirt--all this, I say,"
10642,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"corresponds with our impression of Shakespeare, or rather of"
10643,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"characteristic traits in Shakespeare, probably here and there a good"
10644,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"deal heightened, and mingled with others not characteristic of"
10645,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"Shakespeare at all. And if this is more than fancy, it may explain to us"
10646,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"why Hamlet is the most fascinating character, and the most"
10647,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"inexhaustible, in all imaginative literature. What else should he be, if"
10648,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"the world's greatest poet, who was able to give almost the reality of"
10649,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"nature to creations totally unlike himself, put his own soul straight"
10650,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,"into this creation, and when he wrote Hamlet's speeches wrote down his"
10651,SHAKESPEARE THE MAN,own heart?[42]

10971,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,The vast majority of his readers since the Restoration have known
10972,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"nothing about them, and have enjoyed his plays enormously. And if they"
10973,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"have enjoyed without fully understanding, it was for want of imagination"
10974,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"and of knowledge of human nature, and not from ignorance of the"
10975,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"conditions under which his plays were produced. At any rate, such"
10976,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"ignorance does not exclude us from the _soul_ of Shakespearean drama,"
10977,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,any more than from the soul of Homeric epic or Athenian tragedy; and it
10978,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"is the soul that counts and endures. For the rest, we all know that"
10979,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Shakespeare's time was rough, indecorous, and inexpert in regard to"
10980,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,machinery; and so we are prepared for coarse speech and primitive
10981,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"stage-arrangements, and we make allowance for them without thinking"
10982,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,about the matter. Antiquarians may naturally wish to know more; but what

10984,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,

10987,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,comparatively unimportant for the appreciation of that which is most
10988,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,vital in Shakespeare; and if I were allowed my choice between an hour's
10989,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,inspection of a performance at the Globe and a glimpse straight into his
10990,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"mind when he was planning the _Tempest_, I should not hesitate which to"
10991,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"choose. Nevertheless, to say nothing of the intrinsic interest of"
10992,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"antiquarian knowledge, we cannot make a clear division between the soul"
10993,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"and body, or the eternal and the perishable, in works of art. Nor can we"
10994,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,lay the finger on a line which separates that which has poetic interest
10995,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,from that which has none. Nor yet can we assume that any knowledge of
10996,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Shakespeare's theatre and audience, however trivial it may appear, may"
10997,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"not help us to appreciate, or save us from misapprehending, the 'soul'"
10998,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"of a play or a scene. If our own souls were capacious and vivid enough,"
10999,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"every atom of information on these subjects, or again on the material he"
11000,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"used in composing, would so assist us. The danger of devotion to such"
11001,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"knowledge lies merely in our weakness. Research, though toilsome, is"
11002,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"easy; imaginative vision, though delightful, is difficult; and we may be"
11003,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,tempted to prefer the first. Or we note that in a given passage
11004,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Shakespeare has used what he found in his authority; and we excuse
11005,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,ourselves from asking why he used it and what he made of it. Or we see
11006,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,that he has done something that would please his audience; and we
11007,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"dismiss it as accounted for, forgetting that perhaps it also pleased"
11008,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"_him_, and that we have to account for _that_. Or knowledge of his stage"
11009,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,shows us the stage-convenience of a scene; and we say that the scene was
11010,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"due to stage-convenience, as if the cause of a thing must needs be"
11011,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,single and simple. Such errors provoke the man who reads his Shakespeare
11012,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"poetically, and make him blaspheme our knowledge. But we ought not to"
11013,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,fall into them; and we cannot reject any knowledge that may help us into
11014,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Shakespeare's mind because of the danger it brings.
11015,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11016,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"I cannot attempt to describe Shakespeare's theatre and audience, and"
11017,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"much less to discuss the evidence on which a description must be based,"
11018,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,or the difficult problems it raises. I must confine myself for the most
11019,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"part to a few points which are not always fully realised, or on which"
11020,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,there is a risk of misapprehension.
11021,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11022,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11023,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,1.
11024,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11025,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Shakespeare, we know, was a popular playwright. I mean not only that"
11026,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"many of his plays were favourites in his day, but that he wrote, mainly"
11027,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"at least, for the more popular kind of audience, and that, within"
11028,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"certain limits, he conformed to its tastes. He was not, to our"
11029,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"knowledge, the author of masques composed for performance at Court or in"
11030,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"a great mansion, or of dramas intended for a University or one of the"
11031,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Inns of Court; and though his company for some time played at the
11032,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Blackfriars, we may safely assume that the great majority of his works"
11033,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,were meant primarily for a common or 'public' theatre like the Globe.
11034,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,The broad distinction between a 'private' and a 'public' theatre is
11035,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"familiar, and I need only remind you that at the former, which was"
11036,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"smaller, provided seats even in the area, and was nowhere open to the"
11037,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"weather, the audience was more select. Accordingly, dramatists who"
11038,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"express their contempt for the audience, and their disapproval of those"
11039,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"who consult its tastes, often discriminate between the audiences at the"
11040,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"private and public theatres, and reserve their unmeasured language for"
11041,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,the latter. It was for the latter that Shakespeare mainly wrote; and it
11042,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"is pretty clear that Jonson, who greatly admired and loved him, was"
11043,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,still of opinion that he condescended to his audience.[1]
11044,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11045,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,So far we seem to be on safe ground; and yet even here there is some
11046,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,risk of mistake. We are not to imagine that the audience at a private
11047,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"theatre (say the Blackfriars) accepted Jonson's dramatic theories,"
11048,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,while the audience at the Globe rejected them; or that the one was
11049,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"composed chiefly of cultured and 'judicious' gentlemen, and the other of"
11050,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,riotous and malodorous plebeians; and still less that Shakespeare tried
11051,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"to please the latter section in preference to the former, and was"
11052,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,beloved by the one more than by the other. The two audiences must have
11053,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"had the same general character, differing only in degree. Neither of"
11054,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"them accepted Jonson's theories, nor were the 'judicious' of one mind on"
11055,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,that subject. The same play was frequently offered to both. Both were
11056,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,very mixed. The tastes to which objection was taken cannot have been
11057,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"confined to the mob. From our knowledge of human nature generally, and"
11058,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"of the Elizabethan nobility and gentry in particular, we may be sure of"
11059,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,this; and Jonson himself implies it. Nor is it credible that an
11060,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"appreciation of the best things was denied to the mob, which doubtless"
11061,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"loved what we should despise, but appears also to have admired what we"
11062,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"admire, and to have tolerated more poetry than most of us can stomach."
11063,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Neither can these groundlings have formed the majority of the 'public'
11064,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"audience or have been omnipotent in their theatre, when it was possible"
11065,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,for dramatists (Shakespeare included) to say such rude things of them to
11066,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,their faces. We must not delude ourselves as to these matters; and in
11067,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,particular we must realise that the mass of the audience in both kinds
11068,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"of theatre must have been indifferent to the unities of time and place,"
11069,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,and more or less so to improbabilities and to decorum (at least as we
11070,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,conceive it) both in manners and in speech; and that it must have liked
11071,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"excitement, the open exhibition of violent and bloody deeds, and the"
11072,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,intermixture of seriousness and mirth. What distinguished the more
11073,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"popular audience, and the more popular section in it, was a higher"
11074,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"degree of this indifference and this liking, and in addition a special"
11075,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,fondness for certain sources of inartistic joy. The most prominent of
11076,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"these, perhaps, were noise; rant; mere bawdry; 'shews'; irrelevant"
11077,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"songs, ballads, jokes, dances, and clownage in general; and, lastly,"
11078,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,target-fighting and battles.[2]
11079,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11080,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,We may describe Shakespeare's practice in broad and general terms by
11081,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,saying that he neither resisted the wishes of his audience nor gratified
11082,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"them without reserve. He accepted the type of drama that he found, and"
11083,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,developed it without altering its fundamental character. And in the same
11084,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"way, in particular matters, he gave the audience what it wanted, but in"
11085,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,doing so gave it what it never dreamed of. It liked tragedy to be
11086,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"relieved by rough mirth, and it got the Grave-diggers in _Hamlet_ and"
11087,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,the old countryman in _Antony and Cleopatra_. It liked a 'drum and
11088,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"trumpet' history, and it got _Henry V._ It liked clowns or fools, and it"
11089,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,got Feste and the Fool in _King Lear_. Shakespeare's practice was by no
11090,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"means always on this level, but this was its tendency; and I imagine"
11091,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"that (unless perhaps in early days) he knew clearly what he was doing,"
11092,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"did it deliberately, and, when he gave the audience poor stuff, would"
11093,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"not seriously have defended himself. Jonson, it would seem, did not"
11094,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,understand this position. A fool was a fool to him; and if a play could
11095,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,be called a drum and trumpet history it was at once condemned in his
11096,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,eyes. One can hardly doubt that he was alluding to the _Tempest_ and the
11097,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"_Winter's Tale_ when, a few years after the probable date of their"
11098,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"appearance, he spoke of writers who 'make nature afraid in their plays,'"
11099,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"begetting 'tales, tempests, and such like drolleries,' and bringing in"
11100,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"'a servant-monster' or 'a nest of antiques.' Caliban was a 'monster,'"
11101,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"and the London public loved to gape at monsters; and so, it appears,"
11102,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"that wonderful creation was to Jonson something like the fat woman, or"
11103,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the calf with five legs, that we pay a penny to see at a fair. In fact"
11104,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,(how could he fail to take the warning?) he saw Caliban with the eyes of
11105,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Trinculo and Stephano. 'A strange fish!' says Trinculo: 'were I in
11106,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"England now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday"
11107,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"fool there but would give a piece of silver.' 'If I can recover him,'"
11108,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"says Stephano, 'and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a"
11109,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's-leather.' Shakespeare
11110,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"understood his monster otherwise; but, I fancy, when Jonson fulminated"
11111,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"at the Mermaid against Caliban, he smiled and said nothing."
11112,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11113,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,But my present subject is rather the tastes of the audience than
11114,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Shakespeare's way of meeting them.[3] Let me give two illustrations of
11115,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"them which may have some novelty. His public, in the first place, dearly"
11116,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"loved to see soldiers, combats, and battles on the stage. They swarm in"
11117,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"some of the dramas a little earlier than Shakespeare's time, and the"
11118,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"cultured dramatists speak very contemptuously of these productions, if"
11119,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,not of Shakespeare's historical plays. We may take as an example the
11120,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"First Part of _Henry VI._, a feeble piece, to which Shakespeare probably"
11121,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"contributed touches throughout, and perhaps one or two complete scenes."
11122,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"It appears from the stage directions (which may be defective, but cannot"
11123,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,well be redundant) that in this one play there were represented a
11124,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"pitched battle of two armies, an attack on a city wall with"
11125,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"scaling-ladders, two street-scuffles, four single combats, four"
11126,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"skirmishes, and seven excursions. No genuine play of Shakespeare's, I"
11127,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"suppose, is so military from beginning to end; and we know how in _Henry"
11128,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,V._ he laments that he must disgrace the name of Agincourt by showing
11129,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,four or five men with vile and ragged foils
11130,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11131,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous.
11132,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11133,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Still he does show them; and his serious dramas contain such a profusion
11134,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,of combats and battles as no playwright now would dream of exhibiting.
11135,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"We expect these things perhaps in the English history-plays, and we"
11136,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,find them in abundance there: but not there alone. The last Act in
11137,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"_Julius Cæsar_, _Troilus and Cressida_, _King Lear_, _Macbeth_, and"
11138,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,_Cymbeline_; the fourth Act of _Antony and Cleopatra_; the opening Acts
11139,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"of _Coriolanus_,--these are all full of battle-scenes. If battle cannot"
11140,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"be shown, it can be described. If it cannot be described, still soldiers"
11141,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"can be shown, and twice in _Hamlet_ Fortinbras and his army march upon"
11142,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the stage.[4] At worst there can be street-brawls and single fights, as"
11143,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,in _Romeo and Juliet_. In reading Shakespeare we scarcely realise how
11144,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,much of this kind is exhibited. In seeing him acted we do not fully
11145,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"realise it, for much of it is omitted. But beyond doubt it helped to"
11146,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,make him the most popular dramatist of his time.
11147,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11148,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,If we examine Shakespeare's battles we shall observe a certain
11149,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"peculiarity, which is connected with the nature of his theatre and also"
11150,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,explains the treatment of them in ours. In most cases he does not give a
11151,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"picture of two whole armies engaged, but makes a pair of combatants rush"
11152,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"upon the stage, fight, and rush off again; and this pair is succeeded by"
11153,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"a second, and perhaps by a third. This hurried series of single combats"
11154,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,admitted of speech-making; perhaps it also gave some impression of the
11155,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"changes and confusion of a battle. Our tendency, on the other hand, is"
11156,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"to contrive one spectacle with scenic effects, or even to exhibit one"
11157,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"magnificent tableau in which nobody says a word. And this plan, though"
11158,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"it has the advantage of getting rid of Shakespeare's poetry, is not"
11159,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,exactly dramatic. It is adopted chiefly because the taste of our public
11160,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"is, or is supposed to be, less dramatic than spectacular, and because,"
11161,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"unlike the Elizabethans, we are able to gratify such a taste. But there"
11162,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,is another fact to be remembered here. Few playgoers now can appreciate
11163,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"a fencing-match, and much fewer a broad-sword and target fight. But the"
11164,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Elizabethan public went to see performances of this kind as we go to see
11165,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,cricket or football matches. They might watch them in the very building
11166,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,which at other times was used as a playhouse.[5] They could judge of the
11167,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"merit of the exhibition when Hotspur and Prince Henry fought, when"
11168,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Macduff 'laid on,' or when Tybalt and Mercutio used their rapiers. And"
11169,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,this was probably another reason why Shakespeare's battles so often
11170,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"consist of single combats, and why these scenes were beloved by the"
11171,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,simpler folk among his audience.
11172,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11173,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Our second illustration concerns the popular appetite for musical and
11174,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,other sounds. The introduction of songs and dances[6] was censured as a
11175,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,corrupt gratification of this appetite. And so it was when the songs and
11176,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"dances were excessive in number, irrelevant, or out of keeping with the"
11177,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,scene. I do not remember that in Shakespeare's plays this is ever the
11178,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"case; but, in respect of songs, we may perhaps take Marston's _Antonio"
11179,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,and Mellida_ as an instance of abuse. For in each of the two Parts of
11180,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"that play there are directions for five songs; and, since not even the"
11181,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"first lines of these songs are printed, we must suppose that the leader"
11182,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"of the band, or the singing actor in the company, introduced whatever he"
11183,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"chose. In addition to songs and dances, the musicians, at least in some"
11184,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"plays, performed between the Acts; and the practice of accompanying"
11185,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,certain speeches by low music--a practice which in some performances of
11186,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Shakespeare now has become a pest--has the sanction of several
11187,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Elizabethan playwrights, and (to a slight extent) of Shakespeare. It"
11188,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"seems clear, for example, that in _Twelfth Night_ low music was played"
11189,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"while the lovely opening lines ('That strain again') were being spoken,"
11190,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"and also during a part of the dialogue preceding the song 'Come away,"
11191,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"come away, death.' Some lines, too, of Lorenzo's famous speech about"
11192,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,music in the _Merchant of Venice_ were probably accompanied; and there
11193,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,is a still more conspicuous instance in the scene where Lear wakes from
11194,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,his long sleep and sees Cordelia standing by his side.
11195,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11196,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"But, beyond all this, if we attend to the stage-directions we shall"
11197,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,realise that in the serious plays of Shakespeare other musical sounds
11198,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,were of frequent occurrence. Almost always the ceremonial entrance of a
11199,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"royal person is marked by a 'flourish' or a 'sennet' on trumpets,"
11200,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"cornets, or hautboys; and wherever we have armies and battles we find"
11201,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"directions for drums, or for particular series of notes of trumpets or"
11202,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,cornets appropriate to particular military movements. In the First Part
11203,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"of _Henry VI._, to take that early play again, we must imagine a dead"
11204,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"march, two other marches, three retreats, three sennets, seven"
11205,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"flourishes, eighteen alarums; and there are besides five directions for"
11206,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"drums, one for a horn, and five for soundings, of a kind not specified,"
11207,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,by trumpets. In the last three scenes of the first Act in
11208,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,_Coriolanus_--scenes containing less than three hundred and fifty
11209,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"lines--there are directions for a parley, a retreat, five flourishes,"
11210,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"and eight alarums, with three, less specific, for trumpets, and four for"
11211,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"drums. We find about twenty such directions in _King Lear_, and about"
11212,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"twenty-five in _Macbeth_, a short play in which hautboys seem to have"
11213,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,been unusually favoured.[7] It is evident that the audience loved these
11214,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"sounds, which, from their prevalence in passages of special kinds, seem"
11215,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"to have been intended chiefly to stimulate excitement, and sometimes to"
11216,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,heighten impressions of grandeur or of awe.
11217,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11218,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,But this is not all. Such purposes were also served by noises not
11219,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"musical. Four times in _Macbeth_, when the Witches appear, thunder is"
11220,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,heard. It thunders and lightens at intervals through the storm-scenes in
11221,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"_King Lear_. Casca and Cassius, dark thoughts within them, walk the"
11222,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,streets of Rome in a terrific thunderstorm. That loud insistent knocking
11223,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,which appalled Macbeth is repeated thrice at intervals while Lady
11224,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Macbeth in vain endeavours to calm him, and five times while the Porter"
11225,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,fumbles with his keys. The gate has hardly been opened and the murder
11226,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,discovered when the castle-bell begins its hideous alarum. The
11227,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,alarm-bell is used for the same purpose of intensifying excitement in
11228,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the brawl that ruins Cassio, and its effect is manifest in Othello's"
11229,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"immediate order, 'Silence that dreadful bell.' I will add but one"
11230,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"instance more. In the days of my youth, before the melodrama audience"
11231,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"dreamed of seeing chariot-races, railway accidents, or the infernal"
11232,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"regions, on the stage, it loved few things better than the explosion of"
11233,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,fire-arms; and its favourite weapon was the pistol. The Elizabethans had
11234,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the same fancy for fire-arms, only they preferred cannon. Shakespeare's"
11235,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"theatre was burnt down in 1613 at a performance of _Henry VIII._, not, I"
11236,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"suppose, as Prynne imagined, by a Providence which shared his opinion of"
11237,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the drama, but because the wadding of a cannon fired during the play"
11238,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,flew to the thatch of the roof and set it ablaze. In _Hamlet_
11239,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Shakespeare gave the public plenty that they could not understand, but"
11240,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"he made it up to them in explosions. While Hamlet, Horatio, and"
11241,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Marcellus are waiting for the Ghost, a flourish is heard, and then the"
11242,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,roar of cannon. It is the custom to fire them when the King drinks a
11243,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,pledge; and this King drinks many. In the fencing-scene at the end he
11244,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,proposes to drink one for every hit scored by his beloved nephew; and
11245,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,the first hit is duly honoured by the cannon. Unexpected events
11246,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"prevented the celebration of the second, but the audience lost nothing"
11247,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"by that. While Hamlet lies dying, a sudden explosion is heard."
11248,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Fortinbras is coming with his army. And, as if that were not enough, the"
11249,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"very last words of the play are, 'Go, bid the soldiers shoot,' and the"
11250,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,very last sound of the performance is a peal of ordnance. Into this most
11251,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"mysterious and inward of his works, it would seem, the poet flung, as if"
11252,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"in derision of his cultured critics, well-nigh every stimulant of"
11253,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"popular excitement he could collect: 'carnal, bloody, and unnatural"
11254,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"acts'; five deaths on the open stage, three appearances of a ghost, two"
11255,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"of a mad woman, a dumb-show, two men raving and fighting in a grave at a"
11256,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"funeral, the skulls and bones of the dead, a clown bandying jests with a"
11257,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"prince, songs at once indecent and pathetic, marching soldiers, a"
11258,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"fencing-match, then a litter of corpses, and explosions in the first Act"
11259,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,and explosions in the last. And yet out of this sensational
11260,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"material--not in spite of it, but out of it--he made the most mysterious"
11261,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"and inward of his dramas, which leaves us haunted by thoughts beyond the"
11262,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,reaches of our souls; and he knew that the very audience that rejoiced
11263,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"in ghosts and explosions would listen, even while it was waiting for the"
11264,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"ghost, to that which the explosion had suggested,--a general"
11265,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"disquisition, twenty-five lines long, on the manner in which one defect"
11266,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"may spoil a noble reputation. In this strange harmony of discords,"
11267,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"surely unexampled before or since, we may see at a glance the essence of"
11268,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Elizabethan drama, of its poet, and of its audience."
11269,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11270,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11271,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,2.
11272,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11273,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,We have been occupied so far with characteristics of the drama which
11274,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,reflect the more distinctively popular tastes objected to by critics
11275,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,like Jonson. We may now pass on to arrangements common to all public
11276,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"theatres, whether the play performed were Jonson's or Shakespeare's; and"
11277,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,in the first instance to a characteristic common to the public and
11278,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,private theatres alike.
11279,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11280,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"As everyone knows, the female parts in stage-plays were taken by boys,"
11281,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"youths, or men (a mask being sometimes worn in the last case). The"
11282,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,indecorous Elizabethans regarded this custom almost entirely from the
11283,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"point of view of decorum and morality. And as to morality, no one, I"
11284,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"believe, who examines the evidence, especially as it concerns the state"
11285,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,of things that followed the introduction of actresses at the
11286,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Restoration, will be very ready to dissent from their opinion. But it is"
11287,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"often assumed as a matter beyond dispute that, on the side of dramatic"
11288,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"effect, the Elizabethan practice was extremely unfortunate, if not"
11289,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"downright absurd. This idea appears to me, to say the least,"
11290,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,exaggerated. Our practice may be the better; for a few Shakespearean
11291,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"parts it _ought_ to be much better; but that, on the whole, it is"
11292,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"decidedly so, or that the old custom had anything absurd about it, there"
11293,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"seems no reason to believe. In the first place, experience in private"
11294,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,and semi-private performances shows that female parts may be excellently
11295,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"acted by youths or men, and that the most obvious drawback, that of the"
11296,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"adult male voice, is not felt to be nearly so serious as we might"
11297,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,anticipate. For a minute or two it may call for a slight exertion of
11298,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,imagination in the audience; but there is no more radical error than to
11299,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"suppose that an audience finds this irksome, or to forget that the use"
11300,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"of imagination at one point quickens it at other points, and so is a"
11301,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,positive gain. And we have further to remember that the Elizabethan
11302,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"actor of female parts was no amateur, but a professional as carefully"
11303,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,trained as an actress now; while dramatically he had this advantage over
11304,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the actress, that he was regarded simply as a player, and not also as a"
11305,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,woman with an attractive or unattractive person.[8]
11306,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11307,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"In the second place, if the current ideas on this subject were true,"
11308,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"there would be, it seems to me, more evidence of their truth. We should"
11309,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"find, for example, that when first the new fashion came in, it was hailed"
11310,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,by good judges as a very great improvement on the old. But the traces of
11311,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"such an opinion appear very scanty and doubtful, while it is certain that"
11312,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,one of the few actors who after the Restoration still played female parts
11313,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"maintained a high reputation and won great applause. Again, if these"
11314,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"parts in Shakespeare's day were very inadequately performed, would not"
11315,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,the effect of that fact be distinctly visible in the plays themselves?
11316,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"The rôles in question would be less important in Shakespeare's dramas,"
11317,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"for example, than in dramas of later times: but I do not see that they"
11318,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"are. Besides, in the Shakespearean play itself the female parts would be"
11319,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,much less important than the male: but on the whole they are not. In the
11320,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"tragedies and histories, it is true, the impelling forces of the action"
11321,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,usually belong in larger measure to men than to women. But that is
11322,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,because the action in such plays is laid in the sphere of public life;
11323,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"and in cases where, in spite of this, the heroine is as prominent as the"
11324,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"hero, her part--the part of Juliet, Cleopatra, Lady Macbeth--certainly"
11325,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"requires as good acting as his. As to the comedies, if we ask ourselves"
11326,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"who are the central or the most interesting figures in them, we shall"
11327,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,find that we pronounce a woman's name at least as often as a man's. I
11328,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,understate the case. Of Shakespeare's mature comedies the _Merchant of
11329,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Venice_, I believe, is the only one where this name would unquestionably"
11330,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"be a man's, and in three of the last five it would almost certainly be a"
11331,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"woman's--Isabella's, Imogen's, Hermione's. How shall we reconcile with"
11332,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"these facts the idea that in his day the female parts were, on the whole,"
11333,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"much less adequately played than the male? And finally, if the dramatists"
11334,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"themselves believed this, why do we not find frequent indications of the"
11335,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"belief in their prologues, epilogues, prefaces, and plays?[9]"
11336,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11337,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"We must conclude, it would seem, that the absence of actresses from the"
11338,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Elizabethan theatre, though at first it may appear to us highly"
11339,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"important, made no great difference to the dramas themselves."
11340,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11341,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11342,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,3.
11343,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11344,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,That certainly cannot be said of the construction and arrangements of
11345,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the stage. On this subject a great deal has been written of late years,"
11346,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,and as regards many details there is still much difference of
11347,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,opinion.[10] But fortunately all that is of great moment for our present
11348,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"purpose is tolerably certain. In trying to bring it out, I will begin by"
11349,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"reminding you of our present stage. For it is the stage, and not the"
11350,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"rest of the theatre, that is of special interest here; and no serious"
11351,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"harm will be done if, for the rest, we imagine Shakespeare's theatre"
11352,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"with boxes, circles, and galleries like our own, though in the shape of"
11353,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"a more elongated horse-shoe than ours. We must imagine, of course, an"
11354,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"area too; but there, as we shall see, an important difference comes in."
11355,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11356,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11357,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Our present stage may be called a box with one of its sides knocked out.
11358,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Through this opening, which has an ornamental frame, we look into the"
11359,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,box. Its three upright sides (for we may ignore the bottom and the top)
11360,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"are composed of movable painted scenes, which are changed from time to"
11361,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,time during the course of the play. Before the play and after it the
11362,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"opening is blocked by a curtain, dropped from the top of the frame; and"
11363,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"this is also dropped at intervals during the performance, that the"
11364,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,scenes may be changed.
11365,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11366,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,In all these respects the Elizabethan arrangement was quite different.
11367,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,The stage came forward to about the middle of the area; so that a line
11368,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"bisecting the house would have coincided with the line of footlights, if"
11369,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,there had been such things. The stage was therefore a platform viewed
11370,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"from both sides and not only from the front; and along its sides, as"
11371,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"well as in front of it, stood the people who paid least, the"
11372,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"groundlings, sometimes punningly derided by dramatists as 'the men of"
11373,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"understanding.' Obviously, the sides of this platform were open; nor"
11374,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,were there movable scenes even at the back of it; nor was there any
11375,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"front curtain. It was overshadowed by a projecting roof; but the area,"
11376,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"or 'yard,' where the groundlings stood, was open to the weather, and"
11377,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"accordingly the theatre could not be darkened. It will be seen that,"
11378,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"when the actors were on the forward part of the stage, they were (to"
11379,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"exaggerate a little) in the middle of the audience, like the performers"
11380,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,in a circus now. And on this forward naked part of the stage most of a
11381,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Shakespearean drama was played. We may call it the main or front
11382,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,stage.[11]
11383,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11384,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"If now we look towards the rear of this stage, what do we find? In the"
11385,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"first place, while the back of our present-day box consists of a"
11386,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"movable scene, that of the Elizabethan stage was formed by the"
11387,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"'tiring-house,' or dressing-room, of the actors. In its wall were two"
11388,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"doors, by which entrances and exits were made. But it was not merely a"
11389,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"tiring-house. In the play it might represent a room, a house, a castle,"
11390,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the wall of a town; and the doors played their parts accordingly. Again,"
11391,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"when a person speaks 'from within,' that doubtless means that he is in"
11392,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the tiring-house, opens one of the doors a little, and speaks through"
11393,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,the chink. So apparently did the prompter.
11394,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11395,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Secondly, on the top of the tiring-house was the 'upper stage' or"
11396,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"'balcony,' which looked down on the platform stage. It is hardly"
11397,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,possible to make brief statements about it that would be secure. For our
11398,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,purposes it may be imagined as a balcony jutting forward a little from
11399,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the line of the tiring-house; and it will suffice to add that, though"
11400,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the whole or part of it was on some occasions, or in some theatres,"
11401,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"occupied by spectators, the whole or part of it was sometimes used by"
11402,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,the actors and was indispensably requisite to the performance of the
11403,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,play. 'Enter above' or 'enter aloft' means that the actor was to appear
11404,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"on this upper stage or balcony. Usually, no doubt, he reached it by a"
11405,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,ladder or stair inside the tiring-house; but on occasions there were
11406,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"ascents or descents directly from, or to, the main stage, as we see from"
11407,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,'climbs the tree and is received above' or 'the citizens leap from the
11408,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,walls.' The reader of Shakespeare will at once remember many scenes
11409,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"where the balcony was used. On it, as the city wall, appeared the"
11410,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Governor and citizens of Harfleur, while King Henry and his train stood"
11411,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,before the gates below. From it Arthur made his fatal leap. It was
11412,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Cleopatra's monument, into which she and her women drew up the dying"
11413,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Antony. Juliet talked to Romeo from it; and from it Romeo ('one kiss and
11414,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,I'll descend') 'goeth down' to the main stage. Richard appeared there
11415,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,between the two bishops; and there the spectators imagined Duncan
11416,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,murdered in his sleep.[12] But they could not look into his chamber. The
11417,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"balcony could be concealed by curtains, running, like all Elizabethan"
11418,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"stage curtains, on a rod."
11419,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11420,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"In the third place, there was, towards the back of the main stage, a"
11421,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"part that could be curtained off, and so separated from the front part"
11422,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,of that stage. Let us call it the back stage. It is the matter about
11423,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,which there is most difficulty and controversy; but the general
11424,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,description just given would be accepted by almost all scholars and will
11425,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"suffice for us. Here was the curtain (more strictly, the curtains)"
11426,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"through which the actors peeped at the audience before the play began,"
11427,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,and at which the groundlings hurled apples and other missiles to hasten
11428,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,their coming or signify disapproval of them. And this 'back stage' was
11429,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"essential to many performances, and was used in a variety of ways. It"
11430,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,was the room where Henry IV. lay dying; the cave of Timon or of
11431,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Belarius; probably the tent in which Richmond slept before the battle of
11432,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Bosworth; the cell of Prospero, who draws the curtains apart and shows"
11433,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Ferdinand and Miranda playing at chess within; and here, I imagine, and"
11434,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"not on the balcony, Juliet, after drinking the potion, 'falls upon her"
11435,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"bed within the curtains.'[13] Finally, the back stage accounts for those"
11436,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"passages where, at the close of a death-scene, there is no indication"
11437,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,that the corpse was carried off the stage. If the death took place on
11438,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the open stage, as it usually did, this of course was necessary, since"
11439,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,there was no front curtain to drop; and so we usually find in the
11440,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"dialogue words like 'Take up the bodies' (_Hamlet_), or 'Bear them from"
11441,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,hence' (_King Lear_). But Desdemona was murdered in her bed on the back
11442,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,stage; and there died also Othello and Emilia; so that Lodovico orders
11443,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the bodies to be 'hid,' not carried off. The curtains were drawn"
11444,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"together, and the dead actors withdrew into the tiring-house unseen,[14]"
11445,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,while the living went off openly.
11446,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11447,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,This triple stage is the primary thing to remember about Shakespeare's
11448,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"theatre: a platform coming well forward into the yard, completely open"
11449,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"in the larger front part, but having further back a part that could be"
11450,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"curtained off, and overlooked by an upper stage or balcony above the"
11451,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,tiring-house. Only a few further details need be mentioned. Though
11452,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"scenery was unknown, there were plenty of properties, as may be gathered"
11453,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"from the dramas and, more quickly, from the accounts of Henslowe, the"
11454,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"manager of the Rose. Chairs, benches, and tables are a matter of course."
11455,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Kent sat in the stocks. The witches had a caldron. Imogen slept in a
11456,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"bed, and Iachimo crept out of his trunk in her room. Falstaff was"
11457,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,carried off the stage in a clothes-basket. I have quoted the direction
11458,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"'climb the tree.' A 'banquet' figures in Henslowe's list, and in the"
11459,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"_Tempest_ 'several strange shapes' bring one in. He mentions a 'tomb,'"
11460,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"and it is possible, though not likely, that the tomb of the Capulets was"
11461,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"a property; and he mentions a 'moss-bank,' doubtless such as that where"
11462,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the wild thyme was blowing for Titania. Her lover, you remember, wore an"
11463,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"ass's head, and the Falstaff of the _Merry Wives_ a buck's. There were"
11464,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"whole animals, too. 'A great horse with his legs' is in Henslowe's"
11465,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,list; and in a play not by Shakespeare Jonah is cast out of the whale's
11466,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,belly on to the stage. Besides these properties there was a contrivance
11467,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"with ropes and pulleys, by which a heavenly being could descend from the"
11468,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"stage-roof (the 'heaven'), as in _Cymbeline_ Jupiter descends upon his"
11469,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,eagle. When his speech is over we find the direction 'ascends.' Soon
11470,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,after comes another direction: 'vanish.' This is addressed not to
11471,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Jupiter but to various ghosts who are present. For there was a hollow
11472,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"space under the stage, and a trap-door into it. Through this ghosts"
11473,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,usually made their entrances and exits; and 'vanish' seems commonly to
11474,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"mean an exit that way. Through it, too, arose and sank the witches'"
11475,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,caldron and the apparitions shown to Macbeth. A person could speak from
11476,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"under the stage, as the Ghost does when Hamlet calls him 'old mole'; and"
11477,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the musicians could go and play there, as they do in the scene where"
11478,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Antony's soldiers hear strange music on the night before the battle;
11479,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,'Musicke of the Hoboyes is under the Stage' the direction runs
11480,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,('Hoboyes' were used also in the witch-scene just mentioned).
11481,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11482,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11483,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,4.
11484,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11485,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,We have now to observe certain ways in which this stage with its
11486,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,arrangements influenced the dramas themselves; and we shall find that
11487,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,the majority of these influences are connected with the absence of
11488,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"scenery. In this, to begin with, lies the main, though not the whole,"
11489,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,explanation of the shortness of the performance. In our Shakespeare
11490,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"revivals the drama is always considerably cut down; and yet, even where"
11491,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"no excessive prominence is given to scenic display, the time occupied is"
11492,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"seldom less than three hours, and often a good deal more. In"
11493,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Shakespeare's day, as we gather from various sources (_e.g._ from the"
11494,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Prologues to _Romeo and Juliet_ and _Henry VIII._), the customary time"
11495,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,taken by the un-shortened play was about two hours. And the chief reason
11496,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,of this great difference obviously is that the time which we spend in
11497,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,setting and changing scenes his company spent in acting the piece. At a
11498,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,given signal certain characters appeared. Unless a placard announced the
11499,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"place where they were supposed to be,[15] the audience gathered this"
11500,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"from their conversation, or in the absence of such indications asked no"
11501,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,questions on the subject. They talked for a time and went away; and at
11502,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,once another set appeared. The intervals between the acts (if intervals
11503,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"there were, and however they were occupied) had no purpose connected"
11504,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"with scene-changing, and must have been short; and the introduction and"
11505,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,removal of a few properties would take next to no time from the
11506,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,performance.[16] We may safely assume that not less than a hundred of
11507,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,the hundred and twenty minutes were given to the play itself.
11508,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11509,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"The absence of scenery, however, will not wholly account for the"
11510,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,difference in question. If you take a Shakespearean play of average
11511,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"length and read it at about the pace usual in our revivals, you will"
11512,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"find, I think, that you have occupied considerably more than a hundred"
11513,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,or a hundred and twenty minutes.[17] The Elizabethan actor can hardly
11514,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"have spoken so slowly. Probably the position of the stage, and"
11515,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"especially of the front part of it where most of the action took place,"
11516,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,was of advantage to him in this respect. Standing almost in the middle
11517,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"of his audience, and at no great distance from any section of it, he"
11518,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,could with safety deliver his lines much faster than an actor can now.
11519,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,He could speak even a 'passionate' speech 'trippingly on the tongue.'
11520,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Hamlet bids him do so, warns him not to mouth, and, when the time for"
11521,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"his speech comes, calls impatiently to him to leave his damnable faces"
11522,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,and begin; and this is not the only passage in Elizabethan literature
11523,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,which suggests that good judges objected to a slow and over-emphatic
11524,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"delivery. We have some actors not inferior in elocution, we must"
11525,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"presume, to Burbage or Taylor, but even Mr. Vezin or Mr. Forbes"
11526,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Robertson may find it difficult to deliver blank verse intelligibly,"
11527,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"musically, and rapidly out of our stage-box.[18]"
11528,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11529,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"I return to the absence of scenery, which even in this matter must be"
11530,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,more important than the position of the stage or the preference for
11531,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"rapid speech. It explains, secondly, the great difference between"
11532,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Elizabethan and more modern plays in the number of the scenes.[19] This
11533,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"number, with Shakespeare, averages somewhere about twenty: it reaches"
11534,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"forty-two in _Antony and Cleopatra_, and sinks to nine in _Love's"
11535,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Labour's Lost_, the _Midsummer-Night's Dream_, and the _Tempest_. In the"
11536,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"fourth act of the first of these plays there are thirteen scenes, no one"
11537,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,of them in the same place as the next. The average number in Schiller's
11538,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,plays seems to be about eight. In plays written now it corresponds not
11539,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,unfrequently with the number of acts.[20] The primary cause of this
11540,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"difference, though not the only one, is, I presume, that we expect to"
11541,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"see appropriate surroundings, at the least, for every part of the"
11542,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"story. Such surroundings mean more or less elaborate scenery, which,"
11543,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"besides being expensive, takes a long time to set and change. For a"
11544,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,dramatist accordingly who is a dramatist and wishes to hold his audience
11545,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"by the play itself, it is an advantage to have as few scenes as may be."
11546,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"And so the absence of scenery in Shakespeare's day, and its presence in"
11547,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"ours, result in two totally different systems, not merely of theatrical"
11548,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"effect, but of dramatic construction."
11549,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11550,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,In certain ways it was clearly an advantage to a playwright to be able
11551,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"to produce a large number of scenes, varying in length according to his"
11552,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"pleasure, and separated by almost inappreciable intervals. Nor could"
11553,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"there be any disadvantage in this freedom, if he had a strong feeling"
11554,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"for dramatic construction, and a gift for it, and a determination to"
11555,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"construct as well as he could. But, as a matter of fact, many, perhaps"
11556,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the majority, of the pre-Shakespearean dramas are put together very"
11557,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,loosely; scene follows scene in the manner of a casual narrative rather
11558,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,than a play; and a good deal is admitted for the sake of its immediate
11559,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,attraction and not because it is essential to the plot. The freedom
11560,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"which we are considering, though it could not necessitate these defects,"
11561,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,gave the widest scope for them; the majority of the audience probably
11562,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"was, and continued to be, well-nigh indifferent to them; and a large"
11563,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,proportion of the plays of Shakespeare's time exhibits them in some
11564,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,degree. The average drama of that day has great merits of a strictly
11565,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"dramatic kind, but it is not well-built, it is not what we mean by 'a"
11566,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,good play'; and if we look at it from the restricted point of view
11567,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"implied by that phrase we shall be inclined, I think, to believe that it"
11568,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,would have been a better play if its author had been compelled by the
11569,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,stage-arrangements to halve the number of the scenes. These remarks will
11570,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"hold of Shakespeare himself. Some of his most delightful dramas,"
11571,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"indeed,--for instance, the two Parts of _Henry IV._--make little or no"
11572,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,pretence to be well-constructed wholes; and even in those which fully
11573,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,deserve that title a certain amount of matter not indispensable to the
11574,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,plot is usually to be found. In point of construction _Othello_ is the
11575,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"best of his tragedies, _Julius Cæsar_ better than _King Lear_, and"
11576,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,_Antony and Cleopatra_ perhaps the faultiest. To say that this depends
11577,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"solely on the number of scenes would be ridiculous, but still it is"
11578,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"probably significant that the numbers are, respectively, fifteen,"
11579,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"eighteen, twenty-one, and forty-two."
11580,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11581,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"The average Elizabethan play could not, of course, have been converted"
11582,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,into a well-built fabric by a _mere_ reduction of the number of its
11583,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,scenes; and in some cases no amount of rearrangement of the whole
11584,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"material employed could have produced this result. This means, however,"
11585,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"on the other hand, that the Elizabethans, partly from the very"
11586,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"simplicity of their theatrical conditions, were able to handle with"
11587,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"decided, though usually imperfect, dramatic effect subjects which would"
11588,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"present difficulties still greater, if not insuperable, to a playwright"
11589,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"now. And in Shakespeare we can trace, in this respect and in others, the"
11590,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,advantages connected with the absence of scenery. He could carry his
11591,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"audience freely from one country, town, house or room, to another, or"
11592,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"from this part of a battle-field to that, because the audience imagined"
11593,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,each place and saw none. I take an extreme example. The Third Act of
11594,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"_Antony and Cleopatra_, according to modern editions, contains thirteen"
11595,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"scenes, and these are the localities assigned to them: (1) a plain in"
11596,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Syria, (2) Rome, an ante-chamber in Cæsar's house, (3) Alexandria,"
11597,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Cleopatra's palace, (4) Athens, a room in Antony's house, (5) the same,"
11598,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"another room, (6) Rome, Cæsar's house, (7) near Actium, Antony's camp,"
11599,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"(8) a plain near Actium, (9) another part of the plain, (10) another"
11600,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"part of the plain, (11) Alexandria, Cleopatra's palace, (12) Egypt,"
11601,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Cæsar's camp, (13) Alexandria, Cleopatra's palace. I wonder how long"
11602,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"this Act would take on our stage, where each locality must be"
11603,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"represented. Three hours perhaps, of which the performance might occupy"
11604,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,one-eighth. But in Shakespeare's day there was no occasion for any
11605,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,stage-direction as to locality throughout the Act.
11606,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11607,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Again, Shakespeare's method of working a double plot depends largely on"
11608,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,his ability to bring the persons belonging to the two plots on to the
11609,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,stage in alternate scenes of no great length until the threads are
11610,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"combined. This is easily seen in _King Lear_; and there we can observe,"
11611,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"further, how he varies the pitch of feeling and provides relief by"
11612,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,interposing short quiet scenes between longer exciting ones. By this
11613,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"means, as I have pointed out elsewhere, the Storm-scene on the heath,"
11614,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"which if undivided would be intolerable, is broken into three, separated"
11615,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"by very short duologues spoken within the Castle and in prose. Again,"
11616,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"since scene follows scene without a pause, he could make one tell on"
11617,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,another in the way either of intensification or of contrast. We catch
11618,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the effect in reading, but in our theatres it is usually destroyed by"
11619,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the interval. Finally, however many scenes an Act may contain,"
11620,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Shakespeare can keep attention glued to the play throughout the Act,"
11621,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"because there are no intervals. So can our playwrights, because they"
11622,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,have but one or two scenes in the Act. But in our reproductions of
11623,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Shakespeare, though the number of scenes is reduced, it can scarcely"
11624,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"ever be reduced to that extent; so that several times during an Act, and"
11625,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"many times during the play, we are withdrawn perforce from the dramatic"
11626,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"atmosphere into that of everyday life, solitary impatience or ennui,"
11627,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"distracting conversation, third-rate music, or, occasionally, good music"
11628,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,half-drowned in a babble of voices.
11629,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11630,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"If we consider the characteristics on which I have been dwelling, and"
11631,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,bear in mind also the rapidity of speech which we have found to be
11632,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"probable, we shall realise that a performance in Shakespeare's day,"
11633,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"though more of the play was performed, must have been something much"
11634,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"more variegated and changeful, and much lighter in movement, than a"
11635,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,revival now. And this difference will have been observed by those who
11636,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"have seen Shakespeare acted by the Elizabethan Stage Society, under the"
11637,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"direction of Mr. Poel, who not only played scene after scene without"
11638,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"intervals, but secured in a considerable degree that rapidity of speech."
11639,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11640,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"A minor point remains. The Elizabethan stage, we have seen, had no front"
11641,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,curtain. The front curtain and the use of scenery naturally came in
11642,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"together, for the second, so far as the front stage was concerned, was"
11643,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,dependent on the first; and as we have already glanced at some effects
11644,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"of the absence of the second, that of the first will require but a few"
11645,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,additional words. It was clearly in some ways a great disadvantage; for
11646,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,every situation at the front of the stage had to be begun and ended
11647,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,before the eyes of the audience. In our dramas the curtain may rise on a
11648,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,position which the actors then had to produce by movements not really
11649,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"belonging to the play; and, what is more important, the scene may"
11650,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"advance to a striking climax, the effect of which would be greatly"
11651,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,diminished and sometimes destroyed if the actors had to leave the stage
11652,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"instead of being suddenly hidden. In Elizabethan plays, accordingly, we"
11653,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"seldom meet with this kind of effect, though it is not difficult to"
11654,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,discover places where it would have been appropriate. But we shall not
11655,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"find them, I venture to think, in tragedies. This effect, in other"
11656,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"words, appears properly to belong to comedy and to melodrama (if that"
11657,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,species of play is to be considered here at all); and the Elizabethans
11658,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"lost nothing by their inability to misuse it in tragedy, and especially"
11659,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,at the close of a tragedy. Whether it can be artistic to end any
11660,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"serious scene whatever at the point of greatest tension seems doubtful,"
11661,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,but surely it is little short of barbarous to drop the curtain on the
11662,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"last dying words, or, it may be, the last convulsion, of a tragic hero."
11663,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"In tragedy the Elizabethan practice, like the Greek, was to lower the"
11664,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"pitch of emotion from this point by a few quiet words, followed perhaps"
11665,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"by sounds which, in intention at least, were majestic or solemn, and so"
11666,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"to restore the audience to common life 'in calm of mind, all passion"
11667,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,spent.' Thus Shakespeare's tragedies always close; and the end of
11668,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Marlowe's _Doctor Faustus_ is not _Exeunt Devils with Faustus_, but the"
11669,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,speech beginning
11670,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11671,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight,"
11672,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"And burned is Apollo's laurel-bough,"
11673,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,That sometime grew within this learned man.
11674,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11675,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"In this particular case Marlowe, if he had not been a poet, might have"
11676,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"dispensed with the final descent, or ascent, from the violent emotions"
11677,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,attending the catastrophe; but in the immense majority of their
11678,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"tragedies the Elizabethans, even if they had wished to do as we too"
11679,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"often do, were saved from the temptation by the absence of a front"
11680,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,curtain.[21]
11681,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11682,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11683,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,5.
11684,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11685,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Hitherto we have not considered a Shakespearean performance on the side,"
11686,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"I will not say of its spectacular, but of its pictorial effect. This"
11687,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,must be our last subject. We have to bear in mind here three things: the
11688,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"fact that the stage was viewed from three sides, its illumination by"
11689,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"daylight throughout the play, and the absence of scenery. It is obvious"
11690,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,that the last two deprived the audience of many attractive or impressive
11691,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"pictures; while, as to the first, it seems unlikely that actors who were"
11692,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,watched from the sides as well as the front would study to group
11693,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,themselves as parts of a composition addressed to the eye. Indeed one
11694,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"may doubt whether, except in regard to costume, they seriously attended"
11695,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"to the pictorial effect of a drama at all; their tiny crowds and armies,"
11696,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"for example, cannot have provided much of a show. And in any case it is"
11697,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,clear that the audience had to dispense with many more or less beautiful
11698,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"sights that we may now enjoy. But the question whether their loss was,"
11699,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"on the whole, a disadvantage is not so easy to answer; for here again it"
11700,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,freed them from a temptation--that of sacrificing dramatic to pictorial
11701,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"effect; and we cannot tell whether, or how far, they would have been"
11702,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"proof against its influence. Let us try, however, to see the position"
11703,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,clearly.
11704,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11705,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,The essence of drama--and certainly of Shakespearean drama--lies in
11706,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,actions and words expressive of inward movements of human nature.
11707,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Pictorial effects (if for convenience' sake the various matters under
11708,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,consideration may be signified by that phrase) are in themselves no more
11709,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"dramatic than songs, dances, military music, or the jests of a 'fool.'"
11710,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Like these other things, they may be made dramatic. They may be used and"
11711,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"apprehended, that is to say, as elements fused with the essential"
11712,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"elements of dramatic effect. And, so far as this is the case and they"
11713,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"thus contribute to that effect, they are, it seems clear, an unmixed"
11714,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,advantage. But a distinct and separate attention to them is another
11715,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"matter; for, the moment it sets in, attention begins to be withdrawn"
11716,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"from the actions and words, and therefore from the inward movements that"
11717,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"these express. And experience shows that, as soon as pictorial"
11718,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"attractions exceed a certain limit, impossible to specify in general"
11719,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"terms, they at once influence the average play-goer in this mischievous"
11720,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"way. It is, further, well-nigh inevitable that this should happen."
11721,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"However interesting the actions, words, and inward movements may be,"
11722,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,they call for some effort of imagination and of other mental
11723,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"activities,[22] while stage-pictures demand very little; and"
11724,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"accordingly, at the present time at any rate, the bulk of an audience to"
11725,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,which the latter are abundantly presented will begin to enjoy them for
11726,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"their own sakes, or as parts of a panorama and not of a drama. No one, I"
11727,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"think, can honestly doubt this who watches and listens to the people"
11728,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,sitting near him at what the newspapers too truly call 'an amazing
11729,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Shakespearean spectacle.' If we are offered a pretty picture of the
11730,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"changing colours of the sky at dawn, or of a forest glade with deer"
11731,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"miraculously moving across its sunny grass, most of us cease for the"
11732,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,time to be an audience and become mere spectators; and let Romeo and
11733,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Juliet, or Rosalind and Orlando, talk as like angels as they will, they"
11734,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,will talk but half-heeded. Our dramatists know this well enough. Mr.
11735,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Barrie and Mr. Pinero and Mr. Shaw, who want the audience to listen and"
11736,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"understand, take good care not to divert its attention and deaden its"
11737,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"imagination by scenic displays. And yet, with the heartiest admiration"
11738,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"for their best work, one may say that Shakespeare's requires more"
11739,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,attention and imagination than theirs.
11740,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11741,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Whether the Elizabethan companies, if they had had the power to use the"
11742,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"attractions of scenery, would have abused it, and whether in that case"
11743,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"the audience would have been as readily debauched as ours, it is useless"
11744,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,to dispute. The audience was not composed mainly of groundlings; and
11745,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,even the groundlings in that age had drama in their blood. But I venture
11746,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"to disbelieve that the main fault in these matters lies, in any age,"
11747,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"with the audience. It is like the populace in Shakespeare's plays, easy"
11748,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,to lead wrong but just as easy to lead right. If you give people in the
11749,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"East End, or even in the Albert Hall, nothing but third-rate music, most"
11750,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"of them will be content with it, and possibly may come to disrelish what"
11751,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,is better. But if you have a little faith in great art and in human
11752,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"nature, and offer them, I do not say the Diabelli variations, but such"
11753,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"music as the symphonies of Beethoven or even of Brahms, they will"
11754,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"justify your faith. This is not theory, but fact; and I cannot think"
11755,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"that it is otherwise with drama, or at least with the dramas of"
11756,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Shakespeare. Did they ever 'spell ruin to managers' if they were,"
11757,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"through the whole cast, satisfactorily acted? What spells real ruin to"
11758,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,managers and actors alike is what spells degradation to audiences.[23]
11759,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11760,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,But whether or no Shakespeare's audience could have been easily degraded
11761,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"by scenic pleasure, it had not the chance; and I will not raise the"
11762,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"further question how far its disabilities were the cause of its virtues,"
11763,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,but will end with a few words on two of the virtues themselves. It
11764,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"possessed, first, a vivid imagination. Shakespeare could address to it"
11765,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"not in vain the injunction, 'Work, work your thoughts!' Probably in"
11766,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,three scenes out of five the place and surroundings of the action were
11767,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,absolutely invisible to its eyes. In a fourth it took the barest symbol
11768,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"for reality. A couple of wretched trees made the Forest of Arden for it,"
11769,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,five men with ragged foils the army that conquered at Agincourt: are we
11770,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"stronger than it, or weaker? It heard Romeo say"
11771,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11772,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Look, love, what envious streaks"
11773,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east;
11774,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11775,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,and to its mind's eye they were there. It looked at a shabby old
11776,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"balcony, but as it listened it saw the swallows flitting round the"
11777,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"sun-lit battlements of Macbeth's castle, and our pitiful sense of"
11778,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,grotesque incongruity never troubled it.[24] The simplest convention
11779,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,sufficed to set its imagination at work. If Prospero entered wearing a
11780,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"particular robe, it knew that no one on the stage could see his solid"
11781,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"shape;[25] and if Banquo, rising through the trap-door, had his bloody"
11782,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"face dusted over with meal, it recognised him for a ghost and thrilled"
11783,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"with horror; and we, Heaven help us, should laugh. Though the stage"
11784,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"stood in broad daylight, again, Banquo, for it, was being murdered on a"
11785,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"dark wet night, for he carried a torch and spoke of rain; and the"
11786,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,chaste stars were shining for it outside Desdemona's chamber as the
11787,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,awful figure entered and extinguished the lamp. Consider how
11788,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"extraordinary is the fact I am about to mention, and what a testimony it"
11789,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"bears to the imagination of the audience. In _Hamlet_, _Othello_, and"
11790,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"_Macbeth_, not one scene here and there but actually the majority of the"
11791,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"most impressive scenes take place at night, and, to a reader, depend not"
11792,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"a little on the darkness for their effect. Yet the Ghost-scenes, the"
11793,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"play-scene, the sparing of the king at prayer, that conversation of"
11794,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Hamlet with his mother which is opened by the killing of Polonius and
11795,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"interrupted by the appearance of the Ghost; the murder of Duncan, the"
11796,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"murder of Banquo, the Banquet-scene, the Sleep-walking scene; the whole"
11797,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"of the first Act of _Othello_, the scene of Cassio's drunken revel and"
11798,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"fight, and the whole of the terrible last Act,--all of this was played"
11799,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"in a theatre open to the afternoon sun, and was written by a man who"
11800,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,knew that it was so to be played. But he knew his audience too.[26]
11801,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,
11802,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"That audience had not only imagination, and the power to sink its soul"
11803,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,in the essence of drama. It had something else of scarcely less import
11804,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"for Shakespeare, the love of poetry. Ignorant, noisy, malodorous, too"
11805,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"fond of dances and songs and dirty jokes, of soldiers and trumpets and"
11806,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"cannon, the groundling might be: but he liked poetry. If he had not"
11807,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"liked it, he, with his brutal manners, would have silenced it, and the"
11808,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,Elizabethan drama could never have been the thing it was. The plays of
11809,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Shakespeare swarm with long speeches, almost all of which are cut down"
11810,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"or cut clean away for our theatres. They are never, of course,"
11811,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,irrelevant; sometimes they are indispensable to the full appreciation
11812,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,of a character; but it is manifest that they were not written solely
11813,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"for a dramatic purpose, but also because the author and his audience"
11814,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,loved poetry. A sign of this is the fact that they especially abound
11815,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"where, from the nature of the story, the dramatic structure is"
11816,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,imperfect.[27] They abound in _Troilus and Cressida_ and _Henry V._ more
11817,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"than in _Othello_ or _Much Ado_. Remember, for a standard of size, that"
11818,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"'To be or not to be' is thirty-three lines in length, and then consider"
11819,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,the following fact. _Henry V._ contains seventeen speeches longer than
11820,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"that soliloquy. Five of them are between forty and fifty lines long, two"
11821,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"between fifty and sixty, and two exceed sixty. Yet if any play entirely"
11822,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,by Shakespeare were open to the charge of being a 'drum and trumpet
11823,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"history' written to please the populace, it would be _Henry V._ Not only"
11824,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,then the cultured section of the audience loved poetry; the whole
11825,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,audience loved it. How long would they have continued to relish this
11826,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,'perpetual feast of nectared sweets' if their eyes had been feasted too?
11827,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,"Or is it likely that, once habituated to spectacular stimulants, they"
11828,SHAKESPEARE'S THEATRE AND AUDIENCE.,would have welcomed 'the crystal clearness of the Muses' spring'?

11838,FOOTNOTES:,(Preface to the _White Devil_).

11845,FOOTNOTES:,his plays would be much more free from blemishes of various kinds if
11846,FOOTNOTES:,his audience had added to their virtues greater cultivation. On the
11847,FOOTNOTES:,"other hand the question whether, or how far, he knowingly 'wrote down"

11849,FOOTNOTES:,"to me very difficult, if not impossible, to answer: and I may mention"
11850,FOOTNOTES:,some causes of this difficulty.
11851,FOOTNOTES:,
11852,FOOTNOTES:,(1) There is no general presumption against interpolations in an
11853,FOOTNOTES:,Elizabethan drama published piratically or after the author's death.
11854,FOOTNOTES:,"We have, further, positive grounds of the strongest kind for"
11855,FOOTNOTES:,believing that 'Shakespeare's plays' contain a good deal that
11856,FOOTNOTES:,Shakespeare never wrote. We cannot therefore simply take it for
11857,FOOTNOTES:,granted that he wrote every silly or offensive thing that we find in
11858,FOOTNOTES:,the volume; and least of all should we do this when the passage is
11859,FOOTNOTES:,more or less irrelevant and particularly easy to excise. I do not say
11860,FOOTNOTES:,"that these considerations have great importance here, but they have"
11861,FOOTNOTES:,"some; and readers of Shakespeare, and even some scholars, constantly"
11862,FOOTNOTES:,"tend to forget them, and to regard the texts as if they had been"
11863,FOOTNOTES:,"published by himself, or by scrupulously careful men of letters"
11864,FOOTNOTES:,immediately after his death.
11865,FOOTNOTES:,
11866,FOOTNOTES:,(2) We must never take for granted that what seems to us feeble or
11867,FOOTNOTES:,bad seemed so to Shakespeare. Evidently he was amused by puns and
11868,FOOTNOTES:,quips and verbal ingenuities in which most of us find little
11869,FOOTNOTES:,"entertainment. Gross jokes, scarcely redeemed in our eyes by their"
11870,FOOTNOTES:,"humour, may have diverted him. He sometimes writes, and clearly in"
11871,FOOTNOTES:,"good faith, what seems to us bombastic or 'conceited.' So far as this"
11872,FOOTNOTES:,was the case he was not writing down to his audience. He shared its
11873,FOOTNOTES:,"tastes, or the tastes of some section of it. So it may have been,"
11874,FOOTNOTES:,"again, with such a blot as the blinding of Gloucester on the open"
11875,FOOTNOTES:,stage.
11876,FOOTNOTES:,
11877,FOOTNOTES:,"(3) Jonson defied his audience, yet he wrote a good deal that we"
11878,FOOTNOTES:,think bad. In the same way certain of Shakespeare's faults _cannot_
11879,FOOTNOTES:,be due to condescension to his audience: _e.g._ the obscurities and
11880,FOOTNOTES:,distortions of language not infrequent in his later plays. And this
11881,FOOTNOTES:,may be so with some faults which have the appearance of arising from
11882,FOOTNOTES:,that condescension.
11883,FOOTNOTES:,
11884,FOOTNOTES:,(4) Other defects again he might have deliberately defended; _e.g._
11885,FOOTNOTES:,the highly improbable conclusions and the distressing mis-marriages
11886,FOOTNOTES:,"of some of the comedies. 'It is of the essence of romantic comedy,'"
11887,FOOTNOTES:,"he might have said, 'to treat such things with indifference. There is"
11888,FOOTNOTES:,a convention that you should take the characters with some degree of
11889,FOOTNOTES:,"seriousness while they are in difficulties, and should cease to do so"
11890,FOOTNOTES:,when they are to be delivered from them.' Do not we ourselves adopt
11891,FOOTNOTES:,this point of view to some extent when we go to the theatre now?
11892,FOOTNOTES:,
11893,FOOTNOTES:,I added this note after reading Mr. Bridges's very interesting and
11894,FOOTNOTES:,original contribution to the Stratford Town edition of Shakespeare
11895,FOOTNOTES:,"(vol x.). I disagree with some of Mr. Bridges's remarks, and am not"
11896,FOOTNOTES:,always repelled by things that he dislikes. But this brief note is
11897,FOOTNOTES:,"not, of course, meant for an answer to his paper; it merely suggests"
11898,FOOTNOTES:,reasons for at least diminishing the proportion of defect

11900,FOOTNOTES:,audience.
11901,FOOTNOTES:,

11905,FOOTNOTES:,"1623, omits the soliloquy but retains the marching soldiers."

11921,FOOTNOTES:,"But, as to this matter and the other considerations put forward"
11922,FOOTNOTES:,"above, I must add that, while my impression is that what has been"
11923,FOOTNOTES:,"said of Shakespeare holds of most of the contemporary dramatists, I"
11924,FOOTNOTES:,have not verified it by a research. A student looking for a subject
11925,FOOTNOTES:,for his thesis might well undertake such a research.
11926,FOOTNOTES:,
11927,FOOTNOTES:,[10] When the lecture was given (in 1902) I went more fully into
11928,FOOTNOTES:,"details, having arrived at certain conclusions mainly by an"
11929,FOOTNOTES:,examination of Elizabethan dramas. I suppress them here because I
11930,FOOTNOTES:,have been unable to study all that has since been written on the
11931,FOOTNOTES:,Elizabethan stage. The reader who is interested in the subject should
11932,FOOTNOTES:,refer in the first instance to an excellent article by Mr. Archer in
11933,FOOTNOTES:,"the _Quarterly Review_ for April, 1908."
11934,FOOTNOTES:,
11935,FOOTNOTES:,"[11] This is a description of a public theatre. A private one, it"
11936,FOOTNOTES:,"will be remembered, had seats in the area (there called the pit), was"
11937,FOOTNOTES:,"completely roofed, and could be darkened."
11938,FOOTNOTES:,
11939,FOOTNOTES:,"[12] 'The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms Do mock their"
11940,FOOTNOTES:,"charge with snores,' says Lady Macbeth on the stage below; and no"
11941,FOOTNOTES:,doubt the tiring-house doors _were_ open.
11942,FOOTNOTES:,
11943,FOOTNOTES:,"[13] This view, into the grounds of which I cannot go, implies that"
11944,FOOTNOTES:,"Juliet's bedroom was, in one scene, the upper stage, and, in another,"
11945,FOOTNOTES:,"the back stage; but the Elizabethans, I believe, would make no"
11946,FOOTNOTES:,difficulty about that.
11947,FOOTNOTES:,
11948,FOOTNOTES:,[14] Perhaps. It seems necessary to suppose that the sides of the
11949,FOOTNOTES:,"backstage, as well as its front, could be open; otherwise many of the"
11950,FOOTNOTES:,spectators could not have seen what took place there. But it is not
11951,FOOTNOTES:,"_necessary_, so far as I remember, to suppose that the sides could be"
11952,FOOTNOTES:,closed by curtains. The Elizabethans probably would not have been
11953,FOOTNOTES:,troubled by seeing dead bodies get up and go into the tiring-house
11954,FOOTNOTES:,when a play or even a scene was over.
11955,FOOTNOTES:,
11956,FOOTNOTES:,[15] Where this contrivance was used at all it probably only
11957,FOOTNOTES:,announced the general place of the action throughout the play: _e.g._
11958,FOOTNOTES:,"_Denmark_, or, a little more fully, _Verona_, _Mantua_."
11959,FOOTNOTES:,
11960,FOOTNOTES:,"[16] It is possibly significant that _Macbeth_ and the _Tempest_,"
11961,FOOTNOTES:,"plays containing more 'shews' than most, are exceptionally short."
11962,FOOTNOTES:,
11963,FOOTNOTES:,[17] It suffices for this rough experiment to read a column in an
11964,FOOTNOTES:,"edition like the Globe, and then to multiply the time taken by the"
11965,FOOTNOTES:,number of columns in the play.
11966,FOOTNOTES:,
11967,FOOTNOTES:,[18] I do not know whether the average size of our theatres differs
11968,FOOTNOTES:,much from that of the Elizabethan. The diameter of the area at the
11969,FOOTNOTES:,_Fortune_ and the _Globe_ seems to have been fifty feet.
11970,FOOTNOTES:,
11971,FOOTNOTES:,[19] I mean by a scene a section of a play before and after which the
11972,FOOTNOTES:,stage is unoccupied. Most editions of Shakespeare are faulty in the
11973,FOOTNOTES:,"division of scenes (see _Shakespearean Tragedy_, p. 451)."
11974,FOOTNOTES:,
11975,FOOTNOTES:,[20] So it very nearly does in some Restoration comedies. In the _Way
11976,FOOTNOTES:,"of the World_ the scenery is changed only twice in the five acts,"
11977,FOOTNOTES:,though there are more than five scenes.
11978,FOOTNOTES:,
11979,FOOTNOTES:,"[21] The 'back' stage, which had curtains, must, I suppose, have been"
11980,FOOTNOTES:,"too small to accommodate the number of persons commonly present,"
11981,FOOTNOTES:,"alive or dead, at the close of a tragedy. I do not know if any recent"
11982,FOOTNOTES:,writer has raised and discussed the questions how often the back
11983,FOOTNOTES:,"stage is used in the last scene of an Elizabethan play, and, again,"
11984,FOOTNOTES:,"whether it is often employed at all in order to produce, by the"
11985,FOOTNOTES:,"closing of the curtains, the kind of effect referred to in the"
11986,FOOTNOTES:,paragraph above. Perhaps the fact that the curtains had to be closed
11987,FOOTNOTES:,"by an actor, within them or without, made this effect impossible. Or"
11988,FOOTNOTES:,"perhaps it was not desired. In Shakespeare's tragedies, if my memory"
11989,FOOTNOTES:,"serves me, the only sudden or startling appeals of an outward kind"
11990,FOOTNOTES:,"(apart, of course, from actions) are those produced by supernatural"
11991,FOOTNOTES:,"appearances and disappearances, as in _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_. These,"
11992,FOOTNOTES:,"we have seen, were usually managed by means of the trap-door, which,"
11993,FOOTNOTES:,"it would seem from some passages, must have been rather large. These"
11994,FOOTNOTES:,matters deserve investigation if they have not already received it.
11995,FOOTNOTES:,
11996,FOOTNOTES:,[22] I do not refer to such deliberate and sustained effort as a
11997,FOOTNOTES:,reader may sometimes make. It is not commonly realised that
11998,FOOTNOTES:,"continuous attention to any imaginative or intellectual matter,"
11999,FOOTNOTES:,"however enjoyable, involves considerable strain. If at a lecture or"
12000,FOOTNOTES:,sermon a careless person makes himself observable in arriving late or
12001,FOOTNOTES:,"leaving early, the eyes of half the audience will turn to him and"
12002,FOOTNOTES:,follow him. And the reason is not always that the speaker bores them;
12003,FOOTNOTES:,it is that involuntarily they seek relief from this strain. The same
12004,FOOTNOTES:,"thing may be seen in the concert-room or theatre, but very much less"
12005,FOOTNOTES:,"at a panorama, because the mere use of the eyes, even when"

12008,FOOTNOTES:,"[23] I am not referring here, or elsewhere, to such a moderate use of"
12009,FOOTNOTES:,scenery in Shakespearean performances as most of our actor-managers
12010,FOOTNOTES:,(_e.g._ Mr. Benson) now adopt. I regret it in so far as it involves a
12011,FOOTNOTES:,curtailing of the play; but I do not think it withdraws from the play
12012,FOOTNOTES:,"any attention that is of value, and for some of the audience it"
12013,FOOTNOTES:,"probably heightens the dramatic effect. Still, in my belief, it would"
12014,FOOTNOTES:,"be desirable to decrease it, because the less there is of it, the"
12015,FOOTNOTES:,"more is good acting necessary, and the more of the play itself can be"
12016,FOOTNOTES:,"acted. Some use of scenery, with its consequences to the play, must"
12017,FOOTNOTES:,"unquestionably be accepted as the rule, but I would add that it ought"
12018,FOOTNOTES:,"always to be possible for us to see performances, such as we owed to"
12019,FOOTNOTES:,"Mr. Poel, nearer to those of Shakespeare's time."

12021,FOOTNOTES:,"[24] When, in the time of Malone and Steevens, the question was"
12022,FOOTNOTES:,"debated whether Shakespeare's stage had scenery, it was argued that"
12023,FOOTNOTES:,"it must have had it, because otherwise the contrast between the words"
12024,FOOTNOTES:,and the visible stage in the passage referred to would have been
12025,FOOTNOTES:,hopelessly ludicrous.

12036,FOOTNOTES:,omission of 'How all occasions' from the Folio doubtless means that
12037,FOOTNOTES:,the company cut this soliloquy (whether they did so in the author's
12038,FOOTNOTES:,"life-time we cannot tell). It may be noticed that, where a play shows"
12039,FOOTNOTES:,"clear signs of revision by Shakespeare himself, we rarely find a"
12040,FOOTNOTES:,disposition to shorten long poetical speeches.

12045,FOOTNOTES:,In some of these lectures[1]--for the duties and pleasures that have
12046,FOOTNOTES:,fallen to me as Professor of Poetry are now to end--I may have betrayed
12047,FOOTNOTES:,a certain propensity to philosophise. But I should ask pardon for this
12048,FOOTNOTES:,"only if I believed it to intrude where it has no place, in the"
12049,FOOTNOTES:,imaginative perception of poetry. Philosophy has long been at home in
12050,FOOTNOTES:,this University; in the remarkable development of English philosophical
12051,FOOTNOTES:,thought during the last five-and-thirty years Oxford has played a
12052,FOOTNOTES:,leading part; and I hope the time will never come when a son of hers
12053,FOOTNOTES:,"will need to apologise to his brethren for talking philosophy. Besides,"
12054,FOOTNOTES:,"though I owe her gratitude for many gifts, and most for the friendships"
12055,FOOTNOTES:,"she gave me, her best intellectual gift was the conviction that what"
12056,FOOTNOTES:,"imagination loved as poetry reason might love as philosophy, and that in"
12057,FOOTNOTES:,"the end these are two ways of saying the same thing. And, finally, I"
12058,FOOTNOTES:,"hoped, by dwelling in these lectures (for instance, with reference to"
12059,FOOTNOTES:,the poets of Wordsworth's time) on the connection of poetry with the
12060,FOOTNOTES:,"wider life around it, to correct an impression which my opening lecture"
12061,FOOTNOTES:,seems here and there to have left. Not that I can withdraw or even
12062,FOOTNOTES:,modify the view put forward then. So far as any single function of
12063,FOOTNOTES:,"spiritual life can be said to have an intrinsic value, poetry, it seems"
12064,FOOTNOTES:,"to me, possesses it just as other functions do, and it is in each case"
12065,FOOTNOTES:,"irreplaceable. And further, it seems to me, poetry attains its own aim,"
12066,FOOTNOTES:,"and in doing so makes its contribution to the whole, most surely and"
12067,FOOTNOTES:,fully when it seeks its own end without attempting to reach those of
12068,FOOTNOTES:,"co-ordinate functions, such as the attainment of philosophic truth or"
12069,FOOTNOTES:,the furtherance of moral progress. But then I believe this because I
12070,FOOTNOTES:,also believe that the unity of human nature in its diverse activities is
12071,FOOTNOTES:,so intimate and pervasive that no influence can affect any one of them
12072,FOOTNOTES:,"alone, and that no one of them can operate or change without"
12073,FOOTNOTES:,transmitting its influence to the rest. If I may use the language of
12074,FOOTNOTES:,paradox I would say that the pursuit of poetry for its own sake is the
12075,FOOTNOTES:,pursuit both of truth and of goodness. Devotion to it is devotion to
12076,FOOTNOTES:,'the good cause of the world'; and wherever the imagination is
12077,FOOTNOTES:,"satisfied, there, if we had a knowledge we have not, we should discover"
12078,FOOTNOTES:,no idle fancy but the image of a truth.
