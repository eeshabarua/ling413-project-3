989,SIX SONGS OF GIRLHOOD,That none could understand.
990,SIX SONGS OF GIRLHOOD,
991,SIX SONGS OF GIRLHOOD,"Said they: Where, sister, hast thou been?"
992,SIX SONGS OF GIRLHOOD,What hidden glory hast thou seen?
993,SIX SONGS OF GIRLHOOD,What magic sod
994,SIX SONGS OF GIRLHOOD,Has thy white foot trod;
995,SIX SONGS OF GIRLHOOD,What song-filled groves of green?
996,SIX SONGS OF GIRLHOOD,
997,SIX SONGS OF GIRLHOOD,Said she: I followed across the plain
998,SIX SONGS OF GIRLHOOD,"To the gates of Love, to the gates of Pain:"
999,SIX SONGS OF GIRLHOOD,"By one, by two,"
1000,SIX SONGS OF GIRLHOOD,All the rest went through:
1001,SIX SONGS OF GIRLHOOD,But I came back again....

1011,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,The Faithful Wife
1012,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1013,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1014,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,It was a banished chieftain
1015,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"Returned from oversea,"
1016,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,And he saw his wife and children
1017,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Come smiling o'er the lea.
1018,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1019,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"The moon had wrapped them in her beams,"
1020,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"The wind was in their hair,"
1021,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Their feet that trod the wild bluebell
1022,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Were light as wings on air.
1023,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1024,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"'O have you come to meet me, wife,"
1025,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,As you once did swear to do?
1026,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"Full seven years have I been gone,"
1027,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,And was your word so true?'
1028,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1029,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,He took her by the white cool hand
1030,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Where the golden rings shone gay;
1031,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,He took her youngest on his arm
1032,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,And joyful led the way.
1033,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1034,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"'O fair are ye, my father's towers,"
1035,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,And sweet my garden dear:
1036,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,God grant I never leave you more
1037,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Till Death o'ertake me here!'
1038,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1039,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"The lights were burning in the hall,"
1040,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,As they sat them down to meat;
1041,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,The pipers piped a merry tune
1042,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,The while their lord did eat.
1043,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1044,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"He looked to right, he looked to left,"
1045,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"And a happy man was he,"
1046,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,As he stroked the head of the good gre-hound
1047,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,That stood beside his knee.
1048,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1049,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"'O, I am weary, wife, my wife,"
1050,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,And the flames begin to pale;
1051,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"Lead on, for I would sleep awhile"
1052,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Before I tell my tale.'
1053,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1054,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,She lifted the bright curtain
1055,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,That led into her bower;
1056,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,There came the tramp of parting feet
1057,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,And silence held the tower.
1058,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1059,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"'O wife, how long have I been gone?"
1060,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,The room smells of roses still--
1061,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"O wife, our babes are very young,"
1062,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Their limbs are cold and chill....'
1063,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1064,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"She folded up their raiment small,"
1065,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,She smiled but said no word:
1066,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"She laid her children in one bed,"
1067,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Then came beside her lord.
1068,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1069,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"He could not sleep, he could not wake,"
1070,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,But lay in silence there;
1071,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"His dear wife held him by the hand,"
1072,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,He felt her wind-blown hair--
1073,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1074,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"'O Mother! Mother!' whispered one,"
1075,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,'Why must we sleep so soon?
1076,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"The sun is hidden down below,"
1077,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,I still can see the moon.'
1078,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1079,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"'Be quiet, be quiet, my little child,"
1080,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,And watch the moonbeams creep;
1081,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"To-night you may not play about,"
1082,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,For your father lies asleep.'
1083,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1084,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"'O Mother! Mother!' whispered one,"
1085,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,'It is not time for bed!
1086,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Where have you put my little lid?
1087,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,I cannot hide my head.'
1088,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1089,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"'Lie still, lie still, my tiny child,"
1090,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Your father dear is found:
1091,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,We four shall never sleep again
1092,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,In the dark and heavy mound.'
1093,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1094,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"'O Mother! Mother!' whispered one,"
1095,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,'How shall that ever be?
1096,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,We may not bide in the light of day
1097,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,To watch upon the lea.'
1098,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1099,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"'No need, no need, my pretty child,"
1100,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,For your father dear has come;
1101,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"We'll kiss him once, we'll kiss him twice,"
1102,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Then seek our own far home.'
1103,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1104,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"He heard them laugh with baby joy,"
1105,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"He felt their kisses sweet,"
1106,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,He heard the patter to the door
1107,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Of their unearthly feet....
1108,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1109,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,He could not stir when she bent low
1110,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,To kiss him on the lips--
1111,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"He could not raise, to hold her fast,"
1112,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,His anguished finger-tips;
1113,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1114,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,But his heart against her silent breast
1115,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Beat loud in wild despair--
1116,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"He heard the swaying of her skirt,"
1117,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,And his soul leapt forth in prayer.
1118,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1119,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,.     .     .     .     .
1120,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1121,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,A shepherd rose to call his sheep
1122,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,When the morning sky was gray;
1123,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,The owl flew back to the ruined tower--
1124,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,He led his flock that way.
1125,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1126,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,And lo! amid the scattered stones
1127,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"That the foe had strewn around,"
1128,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,He saw his long-lost chieftain lie
1129,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,A corpse upon the ground.
1130,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,
1131,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"A smile was on his breathless lips,"
1132,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,"And he lay on the flowered sward,"
1133,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Where his wife and babes had bled to death
1134,THE FAITHFUL WIFE,Beneath a traitor's sword.

1150,WOMANHOOD,"Of the speechless soul, in silence triple-crowned!"
1151,WOMANHOOD,My love's proud empire smiles to know thee King;
1152,WOMANHOOD,And in the realms of Womanhood I wind
1153,WOMANHOOD,"A coronet of Faith, a blood-rose ring"
1154,WOMANHOOD,With azure chain of sapphire intertwined;
1155,WOMANHOOD,"And where the mind's pure kingdom is, I seek"
1156,WOMANHOOD,"Bright crystals, pearls of Truth divine and rare"
1157,WOMANHOOD,To honour thee; but on the aërial peak
1158,WOMANHOOD,That marks the Soul's eternal region--there

1170,WOMANHOOD,And cries: My sacred mount's a thing as low
1171,WOMANHOOD,As any hillock; shallow rolls the sea
1172,WOMANHOOD,That should have quenched my deep unbounded thirst;
1173,WOMANHOOD,My star's a lamp that flickers earthly light;

1193,WOMANHOOD,More fleeting than the beauty of a flame:
1194,WOMANHOOD,Now each within the other's hungering eye
1195,WOMANHOOD,"Beholds the corse of Joy embalmèd lie,"
1196,WOMANHOOD,And smiles to know his penury the same.

1198,WOMANHOOD,"New-sprung from ruin, tho' our lips be sealed"
1199,WOMANHOOD,By silence and the world's hard fetter. Dear

1212,WOMANHOOD,"Your vision, else there never would have been"
1213,WOMANHOOD,"A cause for parting. Love-enwrapped, your eyes"
1214,WOMANHOOD,Failed in my love Love's self to recognise:
1215,WOMANHOOD,"You saw its outer garment, where the green"
1216,WOMANHOOD,"Of perfect faith was marred by passion's sheen,"
1217,WOMANHOOD,By outworn patience and desire's disguise.
1218,WOMANHOOD,"Had you but read me to the inner soul,"
1219,WOMANHOOD,You would have held me fast. I can forego
1220,WOMANHOOD,"All that is sought of hand and lip, the whole"

1255,WOMANHOOD,My heart is weary and would forget.
1256,WOMANHOOD,
1257,WOMANHOOD,O give me nothing! 'Tis far too late:
1258,WOMANHOOD,"Your much were little my thirst to fill,"

1272,WOMANHOOD,
1273,WOMANHOOD,"The butterflies have long since gone,"
1274,WOMANHOOD,Gone to the bough where the gay blossoms are;

1276,WOMANHOOD,To other lands afar.
1277,WOMANHOOD,
1278,WOMANHOOD,"I want to break my heart away,"

1293,WOMANHOOD,
1294,WOMANHOOD,"One rose on my bower, one rose"
1295,WOMANHOOD,For a day to scatter on the grass:
1296,WOMANHOOD,"One shifting star agleam where the wind blows,"
1297,WOMANHOOD,"One gem upheld, that all may share who pass:"
1298,WOMANHOOD,
1299,WOMANHOOD,"One heart to be ached for, one heart"
1300,WOMANHOOD,Out of all the bosoms that are here:
1301,WOMANHOOD,"One fragile hope alive, the starver's part,"
1302,WOMANHOOD,One joy already faint and pale with fear:
1303,WOMANHOOD,
1304,WOMANHOOD,"One flame in the darkness, one flame"
1305,WOMANHOOD,For the night to sever with a breath:

1315,WOMANHOOD,I sometimes watch the lips of other women
1316,WOMANHOOD,And think of all the kisses they have known;
1317,WOMANHOOD,I sometimes touch the hands of other women
1318,WOMANHOOD,In wonder at the memoried palms they own....
1319,WOMANHOOD,
1320,WOMANHOOD,"The kiss upon my brow was sadly given,"
1321,WOMANHOOD,The hands I held but once were not my own;
1322,WOMANHOOD,And yet I would not change what I was given
1323,WOMANHOOD,For all the kisses I have never known....
1324,WOMANHOOD,
1325,WOMANHOOD,Nor would I change again my heart's white desert;
1326,WOMANHOOD,"O wondrous are the meetings I have known,"
1327,WOMANHOOD,"And strange the eyes that seek me in the desert,"
1328,WOMANHOOD,Then smiling vanish to rejoin their own....

1337,WOMANHOOD,Unstirred by voices creeps from room to room;
1338,WOMANHOOD,"No footstep falls upon the silent stair,"
1339,WOMANHOOD,All's still and dark. In every nook the tomb
1340,WOMANHOOD,Of some thought lies; remembrance everywhere
1341,WOMANHOOD,Lingers to seek a joy no longer there;
1342,WOMANHOOD,"And, as I sit here lonely in the gloom,"
1343,WOMANHOOD,I ask myself which evil I would choose:

1355,WOMANHOOD,"Within me. Now my heart's asleep,"
1356,WOMANHOOD,It dreams of joys it might not keep;
1357,WOMANHOOD,And nothing looks before
1358,WOMANHOOD,Within me now. My heart's asleep

1388,WOMANHOOD,
1389,WOMANHOOD,"I dreamed that, wandering by a river's bank,"
1390,WOMANHOOD,I came across a lonely ship that sank
1391,WOMANHOOD,In lifeless waters. Day was dim;--in dreams
1392,WOMANHOOD,"We see nor sun, nor moon; unearthly gleams"
1393,WOMANHOOD,Of deadened light fall strangely from the sky.--
1394,WOMANHOOD,There were but three that struggled not to die:
1395,WOMANHOOD,"A man, a woman, and a tender child;"
1396,WOMANHOOD,He sought to save them both with effort wild
1397,WOMANHOOD,And dragged his love to the entangled shore;
1398,WOMANHOOD,But down the slimy weeds she slid once more
1399,WOMANHOOD,"Into the water, and her lover's breast"
1400,WOMANHOOD,"Received her, and together they found rest."
1401,WOMANHOOD,The child was saved; my hand towards her hand
1402,WOMANHOOD,"Outstretched, drew all her sweetness to the land,"
1403,WOMANHOOD,"Where naked, like a lily wet with rain,"
1404,WOMANHOOD,She sank and loudly wept at her life's gain.
1405,WOMANHOOD,"Quite small she was, and light; I bore her fast"
1406,WOMANHOOD,"To what seemed home, and there she smiled at last"
1407,WOMANHOOD,And sat upright within my arms; I found
1408,WOMANHOOD,"A bright-hued veil wherein to wrap her round,"
1409,WOMANHOOD,Tissues that far in morning-lands were spun
1410,WOMANHOOD,By those who love the flowers and the sun.
1411,WOMANHOOD,"I laid her softly in a silken bed,"
1412,WOMANHOOD,Strewed fragrant violets about her head
1413,WOMANHOOD,And left her.
1414,WOMANHOOD,'Twas my dream then that I slept.
1415,WOMANHOOD,"But when at dawn unto her bed I crept,"
1416,WOMANHOOD,The child was lost. Her pillow was all wet
1417,WOMANHOOD,With tears that still flowed on; and faster yet
1418,WOMANHOOD,"They flowed in quickening rills, until I thought"
1419,WOMANHOOD,I stood beside a torrent wide that sought
1420,WOMANHOOD,"An unknown sea. The day was sad, tho' young;"
1421,WOMANHOOD,Upon a misty branch some bird had sung
1422,WOMANHOOD,And left a trembling silence; all around
1423,WOMANHOOD,I saw the little daisies on the ground
1424,WOMANHOOD,"Fast closed, with folded arm-petals in vain"
1425,WOMANHOOD,Shielding their yellow hearts from the cold rain.
1426,WOMANHOOD,--A voice invisible made murmur then:
1427,WOMANHOOD,'Come here and look upon these poor drowned men!
1428,WOMANHOOD,The ship was sunk a year ago to-day....'
1429,WOMANHOOD,"But I stepped back and shuddering turned away,"
1430,WOMANHOOD,For I had never seen the face of Death.
1431,WOMANHOOD,Yet Fear itself soon drew me with quick breath
1432,WOMANHOOD,"Back to the place, even to the river's brink"
1433,WOMANHOOD,Where I had seen that lonely vessel sink.
1434,WOMANHOOD,"And there in waters deep I saw them lie,"
1435,WOMANHOOD,With hands at rest and eyes that sought the sky:
1436,WOMANHOOD,Clear eyes wide open to an unseen day.
1437,WOMANHOOD,"In wondrous silence motionless they lay,"
1438,WOMANHOOD,With white lips smiling on their spirit's bliss.
1439,WOMANHOOD,"'Is Death but this?' I cried, 'no more but this?'"
1440,WOMANHOOD,And answer came: 'Among those faces there
1441,WOMANHOOD,Are all unknown?'

1443,WOMANHOOD,"With perfect peace, my enemy, even he"
1444,WOMANHOOD,Of all the world who most had tortured me.
1445,WOMANHOOD,"He lay there, blessed among the blessed, and smiled"
1446,WOMANHOOD,With eyes more pure than any wakening child.
1447,WOMANHOOD,The little waves in passing--like the breeze
1448,WOMANHOOD,That stirs the foliage of the unmoved trees--
1449,WOMANHOOD,"Played in their hair, and fluttering grasses rose"
1450,WOMANHOOD,And fell and danced about their mute repose.
1451,WOMANHOOD,But I gazed on until I too had drunk
1452,WOMANHOOD,"Of their lips' joy, until their peace had sunk"

1464,WOMANHOOD,A child bent low to watch his eyes--
1465,WOMANHOOD,"He smiling waked, and saw the skies."
1466,WOMANHOOD,
1467,WOMANHOOD,"I know a soul now, fast asleep,"
1468,WOMANHOOD,Whose dreams are sad: I hear him weep;

1481,WOMANHOOD,Beneath the moonless sky--this radiant chart
1482,WOMANHOOD,Of the unfathomable Heavens where dart
1483,WOMANHOOD,Beam-trailing stars--with lamp of love alight
1484,WOMANHOOD,Unto your images; my reverent sight
1485,WOMANHOOD,"Enfolds you, and I bring you each your part"
1486,WOMANHOOD,Of piety. The Will that guides each star
1487,WOMANHOOD,"Gave jewels to my hands I might not hold,"
1488,WOMANHOOD,"Whose grace remembered fills my palm. So rest,"
1489,WOMANHOOD,"O Joy-givers! your kingdoms are afar,"

1500,WOMANHOOD,Where Life and Death hold hands in silence; here
1501,WOMANHOOD,In solemn shade where towering cypress rear
1502,WOMANHOOD,"Their green eternal, white as wind-led foam"
1503,WOMANHOOD,Lie scattered stones that shield the final home
1504,WOMANHOOD,Of exiles. Fair their bed; by violets dear
1505,WOMANHOOD,"And swaying roses decked; above them, clear"
1506,WOMANHOOD,In bluest glory arches Heaven's dome.
1507,WOMANHOOD,'Twas here my heart encountered peace one day
1508,WOMANHOOD,Beside an old man's grave that said: If God
1509,WOMANHOOD,"Condemn you live beyond your friend, this way"
1510,WOMANHOOD,You too may rest.--The heart is childish; dread
1511,WOMANHOOD,Of earth-loss fades before Trelawny dead
1512,WOMANHOOD,Close-gathered to his Shelley in the sod.

1586,I,The slave of dreams; but now that I behold

1588,I,"I will take refuge, simply, on thy breast."
1589,I,"No miracle I seek, no rapturous dawn"
1590,I,Of an unearthly day; I will but rest
1591,I,"My weary eyes, and lay between thy hands"
1592,I,These empty fingers that have ceased to clutch
1593,I,At stars. Because my spirit understands
1594,I,"Renouncement, thou wilt give, maybe. Not much"

1609,II,"So wandered I, so left each land behind,"
1610,II,"Bearing my soul as helmsman, sage but blind;"

1716,VII,"When climbing noons began to softly burn,"
1717,VII,There seemed a tender joy in every bud

1735,VIII,"Of care and you my anguish, something locks"

1737,VIII,"Man's thinkings, and here finds a new strange mode"
1738,VIII,"Of welding chance-divided loves, a link"
1739,VIII,"That's more than human, that is half divine,"
1740,VIII,"Since, beggared of you, still I hold you mine"

1756,IX,"Of this dark forest. If you now alight,"
1757,IX,Give water to my lips and through the night
1758,IX,"Keep peril from me, with the morning's clear"
1759,IX,"New dawn I'll rise again, and both will reap"

1892,THE OPEN AIR,Spring's for every breast that wills;
1893,THE OPEN AIR,"And thy note, O Cuckoo, stills"
1894,THE OPEN AIR,All the ache of winter here.
1895,THE OPEN AIR,Lo! the scattered leaves are sere
1896,THE OPEN AIR,Of my sorrow; and I tread them
1897,THE OPEN AIR,"Into earth. The bough that shed them,"
1898,THE OPEN AIR,Soon in budded joy shall be
1899,THE OPEN AIR,Harmonious with the day's felicity.

1912,THE OPEN AIR,"'Tis sin to be pining,"
1913,THE OPEN AIR,"The hedge-drops are shining,"
1914,THE OPEN AIR,And the wild winds have fled to the snow-lands far.
1915,THE OPEN AIR,
1916,THE OPEN AIR,"O come! and be merry,"
1917,THE OPEN AIR,"For white blows the cherry,"
1918,THE OPEN AIR,The bluebells ring out on their stem so tall:
1919,THE OPEN AIR,Each cowslip's dear yellow
1920,THE OPEN AIR,"Cries joy to its fellow,"
1921,THE OPEN AIR,And the wind-flowers dance to the cuckoo's call.
1922,THE OPEN AIR,
1923,THE OPEN AIR,O what is the sun for?
1924,THE OPEN AIR,"Come, grief is all done for,"

1942,THE OPEN AIR,"From ancient boughs, serenely tall,"
1943,THE OPEN AIR,"The chequered shadows length'ning fall,"
1944,THE OPEN AIR,And town seems far away.
1945,THE OPEN AIR,Such rest is here as woodland yields:
1946,THE OPEN AIR,Here too are lambs in flowered fields--
1947,THE OPEN AIR,Why heed the wheels that pass?
1948,THE OPEN AIR,
1949,THE OPEN AIR,Thought sinks beneath our fitful speech
1950,THE OPEN AIR,"Into the tremor of our peace,"

1954,THE OPEN AIR,"A respite to the world's unrest,"

1969,THE OPEN AIR,Where brooks are never seen?
1970,THE OPEN AIR,Come! roses blow: sweet flower
1971,THE OPEN AIR,Will snow the virgin's-bower:
1972,THE OPEN AIR,"The shaded lane, the woodland wild,"
1973,THE OPEN AIR,Are better both for man and child.
1974,THE OPEN AIR,
1975,THE OPEN AIR,O who would live in the narrow street
1976,THE OPEN AIR,When skies are broad and free?
1977,THE OPEN AIR,O who would bide in the stony street
1978,THE OPEN AIR,When the sun is on the sea?

1994,THE OPEN AIR,"Hangs tremulous, a shield through which the sun"
1995,THE OPEN AIR,Shines as the heart smiles in a mist of tears.
1996,THE OPEN AIR,"The trees are green still, but their branches bear"
1997,THE OPEN AIR,The blossoms of the fall; each quivering birch
1998,THE OPEN AIR,Shakes golden coins upon her silver stem;
1999,THE OPEN AIR,"The little rowan rears his corals gay,"
2000,THE OPEN AIR,"The purple sloes are thick upon the thorn,"
2001,THE OPEN AIR,And every breeze new-scatters to the ground
2002,THE OPEN AIR,Spoils red and yellow. Here upon the hill
2003,THE OPEN AIR,Where at our feet bee-haunted heather glows
2004,THE OPEN AIR,"Among the rocks, sweet peace enfolds us; see,"
2005,THE OPEN AIR,On velvet slopes afar the patient kine
2006,THE OPEN AIR,In silence browse; the plough in furrows wide
2007,THE OPEN AIR,Has turned the weary earth to rest; the sun
2008,THE OPEN AIR,"Sinks and, across the valley, mountains fade"

2010,THE OPEN AIR,"The hour of silver comes now, for the moon"

2015,THE OPEN AIR,O Heart
2016,THE OPEN AIR,Of man!--why must you throb apart and know
2017,THE OPEN AIR,A tempered Peace where Nature's Peace is pure?
2018,THE OPEN AIR,Already winter's snows upon the hills
2019,THE OPEN AIR,Like phantoms to our vision rise; the trees
2020,THE OPEN AIR,"Groan leafless in the wind, and ghosts of pain"
2021,THE OPEN AIR,Flit dark between the present and our eyes.
2022,THE OPEN AIR,"'Tis thus we murder Joy, and let To-morrow,"
2023,THE OPEN AIR,"A still-born Terror, anguish dear To-day:"
2024,THE OPEN AIR,"'Tis thus, possessing Wealth, we shiver poor"
2025,THE OPEN AIR,Ere we are stricken: thus our claspèd hands
2026,THE OPEN AIR,Grow cold and ache with Solitude to be....
