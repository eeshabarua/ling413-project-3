113,THE THANKLESS MUSE,
114,THE THANKLESS MUSE,The muses ring my bell and run away.
115,THE THANKLESS MUSE,"I spy you, rogues, behind the evergreen:"
116,THE THANKLESS MUSE,"You, wild Thalia, romper in the hay;"
117,THE THANKLESS MUSE,"And you, Terpsichore, you long-legged quean."
118,THE THANKLESS MUSE,"When I was young you used to come and stay,"
119,THE THANKLESS MUSE,"But, now that I grow older, 'tis well seen"
120,THE THANKLESS MUSE,What tricks ye put upon me.  Well-a-day!
121,THE THANKLESS MUSE,How many a summer evening have ye been
122,THE THANKLESS MUSE,"Sitting about my door-step, fain to sing"
123,THE THANKLESS MUSE,"And tell old tales, while through the fragrant dark"
124,THE THANKLESS MUSE,"Burned the large planets, throbbed the brooding sound"
125,THE THANKLESS MUSE,Of crickets and the tree-toads' ceaseless ring;
126,THE THANKLESS MUSE,And in the meads the fire-fly lit her spark
127,THE THANKLESS MUSE,Where from my threshold sank the vale profound.

133,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,
134,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,So late and long the shadows lie
135,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,Under the quadrangle wall:
136,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,From such a narrow strip of sky
137,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,"So scant an hour the sunbeams fall,"
138,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,They hardly come to touch at all
139,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,"This cool, sequestered corner where,"
140,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,"Beside the chapel belfry tall,"
141,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,I cultivate my small parterre.
142,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,
143,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,"Poor, sickly blooms of Academe,"
144,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,"Recluses of the college close,"
145,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,Whose nun-like pallor would beseem
146,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,The violet better than the rose:
147,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,There's not a bud among you blows
148,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,With scent or hue to lure the bee:
149,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,Only the thorn that on you grows--
150,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,Only the thorn grows hardily.
151,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,
152,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,"Pale cloisterers, have you lost so soon"
153,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,The way to blush?  Do you forget
154,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,"How once, beneath the enamored moon,"
155,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,"You climbed against the parapet,"
156,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,To touch the breast of Juliet
157,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,"Warm with a kiss, wet with a tear,"
158,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,"In gardens of the Capulet,"
159,BLUE ROSES OF ACADEMUS,"Far south, my flowers, not here--not here?"

165,THE WINDS OF DAWN,
166,THE WINDS OF DAWN,Whither do ye blow?
167,THE WINDS OF DAWN,For now the moon is low.
168,THE WINDS OF DAWN,"Whence is it that ye come,"
169,THE WINDS OF DAWN,And where is it ye go?
170,THE WINDS OF DAWN,"All night the air was still,"
171,THE WINDS OF DAWN,The crickets' song was shrill;
172,THE WINDS OF DAWN,But now there runs a hum
173,THE WINDS OF DAWN,And rustling through the trees.
174,THE WINDS OF DAWN,"A breath of coolness wakes,"
175,THE WINDS OF DAWN,"As on Canadian lakes,"
176,THE WINDS OF DAWN,"And on Atlantic seas,"
177,THE WINDS OF DAWN,And each high Alpine lawn
178,THE WINDS OF DAWN,Begin the winds of dawn.

184,ANACREONTIC,
185,ANACREONTIC,I would not be
186,ANACREONTIC,A voyager on the windy seas:
187,ANACREONTIC,More sweet to me
188,ANACREONTIC,"This bank where crickets chirp, and bees"
189,ANACREONTIC,Buzz drowsy sunshine minstrelsies.
190,ANACREONTIC,
191,ANACREONTIC,I would not bide
192,ANACREONTIC,On lonely heights where shepherds dwell.
193,ANACREONTIC,At twilight tide
194,ANACREONTIC,"The sounds that from the valley swell,"
195,ANACREONTIC,"Soft breathing lute and herdsman's bell,"
196,ANACREONTIC,Are sweeter far
197,ANACREONTIC,Than music of cold mountain rills.
198,ANACREONTIC,The evening star
199,ANACREONTIC,"Wakes love and song below, but chills"
200,ANACREONTIC,With mist and breeze the gloomy hills.
201,ANACREONTIC,
202,ANACREONTIC,I would not woo
203,ANACREONTIC,"Some storm-browed Juno, queenly fair."
204,ANACREONTIC,Soft eyes of blue
205,ANACREONTIC,And sudden blushes unaware
206,ANACREONTIC,Do net my heart in silken snare.
207,ANACREONTIC,
208,ANACREONTIC,I do not love
209,ANACREONTIC,"The eyrie, but low woodland nest"
210,ANACREONTIC,Of cushat dove:
211,ANACREONTIC,"Not wind, but calm; not toil, but rest"
212,ANACREONTIC,And sleep in grassy meadow's breast.

218,BUMBLE BEE,
219,BUMBLE BEE,As I lay yonder in tall grass
220,BUMBLE BEE,A drunken bumble-bee went past
221,BUMBLE BEE,Delirious with honey toddy.
222,BUMBLE BEE,The golden sash about his body
223,BUMBLE BEE,Could scarce keep in his swollen belly
224,BUMBLE BEE,Distent with honey-suckle jelly.
225,BUMBLE BEE,Rose liquor and the sweet pea wine
226,BUMBLE BEE,Had filled his soul with song divine;
227,BUMBLE BEE,Deep had he drunk the warm night through:
228,BUMBLE BEE,His hairy thighs were wet with dew.
229,BUMBLE BEE,Full many an antic he had played
230,BUMBLE BEE,While the world went round through sleep and shade.
231,BUMBLE BEE,Oft had he lit with thirsty lip
232,BUMBLE BEE,"Some flower-cup's nectared sweets to sip,"
233,BUMBLE BEE,When on smooth petals he would slip
234,BUMBLE BEE,"Or over tangled stamens trip,"
235,BUMBLE BEE,"And headlong in the pollen rolled,"
236,BUMBLE BEE,Crawl out quite dusted o'er with gold.
237,BUMBLE BEE,Or else his heavy feet would stumble
238,BUMBLE BEE,Against some bud and down he'd tumble
239,BUMBLE BEE,Amongst the grass; there lie and grumble
240,BUMBLE BEE,"In low, soft bass--poor maudlin bumble!"
241,BUMBLE BEE,With tipsy hum on sleepy wing
242,BUMBLE BEE,He buzzed a glee--a bacchic thing
243,BUMBLE BEE,"Which, wandering strangely in the moon,"
244,BUMBLE BEE,"He learned from grigs that sing in June,"
245,BUMBLE BEE,Unknown to sober bees who dwell
246,BUMBLE BEE,Through the dark hours in waxen cell.
247,BUMBLE BEE,When south wind floated him away
248,BUMBLE BEE,The music of the summer day
249,BUMBLE BEE,Lost something: sure it was a pain
250,BUMBLE BEE,To miss that dainty star-light strain.
251,BUMBLE BEE,

255,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET
256,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,
257,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,Mine eyes have seen when once at sunset hour
258,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,White lily flocks that edged a lonely lake
259,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,All rose and sank upon the lifting swell
260,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"That swayed their long stems lazily, and lapped"
261,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,Their floating pads and stirred among the leaves.
262,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,And when the sun from western gates of day
263,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"Poured colored flames, they, kissed to ruddy shame,"
264,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"So blushed through snowy petals, that they glowed"
265,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"Like roses morning-blown in dewy bowers,"
266,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,When garden-walks lie dark with early shade.
267,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,That so their perfumed chalices were brimmed
268,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,With liquid glory till they overflowed
269,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"And spilled rich lights and purple shadows out,"
270,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"That splashed the pool with gold, and stained its waves"
271,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,In tints of violet and ruby blooms.
272,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,But when the flashing gem that lit the day
273,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"Dropped in its far blue casket of the hills,"
274,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"The rainbow paintings faded from the mere,"
275,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"The wine-dark shades grew black, the gilding dimmed,"
276,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"While, paling slow through tender amber hues,"
277,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"The crimsoned lilies blanched to coldest white,"
278,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,And wanly shivered in the evening breeze.
279,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,When twilight closed--when earliest dew-drops fell
280,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"All frosty-chill deep down their golden hearts,"
281,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"They shrank at that still touch, as maidens shrink,"
282,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,When love's first footstep frights with sweet alarms
283,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,The untrod wildness of their virgin breasts;
284,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"Then shut their ivory cups, and dipping low"
285,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"Their folded beauties in the gloomy wave,"
286,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,They nodded drowsily and heaved in sleep.
287,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"But sweeter far than summer dreams at dawn,"
288,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"Their mingled breaths from out the darkness stole,"
289,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"Across the silent lake, the winding shores,"
290,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"The shadowy hills that rose in lawny slopes,"
291,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,"The marsh among whose reeds the wild fowl screamed,"
292,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,And dusky woodlands where the night came down.
293,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,
294,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,
295,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,
296,WATER LILIES AT SUNSET,
297,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS
298,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,
299,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"An open door and door-steps wide,"
300,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"With pillared vines on either side,"
301,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"And terraced flowers, stair over stair,"
302,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Standing in pots of earthenware
303,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Where stiff processions filed around--
304,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Black on the smooth, sienna ground."
305,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Tubers and bulbs now blossomed there
306,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Which, in the moisty hot-house air,"
307,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Lay winter long in patient rows,"
308,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Glassed snugly in from Christmas snows:
309,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Tuberoses, with white, waxy gems"
310,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,In bunches on their reed-like stems;
311,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Their fragrance forced by art too soon
312,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,To mingle with the sweets of June.
313,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"(So breathes the thin blue smoke, that steals"
314,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"From ashes of the gilt pastilles,"
315,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Burnt slowly, as the brazier swings,"
316,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,In dim saloons of eastern kings.)
317,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,I saw the calla's arching cup
318,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"With yellow spadix standing up,"
319,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Its liquid scents to stir and mix--
320,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,The goldenest of toddy-sticks;
321,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Roses and purple fuchsia drops;
322,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Camellias, which the gardener crops"
323,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,To make the sickening wreaths that lie
324,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,On coffins when our loved ones die.
325,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,These all and many more were there;
326,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Monsters and grandifloras rare,"
327,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"With tropical broad leaves, grown rank,"
328,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Drinking the waters of the tank
329,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Wherein the lotus-lilies bathe;
330,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"All curious forms of spur and spathe,"
331,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Pitcher and sac and cactus-thorn,"
332,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,There in the fresh New England morn.
333,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,But where the sun came colored through
334,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Translucent petals wet with dew,"
335,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,The interspace was carpeted
336,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"With oriel lights and nodes of red,"
337,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Orange and blue and violet,"
338,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"That wove strange figures, as they met,"
339,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Of airier tissue, brighter blooms"
340,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Than tumble from the Persian looms.
341,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"So at the pontiff's feasts, they tell,"
342,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"From the board's edge the goblet fell,"
343,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Spilled from its throat the purple tide
344,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,And stained the pavement far and wide.
345,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Such steps wise Sheba trod upon
346,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Up to the throne of Solomon;
347,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,So bright the angel-crowded steep
348,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Which Israel's vision scaled in sleep.
349,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,What one is she whose feet shall dare
350,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Tread that illuminated stair?
351,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Like Sheba, queen; like angels, fair?"
352,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Oh listen!  In the morning air
353,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,The blossoms all are hanging still--
354,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,The queen is standing on the sill.
355,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,No Sheba she; her virgin zone
356,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Proclaims her royalty alone:
357,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,(Such royalty the lions own.)
358,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Yet all too cheap the patterned stone
359,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"That paves kings' palaces, to feel"
360,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,The pressure of her gaiter's heel.
361,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,The girlish grace that lit her face
362,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Made sunshine in a dusky place--
363,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"The old silk hood, demure and quaint,"
364,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Wherein she seemed an altar-saint
365,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Fresh-tinted, though in setting old"
366,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Of dingy carving and tarnished gold;
367,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Her eyes, the candles in that shrine,"
368,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,Making Madonna's face to shine.
369,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Lingering I passed, but evermore"
370,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Abide with me the open door,"
371,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"The doorsteps wide, the flowers that stand"
372,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"In brilliant ranks on either hand,"
373,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,The two white pillars and the vine
374,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Of bitter-sweet and lush woodbine,"
375,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,And--from my weary paths as far
376,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,As Sheba or the angels are--
377,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Between, upon the wooden sill,"
378,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,"Thou, Queen of Hearts, art standing still."
379,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,
380,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,
381,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,
382,BETWEEN THE FLOWERS,
383,AS YOU LIKE IT,AS YOU LIKE IT
384,AS YOU LIKE IT,
385,AS YOU LIKE IT,Here while I read the light forsakes the pane;
386,AS YOU LIKE IT,Metempsychosis of the twilight gray--
387,AS YOU LIKE IT,Into green aisles of Epping or Ardenne
388,AS YOU LIKE IT,The level lines of print stretch far away.
389,AS YOU LIKE IT,
390,AS YOU LIKE IT,The book-leaves whisper like the forest-leaves;
391,AS YOU LIKE IT,"A smell of ancient woods, a breeze of morn,"
392,AS YOU LIKE IT,A breath of violets from the mossy paths
393,AS YOU LIKE IT,"And hark! the voice of hounds--the royal horn,"
394,AS YOU LIKE IT,
395,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Which, muffled in the ferny coverts deep,"
396,AS YOU LIKE IT,Utters the three sweet notes that sound recall;
397,AS YOU LIKE IT,"As, riding two by two between the oaks,"
398,AS YOU LIKE IT,Come on the paladins and ladies all.
399,AS YOU LIKE IT,
400,AS YOU LIKE IT,The court will rest from chase in this smooth glade
401,AS YOU LIKE IT,"That slopes to meet yon little rushy stream,"
402,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Where in the shallows nod the arrow-heads,"
403,AS YOU LIKE IT,And the blue flower-de-luce's banners gleam.
404,AS YOU LIKE IT,
405,AS YOU LIKE IT,The gamekeepers are coupling of the hounds;
406,AS YOU LIKE IT,The pages hang bright scarfs upon the boughs;
407,AS YOU LIKE IT,The new-slain quarry lies upon the turf
408,AS YOU LIKE IT,Whereon but now he with the herd did browse.
409,AS YOU LIKE IT,
410,AS YOU LIKE IT,The silk pavilion shines among the trees;
411,AS YOU LIKE IT,The mighty pasties and the flagons strong
412,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Give cheer to the dear heart of many a knight,"
413,AS YOU LIKE IT,And many a dame whose beauty lives in song.
414,AS YOU LIKE IT,
415,AS YOU LIKE IT,Meanwhile a staging improvised and rude
416,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Rises, whereon the masquers and the mimes"
417,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Play for their sport a pleasant interlude,"
418,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Fantastic, gallant, pointing at the times."
419,AS YOU LIKE IT,
420,AS YOU LIKE IT,Their green-room is the wide midsummer wood;
421,AS YOU LIKE IT,Down some far-winding gallery the deer--
422,AS YOU LIKE IT,The dappled dead-head of that sylvan show--
423,AS YOU LIKE IT,Starts as the distant ranting strikes his ear.
424,AS YOU LIKE IT,
425,AS YOU LIKE IT,They use no traverses nor painted screen
426,AS YOU LIKE IT,"To help along their naked, out-door wit:"
427,AS YOU LIKE IT,(Only the forest lends its leafy scene)
428,AS YOU LIKE IT,Yet wonderfully well they please the pit.
429,AS YOU LIKE IT,
430,AS YOU LIKE IT,The plaudits echo through the wide parquet
431,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Where the fair audience upon the grass,"
432,AS YOU LIKE IT,"Each knight beside his lady-love, is set,"
433,AS YOU LIKE IT,While overhead the merry winds do pass.
434,AS YOU LIKE IT,
435,AS YOU LIKE IT,"The little river murmurs in its reeds,"
436,AS YOU LIKE IT,And somewhere in the verdurous solitude
437,AS YOU LIKE IT,"The wood-thrush drops a cool contralto note,"
438,AS YOU LIKE IT,An orchestra well-tuned unto their mood.
439,AS YOU LIKE IT,
440,AS YOU LIKE IT,As runs the play so runs the afternoon;
441,AS YOU LIKE IT,The curtain and the sun fall side by side;
442,AS YOU LIKE IT,"The epilogue is spoke, the twilight come;"
443,AS YOU LIKE IT,Then homeward through the darkening glades they ride.
444,AS YOU LIKE IT,
445,AS YOU LIKE IT,
446,AS YOU LIKE IT,
447,AS YOU LIKE IT,
448,THE OLD CITY,THE OLD CITY
449,THE OLD CITY,
450,THE OLD CITY,"Ancient city, down thy street"
451,THE OLD CITY,Minstrels make their music sweet;
452,THE OLD CITY,"Sound of bells is on the air,"
453,THE OLD CITY,"Fountains sing in every square,"
454,THE OLD CITY,"Where, from dawn to shut of day,"
455,THE OLD CITY,Maidens walk and children play;
456,THE OLD CITY,"And at night, when all are gone,"
457,THE OLD CITY,"The waters in the dark sing on,"
458,THE OLD CITY,Till the moonrise and the breeze
459,THE OLD CITY,Whiten the horse-chestnut trees.

553,NARCISSUS,
554,NARCISSUS,Where the black hemlock slants athwart the stream
555,NARCISSUS,He came to bathe; the sun's pursuing beam
556,NARCISSUS,"Laid a warm hand upon him, as he stood"
557,NARCISSUS,"Naked, while noonday silence filled the wood."
558,NARCISSUS,"Holding the boughs o'erhead, with cautious foot"
559,NARCISSUS,He felt his way along the mossy root
560,NARCISSUS,That edged the brimming pool; then paused and dreamed.
561,NARCISSUS,"Half like a dryad of the tree he seemed,"
562,NARCISSUS,"Half like the naiad of the stream below,"
563,NARCISSUS,Suspended there between the water's flow
564,NARCISSUS,And the green tree-top world; the love-sick air
565,NARCISSUS,Coaxing with softest touch his body fair
566,NARCISSUS,A little longer yet to be content
567,NARCISSUS,Outside of its own crystal element.
568,NARCISSUS,"And he, still lingering at the brink, looked down"
569,NARCISSUS,And marked the sunshine fleck with gold the brown
570,NARCISSUS,And sandy floor which paved that woodland pool.
571,NARCISSUS,"But then, within the shadows deep and cool"
572,NARCISSUS,"Which the close hemlocks on the surface made,"
573,NARCISSUS,Two eyes met his yet darker than that shade
574,NARCISSUS,"And, shining through the watery foliage dim,"
575,NARCISSUS,Two white and slender arms reached up to him.
576,NARCISSUS,"""Comest thou again, now all the woods are still,"
577,NARCISSUS,"Fair shape, nor even Echo from the hill"
578,NARCISSUS,"Calls her Narcissus?  Would her voice were thine,"
579,NARCISSUS,"Dear speechless image, and could answer mine!"
580,NARCISSUS,Her I but hear and thee I may but see;
581,NARCISSUS,"Yet, Echo, thou art happy unto me;"
582,NARCISSUS,"For though thyself art but a voice, sad maid,"
583,NARCISSUS,Thy love the substance is and my love shade.
584,NARCISSUS,Alas! for never may I kiss those dumb
585,NARCISSUS,"Sweet lips, nor ever hope to come"
586,NARCISSUS,Into that shadow-world that lies somewhere--
587,NARCISSUS,Somewhere between the water and the air.
588,NARCISSUS,Alas! for never shall I clasp that form
589,NARCISSUS,"That mocks me yonder, seeming firm and warm;"
590,NARCISSUS,"But if I leap to its embrace, the cold"
591,NARCISSUS,And yielding flood is all my arms enfold.
592,NARCISSUS,"All creatures else, save only me, can share"
593,NARCISSUS,"My beauties, be it but to stroke my hair,"
594,NARCISSUS,"Or hold my hand in theirs, or hear me speak."
595,NARCISSUS,The village wives will laugh and clap my cheek;
596,NARCISSUS,"The forest nymphs will beg me for a kiss,"
597,NARCISSUS,"To make me blush, or hide themselves by this"
598,NARCISSUS,"Clear brook to see me bathe.  But I must pine,"
599,NARCISSUS,"Loving not me but this dear ghost of mine."""
600,NARCISSUS,"Then, bending down the boughs, until they dipped"
601,NARCISSUS,"Their broad green fronds, into the wave he slipped,"
602,NARCISSUS,"And, floating breast-high, from the branches hung,"
603,NARCISSUS,His body with the current idly swung.
604,NARCISSUS,And ever and anon he caught the gleam
605,NARCISSUS,"Of a white shoulder swimming in the stream,"
606,NARCISSUS,"Pressed close to his, and two young eyes of black"
607,NARCISSUS,Under the dimpling surface answered back
608,NARCISSUS,"His own, just out of kissing distance: then"
609,NARCISSUS,The vain and passionate longing came again
610,NARCISSUS,"Still baffled, still renewed: he loosed his hold"
611,NARCISSUS,Upon the boughs and strove once more to fold
612,NARCISSUS,To his embrace that fine unbodied shape;
613,NARCISSUS,"But the quick apparition made escape,"
614,NARCISSUS,And once again his empty arms took in
615,NARCISSUS,Only the water and the shadows thin.
616,NARCISSUS,"Thus every day, when noon lay bright and hot"
617,NARCISSUS,"On all the plains, there came to this cool spot,"
618,NARCISSUS,"Under the hemlocks by the deepening brook,"
619,NARCISSUS,"Narcissus, Phoebus' darling, there to look"
620,NARCISSUS,And pore upon his picture in the flood:
621,NARCISSUS,"Till once a peeping dryad of the wood,"
622,NARCISSUS,Tracking his steps along the slender path
623,NARCISSUS,"Which he between the tree trunks trodden hath,"
624,NARCISSUS,Misses the boy on whom her amorous eyes
625,NARCISSUS,Where wont to feed; but where he stood she spies
626,NARCISSUS,"A new-made yellow flower, that still doth seem"
627,NARCISSUS,To woo his own pale reflex in the stream;
628,NARCISSUS,Whom Phoebus kisses when the woods are still
629,NARCISSUS,And only ceaseless Echo from the hill
630,NARCISSUS,Unprompted cries _Narcissus_!

872,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"So, now and then with plank afloat"
873,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,He'd struggle feebly round the boat
874,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"And o'er the side climb puffing in,"
875,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"Scraping wide areas off his skin,"
876,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Then lie and sun each hirsute limb
877,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Once more upon the gunwale's rim
878,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"And shout, with curses unavailing,"
879,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"""Come out!  There's wind: let's do some sailing."""
880,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,
881,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"A palm-leaf hat, that here and there"
882,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"Bobbed on the water, showed him where"
883,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Some venturous swimmer outward bound
884,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Escaped beyond his voice's sound.
885,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"All heedless of their skipper's call,"
886,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,One group fought for the upset yawl.
887,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,The conqueror sat astride the keel
888,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,And deftly pounded with his heel
889,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"The hands that clutched his citadel,"
890,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Which showed--at distance--like the shell
891,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"Round which, unseen, the Naiad train"
892,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Sport naked on the middle main.
893,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"Myself had drifted far away,"
894,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"Meanwhile, from where the sail-boat lay,"
895,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Till all unbroken I could hear
896,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"The wave's low whisper in my ear,"
897,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,And at the level of mine eye
898,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,The blue vibration met the sky.
899,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Sometimes upon my back I lay
900,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"And watched the clouds, while I and they"
901,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Were wafted effortless along.--
902,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Sudden I seemed to hear a song:
903,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"Yet not a song, but some weird strain"
904,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,As though the inarticulate main
905,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Had found a voice whose human tone
906,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Interpreted its own dull moan;
907,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Its foamy hiss; its surfy roar;
908,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Its gentle lapping on the shore;
909,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Its noise of subterranean waves
910,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,That grumble in the sea-cliff caves;
911,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Its whish among the drifting miles
912,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Of gulf-weed from the Indian Isles:--
913,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,All--all the harmonies were there
914,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Which ocean makes with earth or air.
915,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Turning I saw a sunken ledge
916,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"Bared by the ebb, along whose edge"
917,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"The matted sea-weed dripped: thereon,"
918,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Betwixt the dazzle of the sun
919,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"And the blue shimmer of the sea,"
920,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,I saw--or else I seemed to see
921,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"A mermaid, crooning a wild song,"
922,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Combing with arm uplifted long
923,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,The hair that shed its meshes black
924,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Down the slope whiteness of her back.
925,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"She held a mirror in her hand,"
926,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"Wherein she viewed sky, sea, and land,"
927,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Her beauty's background and its frame.
928,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"But now, as toward the rock I came,"
929,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,All suddenly across the glass
930,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Some startling image seemed to pass;
931,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"For her song rose into a scream,"
932,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Over her shoulders one swift gleam
933,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"Of eyes unearthly fell on me,"
934,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"And, 'twixt the flashing of the sea"
935,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"And the blind dazzle of the sun,"
936,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"I saw the rock, but thereupon"
937,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,She sat no longer 'gainst the blue;
938,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Only across the reef there flew
939,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,One snow-white tern and vanished too.
940,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"But, coasting that lone island round,"
941,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Among the slippery kelp I found
942,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,A little oval glass that lay
943,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Upturned and flashing in the ray
944,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Of the down-looking sun.  Thereto
945,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,With scarce believing eyes I drew
946,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,And took it captive
947,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,A while there
948,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"I rested in the mermaid's lair,"
949,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"And felt the merry breeze that blew,"
950,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"And watched the sharpies as they flew,"
951,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"And snuffed the sea's breath thick with brine,"
952,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,And basked me in the sun's warm shine;
953,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Then with my prize I made my way
954,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Once more to where the sail-boat lay.
955,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,I kept the secret--and the glass;
956,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,By day across its surface pass
957,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,The transient shapes of common things
958,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Which chance within its oval brings.
959,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,But when at night I strive to sound
960,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"The darkness of its face profound,"
961,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Again I seem to hear the breeze
962,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,That curls the waves on summer seas;
963,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,I see the isles with cedars green;
964,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,The channels winding in between;
965,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,The coves with beaches of white sand;
966,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,The reefs where warning spindles stand;
967,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"And, through the multitudinous shimmer"
968,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"Of waves and sun, again the glimmer"
969,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,"Of eyes unearthly falls on me,"
970,THE MERMAID'S GLASS,Deep with the mystery of the sea.

1506,FAUST.,And have the twilight woods confessed to thee?
1507,FAUST.,"So wild thy song, thy smile so faint, so far"
1508,FAUST.,Thine absent eyes from earthly vision are.
1509,FAUST.,Thy song is done: why art thou listening?
1510,FAUST.,Spent is the last vibration of the string
1511,FAUST.,"Along the waves of sound.  Oh, doth thine ear"
1512,FAUST.,"Pursue the ebbing chord in some fine sphere,"
1513,FAUST.,"Where wraiths of vanished echoes live and roam,"
1514,FAUST.,"And where thy thoughts, here strangered, find a home?"
1515,FAUST.,Teach me the path to that uncharted land;
1516,FAUST.,"Discovery's keel hath never notched its strand,"
1517,FAUST.,"No passport may unbar its sealed frontier,--"
1518,FAUST.,"Too far for utmost sight, for touch too near."
1519,FAUST.,"Subtler than light, yet all opaque, the screen"
1520,FAUST.,"Which shuts us from that world, outspread between"
1521,FAUST.,The shows of sense; like as an ether thin
1522,FAUST.,Fills the vast microscopic space wherein
1523,FAUST.,The molecules of matter lie enisled.
1524,FAUST.,A world whose sound our silence is; too wild
1525,FAUST.,"Its elfin music beats, too shrill, too rare,"
1526,FAUST.,To stir the slow pulse of our thicker air.
1527,FAUST.,
1528,FAUST.,A world whose light our darkness is; that lies
1529,FAUST.,"With its sharp edges turned toward mortal eyes,"
1530,FAUST.,Like figures painted on a folded fan--
1531,FAUST.,The broken colors of some hidden plan.
1532,FAUST.,The few who but an instant's look have had
1533,FAUST.,At the spread pattern broadwise have gone mad.
1534,FAUST.,As in a high-walled oriental street
1535,FAUST.,"A sudden door flies open, and a fleet"
1536,FAUST.,Departing dream the thirsty traveler sees
1537,FAUST.,"Of fountains leaping in the shade of trees,"
1538,FAUST.,So they who once have caught the glimpse divine:
1539,FAUST.,"They have but wet their lips with goblins' wine,"
1540,FAUST.,"And, plagued with thirst immortal, must endure"

1542,FAUST.,"Of springs and dewy evening meadows rave,"
1543,FAUST.,"While hotly round them shines the tropic wave,"
1544,FAUST.,"And the false islands of mirage appear,"
1545,FAUST.,Uplifted from some transcendental sphere
1546,FAUST.,Far down below the blue horizon line.
1547,FAUST.,And thirst like theirs is nursed by songs like thine.
1548,FAUST.,"For thou, in some crepscular dim hour,"
1549,FAUST.,When the weak umber moon had hardly power
1550,FAUST.,"To cast a shadow, and a wind, half-spent,"
1551,FAUST.,"Creeping among the way-side bushes went,"
1552,FAUST.,"Hast seen a cobweb spun across the moon,"
1553,FAUST.,"A faint eclipse, penumbral, gone full soon,"
1554,FAUST.,Yet marking on the planet's smoky ring
1555,FAUST.,A silhouette as of a living thing.
1556,FAUST.,"Or on the beach making thy lonely range,"
1557,FAUST.,"Close upon sunset, when the light was strange"
1558,FAUST.,"And the low wind had meanings, thou hast known"
1559,FAUST.,"A presence nigh, betrayed by shadows thrown"
1560,FAUST.,On the red sand from bodies out of sight;
1561,FAUST.,"Even as, by the shell of curving light"
1562,FAUST.,"Pared from the dark moon's edge, the eye can tell"
1563,FAUST.,Where her full circle rounds invisible.
1564,FAUST.,
1565,FAUST.,Teach me the path into that silent land.
1566,FAUST.,"Take once again the haunted wires in hand,"
1567,FAUST.,"And pour the strain which, waking, thou hast heard"
1568,FAUST.,Whistled when night was deep by some lone bird
1569,FAUST.,"Hid in the dark and dewy sycamore,--"
1570,FAUST.,When thou hast risen and unbarred the door
1571,FAUST.,"And walked the garden paths till night was flown,"
1572,FAUST.,Listening the message sent to thee alone.
1573,FAUST.,"Ah! once again thy harp, thy voice once more,"
1574,FAUST.,Fling back the refluent tide upon the shore.
1575,FAUST.,All nature grows unearthly; all things seem
1576,FAUST.,"To break and waver off in shapes of dream,"
1577,FAUST.,And through the chinks of matter steals the dawn
1578,FAUST.,Of skies beyond the solar road withdrawn.
1579,FAUST.,"Oh, flood my soul with that pure morning-red!"
1580,FAUST.,"It is the sense that's shut, the heart that's dead:"
1581,FAUST.,All open still the world of spirits lies
1582,FAUST.,Would we but bathe us in its red sunrise.

1867,THE UPLAND,"Old farms with mossed stone fences, old grassy roads that wind"
1868,THE UPLAND,"Forever on and upward to higher fields behind,"

1880,THE UPLAND,Where smolder through the cedar screen the sunset embers red.
1881,THE UPLAND,
1882,THE UPLAND,"What should we see, if once we won on that top step to stand?"
1883,THE UPLAND,A wondrous valley world beyond?  A far-stretched tableland?
1884,THE UPLAND,"Almost it seems as though there lay the threshold of the sky,"
1885,THE UPLAND,And that the foot which crossed that sill would enter Heaven thereby.
