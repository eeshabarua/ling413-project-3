18,I,I 
19,I,"Ah! red-leafed time hath driven out the rose And crimson dew is fallen on the leaf Ere ever yet the cold white wheat be sown That hideth all earth's green and sere and red; The Moon-flower's fallen and the branch is bare, Holding no honey for the starry bees; The Maiden turns to her dark lord's demesne. "
20,II,II 
21,II,"Fairer than Enna's field when Ceres sows The stars of hyacinth and puts off grief, Fairer than petals on May morning blown Through apple-orchards where the sun hath shed His brighter petals down to make them fair; Fairer than these the Poppy-crowned One flees, And Joy goes weeping in her scarlet train. "
22,III,III 
23,III,"The faint damp wind that, ere the even, blows Piling the west with many a tawny sheaf, Then when the last glad wavering hours are mown Sigheth and dies because the day is sped; This wind is like her and the listless air Wherewith she goeth by beneath the trees, The trees that mock her with their scarlet stain. "
24,IV,IV 
25,IV,"Love that is born of Time and comes and goes! Love that doth hold all noble hearts in fief! As red leaves follow where the wind hath flown, So all men follow Love when Love is dead. O Fate of Wind! O Wind that cannot spare, But drivest out the Maid, and pourest lees Of all thy crimson on the wold again, "
26,V,V 
27,V,"Korè my heart is, let it stand sans gloze! Love's pain is long, and lo, love's joy is brief! My heart erst alway sweet is bitter grown; As crimson ruleth in the good green's stead, So grief hath taken all mine old joy's share And driven forth my solace and all ease Where pleasure bows to all-usurping pain. "
28,VI,VI 
29,VI,"Crimson the hearth where one last ember glows! My heart's new winter hath no such relief, Nor thought of Spring whose blossom he hath known Hath turned him back where Spring is banished. Barren the heart and dead the fires there, Blow! O ye ashes, where the winds shall please, But cry, ""Love also is the Yearly Slain."" "
30,VII,VII 
31,VII,"Be sped, my Canzon, through the bitter air! To him who speaketh words as fair as these, Say that I also know the ""Yearly Slain."" "

33,I,I 
34,I,"'Tis the clear light of love I praise That steadfast gloweth o'er deep waters, A clarity that gleams always. Though man's soul pass through troubled waters, Strange ways to him are openèd. To shore the beaten ship is sped If only love of light give aid. "
35,II,II 
36,II,"That fair far spear of light now lays Its long gold shaft upon the waters. Ah! might I pass upon its rays To where it gleams beyond the waters, Or might my troubled heart be fed Upon the frail clear light there shed, Then were my pain at last allay'd. "
37,III,III 
38,III,"Although the clouded storm dismays Many a heart upon these waters, The thought of that far golden blaze Giveth me heart upon the waters, Thinking thereof my bark is led To port wherein no storm I dread; No tempest maketh me afraid. "
39,IV,IV 
40,IV,"Yet when within my heart I gaze Upon my fair beyond the waters, Meseems my soul within me prays To pass straightway beyond the waters. Though I be alway banished From ways and woods that she doth tread, One thing there is that doth not fade, "
41,V,V 
42,V,"Deep in my heart that spear-print stays, That wound I gat beyond the waters, Deeper with passage of the days That pass as swift and bitter waters, While a dull fire within my head Moveth itself if word be said Which hath concern with that far maid. "
43,VI,VI 
44,VI,"My love is lovelier than the sprays Of eglantine above clear waters, Or whitest lilies that upraise Their heads in midst of moated waters. No poppy in the May-glad mead Would match her quivering lips' red If 'gainst her lips it should be laid. "
45,VII,VII 
46,VII,"The light within her eyes, which slays Base thoughts and stilleth troubled waters, Is like the gold where sunlight plays Upon the still o'ershadowed waters. When anger is there mingled There comes a keener gleam instead, Like flame that burns beneath thin jade. "
47,VIII,VIII 
48,VIII,"Know by the words here mingled What love hath made my heart his stead, Glowing like flame beneath thin jade. "

51,I,I 
52,I,"Heart mine, art mine, whose embraces Clasp but wind that past thee bloweth E'en this air so subtly gloweth, Guerdoned by thy sun-gold traces, That my heart is half afraid For the fragrance on him laid; Even so love's might amazes! "
53,II,II 
54,II,"Man's love follows many faces, My love only one face knoweth; Towards thee only my love floweth, And outstrips the swift stream's paces. Were this love well here displayed, As flame flameth 'neath thin jade Love should glow through these my phrases. "
55,III,III 
56,III,"Though I've roamed through many places, None there is that my heart troweth Fair as that wherein fair groweth One whose laud here interlaces Tuneful words, that I've essayed. Let this tune be gently played Which my voice herward upraises. "
57,IV,IV 
58,IV,"If my praise her grace effaces, Then 'tis not my heart that showeth, But the skilless tongue that soweth Words unworthy of her graces. Tongue, that hath me so betrayed, Were my heart but here displayed, Then were sung her fitting praises. "
59,CANZON: OF INCENSE,CANZON: OF INCENSE 
60,I,I 
61,I,"Thy gracious ways, O Lady of my heart, have O'er all my thought their golden glamour cast; As amber torch-flames, where strange men-at-arms Tread softly 'neath the damask shield of night, Rise from the flowing steel in part reflected, So on my mailed thought that with thee goeth, Though dark the way, a golden glamour falleth. "
62,II,II 
63,II,"The censer sways And glowing coals some art have To free what frankincense before held fast Till all the summer of the eastern farms Doth dim the sense, and dream up through the light, As memory, by new-born love corrected-- With savour such as only new love knoweth-- Through swift dim ways the hidden pasts recalleth. "
64,III,III 
65,III,"On barren days, At hours when I, apart, have Bent low in thought of the great charm thou hast, Behold with music's many-stringed charms The silence groweth thou. O rare delight! The melody upon clear strings inflected Were dull when o'er taut sense thy presence floweth, With quivering notes' accord that never palleth. "
66,IV,IV 
67,IV,"The glowing rays That from the low sun dart, have Turned gold each tower and every towering mast; The saffron flame, that flaming nothing harms Hides Khadeeth's pearl and all the sapphire might Of burnished waves, before her gates collected: The cloak of graciousness, that round thee gloweth, Doth hide the thing thou art, as here befalleth. "
68,V,V 
69,V,"All things worth praise That unto Khadeeth's mart have From far been brought through perils over-passed, All santal, myrrh, and spikenard that disarms The pard's swift anger; these would weigh but light 'Gainst thy delights, my Khadeeth! Whence protected By naught save her great grace that in him showeth, My song goes forth and on her mercy calleth. "
70,VI,VI 
71,VI,"O censer of the thought that golden gloweth, Be bright before her when the evening falleth. "
72,VII,VII 
73,VII,"Fragrant be thou as a new field one moweth, O song of mine that ""Hers"" her mercy calleth. "
74,CANZONE: OF ANGELS,CANZONE: OF ANGELS 
75,I,I 
76,I,"He that is Lord of all the realms of light Hath unto me from His magnificence Granted such vision as hath wrought my joy. Moving my spirit past the last defence That shieldeth mortal things from mightier sight, Where freedom of the soul knows no alloy, I saw what forms the lordly powers employ; Three splendours, saw I, of high holiness, From clarity to clarity ascending Through all the roofless, tacit courts extending In aether which such subtle light doth bless As ne'er the candles of the stars hath wooed; Know ye herefrom of their similitude. "
77,II,II 
78,II,"Withdrawn within the cavern of his wings, Grave with the joy of thoughts beneficent, And finely wrought and durable and clear, If so his eyes showed forth the mind's content, So sate the first to whom remembrance clings, Tissued like bat's wings did his wings appear, Not of that shadowy colouring and drear, But as thin shells, pale saffron, luminous; Alone, unlonely, whose calm glances shed Friend's love to strangers though no word were said, Pensive his godly state he keepeth thus. Not with his surfaces his power endeth, But is as flame that from the gem extendeth. "
79,III,III 
80,III,"My second marvel stood not in such ease, But he, the cloudy pinioned, winged him on Then from my sight as now from memory, The courier aquiline, so swiftly gone! The third most glorious of these majesties Give aid, O sapphires of th' eternal see, And by your light illume pure verity. That azure feldspar hight the microcline, Or, on its wing, the Menelaus weareth Such subtlety of shimmering as beareth This marvel onward through the crystalline, A splendid calyx that about her gloweth, Smiting the sunlight on whose ray she goeth. "
81,IV,IV 
82,IV,"The diver at Sorrento from beneath The vitreous indigo, who swiftly riseth, By will and not by action as it seemeth, Moves not more smoothly, and no thought surmiseth How she takes motion from the lustrous sheath Which, as the trace behind the swimmer, gleameth Yet presseth back the aether where it streameth. To her whom it adorns this sheath imparteth The living motion from the light surrounding; And thus my nobler parts, to grief's confounding, Impart into my heart a peace which starteth From one round whom a graciousness is cast Which clingeth in the air where she hath past. "
83,V--TORNATA,V--TORNATA 
84,V--TORNATA,"Canzon, to her whose spirit seems in sooth Akin unto the feldspar, since it is So clear and subtle and azure, I send thee, saying: That since I looked upon such potencies And glories as are here inscribed in truth, New boldness hath o'erthrown my long delaying, And that thy words my new-born powers obeying-- Voices at last to voice my heart's long mood-- Are come to greet her in their amplitude. "

88,I,"Who are you that the whole world's song Is shaken out beneath your feet Leaving you comfortless, Who, that, as wheat Is garnered, gather in The blades of man's sin And bear that sheaf? Lady of wrong and grief, Blameless! "
89,II,II 
90,II,"All souls beneath the gloom That pass with little flames, All these till time be run Pass one by one As Christs to save, and die; What wrong one sowed, Behold, another reaps! Where lips awake our joy The sad heart sleeps Within. "
91,II,"No man doth bear his sin, But many sins Are gathered as a cloud about man's way. "

93,TO GUIDO CAVALCANTI,"Dante and I are come to learn of thee, Ser Guido of Florence, master of us all, Love, who hath set his hand upon us three, Bidding us twain upon thy glory call. Harsh light hath rent from us the golden pall Of that frail sleep, _His_ first light seigniory, And we are come through all the modes that fall Unto their lot who meet him constantly. Wherefore, by right, in this Lord's name we greet thee, Seeing we labour at his labour daily. Thou, who dost know what way swift words are crossed O thou, who hast sung till none at song defeat thee, Grant! by thy might and hers of San Michele, Thy risen voice send flames this pentecost. "

100,SONNET: CHI È QUESTA?,"Who is she coming, that the roses bend Their shameless heads to do her passing honour? Who is she coming with a light upon her Not born of suns that with the day's end end? Say is it Love who hath chosen the nobler part? Say is it Love, that was divinity, Who hath left his godhead that his home might be The shameless rose of her unclouded heart? If this be Love, where hath he won such grace? If this be Love, how is the evil wrought, That all men write against his darkened name? If this be Love, if this ... O mind give place! What holy mystery e'er was noosed in thought? Own that thou scan'st her not, nor count it shame! "

103,II,"Full well thou knowest, song, what grace I mean, E'en as thou know'st the sunlight I have lost. Thou knowest the way of it and know'st the sheen About her brows where the rays are bound and crossed, E'en as thou knowest joy and know'st joy's bitter cost. Thou know'st her grace in moving, Thou dost her skill in loving, Thou know'st what truth she proveth, Thou knowest the heart she moveth, O song where grief assoneth! "

106,I,"When first I saw thee 'neath the silver mist, Ruling thy bark of painted sandal-wood, Did any know thee? By the golden sails That clasped the ribbands of that azure sea, Did any know thee save my heart alone? O ivory woman with thy bands of gold, Answer the song my luth and I have brought thee! "
107,II,II 
108,II,"Dream over golden dream that secret cist, Thy heart, O heart of me, doth hold, and mood On mood of silver, when the day's light fails, Say who hath touched the secret heart of thee, Or who hath known what my heart hath not known O slender pilot whom the mists enfold, Answer the song my luth and I have wrought thee! "
109,III,III 
110,III,"When new love plucks the falcon from his wrist, And cuts the gyve and casts the scarlet hood, Where is the heron heart whom flight avails? O quick to prize me Love, how suddenly From out the tumult truth has ta'en his own, And in this vision is our past unrolled. Lo! With a hawk of light thy love hath caught me. "
111,IV,IV 
112,IV,"And I shall get no peace from eucharist, Nor doling out strange prayers before the rood, To match the peace that thine hands' touch entails; Nor doth God's light match light shed over me When thy caught sunlight is about me thrown, Oh, for the very ruth thine eyes have told, Answer the rune this love of thee hath taught me. "
113,V,V 
114,V,"After an age of longing had we missed Our meeting and the dream, what were the good Of weaving cloth of words? Were jewelled tales An opiate meet to quell the malady Of life unlived? In untried monotone Were not the earth as vain, and dry, and old, For thee, O Perfect Light, had I not sought thee? "
115,VI,VI 
116,VI,"Calais, in song where word and tone keep tryst Behold my heart, and hear mine hardihood! Calais, the wind is come and heaven pales And trembles for the love of day to be. Calais, the words break and the dawn is shown. Ah, but the stars set when thou wast first bold, Turn! lest they say a lesser light distraught thee. "

And deep foss way That far beneath us bore of old A swelling turbid sea Hill-born and tumultuous Unto the fields below, where Staunch villein and Burgher held the land and tilled Long labouring for gold of wheat grain And to see the beards come forth For barley's even time. "
169,LI BEL CHASTEUS,"But archèd high above the curl of life We dwelt amid the ancient boulders, Gods had hewn and druids turned Unto that birth most wondrous, that had grown A mighty fortress while the world had slept, And we awaited in the shadows there When mighty hands had laboured sightlessly And shaped this wonder 'bove the ways of men. Me seems we could not see the great green waves Nor rocky shore by Tintagoel From this our hold, But came faint murmuring as undersong, E'en as the burghers' hum arose And died as faint wind melody Beneath our gates.

199,FROM THE ITALIAN OF PICO DELLA MIRANDOLA,"When, then, I see a lady like the sun, One fashioned by th' high hand of utmost Jove, So fair beneath the myrtles on gay grass Who holdeth Love and Truth, one by each hand, It seems, if I look straight, two bands of gold Do make more fair her delicate fair face.

201,FROM THE ITALIAN OF PICO DELLA MIRANDOLA,"Alas, that there was hidden in the grass A cruel shaft, the which, to wound my face, My Lady took in her own proper hand. If I could not defend me 'gainst that sun I take no shame, for even utmost Jove Is in high heaven pierced with darts of gold. "

419,PORTRAIT D'UNE FEMME,"Your mind and you are our Sargasso Sea, London has swept about you this score years And bright ships left you this or that in fee: Ideas, old gossip, oddments of all things, Strange spars of knowledge and dimmed wares of price. Great minds have sought you--lacking someone else. You have been second always. Tragical? No. You preferred it to the usual thing: One dull man, dulling and uxorious, One average mind--with one thought less, each year. Oh, you are patient, I have seen you sit Hours, where something might have floated up. And now you pay one. Yes, you richly pay. You are a person of some interest, one comes to you And takes strange gain away: Trophies fished up; some curious suggestion; Fact that leads nowhere; and a tale for two, Pregnant with mandrakes, or with something else That might prove useful and yet never proves, That never fits a corner or shows use, Or finds its hour upon the loom of days: The tarnished, gaudy, wonderful old work; Idols and ambergris and rare inlays, These are your riches, your great store; and yet For all this sea-hoard of deciduous things, Strange woods half sodden, and new brighter stuff: In the slow float of differing light and deep, No! there is nothing! In the whole and all, Nothing that's quite your own. Yet this is you. "

434,THE SEAFARER,THE SEAFARER 
435,THE SEAFARER,(_From the early Anglo-Saxon text_) 
436,THE SEAFARER,"May I for my own self song's truth reckon, Journey's jargon, how I in harsh days Hardship endured oft. Bitter breast-cares have I abided, Known on my keel many a care's hold, And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted, My feet were by frost benumbed. Chill its chains are; chafing sighs Hew my heart round and hunger begot Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not That he on dry land loveliest liveth, List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea, Weathered the winter, wretched outcast Deprived of my kinsmen; Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew, There I heard naught save the harsh sea And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries, Did for my games the gannet's clamour, Sea-fowls' loudness was for me laughter, The mews' singing all my mead-drink. Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed With spray on his pinion. Not any protector May make merry man faring needy. This he little believes, who aye in winsome life Abides 'mid burghers some heavy business, Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft Must bide above brine. Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north, Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now The heart's thought that I on high streams The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone. Moaneth alway my mind's lust That I fare forth, that I afar hence Seek out a foreign fastness. For this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst, Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed; Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare Whatever his lord will. He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight Nor any whit else save the wave's slash, Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water. Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries, Fields to fairness, land fares brisker, All this admonisheth man eager of mood, The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks On flood-ways to be far departing. Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying, He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow, The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not-- He the prosperous man--what some perform Where wandering them widest draweth. So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock, My mood 'mid the mere-flood, Over the whale's acre, would wander wide. On earth's shelter cometh oft to me, Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer, Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly, O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow My lord deems to me this dead life On loan and on land, I believe not That any earth-weal eternal standeth Save there be somewhat calamitous That, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain. Disease or oldness or sword-hate Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body. And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after-- Laud of the living, boasteth some last word, That he will work ere he pass onward, Frame on the fair earth 'gainst foes his malice, Daring ado,... So that all men shall honour him after And his laud beyond them remain 'mid the English, Aye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast, Delight mid the doughty. Days little durable, And all arrogance of earthen riches, There come now no kings nor Cæsars Nor gold-giving lords like those gone. Howe'er in mirth most magnified, Whoe'er lived in life most lordliest, Drear all this excellence, delights undurable! Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth. Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low. Earthly glory ageth and seareth. No man at all going the earth's gait, But age fares against him, his face paleth, Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions, Lordly men are to earth o'ergiven, Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth, Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry, Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart, And though he strew the grave with gold, His born brothers, their buried bodies Be an unlikely treasure hoard.

460,(A.C.S.),"One after one they leave thee, High Priest of Iacchus, Intoning thy melodies as winds intone The whisperings of leaves on sunlit days. And the sands are many And the seas beyond the sands are one In ultimate, so we here being many Are unity; nathless thy compeers, Knowing thy melody, Lulled with the wine of thy music Go seaward silently, leaving thee sentinel O'er all the mysteries, High Priest of Iacchus. For the lines of life lie under thy fingers, And above the vari-coloured strands Thine eyes look out unto the infinitude Of the blue waves of heaven, And even as Triplex Sisterhood Thou fingerest the threads knowing neither Cause nor the ending, High Priest of Iacchus, Draw'st forth a multiplicity Of strands, and, beholding The colour thereof, raisest thy voice Towards the sunset, O High Priest of Iacchus! And out of the secrets of the inmost mysteries Thou chantest strange far-sourced canticles: O High Priest of Iacchus! Life and the ways of Death her Twin-born sister, that is life's counterpart, And of night and the winds of night; Silent voices ministering to the souls Of hamadryads that hold council concealèd In streams and tree-shadowing Forests on hill slopes, O High Priest of Iacchus, All the manifold mystery Thou makest a wine of song, And maddest thy following even With visions of great deeds And their futility, O High Priest of Iacchus! Though thy co-novices are bent to the scythe Of the magian wind that is voice of Persephone, Leaving thee solitary, master of initiating Mænads that come through the Vine-entangled ways of the forest Seeking, out of all the world, Madness of Iacchus, That being skilled in the secrets of the double cup They might turn the dead of the world Into pæans, O High Priest of Iacchus, Wreathed with the glory of thy years of creating Entangled music, Breathe! Now that the evening cometh upon thee, Breathe upon us, that low-bowed and exultant Drink wine of Iacchus, that since the conquering Hath been chiefly containèd in the numbers Of them that, even as thou, have woven Wicker baskets for grape clusters Wherein is concealèd the source of the vintage, O High Priest of Iacchus, Breathe thou upon us Thy magic in parting! Even as they thy co-novices, At being mingled with the sea, While yet thou madest thy canticles Serving upright before the altar That is bound about with shadows Of dead years wherein thy Iacchus Looked not upon the hills, that being Uncared for, praised not him in entirety. O High Priest of Iacchus, Being now near to the border of the sands Where the sapphire girdle of the sea Encinctureth the maiden Persephone, released for the spring, Look! Breathe upon us The wonder of the thrice encinctured mystery Whereby thou being full of years art young, Loving even this lithe Persephone That is free for the seasons of plenty; Whereby thou being young art old And shalt stand before this Persephone Whom thou lovest, In darkness, even at that time That she being returned to her husband Shall be queen and a maiden no longer, Wherein thou being neither old nor young Standing on the verge of the sea Shalt pass from being sand, O High Priest of Iacchus, And becoming wave Shalt encircle all sands, Being transmuted through all The girdling of the sea.

512,PREFATORY NOTE,"They are reprinted here for good fellowship; for good custom, a custom out of Tuscany and of Provence; and thirdly, for convenience, seeing their smallness of bulk; and for good memory, seeing that they recall certain evenings and meetings of two years gone, dull enough at the time, but rather pleasant to look back upon.
