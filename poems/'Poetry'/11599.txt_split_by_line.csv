23,,Preface
24,,
25,,
26,,
27,,These pages were not written for public inspection; but to beguile the
28,,"weary hours of indisposition, and present a record of thoughts and"
29,,"sentiments to the eyes of my children, after my lips are sealed in"
30,,death.
31,,
32,,"By the recommendation of friends, I have decided to submit them to the"
33,,public.
34,,
35,,From a criticising public I should shrink; but to a sympathizing
36,,"public I would appeal, trusting the holy mantle of charity will be"
37,,"flung over my errors, and my motives appreciated."
38,,
39,,I would take this opportunity to tender my hearty and sincere thanks
40,,"to my patrons, who have aided me in this enterprise, not only by their"
41,,"subscriptions, but by their words of sympathy and encouragement, which"
42,,"have fallen like sunshine upon my gloomy pathway, warming my desolate"
43,,"heart, and leaving a sweet fragrance upon the memory, which shall live"
44,,"on and on, through the long ages of eternity; for beautifully and"
45,,"emphatically has Mrs. Childs said,"
46,,
47,,"""Goodness and beauty live forever,"""
48,,
49,,Perhaps I should apologise for the pensive strain in which I have
50,,"written, but it has been in shady places, when the body was suffering"
51,,"from disease, and I felt almost too weak to breathe. Dear reader, did"
52,,you ever feel that you were dying? that there was but a step between
53,,"you and death? How natural, at such a time, and in such a place, to"
54,,"contemplate the circumstances connected with the deaths of dear,"
55,,departed friends.
56,,
57,,"Hoping this may lead some thoughtless one to reflection, I submit it"
58,,to the investigation of a generous public.
59,,
60,,"But if I fail in this, shall I have written in vain? O, no; it is but"
61,,"a fulfilment in part of the great mission, ""do with all thy might"
62,,"what thy hand findeth to do."" If we have but one small talent we are"
63,,"commanded to put it upon usury, ""that the Lord may receive his own"
64,,"when he cometh."""
65,,
66,,"Some pieces were contributions from the pen of a loved sister, whose"
67,,"sentiments and principles are in unison with my own, and so they flow"
68,,"on together, in one common channel. Those designated by a star (*) in"
69,,"the Index, are from her pen."
70,,
71,,"On page 141, near the bottom, the paragraph which now reads, ""You did"
72,,"not expect me to be found alone now, did you?"" should read, ""You did"
73,,"not expect to find me _alive_ now,"" &c."
74,,
75,,"On page 272, in the 11th line from the top, in the word ""rugg'd,"" the"
76,,letter _e_ should be substituted for the apostrophe.
77,,
78,,"These errors escaped attention in reading the proof, before it went to"
79,,press.
80,,
81,,"When autumn winds are round us sighing,--"
82,,"When pale flowers are 'round us dying,"
83,,"It pain and pleasure to us gives,"
84,,To gather up the wither'd leaves.
85,,
86,,The year so tasteful flung her flow'rs
87,,"In garlands gay, o'er sylvan bow'rs;"
88,,But where they hung:--so brief--
89,,Now only hangs the wither'd leaf.
90,,
91,,"Dear reader, thus to thee I come,"
92,,With tresses blossom'd for the tomb;
93,,"And offer what the season gives,--"
94,,My faded flow'rs--my WITHERED LEAVES.

324,WITHERED LEAVES.,
325,WITHERED LEAVES.,"To enter Memory's hidden cell,"
326,WITHERED LEAVES.,And bid the sentinel appear;
327,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Her strange, mysterious tales to tell,"
328,WITHERED LEAVES.,And wipe the dust from by-gone years.
329,WITHERED LEAVES.,
330,WITHERED LEAVES.,"To wander back down time's dark stream,"
331,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And from its margin pluck the flowers,"
332,WITHERED LEAVES.,"To twine them with the moon's pale beams,"
333,WITHERED LEAVES.,Then fling them over Memory's bow'rs.

339,WITHERED LEAVES.,
340,WITHERED LEAVES.,"We'll wander forth while others sleep,"
341,WITHERED LEAVES.,Fanned gently by the night wind's sigh
342,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And thus our midnight vigils keep,"

345,WITHERED LEAVES.,"We'll wander in the realms of thought,"

355,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Touched by fancy's magic spell,"
356,WITHERED LEAVES.,We'll conjure up the things of yore;
357,WITHERED LEAVES.,"From their cold chambers bring the dead,"

363,WITHERED LEAVES.,Their mystic visions cannot last.
364,WITHERED LEAVES.,
365,WITHERED LEAVES.,Then let us leave the world of dreams
366,WITHERED LEAVES.,Where shapes and shadows melt away;
367,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Bathe in salvation's cooling streams,"

384,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Come gentle reader, let us entwine arms with Memory, and wander back"
385,WITHERED LEAVES.,"through the avenues of life to childhood's sunny dell, and as we"
386,WITHERED LEAVES.,return more leisurely pluck the wild flowers that grow beside the
387,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pathway, and entwine them for Memory's garland, and inhale the"
388,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fragrance of by-gone years. O, there are rich treasures garnered up"
389,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in Memory's secret chambers, enclosed in the recesses of the soul, to"
390,WITHERED LEAVES.,spring into life at the touch of her magic wand. Here let us sit on
391,WITHERED LEAVES.,"this mossy stone, beneath this wide spread elm, and as its waving"
392,WITHERED LEAVES.,"branches fan our feverish cheeks, fold back the dim, misty curtains of"
393,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the past, the silent past, and hold communings with the years that are"
394,WITHERED LEAVES.,"gone. Listen to the murmur of yonder rippling stream, that breaks like"
395,WITHERED LEAVES.,"far off music upon the ear, and although half a century of years"
396,WITHERED LEAVES.,"have passed since I first stood upon its margin, and listened to its"
397,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dirge-like hum, no trace of age is left upon it. The silent years that"
398,WITHERED LEAVES.,"have swept over its surface, bearing away the generations of men, have"
399,WITHERED LEAVES.,left this stream sporting and dancing on in all the freshness of youth
400,WITHERED LEAVES.,and beauty.
401,WITHERED LEAVES.,
402,WITHERED LEAVES.,Here is the grassy knoll where we have stood tiptoe and reached our
403,WITHERED LEAVES.,tiny hands a little higher to catch the gorgeous butterfly that
404,WITHERED LEAVES.,"floated through summer air on silken wings, and then clapped them with"
405,WITHERED LEAVES.,"joyous glee at our own disappointment, as it sailed higher up into the"
406,WITHERED LEAVES.,blue air.
407,WITHERED LEAVES.,
408,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then came the song of the warbling bird, the hum of the mountain bee,"
409,WITHERED LEAVES.,and the rustling of the leaves as they were stirred by the gentle
410,WITHERED LEAVES.,"summer breeze,--all making sweet melody in Nature's many voiced"
411,WITHERED LEAVES.,harmonies.
412,WITHERED LEAVES.,
413,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Here we have sat for hours, wrapt in dreamy reverie, wondering why the"
414,WITHERED LEAVES.,"long, fleecy clouds that chased each other over the sun, should cast"
415,WITHERED LEAVES.,"such deep, broad shadows over so fair a landscape; little heeding that"
416,WITHERED LEAVES.,they were emblematical of the shadows that coming years would cast
417,WITHERED LEAVES.,upon our pathway as we passed on in the journey of human life; but
418,WITHERED LEAVES.,"oh, how often has the sun of hope been dimmed by the shadows of"
419,WITHERED LEAVES.,disappointment.
420,WITHERED LEAVES.,
421,WITHERED LEAVES.,But let us leave this sequestered spot and wander over other scenes
422,WITHERED LEAVES.,familiar to childhood's years.
423,WITHERED LEAVES.,
424,WITHERED LEAVES.,Beneath yon large reservoir of water that flashes in the sun beams as
425,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the summer winds heave its troubled bosom, formerly stretched out an"
426,WITHERED LEAVES.,"extensive meadow, where we used to stroll for amusement; or to gather"
427,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the rich, ripe strawberries that lay concealed beneath the thick,"
428,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tall grass that sighed before the breeze like the bosom of the ocean,"
429,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fanned by the winds of heaven. Here, too, we gathered sweet blue"
430,WITHERED LEAVES.,"violets, yellow buttercups, Ladies' traces and London pride, with all"
431,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the beautiful variety of simple meadow flowers, and entwined them into"
432,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pretty wreaths, or fragrant boquets. But the touch of time has rested"
433,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon this spot, and his finger has left a deep impress upon it. The"
434,WITHERED LEAVES.,sloping hills that surround it remain the same. The trees bear some
435,WITHERED LEAVES.,"traces of decay, but here stand the thorn bushes that used to scatter"
436,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their showers of white blossoms around us like descending snow-flakes,"
437,WITHERED LEAVES.,"still filled with green leaves and small red apples, surrounded by the"
438,WITHERED LEAVES.,prickly thorns that to all appearances are the same that we grasped
439,WITHERED LEAVES.,fifty years ago.
440,WITHERED LEAVES.,
441,WITHERED LEAVES.,The sand-hills where the juvenile part of the neighborhood used to
442,WITHERED LEAVES.,"congregate to celebrate the happy twilight hour in merry sports, have"
443,WITHERED LEAVES.,literally passed away; having been shovelled up and transported to
444,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the various places for many miles around, where the multiplicity of"
445,WITHERED LEAVES.,"chimnies mark the increasing population of the village, that passing"
446,WITHERED LEAVES.,years have added to it.
447,WITHERED LEAVES.,
448,WITHERED LEAVES.,As we pass the antiquated moss-covered bars that admit us into the
449,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dear old orchard, and cross the little brook that bubbles on forever"
450,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in the same monotonous sound, requiring but one smooth round stepping"
451,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stone for a bridge, we sigh and feel that the change of years is upon"
452,WITHERED LEAVES.,"us, for here almost every thing speaks of decay. True the hills, the"
453,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ponds, the rocks (and I had almost said the speckled tortoise that has"
454,WITHERED LEAVES.,"crawled up to sun itself on their summit), remain the same."
455,WITHERED LEAVES.,
456,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Sit down on this dilapidated trunk, for the burden of years is upon"
457,WITHERED LEAVES.,"us; and as I glance upon this frame, I can scarcely realize it is the"
458,WITHERED LEAVES.,same form that used to impress this spot with childish footprints.
459,WITHERED LEAVES.,"This trunk was then a beautiful, stately tree, bearing its leafy"
460,WITHERED LEAVES.,"honors thick upon it, and laden with delicious golden fruit. But the"
461,WITHERED LEAVES.,"glory of the orchard has departed, and why should we linger any longer"
462,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in its confines, as it only awakens sad memories, and says in an"
463,WITHERED LEAVES.,"audible voice,"
464,WITHERED LEAVES.,
465,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Chance and change are busy ever."""
466,WITHERED LEAVES.,
467,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The carriage road that passes through it, almost blinding us with"
468,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dust, was formerly a well beaten foot-path for the accommodation of"
469,WITHERED LEAVES.,the neighborhood as they walked from one part of it to the other.
470,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Let us follow the road up this steep aclivity, and enter the large"
471,WITHERED LEAVES.,"capacious door-yard which contained several rods of land, and was"
472,WITHERED LEAVES.,"surrounded by an old fashioned stone wall, which has been beaten by at"
473,WITHERED LEAVES.,least seventy-five winters' storms; and the thick covering of green
474,WITHERED LEAVES.,moss upon it bespeaks its age.
475,WITHERED LEAVES.,
476,WITHERED LEAVES.,The west end was crossed by a fence containing a small strip of land
477,WITHERED LEAVES.,for the purpose of raising early summer vegetables. Here now is
478,WITHERED LEAVES.,erected the splendid dwelling house of one of the wealthiest citizens
479,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the village, and the garden is converted into front yard, building"
480,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spot and back yard, containing all the usual necessary appendages to"
481,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a dwelling place, so that here all traces of former days have passed"
482,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from the spot, and only live inscribed upon the retentive tablet of"
483,WITHERED LEAVES.,Memory. On the east end was another small enclosure where we used to
484,WITHERED LEAVES.,spend our leisure hours in the cultivation of flowers and medicinal
485,WITHERED LEAVES.,plants. Here the tall lilac waved its graceful head beneath our
486,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bed-room window, and the morning sun, as he parted the rosy curtains"
487,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the eastern sky and came forth rejoicing to run his glad race, and"
488,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pour a flood of golden light upon the earth, shot his first crimson"
489,WITHERED LEAVES.,rays upon the thick curtains of morning glories that hung clustering
490,WITHERED LEAVES.,"over our window, fragrant with their verdant leaves, and rich purple"
491,WITHERED LEAVES.,"blossoms, and causing the dew-drops to glisten like sparkling"
492,WITHERED LEAVES.,"diamonds, while the sweet odors of many scented flowers were borne"
493,WITHERED LEAVES.,upon every passing breeze. But could we now recognize this spot? oh
494,WITHERED LEAVES.,"no! the destroyer has been there, and there remains no trace of herb"
495,WITHERED LEAVES.,"or flower; an ell has been built on to that end of the house, and the"
496,WITHERED LEAVES.,"barn has been moved, so that our beautiful garden has been transformed"
497,WITHERED LEAVES.,"into a door yard, and all traces of beauty are obliterated. Crossing"
498,WITHERED LEAVES.,the garden you next entered upon a large level lot covered with the
499,WITHERED LEAVES.,richest grass that annually used to fall before the sythe of the
500,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mower, and descended by sloping hills to the above mentioned luxuriant"
501,WITHERED LEAVES.,meadow; through which ran a quiet winding stream that used to afford
502,WITHERED LEAVES.,"us an abundance of speckled trout and shining pickerel, to say nothing"
503,WITHERED LEAVES.,about the many play hours spent upon its margin; but now the stream
504,WITHERED LEAVES.,"is lost beneath the vast reservoir, and has washed away all traces"
505,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of flowers, strawberries and verdant grass that used to mark its"
506,WITHERED LEAVES.,"serpentine wanderings, by assuming a deeper green."
507,WITHERED LEAVES.,
508,WITHERED LEAVES.,The west end of this enclosure was intersected by what used to be
509,WITHERED LEAVES.,"called Virginia fence, then crossed into two separate places dividing"
510,WITHERED LEAVES.,"one into a sheep-pasture, the other into a large garden for the"
511,WITHERED LEAVES.,cultivation of winter vegetables. In the pasture used to graze a large
512,WITHERED LEAVES.,"flock of sheep, and the snowy lambs sported over the rocks and ran"
513,WITHERED LEAVES.,down the hillside; does this remain the same?
514,WITHERED LEAVES.,
515,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The rocks have been removed out of their places, and in their stead"
516,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dwelling houses have been erected, and the busy hum of active life"
517,WITHERED LEAVES.,"there resounds, and the prattling of children is heard instead of the"
518,WITHERED LEAVES.,bleating of lambs.
519,WITHERED LEAVES.,
520,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Crossing the stream upon the remains of an old dam, and passing the"
521,WITHERED LEAVES.,"extent of meadow, we entered upon a rich clover field, adjoining which"
522,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was the corn field, that in autumn used to be laden with yellow"
523,WITHERED LEAVES.,corn and golden pumpkins. Contiguous to this was a delightful grove
524,WITHERED LEAVES.,"composed of thrifty walnut trees, carefully cleared from under brush"
525,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and covered with verdant grass, and ornamented here and there with a"
526,WITHERED LEAVES.,"grassy hillock, that rendered it a pleasant retreat from the scorching"
527,WITHERED LEAVES.,rays of the summer sun. The air was filled with the notes of the
528,WITHERED LEAVES.,feathered songsters that built their nests and warbled in their
529,WITHERED LEAVES.,"branches, mingling their music with the rustling leaves and the murmur"
530,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the distant spring that rippled near, for a gradual descent brought"
531,WITHERED LEAVES.,"us down to the spring lot, which, with the grove and the swamp that"
532,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lay below, was used for pasturage. But let us pause and take a survey"
533,WITHERED LEAVES.,of its present appearances. The beautiful trees have all fallen
534,WITHERED LEAVES.,"before the woodman's axe, not one remaining as a link with their past"
535,WITHERED LEAVES.,history; the old fence has been removed that divided it from the
536,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cornfield, and surrounded by a new and beautiful one, it now forms a"
537,WITHERED LEAVES.,"part of a commodious Cemetery, is laid out into tasteful lots as the"
538,WITHERED LEAVES.,last resting place of the dead.
539,WITHERED LEAVES.,
540,WITHERED LEAVES.,Sweet spot; methinks it is meet for the weary children of earth to
541,WITHERED LEAVES.,slumber in this quiet place.
542,WITHERED LEAVES.,
543,WITHERED LEAVES.,"At its foot gurgles the quiet winding stream, and far away comes"
544,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the din and hum of active life, thronged with the busy crowd whose"
545,WITHERED LEAVES.,restless feet are bearing them swiftly on to the end of life's
546,WITHERED LEAVES.,"journey, where they must resign the cumbrous load and ""join the pale"
547,WITHERED LEAVES.,"caravan in the realms of shade."""
548,WITHERED LEAVES.,
549,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Descending from the grove on the western side, was a low, swampy piece"
550,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of ground, that had never yielded to cultivation, where we sometimes"
551,WITHERED LEAVES.,used to jump from one hillock to another in search of swamp pinks and
552,WITHERED LEAVES.,cheeses which were to be found there in great abundance.
553,WITHERED LEAVES.,
554,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was ever covered with low brush, of natural growth, and apparently"
555,WITHERED LEAVES.,"no change had passed over it from its creation, save the natural"
556,WITHERED LEAVES.,"springing up and decaying of its productions. And so, almost fifty"
557,WITHERED LEAVES.,"years ago, we left it, but how does it meet us upon our return? Art"
558,WITHERED LEAVES.,has touched it with her handy work. It has been drained; the brush cut
559,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from its surface, rich loam carted upon it, and now it presents the"
560,WITHERED LEAVES.,"appearance of a well cultivated garden, is covered with luxuriant"
561,WITHERED LEAVES.,"grass, and staked out into yards for the accommodation of families who"
562,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wish to lie down side by side, in the sleep of death. Many, already,"
563,WITHERED LEAVES.,"are beautified with flowers and shrubbery; and in some, already arises"
564,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the marble slab, pointing to the place where some weary pilgrim"
565,WITHERED LEAVES.,"reposes, free from all the earth calls good or great; for this, too,"
566,WITHERED LEAVES.,is enclosed in the Cemetery.
567,WITHERED LEAVES.,
568,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But passing the entrance into the Cemetery, we will pass back by a"
569,WITHERED LEAVES.,"circuitous route, to the dear old home. The road, the hills, the"
570,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rocks, the trees, and many of the buildings are the same; but, oh, how"
571,WITHERED LEAVES.,"many and varied are the changes that strike the eye, and awaken in"
572,WITHERED LEAVES.,the breast ten thousand bewildering remembrances. Truly has the human
573,WITHERED LEAVES.,"heart been compared to a many stringed instrument, giving diversity of"
574,WITHERED LEAVES.,sound as it is swept by different winds.
575,WITHERED LEAVES.,
576,WITHERED LEAVES.,"One of the most conspicuous changes, is the withdrawal of a large pond"
577,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of water that had been pent up by a high dam, over which the water"
578,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fell, over the bridge we are now crossing, roaring, casting up spray,"
579,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and then foaming and dancing off, into the meadow below."
580,WITHERED LEAVES.,
581,WITHERED LEAVES.,Many of the buildings have changed their old fashioned coats of red
582,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for the more modern one of white, which is the case with our own old"
583,WITHERED LEAVES.,"homestead. Opposite the house, or across the way, as we used to call"
584,WITHERED LEAVES.,"it (for the road was between), stood, what was ever called, the woods."
585,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Here, in their season, we gathered the largest whortleberries, the"
586,WITHERED LEAVES.,"best walnuts, and the nicest black birch that were to be found all"
587,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the country round. And when we had wearied our limbs, and filled our"
588,WITHERED LEAVES.,"baskets, how often have we pulled over the tops of the smaller trees,"
589,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and seating ourselves upon some slender branch, enjoyed a real"
590,WITHERED LEAVES.,"juvenile ride upon horseback, each one having a particular tree"
591,WITHERED LEAVES.,designated by the name of a horse.
592,WITHERED LEAVES.,
593,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Immediately opposite the house, stood a high hill, composed of jagged"
594,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rocks, behind which the sun ever sank to his cosy bed in the west, and"
595,WITHERED LEAVES.,where I have watched the forked lightning play as the blackened cloud
596,WITHERED LEAVES.,"gathered together, ominous of a portending storm, while the distant"
597,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thunder murmured behind their eternal summit. This stands the same,"
598,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and as you glance down the other side, you see the broad, black"
599,WITHERED LEAVES.,"river, still rolling at its base. But the woods--the bright green"
600,WITHERED LEAVES.,"woods--where are they? Echo answers, ""where?"" Supplanting the place"
601,WITHERED LEAVES.,"is a young thrifty orchard, and at the base of the hill is a finely"
602,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cultivated piece of land, and there is nothing but the everlasting"
603,WITHERED LEAVES.,hills to tell us of the dear spot where we wandered in the halcyon
604,WITHERED LEAVES.,days of childhood; we cannot even exclaim with Cowper--
605,WITHERED LEAVES.,
606,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I sat on the trees under which I had played."""
607,WITHERED LEAVES.,
608,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Dear old trees! methinks, even now, I can hear your music, when fanned"
609,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by the summer breeze, or see you toss your surging branches, when"
610,WITHERED LEAVES.,rocked by the autumnal gale. Well do I remember your cooling shade as
611,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I walked beneath it to the district school house, which was situated"
612,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in one corner of the dear old orchard. There, too, has been a change;"
613,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the rocks upon which we used to play have been blown to atoms, and the"
614,WITHERED LEAVES.,"habitations of men occupy their places. Truly, all things are passing"
615,WITHERED LEAVES.,away!
616,WITHERED LEAVES.,
617,WITHERED LEAVES.,
618,WITHERED LEAVES.,
619,WITHERED LEAVES.,
620,WITHERED LEAVES.,Chapter II.
621,WITHERED LEAVES.,
622,WITHERED LEAVES.,The Old House.
623,WITHERED LEAVES.,
624,WITHERED LEAVES.,
625,WITHERED LEAVES.,
626,WITHERED LEAVES.,"We have crossed the threshold and entered the dear old house. Back,"
627,WITHERED LEAVES.,"back, these tumultuous throbbings of the heart, and these tears which"
628,WITHERED LEAVES.,"vainly rising to the eyelids, fall back upon the heart as wanting"
629,WITHERED LEAVES.,"power to flow. Who, after an absence of many years, on entering the"
630,WITHERED LEAVES.,"house where they first inhaled the breath of life, but has been"
631,WITHERED LEAVES.,"overpowered by conflicting emotions, as the tide of Memory rolled"
632,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in, like a flood, bearing so much upon its bosom, and where so many"
633,WITHERED LEAVES.,"associations crowd upon the mind, it is difficult to lend expression"
634,WITHERED LEAVES.,to the ideas.
635,WITHERED LEAVES.,
636,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The interior of the house has not been materially changed, except"
637,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the additional ell, which contains a kitchen, pantry, and such like"
638,WITHERED LEAVES.,conveniences for progressing household labor; the kitchen being
639,WITHERED LEAVES.,"transformed into a sitting room, with no change, excepting a new coat"
640,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of paint, large windows instead of small, paper instead of bare walls,"
641,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and a place for a stove pipe instead of the ample fire place, that"
642,WITHERED LEAVES.,used to shed its cheering light and warmth over the whole room. And
643,WITHERED LEAVES.,"we might almost fancy ourselves at home, were it not that the eyes of"
644,WITHERED LEAVES.,"strangers are upon us, and we miss the dear familiar faces that first"
645,WITHERED LEAVES.,taught the infant heart to love.
646,WITHERED LEAVES.,
647,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Here, have we clustered around the knees of a mother and drank rich"
648,WITHERED LEAVES.,"instruction from her pious lips, and offered up the morning and the"
649,WITHERED LEAVES.,"evening prayer, and lisped our hymn of praise, while she ever strove"
650,WITHERED LEAVES.,to impress the golden rule upon the young and tender minds committed
651,WITHERED LEAVES.,to her care; and her example was ever that of a consistent Christian.
652,WITHERED LEAVES.,
653,WITHERED LEAVES.,"How vividly comes up before the eye of Memory, the forms of the aged"
654,WITHERED LEAVES.,members of the family; for there were an uncle and two aunts of my
655,WITHERED LEAVES.,"father who were never married, that took him at the early age of two"
656,WITHERED LEAVES.,"years, educated him and gave him the homestead for his patrimony; and"
657,WITHERED LEAVES.,at the time of my birth the snow of many winters rested upon their
658,WITHERED LEAVES.,"heads, and the infirmities of age were upon them."
659,WITHERED LEAVES.,
660,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was their delight to watch our childish sports, listen to our"
661,WITHERED LEAVES.,"innocent prattle, and strive to direct our young footsteps in the"
662,WITHERED LEAVES.,paths of virtue. They have passed away like the shadows of a passing
663,WITHERED LEAVES.,cloud. Almost my first recollections of death are associated with that
664,WITHERED LEAVES.,of the aged man. He had been sick about four days when we were called
665,WITHERED LEAVES.,to stand by his bedside and witness his departure. He smiled upon the
666,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dear little brother, mother held in her arms, shook him by the hand,"
667,WITHERED LEAVES.,gave us all a parting glance; the film of death then gathered upon his
668,WITHERED LEAVES.,"eyes, a convulsive shudder ran over his frame, and a deathly paleness"
669,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rested upon his countenance, filling our young hearts with wonder and"
670,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dismay. As we felt the marble coldness of his stiffened limbs, and saw"
671,WITHERED LEAVES.,"him borne away to the silent grave, we learned the first lesson from"
672,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the pale messenger, and felt the awful void that his presence creates"
673,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in the family circle, and which we have since been called so often to"
674,WITHERED LEAVES.,experience. He died in the very room where we first opened our eyes
675,WITHERED LEAVES.,upon the light.
676,WITHERED LEAVES.,
677,WITHERED LEAVES.,It is a large gloomy looking room. The two windows looking out upon
678,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the north, and a door opening out upon the level field, covered with"
679,WITHERED LEAVES.,"its carpet of green, intersected by neither shrub nor trees. The"
680,WITHERED LEAVES.,"coating of paint is changed, and the walls neatly papered, which is"
681,WITHERED LEAVES.,the only change it has undergone.
682,WITHERED LEAVES.,
683,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Adjacent to this is the east bedroom, one window looking out upon the"
684,WITHERED LEAVES.,"north, and one upon the little garden at the east end of the house."
685,WITHERED LEAVES.,"This room, for many years, was our lodging room, where we sought--"
686,WITHERED LEAVES.,
687,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Tired nature's sweet restorer balmy sleep,"""
688,WITHERED LEAVES.,
689,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and lost ourselves in the world of dreams. Many, very many, were the"
690,WITHERED LEAVES.,waking dreams that filled the imagination as the map of life lay
691,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spread out before fancy's witching gaze, and hope illuminated it with"
692,WITHERED LEAVES.,her brilliant rainbow dyes. No waves of passion or disappointment
693,WITHERED LEAVES.,"moved its surface. But, oh, how different has been the reality!"
694,WITHERED LEAVES.,
695,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Crossing the small entry opposite the kitchen is a large room,"
696,WITHERED LEAVES.,formerly occupied by the old people. The same change is visible in
697,WITHERED LEAVES.,"this as in the other rooms. Here, day after day, sat our aged aunt,"
698,WITHERED LEAVES.,"reading the word of God or her favorite hymns, and seeking preparation"
699,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for death (for she was fourscore and ten years old), and had been a"
700,WITHERED LEAVES.,"member of the church of Christ from her nineteenth year, spending a"
701,WITHERED LEAVES.,"long life to his honor and glory. It was the winter of the year, but"
702,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a mild day, when on returning from school we were summoned to her"
703,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bedside. The feeble lamp of life was flickering in the socket, and the"
704,WITHERED LEAVES.,pulses of the aged woman stood still. Her spirit passed quietly from
705,WITHERED LEAVES.,"earth, to enter into the presence of God who gave it. She fell like a"
706,WITHERED LEAVES.,"shock of corn fully ripe, at the age of ninety-four years. There was"
707,WITHERED LEAVES.,"no struggle; wearied nature resigned her burden without resistance,"
708,WITHERED LEAVES.,and the countenance was pleasant in death. She was borne to the
709,WITHERED LEAVES.,"graveyard and laid by the side of her dear brother, and thus they"
710,WITHERED LEAVES.,were again united in the place of graves; and again there were vacant
711,WITHERED LEAVES.,"places in our family circle, for many had been the attentions we were"
712,WITHERED LEAVES.,"obliged to bestow upon our aged relative, for she had been unable to"
713,WITHERED LEAVES.,walk for several years.
714,WITHERED LEAVES.,
715,WITHERED LEAVES.,"In this apartment two windows opened to the south, and one at the west"
716,WITHERED LEAVES.,"end of the house, looking out upon the woods; on the north side three"
717,WITHERED LEAVES.,"doors opened, one into a bedroom with one west window, one into a"
718,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pantry or dairy room, where stood long rows of pans of milk covered"
719,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with golden cream, and tempting cheeses arrayed, the shelves. Here"
720,WITHERED LEAVES.,"there is slight alteration, excepting the shelves and ceiling have"
721,WITHERED LEAVES.,"changed their snowy whiteness for a coating of blue paint, and instead"
722,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of a dairy room, it is converted into a common pantry. The other door"
723,WITHERED LEAVES.,"led into the winter cellar, where we used to go for the nice apples,"
724,WITHERED LEAVES.,"which formed the usual accompaniment of a winter evening. Oh, those"
725,WITHERED LEAVES.,pleasant evenings! what heeded we that the wintry storm raged without?
726,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Our evening meal was always dispatched, and the household duties all"
727,WITHERED LEAVES.,performed before the evening shadows fell around us. The fire burned
728,WITHERED LEAVES.,"brightly upon the clean swept hearth, shedding a cheerful glow over"
729,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the room, while warming by its blaze stood a large dish of red and"
730,WITHERED LEAVES.,"golden apples, temptingly arranged. Before the fire stood a small"
731,WITHERED LEAVES.,"round table, round which the younger members of the family were"
732,WITHERED LEAVES.,"seated, braiding straw, while some one read aloud from some useful or"
733,WITHERED LEAVES.,"entertaining book; or we pursued our favorite studies, and prepared"
734,WITHERED LEAVES.,the school lesson for the coming day (for we could braid and study at
735,WITHERED LEAVES.,the same time).
736,WITHERED LEAVES.,
737,WITHERED LEAVES.,How profitable and how pleasant were those evenings! As I look back
738,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon them, through the long lapse of years that have passed away, and"
739,WITHERED LEAVES.,"recall each familiar' face and tone, I feel that those hours were"
740,WITHERED LEAVES.,among the happiest of my life. Many of those dear forms have passed
741,WITHERED LEAVES.,"away from earth forever. The dear mother, who presided over us with so"
742,WITHERED LEAVES.,"much affection, mingling in our pleasures and soothing our pains, has"
743,WITHERED LEAVES.,finished her course upon earth and gone to her reward; but may the
744,WITHERED LEAVES.,good seed sown in the hearts of her children spring up and bear fruit
745,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to eternal life. Although her lips are now silent in death, she still"
746,WITHERED LEAVES.,"speaks to us, she still lives embalmed in the hearts of her children."
747,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Two dear brothers that enlivened those cheerful evenings, by acting"
748,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their part in the drama of life, have passed away, to"
749,WITHERED LEAVES.,
750,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""That bourne from which no traveller e'er returns,"""
751,WITHERED LEAVES.,
752,WITHERED LEAVES.,and their voices are heard no more upon earth.
753,WITHERED LEAVES.,
754,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But, usually, ere the family clock that ticked in the corner of the"
755,WITHERED LEAVES.,"room struck nine, all had retired to rest and all was silent, save the"
756,WITHERED LEAVES.,ticking of the clock or the howling of the wintry storm.
757,WITHERED LEAVES.,
758,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Deaths in our neighborhood were not of very common occurrence, and"
759,WITHERED LEAVES.,used to fill our young hearts with dismay; and for many long weeks I
760,WITHERED LEAVES.,used to count the number of nights the new occupant of a grave had
761,WITHERED LEAVES.,"slept in it, and shudder as I thought of all the gloom, the darkness"
762,WITHERED LEAVES.,and the silence of the narrow house; and felt sad when I reflected
763,WITHERED LEAVES.,that all men must die. Faith then had not lifted her trusting eye
764,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beyond the portals of the tomb, or illuminated its confines by the"
765,WITHERED LEAVES.,glorious light of the gospel. And when in the winter of 1816 a fatal
766,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fever raged, and the angel of death flapped his broad wings over our"
767,WITHERED LEAVES.,"little village, and one after another was cut suddenly down by his"
768,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stealthy darts, we could hardly realize that it was directed by the"
769,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hand of a merciful God, and, collected together in a little group,"
770,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wondered, in our childish innocence, ""who would go next?"""
771,WITHERED LEAVES.,
772,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Here, upon this door-step, have we sat for hours, in all suitable"
773,WITHERED LEAVES.,"seasons of the year, looking out upon the prospect, and contemplating"
774,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the changing seasons, or the alternate sun and shade that rested upon"
775,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the face of nature. Often have we wandered forth, while the dew was"
776,WITHERED LEAVES.,"yet upon the grass, to gather a basket of the large red cheeked"
777,WITHERED LEAVES.,peaches that had fallen from the trees during the night. Near by stood
778,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a noble pear tree, laden with rich orange pears, covering the ground"
779,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beneath with its golden treasures, while a contiguous apple tree"
780,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mingled its store of bright red apples in rich profusion. O, it was a"
781,WITHERED LEAVES.,"delicious blending of autumn's garnered store, showered upon the lap"
782,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of Mother Nature, spread out temptingly to the eyes of her weary"
783,WITHERED LEAVES.,"children. But the trees have departed with the ""dark brown years,"""
784,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that have flung their dim shadows over them--nor root, nor branch"
785,WITHERED LEAVES.,remains.
786,WITHERED LEAVES.,
787,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A few years passed, and by one of the unforeseen changes that occur in"
788,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the lives of business men, we were obliged to relinquish our childhood"
789,WITHERED LEAVES.,"home, and go forth to try the rougher usage of the world in a land of"
790,WITHERED LEAVES.,"strangers. Sad were the feelings that filled our young hearts, as we"
791,WITHERED LEAVES.,"went forth from the dear place, with which was associated all the"
792,WITHERED LEAVES.,"earliest recollections of life, and the endearing ideas of home. The"
793,WITHERED LEAVES.,"evening before our departure, we ascended the top of the highest"
794,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hill that over-looked our little villa, accompanied by our young"
795,WITHERED LEAVES.,"schoolmates, to watch the declining rays of the setting sun, and"
796,WITHERED LEAVES.,"promised eternal friendship to each other. It was Sabbath day--a calm,"
797,WITHERED LEAVES.,delightful Sabbath day--that was now closing upon us; and as the sun
798,WITHERED LEAVES.,"finished his journey across the horizon, and sank behind the far-off"
799,WITHERED LEAVES.,"western hills, methinks the sacred tranquility that reigned around"
800,WITHERED LEAVES.,"seemed to be whispering to the troubled spirit, ""Peace, be still."" But"
801,WITHERED LEAVES.,"could we, with our youthful hearts weighed down by this great grief,"
802,WITHERED LEAVES.,could we heed the gentle whispers? surely not; and we felt that like
803,WITHERED LEAVES.,"our first parents, we were about to be driven from Paradise. We sat"
804,WITHERED LEAVES.,"conversing upon the past, and forming plans for the future,"
805,WITHERED LEAVES.,
806,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Till twilight grey had in her sober livery all things clad."""
807,WITHERED LEAVES.,
808,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Descending the hill we sought our homes, and early the following"
809,WITHERED LEAVES.,"morning found us pursuing our way to a land of strangers, leaving"
810,WITHERED LEAVES.,"behind us home, friends, and the burying place of our fathers, which"
811,WITHERED LEAVES.,we had ever looked upon as our last resting place.
812,WITHERED LEAVES.,
813,WITHERED LEAVES.,"While the waves of time have borne year after year away, each one"
814,WITHERED LEAVES.,"replete with change, we have been tossing upon the stream till we"
815,WITHERED LEAVES.,"again stand in the same place from which we then departed, and while"
816,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the grief of that hour is fresh in the memory, we will again turn"
817,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sadly away from the spot teeming with so many remembrances, and where"
818,WITHERED LEAVES.,"were instilled the first principles of virtue and religion. O, may"
819,WITHERED LEAVES.,"these remain and grow ""brighter and brighter unto the perfect day,"""
820,WITHERED LEAVES.,"while all mutable things decay. Dear old house, farewell; these"
821,WITHERED LEAVES.,eyes may never again behold you; these feet never again cross your
822,WITHERED LEAVES.,"threshold; but while reason remains, the memory of these haunts will"
823,WITHERED LEAVES.,be tenderly cherished. And so we pass again from the spot with an
824,WITHERED LEAVES.,"aching heart, and leave it to the possession of strangers."

832,WITHERED LEAVES.,
833,WITHERED LEAVES.,
834,WITHERED LEAVES.,
835,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But while we yet linger on this sacred spot, will enter into the"
836,WITHERED LEAVES.,school house where our young footsteps first attempted to climb the
837,WITHERED LEAVES.,hill of Science. The outward appearance is the same. A pretty one
838,WITHERED LEAVES.,"story and a half building, painted yellow with white trimmings, and a"
839,WITHERED LEAVES.,"chocolate colored door, which is reached by two stone steps."
840,WITHERED LEAVES.,
841,WITHERED LEAVES.,"You are then admitted into a large hall, accommodated with shelves for"
842,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the convenience of the scholars, and as we pass through this and enter"
843,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the school-room, we feel almost a child again. But we see at a glance"
844,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that our dear old teacher does not occupy the desk, and it is a"
845,WITHERED LEAVES.,stranger's voice that strikes upon the ear. As we glance at the
846,WITHERED LEAVES.,"well-filled seats, we readily perceive there is not one of all the"
847,WITHERED LEAVES.,"group, no, not one, that occupied those seats when we were scholars"
848,WITHERED LEAVES.,there. But we will sit calmly down upon the teacher's desk and recall
849,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the dim shadowy forms of the past, the by-gone past. The breeze that"
850,WITHERED LEAVES.,"passes through the open window and fans the brow, might be mistaken"
851,WITHERED LEAVES.,for the same playful zephyr that sported with our own silken locks in
852,WITHERED LEAVES.,"childhood, as we stood before this same open window. The monotonous"
853,WITHERED LEAVES.,hum of the school-room seems the same and the drowsy buzz of the
854,WITHERED LEAVES.,summer fly as it floats on azure wings brings to the ear a well
855,WITHERED LEAVES.,"remembered sound, and we press our hand tightly upon our eyes and try"
856,WITHERED LEAVES.,to think we are living over again years that are passed. It will not
857,WITHERED LEAVES.,"do, there is a change--we must acknowledge that change. The teacher"
858,WITHERED LEAVES.,"who so long presided in this place, was a stern man, of commanding"
859,WITHERED LEAVES.,"figure, with a high, broad forehead and piercing black eyes, coal"
860,WITHERED LEAVES.,"black hair and beard, with rather a handsome countenance, although"
861,WITHERED LEAVES.,"nothing could ever provoke a smile upon it in school hours, and he"
862,WITHERED LEAVES.,governed his pupils more by fear than love. But the lesson must be
863,WITHERED LEAVES.,"perfectly committed and correctly recited, or the offending culprit"
864,WITHERED LEAVES.,"must fall under his severe displeasure, and this was a situation that"
865,WITHERED LEAVES.,few in the school were willing to be placed in. I have heard of this
866,WITHERED LEAVES.,"man's death, but in what manner or where I know not; but many are"
867,WITHERED LEAVES.,the lessons I have heard fall from his lips which still live in my
868,WITHERED LEAVES.,"heart--have had their impress upon the life, and will continue to"
869,WITHERED LEAVES.,exist through the boundless ages of eternity. And now that the
870,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thoughtlessness of youth has passed away, here, upon this spot, would"
871,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I offer a grateful tribute to his memory. Many others, too, occupied"
872,WITHERED LEAVES.,"this place, of whose destiny I am entirely ignorant, but yet remember"
873,WITHERED LEAVES.,them with much affection.
874,WITHERED LEAVES.,
875,WITHERED LEAVES.,"One female teacher in particular, under whose instruction I sat six"
876,WITHERED LEAVES.,"summers in succession. Then she was young and healthful, and happy in"
877,WITHERED LEAVES.,the bosom of her family; but now all have passed away save this one
878,WITHERED LEAVES.,"surviving branch. She alone remains of her family, in feeble health,"
879,WITHERED LEAVES.,and with that depression of spirits incident upon her situation.
880,WITHERED LEAVES.,
881,WITHERED LEAVES.,"On the low seat next to the desk, used to sit rather a fragile child,"
882,WITHERED LEAVES.,with bright red hair and deep blue eyes that had a depth of meaning in
883,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their earnest gaze. Her seat was vacant, and we heard, that Elizabeth"
884,WITHERED LEAVES.,Ann was sick with typhus fever. We visited her in her chamber. She lay
885,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tossing from side to side, upon her bed, even gnawing her fingers for"
886,WITHERED LEAVES.,"very pain. I gazed upon her with pity, and they told me she must die."
887,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I had seen the aged pass away, but never the young. And musing long"
888,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and sadly upon this event, I sought my home, and spent a restless"
889,WITHERED LEAVES.,"night, repeating often the childish hymn, commencing,"
890,WITHERED LEAVES.,
891,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I in the burying place may see"
892,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Graves shorter there than I."""
893,WITHERED LEAVES.,
894,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But the long night passed away with its sad presages, and the rising"
895,WITHERED LEAVES.,sun peeped between the thick clustering leaves and flowers of the
896,WITHERED LEAVES.,"morning glories that shaded the window, and diffused light and"
897,WITHERED LEAVES.,"radiance upon the joyous landscape. The birds awoke to new melody, and"
898,WITHERED LEAVES.,in the gladness that surrounded me I almost forgot the impressions of
899,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the previous evening. I arose, though slightly refreshed, repeating as"
900,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I did so,"
901,WITHERED LEAVES.,
902,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""So like the sun may I fulfil"
903,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The duties of the day."""
904,WITHERED LEAVES.,
905,WITHERED LEAVES.,Almost the first intelligence that greeted my ear was the death of
906,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Elizabeth Ann Prince. While the shadows of that night still lingered,"
907,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her pure spirit had passed away, and for the first time I realized"
908,WITHERED LEAVES.,"more fully than I had ever done before, that youth is no protection"
909,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from death. I saw her in her small coffin, and felt the marble"
910,WITHERED LEAVES.,"coldness of her pale brow, and as I saw the coffin descend into the"
911,WITHERED LEAVES.,"narrow grave, I turned sadly away with a grief-stricken, and perchance"
912,WITHERED LEAVES.,a better heart. But for many months I could tell the exact number of
913,WITHERED LEAVES.,nights she had lain buried in the silent grave.
914,WITHERED LEAVES.,
915,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The next morning as I took my seat with a favorite companion, in"
916,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the one behind that formerly occupied by her, I almost started as I"
917,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fancied that her face was upturned to mine, and those blue orbs rested"
918,WITHERED LEAVES.,upon me.
919,WITHERED LEAVES.,
920,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The dear friend that sat with me, has too, passed away, ""and the"
921,WITHERED LEAVES.,"places that knew her once upon earth, now know her no more forever."""
922,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Rosa was an orphan, having lost both parents; she was the youngest"
923,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of four sisters, had an amiable disposition, and was an affectionate"
924,WITHERED LEAVES.,"friend. She was married to a wealthy man, and became the mother of"
925,WITHERED LEAVES.,several children; but the destroyer came and bore her from her dear
926,WITHERED LEAVES.,"family to the silent church-yard, and placed her beneath a grassy"
927,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mound beside her father and her mother. Sweet is thy memory, friend of"
928,WITHERED LEAVES.,"my early days, and very pleasant were the hours we spent together: but"
929,WITHERED LEAVES.,"they have passed away with the things that were, and like the rose"
930,WITHERED LEAVES.,"leaves that falling fill the air with their perfume, so the fragrance"
931,WITHERED LEAVES.,of those hours still lives.
932,WITHERED LEAVES.,
933,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Next to Rosa Whittier sat Julia Balcolm, with saddened expression of"
934,WITHERED LEAVES.,countenance and large deep blue eyes that gazed upon you with a deeper
935,WITHERED LEAVES.,expression of melancholly in their glances than is usual to the merry
936,WITHERED LEAVES.,"age of childhood, and elicited your sympathy ere you knew her history."
937,WITHERED LEAVES.,Julia was a cripple. She was drawn to school by an older sister with
938,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rosy cheeks, bright flashing black eyes, and a sprightly animated"
939,WITHERED LEAVES.,"countenance, and carried into the school-room in the arms of her"
940,WITHERED LEAVES.,"teacher, or some of the older scholars. And so she came, year after"
941,WITHERED LEAVES.,"year, mingling with the merry group. But where is she now? yon little"
942,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mound of heaped up earth covers her remains, and a narrow marble slab"
943,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tells the place of her repose, and we can but hope she who was denied"
944,WITHERED LEAVES.,the privilege of walking on earth may now soar on angel's wings.
945,WITHERED LEAVES.,
946,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As we contemplate the deprivations of one situated as she was, we can"
947,WITHERED LEAVES.,"but realize the blessing of having ""the common use of our own limbs."""
948,WITHERED LEAVES.,This dear child was obliged to crawl from place to place after her
949,WITHERED LEAVES.,"more favored companions, dragging her useless perished limbs behind"
950,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her. But he who careth for us knew what was best for her, and we"
951,WITHERED LEAVES.,cannot doubt his infinite wisdom.
952,WITHERED LEAVES.,
953,WITHERED LEAVES.,It were vain to endeavor to trace the destinies of all who used to sit
954,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with us, in this favorite, place. Many have gone down to death--many"
955,WITHERED LEAVES.,still live on the same premises where they first inhaled the breath
956,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of life, and some have gone forth into the world to fulfil a darker"
957,WITHERED LEAVES.,"destiny on the broad ocean of human life, that is ever tossing its"
958,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tumultuous waves before the tempestuous winds of fortune, and have"
959,WITHERED LEAVES.,been ship-wrecked upon the quick-sands of vice and dissipation. The
960,WITHERED LEAVES.,shady side of the picture has been presented; but those were bright
961,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and joyous days, and our school-yard resounded with the merry laugh"
962,WITHERED LEAVES.,and frolicsome mirth of childhood; yet they leave not that abiding
963,WITHERED LEAVES.,impression upon the mind that characterizes incidents of a more
964,WITHERED LEAVES.,sombre hue. But we will leave the dear old school house with all its
965,WITHERED LEAVES.,"treasured memories that link it with the past, and pursue our way in"
966,WITHERED LEAVES.,some other direction. It is hard to stop where so many images crowd
967,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the mind, and come stealing upon us in the shape of old familiar"
968,WITHERED LEAVES.,"friends with whom we have walked side by side, day after day; but dear"
969,WITHERED LEAVES.,"familiar scenes, adieu."

982,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stage, have laid them down in the sleep of death. Many are the changes"
983,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that meet the eye as we pass along, but there are many traces left"
984,WITHERED LEAVES.,that awaken memories of past friends and past years. Here are the dear
985,WITHERED LEAVES.,old trees under which we have played; the rocks upon which we have
986,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sat, and the stream on which we have sailed; but which now is greatly"

993,WITHERED LEAVES.,
994,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Our fathers, where are they?"""

996,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Methinks the stones at our feet cry out--""All flesh is grass."""
997,WITHERED LEAVES.,
998,WITHERED LEAVES.,This is an ancient burial place; and as we look upon the dates of the
999,WITHERED LEAVES.,"headstones, how forcibly do we feel ""one generation passeth away and"
1000,WITHERED LEAVES.,"another generation cometh."" Many of the monuments have ceased to be a"
1001,WITHERED LEAVES.,"memorial; having crumbled away, and the inscriptions become entirely"
1002,WITHERED LEAVES.,obliterated by the thick covering of green moss that has gathered upon
1003,WITHERED LEAVES.,them. Is not this a lesson that is calculated to humble the pride of
1004,WITHERED LEAVES.,"man? But we will pause by the graves of the dear uncle and aunt, whose"
1005,WITHERED LEAVES.,"remains we saw deposited here many years ago, when our young footsteps"
1006,WITHERED LEAVES.,bounded with all the elasticity of childhood. But though sweeping
1007,WITHERED LEAVES.,"years have borne away the halcyon days of childhood, the golden days"
1008,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of youth, and the sobered and subdued period of middle life, and"
1009,WITHERED LEAVES.,our sun has passed its meridian and is verging rapidly towards
1010,WITHERED LEAVES.,"its setting, still this grief comes back again with all its first"
1011,WITHERED LEAVES.,freshness. Here for the first time these eyes looked into an
1012,WITHERED LEAVES.,untenanted grave; for the first time saw the coffin let down into the
1013,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""dark and narrow house,"" and heard the hollow sound as the earth fell"
1014,WITHERED LEAVES.,upon it--and deep was the impression that was made upon the childish
1015,WITHERED LEAVES.,"memory, and so faithful is she to her trust that at this moment, when"
1016,WITHERED LEAVES.,"standing upon this spot, she brings it back again, untarnished by the"
1017,WITHERED LEAVES.,long years that have passed away. The little heaped up mound that
1018,WITHERED LEAVES.,"covered their remains has sunk to a level with its kindred dust,"
1019,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and the inscriptions upon the headstones, though legible, are much"
1020,WITHERED LEAVES.,"defaced. Can it be that here are the dear forms whose voices I heard,"
1021,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon whose knees I sat, and who led me by the hand, day after day?"
1022,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Even so. Were it not for revelation, ""that light and immortality are"
1023,WITHERED LEAVES.,"brought to light"" by the gospel, how dark would be the grave; who"
1024,WITHERED LEAVES.,"could fathom its mysterious confines, or penetrate its darkness? But"
1025,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the Saviour has shed a radiance around it, and assured us ""the graves"
1026,WITHERED LEAVES.,shall give up their dead; that we shall all come forth and be judged
1027,WITHERED LEAVES.,"according to the deeds done in the body."" Happy they, who learn"

1033,WITHERED LEAVES.,"adjoining grave, seems the gentle whisper of departed spirits, wooing"
1034,WITHERED LEAVES.,us to the skies. As we glance far off in the distance from this
1035,WITHERED LEAVES.,"elevated spot, we see the toil and turmoil of life--its struggles,"
1036,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cares and disappointments, and then contemplating the scene around us,"
1037,WITHERED LEAVES.,"we feel that, this must be the end of all who live. Here lie those for"
1038,WITHERED LEAVES.,whom we sought in vain in the places where we formerly knew them. Here
1039,WITHERED LEAVES.,"repose the remains of our family physician, who, for many years, was"
1040,WITHERED LEAVES.,"called in all cases of sickness, and was like a brother in the family."
1041,WITHERED LEAVES.,By his side sleeps his amiable wife; as we look upon their graves for
1042,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the first time, we remember them as they were in life, and heave a"
1043,WITHERED LEAVES.,sigh to their memory.
1044,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1045,WITHERED LEAVES.,Here lies a school companion who died at a very early age; we had
1046,WITHERED LEAVES.,won prizes and received our little books from the hands of our dear
1047,WITHERED LEAVES.,"teacher, and that is my only recollection of him. His seat was vacant,"
1048,WITHERED LEAVES.,and they told me he was dead; but then I knew nothing of death.
1049,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1050,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Here, too, are the graves of Elizabeth Ann Prince, Julia Balcolm, the"
1051,WITHERED LEAVES.,"poor cripple, and many others, who have sat with me in the dear"
1052,WITHERED LEAVES.,old school house. One in particular strikes the mind with peculiar
1053,WITHERED LEAVES.,solemnity. It is the grave of Edward Davis; he was a young man of
1054,WITHERED LEAVES.,"superior talents, uncommon beauty and prepossessing manners. He was"
1055,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rich in this world's goods, and married an amiable young lady, in all"
1056,WITHERED LEAVES.,"respects his equal; they lived happily together several years, and had"
1057,WITHERED LEAVES.,"several children, but sickness came like a blight upon him, and he was"
1058,WITHERED LEAVES.,"soon conveyed to the silent tomb, leaving his wife and children to"
1059,WITHERED LEAVES.,mourn his loss.
1060,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1061,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Here, side by side, are the graves of an entire household, consisting"
1062,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the maternal grandmother, two sisters of the father, the father"
1063,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and mother, and seven children, with the wife of one of the sons. Not"
1064,WITHERED LEAVES.,twelve rods from their own door they sleep side by side--that many
1065,WITHERED LEAVES.,"voiced household, in the silence of death. No voice breaks the"
1066,WITHERED LEAVES.,stillness; no words of love are interchanged; but their dust shall
1067,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mingle together till the morning of the resurrection, teaching an"
1068,WITHERED LEAVES.,impressive lesson to those that stand by their graves and read the
1069,WITHERED LEAVES.,inscriptions upon their tombstones.
1070,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1071,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Here is buried the dear old deacon and his wife, by whose bedside we"

1075,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And even then came, ""let me die the death of the righteous, and let my"

1080,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Clara Everett was a promising young girl, cut down at the early age of"

1083,WITHERED LEAVES.,She was tenderly cared for by her maternal grand-parents and a maiden
1084,WITHERED LEAVES.,"aunt, well educated and had commenced teaching, when she was seized"
1085,WITHERED LEAVES.,"suddenly with an alarming fever, which in a few short days, was"
1086,WITHERED LEAVES.,terminated by death. They bore her to the resting place with many
1087,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tears, and placed her beside those dear parents from whom she was so"
1088,WITHERED LEAVES.,"early separated. Many here, that lived a life of dissipation, have"

1096,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1097,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Here is buried an aged woman, who lived in poverty. She had the"
1098,WITHERED LEAVES.,"shaking palsy, and it was with great difficulty she could perform"
1099,WITHERED LEAVES.,any labor; she was assisted by the town and the charities of the
1100,WITHERED LEAVES.,"neighborhood. She had one daughter, who was an invalid many years,"
1101,WITHERED LEAVES.,and dependant upon the care of the feeble mother. The children of

1105,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beneath the sod. The daughter is buried by her side, and methinks they"
1106,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sleep as sweetly as the more wealthy citizen, beneath a more splendid"
1107,WITHERED LEAVES.,"monument. All here meet upon a common level--the old, the young,"
1108,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the rich, the poor, the bond and free, for death is no respecter of"
1109,WITHERED LEAVES.,persons.
1110,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1111,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Here, too, rests a young physician, who supplied the place of the old"
1112,WITHERED LEAVES.,"one. His career was like the meteor flash, emitting its brilliant rays"
1113,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for a season, and then was shrouded in death's dark night."
1114,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1115,WITHERED LEAVES.,As we stand upon this spot and contemplate it as it was when we last
1116,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stood upon it, we feel that here has been the greatest change of any"
1117,WITHERED LEAVES.,"place yet visited. Here we meet many a name familiar to the ear, and a"
1118,WITHERED LEAVES.,"form familiar to the eye starts into life, and treads again its mazy"
1119,WITHERED LEAVES.,"scenes. Many monuments are erected to entire strangers, and this"
1120,WITHERED LEAVES.,is our first meeting with them. Here the infant of a few days lies
1121,WITHERED LEAVES.,"buried, just tasting the cup of life, he turned sickening away, and"
1122,WITHERED LEAVES.,"yielding it up, soared away with the angel band to the realms of"
1123,WITHERED LEAVES.,bliss.
1124,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1125,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But ere we leave the yard, let us visit the resting place of the"
1126,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beautiful Clarinda Robinson, who died at the early age of nineteen."
1127,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She had ever enjoyed undiminished health. But soon, oh, how soon,"
1128,WITHERED LEAVES.,the rose of health faded upon her cheek; her sparkling eye lost its
1129,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lustre, and the animated form, stiffened in death, was laid away in"
1130,WITHERED LEAVES.,"its silent chamber. At her feet lie two beautiful nieces, called, too,"
1131,WITHERED LEAVES.,in the morning of their days to go and make their beds with her. Sadly
1132,WITHERED LEAVES.,did the bereaved mother mourn their loss; but the pale messenger came
1133,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for her too, in a few weary years, and she joined them in the pale"
1134,WITHERED LEAVES.,realms of shade.
1135,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1136,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Here, too, sleeps the young wife, called soon away from the husband of"
1137,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her youth. Consumption, like a worm in the bud, preyed upon the"
1138,WITHERED LEAVES.,"damask of her cheek, dried up the fountain of her life, and bore her"
1139,WITHERED LEAVES.,"triumphantly, another victim of his power. The old sexton, too, who"
1140,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from time immemorial, had been"
1141,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1142,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""The maker of the dead man's bed,"""
1143,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1144,WITHERED LEAVES.,"has laid down his mattock and his spade, and filled a grave prepared"
1145,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by other hands. At his feet lies a lovely daughter, snatched suddenly"
1146,WITHERED LEAVES.,"away, ere the bloom of youth had passed, and almost without a moment's"
1147,WITHERED LEAVES.,"warning, leaving a husband and a dear little child, too young to feel"
1148,WITHERED LEAVES.,its loss.
1149,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1150,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But while we have yet lingered, the sun has finished his journey, and"
1151,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hid his bright beams behind the curtain of the west, and already have"
1152,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the shadows of coming twilight gathered around us, and the white"
1153,WITHERED LEAVES.,"marble slabs, dimly seen in its shadows, assume strange, mysterious"
1154,WITHERED LEAVES.,"shapes, and seem almost like moving things of life, while the darker"
1155,WITHERED LEAVES.,slate are lost to view.
1156,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1157,WITHERED LEAVES.,We will sit a moment on the grave of our dear old aunt. This was the
1158,WITHERED LEAVES.,spot designated for our family burying place; but it is now filled
1159,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with strangers. We will now leave this spot, to toss again upon the"
1160,WITHERED LEAVES.,"waves of time; but may the lesson here learned go with us, and prepare"
1161,WITHERED LEAVES.,"us for the day when the heart and flesh shall fail, and we must change"

1494,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Until his gentle slumber passed,"
1495,WITHERED LEAVES.,Then clasp'd him fondly to her breast.
1496,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1497,WITHERED LEAVES.,Childhood's brief years in sin were spent;
1498,WITHERED LEAVES.,The stubborn knee ne'er bent in prayer;
1499,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Those lips ne'er spake a Saviour's name,"
1500,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Our Father"" never lingered there."
1501,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1502,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Youth's golden season, too, was passed"
1503,WITHERED LEAVES.,In wanton sports and misspent time;
1504,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And soon he stood on manhood's verge,"
1505,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A hardened wretch, prepared for crime."
1506,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1507,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Though so forbidding in his mein,"
1508,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He woo'd and won a gentle bride,"
1509,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Who but the closer to him clung,"
1510,WITHERED LEAVES.,As darker rolled life's heaving tide.
1511,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1512,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But though an Angel shar'd the place,"
1513,WITHERED LEAVES.,There were for him no joys at home;
1514,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He left his mother and his wife,"
1515,WITHERED LEAVES.,Reckless o'er earth or sea to roar.
1516,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1517,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He stood upon a sanded deck,"
1518,WITHERED LEAVES.,"With blood-red pennon floating free,"
1519,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And with a daring bloody band,"
1520,WITHERED LEAVES.,Rode madly o'er the foaming sea.
1521,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1522,WITHERED LEAVES.,The waves that lashed the coal-black hull
1523,WITHERED LEAVES.,Were parted oft their dead to hide;
1524,WITHERED LEAVES.,"For ocean's surging, billowy foam,"
1525,WITHERED LEAVES.,Drank deeply of life's crimson tide.
1526,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1527,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He tossed a pointed dagger high,"
1528,WITHERED LEAVES.,And wore a sabre by his side;
1529,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And many a gen'rous noble one,"
1530,WITHERED LEAVES.,Beneath his powerful arm had died.
1531,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1532,WITHERED LEAVES.,"For bloody deeds of daring high,"
1533,WITHERED LEAVES.,He had won a deathless fame;
1534,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And o'er that reckless, bloody crew,"
1535,WITHERED LEAVES.,Had gained a pirate-captain's name.
1536,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1537,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And though their coffers teem'd with gold,"
1538,WITHERED LEAVES.,Their sordid souls still sighed for more:
1539,WITHERED LEAVES.,And to procure the paltry trash
1540,WITHERED LEAVES.,They scour'd the seas from shore to shore.
1541,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1542,WITHERED LEAVES.,But Retribution's hour must come;
1543,WITHERED LEAVES.,Vengeance cannot always sleep;
1544,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Justice, with her glittering sword,"
1545,WITHERED LEAVES.,Pursues them swiftly o'er the deep.
1546,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1547,WITHERED LEAVES.,"At midnight, in a dungeon lone,"
1548,WITHERED LEAVES.,An aged female knelt in prayer;
1549,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But oh, her low, sepulchral tone"
1550,WITHERED LEAVES.,Seemed fraught with anguish and despair.
1551,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1552,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""My son,"" she cried, ""to morrow's sun"
1553,WITHERED LEAVES.,Must witness your disgraceful death;
1554,WITHERED LEAVES.,"O, seek a dying Saviour's love,"
1555,WITHERED LEAVES.,E'en with your expiring breath.
1556,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1557,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The sun of Righteousness has risen,"
1558,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And o'er my path shed golden light,"
1559,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And shone upon the narrow way,"
1560,WITHERED LEAVES.,That ever followed leads aright.
1561,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1562,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And I have followed to the cross,"
1563,WITHERED LEAVES.,"On which a dying Saviour hung,"
1564,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Bemoaned my sins with weeping eyes,"
1565,WITHERED LEAVES.,Besought his grace with suppliant tongue.
1566,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1567,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He witness'd all my sorrowing tears,"
1568,WITHERED LEAVES.,And heard my suppliant prayer in Heaven;
1569,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then sweetly spake with cheering voice,"
1570,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Daughter, thy sins are all forgiven."""
1571,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1572,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Prostrate in dust before His throne,"
1573,WITHERED LEAVES.,My heart's pure worship then I gave;
1574,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Sweetly my ransomed spirit sang,"
1575,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Jesus Christ has power to save."""
1576,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1577,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then spake the son:--""Talk not to me,"
1578,WITHERED LEAVES.,I heeded not weak woman's tears;
1579,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But when I sail'd upon the sea,"
1580,WITHERED LEAVES.,I quickly silenc'd all their fears.
1581,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1582,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Free was my trade, my arm was free,"
1583,WITHERED LEAVES.,And human blood I freely spilt;
1584,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And many an aged breast like thine,"
1585,WITHERED LEAVES.,Has sheath'd my dagger to its hilt.
1586,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1587,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Our blood-red pennon floated free,"
1588,WITHERED LEAVES.,Our blood-stained deck its witness gave;
1589,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Blood, human blood, was on our hands,"
1590,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And mingled oft with ocean's wave."""
1591,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1592,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Shudd'ring, the mother cried: ""My son,"
1593,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Though you are steeped in human gore,"
1594,WITHERED LEAVES.,"There is a fountain filled with blood,"
1595,WITHERED LEAVES.,That can your purity restore.
1596,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1597,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Your Angel wife bath'd in that flood,"
1598,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And proved a Saviour's promise true,"
1599,WITHERED LEAVES.,And when she gently pass'd from earth
1600,WITHERED LEAVES.,She left her dying love for you;
1601,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1602,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And bade you seek a Saviour's face,"
1603,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And by His mercy be forgiven,"
1604,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And by that new and living way,"
1605,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Seek an inheritance in Heaven."""
1606,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1607,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Then she is dead,"" he mournful cried,"
1608,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""'Tis better thus, for see the sun"
1609,WITHERED LEAVES.,With rosy light now streaks the east:
1610,WITHERED LEAVES.,And ere it sets my race is run.
1611,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1612,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Firm would I stand upon the drop,"
1613,WITHERED LEAVES.,Meet firmly my approaching doom;
1614,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But death is not an endless sleep,"
1615,WITHERED LEAVES.,And justice lives beyond the tomb.
1616,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1617,WITHERED LEAVES.,Yet this conviction comes too late;
1618,WITHERED LEAVES.,"My soul is lost,--I cannot pray;"
1619,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Forget your son--forget my fate,"
1620,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And walk in wisdom's pleasant way."""
1621,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1622,WITHERED LEAVES.,In agony the mother pressed
1623,WITHERED LEAVES.,To her sad heart her guilty son;
1624,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But yet, like incense from that heart,"
1625,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Sweetly arose, ""thy will be done."""
1626,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1627,WITHERED LEAVES.,No hands were folded on his breast.
1628,WITHERED LEAVES.,They laid him not within the tomb;
1629,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The surgeon took him from the drop,"
1630,WITHERED LEAVES.,To meet a more disgraceful doom.
1631,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1632,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And such is life, whose ebb and flow"
1633,WITHERED LEAVES.,Heaves the deep sea of human mind;
1634,WITHERED LEAVES.,"True happiness they only know,"
1635,WITHERED LEAVES.,Whose every wish's to Heaven resigned.
1636,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1637,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1638,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1639,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1640,WITHERED LEAVES.,The History of a Household.
1641,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1642,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1643,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Early in the winter of 18--, there was a heavy rain, accompanied by"
1644,WITHERED LEAVES.,"high winds, which swelled the waters of the Sandy river to an amazing"
1645,WITHERED LEAVES.,"height, and every moving thing upon its surface was borne away with"
1646,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the rapidity of lightning. Standing upon its margin was Frank Somers,"
1647,WITHERED LEAVES.,his eyes fixed with intense interest upon a frail raft that was
1648,WITHERED LEAVES.,plunging and heaving among the boiling waves. Upon it stood a man
1649,WITHERED LEAVES.,"about the middle of life, with an athletic form and a determined"
1650,WITHERED LEAVES.,"expression of countenance, his eyes fixed fiercely upon a brace of"
1651,WITHERED LEAVES.,"logs that had been left reposing on the quiet bosom of the waters,"
1652,WITHERED LEAVES.,"waiting their turn to be sawed into boards. It was a valuable lot,"
1653,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and would bring considerable of an income to the owner, therefore he"
1654,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pursued it over the rapid current, hoping to arrest its course ere"
1655,WITHERED LEAVES.,"it reached the falls. Beside him stood a young boy on the raft,"
1656,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his cheeks blanched to marble whiteness, and his dark eyes fixed"
1657,WITHERED LEAVES.,imploringly upon his father as they danced along over the furious
1658,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wave, every bound conveying them so much nearer the falls that"
1659,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thundered on like a mighty cataract, heaving up a cloud of spray, then"
1660,WITHERED LEAVES.,"foaming and dashing off to join the mad waters below. O, it was a"
1661,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fearful sight. On, on went the logs, and on, on went the raft, the"
1662,WITHERED LEAVES.,reckless man exerting himself to his utmost to stop their progress by
1663,WITHERED LEAVES.,endeavoring to reach them with a long pole he held in his hand.
1664,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1665,WITHERED LEAVES.,Willie Somers raised his pleading eyes to his face (and many long
1666,WITHERED LEAVES.,"years after did their expression haunt him), ""O Mr. Lambert, please"
1667,WITHERED LEAVES.,"don't go any farther, we shall be over the falls."""
1668,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1669,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Pshaw, child,"" answered Mr. Lambert, rather sternly, ""I must save my"
1670,WITHERED LEAVES.,"logs at any risk."""
1671,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1672,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The frantic father screamed from the shore,--""Mr. Lambert, save"
1673,WITHERED LEAVES.,yourselves and let the logs go.
1674,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1675,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""You are lost, you are lost!"" cried many voices, as a log bounded upon"
1676,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a giant wave, leaping over the cataract hurrying on through the waters"
1677,WITHERED LEAVES.,"below. The strong man made a desperate effort and reached the land,"
1678,WITHERED LEAVES.,but the poor boy upon the raft was precipitated over the falls into
1679,WITHERED LEAVES.,the gulf below. As the agonized father stood gazing with breathless
1680,WITHERED LEAVES.,"horror upon the sight, the form of his dear son arose once more,"
1681,WITHERED LEAVES.,"standing erect upon the bounding billows, with his arms widely"
1682,WITHERED LEAVES.,"extended, and his eyes glaring from their sockets. But in, a moment he"
1683,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was hid from view, beneath the heaving mass of waters. All effort to"
1684,WITHERED LEAVES.,find him proved unavailing.
1685,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1686,WITHERED LEAVES.,The next spring his body was found thirty miles distant down the
1687,WITHERED LEAVES.,"river, having laid in the water over three months. He was sent to his"
1688,WITHERED LEAVES.,"friends. The father was almost beside himself, although a man slow"
1689,WITHERED LEAVES.,to anger; but he turned when his son sank from his sight groaning in
1690,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spirit, and shut himself up in his chamber, not daring to see Mr."
1691,WITHERED LEAVES.,Lambert till his wrath was in some degree abated. He secluded himself
1692,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in his room four days, suffering intensely, and then went forth among"
1693,WITHERED LEAVES.,"men an altered man, for the fearful death of his son had made an"
1694,WITHERED LEAVES.,impression upon his mind never to be obliterated by time.
1695,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1696,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He was a man of sorrow, having separated from his family on account of"
1697,WITHERED LEAVES.,"domestic troubles, and this, his only son, was his greatest comfort."
1698,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1699,WITHERED LEAVES.,"His eldest daughter Matilda, was married to a man in the same"
1700,WITHERED LEAVES.,"neighborhood, and had been a witness of her brother's sudden death."
1701,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She was young in years, but insidious consumption was sapping the"
1702,WITHERED LEAVES.,"secret springs of life, and that awful sight gave her a shock from"
1703,WITHERED LEAVES.,which she never recovered. The wretched father soon left that part of
1704,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the country and journeyed to a far distant southern city, and far, far"
1705,WITHERED LEAVES.,"away in a land of strangers, they made his grave. No dear child was"
1706,WITHERED LEAVES.,"near to wipe the dew of death from his noble brow, or to minister to"
1707,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his necessities, or to close his weary eyes as they cast their sad"
1708,WITHERED LEAVES.,glances upon a world that had been to him a world of trial.
1709,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1710,WITHERED LEAVES.,Matilda gradually failed. She had given her heart with her hand in
1711,WITHERED LEAVES.,"early youth, to a young man of moderate circumstances, but prudent and"
1712,WITHERED LEAVES.,"industrious; and by these means they procured a comfortable living,"
1713,WITHERED LEAVES.,and with this they were contented. She united her industry with that
1714,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of her husband, and her good management gave a neat and almost an"
1715,WITHERED LEAVES.,"elegant appearance to their little cottage home, which peeped out like"
1716,WITHERED LEAVES.,a bird's nest from the trees that surrounded it. Charles Abbot was a
1717,WITHERED LEAVES.,"happy man, happy in the consciousness of well doing, happy in the love"
1718,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of his wife, and in the caresses of two little boys, the pledges of"
1719,WITHERED LEAVES.,their united love.
1720,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1721,WITHERED LEAVES.,They had been married six years when the death of the dear brother
1722,WITHERED LEAVES.,cast so deep a shadow over their hitherto happy home. Matilda's
1723,WITHERED LEAVES.,"failing health scarce attracted attention, it was so gradual."
1724,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1725,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A slight cough, a deeper rose upon the cheek, and a brighter fire in"
1726,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the eye, were almost its only indications. It was a calm evening in"
1727,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the early part of June, as Charles and Matilda sauntered forth to"
1728,WITHERED LEAVES.,inhale the sweet fragrance of the evening breeze that fanned the
1729,WITHERED LEAVES.,"leaves of the trees, and wafted the odors of many flowers upon its"
1730,WITHERED LEAVES.,"downy pinions, and rippling the now quiet waters of the Sandy river"
1731,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that lay in peaceful repose, its glassy surface reflecting the mild"
1732,WITHERED LEAVES.,radiance of the setting sun.
1733,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1734,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Before them ran their little children in all their sportive gaiety,"
1735,WITHERED LEAVES.,"clapping their hands with joyous glee, as they watched the progress of"
1736,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a little boat that was plying its way across the river, and listening"
1737,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to the boatman's whistle, and the splashing of the oar as it dipped"
1738,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the silver waves. The towering mountains rose high above their heads,"
1739,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and ""Father Abraham"" looked as though it were about to fall and crush"
1740,WITHERED LEAVES.,"them as they seated themselves at its base, to gaze upon the prospect"
1741,WITHERED LEAVES.,before them. Charles adjusted Matilda's shawl as she seated herself by
1742,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his side, with a sharp cough."
1743,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1744,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He glanced anxiously toward her, but became reassured as the deep"
1745,WITHERED LEAVES.,crimson upon her cheek and the bright sparkle of her eye met his gaze.
1746,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1747,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She sat looking pensively towards the river for some time, with her"
1748,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cheek resting upon her husband's shoulder, and occasionally watching"
1749,WITHERED LEAVES.,the many gambols of her children as they sported at their feet. At
1750,WITHERED LEAVES.,"length she said: ""Charles, how deceitful to me looks the placid bosom"
1751,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of yonder rippling stream, as it reposes in quiet beauty, reminding me"
1752,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the stream of time, on the ocean of human life when unmoved by the"
1753,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tumultuous storms of passion that so often agitate the human breast,"
1754,WITHERED LEAVES.,and cause the waves to rise and the billows to swell before the
1755,WITHERED LEAVES.,surging storm. Scarce six months have passed since that stream swept
1756,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by in giant fury, and poor Willie was buried in its angry bosom. O,"
1757,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Charles, do you know I cannot look upon that river without hearing"
1758,WITHERED LEAVES.,"again his last agonizing shriek, and seeing again his pale fearful"
1759,WITHERED LEAVES.,"gaze as he looked death in the face, for well must the dear boy have"
1760,WITHERED LEAVES.,"known that his doom was sealed; and oh, what agony must have filled"
1761,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his breast as he cast his last gaze upon us, imploring our assistance,"
1762,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and yet feeling it would be vain."""
1763,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1764,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""We will leave this place, as it awakens unpleasant memories."""
1765,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1766,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""It is best so,"" continued she; ""Even now the spirit of my dear"
1767,WITHERED LEAVES.,"brother seems hovering over me, whispering of the spirit land. But"
1768,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Charles, I have something to say to you of importance."""
1769,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1770,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The husband looked earnestly and tenderly into the face of his wife,"
1771,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and she continued,"
1772,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1773,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Perhaps, my dear husband, you are not aware of my failing health, but"
1774,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I feel the necessity of having assistance in my household duties, and"
1775,WITHERED LEAVES.,have thought perhaps it would be better to send for sister Ellen to
1776,WITHERED LEAVES.,"come and stay with me a while."""
1777,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1778,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Certainly, my dear, certainly; I will go after her to-morrow; forgive"
1779,WITHERED LEAVES.,"me, Matilda, that I have not thought of this before, but I think if"
1780,WITHERED LEAVES.,"you are relieved of part of your labor for a while, your health will"
1781,WITHERED LEAVES.,"improve."""
1782,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1783,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The poor wife smiled sadly, and pulling down a stalk laden with buds"
1784,WITHERED LEAVES.,from an adjacent rose bush that stood waving on a flowery bank beside
1785,WITHERED LEAVES.,"them, and pointing to a crimson bud enclosed in its casing of green,"
1786,WITHERED LEAVES.,"she said, ""Charles, is not that a beautiful bud?"""
1787,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1788,WITHERED LEAVES.,He looked at it and answered in the affirmative.
1789,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1790,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Do you think it will ever bloom?"""
1791,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1792,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I see no reason why it should not, it looks as promising as any one"
1793,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the stem."""
1794,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1795,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""But look a little closer, do you see that little worm gnawing at the"
1796,WITHERED LEAVES.,"very heart and sapping the secret springs of its life?"""
1797,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1798,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Her husband gazed tearfully upon her, and she felt she was understood;"
1799,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and then pressed her to his heart in a passionate, fond embrace, and"
1800,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spoke words of comfort, and of hope and of life."
1801,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1802,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The wife smiled faintly upon him, and replied:"
1803,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1804,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Even now there is such a weariness in my limbs that I do not feel as"
1805,WITHERED LEAVES.,"though I scarcely can reach our little cottage home, where we have"
1806,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spent so many happy hours together."""
1807,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1808,WITHERED LEAVES.,"They called their little Frank, who bore his grandfather's name, and"
1809,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Willie, for the youngest was named for her dear brother, and"
1810,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pursued their way silently to the house, each wrapped in their own"
1811,WITHERED LEAVES.,meditations.
1812,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1813,WITHERED LEAVES.,"That night, when Mr. Abbot closed his family Bible, and they all knelt"
1814,WITHERED LEAVES.,"together to implore God's mercy, fervent was the supplication that"
1815,WITHERED LEAVES.,"arose from the lips of the husband and father, as he besought grace"
1816,WITHERED LEAVES.,for every time of need. The heart of the husband was full as he
1817,WITHERED LEAVES.,"prayed our Father to stay the disease of his dear wife, and earnestly"
1818,WITHERED LEAVES.,"repeated, ""if it be possible let this cup pass from me;"" but after"
1819,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wrestling long, that peace came that passeth understanding--that peace"
1820,WITHERED LEAVES.,that the God that heareth prayer bestows upon his children when they
1821,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bow themselves before Him, and cast their burden upon Him who careth"
1822,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for us, and ere he arose from his knees he was made to say, ""Thy will,"
1823,WITHERED LEAVES.,"not mine be done;"" and they retired to rest beneath the shadow of the"
1824,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Almighty, and felt that his watchful eye was upon them during the"
1825,WITHERED LEAVES.,silent hours of the night.
1826,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1827,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Early the following morning Mr. Abbot started, to go down the river"
1828,WITHERED LEAVES.,"(as was the usual phrase) to Matilda's grandfather's, where Annie and"
1829,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Ellen, the two younger sisters resided, having both left the residence"
1830,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of their mother some time previous. Annie, then eighteen, had the sole"
1831,WITHERED LEAVES.,"management of the family, as her grandmother was very feeble, and"
1832,WITHERED LEAVES.,unable to assist her at all. She was rather surprised at Mr. Abbot's
1833,WITHERED LEAVES.,"arrival, and quite alarmed when she heard the import of it. It was"
1834,WITHERED LEAVES.,"immediately settled that Ellen should go with him, and preparation"
1835,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was accordingly made for their departure early the following morning,"
1836,WITHERED LEAVES.,"every thing being attended to by the careful Annie, who supplied the"
1837,WITHERED LEAVES.,"place of mother to the younger sister, who was now about sixteen."
1838,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1839,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Suffice it to say, the assistance was not productive of the"
1840,WITHERED LEAVES.,"anticipated good; Matilda's health declined rapidly, and it became"
1841,WITHERED LEAVES.,"evident to all who looked upon her, that she was passing away to the"
1842,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spirit land. The struggle in her husband's mind was over, and he felt"
1843,WITHERED LEAVES.,a pious resignation to the will of God.
1844,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1845,WITHERED LEAVES.,Frequently did they converse together upon the joys of the heavenly
1846,WITHERED LEAVES.,"world, and select such passages of Scripture as are calculated to"
1847,WITHERED LEAVES.,prepare the soul for its upward flight.
1848,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1849,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O Charles,"" said Matilda, one beautiful autumn day, as the yellow sun"
1850,WITHERED LEAVES.,"shed his mild radiance over the decaying face of nature, ""support me"
1851,WITHERED LEAVES.,by your strong arm while we pass through the garden to the river by
1852,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the nearest way. I feel quite refreshed to-day, and would look once"
1853,WITHERED LEAVES.,more upon that restless stream that is ever hurrying on 'to meet old
1854,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Ocean.'"""
1855,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1856,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He placed his arm lovingly round her waist, and almost bore her to the"
1857,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spot, scarcely feeling her weight, so fragile had she become. Frank"
1858,WITHERED LEAVES.,and Willie accompanied them with their happy countenances and glad
1859,WITHERED LEAVES.,"voices, and plucking a bunch of fading flowers, presented them to"
1860,WITHERED LEAVES.,their mother.
1861,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1862,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She watched them with a tranquil smile, and rewarded them with a kiss"
1863,WITHERED LEAVES.,as she took the proffered boquet from the uplifted hands of her dear
1864,WITHERED LEAVES.,"children. Frank was a noble boy, with dark brown hair and coal black"
1865,WITHERED LEAVES.,"eyes, inheriting his mother's beauty. Willie was a feeble child, with"
1866,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hair of lighter brown and eyes of azure blue, that betrayed a noble"
1867,WITHERED LEAVES.,soul in their very depths.
1868,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1869,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The mother called him to her, and taking his little hand in hers,"
1870,WITHERED LEAVES.,pressed them lightly to her forehead and then to her lips: looked
1871,WITHERED LEAVES.,earnestly into his eyes as though she would penetrate their very
1872,WITHERED LEAVES.,"depths, then tenderly said:"
1873,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1874,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Willie, we are very near to heaven here; it is the music of angels"
1875,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that whispers through the waving trees, and it is the motion of their"
1876,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wings that sways their branches so gently. O Willie, will you meet me"
1877,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in heaven?"""
1878,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1879,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Frank, come and kiss me; we are very near heaven; will you too meet"
1880,WITHERED LEAVES.,"your mother there? Charles, it does not make me sad now to see the"
1881,WITHERED LEAVES.,place where dear brother Willie passed over the falls. It looks
1882,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pleasant now, so near heaven, and his gentle spirit says, 'sweet"
1883,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sister, come;' surely the things of earth are passing away. Charles,"
1884,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the dear boys will comfort you when I am gone, and perchance my spirit"
1885,WITHERED LEAVES.,"may meet with yours in sweet communings, and soon we shall meet in"
1886,WITHERED LEAVES.,"heaven to spend an eternity together. Charles, pray in this beautiful"
1887,WITHERED LEAVES.,"place. O, those towering mountains apeak the majesty of their Creator."""
1888,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1889,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Ellen, dear, 'remember your Creator in the days of your youth;' and"
1890,WITHERED LEAVES.,"oh Charles, pray that we all may meet in heaven."""
1891,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1892,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He knelt and offered up the prayer of faith, but while he concluded,"
1893,WITHERED LEAVES.,"there was a pressure of the hand he held in his, the white lips"
1894,WITHERED LEAVES.,"parted, the head fell heavily upon his shoulder; there was a faint"
1895,WITHERED LEAVES.,"whisper ""Jesus, receive my spirit,"" and the mother was an Angel."
1896,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1897,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The boys were overcome with grief. Charles and Ellen too, were"
1898,WITHERED LEAVES.,awestruck.
1899,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1900,WITHERED LEAVES.,He bore his lovely burden back to the house and wrapped her in the
1901,WITHERED LEAVES.,habiliments of the grave.
1902,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1903,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was a mournful day in autumn, when a sad procession bore her to her"
1904,WITHERED LEAVES.,"last resting place, and laid her down by the side of her much lamented"
1905,WITHERED LEAVES.,"brother. The appropriate text, ""He that believeth on me shall never"
1906,WITHERED LEAVES.,"die,"" comforted the grief-stricken mourners. She passed away early in"
1907,WITHERED LEAVES.,"life, ere the sun of twenty-four summers had shone upon her pathway."
1908,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1909,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Charles mourned his loss, but not as one without hope. And as he"
1910,WITHERED LEAVES.,turned from the grave to his home and crushed the blighted leaves
1911,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of autumn beneath his feet, he felt that he too, was passing over"
1912,WITHERED LEAVES.,withered hopes back to the battle field of human life.
1913,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1914,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He cast one long, lingering glance upon Matilda's grave, then looked"
1915,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fervently to heaven, and pressed on to ""life and to duty with"
1916,WITHERED LEAVES.,"undismayed heart."""
1917,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1918,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Ellen soon returned to her grand-parents, and a sister of Mr. Abbot,"
1919,WITHERED LEAVES.,"losing her husband about the same time his wife died, came to reside"
1920,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with him, and thus the husband and children were provided for; and"
1921,WITHERED LEAVES.,"although the shadow of a great grief rested upon them, and there was"
1922,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a vacancy in their household, they learned to be happy in the present"
1923,WITHERED LEAVES.,"good, and by living so as to join the dear departed ones in a happier"
1924,WITHERED LEAVES.,world.
1925,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1926,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was again June--mild, lovely June. The air was filled with the"
1927,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sweet music of the birds that carolled their evening lay, and seemed"
1928,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pouring forth a sweet song of gratitude to Heaven, for that delightful"
1929,WITHERED LEAVES.,day. Gentle breezes sighed through the leafy trees soft as the first
1930,WITHERED LEAVES.,"whispering of young love, giving them a trembling motion, like a"
1931,WITHERED LEAVES.,bashful maiden as she blushingly listens to it. Beautiful looked the
1932,WITHERED LEAVES.,"little village of W----, as the setting sun cast his slanting rays"
1933,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon it, tinging the leaves with deeper green, and burnishing the"
1934,WITHERED LEAVES.,little stream with gems of sparkling gold. The tall lilac bushes were
1935,WITHERED LEAVES.,"filled with large red and white blossoms, and as they slightly nodded"
1936,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their graceful heads before the passing zephyr, might have been"
1937,WITHERED LEAVES.,fancied to be giving a cold greeting to some humbler flower that grew
1938,WITHERED LEAVES.,by their side.
1939,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1940,WITHERED LEAVES.,"In a large, square, old fashioned house, encircled by a neat white"
1941,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fence, which separated it from the street, might be seen a young girl,"
1942,WITHERED LEAVES.,occupied in what New England housewives would call setting the house
1943,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in order, and very carefully are all things arranged, the crockery"
1944,WITHERED LEAVES.,"being nicely washed and wiped to a shining brightness, stands neatly"
1945,WITHERED LEAVES.,"arranged in their proper places, on shelves scoured to a snowy"
1946,WITHERED LEAVES.,"whiteness. The floor is nicely swept, every chair carefully dusted,"
1947,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and set back in its proper place, and the broom and the brush hung"
1948,WITHERED LEAVES.,back upon their accustomed nail. The young mistress stood looking
1949,WITHERED LEAVES.,round the apartment with the air of one who feels they have
1950,WITHERED LEAVES.,"accomplished well the designated task, when she started upon hearing"
1951,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her own name called, and in a moment Edward Merton stood by her side."
1952,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1953,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Annie, come, Annie, just don your sun-bonnet, and walk with us to the"
1954,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Island."""
1955,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1956,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Suiting the action to the word, he placed her bonnet upon her head,"
1957,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and drew her willing arm in his, and they soon joined the group of gay"
1958,WITHERED LEAVES.,companions that stood chatting and laughing at the door. Well did the
1959,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sable dress that Annie wore become her fine complexion, for the rose"
1960,WITHERED LEAVES.,"blended with the lily upon her cheek, and beauty sat triumphant upon"
1961,WITHERED LEAVES.,her ruby lips and sparkled in her dark flashing eyes. But recent
1962,WITHERED LEAVES.,"events had cast an expression of melancholy over her countenance,"
1963,WITHERED LEAVES.,which for a moment had a sobering influence over her young companions
1964,WITHERED LEAVES.,when she joined them.
1965,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1966,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Edward and Annie lingered a little behind the rest, talking of their"
1967,WITHERED LEAVES.,"future prospects, and of the coming separation, as Edward was soon to"
1968,WITHERED LEAVES.,"leave for Boston, where a more desirable situation was offered him"
1969,WITHERED LEAVES.,than could be obtained in the village.
1970,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1971,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""My increased income, my dear Annie, will enable me the sooner to"
1972,WITHERED LEAVES.,"claim you for my bride; true, the separation will be painful, but I"
1973,WITHERED LEAVES.,am determined never to marry till I can commence house-keeping
1974,WITHERED LEAVES.,"genteelly."""
1975,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1976,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She looked earnestly in his face and said, ""Edward, it is home where"
1977,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the heart is, and it seems to me we should not spurn a present for a"
1978,WITHERED LEAVES.,"future good. This life is short and uncertain, and I feel a gloomy"
1979,WITHERED LEAVES.,"foreboding when I think of your departure, I have been so accustomed"
1980,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to seeing you every day, to leaning on your arm in every walk, and"
1981,WITHERED LEAVES.,"going so constantly with you everywhere, that I shall miss you sadly"
1982,WITHERED LEAVES.,"when you are away; but,"" she continued, smiling through her tears, ""I"
1983,WITHERED LEAVES.,"suppose I must turn nun"" and live in seclusion during your absence?"""
1984,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1985,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O, do not do that,"" he replied, smiling; ""It will be but for a short"
1986,WITHERED LEAVES.,"time, and it is said, 'absence lends enchantment to the view.'"""
1987,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1988,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O, dear,"" cried Melinda, a blue eyed beauty, leaning confidently upon"
1989,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the arm of Theodore Stanley, ""I should think Ed and Ann were saying"
1990,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their parting adieus, they look so sad."""
1991,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1992,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Upon this the eyes of the whole group were turned upon them, and"
1993,WITHERED LEAVES.,"affecting a gaiety they did not feel, they soon hastened forward and"
1994,WITHERED LEAVES.,joined in the general conversation till they came to the place of
1995,WITHERED LEAVES.,their destination.
1996,WITHERED LEAVES.,
1997,WITHERED LEAVES.,"What was called the Island, was a point of land in the edge of a large"
1998,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pond, or lake it might be called, as it was six miles long and three"
1999,WITHERED LEAVES.,"or four wide. It was separated from the main land in low water, by a"
2000,WITHERED LEAVES.,"small stream that was crossed by a large stone placed in the centre,"
2001,WITHERED LEAVES.,for a stepping stone; but in high water it could be reached only with
2002,WITHERED LEAVES.,boats.
2003,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2004,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The little party crossed this stream, and seated themselves upon the"
2005,WITHERED LEAVES.,"grassy knolls, beneath the giant oaks that spread their huge branches"
2006,WITHERED LEAVES.,"around them, for they were the growth of centuries. Loud came the"
2007,WITHERED LEAVES.,"chorus of the feathered tribe, as they sang their evening hymns before"
2008,WITHERED LEAVES.,"retiring to their nests, which were very abundant in that shady"
2009,WITHERED LEAVES.,"retreat, which afforded them protection from the truant school boys."
2010,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2011,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie reclined against the trunk of one of the largest trees, seated"
2012,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by Edward's side, when suddenly looking up, she said,"
2013,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2014,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O, Edward, let me have your knife."""
2015,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2016,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He reached it to her, and she immediately commenced carving his name"
2017,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in the tough bark of the tree, against which she was leaning."
2018,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2019,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Many followed her example, and many fairy fingers were busy carving"
2020,WITHERED LEAVES.,the names of their favorite friend upon the trunks of the aged trees
2021,WITHERED LEAVES.,that surrounded them.
2022,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2023,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I shall cut it deep,"" said Annie, ""so that it will live forever; and"
2024,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I hope there will be neither mould nor moss upon it, to hide it from"
2025,WITHERED LEAVES.,"view, as I shall love to come and look upon when you are far away."""
2026,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2027,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Ann,"" said one, ""we will come here in the long summer days, and weave"
2028,WITHERED LEAVES.,"chaplets of the bright leaves of the old oak, and twine them round our"
2029,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lord's name."""
2030,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2031,WITHERED LEAVES.,"This occupied their time till the shadows of evening fell around them,"
2032,WITHERED LEAVES.,and it was dark when they reached their homes.
2033,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2034,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was midnight--dark, dreary midnight. Black clouds hung in huge,"
2035,WITHERED LEAVES.,"portentous masses over, the vault of heaven. The forky lightning"
2036,WITHERED LEAVES.,"flashed, and the deep toned thunder reverberated peal on peal, while"
2037,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the shrieking winds rocked the tree tops, and poured their wild melody"
2038,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the ear. It was nature arrayed in awful sublimity, displaying the"
2039,WITHERED LEAVES.,majesty of God.
2040,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2041,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Seated on a low chair, in the simple little parlor of Annie, sat"
2042,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Edward, with a pillow upon his breast, supporting the head of the poor"
2043,WITHERED LEAVES.,"girl, whose breathing was laborious, and her cheeks flushed with an"
2044,WITHERED LEAVES.,"unusual glow, as she leaned against him for support. This was the only"
2045,WITHERED LEAVES.,"situation in which she could breathe, as there was an abscess forming"
2046,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in her throat. Her physician said she must sit bending forward, as"
2047,WITHERED LEAVES.,"there was great danger of its producing strangulation, should it break"
2048,WITHERED LEAVES.,"when she was in any other position, which he thought probably it might"
2049,WITHERED LEAVES.,"do before morning. Edward, therefore, could not think of leaving her;"
2050,WITHERED LEAVES.,"but kept his patient watch by her side during the night, alleviating"
2051,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her sufferings by every means in his power, speaking tender words of"
2052,WITHERED LEAVES.,"constancy and love, and picturing long years of connubial felicity"
2053,WITHERED LEAVES.,after he had won a fortune in the distant city.
2054,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2055,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Suddenly there came a brighter flash, a deeper crash, and it seemed"
2056,WITHERED LEAVES.,for the moment that the house was immersed in a lurid glare of light.
2057,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie, screaming, started to her feet, then fell back, fainting, and"
2058,WITHERED LEAVES.,black in the face with suffocation.
2059,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2060,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Edward thought, as he caught her falling form, that all was over; but"
2061,WITHERED LEAVES.,"after a short struggle she recovered, and the crisis of her disease"
2062,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had past, and she could now breathe easier than she done for several"
2063,WITHERED LEAVES.,days.
2064,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2065,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She had taken cold during their stay on the Island, and had been sick"
2066,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from that time. The storm had spent its fury, and the clouds had"
2067,WITHERED LEAVES.,"passed away, leaving the blue canopy of heaven studded with golden"
2068,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stars, and all nature was refreshed by the rain that had fallen during"
2069,WITHERED LEAVES.,the shower.
2070,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2071,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie dropped into a sweet slumber, the first that had visited her"
2072,WITHERED LEAVES.,"eyes for several nights; and Edward revolved many things in his mind,"
2073,WITHERED LEAVES.,as he held her to his heart. Would she remain constant during his
2074,WITHERED LEAVES.,"absence, and meet him with the same affectionate greeting? What would"
2075,WITHERED LEAVES.,be the changes that would take place in that time? for he felt there
2076,WITHERED LEAVES.,"must be changes. And, last of all, would his feelings be the same"
2077,WITHERED LEAVES.,"towards her? truly, of this there was no doubt--was she not his own"
2078,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sweet Annie, who for three years had been his affianced bride, and,"
2079,WITHERED LEAVES.,"surely, there could be no change in him. But Edward Merton had not"
2080,WITHERED LEAVES.,"then explored all the secret chambers of his own heart, and realized"
2081,WITHERED LEAVES.,"not that it was an unwarranted ambition that, even then, was urging"
2082,WITHERED LEAVES.,"him to leave the object of his affection, postpone his projected"
2083,WITHERED LEAVES.,"marriage, and leave the friends of his youth where competence rewarded"
2084,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his toil, for the purpose of acquiring wealth in a land of strangers."
2085,WITHERED LEAVES.,The golden sun gemmed the drops of the previous night with the
2086,WITHERED LEAVES.,"diamond's lustre, and the voice of active life awoke in the village,"
2087,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ere Annie awoke from her slumber, exclaiming,"
2088,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2089,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Why, Edward, is it possible I have slept so late? but wearied nature"
2090,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was quite exhausted."""
2091,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2092,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""You look finely refreshed,"" said he, giving her the parting kiss;"
2093,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""but I must away to my shop."""
2094,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2095,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie recovered rapidly, and soon the time came for Edward's"
2096,WITHERED LEAVES.,departure.
2097,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2098,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He could only speak of the future, seeming to think little of the past"
2099,WITHERED LEAVES.,or present.
2100,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2101,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I shall write to you often, Annie, and you are mine till death do us"
2102,WITHERED LEAVES.,"part, just as much as though Parson Bates had told us so."""
2103,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2104,WITHERED LEAVES.,A faint smile rested for a moment upon the lip of Annie--then faded
2105,WITHERED LEAVES.,"away, leaving a sadder expression than before. There was a melancholy"
2106,WITHERED LEAVES.,"foreboding at her heart, and she at least did not feel willing to"
2107,WITHERED LEAVES.,sacrifice present happiness for future wealth; and she feared the
2108,WITHERED LEAVES.,ambition of Edward would not be easily satisfied. But she strove to
2109,WITHERED LEAVES.,"subdue the feeling, and when their lips united in the parting kiss,"
2110,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a pang shot though her heart, and ""it is his last kiss,"" passed"
2111,WITHERED LEAVES.,involuntarily through her thoughts.
2112,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2113,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She turned hastily away to wipe the tears from her eyes, and bury her"
2114,WITHERED LEAVES.,grief in her own bosom.
2115,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2116,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Edward, after a prosperous journey, arrived safely at his place of"
2117,WITHERED LEAVES.,"destination, was settled in a lucrative business, even exceeding his"
2118,WITHERED LEAVES.,"most sanguine expectations, and was constant in his promise of writing"
2119,WITHERED LEAVES.,to Annie.
2120,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2121,WITHERED LEAVES.,"When winter returned with his winds, the aged grandfather was stricken"
2122,WITHERED LEAVES.,down by death. He fell like a sturdy oak before the stroke of the
2123,WITHERED LEAVES.,"destroyer, for he too had buffetted many a winter's storm, having"
2124,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lived beyond the age of man. They bore him to his grave, when the"
2125,WITHERED LEAVES.,"winds of winter blew fiercely round, and the drifting snow almost"
2126,WITHERED LEAVES.,obstructed their passage to the grave yard. He was deposited in the
2127,WITHERED LEAVES.,"place alotted him, and left to his repose, with the bleak winds of"
2128,WITHERED LEAVES.,winter pelting fiercely upon his grave. He heeded them not--that weary
2129,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sleeper, tired of looking upon the world, with all its changes."
2130,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2131,WITHERED LEAVES.,Capt. Somers settled in that country before the woodman's axe had
2132,WITHERED LEAVES.,felled the forest trees; and when they must pursue their way to
2133,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Gardiner by spotted trees, and frequently did herds of Indians wrapped"
2134,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in their blankets, call at their door and exchange the moose meat"
2135,WITHERED LEAVES.,"which they had dried, for beef, bread and other eatables."
2136,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2137,WITHERED LEAVES.,"These were times that tried men's souls, for during the war they were"
2138,WITHERED LEAVES.,frequently alarmed by hearing that unfriendly Indians were coming upon
2139,WITHERED LEAVES.,"them, which would fill the early settlers with dismay. So it might"
2140,WITHERED LEAVES.,"well be said, as they laid the aged man to rest, he had seen changes,"
2141,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for truly, had he seen ""the wilderness made to bud and blossom like"
2142,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the rose,"" and the temple of the living God supplying the place of the"
2143,WITHERED LEAVES.,Indian's wigwam.
2144,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2145,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The grandson, who had come in possession of the property, decided to"
2146,WITHERED LEAVES.,"break up house-keeping, and placing his grandmother in the family of"
2147,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a son, soon accomplished his purpose, leaving Annie and Ellen to look"
2148,WITHERED LEAVES.,"out for themselves. Ellen went to reside with her mother, who had"
2149,WITHERED LEAVES.,erected a little cottage in a distant village.
2150,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2151,WITHERED LEAVES.,This was a severe trial to Annie; she scarcely knew what course to
2152,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pursue; but, procuring board with an intimate friend, she entered a"
2153,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cotton factory with a number of her young friends, thinking that would"
2154,WITHERED LEAVES.,"be a respectable, and an easy way of obtaining her livelihood."
2155,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2156,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She wrote an affectionate letter to Edward, informing him of the"
2157,WITHERED LEAVES.,"change in her circumstances and her present occupation, saying she did"
2158,WITHERED LEAVES.,"not think the occupation would diminish her worth, or tarnish her good"
2159,WITHERED LEAVES.,name.
2160,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2161,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He answered it by requesting her to leave her employment, and"
2162,WITHERED LEAVES.,offering to pay her board if she would do so; but she preferred being
2163,WITHERED LEAVES.,"independent, and thought she would remain and earn what she could to"
2164,WITHERED LEAVES.,"help herself; and there the matter dropped, she working on two weary"
2165,WITHERED LEAVES.,"years. Often did she visit the Island, gaze upon the name of Edward,"
2166,WITHERED LEAVES.,and recall the scenes of that and many other evenings.
2167,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2168,WITHERED LEAVES.,Many of the companions of that evening had united their destinies
2169,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for life--many had left the village, and some had closed their eyes"
2170,WITHERED LEAVES.,"forever upon the things of earth, and entered upon the untried scenes"
2171,WITHERED LEAVES.,of eternity.
2172,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2173,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was the close of a dreary autumn day, when the withered leaves"
2174,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rustled before the cold chilly winds, and the dust was hurried on in"
2175,WITHERED LEAVES.,"eddying torrents, that there came a whispered report to the ear of"
2176,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie that Edward had returned from Boston. Her heart beat violently,"
2177,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and she could scarcely stand upon her feet, as she contemplated the"
2178,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pleasure of seeing him again, after so long an absence. Many were the"
2179,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cordial greetings she received from her merry companions, upon the"
2180,WITHERED LEAVES.,"occasion. She hurried home, eager with expectation, wondering, as she"
2181,WITHERED LEAVES.,"judged him by the tumultuous beatings of her own heart, he did not"
2182,WITHERED LEAVES.,"seek her sooner. As she passed on to her boarding place, she saw him"
2183,WITHERED LEAVES.,"standing at a distance, in conversation with his brother, and although"
2184,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his back was towards her, she mentally exclaimed,"
2185,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2186,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""It is indeed my own Edward."""
2187,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2188,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She made her toilet with great care, and dressed herself in such"
2189,WITHERED LEAVES.,"colors as were pleasing to him, arranging her hair in the way that"
2190,WITHERED LEAVES.,he had so often praised. The fire diffused a cheerful glow round the
2191,WITHERED LEAVES.,"comfortable apartment. Annie seated herself by the window, momentarily"
2192,WITHERED LEAVES.,expecting his arrival. She took up a book and tried to read. Hour
2193,WITHERED LEAVES.,"passed after hour, and still she listened in vain for his well known"
2194,WITHERED LEAVES.,footsteps. The clock struck nine; the fire had gone out upon the
2195,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hearth, and the autumnal gale whistled mournfully round and swayed the"
2196,WITHERED LEAVES.,branches of a leafless tree that stood beneath her window.
2197,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2198,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie arose, extinguished her light, and again seated herself by the"
2199,WITHERED LEAVES.,"window, leaning her cheek upon her hand, with her elbow resting upon"
2200,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the window stool, she sat looking back into the silent chambers of the"
2201,WITHERED LEAVES.,past.
2202,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2203,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The wan, declining moon looked coldly down upon her, as it peeped out"
2204,WITHERED LEAVES.,behind
2205,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2206,WITHERED LEAVES.,"--""the broken parted clouds,"
2207,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Brightening their dark brown sides."""
2208,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2209,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She sat, pale and motionless, till the stars faded from the sky, and"
2210,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the golden king of day announced his coming, by streaking the east"
2211,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with his herald beams. She was accosted by her companions, with many"
2212,WITHERED LEAVES.,"compliments upon her looks, as they joked her upon the return of her"
2213,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lover, and concluded by sympathising with her in his early departure"
2214,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for L., the residence of his father. Little thought these careless"
2215,WITHERED LEAVES.,ones how deep a wound they were inflicting upon the heart of the
2216,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sensitive Annie. She never told her grief, but strove to hide her"
2217,WITHERED LEAVES.,"feelings in her own bosom. She could not think he had forsaken her,"
2218,WITHERED LEAVES.,but often would she think it was indeed his last kiss.
2219,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2220,WITHERED LEAVES.,About this time the owners of the factory concluded their profits did
2221,WITHERED LEAVES.,"not amount to what they anticipated, and therefore, dismissed their"
2222,WITHERED LEAVES.,help and shut up their factory.
2223,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2224,WITHERED LEAVES.,The circumstances of Edward and Annie had now become generally known.
2225,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2226,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She said little, only affirming he should have all the honor there was"
2227,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to be had, for she had much rather have the name of being deceived,"
2228,WITHERED LEAVES.,than keeping company with a man so long she did not love; but every
2229,WITHERED LEAVES.,"one, of course, would express their opinion, and so the village talk"
2230,WITHERED LEAVES.,went on.
2231,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2232,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Perhaps it was with less regret upon this account, that Annie prepared"
2233,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to leave the place, to live with an aunt that resided a few miles"
2234,WITHERED LEAVES.,"distant. She collected together her little stock of goods, which she"
2235,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had prepared for house-keeping, consisting of table linen, bedding"
2236,WITHERED LEAVES.,and such like things that the careful housewife knows so well how to
2237,WITHERED LEAVES.,appreciate.
2238,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2239,WITHERED LEAVES.,Among the many and beautiful bed quilts pieced by her industrious
2240,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fingers, was one set together in what is called Job's trouble, with"
2241,WITHERED LEAVES.,"many a grave warning ringing in her ears, accompanied by an ominous"
2242,WITHERED LEAVES.,"shake of the head, and an assurance she never would marry Edward if"
2243,WITHERED LEAVES.,"she pieced her quilt together so. She sighed now as she unfolded it,"
2244,WITHERED LEAVES.,and stood for a moment gazing upon its beauty. Then smoothly replacing
2245,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the folds, and laying it in a large chest, she sighed as she said,"
2246,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2247,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Indeed, I shall never marry him."""
2248,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2249,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Years had passed, and many suitors had sighed for the hand of Annie,"
2250,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and she had consented to become the wife of Alfred Lombard, after"
2251,WITHERED LEAVES.,succeeding years should more fully obliterate the remembrance of
2252,WITHERED LEAVES.,"past disappointment. He was a young man of good family, and handsome"
2253,WITHERED LEAVES.,"exterior, and though Annie did not love him with the ardor of a first"
2254,WITHERED LEAVES.,"love, still she respected his character, and admired his virtues."
2255,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2256,WITHERED LEAVES.,"His estimable mother too, had shown much affection for the fatherless"
2257,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie, and she had spent many months beneath their hospitable roof,"
2258,WITHERED LEAVES.,"supplying to them the place of a daughter, while they conferred upon"
2259,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her all the affection of parents, and looking wishfully forward to the"
2260,WITHERED LEAVES.,time when their marriage should take place.
2261,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2262,WITHERED LEAVES.,Annie was schooling her heart to forget the past; but some remembered
2263,WITHERED LEAVES.,"word, or dearly loved token would awaken the old grief in her bosom,"
2264,WITHERED LEAVES.,and bring the scalding tear drops to her eye lids.
2265,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2266,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was a bright afternoon in early autumn, that Annie sat sewing by"
2267,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a window in the luxuriously furnished parlor of Colonel Stuart, her"
2268,WITHERED LEAVES.,"uncle, who was the practicing physician of the village, that she was"
2269,WITHERED LEAVES.,started by a loud ringing of the door bell. Supposing it was some one
2270,WITHERED LEAVES.,"after her uncle, she paid little heed till she heard her own name"
2271,WITHERED LEAVES.,"called, and in a moment after Edward Merton stood before her. He"
2272,WITHERED LEAVES.,"extended his hand, exclaiming, ""My Annie."" There was a marble paleness"
2273,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon her cheek, and with a trembling voice she saluted him. He said"
2274,WITHERED LEAVES.,as he was returning from Augusta he thought he would take that
2275,WITHERED LEAVES.,"opportunity to return her letters, and take his, at the same time"
2276,WITHERED LEAVES.,drawing a small package from his pocket. She took them with a
2277,WITHERED LEAVES.,"trembling hand, but strove to appear calm, for she saw he was watching"
2278,WITHERED LEAVES.,her with Argus eyes to fathom the secret recesses of her soul.
2279,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2280,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She entered her chamber and took from a small box, which was a gift"
2281,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from Edward, those dear old letters, over which she had wept so often,"
2282,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and which breathed tender tones of love and affection, and spoke of"
2283,WITHERED LEAVES.,happy wedded days in the perspective.
2284,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2285,WITHERED LEAVES.,But now she must part with these too. She pressed them once more to
2286,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her heart, and entering the room, presented them to him. He glanced at"
2287,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her earnestly as he took them from her, saying as he did so,"
2288,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2289,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""You do not look well, Miss Somers."""
2290,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2291,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She colored slightly, and replied,"
2292,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2293,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O yes sir, I am quite well."""
2294,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2295,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I suppose,"" continued he, ""you have heard that I was about being"
2296,WITHERED LEAVES.,"married."""
2297,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2298,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I have,"" was her brief answer."
2299,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2300,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""It is a mistake, I have no idea of it,"" and wishing her a hasty good"
2301,WITHERED LEAVES.,afternoon he took his leave without any reference to or explanation of
2302,WITHERED LEAVES.,past events.
2303,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2304,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie sat like a statue after his departure, crushing the letters in"
2305,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her hands, gazing upon vacancy. A marble paleness overspread her face,"
2306,WITHERED LEAVES.,and she felt now that her cup of misery was indeed full. She laid
2307,WITHERED LEAVES.,"aside her work, and locking herself in her chamber gave vent to her"
2308,WITHERED LEAVES.,feelings in a passionate flood of tears. She tried to conquer her
2309,WITHERED LEAVES.,"feelings and summon her woman's pride to her aid, but it would not"
2310,WITHERED LEAVES.,"do. ""Cruel Edward,"" she mentally exclaimed, ""you might have spared me"
2311,WITHERED LEAVES.,"this, or told me the cause of this neglect and coldness."" And as she"
2312,WITHERED LEAVES.,"reflected upon the trapping of wealth with which he was surrounded,"
2313,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and the splendor of his equipage, she asked herself, ""can it be that"
2314,WITHERED LEAVES.,"love of gold is the cause?"" Echo answered ""can it be?"""
2315,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2316,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As the weary night drew to a close, the tempest in the poor girl's"
2317,WITHERED LEAVES.,bosom began to subside. But as the heaving ocean bears upon its waves
2318,WITHERED LEAVES.,plank after plank of the ship-wrecked vessel that has been stranded
2319,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon its tempest tossed bosom, so did the surging waves of memory"
2320,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bring back one incident after another in her past life, and picture"
2321,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the tender looks and the tender tones of the unfaithful Edward, during"
2322,WITHERED LEAVES.,the many long years she had regarded him as her future husband. To him
2323,WITHERED LEAVES.,she had yielded up her heart's best affections. For his sake she had
2324,WITHERED LEAVES.,rejected many an advantageous offer of marriage.
2325,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2326,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She met the family in the morning with quite a composed countenance,"
2327,WITHERED LEAVES.,but with a sad heart.
2328,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2329,WITHERED LEAVES.,"In the afternoon she went to her uncle's to visit her grandmother,"
2330,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thinking, perhaps, change of place might produce some change in her"
2331,WITHERED LEAVES.,feelings. It was a delightful afternoon. The sun shed that soft
2332,WITHERED LEAVES.,"subdued light so peculiar to the season, over the face of nature,"
2333,WITHERED LEAVES.,which seemed rather approximating to maturity than verging to decay.
2334,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The trees were robed in their deepest green, while the early ripe"
2335,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fruit hung temptingly upon their branches, or lay scattered upon the"
2336,WITHERED LEAVES.,ground beneath. Scarce a breeze agitated the trembling leaf or cooled
2337,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the fever upon her cheek. ""O,"" thought she, as she passed along, ""the"
2338,WITHERED LEAVES.,howling of the wintry storms would better correspond with my feelings
2339,WITHERED LEAVES.,"than this holy calm."" She, in her agony, had not yet learned to bathe"
2340,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her restless spirit in the fountain of Jiving waters, or to listen"
2341,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to that voice that said, ""Peace, be still,"" and the winds and waves"
2342,WITHERED LEAVES.,"obeyed; therefore she had no ""shelter from the windy storm and"
2343,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tempest."""
2344,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2345,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She was startled by hearing some one near her repeating in a low,"
2346,WITHERED LEAVES.,"musical voice,"
2347,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2348,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Little Hannah Pease, little Hannah Pease; old Ben Thornton, old"
2349,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Ben Thornton,"" and looking up, perceived near her a female, loosely"
2350,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wrapped in a large white woolen blanket, which was her only clothing."
2351,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Her head and feet were entirely bare. Her black hair was cut short,"
2352,WITHERED LEAVES.,and her weather beaten countenance retained traces of great beauty.
2353,WITHERED LEAVES.,She stood courtesying and smiling to a rock. As Annie reached her
2354,WITHERED LEAVES.,"side, she muttered, ""Old Ben Thornton, old Ben Thornton, you deceived"
2355,WITHERED LEAVES.,"poor Betsey Lotrop--you deceived poor Betsey Lotrop."""
2356,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2357,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie gazed upon her with pity, saying mentally,"
2358,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2359,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""A poor victim of unfaithful love; I hope the fire that is feeding"
2360,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the springs of my life may never destroy my reason,"" and at that"
2361,WITHERED LEAVES.,"moment she seemed to feel the need of seeking aid from a higher power,"
2362,WITHERED LEAVES.,and for the first time the prayer for guidance and direction went
2363,WITHERED LEAVES.,"up to God, in earnest supplication, and our Father, who pitieth his"
2364,WITHERED LEAVES.,"children and seeth the returning prodigal afar off, breathed peace"
2365,WITHERED LEAVES.,"into her troubled spirit, and thus commenced the first dawnings of a"
2366,WITHERED LEAVES.,new and better life in the heart of this poor lonely one.
2367,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2368,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Poor Betsy stood curtesying and talking to the rock, till Annie walked"
2369,WITHERED LEAVES.,"some distance from her, when gathering her blanket a little more"
2370,WITHERED LEAVES.,"closely about her, and walking rapidly forward, soon overtook her,"
2371,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and looking earnestly in her face, with a low, gurgling laugh, she"
2372,WITHERED LEAVES.,"continued,"
2373,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2374,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Poor little Hannah Pease, poor little Hannah Pease--perhaps, if you"
2375,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had married him, you wouldn't been any better off. This face was a"
2376,WITHERED LEAVES.,beautiful face once; it was the handsomest face that ever was seen;
2377,WITHERED LEAVES.,"look at it now--how would you find it out? Old Ben Thornton, old Ben"
2378,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Thornton,"" and fetching another laugh, she sprang over the fence, and"
2379,WITHERED LEAVES.,was soon lost from sight among the trees.
2380,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2381,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie soon reached her uncle's, where she met with a cordial"
2382,WITHERED LEAVES.,"reception, and she felt that she had learned a salutary lesson from"
2383,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the poor lunatic. The next afternoon, she and her cousin Edith"
2384,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wandered forth into an adjoining field, to enjoy a stroll beneath the"
2385,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cloudless sky, and inhale the sweet breath of autumn, which was borne"
2386,WITHERED LEAVES.,upon the gentle gales. Nature was at rest. No stormy wind ruffled her
2387,WITHERED LEAVES.,bosom or agitated its surface. Her rich store of fruits lay spread
2388,WITHERED LEAVES.,"out in great abundance, and the whitened fields stood ready for the"
2389,WITHERED LEAVES.,harvest.
2390,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2391,WITHERED LEAVES.,They conversed upon indifferent subjects till they came to a little
2392,WITHERED LEAVES.,"silver stream, threading its silent way through the silken grass. They"
2393,WITHERED LEAVES.,crossed and seating themselves beneath the shade of a thrifty apple
2394,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tree, picked up some of the delicious fruit that lay scattered in rich"
2395,WITHERED LEAVES.,profusion around them.
2396,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2397,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O, Annie, I forgot to tell you I received a visit from Dora,"
2398,WITHERED LEAVES.,yesterday; she is very unhappy on account of Charles Stanley's
2399,WITHERED LEAVES.,"conduct. She did not wish to go to the ball, on account of her"
2400,WITHERED LEAVES.,"father's death, and he waited upon Eveline Houghton--then left for"
2401,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Turner without calling to see Dora."""
2402,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2403,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Indeed, I thought they were to be married this fall?"""
2404,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2405,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Such has been the report; but as she has not seen or heard from him"
2406,WITHERED LEAVES.,"since, she does not know how to construe his conduct towards her."""
2407,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2408,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""When Orville was returning from his eastern tour, he came across"
2409,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Charles, in Portland, and rode with him a short distance. He sent Dora"
2410,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a present by him, but told him nothing of the transaction. She came to"
2411,WITHERED LEAVES.,"me in hopes of hearing something more definite from him."""
2412,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2413,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""How does the poor girl bear it?"""
2414,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2415,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""She is very unhappy, and says she is not ashamed to have people know"
2416,WITHERED LEAVES.,she had been deceived; but many tell her they wouldn't mind anything
2417,WITHERED LEAVES.,"about it."""
2418,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2419,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""They may say so,"" said Annie, raising her dark eyes to Edith, while a"
2420,WITHERED LEAVES.,"deeper flush suffused her cheek; ""but, Edith, I tell you, it will wear"
2421,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and wear upon the secret springs of life, till it bears its victim to"
2422,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the grave."""
2423,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2424,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Edith gazed upon her with such an anxious, pitying expression, that"
2425,WITHERED LEAVES.,"she felt she had betrayed her own secret, and bending her head to hide"
2426,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her blushes, she picked up the mellow, golden colored fruit that lay"
2427,WITHERED LEAVES.,"around her, and commenced rolling them down into the stream that"
2428,WITHERED LEAVES.,flowed at their feet. At that moment poor crazy Betsey Thornton came
2429,WITHERED LEAVES.,bounding over the stone wall that separated that from an adjoining
2430,WITHERED LEAVES.,"enclosure, and gathering her blanket about her, stood curtesying and"
2431,WITHERED LEAVES.,"laughing before them, repeating as she did so,"
2432,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2433,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Poor little Hannah Pease, poor little Hannah Pease--old Ben Thornton,"
2434,WITHERED LEAVES.,"old Ben Thornton."""

2436,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Take some apples, Mrs. Thornton,"" said Edith, as she regarded her"
2437,WITHERED LEAVES.,with a sad expression of countenance.
2438,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2439,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She took them, curtesied, and with her low, gurgling laugh, leaped"
2440,WITHERED LEAVES.,"over the wall, and went muttering on to rock or tree, or any other"

2442,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2443,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Edith,"" said Annie, ""what poor Blanche is that, for a poor love sick"
2444,WITHERED LEAVES.,"maiden, I am sure she must be? As she came with her large blanket"
2445,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fluttering over the wall, it reminded me of Sir Walter Scott's poor"
2446,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Blanche, that"
2447,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2448,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Stood hovering o'er the hollow way,"
2449,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And fluttered wide her mantle gray."""
2450,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2451,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Edith smiled as she replied,"
2452,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2453,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""You are right--and yet you are wrong in your surmises; she is not the"

2456,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""But,"" replied Annie, ""a victim to man's inconstancy, at any rate?"""
2457,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2458,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Oh, yes, Annie, that is what all the poets sing."""

2467,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Edith."""
2468,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2469,WITHERED LEAVES.,"This conversation led to a full disclosure of Edward's conduct, and"
2470,WITHERED LEAVES.,Annie unbosomed herself more fully to her cousin than she had ever

2481,WITHERED LEAVES.,"gathering around them, when, with arms entwined round each other, they"
2482,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pursued their way back, conversing upon the disappointments of life,"
2483,WITHERED LEAVES.,and the misery that is produced by inconstancy and faithlessness.
2484,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2485,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Mrs. Thornton,"" continued Edith, ""was a beauty, as you may even now"
2486,WITHERED LEAVES.,"perceive by its traces upon her weather beaten countenance, and"
2487,WITHERED LEAVES.,her position in society was far above Mr. Thornton; but won by his
2488,WITHERED LEAVES.,"addresses, she consented to become his wife. They came to this"
2489,WITHERED LEAVES.,"country, among strangers, to an humble home, where she suffered many"
2490,WITHERED LEAVES.,"privations, which she bore with woman's fortitude. But when her"
2491,WITHERED LEAVES.,"husband became an inebriate, and treated her with moroseness and"
2492,WITHERED LEAVES.,"brutality, reason forsook its throne, and she became a maniac. Hannah"
2493,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Pease was an intimate friend of hers, who seems to be ever in her"
2494,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mind, perhaps because she used her influence to prevent the unhappy"
2495,WITHERED LEAVES.,"union."""
2496,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2497,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O,"" said Annie, ""when I reflect upon the misery that sometimes exists"
2498,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in the married state, I almost feel it is well to be situated as I"
2499,WITHERED LEAVES.,"am now, as to be united, even to Edward. But then, the cruel"
2500,WITHERED LEAVES.,"disappointment rankles deep."""
2501,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2502,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""And how many men,"" said Edith, ""make the indifference, the ill"
2503,WITHERED LEAVES.,"temper, or the untidiness of a wife an excuse for their intemperance,"
2504,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tavern-haunting, and all their neglect of home. But it does seem to me"
2505,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that it devolves as much upon a man, to contribute to home happiness"
2506,WITHERED LEAVES.,as upon a woman. But many men of my acquaintance seem ever to cast a
2507,WITHERED LEAVES.,"shadow upon the sunlight of home, and their wives and children shrink"
2508,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from their presence. Is this the wife's fault?"""
2509,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2510,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I think not. If so, I think the stronger yield very readily to the"
2511,WITHERED LEAVES.,"weaker, and certainly should receive our sympathy."""
2512,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2513,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""But, Annie, how much there is in this little world of ours, that is"
2514,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mysterious and beyond our comprehension, and nothing so much so as"
2515,WITHERED LEAVES.,the want of union in the marriage relation. For there the greatest
2516,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fondness is often turned to the greatest inattention. But, oh, may"
2517,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Heaven save me from such a lot!"""
2518,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2519,WITHERED LEAVES.,"By this time the cousins reached the house, and soon retiring to rest,"
2520,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Edith was wandering in the land of dreams, while Annie lay busied in"
2521,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thought, counting the hours of night, and seeking to look ""beyond the"
2522,WITHERED LEAVES.,"narrow bounds of time, and fix her hopes of happiness on heaven."""
2523,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2524,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The rougher blasts of autumn blew more fiercely round, and the dry"
2525,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and withered leaves fell from the trees, and drifted along before the"
2526,WITHERED LEAVES.,"chilly winds, while the black passing clouds cast a deep shadow over"
2527,WITHERED LEAVES.,the face of decaying nature. Everything bespeaking the return of
2528,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dreary, desolating winter."
2529,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2530,WITHERED LEAVES.,Annie had faded with the leaves of autumn--she had heard of Edward's
2531,WITHERED LEAVES.,union with a young lady of great wealth and beauty soon after his
2532,WITHERED LEAVES.,"visit to her, and she felt grieved, when she reflected upon the"
2533,WITHERED LEAVES.,unmanly manner in which he had conducted towards her. She had
2534,WITHERED LEAVES.,"conversed freely with Alfred, and laying all the circumstances of the"
2535,WITHERED LEAVES.,"case before him, told him she should respect him while she lived, but"
2536,WITHERED LEAVES.,was fully sensible her blighted heart never could know another earthly
2537,WITHERED LEAVES.,love.
2538,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2539,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""And while the lamp of life continues to burn,"" she added, ""I wish"
2540,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to direct my thoughts to Heaven, and prepare for that change that is"
2541,WITHERED LEAVES.,"before me. Death, Alfred, will soon claim me for his bride; he, at"
2542,WITHERED LEAVES.,"least, will not prove recreant to his trust."""
2543,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2544,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Alfred kissed her pale cheek, and looked tenderly upon her, feeling"
2545,WITHERED LEAVES.,that her presages were indeed too true.
2546,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2547,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She was soon removed to the home of her mother, whose heart yearned"
2548,WITHERED LEAVES.,towards her dying child with the affection of a true mother. As
2549,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie's health declined rapidly, and the things of earth became more"
2550,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dim and shadowy, the heavenly became more distinct and glorious."
2551,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2552,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O, Ellen,"" she would say, ""how precious at such a time as this, is"
2553,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the presence of the Saviour, who condescends to minister to us in our"
2554,WITHERED LEAVES.,"necessities. O, Ellen, do seek an interest in his dying love. You will"
2555,WITHERED LEAVES.,"be the only remaining one, soon. Father, Matilda, and Willie have long"
2556,WITHERED LEAVES.,"since passed from earth, and soon--very soon, I must join them in the"
2557,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spirit land. Oh, mother, do try by repentance and faith, to meet us"
2558,WITHERED LEAVES.,"there, so that we may be a united family in heaven, though we have"
2559,WITHERED LEAVES.,"been divided upon earth. As I now stand upon the brink of the grave,"
2560,WITHERED LEAVES.,"looking back upon life, and forward to the future life, I feel like"
2561,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the shipwrecked mariner, who has entered the haven of peace, after the"
2562,WITHERED LEAVES.,"winds and the storms have subsided, and the tumultuous tossings of"
2563,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the waves have ceased. For, oh, this poor heart has been wrung by"
2564,WITHERED LEAVES.,"disappointments, but I see now it was all for the best; my Heavenly"
2565,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Father would have all my heart, and so he, in his infinite wisdom,"
2566,WITHERED LEAVES.,"separated me from my idol, and now my affections, separated from"
2567,WITHERED LEAVES.,"earthly love, are fixed upon him, he is my rock, and my stay. No"
2568,WITHERED LEAVES.,earthly friend could go with me 'through the valley and shadow of
2569,WITHERED LEAVES.,"death,' but Christ can go with me, and open wide the gates of heaven,"
2570,WITHERED LEAVES.,and usher my willing spirit into the presence of the happy throng that
2571,WITHERED LEAVES.,"worship before the throne of God."""
2572,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2573,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was a dreary day in mid-winter. The wind howled in fitful gusts,"
2574,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and the falling snow was piled in huge drifts before it. Annie, pale"
2575,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and laboring for breath, was bolstered up, in bed, for the angel"

2577,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fluttering pulses, and the feeble current of life stood still."
2578,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2579,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O,"" said she, ""the winds, in their wild fury, seem singing praises to"
2580,WITHERED LEAVES.,"God. My heart is so attuned to praise, that all things seem to unite"
2581,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in the universal hymn of thanksgiving to our Saviour and our God. O,"
2582,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Ellen, is there no music in those words, to your young heart? And,"
2583,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mother, does it not come to you, in your declining age, and bid your"
2584,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wearied spirit seek that rest that remains for the people of God?"""
2585,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2586,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She ceased to speak: the breath became shorter and shorter, till it"
2587,WITHERED LEAVES.,"only came with convulsive gasps. She once again opened her weary eyes,"
2588,WITHERED LEAVES.,"looked earnestly upon the face of her mother and her sister, then"
2589,WITHERED LEAVES.,"glancing round the apartment, seemed as though she were bidding a last"
2590,WITHERED LEAVES.,adieu to all it contained--then closing them forever upon earthly
2591,WITHERED LEAVES.,"things, without a struggle or a groan, the spirit of Annie Somers"
2592,WITHERED LEAVES.,passed gently away.
2593,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2594,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The storm continued its violence, and desolate indeed, was the cottage"

2596,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie, reposing in the long deep sleep of death."
2597,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2598,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was Sabbath day--a stormy Sabbath day, when the coffin of Annie was"
2599,WITHERED LEAVES.,borne upon the shoulders of four men to its last resting place.
2600,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2601,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was covered with a neat black velvet pall, at each corner of which"
2602,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hung suspended a heavy black silk tassel, which waved in the wind as"
2603,WITHERED LEAVES.,"it came careering on, in fitful gusts, one blast scattering a shower"
2604,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of snow upon the velvet pall, and the next, sweeping it away, and so"
2605,WITHERED LEAVES.,"they laid her in her grave, amid the howling of the wintry storm; but"
2606,WITHERED LEAVES.,it disturbed not her repose.
2607,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2608,WITHERED LEAVES.,Willie and Matilda sleep upon the banks of the Sandy river. The
2609,WITHERED LEAVES.,"father's grave was made upon the banks of the far off Mississippi, and"
2610,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie rests by the side of the winding Androscoggin; her mother, too,"
2611,WITHERED LEAVES.,is by her side; for she soon followed to the land of shadows.
2612,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2613,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Ellen has entered upon the responsible duties of wife and mother, and"
2614,WITHERED LEAVES.,is acting well her part in the drama of life. Her usually volatile

2616,WITHERED LEAVES.,"over it, and it is her earnest endeavor so to live, as to meet the"
2617,WITHERED LEAVES.,"approbation of God, and her own conscience and train her dear children"

2624,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2625,WITHERED LEAVES.,and Annie died without ever receiving any explanation. Thus we will

2820,WITHERED LEAVES.,To pamper him with hourly food;
2821,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But yet they stand there, side by side,"
2822,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Death and the grave, unsatisfied."
2823,WITHERED LEAVES.,"For should a million hourly die,"
2824,WITHERED LEAVES.,Twould not their appetites supply.
2825,WITHERED LEAVES.,But what seem curses to our eyes
2826,WITHERED LEAVES.,Are nought but blessings in disguise;
2827,WITHERED LEAVES.,And sickness is in mercy given
2828,WITHERED LEAVES.,To wean the soul from earth to heaven;
2829,WITHERED LEAVES.,For were all bright and joyous here.
2830,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Who would think on yon, bright sphere?"
2831,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But pleasure pinioned to this sod,"
2832,WITHERED LEAVES.,Our thoughts would never rise to God.
2833,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And death's the passage to the skies,"
2834,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Through which our ransom'd souls must rise,"
2835,WITHERED LEAVES.,"To yonder blissful, bright abode,"
2836,WITHERED LEAVES.,Where dwells our Father and our God.
2837,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But now, sweet bird, I miss thy tone,"
2838,WITHERED LEAVES.,And feel at least one pleasure gone;
2839,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A prowling cat, foe to thy kind,"
2840,WITHERED LEAVES.,Thus wrought the evil she designed.
2841,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Thy life and songs forever o'er,"
2842,WITHERED LEAVES.,Thou wilt charm my ear no more.
2843,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Thus in life's uncertain day,"
2844,WITHERED LEAVES.,The singing birds oft snatch'd away:
2845,WITHERED LEAVES.,And they who linger long in pain
2846,WITHERED LEAVES.,Suffered to linger and remain.
2847,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But God is just in his decrees,"
2848,WITHERED LEAVES.,And wisely orders things like these.
2849,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2850,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2851,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2852,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2853,WITHERED LEAVES.,The Angel Cousin.
2854,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2855,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2856,WITHERED LEAVES.,Our little Mary was dying. The film had gathered over those deep blue
2857,WITHERED LEAVES.,"orbs, and her emaciated form lay white as polished marble stretched"
2858,WITHERED LEAVES.,"out on her little cradle, around which were gathered sympathizing"
2859,WITHERED LEAVES.,"friends, watching the feeble lamp of life as it burned flickering"
2860,WITHERED LEAVES.,in its socket. The grandmother and aunt had been summoned from an
2861,WITHERED LEAVES.,"adjoining village, where they had gone upon a visit the previous"
2862,WITHERED LEAVES.,"morning; and Emma, a sweet cousin not two years old, stood wondering"
2863,WITHERED LEAVES.,"why little Mary did not smile upon her, as she usually did, for she"
2864,WITHERED LEAVES.,had never looked upon death.
2865,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2866,WITHERED LEAVES.,Mary had ever been a fragile child. But her mother had clung to her
2867,WITHERED LEAVES.,with all the devotion of a mother's love. Anxiously did she watch that
2868,WITHERED LEAVES.,"little pale form, pressing it to her heart, and gazing upon it with"
2869,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fond maternal pride, day by day, and night after night, unmindful of"
2870,WITHERED LEAVES.,"food or sleep, so that she might relieve the suffering of her precious"
2871,WITHERED LEAVES.,babe; and ever would she say it will soon be better. One week
2872,WITHERED LEAVES.,"succeeded another, and still there was no change for the better. But"
2873,WITHERED LEAVES.,"oh, how deep was the fountain of that mother's love, and the feeble"
2874,WITHERED LEAVES.,wailing of that dear infant moved all its secret springs.
2875,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2876,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A physician was consulted, who spoke hopefully, but nothing seemed to"
2877,WITHERED LEAVES.,help her.
2878,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2879,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Through the summer months, the salubrity of the air revived her some,"
2880,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and the mother would wander with her round the garden, placing the"
2881,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sweetest flowers in her hand, or sitting beneath the shade of trees,"
2882,WITHERED LEAVES.,she would listen for hours to the murmur of the summer breeze that
2883,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sighed among the branches, or the humming of the bee as it sipped the"
2884,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sweets from surrounding flowers, delighted that her darling Mary might"
2885,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thus inhale the pure breath of heaven. And when those large, soul lit"
2886,WITHERED LEAVES.,"orbs were closed in sweet slumber, and the little fragile form could"
2887,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rest for a short time, the mother would lift her heart to God in"
2888,WITHERED LEAVES.,gratitude and thanksgiving.
2889,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2890,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Summer passed with its weary watching, and her disease assumed a more"
2891,WITHERED LEAVES.,"deffinite appearance, and the mother felt that Mary must die."
2892,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2893,WITHERED LEAVES.,'Twas early autumn; the mother purchased some flannel and prepared a
2894,WITHERED LEAVES.,"robe for her darling, with a mother's pride, believing that that would"
2895,WITHERED LEAVES.,be beneficial to her. It was late in the evening when the task was
2896,WITHERED LEAVES.,"completed, and a neat white apron was hung upon the nail over it, and"
2897,WITHERED LEAVES.,the impatient mother waited the approach of day that she might place
2898,WITHERED LEAVES.,it upon her little form. O how strongly did the bright red robe
2899,WITHERED LEAVES.,"contrast with the lily whiteness of that lovely babe. The tiny hands,"
2900,WITHERED LEAVES.,"as they peeped from beneath their long sleeves, looked like two white"
2901,WITHERED LEAVES.,lilies intermingled with the thick clustering blossoms of the running
2902,WITHERED LEAVES.,rose. The mother looked upon her with pleasure as she saw her so
2903,WITHERED LEAVES.,"comfortably clad, and hoped the increased warmth would improve her"
2904,WITHERED LEAVES.,"health, but when she bore her to her father, saying, ""here is our"
2905,WITHERED LEAVES.,"doll;"" he turned away his dewy eyes, for he saw that she was fading"
2906,WITHERED LEAVES.,away from earth.
2907,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2908,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O Albert,"" said Carrie, ""does she not look now as though she might"
2909,WITHERED LEAVES.,"live?"""
2910,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2911,WITHERED LEAVES.,He could not bear to crush the last hope in the heart of his young
2912,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wife, and remained silent."
2913,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2914,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She continued,"
2915,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2916,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""No one gives me any encouragement, but I do feel more hopeful about"
2917,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her this morning, for she rested better through the night than she has"
2918,WITHERED LEAVES.,"done for several nights."""
2919,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2920,WITHERED LEAVES.,"While she was yet speaking, a piercing shriek broke from the lips of"
2921,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the child, every feature expressed extreme agony, and the last ray of"
2922,WITHERED LEAVES.,hope in the heart of that young mother went out forever.
2923,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2924,WITHERED LEAVES.,"From that time, her precious one failed fast. Vomiting succeeded, and"
2925,WITHERED LEAVES.,the little fountain of strength was ebbing fast away. Little did
2926,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the poor mother think, when she arrayed her little infant in her"
2927,WITHERED LEAVES.,"comfortable flannel robe, it would be the last time she would be"
2928,WITHERED LEAVES.,dressed till she was wrapped in her shroud for the silent grave.
2929,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2930,WITHERED LEAVES.,"During the night her feeble frame was attacked by severe spasms, and"
2931,WITHERED LEAVES.,shriek after shriek filled the heart of the mother with unutterable
2932,WITHERED LEAVES.,"anguish. When that subsided she lay cold and pulseless, with the damp"
2933,WITHERED LEAVES.,dews of death upon her marble forehead. Little hope was entertained of
2934,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her surviving till morning. But the grim messenger delayed his work,"
2935,WITHERED LEAVES.,and morning again awoke all nature to life and beauty.
2936,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2937,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was a cool day, and the running rose bush that clambered over the"
2938,WITHERED LEAVES.,"door, was laden with withered flowers that had lived their little day"
2939,WITHERED LEAVES.,and faded before the early autumn winds. Many a hardier flower was
2940,WITHERED LEAVES.,"blooming brightly, and lifting their heads seemingly in proud defiance"
2941,WITHERED LEAVES.,of the chilling winds that were blowing round them. One little bud
2942,WITHERED LEAVES.,"enveloped in its casing of green that hung waving over the door, was"
2943,WITHERED LEAVES.,"perishing in its beauty, even like the little cradled innocent, that"
2944,WITHERED LEAVES.,even then was passing away before the icy breath of the dark plumed
2945,WITHERED LEAVES.,angel. A hasty despatch was sent for the maternal grandmother and
2946,WITHERED LEAVES.,"aunt, and the grandmother upon the father's side was present, and"
2947,WITHERED LEAVES.,together we watched the failing breath of the dying child. Six brief
2948,WITHERED LEAVES.,"months only had she lingered upon earth, and now she was to depart"
2949,WITHERED LEAVES.,"forever. Many, as they sat in that chamber of death, felt how"
2950,WITHERED LEAVES.,mysterious are the Providences of God. The dried and the withered
2951,WITHERED LEAVES.,"leaf, the full blown flower, and the opening bud were there, and all"
2952,WITHERED LEAVES.,"were spared, while the youngest one of the group was passing away and"
2953,WITHERED LEAVES.,"teaching the one great lesson, ""All flesh is grass, and the goodliness"
2954,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thereof as the flower of the field."""
2955,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2956,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Little Emma stood gazing upon her with an expression of wonder, and"
2957,WITHERED LEAVES.,"when told little Mary would soon be an angel, she raised her blue eyes"
2958,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and smilingly said, ""O Emma will have an angel cousin;"" thus teaching"
2959,WITHERED LEAVES.,a lesson of faith and trust.
2960,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2961,WITHERED LEAVES.,"When the shadows of evening gathered around us, the doctor came in"
2962,WITHERED LEAVES.,and was surprised to find her still living. As she had not swallowed
2963,WITHERED LEAVES.,"during the day, he was surprised upon applying a sponge wet in water"
2964,WITHERED LEAVES.,to her lips to find that she swallowed rather eagerly and without any
2965,WITHERED LEAVES.,difficulty until she had taken several drops. He told the mother she
2966,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had better prepare some warm milk and water, and drop a little of it"
2967,WITHERED LEAVES.,into her mouth as long as she continued to swallow. Hope sprung up
2968,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in her heart, perhaps she might yet live, and quick as lightning the"
2969,WITHERED LEAVES.,recollection of many children who had been snatched from the very jaws
2970,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of death, passed through her memory. But while she was making the"
2971,WITHERED LEAVES.,"preparation, the little bosom heaved one gentle sigh, and we felt that"
2972,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mary was an angel. One glance, one wild scream, and the mother fell"
2973,WITHERED LEAVES.,almost fainting into the arms of her husband.
2974,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2975,WITHERED LEAVES.,The crimson robe that was placed upon her with so many hopes by the
2976,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fond hands of a mother, was removed by other hands, and the little"
2977,WITHERED LEAVES.,body was prepared for the tomb. The mother gazed upon her with tearful
2978,WITHERED LEAVES.,eyes and an aching heart.
2979,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2980,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was a mild, peaceful Sabbath day when they bore her to the tomb."
2981,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The mother placed a robe of white flannel upon her, imprinting as she"
2982,WITHERED LEAVES.,"did so, many kisses on the lily arms she had kissed so many times in"
2983,WITHERED LEAVES.,"all their warmth of living loveliness, when, with a smile upon her"
2984,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lips, and gladness in her eye, she raised them to her mother's lips to"
2985,WITHERED LEAVES.,receive the proffered tokens of affection.
2986,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2987,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And so they placed her in her coffin, with a tiny rosebud in either"
2988,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hand (for she would ever hold flowers longer than any thing else), to"
2989,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wither in their beauty with her, the pale perishing one. And the holy"
2990,WITHERED LEAVES.,"man read from the word of God the impressive lesson, ""Behold thou hast"
2991,WITHERED LEAVES.,"made my days as a hand's breadth, and my age is as nothing before"
2992,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thee;"" and offered up fervent prayer in behalf of the afflicted"
2993,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mourners, and little Mary was borne to the silent tomb."
2994,WITHERED LEAVES.,
2995,WITHERED LEAVES.,"O, who that listened to that gentle autumn breeze that so softly"
2996,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sighed among the trees, and fanned the flower that bent slightly"
2997,WITHERED LEAVES.,"before it, but must feel that there is a God that orders the winds and"
2998,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the sea, and rules over the destinies of men."
2999,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3000,WITHERED LEAVES.,Sad were the hearts of the stricken parents as they returned to their
3001,WITHERED LEAVES.,"little cottage, where everything reminded them of their dear lost"
3002,WITHERED LEAVES.,child.
3003,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3004,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Emma stood beside the vacant cradle, and asked many questions about"
3005,WITHERED LEAVES.,the departed cousin.
3006,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3007,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Why did they take her from her cradle and put her in that little"
3008,WITHERED LEAVES.,"box?"" But was ever comforted by calling her her angel cousin."
3009,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3010,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But time passed on, and other changes came. They left their cottage"
3011,WITHERED LEAVES.,home where this great grief had rested upon them. Another darling
3012,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mary was given them, and found a warm place in their affections. The"
3013,WITHERED LEAVES.,"husband soon left his wife and child, and sought to build up his"
3014,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fortune in a distant land, while the wife and mother dedicates her"
3015,WITHERED LEAVES.,time to the care of the dearly loved treasure her heavenly Father has
3016,WITHERED LEAVES.,committed to her trust.
3017,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3018,WITHERED LEAVES.,"One brief year sped rapidly away, and winter again returned with his"
3019,WITHERED LEAVES.,"winds. It was a wild night, the wintry winds howled fiercely round"
3020,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the dwelling, and pelted the snow and sleet furiously against the"
3021,WITHERED LEAVES.,"casement, when Mrs. Barlow, after attending to those duties that make"
3022,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a New England home so comfortable, dropped her crimson curtains, and"
3023,WITHERED LEAVES.,"seating herself by a comfortable coal fire, commenced preparing her"
3024,WITHERED LEAVES.,little Emma for bed.
3025,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3026,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Oh,"" said she, ""how the wind blows, mamma; what do poor little"
3027,WITHERED LEAVES.,"children do that have no home?"""
3028,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3029,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Said her mother, ""God tempers the wind, my dear, to the shorn lamb."""
3030,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3031,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Mamma, do you know I am going to have a party and go to heaven and"
3032,WITHERED LEAVES.,"invite my angel cousin?"""
3033,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3034,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Are you, indeed."""
3035,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3036,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""But mamma, it is time to say our Father now,"" and the happy mother"
3037,WITHERED LEAVES.,listened to her dear child as she clasped her hands and lisped the
3038,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Lord's prayer, and the appropriate ""now I lay me,"" after which she"
3039,WITHERED LEAVES.,soon dropped into a peaceful slumber.
3040,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3041,WITHERED LEAVES.,Thus evening was spent after evening with the mother and her dear
3042,WITHERED LEAVES.,"child, happy in each other's love."
3043,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3044,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Winter passed, and genial spring came forth in infantile beauty,"
3045,WITHERED LEAVES.,"unbending the streamlets from their icy fetters, and swelling the buds"
3046,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the trees, thus making her early preparation for future beauty"
3047,WITHERED LEAVES.,and usefulness.
3048,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3049,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Emma awoke early one Sabbath morning, and leaving her little crib,"
3050,WITHERED LEAVES.,"nestled down beside her mother. After laying quiet some time, she"
3051,WITHERED LEAVES.,"asked suddenly,"
3052,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3053,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Is it Sunday, mamma?"""
3054,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3055,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Being answered in the affirmative, she said,"
3056,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3057,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""It would be a beautiful day to die. Less die to-day, papa, mamma, and"
3058,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Emma, and go to heaven, and get our golden harps; you have a great"
3059,WITHERED LEAVES.,"one, you and papa, and Emma will have a little one like my little"
3060,WITHERED LEAVES.,"angel cousin."""
3061,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3062,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A shade of sadness passed over the mother's face, but rested not upon"
3063,WITHERED LEAVES.,"it. The form of her darling child was in her arms, her downy cheek"
3064,WITHERED LEAVES.,"resting against her own, and the bright blue eyes gazing earnestly"
3065,WITHERED LEAVES.,into hers with a volume of meaning in their azure depths.
3066,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3067,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""But you must get up now, for it is a beautiful Sabbath day, and we"
3068,WITHERED LEAVES.,"shall go to meeting to-day, and the minister will pray for us to God."
3069,WITHERED LEAVES.,"O how glad I am,"" and the dear child clapped her dimpled hands with"
3070,WITHERED LEAVES.,delight.
3071,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3072,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And so they went to church Sabbath after Sabbath, while Emma ever"
3073,WITHERED LEAVES.,"seemed to enjoy the services, often making observations upon what"
3074,WITHERED LEAVES.,she heard. She inquired every day if it were Sunday; and Saturday
3075,WITHERED LEAVES.,"evenings her play things were all carefully laid aside, and she"
3076,WITHERED LEAVES.,expressed great sympathy for poor little children that played upon
3077,WITHERED LEAVES.,that day.
3078,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3079,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The story of the cross would affect her to tears, and yet she loved"
3080,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to dwell upon it, and it was with great effort her attention could be"
3081,WITHERED LEAVES.,withdrawn from it.
3082,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3083,WITHERED LEAVES.,"One rosy twilight hour, when the departed beams of the sun still"
3084,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lingered, tinging the curtains of the west with those bright and"
3085,WITHERED LEAVES.,gorgeous hues that so frequently surround him at his setting. Emma and
3086,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her mother sat down to spend that happy hour together, and gaze upon"
3087,WITHERED LEAVES.,the scene.
3088,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3089,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Spring was rapidly advancing, and the face of nature was lovely to the"
3090,WITHERED LEAVES.,"eye. The half open buds upon the trees shed sweet perfume, and birds"
3091,WITHERED LEAVES.,carolled their evening songs on every spray.
3092,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3093,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But the things of earth, beautiful though they were, could not satisfy"
3094,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the mind of the child, and when the golden stars spangled the blue"
3095,WITHERED LEAVES.,"canopy above, she talked of golden harps, of her angel cousin, and the"
3096,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mysteries of that unseen world,"
3097,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3098,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Beyond planets, suns, and adamantine spheres."""
3099,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3100,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Suddenly assuming a more thoughtful expression, she said,"
3101,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3102,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O mamma, what would you do if Emma should die? You would have to"
3103,WITHERED LEAVES.,"carry away my crib and little chair, and put all my play things away,"
3104,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and you would have no little Emma. O mamma, how lonesome you would"
3105,WITHERED LEAVES.,"be;"" and bursting into a convulsive fit of sobbing she flung her arms"
3106,WITHERED LEAVES.,"around her mother's neck and wept upon her bosom. Tears too, dimmed"
3107,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the mother's eyes as she pressed her fondly to her heart, and kissed"
3108,WITHERED LEAVES.,"away her tears, while a painful thought went through her heart, ""can"
3109,WITHERED LEAVES.,"it be her conversation is prophetic?"""
3110,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3111,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She soothed her troubled spirit, spoke of the joys of heaven, and"
3112,WITHERED LEAVES.,"after listening to her childish prayer, laid her in her little crib"
3113,WITHERED LEAVES.,with a sweet good night murmured in her ear. Returning to her sitting
3114,WITHERED LEAVES.,"room, long and sadly she reflected upon the words of her darling"
3115,WITHERED LEAVES.,"child, and tried to fathom their import, and earnestly did she pray"
3116,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that night, ""Our Father, prepare me for whatsoever thou art preparing"
3117,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for me, and enable me ever to say, 'thy will be done;'"" and she"
3118,WITHERED LEAVES.,"retired to rest with a subdued spirit, feeling an indefinable"
3119,WITHERED LEAVES.,presentiment of coming sorrow.
3120,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3121,WITHERED LEAVES.,The glad light of morning in a measure dissipated the shadows of the
3122,WITHERED LEAVES.,"previous evening, and the mother and daughter met with a pleasant"
3123,WITHERED LEAVES.,"greeting,--the little girl busied about her play, while her mother"
3124,WITHERED LEAVES.,attended to her domestic duties. They frequently interchanged cheerful
3125,WITHERED LEAVES.,"words. Emma would sometimes personate a house-maid, and assist her"
3126,WITHERED LEAVES.,mother in dusting and arranging the furniture. But suddenly dropping
3127,WITHERED LEAVES.,"all, she stood by her side, and looking earnestly up into her face,"
3128,WITHERED LEAVES.,"said,"
3129,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3130,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O mamma, you may have all my clothes next summer."""
3131,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3132,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Why, Emma,"" replied her mother, ""you will want them yourself."""
3133,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3134,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O no, mamma, I shall not want them; you may have my little brella,"
3135,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and all."""
3136,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3137,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The mother's cheek blanched, and a fearful pang again shot through her"
3138,WITHERED LEAVES.,heart.
3139,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3140,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O Emma, don't talk so, you will wear them all yourself."""
3141,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3142,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O no, mamma, you may have them;"" and seating herself in her little"
3143,WITHERED LEAVES.,"chair, she sat long, looking thoughtful and serious."
3144,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3145,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was morning, bright beautiful morning. The swelling buds had burst"
3146,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their confines, and the apple, pear, peach, cherry, and plum trees"
3147,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that surrounded the house, were thickly covered with sweet scented,"
3148,WITHERED LEAVES.,"many colored blossoms, that gave promise of a rich harvest of"
3149,WITHERED LEAVES.,delicious fruit. The birds warbled their matin songs in sweet melody;
3150,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the honey bees with drowsy hum, were sipping sweets to horde their"
3151,WITHERED LEAVES.,winter's store; and every thing seemed rejoicing in the light of that
3152,WITHERED LEAVES.,"glad morning. Even Crib, the great house dog, lay sunning himself on"
3153,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the door step with a satisfied look, snapping at the flies that buzzed"
3154,WITHERED LEAVES.,around him.
3155,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3156,WITHERED LEAVES.,But Emma could not arise to look out upon the joyful face of nature.
3157,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She lay pale and languid upon the bed, telling her mother she was too"
3158,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sick to get up, that she could stay alone while she ironed her clothes"
3159,WITHERED LEAVES.,which she had starched the night before: but wished her to shut the
3160,WITHERED LEAVES.,door to keep out the light and noise.
3161,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3162,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The mother pursued her task with a sad heart, but often would she"
3163,WITHERED LEAVES.,"unclose the door and look in upon the pale child, and show her some"
3164,WITHERED LEAVES.,article of dress she had been preparing for her. She would look up
3165,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with a smile and say,"
3166,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3167,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O good mamma, how nice they look;"" then closing her eyes drop into a"
3168,WITHERED LEAVES.,"deep, heavy sleep."
3169,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3170,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She grew rapidly worse, and the doctor who was called to visit her,"
3171,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pronounced it scarlet fever, that fearful malady among children, but"
3172,WITHERED LEAVES.,thought her symptoms favorable.
3173,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3174,WITHERED LEAVES.,Every attention was bestowed upon her that affection could give; but
3175,WITHERED LEAVES.,the disease rapidly increased.
3176,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3177,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The fire of a terrible fever was raging in her veins, and drying up"
3178,WITHERED LEAVES.,the fountain of her young life. In the wildness of delirium she would
3179,WITHERED LEAVES.,"start suddenly from the arms of her mother, and pierce her heart by"
3180,WITHERED LEAVES.,begging to be carried to her own dear mother.
3181,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3182,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The fifth day of her disease it assumed a more alarming appearance,"
3183,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her extremities becoming cold, and a deathlike palor overspreading her"
3184,WITHERED LEAVES.,"countenance, accompanied by a stupid, dozing state. While laying thus,"
3185,WITHERED LEAVES.,"she started up, exclaiming,"
3186,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3187,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Mamma, if I die, shall I go heaven?"""
3188,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3189,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O, yes, my dear,"" said her mother."
3190,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3191,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Papa said. I should."""
3192,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3193,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then falling into a deep stupor, she noticed nothing for about two"
3194,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hours, when looking up bright and wishfully, turning her body towards"
3195,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her mother, she said, earnestly,"
3196,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3197,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Pray."""
3198,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3199,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Her mother commenced the sweet prayer, so familiar to her,"
3200,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3201,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Now, I lay me."""
3202,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3203,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She joined her trembling voice with hers, and lisped again the words"
3204,WITHERED LEAVES.,"she had loved so well. She appeared exhausted with the effort,"
3205,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and turning away her little head, and closing her weary eyes, lay"
3206,WITHERED LEAVES.,"apparently asleep about five minutes, when arousing herself, with a"
3207,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sweet expression of countenance, she gently murmured,"
3208,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3209,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Amen."""
3210,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3211,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O,"" said the mother, ""perhaps that is Emma's last prayer."""
3212,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3213,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""It may be,"" said the grandmother; ""and how vividly we should remember"
3214,WITHERED LEAVES.,"it, if it should be."""
3215,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3216,WITHERED LEAVES.,Even so--that was the last note of praise that fell from those infant
3217,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lips upon earth. But often does it start upon memory's ear, during the"
3218,WITHERED LEAVES.,"silence of the midnight hour, and seem like gentle whisperings from"
3219,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the spirit land, and bring back recollections at once painful and"
3220,WITHERED LEAVES.,pleasant to the soul.
3221,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3222,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She slept till the twilight hour, when she wished her mother to carry"
3223,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her to the window. Oh, happily were those hours usually spent, when"
3224,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the duties of the day had all been performed, and the quiet shades of"
3225,WITHERED LEAVES.,evening gathered round their dwelling. Often was their talk of heaven.
3226,WITHERED LEAVES.,"O, they were happy hours! but they flew by upon golden wings, leaving"
3227,WITHERED LEAVES.,their deep impress on that fond mother's heart.
3228,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3229,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As she sat with her that evening, looking upon the varied prospect"
3230,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that was spread out before them, no word passed her lips. Her mother"
3231,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pointed to the green grass, the trees covered with clustering"
3232,WITHERED LEAVES.,"blossoms, the river, hurrying on to join old Ocean, reflecting the"
3233,WITHERED LEAVES.,mild radiance of the setting sun on its placid surface; and to the
3234,WITHERED LEAVES.,"busy hum of life, as people hurried to and fro in the village that lay"
3235,WITHERED LEAVES.,distinctly spread out before them; but nothing could elicit a word
3236,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from her, till turning her head wearily, and closing her eyes for the"
3237,WITHERED LEAVES.,"last time upon the beautiful world, with its deep blue sky, and its"
3238,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rich sunset dyes, she said,"
3239,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3240,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O, mamma, lay me in my little bed;"" and after noticing apparently"
3241,WITHERED LEAVES.,"every object in the room, she closed her eyes and lay in a deep stupor"
3242,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for four successive days and nights. Her face was pale as marble, and"
3243,WITHERED LEAVES.,"incoherent words escaped her lips. Sometimes she would murmur,"
3244,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3245,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Oh, carry me home--carry me home."" When she revived from the stupor,"
3246,WITHERED LEAVES.,at times it was agonizing to witness her suffering. But no word
3247,WITHERED LEAVES.,escaped her lips.
3248,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3249,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Everything that medical aid could do was done, and every attention"
3250,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was paid to the suffering child by her parents and friends, and every"
3251,WITHERED LEAVES.,"effort used to stay the disease. But ""he who seeth not as man seeth,"""
3252,WITHERED LEAVES.,"willed it otherwise, and all proved unavailing. On the fifteenth day"
3253,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the rash came on again; the throat swelled badly, and the sufferings"
3254,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the dear little one were extreme. Even then, it was evident she"
3255,WITHERED LEAVES.,"knew her friends, and many were the tokens of affection bestowed"
3256,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon them as they watched beside her couch, and ministered to her"
3257,WITHERED LEAVES.,necessities.
3258,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3259,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Often would she reach up her little emaciated hands, and placing them"
3260,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon her mother's cheeks, press them tenderly. It seemed to soothe"
3261,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her, when her mother would lay her head upon her pillow beside her,"
3262,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and take her little wasted hand in hers. And when she sang to her, in"
3263,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a low, trembling voice, her little favorite hymn,"
3264,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3265,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""There is a happy land, far; far away,"""
3266,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3267,WITHERED LEAVES.,"she lay quiet, and seemed listening with much attention, raising one"
3268,WITHERED LEAVES.,"little hand three times, then laying it fondly round her mother's"
3269,WITHERED LEAVES.,"neck. Long, during that day, did the grief-stricken mother breathe"
3270,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sad, melancholy music into the ears of her dying child."
3271,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3272,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Towards evening that restless state, so common in cholera infantum,"
3273,WITHERED LEAVES.,"came on, accompanied at every breath by a groan, which the doctor said"
3274,WITHERED LEAVES.,must soon wear her out.
3275,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3276,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He gave her an opiate, hoping to relieve the distress."
3277,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3278,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Towards midnight she dropped into a little slumber, and the mother,"
3279,WITHERED LEAVES.,"weary with watching, retired, leaving the father and a sister, to take"
3280,WITHERED LEAVES.,care of her.
3281,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3282,WITHERED LEAVES.,It was Sabbath morning; the gray dawn was just streaking the east with
3283,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the earliest beams of day, when the father, who sat a little distance"
3284,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from his child, thought he saw her gasp for breath. He sprang to her"
3285,WITHERED LEAVES.,"side, and saw too truly, that that pale visitant from the spirit land,"
3286,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that comes to us but once, was dealing with his child. The mother and"
3287,WITHERED LEAVES.,"grandmother, who had watched over her so unweariedly, soon reached the"
3288,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bed; but the brittle thread of life was snapped, and the pure spirit"
3289,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had passed away, with the pale messenger, to the spirit land. There"
3290,WITHERED LEAVES.,were no loud lamentations. The mother pressed her cheeks between her
3291,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hands, exclaiming,"
3292,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3293,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Oh, Emma."""
3294,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3295,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then taking her little pulseless hand in her own, seated herself"
3296,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beside her on the bed, calm and tearless."
3297,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3298,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The father, with his face buried in his hands, sat motionless; but no"
3299,WITHERED LEAVES.,"murmur escaped his lips. He had learned submission to the divine will,"
3300,WITHERED LEAVES.,and was comforted in his hour of need.
3301,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3302,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And brighter, and brighter grew the beams of that holy Sabbath day."
3303,WITHERED LEAVES.,That day the dear child had loved so well. She had loved to enter the
3304,WITHERED LEAVES.,"earthly temple, and join in the hymns of thanksgiving and praise that"
3305,WITHERED LEAVES.,"arose, like sweet incense, upon their sacred altars. And now, with the"
3306,WITHERED LEAVES.,"early dawning of that sacred day, she had passed forever from earth,"
3307,WITHERED LEAVES.,to join the pure throng of worshippers before the throne of God. The
3308,WITHERED LEAVES.,"smile of heaven was upon her face, as though the light of the happy"
3309,WITHERED LEAVES.,spirit still irradiated it.
3310,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3311,WITHERED LEAVES.,Loving hands placed her gently in the shroud and prepared her for the
3312,WITHERED LEAVES.,tomb.
3313,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3314,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As that quiet twilight hour came on, who can picture the agony of the"
3315,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bereaved mother's heart? She stole softly into the chamber of death,"
3316,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and taking the little cold waxen hand in hers, bent fondly over, and"
3317,WITHERED LEAVES.,kissed the marble forehead. It was their favorite hour--the one they
3318,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ever spent together, and those blue eyes were ever then fixed upon"
3319,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her, as she read the word of God, repeated infantile hymns, or"
3320,WITHERED LEAVES.,murmured the evening prayer. But now those dear eyes were forever shut
3321,WITHERED LEAVES.,"on earth, but open to the more exalted beauties of heaven."
3322,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3323,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As she recalled the past, in that solemn place, she weighed well her"
3324,WITHERED LEAVES.,"conduct towards her child, and asked herself if there had been aught"
3325,WITHERED LEAVES.,to tarnish the purity of that spirit that had just entered the portals
3326,WITHERED LEAVES.,of heaven; and earnestly did she beseech her Heavenly Father to
3327,WITHERED LEAVES.,"forgive all that was amiss, and cleanse her from all sin, that she"
3328,WITHERED LEAVES.,might be prepared for a reunion in a better world.
3329,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3330,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was autumn, when little Mary was placed in the tomb, and all things"
3331,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spoke of death and decay. It was now the last days of spring, when the"
3332,WITHERED LEAVES.,"trees had put on their robes of deeper green, and all nature spoke of"
3333,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a resurrection from the dead, when her little coffin was taken from"
3334,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the tomb and placed in the hearse, to be buried in the same grave with"
3335,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her cousin Emma. Emma lay beautiful in death, looking almost like a"
3336,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thing of life, with a smile still lingering upon her lips, while fresh"
3337,WITHERED LEAVES.,"half-blown flowers were placed in her icy fingers, and strewed around"
3338,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the coffin, soon to wither and fade, with that frail child of clay."
3339,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mary had decayed with the pure buds she held in her hands, and ""dust"
3340,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thou art and unto dust thou must return,"" was legibly written on both."
3341,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3342,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The same mourning circle convened, and bore their loved ones to the"
3343,WITHERED LEAVES.,"place of graves. The sisters stood side by side, as the coffins were"
3344,WITHERED LEAVES.,"let down into the earth, and mingled their tears together. It was a"
3345,WITHERED LEAVES.,"melancholy sight, and spoke loudly of the uncertainty of human life."
3346,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3347,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The man of hoary hairs stood over the graves of the tender infant, and"
3348,WITHERED LEAVES.,"felt sensibly, that while the ""young may die, the old must die."""
3349,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3350,WITHERED LEAVES.,The parents cast a long lingering look into the greedy grave that was
3351,WITHERED LEAVES.,"forever to hide their treasure from their sight, then turned sadly"
3352,WITHERED LEAVES.,"away to walk again the pathway of human life, and receive the portion"
3353,WITHERED LEAVES.,their heavenly Father may see fit to meet out to them.
3354,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3355,WITHERED LEAVES.,Sweet is their place of rest. A weeping willow droops over their
3356,WITHERED LEAVES.,"grave, and the flowers of summer shed their perfume and scatter their"
3357,WITHERED LEAVES.,"leaves around. Night winds sigh a mournful requiem, and gentle zephyrs"
3358,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fan the leaves of the weeping willow, and murmur among its branches.."
3359,WITHERED LEAVES.,Two white marble slabs stand at the head of the little heaped up
3360,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mound, and point to the traveller's eye the place where rest the"

3504,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Hannah, it will not do,"" said Captain Currier to his eldest daughter,"
3505,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a neat, quiet looking girl about eighteen, who sat sewing by a window."
3506,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I say Hannah,"" continued he sternly, as her eyes met his, ""it will"
3507,WITHERED LEAVES.,never do for you to throw yourself away upon that miserable scapegrace
3508,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that has visited you so often of late."""
3509,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3510,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The blood mounted in torrents to her cheeks as she replied,"
3511,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3512,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Why, father, you surely cannot mean William Lawrence?"""
3513,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3514,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""And who else should I mean? He is not worth a single iota, and what"
3515,WITHERED LEAVES.,"is more, he is never like to be."""
3516,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3517,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""True, he is not rich, but he is industrious, and with his excellent"
3518,WITHERED LEAVES.,"habits I have no fears on that account."""
3519,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3520,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Oh, you have not, have you,"" said her father, almost fiercely, ""but I"
3521,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tell you Miss, it will never do, so you may think the matter over"
3522,WITHERED LEAVES.,"at your leisure, and settle the affair, I hope, without any farther"
3523,WITHERED LEAVES.,"interference on my part."""
3524,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3525,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She raised her eyes timidly to her father's and said,"
3526,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3527,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I think, sir, you will be obliged to finish the work if it is ever"
3528,WITHERED LEAVES.,"done; my faith is plighted to William, and you know, father, I cannot"
3529,WITHERED LEAVES.,"break my word."""
3530,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3531,WITHERED LEAVES.,"This candid avowal but added ""fuel to the flame"" of the enraged"
3532,WITHERED LEAVES.,"father, and he sternly said,"
3533,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3534,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""My commands are upon you, and I expect you to obey me."""
3535,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3536,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""But father,"" began the trembling girl,"
3537,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3538,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""There is no but in the case. But I will leave you now, for I see your"
3539,WITHERED LEAVES.,"milk and water looking gentleman is coming, and I expect, Hannah, it"
3540,WITHERED LEAVES.,"will be the last time his shadow will ever darken my doors."""
3541,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3542,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As he passed out at one door the young man entered at the opposite,"
3543,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and fixed his handsome eyes, with a searching glance, upon Hannah, as"
3544,WITHERED LEAVES.,"he gave her his cordial greeting, saying,"
3545,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3546,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Are you ill?"""
3547,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3548,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O no, William, I am not ill, but let us walk out into the garden;"
3549,WITHERED LEAVES.,"perhaps the cool winds of heaven will cool the fever upon my brow."""
3550,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3551,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And so they wandered forth among the flowers, to breathe the air that"
3552,WITHERED LEAVES.,comes alike to the children of affluence and pinching want. They
3553,WITHERED LEAVES.,"reached a seat where they had spent many happy hours, over which"
3554,WITHERED LEAVES.,"climbing honeysuckles shed their perfume, and many bright flowers"
3555,WITHERED LEAVES.,"danced in the wind, or drank the pure dews of night as the pitying"
3556,WITHERED LEAVES.,"angel wept upon their bosoms. Hannah was upon her accustomed seat, and"
3557,WITHERED LEAVES.,the eyes of her lover were fixed upon her with that fond expression
3558,WITHERED LEAVES.,"she so well understood, and which found a ready response in her"
3559,WITHERED LEAVES.,youthful heart. Now that heart was almost bursting with its agony of
3560,WITHERED LEAVES.,"grief; but William was beside her, whispered words of tenderness and"
3561,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hope were murmured in her ear, and how could she break the spell? how"
3562,WITHERED LEAVES.,could she speak of the gathering storm? The commands of a stern father
3563,WITHERED LEAVES.,"were upon her, and she knew his indomitable spirit would never swerve"
3564,WITHERED LEAVES.,one inch from his determination.
3565,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3566,WITHERED LEAVES.,They sat till the family clock struck nine ere Hannah could
3567,WITHERED LEAVES.,"muster courage to announce her father's decision, and related the"
3568,WITHERED LEAVES.,"conversation that had just occurred. William was perfectly astonished,"
3569,WITHERED LEAVES.,"as he replied,"
3570,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3571,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""You certainly cannot yield to his commands? Hannah, the happiness of"
3572,WITHERED LEAVES.,"my life depends upon our union."""
3573,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3574,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Well, we will keep quiet a while and see what further light we can"
3575,WITHERED LEAVES.,"get upon the subject. I have a fearful foreboding that the haughty,"
3576,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stern looking stranger who has been here so much of late, has"
3577,WITHERED LEAVES.,"something to do with it. He has been officious in his attention to me,"
3578,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and I have trembled when I have seen his savage eyes fixed upon, me"
3579,WITHERED LEAVES.,with such a peculiar expression. And so we will be quiet and wait the
3580,WITHERED LEAVES.,"moving of the waters."""
3581,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3582,WITHERED LEAVES.,The following afternoon Captain Currier called his daughter into the
3583,WITHERED LEAVES.,"parlor, and closing the door, said abruptly,"
3584,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3585,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Well, Hannah, I 'spose you have squared up accounts with William, and"
3586,WITHERED LEAVES.,are now ready to enter a new firm. There is a noble chance for you my
3587,WITHERED LEAVES.,"gal. The rich Mr. Benson has offered his hand to you in marriage."""
3588,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3589,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Impossible! Why, father, is not he an Indian?"""
3590,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3591,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""No more of an Indian than you are; to be sure he is not quite as"
3592,WITHERED LEAVES.,"white as your milk and water Billy."""
3593,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3594,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I should think he was milk and molasses, at least, and the largest"
3595,WITHERED LEAVES.,"part molasses, but without its sweetness."""
3596,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3597,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Well, be that as it may, I'm thinking his thousands will make the"
3598,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dose quite palatable at any rate. You must know, Miss, my affairs at"
3599,WITHERED LEAVES.,"present are in an embarrassed state, and he proposes taking that large"
3600,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tract of land adjoining mine, and giving me a generous price upon it,"
3601,WITHERED LEAVES.,provided you will become his wife. He is going to lay out the ground
3602,WITHERED LEAVES.,"like a garden, build a princely mansion, and you are to be its"
3603,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mistress."""
3604,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3605,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O father, would you have me fall down and worship the golden calf?"""
3606,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3607,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""But you must obey me; I cannot, I must not be frustrated in this"
3608,WITHERED LEAVES.,"arrangement."""
3609,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3610,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""But why, father, cannot you and he complete your bargain without"
3611,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sacrificing my happiness on the shrine of Mammon?"""
3612,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3613,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""No, he will leave the country immediately unless you consent to marry"
3614,WITHERED LEAVES.,"him, and this, with my other property, is mortgaged, and cannot be"
3615,WITHERED LEAVES.,"redeemed, and beggary stares me in the face. This step, and this"
3616,WITHERED LEAVES.,"only, can save me. I told William the arrangement as he was marching"
3617,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hurriedly away this morning with Colonel Somer's regiment, who were"
3618,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ordered to reach the eastern border of the State as quick as possible,"
3619,WITHERED LEAVES.,as they fear an attack from the French and Indians in that quarter.
3620,WITHERED LEAVES.,Mr. Benson is eager to have the marriage take place as soon as
3621,WITHERED LEAVES.,"possible."""
3622,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3623,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Hannah sat like one in a dream for a moment, when she said,"
3624,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3625,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Father, has nature no voice to plead for me?"""
3626,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3627,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Child, it is your good I am seeking. How can you ever expect"
3628,WITHERED LEAVES.,happiness with William? It takes all he can earn to support his sick
3629,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mother, and let me tell you your chance will be a small one. Mr."
3630,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Benson's pockets are lined with gold, and he rides the best horse that"
3631,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the country can produce; and let me tell you, your love, as you call"
3632,WITHERED LEAVES.,"it, never yet put anything into the pot or kept it boiling, and it is"
3633,WITHERED LEAVES.,"well said, 'when poverty stalks in at the door love creeps out at the"
3634,WITHERED LEAVES.,"key hole.'"""
3635,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3636,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Well, father,"" said Hannah, rising up at her full height, ""if I am"
3637,WITHERED LEAVES.,"any judge in the case, that man is unprincipled, remorseless, and a"
3638,WITHERED LEAVES.,"villian."""
3639,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3640,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I think you are no judge. What can you know about it?"
3641,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3642,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Well, you chose to put the business in my hands, and I have arranged"
3643,WITHERED LEAVES.,it to my own liking. Now you must be prepared by one week from this
3644,WITHERED LEAVES.,"day to become Mrs. Benson."""
3645,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3646,WITHERED LEAVES.,"So saying he left the room, to bluster about Capulet like, to hurry"
3647,WITHERED LEAVES.,the coming event.
3648,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3649,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was soon known by every member of the family, that great"
3650,WITHERED LEAVES.,preparations were expected for the coming wedding. Deeds were
3651,WITHERED LEAVES.,"drawn up, the land transferred into the hands of Mr. Benson at an"
3652,WITHERED LEAVES.,"extravagant price, a large house erected upon it, and many carpenters"
3653,WITHERED LEAVES.,"employed to finish one room, and a bed-room, so that they could occupy"
3654,WITHERED LEAVES.,it till the rest could be completed.
3655,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3656,WITHERED LEAVES.,And so the shuttle was played to weave the woof into the meshy warp
3657,WITHERED LEAVES.,that had thus been spread.
3658,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3659,WITHERED LEAVES.,Hannah wept long after her father left her. She felt convinced it was
3660,WITHERED LEAVES.,"through his means William was pressed to go with Colonel Somers, and"
3661,WITHERED LEAVES.,her heart rebelled against his tyranny; and nothing would have induced
3662,WITHERED LEAVES.,her to yield but her father's assurance that that alone could save
3663,WITHERED LEAVES.,him from beggary. And she felt she would make the sacrifice for her
3664,WITHERED LEAVES.,father's sake.
3665,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3666,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As she entered the kitchen, Sarah, the black slave, met her with,"
3667,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3668,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Why, Miss Hanner, 'pears to me I should not like to swap Mr. Lawrence"
3669,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for Mr. Benson; 'pears he aint haff so perticler like."""
3670,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3671,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""It is my father's wish, and I suppose it must be complied with,"" and"
3672,WITHERED LEAVES.,"she passed out of the room to bury her feelings in her own bosom, and"
3673,WITHERED LEAVES.,nerve herself for the coming trial.
3674,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3675,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Massa is doing good business, Sambo,"" said Sarah to a black man that"
3676,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sat preparing some peas to plant, ""he selling tu gals at once."""
3677,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3678,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Yes, yes; but I guess Miss Hanner hab no choice,"" and he rolled up"
3679,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the whites of his eyes, and fetched a pompous nod of the head, as he"
3680,WITHERED LEAVES.,glanced at his sable companion.
3681,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3682,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""That does make some differ; now tree year don't seem bery long when"
3683,WITHERED LEAVES.,"we bese so much wid one tother."""
3684,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3685,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""The tree year most out now, white man buy his gal wid gold; but poor"
3686,WITHERED LEAVES.,"nigger hab to work hard for his'n. Well, we be free then."""
3687,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3688,WITHERED LEAVES.,The conversation was closed by Capt. Currier's sharp voice calling
3689,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Sambo to bring the peas. He hastily obeyed the summons, as he did so"
3690,WITHERED LEAVES.,"displaying by his open smile his ivory teeth to Sarah, who returned"
3691,WITHERED LEAVES.,the compliment in a very satisfactory manner.
3692,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3693,WITHERED LEAVES.,"All was bustle, stir, and preparation during the week. Dress makers,"
3694,WITHERED LEAVES.,"milliners, and almost all classes of people were called into"
3695,WITHERED LEAVES.,requisition.
3696,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3697,WITHERED LEAVES.,Mr. Benson strove hard to play the agreeable; but Hannah could
3698,WITHERED LEAVES.,"scarcely endure him. And the week passed away, as all weeks will pass,"
3699,WITHERED LEAVES.,whether laden with joy or sorrow; and the pale bride stood trembling
3700,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by the altar of Hymen, and the solemn words were passed that united"
3701,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the destinies of two immortal spirits, and the recording angel"
3702,WITHERED LEAVES.,registered them in heaven.
3703,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3704,WITHERED LEAVES.,"After partaking of a sumptuous dinner, according to the custom of"
3705,WITHERED LEAVES.,"those days, they entered a splendid carriage Mr. Benson had purchased"
3706,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for the occasion, and with Sambo for a driver and Sarah for a waiting"
3707,WITHERED LEAVES.,"maid, set out upon their wedding tour. But we will not accompany them."
3708,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3709,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Suffice it to say, it was productive of little happiness to the new"
3710,WITHERED LEAVES.,"married pair. Sambo and Sarah enjoyed it very well, as she often rode"
3711,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with him upon the driver's box, and they thus had a delightful view of"
3712,WITHERED LEAVES.,the country.
3713,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3714,WITHERED LEAVES.,"On their return, their house was ready for their reception, or at"
3715,WITHERED LEAVES.,least so that they could live in it while the other part was finished.
3716,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3717,WITHERED LEAVES.,Hannah had frequently been surprised by her husband's frequent
3718,WITHERED LEAVES.,"potations of brandy during their journey, and his whole bearing had"
3719,WITHERED LEAVES.,been haughty and reserved.
3720,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3721,WITHERED LEAVES.,"They had been at home but a short time, when, after being absent one"
3722,WITHERED LEAVES.,"night and day, Mr. Benson returned home with a dark frown resting upon"
3723,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his countenance; he slammed the door, kicked every chair that came in"
3724,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his way, and stamping about, went and dismissed all his hands, took"
3725,WITHERED LEAVES.,"another dram from his brandy bottle, and sat moodily down by the fire,"
3726,WITHERED LEAVES.,grumbling because supper was not on the table.
3727,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3728,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Poor Hannah pressed her hand upon her throbbing heart, and struggled"
3729,WITHERED LEAVES.,with the tears that rose to her eyes and seemed scalding her very eye
3730,WITHERED LEAVES.,balls with their burning heat. There was a choking sensation in her
3731,WITHERED LEAVES.,"throat, but she swallowed it back, and prepared supper in the best"
3732,WITHERED LEAVES.,"manner she was capable. Her husband seated himself at the table, took"
3733,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a biscuit, looked at it, flung it back upon the plate, called his tea"
3734,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dish water, and throwing back his chair hastily, left the table."
3735,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3736,WITHERED LEAVES.,But why dwell upon the sorrowful years they spent together? He ever
3737,WITHERED LEAVES.,came like a dark shadow upon the sunlight of home. Children gathered
3738,WITHERED LEAVES.,"around their fire side, but there was no gentle corner for them in his"
3739,WITHERED LEAVES.,heart.
3740,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3741,WITHERED LEAVES.,"His only son was ever with him like his shadow, drinking in his"
3742,WITHERED LEAVES.,"precepts, practising his examples, breathing his oaths, domineering"
3743,WITHERED LEAVES.,"over his mother and sisters, and a terror to the neighborhood."
3744,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3745,WITHERED LEAVES.,"His father telling him, he was in hopes to see the time he would dance"
3746,WITHERED LEAVES.,"on Dr. Somers' grave, as he hated him with a perfect hatred, because"
3747,WITHERED LEAVES.,"he had been his wife's attending physician, when she had been sick"
3748,WITHERED LEAVES.,during the years they had lived together.
3749,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3750,WITHERED LEAVES.,"James, for such was the name of the son, was instructed to hate"
3751,WITHERED LEAVES.,"everybody that came in his way, and, of course, was hated by every"
3752,WITHERED LEAVES.,one.
3753,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3754,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The money that came by gambling, went in the same way, and"
3755,WITHERED LEAVES.,poverty--abject poverty--was now an inmate of their dwelling.
3756,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3757,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The house remained unfinished; the frame, which had never been"
3758,WITHERED LEAVES.,"clap-boarded, had gone to decay in a great measure; and when one meal"
3759,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was obtained, they scarcely knew where another would come from."
3760,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3761,WITHERED LEAVES.,Discord reigned among them. Hannah was a wreck of her former self. She
3762,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had strung up her patience to its utmost tension, and would often bear"
3763,WITHERED LEAVES.,the scorn and abuse of her husband in sorrowful silence.
3764,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3765,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But this state of things passed away, and when her children shared"
3766,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in her sufferings, the bitter waters were stirred in their deep"
3767,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fountains, and she became a worn woman, with a hasty spirit. The"
3768,WITHERED LEAVES.,"biting retort was now often upon her lips, and she became in a true"
3769,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sense of the word, what might well be called a scold."
3770,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3771,WITHERED LEAVES.,"One gloomy fall day, when the sighing winds shook the mellow apples"
3772,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from the trees in the large thrifty orchard, that stood before the"
3773,WITHERED LEAVES.,"house, casting so deep a shade that the rays of the sun could scarcely"
3774,WITHERED LEAVES.,"penetrate it, and the old house looked blacker for the rain that had"
3775,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fallen upon it, Mr. Benson was seized for debt, and, conveyed to jail."
3776,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3777,WITHERED LEAVES.,During his absence Mrs. Benson purchased some apples of the man that
3778,WITHERED LEAVES.,"then owned the orchard, and dried them, hoping to obtain some"
3779,WITHERED LEAVES.,"needful clothing for herself and children. She cleaned her ceiling,"
3780,WITHERED LEAVES.,"whitewashed the plastering, and made everything about the house look"
3781,WITHERED LEAVES.,"as comfortable as possible, and enjoyed the privilege, at least, of"
3782,WITHERED LEAVES.,"doing as she pleased, without being found fault with, which was to her"
3783,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a great luxury, as her expressed wishes were generally vetoed at once."
3784,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3785,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She was a true mother, and strove to bring her children up in the"
3786,WITHERED LEAVES.,"paths of truth and honesty. But there was such an opposing current,"
3787,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and such frequent bickerings between herself and husband, that they"
3788,WITHERED LEAVES.,"caught the infection, and seemed to live only to torment each other."
3789,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3790,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O,"" said Mrs. Benson one day, to her sister Sarah, who was spending"
3791,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a, day with her, ""this is the princely mansion father promised me, as"
3792,WITHERED LEAVES.,a reward for giving up all my cherished hopes. Poor William has lost
3793,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his dear mother, I hear."""
3794,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3795,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Yes, she died one day last week; she liked much where they lived, and"
3796,WITHERED LEAVES.,"after William came into possession of his uncle's princely fortune,"
3797,WITHERED LEAVES.,her life was spent in ease and affluence. He is likely to become one
3798,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the richest men in the country, and he is loved for his kindness"
3799,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and respected for his virtues. Your marriage doomed him to celibacy."""
3800,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3801,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A shade rested for a moment upon Mrs. Benson's brow, as she said,"
3802,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3803,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O, these dark brown years have brought no joy to me in their course."
3804,WITHERED LEAVES.,How I have lived I scarcely know. How dim-sighted is human reason? The
3805,WITHERED LEAVES.,"poor William is now the rich man, and the rich Benson is the poor one."
3806,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Could father know the misery I have undergone, he would think his"
3807,WITHERED LEAVES.,"comforts dearly purchased; but he is gone from earth, and I will not"
3808,WITHERED LEAVES.,"reproache his memory; but, oh, it has been hard--very hard."""
3809,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3810,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""But come, Sarah, come into this old room with me, and help me pack my"
3811,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dried apple for market. Is'nt it nice? I took great pains with it, as"
3812,WITHERED LEAVES.,I wished it to fetch the first price in the market. I am going to get
3813,WITHERED LEAVES.,me a new cheap calico dress. This old patched faded thing is the only
3814,WITHERED LEAVES.,one I have.
3815,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3816,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I have wove a great deal this fall, and I think what I shall get for"
3817,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that and the apple, will fix the children and me up quite comfortably."
3818,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The children paid for these apples, by picking up apples for Mr."
3819,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Lambert, and he says he shall want them again. I don't know as I care"
3820,WITHERED LEAVES.,"much how long Benson stays in jail, for I enjoy myself much better"
3821,WITHERED LEAVES.,"than I did when he was at home, scolding round all the time. And it"
3822,WITHERED LEAVES.,"has made a perfect vixen of me, and I scold almost as bad as he does;"
3823,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and the children catch it, and we have a little bedlam here all the"
3824,WITHERED LEAVES.,"time; O, I wish it were not so, I cannot lie down quietly and sleep at"

3826,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3827,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O, sister, I hope nothing worse than has come. I am glad to hear your"
3828,WITHERED LEAVES.,"prospects look more favorable, and wish it were in my power to help"
3829,WITHERED LEAVES.,"you. If you get a dress I will help you make it, and the children's"
3830,WITHERED LEAVES.,"clothing. But I forgot to tell you Sarah is dead, and Sambo has got a"
3831,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cancer, and it is thought he will survive her but a short time."""
3832,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3833,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Indeed; well, she was a faithful servant, and has gone to her reward;"
3834,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and poor Sambo, how patiently he toiled, early and late, to purchase"
3835,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her freedom, and they were very happy."""
3836,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3837,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O, yes, because they loved each other, and there was no one to"
3838,WITHERED LEAVES.,"interfere with them."""
3839,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3840,WITHERED LEAVES.,They were now startled by hearing Mr. Benson chiding the children in
3841,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a loud, angry voice, with many oaths, for leaving the gate open,"
3842,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and letting a cow into a small yard of shrivelled, stinted looking"
3843,WITHERED LEAVES.,cabbages.
3844,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3845,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The children scampered for the house, with terrified looks,"
3846,WITHERED LEAVES.,"whispering, ""father has come,"" and crouching down in a heap in one"
3847,WITHERED LEAVES.,"corner of the room, remained very quiet; the old cow ran for the"
3848,WITHERED LEAVES.,"street, with Mr. Benson at her heels, storming furiously, and plying a"
3849,WITHERED LEAVES.,"large stick across her back, which he had picked up in his rage."
3850,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3851,WITHERED LEAVES.,The sisters placed the large bundle of dried apple in as secure a
3852,WITHERED LEAVES.,"place as possible, and returned to the kitchen."
3853,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3854,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The door was burst violently open, and Mr. Benson entered the room,"
3855,WITHERED LEAVES.,"exclaiming, as he did so,"
3856,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3857,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""What in thunder is going on here?"""
3858,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3859,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And he proceeded to disarrange chairs, tables and everything that"
3860,WITHERED LEAVES.,"came in his way, till the house was all in confusion. He went to the"
3861,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cupboard, that stood in the corner of the room, to get a large jug he"
3862,WITHERED LEAVES.,"used to keep brandy in, in his better days, but which now was often"
3863,WITHERED LEAVES.,"filled with New England rum. Not finding it, he almost screamed,"
3864,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3865,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Hannah, you Jezebel, where is my jug?"""
3866,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3867,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I thought I would sell it, as you were boarding out."""
3868,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3869,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Woman,"" shouted he, ""that shall be a dear jug to you."""
3870,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3871,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""It has been that already."""
3872,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3873,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The enraged husband cast at her the look of a fiend, and passed on to"
3874,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the adjoining room, which was calculated to be an elegant parlor when"
3875,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the house was raised, but which was now converted into a store room,"
3876,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for old barrels, old baskets, old hats and bonnets, and, in fine,"
3877,WITHERED LEAVES.,a great variety of old things. In one corner stood a little old
3878,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bedstead, with an old flock bed, covered with patched sheets and a"
3879,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ragged quilt, where James slept. The loom was in that room and the"
3880,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spinning wheels; an old churn and many other things, too numerous to"
3881,WITHERED LEAVES.,mention.
3882,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3883,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mr. Benson reached up his hand, to take down a large bunch of woolen"
3884,WITHERED LEAVES.,"yarn that hung suspended on a nail. His wife sprang forward, saying,"
3885,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Do not touch that--it is not mine."""
3886,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3887,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I don't care whose it is. I must and will have something that will"

3889,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3890,WITHERED LEAVES.,"At that moment, seeing the package of dried apple, he pounced upon"
3891,WITHERED LEAVES.,"it, like a tiger upon its prey, and bore it rapidly away, with the"
3892,WITHERED LEAVES.,remonstrances of a weeping wife ringing in his ears.
3893,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3894,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And the traffickers in human souls bought it at a price, paid him in"
3895,WITHERED LEAVES.,"liquid fire, and he returned to his home, more fiend than when he left"
3896,WITHERED LEAVES.,it. The wife's dress was gone; the comfortable things she hoped to
3897,WITHERED LEAVES.,procure for the children were gone. She sat up and toiled late at
3898,WITHERED LEAVES.,night--and all for what? To procure that poison for her husband that
3899,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was contaminating his and her own soul, and cast such a blight upon"
3900,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her home. Was it not enough that their house and land were mortgaged,"
3901,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their horse and carriage gone? but must she toil with her own hands,"
3902,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to satisfy that appetite that cries, ""give, give?"" As these thoughts"
3903,WITHERED LEAVES.,"passed through Mrs. Benson's mind, she mentally exclaimed,"
3904,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3905,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O, it is a sad thing to be a drunkard's wife."""
3906,WITHERED LEAVES.,
3907,WITHERED LEAVES.,A few weeks after she went to an old chest that stood in one corner of
3908,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the room, to get a piece of woolen goods she had carefully prepared"
3909,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for the market, which would bring her several dollars. She had placed"
3910,WITHERED LEAVES.,"an old band box, quill wheel and some other rubbish upon the chest,"
3911,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to conceal it from view as much as possible. Upon opening it, she"
3912,WITHERED LEAVES.,"discovered her treasure was gone, and she knew too well, for what"
3913,WITHERED LEAVES.,"purpose. The son, too, drank with his father, and got so much the"
3914,WITHERED LEAVES.,"start of him in brutality, that even he cowered before him, thus"
3915,WITHERED LEAVES.,"realizing that ""He that soweth the wind shall reap the whirlwind."" But"
3916,WITHERED LEAVES.,"those years passed on; the children grew up in their perverseness, a"

3919,WITHERED LEAVES.,"No prayer ever ascended, like sweet incense, from those hearts; no"

3926,WITHERED LEAVES.,"disgrace, with a man equally miserable, till the house was demolished"

4117,WITHERED LEAVES.,"weakness, were the only indications of the fearful work that was"
4118,WITHERED LEAVES.,"progressing within. A bright flush rested upon the lily cheek, and"
4119,WITHERED LEAVES.,none who looked upon the unwonted brilliancy of those eyes ever could
4120,WITHERED LEAVES.,forget their lustre. The pure spirit seemed to look forth from their
4121,WITHERED LEAVES.,"azure depths. A moan seldom escaped her lips, but she would lay quiet"
4122,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in her little cradle, looking out unmoved upon the business and stir"
4123,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of that life, upon which she had so briefly entered, but where she was"

4125,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4126,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Anxiously did the fond mother watch over her precious one, and"

4131,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4132,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But could this bribe death? O no, the destroyer stayed not in his"

4135,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4136,WITHERED LEAVES.,It was a chilly day in early spring; vegetation was just arousing from
4137,WITHERED LEAVES.,"winter's sleep, and the spring blossoms were just beginning to peep"
4138,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from their casing of green, when this little bud of beauty perished"
4139,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from earth. She lay in the cradle usually, because it wearied her to"

4141,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4142,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was noon, when the mother bent over her to administer some"

4148,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""My dear child, I shall not lay you down again till you look better."""
4149,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4150,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She looked at her a few moments, her blue orbs were turned to heaven,"

4153,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4154,WITHERED LEAVES.,"There was soon an effort to vomit, succeeded by the fearful death"
4155,WITHERED LEAVES.,rattle that comes but once in human life. It was the struggle that
4156,WITHERED LEAVES.,"must come to all, sooner or later. The angel of death was leading this"
4157,WITHERED LEAVES.,"feeble infant through the valley of the shadow of death, by a gentle"
4158,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hand; one little struggle, one gentle sigh, one little quiver of the"
4159,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lip, and the sinless spirit had departed ere the father and brothers,"
4160,WITHERED LEAVES.,"who had been hastily summoned, reached her side."
4161,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4162,WITHERED LEAVES.,Beautiful beyond description was the touch of death as it lingered
4163,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon that marble brow, and rested upon the beautifully chiselled"

4165,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4166,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She was arrayed in a simple white robe, and laid into her cradle,"

4169,WITHERED LEAVES.,"gifts were some for the little one, but those little eyes were closed,"
4170,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and those little hands that used to be raised with so much fondness,"
4171,WITHERED LEAVES.,were now stiff and cold in death; but how lovely! Her grave was made
4172,WITHERED LEAVES.,in the headland of the garden; a tall lilac stood upon one side of
4173,WITHERED LEAVES.,"it, and a fragrant rose bush stood upon the other No stone marked the"
4174,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spot, but will she be forgotten on the morning of the resurrection?"
4175,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4176,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Years passed on, many silent years, for we heard no sounds to tell us"
4177,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that time was threading the mazy thoroughfares of human life, stealing"
4178,WITHERED LEAVES.,"noiselessly through our dwellings, and pressing his way with us to the"
4179,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ocean of eternity, hastening on to the period when he shall come to an"
4180,WITHERED LEAVES.,"end, and the great angel shall swear there shall be time no longer."
4181,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But so it was; years had been borne away by his rapid flight, and laid"
4182,WITHERED LEAVES.,"side by side with those that passed before the flood, and change had"
4183,WITHERED LEAVES.,come.
4184,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4185,WITHERED LEAVES.,Many voices that lisped their matin and their vesper hymns by one
4186,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hearth stone, were now scattered far and wide, and other homes had"
4187,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sprung up, and the children had become parents, and new duties"
4188,WITHERED LEAVES.,"devolved upon them. Some had passed the meridian of life, the sun of"
4189,WITHERED LEAVES.,"some had reached their noon, while others were climbing up the eastern"
4190,WITHERED LEAVES.,"summit. But as yet death had spared that numerous, household; but now"
4191,WITHERED LEAVES.,he was watching for his prey. A son who had reached the meridian of
4192,WITHERED LEAVES.,"life, with fair prospects and an unblemished reputation, was selected."
4193,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4194,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He had consecrated himself to God, had put on Christ by baptism, and"
4195,WITHERED LEAVES.,"well did he adorn his profession, living a consistent Christian life."
4196,WITHERED LEAVES.,But death marked him for his victim.
4197,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4198,WITHERED LEAVES.,It were needless now to tell of all the secret underminings of life's
4199,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hidden springs. He was cheerfully, hopefully looking forward to a long"
4200,WITHERED LEAVES.,"life of usefulness, and striving to attain to greater proficiency in"
4201,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his profession, for he was a physician. But the strength of manhood,"
4202,WITHERED LEAVES.,"integrity of principle, nor Christian virtue could shield him from the"
4203,WITHERED LEAVES.,stealthy foe that was infusing its poison through the secret avenues
4204,WITHERED LEAVES.,of life.
4205,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4206,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Strength declined, the cough increased, night sweats came on, and"
4207,WITHERED LEAVES.,"one occupation after another had to be relinquished, till he was a"
4208,WITHERED LEAVES.,"confirmed invalid, and when he became next convinced that he must die,"
4209,WITHERED LEAVES.,the business of his remaining time upon earth was to make preparation
4210,WITHERED LEAVES.,for that event.
4211,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4212,WITHERED LEAVES.,"His countenance ever wore a smile, and he conversed cheerfully with"
4213,WITHERED LEAVES.,his friends.
4214,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4215,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He sold his place, which was one he had desired for many years,"
4216,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and which he had recently purchased, anticipating a long life of"
4217,WITHERED LEAVES.,"usefulness in the bosom of his family, which consisted of his wife and"
4218,WITHERED LEAVES.,"one son. But he cheerfully resigned it, and settled all his business"
4219,WITHERED LEAVES.,"as far as was in his power, made the best possible provision for his"
4220,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wife and son, and retired with them to her paternal home to prepare"
4221,WITHERED LEAVES.,the inner man for the great change that was before him.
4222,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4223,WITHERED LEAVES.,"His mind was relieved from earthly cares, every thing being arranged"
4224,WITHERED LEAVES.,"as he desired, and he used to say,"
4225,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4226,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I have 'set my house in order,' and have nothing to do but die."""
4227,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4228,WITHERED LEAVES.,The things of eternity occupied his entire thoughts; he seldom spoke
4229,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of his sufferings as being great, but expressed thankfulness that he"
4230,WITHERED LEAVES.,was passing so easily away. But it appeared different to his friends
4231,WITHERED LEAVES.,that looked upon him. He could lay only upon one side for several
4232,WITHERED LEAVES.,"months before he died, and he had painful ulcers upon several parts of"
4233,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the body, and a constant cough, with laborious breathing and profuse"
4234,WITHERED LEAVES.,"night sweats, accompanied by great emaciation. These were the most"
4235,WITHERED LEAVES.,prominent features in the fearful disease.
4236,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4237,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But he would allow no one to remain with him during the night,"
4238,WITHERED LEAVES.,"affirming it was unnecessary for any one to be disturbed, thus"
4239,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spending his restless, weary nights in communion with his Saviour and"
4240,WITHERED LEAVES.,his God.
4241,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4242,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He made all the arrangements for his funeral, telling his friends not"
4243,WITHERED LEAVES.,to weep for him. He hoped as his usefulness on earth was so soon to
4244,WITHERED LEAVES.,"end, his death might be sanctified so as to be the means of inducing"
4245,WITHERED LEAVES.,his unconverted friends to seek that preparation of heart that is
4246,WITHERED LEAVES.,necessary for entrance into a better life.
4247,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4248,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He told his wife the manner in which he should probably die, and"
4249,WITHERED LEAVES.,endeavored to prepare her mind for it. He had distressing turns of
4250,WITHERED LEAVES.,"suffocation, so that they were obliged to open all the windows and"
4251,WITHERED LEAVES.,"doors for the benefit of the air, and he long expected every turn"
4252,WITHERED LEAVES.,would be the last.
4253,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4254,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A few days before his death, his aged mother and a sister visited"
4255,WITHERED LEAVES.,him. He conversed with them cheerfully upon the arrangements of his
4256,WITHERED LEAVES.,"funeral; told them he was ready to be offered, and should meet the"
4257,WITHERED LEAVES.,appointment as cheerfully as ever he met any in his life. He consulted
4258,WITHERED LEAVES.,"them about the propriety of the hour of the funeral, and some other"
4259,WITHERED LEAVES.,"things in connection with the coming event, as he would were he making"
4260,WITHERED LEAVES.,preparations for a journey. When the aged mother pressed the hand of
4261,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her son for the last time on earth, she said with a smile,"
4262,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4263,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I can only wish the presence of your Saviour, to go with you, and"
4264,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lighten the 'dark valley of the shadow of death.'"""
4265,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4266,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He looked fondly in her face, while a smile of ineffable sweetness"
4267,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beamed upon his countenance. ""You could not wish me a better wish,"
4268,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mother."""
4269,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4270,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I shall soon follow you, my son; I do not think I shall live the winter"
4271,WITHERED LEAVES.,"out,"" said the mother, as she unclasped her hand from the son's, that"
4272,WITHERED LEAVES.,"she had taken, for the last time."
4273,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4274,WITHERED LEAVES.,"That mother's hand had been extended, to guide him through the wayward"
4275,WITHERED LEAVES.,"paths of childhood and youth, to strengthen and comfort him, and"
4276,WITHERED LEAVES.,smooth many rough places in the pathway of manhood; but now it was
4277,WITHERED LEAVES.,"withdrawn upon the brink of the grave--it could not assist, could not"
4278,WITHERED LEAVES.,support him; but she committed him to that arm that is mighty to save.
4279,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4280,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was a mild day in early autumn, when the pale messenger came to"
4281,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beckon him away. He had tasted of the early autumnal fruits, had drank"
4282,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the delicious juice from her purple grape, and watched the early"
4283,WITHERED LEAVES.,symptoms of decay that were visible in some withering flower or fading
4284,WITHERED LEAVES.,"leaf, and felt that ""passing away"" was legibly written on all earthly"
4285,WITHERED LEAVES.,"things. Once, and once only, he had prayed, ""O, my Father, if it be"
4286,WITHERED LEAVES.,"possible, let this cup pass from me, but thy will be done."""
4287,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4288,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He failed fast the last few hours of his life, losing all appetite"
4289,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for nourishment, and having more frequent turns of suffocation, and a"
4290,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sister was sent for. Scarcely had she arrived, when he remarked to his"
4291,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wife that he felt very easy; but as it was time, he would take his"
4292,WITHERED LEAVES.,"medicine. He took out the quantity upon the point of his knife, and"
4293,WITHERED LEAVES.,"after taking it, lay back upon his pillow, apparently asleep. He"
4294,WITHERED LEAVES.,"started suddenly, looked wildly up, and told them he was choking"
4295,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to death. They raised his head, and used their accustomed means to"
4296,WITHERED LEAVES.,"relieve him, but all to no avail. The death dew stood in large drops"
4297,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon his forehead, and the film gathered over the sparkling eye and"
4298,WITHERED LEAVES.,shut out the light of earth forever. He stretched out one hand and
4299,WITHERED LEAVES.,"placed it upon the head of his son, who came hurriedly to his bedside,"
4300,WITHERED LEAVES.,"crying out, in piteous accents,"
4301,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4302,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""O, father, father,"" and stood sobbing beside him."
4303,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4304,WITHERED LEAVES.,This was his only recognition of any one. But the struggle was soon
4305,WITHERED LEAVES.,"over, and the spirit had burst the barriers that held it to its clay"
4306,WITHERED LEAVES.,tenement and passed away to a brighter world.
4307,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4308,WITHERED LEAVES.,His sun set at noon; but his memory has left a sweet fragrance behind
4309,WITHERED LEAVES.,"it, grateful to the surviving friends, who are called upon to follow"
4310,WITHERED LEAVES.,his pious example.
4311,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4312,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He was borne to the Cemetery, and buried in a spot, which he had"
4313,WITHERED LEAVES.,"selected a few weeks before, in company with his aged mother, by a"
4314,WITHERED LEAVES.,"long train of weeping friends, for he had been very dear to us, and"
4315,WITHERED LEAVES.,"nature would have her tribute, and it filled our hearts with sadness,"
4316,WITHERED LEAVES.,when we realized that we should see that loved form on earth no more.
4317,WITHERED LEAVES.,Yet we rejoiced that he had died in the glorious hope of a blessed
4318,WITHERED LEAVES.,"immortality, and that we could say, in the impressive language of"
4319,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the text that was chosen for his funeral sermon, ""Our friend Lazarus"
4320,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sleepeth."" Sweet be thy sleep, dear brother, during the night of"
4321,WITHERED LEAVES.,death; but the morning will come--the glorious morning of the
4322,WITHERED LEAVES.,"resurrection--and unlock the portals of the tomb, and the dead shall"
4323,WITHERED LEAVES.,"come forth, the righteous clothed in eternal youth, shall never die,"
4324,WITHERED LEAVES.,the wicked sinking into the second death that has no end.
4325,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4326,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Sober autumn perfected his work of decay, and dreary winter spread his"
4327,WITHERED LEAVES.,"snowy shroud over the barren globe, when the aged mother laid down"
4328,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the bed of death. Her infant had passed away, in the very dawn"
4329,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of its existence. Her son had sunk down, while his meridian sun was"
4330,WITHERED LEAVES.,shining in its noonday splendor; but she had lived till the winter of
4331,WITHERED LEAVES.,"life had scattered its snows upon her head, and was now falling, like"
4332,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a shock of corn, fully ripe. She was ready to be bidden suddenly"
4333,WITHERED LEAVES.,"away, for she was ever watching for the coming of the bridegroom."
4334,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Consumption had long been preying upon her form, and paving her way to"
4335,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the tomb; but she could look calmly upon the prospect, and contemplate"
4336,WITHERED LEAVES.,the struggle of death without shrinking from it.
4337,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4338,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She had long been an humble follower of the meek and lowly Jesus,"
4339,WITHERED LEAVES.,and his religion diffused its divine light over the most trifling
4340,WITHERED LEAVES.,incidents of her life. She ever looked upon the fashions of this world
4341,WITHERED LEAVES.,"as passing away, and never conformed to them, or the manners of the"
4342,WITHERED LEAVES.,"world; but taking the holy word of God for her example, endeavored to"
4343,WITHERED LEAVES.,"imbibe its precepts, and practice its requirements. In profession of"
4344,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her faith, she united with the Congregational Church, at the early age"
4345,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of nineteen, and at the age of seventy-six years, could look back upon"
4346,WITHERED LEAVES.,a life spent to the honor and glory of him who had redeemed her with
4347,WITHERED LEAVES.,his precious blood. She offered up her children upon the altar of her
4348,WITHERED LEAVES.,"heart's purest affections, consecrating them to God, by having them"
4349,WITHERED LEAVES.,"publicly dedicated, thus performing what she felt to be an important"
4350,WITHERED LEAVES.,duty of a Christian mother.
4351,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4352,WITHERED LEAVES.,Many an adverse wind had she encountered--that weary voyager on life's
4353,WITHERED LEAVES.,"troubled sea; but Christ had long been her pilot, and now he was about"
4354,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to moor her frail bark into the haven of peace, and the tumultuous"
4355,WITHERED LEAVES.,"waves were hushed, while the loving Saviour whispered, ""Peace, be"
4356,WITHERED LEAVES.,"still."""
4357,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4358,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She could converse but little, and was with difficulty understood; but"
4359,WITHERED LEAVES.,every word breathed of faith and hope. On the afternoon before her
4360,WITHERED LEAVES.,"death, she repeated these beautiful lines, and, apparently, felt their"
4361,WITHERED LEAVES.,import:
4362,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4363,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Jesus can make a dying bed"
4364,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Feel soft as downy pillows are,"
4365,WITHERED LEAVES.,"While on his breast I lean my head,"
4366,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And breathe my life out sweetly there."""
4367,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4368,WITHERED LEAVES.,She wished to have her robe and cap prepared so that she might see
4369,WITHERED LEAVES.,"them before her death. She expressed anxiety for her aged companion,"
4370,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to whom she had been united fifty-five years, and who was dangerously"
4371,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sick at the time, and thought he would never recover; but would soon"
4372,WITHERED LEAVES.,"drop into a deep stupor, occasioned by ossification of the brain."
4373,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4374,WITHERED LEAVES.,"During the night her feet and hands grew cold, and the worn spirit"
4375,WITHERED LEAVES.,seemed struggling to depart.
4376,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4377,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She would frequently arouse from her stupor, and speak a word or two"
4378,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to her attendants, saying to one,"
4379,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4380,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""You did not expect me to be found alone now, did you?"""
4381,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4382,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She repeated, ""In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not"
4383,WITHERED LEAVES.,"so I would have told you; I go to prepare a place for you."""
4384,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4385,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She lingered till about ten o'clock in the fore-noon, then calling for"
4386,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the absent members of the family, she desired to be raised up. Her son"
4387,WITHERED LEAVES.,"supported her in his arms, the feeble lamp of life flickered a moment"
4388,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in its socket, there was a little struggle, and that pure breast lay"
4389,WITHERED LEAVES.,free from the care or burden of life. Those loving eyes had looked
4390,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their last upon her dear children, that stood weeping by her bedside,"
4391,WITHERED LEAVES.,and the toil worn hands were laid cold and pulseless upon her peaceful
4392,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bosom, and she was now at rest with her Saviour, ""in the house of many"
4393,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mansions."" Those dear hands that had been so active, administering to"
4394,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the necessities of her family, had now ceased their labor, and lay"
4395,WITHERED LEAVES.,"inactive, in their marble whiteness."
4396,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4397,WITHERED LEAVES.,"How many thoughts come surging up, from the wellspring of memory, as"
4398,WITHERED LEAVES.,"we looked upon her in her last repose, and glanced retrospectively"
4399,WITHERED LEAVES.,upon her useful and exemplary life. Again we heard the rich
4400,WITHERED LEAVES.,"instruction that had fallen from those pale lips, and a new-purpose"
4401,WITHERED LEAVES.,sprung up in the heart--a new desire to be more entirely consecrated
4402,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to God, that our path might be the path of the just, that ""grows"
4403,WITHERED LEAVES.,"brighter and brighter to the perfect day."""
4404,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4405,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Her coffin was carried to the bedside of her husband, who was unable"
4406,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to rise, and too sick to realize the extent of his sorrow, and so he"
4407,WITHERED LEAVES.,"looked for the last time upon the countenance of that dear wife, who"
4408,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had been the partaker in his joys and sorrows, through their long"
4409,WITHERED LEAVES.,"journey together. It was fifty-five years since their union, and now"
4410,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the bond was broken. One was an angel of light, the other was left to"
4411,WITHERED LEAVES.,"drift awhile upon the ocean of life, ere his frail bark sails over"
4412,WITHERED LEAVES.,death's sluggish stream.
4413,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4414,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She, too, was conveyed to the Cemetery, and laid beside her dear son,"
4415,WITHERED LEAVES.,who had been deposited there a few month's previous. And they followed
4416,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her, slowly and sadly, along the same road she had passed over half a"
4417,WITHERED LEAVES.,"century before, when she was borne into the neighborhood, a young"
4418,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and joyous bride, and passed the house that was then built for the"
4419,WITHERED LEAVES.,reception of the young mistress.
4420,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4421,WITHERED LEAVES.,Here she commenced her first experience in the trials and duties of
4422,WITHERED LEAVES.,house-keeping; and here were opened the deep fountains of a mother's
4423,WITHERED LEAVES.,"love. This had been for many years the theatre of her life, where she"
4424,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had acted a conspicuous part in its changeful drama, and where still"
4425,WITHERED LEAVES.,"linger many footprints time will never efface, for true it is,"
4426,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the influence still lives, and will be transmitted to succeeding"
4427,WITHERED LEAVES.,"generations. The scenes that were so familiar to her eyes, were now"
4428,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hid from her sight, and she rested in the Cemetery, within a few feet"
4429,WITHERED LEAVES.,of the land that was once contained in their own farm.
4430,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4431,WITHERED LEAVES.,"One son, the eldest of the family, after being absent from home many"
4432,WITHERED LEAVES.,"years, died in a land of strangers, and little was ever known of his"
4433,WITHERED LEAVES.,"death or burial. The dear babe was left, far away, and the mother and"
4434,WITHERED LEAVES.,"son slept side by side, in the Cemetery, waiting the time when other"
4435,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dear friends shall come and, lay down by their sides in that quiet"
4436,WITHERED LEAVES.,resting place.
4437,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4438,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The tall trees stand waving in the wind, and seem beckoning the weary"
4439,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ones of earth, to lay down beneath their cooling shades."
4440,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4441,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The silvery stream dances on, making sweet music in its winding"
4442,WITHERED LEAVES.,"course, ever murmuring a sweet requiem to the dead. Birds warble their"
4443,WITHERED LEAVES.,"matin songs in the branches, and the night dew water the graves with"
4444,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their tears, while the winds sigh over the grassy mounds; and all on"
4445,WITHERED LEAVES.,"earth must make their bed with them, and every step we take in the"
4446,WITHERED LEAVES.,"journey of life, is a step towards the tomb, whatever other duty may"
4447,WITHERED LEAVES.,be performed. Solemn is the reflection that there is an open grave
4448,WITHERED LEAVES.,"before every one that lives, and were we so situated that we could"
4449,WITHERED LEAVES.,"define our progress, and notice each day's approach to its confines,"
4450,WITHERED LEAVES.,we should feel sensibly that we were hastening on to join the pale
4451,WITHERED LEAVES.,"nations of the dead, and fill our respective places in the land of"
4452,WITHERED LEAVES.,darkness and shadow of death.
4453,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4454,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But we will leave the dear infant, the brother, and the mother, to"
4455,WITHERED LEAVES.,that rest that remains for the people of God; they have fallen victims
4456,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to consumption, with the vast multitudes that have fallen a prey to"
4457,WITHERED LEAVES.,the ruthless destroyer.
4458,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4459,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Memory brings up, upon her retentive tablet, the recollection of a"
4460,WITHERED LEAVES.,"family that fell before its withering blight, ere the elasticity of"
4461,WITHERED LEAVES.,youth had passed away.
4462,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4463,WITHERED LEAVES.,The first that died was a young wife and mother. She faded like the
4464,WITHERED LEAVES.,"early spring flowers, and soon her brothers and sisters younger than"
4465,WITHERED LEAVES.,"she were laid by her side in the silent chambers of death, all in the"
4466,WITHERED LEAVES.,"vigor and beauty of youth. The rose faded suddenly upon their cheeks,"
4467,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and they fell before thee, thou ruthless destroyer of the generations"
4468,WITHERED LEAVES.,of men.
4469,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4470,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The infant of a few days laid down its young life, and joined the"
4471,WITHERED LEAVES.,multitude in the place of graves.
4472,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4473,WITHERED LEAVES.,"One young man just verging upon manhood, was cut suddenly down with"
4474,WITHERED LEAVES.,"but little warning. He apparently had a slow fever, and had been"
4475,WITHERED LEAVES.,"confined a few days at the house of a friend, but had so far recovered"
4476,WITHERED LEAVES.,"as to anticipate a visit to his family on horseback, as the distance"
4477,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was short, and the doctor had recommended that exercise. But on the"
4478,WITHERED LEAVES.,"appointed day, while his horse stood saddled at the door, he came in"
4479,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from a short walk, and asked a niece to help him off with his coat,"
4480,WITHERED LEAVES.,as he wished to lay down. As she did so she perceived the blood was
4481,WITHERED LEAVES.,settled under his nails. He flung himself on the bed; concealing his
4482,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hands under his back; his breathing became difficult, and death soon"
4483,WITHERED LEAVES.,claimed him for his own.
4484,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4485,WITHERED LEAVES.,Sorrow filled the afflicted household when the intelligence reached
4486,WITHERED LEAVES.,"them. The father saw the messenger approaching, and informed the"
4487,WITHERED LEAVES.,family the son was coming.
4488,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4489,WITHERED LEAVES.,A younger sister and brother were lingering in the last stages of
4490,WITHERED LEAVES.,consumption. They were now filled with eager expectancy. The father
4491,WITHERED LEAVES.,"soon discovered the horse, but not the rider they were expecting, and"
4492,WITHERED LEAVES.,waited the issue with fearful forebodings.
4493,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4494,WITHERED LEAVES.,Loud was the burst of grief that rung the air when the stricken family
4495,WITHERED LEAVES.,heard of the death of the absent one in so unexpected a moment; thus
4496,WITHERED LEAVES.,crushing out forever the hope that had sprung up in so many hearts of
4497,WITHERED LEAVES.,returning health and usefulness.
4498,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4499,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Upon a post mortem examination, it was discovered that the rupture of"
4500,WITHERED LEAVES.,a blood vessel was the cause of his death. His lungs were found to
4501,WITHERED LEAVES.,"be in a bad condition, betraying that the foe of the family had been"
4502,WITHERED LEAVES.,holding secret revel there.
4503,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4504,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A day or two later, and the sable plumed angel returned again, and"
4505,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hovered over the gentle sister, casting his shadow upon her brow, and"
4506,WITHERED LEAVES.,chilling her with his icy breath. His snowy fingers rested upon her
4507,WITHERED LEAVES.,fluttering pulses; she cast one fond gaze upon the dear brother that
4508,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was soon to follow her, bade farewell to her earthly friends, and went"
4509,WITHERED LEAVES.,with the angel to the spirit land.
4510,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4511,WITHERED LEAVES.,The brother lingered till the remains of his sister were laid in
4512,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the grave, then he followed her, to add another to the long row of"
4513,WITHERED LEAVES.,headstones that marked the resting place of that stricken family. They
4514,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sleep together, side by side, ten in number, the oldest one scarce"
4515,WITHERED LEAVES.,twenty-two years old. As we stand by the spot and read the melancholy
4516,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tale, we can but exclaim with Ossian, ""The flower lifts its green head"
4517,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to the sun. Why dost thou awake me, O gale,"" it seems to say, ""I am"
4518,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wet with the dews of heaven."" ""The time of my fading is near, and the"
4519,WITHERED LEAVES.,"blast that shall scatter my leaves."" ""To-morrow shall the traveler"
4520,WITHERED LEAVES.,come; he that saw me in my glory shall come; his eye shall search the
4521,WITHERED LEAVES.,"field for me but shall not find me."""
4522,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4523,WITHERED LEAVES.,A youth of great promise next presents; his mother had many years
4524,WITHERED LEAVES.,"since fallen a prey to the fatal disease, and although he inherited"
4525,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from her the fearful malady, ""the young disease that must subdue"
4526,WITHERED LEAVES.,"at length,"" had not as yet developed itself. Buoyant with hope and"
4527,WITHERED LEAVES.,"expectation, he was preparing to enter the gospel ministry, having"
4528,WITHERED LEAVES.,consecrated himself to God and his service. He had entered the
4529,WITHERED LEAVES.,"institution at North Yarmouth, and by his assiduous attention, almost"
4530,WITHERED LEAVES.,finished his education. He was expecting soon to launch out upon the
4531,WITHERED LEAVES.,"broad ocean of public usefulness, but his heavenly Father bid him"
4532,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""come up higher,"" and he passed on into the more expansive ocean of"
4533,WITHERED LEAVES.,eternity. The seeds of an inherent disease sprung up and bore early
4534,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fruit, and deposited this young man in his grave, far from the home"
4535,WITHERED LEAVES.,and the friends of his childhood. The eye of the stranger rests upon
4536,WITHERED LEAVES.,"it, the foot of the stranger visits it."
4537,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4538,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A younger sister too, fell by the same powerful agent far from home,"
4539,WITHERED LEAVES.,and is buried in a land of strangers. A brother sleeps by his mother's
4540,WITHERED LEAVES.,side in the family burial ground.
4541,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4542,WITHERED LEAVES.,In another family the mother was called first from a family of little
4543,WITHERED LEAVES.,"children. She wept in the agonies of death, as she contemplated their"
4544,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bereavement. She pressed to her heart the infant of a few days, and"
4545,WITHERED LEAVES.,"prayed fervently to that God that heareth prayer, to be the God of her"
4546,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dear children, to protect them in their tender age, and lead them in"
4547,WITHERED LEAVES.,the narrow way that leads to eternal life. After the sands of life had
4548,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ebbed out, and her loving heart had ceased to feel, the tear-drops"
4549,WITHERED LEAVES.,that had fallen for her children still lingered upon her cheeks.
4550,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4551,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A lovely daughter followed her at the early age of sixteen, another"
4552,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ere she reached the meridian of life, leaving seven children. Another"
4553,WITHERED LEAVES.,daughter passed away just as her sun was verging toward the western
4554,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hemisphere, leaving a son and daughter. The son soon followed her and"
4555,WITHERED LEAVES.,was laid by the side of his mother and grandmother.
4556,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4557,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The crimson spot upon the daughter's cheek, accompanied by the hacking"
4558,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cough, seem to denote that the tardy messenger will soon bear another"
4559,WITHERED LEAVES.,victim to the mansions of death. Another daughter too is lingering
4560,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the confines of the grave, while the fatal seeds are taking"
4561,WITHERED LEAVES.,"deep root in the constitutions of two of the sons, and heralding by"
4562,WITHERED LEAVES.,unmistakable evidence the approach of death.
4563,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4564,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But why particularize? Many, very many who have walked with us side"
4565,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by side, in the sweet associations of life, are mingled with the long"
4566,WITHERED LEAVES.,"train that are buried beneath the ""clods of the valley,"" while there"
4567,WITHERED LEAVES.,is a long train of living victims marching before the fearful blight
4568,WITHERED LEAVES.,to the open tomb.
4569,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4570,WITHERED LEAVES.,No monarch sways his despotic sceptre over so numerous a population as
4571,WITHERED LEAVES.,"this fell destroyer, in his unseen lurking places, ""drinking up the"
4572,WITHERED LEAVES.,"very fountains of human life."" But when will the sons of men learn to"
4573,WITHERED LEAVES.,"think? with all the blight of death around, cutting one down upon the"
4574,WITHERED LEAVES.,"right hand and another upon the left, the thoughtless crowd pass on,"
4575,WITHERED LEAVES.,little seeming to heed their own mortality. They look into the open
4576,WITHERED LEAVES.,"grave, or watch the passing funeral perhaps with a momentary sadness,"
4577,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and turns lightly again to the active concerns of life, mingling in"
4578,WITHERED LEAVES.,"its gaities and dissipation, dancing on to the very whirlpool that is"
4579,WITHERED LEAVES.,"soon to engulf their frail bark, and bear it away where hope can never"
4580,WITHERED LEAVES.,come.
4581,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4582,WITHERED LEAVES.,Happy they who receive instruction from the revelations of God's holy
4583,WITHERED LEAVES.,"word, and imbibe its precepts into their heart; who, cleansed in a"
4584,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Saviour's blood, are made recipients of his rich grace, and are thus"

4713,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4714,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The clouds hung in heavy dense masses, during the day, while a damp"
4715,WITHERED LEAVES.,chilly wind from the north-east betokened an uncomfortable winter

4725,WITHERED LEAVES.,"or smoked his pipe of peace. Here, where now stands the temple of the"

4727,WITHERED LEAVES.,"blood of some poor victim, as it was offered upon the altar of savage"

4734,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4735,WITHERED LEAVES.,"On the banks of that stream, where the pale face first crossed to hold"

4738,WITHERED LEAVES.,industry of its virtuous and well disposed inhabitants. It would be
4739,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pleasant to tell a tale of the times of old, of the deeds of the days"
4740,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of other years, of the Indian that paddled his light canoe upon our"
4741,WITHERED LEAVES.,river; but this is not the purport of the story.
4742,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4743,WITHERED LEAVES.,It is to scan the different scenes as they lay spread out before
4744,WITHERED LEAVES.,"us, upon the map of busy life. The day had closed, dark, dreary and"
4745,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cheerless. The rain and sleet were driven furiously before the wind,"
4746,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and the child of want shrank from the biting blast, as stern necessity"
4747,WITHERED LEAVES.,drove him forth to meet the peltings of the winter storm.
4748,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4749,WITHERED LEAVES.,"There was a social gathering at a large, elegantly finished and"
4750,WITHERED LEAVES.,"furnished hall, splendidly illuminated with its brilliant gas lights,"
4751,WITHERED LEAVES.,diffusing a lustre upon gorgeous trappings with which they were
4752,WITHERED LEAVES.,surmounted.
4753,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4754,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The streets resounded with the rattling wheels of omnibusses, cabs and"
4755,WITHERED LEAVES.,"various vehicles, as they bore the gay and fashionable part of the"

4757,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4758,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Soft music charmed the ear, and floated in sweet melody through the"

4760,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Fashion displayed her most tasteful arrangements, and each one seemed"
4761,WITHERED LEAVES.,vieing with the other in elegance of costume. All looked like the
4762,WITHERED LEAVES.,"enchanting scenes pictured in fairy tales, and one might almost"
4763,WITHERED LEAVES.,"suppose Alladin's wonderful lamp was still extant, performing its"
4764,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mysterious spells, and casting a supernatural lustre over the gay"
4765,WITHERED LEAVES.,"group that assembled, to dissipate the cheerless gloom that reigned"
4766,WITHERED LEAVES.,"without, by mirth and hilarity. And they joined in the mazy dance, and"
4767,WITHERED LEAVES.,spent the hours of night in joyous revelry. A sumptuous entertainment
4768,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was prepared, and everything provided to satisfy the votaries of"
4769,WITHERED LEAVES.,pleasure.
4770,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4771,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But as the lively music sounded from that splendid hall, it stole upon"

4778,WITHERED LEAVES.,"life with them many years), wrapped in the shroud of death, and next"
4779,WITHERED LEAVES.,"day to be borne away to the tomb, and shut out forever from all the"
4780,WITHERED LEAVES.,scenes where she had once been an actress. But now she would look out
4781,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the world no more. Her eyes were closed in death, and her ear"
4782,WITHERED LEAVES.,heard not the wild music that was stealing through her otherwise
4783,WITHERED LEAVES.,silent chamber.
4784,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4785,WITHERED LEAVES.,"All of earth had passed from her vision. Life, with its stern, cold"
4786,WITHERED LEAVES.,"realities, or its light toned revelry, could awaken no response in her"
4787,WITHERED LEAVES.,inanimate form.
4788,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4789,WITHERED LEAVES.,A brother had been summoned from a distant village to attend her
4790,WITHERED LEAVES.,"funeral. He had travelled, notwithstanding the inclemency of the"
4791,WITHERED LEAVES.,"weather, and when the shades of twilight fell over the earth, he stood"
4792,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by that dearly loved form. Memory brought back the past. That cold,"
4793,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pulseless one was a child again, sporting by his side, prattling upon"
4794,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his knee, and winning attention by the ten thousand witcheries of"
4795,WITHERED LEAVES.,childhood.
4796,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4797,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then, with the rapidity of thought, blooming youth succeeded this age,"
4798,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and she stood, blushing in maiden modesty, the gay young sister of"
4799,WITHERED LEAVES.,other days; and his heart was filled with sadness as he gazed upon her
4800,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stiff in the icy arms of death, and felt that she could no more return"
4801,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his affection. He was an aged man, and knew much of the sorrow and"
4802,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the trials of life; he turned, with a tear in his eye, from his loved"
4803,WITHERED LEAVES.,sister and passed into the street.
4804,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4805,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The storm was increasing, but he heeded not the peltings of the wintry"
4806,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wind, or the wild music that mingled with its mournful wail, as he"
4807,WITHERED LEAVES.,"passed the luxurious hall, where"
4808,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4809,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Fashion's gay tapers were lighted."""
4810,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4811,WITHERED LEAVES.,Other thoughts occupied his mind.
4812,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4813,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He soon stood by the bedside of a dear daughter, who was passing away"
4814,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from earth, while yet in the bloom and the beauty of youth. She was a"
4815,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wife, and a mother of two sweet children, whose tender age required a"
4816,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mother's watchfulness--a mother's care. But with childlike trust, she"
4817,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had given them back to that God, who had given them to her. Her trust"
4818,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was in him, and now she was ready to follow her dear Saviour into the"
4819,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cold dark grave, with the assurance that she should have a part in the"
4820,WITHERED LEAVES.,first resurrection. Melancholy sounded the music from that distant
4821,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ball room, as it stole upon the wings of the winter wind, into the"
4822,WITHERED LEAVES.,chamber of the dying one. Her ear was listening to catch the notes
4823,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of angel harps before the throne of God, and her passing spirit was"
4824,WITHERED LEAVES.,attuned to their melodies. The beauties of the upper world transfixed
4825,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her rapt vision, and no earthly object stood between her soul and God."
4826,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And so she passed away, and left to her earthly friends but the frail"
4827,WITHERED LEAVES.,"casket, while the priceless jewel had soared to brighter regions, to"
4828,WITHERED LEAVES.,glitter in a Saviour's crown.
4829,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4830,WITHERED LEAVES.,The father had come just in time to take the last look of his living
4831,WITHERED LEAVES.,"child, to hear her last words, to witness her last struggle, as the"
4832,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pure spirit departed from earth, to join her sainted mother in the"
4833,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spirit land. He was taking another portion from the cup of affliction,"
4834,WITHERED LEAVES.,"which however bitter to the taste, often sweetens the journey of human"
4835,WITHERED LEAVES.,"life, preparing the recipient better to perform its duties, and bear"
4836,WITHERED LEAVES.,its trials.
4837,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4838,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As the stricken father retired to bed, the sound of revelry fell"
4839,WITHERED LEAVES.,heavily upon an almost bursting heart.
4840,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4841,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And the dear children, could they listen to its glad strain? O, no;"
4842,WITHERED LEAVES.,they had seen death cast his marble paleness upon their mother's face;
4843,WITHERED LEAVES.,had felt the icy coldness of her pulseness limbs; had called her by
4844,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the endearing name of mother, and her pale lips answered not, and they"
4845,WITHERED LEAVES.,had retired with eyes red with weeping; they as yet knew nothing
4846,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the extent of their bereavement. The husband, too, had lost the"
4847,WITHERED LEAVES.,"companion of his youth, the mother of his children, and although he"
4848,WITHERED LEAVES.,"possessed like precious faith with her, and kissed the rod with pious"
4849,WITHERED LEAVES.,"resignation; still they were a grief-stricken household, and presented"
4850,WITHERED LEAVES.,a striking contrast to the gay group that were dancing thoughtlessly
4851,WITHERED LEAVES.,"away the hours of that solemn night, while the recording angel was"
4852,WITHERED LEAVES.,"taking note of all that was passing beneath his all-seeing eye, in"
4853,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that book that shall be opened when we shall all stand before God, to"
4854,WITHERED LEAVES.,be judged according to the deeds done in the body.
4855,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4856,WITHERED LEAVES.,The music floated on and reached the ear of a poor maniac as he sat by
4857,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his comfortable fire, listening to the monotonous roar of the distant"
4858,WITHERED LEAVES.,"water fall, and the howling of the wintry winds, as it came surging"
4859,WITHERED LEAVES.,"on, waving the leafless tree and pelting the falling rain against the"
4860,WITHERED LEAVES.,windows.
4861,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4862,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Hark!"" said he, springing up, ""the bees are swarming; I shall be"
4863,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stung to death,"" and out he rushed, with a brighter fire in his eye"
4864,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and a more intense one in his brain. Descending the hill, he watched"
4865,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the sylph like forms as they floated on in the mazy dance, declaring"
4866,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the bees were in terrible commotion, and he should be stung to death."
4867,WITHERED LEAVES.,"With difficulty he was prevailed upon to return to his house, and ever"
4868,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and anon, as the sound of the music reached his ear, he would start"
4869,WITHERED LEAVES.,and affirm that the bees surely were swarming.
4870,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4871,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Such is man, the noblest work of God, when bereft of reason to guide"
4872,WITHERED LEAVES.,and direct him.
4873,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4874,WITHERED LEAVES.,Still farther on were young parents keeping anxious watch over a sick
4875,WITHERED LEAVES.,"infant, whose feeble thread of life seemed trembling upon a very hair."
4876,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The doctor had said there was no hope; kind, sympathizing friends, as"
4877,WITHERED LEAVES.,"they looked on the sufferings of the dear babe with tearful eyes, had"
4878,WITHERED LEAVES.,"said, there is no hope; and the agonized hearts of the parents echoed"
4879,WITHERED LEAVES.,"back, no hope. But still they did hope. The breath came heavily from"
4880,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the heaving chest, and the blue orbs looked dimly from their half"
4881,WITHERED LEAVES.,"closed lids, while the little sufferer, with burning hand and parched"
4882,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lip, seemed struggling for that life that it had enjoyed but for so"
4883,WITHERED LEAVES.,brief a space. The parents were young in years and unacquainted with
4884,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sorrow, and very dear to their loving hearts was the sick infant. They"
4885,WITHERED LEAVES.,felt they could not part with the dear one. Carefully they nursed the
4886,WITHERED LEAVES.,"flickering lamp of life: through that dreary winter night, lest some"
4887,WITHERED LEAVES.,ruder blast should extinguish it forever. Wished they to join the
4888,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thoughtless throng in the tinselled hall of fashion? O, no, they had"
4889,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rather count the fluttering pulses of their dear boy, cool his fevered"
4890,WITHERED LEAVES.,"brow, and administer the reviving cordial through the weary hours of"
4891,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the night, than to listen to sweetest strains of Orpheus' harp, or"
4892,WITHERED LEAVES.,thread the winding mazes of the giddy dance.
4893,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4894,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And so with them the night wore away, the long dark night of suffering"
4895,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to the babe, and watchful anxiety to the parents. But the angel of"
4896,WITHERED LEAVES.,"death that had hovered so long over the darling babe, unfurled his"
4897,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sable pinions and flew away in search of another victim, and he is"
4898,WITHERED LEAVES.,spared yet a little longer.
4899,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4900,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Pursuing the way a little farther in another direction, you find"
4901,WITHERED LEAVES.,"another weary watcher by the midnight lamp. An aged woman, who has"
4902,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lived her three score years and ten, sits bolstered up in her chair,"
4903,WITHERED LEAVES.,"toiling for her little remaining sum of existence, which nature seems"
4904,WITHERED LEAVES.,"unwilling to relinquish, although subsisting now upon borrowed time."
4905,WITHERED LEAVES.,"From an adjoining room comes a frequent hollow cough, and the sunken"
4906,WITHERED LEAVES.,"eye and emaciated frame of the poor girl betray the secret foe,"
4907,WITHERED LEAVES.,lurking in the hidden springs of life.
4908,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4909,WITHERED LEAVES.,Death is no stranger beneath this roof. He has borne away one after
4910,WITHERED LEAVES.,"another from this numerous household, and laid them down side by side"
4911,WITHERED LEAVES.,in the silent grave. And now his darts seem aimed at the two only ones
4912,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of that household, the mother and her daughter. The sons are married"
4913,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and have families of their own, but the mother and this daughter live"
4914,WITHERED LEAVES.,"alone in the home of her youth, the very place, perchance, where she"
4915,WITHERED LEAVES.,was brought a gay and expecting bride by that husband she is expecting
4916,WITHERED LEAVES.,now to follow so soon to the spirit world. Could the pleasures or the
4917,WITHERED LEAVES.,"gaities of the world cast one cheering beam upon their lonely home? O,"
4918,WITHERED LEAVES.,"no, the religion of Jesus alone can illuminate their benighted hearts,"
4919,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and in ""this light they see light,"" and feel prepared to go when the"
4920,WITHERED LEAVES.,summons comes.
4921,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4922,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Following the street, you pass the door of a daughter who is weeping"
4923,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for the recent loss of a mother, who passes suddenly away without"
4924,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a moment's warning, and a widow who mourns a husband, cut off by"
4925,WITHERED LEAVES.,lingering disease.
4926,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4927,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A few steps and we reach a cottage, where other parents were watching"
4928,WITHERED LEAVES.,"over a little son of five years, who is wasting away with consumption."
4929,WITHERED LEAVES.,"His attenuated limbs bear his little frame but feebly, and he often"
4930,WITHERED LEAVES.,"talks of death, for he has recently seen a little sister younger than"
4931,WITHERED LEAVES.,himself fall a prey to the fearful malady. A burning fever is raging
4932,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in his veins, and lights up his eye with unwonted brilliancy, as he"
4933,WITHERED LEAVES.,tossed restlessly from side to side upon his pillow. His silken hair
4934,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of beautiful brown is brushed smoothly back from his high, marble"
4935,WITHERED LEAVES.,"forehead, while gentle hands apply the cooling bath, to still if"
4936,WITHERED LEAVES.,"possible, its tumultuous throbbings, and he murmurs of sweet sister"
4937,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and of heaven. Soft words of love are whispered in his ear, and he is"
4938,WITHERED LEAVES.,told of the Lamb of God that bids little children to come unto him.
4939,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4940,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And thought not these weary watchers of that lonely night, of the"
4941,WITHERED LEAVES.,revellers in that distant hall? Methinks their hearts went up in
4942,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fervent prayer to God that he would spare them yet a little longer,"
4943,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for there were immortal souls there, for whom he labored and prayed,"
4944,WITHERED LEAVES.,who entered the sanctuary and heard the word of God as it fell from
4945,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his lips, Sabbath after Sabbath, and he felt sensibly that the"
4946,WITHERED LEAVES.,"midnight revel would not prepare the heart to seek God, or make the"
4947,WITHERED LEAVES.,necessary preparation for death. Towards morning the eyes of the
4948,WITHERED LEAVES.,"little sufferer closed in uneasy slumber, and the parents too, were"
4949,WITHERED LEAVES.,refreshed by a short interval of sleep.
4950,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4951,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Passing yet in another direction was a tall youth, with a subdued"
4952,WITHERED LEAVES.,"expression of countenance, hurrying on, in spite of wind and rain, to"
4953,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the doctor's office, to procure assistance for a sick mother, who was"
4954,WITHERED LEAVES.,tossing in all the agony of brain fever. The doctor had been called
4955,WITHERED LEAVES.,"away to visit a little child that had a sudden attack of the croup,"
4956,WITHERED LEAVES.,that fearful disease that bears so many children to the tomb. He
4957,WITHERED LEAVES.,returned again with a sorrowing heart. Heeded he the sweet tones of
4958,WITHERED LEAVES.,music that fell upon his youthful ear? wished he to join the gay group
4959,WITHERED LEAVES.,"as they flitted before the brilliantly lighted, window, and the fairy"
4960,WITHERED LEAVES.,"forms of the fashionable, and the pleasure-seeking met his eye? O,"
4961,WITHERED LEAVES.,"no; there was sorrow in his young heart, and sorrow brooded over the"
4962,WITHERED LEAVES.,"household. Towards midnight the doctor came, and a young daughter,"
4963,WITHERED LEAVES.,"younger than many who graced the festive ball, following his"
4964,WITHERED LEAVES.,"directions, alleviated the sufferings of a sick mother, and wore the"
4965,WITHERED LEAVES.,weary night away in anxious watchings.
4966,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4967,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Not till another day dawned, did the rumbling of the carriages cease,"
4968,WITHERED LEAVES.,that were conveying home the sons and daughters of dissipation. And
4969,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thus passed the night, leaving no trace upon earth, for the waves of"
4970,WITHERED LEAVES.,time have obliterated all its footprints. But its record is on
4971,WITHERED LEAVES.,"high, and it will never be forgotten by the Eternal One, whose eye"
4972,WITHERED LEAVES.,slumbereth not.
4973,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4974,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Such is human life, and such is the race of man. Although we are all"
4975,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bound together by one common brotherhood, the song of the gay is ever"
4976,WITHERED LEAVES.,the funeral dirge to the sorrowing.
4977,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4978,WITHERED LEAVES.,Perchance that night might have disclosed still darker pictures in
4979,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the hidden recesses of our village, for, oh, there are dens of foul"
4980,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pollution, that send their infectious taint over the pure air of"
4981,WITHERED LEAVES.,"our community, calling the blush of shame to the cheek of conscious"
4982,WITHERED LEAVES.,"virtue, and creating an ardent desire in the breast of the"
4983,WITHERED LEAVES.,"philanthropist, to go forth and labor in the vineyard of the Lord,"
4984,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that these foul spots may be washed in his precious blood, and made"
4985,WITHERED LEAVES.,clean.
4986,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4987,WITHERED LEAVES.,"O, could all the misery that was extant in the village have been"
4988,WITHERED LEAVES.,"presented to the thoughtless revellers, could they have danced on?"
4989,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Would not the tear of sympathy have moistened the cheek, and the still"
4990,WITHERED LEAVES.,"small voice whispered of a solemn time that must come to them? O, it"
4991,WITHERED LEAVES.,"is wise to receive the admonition, ""Be ye also ready, for in such an"
4992,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh."""
4993,WITHERED LEAVES.,
4994,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Faint, indeed, are the delineations from Memory's tablet, upon this"
4995,WITHERED LEAVES.,"little map, but enough, perchance, to lead the contemplative mind to"
4996,WITHERED LEAVES.,"reflect upon the vicissitudes and changes of its little day, and teach"
4997,WITHERED LEAVES.,"us to prepare for a better world, ""where change comes not."""

5123,WITHERED LEAVES.,A Scene on the Kennebec River.
5124,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5125,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5126,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was a beautiful morning in early June, and nature was dressed in"
5127,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her beautiful robes of pale green, as the leaves had not yet assumed"
5128,WITHERED LEAVES.,that deeper hue that the mature rays of a summer sun impart to them.
5129,WITHERED LEAVES.,No cloud floated over the blue vault of heaven. The golden sun
5130,WITHERED LEAVES.,"diffused a radiant light, and shed a sparkling lustre upon the deep,"
5131,WITHERED LEAVES.,"black water of the mighty river, that rolled on in gentle undulating"
5132,WITHERED LEAVES.,"waves, as it was tossed lightly by the sighing breeze that floated"
5133,WITHERED LEAVES.,over its surface.
5134,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5135,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Far as the eye could scan were seen the snowy sails, as the mariners"
5136,WITHERED LEAVES.,pursued their way over the black bosom of the waters to enter the
5137,WITHERED LEAVES.,"briny Atlantic, that received the waters of the rolling river and"
5138,WITHERED LEAVES.,mingled them with its own foaming wave. The smaller sail boats were
5139,WITHERED LEAVES.,"flying before the wind, while innumerable ships lay at rest in the"
5140,WITHERED LEAVES.,"harbor, with snowy sails unfurled, while the rough cry of the sailors"
5141,WITHERED LEAVES.,broke boisterously upon the morning air.
5142,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5143,WITHERED LEAVES.,"At the wharf, before the flourishing village that lay reposing on the"
5144,WITHERED LEAVES.,"banks of the river, lay a ferry-boat, impatient to launch away upon"
5145,WITHERED LEAVES.,the restless waters.
5146,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5147,WITHERED LEAVES.,There was hurry and bustle as the time for the boat's departure had
5148,WITHERED LEAVES.,"arrive, and many wished to be borne to the opposite shore."
5149,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5150,WITHERED LEAVES.,Among the rest came a gay group of laughing school girls. Their joyous
5151,WITHERED LEAVES.,"faces were lit up with bright smiles, and they were chatting gaily of"
5152,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the afternoon's party, and the anticipated evening's walk, heedless"
5153,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the care worn man of business that shuffled in by their side, or"
5154,WITHERED LEAVES.,prudent ladies who looked upon the gay party as pert or presuming.
5155,WITHERED LEAVES.,"They were, many of them, the children of wealth, and waved in their"
5156,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hands rich boquets of beautiful and rare exotics, while others were"
5157,WITHERED LEAVES.,equally satisfied with more simple flowers. They advanced to the head
5158,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the boat, and stood with their hands placed upon its edge, looking"
5159,WITHERED LEAVES.,over into the deep waters. One beautiful form attracted the attention
5160,WITHERED LEAVES.,of all who looked upon her. Her form was slight and delicate. Her
5161,WITHERED LEAVES.,"complexion was transparent, but a slight tinge of pink rested upon"
5162,WITHERED LEAVES.,her cheek. Her azure eyes beamed with a sweet expression from their
5163,WITHERED LEAVES.,"soul-lit depths, while her dark brown hair floated in heavy masses of"
5164,WITHERED LEAVES.,"glossy curls over her ivory neck and shoulders, waving gently in the"
5165,WITHERED LEAVES.,"morning breeze, as it floated lightly around her. She was dressed in a"
5166,WITHERED LEAVES.,"simple white robe, and in her hand held the richest boquet. Her snowy"
5167,WITHERED LEAVES.,"arms were bare almost to the shoulder, and as she stood looking"
5168,WITHERED LEAVES.,"out upon the far off sail, or watching the entrance of her fellow"
5169,WITHERED LEAVES.,"passengers, as they took their respective places in the boat; no eye"
5170,WITHERED LEAVES.,that looked upon her but lingered in its gaze to admire her beauty.
5171,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5172,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then came a rich man and his lady, and there must be room in the boat"
5173,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for their splendid equipage, and so his gay horse stood champing his"
5174,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bitts and curbing his proud head, as his fiery eyes glanced over the"
5175,WITHERED LEAVES.,glassy surface of the restless waters.
5176,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5177,WITHERED LEAVES.,"All was ready, the signal was given, and the boat ploughed her way"
5178,WITHERED LEAVES.,"like a thing of life, leaving a long path of white foam in her wake."
5179,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5180,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Men talked of business, of the prospect of the advancing season, the"
5181,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pressure in the money market, or the perfidy of the opposing political"
5182,WITHERED LEAVES.,party.
5183,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5184,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Women talked about their cross children, unfaithful servants, and"
5185,WITHERED LEAVES.,various domestic trials.
5186,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5187,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The young girls talked of their school, their boquets, and the many"
5188,WITHERED LEAVES.,"little events in which they were interested, while a group of school"
5189,WITHERED LEAVES.,"boys, who had entered last, and were obliged to stand in the rear of"
5190,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the boat, declared they had never seen the fair queen of that party"
5191,WITHERED LEAVES.,looking so lovely.
5192,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5193,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But suddenly there was a jar, a scream, a plunge, and that fairy form"
5194,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was precipitated into the foaming waters beneath, and the boat was"
5195,WITHERED LEAVES.,gliding on with such rapidity that no arm could reach her. She sank
5196,WITHERED LEAVES.,"slowly from sight, as her spreading robe buoyed her up for a moment on"
5197,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the waves. Her long curls lay spread out, tossing upon the surface"
5198,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by the motion of the waves, then as they sank slowly from sight,"
5199,WITHERED LEAVES.,"one snowy hand was raised, clutching the boquet with a tenacity so"
5200,WITHERED LEAVES.,proverbial to the drowning. She then sank to sleep beneath the surging
5201,WITHERED LEAVES.,waves that danced lightly on over her death cold bosom.
5202,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5203,WITHERED LEAVES.,"None could tell exactly how the accident happened. The horse, unused"
5204,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to that mode of conveyance, became restive, and in his plungings to"
5205,WITHERED LEAVES.,"liberate himself precipitated the unfortunate girl, with all her gay"
5206,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dreams of life and pleasure, into a watery grave."
5207,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5208,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The tide was going out, and she fell into the rapid current, and when"
5209,WITHERED LEAVES.,her body was recovered no traces of beauty rested upon her marble
5210,WITHERED LEAVES.,"features, and none who looked upon the black, bloated face and lips"
5211,WITHERED LEAVES.,of the poor girl could recognize the bright beauty of that joyous
5212,WITHERED LEAVES.,"morning. The withered boquet was covered with green slime, and like"
5213,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the hand that held it, bore no resemblance to its former self. ""Surely"

5340,WITHERED LEAVES.,A Long Night in the Eighteenth Century.
5341,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5342,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5343,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The hardy and enterprising inhabitants, who first penetrated the"
5344,WITHERED LEAVES.,"eastern forests, to fell their hardy oaks, and build up settlements,"
5345,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in the then remote east, had many difficulties to encounter, which"
5346,WITHERED LEAVES.,later generations know nothing of. In the latter part of the
5347,WITHERED LEAVES.,"eighteenth century, two families lived in their log cabins, in the"
5348,WITHERED LEAVES.,"interior of the forest. They had each a small cleared spot of land,"
5349,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that amply repaid their labor, by its rich productions. The morning"
5350,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sun, as he shed his rising beams over the long range of forest trees,"
5351,WITHERED LEAVES.,"glanced smilingly upon their little cultivated spot,"
5352,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5353,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""That bloomed like Eden, in the world's first spring;"""
5354,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5355,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and they were contented and happy. The dense forest trees, waving"
5356,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in the blast, or gently bowing their lofty heads before the milder"
5357,WITHERED LEAVES.,"breeze, made music not unlike the dash of Ocean on his winding shore."
5358,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5359,WITHERED LEAVES.,"They were far from the abodes of men. The fashions, the vanities and"
5360,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the pleasures of life, held no despotic sway in their breasts. They"
5361,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pursued ""the even tenor of their ways,"" rising before the sun, and"
5362,WITHERED LEAVES.,retiring almost with his sinking beams.
5363,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5364,WITHERED LEAVES.,The cows and sheep went forth to crop the green herbage and luxurious
5365,WITHERED LEAVES.,"grass, heralding their approach by tinkling bells."
5366,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5367,WITHERED LEAVES.,"No roads were made, and the citizens pursued their way by trees,"
5368,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stripped of little pieces of bark, by friendly Indians, who went"
5369,WITHERED LEAVES.,"as guides to the pale faces, that had come into their territories,"
5370,WITHERED LEAVES.,"purchased their lands, and distributed the deadly fire-water among"
5371,WITHERED LEAVES.,"them, thus adding fury to their already ferocious natures."
5372,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5373,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The men were both house carpenters, and one of them a wheelwright; so"
5374,WITHERED LEAVES.,"they were frequently called upon to leave their homes, and go to some"
5375,WITHERED LEAVES.,"distant part, where a new settlement was springing up, to fill the"
5376,WITHERED LEAVES.,"place of the forest trees, that had fallen before the woodman's axe."
5377,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5378,WITHERED LEAVES.,"In the spring of 1773, the settlement upon the banks of the Kennebec"
5379,WITHERED LEAVES.,"river, now called Gardiner (but then bearing the Indian name of"
5380,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Cobbessy), was progressing rapidly. A saw mill was to be erected upon"
5381,WITHERED LEAVES.,"this rapid stream, that had rolled on for centuries, through the"
5382,WITHERED LEAVES.,"towering forest, only bearing the Indian's light canoe, as it floated"
5383,WITHERED LEAVES.,"over its glassy surface, and the dipping of the paddle, in the dark"
5384,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rolling stream, awoke an answering echo in her wild forest haunts."
5385,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5386,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And so these men, Mr. Fuller and Capt. Somers, shouldered their tools,"
5387,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and pursued their way by the spotted trees, to the far off settlement,"
5388,WITHERED LEAVES.,"leaving their families in the bosom of the forest, unprotected and"
5389,WITHERED LEAVES.,alone. Not infrequently did the crackling brush denote the near
5390,WITHERED LEAVES.,"approach of the sulky bear, or some other wild beast that had"
5391,WITHERED LEAVES.,"heretofore roamed the woods at large, undisturbed, save by the"
5392,WITHERED LEAVES.,"swift-winged arrow of the Indian, as he pursued his prey over the"
5393,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dense forest, but little tamer than the hunted beast. A discharge"
5394,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the rifle, which they were ever obliged to carry with them, soon"
5395,WITHERED LEAVES.,"caused the enemy to retreat, and leave them to pursue their solitary"
5396,WITHERED LEAVES.,walk unmolested.
5397,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5398,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Often would the Indians come along in droves, their small dogs"
5399,WITHERED LEAVES.,indicating their approach. The chief of one tribe was called Sousup.
5400,WITHERED LEAVES.,"His wife was a woman of pleasant countenance, and was usually very"
5401,WITHERED LEAVES.,"neatly dressed, having her blanket of snowy whiteness, while her"
5402,WITHERED LEAVES.,"moccasins were of the nicest material. She was covered with wampum,"
5403,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and wore large jewels in her ears and nose, and large silver brooches"
5404,WITHERED LEAVES.,"on different parts of her dress. She never drank the fire-water, and"
5405,WITHERED LEAVES.,"used to trade with the pale faces, as she was so gentle in her manners"
5406,WITHERED LEAVES.,that she easily won her way into their houses and hearts.
5407,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5408,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was sunset, when Mrs. Fuller had milked her cows, and performed the"
5409,WITHERED LEAVES.,domestic duties that devolved upon her during her husband's absence.
5410,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She had laid her sleeping infant from her arms, and her other children"
5411,WITHERED LEAVES.,"were placed snugly in bed, when she was startled by seeing an Indian's"
5412,WITHERED LEAVES.,dog emerging from a clump of bushes that stood a few yards from the
5413,WITHERED LEAVES.,"house, and come bounding towards the door."
5414,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5415,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Her heart palpitated violently, for frequent reports reached their"
5416,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ears, of whole families falling a fearful prey to savage brutality."
5417,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Soon she heard the Indian dialect vociferated in loud voices, while"
5418,WITHERED LEAVES.,"occasionally a loud savage yell rang fearfully through the air,"
5419,WITHERED LEAVES.,"blending a wild chorus with the strains of the warbling birds, as they"
5420,WITHERED LEAVES.,"carolled their vesper hymns upon the neighboring branches, before"
5421,WITHERED LEAVES.,"retiring to their nests. Hastily she closed her doors, and skulked"
5422,WITHERED LEAVES.,"away in a secret corner, hoping they would pass on, and not disturb"
5423,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her. She soon became aware, by their fierce words, that there were"
5424,WITHERED LEAVES.,many of them in a state of intoxication.
5425,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5426,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The heart of the lonely woman almost died within her, as she heard"
5427,WITHERED LEAVES.,their heavy tramp before the door. She had taken the precaution to
5428,WITHERED LEAVES.,"draw in the leather string that was attached to the wooden latch, to"
5429,WITHERED LEAVES.,"raise it, thus betraying her own secret. After pounding upon the door"
5430,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for some time, and threatening to break it down if it was not opened,"
5431,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the storm subsided, and she hoped, by the sound of retreating"
5432,WITHERED LEAVES.,"footsteps, they were pursuing their journey."
5433,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5434,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She was soon undeceived, by hearing her own name called, by the gentle"
5435,WITHERED LEAVES.,"voice of Sousup's wife, or ""squaw,"" as he called her."
5436,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5437,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She stepped forward and opened the door, and discovered a large horde"
5438,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of red men, wrapped in dirty blankets, reeling under the influence of"
5439,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the fire-water. The squaws were in a squalid condition, and equally"
5440,WITHERED LEAVES.,"drunk with the men, while the papooses, that were placed in sacks upon"
5441,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their backs, peeping up, with their bare heads and dirty faces, added"
5442,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to the wretchedness of the scene, and the sight of them blanched the"
5443,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cheek of the poor woman, as she tremblingly looked upon them."
5444,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5445,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Dove Eye marked her fear, and informed her, in broken English, that"
5446,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the Penobscot tribe had joined with them, and they were going towards"
5447,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the rising sun, to hunt moose and deer, and make mats and baskets, to"
5448,WITHERED LEAVES.,carry to Boston.
5449,WITHERED LEAVES.,

5452,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5453,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She told her they were going to have a pow-wow, and wished to go into"
5454,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a little cleared spot, in the edge of the forest, near her dwelling."
5455,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mrs. Fuller dared not refuse, and so she tremblingly consented."
5456,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5457,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She told her tribe the result of their confab, and they came forward,"
5458,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to a man, and laid down their rifles, tomahawks and scalping knives at"
5459,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her feet, saying,"
5460,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5461,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Me no hurt white squaw."""
5462,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5463,WITHERED LEAVES.,"They collected a large pile of brush, kindled their fire, lit their"
5464,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pipes, and prepared their evening meal, after which they commenced"
5465,WITHERED LEAVES.,their savage revelry.
5466,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5467,WITHERED LEAVES.,"They daubed their faces with red paint, while their greasy black hair"
5468,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hung in dishevelled masses down their backs, and waved to and fro as"
5469,WITHERED LEAVES.,"they jumped or ran, and performed the various evolutions of their mazy"
5470,WITHERED LEAVES.,dance.
5471,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5472,WITHERED LEAVES.,Mrs. Fuller lit no candle during that fearful night. She watched their
5473,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dusky forms, as they flitted by, dimly seen through the trees, by the"
5474,WITHERED LEAVES.,"glaring blaze of the fire, that crackled up, throwing a flickering"
5475,WITHERED LEAVES.,light upon the majestic forest trees that waved in solemn grandeur
5476,WITHERED LEAVES.,"above their heads, and sighed mournfully as the night winds floated"
5477,WITHERED LEAVES.,"among their branches. The Indians formed a circle round the fire, by"
5478,WITHERED LEAVES.,"joining hands, and their frantic gestures were teriffic to behold, and"
5479,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their wild shrieks rent the air. Twice, and twice only, the fearful"
5480,WITHERED LEAVES.,"war-whoop resounded, filling the heart of that lonely watcher with"
5481,WITHERED LEAVES.,indescribable fear.
5482,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5483,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was past midnight; the moon had passed her zenith in the sky,"
5484,WITHERED LEAVES.,and the swarthy band seemed frantic with their wild orgies and
5485,WITHERED LEAVES.,intoxication.
5486,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5487,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Many had fallen, beastly drunk, while others swayed like the forest"

5489,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5490,WITHERED LEAVES.,Dove Eye sat on a mossy rock looking upon the scene with a melancholy
5491,WITHERED LEAVES.,expression of countenance. Near her lay stretched upon the bare
5492,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ground, Eagle Eye, the wife of the swarthy chief, who had joined their"
5493,WITHERED LEAVES.,tribe in their hunting excursions.
5494,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5495,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Suddenly a furious din arose, and it was evident that anger was added"
5496,WITHERED LEAVES.,to the other debasing passions that were holding control over their
5497,WITHERED LEAVES.,"benighted souls. Furious was the strife of words, and fearful menaces"
5498,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and threats fell from brutal, savage lips."
5499,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5500,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Suddenly the stranger chief seized a burning torch, and accompanied by"
5501,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a fierce looking companion, strode hastily toward the house. Dove Eye"
5502,WITHERED LEAVES.,"saw their movements and sprang hurriedly to their side, endeavoring"
5503,WITHERED LEAVES.,to stop their progress; but they pushed her aside and proceeded. Mrs.
5504,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Fuller, too, saw them through the small pane of glass that was placed"
5505,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in her board window, and hope almost forsook her. They passed on: the"
5506,WITHERED LEAVES.,light gleamed through the pane and flickered upon the face of her
5507,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sleeping infant. She heard distinctly their voices in low, guttural"
5508,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tones, and their heavy tread fell painfully upon her ear. They passed"
5509,WITHERED LEAVES.,"round the corner of the house, and she lost sight and sound of them."
5510,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She opened the door into an adjoining apartment, and the light burst"
5511,WITHERED LEAVES.,upon her with such intense brightness that she thought at first they
5512,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had fired the house. Upon approaching the window, she again discovered"
5513,WITHERED LEAVES.,"them by the wood pile searching for the axe, which they soon raised,"
5514,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and cutting several sticks of wood, bore it away to replenish their"
5515,WITHERED LEAVES.,fire.
5516,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5517,WITHERED LEAVES.,"In a short time their dusky forms wrapped in their dirty blankets,"
5518,WITHERED LEAVES.,"were stretched upon the damp ground, with their greasy heads turned"
5519,WITHERED LEAVES.,"towards the fire, and sleep descended upon their weary lids, and"
5520,WITHERED LEAVES.,silence once more reigned round that forest home.
5521,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5522,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Dove Eye still reclined upon the rock, watching the moon as it hid"
5523,WITHERED LEAVES.,"its silver beams behind a dark mountain, whose eternal summit lay"
5524,WITHERED LEAVES.,stretched along the western horizon.
5525,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5526,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mrs. Fuller, too, kept anxious watch. She knew from many of them she"
5527,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had nothing to fear; they had often warmed themselves by her fire,"
5528,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had eaten of her bread, and in many ways been partakers of her"
5529,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hospitality, and she knew the Indian never forgets a kindness."
5530,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5531,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She gently hushed the feeble wailings of her infant, lest it should"
5532,WITHERED LEAVES.,awaken them to savage rage. She almost resolved to take her children
5533,WITHERED LEAVES.,and leave the house while that savage band were weighed down by sleep
5534,WITHERED LEAVES.,and intoxication. But she feared it might exasperate them if they
5535,WITHERED LEAVES.,"found her gone, and so she waited the event, lifting her heart to God"
5536,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in prayer, for he was the refuge of that christian woman, in every"
5537,WITHERED LEAVES.,hour of trial.
5538,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5539,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The sun came up at length, and shed his glorious beams over the face"
5540,WITHERED LEAVES.,of rejoicing nature. The birds sang their matin hymns of praise. The
5541,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dew drops glittered upon the green grass and tender herbage, and the"
5542,WITHERED LEAVES.,"restless cows lowed, impatient to wander forth at their accustomed"
5543,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hour. The children arose, refreshed by their slumber, and as they"
5544,WITHERED LEAVES.,"looked out upon the dusky sons of the forest, their hearts quaked"
5545,WITHERED LEAVES.,"within them, and stealing silently into a corner, they awaited their"
5546,WITHERED LEAVES.,fate with pale faces.
5547,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5548,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Dove Eye stole quietly from the rock, and kindling the almost"
5549,WITHERED LEAVES.,"extinguished fire, hastily prepared their simple morning meal. She"
5550,WITHERED LEAVES.,"took from a deer skin knapsack, which she carried upon her back, a"
5551,WITHERED LEAVES.,"neat white cloth, and repaired to the house of Mrs. Fuller, wishing"
5552,WITHERED LEAVES.,to exchange some nice dried moose meat for some new milk. Mrs. Fuller
5553,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hastily milked, and filling a large pail, Dove Eye bore it to their"
5554,WITHERED LEAVES.,"place of rendezvous, and the cows went forth to crop the dewy grass."
5555,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5556,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She then awoke her husband, and soon the dusky group were partaking of"
5557,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their morning repast, with evident satisfaction, after which they made"
5558,WITHERED LEAVES.,"preparations to depart. They came, one after another, to get their"
5559,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hunting utensils and their implements of war, from Mrs. Fuller,"
5560,WITHERED LEAVES.,"telling her,"
5561,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5562,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Me no forget white squaw--me bring moose meat for white squaw."""
5563,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5564,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Soon they marched away, in Indian file, and as their dusky forms"
5565,WITHERED LEAVES.,"disappeared, one after another, behind the forest trees, her heart"
5566,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rose in thanksgiving to God, for her preservation. Dove Eye lingered"
5567,WITHERED LEAVES.,till the rest of her tribe vanished from sight; there was sadness in
5568,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her countenance, and sadness in her voice, as she said,"
5569,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5570,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Dove Eye see white squaw no more. Dove Eye go toward the rising sun,"
5571,WITHERED LEAVES.,"but Dove Eye come no more."""
5572,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5573,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mrs. Fuller pressed her hand affectionately, and commending her to the"
5574,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Great Spirit, she departed to overtake her companions. The children"
5575,WITHERED LEAVES.,"emerged from their hiding places, a cheerful fire burned upon the"
5576,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hearth, and the weary mother prepared the morning meal for herself and"
5577,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her children, with a grateful heart."
5578,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5579,WITHERED LEAVES.,"When the wandering tribe returned again towards the setting sun, Dove"
5580,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Eye was not with them--she had ""gone to the land where her fathers had"
5581,WITHERED LEAVES.,"gone."""
5582,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5583,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Years passed on--years of trial, of anxiety, and of change. The tall"
5584,WITHERED LEAVES.,forest trees gave place to cultivated fields and blooming orchards.
5585,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5586,WITHERED LEAVES.,Roads traversed the vast country in every direction. Numerous villages
5587,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rose up, on the flourishing banks of the winding Kennebec, and its"
5588,WITHERED LEAVES.,proud waters bore many a whitened sail upon its surface.
5589,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5590,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The red men of the forest have passed away, like the withered leaves"
5591,WITHERED LEAVES.,"before the autumnal gale, and the wild bear and deer are now strangers"
5592,WITHERED LEAVES.,in their secluded haunts.
5593,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5594,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The young wife and mother passed from the sober matron to mature age,"
5595,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and there were deep furrows upon her cheek, and the frosts of many"
5596,WITHERED LEAVES.,winters whitened her hair; but when she related the events of that
5597,WITHERED LEAVES.,"night to her grand-children, or great-grand-children, she ever spoke"
5598,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with trembling voice, and called it the ""long fearful night."""

5685,WITHERED LEAVES.,Henriette Clinton;

5689,WITHERED LEAVES.,Reverses of Fortune.
5690,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5691,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5692,WITHERED LEAVES.,At the foot of the Alleghany Mountains stands the flourishing village
5693,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of Hollidaysburg. On the banks of the blue Juniata, that winds on till"
5694,WITHERED LEAVES.,"it buries its waters in the rolling Susquehannah, stood the elegant"
5695,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mansion of Esquire Clinton, the village lawyer. He had lost his young"
5696,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wife many years since, and Henriette, his only child, shared largely"
5697,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in the affection of her father. Her every wish was gratified, and she"
5698,WITHERED LEAVES.,was educated in the fashionable etiquette of the place. She was the
5699,WITHERED LEAVES.,"guiding star in the fashionable circle in which she moved, and a"
5700,WITHERED LEAVES.,general favorite.
5701,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5702,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But there came a change. The father was seized with sudden illness,"
5703,WITHERED LEAVES.,and in a few short hours was no more. The grief-stricken Henriette
5704,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had watched with an agonized heart the progress of the disease, had"
5705,WITHERED LEAVES.,"attended to his wants, and supplied his necessities with her own"
5706,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hands. A skillful physician had done all that medical aid could do,"
5707,WITHERED LEAVES.,"but nothing could avail. The grim messenger lingered not, and the"
5708,WITHERED LEAVES.,beautiful Henriette was left sole mistress of the splendid mansion.
5709,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5710,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But Frederic Clinton had made preparation for that event, and his lamp"
5711,WITHERED LEAVES.,was trimmed and burning when the Master came.
5712,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5713,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Henriette, too, had given her heart to God, while the freshness of"
5714,WITHERED LEAVES.,"youth was yet upon it, and now he supported her in her hour of trial."
5715,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Her father was borne to the grave, with all the splendor of wealth, a"
5716,WITHERED LEAVES.,"long train of sympathizing friends following in the procession, and"
5717,WITHERED LEAVES.,"showing every attention to the bereaved orphan, who was the only"
5718,WITHERED LEAVES.,mourner.
5719,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5720,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Henriette returned with an aching heart, to the home of her childhood,"
5721,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and seated herself in her father's library, overwhelmed with grief."
5722,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5723,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was a cheerless autumn day, and nature seemed sympathizing in her"
5724,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sorrow. The fitful gusts of wind came sighing down the mountains, and"
5725,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sweeping over the usually placid waters of the Juniata, tossed its"
5726,WITHERED LEAVES.,"waves into tumultuous motion, and drove it more rapidly on in its"
5727,WITHERED LEAVES.,serpentine course. The beautiful magnolia that stood before the
5728,WITHERED LEAVES.,"window, was filled with its second crop of yellow flowers, that were"
5729,WITHERED LEAVES.,"faded and ready to pass away, and the surging blasts swept them"
5730,WITHERED LEAVES.,"unceremoniously from the branches, as it came sighing down the"
5731,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mountains, and sweeping along the valley. The sun had long since hid"
5732,WITHERED LEAVES.,"himself behind the summit of the eternal hills, that she had loved to"
5733,WITHERED LEAVES.,"watch with her father, from that window, while learning lessons"
5734,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from his lips, of the grandeur and sublimity of God, who spake that"
5735,WITHERED LEAVES.,stupendous chain of mountains into existence. And her thought was
5736,WITHERED LEAVES.,"turned to that God, who has promised to be ""the father of the"
5737,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fatherless."" To him she knelt--to him she prayed. Soothed and"
5738,WITHERED LEAVES.,"comforted, she arose and entered the parlor. Sympathizing domestics"
5739,WITHERED LEAVES.,"awaited her pleasure, and obeyed her commands."
5740,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5741,WITHERED LEAVES.,Proper measures were taken for an investigation of Mr. Clinton's
5742,WITHERED LEAVES.,"affairs, and the estate was pronounced insolvent, and all was offered"
5743,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for sale. At first Henriette could scarcely believe the assertion, but"
5744,WITHERED LEAVES.,"when she became convinced of its truth, she nerved her mind to meet"
5745,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the trial, relying upon that God ""who tempers the wind to the shorn"
5746,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lamb."""
5747,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5748,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She immediately dismissed her domestics, who had been faithful so"
5749,WITHERED LEAVES.,"long to the family, watching over their young mistress, during her"
5750,WITHERED LEAVES.,"childhood and early youth, and now they felt grieved to leave her. She"
5751,WITHERED LEAVES.,"gave each one a present from her own treasures, procured good places"
5752,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for them, retaining only the dear old nurse in her service, for a few"
5753,WITHERED LEAVES.,"days, till the auction had taken place."
5754,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5755,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Henriette had never been accustomed to labor, and old Mary was"
5756,WITHERED LEAVES.,"surprised upon seeing her enter the dining room, with her glossy brown"
5757,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hair parted neatly over her high marble forehead, clad in a simple"
5758,WITHERED LEAVES.,"gingham, which she had prepared for a morning dress, with a brown"
5759,WITHERED LEAVES.,"linen apron, to assist her in making the necessary arrangements for"
5760,WITHERED LEAVES.,her removal and the coming sale.
5761,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5762,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The rooms were put in the best possible order, and the luxurious"
5763,WITHERED LEAVES.,"furniture arranged with great care, that everything might show to the"
5764,WITHERED LEAVES.,"best advantage. She selected a few choice volumes from the library,"
5765,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and placed them in a large trunk, which was to contain her own"
5766,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wardrobe, and which she had decided upon keeping, if circumstances"
5767,WITHERED LEAVES.,would permit.
5768,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5769,WITHERED LEAVES.,This had been her favorite room; one window looked out upon the
5770,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mountains, that lifted their heads in majestic grandeur, and seemed"
5771,WITHERED LEAVES.,"supporting the very clouds upon their lofty summits, while their"
5772,WITHERED LEAVES.,jagged sides looked as though they would drop upon the valley below.
5773,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But they had stood for ages the same, braving the fury of the wintry"
5774,WITHERED LEAVES.,"storm as its surging blasts swept over them, or parched by the burning"
5775,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rays of the noonday sun, as he poured his fierce scorching beams upon"
5776,WITHERED LEAVES.,"them. She had looked upon them too in the twilight hour, when the"
5777,WITHERED LEAVES.,"coming darkness would present strange, mysterious shadows, and the"
5778,WITHERED LEAVES.,"craggy rocks would assume the forms of men, and fancy would conjure up"
5779,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a lawless band of midnight plunderers emerging from their dark caves,"
5780,WITHERED LEAVES.,upon the mountain side.
5781,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5782,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But now she was looking out of that window perhaps for the last time,"
5783,WITHERED LEAVES.,and the unbidden tear would spring to her eye. The books were nicely
5784,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dusted, the comfortable stuffed rocking chair stood in its usual place"
5785,WITHERED LEAVES.,"where her father used to love to sit so well, and a splendid ottoman"
5786,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stood before it, which was usually her seat. Her elegant little chair"
5787,WITHERED LEAVES.,"covered with crimson velvet, stood by the window, where she ever loved"
5788,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to linger to look out upon the mountains, always finding some new"
5789,WITHERED LEAVES.,"trace of beauty, as she gazed upon their cloud capped summits. But now"
5790,WITHERED LEAVES.,she must linger no longer; the rich covering was placed exactly square
5791,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the elegant little table, and every particle of dust was banished"
5792,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from the room, and there were duties elsewhere that demanded her"
5793,WITHERED LEAVES.,"attention. As she turned to leave the room, she raised her eyes to the"
5794,WITHERED LEAVES.,"portraits of her parents that hung suspended on the wall opposite her,"
5795,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in heavy gilt frames. The likenesses were very natural, and now seemed"
5796,WITHERED LEAVES.,smiling upon her with life-like affection. At this time the man
5797,WITHERED LEAVES.,"entered with whom she had procured board, and who had kindly offered"
5798,WITHERED LEAVES.,to assist in removing any articles she might wish to convey to his
5799,WITHERED LEAVES.,house. The dear resemblances of her idolized parents were removed
5800,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from the spot they had occupied so many years, to be carried to a"
5801,WITHERED LEAVES.,stranger's home. Henriette felt less regret at parting from the place
5802,WITHERED LEAVES.,now those loved faces were removed. There were many little treasures
5803,WITHERED LEAVES.,"associated with dear memories she would gladly have taken, but a"
5804,WITHERED LEAVES.,"strict sense of honor forbade her. She turned away, locking the door,"
5805,WITHERED LEAVES.,"but leaving the key in it, to be turned next by a stranger's hand. She"
5806,WITHERED LEAVES.,"drew up her music stool, and seating herself upon it touched the keys"
5807,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of her piano with a skillful hand, and sang with a trembling voice,"
5808,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5809,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Farewell, farewell, is a lonely sound."""
5810,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5811,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She closed the instrument as she finished the pieced saying,"
5812,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5813,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""It is the last time."""
5814,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5815,WITHERED LEAVES.,"There was one hour before the auction, and already were curious eyes"
5816,WITHERED LEAVES.,"peering round the premises. Every thing being arranged to their minds,"
5817,WITHERED LEAVES.,Henriette dismissed the dear old nurse with many tears and a generous
5818,WITHERED LEAVES.,"reward. She would live near by and would see her every day, and this"
5819,WITHERED LEAVES.,was a source of great comfort to both.
5820,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5821,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Henriette now ran down the beautiful terraced walk, through her"
5822,WITHERED LEAVES.,"father's garden, till she reached a beautiful arbor on the brink of"
5823,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the river, where she had spent so many happy hours. Here was her"
5824,WITHERED LEAVES.,"guitar, her father's flute, and the book they had last read together."
5825,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She seated herself upon the richly cushioned seat, and looked upon"
5826,WITHERED LEAVES.,the winding waters that seemed mocking her sad heart as they danced
5827,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sparkling on beneath the mellow rays of the autumnal sun, its bosom"
5828,WITHERED LEAVES.,ruffled by the autumnal breeze. At the foot of the terrace her fairy
5829,WITHERED LEAVES.,"skiff lay moored, which used to dance upon the wave by moonlight,"
5830,WITHERED LEAVES.,while she and her father made the air resound with the melody of their
5831,WITHERED LEAVES.,music; but there was little time to linger here.
5832,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5833,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She put the little arbor in order, and repaired next to her"
5834,WITHERED LEAVES.,"conservatory, filled with rich and rare exotics, took a hasty glance,"
5835,WITHERED LEAVES.,moving the choice plants into the position that best suited her good
5836,WITHERED LEAVES.,"taste, and wiping the dust from its polished shelves. Her father's"
5837,WITHERED LEAVES.,chair occupied its place by his favorite window that looked out upon
5838,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the Juniata that was indistinctly seen, peeping its little spots of"
5839,WITHERED LEAVES.,blue through the thick leaves of the plants that almost hid it from
5840,WITHERED LEAVES.,"view. She took a last look, passing on to the aviary, where a choice"
5841,WITHERED LEAVES.,collection of birds filled the ear with their melody. Old nurse had
5842,WITHERED LEAVES.,"attended to this department, and she caressed her pets, and smoothed"
5843,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their feathers, and breathing a sad adieu, turned to take a last look"
5844,WITHERED LEAVES.,"at her favorite Sullensifadda, as she had named her noble steed. She"
5845,WITHERED LEAVES.,"patted his neck, told him coaxingly he would never again climb the"
5846,WITHERED LEAVES.,mountain pass with her upon his back; took a last look of her father's
5847,WITHERED LEAVES.,"splendid saddle horse of dapple grey, and his jet black span of"
5848,WITHERED LEAVES.,"carriage horses, and passed round through the richly cultivated"
5849,WITHERED LEAVES.,"grounds, and gardens where every thing that wealth could procure lay"
5850,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spread out before the eye. She took a hasty look, a hasty leave of all"
5851,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and felt that sense of desolation known to almost every human heart,"
5852,WITHERED LEAVES.,when called upon to part from dear familiar objects. She looked at her
5853,WITHERED LEAVES.,"elegant gold watch, and finding her time had expired, returned to"
5854,WITHERED LEAVES.,the house. Already there had many arrived who wished to attend the
5855,WITHERED LEAVES.,"auction. Henriette entered a small apartment, seated herself upon a"
5856,WITHERED LEAVES.,"low stool, and wept as she heard the unfeeling remarks and low jests,"
5857,WITHERED LEAVES.,"as the vulgar crowd pulled about the furniture, turning it from side"
5858,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to side, declaring they had no idea Esq. Clinton's mansion was so"
5859,WITHERED LEAVES.,meanly furnished. But we will not dwell upon this painful scene.
5860,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5861,WITHERED LEAVES.,Mr. Charles Norcross purchased the house with all its appurtenances.
5862,WITHERED LEAVES.,The furniture was distributed about here and there among the
5863,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wealthy citizens, who wished to add some article of luxury to their"
5864,WITHERED LEAVES.,"establishment. And all was gone. Sold for less than half its value,"
5865,WITHERED LEAVES.,and poor Henriette had the mortification of hearing that the debts
5866,WITHERED LEAVES.,"were not cancelled. So she disposed of her gold watch and pencil, her"
5867,WITHERED LEAVES.,"father's watch, a box of rich jewelry, and every available article in"
5868,WITHERED LEAVES.,her possession to contribute her mite to keep dishonor from resting
5869,WITHERED LEAVES.,upon her father's name. She then went forth penniless upon the world.
5870,WITHERED LEAVES.,But there was a light in her eye and firmness in her step that told of
5871,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a ""will to do, a soul to dare."" She had been educated in the customs"
5872,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the village, and had been an aristocrat. Now she had another lesson"
5873,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to learn, a sad lesson speaking of the depravity of the human heart,"
5874,WITHERED LEAVES.,and now she must learn all the cold heartlessness of that world that
5875,WITHERED LEAVES.,had heretofore shone so brightly upon her pathway. She did not once
5876,WITHERED LEAVES.,think in her grief that her change in fortune would make any change in
5877,WITHERED LEAVES.,"friendship's tone, but alas! the society in which she had moved was"
5878,WITHERED LEAVES.,"very, very exclusive, and to labor with the hands was to bar the door"
5879,WITHERED LEAVES.,of that society forever against one.
5880,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5881,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Henriette at first did not realize this, and when she met her former"
5882,WITHERED LEAVES.,"gay companions, was surprised when they passed her with an averted"
5883,WITHERED LEAVES.,"eye, or a slight nod of recognition. Frequently was she called upon to"
5884,WITHERED LEAVES.,"meet that sudden death chill that falls so often upon the human heart,"
5885,WITHERED LEAVES.,when the fond affections of many years gush warmly up to the eye and
5886,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lip, as we meet some long cherished friend who passes us by with a"
5887,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cold, scornful glance. O this is poverty's bitterest curse, and this"
5888,WITHERED LEAVES.,too must be met. Those who might have removed many a sharp thorn from
5889,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the pathway of the lonely Henriette, but added sharpness to their"
5890,WITHERED LEAVES.,"point, and made her feel and deeply feel,"
5891,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5892,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Man's inhumanity to man,"
5893,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Makes countless thousands mourn."""
5894,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5895,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The poor girl felt there was no time to sit still, for she was a"
5896,WITHERED LEAVES.,"destitute orphan, and she must try to help herself, and so she"
5897,WITHERED LEAVES.,"repaired to Mrs. Cobb, the most fashionable dress maker in the"
5898,WITHERED LEAVES.,"village, to see if she could learn her trade."
5899,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5900,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Matters were satisfactorily arranged, and she commenced immediately."
5901,WITHERED LEAVES.,A willing hand and active mind made the task easier than she had
5902,WITHERED LEAVES.,anticipated. It was soon a matter of conversation through all the
5903,WITHERED LEAVES.,"village, when it became known that the haughty Henriette Clinton was"
5904,WITHERED LEAVES.,"going to be a dress maker, and many were the remarks that were made"
5905,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon her everlasting gingham dress, for her nice sense of propriety"
5906,WITHERED LEAVES.,prevented her from wearing the rich articles of apparel contained in
5907,WITHERED LEAVES.,her wardrobe; and at present she could procure no other. She formed
5908,WITHERED LEAVES.,the resolution sometimes of disposing of some of her costly garments
5909,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to relieve her present necessity, but they had been selected by her"
5910,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dear father, and were all that remained to her as a link of her past"
5911,WITHERED LEAVES.,"intercourse with him, and so she clung to them as dear remembrances of"
5912,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the past, the happy past."
5913,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5914,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She sat through the long weary hours with her eyes bent upon her work,"
5915,WITHERED LEAVES.,and made rapid proficiency in the art she was acquiring.
5916,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5917,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mr. Norcross, who purchased the Clinton estate, was a man of a low"
5918,WITHERED LEAVES.,sordid mind not at all calculated to appreciate the elegance of his
5919,WITHERED LEAVES.,"domicile. He was a merchant, and had rapidly come into possession of"
5920,WITHERED LEAVES.,"great wealth, and wishing to climb a little higher upon the ladder"
5921,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of aristocracy, he thought a purchase of the lawyer's splendid"
5922,WITHERED LEAVES.,"establishment would forward his progress. Therefore, selling his own"
5923,WITHERED LEAVES.,"place at a very high price, and purchasing that at an equally low one,"
5924,WITHERED LEAVES.,did not much diminish his hoarded gold. But after all they were not
5925,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the Clintons. It was only Mr. Norcross the store-keeper, and they had"
5926,WITHERED LEAVES.,many steps to climb before they could reach that position in society
5927,WITHERED LEAVES.,"they were so desirous of attaining. They bowed to one, scraped to"
5928,WITHERED LEAVES.,"another, parties were made, and many means devised, all of which were"
5929,WITHERED LEAVES.,"accompanied with disappointment, as the least desired would come, and"
5930,WITHERED LEAVES.,those for whom the party was made would just as surely stay away.
5931,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5932,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mrs. Norcross was a large coarse woman, with red hair, light blue"
5933,WITHERED LEAVES.,"eyes, and freckled face, but with a good humored expression of"
5934,WITHERED LEAVES.,"countenance. Her two daughters, Araminta and Clarinda, were not very"
5935,WITHERED LEAVES.,"refined in their manners, owing to a deficiency in their education,"
5936,WITHERED LEAVES.,"but were good hearted, cheerful girls. Araminta was much pleased with"
5937,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Henriette's horse, but did not appreciate the name, and declared he"
5938,WITHERED LEAVES.,"should be called Selim, for she knew she had read of some great"
5939,WITHERED LEAVES.,"man who had a horse by that name, and who ever heard of one named"
5940,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Sullensifadda, ugly name. She mounted him one day, gaily caparisoned,"
5941,WITHERED LEAVES.,"but he being equally unaccostomed to his new name and rider, soon"
5942,WITHERED LEAVES.,convinced her he had a light pair of heels.
5943,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5944,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Henriette sat busily at work by the window, when the clatter of the"
5945,WITHERED LEAVES.,"well known hoofs sounded upon her ear, and she raised her eyes just in"
5946,WITHERED LEAVES.,time to see her well remembered steed flying toward the mountain
5947,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pass with the speed of lightning, while the frightened Araminta was"
5948,WITHERED LEAVES.,"clinging to his mane to prevent falling to the ground, her long riding"
5949,WITHERED LEAVES.,dress and veil were streaming behind her their full length in the
5950,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wind, which was blowing pretty briskly, and her small riding-cap was"
5951,WITHERED LEAVES.,drawn a little farther upon one side than the rules of gentility
5952,WITHERED LEAVES.,"seemed to require. Henriette pitied the poor girl, but she could not"
5953,WITHERED LEAVES.,help smiling at her ludicrous appearance. She turned pale when she
5954,WITHERED LEAVES.,"saw the horse turn suddenly down a narrow path that led to the river,"
5955,WITHERED LEAVES.,"plunge into its dashing waves, and swimming round a circuitous route,"
5956,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spring back upon the shore, and setting his face towards home, bore"
5957,WITHERED LEAVES.,back the mortified girl all wet and dripping through the streets at
5958,WITHERED LEAVES.,"too rapid a rate for any one to interfere with his arrangements,"
5959,WITHERED LEAVES.,arriving at home apparently well satisfied with his performance.
5960,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5961,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Months passed away, such months as Henriette had never known before."
5962,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She could have borne her toil, her simple fare, and the ten thousand"
5963,WITHERED LEAVES.,"deprivations she was subjected to, had this been all; but the averted"
5964,WITHERED LEAVES.,looks of her friends were more than all these. She used to sit a
5965,WITHERED LEAVES.,"little while in the twilight hour upon her parents' graves, and recall"
5966,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their loved forms and tender words, and people her imagination with"
5967,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by-gone scenes, and then, as she contrasted the present, her cherished"
5968,WITHERED LEAVES.,"text would come to illuminate her mind and calm her troubled spirit,"
5969,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""all things work together for good to them that fear God,"" and she was"
5970,WITHERED LEAVES.,"comforted and strengthened to go on her weary way, for this took in"
5971,WITHERED LEAVES.,"life with all its little incidents, its every day trials, and she"
5972,WITHERED LEAVES.,"returned to the active duties of life, realizing that ""this is not our"
5973,WITHERED LEAVES.,"home."""
5974,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5975,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Ere the spring returned she had accomplished her wish, and entered"
5976,WITHERED LEAVES.,into many families as dress maker where she used to be admitted as an
5977,WITHERED LEAVES.,"equal, if not superior. She maintained her dignity of deportment, for"
5978,WITHERED LEAVES.,"now she well knew poverty did not deteriorate from worth, a"
5979,WITHERED LEAVES.,lesson perhaps she too might have been slow to learn under some
5980,WITHERED LEAVES.,"circumstances, but which now had been taught her by stern necessity,"
5981,WITHERED LEAVES.,and her rigid lessons are never soon forgotten.
5982,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5983,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She had taken the rich trimming from some of her plainest dresses, and"
5984,WITHERED LEAVES.,wore them when she could not possibly avoid it. She did her work with
5985,WITHERED LEAVES.,"great neatness and dispatch, and was supplied with all she could"
5986,WITHERED LEAVES.,"possibly do, so that she remunerated the kind hearted woman who had"
5987,WITHERED LEAVES.,"boarded her through her apprenticeship, and been very attentive to her"
5988,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in many ways, for she truly pitied the poor orphan."
5989,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5990,WITHERED LEAVES.,In the spring Mr. Clinton's vacant office was again occupied by a
5991,WITHERED LEAVES.,"young lawyer, who came into the village, from New York, named Henry"
5992,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Lorton, and half the young ladies' heads were turned, by the beauty"
5993,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and elegance of the young northerner. Parties were formed, walks"
5994,WITHERED LEAVES.,"projected up the mountains, moonlight sails upon the silvery bosom of"
5995,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the Juniata, and every means devised to draw the young lawyer into"
5996,WITHERED LEAVES.,"company, and love with the southern beauties; but they declared his"
5997,WITHERED LEAVES.,heart was as cold as the region he came from.
5998,WITHERED LEAVES.,
5999,WITHERED LEAVES.,"All these things Henriette heard, as she sat plying her needle, or"
6000,WITHERED LEAVES.,stood fitting a dress to the forms of some of her gay companions;
6001,WITHERED LEAVES.,"but now her interests were separate from theirs, and she toiled on,"
6002,WITHERED LEAVES.,"through the weary day. There were some who appreciated her motives,"
6003,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and spoke kindly to the poor orphan, and the sweet consciousness of"
6004,WITHERED LEAVES.,well doing sweetened her cup of toil.
6005,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6006,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Henry Lorton was educated upon liberal New England principles, and"
6007,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his mother was a dress-maker before her marriage with his father, and"
6008,WITHERED LEAVES.,"besides, he had ever been taught to respect the industrious part"
6009,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the community, and his high minded principles revolted from the"
6010,WITHERED LEAVES.,"overbearing aristocracy of the place, and therefore, he appeared"
6011,WITHERED LEAVES.,reserved to those with whom he associated.
6012,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6013,WITHERED LEAVES.,Henriette felt grieved as she visited her father's grave; there was no
6014,WITHERED LEAVES.,"monument erected at his head, while at her mother's stood an elegant"
6015,WITHERED LEAVES.,"polished marble one, of great value, having a female bearing an infant"
6016,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in her arms, chiselled upon it, and this one thought occupied her"
6017,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mind; she would rise early and eat the bread of carefulness, might she"
6018,WITHERED LEAVES.,but erect a monument to her father's grave; and often she burned the
6019,WITHERED LEAVES.,"midnight lamp, and rose before the stars had faded from the sky, to"
6020,WITHERED LEAVES.,accomplish her holy purpose.
6021,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6022,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A young lady, who was married about that time, saw and wished to"
6023,WITHERED LEAVES.,"purchase an elegantly trimmed satin dress, and Henriette assented,"
6024,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thinking the value of it would be more sacred to her eyes, in her"
6025,WITHERED LEAVES.,"father's monument, than elsewhere. The young lady paid her the full"
6026,WITHERED LEAVES.,"value of this and several other articles of clothing, and she soon had"
6027,WITHERED LEAVES.,the pleasure of seeing the splendid monument reared over her father's
6028,WITHERED LEAVES.,grave.
6029,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6030,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Ellen Horton had ever met Henriette with a cordial greeting, and she"
6031,WITHERED LEAVES.,did not feel the same shrinking when she was requested to spend a few
6032,WITHERED LEAVES.,days at the residence of the wealthy Edward Horton that she did in
6033,WITHERED LEAVES.,"going to many other places, and she went with a cheerful heart to"
6034,WITHERED LEAVES.,prepare the splendid bridal dress for Ellen.
6035,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6036,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Next day, Charles Hunter, the future bridegroom, arrived from"
6037,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Providence, the future home of the fair Ellen, and the young ladies"
6038,WITHERED LEAVES.,and gentlemen of the place were invited to spend the evening.
6039,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6040,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mr. Horton was formerly from Philadelphia, and an intimate friend of"
6041,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Charles Hunter's father, who was a sea captain, and being shipwrecked"
6042,WITHERED LEAVES.,"during one of his voyages, was conveyed in a pitiful condition to the"
6043,WITHERED LEAVES.,"house of Mr. Horton, and thus commenced an ardent friendship, to be"
6044,WITHERED LEAVES.,ended only by death.
6045,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6046,WITHERED LEAVES.,The nuptials of Charles and Ellen were looked forward to with great
6047,WITHERED LEAVES.,"interest, by both families. Especially, was Mrs. Hunter, much pleased,"
6048,WITHERED LEAVES.,"as she was an invalid, and had no daughter."
6049,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6050,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But evening came--bright, beautiful evening, and with it came bright,"
6051,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beautiful eyes--bright, beautiful faces, and all was gaiety and"
6052,WITHERED LEAVES.,"joyousness, In the brilliantly illuminated parlors of Mr. Horton."
6053,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Henriette, yielding to the wishes of Ellen and her mother, and the"
6054,WITHERED LEAVES.,"express commands of Mr. Horton, consented to join the party. She"
6055,WITHERED LEAVES.,entered the room with the dignity of a queen; but the scornful toss
6056,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of many a young head, and the averted gaze of many a familiar eye,"
6057,WITHERED LEAVES.,"brought the deep blush of wounded feelings to her cheek, ere she"
6058,WITHERED LEAVES.,reached her seat. As she raised her eyes she met those of Henry Lorton
6059,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fixed upon her, with an expression that her woman's intuitive sense"
6060,WITHERED LEAVES.,easily read.
6061,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6062,WITHERED LEAVES.,"They had frequently met before, but had never formed any acquaintance."
6063,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6064,WITHERED LEAVES.,Each one was winning a name. Henry Lorton had made rapid advancement
6065,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in his profession, and stood high in the estimation of his fellow men,"
6066,WITHERED LEAVES.,for honesty and integrity of principle.
6067,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6068,WITHERED LEAVES.,Many a match-making mother would gladly have entrapped him for her
6069,WITHERED LEAVES.,"daughter, and many a daughter, perchance, might have accepted his"
6070,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hand, had it been offered, but it was not. No one could elicit"
6071,WITHERED LEAVES.,anything beyond politeness from him.
6072,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6073,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He turned to a dark-eyed beauty, who sat beside him, asking her if she"
6074,WITHERED LEAVES.,was acquainted with Miss Clinton.
6075,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6076,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She blushed, stammered,"
6077,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6078,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Why, no; I am not now--that is, I used to be when she went into"
6079,WITHERED LEAVES.,"society, that is before her father's death--before she was a"
6080,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dress-maker."""
6081,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6082,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Henry turned away, disgusted with this indefinite intelligence. For"
6083,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a moment a slight smile of scorn rested upon his lip, and a darker"
6084,WITHERED LEAVES.,expression shaded his countenance; but it lingered not. The usual
6085,WITHERED LEAVES.,"happy smile returned again, and holy charity came back to his heart."
6086,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6087,WITHERED LEAVES.,The evening passed sadly to Henriette. She was with her dear
6088,WITHERED LEAVES.,"schoolmates--the friends of her early days, and her heart yearned for"
6089,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the dear familiar tones that then fell upon her ear, and in spite of"
6090,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her every effort, the tear trickled down her cheek. She turned to the"
6091,WITHERED LEAVES.,"window, and looked out upon the blue waters and the grey sides of the"
6092,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lofty mountain, that seemed looking down upon her in sympathy, like"
6093,WITHERED LEAVES.,the Mighty Power that created it.
6094,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6095,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She was roused from her reverie by the voice of Ellen, who presented"
6096,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mr. Lorton, he having earnestly solicited an introduction. They"
6097,WITHERED LEAVES.,"conversed pleasantly upon the beauties of the surrounding scenery, and"
6098,WITHERED LEAVES.,before the party broke up he requested permission to visit her at her
6099,WITHERED LEAVES.,"boarding house, the next evening."
6100,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6101,WITHERED LEAVES.,"There were some sly glances, but it was the independent Henry Lorton,"
6102,WITHERED LEAVES.,and little was said.
6103,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6104,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The next evening he visited Henriette, offered her his heart and hand,"
6105,WITHERED LEAVES.,and was accepted. They appointed an early day for the wedding. Henry
6106,WITHERED LEAVES.,"adding,"
6107,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6108,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""We will give the people an agreeable surprise."""
6109,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6110,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She finished Ellen's work. The happy pair were united, and started for"
6111,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Providence. Henriette declined taking any more work, as she affirmed"
6112,WITHERED LEAVES.,she must take a few stitches in her own wardrobe.
6113,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6114,WITHERED LEAVES.,Great was the consternation when the banns of marriage between Henry
6115,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Lorton and Henriette Clinton were published, the Sabbath preceding"
6116,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their wedding. Many a deep flush darted over the youthful cheek, and"
6117,WITHERED LEAVES.,"many a head was tossed scornfully, and a sea of eyes were turned"
6118,WITHERED LEAVES.,towards the humble seat Henriette usually occupied.
6119,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6120,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Arrayed in a simple robe of India muslin, Henry led the blushing"
6121,WITHERED LEAVES.,Henriette to the altar of Hymen. They were acquainted with each
6122,WITHERED LEAVES.,"other's characters, in the abstract."
6123,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6124,WITHERED LEAVES.,"After a pleasant tour north, they returned again to the village, and"
6125,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Henriette was surprised when they arrived there, to find the carriage"
6126,WITHERED LEAVES.,stop at the home of her childhood.
6127,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6128,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mr. Norcross, failing from his former premises, to reach the station"
6129,WITHERED LEAVES.,"he wished in society, was about returning to Philadelphia, and Henry"
6130,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Lorton, who in reality was a very wealthy man, had purchased it,"
6131,WITHERED LEAVES.,unbeknown to any one.
6132,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6133,WITHERED LEAVES.,The dear familiar faces of her parents were again hung in the old
6134,WITHERED LEAVES.,"familiar places, upon the library walls, beaming upon her with looks"
6135,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of fond affection, and shedding the sweet smile of earlier days upon"
6136,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her. The books were neatly arranged on the polished shelves, and as"
6137,WITHERED LEAVES.,"she again resumed her accustomed seat by the window, and looked out"
6138,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the summit of the lofty mountains, they seemed like old familiar"
6139,WITHERED LEAVES.,"friends, welcoming her return, and assumed the strange, mysterious"
6140,WITHERED LEAVES.,"shapes, that so attracted her childish gaze; and the trees that stood"
6141,WITHERED LEAVES.,"nodding in the pure winds of heaven, seemed beckoning her to their"
6142,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cooling shades, and she felt that the sunlight of her early home was"
6143,WITHERED LEAVES.,"again shedding its glad beams around her, and enjoyed that subdued"
6144,WITHERED LEAVES.,"happiness, that only can be learned by an acquaintance with sorrow."
6145,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6146,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Often as she thus sat in the pensive twilight hour, listening to the"
6147,WITHERED LEAVES.,"murmur of the evening breeze, the voices of her dear parents would"
6148,WITHERED LEAVES.,"seem stealing upon her ear in well remembered tones, whispering of"
6149,WITHERED LEAVES.,happiness and heaven; and she felt a sweet and holy calm steal over
6150,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her spirits, and felt that ""angels indeed ministered"" unto her."
6151,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6152,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Henry invited her to ride with him, and her beautiful Sullensifadda"
6153,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stood pawing at the door, richly caparisoned, while the groom held her"
6154,WITHERED LEAVES.,father's dapple grey by the bridle for Henry. As they galloped slowly
6155,WITHERED LEAVES.,"up the mountain pass, the monuments of her dear parents glittering in"
6156,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the sun admonished her that connubial bliss cannot shield from death,"
6157,WITHERED LEAVES.,for her mother had fallen a victim when she was a young and happy
6158,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bride, and her young heart had just felt the dawnings of a mother's"
6159,WITHERED LEAVES.,"love. She raised her thoughts to God in fervent supplication, that He"
6160,WITHERED LEAVES.,still would be the Father of the fatherless.
6161,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6162,WITHERED LEAVES.,It was painful to Henriette to witness the cringing servility of many
6163,WITHERED LEAVES.,who formerly treated her with contempt; but she had learned many
6164,WITHERED LEAVES.,"useful lessons in poverty, that affluence never would have taught her,"
6165,WITHERED LEAVES.,and she ever endeavored to throw the sweet garb of charity over the
6166,WITHERED LEAVES.,"frailties of her fellow men, and especially did the destitute orphan"
6167,WITHERED LEAVES.,ever find sympathy and assistance from her generous aid. Fleeting
6168,WITHERED LEAVES.,"years have borne away many of the actors in this little drama, and the"
6169,WITHERED LEAVES.,grass grows green upon their graves. Other eyes have learned to look
6170,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the mountains, and trace ideal imagery upon their shadowy sides."
6171,WITHERED LEAVES.,Little feet imprint the terraced walk to the winding banks of the blue
6172,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Juniata, and watch the bubbles that float upon the stream. No change"
6173,WITHERED LEAVES.,had passed upon the silver bosom of the waters.
6174,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6175,WITHERED LEAVES.,Henriette is happy in the dear old home. Her old nurse is the nurse of
6176,WITHERED LEAVES.,her children. A manly form is by her side; tender words are spoken in
6177,WITHERED LEAVES.,a deep-toned voice; but it is the husband of her youth instead of the
6178,WITHERED LEAVES.,father of her childhood. Happy in the affections of her husband and
6179,WITHERED LEAVES.,"children, and in the faithful performance of those sweet duties that"
6180,WITHERED LEAVES.,"devolve upon her as a wife and mother, Henriette spends her useful"
6181,WITHERED LEAVES.,life in the exercise of those virtues she only learned from reverses
6182,WITHERED LEAVES.,in fortune. Henry too is happy. Disgusted with flattering attentions
6183,WITHERED LEAVES.,"paid to wealth, he had won him a name and a bride, while his"
6184,WITHERED LEAVES.,circumstances were unknown. He had watched unobserved the patient
6185,WITHERED LEAVES.,"endurance and unwavering industry of Henriette Clinton, and resolved"
6186,WITHERED LEAVES.,they should not go unrewarded.
6187,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6188,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The smile of heaven rests upon the happy household, and it is invoked"
6189,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by the voice of ardent prayer, and the family kneel together around"
6190,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the family altar, and the rich, deep-toned voice of Henry offers up"
6191,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the morning and evening sacrifice, rendering praise and thanksgiving"
6192,WITHERED LEAVES.,to the giver of every good and perfect gift.
6193,WITHERED LEAVES.,

6202,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I've been wandering long in sunlit bow'rs,"
6203,WITHERED LEAVES.,Chasing butterflies and flow'rs;
6204,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And this bright garland round my hair,"
6205,WITHERED LEAVES.,Is one that I've been twining there.
6206,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6207,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Happy child of the garland gay,"
6208,WITHERED LEAVES.,Whither wanderest thou to play?
6209,WITHERED LEAVES.,I've been floating bubbles on silver streams:
6210,WITHERED LEAVES.,Printing the sand with golden dreams;
6211,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I've wandered widely all the day,"
6212,WITHERED LEAVES.,And feel much wearied with my play.
6213,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6214,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Gentle child of the languid brow,"
6215,WITHERED LEAVES.,What is this comes o'er thee now?
6216,WITHERED LEAVES.,"My wearied limbs are filled with pain,"
6217,WITHERED LEAVES.,A scorching fever burns my brain;
6218,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Hope dances not before my eyes,"
6219,WITHERED LEAVES.,But only points beyond the skies.
6220,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6221,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Wasted child of the marble brow,"
6222,WITHERED LEAVES.,Mysterious death steals o'er thee now.
6223,WITHERED LEAVES.,"How pale and ghastly is thy cheek,"
6224,WITHERED LEAVES.,Thy quiv'ring lips refuse to speak;
6225,WITHERED LEAVES.,Fluttering and pausing comes thy breath:--
6226,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It ceases now, thou 'rt cold in death."
6227,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6228,WITHERED LEAVES.,"There hangs the wreath which yesterday,"
6229,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Like thee, was blooming bright and gay;"
6230,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Emblem still, its leaves are dead,"
6231,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Their colors gone, their beauty fled;"
6232,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But withered roses shed perfume,"
6233,WITHERED LEAVES.,That live beyond the mould'ring tomb.
6234,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6235,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Happy child of the angel brow,"
6236,WITHERED LEAVES.,Brighter wreaths entwine thee now;
6237,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Thy paths are spread thro' fairer bow'rs,"
6238,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Adorned with amaranthine flow'rs,"
6239,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And ever happy thou wilt be,"
6240,WITHERED LEAVES.,Thro' a blest eternity.
6241,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6242,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But I must bid thee farewell now,"

6252,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Turn fate's decrees aside,"
6253,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Death had not borne her to the tomb,--"

6276,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But, oh! forbear, nor let thy tears,"
6277,WITHERED LEAVES.,Drop on this mould'ring sod;--

6284,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Spake less of earth than heaven,"
6285,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6286,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And soon thy dream of life will close,--"

6291,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And then, perhaps, this cherub form,"
6292,WITHERED LEAVES.,"From sin so soon set free,"
6293,WITHERED LEAVES.,"May, with a daughter's greeting warm,"

6296,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Perhaps, the joys on earth denied,"

6316,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6317,WITHERED LEAVES.,The strictest harmony and order pervade nature in all her works. She

6319,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in vain to imitate. If we contemplate the azure sky, with all its"

6321,WITHERED LEAVES.,"nightly course through the boundless fields of ether, we shall readily"

6327,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to each succeeding year, ""the seasons and their changes."""
6328,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6329,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The gentle moon, as she sheds her borrowed light from the blue"
6330,WITHERED LEAVES.,"chambers of the sky, throwing her silver mantle overnight's sable"

6332,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of turning."" Every planet and every star has its fixed place assigned"
6333,WITHERED LEAVES.,"it, and even the fiery comet has its appointed orbit, and the man of"
6334,WITHERED LEAVES.,"science can tell the exact time of its appearance, and the course it"
6335,WITHERED LEAVES.,"will run, and now it is accounted for by the laws of nature, rather"
6336,WITHERED LEAVES.,than regarded as a fearful herald of war or devastation; and even the
6337,WITHERED LEAVES.,"meteor flash, that glares for a moment and then disappears forever, is"
6338,WITHERED LEAVES.,"awakened into action by the density of the atmosphere, and regulated"

6340,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6341,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The portentous thunder clouds that emit the vivid lightning's flash,"

6361,WITHERED LEAVES.,"magnificence, the gently sloping hill and verdant vale, are so"
6362,WITHERED LEAVES.,"arranged as to fill the mind of the beholder with satisfaction, while"

6369,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6370,WITHERED LEAVES.,"This is a theme upon which the most powerful mind may expand itself,"
6371,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stretching from thought to thought, and from object to object, without"
6372,WITHERED LEAVES.,grasping half the amazing whole. When we contemplate the forest
6373,WITHERED LEAVES.,"standing in silent grandeur, the tree, the shrub, the flower in all"
6374,WITHERED LEAVES.,"its beautiful varieties, the rock, the precipice, the foaming cataract"
6375,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that has thundered on for ages with the same deafening roar, and all"
6376,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the ten thousand varied objects of inanimate creation, and observe"
6377,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the nice regulations in which they are placed, we can but remark with"
6378,WITHERED LEAVES.,"reverential awe, ""In wisdom hast thou made them all."""

6380,WITHERED LEAVES.,"If we find beauty thus depicted in the inanimate, how much greater"

6383,WITHERED LEAVES.,"life, from the sponge that clings to the rock, to the mighty leviathan"
6384,WITHERED LEAVES.,that sports amid the bounding billows.
6385,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6386,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Or search we the air, we find it peopled with myriads of floating"
6387,WITHERED LEAVES.,"insects, on silken wings, each moving in its own little sphere, and"
6388,WITHERED LEAVES.,"then passing away. The spotted butterfly, that flits through the air,"
6389,WITHERED LEAVES.,"on fairy wing, or rests its downy pinions on the bosom of the fragrant"
6390,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rose; the bird that carols on the spray, or warbles sweetly through"
6391,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the air; the mountain bee, that comes humming round the summer"
6392,WITHERED LEAVES.,"flower, sipping its store of sweets, and even the drowsy hum of the"
6393,WITHERED LEAVES.,"summer-fly, as it floats in mazy circles, are all connecting links in"
6394,WITHERED LEAVES.,nature's chain.
6395,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6396,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But where shall we stop? the spider, the cricket, the beetle, the"
6397,WITHERED LEAVES.,"glow-worm, with his feeble lamp, the firefly that flies twinkling"
6398,WITHERED LEAVES.,"through the air all the ""midsummer night,"" and every beast that roams"
6399,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the field, whether wild or tame, all--all have their proper sphere,"
6400,WITHERED LEAVES.,and are in proper order.
6401,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6402,WITHERED LEAVES.,But we have still to contemplate the most beautiful piece of
6403,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mechanism, of nature's plastic hand, in the formation of man, for"
6404,WITHERED LEAVES.,"whose convenience and use, all things else seem created. A careless"
6405,WITHERED LEAVES.,"observer looks upon man, and sees in the general outline a beautiful"
6406,WITHERED LEAVES.,"piece of mechanism, moving in grace and dignity, and standing in an"
6407,WITHERED LEAVES.,"exalted position upon the earth. He, too, has his place assigned him,"
6408,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by the order of nature, and moves in the highest sphere of earthly"
6409,WITHERED LEAVES.,"being. By the useful and interesting study of physiology, we are"
6410,WITHERED LEAVES.,"enabled to define the construction of his system, to delineate the"
6411,WITHERED LEAVES.,"muscles, nerves, veins and fibres, and the complicated mass that forms"
6412,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the man, with all their separate dependencies upon each other. But"
6413,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the mind, the great moving spring of action that gives motion to the"
6414,WITHERED LEAVES.,"whole, who can analyze or delineate? That will live forever, when the"
6415,WITHERED LEAVES.,stillness of death rests upon the pulses. That is the great connecting
6416,WITHERED LEAVES.,"link between time and eternity, and doomed, by the order of nature,"
6417,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to live forever, and the boundless ages of eternity alone can fully"
6418,WITHERED LEAVES.,"develop its faculties, or define its station."
6419,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6420,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And too, there is another upon earth, whose presence is often felt,"

6422,WITHERED LEAVES.,"evidences of their sojourn with the generations of men, They pass on,"
6423,WITHERED LEAVES.,"breathing upon them a chilling breath, and they are seen no more. They"
6424,WITHERED LEAVES.,"go forth, conquering and to conquer, and the king, and the beggar,"
6425,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fall alike, before their ruthless sway."
6426,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6427,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But, there is yet the great unchanging God, for whose honor and glory"
6428,WITHERED LEAVES.,"all things are and were created, who ""spake and it was done,"" and who"
6429,WITHERED LEAVES.,"has taught us by revelation, that the heavens shall be rolled together"

6441,WITHERED LEAVES.,Ere Summer spreads her sultry wing;
6442,WITHERED LEAVES.,And she retires with hasty pace
6443,WITHERED LEAVES.,To give to sober Autumn place;
6444,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Who scatters fruits and flowers around,"
6445,WITHERED LEAVES.,And then to Winter leaves the ground;
6446,WITHERED LEAVES.,"With frost and snow and tempests drear,"
6447,WITHERED LEAVES.,He closes each succeeding year.
6448,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But though so swift they pass from view,"
6449,WITHERED LEAVES.,Each has its portioned work to do.
6450,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Spring must unbind the icy chains,"

6452,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Call the feather'd songsters home,"
6453,WITHERED LEAVES.,That far in southern climates roam:
6454,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Must bid the springing grass appear,"

6460,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6461,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She takes the garland bright and gay,"
6462,WITHERED LEAVES.,Fresh from the blooming lap of May:
6463,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Unfolds the casings from the flow'rs,"
6464,WITHERED LEAVES.,And flings them o'er her sylvan bow'rs;
6465,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Brings all their hidden tints to view,"
6466,WITHERED LEAVES.,Gives to their leaves a deeper hue:
6467,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Sends forth the bee and butterfly,"
6468,WITHERED LEAVES.,"On downy pinions soaring high,"
6469,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Or sporting gay from flow'r to flow'r,"
6470,WITHERED LEAVES.,Through the short lived Summer hour.
6471,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She brings, on every passing breeze,"
6472,WITHERED LEAVES.,Some fragrant odor from the trees;
6473,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Spreads out rich beauties to the eye,"
6474,WITHERED LEAVES.,And softly breathes her gentlest sigh;
6475,WITHERED LEAVES.,"That wakes the ripple on the stream,--"
6476,WITHERED LEAVES.,That dances in the sun's bright beam.
6477,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But summer beauties vanish soon,--"

6482,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She takes the gift from Summer fair,--"
6483,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Unbraids the tresses of her hair,"
6484,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mellows her fruits, scatters her flow'rs,"
6485,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And blights the leaves upon her bow'rs,"
6486,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then, breathes a mournful sigh around,"
6487,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And whirls them, wither'd, o'er the ground."
6488,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6489,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then Winter comes, with tempest wild,"
6490,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Nature's boisterous, willful child,"
6491,WITHERED LEAVES.,"To bind the streams in icy chains,--"
6492,WITHERED LEAVES.,Drive sleet and snow across the plains;

6508,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He must propel the early shoot,"

6521,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Pure, unsullied pages lay before me. How chaste should be the thought,"
6522,WITHERED LEAVES.,how refined the sentiment here inscribed. May this book be dedicated
6523,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to Religion, Morality and Virtue, and a deep toned piety pervade the"
6524,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thoughts and emotions here portrayed, which shall find a deep response"

6530,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6531,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As passing years bear away the glad season of youth, and usher in"

6533,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pleasant recollections of dear friends, some, perchance, who may have"
6534,WITHERED LEAVES.,"passed away with passing years, and the hand that now writes may be"

6543,WITHERED LEAVES.,Sweet flowers beside thy pathway
6544,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Are blooming, bright and gay,"

6547,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6548,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But soon they fold their withered leaves,"
6549,WITHERED LEAVES.,And fade away and die;
6550,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But still they shed a sweet perfume,"
6551,WITHERED LEAVES.,Where fallen low they lie.
6552,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6553,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But there are flowers, perennial flowers,"
6554,WITHERED LEAVES.,That bloom within the mind:
6555,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Shedding a fragrance o'er the life,"
6556,WITHERED LEAVES.,Leaving perfume behind.
6557,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6558,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Henry, may these adorn your mind,"

6562,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6563,WITHERED LEAVES.,"They shall not fade, but brighter bloom,"

6711,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was a delightful afternoon in midsummer, when I passed through New"

6714,WITHERED LEAVES.,"inexpressible emotions that crowd upon us, when, after a long absence"
6715,WITHERED LEAVES.,we anticipate a return to the bosom of a loved family.
6716,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6717,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Nature seemed tuned to sweet harmonies, and echoing the happiness that"
6718,WITHERED LEAVES.,"filled the heart, produced no discordant note. Gentle breezes fanned"

6720,WITHERED LEAVES.,"trees as they gently swung before it, and their trembling leaves"
6721,WITHERED LEAVES.,fluttered before the passing breath of the summer wind; for summer was
6722,WITHERED LEAVES.,brightly clad in all her robes of glory.
6723,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6724,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Birds carolled in wild melody their hymns of praise, and lifted their"
6725,WITHERED LEAVES.,"glad voices to Him ""who tipped their glittering wings with gold, and"
6726,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tuned their voice to praise."" Flowers were blooming in all their rich"
6727,WITHERED LEAVES.,"varieties, and the splendid boquet that had been presented me from the"
6728,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lady with whom I had been boarding several weeks, bespoke the handy"
6729,WITHERED LEAVES.,"work of its Creator, and involuntarily raised the thoughts to that"
6730,WITHERED LEAVES.,"land, where the flowers fade not, where change and decay come not."
6731,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6732,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Our journey led us by the quiet Cemetery of Greenwood, that vast"
6733,WITHERED LEAVES.,"receptacle of the city dead. As we mused upon its peaceful rest, its"
6734,WITHERED LEAVES.,"quiet shades, the transparency of the waters, that sleep in the bosom"
6735,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the sylvan lake, and then glanced upon the great thoroughfare,"
6736,WITHERED LEAVES.,"teeming with life in all its varied and changeful positions, and"
6737,WITHERED LEAVES.,reflected that every individual in that moving mass possessed an
6738,WITHERED LEAVES.,"immortal mind, and was pressing their way to these grassy avenues,"
6739,WITHERED LEAVES.,"passing on, step by step, toward the silent grave, the thought was"
6740,WITHERED LEAVES.,"overwhelming, and the question came up, ""Lord, what is man that thou"

6743,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As we crossed Fulton ferry at Brooklyn, the waters spoke in low, dirge"
6744,WITHERED LEAVES.,"like voices of the same Almighty hand, and their waves were tossed"
6745,WITHERED LEAVES.,"into gentle motion by the passing breeze, and seemed to reflect"
6746,WITHERED LEAVES.,"myriads of diamonds upon its sparkling bosom, as it lay spread out"
6747,WITHERED LEAVES.,before the eye of the beholder.
6748,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6749,WITHERED LEAVES.,The bustling throng of the city were moving down by the Battery toward
6750,WITHERED LEAVES.,the steamboat wharf. The silver fountain sent forth its sparkling
6751,WITHERED LEAVES.,"waters, and the white swan curved its graceful neck in its mimic"
6752,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lake, and the walks in the Battery were neat and inviting; but these"
6753,WITHERED LEAVES.,attracted not the attention of the passing throng. There was a more
6754,WITHERED LEAVES.,intense object of curiosity.
6755,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6756,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The beautiful Atlantic lay at the wharf, lifting high her huge steam"
6757,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pipes, emitting her blinding steam, and impatient to try her strength"
6758,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the bosom of the deep. Her deck was thronged with human beings,"
6759,WITHERED LEAVES.,"filled with impatient curiosity to see the gallant boat launch forth,"
6760,WITHERED LEAVES.,and pursue her way over the waste of waters.
6761,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6762,WITHERED LEAVES.,Little thought that gaping multitude of the rich freight that was on
6763,WITHERED LEAVES.,"board that floating bark, that was now to try its giant strength upon"
6764,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the billowy waves, the ocean of human mind broader, deeper than the"
6765,WITHERED LEAVES.,"watery waste of the wide Atlantic. O, no, they thought not of those"
6766,WITHERED LEAVES.,"priceless treasures, but it was the boat and her noble bearings that"
6767,WITHERED LEAVES.,attracted all eyes and was the absorbing theme of conversation.
6768,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6769,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Near by lay the proud Oregon, apparently boasting that she had tried"
6770,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her strength, and was now willing to contest the point with the"
6771,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stranger boat, and be her pilot down the Sound. Her decks, too, were"
6772,WITHERED LEAVES.,"crowded with passengers anxious for the approaching race, for which"
6773,WITHERED LEAVES.,every preparation was making.
6774,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6775,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The sun was sinking towards the west, and shed his subduing beams over"
6776,WITHERED LEAVES.,the face of nature. No cloud hung its fleecy curtains over the canopy
6777,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of heaven, but the arch of cerulean blue hung in deep solemn grandeur"
6778,WITHERED LEAVES.,"over the gathered crowd, over the boats at their moorings, and over"
6779,WITHERED LEAVES.,the rippling waves that mirrored back its placid smile from their own
6780,WITHERED LEAVES.,tranquil bosom.
6781,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6782,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The hour came, the cheerful bells pealed their cordial invitation for"
6783,WITHERED LEAVES.,"all to come on board, and so they hastened on; the second bell rang"
6784,WITHERED LEAVES.,"its departure to the multitude on the shore, and soon the sound of the"
6785,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fierce steam whistle, the noise of the machinery, and the splash of"
6786,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the waters, told that the boats were moving like a thing of life"
6787,WITHERED LEAVES.,over the bounding billows. The officers of the boat and many of the
6788,WITHERED LEAVES.,"passengers were hurrying round, with busy feet, and using necessary"
6789,WITHERED LEAVES.,efforts to propel their speed. As a bird cuts the air or an arrow
6790,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wings its feathery course, so sped the boats upon their onward way."
6791,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6792,WITHERED LEAVES.,The crowd on the shore watched them till they became small black
6793,WITHERED LEAVES.,"specks in the distance, and then the tumultuous tide of human life"
6794,WITHERED LEAVES.,"turned towards the city's mart, and mingled again in its busy"
6795,WITHERED LEAVES.,fluctuations and its change.
6796,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6797,WITHERED LEAVES.,There was a delightful view as the boat passed the beautiful villages
6798,WITHERED LEAVES.,and elegant mansions of the wealthy citizens upon the surrounding
6799,WITHERED LEAVES.,"shore, reflecting the mild radiance of the setting sun."
6800,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6801,WITHERED LEAVES.,"When the shadows of twilight deepened, and the sable curtains of night"
6802,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hid more distant objects from view, we could see in the dim distance"
6803,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the waste of waters, the heated steam pipes of the swift"
6804,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Atlantic, shedding a lurid glare upon the surrounding darkness."
6805,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6806,WITHERED LEAVES.,"By some failure in the fire works of the Oregon, one of the boilers"
6807,WITHERED LEAVES.,"refused to do its office, and it was a fearful sight to some on board"
6808,WITHERED LEAVES.,to witness the high pressure principle that was applied to the other
6809,WITHERED LEAVES.,to raise the steam. The blue sky was above us and the blue waters
6810,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beneath, and midnight shed her mysterious shapes and phantom shadows"
6811,WITHERED LEAVES.,"around us, and awoke memories of steamboat disasters and perishing"
6812,WITHERED LEAVES.,crews sinking into a watery grave.
6813,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6814,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The ill-fated Lexington that was burned upon this very track, came up,"
6815,WITHERED LEAVES.,"haunting the imagination with wild, fantastic dreams."
6816,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6817,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But turning from a land of fancies and of shadows, we raised a"
6818,WITHERED LEAVES.,trusting eye to the glittering host of silent stars that glistened in
6819,WITHERED LEAVES.,"all their matchless beauty in heaven's blue vault above, then listened"
6820,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to the dashing of the briny wave, and felt that God was there, that"
6821,WITHERED LEAVES.,"His eye slumbereth not, and His hand holds not only individual life,"
6822,WITHERED LEAVES.,"but the destinies of nations, and at this solemn midnight hour, when"
6823,WITHERED LEAVES.,there was no object of His creative power in sight save the spangled
6824,WITHERED LEAVES.,"arch above and the foaming waters beneath, it was sweet to look up"
6825,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to Him in confidence and trust, feeling that His Almighty arm is"
6826,WITHERED LEAVES.,omnipotent to save.
6827,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6828,WITHERED LEAVES.,About midnight the ardor of the race abated. The Atlantic veered off
6829,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in a different direction toward her destined port, and the Oregon"
6830,WITHERED LEAVES.,pursued her accustomed way to her usual landing in Stonington.
6831,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6832,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Both boats reached their places of destination in safety, and thus"
6833,WITHERED LEAVES.,passed the first night of the gallant boat upon the ocean wave.
6834,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6835,WITHERED LEAVES.,*       *       *       *       *
6836,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6837,WITHERED LEAVES.,It was a cold day when sober autumn had almost accomplished her
6838,WITHERED LEAVES.,"appointed task, and swept cleanly away the beautiful shrubs and"
6839,WITHERED LEAVES.,"flowers, and rolled the withered leaves before his chilling breath to"
6840,WITHERED LEAVES.,"prepare for the entrance of cold, freezing winter, that already began"
6841,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to send his icy messengers before him, touching the streams with their"
6842,WITHERED LEAVES.,"freezing breath, and scattering snow flakes upon the barren earth."
6843,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6844,WITHERED LEAVES.,It was on such a day when autumn came forth dressed in the icy garb of
6845,WITHERED LEAVES.,"winter, that the Atlantic again prepared to loose from her accustomed"
6846,WITHERED LEAVES.,moorings and ply her destined way to the busy city. Day after day she
6847,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had performed her journey, and was winning public confidence in her"
6848,WITHERED LEAVES.,safety and expedition.
6849,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6850,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather, many sought a passage,"
6851,WITHERED LEAVES.,desirous of reaching the distant city to spend the coming thanksgiving
6852,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with absent friends. The wind sighed in low, fitful murmurs as it"
6853,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bore the fleecy snow flakes upon its airy pinions, and flung them"
6854,WITHERED LEAVES.,"unceremoniously into the face of the passing traveler, thus warning"
6855,WITHERED LEAVES.,him of a fiercely coming storm.
6856,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6857,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The officers hesitated, as the ominous sea swell came surging on, and"
6858,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the dashing waves moaning upon the winding shore, seemed shrieking a"
6859,WITHERED LEAVES.,sad requiem over the departed.
6860,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6861,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But finally the urgency of the passengers was so great, that they"
6862,WITHERED LEAVES.,concluded to put forth upon the waste of waters and brave the fury of
6863,WITHERED LEAVES.,the midnight storm.
6864,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6865,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The bell gave its usual signal, and as its stifled sounds were borne"
6866,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the ear by the howling winds, they sounded like a death knell."
6867,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6868,WITHERED LEAVES.,"There were hurrying vehicles, and the busy tread of active feet, and"
6869,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the motley group were all on board, and many sorrowing friends stood"
6870,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the shore, breathing a tearful farewell, to the dear ones who"
6871,WITHERED LEAVES.,were going from them.
6872,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6873,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The man of God was there; he had committed his interests to the ""God"
6874,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the winds and the waves,"" and his heart was at peace."
6875,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6876,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The gay and thoughtless were there, who heeded not that ""human life is"
6877,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a vapor, that passeth soon away."""
6878,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6879,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The second bell rang, and the sound fell with that leaden weight upon"
6880,WITHERED LEAVES.,"many hearts, that so often comes upon us, when we are called to part"
6881,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from some dearly loved objects, and we feel that it may be an eternal"
6882,WITHERED LEAVES.,separation.
6883,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6884,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The boat was soon gliding over the foaming ocean, and the sorrowing"
6885,WITHERED LEAVES.,"friends returned to their homes, for the driving snow and sleet would"
6886,WITHERED LEAVES.,"not permit them to linger long, to watch its progress."
6887,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6888,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The last fond look was given, white handkerchiefs fluttered a moment"
6889,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in the sweeping blast, and the last farewell had passed between many"
6890,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fond, loving hearts."
6891,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6892,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The boat pursued her dangerous way, amid ""the windy storm and"
6893,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tempest,"" and hope animated their bosoms, and some felt sure they"
6894,WITHERED LEAVES.,should arrive in safety.
6895,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6896,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The storm and darkness increased, the wind blew with greater violence,"
6897,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and the tumultous sea hove up a hollow, bellowing sound, and seemed"
6898,WITHERED LEAVES.,threatening swift destruction.
6899,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6900,WITHERED LEAVES.,"About midnight the boat became unmanageable, and it became evident to"
6901,WITHERED LEAVES.,"all on board, that many, if not all, must perish."
6902,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6903,WITHERED LEAVES.,"O, who may paint the agony of that fearful night? when death was"
6904,WITHERED LEAVES.,"heralding his approach, in the loud surging of the ruthless blast, and"
6905,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the deep toned thunder of the many voiced waters, as they dashed their"
6906,WITHERED LEAVES.,"giant waves against the ill-fated bark, that groaned and trembled"
6907,WITHERED LEAVES.,beneath their mighty pressure.
6908,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6909,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mingling with the tumultous groans of troubled nature, arose a fearful"
6910,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cry, from lips white with fear."
6911,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6912,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The solemn voice of prayer went up, and there were none to scoff, when"
6913,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the aged man bent his knee, and lifted his heart to God in prayer,"
6914,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beseeching him, for Jesus Christ's sake, to have mercy upon their"
6915,WITHERED LEAVES.,souls. Many prayed in that hour of trial that never prayed before.
6916,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was an hour that closed the scorner's lip, and made the most"
6917,WITHERED LEAVES.,profligate feel he was in the presence of a prayer-hearing God.
6918,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6919,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The bell, as if by some mysterious agency, commenced tolling, and its"
6920,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sad knell sounded through that long night, over the bosom of the lone"
6921,WITHERED LEAVES.,sea. It was the same bell that rang so loud and clear on the day of
6922,WITHERED LEAVES.,the boat's first departure from New York; but now how different are
6923,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the tones as they mingle with ocean's wail, and the fearful shriek of"
6924,WITHERED LEAVES.,the howling blast.
6925,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6926,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was like the changes that come over us so often, as we toss upon"
6927,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the tide of life, and buffet its adverse storms."
6928,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6929,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Many, ere morning dawned, found a watery grave."
6930,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6931,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It is not my intention to particularize, but draw the contrast of the"
6932,WITHERED LEAVES.,first and last night the beautiful boat tossed upon the mighty deep.
6933,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6934,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Perchance the same eyes that witnessed her departure from the shore,"
6935,WITHERED LEAVES.,"anxiously watched her return that morning, and the anticipated"
6936,WITHERED LEAVES.,"greeting of many a dear friend burned bright in many a heart, but was"
6937,WITHERED LEAVES.,"soon--very soon--to be forever extinguished, as the loved, expected"
6938,WITHERED LEAVES.,form was even then buried beneath the ocean wave. Many a mother had
6939,WITHERED LEAVES.,"prepared the sumptuous thanksgiving breakfast, for a long-absent"
6940,WITHERED LEAVES.,"expected son, who, perchance, was offering up his thanksgiving anthem"
6941,WITHERED LEAVES.,before the throne of God.
6942,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6943,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Hoary age and helpless infancy fell alike, before the destroying"
6944,WITHERED LEAVES.,"angel, and there were vacancies in almost all the relations of life."
6945,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6946,WITHERED LEAVES.,"How often it is thus with those who sail in life's frail bark, out"
6947,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the ocean of time. The morning may be calm and serene, and the"
6948,WITHERED LEAVES.,"golden sun shed his glad beams upon our joyous pathway, or the pale"
6949,WITHERED LEAVES.,"moon may walk forth in her beauty, accompanied by all the hosts of"
6950,WITHERED LEAVES.,"twinkling stars, to gladden the night, while gentle winds sigh around"
6951,WITHERED LEAVES.,"our dwellings, and we may pass on in the sunshine and the calm. But"
6952,WITHERED LEAVES.,"clouds will arise, tempests will come, for the waves and billows of"
6953,WITHERED LEAVES.,"human passions will surge over us, and many a frail bark is shattered"
6954,WITHERED LEAVES.,and stranded beneath their giant strength.
6955,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6956,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Weary pilgrim in life's rugged journey, there is a haven of peace,"
6957,WITHERED LEAVES.,where thy worn spirit may find rest. There is a chart to guide thee
6958,WITHERED LEAVES.,"over the troubled sea, and a pilot stands ready to steer thy little"
6959,WITHERED LEAVES.,bark aright.
6960,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6961,WITHERED LEAVES.,"His beams can ever shed a cheering ray upon thy toilsome way; and, oh,"
6962,WITHERED LEAVES.,may you see light in his light.
6963,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6964,WITHERED LEAVES.,The broad ocean of eternity lays before us; into that must our little
6965,WITHERED LEAVES.,"shallop pass, and meet its final award. This, this is all that is"
6966,WITHERED LEAVES.,"worth living for--happy entrance into the presence of God, that"
6967,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6968,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""We may bathe our weary souls,"
6969,WITHERED LEAVES.,"In seas of heavenly rest."""
6970,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6971,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6972,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6973,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6974,WITHERED LEAVES.,The Fatal Feast.
6975,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6976,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6977,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Wealth would have a birth-day ball,"
6978,WITHERED LEAVES.,A high and lordly feast:
6979,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And open'd wide his spacious hall,"
6980,WITHERED LEAVES.,And ask'd in many a guest.
6981,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6982,WITHERED LEAVES.,"They came--the trifling ones of earth,--"
6983,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A gay and thoughtless throng,"
6984,WITHERED LEAVES.,"To join in revelry and mirth,"
6985,WITHERED LEAVES.,"With music, dance and song."
6986,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6987,WITHERED LEAVES.,"High waxen tapers burning bright,"
6988,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Illum'd the brilliant hall,"
6989,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And threw their soft, enchanting light,"
6990,WITHERED LEAVES.,In dazzling rays o'er all.
6991,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6992,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Soft music echoed sweetest tones,"
6993,WITHERED LEAVES.,By unseen minstrels breath'd;
6994,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The air was laden with perfume,"
6995,WITHERED LEAVES.,From flow'rs that round were wreath'd.
6996,WITHERED LEAVES.,
6997,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Beauty was there, with brilliant eye."
6998,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And Health, with rosy cheek,--"
6999,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Manhood, with forehead stern and high,"
7000,WITHERED LEAVES.,And youth with many a freak.
7001,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7002,WITHERED LEAVES.,"All--all were sparkling, bright and gay,"
7003,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And join'd the dance or song,--"
7004,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And seem'd unto the gazer's eye,"
7005,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A happy, joyous throng."
7006,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7007,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And Wealth spread out his costly feast,"
7008,WITHERED LEAVES.,And gaily all partook:
7009,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The choicest viands cheered each guest,"
7010,WITHERED LEAVES.,As all with pleasure look.
7011,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7012,WITHERED LEAVES.,For Luxury's self ne'er spread a board
7013,WITHERED LEAVES.,"With dainties so profuse,--"
7014,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The most fastidious must be pleas'd,"
7015,WITHERED LEAVES.,For he had but to choose.
7016,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7017,WITHERED LEAVES.,"One goblet fill'd with nectar bright,"
7018,WITHERED LEAVES.,The centre seem'd to keep;
7019,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And when 'twas pass'd among the guests,"
7020,WITHERED LEAVES.,They all quaff'd long and deep.
7021,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7022,WITHERED LEAVES.,The music never ceas'd its strain;
7023,WITHERED LEAVES.,But warbl'd low and sweet;--
7024,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Sometimes, soft wailing, 'twould complain--"
7025,WITHERED LEAVES.,Then mirth the ear would greet.
7026,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7027,WITHERED LEAVES.,"All seem'd enchantment spread around,--"
7028,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A golden, fairy dream;"
7029,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And far off, mingling in the sound,"
7030,WITHERED LEAVES.,Was heard a murmuring stream.
7031,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7032,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And summer breezes softly sigh'd,--"
7033,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And wasted sweet perfume,"
7034,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Through door and lattice, open'd wide,"
7035,WITHERED LEAVES.,Around the spacious room.
7036,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7037,WITHERED LEAVES.,"When mirth was in its wildest mood,"
7038,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And reign'd in every breast,"
7039,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Sudden there stalk'd into the hall,"
7040,WITHERED LEAVES.,An uninvited guest.
7041,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7042,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The air grew chill, the lamps burn'd pale,--"
7043,WITHERED LEAVES.,"All gaz'd with wild dismay,"
7044,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The music turn'd a funeral wail,--"
7045,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then sighing, died away."
7046,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7047,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Twas Death that came into the hall,"
7048,WITHERED LEAVES.,"With visage wan and grim,"
7049,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And throwing off his sickly pall,"
7050,WITHERED LEAVES.,Disclos'd each meagre limb.
7051,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7052,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Some rose to flee, but palsied fell,"
7053,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""I'm monarch here,"" cries Death;"
7054,WITHERED LEAVES.,And falling bodies quickly tell
7055,WITHERED LEAVES.,His power o'er life and breath.
7056,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7057,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Beauty lies cold in his embrace,"
7058,WITHERED LEAVES.,And pale is manhood's brow;
7059,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The rose that crimson'd youth's fair cheek,"
7060,WITHERED LEAVES.,Lies a crush'd lily now.
7061,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7062,WITHERED LEAVES.,"All, all have sank beneath his dart,"
7063,WITHERED LEAVES.,Save fashion's ruthless hold;
7064,WITHERED LEAVES.,She still maintains her iron grasp
7065,WITHERED LEAVES.,O'er bodies pale and cold.
7066,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7067,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Gold glitters on the pallid brow,"
7068,WITHERED LEAVES.,And glassy eye-balls stare
7069,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Through glossy ringlets, clustering bright,"
7070,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Of silken, raven hair."
7071,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7072,WITHERED LEAVES.,"All, all had bow'd to Fashion's shrine,"
7073,WITHERED LEAVES.,"To deck the living form,"
7074,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Through which will drag its length'ned slime,"
7075,WITHERED LEAVES.,The crawling coffin worm.
7076,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7077,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The morning sun had risen high,"
7078,WITHERED LEAVES.,And brightly shone o'er all;
7079,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But comes no voice, and wakes no eye"
7080,WITHERED LEAVES.,Within that spacious hall.
7081,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7082,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A traveller passing by that morn,"
7083,WITHERED LEAVES.,Marvell'd that all so long
7084,WITHERED LEAVES.,Should linger in that festive hall
7085,WITHERED LEAVES.,With revelry and song.
7086,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7087,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And so alighting from his steed,"
7088,WITHERED LEAVES.,"He cross'd the portal high,"
7089,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And glancing o'er the silent hall,"
7090,WITHERED LEAVES.,The sad sight met his eye.
7091,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7092,WITHERED LEAVES.,With lightning's speed he hurri'd forth
7093,WITHERED LEAVES.,"To tell the dismal tale,"
7094,WITHERED LEAVES.,And soon were gather'd sorrowing friends
7095,WITHERED LEAVES.,"From mountain, hill, and dale."
7096,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7097,WITHERED LEAVES.,Sad was the fun'ral wail that rose
7098,WITHERED LEAVES.,From that infected hall;
7099,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Nought could the different forms define,"
7100,WITHERED LEAVES.,But Fashion's slimpsey pall.
7101,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7102,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And there they rais'd one common tomb,"
7103,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And left them to their sleep,"
7104,WITHERED LEAVES.,'Till Christ's loud trump shall wake the dead
7105,WITHERED LEAVES.,"From slumber, long and deep."
7106,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7107,WITHERED LEAVES.,The marble monument they rais'd
7108,WITHERED LEAVES.,Doth this instruction bear:
7109,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""The things of earth pass soon away,"
7110,WITHERED LEAVES.,"To meet your God prepare."""
7111,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7112,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Many voices from the dead,"
7113,WITHERED LEAVES.,Here bid you well beware;
7114,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Tho' youth may bloom upon your cheek,"
7115,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Still, still for death prepare."
7116,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7117,WITHERED LEAVES.,The flowing nectar that had grac'd
7118,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The centre of the whole,"
7119,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And so enlivened every guest,"
7120,WITHERED LEAVES.,Had death within the bowl.
7121,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7122,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Some small ingredient, when 'twas fix'd,"
7123,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Was left by a mistake,"
7124,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And others were together mix'd,"
7125,WITHERED LEAVES.,That active poison make.
7126,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7127,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7128,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7129,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7130,WITHERED LEAVES.,To the Maiden
7131,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7132,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7133,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Maiden, have not the joys of earth"
7134,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Prov'd fleeting, and of little worth?"
7135,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And when the summer sun rode high,"
7136,WITHERED LEAVES.,Have clouds ne'er flitted o'er the sky?
7137,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Has Hope ne'er sprung beside thy way,"
7138,WITHERED LEAVES.,And blossom'd only to decay?
7139,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Has Friendship never chang'd her tone,"
7140,WITHERED LEAVES.,And 'woke a sigh for pleasures gone?
7141,WITHERED LEAVES.,Has Love ne'er shed his fitful gleam
7142,WITHERED LEAVES.,Across thy path--then hid his beam?
7143,WITHERED LEAVES.,Hast thou ne'er felt the solemn truth--
7144,WITHERED LEAVES.,That palsied age must steal o'er youth;
7145,WITHERED LEAVES.,And that the auburn tresses gay
7146,WITHERED LEAVES.,Must soon be chang'd for mournful gray?
7147,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Has sickness never pal'd the rose,"
7148,WITHERED LEAVES.,"That on the cheek of beauty glows,"
7149,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And ghastly death, with funeral gloom,"
7150,WITHERED LEAVES.,Oft call'd the lovely to the tomb?
7151,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Ah, maiden, yes, that tell-tale sigh,"
7152,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The downcast glances of thine eye,"
7153,WITHERED LEAVES.,Say that thy heart is but the tomb
7154,WITHERED LEAVES.,Of hopes that wither'd in their bloom;--
7155,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Say that, where all things else decay,"
7156,WITHERED LEAVES.,Thy fragile form must pass away.
7157,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then why so fondly cling to earth,"
7158,WITHERED LEAVES.,Whose joys are of so little worth?
7159,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But rather raise your thoughts on high,"
7160,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Where Hope's fair promises ne'er die,"
7161,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Where ghastly death holds no domain,"
7162,WITHERED LEAVES.,But endless youth and beauty reign.

7174,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7175,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And tyrant death, with icy hand,"

7245,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7246,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Your little rose-bush springs to view,"
7247,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Your daffodils and daisies too,"
7248,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And ev'rything comes back but you,"
7249,WITHERED LEAVES.,My poor little brother.
7250,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7251,WITHERED LEAVES.,"O, could I ope the grassy mound,"
7252,WITHERED LEAVES.,"With which your lovely form is bound,"
7253,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And break your slumber, so profound,"
7254,WITHERED LEAVES.,My poor little brother.
7255,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7256,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then gentle mother'd cease to mourn,"
7257,WITHERED LEAVES.,And speak to me in that sad tone;
7258,WITHERED LEAVES.,And pity me because alone;
7259,WITHERED LEAVES.,"O, come back, my brother."
7260,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7261,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And yet, I know, it cannot be,"
7262,WITHERED LEAVES.,That thou wilt ever come to me;
7263,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But I must shortly go to thee,"
7264,WITHERED LEAVES.,My poor little brother.
7265,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7266,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I know that thy once lovely form,"
7267,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Now feeds the cruel coffin worm,--"
7268,WITHERED LEAVES.,And that corruption doth deform
7269,WITHERED LEAVES.,"All traces of my brother,"
7270,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7271,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I know that life will swiftly glide,--"
7272,WITHERED LEAVES.,"That death's bark floats upon the tide,"
7273,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And soon will lay me by your side,"
7274,WITHERED LEAVES.,My dear buried brother.
7275,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7276,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then may our souls together reign,"
7277,WITHERED LEAVES.,"On yonder bright, aerial plain,"
7278,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And shout a loud, seraphic strain,"
7279,WITHERED LEAVES.,"In happiness, my brother."
7280,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7281,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7282,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7283,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7284,WITHERED LEAVES.,The Twins
7285,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7286,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7287,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was a sad day in autumn, pale, withering autumn, when a little"
7288,WITHERED LEAVES.,group of friends collected round the cradle of an infant of a few
7289,WITHERED LEAVES.,"weeks, who had tasted the cup of life, and now was turning seemingly"
7290,WITHERED LEAVES.,disappointed away from the bitter portion. The mild blue eyes were
7291,WITHERED LEAVES.,"raised to heaven, and that heavenly angelic expression, so peculiar"
7292,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to expiring infancy rested upon his face, which was lovely in the"
7293,WITHERED LEAVES.,"extreme, though wasted by disease. He was tenacious of life, and"
7294,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lingered long in the embrace of the pale messenger, although the eye"
7295,WITHERED LEAVES.,was dim and the wrist pulseless.
7296,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7297,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The father, mother, sister, and brother, and grandmother, sat watching"
7298,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the quivering flame that would rally for a few moments, then wane"
7299,WITHERED LEAVES.,"again. Near by sat the nurse, bearing upon her lap the little twin"
7300,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sister, who had her birth at the same hour with him, and who, like him"
7301,WITHERED LEAVES.,"too, was passing away."
7302,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7303,WITHERED LEAVES.,"How soon they wearied of life, those frail, gentle ones, and the angel"
7304,WITHERED LEAVES.,"came to bear them to a brighter, holier world, where the purity of"
7305,WITHERED LEAVES.,their sinless spirits should remain untarnished by the blight and
7306,WITHERED LEAVES.,pollutions of earth.
7307,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7308,WITHERED LEAVES.,"We watched till the sun went down in the western sky, dim and shadowy,"
7309,WITHERED LEAVES.,"enshrined long before his setting by a yellow autumnal haze, that cast"
7310,WITHERED LEAVES.,a melancholy subduing shade over the face of decaying nature that hung
7311,WITHERED LEAVES.,"out her fading flowers and withered leaves, as a token of the sad"
7312,WITHERED LEAVES.,"change that was passing in her realm, while the evening breeze, as it"
7313,WITHERED LEAVES.,"swayed the branches of the trees, bearing many a leaf to the ground,"
7314,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and drifting them before his melancholy breath, seemed sighing a sad"
7315,WITHERED LEAVES.,requiem over departed glory.
7316,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7317,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Such a scene, at such an hour, spoke forcibly of the varied changes"
7318,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and uncertainties of life, and as we looked upon the marble paleness"
7319,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the dear children, and compared them with the withering flowers"
7320,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beneath the window, we felt that human life is but a flower that"
7321,WITHERED LEAVES.,perisheth.
7322,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7323,WITHERED LEAVES.,"In this instance, the worm had sapped the bud ere the brighter tints"
7324,WITHERED LEAVES.,"were developed. As we stood in that chamber of death, we felt that God"
7325,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was present, that He who had given life was about to take it back to"
7326,WITHERED LEAVES.,"reign with Him, and though the deep fountains of grief were stirred,"
7327,WITHERED LEAVES.,"there came a ""still, small voice,"" heard through the silence of"
7328,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that lone room, ""Be still, and know that I am God,"" and we bowed in"
7329,WITHERED LEAVES.,submission to the Divine will.
7330,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7331,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The mist broke from the face of the sun, and his last setting beams"
7332,WITHERED LEAVES.,"looked forth clear and bright upon the earth, tinging the fleecy"
7333,WITHERED LEAVES.,"clouds with gold and purple, and they looked like gorgeous piles"
7334,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of molten gold, over hung with crimson purple curtains, forming a"
7335,WITHERED LEAVES.,sumptuous canopy to decorate the heavens.
7336,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7337,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Even so with the babe, life's feeble taper seemed to revive and emit a"
7338,WITHERED LEAVES.,"brilliant glare for a moment, the lips parted, the eyes wandered from"
7339,WITHERED LEAVES.,"object to object, and seemed to survey all the room contained, gazing"
7340,WITHERED LEAVES.,"most earnestly upon the face of the little sister, so soon to follow"
7341,WITHERED LEAVES.,"him, then wearily closing them with a slight struggle, the spirit"
7342,WITHERED LEAVES.,passed away.
7343,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7344,WITHERED LEAVES.,As we folded him in the vestments of the grave and laid him into the
7345,WITHERED LEAVES.,"silent halls of death, hope whispered of a glorious resurrection morn,"
7346,WITHERED LEAVES.,"when those blue orbs should again awake from that long peaceful sleep,"
7347,WITHERED LEAVES.,and look out upon the beauties of the upper world.
7348,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7349,WITHERED LEAVES.,"They placed his little form in a wide coffin, and laid it in the tomb"
7350,WITHERED LEAVES.,to await the coming of his little sister.
7351,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7352,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A week passed away, a week of weary watchfulness and anxiety, of pain,"
7353,WITHERED LEAVES.,"suffering and distress, and the angel returned again for the twin"
7354,WITHERED LEAVES.,spirit.
7355,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7356,WITHERED LEAVES.,It was at the deep midnight hour when he announced his mysterious
7357,WITHERED LEAVES.,"presence, by laying his icy hand and spreading his marble paleness"
7358,WITHERED LEAVES.,"over the form of the departing sister. The little frame was convulsed,"
7359,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and writhed beneath the grasp of the pale visitant, but he pitied not,"
7360,WITHERED LEAVES.,"relented not, but steady to his purpose, snapped the brittle thread of"
7361,WITHERED LEAVES.,"life, performed the task he had been commissioned with, and hurried"
7362,WITHERED LEAVES.,away from that place of tears to cast his deep shadow over the sun
7363,WITHERED LEAVES.,"light of other homes, and fill other hearts with grief, and cause"
7364,WITHERED LEAVES.,"other eyes to look red with weeping, ""because death has come into the"
7365,WITHERED LEAVES.,"world,"" and the children of men must fall before his withering blight."
7366,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7367,WITHERED LEAVES.,Already had decomposition commenced its repulsive work in the form of
7368,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the little son, and he was laid away, while the coffin returned"
7369,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for the other dear one, who was to moulder with him in its narrow"
7370,WITHERED LEAVES.,confines.
7371,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7372,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Deposited in the same tomb, was a coffin covered with mould, and"
7373,WITHERED LEAVES.,"just ready to drop from the shelf upon which it was placed, and the"
7374,WITHERED LEAVES.,"shrunken boards had separated, and it was perforated with large cracks"
7375,WITHERED LEAVES.,"where it had been joined together. The lid was always unscrewed, and"
7376,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was often raised by the hand of a fond mother, who looked upon the"
7377,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dust of an only daughter, who had been the idol of her heart. She had"
7378,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spared no pains in educating her, and she had well repaid the labor"
7379,WITHERED LEAVES.,bestowed upon her in the acquisition of knowledge.
7380,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7381,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She was beautiful in person, amiable in disposition, and was beloved"
7382,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by a large circle of acquaintances. She was married early, to the"
7383,WITHERED LEAVES.,"companion of her choice, who had been attentive to her from childhood,"
7384,WITHERED LEAVES.,"declaring the first time he saw her, he never saw such beautiful curls"
7385,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in his life, as Annie Grey's."
7386,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7387,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She had two little sons, and all looked bright and prosperous; Annie"
7388,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was happy in the affection of her husband, her children and her"
7389,WITHERED LEAVES.,"friends, but death lingered not for these things; he came, a most"
7390,WITHERED LEAVES.,"unwelcome visitant, and bore his unwilling victim from the presence of"
7391,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her agonized mother, ""to join the pale nations of the dead."""
7392,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7393,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She dressed her in the gilded trappings of life, bolstered her up in"
7394,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bed, and curling her beautiful hair in glossy ringlets over her pale"
7395,WITHERED LEAVES.,"face, had her likeness taken as large as life, and touched with"
7396,WITHERED LEAVES.,"natural coloring, thus preserving the form and features of her child,"
7397,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the senseless canvass, which was kept hung up in her room,"
7398,WITHERED LEAVES.,"covered with black crape, during her life time."
7399,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7400,WITHERED LEAVES.,Annie ever expressed repugnance at the idea of being deposited in
7401,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the ground, and her mother had this tomb built that she might there"
7402,WITHERED LEAVES.,"repose, and she could watch her sleeping dust as it crumbled to decay."
7403,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7404,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Who that looked in upon that mouldering mass of blackened dust, and"
7405,WITHERED LEAVES.,"contrasted it with the beautiful form that moved in life, but learned"
7406,WITHERED LEAVES.,an impressive lesson of the change that death makes upon the form of
7407,WITHERED LEAVES.,"youth and beauty? She had slept there many years, and the mother felt"
7408,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the time was approaching, when she must take the last look of those"
7409,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dear remains, and have them removed to the second vault, or buried"
7410,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beneath the grassy turf; but ere the time arrived, the great reaper"
7411,WITHERED LEAVES.,"gathered father and mother into his abundant harvest, and laid them by"
7412,WITHERED LEAVES.,her side.
7413,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7414,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Her husband, many years before, had passed from life's busy scenes,"
7415,WITHERED LEAVES.,and closed his eyes forever upon earth.
7416,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7417,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The little girl was placed in a coffin, and borne by weeping friends"
7418,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to the burial place, and with her dead brother, lay side by side,"
7419,WITHERED LEAVES.,beautiful in death.
7420,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7421,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Fresh buds were placed in the hands of each, as they lay, with their"
7422,WITHERED LEAVES.,"little arms entwined around each other, and their white marble"
7423,WITHERED LEAVES.,"faces, looking up to the pure sky above, while their half-open lids"
7424,WITHERED LEAVES.,"displaying their blue orbs, seemed looking out beneath the drooping"
7425,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fringes, to take a last farewell of earth, sun, sky, friends, and all"
7426,WITHERED LEAVES.,the endearing associations of life.
7427,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7428,WITHERED LEAVES.,A little mound was raised beside the grave of the maternal
7429,WITHERED LEAVES.,"grandfather, who had fallen suddenly, in the meridian of life, while"
7430,WITHERED LEAVES.,the strength of manhood was yet upon him. As the aged grandmother
7431,WITHERED LEAVES.,"turned from the grave of the little ones, she gave one lingering"
7432,WITHERED LEAVES.,"glance to her husband's grave, and removing her glove from her hand,"
7433,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pressed the marble slab, that stood at the head of it, and passed on,"
7434,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with a sigh and a tear, to fulfil the remaining duties that awaited"
7435,WITHERED LEAVES.,her in life.
7436,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7437,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She had parted from him, many long years before, and now she had lived"
7438,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her threescore years and ten, and her head was whitened with passing"
7439,WITHERED LEAVES.,years; but the infant of a few days had gone before her. But a few
7440,WITHERED LEAVES.,"more years passed, and you looked in vain upon earth for that weary"
7441,WITHERED LEAVES.,"voyager,"

7451,WITHERED LEAVES.,They scarce outlive the sunny glare
7452,WITHERED LEAVES.,Of one short summer day.
7453,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7454,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The hours--how rapid in their flight,"
7455,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And days pass swift away,"
7456,WITHERED LEAVES.,Scarce dawning ere the shades of night
7457,WITHERED LEAVES.,Chase its bright beams away.
7458,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7459,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The dew-drop trembling on the flow'r,"
7460,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Gemm'd by the morning's ray,--"
7461,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Glitters scarce one little hour,"
7462,WITHERED LEAVES.,Ere it is dried away.
7463,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7464,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The butterfly with gilded wing,"
7465,WITHERED LEAVES.,"That flits from spray to spray,"
7466,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Is but an evanescent thing,"

7468,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7469,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The flow'rs--those gay and brilliant things,"
7470,WITHERED LEAVES.,"So charming to the eye,"
7471,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Soon fold their withered petals up,"
7472,WITHERED LEAVES.,And fade away and die.
7473,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7474,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The busy bee, with drowsy hum,"
7475,WITHERED LEAVES.,"That through the summer day,"
7476,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Flies sipping round from flow'y to flow'r,"
7477,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Bearing its sweets away,"
7478,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7479,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Is soon constrain'd by wintry winds,"
7480,WITHERED LEAVES.,"To seek her honi'd cell,"
7481,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And giving o'er her wandering life,"
7482,WITHERED LEAVES.,"In quiet there, to dwell."
7483,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7484,WITHERED LEAVES.,And rosy health that paints the cheek
7485,WITHERED LEAVES.,"With richest crimson dye,"
7486,WITHERED LEAVES.,And bids the heart of kindness speak
7487,WITHERED LEAVES.,"From beauty's flashing eye,"
7488,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7489,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Soon, soon withdraws the blushing rose,"
7490,WITHERED LEAVES.,And leaves the lily there:
7491,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Bedims the lustre of the eye,"
7492,WITHERED LEAVES.,And pales the cheek with care.
7493,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7494,WITHERED LEAVES.,I saw a smiling infant stand
7495,WITHERED LEAVES.,By its fond mother's side:
7496,WITHERED LEAVES.,She fondly pressed one dimpl'd hand
7497,WITHERED LEAVES.,With sweet maternal pride.
7498,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7499,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Her form was faultless to behold,"
7500,WITHERED LEAVES.,And every infant grace
7501,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Beam'd sweetly from her radiant eye,"
7502,WITHERED LEAVES.,And rosy dimpl'd face.
7503,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7504,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But sudden stiffness seiz'd those limbs,"
7505,WITHERED LEAVES.,A gurgling stopp'd her breath:
7506,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Those eyes that shone so bright before,"
7507,WITHERED LEAVES.,Were soon upturn'd in death.
7508,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7509,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And love that fills the youthful breast,"
7510,WITHERED LEAVES.,"With visions bright and gay,"
7511,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Oft strews his downy nest with thorns,"
7512,WITHERED LEAVES.,And quickly flies away.
7513,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7514,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And friendship, that peculiar boon,"
7515,WITHERED LEAVES.,"From God to mortals given,"
7516,WITHERED LEAVES.,"That seems a brilliant golden link,"
7517,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Uniting earth with heaven,"
7518,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7519,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Is broken off, and often turn'd"
7520,WITHERED LEAVES.,"With careless heart away,"
7521,WITHERED LEAVES.,And hatred fills the self same place
7522,WITHERED LEAVES.,Where gentle love had sway.
7523,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7524,WITHERED LEAVES.,But oh! how poison'd is the dart
7525,WITHERED LEAVES.,"That sheds its venom there,"
7526,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And drives uncherish'd from the heart,"
7527,WITHERED LEAVES.,The gift so good and fair.
7528,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7529,WITHERED LEAVES.,An aching void must ever dwell
7530,WITHERED LEAVES.,Within the stricken heart;
7531,WITHERED LEAVES.,For who can all the suff'ring tell
7532,WITHERED LEAVES.,When friends in hatred part?
7533,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7534,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then do not fondly cling to earth,"
7535,WITHERED LEAVES.,Where all things must decay:
7536,WITHERED LEAVES.,Where happiness scarce has its birth
7537,WITHERED LEAVES.,Ere it is swept away.
7538,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7539,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Lean not on earth, 'twill pierce the heart,"
7540,WITHERED LEAVES.,"At best a broken reed,"
7541,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And oft a spear where hope expires,"
7542,WITHERED LEAVES.,And peace as often bleeds.
7543,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7544,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But far beyond yon azure sky,"
7545,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Yon sparkling star-lit dome,"
7546,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Let your aspiring hopes ascend,"

7557,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I love to hear thy tender sigh,--"
7558,WITHERED LEAVES.,It charms my deep dejection.
7559,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7560,WITHERED LEAVES.,The gentle beamings of that eye
7561,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Have power to soothe each sorrow,"

7568,WITHERED LEAVES.,That gild yon rising mountains.
7569,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7570,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And constant as the Northern Bear,"
7571,WITHERED LEAVES.,"That guards the pole unceasing,"

7576,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Thy plighted vows resigning,"
7577,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Leave me and seek another love,"
7578,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I'd bear, without repining."

7580,WITHERED LEAVES.,"No discontent should fill my breast,"
7581,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But calm as summer even,"
7582,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I'd still look forward to my rest,"
7583,WITHERED LEAVES.,In yonder vaulted heaven.
7584,WITHERED LEAVES.,
7585,WITHERED LEAVES.,And still I'd breathe my pray'r for thee
7586,WITHERED LEAVES.,"With all my soul's devotion,"
7587,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Till life itself should cease to be,"
7588,WITHERED LEAVES.,And death chill'd each emotion.

7590,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then calm as day's expiring breath,"
7591,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Each injury forgiven,"
7592,WITHERED LEAVES.,"My ransom'd soul should take its flight,"

8252,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A dream like mist around me threw,"
8253,WITHERED LEAVES.,Ting'd by many a rainbow hue.
8254,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And friendship, with her smiling face,"
8255,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Clasped me within her warm embrace,"
8256,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And fondly whisper'd in mine ear,"

8261,WITHERED LEAVES.,Her words were but an idle dream;
8262,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But oh, the illusion fled too late,"

8285,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8286,WITHERED LEAVES.,And in her dark and shadowy eye

8289,WITHERED LEAVES.,Upon the brow of night.
8290,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8291,WITHERED LEAVES.,And the sweet music of her voice

8294,WITHERED LEAVES.,When southern breezes blow.
8295,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8296,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And costly gems that lady wore,"

8307,WITHERED LEAVES.,Wafted from orange bow'rs:
8308,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The fragrance mingling with perfume,"
8309,WITHERED LEAVES.,Of rare exotic flow'rs.
8310,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8311,WITHERED LEAVES.,"In thoughtful mood that lady sat,"
8312,WITHERED LEAVES.,"While her dark, lustrous eye,"

8315,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8316,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She thought upon a noble youth,"

8326,WITHERED LEAVES.,"E'en now, he hastes that maid to greet--"

8340,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8341,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Full many a bright and lovely form,"
8342,WITHERED LEAVES.,Beneath his touch had died;

8345,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8346,WITHERED LEAVES.,With noiseless step and watchful eye
8347,WITHERED LEAVES.,He stole into her bower;
8348,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She felt his chill and icy breath,"
8349,WITHERED LEAVES.,And withered in an hour.
8350,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8351,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The soft light faded from her eye,"
8352,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And pallid grew her face,"
8353,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As folded in Death's icy arms,"
8354,WITHERED LEAVES.,She felt his cold embrace.
8355,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8356,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Her breath came heavily and slow,"
8357,WITHERED LEAVES.,Vainly she tried to speak;
8358,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The life blood froze around her heart,"
8359,WITHERED LEAVES.,And curdled in her cheek.
8360,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8361,WITHERED LEAVES.,And when her maidens sought her there
8362,WITHERED LEAVES.,"At the accustomed hour,"
8363,WITHERED LEAVES.,"They found her cold and motionless,"

8397,WITHERED LEAVES.,There to repose on Jesus' breast;

8405,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8406,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8407,WITHERED LEAVES.,"This is indeed a beautiful world. As we sit by our window, and gaze"
8408,WITHERED LEAVES.,"out upon the landscape that lies spreads out, diversified by hill and"
8409,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dale, and and waving tree and murmuring rivulet; as we listen to the"
8410,WITHERED LEAVES.,"warbling of the birds, the dreamy hum of the insects, and the low"
8411,WITHERED LEAVES.,"whispering of the soft summer air, as it floats by, redolent with"
8412,WITHERED LEAVES.,"perfume of flowers, we are deeply impressed with the truth, that the"
8413,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Being, who could create such a world, must be a great and glorious"
8414,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Being, before whom we ought to humble ourselves in deep humility."
8415,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8416,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Yet the little that we are able to behold at one view, is but as a"
8417,WITHERED LEAVES.,"grain of sand upon the sea-shore, compared with the vast world that"
8418,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lies stretched out beyond our vision. Diversified by lofty mountains,"
8419,WITHERED LEAVES.,whose snow-capped summits tower far up towards the blue vault of
8420,WITHERED LEAVES.,"heaven, and are covered with perpetual clouds and mists; the mighty"
8421,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ocean, whose bosom heaves, and moans, and wails, as though convulsed"
8422,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by some terrible agony, and which, in its frantic fits, rages with"
8423,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ungovernable fury; the deep, broad, glassy rivers, that flow in quiet"
8424,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beauty, to mingle their waters with the ocean, the foaming cataract,"
8425,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the broad green prairie, variegated by nature's choicest flowers, the"
8426,WITHERED LEAVES.,"old majestic woods, that have been styled nature's cathedral, whose"
8427,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dim, silent, far-stretching aisles have never been trodden by the foot"
8428,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of man; but I must stop, overwhelmed by the magnitude of my subject."
8429,WITHERED LEAVES.,It were impossible for the most gifted pen to do justice to the
8430,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beauty, the grandeur, the sublimity of the theme."
8431,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8432,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Even those who have climbed the lofty mountain tops, and found"
8433,WITHERED LEAVES.,"themselves lost amidst the clouds, who have been rocked upon the bosom"
8434,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of the heaving ocean, and seen it when the elements held terrible"
8435,WITHERED LEAVES.,"contest, when the howling winds lashed its waves to wild frenzy, when"
8436,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the sheeted lightnings played upon its surface, and the deep, heavy"
8437,WITHERED LEAVES.,"peals of thunder reverberated through the heaven's vast concave, and"
8438,WITHERED LEAVES.,"those, too, who have traversed the broad prairie, that far as the"
8439,WITHERED LEAVES.,"eye can reach, stretches out in wavy undulations, who have heard the"
8440,WITHERED LEAVES.,"eternal thunder of the cataract, as its waters plunge madly into the"
8441,WITHERED LEAVES.,"abyss below, who have wandered amidst orange bowers and spicy groves,"
8442,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and as Pollock expresses it, ""have mused on ruins grey with years, and"
8443,WITHERED LEAVES.,"drank from old and fabulous wells, and plucked the vine that first"
8444,WITHERED LEAVES.,"born prophets plucked; and mused on famous tombs, and on the waves of"
8445,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ocean mused, and on the desert waste: the heavens and earth of every"
8446,WITHERED LEAVES.,"country, seen where'er the old inspiring Genii dwelt, aught that could"
8447,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rouse, expand, refine the soul,"" even such would fail to do justice to"
8448,WITHERED LEAVES.,the glowing theme.
8449,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8450,WITHERED LEAVES.,"What renders the pleasure that nature confers doubly valuable, is,"
8451,WITHERED LEAVES.,that it is free for all. The poor as well as the rich participate
8452,WITHERED LEAVES.,in its enjoyment. The sun dispenses its genial light and warmth as
8453,WITHERED LEAVES.,"generously upon the beggar, who seeks his daily bread from door to"
8454,WITHERED LEAVES.,"door, as upon the crowned monarch. The bird carols as sweet a lay for"
8455,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the toil-worn peasant, who labors from morn till night, to gain a"
8456,WITHERED LEAVES.,"scanty subsistence, as for the titled nobleman, who rolls along in his"
8457,WITHERED LEAVES.,gilded chariot. The little ragged sunburnt child of poverty may pluck
8458,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the wayside flowers with as much freedom as the child of wealth, who"
8459,WITHERED LEAVES.,"is nurtured upon the lap of luxury and ease. The cool summer breeze,"
8460,WITHERED LEAVES.,"laden with grateful perfume, fans the hot brow of the slave, weary and"
8461,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fainting beneath his task, as freely as it does that of his pompous"
8462,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and lordly master. Our souls seem to be united by a bond of sympathy,"
8463,WITHERED LEAVES.,with the inanimate objects of creation. There are many poor beings who
8464,WITHERED LEAVES.,"are obliged to toil from early dawn far into the hours of night, to"
8465,WITHERED LEAVES.,obtain bread for themselves and those who are dearer to them than
8466,WITHERED LEAVES.,"life, and who have never been instructed, even in the first rudiments"
8467,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of science. Yet, are they conscious of possessing bright gems of"
8468,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thought, which they find it impossible to detach from the dust and"
8469,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rubbish and cobwebs of ignorance, with which their minds are filled."
8470,WITHERED LEAVES.,"There are many such, who, bound down by the grinding hand of"
8471,WITHERED LEAVES.,"oppression, which would, if it were possible, crush out all"
8472,WITHERED LEAVES.,"aspirations of the mind for something higher, nobler, more exalted in"
8473,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the scale of being, are obliged to suppress that longing of the soul"
8474,WITHERED LEAVES.,that will at times arise to explore the mysterious labyrinths of
8475,WITHERED LEAVES.,"knowledge, yet, even such, can hold sweet communion with the works"
8476,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of creation. The great volume of nature lies open before them, and"
8477,WITHERED LEAVES.,"though, in studying its pages, they often make wild mistakes, yet they"
8478,WITHERED LEAVES.,fear no ridicule.
8479,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8480,WITHERED LEAVES.,"When they gaze upon the blue vault of heaven, bespangled with all its"
8481,WITHERED LEAVES.,"countless gems, though the conclusions they arrive at are far--very"
8482,WITHERED LEAVES.,"far from truth, yet the placid moon looks down upon them as queenly as"
8483,WITHERED LEAVES.,though they understood all the laws by which she is governed. As they
8484,WITHERED LEAVES.,"contemplate, with wonder and admiration, the shining stars with which"
8485,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the brow of night is studded, though they understood not all the"
8486,WITHERED LEAVES.,"principles that astronomy unfolds, concerning those heavenly bodies,"
8487,WITHERED LEAVES.,"yet, no scornful light flashes from those brilliant orbs, as they look"
8488,WITHERED LEAVES.,down from their high estate; and although they do sometimes emit a
8489,WITHERED LEAVES.,"merry twinkle, yet, there is nothing of ridicule in the expression:"
8490,WITHERED LEAVES.,"but it seems rather to woo the beholder, to gaze upon their wondrous"
8491,WITHERED LEAVES.,beauty.
8492,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8493,WITHERED LEAVES.,The sweet flowers look up to them as lovingly inviting them to partake
8494,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of their precious sweets, as though they understood all their several"
8495,WITHERED LEAVES.,"properties, and knew how to assign to each its place in the vegetable"
8496,WITHERED LEAVES.,"kingdom. It is true, the poor possess not all the means of the rich"
8497,WITHERED LEAVES.,for exploring what is rare and curious in the works of nature. They
8498,WITHERED LEAVES.,are obliged to confine themselves to what is presented to their view
8499,WITHERED LEAVES.,in their own immediate neighborhood; but there is enough even in the
8500,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tamest prospect, to excite the wonder and admiration of the beholder,"
8501,WITHERED LEAVES.,and to inspire them with emotions of love and gratitude towards the
8502,WITHERED LEAVES.,great Creator.
8503,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8504,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Yet, grand and beautiful and sublime as this world is, God has only"
8505,WITHERED LEAVES.,fitted it up as a temporary abode for man; he does not consider it a
8506,WITHERED LEAVES.,fit dwelling place for his children to inhabit through all eternity.
8507,WITHERED LEAVES.,"We are told that when the ""spirits of the just made perfect"" leave"
8508,WITHERED LEAVES.,"this world, they will go to a better world: a more costly and"
8509,WITHERED LEAVES.,"magnificent abode, that God has prepared for them. Yes, costly indeed,"
8510,WITHERED LEAVES.,since a title to an inheritance in that better world is purchased by
8511,WITHERED LEAVES.,the blood of his only Son; and we are told that it is not in the heart
8512,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of man to concieve of the glory and magnificence of that place, that"
8513,WITHERED LEAVES.,is to be the home of those who accept of the terms by which it is
8514,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to be secured; and what are those terms? why, merely to repent and"
8515,WITHERED LEAVES.,"believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and to seek forgivness for our sins"
8516,WITHERED LEAVES.,through his blood.
8517,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8518,WITHERED LEAVES.,"To put our trust in God, to love him supremely, and to seek to do his"
8519,WITHERED LEAVES.,will; and are not these conditions very easy? Can we help loving such
8520,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a God, so great, so good, and who has been at such infinite pains, and"
8521,WITHERED LEAVES.,given such a costly sacrifice to secure the happiness of his subjects?
8522,WITHERED LEAVES.,And can we help loving the Saviour who was willing to be made a
8523,WITHERED LEAVES.,sacrifice to secure the eternal happiness of a lost and ruined race;
8524,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and who left a home of glory, of bliss, and joy inexpressible, to come"
8525,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to a world where he must suffer persecution, contempt, and mockery;"
8526,WITHERED LEAVES.,"where he would be reviled, and spit upon, and taunted, and finally die"
8527,WITHERED LEAVES.,a cruel and ignominous death upon the cross?
8528,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8529,WITHERED LEAVES.,"All this he suffered, that sinners through his sufferings might"
8530,WITHERED LEAVES.,receive a title to the joys of that better world that God has prepared
8531,WITHERED LEAVES.,"for those that love him. Oh how cold, how hard, how utterly lost to"
8532,WITHERED LEAVES.,"all grateful emotions, must that heart be that could treat with scorn"
8533,WITHERED LEAVES.,"or indifference that dear Saviour who has done so much for them, and"
8534,WITHERED LEAVES.,"prepared for all who will accept, a happy entrance into a world of"
8535,WITHERED LEAVES.,ineffable light and glory.

8539,WITHERED LEAVES.,"countenance lights the place, and the Lamb is in the midst; He who was"
8540,WITHERED LEAVES.,"offered for the remission of sin. Who would not enter this world, of"
8541,WITHERED LEAVES.,"happiness, where sin enters not, pain or sickness come not, and death"
8542,WITHERED LEAVES.,is swallowed up in victory? Where the saints of the most high God are
8543,WITHERED LEAVES.,"clothed upon with the righteousness of Christ, and the ""spirits of the"

8546,WITHERED LEAVES.,

8783,WITHERED LEAVES.,

8808,WITHERED LEAVES.,A Picture of Human Life.
8809,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8810,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8811,WITHERED LEAVES.,It was morning. Rosy fingered Aurora lifted the gorgeous curtains of
8812,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the east, and unlocked the golden gates of light, ushering in the"
8813,WITHERED LEAVES.,"young king of day. The glad earth, bathed with the dews of night, and"
8814,WITHERED LEAVES.,"redolent with flowers, lay blushing and rejoicing beneath his radiant"
8815,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beams, and blooming nature strode forth, clad in his most beautiful"
8816,WITHERED LEAVES.,"garments, while the murmurs of the waterfall, the sigh of the breeze,"
8817,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the carol of the birds, and the hum of busy life--all fell upon the"
8818,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ear, making enchanting melody--music that touched the soul."
8819,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8820,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Cradled in its downy bed, beneath a window closely curtained, to"
8821,WITHERED LEAVES.,"obstruct the light, lay a sleeping infant, whose dawn of life had just"
8822,WITHERED LEAVES.,begun. Its very helplessness demanded our love and pity. It smiled and
8823,WITHERED LEAVES.,"wept, but knew not why; but succeeding days added strength and vigor"
8824,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to his frame, and he came forth in all the sportiveness and beauty of"
8825,WITHERED LEAVES.,infant loveliness.
8826,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8827,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was noon; the sun had gained his zenith in the heavens, and shed"
8828,WITHERED LEAVES.,"down his scorching rays upon the parched earth, that lay drooping"
8829,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beneath his noon-day beams. Scarce a leaf was seen to move, the birds"
8830,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sat silent with folded wing, in the leafy branches, the flowers hung"
8831,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fainting upon their stems, and nature shrank from the oppressive heat."
8832,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8833,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The cradled infant had passed from infancy to childhood, from"
8834,WITHERED LEAVES.,"childhood to youth, from youth to manhood, through the various changes"
8835,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that mark each successive period, and he now stood in the meridian of"
8836,WITHERED LEAVES.,"life,"
8837,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8838,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""With all his blushing honors thick upon him."""
8839,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8840,WITHERED LEAVES.,"His brow was marked by care and anxiety, and he seemed ambitious"
8841,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to win a name. ""Fear first assailed the child, and he trembled and"
8842,WITHERED LEAVES.,"screamed; but at a frown, with youth came love, torturing the hapless"
8843,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bosom, where fierce flames of rage, resentment, jealousy contend."
8844,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Disturbed ambition presented next, to bid him grasp the moon and"
8845,WITHERED LEAVES.,"waste his days in angry sighs, add deep rivalry for shadows, till"
8846,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to conclude the wretched catalogue, appears pale avarice, straining"
8847,WITHERED LEAVES.,"delusive counters to his breast, e'en in the hour of death."" Such are"
8848,WITHERED LEAVES.,human passions.
8849,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8850,WITHERED LEAVES.,It was evening; the curtains of the west were tinged with the varied
8851,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dyes of sunset, and nature seemed revived by the cool, fresh evening"
8852,WITHERED LEAVES.,"breeze, and smiled complacently beneath the sun's last ray. The full"
8853,WITHERED LEAVES.,"orbed moon arose in the east, and the crystal streams reflected"
8854,WITHERED LEAVES.,"myriads of diamonds beneath her silver beams, and the stars, those"
8855,WITHERED LEAVES.,"golden lamps of night, shone bright in the blue chambers of the sky."
8856,WITHERED LEAVES.,"An aged man was leaning on his staff, the vigor of life had departed,"
8857,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his locks were thin and scattered, his palsied limbs would scarce"
8858,WITHERED LEAVES.,perform their office. His eye was dim--no longer beaming with
8859,WITHERED LEAVES.,"intelligence, and he muttered to himself, as he groped his way along,"
8860,WITHERED LEAVES.,"worn out with the cares, sorrows and perplexities of a busy life,"
8861,WITHERED LEAVES.,"deep furrows were upon his cheeks, and his whole appearance bespoke"
8862,WITHERED LEAVES.,"a weary, way-worn child of earth. He took his solitary way, down a"
8863,WITHERED LEAVES.,"retired path, thickly shaded with fir, holly and yew, through whose"
8864,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thick foliage the struggling moonbeam scarce could penetrate, and"
8865,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the air was filled with humid vapors, gloomy silence as of the tomb"
8866,WITHERED LEAVES.,"reigned around, but exhausted nature sank, and the aged man pillowed"
8867,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his head upon the bosom of earth, and closed his weary eyes to rest,"
8868,WITHERED LEAVES.,for he was a homeless wanderer.
8869,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8870,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was deep, solemn midnight; a dense cloud had obscured the sky,"
8871,WITHERED LEAVES.,and hid the refulgent light of the moon; the wind howled in fitful
8872,WITHERED LEAVES.,"murmurs, the thunder rolled in the distance, lightnings glared, and"
8873,WITHERED LEAVES.,"nature wrapped herself in the sable shroud of midnight, and seemed"
8874,WITHERED LEAVES.,shrieking a death-wail in her many voices.
8875,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8876,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Beside the gray haired man stood a pale visitant from the spirit land,"
8877,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to summons him away; he laid his icy hand upon his waning pulse, and"
8878,WITHERED LEAVES.,"chilled the current of his struggling breath. No friend was nigh, but"
8879,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his spirit passed gently away, leaving his countenance placid and"
8880,WITHERED LEAVES.,serene in death.
8881,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8882,WITHERED LEAVES.,Such is the end of human life. A little mound of heaped up earth marks
8883,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the spot, where the weary pilgrim is at rest. All who tread in the"
8884,WITHERED LEAVES.,"path way of life, must lie down too, ""with the pale nations of the"
8885,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dead,"" mingle with common dust, and become the sport of the winds."

8897,WITHERED LEAVES.,"So, youthful beauty soon must fail;"
8898,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The eye grow dim, the cheek grow pale;"

8963,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mysterious messenger, where dost bear those whom thou dost convey"
8964,WITHERED LEAVES.,"away?--but hark! that voice! husky, hollow, but impressive, the spirit"
8965,WITHERED LEAVES.,"shall return unto God who gave it. But now I see thee more distinctly,"
8966,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thou grisly monster; I know thy form, thou conqueror of conquerors,"
8967,WITHERED LEAVES.,and thou king of kings. But yesterday I saw a smiling infant in its
8968,WITHERED LEAVES.,fond mother's arms; a thousand dimpling smiles played around its
8969,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beautiful features, and its eyes beamed with brilliancy; thou didst"
8970,WITHERED LEAVES.,"approach, and lay thy icy hand upon its fluttering pulses, and all"
8971,WITHERED LEAVES.,was still. The parted lips had closed with the passing smile yet
8972,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon them, the eye had ceased to roll, that little form was cold"
8973,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and motionless as the clods of the valley, life had ebbed away, the"
8974,WITHERED LEAVES.,mysterious link that bound the soul to the body was broken; the spirit
8975,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had departed; many witnessed the expiring struggle, but none saw the"
8976,WITHERED LEAVES.,spirit as it took its flight from its clay tenement; yet it had gone
8977,WITHERED LEAVES.,with thee over yon dark stream.
8978,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8979,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Again I entered the chamber where a father lay, upon whom a numerous"
8980,WITHERED LEAVES.,family were dependant. Thou wast there; thy icy breath was upon him;
8981,WITHERED LEAVES.,thy agonizing throes were depicted on his pallid countenance; his
8982,WITHERED LEAVES.,expansive chest heaved laboriously; his shortening breath came up
8983,WITHERED LEAVES.,"convulsively, and his eyes seemed starting from their sockets. He had"
8984,WITHERED LEAVES.,been called suddenly--unexpectedly to meet thee. A tearful wife and
8985,WITHERED LEAVES.,"children gathered around the bed, formed an interesting group, and"
8986,WITHERED LEAVES.,strove in vain to allay the agony of the husband and father. But a
8987,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sterner blow, and that wife was a widow, those children fatherless."
8988,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Thou hadst taken that father to ""that undiscovered country from whose"
8989,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bourne no traveler e'er returns."" That weeping wife and those children"
8990,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""were cast abandoned on the world's wide stage, doomed in scanty"
8991,WITHERED LEAVES.,"poverty to roam."" But still I followed thee, thou fell destroyer of the"

8993,WITHERED LEAVES.,
8994,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A gentle mother next received thy visitation, falling a prey to thy"

8996,WITHERED LEAVES.,day by day she ministered to their necessities. The rose had long
8997,WITHERED LEAVES.,"since faded from her cheek; an unwonted lustre lit up her eye, and her"
8998,WITHERED LEAVES.,"step became more and more feeble, 'till thou didst summon her away,"
8999,WITHERED LEAVES.,leaving a void in the hearts of those children that can never be
9000,WITHERED LEAVES.,"filled. Sad, sickening was the sight as I followed in thy train, and"
9001,WITHERED LEAVES.,"saw father, mother, sister, brother, and all the endearing relations"
9002,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of life, fall before thy sway. But thou art coeval with the race;"
9003,WITHERED LEAVES.,there lives not a man who will not bow before thy sceptre; all must
9004,WITHERED LEAVES.,drink from thy cup. The crowned monarch and the beggar sleep side by

9115,WITHERED LEAVES.,And drooped their lowly heads;
9116,WITHERED LEAVES.,"While out, upon the evening air,"
9117,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A grateful incense, rich and rare,"

9119,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9120,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The green trees seemed to tower on high,"

9123,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The noiseless shadows came and went,"
9124,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Waver'd and glanced, and graceful bent,"
9125,WITHERED LEAVES.,Like champions in fight.
9126,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9127,WITHERED LEAVES.,"There was a little, fragrant bower,"
9128,WITHERED LEAVES.,"That nature, in some sportive hour,"
9129,WITHERED LEAVES.,Had gracefully arrayed;
9130,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And overgrown with creeping vines,"
9131,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Their tendrils with the green bows twined,"

9133,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9134,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As near this fairy bower I drew,"
9135,WITHERED LEAVES.,"An object met my startled view,"
9136,WITHERED LEAVES.,Entrancing all my powers;
9137,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A fair young girl was kneeling there,"
9138,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Her white hands clasped in fervent prayer,--"
9139,WITHERED LEAVES.,Her dark hair wreathed with flowers.
9140,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9141,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Meekly her eyes to heav'n were turned,"
9142,WITHERED LEAVES.,While in her trusting heart there burned
9143,WITHERED LEAVES.,The fire of holy love;
9144,WITHERED LEAVES.,"So fair, so heavenly, looked her face,"
9145,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Less seemed she one of mortal race,"
9146,WITHERED LEAVES.,Than angel from above.
9147,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9148,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was a lovely, starry night,"
9149,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And softly in the silver light,"
9150,WITHERED LEAVES.,Did flickering shadows fall;
9151,WITHERED LEAVES.,And bright the flowers that blossomed there;
9152,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But the incense of that maiden's prayer,"
9153,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Was purer, far, than all."
9154,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9155,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The sweetest sight below the skies,--"

9166,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9167,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9168,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Oh, wherefore ask a song of me;"
9169,WITHERED LEAVES.,Romance within my heart is dead;
9170,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Hush'd is my spirit's minstrelsy,"
9171,WITHERED LEAVES.,Youth's golden visions all have fled.
9172,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9173,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Life's rainbow hues have pass'd away,"
9174,WITHERED LEAVES.,With clearer vision now I see;
9175,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And I more deeply feel each day,"
9176,WITHERED LEAVES.,That life's a stern reality.
9177,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9178,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It is no dream, or fairy tale,"
9179,WITHERED LEAVES.,Or minstrel's strain of music rare;
9180,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But ever foremost in its train,"

9182,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9183,WITHERED LEAVES.,"We may not linger by the way,"

9187,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9188,WITHERED LEAVES.,Yet there's within each heart a chord
9189,WITHERED LEAVES.,That vibrates with a music tone;
9190,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Duty performed brings its reward,"
9191,WITHERED LEAVES.,We live not for ourselves alone.
9192,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9193,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Life has a higher, nobler aim,"
9194,WITHERED LEAVES.,A destiny beyond earth's toys;
9195,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A richer heritage we claim,"
9196,WITHERED LEAVES.,A title to celestial joys.
9197,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9198,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then upward look, with firm resolve,"
9199,WITHERED LEAVES.,Thy spirit's precious plume to rise;

9242,WITHERED LEAVES.,On wings of Faith beyond the skies.
9243,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9244,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I linger but a little space,"
9245,WITHERED LEAVES.,To gaze upon my husband's face;
9246,WITHERED LEAVES.,"My gentle infant's lips to press,"

9512,WITHERED LEAVES.,The Power of Custom.
9513,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9514,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9515,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Custom is a despotic tyrant, wielding an iron sceptre over man,"
9516,WITHERED LEAVES.,before whose unbounded sway unnumbered millions hourly bend. We are
9517,WITHERED LEAVES.,"controlled by its influence from earliest infancy to latest age, even"
9518,WITHERED LEAVES.,from the making of an infant's frock to the shroud. In early youth
9519,WITHERED LEAVES.,"we must go to this school, or that lecture, or to that resort of"
9520,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fashionable amusement, because others go, and it is the custom."
9521,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9522,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It seems strange that custom should hold such a dominion over us--we,"
9523,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the people of this enlightened age, be bound to such a tyrant! it"
9524,WITHERED LEAVES.,"seems almost impossible, but so it is. We see it in the professional"
9525,WITHERED LEAVES.,"man, the man of business, and men in all grades of society, and from"
9526,WITHERED LEAVES.,the lady at her toilet to the factory operative. We must have our
9527,WITHERED LEAVES.,"clothing cut after such a style, and wear it after such a manner; and"
9528,WITHERED LEAVES.,"why? O, it is the custom. It is too much the custom for people to look"
9529,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with contempt upon those who have not quite so good advantages, or"
9530,WITHERED LEAVES.,"more especially, those who have not so much wealth, without regard to"
9531,WITHERED LEAVES.,intellect or education.
9532,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9533,WITHERED LEAVES.,Custom has introduced into society vices of all descriptions. Not long
9534,WITHERED LEAVES.,"since it was the custom to pass the social glass, and it has been the"
9535,WITHERED LEAVES.,"means of making a great many inebriates, and making beggars of a great"
9536,WITHERED LEAVES.,many families; thus we see the effects of that custom. The custom of
9537,WITHERED LEAVES.,"revelry, balls, parties, and gay assemblies, tend to dissipate the"
9538,WITHERED LEAVES.,"minds of youth, and lead them into the paths of vice. The custom"
9539,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of card-playing has led to the gaming-table, and been the ruin of"
9540,WITHERED LEAVES.,thousands.

9552,WITHERED LEAVES.,Annie Howard.
9553,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9554,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9555,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was a chill, dreary day in November. The autumn winds swept with"
9556,WITHERED LEAVES.,a dirge-like sound through the tops of the tall old trees that
9557,WITHERED LEAVES.,"overshadowed a stately mansion, where a group of sorrowing friends"
9558,WITHERED LEAVES.,"had collected, to pay the last sad rite, to one of earth's fairest,"
9559,WITHERED LEAVES.,loveliest flowers. All without wore an air of gloom and melancholy.
9560,WITHERED LEAVES.,Ever and anon a sere and yellow leaf would fall with a faint rustling
9561,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sound, speaking in mournful language to the heart, that all things"
9562,WITHERED LEAVES.,earthly must decay; and well did the scene accord with the sadness and
9563,WITHERED LEAVES.,sorrow that reigned in the hearts of those who had assembled on that
9564,WITHERED LEAVES.,mournful occasion.
9565,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9566,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The deceased was one whom we had all known and loved, for she was one"
9567,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of those sweet angelic beings, whom it is impossible not to love. Her"
9568,WITHERED LEAVES.,"presence, like sunshine, seemed to diffuse light and cheerfullness"
9569,WITHERED LEAVES.,upon all who came within the magic circle of her influence.
9570,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9571,WITHERED LEAVES.,Her glad laugh fell like music upon the ear. Her large dark eyes
9572,WITHERED LEAVES.,beamed with the light of intelligence and affection. The softest rose
9573,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tint tinged her alabaster cheek, and the tones of her voice were like"
9574,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the melody of an Aeolian harp, when touched by the wandering zephyrs."
9575,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9576,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But youth, beauty, and goodness could not shield her from the cruel"
9577,WITHERED LEAVES.,"shafts of the destroyer. The hand of disease fell heavily upon her,"
9578,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and her fragile form sank beneath the blow, and faded like a blighted"
9579,WITHERED LEAVES.,"flower. There sat her parents bowed down by grief, for the being whom"
9580,WITHERED LEAVES.,"they most loved on earth, the light of their home, the joy, the hope,"
9581,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the pride of their hearts, had been taken from them, and they were"
9582,WITHERED LEAVES.,indeed left desolate.
9583,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9584,WITHERED LEAVES.,One ray of light alone illumined the darkness that overshadowed them
9585,WITHERED LEAVES.,like a pall. But one star shone out upon the dim horizon of the
9586,WITHERED LEAVES.,"future, the hope of being reunited with their beloved child in that"
9587,WITHERED LEAVES.,"better land, where tears shall be wiped from all eyes--where love"
9588,WITHERED LEAVES.,"never dies, and parting scenes are never known."
9589,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9590,WITHERED LEAVES.,The funeral services were performed in a solemn and impressive manner.
9591,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The coffin was then opened, and one by one we approached to take the"
9592,WITHERED LEAVES.,"last fond look of its frail tenant. Oh, could it be that that form, so"
9593,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cold and motionless, clad in the white habiliments of the grave, was"
9594,WITHERED LEAVES.,that of the once lovely and fascinating Annie Howard? Were those lips
9595,WITHERED LEAVES.,that were wont to entrance with their melody forever sealed in death?
9596,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Would those eyes never again beam with the light of affection, or"
9597,WITHERED LEAVES.,"kindle with the glow of enthusiasm? Oh, how forcibly were we reminded"
9598,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that ""passing away"" is written upon all things here below, and that"
9599,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the fairest forms that walk the earth, in all the pride of beauty,"
9600,WITHERED LEAVES.,"must go down to the dark, cold grave, to be food for the loathesome"
9601,WITHERED LEAVES.,"worm. With slow and faltering steps, and with tear-suffused eyes,"
9602,WITHERED LEAVES.,"we followed the remains to the narrow house, appointed for all the"
9603,WITHERED LEAVES.,"living; and then mournfully returned to our homes, to muse upon the"
9604,WITHERED LEAVES.,"uncertainty, and the perishable nature of all earthly joys."
9605,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9606,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie Howard was one of my earliest and dearest friends, and thinking"
9607,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that, perhaps, her history might be interesting to some who may chance"
9608,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to peruse these pages, I have endeavored, although but imperfectly, to"
9609,WITHERED LEAVES.,give a brief sketch of her life.
9610,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9611,WITHERED LEAVES.,She was the only child of wealthy and highly respectable parents.
9612,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Possessed of refined and cultivated minds, they were anxious that"
9613,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their daughter should be educated in all the more solid branches,"
9614,WITHERED LEAVES.,"which would render her a useful member of society, as well as the"
9615,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lighter graces and accomplishments which, too often, in the present"
9616,WITHERED LEAVES.,"day, supercede the cultivation of the mind. Endowed with a brilliant"
9617,WITHERED LEAVES.,"intellect, she excelled in whatever she attempted, and the fond"
9618,WITHERED LEAVES.,anticipations of her friends were more than realized. The acquirement
9619,WITHERED LEAVES.,of literature was to her a source of exquisite delight. Her thirsty
9620,WITHERED LEAVES.,"soul drank at the fountain of knowledge, with as much avidity as the"
9621,WITHERED LEAVES.,"weary traveller slakes his thirst at the fountain of cool waters, that"
9622,WITHERED LEAVES.,bubbles up in the midst of the sandy desert. Her inquiring mind was
9623,WITHERED LEAVES.,never weary of exploring the deep mysteries of science or poring over
9624,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the pages of ancient lore. Music, painting and poetry seemed to form"
9625,WITHERED LEAVES.,the etherial essence of her mind. She played with exquisite skill and
9626,WITHERED LEAVES.,"taste, and sang with surpassing sweetness and melody."
9627,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9628,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Her brilliant powers of mind, the beauty of her person, her graceful,"
9629,WITHERED LEAVES.,"winning manners, the sweetness of her disposition, and the unaffected"
9630,WITHERED LEAVES.,"goodness of her heart, rendered her a universal favorite in the circle"
9631,WITHERED LEAVES.,in which she moved.
9632,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9633,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Yet, was she ever modest and unassuming. She was far from that"
9634,WITHERED LEAVES.,vain haughtiness that is the common characteristic of narrow and
9635,WITHERED LEAVES.,"superficial minds, and which, too often, displays itself in persons of"
9636,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cultivated intellect, where there is not a corresponding goodness"
9637,WITHERED LEAVES.,of heart. It seemed to be her aim to render those with whom she
9638,WITHERED LEAVES.,"associated, pleased with themselves rather than to impress upon them"
9639,WITHERED LEAVES.,a sense of her own superiority. This trait in her character had in it
9640,WITHERED LEAVES.,"nothing allied to sycophancy, which quickly disgusts persons of sense"
9641,WITHERED LEAVES.,and refinement; neither did it originate merely in the desire to
9642,WITHERED LEAVES.,"please, but had its source in an inherent principle of her nature,"
9643,WITHERED LEAVES.,which prompted her to seek to promote the happiness of others.
9644,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9645,WITHERED LEAVES.,"She possessed an intuitive knowledge of human nature, which, together"
9646,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with her extreme delicacy, with regard to the feelings of others,"
9647,WITHERED LEAVES.,formed the keystone which unlocked to her the secret recesses of
9648,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hearts, which, to a less careless observer, would have been veiled in"
9649,WITHERED LEAVES.,impenetrable coldness and reserve.
9650,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9651,WITHERED LEAVES.,"In early life she had given her heart to the Saviour, and had"
9652,WITHERED LEAVES.,consecrated herself to the service of God; and she sought to follow
9653,WITHERED LEAVES.,the example of the meek and lowly Jesus.
9654,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9655,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The poor, the sick, and the sorrowful, were objects of her peculiar"
9656,WITHERED LEAVES.,"care and attention. Many a poor, crushed and broken-hearted being,"
9657,WITHERED LEAVES.,"borne down by poverty and affliction, was made glad by her sympathy"
9658,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and kindness. She possessed that sweet, graceful way of offering a"
9659,WITHERED LEAVES.,benefit which rendered a favor from her doubly acceptable. Among the
9660,WITHERED LEAVES.,"gentlemen of her acquaintance, there were many who, fascinated by the"
9661,WITHERED LEAVES.,"charms both of her mind and person, sought to win her heart, but of"
9662,WITHERED LEAVES.,"all her numerous admirers, there was but one whose affection was"
9663,WITHERED LEAVES.,"reciprocated, and that one was well worthy the love and confidence of"
9664,WITHERED LEAVES.,such a being as Annie Howard. He possessed those noble qualities of
9665,WITHERED LEAVES.,"heart and mind which command the admiration of the great and good, and"
9666,WITHERED LEAVES.,"which render man, in the true sense of the term, the noblest work of"
9667,WITHERED LEAVES.,"God. Gifted with strong powers of mind, which had been disciplined"
9668,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by a thorough education, possessing principles of the strictest"
9669,WITHERED LEAVES.,"integrity, and an elegant and prepossessing exterior, he was beloved"
9670,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and esteemed by all who knew him. He was a physician, and had the"
9671,WITHERED LEAVES.,reputation of being a skilful practitioner. He had resided in the same
9672,WITHERED LEAVES.,"village with Annie some two or three years, and being of congenial"
9673,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dispositions, and thrown much into each others' society, a strong"
9674,WITHERED LEAVES.,"attachment had sprung up between them, which was sanctioned by the"
9675,WITHERED LEAVES.,friends of both parties.
9676,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9677,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But brilliant intellect, beauty of person, sweetness of disposition,"
9678,WITHERED LEAVES.,"goodness of heart, nor love of friends could save her from death's"
9679,WITHERED LEAVES.,"relentless dart. In her case, the words of the poet Wordsworth were"
9680,WITHERED LEAVES.,"verrified,"
9681,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9682,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""The good die first,"
9683,WITHERED LEAVES.,And they whose hearts are dry as summer dust
9684,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Burn to the socket."""
9685,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9686,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Ere nineteen summers had passed over her head, consumption had"
9687,WITHERED LEAVES.,fastened upon her vitals. At first the symptoms were so slight that
9688,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her friends felt little alarm, but soon the hollow cough, which sounds"
9689,WITHERED LEAVES.,"so much like a funeral knell, the unnatural brilliancy of the eye, the"
9690,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hectic glow upon the cheek, and the short, labored breathing, told but"
9691,WITHERED LEAVES.,too plainly that death was not to be cheated of his prey. It has been
9692,WITHERED LEAVES.,"said that death loves a shining mark, and it is true that he often"
9693,WITHERED LEAVES.,"passes by the loathsome form, shriveled by age, and want, and"
9694,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lingering disease, to feast upon the sparkling eye, the ruby lips, and"
9695,WITHERED LEAVES.,glowing cheek of youth and beauty.
9696,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9697,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Annie soon became fully sensible that she was not long for this world,"
9698,WITHERED LEAVES.,but was perfectly calm and resigned. She possessed that hope that
9699,WITHERED LEAVES.,"alone can sustain the soul in sickness and suffering, when we feel"
9700,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that our hold upon earth is each day growing weaker, and eternity,"
9701,WITHERED LEAVES.,"vast, boundless, with all its untried scenes, with all its deep"
9702,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mysteries, and overwhelming interests, lies stretched out before us,"
9703,WITHERED LEAVES.,when the soul feels that it must soon be called upon to enter upon
9704,WITHERED LEAVES.,"those untried scenes, and to fathom the deep mysteries of that endless"
9705,WITHERED LEAVES.,"existence, and that it must go alone and unattended into the presence"
9706,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of its Maker, there to render up its account. She felt that, although"
9707,WITHERED LEAVES.,"she was unworthy of God's favor, yet Christ had shed his blood for"
9708,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her, and she trusted that her sins had been washed away by that blood,"
9709,WITHERED LEAVES.,and her soul made meet for the heavenly inheritance. She strove to
9710,WITHERED LEAVES.,"console the grief of her parents, who were almost heartbroken at the"
9711,WITHERED LEAVES.,thought of parting from their child. She pointed them to that home
9712,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beyond the grave, where they should be reunited never more to part;"
9713,WITHERED LEAVES.,"never more to suffer pain, or sorrow, or care; where tears are wiped"
9714,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from all eyes, and the ransomed spirit will be permitted to join with"
9715,WITHERED LEAVES.,the heavenly host in singing praises to the Redeemer.
9716,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9717,WITHERED LEAVES.,She bore her sufferings with sweet resignation. As her bodily strength
9718,WITHERED LEAVES.,"failed her mind seemed to expand, and her intellectual powers to grow"
9719,WITHERED LEAVES.,higher. Her love of the beautiful seemed also to increase. The deep
9720,WITHERED LEAVES.,"blue sky, when studded by a countless host of brilliant stars; the"
9721,WITHERED LEAVES.,"soft, fleecy clouds when reflecting the gorgeous hues of sunset; the"
9722,WITHERED LEAVES.,"music of the birds; the whispering of the breeze, making mysterious"
9723,WITHERED LEAVES.,"melody as it mingled with the rustling of the leaves; these, with a"
9724,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thousand other sweet but incomprehensible charms of nature, seemed to"
9725,WITHERED LEAVES.,form the link that bound her soul to earth.
9726,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9727,WITHERED LEAVES.,Gradually her strength failed; each day her fragile form became more
9728,WITHERED LEAVES.,"attenuated, and her thin hand more transparent. There was nothing"
9729,WITHERED LEAVES.,terrible in the approach of death. Nothing that was revolting to the
9730,WITHERED LEAVES.,most sensitive mind; but when we were summoned to stand around her
9731,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dying bed, there was something so calm, so heavenly, so peaceful, in"
9732,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the expression of her countenance, that we all felt that it was indeed"
9733,WITHERED LEAVES.,a privilege to witness the departure of her soul to the world of
9734,WITHERED LEAVES.,"spirits, and we involuntarily exclaimed, ""Let me die the death of the"
9735,WITHERED LEAVES.,"righteous, and let my last end be like his."""

9816,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Well, here I am, sitting down with inkstand, pen and paper all before"

9818,WITHERED LEAVES.,"drawn from the resources of the mind, and portrayed upon the unsullied"
9819,WITHERED LEAVES.,"page. The mind, that mysterious, unfathomable, undying, immortal part"
9820,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of man; that immaterial essence, which contemplates upon past and"
9821,WITHERED LEAVES.,"future scenes, from which emanates all our thoughts and passions--and"
9822,WITHERED LEAVES.,"all our happiness or misery. If we would have our composition correct,"
9823,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the mind must be well cultivated, for that, like a well cultivated"
9824,WITHERED LEAVES.,"garden, will produce fine fruit and beautiful flowers, where no noxous"
9825,WITHERED LEAVES.,"weed should be allowed to intrude, or delicate plant wither and die"

9839,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to nature's God, the maker and former of them all."
9840,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9841,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Composition is said to be the index of the mind, if so, how necessary"
9842,WITHERED LEAVES.,"it is that there should be no improper word or idea expressed, no blot"
9843,WITHERED LEAVES.,or tarnish should be upon the fair page; how chaste and elegant should
9844,WITHERED LEAVES.,"be the diction, how pure and refined the idea, how simple and concise"
9845,WITHERED LEAVES.,the expression. It should be like the glassy lake that reflects an
9846,WITHERED LEAVES.,unclouded sky--the mirror of a spotless mind.

9870,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And murmuring through the evening air,"
9871,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Echo only answered, ""where?"""
9872,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I thought I'd chase my fears away,"

9885,WITHERED LEAVES.,"In looking over the foregoing pages, I feel that sad indeed have been"
9886,WITHERED LEAVES.,my wanderings in the shady paths of life. The aged friends of my
9887,WITHERED LEAVES.,childhood have been buried over again. The last sad parting from many
9888,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dear friends has been noted down; the deaths of sister, brother and"
9889,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mother, have been noticed in sad rotation; grand-children have sprung"
9890,WITHERED LEAVES.,"up, beside the way, flourished for a little season, then faded like"
9891,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the pale, withering leaves of autumn, and passed away from earth"
9892,WITHERED LEAVES.,forever.
9893,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9894,WITHERED LEAVES.,"O, Memory, thy garland has indeed been entwined, with many a withered"

9897,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9898,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But there is a deeper shadow, a gloomier shade, a sadder spot upon"
9899,WITHERED LEAVES.,"earth, than we have yet visited. It is the recently made grave of my"
9900,WITHERED LEAVES.,"husband--the father of my children, who passed suddenly away, leaving"
9901,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his afflicted family, bereft of his counsel, his watch care, and his"
9902,WITHERED LEAVES.,support.
9903,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9904,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As I stand in this sad spot, and gaze upon that lone grave, with"
9905,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tearful eyes and a bursting heart, memory comes like a tide, throwing"
9906,WITHERED LEAVES.,over my soul the remembrances of the many--many years we have
9907,WITHERED LEAVES.,"journeyed on together, since our first acquaintance in academic"
9908,WITHERED LEAVES.,"halls (for our intimacy first commenced in school), and all the sad"
9909,WITHERED LEAVES.,"loneliness of the present presses like a weight upon me, crushing me"
9910,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to the earth, and obscuring all the sunshine of earthly bliss."
9911,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9912,WITHERED LEAVES.,How sad and desolate is the home from which some loved one has been
9913,WITHERED LEAVES.,"borne suddenly away, with the firm assurance that ""the places that"
9914,WITHERED LEAVES.,"once knew them shall know them no more forever."""
9915,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9916,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The vacant seat at table, the return of their usual hour of arrival,"
9917,WITHERED LEAVES.,"all places and all things remind us of the departed one, and bring"
9918,WITHERED LEAVES.,"up harrowing remembrances of the past, that add deeper pangs to our"
9919,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sorrow, and fill our hearts with more unendurable anguish, and suffuse"
9920,WITHERED LEAVES.,"our cheeks with more scalding tears, as the stern reality presses upon"
9921,WITHERED LEAVES.,"us, that it always must be thus."
9922,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9923,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Companion of my youth, can it be possible thy manly form is hid"
9924,WITHERED LEAVES.,beneath this grassy mound at my feet? that I never again shall hear
9925,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the sound of that voice, whose endearing tone won me to thy side,"
9926,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to unite my destiny with thine, and float with thee over life's"
9927,WITHERED LEAVES.,tempestous ocean?
9928,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9929,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Rough, indeed, has been the passage, and many the adverse storms we"
9930,WITHERED LEAVES.,"have encountered, during our thirty-two years companionship, and now,"
9931,WITHERED LEAVES.,"way-worn and weary, the grave--the greedy grave claims thee for its"
9932,WITHERED LEAVES.,"occupant. How sweet is the assurance ""that the graves shall give up"
9933,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their dead, and this mortal shall put on immortality."" Yes, this dear"
9934,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dust shall rise again, and be clothed in undying youth."
9935,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9936,WITHERED LEAVES.,"O, how stealthily the stern messenger came, laying low the form of the"
9937,WITHERED LEAVES.,"strong man, ere we were aware of his danger. One week--one short week,"
9938,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and yet to him a week of agonizing suffering, and all was over. Yet,"
9939,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in that week, what a volume might be written, of deep, intense"
9940,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thought and feeling, of fervent prayer and supplication, and tearful,"
9941,WITHERED LEAVES.,childlike submission to the divine will. Might be written did I say?
9942,WITHERED LEAVES.,Is it not written--even in the book of God's remembrance? Neither sigh
9943,WITHERED LEAVES.,"or tear were unnoticed, or prayer unheard, by that God who careth for"
9944,WITHERED LEAVES.,"us, and numbereth the very hairs of our heads. How often the prayer"
9945,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ascended from the lips of the dying man, ""O my Father, help me in this"
9946,WITHERED LEAVES.,"my extremity,"" and it was indeed his hour of extreme necessity, for he"
9947,WITHERED LEAVES.,was wrestling with his last enemy.
9948,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9949,WITHERED LEAVES.,"A smile sat upon his countenance, even while struggling for that frail"
9950,WITHERED LEAVES.,"life that was so soon to end, and it is now very evident to those"
9951,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that were in attendance upon him, that he was more fully aware of his"
9952,WITHERED LEAVES.,situation than they. Every arrangement and every observation plainly
9953,WITHERED LEAVES.,"shows now that he had little, if any hope of recovery."
9954,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9955,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But still the attending physician spoke very encouragingly to him, and"
9956,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to others, and so we hoped and believed he would yet be well."
9957,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9958,WITHERED LEAVES.,He was grateful for every attention. Ere the disease (which was
9959,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pneumonia) assumed its most fearful aspect; a daughter, who was"
9960,WITHERED LEAVES.,"watching by the bed, hearing him whisper, thought he was addressing"
9961,WITHERED LEAVES.,"her; but bending over the pillow, she heard him say,"
9962,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9963,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""Oh, my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me."""
9964,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9965,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then raising his clasped hands, said, fervently, ""Nevertheless, not my"
9966,WITHERED LEAVES.,"will, but thine be done."" Towards morning, reason became dethroned,"
9967,WITHERED LEAVES.,and the bewildered imagination wandered in the land of shadows. There
9968,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was an extremely anxious expression of countenance, and he would look"
9969,WITHERED LEAVES.,"earnestly upon his attendants, as though he thought we could relieve"
9970,WITHERED LEAVES.,him. He was incessantly springing from his bed in his struggles for
9971,WITHERED LEAVES.,"breath, and trying every new position that the extremity of his case"
9972,WITHERED LEAVES.,"could possibly suggest, but all to no avail."
9973,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9974,WITHERED LEAVES.,But why dwell upon the fearful scene? We have seen the little child
9975,WITHERED LEAVES.,"contending with the strong arm of the destroyer, and felt it was a"
9976,WITHERED LEAVES.,fearful thing for it to yield up its little life and pass forever away
9977,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from earth. But when we see the strong man cut suddenly down, the man"
9978,WITHERED LEAVES.,"who has scarcely passed the meridian of life, we ""feel how dreadful"
9979,WITHERED LEAVES.,"'tis to die."" The love of life is strengthened by years. There are"
9980,WITHERED LEAVES.,"cords of association binding him to it, the rolling, restless tide of"
9981,WITHERED LEAVES.,"business, with its fluctuations and its cares, sweeps over him, and"
9982,WITHERED LEAVES.,"seems binding him to earth. The love of children, for whose welfare a"
9983,WITHERED LEAVES.,"kind father has so long been mindful, and all the fond endearments of"
9984,WITHERED LEAVES.,"home and kindred, are so many sacred ties binding him to life. But all"
9985,WITHERED LEAVES.,"must be severed before the ruthless tyrant who conquers conquerers,"
9986,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and has justly been styled, ""the king of terrors."""
9987,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9988,WITHERED LEAVES.,And so it was in this case. Nature yielded reluctantly every advantage
9989,WITHERED LEAVES.,"gained by the fearful foe, 'till her energies were exhausted, and"
9990,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sinking down in quiet slumber, she yielded the contest without a"
9991,WITHERED LEAVES.,struggle.
9992,WITHERED LEAVES.,
9993,WITHERED LEAVES.,"About eight o'clock on Thursday evening, a heavy stupor came over him,"
9994,WITHERED LEAVES.,and the fearful death-rattle warned us of the approach of the grim
9995,WITHERED LEAVES.,messenger. We watched his failing breath with agonizing emotions. But
9996,WITHERED LEAVES.,"we turned from him one little moment, and when we turned again, the"
9997,WITHERED LEAVES.,"lamp of life was extinguished. O, the fearful agonizing cry that arose"
9998,WITHERED LEAVES.,"by that death bed, when we realized that the husband and father had"
9999,WITHERED LEAVES.,"passed away, forever away. But while we wept and mourned, he slept on"
10000,WITHERED LEAVES.,"unheeding. Death made little change in his countenance, and when he"
10001,WITHERED LEAVES.,"was dressed in his accustomed clothing, and laid in his coffin, he"
10002,WITHERED LEAVES.,looked like a weary man taking rest in sleep.
10003,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10004,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was a pleasant day in mid April that we bore him to his grave, and"
10005,WITHERED LEAVES.,laid him down beneath the green branches of the arbor vitae tree. How
10006,WITHERED LEAVES.,"many mournful thoughts pressed upon the heart, almost crushing out the"
10007,WITHERED LEAVES.,"very life, as the mournful train followed him to that sacred spot. Who"
10008,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that has looked into an open grave, and seen the coffin of the dearly"
10009,WITHERED LEAVES.,"loved lowered into it, but has felt an indiscribable agony filling the"
10010,WITHERED LEAVES.,"heart, and blotting out all the prospect of future earthly happiness?"
10011,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And who that listens to the sound of the heavy, damp earth as it falls"
10012,WITHERED LEAVES.,"upon the coffin, but will say, ""oh, has earth another sound like"
10013,WITHERED LEAVES.,"this?"" And there we left the husband and the father reposing beneath"
10014,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the tree his own hand had trained, and in the yard where he had spent"
10015,WITHERED LEAVES.,so many hours laboring to beautify the spot where he was so soon to
10016,WITHERED LEAVES.,lie down in his last long sleep. By his side are the graves of the two
10017,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dear grand-children, who were wont to share in his caresses, and his"
10018,WITHERED LEAVES.,"smiles. Silent now is their greeting, as the weary grandfather lays"
10019,WITHERED LEAVES.,down with them in the place of graves: But eternity! oh eternity!
10020,WITHERED LEAVES.,"how is the meeting there? Have they met? There are father, mother,"
10021,WITHERED LEAVES.,"brothers, sister, and a long train of relatives from whom he has"
10022,WITHERED LEAVES.,"been long separated. Have they recognized each other? O, bewildering"
10023,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thoughts, be still, and cease your restless longings; ""secret things"
10024,WITHERED LEAVES.,"belong to God,"" and ""what we know not now we shall know hereafter."""
10025,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But now, while the soft winds of summer are gently sighing through the"
10026,WITHERED LEAVES.,branches of the arbor vitae tree that stands at the head of the grassy
10027,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mound that rises over the form of my buried husband, I see by his"
10028,WITHERED LEAVES.,"side, the spot where, in all human probability, this frame will soon"
10029,WITHERED LEAVES.,"be deposited, to sleep with him in death's silent halls, even as I"
10030,WITHERED LEAVES.,"have journeyed with him through life. 'Till then, let me turn to"
10031,WITHERED LEAVES.,"my mission, and endeavor by a faithful discharge of every duty,"
10032,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to prepare for that time, and strive by a holy life and godly"
10033,WITHERED LEAVES.,"conversation, to so influence my children, that they may all seek a"
10034,WITHERED LEAVES.,"city not made with hands eternal, and in the heavens. And thus shall"
10035,WITHERED LEAVES.,"be answered my daily prayer, that we may be a united family in heaven."
10036,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10037,WITHERED LEAVES.,So we returned to the house beneath the mild radiance of a Sabbath
10038,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sun, to experience that awful void that death makes in the domestic"
10039,WITHERED LEAVES.,circle to which so many bereaved hearts can respond.

10116,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10117,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10118,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Conscience, and what is conscience? Is it not that silent but powerful"
10119,WITHERED LEAVES.,monitor within that weighs our every motive? is it not the small still
10120,WITHERED LEAVES.,"voice that whispers its approval when we have acted right, but bursts"
10121,WITHERED LEAVES.,"like the crashing thunder peal or the terrific earthquake, when we"
10122,WITHERED LEAVES.,have acted wrong? She stands with extended finger a silent though
10123,WITHERED LEAVES.,"faithful friend, and points us onward in the plain path of duty. We"
10124,WITHERED LEAVES.,"have only to follow her dictates, and all will be well. But many gaudy"
10125,WITHERED LEAVES.,"flowers are blooming here and there beside the path, to tempt the"
10126,WITHERED LEAVES.,thoughtless one to step aside and pluck; but though they are beautiful
10127,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to the eye, and their fragrance borne to us by the breeze, seems to"
10128,WITHERED LEAVES.,"woo us temptingly, yet, concealed within their leaves is a deadly"
10129,WITHERED LEAVES.,"scorpion or poisonous asp, whose sting is instant death, or some,"
10130,WITHERED LEAVES.,"perhaps, contain a more slow and sluggish poison, that creeps into the"
10131,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mind, and instilling its venom by slow degrees, corrupts the whole."
10132,WITHERED LEAVES.,Conscience has well been called the tell tale of our breasts.

10137,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to side beneath her lash, and see his victim for the thousandth time"
10138,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in the agonies of death; over and over again, she acts the bloody"
10139,WITHERED LEAVES.,"scene, and, while he turns restless and feverish upon his pillow,"
10140,WITHERED LEAVES.,"still holds the picture bleeding fresh to fancy's wearied gaze, and as"
10141,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in Macbeth, presents the dagger, while ""on its blade and bludgeon are"
10142,WITHERED LEAVES.,"drops of blood that were not so before."" Crimes of dye not so deep,"
10143,WITHERED LEAVES.,"are conjured up to harrow up the breast and rack the brain, and render"

10145,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10146,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Truly she is placed within us as a friend, warning us of danger and"

10183,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10184,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10185,WITHERED LEAVES.,"_Pawtucket, June_ 20, 1852."
10186,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10187,WITHERED LEAVES.,Mrs. M. M. Bucklin:
10188,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10189,WITHERED LEAVES.,"My daughter in affliction, I would that, like Paul on Mars Hill, I"
10190,WITHERED LEAVES.,"could enter at once, with eloquence and persuasion, on a subject that"
10191,WITHERED LEAVES.,might have the influence of restoring or bringing back your natural
10192,WITHERED LEAVES.,buoyancy and elasticity of spirit. I need not tell you that I feel
10193,WITHERED LEAVES.,"earnestly, sensibly and deeply for you; and any mortal effort or"
10194,WITHERED LEAVES.,sacrifice within my power should not be wanting to effect an object so
10195,WITHERED LEAVES.,"desirable by your friends. But Malvina, an arm of flesh is not to"
10196,WITHERED LEAVES.,be relied upon; no human ken can reach the mysterious windings and
10197,WITHERED LEAVES.,wonderful intricacies of a mother's love for her offspring. That
10198,WITHERED LEAVES.,"is, as yet, the unrevealed handiwork of Omnipotence, who in wisdom"
10199,WITHERED LEAVES.,"conceived the beautiful mechanism, and brought to perfection the"
10200,WITHERED LEAVES.,"refinements of our nature; and to his almighty fiat are we indebted,"
10201,WITHERED LEAVES.,both for the boon of death and the glorious hope of the resurrection.
10202,WITHERED LEAVES.,How peculiarly adapted to our consolation is the doctrine of the
10203,WITHERED LEAVES.,resurrection. The angel of mercy has withdrawn from your boson a
10204,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beloved child. O, how sweet the consolation of hope through the very"
10205,WITHERED LEAVES.,"life-giving words of Him who cannot lie, as so beautifully and so"
10206,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tenderly expressed to Martha, ""Thy brother shall rise again."" And, my"
10207,WITHERED LEAVES.,"daughter, be assured that your little Emma shall rise again, for said"
10208,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the same Almighty Comforter, ""of such is the Kingdom of Heaven."""
10209,WITHERED LEAVES.,Therefore it would be wise in us not to sorrow for her who is asleep.
10210,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I know you believe that Jesus died and rose again. And so, also, of"
10211,WITHERED LEAVES.,"them who sleep in Jesus, will God bring with him."
10212,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10213,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The question by the afflicted man of Uz might once, with some degree"
10214,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of propriety have been asked, ""If a man die shall he live again?"""
10215,WITHERED LEAVES.,"But we believe in the resurrection of the dead, because He who"
10216,WITHERED LEAVES.,"has promised is able to perform, and no science however new, nor"
10217,WITHERED LEAVES.,"speculation however magnificent, should be allowed to rob us of this"
10218,WITHERED LEAVES.,beautiful and life-giving hope. I know that it is hard for us to
10219,WITHERED LEAVES.,concieve the mighty power of transformation or to demonstrate the
10220,WITHERED LEAVES.,"great principle of a spiritual ascension from our decayed bodies, of"
10221,WITHERED LEAVES.,"those seraphic hosts, who are to stand as ministering angels around"
10222,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the majesty of Heaven, through all the never ending cycles of"
10223,WITHERED LEAVES.,"eternity, no matter what objections skepticism may urge of the"
10224,WITHERED LEAVES.,impossibility of conceiving how the dead can be raised up to a newness
10225,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of life. Our faith receives it as a revealed fact, and our hearts"
10226,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rejoice in the glorious hope, because we know that our Redeemer"
10227,WITHERED LEAVES.,"liveth, and that he will again stand upon this earth. And though these"
10228,WITHERED LEAVES.,"our frail bodies may be destroyed by death, yet shall we see God."
10229,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Marvellous as may be the transition, at death and the resurrection,"
10230,WITHERED LEAVES.,"we shall all preserve our own identity, and see and know the beloved"
10231,WITHERED LEAVES.,companions of our earthly pilgrimage.
10232,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10233,WITHERED LEAVES.,Blessed be God for this sweet hope in the resurrection of the
10234,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dead, that so clothes the far off and unseen world with ecstatic"
10235,WITHERED LEAVES.,"anticipations of the renewed presence of our friends, to whom, even"
10236,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in their glorified appearance, we shall be no strangers. We must not"
10237,WITHERED LEAVES.,persuade ourselves that the preservation of little Emma's sacred dust
10238,WITHERED LEAVES.,is a mere tribute of affection to her memory; but rather a prophecy of
10239,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that precious hope, that she shall awake from this sleep and meet"
10240,WITHERED LEAVES.,"us again, and that we shall know her again, and that we shall be"
10241,WITHERED LEAVES.,"together, and unitedly hear that voice, sublime and almighty, yet"
10242,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tender and soothing, saying, ""I am the resurrection and the life; he"
10243,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that believeth in me though he were dead, yet shall he live."""
10244,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10245,WITHERED LEAVES.,The resurrection of the dead is the crowning act of the Redeemer's
10246,WITHERED LEAVES.,"power, and the consummation of his work. How beautiful to contemplate"
10247,WITHERED LEAVES.,the spiritual import and eternal grandeur of his mission:
10248,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10249,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""We may be blest, but Emma's glorious--"
10250,WITHERED LEAVES.,"O'er all the stings of death victorious."""
10251,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10252,WITHERED LEAVES.,Dear M.M.:
10253,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10254,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""You feel like Eve, when Eden's gate"
10255,WITHERED LEAVES.,Had closed on her forevermore;--
10256,WITHERED LEAVES.,"You feel that life is desolate,"
10257,WITHERED LEAVES.,And Paradise is o'er.
10258,WITHERED LEAVES.,"No tears be yours, for tears are vain;"
10259,WITHERED LEAVES.,Your heart and not your robe is rent:
10260,WITHERED LEAVES.,"If God who gave did take again,"
10261,WITHERED LEAVES.,'Tis folly to lament.
10262,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Then drop the curtain, fold by fold,"
10263,WITHERED LEAVES.,O'er her consecrated bower;
10264,WITHERED LEAVES.,"And veil from curious eyes, and cold,"
10265,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Your dead, yet living flower."""

10301,WITHERED LEAVES.,Visit to Mount Auburn.
10302,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10303,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10304,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was a beautiful day in autumn, when the mellow sun shed his"
10305,WITHERED LEAVES.,"subduing rays Over the face of decaying nature, that we entered the"
10306,WITHERED LEAVES.,"elegant carriage of an esteemed friend, and pursued our way towards"
10307,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Mount Auburn, that quiet resting place of the dead."
10308,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10309,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As we pursued our way from East Boston, the water in the harbor,"
10310,WITHERED LEAVES.,"whitened with many a sail, sparkled in the morning sun, and glittered"
10311,WITHERED LEAVES.,like ten thousand diamonds.
10312,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10313,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It was Saturday, busy, bustling Saturday, when all the world seemed"
10314,WITHERED LEAVES.,hurrying on as if to make amends for any deficiency in the other days
10315,WITHERED LEAVES.,of the week.
10316,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10317,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The white sea-gulls were floating through the air, often stooping as"
10318,WITHERED LEAVES.,"if to dip their wings in the ocean waves, that murmured gently upon"
10319,WITHERED LEAVES.,the winding shore.
10320,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10321,WITHERED LEAVES.,"There was scarce a cloud to be seen in the sky, and the calmness of"
10322,WITHERED LEAVES.,nature whispered peace to the weary spirit.
10323,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10324,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As we crossed the ferry and entered the city, and witnessed the moving"
10325,WITHERED LEAVES.,tide of human life that was surging through the city mart jostling
10326,WITHERED LEAVES.,against each other in their eager chase; and as we looked out upon the
10327,WITHERED LEAVES.,"motly group, human life was to be seen in almost all its forms."
10328,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10329,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Wealth hung out his golden trappings, and rolled by in all the"
10330,WITHERED LEAVES.,splendor of ease and luxury The children of poverty trudged on in
10331,WITHERED LEAVES.,"tattered garments, stung by pinching want, bearing heavy burdens upon"
10332,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their heads, and weighed down by oppression."
10333,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10334,WITHERED LEAVES.,"These scenes awoke many reflections in the mind, and presented the"
10335,WITHERED LEAVES.,contrast of life.
10336,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10337,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Passing through the city with its tumults and its changes, we pursued"
10338,WITHERED LEAVES.,our way through Cambridge to the Cemetery.
10339,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10340,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The scenery was beautiful, and as we passed the elm tree where"
10341,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Washington stood to give command to his army, how many associations"
10342,WITHERED LEAVES.,"rushed upon the mind, filling it with remembrances of our country's"
10343,WITHERED LEAVES.,early struggles.
10344,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10345,WITHERED LEAVES.,"We entered the quiet shades ""where rest the dead,"" sleeping beneath"
10346,WITHERED LEAVES.,the sober shadows of the forest trees that were scattering now and
10347,WITHERED LEAVES.,then a withered leaf upon the grassy mounds that lay at their feet.
10348,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Here still, even here too, is the same contrast so visible in the"
10349,WITHERED LEAVES.,"moving, active life of the city."
10350,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10351,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Wealth here has the splendid monument, embellished with all the"
10352,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sculptor's art, while the poor sleep as sweetly beneath the simple"
10353,WITHERED LEAVES.,sod.
10354,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10355,WITHERED LEAVES.,Our first visit was to the Chapel. You are struck upon your entrance
10356,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with the hollow sounds that reverberate at every footfall, reminding"
10357,WITHERED LEAVES.,one of the emptiness of all earthly things.
10358,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10359,WITHERED LEAVES.,"There was a coffin within the paling, covered with a black pall,"
10360,WITHERED LEAVES.,speaking to us of death and decay; but as we raised our eyes to the
10361,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stained glass windows, through which the autumnal sun was pouring his"
10362,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mellow rays, and casting such a subdued and peculiar light upon all"
10363,WITHERED LEAVES.,"things in the Chapel, and saw the heavenly expression of the angels as"
10364,WITHERED LEAVES.,"they took their upward flight, the soul seemed big with immortality,"
10365,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and the Christian's hope teeming with a better life, was cheering"
10366,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to it, lifting it up till the things of earth looked dim, distant,"
10367,WITHERED LEAVES.,shadowy.
10368,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10369,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The beautiful statue, too, touched so nicely by the hand of art, as to"
10370,WITHERED LEAVES.,"look like breathing marble, points the beholder upward to the skies."
10371,WITHERED LEAVES.,"This Chapel, standing as it does at the entrance of the Cemetery,"
10372,WITHERED LEAVES.,"is well calculated to solemnize, the mind, and prepare it for the"
10373,WITHERED LEAVES.,contemplations of the surrounding scene.
10374,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10375,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As we left its quiet retreat and pursued our onward way, sad thoughts"
10376,WITHERED LEAVES.,"came stealing over the mind, as we reflected how many aching hearts"
10377,WITHERED LEAVES.,and tearful eyes had passed over that road to deposit the dearly
10378,WITHERED LEAVES.,"loved, and lost in their last resting places."
10379,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10380,WITHERED LEAVES.,How proper it seems that a navigator should stand at the entrance to
10381,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pilot the way, and we can but think Spurzheim is taking his scientific"
10382,WITHERED LEAVES.,"observations, as his bust stands as though looking upon the passers by"
10383,WITHERED LEAVES.,as they pursue their way to the city of the dead.
10384,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10385,WITHERED LEAVES.,"We passed on our way through the winding avenues, presenting their"
10386,WITHERED LEAVES.,"striking and varied emblems, speaking so forcibly to the mind. The"
10387,WITHERED LEAVES.,white dove with open beak and half spread wing; the harp with
10388,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the broken string, and the broken column, are all beautiful and"
10389,WITHERED LEAVES.,"significant representations, preaching loudly for the silent dust that"
10390,WITHERED LEAVES.,slumbers beneath them.
10391,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10392,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As we ascended to the tower, we passed the yard enclosed with the"
10393,WITHERED LEAVES.,beautiful bronze fence. Looking from the tower you witnessed life with
10394,WITHERED LEAVES.,"its struggles, its comforts and luxuries; but the graves beneath us"
10395,WITHERED LEAVES.,"say, ""we must leave all, and come and make our beds with them."""
10396,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10397,WITHERED LEAVES.,"How striking is the anxious expression of the faithful dog, keeping"
10398,WITHERED LEAVES.,"patient watch over the grave of his young master, through summer's"
10399,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sultry heat, and winter's pinching cold, never betraying his trust."
10400,WITHERED LEAVES.,"How beautiful, and yet how simple is the touching inscriptions,"
10401,WITHERED LEAVES.,"""My Father,"" ""My Mother."" Neither name or age are mentioned to the"
10402,WITHERED LEAVES.,"stranger, yet what a volume is spoken directly to the heart. The white"
10403,WITHERED LEAVES.,lambs reposing upon the grassy mounds represent the innocence that
10404,WITHERED LEAVES.,slumbers beneath.
10405,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10406,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Many little tokens are scattered round here and there, as mementoes of"
10407,WITHERED LEAVES.,"fond affection. As we gazed upon the fresh boquets, wet with the dew"
10408,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of night, we felt that love lingered around those places, and the"
10409,WITHERED LEAVES.,tears of affection often fell there.
10410,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10411,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The flowers, beautiful though they are, either at the tomb or the"
10412,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bridal, give us no name or trace of former days, but lay scattered"
10413,WITHERED LEAVES.,"round in rich profusion, telling us of love and affection that cannot"
10414,WITHERED LEAVES.,"perish, because they are amaranthine flowers that have their root in"
10415,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the mind, and bear the impress of immortality; and as we gaze upon the"
10416,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beautiful, either in nature or art, it becomes daguerreotyped upon the"
10417,WITHERED LEAVES.,"soul, and thus lives forever, coming up at the touch of memory's wand,"
10418,WITHERED LEAVES.,with all the vividness of a first impression.
10419,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10420,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The forest trees standing in solemn grandeur, the winding avenues,"
10421,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the sloping hills, the deep dells, with the placid waters sleeping in"
10422,WITHERED LEAVES.,"their bosoms, with the bright red flowers contrasting with the white"
10423,WITHERED LEAVES.,"polished marble monuments, all conspire to render the place one"
10424,WITHERED LEAVES.,of extreme beauty and interest. But when we compare this with the
10425,WITHERED LEAVES.,"descriptions we have read of Westminster Abbey, covered with the"
10426,WITHERED LEAVES.,"mouldering dust of ages, as generation after generation has been added"
10427,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to it, we can picture to the imagination the change passing years"
10428,WITHERED LEAVES.,"will make here. The silent hand of time will steal by degrees,"
10429,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the freshness and beauty from the polished marble, effacing their"
10430,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beauties, one by one, 'till all are obliterated, and green mould"
10431,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and moss occupy their places, and the monument shall cease to be a"
10432,WITHERED LEAVES.,memorial.
10433,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10434,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Such is time with its changes, and yet the thoughtless race of man"
10435,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pass on, unheeding the destiny that awaits them, slow to learn the"
10436,WITHERED LEAVES.,lessons these solemn places are calculated to teach.
10437,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10438,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The birds as they sang in the branches, seemed breathing a dirge-like"
10439,WITHERED LEAVES.,"melody over the departed, and even their thrilling notes sounded"
10440,WITHERED LEAVES.,"solemn in this sacred place, so strong is the power of association"
10441,WITHERED LEAVES.,over the human mind.
10442,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10443,WITHERED LEAVES.,"After spending some hours in this shady place, and drinking in its"
10444,WITHERED LEAVES.,"beauties and its solemnities, 'till the mind became softened and"
10445,WITHERED LEAVES.,"subdued by surrounding influences, we left it, bearing in the memory"
10446,WITHERED LEAVES.,"all the rich variety of landscape, we had been gazing on."
10447,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10448,WITHERED LEAVES.,"We visited Fresh Pond, where so many go for amusement. Thus it is"
10449,WITHERED LEAVES.,"ever, the living sport upon the very graves of the departed. The"
10450,WITHERED LEAVES.,"scenery here, though beautiful and picturesque, has not the touching"
10451,WITHERED LEAVES.,"influences of the Cemetery, and so we lingered not there, but returned"
10452,WITHERED LEAVES.,"again to the busy city to contrast its bustle, and its stir, with the"
10453,WITHERED LEAVES.,deep quiet and silent shades of Mount Auburn.

10581,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10582,WITHERED LEAVES.,Dear Sisters in Christ:
10583,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10584,WITHERED LEAVES.,"We have journeyed on together, through another year, until we have"
10585,WITHERED LEAVES.,"reached that elevated period, where it has been our wont to pause and"
10586,WITHERED LEAVES.,"take a retrospective view of the past, and lay plans for the future."
10587,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10588,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Has the progress of our Association been satisfactory? I feel, my dear"
10589,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sisters, that while we have some things to deplore, we have much to be"
10590,WITHERED LEAVES.,"thankful for. No mother has been taken by death from our circle, and"
10591,WITHERED LEAVES.,we have been called to part with but one darling child; and while God
10592,WITHERED LEAVES.,"has taken from us one immortal spirit to bloom in his paradise above,"
10593,WITHERED LEAVES.,he has in his rich mercy bestowed upon us another to claim our
10594,WITHERED LEAVES.,sympathies and our prayers.
10595,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10596,WITHERED LEAVES.,Another year is gone--solemn thought! As we glance at the record of
10597,WITHERED LEAVES.,"its events, and contemplate its changes, we can but feel a realizing"
10598,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sense of the shortness of time, and the necessity of improving the"
10599,WITHERED LEAVES.,present to the best possible advantage. One after another has dropped
10600,WITHERED LEAVES.,"from our little circle, till we are left but few in number; but enough"
10601,WITHERED LEAVES.,"to claim the precious promise of the blessed Saviour, that he will be"
10602,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with us if we meet in his name. And, my sisters, has he not verified"
10603,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his promise unto us? for have we not felt our hearts burn within us,"
10604,WITHERED LEAVES.,"when we have knelt together before a mercy seat, and poured forth our"
10605,WITHERED LEAVES.,"prayers into the ear of that pitying Saviour, beseeching him to have"
10606,WITHERED LEAVES.,compassion upon us and our children. Have not the hours we have spent
10607,WITHERED LEAVES.,"together, conversing upon the things that pertain to the kingdom of"
10608,WITHERED LEAVES.,"God, and the moral and spiritual improvement of our children, been to"
10609,WITHERED LEAVES.,us like the oasis in the desert to the weary traveller? and may we not
10610,WITHERED LEAVES.,look back upon them as the spots where we rested beneath the shadow of
10611,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the Almighty, and drank from the healing waters of salvation. And my"
10612,WITHERED LEAVES.,"sisters, though we may not see the immediate results of our labors,"
10613,WITHERED LEAVES.,"let us rely upon the rich promises of God, that in due time the"
10614,WITHERED LEAVES.,"seed shall spring up and bear fruit, some ten, twenty, thirty,"
10615,WITHERED LEAVES.,sixty--perchance some an hundred fold. Then let us be encouraged to do
10616,WITHERED LEAVES.,with all our might what our hands find to do.
10617,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10618,WITHERED LEAVES.,"As we see the vacancies the past year has made, we can but feel, with"
10619,WITHERED LEAVES.,"Job, ""that when a few more years are come, I shall go the way whence"
10620,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I shall not return."" And truly we may adopt the language of Paul,"

10624,WITHERED LEAVES.,"My dear sisters, it now devolves upon me to resign the office"
10625,WITHERED LEAVES.,"necessity rather than choice compelled me to accept, and I feel that"
10626,WITHERED LEAVES.,"in so doing, I shall best promote the interests of the Association."
10627,WITHERED LEAVES.,"I thank you for your kind forbearance toward my short comings, which"

10629,WITHERED LEAVES.,hope the better offices of the succeeding year may tend to the greater
10630,WITHERED LEAVES.,promotion of the holy objects of your Association. And while we meet
10631,WITHERED LEAVES.,"together, and pray together, and together wait for the harvest, may we"

10642,WITHERED LEAVES.,Improvement of Time
10643,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10644,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10645,WITHERED LEAVES.,There is nothing more necessary for our future welfare than the
10646,WITHERED LEAVES.,improvement of time. Our time is too valuable to be spent in idleness.
10647,WITHERED LEAVES.,"If we wish to be respected, we must be industrious; and to be"
10648,WITHERED LEAVES.,industrious we must know how to value our time. Every moment must
10649,WITHERED LEAVES.,be spent as we should wish it had been when we come to years of
10650,WITHERED LEAVES.,discretion. There are many things that we can busy ourselves in doing
10651,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that will fill up a few leisure moments, and perhaps it will do some"
10652,WITHERED LEAVES.,"good. If we are poor, we can relieve our parents in trying to assist"
10653,WITHERED LEAVES.,"them in the daily labors and toils of life, for hard must be the lot"
10654,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of that toil-worn father, and care-worn mother, who have a numerous"
10655,WITHERED LEAVES.,"family to maintain by their daily labor, all careless and indifferent"
10656,WITHERED LEAVES.,"of their hardships and fatigues. If we are rich, we can make those"
10657,WITHERED LEAVES.,happy around us by the thousand nameless attentions which the hand of
10658,WITHERED LEAVES.,"industry alone can supply. Therefore, whatever our situation in life"
10659,WITHERED LEAVES.,"may be, the good improvement of our time will not only tend to promote"
10660,WITHERED LEAVES.,"our usefulness, but our happiness. Take for instance a man who has"
10661,WITHERED LEAVES.,"indulged in habits of indolence from his childhood, and see what it"
10662,WITHERED LEAVES.,has brought him to. He has been in the habit of lounging about
10663,WITHERED LEAVES.,"the streets unemployed, or perhaps watching for opportunities for"
10664,WITHERED LEAVES.,mischief; step by step he descends in his moral degradation; vice
10665,WITHERED LEAVES.,"succeeds folly, till a dark catalogue of crimes brings him to a"
10666,WITHERED LEAVES.,"drunkard's grave. State prison, or the gallows. While, on the other"
10667,WITHERED LEAVES.,"hand, take a man who has been accustomed to labor and toil for"
10668,WITHERED LEAVES.,"his daily food, and see how much more he is respected, and what a"
10669,WITHERED LEAVES.,difference there is in the lives of those two men. The one is beloved
10670,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and respected, and the other is miserable and degraded."
10671,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10672,WITHERED LEAVES.,"The industrious man begins life, and perhaps has no better prospects"
10673,WITHERED LEAVES.,before him than his companion; but see how much better he ends life
10674,WITHERED LEAVES.,"than the other. He begins to climb the ladder of science, and by"
10675,WITHERED LEAVES.,"perseverance, he will soon reach the top round, and he can not do this"
10676,WITHERED LEAVES.,unless he improves his time.
10677,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10678,WITHERED LEAVES.,We have ample proof that unless we improve our time we can not be
10679,WITHERED LEAVES.,"happy or respected, and when we have a feeling of indolence come over"
10680,WITHERED LEAVES.,"us, we must shake it off and try to arouse our energies, and we must"
10681,WITHERED LEAVES.,bear in mind that for every idle moment we must give an account at the
10682,WITHERED LEAVES.,"bar of God on the judgment day, before God and man."

10742,WITHERED LEAVES.,"pleasure to most all persons, unless their lives have been fraught"
10743,WITHERED LEAVES.,"with crimes of so daring a nature, that it makes the the heart revolt"

10745,WITHERED LEAVES.,"scenes of by-gone days, and recall one beloved companion and another,"
10746,WITHERED LEAVES.,"that have passed away, and to think of the many happy interviews we"

10748,WITHERED LEAVES.,
10749,WITHERED LEAVES.,"It is necessary for the scholar to improve his memory, that he may"

10751,WITHERED LEAVES.,time; that he may receive the reward he has anxiously sought for. It
10752,WITHERED LEAVES.,is pleasant to the aged to recall the scenes that have long since
10753,WITHERED LEAVES.,"slumbered in oblivion, and awaken from the hallowed precincts of the"
10754,WITHERED LEAVES.,"dead, thoughts of friends with whom they were wont to associate in"

10872,WITHERED LEAVES.,"waters, once the Indian roamed, in untamed freedom, through forests"
10873,WITHERED LEAVES.,"unbroken by the woodman's axe. Here resounded the fierce war-whoop,"
10874,WITHERED LEAVES.,"and here the wild death song; here was built the council-fire, and"
10875,WITHERED LEAVES.,"here was smoked the pipe of peace; in fine, here on this very spot"
