22,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
23,PREFACE.,
24,PREFACE.,
25,PREFACE.,The Author of this volume does not feel much apology necessary for its
26,PREFACE.,"publication, though the world is already flooded with Rhyme, upon"
27,PREFACE.,"almost every conceivable subject, and most of it of a very mediocre"
28,PREFACE.,character.
29,PREFACE.,
30,PREFACE.,"Though living but a short time upon a Bush farm, my experiences were of"
31,PREFACE.,such a practical nature as to entitle me to speak with confidence on
32,PREFACE.,many rural matters. The religious opinions so frequently and strongly
33,PREFACE.,"expressed are the result of a careful study of God's Word, and I feel"
34,PREFACE.,that for them no apology is necessary.
35,PREFACE.,
36,PREFACE.,To learning I make but the most slender pretentions. Born in one of the
37,PREFACE.,"humblest ranks in life, and going to my trade at the commencement of my"
38,PREFACE.,"_teens_, and working long weary hours for seven years at that"
39,PREFACE.,"trade, I found little opportunity of attaining anything like"
40,PREFACE.,proficiency in literary composition. Many of my minor pieces have
41,PREFACE.,"already seen the light in local and other newspapers, etc., and acting"
42,PREFACE.,on the advice of several literary friends I have at last gathered my
43,PREFACE.,principal poems together in a permanent form. Should this effort not
44,PREFACE.,"meet with public favor, the offense--if such it be--is not likely to be"
45,PREFACE.,"repeated, as I am now over sixty-five years of age. Many of the"
46,PREFACE.,"productions of my humble Muse were conceived, and in a great measure"
47,PREFACE.,"composed, while working at the bench--to which I am still confined, in"
48,PREFACE.,order to provide for my family's needs.
49,PREFACE.,
50,PREFACE.,"If the advice of Pope to some of the Rhymers of his day was needful,"
51,PREFACE.,"viz., ""to keep their effusions for _seven years_,"" I can say truly"
52,PREFACE.,most of mine have been kept that period nearly four times over. I would
53,PREFACE.,not have the reader imagine that they have necessarily grown better by
54,PREFACE.,being on the shelf; still this has afforded an opportunity for
55,PREFACE.,polishing them up in some measure.
56,PREFACE.,
57,PREFACE.,"I may further say my ""Emigrant Mechanic"" was nearly or quite finished"
58,PREFACE.,"before Mr. McLachlan's ""Emigrant"" was published, and before I had ever"
59,PREFACE.,"heard of ""The U. E.,"" a beautiful and very interesting Emigrant poem by"
60,PREFACE.,"Mr. Kerby, of Niagara."
61,PREFACE.,
62,PREFACE.,"My warmest thanks are due the Rev. W. W. Smith, of Newmarket, Ont., for"
63,PREFACE.,his kindness in undertaking the preparation of these pages for the
64,PREFACE.,press. Also for many valuable emendations.
65,PREFACE.,
66,PREFACE.,"Such as they are I send forth my unlearned rhymes, with the earnest"
67,PREFACE.,prayer that they may benefit the reader as much as they have benefitted
68,PREFACE.,"me, for I can say in the words of Coleridge, ""Poetry has been to me its"
69,PREFACE.,"own exceeding great reward."""

401,BOOK I.,"But soon Affliction, with her visage dire,"

408,BOOK I.,And she was laid by her dear mother's side.
409,BOOK I.,"Such fearful strokes, to one in poverty,"
410,BOOK I.,"Were hard to bear, as all may clearly see."
411,BOOK I.,"But this poor man, all strong in holy faith,"
412,BOOK I.,Was led to take a proper view of death--
413,BOOK I.,E'en to regard him as an enemy
414,BOOK I.,Conquered by Him who died on Calvary--
415,BOOK I.,And view his loved ones but as gone before.
416,BOOK I.,To Canaan's blest and truly happy shore!
417,BOOK I.,
418,BOOK I.,Ere long the Lord a partner did prepare
419,BOOK I.,"To aid this Christian, and his sorrow share."
420,BOOK I.,She had for many years in service been;
421,BOOK I.,"Of careful habits, in good pay I ween."
422,BOOK I.,And this enabled her to lay aside
423,BOOK I.,"A goodly sum, and keep her needs supplied."
424,BOOK I.,"This virtuous woman thus became ""a crown"""
425,BOOK I.,"To that poor man, by trials well bowed down."
426,BOOK I.,"And by her cleverness in housewif'ry,"
427,BOOK I.,"With constant practice of economy,"
428,BOOK I.,The family soon enjoyed a greater share
429,BOOK I.,"Of household comforts, and had much less care."
430,BOOK I.,
431,BOOK I.,"Thus early schooled, our WILLIAM grew apace,"
432,BOOK I.,"And though still young, wore oft a thoughtful face."
433,BOOK I.,"By nature studious, and of ready turn,"
434,BOOK I.,He needful tasks most eagerly did learn.
435,BOOK I.,"And being inquisitive, 'twas his desire"
436,BOOK I.,"On winter nights, and by their frugal fire,"
437,BOOK I.,That his dear father should to him make known
438,BOOK I.,What kind of ancestry they chanced to own.
439,BOOK I.,"To this the father, with a smiling face,"
440,BOOK I.,"Soon made reply, ""We spring from noble race!"
441,BOOK I.,"Long, long ago, I can in truth declare,"
442,BOOK I.,"A wandering Minstrel visited a fair,"
443,BOOK I.,"And there saw one of very noble blood,"
444,BOOK I.,Who liked him well and deemed his music good.
445,BOOK I.,"They soon contrived each others' minds to learn,"
446,BOOK I.,And felt Love's flame within their bosoms burn;
447,BOOK I.,"But knowing well this would not be allowed,"
448,BOOK I.,"Disguised, away they fled amongst a crowd."
449,BOOK I.,Soon they were fast in honest wedlock tied;
450,BOOK I.,And thus the Minstrel gained a lovely bride!
451,BOOK I.,Yet were they destined not to live in peace--
452,BOOK I.,For ELLEN'S brother vowed he would not cease
453,BOOK I.,"To search for them through all the country wide,"
454,BOOK I.,And quick return with ELLEN at his side!
455,BOOK I.,"Long time he searched, then gave them up for lost,"
456,BOOK I.,"And proved his boasting vain, unto his cost."
457,BOOK I.,"But on one night he, weary, sad and faint,"
458,BOOK I.,"Espied a house, and to that house he went--"
459,BOOK I.,"Just reached the threshold, and sank down quite spent."
460,BOOK I.,"The fair young mistress, with a piteous eye,"
461,BOOK I.,"Beheld the man, and feared that he would die."
462,BOOK I.,"She loosed his vest, then laid his bosom bare,"
463,BOOK I.,And spied a mark which well might make her stare.
464,BOOK I.,It was her brother! and her gentle heart
465,BOOK I.,With love o'erflowed to act a sister's part.
466,BOOK I.,"Most earnest efforts quick the man restored,"
467,BOOK I.,And ELLEN felt most grateful to the Lord.
468,BOOK I.,"She, fully conscious of strict rectitude,"
469,BOOK I.,"Confessed her kindred, and for pardon sued."
470,BOOK I.,The astonished brother clasped her in his arms;
471,BOOK I.,"Their early love afresh their spirit warms,"
472,BOOK I.,And all his hatred very soon disarms.
473,BOOK I.,"This Minstrel, with his lovely ELLEN, were"
474,BOOK I.,"Our ancestors, as you may well infer."""
475,BOOK I.,
476,BOOK I.,"[Footnote: In proof that the above legend has some foundation in fact,"
477,BOOK I.,I may state that one of my hero's cousins in England has a gold headed
478,BOOK I.,"cane, and another a splendid jasper snuff-box, both said to have been"
479,BOOK I.,left by the party who came to seek the runaway lady.]
480,BOOK I.,
481,BOOK I.,"Young COOPER heard, and could not well conceal"
482,BOOK I.,Some stirring thoughts that he began to feel.
483,BOOK I.,He still was of a very tender age;
484,BOOK I.,"Far, far too young to feel Ambition's rage."
485,BOOK I.,"But he had heard of Dukes, and Earls, and Lords,"
486,BOOK I.,And all the splendor which their rank affords;
487,BOOK I.,Had seen in prints their castles and their halls;
488,BOOK I.,Had heard of servants who obeyed their calls;
489,BOOK I.,"Of their vast parks, well filled with noble deer,"
490,BOOK I.,Their tables loaded with the best of cheer;
491,BOOK I.,"Of horses, carriages, and fleetest hounds,"
492,BOOK I.,And cattle feeding over all their grounds;
493,BOOK I.,"Of gardens filled with precious fruits and flowers,"
494,BOOK I.,And of sweet music to beguile their hours;
495,BOOK I.,"Fancied their mansions full of lovely girls,"
496,BOOK I.,"With beauteous eyes, and richly flowing curls;"
497,BOOK I.,"In short, conceived that these men were no less"
498,BOOK I.,Than mighty lords whom every eye should bless.
499,BOOK I.,And 'twas no wonder if in reverie
500,BOOK I.,This boy indulged with greatest frequency.
501,BOOK I.,
502,BOOK I.,"But years flew by, with all their constant care,"
503,BOOK I.,"New hopes, new scenes, and feelings of despair."
504,BOOK I.,"He owning still a constitution weak,"
505,BOOK I.,Would better health in change of air oft seek.
506,BOOK I.,"At times like these, his second mother's care"
507,BOOK I.,Did send him forth with relatives to fare.
508,BOOK I.,"And then sweet Crossthwaite, with its paper mill,"
509,BOOK I.,"Its pretty brooks, and many a trickling rill,"
510,BOOK I.,With dearest pleasure would his bosom fill.
511,BOOK I.,Deep gratitude impels him now to pay
512,BOOK I.,"A tribute due to relatives, and say"
513,BOOK I.,That purer kindness could not be displayed
514,BOOK I.,"To any one who needed friendly aid,"
515,BOOK I.,"Than they still showed to him while living there,"
516,BOOK I.,"As their own child, he did their goodness share."
517,BOOK I.,"Dear, aged friends! grim Death has laid you low,"
518,BOOK I.,And you no more to him can kindness show!
519,BOOK I.,
520,BOOK I.,"Often thy scenery, fair Underbarrow,"
521,BOOK I.,Has cheered his spirit and dispelled his sorrow!
522,BOOK I.,"Thy hazel copses, and thy rugged _Scaur_,"
523,BOOK I.,With yellow-blooming whins have banished far
524,BOOK I.,"All thoughts of his poor, weak and sickly frame,"
525,BOOK I.,And raised his love of Nature to a flame!
526,BOOK I.,"Yes, often now, though living o'er the sea,"
527,BOOK I.,"And many years have fled since he saw thee,"
528,BOOK I.,"Dear Memory brings thy early charms to view,"
529,BOOK I.,And all their pleasures to his mind seem new!
530,BOOK I.,"Again, fresh scenes would his attention crave,"
531,BOOK I.,Ev'n noble Windermere with rippling wave;
532,BOOK I.,"And frequently he crossed o'er its short ferry,"
533,BOOK I.,"In huge flat-boats, or pleasant sailing wherry,"
534,BOOK I.,"And viewed, well pleased, its many lovely isles,"
535,BOOK I.,Clothed with rich verdure and sweet Summer's smiles;
536,BOOK I.,"Or watched the fishes, darting to and fro,"
537,BOOK I.,As o'er its crystal waves the boat would go;
538,BOOK I.,"And still remembers those rich wooded hills,"
539,BOOK I.,While deep emotion all his spirit thrills.
540,BOOK I.,"Sometimes tired Nature would assert her sway,"
541,BOOK I.,Then gloomy thoughts rose up in dark array;
542,BOOK I.,"He thus would wander, weary and alone,"
543,BOOK I.,"Listening the breezes in their fitful moan,"
544,BOOK I.,"As in their anger they swept through the woods,"
545,BOOK I.,"While thunder-clouds sent down their copious floods,"
546,BOOK I.,"And ask himself, in bitterness of soul,"
547,BOOK I.,Why he his destiny could not control?
548,BOOK I.,"Why some were wealthy, and could take their ease,"
549,BOOK I.,And ride about wherever they should please?
550,BOOK I.,"While he, poor lad, on foot his weary way"
551,BOOK I.,"Kept plodding still, till nearly close of day!"
552,BOOK I.,
553,BOOK I.,"At other times a pleasant lodge was seen,"
554,BOOK I.,Where life seemed spent in happiness serene;
555,BOOK I.,"Its graceful lawn, its gardens and its fields,"
556,BOOK I.,Spoke loudly of the comfort _money_ yields;
557,BOOK I.,And oft he vainly dreamed that he possessed
558,BOOK I.,"Just such a home, and with such comforts blest."
559,BOOK I.,"Sweet day-dreams these, quite frequently indulged;"
560,BOOK I.,"Too oft, alas! were all his thoughts divulged."
561,BOOK I.,
562,BOOK I.,"Before him soon more charming views arise,"
563,BOOK I.,Enchanting scenes meet everywhere his eyes.
564,BOOK I.,"See Low Wood Inn, a sweet, secluded spot,"
565,BOOK I.,"Most lovely sight, not soon to be forgot!"
566,BOOK I.,It stands upon the margin of the lake--
567,BOOK I.,And of it all things round conspire to make
568,BOOK I.,A mansion such as poets well might choose--
569,BOOK I.,Fit habitation for the heaven-born Muse!
570,BOOK I.,"Well might he linger with entranced delight,"
571,BOOK I.,Though Sol gave warning of approaching night.
572,BOOK I.,"Aroused by this, ere long he forward hied"
573,BOOK I.,To that small village still called Ambleside.
574,BOOK I.,"We now again will cross with him the lake,"
575,BOOK I.,And thence the road that leads to Hawkshead take;
576,BOOK I.,There Esthwaite water on a smaller scale
577,BOOK I.,"Unfolds her beauties, to adorn my tale."
578,BOOK I.,"She, like a mirror, on her silvery face"
579,BOOK I.,Reflects the mansions that her margins grace.
580,BOOK I.,"Those mansions fair are seen on every hand,"
581,BOOK I.,"(What may not wealth, in such a place, command?)"
582,BOOK I.,And mark their owners men of wealth and taste;
583,BOOK I.,"Not miserly, nor yet inclined to waste."
584,BOOK I.,
585,BOOK I.,"Near this small lake does a rude hamlet stand,"
586,BOOK I.,"In which there dwelt a poor, hard-working band."
587,BOOK I.,"The parents, both, were well advanced in age,"
588,BOOK I.,"And yet, from kindness, they at once engage"
589,BOOK I.,"To give this youth a welcome to their board,"
590,BOOK I.,And all the comforts that their means afford.
591,BOOK I.,"To see him happy was their chief desire,"
592,BOOK I.,Which did his soul with gratitude inspire.
593,BOOK I.,"They now are dead! Oh, may their ashes rest"
594,BOOK I.,"In peace, and still their memories be bless'd!"
595,BOOK I.,WILLIAM oft thinks of all the pleasant scenes
596,BOOK I.,He there enjoyed before he reached his _teens_;
597,BOOK I.,And well remembers how he loved to stray
598,BOOK I.,"By that pure lake, soon after break of day."
599,BOOK I.,"'Twas at such time, that once he chanced to spy"
600,BOOK I.,A splendid _pike_ upon the beach quite dry
601,BOOK I.,"He viewed the prize; it had not long been dead,"
602,BOOK I.,As he well knew by looking at its head.
603,BOOK I.,"Surprised, he gazed about, on every hand,"
604,BOOK I.,But saw no soul upon the lake or land;
605,BOOK I.,"Then thought, since no one came the fish to claim,"
606,BOOK I.,"Take it he might, and yet incur no blame."
607,BOOK I.,"This settled in his mind, without delay"
608,BOOK I.,"He seized the fish, and carried it away."
609,BOOK I.,"When he reached home, friends thought it would be best"
610,BOOK I.,'Gainst noon-tide hour to have it nicely dressed.
611,BOOK I.,"But candor now obliges me to say,"
612,BOOK I.,That the right owner soon appeared next day;
613,BOOK I.,"Who said he lately caught a noble pike,"
614,BOOK I.,And laid it carefully beside a dyke;
615,BOOK I.,"But, while he went still farther up the lake,"
616,BOOK I.,"To draw some lines, and other fishes take,"
617,BOOK I.,"A dog, or person, had purloined that one:"
618,BOOK I.,A cousin told him WILL the deed had done!
619,BOOK I.,"Told how he brought to them, with boyish glee,"
620,BOOK I.,As fine a pike as ever one could see!
621,BOOK I.,"This heard, the loser took it in good part,"
622,BOOK I.,"Enjoyed the joke, and showed a kindly heart."
623,BOOK I.,
624,BOOK I.,"Hail, human kindness! Often have I been"
625,BOOK I.,Indebted to thee for same pleasing scene;
626,BOOK I.,"Although our race have sadly fallen low,"
627,BOOK I.,"Thou still appearest like the heavenly bow,"
628,BOOK I.,Amidst the storms of human passion now;
629,BOOK I.,"And where, dear Angel, thou art to be found,"
630,BOOK I.,Sweet peace and comfort flow to all around!
631,BOOK I.,
632,BOOK I.,An incident I now would introduce
633,BOOK I.,"Which may, perchance, be now and then of use"
634,BOOK I.,"In leading youths to greater carefulness,"
635,BOOK I.,When to sweet pleasure they themselves address.
636,BOOK I.,"Near Esthwaite's foot exists a lonely spot,"
637,BOOK I.,"Named by the country people ""The Priest's Pot"";"
638,BOOK I.,"A strange, deep hole, with crystal water filled,"
639,BOOK I.,By land surrounded which was never tilled;
640,BOOK I.,"Of spongy texture, yielding to the foot--"
641,BOOK I.,Quite full of danger is this marshy spot.
642,BOOK I.,"To this place WILLIAM once a fishing went,"
643,BOOK I.,"And, ere his patience was completely spent,"
644,BOOK I.,"Took up a fresh position; but, alas!"
645,BOOK I.,His foothold proved but little else than grass.
646,BOOK I.,"While sinking fast he, with a fluttering heart,"
647,BOOK I.,Gave one quick spring and reached a firmer part.
648,BOOK I.,This proved a lesson which he ne'er forgot--
649,BOOK I.,He visited no more that dreaded spot.
650,BOOK I.,
651,BOOK I.,"Before this time, for years, he went to school,"
652,BOOK I.,And caught some learning by the common rule;
653,BOOK I.,"In _parsing_ showed a fair amount of skill,"
654,BOOK I.,"Wrote a plain hand, and _read_ with right good will;"
655,BOOK I.,"Almost a ""book-worm,"" seemed he to devour"
656,BOOK I.,"What books he got, and read from hour to hour."
657,BOOK I.,"And, oh! how pleased and gratified was he,"
658,BOOK I.,To hear the Master read sweet poetry!
659,BOOK I.,"Once he read well a very touching tale,"
660,BOOK I.,In which the Poet does the lot bewail
661,BOOK I.,"Of orphan ""Lubin,"" who, while tending sheep"
662,BOOK I.,"For a hard master, oft was seen to weep."
663,BOOK I.,"While this pathetic tale was read aloud,"
664,BOOK I.,The tears to WILLIAM'S eyes would quickly crowd;
665,BOOK I.,And from that time a Poet he became--
666,BOOK I.,In joy or sorrow felt a glowing flame.
667,BOOK I.,"Though still so young he, at this very time,"
668,BOOK I.,"Oft framed rude numbers, and poured forth his rhyme;"
669,BOOK I.,"And 'twas no wonder if, by Nature taught,"
670,BOOK I.,He wrapped himself in sweet poetic thought.
671,BOOK I.,"He, to this day, is pleased to recollect"
672,BOOK I.,"What few, who knew him then, would e'er suspect--"
673,BOOK I.,"How much he loved to wander in the woods,"
674,BOOK I.,And watch the trees put forth their opening buds;
675,BOOK I.,"Or list the sound created by the wind,"
676,BOOK I.,Which sought a passage through the leaves to find.
677,BOOK I.,"He also loved, with wonder and delight,"
678,BOOK I.,To gaze on flowers bedecked with glory bright;
679,BOOK I.,"On polyanthus and auriculas,"
680,BOOK I.,In pleasing contrast with the ribbon-grass;
681,BOOK I.,"On wall-flower, too, with richest odor filled,"
682,BOOK I.,Like sweet frankincense daintily distilled;
683,BOOK I.,"On roses fair, in great variety"
684,BOOK I.,"Of scent and color; and the peony,"
685,BOOK I.,"Or scented violet, which scarce shows its head,"
686,BOOK I.,Yet does its odor o'er the garden shed;
687,BOOK I.,"On prince's feather, wearing stately plume,"
688,BOOK I.,"With much of show, but nothing of perfume;"
689,BOOK I.,"Loved tulips, lilies, pinks and gilliflowers,"
690,BOOK I.,"With woodbines trained o'er lovely garden bowers,"
691,BOOK I.,"That give forth sweetness and their charms display,"
692,BOOK I.,"While, in rich robes, they stand in full array;"
693,BOOK I.,"The foxglove, daisy, and demure monk's-hood,"
694,BOOK I.,"With lilacs, and the scented southern wood;"
695,BOOK I.,"The guelder-rose, with its fair, whited balls,"
696,BOOK I.,"And creeping plants, high climbing up the walls,"
697,BOOK I.,"These at all times our hero warmly loved,"
698,BOOK I.,"And showed it, too, when he in gardens roved."
699,BOOK I.,"While, to himself, he had a patch of ground,"
700,BOOK I.,"Where, at his leisure, he was mostly found."
701,BOOK I.,"Thus passed, most pleasantly, his youthful days,"
702,BOOK I.,"All intermingled with his boyish plays,"
703,BOOK I.,And sometimes meriting a need of praise.

719,BOOK II.,
720,BOOK II.,Domestic bliss! what tongue can speak thy praise!
721,BOOK II.,"What poet give, even in his noblest lays,"
722,BOOK II.,"An eulogy that shall thy charms express,"
723,BOOK II.,"Clothed in Truth's language, thy own native dress?"
724,BOOK II.,To thy sweet influence do we owe the choice
725,BOOK II.,"Of all mankind, whoever raised their voice"
726,BOOK II.,"In Freedom's cause, or stood on battle-ground,"
727,BOOK II.,While Liberty her banner waved around.
728,BOOK II.,"To thee, when governed by God's holy book,"
729,BOOK II.,Must we in future for true heroes look.
730,BOOK II.,"For if thou dwellest in each family,"
731,BOOK II.,Then long may wave the flag of Liberty!
732,BOOK II.,"To keep thee shining brightly round each hearth,"
733,BOOK II.,Is worth the wealth contained in all the earth!
734,BOOK II.,It does become us then to study well
735,BOOK II.,(Who knows the secret? Would some Angel tell?)
736,BOOK II.,The best of means by which to foster this
737,BOOK II.,"Great earthly blessing, pure domestic bliss!"
738,BOOK II.,Hail sweet conjugal union! Hail to thee!
739,BOOK II.,May I thy humble votary ever be!
740,BOOK II.,"Take thee away, and each dear earthly home"
741,BOOK II.,Would soon a scene of dreadful strife become;
742,BOOK II.,And from this source would spring a thousand woes
743,BOOK II.,Which to imagine has my heart's blood froze!
744,BOOK II.,
745,BOOK II.,"Dear fellow countrymen! Stand forward now,"
746,BOOK II.,And faithful prove unto your marriage vow.
747,BOOK II.,I conjure you by all the sacred ties
748,BOOK II.,"By which you're bound unto your families,"
749,BOOK II.,"Whatever faults, through weakness, you display,"
750,BOOK II.,In this be faithful to your dying day!
751,BOOK II.,"Why will you leave the wife you swore to love,"
752,BOOK II.,"Who should to you be as a precious dove,"
753,BOOK II.,"To wanton with a harlot void of shame,"
754,BOOK II.,And bring disgrace upon a father's name?
755,BOOK II.,"Why will you pierce yourselves with sorrow through,"
756,BOOK II.,"And ruin bring upon your children, too?"
757,BOOK II.,"Oh! let a broken-hearted wife's deep sighs,"
758,BOOK II.,"And children's woes, bring tears into your eyes!"
759,BOOK II.,"Give to yourselves no rest, by day or night,"
760,BOOK II.,Till you have made their saddened faces bright.
761,BOOK II.,"Oh! there is One above who sees you now,"
762,BOOK II.,If you repent not he will bring you low!
763,BOOK II.,"Regard this warning, flee to God for peace,"
764,BOOK II.,From loving your dear families never cease.
765,BOOK II.,
766,BOOK II.,"And ye, whose task it is to make our laws,"
767,BOOK II.,Lend your strong influence to aid this cause;
768,BOOK II.,See that your hands are clean--or make them so--
769,BOOK II.,"You've much to answer for, of weal or woe."
770,BOOK II.,Young COOPER'S parents did on him impress
771,BOOK II.,The way to gain domestic happiness:
772,BOOK II.,More by example than by precepts strong
773,BOOK II.,They their dear children sought to lead along
774,BOOK II.,Their constant conduct to each other told
775,BOOK II.,What they preferred before the richest gold.
776,BOOK II.,And one who knows them well can testify
777,BOOK II.,"That they themselves would evermore deny,"
778,BOOK II.,"Ere they would risk their own or family's peace,"
779,BOOK II.,"As some have done, who scarce from jarring cease."
780,BOOK II.,"In such a family, as we might expect,"
781,BOOK II.,True discipline met not with long neglect.
782,BOOK II.,"And this, employed aright, the Lord will bless,"
783,BOOK II.,In spite of childhood's frequent waywardness.
784,BOOK II.,
785,BOOK II.,"Trained in this manner, WILLIAM soon arrived"
786,BOOK II.,Just to the time when means should he contrived
787,BOOK II.,"To get for him at once a proper trade,"
788,BOOK II.,And he to this not one objection made.
789,BOOK II.,It was his choice that he might he employed
790,BOOK II.,"In marble works, and had the thought enjoyed"
791,BOOK II.,That some good master would his service need;
792,BOOK II.,But disappointment was for him decreed.
793,BOOK II.,"Some other places then the father tried,"
794,BOOK II.,But all with _boys_ appeared to be supplied.
795,BOOK II.,"The youth more anxious grew from day to day,"
796,BOOK II.,Nor could well brook what seemed such sad delay.
797,BOOK II.,"He oft retired at night unto his bed,"
798,BOOK II.,With various plans contrived in his young head;
799,BOOK II.,"But vanished soon were all these well-formed schemes,"
800,BOOK II.,As though they were so many empty dreams;
801,BOOK II.,"Until, by ""hope deferred,"" he was made sad,"
802,BOOK II.,And even home scenes failed to make him glad.
803,BOOK II.,"He now had nearly reached his thirteenth year,"
804,BOOK II.,"And did a small, weak youth, indeed, appear;"
805,BOOK II.,"Yet though so very young and small, this boy"
806,BOOK II.,"Had felt deep sorrow, and no little joy."
807,BOOK II.,
808,BOOK II.,"Good news at last he heard, with much delight,"
809,BOOK II.,When his dear father came from work one night;
810,BOOK II.,"He said a tradesman an apprentice wanted,"
811,BOOK II.,And told what wages would to him be granted.
812,BOOK II.,"WILLIAM at once accepted of the place,"
813,BOOK II.,And met the man next morn with smiling face.
814,BOOK II.,'Twas soon agreed that he a month should try
815,BOOK II.,"The work, and his new master satisfy."
816,BOOK II.,"This soon flew past, and he was strongly bound"
817,BOOK II.,"Till seven long years should, in their course, move round."
818,BOOK II.,
819,BOOK II.,To mention all his trials and mishaps
820,BOOK II.,"Would please no reader of this tale, perhaps;"
821,BOOK II.,"Suffice to say, he did himself exert"
822,BOOK II.,"In his new business, and was soon expert"
823,BOOK II.,In making up their wares of shining metal--
824,BOOK II.,"A teapot, can, or otherwise a kettle."
825,BOOK II.,"Let none despise him for his occupation,"
826,BOOK II.,For God has stamped it with His approbation.
827,BOOK II.,"'Tis therefore lawful, and should always be"
828,BOOK II.,"Approved of men, though e'en of high degree."
829,BOOK II.,God's holy book commands that saints engage
830,BOOK II.,"In honest callings, throughout every age;"
831,BOOK II.,"That they may lead a just and holy life,"
832,BOOK II.,Nor needlessly be found in worldly strife;
833,BOOK II.,"That they themselves and households may maintain,"
834,BOOK II.,From the just proceeds of a righteous gain.
835,BOOK II.,"Let none be found so foolish or so base,"
836,BOOK II.,As to regard mechanics as a race
837,BOOK II.,"Devoid of intellect and common sense,"
838,BOOK II.,Who to true honor have no just pretence.
839,BOOK II.,Our ranks can boast of one far higher name
840,BOOK II.,Than e'er was found in other paths of fame.
841,BOOK II.,"This, my assertion, may to many prove"
842,BOOK II.,"A puzzle great, while puzzles they do love."
843,BOOK II.,"Cheer up, ye poor mechanics! and pursue"
844,BOOK II.,"Your lowly trades, and Heaven keep still in view."
845,BOOK II.,
846,BOOK II.,"Ye who have naught to boast save rank and wealth,"
847,BOOK II.,Look round you openly--or look by stealth;
848,BOOK II.,See what our factories have done for you--
849,BOOK II.,And for the world--whichever side you view!
850,BOOK II.,"Without them, Ocean ne'er would bear a sail"
851,BOOK II.,"To catch the breeze, or fly before the gale;"
852,BOOK II.,"Without them, where could we obtain the Press--"
853,BOOK II.,That mightiest engine in the universe?
854,BOOK II.,"Take it away, and we should back be thrown"
855,BOOK II.,"Into dark ages, which would Science drown."
856,BOOK II.,While all the household comforts that we boast
857,BOOK II.,"Would disappear, and be forever lost!"
858,BOOK II.,Such thoughts as these would ramble through the brain
859,BOOK II.,"Of our apprentice, while he did maintain"
860,BOOK II.,"A due respect for those above him placed,"
861,BOOK II.,And kept these things within his mind encased.
862,BOOK II.,
863,BOOK II.,Let none suppose that he his trade pursued
864,BOOK II.,Without exposure to temptations rude.
865,BOOK II.,"In that small shop he found a vicious youth,"
866,BOOK II.,"Who feared not God, nor yet regarded truth:"
867,BOOK II.,"One who deep drank, who gambled, swore and lied"
868,BOOK II.,"Most awfully; nor can it be denied,"
869,BOOK II.,Some other practices he did pursue
870,BOOK II.,"Which, I would hope, he long has learned to rue."
871,BOOK II.,'Twas well for WILLIAM that this vicious youth
872,BOOK II.,"Was, undisguisedly, averse to truth;"
873,BOOK II.,"That, in attempting to sow evil seeds,"
874,BOOK II.,He made no secret of his foulest deeds.
875,BOOK II.,"Howe'er it was, our hero stood his ground,"
876,BOOK II.,In such sad vices never was he found.
877,BOOK II.,He now acknowledges 'twas God's rich grace
878,BOOK II.,Kept him from falling in that dangerous place.
879,BOOK II.,"And, from his heart, that goodness would adore"
880,BOOK II.,Which did preserve him 'midst such trials sore.
881,BOOK II.,"""Evil communications,"" God declares,"
882,BOOK II.,"""Corrupt good manners."" Who then boldly dares"
883,BOOK II.,To say their influence will not be seen
884,BOOK II.,In those who long exposed to them have been?
885,BOOK II.,"For, well we know, the unregenerate mind"
886,BOOK II.,Is proper soil wherein to seek and find
887,BOOK II.,"The seeds of latent evil, which may spring--"
888,BOOK II.,"And springing, grow, till they destruction bring."
889,BOOK II.,"Even so it was with WILLIAM'S carnal heart,"
890,BOOK II.,Some mischief settled in its fleshy part.
891,BOOK II.,Nor was this all; he oft became the butt
892,BOOK II.,"Of journeymen or 'prentice, who would glut"
893,BOOK II.,Their hardened hearts by showing greatest spite
894,BOOK II.,'Gainst him for following what he thought was right.
895,BOOK II.,"Often that wicked youth, in wantonness,"
896,BOOK II.,Would try all means to give him sore distress.
897,BOOK II.,"And once, with all a dreadful demon's rage--"
898,BOOK II.,In such acts none but demons would engage--
899,BOOK II.,"He threw him down, and held him; then applied"
900,BOOK II.,A lighted candle to his throat and tried
901,BOOK II.,To make him think it merely was a joke!
902,BOOK II.,Which was as true as most of what he spoke.
903,BOOK II.,"The sore thus made gave him most cruel pain,"
904,BOOK II.,And left a scar that does even now remain.
905,BOOK II.,
906,BOOK II.,"Bad as this was, it was not half so bad"
907,BOOK II.,As what was done unto another lad.
908,BOOK II.,"I heard the story, and believe it true--"
909,BOOK II.,And shudder while I have it in my view.
910,BOOK II.,
911,BOOK II.,The town in which this shocking act was done
912,BOOK II.,I have passed through--it was an English one.
913,BOOK II.,"The scene, a Tinsmith's shop, where several men"
914,BOOK II.,"Were wont to work, and all were present then."
915,BOOK II.,"A monster man two solder-irons took,"
916,BOOK II.,"Made them quite hot, and, with a fiendish look,"
917,BOOK II.,"Went right behind the boy, and on each side"
918,BOOK II.,The heated irons to his face applied!
919,BOOK II.,"The youth saw one, his head aside he threw,"
920,BOOK II.,"Received a burn, before his fate he knew;"
921,BOOK II.,"He quickly turned it then the other way,"
922,BOOK II.,And had two scars unto his dying day!
923,BOOK II.,
924,BOOK II.,"Methinks I hear the thoughtful reader ask,"
925,BOOK II.,"""Why was the man, at once, not ta'en to task?"
926,BOOK II.,Why did the other men not take a part
927,BOOK II.,"With that poor boy, and show a feeling heart?"""
928,BOOK II.,I am informed _they all enjoyed the joke!_
929,BOOK II.,Not one reproachful word they ever spoke.
930,BOOK II.,I blush to think that any of my trade
931,BOOK II.,Should of such monsters ever be afraid.
932,BOOK II.,The very thought still makes my blood to boil--
933,BOOK II.,"And shuddering, from such thoughts I back recoil!"
934,BOOK II.,"I would have dragged the fiend unto a jail,"
935,BOOK II.,"Or had him fastened to a wagon's tail,"
936,BOOK II.,"Laid bare his back, and let the lash descend--"
937,BOOK II.,"And, doing this, would still my act defend!"
938,BOOK II.,
939,BOOK II.,"Ye masters, foremen, journeymen, and all"
940,BOOK II.,"Who view such scenes, on each of you I call"
941,BOOK II.,To try your utmost now to do away
942,BOOK II.,"Such shocking deeds, enacted day by day!"
943,BOOK II.,"If this you do not, you deserve the blame,"
944,BOOK II.,And richly merit good men's scorn and shame.
945,BOOK II.,
946,BOOK II.,Our WILLIAM'S trials led him oft to think
947,BOOK II.,"That, while from duty he would never shrink,"
948,BOOK II.,"It would be better far to leave his trade,"
949,BOOK II.,Than the sad object of such sport be made.
950,BOOK II.,And to his father spoke to this effect--
951,BOOK II.,"Not in ill humor, but with much respect."
952,BOOK II.,"The father's counsel was, that he should stay."
953,BOOK II.,As soon the other youth would go away.
954,BOOK II.,
955,BOOK II.,"I here may mention he had one good friend,"
956,BOOK II.,And one on whom he always could depend;
957,BOOK II.,"This was his dear young master, who oft took"
958,BOOK II.,Much pains in reading o'er the Christian's Book--
959,BOOK II.,"Received its lessons in his gentle heart,"
960,BOOK II.,And showed by this he chose the better part.
961,BOOK II.,"He would encourage and defend the youth,"
962,BOOK II.,Who saw it right to let him know the truth.
963,BOOK II.,"Alas! this master soon was seized by Death,"
964,BOOK II.,"And died rejoicing in our ""common faith."""
965,BOOK II.,"COOPER with grief beheld the sorrowing scene,"
966,BOOK II.,And called to mind how kind that friend had been;
967,BOOK II.,And often wished more like to him were found
968,BOOK II.,In all the workshops through the country round.
969,BOOK II.,"Still time moved on; the elder youth took leave,"
970,BOOK II.,And those he left had no just cause to grieve.
971,BOOK II.,"'Twas WILLIAM'S turn to take the other's place,"
972,BOOK II.,And do his best to bring it no disgrace.
973,BOOK II.,"He now had under him a younger boy,"
974,BOOK II.,While better work did his own hands employ.
975,BOOK II.,"The workshop was a cellar, close to th' street,"
976,BOOK II.,And passers-by would oft the workmen greet.
977,BOOK II.,"The light came through an iron-grated space,"
978,BOOK II.,Making a prison-like and dismal place.
979,BOOK II.,
980,BOOK II.,"One day a stir was made that street within,"
981,BOOK II.,And each felt anxious to behold the scene.
982,BOOK II.,"The errand-boy was busy cleaning knives,"
983,BOOK II.,As others have done often in their lives.
984,BOOK II.,"He in a moment climbed upon the bench,"
985,BOOK II.,And the huge _carver_ in his hand did clench.
986,BOOK II.,"WILLIAM was looking up, with outstretched throat,"
987,BOOK II.,"Quite unobservant, being lost in thought."
988,BOOK II.,"""I'll cut! I'll cut!"" fell quickly on his ear;"
989,BOOK II.,"He felt sharp pain, and thus had cause to fear!"
990,BOOK II.,"The boy, for fun, across WILL'S neck had drawn"
991,BOOK II.,"The carving-knife, and stood still as a stone;"
992,BOOK II.,"Quite terrified at sight of blood, he said,"
993,BOOK II.,"""I thought it was th' _back!_"" it proved the edge instead."
994,BOOK II.,"The wound was slight, but might have been far worse--"
995,BOOK II.,And he might ne'er have figured in my verse.
996,BOOK II.,One thing the serious reader would expect--
997,BOOK II.,To give God thanks he could not well neglect.
998,BOOK II.,"Ah, me! his passion drove such thought away--"
999,BOOK II.,Strong Passion's call he hastened to obey;
1000,BOOK II.,"And feeling in a dreadful angry mood,"
1001,BOOK II.,He beat the boy that it might do him good!
1002,BOOK II.,"Yes, beat him without mercy, and declared"
1003,BOOK II.,"'Twas well, indeed, the lad no worse had fared!"
1004,BOOK II.,"God dealt not thus with thee, my hero fine,"
1005,BOOK II.,He long forbore with all those sins of thine;
1006,BOOK II.,"And 'twas but just thou should'st some mercy show,"
1007,BOOK II.,"To that poor boy, who did no better know."
1008,BOOK II.,
1009,BOOK II.,"My Muse, most willingly, would quit these themes--"
1010,BOOK II.,Which are not seemly in a poet's dreams.
1011,BOOK II.,"More pleasing topics now demand my pen,"
1012,BOOK II.,Though often sung by many wiser men.
1013,BOOK II.,The subject of my verse had early felt
1014,BOOK II.,That sensibility within him dwelt.
1015,BOOK II.,"So constituted was he, that at school,"
1016,BOOK II.,When he should have been conning grammar's rule--
1017,BOOK II.,In deep arithmetic--or other task--
1018,BOOK II.,"His eye would wander to a distant desk,"
1019,BOOK II.,"Which, having reached, itself it stationed there,"
1020,BOOK II.,Fixed on some beauty-bud of promise rare!
1021,BOOK II.,"'Twill not seem strange, then, if in after years"
1022,BOOK II.,This thing called Sensibility appears.
1023,BOOK II.,"Strange, or not strange, our hero's heart was warm,"
1024,BOOK II.,Which made him seek the other sex's charm;
1025,BOOK II.,And when his mind was brought to fix on one
1026,BOOK II.,"Who, in his eyes, all others far outshone--"
1027,BOOK II.,"He loved to ramble, on a moonlight night,"
1028,BOOK II.,With that dear girl--so charming in his sight--
1029,BOOK II.,"And listen to the murmuring of Kent's stream,"
1030,BOOK II.,Whose face reflected full each pale moonbeam;
1031,BOOK II.,"Or wander by the side of some lone wood,"
1032,BOOK II.,"In sweet discourse, which both considered good."
1033,BOOK II.,"Or else they clomb, delighted, up that hill,"
1034,BOOK II.,Upon whose top the Castle's ruins still
1035,BOOK II.,"Invite the mind, in pensiveness, to know"
1036,BOOK II.,The end of all things in this world below.
1037,BOOK II.,"Yes, these have stood within that gloomy place,"
1038,BOOK II.,Which now exhibits many a striking trace
1039,BOOK II.,"Of the rude ravages of Man and Time,"
1040,BOOK II.,As seen upon that edifice sublime.
1041,BOOK II.,"And, as he stood upon that green hill's brow,"
1042,BOOK II.,Has felt inclined abiding love to vow
1043,BOOK II.,"To her, who fondly on his arm was leaning"
1044,BOOK II.,"With upturned eyes, which well bespoke their meaning."
1045,BOOK II.,That place is sacred to such lovers' vows--
1046,BOOK II.,As could be witnessed by each tree that grows
1047,BOOK II.,Around those ruins; which have also seen
1048,BOOK II.,"Some sad, strange sights within their day, I ween!"
1049,BOOK II.,"Sometimes they chose to see a mutual friend,"
1050,BOOK II.,And in sweet singing would the evening spend.
1051,BOOK II.,"At other times through beauteous Gillingrove,"
1052,BOOK II.,[Footnote: A well-known lovers' retreat.]
1053,BOOK II.,"They, arm in arm, and rapt in love, would rove."
1054,BOOK II.,"This walk they mostly took on Sunday nights,"
1055,BOOK II.,As most in keeping with that day's delights.
1056,BOOK II.,For both had long quite strict attendants been
1057,BOOK II.,"At a small Chapel, thought to be too mean"
1058,BOOK II.,To be oft visited by wealthy men;
1059,BOOK II.,Though some would wander to it now and then.
1060,BOOK II.,"As yet nor WILLIAM, nor his girl, professed"
1061,BOOK II.,To be by saving Gospel Truth most bless'd;
1062,BOOK II.,"Yet both went there three times each Sabbath day,"
1063,BOOK II.,"To join in singing, if they did not pray."
1064,BOOK II.,And 'tis but right that Christian parents should
1065,BOOK II.,"To church take children, for the children's good."
1066,BOOK II.,To lead them to regard the Lord's own day--
1067,BOOK II.,Nor spend its hours in idleness or play.
1068,BOOK II.,"These two young people might be quite sincere,"
1069,BOOK II.,For all their friends could ever see or hear;
1070,BOOK II.,"But though their love was warm, and pure as day,"
1071,BOOK II.,Time spent in this wise runs to waste away.
1072,BOOK II.,"Of leisure he had never much to boast,"
1073,BOOK II.,For every work-day found him at his post;
1074,BOOK II.,"From six at morn till eight o'clock at night,"
1075,BOOK II.,"He faithful wrought, as in his Master's sight."
1076,BOOK II.,Yet oft he wished--that wish was strongest then--
1077,BOOK II.,Improvement in his _learning_ to obtain;
1078,BOOK II.,"But, such love frolics made that wish in vain."
1079,BOOK II.,"This grieved him much when, afterwards, desire"
1080,BOOK II.,He felt to nurture true poetic fire;
1081,BOOK II.,And did regret that youthful follies cost
1082,BOOK II.,So much in precious time forever lost.
1083,BOOK II.,"This folly seen, he strove with eager haste"
1084,BOOK II.,"To let his leisure run no more to waste,"
1085,BOOK II.,"And rose each morn at four or five o'clock,"
1086,BOOK II.,"To walk abroad, and gain of health a stock;"
1087,BOOK II.,"Or listen to the lark's sweet morning lay,"
1088,BOOK II.,As he rose up to greet the King of Day;
1089,BOOK II.,"Or let the lively, thrilling blackbird's song,"
1090,BOOK II.,Charm his fond ear as he walked slow along.
1091,BOOK II.,Sometimes through well-fenced fields of new-mown hay--
1092,BOOK II.,Breathing out fragrance--he was wont to stray;
1093,BOOK II.,"Or climb a bill with firm, elastic tread,"
1094,BOOK II.,While Sol his early beams in radiance shed.
1095,BOOK II.,"The Castle hill he mostly did prefer,"
1096,BOOK II.,As quite accordant with his character.
1097,BOOK II.,"Upon its ruins he would musing sit,"
1098,BOOK II.,Till he was seized with a strong rhyming fit;
1099,BOOK II.,Then frame his welling thoughts to some rude verse--
1100,BOOK II.,Which friends were anxious he should oft rehearse.
1101,BOOK II.,"If thus his leisure was not always spent,"
1102,BOOK II.,He read what books his friends had to him lent.
1103,BOOK II.,Of such good things he owned but very few--
1104,BOOK II.,And parents needed all the _cash_ he drew.
1105,BOOK II.,"Thus was his time most constantly employed,"
1106,BOOK II.,While life passed smoothly on--not unenjoyed.

1123,BOOK III.,
1124,BOOK III.,"Hail, Holidays! To you, with great delight,"
1125,BOOK III.,The schoolboy looks--exulting with his might
1126,BOOK III.,"At the fair prospect of enjoying play,"
1127,BOOK III.,Or visiting relations far away.
1128,BOOK III.,"Ere your propitious dawn he lays his schemes,"
1129,BOOK III.,"And pleased, rejoices in his bright day dreams."
1130,BOOK III.,"He, in anticipation, views the charm"
1131,BOOK III.,Of being for days exempt from birchen harm!
1132,BOOK III.,"When, free from tasks--nor caring much for books--"
1133,BOOK III.,With some companion he can fish the brooks;
1134,BOOK III.,"Can ramble through the woods for flowers or nuts,"
1135,BOOK III.,"Play with fair girls who live in sylvan huts,"
1136,BOOK III.,"Mount with agility some green hill top,"
1137,BOOK III.,"And, with a mate, roll full length down the slope;"
1138,BOOK III.,"Or take his fill from loaded bramble bushes,"
1139,BOOK III.,Or from rich fruit bedecked in Autumn's blushes.
1140,BOOK III.,"Such is the bliss that's placed before his view,"
1141,BOOK III.,"In all its fulness, Holidays! by you."
1142,BOOK III.,"And thus, without a single shade of sorrow,"
1143,BOOK III.,"He greets his mates with ""Holiday to-morrow!"""
1144,BOOK III.,These pleasures seem unto his boyish mind
1145,BOOK III.,Of the right sort--and for schoolboys designed.
1146,BOOK III.,He seldom thinks of all the anxious care
1147,BOOK III.,"His parents feel, to give their son a share"
1148,BOOK III.,"Of useful learning, that he may discharge"
1149,BOOK III.,"His part to God, to them, and men at large."
1150,BOOK III.,
1151,BOOK III.,Apprentices as well with pleasure hail
1152,BOOK III.,"Their holidays--_O, may they never fail!_"
1153,BOOK III.,"These are too often spent in idleness,"
1154,BOOK III.,Or such sad courses as brings them distress.
1155,BOOK III.,This is the case when grog-shops they frequent;
1156,BOOK III.,For ruin follows time and means ill spent.
1157,BOOK III.,"Pause, O, ye youths! before you yet begin"
1158,BOOK III.,A course that may lead you to every sin!
1159,BOOK III.,Restrain your feet from entering those _holes_
1160,BOOK III.,Which prove the ruin of so many souls.
1161,BOOK III.,"Would ye not pause, if right across your path"
1162,BOOK III.,"There lay a monstrous serpent, full of wrath?"
1163,BOOK III.,"Would we, fool-hardy, rush into his jaws"
1164,BOOK III.,To certain death? or would ye rather pause?
1165,BOOK III.,"Youths, ye have cause, yea, weighty cause, to dread"
1166,BOOK III.,"This horrid serpent, on strong liquor fed,"
1167,BOOK III.,"Which lurks in every place where _Rum_ is sold,"
1168,BOOK III.,Though they may be all covered o'er with gold--
1169,BOOK III.,They often are; nor deem it hard of faith--
1170,BOOK III.,The way to present and eternal death!
1171,BOOK III.,
1172,BOOK III.,"God does by His most holy Book declare,"
1173,BOOK III.,"""Into God's kingdom none shall enter there,"
1174,BOOK III.,"Who liquor drink till drunkards they become!"""
1175,BOOK III.,"Yet, day by day, some meet this awful doom."
1176,BOOK III.,"Oh, warning take! Flee from this dreadful crime!"
1177,BOOK III.,"Pause and consider, while you yet have time!"
1178,BOOK III.,
1179,BOOK III.,Listen the story which to you I tell;
1180,BOOK III.,Dwell on its moral--mark the sequel well;
1181,BOOK III.,"Then look abroad, and see its counterpart"
1182,BOOK III.,In many a case that shows a broken heart.
1183,BOOK III.,
1184,BOOK III.,"DAYCOURT was a youth, possessed of wealth--"
1185,BOOK III.,Had manly beauty and the best of health;
1186,BOOK III.,In learning he excelled--was quite a wit--
1187,BOOK III.,And oft indulged in a deep musing fit.
1188,BOOK III.,"Of very warm and truly tender heart,"
1189,BOOK III.,He did his best to act a proper part;
1190,BOOK III.,Which made him much respected all around--
1191,BOOK III.,"Against him, filled with envy, none were found."
1192,BOOK III.,"His widowed mother, then, might well be proud"
1193,BOOK III.,"Of such a son, and speak his praises loud."
1194,BOOK III.,"He bore for her respect, and strove to prove"
1195,BOOK III.,In many ways the fulness of his love.
1196,BOOK III.,
1197,BOOK III.,"For many years this widow, in her grief,"
1198,BOOK III.,"Looked up to God, and found from him relief."
1199,BOOK III.,"She knew the Lord, before her husband died,"
1200,BOOK III.,And found Him one in whom she could confide;
1201,BOOK III.,"In all her trials meekly bowed her head,"
1202,BOOK III.,And found sweet peace was o'er her bosom shed.
1203,BOOK III.,"Her son, to her, was all a son could be--"
1204,BOOK III.,Yet on one point she felt anxiety:
1205,BOOK III.,"He had not then experienced the New Birth,"
1206,BOOK III.,And his best thoughts had all been of the Earth.
1207,BOOK III.,
1208,BOOK III.,Adjoining their estate was living one--
1209,BOOK III.,"A blithe young lady, who in beauty shone;"
1210,BOOK III.,"With health endowed, and with fair learning graced,"
1211,BOOK III.,By wealth in easy circumstances placed.
1212,BOOK III.,AMELIA DOVE we well may call her name--
1213,BOOK III.,Like that sweet bird she seemed exempt from blame.
1214,BOOK III.,Her parents loved her--they could do no less--
1215,BOOK III.,She was the soul of all their happiness!
1216,BOOK III.,"Early she rose, and, dressed in neat array,"
1217,BOOK III.,Assisted her dear mother through the day.
1218,BOOK III.,"Thus passed her time, beloved by all around--"
1219,BOOK III.,She was as good a girl as could be found;
1220,BOOK III.,And a fair match for DAYCOURT all conceived--
1221,BOOK III.,This he himself had for some time believed.
1222,BOOK III.,"They loved each other, and obtained consent"
1223,BOOK III.,"From their kind parents, and were well content."
1224,BOOK III.,"And, having leisure, they would often walk,"
1225,BOOK III.,"Or, sitting in some bower, would sing and talk;"
1226,BOOK III.,"Or else they read some book which both admired,"
1227,BOOK III.,Till their young hearts with ecstacy were fired;
1228,BOOK III.,"Through hill and dale--through woods--were wont to rove,"
1229,BOOK III.,"Well pleased with all they saw, they drank in love!"
1230,BOOK III.,
1231,BOOK III.,The day arrived when DAYCOURT and his bride
1232,BOOK III.,Were at the altar in pure wedlock tied.
1233,BOOK III.,"The day was spent as such like days have been,"
1234,BOOK III.,And passed away in happiness serene.
1235,BOOK III.,"At night, a bounteous marriage-feast was spread,"
1236,BOOK III.,And Love's sweet influence over all seemed shed.
1237,BOOK III.,"The friends invited strove to show their joy,"
1238,BOOK III.,In wishing happiness without alloy
1239,BOOK III.,"To that young couple, who, in youthful bloom,"
1240,BOOK III.,Were the admired of all in that large room.
1241,BOOK III.,"But, Oh! I shrink! 'Tis my ungracious task"
1242,BOOK III.,From bliss like this to tear away the mask!
1243,BOOK III.,On such occasions wine's oft made to flow--
1244,BOOK III.,As if it were the source of joy below!
1245,BOOK III.,
1246,BOOK III.,"The bridegroom felt in a most merry mood,"
1247,BOOK III.,"And drank each _health_ till his young, joyous blood"
1248,BOOK III.,"Coursed through his veins as if quite all on fire,"
1249,BOOK III.,And his kind thoughts gave place to bad desire.
1250,BOOK III.,His brain began to whirl--he boisterous grew--
1251,BOOK III.,"All eyes on him, observant, quickly drew--"
1252,BOOK III.,"He seized a bottle, which he madly threw."
1253,BOOK III.,Sad to relate! it struck his beauteous bride!
1254,BOOK III.,"And she fell dead, by her dear mother's side."
1255,BOOK III.,"This dread catastrophe soon sobered him,"
1256,BOOK III.,"And he was sick, and felt his eyes grow dim."
1257,BOOK III.,"But while all stood in terror and dismay,"
1258,BOOK III.,"He roused himself, and fled from thence away;"
1259,BOOK III.,"Then headlong rushed into a deep, deep, stream--"
1260,BOOK III.,"And thus was ended that bright, youthful dream!"
1261,BOOK III.,"The pious mother tried in God to trust,"
1262,BOOK III.,But this dire blow soon sank her in the dust.
1263,BOOK III.,"Her parents, too, felt this most dreadful stroke"
1264,BOOK III.,"Too hard to bear, for both their hearts it broke!"
1265,BOOK III.,
1266,BOOK III.,"Oh, cruel Liquor! Thou hast millions slain,"
1267,BOOK III.,And still their death-throes cry to thee in vain!
1268,BOOK III.,Ten thousand broken hearts may soon be found
1269,BOOK III.,In almost every land the world around.
1270,BOOK III.,"Millions of orphans' cries thine ears assail,"
1271,BOOK III.,While parents' early death they loud bewail;
1272,BOOK III.,"The prisons and asylums which we build,"
1273,BOOK III.,From thy sad victims' ranks are chiefly filled.
1274,BOOK III.,War's dreadful ravages are justly blamed;
1275,BOOK III.,But war with thee deserves not to be named!
1276,BOOK III.,"And still, insatiate monster! thy dread jaws"
1277,BOOK III.,Are daily filled--being unrestrained by laws!
1278,BOOK III.,"When will the day, the happy day, arrive,"
1279,BOOK III.,When thee the injured nations forth shall drive?
1280,BOOK III.,
1281,BOOK III.,"Beware, Apprentices! In time beware!"
1282,BOOK III.,Flee from those places which would you insnare;
1283,BOOK III.,"Regard that man as your real enemy,"
1284,BOOK III.,"Who, tempting, leads to inebriety!"
1285,BOOK III.,"Now, while you daily toil, I wish you may"
1286,BOOK III.,Have many a truly happy holiday!
1287,BOOK III.,
1288,BOOK III.,"The hero of my tale of such had some,"
1289,BOOK III.,And felt well pleased whenever they did come.
1290,BOOK III.,On such occasions he was wont to go
1291,BOOK III.,"To visit friends, who did much kindness show."
1292,BOOK III.,"With ardent joy full beaming in his face,"
1293,BOOK III.,He more than once revisited the place
1294,BOOK III.,"Where his dear father spent his youthful days,"
1295,BOOK III.,"In toilsome labor, or in childish plays."
1296,BOOK III.,"To him 'twas still a sweetly quiet spot,"
1297,BOOK III.,"A picture of content--a small, neat cot--"
1298,BOOK III.,And just beneath the hill called _Farleton Knot_.
1299,BOOK III.,
1300,BOOK III.,"He had a strange, romantic turn of mind;"
1301,BOOK III.,To taste adventure ever felt inclined.
1302,BOOK III.,"This being premised, we may expect to see,"
1303,BOOK III.,That by slight dangers undeterred was he
1304,BOOK III.,"From venturing to the edge of precipice,"
1305,BOOK III.,To have a peep into some dark abyss.
1306,BOOK III.,"The hill of which I spoke has sometimes been,"
1307,BOOK III.,"As was well known, the site of tragic scene."
1308,BOOK III.,It is a solid mass of limestone rock--
1309,BOOK III.,And there oft falls some huge misshapen block.
1310,BOOK III.,On one occasion a poor quarryman
1311,BOOK III.,"Saw danger pending, and away he ran;"
1312,BOOK III.,'Twas all in vain! the lately-riven stone
1313,BOOK III.,"Came thundering down, and crushed his every bone!"
1314,BOOK III.,A tale like this might well some minds appal--
1315,BOOK III.,"But WILLIAM felt, just then, of dauntless soul;"
1316,BOOK III.,"And, with his cousin, hasted up the hill,"
1317,BOOK III.,With eager steps and most unyielding will;
1318,BOOK III.,"A scene there met his gaze which him repaid,"
1319,BOOK III.,And threw the toil required far in the shade.
1320,BOOK III.,
1321,BOOK III.,"On every hand a charming prospect lay,"
1322,BOOK III.,In all the beauty of a bright Spring day.
1323,BOOK III.,"All Nature smiled, in loveliest green confessed,"
1324,BOOK III.,Like a fair maiden for her bridal drest.
1325,BOOK III.,"And songsters of the grove, no longer sad,"
1326,BOOK III.,Their notes were warbling forth to make her glad.
1327,BOOK III.,"And need we wonder then, if there he stood,"
1328,BOOK III.,"With glowing heart, and wrapt in musing mood?"
1329,BOOK III.,"As was his wont, he felt a strong desire"
1330,BOOK III.,From such sweet views to draw poetic fire.
1331,BOOK III.,"And so it was, for out his numbers flowed,"
1332,BOOK III.,"Which, quickly penned, he on his friends bestowed."
1333,BOOK III.,"And though these numbers were but very rude,"
1334,BOOK III.,"They were, by rustic friends, with wonder viewed."
1335,BOOK III.,While he stood there his thoughts were backward thrown
1336,BOOK III.,To days which on Time's fleetest wing had flown--
1337,BOOK III.,"When his grandfather, in that humble cot,"
1338,BOOK III.,With sweet contentedness enjoyed his lot;
1339,BOOK III.,"Wrought quietly at his most lowly trade,"
1340,BOOK III.,And honest lived--though small the profits made.
1341,BOOK III.,"In his mind's eye, he saw his father climb"
1342,BOOK III.,"Those rugged cliffs, in youth, or manhood's prime;"
1343,BOOK III.,"Or, with his brothers join in lively play,"
1344,BOOK III.,On the long evenings of each Summer day.
1345,BOOK III.,Anon would view the time when each forsook
1346,BOOK III.,"That humble cottage, some fresh toil to brook;"
1347,BOOK III.,Saw them all settled in a wedded life--
1348,BOOK III.,"In honest work employed, exempt from strife."
1349,BOOK III.,Or glanced at some of his own early days--
1350,BOOK III.,"When he gave up, on Saturdays, his plays,"
1351,BOOK III.,"To go with his dear grandfather, to sell"
1352,BOOK III.,The neat _bee-hives_ the old man framed so well.
1353,BOOK III.,And often wondered what made selfish men
1354,BOOK III.,Try at less price those _bee-hives_ to obtain;
1355,BOOK III.,And why the tears would oft the eyes bedim
1356,BOOK III.,"Of that old man, when they thus bantered him?"
1357,BOOK III.,"And then with lightning speed his thoughts would stray,"
1358,BOOK III.,"To when his grandfather was ta'en away,"
1359,BOOK III.,To meet in church-yard with his kindred clay.
1360,BOOK III.,"As thus he stood and mused, his cousin's call"
1361,BOOK III.,Roused him again to consciousness of all
1362,BOOK III.,The widespread beauties of that landscape bright
1363,BOOK III.,"And he, reluctant, left the beauteous sight."
1364,BOOK III.,
1365,BOOK III.,"To hint at all he saw my time would fail,"
1366,BOOK III.,And might too much but lengthen out my tale.
1367,BOOK III.,"Suffice it, therefore, just for me to say,"
1368,BOOK III.,That he spent pleasantly each holiday.
1369,BOOK III.,
1370,BOOK III.,"Ere this, when he was in his fourteenth year,"
1371,BOOK III.,Amongst the Temperance ranks he did appear;
1372,BOOK III.,"Attended meetings, heard the speeches made,"
1373,BOOK III.,And grew indignant at the liquor trade.
1374,BOOK III.,"He signed the pledge--the strict ""teetotal"" pledge--"
1375,BOOK III.,And felt determined constant war to wage
1376,BOOK III.,"Against the huge, fierce monster, Drunkenness"
1377,BOOK III.,"Which caused, on every hand, such sore distress."
1378,BOOK III.,A drunken parent he had never had--
1379,BOOK III.,The Lord preserved him from a fate so sad!
1380,BOOK III.,"But still his fervent soul was filled with grief,"
1381,BOOK III.,"From which he vainly strove to gain relief,"
1382,BOOK III.,"So long as this dread vice o'erspread the land,"
1383,BOOK III.,"And strong drink's victims died, on every hand."
1384,BOOK III.,"He thought upon the thing till bold he grew,"
1385,BOOK III.,And framed a speech to tell of all he knew
1386,BOOK III.,"Of this vile demon's doings in the world,"
1387,BOOK III.,And wished that out of it he might be hurled.
1388,BOOK III.,
1389,BOOK III.,"Soon after this, from Canada there came"
1390,BOOK III.,A Christian man; no matter what his name.
1391,BOOK III.,"He long to WILLIAM'S parents had been known,"
1392,BOOK III.,And hospitality to him was shown.
1393,BOOK III.,"On that good country's merits much he dwelt,"
1394,BOOK III.,"And COOPER'S ears being open, soon he felt"
1395,BOOK III.,"A strong desire to reach that distant shore,"
1396,BOOK III.,And all its giant wonders to explore.
1397,BOOK III.,"Oft he had heard of its vast, splendid lakes,"
1398,BOOK III.,"Stupendous cataracts, and great cane-brakes;"
1399,BOOK III.,"Of boundless woods, well filled with noble trees"
1400,BOOK III.,And hugest rivers rolling to the seas.
1401,BOOK III.,"The man described quite well Niagara's falls,"
1402,BOOK III.,Its thundering sound as it o'erleaps its walls;
1403,BOOK III.,"He told the distance they could hear the sound,"
1404,BOOK III.,And how with ceaseless roar it shook the ground;
1405,BOOK III.,"Of Summer's heat, of the long Winter's cold,"
1406,BOOK III.,And at what price the finest lands were sold.
1407,BOOK III.,"This, and far more, the settler told the youth,"
1408,BOOK III.,"Who did regard it all as sterling truth,"
1409,BOOK III.,And wished--but wished in vain--that he was free
1410,BOOK III.,"To cross at once the stormy, deep blue sea."
1411,BOOK III.,No way appeared but quietly to wait
1412,BOOK III.,"Till he was loosed, and grown to man's estate."
1413,BOOK III.,"Some years must pass before that day arrive,"
1414,BOOK III.,So to be patient he thought fit to strive.
1415,BOOK III.,
1416,BOOK III.,"One-half of his apprenticeship had fled,"
1417,BOOK III.,And now he fairly earned his daily bread.
1418,BOOK III.,"Of clothes, his parents' ever constant care"
1419,BOOK III.,Provided him with quite a decent share.
1420,BOOK III.,"Of pocket money he ne'er had a store,"
1421,BOOK III.,"His needs supplied, he did not care for more;"
1422,BOOK III.,And his step-mother oft thought fit to say
1423,BOOK III.,"That ""money burned his pockets all away."""
1424,BOOK III.,"Howe'er it was, he never had a cent"
1425,BOOK III.,"But found a _hole_, and out of that it went!"
1426,BOOK III.,"Though still close-worked, he did contrive to spare"
1427,BOOK III.,"Some precious, time to spend in rhyming ware."
1428,BOOK III.,He read sweet COWPER'S poems through and through--
1429,BOOK III.,"And, more he read, the more he liked them, too;"
1430,BOOK III.,"His ""Task"" the most of all--an ample field--"
1431,BOOK III.,What heart-felt pleasure it did to him yield!
1432,BOOK III.,"Then MILTON'S lofty genius fired his soul,"
1433,BOOK III.,Nor did he tire till he had read the whole.
1434,BOOK III.,"Again began, and o'er the pages pored,"
1435,BOOK III.,And drank the sweets with which they are well stored.
1436,BOOK III.,"Then THOMPSON'S _Seasons_ with delight he read,"
1437,BOOK III.,And YOUNG'S _Night Thoughts_ in mournful dress arrayed.
1438,BOOK III.,"Some few sweet pieces he from BYRON drew,"
1439,BOOK III.,"And read poor BURNS with much advantage, too."
1440,BOOK III.,"But of all poets he loved COWPER most,"
1441,BOOK III.,For in Miltonic grandeur he was lost;
1442,BOOK III.,And THOMSON lacked that great variety
1443,BOOK III.,Which in sweet Olney's bard we clearly see.
1444,BOOK III.,"Afflicted Poet! Thou didst well thy part,"
1445,BOOK III.,By pouring balm into the wounded heart;
1446,BOOK III.,"And while the world endures, thy verse will cheer"
1447,BOOK III.,"Poor down-cast souls, and bid them not to fear!"
1448,BOOK III.,
1449,BOOK III.,"Nor did he read alone the poet's page,"
1450,BOOK III.,Good books in prose would oft his mind engage:
1451,BOOK III.,For he had joined th' Mechanics' Institute--
1452,BOOK III.,And in its praises I would not be mute.
1453,BOOK III.,"Mechanics! It deserves your best support,"
1454,BOOK III.,And to its rooms you often should resort.
1455,BOOK III.,"There you may learn from books to act your parts,"
1456,BOOK III.,While they refine and elevate your hearts.
1457,BOOK III.,
1458,BOOK III.,He with great travelers took delight to roam
1459,BOOK III.,"In distant countries, far away from home;"
1460,BOOK III.,And frequently has dropped a silent tear
1461,BOOK III.,O'er PARK'S great trials in the desert drear.
1462,BOOK III.,Oh! who can read of all his heart-felt woes--
1463,BOOK III.,"His frequent sufferings, and his dying throes--"
1464,BOOK III.,And fail to drop a sympathetic tear
1465,BOOK III.,For his sad end--without a friend to cheer!
1466,BOOK III.,
1467,BOOK III.,"In LANDERS' patient, persevering toil,"
1468,BOOK III.,"Through greatest dangers, on wild Afric's soil,"
1469,BOOK III.,"He felt the deepest interest, and partook"
1470,BOOK III.,"Their joys and sorrows, while he read their book."
1471,BOOK III.,"And hailed, with pleasure and unfeigned delight,"
1472,BOOK III.,The happy moment when the welcome sight
1473,BOOK III.,Of Niger's junction with the great deep sea
1474,BOOK III.,A period put to their sad misery!
1475,BOOK III.,
1476,BOOK III.,"Read BRUCE, whose book, received with cold distrust,"
1477,BOOK III.,Was only prized when he was laid in dust.
1478,BOOK III.,"And HUMBOLDT, the admired of all mankind,"
1479,BOOK III.,Of gentle manners and accomplished mind;
1480,BOOK III.,"Who scaled the lofty Andes' snow-clad towers,"
1481,BOOK III.,"Where danger lurks, and fell destruction lowers."
1482,BOOK III.,"And COOK, who bravely sailed around the Earth--"
1483,BOOK III.,A friend to man--ev'n man of lowest birth.
1484,BOOK III.,Whose peaceful voyages to each far coast
1485,BOOK III.,Were for man's benefit--as we may boast---
1486,BOOK III.,"Yet at sad price, since his dear life was lost!"
1487,BOOK III.,"Of warlike heroes' lives he read a few,"
1488,BOOK III.,And of War's horrors thus obtained a view--
1489,BOOK III.,"Which made him sick at heart, nor wish to know"
1490,BOOK III.,More of man's bloody doings here below.
1491,BOOK III.,
1492,BOOK III.,His sober and industrious conduct gained
1493,BOOK III.,The Master's confidence--which he retained;
1494,BOOK III.,"And so, in services requiring trust"
1495,BOOK III.,"He was employed, and still continued just."
1496,BOOK III.,Sometimes to distant places he was sent--
1497,BOOK III.,And well he did enjoy the time thus spent.
1498,BOOK III.,It scope afforded to reflective powers--
1499,BOOK III.,And thus he profited by these spare hours.
1500,BOOK III.,Greatly did it delight him to behold
1501,BOOK III.,Fair Nature glittering in green and gold:
1502,BOOK III.,And the pure melody in different groves
1503,BOOK III.,Reminded him of his own early loves;
1504,BOOK III.,"Or led him to break out, with tuneful voice,"
1505,BOOK III.,"In some sweet hymn, which made his heart rejoice."
1506,BOOK III.,For he had now begun to feel the worth
1507,BOOK III.,"Of Heavenly things, and pour God's praises forth."
1508,BOOK III.,
1509,BOOK III.,"In this way, once he passed through Dallam Park,"
1510,BOOK III.,"To see its deer, and other objects mark."
1511,BOOK III.,These lovely creatures to his mind did seem
1512,BOOK III.,Most unfit objects of man's sporting dream.
1513,BOOK III.,He greatly wondered how some men could be
1514,BOOK III.,"E'er guilty of, such wanton cruelty,"
1515,BOOK III.,"As to pursue, with horses and with hounds,"
1516,BOOK III.,Such harmless creature over all their grounds;
1517,BOOK III.,"Hunt him o'er swamps and fields, and mountain slopes,"
1518,BOOK III.,"Through pebbly streams, or shady hazel copse,"
1519,BOOK III.,"Till they have driven him at last to bay,"
1520,BOOK III.,Toward the close of some most sultry day.
1521,BOOK III.,"Wondered how any one, with tearless eye,"
1522,BOOK III.,"Could mark his sufferings, and then watch him die."
1523,BOOK III.,"Oh, cruel man! when will thy thirst for blood"
1524,BOOK III.,Be turned to energy in doing good?
1525,BOOK III.,"When will Creation's groans come to an end,"
1526,BOOK III.,And men delight in love their days to spend?
1527,BOOK III.,"While such reflections occupied his mind,"
1528,BOOK III.,"The place he went to seek he strives to find,"
1529,BOOK III.,"And is successful; gets his business done,"
1530,BOOK III.,Then back pursues his homeward way alone.
1531,BOOK III.,
1532,BOOK III.,Now Fancy wings her flight; I view again
1533,BOOK III.,Scenes which my memory will long retain;
1534,BOOK III.,See Kent--unsung--flow on in winding course
1535,BOOK III.,"Through woods and fields, with very gentle force;"
1536,BOOK III.,"Or where, by Sedgwick's side, its waters pour"
1537,BOOK III.,"O'er jagged rocks, with never-ceasing roar;"
1538,BOOK III.,"Or where they smoothly glide past Leven's hall,"
1539,BOOK III.,"Sweet landscapes forming, which can never pall"
1540,BOOK III.,"The minds of those who love a beauteous scene,"
1541,BOOK III.,And wish to spend a day in bliss serene.
1542,BOOK III.,For there this stream just flows as if by stealth
1543,BOOK III.,Through splendid parks--past gardens formed by wealth!
1544,BOOK III.,I oft look back to those most gladsome hours
1545,BOOK III.,"Spent, while a schoolboy, in those garden bowers;"
1546,BOOK III.,Where tall box-trees are trimmed to various shapes--
1547,BOOK III.,"Old women--pitchers--or, it may be--_apes!_"
1548,BOOK III.,"Where plants and beauteous flowers are ever found,"
1549,BOOK III.,To breathe out fragrance all the garden round.
1550,BOOK III.,
1551,BOOK III.,'Tis time for me to curb my vagrant Muse;
1552,BOOK III.,A subject waits my pen she well may choose.
1553,BOOK III.,"Now aid me, O my God! who dwell'st above,"
1554,BOOK III.,While I attempt to sing Redeeming Love!
1555,BOOK III.,"Nor let one line, or word, be writ by me"
1556,BOOK III.,Not in accordance with that Mystery!
1557,BOOK III.,"May I, to profit fellow-sinners, strive,"
1558,BOOK III.,And good from this for my own soul derive.

1630,BOOK IV.,"Was led to view God's holy law aright,"
1631,BOOK IV.,And know he was condemned in His just sight.
1632,BOOK IV.,"Then, what true joy did Jesus' love inspire!"
1633,BOOK IV.,It kindled in his heart sincere desire
1634,BOOK IV.,"To leave, at once, the World's wild, giddy throng,"
1635,BOOK IV.,"Whose joy and pleasures all to Earth belong,"
1636,BOOK IV.,"To join with those whose joys are from Above,"
1637,BOOK IV.,And who have tasted of a Savior's love.
1638,BOOK IV.,"He, with a choice companion, then applied"
1639,BOOK IV.,For Christian fellowship; nor was denied.
1640,BOOK IV.,"All those kind brethren hearty welcome gave,"
1641,BOOK IV.,For each was glad a sinner's soul to save.
1642,BOOK IV.,"And joyful praises straight to God ascend,"
1643,BOOK IV.,To whom the new-made members they commend.
1644,BOOK IV.,"An Elder, grave, gave each an exhortation,"
1645,BOOK IV.,To which their hearts respond in approbation.
1646,BOOK IV.,
1647,BOOK IV.,"Soon COOPER felt new life, new aims, new themes--"
1648,BOOK IV.,Which gave fresh turns to all his youthful dreams.
1649,BOOK IV.,The Bible then became his choicest friend;
1650,BOOK IV.,"At home, abroad, did all his steps attend,"
1651,BOOK IV.,And its blest influence was known to lend.
1652,BOOK IV.,
1653,BOOK IV.,Now what a different aspect things assume;
1654,BOOK IV.,"What once was darkness, Gospel truths illume!"
1655,BOOK IV.,In the sweet services of Sabbath days
1656,BOOK IV.,He takes delight--in spirit sings and prays.
1657,BOOK IV.,Views Family Worship as an altar raised
1658,BOOK IV.,"To the true God, who should be always praised."
1659,BOOK IV.,"And now, whene'er he takes his walks abroad,"
1660,BOOK IV.,Hears Nature's voice well tuned in praise of God.
1661,BOOK IV.,"Each blade of grass that springs beneath his feet,"
1662,BOOK IV.,"The new-made hay, in Summer's fragrance sweet,"
1663,BOOK IV.,"The flowers that to his eyes their charms disclose,"
1664,BOOK IV.,"The waving grain, and every tree that grows,"
1665,BOOK IV.,"Each insect fluttering in the bright sunbeams,"
1666,BOOK IV.,"Or fishes sporting in pure crystal streams,"
1667,BOOK IV.,"Or birds that raise their songs by morning light,"
1668,BOOK IV.,"At High mid day, or through the moonlit night;"
1669,BOOK IV.,"Each storm that rises, or pure breeze that blows,"
1670,BOOK IV.,"The copious rains, or Winter's drifting snows,"
1671,BOOK IV.,"Vast mountains rearing their hoar heads on high,"
1672,BOOK IV.,Each gem-like star set in the fair blue sky;
1673,BOOK IV.,"The herds wide feeding in the fields around,"
1674,BOOK IV.,"All living things in every country found,"
1675,BOOK IV.,All these in their peculiar ways give forth
1676,BOOK IV.,"Praises to God, the Author of their birth!"
1677,BOOK IV.,"""Then, why are _Men_ so silent?"" he'd exclaim;"
1678,BOOK IV.,"""And, those especially, who know His name:"
1679,BOOK IV.,"Who, through His grace, enjoy a heavenly birth,"
1680,BOOK IV.,"Why rise they not above the things of Earth?"""
1681,BOOK IV.,"The ""_why_"" to WILLIAM, in his warm first love,"
1682,BOOK IV.,Did truly seem most difficult to prove.
1683,BOOK IV.,He by experience knew but little then
1684,BOOK IV.,Of the sad trials of his fellow men;
1685,BOOK IV.,Nor e'er suspected that _the flesh_ remains
1686,BOOK IV.,In each poor sinner who true faith obtains.
1687,BOOK IV.,"This bitter truth he soon was made to feel,"
1688,BOOK IV.,Which greatly damped his young and ardent zeal.
1689,BOOK IV.,How humbling was the thought that human pride
1690,BOOK IV.,Within God's children must be mortified!
1691,BOOK IV.,"""Salvation all of Grace"" first cuts the roots,"
1692,BOOK IV.,"Then the huge blanches, and the smallest shoots,"
1693,BOOK IV.,"Lays bare the fact, that all of Adam's race"
1694,BOOK IV.,"Are but vile sinners, and in woful case."
1695,BOOK IV.,"That the most _moral_ among human kind,"
1696,BOOK IV.,"As the most vicious, are to sin inclined."
1697,BOOK IV.,"And if not saved by Grace, not saved at all,"
1698,BOOK IV.,"But are hell-doomed, and held in Satan's thrall!"
1699,BOOK IV.,"While endless ruin stands before their view,"
1700,BOOK IV.,And does with slavish fear their minds imbue.
1701,BOOK IV.,
1702,BOOK IV.,"This Scripture truth was soon by WILLIAM seen,"
1703,BOOK IV.,For he had from his very childhood been
1704,BOOK IV.,"Used to the teachings of God's holy word,"
1705,BOOK IV.,So that with it his mind was early stored.
1706,BOOK IV.,However strange indeed it may appear
1707,BOOK IV.,"To some men's minds, he felt no cause to fear:"
1708,BOOK IV.,For though this truth had stripped him of all worth
1709,BOOK IV.,"In sight of God, it called his praises forth,"
1710,BOOK IV.,By showing him Salvation full and free
1711,BOOK IV.,"To sinners, whatsoe'er their age, sex or degree,"
1712,BOOK IV.,Who credit the account that God has given
1713,BOOK IV.,Of Jesus Christ--the precious gift of Heaven!
1714,BOOK IV.,"Now, feeling truly happy in his soul,"
1715,BOOK IV.,He felt most free to speak the Truth to all;
1716,BOOK IV.,"That, if by any means, he might succeed"
1717,BOOK IV.,"In saving souls, of whatsoever creed."
1718,BOOK IV.,"His shop-mates saw the difference with surprise,"
1719,BOOK IV.,And at his cost indulged in foul surmise.
1720,BOOK IV.,"He heeded not, but placed in God his trust--"
1721,BOOK IV.,To his employer still continued just--
1722,BOOK IV.,And strove with all his might to rectify
1723,BOOK IV.,Each thing improper which he chanced to spy;
1724,BOOK IV.,That his old master might have no complaint
1725,BOOK IV.,Against his servant for thus turning Saint.
1726,BOOK IV.,"He plied his trade from better motives now,"
1727,BOOK IV.,"As God with wisdom did his mind endow,"
1728,BOOK IV.,And to his just commands led him to bow.
1729,BOOK IV.,By such a course pursued he did enjoy
1730,BOOK IV.,True peace of mind--though not without alloy.
1731,BOOK IV.,"And Time, who past him flew on fleetest wing,"
1732,BOOK IV.,"New joys, new sorrows, to his mind did bring."
1733,BOOK IV.,"At times he still was caught in Love's sweet snare,"
1734,BOOK IV.,Which of fresh trials brought no little share.
1735,BOOK IV.,He was by nature very apt to fall
1736,BOOK IV.,"So deep in love, it did his mind enthral."
1737,BOOK IV.,"Yet clothed in purity was his desire,"
1738,BOOK IV.,Nor e'er to rank unequal did aspire.
1739,BOOK IV.,One thing to this time had his thoughts possessed--
1740,BOOK IV.,"""To have the girl that pleased his fancy best."""
1741,BOOK IV.,He had not noticed what the Word declares
1742,BOOK IV.,"On this great matter, so that in his prayers"
1743,BOOK IV.,"He ne'er had asked the Lord to him direct,"
1744,BOOK IV.,And disappointment came for this neglect.
1745,BOOK IV.,'Midst doubts and fears he therefore put away
1746,BOOK IV.,All thoughts of marriage to a future day.
1747,BOOK IV.,
1748,BOOK IV.,"When we regard the record of God's will,"
1749,BOOK IV.,A duty to ourselves we best fulfil!
1750,BOOK IV.,"From past experience, I would now advise"
1751,BOOK IV.,"That all young men, in this respect, be wise."
1752,BOOK IV.,"Few weightier matters can attention claim,"
1753,BOOK IV.,"If at pure peace and happiness we aim,"
1754,BOOK IV.,Than the selection of a proper wife--
1755,BOOK IV.,One that may be a true help-mate for life.
1756,BOOK IV.,"""A prudent wife from God alone can come,"""
1757,BOOK IV.,And only such can make a happy home.
1758,BOOK IV.,"What dreadful strife, what wretchedness and woe,"
1759,BOOK IV.,From error here is almost sure to flow!
1760,BOOK IV.,
1761,BOOK IV.,"'Tis Sabbath morn, a pleasant, one, in Spring,"
1762,BOOK IV.,And Nature's varied voice is tuned to sing.
1763,BOOK IV.,"The swallows twitter underneath the eaves,"
1764,BOOK IV.,And zephyrs stir the newly-opened leaves;
1765,BOOK IV.,"The cock's loud crowing sounds on every hand,"
1766,BOOK IV.,Each bird is warbling praises through the land.
1767,BOOK IV.,Young COOPER thinks it were indeed a sin
1768,BOOK IV.,If he to tune his harp did not begin.
1769,BOOK IV.,"He rises from his bed, pours forth his praise"
1770,BOOK IV.,To his Preserver in some artless lays;
1771,BOOK IV.,"Then quickly dresses, and, though humbly born,"
1772,BOOK IV.,With mind elate he tastes the sweets of morn.
1773,BOOK IV.,"And such a morn! Ah, who would he abed,"
1774,BOOK IV.,That has the power to taste these sweets instead.
1775,BOOK IV.,"Most grateful odors greet the well-charmed sense,"
1776,BOOK IV.,From blooming fruit-trees o'er yon garden fence;
1777,BOOK IV.,The sweet wild-flowers amid the new-sprung grass
1778,BOOK IV.,Make it seem carpeted in Fancy's glass.
1779,BOOK IV.,And it a carpet proves to those blithe lambs
1780,BOOK IV.,Which play around their several watchful dams.
1781,BOOK IV.,"All Nature smiles in loveliest green attire,"
1782,BOOK IV.,And seems to manifest a strong desire
1783,BOOK IV.,"To speak the praise of All-Creating Power,"
1784,BOOK IV.,"In striking language, at this early hour."
1785,BOOK IV.,"She, bursting forth from Winter's cold embrace,"
1786,BOOK IV.,Exulting leaves behind his every trace.
1787,BOOK IV.,"So, on the morning of this hallowed day,"
1788,BOOK IV.,The Savior tore the bars of Death away.
1789,BOOK IV.,"He Resurrection-truth brought forth to light,"
1790,BOOK IV.,And we with rapture hail the glorious sight.
1791,BOOK IV.,"Now hark! that sound fast floating on the breeze,"
1792,BOOK IV.,And streaming forth from 'midst those dark yew trees
1793,BOOK IV.,"'Tis church-bell music! and peal follows peal,"
1794,BOOK IV.,Till strong emotions we begin to feel.
1795,BOOK IV.,Now it pours full on the delighted ear;
1796,BOOK IV.,"Soon, changing with the wind, the strains we hear"
1797,BOOK IV.,"As if the bells were many miles away,"
1798,BOOK IV.,And some few tones had merely chanced to stay!
1799,BOOK IV.,"Again, it comes in full harmonious swell,"
1800,BOOK IV.,With thrilling power--as I remember well.
1801,BOOK IV.,
1802,BOOK IV.,"Thus pleased in mind, WILLIAM his way now wends"
1803,BOOK IV.,"Toward a hill, which he at once ascends;"
1804,BOOK IV.,"And thence pursues the road to Birkland's farm,"
1805,BOOK IV.,Where from kind friends he meets reception warm.
1806,BOOK IV.,The aged matron--since in grave-yard laid--
1807,BOOK IV.,Was wont to render him her friendly aid
1808,BOOK IV.,In shape of counsel--or delicious fare--
1809,BOOK IV.,Of which good things he needed then a share.
1810,BOOK IV.,"The breakfast over, straight the Bible's brought,"
1811,BOOK IV.,A proper chapter found as soon as sought;
1812,BOOK IV.,"Remarks are made, or they some question ask:"
1813,BOOK IV.,To gain instruction proves a pleasing task.
1814,BOOK IV.,"This done, sweet hymns of praise to God arise."
1815,BOOK IV.,
1816,BOOK IV.,From well tuned hearts--a joyful sacrifice!
1817,BOOK IV.,"Then, on their knees, in fervent prayer they join"
1818,BOOK IV.,"To Him, their Savior and their Friend benign."
1819,BOOK IV.,"Give thanks for care extended through the night,"
1820,BOOK IV.,And blessings they enjoy at morning light.
1821,BOOK IV.,Not only Sabbath days they thus began;
1822,BOOK IV.,"On, week-days, too, it was their constant plan"
1823,BOOK IV.,"To join in worship every night and morn,"
1824,BOOK IV.,That the Religion ever might adorn.
1825,BOOK IV.,"By this made fit to meet the ills of life,"
1826,BOOK IV.,They were preserved from much of worldly strife:
1827,BOOK IV.,"""Surely,"" thought WILLIAM, ""God will deign to bless"
1828,BOOK IV.,"This worthy family with rich happiness!"""
1829,BOOK IV.,"Ev'n so he did; all seven knew the Lord,"
1830,BOOK IV.,"And took, to guide them, His most holy Word."
1831,BOOK IV.,
1832,BOOK IV.,"England! whate'er thy foes may do or say,"
1833,BOOK IV.,"Thousands of families for thee will pray,"
1834,BOOK IV.,By love and duty led. They will not cease
1835,BOOK IV.,To seek that God would bless thy shores with peace!
1836,BOOK IV.,"Know thou, my Country! thy great naval store,"
1837,BOOK IV.,"Thy numerous armies, and thy cannon's roar,"
1838,BOOK IV.,"Are _Impotence_ itself compared with prayer,"
1839,BOOK IV.,Poured forth from hearts which in thy blessings share!
1840,BOOK IV.,
1841,BOOK IV.,"Refreshed in mind and body, to the road,"
1842,BOOK IV.,"With good companions from that dear abode,"
1843,BOOK IV.,WILLIAM returns; and in most pleasing talk
1844,BOOK IV.,"Time swiftly flies, while each enjoys the walk."
1845,BOOK IV.,"They reach the School before the time begin,"
1846,BOOK IV.,When each prepares some precious soul to win.
1847,BOOK IV.,"They, having tasted God's forgiving love,"
1848,BOOK IV.,"Their gratitude for that rich blessing prove,"
1849,BOOK IV.,By teaching children placed beneath their care
1850,BOOK IV.,"How they may best escape from every snare,"
1851,BOOK IV.,"Be saved from hell, and reach heaven's mansions bright,"
1852,BOOK IV.,To dwell forever in the Savior's sight.
1853,BOOK IV.,
1854,BOOK IV.,"In Sunday School engaged twice each Lord's day,"
1855,BOOK IV.,"And hearing three discourses, some would say"
1856,BOOK IV.,No time could then remain for aught beside;
1857,BOOK IV.,"But this, my friends, has only to be tried."
1858,BOOK IV.,"For COOPER, in reserve, two hours still kept"
1859,BOOK IV.,"An Elder's invitation to accept,"
1860,BOOK IV.,"Him to accompany to his home, and there"
1861,BOOK IV.,"Join in sweet conversation, hymn or prayer."
1862,BOOK IV.,"Thus mostly passed his Sabbaths for two years,"
1863,BOOK IV.,Which kept him free from many doubts and fears;
1864,BOOK IV.,Enabled him to work at business still
1865,BOOK IV.,"With easy mind, and with right hearty will,"
1866,BOOK IV.,"And find that Wisdom's ways are pleasantness,"
1867,BOOK IV.,While all her paths are peace and heart-felt bliss.
1868,BOOK IV.,
1869,BOOK IV.,"But little now remains for us to note,"
1870,BOOK IV.,"Of grief endured, or of true pleasure sought,"
1871,BOOK IV.,"While he remained in his dear native place,"
1872,BOOK IV.,The pain of leaving which he had to face.
1873,BOOK IV.,"Except Religion, he had but one theme,"
1874,BOOK IV.,That much engaged his mind in each day-dream.
1875,BOOK IV.,"This one was Emigration, which increased"
1876,BOOK IV.,In strength till his apprenticeship had ceased.
1877,BOOK IV.,Accounts from different Colonies he read--
1878,BOOK IV.,"Their capabilities, and state of trade;"
1879,BOOK IV.,"The various climates next he pondered o'er,"
1880,BOOK IV.,And Canada preferred still more and more.
1881,BOOK IV.,"He learned, indeed, the heat and cold were great;"
1882,BOOK IV.,But thought that Nature's works would compensate
1883,BOOK IV.,For what one suffered from her climate's rigor;
1884,BOOK IV.,So preparation soon was made with vigor.
1885,BOOK IV.,"His father's family no objection raised,"
1886,BOOK IV.,As they had friends there who the country praised.
1887,BOOK IV.,Yet all thought well to seek the Lord's direction;
1888,BOOK IV.,Secure His aid and fatherly protection.
1889,BOOK IV.,"This done, they did no longer hesitate"
1890,BOOK IV.,To take the steps required in change so great.
1891,BOOK IV.,The kind employers of both man and son
1892,BOOK IV.,Showed plainly that their confidence was won;
1893,BOOK IV.,Each made them offers if they would remain--
1894,BOOK IV.,Of which they had no reason to complain.
1895,BOOK IV.,"The sire, at that one place, employed had been"
1896,BOOK IV.,"For something over twenty years, I ween."
1897,BOOK IV.,There he wrought hard--but for a decent wage--
1898,BOOK IV.,And was approaching fast toward old age;
1899,BOOK IV.,"So, dare not longer such a place engage."
1900,BOOK IV.,While William's natural romantic turn
1901,BOOK IV.,"Led him all offers, good and ill, to spurn."
1902,BOOK IV.,"He thought of little but Canadian farms,"
1903,BOOK IV.,"And heeded not Rebellion's loud alarms,"
1904,BOOK IV.,[Footnote: The Rebellion of 1837.]
1905,BOOK IV.,"Which his old master pointed out to him,"
1906,BOOK IV.,To put a stop to such a foolish whim.
1907,BOOK IV.,Yet it caused them sincerest grief of heart
1908,BOOK IV.,"From all kind friends and relatives to part,"
1909,BOOK IV.,Without a prospect of beholding more
1910,BOOK IV.,"Each much-loved face, on dear Old England's shore."
1911,BOOK IV.,
1912,BOOK IV.,"At last arrived that most important day,"
1913,BOOK IV.,"When they from all must tear themselves away,"
1914,BOOK IV.,"And feel, what Emigrants had felt before,"
1915,BOOK IV.,That parting scenes to tender hearts are sore.
1916,BOOK IV.,Their Christian brethren did them all commend
1917,BOOK IV.,"To their kind Father, Savior, Guide and Friend,"
1918,BOOK IV.,"And gave to them, as pledge of their regard,"
1919,BOOK IV.,A Bagster's Bible--God's own precious Word.
1920,BOOK IV.,"Their kind, deep feelings, other friends displayed"
1921,BOOK IV.,"By various gifts, till parting time delayed."
1922,BOOK IV.,And these love-tokens sensibly affect
1923,BOOK IV.,"The Emigrants, as proof of their respect;"
1924,BOOK IV.,"And often, when they view them even now,"
1925,BOOK IV.,A shade might seem to cross each thoughtful brow.
1926,BOOK IV.,
1927,BOOK IV.,"Association, most mysterious thing!"
1928,BOOK IV.,What striking wonders thou hast power to bring!
1929,BOOK IV.,"Aided by thee, we can review each day"
1930,BOOK IV.,"A hundred scenes, though thousand miles away,"
1931,BOOK IV.,"A single thought, amidst much happiness,"
1932,BOOK IV.,May call up others which give sore distress.
1933,BOOK IV.,"At other times, reverse of this is true,"
1934,BOOK IV.,Most pleasing things are placed before our view.
1935,BOOK IV.,But to return; the first of May appears--
1936,BOOK IV.,A day for fond embrace and shedding tears!
1937,BOOK IV.,"Some few go with the friends to see them off,"
1938,BOOK IV.,"Nor seek to hide their tears, though fools may scoff."
1939,BOOK IV.,They take the boat; the signal's made to start;
1940,BOOK IV.,"The _""Water-Witch""_ shoots forward like a dart;"
1941,BOOK IV.,"Some lingering looks, some tokens of adieu--"
1942,BOOK IV.,"Sweet town, dear friends, and all, is lost to view!"
1943,BOOK IV.,Why felt not COOPER then in rhyming mood?
1944,BOOK IV.,"Why did he slight the Muse, who should be wooed?"
1945,BOOK IV.,Why did he not pour forth a parting song
1946,BOOK IV.,Expressive of his feelings--always strong?
1947,BOOK IV.,"His loving heart was painfully oppressed,"
1948,BOOK IV.,As for some nights he had but little rest;
1949,BOOK IV.,"Most weighty cares, too, seemed his mind to fill,"
1950,BOOK IV.,Or he might then have sung with right good will.
1951,BOOK IV.,"They onward sail, and PRESTON reach at noon;"
1952,BOOK IV.,Then take the coach and travel further on.
1953,BOOK IV.,"At night they gain the port of LIVERPOOL,"
1954,BOOK IV.,"All greatly chilled, because the night was cool."
1955,BOOK IV.,"Dear relatives who live there, welcome give,"
1956,BOOK IV.,And take them to the house in which they live.
1957,BOOK IV.,"Next day they visit many different docks,"
1958,BOOK IV.,"Or wondering view the buildings huge, in blocks."
1959,BOOK IV.,"Then seek a proper ship without delay,"
1960,BOOK IV.,"And, having found one, passage money pay;"
1961,BOOK IV.,"Secure their berths, and place their goods on board,"
1962,BOOK IV.,"Commend themselves and friends unto the Lord,"
1963,BOOK IV.,And buy such comforts as their means afford.
1964,BOOK IV.,"Mistakes about the charges, and delays,"
1965,BOOK IV.,Gave them uneasiness for several days.
1966,BOOK IV.,At last the vessel's towed toward the sea;
1967,BOOK IV.,"And, Reader, for the present, rest with me;"
1968,BOOK IV.,Or wait a moment while I briefly add
1969,BOOK IV.,"That they, to leave this port, were truly glad!"

1986,BOOK V.,
1987,BOOK V.,"Hail, peaceful Commerce! in thy glorious train"
1988,BOOK V.,Rich blessings come to those who thee maintain.
1989,BOOK V.,England by thee for centuries has been blest;
1990,BOOK V.,Thy worth to her can scarcely be express'd.
1991,BOOK V.,By thy facilities the Scriptures spread
1992,BOOK V.,"From shore to shore, on God's own errands sped!"
1993,BOOK V.,"Impelled by thee our ships proud Ocean bears,"
1994,BOOK V.,While each fair port a thriving aspect wears.
1995,BOOK V.,"Millions of gold by thee are well employed,"
1996,BOOK V.,And the rich profits by each class enjoyed.
1997,BOOK V.,Through thee great Nature's overflowing stores
1998,BOOK V.,From distant lands are brought unto our doors;
1999,BOOK V.,"Increasing much our comfort and delight,"
2000,BOOK V.,Without abating any civil right.
2001,BOOK V.,"Nay, more; producing, by thy sway, sweet bands"
2002,BOOK V.,To bind us to give Peace our hearts and hands;
2003,BOOK V.,"And thus to strike a death-blow to all war,"
2004,BOOK V.,Whose brutal spirit keeps our minds ajar.
2005,BOOK V.,Through thee our mammoth manufacturing places
2006,BOOK V.,Send forth their wares to Earth's remotest races:
2007,BOOK V.,"By which means many thousand poor are fed,"
2008,BOOK V.,And trained to Industry--by Virtue led--
2009,BOOK V.,Use right the skill with which they are endowed;
2010,BOOK V.,"Of such like men may England long be proud,"
2011,BOOK V.,"And ever foster, by good wholesome laws,"
2012,BOOK V.,Those trades which help so mightily her cause!
2013,BOOK V.,"O, may that day be distant that shall bring"
2014,BOOK V.,"Neglect of thee, from whom such good doth spring!"
2015,BOOK V.,"Hail, peaceful Commerce! still a hearty hail!"
2016,BOOK V.,As I proceed with my unvarnished tale.
2017,BOOK V.,
2018,BOOK V.,Our ship had not been long at Mersey's mouth
2019,BOOK V.,Before a breeze sprung up from east by south;
2020,BOOK V.,And then the welcome sound fell on the ear
2021,BOOK V.,"Of ""Square the main yards! Sailors, do you hear?"""
2022,BOOK V.,"A hearty ""Aye, Sir!"" was the loud response,"
2023,BOOK V.,And she had glided into sea at once!
2024,BOOK V.,"With haste they for the Northern passage make,"
2025,BOOK V.,But that good breeze did them too soon forsake.
2026,BOOK V.,"Awhile they lay becalmed, and then return,"
2027,BOOK V.,And reach the Southern passage just at morn.
2028,BOOK V.,"Soon, soon they lose the truly precious sight"
2029,BOOK V.,"Of English shores, bathed in the morning light!"
2030,BOOK V.,"A few more hours, and land has disappeared;"
2031,BOOK V.,They see no more Old Albion's cliffs upreared.
2032,BOOK V.,"Let us suppose that then this poor young man,"
2033,BOOK V.,In plaintive strains his Farewell thus began:
2034,BOOK V.,
2035,BOOK V.,"""Adieu, my native Land! a long Adieu!"
2036,BOOK V.,"Years, years must pass before again I view"
2037,BOOK V.,"Thy much-loved shores, fast fading from my sight,"
2038,BOOK V.,Or scenes preserved in fondest memory bright!
2039,BOOK V.,"Should I be spared to reach yon distant coast,"
2040,BOOK V.,Remembrances of thee will not be lost.
2041,BOOK V.,"Should I be prospered in Canadian woods,"
2042,BOOK V.,"With a sufficiency of this world's goods,"
2043,BOOK V.,"I still with pleasure will look back to thee,"
2044,BOOK V.,And hail thy tokens of prosperity!
2045,BOOK V.,"Will still remember, with a joyful heart,"
2046,BOOK V.,Each much-loved face--each interesting part.
2047,BOOK V.,"O, may thy peaceful Arts still flourish round,"
2048,BOOK V.,And happiness in every nook be found!
2049,BOOK V.,May thy great Rulers feel an interest still
2050,BOOK V.,In all thy weal--and duty thus fulfil!
2051,BOOK V.,"Adieu, my Country! may'st thou ever be"
2052,BOOK V.,"A Friend to Truth, and Mistress of the Sea!"""
2053,BOOK V.,
2054,BOOK V.,"Now on the dark blue Ocean's bosom cast,"
2055,BOOK V.,"Naught but the sea and sky are seen, at last,"
2056,BOOK V.,"Save finny tribes, which, sporting in the deep,"
2057,BOOK V.,Seem swiftly past the noble ship to sweep;
2058,BOOK V.,"Or flights of birds returning from abroad,"
2059,BOOK V.,"By instinct led, to charm each English wood."
2060,BOOK V.,"With sails well filled, the vessel plows her way"
2061,BOOK V.,"In gallant trim, nor heeds the dashing spray."
2062,BOOK V.,Yet WILLIAM'S time ne'er seemed to hang on hand;
2063,BOOK V.,"His days flew swiftly by, on sea or land."
2064,BOOK V.,
2065,BOOK V.,Sometimes a book his close attention craves--
2066,BOOK V.,"At times, for hours, he watches the dark waves,"
2067,BOOK V.,"Or sits and gazes on that liquid blue,"
2068,BOOK V.,And calls up phantoms of strange shape and hue;
2069,BOOK V.,"Or tries to realize a shipwreck scene,"
2070,BOOK V.,Till he scarce knows but he through one has been;
2071,BOOK V.,"Or, having found a worthy Christian friend,"
2072,BOOK V.,In sweetest converse many hours would spend.
2073,BOOK V.,One storm they had--it was the only one--
2074,BOOK V.,"Which lasted but a day, and then was gone."
2075,BOOK V.,He oft had longed most eagerly to see
2076,BOOK V.,The foaming billows in their majesty;
2077,BOOK V.,"And now they came, with desperate fury fraught,"
2078,BOOK V.,As if they set all human skill at naught!
2079,BOOK V.,"Strong and more strongly blows the mighty wind,"
2080,BOOK V.,Till the tall masts like merest saplings bend!
2081,BOOK V.,"Anon, the vessel ships a weighty sea,"
2082,BOOK V.,Then all below is dread and misery;
2083,BOOK V.,"While the salt water pours in torrents down,"
2084,BOOK V.,As if inclined the Emigrants to drown!
2085,BOOK V.,"Some women shriek, and children cry aloud,"
2086,BOOK V.,"While men toward the hatchways quickly crowd,"
2087,BOOK V.,"Not now inclined to utter oaths profane,"
2088,BOOK V.,Or break a jest a meed of praise to gain.
2089,BOOK V.,"Some, on their knees, implore the ""Virgin's"" aid;"
2090,BOOK V.,And some true prayer is to the Savior made.
2091,BOOK V.,"The wind abates, but still the surges roar,"
2092,BOOK V.,"Hearts fearful beat, and consciences feel sore."
2093,BOOK V.,"Ere long, the calm begins to be perceived"
2094,BOOK V.,And many feel as speedily relieved!
2095,BOOK V.,"Some hasten to the deck to look abroad,"
2096,BOOK V.,But few are found returning thanks to God!
2097,BOOK V.,"Yet some there were who truly grateful felt,"
2098,BOOK V.,And spake God's praise as they before Him knelt.
2099,BOOK V.,"Then WILLIAM saw, more clearly than before,"
2100,BOOK V.,His wondrous wisdom and His mighty power!
2101,BOOK V.,"He felt God's goodness in both storm and calm,"
2102,BOOK V.,And sense of this was to his soul like balm.
2103,BOOK V.,
2104,BOOK V.,"Now they approach the Banks of Newfoundland,"
2105,BOOK V.,And densest fog prevails on every hand.
2106,BOOK V.,"More danger does beset them than before,"
2107,BOOK V.,For they might be by larger ships run o'er.
2108,BOOK V.,"Strict watch is kept, and lights hung out with care,"
2109,BOOK V.,That they may not be taken unaware.
2110,BOOK V.,Small sail is carried till the sky be clear;
2111,BOOK V.,"Yet onward, in their proper course, they steer."
2112,BOOK V.,Icebergs are seen; and now the welcome cry
2113,BOOK V.,"Of ""Land O's"" heard from off the top-mast high!"
2114,BOOK V.,"All eyes are strained to catch the joyful sight,"
2115,BOOK V.,And Newfoundland is hailed with true delight!
2116,BOOK V.,Now soon a smart-built ship is near at hand--
2117,BOOK V.,A splendid craft! just come from Yankee land.
2118,BOOK V.,"How gracefully she bounces o'er the wave,"
2119,BOOK V.,Which seems desirous her fair form to have!
2120,BOOK V.,"A speaking distance very soon she gains,"
2121,BOOK V.,"And ""Ship-a-hoy!"" is heard in loudest strains."
2122,BOOK V.,"Salute thus courteous is by each addressed,"
2123,BOOK V.,And questions put--in seaman's phrase expressed.
2124,BOOK V.,"This done, away the gallant ship has sped,"
2125,BOOK V.,Like some fair phantom which we do not dread!
2126,BOOK V.,
2127,BOOK V.,"Saint Lawrence Gulf they very swiftly cross,"
2128,BOOK V.,And reach the River without harm or loss;
2129,BOOK V.,"Then enter south of Anticosti's Isle,"
2130,BOOK V.,While each glad face is beaming with a smile.
2131,BOOK V.,COOPER had read of this majestic stream;
2132,BOOK V.,Of half its beauties he could never dream!
2133,BOOK V.,"A pilot taken, blest with proper breeze,"
2134,BOOK V.,They soon are carried past fine groves of trees.
2135,BOOK V.,"Sweet islands spring, like fairy scenes, to view,"
2136,BOOK V.,And each fresh turn presents them something new.
2137,BOOK V.,"The pure green water tempts their thirsty souls,"
2138,BOOK V.,As forward in its course the river rolls!
2139,BOOK V.,"Neat, painted houses on each hand are seen,"
2140,BOOK V.,"And tin-clad spires say, ""Here Religion's been!"""
2141,BOOK V.,The Emigrants conceived that Nature wore
2142,BOOK V.,A lovelier green upon Canadian shore
2143,BOOK V.,Than they had ever seen in Spring before!
2144,BOOK V.,"But this was all delusion, and the effect"
2145,BOOK V.,"Of shipboard life, which they did not suspect."
2146,BOOK V.,"Now they soon mark a ledge of rugged rock,"
2147,BOOK V.,Stretching near half across the river deep--
2148,BOOK V.,"Fit place to give unwary ships a shock,"
2149,BOOK V.,And cause their crews in sad despair to weep.
2150,BOOK V.,Quite high and dry upon that rude Rock's crest
2151,BOOK V.,A ship they spy; a total wreck it seems!
2152,BOOK V.,"This vessel had old Ocean's billows pressed,"
2153,BOOK V.,And neared the Port--oft seen in sailor's dreams.
2154,BOOK V.,How came it there? Had they no Pilot ta'en?
2155,BOOK V.,Was he unskillful? No one could explain!
2156,BOOK V.,Then felt the Emigrants most truly glad
2157,BOOK V.,That they a safe and pleasant voyage had.
2158,BOOK V.,"At last they reach that well-known place, Gros Isle,"
2159,BOOK V.,And are obliged to anchor for a while.
2160,BOOK V.,"For ""Quarantine inspection"" they prepare;"
2161,BOOK V.,"The berths are cleansed, and decks are scrubbed with care."
2162,BOOK V.,And human beings who had lost all traces
2163,BOOK V.,"Of cleanliness, were made to scrub their faces!"
2164,BOOK V.,"This done; they muster in clean garments dressed,"
2165,BOOK V.,"To meet the Doctor, at the Mate's behest."
2166,BOOK V.,No serious sickness to his eye appeared;
2167,BOOK V.,Yet some for want of decency are jeered.
2168,BOOK V.,Permission to proceed they then obtain;
2169,BOOK V.,"The _He-ho-heave!'s_ sung out in jovial strain,"
2170,BOOK V.,And rests the anchor in its place again.
2171,BOOK V.,
2172,BOOK V.,"Ere this, some strange maneuvers on high land"
2173,BOOK V.,"Gain our friends' notice, and they gazing stand."
2174,BOOK V.,"Some men, at mast-like pole, to work are seen"
2175,BOOK V.,"With different balls, and what can it all mean?"
2176,BOOK V.,"WILLIAM inquires, and learns with much surprise,"
2177,BOOK V.,In this way they send news and get replies!
2178,BOOK V.,That now they're _telegraphing_ to Quebec--
2179,BOOK V.,"The fine old city, seen just like a speck--"
2180,BOOK V.,"Of their good ship's arrival, safe and sound--"
2181,BOOK V.,Her name--the people's number in her found.
2182,BOOK V.,Men dreamt not then how soon it would transpire
2183,BOOK V.,"That news, by lightning, could be sent through wire!"
2184,BOOK V.,"The fame of this, O Morse! to thee belongs,"
2185,BOOK V.,And thy great name does honor to my songs.
2186,BOOK V.,"Long may'st thou live, and reap the just reward"
2187,BOOK V.,"Of thy great labor, in good men's regard!"
2188,BOOK V.,
2189,BOOK V.,"They reach Quebec, and anchor in due time"
2190,BOOK V.,Before its heights--so towering and sublime!
2191,BOOK V.,What views now meet their truly raptured sight--
2192,BOOK V.,All Nature's smiling in the evening light!
2193,BOOK V.,"The falls of Montmorency, just below--"
2194,BOOK V.,"With all her foam, most like to driven snow,"
2195,BOOK V.,And ever-rising mist--proclaim aloud
2196,BOOK V.,The Being and the Presence of her God!
2197,BOOK V.,
2198,BOOK V.,What glorious Craft is that which now appears
2199,BOOK V.,"With graceful movement, as the ship she nears?"
2200,BOOK V.,"_""Canadian Eagle""_ steamship she is called;"
2201,BOOK V.,Like that great bird she seemed both proud and bald!
2202,BOOK V.,"The Emigrants behold her with surprise,"
2203,BOOK V.,Quite sure such splendid sight ne'er met their eyes.
2204,BOOK V.,Ere long our eager friends are made to know
2205,BOOK V.,That to the steamer they will have to go.
2206,BOOK V.,"This pleases them, for the have prisoners been"
2207,BOOK V.,"For six long weeks, and want a change of scene."
2208,BOOK V.,
2209,BOOK V.,"The sailors now are heard to swear and scold,"
2210,BOOK V.,As each one's luggage is drawn from the hold;
2211,BOOK V.,"The bustle great makes passengers look round,"
2212,BOOK V.,Lest aught belonging them be missing found.
2213,BOOK V.,"Our WILLIAM soon had need enough of this,"
2214,BOOK V.,"As he their best large box just chanced to miss,"
2215,BOOK V.,"And to the sailors spoke, who quick replied"
2216,BOOK V.,They had just sent it o'er the vessel's side.
2217,BOOK V.,"To this their statement he denial gave,"
2218,BOOK V.,Which made the men with strongest anger rave.
2219,BOOK V.,"He then, most speedily, went down below,"
2220,BOOK V.,"And found the box quite safe enough, I trow!"
2221,BOOK V.,"He dragged it forth before their very eyes,"
2222,BOOK V.,And they thought best to feign complete surprise.
2223,BOOK V.,"The box secured, they bid the ship Adieu,"
2224,BOOK V.,Then with great joy their journey soon renew.
2225,BOOK V.,"By that conveyance they reach Montreal,"
2226,BOOK V.,"Leave that by barges which had comfort small,"
2227,BOOK V.,"And take the Ottawa, whose waters dark"
2228,BOOK V.,In pure St. Lawrence leave their dingy mark.
2229,BOOK V.,"Up this dark river, and canal Rideau,"
2230,BOOK V.,"They journey on, with speed at best but slow;"
2231,BOOK V.,"Sometimes through swamps, of dread mosquitoes full;"
2232,BOOK V.,"Now towed by Steamers, now by horses dull;"
2233,BOOK V.,"In this way come to Kingston, on the Lake--"
2234,BOOK V.,The great Ontario--and a Steamer take.
2235,BOOK V.,"Upon their journey quickly they proceed,"
2236,BOOK V.,"With much more comfort, and far greater speed."
2237,BOOK V.,"Safely and soon they reach their destined place,"
2238,BOOK V.,To meet with friends and friendship's warm embrace.
2239,BOOK V.,"Thankful to God for journeying mercies granted,"
2240,BOOK V.,They settle in a Village newly planted.
2241,BOOK V.,
2242,BOOK V.,The friends they met with their warm love displayed
2243,BOOK V.,"By good advice and necessary aid,"
2244,BOOK V.,"In trying to procure for them a farm,"
2245,BOOK V.,"Where they might live, and have some comforts warm."
2246,BOOK V.,"These with our friends were joined in Church connection,"
2247,BOOK V.,And none were backward to evince affection.
2248,BOOK V.,"Young COOPER soon was pleased, as man could be,"
2249,BOOK V.,"That three of them, whom we shall name as ""C----,"""
2250,BOOK V.,"Would leave their homes and business cares awhile,"
2251,BOOK V.,"To trudge with him, on foot, for many a mile,"
2252,BOOK V.,"Through Summer's heat, and with most kind intention,"
2253,BOOK V.,For purposes of which I have made mention.
2254,BOOK V.,"He at such times would gaze upon the trees,"
2255,BOOK V.,"Whose lofty heads were bowing to the breeze,"
2256,BOOK V.,Till he could fancy them a band devout
2257,BOOK V.,"Engaged in worship, beyond any doubt."
2258,BOOK V.,"Now he first heard those ""soft and soul-like sounds"""
2259,BOOK V.,"From vast ""pine groves,"" which seemed to have no bounds,"
2260,BOOK V.,"Thrill his pure soul with their sweet melody,"
2261,BOOK V.,"Till it awoke his own rude minstrelsy,"
2262,BOOK V.,And made him long near by to settle down
2263,BOOK V.,In some small hut which he could call his own.
2264,BOOK V.,"This wish, in part, ere long was gratified--"
2265,BOOK V.,"The father bought a farm, to which they hied."
2266,BOOK V.,"'Twas six miles from the village, and a place"
2267,BOOK V.,Where much hard labor stared them in the face;
2268,BOOK V.,"And there they found that, having spent their money,"
2269,BOOK V.,"It would not soon yield them much ""milk and honey."""
2270,BOOK V.,"But yet it promised, from its rich, black soil,"
2271,BOOK V.,"A full reward, in time, for cash and toil."
2272,BOOK V.,"So, in good heart, without one ""if,"" or ""but,"""
2273,BOOK V.,They set to work to fix a roofless hut.
2274,BOOK V.,"This done, they placed their goods in ship-board style,"
2275,BOOK V.,With furniture dispensing for awhile.
2276,BOOK V.,"Their boxes served quite well for chairs and table,"
2277,BOOK V.,And on the floor they slept--if they were able--
2278,BOOK V.,"For dread mosquitoes, and the heat intense,"
2279,BOOK V.,Made good sound sleep be often banished thence.
2280,BOOK V.,"Yet God's kind care kept all in health and spirits,"
2281,BOOK V.,And they found Industry had still its merits.
2282,BOOK V.,"From day to day they did their axes seize,"
2283,BOOK V.,"And labor hard in cutting down fine trees,"
2284,BOOK V.,Or cleaning up a _Fallow_ 'gainst the Fall--
2285,BOOK V.,For which their skill was truly very small.
2286,BOOK V.,
2287,BOOK V.,"Ere long they purchased a young, wild ox-team,"
2288,BOOK V.,"Which had for months been wandering in the woods,"
2289,BOOK V.,"Where they did not but eat, and drink, and dream,"
2290,BOOK V.,Like lords of all in those deep solitudes.
2291,BOOK V.,"Our WILLIAM acted as the Teamster still,"
2292,BOOK V.,And did his test to train them to his will;
2293,BOOK V.,"Yet for a time they would not brook restraint,"
2294,BOOK V.,"But ran to th' woods, on dangerous frolic bent."
2295,BOOK V.,
2296,BOOK V.,"Once, while at logging, our raw teamster fell,"
2297,BOOK V.,And the _nigh_ ox trod on his foot as well;
2298,BOOK V.,"He tried to rise, but found it was in vain,"
2299,BOOK V.,And thoughts of their mad tricks shot through his brain.
2300,BOOK V.,"He gently touched them with his sapling goad,"
2301,BOOK V.,When they sprang sideways with their heavy load.
2302,BOOK V.,Quick as a lightning's flash the log they drew
2303,BOOK V.,"O'er WILLIAM'S prostrate form--O, sad to view!"
2304,BOOK V.,When--wonder great--the cattle stood quite still
2305,BOOK V.,(In strict obedience to their Maker's will)!
2306,BOOK V.,"His head was on a log, his neck was bared,"
2307,BOOK V.,As if for some dread ax-stroke quite prepared.
2308,BOOK V.,The log they drew upon his shoulder rested--
2309,BOOK V.,And thus his courage was severely tested.
2310,BOOK V.,One more slight move would surely crush his head;
2311,BOOK V.,In one short moment more he might be dead!
2312,BOOK V.,Still they move not!--Was this not Providence?
2313,BOOK V.,"Come, Sceptics, answer; here is no pretence;"
2314,BOOK V.,What I relate are only simple facts.
2315,BOOK V.,Given with that faithfulness which truth exacts.
2316,BOOK V.,"The father forward ran, in dreadful fear;"
2317,BOOK V.,"""O, WILLIAM, thou art hurt!"" fell on his ear."
2318,BOOK V.,"The log was raised, when up at once he rose,"
2319,BOOK V.,Though feeling much as if his blood was froze.
2320,BOOK V.,"To parent's kind inquiries he replied,"
2321,BOOK V.,"""I feel no hurt except a bruised side."""
2322,BOOK V.,"But faintness o'er him soon began to come,"
2323,BOOK V.,When he was glad to reach his rude log home;
2324,BOOK V.,And from that hour has ever thankful been
2325,BOOK V.,For God's deliverance--so clearly seen.
2326,BOOK V.,"A few short hours sufficed to bring him round,"
2327,BOOK V.,And he at logging speedily was found.
2328,BOOK V.,There still was something in this wild bush-life
2329,BOOK V.,To suit a mind ne'er formed for worldly strife.
2330,BOOK V.,The chopper's quick reverberating stroke--
2331,BOOK V.,"The well-trained oxen, toiling in the yoke--"
2332,BOOK V.,The distant cow-bell's ever-changing sound--
2333,BOOK V.,The new-chopped tree's deep thundering on the ground;
2334,BOOK V.,"The patter of the rain on forest leaves,"
2335,BOOK V.,"The tree-frog's pipe, which oft the ear deceives,"
2336,BOOK V.,"The blazing log-heaps, and the rude rail fence--"
2337,BOOK V.,The wild-bee's hum of gratitude intense
2338,BOOK V.,"For hoards of honey, which our woods still yield;"
2339,BOOK V.,The plenteous crops contained in each small field;
2340,BOOK V.,"The Summer evening's song of ""Whip-poor-will,"""
2341,BOOK V.,"Near, or remote, while all beside is still;"
2342,BOOK V.,The clamorous crow's most harsh discordant note;
2343,BOOK V.,"The blue jay, prone to steal--by nature taught;"
2344,BOOK V.,The beauteous woodpecker--the pigeon's flight;
2345,BOOK V.,"The snake, innoxious, gliding out of sight--"
2346,BOOK V.,"These sights and sounds brought pleasure to his mind,"
2347,BOOK V.,"Most heart-felt pleasure, leaving peace behind."
2348,BOOK V.,And though he toiled with all the eagerness
2349,BOOK V.,"Which youths Of ardent temperaments possess,"
2350,BOOK V.,"Till his poor body every night was tired,"
2351,BOOK V.,He evermore these sounds and sights admired.
2352,BOOK V.,And naught but broken health could e'er have drove
2353,BOOK V.,"Him from those woods, in which he loved to rove."
2354,BOOK V.,
2355,BOOK V.,"Meanwhile, he took the first convenient time"
2356,BOOK V.,"To get some cherry logs, in soundness prime,"
2357,BOOK V.,"From which rude bedsteads he contrived to make,"
2358,BOOK V.,That they their rest might with more comfort take.
2359,BOOK V.,"He made a table, too, and felt quite glad"
2360,BOOK V.,"That they, at last so good a table had."
2361,BOOK V.,"These things were spoken of not boastingly,"
2362,BOOK V.,But with a view to let new-comers see
2363,BOOK V.,"How, in the Bush, strange shifts and turns are made,"
2364,BOOK V.,"By those who, rightly, are of _debt_ afraid."
2365,BOOK V.,"The COOPERS, simple minded, could not brook"
2366,BOOK V.,To stand as debtors in a tradesman's book;
2367,BOOK V.,And even to this day--through eighteen years--
2368,BOOK V.,'Twould grieve them sore should they be in arrears.
2369,BOOK V.,"And I am sure it would be better far,"
2370,BOOK V.,"That families should themselves from debt debar,"
2371,BOOK V.,"Than blast their prospects, as too many do,"
2372,BOOK V.,By what they have so often cause to rue!
2373,BOOK V.,
2374,BOOK V.,"From this digression let us now return,"
2375,BOOK V.,To note what WILLIAM found with deep concern;
2376,BOOK V.,"That ""'Tis not good for Man to be alone,"""
2377,BOOK V.,"As said by God, in Wisdom's solemn tone."
2378,BOOK V.,"This now appeared to him a serious truth,"
2379,BOOK V.,Far more than it had done in days of youth.
2380,BOOK V.,"The birds still paired, and had their separate nest,"
2381,BOOK V.,From love responsive in each songster's breast;
2382,BOOK V.,"But, though he loved on Nature's face to gaze,"
2383,BOOK V.,"And mark the beauties which each day displays,"
2384,BOOK V.,"He felt a vacancy in his young breast,"
2385,BOOK V.,For he no lov'd companion then possessed.
2386,BOOK V.,Far different was it in his native land--
2387,BOOK V.,"There, such an one might always be at hand."
2388,BOOK V.,Where was he now to look? Religious views
2389,BOOK V.,Left him small space from which a mate to choose.
2390,BOOK V.,"God's word came to his aid, and then in prayer"
2391,BOOK V.,He threw himself upon his Father's care.
2392,BOOK V.,"That word declares, that ""He who had not spared"
2393,BOOK V.,"His well-beloved Son, was not prepared"
2394,BOOK V.,For once withholding from his children dear
2395,BOOK V.,"Aught which they need, while still sojourning here!"""
2396,BOOK V.,"This precious promise proved to be as balm,"
2397,BOOK V.,To keep his troubled heart at present calm;
2398,BOOK V.,"And he resolved in patience still to wait,"
2399,BOOK V.,"Till God should find for him a true ""help-mate."""
2400,BOOK V.,"This resolution formed, was kept intact,"
2401,BOOK V.,"Nor was the strength his own, for that he lacked."
2402,BOOK V.,"He, though so young, had very clearly seen"
2403,BOOK V.,"That Man, in every age, is prone to lean"
2404,BOOK V.,Upon an arm of flesh--most frail support!
2405,BOOK V.,"Which often fails us, oft makes us its sport."
2406,BOOK V.,"And yet, O strange perversity! we cling"
2407,BOOK V.,To that which never can us comfort bring.
2408,BOOK V.,He knew 'twas better to feel flesh so weak
2409,BOOK V.,As to be forced his strength from God to seek;
2410,BOOK V.,"To feel, like Paul, ""However weak we be,"

2432,BOOK VI.,
2433,BOOK VI.,"Hail, Rural Life! from whom such pleasures spring,"
2434,BOOK VI.,That I invoke my Muse thy charms to sing.
2435,BOOK VI.,"Whether I view thee in my native land,"
2436,BOOK VI.,"Where Science lends to Industry her hand,"
2437,BOOK VI.,"To make her cornfields yield a double store,"
2438,BOOK VI.,Or beautify her landscapes more and more--
2439,BOOK VI.,"Where wealth immense is very freely spent,"
2440,BOOK VI.,By those who on thy weal are still intent;
2441,BOOK VI.,"Or here, in Canada, thy face I view"
2442,BOOK VI.,"On well-cleared farms, or those which are quite new;"
2443,BOOK VI.,"However rude thy features, or despised--"
2444,BOOK VI.,"Though in Town-life, thy charms by me are prized."
2445,BOOK VI.,"A sense of these still urges me along,"
2446,BOOK VI.,As I proceed with my unlettered song;
2447,BOOK VI.,"And every line which I may write on thee,"
2448,BOOK VI.,I trust will evidence sincerity.
2449,BOOK VI.,
2450,BOOK VI.,The new-come settlers now with speed prepare
2451,BOOK VI.,To log the fallow they have cleared with care.
2452,BOOK VI.,"For Summer, with her heat intense, has fled,"
2453,BOOK VI.,And fruit-crowned Autumn has come in her stead.
2454,BOOK VI.,"The _brush_, well dried, is burnt; and all around"
2455,BOOK VI.,"Logs, black and charred, are lying on the ground."
2456,BOOK VI.,"These into heaps must every one be drawn,"
2457,BOOK VI.,By means which to all Bush-men are well known.
2458,BOOK VI.,Have they not strength or time the work to do?
2459,BOOK VI.,"They ask their neighbor's help, and oxen, too."
2460,BOOK VI.,"And fellow-feeling, sprung from their own need,"
2461,BOOK VI.,Leads these the summons to obey with speed.
2462,BOOK VI.,"Should the set day be fine, they start from home"
2463,BOOK VI.,"Without regret, and to the fallow come."
2464,BOOK VI.,
2465,BOOK VI.,"One looks so pale, he seems not fit for work;"
2466,BOOK VI.,"Has had the _Ague_, and it still doth lurk"
2467,BOOK VI.,"In his poor frame, and may again appear"
2468,BOOK VI.,A dozen times before he's closed the year!
2469,BOOK VI.,"Some others, also, wear quite sickly looks,"
2470,BOOK VI.,As though they had run deep in _Doctors_' books;
2471,BOOK VI.,"Or are reduced, by heat and toil intense,"
2472,BOOK VI.,"Till work, with them, would seem, but mere pretence."
2473,BOOK VI.,But let us not pre-judge them; they have hearts
2474,BOOK VI.,"Brave as a lion, and will act their parts."
2475,BOOK VI.,
2476,BOOK VI.,"The ""fixings"" ready, some experienced hand"
2477,BOOK VI.,"A ""Come, boys! Let's to work!"" gives as command."
2478,BOOK VI.,"This said, their strength and numbers they divide;"
2479,BOOK VI.,"""Haw, Buck!"" ""Gee, Bright!"" is heard on every side."
2480,BOOK VI.,"""Boys, bring your _handspikes_; raise this monster log"
2481,BOOK VI.,Till I can hitch the chain--_Buck!_ lazy dog!
2482,BOOK VI.,"Stand o'er, I say! What ails the stupid beast?"
2483,BOOK VI.,"Ah! now I see; you think you have a feast!"""
2484,BOOK VI.,"_Buck_ snatches at a clump of herbage near,"
2485,BOOK VI.,"And deems it is, to him, most savory cheer;"
2486,BOOK VI.,"But thwack, thwack, thwack, comes from the blue-beech goad;"
2487,BOOK VI.,He takes the strokes upon his forehead broad
2488,BOOK VI.,"With due submission; moves a little piece,"
2489,BOOK VI.,That those unwelcome blows may sooner cease.
2490,BOOK VI.,"The chain is hitched; ""_Haw_, now!"" is loudly heard,"
2491,BOOK VI.,And the half-buried log is disinterred.
2492,BOOK VI.,"""Get up! Go 'long?"" vociferously shouts"
2493,BOOK VI.,"Every ox-teamster, at these logging bouts."
2494,BOOK VI.,"The heap is reached; now list the loud ""Whoa-ay!"""
2495,BOOK VI.,"Louder and louder, till the oxen stay."
2496,BOOK VI.,"The chain's unhitched; ""Now, boys! your handspikes seize;"
2497,BOOK VI.,Lift! Altogether! Rest it on your knees;
2498,BOOK VI.,There; roll him over. Ah! 'twas nobly done!
2499,BOOK VI.,"The fire will dry his coat, as sure's a gun!"""
2500,BOOK VI.,"And thus, to lighten toil, they pass the joke,"
2501,BOOK VI.,Or stand a moment to have serious talk.
2502,BOOK VI.,"One of some accidents his neighbors tells,"
2503,BOOK VI.,Till each warm bosom with emotion swells;
2504,BOOK VI.,"How Jack Maguin was logging at a ""Bee,"""
2505,BOOK VI.,And got his right leg broke beneath the knee;
2506,BOOK VI.,"How he, through careless treatment, was laid up"
2507,BOOK VI.,"For full two months, and had scarce bite or sup."
2508,BOOK VI.,"Or how Will Sims was chopping near his house,"
2509,BOOK VI.,"And his best ox was feeding on the ""browse,"""
2510,BOOK VI.,When all at once the quivering tree descended
2511,BOOK VI.,"Upon the beast, and thus his life was ended!"
2512,BOOK VI.,Anon we notice that each smutty face
2513,BOOK VI.,"Beams with good humor, and the cause we trace"
2514,BOOK VI.,To the supply of _whisky_ just parta'en--
2515,BOOK VI.,A thing which often proves the settler's bane.
2516,BOOK VI.,
2517,BOOK VI.,"Again they work with stimulated strength,"
2518,BOOK VI.,"And, 'midst more noise, the log-heaps rise at length."
2519,BOOK VI.,The dinner hour arrives; the horn is blown
2520,BOOK VI.,To make the fact to all the loggers known.
2521,BOOK VI.,"The teams to some near pasture now are led,"
2522,BOOK VI.,Or with new hay most plentifully fed.
2523,BOOK VI.,The men make for the house with decent haste--
2524,BOOK VI.,None are inclined to let time run to waste.
2525,BOOK VI.,"But this does not prevent the laugh and jest,"
2526,BOOK VI.,At the black face by every one possessed.
2527,BOOK VI.,"To wash is needful, and refreshing, too,"
2528,BOOK VI.,So all go at it without more ado.
2529,BOOK VI.,"This task performed, which all should take delight in,"
2530,BOOK VI.,They to the feast prepared need no inviting.
2531,BOOK VI.,"Their heavy labor gives an appetite,"
2532,BOOK VI.,And they can eat with relish and delight.
2533,BOOK VI.,"But first their host, if he's a Christian man,"
2534,BOOK VI.,Gives thanks to God with all the warmth he can.
2535,BOOK VI.,Then all the workmen ample justice do
2536,BOOK VI.,To those good things so tempting to the view.
2537,BOOK VI.,"Dear Reader, have you seen a logging feast?"
2538,BOOK VI.,"No? Wait a while, and I will place at least"
2539,BOOK VI.,The chief ingredients before your eyes;
2540,BOOK VI.,Here's a huge prime _ham_; there are pumpkin pies;
2541,BOOK VI.,Mealy potatoes next our notice claim--
2542,BOOK VI.,"The bread and butter we need never name,"
2543,BOOK VI.,They must be there of course; and here's a dish
2544,BOOK VI.,"Of no mean size, well filled with splendid fish."
2545,BOOK VI.,"_That's_ boiled, fresh mutton; _those_ are nice green peas;"
2546,BOOK VI.,This huckleberry pie is sure to please!
2547,BOOK VI.,"And now I'll cease--no, three things yet remain;"
2548,BOOK VI.,"Tea, cream and sugar, might of slight complain!"
2549,BOOK VI.,"There, will this do? Or is there something more"
2550,BOOK VI.,Which you would think it right to set before
2551,BOOK VI.,Such worthy eaters? I am satisfied
2552,BOOK VI.,It can't be bettered in our Bush-land wide!
2553,BOOK VI.,"Good as it is, and hungry as they are,"
2554,BOOK VI.,They cannot from good jests themselves debar.
2555,BOOK VI.,One sees his neighbor cast a longing glance
2556,BOOK VI.,"Toward that berry pie; and, rare good chance!"
2557,BOOK VI.,"'Tis nearest _him_, he chuckles with delight,"
2558,BOOK VI.,And is about to whip it out of sight;
2559,BOOK VI.,"But Fortune, still capricious, gives the _No_;"
2560,BOOK VI.,His nearest neighbor does an interest show
2561,BOOK VI.,"In this proceeding, and the pie has snatched,"
2562,BOOK VI.,"Quite in good humor, ere the scheme's well hatched!"
2563,BOOK VI.,"The disappointed couple sympathise,"
2564,BOOK VI.,"And signal to each other, with their eyes."
2565,BOOK VI.,"The third one, quite unselfish, deems the jest"
2566,BOOK VI.,"Gone far enough, and now resolves 'tis best"
2567,BOOK VI.,"To help himself, and hand round to the rest."
2568,BOOK VI.,"Another to the fishes takes a notion,"
2569,BOOK VI.,With more of selfishness than wise precaution.
2570,BOOK VI.,"His work-mate spies this, and removes the prize"
2571,BOOK VI.,A _leetle_ further from his longing eyes.
2572,BOOK VI.,Such jokes pass free; and no great wrong is done
2573,BOOK VI.,To real good-fellowship by harmless fun.
2574,BOOK VI.,"'Tis o'er at last, when most of them partake"
2575,BOOK VI.,"The pipe delicious, for its own dear sake."
2576,BOOK VI.,"They rest and smoke, and smoke and rest again,"
2577,BOOK VI.,"Until the ""Come, boys!"" sounds in loudest strain."
2578,BOOK VI.,"Once more to work, with fresh alacrity,"
2579,BOOK VI.,"They reach the fallow, pleased as men can be."
2580,BOOK VI.,"The teamsters call their cattle, not far strayed,"
2581,BOOK VI.,But chewing cud beneath some green tree's shade.
2582,BOOK VI.,"_""Co' Buck! Co' Bright!""_ throughout the woods resound,"
2583,BOOK VI.,And each trained ox moves forward at the sound.
2584,BOOK VI.,"Again the work goes forward, as before."
2585,BOOK VI.,"Till nearly night-fall, when their task is o'er."
2586,BOOK VI.,
2587,BOOK VI.,"Naught now remains but scattered chips and sticks,"
2588,BOOK VI.,"Which their host's hopeful son at leisure picks,"
2589,BOOK VI.,"And lays upon the heaps--some here, some there--"
2590,BOOK VI.,"The burning to assist, which needs due care."
2591,BOOK VI.,"'Tis supper time; again the horn is heard,"
2592,BOOK VI.,And its deep tones has woodland echoes stirred.
2593,BOOK VI.,Most charming sound to my poetic ear;
2594,BOOK VI.,And every time 'tis heard still far more dear!
2595,BOOK VI.,"They hear the sound, but yet seem loath to go;"
2596,BOOK VI.,"And when they do, their steps are very slow."
2597,BOOK VI.,They are well tired; no wonder; such a day
2598,BOOK VI.,Of work laborious would some tire for aye!
2599,BOOK VI.,Once more they wash; once more they freely eat;
2600,BOOK VI.,Then light their pipes; and now each other greet
2601,BOOK VI.,"With warm ""Good night!"" but, ere they have departed,"
2602,BOOK VI.,"Their host thanks them, from gratitude warm-hearted."
2603,BOOK VI.,"Now all are gone, save two, who skulk behind,"
2604,BOOK VI.,"Of the younger son; and, if I am not blind,"
2605,BOOK VI.,"A couple of bright girls I failed to mention,"
2606,BOOK VI.,Are not quite unaware of their intention.
2607,BOOK VI.,"But this is not my business, so I'll pass"
2608,BOOK VI.,"To other things, and let each court his lass."
2609,BOOK VI.,
2610,BOOK VI.,Should next day prove a fine one with a breeze
2611,BOOK VI.,"So strong as just to move surrounding trees,"
2612,BOOK VI.,"The Settler may his new-raised log-heaps fire,"
2613,BOOK VI.,And see them burn to suit his heart's desire.
2614,BOOK VI.,"The fire is placed; _where_, think you? Not below,"
2615,BOOK VI.,"But on the top, and burns at first but slow."
2616,BOOK VI.,"See, now, the wind has blown it to a flame;"
2617,BOOK VI.,And soon the log-heap fire's no longer tame!
2618,BOOK VI.,"Dry sticks and chips, in all the openings placed,"
2619,BOOK VI.,Will prove the time spent on them was not waste.
2620,BOOK VI.,"The embers, falling, make these soon ignite;"
2621,BOOK VI.,"And now the heap, from end to end, is bright!"
2622,BOOK VI.,With pale or ruddy flame; the smoke ascends
2623,BOOK VI.,"Thick, black and curling, as its way it wends"
2624,BOOK VI.,Toward the sky. Now twenty heaps are fired
2625,BOOK VI.,And form a sight I often have admired.
2626,BOOK VI.,The heat becomes intense; for Sol's warm rays
2627,BOOK VI.,"Uniting with the wood-fire's fiercest blaze,"
2628,BOOK VI.,Make it past bearing; yet the Settler bears
2629,BOOK VI.,"The heat and toil, and smiling aspect wears,"
2630,BOOK VI.,Because the work progresses to his mind.
2631,BOOK VI.,"Let us draw nearer, then--'twill seem more kind--"
2632,BOOK VI.,And watch him with the handspike thrust the brands
2633,BOOK VI.,Closer together. He a moment stands
2634,BOOK VI.,"To wipe the perspiration from his face,"
2635,BOOK VI.,"Which streams fast forth again, and leaves its trace"
2636,BOOK VI.,In his pale looks and daily shrinking frame.
2637,BOOK VI.,"Now, every pile's a mass of glowing flame!"
2638,BOOK VI.,"The wind, increasing, whirls the fire about,"
2639,BOOK VI.,"And makes the workman, if he's wise, look out"
2640,BOOK VI.,For stacks and fences--dangerously near.
2641,BOOK VI.,He knows the risk; he deems there's cause for fear;
2642,BOOK VI.,"So keeps his eyes still wandering all around,"
2643,BOOK VI.,To mark the rising smoke where'er 'tis found.
2644,BOOK VI.,"Neglect might very soon cause damage great,"
2645,BOOK VI.,"In that which should, his labor compensate."
2646,BOOK VI.,"Hence his wise caution as the wind grows stronger,"
2647,BOOK VI.,"Until the ""burning"" needs his care no longer."
2648,BOOK VI.,"This o'er he drags the ground, and sows his grain,"
2649,BOOK VI.,And of the toil required does not complain.
2650,BOOK VI.,"He ""sows in hope;"" and, if he take due care,"
2651,BOOK VI.,A splendid crop sill soon be growing there.
2652,BOOK VI.,"In view of this, let us suppose him singing"
2653,BOOK VI.,"The LOGGER'S SONG, while peaceful thoughts are springing."
2654,BOOK VI.,
2655,BOOK VI.,
2656,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,THE LOGGER'S SONG.

2668,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Let none into carelessness fall.
2669,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Steadily, steadily, steadily, O!"

2671,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,
2672,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The logs, thickly lying, our strength seem defying;"

2678,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,
2679,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Now, lads, in your teaming, let's have no blaspheming!"
2680,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Your oxen are patient and strong;
2681,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Our logging laborious need not be uproarious,"
2682,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Nor lead us to anything wrong.

2684,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Let's act, as the huge log-heaps grow."
2685,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,
2686,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"When dinner-horn sounding, calls all that are found in"
2687,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The Fallow to come to the Feast,"
2688,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Let's guard 'gainst satiety--eat with sobriety--
2689,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,So shall our joys be increased.
2690,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Soberly, soberly, soberly, O!"
2691,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,We'll eat what our friends may bestow.
2692,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,
2693,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"When day is departing, and we are all starting"
2694,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"For Home, with its sweet earthly bliss,"

2701,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Such work as that I have described above,"
2702,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"And holding plow, kept WILLIAM on the move."
2703,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Of active turn, he worked beyond his strength--"
2704,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"And felt the sad effects, in full, at length."
2705,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Yet at this season, in Canadian woods,"
2706,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,He could not well refrain from musing moods.
2707,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Nor was it any wonder, when each day"
2708,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Added fresh charms to Nature's grand display.
2709,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The once-green leaves, struck by the early frost,"
2710,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Made up in gorgeous tints what they had lost!
2711,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,He felt that never in his life before
2712,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Had he e'er seen such hues as those trees wore.
2713,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Some that were shaded still preserved their green,"
2714,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,While others near were decked in golden sheen.
2715,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Some in deep crimson robes were gaily drest,"
2716,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Others in shades of brown, as seemed them best;"
2717,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"While not a few, of pride in dress were fuller,"
2718,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,And had their robes of every splendid color!
2719,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The weather, too, was of that balmy kind,"
2720,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,So suited to a dreamy state of mind;
2721,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,For mighty Sol felt his yet powerful rays
2722,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Subdued, being wrapped in a thin, blue haze."
2723,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"'Tis true, there came the oft-recurring thought,"
2724,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,That all these beauties were too dearly bought;
2725,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"That soon, too soon, tempestuous winds would rise,"
2726,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,And murky clouds veil those bewitching skies!
2727,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,That Winter but delayed his coming now
2728,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"To gather blackness on his cold, knit brow,"
2729,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"That he might rush with tenfold furious rage,"
2730,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"And all the elements in war engage,"
2731,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,To strip the trees of all their splendors bare
2732,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,And make sweet Nature a stern aspect wear!
2733,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Such thoughts at times filled him with melancholy,"
2734,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Which then, shook off, were looked upon as folly"
2735,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,And after-thoughts brought in their joyous train
2736,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Pleasures prospective, during Winter's reign."
2737,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,The fleecy snow's wild dancing through the air;
2738,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The clean, white sheet, wove for the soil to wear,"
2739,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,To guard the plants designed for next year's food
2740,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"From Frost's attacks, when in a vengeful mood."
2741,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The sleighing, too, in prospect, had delights"
2742,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,For one like he--so used to Fancy's flights.
2743,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"He heard already, in imagination,"
2744,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The jingling bells, producing sweet sensation."
2745,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"And 'midst such dreaming Time flew swiftly by,"
2746,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"While he, to stay its course, wished not to try."
2747,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"His Sabbath days met with observance due,"
2748,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,For he to Christian ways continued true.
2749,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The family with loving Brethren met,"
2750,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Some miles from home, as oft as they could get."
2751,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"With them ""broke bread,"" and joined in praise and prayer,"
2752,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Or heard Christ's doctrine read, or preached, with care."
2753,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"This they continued every Sabbath day,"
2754,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,And found much benefit from it always.
2755,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,
2756,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Meanwhile their worldly means grew less and less,"
2757,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,And fear of debt led them through some distress.
2758,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,At last their circumstances were made known
2759,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"To a dear friend, who did a kind heart own."
2760,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"He WILLIAM took, to help him in his store,"
2761,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,And gave good wages--which endeared him more
2762,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"To those, thus favored, who by this perceived"
2763,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"He carried out, in practice, truths believed."
2764,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"In this employment WILLIAM staid not long,"
2765,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,His sensitiveness soon made things go wrong.
2766,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"He therefore back returned into the Bush,"
2767,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Where Want stood ready his fond hopes to crush.
2768,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,
2769,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Ere this, dread Winter had set in with rigor,"
2770,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Yet he his bright axe took again with vigor.
2771,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Throughout the woods the snow lay very deep,"
2772,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,And Nature's face betokened death-like sleep.
2773,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Few sounds were heard to break the stillness round,"
2774,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Yet in those few our hero pleasure found.
2775,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The loud report of Indian hunter's gun,"
2776,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Which sometimes made the cattle homeward run;
2777,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,The beauteous woodpecker's quick rap-tapping
2778,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"At girdled trees, that long since had no sap in;"
2779,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Besides, the chopper's almost constant stroke"
2780,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Rang through pure air, and louder echoes woke;"
2781,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,While ever and anon a tree would fall
2782,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"With thundering crash, which might some minds appal."
2783,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"These all were sounds which he loved well to hear,"
2784,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"For they, 'mid hard employ, his heart did cheer."
2785,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,
2786,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Severe the Bush-man's life, and full of danger,"
2787,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"While, to most scanty fare he is no stranger."
2788,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"It needs good eyes, strong arms, and courage, too,"
2789,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,To live the life which most new settlers do.
2790,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The elder COOPER'S sight was very bad,"
2791,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Which came nigh bringing him a fate most sad.
2792,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,They were both chopping at a basswood tree--
2793,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Stroke followed after stroke most rapidly--
2794,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"When, lo! a sudden blast of wind arose,"
2795,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"WILLIAM perceived it, and withheld his blows;"
2796,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Looked up, saw danger, bade his father fly!"
2797,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Reached a safe place himself, which was near by;"
2798,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The tree came down; he quickly then returned,"
2799,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,And stood amazed as soon as he discerned
2800,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,His father's near escape from tree-crushed fate;
2801,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,He quite unconscious of his danger great.
2802,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"There rested, just a foot above his head,"
2803,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"A huge crook'd branch, that might have struck him dead,"
2804,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Had it not been for God's most watchful care,"
2805,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,So plainly manifested to him there.
2806,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"This wondrous mercy called forth gratitude,"
2807,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,And Love's warm glow fresh in their hearts renewed.
2808,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,
2809,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"In cutting logs for barn, and drawing lumber,"
2810,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Our hero spent of days a goodly number.
2811,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Amongst deep snow, and with a slow ox-team,"
2812,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,One thinks 'twould prove a damper to his dream.
2813,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Not so, however; though his food was scant,"
2814,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Of liking for the Bush he felt no want.
2815,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"He and his brother scoured the woods around,"
2816,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Where'er 'twas likely straight logs could be found.
2817,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"These cut, were left till snow had ""settled down,"""
2818,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,When to the barn-site they with speed were drawn.
2819,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Thus passed the hardest months of that hard season,"
2820,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,And Sol's increasing warmth was hailed with reason.
2821,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The more, because that Sugar-time drew near,"
2822,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"With its romantic scenes, to WILLIAM dear"
2823,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"From what he heard the older Settlers say,"
2824,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"So, for it he prepared without delay."
2825,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,
2826,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,South of their home there grew a splendid lot
2827,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Of noble maples, in a sheltered spot."
2828,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Convenient to this place, there also grew"
2829,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Some good black-ash, of which he chose a few"
2830,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"From these he made small troughs to catch the sap,"
2831,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Whene'er the time should come the trees to tap.
2832,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"A good pine tree he sought, with eager eyes,"
2833,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"To form a store-trough, of most ample size."
2834,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Obtained a _gouge_, and next his _spiles_ prepared;"
2835,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,For all the toil required he little cared.
2836,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"""Good axe-men fifty small troughs make per day;"""
2837,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"So said old Woods-men, in a boasting way."
2838,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"This roused ambition in his youthful breast,"
2839,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"And he worked hard, scarce taking time for rest."
2840,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,His pride was somewhat humbled when he found
2841,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,That he could make but _thirty_ each day round.
2842,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Yet courage took from this, that their's were made"
2843,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Of soft pine wood, which did their smartness aid."
2844,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,
2845,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"'Tis March, and now the snow has settled down"
2846,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,To half its former depth; Sol's beams have grown
2847,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Sufficiently direct to make clear days
2848,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Feel warm enough to raise the sap, which plays"
2849,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"With life-renewing power, through all the trees;"
2850,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"And yet, at night, 'tis cold enough to freeze."
2851,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,The _Sugarer_ knows no time must now be lost
2852,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,To be successful; so he takes his post
2853,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"About the centre of the ""Sugar-Bush,"""
2854,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Whence he his labors can most freely push.
2855,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"If wise, in lieu of gash he bores a hole"
2856,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"With auger, at right height, in each tree's bole;"
2857,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Drives in his gouge a-slant, inserts his spile,"
2858,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Places a trough--fast lessening thus his pile.
2859,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"At first, perhaps, the sap will scarcely flow;"
2860,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"He heeds this not, but onward still doth go,"
2861,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Till every tree that he intends to tap
2862,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Is quite prepared to yield its share of sap.
2863,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"This done, without delay he now will fix"
2864,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"His boiling place, and get two strong, forked sticks;"
2865,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"These, well secured, with pole to reach across,"
2866,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,For hanging kettles he is at no loss.
2867,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,
2868,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"By this time, if the day continue warm,"
2869,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,His work assumes a more than common charm.
2870,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The huge store-trough conveniently is placed,"
2871,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"And he, to gather sap, begins in haste."
2872,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"With pail upon each arm he moves along,"
2873,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"O'er the soft snow, the noble trees among."
2874,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"If _tunable_, perhaps a song he sings"
2875,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Of ""Auld lang syne,"" or some more serious things,"
2876,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Which tends to make his work more easy seem,"
2877,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Or drive away some foolish, waking dream."
2878,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The Bush, if large, will need another band"
2879,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,To tend the fire; and this one must command
2880,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Sufficient knowledge of the Sugaring feat
2881,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,To guard the syrup from too great a heat.
2882,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"He must mind, too, to fill the boilers up;"
2883,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"And if he choose, he may ev'n take a sup"
2884,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Of maple-honey, whose delicious flavor"
2885,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,More than repays their outlay and hard labor.
2886,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,It now has reached that point when constant watch
2887,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Must be kept o'er it, lest they spoil the batch."
2888,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"New milk, or eggs, are used to clarify"
2889,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"The saccharine juice, that it may truly vie"
2890,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"For purity, with any sugar made,"
2891,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,By those who have been brought up to the trade.
2892,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,'Tis read now for straining; and as Eve
2893,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Draws her dark curtains, we the Bush may leave,"
2894,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"And follow him who bears his precious load,"
2895,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Well pleased, but tired, to his rude log abode."
2896,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Let's enter, unperceived, that we may see"
2897,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,The Sugar take its next and last degree.
2898,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Through flannel bag the syrup now they strain,"
2899,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,And the close texture does the dregs retain.
2900,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Now it is placed o'er quite a gentle fire,"
2901,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,Till it assume that state which they require.
2902,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"This, b repeated trial, they discover;"
2903,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"When cool, it will ""grain"" well, and boiling's over."
2904,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,I've now gone through this sugar-making process
2905,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"In business form; not giving, more or less,"
2906,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"A hint of frolics which the young folks play,"
2907,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"In sugaring-time, and after close of day."
2908,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"My readers may imagine, if they choose,"
2909,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,The fun that from such gatherings ensues;
2910,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"While I proceed to frame a harmless Song,"
2911,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Expressive of the _Sugarer's_ feelings strong,"
2912,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"As he his most delightful work pursued,"
2913,THE LOGGER'S SONG.,"Midst leafless trees, in deepest solitude."

2918,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"Sol's warmth is increasing, the Frost-King is ceasing"
2919,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,His hold on the sap of the trees;
2920,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"And having wrought steady, my troughs are all ready,"
2921,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,So now I will eagerly seize
2922,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"My few rude tools, ere ardor cools,"
2923,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,Nor heed the melting snow.
2924,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,Some days of toil will never spoil
2925,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"The pleasure before me, I know."
2926,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,
2927,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"I need no inviting, to work I delight in;"
2928,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,Of such I have plenty to-day;
2929,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"The soft blush of Morning the scene is adorning,"
2930,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,Then why should I longer delay?
2931,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,The Maple tree will give to me
2932,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,Its bounty most profuse;
2933,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,One huge sweet cake I hope to make
2934,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"Each day, from the saccharine juice!"
2935,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,
2936,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,Last night's splendid freezing as truly most pleasing
2937,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,To those who the Sugar-Bush love;
2938,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"This morn's indications' need no explanations,"
2939,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,As the day will abundantly prove!
2940,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"Then haste, comrade, and bring your spade;"
2941,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"To clear away the snow,"
2942,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,That our wood-fire may soon acquire
2943,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"A beautiful, bright, ruddy glow."
2944,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,
2945,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"Now, whilst I am tapping the trees with sweet sap in,"

2948,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"By carelessness, prospects so good!"
2949,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"O, as I tap, out flows the sap"
2950,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,In a small crystal stream!
2951,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"I feel as gay, on this fine day,"
2952,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,As I have in some youthful dream!
2953,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,
2954,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"Now, comrade, each kettle of cast-iron metal"

2958,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"While I am off, guard the store-trough"

2966,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"Yet think it is quite enough, too."
2967,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,"Now eventide, and frost beside,"
2968,THE SUGAR-MAKER'S SONG.,Bid us our labor cease;

3010,BOOK VII.,"O, Memory! What art thou? Whence thy power?"
3011,BOOK VII.,Thy wonders are displayed from hour to hour
3012,BOOK VII.,Of my existence. By thy powerful aid
3013,BOOK VII.,Sweet Childhood's scenes most truthfully are made
3014,BOOK VII.,"To pass before me in such vividness,"
3015,BOOK VII.,"I stand amazed, and thy great skill confess!"
3016,BOOK VII.,"By thy assistance, things long lost to view"
3017,BOOK VII.,Spring forth surprisingly--both fresh and new.
3018,BOOK VII.,"I travel back through more than thirty years,"
3019,BOOK VII.,"With all their toils and pleasures, griefs and fears."
3020,BOOK VII.,"Go where I may, thou ever art with me,"
3021,BOOK VII.,"As Counsellor and Friend, dear Memory!"
3022,BOOK VII.,"Thy secret depths I would again explore,"
3023,BOOK VII.,And must draw largely ere my task be o'er.
3024,BOOK VII.,Be thou no _ignis fatuus_ to allure
3025,BOOK VII.,"Me from the paths of truth, nor it obscure,"
3026,BOOK VII.,"While I attempt to paint the coming scenes,"
3027,BOOK VII.,"Which COOPER passed through with such slender means,"
3028,BOOK VII.,"'Tis early Spring-time, and the opening buds"
3029,BOOK VII.,Bestud the boughs of trees through all the woods.
3030,BOOK VII.,The snow and frost remain till rather late;
3031,BOOK VII.,But Sol's great power for this will compensate.
3032,BOOK VII.,"He, aided by soft winds and copious rain,"
3033,BOOK VII.,"Will melt the snow, and break stern Winter's chain."
3034,BOOK VII.,"The Frost-King, thus so suddenly dethroned,"
3035,BOOK VII.,"May vent his rage, as if a giant groaned;"
3036,BOOK VII.,Or muster scattered forces and come back
3037,BOOK VII.,"Once and again, to the repulsed attack!"
3038,BOOK VII.,"And when he finds his efforts all in vain,"
3039,BOOK VII.,May hurl defiance on Spring's beauteous train;
3040,BOOK VII.,"And, from his region of eternal snow,"
3041,BOOK VII.,Send rude North winds to strike a deadly blow;
3042,BOOK VII.,"To nip the fairest blossoms in the bud,"
3043,BOOK VII.,"And blast, in spite, the _gardener's_ prospects good."
3044,BOOK VII.,"Yet One, Almighty, will his rage control;"
3045,BOOK VII.,"His fiat has gone forth, ""Let Seasons roll"
3046,BOOK VII.,"In quick succession, while the Earth endures!"""
3047,BOOK VII.,"And this, great benefits to us secures."
3048,BOOK VII.,
3049,BOOK VII.,The birds begin to pair; the grass to spring;
3050,BOOK VII.,And Maple sap is scarce worth gathering;
3051,BOOK VII.,"Yet, when it won't make _sugar,_ some prepare"
3052,BOOK VII.,"Syrup, and vinegar, of flavor rare."
3053,BOOK VII.,On every hand the brightly green-robed trees
3054,BOOK VII.,May hear their finery rustling in the breeze;
3055,BOOK VII.,"And pleased, like mortals, with their gay attire,"
3056,BOOK VII.,"May feel a strong, vain-glorious desire"
3057,BOOK VII.,"To have a glass in which to view their charms,"
3058,BOOK VII.,Or mark the effect of each rude blast's alarms.
3059,BOOK VII.,"Some, far more highly favored than the rest,"
3060,BOOK VII.,Have such a mirror as may suit them best.
3061,BOOK VII.,"Of these are they which grow beside a stream,"
3062,BOOK VII.,"And, all day long, of their own beautv dream;"
3063,BOOK VII.,"Or those that grace the margins of a lake,"
3064,BOOK VII.,Whose face reflects the grand display they make.
3065,BOOK VII.,"Ah, these imaginings are far from just;"
3066,BOOK VII.,Fair Nature would much rather sink to dust
3067,BOOK VII.,Than thus dishonor her great Maker's name!
3068,BOOK VII.,"And we, vain sinners, should be filled with shame,"
3069,BOOK VII.,To be so far behind in praises meet--
3070,BOOK VII.,Neglecting duty that should still be sweet.
3071,BOOK VII.,Up to this time our Emigrants contrived
3072,BOOK VII.,"To keep from debt, though they themselves deprived"
3073,BOOK VII.,"Far, far too often, of substantial food--"
3074,BOOK VII.,"Which, in the end, did them but little good."
3075,BOOK VII.,"Yet day by day they toiled with eagerness,"
3076,BOOK VII.,In hope that God would their joint efforts bless.
3077,BOOK VII.,
3078,BOOK VII.,To build a barn of logs they now prepare;
3079,BOOK VII.,"This gives them much hard labor, and some care."
3080,BOOK VII.,"To put it up they call a ""Raising Bee;"""
3081,BOOK VII.,"And, wishful to prevent ebriety,"
3082,BOOK VII.,"They buy no _whisky_; but, instead of it,"
3083,BOOK VII.,"Have cakes and coffee, which are far more fit."
3084,BOOK VII.,"The work was gone through in true Bush-man style,"
3085,BOOK VII.,"Although a few assumed a scornful smile,"
3086,BOOK VII.,"And would, no doubt, have been well satisfied"
3087,BOOK VII.,To have the _liquor-jug_ still by their side.
3088,BOOK VII.,"This job completed, Spring work next came on,"
3089,BOOK VII.,"And, truly, there was plenty to be done!"
3090,BOOK VII.,"The man from whom they bought their ""Indian lease"""
3091,BOOK VII.,"Had made _brush fences_, and there was no peace"
3092,BOOK VII.,"From ""breachy"" cattle, breaking through with ease,"
3093,BOOK VII.,To eat the crops as often as they please!
3094,BOOK VII.,"To cut down trees, and split them into rails"
3095,BOOK VII.,"For laying fence, is work which seldom fails"
3096,BOOK VII.,"The new Bush farmer, who must ever be"
3097,BOOK VII.,"Upon the move, and used to industry."
3098,BOOK VII.,"Such was their case; and. Oh! the aching limb,"
3099,BOOK VII.,"And sinking heart, as prospects grew more dim!"
3100,BOOK VII.,
3101,BOOK VII.,"Anon, the sun shoots down such powerful rays,"
3102,BOOK VII.,As seems to set the air almost a-blaze!
3103,BOOK VII.,They felt the previous Summer very hot;
3104,BOOK VII.,"But that, through Winter's cold, was quite forgot."
3105,BOOK VII.,"Besides, as yet 'twas Spring; then why this heat?"
3106,BOOK VII.,Their strength was small from lack of proper meat.
3107,BOOK VII.,"'Tis true, they did not want for daily _bread_;"
3108,BOOK VII.,But Bush-life should with stronger food be fed.
3109,BOOK VII.,"In lieu of tea, they used root _sassafras_"
3110,BOOK VII.,"So much and often, that they all, alas!"
3111,BOOK VII.,"Not only cleansed their moderate share of blood,"
3112,BOOK VII.,But thinned it far too much to do them good!
3113,BOOK VII.,"WILLIAM, especially, became so weak"
3114,BOOK VII.,"He could scarce bear to work, or e'en to speak."
3115,BOOK VII.,"When he essayed to stoop, his back seemed broke;"
3116,BOOK VII.,And courage failed beneath the heavy stroke.
3117,BOOK VII.,
3118,BOOK VII.,"The different remedies which friends advised,"
3119,BOOK VII.,All failed to bring the health he so much prized.
3120,BOOK VII.,"His fond hopes crushed, he tried to bow his head,"
3121,BOOK VII.,Submissive to the will of Him who bled
3122,BOOK VII.,"For such poor sinners, on the ""cursed tree;"""
3123,BOOK VII.,And found some comfort in his misery.
3124,BOOK VII.,One day his spirits sank extremely low--
3125,BOOK VII.,"And Faith, herself, fled from him in his woe;"
3126,BOOK VII.,"When, like a flash of lightning, to his mind"
3127,BOOK VII.,"A passage came, sent by his FATHER kind!"
3128,BOOK VII.,"""Fight the good fight of Faith,"" with magic worth"
3129,BOOK VII.,"Rang through his soul, and very soon gave birth"
3130,BOOK VII.,"To a most lively, energetic Song,"

3141,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Soldiers of Jesus! say--Where is your armor?
3142,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,The word has gone forth; you are called on to fight!
3143,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Still doth the conflict grow warmer and warmer;

3145,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3146,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Soldiers of Jesus! mind well your behavior;

3150,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3151,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Soldiers of Jesus! O, be not alarmed!"

3153,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Rouse, then, your courage! Be never disarmed!"
3154,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Your enemies seek to accomplish your fall.
3155,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3156,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Soldiers of Jesus! Immanuel's banner--
3157,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Most glorious of Ensigns--is reared up on high;
3158,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Fight ye! O, fight ye! in soldier-like manner;"
3159,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Jehovah, to help you, forever is nigh!"
3160,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3161,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Soldiers of Jesus! the foes you contend with
3162,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Are subtle, expert, they are many and great;"
3163,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Your armor's so tempered, that it will ne'er bend with"
3164,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Being used well against them; nor early, nor late."
3165,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3166,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Take Breastplate of Righteousness--take Shield of Faith!
3167,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,By which you are able to quench all the darts
3168,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Of your great Antagonist! For, so He saith"
3169,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Who styles Himself ""Faithful,"" and who strength imparts."
3170,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3171,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To these be there added ""Salvation's bright Helmet,"
3172,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"And Sword of the Spirit--the Word of your God."""
3173,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"That God who your Foes with destruction o'erwhelmeth,"
3174,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And rules both the Heavens and Earth with his nod.
3175,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3176,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Still praying ""with prayer and great supplication,"
3177,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"In the spirit of Truth, and watching thereto,"
3178,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"With all perseverence, for the edification"
3179,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Of Brethren--the Saints,"" who are Soldiers like you."
3180,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3181,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Soldiers of Jesus! now fight with all ardor
3182,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Beneath that bright Banner now high and unfurled!
3183,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"O, doubt not but Jesus will be your Rewarder,"
3184,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,When from their proud standing your foes He has hurled!
3185,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3186,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Soldiers of Jesus! your Captain is waiting
3187,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,To give you a Crown--a most glorious reward!
3188,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Forward! press forward! success contemplating;
3189,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,He'll give you the Victory; this promise regard.
3190,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3191,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Soldiers of Jesus! behold Him descending
3192,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Upon a White Throne, His bright Angels around!"

3194,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Before Him all Nations and Kindreds are found.
3195,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3196,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Hear those glad words, ""Come, ye bless'd of my Father!"
3197,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Inherit the Kingdom prepared long for you!"""
3198,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Then glory to Him and the Father together;
3199,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"With the blest Holy Spirit, to whom it is due!"
3200,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3201,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3202,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3203,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The composition of these lively verses,"
3204,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Was made to him one of his greatest mercies;
3205,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"They roused his courage by their warlike tone,"
3206,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And made him feel he was not left alone
3207,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,To fight against a host of watchful foes:
3208,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,For One was with him who felt all his woes;
3209,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Who had Himself through every trial been,"
3210,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"And still is with his people, though unseen!"
3211,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Such sweet reflections had this good effect
3212,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Upon his mind: they led him to respect,"
3213,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"More than he yet had done, pure Bible truth;"
3214,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And thus he learned to bear Christ's yoke in youth.
3215,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"His soul--so sensitive--was led, at last,"
3216,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Her every grief, her every fear to cast"
3217,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Upon her God, with simple faith--unfeigned;"
3218,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And found His promise true; she was sustained.
3219,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3220,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,His body still was weak; and on the farm
3221,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,He could not work without receiving harm.
3222,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,To be a _clerk_ he was not now inclined--
3223,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,'Twas not a life congenial to his mind;
3224,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To work at his own trade he thought was best,"
3225,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Which thought to several friends he then expressed.
3226,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,These all agreed it would be right to try
3227,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,To find employment in the Village nigh.
3228,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"In it was one who carried on the trade,"
3229,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Who, to appearance, had a fortune made."
3230,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To him he then applied, with some success,"
3231,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To get a job, and wrought with eagerness."
3232,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Alas! it only lasted for a week,"
3233,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And he was thus compelled fresh work to seek.
3234,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"That Brother, who before had stood his friend,"
3235,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Now kindly offered ample means to lend
3236,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,To start in business on his own account;
3237,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,But COOPER dreamt he never could surmount
3238,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The difficulties which beset him round,"
3239,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,So inexperienced as he should be found.
3240,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The work required, to him, was mostly new,"
3241,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"And made up by _machines_, as well he knew."
3242,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,To work with these must be his chief concern;
3243,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"But where was he to go such work to learn,"
3244,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Unless he made too great a sacrifice
3245,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Of Christian privilege? This, in his eyes,"
3246,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Was of such moment, that he rather chose"
3247,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To struggle with chill Want, and other woes,"
3248,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Until such time as God saw fit to show
3249,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,To him the path in which he ought to go.
3250,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3251,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Meanwhile, as _tinker_, he two irons took,"
3252,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"With solder, rosin, and the Christian's Book!"
3253,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Equipped in this way 'mongst his friends he went,"
3254,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And happy hours in work and trav'ling spent.
3255,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Of mending tins he had enough to do;
3256,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"And got good board, and decent wages, too."
3257,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Ere long he visited more distant farms,"
3258,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And found his calling not devoid of charms.
3259,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"On Nature's varied face he still could gaze,"
3260,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And each new scene presented fresh displays
3261,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Of God's Omnipotence and boundless love,"
3262,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Which raised his thoughts from Earth to things above.
3263,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"While, ever and anon, he found a friend"
3264,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To give him work, and press on him to spend"
3265,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The night, in comfort, 'neath his friendly roof;"
3266,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"And thus afford the most substantial proof,"
3267,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,That Human-kindness in its warmest glow
3268,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Wants but Occasion, its full worth to show!"
3269,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Sometimes a Settler viewed him with suspicion,"
3270,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And paused ere he would give the least permission
3271,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"For him to enter his small, rude, log dwelling,"
3272,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,While WILLIAM'S heart was with keen feelings swelling.
3273,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Anon, a gentle word would turn the scale--"
3274,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,The man would list the youthful tinker's tale;
3275,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Would give a hearty welcome to his house,"
3276,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And introduce him to his thrifty spouse;
3277,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Would bid her bring; that leaky _pail_, or _pan_,"
3278,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Which had been tinkered by ""that other man,"""
3279,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Who got from her the pewter spoons, and lead,"
3280,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"His supper, breakfast, and a nice clean bed;"
3281,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Then took the metal every bit away,"
3282,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Saying he got not half enough for pay!
3283,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,When WILLIAM heard such things he did not wonder
3284,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"That farmers, sometimes, looked as black as thunder"
3285,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"When he applied for work, or lodging sought"
3286,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"With earnestness, which fear of want had taught."
3287,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"All he now earned went to the family store,"
3288,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And thus he kept 'as poor as heretofore.
3289,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3290,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"About this time, an invitation came"
3291,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To their small Church, to spread Christ's glorious name."
3292,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Two Brethren were deputed each Lord's Day
3293,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To do the work, but not for worldly pay."
3294,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"They tried to carry out the Lord's command,"
3295,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Which few, in this our day, can understand:"
3296,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"""Freely ye have received--so freely give;"
3297,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"More blessed 'tis to give than to receive."""
3298,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3299,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,On one of these occasions COOPER went
3300,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"With a dear Brother, who to preach was sent."
3301,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"That Brother was ta'en sick, and could not preach;"
3302,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"WILLIAM, in public, was not wont to teach."
3303,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"But He, whose sacred name they bore, was there;"
3304,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,On Him the youth now strove to cast his care.
3305,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The school-room--such it was--was crowded quite,"
3306,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Yet he felt nothing daunted at the sight.
3307,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"'Twas well, perhaps, that every face was new"
3308,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To him, and all the future hid from view;"
3309,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"For in that very room two maidens sate,"
3310,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Both destined to be his in marriage state.
3311,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And greatly influence his future fate!
3312,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Had he known this--so sensitive was he--
3313,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"It might have him unmanned to such degree,"
3314,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,As to prevent completely the discharge
3315,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Of duties which, to him, looked very large."
3316,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"But as it was, he saw before him there"
3317,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The old and young, whose looks bespoke some care"
3318,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"For their salvation. That most precious theme,"
3319,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Of whose great worth the worldly-wise ne'er dream,"
3320,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,He with strong feelings urged upon them all;
3321,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And there were hearts responding to the call!
3322,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Such deep attention never had he seen
3323,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"In any Meeting, in his life, I ween!"
3324,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"It thrilled his very soul, and made him speak,"
3325,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"In glowing language, of the Savior meek--"
3326,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Whose love to sinners moved him to lay by
3327,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"His own great Glory, and come here to die!"
3328,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The good accomplished on that Sabbath day,"
3329,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Ten thousand fold his labor did repay.
3330,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,His unpremeditated preaching went
3331,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Home to some hearts--a Heavenly message, sent"
3332,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"By God's good Spirit, as a proof to be"
3333,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Of Grace most wondrous to Eternity!
3334,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3335,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,The simple service reached at last its close;
3336,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,When the sick Brother to some hearers goes
3337,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To learn their welfare, and his own impart,"
3338,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,With strongest tokens of a friendly heart.
3339,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Those persons were both English--man and wife--
3340,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Who knew, for years, the toils of Bush-farm life."
3341,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To them was introduced the new-made preacher,"
3342,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Just then mistaken for an older teacher.
3343,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Due explanations made, they him invite"
3344,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To call and see them, and stay over night."
3345,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"He, nothing loath, the invitation kind"
3346,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"At once accepted, with delighted mind."
3347,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The two return, and with their Brethren meet"
3348,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To join in worship--simple, pure and sweet."
3349,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3350,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,The incidents of that blest Sabbath day
3351,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Haunted his mind, till he could not delay"
3352,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"A visit to his new-made, kindly friends,"
3353,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,In hopes that it might tend to make amends
3354,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"For great privations, every day endured,"
3355,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Whilst but a mere subsistence was secured.
3356,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"He therefore took his bag and tools once more,"
3357,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,To call at places never seen before.
3358,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"He, in his wanderings, to a Village came,"
3359,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Which had, for water-power, acquired some fame;"
3360,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"There he found work that did a day employ,"
3361,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And learned what gave to him much greater joy--
3362,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"How some five miles would bring him to the farm,"
3363,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Where he might hope to meet a welcome warm.
3364,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Fatigued, he reached the house in strangest plight--"
3365,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,For sweat and dust made him a sorry sight.
3366,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,The mother was engaged in converse there
3367,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,With her first-born--a daughter blithe and fair.
3368,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,These knew him not--so different his array
3369,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,From What it was upon that Sabbath day.
3370,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"And though he gave to each a friendly greeting,"
3371,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"It might have proved a rather chilly meeting,"
3372,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Had not the youngest daughter whispered thus;
3373,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"""'Tis the young preacher come to visit us."""
3374,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"This was enough; apologies were made,"
3375,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And perfect welcome speedily displayed.
3376,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"In sweet discourse they sat a little while,"
3377,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"When _tea_ was served, in most superior style,"
3378,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Cooper of such a meal had never tasted,"
3379,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Since he from his dear native land had hasted.
3380,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"This o'er, the conversation they resume,"
3381,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,While truth's clear rays afresh their minds illume.
3382,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,This was to him a most important day;
3383,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,For gloomy clouds then broke and fled away.
3384,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"His future, once so dark, now brighter grew,"
3385,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And filled his soul with gratitude anew.
3386,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3387,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"That mother's care assigned him the ""best bed,"""
3388,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,On which to lay his weary limbs and head.
3389,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Most sweetly did the Wanderer sleep and rest,"
3390,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"As though by grief he ne'er had been oppressed,"
3391,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"He rose, refreshed, soon after break of day,"
3392,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"And thankfully his ""Orisons did pay."""
3393,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3394,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"While these dear folks the breakfast were preparing,"
3395,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,He to mend leaky _tins_ no pains was sparing.
3396,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,For what he did he would not make a charge--
3397,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,His Independence was a trait too large;
3398,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,But that kind mother would not be repaid
3399,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,In work or money for her love displayed.
3400,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,She fixed the price--a very liberal one--
3401,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And paid the _cash_ for all that he had done.
3402,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Perhaps my readers think this matron's eyes
3403,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Saw, in the tinker, a most likely prize"
3404,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To win, as husband, for her daughter fair;"
3405,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,But surely they must be mistaken there!
3406,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,This family's standing was considered good;
3407,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"WILLIAM, amongst the very poorest stood:"
3408,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"And, in his tinkering garb, was not a match"
3409,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"For that fair girl, whom many strove to catch."
3410,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Let this be as it might; he left the house
3411,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Without proposing to make her his spouse.
3412,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Yet not without the strongest inclination
3413,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,To make short intervals of separation.
3414,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3415,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Their daughter, Jane, was in her twentieth year,"
3416,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And did to him a lovely maid appeal.
3417,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"He knew her soon as skilled in house affairs,"
3418,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"But ever lacking vain, coquettish airs."
3419,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Her form was graceful, and of medium size,"
3420,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And sweet good nature beamed in her bright eyes.
3421,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Her face, for most part, wore a pleasant smile,"
3422,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,While her dear heart ne'er harbored aught of guile.
3423,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Her charms were such that COOPER'S heart, ere long,"
3424,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Could not resist their influence so strong.
3425,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Nor need we wonder much, for soon he learned"
3426,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"She had good offers, in great plenty, spurned,"
3427,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Before she knew the Tinsmith--so forlorn--
3428,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Whose poor appearance ne'er drew forth her scorn.
3429,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3430,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Phebe, the youngest girl, was quite a lass,"
3431,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Who might not yet have used a looking-glass.
3432,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Possessed of bright brown eyes and cheerful face,"
3433,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"On which, of sorrow, none could find a trace--"
3434,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Unless her paleness might be viewed as such;
3435,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Yet all who read her eyes would doubt it much.
3436,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Of lively spirits, and most active turn,"
3437,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Still fond of work, she could not fail to learn"
3438,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Such household duties as her mother thought
3439,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Best that her girls should, in their youth, be taught."
3440,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To be a favorite, Phebe scarce could fail;"
3441,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"And parents rightly named her, ""Nightingale!"""
3442,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"For, while asleep, she oft would sing at night"
3443,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Some lively tune, and always sing it right."
3444,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Between these two, in age and temperament,"
3445,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Another girl was to that couple lent.
3446,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"She, than her sisters, always seemed more shy,"
3447,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"At least, if strangers happened to be nigh."
3448,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"All three grew up good-looking, and became"
3449,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,As faithful wives as e'er were known to fame.
3450,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"One chubby babe, and three more sprightly boys,"
3451,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Ranked 'mongst the number of this family's joys.
3452,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3453,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Meanwhile a curious incident occurred,"
3454,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,To mention which may harmless mirth afford.
3455,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Our hero long had wished to take a tour
3456,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Still further North, 'mongst farmers far from poor;"
3457,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And when returning--say on _Friday night_--
3458,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To hold a _meeting_, if his friends thought right."
3459,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The place agreed upon was their ""large room""--"
3460,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"One large enough, if neighbors all should come."
3461,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"This, settled, off he went for several days,"
3462,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Toiling and sweating under Sol's strong rays.
3463,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Sometimes with Christians of most generous souls;
3464,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Anon, with those whose conduct him appals,"
3465,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Till the important day at last came round;
3466,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"When at a house, hard by, he _tinkering_ found."
3467,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The work all done, they ask him to partake"
3468,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Refreshment with them, for pure kindness' sake."
3469,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"He thankfully complied with their request,"
3470,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And found their cheer was of the very best.
3471,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The meal was served beneath a pleasant shade,"
3472,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"And he, to each good thing was welcome made."
3473,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Soon there rode by a gentleman well dressed,"
3474,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And the host's daughter thus herself expressed:
3475,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"""Most likely that's the Preacher just gone by;"
3476,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"He's dressed in black, and wears a white neck-tie."""
3477,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"""Perhaps so,"" said the father; ""'tis the night"
3478,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The Meeting's held, and they did us invite."""
3479,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"WILLIAM, meanwhile, beheld the mother's eyes"
3480,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Cast oft upon him; and, with some surprise,"
3481,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"She asked, ""Did you not preach a month ago"
3482,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"At the Plains School House?"" He replied, ""'Twas so."""
3483,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"""And is it you that's going to preach ere long"
3484,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"At our near neighbors?"" _He_ asked, ""Is it wrong?"""
3485,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"""No; only--"" There's the rub! O contrast great,"
3486,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Betwixt the well-dressed man, and _tinker_'s state!"
3487,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To do them justice, 'tis but right to add--"
3488,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"They went to hear him, and for it were glad."
3489,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3490,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Ere many weeks he is prevailed upon
3491,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To take that kind friend's offer, and has gone"
3492,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,To Buffalo for tools; and on his way
3493,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Makes for Niagara, without delay."
3494,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Years he had longed to see that splendid sight,"
3495,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And now this journey took with great delight.
3496,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"'Twas in the month of August; when, he found"
3497,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Himself for Lewiston, by steamer, bound."
3498,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,The night he reached that was a sultry one--
3499,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And such excitement he had never known.
3500,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,The room in which he tried to get some sleep
3501,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Had six poor drunkards in it! [Footnote: Fact] 'So, at peep"
3502,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Of early dawn, he rose; then washed his face;"
3503,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Paid off his bill, and strove his nerves to brace"
3504,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"By walking o'er the seen remaining miles,"
3505,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"With glowing feelings, and face clad in smiles."
3506,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"O, what a morn was that! A cooling breeze"
3507,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Blew from Ontario, and just moved the trees."
3508,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Around, no clouds obscured the bright, blue sky;"
3509,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Yet o'er the Falls a mist was rising high!
3510,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"He clomb the ""Mountain's"" rugged, stony height,"
3511,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And often turned to gaze with fond delight
3512,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Upon the scene before him. The blue Lake
3513,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"One sheet of golden splendor! Sol, awake,"
3514,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Had sent his rays athwart that inland Sea,"
3515,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Ere He rose high, in glorious majesty!"
3516,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"On either hand lay woods, and fields of grain,"
3517,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Stretched out, for miles, in one vast fertile plain."
3518,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Upon his left rose BROCK'S plain Monument;
3519,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"By ""sympathy""--false named--now sadly rent!"
3520,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The genuine fruit of murderous Civil war,"
3521,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Whose dogs--let loose--stop not at Virtue's bar;
3522,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"But oft, by their vile deeds, dare to pollute"
3523,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,What men most sacred deem as worth repute.
3524,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"May thou, my dear, my own Adopted Land!"
3525,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Ne'er hear again the tramp of hostile band;
3526,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Whether poured forth from neighboring foreign shore,"
3527,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Or fruit of thy own sons' deep thirst for gore!
3528,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"WILLIAM, arrived upon the mountain top,"
3529,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Pauses not long; he had scarce time to stop.
3530,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"He took the River bank, and there, below,"
3531,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,The wondrous rapids for the first time saw.
3532,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"His thoughts and feelings would be hard to tell,"
3533,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,While he stood there--bound as by magic spell.
3534,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Ere long he felt a very strange desire
3535,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,To brave that Water-Spirit's foaming ire!
3536,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And once or twice essay'd e'en to descend
3537,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The precipice's front, to gain his end!"
3538,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3539,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"""O for a bathe""--thought he--""in that pure stream!"
3540,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Is it reality? or do I dream?
3541,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Am I now standing on Niagara's brink?
3542,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"O that I could of its pure waters drink!"""
3543,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Soliloquizing thus, a thundering sound"
3544,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Broke on his ear, and noise of Rapids drowned!"
3545,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Aroused by this, he hurried faster on--"
3546,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The veil of mist his guide--until, anon,"
3547,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"He reached a bend, which brought before his view"
3548,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The mighty Cataract's wonders, ever new;"
3549,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Yet at such distance he could not well trace
3550,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,The varied beauties of that matchless place!
3551,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Most eagerly he took the road again;
3552,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Nor paused to seek the company of men,"
3553,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Who, reared amid these wonders, seldom feel"
3554,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The deep emotions, or the fervid zeal"
3555,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Which he then felt, as nearer still he drew,"
3556,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And found his dreams of the Great Falls all true.
3557,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"At last he stood there; and, in earnest, gazed"
3558,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,As though he could not weary: quite amazed
3559,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"At the vast grandeur of the beauteous scene,"
3560,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,And half inclined to look on all as mean
3561,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"That he had viewed before! Musing, he stood"
3562,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Still as a statue, while the mighty flood"
3563,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Dashed madly onward, as if eager still"
3564,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To take the leap, obedient to God's will!"
3565,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3566,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Again he's roused by shout, away below,"
3567,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"'Twas from a Boatman, anxious now to know"
3568,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,If he would cross to the Canadian side?
3569,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"COOPER obeyed, with Fancy for his guide;"
3570,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"And soon was bouncing o'er the heaving deep,"
3571,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,Whose current forced the boat to take a sweep;
3572,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"While, ever and anon, a dash of spray"
3573,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"Made wet his clothes, as would a rainy day."
3574,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,They reached the landing; and he now has gone
3575,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"To _Table-Rock_, and muses still alone."
3576,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,The song which follows does express in part
3577,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,"The strong, warm feelings of his raptured heart:"
3578,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,
3579,THE CHRISTIAN'S BATTLE-SONG.,

3584,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"His voice 'tis I hear, in thy earth-shaking thunders,"
3585,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"As ""Deep unto Deep"" every moment ""doth call!"""
3586,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"Waters rushing, always pushing"
3587,SONG TO NIAGARA.,Over the ledge of crumbling rocks;
3588,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"Ever leaping, never sleeping,"
3589,SONG TO NIAGARA.,Sound His praise in ceaseless shocks.
3590,SONG TO NIAGARA.,
3591,SONG TO NIAGARA.,Thy mist to my mind seems a Pillar enshrining
3592,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"His All-glorious Presence, by day and by night!"
3593,SONG TO NIAGARA.,Thy rainbows bespeak Him to Mercy inclining--
3594,SONG TO NIAGARA.,Though none who gaze on thee are clean in His sight!
3595,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"Colors blending, mist ascending;"
3596,SONG TO NIAGARA.,All are displaying His great power!
3597,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"Rapids roaring, are adoring"

3605,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"Down that giddy precipice,"
3606,SONG TO NIAGARA.,Seem deriding our vain pride in
3607,SONG TO NIAGARA.,Works which can't compare with this.
3608,SONG TO NIAGARA.,
3609,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"The trees on thy banks look like worshippers standing,"
3610,SONG TO NIAGARA.,To pay at Thy shrine their just tribute of praise;
3611,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"And loudly, indeed, are their voices demanding,"
3612,SONG TO NIAGARA.,That man unto God his sweet anthems should raise!
3613,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"Each tree growing, oft is bowing,"
3614,SONG TO NIAGARA.,Lowly its tall majestic head;
3615,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"Man, still scheming, 's seldom dreaming"

3617,SONG TO NIAGARA.,
3618,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"My soul, quite enraptured, could stay here forever,"
3619,SONG TO NIAGARA.,And drink in thy beauties with constant delight;
3620,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"But something within me is whispering, ""Never"
3621,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"Be so taken up with sublunary sight!"""
3622,SONG TO NIAGARA.,Paths of Duty should have beauty
3623,SONG TO NIAGARA.,More than what I find in thee;
3624,SONG TO NIAGARA.,For thy glories tell no stories
3625,SONG TO NIAGARA.,Of some things worth much to me.
3626,SONG TO NIAGARA.,
3627,SONG TO NIAGARA.,But yet I can gaze on thy dazzling brightness--
3628,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"Thy rainbows, thy pearls, thy clear emerald green;"
3629,SONG TO NIAGARA.,On rapids still toss'd into foam of pure whiteness;
3630,SONG TO NIAGARA.,On falls the most glorious that Earth has e'er seen!
3631,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"Strength acquiring, in admiring"
3632,SONG TO NIAGARA.,All as the matchless work of God;
3633,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"Can, with pleasure, leave such treasure,"

3636,SONG TO NIAGARA.,
3637,SONG TO NIAGARA.,
3638,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"Around the Falls he lingered till past noon,"

3640,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"So loath was he a single charm to miss,"
3641,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"He oft went down and up the precipice,"
3642,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"By means of spiral stairs which constant shook,"
3643,SONG TO NIAGARA.,As if by palsy-fit they had been struck.
3644,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"The engine's whistle warns him now to go,"
3645,SONG TO NIAGARA.,And take the cars for rising _Buffalo_.
3646,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"In that new City he arrived ere night,"
3647,SONG TO NIAGARA.,Which gave to him but very small delight.
3648,SONG TO NIAGARA.,Tools soon he found--sold only _by the set_;
3649,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"And with his funds, the price could not be met."
3650,SONG TO NIAGARA.,Here was a _fix_! Naught for him now remained
3651,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"But to return, with just his _pleasure_ gained!"
3652,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"This, as an offset, stood against the debt"
3653,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"He had incurred, and kept him from a fret."
3654,SONG TO NIAGARA.,"Once more I pause, but with a hope quite strong,"
3655,SONG TO NIAGARA.,That I may soon resume my simple song.

3678,BOOK VIII.,"Hail, Hope! thou gem-decked Maid, with features fair!"
3679,BOOK VIII.,Fairer than fabled goddesses of air.
3680,BOOK VIII.,I still regarded thee as sprung from God;
3681,BOOK VIII.,"As sent to us from his divine abode,"
3682,BOOK VIII.,"With the sweet sisters, holy Faith and Love,"
3683,BOOK VIII.,That favored mortals might your virtues prove.
3684,BOOK VIII.,"Led on by thee, we pass through heavy trial,"
3685,BOOK VIII.,"Requiring ever constant self-denial,"
3686,BOOK VIII.,"Unscathed, yet ridded of defiling dross,"
3687,BOOK VIII.,To find ourselves the better for its loss.
3688,BOOK VIII.,"Prompted by thee, we scale vast mountain heights;"
3689,BOOK VIII.,Or take to Earth's far bounds most rapid flights;
3690,BOOK VIII.,"Face dreadful storms; yea, greatest dangers brave,"
3691,BOOK VIII.,"And, unappalled, view the deep, yawning grave!"
3692,BOOK VIII.,In every age thy praise have Poets sung;
3693,BOOK VIII.,Throughout the world thy praise has loudly rung
3694,BOOK VIII.,"So much and often, that I need not dwell"
3695,BOOK VIII.,Upon thy worth: for it were hard to tell
3696,BOOK VIII.,The millionth part of good thou hast achieved;
3697,BOOK VIII.,By finite man it cannot be conceived!
3698,BOOK VIII.,"Thy sovereign virtues WILLIAM deeply felt,"
3699,BOOK VIII.,"Howe'er engaged, and wheresoe'er he dwelt."
3700,BOOK VIII.,"In constant toil, and chilled by Penury,"
3701,BOOK VIII.,He knew 'twas blessed to be cheered by thee.
3702,BOOK VIII.,"Thou madest him content in low estate,"
3703,BOOK VIII.,And for Prosperity to patient wait;
3704,BOOK VIII.,"Till some, who thought his course deserved much blame,"
3705,BOOK VIII.,Were led to full approval of the same.
3706,BOOK VIII.,
3707,BOOK VIII.,"More weeks went past, and his kind patron bought"
3708,BOOK VIII.,Both tools and stock; when he with vigor wrought
3709,BOOK VIII.,"In a small shop, and did his best to give"
3710,BOOK VIII.,"Due satisfaction, and made out to live."
3711,BOOK VIII.,
3712,BOOK VIII.,Throughout the country nothing now was heard
3713,BOOK VIII.,Save talk of Civil war; yet undeterred
3714,BOOK VIII.,"Was he, by what was going on around,"
3715,BOOK VIII.,From his employment; and kept gaining ground.
3716,BOOK VIII.,"The village of brave Soldier's was quite full,"
3717,BOOK VIII.,"And they, alone, made business far from dull."
3718,BOOK VIII.,"When he at first commended, he made a rule"
3719,BOOK VIII.,For which some folks then deemed him quite a fool
3720,BOOK VIII.,"To make good work and cheap, and have his pay"
3721,BOOK VIII.,For all he sold; and this he did always.
3722,BOOK VIII.,He had been taught to look Honesty
3723,BOOK VIII.,As the best part of Business policy;
3724,BOOK VIII.,And his experience fully proved the truth
3725,BOOK VIII.,Of that old maxim learned in early youth.
3726,BOOK VIII.,
3727,BOOK VIII.,"Meanwhile, as worldly prospects brighter grew,"
3728,BOOK VIII.,"To marriage state he turned his thoughts anew,"
3729,BOOK VIII.,And made proposals for that lovely maid;
3730,BOOK VIII.,Nor was disapprobation once displayed
3731,BOOK VIII.,"By either parent, who gave full consent,"
3732,BOOK VIII.,"As she, to marry him, was quite content."
3733,BOOK VIII.,"Though not a ""first love,"" their's remained still true,"
3734,BOOK VIII.,And smoothly ran-was ever fresh and new!
3735,BOOK VIII.,
3736,BOOK VIII.,"His humble home, and shop, were all in one,"
3737,BOOK VIII.,"And looked, to others' eyes, most woe-begone!"
3738,BOOK VIII.,It was for business truly quite unfit;
3739,BOOK VIII.,Yet customers still found their way to it.
3740,BOOK VIII.,Back from the street--up some half dozen stairs--
3741,BOOK VIII.,"Two boards, on barrels, held his shining wares!"
3742,BOOK VIII.,On one side high--the other very low--
3743,BOOK VIII.,And all unplastered; it was quite a show!
3744,BOOK VIII.,"At one end stood his bench, and close beside it"
3745,BOOK VIII.,Lay his rude couch; let not the rich deride it!
3746,BOOK VIII.,
3747,BOOK VIII.,"At times, he rose from off that humble bed"
3748,BOOK VIII.,With a fair _snow-wreath_ close about his head!
3749,BOOK VIII.,
3750,BOOK VIII.,"One bitter night, some loyal Volunteers"
3751,BOOK VIII.,"Were quartered on him; and he told his fears,"
3752,BOOK VIII.,"That much of comfort could not there be found,"
3753,BOOK VIII.,"In such a room, with all his fixtures round."
3754,BOOK VIII.,"One made reply which went to WILLIAM'S heart,"
3755,BOOK VIII.,"And proved _that man_ had ""chosen the good part""--"
3756,BOOK VIII.,"""'Tis better,"" said he, ""than our Savior had;"
3757,BOOK VIII.,"Of such a lodging He would have been glad!"""
3758,BOOK VIII.,
3759,BOOK VIII.,"Our hero, with his _hand-tools_ got along,"
3760,BOOK VIII.,"At best, but slowly; and sometimes went wrong."
3761,BOOK VIII.,It was no easy thing to ascertain
3762,BOOK VIII.,What kind of goods a ready sale would gain.
3763,BOOK VIII.,His brother Tinsmith showed no friendly spirit;
3764,BOOK VIII.,He deemed him far too low in workman-merit!
3765,BOOK VIII.,And threatened vauntingly to drive him out:
3766,BOOK VIII.,But God's rich blessing compassed him about!
3767,BOOK VIII.,"His patterns he contrived, as best he could;"
3768,BOOK VIII.,"And every month, as _tradesman_, firmer stood."
3769,BOOK VIII.,"His constant visits to his future bride,"
3770,BOOK VIII.,Much of sweet pleasure every time supplied.
3771,BOOK VIII.,Rare worth and beauty did the maid possess;
3772,BOOK VIII.,To see her was to taste of happiness!
3773,BOOK VIII.,"She was too lovely, and too gentle, far,"
3774,BOOK VIII.,For one whose mind was very oft ajar;
3775,BOOK VIII.,"So humble, that she left her father's house,"
3776,BOOK VIII.,"With all its comforts, to become his spouse."
3777,BOOK VIII.,"The home which he for that fair girl provided,"
3778,BOOK VIII.,By most young lasses would have been derided.
3779,BOOK VIII.,"'Twas just the farthest half of his rude shop,"
3780,BOOK VIII.,"Lined with planed boards on all sides, and the top;"
3781,BOOK VIII.,"Quite small in size, 'twas amply furnished,"
3782,BOOK VIII.,"With stove, three chairs, a table, box and bed!"
3783,BOOK VIII.,
3784,BOOK VIII.,"In March, his natal month, through sleet and rain,"
3785,BOOK VIII.,"He bore his wife, who did not once complain."
3786,BOOK VIII.,"No _wedding jaunt_ could their small means afford,"
3787,BOOK VIII.,Yet they had pleasure in true love's accord;'
3788,BOOK VIII.,"And what they lacked in way of outward show,"
3789,BOOK VIII.,Was quite made up by warm affection's glow.
3790,BOOK VIII.,"They were a happy couple, with warm hearts:"
3791,BOOK VIII.,Both striving eagerly to act their parts.
3792,BOOK VIII.,"If ever twain were blended into one,"
3793,BOOK VIII.,"'Twas in their case, as all who knew them own."
3794,BOOK VIII.,"He, working soon and late to rid his debt;"
3795,BOOK VIII.,She taking care of all he chanced to get.
3796,BOOK VIII.,"And, with sweet smiles upon her face,"
3797,BOOK VIII.,Dispelling of despondency each trace.
3798,BOOK VIII.,
3799,BOOK VIII.,"Too soon, the place in which their bliss begun."
3800,BOOK VIII.,Was made too hot by our Canadian sun.
3801,BOOK VIII.,"A Bakery below, Sol's rays above,"
3802,BOOK VIII.,With heat from stove made them most glad to move.
3803,BOOK VIII.,They next obtained a shop which answered well;
3804,BOOK VIII.,"For all he made, they could most freely sell."
3805,BOOK VIII.,"This place, however, they were forced to quit"
3806,BOOK VIII.,In three months after they had entered it.
3807,BOOK VIII.,"More than one person had on it a claim,"
3808,BOOK VIII.,"And each law-suit fanned their litigious flame,"
3809,BOOK VIII.,"Until at length it went to Chancery,"
3810,BOOK VIII.,And that sage Court could on this thing agree--
3811,BOOK VIII.,To have it closed forthwith! And thus our friends
3812,BOOK VIII.,"Were forced to move, once more, to gain their ends."
3813,BOOK VIII.,Each move brought double rent; but this became
3814,BOOK VIII.,A thing remembered only by its name.
3815,BOOK VIII.,"Trade still increased, as did Experience, too,"
3816,BOOK VIII.,And WILLIAM now had more than he could do.
3817,BOOK VIII.,But by this time he had assistance found
3818,BOOK VIII.,"In his wife's brother, as apprentice bound;"
3819,BOOK VIII.,"A youth most active, and good-natured, too,"
3820,BOOK VIII.,Who took delight in what he had to do.
3821,BOOK VIII.,The shop to which they went--last on the street--
3822,BOOK VIII.,"Was, as a residence, to them most sweet."
3823,BOOK VIII.,"Almost in front, a river calmly flowed;"
3824,BOOK VIII.,"Close by, a plain wood bridge the stream bestrode."
3825,BOOK VIII.,"There, he could stand at his shop door and view"
3826,BOOK VIII.,A scene which called up feelings ever new.
3827,BOOK VIII.,"Above the bridge, for nearly half a mile,"
3828,BOOK VIII.,"It is most lovely, clad in Summer's smile."
3829,BOOK VIII.,"Tall trees, of various kinds, its margins grace,"
3830,BOOK VIII.,"While it flows on, with ever gentle pace,"
3831,BOOK VIII.,Past two small islands; each one like a gem
3832,BOOK VIII.,Set in the stream so softly passing them.
3833,BOOK VIII.,"There, often has he sat, on summer's eve,"
3834,BOOK VIII.,"With his fair bride, both loath the scene to leave."
3835,BOOK VIII.,"Lit up by Luna's beams, 'twould larger seem,"
3836,BOOK VIII.,And scope afford for sweet poetic dream.
3837,BOOK VIII.,One island he would picture as the site
3838,BOOK VIII.,"Of a neat mansion, where he might, at night,"
3839,BOOK VIII.,Retire from business cares to take a boat.
3840,BOOK VIII.,And on the surface of the river float
3841,BOOK VIII.,With his most charming--his most loving wife;
3842,BOOK VIII.,Content to leave behind all worldly strife.
3843,BOOK VIII.,"Such freaks would Fancy play, when he inclined"
3844,BOOK VIII.,To let her reign sole Monarch of his mind!
3845,BOOK VIII.,"Yet, when the spell was broke, the sweets of home"
3846,BOOK VIII.,"Were such, that from them he ne'er wished to roam."
3847,BOOK VIII.,"And thus days, weeks and months most smoothly passed,"
3848,BOOK VIII.,"Till Winter came, each beauteous scene to blast."
3849,BOOK VIII.,"Now, with new hopes, alas! came fears as well,"
3850,BOOK VIII.,The strength of which it is not mine to tell.
3851,BOOK VIII.,"But those who once have fond, young husbands been,"
3852,BOOK VIII.,May well conceive what hopes and fears I mean.
3853,BOOK VIII.,"Scarce bad December sealed the Frost-King's reign,"
3854,BOOK VIII.,Ere these true hearts a Love's-pledge did obtain.
3855,BOOK VIII.,
3856,BOOK VIII.,"Protracted labor, bringing sore distress,"
3857,BOOK VIII.,Came nigh extinguishing their happiness!
3858,BOOK VIII.,This oft led WILLIAM to the Mercy Seat;
3859,BOOK VIII.,"And, oh, his visits there were truly sweet!"
3860,BOOK VIII.,"Nor was it vain; two precious lives were spared,"
3861,BOOK VIII.,"And the young parents were, afresh, prepared"
3862,BOOK VIII.,To grapple with their duties--growing large--
3863,BOOK VIII.,Conscious of weakness in their full discharge.
3864,BOOK VIII.,"The babe proved cross and fretful; and, for years,"
3865,BOOK VIII.,Frequent convulsive fits filled them with fears;
3866,BOOK VIII.,"And quite unfitted her, in after life,"
3867,BOOK VIII.,For bearing a just share of toil and strife.
3868,BOOK VIII.,"This proved an exercise for faith and prayer,"
3869,BOOK VIII.,Until the fully felt that God's kind care
3870,BOOK VIII.,Would be extended o'er their suffering child;
3871,BOOK VIII.,"And this thought made their souls more reconciled,"
3872,BOOK VIII.,"To bear with patience this great, frequent trial,"
3873,BOOK VIII.,Which called on them so much for self-denial.
3874,BOOK VIII.,
3875,BOOK VIII.,A growing interest now in Church affairs
3876,BOOK VIII.,Filled that young father's mind with weighty cares.
3877,BOOK VIII.,At this my readers need not be surprised;
3878,BOOK VIII.,Nor should my notice of it be despised.
3879,BOOK VIII.,"That Church on Scripture truth had ta'en its stand,"
3880,BOOK VIII.,And wished to bend alone to God's command--
3881,BOOK VIII.,"To copy, in their government, the plan"
3882,BOOK VIII.,"Marked out by Christ, when first His Church began."
3883,BOOK VIII.,Now they sought one well qualified to take
3884,BOOK VIII.,"The Elder's office--not for lucre's, sake,"
3885,BOOK VIII.,"Nor ""as a lord o'er God's own heritage""--"
3886,BOOK VIII.,"But one who humbly would, with warmth, engage"
3887,BOOK VIII.,"To do His bidding, and bear peaceful rule"
3888,BOOK VIII.,O'er that small Church-that it might prove a school
3889,BOOK VIII.,For Saints to grow in strict conformity
3890,BOOK VIII.,To God's just will-as they that will may see.
3891,BOOK VIII.,
3892,BOOK VIII.,"One soon they found, who had for years been tried:"
3893,BOOK VIII.,Who by Paul's test was willing to abide;
3894,BOOK VIII.,Well knowing the advice which he had given
3895,BOOK VIII.,To Ephesian Elders; and how he had striven
3896,BOOK VIII.,To labor with his hands for the support
3897,BOOK VIII.,"Of self and friends, oft made the worldling's sport."
3898,BOOK VIII.,
3899,BOOK VIII.,Let none imagine that this flock obtained
3900,BOOK VIII.,Another's labor for some selfish end;
3901,BOOK VIII.,"Large sums they raise to help the suffering poor,"
3902,BOOK VIII.,And freely give of their superfluous store
3903,BOOK VIII.,To send the Bible into heathen lands--
3904,BOOK VIII.,And that while all are laboring with their hands.
3905,BOOK VIII.,This testimony I would bear of them;
3906,BOOK VIII.,"'Tis strictly true, whoever may contemn."
3907,BOOK VIII.,
3908,BOOK VIII.,"As deacons they chose WILLIAM and another,"
3909,BOOK VIII.,Who was regarded as a worthy brother.
3910,BOOK VIII.,In God's pure sight they viewed themselves unfit
3911,BOOK VIII.,For such high office; yet accepted it
3912,BOOK VIII.,"In deference to their brethren, who made choice"
3913,BOOK VIII.,"Of them at once, without dissenting voice."
3914,BOOK VIII.,"'Twas thus it came that he had many cares,"
3915,BOOK VIII.,Beside his family's and trade's affairs.
3916,BOOK VIII.,"In preaching now he took his regular turn,"
3917,BOOK VIII.,"And, though but weakly, did with ardor burn"
3918,BOOK VIII.,"To tell poor sinners of a Savior's love,"
3919,BOOK VIII.,Or Saints instruct in lessons from Above.
3920,BOOK VIII.,"He 'midst those labors found, with sore distress,"
3921,BOOK VIII.,A constant warfare mar his happiness.
3922,BOOK VIII.,"Dyspepsia-fell disease-his stomach seized,"
3923,BOOK VIII.,"And, like a demon, would not be appeased;"
3924,BOOK VIII.,"But made his temper, far too quick and warm,"
3925,BOOK VIII.,By frequent outbursts often work him harm.
3926,BOOK VIII.,"This grieved the heart of his beloved wife,"
3927,BOOK VIII.,"And might have led to constant family strife,"
3928,BOOK VIII.,"Had not the Lord to him his folly shown,"
3929,BOOK VIII.,By greater chastisement than he had known.
3930,BOOK VIII.,
3931,BOOK VIII.,And now our friends possessed sufficient means
3932,BOOK VIII.,"To pay their debt, or purchase those machines"
3933,BOOK VIII.,Which tinsmiths use; and WILLIAM asked his friend
3934,BOOK VIII.,"If he, conveniently, could longer lend"
3935,BOOK VIII.,What they were owing him? His kind reply
3936,BOOK VIII.,Led COOPER soon the needful tools to buy.
3937,BOOK VIII.,"This was an era in their history,"
3938,BOOK VIII.,And they most gladly work more actively
3939,BOOK VIII.,"In manufacturing their humble wares,"
3940,BOOK VIII.,Or giving to old things their due repairs.
3941,BOOK VIII.,"While freely pushing their close labor through,"
3942,BOOK VIII.,They still found plenty for the two to do;
3943,BOOK VIII.,Which called on them for greater thankfulness
3944,BOOK VIII.,"To their kind God, who did their business bless."
3945,BOOK VIII.,"While thus engaged, pray tell me where's the wrong,"
3946,BOOK VIII.,"If they should sing the following ""Tinsmith's Song?"""
3947,BOOK VIII.,
3948,BOOK VIII.,
3949,TINSMITH'S SONG.,TINSMITH'S SONG.
3950,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
3951,TINSMITH'S SONG.,What though our bench labor rob us of the favor
3952,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Enjoyed by the farmer, 'midst fair Country scenes;"
3953,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"What though 'tis confining to make up tins shining,"
3954,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"There's naught in the trade which our conduct demeans,"
3955,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Then ply the shears, since it appears"
3956,TINSMITH'S SONG.,That our calling is honest and fair;
3957,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Yet take good heed, lest, in our speed,"
3958,TINSMITH'S SONG.,We should send from our hands leaky ware!
3959,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
3960,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"In using the folder we then may grow bolder,"
3961,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And form and groove pans with our consciences clear;
3962,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Drive each of the turners with skill beyond learners,"
3963,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And put in stout wire with our hearts full of cheer.
3964,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Then take a burr and make it whirr,"
3965,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"As the bottoms spin round like a ""top;"""
3966,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"And fit these tight, which is but right"
3967,TINSMITH'S SONG.,If we wish a good name for the shop.
3968,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
3969,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"In this case the setter will do the work better,"
3970,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And strong double seams will repay all our pains;
3971,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"But slight not the soldering, or customers ordering"
3972,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Their work at our hands will begrudge us our gains.
3973,TINSMITH'S SONG.,This we can do and yet push through
3974,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Quite a good share of labor each day,"
3975,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And in our sales of pans or pails
3976,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Boldly ask those who buy for our pay.
3977,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
3978,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"We thus may be working, no selfishness lurking"
3979,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Within, though the weather be cloudy or cold;"
3980,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And lawfully striving our trade still be driving
3981,TINSMITH'S SONG.,From far better motives than mere thirst for gold.
3982,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Then we may serve and never swerve
3983,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"From strict duty's plain, straightforward path,"
3984,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Our country's weal with fervid zeal
3985,TINSMITH'S SONG.,By skill which each artisan hath.
3986,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
3987,TINSMITH'S SONG.,O! then our bench labor may bring us the favor
3988,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Of a jaunt now and then midst the forests and fields,"
3989,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Which pleasure so joyous can never annoy us,"
3990,TINSMITH'S SONG.,If health and contentment it constantly yields.
3991,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Then ply the shears, since it appears"
3992,TINSMITH'S SONG.,That our calling is honest and fair;
3993,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Yet take good heed lest in our speed.
3994,TINSMITH'S SONG.,We should send from our hands leaky ware.
3995,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
3996,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
3997,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
3998,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And now these parents' hearts were rendered glad
3999,TINSMITH'S SONG.,By a sweet babe as ever parents had;
4000,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"A lovely boy, a precious first-born son,"
4001,TINSMITH'S SONG.,An April flower ere Spring had well begun.
4002,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Thus were their family and cares increased
4003,TINSMITH'S SONG.,While pleasure was not lessened in the least.
4004,TINSMITH'S SONG.,But a few months were destined to disclose
4005,TINSMITH'S SONG.,A lengthy list of what some think are woes.
4006,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Three serious accidents that year befel
4007,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"His aged father, and 'twere hard to tell"
4008,TINSMITH'S SONG.,The weary months of suffering he endured
4009,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Ere loss of limb to him relief procured.
4010,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Their patron, too, was by sore sickness brought"
4011,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Down to death's door, as all who saw him thought"
4012,TINSMITH'S SONG.,WILLIAM at last was on a sick-bed thrown
4013,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"For many weeks, and then was fully shown"
4014,TINSMITH'S SONG.,The fervent love and patience of his wife
4015,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Increasing still through years of after life.
4016,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Bereft of reason, as his friends declared,"
4017,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Rich consolation he at all times shared.
4018,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Death--man's ""last foe""--for him no terrors had,"
4019,TINSMITH'S SONG.,His blighted prospects did not make him sad.
4020,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"To leave his wife and babes he was resigned,"
4021,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And this while all deemed him of unsound mind.
4022,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"The tempter, true, his faith and feelings tried,"
4023,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"But his suggestions met ""God will provide."""
4024,TINSMITH'S SONG.,This simple text was strong enough to stay
4025,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Each wavering thought that rose from day to day.
4026,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
4027,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"The time when he fell sick was in the Fall,"
4028,TINSMITH'S SONG.,When lively business made most pressing call.
4029,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And yet he was enabled to abide
4030,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Content with this, ""Jehovah will provide,"""
4031,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Ev'n so he did, and that in wondrous way,"
4032,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"For his wife's brother worked both night and day,"
4033,TINSMITH'S SONG.,A striking instance of unselfishness
4034,TINSMITH'S SONG.,But rarely seen in youths of such a class.
4035,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
4036,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Though outward things looked dark, this chastisement"
4037,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Was plainly from a loving father sent;
4038,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And they saw constant reason to rejoice
4039,TINSMITH'S SONG.,That what is painful might be made their choice.
4040,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"For, while it weaned their thoughts from things of earth"
4041,TINSMITH'S SONG.,It made them prize the more their heavenly birth.
4042,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And ev'n their fond affection for each other
4043,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Was purified from that which tends to smother
4044,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"The noblest energies of Christian souls,"
4045,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And far too often their best thoughts controls.
4046,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"This sickness showed, and that most strikingly,"
4047,TINSMITH'S SONG.,How good a nurse this faithful wife could be.
4048,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Through all her trials she was quite resigned,"
4049,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And not one murmuring thought rose in her mind.
4050,TINSMITH'S SONG.,A more attentive or enduring nurse
4051,TINSMITH'S SONG.,I'm very sure ne'er shone in poet's verse.
4052,TINSMITH'S SONG.,When his recovery was manifested
4053,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Her love and patience were severely tested.
4054,TINSMITH'S SONG.,For _calomel_ caused him such great distress
4055,TINSMITH'S SONG.,He was oft found in fits of fretfulness.
4056,TINSMITH'S SONG.,But yet she meekly bore with his caprice
4057,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And her self-sacrifice did never cease.
4058,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
4059,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"He, when restored again to perfect health,"
4060,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Grew far more conscious of the store of wealth
4061,TINSMITH'S SONG.,By him possessed in having such a wife
4062,TINSMITH'S SONG.,To act as helpmate through the storms of life.
4063,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"And not long after, when their lovely boy"
4064,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Was very sick, he did his skill employ"
4065,TINSMITH'S SONG.,To soothe her sorrows by an artless lay
4066,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Exhorting her to make God's love her stay;
4067,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"And holding up to view Heaven's perfect bliss,"
4068,TINSMITH'S SONG.,He aimed to show that naught can come amiss
4069,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"To those who all their hopes on Jesus rest,"
4070,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"And ""seek through His Atonement to be bless'd."""
4071,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
4072,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Their child restored, their joys again increase,"
4073,TINSMITH'S SONG.,For God's sweet service yields them constant peace.
4074,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"He, constantly employed in hard bench work,"
4075,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Let not a thirst for wealth within him lurk,"
4076,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And was enabled to preserve his mind
4077,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"So free from care that, when he felt inclined,"
4078,TINSMITH'S SONG.,He could with ease bring all his thoughts to bear
4079,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"On Scripture truths, and each with each compare,"
4080,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Or let his fancy take her random flight
4081,TINSMITH'S SONG.,To bring from _Dreamland_ some new-coined delight.
4082,TINSMITH'S SONG.,At other times would raise his tuneful voice
4083,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"And sing sweet hymns which long had been his choice,"
4084,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Or else recite some charming poetry
4085,TINSMITH'S SONG.,With touch of skill and much of energy.
4086,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"At times his spouse, too, did her sewing bring,"
4087,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And joined harmoniously God's praise to sing.
4088,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Thus mostly passed their time for months and years
4089,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"In bliss too great to last, as it appears."
4090,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Meanwhile their debt most honestly was paid,"
4091,TINSMITH'S SONG.,By which then prospects were much brighter made.
4092,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Yet gratitude glowed brightly in each heart,"
4093,TINSMITH'S SONG.,To him who acted such a friendly part
4094,TINSMITH'S SONG.,As to lend money and then wait for years
4095,TINSMITH'S SONG.,In patience for the payment of arrears.
4096,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
4097,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"About this time they visited ""The Falls,"""
4098,TINSMITH'S SONG.,As business was not urgent in its calls.
4099,TINSMITH'S SONG.,WILLIAM felt joyful in no trifling measure
4100,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"With such a wife to share so great a pleasure,"
4101,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And gladly spent his money and his time
4102,TINSMITH'S SONG.,To view with her that scenery sublime.
4103,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"This jaunt gave both the most heartfelt delight,"
4104,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And furnished her the first and only sight
4105,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"She ever had of wonders there displayed,"
4106,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Which were in Spring's fresh beauty then arrayed.
4107,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"They stood and gazed, or sat in shady place,"
4108,TINSMITH'S SONG.,With glowing feelings pictured in each face.
4109,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"He greatly longed to have a dwelling near,"
4110,TINSMITH'S SONG.,That he might oftener view scenes grown so dear.
4111,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"But family needs would force themselves on him,"
4112,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And those bright visions very soon grew dim.
4113,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Yet he inquiry made of settlers round
4114,TINSMITH'S SONG.,To learn what prospects then might there be found
4115,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Of earning a just living at his trade;
4116,TINSMITH'S SONG.,But this quite threw the project in the shade.
4117,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Then he thought fit to let ""well be"" alone"
4118,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Till clearer light should on the scheme be thrown.
4119,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Hopes next arose that he might yet revisit
4120,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Once every year, with pleasure more exquisite,"
4121,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Those grand, unrivalled Falls with her he loved,"
4122,TINSMITH'S SONG.,More lovely still now that her love was proved.
4123,TINSMITH'S SONG.,The sequel shows how little we foresee
4124,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Of good or evil in our destiny.
4125,TINSMITH'S SONG.,'Tis right; and this should make us place our trust
4126,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"In God, our Father, ever wise and just."
4127,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Since naught can happen without His permission
4128,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Who orders our affairs with wise precision.
4129,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
4130,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"At the appointed time they home returned,"
4131,TINSMITH'S SONG.,While love for it more strongly in them burned.
4132,TINSMITH'S SONG.,One Winter and two Summers now had passed
4133,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Since a fine boy upon their care was cast.
4134,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Again stern winter came, with cloudy skies"
4135,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And howling blasts like some fell demon cries.
4136,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Dark, chill November had been ushered in,"
4137,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"With much of elemental strife and din,"
4138,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"When came another daughter, bright and fair,"
4139,TINSMITH'S SONG.,To charm the hearts of that still loving pair.
4140,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"The new come love pledge, as time swiftly flew,"
4141,TINSMITH'S SONG.,In sweetest bands their souls more closely drew.
4142,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Increasing means more household comforts brought,"
4143,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Not greatly coveted if they were sought.
4144,TINSMITH'S SONG.,They asked God day by day for such supplies
4145,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Of worldly blessings as He deemed most wise,"
4146,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Took those most thankfully He kindly sent,"
4147,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"And with their lot, for most part, were content."
4148,TINSMITH'S SONG.,'Tis true that COOPER wished to spend more time
4149,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"For the improvement of himself in rhyme,"
4150,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"But greater duties had a higher claim,"
4151,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Neglect of which would bring upon him blame.
4152,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"He therefore kept his muse in close subjection,"
4153,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And gained God's blessing and most kind protection.
4154,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Yet now and then his pent up feelings broke
4155,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Through all restraint, and his rude harp awoke"
4156,TINSMITH'S SONG.,To pour forth numbers with intent to cheer
4157,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Parents or friends, who lent a willing ear"
4158,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"To his effusions, void of learning's grace,"
4159,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"But full of feeling, which supplied its place."
4160,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
4161,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Another Spring and Summer passed away,"
4162,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Then Autumn, too, and Winter held the sway;"
4163,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"While January, when half its course was run,"
4164,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Brought to our friends a second infant son.
4165,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Two of each kind parental love now claim,"
4166,TINSMITH'S SONG.,As sharers of their destiny and name;
4167,TINSMITH'S SONG.,While years of happiness might seem in store
4168,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"For, prosperous still, they loved each other more."
4169,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"That season was their best in way of trade,"
4170,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And thus their prospects wore no darkening shade.
4171,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
4172,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Satan--arch enemy of all mankind--
4173,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Beheld with envy their true peace of mind,"
4174,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And most maliciously employed his skill
4175,TINSMITH'S SONG.,To work them woe--defiant of God's will.
4176,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Their worldly property he did not touch,"
4177,TINSMITH'S SONG.,For loss of this would not be felt so much
4178,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"As trouble with their brethren in the church,"
4179,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Severed from whom they might be left in lurch.
4180,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"His plan succeeded, as I know too well,"
4181,TINSMITH'S SONG.,For some deemed wise were held as by a spell
4182,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"In hands of strongest preconceived opinion,"
4183,TINSMITH'S SONG.,While Ignorance held them in his dominion.
4184,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"WILLIAM had seen this long, and mourned in soul,"
4185,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"With such emotion as scarce brooked control,"
4186,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"And, knowing that they held it just and right"
4187,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"For all to seek increasing Scripture light,"
4188,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"He, in the search for truth, gave up his mind,"
4189,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And was well pleased some few choice pearls to find.
4190,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"These lustrous gems he had no wish to hide,"
4191,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"So held them up to view, and earnest tried"
4192,TINSMITH'S SONG.,To lead his brethren to approve their worth;
4193,TINSMITH'S SONG.,But such a course gave to contention birth.
4194,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Nor was it long before occasion came
4195,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"For those opposed to lay upon him blame,"
4196,TINSMITH'S SONG.,The end of which was that they did him sever
4197,TINSMITH'S SONG.,From sweet communion with their church forever!
4198,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Under this blow he tried to bear up well,"
4199,TINSMITH'S SONG.,But all he suffered 'twould be hard to tell.
4200,TINSMITH'S SONG.,His spouse and parents with him sympathised
4201,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And broke the bands which each so long had prized.
4202,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Naught now remained for them but to unite
4203,TINSMITH'S SONG.,In holy fellowship with purer light.
4204,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Soon some few other friends who knew their case
4205,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Their humble cause did with much warmth embrace.
4206,TINSMITH'S SONG.,One with our hero labored in the Word
4207,TINSMITH'S SONG.,With what small skill and time he could afford.
4208,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Things went on smoothly for about a year,"
4209,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And some success did much their hearts to cheer.
4210,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Ere long, however, troubles unforeseen"
4211,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Burst on the little band with shafts so keen
4212,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"That WILLIAM'S faith and strength were sorely tried,"
4213,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And with his lot he was dissatisfied.
4214,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"One of the flock was easily led astray,"
4215,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And self-indulgence held him in its sway.
4216,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Two others left because a change of view
4217,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Made several seek to be baptized anew.
4218,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
4219,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Slow passed another very trying year,"
4220,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"And thick gloom gathered, filling them with fear."
4221,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Our friend was sick from an unquiet mind,"
4222,TINSMITH'S SONG.,While Comfort--wonted guest--he failed to find.
4223,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"At last his loved, his idolized wife"
4224,TINSMITH'S SONG.,In her accouchment left this mortal life.
4225,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"Schooled long, he firmly bore this heavy stroke,"
4226,TINSMITH'S SONG.,And bowed his head submissive 'neath God's yoke.
4227,TINSMITH'S SONG.,"This brought him peace, and his sad muse ere long"
4228,TINSMITH'S SONG.,Found utterance in the following mournful song:
4229,TINSMITH'S SONG.,
4230,TINSMITH'S SONG.,

4245,WILLIAM'S LAMENT ON THE DEATH OF HIS BELOVED WIFE.,Thou wast not then so foolish as to deem
4246,WILLIAM'S LAMENT ON THE DEATH OF HIS BELOVED WIFE.,An early death a vain or idle dream.
4247,WILLIAM'S LAMENT ON THE DEATH OF HIS BELOVED WIFE.,"We oft had converse on that mournful theme,"

4253,WILLIAM'S LAMENT ON THE DEATH OF HIS BELOVED WIFE.,And oft together led to seek God's ways.
4254,WILLIAM'S LAMENT ON THE DEATH OF HIS BELOVED WIFE.,"Most unfeigned pleasure did we take in this,"
4255,WILLIAM'S LAMENT ON THE DEATH OF HIS BELOVED WIFE.,And gained as fruit sweet tastes of heavenly bliss.

4302,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,[Footnote: For the benefit of such readers as are not acquainted with
4303,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"the locality of Lake Windermere, I may say it is the largest lake in"
4304,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"England, and lies to the north.]"
4305,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4306,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Near the side of Windermere,"
4307,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Down a gentle rising hill,"
4308,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Flowed a murmuring brook so clear
4309,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Every portion of the year,"
4310,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,And no doubt is flowing still.
4311,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4312,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Hard by stood a small, neat house,"
4313,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Tenanted by peasants poor.
4314,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"The mother was a loving spouse,"
4315,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"One who never was a blowze,"
4316,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,But most tidy evermore.
4317,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4318,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,The husband was an honest man
4319,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Working hard on working days,"
4320,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Deeming it the wisest plan.
4321,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Each day's labor he began
4322,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,By pure prayer to God always.
4323,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4324,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,We shall call them HUMBLEWORTH;
4325,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,They such name deserved quite well.
4326,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,In that country of the north
4327,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"All would speak their praises forth,"
4328,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,With delight their worth would tell.
4329,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4330,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Three dear children graced their home,"
4331,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Lovely were they in their youth.
4332,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"When they chanced in woods to roam,"
4333,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Fairies seemed they to become;
4334,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Full their hearts of love and truth.
4335,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4336,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"AMIE, BESS and little ANN"
4337,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,We their names at present call;
4338,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,AMIE'S bloom was richer than
4339,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Any rose which zephyrs fan.
4340,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"She had, too, a lovely soul."
4341,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4342,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"BESS was as a lily pale,"
4343,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Graceful as a fawn could be.
4344,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"She was never very hale,"
4345,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Parents' eyes could see her fail,"
4346,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,And they felt anxiety.
4347,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4348,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Little ANN, a chubby lass,"
4349,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Was the youngest and the pet;
4350,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Friends all thought naught could surpass
4351,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,That sweet child in loveliness
4352,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Which they in their lives had met.
4353,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4354,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,I have said that they were poor.
4355,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,This was true of worldly things;
4356,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Yet they had an ample store,"
4357,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,They were skilled in Bible lore;
4358,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,And from this sweet comfort springs.
4359,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4360,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Very close observers might
4361,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Deem them once of higher rank,"
4362,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"They defrauded of their right,"
4363,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"But still blest with gospel light,"
4364,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Of rich consolation drank.
4365,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4366,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4367,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Near them lived a proud, rich man,"
4368,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Wide his lands, but small his heart."
4369,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Of him a report there ran
4370,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,That he to be rich began
4371,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Practicing a knavish part.
4372,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4373,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"""GRIPEY"" was the name he bore"
4374,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,'Mongst the country people round;
4375,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,They could reckon up a score
4376,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Of vile actions, if not more,"
4377,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,And from these this name they found.
4378,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4379,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Call I him ""SIR FINGERNEED,"""
4380,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Such a name is more genteel;
4381,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Had he done one worthy deed
4382,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,I would not withold the meed
4383,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Of sweet praise I truly feel.
4384,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4385,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"He had but an only son,"
4386,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,WILLIAM was his given name;
4387,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"He to love had not begun,"
4388,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Yet at times he liked to run
4389,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,In the woods when AMIE came.
4390,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4391,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,There for her he'd try to find
4392,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Hazel nuts and berries, too."
4393,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Thus he showed his heart was kind--
4394,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,That he had no churlish mind
4395,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,When such actions he could do.
4396,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4397,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4398,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4399,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Time flew past; poor BESSIE lay--
4400,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,On her humble dying bed.
4401,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Parents now beside her pray,"
4402,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,AMIE watches her by day--
4403,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Moving round with softest tread.
4404,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4405,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,WILLIAM oft some dainty brought
4406,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"To her by his mother sent,"
4407,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"And returned with sober thought,"
4408,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Musing as each mortal ought
4409,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,On a death-bed scene intent.
4410,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4411,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,He had heard fair AMIE speak
4412,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Of a place above the sky,"
4413,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Where dear BESS with spirit meek
4414,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Would be taken, though so weak,"
4415,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,If at present she should die.
4416,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4417,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Now he reaches that fine place
4418,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Where he and his parents live.
4419,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Marks of sadness on his face
4420,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Make his father wish to trace
4421,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,What could him such trouble give.
4422,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4423,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"WILLIAM, not inclined to guile,"
4424,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Did the truth at once disclose.
4425,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,This creates a scornful smile
4426,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"On that rich man's face the while,"
4427,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Then unto his wife he goes,"
4428,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4429,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,And in stern and angry mood
4430,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Asks her why she sent the boy;
4431,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Did she call that doing good
4432,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Sending one of gentler blood,"
4433,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Just to watch a cottar die?
4434,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4435,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"He no reasons deigns to hear,"
4436,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Bids the boy not go again.
4437,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,WILLIAM drops a silent tear
4438,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"While his parent still is near,"
4439,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Yet strict silence does maintain.
4440,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4441,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4442,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4443,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"BESS has left this earthly scene,"
4444,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Sorrow therefore fills that home.
4445,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"They have to the churchyard been,"
4446,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,And its clods are now between
4447,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Them and charming BESSIE'S form.
4448,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4449,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"They were not alone in grief,"
4450,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"WILLIAM sorrowed much at heart,"
4451,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Knew not yet the saint's belief,"
4452,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,And most slowly came relief
4453,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,To remove from him his smart.
4454,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4455,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Those who seek to curb the mind
4456,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Of their offspring in their youth,"
4457,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Should show reason why they bind,"
4458,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Clothed in language very kind,"
4459,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Lest they tempt them from the truth.
4460,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4461,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Soon the youth began to feel
4462,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Galled by most unjust restraint,"
4463,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,And did oft in secret steal
4464,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"To enquire of AMIE'S weal,"
4465,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,And to her would make complaint.
4466,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4467,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Then she told her father all.
4468,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Calm but firm was his reply:--
4469,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"""WILLIAM shall no longer call;"
4470,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Some great ill might him befall,"
4471,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"And he must himself deny."""
4472,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4473,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,This AMELIA saw was right
4474,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,And informed the gentle boy.
4475,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Tears bedimmed his eyes that night
4476,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"For the loss of his delight,"
4477,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Which would all his peace destroy.
4478,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4479,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Said he now, ""I will refrain"
4480,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"From my visits, AMIE dear,"
4481,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,If you'll true to me remain
4482,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Till I can consent obtain
4483,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"From my father, whom I fear."""
4484,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4485,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"AMIE blushed, her word did pledge."
4486,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,WILLIAM snatched a parting kiss
4487,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"As he swiftly climbs the hedge,"
4488,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Fairest dreams his mind engage
4489,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,For he tastes of lovers' bliss.
4490,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4491,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4492,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4493,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Pass we o'er five tedious years.
4494,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Years which saw great changes come
4495,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"To some thousands in all spheres,"
4496,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Raised by hopes or sunk by fears,"
4497,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Now alive, or in the tomb"
4498,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4499,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,WILLIAM had just come from school
4500,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Summoned to his father's bed
4501,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,On an Autumn evening cool.
4502,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Now dread thoughts began to rule
4503,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Him who lay just like the dead.
4504,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4505,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Why that start, that vacant stare?"
4506,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Does he know his son is by?
4507,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Guilty conscience who can bear?
4508,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Hope shut out or blank Despair,"
4509,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,When one's latter end is nigh?
4510,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4511,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Stood the youth with tearful eyes
4512,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Fixed upon the dying man.
4513,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"He would speak, but when he tries"
4514,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,His young soul within him dies
4515,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,As he views that face so wan.
4516,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4517,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Speaks the father now at last,"
4518,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"""WILLIAM, listen to my tale."
4519,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"I through dreadful crime have passed,"
4520,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,But while life is ebbing fast
4521,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Now to you I would unveil
4522,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4523,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"""My base heart, if yet I may"
4524,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,In some measure crime atone.
4525,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,It is thirty years this day
4526,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Since a _Will_ I made away,"
4527,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,To gain riches not my own.
4528,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4529,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"""Him I wronged is HUMBLEWORTH,"
4530,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Long a neighbor near this house:
4531,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,His my wealth by right of birth;
4532,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,All I own upon this earth
4533,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Is my family--and disgrace.
4534,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4535,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"""I would make amends to him,"
4536,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,But grim death now shakes his dart;
4537,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Breathing fails me, eyes grow dim,"
4538,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Spectres 'fore my vision skim,"
4539,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,And with terrors fill my heart.
4540,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4541,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"""List, my son, your's be the task,"
4542,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"When I'm past this earthly scene,"
4543,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Pardon for my sin to ask,"
4544,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"My vile conduct to unmask,"
4545,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,And make known what I have been.
4546,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4547,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"""But, my boy, in pity spare,"
4548,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Spare your mother's feelings dear.
4549,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Warning take, from me, nor dare"
4550,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Sport with sin; of that beware,"
4551,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,For great danger lurketh near.
4552,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4553,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"""I more would say, but now again"
4554,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Death's strong fetters bind my tongue."""
4555,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Soon his struggles are in vain;
4556,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"WILLIAM'S heart is wrung with pain,"
4557,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,And his nerves are all unstrung.
4558,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4559,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Startling groans break on his ear
4560,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Now that ill-spent life has fled.
4561,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,WILLIAM sees his mother near
4562,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"And attempts her heart to cheer,"
4563,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,As she sinks upon the bed.
4564,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4565,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Seems this stroke too hard to bear.
4566,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"In the lack of Christian hope,"
4567,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Her weak heart from grief and care
4568,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Droops too soon to dire despair;
4569,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,With such foe she cannot cope.
4570,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4571,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Now the youth feels greatest need
4572,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"To curb well his ardent grief,"
4573,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Calls he loud for help with speed.
4574,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"His commands the servants heed,"
4575,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,They obey his mandates brief.
4576,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4577,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,First the mistress they convey
4578,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,To her room and lay her down.
4579,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"There would WILLIAM with her stay,"
4580,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,But he could not brook delay
4581,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Till his father's crime he own.
4582,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4583,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Goes he to the house once more
4584,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Where his dear AMELIA lives.
4585,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"With a heart most truly sore,"
4586,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Reaches he the cottage door,"
4587,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Knocks; no one admittance gives.
4588,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4589,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Why is all so still around?
4590,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,This place they did occupy!
4591,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"""Where can HUMBLEWORTHS be found?"""
4592,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Asks he loud, nor heeds the sound"
4593,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Of man's footsteps passing by.
4594,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4595,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Turns the man in haste his head
4596,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"And the youth does recognize,"
4597,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Tells him, ""In the lake's clean bed"
4598,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Some one found poor AMIE dead!"""
4599,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,And that thitherward he hies.
4600,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4601,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"This like thrust of dagger came,"
4602,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Near depriving him of sense.
4603,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"In his breast's a raging flame,"
4604,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Calls he AMIE'S lovely name
4605,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,As he rushes o'er the fence.
4606,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4607,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Down toward the deep lake's side
4608,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Flies he now with greatest speed.
4609,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Forms among the bushes glide,"
4610,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Sorely is the lover tried
4611,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,In this saddest hour of need.
4612,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4613,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Who can paint his grief of mind
4614,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,As the lifeless form he views?
4615,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Vainly strives he peace to find,"
4616,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,This stroke seems the most unkind;
4617,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,He all comfort does refuse.
4618,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4619,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"AMIE'S face has lost its bloom,"
4620,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Though her countenance is fair.
4621,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Little ANN within the room
4622,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Deeply shares the general gloom,"
4623,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,In a dim lit corner there.
4624,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4625,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Some make efforts to restore
4626,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,That sweet girl they loved so well.
4627,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Too long time elapsed before
4628,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Her dear form was drawn to shore.
4629,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,Death has cast o'er her his spell.
4630,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4631,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"Women kind now lay her out,"
4632,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,In pure white her corpse invest.
4633,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"WILLIAM then, by nature taught,"
4634,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,"With poetic feeling fraught,"
4635,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,This warm song to her addressed:
4636,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4637,WILLIAM AND AMELIA,
4638,SONG TO AMELIA.,SONG TO AMELIA.
4639,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4640,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Still like to Luna wading,"
4641,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Beneath yon silvery cloud,"
4642,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Thy beauties are unfading,"
4643,SONG TO AMELIA.,Though mantled in a shroud.
4644,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4645,SONG TO AMELIA.,"As thou in death art lying,"
4646,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Thy lovely form I view,"
4647,SONG TO AMELIA.,And ask if aught in dying
4648,SONG TO AMELIA.,Has made thy charms seem new.
4649,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4650,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Say, wert thou conscious ever"
4651,SONG TO AMELIA.,That I to thee was true?
4652,SONG TO AMELIA.,That naught but death could sever
4653,SONG TO AMELIA.,The bond 'twixt me and you?
4654,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4655,SONG TO AMELIA.,I came with heart nigh bursting
4656,SONG TO AMELIA.,From thee to get relief.
4657,SONG TO AMELIA.,My very soul was thirsting
4658,SONG TO AMELIA.,To let thee share its grief.
4659,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4660,SONG TO AMELIA.,And now this stroke has fallen
4661,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Like thunderbolt on me,"
4662,SONG TO AMELIA.,And my poor heart is swollen
4663,SONG TO AMELIA.,With saddest misery.
4664,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4665,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Oh, where can I be flying"
4666,SONG TO AMELIA.,For strength and succor now?
4667,SONG TO AMELIA.,"If there were hope in dying,"
4668,SONG TO AMELIA.,I soon to death would bow.
4669,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4670,SONG TO AMELIA.,But now my duty strongly
4671,SONG TO AMELIA.,Bids me my task fulfil;
4672,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Thy family suffered wrongly,"
4673,SONG TO AMELIA.,To right them I've the will.
4674,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4675,SONG TO AMELIA.,And then I would be leaving
4676,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Each bitter scene of woe,"
4677,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Haply my loss retrieving,"
4678,SONG TO AMELIA.,If that can be below.
4679,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4680,SONG TO AMELIA.,Thou wert to me oft speaking
4681,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Of God's sweet place of Rest,"
4682,SONG TO AMELIA.,"I would that place be seeking,"
4683,SONG TO AMELIA.,To be with thee most blest.
4684,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4685,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Farewell, my young life's charmer,"
4686,SONG TO AMELIA.,"A long, a last farewell;"
4687,SONG TO AMELIA.,I feel my heart grow warmer
4688,SONG TO AMELIA.,As on thy love I dwell.
4689,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4690,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4691,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Calls he HUMBLEWORTH aside,"
4692,SONG TO AMELIA.,Speaks to him with faltering tongue:
4693,SONG TO AMELIA.,"""Father's sin I dare not hide;"
4694,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Me he bade before he died,"
4695,SONG TO AMELIA.,Soon redress your grievous wrong.
4696,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4697,SONG TO AMELIA.,"""He destroyed your uncle's _will_,"
4698,SONG TO AMELIA.,"When you were a little boy,"
4699,SONG TO AMELIA.,And did not his part fulfil
4700,SONG TO AMELIA.,"As your proper guardian still,"
4701,SONG TO AMELIA.,Losing peace of mind and joy.
4702,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4703,SONG TO AMELIA.,"""I'm prepared to give a _deed_"
4704,SONG TO AMELIA.,"To you of that large estate,"
4705,SONG TO AMELIA.,But I strongly intercede
4706,SONG TO AMELIA.,"For my mother in her need,"
4707,SONG TO AMELIA.,"In her sad affliction great."""
4708,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4709,SONG TO AMELIA.,"""My dear friend,"" the good man said,"
4710,SONG TO AMELIA.,"""Let some time now pass away."
4711,SONG TO AMELIA.,"I am not of you afraid,"
4712,SONG TO AMELIA.,"His command you have obeyed,"
4713,SONG TO AMELIA.,Let us talk some other day.
4714,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4715,SONG TO AMELIA.,"""Go, my boy, and cheer the heart"
4716,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Of your mother, still my friend;"
4717,SONG TO AMELIA.,"See, I bid you now depart,"
4718,SONG TO AMELIA.,Lest delay increase her smart;
4719,SONG TO AMELIA.,I will soon to it attend.
4720,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4721,SONG TO AMELIA.,"""Learn to place in Christ your trust;"
4722,SONG TO AMELIA.,Seek for pardon through His blood.
4723,SONG TO AMELIA.,"God alone can keep you just,"
4724,SONG TO AMELIA.,For we are at best but dust;
4725,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Naught have we ourselves of good."""
4726,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4727,SONG TO AMELIA.,WILLIAM hastens to the Hall
4728,SONG TO AMELIA.,With a somewhat easier mind.
4729,SONG TO AMELIA.,Fearing that it might appal
4730,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Mother's heart, he tells not all"
4731,SONG TO AMELIA.,That befel their friends so kind.
4732,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4733,SONG TO AMELIA.,Now an inquest has been held
4734,SONG TO AMELIA.,"O'er AMELIA'S corpse so fair,"
4735,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Tears have from their fountains welled,"
4736,SONG TO AMELIA.,"Grief immoderate has been quelled,"
4737,SONG TO AMELIA.,Which has brought of peace a share.
4738,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4739,SONG TO AMELIA.,Now arrangements have been made
4740,SONG TO AMELIA.,Suiting all who are concerned.
4741,SONG TO AMELIA.,"HUMBLEWORTHS such love displayed,"
4742,SONG TO AMELIA.,"As proved all that I have said,"
4743,SONG TO AMELIA.,Showing in whose school they learned.
4744,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4745,SONG TO AMELIA.,"To the Hall, as theirs of right,"
4746,SONG TO AMELIA.,All the family removed;
4747,SONG TO AMELIA.,And they strove with all their might
4748,SONG TO AMELIA.,"To make the widow's burden light,"
4749,SONG TO AMELIA.,"For she was by them, beloved."
4750,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4751,SONG TO AMELIA.,As assistant on the farm
4752,SONG TO AMELIA.,WILLIAM proved of greatest use.
4753,SONG TO AMELIA.,"With a heart both young and warm,"
4754,SONG TO AMELIA.,He soon found that ANNIE'S charm
4755,SONG TO AMELIA.,For lost time was some excuse.
4756,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4757,SONG TO AMELIA.,Why should I prolong this tale?
4758,SONG TO AMELIA.,All my object may divine.
4759,SONG TO AMELIA.,Christian love will still prevail
4760,SONG TO AMELIA.,"O'er its foes when they assail,"
4761,SONG TO AMELIA.,And it will forever shine.
4762,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4763,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4764,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4765,SONG TO AMELIA.,
4766,MY GARDEN,MY GARDEN
4767,MY GARDEN,
4768,MY GARDEN,
4769,MY GARDEN,"I have a little garden plot,"
4770,MY GARDEN,'Tis very small indeed;
4771,MY GARDEN,"But yet it is a pleasant spot,"
4772,MY GARDEN,"And plenty large enough, I wot,"
4773,MY GARDEN,When out-door work I need.
4774,MY GARDEN,
4775,MY GARDEN,"Two woodbines flourish at my door,"
4776,MY GARDEN,And climb above its porch;
4777,MY GARDEN,"One yields of grateful scent a store,"
4778,MY GARDEN,One flowers till all the summer's o'er
4779,MY GARDEN,And winter days approach.
4780,MY GARDEN,
4781,MY GARDEN,"And o'er the walls grape vines are spread,"
4782,MY GARDEN,Which bring delicious fruit;
4783,MY GARDEN,"These also sweetest odors shed,"
4784,MY GARDEN,And please my senses till I'm led
4785,MY GARDEN,To hold them in repute.
4786,MY GARDEN,
4787,MY GARDEN,"And then I have of peach trees three,"
4788,MY GARDEN,"Which have begun to bear,"
4789,MY GARDEN,And 'tis a pleasing sight to see
4790,MY GARDEN,My somewhat numerous family
4791,MY GARDEN,All eager for a share.
4792,MY GARDEN,
4793,MY GARDEN,"Three apple trees I next would name,"
4794,MY GARDEN,Though fruit they ne'er gave me;
4795,MY GARDEN,"For this their tender age I blame,"
4796,MY GARDEN,"And other cause I cannot name,"
4797,MY GARDEN,And so I wait to see.
4798,MY GARDEN,
4799,MY GARDEN,"Some berry trees I also boast,"
4800,MY GARDEN,And these of different kinds.
4801,MY GARDEN,"Of flowering shrubs I have a host,"
4802,MY GARDEN,Which did in cash and labor cost
4803,MY GARDEN,What might affright some minds.
4804,MY GARDEN,
4805,MY GARDEN,"Four kinds of lilac here are grown,"
4806,MY GARDEN,"One double flowering cherry,"
4807,MY GARDEN,"And weeping _ditto_, not much known;"
4808,MY GARDEN,"Eight different sorts of rose I own,"
4809,MY GARDEN,And shrub that yields _snowberry_.
4810,MY GARDEN,
4811,MY GARDEN,"Of lily yea, and crocus, too,"
4812,MY GARDEN,"I've some varieties,"
4813,MY GARDEN,"And monkshood, pinks, and violets blue,"
4814,MY GARDEN,"Of double almonds not a few,"
4815,MY GARDEN,With two kinds of peonies.
4816,MY GARDEN,
4817,MY GARDEN,"Some polyanthus and foxglove,"
4818,MY GARDEN,"Sea-pinks, and columbine,"
4819,MY GARDEN,"Sweet-scented tulips, which I love,"
4820,MY GARDEN,Whose beauty has e'en power to move
4821,MY GARDEN,A heart less fond than mine.
4822,MY GARDEN,
4823,MY GARDEN,"The daisy and sunflower tall,"
4824,MY GARDEN,Present a contrast great;
4825,MY GARDEN,"One like to him who, proud in soul,"
4826,MY GARDEN,Expects his fellow men to fall
4827,MY GARDEN,Submissive at his feet.
4828,MY GARDEN,
4829,MY GARDEN,"The other, like true modesty,"
4830,MY GARDEN,Scarce lifts its lovely head
4831,MY GARDEN,Lest you its secret charms should see--
4832,MY GARDEN,"Just like a lovely maid, when she"
4833,MY GARDEN,Is to vain-glory dead.
4834,MY GARDEN,
4835,MY GARDEN,Sweet-briar and sweet-william claim
4836,MY GARDEN,"A notice from my pen,"
4837,MY GARDEN,For each of these can boast of fame;--
4838,MY GARDEN,Are better known than my poor name
4839,MY GARDEN,Among the race of men.
4840,MY GARDEN,
4841,MY GARDEN,"My hollyhocks and lichens fine,"
4842,MY GARDEN,"Spread out their charms to view,"
4843,MY GARDEN,And other pretty flowers are mine--
4844,MY GARDEN,"To speak whose praises I incline,"
4845,MY GARDEN,If but their names I knew.
4846,MY GARDEN,
4847,MY GARDEN,"Of annuals I have but few,"
4848,MY GARDEN,That fact I fully grant;
4849,MY GARDEN,"Yet I have larkspur, pink and blue,"
4850,MY GARDEN,And double poppies of rich hue.
4851,MY GARDEN,To serve me while the summer's new
4852,MY GARDEN,I've beds of rhubarb plant.
4853,MY GARDEN,
4854,MY GARDEN,"Some household herbs and fragrant thyme,"
4855,MY GARDEN,"With lettuce, sage, and mint,"
4856,MY GARDEN,Complete my stock; but had I time
4857,MY GARDEN,A lingering lesson swells my rhyme
4858,MY GARDEN,With many a moral hint.
4859,MY GARDEN,
4860,MY GARDEN,That as we rear in summer's glow.
4861,MY GARDEN,"Herbs, fruits and flowerets fair,"
4862,MY GARDEN,So may we in our natures grow
4863,MY GARDEN,Sweet flowers that may hereafter blow
4864,MY GARDEN,In Heaven's serener air.

4869,MY GARDEN,The Inebriate's Daughter's Appeal to Her Father.
4870,MY GARDEN,
4871,MY GARDEN,
4872,MY GARDEN,"One frosty night in bright moonlight,"
4873,MY GARDEN,I left my cheerful home;
4874,MY GARDEN,My thoughts were such I cared not much
4875,MY GARDEN,Which way I chanced to roam.
4876,MY GARDEN,With firmest tread my way I thread
4877,MY GARDEN,Through many a winding street
4878,MY GARDEN,"When drunkard's voice in tones not choice,"
4879,MY GARDEN,My startled ear did meet.
4880,MY GARDEN,
4881,MY GARDEN,He cursed a girl whose hair in curl
4882,MY GARDEN,Bespoke a tidy mother;
4883,MY GARDEN,"Whose clothes, though plain, wore not a stain,"
4884,MY GARDEN,Yet grief her words did smother
4885,MY GARDEN,Her beauteous eyes told then no lies
4886,MY GARDEN,While she looked at the man.
4887,MY GARDEN,"As nature brought the words she sought,"
4888,MY GARDEN,She this appeal began:
4889,MY GARDEN,
4890,MY GARDEN,"""Oh, father, leave this wretched place,"
4891,MY GARDEN,And hasten home with me;
4892,MY GARDEN,For mother and the darling babe
4893,MY GARDEN,Are in sad misery!
4894,MY GARDEN,They have not tasted any food
4895,MY GARDEN,Since morn of yesterday.
4896,MY GARDEN,Yet you should hear that mother dear
4897,MY GARDEN,For blessings on you pray.
4898,MY GARDEN,
4899,MY GARDEN,"""For when she prays aloud for you,"
4900,MY GARDEN,"Her tears they flow apace,"
4901,MY GARDEN,And deepest crimson doth suffuse
4902,MY GARDEN,Her ever lovely face.
4903,MY GARDEN,She says that she must leave us all
4904,MY GARDEN,"Before 'tis very long,"
4905,MY GARDEN,"To go to yonder Heaven above,"
4906,MY GARDEN,And join in Angel's song.
4907,MY GARDEN,
4908,MY GARDEN,"""And when she looks at our dear babe"
4909,MY GARDEN,Her tears flow forth again;
4910,MY GARDEN,"Yet never does she, father dear,"
4911,MY GARDEN,"In words of you complain,"
4912,MY GARDEN,But says that she will try to make
4913,MY GARDEN,A happy home for you.
4914,MY GARDEN,"Come ill, come well, whate'er betide,"
4915,MY GARDEN,She'll loving be and true.
4916,MY GARDEN,
4917,MY GARDEN,"""O, father, hasten with me, then,"
4918,MY GARDEN,Before my mother die!
4919,MY GARDEN,"When I left home, your charming boy"
4920,MY GARDEN,Most piteously did cry;
4921,MY GARDEN,It would have moved a heart of stone
4922,MY GARDEN,To see the tears he shed;
4923,MY GARDEN,His shrieks make worse the dreadful pain
4924,MY GARDEN,"In mother's throbbing head!"""
4925,MY GARDEN,
4926,MY GARDEN,"The drunkard stood in solemn mood,"
4927,MY GARDEN,In riveted attention.
4928,MY GARDEN,This strong appeal did make him feel
4929,MY GARDEN,Most serious apprehension.
4930,MY GARDEN,"He took the hand of maiden bland,"
4931,MY GARDEN,And hastened fast away;
4932,MY GARDEN,Nor turned his face on that dread place
4933,MY GARDEN,Which had made him its prey.
4934,MY GARDEN,
4935,MY GARDEN,They reached the house where that dear spouse
4936,MY GARDEN,Was breathing out her soul.
4937,MY GARDEN,"From sense of sin he rushes in,"
4938,MY GARDEN,Nor could himself control.
4939,MY GARDEN,Upon his knees in agonies
4940,MY GARDEN,"He cries aloud, ""My wife,"
4941,MY GARDEN,"Do speak to me, for I will be"
4942,MY GARDEN,"A husband, dear, through life!"""
4943,MY GARDEN,
4944,MY GARDEN,No voice there came; the vital flame
4945,MY GARDEN,"Had fled, of child and mother."
4946,MY GARDEN,"He could not stay, so turned away,"
4947,MY GARDEN,With look that made me shudder.
4948,MY GARDEN,That little girl with hair in curl
4949,MY GARDEN,At last to him doth speak:
4950,MY GARDEN,"""My father dear, your heart I'll cheer,"
4951,MY GARDEN,And blessings for you seek.
4952,MY GARDEN,
4953,MY GARDEN,"""How We must pray, she taught the way"
4954,MY GARDEN,Who now has gone to bliss.
4955,MY GARDEN,Nor would I be the least degree
4956,MY GARDEN,"In duty found remiss."""
4957,MY GARDEN,Her artless strain made him refrain
4958,MY GARDEN,From purposes most foul.
4959,MY GARDEN,"In after years she calmed his fears,"
4960,MY GARDEN,And saved at last his soul.
4961,MY GARDEN,
4962,MY GARDEN,
4963,MY GARDEN,
4964,MY GARDEN,
4965,MY GARDEN,To the Children in Mrs. Day's School.
4966,MY GARDEN,
4967,MY GARDEN,1853.
4968,MY GARDEN,
4969,MY GARDEN,
4970,MY GARDEN,"My dearest children, do you know"
4971,MY GARDEN,"That best of all things here below,"
4972,MY GARDEN,"And knowing, you should always show"
4973,MY GARDEN,To one another
4974,MY GARDEN,"Which when received doth warm the breast,"
4975,MY GARDEN,"To troubled souls imparts sweet rest,"
4976,MY GARDEN,And makes each near connection blest--
4977,MY GARDEN,Of friend or brother.
4978,MY GARDEN,
4979,MY GARDEN,This precious thing has power to melt
4980,MY GARDEN,"Man's stubborn heart, as I have felt,"
4981,MY GARDEN,Subdue all sins that ever dwelt
4982,MY GARDEN,In men benighted.
4983,MY GARDEN,"If o'er this world 'twere shed abroad,"
4984,MY GARDEN,"The soldier soon might sheathe his sword,"
4985,MY GARDEN,"And God alone would be adored,"
4986,MY GARDEN,And all things righted.
4987,MY GARDEN,
4988,MY GARDEN,What is this thing of which I speak?
4989,MY GARDEN,"It can be found by those who seek,"
4990,MY GARDEN,"With willing mind and spirit meek,"
4991,MY GARDEN,Intent on finding.
4992,MY GARDEN,"It has its origin above,"
4993,MY GARDEN,More beauteous is than any dove;
4994,MY GARDEN,"Those who have felt it know 'tis Love,"
4995,MY GARDEN,And well worth minding.
4996,MY GARDEN,

5636,ODE TO PEACE,"Beside his father, and his end was peace."
5637,ODE TO PEACE,
5638,ODE TO PEACE,"Jacob, his youngest son, Supplanter named,"
5639,ODE TO PEACE,"Parent of Patriarchs so greatly famed,"
5640,ODE TO PEACE,Found too that peace of mind was always sweet
5641,ODE TO PEACE,When he sojourned with Laban in retreat.
5642,ODE TO PEACE,"What was it, I would ask, which made him bear"
5643,ODE TO PEACE,The heat by day and midnight's frosty air?
5644,ODE TO PEACE,The loss of cattle stolen from his hands?
5645,ODE TO PEACE,"Such churlish conduct, and such harsh commands?"
5646,ODE TO PEACE,"With loss of sleep, and wages changed ten times,"
5647,ODE TO PEACE,And twenty rigorous years in wasting climes?
5648,ODE TO PEACE,"What was it then, I ask, but peace of mind"
5649,ODE TO PEACE,Arising from the thought that God was kind
5650,ODE TO PEACE,"And ever faithful, and would soon fulfill"
5651,ODE TO PEACE,"His promise made, to be his Guardian still!"
5652,ODE TO PEACE,"He had sore trials, yet with great avail"
5653,ODE TO PEACE,He wrestled with his God and did prevail.
5654,ODE TO PEACE,
5655,ODE TO PEACE,"Joseph, his son, beloved above the rest,"
5656,ODE TO PEACE,Felt soothing peace within his youthful breast.
5657,ODE TO PEACE,His is an history that as a child
5658,ODE TO PEACE,"I loved to ponder, and to mark how mild"
5659,ODE TO PEACE,"And affable his conduct, yet how great."
5660,ODE TO PEACE,"The bitterest envy joined, with fiercest hate,"
5661,ODE TO PEACE,The brethren hare toward the godly youth
5662,ODE TO PEACE,"Who trode the path of rectitude and truth,"
5663,ODE TO PEACE,"That they in spite of his prophetic dreams,"
5664,ODE TO PEACE,"Disposed of him, and, as they thought, the themes"
5665,ODE TO PEACE,"His soul dwelt much upon, by banishment."
5666,ODE TO PEACE,"Straitway to distant Egypt he was sent,"
5667,ODE TO PEACE,"While they, with strange feigned tale, now homeward came,"
5668,ODE TO PEACE,And vainly thought to clear themselves from blame
5669,ODE TO PEACE,By falsehood foul and black hypocricy
5670,ODE TO PEACE,Before their unsuspecting father. He
5671,ODE TO PEACE,Their lies believed and mourned his much-loved son
5672,ODE TO PEACE,"In tears of anguish, whom he though undone."
5673,ODE TO PEACE,
5674,ODE TO PEACE,"Meanwhile the youth, directed by his God,"
5675,ODE TO PEACE,In journey with the Ishmaelites did plod
5676,ODE TO PEACE,His weary way to Egypt. He arrived
5677,ODE TO PEACE,"Possessed of peace of mind, nor could be bribed"
5678,ODE TO PEACE,"To part with this, his only treasure left"
5679,ODE TO PEACE,"Save sweet reflection, when he was bereft"
5680,ODE TO PEACE,"By his hard brethren of the sweets of home,"
5681,ODE TO PEACE,And banished forth a wanderer to roam.
5682,ODE TO PEACE,"Say now, O Muse, what was the cause why he"
5683,ODE TO PEACE,Enjoyed a state of mind completely free
5684,ODE TO PEACE,From all the sad effects which freely flow
5685,ODE TO PEACE,In tasting long accumulated woe?
5686,ODE TO PEACE,"'Twas having peace, that best of all reward"
5687,ODE TO PEACE,To those--and none beside--who Truth regard.
5688,ODE TO PEACE,"And long as Joseph did in Egypt live,"
5689,ODE TO PEACE,The record of his life this truth did give.
5690,ODE TO PEACE,"Behold him when in his first master's house,"
5691,ODE TO PEACE,"Who placed beneath his care all but his spouse,"
5692,ODE TO PEACE,"How nobly he withstood temptation great,"
5693,ODE TO PEACE,How suitable his conduct to his state.
5694,ODE TO PEACE,Behold him when his mistress tried so hard
5695,ODE TO PEACE,To tempt him into sin. Did he regard
5696,ODE TO PEACE,Her strong entreaties or her flowing tears?
5697,ODE TO PEACE,"_Those_ fell like emptiness upon his ears,"
5698,ODE TO PEACE,And _these_ but more impressed his tender mind
5699,ODE TO PEACE,With wish to better serve his master kind.
5700,ODE TO PEACE,"He gave this answer: ""Oh, how can I do"
5701,ODE TO PEACE,This wickedness so great and sin with you
5702,ODE TO PEACE,Against that God who hath my feet preserved
5703,ODE TO PEACE,"In holy paths from which I never swerved?"""
5704,ODE TO PEACE,"But oh, what poor return did he receive!"
5705,ODE TO PEACE,"A dungeon followed next, nor did he grieve,"
5706,ODE TO PEACE,"But cheerfully endured the heavy cross,"
5707,ODE TO PEACE,And found his gain where others saw but loss.
5708,ODE TO PEACE,And he who was his trust did not forsake
5709,ODE TO PEACE,"His much loved child when Truth seemed all at stake,"
5710,ODE TO PEACE,"But brought him through these trials manifold,"
5711,ODE TO PEACE,"And, still preserved that peace of mind which gold"
5712,ODE TO PEACE,"Could ne'er have purchased, and much less secured;"
5713,ODE TO PEACE,"But having which, he patiently endured."
5714,ODE TO PEACE,
5715,ODE TO PEACE,Now mark the steps by which he did ascend
5716,ODE TO PEACE,"To that high pitch of honor, when did bend"
5717,ODE TO PEACE,The knees of Egypt's sons at King's command
5718,ODE TO PEACE,As he went forth in state to view the land.
5719,ODE TO PEACE,"It was not flatt'ry, nor vain compromise"
5720,ODE TO PEACE,"With Egypt's many gods no, he was wise"
5721,ODE TO PEACE,"With wisdom from above, and well he knew"
5722,ODE TO PEACE,"That the predictions he had given were true,"
5723,ODE TO PEACE,And that ere long both heaven and earth would see
5724,ODE TO PEACE,His youthful dreams fulfilled were sure to be.
5725,ODE TO PEACE,Even so they were. His brethren did bow down
5726,ODE TO PEACE,"Their faces to the earth 'fore him unknown,"
5727,ODE TO PEACE,When they were sent by Jacob to obtain
5728,ODE TO PEACE,For him and his the necessary grain.
5729,ODE TO PEACE,"It was a time of famine, and the dearth"
5730,ODE TO PEACE,Had then extended over all the earth
5731,ODE TO PEACE,"But Joseph was raised up by gracious heaven,"
5732,ODE TO PEACE,And unto him for this was wisdom given.
5733,ODE TO PEACE,"Now when his feelings he could not restrain,"
5734,ODE TO PEACE,He formed a scheme by which he might detain
5735,ODE TO PEACE,"The brethren, who a second time had come"
5736,ODE TO PEACE,"To purchase food, for those they left at home."
5737,ODE TO PEACE,The scheme was tried and it succeeded well;
5738,ODE TO PEACE,"But O, how Joseph burned to break the spell"
5739,ODE TO PEACE,Which hitherto had bound them! He made known
5740,ODE TO PEACE,That he was Joseph to whom they had shown
5741,ODE TO PEACE,"Such cruel usage, but their deed forgave,"
5742,ODE TO PEACE,And told how God had raised him up to save
5743,ODE TO PEACE,Them with their offspring and great Pharoah's land.
5744,ODE TO PEACE,"The news now reached the King, who gave command,"
5745,ODE TO PEACE,"""Joseph, let all thy relatives appear"
5746,ODE TO PEACE,Before my face; they nothing have to fear.
5747,ODE TO PEACE,Lade all their beasts and bid them haste away;
5748,ODE TO PEACE,"Take wagons from my hand, make no delay."
5749,ODE TO PEACE,Inform your father and let him come down;
5750,ODE TO PEACE,The best of my dominions is his own.
5751,ODE TO PEACE,"Bring all your progeny, not once regard"
5752,ODE TO PEACE,"Your household goods, if they your speed retard."""
5753,ODE TO PEACE,
5754,ODE TO PEACE,"I'll now take leave of all that passed between,"
5755,ODE TO PEACE,And come at once to that affecting scene--
5756,ODE TO PEACE,The meeting of the father with the son.
5757,ODE TO PEACE,Poor Jacob saw what glory he had won
5758,ODE TO PEACE,"By perseverance in the ""narrow path,"""
5759,ODE TO PEACE,"And having seen it, wished to meet his death."
5760,ODE TO PEACE,
5761,ODE TO PEACE,"Mark now the truth of what I wish to sing,"
5762,ODE TO PEACE,This interview to Jacob peace did bring.
5763,ODE TO PEACE,"He said: ""In bitterness I will descend"
5764,ODE TO PEACE,"Into my grave and meet my latter end."""
5765,ODE TO PEACE,But God in mercy and rich love decreed
5766,ODE TO PEACE,That he should see both Joseph and his seed.
5767,ODE TO PEACE,
5768,ODE TO PEACE,Ere long the time arrived when Jacob's age
5769,ODE TO PEACE,Gave proof he too must soon leave this world's stage.
5770,ODE TO PEACE,"Therefore he gathered round him, near his bed,"
5771,ODE TO PEACE,"His twelve dear children, unto whom he said,"
5772,ODE TO PEACE,"""List now, ye sons of Jacob, hearken well"
5773,ODE TO PEACE,To Israel your father. I foretell
5774,ODE TO PEACE,What shall befall you in your latter days.
5775,ODE TO PEACE,"O then, my sons, take heed unto your ways."""
5776,ODE TO PEACE,He ended not till all received the share
5777,ODE TO PEACE,"Which God allotted them, when with due care"
5778,ODE TO PEACE,"The Prophet drew his feet into the bed,"
5779,ODE TO PEACE,And in sweet Peace his spirit softly fled.
5780,ODE TO PEACE,
5781,ODE TO PEACE,"Now, when the last sad rites had been performed"
5782,ODE TO PEACE,"O'er Israel's corse, the brethren, now reformed"
5783,ODE TO PEACE,"By God's just dealings, soon began to fear"
5784,ODE TO PEACE,That Joseph would their enemy appear;
5785,ODE TO PEACE,"So sent a message, fell before his face,"
5786,ODE TO PEACE,"Confessed their sin, and wished he would erase"
5787,ODE TO PEACE,Out from his mind remembrance of their deed.
5788,ODE TO PEACE,"He gave soft answers, hence they all were freed"
5789,ODE TO PEACE,"From ills expected, and were now agreed."
5790,ODE TO PEACE,A few short years saw each of them removed
5791,ODE TO PEACE,"By peaceful death, and so my point is proved."

7594,XII.,A noise they hear--a sound as of great glee--
7595,XII.,The settlers in their breasts possessed a spark
7596,XII.,"Of sweet good nature, and now came to see"
7597,XII.,If they could not be useful to the family.
7598,XII.,
7599,XIII.,XIII.
7600,XIII.,
7601,XIII.,"This as an omen soon was understood,"
7602,XIII.,And pressing wants were to each friend made known.
7603,XIII.,"With axes armed these quick obtained some wood,"
7604,XIII.,Which by strong oxen speedily was drawn
7605,XIII.,To the selected spot that had been shown.
7606,XIII.,The Pastor's wife and daughters then prepare
7607,XIII.,"A good, substantial meal, and with kind tone"
7608,XIII.,"Invite the friends to come and taste their fare,"
7609,XIII.,Which they in gratitude had made with nicest care.
7610,XIII.,
7611,XIV.,XIV.
7612,XIV.,
7613,XIV.,With this good offer all at once complied;
7614,XIV.,They came to work and therefore needs must eat.
7615,XIV.,The day was fine and beech tree shade supplied
7616,XIV.,"A place for table, and each took a seat,"
7617,XIV.,Admiring much the dinner spread so neat.
7618,XIV.,And GOODWORTH then gave thanks most rev'rently
7619,XIV.,"For such sweet comforts in their wood's retreat,"
7620,XIV.,And prayed that each warm-hearted friend might be
7621,XIV.,Rewarded for his kindness in Eternity.
7622,XIV.,
7623,XV.,XV.
7624,XV.,
7625,XV.,"The dinner o'er, awhile in friendly chat"
7626,XV.,They sat and rested till the cattle fed.
7627,XV.,Then GOODWORTH freely spoke to them of what
7628,XV.,"He and his family to that place had led,"
7629,XV.,And sweetly mentioned Him that once had bled--
7630,XV.,"The great God-man, who, sinners came to save."
7631,XV.,"These men in silence heard all he had said,"
7632,XV.,"And some shed tears, and all looked very grave,"
7633,XV.,Though each rude breast possessed a heart most truly brave.
7634,XV.,
7635,XVI.,XVI.
7636,XVI.,
7637,XVI.,"Once more bright axes, wielded by strong arms"
7638,XVI.,"Make chips fly fast, as they the logs prepare;"
7639,XVI.,"Such willing work the Pastor's family charms,"
7640,XVI.,For they this kindness had not thought to share.
7641,XVI.,A strong foundation now is laid with care;
7642,XVI.,"Of ample size, the fabric upward grows;"
7643,XVI.,"The men take pains to have the corners square,"
7644,XVI.,Which to effect the spare nor strength nor blows;
7645,XVI.,"And thus, as if by magic, that neat structure rose."
7646,XVI.,
7647,XVII.,XVII.
7648,XVII.,
7649,XVII.,"Meanwhile, there came some shingles, nails and boards,"
7650,XVII.,"Brought by two teams, which only now were seen;"
7651,XVII.,And this fresh kindness fullest proof affords
7652,XVII.,"That GOODWORTH'S object was approved, I ween."
7653,XVII.,Now some for rafters a long way had been;
7654,XVII.,"And, as the sun had sunk into the West,"
7655,XVII.,"The women had prepared their table clean,"
7656,XVII.,"Well laden, as before, with food; the best"
7657,XVII.,Which they had power to furnish in that wild wood-nest.
7658,XVII.,
7659,XVIII.,XVIII.
7660,XVIII.,
7661,XVIII.,Warm thanks are given: the workers fall to work
7662,XVIII.,To do full justice to that savory meal.
7663,XVIII.,No wicked feelings in their bosoms lurk
7664,XVIII.,Against the family; but they strongly feel
7665,XVIII.,"They have an interest in all their weal,"
7666,XVIII.,And freely speak of coming back next day
7667,XVIII.,The house to finish; kindly thus they deal
7668,XVIII.,With those dear folks--who wish them still to stay--
7669,XVIII.,"And they will sing awhile, to cheer them on their way."
7670,XVIII.,
7671,XIX.,XIX.
7672,XIX.,
7673,XIX.,To this they all consented; then arose
7674,XIX.,"Song after song, in praise of Jesus' name!"
7675,XIX.,"Such songs can lighten e'en our saddest woes,"
7676,XIX.,And raise in human hearts a heavenly flame.
7677,XIX.,"Six men there were who, from that night, became"
7678,XIX.,Quite altered characters--as all might see.
7679,XIX.,For Gospel Truth can e'en a savage tame;
7680,XIX.,Though this to some men seems a mystery--
7681,XIX.,Such have not seen themselves sunk in depravity.
7682,XIX.,
7683,XX.,XX.
7684,XX.,
7685,XX.,"The singing o'er, the good man said, ""Let's pray."""
7686,XX.,All down beside him reverently knelt;
7687,XX.,It was a proper close for such a day--
7688,XX.,As all engaged must then have deeply felt.
7689,XX.,"And oh, the language of that prayer did melt"
7690,XX.,"Some stony hearts, as I in truth would tell:"
7691,XX.,For GOODWORTH on God's love and mercy dwelt--
7692,XX.,On coming judgment--and on Heaven and Hell--
7693,XX.,Till every one seemed bound as by the strongest spell.
7694,XX.,
7695,XXI.,XXI.
7696,XXI.,
7697,XXI.,"This done, those neighbors--though reluctantly--"
7698,XXI.,Took leave of that most happy household there:
7699,XXI.,And were as pleased as any men could be
7700,XXI.,They were allowed such company to share.
7701,XXI.,"'Twas Spring time, and the still and balmy air"
7702,XXI.,Was most refreshing to the wearied frame;
7703,XXI.,"And Luna's brightness, though quite free from glare,"
7704,XXI.,Enabled them to see which way they came--
7705,XXI.,For staying rather late they would incur no blame.
7706,XXI.,
7707,XXII.,XXII.
7708,XXII.,
7709,XXII.,"The morning came, and with alacrity"
7710,XXII.,"Came settlers also, ready as before"
7711,XXII.,To help the welcome new-come family
7712,XXII.,"Whose strange, deep news had made their hearts so sore."
7713,XXII.,And now the labor of the day each bore
7714,XXII.,As if his own advantage he would seek.
7715,XXII.,"Some went to roofing, some to fix the door"
7716,XXII.,"And windows, and with hearts and arms not weak,"
7717,XXII.,"They make the work fly fast, scarce leaving time to speak."
7718,XXII.,
7719,XXIII.,XXIII.
7720,XXIII.,
7721,XXIII.,"The muster, greater this day than the last,"
7722,XXIII.,Left some hands free to clear a piece of ground;
7723,XXIII.,"And these, with brush-hooks, o'er two acres passed,"
7724,XXIII.,Making good riddance of what brush they found.
7725,XXIII.,They then cut down some poles and fenced it round.
7726,XXIII.,"The family, too, were busy all this while,"
7727,XXIII.,For they were moved with gratitude profound
7728,XXIII.,To show their thankfulness in many a smile.
7729,XXIII.,Their happy faces do the laborers' hearts beguile.
7730,XXIII.,
7731,XXIV.,XXIV.
7732,XXIV.,
7733,XXIV.,The meal-times passed with pleasure and some profit;
7734,XXIV.,Naught did occur to mar the harmony.
7735,XXIV.,"If there were whisky every one kept off it,"
7736,XXIV.,And all confessed they worked more easily.
7737,XXIV.,"Too often liquor in the woods we see,"
7738,XXIV.,And much vile mischief is it apt to do
7739,XXIV.,"When neighbors come to help at Logging-bee,"
7740,XXIV.,Or to assist each other at the plow.
7741,XXIV.,It pleases me to see this practice broken through.
7742,XXIV.,
7743,XXV.,XXV.
7744,XXV.,
7745,XXV.,The Country would have reason to rejoice
7746,XXV.,"If not a drop were as a beverage used,"
7747,XXV.,And I would not be slow to raise my voice
7748,XXV.,Till Temperance principles are more diffused.
7749,XXV.,"For this by some folks I may be abused,"
7750,XXV.,"But where's the harm? I seek alone their good,"
7751,XXV.,And cannot be by conscience well excused
7752,XXV.,If I refuse my aid to stem the flood
7753,XXV.,Which drowns its thousands of our common brotherhood.
7754,XXV.,
7755,XXVI.,XXVI.
7756,XXVI.,
7757,XXVI.,"But to return: The work had so well sped,"
7758,XXVI.,And the new house was so far on the way
7759,XXVI.,"Toward completion, that the family's head"
7760,XXVI.,"Thought they might safely move that very day,"
7761,XXVI.,But first enquired what there would be to pay?
7762,XXVI.,"The neighbors smiled and kept the secret close,"
7763,XXVI.,And what the bill was none thought fit to say.
7764,XXVI.,"For satisfaction ""he must ask the _Boss_."""
7765,XXVI.,To tell who _that_ was every one felt quite at loss.
7766,XXVI.,
7767,XXVII.,XXVII.
7768,XXVII.,
7769,XXVII.,"Is this exaggeration? Witness now,"
7770,XXVII.,"Ye far backwoodsmen--much too oft belied,"
7771,XXVII.,Are ye inclined these things to disavow?
7772,XXVII.,Or will my statements be by you denied?
7773,XXVII.,"If not they stand for truth both far and wide,"
7774,XXVII.,And your example may be found of use
7775,XXVII.,In leading others quickly to decide
7776,XXVII.,That they for ignorance have no excuse
7777,XXVII.,"In this enlightened age, when Knowledge is diffuse."
7778,XXVII.,
7779,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
7780,XXVIII.,
7781,XXVIII.,I need not mention every little thing
7782,XXVIII.,That was required to make the house complete.
7783,XXVIII.,My humble Muse would now attempt to sing
7784,XXVIII.,Of subjects which to her are far more sweet.
7785,XXVIII.,"The Pastor happy lived in his retreat,"
7786,XXVIII.,"Preaching on Sabbath, in a school-house near."
7787,XXVIII.,"There many came who could not get a seat,"
7788,XXVIII.,"And such large audience did the Pastor cheer,"
7789,XXVIII.,Who spoke to them with zeal--for they to him were dear.
7790,XXVIII.,
7791,XXIX.,XXIX.
7792,XXIX.,
7793,XXIX.,"I may be asked, ""What was this man's persuasion?"
7794,XXIX.,"Was he a Churchman or a Methodist?"""
7795,XXIX.,"I answer make without the least evasion,"
7796,XXIX.,"He owned no ""ism,"" nor yet ""ite,"" nor ""ist."""
7797,XXIX.,"But if on further knowledge you insist,"
7798,XXIX.,I only say that he was glad to own
7799,XXIX.,"The ""Blood-bought Throng"" wherever they exist."
7800,XXIX.,"Nor did he scruple to let this be known,"
7801,XXIX.,The BIBLE still the Source from which his creed was drawn.
7802,XXIX.,
7803,XXX.,XXX.
7804,XXX.,
7805,XXX.,From it he gathered that ev'n two or three
7806,XXX.,Met in Christ's name a Church of God do make;
7807,XXX.,"That, when so met, they have full liberty"
7808,XXX.,On each Lord's Day the Bread and Wine to take.
7809,XXX.,"All vain traditions they in this forsake,"
7810,XXX.,But get rich blessing from the King of Kings.
7811,XXX.,"And in that lonely house near Huron's Lake,"
7812,XXX.,The family enjoyed the bliss which springs
7813,XXX.,"From means well used, and these afresh each Sabbath brings."
7814,XXX.,
7815,XXXI.,XXXI.
7816,XXXI.,
7817,XXXI.,"The six of whom I spoke some pages back,"
7818,XXXI.,Sought early fellowship with that small band.
7819,XXXI.,"These of great sorrow had displayed no lack,"
7820,XXXI.,"And now as Christians publicly they stand,"
7821,XXXI.,"Unto Christ's work they give each heart and hand,"
7822,XXXI.,"And one of them called Luth, possessed of means,"
7823,XXXI.,Resolved at once to give a piece of land
7824,XXXI.,"On which to build a chapel, midst sweet scenes;"
7825,XXXI.,"A very central place, and near two deep ravines."
7826,XXXI.,
7827,XXXII.,XXXII.
7828,XXXII.,
7829,XXXII.,Nor was this all; he gave some good pine trees
7830,XXXII.,And other requisites to build the place;
7831,XXXII.,"The work he knew would all be done by ""Bees."""
7832,XXXII.,The friends the opportunity embrace
7833,XXXII.,To make the matter fully known all round.
7834,XXXII.,Strong opposition they had now to face
7835,XXXII.,"From those who rather would in sin be found,"
7836,XXXII.,And such cared nothing for the glorious Gospel sound.
7837,XXXII.,
7838,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
7839,XXXIII.,
7840,XXXIII.,"The Minister proposed to wait awhile,"
7841,XXXIII.,Till this grave subject could be well discussed.
7842,XXXIII.,"He wished that none would act from motives vile,"
7843,XXXIII.,"For popularity he did not lust,"
7844,XXXIII.,And in his Father he could always trust;
7845,XXXIII.,"Advised to seek God's mind by earnest prayer,"
7846,XXXIII.,In generosity to be still just;
7847,XXXIII.,By such means only could they hope to share
7848,XXXIII.,God's constant approbation and His guardian care.
7849,XXXIII.,
7850,XXXIV.,XXXIV.
7851,XXXIV.,
7852,XXXIV.,This prudent course ensured the object sought.
7853,XXXIV.,"Some who opposed did, of their own accord"
7854,XXXIV.,"Propose assistance, and with vigor wrought"
7855,XXXIV.,To raise the humble Chapel to the Lord.
7856,XXXIV.,"Dear GOODWORTH wielded skilfully the sword,"
7857,XXXIV.,Which by God's blessing pierced into the souls
7858,XXXIV.,"Of those who came to hear the plain-taught Word,"
7859,XXXIV.,"Whose rich Truth, for Sin's pleasures lost, consoles,"
7860,XXXIV.,And cheers and strengthens those whose lust it still controls.
7861,XXXIV.,
7862,XXXV.,XXXV.
7863,XXXV.,
7864,XXXV.,Truly it was a lovely sight to see
7865,XXXV.,The opening of that place of worship pure.
7866,XXXV.,"There was displayed no animosity,"
7867,XXXV.,All seemed at home in perfect peace secure.
7868,XXXV.,Sweet gospel sermons fitted to allure
7869,XXXV.,The erring sons and daughters of mankind
7870,XXXV.,"Were preached that day, and I feel very sure"
7871,XXXV.,"It was no ""blind man's leading of the blind,"""
7872,XXXV.,But preaching of that sort which is for good designed.
7873,XXXV.,
7874,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
7875,XXXVI.,
7876,XXXVI.,"The music was by voices rich and clear,"
7877,XXXVI.,"The words the language of most grateful hearts,"
7878,XXXVI.,All forming worship void of slavish fear;
7879,XXXVI.,"Most orderly besides in all its parts,"
7880,XXXVI.,Though the performers knew not much of arts
7881,XXXVI.,On which some pride themselves in this our day;
7882,XXXVI.,"Nor was the singing done by fits and starts,"
7883,XXXVI.,As if God's service were but childish play.
7884,XXXVI.,They knew His Eye was on their secret thoughts alway.
7885,XXXVI.,
7886,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
7887,XXXVII.,
7888,XXXVII.,I must not fail to mention the chief thing
7889,XXXVII.,For which all saints should meet on Sabbath day;
7890,XXXVII.,"But first my Muse would boldly spread her wing,"
7891,XXXVII.,For she could always on this subject stay.
7892,XXXVII.,"Your kind indulgence, reader, I would pray,"
7893,XXXVII.,As this sweet topic is most dear to me.
7894,XXXVII.,"Most gracious Savior, who for me didst pay"
7895,XXXVII.,"Thy precious blood upon the cursed tree,"
7896,XXXVII.,That I might be redeemed from sin and misery.
7897,XXXVII.,
7898,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
7899,XXXVIII.,
7900,XXXVIII.,Grant me Thy Spirit's aid while I attempt
7901,XXXVIII.,"A true description of thy ""Feast of Love"""
7902,XXXVIII.,"May I from evil motives be exempt,"
7903,XXXVIII.,Nor mention aught but what Thou wilt approve.
7904,XXXVIII.,"That small, dear family ""born, from above,"""
7905,XXXVIII.,"Just numbering twelve, around the table meet."
7906,XXXVIII.,"Each one displays the meekness of the dove,"
7907,XXXVIII.,And hopes to share a most delicious treat
7908,XXXVIII.,In joining thus with Jesus in Communion sweet.
7909,XXXVIII.,
7910,XXXIX.,XXXIX.
7911,XXXIX.,
7912,XXXIX.,And now the Pastor thought it right to tell
7913,XXXIX.,What were the principles on which they met;
7914,XXXIX.,For great misapprehension he knew well
7915,XXXIX.,"Prevailed abroad, and some men's minds beset."
7916,XXXIX.,He trusted no one present would forget
7917,XXXIX.,That the pure Bible was their only guide.
7918,XXXIX.,"They had no human system to abet,"
7919,XXXIX.,Nor would they by man's arguments be tried.
7920,XXXIX.,What say the Scriptures? these alone the case decide.

7923,XL.,
7924,XL.,"He said, ""We meet, dear friends, in Jesus' name;"

7927,XL.,"It is but right we should obedient be,"
7928,XL.,"And O, what wondrous love we here do see!"
7929,XL.,To think we are invited all to feast
7930,XL.,With Jesus in His glorious majesty.
7931,XL.,"This is a marvel, and 'tis much increased"

7947,XLII.,
7948,XLII.,"""We do this every First Day of the Week,"
7949,XLII.,Because of old God's people did the same;
7950,XLII.,This all may learn who will take pains to seek
7951,XLII.,The Word of Truth. All arguments are lame.
7952,XLII.,"Men use against it, and not free from blame."
7953,XLII.,"Can we, dear friends, remember Christ too often?"
7954,XLII.,"Ah, no indeed! To save our souls he came!"
7955,XLII.,"And his vast Love to us our hearts should soften,"

7962,XLIII.,"Oh, why should Christians in this way refuse"
7963,XLIII.,What to their souls would sweetest comfort bring?
7964,XLIII.,'_Remember Me_' should make our love to spring
7965,XLIII.,"Like water gushing from a fountain clear,"
7966,XLIII.,And tune our hearts each time afresh to sing
7967,XLIII.,"The praise of Jesus, and should make us rear"

7988,XLV.,"Suppose that these were brought to pasture fair,"
7989,XLV.,The gate of which was opened wide to them.
7990,XLV.,Would they wait for command to enter there?

8000,XLVI.,"O, let not any this plain feast deride;"
8001,XLVI.,There ne'er was Ordinance appointed yet

8019,XLVIII.,
8020,XLVIII.,Yet this day's joyous service was not o'er;
8021,XLVIII.,"Some met at night with GOODWORTH'S family,"
8022,XLVIII.,And there together searched the hidden store
8023,XLVIII.,"Of Bible truth, the prayer of Faith the key"
8024,XLVIII.,That did unlock each wondrous mystery.
8025,XLVIII.,"All were invited, nay were pressed to speak,"
8026,XLVIII.,And show the light which God gave them to see.

8036,XLIX.,"This did but strengthen pre-existing ties,"
8037,XLIX.,While warmer grew their hearts in Love's soft bands.
8038,XLIX.,"At nine o'clock reluctantly they rise,"
8039,XLIX.,"To part at last with cordial shake of hands,"
8040,XLIX.,"More fitted for the coming day, with its demands."
8041,XLIX.,
8042,L.,L.
8043,L.,
8044,L.,I offer the above as a fair sample
8045,L.,"Of this small Church's worship on First Days,"
8046,L.,And should be highly pleased if their example
8047,L.,Had on our minds an influence always.
8048,L.,"Their love and zeal are worthy of all praise,"
8049,L.,Though all they have or are is of God's grace.
8050,L.,"His love to them they view with deep amaze,"
8051,L.,And trust ere long to see him face to face
8052,L.,In heavenly Regions--His own happy Dwelling Place.
8053,L.,
8054,LI.,LI.
8055,LI.,
8056,LI.,"To spare the Reader risk of long digression,"
8057,LI.,"And keep within just bounds my humble tale,"
8058,LI.,I now in order give GOODWORTH'S profession
8059,LI.,That none to understand his views may fail.
8060,LI.,"Against these views some men no doubt will rail,"
8061,LI.,"But let such take the Bible in their hands,"
8062,LI.,And with Truth's weapons only them assail.
8063,LI.,"This the importance of the thing demands,"
8064,LI.,For by the Truth alone his doctrine falls or stands.
8065,LI.,
8066,LII.,LII.
8067,LII.,
8068,LII.,On Scriptural grounds of every Sinner's hope
8069,LII.,"He held no wavering views, for Truth shone clear"
8070,LII.,"Into his soul, and gave him power to cope"
8071,LII.,With Error's darkest forms. He had no fear
8072,LII.,Of man before his eyes. The spiteful sneer
8073,LII.,Of Antinomians and proud Pharisees
8074,LII.,"Disturbed him not, save to call forth a tear"
8075,LII.,From heartfelt pity for the vagaries
8076,LII.,Of their perverted judgments touching God's decrees.
8077,LII.,
8078,LIII.,LIII.
8079,LIII.,
8080,LIII.,"He held, then, that the Lord, who sees the end"
8081,LIII.,"From the beginning, did of his own pure grace"
8082,LIII.,"Choose some with him Eternity to spend,"
8083,LIII.,"From 'mongst the millions of our fallen race,"
8084,LIII.,Determined all such should behold his face
8085,LIII.,"In peace at last, in spite of Hell and sin."
8086,LIII.,"These would in time his Gospel Truth embrace,"
8087,LIII.,Or die incapable for Faith within.
8088,LIII.,Thus did he view the triumphs of God's Grace begin.
8089,LIII.,
8090,LIV.,LIV.
8091,LIV.,
8092,LIV.,"He saw God's Love--Superlative, Eternal,"
8093,LIV.,Gradually unfold the mystery
8094,LIV.,"To Man, who by Satanic schemes infernal,"
8095,LIV.,Had fall'n from happiness to misery.
8096,LIV.,And he by Faith's keen eye could clearly see
8097,LIV.,Its full development when Jesus came
8098,LIV.,The sinner's Surety and best Friend to be;
8099,LIV.,"Who ""bore the Cross and still despised the Shame,"""
8100,LIV.,Nor shrank from God's just wrath--a fiercely burning flame.
8101,LIV.,
8102,LV.,LV.
8103,LV.,
8104,LV.,"Christ's glorious Resurrection too, he saw"
8105,LV.,To be God's stamp of approbation great
8106,LV.,On that vicarious work which his just Law
8107,LV.,Fulfilled--a ground of hope commensurate
8108,LV.,To man's great needs in every age and state.
8109,LV.,These truths so filled his warm and generous soul
8110,LV.,That he on them would oft expatiate
8111,LV.,Until his feelings seemed beyond control;
8112,LV.,And this secured attention from his hearers all.
8113,LV.,
8114,LVI.,LVI.
8115,LVI.,
8116,LVI.,Of man's free will he had not any doubt;
8117,LVI.,Yet he as much believed the declaration
8118,LVI.,Of God's own Word--which some men dare to flout--
8119,LVI.,"That man's heart is, in every rank and station,"
8120,LVI.,"""Always deceitful,"" filled with profanation,"
8121,LVI.,"""And desparately wicked."" This none know"
8122,LVI.,"But God, who has provided expiation,"
8123,LVI.,And sent his Holy Spirit down to show
8124,LVI.,"These facts to sinners dead, and on them Life bestow."
8125,LVI.,
8126,LVII.,LVII.
8127,LVII.,
8128,LVII.,On final perseverance of all Saints
8129,LVII.,"He took the highest stand which man can take,"
8130,LVII.,And found in it a balm for most complaints
8131,LVII.,"Of Christian souls, to sense of sin awake."
8132,LVII.,This glorious truth to him would often make
8133,LVII.,Light shine in darkness and dispel his fear;
8134,LVII.,Oft led him to endure for Jesus' sake
8135,LVII.,"Loss of beloved objects, and appear"
8136,LVII.,"An ever happy man, 'midst prospects dark and drear."
8137,LVII.,
8138,LVIII.,LVIII.
8139,LVIII.,
8140,LVIII.,Besides the views I have already given
8141,LVIII.,He held it right that Christians all should use
8142,LVIII.,The talents they possess as gifts from heaven.
8143,LVIII.,"Neglect of this admits of no excuse,"
8144,LVIII.,Though there are times when men their gifts abuse.
8145,LVIII.,"As members of the Church all have their place,"
8146,LVIII.,And none well taught of God should e'er refuse
8147,LVIII.,To aid His cause according to the Grace
8148,LVIII.,Received since they were led Salvation to embrace.
8149,LVIII.,
8150,LIX.,LIX.
8151,LIX.,
8152,LIX.,"For peaceful rule and needful discipline,"
8153,LIX.,He held that churches should call two or more
8154,LIX.,"Of members, who well qualified had been,"
8155,LIX.,"As Elders, by God's Spirit to watch o'er"
8156,LIX.,"The flock of Christ; men skilled in Bible lore,"
8157,LIX.,"And ""apt to teach; not novices, but such"
8158,LIX.,"As have seen service in the Truth, and bore"
8159,LIX.,"Good characters becoming Christians much,"""
8160,LIX.,For only men like these should that high office touch.
8161,LIX.,
8162,LX.,LX.
8163,LX.,
8164,LX.,"Two or more Deacons they should also call,"
8165,LX.,Who by the Scripture rule are qualified
8166,LX.,"To keep the Church's funds, and still help all"
8167,LX.,Who may by poverty be sorely tried.
8168,LX.,"By such arrangements Churches should abide,"
8169,LX.,If they would faithful prove unto the Lord.
8170,LX.,We have no right to set His Laws aside;
8171,LX.,"Such conduct is by our Great Head abhorred,"
8172,LX.,And does with our profession very ill accord.
8173,LX.,
8174,LXI.,LXI.
8175,LXI.,
8176,LXI.,As this Church was but young it was deemed best
8177,LXI.,"That they should, as their pastor, him retain."
8178,LXI.,"He thanked them much for confidence expressed,"
8179,LXI.,And hoped it would not tend to make him vain.
8180,LXI.,"He thought it right his views thus to explain,"
8181,LXI.,And trusted they would give them due attention.
8182,LXI.,Should his poor life be spared he would remain
8183,LXI.,"And labor hard to keep them from declension,"
8184,LXI.,Though of their falling off he had no apprehension.
8185,LXI.,
8186,LXII.,LXII.
8187,LXII.,
8188,LXII.,The Salary question next came on the board.
8189,LXII.,"What should the amount be, how or whence obtained?"
8190,LXII.,The Church itself could not the means afford;
8191,LXII.,Perhaps some others might assistance lend--
8192,LXII.,But would the pastor such a course commend?
8193,LXII.,Had they consulted him at first they would
8194,LXII.,Have found they had no cause to apprehend
8195,LXII.,A lack of means to serve intentions good;
8196,LXII.,He wished to labor freely for Christ's brotherhood.
8197,LXII.,
8198,LXIII.,LXIII.
8199,LXIII.,
8200,LXIII.,He and his family needed then no aid
8201,LXIII.,Except what new-come Settlers might require.
8202,LXIII.,And obligation was upon him laid
8203,LXIII.,To seek the good of souls from motives higher
8204,LXIII.,Than worldly gain. He trusted his desire
8205,LXIII.,Was that the Gospel might be free to all.
8206,LXIII.,"What Christ had done for him his zeal would fire,"
8207,LXIII.,And make him earnest in the sinner's call;
8208,LXIII.,Thus gladly would he forward press toward the goal.
8209,LXIII.,
8210,LXIV.,LXIV.
8211,LXIV.,
8212,LXIV.,Now let not Christians who from him may differ
8213,LXIV.,Suppose this man could no forbearance show.
8214,LXIV.,It was his wish to be in nothing stiffer
8215,LXIV.,"Than Truth required, which God led him to know."
8216,LXIV.,"From human creeds his conscience said ""withdraw!"""
8217,LXIV.,To stand by such advice he was content.
8218,LXIV.,"To Pharisaic pride he was a foe,"
8219,LXIV.,"And to ungodliness where'er he went,"
8220,LXIV.,While to promote true Love his gifts and time were spent.
8221,LXIV.,
8222,LXV.,LXV.
8223,LXV.,
8224,LXV.,"My Muse again of temporal-things would sing,"
8225,LXV.,And I her mandate hasten to obey.
8226,LXV.,"Upon all farms there's work enough in Spring,"
8227,LXV.,And GOODWORTH'S people were not used to play.
8228,LXV.,"'Tis true their farm was small, yet day by day"
8229,LXV.,They plenty found to occupy their time;
8230,LXV.,That patch of ground the labor would repay.
8231,LXV.,"As for good crops, 'twas in condition prime:"
8232,LXV.,Such they all hoped to raise in that fine fruitful clime.
8233,LXV.,
8234,LXVI.,LXVI.
8235,LXVI.,
8236,LXVI.,_Six_ acres still lay right behind the _two_;
8237,LXVI.,Doubtless it had an Indian clearance been.
8238,LXVI.,"This needs not much to fit it for the plow,"
8239,LXVI.,"So they of brush and rubbish rid it clean,"
8240,LXVI.,And broke it up. Then a rail fence was seen
8241,LXVI.,Most speedily to compass it around.
8242,LXVI.,"Soon spring wheat sown was looking brightly green,"
8243,LXVI.,"While in the garden useful plants were found,"
8244,LXVI.,And these good prospects made the family's joys abound.
8245,LXVI.,
8246,LXVII.,LXVII.
8247,LXVII.,
8248,LXVII.,"Their live stock was not large, yet they possessed"
8249,LXVII.,"Two milking cows, and yoke of oxen strong,"
8250,LXVII.,"Some turkeys, hogs, and poultry of the best."
8251,LXVII.,These all were bought ere they had been there long.
8252,LXVII.,For finest fish they could not well go wrong;
8253,LXVII.,The lake supplied all that they wished to get.
8254,LXVII.,In small canoe they often sailed along
8255,LXVII.,"The side of lovely isles and cast their net,"
8256,LXVII.,Or fished with line till glorious Sol had nearly set.
8257,LXVII.,
8258,LXVIII.,LXVIII.
8259,LXVIII.,
8260,LXVIII.,Sometimes a deer would venture near enough
8261,LXVIII.,"To run the risk of catching lumps of lead,"
8262,LXVIII.,And this well dressed was no unsavory stuff
8263,LXVIII.,With which to help a meal of wheaten bread.
8264,LXVIII.,"Of bears and wolves they were at first in dread,"
8265,LXVIII.,But soon found out there was no cause for fear;
8266,LXVIII.,"For if such came and mortal showed his head,"
8267,LXVIII.,"They soon ran off with a true coward's leer,"
8268,LXVIII.,Which made it seem surprising they should come so near.
8269,LXVIII.,
8270,LXIX.,LXIX.
8271,LXIX.,
8272,LXIX.,"To clear against the Fall, the sons marked out"
8273,LXIX.,Ten acres of the woods well filled with trees.
8274,LXIX.,"Such work required strong arms and courage stout,"
8275,LXIX.,And those young men could rightly boast of these.
8276,LXIX.,They now with willing hands their axes seize
8277,LXIX.,And push the work from early morn till night.
8278,LXIX.,"Loud sound the strokes, till each brave woodman sees"
8279,LXIX.,"The trees begin to tremble in their sight,"
8280,LXIX.,And soon with thundering sound upon the ground alight.
8281,LXIX.,
8282,LXX.,LXX.
8283,LXX.,
8284,LXX.,The chopper's life is not a life of ease--
8285,LXX.,And yet to those who understand it well
8286,LXX.,There's much about it that doth tend to please
8287,LXX.,"Their warm, strong minds, as they such monsters fell."
8288,LXX.,"I have oft stood as if bound by a spell,"
8289,LXX.,"When some huge giant swayed awhile in air,"
8290,LXX.,"And then with crash tremendous shook the dell,"
8291,LXX.,"While cows from fright would scamper here and there,"
8292,LXX.,But soon return to browse its top for lack of fare.
8293,LXX.,
8294,LXXI.,LXXI.
8295,LXXI.,
8296,LXXI.,While those in woods were busily employed
8297,LXXI.,"Swinging their axes in true workman style,"
8298,LXXI.,Their sisters neatly dressed as much enjoyed
8299,LXXI.,"The garden work, quite cheered by Nature's smile."
8300,LXXI.,"Lightening their labor with sweet songs the while,"
8301,LXXI.,They trained the different plants with skillful hands;
8302,LXXI.,A pleasing task well fitted to beguile
8303,LXXI.,"Such modest, gentle girls, who in Love's bands"
8304,LXXI.,"Were bound together, thus obeying God's commands."
8305,LXXI.,
8306,LXXII.,LXXII.
8307,LXXII.,
8308,LXXII.,Their gardener skill was not alone confined
8309,LXXII.,To what was wanted for their bodily needs.
8310,LXXII.,"By nature taught, each had a tasteful mind,"
8311,LXXII.,And this was shown by planting flower seeds.
8312,LXXII.,"These by some folks are looked upon as weeds,"
8313,LXXII.,And therefore useless--not e'en worth a straw!
8314,LXXII.,From such coarse souls I do not look for deeds
8315,LXXII.,"Which, in sweet aspect, do our nature show;"
8316,LXXII.,I envy not their taste nor all they chance to know.
8317,LXXII.,
8318,LXXIII.,LXXIII.
8319,LXXIII.,
8320,LXXIII.,I love to look on flowers. They to my soul
8321,LXXIII.,Sincerest pleasure and sweet peace still bring;
8322,LXXIII.,Their varied charms can wondrously control
8323,LXXIII.,My troubled spirit--smarting from the sting
8324,LXXIII.,"Of cold neglect and sad, crushed hopes, whence spring"
8325,LXXIII.,Many sore trials to the sons of men.
8326,LXXIII.,"I, midst my flowers, can feel myself a king,"
8327,LXXIII.,"Nor envy much the rich and mighty then,"
8328,LXXIII.,"With all their pomp and pride, or gorgeous trappings vain."
8329,LXXIII.,
8330,LXXIV.,LXXIV.
8331,LXXIV.,
8332,LXXIV.,And those fair damsels always loved to view
8333,LXXIV.,"Sweet tulips, pinks, and daisies' charms unfold,"
8334,LXXIV.,"The peony's blush, the lovely rose's hue,"
8335,LXXIV.,And woodbine's blossoms--lilies like pure gold.
8336,LXXIV.,"All these, and more, were pleasant to behold,"
8337,LXXIV.,And well repaid them for their frequent toil.
8338,LXXIV.,"Their plants throve well in that rich, deep, black mold,"
8339,LXXIV.,"And though the work did their nice fingers soil,"
8340,LXXIV.,It kept them ever free from this poor world's turmoil.
8341,LXXIV.,
8342,LXXV.,LXXV.
8343,LXXV.,
8344,LXXV.,The settlers round beheld with much surprise
8345,LXXV.,"The neat-kept garden in such beauty seen,"
8346,LXXV.,And oft they looked with rather longing eyes
8347,LXXV.,Upon the flowers bedecked in glorious sheen.
8348,LXXV.,Sometimes a youth upon the fence would lean
8349,LXXV.,And Watch with due respect the sisters fair;
8350,LXXV.,"Then anxious ask what this and that could mean,"
8351,LXXV.,Or names of plants which seemed to him so rare.
8352,LXXV.,Doubtless it was to see the maidens he came there.
8353,LXXV.,
8354,LXXVI.,LXXVI.
8355,LXXVI.,
8356,LXXVI.,Of this I could not speak with certainty;
8357,LXXVI.,"But mutual blushes, looks significant,"
8358,LXXVI.,Are very apt to tell strange tales to me.
8359,LXXVI.,"I once was young, so you will therefore grant"
8360,LXXVI.,I should know something of what youths still want
8361,LXXVI.,"When they to such sweet girls quite bashful come,"
8362,LXXVI.,And utter words as if their stock was scant.
8363,LXXVI.,"Well, 'tis but natural, and I would be mum;"
8364,LXXVI.,Of bliss thus sought and gained 'twere hard to tell the sum.
8365,LXXVI.,
8366,LXXVII.,LXXVII.
8367,LXXVII.,
8368,LXXVII.,"Often the parents, in their Master's spirit,"
8369,LXXVII.,Would link-armed take a pleasant walk at eve
8370,LXXVII.,"To visit neighbors, and thus seek to merit"
8371,LXXVII.,That just reward which faithful Saints receive
8372,LXXVII.,"From Jesus Christ, who never will deceive"
8373,LXXVII.,Those working well for him. They therefore went
8374,LXXVII.,"Gladly each burdened conscience to relieve,"
8375,LXXVII.,"And those assist who were by sickness spent,"
8376,LXXVII.,"Or tell to all, the message which their God had sent."
8377,LXXVII.,
8378,LXXVIII.,LXXVIII.
8379,LXXVIII.,
8380,LXXVIII.,On one of these occasions they became
8381,LXXVIII.,Acquainted with a youth to bed confined.
8382,LXXVIII.,"From early childhood he was always lame,"
8383,LXXVIII.,And for a year or two had been quite blind.
8384,LXXVIII.,"His manners were most gentle, and his mind"
8385,LXXVIII.,With human knowledge seemed to be well stored.
8386,LXXVIII.,"Now these dear people made enquiry kind,"
8387,LXXVIII.,"If he had in affliction sought the Lord,"
8388,LXXVIII.,Or ever gained true comfort from his Sacred Word.
8389,LXXVIII.,
8390,LXXIX.,LXXIX.
8391,LXXIX.,
8392,LXXIX.,"To them at first he no reply would give,"
8393,LXXIX.,"Yet seemed absorbed in thought, and heaved a sigh."
8394,LXXIX.,"At last he said, ""I always aimed to live"
8395,LXXIX.,So that I need not fear when brought to die.
8396,LXXIX.,I feel at present that my end is nigh
8397,LXXIX.,"And should not care ev'n now, if I were dead."
8398,LXXIX.,"Upon my blameless life I can rely,"
8399,LXXIX.,Nor look for harm to fall on guiltless head.
8400,LXXIX.,"A purer life than mine no mortal ever led."""
8401,LXXIX.,
8402,LXXX.,LXXX.
8403,LXXX.,
8404,LXXX.,"""My dear young friend,"" the Pastor sweetly said,"
8405,LXXX.,"""Did your own conscience never whisper you"
8406,LXXX.,That hope like this to ruin always led?
8407,LXXX.,"If not, let me now tell you it is true!"
8408,LXXX.,For none may hope the face of God to view
8409,LXXX.,In peace unless their sins are washed away
8410,LXXX.,By Jesus' blood. Our dearest Savior flew
8411,LXXX.,"On wings of Mercy man's worst foes to slay,"
8412,LXXX.,"And open wide the gates, to everlasting day!"""
8413,LXXX.,
8414,LXXXI.,LXXXI.
8415,LXXXI.,
8416,LXXXI.,He asked him then if he might read aloud
8417,LXXXI.,"A portion of God's Word, and offer prayer."
8418,LXXXI.,"The youth consented, feeling much less proud"
8419,LXXXI.,Than when these Christians first had entered there.
8420,LXXXI.,"GOODWORTH three chapters read with greatest care,"
8421,LXXXI.,"Three which at length dwell on the sinner's state,"
8422,LXXXI.,And then by plainest speech made him aware
8423,LXXXI.,"How he might best escape a sin-cursed fate,"
8424,LXXXI.,"Be reconciled to God, and coming Glory wait."
8425,LXXXI.,
8426,LXXXI.,"[Footnote: The 3d, 4th, and 5th chapters of Romans]"
8427,LXXXI.,
8428,LXXXII.,LXXXII.
8429,LXXXII.,
8430,LXXXII.,The poor blind lad had never heard before
8431,LXXXII.,"The wonders which those chapters do reveal,"
8432,LXXXII.,"Self-righteousness he ne'er could think of more,"
8433,LXXXII.,For sense of guilt he now began to feel.
8434,LXXXII.,"This roused up fears he could not well conceal,"
8435,LXXXII.,And made him anxious those two friends should pray.
8436,LXXXII.,"The Pastor made to him one more appeal,"
8437,LXXXII.,Then supplicated God without delay
8438,LXXXII.,That Grace might be shed forth to lead him in the way.
8439,LXXXII.,
8440,LXXXIII.,LXXXIII.
8441,LXXXIII.,
8442,LXXXIII.,"Now bitter tears flow from those sightless orbs,"
8443,LXXXIII.,"As light breaks in upon his darker soul,"
8444,LXXXIII.,"Prospect of death his wretched thoughts absorbs,"
8445,LXXXIII.,"And makes him wish that he could back recall,"
8446,LXXXIII.,"Those early years which did so fleetly roll,"
8447,LXXXIII.,Before he lost his health and precious sight;
8448,LXXXIII.,"For no dread visions then did him appal,"
8449,LXXXIII.,Nor was he wont to tremble from affright.
8450,LXXXIII.,"Oh, that he had but sought Salvation with his might!"
8451,LXXXIII.,
8452,LXXXIV.,LXXXIV.
8453,LXXXIV.,
8454,LXXXIV.,Our two friends told him plain 'twas not too late;
8455,LXXXIV.,"Such burdened souls the Savior had invited,"
8456,LXXXIV.,"However black their crimes, however great"
8457,LXXXIV.,Their mad rebellion; even if they had slighted
8458,LXXXIV.,This Means of Grace--without which man is benighted--
8459,LXXXIV.,He bids them come to him and find sweet rest.
8460,LXXXIV.,Those who have thus obeyed have been delighted
8461,LXXXIV.,"With his light yoke, and often have expressed"
8462,LXXXIV.,"Their sense of such great goodness, feeling truly blest."
8463,LXXXIV.,
8464,LXXXV.,LXXXV.
8465,LXXXV.,
8466,LXXXV.,"This good instruction had the best effect,"
8467,LXXXV.,And as he seemed composed the friends prepare
8468,LXXXV.,"To start for home, nor in the least suspect"
8469,LXXXV.,How quick the time had fled whilst they were there.
8470,LXXXV.,"They bade ""good night"" and left him in the care"
8471,LXXXV.,"Of their Kind Father, who had bid them go;"
8472,LXXXV.,And in their journey through the woods they share
8473,LXXXV.,"Sweet converse and true joy in constant flow,"
8474,LXXXV.,And reach their neat log house Content afresh to know.
8475,LXXXV.,
8476,LXXXVI.,LXXXVI.
8477,LXXXVI.,
8478,LXXXVI.,The sons and daughters greeted their return
8479,LXXXVI.,"With pleasant smiles, then with respect enquired"
8480,LXXXVI.,"What led to their detention, and now burn"
8481,LXXXVI.,To know the cause they look so sad and tired.
8482,LXXXVI.,"The parents, nothing both, gave as desired"
8483,LXXXVI.,A brief account how they had been employed;
8484,LXXXVI.,And this once more full confidence inspired
8485,LXXXVI.,"While each the truly pleasing thought enjoyed,"
8486,LXXXVI.,That one soul less would be by Satan's power destroyed.
8487,LXXXVI.,
8488,LXXXVII.,LXXXVII.
8489,LXXXVII.,
8490,LXXXVII.,Around the family Altar next they meet
8491,LXXXVII.,"To worship God by reading, prayer and praise,"
8492,LXXXVII.,Which all ascend like richest incense sweet
8493,LXXXVII.,Before the throne of Him who guides their ways.
8494,LXXXVII.,Surely bright Angels might delight to gaze
8495,LXXXVII.,"Upon this happy family at such time,"
8496,LXXXVII.,And feel those Christians fit to join in lays
8497,LXXXVII.,That they are wont to sing in heavenly clime;
8498,LXXXVII.,In rapturous devotion to their King sublime.
8499,LXXXVII.,
8500,LXXXVIII.,LXXXVIII.
8501,LXXXVIII.,
8502,LXXXVIII.,"If e'er a glimpse of heaven is had below,"
8503,LXXXVIII.,"If there is aught of Bliss upon this Earth,"
8504,LXXXVIII.,"A family like this it best can show,"
8505,LXXXVIII.,For they need not the worldling's boisterous mirth;
8506,LXXXVIII.,And yet of social feeling there's no dearth.
8507,LXXXVIII.,"Each does enjoy true peace and happiness,"
8508,LXXXVIII.,"Which, rightly valued, in their turn give birth"
8509,LXXXVIII.,"To noble deeds designed mankind to bless,"
8510,LXXXVIII.,"To strengthen what is right, and what is wrong redress."
8511,LXXXVIII.,
8512,LXXXIX.,LXXXIX.
8513,LXXXIX.,
8514,LXXXIX.,"I would not undervalue Church connection,"
8515,LXXXIX.,"For 'tis of God's appointment, and should show"
8516,LXXXIX.,"True Christian principles in much perfection,"
8517,LXXXIX.,And be the sweetest bond of all below.
8518,LXXXIX.,"But oh, it happens, I too truly know,"
8519,LXXXIX.,"There is mixed with it so much worldliness,"
8520,LXXXIX.,"So man members to vile Mammon bow,"
8521,LXXXIX.,"That my poor soul is filled with sore distress,"
8522,LXXXIX.,And scarce dare hope the Lord will such connection bless.
8523,LXXXIX.,
8524,XC.,XC.
8525,XC.,
8526,XC.,Under these circumstances I with others
8527,XC.,"Await most anxiously that day's appearing,"
8528,XC.,When Jesus Christ will with his chosen brothers
8529,XC.,Dwell in sweet fellowship and love endearing.
8530,XC.,The hope of this should always be most cheering
8531,XC.,To every Christian of each state and name;
8532,XC.,And make them patient hear with the rude jeering
8533,XC.,Of those who love to glory in their shame;
8534,XC.,Who for their soul's perdition are alone to blame.
8535,XC.,
8536,XCI.,XCI.
8537,XCI.,
8538,XCI.,"This hope was dear indeed to GOODWORTH'S heart,"
8539,XCI.,And made him feel a very strong desire
8540,XCI.,"Right Knowledge on all subjects to impart,"
8541,XCI.,And use but proper means true zeal to fire.
8542,XCI.,He wished not that his hearers should admire
8543,XCI.,"His humble teaching, but the truths he taught,"
8544,XCI.,And tried to show them how they could acquire
8545,XCI.,The power to judge all subjects which were brought
8546,XCI.,"Before their minds, as they with good or ill were fraught."
8547,XCI.,
8548,XCII.,XCII.
8549,XCII.,
8550,XCII.,Under such teaching this small Church became
8551,XCII.,"An humble, cheerful, happy, loving Band."
8552,XCII.,"While they by industry their wild lands tame,"
8553,XCII.,They did not oft neglect to lend a hand
8554,XCII.,To him who thus on Scripture took his stand.
8555,XCII.,"Their conduct and profession both agree,"
8556,XCII.,And every instance of God's goodness fanned
8557,XCII.,"Love's flame, and made it burn more steadily;"
8558,XCII.,For which they praised the Lord with great sincerity.
8559,XCII.,
8560,XCIII.,XCIII.
8561,XCIII.,
8562,XCIII.,"Amongst their number there was poor McKan,"
8563,XCIII.,Weakly in body but yet firm in mind.
8564,XCIII.,His means were small when he at first began
8565,XCIII.,To clear as wild a bush farm as you'll find.
8566,XCIII.,"The neighbors round had all to him been kind,"
8567,XCIII.,Feeling much pity for his family;
8568,XCIII.,"For he, though toiling hard, had run behind"
8569,XCIII.,In payment for his lot and soon might be
8570,XCIII.,With those dependant on him brought to misery.
8571,XCIII.,
8572,XCIV.,XCIV.
8573,XCIV.,
8574,XCIV.,"While certain ruin stared him in the face,"
8575,XCIV.,He felt he'd rather die than beg from friends;
8576,XCIV.,And so prepared to sacrifice his place--
8577,XCIV.,Persuaded that the Lord would make amends.
8578,XCIV.,The Pastor hears his case and straight attends
8579,XCIV.,Upon him at his house with wish to know
8580,XCIV.,"The full particulars, and gladly lends"
8581,XCIV.,An ear attentive to his tale of woe;
8582,XCIV.,How the stern creditor would no more mercy show.
8583,XCIV.,
8584,XCV.,XCV.
8585,XCV.,
8586,XCV.,His case was not a solitary one.
8587,XCV.,"Too many find when they have toiled for years,"
8588,XCV.,That sweet Hope leaves them when their strength is gone;
8589,XCV.,"Which fills their future with alarming fears,"
8590,XCV.,And nothing for them but despair appears!
8591,XCV.,"O, why is this? Have they imprudent been?"
8592,XCV.,Or has great sickness sunk them in arrears?
8593,XCV.,Perhaps it may be these; and yet I ween
8594,XCV.,Another cause of trouble may be clearly seen.
8595,XCV.,
8596,XCVI.,XCVI.
8597,XCVI.,
8598,XCVI.,That cause is this: Our Government thought fit
8599,XCVI.,"To sell their land at far too high a rate,"
8600,XCVI.,And those who bought thought they could pay for it
8601,XCVI.,"Within the time, which would be something great."
8602,XCVI.,"If common-sense had chanced to bid them wait,"
8603,XCVI.,They mostly had an answer close at hand:
8604,XCVI.,"""Men whom they knew had bettered much their state"
8605,XCVI.,"By buying on long time that wild bush land,"
8606,XCVI.,"Ami now as able farmers 'mongst their fellows stand."""
8607,XCVI.,
8608,XCVII.,XCVII.
8609,XCVII.,
8610,XCVII.,By pinching work they raise the first installment
8611,XCVII.,"For lot on which the claim pre-emption right,"
8612,XCVII.,"And from that time they find complete enthralment,"
8613,XCVII.,As with Adversity they constant fight.
8614,XCVII.,Where's now the prospect which was once so bright?
8615,XCVII.,"""Not quite all gone,"" may some poor settler say."
8616,XCVII.,"But health is broken, and no more delight"
8617,XCVII.,"Fills their parental hearts from day to day,"
8618,XCVII.,"While each succeeding month adds something more to pay,"
8619,XCVII.,
8620,XCVIII.,XCVIII.
8621,XCVIII.,
8622,XCVIII.,Until at last the time allowed has fled.
8623,XCVIII.,"More time is granted, but alas, in vain!"
8624,XCVIII.,With aches and pains they now are nearly dead.
8625,XCVIII.,Such help as they require they can't obtain;
8626,XCVIII.,"And yet perhaps of fortune they complain,"
8627,XCVIII.,"Or blame the friends whose ""luck"" led them out there."
8628,XCVIII.,But from such course 'tis better to refrain;
8629,XCVIII.,"For, had they been still _servants_, with due care"
8630,XCVIII.,They might have bought good farms and had some cash to spare.
8631,XCVIII.,
8632,XCIX.,XCIX.
8633,XCIX.,
8634,XCIX.,"Just so it was with that poor Christian brother,"
8635,XCIX.,And this at once the Pastor clearly saw;
8636,XCIX.,"Yet had no wish in haste to judge another,"
8637,XCIX.,But felt inclined pure Charity to show.
8638,XCIX.,"Then, having learned all he now wished to know,"
8639,XCIX.,Home he returned and sought his Father's ear.
8640,XCIX.,"From his full heart strong supplications flow,"
8641,XCIX.,"Which cease not till he sees his duty clear,"
8642,XCIX.,And gains fresh help from God his brethren's hearts to cheer.
8643,XCIX.,
8644,C.,C.
8645,C.,
8646,C.,"He next the matter told to his dear wife,"
8647,C.,For she was wise and often could suggest
8648,C.,"What was most useful in affairs of life,"
8649,C.,Which made her counsel be in much request.
8650,C.,"Her mind to him she freely then expressed,"
8651,C.,And mentioned what she heard the day before--
8652,C.,"How brother Luth, who was of friends the best,"
8653,C.,Would take the farm and willingly give more
8654,C.,"Than would the Creditor, if they the land restore."
8655,C.,
8656,CI.,CI.
8657,CI.,
8658,CI.,"GOODWORTH heard this, then spoke to Luth alone--"
8659,CI.,"Told him quite plainly how the matter stood,"
8660,CI.,"Yet not in harsh, authoritative tone,"
8661,CI.,"But meekly, as more likely to do good."
8662,CI.,"By this he showed regard for brotherhood,"
8663,CI.,And led Luth candidly to speak his mind.
8664,CI.,"Then, as both felt in very kindly mood,"
8665,CI.,They deemed it best to try McKan to find
8666,CI.,And let him know what they in Christian love designed.
8667,CI.,
8668,CII.,CII.
8669,CII.,
8670,CII.,"They found him soon and Luth made his proposal,"
8671,CII.,Which filled the humble family with delight.
8672,CII.,The whole affair appeared as the disposal
8673,CII.,"Of their kind God, who always acted right."
8674,CII.,Most thankful were they that in His pure sight
8675,CII.,They found such favor in their hour of need.
8676,CII.,That brother's kindness they could ne'er requite;
8677,CII.,"His was a noble--a most generous deed,"
8678,CII.,Which could alone from love at any time proceed.
8679,CII.,
8680,CIII.,CIII.
8681,CIII.,
8682,CIII.,"Luth took the place, and for improvements paid"
8683,CIII.,Beside what to the Creditor was due;
8684,CIII.,"""And if the family chose, they might,"" he said,"
8685,CIII.,"""Remain his tenants for a year or two,"
8686,CIII.,And daily labor he would take in lieu
8687,CIII.,"Of money payments for a moderate rent."""
8688,CIII.,"This plan aroused their gratitude anew,"
8689,CIII.,"While with the bargain all appeared content,"
8690,CIII.,And deemed the time employed most profitably spent.
8691,CIII.,
8692,CIV.,CIV.
8693,CIV.,
8694,CIV.,The two on their return called in to see
8695,CIV.,"The sick blind youth, who now was sinking fast."
8696,CIV.,"He was no longer in despondency,"
8697,CIV.,Though he of late had through great suffering passed.
8698,CIV.,"On the Atonement all his hopes were cast,"
8699,CIV.,And now enjoyed a happy frame of mind.
8700,CIV.,"The work of Jesus did appear so vast,"
8701,CIV.,He could not doubt but it had been designed
8702,CIV.,"By Him whose name is Love, to save poor lost mankind."
8703,CIV.,
8704,CV.,CV.
8705,CV.,
8706,CV.,The parents had beheld the change thus wrought
8707,CV.,"By Gospel Truth in their afflicted boy,"
8708,CV.,And called to mind how often they had thought
8709,CV.,Religion was invented to destroy
8710,CV.,Whatever mortals have of peace and joy.
8711,CV.,"""But now,"" they said, ""we think it something worth."
8712,CV.,"For our son's happiness has no alloy,"
8713,CV.,"Although about to leave the joys of Earth,"
8714,CV.,"And all those pleasant things which used to yield him mirth."""
8715,CV.,
8716,CVI.,CVI.
8717,CVI.,
8718,CVI.,"The Pastor now gave each an exhortation,"
8719,CVI.,"And kind friend Luth engaged awhile in prayer,"
8720,CVI.,"Which met, at present, no disapprobation."
8721,CVI.,"Much death bed comfort does the sick one share,"
8722,CVI.,"But soon his eyes assume a brighter glare,"
8723,CVI.,The rattle in his throat bespeaks death near.
8724,CVI.,"Anon they raise the dying youth with care,"
8725,CVI.,"Whose smiling face shows plain he has no fear,"
8726,CVI.,For Jesus in the valley does his servant cheer.
8727,CVI.,
8728,CVII.,CVII.
8729,CVII.,
8730,CVII.,"A strong, brief struggle, and now all is o'er!"
8731,CVII.,No more the heart will in his bosom beat.
8732,CVII.,"His soul triumphant gains Heaven's peaceful shore,"
8733,CVII.,And raptured stands to view each scene so sweet;
8734,CVII.,"Then joins the thousands tasting Bliss complete,"
8735,CVII.,In all the Hallelujahs which they raise
8736,CVII.,"Unto the Lamb of God, while at His feet"
8737,CVII.,They cast their crowns and ever wondering gaze
8738,CVII.,On Him who sits enthroned as worthy of all praise.
8739,CVII.,
8740,CVIII.,CVIII.
8741,CVIII.,
8742,CVIII.,Our friends strove now to cheer the drooping hearts
8743,CVIII.,Of that lone couple in their deep distress;
8744,CVIII.,For they knew well each promise which imparts
8745,CVIII.,To mourners hope and heartfelt happiness.
8746,CVIII.,These on their minds they forcibly impress;
8747,CVIII.,"And their kind efforts are not used in vain,"
8748,CVIII.,For the bereaved ones readily confess
8749,CVIII.,That faith in Jesus brought substantial gain
8750,CVIII.,To their dear boy who now is free from grief and pain.

8752,CIX.,CIX.

8756,CIX.,"With solemn mien and truly kind intent,"
8757,CIX.,The old folks' ardent sorrow to assuage.
8758,CIX.,"Some one prepares the needful shroud to wage,"
8759,CIX.,"While others wash and lay the body out,"
8760,CIX.,"And in soft tones make observations sage,"
8761,CIX.,"The truth of which none are inclined to doubt,"

8768,CX.,The news they take their families receive
8769,CX.,"As fresh inducement on their God to wait,"
8770,CX.,And ever watch by Wisdom's sacred gate.
8771,CX.,"Two days elapse and bring the Sabbath round,"

8778,CXI.,"Those simple, mournful rites do much impress"

8787,CXI.,
8788,CXII.,CXII.
8789,CXII.,
8790,CXII.,The text [Footnote: The three last verses of Matthew XI.] was one
8791,CXII.,that wonderfully stated
8792,CXII.,"The sinner groaning under loads of guilt,"
8793,CXII.,"And mourning souls have found weak faith recreated,"
8794,CXII.,As on its consolations they have built
8795,CXII.,"Their stable hopes, against which Hell full tilt"

8807,CXIII.,"Fit for the work, of Angels there is none."

8818,CXIV.,On each new view of Christ's great Sacrifice.
8819,CXIV.,"Now might be seen joy beaming in their eyes,"

8821,CXIV.,"Most precious promises the word supplies,"

8831,CXV.,"They never had before beheld Truth's blaze,"
8832,CXV.,"But, like too many, boasted of their state,"
8833,CXV.,Not dreaming that their light was lost in haze

8837,CXVI.,CXVI.
8838,CXVI.,
8839,CXVI.,'Tis thus the Lord oft makes most lasting good
8840,CXVI.,To flow from what we mortals view as ill;
8841,CXVI.,And we pass through each strange vicissitude
8842,CXVI.,To find that peace again our souls can fill;
8843,CXVI.,"While Mercy's shed, not like a trickling rill,"
8844,CXVI.,"But in full streams, with never ceasing flow--"
8845,CXVI.,"Softening our hearts obdurate, and our will"

8866,CXVIII.,A thing of which they all should be aware;

8869,CXVIII.,"Now, by contrivance, they enjoy a share"

8902,CXXI.,Where they might rest and eat in privacy.
8903,CXXI.,On choice of this they every one agree;

8907,CXXI.,A truly pleasant service that much blessing brings.
8908,CXXI.,
8909,CXXII.,CXXII.
8910,CXXII.,
8911,CXXII.,Young GOODWORTH'S then good poetry recited;
8912,CXXII.,"""Hymn to Mont Blanc,"" and GRAVES' sweet ""Elegy;"""
8913,CXXII.,"While MILTON'S lofty strains each one delighted,"
8914,CXXII.,And COWPER'S sketches-full of harmony.
8915,CXXII.,"CAMPBELL and WORDSWORTH yield variety,"
8916,CXXII.,And BURNS his quota furnished with the rest.
8917,CXXII.,"WILSON'S good Dramas, too, were deemed to be,"
8918,CXXII.,"By all the company, among the best:"
8919,CXXII.,And I would find no fault with what was then expressed.
8920,CXXII.,
8921,CXXIII.,CXXIII.
8922,CXXIII.,
8923,CXXIII.,"For lengthening out the pleasure thus obtained,"
8924,CXXIII.,The Pastor undertook to criticise
8925,CXXIII.,"Those pieces heard, and what was dark explained."
8926,CXXIII.,"Next, needful illustration he supplies,"
8927,CXXIII.,Or shows defects not seen by common eyes.
8928,CXXIII.,"Comparing the best with sacred poetry,"
8929,CXXIII.,He unfolds beauties in the Prophecies
8930,CXXIII.,"Of great Isaiah, and quite readily"
8931,CXXIII.,Paints in most glowing terms the Psalmist's minstrelsy!
8932,CXXIII.,
8933,CXXIV.,CXXIV.
8934,CXXIV.,
8935,CXXIV.,Then speaks of Jeremiah's plaintive strain--
8936,CXXIV.,"The ""Weeping Prophet"" and true Patriot,"
8937,CXXIV.,"Who often wept for Zion, and felt pain"
8938,CXXIV.,"For her great sins; who, when God's wrath waxed hot"
8939,CXXIV.,"Against his country, ne'er her weal forgot,"
8940,CXXIV.,"But prayed and wrestled with the Lord of Hosts,"
8941,CXXIV.,"If, peradventure, he her crimes would blot"
8942,CXXIV.,From out his Book; and yet he never boasts
8943,CXXIV.,"Of love to country, as some do who seek high posts."
8944,CXXIV.,
8945,CXXV.,CXXV.
8946,CXXV.,
8947,CXXV.,The book of Job--great in poetic lore--
8948,CXXV.,"He dwells upon, till wonder and delight"
8949,CXXV.,Seize all his hearers; most of whom before
8950,CXXV.,Had not enjoyed a very clear insight
8951,CXXV.,"Into that Book, which tells of God's great might,"
8952,CXXV.,"His wisdom, goodness and forbearance long"
8953,CXXV.,"With his poor servant, brought to saddest plight"
8954,CXXV.,Through Satan's eagerness to drive him wrong;
8955,CXXV.,When he poured forth his woes in deep impassioned song.
8956,CXXV.,
8957,CXXVI.,CXXVI.
8958,CXXVI.,
8959,CXXVI.,Next glanced at Moses' song on Red Sea shore--
8960,CXXVI.,When Pharaoh and his mighty host were drowned--
8961,CXXVI.,In which the Tribes most gratefully adore
8962,CXXVI.,"Their great Deliverer, who on Egypt frowned."
8963,CXXVI.,No mortal uninspired could e'er have found
8964,CXXVI.,"Such fitting language for that great event,"
8965,CXXVI.,"Those strains sublime, with glorious grandeur crowned,"
8966,CXXVI.,"Came forth from heaven, and back were thither sent"
8967,CXXVI.,"As worship to the Lord, from hearts, on praise intent."
8968,CXXVI.,
8969,CXXVII.,CXXVII.
8970,CXXVII.,
8971,CXXVII.,'Twas now full time that they should all partake
8972,CXXVII.,Of the refreshment thither brought with care.
8973,CXXVII.,"While thirst was quenched with water from the lake,"
8974,CXXVII.,They each with each their choicest viands share.
8975,CXXVII.,"But ere they eat of that most ample fate,"
8976,CXXVII.,Due thanks are given in a proper song.
8977,CXXVII.,"Such happy lot with any can compare,"
8978,CXXVII.,"So none need marvel if they tarried long,"
8979,CXXVII.,For everything conspired to make Love's bonds quite strong.
8980,CXXVII.,
8981,CXXVIII.,CXXVIII.
8982,CXXVIII.,
8983,CXXVIII.,The dinner o'er the older ones retired
8984,CXXVIII.,To give the Island a complete survey.
8985,CXXVIII.,In doing this they very much admired
8986,CXXVIII.,Sweet scenes thus visited on that fine day.
8987,CXXVIII.,"The younger part had no desire to stray,"
8988,CXXVIII.,"So they remained in that nice shady nook,"
8989,CXXVIII.,"And joined together in a harmless play,"
8990,CXXVIII.,"Or read awhile in some delightful book,"
8991,CXXVIII.,And thus of purest pleasure old and young partook.
8992,CXXVIII.,
8993,CXXIX.,CXXIX.
8994,CXXIX.,
8995,CXXIX.,"The sun, quite fast into the West descending,"
8996,CXXIX.,Now warned them all it was full time to go
8997,CXXIX.,"To their dear homes, where sweetest comforts blending,"
8998,CXXIX.,Gave no just cause neglect of them to show.
8999,CXXIX.,"But yet their hearts, with gratitude aglow,"
9000,CXXIX.,Prompt them once more to join in praise each voice
9001,CXXIX.,And now the Pastor sought from them to know
9002,CXXIX.,"If they of proper hymn have made their choice,"
9003,CXXIX.,"As he had one composed, and truly would rejoice"
9004,CXXIX.,
9005,CXXX.,CXXX.
9006,CXXX.,
9007,CXXX.,If his attempt to speak the mind of all
9008,CXXX.,For this day's pleasure and substantial joy
9009,CXXX.,"Should meet, with approbation and recall"
9010,CXXX.,The hours so sweetly spent without alloy.
9011,CXXX.,"He spoke of this to them with manners coy,"
9012,CXXX.,Like one not used to boast what he had done.
9013,CXXX.,"""Perhaps,"" he said, ""They might their time employ"
9014,CXXX.,To more advantage if he ne'er begun
9015,CXXX.,"To give to them the Song which he in haste had spun."""

9055,CXXXI.,"To Duke Street tune were their fine voices strung,"

9065,CXXXII.,'Twas such that they could all have been contented

9068,CXXXII.,"This may seem, strange, but they with dread behold"

9142,I.,"Sometimes all smiles and sunshine; then alas,"
9143,I.,"Dark clouds hang o'er us, and God's help we crave."
9144,I.,"Weak in adversity--when prosperous brave,"
9145,I.,We often act a very foolish part;
9146,I.,Forsaking Mercies which our Father gave.

9150,II.,II.

9152,II.,"So I, who many times have sung; of duty,"

9154,II.,"God's chastening hand, until I see the beauty"
9155,II.,Of all His dealings with me for my weal.
9156,II.,And yet the hand that wounds is sure
9157,II.,The injured part; designing all in love;
9158,II.,And in such manner that He can't conceal

9166,III.,"Awhile my thoughts in easy measure ran,"
9167,III.,Which much beguiled an often saddened heart.
9168,III.,And made me lay my pleasing task aside.
9169,III.,"Now, as I write not for an earthly mart,"

9172,III.,
9173,IV.,IV.
9174,IV.,
9175,IV.,I feel a sacred pleasure warm my breast
9176,IV.,As I resume my simple tale of love:
9177,IV.,"A tale which is not in rich language dressed,"
9178,IV.,"I fain would look for help from God above,"
9179,IV.,To leave a record of my principles;
9180,IV.,"And seek the guidance of the Heavenly Dove,"
9181,IV.,"Whose influence the darkest doubt dispels,"
9182,IV.,And fills with purest peace the heart wherein he dwells.
9183,IV.,
9184,IV.,
9185,V.,V.
9186,V.,
9187,V.,This glorious truth was never more displayed
9188,V.,Than in dear GOODWORTH'S every day's employ;
9189,V.,"Or in the fields or in the woodland shade,"
9190,V.,His love of duty yielded constant joy;
9191,V.,Sweet Heaven-born Peace naught could in him destroy.
9192,V.,"For why? He had in God most steadfast trust,"
9193,V.,And things which do so many minds annoy
9194,V.,"Led him to curb all anger, pride and lust,"
9195,V.,While in each fresh distress he knew that God was just.
9196,V.,
9197,VI.,VI.
9198,VI.,
9199,VI.,He also knew that he is merciful
9200,VI.,And wish in all he does unto mankind.
9201,VI.,"If this we see not we are very dull,"
9202,VI.,And to our soul's best interests truly blind.
9203,VI.,This to perceive some minds are too refined
9204,VI.,By false philosophy and learning vain.
9205,VI.,No wonder then if they are left behind
9206,VI.,The humble child of God who with disdain
9207,VI.,Views all these worldly pleasures that he might obtain.
9208,VI.,
9209,VII.,VII.
9210,VII.,
9211,VII.,Just so with GOODWORTH; though he had in schools
9212,VII.,"Learned much of what is termed deep classic lore,"
9213,VII.,He quite preferred to train his life by rules
9214,VII.,Contained in Scripture; and it grieved him sore
9215,VII.,To see some Christians--this all should deplore--
9216,VII.,Neglect Christ's precepts to procure their ends.
9217,VII.,"But seeing this, he never once forbore"
9218,VII.,To speak plain truth and reap what oft attends
9219,VII.,An upright course--ev'n scorn; but this his walk commends.
9220,VII.,
9221,VIII.,VIII.
9222,VIII.,
9223,VIII.,In his snug home he evermore obtained
9224,VIII.,What flowed from love--a holy reverence.
9225,VIII.,Of harsh commands his children ne'er complained;
9226,VIII.,Wrangling and discord both were banished thence.
9227,VIII.,"His much loved wife possessed some rare good sense,"
9228,VIII.,And seconded his efforts for their good.
9229,VIII.,She never sought in earnest or pretence
9230,VIII.,To lower him before his flesh and blood;
9231,VIII.,While to increase their comforts she did all she could.
9232,VIII.,
9233,IX.,IX.
9234,IX.,
9235,IX.,Nor was it strange if such a home as this
9236,IX.,Made him content his leisure time to spend
9237,IX.,Within his family circle; for such bliss
9238,IX.,"Comes not to all, who seek to make an end"
9239,IX.,"Of troubles that a single life attend,"
9240,IX.,By entering soon into the marriage state.
9241,IX.,If such folks would but strict attention lend
9242,IX.,"To Bible teaching, they might share the fate"
9243,IX.,"Of these, our friends, on whom true pleasure seemed to wait."
9244,IX.,
9245,X.,X.
9246,X.,
9247,X.,Their constant mutual love became the theme
9248,X.,With all who knew them in that Settlement;
9249,X.,"Domestic bliss was proved no idle dream,"
9250,X.,For in true happiness their lives were spent.
9251,X.,"To labor hard they always were content,"
9252,X.,Regarding Paul's advice and his example:
9253,X.,It was their thought they were but thither sent
9254,X.,To furnish proof which all might own was ample
9255,X.,"That they loved Jesus' laws, on which too many trample."
9256,X.,
9257,XI.,XI.
9258,XI.,
9259,XI.,Let none imagine they e'er built on this
9260,XI.,A hope of endless happiness in heaven.
9261,XI.,They deemed it right all men should bow submiss
9262,XI.,"To His Authority, whose life was given"
9263,XI.,For sinners vile; that they might not be driven
9264,XI.,Away from Him to dwell in endless woe.
9265,XI.,This oft has cheered them on as they have striven
9266,XI.,To lead their fellow men God's truth to know;
9267,XI.,And every day its power did their behavior show.
9268,XI.,
9269,XII.,XII.
9270,XII.,
9271,XII.,The Spring is past and Summer's heat has fled.
9272,XII.,United diligence hath well supplied
9273,XII.,"A plenteous store of more than needful bread,"
9274,XII.,"For they have some choice luxuries beside,"
9275,XII.,By which means different tastes were gratified.
9276,XII.,"The snug ten acre field with wheat is sown,"
9277,XII.,And looks most promising. Should naught betide
9278,XII.,To hurt their present prospects this alone
9279,XII.,Will well repay them for the hardships they have known.
9280,XII.,
9281,XIII.,XIII.
9282,XIII.,
9283,XIII.,And now the necessary steps are taken
9284,XIII.,To shield the cattle from dread Winter's rage.
9285,XIII.,Necessity--stern master--does awaken
9286,XIII.,"Their full inventive powers, and they engage"
9287,XIII.,With ready ardor pens and sheds to wage;
9288,XIII.,"And in the absence of commodious barn,"
9289,XIII.,"They stack with care their straw, and thus are sage"
9290,XIII.,"Compared with many whom no dangers warn,"
9291,XIII.,"And who, though often suffering, will not stoop to learn."
9292,XIII.,
9293,XIV.,XIV.

9295,XIV.,"A good supply of hard wood they obtain,"
9296,XIV.,"To serve them through the season drawing near,"
9297,XIV.,"When rude King Frost will hold tyrranic reign,"
9298,XIV.,Making the country desolate and drear.
9299,XIV.,But in those woods they have small cause for fear
9300,XIV.,"From Winter's howling, fearful, bitter blasts,"
9301,XIV.,"For they have fuel in abundance near,"
9302,XIV.,And the huge wood file constant comfort casts
9303,XIV.,Into the snug log house long as the season lasts.
9304,XIV.,
9305,XV.,XV.
9306,XV.,
9307,XV.,"All these arrangements made, the Pastor felt"
9308,XV.,He had more leisure now to walk abroad;
9309,XV.,And in the gorgeous woods he often knelt
9310,XV.,"In fervent prayer before his Father, God."
9311,XV.,For miles around his feet have pressed the sod
9312,XV.,Which ne'er was turned by plow up to the sun--
9313,XV.,"Wilds that the foot of white man seldom trod,"
9314,XV.,And where no clearance had as yet begun:
9315,XV.,Where he could sit and watch some charming brooklet run.
9316,XV.,
9317,XVI.,XVI.
9318,XVI.,
9319,XVI.,Or now and then would wander near the side
9320,XVI.,"Of that majestic Lake, whose isles, tree clad"
9321,XVI.,"And decked in Autumn's tints, appeared to ride"
9322,XVI.,With all their splendors quite elate and glad
9323,XVI.,On Huron's silvery surface. Such scenes had
9324,XVI.,A powerful charm to one of GOODWORTH'S mind.
9325,XVI.,"They would indeed, if aught had made him sad,"
9326,XVI.,Often dispel his gloom and leave behind
9327,XVI.,Precious remembrances of an enduring kind.
9328,XVI.,
9329,XVII.,XVII.
9330,XVII.,
9331,XVII.,This was no marvel for his soul was filled
9332,XVII.,With true poetic fire; and oft sweet song
9333,XVII.,Of purest praise spontaneously has welled
9334,XVII.,From his enraptured heart. Then he would long
9335,XVII.,To leave a world where misery and wrong
9336,XVII.,"So much prevail, but yet content to stay"
9337,XVII.,"And sere his master, his poor saints among;"
9338,XVII.,"Would try to save those led from God astray,"
9339,XVII.,"That he might aid Christ's cause while it is called ""To-day."""
9340,XVII.,
9341,XVIII.,XVIII.
9342,XVIII.,
9343,XVIII.,Amidst such scenery he would sometimes take
9344,XVIII.,"In haste his pencil, that he might note down"
9345,XVIII.,Such thought as gushing from their fountain make
9346,XVIII.,The truest poetry that man has known.
9347,XVIII.,A specimen or two will now be shown
9348,XVIII.,Ere I proceed with my unlettered tale.
9349,XVIII.,If I mistake not they have all been drawn
9350,XVIII.,"From Nature's store, and if so should not fail"
9351,XVIII.,To claim our deep respect while they our minds regale.

9363,PASTOR'S AUTUMNAL SONG.,"It is sweet in our woods a free ranger to wander,"

9401,HIS SONG TO A RILL.,As I note thy varied charms
9402,HIS SONG TO A RILL.,"Dulcet sounds fall on my ear,"
9403,HIS SONG TO A RILL.,Soothing much a saddened heart;

9458,XX.,"And now the woods assume a darker brown,"
9459,XX.,While in the weather there is not a trace
9460,XX.,Of Summer's ardent heat that doth unbrace
9461,XX.,"The nerves of most, and makes one long to feel"
9462,XX.,The cooling breeze as Winter comes apace
9463,XX.,"To scatter forest leaves with savage zeal,"
9464,XX.,Which do the narrow wood-paths by their fall conceal.

9469,XXI.,Filling the creeks and swamps and rivers full;
9470,XXI.,"Or in the woods or in the growing town,"
9471,XXI.,Things wear an aspect truly dark and dull.
9472,XXI.,"Through deep, stiff mud the stoutest oxen pull"
9473,XXI.,With much ado the very smallest load;
9474,XXI.,While many a blow across his patient skull

9483,XXII.,One vast white sheet which screens the plants below
9484,XXII.,"From biting frosts, while easier to and fro"
9485,XXII.,The settlers move in their convenient sleighs.
9486,XXII.,These heed not cold if they have hearts aglow
9487,XXII.,"With friendly feelings, but will speed for days"
9488,XXII.,Along the snow-paved roads and on some strange highways.
9489,XXII.,
9490,XXIII.,XXIII.
9491,XXIII.,
9492,XXIII.,At such a time Goodworth and eldest son
9493,XXIII.,Left home and all its inmates in God's care;
9494,XXIII.,But ere they had their first day's journey done
9495,XXIII.,A circumstance occurred by no means rare.
9496,XXIII.,An English emigrant had settled where
9497,XXIII.,The woods were heavy and no neighbors near.
9498,XXIII.,He had partaken of the morning's fare
9499,XXIII.,And armed with axe dreamt not of cause for fear--
9500,XXIII.,Thought he'd be back at noon to wife and children dear.
9501,XXIII.,
9502,XXIV.,XXIV.
9503,XXIV.,
9504,XXIV.,But noontide came and brought no father fond
9505,XXIV.,To take his place and share the frugal meal.
9506,XXIV.,They little knew that his loved form beyond
9507,XXIV.,In that dark wood could no emotion feel.
9508,XXIV.,The loving wife could very ill conceal
9509,XXIV.,Dread thoughts which rose within her faithful breast.
9510,XXIV.,Should he be dead her own and children's weal
9511,XXIV.,"Were fled forever. So, with mind distressed"
9512,XXIV.,She went to search the woods and gave herself no rest.
9513,XXIV.,
9514,XXV.,XXV.
9515,XXV.,
9516,XXV.,At last she came to where a huge tree lay
9517,XXV.,Athwart the body of the hapless man.
9518,XXV.,"By grief distracted there she could not stay,"
9519,XXV.,But up the road with frightful speed she ran.
9520,XXV.,Soon she met Goodworths and forthwith began
9521,XXV.,To tell her tale most incoherently.
9522,XXV.,Few words were needful at such a time to fan
9523,XXV.,Love's flame in them or make them prove to be
9524,XXV.,Both Good Samaritans to that poor family.
9525,XXV.,
9526,XXVI.,XXVI.
9527,XXVI.,
9528,XXVI.,They took her up and tried to calm her mind
9529,XXVI.,Until they came to that soul-harrowing scene.
9530,XXVI.,"Now all alight; ere long the axe they find,"
9531,XXVI.,Which had so late the man's companion been.
9532,XXVI.,His stiffened corpse was wedged quite fast between
9533,XXVI.,"The tree and frozen earth, and naught remained"
9534,XXVI.,But first the widow with sleigh-robes to screen
9535,XXVI.,From bitter cold; and this point having gained
9536,XXVI.,"They soon cut through the tree, so well had they been trained."
9537,XXVI.,
9538,XXVII.,XXVII.
9539,XXVII.,
9540,XXVII.,It then became their melancholy duty
9541,XXVII.,To take the lifeless form from the sad spot.
9542,XXVII.,"And now the widow in sweet, mournful beauty"
9543,XXVII.,Directs the new-found friends to her log cot.
9544,XXVII.,A tearless eye within that home was not--
9545,XXVII.,All felt the dreadful nature of the loss
9546,XXVII.,"Which had that day occurred, for naught could blot"
9547,XXVII.,His great worth from their minds. He ne'er was cross
9548,XXVII.,To those who clung to him as to the tree the moss.
9549,XXVII.,
9550,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
9551,XXVIII.,
9552,XXVIII.,To leave this family in such piteous state
9553,XXVIII.,"Was out of question, so young GOODWORTH took"
9554,XXVIII.,The horses out--for now 'twas growing late--
9555,XXVIII.,"To quench their thirst at a clear purling brook,"
9556,XXVIII.,And gave them food within a sheltered nook;
9557,XXVIII.,Then found some boards and made a coffin rude.
9558,XXVIII.,Meanwhile the father took God's holy Book
9559,XXVIII.,And read such portions as teach fortitude
9560,XXVIII.,"To us, that all immoderate grief may be subdued."
9561,XXVIII.,
9562,XXIX.,XXIX.
9563,XXIX.,
9564,XXIX.,"'Twas well that mother long had known the Lord,"
9565,XXIX.,For wondrous strength is now to her imparted;
9566,XXIX.,And each clear promise in the Holy Word
9567,XXIX.,"Proved balm unto her soul, though much she smarted."
9568,XXIX.,"In both the GOODWORTHS she found friends warm hearted,"
9569,XXIX.,Friends who could give their love and sympathy;
9570,XXIX.,And ere they from her humble home departed
9571,XXIX.,They showed such proofs of generosity
9572,XXIX.,As did with their profession very well agree.
9573,XXIX.,
9574,XXX.,XXX.
9575,XXX.,
9576,XXX.,"For such a work by sad experience trained,"
9577,XXX.,They soon proceeded to lay out the dead;
9578,XXX.,And though fatigued they ne'er of it complained.
9579,XXX.,Nor would they let the widow spread a bed
9580,XXX.,"For their joint use, but sat and watched instead."
9581,XXX.,"_She_, much refreshed by prayer and conversation"
9582,XXX.,Retired to rest her weaned heart and head.
9583,XXX.,_They_ spent the night in solemn contemplation
9584,XXX.,Or read that precious Book which does unfold Salvation.
9585,XXX.,
9586,XXXI.,XXXI.
9587,XXXI.,
9588,XXXI.,"When morning came their plans were well matured,"
9589,XXXI.,And each went off to tell the mournful news.
9590,XXXI.,"Ere noon appeared assistance they secured,"
9591,XXXI.,For help at such time who can well refuse?
9592,XXXI.,"Some brought their tools which they knew how to use,"
9593,XXXI.,And dug a grave in the selected spot.
9594,XXXI.,"There round it grew no stately, somber yews,"
9595,XXXI.,But these and other things it needed not
9596,XXXI.,To be fit resting-place for one not soon forgot.
9597,XXXI.,
9598,XXXII.,XXXII.
9599,XXXII.,
9600,XXXII.,When all was ready GOODWORTH lent support
9601,XXXII.,To the bereaved one following the bier.
9602,XXXII.,In sweet-toned language he did her exhort
9603,XXXII.,"To look to Him who ""bottles up each tear"""
9604,XXXII.,His children shed while in deep sorrow here.
9605,XXXII.,"They reached the grave, where she with firmness stood"
9606,XXXII.,And felt such comfort as dispelled her fear.
9607,XXXII.,Such fruits spring from true Christian Brotherhood
9608,XXXII.,To all who rest their hopes on Christ's atoning blood.
9609,XXXII.,
9610,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
9611,XXXIII.,
9612,XXXIII.,"Due rites performed, the settlers flock around"
9613,XXXIII.,The widowed mother and warm offers make
9614,XXXIII.,"Of humble service, with respect profound."
9615,XXXIII.,"_This_ wished the boy and _that_ the girl to take,"
9616,XXXIII.,And treat them well for their dear parents' sake.
9617,XXXIII.,"She heard these offers with much thankfulness,"
9618,XXXIII.,But said to part with them her heart would break--
9619,XXXIII.,"Would miss them, too, in this her sad distress,"
9620,XXXIII.,And they could get along if God their efforts bless.
9621,XXXIII.,
9622,XXXIV,XXXIV
9623,XXXIV,
9624,XXXIV,That night the Pastor ventured to enquire
9625,XXXIV,What were her prospects? Did she money need?
9626,XXXIV,The answer made he could not but admire:
9627,XXXIV,"""Her God had ever proved a friend indeed;"
9628,XXXIV,"Cheered by His promises which she could plead,"
9629,XXXIV,"She doubted not He would them still protect,"
9630,XXXIV,"And, make their labors on the farm succeed;"
9631,XXXIV,"Her boy was strong, and had such great respect"
9632,XXXIV,"For what was right that he his work would not neglect."""
9633,XXXIV,
9634,XXXV.,XXXV.
9635,XXXV.,
9636,XXXV.,Next day the friends prepared again to start
9637,XXXV.,On their cold journey soon as it was light.
9638,XXXV.,Both urged their hostess freely to impart
9639,XXXV.,To them from time to time her prospects bright
9640,XXXV.,"Or the reverse, as she might deem it right."
9641,XXXV.,"In fervent prayer they her to God commend,"
9642,XXXV.,Then bade Farewell and soon were out of sight
9643,XXXV.,"They reached that day their lengthy journey's end,"
9644,XXXV.,And gained a hearty welcome from their loving friend.
9645,XXXV.,
9646,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
9647,XXXVI.,
9648,XXXVI.,That friend lived in a village destined soon
9649,XXXVI.,To show few traces of the times gone past
9650,XXXVI.,"When its fair site was woods where the racoon,"
9651,XXXVI.,"The bear, and wolf had munched their stolen repast."
9652,XXXVI.,"In wealth and people 'twas increasing fast,"
9653,XXXVI.,But not in morals--these were very low;
9654,XXXVI.,Yet some there lived who roused themselves at last
9655,XXXVI.,And with great vigor met the monster foe--
9656,XXXVI.,Ev'n vile Intemperance--to give him his death blow.
9657,XXXVI.,
9658,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
9659,XXXVII.,
9660,XXXVII.,This end they hoped for by the simple means
9661,XXXVII.,Of total abstinence from liquors strong.
9662,XXXVII.,The frequent use of these gives rise to scenes
9663,XXXVII.,Which all good men would scorn to be among.
9664,XXXVII.,"Vile oaths, the boisterous mirth, the wanton song,"
9665,XXXVII.,Were constant heard within each horrid den
9666,XXXVII.,Where these vile drinks were retailed all day long.
9667,XXXVII.,'Twas sad indeed to view such filthy pen
9668,XXXVII.,Filled with poor ruined wretches who once had been men.
9669,XXXVII.,
9670,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
9671,XXXVIII.,
9672,XXXVIII.,"Throughout the village there were many such,"
9673,XXXVIII.,And as a consequence great mischief done.
9674,XXXVIII.,It is surprising and has grieved me much
9675,XXXVIII.,To think our Magistrates have laurels won
9676,XXXVIII.,By doing what all devils view as fun!
9677,XXXVIII.,Why grant a license to each Groggery
9678,XXXVIII.,When it is evident men only run
9679,XXXVIII.,"To those low places for iniquity,"
9680,XXXVIII.,Till they become as vile as wicked men can be?
9681,XXXVIII.,
9682,XXXIX.,XXXIX.
9683,XXXIX.,
9684,XXXIX.,Our Pastor's friend was one among the number
9685,XXXIX.,That first came forward openly to stand
9686,XXXIX.,"On ""total Abstinence,"" nor did he slumber,"
9687,XXXIX.,But to the work lent willing heart and hand.
9688,XXXIX.,"GOODWORTH knew this, and having at command"
9689,XXXIX.,A little leisure held a meeting there.
9690,XXXIX.,"He spoke with warmth in language bold yet bland,"
9691,XXXIX.,Using such arguments as made men stare
9692,XXXIX.,"Who went for sake of fun, but got some better fare."
9693,XXXIX.,
9694,XL.,XL.
9695,XL.,
9696,XL.,With ready tact he showed the means insidious
9697,XL.,Used oft by those who sold the drunkard drink.
9698,XL.,"To lure him on by stimulants oblivious,"
9699,XL.,"Till he lost self-command, and ceased to think."
9700,XL.,Then showed him tottering on the fearful brink
9701,XL.,"Of the wide-opening grave and drunkard's hell,"
9702,XL.,And truthfully described how link by link
9703,XL.,"Of sacred ties were severed, as the spell"
9704,XL.,"Grew daily stronger, and a sot confirmed he fell."
9705,XL.,
9706,XLI.,XLI.
9707,XLI.,
9708,XLI.,"And now he drew as with a master's hand,"
9709,XLI.,A vivid picture of sad family woes;
9710,XLI.,The broken-hearted wife oft forced to stand
9711,XLI.,Betwixt her children and their father's blows--
9712,XLI.,"He mad with rum, thus trampling Nature's laws;"
9713,XLI.,Or gave a life-like sketch where parents vie
9714,XLI.,"In drunken riot, every day the cause"
9715,XLI.,"Of strife and discord, the poor home a sty"
9716,XLI.,"Where filth and rags surround them, till like beasts they die."
9717,XLI.,
9718,XLII.,XLII.
9719,XLII.,
9720,XLII.,And then he gave with most consummate skill
9721,XLII.,"A true description of Sobriety,"
9722,XLII.,Where man and wife walk up and down Life's hill
9723,XLII.,In sweet conjugal peace and piety;
9724,XLII.,"Their love increasing as more years they see,"
9725,XLII.,Their children growing up like olive plants
9726,XLII.,"To love and cherish much their memory,"
9727,XLII.,"And if need be in Age supply their wants,"
9728,XLII.,Then meet with that reward which God to such still grants.
9729,XLII.,
9730,XLIII.,XLIII.
9731,XLIII.,
9732,XLIII.,"While he was speaking there was some excitement,"
9733,XLIII.,And at the meeting's close a number came
9734,XLIII.,"To sign the Pledge, expressing much delightment."
9735,XLIII.,"Yet some were there who slunk away in shame,"
9736,XLIII.,Muttering that they were not a whit to blame
9737,XLIII.,"For the poor drunkard's fate, although they had"
9738,XLIII.,Used every means to keep alive the flame
9739,XLIII.,Which burned their vitals and made them quite mad.
9740,XLIII.,That these escape due punishment is far too bad.
9741,XLIII.,
9742,XLIV.,XLIV.
9743,XLIV.,
9744,XLIV.,I here would try to speak my mind in brief
9745,XLIV.,Upon the Temperance movement ere I pass
9746,XLIV.,"To other scenes, either of joy or grief,"
9747,XLIV.,"In which our Pastor figures--for alas,"
9748,XLIV.,"""Man's best laid schemes are only like to grass"
9749,XLIV.,"Which springs up for a season and then dies."""
9750,XLIV.,Just so this question 'mongst the world's great mass
9751,XLIV.,"Sometimes seems gaining ground, but the Foe plies"
9752,XLIV.,His sly ensnaring waits and all reform defies.
9753,XLIV.,
9754,XLIV.,
9755,XLV.,XLV.
9756,XLV.,
9757,XLV.,Now why is this? Can any tell me why?
9758,XLV.,Some feel quite sure all we now want's a law
9759,XLV.,To stop the godless traffic. These rely
9760,XLV.,Perhaps too much on man to strike the blow
9761,XLV.,Which is to bring the fell Destroyer low.
9762,XLV.,Others are sure that it is useless quite
9763,XLV.,To curb the monster. These ne'er felt the glow
9764,XLV.,Of pure Philanthropy move them aright
9765,XLV.,Or they would rise and aim to crush this demon's might.
9766,XLV.,
9767,XLVI.,XLVI.
9768,XLVI.,
9769,XLVI.,"Try this scheme, friends: Let all true Christians stand"
9770,XLVI.,"Fast in one body, and use fervent prayer"
9771,XLVI.,"And self-denial, that the Lord's right hand"
9772,XLVI.,May be stretched out to break each chain and snare
9773,XLVI.,Which binds mankind. Then let it be our care
9774,XLVI.,To act consistently in all we do.
9775,XLVI.,Of resting on an arm of flesh beware!
9776,XLVI.,For in this case our plans will all fall through;
9777,XLVI.,We shall be put to shame and feel deep anguish too.
9778,XLVI.,
9779,XLVII.,XLVII.
9780,XLVII.,
9781,XLVII.,May we no opportunity neglect
9782,XLVII.,Of spreading wide the Gospel's joyful sound
9783,XLVII.,For those who never do indeed expect
9784,XLVII.,That God's rich blessing will their steps surround.
9785,XLVII.,Thrice happy shall we be if we are found
9786,XLVII.,Engaged still thus when Jesus calls us hence.
9787,XLVII.,"Rise, Christians, then, and let your zeal abound!"
9788,XLVII.,The Savior calls! In earnest now commence
9789,XLVII.,"This Godlike work, and let his name be our defence."
9790,XLVII.,
9791,XLVIII.,XLVIII.
9792,XLVIII.,
9793,XLVIII.,"I now resume my simple narrative,"
9794,XLVIII.,To tell how GOODWORTHS reached their home again.
9795,XLVIII.,"More striking views of them I yet must give,"
9796,XLVIII.,If I may strike my harp and use my pen.
9797,XLVIII.,To me who rank not 'mongst well learned men
9798,XLVIII.,'Twill prove a task of no small magnitude;
9799,XLVIII.,"Yet after hard bench-labor, now and then"
9800,XLVIII.,It gives relief from much solicitude
9801,XLVIII.,To sit in my arm chair and form my verses rude.
9802,XLVIII.,
9803,XLIX.,XLIX.
9804,XLIX.,
9805,XLIX.,"Once more our friends are gliding o'er the road,"
9806,XLIX.,While their clear bells most lively music make.
9807,XLIX.,"The sleighing good, and past each log abode"
9808,XLIX.,They swiftly fly and soon a side-line take
9809,XLIX.,To gain an Indian village near the Lake.
9810,XLIX.,Here they intend to spend a little time
9811,XLIX.,The poor Red Men from sin and death to wake
9812,XLIX.,"By speaking to them of those Truths sublime,"
9813,XLIX.,Which can renew the souls of men sunk low in crime.
9814,XLIX.,
9815,L.,L.
9816,L.,
9817,L.,The Indian Chiefs received them with much pleasure;
9818,L.,They saw in GOODWORTH what did suit them well.
9819,L.,"Of outward charms he had an ample measure,"
9820,L.,And his fine voice was like a deep-toned bell.
9821,L.,These all combined cast as it were a spell
9822,L.,"Over those haughty rangers of the wood,"
9823,L.,And made them ponder what he had to tell.
9824,L.,It was a sight to see those natives rude
9825,L.,List to God's Gospel-message in a serious mood.
9826,L.,
9827,LI.,LI.
9828,LI.,
9829,LI.,"They listened, and the Holy Ghost with power"
9830,LI.,Sent home the word to some of savage heart.
9831,LI.,These since have seen great cause to bless the hour
9832,LI.,In which our Pastor visited that part.
9833,LI.,"A few, deep-skilled in blackest ""heathen art"""
9834,LI.,"Were full of rage and would have done him harm,"
9835,LI.,"But lacked the power, which but increased their smart."
9836,LI.,"Meanwhile the others with fresh feelings warm,"
9837,LI.,Pressed hospitable rites and quelled the fierce alarm.
9838,LI.,
9839,LII.,LII.
9840,LII.,
9841,LII.,With these he had some very earnest talk
9842,LII.,Of that obedience which the Lord requires
9843,LII.,"From his Disciples, to ensure a walk"
9844,LII.,Such as may tend to curb our vain desires
9845,LII.,And nurture that which to all good aspires.
9846,LII.,He deemed it proper not to press at first
9847,LII.,The rite Baptismal; and while one admires
9848,LII.,"His views on this, another seems to thirst"
9849,LII.,For full initiation lest he die accursed.
9850,LII.,
9851,LIII.,LIII.
9852,LIII.,
9853,LIII.,This from an Indian did excite surprise;
9854,LIII.,But soon 'twas known this man had heard before
9855,LIII.,A hint of it from some one he thought wise--
9856,LIII.,One truly skilled in strong Sectarian lore.
9857,LIII.,"To try to set him right Goodworth forbore,"
9858,LIII.,"At least at that time, as too well he knew"
9859,LIII.,Men oft in controversy feel more sore
9860,LIII.,On things of which they have but partial view;
9861,LIII.,That they will argue most for what to them is _new_.
9862,LIII.,
9863,LIV.,LIV.
9864,LIV.,
9865,LIV.,"Upon the morrow ere they took their leave,"
9866,LIV.,It was arranged--God willing--to return
9867,LIV.,Within a week or two those to receive
9868,LIV.,Into strict Fellowship who wished to learn
9869,LIV.,"God's will, which all in Scripture may discern,"
9870,LIV.,That in Church standing they a light might be
9871,LIV.,To their poor friends whose state required concern.
9872,LIV.,"This settled, GOODWORTHS then most cheerfully"
9873,LIV.,Resumed their journey home to join their family.
9874,LIV.,
9875,LV.,LV.
9876,LV.,
9877,LV.,"The first few miles in safety soon they passed,"
9878,LV.,And reach the edge of a most dismal swamp
9879,LV.,Stretched out before them in dimensions vast;
9880,LV.,A huge receptacle of gloom and damp.
9881,LV.,There savage wolves and beasts of such a stamp
9882,LV.,Might lodge secure and plan most daring deeds.
9883,LV.,"Gloomy the prospect, though the solar Lamp"
9884,LV.,"Was full two hours from setting, and the steeds"
9885,LV.,Restive become and faster fly as instinct leads.
9886,LV.,
9887,LVI.,LVI.
9888,LVI.,
9889,LVI.,"The men knew well what they had to expect,"
9890,LVI.,And sent a prayer into their Father's ear.
9891,LVI.,"This done, they did no proper means neglect"
9892,LVI.,"To meet what danger might be hovering near,"
9893,LVI.,And also strove each others' hearts to cheer.
9894,LVI.,Swifter the horses speed o'er the rough logs
9895,LVI.,"That form the road, and now some wolves appear"
9896,LVI.,"Hungry and fierce and fresh from noisome bogs,"
9897,LVI.,To pounce upon our friends who lack their faithful dogs.
9898,LVI.,
9899,LVII.,LVII.
9900,LVII.,
9901,LVII.,"The murderous gang now spring but miss their prey,"
9902,LVII.,And plunging in deep snow vent forth their rage
9903,LVII.,"In horrid yells, then strive to reach the sleigh."
9904,LVII.,Again they fail; again afresh engage
9905,LVII.,With double fury bloody war to wage!
9906,LVII.,Vain their attempts. A Mighty Hand unseen
9907,LVII.,"Aids those two men. This does their fears assuage,"
9908,LVII.,"And nerves their arms, and keeps their minds serene,"
9909,LVII.,Or they had failed to tell how good the Lord had been.
9910,LVII.,
9911,LVIII.,LVIII.
9912,LVIII.,
9913,LVIII.,"The swamp is cleared, yet on the smoother road"
9914,LVIII.,Their speed they slack not till they reach the house
9915,LVIII.,Of a poor drunken settler then abroad
9916,LVIII.,"On his nocturnal revels, while the spouse"
9917,LVIII.,"Was left to mourn his oft-indulged carouse,"
9918,LVIII.,And tremble for his safety from the cold.
9919,LVIII.,No sense of danger e'er could him arouse
9920,LVIII.,From his sad sunken state. Drink had such hold
9921,LVIII.,On his gross appetite he seemed to Satan sold.
9922,LVIII.,
9923,LIX.,LIX.
9924,LIX.,
9925,LIX.,"And yet the wife, the mother of his babes,"
9926,LIX.,Ne'er breathed reproach against her low-sunk mate.
9927,LIX.,Such love as her's it is which sometimes saves
9928,LIX.,A wretched husband from a drunkard's fate.
9929,LIX.,"'Tis true such love is oft repaid with hate,"
9930,LIX.,And driven to distraction wives may say
9931,LIX.,Hard things of men who bring them to a state
9932,LIX.,"Of heartfelt woe, and drive their feet astray"
9933,LIX.,"From Virtue's paths, until they shun the light of day."
9934,LIX.,
9935,LX.,LX.
9936,LX.,
9937,LX.,"But here and there a character shines forth,"
9938,LX.,"As in this case, most worthy of all praise."
9939,LX.,"For this sweet wife was one of matchless worth,"
9940,LX.,"And her dear name should grace my artless lays,"
9941,LX.,If I by that means could her triumphs raise.
9942,LX.,"She was in truth a noble heroine,"
9943,LX.,Whose brow might well have been bedecked with bays;
9944,LX.,For deeds like hers through every age should shine
9945,LX.,To show the strength of Love and prove it is divine.
9946,LX.,
9947,LXI.,LXI.
9948,LXI.,
9949,LXI.,"O, woman! who has skill of mind or pen"
9950,LXI.,Those feelings to portray that fill thy breast?
9951,LXI.,"All we yet see are glimpses, now and then,"
9952,LXI.,Which make us long the more to know the rest.
9953,LXI.,Self-sacrificing woman! thou'rt possessed
9954,LXI.,Of that which does enable thee to bear
9955,LXI.,A load of misery on thy heart impressed
9956,LXI.,"By wrongs from him who should thy sorrows share,"
9957,LXI.,And make the daily weal his ever constant care.
9958,LXI.,
9959,LXII.,LXII.
9960,LXII.,
9961,LXII.,"His home in that far North wild wilderness,"
9962,LXII.,Had naught about it which could tell the tale
9963,LXII.,"Of what that mother suffered of distress,"
9964,LXII.,For hope--fond hope had kept her strong and hale.
9965,LXII.,It was still whispering she would soon prevail
9966,LXII.,Upon her husband to renounce his sin.
9967,LXII.,This cheered her heart although her face grew pale
9968,LXII.,With anxious care how best she could begin
9969,LXII.,And what means to employ that she might victory win.
9970,LXII.,
9971,LXIII.,LXIII.
9972,LXIII.,
9973,LXIII.,So GOODWORTH found her on that bitter night
9974,LXIII.,"With house quite trim and table neatly laid,"
9975,LXIII.,"And hopeful still though in a serious plight,"
9976,LXIII.,"As we have hinted, very much afraid"
9977,LXIII.,"Lest her dear man should freeze. ""He is,"" she said,"
9978,LXIII.,"""As good a husband as I could desire"
9979,LXIII.,But lot his fault. He always has displayed
9980,LXIII.,Such love for me that I will never tire
9981,LXIII.,"Of loving him, though none my conduct may admire."""
9982,LXIII.,
9983,LXIV.,LXIV.
9984,LXIV.,
9985,LXIV.,And saying this she would have gone alone
9986,LXIV.,The absent one upon the road to seek.
9987,LXIV.,Her ardent love conspicuously shown
9988,LXIV.,"On that occasion, and I fain would speak"
9989,LXIV.,"Her praise with trumpet tongue, though she so meek"
9990,LXIV.,Might blush to hear it and feel half offended.
9991,LXIV.,Now GOODWORTHS thought that one whom they deemed
9992,LXIV.,weak
9993,LXIV.,"Was best at home, yet they her love commended,"
9994,LXIV.,"And volunteered to go, by trusty dog attended."
9995,LXIV.,
9996,LXV.,LXV.
9997,LXV.,
9998,LXV.,'Twas not in vain. Behind a Huge pine tree
9999,LXV.,"The man, o'ercome, was lying fast asleep;"
10000,LXV.,"Nor could they rouse him, so far gone was he,"
10001,LXV.,Or from the cold or from potations deep.
10002,LXV.,An unseen Eye did faithful vigils keep
10003,LXV.,O'er that poor sinner though he knew it not;
10004,LXV.,And thoughts of this has since oft made him weep
10005,LXV.,"Tears of true penitence in that lone spot,"
10006,LXV.,Which gave to him a lesson that he ne'er forgot.
10007,LXV.,
10008,LXVI.,LXVI.
10009,LXVI.,
10010,LXVI.,"This spot was very near to where he lived,"
10011,LXVI.,And the kind friends Drink's hapless victim bore
10012,LXVI.,"To his own home, both feeling truly grieved"
10013,LXVI.,That his sad state would make his wife's heart sore.
10014,LXVI.,"And now the faithful dog trots on before,"
10015,LXVI.,Most clearly glad because his master's found.
10016,LXVI.,"Anon he whines and scratches at the door,"
10017,LXVI.,Which makes his mistress' heart within her bound
10018,LXVI.,As she peers through the dark and tries to catch some sound.
10019,LXVI.,
10020,LXVII.,LXVII.
10021,LXVII.,
10022,LXVII.,Each moment seemed an hour as thus she stood
10023,LXVII.,"In doubt, expecting some great evil near;"
10024,LXVII.,And when they came the sight nigh froze her blood.
10025,LXVII.,"She fainting fell, through mingled grief and fear."
10026,LXVII.,Meanwhile the children in the chamber hear
10027,LXVII.,"A noise below, and leave their snug, warm bed,"
10028,LXVII.,"Then in deep sorrow view their parents dear,"
10029,LXVII.,"And big, warm tears each youngling freely shed,"
10030,LXVII.,For their idea was that both were lying dead.
10031,LXVII.,
10032,LXVIII.,LXVIII.
10033,LXVIII.,
10034,LXVIII.,Our friends knew better and strove eagerly
10035,LXVIII.,To still their cries and consciousness restore
10036,LXVIII.,Unto the sufferers. Soon with joy they see
10037,LXVIII.,The mother fast recovering; her they bore
10038,LXVIII.,Into her bed-room that they might give more
10039,LXVIII.,Attention to the drunken father's case.
10040,LXVIII.,He in deep stupor did most loudly snore
10041,LXVIII.,"And looked quite frightful with frost-bitten face,"
10042,LXVIII.,Which kept him long in mind of that--his great disgrace.
10043,LXVIII.,
10044,LXIX.,LXIX.
10045,LXIX.,
10046,LXIX.,"Next they rub hard with snow the frozen parts,"
10047,LXIX.,Until the flesh displays a ruddy glow.
10048,LXIX.,This task accomplished they with lighter hearts
10049,LXIX.,Deeper concernment for the mistress show.
10050,LXIX.,"She, quite awake, most anxious was to know"
10051,LXIX.,Their full opinion of her partner's state.
10052,LXIX.,The favorable answer made her bow
10053,LXIX.,"Her heart to God for this his mercy great,"
10054,LXIX.,In having kept her man from such an awful fate.
10055,LXIX.,
10056,LXX.,LXX.
10057,LXX.,
10058,LXX.,"From bed she rose and pressed on them to eat,"
10059,LXX.,But GOODWORTH asked if he might go to prayer.
10060,LXX.,"She gave consent, and 'fore the Mercy Seat"
10061,LXX.,"They poured forth thanks for all their Father's care,"
10062,LXX.,And prayed that all within the house might share
10063,LXX.,"God's rich forgiving love, and ever be"
10064,LXX.,Devoted to his service: so prepare
10065,LXX.,By constant practice of true piety
10066,LXX.,To join the heavenly ranks a happy family.
10067,LXX.,
10068,LXXI.,LXXI.
10069,LXXI.,
10070,LXXI.,And now they eat with keenest appetite
10071,LXXI.,Of the good things so temptingly displayed--
10072,LXXI.,Prime venison with bread both sweet and light;
10073,LXXI.,And charming butter as e'er housewife made
10074,LXXI.,"Were with tea, cream, and rich preserves arrayed"
10075,LXXI.,In plentiful supply upon the table.
10076,LXXI.,"These, backed by welcome, all their toil repaid,"
10077,LXXI.,And they found backwoods cheer indeed no fable;
10078,LXXI.,Yet to partake thereof their hostess was not able.
10079,LXXI.,
10080,LXXII.,LXXII.
10081,LXXII.,
10082,LXXII.,"Their noble team they came so near forgetting,"
10083,LXXII.,Had been provided for with care by one
10084,LXXII.,Who gave his parents no just cause for fretting--
10085,LXXII.,A rather small but very hopeful son.
10086,LXXII.,Around the blazing hearth-fire they begun
10087,LXXII.,To draw their chairs to dwell in converse pure
10088,LXXII.,Another hour on what the Lord had done;
10089,LXXII.,How he had kept them all from death secure
10090,LXXII.,And caused their love and faith through trials to endure.
10091,LXXII.,
10092,LXXIII.,LXXIII.
10093,LXXIII.,
10094,LXXIII.,"The guests both slept in peace and early rose,"
10095,LXXIII.,"And found their host already stirring round,"
10096,LXXIII.,"And suffering much from being badly froze,"
10097,LXXIII.,And strangely nervous at the slightest sound.
10098,LXXIII.,The elder GOODWORTH spoke to him and found
10099,LXXIII.,That Conscience was at work within his breast.
10100,LXXIII.,She made him hear with reverence profound
10101,LXXIII.,Truths suited to the case of one distressed
10102,LXXIII.,"By sense of heinous guilt, which drives away all rest."
10103,LXXIII.,
10104,LXXIV.,LXXIV.
10105,LXXIV.,
10106,LXXIV.,He also brought most forcibly to view
10107,LXXIV.,"The need there was of ""total abstinence"""
10108,LXXIV.,For such as he; and step by step he drew
10109,LXXIV.,The man along till an o'erwhelming sense
10110,LXXIV.,Of his great crime made him wish to commence
10111,LXXIV.,At once a life of strict Sobriety.
10112,LXXIV.,He signed a pledge and straightway banished thence
10113,LXXIV.,"The fiery fluid, his great enemy,--"
10114,LXXIV.,And did thenceforward keep his pledge most sacredly.
10115,LXXIV.,
10116,LXXV.,LXXV.
10117,LXXV.,
10118,LXXV.,"The breakfast o'er, our two friends bade adieu"
10119,LXXV.,"To parents, children, in their kindly way."
10120,LXXV.,'Twas now their wish to push the journey through
10121,LXXV.,Before the close of that short Winter day.
10122,LXXV.,The Sun was up and made a grand display
10123,LXXV.,Upon the trees and shrubs on every hand;
10124,LXXV.,"These all were clad in silvery array,"
10125,LXXV.,"As if transformed by some Magician's wand,"
10126,LXXV.,But 'twas the work of Him who counts the grains of sand.
10127,LXXV.,
10128,LXXVI.,LXXVI.
10129,LXXVI.,
10130,LXXVI.,For through the night a change had taken place--
10131,LXXVI.,Such as we frequent view without surprise.
10132,LXXVI.,"Rain falls and freezes--this is oft the case--,"
10133,LXXVI.,"And trees look pretty to our outward eyes,"
10134,LXXVI.,But is this all that such a view supplies?
10135,LXXVI.,"Can we not trace a Mighty Artist's skill,"
10136,LXXVI.,Which competition from mankind defies?
10137,LXXVI.,"Then let us learn to reverence Him still,"
10138,LXXVI.,Who forms these beauteous scenes according to His will.
10139,LXXVI.,
10140,LXXVII.,LXXVII.
10141,LXXVII.,
10142,LXXVII.,Dear GOODWORTH gazed upon the glittering scene
10143,LXXVII.,Until his soul was filled with ecstacy.
10144,LXXVII.,Here he perceived that God indeed had been
10145,LXXVII.,To clothe dull Winter in great majesty.
10146,LXXVII.,To him it was so full of poetry
10147,LXXVII.,"That he was led to frame another lay,"
10148,LXXVII.,Which seems to me to breathe such melody
10149,LXXVII.,"I must ev'n give it without more delay,"
10150,LXXVII.,"And rest in hope 'twill live far, far beyond my day."

10474,XCIX.,"Luth had a son now grown to man's degree,"

10695,CXVII.,None had the influence of Truth discarded

10703,CXVIII.,The Preacher this performed by full immersion

10707,CXVIII.,I state not this from a desire to wake
