36,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW
37,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,
38,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"When you get to know a fellow, know his joys"
39,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"and know his cares,"
40,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,When you've come to understand him and the
41,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"burdens that he bears,"
42,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,When you've learned the fight he's making and
43,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"the troubles in his way,"
44,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,Then you find that he is different than you
45,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,thought him yesterday.
46,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,You find his faults are trivial and there's not so
47,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,much to blame
48,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,In the brother that you jeered at when you only
49,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,knew his name.
50,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,
51,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,You are quick to see the blemish in the distant
52,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"neighbor's style,"
53,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,You can point to all his errors and may sneer
54,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"at him the while,"
55,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,And your prejudices fatten and your hates
56,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,more violent grow
57,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,As you talk about the failures of the man you
58,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"do not know,"
59,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"But when drawn a little closer, and your hands"
60,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"and shoulders touch,"
61,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,You find the traits you hated really don't
62,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,amount to much.
63,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,
64,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"When you get to know a fellow, know his every"
65,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"mood and whim,"
66,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,You begin to find the texture of the splendid
67,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,side of him;
68,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"You begin to understand him, and you cease to"
69,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"scoff and sneer,"
70,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,For with understanding always prejudices disappear.
71,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,You begin to find his virtues and his faults you
72,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"cease to tell,"
73,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,For you seldom hate a fellow when you know
74,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,him very well.
75,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,
76,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,When next you start in sneering and your
77,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"phrases turn to blame,"
78,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,Know more of him you censure than his business
79,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,and his name;
80,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,For it's likely that acquaintance would your
81,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,prejudice dispel
82,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,And you'd really come to like him if you
83,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,knew him very well.
84,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,When you get to know a fellow and you understand
85,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"his ways,"
86,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,"Then his faults won't really matter, for you'll"
87,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,find a lot to praise.
88,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,
89,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,{13}
90,WHEN YOU KNOW A FELLOW,
91,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL
92,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,
93,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,A smudge on his nose and a smear on his cheek
94,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,And knees that might not have been washed in a week;
95,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,"A bump on his forehead, a scar on his lip,"
96,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,A relic of many a tumble and trip:
97,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,"A rough little, tough little rascal, but sweet,"
98,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,Is he that each evening I'm eager to meet.
99,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,
100,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,A brow that is beady with jewels of sweat;
101,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,A face that's as black as a visage can get;
102,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,"A suit that at noon was a garment of white,"
103,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,Now one that his mother declares is a fright:
104,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,"A fun-loving, sun-loving rascal, and fine,"
105,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,Is he that comes placing his black fist in mine.
106,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,
107,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,A crop of brown hair that is tousled and tossed;
108,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,A waist from which two of the buttons are lost;
109,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,"A smile that shines out through the dirt and the grime,"
110,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,And eyes that are flashing delight all the time:
111,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,All these are the joys that I'm eager to meet
112,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,And look for the moment I get to my street.
113,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,
114,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,{14}
115,THE ROUGH LITTLE RASCAL,
116,IT ISN'T COSTLY,IT ISN'T COSTLY
117,IT ISN'T COSTLY,
118,IT ISN'T COSTLY,Does the grouch get richer quicker than the
119,IT ISN'T COSTLY,friendly sort of man?
120,IT ISN'T COSTLY,Can the grumbler labor better than the cheerful
121,IT ISN'T COSTLY,fellow can?
122,IT ISN'T COSTLY,Is the mean and churlish neighbor any cleverer
123,IT ISN'T COSTLY,than the one
124,IT ISN'T COSTLY,"Who shouts a glad ""good morning,"" and then"
125,IT ISN'T COSTLY,smiling passes on?
126,IT ISN'T COSTLY,
127,IT ISN'T COSTLY,Just stop and think about it.  Have you ever
128,IT ISN'T COSTLY,known or seen
129,IT ISN'T COSTLY,"A mean man who succeeded, just because he"
130,IT ISN'T COSTLY,was so mean?
131,IT ISN'T COSTLY,When you find a grouch with honors and with
132,IT ISN'T COSTLY,"money in his pouch,"
133,IT ISN'T COSTLY,You can bet he didn't win them just because
134,IT ISN'T COSTLY,he was a grouch.
135,IT ISN'T COSTLY,
136,IT ISN'T COSTLY,"Oh, you'll not be any poorer if you smile along"
137,IT ISN'T COSTLY,"your way,"
138,IT ISN'T COSTLY,And your lot will not be harder for the kindly
139,IT ISN'T COSTLY,things you say.
140,IT ISN'T COSTLY,Don't imagine you are wasting time for others
141,IT ISN'T COSTLY,that you spend:
142,IT ISN'T COSTLY,You can rise to wealth and glory and still pause
143,IT ISN'T COSTLY,to be a friend.
144,IT ISN'T COSTLY,
145,IT ISN'T COSTLY,{15}
146,IT ISN'T COSTLY,
147,MY CREED,MY CREED
148,MY CREED,
149,MY CREED,To live as gently as I can;
150,MY CREED,"To be, no matter where, a man;"
151,MY CREED,To take what comes of good or ill
152,MY CREED,And cling to faith and honor still;
153,MY CREED,"To do my best, and let that stand"
154,MY CREED,The record of my brain and hand;
155,MY CREED,"And then, should failure come to me,"
156,MY CREED,Still work and hope for victory.
157,MY CREED,
158,MY CREED,To have no secret place wherein
159,MY CREED,I stoop unseen to shame or sin;
160,MY CREED,To be the same when I'm alone
161,MY CREED,As when my every deed is known;
162,MY CREED,"To live undaunted, unafraid"
163,MY CREED,Of any step that I have made;
164,MY CREED,To be without pretense or sham
165,MY CREED,Exactly what men think I am.
166,MY CREED,
167,MY CREED,To leave some simple mark behind
168,MY CREED,To keep my having lived in mind;
169,MY CREED,"If enmity to aught I show,"
170,MY CREED,"To be an honest, generous foe,"
171,MY CREED,"To play my little part, nor whine"
172,MY CREED,That greater honors are not mine.
173,MY CREED,"This, I believe, is all I need"
174,MY CREED,For my philosophy and creed.
175,MY CREED,
176,MY CREED,{16}
177,MY CREED,
178,A WISH,A WISH
179,A WISH,
180,A WISH,"I'd like to be a boy again, a care-free prince of"
181,A WISH,"joy again,"
182,A WISH,I'd like to tread the hills and dales the way I
183,A WISH,used to do;
184,A WISH,"I'd like the tattered shirt again, the knickers"
185,A WISH,"thick with dirt again,"
186,A WISH,"The ugly, dusty feet again that long ago I"
187,A WISH,knew.
188,A WISH,"I'd like to play first base again, and Sliver's"
189,A WISH,"curves to face again,"
190,A WISH,"I'd like to climb, the way I did, a friendly"
191,A WISH,apple tree;
192,A WISH,"For, knowing what I do to-day, could I but"
193,A WISH,"wander back and play,"
194,A WISH,I'd get full measure of the joy that boyhood
195,A WISH,gave to me.
196,A WISH,
197,A WISH,"I'd like to be a lad again, a youngster, wild and"
198,A WISH,"glad again,"
199,A WISH,I'd like to sleep and eat again the way I used
200,A WISH,to do;
201,A WISH,"I'd like to race and run again, and drain from"
202,A WISH,"life its fun again,"
203,A WISH,And start another round of joy the moment
204,A WISH,one was through.
205,A WISH,"But care and strife have come to me, and often"
206,A WISH,"days are glum to me,"
207,A WISH,
208,A WISH,{17}
209,A WISH,
210,A WISH,And sleep is not the thing it was and food
211,A WISH,is not the same;
212,A WISH,"And I have sighed, and known that I must"
213,A WISH,"journey on again to sigh,"
214,A WISH,And I have stood at envy's point and heard
215,A WISH,the voice of shame.
216,A WISH,
217,A WISH,I've learned that joys are fleeting things; that
218,A WISH,parting pain each meeting brings;
219,A WISH,"That gain and loss are partners here, and so"
220,A WISH,are smiles and tears;
221,A WISH,That only boys from day to day can drain and
222,A WISH,fill the cup of play;
223,A WISH,That age must mourn for what is lost
224,A WISH,throughout the coming years.
225,A WISH,But boys cannot appreciate their priceless joy
226,A WISH,until too late
227,A WISH,And those who own the charms I had will
228,A WISH,soon be changed to men;
229,A WISH,"And then, they too will sit, as I, and backward"
230,A WISH,turn to look and sigh
231,A WISH,"And share my longing, vain, to be a care-free boy again."

236,WHAT A BABY COSTS,
237,WHAT A BABY COSTS,"""How much do babies cost?"" said he"
238,WHAT A BABY COSTS,The other night upon my knee;
239,WHAT A BABY COSTS,"And then I said:  ""They cost a lot;"

242,WHAT A BABY COSTS,"A lot of heart-ache and despair,"

247,WHAT A BABY COSTS,
248,WHAT A BABY COSTS,"""For babies people have to pay"
249,WHAT A BABY COSTS,A heavy price from day to day--
250,WHAT A BABY COSTS,There is no way to get one cheap.
251,WHAT A BABY COSTS,"Why, sometimes when they're fast asleep"
252,WHAT A BABY COSTS,You have to get up in the night
253,WHAT A BABY COSTS,And go and see that they're all right.
254,WHAT A BABY COSTS,But what they cost in constant care
255,WHAT A BABY COSTS,"And worry, does not half compare"
256,WHAT A BABY COSTS,With what they bring of joy and bliss--
257,WHAT A BABY COSTS,You'd pay much more for just a kiss.
258,WHAT A BABY COSTS,
259,WHAT A BABY COSTS,"""Who buys a baby has to pay"
260,WHAT A BABY COSTS,A portion of the bill each day;
261,WHAT A BABY COSTS,He has to give his time and thought
262,WHAT A BABY COSTS,Unto the little one he's bought.
263,WHAT A BABY COSTS,He has to stand a lot of pain
264,WHAT A BABY COSTS,Inside his heart and not complain;
265,WHAT A BABY COSTS,And pay with lonely days and sad
266,WHAT A BABY COSTS,For all the happy hours he's had.
267,WHAT A BABY COSTS,"All this a baby costs, and yet"
268,WHAT A BABY COSTS,"His smile is worth it all, you bet."""

273,MOTHER,
274,MOTHER,Never a sigh for the cares that she bore for me
275,MOTHER,Never a thought of the joys that flew by;
276,MOTHER,"Her one regret that she couldn't do more for me,"
277,MOTHER,"Thoughtless and selfish, her Master was I."
278,MOTHER,
279,MOTHER,"Oh, the long nights that she came at my call to me!"
280,MOTHER,"Oh, the soft touch of her hands on my brow!"

283,MOTHER,
284,MOTHER,"Slave to her baby!  Yes, that was the way of her,"

353,MA AND THE AUTO,
354,MA AND THE AUTO,Before we take an auto ride Pa says to Ma:
355,MA AND THE AUTO,"""My dear,"
356,MA AND THE AUTO,Now just remember I don't need suggestions
357,MA AND THE AUTO,from the rear.
358,MA AND THE AUTO,If you will just sit still back there and hold

366,MA AND THE AUTO,
367,MA AND THE AUTO,"Ma promises that she'll keep still, then off we"
368,MA AND THE AUTO,"gayly start,"
369,MA AND THE AUTO,But soon she notices ahead a peddler and his
370,MA AND THE AUTO,cart.
371,MA AND THE AUTO,"""You'd better toot your horn,"" says she, ""to let"
372,MA AND THE AUTO,him know we're near;
373,MA AND THE AUTO,"He might turn out!"" and Pa replies: ""Just"
374,MA AND THE AUTO,"shriek at him, my dear."""
375,MA AND THE AUTO,"And then he adds: ""Some day, some guy will"
376,MA AND THE AUTO,make a lot of dough
377,MA AND THE AUTO,By putting horns on tonneau seats for women-folks
378,MA AND THE AUTO,"to blow!"""
379,MA AND THE AUTO,
380,MA AND THE AUTO,"A little farther on Ma cries: ""He signaled for"

382,MA AND THE AUTO,"And Pa says: ""Did he?"" in a tone that's hot"
383,MA AND THE AUTO,enough to burn.
384,MA AND THE AUTO,"""Oh, there's a boy on roller skates!"" cries Ma."
385,MA AND THE AUTO,"""Now do go slow."
386,MA AND THE AUTO,"I'm sure he doesn't see our car."" And Pa says:"
387,MA AND THE AUTO,"""I dunno,"
388,MA AND THE AUTO,"I think I don't need glasses yet, but really it"
389,MA AND THE AUTO,may be
390,MA AND THE AUTO,That I am blind and cannot see what's right

392,MA AND THE AUTO,

408,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS
409,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,
410,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,He little knew the sorrow that was in his vacant
411,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,chair;
412,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,"He never guessed they'd miss him, or he'd"
413,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,surely have been there;
414,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,He couldn't see his mother or the lump that
415,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,"filled her throat,"
416,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,Or the tears that started falling as she read
417,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,his hasty note;
418,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,"And he couldn't see his father, sitting sorrowful"
419,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,"and dumb,"
420,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,Or he never would have written that he thought
421,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,he couldn't come.
422,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,
423,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,He little knew the gladness that his presence
424,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,"would have made,"
425,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,"And the joy it would have given, or he never"
426,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,would have stayed.
427,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,He didn't know how hungry had the little
428,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,mother grown
429,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,Once again to see her baby and to claim him
430,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,for her own.
431,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,He didn't guess the meaning of his visit
432,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,Christmas Day
433,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,Or he never would have written that he
434,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,couldn't get away.
435,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,
436,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,He couldn't see the fading of the cheeks that
437,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,"once were pink,"
438,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,And the silver in the tresses; and he didn't
439,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,stop to think
440,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,"How the years are passing swiftly, and next"
441,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,Christmas it might be
442,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,There would be no home to visit and no mother
443,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,dear to see.
444,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,He didn't think about it--I'll not say he didn't
445,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,care.
446,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,He was heedless and forgetful or he'd surely
447,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,have been there.
448,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,
449,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,Are you going home for Christmas? Have you
450,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,written you'll be there?
451,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,Going home to kiss the mother and to show
452,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,her that you care?
453,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,Going home to greet the father in a way to
454,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,make him glad?
455,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,If you're not I hope there'll never come a time
456,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,you'll wish you had.
457,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,Just sit down and write a letter--it will make
458,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,their heart strings hum
459,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,With a tune of perfect gladness--if you'll tell
460,ON GOING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS,them that you'll come.

488,AT SUGAR CAMP,At Sugar Camp our noonday meal
489,AT SUGAR CAMP,"Is eaten in the open air,"
490,AT SUGAR CAMP,Where through the leaves the sunbeams steal
491,AT SUGAR CAMP,And simple is our bill of fare.
492,AT SUGAR CAMP,
493,AT SUGAR CAMP,At Sugar Camp in peace we dwell
494,AT SUGAR CAMP,And none is boastful of himself;
495,AT SUGAR CAMP,None plots to gain with shot and shell
496,AT SUGAR CAMP,His neighbor's bit of land or pelf.
497,AT SUGAR CAMP,"The roar of cannon isn't heard,"
498,AT SUGAR CAMP,There stilled is money's tempting voice;
499,AT SUGAR CAMP,Someone detects a new-come bird
500,AT SUGAR CAMP,And at her presence all rejoice.
501,AT SUGAR CAMP,
502,AT SUGAR CAMP,At Sugar Camp the cook is kind;
503,AT SUGAR CAMP,His steak is broiling o'er the coals
504,AT SUGAR CAMP,And in its sputtering we find
505,AT SUGAR CAMP,Sweet harmony for tired souls.
506,AT SUGAR CAMP,"There, sheltered by the friendly trees,"
507,AT SUGAR CAMP,"As boys we sit to eat our meal,"
508,AT SUGAR CAMP,"And, brothers to the birds and bees,"

1740,COURAGE,"It's part of his hours, his days and his years,"

2166,THE READY ARTISTS,This dullness with a beauty that no mortal hand

2173,THE READY ARTISTS,We shall revel soon in colors only Nature's

2175,THE READY ARTISTS,And the humblest plant that's sleeping unto

3527,A BEAR STORY,Jim always kept a stock of bread

3561,A BEAR STORY,"An' said ""Woof! Woof!"" which meant ""Look"

4182,HOUSE-HUNTING,We want the latest thing in homes;
4183,HOUSE-HUNTING,To life we'll not be reconciled
4184,HOUSE-HUNTING,Until we have a bathroom tiled.
4185,HOUSE-HUNTING,
4186,HOUSE-HUNTING,"A butler's pantry we desire,"
4187,HOUSE-HUNTING,Although no butler do we hire;
4188,HOUSE-HUNTING,Nell's life will be one round of gloom
4189,HOUSE-HUNTING,"Without a closet for the broom,"
4190,HOUSE-HUNTING,And mine will dreary be and sour
4191,HOUSE-HUNTING,Unless the bathroom has a shower.
4192,HOUSE-HUNTING,
4193,HOUSE-HUNTING,For months and months we've sat and dreamed
4194,HOUSE-HUNTING,Of paneled walls and ceilings beamed
4195,HOUSE-HUNTING,"And built-in cases for the books,"
4196,HOUSE-HUNTING,An attic room to be the cook's.
4197,HOUSE-HUNTING,No house will she consent to view
4198,HOUSE-HUNTING,"Unless it has a sun room, too."
4199,HOUSE-HUNTING,
4200,HOUSE-HUNTING,There must be wash bowls here and there
4201,HOUSE-HUNTING,To save much climbing of the stair;
4202,HOUSE-HUNTING,A sleeping porch we both demand--
4203,HOUSE-HUNTING,This fad has swept throughout the land--
4204,HOUSE-HUNTING,"And, Oh, 'twill give her heart a wrench"
4205,HOUSE-HUNTING,"Not to possess a few doors, French."
4206,HOUSE-HUNTING,
4207,HOUSE-HUNTING,I want to dig and walk around
4208,HOUSE-HUNTING,At least full fifty feet of ground;
4209,HOUSE-HUNTING,She wants the latest style in tubs;
4210,HOUSE-HUNTING,"I want more room for trees and shrubs,"
4211,HOUSE-HUNTING,"And a garage, with light and heat,"
4212,HOUSE-HUNTING,That can be entered from the street.
4213,HOUSE-HUNTING,
4214,HOUSE-HUNTING,The trouble is the things we seek
4215,HOUSE-HUNTING,Cannot be bought for ten-a-week.
4216,HOUSE-HUNTING,And all the joys for which we sigh
4217,HOUSE-HUNTING,Are just too rich for us to buy.
4218,HOUSE-HUNTING,We have the taste to cut a dash:
4219,HOUSE-HUNTING,The thing we're lacking most is cash.
