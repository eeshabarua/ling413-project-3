203,TOWNSEND.,
204,TOWNSEND.,It has been said that the contrasts of light and shade are as
205,TOWNSEND.,"necessary to biography as to painting, and that the character"
206,TOWNSEND.,which is radiant with genius and virtue requires to be relieved
207,TOWNSEND.,by more common and opposite qualities. Though this may be true
208,TOWNSEND.,"as a principle, there are many exceptions; and the life of Henry"
209,TOWNSEND.,"Kirke White, whose merits were unalloyed by a single vice, is one"
210,TOWNSEND.,of the most memorable. The history of his short and melancholy
211,TOWNSEND.,"career, by Mr. Southey, is extremely popular; and when it is"
212,TOWNSEND.,remembered that its author is one of the most distinguished of
213,TOWNSEND.,"living writers, that as a biographer he is unrivalled, and that"
214,TOWNSEND.,"he had access to all the materials which exist, it would be as"
215,TOWNSEND.,"vain to expect from the present Memoir any new facts, as it would"
216,TOWNSEND.,be absurd to hope that it will be more worthy of attention than
217,TOWNSEND.,the imperishable monument which his generous friend has erected
218,TOWNSEND.,to his memory.
219,TOWNSEND.,
220,TOWNSEND.,"There is, however, nothing inconsistent with this admission, in"
221,TOWNSEND.,presuming that a Life of the Poet might be written almost as
222,TOWNSEND.,"interesting as the one alluded to, and without the writer assuming"
223,TOWNSEND.,to himself any unusual sagacity. As Mr. Southey's narrative is
224,TOWNSEND.,"prefixed to a collection of all Kirke White's remains, in prose as"
225,TOWNSEND.,"well as in verse, his letters are inserted as part of his works,"
226,TOWNSEND.,instead of extracts from them being introduced into the Memoir.
227,TOWNSEND.,"This volume will, on the contrary, be confined to his Poems; and"
228,TOWNSEND.,such parts of his letters as describe his situation and feelings
229,TOWNSEND.,at particular periods will be introduced into the account of his
230,TOWNSEND.,"life. Indeed, so frequent are the allusions to himself in those"
231,TOWNSEND.,"letters as well as in his poems, that he may be almost considered"
232,TOWNSEND.,an autobiographer; and the writer who substitutes his own cold and
233,TOWNSEND.,lifeless sketch for the glowing and animated portrait which these
234,TOWNSEND.,"memorials of genius afford, must either be deficient in skill, or"
235,TOWNSEND.,be under the dominion of overweening vanity.
236,TOWNSEND.,
237,TOWNSEND.,"Few who have risen to eminence were, on the paternal side at"
238,TOWNSEND.,"least, of humbler origin than Henry Kirke White. His father, John"
239,TOWNSEND.,"White, was a butcher at Nottingham; but his mother, who bore the"
240,TOWNSEND.,"illustrious name of Neville, is said to have belonged to a"
241,TOWNSEND.,respectable family in Staffordshire. He was born at Nottingham on
242,TOWNSEND.,"the 21st of March, 1785; and in his earliest years indications"
243,TOWNSEND.,were observed of the genius for which he was afterwards
244,TOWNSEND.,"distinguished. In his poem ""Childhood,"" he has graphically"
245,TOWNSEND.,"described the little school where, between the age of three and"
246,TOWNSEND.,"five, he"
247,TOWNSEND.,
248,TOWNSEND.,"""enter'd, though with toil and pain,"
249,TOWNSEND.,"The low vestibule of learning's fane."""
250,TOWNSEND.,
251,TOWNSEND.,The venerable dame by whom he was
252,TOWNSEND.,
253,TOWNSEND.,"""inured to alphabetic toils,"""
254,TOWNSEND.,
255,TOWNSEND.,"and whose worth he gratefully commemorates, had the discernment"
256,TOWNSEND.,"to perceive her charge's talents, and even  foretold his future"
257,TOWNSEND.,celebrity:
258,TOWNSEND.,
259,TOWNSEND.,"""And, as she gave my diligence its praise,"
260,TOWNSEND.,"Talk'd of the honour of my future days."""
261,TOWNSEND.,
262,TOWNSEND.,"If he did not deceive himself, it was at this period that his"
263,TOWNSEND.,imagination became susceptible of poetic associations. Speaking
264,TOWNSEND.,of the eagerness with which he left the usual sports of children
265,TOWNSEND.,"to listen to tales of imaginary woe, and of the effect which they"
266,TOWNSEND.,"produced, he says,"
267,TOWNSEND.,
268,TOWNSEND.,"""Beloved moment! then 't was first I caught"
269,TOWNSEND.,The first foundation of romantic thought;
270,TOWNSEND.,"Then first I shed bold Fancy's thrilling tear,"
271,TOWNSEND.,Then first that Poesy charm'd mine infant ear.
272,TOWNSEND.,"Soon stored with much of legendary lore,"
273,TOWNSEND.,The sports of childhood charm'd my soul no more;
274,TOWNSEND.,"Far from the scene of gaiety and noise,"
275,TOWNSEND.,"Far, far from turbulent and empty joys,"
276,TOWNSEND.,"I hied me to the thick o'erarching shade,"
277,TOWNSEND.,"And there, on mossy carpet, listless laid;"
278,TOWNSEND.,"While at my feet the rippling runnel ran,"
279,TOWNSEND.,The days of wild romance antique I'd scan;
280,TOWNSEND.,"Soar on the wings of fancy through the air,"
281,TOWNSEND.,"To realms of light, and pierce the radiance there."""
282,TOWNSEND.,
283,TOWNSEND.,"The peculiar disposition of his mind, having thus early displayed"
284,TOWNSEND.,"itself, every day added to its force. Study and abstraction were his"
285,TOWNSEND.,"greatest pleasures, and a love of reading became his predominant"
286,TOWNSEND.,"passion. ""I could fancy,"" said his eldest sister, ""I see him in his"
287,TOWNSEND.,"little chair with a large book upon his knee, and my mother calling,"
288,TOWNSEND.,"'Henry, my love, come to dinner,' which was repeated so often"
289,TOWNSEND.,"without being regarded, that she was obliged to change the tone of"
290,TOWNSEND.,"her voice before she could rouse him."""
291,TOWNSEND.,
292,TOWNSEND.,At the age of six he was placed under the care of the Rev. John
293,TOWNSEND.,"Blanchard, who kept the best school in Nottingham, where he learnt"
294,TOWNSEND.,"writing, arithmetic, and French; and he continued there for"
295,TOWNSEND.,several years. During that time two facts are related of him which
296,TOWNSEND.,"prove the precocity of his talents. When about seven, he was"
297,TOWNSEND.,accustomed to go secretly into his father's kitchen and teach the
298,TOWNSEND.,servant to read and write; and he composed a tale of a Swiss
299,TOWNSEND.,"emigrant, which he gave her, being too diffident to show it to his"
300,TOWNSEND.,mother. In his eleventh year he wrote a separate theme for each of
301,TOWNSEND.,the twelve or fourteen boys in his class; and the excellence of
302,TOWNSEND.,the various pieces obtained his master's applause.
303,TOWNSEND.,
304,TOWNSEND.,"Henry was destined for his father's trade, and the efforts of his"
305,TOWNSEND.,mother to change that intention were for some time fruitless. Even
306,TOWNSEND.,"while he was at school, one day in every week, and his leisure"
307,TOWNSEND.,"hours on the others, were employed in carrying meat to his father's"
308,TOWNSEND.,customers; but a dispute between his father and his master having
309,TOWNSEND.,"caused him to be removed from school, one of the ushers, from"
310,TOWNSEND.,"malice or ignorance, told his mother that it was impossible to make"
311,TOWNSEND.,her son do any thing. The person who reported so unfavourably of
312,TOWNSEND.,"his abilities, little knew that he had then given ample evidence of"
313,TOWNSEND.,"his talents, in some poetical satires which his treatment at school"
314,TOWNSEND.,"had provoked, but which he afterwards destroyed."
315,TOWNSEND.,
316,TOWNSEND.,Soon after he quitted Mr. Blanchard's school he was intrusted to
317,TOWNSEND.,"Mr. Shipley, who discovered his pupil's abilities, and relieved"
318,TOWNSEND.,his friends' uneasiness on the subject. His earliest production
319,TOWNSEND.,"that has been preserved was written in his thirteenth year, ""On"
320,TOWNSEND.,"being confined to School one pleasant Morning in Spring,"" in which"
321,TOWNSEND.,"a schoolboy's love of liberty, and his envy of the freedom of a"
322,TOWNSEND.,"neighbouring wren, are expressed with plaintive simplicity."
323,TOWNSEND.,
324,TOWNSEND.,About this time a slight improvement took place in his situation.
325,TOWNSEND.,"His mother, to whom he was indebted for all the happiness of his"
326,TOWNSEND.,"childhood, opened a day school, and, as it abstracted her from the"
327,TOWNSEND.,"groveling cares of a butcher's shop, his home was made much more"
328,TOWNSEND.,"comfortable; and, instead of being confined to his father's"
329,TOWNSEND.,"business, he was placed in a stocking loom, with the view of"
330,TOWNSEND.,"bringing him up to the trade of a hosier, the poverty of his"
331,TOWNSEND.,family still precluding the hope of a profession.
332,TOWNSEND.,
333,TOWNSEND.,It may easily be believed that this occupation ill agreed with the
334,TOWNSEND.,"aspirations of his mind. From his mother he had few secrets, and in"
335,TOWNSEND.,"her ear he breathed his disgust and unhappiness. ""He could not bear,"""
336,TOWNSEND.,"he said, ""the idea of spending some years of his life in shining"
337,TOWNSEND.,"and folding up stockings;"" he wanted ""something to occupy his brain,"
338,TOWNSEND.,"and he should be wretched if he continued longer at this trade, or"
339,TOWNSEND.,"indeed in any thing, except one of the learned professions."" For a"
340,TOWNSEND.,"year these remonstrances were ineffectual; but no persuasions, even"
341,TOWNSEND.,"when urged with maternal tenderness, could reconcile him to his lot."
342,TOWNSEND.,"He sought for consolation with the Muses, and wrote an ""Address to"
343,TOWNSEND.,"Contemplation,"" in which he describes his feelings:"
344,TOWNSEND.,
345,TOWNSEND.,"""Why along"
346,TOWNSEND.,"The dusky track of commerce should I toil,"
347,TOWNSEND.,"When, with an easy competence content,"
348,TOWNSEND.,"I can alone be happy; where, with thee,"
349,TOWNSEND.,"I may enjoy the loveliness of Nature,"
350,TOWNSEND.,And loose the wings of fancy! Thus alone
351,TOWNSEND.,Can I partake of happiness on earth;
352,TOWNSEND.,"And to be happy here is man's chief end,"
353,TOWNSEND.,"For to be happy he must needs be good."""
354,TOWNSEND.,
355,TOWNSEND.,There are few obstacles that perseverance will not overcome; and
356,TOWNSEND.,penury and a parent's obstinacy were both surmounted by Kirke
357,TOWNSEND.,White's importunity. Finding it useless to chain him longer to the
358,TOWNSEND.,"hosier's loom, he was placed in the office of Messrs. Coldham and"
359,TOWNSEND.,"Enfield, Town Clerk and attorneys of Nottingham, some time in May,"
360,TOWNSEND.,"1799, when he was in his fifteenth year; but as a premium could"
361,TOWNSEND.,"not be given with him, it was agreed that he should serve two"
362,TOWNSEND.,years before he was articled. A few months after he entered upon
363,TOWNSEND.,"his new employment, he began a correspondence with his brother,"
364,TOWNSEND.,"Mr. Neville White, who was then a medical student in London; and"
365,TOWNSEND.,"in a letter, dated in September, 1799, he thus spoke of his"
366,TOWNSEND.,situation and prospects:
367,TOWNSEND.,
368,TOWNSEND.,"""It is now nearly four months since I entered into Mr. Coldham's"
369,TOWNSEND.,"office; and it is with pleasure I can assure you, that I never yet"
370,TOWNSEND.,"found any thing disagreeable, but, on the contrary, every thing I"
371,TOWNSEND.,"do seems a pleasure to me, and for a very obvious reason,--it is a"
372,TOWNSEND.,business which I like--a business which I chose before all others;
373,TOWNSEND.,"and I have two good-tempered, easy masters, but who will,"
374,TOWNSEND.,"nevertheless, see that their business is done in a neat and proper"
375,TOWNSEND.,"manner.""--""A man that understands the law is sure to have business;"
376,TOWNSEND.,"and in case I have no thoughts, in case, that is, that I do not"
377,TOWNSEND.,"aspire to hold the honourable place of a barrister, I shall feel"
378,TOWNSEND.,sure of gaining a genteel livelihood at the business to which I am
379,TOWNSEND.,"articled."""
380,TOWNSEND.,
381,TOWNSEND.,"At the suggestion of his employers, he devoted the greater part of"
382,TOWNSEND.,"his leisure to Latin; and, though he was but slightly assisted, he"
383,TOWNSEND.,"was able in ten months to read Horace with tolerable facility, and"
384,TOWNSEND.,had made some progress in Greek. Having but little time for these
385,TOWNSEND.,"pursuits, he accustomed himself to decline the Greek nouns and"
386,TOWNSEND.,"verbs during his walks to and from the office, and he thereby"
387,TOWNSEND.,"acquired a habit of studying while walking, that never deserted"
388,TOWNSEND.,"him. The account which Mr. Southey has given of his application,"
389,TOWNSEND.,"and of the success that attended it, is astonishing. Though living"
390,TOWNSEND.,"with his family, he nearly estranged himself from their society."
391,TOWNSEND.,"At meals, and during the evenings, a book was constantly in his"
392,TOWNSEND.,"hands; and as he refused to sup with them, to prevent any loss of"
393,TOWNSEND.,"time, his meal was sent to him in his little apartment. Law,"
394,TOWNSEND.,"Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese, chemistry,"
395,TOWNSEND.,"astronomy, electricity, drawing, music, and mechanics, by turns"
396,TOWNSEND.,engaged his attention; and though his acquirements in some of
397,TOWNSEND.,"those studies were very superficial, his proficiency in many of"
398,TOWNSEND.,them was far from contemptible. His papers on law evince so much
399,TOWNSEND.,"industry, that had that subject alone occupied his leisure hours,"
400,TOWNSEND.,his diligence would have been commendable. He was a tolerable
401,TOWNSEND.,"Italian scholar, and in the classics he afterwards attained"
402,TOWNSEND.,"reputation; but of the sciences and of Spanish and Portuguese, his"
403,TOWNSEND.,"knowledge was not, it may be inferred, very great. His ear for"
404,TOWNSEND.,"music was good, and his passionate attachment to it is placed"
405,TOWNSEND.,beyond a doubt by his verses on its effects:
406,TOWNSEND.,
407,TOWNSEND.,"""With her in pensive mood I long to roam"
408,TOWNSEND.,"At midnight's hour, or evening's calm decline,"
409,TOWNSEND.,"And thoughtful o'er the falling streamlet's foam,"
410,TOWNSEND.,"In calm Seclusion's hermit-walks recline:"""
411,TOWNSEND.,
412,TOWNSEND.,"But he checked his ardour, lest it might interfere with more"
413,TOWNSEND.,essential studies: and his musical attainments were limited to
414,TOWNSEND.,"playing pleasingly on the piano, composing the bass to the air"
415,TOWNSEND.,at the same time.
416,TOWNSEND.,
417,TOWNSEND.,"Ambition was one of the most powerful feelings of his nature, and"
418,TOWNSEND.,"it is rare indeed, when it is not the companion of great talents."
419,TOWNSEND.,It developed itself first in spurning trade; and no sooner did he
420,TOWNSEND.,"find himself likely to become an attorney, than he aspired to the"
421,TOWNSEND.,bar. But his earliest and strongest passion was for literary
422,TOWNSEND.,distinction; and he was scarcely removed from the trammels of
423,TOWNSEND.,"school, before he sought admission into a literary society, in his"
424,TOWNSEND.,"native town. His extreme youth rendered him objectionable; but,"
425,TOWNSEND.,"after repeated refusals, he at last succeeded. In the association"
426,TOWNSEND.,"there were six professors, and being, on the first vacancy,"
427,TOWNSEND.,"appointed to the chair of literature, he soon justified the"
428,TOWNSEND.,"choice. Taking ""genius"" as his theme, he addressed the assembly in"
429,TOWNSEND.,"an extemporaneous lecture of two hours and three-quarters duration,"
430,TOWNSEND.,"with so much success, that the audience unanimously voted him"
431,TOWNSEND.,"their thanks, declaring that ""the society had never heard a better"
432,TOWNSEND.,"lecture delivered from the chair which he so much honoured."" To"
433,TOWNSEND.,"judge properly of this circumstance, it would be necessary to"
434,TOWNSEND.,know of whom the society was composed; but with so flattering a
435,TOWNSEND.,"testimony to his abilities, the sanguine boy naturally placed a"
436,TOWNSEND.,high estimate on them.
437,TOWNSEND.,
438,TOWNSEND.,"The establishment of a Magazine called the Monthly Preceptor,"
439,TOWNSEND.,"which proposed prize themes for young persons, afforded Kirke"
440,TOWNSEND.,White an opportunity of trying his literary powers. In a letter
441,TOWNSEND.,"written in June, 1800, to his brother, speaking of that work he"
442,TOWNSEND.,"says, ""I am noticed as worthy of commendation, and as affording"
443,TOWNSEND.,an encouraging prospect of future excellence. You will laugh. I
444,TOWNSEND.,"have also turned poet, and have translated an Ode of Horace into"
445,TOWNSEND.,"English verse."" His productions gained him several of the prizes;"
446,TOWNSEND.,"and he soon afterwards became a contributor to the Monthly Mirror,"
447,TOWNSEND.,"his compositions in which attracted the attention of Mr. Hill, the"
448,TOWNSEND.,"proprietor of the work, and of Mr. Capel Lofft, a gentleman who"
449,TOWNSEND.,distinguished himself by his patronage of Bloomfield.
450,TOWNSEND.,
451,TOWNSEND.,Though on entering an attorney's office the bar was the object of
452,TOWNSEND.,"his hopes, a constitutional deafness soon convinced him that he"
453,TOWNSEND.,"was not adapted for the duties of an advocate; and his thoughts,"
454,TOWNSEND.,"from conscientious motives, became directed to the Church."
455,TOWNSEND.,
456,TOWNSEND.,"When about fifteen, his mind was agitated by doubt and anxiety on"
457,TOWNSEND.,the most important of all subjects; and the chaos of opinions
458,TOWNSEND.,which extensive and miscellaneous reading so often produces on
459,TOWNSEND.,"ardent and imaginative temperaments, is well described in his"
460,TOWNSEND.,"little poem entitled, ""My own Character,"" wherein he represents"
461,TOWNSEND.,"himself as a prey to the most opposite impressions, and as being"
462,TOWNSEND.,in a miserable state of incertitude:
463,TOWNSEND.,
464,TOWNSEND.,"""First I premise it's my honest conviction,"
465,TOWNSEND.,"That my breast is the chaos of all contradiction,"
466,TOWNSEND.,"Religious--deistic--now loyal and warm,"
467,TOWNSEND.,Then a dagger-drawn democrat hot for reform;
468,TOWNSEND.,*        *        *        *        *
469,TOWNSEND.,"Now moody and sad, now unthinking and gay,"
470,TOWNSEND.,"To all points of the compass I veer in a day."""
471,TOWNSEND.,
472,TOWNSEND.,In this sketch there is evidently much truth; and it affords a
473,TOWNSEND.,"striking idea of a plastic and active mind, on which every thing"
474,TOWNSEND.,"makes an impression, where one idea follows another in such rapid"
475,TOWNSEND.,"succession, that the former is not so entirely removed, but that"
476,TOWNSEND.,some remains of it are amalgamated with its successor. A youth
477,TOWNSEND.,whose intellect is thus tossed in a whirlpool of conflicting
478,TOWNSEND.,"speculations, resembles a goodly ship newly launched, which, until"
479,TOWNSEND.,"properly steadied by ballast, reels from side to side, the sport"
480,TOWNSEND.,of every undulation of the waters.
481,TOWNSEND.,
482,TOWNSEND.,About this time young White's religious feelings were strongly
483,TOWNSEND.,"affected by the conversion of his friend, Mr. Almond, whose"
484,TOWNSEND.,opinions were previously as unsettled as his own. To escape the
485,TOWNSEND.,raillery with which he expected White would assail him on learning
486,TOWNSEND.,"the change in his sentiments, Almond avoided his society; and when"
487,TOWNSEND.,"his friend offered to defend his opinions, if Henry would allow"
488,TOWNSEND.,"the divine originality of the Bible, he exclaimed, ""Good God! you"
489,TOWNSEND.,"surely regard me in a worse light than I deserve."" The discussion"
490,TOWNSEND.,"that followed, and the perusal of Scott's ""Force of Truth,"" which"
491,TOWNSEND.,"Almond placed in his hands, induced him to direct his attention"
492,TOWNSEND.,seriously to the subject; but an affecting incident soon afterwards
493,TOWNSEND.,showed how deeply he was then influenced by religious considerations.
494,TOWNSEND.,"On the evening before Mr. Almond left Nottingham for Cambridge, he"
495,TOWNSEND.,was requested by White to accompany him to his apartment. The moment
496,TOWNSEND.,"they entered, Henry burst into tears, declaring that his anguish of"
497,TOWNSEND.,mind was insupportable; and he entreated Almond to kneel and pray
498,TOWNSEND.,"for him. Their tears and supplications were cordially mingled, and"
499,TOWNSEND.,"when they were about to separate, White said, ""What must I do? You"
500,TOWNSEND.,"are the only friend to whom I can apply in this agonizing state,"
501,TOWNSEND.,and you are about to leave me. My literary associates are all
502,TOWNSEND.,"inclined to deism. I have no one with whom I can communicate."""
503,TOWNSEND.,
504,TOWNSEND.,It is instructive to learn to what circumstance such a person as
505,TOWNSEND.,"Kirke White was indebted for the knowledge ""which causes not to"
506,TOWNSEND.,"err."" This information occurs in a letter from him to a Mr. Booth,"
507,TOWNSEND.,"in August, 1801; and it also fixes the date of the happy change"
508,TOWNSEND.,"that influenced every thought and every action of his future life,"
509,TOWNSEND.,"which gave the energy of virtue to his exertions, soothed the"
510,TOWNSEND.,"asperities of a temper naturally impetuous and irritable, and"
511,TOWNSEND.,"enabled him, at a period when manhood is full of hope and promise,"
512,TOWNSEND.,"to view the approaches of death with the calmness of a philosopher,"
513,TOWNSEND.,and the resignation of a saint.
514,TOWNSEND.,
515,TOWNSEND.,After thanking Mr. Booth for the present of Jones's work on the
516,TOWNSEND.,"Trinity, he thus describes his religious impressions previous to"
517,TOWNSEND.,"its perusal, and the effect it produced:"
518,TOWNSEND.,
519,TOWNSEND.,"""Religious polemics, indeed, have seldom formed a part of my"
520,TOWNSEND.,studies; though whenever I happened accidentally to turn my
521,TOWNSEND.,"thoughts to the subject of the Protestant doctrine of the Godhead,"
522,TOWNSEND.,"and compared it with Arian and Socinian, many doubts interfered,"
523,TOWNSEND.,and I even began to think that the more nicely the subject was
524,TOWNSEND.,"investigated, the more perplexed it would appear, and was on the"
525,TOWNSEND.,"point of forming a resolution to go to heaven in my own way,"
526,TOWNSEND.,without meddling or involving myself in the inextricable labyrinth
527,TOWNSEND.,"of controversial dispute, when I received and perused this"
528,TOWNSEND.,"excellent treatise, which finally cleared up the mists which my"
529,TOWNSEND.,"ignorance had conjured around me, and clearly pointed out the real"
530,TOWNSEND.,"truth."""
531,TOWNSEND.,
532,TOWNSEND.,"From the moment he became convinced of the truths of Christianity,"
533,TOWNSEND.,"all the enthusiasm of his nature was kindled. The ministry only,"
534,TOWNSEND.,was deemed worthy of his ambition; and he devoted his thoughts to
535,TOWNSEND.,the sacred office with a zeal that justified a hope of the richest
536,TOWNSEND.,"fruits. In a letter to his friend, Mr. Almond, in November, 1803,"
537,TOWNSEND.,"he says,"
538,TOWNSEND.,
539,TOWNSEND.,"""My dear friend, I cannot adequately express what I owe to you on"
540,TOWNSEND.,the score of religion. I told Mr. Robinson you were the first
541,TOWNSEND.,instrument of my being brought to think deeply on religious
542,TOWNSEND.,"subjects; and I feel more and more every day, that if it had not"
543,TOWNSEND.,"been for you, I might, most probably, have been now buried in apathy"
544,TOWNSEND.,"and unconcern. Though I am in a great measure blessed,--I mean"
545,TOWNSEND.,"blessed with faith, now pretty steadfast, and heavy convictions,"
546,TOWNSEND.,"I am far from being happy. My sins have been of a dark hue, and"
547,TOWNSEND.,"manifold: I have made Fame my God, and Ambition my shrine. I have"
548,TOWNSEND.,placed all my hopes on the things of this world. I have knelt to
549,TOWNSEND.,"Dagon; I have worshipped the evil creations of my own proud heart,"
550,TOWNSEND.,and God had well nigh turned his countenance from me in wrath;
551,TOWNSEND.,"perhaps one step further, and he might have shut me for ever from"
552,TOWNSEND.,"his rest. I now turn my eyes to Jesus, my Saviour, my atonement,"
553,TOWNSEND.,with hope and confidence: he will not repulse the imploring
554,TOWNSEND.,"penitent; his arms are open to all, they are open even to me; and"
555,TOWNSEND.,"in return for such a mercy, what can I do less than dedicate my"
556,TOWNSEND.,whole life to his service? My thoughts would fain recur at
557,TOWNSEND.,intervals to my former delights; but I am now on my guard to
558,TOWNSEND.,restrain and keep them in. I know now where they ought to
559,TOWNSEND.,"concentre, and with the blessing of God, they shall there all tend."
560,TOWNSEND.,
561,TOWNSEND.,"""My next publication of poems will be solely religious. I shall"
562,TOWNSEND.,"not destroy those of a different nature, which now lie before me;"
563,TOWNSEND.,"but they will, most probably, sleep in my desk, until, in the good"
564,TOWNSEND.,"time of my great Lord and Master, I shall receive my passport from"
565,TOWNSEND.,this world of vanity. I am now bent on a higher errand than that
566,TOWNSEND.,"of the attainment of poetical fame; poetry, in future, will be my"
567,TOWNSEND.,"relaxation, not my employment.--Adieu to literary ambition! 'You"
568,TOWNSEND.,"do not aspire to be prime minister,' said Mr. Robinson; 'you covet"
569,TOWNSEND.,a far higher character--to be the humblest among those who
570,TOWNSEND.,"minister to their Maker.'"""
571,TOWNSEND.,
572,TOWNSEND.,To the arguments of his friends on the impolicy of quitting a
573,TOWNSEND.,"profession to which he had given so much of his time, and on the"
574,TOWNSEND.,"obstacles to the attainment of his wishes, he was impenetrable."
575,TOWNSEND.,His employers generously offered to cancel his articles as soon as
576,TOWNSEND.,he could show that his resources were likely to support him at the
577,TOWNSEND.,"University. Friends arose as they became necessary, and more than"
578,TOWNSEND.,one or two persons exerted themselves to promote his views; but
579,TOWNSEND.,his principal reliance was on the sale of a little volume of
580,TOWNSEND.,"Poems, which, at the suggestion of Mr. Capel Lofft, he prepared"
581,TOWNSEND.,for the press.
582,TOWNSEND.,
583,TOWNSEND.,"The history of an author's first book is always interesting, and"
584,TOWNSEND.,Kirke White's was attended with unusual incidents. A novice in
585,TOWNSEND.,literature often imagines that it is important his work should be
586,TOWNSEND.,dedicated to some person of rank; and the Countess of Derby was
587,TOWNSEND.,"applied to, who declined, on the ground that she never accepted a"
588,TOWNSEND.,compliment of that nature. He then addressed the Duchess of
589,TOWNSEND.,"Devonshire; and a letter, with the manuscript, was left at her"
590,TOWNSEND.,house. The difficulty of obtaining access to her Grace proved so
591,TOWNSEND.,"great, that more than one letter to his brother was written on the"
592,TOWNSEND.,"subject, in which he indignantly says, ""I am cured of patronage"
593,TOWNSEND.,"hunting; as for begging patronage, I am tired to the soul of it,"
594,TOWNSEND.,"and shall give it up."" Permission to inscribe the book to the"
595,TOWNSEND.,Duchess was at length granted: the book came out in 1803; and a
596,TOWNSEND.,"copy was transmitted to her, of which, however, no notice whatever"
597,TOWNSEND.,was taken.
598,TOWNSEND.,
599,TOWNSEND.,"On the publication of the volume, a copy was sent to each Review,"
600,TOWNSEND.,"with a letter deprecatory of the severity of criticism, an act as"
601,TOWNSEND.,"ill judged as it was useless, since all that a young writer could"
602,TOWNSEND.,"properly say was to be found in the preface, in which he stated"
603,TOWNSEND.,"that his inducement to publish was, ""the facilitation through its"
604,TOWNSEND.,"means of those studies which, from his earliest infancy, have been"
605,TOWNSEND.,"the principal objects of his ambition, and the increase of the"
606,TOWNSEND.,"capacity to pursue these inclinations, which may one day place him"
607,TOWNSEND.,"in an honourable station in the scale of society."""
608,TOWNSEND.,
609,TOWNSEND.,His feelings received a severe wound from the notice of his Poems
610,TOWNSEND.,"in the Monthly Review, the writer of which, not satisfied with saying"
611,TOWNSEND.,"that the production did not ""justify any sanguine expectations,"""
612,TOWNSEND.,"selected four of the worst lines in support of his opinion, and"
613,TOWNSEND.,showed himself insensible of the numerous beauties scattered
614,TOWNSEND.,"through the various pieces. Writing to a friend soon afterwards,"
615,TOWNSEND.,he thus spoke of himself; and more mental wretchedness has seldom
616,TOWNSEND.,been described:
617,TOWNSEND.,
618,TOWNSEND.,"""I am at present under afflictions and contentions of spirit,"
619,TOWNSEND.,"heavier than I have yet ever experienced. I think, at times, I am"
620,TOWNSEND.,"mad, and destitute of religion; my pride is not yet subdued: the"
621,TOWNSEND.,"unfavourable review (in the 'Monthly') of my unhappy work, has cut"
622,TOWNSEND.,deeper than you could have thought; not in a literary point of
623,TOWNSEND.,"view, but as it affects my respectability. It represents me actually"
624,TOWNSEND.,"as a beggar, going about gathering money to put myself at college,"
625,TOWNSEND.,when my book is worthless; and this with every appearance of candour.
626,TOWNSEND.,They have been sadly misinformed respecting me: this review goes
627,TOWNSEND.,"before me wherever I turn my steps; it haunts me incessantly, and"
628,TOWNSEND.,I am persuaded it is an instrument in the hand of Satan to drive me
629,TOWNSEND.,to distraction. I must leave Nottingham. If the answer of the Elland
630,TOWNSEND.,"Society be unfavourable, I purpose writing to the Marquis of"
631,TOWNSEND.,"Wellesley, to offer myself as a student at the academy he has"
632,TOWNSEND.,"instituted at Fort William, in Bengal, and at the proper age to take"
633,TOWNSEND.,orders there. The missionaries at that place have done wonders
634,TOWNSEND.,"already; and I should, I hope, be a valuable labourer in the"
635,TOWNSEND.,"vineyard. If the Marquis take no notice of my application, or do"
636,TOWNSEND.,"not accede to my proposal, I shall place myself in some other way"
637,TOWNSEND.,"of making a meet preparation for the holy office, either in the"
638,TOWNSEND.,"Calvinistic Academy, or in one of the Scotch Universities, where I"
639,TOWNSEND.,"shall be able to live at scarcely any expense."""
640,TOWNSEND.,
641,TOWNSEND.,The criticism just adverted to was as unfeeling as unjust; and but
642,TOWNSEND.,"for the generous conduct of a distinguished living poet, whose"
643,TOWNSEND.,"benevolence of heart is equal to his genius, it might have entirely"
644,TOWNSEND.,"crushed his hopes. Disgusted at the injustice of this criticism,"
645,TOWNSEND.,"Mr. Southey instantly wrote to White, expressing his opinion of the"
646,TOWNSEND.,"merits of his book, and giving him the encouragement and advice"
647,TOWNSEND.,"which none was ever more ready or more able to bestow. Thus, an act"
648,TOWNSEND.,of cruel folly proved in its consequences the most beneficial of
649,TOWNSEND.,the Poet's life. His spirits were invigorated by this considerate
650,TOWNSEND.,"kindness, and his feelings were expressed in glowing terms:"
651,TOWNSEND.,
652,TOWNSEND.,"""I dare not say all I feel respecting your opinion of my little"
653,TOWNSEND.,volume. The extreme acrimony with which the Monthly Review (of all
654,TOWNSEND.,"others the most important) treated me, threw me into a state of"
655,TOWNSEND.,"stupefaction. I regarded all that had passed as a dream, and I"
656,TOWNSEND.,thought I had been deluding myself into an idea of possessing
657,TOWNSEND.,"poetic genius, when, in fact, I had only the longing, without the"
658,TOWNSEND.,"_afflatus._ I mustered resolution enough, however, to write"
659,TOWNSEND.,"spiritedly to them: their answer, in the ensuing number, was a"
660,TOWNSEND.,tacit acknowledgment that they had been somewhat too unsparing in
661,TOWNSEND.,their correction. It was a poor attempt to salve over a wound
662,TOWNSEND.,"wantonly and most ungenerously inflicted. Still I was damped,"
663,TOWNSEND.,because I knew the work was very respectable; and therefore could
664,TOWNSEND.,"not, I concluded, give a criticism grossly deficient in equity,"
665,TOWNSEND.,"the more especially, as I knew of no sort of inducement to"
666,TOWNSEND.,"extraordinary severity. Your letter, however, has revived me, and"
667,TOWNSEND.,I do again venture to hope that I may still produce something
668,TOWNSEND.,which will survive me. With regard to your advice and offers of
669,TOWNSEND.,"assistance, I will not attempt, because I am unable, to thank you"
670,TOWNSEND.,for them. To-morrow morning I depart for Cambridge; and I have
671,TOWNSEND.,"considerable hopes that, as I do not enter into the University"
672,TOWNSEND.,"with any sinister or interested views, but sincerely desire to"
673,TOWNSEND.,"perform the duties of an affectionate and vigilant pastor, and"
674,TOWNSEND.,"become more useful to mankind; I therefore have hopes, I say, that"
675,TOWNSEND.,"I shall find means of support in the University. If I do not, I"
676,TOWNSEND.,shall certainly act in pursuance of your recommendations; and
677,TOWNSEND.,"shall, without hesitation, avail myself of your offers of service,"
678,TOWNSEND.,and of your directions. In a short time this will be determined;
679,TOWNSEND.,"and when it is, I shall take the liberty of writing to you at"
680,TOWNSEND.,"Keswick, to make you acquainted with the result. I have only one"
681,TOWNSEND.,"objection to publishing by subscription, and I confess it has"
682,TOWNSEND.,"weight with me; it is, that, in this step, I shall seem to be"
683,TOWNSEND.,acting upon the advice so unfeelingly and contumeliously given by
684,TOWNSEND.,"the Monthly Reviewers, who say what is equal to this, that had I"
685,TOWNSEND.,"gotten a subscription for my poems before their merit was known, I"
686,TOWNSEND.,"might have succeeded; provided, it seems, I had made a particular"
687,TOWNSEND.,statement of my case; like a beggar who stands with his hat in one
688,TOWNSEND.,"hand, and a full account of his cruel treatment on the coast of"
689,TOWNSEND.,"Barbary in the other, and so gives you his penny sheet for your"
690,TOWNSEND.,"sixpence, by way of half purchase, half charity. I have materials"
691,TOWNSEND.,for another volume; but they were written principally while
692,TOWNSEND.,"Clifton Grove was in the press, or soon after, and do not now at"
693,TOWNSEND.,"all satisfy me. Indeed, of late, I have been obliged to desist,"
694,TOWNSEND.,"almost entirely, from converse with the dames of Helicon. The"
695,TOWNSEND.,"drudgery of an attorney's office, and the necessity of preparing"
696,TOWNSEND.,"myself, in case I should succeed in getting to college, in what"
697,TOWNSEND.,"little leisure I could boast, left no room for the flights of the"
698,TOWNSEND.,"imagination."""
699,TOWNSEND.,
700,TOWNSEND.,As soon as there were reasonable hopes of an adequate support
701,TOWNSEND.,"being obtained for him at Cambridge, he went to the village of"
702,TOWNSEND.,"Wilford, for a month, to recruit his health, on which intense"
703,TOWNSEND.,application had made great inroads. Near this place were Clifton
704,TOWNSEND.,"Woods, the subject of one of his Poems, and which had long been"
705,TOWNSEND.,his favourite resort. Here he fully indulged in that love of the
706,TOWNSEND.,"beauties of nature, which forms a leading trait in the Poetic"
707,TOWNSEND.,character: and on this occasion he gave full reins to those
708,TOWNSEND.,"reveries of the imagination, of the delight of which a Poet only"
709,TOWNSEND.,is sensible. His lines on Wilford Church Yard show the melancholy
710,TOWNSEND.,"tone of his mind; and those Verses, as well as his ""Ode to"
711,TOWNSEND.,"Disappointment,"" of which no praise would be too extravagant,"
712,TOWNSEND.,"appear to have been written, on learning from his mother, before"
713,TOWNSEND.,"he left Wilford, that the efforts made to place him at Cambridge"
714,TOWNSEND.,"had failed. It was evidently to this circumstance, which for the"
715,TOWNSEND.,"time blighted his aspirations, that he alluded, when he says he"
716,TOWNSEND.,"was,"
717,TOWNSEND.,
718,TOWNSEND.,"""From Hope's summit hurl'd."""
719,TOWNSEND.,
720,TOWNSEND.,"His remark to his mother on this occasion evinced, nevertheless,"
721,TOWNSEND.,"great energy of mind. His complaints were confined to verse, for"
722,TOWNSEND.,the disappointment had no other effect upon his conduct than to
723,TOWNSEND.,"induce him to apply to his studies with unprecedented vigour,"
724,TOWNSEND.,"that, since he was to revert to the law as a profession, he might"
725,TOWNSEND.,"not be, as he observed, ""a _mediocre_ attorney."" He read regularly"
726,TOWNSEND.,"from five in the morning until some time after midnight, and"
727,TOWNSEND.,occasionally passed whole nights without lying down; and the
728,TOWNSEND.,"entreaties, even when accompanied by the tears of his mother,"
729,TOWNSEND.,"that he would not thus destroy his health, did not induce him to"
730,TOWNSEND.,relax his zeal.
731,TOWNSEND.,
732,TOWNSEND.,"Symptoms of consumption, the disease to which he ultimately became"
733,TOWNSEND.,"a victim, and which he designates, in one of his many allusions to"
734,TOWNSEND.,"it, as"
735,TOWNSEND.,
736,TOWNSEND.,"""The most fatal of Pandora's train,"""
737,TOWNSEND.,
738,TOWNSEND.,"began now to excite the anxiety of his family. Illness was, however,"
739,TOWNSEND.,forgotten in the realization of the hope dearest to his heart. The
740,TOWNSEND.,exertions of his friends proved successful at a time when all
741,TOWNSEND.,expectations had vanished; and by their united efforts it was
742,TOWNSEND.,"resolved that he should become a sizer of St. John's College,"
743,TOWNSEND.,"Cambridge, his brother Neville, his mother, and a benevolent"
744,TOWNSEND.,"individual, whose name is not mentioned, having agreed to contribute"
745,TOWNSEND.,"to support him. It appears, that if he had not succeeded in that"
746,TOWNSEND.,"object, he intended to have joined the society of orthodox dissenters,"
747,TOWNSEND.,for which purpose he underwent an examination. Though his attainments
748,TOWNSEND.,"and character proved satisfactory on that occasion, his volume of"
749,TOWNSEND.,"Poems rose in judgment against him, and nothing but the approbation"
750,TOWNSEND.,Mr. Southey had expressed of them prevented his work from being
751,TOWNSEND.,considered a disqualification for the ministry. His feelings on
752,TOWNSEND.,the prospect of entering the Church are described with great force
753,TOWNSEND.,"in his letter, dated in April, 1804."
754,TOWNSEND.,
755,TOWNSEND.,"""Most fervently do I return thanks to God for this providential"
756,TOWNSEND.,"opening: it has breathed new animation into me, and my breast"
757,TOWNSEND.,expands with the prospect of becoming the minister of Christ where
758,TOWNSEND.,I most desired it; but where I almost feared all probability of
759,TOWNSEND.,"success was nearly at an end. Indeed, I had begun to turn my"
760,TOWNSEND.,"thoughts to the dissenters, as people of whom I was destined, not"
761,TOWNSEND.,"by choice, but necessity, to become the pastor. Still, although I"
762,TOWNSEND.,"knew I should be happy anywhere, so that I were a profitable"
763,TOWNSEND.,"labourer in the vineyard, I did, by no means, feel that calm, that"
764,TOWNSEND.,indescribable satisfaction which I do when I look toward that
765,TOWNSEND.,"Church, which I think in the main formed on the apostolic model,"
766,TOWNSEND.,and from which I am decidedly of opinion there is no positive
767,TOWNSEND.,grounds for dissent. I return thanks to God for keeping me so long
768,TOWNSEND.,"in suspense, for I know it has been beneficial to my soul, and I"
769,TOWNSEND.,feel a considerable trust that the way is now about to be made
770,TOWNSEND.,"clear, and that my doubts and fears on this head will, in due"
771,TOWNSEND.,"time, be removed."""
772,TOWNSEND.,
773,TOWNSEND.,"Being advised to degrade for a year, and to place himself with a"
774,TOWNSEND.,"private tutor, he went to the Rev. Mr. Grainger of Winteringham,"
775,TOWNSEND.,"in Lincolnshire, in the autumn of 1804. While under that gentleman's"
776,TOWNSEND.,"care he studied with such intense fervour, that fears were excited"
777,TOWNSEND.,"not for his health only, but for his intellect; and a second severe"
778,TOWNSEND.,"attack of illness was the consequence. Poetry was now laid aside,"
779,TOWNSEND.,"and as he himself told a friend in February, 1805,"
780,TOWNSEND.,
781,TOWNSEND.,"""My poor neglected Muse has lain absolutely unnoticed by me for"
782,TOWNSEND.,"the last four months, during which period I have been digging in"
783,TOWNSEND.,"the mines of Scapula for Greek roots, and instead of drinking with"
784,TOWNSEND.,eager delight the beauties of Virgil have been culling and drying
785,TOWNSEND.,"his phrases for future use.""--""I fear my good genius, who was"
786,TOWNSEND.,wont to visit me with nightly visions in woods and brakes and by
787,TOWNSEND.,"the river's marge, is now dying of a fen ague, and I shall thus"
788,TOWNSEND.,probably emerge from my retreat not a hair-brained son of
789,TOWNSEND.,"imagination, but a sedate black-lettered book worm, with a head"
790,TOWNSEND.,"like an etymologicon magnum."""
791,TOWNSEND.,
792,TOWNSEND.,"To Mr. Capel Lofft, in the September following, after stating that"
793,TOWNSEND.,"all his time was employed in preparing himself for orders, his"
794,TOWNSEND.,"estimate of the necessary qualifications being, very high, he"
795,TOWNSEND.,observed:
796,TOWNSEND.,
797,TOWNSEND.,"""I often, however, cast a look of fond regret to the darling"
798,TOWNSEND.,"occupations of my younger hours, and the tears rush into my eyes,"
799,TOWNSEND.,"as I fancy I see the few wild flowers of poetic genius, with which"
800,TOWNSEND.,"I have been blessed, withering with neglect. Poetry has been to me"
801,TOWNSEND.,something more than amusement; it has been a cheering companion
802,TOWNSEND.,"when I have had no other to fly to, and a delightful solace when"
803,TOWNSEND.,"consolation has been in some measure needful. I cannot, therefore,"
804,TOWNSEND.,"discard so old and faithful a friend without deep regret,"
805,TOWNSEND.,"especially when I reflect that, stung by my ingratitude, he may"
806,TOWNSEND.,"desert me for ever!"""
807,TOWNSEND.,
808,TOWNSEND.,"But the old fire was, he adds, rekindled by looking over some of"
809,TOWNSEND.,his pieces which Mr. Lofft wished to print; and he transmitted to
810,TOWNSEND.,"that gentleman a short Poem, expressive of his sorrow at taking"
811,TOWNSEND.,leave of his favourite pursuit. The following passages could only
812,TOWNSEND.,"have arisen from a love of Poetry, which it was not in the power"
813,TOWNSEND.,of severer studies to extinguish:
814,TOWNSEND.,
815,TOWNSEND.,Heart-soothing Poesy! Though thou hast ceased
816,TOWNSEND.,To hover o'er the many voiced strings
817,TOWNSEND.,"Of my long silent lyre, yet thou canst still"
818,TOWNSEND.,"Call the warm tear from its thrice hallow'd cell,"
819,TOWNSEND.,And with recalled images of bliss
820,TOWNSEND.,"Warm my reluctant heart. Yes, I would throw,"
821,TOWNSEND.,"Once more would throw, a quick and hurried hand"
822,TOWNSEND.,"O'er the responding chords. It hath not ceased,"
823,TOWNSEND.,"It cannot, will not cease; the heavenly warmth"
824,TOWNSEND.,"Plays round my heart, and mantles o'er my cheek;"
825,TOWNSEND.,"Still, though unbidden, plays. Fair Poesy!"
826,TOWNSEND.,"The summer and the spring, the wind and rain,"
827,TOWNSEND.,"Sunshine and storm, with various interchange,"
828,TOWNSEND.,"Have mark'd full many a day, and week, and month,"
829,TOWNSEND.,"Since by dark wood, or hamlet far retired,"
830,TOWNSEND.,"Spell-struck, with thee I loiter'd. Sorceress!"
831,TOWNSEND.,I cannot burst thy bonds!
832,TOWNSEND.,
833,TOWNSEND.,"In October, 1805, Kirke White became a resident member of St."
834,TOWNSEND.,"John's College, Cambridge; and such was the use he had made of his"
835,TOWNSEND.,"time at Winteringham, that he was distinguished for his classical"
836,TOWNSEND.,knowledge. But he had dearly purchased his superiority. His
837,TOWNSEND.,"constitution was much shattered when he went to Mr. Grainger, and"
838,TOWNSEND.,every day brought with it new proofs that his career had nearly
839,TOWNSEND.,reached its bounds. The only chance of prolonging his life was to
840,TOWNSEND.,"seek a milder climate, and to abandon study entirely. As in all"
841,TOWNSEND.,"great minds, Fame was, however, dearer to him than existence. He"
842,TOWNSEND.,felt that every thing connected with his future prospects was at
843,TOWNSEND.,stake; and he adhered to a course of rigorous application until
844,TOWNSEND.,nature gave way. During his first term he became a candidate for
845,TOWNSEND.,one of the University scholarships; but the increased exertion he
846,TOWNSEND.,underwent was attended by results that obliged him to retire from
847,TOWNSEND.,the contest. At this moment the general college examination
848,TOWNSEND.,"approached, and thinking that if he failed his hopes would be"
849,TOWNSEND.,"blasted for ever, he taxed his energies to the uttermost, during"
850,TOWNSEND.,"the fortnight which intervened, to meet the trial. His illness,"
851,TOWNSEND.,"however, speedily returned; and, with tears in his eyes, he"
852,TOWNSEND.,"informed his tutor, Mr. Catton, that he could not go into the Hall"
853,TOWNSEND.,"to be examined. That gentleman, whose kindness to the Poet"
854,TOWNSEND.,"entitles his name to respect, urged him to support himself during"
855,TOWNSEND.,the six days of the examination. Powerful stimulants were
856,TOWNSEND.,"administered, and he was pronounced the first man of his year. The"
857,TOWNSEND.,"triumph, complete and exhilarating as it was, too closely"
858,TOWNSEND.,"resembled that of the generous steed, who, in distancing his"
859,TOWNSEND.,"competitors, reaches the goal, and dies; and his own ideas of the"
860,TOWNSEND.,sacrifices with which such an honour must be attended were very
861,TOWNSEND.,"poetical. He said to an intimate friend, almost the last time he"
862,TOWNSEND.,"saw him, that were he to paint a picture of Fame crowning a"
863,TOWNSEND.,"distinguished under graduate after the senate house examination,"
864,TOWNSEND.,he would represent her as concealing a death's head under a mask
865,TOWNSEND.,of beauty.
866,TOWNSEND.,
867,TOWNSEND.,"Soon after this event, Kirke White went to London, and on"
868,TOWNSEND.,"Christmas Eve he wrote to his mother from town, stating that his"
869,TOWNSEND.,"health had been rather affected by study, that he came to London"
870,TOWNSEND.,"for amusement, and that his tutor had, in the kindest manner,"
871,TOWNSEND.,"relieved his mind from pecuniary cares, and cheered him with the"
872,TOWNSEND.,assurance that his talents would be rewarded by his College. But
873,TOWNSEND.,it is from his letters to his friend that the real state to which
874,TOWNSEND.,"excitement and labour had reduced him, is to be learnt, because,"
875,TOWNSEND.,"to allay the fears of his relations, he represented himself to"
876,TOWNSEND.,"them, as being much better than he actually was:"
877,TOWNSEND.,
878,TOWNSEND.,"London, Christmas, 1805."
879,TOWNSEND.,
880,TOWNSEND.,"""I wrote you a letter, which now lies in my drawer at St. John's;"
881,TOWNSEND.,"but in such a weak state of body, and in so desponding and"
882,TOWNSEND.,"comfortless a tone of mind, that I knew it would give you pain,"
883,TOWNSEND.,and therefore I chose not to send it. I have indeed been ill; but
884,TOWNSEND.,"thanks to God, I am recovered. My nerves were miserably shattered"
885,TOWNSEND.,"by over application, and the absence of all that could amuse, and"
886,TOWNSEND.,the presence of many things which weighed heavy upon my spirits.
887,TOWNSEND.,"When I found myself too ill to read, and too desponding to endure"
888,TOWNSEND.,"my own reflections, I discovered that it is really a miserable"
889,TOWNSEND.,thing to be destitute of the soothing and supporting hand when
890,TOWNSEND.,nature most needs it. I wandered up and down from one man's room
891,TOWNSEND.,"to another, and from one College to another, imploring society, a"
892,TOWNSEND.,"little conversation, and a little relief of the burden which"
893,TOWNSEND.,"pressed upon my spirits; and I am sorry to say, that those who,"
894,TOWNSEND.,"when I was cheerful and lively, sought my society with avidity,"
895,TOWNSEND.,"now, when I actually needed conversation, were too busy to grant"
896,TOWNSEND.,"it. Our College examination was then approaching, and I perceived"
897,TOWNSEND.,with anguish that I had read for the university scholarship until
898,TOWNSEND.,"I had barely time to get up our private subjects, and that as I"
899,TOWNSEND.,"was now too ill to read, all hope of getting through the"
900,TOWNSEND.,examination with decent respectability was at an end. This was an
901,TOWNSEND.,"additional grief. I went to our tutor, with tears in my eyes, and"
902,TOWNSEND.,"told him I must absent myself from the examination,--a step which"
903,TOWNSEND.,would have precluded me from a station amongst the prize-men until
904,TOWNSEND.,the second year. He earnestly entreated me to run the risk. My
905,TOWNSEND.,surgeon gave me strong stimulants and supporting medicines during
906,TOWNSEND.,"the examination week; and I passed, I believe, one of the most"
907,TOWNSEND.,respectable examinations amongst them. As soon as ever it was
908,TOWNSEND.,"over, I left Cambridge, by the advice of my surgeon and tutor,"
909,TOWNSEND.,and I feel myself now pretty strong. I have given up the thought
910,TOWNSEND.,"of sitting for the University scholarship, in consequence of my"
911,TOWNSEND.,"illness, as the course of my reading was effectually broken. In"
912,TOWNSEND.,"this place I have been much amused, and have been received with an"
913,TOWNSEND.,attention in the literary circles which I neither expected nor
914,TOWNSEND.,deserved. But this does not affect me as it once would have done:
915,TOWNSEND.,my views are widely altered; and I hope that I shall in time learn
916,TOWNSEND.,"to lay my whole heart at the foot of the cross."""
917,TOWNSEND.,
918,TOWNSEND.,"Early in January following he returned to Cambridge, and"
919,TOWNSEND.,"imprudently resumed his old habits of study, according to the"
920,TOWNSEND.,"following plan: ""Rise at half-past five; devotions and walk till"
921,TOWNSEND.,seven; chapel and breakfast till eight; study and lectures till
922,TOWNSEND.,"one; four and a half clear reading; walk, &c. and dinner, and"
923,TOWNSEND.,"Wollaston, and chapel to six; six to nine reading, three hours;"
924,TOWNSEND.,"nine to ten devotions; bed at ten."" With him, however, exercise"
925,TOWNSEND.,"was but slight relaxation, as his intellectual faculties were kept"
926,TOWNSEND.,"on the stretch during his walks, and he is known to have committed"
927,TOWNSEND.,"to memory a whole tragedy of Euripides in this manner, and as they"
928,TOWNSEND.,"were not less exerted in his devotions, his mind must have been"
929,TOWNSEND.,"intensely occupied for twelve or fourteen hours a day, at a moment"
930,TOWNSEND.,when perfect quiet and rest were indispensable. Within a very few
931,TOWNSEND.,"weeks he paid a heavy penalty for his indiscretion. To his friend,"
932,TOWNSEND.,"Mr. Haddock, he wrote on the 17th of February, 1806:"
933,TOWNSEND.,
934,TOWNSEND.,"""Do not think I am reading hard; I believe it is all over with"
935,TOWNSEND.,that. I have had a recurrence of my old complaint within this last
936,TOWNSEND.,"four or five days, which has half unnerved me for every thing. The"
937,TOWNSEND.,state of my health is really miserable; I am well and lively in
938,TOWNSEND.,"the morning, and overwhelmed with nervous horrors in the evening."
939,TOWNSEND.,I do not know how to proceed with regard to my studies:--a very
940,TOWNSEND.,slight overstretch of the mind in the daytime occasions me not
941,TOWNSEND.,"only a sleepless night, but a night of gloom and horror. The"
942,TOWNSEND.,systole and diastole of my heart seem to be playing at ball--the
943,TOWNSEND.,"stake, my life. I can only say the game is not yet decided:--I"
944,TOWNSEND.,allude to the violence of the palpitation. I am going to mount the
945,TOWNSEND.,"Gog-magog hills this morning, in quest of a good night's sleep."
946,TOWNSEND.,"The Gog-magog hills for my body, and the Bible for my mind, are my"
947,TOWNSEND.,"only medicines. I am sorry to say, that neither are quite"
948,TOWNSEND.,"adequate. Cui, igitur; dandum est vitio? Mihi prorsus. I hope, as"
949,TOWNSEND.,"the summer comes, my spirits (which have been with the swallows, a"
950,TOWNSEND.,"winter's journey) will come with it. When my spirits are restored,"
951,TOWNSEND.,my health will be restored:--the 'fons mali' lies there. Give me
952,TOWNSEND.,"serenity and equability of mind, and all will be well."""
953,TOWNSEND.,
954,TOWNSEND.,"He, however, rallied again; but he seems to have been aware that"
955,TOWNSEND.,"his end was not far distant, for in March he told his brother that"
956,TOWNSEND.,"though his stay at Cambridge, in the long vacation, was important,"
957,TOWNSEND.,"he intended to go to Nottingham for his health, and more"
958,TOWNSEND.,"particularly for his mother's sake; adding, ""I shall be glad to"
959,TOWNSEND.,"moor all my family in the harbour of religious trust, and in the"
960,TOWNSEND.,calm seas of religious peace. These concerns are apt at times to
961,TOWNSEND.,"escape me; but they now press much upon my heart, and I think it"
962,TOWNSEND.,is my first duty to see that my family are safe in the most
963,TOWNSEND.,"important of all affairs."""
964,TOWNSEND.,
965,TOWNSEND.,"In April, however, he drew a pleasing picture of his future life,"
966,TOWNSEND.,in which his filial and paternal tenderness are conspicuous; but
967,TOWNSEND.,he soon afterwards went to Nottingham; and in a letter to his
968,TOWNSEND.,"friend Mr. Leeson, written from that town, on the 7th of April,"
969,TOWNSEND.,he gave a very melancholy account of himself:
970,TOWNSEND.,
971,TOWNSEND.,"""It seems determined upon, by my mother, that I cannot be spared,"
972,TOWNSEND.,"since the time of my stay is so very short, and my health so very"
973,TOWNSEND.,uncertain. The people here can scarcely be persuaded that any
974,TOWNSEND.,"thing ails me; so well do I look; but occasional depressions,"
975,TOWNSEND.,"especially after any thing has occurred to occasion uneasiness,"
976,TOWNSEND.,still harass me. My mind is of a very peculiar cast. I began to
977,TOWNSEND.,"think too early; and the indulgence of certain trains of thought,"
978,TOWNSEND.,"and too free an exercise of the imagination, have superinduced a"
979,TOWNSEND.,morbid kind of sensibility; which is to the mind what excessive
980,TOWNSEND.,irritability is to the body. Some circumstances occurred on my
981,TOWNSEND.,"arrival at Nottingham, which gave me just cause for inquietude"
982,TOWNSEND.,"and anxiety; the consequences were insomnia, and a relapse into"
983,TOWNSEND.,causeless dejections. It is my business now to curb these
984,TOWNSEND.,"irrational and immoderate affections, and, by accustoming myself"
985,TOWNSEND.,"to sober thought and cool reasoning, to restrain these freaks and"
986,TOWNSEND.,"vagaries of the fancy, and redundancies of [Greek: melancholia]."
987,TOWNSEND.,"When I am well, I cannot help entertaining a sort of contempt for"
988,TOWNSEND.,the weakness of mind which marks my indispositions. Titus when
989,TOWNSEND.,"well, and Titus when ill, are two distinct persons. The man, when"
990,TOWNSEND.,"in health, despises the man, when ill, for his weakness, and the"
991,TOWNSEND.,"latter envies the former for his felicity."""
992,TOWNSEND.,
993,TOWNSEND.,As his health declined his prospects seemed to brighten. He was
994,TOWNSEND.,again pronounced first at the great College examination; he was
995,TOWNSEND.,"one of the three best theme writers, whose merits were so nearly"
996,TOWNSEND.,equal that the examiners could not decide between them; and he
997,TOWNSEND.,was a prize-man both in the mathematical and logical or general
998,TOWNSEND.,"examination, and in Latin composition. His College offered him a"
999,TOWNSEND.,"private tutor at its expense, and Mr. Catton obtained exhibitions"
1000,TOWNSEND.,"for him to the value of sixty-six pounds per annum, by which he"
1001,TOWNSEND.,was enabled to give up the pecuniary assistance he had received
1002,TOWNSEND.,"from his friends. But even at this moment, when the world promised"
1003,TOWNSEND.,"so much, his situation was truly deplorable. The highest honours"
1004,TOWNSEND.,"of the University were supposed to be within his grasp, and the"
1005,TOWNSEND.,"conviction that such was the general opinion, goaded him on to the"
1006,TOWNSEND.,most strenuous exertions when he was incapable of the slightest.
1007,TOWNSEND.,"This struggle between his mental and physical powers, was not,"
1008,TOWNSEND.,"however, of long duration. In July he was seized with an attack"
1009,TOWNSEND.,"that threatened his life, and which he thus described in a letter"
1010,TOWNSEND.,to Mr. Maddock:
1011,TOWNSEND.,
1012,TOWNSEND.,"""Last Saturday morning I rose early, and got up some rather"
1013,TOWNSEND.,"abstruse problems in mechanics for my tutor, spent an hour with"
1014,TOWNSEND.,"him, between eight and nine got my breakfast, and read the Greek"
1015,TOWNSEND.,"History (at breakfast) till ten, then sat down to decipher some"
1016,TOWNSEND.,"logarithm tables. I think I had not done any thing at them, when"
1017,TOWNSEND.,I lost myself. At a quarter past eleven my laundress found me
1018,TOWNSEND.,"bleeding in four different places in my face and head, and"
1019,TOWNSEND.,"insensible. I got up and staggered about the room, and she, being"
1020,TOWNSEND.,"frightened, ran away, and told my gyp to fetch a surgeon. Before"
1021,TOWNSEND.,"he came I was sallying out with my flannel gown on, and my"
1022,TOWNSEND.,"academical gown over it; he made me put on my coat, and then I"
1023,TOWNSEND.,"went to Mr. Farish's: he opened a vein, and my recollection"
1024,TOWNSEND.,"returned. My own idea was, that I had fallen out of bed, and so I"
1025,TOWNSEND.,told Mr. Farish at first; but I afterwards remembered that I had
1026,TOWNSEND.,"been to Mr. Fiske, and breakfasted. Mr. Catton has insisted on my"
1027,TOWNSEND.,"consulting Sir Isaac Pennington, and the consequence is, that I"
1028,TOWNSEND.,"am to go through a course of blistering, &c. which, after the"
1029,TOWNSEND.,"bleeding, will leave me weak enough."
1030,TOWNSEND.,
1031,TOWNSEND.,"""I am, however, very well, except as regards the doctors, and"
1032,TOWNSEND.,"yesterday I drove into the country to Saffron Walden, in a gig."
1033,TOWNSEND.,"My tongue is in a bad condition, from a bite which I gave it"
1034,TOWNSEND.,"either in my fall, or in the moments of convulsion. My nose has"
1035,TOWNSEND.,also come badly off. I believe I fell against my reading desk.
1036,TOWNSEND.,My other wounds are only rubs and scratches on the carpet. I am
1037,TOWNSEND.,"ordered to remit my studies for a while, by the common advice both"
1038,TOWNSEND.,of doctors and tutors. Dr. Pennington hopes to prevent any
1039,TOWNSEND.,"recurrence of the fit. He thinks it looks towards epilepsy, of the"
1040,TOWNSEND.,horrors of which malady I have a very full and precise idea; and I
1041,TOWNSEND.,"only pray that God will spare me as respects my faculties, however"
1042,TOWNSEND.,"else it may seem good to him to afflict me. Were I my own master,"
1043,TOWNSEND.,I know how I should act; but I am tied here by bands which I
1044,TOWNSEND.,cannot burst. I know that change of place is needful; but I must
1045,TOWNSEND.,not indulge in the idea. The college must not pay my tutor for
1046,TOWNSEND.,nothing. Dr. Pennington and Mr. Farish attribute the attack to a
1047,TOWNSEND.,"too continued tension of the faculties. As I am much alone now, I"
1048,TOWNSEND.,"never get quite off study, and I think incessantly. I know nature"
1049,TOWNSEND.,"will not endure this. They both proposed my going home, but Mr. * *"
1050,TOWNSEND.,"did not hint at it, although much concerned; and, indeed, I know"
1051,TOWNSEND.,home would be a bad place for me in my present situation. I look
1052,TOWNSEND.,"round for a resting place, and I find none. Yet there is one,"
1053,TOWNSEND.,"which I have long too, too much disregarded, and thither I must"
1054,TOWNSEND.,"now betake myself. There are many situations worse than mine, and"
1055,TOWNSEND.,I have no business to complain. If these afflictions should draw
1056,TOWNSEND.,"the bonds tighter which hold me to my Redeemer, it will be well."
1057,TOWNSEND.,You may be assured that you have here a plain statement of my case
1058,TOWNSEND.,"in its true colours without any palliation. I am now well again,"
1059,TOWNSEND.,"and have only to fear a relapse, which I shall do all I can to"
1060,TOWNSEND.,"prevent, by a relaxation in study. I have now written too much."
1061,TOWNSEND.,
1062,TOWNSEND.,"""I am, very sincerely yours,"
1063,TOWNSEND.,
1064,"""H. K. WHITE.","""H. K. WHITE."

1413,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
1414,PREFACE.,
1415,PREFACE.,The following attempts in Verse are laid before the Public with
1416,PREFACE.,extreme diffidence. The Author is very conscious that the juvenile
1417,PREFACE.,"efforts of a youth, who has not received the polish of Academical"
1418,PREFACE.,"discipline, and who has been but sparingly blessed with"
1419,PREFACE.,"opportunities for the prosecution of scholastic pursuits, must"
1420,PREFACE.,necessarily be defective in the accuracy and finished elegance
1421,PREFACE.,which mark the works of the man who has passed his life in the
1422,PREFACE.,"retirement of his study, furnishing his mind with images, and at"
1423,PREFACE.,the same time attaining the power of disposing those images to
1424,PREFACE.,the best advantage.
1425,PREFACE.,
1426,PREFACE.,"The unpremeditated effusions of a Boy, from his thirteenth year,"
1427,PREFACE.,"employed, not in the acquisition of literary information, but in"
1428,PREFACE.,"the more active business of life, must not be expected to exhibit"
1429,PREFACE.,"any considerable portion of the correctness of a Virgil, or the"
1430,PREFACE.,"vigorous compression of a Horace. Men are not, I believe,"
1431,PREFACE.,"frequently known to bestow much, labour on their amusements; and"
1432,PREFACE.,"these poems were, most of them, written merely to beguile a"
1433,PREFACE.,"leisure hour, or to fill up the languid intervals of studies of a"
1434,PREFACE.,severer nature.
1435,PREFACE.,
1436,PREFACE.,"[Greek: Pas to oicheios ergon agapao], ""Every one loves his own"
1437,PREFACE.,"work,"" says Stagyrite; but it was no overweening affection of this"
1438,PREFACE.,kind which induced this publication. Had the author relied on his
1439,PREFACE.,"own judgment only, these Poems would not, in all probability, ever"
1440,PREFACE.,have seen the light.
1441,PREFACE.,
1442,PREFACE.,"Perhaps it may be asked of him, what are his motives for this"
1443,PREFACE.,"publication? He answers--simply these: The facilitation, through"
1444,PREFACE.,"its means, of those studies which, from his earliest infancy, have"
1445,PREFACE.,been the principal objects of his ambition; and the increase of
1446,PREFACE.,the capacity to pursue those inclinations which may one day place
1447,PREFACE.,him in an honourable station in the scale of society.
1448,PREFACE.,
1449,PREFACE.,"The principal Poem in this little collection (Clifton Grove) is,"
1450,PREFACE.,"he fears, deficient in numbers and harmonious coherency of parts."
1451,PREFACE.,"It is, however, merely to be regarded as a description of a"
1452,PREFACE.,"nocturnal ramble in that charming retreat, accompanied with such"
1453,PREFACE.,reflections as the scene naturally suggested. It was written
1454,PREFACE.,"twelve months ago, when the Author was in his sixteenth year:--The"
1455,PREFACE.,Miscellanies are some of them the productions of a very early
1456,PREFACE.,"age.--Of the Odes, that ""To an early Primrose"" was written at"
1457,PREFACE.,thirteen--the others are of a later date.--The Sonnets are chiefly
1458,PREFACE.,"irregular; they have, perhaps, no other claim to that specific"
1459,PREFACE.,"denomination, than that they consist only of fourteen lines."
1460,PREFACE.,
1461,PREFACE.,Such are the Poems towards which I entreat the lenity of the
1462,PREFACE.,Public. The Critic will doubtless find in them much to condemn;
1463,PREFACE.,he may likewise possibly discover something to commend. Let him
1464,PREFACE.,"scan my faults with an indulgent eye, and in the work of that"
1465,PREFACE.,"correction which I invite, let him remember he is holding the iron"
1466,PREFACE.,Mace of Criticism over the flimsy superstructure of a youth of
1467,PREFACE.,"seventeen; and, remembering that, may he forbear from crushing, by"
1468,PREFACE.,"too much rigour, the painted butterfly whose transient colours may"
1469,PREFACE.,otherwise be capable of affording a moment's innocent amusement.

1487,A SKETCH.,
1488,A SKETCH.,"Lo! in the west, fast fades the lingering light,"
1489,A SKETCH.,And day's last vestige takes its silent flight.
1490,A SKETCH.,"No more is heard the woodman's measured stroke,"
1491,A SKETCH.,Which with the dawn from yonder dingle broke;
1492,A SKETCH.,"No more, hoarse clamouring o'er the uplifted head,"
1493,A SKETCH.,The crows assembling seek their wind-rock'd bed;
1494,A SKETCH.,Still'd is the village hum--the woodland sounds
1495,A SKETCH.,"Have ceased to echo o'er the dewy grounds,"
1496,A SKETCH.,"And general silence reigns, save when below"
1497,A SKETCH.,The murmuring Trent is scarcely heard to flow;
1498,A SKETCH.,"And save when, swung by 'nighted rustic late,"
1499,A SKETCH.,"Oft, on its hinge, rebounds the jarring gate;"
1500,A SKETCH.,"Or when the sheep-bell, in the distant vale,"
1501,A SKETCH.,Breathes its wild music on the downy gale.
1502,A SKETCH.,
1503,A SKETCH.,"Now, when the rustic wears the social smile,"
1504,A SKETCH.,"Released from day and its attendant toil,"
1505,A SKETCH.,"And draws his household round their evening fire,"
1506,A SKETCH.,And tells the ofttold tales that never tire;
1507,A SKETCH.,"Or, where the town's blue turrets dimly rise,"
1508,A SKETCH.,"And manufacture taints the ambient skies,"
1509,A SKETCH.,"The pale mechanic leaves the labouring loom,"
1510,A SKETCH.,"The air-pent hold, the pestilential room,"
1511,A SKETCH.,"And rushes out, impatient to begin"
1512,A SKETCH.,The stated course of customary sin:
1513,A SKETCH.,"Now, now my solitary way I bend"
1514,A SKETCH.,Where solemn groves in awful state impend:
1515,A SKETCH.,"And cliffs, that boldly rise above the plain,"
1516,A SKETCH.,"Bespeak, bless'd Clifton! thy sublime domain."
1517,A SKETCH.,"Here lonely wandering o'er the sylvan bower,"
1518,A SKETCH.,I come to pass the meditative hour;
1519,A SKETCH.,"To bid awhile the strife of passion cease,"
1520,A SKETCH.,And woo the calms of solitude and peace.
1521,A SKETCH.,"And oh! thou sacred Power, who rear'st on high"
1522,A SKETCH.,Thy leafy throne where wavy poplars sigh!
1523,A SKETCH.,Genius of woodland shades! whose mild control
1524,A SKETCH.,"Steals with resistless witchery to the soul,"
1525,A SKETCH.,"Come with thy wonted ardour, and inspire"
1526,A SKETCH.,My glowing bosom with thy hallow'd fire.
1527,A SKETCH.,"And thou, too, Fancy, from thy starry sphere,"
1528,A SKETCH.,"Where to the hymning orbs thou lend'st thine ear,"
1529,A SKETCH.,"Do thou descend, and bless my ravish'd sight,"
1530,A SKETCH.,Veil'd in soft visions of serene delight.
1531,A SKETCH.,At thy command the gale that passes by
1532,A SKETCH.,Bears in its whispers mystic harmony.
1533,A SKETCH.,"Thou wavest thy wand, and lo! what forms appear!"
1534,A SKETCH.,On the dark cloud what giant shapes career!
1535,A SKETCH.,"The ghosts of Ossian skim the misty vale,"
1536,A SKETCH.,And hosts of sylphids on the moonbeams sail.
1537,A SKETCH.,"This gloomy alcove darkling to the sight,"
1538,A SKETCH.,Where meeting trees create eternal night;
1539,A SKETCH.,"Save, when from yonder stream the sunny ray,"
1540,A SKETCH.,"Reflected, gives a dubious gleam of day;"
1541,A SKETCH.,"Recalls, endearing to my alter'd mind,"
1542,A SKETCH.,"Times, when beneath the boxen hedge reclined,"
1543,A SKETCH.,I watch'd the lapwing to her clamorous brood;
1544,A SKETCH.,Or lured the robin to its scatter'd food;
1545,A SKETCH.,"Or woke with song the woodland echo wild,"
1546,A SKETCH.,And at each gay response delighted smiled.
1547,A SKETCH.,"How oft, when childhood threw its golden ray"
1548,A SKETCH.,"Of gay romance o'er every happy day,"
1549,A SKETCH.,"Here, would I run, a visionary boy,"
1550,A SKETCH.,"When the hoarse tempest shook the vaulted sky,"
1551,A SKETCH.,"And, fancy-led, beheld the Almighty's form"
1552,A SKETCH.,Sternly careering on the eddying storm;
1553,A SKETCH.,"And heard, while awe congeal'd my inmost soul,"
1554,A SKETCH.,His voice terrific in the thunders roll.
1555,A SKETCH.,With secret joy I view'd with vivid glare
1556,A SKETCH.,The vollied lightnings cleave the sullen air;
1557,A SKETCH.,"And, as the warring winds around reviled,"
1558,A SKETCH.,"With awful pleasure big,--I heard and smiled."
1559,A SKETCH.,Beloved remembrance!--Memory which endears
1560,A SKETCH.,"This silent spot to my advancing years,"
1561,A SKETCH.,"Here dwells eternal peace, eternal rest,"
1562,A SKETCH.,In shades like these to live is to be bless'd.
1563,A SKETCH.,"While happiness evades the busy crowd,"
1564,A SKETCH.,In rural coverts loves the maid to shroud.
1565,A SKETCH.,"And thou too, Inspiration, whose wild flame"
1566,A SKETCH.,"Shoots with electric swiftness through the frame,"
1567,A SKETCH.,"Thou here dost love to sit with upturn'd eye,"
1568,A SKETCH.,"And listen to the stream that murmurs by,"
1569,A SKETCH.,"The woods that wave, the gray owl's silken flight,"
1570,A SKETCH.,The mellow music of the listening night.
1571,A SKETCH.,Congenial calms more welcome to my breast
1572,A SKETCH.,"Than maddening joy in dazzling lustre dress'd,"
1573,A SKETCH.,"To Heaven my prayers, my daily prayers I raise,"
1574,A SKETCH.,"That ye may bless my unambitious days,"
1575,A SKETCH.,"Withdrawn, remote, from all the haunts of strife,"
1576,A SKETCH.,"May trace with me the lowly vale of life,"
1577,A SKETCH.,"And when her banner Death shall o'er me wave,"
1578,A SKETCH.,May keep your peaceful vigils on my grave.
1579,A SKETCH.,"Now as I rove, where wide the prospect grows,"
1580,A SKETCH.,A livelier light upon my vision flows.
1581,A SKETCH.,"No more above the embracing branches meet,"
1582,A SKETCH.,"No more the river gurgles at my feet,"
1583,A SKETCH.,"But seen deep down the cliff's impending side,"
1584,A SKETCH.,"Through hanging woods, now gleams its silver tide."
1585,A SKETCH.,"Dim is my upland path,--across the green"
1586,A SKETCH.,"Fantastic shadows fling, yet oft between"
1587,A SKETCH.,"The chequer'd glooms the moon her chaste ray sheds,"
1588,A SKETCH.,Where knots of bluebells droop their graceful heads.
1589,A SKETCH.,"And beds of violets, blooming 'mid the trees,"
1590,A SKETCH.,Load with waste fragrance the nocturnal breeze.
1591,A SKETCH.,
1592,A SKETCH.,"Say, why does Man, while to his opening sight"
1593,A SKETCH.,"Each shrub presents a source of chaste delight,"
1594,A SKETCH.,"And Nature bids for him her treasures flow,"
1595,A SKETCH.,"And gives to him alone his bliss to know,"
1596,A SKETCH.,Why does he pant for Vice's deadly charms?
1597,A SKETCH.,Why clasp the syren Pleasure to his arms?
1598,A SKETCH.,"And suck deep draughts of her voluptuous breath,"
1599,A SKETCH.,"Though fraught with ruin, infamy, and death?"
1600,A SKETCH.,Could he who thus to vile enjoyment clings
1601,A SKETCH.,Know what calm joy from purer sources springs;
1602,A SKETCH.,"Could he but feel how sweet, how free from strife,"
1603,A SKETCH.,"The harmless pleasures of a harmless life,"
1604,A SKETCH.,"No more his soul would pant for joys impure,"
1605,A SKETCH.,"The deadly chalice would no more allure,"
1606,A SKETCH.,But the sweet potion he was wont to sip
1607,A SKETCH.,Would turn to poison on his conscious lip.
1608,A SKETCH.,
1609,A SKETCH.,"Fair Nature! thee, in all thy varied charms,"
1610,A SKETCH.,Fain would I clasp for ever in my arms!
1611,A SKETCH.,"Thine are the sweets which never, never sate,"
1612,A SKETCH.,Thine still remain through all the storms of fate.
1613,A SKETCH.,"Though not for me, 't was Heaven's divine command"
1614,A SKETCH.,"To roll in acres of paternal land,"
1615,A SKETCH.,"Yet still my lot is bless'd, while I enjoy"
1616,A SKETCH.,Thine opening beauties with a lover's eye.
1617,A SKETCH.,
1618,A SKETCH.,"Happy is he, who, though the cup of bliss"
1619,A SKETCH.,"Has ever shunn'd him when he thought to kiss,"
1620,A SKETCH.,"Who, still in abject poverty or pain,"
1621,A SKETCH.,Can count with pleasure what small joys remain:
1622,A SKETCH.,"Though were his sight convey'd from zone to zone,"
1623,A SKETCH.,"He would not find one spot of ground his own,"
1624,A SKETCH.,"Yet as he looks around, he cries with glee,"
1625,A SKETCH.,These bounding prospects all were made for me:
1626,A SKETCH.,"For me yon waving fields their burden bear,"
1627,A SKETCH.,"For me yon labourer guides the shining share,"
1628,A SKETCH.,"While happy I in idle ease recline,"
1629,A SKETCH.,And mark the glorious visions as they shine.
1630,A SKETCH.,"This is the charm, by sages often told,"
1631,A SKETCH.,Converting all it touches into gold.
1632,A SKETCH.,"Content can soothe where'er by fortune placed,"
1633,A SKETCH.,Can rear a garden in the desert waste.
1634,A SKETCH.,
1635,A SKETCH.,"How lovely, from this hill's superior height,"
1636,A SKETCH.,Spreads the wide view before my straining sight!
1637,A SKETCH.,"O'er many a varied mile of lengthening ground,"
1638,A SKETCH.,"E'en to the blue-ridged hill's remotest bound,"
1639,A SKETCH.,My ken is borne; while o'er my head serene
1640,A SKETCH.,The silver moon illumes the misty scene:
1641,A SKETCH.,"Now shining clear, now darkening in the glade,"
1642,A SKETCH.,In all the soft varieties of shade.
1643,A SKETCH.,
1644,A SKETCH.,"Behind me, lo! the peaceful hamlet lies,"
1645,A SKETCH.,The drowsy god has seal'd the cotter's eyes.
1646,A SKETCH.,"No more, where late the social faggot blazed,"
1647,A SKETCH.,"The vacant peal resounds, by little raised,"
1648,A SKETCH.,"But locked in silence, o'er Arion's[1] star"
1649,A SKETCH.,The slumbering Night rolls on her velvet car:
1650,A SKETCH.,"The church bell tolls, deep sounding down the glade,"
1651,A SKETCH.,The solemn hour for walking spectres made;
1652,A SKETCH.,"The simple ploughboy, wakening with the sound,"
1653,A SKETCH.,"Listens aghast, and turns him startled round,"
1654,A SKETCH.,"Then stops his ears, and strives to close his eyes,"
1655,A SKETCH.,Lest at the sound some grisly ghost should rise.
1656,A SKETCH.,"Now ceased the long, the monitory toll,"
1657,A SKETCH.,Returning silence stagnates in the soul;
1658,A SKETCH.,"Save when, disturbed by dreams, with wild affright,"
1659,A SKETCH.,The deep mouth'd mastiff bays the troubled night:
1660,A SKETCH.,"Or where the village alehouse crowns the vale,"
1661,A SKETCH.,The creaking signpost whistles to the gale.
1662,A SKETCH.,"A little onward let me bend my way,"
1663,A SKETCH.,Where the moss'd seat invites the traveller's stay.
1664,A SKETCH.,"That spot, oh! yet it is the very same;"
1665,A SKETCH.,"That hawthorn gives it shade, and gave it name:"
1666,A SKETCH.,"There yet the primrose opes its earliest bloom,"
1667,A SKETCH.,"There yet the violet sheds its first perfume,"
1668,A SKETCH.,And in the branch that rears above the rest
1669,A SKETCH.,The robin unmolested builds its nest.
1670,A SKETCH.,"'T was here, when hope, presiding o'er my breast,"
1671,A SKETCH.,In vivid colours every prospect dress'd:
1672,A SKETCH.,"'T was here, reclining, I indulged her dreams,"
1673,A SKETCH.,And lost the hour in visionary schemes.
1674,A SKETCH.,"Here, as I press once more the ancient seat,"
1675,A SKETCH.,"Why, bland deceiver! not renew the cheat!"
1676,A SKETCH.,"Say, can a few short years this change achieve,"
1677,A SKETCH.,That thy illusions can no more deceive!
1678,A SKETCH.,"Time's sombrous tints have every view o'erspread,"
1679,A SKETCH.,"And thou too, gay seducer, art thou fled?"
1680,A SKETCH.,
1681,A SKETCH.,"Though vain thy promise, and the suit severe,"
1682,A SKETCH.,"Yet thou couldst guile Misfortune of her tear,"
1683,A SKETCH.,And oft thy smiles across life's gloomy way
1684,A SKETCH.,Could throw a gleam of transitory day.
1685,A SKETCH.,"How gay, in youth, the flattering future seems;"
1686,A SKETCH.,How sweet is manhood in the infant's dreams;
1687,A SKETCH.,The dire mistake too soon is brought to light.
1688,A SKETCH.,And all is buried in redoubled night.
1689,A SKETCH.,"Yet some can rise superior to the pain,"
1690,A SKETCH.,And in their breasts the charmer Hope retain;
1691,A SKETCH.,"While others, dead to feeling, can survey,"
1692,A SKETCH.,"Unmoved, their fairest prospects fade away:"
1693,A SKETCH.,"But yet a few there be,--too soon o'ercast!"
1694,A SKETCH.,"Who shrink unhappy from the adverse blast,"
1695,A SKETCH.,"And woo the first bright gleam, which breaks the gloom,"
1696,A SKETCH.,To gild the silent slumbers of the tomb.
1697,A SKETCH.,"So in these shades the early primrose blows,"
1698,A SKETCH.,Too soon deceived by suns and melting snows:
1699,A SKETCH.,"So falls untimely on the desert waste,"
1700,A SKETCH.,Its blossoms withering in the northern blast.
1701,A SKETCH.,
1702,A SKETCH.,"Now pass'd whate'er the upland heights display,"
1703,A SKETCH.,Down the steep cliff I wind my devious way;
1704,A SKETCH.,"Oft rousing, as the rustling path I beat,"
1705,A SKETCH.,The timid hare from its accustom'd seat.
1706,A SKETCH.,"And oh! how sweet this walk o'erhung with wood,"
1707,A SKETCH.,That winds the margin of the solemn flood!
1708,A SKETCH.,What rural objects steal upon the sight!
1709,A SKETCH.,What rising views prolong the calm delight!
1710,A SKETCH.,
1711,A SKETCH.,"The brooklet branching from the silver Trent,"
1712,A SKETCH.,"The whispering birch by every zephyr bent,"
1713,A SKETCH.,"The woody island, and the naked mead,"
1714,A SKETCH.,"The lowly hut half hid in groves of reed,"
1715,A SKETCH.,"The rural wicket, and the rural stile,"
1716,A SKETCH.,"And frequent interspersed, the woodman's pile."
1717,A SKETCH.,"Above, below, where'er I turn my eyes,"
1718,A SKETCH.,"Rocks, waters, woods, in grand succession rise."
1719,A SKETCH.,"High up the cliff the varied groves ascend,"
1720,A SKETCH.,And mournful larches o'er the wave impend.
1721,A SKETCH.,"Around, what sounds, what magic sounds arise,"
1722,A SKETCH.,What glimmering scenes salute my ravish'd eyes!
1723,A SKETCH.,"Soft sleep the waters on their pebbly bed,"
1724,A SKETCH.,The woods wave gently o'er my drooping head.
1725,A SKETCH.,"And, swelling slow, comes wafted on the wind,"
1726,A SKETCH.,Lorn Progne's note from distant copse behind.
1727,A SKETCH.,Still every rising sound of calm delight
1728,A SKETCH.,"Stamps but the fearful silence of the night,"
1729,A SKETCH.,"Save when is heard between each dreary rest,"
1730,A SKETCH.,"Discordant from her solitary nest,"
1731,A SKETCH.,"The owl, dull screaming to the wandering moon;"
1732,A SKETCH.,"Now riding, cloud-wrapp'd, near her highest noon:"
1733,A SKETCH.,"Or when the wild duck, southering, hither rides,"
1734,A SKETCH.,"And plunges, sullen in the sounding tides."
1735,A SKETCH.,
1736,A SKETCH.,"How oft, in this sequester'd spot, when youth"
1737,A SKETCH.,"Gave to each tale the holy force of truth,"
1738,A SKETCH.,"Have I long linger'd, while the milkmaid sung"
1739,A SKETCH.,"The tragic legend, till the woodland rung!"
1740,A SKETCH.,"That tale, so sad! which, still to memory dear,"
1741,A SKETCH.,"From its sweet source can call the sacred tear,"
1742,A SKETCH.,And (lull'd to rest stern Reason's harsh control)
1743,A SKETCH.,Steal its soft magic to the passive soul.
1744,A SKETCH.,"These hallow'd shades,--these trees that woo the wind,"
1745,A SKETCH.,Recall its faintest features to my mind.
1746,A SKETCH.,"A hundred passing years, with march sublime,"
1747,A SKETCH.,"Have swept beneath the silent wing of time,"
1748,A SKETCH.,"Since, in yon hamlet's solitary shade,"
1749,A SKETCH.,"Reclusely dwelt the far famed Clifton Maid,"
1750,A SKETCH.,The beauteous Margaret; for her each swain
1751,A SKETCH.,"Confess'd in private his peculiar pain,"
1752,A SKETCH.,"In secret sigh'd, a victim to despair,"
1753,A SKETCH.,Nor dared to hope to win the peerless fair.
1754,A SKETCH.,No more the Shepherd on the blooming mead
1755,A SKETCH.,"Attuned to gaiety his artless reed,"
1756,A SKETCH.,"No more entwined the pansied wreath, to deck"
1757,A SKETCH.,"His favourite wether's unpolluted neck,"
1758,A SKETCH.,"But listless, by yon bubbling stream reclined,"
1759,A SKETCH.,"He mix'd his sobbings with the passing wind,"
1760,A SKETCH.,"Bemoan'd his hapless love; or, boldly bent,"
1761,A SKETCH.,"Far from these smiling fields a rover went,"
1762,A SKETCH.,"O'er distant lands, in search of ease, to roam,"
1763,A SKETCH.,A self-will'd exile from his native home.
1764,A SKETCH.,
1765,A SKETCH.,Yet not to all the maid express'd disdain;
1766,A SKETCH.,"Her Bateman loved, nor loved the youth in vain."
1767,A SKETCH.,"Full oft, low whispering o'er these arching boughs,"
1768,A SKETCH.,"The echoing vault responded to their vows,"
1769,A SKETCH.,"As here deep hidden from the glare of day,"
1770,A SKETCH.,"Enamour'd oft, they took their secret way."
1771,A SKETCH.,
1772,A SKETCH.,"Yon bosky dingle, still the rustics name;"
1773,A SKETCH.,'T was there the blushing maid confessed her flame.
1774,A SKETCH.,"Down yon green lane they oft were seen to hie,"
1775,A SKETCH.,When evening slumber'd on the western sky.
1776,A SKETCH.,"That blasted yew, that mouldering walnut bare."
1777,A SKETCH.,Each bears mementos of the fated pair.
1778,A SKETCH.,
1779,A SKETCH.,"One eve, when Autumn loaded every breeze"
1780,A SKETCH.,"With the fallen honours of the mourning trees,"
1781,A SKETCH.,The maiden waited at the accustom'd bower.
1782,A SKETCH.,"And waited long beyond the appointed hour,"
1783,A SKETCH.,"Yet Bateman came not;--o'er the woodland drear,"
1784,A SKETCH.,Howling portentous did the winds career;
1785,A SKETCH.,And bleak and dismal on the leafless woods
1786,A SKETCH.,The fitful rains rush'd down in sullen floods;
1787,A SKETCH.,"The night was dark; as, now and then, the gale"
1788,A SKETCH.,Paused for a moment--Margaret listen'd pale;
1789,A SKETCH.,But through the covert to her anxious ear
1790,A SKETCH.,No rustling footstep spoke her lover near.
1791,A SKETCH.,"Strange fears now fill'd her breast,--she knew not why,"
1792,A SKETCH.,"She sigh'd, and Bateman's name was in each sigh."
1793,A SKETCH.,"She hears a noise,--'t is he,--he comes at last,--"
1794,A SKETCH.,Alas! 't was but the gale which hurried past:
1795,A SKETCH.,"But now she hears a quickening footstep sound,"
1796,A SKETCH.,"Lightly it comes, and nearer does it bound;"
1797,A SKETCH.,"'T is Bateman's self,--he springs into her arms,"
1798,A SKETCH.,"'T is he that clasps, and chides her vain alarms."
1799,A SKETCH.,"""Yet why this silence?--I have waited long,"
1800,A SKETCH.,And the cold storm has yell'd the trees among.
1801,A SKETCH.,
1802,A SKETCH.,"And now thou'rt here my fears are fled--yet speak,"
1803,A SKETCH.,Why does the salt tear moisten on thy cheek?
1804,A SKETCH.,"Say, what is wrong?"" Now through a parting cloud"
1805,A SKETCH.,"The pale moon peer'd from her tempestuous shroud,"
1806,A SKETCH.,"And Bateman's face was seen; 't was deadly white,"
1807,A SKETCH.,And sorrow seem'd to sicken in his sight.
1808,A SKETCH.,"""Oh, speak! my love!"" again the maid conjured,"
1809,A SKETCH.,"""Why is thy heart in sullen woe immured?"""
1810,A SKETCH.,"He raised his head, and thrice essay'd to tell,"
1811,A SKETCH.,Thrice from his lips the unfinished accents fell;
1812,A SKETCH.,When thus at last reluctantly he broke
1813,A SKETCH.,"His boding silence, and the maid bespoke:"
1814,A SKETCH.,"""Grieve not, my love, but ere the morn advance"
1815,A SKETCH.,I on these fields must cast my parting glance;
1816,A SKETCH.,"For three long years, by cruel fate's command,"
1817,A SKETCH.,I go to languish in a foreign land.
1818,A SKETCH.,"Oh, Margaret! omens dire have met my view,"
1819,A SKETCH.,"Say, when far distant, wilt thou bear me true?"
1820,A SKETCH.,"Should honours tempt thee, and should riches fee,"
1821,A SKETCH.,"Wouldst thou forget thine ardent vows to me,"
1822,A SKETCH.,"And on the silken couch of wealth reclined,"
1823,A SKETCH.,"Banish thy faithful Bateman from thy mind?"""
1824,A SKETCH.,
1825,A SKETCH.,"""Oh! why,"" replies the maid, ""my faith thus prove,"
1826,A SKETCH.,"Canst thou! ah, canst thou, then suspect my love?"
1827,A SKETCH.,"Hear me, just God! if from my traitorous heart"
1828,A SKETCH.,"My Bateman's fond remembrance e'er shall part,"
1829,A SKETCH.,"If, when he hail again his native shore,"
1830,A SKETCH.,"He finds his Margaret true to him no more,"
1831,A SKETCH.,"May fiends of hell, and every power of dread,"
1832,A SKETCH.,"Conjoin'd then drag me from my perjured bed,"
1833,A SKETCH.,"And hurl me headlong down these awful steeps,"
1834,A SKETCH.,"To find deserved death in yonder deeps!""[2]"
1835,A SKETCH.,"Thus spake the maid, and from her finger drew"
1836,A SKETCH.,"A golden ring, and broke it quick in two;"
1837,A SKETCH.,"One half she in her lovely bosom hides,"
1838,A SKETCH.,"The other, trembling, to her love confides."
1839,A SKETCH.,"""This bind the vow,"" she said, ""this mystic charm"
1840,A SKETCH.,"No future recantation can disarm,"
1841,A SKETCH.,"The right vindictive does the fates involve,"
1842,A SKETCH.,"No tears can move it, no regrets dissolve."""
1843,A SKETCH.,
1844,A SKETCH.,"She ceased. The death-bird gave a dismal cry,"
1845,A SKETCH.,"The river moan'd, the wild gale whistled by,"
1846,A SKETCH.,And once again the lady of the night
1847,A SKETCH.,Behind a heavy cloud withdrew her light.
1848,A SKETCH.,Trembling she view'd these portents with dismay;
1849,A SKETCH.,But gently Bateman kiss'd her fears away:
1850,A SKETCH.,"Yet still he felt conceal'd a secret smart,"
1851,A SKETCH.,Still melancholy bodings fill'd his heart.
1852,A SKETCH.,
1853,A SKETCH.,"When to the distant land the youth was sped,"
1854,A SKETCH.,A lonely life the moody maiden led.
1855,A SKETCH.,"Still would she trace each dear, each well known walk,"
1856,A SKETCH.,"Still by the moonlight to her love would talk,"
1857,A SKETCH.,"And fancy, as she paced among the trees,"
1858,A SKETCH.,She heard his whispers in the dying breeze.
1859,A SKETCH.,
1860,A SKETCH.,Thus two years glided on in silent grief;
1861,A SKETCH.,The third her bosom own'd the kind relief:
1862,A SKETCH.,Absence had cool'd her love--the impoverish'd flame
1863,A SKETCH.,"Was dwindling fast, when lo! the tempter came;"
1864,A SKETCH.,"He offered wealth, and all the joys of life,"
1865,A SKETCH.,And the weak maid became another's wife!
1866,A SKETCH.,"Six guilty months had mark'd the false one's crime,"
1867,A SKETCH.,When Bateman hail'd once more his native clime.
1868,A SKETCH.,"Sure of her constancy, elate he came,"
1869,A SKETCH.,The lovely partner of his soul to claim;
1870,A SKETCH.,"Light was his heart, as up the well known way"
1871,A SKETCH.,He bent his steps--and all his thoughts were gay.
1872,A SKETCH.,"Oh! who can paint his agonizing throes,"
1873,A SKETCH.,When on his ear the fatal news arose!
1874,A SKETCH.,"Chill'd with amazement,--senseless with the blow,"
1875,A SKETCH.,He stood a marble monument of woe;
1876,A SKETCH.,"Till call'd to all the horrors of despair,"
1877,A SKETCH.,"He smote his brow, and tore his horrent hair;"
1878,A SKETCH.,"Then rush'd impetuous from the dreadful spot,"
1879,A SKETCH.,"And sought those scenes (by memory ne'er forgot),"
1880,A SKETCH.,"Those scenes, the witness of their growing flame,"
1881,A SKETCH.,And now like witnesses of Margaret's shame.
1882,A SKETCH.,"'T was night--he sought the river's lonely shore,"
1883,A SKETCH.,And traced again their former wanderings o'er.
1884,A SKETCH.,"Now on the bank in silent grief he stood,"
1885,A SKETCH.,"And gazed intently on the stealing flood,"
1886,A SKETCH.,"Death in his mein and madness in his eye,"
1887,A SKETCH.,He watch'd the waters as they murmur'd by;
1888,A SKETCH.,Bade the base murderess triumph o'er his grave--
1889,A SKETCH.,Prepared to plunge into the whelming wave.
1890,A SKETCH.,
1891,A SKETCH.,"Yet still he stood irresolutely bent,"
1892,A SKETCH.,Religion sternly stay'd his rash intent.
1893,A SKETCH.,"He knelt.--Cool play'd upon his cheek the wind,"
1894,A SKETCH.,"And fann'd the fever of his maddening mind,"
1895,A SKETCH.,"The willows waved, the stream it sweetly swept,"
1896,A SKETCH.,"The paly moonbeam on its surface slept,"
1897,A SKETCH.,And all was peace;--he felt the general calm
1898,A SKETCH.,O'er his rack'd bosom shed a genial balm:
1899,A SKETCH.,"When casting far behind his streaming eye,"
1900,A SKETCH.,"He saw the Grove,--in fancy saw her lie,"
1901,A SKETCH.,"His Margaret, lull'd in Germain's[3] arms to rest,"
1902,A SKETCH.,And all the demon rose within his breast.
1903,A SKETCH.,"Convulsive now, he clench'd his trembling hand,"
1904,A SKETCH.,"Cast his dark eye once more upon the land,"
1905,A SKETCH.,"Then, at one spring he spurn'd the yielding bank,"
1906,A SKETCH.,And in the calm deceitful current sank.
1907,A SKETCH.,
1908,A SKETCH.,"Sad, on the solitude of night, the sound,"
1909,A SKETCH.,"As in the stream he plunged, was heard around:"
1910,A SKETCH.,"Then all was still--the wave was rough no more,"
1911,A SKETCH.,The river swept as sweetly as before;
1912,A SKETCH.,"The willows waved, the moonbeams shone serene,"
1913,A SKETCH.,And peace returning brooded o'er the scene.
1914,A SKETCH.,
1915,A SKETCH.,"Now, see upon the perjured fair one hang"
1916,A SKETCH.,Remorse's glooms and never ceasing pang.
1917,A SKETCH.,"Full well she knew, repentant now too late,"
1918,A SKETCH.,She soon must bow beneath the stroke of fate.
1919,A SKETCH.,"But, for the babe she bore beneath her breast,"
1920,A SKETCH.,The offended God prolong'd her life unbless'd.
1921,A SKETCH.,"But fast the fleeting moments roll'd away,"
1922,A SKETCH.,And near and nearer drew the dreaded day;
1923,A SKETCH.,"That day foredoom'd to give her child the light,"
1924,A SKETCH.,And hurl its mother to the shades of night.
1925,A SKETCH.,"The hour arrived, and from the wretched wife"
1926,A SKETCH.,The guiltless baby struggled into life.--
1927,A SKETCH.,"As night drew on, around her bed a band"
1928,A SKETCH.,Of friends and kindred kindly took their stand;
1929,A SKETCH.,"In holy prayer they pass'd the creeping time,"
1930,A SKETCH.,Intent to expiate her awful crime.
1931,A SKETCH.,Their prayers were fruitless.--As the midnight came
1932,A SKETCH.,A heavy sleep oppress'd each weary frame.
1933,A SKETCH.,"In vain they strove against the o'erwhelming load,"
1934,A SKETCH.,Some power unseen their drowsy lids bestrode.
1935,A SKETCH.,They slept till in the blushing eastern sky
1936,A SKETCH.,The blooming Morning oped her dewy eye;
1937,A SKETCH.,"Then wakening wide they sought the ravish'd bed,"
1938,A SKETCH.,But lo! the hapless Margaret was fled;
1939,A SKETCH.,And never more the weeping train were doom'd
1940,A SKETCH.,"To view the false one, in the deeps intomb'd."
1941,A SKETCH.,
1942,A SKETCH.,The neighbouring rustics told that in the night
1943,A SKETCH.,They heard such screams as froze them with affright;
1944,A SKETCH.,"And many an infant, at its mother's breast,"
1945,A SKETCH.,"Started dismay'd, from its unthinking rest."
1946,A SKETCH.,"And even now, upon the heath forlorn,"
1947,A SKETCH.,"They show the path down which the fair was borne,"
1948,A SKETCH.,"By the fell demons, to the yawning wave,"
1949,A SKETCH.,"Her own, and murder'd lover's, mutual grave."
1950,A SKETCH.,
1951,A SKETCH.,"Such is the tale, so sad, to memory dear,"
1952,A SKETCH.,"Which oft in youth has charm'd my listening ear,"
1953,A SKETCH.,"That tale, which bade me find redoubled sweets"
1954,A SKETCH.,In the drear silence of these dark retreats;
1955,A SKETCH.,"And even now, with melancholy power,"
1956,A SKETCH.,Adds a new pleasure to the lonely hour.
1957,A SKETCH.,'Mid all the charms by magic Nature given
1958,A SKETCH.,"To this wild spot, this sublunary heaven,"

1960,A SKETCH.,On the attendant legend of the scenes.
1961,A SKETCH.,"This sheds a fairy lustre on the floods,"
1962,A SKETCH.,And breathes a mellower gloom upon the woods;
1963,A SKETCH.,"This, as the distant cataract swells around,"
1964,A SKETCH.,Gives a romantic cadence to the sound;
1965,A SKETCH.,"This, and the deepening glen, the alley green,"
1966,A SKETCH.,"The silver stream, with sedgy tufts between,"
1967,A SKETCH.,"The massy rock, the wood-encompass'd leas,"
1968,A SKETCH.,"The broom-clad islands, and the nodding trees,"
1969,A SKETCH.,"The lengthening vista, and the present gloom,"

1981,A SKETCH.,Or stand entranced with Pyrenean views;
1982,A SKETCH.,"Still, still to thee, where'er my footsteps roam,"
1983,A SKETCH.,"My heart shall point, and lead the wanderer home."
1984,A SKETCH.,"When Splendour offers, and when Fame incites,"

1992,A SKETCH.,"But if the Fates should this last wish deny,"
1993,A SKETCH.,And doom me on some foreign shore to die;
1994,A SKETCH.,"Oh! should it please the world's supernal King,"
1995,A SKETCH.,That weltering waves my funeral dirge shall sing;
1996,A SKETCH.,"Or that my corse should, on some desert strand,"
1997,A SKETCH.,Lie stretch'd beneath the Simoom's blasting hand;
1998,A SKETCH.,"Still, though unwept I find a stranger tomb,"
1999,A SKETCH.,"My sprite shall wander through this favourite gloom,"

2155,A POEM.[1],Yet in the interim what mighty shocks
2156,A POEM.[1],Have buffeted mankind--whole nations razed--
2157,A POEM.[1],Cities made desolate--the polish'd sunk
2158,A POEM.[1],"To barbarism, and once barbaric states"
2159,A POEM.[1],Swaying the wand of science and of arts;
2160,A POEM.[1],Illustrious deeds and memorable names
2161,A POEM.[1],"Blotted from record, and upon the tongue"
2162,A POEM.[1],"Of gray Tradition, voluble no more."
2163,A POEM.[1],
2164,A POEM.[1],Where are the heroes of the ages past?
2165,A POEM.[1],"Where the brave chieftains, where the mighty ones"
2166,A POEM.[1],Who flourish'd in the infancy of days?
2167,A POEM.[1],All to the grave gone down. On their fallen fame
2168,A POEM.[1],"Exultant, mocking at the pride of man,"
2169,A POEM.[1],Sits grim Forgetfulness.--The warrior's arm
2170,A POEM.[1],Lies nerveless on the pillow of its shame;
2171,A POEM.[1],"Hush'd is his stormy voice, and quench'd the blaze"
2172,A POEM.[1],Of his red eyeball.--Yesterday his name
2173,A POEM.[1],Was mighty on the earth.--To-day--'t is what?
2174,A POEM.[1],"The meteor of the night of distant years,"
2175,A POEM.[1],"That flash'd unnoticed, save by wrinkled eld,"
2176,A POEM.[1],"Musing at midnight upon prophecies,"
2177,A POEM.[1],Who at her lonely lattice saw the gleam
2178,A POEM.[1],"Point to the mist-poised shroud, then quietly"
2179,A POEM.[1],"Closed her pale lips, and lock'd the secret up"
2180,A POEM.[1],Safe in the enamel's treasures.
2181,A POEM.[1],
2182,A POEM.[1],Oh how weak
2183,A POEM.[1],Is mortal man! how trifling--how confined
2184,A POEM.[1],"His scope of vision! Puff'd with confidence,"
2185,A POEM.[1],"His phrase grows big with immortality,"
2186,A POEM.[1],"And he, poor insect of a summer's day!"

2200,A POEM.[1],Of the fallen fabric of the other day
2201,A POEM.[1],Preaches the solemn lesson.--He should know

2204,A POEM.[1],"Fades in the lapse of ages, and expires."
2205,A POEM.[1],Who lies inhumed in the terrific gloom
2206,A POEM.[1],Of the gigantic pyramid? or who

2213,A POEM.[1],She lives but in the tale of other times;
2214,A POEM.[1],"Her proud pavilions are the hermit's home,"
2215,A POEM.[1],"And her long colonnades, her public walks,"
2216,A POEM.[1],"Now faintly echo to the pilgrim's feet,"
2217,A POEM.[1],"Who comes to muse in solitude, and trace,"
2218,A POEM.[1],"Through the rank moss reveal'd, her honour'd dust."
2219,A POEM.[1],But not to Rome alone has fate confined
2220,A POEM.[1],"The doom of ruin; cities numberless,"
2221,A POEM.[1],"Tyre, Sidon, Carthage, Babylon, and Troy,"
2222,A POEM.[1],"And rich Phoenicia--they are blotted out,"
2223,A POEM.[1],"Half razed from memory, and their very name"
2224,A POEM.[1],And being in dispute.--Has Athens fallen?
2225,A POEM.[1],Is polish'd Greece become the savage seat
2226,A POEM.[1],Of ignorance and sloth? and shall we dare

2233,A POEM.[1],"Some second Vandal hath reduced her pride,"
2234,A POEM.[1],And with one big recoil hath thrown her back
2235,A POEM.[1],"To primitive barbarity.----Again,"
2236,A POEM.[1],"Through her depopulated vales, the scream"
2237,A POEM.[1],"Of bloody Superstition hollow rings,"
2238,A POEM.[1],And the scared native to the tempest howls
2239,A POEM.[1],"The yell of deprecation. O'er her marts,"
2240,A POEM.[1],"Her crowded ports, broods Silence; and the cry"
2241,A POEM.[1],"Of the low curlew, and the pensive dash"
2242,A POEM.[1],"Of distant billows, breaks alone the void;"
2243,A POEM.[1],Even as the savage sits upon the stone
2244,A POEM.[1],"That marks where stood her capitols, and hears"
2245,A POEM.[1],"The bittern booming in the weeds, he shrinks"
2246,A POEM.[1],From the dismaying solitude.--Her bards
2247,A POEM.[1],Sing in a language that hath perished;
2248,A POEM.[1],"And their wild harps suspended o'er their graves,"
2249,A POEM.[1],Sigh to the desert winds a dying strain.
2250,A POEM.[1],
2251,A POEM.[1],"Meanwhile the Arts, in second infancy,"

2257,A POEM.[1],Of fallen Albion.--To the land unknown
2258,A POEM.[1],He journeys joyful; and perhaps descries
2259,A POEM.[1],Some vestige of her ancient stateliness:
2260,A POEM.[1],"Then he, with vain conjecture, fills his mind"
2261,A POEM.[1],"Of the unheard-of race, which had arrived"

2266,A POEM.[1],"Still on its march, unnoticed and unfelt,"
2267,A POEM.[1],"Moves on our being. We do live and breathe,"

2269,A POEM.[1],We have our springtime and our rottenness;
2270,A POEM.[1],"And as we fall, another race succeeds,"
2271,A POEM.[1],To perish likewise.--Meanwhile Nature smiles--

2273,A POEM.[1],His annual course--and heaven and earth remain
2274,A POEM.[1],"Still changing, yet unchanged--still doom'd to feel"
2275,A POEM.[1],Endless mutation in perpetual rest.
2276,A POEM.[1],Where are conceal'd the days which have elapsed?

2286,A POEM.[1],"Of utter silence, it is fearful then"
2287,A POEM.[1],"To steer the mind, in deadly solitude."
2288,A POEM.[1],Up the vague stream of probability;
2289,A POEM.[1],"To wind the mighty secrets of the past,"
2290,A POEM.[1],And turn the key of time!--Oh! who can strive
2291,A POEM.[1],"To comprehend the vast, the awful truth,"
2292,A POEM.[1],"Of the eternity that hath gone by,"
2293,A POEM.[1],And not recoil from the dismaying sense
2294,A POEM.[1],Of human impotence? The life of man
2295,A POEM.[1],Is summ'd in birthdays and in sepulchres;
2296,A POEM.[1],But the Eternal God had no beginning;
2297,A POEM.[1],He hath no end. Time had been with him
2298,A POEM.[1],"For everlasting, ere the dredal world"
2299,A POEM.[1],Rose from the gulf in loveliness.--Like him
2300,A POEM.[1],"It knew no source, like him, 't was uncreate."
2301,A POEM.[1],What is it then? The past Eternity!
2302,A POEM.[1],We comprehend a future without end;

2304,A POEM.[1],May roll for ever: but we shrink amazed--
2305,A POEM.[1],"We stand aghast, when we reflect that time"
2306,A POEM.[1],"Knew no commencement.--That heap age on age,"
2307,A POEM.[1],"And million upon million, without end,"
2308,A POEM.[1],And we shall never span the void of days
2309,A POEM.[1],That were and are not but in retrospect.
2310,A POEM.[1],"The Past is an unfathomable depth,"
2311,A POEM.[1],Beyond the span of thought; 'tis an elapse

2321,A POEM.[1],"Are to his being as a day, and days"
2322,A POEM.[1],"As centuries.--Time past, and Time to come,"
2323,A POEM.[1],Are always equal; when the world began
2324,A POEM.[1],God had existed from eternity.
2325,A POEM.[1],
2326,A POEM.[1],*        *        *        *        *
2327,A POEM.[1],
2328,A POEM.[1],Now look on man
2329,A POEM.[1],Myriads of ages hence.--Hath time elapsed?
2330,A POEM.[1],Is he not standing in the selfsame place
2331,A POEM.[1],Where once we stood?--The same eternity
2332,A POEM.[1],"Hath gone before him, and is yet to come;"
2333,A POEM.[1],"His past is not of longer span than ours,"
2334,A POEM.[1],Though myriads of ages intervened;
2335,A POEM.[1],"For who can add to what has neither sum,"
2336,A POEM.[1],"Nor bound, nor source, nor estimate, nor end?"
2337,A POEM.[1],"Oh, who can compass the Almighty mind?"
2338,A POEM.[1],Who can unlock the secrets of the high?
2339,A POEM.[1],In speculations of an altitude
2340,A POEM.[1],"Sublime as this, our reason stands confess'd"
2341,A POEM.[1],"Foolish, and insignificant, and mean."
2342,A POEM.[1],Who can apply the futile argument
2343,A POEM.[1],Of finite beings to infinity?
2344,A POEM.[1],
2345,A POEM.[1],He might as well compress the universe
2346,A POEM.[1],"Into the hollow compass of a gourd,"
2347,A POEM.[1],Scoop'd out by human art; or bid the whale
2348,A POEM.[1],Drink up the sea it swims in!--Can the less
2349,A POEM.[1],Contain the greater? or the dark obscure
2350,A POEM.[1],Infold the glories of meridian day?
2351,A POEM.[1],What does philosophy impart to man
2352,A POEM.[1],But undiscovered wonders?--Let her soar
2353,A POEM.[1],Even to her proudest heights--to where she caught
2354,A POEM.[1],"The soul of Newton and of Socrates,"
2355,A POEM.[1],She but extends the scope of wild amaze
2356,A POEM.[1],And admiration. All her lessons end
2357,A POEM.[1],In wider views of God's unfathom'd depths.
2358,A POEM.[1],
2359,A POEM.[1],"Lo! the unletter'd hind, who never knew"
2360,A POEM.[1],To raise his mind excursive to the heights
2361,A POEM.[1],"Of abstract contemplation, as he sits"
2362,A POEM.[1],"On the green hillock by the hedge-row side,"
2363,A POEM.[1],"What time the insect swarms are murmuring,"
2364,A POEM.[1],"And marks, in silent thought, the broken clouds"

2366,A POEM.[1],Feels in his soul the hand of Nature rouse
2367,A POEM.[1],"The thrill of gratitude, to him who form'd"
2368,A POEM.[1],The goodly prospect; he beholds the God
2369,A POEM.[1],"Throned in the west, and his reposing ear"
2370,A POEM.[1],Hears sounds angelic in the fitful breeze
2371,A POEM.[1],"That floats through neighbouring copse or fairy brake,"
2372,A POEM.[1],Or lingers playful on the haunted stream.
2373,A POEM.[1],"Go with the cotter to his winter fire,"
2374,A POEM.[1],"Where o'er the moors the loud blast whistles shrill,"
2375,A POEM.[1],And the hoarse ban-dog bays the icy moon;
2376,A POEM.[1],Mark with what awe he lists the wild uproar.
2377,A POEM.[1],"Silent, and big with thought; and hear him bless"
2378,A POEM.[1],"The God that rides on the tempestuous clouds,"
2379,A POEM.[1],"For his snug hearth, and all his little joys:"

2383,A POEM.[1],"Beats in his face, and, dubious of his path,"
2384,A POEM.[1],"He stops, and thinks, in every lengthening blast,"
2385,A POEM.[1],"He hears some village mastiff's distant howl,"
2386,A POEM.[1],"And sees, far streaming, some lone cottage light;"
2387,A POEM.[1],"Then, undeceived, upturns his streaming eyes,"
2388,A POEM.[1],"And clasps his shivering hands; or overpowered,"
2389,A POEM.[1],"Sinks on the frozen ground, weigh'd down with sleep,"
2390,A POEM.[1],From which the hapless wretch shall never wake.
2391,A POEM.[1],Thus the poor rustic warms his heart with praise
2392,A POEM.[1],"And glowing gratitude,--he turns to bless,"
2393,A POEM.[1],"With honest warmth, his Maker and his God!"
2394,A POEM.[1],"And shall it e'er be said, that a poor hind,"
2395,A POEM.[1],"Nursed in the lap of Ignorance, and bred"
2396,A POEM.[1],"In want and labour, glows with nobler zeal"
2397,A POEM.[1],"To laud his Maker's attributes, while he"

2408,A POEM.[1],"Who kneels to sun or moon, compared with him"
2409,A POEM.[1],"Who thus perverts the talents he enjoys,"
2410,A POEM.[1],Is the most bless'd of men! Oh! I would walk
2411,A POEM.[1],"A weary journey, to the furthest verge"
2412,A POEM.[1],"Of the big world, to kiss that good man's hand,"
2413,A POEM.[1],"Who, in the blaze of wisdom and of art,"
2414,A POEM.[1],"Preserves a lowly mind; and to his God,"
2415,A POEM.[1],"Feeling the sense of his own littleness,"

2428,A POEM.[1],"Ages and epochs that destroy our pride,"
2429,A POEM.[1],"And then record its downfall, what are they"
2430,A POEM.[1],But the poor creatures of man's teeming brain?
2431,A POEM.[1],Hath Heaven its ages? or doth Heaven preserve
2432,A POEM.[1],Its stated eras? Doth the Omnipotent
2433,A POEM.[1],Hear of to-morrows or of yesterdays?
2434,A POEM.[1],There is to God nor future nor a past;

2872,PART I.,Beloved moment! then 'twas first I caught
2873,PART I.,The first foundation of romantic thought!
2874,PART I.,"Then first I shed bold Fancy's thrilling tear,"
2875,PART I.,Then first that poesy charm'd mine infant ear.
2876,PART I.,"Soon stored with much of legendary lore,"
2877,PART I.,The sports of childhood charm'd my soul no more.
2878,PART I.,"Far from the scene of gaiety and noise,"
2879,PART I.,"Far, far from turbulent and empty joys,"
2880,PART I.,"I hied me to the thick overarching shade,"
2881,PART I.,"And there, on mossy carpet, listless laid,"
2882,PART I.,"While at my feet the rippling runnel ran,"
2883,PART I.,The days of wild romance antique I'd scan;
2884,PART I.,"Soar on the wings of fancy through the air,"
2885,PART I.,"To realms of light, and pierce the radiance there."

2891,PART II.,There are who think that Childhood does not share
2892,PART II.,"With age the cup, the bitter cup, of care:"
2893,PART II.,"Alas! they know not this unhappy truth,"
2894,PART II.,"That every age, and rank, is born to ruth."
2895,PART II.,
2896,PART II.,"From the first dawn of reason in the mind,"
2897,PART II.,Man is foredoomed the thorns of grief to find;
2898,PART II.,At every step has farther cause to know
2899,PART II.,The draught of pleasure still is dash'd with woe.
2900,PART II.,
2901,PART II.,"Yet in the youthful breast, for ever caught"
2902,PART II.,"With some new object for romantic thought,"
2903,PART II.,"The impression of the moment quickly flies,"
2904,PART II.,And with the morrow every sorrow dies.
2905,PART II.,
2906,PART II.,How different manhood!--then does Thought's control
2907,PART II.,Sink every pang still deeper in the soul;
2908,PART II.,Then keen Affliction's sad unceasing smart
2909,PART II.,Becomes a painful resident in the heart;
2910,PART II.,"And care, whom not the gayest can outbrave,"
2911,PART II.,Pursues its feeble victim to the grave.
2912,PART II.,"Then, as each long known friend is summon'd hence,"
2913,PART II.,"We feel a void no joy can recompense,"
2914,PART II.,"And as we weep o'er every new-made tomb,"
2915,PART II.,Wish that ourselves the next may meet our doom.

2917,PART II.,"Yes, Childhood, thee no rankling woes pursue,"

2923,PART II.,"Yet e'en round childhood's heart, a thoughtless shrine,"
2924,PART II.,Affection's little thread will ever twine;
2925,PART II.,"And though but frail may seem each tender tie,"
2926,PART II.,The soul foregoes them but with many a sigh.
2927,PART II.,"Thus, when the long expected moment came,"
2928,PART II.,"When forced to leave the gentle-hearted dame,"
2929,PART II.,"Reluctant throbbings rose within my breast,"
2930,PART II.,And a still tear my silent grief express'd.
2931,PART II.,
2932,PART II.,"When to the public school compelled to go,"
2933,PART II.,What novel scenes did on my senses flow?
2934,PART II.,"There in each breast each active power dilates,"
2935,PART II.,"Which 'broils whole nations, and convulses states;"
2936,PART II.,"Their reigns, by turns alternate, love and hate,"
2937,PART II.,"Ambition burns, and factious rebels prate;"
2938,PART II.,"And in a smaller range, a smaller sphere,"
2939,PART II.,The dark deformities of man appear.
2940,PART II.,"Yet there the gentler virtues kindred claim,"
2941,PART II.,"There Friendship lights her pure untainted flame,"
2942,PART II.,"There mild Benevolence delights to dwell,"
2943,PART II.,And sweet Contentment rests without her cell;
2944,PART II.,"And there, 'mid many a stormy soul, we find"
2945,PART II.,"The good of heart, the intelligent of mind."
2946,PART II.,
2947,PART II.,"'T was there, O George! with thee I learn'd to join"
2948,PART II.,In Friendship's bands--in amity divine.
2949,PART II.,"Oh, mournful though!--Where is thy spirit now?"
2950,PART II.,"As here I sit on favorite Logar's brow,"
2951,PART II.,"And trace below each well remember'd glade,"
2952,PART II.,"Where arm in arm, erewhile with thee I stray'd."
2953,PART II.,"Where art thou laid--on what untrodden shore,"
2954,PART II.,Where nought is heard save ocean's sullen roar?
2955,PART II.,"Dost thou in lowly, unlamented state,"
2956,PART II.,At last repose from all the storms of fate?
2957,PART II.,"Methinks I see thee struggling with the wave,"
2958,PART II.,Without one aiding hand stretch'd out to save;
2959,PART II.,"See thee convulsed, thy looks to heaven bend,"
2960,PART II.,And send thy parting sigh unto thy friend:
2961,PART II.,"Or where immeasurable wilds dismay,"
2962,PART II.,"Forlorn and sad thou bend'st thy weary way,"
2963,PART II.,"While sorrow and disease, with anguish rife,"
2964,PART II.,Consume apace the ebbing springs of life.
2965,PART II.,"Again I see his door against thee shut,"
2966,PART II.,The unfeeling native turn thee from his hut;
2967,PART II.,"I see thee, spent with toil and worn with grief,"
2968,PART II.,"Sit on the grass, and wish the long'd relief;"
2969,PART II.,"Then lie thee down, the stormy struggle o'er,"
2970,PART II.,Think on thy native land--and rise no more!
2971,PART II.,
2972,PART II.,"Oh! that thou couldst, from thine august abode,"
2973,PART II.,"Survey thy friend in life's dismaying road,"
2974,PART II.,"That thou couldst see him, at this moment here,"
2975,PART II.,"Embalm thy memory with a pious tear,"
2976,PART II.,"And hover o'er him as he gazes round,"
2977,PART II.,Where all the scenes of infant joys surround.
2978,PART II.,
2979,PART II.,Yes! yes! his spirit's near!--The whispering breeze
2980,PART II.,Conveys his voice sad sighing on the trees;
2981,PART II.,"And lo! his form transparent I perceive,"
2982,PART II.,Borne on the gray mist of the sullen eve:
2983,PART II.,"He hovers near, clad in the night's dim robe,"
2984,PART II.,While deathly silence reigns upon the globe.
2985,PART II.,
2986,PART II.,Yet ah! whence comes this visionary scene?
2987,PART II.,'T is Fancy's wild aÃ«rial dream I ween:
2988,PART II.,"By her inspired, when reason takes its flight,"
2989,PART II.,What fond illusions beam upon the sight!
2990,PART II.,"She waves her hand, and lo! what forms appear!"
2991,PART II.,What magic sounds salute the wondering ear!
2992,PART II.,"Once more o'er distant regions do we tread,"
2993,PART II.,And the cold grave yields up its cherish'd dead;
2994,PART II.,"While, present sorrows banish'd far away,"
2995,PART II.,"Unclouded azure gilds the placid day,"
2996,PART II.,"Or, in the future's cloud-encircled face,"
2997,PART II.,"Fair scenes of bliss to come we fondly trace,"
2998,PART II.,"And draw minutely every little wile,"
2999,PART II.,Which shall the feathery hours of time beguile.
3000,PART II.,
3001,PART II.,"So when forlorn, and lonesome at her gate,"
3002,PART II.,"The Royal Mary solitary sate,"
3003,PART II.,"And view'd the moonbeam trembling on the wave,"
3004,PART II.,"And heard the hollow surge her prison lave,"
3005,PART II.,"Towards France's distant coast she bent her sight,"
3006,PART II.,For there her soul had wing'd its longing flight;
3007,PART II.,"There did she form full many a scheme of joy,"
3008,PART II.,"Visions of bliss unclouded with alloy,"
3009,PART II.,"Which bright thro' Hope's deceitful optics beam'd,"
3010,PART II.,And all became the surety which it seem'd;
3011,PART II.,"She wept, yet felt, while all within was calm,"
3012,PART II.,In every tear a melancholy charm.
3013,PART II.,
3014,PART II.,"To yonder hill, whose sides, deform'd and steep,"
3015,PART II.,"Just yield a scanty sustenance to the sheep,"
3016,PART II.,"With thee, my friend, I oftentimes have sped,"
3017,PART II.,To see the sun rise from his healthy bed;
3018,PART II.,"To watch the aspect of the summer morn,"
3019,PART II.,"Smiling upon the golden fields of corn,"
3020,PART II.,"And taste, delighted, of superior joys,"
3021,PART II.,Beheld through sympathy's enchanted eyes:
3022,PART II.,With silent admiration oft we view'd
3023,PART II.,The myriad hues o'er heaven's blue concave strew'd;
3024,PART II.,"The fleecy clouds, of every tint and shade,"
3025,PART II.,"Round which the silvery sunbeam glancing play'd,"
3026,PART II.,"And the round orb itself, in azure throne,"
3027,PART II.,Just peeping o'er the blue hill's ridgy zone;
3028,PART II.,"We mark'd delighted, how with aspect gay,"
3029,PART II.,Reviving Nature hail'd returning day;
3030,PART II.,"Mark'd how the flowerets rear'd their drooping heads,"
3031,PART II.,"And the wild lambkins bounded o'er the meads,"
3032,PART II.,"While from each tree, in tones of sweet delight,"
3033,PART II.,The birds sung pasans to the source of light:
3034,PART II.,"Oft have we watch'd the speckled lark arise,"
3035,PART II.,"Leave his grass bed, and soar to kindred skies,"
3036,PART II.,"And rise, and rise, till the pain'd sight no more"
3037,PART II.,Could trace him in his high aÃ«rial tour;
3038,PART II.,"Though on the ear, at intervals, his song"
3039,PART II.,Came wafted slow the wavy breeze along;
3040,PART II.,"And we have thought how happy were our lot,"
3041,PART II.,"Bless'd with some sweet, some solitary cot,"
3042,PART II.,"Where, from the peep of day, till russet eve"
3043,PART II.,"Began in every dell her forms to weave,"
3044,PART II.,"We might pursue our sports from day to day,"
3045,PART II.,And in each other's arms wear life away.
3046,PART II.,
3047,PART II.,"At sultry noon too, when our toils were done,"
3048,PART II.,We to the gloomy glen were wont to run;
3049,PART II.,"There on the turf we lay, while at our feet"
3050,PART II.,The cooling rivulet rippled softly sweet;
3051,PART II.,"And mused on holy theme, and ancient lore,"
3052,PART II.,"Of deeds, and days, and heroes now no more;"
3053,PART II.,"Heard, as his solemn harp Isaiah swept,"
3054,PART II.,Sung woe unto the wicked land--and wept;
3055,PART II.,"Or, fancy-led, saw Jeremiah mourn"
3056,PART II.,In solemn sorrow o'er Judea's urn.
3057,PART II.,"Then to another shore perhaps would rove,"
3058,PART II.,With Plato talk in his Ilyssian grove;
3059,PART II.,"Or, wandering where the Thespian palace rose,"
3060,PART II.,Weep once again o'er fair Jocasta's woes.
3061,PART II.,
3062,PART II.,"Sweet then to us was that romantic band,"
3063,PART II.,The ancient legends of our native land--
3064,PART II.,"Chivalric Britomart, and Una fair,"
3065,PART II.,"And courteous Constance, doom'd to dark despair,"
3066,PART II.,By turns our thoughts engaged; and oft we talk'd
3067,PART II.,"Of times when monarch superstition stalk'd,"
3068,PART II.,And when the blood-fraught galliots of Rome
3069,PART II.,Brought the grand Druid fabric to its doom:
3070,PART II.,"While, where the wood-hung Meinai's waters flow,"
3071,PART II.,The hoary harpers pour'd the strain of woe.
3072,PART II.,
3073,PART II.,"While thus employed, to us how sad the bell"
3074,PART II.,"Which summon'd us to school! 'T was Fancy's knell,"
3075,PART II.,"And, sadly sounding on the sullen ear,"
3076,PART II.,"It spoke of study pale, and chilling fear."
3077,PART II.,"Yet even then, (for oh! what chains can bind,"
3078,PART II.,"What powers control, the energies of mind!)"
3079,PART II.,"E'en then we soar'd to many a height sublime,"
3080,PART II.,And many a day-dream charm'd the lazy time.
3081,PART II.,
3082,PART II.,"At evening too, how pleasing was our walk,"
3083,PART II.,"Endear'd by Friendship's unrestrained talk,"
3084,PART II.,When to the upland heights we bent our way.
3085,PART II.,To view the last beam of departing day;
3086,PART II.,How calm was all around! no playful breeze
3087,PART II.,"Sigh'd 'mid the wavy foliage of the trees,"
3088,PART II.,"But all was still, save when, with drowsy song,"
3089,PART II.,The gray-fly wound his sullen horn along;
3090,PART II.,"And save when, heard in soft, yet merry glee,"
3091,PART II.,The distant church bells' mellow harmony;
3092,PART II.,"The silver mirror of the lucid brook,"
3093,PART II.,That 'mid the tufted broom its still course took;
3094,PART II.,"The rugged arch, that clasp'd its silent tides,"
3095,PART II.,With moss and rank weeds hanging down its sides;
3096,PART II.,"The craggy rock, that jutted on the sight;"
3097,PART II.,"The shrieking bat, that took its heavy flight;"
3098,PART II.,"All, all was pregnant with divine delight."
3099,PART II.,"We loved to watch the swallow swimming high,"
3100,PART II.,In the bright azure of the vaulted sky;
3101,PART II.,"Or gaze upon the clouds, whose colour'd pride"
3102,PART II.,"Was scatter'd thinly o'er the welkin wide,"
3103,PART II.,"And tinged with such variety of shade,"
3104,PART II.,To the charm'd soul sublimest thoughts convey'd.
3105,PART II.,"In these what forms romantic did we trace,"
3106,PART II.,While Fancy led us o'er the realms of space!
3107,PART II.,"Now we espied the Thunderer in his car,"
3108,PART II.,"Leading the embattled seraphim to war,"
3109,PART II.,"Then stately towers descried, sublimely high,"
3110,PART II.,In Gothic grandeur frowning on the sky--
3111,PART II.,"Or saw, wide stretching o'er the azure height,"
3112,PART II.,"A ridge of glaciers in mural white,"
3113,PART II.,"Hugely terrific.--But those times are o'er,"
3114,PART II.,And the fond scene can charm mine eyes no more;
3115,PART II.,"For thou art gone, and I am left below,"
3116,PART II.,Alone to struggle through this world of woe.
3117,PART II.,
3118,PART II.,"The scene is o'er--still seasons onward roll,"
3119,PART II.,And each revolve conducts me toward the goal;
3120,PART II.,"Yet all is blank, without one soft relief,"
3121,PART II.,One endless continuity of grief;
3122,PART II.,"And the tired soul, now led to thoughts sublime,"
3123,PART II.,Looks but for rest beyond the bounds of time.
3124,PART II.,
3125,PART II.,"Toil on, toil on, ye busy crowds, that pant"
3126,PART II.,For hoards of wealth which ye will never want:
3127,PART II.,"And lost to all but gain, with ease resign"
3128,PART II.,The calms of peace and happiness divine!
3129,PART II.,Far other cares be mine--Men little crave
3130,PART II.,In this short journey to the silent grave;
3131,PART II.,"And the poor peasant, bless'd with peace and health,"
3132,PART II.,I envy more than Croesus with his wealth.
3133,PART II.,"Yet grieve not I, that Fate did not decree"
3134,PART II.,Paternal acres to await on me;
3135,PART II.,"She gave me more, she placed within my breast"
3136,PART II.,A heart with little pleased--with little bless'd:
3137,PART II.,"I look around me, where, on every side,"
3138,PART II.,Extensive manors spread in wealthy pride;
3139,PART II.,"And could my sight be borne to either zone,"
3140,PART II.,I should not find one foot of land my own.
3141,PART II.,
3142,PART II.,"But whither do I wander? shall the muse,"
3143,PART II.,"For golden baits, her simple theme refuse?"
3144,PART II.,"Oh, no! but while the weary spirit greets"
3145,PART II.,"The fading scenes of childhood's far gone sweets,"
3146,PART II.,"It catches all the infant's wandering tongue,"
3147,PART II.,And prattles on in desultory song.
3148,PART II.,That song must close--the gloomy mists of night
3149,PART II.,"Obscure the pale stars' visionary light,"
3150,PART II.,"And ebon darkness, clad in vapoury wet,"
3151,PART II.,Steals on the welkin in primÃ¦val jet.
3152,PART II.,
3153,PART II.,The song must close.--Once more my adverse lot
3154,PART II.,Leads me reluctant from this cherish'd spot:
3155,PART II.,"Again compels to plunge in busy life,"
3156,PART II.,And brave the hateful turbulence of strife.
3157,PART II.,
3158,PART II.,Scenes of my youth--ere my unwilling feet
3159,PART II.,Are turn'd for ever from this loved retreat.
3160,PART II.,"Ere on these fields, with plenty cover'd o'er,"
3161,PART II.,"My eyes are closed to ope on them no more,"

3163,PART II.,"One long, one last affectionate adieu."
3164,PART II.,"Grant that, if ever Providence should please"
3165,PART II.,"To give me an old age of peace and ease,"
3166,PART II.,"Grant that, in these sequester'd shades, my days"
3167,PART II.,May wear away in gradual decays:
3168,PART II.,"And oh! ye spirits, who unbodied play,"
3169,PART II.,"Unseen upon the pinions of the day,"

4024,WRITTEN IN THE PROSPECT OF DEATH.,"Of death I feel press heavy on my vitals,"
4025,WRITTEN IN THE PROSPECT OF DEATH.,Slow sapping the warm current of existence.
4026,WRITTEN IN THE PROSPECT OF DEATH.,My moments now are few--the sand of life
4027,WRITTEN IN THE PROSPECT OF DEATH.,"Ebbs fastly to its finish. Yet a little,"

4060,WRITTEN IN THE PROSPECT OF DEATH.,"Nor will the sound, familiar to their ears,"

4062,WRITTEN IN THE PROSPECT OF DEATH.,For better things!--I hoped I should not leave

7741,A BALLAD.,"And all within was dark and drear,"
7742,A BALLAD.,And all without was calm;
7743,A BALLAD.,"Yet Gondoline enter'd, her soul upheld"
7744,A BALLAD.,By some deep-working charm.
7745,A BALLAD.,
7746,A BALLAD.,"And as she enter'd the cavern wide,"
7747,A BALLAD.,"The moonbeam gleamed pale,"
7748,A BALLAD.,"And she saw a snake on the craggy rock,"
7749,A BALLAD.,It clung by its slimy tail.
7750,A BALLAD.,
7751,A BALLAD.,"Her foot it slipp'd, and she stood aghast,"
7752,A BALLAD.,She trod on a bloated toad;
7753,A BALLAD.,"Yet, still upheld by the secret charm,"
7754,A BALLAD.,She kept upon her road.
7755,A BALLAD.,
7756,A BALLAD.,And now upon her frozen ear
7757,A BALLAD.,Mysterious sounds arose;
7758,A BALLAD.,"So, on the mountain's piny top"
7759,A BALLAD.,The blustering north wind blows.
7760,A BALLAD.,
7761,A BALLAD.,Then furious peals of laughter loud
7762,A BALLAD.,"Were heard with thundering sound,"
7763,A BALLAD.,"Till they died away in soft decay,"
7764,A BALLAD.,Low whispering o'er the ground.
7765,A BALLAD.,
7766,A BALLAD.,"Yet still the maiden onward went,"
7767,A BALLAD.,"The charm yet onward led,"
7768,A BALLAD.,Though each big glaring ball of sight
7769,A BALLAD.,Seem'd bursting from her head.
7770,A BALLAD.,
7771,A BALLAD.,"But now a pale blue light she saw,"
7772,A BALLAD.,It from a distance came;
7773,A BALLAD.,"She follow'd, till upon her sight"
7774,A BALLAD.,Burst full a flood of flame.
7775,A BALLAD.,
7776,A BALLAD.,She stood appall'd; yet still the charm
7777,A BALLAD.,Upheld her sinking soul;
7778,A BALLAD.,"Yet each bent knee the other smote,"
7779,A BALLAD.,And each wild eye did roll.
7780,A BALLAD.,
7781,A BALLAD.,And such a sight as she saw there
7782,A BALLAD.,"No mortal saw before,"
7783,A BALLAD.,And such a sight as she saw there
7784,A BALLAD.,No mortal shall see more.
7785,A BALLAD.,
7786,A BALLAD.,"A burning cauldron stood in the midst,"
7787,A BALLAD.,"The flame was fierce and high,"
7788,A BALLAD.,And all the cave so wide and long
7789,A BALLAD.,Was plainly seen thereby.
7790,A BALLAD.,
7791,A BALLAD.,And round about the cauldron stout
7792,A BALLAD.,Twelve withered witches stood;
7793,A BALLAD.,"Their waists were bound with living snakes,"
7794,A BALLAD.,And their hair was stiff with blood.
7795,A BALLAD.,
7796,A BALLAD.,Their hands were gory too; and red
7797,A BALLAD.,And fiercely flamed their eyes:
7798,A BALLAD.,And they were muttering indistinct
7799,A BALLAD.,Their hellish mysteries.
7800,A BALLAD.,
7801,A BALLAD.,"And suddenly they join'd their hands,"
7802,A BALLAD.,"And utter'd a joyous cry,"
7803,A BALLAD.,And round about the cauldron stout
7804,A BALLAD.,They danced right merrily.
7805,A BALLAD.,
7806,A BALLAD.,And now they stopp'd; and each prepared
7807,A BALLAD.,"To tell what she had done,"
7808,A BALLAD.,Since last the lady of the night
7809,A BALLAD.,Her waning course had run.
7810,A BALLAD.,
7811,A BALLAD.,"Behind a rock stood Gondoline,"
7812,A BALLAD.,"Thick weeds her face did veil,"
7813,A BALLAD.,"And she lean'd fearful forwarder,"
7814,A BALLAD.,To hear the dreadful tale.
7815,A BALLAD.,
7816,A BALLAD.,The first arose: She said she'd seen
7817,A BALLAD.,"Rare sport since the blind cat mew'd,"
7818,A BALLAD.,"She'd been to sea in a leaky sieve,"
7819,A BALLAD.,And a jovial storm had brew'd.
7820,A BALLAD.,
7821,A BALLAD.,"She'd called around the winged winds,"
7822,A BALLAD.,And raised a devilish rout;
7823,A BALLAD.,"And she laugh'd so loud, the peals were heard"
7824,A BALLAD.,Full fifteen leagues about.
7825,A BALLAD.,
7826,A BALLAD.,She said there was a little bark
7827,A BALLAD.,"Upon the roaring wave,"
7828,A BALLAD.,And there was a woman there who'd been
7829,A BALLAD.,To see her husband's grave.
7830,A BALLAD.,
7831,A BALLAD.,"And she had got a child in her arms,"
7832,A BALLAD.,"It was her only child,"
7833,A BALLAD.,And oft its little infant pranks
7834,A BALLAD.,Her heavy heart beguiled.
7835,A BALLAD.,
7836,A BALLAD.,And there was too in that same bark
7837,A BALLAD.,A father and his son:
7838,A BALLAD.,"The lad was sickly, and the sire"
7839,A BALLAD.,Was old and woe-begone.
7840,A BALLAD.,
7841,A BALLAD.,"And when the tempest waxed strong,"
7842,A BALLAD.,"And the bark could no more it 'bide,"
7843,A BALLAD.,She said it was jovial fun to hear
7844,A BALLAD.,How the poor devils cried.
7845,A BALLAD.,
7846,A BALLAD.,The mother clasp'd her orphan child
7847,A BALLAD.,Unto her breast and wept;
7848,A BALLAD.,And sweetly folded in her arms
7849,A BALLAD.,The careless baby slept.
7850,A BALLAD.,
7851,A BALLAD.,"And she told how, in the shape of the wind,"
7852,A BALLAD.,"As manfully it roar'd,"
7853,A BALLAD.,"She twisted her hand in the infant's hair,"
7854,A BALLAD.,And threw it overboard.
7855,A BALLAD.,
7856,A BALLAD.,"And to have seen the mother's pangs,"
7857,A BALLAD.,'Twas a glorious sight to see;
7858,A BALLAD.,The crew could scarcely hold her down
7859,A BALLAD.,From jumping in the sea.
7860,A BALLAD.,
7861,A BALLAD.,"The hag held a lock of her hair in her hand,"
7862,A BALLAD.,And it was soft and fair:
7863,A BALLAD.,"It must have been a lovely child,"
7864,A BALLAD.,To have had such lovely hair.
7865,A BALLAD.,
7866,A BALLAD.,And she said the father in his arms
7867,A BALLAD.,"He held his sickly son,"
7868,A BALLAD.,"And his dying throes they fast arose,"
7869,A BALLAD.,His pains were nearly done.
7870,A BALLAD.,
7871,A BALLAD.,"And she throttled the youth with her sinewy hands,"
7872,A BALLAD.,And his face grew deadly blue;
7873,A BALLAD.,"And the father he tore his thin gray hair,"
7874,A BALLAD.,And kiss'd the livid hue.
7875,A BALLAD.,
7876,A BALLAD.,And then she told how she bored a hole
7877,A BALLAD.,"In the bark, and it fill'd away:"
7878,A BALLAD.,"And 'twas rare to hear how some did swear,"
7879,A BALLAD.,And some did vow and pray.
7880,A BALLAD.,
7881,A BALLAD.,"The man and woman they soon were dead,"
7882,A BALLAD.,The sailors their strength did urge;
7883,A BALLAD.,"But the billows that beat were their winding-sheet,"
7884,A BALLAD.,And the winds sung their funeral dirge.
7885,A BALLAD.,
7886,A BALLAD.,"She threw the infant's hair in the fire,"
7887,A BALLAD.,"The red flame flamed high,"
7888,A BALLAD.,And round about the cauldron stout
7889,A BALLAD.,They danced right merrily.
7890,A BALLAD.,
7891,A BALLAD.,The second begun: She said she had done
7892,A BALLAD.,"The task that Queen Hecate had set her,"
7893,A BALLAD.,"And that the devil, the father of evil,"
7894,A BALLAD.,Had never accomplished a better.
7895,A BALLAD.,
7896,A BALLAD.,"She said, there was an aged woman,"
7897,A BALLAD.,"And she had a daughter fair,"
7898,A BALLAD.,Whose evil habits fill'd her heart
7899,A BALLAD.,With misery and care.
7900,A BALLAD.,
7901,A BALLAD.,"The daughter had a paramour,"
7902,A BALLAD.,"A wicked man was he,"
7903,A BALLAD.,And oft the woman him against
7904,A BALLAD.,Did murmur grievously.
7905,A BALLAD.,
7906,A BALLAD.,And the hag had work'd the daughter up
7907,A BALLAD.,"To murder her old mother,"
7908,A BALLAD.,"That then she might seize on all her goods,"
7909,A BALLAD.,And wanton with her lover.
7910,A BALLAD.,
7911,A BALLAD.,And one night as the old woman
7912,A BALLAD.,Was sick and ill in bed.
7913,A BALLAD.,And pondering solely on the life
7914,A BALLAD.,"Her wicked daughter led,"
7915,A BALLAD.,
7916,A BALLAD.,"She heard her footstep on the floor,"
7917,A BALLAD.,"And she raised her pallid head,"
7918,A BALLAD.,"And she saw her daughter, with a knife,"
7919,A BALLAD.,Approaching to her bed.
7920,A BALLAD.,
7921,A BALLAD.,"And said, My child, I'm very ill,"
7922,A BALLAD.,"I have not long to live,"
7923,A BALLAD.,"Now kiss my cheek, that ere I die"
7924,A BALLAD.,Thy sins I may forgive.
7925,A BALLAD.,
7926,A BALLAD.,"And the murderess bent to kiss her cheek,"
7927,A BALLAD.,"And she lifted the sharp bright knife,"
7928,A BALLAD.,"And the mother saw her fell intent,"
7929,A BALLAD.,And hard she begg'd for life.
7930,A BALLAD.,
7931,A BALLAD.,"But prayers would nothing her avail,"
7932,A BALLAD.,"And she scream'd aloud with fear,"
7933,A BALLAD.,"But the house was lone, and the piercing screams"
7934,A BALLAD.,Could reach no human ear
7935,A BALLAD.,
7936,A BALLAD.,"And though that she was sick, and old,"
7937,A BALLAD.,"She struggled hard, and fought;"
7938,A BALLAD.,The murderess cut three fingers through
7939,A BALLAD.,Ere she could reach her throat.
7940,A BALLAD.,
7941,A BALLAD.,"And the hag she held her fingers up,"
7942,A BALLAD.,"The skin was mangled sore,"
7943,A BALLAD.,And they all agreed a nobler deed
7944,A BALLAD.,Was never done before.
7945,A BALLAD.,
7946,A BALLAD.,"And she threw the fingers in the fire,"
7947,A BALLAD.,"The red flame flamed high,"
7948,A BALLAD.,And round about the cauldron stout
7949,A BALLAD.,They danced right merrily.
7950,A BALLAD.,
7951,A BALLAD.,The third arose: She said she'd been
7952,A BALLAD.,To holy Palestine;
7953,A BALLAD.,And seen more blood in one short day
7954,A BALLAD.,Than they had all seen in nine.
7955,A BALLAD.,
7956,A BALLAD.,"Now Gondoline, with fearful steps,"
7957,A BALLAD.,"Drew nearer to the flame,"
7958,A BALLAD.,For much she dreaded now to hear
7959,A BALLAD.,Her hapless lover's name.
7960,A BALLAD.,
7961,A BALLAD.,The hag related then the sports
7962,A BALLAD.,"Of that eventful day,"
7963,A BALLAD.,When on the well contested field
7964,A BALLAD.,Full fifteen thousand lay.
7965,A BALLAD.,
7966,A BALLAD.,She said that she in human gore
7967,A BALLAD.,"Above the knees did wade,"
7968,A BALLAD.,And that no tongue could truly tell
7969,A BALLAD.,The tricks she there had play'd.
7970,A BALLAD.,
7971,A BALLAD.,"There was a gallant featured youth,"
7972,A BALLAD.,Who like a hero fought;
7973,A BALLAD.,"He kiss'd a bracelet on his wrist,"
7974,A BALLAD.,And every danger sought.
7975,A BALLAD.,
7976,A BALLAD.,"And in a vassal's garb disguised,"
7977,A BALLAD.,"Unto the knight she sues,"
7978,A BALLAD.,"And tells him she from Britain comes,"
7979,A BALLAD.,And brings unwelcome news.
7980,A BALLAD.,
7981,A BALLAD.,That three days ere she had embark'd
7982,A BALLAD.,His love had given her hand
7983,A BALLAD.,Unto a wealthy Thane:--and thought
7984,A BALLAD.,Him dead in Holy Land.
7985,A BALLAD.,
7986,A BALLAD.,And to have seen how he did writhe
7987,A BALLAD.,"When this her tale she told,"
7988,A BALLAD.,It would have made a wizard's blood
7989,A BALLAD.,Within his heart run cold.
7990,A BALLAD.,
7991,A BALLAD.,"Then fierce he spurr'd his warrior steed,"
7992,A BALLAD.,And sought the battle's bed;
7993,A BALLAD.,And soon all mangled o'er with wounds
7994,A BALLAD.,He on the cold turf bled.
7995,A BALLAD.,
7996,A BALLAD.,And from his smoking corse she tore
7997,A BALLAD.,"His head, half clove in two."
7998,A BALLAD.,"She ceased, and from beneath her garb"
7999,A BALLAD.,The bloody trophy drew.
8000,A BALLAD.,
8001,A BALLAD.,"The eyes were starting from their socks,"
8002,A BALLAD.,"The mouth it ghastly grinn'd,"
8003,A BALLAD.,"And there was a gash across the brow,"
8004,A BALLAD.,The scalp was nearly skinn'd.
8005,A BALLAD.,
8006,A BALLAD.,'Twas Bertrand's head! With a terrible scream
8007,A BALLAD.,The maiden gave a spring
8008,A BALLAD.,And from her fearful hiding-place
8009,A BALLAD.,She fell into the ring.
8010,A BALLAD.,
8011,A BALLAD.,"The lights they fled--the cauldron sunk,"
8012,A BALLAD.,"Deep thunders shook the dome,"
8013,A BALLAD.,And hollow peals of laughter came
8014,A BALLAD.,Resounding through the gloom.
8015,A BALLAD.,
8016,A BALLAD.,Insensible the maiden lay
8017,A BALLAD.,"Upon the hellish ground,"
8018,A BALLAD.,And still mysterious sounds were heard
8019,A BALLAD.,At intervals around.
8020,A BALLAD.,
8021,A BALLAD.,She woke--she half arose--and wild
8022,A BALLAD.,"She cast a horrid glare,"
8023,A BALLAD.,"The sounds had ceased, the lights had fled,"
8024,A BALLAD.,And all was stillness there.
8025,A BALLAD.,
8026,A BALLAD.,And through an awning in the rock
8027,A BALLAD.,"The moon it sweetly shone,"
8028,A BALLAD.,And show'd a river in the cave
8029,A BALLAD.,Which dismally did moan.
8030,A BALLAD.,
8031,A BALLAD.,"The stream was black, it sounded deep"
8032,A BALLAD.,"As it rush'd the rocks between,"
8033,A BALLAD.,"It offer'd well, for madness fired"
8034,A BALLAD.,The breast of Gondoline.
8035,A BALLAD.,
8036,A BALLAD.,"She plunged in, the torrent moan'd"
8037,A BALLAD.,"With its accustom'd sound,"
8038,A BALLAD.,And hollow peals of laughter loud
8039,A BALLAD.,Again rebellow'd round.
8040,A BALLAD.,
8041,A BALLAD.,The maid was seen no more.--But oft
8042,A BALLAD.,"Her ghost is known to glide,"
8043,A BALLAD.,"At midnight's silent, solemn hour,"
8044,A BALLAD.,Along the ocean's side.
8045,A BALLAD.,

8052,A BALLAD.,"Ye pelting rains, a little rest;"
8053,A BALLAD.,"Lie still, lie still, ye busy thoughts,"
8054,A BALLAD.,That wring with grief my aching breast.
8055,A BALLAD.,
8056,A BALLAD.,"Oh! cruel was my faithless love,"
8057,A BALLAD.,To triumph o'er an artless maid;
8058,A BALLAD.,"Oh! cruel was my faithless love,"
8059,A BALLAD.,To leave the breast by him betray'd.
8060,A BALLAD.,
8061,A BALLAD.,"When exiled from my native home,"
8062,A BALLAD.,He should have wiped the bitter tear;
8063,A BALLAD.,"Nor left me faint and lone to roam,"
8064,A BALLAD.,A heart-sick weary wanderer here.
8065,A BALLAD.,
8066,A BALLAD.,"My child moans sadly in my arms,"
8067,A BALLAD.,The winds they will not let it sleep:
8068,A BALLAD.,"Ah, little knows the hapless babe"
8069,A BALLAD.,What makes its wretched mother weep!
8070,A BALLAD.,
8071,A BALLAD.,"Now lie thee still, my infant dear,"
8072,A BALLAD.,"I cannot bear thy sobs to see,"
8073,A BALLAD.,"Harsh is thy father, little one,"
8074,A BALLAD.,And never will he shelter thee.
8075,A BALLAD.,
8076,A BALLAD.,"Oh, that I were but in my grave,"
8077,A BALLAD.,"And winds were piping o'er me loud,"
8078,A BALLAD.,"And thou, my poor, my orphan babe,"
8079,A BALLAD.,Wert nestling in thy mother's shroud!
